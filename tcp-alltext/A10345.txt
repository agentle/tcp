            Wherein by the way are handled sundrie points, of the sufficiencie and right expounding of the Scriptures, the ministerie of the Church, the function of Priesthood, the sacrifice of the Masse, with other controuersies of religion: but chiefly and purposely the point of Church-gouerment, opened in the branches of Christes supreme soueraintie, of Peters pretended, the Popes vsurped, the Princes lawfull Supremacie.
            
            Penned by Iohn Rainoldes, according to the notes set downe in writing by them both: perused by Iohn Hart, and (after things supplied, & altered, as he thought good) allowed for the faithfull report of that which past in conference betwene them.
            Whereto is annexed a Treatise intitled, SIX CONCLVSIONS TOVCHING THE HOLIE SCRIPTVRE AND THE CHVRCH, writen by Iohn Rainoldes.
            With a defense of such thinges as Thomas Stapleton and Gregorie Martin haue carped at therein.

               whose taile drew the third part of the starres of heauen, & cast them to the earth, that they haue bene turned into seminaries of false Prophets: to maintaine errours and the power of darkenesse, against the light and truth of Christ.

The primitiue Church had experience hereof in them Act. 6. ver. 9. 
               of the Synagogue of Libertines, and Cyrenians, who disputed with Steuen. A lesson for the faithfull in the ages to folow, that they should not thinke it strange, or be dismayed, if Schooles & Vniuersities of men professing wisedome were possessed of folie, and sought to peruert the straight wayes of the Lord. The consideration whereof, as it was needefull for our predecessours, when Rabbines of the Iewes, Philosophers of the Heathēs, Sorbonists amōg Christians, being seduced themselues, seduced others: so haue the Seminaries of our English students (erected by the Pope of late at Rome and Rhemes) made it needeful also for vs at this day. The more: how much the nerer their dealings do come to those of the Synagogue of Libertines & Cyrenians. For as they defended ver. 14. the Iewish opinions receiued by tradition from their Fathers: so do the Seminaries the Popish superstitions. As they did pretend the care of religion, ver. 11. of Moses, and God, the law, & the Temple: so do the Seminaries, of the Catholike faith, the Scriptures, and the Church. As the meanes they vsed were sclanders of Steuen, ver. 13. that he spake blasphemous wordes against the holy place, and the law: so do the Seminaries charge vs with reuolting

from the holy Church, and corrupting the Scriptures. I am not worthie to be compared with the least ofthe seruants of God, who liued at that time, in which he powred the giftes of his holy spirit from heauen so aboundantly. Howbeit, as it pleased him to rayse Steuen to dispute with some of the Iewish Synagogue: so hath he vouchsafed me of this fauour, that I should be called to conferre with certaine ofthe Popish Seminaries. Of whom, one, contented to proceede farther therin then the rest; by writing, not by word onely: hath giuen occasion ofthis, which here I publish. Wherein how indifferently he hath bene dealt with: himselfe hath declared. My conscience, for mine owne part, beareth me witnesse that I haue endeuored to defend the cause of the same truth, with the same purpose, by the same principles, & groūds, that Act. 7.2. 
               Steuē
                did. Wishing from my hart, (if so it please God,) that it may preuaile more with English Papists, then Steuens speech did with the Iewish Priests. But ready (by his grace) to endure their spite, ifthey hate me for telling them the truth, as the Iewes did him. Now, sith Luke, who penned the story of Steuen, sent it to Act. 1.1.

            Iohn Hart to the indifferent Reader.
            
               BEhold (gentle Reader) the conference, which thou hast so long looked for, betweene M. Rainoldes and me, at length ended: as also it had beene more then twelue monethes since, had not my selfe hindred the cōming of it foorth, when it was nigh readie to be deliuered to the Printer. For it is now aboue two yeares ago, that the right honorable, Syr Francis Walsingham, as he had shewed me great fauour from the time that I was apprehended, in graunting me libertie of conference at home, first in mine owne countrie, and afterwarde in prison: so, when the sentence of death was past vpon me, hee ceased not still to offer me the same fauour if I would admit it. VVhich I, grounding my selfe vpon the most certayne foundation of the Church so strengthened by God that it shall stand for euer, did gladly yeeld to, and (as became me) accepted of it with all dutie. VVherevpon his Honour sent for M. Rainoldes to conferre with me: taking order also that I should be furnished with whatsoeuer bookes I did neede thereto. But after we had spent certayne

weekes together in conference by word of mouth, and I continued still in my former mind: he desired to haue the summe thereof in writing, that he might see the groundes on which I stood. And to this intent we set downe together breefe notes of the points that we dealt in: I shewing my reasons with the places of the autours whose iudgement and learning I rather trusted too, then to my owne skill; and M. Rainoldes answering them in such sort as he thought good. Howbeit, those notes being so short (as pointing to thinges rather then vnfolding them) that they could not well bee vnderstood by any, but our selues onely, vnlesse they were drawne more largely and at full: my selfe being troubled then with more necessary cogitations of death, (as altogether vncertaine when I might be called to yeeld vp mine account before God and man,) requested M. Rainoldes to take paines to penne them according to our notes thereof. Promising him that I would peruse it when he had doon it, and allow of it, if it were to my mind; or otherwise correct, if I misliked ought in it. This paines he vndertooke, and sending me the partes thereof from time to time as he finished them, I noted such thinges as I would haue added, or altered therein, and he performed it accordingly. But when I perceiued that it was prepared to be set foorth in print: I sought meanes to stay it all that I could, for some considerations

which seemed to me very great and important. Marry since that againe vnderstāding it to be his Honours pleasure that it should go forward, wherevnto he granted me also by speciall warrant the vse of such bookes as I should call for to helpe my selfe withall: I set afresh vpon it, & by letters written vnto M. Rainoldes & receiued from him, I had mine owne speeches & reasons perfitted, as I would. VVherefore, I acknowledge that he hath set downe herein a true report of those things which past in conference betweene vs, according to the grounds and places of the autours, which I had quoted & referred my self too. As for that which he affirmeth

                in one place, that I haue told him, that my opinion is, the Pope may not depose Princes: in deede I told him so much. And in truth I thinke that although the spiritual power be more excellēt & worthie thē the temporall; yet they are both of God, neither doth the one depend of the other. VVherevpon I gather as a certaine conclusion, that the opinion of them, who holde the Pope to be a temporall Lord ouer Kings & Princes, is vnreasonable and vnprobable altogether. For he hath not to meddle with thē or theirs ciuilly, much lesse to depose them or giue away their kingdomes: that is no part of his commission. He hath in my iudgment the Fatherhoode of the Church, not a Princehood of the world: Christ himself taking no such title vpon him,

nor giuing it to Peter, or any other of his disciples. And that is it which I meant to defend in him, and no other soueraintie. Humbly desiring pardon of her Maiestie, my gratious soueraine Lady, for my plaine dealing in that, which (so Christ helpe me) I take to be Gods cause, and the Churches only. As I do also most willingly submit my selfe to the curteous correction of all men, who, through greater skill, and perfitter iudgement, see more then I doe in the depth of these matters whereof I haue conferred. Farewell, gentle Reader: and now that I haue shewed thee my dealing herein, let me obtaine this little request at thy handes, that thou be not too hasty in giuing thy iudgemēt, before thou hast weighed all things sincerely and vprightly.

                  BRethren, my harts desire & prayer vnto God for Israel is, that they may bee saued. For that which S. Rom. 10.

Of whom I haue the greater compassion and pitie, because I am perswaded that you sinne of ignorance rather then of wilfulnesse; and haue a deuotion to serue God aright, though not the right way wherein he will be serued. That I may iustly say the same vnto you, which S. Rom. 10.2. 
               Paule of thē: For I beare you record that you haue the zeale of God, but not according to knowledge. The zeale, which the Israelites had, was of Act. 22.3. 
               the law. The knowledge, which they wāted, was the true meaning of it. For they expounded it after Gal.

their Fathers: and knowing not Rom. 10.4. 
               Christ to be the ende thereof, they sought their owne righteousnesse against the righteousnesse of God. The zeale, which you haue, is of the Gospel. The knowledge, which you want, is the true meaning of it too. For you are instructed to vnderstand it Allen in the Apologie, of the English Seminari

Whereby your seducer beareth you in hand, that chapt. 2. the Pope is supreme head of the Church; chapt. 3. the trade of Popish Priesthoode, the way to saue soules; chapt. 1. & 6. the sacrifice of Popish Masse, the souerain sacrifice; in a word, chapt. 5. that Papistrie is the Catholike faith: and chapt. 1. &▪ 5. the faith and seruice of the Church of England is cursed and damnable; specially, chapt. 1. & 4. 
               the oth of the Queenes supremacie. And your mindes are taken so with these opinions, that you are content to venture as farre in the defense of them, as the Donatists did, who loued their errours better then their liues. Great zeale, but not according to knowledge, my brethren. For the Gospell teacheth not that which you imagin; your Fathers were abused by Phariseis & Rabbines: your Pope hath vs
                  •
               rped ouer all Christian states; your Priesthoode is impious; your Masse, abominatiō; your Popish faith, heresie; our doctrine of the Queenes supremacie, & oth thereto, our ministerie of the word, of sacraments,
               
of prayers, agreeth with the Gospell, and therefore is holy. Which thinges sith this Conference, that one of your Seminarie-Priests, and I haue had, doth open & proue: peruse it (
                  •

Perhaps your Superiors (the Esai. 9.16. guides who seduce you) will not giue you leaue to reade it and peruse it. But there are two reasōs which should moue them to cōdescend thereto: the one, of the worke; the other, of the autours. The worke, is a conference: which thēselues haue called for.

If you haue the spirite of Daniel and his felowes: you wil see as much in the Popes double loue, and liberalitie. Sure, hee geueth iuster cause to distrust it, then the King did. For, the Kings drift in trayning vp them, that they might stand before him, was only that ver. 4. & 19. they should attend and waite vpon him, as courtiers, in his palace.

The practise of the supremacie (which Peter is entitled to) imagined to be proued, 1 by the election of Matthias to the Apostleship: 2 by the Presidentship of the Councell held at Ierusalem: 3 and by Paules iourney taken to see Peter, and his abode with him. Wherein, as in other of the actes of the Apostles, the equalitie of them all, not the supremacie of one is shewed.

                  The fifth Chapter. The Fathers 1 are no touch-stone for triall of the truth in controuersies ofreligion, but the scripture onely. 2 Their writings are corrupted: and counterfeits do beare their names. 3 The sayinges, alleaged out of their right writings, proue not the pretended supremacie of Peter.

                  The sixth Chapter. The two maine groundes, on which the supremacie vsurped by the Pope, doth lye. The former, that there should bee one Bishop ouer all in earth: 1 because Christ sayd, There shall be one flock, and one Pastour; 2 And among the Iewes there was one iudge, and hie Priest. The later, that the Pope is that one Bishop: 3 because Peter was Bishop of Rome (as some say,) 4 and the Pope succeedeth Peter. Both examined, and shewed to faile in the proofe of the Popes supremacie.

The scriptures falsly sayd to bee alleaged by the Fathers for the supremacie of the Pope, as successour to Peter. 1 Feede my sheepe, strengthen thy brethren, and, that thy faith faile not, belong no more to Popes then to other Bishops. 2 The Pope may erre in doctrine, 3 not only as a priuate man, but as Pope: 4 yea, preach false doctrine also.

                  The eighth Chapter. The autoritie 1 of traditions and Fathers pretended to proue the Popes supremacie: in vaine; beside the scripture, which is the onely rule of faith. The Fathers, 2 being heard with lawfull exceptions that may bee iustly taken against them, 3 doo not proue it. As it is shewed first, in Fathers of the Church of Rome. By the way, 4 the name of Priest, the Priestly sacrifice of Christians, the Popish sacrifice of Masse-priestes, the proofes brought for the Masse, the substance and ceremonies of it, are laid open. And so it is declared that 5 nether the ancient Bishops of Rome them selues, 6 nor any other Fathers doo proue the Popes supremacy.

                     The first Diuision.
                   from the Right honorable M. Secretarie Walsyngham, the cause why he hath sent for me to come vnto you: to conferre with you concerning matters of religion, for the better informing of your conscience and iudgement. In the which respect you signified vnto him your selfe to bee willing to conferre with any man: so that you might be charitably and Christianly dealt withall.
            
            
               Hart.
               In deede I did signifie so much to M. Secretarie: neither am I vnwilling to do that I haue promised. Howbeit, I wish rather, that if a conference be purposed, the learned men of our side, whome we haue many beyond sea, might be sent for hether, of riper yeares, and sounder iudgement. As for mée: the condition of conference with you is somewhat vn-euen. For I lie in prison, and am adiudged to dye: the closenesse of the one, & terror of the other, doth dull a mans spirits, and make him very vnfitte for study. I neither am of great yeares, nor euer was of great reading: and yet of that which I haue read I haue forgotten much, by reason of my long restraint. I am destitute of bookes: we are not permitted to haue any at all, sauing the Bible onely. You of the other side may haue bookes at will: and you come fresh from the vniuersitie: whereby you are the readier to vse them and alleage them. These are great disaduantages, for me to enter into conference with you. Neuerthelesse, I am content, as I haue said, to do it: so that my wantes may be supplied with furniture of bookes, such as I shall desire.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The learned men of your side, it lyeth not in me to procure hether. I would to God none of them had euer come from Rome with traiterous intente, nay more then intent:

in it dayly, by reading ouer certaine Chapters, wherein the hard places were all expounded, the doubtes noted, the controuersies which arise betwixt you and vs resolued, the arguments, which our side can bring vnto the contrarie, perspicuously and fully answered. So that with this armour you are the more strongly prepared against me: who can be content to deale with you in conference by that booke alone, as by the booke of all trueth.

But this I must request you, to looke on the originalles of Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, which they doe alleadge. For they doe perswade you that all doe make for you: but they abuse you in it. They borrow some gold out of the Lordes treasure house, and wine out of the Doctors presses▪ but they are deceitful workmen, they do corrupt their golde with drosse, their wine with worse then water.

               And you shall finde it harder to make proofe of halfe, then to make claime of all. Yet you shall see both youre claime of all the Scriptures and Fathers to bee more confidente then iust: and my reproofe of your wryters for theyr corrupting and forging of them, as plainly prooued as vttered, if you haue eyes to see. God lighten your eyes, that you may see: & open your eares, that you may heare: and geue you both a softe hart and vnderstanding minde, that you may be able wisely to discerne, and gladly to embrace the trueth when you shall heare it.

               UUill you then (to lay the ground of our conference) let me know the causes why you separate your selfe, and refuse to communicate with the Church of England in prayers and religion?
            
            
               Hart.
               The causes are not many. They may be al comprysed in one. Your Church is no Church: You are not members of the Church.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               How proue you that?
            
            
               Hart.
               By this argument. The Church is a companie of Christian men professing one faith, vnder one head. You professe not one faith, vnder one head. Therefore you are not of the Church.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               What is that one faith?
            
            
               Hart.
               The catholike faith.

               Rainoldes.
               Then both the propositions, of which you frame your argument, are in part faultie. The first, in that you say, the church is a companie of Christian men vnder one head. The second, in that you charge vs of the church of England, that wee professe not one faith. For we do professe that one faith, the catholike faith. But we deny that the church is bound to be subiect to that one head, the bishop of Rome.
            
            
               Hart.
               I will proue the pointes of both my propositions, the which you haue denied. First, that the church must be subiect to the Bishop of Rome as to her head. Next, that the faith, which you professe in England is not the catholike faith.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               You will say somewhat for them: but you will neuer proue them.
            
            
               Hart.
               Let the church iudge. For the first, thus I proue it.
                     The second Diuision.
                   
                  S. Peter was head of all the Apostles. The Bishop of Rome succeedeth Peter, in the same power ouer Bishops, that he had ouer the Apostles. Therefore the Bishop of Rome is head of all Bishops. If of Bishops; then by consequent of the dioceses subiect to them. If of all their dioceses; then of the whole church. The Bishop of

Rome therefore is head of the whole church of Christ.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  S. Peter was head of all the Apostles? The Bishop of Rome is head of all Bishops? I had thought that Christ our Sauiour both was, and is the head, as of the whole church, so of Apostles, of Bishops, of all the members of it. For the church is his body: and he alone performeth the dutie of an head vnto it, by giuing it power of life, of feeling, of mouing: and 
                     Ephes 1.2

                  him hath God appointed to be the head to the Church, and 
                     Colos. 2.19. 
                  by him all the body furnished and knit togither by iointes and bandes, encreaseth with the encreasing of God.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               We graunt that Christ is properly the head of the church, the principall and quickning head. But this head is imperiall, so to terme him, and inuisible. The Pope is a visible, and ministeriall head: yet in truth a head also. 
                     Staplet. principior. doctr. lib. 6. cap. 16. For of the head there are two dueties: the one, to bee the fountaine out of the which there floweth life into the rest of the body; the other, to direct 
                     Suo imperio.
                   by his rule and power the outward functions of the body. The former duety doth agree to God alone and Christ. The later, to the seruice and ministery of men too.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               This your answere of two heades doth stand with more reason, then Pope Boniface the 8. c. vnam sanctam. extra. De maio

                   his, who said that Christ, and Christes vicar Peter, and Peters successor the Pope, are all but one head of the church. Howbeit, so to make a twofold head, as you do, by the variety of two dueties: it is not to diuide but to rent a sunder the dueties of the head, and to make the Pope a head imperiall rather then a ministeriall. For, by rule and power to direct either the inward or outward functions of the bodie, is the chiefe and proper function of the head, agréeing to that head alone, that giueth power of life and féeling and mouing to the body. Wherefore, sith Christ, hauing bound him selfe by his promise 
                     Mat. 28.20. 
                  to be with vs vntill the end of the world, doth giue this power vnto his church by the effectuall working of his holy spirite, which doth quicken both the whole and euery member of his body: they who do diuide the preeminence of this duety betwéene him and the Pope, allotting to him the inward, to the Pope the outward functions to be directed, deserue to be attainted of treason against the Lord. For séeing that to exercise this rule and dominion, is a prerogatiue royall, and proper to the king of kings: to giue it either in whole or in part to any subiect, can not be a lesser offence

then hie treason.
            
            
               Hart.
               If you account this to be treason against the Lord, and do attaint vs of it: You must attaint him selfe of it, who by his word hath brought vs to it. For S. Paule comparing the church vnto a body, to shew the sundry giftes of Christians, and in their sundry giftes their seuerall dueties by the similitude of members, doth mention a head amongst them: 1. Cor. 12.21. 
                  The e
                        •
                     e cannot say vnto the hand, I haue no neede of thee, nor the head to the feete, I haue no neede of you. Here the name of head must by al likelyhood bee meant of the Pastor in respect of the flock. But it cannot be meant of Christ. For he may say to vs, I haue no neede of you: and so he willeth vs also 
                     Luc. 17.10. 
                  (when we shal haue done all things that are cōmanded vs) to say, we are vnprofitable seruants. It must be meant therefore of Peter in respect of the rest of the Apostles, and by consequent of the Pope in respect of all Bishops.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               If Paule had so meant it, either of Peter or of the Pope: he had a tongue of the learned, he could easily haue so expounded it. But, in the applying of his similitude to his purpose, he sheweth that he meant, by the name of head, them who had the greatest graces of Gods spirite: by feete, hands, and eies, them who not so great, though greater some then other.
            
            
               Hart.
               Them who had the greatest? Nay: the name of head doth shew it must be one, and that, one visible head (which wée call a ministeriall head vnder Christ) proportionable to the body of Christ, I meane the Church. Of the which visible and ministeriall head those wordes of S. Paule may bee truely verified, The head cannot say to the feete, I haue no neede of you.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Indeede, if the Pope be signified by the head, those words will fitte him well. For 
                     Reginald. Pol. Card. pro ecclesiast. vnitat. defens. ad Henric. octau. lib. 1. Cardinall Poole discoursing on the same reason of the Popes supremacie, doth make as him the head, so kings to be the féete. And it is true the Pope can not say to kings, I haue no neede of you. It would bée hard going for him if they were not. But if, because Saint Paule doth in that similitude mention a head, therefore there must be one visible head proportionable to the body of Christ, that is, ye Church: then because S. Paule doth mention the féete, there must bee néedes also two visible féete, by the like proportion. Now I would gladly know of you Maister Hart, which you will make

the two féete of your church. The Emperour I trow, must be the right foote. The left, who? The king of Spaine? What shall the French king do then? It is well that the king of Scots is no member of it: nor the king of Denmarke. Marry we had newes of the king of Swethland that Iesuits had conuerted him. Shal he be the left foote? Or shall the king of Poleland set in a foote for it? Or is the king of Boheme nearer it? There is a king of Bungo too,
                     Iesuit. in epist. Iapon. lib. 2. & 4. who is reported to protect your religion in his countries, and The epistle to the Councell see before the epistle of the persecution of Catholicks in England. likewise the Great Turke, & other princes of Mahomets sect: they may be féete in time also. But how many féete may this body haue? May it haue sixe, seauen, eight, may it haue twentie visible féete: and may it not haue ten, not foure, not two, may it haue but one visible head?
            
            
               Hart.
               Cardinall Pole compareth kinges vnto féete, not as though they were the lowest partes of the church, (for hée counteth them as speciall members, though not heads) but because the church in the course of her growth was last of all increased with them, as with féete, and so did make an end of growing.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then in Saint Paules time the church had no féete, but a head without them. And what doth he meane to saye that the head could not speake to the feete, when it had no féete to speake too?
            
            
               Hart.
               Yes, it had féete then, but of an other sort. For they, who were of lower degrees and meaner giftes in the church of Christ, are resembled to féete in comparison of others who were in those respects as hands, and eies, aboue them.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               And do you thinke the church had but two such féete? Or had it many hundreds? For christians were growne 
                     Ac
                           •

               Hart.
               It had (no doubt) many. But you must not racke the members of similitudes beyond the principall pointes whereto they are applied and meant. For els you might infer too, that the church must haue but two eies, and two hands, because a mans body (to which S. Paule resembleth the church) hath no more.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               As you say. Yet this is the mould of your owne reason, wherein you cast the church to haue one visible head proportionable to the body. A fansy more proportionable to the limmes of Popery, then to Saint Paules doctrine touching the

body of Christ. For his drift and purpose therein is to shew, that 1. Cor. 12. ve

                     ver. 27. and 28. so the bodie of Christ, that is to say, the church consisteth of sundry Christians, as members, some of greater gifts and callings then some, the Apostles then yt 
                  teachers, the teachers then the helpers,

                   yet al ioyned together to loue and serue one an other, and kéepe the church in vnitie. wherby it is manifest, first, that in naming 
                     ver. 21. 
                  the head he considereth it not as a head properly, but onely as a principall member. For so he applieth it, naming all Christians, 
                     ver. 27. 
                  members: and calling them the bodie of Christ, he putteth Christ to be the head. Next, that by the name of head so considered, hée meaneth no one man, but all

                  the Apostles, as them who were indued with the chéefest gifts, and placed in the highest function. UUherefore if that word be strained to the vttermost, as far as by the text it may: the proofe that it yeldeth will argue a preeminence of the Apostles in generall ouer the inferiour members of the church, but no power of Peter ouer the rest of the Apostles, much lesse of the Pope ouer his fellow-bishops.
            
            
               Hart.
               Yet this it doth proue, that the name of head is not so giuen vnto Christ, but that it may be giuen vnto a mortall man also. Not as a head properly (you say,) but as a principall member. And what said I els? For I graunted that Christ is properly the head of the church: the Pope improperly. Yet you reproued me for it.

               I reproued you not because you gaue the title of head vnto the Pope, for hee should be a pastour of the church of Rome: and pastours (for their giftes aboue the members of their churches) ought to be like heads, though many of them be tailes

               These thinges are small the most of them, and vsed to encrease a reuerend estimation and opinion of that Sée, to the which our Sauior committed the principalitie and gouernment of his church. As for the pointes that séeme greater in the words of Leo: they may be defended. For where he saieth, that Christ tooke Peter into the fellowship of the indiuisible vnitie: hée might meane vnitie in will not in substance, as Christ doth pray for his disciples, 
                     Ioh. 17.11.

They had encreased such an opinion of the Pope of Rome, Saint Peters See, as they tearmed it: that although hee practised not a principalitie geuē him by Christ, but an outragious tiranny vsurped by him selfe ouer Kings and Nations: yet neither kings nor Nations almost, durst speake against him, at the least resiste him. For if they did offend the Pope, they thought they did offende S. Peter. Now of S. Peter they were taught, that he is porter of heauen gates. They feared the porter would let none in, sauing the Pope his

UUherfore how small soeuer those things of Peter séeme in trifling kindes of common spéeches: they brought no small aduantage to Peter of

Romes Court, and wealth into his Treasurie. It is recorded 
                     Beda ecclesiast. histor. gen.

But to leaue him to the Lords iudgemēt, and come vnto your selfe: you neither séeke for shiftes (you say) to darken the trueth, nor loue the praise of men more then the praise of God. I pray God your déedes be not as plaine to prooue you do it, as the reason which you adde to proue you do it not, is weake. For what although it were a madnesse to doe it? Many things are done which madde men scarce would doe, and yet they that doe them doe think themselues well in their wittes, as

But whether you doe set the praise of men at that price, I leaue it to your owne conscience. That you seeke for shiftes, the thing it self doth crie. For your very answere in the defense of Leo, touching vnitie of will, not vnitie of substance, on these words of his, that 
                     Leo ep. 87. 
                  Christ receiued Peter into the felowship of the indiuisible vnity: is a shifte to shield him from a iust reproofe. Let his owne Discourse speake, and it wil graunt it. For hauing saide before that Christ did place Peter as it were a certaine head, to poure his giftes from him as it were into all the body: to this poynt he knitteth 
                     Hunc enim in consortium indiuiduae vnitatis assumptum id quod ipse erat, voluit nominari.
                   these words by way of proofe. So that if the proofe haue any kin with the thing proued, the words must néedes import some preeminence in Peter aboue all the rest of the Disciples of Christ. But vnitie of wil, wherein 
                     Ioh. 17. vers. 11. Christ doth pray that his Disciples may be one as he is one with his Father, is common vnto all, not peculiar to Peter, 
                  
                     ver. 20. & 21. as Christ himselfe doth shewe. That plaister then of yours hath no vertue in it to salue the sore of Leo. Neither can you cure it indéed with any other. For the vnitie, which the Scriptures doe note in God and vs, is of three sortes: the first of persons in one nature; the second of natures in one person; the third of sundrie natures and persons in one qualitie. In the first is 
                     Deut. 6.4. 
                  One God: In the second is 1. Cor. 8.6. 
                  One Christ: In the third is 
                     Cant. 6.8. 
                  One church.
                  
The Lord receiued not Peter into the first vnitie: wherein the father, the sonne, the holy Ghost, are one God. Not into the second: wherein he himselfe consisting of two natures (God, and man) is one Christ. Into the third, wherein the Churche is one with Christ her head, and the Churches members are one amōgst them selues, he did receaue Peter: but in societie with his brethren, not without them in singularitie.

                  The multitude of the belieuers were of one hart, and of one soule: They all are 
                     Ephes. 4.4. 
                  one body, sanctified by one spirit, through the Sacrament of one baptisme, knit to Christ by one faith, to themselues in one loue, to serue togither one Lord, in one hope and expectation of one eternall blisse and glory. So that, of this vnitie, whereof Peters state and nature is capable, apply which you list vnto the wordes of Leo, either vnitie of will, as you seeme to do; or vnity of grace, as Harding in his Detect. lib. 3. cap. 33. others answere for it; or vnitie of glory, which 
                     Ioh. 17. vers. 22. & 24. Christ did pray for also, and some will like that better: none of these doe reach vnto that maiestie, which Leos wordes aspire to by giuing him the felowship of the indiuisible vnitie. Yet God forbid that any man should suspect of him, that he meant vnitie, either of nature with God, or of person with Christ. He hath deserued better,

                   then to be thought so euill off. But that which in trueth may be said for him, is, that his meaning was (as

                   other-where him selfe doth open it,) that Christ did impart his name of rocke and foundation of the church to Peter. Now, some mist of fansie daisled his eyes, or els he would neuer haue saide thereupon, that Christ receyued Peter into the felowship of the indiuisible vnitie: and that, in such preeminence, as he receyued none but him: chiefly, sith hée imparted his greater names and titles of

                     Chap. 2. Diuis. 1. after. But if yet you see not, that Leo did outreach, in making Peter as it were a felow-head, a partie-rocke, and the halfe-foundation of the Church with Christ: behold a farther felowship, wherein he ioyneth Peter as mate and partner with God, a felowship of power,

                  God hath giuen to Peter a great and a wonderfull felowship of his power: and if he would haue any thing to be common vnto other princes with him, he neuer gaue, but by him, whatsoeuer he gaue to others. Out of

all controuersie these wordes do lift vp Peter vnto the felowship of that glory of which God is so iealous, that he hath protested 
                     Esai. 42.8. 
                  he will not giue it to any other: he hath giuen it to Christ, who is one with himselfe, God of God, light of light: if any man presume to ioyne a mortall creature, whomsoeuer, as companion vnto Christ in it, he robbeth Christ of his honor of the onely mediator betwéene God and man. And what doth he els, who saith (In the places before alleaged. as Leo doth) that S. Peters care shineth ouer Bishops in that their slaunderers are defaced; that Peters merit and autoritie doth strengthen the writings of his seruant against heretikes: that Peter doth not suffer their persons to be stained, who labour for the catholike faith: that the Popes decrees are made by the inspiration of God and S. Peter: that it must be imputed vnto S. Peters workes and merits, if any thing be gotten of God by dayly prayers: that nothing passeth ouer vnto the chiefest of the Church, no not vnto any man, from God, but by S. Peter. Let euery Christian hart, whome the zeale of God hath giuen any warmth vnto, and his Spirit wisedome, be iudge betwéene you and vs: whether that to yeald such power, such authoritie, such souerainetie and rule of the Church of Christ, to any Saint in heauen, be not an empairing of the maiestie, dominion, and soueraine authoritie of the king of Saints, the holy one of Israel. It gréeueth me to speake so much against Leo: whose learning I doe loue, and reuerence his auncient yeares. But 
                     Dan. 7.9.

                  I will not accept the person of any, neither will I giue titles vnto man: for I may not giue titles: If I should doe it a litle, he that made me would take mee away. UUherefore, I doe fréely without curtesie of titles and accepting of persons, professe, that I mislike those hawtie spéeches in Leo: and I thinke that the mysterie of iniquitie so wrought through his ambitious aduancing Peter, that of the egges, which he cherished, two of the most venemous cokcatrices were bred, that euer poysoned the church of Christ: the one, the Popes supremacie, vsurping Princely power ouer the church and common-weale, with breach of faith to God and man: the other, the worshipping of Saintes, wherin that honour is giuen to creatures which

ought to be giuen to the Creator onely. One example may shew them both, euen Hildebrand (called Gregorie the seuenth in his Popedome) who depriuing Henrie ye Emperour of his Empire, and discharging his subiects of their othe of allegiance, pronounced sentence, with such an inuocation of Peter, as a true Christian would trēble to haue heard vsed to any, but to God.

But of this we shall haue fitter occasion to conferre, when we come to the question of the worship of Saintes.

But if your report of his Sermon be true, it is likely that he gaue the name of head to the Quéene in the same meaning that we doe the title of supreme gouernour, which I will proue to be godly: and he denied the Pope to be head in an other meaning, in which that name belongeth vnto Christ alone, condemning them of blasphemy who giue it him so.

which is due to Christ, as he is head properlie: wée maintaine them not. UUe say that as pastors, all who haue the charge to gouerne the church, are heads after a sort, that is improperly, as I termed it: so the Pope, who is the chiefest of them all is the supreme head.

                   it belongeth properlie to the Bishop of Rome. And that is alreadie prooued by the reason which before I made. S. Peter was head of all the Apostles. The Bishop of Rome succeedeth Peter in the same power ouer Bishops that he had ouer the Apostles. The Bishop of Rome therefore is head of all Bishops, and by consequent of their dioceses, that is of all the church of Christ.

               No syr. But to make our anker-holde the surer, the which is fastned on S. Peter, Doctor Allen thought good that in the translation of the new testament into our tongue, which wée were about at Rhemes, 
                  As in their Annotations on Mat. 16.18. they say it should be by Christs words speaking in the Syriake tongue: yea, and by the meaning of the greeke wordes too. Though they keepe the name of rocke in their text, because of the latin. it should be thus englished; Thou art

Peter and vpon this peter. The which I rather folow, then the other of the rocke, because it is agréeable vnto the originall.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               It is not. For the originall is the Gréeke text: and that hath, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . wherto your latin olde translation agreeth, with Petrus and petra: as your selfe alleaged it. The wordes of both which though they differ not so much as Peter and rocke: yet they are not one, as your Peter and peter.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Although the Gréeke wordes 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   differ in termination: yet they are one in meaning, and signify the same thing. For as 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   signifyeth a rocke, so doth 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   in the Athenian language. And it must be noted that Christ spake in Hebrue, or rather in the Syriake tongue: wherein the name, that hée gaue Peter, is 
                     Ioh. 1.42. 
                  Cephas. Now, in the Syriake translation of the testament, that word is the same without difference in both places.

                  : as if a man would say, Thou art Cephas, and vpon this Cephas; or, Thou art Rocke, and vpon this rocke. For Cephas in the Syriake doth signifie a rocke: as 
                     In dictionar. Syro-chald. Regior. Biblior. Tom. 6. 
                  Guido Fabricius a learned linguist sheweth. wherfore the meaning of the word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   must be the same in greeke. And so we may kéepe it well in both places, Thou art Peter and vpon this peter.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The wordes which you alleage are not of the Syriake translation: they are Hebrue. But as the Hebrue 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is one in both places: so the Syriake I graunt hath 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   in thē both. And I gladlie take it (because our Sauiour Christ spake in that tongue) as an exposition of his wordes to Peter. Yet I note by the way, that although your 
                     Session. 4. councell of Trent hath allowed the latin olde trāslation alone as authenticall, and hath decréed thereof that no man shall dare or presume vnder any pretense to reiect it: notwithstanding, you your selues will depart from it, and that not onelie to the originall (which wee should not bee suffred) but also to translations, if they maye séeme to make for you in any point more then your olde doth.
            
            
               Hart.
               We do not reiect that authenticall translation, but open the sense of it, by comparing it with the greeke, and the gréeke with the Syriake.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But if we should doo so in any point against you, this answere would not serue vs: it would be accounted a colour

or pretense, such as your Councell hath condemned.
            
            
               Hart.
               You doe vs great iniurie, in that you séeme to make it all one to reiect the authenticall Latin, and to take aduantage for our selues out of the originall textes.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               For your selues? Nay, I make not that all one. I sayd, If we should doo so, not, If you should do so. For doo you what you list: and all must be soothed as agréeing with your Latin, and opening the sense of it. But if we should take aduantage for our selues by the originall textes: our aduantage would be nipped on the head as a pretense. For example, Andreas Masius, a learned man of yours, hath written a Commentarie on the booke of Iosua: in the which he launceth your authenticall Latin, almost in euerie Chapter: yea, 
                     S. Andr. Mas. cō
                        mentar. in Iosu. cap. 14. ver. 15. he saith that S. Jerom, (if hee be the Authour of it) doeth seeme to haue translated 
                  
                     Sciens.
                   
                  wittingly a place against the meaning of the Hebrue, that he might vouch a fansy of his owne thereby. Yet 
                     Ioh. Molanus Louaniensis.
                   the Popish Censour, who allowed it to the print, witnesseth of that Commentarie that 
                     Multúm elucidat veterem & vulgatam editionem.
                   
                  it lighteneth and openeth the common olde translation greatly. Let vs doe much lesse, let vs but raze the credite of it: and will you giue that Censure of vs? Nay, if wée do note that 
                     Gen. 8.21. where your old translation hath of the frame or imagination of mans hart, that it is

                     Hebr. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Wherefore in that I saide that if we should goe from your authenticall Latin to the originall textes, it would be misliked of: I doo you no iniurie. Yet I mislike it not in your plea for Peter, that you take aduantage not of the originall, but of a translation: nay, I like it well. Though I like not that which you adde to proue it: that

                  , and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

But, that Christ did meane a stone, not a rocke, in naming him Cephas: your stoutest champion, D. Sanders, may serue in stéed of many witnesses. For he, wanting no will to go as far as the boldest, and hauing many yeares aduised of the matter, durst say no more for Cephas, but 1. De visib.

In the which iudgement he doeth deserue the greater credite at your handes, because he was contented to hazard his life with the Pope against his Prince in that As him selfe termeth it in his letters written to Vllick Burck an Irish Gentleman. 
                  holy quarell: and hauing spent his chiefest studie in the point In his booke entitled, the rocke of the church.
                   he had before times expounded it a rocke; the which exposition so fit for the Papacy he would haue neuer left, had not the truth enforced him to retire from it. A thing so much the likelier, because when hee laboured first to infect men with the Popes supremacie by the name of rocke, and therfore both in the title and course of all his booke did sound the rocke of the church: euen then In the chap. 1. he did expound Cephas and Peter doubtfully, a rocke, or a stone; and yelding the reason why Christ did name him so, he mentioned a stone onely, because what place a stone hath in holding vp the house

which is built vpon it, the same should Peter haue in vpholding the frame of Christes militant church. Wherefore you must let go your holde of the rocke, (whereon 
                     Princ. doctrin. lib. 6. cap. 5. D. Stapleton doth beast your house is built) and be content to lay a stone in stéed of it. Let our Sauiour Christ alone be the rocke. If you dash your selfe against him therein, he will breake you in péeces.

               It is a disputable point. You sée that learned men are of sundrie iudgements in expounding of it: some thinking, it betokeneth a stone, some a rocke. Wherefore you can not force me to take the one and leaue the other.

               This I do conclude, that séeing the church was built vpon Peter, and the Apostles themselues were part of the Church: therefore the Apostles were built vpon him; and so was he their foundation. By consequent whereof, séeing the foundation is the same to a house which a head is to a bodie: I do conclude againe that Peter was the head of all the Apostles. And so my purpose is proued.

               This conclusion hath neither foundation, nor head. For by as good reason you may conclude also, that, séeing the Church was built vpon Peter, and Peter him selfe is a part of the church: therefore was Peter built vpon him selfe, and so was he his own foundatiō. And because a foundation is the same to a house, which a head is to a bodie: therefore S. Peter was S. Peters head. Or, if you sée not either the necessitie or folly of this consequence, as it is made of Peter: you may frame the lyke of any other of the Apostles, and you will espy it.

                  the wall had twelue foundations, and in them the names of the Lambs twelue Apostles. Then séeing that the church was built vpon euerie one of those twelue, as vpon Iames by name, and Peter was a part of the church: it foloweth that Peter was built vpon Iames; and so was Iames his foundation. And séeing a foundation is the same to a house, which a head is to a bodie: it followeth againe that Iames was Peters head. which if your self denie: you must denie that wherof it doth folow by force of like reason. And so your purpose is not proued.
            
            
               Hart.
               But we do imagine, that in this building of the church

and laying the foundations of it, Christ did laie Peter next vpon himselfe (as the foundation of the rest) and other Apostles vpon him.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Indéede you doo imagin it. And you consider not that your imagination is crossed by it selfe, not onelye by the truth. For, if the twelue Apostles of the Lambe (on whom hee built his church) were laid as twelue foundations, one vpon an other, & Peter lowest of them: then, as Peter was foundation of eleuen, so the next to him must be of ten, the next to him of nine, and likewise ech of the next, vntill the last of none. A thing flatte repugnant to your imagination, wherein you make Peter (onely) head of the rest, the rest of them equall all amongst themselues. Neither doth it stand with that proportion of the building which the scripture maketh, reseruing the prerogatiue of 1. Cor. 3.11. 
                  the onely singular foundation to Christ, and ioyning the Apostles all in equall honour of 
                     Reu. 21.14. 
                  the twelue foundations, as I haue shewed. For Christ (in this house) is as it were 
                     Mat. 7.24. 
                  a rocke, a rockie sure and firme ground, on which both the Apostles, and all his church is built: as 2. Sam. 5.9. the citie of Dauid was on the mount Sion. The Apostles are as stones, as twelue most pretious stones, which being laid ioyntlie one by an other, all on Christ, are as twelue foundations: and walles (of chosen stones) are raysed vp on them, 2. Pet. 3.9. vntill the whole number of the elect be laid on, and the building finished. One of these foundations might excell an other in pretiousnes of graces. For, the first foundation, (saith 
                     Reu. 21.19. 
                  Iohn) was a Iasper; the second, a Sapphire; the third, a Chalcedonie; the fourth, an Emeraude; and so forth the rest. Or (because I know not the vertues of these stones) 
                     Marc. 13.1. 
                  the stones, which the Disciples of Christ did meruaile at in the temple of Ierusalem for the fairenes and greatnes of them, were (as 
                     Antiquitat. Iudaic. lib. 15. cap. 14. 
                  Iosephus writeth) fiue and twentie cubites long, eight cubites hie, and twelue cubites broad. Now as among such stones one might be fairer or better wrought then other: so might one Apostle of Christ excell his felowes in zeale or other giftes, as namelie S. Peter. Unlesse perhaps S. Paul, whom Christ did adde to the twelue, excelled both him and them: which I do thinke rather; for 1. Cor. 15.10. he labored more then they all, and (by 
                     Staplet. princ. doc

                        . l. 6. c. 12. your owne confession) conuerted more vnto the faith. But neither Paule nor Peter were foundations of the rest: they were altogither

ioint-foundations of the church, laid on Christ, the onely and singular foundation, to speake of a foundation properly. UUherefore though our Sauiour in saying to Peter, Thou art stone, and vpon this stone will I build my church, had meant that he would build it vpon Peters person (which serueth best your fansy:) yet doth not that saying inferre a supreme-headship. But doubtles (if your fansy can yéeld vnto the truth) he meant not Peters person, but his faith, and function in preaching of the faith. For the onely person that the church is built on, as on a foundation (by the strength and vertue whereof it is vpholden) is the sonne of God, our Sauiour Iesus Christ: beside whom 1. Cor. 3.11. 
                  no other foundation may be laid: 
                  
                     Eph. 2.21. 
                  in whom all the building being coupled togither groweth vnto an holy temple in the Lord. Now because that faith in the sonne of God doth make the liuing stones whereof the building is compact and knitte vp on Christ, a stone of which sort 
                     Mat. 16.16. 
                  Peter had shewed himselfe to be Thou art Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God. by beleeuing and professing that faith: Christ told him that he was (according to his name, stone) a stone indeede; and hauing chosen him to preach the same faith, whereby there shoulde be laide more stones on that building, hee saide, vpon this stone will I build my church. UUherin as he shewed that whosoeuer should be members of his church must be members of it by felowship with Peters faith: so he shewed withall that hee would impart that faith to his church by the ministerie of Peter. As appeareth farther by that which he added, To thee will I giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Yet euen this doth argue still the same prerogatiue which we giue to Peter. For séeing Christ said that he woulde build his Church vpon that stone, or rocke, (as I take it) and that, which a church is builded vpon, must needes be a foundation; it foloweth that Peter was a foundation of the church. Not a principall foundation, for that is Christ onely, of whom it is true that 1. Cor. 3.

                  other foundation no man can laye beside that which is laid, which is Christ Iesus: but (as wee terme it) a ministeriall foundation. UUhich, by the proportion of a foundation to a house and a head to a bodie, is enough to proue that Christ would make Peter head of the Apostles, I meane a ministeriall head.

               But here againe you fal into your former fault:

and that which was common to all the Apostles by the meaning of Christ, you chalenge as proper vnto Peter onely. For, as the confession of Peter touching Christ shewed their common faith by the mouth of one: so the answere of Christ directed vnto one conteined that blessing that should be common to them all. And this is declared by the holy scripture: which to the Ephesians (mē
                  bers of the church) saith, that 
                     Ephe. 2.20. 
                  they are built vpō the foundatiō of the Apostles & Prophets. Not of Peter onely, but of the Apostles; who lay the same foundation (all) that Peter did, and thereupon are called (all of them) 
                     Reu. 21.14. 
                  foundations. And the church relying vpon their doctrine, that is the Christian faith, (the onely and sure foundatiō of the church, as the truth hath forced In the Councell of Trent, which (Session.

Wherfore by the proportion (that you grate vpon) of a foundation to a house, and a head to a bodie: as Christ is head onely, so is he the onely foundation of the Church; as the name of foundation is giuen to the Apostles, so the twelue foundations doth proue them twelue heads. You must séeke therefore some other foundation of Peters headship ouer them. For neither the name of stone that Christ gaue him, nor the wordes of building his church vpon that stone, proue that he promised him to make him head of all the Apostles.

                  Not in your iudgement: but in mine they doo. And so dooth the other part of the promise also which Christ made vnto him; 
                     Mat. 16.19. 
                  To thee will I giue the keyes of the kingdome of heuen.

               These keyes will not open more in the house, then did the foundation lay in the building. For if you meane by fulnes of ecclesiasticall power, the lawfull power of the Apostleship, then the which no greater was euer giuen to anie ministers of the church: Christ gaue it both to Peter and to euerie Apostle. If you meane such power as the Pope claimeth by

                  soueraine power not onely spirituall but

But what soeuer you meane by fulnes of power: this is cleere and certaine that our Sauiour promised no more power to Peter, then he meant and performed to all the Apostles. And therefore, what soeuer he promised to him, he promised in him to them. For, as amongst them, when they were all asked, 
                     Mat. 16. ver. 15. 
                  Whom say ye that I am, Peter answered alone, 
                     ver. 16. 
                  Thou art Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God: so Christ said to him alone, 
                     ver. 19. 
                  I will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, as though he had alone receaued power to bind and loose: whereas he made that answere one in stead of them all; and receiued this power, one togither with them all. Wherefore sith no more was promised then giuen, and equall power was giuen to all the Apostles: this promise proueth not your headship. You must bring vs foorth some better euidence: or else your title will be naught.

               The euidence is good. For it saith in plaine and expresse termes, that Christ would giue the keyes to Peter. Then the which what could be more manifestly spoken?

But so, that I graunt the same (in like maner) of other sacramentall and mysticall spéeches: wherein the scriptures giue the name of the thing to that which it betokneth, as of 
                     Matt. 26.17. Exo. 12. vers. 11. & 27. 
                  the passeouer, to the lambe, and of 1. Cor. 10.4. and the rocke was Christ. 
                  the rocke to Christ. For (I hope) you wil not conclude of this shew, that really Christ was a rocke; or a lambe, the passeouer really.
            
            
               
               Hart.
               These spéeches are not like to that of Christes bodie in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. For, it is manifest, that when the lambe was called the passeouer, and Christ the rocke: it was meant, not really, but figuratiuely, that the rocke signified Christ; the lambe, the passeouer. But it is not manifest in that of Christes bodie.

               Whither it be manifest, or no; is not the question: but whither the spéeches be like in shew of wordes, the rocke was Christ, this is my bodie. Or, to come néerer to your owne example and proofe of that point: Christ saith of himselfe that

Yet if you say that Christ is bread, really; and his flesh, meate; and his blood, drinke: you may as well say, that he is really

               Nay, we doo confesse that many things in scripture are spoken and meant figuratiuely: but neither all, nor this concerning the Sacrament, nor any thing els, whereof the literall and proper sense hath not somewhat contrarie to God, to religion, and to Christian life. As 
                     Alan. de sacrament. Eucharist. cap. 22. D. Allen saith that S. 
                  
                     De Genes. ad lit. lib. 8. cap. 2. De doctr. Christ. lib. 3. cap. 15. 
                  Austin teacheth. Out of 
                     cap. 10. whom he citeth withall a woorthie sentence, touching such, as you are: If the minde be preuented with an opinion of some errour, whatsoeuer the scripture dooth affirme otherwise, men thinke it to be spoken figuratiuely.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               That sentence is good, as S. Austin vttereth it. But D. Allen vseth it ill, against vs. The woorse, because S. Austin sheweth straight vpon it, 
                     cap. 16. in the same booke, of the same point, that, to eate the flesh of Christ, and drinke his blood, was spoken not properly (for so it were a wicked deede,) but figuratiuely: flat against that error of the reall presence, which hée is pretended to proue by D. Allen. But howsoeuer D. Allen deale in that: the point (which you graunt with him) sufficeth me for proofe of that I saide. For if many things in scripture are spoken and meant figuratiuely: it followeth that the sense of scripture is against the shew of wordes in sundrie places, and therfore that the shew of words sundrie times is against the truth. Which sith you cannot sée in this Sacrament, because of your preiudice of the

reall presence: I will bring an example of the sacrament of baptisme, wherein you must needes sée it. There were

                   some of old, who, as we sprinckle children with water in baptizing of them, so they vsed to print and stampe certaine marks vpon them with fire. For the which vsage they alleaged the scripture, (I meane, the wordes thereof) that, touching Iohn Baptist: 
                  
                     Luc. 3.16. who saying of himselfe, I baptize you with water, addeth of our Sauiour, He will baptize you with the holie Ghost and fire. Now, I put the matter to your owne iudgement, whether they did better, who baptized with fire: or we, who without it.
            
            
               Hart.
               Who doubteth, but we? For they were deceiued who tooke the name of fire properly in that place: where it is vsed figuratiuely, to signifie the graces of the holie Ghost, who lighteneth and purgeth the hartes of the faithfull. They, who did baptize in that sort, were heretikes: as

               Yet the shew of words dooth make more for thē: Iohn baptized with water, Christ baptizeth with fire. Neither haue you here so much as that euasion, (which yet if you had, were nothing to the purpose) that it is manifest to be meant, not properly, but figuratiuely. For there haue béene

And your reall presence hath not gone so far in the one Sacrament with this is my bodie: as their firie markes haue gone in the other with the holie Ghost and fire. Wherefore (to returne to the point in questiō) although it may séeme by the shew of words that our Sauiour promised the keyes of the kingdome of heauen to Peter onely: yet, sith he meant them to all the Apostles (as I haue declared) your claime will be a bare shew, if all your proofe be shew of wordes. And therefore, as I said, so I say againe, that you must bring vs foorth some better euidence: or els your title will be naught.

               Which all the Fathers make? We had néede to haue bodies like the bodies of Oakes, and memories as strong as stéele, to endure to reade, and be sure to remember of euery exposition, so much, as may ascertaine vs, that all the Fathers make it. Hath any man liuing read them all? Nay, haue all the men liuing read them? Nay, can they shewe them? Can they get them? I had almost said, can they name them?
            
            
               Hart.
               Womeane of the Fathers which are extant commonly, and may be had and read. If many of them make it, and the rest either gainsay it not, or say nought of it: we count it to bée made of all with one consent.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               That count is euill cast. For, as in the writings of Fathers which we haue, some one expoundeth places of Scripture oftentimes otherwise then all the rest, 
                     Sixt. Senen. biblioth. sanct. li. 5. & 6. Aloys. Lipom. caten. in Genes. & Exod.
                   (a thing notorious and confessed:) so, it is likely that in those which we haue not some places were otherwise expounded thē they be in those which we haue. Yet I will not deny but you had reason so to count. For else your lawier had béene dumbe, and could not haue spoken a word for his client. But if this be your rule of the churches exposition: then I could haue made mine exposition, the churches, with a wet finger, if I would haue stuffed it with the names of Fathers. For my words of Peter, that he alone made answere for all the Apostles, & receiued the keyes togither with them all, are the wordes of 
                     In Iohan. tractat. 118. 
                  S. Austin, though I did not name him. And 
                     In Psal. 38. 
                  S. Ambrose saith of that promise of Christ (I will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and the rest which followeth) that what is said to Peter, is said to the Apostles. And 
                     Aduers. Iouinian. lib. 1. 
                  Ierom saith, that the foundation and firmenesse of the church lay on all the Apostles equally, and they did all receiue the keyes. And 
                     In Matth. tractat. 1. 
                  Origen saith, that Christes promise of building his church, of giuing the keyes, of binding and loosing, made as to Peter onely, was common vnto all. And 
                     De Trinitat. lib. 6. 
                  Hilarie saith in like sort, that through the worthinesse of their faith they obtained

the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and the power of binding and loosing in heauen and earth. Neither doo I doubt but other of the Fathers haue said as much as these in the expounding of these words. But haue they or not: this is no path for vs to walke in, if we séeke the right way. For neither might we hope for an ende of our trauels because of sundrie expositions, one contrarie to an other: and we should faint for thirst in time of heate and drouth, looking for water in the wildernesse, as 
                     Iob. 6.19. the trauellers of Tema: and (that is woorst of all) sometimes wee should leaue the pure water of truth, and swill vp puddle in stéed of it. For, although the Fathers were men indued of God with excellent gifts, and brought no small light to vnderstanding of the scriptures: yet learned men in our dayes may giue a right sense of sundrie places thereof which the Fathers saw not, yea against the which perhaps they consent.

Cyprian in expounding a certaine place of Scripture, afterward did finde in Tyconius the Donatist an other exposition: which thinking to be truer, he preferred it before Cyprians. Whereby you may sée, that, although you thought as yll of Caluin and Beza, as did S. Austin of the Donatists, yet, if you had S. Austins minde, you would rather follow the sense which they giue sometimes of the scriptures, then that which is giuen by auncient godly Fathers. Neuerthelesse, my minde was not of them, when I mentioned learned men. For, to what purpose? Sith I am not ignorant how small account you make of them.

of the scriptures vnto the senses of the Fathers. UUherefore if he fall vpon a new sense agreeable to the text,

                  D. Payua Andradius, rebuketh this your Bishops reproofe, as more rash: yea defendeth Caietan against it as a slander. He teacheth first, that the Fathers doo in many places not expound the Scriptures according to the literall sense, (the onely which hath weight to proue pointes of faith,) but allegorically and morally. We may leaue their allegories and expound them literally. He teacheth next, that when they seeke the literall senses of the scriptures, they doo not alwaies finde them, but giue diuers senses one vnlike an other. We may forsake their senses all, and bring a new vnlike to theirs. Moreouer, (to make the thing euident by examples) him selfe expoundeth sundry places otherwise then the Fathers haue: declaring that hée doth it vpon sufficient ground. Againe, he proueth by the sayings of the chiefe of the Fathers, that they spake not oracles whē they expounded the Scriptures, but might therein be deceiued. He sheweth furthermore, that the ouersightes of the translatiō which they followed, must cause them needes to misse sometimes the right meaning of the holie Ghost. Finally, he addeth that experience forceth vs to confesse (vnlesse we will be vnthankfull to most excellent wittes) that verie manie things in Moses and the Prophets are in this our age expounded more exactly (through the diligence of learned men) then euer they were before. Whereupon he concludeth that the holy Ghost, the onely and faithfull interpreter of the Scriptures, would haue manie things to be knowne to vs, which our auncestors knew not: and hath wrought by meanes, (vnknowne to vs, knowne to him) that the Fathers noted good and godlie mysteries out of verie manie places of the Scriptures, whereof the right and naturall sense hath beene found out by the posteritie. This is, in few words, the iudgement of Andradius, which he prosecuteth

more at large; in the defense of Cardinall Caietan against quarellers; who did cauill at him because he wrote that it is lawfull to go against the streame of the auncient Fathers in expounding of the Scriptures.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               I care not for the iudgement of Andradius, or Caietan, or any other priuate man, though you could bring a hundred of them. I doo not build my faith on them.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Although you care not for their iudgement, yet you should care for their reasons. Of which the light is so great: that, vnlesse a man haue altogether lost his eyes, he can not choose but see the truth and brightnesse of them. Neither may you set so litle by their iudgement: chiefly the iudgement of Andradius. If you doo: it may be the price of his contempt will helpe to purchase your confusiō.

But let the Authours, with their reasons, be proofes of no value: and grant, that if the Fathers all consent in one, their exposition must be stood too.

Thus vnder the colour of one Fathers iudgement against all the rest, you conceale the second commandement from the people, least your vile idolatrie, or

So that, through omitting the second commaundement, as part annexed to the first: Clemens found no more commandements then nine, whereas 
                     Exod. 34.28. the scriptures number ten. UUherefore, either Clemens maketh nothing for you: or at least no more for you then vs.
            
            
               Hart.
               Yes. For the later place of sixe commaundementes, wherein Clemens maketh for you, is corrupted. The former is sound, wherein he maketh for vs.

                   hath corrupted Clemens in the chiefe place that he doth make for vs against you. Which I say, not (as father Robert doth) vpon my word without proofe: but the verie drift and course of Clemens treatise, and

As for the repugnancie that is betwéene these pointes in the true copie of Clemens: it séemeth not to haue growne of either place corrupted, but of an ouersight & slippe of memorie in Clemens, by reason of a digression which he fell into vpon occasion of the precept to sanctifie the Sabbath day. And this is the likelier, because there is some bodie touched by 
                     In Exod. homil. 8. 
                  Origen for so diuiding the commandements: and we find not anie that hath diuided them so before Clemens; who was Origens maister. Which also father Robert himselfe hath obserued. Wherefore you may not looke for anie helpe at the hands of Clemens: S. Austin you must stand alone with, and folow one against all.

                  S. Austin replyed, that peraduenture hee might finde as manie Fathers on his side, if he had read much. But I, saith he, haue Paule the Apostle himselfe in stead of these all, and aboue these all. To him do I flie, to him I appeale from all the Doctors (his interpreters) who are of other mindes. Of him do I aske, whereas he writeth to the Galatians, that hee sawe Peter not going with a ryght foote to the truth of the Gospell, and that hee withstood him to his face for it, bicause by that dissembling hee constrayned the Gentiles to doo lyke the Iewes: whether he wrote true, or did lye perhaps

                  with I know not what politike falshood. And I do heare him (a litle before) making a very religious protestation, in the beginning of the same discourse, The thynges whych I write vnto you, beholde, I witnes before God, I lye not. Let them, who are of other mindes, pardon me. I beleeue rather so great an Apostle, swearing in his owne and for his owne words, then anie man be he neuer so learned, talking of the words of an other. A wise and frée iudgement, worthie of S. Austin. Whereby you may perceiue that your rule of folowing the greater number of the Fathers in expounding the scriptures, is but a leaden rule, not fitte which should be vsed to square out stones by, for building of the Lords temple.
            
            
               Hart.
               This of Austin sheweth that we may vary sometimes from the greater number of the Fathers, and refuse their iudgement. But that (as 
                     Confess. Augustin. lib. 1. cap. 11. tit. 1. 
                  Torrensis hath obserued well) must bee with two cautions. One, that the thing wherein we varie from them be a knowne truth. The other, that we do it with reuerence and modestie.

                  way to know it, and that a good way,

               This bringeth vs small helpe to the expounding of scriptures. For things may be true: and yet a place of scripture not applied truely and rightly to proue them. As it is plaine in places,

                   as it is noted on your law. But here the former difficulties méete vs againe, and bréede the same perplexitie. For there are but few places of Scripture which generall Councels haue expounded: neither is it likely the Pope will assemble them to expound the rest. Againe, although 
                     Staplet. princip. doctrin. li. 8. cap. 14. & 15. lib. 11. cap. 6. you say that generall Councels can not erre in their conclusions: yet you say they may erre in applying of Scriptures to prooue their conclusions. Lastly, generall Councels may dissent too: 
                     Concil. Eph. 2. & Concil. Chalcedon.
                   as heretofore they haue in a weightie point offaith touching Christ. The which incommodities being all incident into this which presently we debate of, as our conference will shew: you sée that you haue not yet resolued me. One question I must aske you more. In this case, when Councels say nothing of Scriptures; or misapply them, in proofes; or dissent, in conclusions: what are we to doo?

               If Councels dissent, we must follow those which are confirmed by the Head.

               Doo you not sée then by your owne answeres, that whatsoeuer shew you make of Fathers and Councels: the Pope is the man that must strike the stroke? So that, (to bring it to the point in controuersie) whereas our question is, whether that the Pope be supreme head of the church: you say, He is so. UUhen we sift the matter, and séeke the reasons, why: this is the summe of all, Because him selfe saith so. I thought, that

                  the church should haue béene your lawier to expounde your euidences: but now I perceiue that you meant the Pope. Hée is the churches husband (belike) and in matters of law dealeth for her. I cannot blame you, though you be content to make him your iudge too. For if he giue sentence, in this cause, against you: I will neuer trust him.

               I doo gather nothing, but that which you haue scattered. For, you began to try this point touching the Pope by the wordes of Scripture. The wordes (we agrée) decide by ye sense: ye sense must be tried (you say) by ye Fathers: the Fathers by ye truth: the truth by the people: the people by the Councels: the Councels by the Pope.

               Howsoeuer you dally with your circulations, & rounds, as you call them: I say no more, but this, that if a truth cannot be knowne otherwise, then the last meane to resolue vs of it, is the Popes authoritie. But there néeded not so much adoo hereof, if I proue that Christ did giue that supremacie (whereof we talked) to S. Peter.

                     Col. 3.16. 
                  the word of Christ, which is the holie scripture. And the scripture standeth in substance of the sense, not in the shew of wordes. UUherefore, it was néedfull, sith we séeke herein to finde out Christes will, that first we agreed what way the right sense of the scripture may be knowne. UUhich, séeing you would haue me to fetch from the Pope, and I haue no lust to go vnto Rome, nor thinke it lodgeth in The Palace of the Pope. the Vatican, so yt by this way no agréement can be made, or ende of controuersie hoped for: I will take a shorter and a surer way, confessed by vs both to be a good way, whereby the right sense of the scripture may be found, and so the will of Christ be knowne.

               Rainoldes.
               To learne of Christ him selfe the meaning of his

word, and let his spirit teach it: that is, to expound the scripture by the scripture. A golden rule, to know, and try the truth from errour: prescribed by the Lord, and practised by his seruants for the building of his church from age to age through all posteritie. For, 2. Pet. 1. ver. 19. the holie Ghost, exhorting the Iewes, to compare the darker light of the Prophetes with the cléerer of the Apostles, that the day-brigtnesse of the Sonne of righteousnes may shine in their hartes: saith, that 
                     ver. 20. 
                  no prophecy of Scripture is of a mans owne interpretation: because, in the prophecie (that is, the scripture of the Prophetes) they spake as they were moued by the holie Ghost, not as the will of man did fansie. UUhich reason sith it implieth, as the Prophetes, so the Apostles: and it is true in them all, the holie men of God, spake as they were moued by the holie Ghost: it followeth that all the scripture ought to be expounded by God, because 2. Tim. 3.16. it is inspired of God: as 
                     L. Si. Cod. De legib. et constitutionib. Principum.
                   natures light hath taught that he who made the law, should interpret the law. This rule commended to vs by the prescript of God, and as it were sanctified by

UUherefore, if you desire in déede the churches exposition, and would so faine finde it: you must go this way, this is the churches way: that is the churches sense to which this way dooth bring you. For, S. Austin,

Austin hath written foure bookes of Christian doctrine, wherein he purposely entreateth, how men should vnderstand the Scripture and expound it. The summe of all his treatise doth aime at this marke, which I haue pointed too: that the meaning of the Scripture must be learned out of the Scripture,

                     cap. 28. 
                  if a sense be giuen, the vncertaintie wherof cannot bee discussed by certaine and sure testimonies of scripture, it might be proued by reason; but this custome is dangerous; the safer way far, is, to walke by the scripture, the which (being shadowed with darke and borowed words) when we mind to search, let either that come out of it which hath no doubt and controuersie, or, if it haue doubt, let it be determined by the same scripture, through witnesses to be found & vsed thence wheresoeuer: yt

               I graunt, it neither can, nor ought to be denyed, that

euery one of those things, and specially, if they be ioined all togither, doo helpe very much to vnderstand the scriptures rightly. But

                     . yet they are not so sure and certaine meanes as some other are, which we preferre before them. Neither do they helpe alwaies; nay, sometimes they do hurt rather, and deceiue greatlie such as expound the Scripture after them. This is not onelye said, but also proued at large out of the Doctors and Fathers, by that worthie man of great wit and iudgement, our countriman M. Stapleton Doctor of Diuinitie, the Kinges Professor of controuersies in the vniuersitie of Doway. Of whose most wholesome worke, entitled, A methodicall demonstration of doctrinall principles of the faith: one booke is wholly spent to shew the meanes, way and order, how to make authenticall interpretation of the Scriptures. In the which hee layeth this for a ground, that 
                     Staplet. princ. doctr. lib. 11. c. 1. 
                  the Scripture cannot be rightly vnderstood but by the rule of faith. Whereupon 
                     cap. 2. he condemneth the Protestantes opinion, that the sense of Scriptures must be fetched out of the Scriptures. Which errour of yours to ouerthrow the more fully: he deliuereth foure meanes of expounding the Scriptures; 
                     cap. 3. the first, very certaine and sure, the rule of faith; 
                     cap. 4. the next, no lesse certaine, the practise of the church; 
                     cap. 5. the third, at least probable, the consent of the Fathers;

                  these meanes, he saith, are the onely certaine sure infallible meanes, of vnderstanding and expounding the Scripture aright. As for other meanes, which learned men do vse, such as you obserued out of S. Austin: he graunteth they are profitable, but deceitfull many waies, if ech of them be seuerally taken by it selfe. Which he proueth in particular by the chiefest of them: first, the weighing of circumstances, what goeth before, what commeth after; next, the wordes and kinde of speeches vsed in the Scriptures; thirdly, 
                     cap. 10.

                     cap. 9. 
                  common to vs with all Heretikes, yea with Iewes and Painims; (who do all, conferre places, obserue the kinde of spéeches, looke on the Gréeke and

Hebrue fountaines, marke what goeth before, what commeth after, and such like thinges; and yet they are verye farre from the true vnderstanding of the scriptures;) I will my selfe practise it when I shall see good: but there is no reason of yours that can enforce me to allow it simply.

               The treatise of your Doctor against the Protestants opinion, is like the army of Antiochus prepared against the Romans: verie great and huge of men of many nations, but white liuered souldiours: neither so strong with armour, as glistering with gold and siluer. Antiochus him selfe was amazed at it, and thought it vnuincible: so did the simple fooles of his country too. But 
                     Liui. lib. 37. the Romans contemned it: and 
                     Plutarch. in compar. Scipio. & Annib.
                   
                  Annibal iested at it. The name of Protestants, (which 
                     Staplet. princip. doctr. lib. 7. cap. 15. & li. 11. cap. 10. he vseth tauntingly as all one with Heretikes) wée are no more ashamed of, then were the 2. Chron. 24.19.

                     Act. 2.40. & 8.25. & 10.42.

The Protestants opinion, I haue alreadie shewed to be the opinion of the auncient Protestants, the Fathers, the Apostles, the holie Ghost who spake by them. If you call it an errour: we are content to erre with them. If he thinke it an heresie: we are no better then Paul, 
                  
                     Act. 24.14. & 26.22. who in such heresie serued God. The ground which 
                     Stapl. princip. doctr. li. 11. ca. 1. & 2. he layeth for the disproofe of it: is such, that it séemeth, his wits and he had made a fray when he layed it. He saith, that the scripture ought to be expounded by the rule of faith, and therfore not by scripture onely. Which is (in effect) as if a man should say: the church must be taught by liuing creatures endued with reason, and therefore not by men onely. For as a liuing creature endued with reason, and a man, is all one, which euerie childe knoweth by the principles of logicke: so the rule of faith, and scripture is all one, doth not your Doctor know it? It is a principle of diuinitie, deliuered by S. Austin, whom 
                     cap. 3. he pretendeth (chiefly, in this point) to follow.

               And doth he not follow him? Doth he not alleage S. Austins owne wordes, 
                     August. de doctr. Christ. li. 3. cap. 2. 
                  In a doubtfull place of scripture let a man seeke the rule of faith, which rule hee hath learned of plainer places of the scriptures, and of the authoritie of the church: to proue that the rule of faith must be fetched out of the

authoritie of the church also, not out of scriptures onely?

               Yes: he doth alleage S. Austins wordes in déed: but as 
                     Mat. 26.61. the false witnesses alleaged Christes wordes of destroying the temple, and building it in three dayes: the wordes, against the meaning. Which tricke

                   the law noteth as an abusing of the lawe: yet is it common with your Doctor. For as Christ, when he spake of raising the temple, by the temple 
                  
                     Ioh. 2.19. meant his bodie, the witnesses did wrest it to the temple of Ierusalem: so, the authoritie of the church is mentioned by S. Austin, as teaching scriptures onely, your Doctor alleageth it, as teaching somewhat beside the scriptures.
            
            
               Hart.
               This is strange, that S. Austin, by, the authoritie of the church, meant no more then by the plainer places of the scriptures. For so much you séeme to say in effect.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Be it strange: yet is it true. For him selfe declareth that to be his meaning, not onely by the rest of his whole treatise, wherein he doth establish the scriptures alone for the rule of faith, to shew the sense of doubtfuller places by the plainer: but also by the ende of this your owne sentence, which Stapleton (in alleaging it) either negligently passed, or craftily suppressed: vnlesse the fault perhaps be in some other, with whose eyes he read it. For 
                     Aug. de doctr. Christian. lib. 3. cap. 2. after these wordes, let him seeke the rule of faith, which rule he hath learned of plainer places of the scriptures, and of the authoritie of the church: it followeth in S. Austin, Of which rule we haue sufficiently entreated in the first booke, when we spake of thinges. Now, in that discourse (to which he referreth vs) he spake not of any thing as taught by the church, but what is in the scripture. Wherefore, in these wordes, by the authoritie of the church, he meant not any thing beside the scripture. If he did: shew it. If he did not: acknowledge it.
            
            
               Hart.

defending it: S. Austin replieth, that as he had termed the Father vnbegotten, & well, although the word not written: so might the Sonne also be termed consubstantiall; sith the scripture proueth the thing meant therby. And as with this Arian: so wt their bishop Maximinus.

                     lib. 3. cap. 3. & 10. 
                  Austin answereth, that although it be not written in flat termes, yet is it gathered by necessarie consequence of that which is written, 
                     Matt. 4.10. 
                  Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, 
                  1. Cor. 3.16. & 6.19. 
                  the holy Ghost is God, therefore to bee worshipped. Thus, S. Austins meaning was of these pointes, that the scripture teacheth them. Whereby you may perceiue the fraude of Torrensis. Who saying that they are not expresly written in the scriptures, left him selfe this refuge, that hee might say they are not in expresse wordes, though for sense and substance they are in the scriptures. And yet, by referring 
                     Tit. 4. cap. 8. de tradit.

A doctrine, which Arians will clappe their handes at: that the Sonne of God is not (by scripture) of one substance with the Father. But let it be far from you, M. Hart, to thinke so prophanely of the word of God. And, if you rest so much on Doctors of your owne side, rest here on

                     lib. 3. c. 2. 
                  the authoritie of the church, more then he signified by plainer places of the scriptures.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Yes: his own words in that verie sentence doo yéeld sufficient proofe (me thinkes) that he did. For, if he signified by plainer

places of the scriptures, as much as he meant by the authoritie of the church then was it idle, when he had named the one, to adde the other to it: chiefly in such sort, as that is added by S. Austin. For both the coniunction, the places of scriptures, and the authoritie of the church, should import thinges different: and I may say of wordes, as the Philosopher saith of things, That is done in vaine by more that may be done by fewer.

               Nothing is done in vaine, that is done to edifie. The church might well be mentioned, as an interpreter of the worde: though it teach not any thing beside the word of God. The people of Israel 
                  
                     Exod, 14.31. 
                  did beleeue the Lord and his seruaunt Moses: yet Moses did nothing but that the Lorde commaunded him. The wise man doth charge his sonne 
                     Prou. 1.8. 
                  to hearken to the instruction of his father, and forsake not the doctrine of his mother: yet they both (the father, and mother) teach one lesson, the chiefest wisedome, the feare of God. The same is fulfilled in this Moses, and the Lord; or rather in this mother, and our heauenly Father: of whom it hath bene said well,

                  He cannot haue God to be his Father, who hath not the church to be his mother. For, God hauing purposed to make vs his children and heires of life eternall, as he prepared his word, to be, first, the séede, 1. Pet. 1.23.

                  the sincere milke, whereby wee (béeing borne) grow: so he ordeined the church by her ministerie to teach it, as it were a mother, first, to conceaue and bring foorth ye children, afterward to nourish them, as babes new borne, with her milke. Which appeareth, as by Namely, by Philip, Act. 8.

Now, the milke which the church giueth to her children, shée giueth it out of her brestes: and her two brestes, are the two testaments of the holie scriptures (by S.

               Hart.
               Not for milke perhaps, which babes are to sucke: but

for strong meate wherewith men are nourished. For mothers féede not their children, being growne, with mylke out of theyr brestes.

               But S. Austin addeth that the holy scriptures haue both milke for babes, and strong meat for men: milke, in plainer thinges and easier to be vnderstood; strong meate, in harder and greater mysteries. Yea, where

Which the light of reason will induce you too, if you beléeue the former pointes. For the

Then, if we are begotten of Gods worde, as seede: the word, as it is milke to nourish vs, when we are young; so must it nourish vs, when we are grown, as strong meat. But if it were so, that S. Austin had not had this opinion touching strong meat: yet must he néedes haue it, in that whereof we reason: for there he speaketh of milke. And he sayth that the rule of faith is receiued of plainer places of the scriptures and of the authoritie of the church: to note the churches practise,

So that the simplest Christians, who had not read them selues the plainer places of the scriptures to learne the rule of faith, yet knewe it by the catechisme: wherin, through the ministery of the church, they learned it. Now, S. Austins catechisme hath nothing but the doctrine which Christians may sucke out of plainer places of the scriptures. His rule of faith therefore deliuered in the plainer places of the scriptures, is the same that the authoritye of the church deliuered. In déede your

For Austin, in saying, the rule of faith is learned of plainer places of the Scriptures and of the authoritie of the church: named the Scriptures, as the matter, the church as the minister, wherof the rule of faith is learned. Your Doctor, supposing, as wel the carpenter, as the timber, to be the stuffe, whereof the house must be builded; doth laye his axe to both togither: and squaring them alike, doth make him beames, and postes, and iuises, some of the timber, some of the carpenter. Euen so, the holy scripture is not the whole matter of the rule of faith: whereof the church ministers, as workemen, and builders, should frame the house of God: but in part, the church; in part, the scripture is the matter.

For, as you take the name of Pope for supreme head, and supreme head for that power which you haue defined: there was no Pope at all, when we receiued the faith. The bratte was not yet borne, when Gregory the first, much lesse, when Eleutherius was Bishop of Rome: as our cōnference will shew. Thirdly, if they who were the predecessours of the Pope (though not as Pope) gaue vs our first faith: the successors can not complaine they gaue it fréely; they haue béene paid swéetely for it.

                  sonne of a Pharise too. Yet, the duetie and loue which Paule did owe and beare to his father and master, should neuer haue excused him before the iudgement-seat of God, if he had cleaued still to the Pharises sect, when God did lighten him with greater knowledge of his truth. As for me, of whom some will giue their iudgement with what spirite I do it, if I iest at your Pharises, or touch your holy mothers whooredomes, and villanies of your holy Father: mens iudgements I depend not of: I neither feare them nor despise them. I haue 1. Cor. 4.4. a iudge to whom I stand. And I content my selfe that he assureth my spirit, I doo it with the same spirit, though not with lyke measure of the same spirit, that 1. Kin. 18.27.

Stapleton against our errour of expounding the scriptures by scriptures: you haue the grounde of it, that they must be expounded by the rule of faith, and therefore not by scriptures onely. Now, as his ground is, so are his proofes: both for your owne meanes first, and afterward against ours. What infallibilitie and certaintie there is in yours,

He replieth against vs, that each of them, alone, and taken by it selfe, is not a perfit way to finde it. In the which aunswere, if you sée not his weakenes (to speake the best of it:) I will set before you a glasse to view it in. It is In the yeare of Christ, 1578. not many yeares ago, since Captaine Stukely (

                        ograph. lib. 4. was sent with sixe hundred Italians by the Pope to take possession of Irelande.
                  
Which he was comming to haue done, but that (at the request of the King of Portugall) He was slain there. Hist. de bello Afr. ca. 13. he went and tooke possession of Barbarie by the way. An English man might say, to comfort good subiectes, that (by Gods grace) these Italians and the Marques, if they had arriued, might haue bene discomfited by the Quéenes army: as the Popes souldiours were, who came after them. D. Sanders might reply, to incourage the rebels, that they néed not feare it: because the Quéenes souldiours, though they haue some strength, yet each of them, alone, and seuered from the rest, cannot ouercome sixe hundred Italians, with such a Captaine too. And for proofe hereof that it is verie likely, he might haue store of arguments, examples, and testimonies, to discourse at large: with as great eloquence, and no lesse wisedome, then D. Stapleton hath done to proue the other. Yet this in D. Stapleton is 
                     Demonstratio methodica principiorum fidei doctrinalium Thomae Stapletoni.
                   a demonstration. Had the other bene a demonstration too? No maruell that you send vs so many bookes ouer, if they be fraught with wares of such demonstration. Maruell, you send no mo: vnlesse it be lawfull for none but publike readers, so subtilly to proue their things by demonstration. Now, if your Doctors answere be absurd, though none of our meanes were certaine and sure, alone, without the rest, to finde the right sense of Scripture: how much more absurd, if any one of them, alone, be sure and certaine, and that in his owne iudgement too? The conference of places of the scripture is so: though he would hide it with a mist. But the mist which 
                     Staplet. prine. doctr. li. 11. c. 10. he casteth, is no thicker then the former. A weake eye may sée through it. For we say, that 
                     Dextera collatio locorum scripturae.
                   
                  a right conference of places, is a way most excellent: as himselfe rehearseth our wordes of that point. And he thereto replyeth, that 
                     Infeliciter adhibita.
                   
                  a wrong conference, a left one, (so to terme it) is no such excellent way. Which is, as if we said, that wise men and vertuous are fit to beare offices in the common-weale: and he, to proue the contrarie, should say that madde men and knaues are no good magistrates. If we can sée through this mist, the conference of places is a perfit way. For that which we meane by conference of places: S. Austin doth signifie by the rule of faith. But 
                     cap. 1. & 3. & 9. the rule of faith, is a way infallible, in your Doctors iudgement. Therefore (to iudge him of his owne mouth) the conference of places is a way infallible. If this alone: much more this & all the rest being ioyned togither. The meanes then which

we commend to vnderstand and expound the scripture: are sure and certaine meanes whereby the right sense of scripture may bée found. But your Doctor saith 
                     cap. 9. that al heretikes, and Iewes, & Paynims vse these meanes, they conferre places, they note the kinde of speeches, they looke vpon the fountains, they marke what goeth before, what commeth after, & such like things. If they doo not so: your Doctor ouer-lasheth. If they doo so: they doo more then himselfe dooth in many cōtrouersies of faith, which yet he teacheth publikely, and printeth them too. What? And do all heretikes, Iewes and Paynims vse these meanes: and doth none of them sée the churches practise; marke the consent of Fathers; read the decrees of councels? If anie of them doo; which it is euident many doo: then by as wise a reason, as your Doctor maketh, these his owne meanes are not sure neyther. Which were a sore consequence, and would raze the church of Rome vnto the ground. Let him bethinke him selfe thereof, and heale the breaches, which (if he looke not to it) his owne shot will make in the walles of his Ierusalem. As for vs and our meanes, if any seeme to vse them, and yet misse the right sense of the scripture: I say with 
                     De doctrin. Christian. lib.

                  S. Austin (whom this quarell maketh as much against, as vs;) If they who know these precepts, cannot see the things which are obscure and darke in the Scriptures of God, the faulte is in them selues, not in the precepts: as if I should point with my finger at a starre, which they would gladly see, and their eie-sight were so weake, that although they could see my finger, yet could they not see the starre at which I point. Wherefore as S. Austin concludeth of them, Let them cease to blame me, and let them pray to God, that hee will giue them eye-sight: so we do acknowledge that al meanes are vaine, vnlesse the Lord giue eies to see: whom therefore the 
                     Psal. 119.18. Prophet made his prayer to, Open mine eies, that I may see the wonders of thy law.

               You may say what you list. But experience sheweth, and it is most certaine, that manye who allow those meanes, which you do, and expound the scripture by them, are themselues deceiued, and deceiue others. For, 
                     Staplet. prin. doctr. lib. 11. cap. 10. 
                  the conference of places by which you set more then by all the rest, which you call a great remedy, and the best exposition of scripture that may be had: let this remedy be taken seuerally and by it selfe, it is marueilous

deceitfull, yea pernicious and pestilent; so much the more, by how much (in shew) it is more probable, and still at least corrupteth two places of scripture, if it be vsed peruersly. In deede, we acknowledge gladly with S. Austin, that place receiueth light of place, and those thinges which one-where are spoken somewhat darkely, are other-where more cleerely vttered. But in conference of scriptures it is to be knowne and diligently marked, 
                     Quod obseruare haeretici nolunt, quia catholici & boni ecclesiae 
                           •
                        ilii esse nolunt.
                   (which heretikes will not marke, because they will not be catholikes, and good children of the church:) first, that one saying may seeme to be like or vnlike an other, not so much for the likenes and vnlikenes of thinges, as for the preiudice and affection of them by whom they are conferred. Secondly, that the same word, or kind of spéech, hath not euery where the same signification, but sometimes diuerse, sometimes contrarie. Thirdly, that there are many places in the scripture, which being vttered only once, haue not any like wherwith you may confer them. Fourthly, and lastly, that all heretikes both of this and of all ages, 
                     Conferendo scripturas diligentissimé, errauerunt tamen in Scripturarum sensu turpissimé.
                   in conferring the scriptures most diligently togither, yet haue erred in the sense of the scriptures most shamefully. Which reasons why the conference of places of scripture is a deceitfull meanes of expounding the scripture, and leadeth often into errour: D. Stapleton, a man well learned out of question, how weake soeuer you account him, hath set downe and proued them with such examples, as might preuaile with you perhaps, if you would weigh them.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I haue weighed them, and I find them to light. The marchant, whom you praise, is rich, I denie not: but sure he vseth false weights, and abuseth the simple, who take their wares vpon his credit. Poore men, conceiuing well of them whom they fansie, thinke him to deale vprightly for that he raileth at others, saying that they are deceauers, because they will not be honest dealers, and good children of the weale publike. But let his words go: and haue an eie to his weights. If you shoulde tell a yoong beginner in shooting that they who looke at the marke and louse directly towards it do not alwaies hit it: your speech were a truth. But if you should say that all naughtie archers which are, or euer were, haue fowlly missed the marke in aiming at it most straightly: he might suspect either your skill, or your will, who traine vp archers so. What may we thinke then of him

who to perswade men that conference of scriptures is a deceitfull way to hit their right sense, doth say that all heretikes both of this and of all ages, in conferring the scriptures most diligently togither yet haue erred in the sense of the scriptures most shamefully? For though they might erre in conferring of them: yet the fault thereof must be, not in conferring them most diligently, but in not conferring them diligently enough. And this is the last of your Doctors reasons. The next before it is no better. He saith, that there are many places in the scripture, which haue not any like wherewith you may conferre them. The proofe he bringeth of it, is, that there are sundry speeches in S. Paule, which are in no Prophet, nor Apostle beside him: as (for example sake) to put of the olde man, and put on the newe. Which proofe is like the point whereof it maketh proofe. For, if the same speeches be not in any other, yet there are speeches lyke them, whereby they may be vnderstood. Or, if not in others: yet in S. Paule himselfe, who lightneth so his owne speeches. Or, if not in him: yet conferre them with the drift and circumstances of the text; the course of thinges and wordes will open what is meant by them. And so alleage what place of scripture you list, the darkest that you can: let a man expound it after our rules, and it will neuer leade him into heresie. For either it hath plaine places to expound it, and being expounded according vnto them, it is farre from heresie: or if it haue no such, it hath no danger of heresie, because all things required to beliefe and life are set downe plainely in the Scriptures. The daunger all lyeth in your first and second point: ye one, touching sayinges, that mens corrupt affections may iudge vnlike or like, when in truth they are not so: the other touching wordes, that may bee mistaken through mens ouersightes, as signifying the same thing, or sundry, which they do not. And by these meanes we grant that the scriptures, may be (and are of many) expounded amisse: to the verifying of that which S. 
                  
                     Pet. 3.16. 
                  Peter writeth of S. Paules epistles, that in them are some thinges hard to be vnderstood: which they that are vnlearned and vnstable do peruert, as they doo also other scriptures, to their owne destruction. Hereof wee haue notable examples in your selues: or (because of yours wee shall speake hereafter) in the Familie of loue, and that ympe of Satan, their maister, Harry Nicolas. Whom the spirite of errour

hath (through an illusion of ignorance) so bewitched, that, as though he tooke a glorie in his shame, to be him selfe, and his, vnlearned, (such as S. Peter pointeth at,) In the gospell of the kingdome, cap 23.6 & 33.11. and so forth in that, and the rest of his pamphlets. he detesteth the learned and skilfull in the scripture, the scripture-wise, as he termeth thē, and giueth it in charge to his babes to shunne them. Christ was too skilfull in scriptures for the Deuill. Else might 
                     Mat. 4.6. the Deuil, by the shew of scripture, which he did alleage (or missealleage rather) haue perseuered with greater hope in tempting Christ. But shall we suspect and mislike the scripture, because hee missealleaged it? or the conference of scripture, because his ympes vse it peruersely? We haue not learned Christ so. Nay, so much the more should we labour and trauaile to search it most diligently, and wisely to conferre it: to wrest by that meanes their sword out of their handes, and kill their owne errour with it. For, the destruction of such spirituall foes, is the sword of the spirite: and 
                     Ephes. 6.17. 
                  the sword of the spirite, is the word of God. So the Familie of loue, which make a mocke of our faith, our saluatiō by Christ, our resurrection, the iudgement, and euerlasting life; and (to saue their frensies from daunger of the scripture) beate flatte the literall sense, which is the edge of it, and put it vp into a scabberd of their fanaticall dreames and allegories: let 
                     Hebr. 4.12. 
                  the two edged sword be drawne out and sharpned with this conference, and, as the flame of fire deuoureth the stubble, so will the point of truth rippe vp the bowels of their errours. So the Arians, when they brought broken sentences of scripture, in shew resembling somewhat their blasphemous doctrine against the sonne of God, but indeede vnlike it: they were ouerthrowne through the conference of

The Amalekites dwel in the south coūtrie; the Hitthites, and Iebusites, and Amorites dwell in the mountaines: the Cananites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Iorden. The

               The Church? Nay you mentioned the godlie before, and spake as if they should trie the truth from errour, by conference of the scriptures. Which is your right kinde of triall and iudgement. But you are ashamed of it now belike, as in truth you may be. For you shall finde many taylers and coblers more godly then sundrie more learned then they. Yet I trust you will not repaire for shreddes and cloutes to any shop of theirs.

may haue greater knowledge perhaps and better iudgement of the sense of scriptures, then ye scarlet gownes of learneder men then they. For the learned Pharisees, 
                  
                     Ioh. 7. ver. 49. who condemned the people as ignorant of the law, did not iudge the doctrine of Christ to be true: nay

                  receiued it with all readinesse, & (vpon the search of the scriptures) beleeued it. Howbeit when I mentioned that iudgement of the godlie, I meant the godlie learned. Wherefore you néeded not to speake of shreddes and cloutes, but that you were loth perhaps to léese this iest. Chiefly, sith I shewed thereupon withall, that, for the triall of controuersies by scripture, ye toongs (in which the scripture is written) must be knowne, namely, Gréeke and Hebrue.

                  the spirites of Prophetes are subiect to the Prophets. In both of the which, the church must yet remember, that God hath committed nothing but the ministerie of giuing iudgement vnto her. The soueraintie of iudgement dooth rest on Gods word. For Christ is

                   to returne vnto the wordes of Christ, from which we digressed: the sense (I gaue of them) will I proue by scripture, according to the rule of faith: the proofe of the sense I submit to the priuate and publike iudgement of the church. The wordes of Christ to Peter, conteined a promise of the keyes, I will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen. The occasion of the

wordes, was a question of Christ, asked of the Apostles, answered by Peter: whom say yee that I am? Thou art Christ the Sonne of the liuing God. The sense which I gathered by laying these together, was, that as Peter answered, one, for all: so the keyes were meant to him, one, with all. To proue the former point, that Peter answered, one, for all: the scripture is most plaine, in the sixt of Iohn, where (before this time) Peter had confessed in their common name,

                  We beleeue, and know, that thou art Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God. To proue the later, that the keyes were meant to him, one, with all: the scripture is as plaine in the twentieth of Iohn, where Christ performing that which he had promised to Peter, doth say to him with the rest,

                  As my Father sent me, so doo I send you. Whose sinnes soeuer ye remit, they are remitted to them: & whose sinnes soeuer ye reteine, they are reteined. Wherefore sith the keyes were promised by Christ on the profession of their fayth, which was common to them all: and the promise was performed, when he sent them all with power to binde and loose, to remit and reteine sinnes: it followeth that the keyes belonged no more to Peter, then to all the Apostles. And therefore the promise of the keyes to him, importeth no headship of his ouer them.
            
            
               Hart.
               That which was promised by Christ vnto Peter, was not performed to the Apostles. For, he gaue not them the keyes of his kingdome: but the power of remitting and reteyning sinnes.

               These things differ in wordes, but they are one in sense: as Ioseph said to Pharao, 
                  
                     Gen. 41.25. 
                  Both Pharaos dreames are one. For as God, to teach Pharao what he would do in Egipt by seuen yeares of plentie, & seuen yeares of famine, did vse two sundrie dreames, of kine, and eares of corne, the surer to resolue him of his purpose in it: so Christ, to teach vs what he doth for mankind in ordeining the ministerie of the word & Sacraments, 
                     Mat. 16.19. vseth two similituds, the one, of keyes, the other, of binding & loosing, that we may know the better the fruit & force of it. Touching ye 
                  keyes: he speaketh of heauen, as of a house, wherinto there is no entrance for men, vnlesse the doore be opened. Now we (all Adams ofspring) are shut out of heauen, as Adam our progenitour was out of Paradise, through our offenses and sinnes. For

                  no vncleane thing shall enter into it. But

                  Christ sent his Apostles as his Father sent him, to preach his word to men, that they who repented and beleeued in Christ should haue their sinnes forgiuen them, the faithlesse & vnrepentant should not be forgiuen: then he gaue authoritie as it were to open heauen to the faithfull, and to shut it against the wicked.

From these cordes of sinne, and chaines of death eternall, men are loosed by Christ, when their sinnes be remitted: their sinnes are remitted, if they beleeue in him.

Which thinges being so, this summe ariseth of them, that, sith the keyes of the kingdome of heauen are all one with the power of binding and loosing, of remitting and reteining sinnes: Christ therefore, when he promised the keyes, meant that power; and, when he gaue that power, gaue the keyes.

For a great deale more excellent is the power of remitting sinnes, then of excommunicating or suspending a man from his office or honour: and therfore this may be exercised by him that is not a Priest, whereas the other belongeth vnto Priestes onely.

Wherefore in these last wordes is promised to Peter, not onely power of binding and loosing in the court, either outward or inward; which both are onely 
                     Partiales actus ipsarum clauium: that is, part of those things which are done by the keyes. partiall actions of the keyes. But because the keyes themselues were promised him, indefinitly, and were not restrained to any one kinde of opening or shutting: doubtlesse all the power which is conteined in the keyes was promised to him, how great soeuer it be, and of what sort soeuer. Now

                           •

                   the whole power, and correspondent fully and euenly to the keyes, is to open and shut: what meanes soeuer it be done by. For, to open and shut is the duetie of keyes: in token whereof the keyes of the citie are brought vnto the chéefest magistrate, that by his commandement the citie may be shut and opened. To receiue the keyes therefore of the kingdome of heauen, is, to receiue the power of shutting and opening the kingdome of heauen: whither you take the name of the kingdome of heauen for euerlasting life, or for the communion of the militant church. Now this is done by diuers and many other wayes, beside those of binding and loosing in either court. For Pastors doo open and shut the kingdome of heauen, (the one, by exercising that power; the other, by withdrawing it) in their whole spirituall gouernment: in preaching of the word, in ministring of Sacraments, in making of lawes, in expounding of the holy scripture, in declaring articles of faith, in deciding pointes of cōtrouersie and doubt. To be short, the keyes of the church may be diuided, into the keye of knowledge,
                  
and the key of power. To open the scriptures, belongeth to the key of knowledge: which Christ himselfe exercised in the foure and twentieth of Luke, and whereof he saide to the Lawiers, 
                     Luk. 11.52. 
                  ye haue taken away the key of knowledge, and so foorth. The key of power, is either of order, or iurisdiction. And iurisdiction it selfe is either in the outward court, by excommunicating, by suspending from office, by granting of pardons, and making of lawes: or in the inward court, by forgiuing of sinnes. All this

                   most ample power, & correspondent wholly and euenly to the keyes, is promised in this place by Christ to Peter onely. Which, as the force and meaning of the worde [keyes,] so the kinde of spéech of holy scripture sheweth. For (in Esay the Prophet) when it had béene sayd 
                     Summo sacerdoti Eliachim.
                   to the hye Priest Eliakim in the figure of Christ, 
                     Esai. 22.22. 
                  The key of the house of Dauid will I laye on his shoulder: the scripture declaring the vse of this key dooth by and by adde; and he shall open and none shall shut, he shal shut and none shall open. Which likewise is spoken againe of the person of Christ in ye 
                  Apocalypse: for he is called

Wherefore, as Eliakim in figure, Christ in truth, receiuing the key of the house of Dauid, that is, of the church, or the kingdome of heauen, receiued withall the power of shutting and opening: in like sort S. Peter being to receiue (in the roome and stéede of Christ) the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, is (out of controuersie) to receiue withall the power of shutting and opening; that is to say, not onely of binding and loosing in iudgement of both the courtes, which are onely

               This long and smooth tale, which you haue tolde out of your Doctor, is like to that nightingale to which 
                     Plutarch in a

                   a Lacedemonian, when he had plucked her feathers off, and sawe a litle caraine left, said, Thou art a voice, nought else. Plucke off the feathers of your tale: the body is a poore carkase, and hath no substance in it. Howbeit, the names of the two courtes, the outward court, the inward court, with other tunes of like musike: are very sweete melodie in the eares of them, whose hartes are in the court of Rome. As for simple men, who haue béene onelye conuersant in 
                     Psal. 34.2. 
                  the courtes of the Lord: they sound to them like straunge languages, and seeme to containe more profound mysteries then we can reach the depth off. But, to open your answere, that it may be séene what is vnsound in it: this is the point of the thing in controuersie. I say that the power promised to Peter by the name of the keyes, in the sixtéenth of Matthew: was performed and giuen to all the Apostles by the commission of Christ, in the twentieth of Iohn. You with Stapleton deny it. Why? Because the keyes promised to Peter do signifie all kind of power; wherof a part onely was giuen to the Apostles, to bind and loose in either court. And how proue you this? Forsooth, bicause by these wordes, whatsoeuer thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heauen, Christ doth

                  not expound what he meant by the keies, as some men (say you) haue thoughtthat he doth. Then some men haue thought that the power of the keyes, and the power of binding and loosing are all one: the later added by Christ to expound the former. In deede I thought so: and I perceaue by you that I thought not so alone: some other men haue thought it too. But, you say it is not, as some men haue thought. Yet you do not tell vs the names of these [some men.] Might we knowe (I praye) what these [some men] be?

               To confirme you in your errour. But learned men do vary in expounding of Scriptures: some hitte the marke, some misse it. And D. Stapleton, reading many of all 
                     •
                  ortes, might fall on some expounding it amisse (as you do,) whom hée

               This modestie I like not. The truth is, hee durst not name them, least wee should know them, and bee the more strengthned by them in the truth to the confounding of your errour. For, these [some men] whom hee so lightly trippeth ouer, are, but al the Fathers: who haue with one consent expounded Christes promise of the keyes, as we do. Now, the exposition which the Fathers make, is (by his owne iudgement) the churches exposition, which hath the right sense of the scripture. And so while he is launching out into the deepe, to fetch in a prise for Peter of Romes supremacie: hee maketh shipwracke in the hauen.

                   when he discoursed of Christes wordes to Peter, Whatsoeuer thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heauen: said, that all power of the keyes is therein promised, not restrained to part, but enlarged to what soeuer. Yea, that Christ likewise promised the same power to all the Apostles, when 
                  
                     Mat. 18.18. 
                  he spake in like wordes, Whatsoeuer ye bind on earth, shall be bound in heauen, & what soeuer ye loose on earth, shall be loosed in heauen. For, albeit Origen (more subtilly, then literally) doth put a difference betweene the promises, because, in the one, the word,

                  [heauens:] yet the common exposition of S. Ierom, S. Hilarie, S. Anselme, and others vpon this place, yea of S. Austin him selfe in his treatise vpon Iohn, is, that Christ speaketh of the power of the keyes by which the Apostles and their successours do bynd or loose sinners. And although it seemeth, that here is chiefely meant the power of iurisdiction whereby sinners are excommunicate: yet the said Fathers doo vnderstand it of

both the powers, not onely of iurisdiction but of order too. And that may be gathered (it seemeth) by the text. For it is said as generally to the Apostles, What things soeuer ye shal bind: as it is to Peter, What thing soeuer thou shalt bind.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Perhaps Father Robert doth bring in these thinges by way of an obiection, and frameth thereunto an answere, and so resolueth to the contrarie.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               No. But he bringeth your opinion in deede by way of an obiection, and frameth thereunto an answere, and so resolueth to the contrary. For thus he goeth forward. What? Is that giuen then to all the Apostles, which was promised to Peter? Caietan (in his treatise of the Popes authority) saith that the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and the power of byndyng and loosing, are not all one: for that to bynd and loose is lesse then to open and shut. But this doctrine seemeth to be more subtill then true. For it is a thing vnheard of, that there are in the Church any other keyes then the keyes of order and of iurisdiction. And the sense of those wordes, I will giue thee the keyes, and whatsoeuer thou shalt bind and loose, is plaine: that first, a certaine power and authoritie is promised; afterward, the function of it is declared. Now the function of these keyes is declared by the wordes to bind and loose, not by the wordes, to shut and open: that we may vnderstand they be metaphoricall and borowed kindes of speeches; neither heauen is opened properly, but it is said that heauen is opened then with these keyes when men are loosed and dispatched of the difficulties and infirmities which shut them out of heauen, and so forth. Thus saith your chiefest reader, and Iesuit Robert Bellarmin: whose iudgement (by your leaue) I farre esteeme, in this point, aboue D. Stapletons, as more agreeable to the scriptures.

                   the oth-maker, meant not to bind you to it. Let vs giue a passeport then vnto the Fathers. It may be that the man was moued (in conscience)

by light of truth to vary from them. Let vs heare what moued him. The same is not meant (saith he) by the keyes, and by the wordes, to bynd and loose, as some men haue thought. And why? For all the Schoolemen are of opinion, that to bynd and loose doth note a power iudiciall in the outward court onely: to remit and retayne sinnes, in the inward court. By the outward court, he meaneth the consistorie: wherein the church-discipline and censure is exercised. By the inward court, the conscience: wherein a mans trespasses and sinnes are bound or loosed. So (in effect) he saith, that the power of remitting sinnes and censuring sinners, were onely meant (in the spéeches of Christ) to the Apostles: and not the most ample and large power of keyes (promised to Peter) 
                     Omnium Doctorum scholasticorum sententia.
                   
                  by the iudgement of all the Schoolemen. Which proofe, though it cannot weigh as much for him, as the Fathers against him: yet herein his dealing is orderly and plaine, that, leauing the Fathers, he cleaueth to the Schoolemen. For (when all is done) the Schoolemen are the men that must vphold Papistrie: with the fréendly helpe of the Canonists their bréethren. The Scriptures and Fathers would be pretended for a shew, to countenance the matter. But they are like to images in olde buildings of antike worke: which are framed so, that with their shoulders they séeme to beare the roofe, whereas that in déed doth rest on walles or pillars. The Schoolemen and the Canonists, the fountaines of the corruption which hath infected the Church of Christ; the Schoolemen, in doctrine, by the opinions of Popery; the Canonistes, in discipline, by the state of the Papacie: the Schoolemen and the Canonists are the two pillars that vphold your Church, as 
                     Iudg. 16.29. 
                  the house of Dagon, in the which the Philistines triumph and insult ouer the faith and God of Samson. What then, if the Schoolemen, whose 1. Tim. 6.2

                     . 
                  oppositions of science falsely so called, are noted by S. Paule, that Timothee may auoid them, who (the most ofthem) came with féete vnwashed into the Lordes sanctuarie, who being ignorant of the tongues wherein the holy Ghost wrote, (great helpes to vnderstand his meaning,) searched not the sense of scripture in the scripture, but in humaine sense, and so expounded it thereafter: what, if they say, that to bynd and loose doth make a iudge onely in the outward court: to remit and retayne sinnes, in the inward court: and both import lesse then the keyes, which open all in court and country?

I haue prooued the contrary by conference of the Scriptures. You can not deny but that the Fathers teach the contrary. Where is your discretion? Who, though the Scriptures (as we proue,) the Fathers (as you graunt,) do say it is so: yet you say it is not so, because the Schoolemen thinke not so. As if you should say in a matter of state, which is allowed and ordained by the Quéene and Councell, that although they will it, yet may it not be doone: why? because the Yeomen ofthe kitchin like it not.

But as Canus speaketh of Schoole-diuines, and Schoole-diuinitie: he and I dissent not, though I bée against them, and he for them, in shew. Sophocles, the poet, (a writer of tragedies) being asked ofhis frend, why, whē he brought in the persons ofwomen, he made them alwaies good, whereas Euripides made them badde: because I (quoth he) doo

represent women such as they should be: Euripides, such as they be. So the matter fareth betweene me and Canus. For he dooth paint out Schoolemen such as they should be: and I such as they be. I speake against them who peruerting the scriptures, haue prophaned diuinitie with philosophie, or rather sophistrie, and yet are called Schoole-diuines, whē they are neither Schollers in truth, nor Diuines.

For hauing taught that the keyes promised to Peter were only two, of order, and of iurisdiction: he declared that Christ did giue them both to his Apostles: the key of iurisdiction ouer all the world, in that he said to them, As my Father sent me, so doo I sende you, which Cyrill and Chrysostom note vpon it; the key of order in the wordes that immediatly follow, Receiue the holy Ghost, whose sinnes soeuer ye remit, they are remitted to them, whose sinnes soeuer ye reteine, they are reteined.

Now, these two sayings agrée well togither: that it is giuen, by the one; & by the other it is not.

Wherefore your selfe offend in that you touch him, when you doo touch him as a lyer. A common fault with Protestants, in dealing against vs: which argueth your church of what brood it is.

And I am perswaded, that if he knew that, and other thinges, which you finde fault with: what soeuer hee hath written, hée woulde make it good.

               I wish with all my hart, he would. For then he should repent, and amend his errors: the onely way to make that good, which is euill. But thus you may sée (by his own confession) that Christ gaue the keyes to all the Apostles which he promised to Peter. For seing by the keyes is signified the full power, and the full power was giuen to them all: it foloweth that the keies were giuen to them all.

               Some such thing it is, that your men would say. But (to confesse mine owne ignorance) I do not vnderstand what they meane by it. Which I should perhaps be ashamed off, if you (who handle it) your selues did vnderstand it, or gaue vs sense and reason of it. For, if all the power, which Bishops haue, as Bishops, be the power of the keyes; and the Apostles, as Apostles, had all the power of the keyes committed vnto them by Christ; both the which things the Scriptures proue, & you disproue not: then was there no power, which they might receiue of Peter, as Bishops; and therefore they did not receiue any of him, nor were inferiour to him therein▪ Yet this is the very foundation of the Papacie: but laid on such sand, that the maister builders who trauaile most in laying it, do reele (like dronken men) about it, too and fro; and strooken with a blindnes, as

                  by the laying (as it were) of the fyry tongues vpon them, whē they receiued the holy Ghost. And this he proueth by S. Ierom, S. Denys, and other Fathers. Of whose opinion it ensueth, that, graunting the Apostles were ordeined Bishops, as in a generall sense, (in which their charge is called

Stapleton, vncertaine how to beare him selfe betwéene these two opinions, the later being truer, the former safer for the Pope: he faltereth in his spéech, as though (according to the prouerbe) hee had a woolfe by the eares, whom neither he durst let go out of his hands, nor holde, for feare of danger. For of the one side he is loth to graunt the truth, lest it should preiudice the title of the Pope: yet loth of the other side to deny it also, because 
                     Mat. 21.26.

                     cap. 7. that all the Apostles were sent by Christ, with full power, yea with power most full, and equall vnto Peters power. From hence he turneth backe, and taketh vp his olde song, 
                     cap. 8. that Christ gaue all power ecclesiasticall to Peter onely, and so by him to others. Which string because it giueth a very swéete sound: 
                     cap. 6. & 7. & 8. & 10. & 15. he harpeth on it often. Afterward, either doubting the conscience of weake Catholikes, or the euill tonges of Caluinists, who fauour the Apostles, and cannot heare them so debased: he saith 
                     cap. 15. that the Apostles were sent immediately of God with full power vnto al nations. Yet by and by falling againe vnto his giddines, (through some pang belike of The Pope.

                     cap. 15. that the spring of honour and power is deriued from Peter alone to all the rest. And thus he goeth on, through the whole discourse, (both in this, and the rest of his Doctrinall Principles,) enterfeiring as it were at euery other pace, and hewing hoofe against hoofe. But so will

the Lord confound the toongs of them who doo build vp Babylon. Yet here, for these cuttings wherwith he gasheth himself, he thinketh that they may be healed with a distinction taken vp in Cardinall Turrecrematas shop, of a twofold power, the one Apostolike, the other Bishoply: the rest of the Apostles to haue béene inferior to Peter in the Bishoply, though equall in the Apostolike; and all to haue receiued the Apostolike power immediatly of Christ, the rest (as namely Iames) their Bishoply power of Peter. But two learned Friers, Sixtus Senensis, and Franciscus Victoria (men of better reading and iudgement then either he, or Turrecremata) haue cast off this quirke as a rotten drugge, before Stapleton tooke it vp.

Your answeres vnto me, are very like to these, but somewhat more vnorderly. For to ground the Popes supremacie on Peter: you said that the Apostles did all receiue their power, at least, their bishoply power of him. You must make it manifest that they did so. All the Apostles were to receiue their power of Peter. What scripture saith so? I know not. Did they receiue it? No. Who did hinder it? They should haue done it.
                  
Should they haue done it? How proue ye it? I can not tell. I may not say of you, as Tully of Erucius, What is it else to abuse the lawes and iudgements and maiestie of the iudges to lucre and to lust, then so to accuse, and to obiect that, which you not onely can not proue, but do not as much as endeuour to proue it. For I must beare you witnes, you endeuour to proue it. But you shall do better to surcease that endeuour, vnlesse your proofes be sounder, and haue not onely shew, but also weight of trueth in them.

               Hart.
               Why so?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Because in the charge of feeding sheepe and lambes, neither was the commission giuen vnto Peter: and if it were, yet no more was committed to him then to the rest of the Apostles: and if more, yet not so much, as should make him their supreme head.
            
            
               Hart.
               If you proue the second of these thrée pointes: the other two are superfluous.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               They are so. But you shall haue weight with aduantage, to ouerwaigh your weight to vs ward. And, for the first: I haue alreadie shewed, that the commission which Christ gaue to Peter, he had giuen it him 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . 20.21. before, when he said, As my father sent me: so do I send you. Receiue the holie Ghost. Whose sins soeuer ye remit, they are remitted to them: whose sinnes soeuer ye reteine, they are reteined.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               But Christ gaue him not so much at that time, as hée had promised him. Wherefore, part of his promise being performed then, part was performed after: then, as much as he had ioyntly with the Apostles; after, that he had ouer them.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               This is your bulwarke of Peters supremacie: but it is builded on a lye. For all that Christ had promised him, was implied in that he had said, 
                     Matt. 16.19. 
                  To thee will I giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen. Was it not?
            
            
               Hart.
               It was so: what then?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But in this commission (sending him with ful authoritie and power) he gaue him all the keyes of the kingdome of heauen. In this commission therefore he gaue him all that he had promised.
            
            
               Hart.
               I deny that he gaue him all the keyes in this commission.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I proue it. All the keyes, (as it hath appeared by 
                     Chapt. 2. Diuis. 3. your owne confession) are onely too, the key of knowledge and of power: or rather both of power, by Thomas of Aquines iudgement, whom you rather follow. But Christ gaue him both those in this commission: 
                     Ioh. 20.21. 
                  As my Father sent me, so doo I send you; Receiue the holie Ghost. Wherefore in this commission he gaue him all the keyes of the kingdome of heauen. And whatsoeuer keyes he gaue him in this, he gaue the same to all the rest

of the Apostles. He gaue as much authoritie therefore to them all: as he gaue to Peter. But that is the next point.
            
            
               Hart.
               Yet they receiued 
                     Act. 2.1. afterward the holie Ghost from heauen in the day of Pentecost. And therefore they receiued not their whole commission of Christ at this time: they wayted for a part of it.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Yes: it was a part of their commission so to waite. For (as it is further declared by S. Luke) when 
                     Luc. 24. v
                           •
                        r. 45. 
                  their vnderstanding was opened by Christ that they might vnderstād the scriptures: he commanded them to 
                     ver. 49. 
                  stay in Ierusalem, vntill they were indued with power from an high. A King who putteth men in commission of peace, doth giue them authoritie to execute that charge by the wordes of his commission. If they perhaps haue not such wealth as is requisite for Iustices of peace to discharge their duetie; and the King will giue them landes by such a day, thereby to furnish them vnto it: they receiue by their landes, not authoritie, which they had; but abilitie which they wanted: and the better they are landed, the more are they inabled, but not the more authorized to execute their duetie. Christ, the King of Kings, did put his Apostles in 
                     Rom. 10.15. 2. Cor. 5.20. the commission of peace: of heauenly peace, not earthly; not bodily, but spirituall; not temporall, but eternall. Their authoritie they receiued by the wordes of his commission. But the discharge of the duetie required great treasures of the holie Ghost. Whereof hée gaue them some 
                     Ioh. 20.22. then; more in the 
                     Act. 2.3. 
                  fiery toonges from heauen; more 
                     Act. 10.11. & 11.18. as the churches state required; and these, 
                     Luc. 19.16. well occupied, gained more: with the increase whereof their abilitie still increased; their authoritie not so, which all was giuen them at once.
            
            
               Hart.
               But a King, for better triall of his Iustices, may commit some lesser authoritie first vnto them, and afterwarde greater.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  
                     Matt. 10.5. So did Christ to his Apostles. But hauing made triall of them in the lesser, he called them by this commission to the greater: nay, to the greatest, then which he had no greater for them.
            
            
               Hart.
               Not within the limits perhaps of their commission: yet he might enlarge them, and giue them greater limits.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But Christ in this commission had giuen them

authoritie through all his dominion, not through a shire onely. For he sent them 
                     Marc. 16.15. Luc. 24.47. 
                  to all nations.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               And what, if I grant, that Christ in this commission gaue all that power to Peter, which he had promised him, & was to giue vnto him?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               If he gaue him all that power in this commission: no part thereof remained to be giuen in any other. If no part to be giuen: then was there no further power giuen to him by those wordes of Christ, Feede my lambes, feede my sheepe. If no further power were giuen him thereby, the bulwarke of your Papacy is builded on a fansie.
            
            
               Hart.
               Then belike our Sauiour spake to no purpose, when he said to Peter, 
                  
                     Ioh. 21. ver. 15 1

               Rainoldes.
               God forbid. To great purpose: though not to yours. For he giueth him therein a commandement, though not a commission. As if the Quéenes Maiestie, hauing made alreadie by letters of commission some Iustices in the North, & one perhaps amongst them, of whose faithfull heart she were persuaded well, yet, that had shewed himselfe not of the trustiest in time of the rebellion, shée should say vnto him (to stirre in him a liuely regard of his duetie,) Do you loue vs? Haue care of our poore subiectes: Doo you loue vs? Haue care of our good people. Which charge and commaundement Christ might giue a great deale better to Peter, then the Quéene to any Iustice in ye North: because shée knoweth not whither any new Bull be comming from Rome, or new rebellion be toward. But he knew that Peter should be in greater danger, then he was when he fled, and denied his Maister. Whereof, he forewarneth him (straight vpon the giuing him of this commandement) and that, with earnest Verely, verely I say vnto thee. words of great asseueration, as in a matter of weight: telling him, 
                     Ioh. 21.18. that he should dye a gréeuous death for his profession of the faith and féeding of the flocke of Christ. So yt, to arme him against that feare of the flesh, which before had made him to betray his duetie, when he had lesse cause to feare: Christ hauing made the iron hot, as it were, by asking him, Doost thou loue mee? striketh it, to make it a fit instrument to build with, & so commandeth, Feede my flocke; yea though the worke be painefull,

and will cost thée déere: for it shall bring thée to thy death. So, he committeth not a new charge to Peter, but willeth him to looke to that, which he had committed, and flée not from it for any danger. As if a wise shipmaster, séeing a daungerous storme at hand, should command his mariners whom he had well deserued of, that, if they loue him, they looke vnto their tackelings.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Well. If it were (perhaps) not a commission, but a commandement: yet was it a commandement to discharge that duetie, wherewith he was put in trust by commission.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I grant. What inferre you?
            
            
               Hart.
               Then Peter had commission to feede the lambes and sheepe of Christ.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Who dooth deny it? For 
                     Ioh. 20.21. he had the same commission from Christ, that 
                     Luc. 4.18. 
                  Christ from God his Father, to preach the Gospell to the poore, to heale the broken-hearted, to preach deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering of sight to the blind, to set at libertie them that are bruised and preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord. Which is, in other wordes, to feede the lambes and sheepe of Christ. For Christ by a similitude, is named the 
                  1. Pet. 5. ver. 4. 
                  chiefe shepheard: his church, and chosen seruants, 
                     ver. 2. 
                  a flocke of sheepe and lambes; whereof he gaue a principall charge to his Apostles, that they should féede it. Wherefore the commandement giuen vnto Peter to feede his sheepe and lambes: importeth the commission which before was giuen him, when Christ sent him, as God sent Christ. But in this commission the Apostles all were equall vnto Peter. They were equall therefore to him in charge of feeding the sheepe and lambes of Christ. And so the second point which I had to proue (the verie deaths-wound of your supremacy) is proued.
            
            
               Hart.
               Proued? How proued?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               As clearely, as the Sunne dooth shine at noone day. For, to send the Apostles, as God the Father sent Christ, is to giue them charge to feede his sheepe and lambes. But Christ sent the Apostles, as God the Father sent him. Therefore he gaue them charge to feede his sheepe & lambes. Now, this is the greatest power, that can be shewed, was giuen Peter by Christ. Wherefore in the greatest power, that Christ gaue

him, the rest of the Apostles all were his equals. If you be loth herein to beleeue the Scripture: yet beleeue the Pope, and Pope Anacletus▪ Dist.

               It is true that the Apostles were equall to Peter: but in respect of their Apostleship, not of their Pastorall charge.

               This answere of yours, hath a distinction, but not a difference. It is the same fellow, but in an other gowne, whom (

               Rainoldes.
               Because you did distinguish the Bishoply power of the Apostles, from their power Apostolike: as here (with other wordes) you doo their Apostleship from their Pastorall charge. Whereas in déede the pastorall charge of the Apostles is nothing els but their Apostleship: and hath no more difference then the other had. For the name of Pastor is vsed in two senses, a speciall, and a generall. In the speciall, to note a kind of function distinct from the Apostles, (
                     Staplet. princ. doctr. lib. 6. c. 7. & 15. your Doctor graunteth it,) and so Apostles are not Pastors: as when it is said, 
                     Ephes. 4.11. 
                  some Apostles, some Prophets, some Euangelistes, some Pastors and teachers. In the general, to signifie the cōmon charge of al such, as do teach the word and féede the flocke of God: in which respect 
                     Ioh. 10.11. Christ him selfe is called a Pastor. Wherefore sith Apostles are not Pastors by the former sense; by the later, whosoeuer are equall in the Apostleship, must néedes consequently be equal in the Pastorship too: your distinction, that they were equal in the one not in the other, hath no more reason, then an other of

                  D. Stapletons, who saith, that they were equall in power of gouernment, but not of regiment.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               You depraue his wordes. For he saith that this is the greatest difference betweene Peter and the rest of the Apostles, that Christ gaue to Peter the power of regiment, or to commaund: to the Apostles only the power of gouernmēt, or to execute: because in gouernment of the church Peter must prescribe, what should be done, and they must execute it.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I depraue them not, vnlesse he speake sottishly,

he knoweth not him selfe what. For his drift is, to proue, that the Apostles all had equall power giuen them by Christ, but with a threefold difference: of which this is one, that they had equall power (forsooth) to doo and execute all things that appertaine to the building of the Church; but so, that Peter had the power of regiment, to commaund, the rest of the Apostles the power of gouernment, to execute. Which is as ridiculous, as if a man would say, that the Queenes Maiestie and the Sheriffes of London haue equall power both: yet with a difference, to witte, that her Maiestie hath the power of regiment, that is, to commaund, when a traitor shall suffer, and the Sheriffes the power of gouernment, that is, to execute that which shee commandeth. If you should preach thus in London: our Londoners would smile at it. I thinke that this heresie hath made our wits dull. Your Catholike distinctions are so sharpe and subtill, that wee cannot conceiue them.
            
            
               Hart.
               You may flout as well, if you list, at S. Gregory: who though he vse not the wordes of this distinction, yet he hath the sense of it: saying, 
                     Grego. Registr. lib. 4. epist. 38. that Andrewe, Iames, and Iohn were heads of seuerall congregations, and all, members of the Church, vnder one head Peter.

               If I should touch Gregory for this, I should do him wrong: as great wrong almost, as your 
                     lib. 6. cap. 7. Doctor doth, who alleageth it out of Gregory. For though he were him-selfe a Bishop of Rome, and a well-willer of S. Peters: yet in that epistle (whence those wordes are cited) he calleth Christ

               Why? Are you sure that there is no copie of S. Gregories workes, which hath the name of Peter inserted in that place.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I thinke that none hath: I am sure that none should haue. For, in 
                     Gregor. Registr. l. 4. epist. 36. an other epistle of the same argument, whē he had said yt al Christians 
                     Soli vni capiti cohaerent, videlicet Christo.
                   
                  do cleaue to only one head, he addeth, Imeane, to Christ: and hauing (in this same epistle) put that difference betwéene Christ and Peter, that Peter is a member, Christ the head of the church, he sheweth manifestly whom he meant by head. A thing so apparant, that

How much the more shamefull is Stapletons dealing, who foysteth in [Peter:] to set (by that conueiance) the Pope in Christes roome. But you were best to go forward with the scriptures: and then (when you haue found nothing in them,) come to the Fathers after.
            
            
               Hart.
               You are very peremptorie still in your spéeches. I wil find in them as much for the substance as I haue affirmed▪ For, howsoeuer the wordes of Pastorall charge, and the Apostleship; the power of regiment, and gouernment, agree with my meaning: my meaning, (I am sure) agreeth with the scriptures, and standeth with good reason.

               Hart.
               This is my meaning, that Peter had authoritie ouer the Apostles to féede them, to rule them, to be a Pastor of them: which the rest of the Apostles had neither ouer him nor one ouer an other.

               So. Now make proofe of it.

               Christ did say to Peter: 
                  
                     Ioh. 21.17. 
                  Doost thou loue me? Feede my sheepe. Whereof thus I reason. Christ did charge Peter to feede his sheepe, all; euen all his shéepe, without exception. But the Apostles were sheepe of Christ. Therefore he had the charge of feeding them also.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Christ saide to the Apostles, 
                     Marc. 16.15. 
                  Go ye into all the world▪ and preach the Gospell to euery creature. Whereof thus I reason. Christ did charge his Apostles to preach the Gospell to euerie creature, to euerie one without exception. But Peter was a creature. Therefore they had the charge of preaching to him also. Now, if I would play with wordes as your men doo: I could shew that this reason must ouermaster yours in the plaine field. For Christ said not to Peter, feed all my sheepe: but he said to the Apostles, preach to euerie creature.

               But you should consider 
                     Staplet. princ. doctr. li. 6. ca. 10. that Christ giuing that commandement to Peter, gaue it with a difference betwéene the shéepe and the lambes, as 
                     Commentar. in Luc. lib. 10. 
                  S. Ambrose hath noted well, (set me downe, I pray, his owne wordes in Latin:) tertiò Dominus interrogauit: & noniam agnos, vt primò, quodam lacte pascendos; nec ouiculas, vt secundò; sed oues pascere iubetur, perfectiores vt perfectior gubernaret. That is to say, When the Lord had asked Peter the third time, Doost thou loue me? hee is commanded now to feede, not the lambes, as at the first time, who must be fedde with certaine milke; not the litle sheepe as the seconde time; but to feede the sheepe, that he (a man more perfit) might gouerne the more perfit. So that the whole flocke of Christ was committed to Peter to be fedde, as well the small as the great; both the lay men, who, as lambes, are fedde themselues, and féede not others; & the Priests and Clergie, who, as sheepe, doo féede the lambes, but are fedde of the shepheard.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  The lambes and the sheepe doo signifie two

kindes of Christians: the one yonger and tenderer, which néedeth to be taught the first principles of religion, as it were 
                     Hebr. 5.12. to be fedde with milke: the other riper and elder, fit to learne the déeper mysteries of faith, to be fedde with strong meat. This S. Ambrose noted well in the commandement that Christ gaue to Peter. Though the difference, which he maketh betwéene the second and the third,

                   Roman reader hath spied more in it, who saith that the text ought to be corrected, and read as Ambrose cited it. But your glose, of the lay-men to be signified by lambes, and by the sheepe the Priestes and Clergie: dooth varie from ye text, not of Christ onely, but of Ambrose too. For wheras they speake of the lambes, and the sheepe, both which the flocke consisteth of: you interpret their words of the sheepe, and the shepheards. And whereas all Pastors are bounde to feede both sheepe and lambes: you make as though ye rest must féede none but lambes, and all the sheepe were Peters. From dreaming whereof S. Ambrose was so farre, that 
                     De dignit. sacerdot. cap. 2. Eas cum illo nos suscepimus omnes.
                   he saith of the shéepe which Christ commanded to be fedde: Peter did not only receiue the charge of them, but himselfe and all Bishops receiued it with Peter. Wherefore, you should consider, that in Christes commission vnto the Apostles they are not considered as shéepe, but as shepheards: and therefore not them-selues to be fed of any, but all to féede others. So, when they abode togither in Ierusalem: they sed the church in common (with, 
                     Act. 2.
                        •
                     2.
                  the doctrine of the Apostles) not Peter them, and they the rest. And when they went thence into other countries: they went not as shéepe with Peter their shepheard, but as seuerall shepheards to shéepe of all nations.
            
            
               Hart.
               Be it so: that Christ spake (in his commission) to them, as to shepheards. Yet were they also shéepe of the flocke of Christ. And therefore he might well appoint a shepheard ouer them.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               And was not Peter also a shéepe of Christs flock? And must▪ not our Sauiour appoint by this reason, a shepheard ouer him also? For, if all sheepe need it: why not S. Peter? If some néed it not: why the Apostles? But, it is true, that, as they were shéepe, so néeded they sometimes to bee

fedde, the best of them: and this did Christ prouide for, though not with your policie; not by setting one as Pastor ouer all, but by geuing charge of euery one to other. For as S. Paule said to the Elders of Ephesus, 
                  
                     Act. 20.2
                        •
                     . 
                  Take heed vnto your selues and to all the flocke, charging them with care not of their flocke onely, but of themselues too, all of all, and ech of other: in like sort the Apostles who had charge of all in that they were shepheardes, were to be looked too, in that they were sheepe, to be admonished, taught, fedde, not euery one of Peter, but euery one of other, yea euen Peter also him selfe, if néede required. Hereof their practise is a proofe. For 
                     Gal. 2.14. whē 
                  Peter went not with a right foote to the truth of the Gospell: S. Paule reproued him openly before all men for it. But to reproue him was to féede him. Therefore S. Paule did feede S. Peter.

                  S. Paule reproued him, not by authority, but of curtesie: and Peter yelded to it, not of duetie, but of modestie. As now any Bishop may reproue the Pope: and he will harken to it patiently, and mildly; and yet impaire not his supremacie.

                   which (in the booke of Ceremonies of the church of Rome, in the chapter, that the Pope doth do reuerēce to no man) saith, that notwithstanding the maiestie and solemnitie, which he vseth to highest states in entertaining of them: yet Popes are accustomed (whē they are not in their pōtificals) to

                  Marry this, not of duetie: but of laudable curtesie. The Pope shewed not you this curtesie, M. Hart, when he admitted you to kisse his holinesse foote: it was not for his state to doo it. Yet hath he so bewitched your senses therewith, that you (to render him not duetie, but curtesie) forget both curtesie, and duetie, to Paule the Apostle, the chosen instrument of God, and penneman of his holy spirite. For S. Paule mentioneth his reproofe purposely, to proue, that he was Peters equall in authoritie: against the false Apostles, who sought to discredite the doctrine which he taught, by deba
                     •
                  ing him and setting others farre aboue him. You say that he reproued Peter, of curtesie, and not by authoritie. Wherby (marke it well) you say in effect, that he made a foolish reason to proue a false conclusion.

And, if he were inferiour to Peter in authority, as he was by your answeare: what meant he to say that 2. Cor. 11.5. 
                  he accounted himselfe

                  S. Paule was equall in authoritie to Peter, in some sort. Yet this is a notable difference betweene them, and well worth the marking, that S. Paule was the Apostle and teacher of the Gentiles: but Peter the Apostle both of Gentiles and of Iewes. Which (because we loue not to speake without Doctors) you may read in S. Ambrose, in his Cōmentaries on this place,

                  He that wrought by Peter in the Apostleship of circumcision, wrought by me also towardes the Gentiles. He nameth Peter alone (saith he) and compareth him vnto himselfe, because he had receiued the primacie to build the Church; that himselfe likewise is chosen to haue the primacie of building the Churches of the Gentiles. Yet so, that Peter preached to the Gentiles also. These are S. Ambrose his wordes.

                  Treatise of the Church some of our English Studentes and young seduced gentlemen thinke to be a treasure of great truth and wisedome. But God wil make the falsehood and folly thereof euident to all men at his good time. For this present point, that Paule was an Apostle and teacher of the Iewes and the Gentiles both, as well as Peter was, and therfore not inferior to him in this respect: the Scripture is so cléere, that no mist of Stapletons, though it were as thicke as the darkenes of Egipt, can take away the light of it. The wordes of Christ proue it, spoken (touching Paule) vnto Ananias: 
                  
                     Act. 9.15. 
                  He is a chosen vessell to me, to beare my name before the Gentiles, and kinges, and the children of Israel. The commission by Ananias sent vnto Paule: 
                  
                     Act. 22.14. 
                  The God of our Fathers hath appointed thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Iust one, and heare the voice of his mouth. For thou shalt bee his witnesse, vnto all men, of the thinges which thou hast seene and heard. Paules obedience to his calling, and performance of his duetie:

                     ver. 5. & 14. they preached the worde of God in the Synagogues of the Iewes through diuers cities and countries: vntill that 
                     ver. 45. when the Iewes did stubbernely resist the truth which

they preached, they said boldly to them, It was necessarie that the word of God should haue bene first spoken vnto you: but seeing you put it from you, and iudge your selues vnworthie of euerlasting life, lo, we turne to the Gentiles. Wherefore as 
                     Act. 8.25. & 10 28. 
                  Peter preached the Gospell both to Iewes and Gentiles: so did also Paule. As 
                     Act. 15.7. God did choose Peter, that the Gentiles by his mouth should heare the word of the Gospell: so did he choose Paule.

               Why dooth Paule then call himselfe 
                     Rom. 11.13. 1. Tim. 2.7. 2. Tim. 1.11.

               Because that when he and Peter perceiued, that God did blesse the labours of the one of them amongst the Iewes chiefly, of the other amongst the Gentiles: they agreed togither and 
                     Gal. 2.9. 
                  gaue the right handes of fellowship each to other, that Paule should preach vnto the Gentiles, & Peter to the Iewes: not so, but that either (if occasion serued) might and did preach to either, as 
                     Comment. in epist. ad Gal. cap. 2. 
                  Ambrose noted well, and 
                     Act 28.17.30. it is written of Paul namely: but that they should specially teach, the one, ye Iewes; the other, the Gentiles, as 
                     Rom. 1.13. 1. Pet. 1.1. and so forth the rest. their epistles shew they did. Thus, if you regard that, which they did chiefly: Peter was an Apostle and teacher of the Iewes, Paule of the Gentiles. If that which they might doo, and did by occasion: they were the Apostles and teachers, both of both, and so no difference betwéene them.
            
            
               Hart.
               We graunt 
                     Staplet. princ. doctr. li. 6. ca. 14. that there was no difference betwéene them, in the office of the Apostleship: for therein was Paule equall vnto Peter.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               He that granteth this, would sée, if he had eyes, that he must grant the other, which he hath denied. For, if equall in the office of the Apostleship: then equall in the charge of preaching to all nations. And if in the charge of preaching to all nations; then both to Iewes and Gentiles.
            
            
               Hart.
               It is true: to both. But so, that S. Peter was chiefe Apostle to them both, and the supreme head to rule as well S. Paule, as the rest of the Apostles.

                     Ioh. 21. ver. 15.16. & 17. saying vnto Peter, Doost thou loue me more then these? Feede my lambes. Doost thou loue me? Feede my sheepe. Doost thou loue me? Feede my sheepe. Wherein, sundry principall pointes are to be noted. First, he requireth of him an open profession and testimonie of his loue, to this intent that he may put him in trust with his flocke. Secondly, he requireth not onely that he loue him, but also that he loue him more then the rest: that to him as louing him more then ye rest, he may giue power aboue the rest. Thirdly, he asketh him thrise, if he loue him; and the former times with the word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the last with 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which noteth feruent loue. With the which worde also Peter had answered him still. Fourthly, he saith vnto him thrise also, feede. And, to passe ouer the sheepe and the lambes, whereof I spake before; fiftly, the first charge of feeding the lambes, & the last of the shéepe are vttered with the Gréeke word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  ▪ yt is, rule: to shew that the lambes, euen lay-men (as I said) are onely to be fedde; but the sheepe, I meane, Bishops and Pastors, are both to be fedde and to be ruled of Peter. Sixtly the worde, to feede, hath a great force, and signifieth a power most full and absolute: as the which implieth all other actions of ecclesiasticall regiment. For they are all directed to ye food of soules. There are obserued more such notes to like effect: but either not so pithie and sound as these are, or treated of alreadie. Wherefore I content my selfe with these sixe. Which if you lay togither, and marke what may be saide in seuerall for each of them: you haue inough to proue a great worthines of Peter, in any mans iudgement; in ours, a supremacy.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               That which is written 
                     Pro. 30.33. in the Prouerbes of Salomon, Hee that wringeth his nose causeth blood to come out: may be truely saide of the proofes which you presse out of these circumstances. The most pithie of them, if any of them haue pith, are they which touch the matter: the question, of loue required; the charge enioyned, of feeding; and each of them repeated thrise. Which all in verie truth, as Christ did vse them to Peter, were rather a stay of his weakenesse, then a marke of his worthinesse, much lesse a proofe of his supremacy. For Peter had pretended greater loue to Christ, then had the rest of the Apostles.

In so much that when Christ had told them of their frailtie, the night before his passion, 
                     Mat. 26.31. 
                  All ye wil be offended at me this night, for it is written, I will smite the shepheard and the sheepe shal be scattered: Peter answering said vnto him, though al should be offended at thee, yet will I neuer be offended. Whereto when Christ replied, verily I say vnto thee, this night before the cocke crow, thou wilt denie me thrise: Peter answered him againe, though I should dye with thee, yet will I not denie thee. This promise, as it was made by all the Apostles, but chiefely by Peter: so was it broken by them all, but chiefely by him. For they did all forsake Christ: Peter did not only forsake him, but forsweare him too. Wherefore when our Sauiour after his resurrection would gather them togither, to confirme them from their feare, and giue them power to preach the Gospell to all Nations: he, that in comforting them all (before his passion) remembred Peter chiefely as néeding it most;

                  This is my commandement that ye 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  loue one an other, as I haue 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  loued you: 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  greater loue then this hath no man, when a man bestoweth his life for his friendes. Whereas S. Iohn therefore vttered Christes demand by the one worde, and Peters answere by the other: it séemeth that he vsed the wordes indifferently, as hauing both ye same meaning. Which is proued also by the consent and iudgement of the Syriake translation, that hath the 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   same worde for them both. Howbeit if the wordes haue a difference of sense: it agreeth better with the modestie of Peter to haue saide lesse, then more, of his loue; chiefly, sith hee had fallen by saying too much of it, and had by triall felt his frailtie. But if he did answere, as you imagine him; Dost thou loue me Peter? Lord, I loue thee feruently: yet this feruent loue inferreth no supremacy ouer the rest of the Apostles. For, what he reporteth of his owne loue, the same doth Christ witnesse of theirs, or rather more, if we would pricke it vp as you doo; euen 
                     Ioh. 16.27. that his Father loueth them, because that they loued him. In both the which branches 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . that same worde is vsed, which (by your fansie) doth signifie feruent loue, when it may serue the Popes vantage.
            
            
               Hart.
               We doo not relye so much on that word, as on the other two, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , but chiefly on ye word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . For although to feed (which is meant by 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) doth import much: yet to feede and rule (which 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   signifieth) hath a greater force: as those places shew where that worde is vsed, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Psal. 2.9. Reue. 2.27. 
                  Thou shalt rule them with a rodde of yron, and, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Matt. 2.6. Mich. 5.2. 
                  he shall rule my people Israel. Wherefore Christ committed a soueraine power to Peter in that 
                     Ioh. 21. ver. 16.he said 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : not onely to feede but to rule and gouerne too.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then it was not Peters duetie to rule ye lambes but the shéepe onely. For Christ doth say 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , speaking of the shéepe: and 
                     ver. 15. of the lambes, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               Hart.
               So I said. Yet that word which he vseth of the lambes he vseth 
                     ver. 17.

                        b. 6. cap. 10. of the shéepe also. Whereby this is shewed (as I touched briefly out of 
                     o
                   D. Stapleton) that lambes must be onely

meated and fedde of Peter (through the common foode of doctrine to be looked for from 
                     Ab hoc supremo patre familias.
                   him, as supreme father of the houshold, and from his Sée,) and they must be ruled of their next and proper Pastors whom immediatly they are vnder: but sheepe, that is to say, the greater and perfiter, Bishops themselues and Pastors, are committed to him not onely to be fedde with the common doctrine, but also to be ruled 
                     Ab illo tanquam supreme pastorum pastore.
                   of him more immediatly as of the supreme Pastor of Pastors.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               So your Doctor noteth (I grant,) and you touched it. But you were best recall it, or els this fine fansie of that Gréeke word, as it is farre fetched, so will be deare bought. For it must cost the Pope halfe of his supremacy.
            
            
               Hart.
               Why doo you say so?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Why? Are not Princes comprised in the name of lambes, by your iudgement: as Bishops, and Pastors, in the name of sheepe?
            
            
               Hart.
               They are: and what then?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The Pope then hath nothing to doo with the ruling and gouerning of Princes; much lesse with deposing them. For Peter had commission (you say) to feede onely (and not to rule) the lambes.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               But they must be ruled of their next Pastors, and so, by consequent, of the Pope: because their Pastors must be ruled of him, as Pastor of Pastors.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Nay: but the Pastors are not to be ruled by the Pope neither, if this fansie hold. For in your Latin authenticall translation 
                     Ioh. 21.16. Pasce agnos, for 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . ye clawse which doth answere to ye Gréeke word hath not sheep but lambes. Whervpō 
                  The Rhemish Testament on that place in the margent. your Rhemists also note ye same as spokē of lambs, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , feed & rule. So that, howsoeuer he lay hold on others by yt Gréeke word compared with your Latin text: yet his rule & gouernment of Bishops & Pastors is shakē of therby. And this is as much as half of his supremacy: nay all, by a consequent. For his claime lieth, first, ouer Bishops: and then, by means of Bishops, ouer the whole church. Thus while you deuise by quirkes of your owne to vnderprop ye Pope, you lay him on the ground: & do him more harme by crasing of ye word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , then good by fortifying of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . For although it signifie to feede, in such sort, as shepheards do their sheepe, and so consequently to rule them, and guide them, in all respects

                  as shepheards doo, for the preseruing of them: yet that charge of ruling belonged not to Peter alone peculiarly, but was and is common vnto all shepheards. Our English toong answereth not to the felicitie of the gréeke and latin in making euident proofe hereof. For in the gréeke wordes 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , & 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and in the Latin pastor & pasco, the matter would be plainer. But yet in our English, a shepheard, and, to feede in that sort with ruling, are 
                     Coniugata.
                   yoked so togither by lincke (as I may terme it) of reason and sense, though it appeare not in lincke and likenesse of words: that as many as are called to the function of 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . shepheards and Pastors of the church, they all are bound by duetie 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   to féede and rule so. The proofe whereof we haue in Peter and Paule: who mouing the Pastors (whom they cal Elders) to attend their charge, 1. Pet. 5.1. the one beseecheth them to 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  feede the flock of God which dependeth on them: 
                  
                     Act. 20.28. the other telleth them, that the holy Ghost hath made them ouerseers 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  to feede the church of God; both vsing the same worde 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   as betokening the common charge of shepheards. 
                     Reu. 2.27. Yea Christ him selfe, speaking to the Angel, yt is, ye shepherd of ye church of Thyatira, doth promise that hee who ouercommeth and keepeth his workes vnto the ende, shall haue power giuen vnto him ouer nations, and

                     . 
                  he shall rule them with a rodde of yron. So that euen there, where you note that word importeth greatest power of beating downe the wicked: Christ applieth it to all his faithfull seruants and not to Peter onely. Wherefore, if it were so that hee had ment more by saying 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   thē by 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , in his charge to Peter: yet he meant no more then that which belongeth to euery shepheards charge for the shéepe which God ordeineth him to féede. But, in truth, if your itche of wresting holy scriptures to priuate fansies were healed; you woulde rather thinke that S. Iohn did vtter one sense with sundry wordes, as in the Lordes demaunde of Peter, Doost thou

                   as if that our Sauiour had vsed the same word, and meant the same thing in both. Which interpretation should bée

of greater credit with you in this point then it was in that, because your authenticall Latin translation which there dissented from it, agreeth with it here, expressing likewise both by pasce. Unlesse you will say that your authenticall Latin doth not expresse fully the meaning of the Gréeke.
            
            
               Hart.
               A translation cannot expresse the force alwayes of wordes in the originall: as in 
                     Prolog. in Ecclesiastic. Iesu filij Sirach.
                   
                  Ecclesiasticus it is obserued of the Hebrue.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               You say true. How much the more were they to blame 
                     Concil. Trident. Session. 4. who decréed that a translation should be accounted as authenticall 
                  
                     In publicis lectionibus, disputationibus, praedicationibus, & expositionibus.
                   
                  in all Diuinitie-exercises, and no man vnder any pretense to reiect it. But if there had bene such force and importance in the Gréeke 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : your Latin translator could haue expressed it easily. For 
                     Act. 20 28. otherwhere he doth translate it 
                     Regere ecclesiam Dei

                  to rule: and that, being spoken of meaner Pastors then Peter, euen of the Bishops of Ephesus. Which bewrayeth further the séely state of your proofe grounded on ye worde. For, if Peter were ordeined supreme head because he was willed to rule the 
                  After the Greeke text, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  sheepe or After the latin translat. agnos.
                   
                  lambes: what headship may the Bishoppes of Ephesus claime, who were made ouerseers to rule the church of God, that is both lambes and shéepe? But your last proofe vpon the word 
                     Staplet. li. 6. c. 10. Obserua vim verbi pasce, quo plenissima potestas designatur.
                   
                  to feede which signifieth (you say) a power most full and absolute, is most out of square: and neither agreeth with your selues, nor with truth and reason. For you said that lambes are onely fedde of Peter: sheepe, both fedde and ruled. Which is fond, if to rule be no more then to feede: fonder, if to feede imply a power most full and absolute. Beside that, to feede, is to nourish Christians with 
                     Hebr. 5.12. 1. Cor. 3.2. 
                  milke or strong meate according to their state, as they are either lambes or sheepe. Wherefore if that import the fulnesse of power which no man hath but one, to wéete, the supreme head: how great is your crueltie to the church of Christ, who leaue but one Pastor throughout all the earth to preach the word of God vnto it? Or if you leaue more, & grant that seuerall Churches shall haue their seuerall Pastors after the ordinance of God: how great is your folly who graunting vs so many Pastors & feeders, yet say, that one alone hath the charge to feede, and that importeth a supremacy? For if euery Pastor haue charge to feede his flocke; and to feede implieth a fulnesse of power peculiar to the supreme head: then by your reason

euerie Pastor in his church, euery feeder in his flocke, is a supreme head, no lesse then Peter was amongst the Apostles. Nay, Peter was not so, by your reason, neither. For, if to feede doo signifie a power most absolute and full, as 
                     Staplet lib. 6. cap. 10. you say it doth, and that power was giuen to all the Apostles, 
                     Stap
                           •
                        et. lib. 6. cap. 7. as you confesse too: it followeth by your owne confession and saying that all the Apostles had that charge, to feede. If all they had that charge: to feede, maketh nothing for Peters Supremacie. Wherefore this, and other of the like knottes, which Stapleton hath sought and 
                     •
                  ound out in bulrushes: they did not grow in them, by the workmanship of the Creator; man hath made them, and God will loose them.
            
            
               Hart.
               This which you haue said might séeme to be some what towardes the loosing of them:
                     The second Diuision.
                   if the scripture gaue not very cléere euidence for proofe of his Supremacie as well elsewhere as here. For Christ said to Peter, 
                  
                     Luc. 22.31. 
                  Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired you, to winow you, as wheate. But I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not. And thou being conuerted, strengthen thy brethren.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Will you be drawing still of blood? for what doth eyther Christes prayer for Peter, or the charge giuen him to strengthen his brethren, say more for his supremacie: then the question, dost thou loue me? or, the charge, feede my sheepe? vnlesse you presse violently the wordes beyond their sense, as your Schoole-diuines in their captious syllogismes (or rather sophismes) vse to doo.

                     Staplet. princ. doctr. lib. 6. cap. 8. they commande him to strengthen his brethren. And his brethen were the rest of the Apostles. They commaunde him therefore to strengthen the Apostles. If to strengthen the Apostles: then must he be their supreme head. Wherefore the wordes of Christ proue the supremacie of Peter.

               And thinke you that Christ meant the rest of the Apostles, when he saide, thy brethren?
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Whom should hee meane, if not them?
            
            
               
               Rainoldes.
               All the faithfull, as I thinke. For they haue all one 1. Pet. 1.17. 
                  Father, the same that Peter hath; and they are 1. Pet. 3.7. 
                  fellow heires of the grace of life with Peter; and Peter himselfe strengthning them, 2. Pet. 1.10. calleth them brethren. So that, in Peters iudgement, Christ seemeth to haue meant by his brethren, all the faithfull. Pardon me, if I be rather of his minde therein, then of yours.
            
            
               Hart.
               As who say we denyed that all the faithfull are meant by his brethren: 
                     Staplet. lib. 6. cap. 8. we teach the same also. Yet that is true, that I saide. For (I trust) the Apostles are in ye number of the faithfull.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               They are so. But then your reason of brethren hath no more force, then had the other of sheepe. Nay it hath lesse. For what is

                  to strengthen?
               
            
            
               Hart.
               
                  To strengthen is to stay them vp who do stand. For the function of preaching, 
                     Rom. 10.14. which through the grace of God ingendreth faith in men, hath two speciall partes, to teach, and to strengthen: or, as S. Paule speaketh, 1. Cor. 3.6. 
                  to plant and to water. To teach and to plant, is to conuert men vnto the faith of Christ, and to ingraffe them into him. To strengthen and to water is to vphold them which are already faithfull, that they may perseuere in it.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then is the charge lesser, to strenghthen the brethren, then to feede the sheepe. For to feede, is as much, as to preach the word of God. And, to preach, hath two dueties: to raise vp them that are fallen, to strengthen them that do stand. Wherefore if the supremacie were not giuen Peter by the charge, to feede the sheepe: much lesse can it be giuen by a part of that charge, to strengthen the brethren. For as Peter ought that duetie to his brethren: so did his brethren to him, and 
                     Gal. 2.14. 
                  Paule performed it; so did the Apostles to their brethren, and 
                     Act. 15.41. Rom. 1.11. 1. Pet. 5.12. Iude. 3. &c.
                   they paid it; so do 1. Thess. 5.1
                        •
                     . 
                  all the faithfull, euery one to his brethren (according to that measure of grace, which God hath giuen them) 
                     Rom. 12.5. 1. Cor. 12.25. as being all members of the same bodie, and therefore ech to helpe other. Our 
                     Polydor. Virgil hist. Angl. libr. 8. English Chronicles haue a story of king Edward the Confessor, and Godwin Earle of Kent: that, when they were sitting at table togither, Harald the kinges cup-bearer, the Earles sonne, did stumble so with one foote, that he was downe almost, but recouering him selfe with ye other foote, he neither fell, nor shed the drinke. Whereat when the Earle smiled, and said,

                  now one brother helped an other: the king calling to mind his brother Alfreds death, whom the Earle had slaine, beheld him with a displeased countenance, and said, So might my brother also haue holpen me, if thou hadst not beene. In the which storie, the cup-bearer who stumbled, doth shew that one foote may strengthen an other, and stay them both that they fall not: the Earle, who obserued therein a brothers duetie, doth shewe, that the younger may strengthen the elder, or the elder the yoongger: the king, who remembred his owne estate by it, doth shewe that the inferior may strengthen the superior, yea the member the head. By the proportion of which pointes a man of reason may see, that an equall in all respectes may strengthen an equall: that, amongst vnequalles, the left may strengthen the right, and the right the left: yea, that an arme, that a foote may strengthen the head, and saue it perhaps from taking such a fall, as would crush it in péeces. Wherefore the charge of Peter, to strengthen his brethren, is no sufficient proofe that he was made head of the meanest amongst the faithfull: much lesse of the Pastors whom 1. Pet. 5.1. he calleth his fellow-elders; and least of al of the Apostles, 
                     Mat. 28.19. whose commission was the same with his to all nations.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               It is true that others may strengthen their brethren, as members of the same bodie: but Christ commaundeth Peter to do it as their head. Which may be gathered 
                     Staplet. lib. 6. cap. 8. by the occasion, whereon the wordes were spoken. For, when there arose a strife among the Apostles which of them should seeme to bee the greatest: Christ said vnto them, 
                     Luc. 22.25. 
                  The kingesof the Gentiles do raigne ouer them; but you not so, and so forth: teaching them, that 
                     Omnem dominandi appetitum ac libidinem.
                   all desire and lust of raigning ought to bee farre from his ministers.

                        iter prohibuisse aut abstulisse videretur.
                   Yet least he should séeme thereby to haue forbidden withall, or taken away all power of raigning from them: he added those wordes spoken to Peter onely; plainly declaring that he should be the greatest, which was the matter where about they striued.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  Cato said 
                     Cic. de diuination. lib. 2. that he marueiled, that a Sooth-sayer did not laugh when he saw a Sooth-sayer. Me thinkes, the professors of your diuinitie should laugh, when they sée one an other. For, they proue the pointes of their Popish doctrine by as strong reasons: as the Sooth sayers vsed to proue their diuinations by the liuer, and the hart, and other entralles of beastes.

But children are perswaded, when they heare a ring of belles that the belles speake whatsoeuer they haue fansied, at least, like vnto it. The Lord, when the Apostles did striue about dominion and superioritie, told them, that none of them should be amongst the rest, as kinges amongst the Gentiles: yet least he should seeme withall to haue forbidden all dominion amongst them, he appointed Peter to be their supreme head. Thus saith the Soothsayer. But what saith the Scripture? In effect the cleane contrary. For it sheweth, that Christ 
                     Luc. 22. ver. 2
                        •
                     . hauing reproued them for striuing who should be the greatest, and thirsting to be Lordes after the maner of earthly kinges:

                     6. taught them, that an humbling of them selues to their brethren, and a desire to do good by seruing ech of other, must be the preeminence that they should seeke, as 
                     ver. 27. he had done. And as 
                     ver. 28. they had béene partakers of his troubles, so 
                     ver. 29. had he appointed to them a kingdome also: 
                     ver. 30. to make them partakers of that blisse and glory, in which he should raigne him selfe, as king of kinges, & they (as counsellors about him) sitting on 
                  
                     Mat. 19.28. 
                  twelue thrones to iudge the twelue tribes of Israel. Now the former part of this spéech of Christ debarreth the Apostles all from that supremacie (of 
                     Sanctissimus Dominus noster Papa.
                   
                  our most holy Lord the Pope) which you would put on Peter. The later hath greater coulour for his dreame, who saith, that Christ remoued 
                  
                     Omnem dominandi appetitum ac libidinem.
                   
                  all lust of raigning ftom his ministers, and

                  not all power of raigning; because it mentioneth a kingdome yt 
                  Christ appointed for them. But this importeth rather an equalitie of Peter with the rest of the Apostles: sith the state is commō, and thrones are giuen to thē al. Or if there might be euen so notwithstanding a superioritie, as at a councell table there must néedes be, in sitting one before an other: yet is that nothing vnto that supremacie which you claime for Peter. For, to serue your purpose, Christ should haue said, that he would establish them all in seates of honour: but Peter in a throne like 1. King. 10.18.

First, in the common danger of all, he strengthneth Peter onely: Satan hath desired you, to winow you as wheat: but I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not. Then, least that strengthning should séeme to haue bene made for Peters owne sake alone, or in respect of his personall faith, he addeth, And thou being conuerted strengthen thy brethen: shewing that he is strengthned in the faith, to the end he might strengthen the faith of all others, as who should be afterward the Pastor of them all.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               It were a néedlesse labour for me to spend words in these your two pointes, if you had marked that which hath bene saide alreadie. For I shewed that the former argueth his weaknesse; the later openeth his duetie; but neither proueth any preeminence at all, saue a preeminence in frailtie. The truth is, that Christ in those wordes dooth thrée things: whereof one is a byle, and therefore you touch it not. For in the danger of them all, but greatest danger of Peter, he putteth him in minde Satan hath desired to winow you, as wheate. first of his fall, to humble him; I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not. then of his rising, to comfort him; And thou being conuerted, strengthen thy brethren. last, of his duetie to quicken him vnto it. His fall; to coole the heate of 
                     Theophylact. in Luc. 23. 
                  pride and

                  vaine glorie, (may I so terme it with the Fathers?) wherein hee presumed, 
                     Matth. 26.33. more then the rest did, of his faith and constancy. His rising; that he should not despaire when he had fallen. For though he dealt vnfaithfully, denying Christ thrise: yet his faith should not faile, because 
                     Ioh. 11.42. 
                  he (whom God doth alwayes heare) had praied for him. His duetie; that being raised vp againe he should strengthen his brethren: as hauing learned by experience both to haue compassion of the infirmitie of men & to preach the goodnes and mercy of God. The last point, of his duetie, was common to him (as I haue shewed) with the Apostles: and therefore proueth no preeminence of supreme headship. The first, of his fall, proueth a kinde of preeminence; but in the denying of Christ aboue others: which Popes haue

best right to, but they doo not claime it. The other, of his rising, insueth and dependeth on that of his fall: wherin, sith he specially would sinne more then the rest, and so his danger be more speciall, and therefore néede more speciall succour; Christ said to him in speciall, But I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not. For Christ prayed the same for all his Apostles in sense, though not in word, by that solemne

                     Luc. 15.22.31. wil cheare him vp beside the rest; & a good Physition hath care of all ye bodie, but applieth plaisters to ye part affected: so Christ, to helpe Peter, who was to be distressed & diseased most, encouraged him with this comfort, yt 
                  his faith should not faile; and laide that salue of Gods assured fauour on the sore of distrust that might afflict his minde. Now, this care and wisedome of a father and a Physition doth shew (for the childe & part whereto they tender it) not, that they be in greater honor then the rest, but that they stand in greater néede. The wordes of Christ therefore spoken vnto Peter, I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not: doo proue that he stood in greater danger then the rest, not that he was in greater dignitie.

               Nay, I may rather aske: good Lord, what meane you so to doo? For, as Amnon, enamoured of his sisters beautie, ensnaring her by fraude, did force her to his lust, and after

                     ver. 16. 
                  this euill was greater then the other, which he had done vnto her: so the Pope enflamed with loue of the church, entrapping her with guile and vsing violence vnto her, doth cast her out of doores by giuing this as proper, first to Peter, then to him selfe, that Christ prayed for him, that his faith should not faile. Wherein I haue this reason to say, that he doth greater euill vnto the church, then was the other which he did: because in the other she had this comfort left, that the transgression was rather his, who did, then hers, who suffered force: in this he taketh from her all comfort of her misery, and maketh her ashamed to cast her eyes on God or man. For what is the comfort of the Churche of Christ, the faithfull, and elect, but that

               Why? Dare you deny that Christ spake to Peter, and to Peter onely, when he said, 
                     Luc. 22, 31. 
                  Simon, I haue prayed for thee that thy faith should not faile? Dooth not the very text of the Gospell shew it?

                     Matt. 9.2. 
                  Sonne, be of good comfort, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee? Dooth not the verie text of the Gospell shewe it?

                  Let thy conuersation be without couetousnesse, for he hath saide, I will not faile thee nor forsake thee: doo I take this comfort of the prouidence of God from euery other Christian, because I assure it to one in particular? Or did the Apostle ouershoote himselfe, in saying that to all the faithful which God said to Ioshua: 
                  
                     Ios. 1.5. 
                  I will not leaue thee, nor forsake thee? You haue your choyce, take which you list: either acquit vs, or condemne him. For if Christ meant to assure the faith of none but of Peter, because he said to him, I haue prayed for thee that thy faith should not faile: then did God promise his gratious assistance to none but to Ioshua, when he said to him, I will not leaue thee nor forsake thee: and 
                     Hebr. 13.5. the Apostle erred in saying it to all Christians. If the Apostle saide that to all Christians by the spirit of truth: then is it true in like sort, that it may be said to any childe of God, whom Satan hath desired to sift and shake (as he did Peter,) and made him to denie Christ; Be of good comfort, for he hath said, I haue prayed for thee that thy faith should not faile. And if it may be said to any childe of God: then was it verified in all the Apostles,

               Rainoldes.
               It is a question. For if Christ made him supreme head by those wordes: then the supreme head denyed Christ, and that often, and that with an oth too. Whereof a very daungerous conclusion would folowe, that the Pope may erre, yea (that is more) deny Christ.
            
            
               Hart.
               I say not that Christ made him supreme head at that present time: but prepared him (as it were) to make him supreme head after. As D.

               You haue said. And your Doctor hath shewed, herein, a point of greater wit then many of his felowes. But as of greater wit, so of greater spite, in adding thereunto (that, which now I touched) 
                     Lib. 6. cap. 8. that Caluin made no mention at all of those wordes, because he knew well that (they are so singular for Peters supremacie) they could not possibly bee auoided. For 
                     Institut. religion. Christ. lib. 4. cap. 7. sect. 27. & 28. 
                  Caluin doth mention them in treating of the point whether the Pope may erre. And your Doctor witnesseth him selfe that directly they concerne that point: the supremacie, but by an inkling. The strength thereof then, as touching the supremacie, doth rest vpon that, whereof they giue inkling it should be done after: that is, vpon the charge of feeding lambes and sheepe. But it is proued that Christ gaue no more to Peter, in that, then to the rest of the Apostles. It is proued therefore, that ye wordes of Christ [strengthen thy brethren] do raise no higher throne for Peter then for them. Much lesse, if the prayer that Christ made for Peter were common vnto him with all faithfull Christians, and not with the Apostles onely. Wherefore this reason, which is so strong in your eies, must be strengthned by his brethren, if he haue any. For sure he is a great deale too weake to strengthen them.

               Hart.
               There are many places, but specially, two: by which Peters soueraintie ouer the Apostles is manifestly shewed. For in 
                     Act. 1.15. the one, he proposeth an election to bee made of a new Apostle into the roome of Iudas. In 
                     Act. 15.7. the other, he is President of the Councell of the Apostles, which was held at Ierusalem: he speaketh first, and concludeth in it. Out of both the which I gather this reason. S. Peter did practise the power and authoritie of a supreme head ouer the Apostles. Therefore hee was their supreme head.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Now are you come to that, which I had an eye too, when I desired you (in 
                     Chap. 1. Diuis. 2. the beginning of our conference) to tell me what power you gaue vnto the Pope by calling him supreme head. For, in this grasse there lurketh a snake. Which that you may see, and (if it be the gratious will of God) auoide, least that you perish through his venoom: I will aske you a question. When you say,

head of ecclesiasticall iudgement, and President of Councels: doo you meane that the Pope in assemblies of Bishops, is, as the Speaker (with vs) in the Parlament, to propose matters to them, and aske their iudgementes, and gather their voices, that thinges may bee orderly handled and enacted by common consent?

               Yea, I say to you, and more then the Prince. For as thinges in Parlament cannot bee enacted without the Princes consent: so neither can the Prince make actes without consent of the Lordes and Commons. And when they are made by consent of them all▪ they cannot be repealed by the Prince alone, without the like consent by which they were made. But with the Pope it is not so. For such is the power of his Princely prerogatiue, that not onely Councels may not make decrées for the Church-gouernment without his consent: but hee may also make decrées without them, as good as they with him. Yea, that he may adde too, and take from, and alter what hee shall thinke good in the decrées of Councels▪ and set them out for theirs,

                   as Pope Clemens played with the Councell of Vienna.

Now, sith that the power which you giue the Pope by the name of supreme head, you giue it Peter too, from whom you fetch the Popes conueiance; and Peter in the assemblies of the Apostles, was but as the Speaker, and therefore not as the Prince, and therefore not as more then the Prince in our Parlament: hereof I conclude, that Peter was not the supreme head of the Apostles. And so haue you the third point, 
                     Chap. 3. Diuis. 1. which I promised to proue, that if somewhat more were giuē to Peter thē to the rest of the Apostles, yet was it not so much as should make him their supreme head.

               Rainoldes.
               What néede I? When your selfe gaue no more vnto him, then as the Speakers office, in the former assembly: wherein yet he did most. For you said, 
                     Petrus proponit faciendam furrogationem noui Apostoli. Staplet. lib. 6. cap. 13. that he proposed an election to be made of a new Apostle into the roome of Iudas. And this was all that you might say, and say truely, by the story of the Actes. Which sheweth, that not he, but

                   the election: so farre as it was lawfull for them to deale with that which God was to order extraordinarilie. As for the other assembly, when the Councel was held at Ierusalem: you cannot proue that he had so much as the office of a Speaker therein. Your 
                     Staplet. lib. 6. cap. 13. Doctor infeoffeth him (I graunt) with more: namely, that

                  hee speaketh first of all, concludeth, yea, and is President too. But what will not he dare to affirme? who, in so great light of the Scriptures, affirmeth in writing that which is flat against them. For he saith that Peter not only speaketh first, but concludeth also. And they shewe that both

                     . there had beene much debating and reasoning of the matter, before Peter spake: and after he had spoken,

                  the Councell did conclude the matter. Yea they did conclude it according to the very wordes that Iames spake, and 
                     ver. 29. a speciall point of his, which Peter touched not. So that, if we would striue but lawfully against yt, for which you striue vnlawfully:
                     ver. 20. the likely-hood is rather that Iames sat as President in the Coū
                  cell, then Peter, sith both he spake last and the whole Councell did conclude with him. But, to yéeld vnto you (for your most aduantage) as much or more then any likely-hood may afford you, yt Peter was not only the Speaker but ye President in both ye assemblies: yet are you no néerer vnto yt supremacy which you shoote at. For, such a Presidentship as Peter had amongst ye Apostles, is so farre from the Prelatship which the Pope seeketh to haue amongst Bishops: that, if we should offer him all that Peter had (at your request) vpon condition that he would accept it and aske no more then it: he would thinke we mocked him, and giue you litle thankes who take vpon you to be his aduocate, & make so poore a plea for him. This you may perceiue by an other aduocate, who made ye same plea for him out of this storie, a learned

Lawier, Francis Duaren. He (in 
                     De sacr. eccle minister. ac benefic. lib. 3. cap. 2. his Abridgement of the Canon lawe) falling into the question of the Pope and the Councell, whither of them is soueraine, and hath the chiefest power, whereto the other should be subiect in matters of the Church: doth thus set downe his iudgement of it. It seemeth most agreeable to the law of God, that the Church (which the Councell doth represent) should haue the chiefest power, and the Pope should acknowledge himselfe subiect to it. For the power of binding and loosing was giuen by Christ not to Peter alone (whose successour the Pope is said to be) but 
                  
                     Matt. 18. c. Quodcunque. 24. q. 1. 
                  to the whole Church. Howbeit, I deny not, but Peter was set ouer the rest of the Apostles. Hereof it commeth that in the time of the Apostles 
                  
                     Act. 1. & 6. & 15. 
                  as often as any was to be ordeined either Bishop or Deacon, or any thing to bee decreed which appertained to the Church: Peter neuer tooke that vpon himselfe, but permited it to the whole Church. This was in him aboue the rest, that he was wont, 
                  
                     Tanquam princeps Apostolorum.
                   
                  as chiefe of the Apostles, to call them togither, and propose to them the thinges, which were to bee doone. Euen as now

Yet is he not therefore greater or higher then is the whole court: neither hath hee power ouer all the Senatours; neyther may hee decree any thing against their iudgements: nay the iudgement of all controuersies belongeth to the court (

               What tell you me of Francis Duaren, whose authoritie I regard not, nor am to be pressed with it? Chiefly, sith hée was a Lawier, not a Diuine: and whither he were a Catholike or no, I know not. I will proue by the ancient and holy learned fathers, that Peter had a full and perfit supremacy ouer the Apostles, in those two places of the Actes.

               I did not take Duaren for the strength of mine answere, but the holy scriptures, the same that you alleaged. By the text and circumstances whereof, I made it plaine, that Peter had no higher power in the assemblies of the Apostles: thē hath either the Speaker of our English Parlament, or, (to make the most of it) the President of a court of Parlament in France, which is Duarenes similitude. Howbeit, if I should haue vsed his authoritie to confirme it, as well as I alleaged his wordes to open it: you might not reiect such a man so lightly. For

Beside, he wrote that treatise to instruct students in the Canon law, which is the fortresse of the Papacy: and he so deliuereth the chiefest pointes of it, that Lawiers amongst ye Protestants were offended &

For if a man kéepe within any bounds of modestie and truth, & will not runne headlong with you through thicke & thin: you will account of him, either as an Hereticke, or as one that sauoureth of heresie at least. But who are the Fathers, whom you pretend against Duaren, to proue your supremacy out of those places of the Actes?

                  Chrysostome, entreating of the fact of Peter how he proposed the election of a new Apostle into the roome of Iudas: Beholde, saith he, the zeale of Peter. How hee doth acknowledge the flocke committed to him by Christ? How he is the chiefe in this assembly: and euery where beginneth to speake first of all? Afterward he prayseth Peter for dooing all thinges by the common aduise and iudgement of the Disciples, nothing by his owne authoritie. Yet that Peter might haue chosen an Apostle, yea, alone, without them, he affirmeth plainely. What, saith he, was it not lawfull for Peter himselfe to choose him? yes, it was lawfull, no doubt. But he dooth it not, least that he should seeme to gratifie any man. Then he praiseth the modestie of the rest of the Disciples: Consider, saith hee, how they graunt the seate to him (that is, the primacy, as 
                     In Matthaeum homil. 51. otherwhere he calleth it,) neither doubt they any longer, debating amongest themselues, (to wit as they did once, when Christ conuersed with them) which of them should bee the greatest. This is S. Chrysostomes iudgement of that place, which I alleaged out of the first chapter of the Actes of the Apostles for the supremacy of Peter.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               This testimonie of Chrysostome dooth stand on two branches: the one, what Peter doth, as the Scripture sheweth; the other, what he might haue done, as Chrysostome supposeth. That which Peter dooth, is granted. But it proueth not the supremacy. He remembreth his duetie; hee speaketh first of all; he doth all things by the common aduise and iudgement of the Disciples, and nothing by his owne authoritie. Thus much I saide of Peter, and did explane it out of Duaren.
                  
In Duaren you thought that it made against you, and therefore refused him. Dooth it make for you, when it is in Chrysostome, that you bring him against Duaren? Or, is this the reason, why you accept the one and refuse the other, because the wordes of Chrysostome yelding a certaine primacy to Peter, may deceiue the simple, as though he meant that primacy which you call the supremacy: but the wordes of Duaren put so plaine a difference betwéene the two primacies, that, which Peter had; and the other which the Pope hath, or would haue; that a blinde man may sée that Peters primacy was not a Popes supremacy. Which shall appeare 
                     Chapt. 5. Diuision 3. farther (if God will) by those thinges, that the Fathers speake touching Peters primacy. And thus your proofe faileth in that which the scripture sheweth that Peter doth. Now that, which Peter might haue done, as Chrysostome supposeth, woulde inferre a greater primacy then Peter had, if it were true. But the scripture saith it not. Wherfore as the

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to confute the aduersaries with whom they had to deale, & in these they erre sometimes and gather amisse: likewise may I say that they write some thinges, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to praise the Saintes of God, and stirre vp others to their vertue,

                   wherein if their wordes should be rigorously sifted, the truth is sometimes ouerlashed. So 
                     In Act. cap. 15. homil. 33. 
                  Chrysostome (in the other place which you alleage out of the Actes) to commend the mildnesse and wisedome of Iames, who left the sharper speeches to be vsed of Peter, and vsed himselfe the gentler, doth speake of him as being aboue Peter in power: and here to commend the modestie of Peter, because that hee did all things by the common aduise and iudgement of his brethren, hée saith (by the way of amplification) that Peter might himselfe haue chosen an Apostle, which yet he did not.

                  , to praise the saintes of God. Such colours you cast vpon it. But Chrysostome saith expressely, that Peter himselfe (that is to say, alone) might haue chosen him, if he would. And you (with smoother wordes, but in plaine effect) replie, that he lyeth. Doo Fathers praise the Saintes so?

so that he do it with modestie. If any kéepe not this, you say he raileth at the Fathers. Of me, who would kéepe it, you say I cast colours. What shall I do to please you?

               You shall please me, if you dissent not from them, but onely in such thinges as be knowne truthes. Which is another rule of ours, if you remember it.

               I remember it well: and herein I haue kept it. For it is a truth and a knowne truth, that the Fathers write, in fauour of the Saintes, some thinges which ouerlash the truth, if a man examine and trie them by the touch-stone. Peter himselfe shall be the Saint, in whose example I will shew it.

Wherefore sith it is known by the word of truth, that Christ called Peter Satan, that Peter denyed Christ, that Paule withstood and reproued Peter; and it may be knowne by the writtnges of the Fathers, how they vary from this truth in fauour of S. Peter, that, by washing out the spottes which seeme to staine him, his praise may be the more glorious: I hope, I might take it for a knowne truth, that the Fathers write some thinges 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , to praise the Saintes of God: wherein, if their wordes be sifted precisely, they ouerlash the truth sometimes. In saying whereof if you thinke I cast colours, and vse wordes too smooth: I can amend that faulte with speaking more roughly, as

                  Verely, I say to thee, this night before the cocke crow, thou shalt denye me thrise. Behold what he saith, thou shalt denye me, not, the man. Or if S. Ieroms words be too smooth also, I can speake more roughly yet with 
                     In Luc. cap. 22▪
                   
                  Theophylact: who saith that they who make that defense of Peter, doo make

                  a foolish defense. Thus if you compare my words with Theophylacts, & Ieroms, I vsed modestie: if with that which other of the Fathers write, I did it in a knowne truth, when I dissented from Chrysostom. Doo I please you now?

voice therin. Wherefore, if you haue Fathers in such regard, as you pretend, and do rather follow the consent of many, then the mind of one (which is 
                     Chap. 2. Diuis. 2. your owne rule) in exposition of scriptures: you must yéeld that Peter might not haue done that which Chrysostom saith, he might; vnlesse, you will say, that he might do that, whereof he was commanded and taught the contrary by God. But, if this opinion be so rooted in you, that reason cannot wéede it out: wonder not at me who, beside the scripture, haue Fathers more then you haue, and therefore (by your iudgement) the exposition of the Fathers. Wonder at your selfe: who hauing neither of them stand against them both. Wonder at your Doctor: who hauing vndertaken to proue the Supremacie by that, which Peter did in the Actes of the Apostles, telleth what he might haue done by Chrysostomes supposall. Wonder at your Pope: who building on the word, not of God, but of man, and finding mans foundation ouer-weake too, doth not practise that which Chrysostome commendeth in the fact of Peter, but doth chalenge that which Chrysostome imagineth of the right of Peter.
            
            
               Hart.
               If Peter would not vse his owne right, of modestie: his fact doth not bind the Pope (his successor) but that he may vse it.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               That refuge will not serue, vnlesse you proue two things, whereof neither is true. One, that this soueraintie was the right of Peter: an other, that the Pope succeedeth him in all his right. By the way, what soeuer you déeme of his right: you graunt that he doth not succéed him in modestie.

               It is not expedient for him to doo in euery thing as Peter did.

                   But, that he succeedeth Peter in all his right: I will proue then, when I haue proued Peters right. Now, that this soueraintie was the right of Peter, and that he had as full power in the assemblies of the Apostles, as the Prince hath in a Parlament, or the Pope in a Councell: S. Chrysostomes wordes were not all so pregnant vpon the first of the Actes 
                     Staplet. princ. doctr. l. 6. c. 14. as S. Ieroms are vpon the fiftéenth, to proue it inuincibly. For 
                     Epist. 11. inter epist. August.
                   he teacheth plainly that Peter was the first man who gaue the sentence: which sentence being followed and approued by the rest, was concluded and published in the name of the whole Councel, both of the head and of the bodie. 
                     Audito Petro tacuit omnis multitudo.

               In déede I saw not whence you could frame a proofe. Beare with mine ouersight. The silence of the multitude was fitter stuffe for it. For all sortes of men do know by experience, Princes and Counsailours in matters of State, Nobles and Commons in the houses of Parlament, Citizens and Townsmen in their common assemblies, our Students of vniuersities, both publikely in conuocations, and priuately in their colleges: that he is not alwaies aboue the rest in power, whose sentence al the rest agrée vnto in consultation. But if your frends M. Hart, haue done you such iniury, that (by meanes they sent you vntimely beyond sea) you are become a straunger in things of common sense, & humanity, at home: yet you haue read (I trust) the story of the Actes, out of the which you reason; and God hath furnished you with giftes of witte and memory to vnderstand it, and remember it. Tell me, do you thinke, that

               Yet when 
                     ver. 33. the hie Priest, and Councell did consult to kil the Apostles:

                     . they agreed to him. If a Supremacie grow not hereof to Gamaliel: why should it to Peter? If it do to Peter: why not to Gamaliel? Is this the inuincible proofe that you did promise? When they had heard Peter, they all agreed to him: therefore he was their supreme head?

               Be it whose soeuer. Sée you not what foloweth thereof, that euery Bishop in his owne diocese is aboue ye Pope? For, if aboue Peter, aboue an Apostle, aboue a chiefe Apostle: much more aboue a Bishop of Rome, or any other. You were better say that Chrysostome did erre, then fall into this perill. And in déede, (to helpe you in a point of truth) hée that maketh Iames a Bishop of one Citie, whom Christ made an Apostle to all the Nations of the earth: dooth bring him out of the hall (as they say) into the kitchin. It séemeth that Chrysostome spake it vpon the word of Clemens:

                     . 
                  did giue it to the rest of the Apostles. Which tale is flat repugnant to the worde of truth: wherein wee reade that

                  Chrysostom allowed that [they say,] and supposed Iames to be a Bishop properly: then his words haue so much the greater importance against your supremacy; séeing that they giue the principalitie to Iames in his owne dioces, and that aboue Peter. Howbeit, I will not take this aduantage: because I know that neither Peter, nor Iames gaue the definitiue sentence; but when they had spoken their mindes of the matter, 
                     Act 15. vers. 23. & 23. & 28. the Councell did define it and decrée it with common iudgement.

               They did it with common iudgement, I deny not. But Theodoret sheweth, that Peter as a Prince had a great prerogatiue therein aboue the rest: yea, gaue definitiue sentence, to which the rest consented, and as it were, subscribed. For he (in an epistle which he wrote to Leo) affirmeth that Paul did runne to great Peter, to bring a resolution from him vnto them, who contended at Antioche about the obseruation of the lawe of Moses.

a fansie (perhaps) towardes Peter: in like sort Theodoret, séeking to get the fauour of Leo bishop of Rome (whose help he stode in neede of,) did serue his owne cause, in saying, that Paul ranne to great Peter, that so he might run much more to great Leo. Which words to haue issued out from that humor: his commentaries on the Scriptures (where he sought the trueth, and folowed the text) shewe.

                  had a resolution from them of the question about the keping of the law. Howbeit if Theodorets words vnto Leo suffered no exceptiō: the most were, that Peter pronounced the definitiue sentence, as President; not gaue it, as Prince. But the Scripture it selfe (by the rule whereof his wordes must be tryed) maketh no more for Peters Presidentshippe then for Iames: and whosoeuer were President, it sheweth that neither Iames, nor Peter, but the Councel gaue the definitiue sentence. So well it proueth that, which you vndertooke to proue concerning Peter: that he had as ful power in the assemblies of the Apostles, as the Prince hath in a parlament, yea, or the pope in a Councell.

                   For the singular power of Peter is declared also by S. Paul in that he saith to the Galatians, 
                     Gal. 1.18. 
                  Then after three yeares I came to Ierusalem to see Peter, and taried with him fifteene dayes.

                  The singular power of Peter? In which words? By what reason? Because hee went to Ierusalem to see him? Or because he went after three yeares? Or because hee stayed with him fifteene dayes?

               Hart.
               Will you graunt all that, which I alleaged out of the Fathers? then will you grant that Protestants are in an error: and the truth is ours. For they auouch plainely the primacie of Peter, and call him, the mouth, the prince, the toppe of the Apostles.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Alas, you were agreed (me thought) to go through with the scripture first, & afterward come to the Fathers. I wisse they will giue you small cause of triumphing ouer the Protestants, when you shall bring their forces out into the field, and see with whom they ioine, with you, or with vs. But of the rest then. Now I graunt you so much, as doth concerne the point, for proofe whereof you cited them: namely, that Paule went to see Peter for a reuerent respect and honor of his person. But I deny the argument, which you inferre thereof, that Peter had therefore a singular power, whereby you meane the supremacie. You should haue laid the Fathers (if you would néedes bestow them) on this which is denied, not on that which is graunted. But this is the world. Men will rather giue to the rich, who need not, then to the poore who need.
            
            
               Hart.
               I thought you would rather haue denied that, then this: for this is cléere of it selfe; and néedeth no proofe. The common

vse of men sheweth it. For they giue honor and reuerence to them, in whom they acknowledge a superioritie▪
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Perhaps, a superioritie: yet not a supremacie.
            
            
               Hart.
               If Peter were Paules superior in power: the supremacie is proued.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               If in power: you say somewhat. Though neuerthelesse he might be full hie in power, and yet come short of your supremacie. But he was superior to him in some things els, and not in power.
            
            
               Hart.
               That he was superior to him in power: I proue. S. Peter had honor giuen to him of Paule: therefore he was in power aboue him.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Euill newes for husbandes, that haue shrewes to their wiues, if this argument be good. For 1. Pet. 3.7. they are commaunded to giue honor to the woman as to the weaker vessell: whereof (by your Logicke) the wiues may claime authoritie and power aboue their husbandes. S. Peter saw not this consequence: he did not thinke on his supremacie. For although he teach, that the husband should giue honor to his wife, yet he calleth the wife the weaker vessell, not the stronger: and 1. Pet. 3.1, he commandeth wiues to be subiect to their husbands, that is, to be inferior (I trow) in power vnto them. Which S. 1. Cor. 11.10. Paule noteth also more expressely, when he saith, the woman ought to haue power vpon her head.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               This answere doth not weaken the strength of mine argument. For the name of honor, when husbandes are commanded to giue it to their wiues, is taken improperly. But honor, as I take it, as Paule gaue it to Peter, is vsed in his proper sense: to signifie a reuerence, the which an inferior doth owe to a superior, a subiect to him that is in power aboue him.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The honor which husbands are bound to giue vnto their wiues, as to the weaker vessels, doth signifie an honest care and regard of bearing with their weakenes, prouiding for their wantes, and shewing all husbandly loue and duetie to them. Such a reuerence as you mention it doth not signifie, I graunt: yet doth it signifie a reuerence which is implied in the loue and duetie that their husbands owe them. 
                     Tim. 3.3. 
                  S. Paule saith to Timothee: honor the widowes, which are widowes in deede.
                  
He meaneth that they should be charitably relieued: but this reliefe is no reason, why they should not reuerently bee regarded too. For you are deceiued, if you thinke, that none are bound to reuerence others, but onely the inferiors their superiors in power. The Gentiles were taught by nature it selfe, that a reuerence is due to euery state of men: 
                     Maxima debetur puero reuerentia. Iuuenal. Satyr. 14. 
                  to children, with an héed that no vnhonest thing be done in their presence, because their tendernes is proue to learne it;

                  to old men, with an honor, in respect of their wisedome, their experience, their grauitie, wherewith the gray heares are wont to be accompanied;

                  to all, but chiefly to the best, with a modest account of their good opinion, and an honest desire to be approued of them. Wherefore if your argument do stand vpon the proper signification of honour: you shall perceiue your selfe, that it can neuer proue a supremacie of power. For honour, is an outward profession and testimonie of a reuerent opinion, which we haue conceiued of some kind of excellencie in him to whom we giue it. So, the chiefest honor is due vnto 
                     Reu. 7.12. God, the father of lightes, the fountaine of all excellencie: and after him to men, in seuerall degrees, according to their seuerall estates and giftes of excellencie wherewith the Lord hath blessed them: to 1. Pet. 2.17.

And hereby appeareth the weakenes of your argument: that Paule was inferior to Peter in power, because hee gaue him honour. Did not 1. King. 2.19. 
                  Salomon in his maiestie giue honor to his mother? and was not he the king, and she a subiect to him? Are we not all taught 
                     Rom. 12.10. to go one before an other in giuing honour, as well the rich as the poore, as well the high as the lowe? What a proud and arrogant mind had

                   did honour him. Paule therefore might haue beene aboue Peter in power, though hee did honour Peter. If he might: the honour, which hee gaue to Peter, dooth strike no stroke for the supremacie. Wherefore you may dimisse it as a coward out of the field, not fitte to fight the Popes battailes.

My former wordes, of the Apostles as being equall in power, agrée well with these of Peter and Paule. For I say not, that Paule was aboue Peter, but that he might haue bene aboue him in power, for all the honour which he gaue him. And this is sufficient to ouerthrowe your reason. But if my example of the Pope and Emperour did cause you to mistake me: you may take an other and fitter for ye purpose, the Colledge Apostolike, as Pope Pius the second. Sacrar. cerem. lib. 1. sect. 8. the Pope dooth call them, I meane the Cardinalles of Rome. Who, though they be in states, orders, and liuings, one aboue an other: 
                     Lib. 3. sect. 1. yet 
                     Cardinales intersese & gestis & verbis & nutu summam exhibent reuerentiam: stando, sedendo, eundo, equitando, & in rebus omnibus alter alteri deferendo.
                   
                  in all things, and with all curtesies they all giue hie reuerence one vnto an other. And when any of them doth come into the

chappell of the Popes holinesse to say his deuotions, he turneth towardes the Cardinalles of his owne order, and goeth not directly to his own place, vnlesse he be the lowest: but beginning at the lowest, 
                  
                     Quasi ibi remanere velit.
                   
                  as though he wold abide there, he is desired & entreated of euery one to go higher, vntil hee come directly to his own place, vnlesse he be the lowest: & himselfe 
                  
                     Modesté: semel atque iterum.
                   
                  (demurely, once, & again) desireth him, who is next vnto him, that he will go before him; & 
                  
                     Tandem in locum suum residet.
                   
                  at lēgth he sitteth down in his place. This is a foule trouble to make so much adoo at the comming in of euerie Cardinall to prayers: chiefly, when prayers are begun. Yet to shew how modestly they thinke of themselues, and how they honour one an other, 
                     Hoc idem facit quotiescunque aliquis venit postalios, praesente vel absente Pontifice.
                   
                  euery one (that commeth after others) dooth it, whither the Pope be there or no. Out of doubt, Cardinalles, men of such wisedome, would not commit this folly, if euery one whom they honour must be aboue them in power. But you deale iniuriously with me, to say, that you framed your reason out of the scriptures and Fathers, and I bring the booke of Ceremonies to kill it. For neither did you ground vpon the wordes of scripture, but onely on a circumstance obserued by the Fathers, that Paule went to Peter of reuerence to honour him: and I slew the reason (which you made thereof) with the sword of scriptures; I vsed the booke of Ceremonies, but as an Irish Lackey, to cut off a dead mans head. I would not haue vouchsafed as much as to name him, but to cast the doong of your solemnities in your faces: and to shewe the fondnesse of a Popish reason, by practise of a Papall mockery. Though I sée not, why you should preferre so the scriptures and Fathers before the booke of Ceremonies. For the booke of Ceremonies speaketh more good of the Pope in one leafe, then both the other doo throughout all their volumes. And

               How the Fathers all agrée with one consent of Peters supremacy: it shall be shewed hereafter. As for the circumstance which I obserued out of them touching the fact of Paule, y• 
                  when he went to see Peter, he went of reuerence to honour him: I doo not account so greatly thereof, as ofthe fact it selfe; nor vrge I the Fathers so much obseruing that, as the report of this made by the Scriptures. For they set it forth, with so liuely wordes, as if it were of purpose to paint out Peters primacie. 
                     Gal. 1.18. 
                  Then after thre yeares I went to Ierusalem (saith Paule) to see Peter and taried with him fifteene daies. Marke his words, I pray, and sée what weight they cary with them. He went to Ierusalem, so farre, so long a iourney; and he went notwithstanding his great affaires ecclesiastical; and he went to see Peter, not in the vulgar maner, but (as S.

Neither did he go onely to see him; but he abode with him also, to fill him selfe with a perfit viewe of his behauiour. And he abode with him no common time, but fifteen daies: fiftene daies, a great matter, and more then many would

thinke, who doo not search the depth of scriptures. In such estimation was Peter with Paule: and will you yet deny his primacy?

               I thought they had béene things both of one nature, and differing in name only. But I will speake of Peter. And that you may sée that the shoo which you made is too great for his foote: I will shew it by a plaine demonstration to the eye. The mother of our Sauiour, the blessed virgin Marie, is called, in the scripture, 
                     Luc. 1. ver. 28. 
                  blessed among women: that is (as I interpret it after the Hebrue phrase) the most blessed of women. What thinke you of her? Was there any woman in her time aboue her, in any thing of name, of excellencie and maiestie?
            
            
               Hart.
               Aboue her? God forbid. Neither in her time, nor before her, nor after her.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Yet shée, when 
                     ver. 35. 
                  the holy Ghost was come vpon her now, and the power of the highest had ouershadowed her, 
                  
                     ver. 39. 
                  went into the hill country with hast to a citie of Iuda, not only to sée, but also 
                     ver. 40. to salute her coosin Elisabet. And 
                     ver. 41. 
                  her salutation was such, that when Elisabet great with child did heare it: the babe sprang in her belly, and she was filled with the holie Ghost. Neither did shée only goe to salute her; but 
                     ver. 56. 
                  taried with her also: and that no common time, but about three moneths; three moneths, a great time, chiefly for a woman, which was conceaued with childe. If you tendered not the blessed virgins honor more then you doo Paules: your Rhetorike, that depresseth Paule beneath Peter, would much more debase

her beneath Elisabet. For shée was coosin to Elisabet according to the flesh: Paule was Peters brother according to the spirite, 
                     Matt. 12.42. a néerer kinne, & straiter bond of amitie and duetie. Shée went a harder iourney, into the hill countrie: Paule a pleasantor to Ierusalem; whither some other causes might allure him also. Shée was a woman, weaker of bodie, and might away with trauell worse: Paule a man, strong, exercised with toyles and troubles. Shée went thither in hast: Paule, after three yeeres. Paule went to see Peter: shée to salute Elisabet. Her salutation was so heauenly, that the babes bodie, & the mothers spirit felt it: nothing is written of Paules seeing Peter, but only that he saw him. She staied with her coosin about three moneths: Paul abode with Peter no more then fifteene daies. Yet Paule, as an Apostle, might be and stay any where: the virgin, as 
                     Luc. 1.27. 
                  a maide betrothed to a man, had greater cause to kéepe home, chiefly being with childe. Wherefore if Peter were aboue Paule in excellency and maiestie, because he did goe to Ierusalem to see him, and stayed with him fifteen daies: what might Elisabet be aboue the blessed virgin, which went into the hill countrie to salute her, and abode with her about three moneths?
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay. But there is more in the fiftéene dayes of Pauls abode with Peter, then in the thrée moneths of Maries with Elisabet.

               Hart.
               Marry there is a mysterie (as S. Ierome sheweth) in the number of dayes which Paule did spend with him.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               You commended the liuely wordes of the text: & nowe from them you flit to Ierome. They be mysteries, I sée, that must set a helping hand to your supremacy: the literall sense of scripture will do nothing for it. But what is the mysterie?

                  Ierome (in an epistle, which commonly is printed in the beginning of the Bible, because it intreateth of all the bookes of holy scriptures) falling into mention of Paule how hee staied with Peter fifteene dayes, doth giue this reason of it: hoc enim mysterio hebdomadis & ogdoadis futurus gentium praedicator instruendus erat; for by this mysterie of the number of seuen and eight, he who shuld become the preacher of the Gentiles, was to be instructed.

               And what did S. Ierome meane by this mysterie of the number of seuen and eight, which he diuideth those fifteene dayes into? How was Paule (I pray) to be instructed by it?
            
            
               Hart.
               Looke you to that. Those are his owne words: wherein you haue as much expressed, as I said: that it is a mysterie.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But it is like to be a mysterie still, if it be not expounded: and wée shall lose the kernell, vnlesse the nut be broken.

               Rainoldes.
               I say that father Maximus did doate whē he made it. For by this reason Paule should haue learned the gospell of Peter: which the Scripture denyeth, protesting, 
                     Gal. 1.12. that he neither receiued it of man, neither was taught it, but by the reuelation of Iesus Christ. And if you desire candlelight at noone daie to helpe the brightnes of the Sunne shining in his strēgth: you may know that the Fathers,

               You are wont to lay it vnto our charge, that we discouer the nakednes of the Fathers. In déede, you are they, who entreate them so.

For what a spéech is this, which you alleage of Ierom, that Paule had not had securitie of preaching the Gospell, vnlesse Peter had approued it. What? Was he called by 
                     Gal. 1. ver. 1. 
                  God to preach the Gospell, and durst he not do it, except men did like it? And when 
                     ver. 12. 
                  Christ had taught it him by reuelation was he not sure of it, but by conference with Peter? And had he preached it 
                     ver. 18. & Gal. 2. ver. 1. almost twentie yeares, and was he now afraid least hee had preached falsely.
            
            
               Hart.
               
                  S. Ierom saith not so: but that he had not had securitie of preaching it, vnlesse it had bene approued by the rest, with whom he did confer of it.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  S. Ierom saith not so: but that he had not had securitie. Then S. Ierom saith so, in that he saith not so: and you vnsay in one word, that which you say in an other. For what is it else not to haue securitie of preaching the Gospell: then to be afraid either of his doctrine, that it is not true; or of his fact, that it is not lawfull?
            
            
               Hart.
               Why doth 
                     Gal. 2.2. the scripture then report of S. Paule that he conferred with them, least he should runne, or had runne in vaine.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Because many Christians, whom Paule had preached the Gospell too, began to be seduced by false Apostles of the Iewes: 
                     Gal. 1.7. & 5.2. who taught them, that except they kept the law of Moses, they could not be saued. And to winne credit to their hereticall doctrine, that the hearers might receiue it the sooner for

the authoritie of the teachers: they said, it was the doctrine of Peter, and the rest, the chiefe of the Apostles, the pillars of the Church. As for Paule, who taught the contrarie thereof: they disgraced him, as one that was crept into the Apostleship after thē; and hauing learned the gospell of them, which he preached, yet dissented frō them in the preaching of it. Which spéeches of seducers, if they had beléeued, whom Paule either should or had alreadie preached the Gospell vnto: 2. Cor. 11.3. then should they haue fallen away with mindes corrupted from the simplicitie, that is in Christ, and Paule haue lost his labor, and runne in vaine, as hee speaketh, that is to say, without profit, without the 
                     Rom. 1.13. 
                  fruit of that hee ran for. As Christ complaineth in 
                     Esay 49.4. the Prophet, I haue labored in vaine, I haue spent my strength in vaine and for nothing: because he was not receiued of the Iewes, to whom he preched the word of life. Wherefore Paule, desirous, as a carefull husbandman, to reape where he had sowne: did seeke to roote out the wéedes of false Apostles, yt did or might hinder the growth of the corne. In which consideration, hauing shewed, first, touching his authoritie, 
                     Gal. 1. ver. 1. that he had it not of men, nor by man, but by God: next, touching his doctrine, 
                     ver. 12. that he learned it of Christ, not of the Apostles: touching his dissension from them, he sheweth last, 
                     Gal. 2.2. that he went and conferred with the chiefe of them, euen Iames, Peter, and Iohn, who were accounted to be pillars, that they might witnesse their consent, and make his preaching to be fruitfull, and stoppe the mouthes of false Apostles. All this S. Ierom saw, and taught, 
                     In epist. ad Gal. cap. 1. & 2. in his commentaries on Paule to the Galatians: where he aduised better of Paules intent, and drift, and sifted all the pointes and circumstances of the text. The wordes which you stand on, were vttered lesse aduisedly by him, in 
                     De Petro repre henso a Paulo. Epist. 11. inter epist. August.
                   an epistle written to S. Austin: against whom, to iustifie his opinion, (though false,) that Peters fault at Antioche was no fault in deede, nor Paule reproued him in earnest, he saith, for the credit of one aboue the other, Paule had not had securitie of preaching the Gospell, vnlesse that Peter had approued it. Wherefore I may iustly speake in his excuse (at the least, to soften the hardnes of his spéech) the same which 
                     Epist. 64. 
                  Basil said in excuse of Gregorie, that his wordes were vttered

                  not by way of doctrine, but of contention; rather to maintaine his quarell against Austin, then to deliuer his iudgemēt of ye matter; as writing

of affection more what he fansied, then of discretion what he thought. Whereof there appeareth as it were a print euen in his owne wordes. For he doth mention Peter by name, (of whom he did contend with Austin,) and none of the rest: whereas the Scripture nameth no more him then others; but 
                     Gal. 2. ver.

                     ver. 9. after (in particular) of Iames, Peter and Iohn, that they were counted to be pillars. Thus, neither did Paule conferre with Peter onely, but with Iames and Iohn, and therefore it proueth no suprem

They make you not to see in Paule to the Galatians his direct purpose of ouerthrowing that, which you would haue him build. They moue you to depraue the circumstāces of his words, as though he proued him selfe inferior to Peter in that by which he proueth him selfe not inferior. They stirre you to transforme his summission into subiection: and to abuse the spirite of his apostolike modestie to the raysing vp of the Papall pride and pompe of the supremacie. Paule went to see Peter with a desire of knowing him, which the Greeke word importeth: as they vse (saith

                   that terme is vsed. Paule went to Ierusalem 
                  
                     Act. 9.26 from the citie of Damascus: not much aboue a hundred miles. You say he went, so farre, so long a iourney: as though it had bene no lesse then hence to go to the court of Rome, which

                   Bishops do to the Pope, not of their owne accord (as Paule,) but enforced thereto by solemne oth; not twise in seuentéene yeares (as Paule,) but euery yeare once, by them selues, or by their messengers, vnlesse the Pope dispense with them. But of all the rest, that passeth, that you say hee went to Ierusalem, to sée Peter, notwithstanding his great affaires ecclesiasticall. Here was art, by the way, to shew, that Bishops may neglect their own charge to go to sée the Pope, vnder the color of Pauls example. And to hide this art, it was an other point of art: if it bée known, it is nought worth. For what were these great affaires ecclesiasticall, which Paule omitted to see Peter? Forsooth, 
                     Act. 9.24. at Damascus the Iewes laie in waite, and watched the gates of the citie day and night that they might kill him: in so much that he was faine to be conueied away by the wall in the night time, the disciples letting him downe in a basket; and so he scaped to Ierusalem. These are the affaires, the great affaires ecclesiasticall, the which notwithstanding, Paule went from Damascus to Ierusalem to see Peter. Wherein, hée had a reuerent regard to the supremacy of Peter, as you say: as 
                     Greg. Martin in his treatise of Christian peregrination.
                   a friend of yours saith, he went in pilgrimage to Peter. Whether of you applieth the place to better purpose, and fitter for the text: it may be a question. But in shew it séemeth to make more for pilgrimage, then for the supremacy.
            
            
               Hart.
               Sée, what wrong you doo to that learned man. Hée saith, that when Paule went to see Peter, he made a certaine pilgrimage: and you report him to haue said, that he went in pilgrimage.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  Hee made a certaine pilgrimage: I crye you mercy. I thought he would haue proued that kinde of pilgrimage which our Church reproueth: and so he meant to doo; at least, he pretended it. But, in prouing it, he dalieth (like a Sophister) with a certaine pilgrimage, such as our Church alloweth. You might as well say, that I came from Oxford in pilgrimage to you: in a certaine pilgrimage. And he was ouerséene, that amongst

examples of pilgrimage in scripture, he did not mention 
                     Gen. 47.9. 
                  Iacob: who saith that he spent his life time in pilgrimage; yea, and that his fathers spent in their pilgrimages longer time then he. But whatsoeuer shew the fact of Paule hath for a certaine pilgrimage, in that he went to see Peter: it hath no shew at all for Peters supremacy. Nay, the whole discourse of Paule in that point, dooth driue flat against it: as it hath appeared (in 
                     Chap. 3. Diuis. 1. part therof) already. Wherfore, you were abused by them who sent you thither. You should haue done better to haue conteined your selfe within the Actes of the Apostles. And if your two places, in the first, and the fiftéenth, had not force inough to proue that which you would: you might in stéed therof haue taken two other, out of the eight, & the eleuenth, which haue force enough to proue that which you should. For, in the one, 
                     Act. 8.14. 
                  the Apostles which were at Ierusalem, sent Peter and Iohn to the people of Samaria, to strengthen them in the faith through the gift of the holy Ghost. In the other, 
                     Act. 11.3. 
                  the Apostles and brethren that were in Iury called Peter to an accoūt (when he had preached to Cornelius,) why hee went in to men vncircumcised, and did eate with them.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Alacke, you imagine, that the Apostles had equall power with Peter, because they sent him abroad in commission, and asked him a count of that which he did. Poore reasons: God wote. For an inferiour may entreat his superiour to doo his busines for him. And specially a bodie politike or a corporation may choose their head and send him: as Citizens may send their Mayor to the Prince, or Parlament, though he be head of the Citie because he may be more fit to doo their businesse. And as they may send him, so may they aske a reason of that which hée hath done, and call him to account of it. Wéene you, that the Cardinals may not entreate the Pope to doo this or that, which shall be conuenient for the commoditie of the Church? Or, that the Pope will thinke his state to be abased, if they enquire of him why hée dooth this or that? Perhaps you wéene so, because you know neither the Pope, nor the Cardinals. But what say you then to your owne selues? Doo not your Seniours in Corpus Christi Colledge send abroad your President about your Colledge businesse? Dooth he not giue you an account of those things which hée hath done? Or, if he giue it not, may you not aske it of him? And is

he therefore not your head?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Yes, he is our head: but he is such a head, that your head of Rome had rather you should loose your head, then you should so behead his power. I tolde you so much In the first Diuision of this chapter. before in effect: and made it plaine vnto you by Duarens similitude of the President of a court of Parlament in France, named the head of the court. You might haue conceiued the same of our President: and thought his headship as vnfit for the proofe of your purpose, as you thought the other. For he is bound to statutes: by them we send him out, and aske account of that he dooth. No statutes binde your Pope: but his lust is his law; and what hée will, that is holy. We may depriue our President if he shoulde commit any heinous crime, as murther, or adultery. Your Pope, although he be as wilfull a murtherer, and as notorious an adulterer as Pope

Doo you thinke your selfe, I pray, in good sooth, that Peter (in the Actes of the Apostles) was as Pope, and the rest of the Apostles as the Colledge of Cardinals?

               It would be strange newes to heare that ye 
                  Cardinals shuld send ye 
                  Pope in Embassage, (& make him as it were Legate a latere,) chiefly, to pray for men conuerted to the fayth of Christ, and to preach vnto them. The Colledge of the Apostles sent Peter

                      8. ver. 15.17. & 25. to doo these things. You séeme to say, they did it by intreatie; be it: and, as a corporation may send their head about their busines, because hee is more fit to doo it. But might the Colledge of Cardinals send the Pope abroad by ye like intreatie? Unlesse perhaps you make this difference betwéene

them: that in other corporations the head sometimes is fitter; but the Pope is fitter for no busines of the Church, then any of his corporation. Howbeit, euen of that too, it followeth in part, that Peter was not throughly as Pope in the former point. As for the later, of calling him to account: although your good wéening of the Pope persuadeth you, that he would not thinke his state to be abased if the Cardinals should aske him why he dooth this or that: yet they who knew him better a great deale, then you, and loued him so well that they woulde not belie him, doo witnesse, not onely by word but by writing, that he will not bée dealt withall by his inferiours, as Peter was by the Apostles.

The Church is the Spouse of christ and ladie of the house: Peter a seruant and minister. Wherefore the Church may, not onely exact an account of her ministers, but also depose thē & reiect them altogither, if they be not fit.

Who say, they are aboue the Councell? Who may iudge all, and none may iudge them? This Preacher, a Preacher of your own, not ours, dooth call them wicked Bishops. The Lord of his mercy make his wordes a prophecy: that those wicked Bishops may be confounded of all and eche in seuerall, by the iust iudgement of God.

               You bring me wordes of Ferus, which were not his, perhaps, but thrust into his commentaries before they came vnto the print, by some malitious heretike. For 
                     Biblioth. sanctae lib. 6. annotat. 72. 
                  Sixtus Senensis saith, that there are witnesses of very good credit, who auouch that the commentaries of Ferus vpon Matthew were corrupted by heretikes, after his death, before they were printed.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  Sixtus saith in déede of his Commentaries vpon Matthew, that they were corrupted, chiefly in 
                  
                     Commentar. in Matt. lib. 3. 
                  that place, where Ferus speaketh of the keyes that Christ did promise Peter. For there is set downe, as a speciall note, that Christ saith to Peter, 
                  
                     Tibi dabo cla
                        
                           •
                        es regni coelorum: non dicit, regni terrarum.
                   
                  I will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen: hee saith not, the keyes of the kingdome of earth. These wordes pertaine nothing to an earthly power: which yet some endeuour by them to establish, affirming that Peter receiued fulnes of power not only in spirituall things, but also temporall. And after declaration, how this is plainely reproued by S. 
                  
                     De considerat. ad Eugen. lib. 1. 
                  Bernard, writing to Pope Eugenius: it is added farther. Peter receiued the keyes, that is to say, power: not an earthly power, that he might giue and take away dominions and kingdomes: neither such a power that it should be lawfull for him to doo what hee list, (as many men dreame,) but he receaued the power of binding and loosing, opening & shutting, remitting and retaining sinnes: neither this at his pleasure, but as a minister and seruant, doing the wil of his Lord. And these are the words, which sauour so strongly of an hereticall spirite, that Sixtus saith, it is auouched by credible witnesses, the cōmentaries of Ferus on Matthew wer corrupted, after his death, by heretikes, 
                  
                     Praesertim hoc loco: saith Sixtus Senensis
                     ▪
                   
                  chiefly in this place, before they wer printed. Wherin both ye 
                  witnesses, & Sixtus (in my iudgement) haue shewed thē selues wise. For it is better to beare men in hand that heretikes corrupted the commentaries of Ferus, chiefely in this place: then it should be thought that the strongest hold of all your religion [the Popes supreme power to giue and take away kingdomes] is shaken by a man so learned, so famous, so Catholike, as Ferus. But Sixtus saith not of his Commentaries on the Acts, that they were corrupted also by heretikes. Yet some heretikes hand may séeme to haue béene in them, chiefely in this place: where he doth reproue the arrogancie of the Popes, and nameth them

                  wicked Bishops. Wherefore it would do well, that the ouersight of Sixtus, herein, were mended by some other Sixtus: who might say as much of Ferus on the Actes, as Sixtus saith of him on Matthew. Perhaps you haue not witnesses, that wil auouch this, as some auouched that. The least matter of a thousand. For two or three such as Popish Chronicle writers. 
                  Surius, Pontacus, and Genebrardus, men that haue sold them selues to make lies in the defense of Popery, will be readie (on the credite of a Two knights of the poste. 
                  Lindan or Bolsecke,) not only to say it but to Chronicle it too. Here is al the difficultie, that 
                     Ferns in Acta Apost. Coloniae. 1567. apud haeredes Arnoldi Birckman cum priuileg. Caes. Maiest. In Matthaeum, Maguneiae, 1559. apud Franciscum Behem cum priuilegio Caesar. Maiest & Regis Gallorum.
                   these bookes are printed thus amongst your selues: who set them foorth first, and we receiue them at your hands. A great faulte, I know not whether of printers, or censours and allowers of bookes to the print: who suffer such scandalous places to bée printed. Yea

                   to be printed so still: specially when Sixtus Senensis hath said and credible witnesses haue auouched that heretikes did corrupt them. No, no, M. Hart, it is too stale a iest to say that heretikes haue corrupted the commentaries of Ferus. For the abomination of the Popes supremacie, oppressing both the magistracie of the common wealth, and ministerie of the Church, is grown to such outrage: that if we (whom you call heretikes) should hold our peace, the stones would cry against it.
            
            
               Hart.
               What néedes all this of Ferus? Or Sixtus? Or Canonistes? Or I know not who? You called me to the scriptures, whē I brought the Fathers: and now from the scriptures you bring me to writers of our owne age.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Not from the scriptures to them: but to the scriptures by them. As Christ, when the Phariseis sclaundered his workes, 
                     Mat. 12.27. alleaged the example of their own children therby to make them sée the truth. And as he said to them, therefore your children shall be your iudges: so I say to you, therefore your brethren shall be your iudges.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               I graunt that the Pope doth not in all respectes submit him selfe, as Peter, to giue account of his dooings, both to the Apostles, and to inferior Christians. But Ferus should haue considered, and so must you, that the times are not like. It were not conuenient for him to do so now.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               So I thought: the case is altered. You meane by [the times,] the mē, who liue in the times, I trow. In déede they

are not like. For Peter was then a preacher of the Gospell, as Pastors are now: and the Pope now is a Prince of the world, as Nero was then.
            
         
         
            The fifth Chapter. The Fathers 1 are no touch-stone for tryal of the truth in controuersies of religion, but the Scripture onely. 2 Their writings are corrupted: and counterfeits do beare their names. 3 The sayings, alleaged out of their right writinges, proue not the pretended supremacie of Peter.

                  What soeuer difference there is betwéen the Pope & Peter in state, and power of worldly gouernment: yet Peter had the same authoritie and primacie ouer the Apostles, which the Pope claimeth ouer all Bishops. And this (because you will not yéeld vnto the Scriptures) I will proue by the Fathers: whose testimonies of it are most cléere and euident.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Whether I, or you, refuse to yéeld vnto the scriptures: let the godly iudge. As for the Fathers: I like your dealing well, in part. For I wished, that first you would go through with the Scriptures: and then (when you had found nothing in them) come to the Fathers afterward. But I wish further, if I might obteine it, that you had the Scriptures in such price and honour, as the word of God: that no word of men should be matched with them to build your faith vpon. For God hath giuen his word to be 
                     Ps. 119.105. 
                  a lanterne to our feete, and a light to our path: that we may sée the way to heauen, and walke in it. And 2. Tim 3.15. the holy Ghost saith, that the Scriptures are able to make vs wise vnto saluation: wise, by instructing vs in the faith of Christ; vnto saluation, by leading vs to 
                     Ioh. 20.31. 
                  life through that faith. Wherfore sith we conferre about a point of wisedome perteining vnto faith and life: you should do very well to rest on the Scriptures as the onely touch-stone for tryall of the truth therin.
            
            
               Hart.
               Now at length I heare that, which I looked for. I thought, for all your duetifull words of the Fathers, that you

would come ouer to the Scriptures onely, before you made an end.

               They are worse afraid then hurt, for any thing that I know. But what of Vincentius?
               
            
            
               Hart.
               He saith 
                     Vincent. Lirin. cap. 35. 
                  it is so common a practise of heretikes to alleage the scripture, that they neuer bring almost ought of their own, but they seeke to shadow it with words of scripture too. And hauing shewed this by sundry examples, he addeth that 
                     cap. 37. 
                  therein they folow the practise of the Deuill, their maister. Who tooke our Sauiour Christ, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said vnto him, If thou be the sonne of God, cast thy selfe down: For it is written, that he will giue his Angels charge ouer thee, that they shall kepe thee in all thy waies: with their hands they shall lift thee vp, least perhaps thou dash thy foote against a stone. If thou, saith he, be the sonne of God, cast thy selfe down. Why? For it is written. We must with great heede obserue and remember the doctrine of this place: that when we see words of the Prophets or Apostles brought foorth by any men against the Catholike faith, we way be assured by this great example of the authoritie of the Gospel, that the Deuil doth speake by them. Thus saith that auncient Father, Vincē
                     tius Lirinensis. Whose words do manifestly disproue your opinion, that the truth of pointes in faith should be tryed by the scripture onely.

dealing with the wordes of Vincentius Lirinensis is guiltie of this vnciuilitie. For he, to instruct vs, how we may continue sound in the faith, against the guiles of heretikes and suttletie of Satan, who doth transforme him selfe into an Angell of light: 
                  
                     Vincent. Lirin. cap. 36. teacheth that our Sauiour hath to this entent both forewarned vs of the danger, and foreshewed vs a remedy. Forewarned vs of the daunger, in the precept that he gaue: Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheepes clothing, but inwardly are rauening wolues. For what, saith he, is sheepes clothing, but the sincere and soft words of the Scripture, which are alleaged by false prophets, as well as by the true? What are the rauening wolues, but the cruell meanings and senses of heretikes, which, vnder sheepes clothing, do rent the flocke of Christ? Foreshewed vs a remedy, in the lesson that he adioined: Ye shal know them by their fruites. That is to say, when they be gin not onely to alleadge those wordes but to expound them, and citing them as true prophets, do not interprete them as true prophets: then are the wolues seene by their teeth and rauening; then are their bloudy natures known for all their fleeces; 
                  
                     cap. 37. 
                  then are the faithfull teachers discerned from seducers, the true Apostles from the false, the Angell of light from the Angell of darknes, the ministers of righteousnes from the ministers of Satan. Which thinges, set downe and prosequuted more amply, and fully, he draweth in fine vnto this conclusion, (the summe of all his treatise:) 
                     cap. 38. & 41. that, although the scriptures alone be sufficient for all pointes of faith, yet is it not sufficient to haue a shew of the wordes, but we must also haue the substance of the sense, that is, the true and naturall meaning of the scriptures. Now, if this discourse of his be weighed whole, and not a parcell of it seuered from the rest: what can you proue thereby, more then I will graunt? Nay more then I haue graunted and proued alreadie, 
                     Chapt. 2. Diuision 2. when I shewed that the right sense of the scripture expounded by the scripture, is the sword of Gods spirit, wherewith all heresies must be vanquished. The Deuill (you say) alleaged the wordes of the scripture against Christ. He did so. Yet, he alleaged thē, not wholy & entirely, as Vincē
                     tius hath them: but, as 
                     Matthew 4.6. and Luke 4.10 Both omitting and leauing the words (In all thy waies) out of the text of scripture (Psalm. 91.11.) which the Deuill alleaged. 
                  the Euangelistes rehearse them, maimedly. Wherein, if Vincentius, obseruing the attempt that the Deuill alleaged the wordes of the scripture; had withall

obserued the suttletie of the tempter, how he alleaged them: hée might haue better noted the deceites of heretikes abusing scripture, then he did; and so haue better fensed the right-beléeuing Christians with power of scripture, then he hath. For he reporteth it so, as if the Deuill had alleaged that whole place of the scripture: He will giue his Angels charge ouer thee, that they shall keepe thee 
                  
                     In omnibus vijs tuis: which wordes are added by Vincentius, as if the Euangelists had not left them out. 
                  in all thy wayes: with their handes they shall lift thee vp, and so forth. Whereas the deuill, alleaging the rest, of charge giuen, to keepe him and vphold him, left out of the middle wordes of keeping him [in all his wayes:] because they made directly against that to which he did tempt Christ, as 
                     Chapt. 2. Diuision 3. I haue declared. Wherefore if Vincentius had thought, that the scripture is no sufficient stay for vs against heretikes, because it is alleaged as well by false teachers, as it is by true, by the Deuill as by Christ: he must haue rather craued pardon, for not espying the policie of Satan; then liking, for impairing the credit of the word of God. But although he saw not all in particular: neuerthelesse in generall hee ioyneth with the truth. For 
                     Vincent. Lirin. cap. 37. hee saith that heretikes followe the Deuill, 
                  
                     Quotiescunque diuinae legi
                           •
                         sententias proferunt quibus malé interpretatis errores suos astruere conentur.
                   
                  as oft as they bring foorth sentences of scripture, by which beeing expounded amisse, they goe about to maintaine theyr errours. So that, the scripture, which heretikes bring foorth against the Catholike faith, is the scripture taken in a wrong sense, and misse-expounded, by his iudgement. But I meane the scripture expounded aright, when I say that pointes of faith should be tried by the scripture onely. The wordes of Vincentius therefore, which you cited, doo rather proue that which I defend, then disproue it. Neither make they more against vs then you: vnles you begge all that which is in controuersie, that Popery is the Catholike faith. For then you may conclude that wee bring the scripture against the Catholike faith, when we bring it against Popery. An easie way to conquest, if begging can procure you that. But I minde not to giue it: & right to it you haue not. You must winne it, if you will weare it.
            
            
               Hart.
               Whither that the faith of the Church of Rome, which you call Popery, be the Catholike faith or no: because it is the later part of our conference, concerning one faith; I will not confound it with this of one head. But what doo you meane to say that the wordes of Vincentius, which I cited, disproue not

your assertion, nor make against you more then vs? when hée saith, that heretikes doo alleage the scripture, as also did the Deuill: and you alleage it too, and thinke it a sufficient fense of your opinions.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               So doo you alleage it too: doo you not? And what is there against vs, in those wordes, more then against you? would you not laugh at me, if I should reason thus: Heretikes alleage scripture; so doo the Papists too: therefore they are heretikes?

                   such other Motiues, as your Bristow calleth them. Yea, they haue greater aduantage for their errours against the catholike faith, by these, then by scripture. For these may be truely alleaged against it, as they haue bene often: the scripture can neuer, but falsely, and wrongfully. As for that the Deuill alleaged the scripture onely, against Christ: you thinke his example discrediteth the triall of truth in points of faith by the scripture onely. And so it may séeme to a weake eye. But to such as marke it with a sharper sight, it dooth confirme it rather. For

Tim. 4.2. and so foorth in the rest of the Scriptures. no meanes vnattempted whereby he may intangle the soules of mankinde, and wrappe them in the snares of death. Wherfore, as in his instruments he vseth other Motiues to preuaile with others: so him selfe of likelihood would haue vsed them specially to Christ, and not the scripture onely, had he not knowne, that onely scripture (if any thing) would preuaile with him. Stapleton, intending to perswade vs, that Peter, and (by reason of Peter) the Pope is supreme head of the Church: 
                     Princip. doctrin. lib. 6. in praefat.
                   saith that he will proue it 
                  
                     Sola ea, quae ex scripturis sacris peti potest demonstratione.
                   
                  by onely demonstration out of the scriptures, in effect, and that 
                     Ex solis scripturis.
                   
                  by onely scriptures it may bee proued fully enough and abundantly. Is not this a token, that we, whom he séeketh to winne by his perswasions, will not be woon thereto, but onely by the scriptures? So the Deuils practise in alleaging scripture onely to Christ, is a great presumption, that Christ accounted nothing a ground of faith and duetie, but onely the scripture. Whereof a surer argument is the whole behauiour of Christ against the Deuill: whom 
                     Matt. 4. ver. 4. & 7. & 10. in euery one of his three tentations he put to flight still with scripture, It is written. And although the Deuil (to driue him from that hold) alleaged scripture also: yet Christ replied not with 
                     Matt. 22.9. 
                  Fathers or Doctors, or Rabbines of the Synagogue, but with the word of his heauē
                     ly Father; and, against ye maimed & wrested wordes of scripture, he set the scripture alleaged rightly. Wherefore let As Bristow dooth, in his Motiues to the Catholike faith. Motiu. 48. your Captaines instruct their souldiours as they list, to get vs into the plaine fieldes of their Motiues, out of our weake and false castle of onely scripture, as

take the golde of Vincentius, you must grant, that scripture alone is sufficient to trie the truth from errour, and to mainteine the Catholike faith against heresie.
            
            
               Hart.
               You doo not deale well in misreporting so the words of Vincentius. For 
                     Vincent. Lirin. cap. 1. he setteth downe two meanes, by the which we must fense our faith against the guiles of heretikes, & eschue their snares: 
                     Primò, diuinae legis autoritate.
                   
                  first, by the authoritie (saith he) of the scripture; 
                  
                     Deinde, ecclesi ae catholicae traditione.
                   
                  then, by the tradition of the catholike Church. You leaue out altogither that which he saith of tradition
                  ▪ and handle him in such sort as though he had spoken for the scripture onely.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               It is not your purpose, (I hope) to beguile mée by the colour of his wordes. It may be, that your selfe are beguiled in them. For 
                     Vincent. Lirin. cap. 2. he, by [the traditiō of the catholike church] meant the true and right exposition of the scripture, made by faithfull pastors and teachers of the church: as his owne words immediately shew. And this I made mention of, in that I said, that 
                     Perfectus scripturarum canon.
                   
                  scripture is sufficient alone against heretikes

                  if it be taken in the right sense; the catholike sense hee calleth it. You séeme to imagine, that he meant by the worde, [tradition,] vnwritten verities, as they haue bin termed, or as you terme them now, 
                     Concil. Trident. Sess. 4. 
                  traditions: which the Trent-Councell dooth account as much of, as of scriptures, and coupleth them togither to make a sufficient & perfit rule of truth: as though that onely scriptures were insufficient for it. Which errour was so far from the minde of Vincentius, that 
                     Vincent. Lirin. cap. 2. & 41. he saith expresly, that he dooth not adde the traditiō of the Church, to the authoritie of the scriptures, as though that 
                  
                     Scripturarum canon

your Vincentius speaketh touching the tradition, and traditions, of the Church: do ioine hands with that which I did deliuer of the truth (in pointes of faith) to be tried by the scripture only.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               You may not cary so the wordes of Vincentius away in a cloude. For, though he may séeme to haue meant in generall by [the tradition of the Church] the expounding of scriptures according to the rule of their right and Catholike sense, which the Pastors of the Church deliuer: yet comming to particulars he frameth that rule, not out of the scriptures, but out of the opinions which the Church holdeth in matters of religion. For, 
                     Vincent. Lirin▪ cap. 38. he asketh him selfe, when heretikes pretend scriptures, what shall the Catholikes doo? How shall they discerne the truth from falshood in the scriptures? Whereto he maketh answere, that they must take the scriptures in the sense of the Church: and therein they must folow, vniuersalitie, antiquitie, consent. By the which 
                     cap. 3▪ 
                     and 4. thréefold meanes to trie the truth, he instructeth vs that we must hold that, which the church of our time doth hold through all the world vniuersally. If a part of Christendome diuide and cut it selfe from the faith of the whole: then are we bound to folow the whole, and not the part. If the whole in our time be stained with any error: then must we haue respect to the former time, and cleaue to antiquitie. If all in antiquity agreed not about it: then looke too consent; as, what a generalll Councell did decree therof; or, if no such decree be, what all the Fathers thought, or if not all, what the most, euen they who continued in the faith and felowship of the Catholike Church. And whatsoeuer we find that not one, or two, but all with one consent haue held, written, taught, plainely, commonly, continually: let vs be assured that we must hold also that without all doubt. Thus Vincentius sheweth how he would haue the truth to be tried by the church: if ye church be soūd, by the vniuersalitie of our own time: if that be corrupt, by the antiquitie of the former time; if that be at variance, by the consent of all, or most of the Fathers. Wherfore if you will stand vnto his iudgement, to which you giue countenance as though you liked it: you must not call the tryall of truth in religion to the scriptures onely, but to the consent of the Fathers rather.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I liked his iudgement in the generall point,

touching the sufficiencie and perfitnes of scriptures: which (I know) you like not, though you make greater semblaunce of liking him, then I. If in the particulars I mislike somewhat, let the blame be laid vpon the blame-worthy: not me, who stand to that which he hath spoken well; but him, who falleth from it. For, laying his foundation as it were, on a rocke: he buildeth vp his house beside it, on the sand. That scripture is sufficient, alone, against heretikes, so that it be taken in the right sense, expounded by the rules of the Catholike faith: this hath hée well auouched, as on the rocke of Gods word. But, that the rules of faith, and sense of the scripture must be tried and iudged by the consent, antiquitie, and vniuersalitie of the Church: this hath he added not so well, as on the sand of mens opinions. The difference of the pointes may be perceiued by S. Austin: who ioining in the former of them with Vincentius, doth leaue him in the later. For In his booke intitled De doctrina Christiana: as it is 
                        ••
                     ewed before, Chapt. 2. Diuis. 2. 
                  Austin, as he setteth the ground of religion in the right sense and Catholike meaning of the scripture: so teacheth he that this must be knowne and tried by the scripture it selfe, ye infallible rule of truth; not by the fickle minds of mē. And, to haue taught hereof as Austin doth, it had agreed best with the foundation of Vincentius: which maketh 
                     Scripturarum canon solus sibi sufficit ad vniuersa. Vincent. cap. 41. 
                  the rule of scriptures, alone, sufficient for all thinges. But because the weaker and ruder sort of Christians, haue not skill to know the right exposition of scripture from the wrong: therefore he, tempering him selfe to their infirmitie, doth giue them outward sensible markes to know it by. Wherein he dealeth with them, as if a Philosopher, hauing saide that a man is areasonable creature, should, because his scholers cannot discerne of reason (whereof the shew is such in many brute beastes, that 
                     Lactant. de ira Dei cap. 7. Plutarch. in opusc. quod brat. anim. ration. vtantur.
                   some haue thought them reasonable) describe him more plainely by outward markes, and accidents, as namely, that he hath two feete, and no feathers. They report, that

For which definitiō when he was commended, Diogenes tooke a Capon: and hauing pluckt his feathers off, did bring him in to the schoole of Plato, saying, This is Platoes man. The holy word of God is the same in the Church, that reason is in a man. Whereupon we giue it for an essential marke (as I may terme it) of the Church, by which the Church is surely known and discerned. But the shew

of Gods word is such in many heretikes, (as of reason in brute beastes,) that some, who haue no skill to discerne that marke, doo thinke it impossible to know the Church by it.

                   Your felowes hereupon describe the Church by outward and accidentall markes: as namely, by antiquity, succession, consent. These are very plausible, and many do commend them highly. But he that hath halfe an eie of a Philosopher, I meane a wise Christian: néede not playe Diogenes in plucking feathers off, to shew that these markes may agrée to a capon. Now, as they deale with the markes of the Church: so doo you, M. Hart, with the markes of the truth. Not Vincentius, but you, who couer your errors with the name of Vincentius: and take thinges, as necessary, and sure proofes of truth, which he did note, as probable, and likelye tokens of it onely. For he deliuered them, not as neuer failing, but as holding often: and such, as albeit they doo hit sometimes, yet do they misse sometimes also. Whereof him selfe is witnesse, in that he disproueth them: the first, vniuersality, by the example of the

               In déede he preferreth this marke before the rest, as hauing held when they fayled.

                  neither all heresies must be assaulted in this sort, nor alwaies, but only such as are new and greene: to weete, when first they spring vp, before they haue falsisied the rules of auncient faith, the very straitenes of time not suffering them to do it, and before (the poyson spreading abroad farther,) they endeuour to corrupt the writings of the Fathers. But

                  heresies that are spread abroad, and waxed old, must not be set vpon in this sort; because they, by long continuance of time, haue had long occasion to steale away the truth. And therefore whatsoeuer profanities there be, either of schismes, or heresies, that are waxed auncient:

Lo, when heresies are growne to be in yeares auncient, and ample in places; when they haue got antiquitie, and vniuersality: then must we fight against them, not by consent of Fathers, but by the authoritie of the scriptures only. This is the sentence of Vincentius Lirinensis, in that passing fine booke against the profane innouations of all heresies. Is it not a golden sentēce?

But there is no colour why therefore

you should refuse to deale with vs by the consent of Fathers. For, neither are the doctrines which we professe, heresies, much lesse olde and ample heresies, such as he speaketh of: nor haue wée endeuoured to corrupt the writings of the Fathers, nay, wée haue kept them, and endeuour daily to set them foorth most perfitly. But your heresies in déede, although they sprang of late, and may be counted new and greene; yet haue they endeuoured to corrupt the Fathers since, and haue done it.

Austin, declareth sundry bookes to be S. Austins owne, which Erasmus had noted as falsly fathered on him.

Of which it is shewed by Vincentius himselfe, that heresies may iustly claime the two former, vniuersalitie and antiquitie: and make a faire chalenge to the third, consent, in processe of time; so cunningly can they file the Fathers to their purposes. But you may not be touched with any such suspiciō. Why? Because the doctrines which you professe, are not olde and ample heresies, you say, no not heresies; ours are so, not yours.

The Schoolemen and Canonists, whose handes were chiefe in this iniquitie, did beare the whole sway for many yeares togither in Uniuersities and Churches. The Doctors & Fathers were pretended much, but more pretended, then regarded: and their bookes corrupted, what through ignorance of scriueners, who copied them out before the vse of printing, what through impudence of forgers, who coined counterfeites in their names. Now, when they lay thus distressed and diseased in the dust of Libraries: Erasmus, a man of excellent iudgement, and no lesse industrious, then learned, and wittie, did enterprise first to cure them, and brought them foorth into the light. In the workes of S. Ierome, which were most of all depraued aboue others, chiefly, the former tomes: he did what he could, both to clense them from blemishes, and to lighten them with his notes.

                   Hee professed, that his coniectures in restoring of places had not satisfied himselfe alwaies. He promised, that if any man should restore them better: hee would both embrace his trauaile very gladly, and reioyce at the publike profit. What sparkle of thankfulnes, but I let go thankfulnes, what sparkle of ingenuitie was there, and good nature, in Marian Victorius:

                   who requiteth such a worke so carefully attempted, so painfully performed, so modestly excused, with the tauntes and contumelies of erring, of lying, of craftines of ignorance, of heresie, of impietie?

Wherevpon, he craueth of such as he hath sought to benefite by his labour, thankes, for that he found; pardon, for that hee missed. If Victorius haue profited no better in the schoole of Christ, let him goe to Aristotle: and learne, first, to thinke more humbly of him selfe; afterward, to deale more modestly with others. And you, who like of him, because hee findeth fault with the dooings of Erasmus; as a shoomaker did with the picture of Apelles, for missing in a shoo-latchet: may know, that

Though the speciall point for which we blame Erasmus, is not this so much of errours in S. Ierome. His censures on S. Austin are misliked most: in that he reiecteth sundry bookes as counterfeit, which Torrensis proueth to bee S. Austins owne. Whereof the importance and danger is the greater, because some will haue nothing taken for S. Austins, but what Erasmus hath allowed.

                  certaine things are omitted: certaine, as not many; and errours they name them not; neyther tell they what. Now, if the notes of Viues on S. Austin haue found such disfauour: the censures of Erasmus, on him, may better beare it. And, to say the truth, they haue deserued it at your handes. For in those censures hath Erasmus shewed that many bookes doo falsely beare S. Austins name, by which, as by the warrant of S. Austins iudgement, sundry of your Schoolemens and Canonists dreames haue bene aduanced and aided. But he reiecteth some as counterfeit, you say, which Torrensis proueth to be S. Austins owne. And what maruell is it, if amongst hundreds he were deceiued in one or two? And hauing had triall of many false titles, he thought somefalse which were not? A fish, that hath béene touched once with the hooke, is saide to feare the hooke vnder euery meate. They, who by experience haue felt that some are coosiners, which beare the face of honest men, must bée borne with, if they suspect a man sometimes whom they néede not: chiefly, sith it proueth a greater point of wisedome to mistrust an honest man, then to trust a knaue. For, to trust a knaue, hath vndone many, and brought them past recouery. To mistrust an honest man, though it be a fault, yet is it lesse daungerous, and may be sooner mended. But what shall we thinke of your Torrensis policie? Who, vnder this pretense that Erasmus iudged some bookes not to be S. Austins, which are:

The Iesuit, as a yoonker, who could gaine by them, if he might put them all away, doth mingle them one with an other, and prayeth men to take them: protesting, that if they be not all English angels, yet they be Flemish; at least, they are stampt with the image of an angell. And although some curious and precise men are loth to take them in part of lawfull payment: yet there be good felowes that will permit and iudge them to be English angels, and will

Specially for that hee sheweth (in his censures) the reasons that moued him to thinke, as he doth, of the bookes which he refuseth: so that the church may thereby iudge of his iudgement. If you rather fansie the Iesuit Torrensis: vse your own discretion. But I would aduise others to beware howe they trust you, who doo so lightly trust him.

                  the sermons intitled to the Eremite Friers; giuing a note of infamie as to most of these, so to them withall; though him self deny not, but they were made by S. Austin. This is more, then distrusting a good angell for the badde. This is wilful refusing of an angell, as bad, the which he knoweth to be good.

               If Erasmus did this, not of error, but of malice, for hatred which he bare to monkes, as Torrensis suspecteth that he did: it were a great crime, and worthy to be published in print vnto the world. But if hee did it not of hatred, & malice, if he did it not at all, if he did the contrarie, if he reproued the partie by whom it was done, and him selfe redressed it: how will Torrensis make amends to Erasmus, whom he hath defamed with so lewd a slaunder? The sermons, entitled to the Eremit Friers, were impudently forged vnder S. Austins name, by some who was him selfe of that order belike, and gladly would haue gotten credit to his order by the title of such a patrone. Erasmus hath marked the most of these sermons with a note of infamie. Wherein, if he committed any offense, it was, that he markt no more of them so, not that he markt the most. For,

And if Erasmus caused them so to be printed, as he did of likelihood: it is no mortall sinne to think that he did it, not of error, but of malice & hatred against monks. For it is well knowne, that he could not abide them: and sundry of his censures are stained with that affection.

               The likely-hood is rather that Erasmus would not commit that himselfe, which he had condemned before in an other. At least, if he were so greatly ouershot, Torrensis should do well to quote vs the editiō, and take him vp more sharply, not only for malice but for folly too. But perhaps Torrensis hath done as (men say) Will Summer was wont: to let fly at Rowland, whē

Which séemeth to haue béene the printers scape rather then the ouerseers: sith that they agreeing in argument and style had the same iudgement both, as it is likely.

But the liking of them professed by Torrēsis hath stained with a witnes his Austins confession. For, to bring men in loue and admiration of their beggerly ceremonies,

                   who censureth him that forged it more sharply then Erasmus did. For he doth not onely call him a coosiner, but a sottish and shamelesse coosiner. And whereas Erasmus did yet notwithstanding 
                     Anno Domini 1527. & 1539. set it foorth amongst the rest of Ambroses workes: it séemed so lothsome and beastly to Costerius, that he hath cleane left it out. So that, in the later editions of Ambrose, 
                  
                     Anno Domini 1555. & 1567, it is not extant now. Only this place of it, touching the coole and girdle of the Austin-monkes, (or Austin-friers, as they are called,) is laid vp in Torrensis: a storehouse fit for such antiquities.
            
            
               Hart.
               If the Church allow the censures of those learned men:

               I know no learned man of your church that disalloweth them.
            
            
               Hart.
               Then is it to be thought, that when Torrensis quoted that sermon of S. Ambrose: he meant, (as he had saide 
                     Praefat. confess. Augustin. ad Lectorem.
                   afore of S. Austin) that either it is his; or some others like him.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               This neither doth hée say, nor his scholers gather, nor the truth agree too. For neither was it written by any like S. Ambrose, if a rash and sottish coosiner did forge it, which your supposall granteth: and he, with As namely, the defendet of the Censure against M. Charke. page 38. other after him, alleage it as written by S. Ambrose him selfe; whose it is manifest they would haue it supposed, for the cooles sake. So fauourable are you in bearing with your selues, to take that, as certainly written by the Fathers, which certainly is none of theirs. So sharpe against vs, if wee suspect any thing not to be theirs, which is: yea, though we suspect it not, but be falsly thought to haue suspected it through other mens default. And thus haue I cast out the beame out of our eie. Now, let vs sée the moate in yours. Your practises in corrupting the writings of the Fathers, are of two sortes: the one, before the art of printing was found; and the other, sithence. Examples of them both I will giue in our present question, touching the supremacy. The former sort therefore is rife in the chiefest Doctor of your Church, I meane,

               But why should you thinke either him to be the counterfeiter, or the sayings to be counterfeit, when, (as 
                     Alanus Copus Dialog. 1. ca. 13. 
                  Cope sheweth) they are alleaged not only by him, but by other too. Namely, by that worthie and most learned Cardinall

                  Iohn of Turrecremata, who was at the Councell of Basill; & before him by

                  Austin of Ancona: yea by Graecians themselues, who were at the councell of Florence, Andreas Bishop of Colossae, and Gennadius Scholarius the Patriarke of Constantinople. Of whom when the former said (in 
                  
                     Vid. session. 5.7. & 8. 
                  the Councell) that Cyrill in his treasures had very much extolled the authority of the Pope, none of all gainesaid him. The later, (in a treatise that hee wrote for the Latins against the Graecians, touching fiue pointes whereof one is the Popes supremacy) citeth the same testimonies,

although perhaps not all, which S. Thomas of Aquine doth out of Cyrill. Yet you amongst so many choose him whom you may carpe at: and thinke that wordes alleaged by them all, are counterfeites.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Counterfeites are counterfeites, though they go thorough twenty hands. Al these, whom you name out of Harpsfieldes Cope, did liue long after Thomas: and séeme to haue alleaged S. Cyrill on his credit, as Cope himselfe doth also. Wherefore I could not think that they had béene the coiners of yt which was before they were. But Thomas is the first, with whom I finde the words: and therefore greatest reason to laie the fault on him, vnlesse he shew from whom he had them. At least, séeing I know the words are not Cyrils, whose Thomas saith they be: I did him no iniurie (I trust) when I said, that either he receiued them at some coyners handes, or coyned them him selfe.
            
            
               Hart.
               Although the wordes are not to be found now in those partes of Cyrils treasure, which are extant: yet that is not sufficient to proue, that either Thomas or some other forged them. For 
                     Locor. Theologicor. lib. 6. cap. 5. 
                  Melchior Canus affirmeth that heretikes haue maimed that booke, and haue razed out all those things which therin pertained to the Popes authoritie. Which same thing to be done by them in the Commentaries of Theophylact vpon Iohn: the Catholikes haue found, and shewed.

               Mée thinkes, you and Canus deale against vs, as

You accuse vs, that we deny the Pope his right of the supremacy. The recordes, by which you proue it his right, are the wordes of Cyrill. Cyrils wordes are called for, that they may be séene. You say, they are not extant: you are robbed of them, by, I know not what heretikes. Whereon to put a greater likelihood, you say further, that heretikes haue done an other robbery in Theophylact, as they are charged by Catholikes. And this doo you say: but you say it onely: you bring no proofe, you name no witnesse, you shew no token of it. If such accusations may make a man guiltie: who shall be innocent?

               Hart.
               Admitte, that the words were not razed perhaps out of any booke of Cyrill, which we haue. Yet might they be in some of them, which are 
                     Alan. Copus, dialog. 1. cap. 13. lost, or 
                     Melchior Canus lib. 6. cap. 5. not set forth in Latin. For, we haue no more then fouretéene bookes of his treasure: whereas the two and thirtieth is cited by the Fathers in the 
                     Synodo 6. actione 10. sixth general Councell. And this is enough to remoue suspicion of forgery from Thomas, and other, who alleage them.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Nay, although the two and thirtieth be mentioned by the Fathers there: yet meant they no more of Cyrill, then we haue. For that, which in our Latin edition is the twelfth, is the two and thirtieth, in the Grecians count.
            
            
               Hart.
               This is an answere which I neuer heard. It hath no likelyhood of truth.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Peruse you the place, which toucheth that of Cyrill: and the wordes them selues will proue it more then likely.
            
            
               Hart.
               The Councel hath it thus. Hoc & sanctus Cyrillus in trigesimo secundo libro Thesaurorum docet, epistolam ad profanos explanans: nec enim vnam naturalem operationem dabimus esse Dei & creaturae; vt neque id quod creatum est ad diuinam deducamus essentiam, neque id quod est diuinae naturae praecipuum, ad locum qui creatis conuenit deponamus.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               This sentence, alleaged out of the two and thirtieth of Cyril in Gréeke, is 
                     In Cyrilli Thesauro lib. 12. cap. 1. in the twelfth booke of our Latin Cyrill. Sauing that, he being translated by 
                     Georgius Trapezuntius.
                   an other hath it in other wordes. But there is the sentence: the very same sentence which the Councell pointeth too.
            
            
               Hart.
               It might be there, first, and yet againe afterward in the two and thirtieth: as manye vse one sentence often.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But the circumstance of the place doth rather import it to be the very same. For, the Councell saith, that Cyrill hath these wordes, explanans epistolans ad profanos, where he expoundeth the epistle to profane men. And what meant they, by this epistle ad profanos, to profane men?
            
            
               Hart.
               How can I tell what they meant, when that booke of Cyrill (whereof they speake) is lost?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               It should be, the epistle ad Romanos, to the Romaines: [The Roman
                        •
                     
                   
                  Romanos] made [profane men. 
                  profanos] by the printers error:

vnlesse he did it of purpose, to shew, what now the Romanes be: or some corrector chaunged it, least wee by this circumstance should find the place of Cyrill. For, this [where he expoundeth the epistle to the Romanes] is a great argument, that the Councell meant the place in the twelfth booke: where Cyril doth handle such pointes of that epistle as concerned the matter that he had in hand. Which that he should doo againe, in the same worke, with the same sentence, touching the same matter: they who know Cyrill, will not thinke it likely. The lesse, because it is an vsuall thing with the Grecians, to diuide bookes otherwise then the Latins doo. As, in the Gréeke testament, the gospell of S. Marke hath more then fortie chapters, which hath not twentie in the Latin: and yet notwithstanding the Latin hath the whole, as well as the Gréeke. Which is the more likely to haue béene the difference betwéene the Gréeke Cyrill, alleaged by the Councell, and our Latin Cyrill translated out of Gréeke, because that our Latin hath also other sentences in the tenth booke, which are alleaged 
                     Action. 10. by the Councell out of the foure and twentéeth: and, in their diuision, As (in the same place) Cyrillus de Thesauris, capitulo vigesimo quarto, is aleaged: for which it is after, libro vigesimo quarto.
                   
                  a chapter and a booke did go for all one, wheras the bookes in Latin are sub-diuided into chapters. The mentioning therefore of more bookes of Cyrils treasure, then we haue, remoueth not suspicion of forgery from the sayings, which Thomas citeth thence for the Popes supremacie. Chiefely, sith Trapezuntius who translated that worke of Cyrill into Latin, was a man affectionate greatly to the Pope. That, if he had left out somewhat of yt Gréeke, as he hath perhaps, (vnlesse he vsed Cyril better then 
                     De praeparatione euangelica

                      which in Greeke hath much more, then it hath in latin trāslated by Trapezuntius.
                   
                  Eusebius:) yet is it not credible that he would haue left out so many places, so notable proofes of a thing so weighty, so néerely touching him whom he so déerely loued. In déede they are too notable, and perfit for the purpose: and such, as, your

But the forging of Cyrill might be better borne

with he was but one man. That is no way tolerable, that the like dealing is vsed with sixe hundred Bishops, and more, euen with the generall Councel of Chalcedon. Of whom

And againe after: Let all thinges be kept which are defined by him, as defined by the Vicar of the Apostolike see. And, to proue

                  that the Pope hath vniuersal soueraintie ouer the whole church of Christ: It is read, saith Thomas, in the Councel of Chalcedō, that the whole Councell did cry to Pope Leo, God graunt long life to Leo, the most holy, Apostolike, & 
                  It is in Thomas, Icumeraycos, id est vniuersalis: but he meaneth

                  vniuersall Patriarke of the whole world. Nowe in the generall Councell of Calcedon there is not one of these thinges: no more, then the other were in Cyrils treasure. Wherefore it must needes be, that either Thomas coined them, or had them from some coiner. Belike he, who did it, was maister of the Popes mint: and who that should be, but Thomas, I know not.

               Neither Thomas, nor any els. For these thinges were writen in the Councell of Calcedon: but heretikes haue razed them out of our copies, as

great prerogatiues as Rome, the church of Rome crying against it. And hereof

Nay the verye canons them selues of that Councell, which are agreed vpon in both the Greeke & Latin copies, do cut off al shew from such false and friuolous defenses of Thomas. For it cannot be thought, that so great a Councell, of so wise men, ordeined things repugnant one vnto an other: and 
                     Concil. Chalced. can. 1.9.17. & 19. they haue ordeined repugnant vnto that which Thomas citeth of the Pope, as shall appeare

But Canus hath greatly both abused you and ouershot himselfe: who, to proue that now the copies haue not those thinges which they had in Thomas time, bringeth Gregory for witnesse, who liued Aboue sixt hundred yeares. long before Thomas; and chargeth heretikes with that, wherewith Gregory chargeth 
                     Ab ecclesia Constantinop.
                   
                  Catholikes; and saith, that they haue razed out, where Gregory saith they haue

                  falsified, which they might do by adding too; and speaketh it of sundry places, which Gregory speaketh but of

                  one, and that one (by the iudgement of your owne fréendes) an other one then those of Thomas. Now much more ingenuously should Canus haue done, and you (who follow him in euill,) to confesse a fault where a fault is, then to commit many for the couering of one; and for cléering Thomas, to corrupt Gregory; and to sclaunder vs with vniust reproches, that you maye saue your selues from a iust reproofe.

               I did not peruse the place my selfe in Gregory: but tooke it, as I found it alleaged by learned men. For

Which wordes if you could hansomly take away out of him in some new print, (and why not take away so few, as well as adde so many?) then would this be a passing fine place for you, to perswade men, that the vnity of the church doth presuppose your one chaire, to which all must be subiect, who wil be of the church: and that they (by consequēt) are no right Christians, who stand against the Popes supremacie.

                   singular care was taken by Cardinall Borromaeus; a copie was gotten of great antiquitie from Verona; the exquisite diligence of learned men was vsed in it. Wherefore I am perswaded, that whatsoeuer they did adde vnto Ciprian they did not adde it rashly, or of their owne head, but with good aduise vpon the warrant of writen copies. Which although they haue not declared in particular, yet may we gather it by

               And it is as truely said by the Orators: Nothing is done so euil, but with faire colours a man may defēd it. The Pope sent for Manutius to print the Fathers corrected; he appointed foure Cardinals to see the worke done; Cardinall Borromaus had singular care of Cyprian; copies very auncient,

men very learned, exquisite diligence vsed in it. This is it, which maketh me the more suspect it: the diligence was too exquisit.

                  Pamelius hath obserued: & that euen in this treatise touching the vnity of the church. But whether I haue reasō to say, that the wordes (whereof we speake) in Cyprian, might come into the text out of the margent-note: I leaue it to be iudged by reasonable men vpon the viewe of the circumstances. The writen copie (cited by 
                     Annot. in. Cyprian. de vnitat. eccles.
                   
                  Pamelius him selfe) which Cardinall Hosius occupied, conuinceth it most plainly, for the chiefest of thē. For there, after the speech of Christ vnto Peter, alleaged out of Matthew, these wordes are interlaced, Hic Petro primatus datur, Here the primacie is giuen vnto Peter. Which to haue béene noted by some in the margent, it is so manifest, that neither the Romane-print nor the Anwerp could bring them into Cyprians text, but either by chaunging or leauing out the word [Here:] 
                  
                     Roman. Et primatus Petro datur.
                   the one hath chaunged it into the word▪ 
                  [And,] 
                  
                     Antuerp. Primatus Petro datur.
                   the other hath left it out. That the rest of [one chaire] crept in by like stealth: it is very probable, though harder to conuince. But the last of [sticking vnto Peters chaire] added by Pamelius, doo séeme to haue lept into the text sodainely, before the margent sawe them. For, they are written not onely in the copie of the Cambron-abbey, but in Gratian too. And thereupon Pamelius saith that he was bold to put them into Cyprians text. Now shall the Fathers be well amended shortly, if you amend them out of Gratian: a man, who in fauour of the Popes State hath forged and falsified the writings of the Fathers most lewdly and shamefully.

               The clause, which Pamelius added to Cyprian, he added on the warrant not of Gratians credit, but of the Cambron-copie. Wherewith, as far as Gratian agreed, he approued him: he approued him not, in that he disagreed from it. Neither is it any discredit to Pamelius, to haue rather folowed that copie, then Gratian: sith Gratian hath missed sometimes (as we graunt) in citing of the Fathers; perhaps by setting down not so much their wordes as that which he conceiued to be meant thereby. But these are small matters, whereto you picke quarrels in the print of Cyprian, at Rome, or at Anwerpe; for this, or that correction: that you may séeme to haue some pretense yet, why you refuse tryall by the consent of the Fathers in controuersies of religion.

Now, the Cambron-copie what is it, or whence came it, that Cyprian should be made the father of such slippes vpon the credit of it alone? What, if some did note them in the margent, of fansie, as students vse to doo? What if some receiued them into the text of errour? What if some, of zeale

vnto the church of Rome, did adde them? And why did not Pamelius leaue out the other words of the equalitie of the Apostles in honor and power, because the Cambron copie wanteth them: as well as adde these of Peters primacie and chaire, because the Cambron-copie hath them? Did not his conscience tell him, that the copie was vnsound: or at the least insufficient, to force the change of a place of so great importance against the credite of so many both writen bookes and printed? If other Licentiates as learned as Pamelius; shall vpon one copie, as good as the Cambron; presume, in all the Fathers, as he hath in Cypriā; to adde the like gloses, for the rest of your opinions, as these are for the chaire and primacie of Peter: it will be hie time for vs to take héede how wee permitte the tryall of controuersies in religion to the consent of the Fathers. Wherfore, although these matters seeme neuer so small, yet there may lie as much on them, as concerneth the safety of our soules. Neither doo I picke them, as quarrels, for pretense; but I alleage them as reasons for proofe, that, by the position of your owne author, we must deale with you not by their consent, but by the scripture onely. For he, on whom you groūded, Vincentius Lirinensis, alloweth onely scripture, to conuince those errors which haue encreased long, & wide: because the length of time hath geuen them occasion to steale away the trueth; and (the poyson spreading farther) they endeuour to corrupt the writings of the Fathers. Your error of the Papacie hath spread farre, and growen long: you haue endeuoured to corrupt the writinges of the Fathers: the forgeries are plaine in Cyprian, in Cyrill, and in the Councell of Chalcedon: the presumptions are great that you haue beene as bold with other, as with these. For if Thomas of Aquine made no conscience of it, what may be thought of such as were more ambitious? And if Manutius dealt so with Cyprian, in

in Monasteries, and Abbeys, they folowed one another with lesser shame, and greater loosenes; and so did proceede, from good to euill, from euill to worse; and authors of that age did most approue those copies, which made for their aduauntage most, and brought authorities out of them. To conclude therefore, euen by his iudgement to whom you appealed, Vincentius Lirinensis, in that golden booke against the profane innouations of all heresies: the touchstone, by the which our controuersie must be tryed, is the word of God, and not the word of men; not the consent of Fathers, but the holy scripture, and the scripture only. And this (I may protest) I speake not of feare, as though the Fathers all held with you against vs: but of conscience, that I may yeelde due glory to God, due reuerence to his word. For, let such forgeries, as I haue spoken of, be set apart:

                  Ierom teacheth, that Peter was chosen, one, among the twelue, to the intēt that (a head being appointed) occasion of scisme might bee taken away.

               These sayings, and the like, which are alleaged out of the Fathers, doo touch three prerogatiues which they giue

to Peter: the first of authoritie, the second of primacie, the third of principalitie. But none of them all doth proue the supremacy which you pretend to Peter, and meane to the Pope. For, by tha

               Rainoldes.
               But none of the sayings alleaged out of the Fathers, doe geue this soueraine power to Peter. Therfore they proue not his pretended supremacie.
            
            
               Hart.
               They geue it him all.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I wil shew the contrary. And to speake in order of the three prerogatiues, which by them are geuen him: the first, out of Ierom, that Peter was of great authoritie, is nothing to your purpose. For, it is apparaunt, that, sith the supremacie dooth note a soueraine power, the question is of power, and not of authoritie.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               As who say, that power and authoritie did differ so much, one from the other.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Much. For, power importeth a right of rule and gouernment, which the superiors haue ouer their inferiors for the good ordering of mankind: as

For they, of whom we think so well in respect of their vertue, or wisdome, or state, or other qualities, that we will folow them as authors in our dooings, our iudgements, factes, or words: are said to be of credite, and authoritie, with vs. And this an inferior may haue with his superior. As

                  Gamaliel, a Pharise, had such authoritie with the Iewes, that the hie priest, and the whole assemblie, did yéelde to his aduise, and, as it were, obeyed him. Wherefore, the authoritie which Ierom saith that Peter had, dooth not prooue a power, much lesse a supremacie.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Yet oftentimes [authoritie] is taken for the same

that [power:] as, when a thing is doon by the appointment and order of the magistrate, wée are w
                     •

               Rainoldes.
               True: because power is one of those qualities which procure authoritie; the greater authoritie, the better that the power is vsed. And so I ioyned power and authoritie together, 
                     Chap. 3. Diuis. 1. when I spake of the keies, that Christ did geue to Peter. But, although the words be taken for the same in a

So 
                     Philip. 3. Autoritas tribuenda est.
                   
                  Tully, when he tolde the Senatours of Rome, that they ought to geue autoritie to Cesar and the rest against Antonie: he meant by autoritie, lawfull power and right to deale against him as against an enemie. But otherwhere,

                   intreating of foure things, which should be in a Generall of an army, skill, vertue, autoritie, felicitie: he meant, not lawful power by autoritie, but estimation, that a Generall must bee honorably thought of by frends and foes. The difference betwéene them hée shewed, where 
                     In Pisonem.
                   he saide, that Metellus, 
                  
                     Priuatus fieri vetuit, atque id quod nondum potestate poterat, obtinuit autoritate.
                   
                  a priuate man, (though chosen Consul. for the yéere folowing) forbadde certain playes, when an officer had allowed them, and that which hee could not yet obteine by power, hee did obteine by autoritie.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               The thinges doo differ, I graunt. But séeing that the name of autoritie is vsed as well for power sometimes, as for estimation: why should it be taken in S. Ieroms words, rather for estimation, as you wil haue it; then for power, as I?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Because the point, which Ierom dooth therevpon inferre, cannot agree to power, but to estimation: yea, this word it selfe is expressed by him, and sheweth that he meant it. For he saith, that Paul went vp to Ierusalem to conferre of the gospel with them that were

approued by these: yet the authoritie which he giueth Peter, he giueth other Apostles, Iames, and Iohn, with him: and therfore a preeminence in estimation, not in power; not in supremacie, but in credit. For, if by [authoritie] he meant supreme power: Iames and Iohn should haue it ouer the Apostles, as well as Peter had. But they (you say) were equall in power to the rest, and inferior to Peter. Then Ierom, by [authoritie] which he gaue to Peter, meant not the supremacie.
            
            
               Hart.
               The primacie of Peter doth proue it more forcibly: which is the next prerogatiue. And that is giuen to him, not only by S. Austin, but also by S. Cyprian, as I haue declared.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               What néede you to alleage me S. Austin, and S. Cyprian? Did I denie his primacie?
            
            
               Hart.
               Why? Doo you not deny it?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               If I doo: let me be smitten, not with the blunt weapon of the words of men (for so I may iustly terme them in this comparison:) but with the sharpe two-edged sword of Gods word. For, 
                     Mat. 10.2. it is writen in S. Matthewes gospell: these are the names of the twelue Apostles; the first is Simon, called Peter. Now, if he were the first: then he had the primacie. For although the reason be not so plaine in English, because we haue not a fit word deriued from our English [first] as 
                     Primatus.
                   primacie is deriued from the [Primus. 
                  first] in Latin: yet they who know reason will neuer deny, but that he that is first, hath the first
                        •
                     ship (if I might speake so) that is to say, the primacie. But this is such a primacie, as a foreman of the Quest is wont to haue in Iuries: not a primacie of power, as ouer inferiours; but a primacie of order, as amongst equals.
            
            
               Hart.
               The primacie of order is a colourable shew, wherby you may auoid S. Matthew. But Austin and Cyprian cannot be so auoided. For their wordes are witnesses, they meant a farther primacie: and what should that be, but a primacie of power? Which because they learned (as it is likely) out of S. Matthew: therof do I gather, that S. Matthew meant a primacie of power, and not of order onely.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               And because S. Matthew, (as it is more likely) meant not a primacie of power to one there, where 
                     Mat. 10.5. he sheweth that Christ gaue the same power to all the Apostles: thereof doo I gather that he meant a primacie of order onely, not of power.
                  
But Austin and Cyprian meant a farther primacie, you say. Perhaps they did. Therefore a primacie in power? It doth not folow. Nay, it is manifest, they meant it not of power.

                  equall power to all the Apostles. The truth is, they meant a primacie in calling: to wéet, that

                  Cyprian doth speake expressely. And whether S. Matthew regarded this also, in that he numbred Peter, first: I can not define. But whether hée did, or no; it is no farther primacie then I graunted you by the foreman of the Quest: who is called first, as he is reckened fi

               Hart.
               A primacie in calling? Nay yet you had done better to haue cleaued still to the primacie of order. For Peter, in order was the first in déed: and so I deny not but he might haue béene, though he had bene equall in power to his brethren. But he was not the first in calling.

                     De baptism. contr. Donat. l. 2. c. 1. 
                  Austins words, [the primacie of the Apostles is conspicuous and preeminent with excellent grace in Peter,] doo plainely import, that he meant a primacie not in calling, but preeminence.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               You say that Peter had not a primacie in calling: for S. Ambrose saith so. What, if I should answere, Hee had a primacie in calling: for S. Cyprian saith so. Or, to helpe S. Cyprian (if he haue smaller credit with you,) for S. 
                  
                     In Ezechielem homil. 18. 
                  Gregory saith so: 
                     Primus in Apostolatum vocatus.
                   
                  Peter was called to the Apostleship first. But there is no dissension betwéene them and Ambrose, if all their wordes be weighed. For Ambrose saith, that Andrew did first folowe Christ: and they say, that Peter was called first of Christ. The truth of both which is plaine by the scriptures. For 
                     Iohn 1. ver. 40. 
                  Andrewe folowed Christ, before Peter knewe him: and he brought Peter vnto Christ. But 
                     ver. 42. 
                  Christ said to Peter,
                  
                     Comment. in epist. ad Gal. cap. 1. 
                  Thou shalt be called Cephas, (wherein he meant him the Apostleship,) before hee spake a word of the Apostleship to Andrewe. And so doth Ambrose séeme him selfe to expound his meaning otherwhere: affirming of Peter, that 
                     Primus erat inter Apostolos, cui Saluator delegauerat curam ecclesiarum.
                   
                  he was the first among the Apostles to whom our Sauiour had committed the charge of the churches.
                  
Whereby he giueth Peter ye 
                  primacie in being called to the Apostleship: thogh he gaue a primacie in discipleship (as it were) I meane, in folowing Christ, to Andrew. As for S. Austins words, which (you say) import that he meant a primacie, notin calling, but preeminēce: you should haue rather said yt he meant a primacie, in calling, & preeminence both. For out of al doubt he meant a primacie in calling. But your fréends, who dismember the sayings of the Fathers, doo stand in your light, that you can not sée it. For as 
                     Princip. doctr. lib. 6. cap. 13. 
                  Stapleton did cut out 
                     Quia primus erat inter Apostolos. And so he leaneth Ambrose to say, that it was meet Paule should desire to see Peter, to whom our Sauiour had committed the charge of the churches. As if to him alone: not to the rest of the Apostles. the former wordes of Ambrose, that Peter might be thought the onely man who had the charge of the churches, not the first of them who had it: so hath Torrensis cut of the later words of Austin, that the primacie of Peter might be thoght a primacie in power, not in calling; or, if in calling, in power too. The primacie of the Apostles is conspicuous and praeeminent with excellent grace in the Apostle Peter: thus saith Torrensis out of Austin. And these are 
                     De baptism. contr. Donatist. lib. 2. cap. 1. 
                  Austins wordes: but his words say farther, that Peter the Apostle, in whom that grace and primacie are so preeminent, 
                  
                     A posteriore apostolo Paulo esse correctum.
                   
                  was corrected by Paule a later Apostle. Wherein, naming Paule, [a later Apostle,] as made Apostle, after Peter, in time: he sheweth,
                     Confession. Augustinian. lib. 1. cap. 9. tit. 1. that of the other side he meant by [the primacie,] yt 
                  Peter was an Apostle, in time, before Paule. As Ambrose saith of the chiefest of the Apostles, that they were before Paule, 
                  
                     Non dignitate, sed tempore.
                   
                  not in dignitie, but in time. And 
                     Epist. 71. ad Quintum.
                   
                  Cyprian (whom Austin alleageth, and foloweth) doth vse the worde [Vt diceretse primatum tenete: et obtēperari a nouellis & posteris sibi potius oportere. 
                  primacie] in the same sense of being first in time also. Wherefore, the Fathers proue not your supremacie by giuing the prerogatiue of primacie to Peter.
                  
                     Comment. in 2. epist. ad Cor. cap. 12.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               The bare name of primacie is not enough to prooue it. But some by that name haue meant a supremacie. And surely, the preeminence with excellent grace, which Austin giueth Peter, doth note a higher primacie, then either of order, or calling, or time: though it with all too.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               It doth so, I graunt. And I noted that, in the third prerogatiue which the Fathers giue him: namely, principalitie. For 
                     De bapt. contr. Donatist. lib. 2. cap. 1. 
                  Austin, hauing ioined his primacie and preeminence with excellent grace togither, doth terme them both, in one, 
                     Principatum apostolatus.
                   
                  the principalitie of the Apostleship. Which if some haue meant by the name of primacie, as perhaps they haue: they

might, because the word is borowed often times from the proper signification of the first in order, to signifie the chiefe in quality. And so, when 
                     In Iohannem Tractat. 124. 
                  Austin saith, that Peter was 
                     Natura vnus homo, gratia vnus Christianus abundantiori gratia v

                  a man by nature; a Christian by grace; by more aboundant grace, an Apostle of Christ, yea, the first Apostle: by, the first Apostle, he meant the chiefe Apostle; the principalitie, by the primacie. But this principalitie of the Apostleship, this preeminence of the primacie with grace so excellent and aboundant, cometh no néerer vnto your supremacie then did the primacie of order. For, to be chiefe in grace, is one thing: and, to be chiefe in power, an other.
            
            
               Hart.
               And is it not a great grace, to be chiefe in power?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               As you say: the greatest grace, that your Popes of long time haue fought for. Yet there is a difference betwéene grace and power. Which the Popes

                  grace of the holy Ghost, then sundry Popes, saith Gratian: yet in the deciding of controuersies and causes the writings of the Doctors are of lesse authoritie then the Popes decrees. Why? because the Popes are in

                  in power of iurisdiction (he saith) the Pope is greater. Wherfore if the Popes supremacie do stand in power of iurisdiction, and a woman may be aboue him in grace: then Peter might excel with the preeminence of grace, as Austin saith he did: and yet not excel in supremacie of power, which you conclude of it. Else, you must take the supremacie from Peter, and giue it to the blessed virgin. Unlesse you you will deny that she excelled

him in grace.
            
            
               Hart.
               I will not deny it. Neither did I meane to prooue the supremacy by the preeminence of grace, alone, in Peter: but by the preeminence of so excellent grace, concurring with the primacy. Whereto, because you think these priuileges (touched by Austin) doo not prooue it: the title of the Prince of the Apostles, which As the Rhemistes say, In the argum. of the epist. of S. Peter: concluding thereof, that Christ made him his vicar.
                   all antiquitie geueth him, may adde weight and strength.

For must he not be needes the Prince of the Apostles, to whom the principalitie of the Apostleship is allowed? And if the principalitie of the Apostleship inferre not your supremacie: can you inferre a supreme head by the Prince of the Apostles?

                  Ierom, was prince of the philosophers, so was Peter of the Apostles. Wherefore, this is all you may conclude of it, that Peter did excell amongst the Apostles, for grace and giftes of grace: as Plato did excell among the Philosophers for witte, and giftes of witte. In the which conclusion (that you may perceiue what I geue to Peter, and refuse it, if you mislike it:) by the giftes of grace I meane all the blessings, wherewith the Lord did honour him; by excelling in them, I meane that he did passe, not all the Apostles in them all, but euery one in some or other. For Iohn, the disciple, whom the Lord loued, who wrote the Gospell so diuinely, In the beginning was the worde, who sawe by reuelation the things that were to come, and wrote them by the spirite of prophecie: Iohn excelled Peter in many giftes of grace, as

                   by Ieroms opiniō) to be the chief of the Apostles. And this is it, which Ierom, and other Fathers meant by Peters principalitie: if you will geue them leaue to be their owne interpreters. They did not meane to call him Prince of the Apostles, as the Pope desireth to bee Prince of Bishops.

               They did meane to call him the mouth, and the top, the highest, the President, and the head of the Apostles. For these, (as I haue shewed) are their own wordes, by which, a preeminence in gouernment is prooued, and not in grace onely.

                  the highest (and so the toppe it may be too,) séeme to haue béene meant rather of preeminence in grace, then in gouernment. But if you will referre them vnto both: it skilleth not. For they can betoken no more then the rest. And the rest doo signifie, although a preeminence in gouernment, such as it is: yet nothing in comparison of your supremacie.

                     Chapter. 4. Diuision 1. when wee spake of the practise of Peters autoritie in the Actes of the Apostles. For when I graunted him to be as the Speaker of ye Parlament in England, or the President of a court of Parlament in Fraunce, and shewed the great difference (out of

Duar. de sacris eccle. min. acbene. l. 3. c. 2. a lawier of your owne) betweene this preeminence, and that supremacie which you claime: you reiected the lawier, as either ignorant, or vnfaithful, and refused this préeminence as not importing that supremacie; because it hath not soueraine power, nay, in power is vnder the body of the assembly, aboue which it is in a prerogatiue of honor. Yet, this preeminence, is all, that is geuen to Peter by the titles of the mouth, the head, the President of the Apostles. Wherefore, it is euident that by those titles your Papall supremacie is not geuen to him.

               It may by your similitudes be probably thoght, yt some of ye rest might note such a preeminēce in gouernment (as you

speake of) without a souerainty of power. But, ye title of head hath greater strength in it. For, the Speaker is not called with vs, in England, the head of the Parlament. That title is reserued to the Princ e alone.

And did they not appoint this one, to be the chiefe, and head of their company, that occasion of strife might be taken away? So fared it with Peter amongst the Apostles in gouerning the church, whose state if wée compare with the states of common wealths, we shall finde that it was an aristocratie, not a monarchie, as the Philosophers terme it; not hauing Peter as a Prince, but the Apostles as the best men,

to gouerne it in common. Yet, as in all assemblies wherein many méete about affaires of gouernment, there must néedes be one for orders sake and peace, to beginne, to end, to moderate the actions: so was that preeminence geuen to Peter amongst the Apostles, that all things might be done peaceably and orderly. And this to be the headship which S. Ierom meant, himself 
                        Hieron. aduer. sus Iouin. lib. 2. in that very place, in which he toucheth it, dooth shew manifestly. For, hauing set downe his aduersaries obiection: But, thou saiest, the church is built vpon Peter: he answereth thereto, Although the same be done in another place

                        Cuncti claues regni coelorum accipiant.
                      
                     they all receiue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, & the strength of the church is grounded on them 
                     
                        Ex aequo.
                      equally: yet therefore is one chosen amongst the twelue, that (a head being appointed) occasion of schisme may be taken away. Of the which sentence the former branch sheweth yt by the name of head, vsed in the later, he could not meane that Peter had a soueraine power ouer the Apostles. For all Peters power is comprised in the keies that Christ did promise him, and in the building of the church vpon him. But all the Apostles receiue the keyes, by Ieroms iudgement: and the church is builte vpon them all equally. Wherfore by Ieroms iudgement, Peter was not ouer the Apostles in power. If not in power; & yet in part of gouernment: in what, but in that preeminence, which I spake of? S. Ierom therefore, saying, that Peter was appointed head of the Apostles, did meane that preeminence among the Apostles, and not a soueraintie aboue them.
            
            
               Hart.
               The wordes of S. Ierom doo speake somewhat too liberally of the Apostles, in that he saith the church is built vpon them all equally. And, as D.

                   the distinction touching things writen by the Fathers, some by way of doctrine, and some of contention, is verified in them. For here, by occasion that he reasoneth against Iouinian, who alleaged (against the honour of virginitie) that Christ preferred Peter, a maried man, before the rest: he doth lessen and extenuate the authority of Peter, (as farre as truth did giue him leaue,) making the rest equall to him for the Apostleship; yet affirming plainely, that he was head of the rest.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  Ierom wrote many things in déed against Iouinian by way of contention rather, then of doctrine, to the disgrace

of marriage. In so much that

                  Pammachius, a learned gentleman, his fréend, did suppresse the copies, and wished them to be concealed till he had corrected them. But neither was this place so reproued by them, or excused by him, for ought that may be gathered by his apologie: nor is it to be noted, as sauouring more of heate, then truth; for the substance of it agreeth with the scriptures. Yea Stapleton, who couereth it with this distinction, confesseth in effect as much at vnawares: For, he saith that 
                     Extenuat Hieronymus (quantum per ueritat
                           •
                        m licuit) Petri autoritatem.
                   
                  Ierom doth lessen and extenuate the authoritie of Peter, as far as truth did giue him leaue. Wherof it ensueth, that it is no vntrueth to say (as Ierom doth) that all the Apostles had equall power with Peter. The name of head therefore, which Ierom giueth him with the same breath, can by no meanes import a soueraine power ouer ye Apostles. Unlesse you will make him so absurd, and brainesicke, as that he should say: Though none of the Apostles were soueraine of the rest, but they had equall power all; yet was one of them aboue the rest in power, and had the souerain-headship of them.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Wel. Howsoeuer you handle Ieroms wordes: he saith in flat termes that which you denyed. And therefore he maketh against you with vs.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               In what point? Or how?
            
            
               Hart.
               You denied that Peter was head of the Apostles. Ierom saith, he was. Peter was not head: and Peter was head. Is there not a contradiction betwéene your words, and his?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               No more, then betwéene the wordes of Iohn and Christ Christ said of Iohn Baptist: 
                  
                     Mat. 11.14, 
                  this is Elias. Iohn Baptist said of him selfe, 
                     Iohn 1.21. 
                  I am not Elias. Iohn Baptist is Elias: and Iohn Baptist is not Elias. Is there not a contradiction betwéen the words of Christ and Iohn?
            
            
               Hart.
               No. For Christ meant one way: and Iohn Baptist, an other. Christ, that he was Elias in spirit; as coming 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      1.17. in the spirit and power of Elias: Iohn Baptist, that he was not Elias in person; which the Pharisees meant.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               You haue answered well. So Ierom meant one way: and I an other. Ierom, that he was head in a preeminence of gouernment; as moderating the actions in assemblies of the Apostles:

I, that he was not head in soueraintie of power; which the Papists meane. And thus, to conclude, you may see that the Fathers whom you alleage for Peter: some giue him a prerogatiue of authoritie, some of primacie, some of principalitie, but none of your supremacie. For, your supremacie doth consist in power: and they giue equall power to Peter with the rest.
            
            
               Hart.
               
                  Equall power (I graunt) in respect of the Apostleship, but not of pastoral charge. For Peter was ouer thē in that, euen as the Pope is ouer Bishops. And so

                     Chapt. 3. Diuis. 1. alreadie that Peters pastorall charge, and his Apostleship, is al one: and therefore, if they were equall to him in the Apostleship, the were in pastorall charge too. But if no other reason will put you to silence: the Popes own authority may force you to it here. For, in the Cyprian set forth by him at Rome,

                   he noteth it to be considered, that, whereas Cyprian saith, The rest of the Apostles had equall power with Peter, this must be vnderstood

                  of the equalitie of Apostleship, which ceased when the Apostles died, and passed not ouer vnto Bishops. The drift of which note implieth a distinction of Apostles, and Bishops: that it is not with Bishops in respect of the Pope, as it was with the Apostles in respect of Peter.

               You knowe not who made that note in the Roman Cyprian: for there is no mans name to it. But if the Pope either made it him selfe, or allowed of it being made by others to whom he did commit that charge: he set down (as a priuate Doctor) his owne opinion, which they who list may folow. But this is my opinion, which I haue set downe: and to that I stand.

               I am glad you thinke not as the Pope doth, at least, in one point. God graunt, that you may come forward in the rest: to dissent from him, not in this one point alone, but in many. Howbeit whether he, or others made that note: they set it forth with greater authoritie and priuilege, then as a priuate Doctors fansie. Neither is it likely that they would haue graunted

so much to the Apostles, vnlesse the truth had wroong it from them. Let your righteousnes, M. Hart, if not exceede, yet match the righteousnes of Scribes and Pharisees: and yéeld to this conclusion (which riseth of our conference,) that Peter was not head of all the Apostles, as you do take the name of head.

            The sixth Chapter. The two maine groundes, on which the supremacie vsurped by the Pope, doth lie. The former, that there should be one Bishop ouer all in earth: 1 because Christ said, There shall be one flocke, and one pastor; 2 and among the Iewes there was one iudge, and hie Priest. The later, that the Pope is that one Bishop: 3 because Peter was Bishop of Rome, (as some say,) 4 and the Pope succeedeth Peter. Both examined, and shewed to faile in the proofe of the Popes supremacie.

                     Mat. 21.29. he, who said he would not goe into the vineyarde, repented afterward, and went: so you may yéeld to this on better aduise, to which you say you will not yéeld. Though, if your opinion of Peters supremacie were graunted to be true: it proueth not your title to the Popes supremacie (the principall point in question) which you claime thereby.

               Because that the power committed to Peter was not to dye with Peter. For this had not bene agréeable to the goodnes and wisedom of Christ: vpō whom it lay to prouide for his church vntill the end of the world, as

               It is proued by Austin that our Sauiour Christ prouided for his church. And this (I graunt) he did by giuing seueral Pastors vnto seuerall flockes: but so, that he committed the charge of them all to one supreme Pastor; which is the Bishop of Rome.

                  there shal be one flocke, and one shepheard, or (as we translate it) one folde and one Pastor. 
                  
                     Staplet▪ princip doct. lib. 6. cap. 15. whereof I make this reason. By the name of Pastor is noted an ordinarie gouernment and charge, which hath relation to a flocke: and therefore, as long as the flocke continueth, the Pastors office must continue; the office of one Pastor, as the flocke is one. It continued in Peter, when Christ made him supreme Pastor. Now, when Peter dyed, it should continue in his successor. And the successor of Peter is the Bishop of Rome. The Bishop of Rome therefore is the supreme Pastor of the Church of Christ.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I perceiue your Pope can make no shew of title to supreme-headship of the Church, vnlesse he put Christ from the possession of it. For Christ by [one Pastor] doth signifie himselfe: as it may appeare by the drift of all his spéech, wherein he maintaineth his office and autoritie

               Him selfe alone (I graunt) directly, and first: but secondarily, and by consequent, his vicar too, Peter, and Peters successor. For Christ, while he liued in flesh vpon the earth, did not bring the Gentiles: 
                     Mat. 15.24, 
                  he was not sent (he saide) but to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. In the which respect S. Paul calleth him 
                     Rom. 15.8. ye 
                  minister of circumcision, because he did execute his office, and ministery, onely towardes the people of circumcision, that is, the Iewes. The Gentiles he did bring after his ascension, by the ministerie of his seruants, chiefly of S. Peter: whom 
                     Act. 10.11. hauing instructed by a vision from heauen, hée sent him to Cornelius, & 
                     Act. 15.7. 
                  chose him that the Gentiles should heare by his mouth the worde of the Gospell, and beleeue. Wherefore, as Christ saide, that he must bring the Gentiles, though he meant to bring them not by his owne preaching, but by the mouth of Peter; and so Peter brought them after a sorte too: likewise he gaue him selfe the name of one Pastor, though he fedde his flocke not in his owne person, but in his vicar; and so might hée meane his vicar too thereby.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               This is a greater argument, that he meant not Peter, nor Peters successor (as you terme him) by the name of one Pastor. For if he meant him selfe, not as hee liued in the flesh, but as he

                   raigneth in glorie: then meant he that prerogatiue which is onely his, as 
                     vers. 22. 
                  head of the Church, and may be no way giuen vnto flesh and blood. For the proofe whereof we are to weigh farther, that in saying 
                     Ioh. 10. ver. 16 
                  I must bring them, & they shall heare my voyce: he meaneth effectuall bringing, and hearing, through which they, who are 
                     ver. 4. & 27.

                     ver. 28. 
                  he doth giue them eternall life, and they shall neuer perish: and none shall plucke them out of his hand. Now, whom Christ bringeth after this maner, he bringeth them by two meanes: by the preaching of his worde, and the working of his Spirite. As he worketh by his Spirite: so he hath no vicar, him selfe doth 
                     Act. 16.14. 
                  open the heart of Lydia: and

                     Mat. 28.20. 
                  is with his disciples still vntil the end of the worlde. As he calleth by his worde: so are all ministers of the worde, his vicars. For hee

sendeth them in his steede, and preacheth vnto men by them. So he saith to the 
                     Mat. 10.40. twelue Apostles, He that receiueth you, receiueth me: and to the 
                     Luc. 10.16. seuentie disciples, He that heareth you, heareth me. So Paule saith of

Cor. 5.20. him selfe, Timothee, Siluanus, and the rest that laboured with him, We are embassadours for Christ, God as it were beseeching you through vs: we pray you in Christes steed, be ye reconciled to God. First therefore, sith the Spirite doth make the word effectuall, and Christ hath no vicar, as he worketh by his Spirite: it foloweth, yt in naming him selfe, ye 
                  one Pastor, who doth bring his sheep, and they heare his voice, he could imply no vicar. For the word doth sound in vaine to the eare, vnlesse the Lord doo open the heart with his Spirite: and 1. Cor. 3.7. 
                  neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giueth the encrease. Againe, if he had implied their ministerie, by whom the shéepe heare his voice, and so are brought: yet must that belong to many vicars, not to one; or if to one, not to Peter. For they, who should be brought thereby, are the Gentiles: and Christ hath brought the Gentiles by many

                  Pastors and teachers, not only by the Apostles: nor amongst the Apostles by Peter chiefely, but by

                     Gal. 2.9. their agréement betwéene them selues. Finally, if Christ had meant (as you distinguish it) him selfe first, and directly; secondarily, & by cōsequent Peter: it must be for his preaching ye word to the flocke.

                  it is necessarie for euery man vnto saluation, to be subiect to the Pope: and that they, who say hee hath not charge ouer them, are not of Christs sheepe, because the Lord saith in Iohn, that there shall be one flocke and one pastour.

               You néede not account it so heinous a matter to conclude that doctrine by these wordes of Christ. Chiefely, sith it is probable, that he meant them rather of the Pope then him selfe. For he saith, there shall be one flocke and one Pastor: he saith not, there hath beene; but, there shall be. Now him selfe, as being God, was alway Pastor of the Gentiles also, no lesse thē of the Iewes. And so in respect of him there had before bene one flocke, and one pastor. Wherfore sith he speaketh of a thing that should be, not that had bene alreadie: he might be well

thought to haue meant not him selfe but the Pope rather, who (in his stéed) is Pastor both of Iewes and Gentiles.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Had the Gentiles alway God for their Pastor, as well as the Iewes? What meant S. Paule then, who saith, 
                     Eph. 2.12. to the Gentiles: ye were without Christ, and aliants from the common wealth of Israell, and straungers from the couenants of promise, and had no hope, and were without God in the world? For 
                     Psal. 23.1. & 80.1. 
                  God is called Pastor, in respect of them, whom he guideth, and feedeth with the foode of life. So that if he were Pastor of the Gentiles alway, as you say he was: then they were alway faithfull, and members of the Church, and had the hope of God in Christ. But if they were before without Christ, without hope, without God in the world, and aliants from the common wealth of Israell, that is, the Church, and straungers from the couenants of promise made to the faithfull, as they were, S. Paule saith: then neither were they one flocke with the Iewes, neither was God their one Pastor. wherfore what

                  oeuer shew of probabilitie the Pope might séeme to haue for abusing those wordes to maintaine his own pride: in truth they agree to him, 
                     Eph. 2.14. who broke the stoppe of the partition-wall, and made of both one, that is to Christ Iesus, and onely to Christ.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Well. If the wordes agree not to the Pope perhaps in one sense: they may in an other. For there are sundry senses of the holy scriptures, but in generall two, as 
                     Robert. Bellarmin. in lection. Roman. con

                        . 1. quest. 5. Father Robert sheweth whereof the one is called historicall, or literall; the other, mysticall, or spirituall. And so the spéech of Christ touching one Pastor, might signifie the Pope in a mysticall sense, though not in the literall. As likewise the name of hye priest, signifying the Iewish literally, doth mystically betoken him.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               That sense is the right sense of the scriptures, which the holy Ghost, the author of them, meant. Now, the holye Ghost hath vttered them in such sort, that not the wordes onely do signifie things, according to their naturall sense: but the things also expressed by the wordes do signifie other things, according to the Lordes ordinance, who shadowed that by figures in the olde Testament, which is performed in the newe. As, for example, it is writen in 
                     Exod. 12.46. the law of Moses, you shall not breake a bone of him. These wordes are spoken touching the lambe of the passeouer:

and signifie, as they sound, that the Iewes should dresse it whole, without breaking any bone thereof. But this thing doth signifie a fa
                     •
                  ther thing in secret: to wéete, that when 
                     Iohn 19.3
                        •
                     . 
                  Christ, who was represented & figured by the lambe, should suffer death to saue vs, a bone of him should not be broken. Thus, of one place there are two senses: the former called literall, because the letter, as it were that is the very wordes, being vnderstood aright, do import it; and the later, mysticall, because the thing imported and meant by the letter, doth betoken a déeper mysterie. Of these, the literall sense is knowne to be the meaning of the holy Ghost. For wordes were made to open the conceites of our mind: and so are they vsed by the holy Ghost to shew the will of God vnto vs. The mysticall is known to be his meaning also, when himselfe reuealeth it: as he hath done in that touching the lambe. Otherwise it is not. For men may deuise many mysticall senses of a place in scripture, and them, one contrarie to an other: as often times they doo. Which all could not be meant by the Spirit of truth: and whether any of them were, who can say? We haue no assurance then of mysticall senses: which may be mens fansies. Onely the literall sense, which is meant vndoubtedly by the holy Ghost, is of force to proue the assured truth, and therefore doth binde in matters of beliefe. And this is so cléere that

                  that forcible aguments ought to be drawne onely from the literall sense: and that is surely knowne to be the sense and meaning of the holy Ghost. As for mystical senses, it is not alwaies sure, whether the holy Ghost meant them: vnlesse they be expounded in the scriptures, as that in Iohn, you shall not breake a bone of him.

Wherefore if it be not expounded in the scriptures, that the wordes of Christ (touching one Pastor) are meant, as of him selfe, by the literall sense; so, by the mystical, of the Pope: you sée that Father Robert saith, it is a folly, to go about to proue the Popes supremacie by them, if you will proue it forcibly. Now, what I say of one Pastour: the same I say of high Priest. By whom, 
                     Exod. 28.4. the law of Moses doth signify the hye priest, literally: 
                     Heb. 8.5. the epistle to the Hebrewes doth shew that mystically he betokened Christ. But

that the Pope was meant by him in any sense eyther literall or mysticall: I finde not in the scriptures.

               Hart.
               The place, which I alleaged, doth plainely speake of the high Priest: and so it doth serue my purpose more fitly, then this, which doth not touch him. Howbeit, as learned men, when they haue proued a point by stronger arguments, are wont to set it foorth with floorishes of lighter reasons, rather to polishe it as it were, then to worke it and frame it: so the Pope hauing brought better euidence for proofe of his supremacie, doth trimme it vp with this of Genesis, as you would say, by an allusion.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  An illusion, you should say. But the places both, as well this of Genesis, as that of Deuteronomie, are taken in a mysticall sense of your owne: so that to winne a matter which must be wunne by sound proofe, they are both of like force, because that neyther is of any. For the literall sense of that in Deuteronomie doth concerne the Iewes: to whom the Lorde spake it by his seruant Moses. Now, how dangerous it is to buyld, as vpon scripture, thinges, which are not grounded vpon ye literal sense thereof: we may learne by the mysticall sense of that place, which a Pope giueth; and no common Pope, but Innocentius the third, the Father of the Lateran-councel, in which your popish Shrift and Transsubstantiation were enacted first. He, in a decretal (which is enrolled in ye

(that is, of Rome:) whose determination if any man presumptuously refuse to obey, he is adiudged to dye, that is, to be cut off, as a dead man, from the communion of the faithfull by excommunication. Lo: this is a mysticall sense of that place, which you alleaged out of Deuteronomie. It runneth verie roundly with the Popes supremacie. But Christian States (I hope) will hold the literall sense against it. For if they allow this doctrine of Pope Innocentius, as catholike: the Pope must be supreme head of all Christians, both in ecclesiasticall causes and ciuill. The 2. Thess. 2.7. 
                  mysterie of iniquitie did worke verie fast, when the chiefest mysteries of the Romish faith were built vpon such mystical senses.
            
            
               Hart.
               I know that the misticall senses of the scripture are of no strength to conuince an aduersarie. But the literall sense of that which I alleaged doth proue the point in question. For there lyeth often times, within the literall, an other sense hidden: which is not directly vttered, and plainely, but is gathered and inferred by the force of argument. As, for example, 
                     Exod. 3.6. God said to comfort Moses and the Israelites, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. These wordes in the first sense, doo signifie the couenant that God made with Abraham and with Abrahams seede, whom hée chose to be his seruants, and promised he would bée their God. But 
                     Mat. 22.32. Christ alleageth them to proue (against the Sadduces) the resurrectiō of the dead. Which he doth conclude by consequēce of reason. God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing. He is the God of Abraham
                  ▪ Therefore Abraham is not dead. Abraham is a man consisting of two partes, the soule and the bodie. If Abraham then liue, and yet his bodie be dead: his bodie must rise againe, to the end that God may iustly be called the God, not of Abrahams soule, but of Abraham. Wherefore, in that God is called the God of Abraham, it followeth (by discourse) that the bodies of men shall bée raysed from death to life. Is not this reason conteined in the literall sense of the scripture, from which it is deduced?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Yes: and is of force to proue the point in controuersie. For whatsoeuer followeth necessarily of the literall sense: that is as true and sound as the sense, whereof it followeth. But how will you gather so the Popes supremacie from the

place in Deuteronomie.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               By a reason, which I ground vpon the likenes and proportion of the Church of Christ to the children of Israell. For if the Israelites had a high Priest to be their iudge in matters of difficultie and doubt, betweene blood and blood, betweene cause & cause, betweene plague and plague: why should not we semblably haue a hie Priest to bée the iudge in our causes?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               This reasō is drawn from a similitude: that, as it was amongst the Iewes in the olde Testament; so must it bée amongst Christians in the new. Logicians say, that similitudes do halt of one foote. But this doth halt of both. For neither was the high Priest amongst the Iewes, iudge of all those matters: nether doth it follow thereof, although he had béene, that amongst Christians there must a high priest bée likewise iudge of all. Els, it must be lawfull for all your priestes to marry. For 
                     Leuit. 21.7· it was so amongst the Iewes. And Masse must be be saide no where but at Rome. For the Iewes 
                     Deut. 12.14. might not sacrifice, but in the place which the Lord had chosen. And 
                     Deut. 16.16. 
                  all the males, amongst the Iewes, must goe thither euery yeare thrise. Which were ouermuch for all your males, to Rome. Yet must they doo it by your reason. For it is written in Deuteronomie. And because 
                  
                     Deuteronomium: of the greeke words, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  Deuteronomie is the second law by interpretation: the force of the word proueth, that, what is there decreed, ought to be obserued in the new Testament, saith Pope Innocentius.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               The condicion of Christians is not in all respectes like vnto the Iewes, nor Rome vnto Ierusalem. And why it is not like in the matters which you mention: there may bée reasons giuen.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               May there be reasons giuen? Then reasons may be giuen, why your reason is naught. But, that you may sée what a lame thing it is: marke the pointes whereon it standeth. First, the high Priest (you say) is the iudge, to whom, for the deciding of hard and doubtfull controuersies, the Lord doth send the Iewes. This the scripture saith not: but maketh a difference betwéene the iudge and the Priest. For it giueth sentence of death, vpon him, who refuseth to harken

                  to the Priest, or to the iudge. Wherein, by disioyning the Priest from the iudge, it declareth plainely that the Priest was not the same that the iudge.

               But we haue a decree of the Councell of Trent, 
                  
                     Concil. Trident. Session. 4. that our old and common edition in Latin shall be taken as authenticall, in publike lectures, disputations, sermons and expositions: and that

                  no man may dare or presume to reiect it vnder any pretense. If no man may reiect it vnder anye pretense: then not vnder pretense of the Hebrew text. And that for great reason. For the Hebrewe Bibles, which are extant now, are shamefully corrupted in many places by the Iewes, of spite and malice against Christians: as Bishop

Whereby, a notable prophecie describing so plainely the maner and kind of the passion of Christ should bée taken out of our hands through the trechery of the Iewes, if wée should folow the Hebrew text as it is now.

                  Lindan hath of any shew, to proue, that the Iewes haue corrupted the Hebrew text. But if it be weighed with an euen ballance: you shall find it a meere cauill. For what will you say of your owne selues? Did the Church of Rome corrupt the Latin text in the third of Genesis, 
                  
                     Gen. 3.15. where it is read of the woman, she shall bruse thy head: for that which should be read of thewomans séed, he shall bruse thy head?

               Some of your men say so. But they do great iniury to the Church therin.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               They haue as great cause, at least, if not greater, to say this of Romanistes, as you the other of the Iewes. For if▪ we match the prophecies; this is more notable,
                     De opt. gen. interpret. Scrip. lib. 3 cap. 9. which is corrupted in your Latin: of the victorie of Christ ouer Satan, and ours through him. If we compare errors; this is more manifest: in so much that it is proued to be an error euen by Lindan also, not onely by 
                     Augustin. Steuchus in recognit. Genes. ad verit. Heb. Andrad. defens. sid. Trident. lib. 4. others; and the Hebrue text, with the Chaldee paraphrase, and the Greeke translation, do all make against it,

For (in the sixth tome of that worke) he sheweth, that, when the Iewes returned into their countrey after their captiuitie of seuentie yeares in Babylon: it befell vnto them, partly by occasion of their long troubles which did distract their mindes, partly by corruption of their natiue tongue which was growne out of kind, first into the Chaldee and afterward into the Syriake, that they neither knewe nor pronounced so wel the words of the scripture, writen (as the maner was) without vowels. Whereby it came to passe that in the writing of them their crept in some faulte, either through iniury of the times, or by reason of troubles which fell vpon the people, or by negligence of some scriueners. But this inconuenience was met withall afterward by most learned men: such as Esdras was, and afterward Gamaliel, Ioseus, Eleazar, and other of great name: who prouided by common trauell with great care and industry, that the text of scripture and the true reading thereof, should be preserued most sound and vncorrupt. And from these men, or from their instruction, being receaued and poolished by their scholers in the ages folowing, there came (saith he) as we iudge, that most profitable treasure which is called

Now, in this Masoreth, made so long ago, so diligently writen, so faithfully kept, in so many countryes, through so many ages, as Arias Montanus witnesseth, the Iewes them selues acknowledge by their owne testimonie, that where in common bookes it is read Caari, in certaine it is Caaru. Wherefore, if some Iewish scriueners (who wrote out bookes) depraued it of malice, and spite, which might be, though they who accuse them doo bring neither autour, nor time, nor any sure argument to proue it, but if some depraued it: yet, séeing their Masôreth doth note the diuerse reading, and in part doth iustifie that which is the truer: it is hard to charge them (as you doo) with corrupting of the Hebrewe text. Much harder, then if we should charge your Romish church, with corrupting of the Latin, where you read [ipsa] in stéed of [ipse,] not he, but she shall bruse thy head.

               But this was verie rare, & extraordinarie. Now the Law, which God prescribed in Deuteronomie by his seruant Moses, did touch the common state and ordinarie gouernment of the people of Israel. For both it is generall without limitation of persons or times, as to be kept still for the ending of their controuersies, not onely in the dayes of Eli: and it is written, that when king Iosaphat restored the state decayed, 2.

Wherefore séeing that the law in Deuteronomie, was made to establish a highest court of iudgement, in which all harder causes ecclesiasticall and ciuil should be determined without appeale farther: the reason and the practise of the law do shew, that, in respect of the two kinds of causes, there were ordained two sortes of men to heare them, ecclesiasticall, and ciuill; the ciuill meant by the iudge, the ecclesiasticall, by the Priest. Who because they were distinct, as in office, so in person too ordinarily: it followeth thereof, that the Priest was not meant by the iudge.

It may be, M. Hart, that sith you were beyond-sea, they haue bethought them selues: and seeing that your Glosse doth goe against the text, they will no longer stand vnto

it. Indéede, if the supremacie belong to the iudge▪ the Prince hath greater right thereto then the Pope. For it is certaine (as I haue declared by circumstances of the scripture,) that the Priest was not meant by the iudge.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               It skilleth not to my purpose, whether he were, or no. It sufficeth me, that he who refuseth to obey the Priest, must die, by the law. Which is enough to proue the soueraintie of one Priest.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Not so. For the name of Priest (in this law) doth signifie the Priestes. Which is cléere, by reason that the punishment of the transgressor hath a relation to the law: and the law doth will men to go to 
                     Deut. 17.9. 
                  the Priests: the Priestes, it saith, as of many; not, as of one, the hie Priest. Wherefore, in giuing sentence of death against him, who disobeieth the Priest; it meaneth the Priestes: according to

               But here, vpon mention of the Priest, it foloweth: who doth serue the Lord thy God. By the which title the hie Priest may séeme to haue béene namely noted, and seuered from the rest.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               He might so, were it not that the same title is also giuen 
                     ver. 5. afterward to Priestes, generally: yea, where this matter is touched 
                     Deut. 21.5. againe of purpose, the Lord thy God hath chosen the Priestes, the sonnes of Leui, to serue him, and to blesse in the name of the Lorde; and by their word shall euery controuersie, and euery plague be tried.

               Yet you will graunt, (I trust,) that amongst the Priestes there was one chiefe: yea, euen in this matter of highest iudgement in doubtfull causes. Which, (in 2. Chr. 1
                        •
                     .11. the same place of Scripture that you brought to expound this,) is shewed by king Iosaphat: saying vnto them, to whom that iudgement was committed; Amarias the Priest shall be the chiefe ouer you in matters of the Lord.

               This I will graunt you. But you must graunt me also, that looke what is giuen to him, amongst the Priestes, in matters of the Lord, yt is, in ecclesiastical: the same, amongst the iudges, is giuen to Zebadias in matters of the king, that is in

ciuil causes. For, Iosaphat doth say as well the one, as the other. So that (to come now to the later point of your lame similitude,) if Christians must haue a soueraine Bishop ouer all, because the Iewes had one chiefe Priest
                  ▪ then Christians must haue a soueraine Prince ouer all, because the Iewes had one chiefe iudge. And as all harder causes, at least of religion must be referred to the Pope: so all of ciuill matters must be referred to the Emperour. And as, amongst the Iewes, the Priest and iudge were resident in the place which the Lord had chosen: so the Pope and the Emperour must both abide in Rome. Which

                   Pope Paule the third did feare that Emperour Charles the fifth would haue done. But he sent for the French men to kéepe him out. If Gregorie (that now is Pope) be better minded, and will resigne his ciuill State vnto the Emperour with the Palace of Vaticane, and Castell of Saint Angelo: then may the reason, which you ground vpon the law in Deuteronomie, serue you with greater shew. Howbeit, euen in that case it would rather further the Emperour then the Pope: because it mentioneth the iudge, as one; the Priestes, as many.

               It is not necessary for the gouernment of the common-wealth among Princes, that any one of them be Prince ouer all. But as the king of Iuda was in his owne kingdome: so euery Prince is highest in his own dominion.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Neither it is necessarie for the administration of the Church, amongst Bishops, that any one of them be Bishop ouer all. But as the hie Priest was chiefe ouer the Iewes, so is euery Bishop ouer his owne charge.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, the case of the Church and common-wealth herein are vnlike, and different. Because that common-weales may be vpholden, although they be gouerned not onely by diuerse kings, and ciuill magistrates, but also by diuerse ordinances and lawes. But the Church as it hath one faith, in all Christians: so ought it to haue the same lawes and ordinances of religion in all countries.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               This difference and vnlikenes betwéene the Church and common-wealth, is lesser then you imagine, if it bee marked well. For iustice, and right, in giuing euery one his due, should haue the same place in the common-wealth, which faith and religion claimeth in the Church. Now, as in religion there

are some things of substance, and some of ceremonie: so there are some pointes essentiall in iustice, and some accidentall. The essentiall pointes of iustice are the same in lawes of all common-wealthes. For what is

Wherefore the same faith, and lawes of religion do no more inforce all churches to obey one Bishop, then the same right and ordinances of iustice do require one Prince to rule all common-wealthes. But what soeuer your fansie make you thinke of this point: the place in Deuteronomie adiudging them to death who disobey the Priest, can not helpe your fansie, though it had béene meant of no other Priest, but of the high Priest onely. For Christ, whē he sent his Apostles to preach the Gospell, said vnto them: 
                     Mat. 10.14. 
                  Whosoeuer shall not receaue you, nor heare your wordes, when yee depart out of that house, or that city, shake of the dust of your feete. Truely I say vnto you, it shall be easier for them of the land of Sodome and Gomorrha in the day of iudgement, then for that citie. Which wordes being spoken to all the Apostles, not to Peter onely, and therefore belonging to all their successors, as well as to Peters: doo shew that euery Bishop, hath as great authoritie giuen him by Christ, as the Priest had by that law in Deuteronomie. In so much that 
                     Epist. 40. & 55. & 62. & 65. & 69. 
                  Cyprian doth alleage it often, (by a better reason of proportiō then yours,) to proue the authoritie of Bishops each in seuerall ouer the flockes committed to them.
            
            
               Hart.
               And what if a matter of religion be harder then Bishops each in seuerall be able to decide it? What if they disagree, and will not yéeld one to another? Doth not wisedome shew, that there must be a chiefe iudge to ende the controuersie? to keepe the truth of faith, and peace of the Church, that it be not pestered with heresies and schismes?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The wisedome of God hath committed that chieftie of iudgement (so to call it) not to the soueraine power of one, but to the common care of many. For when there was a controuersie in the Church of Antioche about the obseruation

of the law of Moses, some Iewes teaching contrarie to that which Paule and Barnabas taught: 
                     Act. 15.2. 
                  they ordeined that Paule and Barnabas, and certaine other of them, should go vp to Ierusalem to the Apostles and Elders about that question. And so by their common agreement and decrée, the controuersie was ended, the truth of faith kept, and peace maintained in the Church. After which example,

So did the Apostles and Apostolike men prouide against schismes & heresies. Their wisedome reached not vnto your policie of one chiefe iudge.
            
            
               Hart.
               The profit of Councels and Synods of Bishops is very great, we graunt. For many eyes see more then one. But it wil be greater, if they be all counsellors vnto one gouernor, then if they gouerne eche his owne, and all in common. For reason doth teach vs, that the regiment of one, which wee call a monarchie, is better and worthier then the regiment of many: as the Philosophers shew, who write of Common-weales.

                  Reason, is a notable helpe of mans weakenes, if it be obedient to faith, as a handmaide; not rule it, as a maistresse. And humane artes, wherein the Philosophers haue séene many sparkles of the truth of God by the light of reason, are profitable instruments to set forth the truth, so farre as they haue peace, not warre, with Gods worde.

But because I list not to trifle out the time with idle discourses about pointes of State; as your

                  Tertullian did of olde against heretikes: What hath Athens to do with Ierusalem? the schoole of philosophy with the Church of Christ? The duetie of Christians is to search and weigh in matters of faith, not what reason, but what religion; not what the Philosophers, but what the Prophets, & Apostles; not what mans fansie, but what the Spirit of God doth say. And so the former parts of your maine argument for the Popes supremacie, are too weake to proue it. The last is weaker then they both. For, that there should be one chiefe and highest Pastor of the Church in earth: it hath some reason by philosophie. That Peter was appointed by Christ to be that one: it hath some shew of scripture. But that the Pope succéedeth Peter therein, it

hath no shew of scripture; and (I trow) you will not proue it by philosophie.

                  Eusebius writeth, that Peter, hauing laide the foundation of the Church of Antioche, (where he sate seauen yeares) went to Rome: & (preaching the gospell there fiue and twentie yeares) continued Bishop of that citie. Now, the Pope is Bishop of Rome: that you graunt. Then I conclude thereof, that he succedeth Peter. For Peter continued Bishop of that citie, as it is witnessed by Eusebius.

               I desired that I might heare, Thus saith the Lord: and you told me that I should heare it. In the first parte of your argument, you fell from it, to, Thus saith the Pope. In the next you mended it, with, Thus say Philosophers. Now you proue the last, by, Thus saith Eusebius.

               You ought not to cast off Eusebius so lightly, as though he were of no credit. For he is the best and auncientest historian of all that haue traueled in setting forth the stories of the Church of Christ. And the paines, the diligence, the reading and iudgement, which in his Chronicle he shewed, was great and wonderfull. In so much that

But men may find some thinges which may bee worthily and truely blamed. As, for example, that he writeth, that Sennacherib who besieged Ierusalem, and Salmanassar who tooke Samaria, were one, and the same man.

watered by others, not by Peter. Wherefore, the former braunch of that which Eusebius reporteth touching Peter, that he had sate seuen yeares at Antioche, in the second yeare of Claudius, is flatly contrarie to the scripture. The later is as contrary, that from that yeare forward he did sit at Rome fiue and twentie yeares, that is, all his life time, till he was put to death by Nero. For, (to graunt the vttermost, which may haue any shew of reason,) admitt, that he was cast by Herode into prison, in the first yeare of Claudius; before which he could not; for 
                     Ioseph. antiquit. Iudaicar. l. 19. c. 5.

                     Act. 12.17. 
                  he went into an other place: whether to Rome or to Antioche, or perhaps to neither, ye scripture leaueth it vncertaine; but, by the Chronicle of Eusebius, either to Antioche or to Rome. If he went to Antioche, and there abode some yeares, before he came to Rome: then is the second yeare of Claudius past, and his abode at Rome could not bee fiue and twentie yeares. Now, it is certaine that he went to Antioche at that time or some other. For 
                     Gal. 2.11. the scripture witnesseth that Paule did there reproue him. But if that were some other time, and from his prison in Ierusalem he went straight to Rome: yet neither could he so be fiue and twentie yeares there. For after hée came thither, a time must be found wherein he was at Antioch; and an other time wherin he was at 1. Pet. 5.13. 
                  Babylon; & an other time, wherin he was at 
                     Gal. 2.1. & Act. 15.7. 
                  Ierusalem, at the Councell of the Apostles; and some yeares after that, 
                     Rom. 15.25. Act. 19.21. & 20.22. when Paule wrote to the Romans, 
                  
                     Rom. 16.3. amongst the chiefe, whom he saluted, he named not Peter; and some yeares after that, when Paule 
                  
                     Act. 28. ver. 17. came prisoner to Rome, when he

                   wrote many epistles thence, Peter is not mentioned, nay those thinges are mentioned which would be staines of his Apostleship, if he had béene at Rome. For,

                  at my first answering, no man assisted me, but all forsooke me: I pray God it bee not laid vnto their charge. Of the which reasons, though some are but probable, yet some are sure proofes, that Peters continuance at Rome was not such, as is reported by Eusebius. And this is so manifest, that, to say nothing of

                  it is most cleere (saith he) and surely known by the Actes of the Apostles, and Pauls epistle to the Galatians, that, for nine yeares after Christes death, vntill the second yeare of the raigne of Claudius, Peter neuer went out of Iewry. Wherfore if he came to Rome, at that time, as it is agreed amongst all autours that he did: it followeth of necessitie,

                  that hee did not sit seuen yeares at Antioche before he came thither, but that his sitting at Antioche was some other time. Which thing I haue resolued on, thus, by the testimonie of most auncient writers. He did come to Rome the second yere of Claudius. From which time there are to the time of his death about fiue and twentie yeares. Wherin, although the auncient writers do say that he sate at Rome: yet doth it not folow thereof that he abode still in the citie. For in the fourth yeare after his comming thither, he returned to Ierusalem: and there was present at the Councell ofthe Apostles.

                  Thence he went to Antioche, and there continued seuen yeares; vntil that Nero was Emperour. In the beginning of whose raigne, he came againe to Rome: where hee repaired the Romane church, which was decaying. And after that

This is the confessiō of your owne Onuphrius, made perhaps against the heare (as I may terme it:) but the light of truth and scripture forced him to it. Wherby you may perceiue that when Eusebius wrote, that Peter sate, first, seuen yeares at Antioch, and fiue and twentie at Rome, after: that befell to him, which

Peter wrote this epistle at Rome, which is called Babylon for the resemblance it had to Babylon that great citie in Chaldaea (where the Iewes were captiues) for magnificence, monarchie, resort and confusion of all peoples and tongues, and for that it was, before Christ and long after, the seate of all Ethnike superstition and idolatry, & the sl

But you say that Peter wrote this epistle at Babylon in Chaldaea, though you

neuer read either in scriptures, or other holy or prophane history, that hee was euer in that citie. But sée your shamelesse partialitie. Here, Babylon (say you) is not taken for Rome: because it would folow that Peter was at Rome, and so forth. But in the Apocalypse, where all euill is spoken of Babylon, there you will haue it signifie nothing else but Rome, and the Romane church also, not (as the Fathers interprete it) the temporall state of the heathen Empire there. So do you folow in euery word no other thing, but ye aduantage of your own heresie. Which is most notorious by this, that you hold that Peter was neue

               Here is a gréeuous crime, wherewith you charge our Protestants, of shamelesse partialitie. But whether shew them selues more partiall and vnhonest handlers of Gods word, our Protestants, or your Papistes: you are too partiall (M. Hart) to iudge. There is a iust iudge who will reueale it in that day, before the eies of all men: and in the meane season he doth reueale it dayly, to them whom he maketh wise to trie spirites, & to discerne the truth from errour. As for this particular, wherein we séeme to you most vnhonest and partiall, that in Peters epistle we take the word [Babylon] properly, for the citie of that name in Chaldaea; and in the Reuelation wee say that it signifieth Rome, figuratiuely: we do not this for any aduantage of heresie, as you falsely charge vs, but in sinceritie before God.

Now Rome in these respects was Babylon (as he construeth it) while the heathen Emperours obtained the temporall state there, not since the Popes haue had it.

Marke was Peters scholer at Rome: yet this proueth not, that he meant Rome by the name of Babylon. For Peter saith onely, the Church which is in Babylon, & Marke my sonne salute you. Now Marke (as 
                     Euseb. hist. ecclesiast. l. 3. c. 36. your Papias also doth report) did follow and accompanie Peter in his trauel.

And so the reproch of shamelesse partialitie which you cast on vs, redoundeth on your selues. For if you had any modestie and equitie, you would neuer say, that we denye Rome to be meant by Babylon, because it would follow that Peter was at Rome, and so forth. Specially, sith neyther all of vs deny it: and many who denye it, yet deny not but Peter was at Rome. But whereas you adde, that we deny it, fearing hereby the sequele of Peters or the Popes supremacie at Rome:

               But you can not proue it by those words of Peter, which you would ground it on: although it were graunted that he meant Rome by Babylon. For ye most that might be proued so therby, is, yt he was at Rome. Which furthereth no more the Pope of Rome then of Ioppe. And thus you may sée, what tragedies you make for how small trifles: when you lay so heinous a crime to our charge for denying that, which although we graunt, we neyther winne, nor lose by it.
            
            
               Hart.
               But if he were at Rome, it will be the likelyer that he was Bishop there. And that hee was so, Eusebius sheweth in his Chronicle.

               I perceyue the Pope must fetch his supremacie from earth and not from heauen. You are fallen againe, from scripture, to Eusebius. Against whose autoritie I might take exception, because he saith that Peter continued bishop of Rome, preaching the gospel there, fiue and twentie yeares: which I haue proued to be vntrue. Though, (if I may speake mine owne coniecture of it,) the difference of the Chronicle and historie of Eusebius concerning that point, doth moue mee to thinke, that it was not writen by Eusebius, but by Ierom. For

Now, though the Apostles Peter and Paule did performe that duetie to the Church of Rome, while they abode there: yet because it was the charge of their Apostleship to preach to others also, therefore they went thence to oth

                  r coastes and nations, and left the Romane charge to the Bishop of Rome. And so you may learne by the Fathers thē selues, that when they termed any Apostle a Bishop of this or that citie, as namely, S. Peter of Antioche, or Rome: they meant it in

a generall sort, and signification, because he did attend that Church for a time, and supplyed that roome in preaching of the Gospel, which Bishops did after. But as the name of [Bishop] is commonly taken for the ouerseer of a particular church, and pastor of a seuerall flocke: so Peter was not Bishop of any one citie, and therefore not of Rome.

               They did succeede Peter, as Bishops an Apostle: and they did succéede him in Rome, as other Bishops did in other cities. Wherefore if the Bishop of Rome by this succession haue right to the supremacie: what hath the Bishop of Antioche? For he succeeded Peter too.

               The Bishop of Antioche did succéede Peter, while Peter liued yet, and had not left his right. But the Bishop of Rome succéeded him, when he died: and thereby was aduanced vnto that supremacie, which Peter kept while hee liued.

                  Robert smelled belike, & so he thought it better to say that Peter kept his right, while hee liued: but, when he died, the Bishop of Rome was his successour, and had it (as I trow) by legacie. A pretie shift if it woulde stand: but it lacketh life. For Linus Bishop of Rome, who succéeded Peter, succéeded Peter liuing: in the same maner as did the Bishop of Antioche.

               Not so. But Clemens rather did succéede Peter: and that, after his death. For, when he perceiued his end to draw néere, he tooke Clemens by the hand: and said, in the hearing of the whole Church, (which was then assembled,) Hearken vnto me, my brethren and fellow-seruants. Because (as my Lord & maister Iesus Christ, who sent me, hath told me,) the day of my death approcheth: I ordeine this Clemens to bee your Bishop, vnto whom alone I commit the chaire of my preaching and doctrine; and I giue to him that power of binding and loosing which Christ gaue to me, that whatsoeuer he decreeth of any thing in earth, the same shall bee decreed in

                   his preface to the booke entitled the recognitions of Clemens, which he translated too, some demaund (saith he) how, when as Linus and Cletus were Bishops of Rome before Clemens, himselfe (in his epistle to Iames) saith that the chaire of teaching was committed to him by Peter. Whereof this is the reason, as we haue heard, that Linus and Cletus were in deed Bishops in Rome before Clemens, but while Peter liued: that they might haue the care of the Bishoply charge, & he might do the duety of the Apostleship. As it is found that also he did at Caesarea: where, though being present himselfe, yet he had a Bishop whom he had ordained, namely Zachaeus. And thus may eche of these things be thought to be true: both that they were reckened Bishops, before Clemens; and Clemens neuertheles receiued the chaire of teaching after the death of Peter.

                  Ierom saith, did beare the name of Clemens, and was reproued by olde writers, but be it, what you wil: you confesse your selfe that to be vntrue, for proofe wherof you cited it, that Clemens succeeded Peter, and not Linus. Wherefore, séeing Linus did succéede Peter, & that while Peter liued, in the same sort as Zachaeus did (you say) at Caesarea, & Euodius at Antioche: the Bishops of Antioche, & of Caesarea, may claime as well the Papacy by Peters succession, as may the Bishop of Rome.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Yet by your owne graunt and the consent of histories, Linus who succéeded him in Rome, did out-liue him. And therefore he was the successour of Peter, not onely while Peter was aliue yet, but when he was deceased also.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               He was so. What of that?
            
            
               Hart.
               Of that I conclude the Bishop of Romes supremacy, and conuince you of errour. For Peter had charge of all the Church of Christ. But the Bishop of Rome is the successour of Peter. The Bishop of Rome therefore hath charge of all the Church of Christ.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               As if you should say:

                  Roboam, Salomons sonne, was his successour. Roboam therefore raigned ouer all Israell. Whereby you might conuince the scripture of errour, for saying that 
                     
                        •
                     . King. 12. vers. 20. 
                  Ieroboam was king ouer all Israell, and none did folow Roboam, but the tribe of Iuda onely.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               They reuolted from Roboam. But he had right to be their king, as being heire of Salomon.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But what is that to my reason? For pointes in a similitude are bound to hold no farder, then that, wherein they are resembled. Els you might adde too, that the Pope is liker to Ieroboam then to Roboam, because of his 
                     vers. 28. 
                  golden gods: and therefore should be king rather of all Christendome, then of the prouince of Rome onely. But if your cauill please you against that reason: heare an other. The Apostles of Christ had charge of all nations. All Bishops are successours of the Apostles. Therefore all Bishops haue charge of all nations. Will you reply now that men reuolt from Bishops: but they haue right to be Popes, as being heires of the Apostles?
            
            
               Hart.
               No: For though all Bishops succeede the Apostles,
                  
as S. 
                  
                     Epist. ad Euagr
                   
                  Ierom saith well, & it is true: yet they succede them not in their whole right. They succeede them in the kind of charge, 
                     Marc. 16.15. 
                  to preach the Gospell: but not in the amplenes, to preach it vnto euery creature. They succeede the Apostles, but not in the Apostleship. For of the Apostleship there is no succession, as D. 
                  
                     Princip. doctrinal. l. 6. c. 7.

               Rainoldes.
               Then D. Stapleton sheweth, that the Bishop of Rome doth not succéede Peter in the Apostleship neither.
            
            
               Hart.
               And what if he do not?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then he succéedeth not to all the right of Peter. Then how is the supremacie proued by this succession? Then the Pope vsurpeth, who will be the Apostles successor in the Apostleship. For he calleth his office

                  Chrysostome is witnesse, auouching expressely, that Christ did commit his sheepe to bee fedde both vnto Peter, and to Peters successours. Which to bee likewise meant by those words in the two and twentéeth of Luke, I haue praied for thee that thy faith faile not, and thou being conuerted strengthen thy brethren:

                        s epist. Concil. Tom. 1. Pope Marcus in his decretall epistle to Athanasius, Pope Lucius in his decretal epistle to the demands of French and Spanish Bishops, Pope Felix in his decretall epistle to Benignus, haue manifestly taught.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Nettles amongst roses, when you set the bastard autours of these decretals amongst the auncient Fathers. But tel me in good sooth: thinke you that euerie Pope must denie Christ?
            
            
               Hart.
               Denie Christ? What meane you to aske me that question?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Because you seeme to say, that 
                     Luc. 22. ver. 32. 
                  Christes words to Peter, and thou being conuerted strengthen thy brethren, are meant of all them.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               What? And say I therefore, that they must denie Christ?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Or els you say nothing. For why said Christ to Peter, and thou being conuerted? Did he not say it 
                     ver. 34. in respect that Peter would auert and turne him selfe away from him, when

he denied him thrise?
            
            
               Hart.
               So: what if he did?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then if the same wordes be meant of al Popes, euerie Pope must first be turned away from Christ, that he may be conuerted after: and therfore euerie Pope must deny Christ. If I should say so: some would be angrie with me. But you may say what you list.
            
            
               Hart.
               This is such a reason, as yt, (which hath bene made too,) yt 
                  if the wordes, 
                  
                     Mat. 16. ver. 1

                     ver. 23. 
                  Satan, thou art an offense to me, must concern him also, because they were spoken by Christ to Peter both. But, as 
                     Rob. Bellarm. contr. 4. quaest. 
                     
                        •
                     . Father Robert answereth to that, so doo I to this, that the reason followeth not. For certaine thinges (saith he) are spoken to Peter for himselfe alone; certaine for himselfe, and for al Christians; certaine for himselfe, and for his successors. This is plainely gathered by the diuers reason and consideration, whereon they are spoken to him. For those thinges which are spoken to him as one of the faithfull, are vnderstood to be spoken vnto all the faithfull: as, 
                  
                     Mat. 18.2
                        •
                     , 
                  if thy brother trespasse against thee. Those things which are spoken in some respect of his owne person, are spoken vnto him alone: as, 
                  
                     Luc. 22.34. 
                  thou shalt denie me thrise. Those things which are spoken in regard of his pastorall duetie, are spoken vnto all pastours: as 
                  
                     Ioh. 21.15. 
                  feede my sheepe, and, strengthen thy brethren. And thus you may sée yt the wordes of Christ, I haue praied for thee, that thy faith faile not, and, strenghthen thy brethren, might in such sort be spoken vnto Peter, that they might pertaine to euery Pope also: though the other wordes, to denie Christ, and to be conuerted, do not perteine to them. You will not say your selfe, (I trust) of faithful Christians, that they must all denie Christ. Yet 
                     Chapt. 3. Diuis. 2. you said that this praier & commandement of Christ perteine to them all, if you be remembred.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I remember it well: and it is verie true. But this doth giue a deadly stripe to that argument, which you pretē
                  ded to be made by the Fathers. For if the wordes of Christ, Feede my sheepe, and, strengthen thy brethren, must bee vnderstood as spoken vnto all Pastors, which by your answere you graunt: then how can they proue the supremacie of one Pastor, which you conclude in your argument?
            
            
               
               Hart.
               I did not meane by [all Pastors] the Pastors of all Churches: but all the Pastors of one Church, namely of the Church of Rome.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But Robert, the Father whose wordes you alleaged, doth meane the Pastors of all Churches. And the commandement of Christ, Feede my sheepe, belongeth to them also: vnlesse

                  Chrysostome expresly saith, (as I alleaged,) that Christ did commit the feeding of his sheepe to Peter and to Peters successours.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               And be you certaine, that by [Peters successours] he meant the Bishops of Rome?
            
            
               Hart.
               Whom should he meane but them?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               He meant all Bishops: not all ye Bishops of one Church, but the Bishops of all Churches. Which is euident by his wordes, and the entent whereto he spake them. For to stirre vp Basil, and make him glad and willing to doo the office of a Bishop, which he had vndertaken, he telleth him, that Christ when he saide to Peter, Dost thou loue me? Feede my sheepe, did thereby shew how deere his sheepe are vnto him, and therefore would surely giue great rewarde to Pastors who feede them, and guide them. For why did he shed his owne blood, (saith Chrysostome) but euē to purchase those sheepe, the care of whom he committed to Peter and to Peters successours. Whereupon he goeth forward, and declareth what that charge is, which Christ gaue to Peter and to all Pastors by that commission Feede my sheepe. So that both the course of Chrysostom
                        •
                     
                   spéech, and the drift of his reason, and the person whom it implyeth, S. Basil, Bishop, not of Rome, but of Caesarea, doo manifestly shew, that he meant, by naming [the successours of Peter] all Pastors of the flocke, al Bishops of the Church of Christ. And this is so cléere, that 
                     Rob. Bellarmin. contr. 4. quaest. 3. Father Robert himselfe (in his Romane Lectures) doth not only graunt it, but also proue it by two reasons: one, out of

                  Austin, that Peter was a figure of the Church, that is to say, he represented all Pastours, when Christ said to him, feede my sheepe: an other, out of

For you perswade the simple, and chiefly young scholers who trust your common-place-bookes, that Chrysostome spake of Peter and Peters successours, in the same meaning that the Pope doth, when he Pope Boniface the eighth▪ 
                     c. vna sanctam. extra. de maioritat. & obedientia.

               In déede, to feede the sheepe is common after a sorte to the Pastors of all Churches. But in many Churches the faith of Pastors hath failed. Wherefore Christes prayer for the faith of Peter, that it should not faile, is not common to them all. Onely the Bishops of the Church of Rome haue neuer failed in faith. By the which euent of thinges it is plaine, that Christ made that prayer for Peters successours in the See of Rome: and so did establish them ouer al, in charging them to strengthen
                  
their brethren.

For, if you thinke here, that notwithstanding all these crimes he might be good after, as Peter repēted when he had denyed Christ, and so his faith did not faile, though it did fainte: then I must tell you further, that Pope Iohn went forwarde as he had begoon, and his death was answerable vnto his life.

               What if Pope Iohn, and some others of them, offended in their liues? Yet their faith failed not, that faith which Christ spake off. For by the name of [faith] he meant the doctrine of faith, which he prayed for Peter and so for his successours that they might kéepe sound, and neuer be seduced from it to any heresie. No more was Pope Iohn, nor any other of the Popes: though in their liues they were not all of the best.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I thought that Christ had meant by the name of [faith] a liuely Christian faith: which 
                     Rom. 3.25. imbraceth the promise of the mercie of God; which 
                     Gal. 5.6. 
                  worketh by loue, and bringeth forth the fruites of faith; which 
                     Ioh. 6.47. whosoeuer haue, they haue assurance of euerlasting life. But you thinke belike that he meant a dead faith: a faith, which they haue of whom 
                     Iam. 2.19. it is writen, the Diuels beleeue, and tremble; a faith, which Pope Iohn might haue, and be a reprobate, and dye without repentance, and be the heire of death eternall.
            
            
               Hart.
               I say not that Christ meant a dead faith, but the right faith: that is, as I saide, the true and Catholike doctrine of the faith of Christ. As the scripture vseth that worde, where it is writen, that 1. Tim. 1.1. 
                  in the later times some shall depart from the faith, and shall giue heede to spirites of errour, and doctrines of Diuels. The doctrines of Diuels are heresies whatsoeuer. The faith is the true doctrine set against heresies. S. Pe

                  Thou art Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God. From this faith the diuell would haue remoued him. But Christ prayed for him that it should not faile. And so I say he prayed for the Bishops of Rome, that it should faile in none of them.

For, if he had meant the doctrine, as you construe it, the true and Catholike doctrine of the faith of Christ: how had he armed Peter against those fiery darts of Satā, which a right opinion in matters of faith was not able to quench? Wherin marke, I pray, what blemish you cast on the wisedome of Christ, whom you suppose to haue said to Peter: the Deuill will tempt you to draw you from my loue, and to destroy you body and soule; but I haue prayed for thee, that thou shalt thinke aright in matters of faith. Which is, as if a Captaine, to cheere vp a souldiour (whom he had speciall care off) against

the battaile, should tell him: the enimie will assault you with poisoned shot, to kill you; but I haue got a shield of paper for thee, to defend thee from it. Then which what can be spoken more ridiculous, or absurd?

               As though a right faith were no stronger fense against assaultes of the Deuill, then is a shield of paper against poisoned shot. S. Paule thought not so,

But to be preserued safe from these dartes, is not enough to life: neither doo all of them giue mortall woundes. The dartes, whereof I spake, are more sharpe, & deadly. Whom they wound, they kill. Against the which kind, if Christ had armed Peter with such a faith as you imagine, when Satan desired to sift him as wheat: it is profane to thinke it, but it foloweth of your fansie, that he armed him with (as it were) a paper-shield against poysoned shot. For, as against this shot a shield of paper cannot preserue our temporall life: so a right opinion in matters of faith could not saue him to life eternall from those dartes.

And so is that position found to be false, on which you pitch the Papacie; that Christ made that prayer for Peters successours in the See of Rome,

The Pope doth not succeede him in this priuilege neither. For the Pope may, not onely erre in doctrine, but also be an heretike.

               They graunt that the Pope may be an heretike, perhaps, by a supposall: as many things may be, which neuer were, nor are, nor shall be. For you cannot proue, that euer any Pope was an heretike, actually: though possibly they may be. Wherof I will not striue.

               If they may be possibly, which you must néedes graunt: then is it certaine that it was not meant by the words of Christ that they should not faile in doctrine of faith. For whatsoeuer he saith, that it shall not be: that cannot be possibly. But it it is no surer that they may be heretikes: then it is manifest, that some of them haue béene. For whē the Church was pestered with the heresie of the Monothelites, who, (whereas Christ is made our Sauiour and redéemer by that he doth consist of 1. Tim. 3.1

               Whether Pope Honorius held that heresie or no: the Catholikes are of diuers iudgements; some thinking that he did, some that he did not. Father Robert, the reader of controuersies in Rome, preferreth the opinion of

               They shew by good reasons that he is falsely slaundered. For Pighius and Hosius doo bring the testimonies of historians, Platina, Sabellicus, Nauclerus, Blondus, & Aeneas Siluius: who say, that Honorius did condemne the heresie of the Monothelites. Whereto Onuphrius addeth the authorities of Emmanuell Callêca, a Grecian; and Iohn of Turrecremata, Cardinal of San-sisto: who haue proued by their writings that he was a Catholike Bishop.

               But there are also in the Popes librarie the writings of Maximus, who liued about the same time. And it is plaine by him that Honorius did not subscribe to that heresie: yea, that of a certainetie he did condemne it.

                  Onuphrius might say so, and (as he thought) safely, because it was not likely, that we should see Maximus in ye Popes librarie to disproue his saying. But it is disproued by your owne

And Maximus (as it is well noted by Torrensis a singular

learned man, hauing purposly vndertaken to cleere Honorius of that heresie, made not any mention of his condemning it: though, if it had beene so, he must haue knowne it needes, and could not haue omitted it. Now, this

                  Torrensis, whom Andradius prayseth, hath alleaged that whole place of Maximus touching Honorius: whereof the summe is this, that the secretarie of Honorius, who wrote the verie epistle that he was charged by, and knewe belike his meaning best, expounded part thereof in a good sense, that it might seeme sounde. And this is that Maximus

                  plaine, (or at the least would haue vs take it,) that Honorius did neuer subscribe to that heresie, yea, that of a certaintie he did condemne it. But sée what difference betwéene men. Andradius, who alloweth the secretaries exposition which Maximus alleaged to cléere Honorius of that heresie, yet thinketh it plaine by that place of Maximus, that hee did not condemne it. Torrensis, a friend of the Popes too, declareth, that a part of the epistle of Honorius is helped reasonably by the secretaries exposition: but it fitteth not another parte thereof, in which it is plaine by his owne wordes, that he was a Monothelite. So Torrensis who had accesse to the Popes library as well as Onuphrius, hath shewed that Onuphrius did meane to steale a lye by sending vs to Maximus in the Popes library. As for Maximus himselfe, he was loth, for good will both to Honorius and the truth, that the heretikes should boast (as

Constantinop. act. 11. the generall Councell (before which hée wrote) found after, on better examination of the matter, that Honorius ioyned with them, and taught as they did. Wherefore, whatsoeuer Maximus hath writen or rather wished of it: the Councell is of greater credit then Maximus; much more, then Callêca or Turrecremata, who could not say therein so much as Maximus,

               That which you alleage of the Councell, were somewhat, if they had condemned Honorius of that heresie. But they did not: although it be so writen in the Councell now. For Anastasius, the kéeper of the Popes library, who liued within two hundred yeares after Honorius, doth teach in his Latin

                  Onuphrius saith as I saide. And that which he saith, he saith that Sirletus, then, a chiefe Notarie, now Cardinall of Rome, an excellent learned man, had marked it.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               A foule and grosse faute, either of Sirletus, or Onuphrius, or both. For there were two méetinges of Bishops at Constantinople, which both doo beare the name of the sixth Councell: 
                     Sexta Synodus Constantinop.
                   the former, vnder the Emperour Constantine the fourth, about the yeare of Christ sixe hundred and eightie; 
                     Canones patrum Constantinop. in Trullo.
                   the later, vnder his sonne Iustinian, towarde a thirtie yeares after. The former was assembled against the heresie of the Monothelites: the Bishops of the west Church, as well as of the east were present, and they with one consent did al condemne Honorius. In the later there met the Bishops of the east onely, who made rules and orders of ecclesiasticall discipline, which are the Canons that you mention. These Canons doo conteine the summe of the ordinances of the Gréeke Church: wherein the Church of Rome is grated vpon, both for 
                     can. 3. & 13. & 55. & 69. other pointes, and chiefly for 
                     can. 36. & 39. the Popes supremacie. The Gréeke Bishops therefore to winne the more credit vnto their Canons, said that they were made by the sixth generall Councell. Of which

But Theophanes, and Anastasius haue shewed that to be a tale, as it is in déede: and in discourse thereof haue saide of those Canons, that they are falsly named the Canons of the sixth Councell. Now Sirletus, falling belike on these wordes, and remembring that the sixth Councell is saide to haue condemned Honorius: thought it either true, or wholesome to be taught as true, that hee was condemned by harlotrie Canons not made by the Councell, but forged in the Councels name. Which fansie peraduenture he

told his friend Onuphrius: and Onuphrius for ioy went and set it in print. So, by the conueiance of Onuphrius and Sirletus, pretending and abusing the countenance and names of Anastasius, and Theophanes: the sixth generall Councell is put to silence (as it were,) from bearing witnesse against Honorius. But, the mischiefe of it is, that

                  Torrensis againe doth marre the play. For out of the histories of Theophanes and Anastasius (which are not common to be séene) he hath alleaged also this place touching those Canons. Whereby it is manifest that their meaning was not to discredit the actions of the sixth Councell which condemned Honorius in the time of Constantine, as you would haue vs to imagin. Their meaning was onely to shew that the Canons, which are called the Canons of the sixth Councell, were made by other Bishops in the time of Iustinian, long after that Councell, and therefore are falsly fathered vpon that.

In the first action, the eight, and the eleuenth: the heretikes alleage in their owne defense, that Pope Honorius taught as they doo. In the twelfth, and thirtenth, his writinges are examined, his heresie discouered, himselfe condemned,

and cursed. In the sixtenth, seuententh, and eightenth, the sentence which was giuen against him, and

                  Harding, who would not graunt so much of any other Pope, yet graunted of Honorius, that he may be iustly burdened with heresie, and fell in deede into it. But now, behold, a newe gamster, a Iesuit, Father Robert, doth set vpon the matter fresh, and teacheth in his solemne

lectures at Rome, that 
                     Opinio vera est, posse esse haereticum.

                  it is probable, and godly to be thought, that he cannot be an heretike. A straunge resolution, and fitte for a Iesuit. Yet to shew how probable he can make that seeme which he confesseth to be false, by holding the contrarie therof to be true: he saith somewhat for euery one of those Popes that are charged with heresie; and for Pope Honorius he dealeth more impudently then Pighius himselfe. For he toucheth not the credit of the sixth, or seuenth Councell, onely; but all that come in his way: Councels, Popes, Gr

                     ekes, Latins, Historians, Diuines, either they are corrupted, or abused by corruption. Well may the opinion, which Father Robert saith for, be probable & false both. But this of Honorius, by which he would confirme it, is (out of all doubt) though false, yet not probable.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               It is probable enough, as Father Robert handleth it. For streames may be corrupted as easily as the fountaine, or take infection at least from the fountaine being corrupted. Now the fountaine as it were, whence the rest haue drawne it, is the sixth Councell. And he saith, that there the name of Honorius was thrust in amongst the names of other heretikes, by malitious men, of spite against the Pope. Whereof hee bringeth two proofes. One, that Anastasius witnesseth it to haue bene so, out of Theophanes. An other, that the Gréekes aduentured sometimes to corrupt bookes: as

               Rainoldes.
               The Councell declareth that there were some copies of a former Councell, that had bene corrupted by heretikes among the Greekes. But, as euill dealing doth still leaue steppes behind it, whereby it may be traced out, 
                     Act. 3. & 14. their corruption was discouered both by circumstances of the thing, and by the maner of writing, and by conference with other copies. Now in these places of the sixth Councell in which Honorius is touched: you can shew no token of any such suspicion. Nay, the tokens all are cleere to the contrarie: euen yt which you alleage of the Greekes conuicted to haue corrupted bookes. For if they had corrupted so much of the Councell in so many places: it is very likely that they would haue also corrupted those places, wherein they are noted and discredited for such corruptions. Neither doth Anastasius report out of Theophanes, that the Greekes did so. Perhaps

Father Robert did dreame out of Onuphrius, that hee had said so. But, although Onuphrius say more in that point then truth did afford: yet he saith not that. As for Anastasius: he is so farre from saying it, that he gainesayeth it rather. For,

Wherfore if the epistles of Honorius were sound, on which, as vnsound, he was condemned of heresie: then a generall Councell confirmed by the Pope did erre in condemning him. And if you graunt this, as you must by consequent: you betraye the strongest castell of Poperie, to saue a captaines honour. For men of iudgement will thinke, that the doctrine of the reformed Churches may be sound, for which as vnsound the Councell of Trent confirmed by the Pope hath condemned vs. They might condemne vs vniustly.
            
            
               Hart.
               Not so. For they examined and knew very perfitly the doctrine of the reformed Churches, as you call them.

               Yet were this also a blemish of the Councell, to condemne a Pope in steede of an heretike. But they haue not deserued to be touched with it. For, the

The fansie of Pighius is, that the Councell did not condemne Honorius: the copies of it are corrupted.

The Pope cannot erre: therefore Pope Honorius was not an heretike. Honorius was not an heretike: therefore the sixth generall Councell did not condemne him. For the conclusion hereof, being false, doth argue a falshood in that which doth inferre it. That is the first proposition: which you must amend, and reason thus of the contrarie. The sixth generall Councell did condemne Honorius: therefore he was an heretike. Pope Honorius was an heretike: therefore the Pope may erre. The Pope may erre: Christ therefore prayed not for the Pope, in that he prayed for Peter. For had he prayed for the Pope, then the faith of Pope Honorius had not failed. But his faith failed. Christ therefore prayed
                  
not for him.

                  You shall not teache mee how to reason. The firste proposition of Pighius is good, though it be admitted that his conclusion is fawtie. For the learned Catholikes, albeit they graunt that Honorius was an heretike and condemned iustly by the sixth generall Councell: yet they hold that Christ prayed for the Pope, and that therefore the Pope cannot erre; but how? Christ did not respect S. Peters person, but his office, when hée prayed for him that his faith should not faile: for it was to this end, that he being conuerted might strengthen and confirme his brethren. Now, because the Church, for whose sake that priuilege was giuen vnto Peter, should néede to be strengthned afterwarde no lesse then in his time: therefore was it giuen to him, not as to him alone for himselfe, but as for his successours in the Church of Rome too. So, the Pope is priuileged from falling into errour by the prerogatiue of his office, through the ordinance of Christ: that would haue all Bishops and Pastors of the world to depend on him for their confirmation in faith and ecclesiasticall regiment. Whereof it ensueth that he cannot erre in respect of his office, although in respect of his person he may: or (to speake it after the phrase of the

                   he saide, that Innocentius had said it, not as Pope, but as Frier Peter of Tarantasia (that was his name, as a priuate man) in one of his postils. And this was well saide of Iohn. For when Innocentius was Pope, he had no leasure (I trow) to write postils: it is likely that he wrote them before he was Pope, when he was Frier Peter of Tarantasia. But as that distinction of [Pope] and [priuate man] is vsed by your doctors in the case of Honorius: so I saide and say againe, it is a quirke, a vaine quirke and fansie. For that, which Honorius wrote, and was condemned for, he wrote it as Pope, not as a priuate man.
            
            
               Hart.
               You meane, that he wrote it when he was Pope: that is true. But he wrote it not as Pope.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I meane, that he wrote it as Pope: and I will proue it if you will giue me leaue. But first to take vp that which you haue laide to disproue it: you alleage that Caiphas was exempt from errour, nay prophecied right of Christ, by priuilege of his office. Whereby you would imply the like touching

the Pope. The example agréeth verie fitly in part. But doth it agrée (thinke you) in that part, in which it must to serue your turne?
            
            
               Hart.
               What els? For it is writen in the holy gospell, that when the Iewes consulted in a Councel what to doo with Christ, whether to let let him alone, or apprehend him: 
                     Ioh. 11.44. 
                  Caiphas, being the high Priest of that yeare, saide to them, you know nothing, neither do you consider, that it is expedient for vs, that one man dye for the people, and the whole nation perish not. And this he saide not of himselfe: but being the hie priest of that yeare, he prophecied that Iesus should die for the nation.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But it is writen also in the holy Gospell, that in an other Councell and consultation of the Iewes, wherein they sought vniustly to condemne the iust, when Iesus being asked whether he were Christ, the sonne of God, confessed him selfe to be so: Caiphas, 
                  
                     Matt. 26.65. 
                  the hye priest, saide, hee hath blasphemed: what neede we witnesses any further? behold, now you haue heard his blasphemie. Was this spéeche of Caiphas, a prophecie, or an errour?
            
            
               Hart.
               What if it were an errour?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               How sée you not then that Caiphas did not prophecie by priuilege of his office? For so he should haue prophecied in this Councell too, in which he sate as hye Priest, hée spake as hye Priest, and to him as hye Priest the Councell did assent in giuing sentence against Christ. But that amongst many mischiefes and falshoodes he spake the wordes of truth once, in a sense, not which he meant, (for he meant wickedly) but which his spéeche yéelded: there was a worke of God in it.

                  he opened the mouth of the asse of Balaam, to reproue her maister. And you, who would gather an ordinarie priuilege of the Popes office by that extraordinarie prophecying of Caiphas: doo make a like reason, as if you should conclude that ye Popes horse can speake, because that Balaams asse did. Nay, you might conclude this on greater reason. For Balaams asse spake twise: Caiphas prophecied but once.

                  In that day the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the Princes and the Priestes shal be astonished. And Ezekiel, more plainely:

                  The law shall perish from the Priest, & counsell from the Elders. But, till that time they had it, and did teach the truth according to the law, and were to be obeied in all things which they taught.

               Yea? What say you then of Vrias, who was hie Priest vnder king Achaz, sixe hundred yeares before Christ? He ceased to sacrifice on the altar of God, appointed by the law: and,

                  2. King. 16.16. hauing made a new one like to the altar of Damascus, he sacrificed vpon it. Whereby he defiled himselfe and the land with rebellion against the Lord.
            
            
               Hart.
               I say that Vrias did erre in doing so. But we may refute this reason of yours by denying that Vrias did succede Aaron, and was of the tribe of Leui.

                     Hosius contr. Brent. lib. 2. a Cardinall answereth that you may refute it so in one word. And that is shewed plainelye enough (as he saith) by those wordes of scripture which are writen of Ieroboam;

For, the Priestes, which Ieroboam made of the lowest of the people not of the sonnes of Leui, were in the kingdome of Israel, at Bethel and Dan: and Vrias was Priest in the temple at Ierusalem, in the kingdome of Iuda.

               Let it be admitted that he was so. The staine of his fault is not so foule as you make it. For what did he els, but that which we reade Pope Marcellinꝰ to haue done? Who, in the horrible persecution of Christians vnder Maximian and Diocletian, took incense for feare, and offered it to Idols. Vrias did transgresse the law of God, not wilfully, but through the frailtie of the flesh: not of his own accord, but by the kings commaundement. Wherfore it came rather of feare, then of rashnes or ignorance, that hee offended.

               So did it 
                     Mat. 26.70. in Peter, that he denied Christ. And may you therefore say, that Peter was priuileged not to denie Christ? I maruell that you feele not the grossenes of your dealing. You say that hie Priestes are priuileged by their office to perseuere in true doctrine. It is shewed, that they fall to manifest Idolatrie. You graunt they do so: but they do it for feare, you say. Where is the priuilege then? For God, to whom so euer he giueth any benefit as it were by priuilege: hee giueth them a priuilege withall of speciall fauour to frée them from the lettes that

might debarre them of the benefit. 2. King.

Wherefore if God had giuen a priuilege of true doctrine to the hie Priestes, hee woulde haue giuen them a priuilege of grace too, that no deceit of fleshe should make them fall away from it. But they might fall away from it by sundry meanes, to errour, yea to Idolatrie. For if they might for feare, why not for loue also, 1. King. 1

                   as Salomon did? If for loue: why not for hope? If for hope: why not for hatred? If for any of these, why not for other causes? It remaineth therefore, that either the hie Priestes had not that priuilege: or, if they had it, they had it with exception, that they should not erre, vnlesse either feare, or other cause did moue them to it. Which if you affirme of Popes in like sort, as you séeme to doo by the example of Marcellinus: I will agree with you. For I am perswaded that no Pope can erre, vnlesse he be moued thereto by some cause, either blindnes of mind, or lewdnes of heart, or such humane affections.

                  Nothing in the earth is done without a cause, saith your olde translation. Howbeit, for Vrias, perhaps you do him iniurie to say that he offended as Marcellinus did, of feare. For it appeereth not by circumstances of ye text, but yt he was as willing to transgresse the law, as was the king to bid him. 2. King. 16. ver. 10. 
                  When king Achaz saw the altar that was at Damascus, he sent to Vrias the Priest the paterne of the altar and the facion of it, and all the workemanship thereof. And Vrias the Priest made an altar, in all pointes according as king Achaz had sent from Damascus: so did Vrias the Priest against king Achaz came from Damascus. What a readie minde was here in the Priest, who stayed not to speake with the king at his returne, to disswade him from it: but made the heathnish altar, against hee came frō Damascus? 
                  
                     
                        〈1 paragraph〉
                     
                   
                  And king Achaz commanded Vrias the Priest, saying, vpon this great altar, set on fire the morning burnt-offring and euening meat-offring, and the kings burnt offring and his meat-offring, with the burnt-offring of all the people of the land, and their meat-offring, and their drinke-offrings:

and sprinckle vpon it all the blood of the burnt-offring, and al the blood of the sacrifice. As for the brazen altar, it shall be for me to enquire. And Vrias did according to all that king Achaz had commaunded. Behold, as Moses was faithfull in all the house of the Lord: so was Vrias the Priest in all that Achaz did commaund. Such a Prince, such a Priest.

               Great was the priuilege of the hie Priesthood, and chaire of Moses, in the olde law. Yet nothing like the Churches & Peters prerogatiue. Wherefore howsoeuer Vrias did offend: The Pope cannot fall away from the faith. For

               Rainoldes.
               But in the meane season he did commit idolatrie by your own confession. So that, this example must force you to yeelde that the Pope may erre, though not abide in errour.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay rather, that hee cannot teach errour, though hée may erre. As Pope Marcellinus, though he did commit, he did not teach idolatrie.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Yes, he did teach it, by committing it. For, to teach, is to deliuer the thinges that one knoweth, to him, who knoweth them not. The which that wee may receiue, that is, learne, God hath giuen vs two senses: the hearing, and the sight. Wee heare wordes: we sée déedes. The ministers of Christ, whom he hath ordeined to teach the wisedome of his Father, the way to life eternall, ought to teach by both: that men maye be edified by their wordes, which they heare; and by their déedes, which they sée. Therefore S. Paule requireth in 
                     Tim. 4.12. 
                  Timothee, in 
                     Tit. 2.7. 
                  Titus, and in 1. Tim. 3.2. Tit. 1.7. all Bishops, that both their life be good, and their doctrine sound. And him selfe had ranns this race so before them, that, when he exhorted the Philippians to do whatsoeuer things are true, honest, iust, pure, worthy loue, and of good report: hee was able to say, that by his preaching and liuing they had learned them; 
                     Phil. 4.9· 
                  which thinges you haue heard and you haue seene in me. Yea, it is so forcible to teach by liuing well: y•

                  Chrysostom (commending S. Paul in yt point) preferreth it before the other. It is very easie (saith he) to teach by wordes. Teach me by thy life. This is the best teaching. For wordes

doo not so sticke vnto the minde, as workes. And if thy worke be not good, thou shalt not onely not profit, but also hurt more by speaking, and it were better to hold thy peace. Why? Because thou shewest me the worke so, as if it could not be done. For I thinke with my selfe, if thou who speakest so great things, doost them not: much more am I to be excused, who speake no such thing. Therefore saith the Prophet, 
                  
                     Psal. 50.16. 
                  vnto the wicked man saith God, why takest thou vpon thee to declare my ordinances? For this is greater harme, when a man teacheth well in wordes, and fighteth against it with his workes. Thus you may sée that Bishops doo teach by their life, not by their preaching onely. Wherefore, though Marcellinus the Pope did not teach idolatrie by worde: yet by his fact he did. And so your answere falleth that he did commit, but not teach idolatrie.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               I graunt that he did teach it after a sort:
                     The fourth diuision.
                   but not as I meant. I meant he taught it not by preaching. In that he could not erre. For as I saide before, that the Pope in respect of his person may erre, not in respect of his office: so I say farther, that his office priuilegeth him in his sayings, not in his doings. 
                     Matt. 23.2. 
                  The Scribes and the Pharises (saith our Sauiour Christ) doo sit vpon the chaire of Moses. All thinges therefore, whatsoeuer they shall say vnto you, obserue ye, and doo ye. But according to their workes doo ye not. For they say and do not.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               What? will you also make odious comparisons of Popes to Scribes and Pharises?
            
            
               Hart.
               O, I touch you now: and therefore you would interrupt me. In déede that sentence of Christ doth confound you: no maruell you are loth to heare it. For were the Popes neuer so euill, euen monsters, as 
                     Do vitis Pont.. in Benedicto. quart, & Christophor. prim.
                   
                  Platina doth call some few of them, and they might be so for their liues: yet they were not worse then the Scribes and Pharises.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Beléeue me, but they were. Beware of Pope Iohn. All the Scribes and Pharises might cast their cappes at him. He was a péerlesse monster.
            
            
               Hart.
               You are euer interrupting, to put me from my argument.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I cannot abide, that you should detract from the

Popes. Nay, yet giue them their due. It is a fault (they say) to belye the diuell.

                  Austin, Christ, when he saide of the Scribes and Pharises, They sit vpon the chaire of Moses, meant not them alone, as though he sent Christians to the schoole of the Iewes to learne religion there: but by the name of Scribes and Pharises he signified, that certaine in his Church would say and not doo; and by the person of Moses he signified him selfe, for Moses was a figure of him. In like sort S. 
                  
                     In Iohannem homil. 85.

                  Origen expound it too. He chargeth vs therefore, to heare wicked preachers, professing God with their wordes, but denying him in their déedes: All thinges (saith he) whatsoeuer they shall say vnto you, obserue ye and doo ye. Now the cause and reason thereof is giuen in this, because they sit vpon the chaire, 
                  As D. Stapleton expoundeth it, Quia super cathe

                        am sedent: quia locú Christi tenent.
                   because they hold the roome of Christ, as Scribes and Pharises did of Moses. For so doth our Sauiour reason as it were: They sit vpon the chaire; therefore, that which they say must be obserued, and done.

                  S. Austin handling these wordes hath excellently noted it. Christ (saith he) hath made his people secure concerning wicked Prelates, that men should not for their sakes forsake the chaire of wholesome doctrine, in which euen they who be wicked, are constrained to speake good thinges. And why are they constrained? For (saith he) they be not their owne thinges, but the thinges of God, which they speake. And how may this be? Because (saith he) in the chaire of vnitie, God hath set the doctrine of truth. And by what wordes hath he set it? or where? He addeth: Therefore of Prelates, who doo their owne euill thinges and speake the good thinges of God, he saith in the gospell, Doo that they say, but doo not that they doo, for they say and doo not. Thus saith Austin. In the same sense are these wordes expounded both by 
                     Epist. 137. De verbis Domin. serm. 49. Tractat. in Ioh. 46. lib. de pastorib. cap. 10.

                  Origen: whose wordes I passe ouer for breuities sake. Wherefore to conclude, in despite of heretikes, a sure vndouted certaintie of doctrine and faith is no lesse knit to the chaire of Christ, then to the chaire of Moses,

                     Heb. 8.6.

                   we obserue pointes of faith: we doo precepts of maners. In them both we must be obedient euen to Pharises, that is, to wicked men and hypocrites, sitting in the chaire, that is,

                   because they teach not other thinges but such as are to be obserued. And in this respect doth Christ allow of them. For so the Pharises also them selues, though they were wicked men and hypocrites, yet (as 
                     In Matthaeum homil. 73. 
                  Chrysostom noteth) they did not preach their owne things, but those thinges which God had commanded by Moses. And therefore sith Christ could not commend them for their maners, he doth it for his chaire & doctrine. Wherefore 
                     Qui cathedram tenet Apostolicam.
                   he that sittteth in the chaire of the Apostles, doth speake not of himselfe, but of the chaire; that is, not his owne thinges, but the thinges of God: and therefore must be heard whether he say and doo both, or onely say, and not doo. Hence it is, that

                  they are successours of the Apostles: which hath a greater prerogatiue. The Popes must be therefore obeyed much more in all thinges which they say. But men might not obey them, if they should erre. Therefore they cannot erre in any thing they say. Was not this the verie bodie of your argument?

               None, but (as I saide) that all the limmes of it are full of sores and blisters. For the first proposition (the contagion whereof infecteth the whole argument) hath two notorious fautes touching the Scribes and Pharises: one, that by their sitting in the chaire of Moses, is meant that they succeeded Aaron: an other, that, because they succeeded Aaron, they were to be obeyed in all thinges which they saide.

               None succéeded Aaron, in offering sacrifices to God, and teaching Israell his law, sauing 
                     Deut. 33.10. the tribe of Leui. But the Pharises might be of other tribes: and were so.

Wherefore sith the Pharises were so well estéemed, & did swarme in Iurie: it is not to be thought, but that other tribes had some of that profession, chiefely the tribe of Iuda.

               If Iuda, if Beniamin, if other tribes had of them: much more by all likelihood had the tribe of Leui. And them might our Sauiour specially meane, not generally all, in saying, The Pharises doo sit vpon the chaire of Moses. As, if I should say that the Catholikes sit vpon the chaire of Christ: you must not thinke I meane of Catholikes who be scholers, but of Catholikes who be teachers; of Catholike Priestes, and Bishops.

               According to the word and meaning of Christ. The Scribes and the Pharises sit in the chaire of Moses: that is, they teach the law of Moses. For as 
                     Deut. 5.31. & 6.1. 
                  Moses him selfe receiued it of God to teach it the children of Israel, and he did so: in like sort 
                     Nehem. 8.8. the Priestes and Leuites after him were vsed to reade it in the assemblies of the people, and to expound it. To this end their synagogues were built in euery citie, and euerie Sabbat day they met there, as it is written, 
                     Act. 15.21. 
                  Moses of olde time hath in euerie citie them that preach him being read in the Synagogues euerie Sabbat day. Now they, who did teach, were wont to teach sitting: which appeereth by our Sauiours example 
                     Mat. 26.25. Ioh. 8.2. in the temple, 
                     Luc. 4.20. in the synagogues, 
                     Mat. 5.1. Luc. 5.3. in other places. Wherfore the Scribes and Pharises (of whom there were some 
                     Luc. 5.17. 
                  in euerie towne of Galile, and Iurie, and Ierusalem, to discharge this duetie) are said to haue

                  sate in the seat of Moses (or chaire, as we terme it) because they did teach the same which Moses did, euen the law of God deliuered to Moses.

               Yes. For it foloweth of your exposition that the Scribes and Pharises said well in all things which they said, because they did succeede Aaron: and so, that

                  succession (which is the marke you shoote at) hath certaintie of doctrine and faith knit vnto it. Whereas the right lesson, which you should gather thence, is, that the Scribes and Pharises said well in all thinges

                  we are willed to heare God speaking by them, when we are willed to do the things which they say. For in sitting on Moses chaire, they teach the law of God▪ therefore by them God doth teach. But if they would teach their owne things, (saith Austin) heare them not, obey them not. So doth 
                     In Matthaeum hom. 73. 
                  Chrysostome expound it, Doo all things which the Scribes and Pharises say you must doo: for they preach not their owne things, but the things which God commaunded by Moses. So doth 
                     In Ezekiel. hom. 7. 
                  Origen apply it to them who teach the faith aright: with a speciall clause, that Christians, if they see a preacher liue ill, and haue not to charge him with teaching ill doctrine; they must frame their liues according to his words not deedes. If they haue not to charge him with teaching ill doctrine: as if he should say, that who soeuer teach ill doctrine, they sit not in the chaire of Moses. Let them succéede Aaron neuer so directly▪ yet if their doctrine be ill, they sit not in the chaire of Moses. Whereby you may sée the wretched state of yt argument of which you made so great vaunt. For the first proposition, that the Scribes and Pharises were to be obeied in all thinges which they said, because they sate in the chaire of Moses, that is, they did succeede Aaron: is fouly corrupted in the point of succession. The second, that the Popes do sit in Christes chaire, that is, they are successors of the Apostles: is tainted with the same
                     •
                  canker that the first. The conclusion therefore, that men must obey the Popes in all thinges which they say; and the consequent thereof, that they cannot erre in any thing they say: are children like their parents, as sound as the propositions of which they are begotten. The filthines of all the which if yet you sée not▪ behold an other light to sée it by. The Scribes, amongst the Iewes, were as the Canonists are with you; the Pharises, as the Schoolemen: your

Which point (vnlesse your former argument were naught) will proue that

                  Priestes cannot erre no more then Popes. For they, who sit in Christes chaire, haue greater prerogatiue then they who sate in the chaire of Moses: Priestes, then Scribes and Pharises. The Scribes and the Pharises were to be obeied in all things which they said. The Priestes must bee therefore much more obeied in all things. But if they should erre, then ought they not to be obeied. Therefore they cannot erre in any thing they say. Acknowledge you the forme of your owne argument? Doth not the conclusion folow as necessarily here, as there? And thinke you (M. Hart) that Priestes cannot erre? Thinke you that your selfe are of this perfection? that wée ought to obey, both you, and your companions, in all thinges which you say? Or if you thinke not so fondly of them, so proudly of your selfe, as (I hope) you do not: then leaue Doctor Stapletons exposition, which inferreth it; which he patcheth vp with the wordes of Austin, Chrysostome, and Origen, whereas not one of them meant it. Yéelde rather (if you be wedded to Doctors of your owne side) vnto their authoritie, then whom ye Church of Rome hath none of greater knowledge and perfiter iudgement for right interpreting of ye scriptures: I meane, Iohn Ferus, & Arias Montanus. Of whom

                  charged them to preach the gospell. Whereby it appeereth that the Apostles must be heard, but so farre forth as they be Apostles, that is, as they doo Christes worke, and preach and teach the thinges which Christ commanded. But if they teach other thinges and contrarie to Christ: then are they not Apostles now, but seducers, and therefore not to be heard. O the great light of truth: which forceth euen the aduersaries not onely to perceiue it, but also to reueale it often. So will it force you too: if you haue so much grace as Ferus and Montanus had.

               So much grace, as to say, that if the Apostles teach thinges contrarie to Christ, they are no Apostles now, but seducers. Doo you allow that spéech of Ferus? And might the Apostles be seducers?

                  Peter, an Apostle, might say vnto Christ, (when he heard him speake of suffering at Ierusalem,)

               But Christ did giue them afterwarde 
                     Act. 2.4.

               But Christ had told them before, that

                  it should be easier for Sodom and Gomorrha, then for the citie that shold not heare their wordes. Yet Christ himselfe refused to heare the wordes of Peter. Wherefore the exposition of Ferus is good, that Christ meant those wordes, which he had willed them to preach, that is, the gospell. Beside that, Ferus speaketh not onely of Apostles, but also of their successours. Now though the Apostles were priuileged afterwarde by the speciall graces of the holy ghost to teach the truth in all thinges: yet Bishops, who succeeded them, haue not that priuilege. You must renounce therfore that erroneous expositiō which knitteth an assured truth of faith and doctrine

               I cannot conceiue, but that he meant to cléere their doctrine from errour.

               His wordes belong properly to the instruction of hearers: that they despise not the doctrine of God for the fautes of teachers.

               No sir. For I graunt that Rabbi Selomoh speaketh foolishly. Which is plaine by the place it selfe whereon he gloseth. For the scripture saith there: thou shalt doo all that they shall teach thee; according to the law, or to

                  his law, as we reade it. Wherefore to doo all that the Priestes taught, is not meant of thinges vngodlie or false, but onely true and consonant to the law of God.

               Euen so the scripture sarth here: The Scribes

and the Pharises doo sit in the chaire of Moses; all thinges therefore whatsoeuer they say you must obserue, obserue ye and doo ye. Wherein the word [therefore] restraineth all thinges to that which they teach in the chaire of Moses: that is, (as I haue shewed,) out of the law of God. So that (by your leaue) the dreame of the Iewes is as wise as yours, in this point of all. And as you say to vs, so may they to you: he that saith all thinges, doth except nothing. You except many.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, I except nothing of all which the Scribes and the Pharises teach. For Christ (as I saide) requireth all those thinges to be obserued which they teach: because 
                     Non alia docent quám quae seruanda sunt.
                   they teach not other thinges but such as are to be obserued.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But if they taught any thing against the law of God: I trust you will except that, and graunt that all was not to be obserued which they taught.
            
            
               Hart.
               If they taught any thing against the law: I graunt. But I deny that they taught any thing against it: yea, or could teach.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               And why doo you deny it?
            
            
               Hart.
               Because Christ saith of them, they sit vpō the chaire of Moses. Whereby (to take your owne exposition,) he meant, they teach as Moses did. Now, if they taught as Moses: then taught they not against the law; neither could they. For if they could teach against the law of God: then might that bee false which was meant by Christ, that they teach as Moses.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               That reason holdeth not. For many speake the truth, who can lye, if néede be: and many speake the truth in some thinges, who in all thinges doo not. Christ respecteth that which the Scribes and Pharises did ordinarily: they read the law in the Synagogues; they willed the people to obserue it; yea, in outward thinges, as ceremonies, tithes, purifyings, and sabbats, they did exact it most straitly. But as Paul said vnto the hye Priest, 
                     Act. 23.3. 
                  thou sittest to iudge me according to the law, and doost thou command me to be smitten against the law? so did they some times teach against the law, when they should teach according to it. And hereof is proofe made by Christ him selfe: who therefore willed his disciples to beware of 
                  
                     Mat. 16. vers. 6. 
                  the leauen, that is,

               True: but cleane beside it, vpon a stoole of their owne. For Moses 
                  
                     Ioh. 5.46. 
                  wrote of Christ, and 
                     Rom. 10.4. 
                  Christ is the end of his law. But 
                     Ioh. 7.48. & 8.13. & 9.22. & 12.42. they refused Christ, and taught the people so to doo.

                     Luc. 23.2. They saide that they had found him a man peruerting the nation, forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar. They sclaunderously accused the iust: they did blaspheme the God of glory: they put to death the Lord of life. 
                  
                     Matt. 23.13. They neither entred them selues into the kingdome of heauen, nor suffered others to enter in.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               I graunt that in the person of Christ they did erre: but they did not erre in expounding the law. For when they were demaunded where Christ should bee borne, 
                  
                     Matt. 2.5. they said, at Bethleem in Iudaea: and they said well. But because 
                     Luc. 1.26. & 2.4. the virgin Marie and Ioseph dwelt at Nazareth in Galile, before he was borne, and 
                     Matt. 2.23. there he liued with them after, in so much that he was called Iesus of Nazareth: 
                     Ioh. 7. vers. 41.41. & 
                     
                        •
                     2. they thought he had beene borne there, not at Bethleem; and so they were deceiued, and did not know him to be Christ.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Yet this is the substance of the word of life: not that there shalbe a Christ, which the Iewes beleeue till this day; but that Iesus of Nazareth, whom they crucified, was that Christ. The Scribes and the Pharises said, he was not. Ought the Iewes herein to beleeue, as they said? If you thinke that they ought: no maruaile if you hold, that we must doo as Popes say. If you thinke, they ought not: then the Scribes and Pharises did erre in some thinge that they taught. As for that you answere, they erred in Christes person, not in expounding the law: it is a méere cauill. For we speake in generall of the chaire of Moses, that is, of his doctrine. They erred in expounding the doctrine of Moses, when they denyed to Christ the thinges which Moses wrote of him. Howbeit that it is false too, that they erred not in expounding the law. For whereas

But the Scribes & Pharises, thinking that [a neighbour] doth signifie a freend, who beareth vs good will, and him wee ought to loue: did thereupon gather and glose of the contrarie, And thou shalt hate thine enimie. Which interpretation of the law is lewd: and sheweth that they were grossely blinde in expounding it. Wherefore our Sauiour reprouing their corruptions in this and other of their doctrines, doth say to his disciples: 
                     Matt. 5 20. 
                  Except your righteousnes exceede the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharises, yee shall not enter into the kingdome of heauen.

               Our Sauiour might speake these wordes of their liues, and not of their doctrines because they were wont to say, and not to doo. As for the pointes which you say were gloses of the Scribes and Pharises: some of the Fathers take them to bée the law of Moses it selfe, corrected, and supplied, or rather perfited by Christ. So doth S.

                  Chrysostome compare the one with the other, as the olde law with the new: and saith that the commaundements

of Moses are easie, refraine from murther and adulterie; but the commaundements of Christ hard, refraine from wrath and lust. So doth S.

                  Austin séeme to haue thought also.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               They thought so, (I graunt,) good men, and well meaning, abused by the craft of the Scribes and Pharises: who, to winne the people thereby the more easily vnto their opinions, did vtter them in Moses wordes, though with an other sense then Moses. As, that which 
                     Leu. 19.12. Num. 30.3. he meant of lawfull othes, and vowes; 
                     Mat. 5.33. they turned it to vnlawfull: 
                     Exod. 21.24. of punishment by publike iudgement; 
                     Mat. 5.38. they turned it to priuate reuengement. But this shift of theirs, (which Christ doth but allude vnto, as notorious,) did cary S. 
                  
                     De Serm. Dom. in mont. l. 1. c. 21. 
                  Austin away with such a preiudice: that he thought this also to be writen in the law, (because 
                     Matt. 5.43. it cometh in, as the rest,) Thou shalt hate thine enimie; whereas the law 
                     Exod. 23.4. commaundeth men to loue their enimies, and to doo them good. The lesse maruell is it, if he were deceiued in the former pointes. In the which yet afterward he saw his errour and corrected it. For, when the Manichees, who condemned the God of the old Testament as contrarie to the new, did reason out of this place that Christ reproueth sundry pointes in the law of Moses: 
                     Augustin. contr. Faust. Manich. lib. 19. cap. 23. he answered that Christ reproueth not the law, but them who mistooke it, who thought that the forbidding of murther and adulterie did touch, not the affections and lustes, but actes onely. And though it came not then into his mind neither, that the law saith not, Thou shalt hate thine enimie: 
                  
                     cap. 24. yet hee considered, that it could not otherwise be meant in the old Testament, then, as in the new we must hate our enimies, or rather Gods enimies, hate 
                  
                     Reu. 2.6. Augustin. in Psal. 138. 
                  their vices, not their persons. S. Chrysostome in this point slipped not so much. For He saith the speech is lewd, and the thing vniust. In Matth. hom. 13. in opere imperfect.
                   his wordes thereof be such, that it séemeth not, he thought it writen in the law. If in the rest he did not retract, as Austin did: he had not the Manichees to sharpen him, as Austin had. Their folly would haue made him wiser. At least, what soeuer the Fathers thought therein: it is certaine that Christ reproued not the law of God, but the gloses of men vpon it. Which the newer writers, euen of 
                     Arias Montanus & Iohannes Ferus in Mat. 5. your owne, acknowledge: yea, 
                     In exposit. praecepti, Non occides.

                     Nic. Lira in Matt. 5. & Exod. 20. a Iewe by ofspring, conuerted to the Christian faith, doth note out of the writings of an 
                     Ioseph. antiquit. Iud. l. 12. c. 23. auncient Iewe, who

liued about the time of Christ, that the Iewes thought the outward deedes onely, and not the motions of the mind to bee forbidden by the commaundements. Wherefore in that you say, that Christ, when he taught that his disciples righteousnes ought to exceede the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharises, might speake that of their liues, and not of their doctrines: you say well of the one side, but not of the other. For he meant it of both. Which appéereth by this, that he therein giueth a reason of his former spéech, as ye word [for] doth shew: 
                     Matt. 5. ver. 20.
                  for I say vnto you, except your righteousnes excede the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharises, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heauen. Now the former spéech was, that 
                     ver. 19. 
                  who soeuer shall breake one of these least commaundements, and teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdome of heauen, that is, he shall be none in it. The Scribes and Pharises therfore, men famous for their righteousnes, who counted these commaundements (mentioned by Christ) least, that is, they made no count of them, as thinking wrath, and malice, and lust, no transgressions; are noted to haue offended not onely in breaking them, but in teaching so too. And how did they teach so, but (as Christ declareth) by misexpounding the law? Therfore in expounding the law they did erre.
            
            
               Hart.
               They did erre, after a sort: yet marke withall, how. They taught that the actions of muther and adulterie are forbidden by the law: but they taught not that the affections are forbidden. This was in deede to teach lesse then the law▪ but not to teach against the law. Yea, to hate their enimies was after a sort also commaunded in the law. For when God sent the children of Israel into the land of Canaan, 
                  
                     Num. 33.52. he charged them to cast out all the inhabitants of that land. Now those inhabitants were 
                     Deut. 6.19. 
                  their enimies: and of these enimies God saith, 
                     Deut. 7.2. 
                  Thou shalt vtterly destroy them, thou shalt make no couenant with them, nor haue compassion vpon them. Behold, they must destroy them. Was this to hate them, or no?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               It was to kill them, I am sure. And so, by your reason, the law commaunded men to kill their enimies also, not to hate them onely. But in truth they were not charged to hate them, though they were charged to destroy them. For, the inhabitants of the land of Canaan whom God did will them to

destroy, the Hittites, and Amorites, and Iebusites, and the re
                     •
                  t, were destroyed 
                     Deut. 9.5. for their wickednes, 
                  
                     Deut. 18.11. their idolatries, their sorceries, 
                  
                     Leu. 18.24. and other horrible abominations. It was a punishment then and iudgement of God, which the Israelites did execute in putting them to death. Now, to punish the wicked, is to doo them good, For (as naturall reason taught 
                     Plat. in Gorgia.
                   a Philosopher) vices in the mind, are, as diseases in the bodie; and punishments, as medicines. So that, as for a sicke man to drinke a bitter potion, or to be launced, or seared, it is good, though it be grieuous: in like sort, to be punished, is for a lewd person. Therefore when the Israelites did punish and destroy the inhabitants of Canaan: they did not hate them in so dooing; at least they were not charged to hate them. For, to hate a man, is to wish him euill. To punish an offender, is to doo him good. The charge of the Israelites was that they should punish them. In that they were therefore charged to destroy them, they were not charged to hate them. And this is yet plainer by the new Testament. Where, though 
                     Mat. 5.44. we be charged to hate no man liuing, but to loue all: yet 
                     Rom. 13.4. 
                  the sword is left to execute vengeance on him that doth euill. Wherefore (to returne vnto the point in question) when the Scribes and Pharises made that wicked glose, Thou shalt hate thine enimie: they taught against the law. And so did they too, when they taught, that euill and sinfull affections are not forbidden by the law. You say they taught lesse therein then the law, but they taught not against it. I say, they taught against it, because they taught lesse. For it is writen, 
                     Deut. 4.
                        •
                     . 
                  ye shal not adde vnto it, nor shall ye take from it. To doo lesse then it willeth, is to take from it. To take from it, is to breake it.
                     Matt 5.19. To breake it, and to teach so, was the faulte of the Scribes & Pharises. Howbeit, if you thinke them not yet sufficiently conuicted: you shall heare a farther & manifester proofe, which is without al exception. In ye law of Moses God hath commanded, 
                     Exod. 20.12. 
                  Honour thy father and thy mother
                  ▪ where the word [honour] conteineth all dueties of seruice, loue, and awe, which children owe vnto their parents. The Iewes, as they were prone to make vngodly vowes,

                     . so this was an vsuall kind of vowe amongst them, and they would bind it with an oth, that such or such a man should haue no profit by them. The othe, which they vsed herein, as most solemne, was, By the gift, or offering. For so they were instructed

               That is false first. It was not proper to the Priestes, but common to them with the Leuites: as 
                     Deut. 33.10. the wordes of Moses compared with 
                     Nehem. 8.8. their practise shew.
            
            
               Hart.
               Perhaps by [the Priestes] he meaneth the Priestly tribe, the tribe of Leui. And so I take his wordes. Then it was proper to that tribe to sit vpon the chaire of Moses. But 
                  
                     Neque Scribae ne que Pharisaei erant necessario de genere sacerdotum.

                  the Scribes were lightly of the poore tribe of Simeon, he proueth by two witnesses: the one, Rabbi Selomoh; the other, the Chaldee, vpon the nine and fourtieth chapter of Genesis.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               He abuseth two witnesses. For he séemeth by the Chaldee, to meane the Chaldee Paraphrast: and the Chaldee Paraphrast hath not a worde to that purpose. As for Rabbi Selomoh, he hath some such wordes: but D. Genebrard wresteth and depraueth them. For whereas the Rabbin saith, that 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  poore Scribes and such as taught litle children, were not but of the tribe of Simeon: he maketh him to say, that Scribes for the most part were of the poore tribe of Simeon. In the which report he committeth two faultes. One, that where his autor doth speake of poore Scribes who taught litle children, as scriueners doo with vs to write: he taketh it of great Scribes, who expounded the law to all the people, 
                     Matt. 2.5. yea, to Princes. An other, that where his autor saith, they were not but of the tribe of Simeon, which in the great Scribes would bée

cléerely false (for Ezra 
                  
                     Ezr. 7. ver. 6. 
                  the Scribe was of the

                  lightly (or, for the most part) of the tribe of Simeon. So, what Rabbi Selomoh doth absolutly deny, that Doctor Genebrard tempereth with a qualification: and of these wordes, [the poore Scribes were of the tribe of Simeon;] he maketh these, [the Scribes were of the poore tribe of Simeon.] This is a prety sleight, and such as is not common amongst the auncient Sophisters, whom

                  kes when he shall gaine so litle by them. For what if a Rabbin, a Iew, who liued of late yeres, had said, that the Scribes were not of the Leuiticall tribe? That nation is striken with madnes, and with blindnes, and with astonishment of heart, since they haue shut their eyes against 
                     Mal. 4.2.

that the Catholikes sit vpon the chaire of Christ, I must not thinke you meane of Catholikes who be scholers, but of Catholikes who be teachers; of Catholike Priestes, and Bishops. The Scribes and Pharises therefore had ordinary succession, for any thing that Genebrard sheweth to the contrarie. But they did both erre them selues, and teach errours. Then they, who succéed ordinarily, may erre and teach errours. Now the Popes succeede in the chaire of the Apostles, as the Scribes and Pharises did in the chaire of Aaron. The Popes are not warranted therefore by succession but they may erre, and teach errours.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, I denie that. For they haue greater grace then had the Scribes and Pharises. Wherefore, not, if the Scribes and Pharises erred, therefore the Popes may.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Nay, as you brew, so must you drinke. It is your owne comparison of Popes with Scribes and Pharises, euen in the chaire too. And (to say the truth) they are well compared: sauing that the Popes are somewhat behind them in succession, and farre beyond them in errours.
            
            
               Hart.
               Not so. For howsoeuer it fared with Scribes and Pharises:
                     The fifth Diuision.
                   I will proue by a manifest demonstration out of the scripture, that Popes cannot erre in doctrine.

                        ap. 9. that the scripture noteth foure kindes of men, who by teaching the folke that are named Christians, doo either leade them, or misleade them, that is, doo either guide them in the right way, or seduce them from it. The first of them, Pastors; the second, Hirelinges; the third, Theeues; and the fourth, Woolues. All whom Christ hath shewed almost in one place togither. For in S. 
                  
                     Ioh. 1
                        •
                     . 
                  Iohns gospell he saith of the theefe: He that entreth not by the doore into the sheepefold, but climeth vp an other way, he is a theefe and a robber. Of the pastor he saith; But he that entreth by the doore, is the pastor of the sheepe. And a litle after, I am (saith he) the doore. And anone, making a subdiuision of the pastor into his members, he sheweth that a pastor is of two sortes, the one, good; the other, an hireling. The good pastor (saith he) doth giue his life for his sheepe. But an hireling, and he which is not the pastor, that is, which deserueth not the name of a pastor, because hee loueth

more the goods of the world then the sheepe (saith 
                     Homil. 14. super euangelia.
                   
                  Gregorie the great) seeth the woolfe coming, and leaueth the sheepe, and fleeth. He is a theefe therefore who climeth vp an other way: that is (as 
                     Lib. 1. epist. 6. 
                  Cyprian writeth) who succeeding no man is ordeined of him selfe, not of them who entred by Christ, that is, not of Christ. Hée is a pastor, who entreth in by the doore, & loueth the sheepe: that is (as 
                     Lib. 4. cap. 4 
                  Irenee writeth) he that hath both succession from the Apostles sent by Christ, and with succession of Bishopricke hath receiued through Gods fauour, the sure and gratious gift of truth. The hireling feedeth the sheepe, vnlesse the wolfe come. For (as Gregorie saith in the place alleaged) it cannot be surely knowne, whether a man be a pastour or an hireling, if time of neede come not, if persecution and triall want. The fourth kind, is the woolfe, at whose coming the hireling fleeth. For he is a woolfe who entred in by the doore, he was ordeined lawfully: but being set in the pastours roome after ward became a woolfe. Such as S. Paule describeth; 
                     Act. 20.19. 
                  I doo know (saith he) that after my departure there wil rauening woolues enter in among you, not sparing the flocke, that is, scattering the shéepefold: and of your selues, that is, of the number and order of pastors, (
                     •
                  or such he speaketh to,) there shall arise men speaking peruerse things, to draw away disciples after them selues. Such were Arius, Macedonius, Nestorius, Marcion, Paulus Samosatenus, Eutyches, and many other Arch-heretikes: who of Bishops, and Priestes, that is, of pastors, became woolues. Wherefore of these foure kindes of men, we must loue the pastor, we must tolerate the hireling, we must beware of the theefe, (
                     De verbis 
                           ••
                        
                        min. Serm. 49. saith Austin:) and I would adde (saith D. Stapleton) we must driue away the woolfe. For the woolfe must be kept off with greater care and diligence, who commeth in the sheepes clothing, and being made a pastor doth play the woolfe, and seduceth: then the theefe who climeth vp an other way, by open wrong and iniurie. For it is inough to beware of him because of lawfull succession, which neuer is vnknowne or lieth hidden, no more then the Church it selfe. Moreouer the hireling is of two sortes. One in respect of his ende, and secret: because he dooth féede for hope of gaine or honour only, but liueth not offensiuely. An other, who is openly wicked and vngodly. The hirelings of the former sort S. Paule describeth: 
                     Phil. 1.15. 
                  Some (saith he) preach Christ for enuie and contion, that is, for honours sake: some for good will and of charitie.
                  
And what of such he thinketh, he addeth▪ 
                  but what? So that by all meanes, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ bee preached: in this also I reioyce, yea and will reioyce. Now, hée preacheth Christ by occasion, not sincerely, who doth it for his owne commodities of money, or of honour, and the praise of man (as 
                     De verbis De

                  Austin doth expound it:) and of such S. Paule saith, that hee reioyceth. So farre is he from saying, that men ought not to heare them. As for the other sort of hirelinges, that openly are wicked and vngodly: such were the Scribes and Pharises, and yet the scripture saith of them, 
                     Matt. 23.2. 
                  The Scribes & the Pharises do sit vpon the chaire of Moses. All things therefore whatsoeuer they shall say vnto you, obserue ye, and do ye. But of this I haue spoken sufficiently before. And so you may see, that hirelings, whether they be secret, or open, yet they teach the truth, & Christians are bound to heare them.

               No? Then will I make it plainer from point to point. First, al the Popes are either pastors or hirelinges. Next, pastors and hirelinges doo all teach the truth. Thirdly, I conclude▪
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Stay. I doubt of the first: or rather I doubt not of it. For although the auncient Popes (as they are called) were pastors for the most part, and hirelinges now and then some: yet after, there succeeded many theeues and robbers: and so they doo till this day.

                  Antipope, as historians do call him, not a Pope. They are Popes, who by the line of orderly succession haue folowed one an other from Peter vntill our time: whose names are enrolled both in Chronicles, and Tables, by Pontacus, Onuphrius, Genebrard, Bristow, and many other learned men. And them I meane onely, when I say that all Popes are either pastors, or hirelinges.

               I proue that in saying so you say vntruely. For they are theeues, and robbers, who enter not in by the doore into the sheepefold, but clime vp an other way. But all the Popes haue entred in by the doore into the sheepefold. Therefore not one of them hath béene a theefe and a robber.

               This is well and wisely noted by your Genebrard. Many Popes were

But here you graunt withall, that fiftie Popes or there about did not enter in by the doore. Wherein you graunt (by consequent) that they were theeues and robbers.

For properly they onely are Popes, who haue the Popedome by lawfull succession. But these men had it not by lawfull succession. Therefore they were not Popes, as we must speake of Popes now. And this is declared plainely by D.

This blemish let the writers of the Centuries acknowledge to haue sproong from the German Emperours, whom they praise so greatly. For they had taken the right of the Church to themselues, and did prouide for it by the right of Herode. Thus farre D. Genebrard. Wherby you may sée that although he graunt they were theeues and robbers, yet he denyeth they were Popes: for they did not succéede lawfully.

                  Genebrard was blinded with spite against the Centuries, and Emperours of Germany, when hee sewed these figge-leaues to couer the nakednes of his cause. For the fiftie Popes (let me call them so, that my spéeche may be the plainer,) the fifty Popes, whom you graunt to haue bene theeues and robbers, because they were vsurpers rather, then successours, as being not chosen after the maner of their auncestors, but intruded by the Emperours: the fiftie Popes began in the yeare of Christ After Genebrards account. Onuphrus and Platina differ from it somewhat in a few yeares. But that altereth not the point. eight hundred eightie & foure, when Iohn the eighth dyed; and ended in the yeare a thousand fourtie and eight, when Leo the ninth succéeded. Now the Emperours had no more so doo in the Popes election, for the later halfe of that time; then they had before, when Popes were good, (in Genebrards ei

                   it was prouided, yt none should be ordained Pope (though elected) before that his election were confirmed by the Emperour. Which order was taken for ye peace & safetie both of the countrie & the State: least, the Emperours being absent out of Italie, abiding at Constantinople, the Pope (whose autoritie was growen to be great) if he should mislike the State, or be factious, might entise both Rome and Italie to reuolt from them to their enimies, as Iustinian was perswaded that Pope Siluerius sought to doo. This order continued vntill the yeare sixe hundred eightie and sixe: about the which time

For, he considered, that since the time that Adrian the third had taken away that power from the Emperours, and left it to the people and clergie: the foule and inordinate ambition of the Romans had filled the Church with beasts, the citie with tumults, and the elections with vilanie. He saw that this outrage must be repressed some way. He thought no bridle fitter, then that the decrée of Adrian the first, who gaue the right of choosing the Pope to the Emperour, should be reuiued. And so he proposed the matter to the Councell: and the Councell agréed vpon it. Wherefore the former halfe of the fifty monsters were not intruded by the Emperours. If the later were: whose was the faute? the Emperours? or the Popes and Councels, who gaue the Emperour that right? But in déed they were not. For,

For the repressing of whose outrage, Pope Leo the eighth reuiued the law, which had beene made by Adrian the first, and repealed by the third: that no Pope elected should vndertake the Popedome without the Emperours consent. Which law being taken away by occasion that the roome was sought ambitiously in the citie, and purchased

And so you may sée the lewdnes of Genebrard, that shamelesse parasite of the Popes who without all reuerence both of God and man, doth raile, lye, and falsifie stories, to deface the Emperours, and crosse the writers of the Centuries.

                  the lawful succession was disordered then: he meant that it was broken but in some sort, as it were; or (to say the truth) rather brused, then broken; not interrupted, but disturbed. For neither Genebrard saith, nor any Catholike writer els, but that the succession of Popes hath continued, and shall vnto the end.

               Then I mistooke his meaning, touching the succession; and yours, touching the Popes. For I thought that you had denied that they were Popes, who were theeues and robbers. Now I perceiue you meant not absolutely, and simply, that they were not Popes; but that they were not Popes after a kind of sort: they were crackt Popes, as you would say, and not sound; or perhaps (in truth) rather crased, then crackt. Yet the reason which you brought why they were not Popes, doth stand in force against them still. For it is true, as you said, that they did not succeede lawfully. Wherefore, either lawfull succession is not necessarie vnto your succession: or the crased Popes were no Popes at al. They did succéede Simon, but 
                     Act.

sake. Else you spoile your Church of her gayest ornament, through which ye vnskilfull are most enamored of her. Beside that neither would it helpe your cause a whit in tryall of the issue. For sithence the Pope hath ouermaistred the Emperours, and thrust from his election, first them, then the people, afterward the clergie; & In ye yeare of Christ 1180. Concil. Lateran. sub Alexandro ter. cap. 1. brought it to a few Cardinals: there haue bene as monstrous Popes as were before, (still I except Pope Iohn the twelfth: of whom in the 1.

               Hart.
               There were many tumultes and schismes in the Church, chiefely through the Emperours meanes, before that the matter could be brought about to that perfection and ripenes which it is now at. But things began to mend from that time of disorder. For by the vertue of Leo the ninth, and the Popes folowing, that vsurpation was taken from the Emperor Henrie the fourth, although with great sturres. And so was the Sée Apostolike of Rome restored to her auncient brightnes and beauty. Whereof our owne daies haue séene the proofe and triall in many good Popes, elected lawfully, no doubt: Pius the fourth, Pius the fifth, and him who raigneth now, Gregorie the thirtéenth, a most louing father of the Churches children.

               Whether that these Popes, or other, haue béene good; and their elections lawfull: it is not the question. Perhaps you praise them for affection: perhaps they haue béene good, as Popes. For Popes in our daies are praysed for their goodnes, when they surpasse not the wickednes of other men: as a

                  Ioane, that shee was harlot to Pope Iohn the twelfth, so that Iohn and Ioane were not two Popes, but one. As for that you say that if all the stories were true, they are impertinent, sith you defend the doctrine of Popes and not their maners▪ that answere other where is fit, and to purpose; but here it cometh out of season. For, the point in question touching the Popes was, whether any of them had bene theeues & robbers. You graunted that about a fifty of them were so; and monsters too, not onely theeues: but the fault thereof you said was in the Emperours, who intruded them. I replied, that since the Cardinals did choose them, there haue béene as monstrous of them as were before, and that haue come in as vnlawfully. For proofe hereof I named Boniface the eighth, Iohn the three and twentéeth, and Alexander the sixth: who were Popes then when the election by Cardinals was growne to the perfitest, the first a thirtéene hundred, the next a fouretéene hundred, the last a fiftéene hundred yeares after Christ. That these were monstrous, their whole liues do shew: that they came in vnlawfully, their entrances. That they were as monstrous, and came in as vnlawfully, as the fiftie Popes: I will not proue, vnlesse you force me; for comparisons are odious. And here I must adde, least I be accused as partial to the Emperors, that although I cléere them from intruding those Popes, yet I cléere them not from all fault therein. For it was a fault in them, that they suffered such vilaines to enioy the roome: as it is well noted by

if he be a theefe & a robber, who entreth in vnlawfully into the shéepefolde; then many of your Popes haue béene theeues and robbers. Yet take I not aduantage of that which you haue said about the fiftie Popes. For so, not onely they, but all the rest might proue theeues.

It sufficeth me, first, that many of them purchased the Popedome with bribery and corruption, as I haue shewed by their stories: next, that all such purchasers are (by their owne law)

                  Stapleton doth define a theefe out of S. Cyprians wordes: no Pope can be a theefe. For he is a theefe, who succeeding no man, is ordeined of himselfe. Now, it is manifest that the Popes, all, both haue succéeded others, and were ordeined by others. Yet, though some of them were theeues, and robbers, in D. Genebrards sense: they could not erre in doctrine. Such is the force of succession.

               Then the Popes succession doth not warrant them but that they may be woolues. Which is as much to my purpose, as if you said, theeues, and robbers. And in very truth, vnlesse D.

                  Christ is the doore: and by him the shepeheard leadeth his sheepe in, and out, to feede them and saue them. In their ende, 
                     vers. 10. that a theefe commeth to steale, kill, destroy, that is, to spoile them of their life, of life spirituall and eternall: but the shepeheard cometh that they may haue life, and haue it in aboundance. Whereby it is euident that Christ did meane the same by theeues and robbers here, which other where by false Prophets:

                  Stapleton prayseth as best corrected, and foloweth it for aduantage: to chaunge a worde of it here, in such sort, it was a feate and had a purpose. But the second feate doth excel this. For, because Cyprian saith of a théefe, that he succeeding no man arose of him selfe: Stapleton doth take him as though he had defined a theefe by those wordes. Whereof he would haue the reader to conceiue that they who haue succession, and are ordeined lawfully, can not bee theeues: a thing which Cyprian meant not. But therein he dealeth with the wordes of

                  Cyprian as if a man should say to define a doctour: a doctour is he, who interpreteth the scriptures, that is (as 
                  
                     Lib. de vnitat. ecclesiae.
                   
                  Cyprian writeth) who doth corrupt the gospell, and is a false expounder of it. For these are Cyprians wordes, and spoken of Nouatian Doctours. But they were not spoken to define a doctour. For then they should be verified as well of all doctours, as they be of Doctour Stapleton. Yet he who should define a doctour so, to proue him one, and that out of Cyprian: should serue him such a feate as he doth serue a theefe, and take him in the snare which him selfe hath framed.
            
            
               Hart.
               As though that of theues some might be good, and some naught. There may be so of doctours.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               No. But, as doctours, some are good, some are naught; and sith that both these qualities are incident into doctours, a doctour should not be defined by eyther of them: so theeues, some succéede, some doo not succéede; and sith that both these qualities are incident into theeues, no one of them can open the nature of a theefe, nor both in déed pithily. Wherefore to say in defining a theefe, that he succeedeth no man: it is a iuggling feate, which conuerteth accidents into the shape of substance, and maketh essence of a qualitie. A feate that is vsed much by D. Stapleton, & doth amaze the simple who sée not the sleight: where they who discerne the conueiance of it, estéeme it as a feat of sophistrie. But the third feate, is a feate of foly. For when he had made foure kindes of teachers, the first, pastors; the next, hirelings; the third, theeues; the last, woolues; and graunted that they all are called to that office by lawfull succession, excepting theeues onely: he diuideth hirelings into two sortes; and hauing proued that both of them do teach the truth, concludeth therupon, that an vndouted certaintie of doctrine and faith is knit to succession. Then the which what kinde of legierdemaine can be more fond? to say in the conclusion, that they who by lawfull succession are teachers, doo surely teach the truth, because that hirelings doo, and pastours: when he had shewed before that not onely they doo succéed lawfully, but also woolues, who teach errours.
            
            
               Hart.
               It was not his meaning that succession alone hath vnd
                     •
                  uted certaintie of doctrine and faith, but, succession with vnitie. For other-where 
                     Staplet princip. doctrin. lib. 5. cap. 5. he saith, that to this prerogatiue of

Bishops and Priestes, there are required two conditions: one, that they bee lawfully ordayned, least they bee theeues, who enter in not by the doore; an other, that being lawfully ordained they keepe and holde vnitie, least they become woolues of pastours.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then is not trueth of doctrine knit necessarily to succession it selfe: no not though it bee lawfull and Apostolike succession.

               No more, then in truth and conscience they might. For though in déed that saying of S. Austin were meant of al Bishops that held the faith with concord; which our Diuines of Rhemes (I warrant you) knew well enough: yet they might apply it to the Pope, as chiefely belonging vnto him, the fountaine (as it were) of vnitie.

               Hart.
               If there were perhaps either a slippe ofmemory, or other ouersight in citing of S. Austins wordes, the matter is not great, so long as the thing is true which they be cited for: namely, that the Pope may erre in person, not in office; as a priuate man, not as Pope.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The matter is so great, that the tracke thereof will find vs out that, which by this distinction you séeke to steale away. For you say that the Pope cannot erre in office, though he may in person. And why? Because, although his person be wicked: yet in the seate hath God set the doctrine of truth, as S. Austin saith. But as S. Austin saith it, all Bishops, be they good or euill, pastors or hirelinges, doo sit in that seat. So that none of them can erre in office neither, by consequence of your reason. Wherefore if the Pope cannot erre, as Pope: a Bishop cannot erre, as Bishop. But you will not say (I thinke) that a Bishop cannot erre, as Bishop. Therefore you must yéeld, that the Pope may erre, as Pope.
            
            
               
               Hart.
               What if I said that a Bishop can not erre, as Bishop? I could maintaine it after a sort.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I doubt not of that. But you should marre the Popes priuilege: which if you doo-
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, I say it not. The fault of your argument is rather in the former part: I meane, in the ground thereofwhich you said as out of S. Austin, that the office and seate, wherein God hath set the doctrine of truth, is common to al Bishops. For, though he may séeme to haue so thought in 
                     Epist. 166. that epistle: yet in 
                     Epist. 165. the next before it, he giueth that prerogatiue to the Sée of Rome.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Unlesse your Diuines of Rhemes doo abuse him. For out of that epistle In their Annotations on Matt. 23.2. they teach vs this lesson. God preserueth the truth of Christian religion in the Apostolike See of Rome, which is in the new Law answerable to the chaire of Moses, notwithstanding the Bishops of the same were neuer so wicked of life: yea though some traitor as ill as Iudas were Bishop thereof, it should not bee preiudiciall to the Church, and innocent Christians, for whom our Lord prouiding said, Doo that which they say, but doo not as they doo. August. Epist. 165. Now, in 
                     Epist. 165. the epistle alleaged and quoted for proofe of this lesson, S. Austin saith the very same, which in 
                     Epist. 166. the other, of wicked Bishops in generall; though applying it in particular to the Bishops of Rome, if any of them had béene wicked. Your Diuines of Rhemes, leaue out

                   the generall wordes: that simple men may thinke he meant a special priuilege of the Sée of Rome. Whereto they note in the margent: The See of Rome preserued in truth. And vpon In their Annotat. on Matt. 23.3. out of Augustin. contr. literas Petilian. lib. 2. c. 51. & 61. other like places: The dignitie of the See of Rome. And that which passeth all, they say that in the newe law the See of Rome is answerable to the chaire of Moses: the Apostolike See of Rome. I was of opinion (before I saw these gloses of theirs vpon the Testament,) that Stapleton had passed all the Popes retayners in abusing Scriptures and Fathers for the Papacy. But now I perceiue and confesse, that as 
                     Ezek. 16.5

                  Ierusalem did iustifie her sister Sodom: so the Diuines of Rhemes haue iustified their brother Stapleton. For Stapleton, as he hath dealt with greater truth and honestie then they, in many other pointes▪ so hath 
                     Princip. doctri▪ l. 5. c. 9. he shewed in this of Scribes and Pharises sitting in Moses chaire, both, that the text is meant of wicked Bishops, all such as say

and doo not, and, that S. Austin giueth that sense of the text. But the Diuines of Rhemes haue set downe S. Austins name, and wordes so, as if he had thought that to be Scribes and Pharises had béene a peculiar grace vnto the Popes. And, vnder colour of his authoritie, and iudgement, they force the scriptures also to it, saying, that the chaire of Moses in the olde law was that the Sée of Rome is now, The See of Rome is answerable to the chaire of Moses. Which sentence is so grosse, that vnlesse they had hoped to finde swine in England, whom any doung would please that sauoured of the Pope, they would not haue durst to lay it on the scriptures, no not though their heartes had béene as fat as brawne, and their faces as hard as adamant.
            
            
               Hart.
               What meane you to sclaunder a college of so learned Diuines in such sort? Doth not S. Austin mention the See and Bishops of Rome in all the places which they cite, both in the epistles, and against Petilian?
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Not in all: in some he doth. But doth he mention him in any of them so, as though the chaire of Moses were proper vnto him, and he alone should sit in it?
            
            
               Hart.
               Perhaps, not expressely: yet he doth impliedly, and by a consequent. For els why made he speciall mention of him more then of others?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Because he had occasion to speake of him specially through the obiections of his aduersaries. Yet he maketh mention of other Sees and Bishops too, as 
                     Contr. liter. Petilian. lib. 2. cap. 51. of Ierusalem. But, the scripture witnesseth that 
                     Rom. 3.4. 
                  all men are lyers. If I should hence auouch that the Pope is a lyer: would you say that I auouch the Pope alone to to be a lyer, and not the Turke also?
            
            
               Hart.
               The Pope may lye by nature▪ but God by grace can free him from it.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The question is, what God doth: not what hee can doo.
            
            
               Hart.
               But as he can, so he doth, by priuilege of the Sée of Rome.

doth bring forth a reason from the chaire, that is, the Sée, and quoteth him for it. For the force (saith he) of the chaire is such, that it constraineth them to speake good thinges and true, who doo not good, nor thinke true: neither doth it suffer them to teach their owne thinges, but the things of God. Augustin. lib. 4. de dectr. Christ cap. 27. & epist. 166.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Of the two places, whence he gathereth this, the former agreeth fully with the later; the later is the same that your Diuines of Rhemes abuse, as I haue shewed. In both S. Austin speaketh of wicked Bishops generally, not specially of the Pope. In both he meaneth the office of teaching by [the chaire:] the office, committed not to one Bishop, but to all. If Genebrard doo take [the chaire] in this sense: how proueth it your priuilege? If he meane the Sée of Rome by [the chaire:] then is there 
                     Ezek. 22.25. 
                  a conspiracie of Prophets among you, as there was among the Iewes, and Genebrard is one of them.
            
            
               Hart.
               It is not likely that S. Austin vsed the name of the chaire, for the office of teaching, which is common to all Bishops, as well to hirelinges, as to pastors. For he saith that the chaire constraineth them to speake good thinges and true: the chaire constraineth them. How are they constrained but by a speciall grace for the benefite of the Church? And in what Bishops may this grace be shewed, but in the Popes onely?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  S. Austin, as he noteth that grace in the Popes, so doth he shew it in all other Catholike Bishops of his time, whose doctrine the Donatists (against whom he writeth) did not reproue, but their maners. He calleth 
                     August. epist. 166. 
                  the chaire, (in which they all sit) the chaire of wholsome doctrine: and saith, they are constrained to speake good thinges in it. He openeth the cause why they are constrained: 
                     De doctrin. Christian. lib. 4. cap. 27. to wéete, that although they seeke their owne thinges; yet 
                  
                     Sua docere non audent.
                   
                  they are afraid, and dare not teach their owne thinges, out of the pulpit of that Church in which sound doctrine is established. So that the speciall grace, whereby they are constrained to speake good thinges and true: is an vngratious grace, whereby they are induced to séeke their wealth or honour. For,

them, that it doth moue them effectually and forcibly to preach in such sorte as is fit to get or keepe the thinges which they loue. And hereupon S. Austin saith, they are constrained and inforced to it: as 
                     Gal. 2.14. 
                  Paul said to Peter that he constrained the Gentiles to doo like the Iewes, because by his example hee moued them effectually; as

                  Laelius told his friendes that they constrained him to graunt them a thing, which they by earnest suite intreated. For that he vsed the worde [constraine] in that sense: himselfe hath declared 
                     Libr. de pastoribus cap. 10. other-where, by saying, that 
                     Velint nolint pastores vt perueniant ad lac & lanam, verba Dei dicturi sunt.
                   
                  shepeheardes (he meaneth hirelinges) will they, nill they, will say the wordes of God that they may come to milke and wooll. The spéech may séeme harsh, that shepeheardes will they, nill they, will say the wordes of God: but hee speaketh so, to note that the loue of milke and of wolle, that is, of commodities, constraineth them to féede the sheepe with Gods worde, whether they like of it, or no. Now because the doing herof is in, and by, their office of teaching, which the chaire betokened, as, the chaire of Moses: therefore 
                     De doctrin. Christian. l. 4. 
                        •
                     . 27. he saith that Moses chaire did constraine the Scribes and Pharises to say good thinges; and that 
                     Epist. 166. amongst Christians, hirelinges are constrained to say them in the chaire too. As if I should say, when in the Church of England a Papist preacheth against Poperie, a worldling against worldlinesse, an hypocrite against hypocrisie, (which some times they doo:) the pulpit constraineth them to preach so. You should mistake me, if you should imagin that I meane our pulpit hath a speciall grace to kéepe all preachers still from errour. Euen so doo they S. Austin, who dreame of such a chaire in his wordes. Howbeit, if you thinke that a chaire with him is of greater force, then a pulpit with vs: yet you can not thinke but that his wordes spoken of the Scribes and Pharises are meant of all Bishops, who say and doo not. For so he expoundeth the Scribes and Pharises often, euen in the same

Wherefore if the Pope by vertue of the chaire cannot erre as Pope: then an other Bishop cannot erre as Bishop by vertue of the same chaire. But any other Bishop, you graunt, may erre as Bishop. Therefore you must graunt, the Pope may erre as Pope.

               Nay, I will graunt rather that S. Austin erred, and

laide a false ground: if he doo impart the priuilege of the chaire to all other Bishops as well as to the Pope.

               Then you must graunt withall that Genebrard and your Rhemists haue abused S. Austin, to bring him as for that, which he is flat against. But I will defend S. Austin in a truth: and proue that the argument which I haue grounded on him is so sure and sound, that you must néedes graunt it, vnlesse you will be froward wilfully.

               Not a Prince? Why?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Because a Prince is, as it were, a physician of the common wealth: and a physician can not erre, as physician. For in that he erreth, he misseth of his arte. Wherefore, by want of physicke he erreth, not by physicke. And so (to speake exactly) no artificer can erre: at the least he cannot erre as an artificer. For he which erreth, erreth because he hath not skill enough, and not because he hath skill.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               But yet an artificer may erre in practise of his arte: as a physician, in curing sicke men: a Prince, in ruling the common wealth. And therefore, me thinketh, that shift is but a quidditie. For an artificer may be iustly saide to erre as an artificer, when he doth erre in that which he dealeth with in respect of his arte. At least, if he erre not therein as an artificer, he erreth as an euill artificer.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               That is true, as an euill artificer.
            
            
               Hart.
               Then your man in Plato must amend his spéech: and say, that a Prince may erre as an euil Prince, though he cannot, as good; and a magistrate, as an euill magistrate.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               And of a physician he must amend it too: and say, that a physician if he cure not the sicke wel, doth erre as an euill physician.
            
            
               Hart.
               He must so.

               Likewise if an auditor doo misse in casting of accounts: he erreth as an euill auditor.

               And if a cooke doo misse in dressing of meate, he

erreth as an euill cooke; a tayler in making garments, as an euill tayler; a shoomaker in making shooes, as an euill shoomaker.

               We must so, it seemeth, by proportion to the rest.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But perhaps we haue dealt too hardly with the rest. And now in Bishops I perceiue it. For would you call S. Austin, and S. Cyprian, euill Bishops?
            
            
               Hart.

               Yet they haue erred sometimes in diuiding the worde of truth: as you confesse of the

                  there is none good, but one, euen God. But if we speake as men are commonly wont: we may not call the best, euill. Wherefore I am loth to say, that a Bishop erreth as an euill Bishop, if he erre in diuiding the word of truth. I had rather say, that he erreth as Bishop offending in a point of duetie. And so would I mitigate our spéeches of the rest: not to call them euill, whom all account good; but to note that good, in men, hath imperfection.

               I was of that minde at the first.

               Rainoldes.
               Is not the Pope a Bishop? the Bishop of Rome, I trow.
            
            
               Hart.
               I thought that hether you would at last. And therefore I did purposely except him by name. For it is true in all Bishops, saue in the Bishop of Rome.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I know you did except him: but with what reason? For if it be true in generall of Princes, that they may erre as Princes; it foloweth in speciall that any Prince may erre as Prince: the Quéene of England, as Quéene; the King of Scotland, as King; the German Emperour, as Emperour; and so forth all the rest, whose office is Princely. This you graunt. Doo you not?
            
            
               Hart.
               Yes, it is so in Princes, I graunt.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then, in like sorte, if it be true of Bishops that they may erre as Bishops, it foloweth that any Bishop may erre as Bishop: the Patriarke of Venice, as Patriarke: the Cardinall of Alba, as Cardinall; the Pope of Rome, as Pope; and so forth all the rest, whose office is Bishoply. Doth not reason teach you, that you must graunt this also?
            
            
               Hart.
               No. Because the state and condition of Bishops is not like to Princes in this consideration. For amongst Princes there is none priuileged by vertue of his office not to erre, as Prince. But amongst Bishops the Pope of Rome is priuileged not to erre, as Pope.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The date of this priuilege is out, M. Hart: it cannot serue you now. For your selfe misliked Thrasymachus in Plato as shifting with a quidditie, for saying that a Prince cannot erre as Prince.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               And I mislike him still.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               You confessed also, that an artificer may be iustly said to erre as an artificer, when he doth erre in that which hee dealeth with in respect of his arte.
            
            
               Hart.
               I did so. What then?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               And you thought it méete, that we should say a

Bishop erreth as Bishop, when he erreth in a peint of the Bishops dutie.
            
            
               Hart.
               And this I graunt too.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               How can you deny then, but the Pope may iustly be saide to erre as Pope, when he erreth in a point of ye Popes duty? And sith a point thereof, is, to diuide the word of truth aright, belonging to him, as to all Bishops, by the chaire & seate, that is, the office of teaching, wherin God hath set them: the Pope is not priuileged by vertue of the chaire from erring as Pope, more then all Bishops are priuileged as Bishops. That, if an other Bishop may erre notwithstanding as Bishop, which you graunt: you must néedes graunt the Pope may also erre as Pope. Yea, though all Popes were pastors or hirelinges, and none of them theeues: yet might they erre as Popes too. For S. Austin and S. Cyprian erred, as Bishops. Yet they were pastors both.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, the Pope certainly can not erre as Pope, that is to say, in office: though he may in person, as Pope Honorius did.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Nay in Pope Honorius you are cast certainly. For I haue proued now that he wrote that as Pope, which he was condemned for: and therefore erred as Pope.
            
            
               Hart.
               It may séeme he wrote it as Pope, & so erred. But that is not enough to proue that ye Pope may erre in office, as I take it.

                  To proue it then more fully: let vs sée first, what is the office of the Pope, that so it may appeere whether hee may erre in office, or no. S. Peter the Apostle writing vnto Elders, by whom he meaneth Bishops and all who haue the charge of soules (as

Wherein he chargeth them to preach the word of God, and leade a godly life: that they may féede the Church both with doctrine and example. This is the Popes office, I thinke, if he be a Bishop: for it doth touch them all. But what thinke you of it, least I lose my labour through an [except the Pope:] doth it touch all Bishops, or al saue him onely?

               By your confession then vpon the scripture, with the Councell, the office of a Bishop requireth three thinges: that he preach faithfully, that he liue vprightly, and that he be resident on his charge. But the Bishop of Rome may erre in each of these. Therefore in office he may erre. How say you? May he not?

               He may erre in office, if he may erre in any of them: for each of them toucheth his office, you grant. But I proue, in them all. And to beginne with the last: he may be non-resident. For he was so by the space of threescore and ten yeares togither: all the which time,

Whom when he had asked, why he went not to his charge, from which a Pastor ought not to be so long absent: the Bishop answered him, And why most holy Father, go not you to yours? The Pope was not so wise to replie, as you doo, that the whole world was his charge: but being moued with the iust reproofe of his fault hee went to Rome straight. And when after his death the Cardinals were to choose a newe Pope:

               It is superfluous to rehearse more of their stories. We graunt, as I haue said, that they may erre in maners. And in déede non-residence is a fault rather of maners, then of doctrine. Wherefore though they may erre in residence and life: they cannot erre in doctrine. And that is it, which wee defend.

               I speake not of their doctrine now, but of their office. In two pointes whereof you graunt that they may erre. The third is as manifest. For he which now is Pope, Gregorie the thirteenth, preacheth not at all. If he preach not at all: he preacheth not faithfully. If he preach not faithfully: then may he erre in that point too.

               That is a greater proofe, that the Popes vse not commonly to preach. For Surius doth likewise note of him also, that he suffered fewer Courtisans in Rome, and them in streets lesse famous: because they dwelt before

                  in the hie streetes & gorgeous houses in great number. And peraduenture Surius who prayseth Pius for his preaching, made the most of it. Pope Pius was aliue, when Frier Surius praysed him. Moreouer Surius reckeneth this amongst his prayses, that in a procession he was not caried on mens shoulders (as Popes are wont to be) but

                  he went a foote to the great edifying of the people. Small preaching of the Pope may be praysed as great: when his going a foote shall edifie the people so. Neither yet doth Surius report of his preaching more then to the clergie. Of sermons to the people he giueth him this prayse, that he vouchsafed them of his presence at solemne times. Belike he did edifie the people enough with going a foote. But if Pope Pius had preached to the people as well as to the clergie: one swallowe makes not summer; his preaching had not done his duetie.

                   that Pope Iulius the secōd was requested to make one Giles, (a lerned Frier,) Cardinall. To the which intent whē it was alleaged that the man had learning & preached diligently: nay marry, quoth the Pope, that is the onely reason, why I can not make him Cardinall with safe conscience, that he may preach the worde of God the better still, which he might not if he were Cardinall. For that is verie farre from the dignitie and custome of Cardinalls, (saith Pacie,) and therefore Pope Iulius, as he was a Pastour most carefull of the flocke, would not agree to that request. Now, if it be so straunge for Cardinalls to preach: what thinke you of the Popes them selues, who are more occupied with affaires of state, and may lesse attend so base thinges as preaching? As the example sheweth of the same Iulius. Who bending all his powers (

               You are not sure that neither of them did euer preach. But if they were not able to preach by them selues: yet they might preach by others. And so I am sure that our most holy

Father Gregory the thirtenth doth faithfully discharge that dutie.

                  Belvedere by him selfe, and preach the worde of God by others. If you thinke the Pope may be discharged so for this point of a Bishops dutie: it was an ouersight that you forgot it in the former. For you might say as well, that if he be not resident by him selfe, he may by others: and if he liue not godly by him selfe, he may by others. And thus, although the Pope be damned by himselfe: yet with your distinction he may be saued also. He may be saued by others.
            
            
               Hart.
               The case in these thinges is not like. For all are bound to leade a godly life by them selues: and he, who is not resident by himselfe, is not resident.

               So he, who doth not preach by himselfe, doth not preach. For therefore is a pastor bound to personall residence, that he may attend his flocke by himselfe, & preach vnto it personally. Which you may learne by the decrée of the Councel of Lateran made against non-residence, & pluralities, a roote of it.

                   amongst workemen there is a great difference both of wit, and nature, and knowledge, and instruction. A man who desireth to haue a faire and strong house, chooseth him a workeman, whom he knoweth to bee a wise and skilfull builder, and couenanteth with him to build his house thus and thus. If this builder doo not build the house himselfe, but get an other to doo it: he hath built it by another, but he hath not discharged his dutie. Why? Because the owner did regard his skill, when he made choise of him, and meant that himselfe should be the builder of it. The like may be obserued in Noble men and Counsellors, whom Princes put in trust with matters of importance.

               True. But this exception hath nothing to your purpose. For it is not expressed in the tenor of the commission, which Christ hath made to Bishops, that they may do their duetie by them selues, or by others.
            
            
               Hart.
               Why, then if a Bishop be sicke, extremely sicke, so that he is not able to moue out of his bedde, much lesse to come into the pulpit: yet he is bound still to preach by him selfe, because it is his duetie.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Nay, if he be sicke, it is his duetie then not to preach by him selfe. God hath layed an other duetie vpon him, to

looke to his health that he may do his former duetie: or, (if his appointed time be fulfilled,) to thinke vpon a higher duetie. But by this reason no Christian is bound to come to Church by him selfe. For he is not bound if he be sicke extremely. Neither hath the Pope néede to preach by others. For, if he be sicke that hee cannot preach, he is discharged before God: yea, although no other doo preach in his stéede.
            
            
               Hart.
               But it is better yet, if he supplie his roome by others.

Whatsoeuer I lay thereon, it will bee bloodied: and it will turne to greater shame and confusion, that I should seeke to couer that which cannot be couered. These thinges S. Bernard wrote about the time of Pope Eugenius the third, (aboue foure hundred yeares agoe,) when Popes either had, or made a semblaunce of more honestie. What would he haue writen, if he had liued since, vnder Boniface the eighth, or Vrban the sixth, or Boniface the ninth, or Iohn the three and twentéeth, or Paule the second, or Alexander the sixth, or Leo the tenth, or him of whom I talked last, the warriour Iulius? Wherefore if I should seeke to couer them now, when in Bernards time they could not be couered: the shame which he feared might fall vpon me, and mine owne conscience would condemne me. Looke you to it, M. Hart, who sooth vp those men of sinne in their iniquities; and call their furies, fraileties; and make a Noe, of a

You say that you meant by the great affaires of the Churches state, the affaires of religion and gouernment of the Church throughout all Christendome. Whatsoeuer you meant: that is the truth which I shewed by the affaires of Pope Iulius. For in the Popes language, the name of [the Church] doth signifie the Papacie, that is, the dominion and princehood of the Pope, in things both temporal and spirituall.

                  If any man haue not care of his owne,

and specially of his domesticals: he hath denyed the faith, and is worse then an infidell. Wherefore you must consider that the Pope susteineth a double person as it were: the one of a Prince, the other of a Bishop. As a Prince, he gouerneth his temporall dominion: as a Bishop, his spirituall. His spirituall charge is all the churche of Christ: his temporall, a part of it. And so, though both of them concerne after a sorte the state of the Church: yet his affaires spirituall, which stretch through all Christendoom, doo differ from his temporall, which touch the Church of Rome chieflie. For example, 
                     Sigon de regno Ital. lib. 8. 
                  Leo the ninth, a verie good Pope, aboue fiue hundred yeares since, when the Normans spoiled the land of the Church and he had cursed them for it, but could not conquer them by curses: he got of the Emperor a strong band of soldiours, whom he lead in person himselfe against the varletes, and met them in the field manfully. At the same time Michael the Patriarke of Constantinople denyed the supremacie of the Church of Rome, and claimed it to his own Sée. Whereof when Pope Leo heard, he sent thrée legats to Constantinople, to root out that heresie. Now the former of these thinges he did as Prince, against the Normans, who set vpon his temporall dominion with armes: the later, as Bishop, against the Patriarke, who taught heresie, a point of his spirituall charge. Affaires of this later sort let me name (for difference sake) the Church-affaires; the former, the affaires of state. And so it shall appeere, what iniurie you doo them, whom spitefully you call Herodes. For you say that the affaires which they are busied about, are their affaires of state. Whereas in verie truth the affaires of the Church doo busie them a great deale more: to sée that the Catholike religion be taught, that errors be suppressed; to prouide dioceses of good and learned Bishops, and parishes of able pastors: to heare appeales, determine causes, receiue supplications, excommunicate the wicked, absolue the repentant: to doo the whole function of supreme heades of the Church. And may not these affaires so weightie in charge, in number so manie, bee a iust excuse for them if they preach not? Or will you slaunder them that they omit that dutie for their state-affaires, when they omit it for the Church?

Better had it béene and would be for poore Christians: of whom they haue murdered more soules, nay more thousands of soules, in one countrie, with their Herodian practises; then 
                     Mat. 2.16. Ioseph. Antiquitat. Iudaicar. lib. 17. cap. 8. 
                  Herode murdered bodies through his whole dominion. And this haue they doon by that prophane policie, wherewith I iustlie charged them: euen by pretending the Churches state, to plant their owne; and vsing the shewes of gouernment spirituall to get them temporall aduancement. For vnder the coolour of binding and loosing, the credit of forgiuing sinnes, the title of S. Peters keyes, their ordering of the whole Church, and highest power in al Church-causes: they haue raised vp ye tower of their Papacie with the spoiles of Christendom, and haue deuoured men as breade, and sold the poore for siluer, that they might make themselues strong in power and rich in wealth. The first, and chiefest meanes, whereby they finished this worke, and hauing built the walles by climing vp aboue Bishops, did lay the roofe of it by climing vp aboue Emperours, was excommunication. Which they, not content to vse against their Souerains as a spirituall ceasure, did racke it to a ciuill punishment; remouing them, not onelie from the communion of the faithfull, but also from dominion and rule ouer their subiectes; and putting them, as from the Church, so from the Empire too. When Emperour Leo the third, desirous to abolish the worship of Images (which then was créeping in) had caused them to be defaced, and thereupon did punish some who withstood it: 
                     Sigon. de regno Ital. lib. 3. Pope Gregorie the second did excommunicate him in that Papal sorte,

                   forbidding the Italians to pay him tribute, or obey him. Upon this sentence and inhibition of the Pope, a great part of Italie rebelled against their Emperour resiant at Constantinople, and laid violent handes vpon his Deputies & Lieutenants, of whom they slew two, and put out the eyes of the third. By reason of which vprore and tumults ensuing, part of the countrie, that rebelled, was conquered by the king of Lombardie: Rome and the dominion of the Roman Dukedome fell vnto the Pope. So the Pope, who till that time had béene a Bishop onely, In the yeare of Christ 727. became a Prince by treason. But the Emperour sent another Deputie into Italie to stay those attemptes. Who entring into league with the king of Lombards, they ioined hostes togither and besieged Rome. The Pope perceiuing that the garrisons and munitions wherewith he had fensed and fortified the citie, were not strong

enough to make his partie good against them: trusting on the king of Lombards deuotion, he went out with a solemne procession vnto him, and with many swéete wordes of Peter and Paul,

Afterwarde a Duke one of the kinges subiects, entending to reuolt from him, did ioine in league and fréendship with the Roman Prince, Pope Gregory the third, and on the affiance thereof he rebelled. The king hauing recouered his Dukedom by armes, pursued the Duke to Rome. The Pope, not willing to deliuer the rebell, nor able to defend the citie against the king who thereupon besieged it, dealt (as his predecessour had doon) by supplication. But finding the matter to be past intreatie, and hoping for no aide in Italie: hee sent to Charles Martell, the king of Frances hye steward, desiring him

Which to bring about with greater credit and autoritie, the Popes aduise was asked. Pope Zacharie made answere, that he, who did execute the dutie of the king ought to be king rather, then he who did not execute it. Whereupon the French men chose Pipine to be king: the Pope released them of their oth to Chilperike. About a two yeares after, the king of Lombardy hauing woon Rauenna, (which citie was the seate of the Empire in Italy,) thought it méet that Rome and the Roman Dukedom should now be subiect to him, who raigned in the imperiall citie, as it had béene afore time to the Emperour. In this consideration he moued warre against Stephen, the successour of Zacharie. Pope Stephen remembring his predecessors benefite bestowed on king Pipine, went to him into France: and putting him in minde of Zacharies good turne, prayed him to vndertake

The chiefest meanes whereby they cast of this yoke also, was excommunication, not Christian but Papall excommunication, such as they had practized against the Gréeke Emperour. Pope Gregorie the seuenth was the beast that did it. The occasion was the giuing of Bishoprickes and church-liuings, which

                     Sigon. lib. 12. The Pope who crowned him (it was Pope Nicolas Breake-speare, called Adrian the fourth,) sending by occasion two legates vnto him, Rowland, and Bernard, Cardinals, with letters concerning the thing for which hée sent them: did mention therein what honorable curtesie hee had shewed the Emperour, and giuen him this

                  bestowed the crowne of the Empire on him. Which letters being read, the Emperour and his Nobles tooke it very euill that the Pope should write that he had giuen the Emperour the crowne of the Empire by way of a benefite. And fearing least thereby he should meane that, 
                     Quod quidam etiam dictitabant.

                   the picture & verses in the Palace of Lateran did plainely signifie as much:) they could not containe their griefe, but they must needes say, that the Empire is not the Popes benefite. To whom when Cardinall Rowland, one of the legates, replyed, And whose is it then, if it bee not the Popes? Otho, the Countie Palatine, standing by, was moued so with that spéech, that he drew his sword and would haue slaine the Cardinall. But the Emperour stayed him, and willed the legates to get them backe to Rome straight, and signified by letters throughout all Germanie what embassage the Pope had sent him: adding that he acknowledged the Empire to be giuen him by God alone, and by the Princes who had chosen him; and therefore desired them, that they would not suffer the maiestie of the Empire, so worthily gotten by their auncestours, to be empaired by their default. The Pope, vnderstanding by the returne of his legates both in what perill they had béene, and what the Emperour answered: wrote letters thereupon to the Bishops of Germanie, wherein he willed them to deale with the Emperour & make him do his duetie. The Bishops spake vnto him, & he answered them, yt 
                  he obeied the Pope

gladly: but the crowne of the Empire hee accounted him selfe to haue receyued of God chiefly, and next of the Princes Electours of Germanie; his regall coronation, of the Bishoppe of Cooleine; his imperiall, of the Pope. As for the Cardinalls whom the Pope had sent: hee forbad them to go forward, because he found that they had brought letters from the Pope to the endamaging of the Empire. Heretofore the Empire hath lifted vp the Church: but now the Church (saith he) doth presse downe the Empire.

This answere of the Emperour séemed so reasonable to the German Bishops: that they aduised and wished Pope Breake-speare to pacifie his wrath with a gentler embassage. The Popes chiefest instruments to plucke downe Henry the third, were the German Bishops. Wherefore Pope Breake-speare, perceyuing that they were not so forwarde against Friderike, as they had béene against Henry, was f

                  Venice, in Italie, haue tried to their smart. But the Church hath tried it with greater smart in her spiritual pastors. For, as Samuell, when the Israelites would haue a king to rule them, (as other nations had,) 1. Sam. 8.11. tolde them that the king, who should raigne ouer them, would play the king with them, and theirs; hee would take their sonnes and appoint them to waite vpon him, to bee his horsmen, footemen, captaines, to eare his land, to reape his haruest, to make him instruments of warre, & instruments to serue his charets; he would take their daughters to dresse him sweete ointments, and be his cookes, and bakers; hee would take their fieldes, and vineyardes, and oliue trees, the best, & giue them to his seruants; yea the tenth of their seede, and of their vineyardes, & giue it to his courtiers, and to his seruants; he would take their men, their maydes, their youth, their cattel, & put them to his worke; he would take the tenth of their flockes; and, to conclude, they should be his seruants: euen so, when the Pope had gotten the kingdome, that is, the supremacie, ouer the Israelites of God, that is, Christians; he tooke their sonnes & daughters, nay their fathers and mothers, who should beget them in the gospell, and féede them with the milke of life, and appointed them to serue him, to be his Chauncellors, Treasurers, Secretaries, Maisters of requestes, Clerkes of the Escheker, Legates, in peace to goe on embassages, in warre to looke vnto his armies; he tooke their bishoprickes, and benefices, and prebendes, the best, and gaue them to his seruants, yea the first fruites and tithes of their liuings, and gaue them to his Courtiers

and to his seruants; he tooke their pastours, their doctours, their elders, their deacons, and put them to his worke; hee tooke the tithe of their Churches, nay their whole Churches; and, to conclude, both they and theirs were made to serue him. If you, M.

                   that there are three sortes of the Church-officers which are named Cardinals, the first Bishops; the second, Priestes; and the last, Deacons: Priestes, and Deacons, of the parishes that are within Rome; Bishops, of the cities that lie néere about it. When Rome had receiued the Christian faith, and the Church encreased there from day to day; the faithfull were diuided into sundry parishes for their better gouernment, and had Elders and Deacons ordeined to attend them. 
                     Presbyteri.
                   
                  Elders, or, as you terme them, Priestes, (and I will cal them so, because I speake of Cardinals knowne by that title,) were they to whom the charge of ministring the word and sacracraments; Deacons, to whom the care for the poore of the church, and their prouision, was committed. Now at first, the parishes had each but one Priest, while they being small, one pastor could discharge the duetie. But after, when the number of the faithfull grewe, each of them had more. And 
                     Cardinales Presbyteri.
                   hence did the name of Cardinals arise, that he who was chiefe amongst the Priestes of one parish was called the Cardinall Priest, that is to say, principall. In like sort 
                     Cardinales Diaconi.
                   when the seuerall wardes of the citie could not be serued by seuerall Deacons, but each of them had moe: the chiefe amongst the Deacons of the same ward, was called the Cardinall Deacon. The name being worshipfull amongst Priestes and Deacons of the citie of Rome, 
                  
                     Cardinales Episcopi.
                   spread to the Bishops that dwelt néere about, and they were called Cardinall Bishops, though it were long first. For 
                     Apud veteres inauditum, Episcopum Cardinalem dici.
                   amongst the auncients it was neuer heard of; neither might with reason,

fith they, being equall in power to other Bishops cannot be called Cardinall in respect of them. Yet in time, by custome, I know not how, they got it. Wherefore of the Cardinals of Rome, six are Bishops, the Bishop of Alba, Tusculum, Praeneste, Sabine, Portuese, and Ostia: the rest, whose number in olde time was certaine according to the number of parishes and wardes, now they are more or fewer, as the Pope will, (they were three score and three In the yeare of Christ 1557. when this was writen by Onuphrius) but all the rest are Priestes, or Deacons And for almost twelue hundred yeares after Christ, although the Pope employed them much in his affaires, yet ordinarily they liued on their charge, and kept their calling and degree. The honour & power of Cardinall Bishops, was as the Bishops of other cities. The Cardinal Priests, and Deacons, were neither Bishops themselues, nor equall vnto them in dignitie. And if a Cardinall Priest were chosen (as worthy of a greater charge) to be a Bishop els where: he left his place in Rome and ceased to be Cardinall, because 
                     Antiquis canonibus cautum, vnum hominem non nisi vno sacerdotio potiri posse.
                   it is ordered by the auncient rules of ecclesiasticall discipline, that one man may haue but one ecclesiasticall charge, and therefore no man might be a Cardinall Priest of Rome, and Bishop of an other Church. But

He decked them with honour of wearing redd hattes: and going, first, before Bishops; afterward, before Arch-bishops; and at the last, before Patriarkes.

Yea, they were glad to be so, because the Cardinalship was a degree vnto the Popedome.

their charge of Cardinall Priestship and Deaconship in Rome: but for the better maintenance of their owne porte, and strengthning of the Popedome, he suffered them to keépe the liuings of their Bishoprickes and Cardinalships both. Wherein least he might séeme to breake that rule of discipline, one man to haue but one charge: he tooke order that they should not be called Bishops though they had Bishoprickes. How then? Forsooth, a Bishop, if he were made Cardinall Deacon, must be called elect Bishop: if he were made Cardinall Priest, must be called perpetuall administrator of his Bishopricke. As namely Thomas Wolsey Archbishop of Yorke, when he was made Cardinall parish-priest of Rome, he must be called, not Archbishop, but Cardinall Woolsey,

                  in perpetuall administration. So by these deuises (which all were inuented by the Popes at Auinion) they had now disfurnished many Churches of Bishops, to furnish, in word, the Church of Rome with Priestes, and Deacons; in déede, the Court of Rome with rich and mightie Cardinals. Yet this is the least parte of that abomination of desolation, which they haue set in the holy places. For vnder pretense, that it is their duetie to sée that all Churches be prouided of fitte pastors, they haue

                  reserued Church-liuings, when and which they listed, to their own bestowing, and them haue they seazed on to maintaine the port of their Cardinals too. This was not onely done, but also professed to be done to that ende by Clemens the sixth. Who hauing made new Cardinals, reserued the benefices in England that were void, and should be void next, (besides Bishoprickes & Abbeies) to the summe of two thousand markes,

                   then made, were twelue. Two of them he furnished with so many benefices, as should be woorth two thousand markes. I cannot say precisely what number that might be. But it must be noted that (as the rate of money and price of thinges hath growen) a benefice, worth thrée hundred markes or better now, was then not worth a hundred; neither did the Pope choose the fattest benefices but such as next came to the net: and hee meant his Cardinals should haue that pension cléere, besides their farmers shares, and vicars, or curates. So that the two Cardinals (by probable coniecture) might haue an hundred benefices before they had their yearely two thowsand marke pension. But let it be eightie, seuentie, sixtie: let it be fiftie: or, if that séeme too much, let it be fortie. The Pope did prouide, as for them, so for the rest: who being ten mo, must haue two hundred by proportion. Which proportion if it be drawne to all, nay to halfe, nay to a quarter of the Cardinals, whom Clemens and his successours haue made sith that time Sith the yeare of Christ 1343. in the which Pope Clemens m

For whatsoeuer made against the tenor of his bull, he vsed to remoue it with a Non obstante. As, for example, the Churches law and order confirmed by a Councell, was, that one man should haue but one benefice, and none should haue any, but he, who could himselfe discharge the duetie personally. The Pope

And these thinges were promised: but they were promised onely. For after that the Councell was dissolued once, the Pope played the Pope, and

                  the Popes eschequer is like vnto the Sea, whereinto all riuers doo runne, and yet it ouerfloweth not. Fourthly, by abusing of the Churchcensures: for what els should I call it? when they haue vsed them as instruments of violence, to compasse all that they did couet. If any, eyther Patrone, or Bishop, or Archbishop refused to commit the charge of English flockes to Roman pastors, or rather woolues: if any reproued the wicked sale and godlesse chaffer of their dispensations, absolutions, pardons: if any would not yeelde to pay them such taxes as they required by their legats, their marchants, their collectors, their nuntios, spies, & poursuiuāts: straight, as ye person was, so came a censure out against him, either suspension from administring his office, or interditement from vse of Church-seruice, or excommunication from the felowship of Christians, or citing him to Rome to chastise him by correption, or denouncing him an heretike if he continued rebellious, and then the secular power must burne him. A practise so common, that ordinarily the Auditour of the Popes Eschequer is autorized to excommunicate and execute other

censures, if the Courtisans, (who pay tribute for license to bee common whoores) & other farmers of holy rents, kepe not touch in bringing in. And because these censures haue not preuailed alwayes to atchieue their purposes: therefore as they enlarged them against ciuill powers to purchase somewhat thence, (as from the king of England, beside his Peter-pence, a thousand markes yearely, which yet was but a pety-larceny:) so they strengthned them against ecclesiasticall by the othe of fealty (which they haue woon of Prelats,) to maintaine the Papacie and royalties of S. Peter. Chiefly by winding in autoritie withal, that they may depriue them, and none may depriue Bishops, but they. That if Bishops will not agrée to them in all thinges, when they are commanded in vertue of obedience: yet for feare of léesing their liuinges and promotions, yea their libertie, yea their life, (if they be in the Popes subiection) they may learne to serue their Lord. But the head of all, whereby those wilde boares haue made the chiefest wast of the Lordes vineyarde, is the fifth and last point: their making and establishing of the Church-lawes. For if they had doon, and onely doon these vilanies: they might séeme to haue doon them, as men, not as Popes; and it might be hoped, when one tyrant were gone, the next would gouerne well. But they haue confirmed the dooing of them by their lawes, and procured those lawes to be receiued as canons & rules of the Church-gouernment: their Decretals, their Clementines, their Extrauagants, in déed extrauagant, their constitutions Apostolike, and their vnruly rules of the Apostolike chauncerie. The grosse intent and practise whereof is so palpable, that Budaeus, a learned lawier, the French kinges secretarie, making a complaint of the great disorder of the Popes, and clergie, doth lay the blame thereof vpon their lawes and iurisdiction.

                           I pray, M. Hart, make and penne your owne answere to this last speech of mine. If you can iustifie the Pope in those things which I haue laid vnto his charge: I will subscribe to all Popery.

                           To this request, & offer, M. Hart sent me his answere in writing. Which I haue set downe (here following) word for word, and so haue proceeded on in our conference, as he desired me to doo.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        If you speake vnfainedly, M. Rainoldes, as I trust you doo:
                              The seuenth Diuisiō.
                            I must loue you the better for your plaine dealing in so weightie a matter. That you doo not see how the Pope may be iustified, (I speake not of his naughtie and corrupt maners, but of his supreme and soueraine authoritie, which is, as I take it, agreeable to the Scripture, and Christes owne appointment:) it séemeth to me that your errour herein procéedeth of a wrong perswasion, that he had not that authoritie by right, but vsurped it. Which is not so: as I haue alreadie shewed in part, and now will proue vnto you farther. For it is so farre off from being vsurped authoritie, that if we will weigh thinges but with indifferencie and in equall balance, you shall well perceiue that both Emperours, and other Princes adioyning vnto him, haue rather vsurped of his, then he of theirs. In so much that a good autour doth write that through the Popes negligent looking vnto

it, S. Peters patrimonie is greatly diminished. Yea, perhaps, it is much lesse now at this time, (how great or how lordly soeuer it seeme in your eye,) then it was in the very best times almost thirtéene hundred yeares since. For, to beginne with the donation of Constantine the great, he, (as Eugubinus writeth) resigned to S. Syluester Pope and to his successors the citie of Rome with all his Imperiall roabes, and ornaments, him selfe retyring to Constantinople, where he abode as in his Imperiall seate, as also many other Emperours after him for many yeares togither did, kéeping still either at Constantinople in the east, or els at Milan and Rauenna in the west. And this to be a certaine storie of the gift of Constantine to the Bishops of Rome, besides very many witnesses which here I could cite for proofe therof, as Ammianus Marcellinus a heathen, who was sorie to sée it, Photius Constantinopolitanus, no fauourer of the Pope neither and a Grecian borne, Nicephorus, and many moe besides, as you may reade in the Chronicles: S. Damasus, who liued about the same time, and saw Constantine himselfe, doth write of the said donation and gift of the Emperour. Which gift moreouer, to put it out of all doubt, was confirmed a hundred yeares after by the Emperour Iustinian, by Arithpert king of the Lombardes, by king Pipine of Fraunce, Charles the great, holy king Lewes, and lastly by Otho the great at a Councell holden at Rauenna, as your owne men in their Centuries doo graunt and confesse. For although they say withall that this encrease of wealth in the Church of Rome began after S. Gregories time; yet are they notably disproued by S. Gregorie himselfe, in whose reigne, (as it may probably be thought,) the Churches possessions were more then they be now at this present. And this appeereth by sundry of his epistles, where he maketh expresse mention of S. Peters patrimonie in Africke, in Naples, in Campania, in Dalmatia, in Fraunce, in Italie, in Sicilia, in Sardinia, and in many other countries. Now then whereas for this which is the greatest part, so good proofes may be made: there is no doubt but for sundry other very great and large giftes of diuers Princes, many Nobles, men and women, which were bestowed vpon that Sée, the Bishops thereof can shew very good euidence when nede shall require. Marry, if any of all the Bishops that euer were in that seat, flowing thus in wealth, abused the same to any euill

purpose, or els their authoritie when they were become so mightie, in any of the pointes which are mentioned by you: I am so farre off from iustifying them therein, that rather I r

                           sion to treate more particularly in the chapters folowing. Onely this is it which I go about to proue and defend in them, that because of Christes promise, of building his Church vpon that rocke; and prayer also that their faith should not faile, they neuer erred in iudgement or definitiue sentence. And thus much I am sure the very same autours, whose names here you bring in against me, do mainteine no lesse then I doo, howsoeuer they carpe and finde fault with the Popes naughtie maners. Wherefore to drawe to an ende, whether all that hath béene said hithertoo, or shall be said hereafter touching the practise of the Popes supremacie doo proue his supreme authoritie or not: I referre the iudgement thereof M. Rainoldes, to your selfe, and to euery indifferent reader. Certes I haue endeuored somewhat to doo it, though nothing so wel, I graunt, as such a cause requireth. But as I said you shall sée it proued yet furthermore by the practise thereof which the Bishop of Rome hath alwaies vsed, bearing himselfe as supreme pastour of our soules next vnder Christ: which thing was neuer denyed him but graunted of all men without resistance. Let their spéeches, and déedes bee a iustifying of him: and let their behauiour generally towardes him bée an instruction for vs to folow them in their well dooing.

erred in office, yea, in the supremacie which he hath vsurped ouer both the states spirituall and temporall: you, for the first point of his dominion temporall, doo go about to cléere him by sophismes, and lyes; for the next of his tyrannie in spiritual things, you smooth it, as a lawfull autoritie abused; for the last of his erring in office, you abbridge it to iudgement and definitiue sentence; and wrappe his supremacie vp in generall wordes as allowed by all men, when in the particular pointes of the supremacie you can not iustifie it by any.

The fautes of your dealing for the maintaining of your errour, I will set before you: if perhaps the Lorde will open your eyes, and vntye your tongue, that you may at length perceiue and confesse the Popes supremacie to be vnlawfull. To begin therefore with the first point wherein you séeke to cléere him from hauing vsurped his temporall dominion▪ you say, that if we weigh thinges with indifferencie, and in equall balance, I shall wel perceiue that both Emperours and other Princes adioyning vnto him haue rather vsurped of his, then hee of theirs. Which, if you tooke not thinges at hucksters handes without all weighing of them, you would neuer say. For, that which I haue laide in one scale of the balance, is the manifest truth of recordes, & euidences, approued by the witnesse of writers verie credible, who note the times, the persons, the meanes, and all circumstances how the Pope vsurped. And that which you lay in the other scale, to ouerweigh mine, is partlie impertinent, and nothing to the purpose: partlie vntrue, and impudentlie forged. The weightiest parcel of it, is that which cometh formost, namely, that a good autour doth write, that S. Peters patrimonie is greatly diminished through the Popes negligent looking vnto it. What is that good autour (M. Hart) who writeth so? Why doo you not name him? Is it because you feare that I should finde he maketh nought for you, if I knew him? or that you would put me to the paines of séeking him? I pray vse hereafter at least so much plainenesse, to name me the autours, on which your proofes are grounded: sith I not onely name them, but quote their places also whereon I ground mine, that you

may the better sift them, and iudge of them. The autour, who writeth that which you alleage, is

Peters patrimony) were diminished then by the successours negligence? Might not the predecessours therefore haue vsurped it of ye Emperours long before that time? How much more probably might I alleage Clemangis for proofe of the contrarie: in as much

But because I loue not to build so strong conclusions vpon so weake premisses: it sufficeth me that the good autour, on whom you build yours, dischargeth not the Popes from hauing got their temporall dominion by treason. For, it foloweth not that none of them were traitours eight hundred yeares ago, because before these ninescore yeares some were negligent: no more, then that the father was not an vsurer, because the sonne is a bankerout. Wherefore, the weightiest parcell of that which you lay in for the Popes patrimonie, is as light as a feather. The next, is somewhat lighter. For you say, that perhaps it is much lesser now at this time, then it was in the very best times almost thirteene hundred yeares since: perhaps, it is much lesser. Now, without perhaps, you presume much of some want in vs, if you thinke that a dout

                  ull and vncertaine gesse may winne vs from a certaine and vndouted truth.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, you mistake my meaning, if you take my [perhaps] so. For, that worde is vsed oftentimes of modestie, when men doo not dout of that which they say. Neither doo I of this: as you may perceiue by my proofes of it.

                   it of suttlety rather then of modesty: that if his proofes failed, yet they might finde fauour because they came in with perhaps. Which helpe you shall perceiue that the proofes also of your [perhaps] here doo stand in néede off, if you weigh them with indifferencie. The donation of Constantine beareth the bell amongst them. For he (you say) resigned to S. Siluester Pope

and to his successours the citie of Rome, with all his Imperiall roabes and ornaments, retiring himselfe to Constantinople, where he abode as in his imperiall seate, as also many other Emperours after him for many yeares together did, keeping still either at Constantinople in the East, or els at Milan & Rauenna in the West. And how do you proue that Constantine did so? Forsooth Eugubinus writeth it, you say; & proofe is made of it by very many witnesses, as namely by Ammianus Marcellinus a heathen, who was sorie to see it; by Photius Constantinopolitanus, no fauourer of the the Pope neither, and a Grecian borne; by Nicephorus; yea by S. Damasus, who liued about the same time, and saw Constantine him selfe; yea by our owne men, who graunt in their Centuries that the said donation of Constantine was confirmed a hundred yeares after by the Emperour Iustinian, by Arithpert king of the Lombards, by king Pipine of France, Charles the great, holy king Lewes, and lastly by Otho the great at a Councell holden at Rauenna. So: your witnesses then for Constantines donation are Eugubinus, Ammianus, Photius, Nicephorus, Damasus, and our Centuries. Are these all? No. For you adde that there are many mo besides, as I may reade in the Chronicles. In the Chronicles? In what Chronicles? You meane in the Chronicles writen by Genebrard; whom in this whole point of the Popes temporall dominion you folow. Alas, M. Hart, giue not your selfe ouer so to be abused by that shamelesse man: who maketh no conscience of dealing most lewdly with all sortes of autours, to flatter those ambitious vsurpers of Rome, and vphold their vilanie.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, you are abused, or rather do abuse that worthie painefull man, who seeketh nothing but the maintenance of the catholike faith. But it yrketh you that he hath disclosed the lyes, staines, and fraudes of the Centurie-writers: against whom his Chronicles are specially writen.

               Whether I abuse him, or he you, neither you onely but all sortes of autours: the tryall is easie. You say that the donation of Constantine is proued by them whom you named, and many mo besides, as I may reade in the Chronicles. The many mo besides, whom I reade alleaged in your Chronicle-writer, are Zosimus, Nauclerus, S. Isidore, S. Ierom, Gratian,

Iuo, Picernus, and the Iewes, Rabbi Abraham, and Aben Ezra. Do you rehearse his wordes, wherein he alleageth both these and the rest whom your selfe named: and as you shall finde him to deale in this point with all sortes of autours, so speake of him hereafter, and credit him in others.

                   His words (touching Constantines donation, and the witnesses by whom he proueth it) are these, if you will haue them. Constantine the Emperour did giue Rome and all the Imperiall roabes and ornaments to S. Syluester Pope, and to his successors, as Eugubinus proueth manifestly in two bookes, and Photius the Greeke Patriarke in his Nomocanon, the eighth title, the first chapter.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Well. Eugubinus and Photius do proue it. But doo they proue that which Genebrard defendeth?
            
            
               Hart.
               What els? For he defendeth the donation of Constantine.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But defendeth he the greater donation of Constantine, or the lesser?

               The greater or the lesser? What meane you by that?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               There are two donations of Constantine mentioned in the Canon law: the one in 
                     Distinct. 96. c. Constantinus.
                   the decrees, wherein it is said that he gaue the Pope both his palace, and the citie of Rome, and all the prouinces, places, and cities of Italie, or the westerne countries: the other in 
                     c. Fundamen

                        a. de elect. in Sext.
                   the decretals, wherein no more is said but that he gaue the citie of Rome. This I call the lesser donation of Constantine, which giueth Rome onely: the other, the greater, which giueth Italie also with the countries of the west. And whether of them is it, that Genebrard defendeth?
            
            
               Hart.
               Whether of them, say you? Or what skilleth that?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               It skylleth very much. For the lesser seemeth somewhat to discredit the report of the greater: as it is obserued by one of the best witnesses that Genebrard hath, I meane 
                     Chronograph. volum. 2. generat. 11. 
                  Nauclerus. Who, hauing shewed, that Constantine left Italie and other kingdomes of the west to his sonnes by testament, and therefore it is likely that the decree which saith he gaue

them to the Pope 
                  
                     Paleam esse, & nihil probare.
                   
                  is chaffe (as the lawiers call it) and proueth nothing: whereto (saith he) the decretall maketh not a little, which treating of Constantines donation speaketh onely of the donation of the citie of Rome, making no mention of Italie and other prouinces. But whether this report of the lesser in the decretals discredit the greater in the decrees, or no: the greater is so brainlesse in the eyes of all men that haue sense and reason, that not your historians onely doo nippe it, as

               Thinke? Nay you may be sure that he meant not. For in the same place, vpon the wordes that you rehearsed, I (saith he) haue alwaies denied this consequence:

So that in Genebrards iudgement Pope Syluester and his successors haue gotten a great deale more by other meanes, then by Constantines donation. But they haue not gotten more then the greater donation of Constantine in the decrees doth giue them. For it doth giue them all the prouinces, places, and cities of Italie, and other countries of the west. In Genebrards iudgement therefore the greater donation of Constantine is forged: and that which he defendeth must be the lesser onely.

               But the next writer whom he alleageth, namely Zosimus, is fitter for his purpose: as speaking of the lesser donation precisely. For

                  Constantine (saith he) departed out of Rome, and remoued thence the maiestie of the Empire▪ to Constantinople, because he knewe himselfe to be misliked of the Romans for altering of religion.

               Hart.
               As Genebrard concludeth of it. For

                  he departed: to whom? Not to the Senate, not to the people: for that hath no man writen. Neither did the Senate or people euer claime it. To the Pope therefore: who sith that time possesseth and keepeth it as his owne; hath olde recordes, and euidences, and reuenues of it.

               The wit of a Sophister. As if a man should say: king Henrie departed from the citie of London vnto Windsore castle, and remoued the Court thither. He departed: to whom? Not to the Aldermen, not to the Citizens: for no man saith so. Neither did the Aldermen or Citizens euer claime it. To the Bishop therefore: who sith that time possesseth and kéepeth it as his owne; hath old recordes, and euidences, and reuenues of it.

               Nay, that is a lye, that the Bishop of London possesseth the citie as his own sith that time.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Euen so is the other. For the Emperours possessed Rome foure hundred yeares after the time that Constantine departed to Constantinople: as your own

               Hart.
               The Popes enioyed not a while the full power: yet had they right vnto it. Howbeit Ammianus Marcellinus sheweth they had the power too: as Genebrard declareth after. But first he confirmeth their right out of S. Damasus.

               Hart.
               
                  S. Damasus, who saw Constantine, hath writen of that donation: as euen the Centurie-writers affirme in the seuenth chapter of the fourth Centurie.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Two lyes, with one breath. For neither hath Damasus writen of it: nor doo the Centurie-writers affirme that he hath. Nay they affirme the contrarie. For, in 
                     Centur. 4. cap. 7. tit. de Primatu.
                   the very place that Genebrard alleageth, they say, that neither historians haue made mention of it, such as are Eusebius, Eutropius, Rufinus, Socrates, Theodoret, Euagrius, Paulus▪ Diaconus, Beda, Orosius, Zonaras, Nicephorus, and the like: nor they who wrote the liues of Emperours, or of Popes, as Ierom and Damasus, though yet he speaketh somewhat of thinges giuen by Constantine: nor other famous Doctors whose monuments are extant, as Athanasius, Basil, Ambrose, Optatus, Gregorie Nyssen, Gregorie Nazianzene, Austin, and Chrysostome: nor the Popes themselues when they were to proue their supremacie in Councels did speake a word of that donation, which they would then haue cast forth, as shipmen do the sacred ancre in great perill.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               The wordes are not so flatt and perfite in the Latin, as

you doo english them. For, vpon the name of Damasus, it foloweth: qui etsi quaedam de donis Constantini dicit, tamen alij insignes eccl

               But if you reade it so: the clause ensuing is vnperfit, and hath no sense at all. A very manifest token that somewhat is a misse, through either the writers, or printers, or correctours faute. And that is [qui] mistaken (as I gesse) for [neque,] and put out of his place: where it ought to folow vpon the name of Damasus, etsi quaedam de donis Constantini dicit tamen; neque alij insignes ecclesiarum doctores- But howsoeuer the words are to be amended: the sense must néedes be as I saide touching Damasus. For the sentence is plaine so farre, that neither Ierom nor Damasus haue mentioned that donation of Constantine: as plaine, as that which foloweth, that it is not mentioned by other famous Doctors neither. And who can imagin that the Centurie-writers should say that Damasus wrote of it: when it is so cléere that he wrote not, that your

                  Ammianus Marcellinus, an heathen, doth closely signifie some such thing, while he complaineth and grudgeth at the Popes wealth and power: in the seuen and twentieth booke of his story.

Which tumult Viuentius (who was the Lord Deputie) being neither able to pacify, nor to redresse, was forced through their outrage to withdraw himselfe out of the citie into the suburbes: and Damasus through the valiant behauiour of his faction got the conquest in the fray. And it is certaine that in the Church of

Sicininus (where Christians make their assemblie) there were found

Behold, this is the wealth and power of the Pope which Ammianus Marcellinus complayneth off and grudgeth at. Some such thing it is as Constantine donation: but it is not it. For the wealth, is the pompe and brauery that they maintained by the offrings of matrones. The power, is a faction of cutters, so desperate, that when they slew aboue a hundred in a fray, the Lord Deputie could not helpe it. But the verie naming of the Lord Deputie (sent thither by ye Emperour) should haue taught Genebrard that the Emperour kept the citie still as his owne, and was the soueraine Lorde of it. Wherefore that which he findeth in Ammianus Marcellinus touching the Popes wealth and power, is in respect of wealth, the donation of matrones; in respect of power, the donation of cutters; but in respect of neither the donation of Constantine.

               Nay, in that (I thinke) you are deceiued greatly, that you say the Emperour kept still the citie as his owne because he sent a Deputie thither. For that Deputie or Lieutenant was there to kéepe the citie, not for the Emperours vse, but for his safegarde onely.

               I: least the Pope growing dayly mightier by reason of wealth, and bordering vpon him, should encroch on somewhat of his vpon occasion. As Princes now adayes are wont to

haue their Deputies and Lieutenants resident in cities néere their territories for their owne safegard, and not to keepe the cities as theirs, which are not theirs.

               Embassadours or Agents perhaps they may haue in realmes or cities néere them. But that the French king should haue a Lieutenant or Deputie in London, or that ye Quéene of Englands Deputy in Ireland should kéepe it not for her vse, but for her safegard onely: Princes now a dayes (I hope) vse not that; sure the Emperours did not. For they had their Lieutenants in ye citie of Rome, not as Agents, but as Regents; and their Lieutenants kept it both to their safegard, and their vse: as

               A proofe of some weight, if all this be true that the Centurie-writers report, yea and report it vsing these verie wordes, that Iustinian the Emperour confirmed that donation a hundred yeares after, and Arithpert, Pipine, Charles, Lewes, and Otho. But what if these be not the verie wordes in which the Centurie-writers doo report it? What if the Centurie-writers
                  
doo not report it at all? As in déed they doo not. For these are 
                     Centur. 10. cap. 10. pag. 538 their wordes: Pope Leo the eighth to shew his thankfullnes to the Emperour (by whom hee had the Popedom) restored to the Empire the things which either Constantine or Charles gaue vnto the Church, or Iustinian confirmed before him, or Arithpert the Lombard king bestowed on it. Now we haue set doune before out of Krantzius in the tenth chapter of the fourth booke of his storie of Saxonie the copie of the letters by which Leo restored them. Thus farre the Centurie-writers. Wherein, first, they speake not of Constantines donation either the greater or the lesser, but in generall onely of thinges that he gaue. Which might be other thinges, and not the citie of Rome. Secondly, they say not, [the thinges which he gaue, and Charles did confirme,] but [the thinges which either he or Charles gaue:] that it might be Charles donation, and not his, for any thing that they say. Thirdly, 
                     Quaevel Constantinus donauit, aut Carolus dedit ecclesiae.
                   their very wordes are the wordes of Krantzius, whom they alleage and 
                     Krantz. Saxon. lib. 4. cap. 10. quote: and Krantzius doth speake them by way of a iest. For neither is Constantine named in the letters in which he saith that thankfulnes is shewed by Pope Leo: and 
                     cap. 11. vpon the letters he frameth a reproofe of Constantines donation. So that, to proue it by those wordes of Krantzius, is, as if the Pharisees should proue their traditions by that spéech of Christ: 
                     Mark. 7.

                  Wel doo ye reiect the commandements of God, that ye may obserue your owne tradition. Fourthly, the Centurie-writers doo not as much as mention either Lewes, or Pipine; neither here, nor 
                     In Iohanne suceessore Leonis octaui.
                   after where they mention Otho. Finally, not one of all that are mentioned is reported by them to haue confirmed that donation. No not Iustinian: of whom the shew is greatest as Genebrard doth cite their wordes, that he confirmed it after a hundred yeares.

possessions of others in actions and suites of law: no lesse then a hundred should holde against the landes and possessions of the Church. Though the Centurie-writers meant by [confirming] the assuring of those thinges that any way came from Iustinian: as appéereth by

                  they report it vsing those very wordes: to perswade the credulous thereby (as hee hath you) that Constantines donation cannot be doubted of ▪ sith it was confirmed by the Emperour Iustinian a hundred yeares after, as our owne men in their Centuries doo graunt.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Perhaps there is some other place in Iustinian, that maketh proofe of it. For while I perused the Tables of that booke of the Authentikes which was lent me to serch out this in: I was thereby directed to a place in Iustinian where Constantines donation is proued most plainely: to weete, in gloss. sing. secundum Bald: in l. 2. §. Cum vrbem. ff. de offic. praefect. vrbis.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               It is not plainely proued there, but barely said; and said, not in the text, but in the glose onely; nor in ye 
                  glose vpon Iustinian, but the Digests; and that without all ground either of any autour of the Digests, or of Iustinian.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               But in the glose vpon Iustinian himselfe, euen in the Authentikes, there is an other place where the same question is handled pro and con: and there although he say that Constantine could make no such donation de iure, yet he denyeth not but that he made it de facto.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  Yet he denyeth not: and 
                     Licet solutio facti ad nos non pertineat, soluimus quod de

                   he affirmeth not; but

leaueth it as he found it. Why do you trifle so with the glose-writer? Who though hee had affirmed the donation of Constantine: doth that proue the point auouched by Genebrard, that Iustinian confirmed it? If I had thought that you would make such account of the wordes of lawiers: I could haue alleaged men skilfuller of antiquities, then all the glose-writers, against that tale of Constantine. For not onely such as

               Hart.
               Yes, I make no doubt but Genebrard is able to bring more for him selfe herein then I haue seene, or can finde in Iustinian.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Neither make I doubt but, if he could haue brought more, his

               Hart.
               But the rest of the writers whom he doth alleage, no doubt he doth alleage them truely; S. Gregorie, S. Isidore, Nauclerus, Photius, Nicephorus, S. Ierom, Iuo, Gratian, Picernus, Rabbi Abraham, and Aben Ezra.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               He doth alleage them truely, I graunt, the most of them. But doo they proue the point for which he doth alleage them?
            
            
               Hart.
               Yea, and that directly: as by his wordes you shall perceiue. S. Gregorie about the sixe hundreth yeare of Christ doth shew in his epistles that the Church had ample landes and possessions, farre and wide through the west. At the which time S. Isidore in his storie (as Nauclerus citeth in the eleuenth age of his Chronicles) Constantine, saith he, did yeelde the citie to the Pope, and the imperiall ornaments, that is to say, the crown,

and the white palfrey on the which he rode. Altogither as Photius of Constantinople, though otherwise an enimie of the See of Rome, auoucheth in his Nomocanon about the yeare eight hundred and sixtie.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Nay: no more of Photius. For it is not he (as I haue shewed) who saith it, but Balsamon who commenteth on him. And Balsamon is later by thrée hundred yeares.
            
            
               Hart.
               Yet he was a Grecian too, and an enimie of the Sée of Rome: and therefore not likely to vouch it, if it were not true.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But Genebrard hath graunted that to be false which he voucheth. For he saith that Constantine did giue to Pope Syluester, the prouinces, and places, and fortresses of al Italie, or of the westerne countries, and not the citie of Rome onely. Neither doth he vouch this in respect of Rome but of Constantinople: which being to enioy the priuileges of Rome

                  Photius rehearseth in his Nomocanon, Now if you will know the priuileges of Rome (saith Balsamon) they are enrolled in the decree of Constantines donation made to Pope Syluester. So that it was for loue to the Patriarkes Sée of Constantinople, not to the Popes of Rome, that hee auoucheth it: that as Rome might therby claime al the West, so Constantinople might get all the East. Wherefore, that circumstance, that Balsamon was an enimie of the See of Rome, doth nothing helpe the credit of Constantines donation. Neither doth S. Isidore make much more for it, as 
                     Chronogr. volum. 2. generat. 11. 
                  Nauclerus citeth him. For, as he citeth him, he giueth him a touch withall to ouerthrow him. There is (saith Nauclerus) no mention of Constantines donation in any autours, but in the booke of decrees: and the Archbishop of Florence, Antoninus, affirmeth in his chronicles, that in ancient bookes of the Decreees it is not neither. Which I greatly maruaile at, sith Isidore reporteth plainely in his storie, that Constantine did yeeld the citie of Rome vnto the Pope, and all the imperiall ornaments, that is to say, the crowne, the apparell, and the white palfrey to ride vpon. Nauclerus therefore citeth Isidore as saying it: but so, as though he thought all were not well in Isidore, sith there is no mention of it in any autours of credit or antiquitie. I shewed you

                  me tokens there of forgerie. At the least, it séemeth that Genebrard himselfe suspected some weakenes in that point of Isidore: and therefore neither citeth him but as out of Nauclerus, and addeth that he wrote at the time that Gregorie did speake much of the Churches landes. For, if I mistake not the policie of Genebrard, he mentioneth the ample landes and possessions which the church had farre and wide through the west in the time of Gregorie: to the intent that men might conceiue thereof that the citie of Rome was part of those lands, sith Isidore, who wrote at the same time, reporteth that it was giuen to the Pope. But this obseruation which he made to strēghthen his autours report, doth most of all weaken it. For neither doth Gregorie name the citie of Rome as part of those landes which in his epistles he sheweth that the church had through the west:

                   of any other Romans. And so the circumstance of Gregories time and testimonie, which Genebrard would strengthen his tale

with, doth weaken it. For neither is the citie of Rome named by Gregorie amongst the Churches landes, as I was about to say: and at the verie time, that Gregorie was Pope, the Emperours held the citie, & gouerned it (as they were wont) by a

                  Nicephorus saith in the seuenth booke, the nine and fourtieth chapter, Constantine did consecrate and giue vnto Christ the palace of Lateran. Which thing S.

               I perceiue it was either a foxe or a ferne-bush that Genebrard espyed.

                   they doo witnesse who haue seene them: neither are we sure by either old or new in which it is extant, that Gratian did put it in. For in ech sort of them, both writen, and printed, it is entitled [palea] that is to say, chaffe: which note (as 
                     Antonius Contius. c. cum enixa. Dist. 5. in Annotat.
                   a learned and famous lawier thinketh) is set to those chapters that were not first inserted into the booke by Gratian, but added after in the margent by Gratians interpreters, as any of them thought good, and in the best and auncientest copies they are omitted wholy for the most part. Now, if in Gratian it crept out of the margent thus into the text: much more is it likely that 
                     Pannom. lib. 4. cap. 1. de priuilegijs Constantini Imperatoris concessis Syluestro Papae.
                   
                  Iuo caught it so too. For if it had béene of auncient time in Iuo when Gratian compiled the booke of decrees: it is not to be thought that Gratian, a man who forgeth autours often and counterfeiteth priuileges for lesse aduantage of the Pope, would haue left him out such a Princely priuilege, if he had found it in an autour.
            
            
               Hart.
               It is an easie matter with shiftes and surmises to discredit autours, as you doo Picernus, Gratian, and Iuo. Or, if it be true that Iuo and Gratian did not themselues record it: yet there is no cause why the Greeke copy translated into Latin by Picernus should be discredited because it was found in the Popes librarie. For there are many rare bookes in the Popes librarie, that are not els where to be found.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But the Greeke text of Constantines donation was els where to be found. For it is in Balsamon translated into Latin also by Gentian Heruet. And this doth discredit the matter so much more: because the Latin charter (or chaffe) that is in Gratian doth differ from the Greeke in many thinges.

For, Rabbi Abraham, in Zikron Dibre Romi, saith that Constantine hauing built Constantinople, went out of Rome, and gaue it to the Priestes of the Idumeans (so they call Christians) to this day. And Aben Ezra vpon the eleuenth chapter of Daniel, on these wordes, And he shall care for no God: the meaning is (saith he) that Constantine did beautifie the place of Rome which was his seate, and l

                  Rabbi Abraham, and Aben Ezra, did liue about the same time that Gratian did, or rather somewat since; when the Pope had gotten fully from the Emperour the soueraintie in Rome. They looked to the state of their owne times; and saw that the citie, which Constantine had, was now possessed by the Pope. Wherefore sith the bruit of Constantines donation was set abroch then: no maruell if they tasted of it: chiefly sith they had so litle skill in stories.

                  Chronicles doo sooth their falshood in it. Beside that, if Constantine had made this pretensed donation in déed: yet cometh it short of that for proofe whereof you cite it, to wéet, that the temporall dominion of the Popes is much lesse now, then it was almost thirteene hundred yeares since. For, the citie of Rome, which in this donation is saide to haue béene giuen them, is but a litle corner of their dominion now.
            
            
               Hart.
               But if you ioyne thereto that which I added of S. Peters patrimonie belonging vnto them within two or thrée hundred yeares after Constantine: it cometh home to the proofe of that which I purposed; at least, to the disproofe of that which your men auouch in their Centuries. For although they say that this encrease of wealth in the Church of Rome began after S. Gregories time: yet are they notably disproued by S. Gregorie himselfe, in whose reigne, (as it may probably be thought,) the Churches possessions were more then they bée now at this present. And this appeareth by sundrie of his epistles, where hee maketh expresse mention of S. Peters patrimonie in Africke, in Naples, in Campania, in Dalmatia, in Fraunce, in Italie, in Sicilia, in Sardinia, and in many other countries.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               You haue heard, M. Hart, of sir Thomas More: and perhaps you haue read the historie writen by him of king Richard the third.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               A worthie worke of a worthieman. Who, if he had gone through in like sorte with all our English historie, we might compare with Greekes or Romans. But what of that historie?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               In it he reporteth, that Richard was a tyrant, and did vsurpe the regall dignitie vpon him selfe, defrauding Prince Edward whose it was by right. Doth sir Thomas More say true in this of Richard, or doth he misreport him?
            
            
               Hart.
               True, out of question: as it is apparant by all our historians, who consent therein.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Yet there is a writer who saith that king Richard did not vsurpe the crowne. And for proofe thereof, hee bringeth forth sundrie old recordes and euidences of the house of Yorke: by which it is shewed that Richard had landes in Calice, in Canterburie, in Kent, in Northumberland, in Ireland, in England, in Garnsey and in Iersey, before Prince Edwardes time wherein 
                     •
                  ir Thomas More reporteth him to haue vsurped.
            
            
               
               Hart.
               He might haue those landes, while he was Duke of Glocester, and not king of England. Wherefore, the writer who bringeth this to proue that he vsurped not the crowne, disproueth not the historie of Sir Thomas More, but bewrayeth his owne frowardnesse or follie.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               You are the writer, M. Hart. I shewed by the historie of Sigonius, and others, most worthie of credit, that the Popes vsurped Rome, and the dominion of the Roman Dukedom, defrauding the Emperour of his right by treason. You affirme the contrarie. And for proofe thereof you alleage sundrie epistles of S. Gregorie, whereby it appeareth that they had possessions in Afrike, in Naples, in Campania, in Dalmatia, in Fraunce, in Italie, in Sicilia, and in Sardinia, before the time wherein Sigonius declareth them to haue vsurped. But, as your selfe answered, they might haue these possessions while they were Bishops, and not Princes. Wherefore in bringing this to proue that they vsurped not the Princedome (so to terme it) and temporall dominion of the Papall State: you disproue not the historie of Sigonius, and the rest, but bewray your owne frowardnesse or follie. Nay you bewray greater fautes of euil & guilful dealing, as you h

                  oue the Popes vsurping, are of y• Popes religion, & therefore of greater credit against the Popes: you say nought to them, but name in their steed our autors of the Centuries. Euen as if the writer (whom I told you of) being vrged with the credit of sir Thomas More and English historians, should answere that although Funccius, a German, report in his Chronicle that Richard did vsurpe, yet is he notably disproued by the euidences of the house of Yorke. Againe, where your conclusion ought to be resolute that ye Churches poss

                  ssions were more in S. Gregories time, then they be now: you say they were more, as it may probably be thought. To ouerbeare veritie with probabilitie; the truth, with likelihood of truth: and leaue your selfe a lurking hole, that, although the thing be found to be false, yet you may escape who vouch it not as true, but probable. Moreouer, the time of Gregories being Bishop, you terme it his reigne: thereby to bréede opinion that he had the temporall dominion, as they haue now. Wherein that worde is vsed so much the more deceitfully: because it prepareth a way to the mistaking of that

which you alleage out of Gregories epistles touching S. Peters patrimonie. For. S. Peters patrimonie doth signifie the temporall dominion of the Popes, in that of 
                     De corrupt. eccles. stat. cap. 4 
                  Clemangis, which you began your answere with. And so by this [reigne] a man would take it here. Whereas Gregorie meaneth the landes of the Church and Bishopricke of Rome by S. Peters patrimonie; not the dominion temporall, which they had not then. But in these fautes you are the more excusable, because you doo folow the footsteps of Genebrard: whose

                  sophistrie might bring you to them vnawares. In the next your shame can no way be couered. For whereas your lodesman, hauing searched Gregories epistles of purpose for S. Peters patrimonie, could finde it in no more places but in those which you rehearsed by name: you thinking such flyes too small for the Pope, doo adde (with flat vntruth) and many other countries: beside that [other countries] is brought in so too, as if Campania, Naples, and Italie, were sundry count

                     ies, where Naples is a towne, Campania a shire of Italie. And yet as though your dealing were sincere and sound, you knit it vp thus, that seeing for this which is the greatest part, so good proofes may be made: no doubt but the Popes can shew verie good euidence when neede shal require for sundry other verie great and large giftes which were bestowed vpon their See, by diuers Princes, many Nobles, men, and women. The question is of the temporall dominion of the Popes. The proofe you bring thereof from Constantine, is forged; from Gregorie, is fond. So that no part is proued yet, much lesse the greatest. The chiefest of the rest that Popes can shew for it, is Pipines donation, and the successours of Pipine. In it I haue conuinced them also of vsurping: who first did begge and take the territories, and ditions, which should haue béene restored to their old Lord the Emperour; and afterwarde did vse their n

                  Genebrard hath other reasons to defend the right of the Pope, if these doo not content men. For I (saith he) answere to heretikes impugning the donation of Constantine that which Iephte did (in the eleuenth of Iudges) to the king of Ammonites requiring the land of Galaad to bee restored him: we will possesse that which the Lord our God hath conquered and obteined. Vnlesse perhaps thou canst shew that any man did striue about it for the space of three hundred yeares: (

                  here for a thousand yeares and more.) Why so long time haue you attempted nothing for the recouerie of it? Chiefly, sith the prescription of certaine yeares sufficeth in groundes and possessions. Moreouer, the consent of Italie, and of the Church, and of the whole world is of force enough to giue the Pope that right. Finally, that Constantine remoued the seat of the earthly Empire to Constantinople through Gods speciall prouidence, to the end that the kingdome of the Church forespoken of by Daniel the Prophet might haue his seate at Rome, it appeareth by this, that straight the westerne Emperours, Constans and the rest, who folowed for certaine ages,

                  left Rome still, and placed the seate of the westerne Empire at Milan or Rauenna; and also that Constantius the nephiew of Heraclius, Michael, and certaine others would haue brought it in againe to Rome, but could not. Wherefore howsoeuer the Popes dominion temporall began, or whensoeuer: it is sure that he hath right vnto it now.

               The point that we reason of, is not (M. Hart) what right he hath now, but what wrong heretofore hee hath doone the Emperour to obteine this right. Though neither can you proue his right by these reasons. For, that which

                  the kingdome of the Saintes that doth endure for euer. And, if we presume vpon the secret workes of the prouidence of God to gather what the fansie of man doth imagin, not what the wisedom of God hath reuealed: the Turkish impietie may bee as well proued as the Papall kingdom; because as the seate of the westerne Empire is fallen to the Pope, so Constantinople, the seat of the Easterne, is

fallen to the Turke. But whatsoeuer right these reasons may afforde to the Pope now: they acquite him not from hauing doon wrong to the Emperours heretofore, in that he got his temporall dominion from them by treason and rebellion. And this is the first point, wherein you went about to cléere his supremacie. The next, is his tyrannie in spirituall things. Wherein your defense of him is so tempered, that although you cannot choose but acknowledge his faute in those excesses which I laide open: yet doo you smooth them as abuses onely of lawfull autoritie, and not vnlawfull actes of vsurped power. For you say, that if any of the Bishops of Rome abused their wealth to any euill purpose, or els their autoritie, in any of the pointes mentioned by me: you are so farre off from iustifying them therein, that rather you rew to see it, and you condemne them therefore. A short and sclender answere to all their crimes that I touched. Howbeit, if you speake vnfainedly, M. Hart, as I pray God you doo: I am glad that you seeke not to iustifie the Popes in any of the pointes that I charged them with, but rew and condemne their abuses therein. For I laide to their charge that they haue oppressed both the ciuil state and the ecclesiasticall: the ciuil, in taking vpon them to giue Empires, to depose Princes, to discharge subiectes of their allegiance and oth; the ecclesiasticall, in making of Church-officers, ordering of Church-causes, disposing of Church-goodes, executing of Church-censures, and establishing of Church-lawes, to serue their owne desires and lustes. In all the which pointes if you condemne their doinges as abuses of their autoritie: you condemne the practise of their whole supremacie as nothing els in grosse but an heape of abuses.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Not of their whole supremacie. For though some of them abused their autoritie in sundrie pointes which you mentioned: yet others haue not doon so. As we had experience in Quéene Maries dayes: wherein there were not so many Church-liuings bestowed in England vpon Italian Pastors, as you spake of vnder Gregorie the ninth, or Innocentius the fourth. But howsoeuer they dealt with practise of their power, which they abused I graunt: the power it selfe must not be therfore thought vnlawfull; nor was it vsurped because it was abused. For Princes abuse their power oftentimes in oppressing

their subiectes. Yet, you will not say that they vsurpe their Princely power.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Neither doo I say that the Pope vsurpeth his Bishoply power, but the supremacie. The vsurping whereof you go about to hide with the mist of abusing; while you distinguish not betwéene a lawfull power vsed vnlawfully, and an vnlawfull power. King Edward the fourth did put to death Burdet (a marchant of London) for saying merily to his sonne, that he would make him inheritour of the crowne: misconstruing his wordes, as though he had meant the crowne of the realme; where he meant his house at the signe of the crowne. Herein the king abused his power, and not vsurped it: because God had giuen him the sworde to execute iustice and iudgement on his subiect; though he vsed it vnlawfully against an innocent. But if he had executed a subiect of the Spanish kinges, or had excommunicated his owne, yea deseruing it; this were an vsurped not an abused power: because he did not beare the sworde ouer Spaine; and the Church-censures belong to the Bishops charge, not to the Princes. In like sorte the Pope of Rome might remoue the Roman Emperour from the communion: as

                  Ambrose Bishop of Milan remoued Theodosius, being of his charge in the Church of Milan. Which if the Pope did vnlawfully, and not as Ambrose: he abused his power. But if he presumed to excommunicate other kings, or to depose the Roman Emperour: the power that he practised therein was vnlawfull, and he vsurped it. Which example of his dealing with the ciuill state, obserueth the tenour of the same disorder in the ecclesiasticall. For if he 1. Tim. 5.22. laide handes rashly vpon a man whom he had right to ordeine: his power was lawfull, though abused. But if he tooke vpon him the right of making Pastors, or of giuing benefices and Bishoprickes through all the world: hee did vsurpe vnlawfull power. Wherefore sith the tyranny wherewith I charged him in spirituall things was of the supremacie ouer all Christendome, not of Bishoply power ouer his owne diocese: the power of spiritual rule which he practised ouer both the states ecclesiasticall and ciuill, is not abused, but vsurped. Neither can you salue it with laying the blame on some of the predecessours: as if the successours now were guiltlesse of it. For, though they doo not all commit the same excesse in the execution

of their vsurped power: yet they all maintaine the libertie of dooing it, and doo it when they list. As since Quéene Maries dayes one of your best Popes, Pius the fifth, hath shewed:

Hart, and your autours iudgement should moue you to confesse their supremacie in spirituall thinges to be vsurped, no lesse, then I haue shewed it to be in temporall. But if perhaps you will not graunt so much yet, suspending your sentence till the chapters folowing, whereto you referre vs: the third and last point, that they erred in office, is proued notwithstanding euen by that you graunt. And therefore you say that onely this is it which you goe about to defend in them, that because of Christes promise, of building his church vpon that rocke; and prayer also that their faith should not faile; they neuer erred in iudgement, or definitiue sentence. Wherein, being driuen by force of euident truth from your maine distinction, that the Pope may erre in person, not in office; as a priuat man, not as Pope: you retire from all the wards of your castle into the celler as it were, and say that in a corner of his office he neuer erred; but otherwise in office and euery part thereof he hath.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, this was my meaning by that distinction at the first. As you may perceiue by that In the 3. Diuis. of this chapter.
                   I spake expresly of definitiue sentence: and saide, that he cannot erre iudicially.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then your meaning was to put the coate of Hercules vpon a dwarfes bodie. For the Popes office is a great deale larger then iudgement or definitiue sentence. And when you saide withall that the Euangelistes, and other penners of holy write, for the execution of that function had the assistance of God, and so farre could not erre possibly: you séemed to insinuate that the Popes haue likewise the assistance of God for the execution of their function; and can no more erre in discharging of it, then could the Euangelists in writing of the

Gospell. But sith you sée now that in function and office they may be as false, as the Gospell is true; which in euery parte thereof I haue proued: you shall sée as much in this remnant also of iudgement & definitiue sentence, vnlesse you shut your eies against ye light of manifest proofe. For what doo you meane by saying that the promise and prayer of Christ kéepeth them from erring in iudgement or definitiue sentence? Doo you not meane that they cannot teach against the truth in a matter of faith, because the Church of Christ shalbe built vpon them, & their faith shall not faile, that they may strengthen their brethren.
            
            
               Hart.
               I meane (as I declared) that they cannot nor shal not euer iudicially conclude or giue definitiue sentence for falshood or heresie against the Catholike faith, in their Consistories, Courtes, Councels, decrées, deliberations, or consultations kept for decision and determination of such controuersies, doutes, or questions of faith as shall bee proposed vnto them: because Christes prayer and promise protecteth them therein for confirmation of their brethren.

               The issue of our conference shall trye that they haue erred thus in euery point of the Catholike faith, wherein they teach against vs: as euen in this first of their owne supremacie. But I will shew presently that they haue doone it in such things as your selues confesse to be doctrines of falshood or heresie. And that will I shew by the same autours (or as good as them) of whom you vouch so boldly, that you are sure they doo maintaine this, of the Popes not erring in iudgement or definitiue sentence, no lesse then you do.

The humour of Sergius, which Stephen serued in it, (as being set vp by his faction) occasioned be like the name to be mistaken. mistaking his name, yet iudging of the thing rightly. For after the rehersall thereof, that depriuing all them of their degree who were ordeined by Formosus, he did ordeine them againe: which thing (saith Luitprandus) how wickedly he did you may perceue by this, that euen they who receyued grace or Apostolike blessing of Iudas the betrayer of Christ before he betrayed him, were not depriued of it after he had betrayed him and hanged himselfe. For the blessing which is bestowed on the seruants of Christ, is not powred on them by that Priest which is seene, but by that Priest which is not seene. For neither he that planteth is any thing nor he that watereth, but God that giueth the encrease. So manifestly caried the fact of Pope Stephen a sauour of Donatisme, that is, of a notorious errour in faith: though he had not approued it by his decrée. Much more sith he decréed the thing as true and lawfull.

               To say that holy orders giuen by a Bishop, be he neuer so wicked, are voide, and of no force: it is an errour in faith, I graunt. But this of Luitprandus is denyed by

But whether he ordeined them againe or no: hee decréed that which your selues acknowledge to be an errour in faith; & he decréed it in a Councell.

               But the Councell did not approue that decrée by frée voyce & iudgement. The Pope did extort their consent through feare:

You bear vs in hand that the Pope is a lyon, and other men are hartes. But you make him the hart (me thinkes) & them lyons, when you say that himselfe may erre and faile in faith, but he can not doo it in Consistories, Courtes & Councels. As if Christ had prayed for his brethren to strengthen him, and not for him to strengthen his brethren.

               Nay, I made not mention of his brethren so, as if the assurance of truth in his decrees did depend of them. For, though it behooue him to vse their aduise, and therefore I spake of Consistories, Courtes, and Councels: yet, whether he folow their aduise or no, his decrées are true. But as for Pope Stephen, I can not thinke that he decréed that errour. At least, if he decreed it, yet he set not foorth a decrée of it, as to teach the Church.

               But if he decréed it, he erred in iudgement and definitiue sentence: which is the point that you denyed. Howbeit to driue you from this shelter also: Pope Caelestine the third

                     Chapt. 2. Diuis. 1. alreadie proued, that the word petra, which you translate a rocke, doth signifie in Christes spéech, a stone, not a rocke. Howbeit rocke, or stone, it mak
                     •
                  th no difference to the sayings of the Fathers, which you alleage, concerning it. For whether they meant a stone, as it is properly; or a rocke, as it may be they did, (at least S. 
                  Who applyeth the rocke to Christ: De verbis Domin. Serm. 13. Retractat. lib. 1.

                  ▪) through doutfulnesse of the worde: they meant not to build the Papacie therby. Wherfore if you thinke that the name of stone either hath not so great aduantage for your purpose, or doth not yéelde so fully the meaning of the Fathers: I am content (with out preiudice to that which I haue spokē touching the right sense thereof in Christes spéech) to vse your rocke in steede of it.
            
            
               Hart.
               So you must doo, if you will deale with my argument. For the maiestie of the Church of Rome is much aduanced by the name of the rocke: and in my iudgement the Fathers meant no lesse when they applyed ye words of Christ to that Sée.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The Fathers vsed those wordes to aduance the maiestie of the Church of Rome: but neither to aduance the church of Rome alone, neither to import the Popes supremacie by that maiestie. And this may be gathered plainely by S.

                  le of honour & preeminence to the Church of Rome: yet doth he apply that of the rock
                  
to the Church in general. For he affirmeth that our Lord tooke order for the office of a Bishop and the state of his Church by saying vnto Peter, Thou art Peter, and on this rocke will I build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it: and, to thee will I giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt binde on earth shall be bound in heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heauen. Thence by course of times, and successions, there floweth

                  vpon the Bishops the Church should be set, and euery action of the Church should be gouerned and guided by the same rulers. In the which wordes S. Cyprian (you see) accounteth all Bishops the rocke of the Church. That as by the church built vpon the rocke, the whole Church is meant, and not the Church of Rome, or of Carthage onely: so neither the Bishop of Rome, nor of Carthage, may be represented alone by the rocke, and yet as well the Bishop of Carthage as of Rome.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Howsoeuer it seemed in S. Cyprians iudgement to belong to all Bishops, and so after a sort to the Bishop of Carthage, as 
                     Epist. 27. a

                   he applyeth it: yet other of the Fathers apply it in speciall to the Bishop of Rome, & giue it particularly to that Church, & Sée.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               They doo: but in such sort, that they might haue done it to any faithfull Church, euen to the Church of Carthage, as S. Cyprian did. For that which is verified of a thing in generall, is verified in the speciall. As, for example, the Catholike Church in generall is named 
                     Heb. 10: 21. 
                  the house of God, and 
                     Cant. 4.12. 
                  the spouse of Christ. The Apostle applyeth those titles in special, 
                     Heb. 3.6. the one to the Hebrewes, 
                  2. Cor. 11.2. the other to the Corinthians, if they continue faithfull. And so what Christ hath said of his whole Church, that the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it: that is true in euery part of his Church. And if he named Peter, a rocke, (in respect of the faith that hee professed,) on the which he said he would build his Church; then al, on whom (professing the same faith of Christ) his Church in part is builded, may, in a proportion, be called rockes also. Wherefore sith the Fathers did speake of the Church of Rome when it was holy, and of the Roman Bishops, when they professed the faith of Peter: no maruaile, if they said the Church was built on that rocke, and the gates of hell did not preuaile against it. Howbeit I deny not but that in their spéeches of the Church of Rome
                  
they giue more vnto it then they could haue giuen to euery faithfull Church. For whereas of the sundry Churches of Christ some were planted by the Apostles them selues, as

               If you list: but the feast of S. Peters chaire would proue it more galantly. For if the testimonies, which you alleage, of Ierom and Austin, be examined: they say nothing for it. S. Ierom abiding (in his young yeares) among the Arian heretikes in the coastes of Syria, was required by their Bishop to allow and approue a profession of faith touching the Trinitie, wherein he suspected there lay some priuy poyson hidden. Wherefore least he should yéelde thereunto rashly, he sought to be directed by the aduise and counsell of Damasus Bishop of Rome: as whom both hee acknowledged to bee his owne Bi

                  hop, and knew to be a Bishop that helde the catholike faith; which praise by that title of the rocke he giueth him. In Afrike, they were troubled with other heretikes named Donatistes: a sect which despised the communion of Saintes, and rent them selues a sunder from the assemblies of Christians, because there were some euil men amongst them (as they said) whose felowship defiled them. S. Austin wrote a Psalme for the Catholiks against these: wherein, hauing proued first out of the scriptures, that we must not leaue the communion of the Church for that there are some euill men in it, sith Christ hath declared that there should be so, as tares with corne, in the field; as chaffe with wheate in the floore; as badde with good, in the nett; he confirmeth this doctrine by the consent & iudgement of the Church of Rome, whose Bishops euen from Peter had imbraced it still, and constantly maintained it, the gates of hel in vaine assaulting them. So the wordes of Austin and Ierom doo import a sinceritie of faith in the Church of Rome & the Roman Bishops against the Arians and Donatistes: but neither of their wordes import the supremacie, which is a soueraintie of power.
            
            
               Hart.
               If they had not meant as well a soueraintie of power as sinceritie of faith: why should they mention that Church and not others? Were there no Bishops sincere through al ye world,

but the Bishops of Rome onely?

               Yes a great many, and they mention them too. For Ierom, though he asketh the aduise of Damasus, a young man of an old,

               Or, at least, you take it, though neither I doo graunt it, nor is it proued by S. Ierom. But this is proued, and I grant it, that he did not erre in the faith of the Trinitie, when Damasus was Bishop of Rome.

               When Damasus was Bishop? Why do you so restraine it? S. Ieroms wordes be generall. I am ioyned in communion vnto your holinesse, that is to Peters chaire. I know that the Church is builded vpon that rocke. Behold, to Peters chaire. He speaketh not to Damasus as in respect of Damasus, but in respect of the chaire, and so of the succession of the Bishops of Rome: that, what hee saith to one, belongeth to them all.

                     In apolog. 2. 
                  Athanasius, though hee say that Liberius condemned the heresie of the Arians, and therefore suffered banishment: yet hee saith withall, that hee continued not in suffering banishment to the end, but

                  through feare of death subscribed to that heresie with his hand, though with his heart he were still against it. Thus euen Athanasius, who liued at the same time with Liberius, and knew his state well, acknowledgeth that he subscribed: though iudging most friendly (both for his owne sake, and the causes,) that he consented not. But,

                        ntz. Metrop. l. 2. cap. 1. that Felix (the next Bishop of Rome after Liberius) was an Arian; he thought it. Wherefore, if he had meant ofthe whole succession of the Roman Bishops that which he wrote to Damasus, I am ioyned in communion vnto your holinesse, that is, to Peters chaire; I know that the Church is builded vpon that rocke: then hee must haue meant, that▪ before the time that Damasus was Bishop, he ought to haue béene ioyned in communion to the Arians, and that the Arians holinesse was the chaire of Peter, and that the Church was built vpon the rocke of Arians. But this abomination was farre from S. Ierom. S. Ierom therefore meant not the succession, but Damasus, who succéeded Peter, as in chaire, so in doctrine; and taught the faith which Peter did: a faith as cleane contrarie to the Arians faith, as light is to darkenes, as life is to death.

The gates of hell (saith Austin) preuaile not against the Priestes, that is, the Bishops, who succeede Peter. Then by his iudgement all the Roman Bishops are frée from all heresie. For the gates of hell are heresies, and the principall autours of heresies, as

               Did preuaile against it in the time of Austin: so you should conclude. You haue a pretie policie in citing the testimonies and sayings of the Fathers touching the Church of Rome: that what they did speake ofthe time present then, you vse it as spoken of the time present now. There was a gentlewoman in Rome, named Fabia: 
                  
                     Fab. Quintilia
                           •
                        . lib. 6. cap. 4. who being waxed olde, yet willing still to séeme young, said, in Tullies hearing, that she was thirtie yeares of age. That must needes be true, quoth Tullie; for I haue heard it of you twentie yeares ago. The Church of Rome hath defiled her selfe with idolatrie, & gone a whoring from the Lord: yet she would séeme a maide still, and so shee saith her selfe to be. I thinke you iest not with her, as Tullie did with Fabia: yet you proue her maidenhead, as Tullie did the youth of Fabia. You say that it must néedes be true: for it is writen ofher twelue hundred yeares ago. But that you may sée how small cause you haue to build so much on those wordes, The gates of hell preuaile not against the succession of the Bishops of Rome: consider what is meant by the gates of hell, and your graunt is past, that against some Bishops of Rome they haue preuailed. The state ofthe faithfull and chosen of God in this present life, is as it were 2. Cor. 10.4. 
                  a warfare: whereof the Church is called militant. The aduersaries and enimies whom we must fight against, our Sauiour speaketh of them as of a strong kingdome, which he calleth hell, because it warreth all for hel, and

All the which is meant by the name of gates, because the gates of fortes are wont to haue the best munition, and to be fensed most strongly.

For it is confessed by your selfe and yours, that sinnes haue preuailed, and preuailed monstrously against sundry of them.

Austins iudgement, that heresies of the Arians, or Donatistes, or others did not preuaile against them: I know no cause to the contrarie but hee might iustly say so then. For though the Arian heresie did set vpon Liberius fiersly and ouerthrew him,

                  Tertullian hauing said of them selues in Afrike that they haue autority from the Church of Rome, doth teach that the succession of that Church and See is to be set against all heretikes. And

                  Irenaeus reckening vp all the Roman. Bishops in order from Peter to Eleutherius of his time, doth adde, that it is a most ample declaration of the Apostolike faith to be of his side against the Valentinians. And

Wherefore the Church of Rome, and we, who are of that Church, haue an assured warrant that the faith which we professe is the true faith. For we haue the succession of the Roman Bishops from Peter to Gregory the thirtenth of our time: which is an inuincible fort against all heretikes; as the Fathers, Epiphanius, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Optatus, and Austin testifie.

               You will neuer leaue to daly with the Church of Rome, as Tullie did with Maistresse Fabia. The succession of the Roman Bishops is a proofe of the true faith: for so it was in the time of Austin, Epiphanius, Optatus, Tertullian, & Irenaeus, twelue hundred yeares ago & vpwarde. Succession was a proofe of the true faith, till Bishops, who varied from the truth succéeded: euen as 
                     Matt. 7.15. 
                  sheepes clothing was a marke of true Prophets till false Prophets came in it. But neither are true Prophets knowne now by shéepes clothing: nor the true faith by succession. The succession of Bishops was a proofe of true faith not in the Church of Rome alone, but in all, while they who succéeded the Apostles in place, succéeded them in doctrine

too, & kept that which 2. Tim. 1.14. 
                  Paule deliuered to Timothee & 2. Tim. 2.2. 
                  Timothee to others. But when rauening woolues were gotten into the roomes of pastours, and 
                     Act. 20.30. that was fulfilled which Paul foretold the Bishops of Ephesus, of your own selues there shall arise men speaking peruerse thinges to draw disciples after them: then succession ceased to be a proofe of true faith, for that it was no longer peculiar to the truth, but common to it with errour, and so a marke of neither, because a marke of both. This difference of succession betwene the later age and the former, the primitiue churches time and ours, is manifest by the Fathers them selues whom you alleage. For 
                     Lib. 3. cap. 3. & lib. 4. c. 63. 
                  Irenaeus (to beginne with the most auncient of them) saith, that the succession of Bishops in all Churches through the whole world doth keepe and teach that doctrine which the Apostles deliuered. Now it doth not so: nor hath these many ages since Irenaeus died. Hath it?
            
            
               Hart.
               Not in all Churches. But in the Church of Rome it doth, and hath, and shall for euer.

For beside the credit that it had as being Apostolike, ample, famous, auncient: it was the néerest also in place (amongst all the Apostolike Churches) to Irenaeus Bishop of Lyons in Fraunce; and so both known better and the more dealt with. In the which respect, other of the Fathers did chiefely name it too. As may appéere by

               The line of succession of the Roman Bishops hath bene still recorded in stories, and continueth yet. We can recken them from Peter the Apostle to Gregorie who sitteth now. Not so the Gréeke Bishops, the Churches ofthe East. Nay, the line of succession hath béene broken off in the chiefe of them, as the Chronicles do witnesse, euen in Alexandria, Antioche, and Ierusalem.

                  we must obey those priestes who with the succession of the Bishoply charge haue receiued the sure gift of the truth according to the will of God. Wherefore the succession of Constantinople, though they fetch it from the Apostles, yet proueth not the faith (which they professe) to be true, because they haue departed from the Apostles doctrine, in which they should succeede chiefely.

What trifling is this, to say first that succession of Bishops in place proueth truth of doctrine: and then to adde, that it doth so, if it haue succession in doctrine ioyned with it. In effect as if you said, that succession in place doth proue the doctrine to be true, if ye doctrine be true: & a couple of eares doo proue a creature to be a man, if they be a mans eares. The Fathers alleaged succession in place, not with condition, if it had; but with a reason, yt it had succession in doctrine. Proue me that you haue succession in doctrine: and then alleage vnto me the Fathers for succession. For if as S.

                  Austin saide against the Donatists after he had reckened the Bishops of Rome from Peter to Anastasius, In the ranke of this succession, there is not one Bishop found that was a Donatist; so you reckning them from Peter to Gregorie might say in like sort, In the rancke of this succession there is not one Bishop found that hath vsurped: then were your reason as fit against vs for the supremacy of the Pope, as S. Austins was for the Church against the Donatists.

experience afterwarde, that they could vsurpe, and would, if they were not curbed. For thrée of them, euen Zosimus, Boniface, and Caelestin did vsurpe ouer the Churches of Afrike while Austin was aliue yet: who with the whole Councell of abooue two hundred Bishops of that countrie, withstood their attempt as much as lay in him, and stayed their pride.

For the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it. There was some affection that troubled Gregories minde when he did chaunge that text, and (as it were) appropriate it to his Sée of Rome: and Stapletons heart was taken with some affection also, when he cited Gregorie to proue his purpose thence. For nether doth the title of the head of all Churches proue the Roman Papacie: neither doth Gregory, although he geue that title to the Church of Rome, yet proue it by that same text. The thing which he proueth, is, 
                     In psalm. 5. paenit. supra versum illum Tota die.
                   that the Emperour, who receyued money for ecclesiasticall liuinges and

spoyled the Church with s

                  monie, ought not so to doo, chiefly in the Church of Rome. For hauing touched his gréedinesse of this filthie gaine, yea he hath (saith Gregorie) stretched out so farre the rashnesse of his furie, that he chalengeth to him selfe the head of all Churches, euen the Church of Rome, and vsurpeth the right of earthly power ouer the ladie of nations. Which he did altogether forbidde to be doon, who specially committed this Church to S. Peter the Apostle, saying, To thee will I giue my Church. Wherein, that which Gregorie would say, is plaine enough, by the wordes that go before it. The maner of his saying and prouing it, is hard. For he saith of the Roman Church that the Emperour vsurpeth the right of earthly power ouer it. Whereby a man would thinke hee meant to denye the ciuill rule and gouernment of Rome to the Emperour, as now the Popes doo. Then which he meant nothing lesse: for 
                     Gregor. Registr. lib. 4. epist. 31. & 32. &c. passim.
                   he acknowledged himselfe the Emperours subiect, & vsed him accordingly. But he meant by [the right of earthly power vsurped ouer the Church,] the right of dealing with Church-liuings after the maner of the world, in setting them to sale as men doo farmes and leases: which is prophane and detestable. Now Gregorie being grieued 
                     Anastas. bibliothecar. in vita Agathon. Sigtabert. in Chron. ad ann. Christ. 680. that the Emperour asked money euen of the Bishop of Rome himselfe, 
                     Iohan. Diacon. in vit. Greg. lib. 1. cap. 40. whose election he confirmed with his royall assent: he thought good to amplifie the heinousnesse of the fact as most vnlawfull and wicked in the Church of Rome. And thereupon he saith that Christ did forbid it, who specially committed this Church to S. Peter, saying, To thee will I giue my Church. In the gospell we reade of Peter, 
                  
                     Luk. 9.33. that he knew not what he said, when he saide to Christ whom he beheld in glory, Maister it is good for vs to be here, and let vs make three tabernacles. Gregorie had a louing affection to Rome. Will you giue me leaue to thinke of him as of Peter, that he knew not what he said? For the wordes which he alleageth, are not the wordes of Christ, as you must néedes graunt. The thing he gathereth of them, is against the words of Christ: who generally committed 
                     Matt. 28.19, 
                  all Churches to Peter, (for he was an Apostle;) and, if any specially, it was

did Christ meane the Church of Rome specially, but generally the Catholike Church, euen all the chosen, when he said of his Church that the gates of hell should not preuaile against it. And if, as

Which to be the natural sense of Christes wordes: it is apparant to the eye. For the gates of hell preuaile against them, who are adiudged to death eternal. But 
                     Matt. 24.51. 
                  hypocrites and euill seruants are adiudged to it. The gates of hell therefore preuaile against such. Now such haue béene and may be the members, yea the heads of the Church of Rome. Then our Sauiour meant not that priuilege to them. Onely against the chosen and elect of God, the gates of hell preuaile not. For 
                     Rom. 8.30. 
                  whom he hath predestinate, them hath he also glorified. Wherefore it is the Church of Gods elect and chosen to whom our Sauiour meant it. And them he doth call in this place my Church; as in an other afterward to like effect, 
                     Ioh. 10.28. 
                  my sheepe. So what he meant there, by saying of his sheepe, to them I giue eternal life, and they shal neuer perish: the same he meant here, by saying of his Church, against it the gates of hel shall not preuaile. Which thing is so cléere out of all controuersie, that to passe ouer

               Howsoeuer Gregorie did either mistake the words of the scripture, or not apply them perhaps to the supremacie: yet is the supremacie proued by that title which he giueth the Church of Rome. For if the Church of Rome be the head of all Churches: why not the Bishop of Rome the head of all Bishops?

And whereas Canus thought, that to conuey Peters right vnto the Pope, the stories haue sufficient ground, which say that Peter set his chaire at Rome, and there died; or, if learned men shall not allow of that, an other ground may be,

                   that in déede it is a tradition, not of Christ, but of the Apostles: and least we should doubt of which of the Apostles, he nameth the man, Peter, euen a tradition of Peter. Let me intreate you, M. Hart, if all that I haue said, cannot preuaile with you, yet to regard the doctrine, the doctrine taught at Rome, of your owne, of the chiefest of your owne Doctors. Renounce the vnlearned folies of your Stapleton, & brainsicke furies of your Rhemists: who with desperate violence doo wrest the word of Christ, to make it serue the pride of Antichrist. Acknowlege that you haue not one text through all the scripture to proue the Popes supremacie: that when you tell men of Thou art Peter, and on this rocke, &, I haue prayed for the Peter, and, Peter, feede my sheepe; you do presume of their simplicitie:

that in truth these places doo not import it, but policie would haue somewhat saide, eis not so many would beleeue it: finally, that the Papacie is a deuise of Popes and Papists; for which, sith the scriptures can be abused no longer, because men haue espied the fraude, therefore a new cloake is found for it now, and hereafter it shall be counted a tradition of Peter.
               
            
         
         
            The eighth chapter. The autoritie 1 of traditions and fathers pretended to proue the Popes supremacie: in vaine; beside the scripture, which is the onely rule of faith. The Fathers, 2 being heard with lawfull exceptions that may be iustly taken against them, 3 doo not proue it. As it is shewed, first, in Fathers of the Church of Rome. By the way, 4 the name of Priest, the Priestly sacrifice of Christians, the Popish sacrifice of Masse-priestes, the proofes brought for the Masse, the substance and ceremonies of it, are laid open. And so it is declared that 5 neither the auncient Bishops of Rome themselues, 6 nor any other Fathers do proue the Popes supremacie.

               I should play in déede with your owne fansies, if I should graunt you that.
            
            
               Hart.
               But they, whom you alleaged, doo say that it did so: as your selfe haue shewed.

               But I will proue that they spake no truer in that, then you haue doone in the other.
            
            
               Hart.
               But what an iniurie is this, to presse mee with their former wordes of the scripture, whereas your selfe beleeue not the later of tradition?
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               What thinke you of S. Paule? Did hee beleeue those thinges which the heathnish Poets do write of Goddes and Goddesses, Bacchus, Diana, Minerua, Mercurie?
            
            
               Hart.
               He did not. What then?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Yet 
                     Act. 17.28. he alleaged them to perswade the Athenians, that in God we liue, and moue, and haue our being. What an iniury was that to presse the Athenians with Poets words of God, whereas himselfe beléeued not their wordes of Gods and Goddesses?
            
            
               Hart.
               The Poets might say well, and did, in the former: though in the later they missed.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Now, wil you deale as frendly with me, as with S. Paule? His case and mine are coosins.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, you in the selfe same sentence of our men cull out a péece of it, and yet an other péece of it you allow not.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Euen so did S. Paule. For that which he auouched out of their owne Poets, (the meaning of it is in 
                     Homer. Odyss. lib. 1. Orpheus & Callimachus hymnis in Iouem.

               Hart.
               Well: if you may diuide the sentence of Canus and

other sort then I haue done.

               That I wish. For the truth is like vnto camomill: the more you presse it down, the faster it groweth, and spreadeth fairer, and smelleth sweeter.
            
            
               Hart.
               So much of scripture then. Now to tradition: by which the Popes supremacie may be cléerely proued.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               By tradition? Why? Do you acknowlege then that it cannot be proued by scripture?
            
            
               Hart.
               I tell you no, once againe. How often must I say it?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Once saying will serue, if you do not vnsay your saying. But here in my iudgement you séeme to vnsay it. For you disclaime the title pretended by scripture, when you claime by tradition.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Why so? Might not the same thing both be writen in scripture, and deliuered by word of mouth?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               It might, & was no dout, as 2. Thess. 2.15. 
                  the traditions shew which S. Paule doth mention: which signify the doctrine that hee deliuered 
                     Act. 17.2. 
                  out of the scriptures. But you meane a doctrine not writen in the scriptures, when you speake of tradition. For

it is manifest that you renounce the scripture for proofe of any title, which you lay claime to by tradition. For scripture is writen; tradition, vnwriten. Wherefore, if by tradition you minde to proue the Popes supremacie; you must acknowlege first that it cannot be proued by scripture. If you bee not willing to ackonwlege that: I must debarre you from tradition.

Zepherinus, Marcellus, Melchiades, and Iulius. Yea, and that is more, the very same epistles of theirs are alleaged by Stapleton, which by Canus. If rightly by Canus: how may we trust Stapleton? If rightly by Stapleton; how may wee trust Canus? If rightly by them both: what trimme Popes are they, who with one breath doo say that the same thing is both writen and vnwriten? Yet Father Robert dealeth wiselyer, and like a Iesuite: who séeing the danger of naming speciall men and places, doth shrowd himselfe in the generall of Councels, Popes, and Fathers. As if an horse-stealer being to giue account of whom and where he got his horses, should say that he bought them of incorporations, horse-coursers, and honest men within Christendom.

               Well enough as you shoote it. For although the Lord hath planted the writings of the Fathers, as trees; in his Church, as in a Paradise; whereof there may be made good shaftes; blessed is the man that hath his quiuer full of them, they shall not be confounded but they shall destroy their enimies in the gate: yet not all the shaftes, which you do vse of theirs, are good;

               Hart.
               Whether I be able or no so to proue it, the thing it selfe will shew. But if you thinke not that a sufficient proofe, why saide you that the writinges of Fathers are as trees, whereof there may be made good shaftes, such as shall destroy their enimies in the gate; yea that the man is blessed who hath his quiuer full of them?
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               It is writen in the Psalmes, 
                     Psal. 127. vers. 2. 
                  Except the Lord keepe the citie, the keeper watcheth in vaine. By the which wordes the Prophet séemeth to haue thought, that the warde and watch of men is not sufficient for the defense of cities, vnlesse the Lord assist them with his watch and ward. How say? is not this true?
            
            
               Hart.
               So. What of that?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               That is an answere to your question. For the Prophet adding how 
                     vers. 3. 
                  God doth blesse men in giuing them children, saith, 
                     vers. 4. 
                  they are as arrowes in the hand of a strong man: 
                  
                     vers. 5.9. 
                  blessed is the man that hath his quiuer full of them; they shall not be confounded, but they shall destroy their enimies in the gate. If this be truly spoken of children well nurtured, who yet are not sufficient to defend a citie without the Lordes assistance: why might it not be spoken of Fathers well vsed, and yet they not suffice to decide a controuersie without the worde of God? For though I acknowledge there is good wood in them to make shaftes for the Lordes warres: yet is not all their wood such; some of it is knottie, some lithy, 
                     •
                  ome crooked. And the best arrowes, which are made thereof, vnlesse they haue heades of stronger mettall, then them selues, out of the Lords armorie: they are not sharpe enough to pearce into the harte of the kinges enimies, as are 
                     Psal. 45.5. 
                  the arrowes of our Salomon. Wherefore as of your part, 
                     Luk. 16.31. if you hearken not to Moses and the Prophetes, I haue no greate hope that Fathers will perswade you, though they should rise from the dead: so for my selfe I will assure you, that neither dead
                  
nor quicke, Fathers nor children, shall perswade me any thing in matters of religion, which they can not proue by Moses and the Prophetes. For, 
                     Act. 26.22. the Apostles preached not any thing, but that, which the Prophetes and Moses saide should come to passe. And if a Father, if a Saint,

               Yes: but your errour is in the worde praeterquàm, by which he meaneth contra quàm; not beside that, but against that. For there are sundrie thinges of faith and life to be preached beside them in the scriptures of the law and the gospell, but not against them. Wherefore if it were so that the Popes supremacie could not be proued by scriptures: yet the proofe of

it by the Fathers might be good. For it were not against the scriptures; although it were beside the scriptures.

                   where he saith thus. The Apostle did not say, If any man preach vnto you more then you haue receyued, but, beside that you haue receyued. For if he should say that, he should be preiudiciall to him selfe, who desired to come to the Thessalonians 
                  1. Thess. 3.10. 
                  that he might supply that which was wanting to their faith. Now he, that supplyeth, addeth that which was wanting; taketh not away that which was, and so forth. Whereby S. Austin sheweth that we may preach more then the scripture hath: but not beside it, that is to say, against it.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               He sheweth nothing lesse: as any man that readeth his discourse, may see. For, that which he speaketh of more, and of wanting, is not meant of scripture, that is, the worde writen; but of the worde preached & deliuered by mouth. Wherein he declareth that the Apostles maner of instructing men, was, 
                  1. Cor. 3.2. Hebr. 5.12. & 6.1. 
                  to feede them first with milke, not with strong meat. So, that which was wanting to the Thessalonians, was stronger doctrine of the faith: that which they had, was easier. Wherof though in the one he taught them more then in the other: yet no more in either, then 
                  
                     Act. 26.22. 
                  the scripture hath. And thus S. Austins more to be no more then scripture: himselfe maketh manifest by the example also which he giueth of it. For the doctrine of the manhead of Christ, he calleth milke; of the Godhead, strong meat. Now they who are taught to know him to be God, learne more then they had learned when they receaued him as man. But they learne no more then the scripture hath, 
                     Ioh. 1.15. Rom. 9.5. 1. Tim. 3.16. which teacheth him both God and man. Wherefore, that S. Austin condemning all who preach ought beside the scriptures of the law & the gospell, meant, that more then scriptures may be preached, but nought against them: it is not S Austins glose, but your Louanists, and in truth repugnant to S. Austins text. For

Which words doo shew plainly, yt as by the scriptures of the law & the gospel he signified the bookes of the Prophetes & Apostles: so by condemning all that is beside the scriptures, he meant, not, all that is against, but, all that is not in the scriptures. And that this was his meaning, he sheweth yet more plainely by willing them to proue their doctrine by the testament: which your Louan

                  Donatists, as he doth other often: we are brethrē, (saith he to them:) why doo we striue? Our father died not vntestate: he made a testament, & so died. Men do striue about the goods of the dead, till the testament be brought foorth: when that is brought, they yeeld to haue it opened, & read. The iudge doth hearken, the counsellours be silent, the cryer biddeth peace, all the people is attentiue, that the wordes of the dead man may be read & heard. He lyeth voide of life & feeling, in his graue, and his words preuaile: Christ doth sit in heauen, and is his testament gainesaied? Open it: let vs reade: we are brethren: why do we striue? Let our mindes be pacified. Our father hath not left vs without a testament. He that made the testament is liuing for euer. He doth heare our words: he doth know his owne word. Let vs reade: why doo we striue? Were not this a séely spéech of S. Austin, if hee had

meant, as you say, that all the Lords will is not declared in his testament: that thinges beside his owne worde may be proued by mens words? Let him be accursed who preacheth any point of faith, or life beside the scriptures. True: beside ye 
                  scriptures, yt is against the scriptures, say your Louan Doctours. Sée what skil can doo. If they were Doctours of ye Arches, we should haue ioly law. For a coosining marchant might claime a thousand pound of a dead mans goods, who had bequeathed him a legacy of twētie grotes: & they might adiudge it him with good consciences, as not against the testament, though beside the testament. Nay, they might do this with so much better reason, then they doo the other; by how much the testament of God is more perfit, thē any mans can be: and that which Christ bequeathed the Pope, is farre lesse in comparison of the supremacie, then twentie grotes of a thousand poundes. Wherfore, say the Doctors of Louan what they li
                     •
                  t, (perhaps they speake for their fée:) S. Austin meant plainely, that, sith the Donatists claimed the inheritaunce of Christ to them selues, they must proue their title by his will and testament. Which if they could not doo, or rather séeing that they could not: he pronounceth of them they had no right vnto▪ it. And thereupon he commeth to the generall sentence of the heauenly iudge, denouncing them accursed, who, in any point, either of faith, or life, doo preach beside that which is deliuered in the scriptures of the law and the gospel. Wherein if [beside] do signifie [against:] then all (in this respect) is against a testament, which is beside a testament.
            
            
               Hart.
               S. Austin, and Optatus, against the Donatists, doo speake reason: that, vnlesse they can proue their right by Christes testament, they may not shut the Catholikes out from his inheritance, and claime his goods vnto them selues. For it is meete that the will of the testator should be kept. But a learned lawier, one

                  Francis Baldwin, who hath set foorth Optatus, and writen notes vpon him, doth shew that a testament may be either nuncupatiuum (as he calleth it) or scriptum; either set down in writing, or vttered by word of mouth. What say you to testamentum nuncupatiuum?

               As who say the testament of Christ might not be writen in part, though not in whole. Which is Baldwins meaning, as it appéereth by the place, not of Optatus, but of Austin, whereto he applieth it.

               Hart.
               
                  Not so warily, as Austin doth. For Austin vseth it, when he will proue out of the scriptures that the Church is catholike: which was one of the pointes of their controuersie with the Donatists.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But in handling that point he maketh it a generall rule, that, whether it be of Christ, or of his church, or of any thing else whatsoeuer pertaining to our faith and life, nothing must be preached beside the scriptures, that is, the testament.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               But in an other point of their controuersie, touching baptisme, S. 
                  
                     De baptism. contra Donatist. lib. 4. cap. 6. 
                  Austin doth alleage not so much the scripture, as the tradition of the Apostles.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  Not so much the scripture. He doth the scripture then: though he alleageth also the custome of the Church deliuered by the Apostles. But what is that against the testament?
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, beside the testament, which is the word writen, he doth commend vnwriten traditions in other places. Which proueth that he thought not the testament sufficient to decide all controuersies.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Now S. Austin findeth fauour at your hands, who make him say and vnsay the same. But where vnsaith hée that of the sufficiencie of scripture?
            
            
               Hart.

warneth vs that we should go to the coondit head, which is the tradition of the Apostles, and thence direct the pipe to our owne times: that is best and to be done out of all dout. These are S. Austins owne wordes.

Traditum est ergo nobis (sicut ipse commemorat) ab Apostolis, quòd sit vnus deus, & Christus vnus, & vna spes, & fides vna, & vna ecclesia, & baptisma vnum. That is to say: It is deliuered therefore to vs by the Apostles (as Cyprian himselfe rehearseth) that there is one God, and one Christ, and one hope, and one faith, and one church, and one baptisme. These are S. Austins owne wordes, and grounded on S.

                  Cyprian too. So that he, and Cyprian, meant by [tradition] that, which is deliuered: and that to be deliuered, which is writen in the scriptures. For this selfe same thing, whereof they speake, is writen in the epistle of

                  Paule to the Ephesians. Wherefore, their traditiō
                   is tradition writen, that is to say, scripture: and not vnwriten stuffe, as your Iesuit would haue it. Yea Cyprian is so plaine for controuersies to be decided by this tradition onely, that in the same epistle (whence Austin citeth this) to the words of Stephanus, Traditum est, it is deliuered, vnde est ista traditio, faith he, whence is this tradition? Doth it come from the authoritie of the Lord and the gospell, or from the commaundements and epistles of the Apostles? For that we must doo those things which are writen, God doth witnesse saying to Ioshua, 
                  
                     Ios. 1.8. 
                  Let not this booke of the law depart out of thy mouth: but meditate in it day and night, that thou maiest obserue to performe all thinges which are writen therein. And likewise the Lorde sending his Apostles willed them that 
                  
                     Matt. 28.20. 
                  the nations should bee baptized, and taught to obserue all things which he had commaunded. Wherefore if this thing (of the which Stephanus saith, it is deliuered,) be commaunded in the gospell, or contained in the epistles or actes of the Apostles: let this diuine and holy tradition be obserued. Sée you not how Cyprian thought, that all, which Christ commanded to be taught, is writen? How hee meant this writen doctrine by tradition? How his words of this tradition are approued by Austin? What conscience had your Iesuit to alleage that for traditions beside scriptures, which they so plainely meant of the scriptures them selues?
            
            
               
               Hart.
               I do not sée this, neither in S. Austin, nor in S. Cyprian.

               Hart.
               Yet Pamelius addeth, that, if S. Cyprian had bene instructed better that the scriptures cited by him to proue his errour, are not of force thereto: S. Austin douteth not but he would haue allowed the contrary tradition.

               As pregnant as the former. For it foloweth straight: Now the faith of our Fathers is this; we beleeue in God the father almightie, maker of all things visible and inuisible, and so he goeth forward with the pointes of Christian faith. Wherby it is apparant that he meant by [the tradition of the Fathers] their faith. But their faith is writen (the substance of it) in the scriptures. Therefore your Iesuit faileth in this tradition too. Moreouer S. Austin, if he wrote that sermon, whereof your

                  Louan censours dout, but he, who wrote that sermon, entreateth of the Trinitie. But touching the Trinitie nothing must be said beside the rule of faith, which is set downe in scriptures: as 
                     Chapt. 2. Diuision 2. I haue shewed by S. Austin. Wherefore if S. Austin had meant of vnwriten tradition in that point: S. Austin would retract it. But indeede the Iesuit hath ouerséene S. Austins workes very cunningly. Who, bearing men in hand that he hath gathered the summe of Austins doctrine out of all his workes, yet concealeth that 
                     Confess. August. lib. 1. cap. 7. in the chapter of scriptures, which Austin saith of their sufficiencie: & faceth that out 
                     cap. 8. in the chapter of traditions, which should haue bene defaced by that which Austin saith of scriptures. Howbeit, were it true, that the scriptures without traditions are vnperfit and vnsufficient to proue the

will of God: you are no néerer your purpose, that the proofe of it by Fathers is sufficient. For a testament, that is made by worde of mouth without writing, must be proued by solemne witnesses. The solemne witnesses of Christes testament, are the Prophets, and Apostles. So that vnlesse you proue by Prophets and Apostles, that part of the testament of Christ is vnwriten, & that hée gaue the Pope supremacie in that part: your proofe by the Fathers will neuer stand in law. Notwithstanding, though it bée against both law and reason, that the Pope should take the whole inheritaunce of Christes Church, and put all Bishops to their legacies, vnlesse he proue his right by the testament of Christ: yet, if you can proue it (as I said) by the Fathers, I am content to yéelde vnto it.

               They are worthie Prelates, what count soeuer you make of them. But who shall iudge, if not they?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               When an issue is ioyned to be tryed by the countrie, the iury, that shal try it, ought to be of such as be next neighbors, most sufficient, and ieast suspicious. This is the law of England. How doo you like your countrie law? hath it not reason?
            
            
               Hart.
               It hath. But this issue of ours must be tryed by the Church, not by the countrie.

               I graunt. But the equitie of our countrie law doth hold in the Church too.

               For many causes. They are not frée holders. They are the Popes tenants, his sworne vasals, our sworne enimies:

               Then name your selfe the men whom you will admit to be of the iury.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Nay, I will name none. But I am indifferent

to all who are indifferent: who haue skill to iudge of the euidence that is brought, and conscience to giue verdict according to the truth.
            
            
               Hart.
               
                  According to the truth of the euidence, you meane. For so a iury ought. And so let all indifferent men be of the iury. For the wordes of the witnesses which I will bring shall be so full, so plaine in sense, so strong in proofe, that they must néedes condemne you: vnlesse they will giue verdict against the euidence and their consciences.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The crow doth thinke her own birdes fairest. But I must desire the iury to consider that the witnesses, whose wordes you will bring, are not aliue.
            
            
               Hart.
               Aliue? What is that to the tryall of our issue?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Much. For if they liued and did appeere before the iury, first, they should be sworne to say the truth, and al the truth, and nothing but the truth. Whereby they might bee moued both to speake more wa
                     •
                  ily, and to enforme the iury more throughly, then they haue doon. Next, it would be easier to examine them of their age, their estate, the circumstances of their persons; of their spéeches, the meaning, the occasion and cause thereof. Which all are helpes to finde out the truth of thinges in controuersie. Thirdly, if it appeered by examination, that either for their persons, or for their speeches, they are vnworthie of credit: then it should bee lawfull to except against them. A libertie, which 
                     L. Testium fides. D. de Testibus.
                   law doth graunt against witnesses, if there be cause of iust exception. Yet you perhaps (as your men are wont) would make outcrye, if I should vse it against them who are dead and absent. Wherefore vnlesse the iury doo supply that by wisedome and equitie, which wanteth in the course of tryall, by reason that the witnesses whom you will bring are not aliue: they may be deceyued by names and shewes of witnesses, and thereby giue a verdict which shall proue no verdict. For verdict is a speech of veritie.
            
            
               Hart.
               An honest mans worde is as good as his oth. For as he will not forsweare: so neither lye. The Fathers must not therefore be the lesse beleeued, because they are not sworne.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Yet an honest man, when he is sworne, wil speake more fully and maturely then when he is vnsworne. And hée may say that sometime on coniecture, which on his oth he would

not say.
            
            
               Hart.
               But that may be perceyued by the Fathers writings, when they doo pronounce of a thing, as certaine; when, as vncertaine, they coniecture it. And so may other circumstances (which you require) be knowne too: as well as if them selues were present.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Not so well. For their writings doo not answere to many questions, which, if they were present, I woulde aske of them. But I am content with that which may be knowne so. Let the iury weigh it, and iudge thereafter of their credit.
            
            
               Hart.
               What? Shall meaner men, who be aliue now, iudge of the credit of the Fathers, who were so long in time, so farre in giftes before them?

                  To bring forth the witnesses, it was my part: let it be yours to iudge of the credit of the witnesses. It séemed reason to S. Ierom that Euagrius should iudge of of the witnesses whom he brought. What is there more in the Fathers, then was in those witnesses? What was there more in Euagrius, then is in many who liue now?

               I pray be good to M. Iewell for M. Optatus and Fulgentius sake: who 
                     Optat▪ contr. Parmen. lib. 1. Fulgent. ad Trasimundum Reg. lib. 1. both haue missealleaged the same words of Christ, yea one of them in like sort, as Bishop Iewell did. For, to proue that the words of the Lord to Esay,

                  Cry and cease not, were spoken not to Esay onely, but to all preachers, he vseth this reason, that Christ doth say to his disciples, what I say to one of you, I say to all. Wherin, as the doctrine of a preachers duty is true, though the proofe be false: so is in Bishop Iewell the doctrine of the Apostles duety. And Bishop Iewels proofe, from one Apostle vnto all, is better grounded on the wordes, then the other from Esay the Prophet to all preachers. Moreouer the faulte remaineth vncorrected in

               The same would you iudge of M. Iewel, if some what did not blinde your eye. But by this your iudgement I see, that where the Fathers mistake the wordes of scripture, they may be refused. What if they mistake, not the wordes but the sense: may we refuse them also there? As

               I doo not say it was an heresie. I say that they mistooke the meaning of the scripture: which you can not denie. Yea some times, when they neither mistooke the words, nor the meaning, yet they taught amisse out of it. As, that

There is a famous fable touching the assumption of the blessed virgin: that, when the time of her death approched, the Apostles (then dispersed throughout the world to preach the gospell) were taken vp in cloudes, and brought miraculously to Ierusalem to be present at her funerall. This tale in olde time was writen in a booke which bare the name of Melito,

               Doo you call the assumption of our Ladie, a fable? What impietie is this against the mother of our Lord, that excellent vessell of grace? whom 
                     Luk. 1.41. 
                  all generations ought to call, blessed. But you can not abide her prayses and honours. Nay, you haue abolished not onely her greatest feast of her assumption, but of her conception and natiuitie too. So as it may bee thought the diuell beareth a special malice to this woman, whose seede brake his head.

                  the diuell when he did striue with Michael about the bodie of Moses, (
                     Deut. 34.6. whom the Lord buried, the Iewes knew not where,) did striue

                  that his bodie might bee reuealed to the Iewes, to the entent that they might worship it and commit idolatrie. But it is out of doubt, that when he moued 
                     Act. 14.11. 
                  the people of Lystra to sacrifice vnto Paul and Barnabas, and to call them Gods, he meant to deface the glory of God, by the too much honouring and praysing of his Saintes. We can abide the prayses of Barnabas and Paule: but not to haue them called Gods. We can abide their honours; but not to sacrifice vnto them. Wee know that the diuell doth beare a speciall malice both to the woman and to the womans seed. But whether he doth wreake it more vpon the séede, by your sacrificing of prayses and prayers to ye woman, or by our not sacrificing: let

For though you beléeue not that her bodie is assumpted, yet you wil not (we trow) deny that she is dead, and her soule in glory. But you doo neither celebrate that, nor any other of her proper feastes. For as for the dayes of her purification and annuntiation, they be not proper to our Ladie: but the one to Christes conception, the other to his presentation.

               Good words, M. Hart. Your plaister, of mediators of intercession and saluation, is too narrow for this soare. Your pang doth make you not to sée it.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay: no whit to narrow. For the mediation which we giue to Saintes, is so farre inferiour to the diuine and singular mediation of Christ, that whereas we say to them, Pray for vs, we say not so to him, we doo not thinke of him so basely, but wée desire him to haue mercy vpon vs. Wherefore, we make him onely mediatour of saluation; and them, of intercession.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Yet is your plaister too narrow for the soare which you apply it too. For the blood and woundes of Thomas are presented, in the prayers that I spake off. And although you thinke not of intercession generally, as 
                     Hebr. 7.25. the scripture doth, which maketh it proper to 1. Tim. 2.5. 
                  the only mediatour betweene God and man, the man Christ Iesus: yet (I hope) you thinke of that intercession by the blood and woundes, that it is his alone, who gaue him selfe a raunsome for vs, and 1. Pet. 1.1

                     . 
                  redeemed vs with his pretious blood. But if it were so that Thomas might bée made a mediatour of intercession in this preeminent sort: that can not heale your Portesse. For it doth make him 
                     •
                  latly a mediatour of saluation: not onely to pray for vs, but to haue mercy vpon vs.

But, to the purpose of my question, if they of your Church, who reformed your Seruice-bookes, thought, that of the prayers which we doo mislike they might abolish some and retaine others: what if amongst the feastes which others doo mislike, they, who reformed our ceremonies, retained the annuntiation and purification of the virgin, though they abolished the conception, natiuitie, and assumption? Chiefly séeing that in those, which they reteined, they regarded the honour of Christ conceiued and presented, as your selues acknowledge: in those, which they abolished, they remoued the superstitious worship of a creature, as the thing witnesseth. For both they were supposed to be feastes instituted to a Saintes honour, as they were indéede: neither is there any thing of them in the scriptures, that men might be edified by that wherof the memorie was celebrated in them: and they maintaine corrupt opinions, touching the virgin, with derogation to Christes honour.

                   Canon-law condemned sundry countries, and England namely, for kéeping it. But the conception and natiuitie of the blessed virgin make her scarse equall vnto Christ: the feast of the assumption doth lift her somwhat higher. For when Christ was taken vp into heauen: 
                     Luk. 24.30. Act. 1.12. 
                  the Apostles were lead forth a litleway on foote, to sée it and witnes it. But to her assumption they were brought by miracle, in cloudes, as in chariots, from all the coastes of the world, through which they were dispersed. And this is it which I called, and cal againe, a fable, or if you will, a lye, as 
                     Retract. in Act. Apost. c. 8.

               Hart.
               It is a true storie, as our Diuines of Rhemes doo 
                     •
                  ouch it: though, as he reported it whom venerable Bede doth touch, it was a lye. For 
                     Melito de transitu S. Mariae.
                   he reported it to haue béene doon the second yeare after Christes ascension▪
                   which Bede doth proue it could not be. But our Diuines referre it to the fifteenth yeare after. For they take the common opinion that she liued three score and three yeares in all. Now,

                  shee brought forth Christ when she was fifteene yeare olde. So that her assumption was eight and fortie yeares after Christs natiuitie. And this agréeth with

               I graunt. For that circumstance can not stand with scripture: as venerable Bede doth proue.

               What if some were deceiued in circumstance of time. Yet the storie notwithstanding of her assumption is true, as our Diuines of Rhemes report it. For

                  Damascene writeth,) al the Apostles, then dispersed into diuers nations to preach the gospell, were miraculously brought togither, (sauing S. Thomas who came the third day after,) to Ierusalem, to honour her diuine departure and funerall, as the said S. Denys writeth. Who saith, that him self, S. Timothee, and S. Hierotheus were present: testifying

also of his owne hearing, that, both before her death and after for three daies, not onely the Apostles and other holy men present, but the Angels also and powers of heauen did sing most melodious hymnes. They buried her sacred body in Gethsemani. But for S. Thomas sake, who desired to sée and to reuerence it, they opened the sepucher the third day: and finding it voide of the holy body, but excéedingly fragrant, they returned, assuredly déeming that her body was assumpted into heauen. As the Church of God holdeth, being most agréeable to the singular priuilege of the mother of God: and therefore celebrateth most solemnely the day of her assumption. And it is consonant not onelie to the said S. Denys, & S. Damascene, but to S.

               He wrote no such epistle. Your Rhemistes did mistake their Portesse, whence this stuffe is borowed. For reading there, that Denys wrote hereof to Timothee, they thought it had béene in an epistle to Timothee. The place, which they meant, is in a 
                     Dionys. ad Timotheum de diuin. nomin. cap. 3. 
                  booke entitled of the names of God: pretended to be writen to Timothee by Denys.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               In a booke, or an epistle; it is a great matter why you should charge them with lying.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I doo not therefore charge them with it. Neither would I mention this, but to point you the place in which they lye. For they say that S. Denys writeth these & these things: where neither the autour who writeth is S. Denys, neither writeth he the thinges which they alleage. Touching the thinges, first, he saith no more thereof but that amongst the Bishops inspired of the holy Ghost Hierothe
                        •
                     s excelled all the rest (saue

the Apostles) in praysing Christes goodnesse, when him selfe, and Timothee, and many of their holy brethren,

                     . 
                  came together to behold the body which receyued God, and which the Prince of life was in. As for the miracle of the Apostles brought together, S. Thomas comming the thirde day after, the Angels singing hymnes three dayes, the buriall of the virgins body, the desire of Thomas to see it, the sepulcher opened for his sake, and the body assumpted into heauen: he saith not one worde of these conceites, not one word. Nay he rather saith against them. For he noteth namely that Iames was also present the brother of the Lord, and Peter the chiefe and ancientest toppe of the Apostles. Which it is not likelie he would so note of two Apostles, if they had all béene present. Much lesse is it likely that he would say nothing of so great a miracle, if any such had happened.
            
            
               Hart.
               Perhaps it is writen in some other parte of S. Denys workes.

               In no part at all of anie worke that beareth the name of S. Denys.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Not that is extant now. But he wrote manie more▪ as

               Rainoldes.
               Nay, that which Damascene mentioneth is 
                     De diuinis nominibus ad Timotheum.
                   the booke I spake of: whence all, that he citeth, is taken word for word. Yea Nicephorus also 
                     Histor. eccle. lib. 2. cap. 22. doth alleage the same, (quoting 
                     In tertio capite ad Timotheum.
                   the very chapter) as the onely place wherein the assumption of the blessed virgin is proued by S. Denys. The more doo I maruell what should moue your Rhemists to say that S. Denys writeth and witnesseth that all the Apostles were brought miraculously together, to honour her diuine departure; yea and that he testifieth of his own hearing, that both before her death and after, for three dayes, the Angels did sing most melodious hymnes: vnlesse they were disposed to lye for the whetstone. But this, of the thinges. The other, of the autour, is not so great a faute: yet a faute too. For they would haue men thinke that he who wrote this worke

               That is a weake coniecture why he should be a counterfeit. For he might call the tradition of the Apostles, old tradition: though it were but certain yeares or moneths before him.

But, to leaue the proofes which touch other matters, or stand on mens coniectures, or you may haue some colour of exception against: I will proue him a counterfeit by the same point for which you alleaged him; and that by demonstration out of the holy scriptures; and that by the confession of your Rhemists themselues. You alleaged him as a witnesse of the assumption of the blessed virgin. Him selfe saith that Timothee came with him togither, and many of their holy brethren, to behold her body. The scriptures shew that 
                     Act 9.5. 
                  Paule was not conuerted to Christ, till after Christes ascension. When he was conuerted, 
                     Gal. 1.18. he staied three yeares in Damascus and Arabia, before 
                     Act. 9.26. he came to Ierusalem. Thence 
                     Gal. 1.21. he went into the coastes of Syria and Cilicia, 
                  
                     Act 13.4. and the countries there about. And 
                     Gal. 2 1. 
                  foureteene yeares after he came againe to Ierusalem, with Barnabas, 
                  
                     Act. 15.4. to the Councell. From the Councell 
                     Act. 16.1. he went to Derbe, and Lystrae: where he receiued Timothee. And hauing trauailed through Phrygia, Galatia, Mysia, Macedonia, he came at last to Athens, where 
                     Act. 17.34. he conuerted Denys the Areopagite. So that it was seuenteene or eighteene yeares at least after Christs ascension, before S. Denys knew Christ. New, the blessed virgin died the fifteenth yeare after Christes ascension, as your Rhemists put: who yet take the largest time ofher life; for

                   other stories make it shorter. S. Denys therefore could not be one of the brethren who came togither to be present at her death and funerall. And all this is graunted and proued by your Rhemists: though they thought not ofit. For, in their After the Actes of the Apostles.
                   
                  table of S. Paule, they shew that it was the one and fiftieth yeare of Christ, when he conuerted S. Denys the Areopagite; and in their 
                     Annot. vpon the Act. 1.14. tale of the virgin they recken her to be assumpted the eight & fourtieth yeare of Christ. Wherefore you do vs great iniurie, to say, that we deny S. Denys to haue writen those workes because he giueth testimonie for the Catholike faith in most things now cōtrouersed. For, that which we deny, is, in respect of the truth, because indéede he wrote them not. But, in respect of his testimonie for the Catholike faith, I wish that I might graunt with a safe conscience that hee wrote them. He is so plaine against the most of your heresies: chiefly the Popes supremacie.
            
            
               Hart.
               Neither is that an heresie, nor is he against it: nay hée

is plaine for it. For

               Rainoldes.
               But he saith farther, that, 
                     Eccles. hierar. cap. 7. 
                  for as much as the scriptures say to Peter, Whatsoeuer thou shalt bind on earth shall bee bound in heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heauen, 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  therefore he, and (accordingly to him) euery Bishop doth admit the godly, and disinherite the godlesse, by declaring the sentence and administring the word of God. And this doth plucke vp the Popes supremacie by the rootes. For your 
                     Francis. Sansouin. de regnis & rebusp. l. 11. Sander. de visib. monar. eccles. lib. 7. maisters ground it on that charge of binding and loosing giuen Peter: as though after Peter it were proper to the Pope. Denys saith the contrarie, that it is common to all Bishops. Whereby you may perceiue beside, that if the title which he giueth Peter did proue his supremacie, though 
                     Chapt. 5. Diuis. 3. I haue shewed it doth not, but if it did: yet your commō reason, from Peters supremacie to the Popes, is iointlesse.

               Our Rhemists will render good account (I dout not) of this which they haue writen, when they shall heare what is said against it. And that which you declared out of the holy scriptures concerning the time of S. Denys conuersion, which is the greatest argument that you brought yet to disproue the storie auouched of his presēce at the departure of our Lady: I must referre to them. For I my selfe know not indéede how to accord it. But why do you presse that point about the Fathers, touching their ouerseeing ether the wordes, or meaning, or consequent of the scriptures? We are past the scriptures, and proofes that the Fathers do gather out of them.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But if they may gather amisse out of the scriptures, and ouershoote them selues in the word of God: they may be deceiued in the word of man too, and either not conceiue well, or not remember well, or not conclude well of it. Which hapned to S. Ierom in that same point, that I reproued a litle rather in Eusebius. For 
                     Hieron. de scriptorib. ecclesiast. verbo Philo.
                   he, reckning Philo the Iew amongst the Christian ecclesiastical writers, doth it (he saith) for this reason, because Philo writing a booke touching the first Church planted by the Euangelist S. Mark in Alexandria, hath praised the Christians: reporting them to be not onely there but in many countries, and calling their dwelling places, Monasteries. Whereby it is apparant that the Church of beleeuers in Christ, at the first, was such as moonkes endeuour and seeke to be now, that nothing is any mans owne in proprietie, none is rich amongst them, none poore, their patrimonies are distributed to the needy, they giue them selues wholy to prayer, and to singing of Psalmes, and to learning, and to continencie of life: such as S. 
                  
                     Act. 4.32. 
                  Luke also doth write, that the beleeuers were first at Ierusalem. And this booke of Philo touching the life of our men, that is, of men Apostolike, is

entitled of the contemplatiue life of men that pray, because they did contemplate (studie, and meditate) heauenly things, and prayed to God alwayes. Thus farre S. Ierom. Wherein, that the pointes of contemplation and prayer, being somewhat like in them whom Philo wrote off and in the Christian Church, did make him to mistake the one for the other, as likenes (they say) is the mother of error: but, that they were not Christians whom Philo meant in that booke, it may appeere by foure circumstances, of names, of deedes, of times, and of places. For they, of whom Philo doth write, were called Essees: which was a sect of Iewes, of whom

                     Philo de vita contemplatiua.
                   
                  some in contemplation. The Christians were neuer knowne by name of Essees, either contemplatiue or actiue. Againe, they in Philo did leaue their goods and substance to their sonnes, or daughters, or kinsemen, or if they had no kinsemen, to their friendes. The Christians gaue them to the poore, and such as stood in need of succour. Moreouer ye solemne day, which they in Philo did meete together publikely to heare the word of God taught, was the seuenth day of the weeke: which was the Sabbat of the Iewes, the saterday as we cal it. The Christians were wont to meete on 
                     Act. 20.7. Cor. 16.2. 
                  the first day of the weeke, that is,

The Christians liued in cities. Euen they who are namely mentioned by Ierom, I meane the Christian Church placed by S. Marke in Alexandria, were planted

                  without it. Wherefore it is manifest that Ierom did mistake, or had forgot, the wordes of Philo. Howbeit if he had both well conceiued and remembred them: yet he thereof inferred amisse, that the moonkes in his time were such, as S. Luke doth write that the beleeuers were first at Ierusalem. For the beleeuers at Ierusalem might keepe their owne if they listed: as 
                     Act. 5.4. 
                  Peter saith to Ananias; while it remained, perteined it not to thee? And when it was sold, was it not in thine own power? But 
                     Epist. 1. ad Heliodorum.
                   
                  Ierom saith that his moonks may not haue proprietie in any thing of their owne. Beside, the moonkes of Ierom did liue in continencie. The beléeuers at

                  Ierusalem had wiues, & vsed them: for any thing yt

                  solitarie, and not collegiate moonkes. But the beléeuers at Ierusalem, were at Ierusalem, in a citie, and liued in fellowship together. Doo you not sée that the Apostles and Apostolike men were not such as afterwarde the moonkes whom Ierom meaneth: and therefore Ierom was deceiued?
            
            
               Hart.
               I will not beléeue on your worde, that so worthie a Father was deceiued.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               If you will not on my worde, I will bring his owne worde to make you beléeue it. For, 
                     Epist. 13. ad Paulin. de institut. monachi.
                   writing to Paulinus, touching the training vp of moonkes, he saith that the Apostles and Apostolike men are not paterns for them to folow: but S. Antonie, and others, who dwelt in fieldes and deserts.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               He saith, that the Apostles and Apostolike men are set for an example to Priestes, and Bishops, not to moonkes. True: in some respectes. And yet, me thinkes too. But what if the Fathers perhaps might be deceiued so, through ouersight?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               If they might be deceiued so through ouersight: they might be deceiued through affection also. For they were men, and subiect to it. As 
                     Epist. 73. ad Iubaian.
                   
                  Cyprian, through too much hatred of heretikes, condemned the baptisme of heretikes, as vnlawfull: wherein

Unlesse hee meant him rather perhaps to be of that sorte which did not onely take by heare-say of others, but coyned lyes themselues too: & wrote those thinges of Saintes

haue defiled the stories of Saintes with filthie fables. Yet out of such stories many thinges are read in your Church-seruice. And

                  vncertaine, forged, friuolous, and false: yet haue they doon it sparingly. If they should haue left out all those legend-toyes: their Portesse had beene like our booke of common prayer, which heretikes would haue laught at: and there had remained no shew in a maner of the olde religion, saue that their seruice is in Latin.

Gelasius, and the seuentie Bishops, who were assembled in a Councel with him, were assembled about eleuen hundred yeares ago. Yet euen then how manie stories of the Saintes were set abroade with forged fables? almost a whole bead-roale,

                  the actes of Paule and Tecla, may serue for an example. These actes contained a storie (supposed to be omitted in the The foureteenth chapter of the Actes.
                   actes of the Apostles) how that when S. Paule did preach at Iconium, Tecla a maiden betrothed to a gentleman, hearing him preach of maidenhood, forsooke her husband by and by, and went away with him: and thereupon was persecuted, and deliuered from great dangers, and wrought many miracles, and trauailed through sundry countries with S.

                  good will that he bare to Paule. Such a credit (belike) he thought it would be to S. Paule, that a maide betrothed to a man of wealth and worship, (and so

Wherefore, though you minde not to presse me with thinges of later writers, but of old & ancient, as you say: yet was it not impertinent to mention your Portesse and stories of the like autoritie. For neither doo I know what number of yeares you will thinke sufficient to proue a writer old: and though you account none olde, but such as liued many hundred

yeares since; yet are their fables in your Portesse (as namely

                  To the point in question, as direct as may be. For this Thomas died

                   vpon occasion of a quarrell about the Popes supremacie: while he maintained appeales (against the king) to the Pope. Now, to proue that he stood in defense of the truth, those miracles were wrought. For, that, which they preached who had the grace of miracles, was the truth, saith 
                     Motiu. 6. 
                  Bristow: adding, that S. Thomas of Canterbury, S. Thomas of Aquine, S. Francis, S. Dominike, and infinit others had that grace, in such sorte, that no man is able to put any difference betweene the miracles of Christ with his Apostles, and of these men. Yet well-fare their heartes who reformed your Portesse. For they haue put out those miracles of S. Thomas of Canterbury, and many others: which they would not haue doon, (I trow,) had they not knowne some difference betwéene the miracles of these men, and the miracles of Christ. But they haue left in as worthie a miracle, as those, of an other of Bristowes miracle-workers, euen of S. Thomas of Aquine: and (I hope) you will not call that an idle fansie; though it be as idle with me, as the former. For

                  Thomas, thou hast writen well of me, Thomas. I should haue thought (for my part) that the wodden crucifix of a louing thankfull hart, had commended him, because he did honour it with the fame honour that is due to God, and

                  the doctrine of Thomas was approued by the mouth of the crucifix him self in this miracle. And he knew best the meaning ofit. So yt I perceyue this miracle was rather a dogmaticall miracle (as

                     Chapt. 5. Diuis. 2 I haue shewed) he forgeth and belyeth the Fathers notably, in the defense of the Popes supremacie against the Grecians. I can hardly think, that, when the crucifix said Thomas had writen well, it meant to approue his writing in that point. Or if the crucifix meant it, the crucifix was to blame: vnlesse the faute were rather in some lying knaue, who spake out of the crucifix. Such

               Euill mindes turne all thinges to the worst. Pope Pius the fifth doth say of that miracle, that it 
                  
                     Sicutipia testatur historia.

               Rainoldes.
               But, in what story, Pope Pius doth not say. Belike he meaneth Antoninus: of whom you know what Canus iudgeth; and his iudgement therein is good.
            
            
               Hart.
               Yet you can not deny but that Antoninus reporteth many true thinges. And why may not that miracle (I pray) be one of them?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               A lying miracle, no doubt, as

                  Antoninus reporteth it. For he saith that when Thomas was commanded by Pope Gregorie to come vnto the Councell of Lions, and to bring with him that booke which he had made by Pope Vrbanes commandement against the errours of the Grecians, whereof in that Councell they were to be conuicted: before he went thither, that voyce was heard out of the crucifix, by certaine who watched Thomas, as he was praying, on a certaine night, in S. Dominikes coouent-church. I say nothing here of the suspicious circumstances, the time, the night season; the place, the coouent-church; the witnesses, lying in waite; the cause, to proue that which should bee handled for the Pope against the Grecians in the Councell. Onely this I say, that séeing in that booke (against the errors of the Grecians) Thomas doth falsifie the writinges of S. Cyrill, and of aboue six hundred Fathers, euen the generall Councel of Chalcedon, to make them beare witnesse for the Popes supremacie: the miracle pretended to haue declared, as from heauen, that Thomas did well in handling so the cause of Christ, was a lying miracle▪ lying, in respect of the forme, or of the end; I meane, as either wrought by deceit, or to deceit; by deceit, ifmen did counterfeit

the voice; to deceit, if they hearde it miraculously in deede. As it is writen touching the man of sinne, that 2. Thess. 2. v

                   the holy Father Pope Pius the fifth hath honoured his memorie with a double greater feast in his countrie, and with a double feast throughout all Christendome, to be kept as solemnly as the holy dayes of the foure Doctours of the Church are kept. Wherefore you ought to thinke so much the more reuerently of all that he hath writen, and not to charge him with forging and falsifying, if he haue missed ought: but rather to suppose that if the autours haue not that which he alleageth, yet he had read it alleaged by some other, and of a good affection to the Sée of Rome he thought it to be rightly alleaged, and wrote it.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  Of a good affection. As you will. Let it be so. He, with such dealing of a good affection, hath feasted the Pope: and the Pope againe of a good affection hath double feasted him. But you graunt then that Doctors of the Church may bee deceyued, as through ouersight, so through affection too: and that these exceptions against them are lawfull.
            
            
               Hart.
               Lawfull, if you proue that they be so deceiued. For they may be, I graunt.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               What? And may they not be deceiued also, or rather seeme to be deceyued through the affection or ouersight of other men?
            
            
               Hart.
               Of other men? How?

               As when a Greeke writer is translated into Latin, the translator maketh him sometimes to say that which he neuer meant. And before printing, the scriueners, who copied out bookes with hand, committed sundrie scapes. Which

likewise befalleth vnto printers now. So there may be a faute in an autour without the autours faute, through ouersight of printers, or scriueners, or translators. For example, in the story ecclesiasticall of 
                     Euseb. histor. eccles. l. 2. c. 1. 
                  Eusebius translated by Rufinus, it is alleaged out of Clemens that Peter, Iames, & Iohn, although Christ preferred them almost before all, yet they tooke not the honour of primacie to them selues, but ordeined Iames (who was surnamed Iust,) 
                  
                     Episcopum Apostolorum.
                   
                  Bishop of the Apostles. This had béene a notable testimonie for Iames, against the primacie of Peter. But 
                     Chapt. 4. Diuision 2. I alleaged it not: because as I séeke to winne you to the truth, so I séeke to doo it by true and right meanes. Whereof this were none, being an ouersight (as it appeereth) of Rufinus. For in the Greeke Eusebius, it is, that they ordeined him 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  Bishop of Ierusalem, not Bishop of the Apostles.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               That may be the printers faute, or the scriueners perhaps, who wrote it out: not his who translated it.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But I thinke it rather the translators faulte. For Marianus Scotus doth cite out of Methodius the same touching Iames, that they ordeined him Bishop of the Apostles.
                  
                     Chron. lib. 2. Which (belike) was taken out of the storie of Eusebius doon into Latin by Rufinus. And he hath erred often in in turning Gréeke writers: as also his translation of Iosephus sheweth. Though I may not charge him with all the faultes therein. For where it is auouched by 
                     Sixt. Senen. biblioth. sanct. lib. 1. some that Iosephus holdeth the bookes of Maccabees to be holy scripture, as in déede he séemeth to doo 
                     In calce lib. de Maccabaeis.
                   in the Latin: in the Greeke he saith not any such thing, nay 
                     Iosephus aduersus Apion. lib. 1. he doth teach the contrarie; but it is vnlikely this came from Rufinus, 
                  
                     Rufin. exposit. Symb. Apost.
                   who helde him selfe the Maccabees not to be canonical. Howbeit if you say that the Gréeke copie which he translated of Eusebius, had that word amisse through the scriueners faulte: I will not striue against you. But a more certaine example of the faultinesse in scriueners first, and printers after, is found in 
                     Libr. 2. 
                  Optatus: in that he affirmeth, Peter was called Cephas because he was head of the Apostles; Apostolorum caeput Petrus, vnde & Cephas appellatus est. Upon the which place 
                     Fran. Balduin. Annot. in Optat.
                   your lawier doth note, that where he had thought it to be an ouersight of a man dreaming that the Syriake word, which singifieth a stone, is the Greeke 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which signifieth a head: now he ghessed rather that the words [unde & Cephas

appellatus est,] were some foolish glose, writen rashly in the margent, and then interlaced into the text by scriueners.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Like enough. But you haue no harme by this glose. For though you blot it out, yet Optatus saith that Peter was head of the Apostles.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Neither haue we any harme by that text. For I haue shewed 
                     Chapt. 5. Diuision 3. before it maketh nought for the Papacie. But we may haue harme by that kind of gloses: chiefely sith (as

                  The fathers them selues? With a very good will. But looke that you bring me the Fathers them selues. For, (which is my last exception, and so an ende,) there are many bookes entitled to Fathers which the Fathers made not: nay whereof sundry were made by such youthes, as are not worthy to beare the Fathers shooes. The workes of S. Ierom are abroade in nine volumes: of the which nine as good as three are none of his. And yet Vitae patrum, (a legend, how wrongfully fathered on S. Ierom your

                  Claudius Espencaeus doth maruel that Faber, a learned man, and witty, could be so perswaded: sith Peter in that storie is made to withdraw the Roman wiues & matrones from their husbands beddes vnder pretense of chastitie. Which vnchristian doctrine, repugnant to the lawes of godlinesse and honestie, nether was it possible that Peter should teach, neither is it likely that Linus should belye him with it. And thus you sée an autor disallowed by Espencaeus on very sound reason, whom Sixtus hath allowed of, not so discretely.

Whereof the first front, is, the names of them who liued three hundred yeares and vpwarde after Christ: but the names onely. For the writings sauour as much of those Bishops, as scarcrowes do resemble the strength of valiant men. The second front, are they who liued the next three hundred yeares, or there about. And the weapons (though not all) which they beare, are their owne: but those which are theire owne, are not long enough to reach the supremacie; and that which they doo reach they are to weake to winne it. The third, is as it were the forlorne hope: the Popes which doo folow the first and second front, in the vawarde, as you would say. And they haue best will, but can doo least. For they are troubled so with care of the cariage, and their whole artillerie of decrees, and decretals, and extrauagants is so dull, that, if the former be discomfited, they haue not power to strike a stroake. So that you sée, the witnesses, which you haue brought yet, are of no valure: haue you any better?

Your answere to the Popes whose autorities I cited doth stand on three pointes, according to thrée companies of them, as you sort them. The first, you say, are counterfeites, and most vnlike those Bishops whose names they take vpon them. The next auouch not the supremacie of the Pope: though they auouch more then is true, through affection.

it of the second too. And if I thought that the first (which séeme to haue beene counterfeited in the dayes of the third) had beene counterfeited and coined by some ambitious Pope himselfe: I would vse the same exception to them also.

For in style and Latin they might speake rudely, both to the entent that in thinges pertaining to the saluation of all euen the simplest might vnderstand them: and least they should séeme by choise of wordes to hunt for prayse and vaine glory. Yea, whereas the Centuries, in this point of style, doo note the likenesse of it too, as if that were a speciall marke to proue them counterfeit: therein they haue betrayed most notorious folly. For the style is wont to be a certaine token of the right autour (chiefly in some mens writings,) whereby we vse often to try and discerne a true booke from a forged; as learned men haue doon in Austin, Ierom, Ambrose, Cyprian, Tertullian, and others. But herein the tryall is the vnlikenesse of the style, betwene an autours owne worke and a bastard fathered on him. Which tryall can not bee had in those epistles of the Popes, that are denyed by the Centuries: because we haue nothing writen by those Popes, but onely those epistles. Now sée the blindnesse of heretikes. When they can not disproue them by vnlikenesse of style, they say that the likenesse of the style disproueth them: which is most ridiculous-

               Because that the style sometime is so peculiar to his owne autour, that his worke may thereby easily bee knowne euen by a man of meane iudgement: as in Tertullian, Apuleius, Plinie, Suetonius, and other such, not to recken vp all.

               Why? May not an other mans style be so like to Tertullians, or any such, that you shall not be able to discerne betweene them.
            
            
               Hart.
               It may be perhaps: but that is rare and harde. And therefore the learned man (whom you mentioned) 
                     De falsa librorum inscrip. biblioth. sanct. lib. 4. 
                  Sixtus Senensis, affirmeth, that of all the tokens, and coniectures, by which the right workes of autours may bee knowne from counterfeite and forged, the diuersitie of style doth seeme to be most sure and euident. For though it be easie for euery craftie coosiner to take vpon himselfe the countrie, and kinred, and times of any autour, and folow his pointes of doctrine too: yet there is nothing harder then to counterfeit an other mans style. By the style (saith he) I meane not that outward skinne of the wordes, but the shape of the oration, the frame of the speech, the ioyning and continuall order of the partes, the forme of eloquution, the figures of speaking, the arte of disposing, the methode of handling, & other thinges which are proper to euery well spoken autour. For as euery man hath a peculiar feature of bodie to himself, and a peculiar countenance, and a peculiar voyce, and a peculiar naturall coolour, and other seuerall markes whereby he doth differ from other men, and is vnlike them: so all ecclesiastical writers haue certaine properties peculiar to them selues, which neuer doo agree or seldome to any other: such, as is a gorgeous shew in Antiochus, an exquisite diligence of speech in Basil, a tragicall loftinesse in Gregorie Nazianzene, a cleane and vnforced elegancie in Chrysostome, a singular pure facilitie in Cyprian, a French-like statelines of vtterance in Hilarie, a graue and sharpe copiousnesse of briefe sayinges in Ambrose, in Ierom a florishing varietie of thinges & words, in Austin clauses ending like, and members falling like, in Gregorie a gate (as I may say) of sentences answering one an other in measures interchaungeably, and other thinges of

like sort, which although a man doo seeke of purpose to expresse, yet he cannot attaine vnto them. By the which words of Sixtus you may sée, that Turrian spake reason, in saying, that the style is commonly a sure token to discerne the right workes of autours from counterfeits.

               And by the same wordes of Sixtus you may sée, that he, in saying so, disproueth his owne reason, and proueth the reason of the Centuries. For the epistles of ye Popes which they endi

For it cannot be (say they) that so many Bishops should haue the same speech, no not though they had beene accustomed of purpose to likenes of style. And this is their reason of the likenes of style: which

Which could not be so, but that the styles of men haue their peculiar properties, wherein they differ each from other, as their bodies doo in feature, colour, voice, countenance, and other markes whereby we know them.

the middes of a Samaritan qualitie. For to proue that they could not disproue those epistles by vnlikenes of style, he saith that we haue nothing writen by those Popes, whose epistles they deny, but onely those epistles. Which is an vntruth. For one of the Popes, whose bastard epistles

Betwéene which epistles, the right ones in Cyprian, Eusebius, and Athanasius, and the bastard ones which are denyed by the Centuries, there is as great difference almost for the style: as there is for substance, betweene golde, and copper. Now by these few you may estéeme the rest: for they came all from one smithes forge. Wherefore not onely the likenes of the style, but the vnlikenes also conuinceth them of forgerie.

And shall we thinke that none of all the Doctors of that age did write for the instruction of the simplest too? Not Tertullian? Not Cyprian? Not Arnobius? Not Lactantius? Not Minutius Felix? Not Ierom, Ambrose, Austin? Or could they instruct them with cleane and true Latin, and could not the Popes? Nay, did other common Christians in Rome speake congruously, and purely, as we sée by their epistles and spéeches yet 
                     In Cyprian. epist. 3.26.30.31.46. & 50. extant: and was it a priuilege of the Popes alone to write barbarously? I will not deny but that the Popes in our daies may haue such prerogatiues: but I am perswaded that in times of olde they were as other common men. And therefore if you haue no better ground then Turrian, I shall continue my opinion that the Latin also and not the style onely is iustly noted by the Centuries, to proue, that the epistles whereof wee treate are counterfeit. Howbeit neither style, nor Latin, are the onely proofes that they bring for it. They haue more, and stronger.

                      7. they conclude that the ancient Popes were not autours of those epistles, because nether Eusebius, nor Ierom, nor Damasus, do make mention of them, nor any autour lightly before the time of Charles the great. Of the which argument, the former part is fond: the later, vntrue. For although Eusebius and Ierom are wont diligently to note what thinges haue béene writen by any great Doctor; yet not all mens writings came to their handes. As for Damasus, he writeth not so much the liues of the Popes his predecessours, as briefe Chronicle-notes: what place they were born in, what kinred they came off, in what time they liued, how often they gaue orders, in what yeare they died, and where they were buried. Wherefore it is no maruaile that hee noted not what epistles they wrote. Though in a writen copie at Rome (which

               Rainoldes.
               The comparison is vn-euen when you say, that the Popes them selues neuer saw bookes in their owne librarie,
                  
thereby to shew, that many bookes might be there, which Ierom and Eusebius knew not. For it is likely that the Popes haue many bookes which they sée not: they haue other thinges to looke on. But Eusebius and Ierom did study through libraries, to see all the autours which were extant in them. So that they were as likely to know the epistles of the former Popes, as Turrian these of the later. For Turrian doth not search olde monumentes more carefully to see vp the Pope, then Ierom and Eusebius did to set foorth Christ. But whatsoeuer Ierom or Eusebius saw: thinke you not that the Popes, as litle as they sée the bookes in their librarie, yet, if the sight of any thereof could auaile them toward the recouering of their supremacy in England, they would finde it quickly?

               Then haue the Centuries in this place of witnesses a very strong proofe, that (about the time of Ierom and Eusebius) these epistles were not in the Popes librarie. For there is no mention made of them at all either in

               Rainoldes.
               Of that it doth folow that the preface writen in Isidores name and set before the Councels to purchase credit to those epistles, is a counterfeit, and not Isidores. For in that preface there is mention made of the generall Councell of Constantinople held against Bishop Macarius, and Stephanus, in the time of Pope Agatho, & Constantine the Emperour. Which, séeing it was held aboue fourtie yeares after Isidore was dead by Genebrards owne confession: by his owne confession Isidore could not tell the foure score Bishops of it. And so the foure score Bishops which Turrian hath found out in one Isidore, are dissolued all into one counterfeit, abusing both the name of Isidore and foure score Bishops.

                  Igmarus who was Archbishop of Rhemes in the time of Lewes sonne to Charles, about seuen hundred yeares since, did thinke that worke to be S. Isidores, and so he citeth it.

               Hart.
               No: But to proue that the worke is Isidores (as Father

                  Ignarus can not proue that. He must be content to be deceiued in some what as well as his ancestors. For it is too cléere by the

                   Councels them selues that Isidore did dye about the time that we agréed of: and therefore no helpe, but it must be an other who wrote that preface in his name. Which maketh me so much the more to suspect that the epistles are counterfeit, sith I finde that a Father was counterfeited to get them credit. And sure it is likely that about the time of Charles the great, when the westerne Churches did commonly-fetch bookes

from the Roman librarie, some groome of the Popes (that had an eye to ye almes-box) conueied this pamphlet in amongst them: and well meaning men (in France, and other countryes) receyued it as a worthie worke, compiled by S. Isidore, and coming from the See Apostolike. But say what may be saide for the silence of olde witnesses, which is vrged, (and iustly,) as a probable coniecture, that those epistles were not extant in their dayes, the matters that are handled and debated in them, the scriptures alleaged, the stories recorded, the ceremonies mentioned, the times and dates assigned, are, not coniectures probable, but most certaine proofes, that they could not be writen by those ancient Bishops of Rome, whose names they beare. There is a booke entitled to the Poet 
                  
                     Ouidij Nasonis Pelignensis de vetula. Printed by Iohn of Lubecke, a citizē of Coolein in the yeare of Christ. 1479.

               Hart.
               What is that to the purpose? Doth he speake of the Popes epistles?
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               No: but their epistles are like to that booke in sundrie respectes. It is ancient: it was printed aboue a hundred yeares ago. And he, who set it foorth, saith that Ouid wrote it in his old age, and willed it to be laide vp in his graue with him: in the which graue it was found at length by the inhabitants of the countrey who sent it to Constantinople, and the Emperour gaue it to Leo his principal notarie, who did publish it. A smooth tale, to make men beleeue that it is Ouids. Of whom though it sauour no more, then these epistles of the Bishops of Rome: yet if your Diuines could finde some antike verse there that were an euidence for the Popes supremacie, I sée my former reasons would not disswade you from beléeuing but Ouid wrote the booke. For, to the barbarousnes and basenes of the Latin and style, if I should vrge it, you might answere that Ouid wrote so for two causes: that he might not séeme to be vaine gloriously giuen, and that his repentance might bee knowne euen to the simplest. To the silence of witnesses, that no man maketh mention of it amongst his workes, you might answere that it lay hidden in his graue. And this you might answere with greater shew of likelyhood, then that the Popes epistles lay hidden in the Popes librarie. But vnto the matters of which the booke intreateth, and thinges that it discourseth on, no shadow of defense can be made with any reason. For

                   prayeth to her. Which are pointes of doctrine that were not heard of (I trow) in Ouids time. Neither is it likely that Ouid was so well read in the scriptures, that he could 
                     De vetula l. 2. cite the 
                     Imbenedicibilem lex innuit illa spadonem Exemplo quodam famoso: nam spado, cum sit Voce Iacob, manibus non est Esau.

                  Salomon in Ecclesiastes. Euen so for those epistles of the Bishops of Rome, although you haue gloses to shift of other reasons: yet I am perswaded that you can lay no colour on the contents and substance of them. For the scriptures are so alleaged; and such pointes are taught about the gouernment of the Church, about religion, about rites, about stories ecclesiasticall, that it is not possible they should be writen by those Bishops.
            
            
               Hart.
               Why? Doo you thinke it as vnlikely a matter, that they should alleage the scriptures, as that Ouid should?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Nay, I doo thinke it, or rather I doo know it to be more vnlikely, that they should so alleage the scriptures as they doo, then that Ouid should allude to Salomon, or cite Moses. For 
                     Ioseph. antiquit. Iud. lib. 12. c. 2. the bookes of Moses (
                     Epiphan. lib. de mensur. & ponder.
                   perhaps of Salomon too) were translated into Gréeke by the Seuentie interpreters many a yeare before Ouid: and he might haue read them. But your common Latin translation of the olde testament, made (a great part of it) by S. Ierom out of the Hebrewe, (whence it is called S. Ieroms,) could not be séene by Anacletus and other auncient Bishops of Rome. For they were deceased before he was borne. And yet all their epistles doo alleage the scriptures after that translation. An euident token, that the writer of them did liue after S. Ierom: yea, a great while after him, as may bee déemed probably. For the common Latin translation, which the ancient Latin Fathers vsed, was made out of the Gréeke of the Seuentie interpreters. Tertullian, Cyprian, Hilarie, Ambrose, and other of the same ages, shew it in all their writings. Nether was that olde translation forsaken straight waies, as soone as Ierom had set forth his new. For 
                     De ciuit. Dei l. 18. c. 43. 
                  Austin, who saw Ieroms, preferred still the olde translation before it.

did preuaile, and the olde was wholy left: saue in the Psalmes onely, which being soong in Churches had taken déeper roote then could be plucked vp by Ierom. Now, sith those epistles of the Bishops of Rome doo alleage the scriptures after that translation which the Fathers called the new, 
                  
                     Concil. Trident. Session. 4. you call the olde, and it was so long after Ieroms time before that translation was growne to such credit that it had shut the other out: it is probable that they were writen long after, but whether long or short, it is certaine that they were writen after Ieroms time.
            
            
               Hart.
               It is true that Anacletus and the rest of those Bishops, who liued before S. Ieroms time, must néedes vse that translation which the Fathers call the olde. And so doth 
                     Pro epist. Pont. l. 5. c. 21. 
                  Turrian answere they did in these epistles.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The contrarie is plaine by the epistles themselues, in euerie one of them.
            
            
               Hart.
               I: but Turrian saith that when these epistles were first set abroad to the vse of the Church that they might come to all mens knowlege, then was it thought good (because S. Ieroms translation was in all mens hands) that many places, which were cited according to the other, should be changed and cited according to S. Ieroms translation.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But how doth Turrian proue that they were cited first according to the other?
            
            
               Hart.
               Because sundrie sentences, which in them are cited out of the Prophets, would better fit the purpose if they had béene cited according to the other which was out of the Gréeke, then according to S. Ieroms which is out of the Hebrewe. For example, in the first epistle of Pope 
                     Alexand. prim. ep. 1. ad omnes orthodoxos.
                   
                  Alexander, that text is alleaged out of the Prophet 
                     Zach. 2.8. 
                  Zacharie, He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye, as it is in Ierom. But the other translation out of the Gréeke should be, He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye: that is, of his owne eye, and not of Gods. In the which sort it had béene more fit for Alexander to cite it, as Turrian doth proue by the circumstances of the text. And the like he sheweth in two or thrée examples mo.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               And thereof he concludeth that the Pope did cite it so. As who say the Pope must needes doo that which was most fit.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, it doth not well agrée to his purpose, vnlesse he

did cite it so.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Whether it doo, or no: it is plaine that the autour meant not so to cite it. For in the same epistle he saith that Priests and Bishops (to whom he applieth it) are called the eyes of the Lord. Which sith he saith on those wordes, He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye: it séemeth that hée meant [eye] not of his eye who toucheth, but of Gods. Neither had he meant otherwise if he had cited the words after the Gréek translation, and not Ieroms. For though it be in Gréeke, He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye, (as it is in Hebrewe, and in the

                  ] is referred to [the Lord of hostes] whose care of his people the Prophet noteth by that spéech, in like sort as 
                     Deut. 32.10. 
                  Moses had also doon before him. Wherefore if it agree not well in that sense to the purpose and drift of the Popes epistle, in which it is alleaged, as Turrian saith it doth not: then himselfe confesseth that not all the scriptures are there alleaged fitly. Which 
                     Pro epist. Pont. l. 3. c. 13. and other where often. he cannot abide the Centuries should say. But if this answere be good and allowable, that when those epistles of the Popes were published, the textes, which could not be alleaged so by them, were chaunged: then is it impossible to bring any reason, but you may shield them from it easily. For if there be a point of order in discipline, or doctrine in faith, or the state of times, or circumstances of persons and things whatsoeuer, that is disproued by writers and witnesses of that age, as there are infinite: you may say that it was not so in the epistles, but they who set them forth did alter that point. For example, in one of them which is fathered on 
                     Epist. 2. ad Rufum aut Rusticum.
                   
                  Cornelius, appeales vnto the See of Rome are approued. But 
                     Epist 55. ad Cornelium. Statutum est omnibus nobis.
                   
                  Cyprian doth shew that Cornelius agreed with him and other Bishops, that causes should be ended where they began, without appeales.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               We shall neuer make an end if we stand on euerie particular that may be cauilled at. It sufficeth me that all which you can say is set downe in the Centuries, and that which they haue said is answered by Turrian. This is

                     M. Rishton.
                   who was present, told me he heard him say so. And I do the rather beléeue his report, because, whereas

                  Bellarmin him selfe hath set in writing the summe of those lectures, he saith though not altogether so much, yet in effect. For I will not deny (saith he) but there are some errours crept into them.

               Rainoldes.
               And why? because Isidore maketh mention of them. Which reason, that he therefore doth thinke them very ancient because there is mention made of them by Isidore, is as much in softer wordes, as if he saide, he thinketh them ancient, howbeit not so ancient as they are pretended. It may be that Bellarmin, if he were aduertised that Isidore is forged too, would thinke them lesse ancient by one degrée then yet he thought. But that which the Iesuit was loth to deale with ouer roughly: the Lawier, a man of better minde, and bolder spirit, doth plainely auouch. For he affirmeth it to be cléere and euident, that those epistles of the Popes, who were before Siluester, are all false and counterfeit. Now Siluester was Pope at the time of the Nicen Councell, aboue thrée hundred yeares after Christ. And so the exception which I made against your first band of Popes, who liued thrée hundred yeares after Christ, and vpward: you sée it is confirmed by a famous Lawier, a man of great iudgement, and of your owne religion.

                  the preface (wherin he brought those reasons) is not printed. Though I must cléere Plantin the printer from the faute. For I caused a friend of mine to aske of him, why it was not printed, and what became of it, whether a man might sée it or no. To whome he made answere, that the Censour, appointed to ouersee bookes to be allowed to the print, would not suffer it to passe; but what became of it, hee remembred not, nor knew how to procure it. They that doo euill, hate the light. There was somewhat in that preface, which the Censour would not that all men should see. But

Which consideration of a wise Oratour, the folly of your Censour hath proued to be true. For though he were bold enough to leaue out the preface of Contius: yet he had not craft enough to raze out that note which mentioneth the preface. And yet a litle after, (to sée the mischiefe of it how that should scape his handes,) he hath put in a note vnder Contius his name, which would haue helped well if he had razed out the other. For,

                  better proofe: specially sith they are found in all the courses of canons that are extant, collected 
                  
                     Ab Isidoro.
                   
                  by Isidore out of the booke of Damasus which was Bishop of Rome. This note was iuggled in well by the Censour, with this subscription, [Contius.] Pity, that he tooke not away the other note, where [Contius] is subscribed too.
            
            
               Hart.
               Why suspect you the Censour that he should make that note, and not Contius him selfe write it? You haue a lesson

in S. 
                  1. Cor. 13.7. 
                  Paul, that charitie is not suspicious.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  Charitie is not sottish neither: I learne that lesson of him too. For as it is a vice to suspect vniustly: so it is no vertue to beleeue vnwisely. And S. Paul, who saith that charitie beleeueth all thinges: yet beléeued not that 
                     Act. 23.16. 
                  they meant him well, of whom he vnderstood by his sisters sonne that they would lye in waite to kill him. Charitie beleeueth all thinges, which a wise and godly man should beléeue. But to beleeue that Contius wrote that note him selfe, were greater folly to the beleeuer, then charitie to the Censour. For how could it be that a learned man, the kinges professor of the law, should say concerning the same epistles, first, I haue shewed manifestly by many reasons that they are counterfeit: and anon, I know that some affirme them to be counterfeit; but I would desire them to bring better proofe. Chiefly sith the cause, that is added there why he desireth better proofe, is Isidores autoritie: 
                     Isidorus multa apocrypha & dubiae fidei inseruit.
                   whom

                   other, he mentioneth the proofe thereof made in his preface: yea, and that is more, vpon the same epistle of the same Anacletus, on which that counterfeit note was coyned, 
                     Distinct. 99. c. Prouinciae.
                   
                  Contius againe noteth, this epistle is falsely fathered on Anacletus, 
                  
                     Vt in praefatione monui.
                   
                  as I aduertised in my preface. Sée you not how rightly Tully did obserue, that if, either suttletie were bold, or boldnesse craftie, it would go hard with the truth? The truth which is oppugned by those epistles of the Popes should haue had one patrone lesse to speake for her, if your Censour had béene as politike to blot out the notes touching the preface, as he was hardie to leaue the preface out, and coine a new note against it. And yet perhaps he blotted out some notes too. But men, who deale with much, shall ouersée somewhat.
            
            
               Hart.
               You still suspect the worst. It might be the correctors faute and not the Censours. Or if the Censour did it, he did it of a good minde, because he thought that Contius was deceiued in it.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The likelyhood and presumption is not so much of the correctour, who vewing all the notes might haue left out

the rest too, if he had béene the dooer: as it is of the Censour, who suffering not the preface to passe to the print for the Popes sake, may iustly be suspected that he would straine an ynch farther to helpe the Pope. But, you say, he did it of a good minde. But good mindes must learne to vse good meanes also. At least, he should haue doon as Frier Surius did: who, whereas in the olde edition of the Councels there were certaine thinges noted out of Cassiodore, Marianus Scotus, and Gregorie Haloander, touching the yeares of the Consuls who are named in the dates of those epistles of the Popes: Surius (in his new edition thereof) hath left out all those notes, 
                     Praefat. ad sectorem. Conciliorum Tom. 1. yeelding this reason why hee left them out, because both the thing is darke of it selfe, & it is made more darke and intricate by their variance; in so much that Caluin seemeth on that occasion to haue reiected those epistles. In déede the Centurie-writers (whom Surius meant perhaps when he named Caluin) doo set downe that circumstance, of the yeare of the Consuls assigned in their dates, for a proofe that they be forged: and they confirme that proofe by those very notes that were set foorth with the epistles. For 
                     Cent. 3. cap. 7. 
                  many of the epistles haue the names of such Consuls, as neuer were Consuls together, or liued not then: 
                     Cent. 4. cap. 7. 
                  as appeereth by Marianus Scotus & others, yea, euen by the notes added to those epistles in the Tome of Councels. Which wordes might worke discredit to the Centurie-writers with them who sée the Councels in no edition but the last: for there are no such notes. And Surius, in leauing them out, hath answered well that reason of the Centurie-writers. Though he should haue answered it a greate deale better, if he had left out also the epistles them selues. For as long as they are extant: we shall not néede the notes vpon their dates to control them. Yet as he dealt wisely in leauing out the notes, so he shewed honestie in telling men of it: that they may know there were notes before, which impaired the credit of the epistles; and if they list to sée them, they may seeke and finde them too. But the Censour, who fell vpon the notes of Contius, hath shewed no such honestie. For neither hath he giuen any signification that he caused the preface to be left out; neither hath hee tolde vs of an other edition where it might be found; and, that which is the worst, he hath made Contius to speake in maintenance of that which him selfe

knew and had declared to be forged. All the which pointes it behooueth the iury to consider off; and not to weigh only the iudgement of Contius, or Bellarmin, or Cusanus, for the disproofe of those counterfeits on which you ground the Popes supremacie: but to thinke with them selues how many more of likelihood euen in the middest of Poperie haue spoken against them; yea, sundry peraduenture, who, (as their writings are printed now,) speake for them. For if in these dayes when men doo sift their dooings, Surius durst aduenture to leaue out notes already printed, and the Censour to suppresse things in printers hands that they may neuer come to light, yea, to write notes in the names of autours flat contrarie to their iudgement, & print them as their own too: what is it to be feared they did in former times, when there were few that would espie them? Or, if espie them, yet who so hardy to bewray them?
            
            
               Hart.
               The iudgement of Cusanus, and Bellarmin, and Contius, and the rest of our side, (if there were more who thought so,) may not disproue those epistles: séeing that themselues allow the supremacie of the Bishop of Rome.

               So much the greater force they haue to disproue them: sith it is not likely that they would leaue this hold of that, which they fauour, if manifest truth and reason did not compell them thereunto.

So plainely in sight, so greatly in weight, doo the later Popes differ from the former, in the chiefest point of their supremacie ouer all, and being subiect vnto no man.
            
            
               Hart.
               It may be that the Popes of the second sort would not, of modestie; or could not, for occasions, claime their ful supremacie.

               You should speake more truely and Christianly of them, if you said, they thought it not to be their right. But would not, or could not, your own answere graunteth that they did not claime it. Wherefore sith their supremacie implyeth soueraine power ouer kings and Emperours, as it is defined by the last sort of Popes: the second, who were subiect to the ciuill powers, and claimed no such soueraintie, auouched not the Popes supremacie.
            
            
               Hart.
               Yet ouer the spirituall powers they auouched it, that is, ouer Bishops. And that is more then you wil yéelde too.

               Yes, that they did: as you may sée by Pelagius.

                   when the question of the iurisdiction of Bishops and the Popes autoritie could not be well agreed on in the Councell of Trent, was called by the Pope to a consultation with the chiefest Cardinals. Where he spake his iudgement of the point so wisely, that it was thought fit his answere should be set in print. Therein, amongst many reasons and autorities for the Popes supremacie, he saith that Pelagius declared it by this decree, in that hee would haue all Metropolitans sworne to him.

                  This decree was made by a Popish Lawier, not by Pope Pelagius. For

Now, Franciscus Vargas, alleaging (as I ghesse) this text on Rufus credit, (though he name him not,) did mistake the matter; the rather, through a preiudice conceiued of the later times. For, that Metropolitans should professe Christ, it was a thing required then. But, that

               That they should be sworne to maintaine the Papacy,
                  
it is though a newer yet a néedfull order: least men should fall away from vnitie and obedience of the Sée of Rome. But thus much yet Pelagius decréed, as you graunt, that they should al make profession of their faith to him, & be allowed by his consent.

               Hart.
               Nay he saith, if any, if any Metropolitan send not vnto the See of Rome, to shew his faith, and receiue the pall: let him be depriued. Behold, he speaketh generally.

               So the States of England make their actes of Parlament: if any man doo this or that. Which yet they meane not of men in Rome and Turkie; but of all men within the Quéenes dominion.

               But the whole world is the Popes diocese.

So the rest of your proofes import an equalitie betweene all Bishops at the first, and afterwarde betweene all Patriarkes. The onely example that hath any kinne with the decrée of Pope Pelagius for his superioritie euer Metropolitans, is that out of Gregorie touching the Bishop of Salonae, 
                  
                     Gregor. lib. 2. indict. 11. ep. 8 
                  a Metropolitan citie in the countrie of Dalmatia. For 
                     Epist. 22. he was accustomed in déede to be confirmed by the consent of the Pope, as of his Archbishop, & 
                     Lib. 7. iudict. 2. epist. 81. to receyue a pall from him. But thereof to conclude that all Metropolitans throughout the whole world were likewise subiect to the Pope; it hath as much reason, as if you should

conclude that the Quéene of England appointeth Lieutenants throughout all Christendome, because she appointeth a Lord Deputie in Ireland. You are deceiued, M. Hart, if you thinke the Pope was swolne so bigge in the time of Pelagius. His dropsy had made him to drinke vp much, but not all. He was become Archbishop of a Princely diocese, but he was yet but an Archbishop. He was not vniuersal Pope, & Patriarke of ye whole world.
            
            
               Hart.
               Your speech is absurd, and doth confute it selfe, in séeking to confute the Pope. For if he had but a diocese, how was he an Archbishop? Sith a diocese is ye charge committed to a Bishop: an Archbishop, hath a prouince. And if he were but an Archbishop how had he Metropolitans vnder him? Whereas a Metropolitan, and an Archbishop, is all one. Beside that, you graunted him to be a Patriarke: for els the other Patriarkes must be his superiours, to whom you made him equall. So while you striue against him, and go about to bring him vnder, to bereue him of the supremacie: you speak as though you were bereft of sense and reason, and knew not what to say of him.

               In déed, as the names of [Archbishop] and [diocese] are vsed in our dayes, and haue beene of some writers in ancient times also: my spéech may séeme absurd, who say that the Pope was but Archbishop of a diocese, when he was Patriarke as I graunt. But after the language that was then receiued when the second sort of Popes were at the best, I speake the wordes of sense and reason.

                  Princely diocese, to distinguish it from a Lordly, that you might know I meant a diocese of a larger sise, then as the word is taken for a Bishops circuite. But that you may haue the cléerer light to sée the truth of mine answere, and thereby to perceue how the Pope encroched on Bishops by degrées, vntill of an equal he became a soueraine, first ouer a few, next ouer many, at last ouer all: I must fetch the matter of Bishops, Metropolitans, and Archbishops somewhat higher, and shew how Christian cities prouinces, and dioceses, were allotted to them. First therefore, when 
                     Act. 14.23. 
                  Elders were ordeined by the Apostles in euery Church,

                  feede the flocke of Christ, whereof the holy Ghost had made them ouerseers: they, to the intent they might the better doo it by common counsell and consent, did vse to assemble themselues and méete togither. In the which méetings, for the more orderly handling and concluding of things pertaining to their charge: they those one amongst them to be the President of their companie, and moderatour of their actions. As in the Church of Ephesus, though it had 
                     Act. 20.17. sundry Elders and Pastours to guide it: yet amongst those sundrie was there one chiefe, whom our Sauiour calleth 
                     Reu. 2.1. 
                  the Angel of the Church, and writeth that to him which by him the rest should know. And this is he whom afterward in the primitiue Church the Fathers called Bishop. For as the name of 1. Cor. 4.1.

                     Luk. 12.42. 
                  the stewardship of the mysteries of God, that is, in preaching of the gospell, is now by the custome of our English spéech restrained to Elders who are vnder a Bishop: so the name of 1. Tim. 3.2. Tit. 1.7. Act. 20.28. 
                  Bishop common to all Elders and Pastours of the Church, was then by the vsuall language of the Fathers appropriated to him who had the Presidentship ouer Elders. Thus are certaine Elders reproued by

But these new fangled names came in by your English translations of the new testament: which (as In the Annotations of the Rhemish Testament. Act. 14.22. our translation doth iustly note them for it) haue changed Priestes into Elders of falshood and corruption, and that of farther purpose then the simple can sée. Which is, to take away the office of sacrificing, and other functions of Priestes, proper in the new testament to such as the Apostles often, and the posteritie in maner altogither doo call Priestes, presbyteros. Which word doth so certainely imply the authoritie of sacrificing, that it is by vse made also the onely English of sacerdos, your selues as well as we so translating it in all the olde and new testament: though you cannot be ignorant that Priest commeth of presbyter, and not of sacerdos: and, that antiquitie for no other cause applied the signification of presbyter to sacerdos, but to shew that presbyter is in the new law, that which sacerdos was in the olde: the Apostles abstaining from this and other like olde names at the first, and rather vsing the wordes Bishops, Pastours, and Priestes, because they might be distinguished from the gouernours and sacrificers of Aarons order, who as yet in the Apostles time did their olde functions still in the temple. And this to be true, and that to be a Priest is to be a man appointed to sacrifice: your selues calling sacerdos alwaies a Priest must néedes be driuen to confesse. Albeit your folly is therein notorious, to apply willingly the word Priest to sacerdos, and to take it from presbyter, whereof it is deriued properly not onely in English but in other languages,

So, whereas the scripture doth teach that

                  one Priest, by

In saying whereof they doo play the Sophisters: and that with greater art then the simple can sée. Which is, in that they vse our English word [Priest] after a dooble sort: the one, as it is deriued from presbyter; the other, as it signifieth the same that sacerdos. For Priest, as it signifieth a man appointed to sacrifice, is 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  sacerdos, and not presbyter. The name which the Apostles giue a Minister of the gospell, is 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .

Which difference of wordes, necessarie to be obserued for the distinction of thinges betwéene the Ministers of the old and the new testament, as the Apostles kept it in the tongue in which the new testament is writen, so they who translated the testament into English were to kéepe it also. Wherefore it was not of falshood and corruption, but of religious zeale of truth, that they called presbyter, an Elder, not a Priest. For sith the custome of our English spéech hath made the name of Priest proper to a man appointed to sacrifice, such as were the

But you by confusion of these sundry names doo séeke confusion of the things: and as théeues are wont to change the markes of thinges which they haue stollen; so you, to make the Priesthood of Christ séeme your owne, doo change names, as markes of thinges which they signifie.

And you are to be borne with, if, hauing no better cause then they had, sometimes you aduenture on the shiftes that they did. But to abuse the credit of the Apostles to this sophistrie, and say that they gaue the name of Priestes to Pastours of the Church of Christ: that is a faulte that cannot be excused. For seeing our language doth meane by [Priests] sacrificers, which in their language are called

                  , whence our English name of Priests is deriued: yet you cannot say they called them Priestes, as the name of Priest hath a relation to sacrifice: and therfore that name is nothing to the Masse, which you would proue by it. For so the word [Priest] must yet haue two meaninges: the one of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the other of

                  . Wherof the one is giuen by the Apostles: but doth not implie autoritie to sacrifice. The other doth imply autoritie to sacrifice: but is not giuen by the Apostles,

As for the place of Esay, in which it is writen, you shall be called the Priests of God, the Ministers of our God shal it be said vnto you: the course of the text doth seeme to meane by Priestes all the seruants of God, whom 1. Pet. 2.5. 
                  Peter calleth an holy Priesthood, to offer vp spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Iesus Christ. For 
                     Esai. 61. uer. 1. the words are spoken as in Christes person to 
                     ver. 2. all the faithfull and repentant, 
                     ver. 3. who should be trees of righteousnes, 
                  
                     ver. 4. to build vp the Church: and thereupon are promised that 
                     ver. 5. their enimies shall serue them, and 
                     ver. 6. they shall serue God. But in an other place of Esay, (I graunt,) the name of Priest is giuen to Pastors and Elders: 
                     Esai. 66.21. where speaking of the calling and conuersion of the Gentiles, And of them (saith he) will I take for Priests, for Leuites, saith the Lord.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               
                  S. Ierom doth expound the former place of them also. But all is one to my purpose. For séeing that Pastours and Elders (as you terme them) are called Priests in scripture, and the name of Priest implyeth (you confesse) autoritie to sacrifice: it foloweth that Pastours and Elders are Priestes autorized to sacrifice. Now the Priest that hath autoritie to sacrifice, is he, whom you do call a Masse-priest. Wherefore both Masse and Priests are proued by the scripture.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Why? Thinke you that euerie Christian man and woman is a Masse-priest, because the name of 
                     Reu. 1 5. & 5.10. 
                  Priests is giuen them by scripture in respect of 1. Pe
                           •
                        . 2▪ 5. 
                  spirituall sacrifices which they must offer vnto God?
            
            
               Hart.
               No. Because the sacrifices that they must offer, are spirituall: and are called sacrifices by a borowed kinde of spéech, and not properly. But the sacrifice which is offered to God in

the Masse, is an external, visible, true, and proper sacrifice, as it is declared by 
                     Session. 22. c. 1. visibile sacrificium. c. 2. veré propitiatorium. can. 1. verum & proprium sacrificium.
                   the Councell of Trent. So that the Priestes ordeined to offer this sacrifice are properly called Priestes: wheras other Christians are called so improperly, according to the nature of the sacrifices which they offer.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then the name of Priestes alleaged out of Esay doth not proue your Masse-priestes. For he doth call the Ministers of the gospell Priestes, in respect of the spirituall sacrifices which they must offer. And that appéereth by 
                     Esai. 66.20. the words going next before: in which the Lord declaring (euen by S. Ieroms iudgement too) that he would call the Iewes to the same honour, that by the name of Priests is signified: and they (saith he) shall bring the Gentiles for an offering to the Lord, as the children of Israel offer in a cleane vessell in the house of the Lord. So to bring the Gentiles as an offering to the Lord, is that, for which they, who do bring such offerings, are named Priestes and Leuites.
                  
                     Comment. in ea verba Esaiae, Quomodo si inferant filii Israel munus.
                   But the offering vp of the Gentiles vnto him, is a spirituall sacrifice: made by the Ministers of Christ (as 
                     Rom. 15.16. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  Paule sheweth) when they conuert the Gentiles through the preaching of the gospell. The sacrifice therefore, in respect whereof the Ministers of the gospell are called Priestes by Esay, is a spirituall sacrifice. And as euerie faithfull person is a Priest, because we must offer, each his owne bodie, 
                     Rom. 12.1. 
                  a liuing sacrifice, holy, acceptable vnto God: so that name is giuen to Ministers of the gospell, because they are called to offer vp the bodies of other men in like sort. Wherefore if priuate Christians are not Masse-priestes, because their sacrifices are spirituall: then sith the Ministers must offer vp the like sacrifices, it foloweth by your answere that nether they are Masse-priestes.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               The Ministers of the gospell must offer vp the like sacrifices: I deny it not. And in that respect it is true, that nether they, nor priuate Christians are proued to bee Masse-priestes. But there is an other, an externall sacrifice, that Ministers must offer also: euen that which our Lord in the prophet Malachie doth call 
                     Mal. 1.11. 
                  a cleane oblation, and saith that in euerie place it is sacrificed and offered to his name, because his name is great among the Gentiles. And that is the sacrifice, in respect whereof the Ministers of the gospell are called Priestes properly, and are indéede Masse-priests. For the cleane oblation is the

sacrifice of the Masse, wherein the body and blood of Christ is offered vp vnto God his father, as 
                     Concil. Trid. Sess. 22. cap. 1. the Councell sheweth, an oblation that cannot be defiled by the vnworthines or wickednes of them who offer it.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               What? And be your Priestes of the tribe of Leui, who offer vp this sacrifice?
            
            
               Hart.
               No syr, nor of the Iewes: but they are Christian Priestes.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But they, who must offer the sacrifice that is spoken of in the prophet Malachie, are of the tribe of Leui. For afterward 
                     Mal. 3.3. entreating of 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   ye same oblation, or offering (as we cal it,) that shall be offered vnto God in the time of the gospell, he saith that the Lord shall fine the sonnes of Leui, and purifie them as gold, and siluer, that they may offer an offering vnto God in righteousnes. Wherefore if the offering that Malachie doth speake of, be the sacrifice of the Masse, that is, a sacrifice properly: then the proper Priestes, by whom it is offered, are the Iewish Priests after the order of Aaron, euen the sonnes of Leui. But if the sonnes of Leui betoken (by a figure) the spirituall Leuits, that is, all the faithfull, whom Christ in the new testament hath made 1. Pet. 2.9. 
                  a royall Priesthood, 
                  
                     Reu. 1.6. 
                  euen Kings and Priestes to God his father, as your 
                     Arias Montanus comment. in Malach. c. 3. 
                  Montanus well expoundeth it: then must the offering (by a figure) signifie the spirituall sacrifice, which Christians of all sortes are bound to offer vnto God. And in truth, as 
                     Matt. 11.14. 
                  Christ said of Iohn Baptist, If you will receiue it, this is Elias which was to come, meaning, that 
                     Mal. 4.5. the Prophet did signifie Iohn Baptist by the name of Elias: so I may say to you touching the spirituall sacrifices of Christians, If you will receiue it, this is the cleane offering which should in euery place be offered to the Lord. For the Prophets, when they spake of the gospell of Christ, and the religious worship of God 
                     Ioh. 4.23. 
                  in spirit and truth, (which Gentiles conuerted by the preaching of the gospell should serue him in, through all the world:) are wont to describe it by figuratiue spéeches drawen from the externall and carnall worship of God in the ceremonies of the law. So they say that 
                     Esai. 19.19. 
                  there shall be an altar of the Lord in the middes of the land of Egypt; that 
                     Esai. 56.7. 
                  God will accept the burnt offrings and sacrifices of straungers vpon his altar; that 
                     Esai. 60.
                        •
                     . 
                  all the sheeepe of Kedar shall be offefered

on it, and the rammes of Nebaioth; that 
                     Zac. 14. ver. 16 
                  the Gentiles shall go vp to keepe the feast of tabernacles from yeare to yeare 
                  
                     ver. 17. 
                  vnto Ierusalem, and 
                  
                     ver. 21. 
                  euery pot in Ierusalem and Iuda shall be holy to the Lord of hostes, and all they who sacrifice shall come & take of them and seeth therein; finally, that 
                  
                     Mal. 3.4. 
                  the offering of Iuda and Ierusalem shalbe sweete vnto the Lord, as in the dayes of old and in the yeares afore. Wherefore, as the Prophets doo mention an offering which the Christian Church shall offer vnto God in the time of the gospell: so doo they mention burnt offeringes, and sacrifices, the sheepe of Kedar, the rammes of Nebaioth, to bee offered on an altar; they mention Ierusalem to bee gone vnto, the feast of tabernacles to be kept, the flesh of beastes sacrificed to be sodde in pottes, the Leuites to be the Ministers who shall make the offering in righteousnesse to God. But neither doth 
                     Heb. 7.1
                        •
                     . the Priesthood of the Leuites continue, neither is 
                     Ioh. 4.21. 
                  Ierusalem the place to worship God, neither are 
                     Gal. 4.10. the Iewish feastes the times to doo it, nor will he be serued 
                     Heb. 10.
                        •
                     . with sacrifice, and offering, if they be taken properly. The Prophets therefore meant by an allegorie (as we terme it) to shew that all Christians should, as Priests, and Leuites; offer vp them selues, and theirs, as sacrifices; at all times, as solemne feastes; in all places, as in Ierusalem. And so the cleane offering, whereof the Prophet Malachie saith it shalbe offered in euery place vnto the Lord, doth signifie not a sacrifice to be made vpon an altar, as your 
                     Concil. Trident. Sess. 22. cap. 1. Councell would haue it, but the spirituall sacrifice which S. 
                  1. Tim. 2.8. 
                  Paul exhorteth the faithfull to offer, when he willeth men to pray in euery place, lifting vp pure handes without wrath & douting.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               The Prophetes speake much in déed of thinges to come not properly, and simply, but figuratiuely, by obscure spéeches, and allegories, and parables, that must be vnderstood otherwise then they are writen as 
                     Aduers. Marcion. lib. 3. 
                  Tertullian noteth. But the name of altar is vsed properly for a materiall altar by the Apostle to the Hebrewes, saying, 
                     Heb. 13.10. 
                  we haue an altar whereof they haue not power to eate which serue the tabernacle. For he putteth them in minde by these wordes, that in folowing too much their olde Iewish rites they depriued themselues of an other maner & a more excellent sacrifice and meate: meaning, of the holy altar, and Christes owne blessed body offered and eaten there. Of

which they that continue in the figures of the old law could not be partakers. This altar (saith 
                     In Leuitic

                   Hebrew answering thereunto in the old testament) signifieth properly an altar to sacrifice on, and not a metaphoricall and spirituall altar. Wherefore séeing that we haue a very altar in the proper sense, and the name of altar doth import a sacrifice that is offered on it: it foloweth that the body of Christ vpon the altar is a very sacrifice in the proper sense. And that out of doubt is the cleane offering which the Prophet speaketh of: according as the Councell of Trent hath defined.

               And are you out of doubt that by the wordes, we haue an altar, the Apostle meaneth a materiall altar, such as your altars

               Rainoldes.
               Is it so? Then the worde [altar] is not taken for a very altar in the proper sense, but figuratiuely for the body of Christ the which was sacrificed and offered. Neither is it taken for the body of Christ, in that respect that Christ is offered in the sacrament, in the which sort he is That is to say, not in the truth of the thing, but in a mysterie betokening it, as it is n

               Hart.
               Nay, the auncient Father Isychius expoundeth it of the bodie of Christ in the sacrament, (as I shewed) which the Iewes must not behold. They might behold his body vpon the crosse, and did so.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But the holy Apostle him selfe doth vnderstand it of the bodie of Christ as it was offered on the crosse. And that is manifest by the wordes he addeth to shew his meaning touching the Iewes and the altar. 
                  
                     Hebr. 13.11. 
                  For (saith he) the bodies of those beastes, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high Priest for sinne, are burnt without the campe. Therefore euen Iesus, that he might sanctify the people with his owne blood, suffered without the gate. Which wordes are somewhat darke, but they will be plaine, if we consider both the thing that the Apostle would proue, and the reason by which he proueth it. The thing that he would proue, is, that the Iewes can not be partakers of the fruite of Christes death and the redemption which he purchased with his pretious blood, if they still retaine the ceremoniall worship of the law of Moses. The reason by which he proueth it, is an ordinance of God in a kinde of sacrifices appointed by the law to be offered for sinne, which sacrifices shadowed Christ, and taught this doctrine. For whereas 
                     Leu. 6.16. & 7.6. the Priestes who serued the tabernacle in the ceremonies of the law, had a part of other sacrifices and offeringes and did eate of them: 
                     Leu. 4.3. & 16.15. there were certaine beastes commanded to bee offered for sinne in special sort, and their blood to be brought into the holy place, 
                  
                     Leu. 6.30. whose bodies might not be eaten, but must be burnt without the campe. Now, by these sacrifices offered so for sinne, our onely soueraine sacrifice Iesus Christ was figured: who 
                     Heb. 9.12. 
                  entred by his blood into the holy place, 
                  1. Ioh. 1.7. & 2.2. to clense vs from all sinne; and 
                     Ioh. 19.20. his body was crucified without the gate, that is, the gate of the citie of Ierusalem; and they who keepe the Priestly rites of Moses law, can not 
                     Ioh. 6.51. 
                  eate of him, that by his death they may liue: for none shall liue by him who séeke to be saued by the law, as it is writen, 
                     Gal. 5.1. 
                  if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. The Apostle therefore exhorting the Hebrewes 
                     Heb. 13. ver. 
                     
                        •
                     
                   to stablish their hartes with grace, that teacheth them to serue the Lorde in spirit and truth after the doctrine of the gospell, not with meates, that is to say, with the ceremonies of the law, a part whereof was the

difference betweene vncleane and cleane in meates: doth moue them to it with this reason, that 
                     ver. 10. if they serue the tabernacle, and sticke vnto the rites of the Iewish Priesthood, their soules shall haue no part of the foode of our sacrifice, no fruit of Christs death. For, 
                     ver. 11. as the bodies of those beastes which were offered for sinne, and their blood brought into the holy place by the hye Priest, might not be eaten by the Priestes, but were burnt without the campe: 
                  
                     ver. 12. so neither may the keepers of the Priestly ceremonies haue life by feeding vpon Christ, who (to shew this mystery) did suffer death without the gate, when he shed his blood to clense the people from their sinne. And thus it appeereth by the text it selfe that the name of altar betokeneth the sacrifice, that is to say, Christ crucified: not as his death is shewed foorth in the sacrament, but as he did suffer death without the gate. Whereby you may perceiue, first, the folly of your Rhemists about the Greeke worde, (as also the Hebrew) that it signifieth properly an altar to sacrifice on: as though it might not therefore be vsed figuratiuely; where yet them selues must needes acknowledge it to be so too. Next, the weakenes of your reason, who thereof doo gather, that, by the sacrifice, which that worde importeth in the Apostle, is meant the cleane offering of which the Prophet speaketh. For, the cleane offering, of which the Prophet speaketh, is offered 
                  
                     Mal. 1.11. 
                  in euery place: the sacrifice meant by the Apostle, in one place onely, 
                     Heb. 13.12. 
                  without the gate. Wherefore the name of altar in the epistle to the Hebrewes doth neither signifie a Massing-altar, nor proue the sacrifice of Massing-priests.

               The note of your Rhemists, about the Greeke & Hebrew word, is true (I graunt,) yet foolish too: though true in the thing, yet foolish in the drift. For to the intent that where the Apostle saith, we haue an altar, it may be thought hee meant not that word spiritually, or in a figuratiue sense, as we expound it of Christ, but materially of a very altar such as is vsed in their Masses: they say that the 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  Greeke word (as also the

Which spéech how dull it is in respect of the point to which they apply it: I will make you sée by an example of their owne. Our Sauiour in the gospell teacheth of himselfe that he is

                  Rhemists doo note hereon, that the person of Christ incarnate is meant vnder the metaphore of bread, and our beleefe in him is signified by eating. Wherein they say well. But if a man should tell them that the

Yet how wise to the purpose, who is so blinde that séeth not? Yea, to go no farther then the very word, whereof by their Hebrew and Greeke they séeke aduantage: them selues, vpon that place of

Christe (say they) as man, no dout is this altar. They meane it (I hope) in a metaphoricall, or other figuratiue spéech. For they will not make him by transsubstantiation to be an altar properly. Yet here it is as true that the

text of the scripture where Christ is called bread, yea the true bread, would proue the one cléerely, as they could fit it with this note; and the word altar, would put the other out of controuersie, chiefely if that were noted withall, that

Wherefore this plaister will not helpe the weakenes of your muddy wall, I meane of the conclusion which you would proue by it and doo inferre vpon it, that we haue an altar in the proper sense to sacrifice Christes body vpon. In the daubing vp whereof yet your plaisterers do shew a péece of greater art: partly, by drawing vs into hatred who haue not Popish altars, but communion tables; partly, by winding the names of Fathers in, as if they made for you against vs. Both, with skill and cunning: but more of sophistrie, then diuinitie.

And howsoeuer you auoide the place of S. Paule, where it is said, we haue an altar: the prophecie of Malachie, that in euery place there is sacrificed and offered a cleane offering to God, must néedes belong to the verie and outward sacrifice of the Masse, not to spirituall sacrifices. Which because that reuerend man, D▪ Allen, whose treatise of the Masse is such a moate in your eye,

But when it is said, the sacrifice of praise, the sacrifice of crying, the sacrifice of contrition, and the like: it is perceiued easily by the wordes annexed that they be taken improperly. Secondly, this sacrifice, of the which the Prophet speaketh, is one: but spirituall sacrifices there are so many as there are good workes of Christian religion. Thirdly, this is the proper and peculiar sacrifice of the new law, and the Gentiles, not of the Iewes. But spirituall sacrifices of praiers and workes are common to the Iewes with vs. Fourthly, this that Malachie meaneth doth succéede the sacrifices of the Iewes, and is offered in their stéede: but praier, fasting, and the workes of charitie doo not succéede any, but are ioined and coopled to euerie kinde of sacrifices. Fifthly, our workes (chiefely in the iudgement of heretikes) are defiled, howsoeuer they séeme beautifull: but this Prophetical offering is

                   cleane of it selfe, and so cleane of it selfe in comparison of the olde sacrifices, that it cannot be polluted anie way by vs or by the woorst Priests. For here, in our testament, they cannot choose all the best to them selues, and offer to the Lord for sacrifice the féeble, the lame, and the sicke, as before in the old: because there is now one sacrifice so appointed, that it cannot be chaunged; so cleane, that no worke of ours can distaine it. Finally, the Fathers, and all that euer haue expounded this place of purpose catholikely, haue expounded it of the sacrifice of the Masse: yea then, when they speake of the sacrifice of praier, yea or

of spirituall sacrifice. Wherein the heretikes deceiue and are deceiued. For the Fathers call our sacrifice some times an offering of prayer, and a spirituall sacrifice, because it is made with blessing and with prayer mysticall: because 
                     Victima hic existens.
                   the victime that is here, hath not a grosse, carnall, and bloody consecration or sacrification, as had the victimes of the Iewes. Sée Tertullian in the third booke against Marcion, in the end; Iustin, in Trypho; Irenaeus, in the fourth booke, the two and thirtieth chapter; Ierom, on the eighth of Zacharie; Austin, in the first booke against the aduersarie of the law, and the eightenth chapter; albeit in the second booke against the letters of Petilian he doth expound it of the sacrifice of prayse: Cyprian also, in the first booke the sixtenth chapter against the Iewes; Cyrill, in the booke of worshipping in spirit and truth; Eusebius, in the first booke of preparation of the gospell; Damascen, in the fourth booke of the Catholike faith, and the fourtenth chapter; Theodoret, vpon the first chapter of Malachie. Thus farre D. Allen. By whom you may perceiue, that we bring the right opinion of the Fathers, with many other reasons out of the circumstances of the text it selfe, to proue that the cleane offering in the Prophet Malachie doth signifie the sacrifice of the blessed Masse.

               Nay, I may perceiue that D. Allen bringeth the names of the Fathers, though Damascen a childe in respect of the rest, farre in yeares beneth them, & farther in iudgement; but their names he bringeth, he bringeth not their right opiniō. For if their opiniō be searched & examined, it maketh nothing for him. And therfore he doth onely name them & quote them. Which point of his wisdome your Rhemists folow much. Many other reasons he bringeth, I graunt, besides the names of Fathers: but it had béene better for him not to bring them. For Tertullian, Iustin, Irenaeus, Ierom, Austin, Cyprian, Cyrill, Eusebius, Damascen, and Theodoret, would make a faire shew with their names alone, if the other reasons and they were set a sunder. Now, being matched in a band together, and agréeing no better then

                  incense offered to my name, and a cleane offering. Now the worde [incense] is vsed in the scripture simply for prayers, in the fifth chapter of the Reuelation: where

                  the golden vials of the foure and twentie Elders are full of

                  odours, or incenses (to keepe the worde,) which are the prayers of the Saintes. And so doo

Wherefore the first reason which you rehersed of D. Allens, that the worde [to sacrifice] being vsed by it selfe without a terme abridging it, is taken in the scripture alwayes properly for the act of outward sacrifice, is false, both in it selfe, and by the iudgement of the Fathers. For that worde of his, is incense in the Fathers according to the scripture. But incense in the scripture is taken for prayers figuratiuely. By the iudgement therefore and exposition of the Fathers, that worde doth not inferre the sacrifice of the Masse, but our spirituall sacrifices.

               In déede S. Iohn expoundeth in the Apocalypse those odours to be the prayers of the Saintes. But thereby it is plain (as In the Rhemish Annot. on the Apocalyp. 5.8. we note vpon it) that the Saintes in heauen offer vp ye prayers of faithfull and holy persons in earth (called here Saintes, and in the scripture often) vnto Christ. And among so many diuine and vnserchable mysteries set down without exposition, it pleased God yet, that the Apostle him selfe should open this one point vnto vs, that these odours be That is to say, the prayses. the laudes and prayers of the faithfull, ascending and offered vp to God as incense, by the Saintes in heauen. That so you may haue no excuse of your errour, that the Saintes haue no knowledge of our affaires

or desires.

               You are too too flitting on euery occasion from the present point in question to others. And yet, if we should enter into that controuersie about the worship of Saintes: that honour which you giue them would finde no succour here. For neither doth it follow that we must pray to them though they did offer vp our prayers; neither is it certaine, that the Saintes in heauen onely are represented in the foure and twentie Elders; neither, if they be, can you proue that the prayers of Saintes, which they offer, are other mens prayers, they may bee their owne. And for my part I doo rather thinke that the foure and twentie Elders represent all the Saintes and faithfull both in heauen and earth, who offer vp their owne prayers as incense to God. For after that S. Iohn had saide that 
                     Reu. 5. ver.

                  the odours are the prayers of the Saintes: he addeth, that

By the which wordes it seemeth that he openeth what the prayers are which they offer to Christ. And sith they, who offer them, doo say of them selues that Christ hath made them Kinges and Priests, which S. Iohn 
                  
                     Reu. 1.6. before affirmeth of the Saintes on earth: it may be that they also, and not the Saintes in heauen onely, are represented by the foure and twentie Elders.

                  the foure and twentie Elders are described with golden crownes vpon their heads. And the crowne is giuen to Saintes in heauen, as it is writen: 
                     Reu. 2.10. 
                  Be thou faithfull vntill death, and I will giue thee the crowne of life.

                  a crowne, or (as we speake) a garland, by allusion to a custome that was among the Grecians. For such as got the masterie in their games of wrastling, or running, or the like, were

                  crowned with a garland in token of victorie. Whereupon the scripture (by a figure of spéech) doth call life eternall, wherewith God rewardeth the conquerours, the crowne of life:

                  not a corruptible crowne, as those of the

Grecians were, but incorruptible, 
                  1. Pet. 5.4. 
                  a crowne that can not wither, euen a crowne of glory. And as the crowne is taken in this sense for a garland, to signify the blisse of endlesse life and ioy: it is giuen onely to the Saintes in heauen, who 
                     Reu. 14.13. 
                  rest from their labours. But the foure and twentie Elders had golden crownes set vpon their heads; and 
                     Psal. 23.3. 
                  a crowne of gold betokeneth a kingdome. Wherefore sith the Saintes on earth are kinges also, and not the Saintes in heauen onely: the foure & twentie Elders may signifie them both. As it is both their duties 
                     Reu. 4. ver. 10 to cast their crownes before the throne, and say to him who sitteth on it, Thou art worthie O Lord to receiue glory, and honour, and power: for thou hast created all thinges, and for thy willes sake they are, and were created.

               But they are saide also to be 
                     ver. 4. 
                  clothed in white raiment. And the white raiment is vsed to betoken the brightnesse of glory, wherewith the Saintes in heauen are clad. For 
                     Reu. 3.4. Christ doth pronounce of the godly in Sardis, that they shall walke with him in white: and when vpon the mountaine 
                     Luk. 9.29. 
                  his clothes were white glistering, it was a token of his glory.

               But as white raiment doth betoken glory, so doth it grace too. For 
                     Reu. 3.18. our Sauiour aduiseth the Church of the Laodiceans to buye of him white raiment, that she may bee clothed, and that her filthie nakednesse doo not appeere. And 
                     Reu. 7.14. the scripture sheweth touching the faithful of al tongues, and peoples, and kinreds, and nations, that they had washed their robes and made their robes white in the blood of the Lambe. Wherefore sith no more is saide of the Elders but that they were in white raiment: it may as wel agrée to the Saintes on earth, who are in white of grace; as to the Saintes in heauen, who are in white of glory.

                     Heb. 3.1. 
                  the hye Priest of our profession, 
                  
                     Mal. 3.1. 
                  the Angell of the couenant, 
                  1. Tim. 2.5. 
                  the onely mediator betweene God and man. And this doth séeme to be that Angel, that other Angell, of whom it is writen in the Reuelation, 
                  
                     Reu. 8.3. 
                  An other Angell came and stoode before the altar hauing a golden censer, and there was much odours giuen vnto him that he should put them into the prayers of all the Saintes on the golden altar which is before the throne: and the smoke of the odours, which were put into the prayers of the Saintes, went vp before God out of the Angels hand. For although the Angels be 
                     Heb. 1.14. 
                  ministring spirites, sent forth to minister for the Saints on earth, who shall inherite saluation, and therefore as 
                     Act. 10.4. they serue to certifie them that their prayers are come vp before God, so they might rather offer their prayers to God, then the Saintes in heauen, who haue no such ministery to serue the Saintes on earth: yet because this Angell standing with a censer at the altar of incense to burne perfume before God, is set forth as dooing that duetie, 
                     Exod. 30.7. Leu. 16.12. which the hie Priest did figure in the law; and 
                     Heb. 7.27. our hye Priest is, no created Angel, but he 
                     Col. 1.16. by whom the Angels were created, euen Christ; it foloweth that Christ is meant by the Angell. To whom this name is giuen oftentimes in 
                     Gen. 48.16. Exod. 14.19. Esai. 63.9. Mal. 3.1. scripture, because he is an Angel, that is to say, a messenger, sent by God his father to open his will vnto his seruants, and worke their saluation by his couenant. And it may be, that, as God the father 
                     Exod. 23. ver. 20. hauing said of him, Behold I send an

Angell, 
                  
                     ver. 21. doth adde, my name is in him, to shew that he is 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      as he is also called Exod. 13.21. 
                  God: so, to distinguish him from the created Angels, who are often mentioned in the Reuelation, S. Iohn doth cal him an other Angell, as differing from the rest, not onely in number, but also in nature, autoritie, and dignitie. For those things which are writen of the Angell, who 
                     Reu. 7.2. 
                  had the seale of the liuing God; who 
                     Reu. 8.5. 
                  casting fier into the earth the Angels blew their trumpets, and powred out the plagues of God: who 
                     Reu. 10.1. 
                  comming downe from heauen, clothed with a clowde, and the rainebow vpon his head, and his face was as the sunne, & his feete as pillers of fier, had in his hand a little booke, & set his right foote on the sea, and his left foote on the lande; which are namely written of an other Angell, an other mightie Angel, as he is also called: doo (if the circumstances of the text be weighed) best agrée to Christ. But whether it be so, or no: it is certaine that Christ is the Angell who putteth odours of most sweete perfume into the prayers of all the Saintes, as our hye Priest, and offreth them to God his father, to whom 
                     Heb. 7.25. 
                  he maketh alwayes intercession for vs, and is not onely for our prayers but for our selues also 
                     Eph. 5.5. 
                  an odour of a sweete smelling sauour before him. Wherefore sith the scripture manifestly sheweth that our Sauiour Christ offreth the prayers of all the Saintes, and not that the Saintes in heauen offer the prayers of the Saintes on earth: you might haue bene contented to leaue this honour vnto Christ, and haue suffred me to go forward with your reasons about the offering in Malachie. For you see how we are fallen from the Pope to Priests, from Priests to the Masse, from Masse to the Saintes. And if I should folow the same veyne on that which you haue saide of Saintes, and touch your abuse, who confessing that the scriptures giue that name to faithfull and holy persons in earth, yet (to maintaine your solemne inuocation of dead men) do make it proper, not to Saintes in heauen, but to them whom it shall please

thus from point to point on euery occasion that your speech doth offer, we should confound our conference, and neuer make an end of the point in question. Wherefore let other questions I pray be reserued to their due place touchinge the faith of the Church. And now, to finish this touching the head of the Church, let vs go forward with your Masse-priestes, that so we may returne to the Popes supremacy. Of the sixe reasons therfore which you alleaged out of D. Allen, to proue, that the cleane offring which Malachie doth write of is the sacrifice of the Masse, and not spirituall sacrifices: the first is conuinced clearely to be false, and that by the consent of all the same Fathers whom he would proue it by. For 
                     Sacrificatur.
                   the word, which noteth an outward sacrifice with him, with all them is 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      the Greeke Fathers, in the Latin, a word answering thereto: as incensum, August. contr. aduers. leg. l. 1. cap. 20. or odores incensi, Cypr. contr. Iudaeos l. 1. c. 16. 
                  incense of sweete perfumes and odours. But incense in the scripture is taken for the praiers of the Saintes as you grant. The word then which he doth build the Masse vpon, is not alwayes taken properly in scripture for the act of outward sacrifice.
            
            
               Hart.
               But he doth not onely vrge the word, to sacrifice, for which indéede the Fathers and the Hebrewe text haue incense: but the word, to offer. And if that be alwaies taken properly for the act of outward sacrifice: his reason is of force still.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But the force of his reason doth lye vpon the word, to sacrifice, not to offer. For 
                     Alan. de Euchar. sacrific. cap. 16. him selfe granteth that lay men, yea women too, are said to offer properly and truely: when, as in 
                  
                     Deut. 12.17. & 14.23. & 26.10. 
                  the olde law the tithes and first fruites commanded to be giuen to the Leuites and the poore were presented before God; so they present bread and wine for the communion, or almes for the reliefe of the poore and needy, or any earthly giftes and offerings for holy vses, as

                  the Fathers shew. Wherefore though the word, to offer, were alwaies taken properly for the act of outward offering: it proueth not the offering of your outward sacrifice: sith 
                     Matt. 2.11. 
                  the wise men offered giftes vnto Christ, 
                  
                     Matt. 5.24. the faithfull Iewes at the altar, 
                  
                     c. Omnis Christianus. de consecration. distinct. 1. lay men and women at the Masse; and yet nether any of them were Massing-priests, nor their offerings, Massing-hosts. Much lesse doth it proue it, as Malachie applyeth it to the offering of incense. For, as incense signifieth the prayers of the Saintes: so to offer incense must be to sacrifice those prayers. But the sacrifice of prayers is a spirituall sacrifice. Wherfore the word to offer, doth not proue your outward sacrifice of the Masse.

And so the first reason is gone. The second foloweth: which is no sounder then the former. For why doth Allen say, that the sacrifice spoken of in Malachie is one: and therefore betokeneth not spirituall sacrifices, the which are as many as there are Christian good workes?
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Why? Because the text of the Prophet Malachie saith that there is offered a cleane oblation, or offering, as you call it. And offering is spoken of one, not of many. For els he should haue saide, offerings, not offering.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               So. And doo you thinke that he who said to God, 
                     Psalm. 40.7. Heb. 10.5. 
                  sacrifice & offering thou art not delited with, or (as you translate it) host and oblation thou wouldest not: did meane the Masse by that host?
               
            
            
               Hart.
               
                  The Masse? No. He meant the hostes and oblations of the old law. For they are the wordes of the Prophet Dauid, spoken of the legall and carnall sacrifices of the Iewes.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  The Iewes? Nay: the text of the Prophet Dauid saith that God mislyked host and oblation; it saith not, hostes and oblations. Wherefore sith he speaketh of one, not of many; and the carnall sacrifices of the Iewes were many, but the sacrifice of the Masse is one, as you say: it séemeth he should meane that. A point some what dangerous for the host, which your Priests lift vp to be adored. More dangerous for them, who liue by lifting it vp.
            
            
               Hart.
               Our adoration of the host is good, in spite of all heretikes, and not reproued by the Prophet. For, although he saith, host and oblation thou wouldest not: yet is it plaine he meaneth the sacrifices of the Iewes by 
                     Synecdoche.
                   a figure of spéech, in which a part is vsed for the whole, and one for many; as host, and oblation, for hostes, and oblations.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then Allens second reason is not worth a shoobuckle to proue that the sacrifice of ye Masse is meant by the oblation in Malachie. For the word 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  oblation, or offering, which he vseth in his owne language, is vsed likewise still, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      onely in the singular number, and neuer 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in the plurall. as of one, not as of many, through all the olde testament. Wherefore if the sacrifices of the Iewes were many, which neuerthelesse are called not offerings, but offering: the same worde applyed to the sacrifices of Christians can not inforce them to be one. Howbeit, were they one, to graunt you that by a supposall: yet might

that one sacrifice be a spirituall sacrifice, and so your Masse no whit the neerer. For as the Prophet 
                     Esai. 66.20. 
                  Esay saith that the Gentiles shalbe an offering to the Lord, vsing 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   the same worde that the Prophet Malachie: so the Apostle 
                     R

                  sacrifice, holy, acceptable vnto God, speaking of their sundry sacrifices as one; as also, in a mysterie, 1. Cor. 10.17. Rom. 12 5. Ephes. 4.4. 
                  we that are many are one body. But without supposall, the course of the text doth import rather that the Prophet, saying, there is offered an offering, doth meane not one, but many, by 
                     Synecdoche speciei.
                   that figure which you touched: as by 
                     Enallage temporis.
                   an other figure he saith, it is offered, meaning, it shall be offered. For 
                     Mal. 1. ver. 8. & 9. the Lord declaring his detestation of the sacrifices of the Iewish Priests, saith that 
                     ver. 10. 
                  he will not accept an offering at their hand: but 
                     ver. 11. 
                  the Gentiles shall offer to him a cleane offering, which he meaneth of the contrarie that he will accept. And this he sheweth farther, where, touching it againe, he saith 
                     Mal. 3. ver. 3. 
                  it shall be offered vnto him in righteousnesse, 
                  
                     ver. 4. 
                  and shalbe acceptable to him. Now, the offering that is 
                     Philip. 4.18. Heb. 13.16. 1. Pet. 2.5. 
                  acceptable to God from the Gentiles in the new testament, is all sortes of spirituall sacrifices and good workes. By the offering therefore mentioned in Malachie there are many sacrifices meant, not one onely. Which yet your olde translation maketh more euident, opening the meaning of the Hebrew word by terming it sacrifices, 
                  
                     Mal. 3.3. 
                  They shall offer 
                  
                     Sacrificia.
                   
                  sacrifices to the Lord in righteousenesse. Wherefore sith our offering that should please God in the time of the gospell, is sacrifices by the iudgement of your old translation, which 
                     Concil. Trident. session. 4. you in no case may refuse; and sacrifices can not be meant of the Masse, for that is one sacrifice, but of spirituall sacrifices it may, for they are many, as Allens second reason saith: you see, we must conclude on his owne principles, that the cleane offering, which Malachie writeth of, doth signifie the spirituall sacrifices of Christians, and not the sacrifice of the Masse. The third and fourth reasons haue greater shew, but lesser weight. For, though it be true that spirituall sacrifices of praying to God and doing good to men are common to the Iewes with vs, and therefore may seeme not to be the offering spoken of in Malachie, which, beside that it is proper to the Gospell and the Gentiles, it should succeed also the sacrifices of the Iewes, and be offered in their steede:

yet if we marke the difference that the scriptures put betweene the Iewish worship of God in the law, and the Christian in the gospel, that séeming wil melt as snow before the sunne. For in the law of Moses, the Iewes, 
                     Heb. 8.5. &

                  the sanctuarie, that is to say, the temple built therein. Now Christ, in the gospell, when that was fulfilled which the temple of Ierusalem and sacrifices did represent, shewed that 
                     Heb. 9.10. 
                  the time of reformation was come, and remoued that worship both in respect of the place and of the maner of it. For as it was prophecied that 
                     Dan. 9. ver. 26 
                  he should destroy the citie and the sanctuary, 
                  
                     ver. 27 
                  and cause the sacrifice and offering to cease: so him selfe taught that 
                     Ioh. 4. ver. 21 
                  now the Father would not be worshipped in Ierusalem, nor 
                     ver. 22. as the Iewes did worship him, but 
                     ver. 23. & 24. 
                  he would be worshipped in spirit and truth. The Christian worship therefore that did succéede the Iewish, doth differ from it in two pointes: one, that it worshippeth God not in Ierusalem, but in all places; an other, that it worshippeth him in spirit, and truth; in spirit, without 
                     Heb. 7.16 & 9.10. 
                  the carnall ceremonies & rites; in truth, without 
                     Col. 2.17. Heb. 10.1. 
                  the shadowes of the law of Moses. The which sort of worship séeing 
                     Ioh. 4.13. 
                  hee requireth of the true worshippers, that is of all the Saintes, his seruants; and in the new testament 
                     Rom. 1.7. 1. Cor, 1.2. Ephes. 1.1. &

                     ▪ 11. & so foorth. the Gentiles by the Gospell are called to be Saintes: the worship, that is proper to the Gospell and the Gentiles, is the true spirituall worship of God, the 
                     Rom. 12.1. 
                  reasonable seruing of him by 1. Cor. 5.8. godlines, and 
                     Ephes. 2.10. & 4.25. 
                  good workes, in righteousnes, and true holines; euen 1. Pet. 2.5. 
                  the offering vp of spirituall sacrifices acceptable to God by Iesus Christ. And thus you may sée the weakenes of those cauils which are brought to proue that our spirituall sacrifices cannot be the offering whereof God in Malachie saith it shall be offered to him in euery place. For the former of them, that spirituall sacrifices of prayers and workes are common to the Iewes with vs, deceiueth with a fallacie: because ou
                     •
                   
                  spirituall are spirituall méerely, whereas they had carnall sacrifices with their spirituall. The later doth

discouer this fraude of the former, but with an other fraude. For in that it saith, that praying, fasting, and the workes of charity were ioyned to their sacrifices: it sheweth that their worship (though in part spiritual) was not spiritual méerely. But in that it gathereth thereof, that these things cannot succeede their sacrifices, there is an other fallacie: because although the worship of God were still spirituall, as 
                     Ioh. 4.2
                        •
                     . hée is still a spirit, and so no worship may succéede, for how can a thing succéede it selfe? yet, the same in substance came foorth in sundry maners, and so one maner of it might succéede an other. As 
                     Heb. 1.1. the word of God, touching the saluation of men by faith in Christ, was alwayes the same: but vttered in sundry maners by the Prophets, and by Christ. In which sort the worship of God was ordered also: by the Prophets, 
                  
                     Exod. 34.33. Heb. 8.5. couertly, vnder the vailes of ceremonies; by Christ, 
                     Mat. 27.51. 
                        •
                     . Cor. 11.3. plainly and simply. Wherefore, as the doctrine of Christ did succéede the doctrine of the Prophets, both the same doctrine, but taught by Christ more cléerely, more darkely by the Prophets: so the spirituall worship of God in the Gospell succéeded his spirituall worship in the law, both the same worship, but laden with ceremonies & shadows in the law, disburdned of them in the Gospell.
            
            
               Hart.
               I can not sée those fallacies which you charge D. Allen with. For if the Iewes did offer prayers to God and other such spirituall sacrifices, as they did: then is it true, as he saith, that spirituall sacrifices are common vnto them with vs. And if they be common vnto them with vs, it foloweth, in my iudgement, that ours succeede not theirs: sith to succeede, is to come after; and how may that come after which did go before?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I haue shewed, how. And if you sée it not: 2. Cor. 3.14. 
                  the vaile may be the cause, which is very likely to be laide on your heart in reading of the new testament, as it was on the heart of others, in reading of the olde. For the thing is plaine of it selfe, and euident, that the spirituall sacrifices which the Iewes offered, as namely their prayers, did not discharge their duetie but they must offer carnall also; and that not euery where, but in the place that God had chosen. In so much, that albeit they might pray in all places lawfully, as wée may, yet must they come thither to worship God 
                     Exod. 23.17. at certaine times: and Daniel, though hée could not because of their captiuitie, yet

                     ver. 7. to present themselues before God in Sion. Whereas Christians, of the other side, 
                     Col. 2.14. neither haue those altars or offerings made theron to ioyne with their spirituall 
                     Heb. 13.15. 
                  sacrifice of prayse, and they may

                  sing the songs of the Lord 
                  1. Tim. 2.8. 
                  in al places. No land is strange: no ground vnholy. Euery coast is Iewry, and euery towne Ierusalem, and euery house Sion, and 2. Cor. 6.16. euery faithfull company, yea 1. Cor. 6.19. euery faithfull body a temple to serue God in. The Christian worship then doth differ euen in prayers from that of the Iewes, both in respect of the temple, 
                  1. King. 8. ver. 30. & 33. & 42. & 44. & 48. which they had a regard to: and of the ceremonies of the law, which they were bound therwith to keepe. Wherfore, as 2. Cor. 3.6. 
                  the ministery of the new testament, that is, of them who taught the gospell, came after the ministerie of Priestes in the old, and yet both old and new are the Lords testament: so might and did the worship of God amongst Christians in spirit and truth come after the worship of God amongst the Iewes, though yet they both did worship God spiritually. For the Iewes before did worship in the temple with the ceremonies of the law: as when 
                     Luk. 1. ver.

                  the multitude of the people were praying in the outter. And the Christians after did pray without incense in any place, the people and Pastour all together: as

But these points of difference betweene vs and them be perhaps the harder for you to vnderstand, because your Popish worship is so lyke the Iewish, both for the temple, and the ceremonies, that you may iustly thinke their worship was in spirit and truth as much as yours. For as the Priest with them was seuered from the people by the diuision of

the sanctuarie and court of the temple:

               There is a vaile rather of presumption ouer your heart, who cōdemne the Catholike ceremonies as Iewish: then of ignorance ouer ours, who embrace them as Christian. For 
                     Sess. 7. de sacrament. in genere. can. 13. the Councell of Trent, which was gathered togither and guided by the holy Ghost, hath accursed them who say that the receiued and approued rites of the Catholike Church, vsed in the solemne ministring of sacraments, may be despised. And those of the blessed sacrifice of the Masse, whereat your spite is greatest, 
                     Session. 22. cap. 5. the holy Fathers of that Councell haue shewed to be grounded on the tradition of the Apostles, not on the law of Moses. For as much (say they) as the nature of men is such, that it cannot be lifted vp easily to the meditation of diuine things without outward helpes: therefore our holy mother the Church hath ordeined certaine rites, to weete, that some things should be pronounced in the Masse with a soft voice, and some things with a lowder. Moreouer she hath vsed ceremonies too, as namely mystical blessings, lightes, incense, vestiments, and many other such things, 
                  
                     Ex Apostolica disciplina & traditione.

These are the Councels words. Whereby you may perceiue, that the rites and ceremonies vsed at the Masse, are not Iewish, but Apostolike: as (if neede were) it might be shewed in particulars, of incense, by S.

                     Extra. De sacra vnctione. cap. vnico.
                   Pope Innocentius saith that the Catholike Church doth holde that Bishops ought to be anointed, because the Lord commanded Moses to anoint Aaron and his sonnes: and againe, that temples, and altars, and chalices ought to be anointed, because the Lord commanded Moses to anoint the tabernacle, and arke▪ and table with the vessels.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               But Pope Innocentius addeth, that the sacrament of vnction (or anointing) doth figure and worke an other thing in the new testament then it did in the old. And thereof he concludeth that they lye who charge the Church with Iudaizing (that is, with doing as the Iewes did) in that it celebrateth the sacrament of vnction.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Yet Pope Innocentius doth not bring that difference betwene the Iewes and you, that your holy vnction is made of oyle, and balme, where theirs was made of oyle & myrrhe with other spices. He knew that the difference of this or that ingredient in the stuffe of it would not cléere your Church from Iudaizing in the kinde of the purgation, that is, the rite whereby you sanctifie Priests and altars. No more, then if you should sacrifice a dogge, and say that you doo not therein as the Iewes did, because they did sacrifice, not dogges, but shéepe & oxen. As for the difference by which the Pope seuereth your vnctiō from theirs, that yours doth worke and figure an other thing then theirs did: first, it wrought as much in their altars, as in yours, for any thing that I know. Secondly, it figured in their Priests the giftes of the holy ghost: which he saith it doth in yours. Thirdly, were it so that it had an other either worke or meaning with you then with them, as after a sort it hath, both in respect of God by his word. Exod. 39.22. him, who ordered theirs; and To figure & betokē Christ. Heb. 8.5. out of Exod. 25.40. the cause, why: yet might the ceremonie be Iewish notwithstanding. For (I trust) you will not maintaine but it were Iudaisme for your Church to sacrifice

but that Christ is come, and 
                     Reu. 14.1. hath by his passion both entred in himselfe and brought in others to his glorie. At the least, S. Peter 
                  
                     Gal. 2.14. 
                  did constraine the Gentiles to Iudaize, (as you terme it,) when they were induced by his example and autoritie to allow the Iewish rite in 
                     Leuit. 11.47. & 23.25. choise of meates. Yet neither he, nor they allowed it in that meaning, which it was giuen to the Iewes in. For it was giuen them 
                     Col. 2.16. to betoken that holines, and 
                     Gal. 4.3. traine them vp vnto it, which Christ by his grace should bring to the faithfull. And Peter knew 
                     Act. 2.38. that Christ had doon this in truth, and 
                     Act. 10.15. taken away that figure, yea, 
                     Act. 15.10. the whole yoke of the law of Moses: which point he taught the Gentiles also. Wherefore, although your Church doo kéepe the Iewish rites, with an other meaning then God ordeined them for the Iewes, as Pope Innocentius saith, to salue that blister: yet this of Peter sheweth that the thing is Iewish, and you doo Iudaize who kéepe them.
            
            
               Hart.
               
                  S. Peter did not erre in faith, but in behauiour, when he withdrew him selfe from eating with the Gentiles. For that was a defaute in conuersation not in doctrine, as 
                     De praescriptionib. aduers. haeret.
                   
                  Tertullian saith. Neither doth S.

               I graunt. For he offended not in the truth of the gospel, but 
                     Gal. 2. ver. 14. in walking according to it, that hauing liued before not as the Iewes, but Gentile-like, yet 
                     ver. 12. then hee left the Gentiles for feare of the Iewes, and 
                     ver. 13. 
                  dissembled his iudgement touching that point of Christian doctrine. But this doth so much more conuince both your Church of Iudaizing in her ceremonies, and your doctrine of corrupting the gospell with that leauen. For if S. Peter

               Alas. And sée you not how giddily the Councell doth bring in that reason, that because our nature doth neede outward helpes, therefore some things should be pronounced softly, some aloude? For the very chiefest of the outwarde helpes, which God hath ordeined to raise our mindes from earth to heauen, is 
                     Matt. 13.23. Act. 13.15. 1. Cor. 14.19. 
                  the hearing of his word. His word is rehersed in the Epistle, the Gospell, the Canon, and other partes of the Masse. The Masse

Yet not content with that, you will a part of it to bee saide with a soft voice, that the poore soules may not as much as heare it. Wherefore the reason which your Councell maketh for that Massing-rite, is this in effect, that because the blindenesse and coldnesse of men doth neede to be lightened and warmed by Gods worde▪ which is rehearsed in the Masse: therefore a part of it must be pronounced with a soft voyce, that they

may not heare it; part with a lowder, but in a strange toong, that, although they heare it, they may not vnderstand it. And was there not a mightie spirit of giddines in the Princes of Trent, that made them write so droonkenly? Yea,

               They curse him who saith that the rite of the Roman Church, whereby part of the Canon and the words of consecration are vttered with a soft voice, is to be condemned: or that the Masse ought to be celebrated onely in the vulgar toung. And great reason why.

                  the Iewes, when they could not iustifie their wilful withstanding of the Sonne of God, agréeed, that if any man confessed him to be Christ, he should be excommunicated: so by like reason your Iudaizers of Rome doo banne and curse vs, when they cannot iustifie their impudent customes and corruptions against vs.

               The customes are Catholike and religious rites, which they do establish with the seueritie of the curse.

Now the knowlege of it is like to breede contempt. Beside there is danger, least, by hearing of it often times expounded, men become to wise, and smell out your abuses. The lesse they doo know: the fitter to be Papists. For 
                     Rom. 10.3. 
                  ignorance is the mother of Popish deuotion: as 2. Pet. 1.5. 
                  knowlege is the nurse of Christian religion.

                  ignorance is the mother of all errors: neither do we séeke to noosell Christians in it, but to weane them from it, as those decrées of the Councell do sufficiently shew.

               They shew sufficiently that you professe so: but how well you séeke it, the former decrées of the rites, by which the people is nooseled in ignorance, do more sufficiently shew. Nether is it likely that all Pastours and Curates shall haue skil

and leasure to expound the scripture to the people often. It may be that the seruice, read, and heard in a knowen tongue, would teach them more in a day, then some of them will in a moonth. Or if euerie Church had as good a Pastour, as Paule wisheth Timothee to be, that would 2. Tim. 2.15. 
                  diuide the word of truth a right: yet they, being vsed 
                     Act. 13. ver. 15. to heare the scripture read, should vnderstand him better, as 
                     ver. 17. 
                  the Iewes did Paule, and be (through Gods grace)

                     Concil. Triden. Sess. 22. c. 4. they say that because the nature of men doth neede outward helpes for raysing of it vp to think vpon the things of God, therefore hath the Church ordeined those rites, that some things in the Masse should be pronounced with a soft voice, and some things with a lowder: the one, not to be heard; the other, not to be vnderstood. And yet herein their dealing is the more plaine, that they doo acknowlege the Church to haue ordained these rites. For if they would haue hardned their faces, and said, that they receiued them from the Apostles by tradition: they might as well haue said it, and proued it as soundly, as they doo of others, lightes, incense, vestiments, and all the rest of their beggerie.

               Nay, the name of beggerie is to good for it. For if S. Paule called the ceremonies of the Iewes

               You doo vs great iniurie to apply S. Paules words, spoken of the Iewish ceremonies which should cease, to ours which should continue. Much more, in that you say that God

ordeined not ours, as he did theirs. For he ordeined theirs by Moses, and ours by S. Paul.

Austin speaketh of nothing but that which the whole Church obserued, as namely the receyuing of the Sacrament fasting: which custome being kept alike of all Christians, he gathereth on S. Pauls wordes to the Corinthians (10 Cor. 11.34 
                  other thinges will I set in order when I come) that he ordeined it.
            
            
               Hart.
               It is true, S. Austin doth speake of those rites, which the whole Church obserued through the world without any change or diuersitie of maners. But so much the more doth he proue the doctrine of the Councell of Trent. For the rites, which 
                     Sess. 22. cap. 5. they say, the Church hath receiued from the Apostles by tradition, are namely mysticall

                  blessinges, lightes, incense, vestiments, and many other such thinges. And for these S. Austins witnesse is of force that S. Paul ordeinedal that order of dooing which we call the Masse. For the proofe whereof you may sée a cléerer testimonie of his in 
                     Epist. 59.

                  how those wordes differ one from an other in S. 
                  1. Tim. 2.

                     . 
                  Paul, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giuing of thankes, doth tell him that he thinketh thereby is vnderstood that, which all the church, or in a maner all practiseth, to weete, that supplications are those which are made in celebrating of the sacramēts before that which is vpon the Lordes table beginne to bee blessed; prayers, when it is blessed, and sanctified, and prepared to be distributed, and diuided; intercessions, when the people is blessed and offered to God by their Pastours as it were by aduocates; which thinges being doon, and the sacrament receyued, the giuing of thankes doth knit vp all, which S. Paul in those wordes remmbreth also last. Now, what is there here more for your Masse, then for our Communion? Or if our Communion, which differeth from your Masse no lesse then light from darkenesse, yet hath all these thinges which S. Austin toucheth as meant by S. Paul: what face hath Torrensis, who saith that S. Paul is auouched by S. Austin to haue ordeined all that order of dooing which you call the Masse? Is this your Iesuites dealing with the auncient Fathers to make them fetch your Massing rites from the Apostles?

               That is amongst his sermons, but none of his sermons. For it vseth the wordes of Gregorie, a Bishop of Rome who liued long after: and mo thinges it hath by which it is certaine (as 
                     Censur. serm. 59. in append. de diuersis. Tom. 10. your Diuines of Louan note) that it is not S. Austins. Howbeit neither he that did compile that sermon, whosoeuer it were, saith that the ceremonie of the crosse in consecrating was of S. Paules ordinance, or a tradition of the Apostles: which is the point that you had to proue by S. Austin; and, if you proue it not, you doo not cléere the Trent-councell. For I graunt that

                   before it, the Christians, as they vsed to signe their forhead with the crosse, in token that they were not ashamed of Christ crucified, whom the Iewes and Gentiles reproched for the death which he suffered on the crosse: so they brought the rite thereof into the sacraments, and vsed both the figure of the cross

                  To signe their forhead with a crosse, but not to signe the sacraments. Tertullian was so ancient, that he wrote (it séemeth) before that custom grew. Besides, you mistake him if you thinke he meant by the name of [tradition] a tradition of the Apostles. For what soeuer custome not writen in the scripture was kept by the faithfull, that, because it was deliuered by some body from whom the vse thereof was taken, hee saith it came in by tradition. In so much that he affirmeth it both of

                   to be naught. But hereby them selues haue opened their iudgement, that not all which Hildebrand is said to haue learned vnder ten of his predecessours was the tradition of the Apostles. And it is worth the noting how these mysticall blessings, which at Trent were fathered on the Apostolike tradition, haue lately got that parentage by the helpe of such as was Hildebrands scholer, whē before they séeme not to haue béene accounted so. For 
                     De ecclesiast. offic. l. 3. c. 24. 
                  Amalarius, (whom I named,) a man that was likely for zeale to speake the best, for skill to know the most that might be said of the seruice and ceremonies of the Church; he had read so much and trauailed so farre euen to Rome, and that in embassage from the Emperour to conferre with the Pope about them: yet this Amalarius, speaking of the signe of the crosse which they vsed to make in consecratiō, leaueth it in dout whether Christ made any when he did blesse the bread, or rather thinketh he made none, because the crosse at that time was not yet set vp; but now (saith he) wee know that it must be made, for S. Austin saith so. Where it is not probable that he would haue grounded it on mans autoritie, if he could haue said that either Christ had vsed it, or, though Christ vsed it not, yet the Apostles had ordeined it. No more, then that after the testimonie of S. Austin he would haue iudged it sufficient to crosse the bread and wine once, if he had thought that so many crosses, as you make, were to be required by S. Austins iudgement.
            
            
               Hart.
               Thus you reproue vs as varying from S. Austin, because we make so many. What may we say of you who make none at all? Who nether vse it in consecration of the holy sacraments, nor signe your forheads with it, nor set it in your Churches,

nor allow it in the sanctifying of meates and other creatures. Though all these things were doon by the ancient Fathers, in remembrance of him who dyed for vs on the crosse: yea, though Christ himselfe haue commended to vs the signe thereof by miracles, as the storie of Constantine the Emperour doth witnesse;

But nether the vision of Christ vnto Constantine, nor that and other miracles which haue béene wrought by it, nor the practise of the primitiue Church and ancient Fathers can preuaile with your men, but that they must séeke to raze out from among Christians so worthy and notable a monument of Christes passion. And yet you will beare the simple people in hand that you are of the same religion that they were, when you plucke down that which they did set vp, and do cleane contrarie vnto them.

For you thinke it a speciall defense against the diuell; and (by your common phrase) they do blesse them selues who signe their brestes with it; and you carry about you crosses made of mettall, with an opinion that you are the safer thereby, as

For, the honour of an image is referred to that which the image resembleth: and the motion of our minde is the same to the image of a thing, as an image, and to the thing it selfe. Wherefore, sith the crosse doth represent Christ, who died vpon a crosse, and Christ is to bee worshipped with diuine honour: it foloweth that the crosse is to bee worshipped so too. Yet you and your men are still obiecting to vs our honouring of the crosse, as though we committed idolatry therein. In good sooth, Maisters, ye are too young to controll the Church of Rome in her dooings.

And in deede you haue almost as much reason to speake for the maintenance of this spirituall whooredome, which you commit with the crosse: as he for the carnal, which they commit with Courtisans. Now wel had it fared with the brasen serpent, if Thomas had béene schoolemaister to king Ezekias. For he would haue taught him, that sith the brasen serpent did represent Christ, and Christ was to be worshipped with diuine honour: therefore the brasen serpent was to bee worshipped so too. You are angrie when wee say that you worship the Pope, 2. Thes. 2.4. 
                  as God. Me thinkes you should graunt it. Sure you might defend it by this Schoolediuinitie. For, though he beare one way

                  an image of God, whom he resembleth more liuely then any crosse or crucifix doth represent Christ. But to returne to the mysticall blessings of the Masse, which you went about to fetch by S. Austin
                  
from the Apostolike tradition: you sée that neither they, nor incense, nor lightes, nor vestiments, nor the rest of that suite of ceremonies are mentioned at all, much lesse auouched to be Apostolike, in that of S. Austin which your Iesuite groundeth on.
            
            
               Hart.
               I know that S. Austin doth intreate rather of the substance of the Masse, then of the ceremonies, in that place. But

                   in the other which I cited he doth intreate of customes: and so, that he proueth the ceremonies of the Masse to haue come from the Apostles. For of the thinges (saith he) which we keepe by tradition, it is to bee thought that such as are obserued through the whole world were either ordeined by the Apostles them selues, or by generall Councels. Wherefore sith the ceremonies of incense, lightes, vestiments, and other of the like sorte were not ordeined by generall Councels: it followeth by S. Austin, that the Apostles did ordeine them.

               That rule of S. Austin, is probable, not necessarie. For though it be likely that there was no custome obserued by the Church through the whole world, which it had not from the Apostles, chiefly, seeing

For how can you proue that incense, lightes, vestiments, and the rest of your baggage were vsed at that time through the whole world?

sixth day the Lord did perfit heauen and earth: but also the nine which Bishops haue beyond them, in token that they are spirituall like the nine orders of Angels, as Pope

               But they both togither do make fifteene vestiments: which Bishops must put on, when they say Masse, As Innocentius and Durand say▪ in the places quoted. to signifie the fifteene degrees of vertues (according to the fifteene psalmes of degrees) wherewith they must be clad. And, I may tell you, it will be as hard to proue that any Bishop did weare those fifteene vestiments in the primitiue Church: as, that euery Bishop, who weareth them in yours, hath the the fifteene degrees of vertues which they signifie.

                  a Priest that did beare the plate, meant (by an allusion to the lawe of Moses) that he entred as it were into the sanctuarie with prerogatiue, and had the very mysteries of God

                  Ierom séemeth somewhat to incline: who translating the same of Polycrates touching Iohn, saith, that hee was a high Priest bearing the plate of gold vpon his head. For if he had vsed to beare a plate of gold in déede, vpon his forhead: sure, when

you would haue it, and S. Iohn had worne a miter like to Aaron: yet his example proueth not that all Apostles, much lesse that all Bishops wore it. Nay, the speciall note thereof in S. Iohn doth rather proue the contrarie: as, when we reade that 
                     Mat. 3.4. 
                  Iohn Baptist had his garment of camels heare, and a girdle of skin, we gather that all preachers wore not such apparell.

               I graunt that the attire, which Tertullian speaketh of, doth touch your miter néerer: but it doth not proue it. For 
                     Cic. in Verr. lib. 4. Virg. Aeneid. lib. 2

                  Apollo did weare in their solemnities. Of the which ceremonie Tertullian deriuing a prouerbiall phrase (after the maner of his style) doth say touching Christians, who refuse to be counted Priests, that 
                     Deponimus insulas.
                   
                  they lay downe the miters. In déede it is likely the miters of your Bishops came from that heathnish rite: although they draw some what from the Iewish custome, as

                  Wolfgangus Lazius, your friend, hath well obserued. But it is neither true, nor fit for you to hold, that it was a miter worne by Christian Priests which Tertullian meant. Not fit for you to hold: least all Priests be proued to haue as good right to the miter, as your Bishops; which doctrine they will neuer account of, as catholike. Not true: because your Bishoply miters were not vsed in many hundred yeres after Tertullian.

Wherefore the first and highest of your Massing-vestiments is nether confirmed by the plate in Eusebius, nor by the miters in Tertullian. The next is the stole: whereof you haue no better proofe in S.

At least, séeing Satyrus was nether Priest, nor perfit Christian: what shew haue you of likelihood that it was a Massing-vestiment?

                  Isidore, who liued néerer to them, then did S. Ambrose to the Councell. And as for that Councell, and the other of Braga: no marueile if the stole be mentioned in them. For they were kept at Aboue sixe hundred years after Christ. that time when rites did steale in upon religion verie fast. Though nether was it then halfe setled in the Masse yet: as by a later 
                     Concil. Bracarens. 3. cap. 3. 
                  Councell of Braga may be gathered. Howbeit, if it had béene: your proofe faileth still. For you may not say that because a Spanish Councel speaketh of it, therfore the Church had it by tradition of the Apostles. Unlesse you will say also, that your shauen crownes ought to be great circles about the whole head by the tradition of the Apostles, and not such little circles on the toppe of the head onely, as now a daies are made: because

                  Councell of Carthage, maketh nothing. For though the name of albe be deriued from alba, by which word the Councell doth note a white

garment, as it were a surplisse, forbidding the Deacōs to weare it all the seruice time: yet the thing differeth from your Massing-albe which is peculiar to Priests, as 
                     Dist. 93. cap. Diaconus in cónuentu. in glossa. Durand. in Ration diuin. offic. lib. 3. cap. 1. the Canonists also declare on the same worde of the Councell of Carthage. Which difference remoueth your proofe, out of

                  the holy robe that reached downe to the feete, and with the heauenly crowne of glorie, and with the vnction of God, and with the Priestly garment of the holy Ghost. Wherein, as the garment, and vnction, and crowne do signifie spirituall giftes, not thinges corporall: so the holy robe that reached downe to the feete betokeneth that function, which

               And what gaine you by it, if so much were granted? For you cannot proue by any circumstance of the place, that it must be a Massing-robe. The onely shew of any such is in your last proofe out of the Gréeke Fathers, Chrysostome, and Basil; or rather, out of the Liturgies, which falsely beare their names; or rather, out of some copies ofthose Liturgies, wherin are mentioned the amice, the girdle, the chisible, and the fanel. Howbeit, if a man should sift the Gréeke words, out of the which you picke these, and conferre your amice with their

And so hee goeth forward shewing in particular, how Stephen, and Siluester, and other Popes, and Prelats did softly bring them in, and some deuised this, some that, either to resemble the

roabes of the Iewish Priests, or to note a mysterie. To be short, it is shewed plainely by them all, that the Massing-vestiments of Bishops at that time (which was eight hundred yeares after Christ) were but eight in number: iust as many as Aarons. Whereof the former seuen, (for the eighth was proper to Archbishops onely) are growen now to be fiftéene, more then twise as many. And doo you not perceiue hereby, M. Hart, how lewdly D. Stapleton alleageth the Fathers, to proue your Massing-vestimentes all to haue bene vsed by the primitiue Church? How falsely the Councell of Trent doth father them, nor onely them but also lightes, incense, crossinges, and other ceremonies of the Masse on the tradition of the Apostles? And sawe I not truely that if you see not how the Christian worship of God in spirit and truth doth differ from the Iewish, and so might succeed it: the cause thereof (by likelihood) is the vaile of Popery, which hauing brought in a Iewish kinde of worship doth hide it from your eyes?

And so, to leaue this matter to their consideration: your owne confession, yeldeth enough for my purpose touching the place of Malachie. For if the spiritual worshipping of God, wherewith the Iewes did serue him, had ceremonies in number more, in signification darker, then it hath amongst the Gentiles: this kinde of seruing him with fewer ceremonies & cléerer is proper to the Gentils, & might succeede that which was amongst the Iewes. Wherefore D. Allens third, & fourth reasons, whereby he would proue that the offering spokē of in Malachie the Prophet must signify the outward sacrifice of the Masse, and not spirituall sacrifices, can take no holde against vs. No more then ours could take against you of the contrarie, if we should conclude that it must betoken a spirituall worship not outward offeringes on an altar, because outward offeringes are common to the Iewes with vs, and this is proper to the Gentiles: and this should succéede the Iewish worship of God, and come in steede of it, which no outward offeringes and sacrifices can doo, sith they are coopled alwayes to Gods spirituall worship. Would you allow these reasons?
            
            
               Hart.
               They are not like to D. Allens. But the fifth reason doth put the matter out of doubt. For, (in the iudgement chiefly of heretikes,) 
                     Nostra opera sunt inquinata, vtcunque speciosa vide antur.
                   our workes are defiled, howsoeuer they seeme bewtifull: but that 
                     Prophetica oblatio per se munda est.
                   Propheticall offering is cleane of it selfe, and so cleane of it selfe in comparison of the olde sacrifices, that it cannot be polluted any way by vs or by the worst Priests. For here in our testament, they can not choose all the best to them selues, and offer to the Lord for sacrifice the féeble, the lame, and the sicke, as before in the old: because there is now one sacrifice so appointed, that it can not be changed; so cleane, that no worke of ours can distaine it.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               And thinke you M. Hart, that the workes of Christians can not be the offering which the Prophet speaketh

of, because they are defiled, howsoeuer they seeme bewtifull? Thinke you thus in déede? Then you consent yet in the chiefest point of Christian religion (which God graunt you doo) with heretikes, as you terme vs. For, if our workes be defiled, howsoeuer they seeme bewtifull, chiefly as heretikes iudge: then are men iustified by faith, not by workes. If our workes bee defiled, howsoeuer they seeme bewtifull: then fulfill we not the law of God perfitly, much lesse super-erogate. If our works be defiled, howsoeuer they seeme bewtifull: then are they meritorious of euerlasting death, but euerlasting life it is impossible they should merit.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, I meant not so. For though they be defiled, as they are of our selues: yet as they are of Christ, whose grace worketh in vs, they are pure and perfit.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then, as they are wrought by the grace of Christ, so they may be the offering which the Prophet speaketh of. For they are pure and perfit so, and therefore cleane by your owne opinion.
            
            
               Hart.
               But the Propheticall offering is cleane of it selfe. Our workes are not cleane of them selues, but of Christ: and therefore can not be that offering.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Now may you féele the falshood of D. Allens dealing. For himselfe addeth those words [
                     Per se.
                   
                  of it selfe,] to make his reason serue: the Prophet saith no more but that 
                     Mal. 1.11. the offering is cleane. Wherefore sith our workes are cleane and vndefiled; chiefly as Papistes iudge: our workes might be meant by the Propheticall offering, howsoeuer they be vnperfit and impure of them selues.
            
            
               Hart.
               What? And doo you thinke, M. Rainoldes, that our workes, though vncleane of them selues, yet as they are wrought by the grace of Christ, are cleane and vndefiled? And see you not then, that of the other side you consent in the chiefest point of Catholike faith with Papists, as you terme vs? For if you thinke in deede that our workes bee cleane, as they are wrought by grace: then must you néedes thinke that we may so fulfil the law, and merit life, and be iustified by workes, not by faith onely.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               I meant not so, M. Hart. But according to the prouerbe, that for a hard knot a hard wedge must be sought,
                  
I thought good to cleaue a Popish dreame in sunder with a Popish fansy. For otherwise, I know, that, although our workes be wrought by Christes grace: yet is mans nature and flesh in vs who worke them, and therefore doo they cary a staine of vncleannes. It was of grace, that the children of Israel did consecrate their holy thinges and giftes to God. Yet that worke of theirs was not frée from spot: in so much that

                  that hee might put them into the prayers of all the Saintes vpon the golden altar which is before the throne, and the smoke of the odours put into the prayers went vp before God out of the Angels hand. Which is a token that the prayers of Saintes haue their infirmitie: and yeelde no sweete smelling fauour vnto God, without fauour in Christ. To be short, in all the gratious and good workes of men,

               Hart.
               But if all our workes be muddy, as you say, and stained with vncleannesse: then is it much surer that the cleane offering, which the Prophet speaketh off, cannot betoken them. For the Lord reproueth the Iewish Priests there for 
                     Mal. 1.7. 
                  offering vncleane bread, and sacrificing the blinde, the lame, and the sicke. Wherefore sith of the contrarie he saith that the offering made among the Gentiles shall be a cleane offering: it foloweth that he meant not the spirituall sacrifices, that is, the workes of Christians; and what then, but the outward sacrifice of the Masse?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               In déede if cleane things stained with vncleannesse were the verie same that vncleane things: you might iustly thinke that our spirituall sacrifices could not be allowed, no more then the carnall of those Iewish Priests. But the onely sacrifice that is cleane perfitly, and hath no staine at all, is 1. Pet. 1.19. & 2.22. 
                  Christ, the vndefiled and vnspotted Lambe, 
                  
                     Heb. 9.25. & 
                     
                        •
                     3.12. 
                  offered on the crosse to sanctifie vs with his blood. The sacrifices of the faithfull are cleane, but vnperfitly: and therefore néede his fauour, with pardon, (as I shewed,) that they may be 1. Pet. 2.5. 
                  acceptable to God through Iesus Christ. The sacrifices of the wicked, and hypocrites, are vncleane: as being either vnlawfull, such as were 
                     Leu. 22.22. 
                  the blinde, and lame, and sicke among the Iewes; or offered vnlawfully, with 
                     Tit. 1.15. 
                  mindes and consciences defiled. So the sacrifices of those Iewish Priests, which God

reproueth, were absolutely vncleane. Our spirituall sacrifices are vnperfitly cleane: cleane in comparison, and cleane by acceptation. Cleane in comparison & respect of men: as Habacuk complaining that 
                     Hab. 1.13. 
                  the wicked man deuouteth the righteous, saith, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  him that is righteous in respect of him selfe; praysing not the righteous man as simply righteous, but in comparison of the wicked. Cleane by acceptation in the sight of God: who dealing as a louing father with his children, taketh in good part that which they doo willingly, though they doo it weakely. For as 
                     Leu. 22.20. he accepted the sacrifices of the Iewes, when they offered the best and soundest that they had: so when 
                     Esai. 66.20. 
                  the Gentiles were brought him for an offering, in like sort as the Israelites doo offer an offering in a cleane vessell, 
                  
                     Rom. 15.16. 
                  the offering vp of them was acceptable to him. And thus might the spirituall sacrifices of Christians be meant by the cleane offering, whereof the Lord saith in the Prophet Malachie that it shall be offered to him in euerie place. According to the scripture, that instructeth vs 1. Tim. 2.8. 
                  to pray in euerie place, lifting vp pure hands without wrath, and douting. For though nether our prayers be so intier and feruent, nor our hands so pure, and vnspotted of the world, nor our mindes so setled in loue of our neighbour, nor our faith so constant, and stedfast towards God, but that they be stained with remnants of vncleannes, and haue lesse perfitnes then they should: yet are they all cleane in respect of 
                     Mal. 1. ver. 8. & 13. the sacrifices of those Iewish hypocrites, which God in the Prophet reiecteth as 
                     ver. 7. & 12. 
                  vncleane; and so, where he 
                     ver. 10. & 13. refuseth to accept theirs, he 
                     Mal. 3.4. promiseth to accept ours, and sheweth that 
                     Rom. 12.1. Phil. 4.18. Heb. 1

In déede there is no letter through all the scriptures for it. And thus much perhaps him selfe hath espied, since hee wrote his treatise of the sacrifice of the Masse. For in his Apologie of the English Seminaries, (where he would of likelihood make the strongest proofe of it, that he could, for the defense of Masse-priests, and the Masse-priests Nourseries,) The Apologie of the English Seminaries chapt. 6. he citeth not the scriptures, but the Fathers onely. Which, vnlesse hée thought that the scriptures faile him, I sée not why hee should. Chiefly, sith he knoweth, that they, whose good liking of Masse-priests, & the Masse he séeketh specially to winne by his Apologie, doo giue greater credit to fiue words of God then to ten thousand words of men.

               Nay, you are deceued much in D. Allen, if you think his iudgement changed any whit from that it was in this point.

and offer, as 1. Cor. 10.16. & 11.24. they did, be to say Masse: then wee say Masse in our Communion, and our Ministers are Masse-priests Which (I thinke) you meane not.
            
            
               Hart.
               I meane that all the Fathers said Masse, as we doo; and were, as we be, Masse-priests. Which he meaneth also, and proueth by the most of them. For so was S. Ambrose, 
                  
                     Lib 5. epist. 33 testifying of him selfe that he offred sacrifice, and said Masse, euen in that plaine terme.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  In that plaine terme? Why? S. Ambose spake not English, I trust.
            
            
               Hart.
               No. But he saith in Latin, Missam facere.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               That is not to say Masse, but to doo masse, or rather to dimisse. 
                  
                     Paulinam coniunxit sibi breuique missam fecit.

                  Suetonius, would proue the Masse as wel as that. Which I dare not say that perhaps him selfe espied since he wrote it, least againe you tell me that I am much deceiued in him. But in

                   his Apologie turned into Latin, S. Ambroses missam facere is changed into missam dixisse. And so the words are fitter to proue he said Masse.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               
                  Dixisse, or facere: the matter standeth not in that, but in the word missa. From which sith the name of Masse dooth come in English: it foloweth that S. Ambrose did celebrate Masse, that is, say Masse, as wée terme it.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Must I tell you again, that idiot commeth from idiota? And wil you say that all the simple, idiotae, who heare Masse, are idiotes?
            
            
               Hart.
               That is a iest: you may not so put off my reason. For the name openeth the nature of the thing, as 
                     De interpret.
                   
                  Aristotle sheweth. Wherefore sith the name of Masse is in S. Ambrose: how can you deny but that hee did celebrate the thing, that is, the Masse it selfe, as we doo, whom you call Masse-priests?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               And thinke you in earnest that S. Paul did celebrate the communion of the body and blood of Christ, as we doo, who are called Ministers?
            
            
               Hart.
               As you doo? who saith so?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               You: if your reason be of any value. For the name openeth the nature of the thing, as Aristotle sheweth. Wherfore sith the name of communion is in S. 
                     Cor. 10.16▪
                   
                  Paul: how can you deny but that he did celebrate the thing, euen the communion it selfe, as we doo, who are called Ministers?
            
            
               
               Hart.
               Yes. For though you keepe the name with S. Paul: yet you keepe not the thing. As 
                     Act. 8.9. & 13.6. 
                  sorcerers are called magi, like 
                     Mat. 2.1. 
                  the Sages of the East: yet is their wisdome wicked, not like that of the Sages.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               That is false M. Hart, as you referre it to our Communion. For as we keepe the name, so we kéepe the meaning of the name too: and therefore the thing it selfe with S. Paul. But turne it to your Masse: and it is very true. For in S. Ambroses time the Christian people, hauing publike prayers in many Churches dayly,

                   to dimisse the rest who might not communicate, the faithful onely staying to receue together. And this dimission of them was noted by the word

                  missa, 
                  As the word, remissa, is vsed for remissio. Tertullian. contr. Marcion. lib. 4. Cyprian. de bono patient. Augustin. de baptism. contr. Donatist. lib. 3. cap. 18. vsed for missio, that is a sending away, or licensing to depart. Whence it came to passe that the very name of missa was geuen to that part of the seruice: and they were said missam facere, who celebrated the communion as S. Ambrose did. Wherefore though your sacrifice keepeth the name of Masse, that S. Ambrose vsed: yet doth it not keepe the thing meant thereby. For nether send you them away, who receiue not: and many a Masse is said that hath no communicants.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               But we wish (as 
                     Sess. 22. cap. 6. the Councell of Trent hath declared) that

                  the faithful, who stand by at Masse, would communicate. Wherefore if they doe not: it is through their owne default, and not through ours.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But it is your faute that you send not them away from the communion who communicate not. And herein your Councell doth vary from S. Ambrose, and other ancient Fathers, that it alloweth non-communicants to be standers by. For in the primitiue Church, yea, in S. Gregories time, (who for

               Hart.
               They pray, and communicate both in affection,

though they receyue not alwayes the communion bodily, nor vnderstand the prayers.

               You grate on the Communion still, as if the Canon and all S. Gregories Masse did aime at that. Which is not so. For the principall point thereof is the sacrifice, euen the soueraine sacrifice, that is, our Sauiour Christ offered to God his father. And sith this is that which the Canon speaketh of, and S. Gregorie offered, and the Masse importeth with vs, whom you call Masse-priests: it foloweth that S. Gregorie celebrated the sacrifice of the Masse, as we doo; and therefore was a Masse-priest, not a Minister of the Communion.

               It was bread and wine before consecration: as it is declared by those wordes of the Canon. But after consecration the Canon saith of it, Hostiam puram, hostiam sanctam, hostiam immaculatam, that is, the pure, holy, and vndefiled host.

Wherefore the bread, and the cuppe, that is, the wine, though holy now, and sanctified to be the bread of life, and cup of saluation, that is, the body and blood of Christ in a mystery, but the bread, and wine are the pure, holy and vndefiled sacrifice, or host (as you terme it,) not onely before but after consecration too.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, the reall body, and blood of Christ are meant by the bread, and the cuppe, in a figuratiue spéech: and so Christ himselfe, is the pure, holy, and vndefiled host.

So that, if Christ him selfe were meant really by the bread, and the cuppe, in a figuratiue spéech: then the Priest desireth God to looke on Christ with a mercifull and cheerefull countenance, and to accept of him at the Priests request, as he did accept

                     Homo iam Deo propitius esse debebit.
                   
                  man must be merciful vnto God now; vnlesse it please the Priest, Christ shall not finde fauour in his fathers sight.
            
            
               Hart.
               The prayer of the Priest that God will looke vpon his offrings, and accept them, hath a very good meaning, whereof I doo not dout. But the former wordes, touching the hoste, must néedes betoken Christ. For how can the name of a pure, holy, and vndefiled hoste be geuen to the bread, and wine?

                  pure, or vndefiled giftes, offeringes, and sacrifices in the Canon it selfe before consecration?
            
            
               Hart.
               They may be called pure by acceptation there, as your selfe expounded. Which the Canon seemeth to imports also, in that it prayeth God 
                     Vti accepta habeas, & bene
                           •

               Euen so they may be called here a pure, holy, and vndefiled sacrifice. For the Canon also likewise prayeth God to accept them, in expresse termes; and, in effect,

                  to blesse them. Whereof it hath a farther and plainer proofe too, in that it saith they offer to God that pure sacrifice, the bread of life, and cup of saluation, 
                  
                     De tuis donis ac datis.
                   
                  of his giftes. For in saying that they offer it of the giftes of God, it sheweth that the very bread and wine is meant. Which the people being vsed then to offer, (as now we offer mony:) the rest there of was geuen after

to the poore; a part was taken first for the vse of the communicants, that they might be partakers of the bread of life and cuppe of saluation, that is, the holy sacrament of the body and blood of Christ.
            
            
               Hart.
               I know that the name of sacrifice is giuen to the peoples offerings, and other things often. But I am perswaded that, by the pure, holy, and vndefiled sacrifice, S. Gregorie meant Christ: and so did offer him vp to God his Father, in the Masse, as we doo. Which I thinke the rather, because they were Masse-priests (as our Apologie sheweth,) who liued in the function of Priesthood before him. For the holy 
                     Cap. 14. Councell of Nice knew none but such offerers, or sacrificing, that is, Massing-priests. S. 
                  
                     Epist. 5. 
                  Cyprian acknowledgeth the Priests of his time, to haue offered, or sacrificed, yea euen in prisons. Hee was a Masse-priest, that S. 
                  
                     De ciuit. Dei l. 22. c. 8. 
                  Austin sent to doo sacrifice in a house infested with euil spirits. They were Masse-priests of whom 
                     In vit. Constantin. l. 4 c. 45. 
                  Eusebius writeth, that they pacified the diuine maiestie with vnbloody sacrifices and mysticall consecrations. The dignitie of Priesthood set forth in the worke of the same title by S. 
                  
                     Chrysost. de sacerdotio.
                   
                  Chrysostome, is specially commended there for the power of dooing the vnbloody sacrifice vpon the altar. To be short, he, and all the other Fathers both Gréeke and Latin were Masse-priests, none being euer made but for that purpose principally: S.

But the Fathers named their offering, a sacrifice, not properly, but by a figure: meaning the death of Christ (our onely very, soueraigne, true, and proper sacrifice,) to be represented there, in a mysterie, not exequuted in deede. For as in the Scripture sacraments are noted by the names of thinges whereof they are sacraments, that men may lift their eyes from the outward signes to the things signified: so because we are willed 1.

                  to shew his death; that shewing of his death, and remembring of his sacrifice, is called by the Fathers his sacrifice, and death. So doth

                  we mention his death in all sacrifices, he geueth this as a reason of it, 
                     Passio est enim Domini sacrificium quod offerimus.
                   
                  for the death of Christ is the sacrifice which we offer. So doth Chrysostome open his meaning of the sacrifice. For he affirmeth it to be

                  we offer the very sacrifice that Christ did, he correcteth his spéech thus,

                     Magis autem recordationem sacrificij operamur.
                   euen with Chrysostomes words. So 
                     Epist. 23. ad Bonifacium.
                   
                  Austin saith that Christ, although he were sacrificed but once in himselfe, 
                  
                     Omni die populis immolatur in sacramento.
                   
                  is sacrificed euery day to Christian folke in a sacrament or mysterie: nether is he falsly said to be sacrificed. For sacraments haue 
                  
                     Quandam similitudinem.
                   
                  a certaine resemblance of those things whereof they are sacraments; and for that resemblance they take the names commonly of the things themselues: as the sacrament of the body of Christ is Christs body 
                  
                     Secundum quendam modum.
                   
                  after a certaine sort, and the sacrament of the blood of Christ is Christs blood. Finally, Eusebius (who may serue also to declare the iudgement of the Councell of Nice, whereof he was a part) doth by the very name of vnblooddy sacrifices witnesse his agréement therein with the rest. For he calleth our remembrances and representations of the death of Christ in celebrating the sacrament of his body and blood, though sacrifices, for the lykenes; yet vnbloody,
                  
for the difference: to shew that Christ is not sacrificed in them truly, and properly, (for then must his blood be shed, as it was, when he suffered death,) but onely by the way of a sacrament, & mystery, wherein the true sacrifice is set foorth before vs, and remembred by vs. And this he maketh plainer

               Nay, Eusebius calleth our sacrifices, vnbloody, in respect of the maner, and not of the thing. For they are true sacrifices of Christ, and therefore bloody: but Christ who was offered vpon the crosse blooddily, is offered in the Masse vnblooddily.

And this is the most that you can make of the Fathers, although it be graunted that they called their celebrating of the Lordes supper an vnbloody sacrifice in respect of the blooddy sacrifice of Christ which hee offered on the crosse. Much lesse make they for you, if they called it not so in respect of his sacrifice, but of the sacrifices of the Iewes. Which it is the more likely that they did, because they called their

                  the Ministers (for so Eusebius termeth them) did offer vnto God, may well be vnderstoode by those sacrifices too. But if hee meant onely their offerings of the remembrance of Christes death in the sacrament, as that which ensueth of mysticall consecrations may séeme to import: yet himselfe declareth by the word [vnblooddy] that he called them sacrifices, not properly, but by a figure; as meaning not that Christ is put to death there in deede, but in a mysterie. To be short, he, and all the other Fathers, both Gréeke, and Latin, are so fully and plainly of one mind in this point: that the

                  whether that which the Priest doth exequute be called a sacrifice properly, resolueth that it is not. But that which is offered and consecrated by the Priest is called a sacrifice (saith he) and an offering,

               Hart.
               Yes: We haue no other English for sacerdos.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Where S. Austin addeth then touching Ierom, that nether he must be contemned because he was presbyter: what here shal presbyter be? Wil you make S. Austins spéech so vnsauory, as to tell the heretike, that he ought to reuerence Irenaeus, Cyprian, Ambrose, and the rest, because they were Priests; and not contemne Ierom because he was a Priest?
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, I would translate here, presbyter, a Priest: but, for sacerdotes, I would say Bishops. For that is S. Austins meaning in these places where he doth name them sacerdotes.

               So 
                     Greg. Martin. in his Discouer. chap. 6. your translatour doth. But the word Bishop is our English of episcopus. And what if episcopus chaunce to come in too, with sacerdos, and presbyter? How will you expresse them? As where in

                   Lawier noteth on it, Vide vt sacerdotes vocet episcopos veteri more, quem ignorantes

plerique presbyteros sacerdotes appellari promiscuè stuliè opinantur. Wherein, if you translate sacerdotes, Bishops, and presbyteros, Priests: then your Lawier saith (which were a wise speech) that Isidore calleth Bishops Bishops, after the old maner, which many not knowing do folishly think that Priests are called Bishops indifferently.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Such sentences cannot be well expressed in English▪ but the Latin words must be kept in them.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But it is behoofefull for our English men to haue them in English, that they may know your Latin abuses of Rome. For this is meant thereby, that the ancient writers are wont to note Bishops by the name of Priests: which many not knowing doo foolishly think that the name of Priests is vsed indifferently for the same that Elders. A lesson for your Rhemists, who make them all one, although not of foolishnes so much as of fraude: to the intent that

                   they were accustomed to geue the name of Priests, not generally to Elders, but to Bishops onely. Wherefore to auoide confusion of things, which the confusion of words might ingender, in that we are to treate off: I will (by your leaue) call presbyter an Elder, as our translations doo; that I may distinguish it from the name of Priest, both as it is vsed by you for a Masse-priest, and as it is vsed by the Fathers for a Bishop. So to come at length back againe to that which I was in hand with, of the second sort of the Bishops of Rome,
                     The fifth Diuision.
                   that, when they were growen to their fattest plight, they were but Archbishops of a Princely diocese, not vniuersall Popes and Patriarkes of the whole world: the Elders (as I said) ordeined by the Apostles in euery Church, through euery citie, chose one amongst themselues whom they called Bishop, to be the President of their companie, for the better handling and ordering of things in their assemblies and meetings, wherein they prouided by common counsell and consent for the guiding of the flock of Christ committed to them. Which point of care and wisdome the Bishops folowing also, knowing that

In which, as the Iudges and Iustices with vs doo heare at certaine times the causes of the whole shire: so the ruler of the prouince with them did minister iustice, and made his abode there ordinarily. Whereupon by reason that men for their busines made great concourse thither: the church was woont to furnish it (of godly policie) with the worthyest Bishop, endued with gifts aboue his brethren. And they reposed in him such affiance, that they did not onely commit the

                     Wolfgang. Laz. comment. reip. Rom. lib. 2. cap. 2. the state ecclesiasticall folowing the ciuil,) did grow in power too. Nether were they onely named Archbishops and Patriarkes of the diocese, that is, the chiefest Bishops and Fathers of that circuite which the Lieutenant ruled: but also they obteyned that the Metropolitans of the prouinces in their diocese should be likewise subiect and obedient to them, as Bishops were to Metropolitans. So the Archbishop and Patriarke of Antioche had

So 
                     Concil. Chalced. Act. 16. it was granted to the Archbishop and Patriarke of Constantinople, that the Metropolitanes of the dioceses of Pontus, Asia, and Thracia, (As appe

                     Concil. Chalced. can. 9. & 17. decréed that if a Bishop had any matter of controuersie with the Metropolitan of his own prouince,

                  the Patriarke of the diocese should be iudge thereof: as also if any man did receiue iniurie of his own Bishop, or Metropolitan. Thus were the Roman Popes (as they are called now) first Bishops ouer Elders within their own citie; next, Metropolitans ouer Bishops within their own prouince; then Archbishops, and Patriarkes ouer Metropolitans within their own diocese. And this is the Princely diocese, which I meant, when I said that the Pope in the time of Pelagius was become Archbishop of a Princely diocese; but he was yet but an Archbishop: hee was not vniuersall Pope and Patriarke of the whole world. For although the Patriarke of Constantinople, being puffed vp because in his citie not the Emperours Lieutenants were resiant, as in the rest, but the Emperour himselfe, aspired to be therefore Soueraine of the rest, and as the Emperour counted himselfe

               It is more requisite that the Popes in our time should reserue Bishoprikes to their owne bestowing, that they may prouide good Pastors for the Church, then it was of olde. And therefore lesse maruell if they choose them selues such as they know fit, and will haue the confirming of such as other choose: though their predecessours (when the dayes were better) did neither choose any, nor confirme all.

                   one of the third sort of Popes saith, that greater causes of the Church, chiefly such as touch the articles of faith, are to be referred to the See of Peter. And this was the meaning of Innocentius the first. For, in 
                     Epist. 91. inter epist. Augustin.
                   his letters to the Councell of Carthage writen to like effect on the same occasion, he saith, that the Fathers decreed by the sentence not of man, but of God, that whatsoeuer was doon in prouinces far of, they thought that it ought not to be concluded before it came to the notice of the See of Rome.

               It is true that questions of matters touching faith are causes of the Church: but they are not such causes as quicken the Papacie. The causes touching persons, which Zosimus, Boniface, and Caelestine did deale for, when they would haue it lawfull for Bishops & Elders to appeale to Rome, are those which Popes must liue by. And the same Councels of Carthage
                  
and Mileuis, whom Innocentius wrote too, did know, and shew this difference, when they desired the Popes consent in that of faith, but

                     D. Saunders, de visib. Monar. eccles. lib. 7. your Irish champion doth thinke the Popes supremacie to be cléerely proued, is a demonstration in truth to disproue it. For, rehersing only those which you haue named, with England, Ireland, Corcyra, and Graecia, and saying yt 
                  Gregorie did practise the supremacie ouer their Bishops, and Churches, though neither prouing so much, but admit he proued it: yet, in bringing only the names and proofes of these, he sheweth that Gregorie did not practise it ouer the Bishops and Churches of Thracia, Mysia, Scythia, Galatia, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Armenia, Pamphylia, Lydia, Pisidia, Lycaonia, Phrygia, Lycia, Caria, Hellespontus, Aegypt, Iury, Phoenicia, Syria, Cilicia, Cyprus, Arabia, Mesopotania, Isauria, with the rest of the countries subiect to the Patriarkes of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioche, and Ierusalem.

               Though S. Gregorie speake not of these particularly: yet he sheweth in generall his supremacie ouer them. For whereas the Patriarke (saith 
                     Registr. lib. 7. ind. 2. epist. 64. he) doth confesse himselfe to be subiect to the See Apostolike: if any fault bee founde in Bishops, I know not what Bishop is not subiect to it.

               True: he addeth that beyond the canons of Councels, and the lawes of Emperours. But in the meane season, he yéeldeth that the causes of Bishops, who were subiecte to any other Patriarke, must not be referred to the Popes See. Whereby it is euident that not all their causes through the whole world were claimed by S. Gregorie. And herewithal by this place it may be noted too, that when he nameth the See and Church of Rome the head of all Churches, he meaneth it of excellencie for sundrie giftes aboue them, not of the supremacie for power to gouerne them. Which answereth the question that you made before

The Lord Mayor of London might chaūce to haue a fauourer, who would aske thereon: If the citie of London be the head of all cities, why not the Mayor of London the head of all Mayors?

                  cases which Popes reserue now from ordinarie Iudges to their owne Eschequer: the seconde sort of Popes was so farre from doing it, that they were in their graues many hundred yeares before the sent thereof was felt. Wherefore you ouerreach

                  the Bishop of Rome hath alwayes vsed the practise of the supremacie. For it is apparant by this which I haue shewed, that not one of them for the space of sixe hundred yeares after Christ did euer either vse it, or claime it as his right.
            
            
               Hart.
               Yes: they hearde the causes of Clergie-men appealing to them, and held that they might doe so. Wherefore they claimed the supremacie, and vsed it too.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Which reason is as good, as if a Kentish Gentleman should say that all the Countie of Kent is his own, because he hath a Lordship in the Weald of Kent.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               What? doe you accounte it so small a matter, that Clergie-men, yea Bishops shoulde appeale to them out of all prouinces through the whole world?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               A goodly Lordship and large. But nothing so large as the Weald of Kent, much lesse as all Kent. There are many Lordships mo within the Countie, which the auncient Popes neither had, nor claimed. One Lordship of being subiecte to no man, no not to the Emperour. An other, of hauing power ouer Princes to excommunicate and depose them. An other, of binding Bishops, Metropolitanes, and Patriarkes with an oth to be their faythful subiects. An other, of giuing Church-liuings and offices vnto whom they list. An other, of breaking the bandes of al Councels with dispensations and decrées. An other, of reseruing cases to their Sée. Whereof (to passe the rest, which you may finde recorded in their

               Hart.
               But will you graunt that so much then of the suprepremacie

as they claimed or vsed, belongeth to their Sée, and is theirs of right.

                   which I made against them was of two branches: one, that they auouch not the supremacie of the Pope; the other, that they auouch more, through affection, then is true and right. And this is very manifest not onely by the dealinges of them whom I named: but also by the writinges of them whom you alleaged.
            
            
               Hart.
               Of the thirde sort of Popes if you meane: they may be refused perhaps with greater shewe of reason. But they, whom I alleaged, of the second sort, were holy men, and Saints.
            
            
               Rainoldes,
               The Apostles of Christ (I hope) were Saintes too. Yet hath the spirite of God set down for our instruction that 
                     Mat. 20.20. Luke. 9.46. & 22.24. they did not onely desire superioritie, but also striue about it. Innocentius, Leo, Gelasius, Vigilius, Pelagius, and Gregorie, the men whō you alleaged, were not greater then the Apostles. And the praise which they giue to their See of Rome, doth so excéede the truth: that it beareth euident markes of their affection. You might haue perceiued it in that which you cited out of

Howbeit the thirde sort (I graunt) are best worthy to be excepted against for this fault. For it is a small thing with them to vse spéeches repugnant to the Scripture: but they must abuse, yea, coine scripture too, for maintenance of their Papall port. They can teach the Church that

               That which is cyted out of the booke of kinges, is in the booke of Deuteronomie. The text is true scripture, though the place mistaken. And, though it belong not to the Pope immediatly.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Nay, neuer goe about to salue it, M. Hart. That of Deuteronomie we haue 
                     Chap. 6. Diuis. 1. alredy handled. Pope Leo ye tenth and his Councel of Laterane had a strong affection to make the Popes Kinges, when they alleaged the booke of kinges for Deuteronomie, & Deuteronomie for the Papacie. But what soeuer you think of the third, or seconde, or any sort of Popes: it is against all law both of God, and man, that they should bée witnesses in their own matter. And therefore if your proofe of their supremacie be no better: the iury will cast you, out of all controuersie. For

               The power, which they claimed, hath séemed ouer large to enuious and malicious men. But it was no more then their right and due. Which because you thinke not sufficiently prooued by the Popes themselues: I will prooue it farther by the wordes and testimonies of other ancient Fathers.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Of whom?
            
            
               Hart.
               Of the chéefest of them, both Gréeke and Latine. For it was the prerogatiue of the Popes office that made S. Bernarde séeke to Innocentius the third, Epist. 190. S. Austin and the Bishops of Afrike to Innocentius the first, and to Caelestinus, Epist. 90.92.95. S. Chrysostome to the saide Innocentius, Epist. 1. & 2. S. Basil, to the Pope in his time, Epist. 52. S. Ierom, to Damasus, Epist. 57.58. tom. 2. and other likewise to others: that by them they might be confirmed in faith and ecclesiasticall regiment.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               If you bring such witnesses to proue the Popes supremacie: I must request the iury to haue an eye to the issue. For some of these Fathers desired to be helped by their aduise, and counsell; some by their autoritie, and credit; some by both. By their aduise, and counsell▪ as Ierom, of Damasus. By their autoritie & credit: as Chrysostome, of Innocentius. By both: as Basill, Austin, and the Bishops of Afrike, of the Popes in their time. Bernard somewhat more. But he liued yesterday, in comparison of the rest: and therfore not to be numbred amongst the auncient Fathers. Though neither he by this point proueth the Papacy. And what his iudgement was thereof 
                     Chap. 6. Diuision, 4. I haue declared. Now for them, first, who asked the aduise and counsell of the Pope: I will tell you a storie, which (I pray) consider of. 
                     Socrat. hist. ecclesiast. l. 5. cap. 10. 
                  Theodosius the Emperour desirous to procure the peace of ye Church, consulted with Nectarius the Patriarke of Constantinople,
                  
what way might best be taken for ending controuersies of religion. The Patriarke imparted the matter to Agelius a Nouatian Bishop. The Bishop to Sisinius, a reader in his church. The reader gaue aduise and counsel to the Patriarke. Which the Patriarke liked of, and shewed it to the Emperour: the Emperour embraced it, and dealt according thereunto.
            
            
               Hart.
               You would inferre hereof that the auncient Fathers might aske the Popes counsell, and yet not acknowledge him to be their supreme head.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               True: as the Emperour might of the Patriarke; the Patriarke, of the Bishop; the Bishop of the reader.
            
            
               Hart.
               The case is not like. For it was the personal wisdome, vertue, lerning, or faith of these men, which made them to be sought to. But that, which made the Fathers séeke to the Popes, was the prerogatiue of their office:
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Wherein they could not erre, as you heard say at The Rhemish Annot. on Luk. 22.31. 
                  Rhemes. But you who distinguish the office of the Popes from their personall faith and giftes in this sorte, must be put in mind that by the same reason 
                     Sext Synod. Constantinopolit. act. 12. 
                  Sergius the Patriarke of Constantinople sought to Pope Honorius, in respect not of his personall wisedome, vertue, learning or faith, but of his office too. And so shall your selfe be forced to confesse, that eyther the Pope may erre in consultations, which he dealeth with by reason of his office, as Pope Honorius did: or, the Fathers séeking to the Popes for counsell, did séeke in respect of their personall giftes, that they were learned and godly Pastours; as 
                     August. epist. 
                           •
                        om. 2. many sought to Austin then, 
                     Caluini epistolae & resposa.
                   to Caluin lately, though neither of them were Pope.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay: it is certaine that S. Ierom sought to Damasus for his office sake. For 
                     Epist. 57. he speaketh namely of the chaire of Peter: that is, the Sée Apostolike committed to Damasus.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But withall he speaketh of the inheritance of the Fathers, that is, the Christian faith, which Damasus kept vncorrupted. And therfore he sought to him as a godly lerned, not as a Pastour only: not for his office sake alone, but for his person, succéeding as in place, so in doctrine to Peter. Though in whatsoeuer respect and consideration Ierom sought to Damasus: his séeking to be resolued in a point of faith, doth not

Wherefore the auncient Fathers, who sought aduise of Popes, proue not the Popes supremacie. No more doe they in déede who sought to further others, or reléeue themselues, by the Popes autoritie. For autoritie & power differ: that such, as are their brethrens superiours in the one, may be their inferiours or equals in the other. As

               It may be so, I graunt. But they, whom I named, sought to Innocentius the first and other Popes, as to supreme heads of all the Church in power, not as to their superiours in autoritie only.

                  Chrysostome 14. being called into iudgement by his enemies, namely, by the Bishop of Alexandria & others assembled in a Councell, did appeale from them to a generall Councell, and (as 
                     Epist. 1. ad Innocentium,
                   himselfe speaketh thereof) to iust iudgement. Whereby hee declareth that the lawfull power of iudging his cause belonged to the Councell, and not to the Pope.
            
            
               Hart.
               But when he was depriued and cast out of his Bishoprike, notwithstanding his appealing to the generall Councell, he requested the Pope to write that those things being wrongfully done were of no force, as in deed they were not, and that they who did him such wrong, might bee punished.

               But in this request hée dealt with the Pope as with a member only of the generall Councell, to which hée had appealed: a member, in power; a principall member, in autoritie. For in praying him aboue the rest to write: he shewed that he thought him to be of greater credit then other of his brethren. But, in appealing to them all ioyntly, not to him alone: hée shewed that the right of iudging the matter belonged, not to him, but to them in common.

                     Princ. doctr. lib. 7. cap. 10. 
                  Stapleton sheweth,) that they thought no Councell to be of any force vnles he confirmed it. For

               The Councell of Nice had no such fansie of the Pope. Their epistle is forged: and he, who forged it, was not his craftes-master. For one of the

                   Fathers pretended to haue writen it is Macarius Bishop of Constantinople. Whereas 
                     Cassiodor. in chronico. Sigon. de occident. imper. lib. 4.

                  conferred with the Bishops of the whole citie of Italie. And so it is more sober, but no more séemely for the Councell of Nice. Finally, neither Eusebius, (who was at the Councell) nor Rufinus, nor Socrates, nor Theodoret, nor Sozomen, nor other auncient writers doo mention any such thing. Only

               It is, and so witnessed, that it ouerthroweth the Popes soueraintie, which D. Stapleton would proue by it. For they wrote ioyntly to Damasus, Ambrose, Britto, Valerian, Ascholius, Anemie, Basill, and the rest of the Westerne Bishops assembled in a Councel at Rome. Nor only to them, but to the Emperour Theodosius. Yea, to Theodosius in seueral, and more forcibly. For

               Nay: your own distinction of power and authoritie, dooth serue well and fitly to this of the Emperour. For their decrées and ordinances of doctrine, were true; and of discipline, good; though he had not confirmed them. But more would accept of them as good and true, through his word & countenance. As we see that many doo frame themselues to Princes iudgements. Wherefore it was the Emperours autoritie and credit, for which they desired his confirmation of their decrées: not for any soueraintie of power that he had in matters of religion.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  Not for any soueraintie of power that hee had to make matters true, of false; or good, of euill: but to make his subiectes vse them as good, and true, being so in déede. Which perhaps the Fathers of the Councell meant too. But your own answere may teach you to mend your imagination of that they wrote to Pope Damasus. For the doctrine of Christ, which they decréed, was true; & the discipline, good; though he had not consented to it. But more would accept of it as good, & true, through his agréement and allowance. As we sée that manie doe follow the mindes of Bishops. Wherefore it was the Popes autoritie and credit, for which they desired his consent to their decrées: not for any soueraintie of power that he had in matters of religion. Which is plaine by their crauing not of him alone, but of other Bishops to like thereof also, that the Christian faith being agreed vpon, and loue confirmed amongst them, they

might keepe the Church from schismes and dissensions.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               All Bishops might allow the decrées of Councels by consenting to them. But the Pope confirmed them in speciall sort. For S. 
                  
                     Epist. 29 tom. 4. oper. Cyrill.
                   
                  Cyrill saith of the third general Councel of Ephesus, that Pope Caelestinus wrote agreeably to the Councell, and confirmed all thinges that were done therein.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  S. Cyrill sayth not that of Caelestinus, but of Sixtus. Howbeit, if he had: yet this would proue autoritie still, and not power. As 
                     In chronico.
                   
                  Prosper noteth well that the Nestorian heresie was specially withstood by the industrie of Cyril, and the authoritie of Caelestinus. But these very wordes of Cyrill, touching Sixtus, doe ouerthrow your fansie conceaued on the Popes confirming of Councels. For, the Councell of Ephesus was of force and strength in Caelestinus time by your own confession. Notwithstanding Sixtus, who succéeded him, did confirm it afterward. In déede ye truth dependeth neither of Coūcel, nor of Pope: though, whē Popes & Councels were good & godly minded, they were chosen vessels and instruments of God to set forth the truth. For as Ioshua sayd to

And why? Because the iudgement of so many Fathers of a generall Councel seemeth to be iustly and worthily preferred before the iudgement of one man in a matter of faith. Wherevpon he addeth that the Councell then is aboue the Pope,

Thus it is apparant by your owne Doctors, that, to confirme Councels importeth an autoritie the Pope had, not power: and that hée was not soueraine in autoritie neither, no not as much as equall, but inferiour to them. So farre is it off from prouing his supremacie.
            
            
               Hart.
               Though Councels be aboue the Pope in autoritie, after the opinion of Cardinall Turrecremata: yet you sée he setteth the Pope aboue them in power of iurisdiction, wherin his supremacie doth principally stand. And that did the Fathers acknowledge by their déedes too. For Athanasius Bishop of Alexandria, Paul of Constantinople, Asclepas of Gaza, Marcellus of Ancyra, Lucian of Adrianople, and very many other Bishops of the East, being driuen out of their Churches by the Arians,

did appeale to the Pope, as

                     lib. 7. c. 10. the former with S. Cyrill. Hath he abused you so often, and will you neuer cease to credit him?
            
            
               Hart.
               The stories shew that they came to Rome to Pope Iulius, and he for the prerogatiue and dignitie of his Sée restored them to their Churches, perceiuing that the Arians had depriued them wrongfully.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The dignitie and prerogatiue of the See of Rome, in restoring them, was but of autoritie, and honour, not of power. For the power of hearing and iudging their cause did rest in the Councell assembled then at Rome. Which Iulius himself, and Athanasius both do testifie. Athanasius, who speaking thereof 
                     Apologia. 2. ascribeth it plainly to the Councell. Iulius, who being reproued by the Arians for ouerthwarting that which they had done in their Councell, 
                     In epist. ad episcopos Antiochiae congregatos. Apud Athan. apol. 2. answereth that the doinges of a former Councell may lawfully be sifted and examined in an other; that themselues had offred to haue the cause debated so in iust iudgement, and thereto had requested a Councell to be called; that Athanasius and the rest appeered at the Councell, and they who should haue also appeered made defaute; that hereupon the Councell finding their iniquitie, relieued the parties wrongfully oppressed; to be short, that whatsoeuer he dealt or wrote therein, he did it on the Coū
                     cels iudgement, and consent, not on his owne head. Wherefore it was not the Pope, but the Councell, that heard and determined the causes of Bishops, whether at first, or on appeales. Such power of iurisdiction nether did Iulius claime, nor Athanasius giue him.

But it is no liker it, then black is to white. The canons, which it coineth with the image and superscription of the Nicen Fathers, bewray the lewdnesse of it. The more, because

                  Iulius in the same epistle (as Athanasius hath it) citeth their autoritie for the Councell aboue the Pope, who in this are cited for the Pope aboue the Councell. Wherefore sith Athanasius hath his right epistle, as it is confessed: you must be content to let the other go for a counterfeit.

               Whatsoeuer you conceue ofthe doings and writings of Athanasius and Iulius: yet can you not denie but Flauianus Bishop of Constantinople appealed to Pope Leo from the Councell of Ephesus deposing him vniustly. And so did Theodoret Bishop of Cyrus too▪ For

                  Flauianus appealed from the Councel of Ephesus: but to a greater and a more lawfull Councell, not to Pope Leo. Which appéereth by an epistle of 
                     Epist. 13. 
                  Leo himselfe, complayning to the Emperour Theodosius of the fewnesse and oppression of the Bishops in the Councell of Ephesus; and desiring that a generall Councell might be kept, because Flauianus

                  and to all the Bishops of these partes. So Leo, and the Bishops being ioyned together, will make the Councell of Chalcedon: by the which Councell 
                     Concil. Chalc. act. 1. the cause of Flauianus and his appeale was iudged. The same Councell also 
                     act. 8. did iudge Theodorets cause; & finding him guiltlesse restored him to his Sée. Wherefore sith the Councell was iudge of the appeale: if he appealed to Leo, and not to the Councell, it was an ouersight. Unlesse perhaps he did not appeale as to a higher iudge▪ that might restore him; but as to a man of learning and autoritie, whose credit and iudgement might helpe to proue him not guiltie. And this doth the tenour of

                  hall the aduise of Leo, whether he shall beare that wrongfull depriuation, or seeke to be restored: he séemeth to haue thought of a further matter. Which yet he toucheth so, in speaking of troubling men, and crauing Leos prayers: that it is euident it lay not in Leo alone to restore him. Wherefore, the most that you may well imagine of an appeale made by Theodoret to Leo for remedie of the wrong done him, is, that Leo tooke his bill of appeale to preferre it to the Councell whereof he was President. As with vs in England the billes are put vp to the Speaker of the Parlament, that he may informe the Parlament thereof, not as though himselfe had soueraine power to passe them.

               Then you grant that Leo was President of the Councell, as in déede he was, and head of the Bishops therein, as

You must pardon me, if I discredit rather the word of one Gregorie: then thinke that sixe hundred and thirtie such Bishops did offer to commit so great iniquitie and folie. For neither is there any proofe of that offer in any part of the Councell, which is wholy extant: and that which made

                  Gregorie to misreport the Bishop of Constantinople, might induce him likewise to misreport these Bishops too. Wherein his affection may be the more suspected, because 
                     lib. 7. ind. 1. epist. 30. he sayth farther, that it was offered to his predecessors not only by the Councel, but also by the Fathers following. The names (it is likely) of these Fathers following should haue bene foorth comming, if they had bene at hand, the matter being so important. Howbeit if they, and the Councell both, had not only offered it, but giuen it also: yet might they haue giuen it in respect of lesser preeminence then the Papacie. Which it must needes be the Councell should haue done: for else they had contraried

               That is, in the Catholike Church of the citie of Rome. For Cornelius himselfe, in whose epistle that is written, sayth other where (entreating

                     Euseb. hist. eccles. lib. 6. c. 42. in a Synode which then was held at Rome, there were aboue threescore Elders and Deacons: how many hū

And, that this was meant in that of Cornelius, it is very plaine by the occasion of his speéche: as also by the canon of the Councell of Nice made on that occasion.

Wherefore the Bishoprick of the Catholike Church, in the time of Cornelius, was the charge that euerie Catholike Bishop had. Neyther meant they more who sayd that there ought to bee but one Bishop in a Catholike Church, then S.

                  Cyprian writeth, that neither heresies nor schismes haue sproong of any other fountaine, then of this, that the Priest of God is not obeyed: and that one Priest for the time in the Church, and one iudge for the tyme in steede of Christ is not regarded. To whom, if the whole brotherhoode would be obedient according to Gods teachings: then no man would make any thing adoe agaynst the company of Priests. Wherein, by one Priest, he meaneth one Bishop; and, by one Bishop, Cornelius the Pope, to whom he writeth those wordes.

               You erre still in the same point. The Church wherein Cyprian requireth obedience vnto one Bishop and iudge in Christs steed, is the particular Church of euery citie, not the vniuersall. For he speaketh it on occasion of iniurie offered to himselfe by the Nouatians in Carthage: who there had ordeined a new Bishop against him, as their fellowes did in Rome, against Cornelius. And as the words

                   after, do shew that he meaneth it of all Catholike Bishops, ech in his owne charge: so the whole discourse & circumstances argue that he applieth it to himselfe, not to Cornelius. Chiefly, that, of

                   I haue declared. Marry, that which followeth is of greater shew, out of Ambroses commentarie on S. Paul to Timothee: where Damasus (the Bishop of Rome in his time) is called ruler of the Church. But, first, whatsoeuer he were who wrote that, it was not S. Ambrose the famous Bishop of Milan: on whom are falsly fathered the cōmentaries on S. Paul, as your

Next, the wordes themselues which are in that autour on mention of the house of God, [the ruler whereof at this day is Damasus,] are not (in my iudgement) the autours owne wordes, but a glose crept in amongst them. For whereas S. Paule, writing vnto Timothee, declared why he did so, to wéete, that thou mayst know how thou oughtest to behaue thy selfe in the house of God, which is the Church of the liuing God: 
                     Commentaria quae Ambrosij titulum ferunt. in 1.

               Rainoldes.
               But S. Austin addeth in as plain termes, that Bishops may reserue their cases to the iudgement of their fellow-bishops, chiefly of the Apostolike Church: and that a generall Councell is aboue the Pope in iudging of those causes too. Which is a cléere proofe that by the principalitie of the Apostolike See he meant the Church of Rome to be chéefe of other Churches (as I sayd) in honour, not in power. For in power, al others, at least the Apostolike, (that is, in which the faith of Christ had bene taught by the Apostles themselues) are made equall with it. But amongst all, in which the Apostles themselues had taught the faith, the Roman for honour & credit had the chiefty. And thus haue I discharged my selfe of my promise: which was, that I would yeeld vnto the Popes supremacie, if you prooued it by the sayings and iudgement of the Fathers, alleaged and applied rightly. For none of all thē which you haue alleaged, neither of any other church, nor of the Roman it self, doth auouch it. Whereby the shamelesse vanitie of 
                     Motiu. 14. 
                  Bristow may be séene: who, being not contented to say of all the Fathers, that they were Papists; addeth that in familiar talke among our selues we are not afeard plainely to confesse it. The Lord, who is witnesse of our thoughtes, and spéeches, knoweth that we are lewdly sclaundered herein. And for mine owne part, I am so farre off from confessing plainely that they were all Papists: that I haue plainly declared and confirmed not one of them to haue bene. For the very being and essence of a Papist consisteth in opinion of the Popes supremacie. But the Popes supremacie was not allowed by any of the Fathers. Not one then of al the Fathers was a Papist. Wherefore, if you haue the Fathers in such reuerent regard and estimatiō, as you pretend, M. Hart: let, if not the Scriptures, yet the Fathers moue you to forsake Papistrie; and giue to euery pastor and church their owne right, whereof Christ hath possessed them, and the Pope hath robbed them.

                     The first Diuisiō.
                  The Church doth acknowledge the doctrine of the Popes supremacie to be catholike. Wherefore you doe euill to touch it with the name of Papistrie. For 1. Tim. 3.15. 
                  the Church is the piller and ground of the truth.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  The Church is the pillar and ground of the truth, in office, and dutie: and 
                     Mal. 2. ver. 7. 
                  the Priest is the messenger of the Lord of hostes. But as 
                     ver. 8. there were Priestes, who did not their message in shewing Gods will: so there may be Churches, which shall not vpholde and mainetayne the truth.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, that is true still, which the Church teacheth. For S. Paul sayth not that it ought to be the piller & ground of the truth, but that it is so.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Neither doth Malachie say, that the Priest ought to be the messenger of the Lord of hostes, but that hée is so. And what is the occasion wherevpon S. Paule sayth that? and to whom?
            
            
               Hart.
               To Timothee: that he might know how he ought to conuerse in the house of God, which is the Church of the liuing God.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               
                  The Church then, which Timothee was conuersant in, and must behaue himselfe according to his charge in gouernment thereof, is called (by S. Paule) the piller and grounde of the truth.
               
            
            
               
               Hart.
               It is: and what then?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               But 1. Tim. 1.3. 
                  the Church which Timothee was conuersant in, was the Church of Ephesus. The Church of Ephesus then is called the piller and ground of the truth. Now 
                     Concil. Flor. Session. vlt. Laon. Chalcocondylas de rebus Turc. lib. 6. 
                  the Church of Ephesus hath condemned the doctrine of the Popes supremacie: nor only that Church, but other of the East too. Wherefore, if that be true still which the Church teacheth, because S. Paule calleth it the piller and ground of the truth: the doctrine of the Popes supremacie is wicked, and Papistrie is heresie.

               The Churches of the East haue erred therein. But the West alloweth it for catholike doctrine. And all the ancient Churches both of East and West did subscribe to it, vntill schisme and heresie had seuered them one from the other.

               That spéeche is as true as was the former of the Fathers. For, except the crew of the Italian faction, who haue aduanced the Pope that they might raigne with him, all Christian Churches haue condemned his vsurped soueraintie, and do till this day.

               True: if they were iustly condemned and excommunicate. But if their owne Bishop had dealt vniustly with them vpon some displeasure, and remoued them from the communion wrongfully; which you cannot denie but that he might do: then reason requireth that they should haue remedie. Now the remedie thereof is by appeale to the Pope.

               This remedie was deuised by new Physicians, that lacked worke: it increaseth diseases. The Nicen Physicians foreséeing the danger, prouided an other and better remedy for them.

               The cause to be heard in a Synode of Bishops, so to be decided by their common iudgement. For let it be examined (say they) whether the Bishop haue excommunicated them vpon a way wardnesse, or grudge, or too much rigour. Whereof that there may bee due examination, we haue thought good that in euery prouince two synods should be kept yerely: to the intent, that in common (all Bishops of the prouince being gathered together) such thinges may be examined. And so, whosoeuer shall be found in fault, and to haue bene dealt with iustly by the Bishop: lett them bee holden of all for excommunicate; till it shall seeme good to the Synode of Bishops to giue more gentle sentence of them.

               I grant, the Councell of Nice doth bring matters first from the Bishop to the Synode. But if the Synode also doe giue vniust sentence: then is the Pope left for the last refuge.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The Councell meant not so: but that the last refuge should be the Synode still. For they doe not say, till it shall seeme good to the Bishop of Rome, but, to the Synode of Bishops, to geue more gentle sentence of them. Yea, euen the particular honour and preeminence of his, which they mention, is a plaine token that they dreamed not of such a generall power. For it followeth straight in 
                     Can. 6. the next canon, Let old customes be kept, they that are in Egypt, and Lybia, and Pentapolis, that the Bishop of Alexandria haue the preeminence of all these: because such is the custome of the Bishop of Rome too. Likewise also in Antioche, and in other prouinces, let the

Churches enioy their dignities and prerogatiues. Which wordes of the Councell grounding on the custome of the Bishop of Rome, that as he had preeminence of all the Bishops about him, so Alexandria and Antioche should haue of all about thē, and likewise other churches, (as the Metropolitan,) ech in their owne prouinces: doe shew, that the Pope neither had preeminence of all through the world before the Nicen Councell, nor ought to haue greater preeminence (by their iudgement) then he before time had.
            
            
               Hart.
               Nay, the Councell did not limit the preeminence and power of the Church of Rome by those wordes: but they followed rather it as a paterne, in aduancing others. For the Nicen Councell, (sayth 
                     Epist. ad Michael. Imperatorem. Concilior. Tom. 3. Sur.
                   
                  Nicolas the first) durst not make any decree of that Church: as knowing that nothing could be giuen her aboue her desert; yea, that she had al things by the grant of Christ. And if the Councels canons bee diligently marked, you shall find doubtlesse, that they gaue no increase to the church of Rome: but rather tooke example of the forme therof for that which they would geue to the church of Alexandria.

But as a dronken man that hath a giddie head, entēding to go one way sometimes, doth reele an other: so fareth it with him. For, in saying that they tooke example of the forme of the Churche of Rome for that which they would giue to the Church of Alexandria: he granteth that as the Bishop of Alexandria had but the preeminence of all thereabout, no more had the Bishop of Rome. And séeing that example is allowed therein, and made a paterne of the rest: it followeth that the Councell thereby did decrée that the Bishop of Rome should kéepe within those limits.

                     •
                  rdemaine. For whereas Paschasinus (the Popes Legate there) bringing forth that canon to the Popes behoofe, had set this title ouer it, [
                     Quod ecclesia Romana semper 
                           •

                  That the Church of Rome hath still had the primacie:] the Iesuites suppressing quite the word [That] doe alleage the rest as a part of the canon.
            
            
               Hart.
               Perhaps they thought the word [That] to be superfluous.
            
            
               
               Rainoldes.
               They might haue thought the whole title to be so, if they had marked that which followeth in the Councel. For the same canon being recited straight out of an other copie by Constantine the Secretarie, hath no word therof. But to leaue the dealing of the Popes legate with the beginning of the canon: the Iesuites cannot scape out of the midst of it, no more then their complices. For the Roman reader is entangled in it as fast as Pope Nicolas, whose forme he relieth on.

               Whether that title were added to the canon by the Popes Legate, or were a part thereof, it maketh no matter. The primacie named in it was giuen to the Pope by the Councel of Nice. For though in the common volumes of Councels there be but twentie canons of theirs extant now: yet they made fourescore. By many of the which the Pope is autorised to iudge all greater causes, as 
                     Rescript. Iul. Pap. contra Orient. Concil. Tom. 1. 
                  Iulius declareth. Yea, the fourescore canons whole were found of late at Alexandria in the Arabian toung: and turned into Latin out of the Arabian by a learned Iesuite. Therein are Patriarkes sayd to rule all their subiectes, as the Pope is head of all Patriarkes, like Peter: to whom all power is geuen ouer all Christian Princes, and ouer all their peoples, as being Christs vicar ouer all nations of the earth.

               Our ancestours had a reuerent opinion of the Pope, long after S. Gregorie, for S. Gregories sake: and honoured him aboue all Bishops. But when he began to reach out the pawes of his supremacie ouer thē, in giuing Church-liuings▪ and handling Church-causes, and executing Church-censures: they were so farre frō liking it, that

That I might say iustly, that, except the crew of the Italian factiō, (wherein I comprehend the Iesuites, and their complices, men Italianate,) al Christian Churches haue condemned the Popes supremacie, & do till this day. Wherefore if the matter were to be tried by the will of men: so many thousandes of them, Pastours and Doctours, Synodes and Coūcels, Uniuersities and Churches, through all ages, in all countries, of al sorts, and states, might suffice to put the Pope from his supremacie. At least they might make you to blush, M. Hart, who haue sayd in 
                     Chapt. 7. Diuis. 7. writing, that all men did

grant it him without resistance, & it was neuer denied him. But sith it must be tried by the word of God, and it is not writen in the booke of life. I conclude, that it is not a citizen of Ierusalem, but a child of Babylon, which they shall be blessed who dash against the stones. And thus haue I shewed that the former point, on which you refuse to communicate with vs in prayers and religion, ought to bring you rather to vs, then draw you from vs. It remaineth now that we sift the later: of the faith professed in the Church of England. Which if it be found to be the Catholike faith, as in truth it will: then is there no cause but you must néedes yéeld, that we may go together into the house of the Lord.

                  HART.
               Nay, first,
                     The first Diuisiō.
                   why doe you take the supremacie from the Pope, and giue it to the Prince who is lesse capable of it?
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The supremacie, which we take from the Pope, M. Hart, we giue to no mortall creature, Prince, nor other. But the Pope hauing seazed on part of Christs right, part of Princes, part of Bishops, part of peoples & Churches; as the chough (in Aesope) did trick vp himselfe with the feathers of other birdes: the feather, which the Romish chough had of our Princes, we haue taken from him, and geuen it to her Maiestie to whom it belonged; according to the lesson of our heauenly Master, 
                     Mat. 22.21. 
                  Geue to Caesar the thinges which are Caesars, and to God the things which are Gods.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               It is not Caesars right to be the supreme gouernour of all his dominions in things spirituall and temporall. But this is the supremacie which you giue our soueraine Lady Quéene Elisabeth. Therfore you giue the Prince more thē i

                   the Princes.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               To haue the preeminence ouer all rulers in gouernment

of matters touching God and man within his owne dominions, is to be supreme gouernour of all his dominions in thinges spirituall and temporall. But 1. Pet. 2.13. it is 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  Caesars right 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  to haue the preeminence ouer all rulers in gouernment of matters touching God and man within his owne dominions. Therefore that is the Princes which we giue the Prince.
            
            
               Hart.
               The Prince hath preeminence ouer al rulers within his owne dominions in gouernment of matters touching man, not God. For nether he nor any of the rulers vnder him may deale in them both.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               They may. For 
                     Rom. 13.3.

                     . Pet. 2.14. the ciuil magistrate is ordeined to punish them that doe euill, and praise them that doe well. But the euill to be punished, and the good to be praised, compriseth all duties, not only towardes man, but towards God also. Therefore the ciuill magistrate is ordeined to gouerne in duties touching God and man.
            
            
               Hart.
               The good that we must follow, and euill that wée must flie, compriseth duties to them both. But that which the ciuill magistrate must deale with, is good and euill in thinges of men, not of God; in ciuill cases, not religion.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The scripture sayth the contrary. For it sheweth that offenders in cases of religion,

                     Rom. 13.4. who beareth not the sword in vaine. Then is the ciuill magistrate to punish euill doers in things concerning God. Now, wherein he hath to punish, and reward, therein he hath to gouerne. He hath to gouerne therefore in things concerning God and man.
            
            
               Hart.
               Why sayth the scripture then, that 
                     Heb.

               Rainoldes.
               To do them, M. Hart: as it followeth in the text, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sinnes. For this is the peculiar dutie of the Priests. Which if the Prince meddle with, as 2. Chron. 26. ver. 16. 
                  Ozias did, who would haue burnt incense, vpon the altar of incense, 
                  
                     ver. 18. a thing enioyned to Priests only: then transgresseth he the bounds of his office, 
                     ver. 19. and prouoketh vengeance of the Lord vpon him. But to prouide by ciuil punishments, and

orders, that Priests do their dutie in things concerning God, nor only Priests, but people too: it is the Princes charge; and so is he ordeined to deale in things of God. For,

                     Allen in his Apologie. chapt. 4. Maister layeth open the weakenesse of ye grounds which you pretend for Princes right out of the Scriptures. For Caesar was an Heathen when 
                     Mat. 22.21. 
                  Christ & his

                  Apostles did teach the faithful to obey him. So that, if he were supreme gouernour of his subiects in things spirituall and temporall: then must hée be obeyed as in temporall matters, so in spirituall too.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               True. And therefore 
                     Act. 25.11▪
                   
                  Paule appealed to him, as knowing that the Iewes ought to haue obeyed him, if hée had iudged with the truth.
            
            
               Hart.
               The Iewes 
                  
                     Act. 24.5. had accused Paule of sedition, as well as of heresie. And therefore his case was not spirituall méerely. But if the Heathen Emperour were to be obeyed in spirituall matters: then must the Christians haue sacrificed to idols. For so he did commaund them.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Why? If the heathen Emperour had commaunded them to beare false witnesse against their neighbour, or to condemne the innocent thereby, 1. King. 21.10. as Iezabel did: must Christians haue obeyed him?
            
            
               Hart.
               No: because, in things forbidden by God, that is a generall rule, that 
                     Act. 5.29. 
                  we must rather obey God then men.
               
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               Then as the Heathen Emperour must not be obeyed if he commaunded things vniust, and yet was supreme gouernour (you grant) in temporal matters: so in spiritual matters might he haue that soueraintie; yet not to be obeyed, if hée commaunded things vngodly.
            
            
               Hart.
               But Princes are so mightie that if they commaund them, men wil obey them commonly. As whē 
                  
                     Dan. 3. ver. 5. the King of Babylon commanded men to worship the image of gold, 
                  
                     ver. 12. there were but thrée who disobeyed him.
            
            
               Rainoldes.
               The better were those thrée tried: and through their triall 
                     ver. 28. God glorified. Wherefore though Princes cōman
                     •
                   not things godly, as nether honest, alwaies: we must not therfore robbe them of soueraintie therein; but helpe them with our 1. Tim. 2.2. 
                  praiers, that they may gouerne vs in godlinesse & honestie.
               
            
            
               Hart.
               Yet experiēce sheweth, that, if they haue this soueraintie, religion will be changed ofte with change of rulers. As if is the 
                     •
                  urpitude of our nation through the whole world, that of foure Princes who haue succéeded one an other, the first kept the ancient faith, though not the Papacie: the next abolished both;

                  Iosias, his nephew, abolished thē againe. Yet the Prophets were not moued by these changes to denie their soueraintie in matters of religion. And better it is for vs to haue changed so, by meanes of our godly Iosias, and Ezekias, that noble child her Maiesties brother, & her Maiestie: then to haue continued vnchanged, as our ancestours; vnder the Pope, as

               Hart.
               I haue proued it alredy in part. For ye Catholike faith is ye which we professe in ye Church of Rome. You professe not ye. As ye points yt you haue touched by ye way, of scriptures, of traditiōs, of merits, of sacramēts, of Priesthoode, of the Masse, the real presēce, the worship of Saints, & sūdry others shew. But I wil cōfer no farder herof, vnles I haue greter assurāce of my life.

               Assurance of your life to procéede in cōferēce (by Gods grace) you haue. At least, as great assurance as hetherto you haue had. But you should rather say, you wil conferre no farder vnlesse you had better assurance of your cause. For that is the catholike faith which the Apostles did preach to al nations. The Apostles preached that which is writen in the holy scriptures. Therefore, that, which is writen, is the catholike faith. But the faith, which we professe, is all writen. The faith which we professe then, is the Catholike faith. And this should appéer
                     •
                   as well in other pointes, as in those alreadie touched, if you would sift them. The Lord grant you grace to consider of it: that whatsoeuer become of your life temporall, you may haue assurance of eternall life, through knowledge of his holy truth.
            
         
         
            
            SIX CONCLVSIONS touching THE HOLY SCRIPTVRE AND THE CHVRCH.
            Proposed, expounded, and defended, in publike disputations at Oxford, by Iohn Rainoldes.
            1 The holy scripture teacheth the Church all things necessarie to saluation.
            2 The militant Church may erre, both in maners, and in doctrine.
            3 The authoritie of the holy scripture is greater, then the authoritie of the Church.
            4 The holy Catholike Church, which wee beleeue, is the whole company of Gods elect and chosen.
            5 The Church of Rome is not the Catholike Church, nor a sound member of the Catholike Church.
            6 The reformed Churches in England, Scotland, Fraunce, Germanie, and other kingdomes and common-weales, haue seuered themselues lawfully from the Church of Rome.

               WHen Anna the mother of Samuel had brought vp her child, whom she had obtained of God with earnest prayers to put from her selfe the reproch of barennesse: she consecrated him to God before Eli the Priest, 1. Sam. 1.28. & 2.18.that he might liue and serue in the temple of the Lord. In like maner I desiring to consecrate to the temple of the Lord my Samuel, as it were, & the first child of trauaile that God hath geuen to my barrennes, haue thought good to present him to God before you, fathers, and brethren, welbeloued in Christ, who either are already or shall be put in trust with the charge of the temple, to serue (if it may any way) 2. Cor. 6.16. 
               the temple of the liuing God. Perhaps a rash enterprise, & vndertaken somewhat more boldly, then aduisedly: chiefly séeing that it is so far inferior to the ripenes of Samuel. And truely I haue hetherto béene stil of ye minde, that I had leiffer the things which I had brought foorth (rather as vntimely fruites, then perfit children) should be kept within, then come abroad into the light; & stay in the court of the temple, then presse into the temple. For I haue béen dealt with both oft, and earnestly, by my very frends, that I would suffer to be printed and published, as other sclender exercises made rather for the fence-schoole (as you would say) then for the field: so chiefly my Orations, which, when I read the Gréeke lecture in our College. I made to mine audience cōcerning the studies of humanitie and philosophie. Which yet I haue refrained to doo, not of enuie, for I haue addicted my selfe to wish well vnto the Church & common wealth; neither of vnkindnes, as though I were not willing to gratif

Howbeit, after that I was discharged of that profession of artes of humanitie, that I might the better applie the studie of diuinitie: what before of bashfulnes and iudgement I had still refrained to doo in things of lesse importance, least I should doo it more rawly then I thought méete; the duetie which I owe to God and his Church hath mooued me now to do that in a weightie matter, though not so ripely as I would. Which thing, vndertaken both by the aduise and the request of the godly, I was occasioned to thinke off by one Richard Bristow, an Englishman borne, abiding at Doway, professing the Romish faith: who hath set foorth a poisoned worke against the faith and Church of Iesus Christ, the faith which we professe, the Church of which we be. That worke, entitled Motiues to the catholike faith, when first he set it foorth, he hath abridged since into a pamphlet of Demaundes to be proponed of catholikes to heretikes, and printed it againe: setting before vs the same vnsauory Coleworts, twise sodden by himselfe, a thousand times by Popish cookes, to the great anoyance of guestes, if they féede on it; great loathing, if they féede not. What a gréeuous iniury therein be hath doon to the Church of England, nor only to the whole bodie thereof, but to the seuerall partes also, by raysing vp vntrue and wicked surmises, by casting out reprochfull spéeches, by laying heresies to our charge: it shalbe declared (as I heare) shortly; in the meane season let the godly iudge: whiles, to beginne with our most gratious Queene, the daughter of godlinesse, the defender of the faith▪ the mainteiner of peace, the nurse of the Church, the preseruer of the weale publik

Now, these false and sclaunderous spéeches against our Church, wherewith he hath besette his worke in sundry places as with precious stones, are vnderlaide with reasons against our Churches faith, begotten of the same

But when I had prepared my selfe to the battaile, and chosen smooth stones out of the brooke of Gods worde, 2.

Whose worke (as I vnderstood since) is at the presse too, and shall be shortly published. Wherefore laying now aside my former purpose, I thought on that demaund and promise of Bristow touching the scripture and the Church, wherein he doth challenge and offer vs the combat. For whereas a countrie man of ours, vnder the title of an vnlearned Christian, (concealing his own name,) had set foorth a booke touching the autoritie of Gods word &

                  Demaund. 34. 
               Bristow willeth him to set out his booke, and put his name to it, with approbation of our Rabbines, and with priuilege, and promiseth that he shal quickly see it answered. This booke haue I sought for, but could not fall vpon it, all the copies of it (as I ghesse) being sold. Neither knew I how to speake with the autor, who had cōcealed his name, I dout not but for good cause. But to satisfie, (if not wholy, yet as farre as I might) the chalēge of Bristow: I haue set out this litle treatise of the same point, with ye autours name thereto, & approbation, not of Rabbines, (whom we leaue to that Synagogue whose

Which thing I hope will like him so much the better, because it compriseth not onely that question touching the scripture and the Church that he desireth to be set out, but certaine other also of the same kinde, chiefly touching the Church, whereof he hath onely the bare name to boast of. And I looke for an answere so much the sooner, because there are now fower yeares past, since In the title of his booke of Demaundes.
                he promised a Latin booke: to which whether it be come abroad already, or to come shortly, he may ioine (if it please him) an answere to these Conclusions. Wherein if he thinke it méete for him to deale, there are thrée things both easy to be doon, and reasonable (in my iudgement)

which I will request him. One is, that he will set downe the text of my Conclusions wholy with his answere, (as I had determined to doo with his Demaundes,) that the readers may sée, what he confuteth, and how. An other, that he will not kicke against the prickes: that he will yéelde to the truth and not go about to darken the cléere light of the sunne of righteousnes with cauils and sclanders. The thirde, that if he be ashamed to say, the truth preuails against me: yet in reprouing such things as he assayeth to reproue, he will deale more soundly and sincerely then D. Stapleton hath doon in his Doctrinall Principles of faith, a worke more full of wordes then truth. For to confute our doctrine,

                  Cic. in Anton. Philip. 2. when the Senate had ratified the actes of Caesar, he added to Caesars acts what he listed, and would haue it to stand as sure as if Caesar him selfe had enacted it. But that the opinion it selfe is a bastard (whosoeuer begot it, an heretike or an Heathen) and therefore to be shut out of

               the Lordes assemblie, which bastardes are forbidden to enter into, my first Conclusion sheweth: wherein I haue declared that the holy scripture teacheth the Church all thinges necessarie to saluation.
            
            Now, the Papists, being cast downe from this bulwarke, retyre vnto the Church,

The aduise of Bishops, the Roman iudges, hath béene asked, whether she might mary superstitions and idols by the law of Christ. The Bishops haue caused the scriptures to be serched, and they finde no law whereby the worship of idols and superstitions is permitted: but an other law they haue found yet which prouideth that the Church can not erre in decreeing any thing.

Wherefore to ouerthrow the ruinous walles both of the house, and the foundation, I haue set the second Conclusion against it: which proueth manifestly that the militant Church may erre not in maners only, but in doctrine too.

Which prophecie hath béene fulfilled in their eyes, who haue séene Antichrist preferred before Christ: & they haue séene Antichrist preferred before Christ, who haue séene the Church aduanced aboue the scripture. For what is detracted from the scripture, the worde of Christ; that is in déede detracted from Christ, the autour of the word.

               a denne of theeues. Dooth Esay speake against the Psalmist, or Christ against Salomon? No, but the Psalmist sheweth

what Ierusalem was, in his time: Esay, what in his. 
                  Esai. 1.21. 
               The faithfull citie is become an harlot: it was a faithfull citie, but it is become an harlot. Salomon teacheth what the house of God ought to be: Christ, what it is made. 
                  Matt. 21.13. 
               You haue made it a denne of theues: it was not to Salomon, but you haue made it. So Rome was likewise sound in the time of the Fathers, but the faithfull citie is become an harlot: the soundnes it hath lost, it hath got a leprousie: it was the house of God, it is a denne of théeues: it held 
                  Rom. 1.8. 
               the faith of Christ, but it is fallen from it. It had kept the doctrine still which was deliuered by the Apostles, vntill the time of Irenaeus: but that it hath kept still vntil our time the doctrin which was deliuered by the Apostles, doth it thereof folow? Unlesse perhaps the Popes Courtiers will proue, that the whoores, the Courtisans which keepe their stewes, are virgins, because they were virgins when they were litle babes. The former Fathers then, who deny that ye 
               church of Rome did erre, doo not gainsay vs. The later, who deny that it may erre, gainsay vs in deed: but they gainesay ye holy Ghost too. By whose inspiration the blessed Apostle exhorting the Roman church not to lift vp it selfe against the Iewes: 
               
                  Rom. 11.20. 
               Be not high minded (saith he) but feare. For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed least he also spare not thee. Behold there fore the bountifulnes and seueritie of God: seueritie toward thē which haue fallen; but toward thee, bountifulnes, if thou continue in his bountifulnes: or els thou shalt also be cut off. The church of Rome therefore may be cut of: if cut of, then erre: if erre, then vnfaithfulnes may haue accesse vnto it. What? and was Cyprian of an other minde? Pardon me O Cyprian: I would beléeue thée gladly, but that beléeuing thee I should not beléeue the word of God. But whether we should rather beléeue, God, or man: let the Papists iudge. At least, if they beléeue rather man then God: let them beléeue the reason and iudgement of their owne men. For

or to beléeue God with a holy faith, as God hath commanded; sith the Church of Rome being taken with contagious diseases & a frensy, did put her counsellers to the fyer, frends to the sword, brethren to cruell death, and stained the faith of Christ with reproches, creatures with the Lordes honour, Gods seruice with idolatrie: we went away from Papists, not willingly, as from men; not vnwillingly, as from heretikes; and reforming our Churches by the rule of Gods worde, we seuered them from the contagion of the Church of Rome. Wherin because nothing was doon by our brethren, but that which the Apostle S. Paul, a chosen instrument of the holy Ghost, both 
                  Act. 19.9. did, and 1. Tim. 6.5. 1. Cor. 6.17. taught to be doon, as I haue proued in the Conclusion: the Lord shal iudge beweene our Churches and

               with the Romans, did cause certaine couples of captiues to fight one with an other hand to hand, before he set his souldiers in battaile aray: that his Carthaginians might, by that pastime of the captiues combat, addresse them selues with better consideration and courage to the serious and set battaile. In like sorte there haue béene brought before you (gentle audience) to the combat sundrie opinions of sundrie artes, as it were cooples of captiues: which whether they liue or dye, be so or not so, it skilleth not greatly; the state of the realme is not ventured vpon it. But now from that sporting conflict of light matters there cometh to the battaile for earnest tryall of thinges of weight, host against host, truth against falshood, religion against errour: wherein if

we swarue out of the right way, it is the death not of captiues, but of Carthaginians; not opinions of men, but the truth of God is hazarded; not life, not health, not wealth and possessions, but the inheritance of heauen and saluation cometh into controuersie. Lend me therefore (I pray you) the presence of your mindes, and patience of your eares, to that which shall be spoken: remembring that we haue, not toyes, as on a stage, but serious thinges in hand. And because we handle the matters of the Lord, I pray him to sanctifie with his holy spirit our tongues, and your eares, and the mindes of all: that neither we dispute to any other end then to bring foorth the truth into light by conference of reasons; neither you in hearing haue any other minde then to beléeue the truth when it shalbe brought foorth, and proued.
            To beginne therefore with the first Conclusion,
               
                  The first conclusiō.
                and so runne ouer the rest briefly: the holy scripture teacheth the Church all things necessarie to saluation. God the father of eternall goodnes and mercy did choose of his frée and singular fauour (before the foundations of the world were laide) a great number of men, whom he would indue with euerlasting life, and make them heires of heauenly glory. Now, that the chosen might come to this inheritance: they were to be made the children of God by adoption through Iesus Christ. For this hath euer béene the onely way to saluation. In consideration whereof, the holy ghost, speaking of the company of such as God hath chosen, termeth them 
                  Rom. 8. ver. 16. sometime the children of God, by adoption, not by nature, yet

               which the gates of hell shall not preuaile against. This Church then, euen the company of the elect and chosen, the children of God, the wife of the Lambe, the body of Christ, the citizens of heauen, that is to say, the holy Catholike Church; as it is chosen and ordained by God to life euerlasting: so hath it béene alwayes taught by his worde the way of saluation, whereby it might come to the possession of that life. His word being vttered in old time sundry wayes, was published at

length in writing. And so it came to passe that the holy writinges of God did teach the Church such thinges as must be knowne for the obteining of saluation. For who could reueale the way to obtaine the inheritance of the kingdom of God, but God alone? And he reueled it to his Church, as first without writing, in such sort as séemed best to his wisdome; so afterwarde in writing, by the hand of his seruants inspired with the holy Ghost: without writing, to Adam, and from Adams time till Moses; in writing, to Moses and from Moses forwarde till the ende of the world. Wherfore in these writings giuen out by the holy Ghost, and penned by the seruants of God, which writings S. 
               2. Tim. 3.26. 
               Paul calleth scripture, by an excellencie, as you would say the writings which surpasse all others: the way of saluation whereby wee come to heauen, the light of our soules which shineth in this worlds darkenesse, the foode of life which nourisheth vs to grow in Christ, is deliuered to the Church. For cléerer proofe whereof, let vs diuide the Church into the olde and the new: the olde, before Christ; the new, since Christ was borne. The Prophets taught the old Church the way of saluation: the Apostles with the Prophets together teach the new more plenteously and fully. The doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles is comprised in the holy scripture. The scripture therefore teacheth the Church whatsoeuer is behoofefull to saluation. For the Church is the company of the elect and chosen. Now they who are elect, are 
                  Eph. 2. ver. 19 
               of the houshold of God: and they of his houshold 
                  ver. 20. 
               are built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophetes, Iesus Christ himselfe being the chiefe corner stone. But, this foundation of the Apostles and Prophets is the doctrine touching Christ which they preached to the Church. And that doctrine which they preached is enrolled in scripture. Wherefore the scripture teacheth the Church all thinges that for saluation are requisite to be knowne. Moses (to beginne with the first of the Prophets) hauing published the law of God to the Israelites: 
                  Deut. 4.2. & 12.32. 
               Giue eare (saith he) O Israel to the ordinances which I teach. Ye shall not adde to the worde which I command you, nor shall you take from it: but whatsoeuer I command you, that shall ye obserue to doo, that ye may keepe the commandements of the Lord your God. Now the Israelites were to labour for the obtaining of saluation. But they might do nothing

which was not prescribed by the law of God. Therefore the writen law of God did deliuer whatsoeuer was needfull for the saluation of the Israelites. And there is no dout but the Israelites were the Church. The law then did teach whatsoeuer was needfull for the saluation of the Church. The Prophets, who folowed, were expounders of the law: that as they were inspired with the same spirit by which Moses wrote, so they neither added any thing to his law, nor tooke from it; onely they vnfolded it to the edifying of the Church, as it séemed best to the holy ghost.

But these thinges could not haue beene spoken by God or the seruants of God, vnlesse the law of Moses had shewed the whole and perfit way of saluation. The law of Moses therefore did wholy and perfitly instru

                the Church therein. Which if the law of Moses did performe alone: much more all the Prophets together with Moses. How may it then be douted, but the olde Church was taught out of the scriptures the way of saluation wholly and perfitly? S. Iohn (to passe ouer from the Prophets to the Apostles) after that the sunne of righteousnesse was risen, not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it, and to bring a brighter and cléerer light into the worlde, declareth in the gospell how Iesus Christ our Sauiour, doing the office of our soueraine Prophet, Priest, and King, accomplished our saluation, by teaching, by dying, by rising from the dead. Our saluation then is fully wrought by Christ. But is it fully written by S. Iohn? Let vs heare him selfe speake. 
                  Iohn 20.31. 
               These things (saith he) are writen, that ye may beleeue that Iesus is the Christ, the sonne of God, and that in beleeuing yee may haue life through his name. In which wordes the summe and end of the gospell is set downe by Iohn: the summe, that we may beleeue that Iesus is the Christ,

                  . 
               the Christ, that is, the soueraine Priest, Prophet, and King, the Sauiour of men: the end, that we beleeuing in

Christ, the sonne of God, may through him haue life, euen that which alone is called life rightly, to wit, eternall life. Which things being so, as the Euangelist him selfe teacheth: it must néedes be granted, that those things which are writen in the gospell are sufficient for vs, both to the way of life, and to life. As much then as sufficeth to faith and saluation, so much is writen in the gospell. For if the things which are writen had not béene sufficient to faith, and saluation, there were

                  , which might haue bene writen, so many as the world could not haue conteined. But these were omitted by the spirit of God, because the other were enough for his purpose. For he giueth this reason why mo were not writen: these things are writen that yee may beleeue, and in beleeuing may haue life. There is contained therefore in S. Iohns gospell so much as is sufficient to faith and saluation. Then if S. Iohns gospell alone haue sufficient: how plentifully hath Christ prouided for his Church, as a most bountifull Lord for his houshold, to which he hath giuen so many Apostles, and Euangelists, witnesses and expounders of the same doctrine? Wherefore the scripture doth not onely teach the Church, but also amply and plentifully teach it, all things behoofull to saluation. For although the substance of the Christian faith be single and the same, wherewith as with meate the seruants of God are fedde to life eternall: yet, as the ages of the seruants differ, and in ages different their cases differ too; so was it méete there should be sundry sortes and waies to diuide that meate, and as it were to season it, for ech one his part as it might best agrée with him. Whereof that we might haue a true & liuely paterne set foorth by Christs owne spirit in the word of life for the féeding of the faithfull: therefore hée gaue sundry woorkemen (so to terme them) and writers of his faith, that although they deliuered all the same foode, yet they did not dresse it all in one sort. And so it cometh to passe, that, in those writers of the faith of Christ, both the vnitie of doctrine in the diuersitie of deliuering yeldeth a swéete tast in the spirituall mouth of the godly minde; and the manifold vse ministreth holesome nourishment to euery mans stomake; & the euident plainnesse in the groundes of faith maketh that euen they who are of deintiest mouthes can not refuse it for the toughnes; and the hidden wisedome in the secretes of scripture both trieth the strongest, and satisfieth them

who are sharpest set; and (to say that in a word which no wordes can expresse enough) the infinite treasures bring infinite fruits to the faithfull, to procure them a blessednes that is exceeding great and infinite. Wherefore it is a thing so cléere, and so sure, that those secretaries of the holy Ghost (ioyned togither) doo open to the Church in the holy scriptures all things behoofefull to saluation: that he, who knoweth it not, may be iustly counted ignorant; hée who acknowledgeth it not, lewde; hée who dissembleth it, vnthankfull; hée who denieth it, more then wicked. For what can there be in cléerenesse more euident, or in peise more weightie, or in strength more sound, or in truth more certaine, then that generall principle which S. Paul deliuereth, not as Moses, of the law; not as Iohn, of the gospell; but of the whole scripture and holy writt, to Timothee: 
               2. Tim. 3.16. 
               The whole scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, to instruct in righteousnes, that the man of God may bee furnished, throughly furnished to euery good worke. Thus, if you demaund of what autoritie scripture is, it came from God by inspiration; if you regard what vse it hath, it teacheth, improueth, correcteth, instructeth; if you would sée to what end, it is, that the man of God may be furnished. Our dutie in Christ Iesus, is

                  . 
               faith woorking by loue. Faith embraceth sound doctrine: loue requireth a godly life. Soundnes of doctrine is held, if true things be taught, and false refuted. Godlines of life is kept, if we fly from euill, and folow good. But the holy scripture teacheth the truth; improueth errour; correcteth iniquitie; instructeth to righteousnes: as it appéereth by the Apostles wordes. Therefore it setteth foorth a mans whole dutie in Christ Iesus: that is, (as I suppose,) so much as sufficeth to saluation. For it is not onely profitable to these things, (as some doo mince the matter,) but sufficient too: in so much that it is 2. Tim. 3.15. 
               able to make a man wise to saluation through faith, and to furnish him. Yea, to furnish what maner of man? the man of God: that is, the Lordes interpreter, the Minister of the worde, the teacher of the Church, the Pastour of the flocke, euen 1. Tim. 6.1

                  . 
               Timothee himselfe: much more the flock of the faithfull, in whom so great furniture of wisdome is not necessary. Howbeit the Apostle neither so contented with saying, that the man of God may be furnished: addeth (to beat the absolute

perfection of the scripture into our mindes and memories, (with as many reasons, as he vseth wordes,) that the man of God may be

               throughly furnished, to euerie good worke. Whereupon it foloweth that there is nothing at all that can be wished for, either to soundnes and sinceritie of faith, or to integritie and godlines of life, that is, to mans perfection, and the way of saluation: which the scripture geuen by inspiration of God doth not teach the faithfull seruantes of Christ. It is the iudgement therefore of the holy Ghost, whose sentence I defend, as I am bound by duetie: that the holy scripture teacheth the Church all things necessarie to saluation. Here, if some perhaps desire the testimonies of the Fathers, though, to what purpose, sith ye haue heard the Father of Fathers? notwithstanding, if any would heare the scholers iudgement when he hath heard the masters, he shall heare the iudgement not of this or that man of whom he might dout, but of the whole Church and of all the Saints. For they, with one agréement and generall consent, haue termed the bookes of scripture, Canonicall, of the word Canon, which signifieth a rule: because they containe a worthy rule and squire of religion, faith, and godlines, according whereunto the building of the house of God must be fitted.

               Epiphanius, assaying all sortes of helpes against heretikes, will haue certaine things to be contained in traditions, whereto by the iudgement of scripture it selfe there must no lesse credit be geuen then to scripture: I take not vpon me to controll them, but let the Church iudge, whether they considered with aduise inough those sayings of S. Paul, by which they were induced perhaps to this opinion, at least they séeke to prooue it. For Epiphanius groundeth vpon these wordes of his to the Corinthians: 
               1. Cor 11.2. 
               as I deliuered to you; and, I haue deliuered so in the Churches; and, 1. Cor. 15.1. 
               if ye keepe it, except ye haue beleeued in vaine. And Basil gathereth it to be Apostolike doctrine, (that we must hold fast vnwriten traditions,) by his wordes to the Thessalonians: 
               2. Thes. 2.15. 
               hold the traditions which ye haue been taught either by word or by our epistle. Now if S. Paul meant in both these places by [deliuered] and [traditions] his doctrine, deliuered to them by word of mouth, yet comprised in scripture too: then must it be granted that they were deceiued who thought that vnwriten traditions were approoued by S. Pauls traditions. But the former point is true, that he meant so. Therefore the later also is true which foloweth of it. For he dooth expound it himselfe, to the Corinthians, considering that 1. Cor.

                he writeth the summe of those things which he had deliuered; and, what 1. Cor. 11.2
                     •
                  . 
               he deliuered, that he receiued (he saith) of the Lord; and 
                  Luk. 22.19. that which he receiued of the Lord, is writen; and in plaine termes 1. Cor. 15.3. he witnesseth himselfe to haue deliuered that vnto them, which he had receiued according to the scriptures, to weet, that Christ died for our sinnes according to the scriptures, and that he was buried and that hee rose the third day according to the scriptures. As for the Thessalonians, what the things were, which he deliuered vnto them by word, it is shewed in the
                  Act. 17.2. actes of the Apostles: where we reade that Paul being come to Thessalonica, taught the Iewes out of the scriptures, that it behooued Christ to suffer, and to

rise again from the dead, and that this Iesus whom (said he) I preach to you, is the Christ. In which words it is opened both what Paul deliuered to the Thessalonians by word, and from whence: from whence? out of the scriptures: what? that it behooued Christ to suffer, and rise againe, and that Iesus is 
               As before, Ioh. 20.31. 
               the Christ. The tradition therefore, which Paul dooth exhort the Thessalonians to hold, is the tradition of the gospell, as 
                  Amb. in 2. ad Thes. cap. 2. 
               Ambrose calleth it very wel. Which the reason also doth proue, that Ambrose noteth, that Paul doth there gather: 2. Thess. 2. ver. 14. 
               God hath raysed you to saluation by our gospell; 
               
                  ver. 15. 
               therefore stand ye fast, and hold the traditions which ye haue been taught either by word or by our epistle: as if he should say, see therefore that ye stand stedfast in the gospell, which I, as well by word of mouth as by writing, haue deliuered to you. Thus S. Pauls traditions are the gospel deliuered. And the gospel (I hope) is writen. Therfore S. Pauls traditions are writen. But the saluation of ye 
               Thessalonians was contained in the traditions which S. Paul had taught them by word & by epistle. The scripture then informeth the Church of so much as is necessary to saluation. Wherfore auant heretikes out of ye schoole of Christ, ye Valentinians, Marcionites, and Gnostikes: who (as 
                  Aduers. haer. lib. 3. c. 2.

               Church in Gréeke (the natiue language of the new testament) cometh from a verbe which signifyeth to call out, thereby to note a company called out, as you would say. So that the Church of Christ be tokeneth a company called out from amongst the multitude of other men to life euerlasting through faith in Christ Iesus. But they who are called out of the refuse and filth of mankinde to this state and honour, are not of one sort all. For same of them are called effectually, and doo come: some, that are called, doo not yéeld them selues obedient to the calling. They whom God hath chosen, are called, and doo come: they, who being called come not, are not chosen. That spéech of our Sauiour Christ doth touch them both: 
                  Mat. 20.16. 
               many are called, but few are chosen. The many, that are called, are named the Church: but (to speake distinctly for instructions sake) the visible Church: because we sée the companies of men which are called to the faith of Christ, which professe that they would enioy eternall life. The few, that are chosen, are named the church also, but the church inuisible: not for that we sée not those whom God hath chosen, but because we can not discerne by sight who be the chosen; only the Lord knoweth who are his. Now, of this Church which we call inuisible, parte is in present possession of heauenly glory, part not hauing yet attained thereunto abideth on the earth. That part which is entred into the ioy of their Lord, is commonly termed the triumphant Church: the other which lyeth in campe and wayteth for the victory, is called the Church militant. But as it falleth out in campes of worldly warfare, that eyther for couetousnes,

or feare, or fauour, there are with faithfull souldiers such as are vnfaithfull, some who neuer minde to come into the field, some who will betray their felowes to their foes, some readie to stirre vp the souldiers to mutinies, some perhaps that traiterously will set vpon their owne captaine: so the militant church, which hath none but faithfull souldiers of Christ in that respect that it is matched with the Church triumphant, yet, while it abideth in the campe of warfare, there hang about it slipp

               Bernard saith, They are in Christes liuery, but they do seruice vnto Antichrist. Sith therefore to discerne the faithfull souldiers from vnfaithful it belongeth to him alone who shal one day seuer the shéepe frō the goats: we, measuring a souldier by the profession that hée maketh, & othe that bindeth him to warfare, call that the militant Church which is inrolled & billed to serue vnder Christ, part wherof doth faithfully sight the Lords battailes, part making shew to serue him doo fight the battailes of the deuill. And this is the militant Church which I meane in the point proposed: the militant Church may erre both in maners and in doctrine. To the ripping vp whereof we must obserue, that it is proper to God alone by nature, to be holy, true, perfit, and free from errours: as contrari-wise man by nature is vncleane, a lyer, vnperfit, prone to deceiue and be deceiued. For 
                  Rom. 3.4. 
               euery man is a lyer: God alone is true. And 
                  Mark. 10.18. 
               none is good but God: he is naught therefore that is a méere man. But of grace God bestoweth vpon man the gift of perfection, holines, and truth, as it were a beame of the sunne shining into a house of clay, to giue vs light and warmth. Howbeit this beame, though the more the sunne of righteousnes ascēdeth and cometh daily néerer vs, the greater light and warmth it yeldeth: neuerthelesse it shal not ouershine vs with full light of truth, and warmth of holines, vntill we be taken out of our houses of clay, and go into the open heauen vnto God. The militant Church hath the beames of the sunne, but as in a house, not in the open heauen: sometimes it is shadowed and made dimme with darknes, sometimes it waxeth faint through cold. The triumphant Church hath the sunne it selfe, not within doores, but a broad; not on earth, but in heauen: where neither any darknes doth hinder the light, nor any cold abate

the warmth. Thus it is made proper to the Church triumphant, to be without all spot: as the spowse is told (in the song of Salomon) by her welbeloued, speaking thus vnto her; 
                  Cant. 4.7. 
               thou being all faire, my loue, and no spot in thee, shalt come with me from Lebanon, O spouse, with me from Lebanon. For thereby wée learne that as soone as the Church being fully cleansed from spot of all errours shall haue attained that excellent fairenesse and perfection, whereto she is fyned by litle and litle in this life: she is taken out of Lebanon, (as you would say, the forest) of this world, and ioyned to her bridegrome in that blessed mariage, to enioy eternall glory with God. But that excellent fairenesse she atteineth not, while she warfareth on the earth. The militant Church therefore is not fully cleane from spot of all errours. Shée shall be 
                  Eph. 5.2.7. 
               a Church not hauing spot or wrincle when shée shall be glorious: as Paul declareth to the Ephesians. Wherefore sith to promise that gloriousnesse in this life, is, to sound the triumph before the conquest be gotten: it foloweth that the Church shall haue spot and wrincle so long as she doth liue in warfare. But, ouer and besides all this, because the Church, while it is in warfare, hath vnfaithfull souldiours in it amongst the faithfull, who as they are vnlike either to other, so is their case vnlike too: therefore as the men that are in the Church, so the kindes of errours must be discerned and distinguished, that it may the better appéere to what errours what part of the Church is subiect. To erre then is to swarue and turne out of the way, which God by the word of life (the holy scripture) hath willed vs to walke in. Which way sith it containeth soundnes of doctrine, and godlines of maners, as I haue shewed before: therevpon it foloweth that they who offend, either in maners, or in doctrine, doo erre and go out of the way. Wée erre in maners therefore, when we doo ill: we erre in doctrine, when we iudge falsely. Now these errours of the minde are of like condition in comparison of life eternall, as are diseases of the body in comparison of life temporall. So that as amongst diseases of the body some are curable, some are deadly; curable I call them whereof we recouer, deadly, whereof we dye: in like sort amongst the errours of the minde some are curable, which doo not bereue vs of saluation; some deadly, which bring vs to euerlasting death. In the Church militant they whom God hath chosen may erre in maners

and doctrine: but their errour is curable, they can not erre to death. But they who are called onely, and not chosen, may erre in maners and doctrine, euen with a deadly errour, which neuer shall be cured. That the chosen may erre in maners and doctrine: it is euident by the Apostles. For they did erre in maners, when 
                  Matt. 26.56. 
               they forsooke Christ, at the time that Iudas the renegate betrayed him. They did erre in doctrine, when 
                  Act. 1.6. 
               they thought the kingdome of Christ to be not heauenly, but earthly: not spirituall, but like the kingdomes of this world; presently to come, not after to be looked for: proper to Israel, not common to all nations by vertue of the promises. Yea, that more is, when they had receiued the holy Ghost in greater measure from heauen, 
                  Gal. 2.14. 
               Peter went not rightly to the truth of the Gospell: 
               
                  Reu. 19.10. & 22.8. 
               Iohn would haue worshipped an Angell once or twise: 
                  Act. 11.2. 
               the Apostles & brethren who were in Iudaea thought that the word of God was not to be preached to the Gentiles. But yet al these errours of the Apostles were curable. For both they returned to Christ when he was risen againe from death to life: and first them selues acknowledged, then they taught others the state of his kingdome: and Peter being reproued by Paul, did yeeld vnto him: and Iohn stayed himselfe vpon the Angels admonition, and the Apostles with the brethren being taught the truth, were glad yt God had graunted to the Gentiles also repentance vnto life. Wherein that is performed which was promised by Christ, when Peter hauing made that worthy profession of faith, he said vnto him: 
                  Mat. 16.18. 
               Thou art Peter, and on this stone will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it. The gates of hell

Perhaps they build stubble: but they build on the foundation. And the foundation is Christ Iesus, from whom they shall neuer be plucked away. For, as Fabius saith in 
                  Liu. lib. 22. 
               Liuie, that right doth faint often, as being not able well to proue the truth, but it neuer dyeth: so men, who cleaue to right and truth, are oft assaulted, but they are neuer conquered. The 
                  Luk. 15.4. 
               sheepe of Christ may go astray in the wildernes: but 
                  Ioh. 10.28. they can not perish. The

               faith of Peter him selfe did sowne, as you would say: but it failed not. Hée was turned away a while from the Lord, whom he denied too: but he was turned againe vnto him. To conclude, the faithfull are sorely pressed often, by many enemies, and mightie: but they shall neuer be suppressed.

It is certaine therefore that the elect and chosen, though they be made the children of God by adoption, yet are subiect to errour. Howbeit, of the other side, they are subiect so, that they are freed from the gilt of errour by Christ, and are accepted as holy of God, because they are in part holy.

We receiue therefore the gifts of the holy Ghost, according to the simple capacitie of mans weakenesse, not to the maiestie of Gods spirit.

               tell the Church,) can not. Which is false and fond. For, as there are sheepe and goates in the flockes: so the Pastours of them are good, hirelinges, or theeues. The good ones do slumber sometimes, as the Apostles: the 
                  Ioh. 10. ver. 12. 
               hirelinges fly assoone as the woolfe commeth: the 
                  ver. 10. 
               theeues come to steale, to kill and to destroy. Wherefore no Pastour is exempt from danger of erring more or lesse. And, for the former point that they may erre in maners, what néede I bring Apostles or Prophets to proue it? The complaint of Bernard is fresh, I would to God it were not too fresh:

& Pastours of the Church, doo shew, that not a common disease, but a rot; and that not small, but ougly; and that creeping on, not kéeping at a stay; may infect, not onely this or that member, but the whole body of Pastors for their maners.

But the Papistes will reply, that when they say the Church cānot erre, they meane the Church in that sense in which the Schoole-men call it representatiue, that is, Bishops and Prelates representing the whole church in a generall Councell. What? And hath that Church (I meane, a generall Councell) this priuilege that it can not erre? They hold so in deede. But what will they say of so many Councels of the Arians? which caused

               re against Pope Eugenius. Upon the which pointes it must needes be graunted that one side of these generall Councels did erre: vnlesse we will say that thinges which are contrarie may be true both. Wherefore, to make an end, sith it is apparant by most cléere proofes, that both the chosen and the called, both the flockes, and the Pastours, both in seuerall by them selues and assembled together in generall Councels, may erre: I am to conclude, with the good liking (I hope) of such as loue the truth, that the militant Church may erre in maners and doctrine. In the one point whereof, concerning maners, I defend our selues against ye malicious sclanders of the

                  The third conclusiō.
               Whose intolerable presumption is reproued by the third Conclusion too: wherein it resteth to be shewed, that the holy scripture is of greater credit & autoritie then the Church. And although this be so manifestly true, that to haue proposed it onely, is, to haue proued it: yet giue me leaue I pray to proue it briefly with one reason, I will not trouble you with many. All the wordes of scripture be the wordes of truth: some wordes of the Church be the words of errour. But he that telleth the truth alwayes, is more to be credited, then he that lyeth sometimes. Therefore the holy scripture is to be credited more, then is the Church. That all the wordes of scripture be the wordes of truth: it is out of controuersie. For 2. Tim. 3.16. 
               the whole scripture is inspired of God: and 
                  Tit. 1.2. 
               God can neither deceiue nor be deceiued. That some wordes of the Church be the wordes of errour: if any be not perswaded perhaps by the reasons which I haue brought already, let him heare the sharpese and most earnest Patrone of the Church confessing it.

For if some cauiller (to shift of this reason) shall say that we must not account of that errour as though it were the iudgement of the generall Councell, because the Bishop of Rome did not allow it and approue it: I would request him, first of all, to weigh, that a generall Councell and assemblie of Bishops must néedes be distinguished from this and that particular Bishop; so that, what the greater part of them ordeineth, that is ordeined by the Councell: next, to consider, that the name of Church may be giuen to an assemblis of Bishops and a Councell, but it can not be giuen to the Bishop of Rome: lastly, to remember, that the Bishop of Rome, Honorius the first, was condemned of heresie by

Now if the Bishop of Rome and Romanistes them selues be forced to confesse, both that the Church saith some things which are erroneous, and that the scripture saith nothing but cleere truth: shall there yet be found any man, either so blockishly vnskilfull, or so frowardly past shame, as that he dare affirme that the Church is of greater credit and autoritie then the holy scripture?

               Plinie reporteth that there was at Rome a certaine diall set in the field of Flora to note the shadowes of the sunne: the notes and markes of which diall had not agreed with the sunne for the space of thirty yeares. And the cause thereof was this, as Plinie saith, that either the course of the sunne was disordered and changed by some meanes of heauen, or els the whole earth was slipt away from her centre. The Church of Rome séemeth to be very like this diall in the field of Flora. For she was placed in the Roman territorie to shew the shadowes of the sunne, euen of 
                  Mal. 4.2. 
               the sunne of righteousnes, that is, of Christ: but her notes and markes haue not agreed with Christ these many yeares togither. Not that there is any faute in the diall, I meane in the Church, (for that can not be, as Pighius proueth pretily:) but because perhaps either Christ him selfe hath tooke an other course, and is altered I know not by what changeablenes of God, or els the whole scripture is slipt from the point in the which it stood. But let vs (right woorshipfull) who know that the dials and clockes doo mysse often, but the course of the sunne is certaine and constant, let vs make more account of the sunne, then of a diall; of heauen, then of Plinie; of the Zodiake circle, then of the field of Flora; of God, then of men; of Christ, then of Pighius; of the holy scripture, then of the church. For God forbid there should be any (amongst vs) so beastly a monster in the shape of man, as to set vp Antichrist in the temple of God aboue God: and to attribute more to any, either man, or multitude of men, then to the Lord of maiestie. But so doo they, no dout, who haue the Church in greater regard then the scripture. For the voice of the scripture is the voice of God: the voice of the Church is the voice of men. Then if it be impious to set vp men aboue God: doubtlesse, to set vp the Church aboue the scripture, it is Antichristian. Nor yet doo I deny that the Churches voice is sometimes the voice of God. For, in appeasing the offenses

and reprouing the sinnes of brethren, 
                  Mat. 18.17.
               if thy brother (saith Christ) refuse to heare the church, let him be to thee as a heathen man, and a Publican. But the holy spirit, that is the spirit of truth, doth speake, both alone, and alwaies, in the scripture. An humaine spirit, that is a spirit of errour, hath a part sometimes in the spéech of the Church. Both which pointes I haue proued by the word of God, the euidence of the thing, and the confessions of our aduersaries. Why doo we not then acknowledge that the royall prerogatiue of this priuilege, to bee altogither exempt from all errour, is due to scripture onely; and confesse, as 
                  De bapt. conc. Donatist. lib. 2. c. 3. 
               Austin doth against the Donatistes, that it is peculiar and proper to the holy canonicall scripture, that all things which are writen therein be true, and right: but the letters and writings of Bishops, as of Cyprian, yea the very Councels, not prouinciall onely, but also full and generall, haue often times somewhat that may be amended. I, for my part, doo gladly both allow this sentence of Austin, and iudge it woorthy to be allowed, as agréeable to the trueth. And therefore I conclude the point which I proposed, that the holy scripture is of greater credit and autoritie then the church. Thus you haue my iudgement (right learned Inceptors) touching the Conclusions which are to be disputed of; opened in more wordes perhaps, then your wisedome; in fewer, then the weight of the things required. But I haue waded so farre in the opening of them, as I thought the Proctors might wel giue me leaue by the straitnes of time. As for that which néedeth to be discussed farther: I will assay to open it, as well as I can (if occasion serue,) when the aduersarie arguments shall bée proposed in disputation.

               1 The holy Catholike Church, which we beleeue, is the whole company of Gods elect and chosen.

               Where on the south the mightie prince of Abissines doth raigne;
               Where on the north the coasts do lye that looke to Charles waine;
               Where Phaebus with his glistring beames doth raise the dawning light,
               And sinking in the westerne seas doth bring the darksome night.

               2 The Church of Rome is not the Catholike Church, nor a sound member of the catholike Church.
               THey do not well who shut the world within the Roman boundes:
               Christs Church is spred through al ye earth without restraint of mounds▪
               
               
                  Rome was (I grant) a faithfull branch of this renowned vine:
               
                  Rome was a myrrour that in grace, in zeale, in loue, did shine:
               
                  Rome was commended farre and wide for faith in Christ his name:
               For Peters doctrine taught and kept Rome was of worthy fame.
               But where Rome was, now ruines are. The Capitoll is s

               Whom lustfull traines, and wicked hearts, and beds vnchast defile.
               O thrise vnhappie Babylon, that Sions spoyle doost woorke,

               3 The reformed churches in England, Scotland, France, Germany, and other kingdomes & common wealthes haue seuered them selues lawfully from the church of Rome.
               A Place of haunt for deuils and sprits is Babylon waxt, saith Iohn.
               Art thou desirous to be saued?  from Babylon be gon.
               The names and trickes of Babylon Rome on it selfe doth take.
               Then, if ye séeke eternall life, sée that ye Rome forsake.
               This haue the noble Germanes done bidding the Pope a dieu:
               
                  England hath followed Germany, Romes thraldome to eschew.
               Beholde the Lord hath called on the Flemish, French, and Dane:
               
               And Scotland hath escaped eke the Papall deadly bane.
               O that the remnant of the world by faith to Christ were knit,
               And Princes to the Prince of all their scepters would submit.
               Build vp O Lord, O father deare, the church and Sions fort:
               That vnto thée from Babylon thy people may resort.
            
         
         
            
            
               AMongst many singular benefits of God bestowed vpon our Vniuersitie, (fathers, and brethren,) which may be very fruitfull to the aduancing of Gods glory and saluation of the Church, if they be well husbanded: there is scarse any more excellent (in my iudgement,) then that it is ordered, that the truth giuen by inspiration of God, and registred in the Scripture, should be not expounded onely by publike lectures, but also proued by disputations. A woorthy and profitable ordinance, no doubt: and most méete for schooles which serue to traine vp Christians, that is, for schooles of God. For what can there be more pretious then the truth, which teacheth vs the knowledge of God, the way to life?

For as golde, being digged out of the veines of the earth, is seuered from earthy substance (mixt therewith) by the mettall-workemen knocking it together; and as husbandmen are wont to sift wheat from the chaffe by winowing, that it may be fit to nourish the body: so the golden treasure of truth by striking reasons as it were together is parted from the dregs, which it hath not gotten frō the holy veines whence it is digged, but from mens vessels wherein it is receiued; and the corne that is sowen for the foode of the soule, is winowed (with the winde that bloweth from the holy Ghost) by the husbandmen of heauen, that it may be cleaner from the chaffe of errours. The chéerefull vndertaking, and faithfull performing of the which duetie the common wealth may chalenge at our hands of right: specially for that it hath indowed and furnished this noble Vniuersitie and place of exercise of good learning with priuileges, with houses, with lands in ample sort, to this intent chiefly that it might be a nurserie for Pastours of the Church. For both it is méete that Pastours of the Church should be not onely able to edifie the faithfull with sound and wholesome doctrine, but also

                a Roman Bishop did write long ago to the Bishops of Iewry: Ye thinke your selues to deale for the faith (O ye Romans) & ye go against the faith; ye do arme your selues with the name of the church, & ye fight against the church. Wherfore, being perswaded that ye handling hereof would auaile much to ease the ignorance of the

vnskilfull, and quaile the stubbornnesse of our aduersaries, and furder (which is the chiefe point) the saluation of the elect: I, for the duety, or rather more then duty which I owe to the church of Christ, resolued with my selfe (hauing such opportunitie of disputation offered) to treate of the state of the Catholike, of the Roman, and of our owne Church. The rather, for that the foundations of this woorke are already layed in our former disputation: wherein it was shewed out of the word of truth, that the scripture teacheth all things needefull to saluation; that the church may erre while it is militant on the earth; that the autoritie of the church is subiect to the scripture. Which things being setled, it will be the easier to build thereupon that which I haue purposed: I meane, to lay open the nature and condition of the catholike church, the corruption of the Roman, and the soundnes of ours. But before I enter into the opening of these pointes, which I will doo (by Gods grace) briefly, as the time; sincerely, as the charge requireth: first I must desire and craue of you all, my hearers, most earnestly, not that you will giue mée an attentiue eare, which of your owne accord ye doo: but that with your eare you will bring a minde desirous to embrace the truth.

And hereof I say, the holy catholike church is the whole company of Gods elect and chosen. Which is termed a Church, that is, a company ofmen and an assembly of people called togither; holy, because God hath chosen this company, and sanctified it to him selfe; Catholike, for that it consisteth not of one nation, but of all, spred through the whole world. For God, to the entent that he might impart the riches of his glorious grace vnto mankinde,

               I will be your God, and ye shall be my people. What is the tenour, how greate the vse, how vnspeakable the benefit of this holy couenant, made with the Patriarkes, the Prophets, the Apostles, and all the Saintes of God: it is recorded in the sacred instruments of the olde and new testament, or couenant. An abridgement whereof, containing the summeof the Apostles doctrine, is deliuered in ye articles of our Christian faith, or Creede, as we terme it, gathered out of Gods worde. Wherefore as the couenant consisteth of two branches: so the Creede expressing it conteineth two partes. One of them instructeth our faith touching God, who saide to his seruants, I will be your God: the other, touching the people of God, that is the Church, to whom God saide, you shall be my people. Touching God, it teacheth vs to beleeue in him, who is one God in nature,

distinct in three persons; the Father the creator, the Sonne the redéemer, the holy Ghost the sanctifier. Touching the people of God, it teacheth vs to beleeue, that they are a Church, holy, and Catholike, which hath communion of the Saints, to whom their sinnes are forgiuen, whose bodies shalbe raised vp againe from death, and being ioyned with their soules shall liue euerlastingly. Now, to make the matter more euident and plaine that this citie of God and company of the chosen is the holy Catholike Church: first, it is certaine that the people of God is called effectually out of the filth of other men, to know, and serue him, by Christ who doth lighten their mindes, and moue their hartes, through the power of the holy Ghost and ministerie of the word. And the whole company of them, who are so called, is named the Church, by an excellencie; not a common one, but a passing, eminent, and most noble Church: as wherein the faithfull all are comprehended that eyther be, or haue béene, or shal be to the end from the beginning ofthe world. Which is termed in 
                  Heb. 12.23. scripture the Church of the first borne, who are writen in heauen. Which 
                  Ephes. 1 5. 
               God did predestinate to be adopted in him self, according to the good pleasure of his wil. Which

               Christ being giuen to it by his Father, as a head to the body, loued as his spouse, redeemed it from Satan, and quickneth it with his Spirit, hauing suffered death him selfe to deliuer vs from the gulfe of death. Moreouer as it is cleere that this Church is called out of the rascall sort of the world, to be partaker of the inheritance of the kingdom of heauen: so is it cléere too that it ought to be holy.

is holy in affection, triumphant in heauen is holier in perfection, both militant and triumphant is in Christ most holy. Finally, sith God hath called the holy church not out of this or that countrey, not out of this or that people, but out of all nations spred through the whole world: for that cause the church is intitled Catholike, that is, vniuersall: not Iewish, not Roman, not English, not of one people or prouince, but vniuersall and Catholike, cōpacted as it were into one body out of all sorts of estates, sexes, ages, & nations; Iewes, & Heathens; Greeks, & Barbarians; bond, and free; men, and wemen; old, and young; rich, and poore.

For they wrest the holy catholike Church (taught vs in the Creede) from the right meaning, to the intent they may be kings, & hoyse vp the sayles of their owne ambition: in as much as they apply it, like vnskilfull men, if they doo it ignorantly; impious, if wittingly; they apply it (I say) not to the Catholike Church, but to ye 
               militant; nor to that, as it is chosē, but as it is visible, mingled with hypocrites and vngodly persons. The cause, why they do so, is, that all Christians, by reason they beleeue the holy Catholike Church, may be induced to thinke that the visible Church must be held for Catholike, and a visible monarchie must be in the visible Church, and the Pope is Prince of the visible monarchie, and all Christians must be subiect to him as Prince.

               Boniface the eighth, beginning with these wordes, One holy Catholike Church. Where from one Catholike Church, without the which there is no saluatiō, nor forgiuenes of sinnes, he créepeth vp to the head of the Church euē Iesus Christ, & from Christ the head he slippeth downe by stealth vnto Christs vicar, one and the same head (as he saith) with Christ, euen the Pope of Rome: whom yet to be the head of

the Catholike Church not him selfe would say, (vnlesse perhaps in a dreame,) for thē he shuld be head of the triumphant church, which is a part of the Catholike: but he would be head of the visible church, which he nameth Catholike, therby the more easily to deceiue the simple: who being astonied and snared with that name, the fowler shutteth vp the net, and concludeth, that euery earthly creature if he will be saued must of necessitie be subiect to the Pope. Thus saith Pope Boniface. But vnlesse the Pope him selfe and the Fathers of his Councell of Trent, being thereto forced by the truth of scripture, confesse against them selues, that the holy Catholike Church doth not signify the visible company of the Church militant, cōsisting of the good and badde mixt together; which sense the Papists giue it with their Pope Boniface to the intent they may be kings: I will not request you to beleue me in it. For, in the Catechisme which was set foorth by Pope Pius the fifth according to the decree of the Councell of Trent,

                hauing said that the Church (in the Creed) doth chiefly signifie the company of the good & bad togither, they adde, that Christ is head of the Church as of his body, so that, as bodily members haue life from the soule, in like sort the faithfull haue from Christs spirit: and therefore it is holy because it hath receiued the grace of holines and forgiuenes of sinnes from Christ, who sanctifieth & washeth it with his blood: and it is called Catholike, because it is spred in the light of one faith from the east to the west, receiuing men of all sortes, be they Scythians or Barbarians, bond or free, male or female; conteining all the faithfull which haue bene from Adam euen till this day, or shall be hereafter till the ende of the world, pro
                     •
                  essing the true faith, & being built vpon Christ, vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. Pope Pius therefore and the Fathers of the Councell of Trent affirme that the Church, which is specified in the Creede, is the body of Christ. Now, the scripture teacheth that 
                  Eph. 4.
                     •
                  6. 
               all the body of Christ is quickned and increased by the holy Ghost, as if he were the soule of it. But the bad and wicked are neither quickned, nor increased. Then are they no part of the body of Christ: and therfore neither of the Church. Pope Pius and the Fathers of the Councel of Trent affirme that the Church is holy, being washed by the blood of Christ, indued with grace of holines, and with forgiuenes of sinnes.
               
Now, 
                  Rom. 4.7. 
               blessed are they whose sinnes are forgiuen: 
               
                  Matt. 5.8. 
               blessed are the cleane in heart, for they shall see God. But the bad and wicked shall neither see God, nor are blessed. Therefore neither haue they forgiuenes of sinnes, nor are their harts cleane. Then are they no part of the church. Pope Pius and the Fathers of the Councell of Trent affirme that the church is called Catholike, in respect that it conteineth all the faithfull from the first to the last, professing the true faith, and being built vpon Christ. But the wicked and hypocrites either are not faithfull; or, if they may be called so, yet they professe not the true faith; or, if they professe it, yet they are not built on Christ. For they who are built on Christ, are 
                  Mat. 7. ver. 24. 
               built on a rocke, 
               
                  ver. 25. and shall neuer be remoued. But the wicked shall be remoued. Then are they no part of the church. Yet they must néedes be a part of the church if the name of church did signifie the visible church (as we call it) consisting of the good and bad. Wherfore it foloweth thereof that the church mentioned in ye Créede, betokeneth not the visible church, that is, the company of good and bad together: which it is imagined to do by the builders of the Popes monarchie. Thus, as Caiaphas in the Gospel although he spake many things amisse against Christ, yet, 
                  Ioh. 11. ver. 49 
               being the high Priest that same yeere, he saide well in this spéech, though ill meant too, 
                  ver. 50. that it was expedient for them that one man should dye for the people: so the Pope and the Fathers of the Councell of Trent, being the high Priestes that same yere, though they meant yll, in saying that the holy catholike church, which we beléeue, is the company of good and bad mixt together: yet, being lead and moued by some diuine force to speake better then they meant, they added such an exposition, that their owne doctrine is ouerthrowen by it, the errour of the Councell of Constance is discouered, and the truth of the scripture confirmed and established. Wherefore I may iustly conclude against the Papists out of the Pope him selfe and the Councell of Trent, that all the good and holy men, and none but they, do make the holy Catholike church. But séeing our faith must haue a better ground then humane decrées either of Popes or Councels, whose breath is in their nosethrils, whose houses are of clay, and their foundation is sande: therefore let vs stay our selues on that conclusion which I made before on warrant of the holy Ghost, who hath spoken to vs by the Apostles

and Prophets; The holy Catholik Church, which we beleeue, is the whole company of Gods elect and chosen. And let this suffice for the first Conclusion.
            
            The second doth folow:
                  The fifth cōclusion.
                
               The church of Rome is not the catholike church, nor a sound mēber of the catholike church. Of the which position that we may the better perceiue the drift and truth: we must search somewhat déeper, and fetch the beginnings of particular churches out of the fountaine whence they flowe. God, hauing chosen in his eternall purpose the holy catholike church, that is, all his children, to be the heires of his kingdome, and to triumph in heauenly glory with him and his elect Angels: doth first of all sende them abroade into the earth, as it were into a campe, there to serue him in warre against the flesh, the world, the deuill, and all the powers of darkenes vnder the banner of Christ, that they may come conquerours out of warfare to the triumph, and may striue lawfully before they be crowned. Whereto that they may be the stronger made and better furnished, to endure the labour and hardnes of warfare: God 1. Pet. 1.23. 
               begetteth them a new by his word, (the word working effectually through the holy Ghost,) as it were by seede; and 1. Cor. 3.2. with the same word he nourisheth them, as with milke; 
                  Heb. 5.14. strengtheneth them, as with meat; armeth them, 
                  Eph. 6. ver. 17. as with a sword of the Spirit; and frameth them 
                  ver. 16. 
               a shield of faith, wherewith they may quench the firie dartes of the wicked one. Yea, the more to harten them against all dangers and deceites of enemies with the skill of warfare and sure hope of victorie: he bindeth them with sacraments, as with bonds of obedience, and pledges of his grace; he willeth them to

               call for his helpe in distresses, & promiseth it if they call for it, he appointeth them warlike discipline, to kéepe them selues in order, and gard them safer from their enemies: to be short, be deliuereth them the whole trade of warfare, opened by himselfe the Generall of the armie, and writen in his word. To the intent then, that all the souldiers of God, who be sent at diuers times into diuers countries to serue him in this warfare, might learne it, & practise it: he hath ordeined, as ciuill assemblies & societies, for ye mainteinance of this life; so likewise, for the next, ecclesiasticall. In which ecclesiasticall societies and assemblies it is his will & pleasure that there should be captaines to teach, and souldiers to learne, both of them warriours faithfully

to practise and wage the warre of the Lord. And these are called churches, but particular churches to distinguish them from the catholike: because they are diuers partes of the catholike, that is, the whole church; diuers members, of one body, diuers bandes, of one army. Which, for the diuers regard of place, and time, wherein they go to warfare, are specified by diuers names. In regard of place: the church, which serued God at Ierusalem, is called the church of Ierusalem: that which at Samaria, the church of Samaria: that which at Ephesus, the church of Ephesus; that which at Rome, the church of Rome; they which in England, in France, in Germany, are called the English, the French, the Dutch churches. In regard of time: wée say the Iewish church in the dayes of Moses, of Dauid, of Ezekias; the Roman vnder Nero, Constantine, Boniface; the English in King Henries raigne, King Edwardes, Queene Maries: or how soeuer els the difference of times be noted. Now, the rule of reason and honestie would that euery one of these churches, ordeined by God to that end, should bring foorth the children of God, as a mother; yeld dutifull honour to God, as a spouse; and fight the spirituall battailes of God, as a valiant and faithfull army.

And him selfe prouoketh the faithfull to reuolt from God, by all his practises, open, and secret; force, and fraude: some time by fyer and sword of tyrantes, some time by baites of pleasures, and wealth, some time by the pretense of religion, and charitie. By the which meanes he procureth often, partly through the craft and cunning of hypocrites, chiefly when they are made captaines of some band, partly through the frailtie and infirmitie of the elect, whom flesh and blood doo weaken: that the church, which is billed to the warfare of Christ, knoweth not or careth not for the trade of warfare, and serueth perhaps vnder her captaines banner, but retchlessely, and loosely, perhaps is betrayed to the enemy by her watchmen, while either

they doo fall a sleepe, or deale falsely. And so commeth that to passe at the length, which

Furthermore, to make it easier to be séene what churches ought to be accounted dead, what churches sicke, what churches whole, and sound: we haue to consider the causes of death, of sicknesse, and of health. The causes of these things do come in mens bodies, (as

Thus I haue declared, as briefly as I could, how particular churches are called members of the catholike: how they are ordeyned to learn and practise Go

Which pointes being marked, my paines wil be the lesser in opening the Conclusion: the two stemmes whereof on what rootes they grow you perceiue already. The church of Rome is not the catholike church: it is no sound member of the catholike church. The church of Rome is not the catholike church. What can be more cléere? For the catholike church is the church vniuersall: the church of Rome is particular. So that (in my iudgement) the Papistes speake monstrously, when As Bristow Moriu. 12. with this speciall note in the m

                we iudge of the churches of Germanie, which are troubled with the errour of consubstantiation as it were with the grudging of a litle ague, if other wise they holde Christian faith, and loue, soundly, and sincerely. But the church of Rome is not distempered with a litle ague, such as hindereth not the functions of life greatly: but is sicke of a canker, or rather of a leprosy, or rather of a pestilence, in so much that she is past hope of recouery, vnlesse our Sauiour Christ the heauenly physician doo giue her wholesome medicins to purge her of pernicious humours. And therefore I pronounce that the church of Rome is no sound member of the catholike church. Which I will proue by two reasons, the one, of the causes; the other, of the effectes: whereof from the one, diseases doo arise; in the other, they shew them selues; by them both they are surely proued. I would to God I might discourse hereof at large, according as the

weightines of the thinges requireth. But we must be content to doo, as time wil license vs. You wil pardon me therefore, I trust, if I runne them ouer somewhat hastily, and (as they say) touch and go. I will hold out my finger toward the well head: gesse you the lion by his pawes. Concerning the causes which doo bréed diseases and sicknesse in the church, it is (as I haue touched already) cléere and certaine, that they are either the want of food of Gods word, or the hauing of it corrupted. In the which respect, Christ, who giueth charge that 
                  Ioh. 21.16. 
               his sheepe be fedde, chargeth that 
                  Matt. 28.20. 
               they be taught to obserue those thinges which he commanded his Apostles. And Peter, hauing shewed that 1. Pet. 1.23. 
               the faithfull are begotten a new by Gods word, exhorteth them to 1. Pet. 2.2. 
               desire the milke of the word, the sincere milke, &

But the church of Rome doth bring in both corruption, and want of the worde: nor onely bring them in, but also maintaine them obstinatly, as wholesome. The church of Rome therefore is not whole and sound: nay she séemeth rather to be madde & frantike. For she bringeth in corruption of the worde, (to beginne with that,) by mingling and adulterating the word of God with mans word, not one way but sundrie. First, in that she giueth

The church of Rome therefore hath brought in such corruption of the word of God, what by the apocrypha, what by traditions, what by faultes of the translation, what by the sense of her holding, what by commandements of the church, what by the teachers of idiotes: that she séemeth to haue mingled the sustenance of life not with filth, but with poyson; and the wine of God not with water, but with venoome; and the bread of Christ not with leauen, but with ratsbane, or rather (if I might speake so) mens-bane. As for want of Gods word, (which is the other cause of sicknesse) how wretchedly she hath pined her children therewith: our auncestours felt by long experience, and aged men may remember, and histories of the church doo witnesse, and they who are vnder the Popish yoke know. For though she permitted, sometimes, in some places, perhaps, a small parcell, of the word of God, (if I may call that Gods word which sauoured more of mens deuises then of God) to be touched, in the presence and assembly of the people, by common cryers, preachers, such as they were: yet she hath not onely not permitted to Christians, but also hath hindered, with no lesse impietie then inhumanitie, yea, and hindereth still that abundance and plentie which they ought to haue, as it is writen,

               Hosius saith), if the holy scriptures be read in

mother toongs, doo kéepe them sealed vp in a straunge toong, and sound them out so in their Church-assemblies, that the people may haue eyes, and not reade them; eares, and not heare them. In the which fact whither they shew them selues more disobedient to God, or iniurious to the people; it is hard to say: sith God hath expresly commanded that 1 Cor. 14.26. 
               all things must be doon to edifie, that is, to build vp; and things not vnderstoode (I trow) build not vp, 
                  Gen. 11.7. no not the tower of Babylon. But by this meanes the people can not heare the word of God publikely, because he speaketh to them in an outlandish toong, and a strange language. Which thing 
                  Esai. 28.11. the Lord laid on the Iewes for a punishment: the Roman Church doth thrust it on Christians for a benefit. Much lesse are they able priuately to reade it: because they neither haue the scriptures translated into their mother toongs; and many (in the time of our predecessours) were condemned as heretikes, for reading part thereof which they had translated. Wherefore sith the plentie of the word of God, which it is a point of very heinous wickednes not to procure for Christians, more heinous not to allow it them, most heinous not to permit it them, is not onely not permitted but hindered by the Church of Rome, and hindered not onely by lawes but by fyer too: I will not vse sharper wordes against her tyranny; onely this I say, that he must be impudent néedes who would deny that shée hath brought in a famin of the word. The causes then of sicknesse, are manifestly found in the Church of Rome, both for the corruption and scarcitie of the foode of life. Now, such as the cause is, such is the effect: and out of bitter fountaines there issue bitter waters. The lesse maruell is it that her effectes and functions bewray sore diseases, such as must of likelihood procéede from such causes. For a sound and whole Church, the faculties and powers whereof are not impaired, hath fower speciall functions, as Chiefly the Actes of the Apostles, and the epistles to the Corinthians, & Timothee.

And hence arose that saying, which is common and famous amongst our countriemen, (he meaneth the Frenchmen:) Things haue gone ill with men, 
               In Latin it is, ex quo decretis alae aecesserunt: that is, word forword▪ 
                  since winge; were added to decrees. But to expresse in English the allusion which the Latin saying hath (in decretis and alae) to decretales: I haue chaunged the word. Yet keeping iust the sense. For those winges are tales, deuises of ambitious Popes, and foolish fansies of their Parasites. 
               since tales were added to Decrees, that is, since ye time that in steed of ye 
               Decrees the Decretales did beare sway. For the Church-causes had lost their olde simplicitie, when Decrees were patched out with those tales: as the world is wont to growe worse and worse, So destenies do prouide That all thinges fall vnto decay, and backe efisoones they slide. As for the other volume, the sixth booke of Decretales, which Bo

No not the Clementines neither, nor Extrauagants, the last part of the Decretales, are voyde of like faultes: nay, the later lawes of the Popes be commonly worse then the former. And this is the body of the Canon-law, these are the Popes statutes, by the which, though very vnméete for the church (in Duarens iudgement) yet is the church of Rome gouerned: and it is so gouerned, that

               The Court of Rome with poyson strōg infected to destroy, With the contagion of her sores dooth countries all anoy. Wherfore to knitte vp the summe of my reason, séeing it is manifest by the very euidence of the things themselues, that nether the faith of Christ is taught purely, nor the sacraments rightly ministred, nor prayers made religiously, nor discipline duely practised in ye 
               Church of Rome: if the former reason of causes séeme too weake, yet is it fully proued (I hope) by the effects, that the Church of Rome is no sound member of the Catholike church. How much more absurde were it to count her the Catholike Church. The Church of Rome therefore is neither the Catholike, nor a sound member of the Catholike Church.
            
            I haue stayed longer in opening this Conclusion,
               
                  The sixth Conclusiō.
                then I had purposed: but I may runne ouer the last so much the more speedily. For knowing how the Church of Rome is infected with pestilent diseases, the contagion whereof, as 
                  Leu. 13. ver. 44. the lepers sore, because it is daungerous to them who dwell neere it, must therefore 
                  ver. 46. be remoued out of the campe of the faithfull: we may be assured that the reformed Churches in England, Scotland, Fraunce, Germanie, and other kingdomes & common weales, haue seuered themselues lawfully from the Church of Rome. For that is done lawfully which is done by the warrant of the word of God:

Therefore they seuered themselues from the Church of Rome lawfully. For as ecclesiasticall societies and Church-assemblies were ordained by God, that 1. Chron. 1

               IT is now fiue yeares almost, (gentle reader) since being occasioned by order of our Vniuersitie to handle and defend these Conclusions in disputation: I was moued to make them cō
               mon vnto many, that through the instruction and consolation of the scripture the church might reape some fruite of them. Howbeit as Apelles was wont to set forth his pictures at his stall, that, if any fault were found, he might amend it, before they were deliuered to such as they were drawen for: the like haue I done with mine, (though not like his,) by keping thē in Latin at home as it were, that, if any thing were iustly blamed in them, it might be corrected, before I sent them abroad to English men. In the which respect, though I could hardly resist the importunate desire of sundry frendes, of whom some had translated them, requesting that I would translate them my selfe or suffer theirs to be printed: yet I resisted it, & hope they tooke it in good part. But now being otherwise enforced to publish my conference with M. Hart: I haue cō
               descended vnto their request, to do them into English, & publish them withall. The rather, because I haue proued herein, that the faith professed by the Church of Rome is not the Catholike faith. The contrary whereof was the last point that M. Hart auouched. So that, seeing he brake off conference thereon, and would not put the faith of his church to that triall, to which he had put the Pope, the head of it: the godly, who will wish that also had bene handled to the confusion of all Poperie, may for want of larger repast take this sclenderer,

as better halfe a loafe (men say) then no bread. And I am the bolder to set it before them: because Doctor Stapleton & Licentiate Martin, who, as euill physicians to get themselues worke, doo praise vnholesome baggage aboue holesome foode, haue discōmended it. Chiefly, sith their dealing therein hath bene such, that they haue shewed greater stomake thē wisedome, as physicians of no value. For of foure pointes that I find reproued by the former of them, in Thom. Stapleton. princip. fidei doctrin. excus. Paris. 1582. the last editiō of his doctrinall principles: one is, Lib. 1. cap. 6. that I distinguish the militant and visible church from the Catholike, after a new sort, vnskilfully, and fondly. The distinction therof In the second, fourth, and fifth Conclusions. I grounded on the scripture: 1. Cor. 2.1

               new (it may be) to others, not to vs. But the Doctor saw that Babylon would fall if the distinction stoode. Wherefore if he had no stronger shot then this to discharge against it: I will beare with him; as in the rest of his tauntes also. Loosers must haue their wordes. An other point In the fourth Conclusion. he carpeth at, is mine exposition of holy catholike church. Which I hauing proued by the Papistes themselues, that it must needes signifie the company of the chosen alone, not mixt with wicked ones, because (by their 
               Catechism. Council. Trident. in exposit. Symboli.

               all the body of Christ is quickned by his spirit, which the wicked are not: he Stapleton. princ. doctrin. lib. 1. cap. 11. replieth that the church is said in the scripture to be the body of Christ quickned by his spirite, because some partes of it are so, not all the body. An aunswere somewhat straunge: considering that the scripture, which I had alleaged, saith that

For touching that he addeth that he hath disproued it, by shewing that the church is distinguished from hereticall assemblies by the name of Catholike: he hath disproued it as soundly therby, as if he should say, that the Epistola catholica Iacobi & Petri. 
               Catholike epistles in the new Testament, were not so called, as generall, & writen to no certaine persons, because that other writings are named catholike also to distinguish them from hereticall. The third point he taketh vpon him to confute, is an argument that I made to proue my third Conclusion. Staplet princ▪ doctrin. lib. 12▪ cap. 16. 
               All the wordes of scripture be the wordes of trueth: some wordes of the Church be the wordes of errour. But he that telleth the trueth alwayes, is more to be credited, thē he that lyeth sometimes. Therefore the holy scripture is to be credited more thē is the Church. And to this argumēt (saith he) I answere briefly, that no words of the Church are the words of error, that is, that no erroneus thing is euer taught, defined, or approued, by the Church in her Bishops & Pastors teaching vniformly; in the decrees of Councels, chiefly of generall Councels; in that which the Fathers teach with one consent; in her head, the Pope, defining, & deliuering any thing publikely; & finally in the rule of faith which all the Church holdeth: though 
                     •
                  euerally some Bishops may priuately erre in teaching; and one or moe Fathers may write some vntrue thing, or be in some er

                  or; and somewhat euen in Coūcels, without the decree it self, may be said or reasoned inconueniently; and (to conclude) the Pope may be ouerseene priuately in somewhat. But this must be certes imputed to the frailtie of men, not to the Church

her selfe. Which speech of D. Stapletons if it be an aunswere vnto my argument: then can I tell him a very briefe way to aunswere my Conclusions all with one word. How? By graunting them all to be true. For though it were so, that nether Bishops teaching vniformely might erre, nor Fathers consenting, nor Councels in decrees, nor the Pope in publike and definitiue sentence, which I both In the thirde Co

But those wordes must certes (saith he) be imputed to the frailtie of men, not to the Church her selfe. Now certes M Doctor is a mery mā: who can shift an argument off with such a iest. As though the Church her selfe consisted not of men: and therefore must needes offend so through frailtie, the men offending so. The fourth and last point wherewith Staplet. princ. doct. l. 13. c. 9. he findeth fault, is, that amongst 
               In the fifth Conclusion. 
               the reasons why the Church of Rome is no sound member of the Catholike Church, I bring this, that, touching expounding of the Scripture, she condemneth all senses and meanings thereof, which are against the sense that her selfe holdeth, or against the Fathers cōsenting all in one. Whereof in that he gathereth that I allow not the expositions of the Fathers, yea, that I affirme that it is a marke and token of a false Church to admitte the ioint-consent of the Fathers in expounding of the scripture: he dooth me great wrong. For, though by folowing too much breuitie in Latin, I fell into obscuritie, and said not so plainly that which I would, and should, as in the English now I haue: yet that which I said, dooth cleere me of his sclaunder, as D.

               Fulke hath shewed; whom I can better thanke for his defending of me, then deserue

the praise that he hath geuen me therein. Nay, I was so far from noting that as faulty in the Church of Rome, that the faulte which I noted was her vile abusing the name of the Fathers against their iudgemēt in that point. For I declared straight in the words ensuing, that first shee autoriseth thereby her owne practise, as the right sense and meaning of the Scripture, though contrarie to it selfe: next, she alloweth the puddles of the Schoolemen, & wil haue thē taken for waters of life: lastly, when some Fathers gainsay her, she reiecteth them, because they all consent not and admitteth them who doo make for her, as hauing hit the mark. Of the which branches the last importeth not that I refuse the Fathers consenting all in one. The former two import that I condemne the frensie of the Church of Rome, mainteining her Dunses and deedes against the Fathers. But Conci

               Stapleton (I trust) should be censured, for placing the Pope in the one Pastours seate. Wherefore if they, who holde not the senses that the Fathers geue of the scriptures, be the false Church, as lib. 13. cap. 9. he teacheth vs: the false Church and the Church of Rome may claime kinred.

And this doth M. Martin reproue, both for that wherevpon I spake it, and for my kind of speeche. That, wherevpon I spake it, is (he sayth) that euery youth among vs, vpon confidence of his spirit, will controll not onely one but all the Fathers consenting together, if it be against that which we imagine to be the truth. In which wordes, by mentioning so all the Fathers consenting together, he bewrayeth the canker that consumed him. For I touched the credite of no more of them, then Io. Picus Mirand. in Apol.

My kind of speeche he noteth, for being very fine and figuratiue, as I thought. As I thought? did M. Martin see my hart? If not: hee might haue kept that thought within himselfe. For in truth, (to open it, because he presseth me so farre,) I thought in that figure Da veniam Cypriane.

For although I be a vaine and foolish youth, who spake so of Cyprian: yet S. Paule was not a vaine and foolish Apostle, whose doctrin I maintayned in it. These are (good Christian reader) the faultes of my Conclusions: al, that are noted by Stapleton & Martin, as farre as I know. If they or any other haue touched
