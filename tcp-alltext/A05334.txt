               THe chefe and principall thing (right honorable) apertaining to euery honorable personage (which thing is good too see that your honor doth well consider) is to walke in the garden of humilitie: & the direct way to the same, is to passe by the gate of vertu, whose foūdacion is ankerd to the fear and loue of God: for as by the one is couered the multitude of sinns, so by the other is obteyned blesednes, wysdō, and knowledge, whose godly preseuerāce therin will (no dought) much multyply the great and blessed benefits of almighty God, vpon your honour and all your whole seede and posteritie, Knowing therfor (ryght honorable) the great loue and affection which your honour euer hath and doth beare to vertu and good letters, I was therby moued the more boldly after I had printed this worke for the Lute deuided into three books: (the first an easey and playne methode to set al songs of eyght diuers tunes in tablature for the lute, the secōd how to hādel the lute, the third and last cōteineth diuers excelent tunes) to dedycate the same to your honour, nothynge doutinge but that it shall most acceptably come into your fauorable and sure protection. I therfore most humbly besech your honor too take this small gift in good part, which cōming as it were from your honor into the hands of many shall (I dought not) do many good.

               An Instruction to set all Musicke in Tablature for the Lute. The Preface of the Author.
               
                  TO begin by that is first necessaryly to be vnderstood, albeit I haue sufficiētly treated of it in another booke ioyned to this, which containeth an easie instruction to the plaine Tabletur of the Lute, and the ordering of the hand theruppon, the Reader must vnderstand that the fiue lynes represent the fiue stringes of the Instrument, and the space last belowe the sixt or great basse.
               Mine entent is now to teach them that are desirous to playe on the Lute, how they maye without great knowledge of Musicke set vppon that instrument all Ballets or songes, which they shall thinke good, so as they can onely sing, vt, re, my, fa, sol, la, & know the valuation or time of notes, without that that it shalbe néedefull for them any farther to wade for the knowledge of any composition or concordes, that is to say, that it shall suffise them to knowe that this note 
                     〈♫〉
                   called a sembrief, in the measure of two signified by this figure 
                     〈♫〉
                   differring from the measure of thrée commonly called Triplée, is in valew two minims 
                     〈♫〉
                   and two minims are asmuch as foure Cratchets, 
                     〈♫〉
                   foure Cratchets asmuch as eight quauers, 
                     〈♫〉
                   eight quauers asmuch as sixtéene semiquauers. 
                     〈♫〉
                   There resteth no more to consider but the little marke which is called a pricke, which alwayes is halfe asmuch in value as the note going before. As touching Triplée ye must vnderstand the like correspondence for the value of the notes therof.
               To enter then into the ground of this present Art: all our Musicke consisteth in eight tunes although Glarian and some other would deuide them into a greater number, as farre as twelue. The first whereof as consequently of all the rest we will treate of by rules and examples.
            
            
               The first Chapter of the first Tune of Musicke.
               FOR the first tune we wil take for exāple the song of Orland de Lassus beginning Quand mon mary viēt de dehors, in which we must firstly set the treble: the first note wherof being in gsolreut must be set on the second string of the Lute open, that is to lay, so as the finger of the left hand do not toutch vpon that string: although we sée in other tunes that the treble opē serueth for Gsolreut, and sometime for Ffaut, as in the sixt tune. True it is that such as be cunning in this Art, do dispose of them diuersly at their pleasure: but it is not to them that I direct my present worke. Now of these eight tunes there is made a difference of foure called the Master or principall tunes, that is to say, the first, the third, the fift, the seuenth, and of foure called their sequels or seruants, which be the second, the fourth, the sixt & the eight. Of these eight the first & second end in re, the third and fourth in my, the fift and sixt in fa, the seuenth and eight in sol: notwithstanding that there may be a changing or trasposition, as in the first and second tune from Re of Gsolreut, and from Re of Dlasolre, and so in the other of diuers My, Fa, sol. To retorne then to the discourse of the first tune, we haue to giue a reason wherfore we haue before ordered, that the second string of the Lute open

shal serue for Gsolreut, which is because this first tune hath his retche or compasse a fourth or foure notes higher then the second▪ as contrariwise the secōd hath his retch or cōpasse a fourth lower. So is it of the other six tunes, that euery Mastertune hath alwaies his retch or compasse higher by a fourth and the sequeles or seruaunt tunes, the base likewise contrary. Now must bée vnderstood the cause why herebefore we haue layed for foundation, that in setting songs to the Lute, we procéede by sembreues, Which is by occasiō of ye nature & dispositiō of this instrument, as it is likewise in that of y• Uirginalles, but cōtrary in Orgās. For in Orgās, the tune may hold a Maxim being as long as eight sembreues, yea and longer by meanes of the wind continu
                     ••
                   by the bellowes. But in the other two instruments their sound, which dependeth altogither by the toutch of the fingers, cannot endure longer then a sembreue: if the string on the one, or the key on the other, be not touched againe by the hand: which is the reason in consequence, that forceth vs when we set in Tablature, to deuide Maxims alwayes in eight partes, Longes in foure, Breues in two, and so forth of other great notes which are augmented with pricks. Herein lieth the reason for the Etimologie of the woord.
               To omit nothing of the whole instruction of the Tablature of the Lute, I haue diuised this foundaciō to be thereunto necessary: that is to saye, the māner of musick to set a song by setting forth the retch or compasse of all the notes in euery one of the foure partes, by examples of the first Tune in ye song Qand mon mary vient de dehors, where I haue set forth all the notes as far as they did retch in the whole making of that song. In the which I haue to aduertise you, that there is first to be seen, the letters of the tablature, aunswerable to the note of the song, and the vnissons which maye chaūce vppon ye strings of the Lute.
               Also the reader shall find in the example of the Base, that in the first note we were dryuē to haue recours to the eight aboue, as yt appereth in the Retche or compas: which must serue herafter for a generall rule in all other songs here giuen for examples: that is to wete, aswell for refuge to the said eights, as to the compasse of the note. Which I wold to be vnderstood for all songs of the first Tune, which ar to be set on the Lute: in which it cannot be often found that they excede this compasse aboue one note higher or lower. And so shall it be presupposed of the other Tunes following, and likewyse of the compasse of them. Here I will not forgette to tell that the learner of this Arte, may not faile after he hath set out his Treble in Tablature to tel diligently all the measures of the same, for feare of this Inconuenience, which chaunceth oftentymes, yea to the most expert for Lacke of this diligence, to goo ouer and beginne againe the woorke nowe already half doon, for that there maye happen to muche or to littell: so as if the foundacion be not good, all that is Laied vpon must nedes goo to ruyne.

                  TO beginne the example to set, first you must knowe, that this marke 
                     〈♫〉
                   like vnto a C, with a strike thorowe, signifieth the measure to be by the nomber of twoo, whiche hauyng no strike, betokeneth double measure, whiche the Italians call the blacke note: because that in that kinde of song, there are vsed many quauers yea, and sem
                     •
                  e quauers, whiche hapen verie seldome in the measure of twoo, as the Battaile, Caquet des femmes, chant des oyseaux, and suche other songes of Clement Ianequin. Now as touchyng the first drafte of this example, you see there the first note, a, to be in value a Minim, the seconde .d, in value a cratchet with the other next followyng, whiche is of the same value the former is, although it be not marked vpon: in whiche matter you shall knowe that this marke 
                     〈♫〉
                   is in value 
                     〈♫〉

                     〈♫〉
                   and this last 
                     〈♫〉
                   in value 
                     〈♫〉
                  . As for the prickes where soeuer thei chaunce, thei encrease the value of the note nexte before, by the one halfe, as it hath been shewed here before in the notes of Musick. As to the firste measure of the song of Orlande, we muste make the distaunce large enough (as it is to be obserued in all the reste) because there maie chaunce many Cratchettes or Quauers, in some other partes of the song, besides those of the treble: whiche as you se we doe here place first. For this cause the twoo distances, the fifte and the sixte bee seen voide, because of the restes of the treble there. Also in the seuenth distaunce, you see the firste marke to bee in value a Minim, whiche hauyng no letter vnderneth, signifieth there a Minim reste. The twoo strikes marked with prickes after the fiftenth distaunce, doe signifie that you muste repeate the line endyng there. In the distaunce nexte after the same strikes, after the reste, there is marked but the halfe of the value of the sembrieue standyng betwene bothe, whiche is notwithstandyng, marked whole in the song or Musick: because that the string beyng stricken once, doeth holde the sounde of the sembrieue: as it happeneth also sometyme of a Minim standyng so betwene bothe. You must also marke, that at the repetition shewed before, you must beginne at the seconde distaunce, noted with the marke to begin againe 
                     〈♫〉
                  
                  ▪ and not at the first distaunce whiche must be likewise at all tymes hereafter obserued, when so euer ye shall see that marke. Note also that the double strike, nexte the strike of repetition, doeth signifie that, that whiche is enclosed betwene them, must be left out in the plaiyng forthe of the song, after the repetition of the first parte of thesame.
               
                  AFter the marke of repetition, in the twelfth and eightenth distaunce, there be twoo markes 
                     〈♫〉
                  , without any letter vnderneth in Tablature, whiche signifieth so many halfe restes, 
                     〈♫〉
                  , in the Musick. In the laste distaunce beyng the ende of the treble, is the letter, a, alone, whiche tarieth for the ende of the other partes: repeatyng the laste woordes of the song. And this same self letter, a, shall continue still to sustaine, and accompanie the other partes to the ende, as long as thei shall holde out. In whiche must be noted and obserued that in settyng, the ende of any song muste neuer be closed, till all the partes bee ioyned together: for so muche as sometyme the treble holdeth the note, and sometyme some other of the partes.
               
                  
                  NOw it is conueniente for vs to declare the orderyng of the necke of the Lute, to wete, the vt, re, my, fa, sol, la, vpon the strynges, and of the tunes vpon the stops. There bee ordinarily eight stops in nomber: whereof euery one containeth but halfe a tune or note: and any stryng open hath his firste tune or note whole, so euery other note doeth take twoo stops: beyng none other difference, but of halfe a note from one stoppe to an other nexte, whiche is a thyng necessarie to bee vnderstoode for this presente woorke, to sette in Tablature. Also that from the greate Base, beyng open to the second
                     •
                   Base, called the firste stryng, are fower notes, from the firste stryng to the fowerth, are fower notes, from the fowerth to the thirde, three notes, from the thirde to the seconde, fower notes, and from that to the Treble, are also fower notes.
               
                  NOw as touchyng whole notes, and halfe notes, whereof we beganne to speake, it is to bee noted, that the chaunge, 
                     〈♫〉
                   commonly called b. sharpe or square, altogether differryng from b. flatte, in that b. sharpe doeth holde vp the 
                     •
                  une halfe a note higher, and b. flatte, contrarywise doeth lette it fall halfe a note lower, whiche chaunge is necessarie to bee knowen in euery descente of Musicke (this must be vnderstoode of the Treble) albeit thei doe not vse to marke them, in many sortes of songe, sauyng in this aswell in the Treble, as in the other partes. Whiche descente must be vnderstoode, to be like vnto the Treble, in what tune so euer it bee founde. And if the learner of this arte should not well vnderstande, that the chaunge into b. sharpe in the descente, doeth fall vpon the laste note saue one, he shall knowe it euidently by the marke, whiche I will not forget to set throughout all myne exāples. But he must also knowe, that the chaunge into b. sharpe, maie chaunce in any ther place, then vpon descentes. Also there resteth to consider, that in the vt, re, my, fa, sol, la, my towardes fa, doeth beare but half a note, nor fa, towardes my, that is to saie, aswell in goyng vpwarde, as commyng dounwarde, but bothe these in all other respectes, and also all other notes doe beare a whole note. Also euery note taketh twoo stops vpon the necke of the Lute, and the halfe note one stoppe onely: but .A. hath been put and sette forthe for a marke, betokenyng a whole note vpon euery stryng opon, then B. in the first stoppe in the toppe of the necke, a halfe note .C. an other halfe note in the seconde stoppe .D. in the thirde .E. in the fowerth .F. in the fifte .G. in the sixte .H. in the seuenth .I. in the eight: whiche bee the nomber of the stoppes, moste accustomed vpon the necke of this instrumente, notwithstandyng, that thei doe not lette to goe further towarde the knotte vpon the bealie of the Lute, by the guidyng and iudgement of the eare.
               HAuyng vnderstoode the maner how to sette the Treble in Tablature, we must now in proceadyng, se to the other partes, beginnyng at the high Tenour, called in Latine Contratenor▪
                   whiche is nexte to the highest, or Treble: whereof here followeth the example.

                  VPon this beginnyng of ioynyng the Treble with the Countertenour in Tablature, is to bee noted the excellencie of the Lute aboue the Uirginalles, in the first accorde of this songe, in that the .F. there dooeth furnishe the vnisson, fillyng so muche the more the Harmonie. In whiche accorde, and the nexte followyng, because the Treble occupieth the place of the Countertenour: we were forced to set the .F. vpon the thirde stryng, where the vnisson of the .A. of the seconde stryng is. You must marke that in the eight distaunce in the Treble parte, as it was first set out alone, there were marked twoo Minims: but in this seconde example, wherein is added the Countertenour, we haue been driuen to chaunge those twoo Minims into fower Cratchettes, because of the aunsweryng of the pricke, and the three Cratchettes, whiche meete there in the Countertenour: and yet neuerthelesse, the twoo Minims kepe their part still in the instrument. And in the thirtene distaunce, ye maie see twoo Minims first together, that is to saie, bothe of the Treble and Countertenour, but the seconde Minim of the Treble, whiche was in the first example single, in this (whiche is as it were a seconde or double example) is necessarily conuerted into a Cratchet, because of the pricke, and the Cratchet of the Countertenour. Here muste bee noted, that where soeuer there chaunceth a pricke, it shalbe alwaies beste for the easinesse of the Tablature, to tourne that pricke into the figure of the note of his Tune or value, to aunswere to the other notes, of the partes commyng together: as is to be perceiued that I haue vsed in all this booke. Likewise in the laste note .A. of the Treble (whiche is in this example double of twoo partes) marked in the twoo distaunces, the laste saue one, and the last, because) as it hath been tolde alreadie) of holdyng the ende, the Semibreue is of necessitie tourned into Cratchettes.

                     IN this example of Trasposition, we must consider once for all, that although the ende of this song of Aacadet (of whiche alwaies the iudgemente is made) doeth fall and ende in Dlasolre, it is neuerthelesse, taken for like to the former example of Orlande, whiche endeth in Gsolreut. Also we make no difference of Tune▪ but make hym ende vpopn the Lute, on the same seconde stryng open. There remaineth to prescribe, or obserue in settyng, that as ofte as there is one, twoo, or mo restes in any song, as in the firste distaunce of the Treble of this present, that you beginne alwaies to set in Tablature, the marke of the Semibreue, because it shall bee easie for you, if there happen any shorter measure in any of the other partes, to conuert that marke of Semibreue, into a Minim, Cratchet, or Quauer.

               ¶The seconde Chapiter of the seconde Tune.
               THis seconde Tune, whiche is called folower, or seruaunt to the first maister Tune, because he hath his reche or compasse a fowerth lower, therefore it behoued vs to set hym so muche the higher, that is to saie, in the Treble open which shall serue for Gsolreut, where it was in the seconde stryng open in the first Tune. In this example of the Treble, I haue to aduertise you vpō the fowerth distaunce, in which ye se a marke of the value of a Minim, without any other letter in the Tablature vnder it, that thesame procedeth because of the pricke, whiche is in the Musick ioyned to a Semibreue of the third distauce: and that folowyng a rule, which we haue giuen you before, that the Lute strikē out once, could not hold the sound aboue the time of one semibreue: whiche must bee vnderstoode for the perfection of the more greater harmonie: albeit that the sounde of the stryng, might partly endure the value of a pricke added, or of the half more, but the sound towards the ende is alwaies naturally of lesse force, as the seconde sounde of an Echo in his doublyng. So maie the pricke of the Semibreue (as it shall like hym that setteth, be left out frō beyng marked with any letter in Tablature, or els be marked by the discretion, and iudgement of the eare. For it is certain that the sounde is more strong, and of longer tariyng, accordyng to the goodnes of the Lute.

But because the .H. whiche must be in the place of .C. of the Treble, the placyng of the twoo .FF. did come to better purpose, for the art and grace of the plaiyng. Also because these twoo, A.A. had doen wrong to occupie the place & tune of the .F. of the Treble whiche is in value a Minim and a pricke, whiche must bee obserued generally in euery like hap, vpon what stryng so euer it bee: whiche thyng often vse in settyng diuerse songes, will teache sufficiently.

                  o would bryng an inconuenience in the pricke .B whose sounde would be loste, in goyng to the nexte stoppe. To preuent whiche, we will amende them otherwise, in the example of fower partes together hereafter, tournyng the .B. here into .G. vpon the thirde stryng (whiche is his vnisson) likewise the .D. into .H. vpon the fowerth stryng▪ which beyng so brought to perfection▪ shal be in that order also more easie for the hande: besides the necessitie it hath by reason of the stop of the next distaunce, of whiche also the twoo .D.D
                  ▪ of the thirde stryng be to be chaunged into as many .H.H. vpon the fowerth stryng.

                     IN the presente song giuen for example of Transposition of the seconde Tune, in the .F. whiche is the seconde Minim of the twenteth distaunce, we haue to consider the loste Tune of the eight, of the .F. belowe, whiche happeneth often in our plaine ordinarie Lutes, whiche be but of eleuen strynges, and might easely bee remedied by settyng the song one note or twoo higher, but it would be harder for the hande, and the grace of the plaie would bee woorsser. Truthe it is, that it were possible to supplie that lacke vppon our plaine Lutes, by settyng the base a note lower, but that would make the plaie a greate deale harder, because it would cause a chaunge of all the letters of the greate Base. The Lutes of the newe inuention with thirtene strynges, bee not subiecte to this inconuenience, whereof the laste is put be lowe: whiche accordyng to the maner now adaies, is thereby augmented a whole fowerth: where here before it was vsed onely to supplie the lacke of this one note, whereof wee speake now. I will not here forget to tell you, that cunnyng Maisters (to giue remedie to this defecte) heighten their plaie vpon the Tablature, as many notes as thei thinke good. Here resteth yet to consider vpon that we haue spoken of before, concerning the pricke, how it is to bee kepte with his note: notwithstandyng in the .83. distaunce of this example, we bee constrained to lose hym, by reason of the Tunes, whiche mingle and passe one emong an other: whiche also maie bee founde in some other distaunces followyng.

                  IN the 23. distaunce of this song, Du corps absent, we haue to shewe the reader, that in place of an .F. in the laste Minim of that measure, in the seconde example of thesame song, garnished with runnyng poinctes, ye shall finde thesame .F. chaunged into .D. with a double passage, kepyng the fall, whiche was corrupted in .F. neuerthelesse the Tune self of thesame .F is founde in thesame compainie, and eight of the greate fift stryng: whiche reason could not be in Lutes, tuned after the maner of Fabrice Dentice the Italian, and of other his followers. Where those strynges that stande twoo and twoo together, bee sette in one Tune, and not by eightes, whiche thei doe for a perfectiō of harmonie, in auoydyng many vnissons, whiche those eight would cause. In the .27. distaunce likewise it will be to be considered, that the letters whiche be set, accordyng to their naturall order vpon the laste Minim (makyng the accorde of Musicke) doe bryng a hardnes of plaie, beyonde the power of the hande, in the greater sorte of Lutes, although vpon lesse instrumentes, or to a verie greate hande well exercised, it might be possible. For this cause our scholer, whiche will not contente hymself of this plaine and naked Tablature, maie haue recourse to thesame distaunce in the Tablature followyng, where he shall finde thesame accordin his perfection, notwithstandyng the chaungyng of letters.

               ¶The fifte Chapiter of the fifte Tune.
               
                  IN this example of the song of Orlande of the fifte Tune, beginnyng, Trop endurer, wee muste declare, that the plaie is muche constrained, and the hande forced, and the notes of the same all contrary to ordinarie, because that the .C. whche for the moste parte in other Tunes serueth for my, here serueth for sol, and so consequently of the other letters. For this cause I haue put an other song after this of the same Tune, a note lower, to shewe the easines of the one, in respecte of the other. Notwithstandyng, the constrainte is so muche the more perfite, because of the losse of some note in the Base of the other. It remaineth to shewe here, that in the 64 distaunce, the pricke of the Minim of the Base is there loste, and it cannot be doen otherwise, but by the florishyng of them that be cunnyng, as maie be seen in the seconde Tablature of thesame song.

                   in the 34, distaunce, there is a place in the Tenour followyng the Musicke, in the whiche there is founde a greate difficultie, and strainyng of the hande, so as it cannot bee plaied, without takyng the hande of, whiche causeth the sounde of the other partes to ceasse, whiche is one of the greateste faultes and inconuenience that can happen to the plaier on the Lute, whiche errour the common sorte for the moste parte doe fall into, excepte suche as be excellent doers in this arte, wherefore it is better to make that place all plaine, without takyng of the hande, although it bee marked double in the Musick: because so there is nothyng loste of the perfection, seyng it is not doubled, but for pleasure and ioye of the harte, more then for any occasion of the accorde, or of the harmonie: So shall you finde how to vse this place in the example followyng, more cunnyngly set forthe.

                  THis sixt Tune, whiche is seruaunt or suffrigan of the firste Tune before, hath his compasse or reche a fowerth lower, then his maister in Musicke, as also all the rest of the folowers haue. Of whiche Tune I giue you here for example, the Song of Orland, beginnyng, En vu lieu ou l'on ne voit goutte, whiche endeth in Ffaut, to the whiche the greate Base of the Lute serueth open, notwithstandyng, that in many of the other Tunes, it serueth for Gsolreut, and for other also, whereof I will not make you a certaine rule, and speciall determination, because thesame passeth by the discrecion of the maister, who to make hymself sporte in his plaie, or to ioyne with some other Instrumentes, whereof he would make a noise, doeth sette hym high or lowe, without makyng any scruple for the losyng sometyme of some little note. Wee will not repete here the rule for Tripler, whereof this song is full in many places, that there three muste bee obserued for twoo vnder one measure, because we haue sufficiently declared it in former Chapiters. The scholer maie not thinste it straunge, if while the Treple dure, he findeth but Minims marked in the Tablature in steade of Semibreues. The reason is, for that where there should be so many Breues, thei must be stricken twise, whiche were but a foolishe maner. For we haue alreadie tolde, that a good Lute will holde his sounde, as long as a Semibreue, and his pricke, and the Brief in Triple is no more in valewe, wherefore to make plaine this hardnes, I haue marked the Semibreues into Minims, whiche for all that, shall goe no faster nor slower, then if thei were Semibreues, beyng no difference nor perfection, more in the one, then in the other.

               ¶The seuenth Chapiter of the seuenth Tune.
               
                  WE will frame an example in Tablature, for this seuenth maister Tune, vpon the song of Orlande, beginnyng Ie ne veux rien q'un baiser de sa bouche. Whiche to them that should bee ouermuche scrupulous for the losse of certaine notes (whiche notwithstandyng, doe recompense them selues vpon the eightes, as it is to bee seen in the ende of this song) suche would sette it twoo notes higher, to saue those notes: but thei would because of greate difficultie, muche vnpleasauntnesse, and constrainte, so that we thinke it better to leaue it in his naturall Tune, then to chaunge it otherwise. Because that this Tune of his ordinarie propertie, is not accustomed to extende to those twoo loste notes, so lowe as the Musician would here for the poursuite and excellencie of his pastyme. Now is there in this song present, many thynges worthie to bee noted, in certaine distaunces of thesame, albeit that in the example better poolished followyng, there is remedie to bee perceiued for all the difficulties, but the reader could not perceiue them, because the knowledge could not be had but in the setting. The first is in the seuenth space, where the highest C. must holde a whole Semibreue for the Countertenour, if the diuision in the Treble did not take awaie one quauer from him whiche thou shalt finde the meanes to saue vnto hym in the .22. distaunce folowyng. In the .16. distaunce there is a runnyng point whiche is made to obserue the letters with the Musick: whereby bothe the Tenour and the Base bee letted, wherefore it is better there to make that pointe all plaine, then so muche to hinder those twoo partes, although it bee not to bee seen so in this distaunce (alreadie by me amended there) as it is set out in the Musicke. In the .31▪ distaunce is laste the pricke of the Countertenor in the beginnyng of the measure, where there is place to haue set him, but wee haue tolde before that the pricke is not stricken, wherefore it is better lefte out then stricken againe. In the .65. distaunce, the seconde Minim leeseth half his valure, by reason of a Cratchet in the Treble, and cannot be otherwise doen, for the constraine of the other partes.

                     WE doe yet further present here vnto you one song, by waie of accessary, whiche is of Orlande, beginnyng Las voulez vous qu'une personne chante. Although it might seme superfluous to put it in Tablature, to them that would in this followe the common opinion, whiche place is vnder the seconde Tune, but to many it semeth otherwise. For so muche as this Tune, of the whiche there bee founde sondrie songes and ballettes, doeth ende in Alamire, without transposition, and beyng transposed in Dlasolre, by b. sharpe. In this example here sette forthe vnto you, there is seen in the 13. distaunce (whiche hath been often seen in some other of the former examples) that is to saie the laste halfe of the Minime of the Base, by reason of the commyng of a certaine passage trauersyng, as it is ordinarily founde in all Musicke. In the .35. distaunce there is founde a like difficultie in that, that of necessitie, the halfe of the laste Minim must be loste of the Treble, or of the Countertenour. But the beste is to leaue out the laste Cratchette of the Countertenour, whiche is cause of this trouble, as you maie see that I haue lefte hym out in the seconde Tablature of thesame song, more cunnyngly sette forthe. In the .82. distaunce is loste the pricke of the first Minim of the Base, but the place of this pricke is voide, whiche I will acco
                        •
                     mpt a fault to strike againe, as ye shall perceiue by the laste handlyng of this presente song, that is to saie, that in place of the accorde on high, wee haue put hym in the eight beneath. For ende and conclusion of this woorke, wee haue none other thyng to holde you with, but that it hath not been by negligence, or not takyng heede, that wee haue not added yet more examples of songes and ballettes of three, fiue, sixe, seuen, and eight partes. But I haue doen it by reason, that who shalbe diligently exercised in the Tablature of fower partes onely: whiche I haue set forthe in this boke, shall not finde any newe difficultie, in that he would sette mo partes: that is to saie, that there is no further thyng to bée considered and obserued, but the rules largely set forthe and desciphered by our Chapiters, as aboue all, the chaunge and alteration of the value of notes of one parte, in the commyng in and ioynyng with the other partes Also that there must bee excused some leauyng out of accordes, sometyme for the necessitie of the bearyng of the instrument, whiche is not for all that, to condempne the Lute alone of imperfection: the Harpe, Uirginals, and other made of like harmonie, hauyng all nede of like excuse.

               ¶The first Rule.
               First thou must vnderstande, that the Lute is commonly strung with sixe strynges, I saie sixe strynges, although there bee eleuen because the fiue first, accoumptyng from the Base, be doubled, whiche make tenne, and the Treble is onely single and alone, whiche maketh the eleuenth, as thou maiest perceiue by the figure of the Lute, whiche I haue here represented vnto thee.
            
            
               ¶The seconde Rule.
               These sixe strynges bee figured by fiue straight lines, of the whiche, the firste do

                  oth signifie the highest stryng, called the Treble, the seconde line is the seconde stryng, and so consequently all the other vnto the sixt, the whiche sixt line, is not noted in our Frenche Tablature, because it maie easely be iudged to be the last.
               
                  Treble.
                  Small meane.

               ¶The thirde Rule.
               And because these sixe cordes bee not sufficient of them selues, to expresse many and diuerse soundes, it is necessarie to finde meanes, whereby euery stryng maie giue many and diuerse soundes, and the meanes and waie thereof, is the inuention of the frettes, whiche thou seest aboute the necke of the Lute here figured.
               
               FOr to speake of the frettes, I will not here declare the proportions, that ought to bee obserued, to saie, the space or distaunce betwixte frette and frette, whiche wee doe call stoppes, for to compasse them iustly, nor the greatnesse of the frette strynges, whiche must bee also obserued, these thynges shalbe declared an other tyme, thou shalte contente thy self, to marke what I will now saie vnto thee.
            
            
               
               ¶The fowerth Rule.
               
                  WE call the frettes, the stringes that bee tied about the necke of the Lute, whiche be ordinarily eight in nom

In the Frenche Tablatorie is vsed the letters of the Alphabet, and the Italians and other nations, in steade thereof, vse Sciphers and other Carecters.

               THe first stoppe is signified and marked by the letter b. the seconde .c and so consequently the rest, vnto the eight and last stop, with the letter .i. As thou maiest see by the figure of the Lute, whiche I haue before represented vnto thee.

(which we haue set last) thei haue no frettes, notwithstādyng those that be exercised in thesame arte, stoppe the strynges iustly, where thei should bee stopped, that is to saie, where the letters be marked, whiche bee euer aboue the nomber of eight, as cunnyngly as if thei had frettes.

               ¶The eight Rule.
               
                  NOw seyng the letters doe signifie the stoppes (the whiche dooe onely appertaine to the lefte hande) if you should not strike the saied strynges beneth on the beallie, the Lute would giue no sounde: you must with the thombe, and the fingers of the right hande, gripe or strike as many strynges, as shalbee founde letters marked in the lines, signifiyng the saied strynges▪ I meane, that shalbee one aboue an other in thesame stoppe: and if there bee but one letter, you muste stoppe but one stryng, if there be twoo, you must onely stoppe twoo, and so consequently to the nomber of sixe, which maketh sixe partes in one stoppe, because euery letter doth his parte, and there muste bee twoo letters at the leaste, one aboue the other, to make the accorde.

                  WHereas thou doest finde but one letter to bee stopped, thou shalte strike hym dounewarde with thy thombe, bee it firste, second, or other, the stryng signified by the line of the Tablatorie, vpon thesame line that the letter standeth on, so that there bee vnder that letter no poincte or pricke. For if there bee one, it muste bee striken vpwardes with one of the fingers, as shall best fit it.

                  IF you dooe finde one, twoo, or three letters, hauyng no pricke or poincte vnderneth, you shall strike vpwardes as many strynges, as you shall finde letters vpon the lines of the Tablature, signifiyng the saied strynges, with as many fingers as there bee letters and strynges, and you muste also note, that although there bee but one poincte or pricke vnder one, twoo, or three letters, thei must bee all striken with the fingers, without the thombe, as if euery letter were marked seuerally with his pricke or poincte.

                  IF vnder twoo, three or many letters comprised in one stoppe, bee founde no pricke or poincte, then you muste gripe, or drawe as many strynges, as there bee founde letters: gripyng, or drawyng▪ is to bee vnderstoode, when the thombe and the fingers of the right hande plaie together.

                  BEcause it shalbe hereafter necessarie for the vnderstandyng of the Tablature, to knowe the diuision of the hand and the fingers, and with what names I will surname them, I will aduertise thee, that after the thombe, the nexte followyng shalbe the firste, nexte vnto that shalbe the seconde, the thirde to bee the thirde, and the little finger to bee named the little finger.
