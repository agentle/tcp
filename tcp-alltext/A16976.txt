            To all the learned Nobilitie of England, HVGH BROVGHTON wiſheth all increaſe of knowledge, that they may eſteeme the vnderſtanding of Gods worde, and care for ſynceritie in it, to be the head of wiſedome and true Religion in CHRIST.
            
               WHEREAS many (right Honorable) from the high to the low, of all ſortes haue bene deſirous greatly and a long time, to haue the holy booke of God, which for the old Teſtament is in Ebrew, for the new all originally in Greeke, to be tranſlated and beautified with all furniture for playnes and ornaments: that ſuch as ſtudie it, ſhould in no place be ſnared by the tranſlater: but rather in all poinctes might haue at the firſt layd cleare before them all that ſtudie can affoord: It may be thought a good help to the bringing of their deſire to paſſe, by ioyning of al effectuallie in executiō of the worke: to ſhewe what in this paynes may be better done then yet we haue in Englande. And as bare ſhortnes is ſooneſt viewed: ſo matter of large, longe, high & deepe quantitie, ſhalbe brought into ſpeach of no greatnes, but narrow, ſhort, lowe & ſhallowe, that the meaneſt may in good part iudge, what ought to be cenſured.What poinctes a ſyncere tranſlation ought to haue, mo thē yet oure haue. The holy text muſt be honored, as ſound, holy, pure: hede muſt be taken that the tranſlater neither flow with lyes nor haue one at all: prophecies ſpoken in doubtfull termes, for ſad preſent occaſiones, muſt be cleared by ſad ſtudy and ſtayd ſafty of ancient warrant: termes of equivocation witty in the ſpeaker for familiar and eaſy matters, muſt be looked vnto, that a tranſlater drawe them not vnto fooliſh & ridiculous ſenſes: Conſtant memorye to tranſlate the ſame often repeated in the ſame

ſort is moſt nedefull. Facility of phraſe, defended by the new Teſtament, the Septuagint, and writers old indifferent for all nations, muſt be had. And herein, the ſtately words of the new Teſtament, in Greeke, taken frō the Septuagint may ſtand profitable in the margent through the old. Alſo where the later repeat the former holy writers, therein as it were commenting vpon them, that ſhould in all clearnes be expreſſed, and noted. Theſe be poinctes of neceſſitie. Some others of ornament in the end of our ſpeach may be conſydered. Thus all are briefly told once: which by enlargement will appeare more pleaſant. And ſpeach of all ſhalbe vſed, by your honorable pacience. Firſt a Tranſlater of the Bible ſhould beware leaſt of his owne head in tranſlation or notes,1. care that the holy Ebrew or holie Greeke text bee not diſannulled he diſanull the text: and blame the watchfull eye of Gods providence, for not preſeruing the writt aright. That fault is exceeding great, for a man to take vpon him to bee wiſer then God: and to take his kingly care tardy, in trueth of wordes. All men will graunt that there is not an idle plant, fiſhe, worme, foule, or beaſt in nature, nor yet ſtarre in the ſkye: but all knowen and looked vnto by Gods care. Now wheras all that would be happy are commaunded to thinke day and night on Gods Lawe by the ſpirit of endles wiſedome: as learning the Eternall better thence then from the creatiō: we might haue bin ſure that the father of light,An holy 21. fold Alphabet, a matter of brauerie, telleth babes that God would neuer faile in a

                  . would neuer require that: but would alſo for his part affoorde a lawe, voyde of trappe and ſnare: to delight the ſoules that followe him. That matter of neceſſitie may better bee conceaued by thinges of ornament, into which God for vs hath condeſcended. A man would little haue thought that the moſt High ſhould make Alphabets for vs in his booke. But wee nowe may ſee it done. The Pſal. 25. hath an Alphabet, ſaving for two letters: and the Pſalme is a generall forme of prayer. There the wiſeſt may try, whither any wiſedome could ſupply the argument,

by Ebrewe wordes of ſage force. The Pſal. 145. is alike,Pſalm. 145. Nun onelie is omitted. Pſa▪ 34. hath an ouerplus Pſa. 37. hath an Alphabet with much enterlacing. Pſal. 211. & 12. in

The Pſal. 37. hath an Alphabet moſt exact, though many verſes ſeeme to hide it. The Pſalme 111. conteyneth Gods laude. The 112. the Godly mans: in moſt curious ſorte, for euery member of ſpeach. The 119. goeth vppon commendation of the Lawe of life: with an eightfold Alphabet, and mentioning the worde in ſundry names in euery verſe: what vertues it hath. Which ſayings cōming from him that carieth about all things by his mightie worde, ſhould aſſure vs, that it was ſafely kept.Matrones vertues in Alphabet. Pro. 31. Salomon in like battell-ray hath commended good Matrones: that they teachinge their children from the breaſtes, ſhould giue them the milke of Gods worde. And Ieremy at the kingdomes ruine penneth his Lamētations with a watchfull eye, very much for phraſe: vſing frō

But his Alphabet is more wonderfull, to ſhewe in mans confuſion, Gods diſtinction. So the firſt Cha. hath 22. verſes in the 22. letters order. The Ch. 2. to ſtirre our care hath the like with changing place of Pe, and Ain, two going togither, but the later going afore: ſo the fourth Chap. is moſt exact in the ſame ſorte, for Pe and Ain: and all the other in due order: that by this doubled matter, ſtudie ſhould be ſtirred vp.

Theſe being matters of Elegācy more then bare neceſſitie,Matters curious in elegancie. ſhew that no leſſe watchfulnes was ouer the wordes of ſentences. Which thing ſhould moue vs to holde the text vncorrupt.The 148. margent readings. Beſides a matter of ſingular great importance commeth hither to be conſidered: the margent readinges of the old teſtament. They are eight hundred fourtie and eight in number. And the word in the text was not read, but the

worde in the margent. Theſe greatlie touch all to knowe why ſo it falleth out:
                  Chriſtians be lothſome that ſlander the holy prouidence, as not prouiding wel for them: where vnſpeakeable care is ſhewed, for their tendering.
                  22. times Naar in the Ebrew text is read Naarah.
                that Chriſtians no longer followe Kimchi and Ephody the Iewes, whom Barbinel & Elias Leuita damne of great iniurie done to Gods holy Maieſtie, for ſayinge that the text was corrupted in Babylon. Any may ſee that no Scribe would twentie two times of negligence write Naar, a Gyrle, for Naarah: the margent terme read for Naar: which ſignified a Boye or Gyrle: and for weightie cauſe was read Naara a Gyrle. The filthy towne Zebyim, burnt frō heauen, named of the pleaſaunt ſituatiō, the Roes, a name of Chriſt in Salomons ſonge, was read Zeboyim, all the foure times that ſcripture hath it. Errour could not fall into ſuch wiſedome. Likewiſe when Rabſakes filthy termes are in the text to be ſeene, but clearer in the margent to be read, they who ſay, that corruption bred this vrbanity, weigh not but caſt lottes what to ſpeake. So for bookes written after the captiuitie, paſt times of bondage: where the Samaritanes ſpeach againſt the Temple-builders, is as they ſpoke it, doubtfull Ebrew:Margēt readinges in bookes ſet forth after the captiuitie, ſince when Iewes had no hinderance to ſaue the dayly read text, argue the ſlaunderers of dulnes vpon groſſe impiety. as, We doe not ſacrifice: or, Sacrifice we not? there in Loa, and Lo, the word of the text and margent expound one the oher. And againe in Zacharie ſpeaking of Ieruſalems deſtruction & womens vſage by ſouldiers groſſe to ſpeake: the text telleth the terme to be ſeene: the margent, what the holy Spirit would haue read. Thus for ciuilitie or facilitie in ſenſe: the margent reading is giuen with equall authoritie as the other. Moreouer, wheras the Prophetes deepe ſkill, that omits the particle Vau, that is And, in a ſpeach of two members, or hath a worde too ſharpe for the common ſorte, in orthography ſtraunge, & differs in a letter from the vſuall manner: the margent hauinge the vſuall ſheweth what care the holy Synagogue had, that no one ſyllable ſhould amaze the ſimple, but were all taught from God to couple diligence with eaſie ſenſe. Theſe poinctes, ſome touche euery tounge, ſome onlie Ebrewe grammer:

where a learned profeſſour would as ſoone looke to ſwallowe a camel, as to eſcape blame, in vnheedines herein.Succeſſion of rare godlie men, all Babels raign prooue all babes who thinke that all copies in ſo ſhort time could be corrupted or anie one loſt. Mardochai was captiued, whiche they that denie may ſee here what thanks Chriſtians and Iewes wold kenne them 2 Sam. 20.8 Enochs ſpeach and Michaels wer framed Rhetorically of Ebrew DD. from Moſes ſhort ſpeaches: the like wherof is yet in their cōmentaries Talmud rabbi Nathan, & Midras Debarim. And further off would he be from thinking that Babel cauſed one letter amiſſe, when Ieremie liued til Ezra was of vnderſtāding, Ezechiel prophecieth vnto thirtie fiue yeares of the captiuitie: the exact halfe: and Daniel was there all the while, the marrowe of Godlines, learning, witte, and wiſedome: and the wealthieſt ſubiect in the worlde: that hee could want no will, ſkill, nor abilitie to keepe all ſcripture which the holy wiſdome of God ſawe needefull to make vp the body of Ebrewe holy ſtorie. Mardochai was next him in time of captiuitie, and godlines: and an holy Writer, as he: of equall authoritie in Daniels end of life, or aged about 110. yeares: he as well with Aggei, Zachary, Ezra, & ſuch would haue an eye to the text his ſoundneſſe. Wherefore tranſlatours herein fall fouly, when they ſay that Michal is put for Merob: or vpon Iude complaine of bookes loſt, for Enochs ſpeach: or Michaels. That is a principall poinct to be looked vnto: the obſeruations wherevpon will lighten eyes to much further ſight into Gods worde. In this matter the Maſsorites care ſhould be opened: Grammarians of Ebrew ſprong from Ezra and long continued: who reckoned euerie letter howe often in the holy Ebrewe it came: howe ofte wordes of ſhort or full writings were diuerſly written & where: and what ſtrange texts would ſeeme corruptions to the vnſtayed: and for Eth and Vau, little particles howe often they come together in ſort eaſie to deceyue a copyer, without a table of direction: ſuch poinctes are a braſen wall to ſaue frō doubt of ſcriptures certeintie: and frō extreeme raſhnes: that condemne as faultie, things of heauenlie ſynceritie. So when we come to tranſlate Achaz king of Iſrael:2 Chro. 28.19. 2 Chr. 21.2 or Ioſaphat king of Iſrael: we ſhould with the Maſsorites note the ſtraūgenes, that Iſrael is put for Iuda: and checke the Rhemiſt, that marking that title in Achaz but not in Ioſaphat, rageth

againſt the text as though it had bene corrupt and would therevpon drawe vs from Gods worde vnto a Church, and to Rome:
               Strange ſayings vppon rare occaſiō make Rhomiſtes and Rhemiſtes blaſpheme, whereby all their skill in ſcripture is ſoone ſeene, Ebrew elegācy ſtrange in other nations, but ful of effect, by the Prophetes very Pithy ſhortnes made vs blame ſpeaches moſte witty & far from corruption. by whoſe policie Chriſt was crucified: while they runne from miſchief to miſchief. The like care muſt bee vſed for the newe Teſtament: and more iudgement: be cauſe Chriſtians tooke not the like heede: as not being in equall daunger. Here we haue committed groſſe faultes, blaming moſt learned ſpeaches. For example ſome ſhalbe brought: The holy Ghoſt in Greeke ſpeaketh thus: Iocob dyed in Egypt, and the Patriarches, & they were caried to Sychem: And they were put in graue: That which Abraham bought for price of mony, That from the ſonnes of Emor of Sychem. Here the Pronowne They, the cloſe repetition of the Pronowne, That, & omiſſion of the copulatiue, vſuall in Prophetes, rare in common ſpeach, cauſed vs to amende the holy text: to leaue Iacobs buriall vntold, who yet was principal in the narration: to ſay that Abraham was put for Iacob: and to falſifie the buying For price of money: as though Iacob had bought his plot for money and not for Lambes, as the Greeke tranſlation expoundeth Iacobs price.Gen. 33.19. Ioſ. 24.32. Iob. 42.12. and is no more vſed in Ebrewe, and the 70. were borne in the end of the Ebrew 
                     •
                  on̄g, the eldeſt & beſt warrāt for tranſlating. 
               Keſhita is tranſlated Lambes in the Seuentie: whoſe tranſlation for common wordes, the newe Teſtament checketh not, but followeth moſt exactly, & infinitely: So that we may wel know, that Saint Luke writing in Greeke, meant the graue that Abraham bought for price of money: and that wherein Iacob was buried: & not that wherein the Patriarkes were buried. Whereby there can be no colour, that Abraham in the text was put for Iacob: but in the whole ſentence the Tranſlatours dealing weakened our ſtrength, & diſgraced the grace of holy ſynceritie. That the ſimple may better vnderſtande what I blame, you ſhall haue the tranſlation vſed of vs, which marreth the Greeke: and the annotations vpon it, which condemneth that which God cōmendeth vnto vs. And I hope no man of grace wilbe angrie to haue Scripture cleared,

nor vexe me any more with graue Fathers. If they that blame haue anie grauitie or drop of grace, they will wiſhe all men diſgraced, rather then one ſyllable of Gods worde. And they who muſt cōfeſſe vnſkilfulnes, ſhall not doe wel, vnleſſe they willinglie doe yeeld vnto the trueth, and loue the honor of God more then their own: and make it plaine vnto the people: that the booke which we call the Bible is the Hebrewe for the olde, the Greeke for the newe: and tranſlations are but ſo farre as they are true and exact from the originall: and without hinderance may and muſt bee examined by the other: yea where they are blameleſſe and ſyncere, by the originall their clearenes & authoritie muſt aye be ſtrengthened by the Ebrew. Thus the text ſtandeth:The text all tranſlated. And Iacob dyed both he and our Fathers, and were caried ouer into Sychem, & layde in the ſepulchre that Abraham bought for money of the ſonnes of Emor the ſonne of Sy

               l no more turne the ſword with Stephanas againſt their owne hart, after ſight how their caſe is well if they knew their own good things. Saint Stephen ſpeaketh in his moſt heauenlie oration other wiſdome of exact ſkill, yet blamed of great men. Vr by him is in Meſopotamia: and his deadlieſt enemie Barbinel, doth therein defende him full learnedly: but we cōmonly ſeeke qualifications vnartificial, whereby a Turke or Iewe would ſay that we made him but a lier. Saint Stephen ſayth, that Abraham was brought by God from Charan after his fathers

death: but we make the ſpeach vttered Gen. 12.1. to be ſpoken in V R, a calling as wel of Therah, as of Abraham, yet Moſes order of ſpeach defendeth: who ſheweth that Terah died in Charan, vpō whoſe death he endeth his The Peraſhah in the Law is a full ſeparatiō of matter, whiche may not be confounded. ſection, to make a ſeparation full and abſolute, from the matter following of Abrahams calling. Philo the Greeke Iewe (vnlike the late malicious) is fully of Stephens minde, and ſheweth that opinion, to haue bene then generall But Iewes malice being increaſed, ſhuffled the promiſe made to Abraham, into three ſcore yeares of Terahs life: ſo to obſcure all the matter: as not being Abrahams peculiar, in Terahs life time. Saint Stephen his Angelique tongue might haue holpen here, but that we pervert his words. Yet I am not to ſpeake much here of this matter, becauſe this poinct toucheth not corruption of text: vnleſſe we vrge that our ſhufflinge of Abrahams promiſe into Terahs life, and tranſlatinge thus: Gen. 12.1. The Lord had ſayde vnto Abraham, get thee, &c. being referred vnto his calling from Vr, prooues the Peraſha or Ebrew ſection very vnfit, in the middle of a matter: as doubtles it ſhould be moſt vnfit. So, this ſpeach may properlie belonge to the writt and letter. But this matter doeth moſt touche the ſecond poinct, of making ſcripture falſe by ill trāſlating, rather then blameth the text. One place more hath the holy martyr, as Saint Luke did penne it, where ſome blame the writt,How 70. in Gen. 46. & 75. Act. 7. be reconciled without blame of copy. and moe can not tell what they may ſay of it. Saint Luke Act. 7. maketh Iacobs familie to be of ſeauentie fiue ſoules, whereas Moſes in Ebrew hath but ſeauentie. And an Arabique tranſlation, written (as none are yet printed I trowe) brought vnto me from the Indianes, hath but ſeauentie ſoules. Here is matter for a ſkilfull tranſlatour to worke vpon:By my learned friende M. Phil. Nicols, beeing at Carthaginaes ſurpriſing. to defende and cleare Saint Luke, and I deeme it will not be hard to doe. For thus the caſe ſtandeth: The Septuagint adde vnto Moſes Perſones, fiue to Ioſeph (vnborne when Manaſſes and Ephraim were but

ſeauen or eight yeares old, at Iacobs comming to Egypt) a ſonne and a grandechilde to Manaſſes, Machir and Gilead: to Ephraim two ſonnes, Sutelah and Tahan: with Sutelahs ſonne Eden: all theſe, fiue: & accordingly doe they ſumme all, to be ſeauentie fiue ſoules. Great reaſons moued them: which fewe wordes can not make plaine. Saint Luke writing in Greeke was to followe the Greeke: though Saint Stephen ſpake as the Ebrew ſtood. And the Arabique tranſlatour, that folowed the Ebrew in a neare language, which ſhould be conferd with the Ebrew, not with the Greeke in Gen. 46. ſhewed a profound iudgement:A phraſe Act. 13. true in 450. whiche properly is but 339 and lappeth al one book and 19. places in one ſumme. regarding as St Luke did, nations weakenes, whereof vnto this day fewe knowe Saint Lukes minde, though it be not darke, if wee had looked vnto the Septuaginta. Like vnto Saint Stephens abridgement of old large ſtories commeth Paules oration Act. 13. where he reckoneth the nineteene Iudges, thirtene defendours, ſix offenders, all their times, as they in troubles ruled and dated two at once, yeeres after a ſorte foure hundreth and fiftie. So it is moſt exactlie after Saint Paules ſort of reckoning: and ſo Ioſephus reckoneth the Iudges yeares: when for the 480. 1. King. 6.1. he maketh 592. yeares. Here the Rhemiſtes marre the text: and the whole narration: neither bewe faultles, who for yeres but 339. propre, ſay about 450. the hundreth and eleuen of the oppreſſours nothinge 
                  •
               ugmented the worldes age: therfore in proprietie 450. can not be ſayde: about 450. and in a kinde of ſpeach it was exactlie ſo, and not about 450. And theſe examples may bee ſufficient to ſhew a Tranſlators care for defence of the text. Many are ready frō both Teſtaments. One kinde I cannot paſſe ouer, which Daniel hath in two examples:The Maſſorites onelye kept Daniels copy pure: twiſe in Dan. 7. and 8. where but for the Maſſorites Bible, the common copies would cōtinue errour. Daniel turneth the notation of a Chaldean kinges name and his owne Chaldean name, into cleane contrarie ſignifications, by tranſpoſing one vnſounded letter: Bel is

the authour of wealth: and Bel is a fyre of ſorrowe theſe are cleane contrarie, as darknes and light: ſinne & iuſtice: idols and the throne of God. The like is in Daniels Chaldean name: which breaketh out a fyer of ſorrowe, from Gods fierie throne againſt ſuch as held Bel a protectour of ſtore & treaſure: Vnleſſe we ioyne both the Great Venetians Bibles, none printed will here giue a Tranſlator that which he muſt performe, right writing for notation: in the former name. But in Daniels Chaldy name the text in Plantines Bible is ſyncere: marking the difference of it Cha. 1. and Chap. 10. And this poinct onely being ſo full of wiſedome in Daniel, ſhould mooue anie wiſe nation to peruſe their tranſlation, though it had no other imperfectiō. Thē matter is a pearle, and an holy thing: where hogges and dogges ſhall ſee no peace of the heauenly Ieruſalem: and ſuch as cōtemne this matter wilbe no better in Daniels eyes: whoſe rare commendation from men, and Gabriel is for vs, not for him ſelfe.
            
               2. Care: that the Tranſlatour brede not a lye.The next labour to this, no better obſerued of vs, ſhould beware making vntruethes in turning the Bible into our tongue. The like harme cometh by notes that would make the world falſe. I would that examples of leſſe plentie were in this kinde: though their ſtore may ſtirre to cure the ſoare. And firſt for no leſſe then the third part of the worlde,Sem falſelie tranſlated the Elder brother to Iapheth. touching Iapheth our Father, we ſtayne his birth-right: when our tranſlatiō maketh him yonger thē 
               Sem, Gē. 10.21. where Sem ſhould be brother to Iapheth the eldeſt. The record of yeares, the ſituation of the wordes, the Greekes vniuerſall conſent vnaltered in any of their tranſlations knowen, the preualent conſent of Ebrewes, for the moſt that way, & noted in Chimehi the king of Grammarians in Gadal, the cuſtome that God preferreth not the Eldeſt to be Chriſt his father: theſe and ſuch things ſhould haue cauſed to lothe not to folowe the vulgar Latin. For as a dead flye putrifieth

a boxe of precious oinctment, ſo one ſuch overſighte doth vnto an whole booke, and is a thorne to the ſide and eyen. An other thorne pricking the hart of good Ioſephs fame, is in Gen. 44.5. by not marking the plaine & exact proprietie of the Ebrew, touching Ioſephs ſiluer cup. Is not that it,
               Sēſible wiſe ſpeaches turned to witchcraft or extreme folly. 
               in which my Lord drinketh: and for which he would ſearch throughlie. So the wordes in their firſt ſignification meane: ſo olde Onkelos tooke them: ſo the ſence is ſenſible. And again in Ioſephs ſpeach the ſame is alike: Know you not that a man as I, can ſearch throughly? But we haue in our beſt: Is not that the cup in which my Lord drinketh, and for which he conſulteth with prophecies: or, in which he prophecieth. And what man would euer ſpeake ſo ſenſeleſſe. There the note goeth thus: He went not to the coniurers for any matter: but this is ſayde by diſſimulation, to increaſe the crime. So verſ. 15.

Nowe they that would looth blottes in a fayre picture, ſhould much more loth blottes and wrinkles which our drowſines bringeth vpon the ſtorie, whiche the ſpirit of Grace hath penned in moſt heauenly beautie and facilitie, as of purpoſe alluring all to looke on, and to ſtudie it: and to enter into the open porch of the Bibles temple. But we make an hedge of thornes to ſhut men out: whence we can not gather figges and reaſins: but many doe gather prickes to anoyance of ſuch as tender the ioyance of Religion.

Such thorny dealings muſt looke for that euent that Dauid in his laſt ſpeach tolde, That they may not bee touched, without iron or ſhafte of ſpeare: but beeinge as thornes muſt bee burnt in their place. The honny in the honny-combe, or the hidde Manna, will not ſoone bee founde in the Prophets languages, where the ſpeache is worſe then any Heathen would ſpeake. And theſe ſtaynes Geneſis had by vs: being whiter then anie ſnow in the originall, and a goodlier body of ſtory, then any Apelles pencill could painct for a fayre Lady. In Exodus one poinct hath longe troubled many: and at the laſt deceyued our Biſhoppes, to ſett in the argument a flatt vntrueth, whiche ſhould cut, as it were, all Moſes in pieces. And hardlie can a man finde anie parte of the Lawe, where an hiſtorique errour would more diſturbe. The place lyeth in Exod. 12.40 Theſe wordes we make to be the text: The dwellinge of the children of Iſrael, which they dwelt in Egypt, was foure hundred and thirtie yeares. The fault was not ours, but the Papiſtes, that brought it into honour: and ſome Greekes, at whom I marveyle: ſeeing the Septuaginta cleared the ſenſe by a large paraphraſe, and the moſt of their owne had gone aright. And yet the fault was ours, that in a matter of ſuch infinite helpes as be for the trueth herein of Ebrewes, Greekes, Latines, wee would daſh all Moſes authority: and that ſo manifeſtly, as to ſaye in the argument thus: They dwelt in Egypt foure hundred and thirty yeeres. Moſes knewe that his Ebrewes would thus vnderſtande him: The peregrination of the children of Iſrael, whiche ſoiourned in Egypt, was foure hundred and thirtie yeeres. The Lawe beinge ſpirituall, regarded Chriſt promiſed to Abraham, who therevppon left his countrey: which peregrination alwayes concerned Iſrael, and therefore is called The peregrination of the Children of Iſrael. Moſes teacheth in Cohath, who was with Iacob
               
and liued 133. yeeres, and his ſonne Amram, who liued 137. & his own 80. all 350. that Iſrael could not be 430. yeeres in Egypt.Genebrarde pieuiſhnes: who yet profeſſeth great Ebrew ſkil. Here Genebrard willing to defende the Latin rude tranſlation, ſayeth that Moſes might omitte ſome of his Anceſtours. He that ſpeaketh ſo, hath his conſcience burnt with an whot yron. What Ebrewe, Greeke or Latin, thought Moſes any further then the ſeauenth from Abraham, and to what end and purpoſe ſhould hee caſt all his Aunceſtours yeares vp to Adam, if hee omitted anie? Or howe could Iocebed his mother be Levies immediate daughter by our foure hundred and thirtie yeares? And ſo in our Lordes houſe: where Ezron came with Iacob: howe could Ezrom, Aram, Aminadab, and Naaſſon freſh at the comming from Egypt, drawe in ſucceſſion foure hundred and thirtie yeares? Thus, Saint Matthewe and Saint Luke for our Lords Fathers, with Ruth and firſt Chron. and Moſes in families infinite, ſhould be diſgraced. Againe, Saint Paul the Apoſtle of IESVS Chriſt, ſhould loſe his authoritie, who from Abrahams promeſſe of Chriſt elder then Circumciſion vnto the Law, maketh it but foure hundred and thirtie yeares. And that our owne Bibles note obſerueth vppon Geneſ. Chap. 15. very well. So it muſt needes be a great fault, to croſſe our ſelfes and all holy authoritie, and all the beſt of all ſortes, in ſo large a ſtorie, drawing infinite abſurdities vpon a ground of one.
            The Septuaginta expreſly telleth what peregrination of Iſrael was meant: euen theirs and their Fathers, repeating it,The 70. paraphraſinge for plaineſſe 
               Theirs and their Fathers in the lande of Chanaan and in Egypt. And this their doeing is euident in the Greeke tongue vnto this daye. Moreouer, both the Talmuds in Megilah recorde this their paraphraſe. Wherefore a tranſlation diſturbinge all, muſt not bee defended: howe ſo euer Genebrard and Adricomius bringe in theyr Chronicle all the

worldes age to this errour. Iewes would ſkoph ſuch Ebrewe profeſſours: that marke not howe fables are made of purpoſe vpon Moſes phraſes: that childrē ſhould better marke them. Thus a Rabbin is feined in the Talmud to reaſon afore great Alexander, againſt Egyptians complayninge that Iſrael robbed them & requiring reſtitution. The Rabbin obiecteth the text as an vnſkilful man would take it: the dwellinge of the children of Iſrael in Egypt ſervantes there was 430. yeares: and all their ſpoyles were little enough for ſo long ſeruice. This fable made for ſkil of phraſe wil make vs ſimple, if we be in deede babes. Now ſeeing Iſrael multiplying like fiſhe, had of 70. but about ſixe hundred thouſand ſtrong men, how could that be a miracle in 430. yeres ſpace. Abraham fought with many kings, about 430.

And furthermore this one thinge ſhould be ſufficient to vrge amendement, that none of our nation reade that, but are deceyued or grieued: and weakened in zeale to religiō.

Now that the good, of Bibles (which truly deſerue great cōmendation, though not of abſolute perfection) bee not in any parte hindered, which lightlie are not faultie but where Papiſtes erred before,Notes bely

Can one vndertake to tell a mans age, and put 130. yeares for 230. and not lye? And if Moſes omitted it, who knewe it? The teacher of Moſes was none other but hee which meaſureth the waters in his fiſt: peiſeth the heauens in his ſpāne, holdeth all the duſt of the earth in an half-pint: weigheth the moūtaines in a balance: and who could teach him, howe to haue inſtructed Moſes better in the waye of knowledge? When ſuch perverſe & crooked notes, diſannulling that which Gods letters ſpeaketh, come before our Bibles as a furtherance of the ſimple, what marveile is it, if blinde guides leade the blinde into the ditch?

An other Table of no leſſe poiſon pretending to reconcile Saint Matthew and Saint Luke, is prefixed to the newe Teſtament in our great Bibles: which I blamed in print ſharpely, and ſince it hath not bin printed: but thouſands enough to poiſon an whole nation, were ſolde afore. That table firſte denieth in effect ſix places where Achaziah is father properlie to Ioas: while it endeth Salomons houſe in Ioas: caſting downe ſix teſtimonies of him whoſe worde made all the frame of nature too

ſtande. That table would flee in a ſtorie that needes muſt ſpeake properly vnto a ſtraunge vſe of wordes: but comon reaſon ſhould haue taught, that a ſtrange kinde of ſpeach is not often vſed in one and the ſame matter: neither may it be vſed, but where the narration was cleared afore. Ezra, when he penned the Chronicles from the plain ſtory of the Kinges, vſeth termes in rare elegancie, and hard: but for the matters familiaritie; when he nameth the ſix & thirtie yeres Malcuth Aſa: when Aſa had not paſſed ſeauentene in reigne. Nowe Malcuth being kingdome or reigne, and the time agreeing with ſix and thirtie yeares from Iudahs kingdome, parted away from Ieroboams: the matter telleth what Ezra meaned: and his round ſumme from many particulars, in a narratiō knowne, had great clearenes. Whereas the kings ſtorie might not haue bene penned at the firſte ſo. Nowe, where in a carefull narration of longe diſcourſe, Ioas commeth ſonne to Achaziah, ſaued by Achaziahs ſiſter at an yere olde: and after a tyranny of ſixe yeares, at ſeauen, is made king: the denying of ſonages proprietie here is nothinge leſſe then to make a flat lye: and for ſix places of one tenour a ſixfold ſtumbling againſt the holy Ghoſt, who hath planted in mā a ſpirit that ſhould teach him knowledge: againſt which they that ſtriue, ſhalbe condemned of their owne harte.Ben vſed elegantly in a borrowed ſpech: Whiche the
                     •
                   that ſaw not, diſturbe by one errour all the holy ſtorie. In an other place Ezra vſeth Ben very elegantly. For it ſignifieth Sonne, or Belonging too: and that in great varietie. So Achaziah is Ben, a ſonne of twentie two yeares, when his father died at fourty. Nowe when Ezra, ſhewing how he came of Athaliah the daughter of Omry, properly daughter to Achab (but he nameth Omry, to call the reader to conſider his purpoſe for Omries kingdome: whoſe kingdome at Iorams death, ſtood fourtie two yeares, layd downe by manie parcels in the kings, & often Synarchies) when Ezra the learned ſhewing the troubles of all this kingdome, ſayth: He was Ben of fourty two yeares: the terme left his firſt ſignificatiō,

for his vſuall in a trope: Affected vnto: or Belonging vnto the famous two and forty yeares. This dealing in Ezra declared not onely his owne readineſſe in the ſtory, but alſo his nationes common readineſſe. They knewe well that Ezra could not haue from God any authoritie to check Gods former authoritie: nor yet to ſpeake any thing but that they might iudge off. And doubtles he would ſpeake as they at the firſt might allowe: and the blinde acquainted with the Scripture would not ſtumble. And ſo the ordinarie Commenter in Ebrew Ralbag playnneth all vpon this: Two and twentie yeares old was Achaziahu when he reigned: and one yeare raigned he in Ieruſalem: and his mothers name was Athaliahu the daughter of Amri king of Iſrael.
               Ben is ſonne or belōging vnto, or affected vnto, in ſundrie ſortes. Therevpon Ralbag writeth letters that ſpeake thus: 2. King. 8.16. Marke that 2. Chr. 22. it is ſaide: Ben of two and fourtie yeres. And marke that his count in the Chronicles was not of the birth of Achaziahu, but from the time of the ariſing of the kingdome of 
               Amri and Omri I doe vſe for the ſame: as he is tranſlated by A. & O▪
                
               Omri. And becauſe he was of 
                     •
                  is ſeede, it befell him that he was killed with the king of Iſrael. And thus goeth the ſumme: After thirtie and one yeare of Aſa, Omri raigned ouer all Iſraell: and raigned after that, ſixe yeres: and Achab his ſonne twentie two and Achaizahu two yeares: and Ioram 
                     •
                  ame to the twelueth. Beholde then the two and fourtie yeares of the kingdome of Achab. And for: His mothers name was Athaliahu the daughter of Amri: that ſheweth the reaſon of his phraſe. For ſhe 
                     •
                  as properlie the daughter of Achab. Thus the Rabbine ſheweth, howe Ezra expoundeth the Kinges ſtorie for Amries daughter, being properlie Achabs: leauing the propre time as vnmoveable as anie rocke: and for memory bringing many parcells to one ſumme. And therein muſt a Tranſlatour be ſo fullie ſettled where propertie can not be altered: as carefull, to allowe and followe the trueth of the Ebrewe copy. Pretēce of reconciling, breding endles variance, is moſt daū
                  gerous, againſt truth of holy ſtorie. And if the Lord tell ſix times, that Ioas the King was ſonne to Achaziah, tables pretēding to reconcile Saint Matthew & Saint Luke, breaking of Salomons houſe in Achaziahu:
               
and bringing Ioas to Nathan, though Europe embraced them, and our Bibles bare them in their harte afore the holy Goſpell, yet a ſounde Tranſlatour muſt loth them as a leproſie. How circumſpectlie we haue done herein, wee ſhould conſyder, to aboliſhe with publique authoritie, our ouerſightes and vnſkilfulnes, mother of lothing all religion. Many that finde vs rawe in matters of plaine ſtorie, the grounde of all, and ſett before our eyes, will leſſe thinke that, in matters of collection and plyable affection of argumentes, and things of the worlde to come, we ſhould be of any ſound iudgement. And Chriſtians ſhould not be as the Athenians, whom Demosthenes taunteth for being like doggs that bite the ſtone flong at them, and not the flinger: blaming not the authours of the fault, but the tellers what is committed.Dan. 12.

And Mine anſwere to thē will come anone.Iewes obiected vnto my ſelfe, for this forged table, our badnes, their gladnes, (for they knowe it full wel) that by our Euangeliſts none could proue that Chriſt came of Dauid. And they ſeeke no more to diſturbe all Chriſtianitie, then to haue Salathiel naturally Iechoniahs ſonne. For, then Chriſt muſt come of Salomon: and all Saint Lukes Goſpell, and, with all, Chriſtianitie fayled. And Chriſt ſhould come of the worſt that euer could bee: who commeth of none vnfaithfull. He ſhould come of Iehoiakim that burnt Gods worde, and killed a Prophete: of Manaſſes the ſawer of Eſai, of Achaz that fyered to Deuils

his owne children: of Amatziah, in religion an Edomite: and of Ioas, that killed Zachari, as Cain did Abel: of ſuch, the ſhame of the worlde, the King of glorie ſhould become king of the Iewes, the prayſe of GOD among men. Though we ſee howe careful God was to commend Rahab in the olde and newe:The ſuſpected in dignity haue glory from God: that Chriſts liue ſhould bee holden to haue none baſe. leaſt her yong lyfe ſhould ſtayne the

If we know not when a writer muſt ſpeak pro pre, or be counted a lier: and when wordes may bee taken in freer vſe, to great grace, we haue not ſettled our groundes of ſtudie, for tranſlating. The firſt penner of the matter and all writers of it muſt vſe all certen and ſure plainnes, vntill all doubtes be remoued. And ſo the Kings ſtorie is moſt exact: The abridgers grace ſtandeth in ſhort ſpeache: with cloſe helpes to call vnto the larger declaration. When Aggei and Zacharie had cleared Ieremies prophecie, that Zorobabel, who fanned Babels golden head was not of Iechoniah, but of Nathan Dauids ſonne, then Ezra more freely bringeth in ſpeach of the kingdomes right, Zorobabel to be Iechoniahs ſonne: but with two cloſe warninges: for firſt he maketh the Vncle Zedekias, ſonne: as folowing in the kingdome: at Iechoniahs removing: next, he ſheweth howe Iechoniah was ſtrait-priſoner, aſſyr: when he made Salathiel his ſonne. And ſo the Thalmud taketh aſſyr, in Sanedrin, for an adiectiue, bound, kept vp, and harde kept. And Seder Olam Zuta telleth in Catalogue of Iechoniah for ſonage and fatherwood: Dibberu Abothenu:
               A ſingular graunt of Iewes for S. Math. cha 1 our Fathers did ſpeake ſo. And here the force of trueth is mighty. The Rabbines knowe, that if their people knewe Solomons houſe to be ended, their hope of a Pompous kingdome were gone. Therfore they make this one of the articles of their faith: To deny that Meſſias cometh of Salomon: is euen to denye God and ſo all his holy prophetes. And to Ieremy they ſay: That Iechoniahs repētance altered Gods oath. But they haue a ſure true rule, that Moſes

owne repentance could not alter Gods ſentence pronounced for an outward puniſhment. Moreouer, his thirty 
                  •

ſtrangely kept, and Athalia reigned: that after ſix ſeauens of Calamities in Omri, & that kingdome ended: Iudah ſhould begin their ſtirres in the ſeauenth ſeauē, & hold it throughlie: when ſuch a wicked broode of Iezabel reigned in Iuda, that God killed three: Leproſed the next: plagued the people & Kinges ſtocke: left the good K. Ezekias longe ſonneleſſe, ſhewing how vnwilling he was to continue the kingdome: left Manaſſe to ſhed blood, calling (as Abels) for Babylon-puniſhment, and for ſome taſt, carieth the King thither: killeth Amon, & telleth Ioſias plainly of captiuitie: and by Sophonie of paying his ſonnes: priſoneth Ioachaz, giueth Ioakim the burial of an aſſe: captiueth and blindeth Sedekias, killeth his children: ſweareth that Iechonias ſhall dye childleſſe: biddeth all the earth, the earth, the earth to marke it: that none ſhould think Chriſt the king of glorie, to deſcend after the fleſh of Iezabel. Al theſe miſchiefes the Iewes knew and conſydered full well: that the two and fourtie yeares was moſt famous among them: that to be called a Babe of that two and fourtie yeares was to be noted as moſt openly curſed from (as we ſaye) his mothers belly: and if that had bene cōſydered, Ezra had bene cleared: and the curſe vpon the later Kings weighed: neither would men euer haue bin ſo ſenſeleſſe, as to haue brought in Nathans houſe, the holy ſeede at the firſt to be plagued, in the firſt yeare of coming to the kingdome, yea and the firſt yeare of comminge into the world. For they that make Ioas to bee of Nathan, muſt graunt that abſurditie alſo. If the ſwift Scribes readines had bred in vs heedineſſe, al theſe calamities had not made Iews triumph in diſputation (where myne eyes and eares were ten witneſſes) that by our Euangeliſtes we could not proue that Chriſt came of Dauid: If Ezra had bene marked Ieremie for Chonias had bene marked:

mine owne nation more: and thinke my time ſpent this way not the leſſer: to weigh Ebrewes with the Greeks, vntill both agreed vpon a trueth ſenſible to euery harte. For the ſtory of Kinges, all their chayne of ſtorie, I muſt differ. Firſt for the chayne of Iudahs kingdome: in Ezechiels thrie hundreth ninty years: therevpon for twentie two years of Anarchy in Iſrael: which are ſwallowed vp: and thervpon foure & twentie in the time of Azariahs reigne: and therevpon for Amatziahs reigne: whereof he would haue full eleuen years ſpent in baniſhment: and therevpon the ſwalowing vp of eleuen yeres Anarchy which in trueth ſhould be betwixt Amaziahs death and Azariahs reigne: and thervpon: ſeeing he maketh Azariah eight and twentie yeere a lepre: & Iotham raigneth after his fathers death in the ſeconde of Pekach: being but fiue and twentie yeares old, & rayneth but ſixteene yeres: he twiſe wreſteth the text further then natiue light wil ſuffer. In the ſame tenour we, & the French folowing him, muſt wreſtle: whether we ſaye better for Oſee that he preached ſeauentie yeares, or they, for fiftie yeares. The ſimple muſt be taught whether is deceyued, otherwiſe they wil caſt off both. So for the ſinne of Iſrael: in Ezechi. 4. whether Ieroboams calues, or ſomewhat in Salomons 27. be meant. And herevpon all the autoritie of the ſecond of the Chronicles: howe natiue iudgement can defende it in his ſenſe: and likewiſe whether he ouerthrowe not Ezra, Nehemiah, Eſter, Aggei, Zachari, and puts Daniels ſeauens to a plunge, and Mat. 1. and this propoſition: God hath recorded the worlds age frō the creation to the redemption. Hitherto the Chayne of Iubilees will belonge: and ſuch other matters as will folloe in their ſequel. Theſe poinctes muſt needes be named: leaſt fame of ſtraungers drawe vs hereafter to denie our owne good, as it hath done heretofore: into all the former errours:

that hereafter we may looke to trueth and auncient warrāt, ſtronger then any late profeſſours, & examē it before our people be troubled with any new editiō: in which euery one, who wil, ſhould haue ful ſpeach: for all poincts of doubt. Thus I blame this worke, for novationes not his owne.The harme of theſe errours. For bad Iewes invented all this diſturbance of very malice: to breake of the fiue chaines whiche drawe from Adams fal vnto our Lords reſurrectiō: which where they are knowē of Chriſt alſo confeſſed. Which though I haue made famous already, yet I think it not tedious, to handle them often. For they are a greater ornament to the necke, then anie chayne of Cethem, Paz, or any other the fineſt golde. The firſt reacheth all cleare, as the ſunne,Fiue chaines drawe from Adams fal to our Lordes reſurrectiō: For which a digreſsion here may do good: that none bee ſo hardy as to deſpiſe one worde, as it were a link, touchinge them, leaſt he be found guilty of diſgracing all. from the beginning of time to the death of Abrahams Father: the authour of idolatrie, in Chriſt his Line, and cauſe of ceaſſing the accompt for particular mens age in that tenour. The next beginneth vpō his death: with a new promiſe of Chriſt making Abraham heyre of the worlde. From that to the Lawe, Temple, and Salomons death, an other vndowſable is continued. His idolatry was worthy to haue that ended: for which his kingdome was parted, and Ieroboam did ſet vp calues for Gods: whiche doeing is commonlie called, The ſinne of Iſrael. Thē Iuda onely is Gods kingdome: and it for honour of Aſa is called the kingdome of Aſa. That is reckoned by compariſon of Iuda with Iſrael, in the kings booke: by Iuda onely in the Chronicles. And by one ſumme in the fourth of Ezechiel: from the ſinne of Iſrael vnto an end,The ſinne of Iſraell, Ezek. 4. where fourtie yeares alſo for an other matter famous, then in action, is full concluded. The preaching of Ieremie in playnnes, dignitie and fame, doeth make fourtie yeares from his beginning in the thirteeth yere of Ioſias vnto the end of the kingdome, & ruine of Citie, and Flames of Temple, & the Arkes deſtruction. The golden Candleſticke with his ſeauen ſtalkes, twoo &

twētie bowles, eleven Knoppes, nine Flowres, that goodlie worke of Bezeleel: that reaſted in the ſhadowe of God, then it was burſt:Chyram the Father of Salomon, was not the braſ worker, but Chyram the king, whoſe daughter Salomō had amōg his 700 as their familiaritie argueth, and Greekes in Euſeb▪ note. then all Moſes Curtines, and all that Chyram the kinges of Tyre, the Father of Salomon, & Chyram the Tyrian artificer, made to Salomon: the one by procuration, the other by trade, all theſe goodlie thinges left the Temple: & ſhewed Chriſt his wrath. Then Sedekias loſt his eyes, that neuer would ſee: Thē 
               Saraias, father to Ezra, was killed for badnes in high ſacrificehood: the death of whom being in recorde, killeth all comon receyued greke accomptes, thence to great Alexander, by Ezra one man liuing thither: then Sedekias children were killed, the only hope of Salomons ſtocke. And this was a famous marke to ende the third chayne vpon ſuch a famous puniſhment of idolatrie, and end of Moſes ceremonies, poore elementes in deed, that Chriſt from Ezekiels viſion full of eyes, might appeare in the ambre light and purenes. This marke was a goodlie piller, at which the thirde chayn might be faſtened:Four helpes are for the Kings times as the kingdome of Aſa beginning was a piller for the other ende. Such famous markes the holy ſtyle ſhoteth at: hauing a fourefold ſtring to the bowe: Iuda, Iſrael, both in parcells, Iuda ſole, and one totall ſumme. Which chaine if a Tranſlatour breake, as Ralbag, Iarchi, Seder Olam, and others malicious doe: ſtealing linkes nowe from the one, nowe from the other,The 390. Eze. 4. muſt be loked vnto in all particulars. he will foure times diſturbe all the kinge ſtorie and Ezekiel: and ſhall roove at ſuch dimme markes, for beginning, and ending Ezekiels three hundred and nientie yeares: as neuer can argue any golden chaine to drawe the world vnto Chriſt: but be worſe then a cankred wier one, of linkes all broken aſunder.

This ſtanding thus, I truſt euery man of harte will require in a tranſlatour much care and ſkil for euery one of thoſe linkes; no leſſe then faith and ſkill in a goldſmith: yea and ſo much more as the matter is more precious: though not a ſmall number ſhewe, that they would rather haue the trueth of God to periſh, then former ignorance detected. But ſuch muſt be vtterly cōtemned with as good ſtomaches as they bring. The Iudge that ſitteth vpon the fierie throne can, as all men knowe,Al truly lerned ioy to haue theyr paynes amended. and wil, as Moſes telleth, pay them home, when their foote ſhall fall. And I hope all learned will ioy to haue their good & learned paynes bettered: and ſcoured from that ruſt, whiche otherwiſe would cankre the whole. Now I wil returne to touche the worke I ſpeake of, as I ſhewd what Rabbines deceyued it: who to a bad ende of purpoſe, in their owne counſell, this did ſpeake againſt their cōſcience. The obſeruing of theſe matters will breede plentie of dexteritie in the ſtory of the Kings: which, ſome Ebrews thinke that Ierem. penned: as Ezra the Chr. In ſumme, this much I thinke of that learned Latin work and of the late French edition which foloweth it: that in the obſeruationes much iniurie is done to the trueth of ſtory. Examples may theſe be taken. Amazias raigned at Ieruſalem nine and twentie yeares, ſayeth the text. The notes checke it, that he raigned but ſeauenteene yeres, and liued at Lachis, banniſhed all the reſt. Amazias was killed, and when his ſonne was ſixteene yeares old, the people of the lande made him king. The notes make him reigne all the time of his fathers baniſhment. The text telleth, that he began to reigne in the ſeauen & twentieth of Ieroboam:
               
that he was then ſixteene yeares olde: and ſo he ſhould be about foure at his fathers death: & a regentſhip of eleauen yeares ſhould goe betwixt. The notes make him raigne foure & twentie yeares afore that time: that is eight yeres afore he was borne. The text maketh him reigne two and fiftie frō 
               Ieroboams ſeauen & twentie. The notes make him then ſtroken with a leproſy & to continue eight & twentie yeares. The text teacheth that Iotham, at his fathers death, was but fiue & twentie yeares old. So, by the former note, he ſhould iudge the people afore he was born, three yeres. The notes, to auoyd that, expounde the text thus: Hee was fiue and twentie yeares olde when he reigned, that is, when he ruled the kingdome in his fathers leproſie: and he raigned ſixteene yeres: that is, after his fathers death. If this had bene done in myne owne nation, I would haue blamed it more largely: But I loth to diſgrace a learned paynes, but for infinite neceſſity. And our trauels might haue more cleared the regentſhip of Azarias and the two and twentie yeares of Anarchy: that earthquake of the ſtate, and the ſtyrres called Iezreel: and likewiſe for Ezekiels 390. yeares, where the French notes returne to the right trueth: againſt their owne particulars in all theſe errours, wee in a fewe wordes might haue kept our nation from liking ſtrange opinions. Other matters of this Latin worke for the laſt Prophetes times & Zorobabels houſe, I haue written, againſt his learned defendor therin: though not here. D.R. whom I name for honors ſake. He deſerued great cōmendation for hazarding his fame: whether 2000. yeares errours holden almoſt generally ouer all Greekes and Latines Libraries, could be ſet on flame with a fire of iudgement taken from the holy authour. And, I trow, all of hart and our language, will confeſſe that parte cleared, by my paynes: how ſo euer ſome feared to ſtande to an arbitrement: reported that they had paſſed, as learning

would require them and all to determine. Yet hearing what infinite millions were againſt me: they thought it the ſafeſt way to haue all in ſuſpenſe. But I thought it a duetie vnto God and my countrey, to cleare not only the cauſe, but all the Bible, by Gods helpe, in our tongue: and to ſeeke for the next kingdomes helpe, if that labour at home ſhould be blaſphemed. Experiēce in Daniel the hardeſt booke, cleared (I hope) in the very dedication, may ſhewe how ſoone and eaſilie, much holden paſt hope of achieving, may be accompliſhed. And now to leaue ſtrangers, I will returne to our owne vpon Daniel: where I blame our paynes, that while we make two Nebuchadnezars: and miſſe of the Images time, and fourth Monarchy, and ill tranſlate Gabriels oration for redemption: and in our argument, Cha. 12. taxe Daniel for obſcuritie: who hath the greatſt plaines that euer the matter could ſuffer: While this runneth currant, all the Bible wil cōplaine that we doe exceedingly darken it.It his better antiquiry were diſgraced for miſsing thē the trueth of Daniel ſhould bee hid. Neither doe I thinke it better to haue the trueth of Daniel hid, then antiquity diſgraced for miſſing. But nowe I haue diſcourſed more largely of my two firſt poinctes: then I well may vppon all the ſixe following: howe heede muſt be taken, leaſt the Ebrewe writt or Greeke of the newe Teſtament bee blamed: and leaſt in tranſlation or expoſition the holy booke be peſtered thorough vs, with vntruethes: or haue anie one at all. One errour more I would haue ſpoken off, for a place of Daniel ill tranſlated: but it is to great to bee opened vnto the people: leaſt they want ſtay in moderation. I did obiect it with ſharpnes not the leaſt vnto a ſcholer of high place, and great recompence for his ſtudie: who tooke it in good part, and ſage moderation. And ſo I truſt hee will take all the reſt. Such affection will cauſe him ſelfe and others, ſome great reaſt, which little medling bredeth.

               12. As cōcerning the other beaſtes, they had their dominion taken away, but their liues were prolonged for a certen time and ſeaſon. This ſpeach vnſpeaketh it ſelf. For the beaſt is the Empire: and when the Empire is gone, the beaſt is no more a beaſt, but ſtādeth on his feete, as a man: when a priuate mans heart is giuen him: as in ver. 4. of ch. 7. Agamemnons man in Euripides beholding the Emperour writing for Iphigenia his daughter, to come to bee ſacrificed, and by fatherly affection blotting: & againe writing: and againe razing: marveyleth at his croſſe dealing.

                more marveylous: no naturall affection here caried, but vnacquaintance with Daniel and with the Ebrew tongue. And reaſon might tell that the ſpeach croſſeth it ſelfe. And herein I muſt commende my L. of Canterburies grace: who though he thought it not an officers parte, to admitte ſoone a new tranſlation: and when I had preſented vnto him ſelfe and his patronage the ſeauen firſt chapters, all the Chaldy part, and the firſt chapter with ſomewhat more about it: he wrote in deed to ſtay the worke: yet whē I debated what his place required him to doe, he wrote againe to licence the worke: his grace ſaying, that he would not defend it: I ſhould ſtand to the defence of it. And full readie am I to doe that. And I dare defend his

grace for that tranſlation: that it is bettea then the vſuall in the Church. And whereas a certen Printer feared, leaſt in time it would come into the Bibles, he needes no more to feare, then leaſt in time our nation will cōmonly learne Daniel in one houre: which without an heyfer, that manie pricke, will not ſo ſoone be cleare: and was long ſealed vp in our nation. Full is the Prophet of examples, biddinge heedines, but finding headdines. And Moſes had the like occaſion, as he liued, when ſkant any in the world belee

vs Sheol, that is, The verbe, the root of it is Shaal. to require and Scheol is the ſtate which euery life with ſenſe payeth, as a debt: when it is ſpoken of a body, whether of man or beaſt, as in the companie of Coreh, Dathan, Abyram, the deſtruction from this life is meant. If ſequell of matter bring more, by the matter, not by the word, it muſt be admitted. In mens caſe we terme it commonly the graue: though fiſhe in Sea, or fier in earth, or Hyrcanyan dogges panches, or Egyptian Glaſſes, were their tombe: or they were, as Iakym, that with his penknife did cut Ieremies lamentations, caſt away as the buriall of aſhe: fit for ſuch as hate ſuch diligēce about Gods worde, as by Ieremies example wee may ſee, that the Eternall doeth require. That ſtate to the body is Scheol: to the ſoule, the loſſe of this worlde in ſuch as knew not the ſoules immortalitie is Sheol: to mē of further reach: the world of the Soules: the worlde vnſeene of vs that be here: without diſtinction of lotts there. For fewe knewe that: the hidden of God called in Ebrewe, pſal. Cxi, Sod, the myſterie of righteouſnes. And they the Lillies among thornes ſpake as the common worlde: and commonlie of the ſoule by termes fit for the body, for ſuch as graunted no further continuance, & for ſuch as graunted that there was an other world. And as dying is holden a degree lower then life: and daily ſpeach ought to be ſuch, as the greater part be not troubled with it, to deſcende to Scheol is to leaue this world. So Iacob would deſcende to Scheol vnto Ioſeph: ſo Iudah feared to bring his fathers graynes to Schecol with ſorrowe: ſo Gods anger in Deut. 32. and in the ſame ſyllables in Ieremie, ſpeaking of Ieruſalems fall, is a fyer that burneth vnto the low Scheol. Not determininge of their ſoules: though their caſe were daungerous in warres brought for idolatrie: men dying in contempt of the couenant. The argument might determine: the terme did

not determine. Haides in the Greeke is the very ſame: and neither of them is euer in Scripture, directlie the ſtate of Eternall torment: but as king Ezechias deſcribeth it: The

vnto God, how to vnſpeakeable extremitie his tormentes went on: Why O my God doeſt thou forſake me! The phraſes of both, the firſt from Pſal. 42. the verſe repeated Pſa. 43. (for the Greeke of it is the Greeke of the newe Teſtament) the next from Pſal. 22. theſe two be the ſaddeſt phraſes of the language. And we muſt thinke, that as much is vnder them as can be conteyned: for the ſuffringes of our Lorde, and that he ſpake of his owne perſon. But I am not nowe to runne into a common place: if any ſtirre be of late riſen, that way, men of preferrment for their paynes, muſt looke to the defence of the trueth. And it is iniurious to require anie to warre on their owne charges: as ſome haue requeſted me to deale herein. But for a Tranſlatour, he muſt be careful in ſuch poinctes: where for the maner of the world the Scripture hath termes generall, that the vnlearned in tongue, and the vnſtayed in the groundes, wil turne often times into a wrong ſenſe. In this ſorte the terme, Hell, thorough the olde Teſtament, ſhould be well looked. He that thinketh it euer vſed for Tartaro or Gehenna, otherwiſe thē the tearme Death may by Synecdoche importe ſo: hath not ſkill in Ebrewe or that Greeke, which breathing and liue Graecia ſpake: if God hath lent me any iudgement that way. And who ſo euer can not cleare the Apoſtles words by men indifferent: as Old Greeks, Rabbines, & ſuch like is vnſetled in his ſtudy. Saint Peters place in his firſt Epiſtle and thirde Chapter affoordeth a good example for heede in places harde.My 3. place of 8. is of ſpeaches harde of them ſelues: not of made ſo by vs, as 1. Pet. 3. Though it belong not properlie to this parte which I handle. For he ſpake ſo plaine, that anie Iewe then, or yet aliue, would vnderſtand him. And thus he ſhould be trāſlated: Chriſt ſuffred, &c. being made dead in the fleaſh, made aliue by the Spirite, in which ſpirit he had gone & preached

to them that now are ſpirites in priſon: becauſe they diſobeyed when the time was: when the pacience of God once wayted in the dayes of Noe. I aſſure my ſelfe that there is not anie learned Iewe in the world, nor was, ſince Saint Peters time, but would thus vnderſtād him. For all theſe poinctes are plain with them: the Spirit of God, Gen. 1.2. Ze Ruho Shel Melech Ha Maſhiah· This is the Spirit of Maſsiah the King. So, the ſpirit of God that preached to Noe, ſhould be that ſpirit of Chriſt, whō Saint Peter in expoūding his minde, calleth God, whoſe patience wayted.

for euer all that be out from the couenant: ſeeing all this matter is true, & the proprietie of Saint Peters wordes in their moſt exacteneſſe, will abide this: and the Iewes, to whoſe natiō he wrote, admitted all this: and neuer would admit anie other meaning of theſe his wordes: which for matters in viſible, muſt be plaine and in graunted ſenſes: A learned Tranſlatour, who from childhoode ſhould be acquainted with the holy Ebrewe & Greeke: and for it with all writers for both tongues, ſuch a Tranſlatour would be better then many cōmenters. Saint Peter would acquaint his nation, that the Spirit of Chriſt was in the Prophetes, whom they called Iehovah. And in a matter of ſo great weight, to tranſlate ſo that the humane ſoule of Chriſte ſhould nowe be meant ſpirit: and that to bee made aliue, which dye can not, and to take a iourney vnrecorded in the penners of the Goſpell: and to preach among ſoules, gon hence & to Noes age peculiar: as hauing diſobeyed once: but after as better aduiſed: If Saint Peter had anie ſuch meaning in glaunſes vndiſputed out: the ſcattered Iewes, who admit no doctrine but taught in Moſes & the Prophetes; they would haue reiected all the Apoſtles autoritie. But in this place we make cloudes: he bred none. And in our cloudes we might ſooner enable Iob to bring about all propounded by God, as aboue his reach: as defende Saint Peter againſt anie Iewe: which thing he that can not doe, is but a raw Doctor of the newe Teſtament. A man might as ſoone tell vpon what foūdation the earth was layde: what meaſure it hath: how the Sea was ſhutt with dores: howe it is ſwadeled with the darke: howe to giue the morning his charge, and to ſhewe the day ſpring his place: yea and may as ſoone open the gates of death and ſee the dores of the ſhadowe of death: as tell howe Chriſtes humane ſoule could dye, and be made aliue: and

what ſermon he ſhould make enioyned from Moſes & Elias doctrine: or why peculiarlie to men of the fludds age: or defende cōſtantlie any ſuch thing, at all, done by Chriſtes humane ſoule: of any conference or ſpeach among the dead. And Saint Peter knewe that Moſes commaunded to leaue the hid things to Iehovah our God: and knew that our Lorde him ſelfe neuer taught his Diſciples to breake that: and might not breede leappers ouer the threſhell. And for this very poinct of our affirming that Chriſt went to Gehennah, the Iewe Iſaak Ben Arama, who writeth ful excellent things for Chriſtianitie in Shaar 52. vpon Exod. and ſheweth that all his nation ſince Ieruſalem fel, haue miſtaken all the Prophetes: and is cited for our ſide by Munſter and Nebienſis vpon Pſa. 110. he diſputing vpon Leuit. 26. for the end of the Lawe, and howe all thoſe curſes might

ſpake and wrote) will defende, that any one ſyllable in ſcripture doth ſo much as euer glaunſe, that Chriſt deſcended to Gehenna. Here, & in ſuch poinctes a tranſlation bearing on the ſame page the original, Ebrew for the Olde,A tranſlatiō for trial propoūded vnto all to ſpeak againſt wher they could: ſhould haue the original wich it: and ſuch would alwayes be good for libraries and the learned. with all Maſſorites clearing of the text: & the Greeke for the Newe, with declaration from what kinde of writers euery member of ſentence is fetched, and made according to them by one that hath his eyes in his head, and the ſpirit of Elihu in Iob, ſuch a tranſlation in one word would calme all waues. The Aethyopian tranſlation may be an example vppon Saint Peters place, whiche hath for Spirit, Manphes Kades: the Spirit Holy. The plaine Aethyopians, among whom manie Iewes dwelt, ſhewe that they neuer ſtaggered there. By ſuch two wordes in a margent note, all ſtrife would ceaſe. So in the Pſalme 110. The Greekes tranſlated diuinely: From the wombe before the morning ſtarre haue I begotten thee. The Ebrewe was hard of purpoſe: and the Greeke Tranſlatours doe ſhewe their great diuinitie. I would herein follow them: either in the text, or lay them downe as paraphraſtes in the margent. For their authoritie for diuinitie is next the vndoubted Prophetes and Apoſtles. Though for their difference from the Ebrew, accented, vowelled, & ſounde in euerie piece of letter (ſo neare it muſt bee examined) millions of poinctes, which entangled vs, muſt bee conſydered. And now I haue handled largely three poinctes of eight: wherin we muſt confeſſe overſightes: whiche for a dry cauſie bring vs to quabbemyres: and we may not refuſe amendment: for feare, (as ſome haue ſpoken in effect) leaſt men will ſay: we had no way at all heretofore.

they be men that ſo ſpeake.

                marueill, why Tremelius hauing done well, was altered &

marred after his death. As likewiſe in Daniel 9.24. & 23. I could wiſhe him reſtored to his former goodnes. Nowe we vpon Gen. 4.26. ſay, Then men began to make invocation in the name of the Lorde. But Moſes expoundeth him ſelfe Ch. 6.1. (the Cha. 5. is but a parentheſis in the narration) and ſheweth when men began to bee multiplied, God ſawe that their malice was great. And that is the reaſon why our father Seth termed his ſonne Enoſh: Sorowfull. It had bene ſenſeleſſe to call him ſorrowfull: vpon calling on Gods name. Nowe the Prophetes call Man Enoſh: ſtill expounding the text. So that a corruption of it, greeueth all the reſt. An other example of this kinde I will bring from the newe Teſtament. Mary Magdalene had that affection towardes Chriſt, which euery full faithfull ſoule hath in the Canticles. When ſhe was a litle paſt the watchmen: ſhe founde him whom her ſoule loued: ſhee layde holde vpon him: as not willing to let him goe. Our Lord ſayeth, cleaue not to me: or faſten not ſo on me. I doe not yet preſently aſcend. The holy and wiſe Euangeliſt left out her action, to bee gathered by our Lorde his ſpeach. So Daniel omitted his hinderāce of The Chaldean Kinge is written ſeauen ſeuerall wayes in the Prophets, wherwith to acquaint our nation to knowe the Ebrew diligence variety is, not amiſſe.

And our Biſhops notes learnedlie ſhewe that.A commendatiō of the Biſhoppes notes. For thus they ſpeake, vpon Ioh. 20.17. Hereby Chriſt correcteth her carnal affection, looking too much to his bodily preſence, and therefore he pulled her from outward & externe offices, towardes his bodily preſence, and willed her to bee mindfull of his aſcention. The tranſlation of the text is ſenſeleſſe:A moſt ſenſleſſe ſpeach;

               Touche me not, for I am not yet aſcended vnto my Father. Euery linguiſt will cōfeſſe, that two groſſe faultes are here committed. For the Greeke Verbe of touching is ſuch, as timber workes faſtened touche: and is, To faſten vnto: to

be ioyned vnto. And ſo Saint Paul doeth vſe it, ſayinge: It is good for a man not to touche a woman: that is, not to bee faſtened by mariage as one. And ſo, Haphe, a ſubſtantiue of this verbe, is trāſlated, a ioint. Ephe. 4.16. This was a groſſe ouerſight: not to cleare the equiuocation. And ſome who haue a minde to Deſcend to Gehennah, and can not abide that Chriſtes ſoule ſhould goe to Paradiſe, as the theefe beleeued it ſhould: and as all Iewes would ſweare, his wordes ought to meane, haue cited this text againſt that:

Becauſe it was an Herculean labour at Augaeas ſtable to toyle in this part: I noted about three ſcore chapters of Eſay, Eccleſiaſtes, and others with lines what I blamed in this kinde: and ſent them to an whole nation to be looked vnto: and will here lay down an Epiſtle written afore vnto me from them by the conſent of their moſt Noble King, for that kinde of ſtudie which I felt paynefull & coſtly now thirtie yeares: though ſome of ours deſpiſe it: and for their reſolutiō to haue this worke to goe forward.

But I muſt returne to the foreſaid trāſlation: yet I muſt not hope to bringe in this kinde where all will runne in one ſorte, examples one of a thouſand, that I might: where the Prophetes

ſhort ſpeaches to ſtirre diligence, are by vs turned from Chriſt to Belial, from vertue to ſinne, frō the temple of God to peors religion: as, if thou hate her, put her away.

               Heare ô ye people, all they. The Ebrewes chaunge the pronownes ſodenly, now and thē: as the two Michahs doe, ô YEE, and all THEY. Nowe, the vſing of the ſame ſyllables, biddeth to looke vnto the ſame euent. Micha ſonne of Imlah proued true in Achab, and the fall of Iſrael for the time thē, though foure hundreth falſe prophetes thought and taught otherwiſe. So ſhould the Iewes thinke of Micha the Moraſthite, that his wordes would prooue equally true.It is a deap matter that only Abbakuk Aggei & Zacha y title them ſelues Prophetes. But to holde on: Abakuk entitleth him ſelfe a Prophete: Aggei and Zachary doe the ſame: none, I trow, but they three. The reaſons be weightie: And Daniel is a wonderfull gracious man for all thinges. And in noble ſort for this: for calling by one ſkilfull worde, whole ſtories to be compared togither. By the worde Tippaghem, was Troubled, vſed onely afore in Pharaohs ſpirite, placed again in Seauen wayes ſcripture writes his name: which to imitate none of grace wil forbid. 
               Nauocodroſors he calleth into minde: Pharaoh, his Chartummim, or coniurers, Ioſeph and infinite compariſons with Nauocodroſor, his Chartummim, and Daniel: yea the whole ſtories for both kingdomes are called into mynde by one worde, Be-hammered the worde properly ſignifieth. But how ſo euer it ſhould be tranſlated in the margent of the later from the firſt it ſhould be noted. So whē he prayſeth God, as dwelling in light that none can come too, which thing God handleth in Iob in ſpeaches reaching through the frame of nature, Daniel vſeth a phraſe vſed onely of God: Iadagh Binah: to knowe vnderſtanding: teachinge thereby howe he that will, may prooue true his ſaying of Gods wiſedome, from Gods owne declaration of it: a peculiar longe ſpeach vſed of purpoſe in that argument. So Mauz, the name of might and almighty vſed of Dauid,

Salomon, Eſai, Nahum, Ezekiel, with attribes commonly of rock, life, ſaluation, and ſuch. So in Daniel in the plurall number increſing the force. Maüzim, and the temple is called the ſanctuarie of Maüz, and fortes of Mauzim: wherein while the Seauentie hid their minde, an errour intollerable came in, in Dan. 11. which thus ſhould ſtand: As for the God Maüzim (that is almightie) in his place he ſhall worſhip,
               Se the common tranſlation. 
               yea a God ſhall he worſhip whom his fathers knewe not: and he ſhall cauſe the holdes or fortes of Maüzim to haue a ſtraunge God. Here the Angel comfortes the Iewes againſt Antiochus ſtrength, by the very name of God, twiſe laying attributes of the Temple to cleare the ſpeach. But I may not tary in Daniel, Nehemias repeateth that terme in honour of Daniel, & memorie of him. But of all, Ezra, is moſt herein, whoſe whole worke of the Chronicles is infinite much in the very ſyllables of the former: and when he changeth the phraſe, that change hath great vſe, and ſhould be marked in a tranſlation. Such is the newe Teſtament: whoſe firſt oration faſteneth to the laſt ſpeach of the olde. For Gabriel to Zacharie beginneth the newe Teſtament where the olde ended. And this ſhould haue made the Church to haue hid the 
                  •
               idde Apogrypha, according to their name: and neuer to 
                  •
               aue let them ſee the ſunne of the Church. They breake the chayne: and make monſtrous all the body of the Teſtament, abſolute without it: and not admitting any word of it: for lāguage to any one letter, nor to any wit in ſtyle, articles or ſtory. Infinite much of the newe teſtament might haue in the margent the Ebrew which it trāſlateth. As this: Grace and peace from God: Aarons bleſſing, & this:The newe Teſtament is almoſt all frō the olde. 
               God knoweth who be his: from Moſes ſpeach to Coreh: and God hath not forſaken his people. Be thou perfect as thy Father in heauen is perfect: from this, Thou ſhalt be perfect with the Lord thy God, and ſo infinitely. A Tranſlatour ſhould haue all this

in tables before him. So the Bible ſhould bee ſhorter for memorie by a quarter: when the minde ſhould ſee what was plaine afore, and is but repeated. And in facilitie ten times eaſier: ſhewing no newe matter to be in handlinge, but a commentarie of the old. Moſes ſong, Deut. 32. might be ſhewed al through in the Prophetes, Paul, Peter, Iude, & others. Howe we haue contemned all this: examples wee haue like the ſande of the ſea, that can not bee numbred. Two I could bring too haynous: eyther ouerturning, the one the maine of faith, in a Trāſlation: the other in a note caſting out the canonical with a Semicycle, as leſſe profitable, and drawing in Tobyes Legenda aurea, made as other Iewiſh, forbid fables, to breake all the frame and honor of Gods counſel: wherein we ſhewe that wee neuer knewe, howe the families guide the holy ſtory, in a moſt ſenſible dignitie: and what families might not excell the reſt, nor yet in any dignitie come neare the chiefe. And thus fiue partes of my eight are concluded.The ſixt care Facilitie of phraſe. Curioſitie an enemy to this poinct. In our ſixt care facilitie of phraſe defended by the newe Teſtament, the Septuagint, and writers old indifferent for all nations muſt bee had. Here ſtudentes in Ebrew miſſe by curioſitie: as when they ſay: He that beleeueth ſhall not haſten. The Septuagint knowing that haſtening to vnſtayed thoughtes in the mind, and colour of face argueth ſhame: ſayd ſhall not be aſhamed. Moſes ſayth: The day of their deſtructiō is neare: and the caſe of the things ready for them haſteneth. Saint Peter tranſlateth him moſt oratoriouſly: though changing his order: Their deſtruction ſumbleth not: and their iudgement of olde is not ſlowe. The holy Ghoſt his trāſlation here ſhould ſtande. Many ſuch places come where the ſtrict propriety is too harſh. As, If the iuſt haue his payement (that is doubtfull to the ſimple) in Greeke, is hardly ſaued: very learnedly. Ignorance herein caught of late two ſides of ſtriuers tardy,

about this: God called for darknes and it came, and they were not diſobedient vnto his worde. Therein ſome defend the Ebrew,Wher the 70 (to avoid an harſhphraſe) dealt as paraphraſtes, our vnreadineſſe cauſed Batrachomy

The Greekes altered the relation of diſobedience vnto the Egyptians thus: As they diſobeyed his worde. Herein we had a very vnſeaſonable ſtrife: with bitter contention, and extreme vnſkilfulnes in the offenders and defenders. The Greekes knew well what the Ebrewe had: but ſawe it harſh for the Greeke phraſe: and that made them departe from proprietie, as paraphraſtes may, retayning the ſenſe. And here I think it good to digreſſe a litle vnto the Septuagintaes ſtory, for great vſe of our preſent matter.Of the Septuagint: that all trāſlated not the ſam thing, but euery one his part, &c.

But very much they hid their minde▪ ſpecially for the worldes age betwixt Adam and Ahraham. There was no other tranſlation but theirs in the Apoſtles age: and it was more knowen to the Iewes then the Ebrewe, ended from daily vſe fiue hundreth yeares afore. Therefore they vſe it exceeding much. In many places they leaue it & tranſlate moſt oratoriouſlie.The Greke Teſtaments words 4600 are▪ the moſt part, from the Seauentie. It was often deceyued by miſtakinge Characters like: as, Daleth and Reſh, be: D. and V. Caph & Reſh: where the foot of Caph wanted Inke. In ſuch places, if the tranſlatours had borowed their neighbours copies, they had not miſſed. But they ſaw no reaſon of exact care, wher their labour was required only for a braue Librarie. Syracides that was a childe when they tranſlated, excuſeth the matter, how hard it was to trāſlate Ebrew into Greeke. Hard muſt it be for thos poor afflicted Iewes lothing Heathen, to affoord ſeauēty learned through all the Prophets Emblemes, Ebrew ſubtilties, and Greeke elegancy: where the Church neuer had ſeauētie, or I trow ſeauen that ſpent their life in Ebrew & Greeke for the explaning of the Bible.The church neuer had yet ſeauen that ſpent theyr life in vowelled Ebrew and Greke exact antiquity, for the Bibles vſe. Their tranſlation was turned into Arabique, though that tongue is almoſt Ebrew, and into the neare Ethiopiā: either becauſe they had not exact Ebricians, or thought it not ſafe to differ. The vulgar Latin, and all ours, ſauing the Geneva follow it. And this is the cauſe why ours come ſo much ſhort of the Ebrew. And the defendours mynde to feede on ackornes when corne is founde out.

And I thinke the BB.Why our Bb returned to followe the 70. rather then the exact, true vnfallible Ebrewe. reuiued the folowers of the vulgar Latin and the Greeke, leaſt our people ſhould bee too much amazed at the firſt, by the great diuerſitie.

Now to teach vs, that, The Syriaque hath Zimcha, Eſaies. When thouſands of theſe come in ſingular great matters, better then commentaries to lighten eyes: all togither will make a mountayne of golden learning, and haue great force.

Wherein the facilitie of the matter ſhould bee warranted for better ſatisfaction of all: by all of indifferent affections.

               rth in fayrer and more diſtinct letters: and they would each vndertake copyes to fiue poundes: both ten. Herevpon I cauſed M. Fr. Raphelengius, the beſt of Printers, to print me a thouſand: which I haue ſent to Englande, to make our Diuines readier in great matters. Maiſter Ioſeph. Scaliger, a Gentleman of rare learning, and Maiſter Raphelengius had neuer ſeene them before I ſent them to Leyden: Both as good Linguiſtes, as any in the world: and learned men: to whom I am very much beholding for ſingular gentlenes in lending me bookes rare and of rare commoditie: ſuch as our nation, I trowe, neuer yet ſawe. A certen Engliſh man here, had by my gyft but one copy, and was ſhewed the vſe of it: of whom I demaunded in ſadnes to record it in print, what he eſteemed of the matter: and he ſayd that of trueth, he would not for twentie poundes bee without the copye and the matter. The caſe ſtanding thus, I can not chuſe but be grieued to ſee my Ebrewe ſtudies ſo defaced, a good old worke and a rare monument, marred, & occaſiō offered to haue our natiō for learning much contemned. The certeintie of the holy text in Ebrew, is a matter, as all called to grace, will confeſſe to be gracious. And that rare piece of worke of Sadaias, will ſeeme, to all, voyde of Papiſtrie, and endued with reaſon, to confirme much the certeintie of Scripture. Wherfore proceeding from an enemie, for the trueth, & grounds of faith, the corrupting of it ſhould ſeeme a worke farre from grace. Beſides theſe verſes of Sadaias, a piece of the Ieruſalemy Talmud, very pleaſant and learned with Gentlemē learned in Ebrew, is corrupted in this Printers edition: whereas no open aduerſarie could ſo much diſgrace, as ſuch a corrupter of matters brought about not without great paynes, pretending reuerence to the authour. I haue felt griefe in this kinde alreadie not a litle: by a booke collected from ſundry fragmentes

by a ſeruingman: and falſely reported to be notes from me. As that booke was in printing, I did cauſe the ſeruingman to ſhewe your grace of it, that the Printer had no authour for his worke: and, as he tolde me, the Printer was bound in fiue hundred poundes not to proceede: but by a bribe, ventured againſt his band, and vpon complaint anſwere was returned, that the Printer would noyſe how he was vndone: So againſt all that I could doe, forged ware, ſome ſtollen from me, ſome from others, and more kindes then Labans ſheepes coloures, were ſolde deare in London, and Sturbridge fayre, and ſtill fathered vpon ſuch as moſt loth it. As all trueth ſhould be trueth: ſpeciallie in diuinitie it ſhould be ſo. And the befooling of an whole nation ſhould not be counted a light faulte: in forging authours, by pieuiſh printers, & greadie of vnhoneſt gaynes. I was minded neuer to haue printed anie thing. But forgers of matters to be as mine, which I lothed, they forced me to leaue in print the whole veyne of my iudgement in Diuinitie, in the booke of Scripture concent. That any might knowe myne from forged ware. Nowe at my firſt printing much anger I had. When it came furth: the great Lord Chauncelour tolde the Queene, as he bragged, that in no caſe any countenance might be ſhewed me: & thervpon a Noble Earle, who had named vnto me a fine recompence of my ſtudy, hearing of the L. Chauncelours ſpeach, altered. And I to pay the L. Chauncelour, mynded to haue liued in Germanie: till I heard the Queenes aunſwere: That he commended, whom he condemned. For that the booke was ſchollerlike & all for the States good: where to knowe howe to ouerreach others, & not to doe it, argueth a minde bent to quietnes. Another gaue out wordes alſo to the Queene: vnlearned and malicious: of whom I will yet ſpeake nothing. Your Grace I muſt now commend for much humanitie, that tolde one, ſent in my

cauſe: that whatſoeuer you could doe for me, you would: So that I would acknowledge my friends. In trueth my L. touching preferments I was thus minded hitherto: that if my worthier in the common eſtimation ſtept before me: I would reioyce. But when two hundreth thouſande poundes a yeere is ſpent by the Church vpon ſuch as can not reade a line of the Bible: and I could not liue in Englande vnſollicited ſtill to preach: and was commended by the Queene, whom I trowe you will not checke, I ſee not why I may not require my recompence: as the Realme hath put the Queene in truſt to deale: and require it with as good a conſcience, as you may receyue one pennie of your tenantes. You gaue me counſell to be toward ſome Biſhop or ſome Lord as one ſayde to whom it ſhould bee tolde. The Queene or a Prince ſhould bee the onely Patron for one of my yeares ſpent in hard ſtudies. And the Counteſſe of Warwicke tolde that the Queene would not for all the prefermentes in the Realme, I went out of the Realme. In the time of deliberation, I pray your Grace, that Printers be not allowed to diſgrace my ſtudies.
