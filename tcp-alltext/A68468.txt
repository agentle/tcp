L. maintaines her, ſhe maintaines a Knight, he maintaines a Whore, ſhee maintaines a captaine. So in like manner, the pocket keepes my boye, hee keepes me, I keepe her, ſhee keepes him, it runs like quick-ſiluer, from one to another; Sfoote I perceiue I haue beene the chiefe vpholder of this Gallant all this while; it appeares true, we that pay deereſt for our paſture are euer likely worſe-uſde, Sfoot he has a Nag can run for nothing, has his choiſe, nay and gets by the running of him;—oh fine world ſtrange deuills, and prety damnable affections.
