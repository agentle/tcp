BY RICHARD BEACON GENT. STVDENT OF GRAYES INNE, AND SOMEtimes her Maieſties Attorney of the province of Mounſter in Irelande.
            
            
               AT OXFORD, Printed by IOSEPH BARNES, Printer to the Vniverſitie. Anno Domini, 1594.
         
         
            
            
            TO HER MOST SACRED MAIESTIE.
            
            
               IF all the actes and monumentes of former ages, moſt mighty and renowned Queene, and Empreſſe, which might recommend this action of reformation vnto all poſterities, were committed to oblivion, yet the recordes and monumentes of your Maieſties moſt happy governement, may ſufficiently revive the ſame:The act of attainder of Shane Oneile, Ann. 11. Elizab. where it is ſaide, that your Highnes hath atchieved vnto that which is moſt rightly tearmed the greateſt magnificence of a Prince, which doth not onely conſiſt in high bloud, hauty progenie, aboundance of private riches and ſubſtance, wherewith your Maieſtie is every way plentifully adorned, but it reſteth chiefely in populous and wel governed regions, & in beautiful Cities and Townes; al which being impaired in your Realme of Ireland, by the iniquitie of former times, nowe as well the one as the other, by your Maieſties moſt godly and careful courſe of governement, are recontinued, amended, and augmented. What more? Have you not reformed all exactions grievous

vnto that people? Have you not reformed that horrible and moſt deteſtable cuſtome of Coiney and Livery, that fretter of the peoples lives and ſubſtaunce, that Nurſe and teate which ſometimes gave ſucke and nutriment vnto all diſobedience, rebellions, enormities, vices and iniquities of that Realme, over foule and filthie heere to bee expreſſed? Have you not in place of ſorrow, famine, howling, and curſing, brought ioy, iolitie, plentie, and every where bleſſings of ſo gratious a Queene? Have you not reformed that daungerous cuſtome of Captaineſhippe, which by factions did diſmember the ſtate of Irelande?Anno. 11. Eliz. cap. 7. fo. 168.
                for all which if wee ſhould bee founde vnthankefull, yet the ſtatutes and recordes of that lande, would witnes the ſame againſt vs. Great is the honour which is due vnto Robert Fitz Stevens, which firſt opened the waie of Irelande to the Earle of Stranguile: and great is the honour due vnto the Earle, which opened the ſame vnto Henry the King: & great is the honor which is due vnto the King, which opened the way vnto Iohn his Sonne greatly is he to bee praiſed, that firſt ſo boldlie began; and woorthy of greater praiſe is he, that after the beginning ſo nobly came to execute

the thing ſo well begun; but moſt of all he is to be praiſed, that ſhall perfect and finiſh the ſame; which praiſe by Gods divine providēce is light on your Maieſtie;Anno. 11. Elizab. for ſo the ſubiect of Irelande in the act of Attainder of Shane Oneile doeth liberallie confeſſe: therefore goe forwarde Brutus, for thy glory in reforming, is farre greater then the glory of Romulus in building and inſtituting of the citie of Rome. All nations with the Romaines ſhall honour your preſence, as another Time-ſitheus, for reforming and reſtraining the Lyparians from their accuſtomed robberies and ſpoiles; all nations ſhall rightly honour you with the Ladies of Rome, which ſometimes offered their iewels to be ſolde for the furtherance of publike ſervices; for huge be the charges already imployed by your Maieſtie, for bringing to paſſe ſo great things tending to the ſound & vniverſall reformation of this your Realme of Ireland,Act of ſubſidie Ann. 11. cap. 1. fol. 148.
                as in the acte of ſubſidie more at large may appeare. What further honour now remaineth due vnto your Maieſtie, for the accompliſhing of ſo great & worthy actions, if not that which was ſometimes given vnto Ianus? for that you have chaunged the life of man which before your time was rude, cruell, and

wilde, in Ireland, and brought it for the moſt part to be obedient, gentle, and civill, in ſuch ſort as we may truely ſay with the ſubiect of Irelande, this is the favour which your Maieſty hath found in the ſight of God to augment, ſtrengthen, and honour your imperiall crowne of Englande, by the thorough reformation of this your Realme of Ireland. All which conſidering with my ſelfe, I could not ſuffer ſo honourable actions to bee buried in oblivion, without leaving ſome ſpeciall remembrance to all poſterities, but have made this plat & counterfet, the which I here preſent vnto your Maieſties ſacred handes, in baſer coulours then princes doe vſually beholde, or ſo weighty matters may require: but I hope that your Maieſties accuſtomed clemency will impute this to Solon his follie and lunacie, which now for his boldnes craveth pardon, rather then commendation.
            
               Your ſacred Maieſties moſt humble and loyall ſubiect RICHARD BEACON.
            
         
         
            
            The Authour to the Reader,
            
               GENTLE Reader, with the vnskilful archers of our times, I did firſt aime and ſhoote at the publique good and profit, according to the truſt repoſed in me, and now as one that hath loſt his arrowe, and miſſed his marke, I have at al adventures diſcharged the ſecond time, to the ende that my ſecond labours may drawe home my firſt loſſes, if my hande be fortunate to pearce the ſecret partes of thy tender and kinde affections, and move in thee a friendly acceptaunce of theſe my rude labours; if not, looke no more for my returne to accompany the pleaſaunt fieldes, and meddowes, for henceforth I take vp my habitation amidſt the rockes and deſerts, where my arrowes may not pearce, nor the ſtrength of my bowe withſtand the bitter windes, and the harde and hoary froſtes, where I ſhall no more play the foole with Solon in the market-place, but the wilde man in the deſertes. But if thou ſhalt vouchſafe to recall ſo vnskilfull an archer againe into the fieldes, I may perhaps winne a bet, that ſhall pay for the loſſe of a rubber. Receive then, Solon his folly, not as a teſtimony of his skill, but rather of the goodwil he beareth vnto thee, and his country, whereof if thou ſhalt make acceptaunce, the ſame is thy honour, and not his: which with thy bounty and goodnes, haſt now overcome as well the giver, as the gift. But if thou ſhalt cenſure it by his owne proper woorth, he hath fore-tolde thee the valewe thereof, and before thy face hath now waighed the ſame in equall ballance, with Solon his follie, but not with his wiſedome.
         
         
            
            The booke vnto the Reader.
            SITH Circe at the inſtance of Vlyſſes hath once againe graunted vnto dumbe creatures liberty of ſpeech, I may not but complaine, for that ſhe hath brought vs from our former reſt & ſilence, now to ſpeake before that wiſe Vlyſſes, who havinge not taſted of the ſweetenes and pleaſure of this our ſolitary life, ſince which time Circe firſt chaunged vs Graecians into the habite of mute and dumbe creatures, may fortune to advance his wiſedome, and to holde our former ſilence and reſt as contemptible. And againe of the other ſide, we beeing long deprived of the vſe and arte of ſubtill ſpeaking, ſhall much diſcontent wiſe Vlyſſes, with our homely diſcourſes. But O Circe, hath the love of Vlyſſes, and the cuntry of Greece, drawn thee vnto this indignation againſt vs, as with Epaminondas, naked and vnarmed, I muſt oppoſe my ſelfe againſt the ſcornes and reproches of al ages, as againſt a Graecian army? And with the fonde lover in Petrarke muſt thou of force make me a ſorrowfull miniſter thereof? And with the ſilly birdes faſt tied and bounde, muſt I repreſent the face of thy loving thoughts? Then what comfort remaineth, If I may not ſay with them, though here we remaine faſt tyed and bounde, ſubiect to all ſcornes and reproches, and bereaved of our former liberty and delightes, yet this one Ioy reſteth, that the Author of theſe our Calamities, is falne more deepely then our ſelves therin, in ſuch ſort as with vs he muſt taſt the bitterneſſe of diſdaine and contempt, with the which cōfort, I heere preſent my ſelfe vnto your moſt friendly viewe, hoping that this my naked and innocent ſimplicity ſhall have your leave if not your likinge.

            A BOOKE INTITVLED, SOLON his follie and lunacie, made for the better reformation of common-weales, conquered, declined or corrupted, by R. B.
         
         
            
               
                  EPIMENIDES PHAESTIAN.
                Wel met good Sir Piſiſtratus, in this holy place of the tēple of Venus, where though the ſacrifices bee finiſhed, yet notwithſtanding your devotion is highly to bee commended. 
            
            
               Piſiſtratus.
                You alſo are happely well ſaluted right wiſe and famous Epimenides, and this devotion which you have friendly now commended, is but a duety firſt vnto the Gods, and next vnto my friendes, amongſt whom I enumber you not the leaſt. 
            
            
               Ep:
                I am the leaſt in power I muſt confeſſe, that is worthy of Piſiſtratus, but not in goodwill: but what matter of importaunce hath cauſed your arrivall ſo vnexpected vpon this coaſt and haven? 
            
            
               Piſiſtratus.
                We leade heere a ſtrong army by the commaundement of the councell of Athens vnto Salamina, for the better repoſſeſsing and reforming thereof. 
            
            
               Ep:
                What? contrary to their former decrees and proclamations, which were ſo ſtreight, and that vpon paine of death, that no Citizen of Athens ſhould be ſo hardy, as once to mooue the queſtion to the counſell of the Citie, for the repoſſeſſing and reforming of Salamina? 
               
            
            
               Piſiſtratus.
                Yes verily: for when the Athenians did once beholde that their long and troubleſome warres, the which they had now ſuſtained againſt the Megarians, for the repoſſeſsing and reforming of Salamina did ariſe vnto them, not from the nature of the people, nor from the difficultie of that action, but rather that

they received all their advertiſementes for the advauncement of thoſe affaires, from ſuch as gave counſel therein, more for their private profit then for the publicke good, but chiefely for that ſundry governoures there placed, were found either negligent, or ignorant in the managinge of publicke affaires, they willingly revoked their publicke proclamations, and made choice of Solon, a moſt wiſe and expert governour for leading and conducting their armies, now heere landed for the repoſſeſsing and reforming of Salamina. 
               
            
            
               Ep:
                But who perſwaded this firſt vnto the Counſell of Athens? 
               
            
            
               Piſiſtrat:
               
                   Solon that faithfull counſellour of Athens. 
               
            
            
               Ep:
                But how durſt Solon the wiſe offende their publicke lawes and proclamations? 
            
            
               Piſiſtrat:
               
                   Solon holding it for an open ſhame the which woulde bee left vnto all poſterities, if the Citie of Athens ſhould not be able to repoſſeſſe and reforme Salamina, now commaunding the moſt partes of Greece, fained himſelfe to bee out of his wittes, and cauſed it to be given out that Solon was become a foole: and ſoone after on a day, cloathed with the habite, geſture, and countenaunce of a foole or man poſſeſſed with lunacy, hee ran ſodenly out of his houſe with a garland on his heade vnto the market place, where the people ſtreight ſwarmed like bees about him, and raiſing himſelfe vpon the ſtone where all proclamations were made, did ſo effectually perſwade the repoſſeſsing of Salamina vnto the people, as what with the weight of his reaſons, and the laud and praiſe every where ſpreade by his friendes of his proceeding therein, their former proclamations were revoked, & the wars for the repoſſeſsing and reforming of Salamina with greater furie then before were followed, they giving vnto Solon as I ſaide before, the leading of the army, and the whole managing of that action. 
            
            
               Ep:
                After this manner did Brutus by a fained frency and lunacie, not onely reforme the mighty Citie of Rome, but wiſely acquited himſelfe thereby, of the ſuſpition and ielouſie of Tarquine, by the which manner of proceeding, hee delivered as well the Citie of Rome, as his own perſon from perill & danger, ſo as this common proverbe did firſt ariſe, Simulare ſtultitiam nonnunquam ſapientis eſt. But where remaineth Solon my deare and familiar friende, that I may ſalute him, and give him the beſt comfort I maie, in this

worthy action of reformation? 
            
            
               Piſiſtrat.
                Hee is newly landed with his vvhole army, and hath nowe for his better recreation withdrawne himſelfe into a pleaſaunt and ſolitary garden neare vnto the temple of 
                     Ʋenus, wherevnto if your leaſure ſerve, I wil readilie conduct you. 
            
            
               Ep:
                I readily followe you. 
            
            
               Piſiſtratus.
               Sir I goe before as the beſt guide, and not the beſt man, and beholde Solon in the moſt ſolitary place of the garden. 
            
            
               Solon.
               Thriſe welcome my deare and familiar friende Epimenides, beholde, this ſolitarie and pleaſaunt place, as alſo the times, hath even newly conſpired with my thoughtes and deſires to impoſe a great and weighty labour vpon you. 
            
            
               Ep:
               No labour may bee thought ever ſo greate as ſhall exceede the greatneſſe of my goodwill I beare vnto Solon. But what may the ſame be? Tel it vnto me. 
            
            
               Solon.
               As you have of late moſt friendly lent vnto mee, your faithfull councell, and beſt adviſe for the reformation of the Citie of Athens, greatly to the advancement of that eſtate, in like manner now I am earneſtlie to entreate your moſt friendly adviſe for the better reformation of Salamina. 
               
            
            
               Ep:
               This labour and travell▪ I muſt confeſſe is due vnto Solon, if there wanted not wiſedome, which ſhoulde give ſtrength for the performaunce thereof: but I have choſen at this time, for our olde familiarity and friendſhippe, to give you iuſt cauſe rather to reprehende my ſkill, then to accuſe any parte of that office and duety, which in the higheſt manner belongeth vnto Solon; ſo as when the faulte appeareth, you ſhall acknowledge the ſame to bee impoſed by yourſelfe, and not received by mee without your commandement. 
            
            
               Solon.
               Then friendly Epimenides, before we enter into this large diſcourſe for the reformation of Salamina, I will declare vnto you a dreame, which this laſt night amazed my thoughtes. 
            
            
               Ep:
               I pray thee tell it vnto me. 
            
            
               Solon.
               This night I ſeemed to beholde faire Diana with a beautiful Dove gliſtering like golde, placed vpon her ſhoulder, ſlyding and wavering every where, in ſuch ſorte, as it ſeemed to me to be in great ieopardy of falling, but forthwith mooved with compaſſion I ſtretched foorth my right hande, to better and reforme the place of her ſtanding: wherewith I might beholde Diana with a ſharpe and ſowre countenaunce to threaten the loſſe of my hand whereat

being amazed, I did awake out of my drouſie ſleepe.
            
            
               Ep:
                 The people of Salamina, is the threatening Diana, hating all reformation: the golden Dove, is the pleaſaunt countrie of Salamina: the wavering of this Dove from place to place, is the frailty and mutability, wherevnto this countrie of Salamina hath ever beene ſubiect: the compaſsion which you have taken of this golden Dove, is the love you beare vnto Salamina: the moving of your body and hande, to ſuccour this golden Dove, is the ardent deſire now newly kindled in you for the reformation thereof: the loſſe of hande threatned by Diana, is the difficulties and dangers, which ſhall from time to time, oppoſe themſelves againſt you in this action of reformation.
            
            
               Sol.

                     A REFORMATION of a declined common-weale, is nothing els but an happy reſtitution vnto his firſt perfection: this worde Reformation being thus deſcribed, may in like ſorte be devided into two parts and members: the one may bee termed an abſolute and a thorough reformation of the whole bodye of the common-weale, namely of the ancient lawes, cuſtomes, governementes and manners of the people: the other may be termed a reformation of particuler miſchiefes and inconveniences onely, which like vnto evill and ſuperfluous humors dailie ariſe to the annoyance and diſturbance of this politicke body. For like as in our naturall bodies, ſaith the Phiſitian, ſo in common weales there daily ariſeth that, Quod curatione indiget, & niſi tollatur, inde morbos laethales parit. This maner of reformation of particuler miſchiefes and accidents conſiſteth of two partes and members: the one by the profitable laws, which are framed to meete with ſuch miſchiefs and inconveniences, which doe or may ariſe to the annoyance of the common-weale: ſuch was the law called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which pacified the poorer ſort of people called Hectemarij, then in armes againſt the rich and better ſorte of Athens: the other is the true diſcipline and execution of lawes ſo made and eſtabliſhed. This manner of reformation of particuler miſchiefes and inconveniences by good and profitable lawes, was mightily endevoured

by your ſelfe, when as the Athenians made choice of you as their general reformer of their lawes and common-weale. For you did not change the whole ſtate thereof, but altered onely that which you thought by reaſon you might perſwade your Citizens vnto, or els by force you ought to compell them to accept; and framed your lawes to the ſubiect and matter, and not the matter & ſubiect vnto your lawes, as ſometimes Lycurgus did in his reformation of Sparta. 
                  
               
               
                  Sol:
                  You have ſaide the truth, for if I ſhould have attempted to turne vppe ſide downe the whole government, & to have changed the whole ſtate thereof, I might afterwardes never have beene able with that ſmal power and forces then granted vnto me, to ſettle and eſtabliſh the ſame againe. Againe, I did not thinke, but that Athens then declined, might well have beene reſtored by this kinde of reformation.

                  No verily: for Quae primis inſtitutis omninò corrupta fuerit, eanunquam in tales caſus incidet, propter quos novis legibus inſtitui queat. For this cauſe the firſt inſtitution of Athens being meerly popular, corrupt, and vnperfit, coulde never after by any lawes made for the reformation thereof, be defended from the tyrannie of ſuch as did aſpire vnto the principalitie, or from the ruine firſt conceived in the corrupt inſtitution thereof. For notwithſtanding they eſtabliſhed many lawes for the reformation of the inſolencie of the noble men, as alſo to reſtraine the libertie of the people, non eam tamen conſervare ſupra centeſſimum annum potuerunt. But ſuch common-weals as have their firſt inſtitution and foundation good▪ though not altogether perfit and complete, at any time declining from the firſt ſtate and perfection, may by this manner of reformation (made by profitable laws as occaſion ſhal them require) be not only reſtored to their firſt perfection, but the happie eſtate thereof may thereby belong continued and augmented: ſuch was the

common-wealth of Rome, whoſe firſt inſtitution and foundation was ſo wel laid by Romulus & Numa, as that after by new laws made for the reformation thereof, as the neceſſity of that common weale did require, the ſame was rendered long, happy, and proſperous, in ſo much as it attained at the laſt an happy temper and forme of governement, compounded of three ſortes and kindes of gouernement, namely the Monarchia, Ariſtocratia, and Democratia: ſo that wee maie conclude, that thoſe common-weales which have their foundation good, though not perfit and complete, ex ijs quae ſubinde occurrunt, emendari & perfici queant ad exemplum Romae: for it is ſaide, non prima illa Romanae reip: inſtitutio tantum a recta via aberrabat, vt perfici non poſſet. Laſtly ſuch common-weales which in al the parts thereof are found corrupted and declined from their firſt inſtitution, maie not by profitable lawes made and eſtabliſhed as occaſion ſhal them require, be reformed; whereof ſometimes the Citie of Rome and nowe the ſtate of Salamina may be vnto vs an example: ſith neither the one after her finall declination, which did chiefely growe by a general corruption of manners in the people, could be reformed by the lawes againſt Captainſhip, againſt Coyney, and Lyvery, or againſt the vnlawefull cuſtome of ſupporting and maintaining of rebels or any other new lawe whatſoever; nor the other by their lawes ſumptuarij ambitus, and ſuch like, the reaſon whereof ſhall more at large appeare in this diſcourſe following.

Bingehame, mightily reforme and advance the government of Salamina, ſo as wee may truely ſay, by ſuch governours muſt this nation be reformed. By this manner of reformation hath France in times paſt, mightily advanced their government, and eſpeciallie the Citie of Paris, which alwaies hath moſt ſeverely puniſhed offendours.

                  This manner of reformation is made after two ſorts: either by lawes limiting the times certaine for this reformation; or accidentally thereunto led and provoked by occaſions: for ſo the Citie of Rome after the overthrowe given by the power of the Gaules did reforme their common-weale and all diſcorders formerly by them committed. The Athenians alſo after the Megarians had recovered from them the Ile of Salamina, and the haven of Nicoea, reformed that common-weale. And not long after the ſedition betwixt the people of the mountaines, the valleies, and ſea coaſts, did occaſion a generall reformation to be made of our Citie and common-weale of Athens. Againe, the Romaines to give an ende of many contentions raiſed betwixt the ſenators & people, ſent Sp: Poſth: Albus, A. Manlius, and Sulpitius Gamerinus, as legates vnto Athens, that they might the better be enformed of the laws which you Solon had eſtabliſhed for the reformation of Athens, that thereby as by a line, they might the better reforme the Citie of Rome; and further made choice of their Decemviri to perfit this their intended reformation by profitable lawes. 
               
               
                  Sol:
                  Now you have declared to vs the reformation which is made accidentally: there remaineth nowe the other reformation, which is made by

force of laws & at times certaine, wherin I would willingly vnderſtand the reaſon, that ſhould limit the times certaine of our reformation, and that by lawes certaine in that behalfe eſtabliſhed, fith the accidents, and occurrants in al common-weales, which doe occaſion this reformation made by profitable laws, be in themſelves vncertaine, and accidentall.

                  This manner of reformation made of particular accidentes at times certaine, and that alſo by lawes and ſtatutes certaine, eſtabliſhed in that behalfe, is founde more profitable then the other which is made accidentally.

And therfore it is ſaid, that if Roome, ſingulis decennijs, ſecundùm leges, aliquod magnum exemplum in delinquentes ſtatuiſſent, nunquam tanta morum corruptela potuiſſet civium animos occupare; ſed quia tandem rara eſſe caepit, aucta eſt tantopere morum corruptela, vt remedium nullum adhiberi potuerit. In like maner may we truely ſay, that ſo great a corruption could never have poſſeſſed the mindes of the people of Salamina, if there the exact diſc

                  The difficulties which herein ariſe, may lively appeare by the queſtion, which Caeſar propounded ſometimes vnto Pampey, and Craſſus, when he was Conſul preferring then vnto the Senate, the law for diviſion of landes, called Agraria; doe

you Craſſus and Pompey, ſaith he, give your conſents vnto the laws which I have now propounded? They anſwered, yea; then he prayed them to ſtande by him, againſt thoſe that threatened him with force of ſworde to let him. It may appeare alſo by that action of Pompey, when as he filled the market-place with ſouldiers, and by open force eſtabliſhed the lawes, which Caeſar made in the behalfe of the people. The ſame alſo was ſometimes lively expreſſed in the perſon of Lycurgus, which for the better eſtabliſhing of profitable lawes, gaged the loſſe of his eie; and you Solon the loſſe of your credite and reputation with the people of Athens; when as by the law

In an other aſſembly alſo of the Senate of Rome, Craſſus, Appius, and Nepos, prayed the Senate to proroge the government of Caeſar for five years longger, and to deliver money vnto him out of the common treaſure to pay his army, but others impugned the ſame; eſpecially Phannins.

For when Manlius Capitolinus was ſometimes accuſed as a mover of ſedition in Rome, his caſe was no ſooner pleaded, but the ſight of the Capitoll troubled his accuſers, and the Iudges alſo; when as pointing with his hand, he ſhewed the place vnto the Gods, and weeping tenderly, laide before them the remembrance of the hazarde of his life, in fighting for the common liberty and ſafetie of Rome, and in defending the Capitoll it ſelfe, and repulſing the Gaules; in ſuch ſort, as the Iudges moved with pittie, knew not what to doe, and therefore put over the hearing of his cauſe vnto another day, becauſe the place of his ſo notable good ſervice was ever ſtill before their eies: wherfore wiſely Camillus finding the cauſe of delay of Iuſtice, did make the place of Iudgement to be removed without the Citie into a place called the wood Petelian, from whence they coulde not ſee the Capitoll, where his accuſers gave apparant evidence againſt him, and the Iudges conſidering all his wicked practiſes, conceived a iuſt cauſe to puniſh him as he had deſerved, ſo as they gave ſentence of death againſt him. Further no orator, or pleader of cauſes, is to be ſuffered to ſpeake in the behalfe of offendors, either to move the Iudges to compaſſion, or to winne the offendors favour in the eie of the beholders. The miſchiefe which ariſeth hereby, did ſometimes appeare, when as Caeſar was ſuffered to ſpeake in the behalfe of Lentulus, and Cothegus, companions of Catiline in his conſpiracie, by whoſe eloquence the offendors had then beene delivered, or at the leaſt not committed to the handes of the officers to be put to death, if the gravitie and authority of Cato, and vehemency of Catulus, had not diſſwaded

the contrary. Laſtly, the more often princes ſhal acquaint their ſubiectes with the diſcipline of the lawe, the more great obedience ſhall the ſubiects yeelde, as well vnto lawes, as magiſtrates, and the leſſe difficultie and danger ſhall princes finde therin. For the right diſcipline of lawes, doeth admoniſhe men of their dutie, and doeth cauſe them to leade their lives agreeable to lawe, and from time to time doth ſuppreſſe the malice of the offendors. For proofe whereof, the Romaines ſo long as they vſed the iuſt and exact diſcipline of laws, they puniſhed the offendors without feare danger, ſedition, or mutiny; yea farther, when as they condemned Camillus vniuſtly, there was found no friend, no ſouldier, the number whereof were many and great, that durſt make any reſiſtance in his behalfe: for when as hee called vnto him his friendes and ſouldiers, which had ſerved vnder him in the warres, or that had taken charge with him, which were manie in number, he earneſtly beſought them, that they would not ſuffer him thus vilely to be condemned, through falſe and vniuſt accuſations laide againſt him, and to bee ſo ſcorned and defamed by his enemies: his friends having laide their heads togither, and conſulted therevpon, made him anſwere, how that for his iudgement they could not remedy it, but if he were condemned, they would al ioine togither with a very good will for the payment of his fine. But not long after, Cum toto decennio nullum Romae ſtatuebatur exemplum paenae delinquentium, then could not the Senate examine Ceſar with their ſafetie, neither yet coulde the Iudges condemne Claudius without peril.

                  Therefore in ſuch common-weales, where the manners of the people are altogether corrupted, for not applying in good time the diſcipline of lawes, it behoveth the Iudges, and ſuch as ſhall revive the force of auncient lawes by the exact diſcipline thereof, ſtrongly to be garded, according to the example of Cicero being accompanied with a ſtrong garde of Iuſtie men, when as Conſull he was to convict and execute Lentulus, and Cethegus, for their conſpiracies with Catiline. But Caeſar vnadviſedly refuſing a garde in ſuch caſes for the ſafetie of his perſon, did eftſones with the loſſe of his life approve his follie: for Brutus, and others, finding him asked in the Senate, without any ſtrength, or

garde did eaſilie execute their malice vpon him.

                  In like maner, governours in caſes of great extremities, for the avoiding of daungers and difficulties, may proceede againſt offendors, without obſerving the vſuall ceremonies of lawe. After this maner did Cicero proceede againſt Lentulus, and Cethegus, when as vpon proofe onely, in open Senate, without any lawful inditement or condemnation, he commanded their delivery into the handes of the officers to be put to death; for ſo much may be gathered out of Caeſar his Oration, who at that inſtant mightily inveyed againſt that maner of proceeding, ſaying, it was not lawfull, neither that the cuſtome of Rome did beare it, to put men of ſuch nobility to death, without lawful inditement or condemnation, but in caſes of extremity. This ſevere courſe and maner of proceeding in caſes of extremity, may not be deemed any part of tyranny, if either we wil give credite vnto the opinion of Caeſar, or vnto the fact of Cicero, and the Senate; or followe the cuſtome of Rome, or deeme Cato to be milde and iuſt, who then being in the Senate, did vehemently perſwade the ſame, and whoſe heart was ſo farre from crueltie, as beholding the dead bodies ſlaine in the campe of his enimies, in the laſt skirmiſhe betwixt Pompey and Caeſar, he covered his face and went away weeping.

Therefore it is a chiefe ſuerty vnto Princes, and great furtherance vnto actions of importance, to commit to ſafe-gard and priſon, ſuch as may give impediment thereunto: for the which cauſe king Fredericke did no ſooner intend the warres againſt the French, but he apprehended and put in priſon the Prince of Biſignā

The Romaines may herein be vnto vs a liuely example: for after they had ſubdued Aſia, Africa, and in a manner had reduced vnder their governemental Greece, they fell eftſoones into a corruption of manners, contrary to all their former diſcipline, inſtitution, and accuſtomed manner of living: their auncient lawes and cuſtomes eſtabliſhed for creating of Magiſtrates, they mightely abuſed; ſelling their voices of election openly in the market place for mony: in like manner did they abuſe al other their auncient lawes and cuſtomes, namely the lawes and cuſtomes, which devided the common-weale and power thereof into the handes of the people and Senators, ſo as there could not be a reformation of that eſtate, without a mutation made of thoſe auncient lawes and cuſtomes, then growne by the iniquitie of thoſe times out of vſe.

the ſubiect: ſo as in defaulte thereof, the kings enemies have them in ſervage; al murders, robberies, theftes, treaſons, and other offences, remaine vnpuniſhed; the kings wardes, reliefes, eſcheates, and all other his profits and revennewes are there withdrawne; and the ſervice, ſtrength, and aſsiſtaunce of the ſaide ſubiect, is greatly miniſhed; all which more at large ſhall appeare to ſuch as ſhall pervſe the ſaide ſtatute: ſo as we may conclude, that without a mutation, made of theſe auncient cuſtomes and priviledges now growne out of vſe, and declyned from their firſt inſtitution by a generall corruption in the ſubiect, the ſtate of Salamina may never be perfitly and thoroughly reformed. For as the ſtate of Rome, in manner as afore declined, coulde not by the lawes, ſumptuarij ambitus, neither by any other new lawe be ſuſtayned and vnderpropped, without a thorough alteration made of all other the auncient lawes and cuſtomes thereof; ſo may we not expect in theſe daies a thorough reformation of Salamina, by the lawes of Captainſhippe, the lawes againſt Coiney and Liverie, the lawes againſt taking of pledges, the lawes againſt wilfull murder, or any other new lawe whatſoever made for the reformation of Salamina, without a thorough alteration made of the auncient cuſtomes and priviledges thereof, all which we there ſometimes imployed in that ſervice, were daily taught, rather by experience then by any learned or deepe diſcourſe, that may be made therof. In like manner if the cuſtome of Captainſhippe, the cuſtome of Coiney and Livery, and the cuſtome of taking of pledges, the cuſtome of Taniſtery, the cuſtome of protecting and ſupporting of traitours, had not beene aboliſhed by lawes, then all newe lawes whatſoeuer would have beene founde vnprofitable for the reformation of Salamina: for in ſuch caſes it is ſaide by learned writers, that leges novae minus prodeſſe queant ad tollenda vitia quae regnant. Now ſith it is evident, that a thorough reformation may not bee made without a mutation of auncient laws & cuſtomes, which are found evill in themſelves, or els by mutation and chaunge of times have now loſt their firſt vigor and force, it behoveth that we doe vnderſtand, what order and rule herein is to be obſerved, for the more ready effecting thereof.

                  All authority herein graunted is after two ſortes: the one abſolute; the other limited by time, and other circumſtances. This authoritie abſolute, was given ſometime into your handes by the Athenians; for after ſuch time as they had well taſted of the lawe and ordinance, called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , they forthwith did chooſe you their generall reformer of the lawe, and of the whole ſtate of the common-weale, without limiting this power then granted vnto you, but referred all matters indifferentlye vnto your will, as the offices of ſtate, common aſſemblies, voices in election, iudgments in iuſtice, and the body of the Senate. Finally, they gave vnto you all power and authority, to ceaſe and taxe anie of them, to appoint the number, and what time the ceaſe ſhould continue, and to keepe, confirme, and diſanull at your pleaſure, anie of the auncient laws and cuſtomes, then in being. But this authority abſolute, without anie limitation of the power it ſelfe, or of the time and continuance thereof, hath ſometimes turned to the great preiudice and danger of ſuch as formerly have graunted the ſame: for the Romaines after

they had elected their Decemviri, for the making of a thorough and abſolute reformation of the common-weale of Rome, they forthwith gave into their handes the ſole and abſolute power of Rome, ſo as all other authorities and iuriſdictions either of Conſull, Senate, or Tribunes, ceaſing, they wholy and only governed Rome, without any provocation or appeale to bee made to any other. Thus when no Magiſtrate remained, which might obſerve the actions of ſuch as were founde ambitious, eaſily did Appius Claudius, fall into the thoughtes of the principality of Rome; he doeth ſtrengthē himſelfe with friendes, & clyēts, and daily increaſeth his wealth, and nowe of a Citizen is become a fearefull enemy to the ſtate of Rome; in ſuch ſorte, as they may neither endure his pride and inſolencie, neither may they ſafely ſuppreſſe the ſame without their common perill and daunger. Therefore more wiſelie did the Lacedemonians give great authority to their kinges; and likewiſe did the Venetians to their Dukes; but yet with certaine limits and bondes, not lawfull for them to exceede; and farther did appoint certaine watchmen, as daily beholders and obſervers of all their actions and doings.

                  But what limitation of time, in granting this abſolute authority, may breede ſafety vnto him that giveth the ſame? This is the ſeconde and laſt matter, nowe remembred by you, and worthie of conſultation.

                  The provinciall governement over the Gaules, with an abſolute power given into the handes of Caeſar, for the better reformation thereof, was ſo long proroged and continued, as at the laſt with the ſword of the Romaines, and the money of the Gaules, he became terrible, as well to the Gaules, as to the Romaines, & returned not a Citizen now of Rome, but as a fearefull enemie, and conquerour, as well of the Citie, as of all the other territories and dominions thereof. And was not alſo the provinciall governement of Spaine ſometimes given into the handes of Pompey with an abſolute authority for the reformation thereof, ſo long proroged and continued, as with one ſtampe of his foote he was able, (as himſelfe reported) to fill the Citie of Rome with weapons, and armed men? And did not Appius Claudius by proroging his authority but for one yeare, become fearefull to the Citie of Rome? And did not the Romaines by

making a Dictator perpetuall, looſe the libertye of their Citie? and doeth authority thus eaſily corrupt the maners of good ſubiectes? and is the age alſo wherein we live free from ſuch corruption? Nay, more then that, is there not an enemie on foote, that laboureth the corruption of the whole? Then what authoritie here may be limited ſo ſtraight, as in this time may not be thought too large? what time may be ſo ſhorte, which may not be deemed too long? Therefore let every good and faithfull councellour vnto the ſtate, with Cato reſiſt here the proroging of Caeſar his governement, leaſt too late with Pompey they acknowledge their errour: it ſhall not ſuffice here to graunt but one yeare more vnto Appius Claudius; neither is it ſufficient that Caeſar is holden in diſgrace with the Citie of Rome; neither may we here ſafely beleeve all which ſhall ſaie vnto Pompey, Caeſar is hated of the garriſons, and ſouldiers: for when Caeſar commeth with his fortune, he ſhall then force, as well Pompey, as the Citie of Rome, to acknowledge their former follies and errours:

                  You have ſaide the truth: for where the good-will of the people is firſt wonne and obtained, there the mutation is made, without difficultie and daunger. All which may lively appeare in the hiſtory of Tarquine, who having loſt as well the good-will of the people, as of the Senate, by changing the auncient lawes & cuſtomes of the Citie of Rome, was eaſily expelled that kingdome. 
               
               
                  Sol:
                   It is true that you have ſaid; for he did drawe vnto himſelfe all the authority, as well of the Senate, as alſo of the liberty of the people, which ſometimes they inioied vnder their former kinges, and for this cauſe chiefely, he failed of the good-will of the people, in this his mutation and alteration of thinges. But Brutus on the contrary, having wonne the good-wil of the people, for the effecting of a reformation, and expelling of Tarquine, did chaunge the ſtate of the common-weale, without anie difficultie, daunger, or iniurie ſuſtained by anie other, then the expelling of Tarquine. Likewiſe, when the Medicei Ʋrbe Florentinorum Anno ſalutis M.CCCC.XL.IIII. pellebantur, the chaunge was made without daunger and difficultie, for as much as the ſame was effected by the good-will and conſentes of the people. Sith therefore the conſente of the people, doth give ſo great furtheraunce vnto this action of reformation, it ſeemeth a matter verie neceſſarie, that everie Magiſtrate ſhoulde retaine the arte, skill, and knowledge, of perſwading and inducing the multitude, as you have in the firſt chapter of this booke well remembred.

                  So it is indeede, for the good-will and conſente of the people, doeth promiſe no ſmall ſecurity vnto the Magiſtrate which intendeth this action of reformation: and therefore not without cauſe, Pythagoras was of all ſortes of perſons greatlie honoured, for his ſingular arte and knoweledge in winning the affections of the multitude, and in perſwading, and diſſwading the people, all which Plutarch witneſſeth after this manner,

                        
                           Pythagoras which lov'd to dwell,
                        In higheſt dignitie:
                        And had a heart to glorie bent,
                        And paſt in pollicie:
                        Much like a man which ſought,
                        By charming to inchaunt:
                        Did vſe this arte to winne mens mindes,
                        Which vnto him did haunt.
                        His grave and pleaſant tongue,
                        In ſugred ſpeech did flowe,
                        Whereby he drewe moſt mindes of men,
                        To bent of his owne bowe.
                     
                  
                  Though Lycurgus vvas the eleventh which deſcended from the right line of Hercules, though a man of great authoritie, of great force, of long continuance a king, yet indevoring a reformation of many diſorders, which did chiefely ariſe in that eſtate, by the inequallitie of landes and poſſeſſions, therein (as Plutarch witneſſeth) he vſed more perſuaſions, then force: a good vvitneſſe thereof was the loſſe of his eie. You Solon alſo altered and

reformed that in the common-wealth of Athens, vvhich you thought by reaſon you ſhoulde perſwade your citizens vnto, or els by force you ought to compell them to accept. 
               
               
                  Epi:
                  The Romaines therefore well vnderſtanding the force of perſuaſions, in all actions of reformation, did inſtitute the holy order of the Faeciales, vvho retayning the art of perſwading, and diſſwading the people, did much further the common-weale of Rome; for they went many times in perſon to thoſe that did the Romaines iniurie, and ſought to perſwade them with good reaſon to keepe promiſe with the Romaines, and to offer them no wrong: they did alſo perſwade the people, to deliver Fabius Ambuſtus, vnto the Gaules, as one that had violated the lawes of armes, and farther proved by manie reaſons, that a preſent reformation made of that diſorder and iniuſtice, woulde deliuer Rome from many calamities, then like to inſue by the power of the Gaules. By this art and skill of perſuading, did Camillus appeaſe the great ſedition and mutinye, rayſed ſometimes by the people of Rome againſt the Senators, for that they had not their full minde and libertie, to inhabite the citie of Vies. By this art and skil, you Solon have now of late induced the Athenians to make warres with the Megarians for the poſſeſsing of Salamina, contrarie to their former liking, publike lawes, and proclamations made in that behalfe: and the like honour did you ſometimes winne by your oration, made in the defence of the temple of Apollo, in the citie of Delphos, declaring, that it was not meete to bee ſuffred, that the Cyrrhaeians ſhould at their pleaſure abuſe the ſanctuarie of the oracle; by force of which perſuaſions, the councell of Amphictions was thoroughly mooved, ſo that they ſought a preſent reformation thereof. By this your art and skill, you alſo perſwaded thoſe which in Athens they ſometimes called the abiectes and excommunicates, to be iudged, whereby you did quench and appeaſe two mighty factions, the one ſupported by the iſſues of the rebels, that roſe with Cylon, and the other by the ofſpring of Megacles. 
                  
               
               
                  Sol:
                  I acknowledge this your friendly reporte, not as a teſtimonie of anie art or skill, but of the office and duetie which I beare vnto the citie of Athens. But after this manner ſometimes a notable

mutinye and ſedition rayſed by the citizens of Salamina, againſt the Iuſtices of aſsizes and iayle deliverie, in my preſence was happely appeaſed. But nowe ſith the neceſsitie of the art and skill of perſwading is ſufficiently made knowne vnto vs, there remaineth, that you deſcribe vnto vs the art it ſelfe, with the partes and members thereof.

                  The art and skill of perſwading, conſiſteth in the knowledge of two matters eſpecially: firſt we muſt know hovve to commende the matter, or perſon of ſuch as vve intende to perſwade; then how to moove, winne, and diſpoſe the affections of the people. For the firſt, the Poet ſaith truly, that he ſingeth moſt ſweetely, that ſingeth my praiſe and commendation. 
               
               
                  Sol:
                  This which you have ſaide, did manifeſtly appeare after the battaile of Xerxes fought with the Graecian army, for then all the Graecian Captaines being in the ſtraight of Peloponneſus, did ſweare vpon the altar of their ſacrifices, that they vvould give their voices after their conſciences to thoſe they thought had beſt deſerved it, where every one gave himſelfe the firſt place for worthines, and the ſeconde vnto Themiſtocles. After this manner, did Publicola winne the good-will of Appius Claudius, a man of great ſtrength and reputation among the Sabines, in giving honour vnto him, by the way of an embaſſage, whereby he gave Claudius to vnderſtande, that he knevv him right well to be a iuſt man, and hated vvithout cauſe of his citizens; and therefore if he had any deſire to provide for his ſafetie, and to repaire to Rome, leaving them which cauſeleſſe wiſhed him ſo much evill, they would publikely and privatly receiue him vvith due honour; by vvhich meanes, Publicola did not onely winne Appius Claudius vvith thoſe of his faction, which were great and manie in number, but alſo ſtaied and turned the warres from the

                     Romaines, then intended by the Latynes and Sabines.

                  There remaineth now, that you diſcloſe vnto vs the knowledge, howe to vvinne, move, and diſpoſe the affections of the people, as the ſecond part and member, of the art and ſkill of perſwading.

                  EPI:
                  Herein three matters eſpecially are founde worthy of conſideration: firſt the affections what they be; ſecondarilie the ſubiect and matter, wherewith they vſually are mooved, and carried awaie, as with the violence of ſome tempeſt; thirdly the waies how to winne, moove, and perſwade the people, according to the example of the worthieſt and wiſeſt in times paſt. The affections which be the firſt, are in number theſe; love, hatred, hope, feare, diſpaire, and ſuch like; the matter and ſubiect which is the ſecond, is parentage, conſanguinity, friendes, goods, poſſeſsions, landes, the cuſtome and manner of living, honours, libertie and life; the preſence whereof wee loue and imbrace, and with their abſence wee are ſoone carried away vnto wrath, hatred, revenge, hope, feare, and diſpaire: therefore from hence as from a fountaine, have the wiſe governours in former ages, drawne all the force of perſuading; by the ſame have they induced the people to imbrace matters profitable to the common-weale, even againſt their wils. And hovv mightely theſe tranſitory thinges haue alwaies appeared in the eie of the multitude, it may appeare by the aunſwere given from the Athenians vnto Themiſtocles, whereas he perſwaded the people to leave their citie, goods, poſſeſsions, and landes, and to get them to the ſea for the better eſchewing of the Barbarian forces, vvhich then were ſo mighty, as the ſame might not vvell be withſtoode by the proper forces of the Athenians: In vaine (ſaith the people vnto Themiſtocles) doe we then ſeeke the preſervation of our lives, vvhen wee ſhall forſake the

graves of our fathers and auncetours. Such vvas the love they bare vnto thoſe tranſitory thinges: and therefore one amongeſt the reſt, ſpake in choler vnto Themiſtocles after this manner; Themiſtocles, for a man that hath neither citie nor houſe, it is an evill part to will others that haue, to forſake all; but Themiſtocles turning to him, replied, vve have willingly forſaken houſes and walles (ſaith he) cowardly beaſt that thou art, becauſe vvee vvill not become ſlaves, for feare to looſe thinges that have neither ſoule nor life.

                  Novv you are to give vs to vnderſtand, of the ſundry vvaies and meanes, hovv to vvinne, mooue, and diſpoſe the affections of the people, vvhich is the thirde and laſt matter by you remembred, worthy of every publike magiſtrate, vvhich ſhall indevour the knovvledge and art of perſwading.

                  EPI:
                  The vvaies and meanes how to vvinne, mooue, and diſpoſe the affections of the people, are vſuallie after tvvo ſortes: the one ordinary; the other extraordinary. The ordinary vvaies and meanes, are in number three: Firſt you ſhall vviſely obſerve the affections of ſuch perſons, as you intende to perſwade; ſecondarilie, you ſhall vviſelie acquit, and deliver, as vvell the matter, as the perſon of him that perſwadeth, from all ſuſpition of fraude and guile; laſtly you ſhall dravv the people vnto a particular conſideration of the matter you intende to perſwade. We muſt diligently obſerve their affections; for ſo Phanias Leſbian vvriteth, that the mighty and daungerous faction ſometimes entertained betwixt the rich and the poorer ſort of the citie of Athens, vvas by you Solon eaſelie pacified, in that you diligently obſerved the affections of either, and did ſecretly promiſe the poore to devide the landes, vvherewith they remained

highly pleaſed, to the rich you promiſed the confirmation of their contracts, which was the matter they chiefely deſired. Alſo you did not let to feede their humours and affections with the dailie publiſhing of this ſentence, equality doth breede no ſtrife; the which did pleaſe as well the rich and wealthie, as the poore and needy ſorte; for the one conceived of this worde equality, that you woulde meaſure all thinges according to the quality of the men, and the other tooke, for their purpoſe, that you would meaſure things by the number, and by the poule onely; thus both being pleaſed with you, for that you well obſerved their humours and affections, they gave into your handes ſoveraine authoritie for the ending of all quarrels, whereby that mighty faction was happely appeaſed, to the generall good of Athens. You alſo well obſerved the affections of the people, when as you clothed things bitter and vnpleaſant, with pleaſing names; calling taxes, contributions; garriſons, gardes; priſons, houſes; and ſuch like: by the which pollicie, you made even things odious, pleaſing and acceptable to the people, and eaſily thereby perſwaded the embracing thereof. In like manner Themiſtocles indevouring like a wiſe generall to augment his ſtrengthes by the aide of the Ionians, in his warres againſt the Perſians, did wiſely obſerve the affections as well of the Ionians, as of the Perſians then his enemies: for paſſing by ſome places, where he knewe the enemie muſt of neceſſity fall vppon that coaſt for harborough, hee did ingrave certaine wordes ſpoken vnto the Ionians, in great letters in ſtone, which he founde there by chaunce, or otherwiſe brought thither for that purpoſe; theſe were the wordes, that the Ionians ſhould take the Graecians part, being their firſt founders and auncetours, and ſuch as ſought for their liberty; or at the leaſt they ſhoulde trouble the army of the Barbarous people, and doe them all the miſchiefe they coulde, when the Graecians ſhoulde come to fight with them: by theſe wordes thus in graven, and diſperſed in fitte places, where the enemy was likely to harborough, he hoped either to induce the Ionians to take their part, or at the leaſt, that therby he ſhould make the Barbarous people, ielous and miſtruſtfull of them.

                  SOL:
                  Nowe you have ſufficientlie diſcourſed of the firſt meanes, whereby the multitude doe reſt perſwaded, the ſecond nowe remaineth, namely, the knowledge howe to deliver the matter and perſon of him that perſwadeth, from all ſuſpition of fraude and guile; for then all perſwaſions move mightily, and make a deepe impreſſion in the heartes of the people, when like vnto cleare waters, they deſcende from the pure fountaine of integrity. Therefore when Alcibiades perſwaded the people of Athens to invade and occupie the empire of Sicilia, wel hoping that the people woulde aſſigne him general of that armie, Niceas a man of rare and excellent virtues, rather regarding the publicke good then his privat profit, diſſwaded the contrarie; and to the ende the people ſhoulde be throughly perſwaded of his integritie herein, he ſpake vnto them after this manner: in times of peace, the Citie of Athens affordeth many Citizens, which ſhall have place before me, but in times of warre, I nothing doubt but to be the chiefe and firſt among them; and therefore be you confident in this, that I nowe diſſwade the warres, for that it ſtandeth more with the publicke good, then with my private profitte. In like manner Numa, the better to deliver himſelfe from the ſuſpicion of fraude, in all matters wherein he laboured to induce and perſwade the people, hee obſerved two matters eſpecially: firſt he perſwaded them, that he did worke t
                        •
                     e reformation of that common-weale by the meanes and helpe of the Gods, in which action no fraude may receive place, for that they be for the moſt parte, alwaies accompanied with integrity and ſincerity of minde; ſecondlie hee perſwaded nothing vnto the people, but that which himſelfe performed in perſon: for Numa iudging it no light enterpriſe (ſaieth Plutarch) to plucke downe

the hautie ſtomackes of ſo fierce and warlike a people, did pacifie their fierce courages to fight, with daily ſacrifices, prayer, and devotion, wherein he ever celebrated himſelfe in perſon. In like manner, when you Solon were to publiſh your lawe called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the better to perſwade the people of your integrity herein, you were the firſt that followed your owne proclamation, and clearely releaſed your debters of fifteene talentes then due vnto your ſelfe. 
               
               
                  Sol:
                  So I did, though it ſtoode with my loſſe and hinderance. But nowe there remaineth the thirde and laſt meanes, vvherewith the multitude is mightely induced and perſwaded, formerly by you remembred, vvorthy of conſultation, namely, that vve drawe the people vnto a particular conſideration of ſuch matters as vve intende to perſwade.

                  EPI:
                  You have remembred that which I could not well forget, the fame being alwaies founde the moſt aſſured vvay to induce the people: for in conſulting and diſputing of matters in generall, they greatly erre, iudging all thinges to proceede from other cauſes, then from the true cauſes thereof. Therfore vviſely Camillus, vvhen as he indevoured to perſwade the people of Rome, from the inhabiting of the citie of 
                        Ʋies, then for the ſame cauſe being fallen into a mutinie, he deſcended vnto particulars with the multitude, and pointed vvith his finger vnto the graves of their fathers, and auncetours, ſaying, will you needes inhabite the citie of 
                        Ʋies? And will you forthvvith forſake the graves of your fathers and auncetours? And will you now leave the holy temples dedicated to the Gods, and ſanctified by Numa and Romulus? And wil you ſuffer the holy fire now newly kindled, now once againe to bee put out? And finallie, vvill you leave this your naturall citie (pointing with his finger vnto

the citie of Rome) to be inhabited by ſtraungers in time to come, or els to be a common paſture for vvilde beaſts to feede on? By vvhich manner of perſwaſion he eftſoones appeaſed the mutinye, and quenched their ardent deſire for the inhabitinge of 
                        Ʋies. After this manner, did Pacuvius proceede in pacifiyng and ſubduing the peoples affections from killing their Senatours; which matter by them was fully determined, vntill ſuch time, as he conventing the people and Senatours, as for the hearing and determining of ſome publike and waighty cauſe, did proceede with them after this manner: now my friends and Citizens (ſaith he) that which you have even with an ardent deſire and affection long wiſhed, namelie the puniſhment and correction of this deteſtable and wicked Senate, the ſame hath fortune now given into your powre and handes, freely to diſpoſe of them at your pleaſure, being nowe altogether naked, and cloſed in on everie ſide with walles, where, without tumult of the Citie, and perill of your perſons, you may freely diſpoſe of them; but leaſt you ſhoulde preferre the deſire of private revenge, before the common ſafety of al here gathered together, it behooveth before you give ſentence of theſe Senatours, whom you doe mortallie hate, that you proceede firſt to the choice of others; for of force you muſt either have Senatours, which alwaies have bene the moſt wiſe and fit councellors of free eſtates; or otherwiſe you muſt of neceſſitie fall into the hands of a Lorde or King, which free eſtates haue ever hated; proceede therefore to the election of new, and make choice of better men, which may ſupply their places: this matter appearing vnto the people doubtfull, did hold them long in ſilence, but at the laſt one among the reſt beeing nominated, their clamour and noyſe farre exceeded their former ſilence, ſome affirming they knewe him not, ſome accuſing his perſon, others deſpiſing his baſe art and ſcience; and much more in the choice of the ſecond, and third, this diſſenſion was increaſed, they being more baſe and obſcure, then the firſt: then beholdinge the grounde, vvith ſhame faſtnes they confeſſed their former errour, ſayinge, they did chuſe rather to tollerate an old evill, then a new, which might farre exceede the olde. In like manner the people of Rome, conſulting

at large, founde that they ſuſtained in all warres the greateſt force of the enemie, they found themſelves alſo to be called to all labours and workes, whereby the common-wealth was to be preſerved or augmented, and ſo forthwith they iudged themſelues as worthy of the office and dignity of the Tribuneſhip, and Conſulſhip, as any Patrician whatſoever: and therevppon contended, that the Tribunes ſhould be equally elected, as wel of the one as of the other ſorte; the which beeing vnto them graunted, and deſcending to make election, could finde none in particular worthy of that honour, or at the leaſt ſo worthy as the Patricians and nobles were; then forthwith they did acknowledge their former errour, and made choice of the Patricians only. After this manner, the people generallie conſulting of the delaies and cunctation, which Fabius vſed in repelling the forces of Hannibal, forthwith they condemned him to be a cowarde and faint harted; but afterward they waighing that their councell by the ſeverall events and overthrowes they received by the raſh and over-haſty proceeding of 
                        Ʋarro the Conſull, and of Marcus Senteinius, with others, they did ſoone after adiudge the wiſedome of Fabius to be ſome rare and divine influence received from the Gods. In like ſort the people of Rome, after ſuch time as Brutus and Caſſius had fully executed the conſpiracie then intended againſt the perſon of Caeſar, generally conſulting of that action, remained for a time, as indifferent beholders thereof, neither accuſing, neither yet making allowance thereof; but no ſooner did Caeſar his friendes ſhevv forth his teſtament, his ſeverall legacies vnto the people, his manie and cruell woundes, and thoſe every where freſhly bleeding and increaſing like a running ſtreame, the people as poſſeſſed with ſome furie or frencie, every vvhere in the market place, every where in the corners of the ſtreete, in privat houſes, in the fieldes, and in the vvoodes alſo, cruelly murdred all ſuch, as vvere partakers vvith Brutus in that action. After this manner, the auncient Tirantes of Athens, contending ſometimes to perſwade the people to labour, and eſpecially to til and ploughe the grounde, thereby to render them more obedient vnto their governement, did give out a certaine fable; they

tell of the Goddeſſe Pallas, that ſhee contending vvith Neptune about the patronage of the countrie of Athens, brought foorth and ſhewed to the Iudges the Olive tree, by meanes whereof ſhe obtained the preheminence: by vvhich particular demonſtration made, the people vvere mightily induced to labour and till the land. After this manner the people of Rome, generallie conſulting of the diviſion of landes gained by conqueſt, did fall into mutinies and ſeditions againſt the Senators; then vviſely the Senators deducted forthwith certaine colonies out of the confines of Italie, vvhereby eftſoones the multitude vvere given to vnderſtande, of the particular charge, travell, and other ſundry inconveniences, that did ariſe by poſſeſsing of lands gained by conqueſt, vvherewith all mutinies vvere appeaſed. Thus the magiſtrate that intendeth to perſwade the people, muſt not generally conſult of matters, but muſt deſcende vnto particulars vvith them; and therefore that oratour ſhall moſt readilie perſwade, vvhich ſhall dravv his argumentes and the force of his perſwaſion, ab effectibus, ab exemplis, or ſuch like: and theſe be the ordinarie perſwaſions.

                  Such were they which Themiſtocles ſometimes vſed, for (ſaith Plutarch) vvhen all other perſwaſions failed, and coulde not worke that publicke good which he then intended, hee did threaten the Athenians with ſignes from heaven, and with Oracles, and aunſweres; and when as he coulde not perſwade the Citizens of Athens, no not for the ſafegarde of their lives, to departe the Citie at the comming of Xerxes, vvhoſe forces they were not able to withſtande, hee pollitiquely cauſed a brute to be ſpread abroade among the people, that the Goddeſſe Minerva, the protector and defender of the Citie of Athens, had

forſaken the Citie, pointing them the vvaie vnto the ſea; and againe, he vvonne them with a propheſie, which commaunded them to ſave themſelves in walles of woode, ſaying, that the walles of woode, did ſignifie nothing elſe but ſhips; and for this cauſe Apollo in his Oracle, called Salamina divine, not miſerable and vnfortunate, becauſe it ſhoulde give the name of a moſt happie victorie, vvhich the Graecians ſhoulde gette there; by vvhich extraordinarie perſwaſions, hee did induce them at the laſt to leave the Citie of Athens, and to betake themſelves to the ſea: by occaſion vvhereof, they did not onely deliver themſelves from the handes of their enemies, but became at the laſt conquerours, and victours over them. In like manner, when all ordinarie meanes of perſwading failed to effect the reformation ſometimes intended by Numa, he made his recourſe to theſe extraordinarie helpes and meanes, laying before the peoples eies a terrour and feare of their Gods, bearing them in hande, that they had ſeene ſtraunge viſions, or that he had heard voices, by vvhich their Gods did threaten them with ſome great troubles and plagues: whereby hee did pull downe and humble their hearts (as Plutarch witneſſeth) and made thereby a thorough chaunge and reformation, aſwell of the common-weale, as of the manners of the people. Therefore Plutarch not without iudgment affirmeth, that the multitude in matters vvaightie, and difficult, reſt ſatiſfied and perſwaded, rather by extraordinarie, then by ordinary meanes: all which he doeth lively manifeſt, vvhereas he induceth the multitude exclaiming vppon Themiſtocles, for not ſacrificing the three young priſoners, in ſo much as Themiſtocles forced by their rage and clamour, did ſacrifice at the laſt the three priſoners; wherewith the people remained fully perſwaded, that the victorie ſhoulde be given vnto them over their enemies. Againe, ſometimes it fareth vvith the multitude, as with the ſicke patient, vvhich being overcome with the greatneſſe of his malady, is therby become ſo impatient, as he refuſeth all wholeſome medicines, vvhich may breed his health and ſafety; the vvhich malady ſometimes poſſeſſed the people of Athens, when as they reiected your counſell for the vvithſtanding of the tyranny of Piſistratus, having

then newly vvith his forces entered the caſtle, and forte of Athens, vvherewith the people ſtoode ſo amazed, as they ſhewed themſelves more vvilling to ſuffer that evill, then able to prevent the ſame by your counſell.

Therefore the Florentines did not a litle erre, which in the times of their difficult warres, helde Antonie Iacomine above all others in greate eſtimation, for that onely he had taught the Florentine army, as it were with his finger, to fight, conquer, and commaund: yet in milder times, when as the warres by his induſtrie were growne eaſie and placable, they little regarded thoſe his vertues, in ſuch ſort, as when three Captaines were propounded to be choſen for the ſuppreſsing of the Piſans, he was not accepted to be one of that number; from the which errour this miſchiefe did ariſe vnto the Florentines, that the Piſans, which by the induſtry of Antonie might eaſily have beene reformed, and forced to have obeyed the Florentines, made eftſoones head againſt thoſe vnskilful Captaines ſo ſtrongly, as the Florentines were forced diſhonourably to purchaſe their obedience with money. Againe Phillip of Macedonie, after he had behelde the affaires of the Athenians to be given into the handes of Moloſſes, Caridemus, and ſuch other vnskilfull Captaines, he conceived a great hope to overcome them. In like manner, the weakenes and facilitie of Collatinus the Conſull, did much encourage the traitours, in ſuch ſorte, as he had never prevailed againſt the Tarquines, nor reformed the ſtate of Rome, if the great vertue and ſeveritie of Brutus had not governed at that time the helme and ſterne; whereby the courage and boldnes of the traitours, raiſed by the ſuffrance and lenitie of Collatinus, as a tempeſt was ſuddenly calmed and pacified.

After this manner, did Numa alter and chaunge the accuſtomed manner of living, and the manners of the citizens of Rome, from a warlike liberty to a life peaceable and obedient, and that by little and little as (Plutarch witneſſeth.) But others led with the opinion and reaſon of Plato, ſay, that to reforme a miſchiefe after this manner, is no other but to cut of one of the Hydraes heads, of the vvhich came afterwardes ſeven in the place: and therefore Agis and Cleomenes toke vpon them to make a chaunge and innovation even at once, and as it vvere with one conſtant ſtroake of the hande, to cut of all the miſchiefes of their country, ſo as wee may conclude, that the formes and maners of reforming of miſchiefes in the common-weales, be ſundry and diverſe, the which proceede ſometimes of the diverſitie of meanes and occaſions, which diverſlie doe offer themſelves; as alſo from the diverſitie of the ſubiect and matter, which being

This order did the Romaines ſometimes obſerue in inſtituting of there popular governement, and in reforming of auncient lawes and cuſtomes, after they had expelled their kings; for they

altered the ſubſtaunce, and left in place thereof onely a ſhadow and reſemblaunce of the thinges altered; for in place of their kings they produced two Conſuls, ſed vnum tantum faces habere voluerant, & quidem totidem numero quot reges vſurpare ſolerent: and whereas their kings in perſon did perfourme certaine publicke ſacrifices, regem ſacrificulum creant qui hiſce ſacris praeeſſet, vt nequaquam apud eos regum deſiderium eſſet. Thus by retayning the ſhadowe onely of auncient lawes and cuſtomes, the people remaine thereby perſwaded, that nothing of the ſubſtaunce thereof is taken away or diminiſhed: in like manner, they carefully obſerved this rule of pollicie in the creation and election of Magiſtrates and officers, for although they aſsigned vnto them newe offices & functions, yet they did wiſely holde the auncient names, ſtile, and number with their former magiſtrates, that the people might deeme thereby nothing to be altered and chaunged.

For after this manner did king David eſtabliſh an vniverſall reformation. In like manner Lyſander, did pull downe the pride of the citie of Athens, and tooke from them the libertie of a popular governement, vvhereby in former times it was ruled and governed, and eſtabliſhed there ſharpe and ſevere magiſtrates. But ſome others carried with a contrarie diſpoſition of minde, have not attempted a thorough and generall reformation of the common-wealth, but reſerved onely vnto themſelves a principalitie and commaundement, the which forme of governement was obſerved by Sylla; for when he had taken the citie of Athens, after the citizens had made fierce warres with him, yet hee

lefte it free vnto them, enioying their owne laws. The ſame counſell did other of the Romaines followe, as it appeareth by the wordes of Camillus vſed vnto the Senate after he had conquered the Latines: Dij immortales ita vos potentes huius concilij fecerunt, vt ſit Latium an non ſit, in veſtra manu poſuerint, ſi vultis crudelius conſulere in deditos victoſ

                        ; ſed ſi vultis exemplo matorum augere rem Romanam victos in civitatem accipiendo, materia creſcendi per ſummam gloriam ſuppetit. It ſeemeth therefore by the wordes of Camillus, that the Romanes made not at al times a thorough and vniverſal reformation of common-weales which they gained by conqueſt, but embracing rather the counſell of Sylla, reſerved onely a prncipalitie and commaundement; for by this meanes, they did eaſily nouriſh the ambition which they had in conquering: for ſuch as have a purpoſe to performe great actes, and to winne fame and glorie, having a mighty power to effect the ſame, they maie ſafely follow the ſteppes of Sylla, and other of the Romaines, they may ſay with Camillus, let vs exemplo maiorum augere rem Romanam victos in civitatem accipiendo, materia creſcendi perſummam gloriam ſuppetit: but ſuch as ſhall contend to make continuance of their conqueſt, being not of great forces and power, ſhould imitate Lyſander, and make a thorough and abſolute reformation of the whole common-weale. For Plutarch erred not, when he ſaide that Sylla did performe the greater actes, but Lyſander committed the fewer faultes, and did poſſeſſe with greater ſecuritie that which he conquered. Phillip of Macedonie, followed the ſteppes of Lyſander, whereby, poſſeſſing at the firſt but a ſmall kingdome, he became in a ſhorte time a mighty commaunder of all Greece.

                  The Gaules in like manner following the ſteppes of Lyſander, did ſecurely poſſeſſe for a long time the partes of Italie, called Longobardia: ſome others have beene found neither to imitate Sylla, nor Lyſander, but have helde a meane courſe betwixt both, in eſtabliſhing their governement. Such were the Florentines, which in ſuppreſsing the rebellion of the Aretines, did remove ſome of their principall commaunders from their place and offices, others they banniſhed, manie they condemned, but they did not reſume into their handes the landes, which might have afforded ſufficient

maintenaunce vnto their citizens, neither did they deſtroy the principall citie, but preſerved the ſame; whereby they loſt the opportunitie of confirming their empire and governement, and of augmenting their common-weale. This meane courſe hath never as yet beene founde happy and proſperous: For not throughly conquering our enemy, neither by ſworde, neither yet by our bountie and liberalitie, vve may not long holde them, either as ſubiects or friendes. Therefore ſuch as ſhall contend to be proſperous, and make continuance of their ſtate, and governement, muſt with the Romaines, ſo ſuppreſſe and ſharpely puniſh the Latines, as at no time they be able to rebell, or with bounty and goodnes ſo winne the affections of the privernates, as at no time they ſhould be willing to rebell. The meane courſe in times paſt hath beene holden for the governement of Salamina by a long ſpace; In which times they were never founde happy and proſperous in their governement.

From this fountaine ſpringeth ambition, deſire of revenge, mutinies, ſedition, treaſon, and rebellion, finallie it leaveth no place, no not the Senate houſe of Rome, nor the pulpit for orations, nor the image of Pompey, no not the open & publicke market places vndefiled and free from bloud, no not the pallace of princes,

                  The chiefe and principall remedies are found to be in number three: namely a ſecret prudence and wiſedome; ſecondarily good lawes well executed; thirdly a ſucceſsion of ſevere Magiſtrates: for no doubt like as the wilde olive and figge tree, by the continuall addreſsing of a skilfull husbandman, is made at the laſt kindely, profitable, and fruitfull, and not inferiour to the naturall braunches; ſo a common-wealth overgrowne with a generall corruption of manners, and thereby become ſavage, barbarous, and barren, like vnto the vvilde

olive and figge tree may by the continuall pruning and addreſſing of a skilfull magiſtrate, be made obedient, civill, and profitable vnto that prince, whom God hath conſtituted to be the labourer in that vineyarde; the which is to bee effected by the three waies and meanes before remembred: the firſt whereof is a ſecret prudence and vnderſtanding, wherein two matters principallie are found worthy of conſideration: firſt the ſubiect and matter; ſecondarily the time; for as the infirmities in our naturall bodies, growing vppon contrarie cauſes, receive not their cure by one ſelfe ſame councell, and medicine, for the which cauſe we endevour, to cure the frenzie by reſt, and by motion the lethargie; ſo it fareth with the infirmities of a pollitike body; for where the corruption of manners in the multitude groweth by wealth, reſt, and ſecuritie, there it receiveth his preſent cure with the lethargie by motion, diſperſing the humours, and finally by ſharpe correction and diſcipline: but otherwiſe it is where the ſame proceedeth from extreame aduerſitie for there it receveth a happy cure, with the frenzie by eaſe, pacience, and ſufferance, for Contraria ſubiecta non debent eodem modo tractari: Wherein Charles the fift hath lefte vnto vs an example, when as he ſtoode before Meats in Loranie with his army, vvhich vvas then ſo diſtreſſed by extreame ſickneſſe and famine, as they openly railed on him, eſpeciallie his Spaniſh woulde call him the ſonne of a mad woman with all the vile wordes they could deviſe, yet he would not heare them, but threw crownes amongeſt them, ſaying to his nobilitie, harken theſe knaves, yet if I call the worſt by his name, he will not refuſe to doe anie thing for me though it coſt him his life. The like wiſedome was ſhewed in the like matter by Caro, and other Senatours of Rome, at ſuch time as when the poore and needy perſons which at that time had repoſed all their hope and confidence in Caeſar, had compaſſed the Senate houſe and called aloude for Caeſar then accuſed before the Senatours, bidding them to let him out, Cato then to acquite the common-weale of the inſurrection of the poore and needy perſons, did not ſeverely correct them, but contrariwiſe perſwaded the Senate to make a francke diſtribution of corne amongſt them for one moneth the which amounted to one

hundreth and fiftie Myriades made at the common charge of the citizens, by the which councell he quenched not onely a preſent great feare, but did in happy time ſcatter and diſperſe abroade the beſt part of Caeſars force and power, at ſuch time as hee was made Praetor, and that for reſpect of his office he vvas moſt to be feared. The ſame councell did Pericles ſometimes imbrace, when as the people of Athens did mutine againſt him, for that he would not ſuffer them to hazarde the battaile with the Lacedaemonian army, then burning and ſpoiling in all the partes of their countrie; for he did not then with bitter ſpeeches and ſharpe puniſhmentes pacifie that mutinie, but contrariewiſe with a large diſtribution which he cauſed to be made amongſt them out of the common treaſure, and diviſion of lands that were gotten by conqueſt, he did quench that ſedition. And it is ſaid, that when Luctatius, one of the greateſt authority at that time in Rome, did inveigh againſt Caeſar, in that he had ſeditiouſly ſet vppe the honoures and victories of Marius contrarie to their publike lawes and decrees, and vrged then a condigne puniſhment aunſwerable to ſo greate an offence, he ſpake nothing for the puniſhment of the people which then gathered themſelves together for the aide of Caeſar, and the rather for that they being of the faction of Marius, had bene long oppreſſed and troden vnder foote by the authoritie of Sylla. In like manner, when we ſhall beholde men of rare vertues and great deſertes towardes the common-weale, in times of peace and libertie contemned and deſpiſed, with Narcetus that rare and excellent captaine, leaſt thereby they fal with him into a generall corruption of manners, and combine with the king of Lombardy, for the invading of Italy, wee ſhall wiſely vvith the Venetians in ſuch caſes, alwaies better the fortune of thoſe which have faithfully ſerved, & never remoue them from their former dignity, without giving to them places of higher and greater commaundement, and vvith Themiſtocles not only ſpeedily revoke the baniſhment of Ariſtides, and ſuch others of his quality, but alſo to advaunce them to greater honour then before, fearing leaſt otherwiſe he take part with the Barbarian nation to the ruine of the ſtate of Greece. But herein one caution is wiſely obſerved, that in ſuch caſes contending to

remove a corruption of manners, which may otherwiſe poſſeſſe the mindes of rare and excellent perſonages, by a contempt and diſdaine vvhich followeth them, chiefely in times of happineſſe, wealth, and ſecuritie, wee doe not endaunger thereby the whole ſtate of the common-wealth, the which vvee ſhall then eaſilie prevent, if we ſhal not imploy them in the greateſt places of commaundement, leaſt contending to acquit themſelves vvith Claudius Nero, of all diſgraces and iniuries wrought by the deceit of Hasdruball, they deſperately hazarde, and put in adventure the vvhole ſtate thereby. Neither are wee in ſuch caſes with the Romaines, to giue vnto Camillus diſcontented with his baniſhment the ſupreame commandement of the City and army; for after ſlaughter made of all other their captaines by the power of the Gawles, they vvere ledde therevnto rather by neceſſitie, then by vviſedome; neither doe all men baniſhed and diſgraced, carry vvith them that honourable minde of Camillus, and that ripeneſſe of iudgement, to preferre the honour and publike good of the common-vveale before his private reputation and vvelfare: But on the contrary, if vve ſhall labour to cure the corruption of manners that groweth by peace, vvealth, and ſecuritie, vve are in ſuch caſes, vvith Luctatius to remove the ſame by ſharpe diſcipline, whoſe councell if the Senatours had then followed, many miſeries and publike calamities, vvhich the ambition of Caeſar ſoone after vvrought againſt the citie of Rome, had beene vviſely foreſeene and prevented: or otherwiſe in ſuch caſes, if wee ſhall like vnto the wiſe phiſition diſperſe abroad thoſe peſtilent humours according vnto the example of Camillus, and with him imploye the citizens of Rome, novv puffed vp with the pride and inſolency of their nevv obtained victorie and conqueſt of Vies, and with the rich ſpoiles thereof, now in mutinie againſt the Senatours and nobles, novv reſorting vvith great tumult about the pulpit for orations, for eſtabliſhing of laws tending rather to the deſtructiō then to the diviſion of Rome, as in the warres againſt the Phalerians, and there beſiege the chiefe citie, not ſo much with a purpoſe to winne the ſame, but rather with him to keepe our countrie men buſied, leaſt by repayring to Rome, they ſhould take occaſion to mutine;

whereby with the wiſe phiſition we ſhall diſperſe abroad thoſe humoures, which may trouble the quiet ſtate at home. Laſtly if wee ſhall wiſely take holde of time, whilſt ſhe is running her ſwifteſt courſe with her force and violence, perhaps vve may be caried more then vvith an ordinary expedition vnto the height of our thoughtes and deſires; for the times which ſhall repreſent vnto vs the ſhevv and face of publike calamities, as famine, plague, peſtilence, povertie, and warres ſhall mightily advaunce this action of reformation: for ſo the Senatours of Rome by an appearaunce of forraine warres did often pacifie the mutinies and ſeditions of the citizens of Rome, raiſed for the law of diviſion of lands gained by conqueſt: and the Romaines after the battell of Cannes gave due obedience vnto Magiſtrates, and did ſeverely proſecute their lawes againſt the Veſtall Nuns, and finally whatſoever the Magiſtrates did commaunde, the people would moſt readily obey. The like obedience was ſometimes found vnto lawes and Magiſtrates, after the people of Rome had received their overthrow by the power of the Gawles, in ſuch ſort, as the corruption of manners that then reigned in them vvas ſoone quenched and reformed. The times alſo which did produce ſundry publike calamities in Vlſter parcell of the dominions of Salamina, did worke there the like effectes, as it appeareth in the ſtatute of Attainder of Shane Oneile; where it is ſaide after many publike calamities ſuſtained by the warres, they cried firſt for mercy, and then for Iuſtice, in ſuch ſort, as the reformation of that country did offer it ſelfe eaſie vnto the handes of the Magiſtrates that woulde laie holde thereof, as by expreſſe wordes of that ſtatute more at large may appeare. Wiſely therefore Plutarch in comparing the actes of Fabius with Pericles, ſaith, that Pericles governed the Athenians in their chiefeſt proſperity and wealth, whereby they were corrupted in manners, and rendered inſolent, and mutenous, and not eaſily governed; but Fabius then governed Rome, when as it was humbled by many adverſities, eſteeming it a matter of no great difficultie, to rule a citie all ready brought low by adverſitie, and which compelled by neceſsitie is contented to be governed by a wiſe man.

The like lawes did Romulus, Numa, and other governoures which ſucceeded them, carefully from time to time eſtabliſh, as neither their long peace and reſt which they enioyed in the governement of Numa, neither yet the fruitfulneſſe of the ſoile of that empire, nor the commodities of the ſea, neither their daily victories, could by the ſpace of a long time and many ages, corrupt the manners of the people. In like manner the Germanes above all others have beſt continued the integritie of manners in the ſubiect, chiefely for that they have not onely beene moſt ſtudious of profitable lawes, but alſo moſt faithful obſervers thereof, the which thing above all others hath preſerved their people and country, as well from this corruption of manners, as alſo from the ſervitude and oppreſſion of others. And where it is ſaid, that Spaine hath not fallen ſo deepely as Italy, and Fraunce, into a generall corruption of manners, this proceedeth not from the goodneſſe of their nature, but from the ſtrict obſervation of the auncient lawes and cuſtomes of that kingdome.

In like manner, diſorders were ſometimes committed in the countries of Flamminia and Emillia, by the negligence of Magiſtrates in not executing the lawes, before Pope Alexander the fixt had wiſely diſplaced and removed the negligent governoures thereof; before which time, theſe regions were full of theft, robberies, and rebellions, the vvhich offences did not ariſe from the nature of the place or people, as ſome did then ſuppoſe, but rather from the malice and negligence of their governoures; for they beeing poore, woulde notwithſtanding live richly, and ſumptuouſly; they made lawes, and were the firſt that offended againſt the ſame, and by their example invited others therevnto; neither did they puniſh any that offended the lawes, vntill they increaſed to great ſtrengthes and numbers, ac tunc demum (ſaith the author of this hiſtorie) non Iuſticiae conſervandae cauſae, ſed praedae dulcedine permoti, paenas ab omnibus ſimul graviſſimas exigebant; ex quare hoc ſequebatur abſurdum, vt expilati aſſiduis illis mulctis homines ad paupertatem redigerentur, atque hinc impellerentur ad vexandos alios, quibus exiſtimabant ſe viribus eſſe ſuperiores, quo quidem modo vitia non emendabantur, ſed ad ea homines inſtituebantur, dependebant que haec omnia ex prava eorum regulorum natura. Laſtly, the many and ſundry priviledges are found to give impediment vnto the execution of profitable lawes, and to nouriſh a corruption of manners in the ſubiect, as more at large it doth appeare in the act of Abſentes, which is lefte vnto vs as a regiſter of the fall and declination of the ſtate of Salamina, vvherein it is manifeſt that the Lordes of the ſeveral countries of Catherlagh and Wexfords being places priviledged, may keepe and holde al manner pleas vvithin the ſame, vnder colour whereof the kings lawes,

                  They which ſhall live and governe Sparta, where the people are in manners corrupted, muſt with Cleomenes ſharpely proſecute and puniſh offendours; but where the manners of the people be not corrupted, there a milde courſe of governement doth worke his office, and carrieth with it allowance and commendations. For this cauſe it is ſaid, that the patience of Peter Soder
                           •
                        n was profitable as well to the common-weale as to himſelfe, ſo long as the age and time continued milde and gentle, but after the times were chaunged into an iron age, the

Therefore very well ſaith a learned author, for the better reformation of manners corrupted in the people, and for the better reviving of the force of auncient lawes, a ſevere Magiſtrate is requiſite.

                  This queſtion admitteth one other diſtinction: for an abſolute Prince is to imitate the humanity of Cyrus deſcribed by Xenophon, but ſuch as ſhall governe by way of deputation, are rather to follow the ſeveritie of Manlius Torquatus, leaſt otherwiſe with Peter Lawredane, we doe not onely make the Venetians ielous, but alſo diſable our ſelves by our lenitie and ſoftnes, to performe this difficult action of reformation, wherein ſeveritie is required. To conclude, it muſt be that grave and ſevere Tymaſicheus, that ſhall reforme the licentious citie of Lyparenſis, and drawe them from ſpoiling, praying, and rebelling. Laſtly, wee muſt make a continuall ſucceſsion of ſevere Magiſtrates, as before I have remembred.

                  I will proceede then vnto the inſtitution it ſelfe, wherein forme matters are found worthie of conſideration: firſt, the ſoveraintie and commaundement; ſecondly, the forme of governement; thirdly, the forme and manner of the inſtitution it ſelfe: laſtly, the ſeverall endes and ſcopes of this inſtitution? For the firſt, which is the ſoverainty and commaundement, the ſame is given ſometimes into the hands of one,

ſometimes in the handes of fewe, and ſometimes into the handes of all in generall. This one is termed a Democratia, or a popular eſtate; the other an Ariſtocratia; the laſt a Monarchie, Thus be common-weales properly diſtinguiſhed by the ſoveraintie and commaundement, and not by the diverſity which ſometimes appeareth in the forme and governement thereof: for all inſtitutions are made after the one of theſe kindes, and all other are but corruptions of theſe eſtates, and no proper or diſtinct common-weales. 
               
               
                  Sol:
                  But which inſtitution is to be preferred above others? 
               
               
                  Epi:
                  The inſtitution no doubt of the Monarchie, is the moſt firme and durable, and freeſt from al diſſention, mutinies, and ſedition. And the wiſe men of Rome vvere not deceived, when beholding the market place filled with bowes, ſlings, and ſwordes, and the pulpit for orations ſprinckled with bloud, they ſaid, there remaineth nowe no other way to give helpe and remedie to theſe troubles of our common-weale, but the authority of one man onely, that may commaunde vs all. And as this eſtate is freeſt from trouble, as you have ſaide, ſo is it of all others moſt honourable and glorious, and even the very lively image of God and nature, as Artibanus did ſometimes faithfully deliver vnto Themiſtocles. The next manner of inſtitution in account, ſeemeth to be the Ariſtocratia, for that it acquiteth it ſelfe beſt of al other common-weals, from corruption & errours in their cenſures and iudgements: for as the large and running waters, are not ſo eaſily corrupted, as the ſtanding poole; ſo many wittes, and mindes, are not ſo eaſily deluded and corrupted, as one. But worſt of all others doeth this common-weale acquite it ſelfe of envie, diſſention, and emulation amongeſt themſelves, which like vnto a mothe or worme, gnaweth a ſunder the heart and intralles of that common-weale, and at the laſt confoundeth and deſtroieth the ſame. But yet the popular eſtate is of all others leaſt permanent, eſpecially where the common-weale is mere popular, aſwell in regard of the ſoveraintie and commaundement, as of the forme & manner of governement; wherof the common-weale of Athens maie be vnto vs an example, which was inſtituted by you Solon, and after in the ſame age confounded by Piſiſtratus:

So it was: for wanting ſufficient power and forces, I was forced to make ſuch lawes for the inſtituting of that common-weale, as they vvere willing to receive, and not ſuch as I was willing to give: for I muſt confeſſe, that popular inſtitution, which is equallie tempered, and compounded of the three ſortes and formes of governement, after the maner and inſtitution of Rome, to be more firme and durable; and this forme of governement alſo doeth give a perfection and continuance to all other eſtates before remembred. Therefore Romulus after the death of Remus, and Tatius Sabinus, did ayme at that forme of government in the inſtitution of the common-weale of Rome; for he reſerved vnto himſelfe the ſole and kingly auctority over the armie onely, and to convent the Senators for the affaires publicke, the which forme of governement, in his perſon was kinglike, and after the forme of a Monarchie; but in the perſon of the Senators, who had auctoritie to conſulte, and publikely to perſwade and diſſwade the attempts for wars, and to diſcuſſe all other civill cauſes, as the ſtate of that common-weale required, the forme of an Ariſtocratia, was rightly by him obſerved; and in the other partes of his governement, as in framing of his lawes and ſuch like, he rather affected a popular liberty, then a Monarchie.

But ſuch as ſhal ayme at honour and glory, as the butte & ſcope of their inſtitution, muſt entertaine ſtraungers, they muſt indevour to render the common-wealth populous, they muſt daily traine and exerciſe the people in military diſcipline, and they ſhal wiſely deliver the feble, and weake, from the hands of the oppreſſour, they muſt entertaine many aſſociates & friends, by the which pollicies they ſhall render themſelves every where invincible according to the example of the Romanes.

But the common-weale

captivity of Iudah, regardeth not thee O king, nor the decree that thou haſt ſealed, but maketh his petition three times a day. But vnderſtande O king, that the lawe of the Medes and Perſians is, that no decree or ſtatute which the king confirmeth, may be altered or broken.

How diſpleaſing oppreſsions be every where vnto the multitude, the ſame the people of Salamina have livelie vvitneſſed, when as they tearmed ſometimes the exactions of Coiney and Liverie, impoſed by the nobility and Lordes of that land, by the name of grievous exactions: nay vvith great Emphaſies they tearme it the frette of our times, and ſubſtaunce: nay yet with greater indignation carryed againſt this manner of oppreſsion, they tearme it by the name of that horrible and moſt deteſtable cuſtome of Coiney and Liverie, yea they terme it to be the very nurſe, and teate, that gave ſucke and nutriment to all diſobedience, rebellions, enormities, vices, and iniquities of that realme over fowle and filthie, here to be expreſſed, and ſuch as did iuſtly provoke the wrath and vengeance of the almighty God vppon the people of that lande. The like oppreſsion of the nobility over the meaner people, was ſometimes the authour of many ſeditions in Rome, and provoked the people to demaunde Tribunes, which as arbitrators of the inſolencie of the nobility, might give them iuſt defence from their oppreſſion. And this ſtirreth the people ſometimes the better, to make their deliveraunce from the oppreſsion of the mighty, with the conſent of the forrain enemy, even to the invading and deſtroying of the people & country.

Firſt for that the ſame was effected with the conſentes of the ſubiectes, and not forced and commaunded, as ſometimes the Iſraelites were by Samuel, which in his oration vnto the people, ſaide, Regem habituri eſtis, qui decimas fructuum vobis imperaturus eſt: neither here are they preſſed by the authority of any duke of Albane, to render the tenth part of all things vendable, Vnde porro Belgarum ab Hiſpanis rebellantium orta ſeditio.

                  I hold reaſonable tributes to be a matter of ſo great importaunce and neceſsity, as Princes may lawfully commande and exact the ſame at the hands of the ſubiect, and therefore ſaith one, Quid enim reſtaret, quo princeps imperium tueri poſsit, ſublatis portorijs ac tributis? And therefore when Nero offered to acquite and deliver the ſubiect of all tributes and impoſitions, wiſely the Senate after thankes rendred vnto Nero, diſſwaded the fact, Ne Reſpub: aere diruta, momento collaberetur; ſaying, though many ſeditious perſons deſirous of innovatiō have promiſed the people immunitie of all tributes and impoſitions, yet to graunt the ſame it were altogither vnlawefull; and if

                  Be it ſo, that they may commaunde a matter ſo neceſſary for the ſuſtaining and vpholding of the common-weale; yet for the avoiding of ſedition, and the diſcontentment of the people, their conſentes are required, the time alſo is to bee regarded, the nature of the common-weale is to be reſpected, and laſtly the imployment of thoſe tributes ought to be vnto publike vſes. For Princes in the beginning of their governement are not to impoſe tributes, fearing leaſt the ten tribes for this cauſe ſhall rebell, and that a new king be choſen in the place of Roboham. But at ſuch times they ſhal more wiſely with the Frēch King being newly poſſeſſed of the Duchey of Milbaine, acquite & diſcharge the people of al tributes, which did mightilie as then advance his conqueſt. Againe, the nature and condition of the common-wealth is a matter no leſſe worthy of conſideration, then the time: for if the common-weale hath beene from time to time a free eſtate and not ſubiect to others, as ſometimes the Romaines were, to ſuch eſtates all manner of tributes are grievous, and therefore not to be exacted, but vppon vrgent cauſes, the which ceaſing, the people ought to be delivered from tributes. But the people of Florence on the contrary, having alwaies lived in ſervitude, and as tributaries to others, admitte vvillinglye all ſortes of impoſitions and tributes from time to time impoſed vppon them by their duke: and for this cauſe Salamina long ere this might have beene made profitable vnto Athens, for that they have alwaies lived in ſervitude, and ſubiect to all impoſitions and tributes, and many exactions have beene reared there by force and violence, to the maintenaunce of idle and evill diſpoſed perſons, the which being converted to private vſes and not to publike ſervices, have little profited the Citie of Athens; all which the recordes and ſtatutes of Salamina, doe many waies witneſſe, and eſpeciallie the ſtatutes againſt Coiney and Liverie: and therefore the laſt matter which is the imployment of tributes to publike vſes, is not the leaſt; vvherein vvee are to have diverſe regardes: firſt, care is to bee had of the Prince and his family; ſecondarilie of the ſtipendarily

ſouldiers, the vvhich two matters are chiefely reſpected and regarded in the compoſition before remembred; thirdly of magiſtrates, which for want of their pay and ſtipend, doe more egerly ſometimes then the ſouldiers rob and devour the people; fourthlie of ſuch as have well deſerved of the common-weale. Finallie care is to be had of the poorer ſubiects, leaſt by want, and extreame povertie, they become movers of ſedition.

                  The charge being thus defrayed, to the ende exact paiment may be made, it were convenient that the ſouldiers vvere payed by the poule; for if paiment be made as now vnto the Captaines, the ſouldier receiving not the ſame in due time, dareth not complaine againſt him, but is driven to ſeek his maintenance by oppreſſing of the people. Thus oftentimes the ſouldier is founde to hate his captaine which faileth to make paiment, and the captaine diſliketh the ſouldier, becauſe he faileth in order and government, ſo as by this private malice, impediment is given oftentimes vnto publike ſervices.

                  But ſith wee have diſcuſſed at large of the principall occaſions of declining of eſtates and common-weales, and of the waies and meanes to ſuppreſſe the ſame, it remaineth that we intreat at large of the diſtemperature of this polliticke body: for it behooveth princes not onely to foreſee and prevent occaſions of their declining, but alſo to knowe the nature of this diſtemperature, and howe it hath his ſubſiſting and being, and by what meanes the ſame may be ſuppreſſed; for in vaine ſhall occaſions offer themſelves, where this diſtemperature is not kindled, or being kindled where it is ſuppreſſed.

                  You have moved a matter of good importaunce, whereof the firſt is a diſtemperature of this polliticke body, the which is nothing els but a declininge

from a iuſt proportion eyther in obeyinge or governing the ſubiecte. This diſtemperature with all other thinges hathe his beeinge and ſubſiſtinge from his proper matter and forme: the matter alſo hath his beeing, eyther from a generall corruption of maners in the people, as in the times wherein Galba, and Pertinax lived and raigned, who though moſt iuſt and vpright kings, were notwithſtāding ſlaine by their ſubiects; or els it proceedeth from a corruption in the heade onely, the which ſometimes raigned in Tarquine; for if the people had then beene corrupted in maners, they could not have beene founde ſo conſtant defendors of their liberties, and ſo deſirous of reformation. The forme as in all other things, ſo vnto this diſtemperature as vnto his proper matter it giveth his ſubſiſting & being, the which forme if we ſhal deſcribe, it may be reſembled to a faire cloake givē to cover foule practiſes, ſhaped out by a cunning workeman, whereby the people oftentimes remaine deluded, and the common-weale ſubverted; for ſo ambitious perſons deſirous of innovation, have alwaies proceeded vnder an honeſt cloake and ſhew, to diſtemper and diſquiet the common peace of the weale publike, and therefore it is truely ſaide, Ambitio tam per virtutes quam per vitia nos oppugnat. 
                  
               
               
                  Epi:
                  But heere we are to obſerve this caution, that if this forme hath not his proper matter vvhich is the corruption of manners in the people, vvherein it maie make a deepe impreſſion, the diſtemperature that groweth thereby, ſhall eaſilie be recovered: and for this cauſe the forme vvhich Tarquine gave to his ambition, was eaſilie defaced by Brutus, and 
                        Ʋalerius, for that the manners of the people vvere not then corrupted. In like manner Marcus Manlius, and Spurius Caſſius, had ſet downe vnto themſelves a forme of diſturbing the peace of the common-weale, and for the advauncing of their owne ambition, but finding the manners of the people then vncorrupted, the matter wanting into which, the forme which they before had framed, might be received, they both failed of their purpoſe. But otherwiſe it fareth vvith the common-vvealth, when this forme hath founde his proper matter and embraceth the ſame, namelie the corruption of manners in the people; for in ſuch a caſe there is kindled foorthvvith

ſo mighty a diſtemperature, as without great reſiſtaunce it maie not be quenched: and for this cauſe the forme of ambition vvhich ſometimes Sylla, Marius, and Caeſar, had framed vnto themſelves, meeting and concurring at once vvith the corruption of manners in the people as his proper matter, did aſſuredly advaunce their ambition, to the overthrow of that eſtate. Therefore moſt falſe is that poſition, vvhich affirmeth, that the people corrupted in manners, are more eaſily held in ſubiection, then a nation vncorrupted. The ſeconde caution to be obſerved, is the conſideration of the ſundry formes of diſturbing common-weales, vvhich vſually doth advaunce her ambition not after one ſelfeſame manner, but ſometimes vvith a ſhevv of profit, ſometimes vvith the ſhevv of magnanimitie, and at other times ſhee promiſeth an alteration and chaunge of thinges to the contentment of al. After this laſt manner ſhe preſented her ſelfe ſometimes vnto the Athenians, and therefore it is ſaide, that notwithſtanding the citizens of Athens obſerved and obeyed the lawes, which you Solon made for their reformation, yet they were found ſo corrupted in manners, partly by reaſon of their ſeverall factions, and partly by idleneſſe, vvherewith the citie of Athens was well neare deſtroyed, as they deſired nothing ſo much as a change and alteration of thinges, every man hoping thereby to be better then his adverſaries. Secondarily by a ſhevv of magnanimitie, the people of Rome were ſometimes induced ſo farre to imbrace the counſell of 
                        Ʋarro for the reſiſting of Hannibal, as thereby they neare periſhed themſelves and the common-vveale. Finally, many are no leſſe bewitched with a gliſtering ſhew of profit and gaine, the which Pericles vvel vnderſtanding, did forthvvith devide the enemies landes gayned by conqueſt, among the people, and did appointe them rewardes for all thinges, and did make large diſtributions among them, whereby at the laſt he did withdravv their obedience from the counſell Areopagite, vnto his ſole rule and governement: in like manner Phillip of Macedonie corrupted certaine tirauntes of the Ile of Euboea, who with money in like ſort corrupted the people, vvhereby they became rebels and traitoures to their countrie; after the ſame manner he corrupted and

ſubdued the moſt partes of Greece, but ſhall not now the infinite calamities and miſeries of the other partes of Greece: admoniſh vs not to be deceived with this forme of ambition vvhich Phillip of Macedonie hath now framed to our vtter deſtruction? O you Graecians, let him not ſay as heretofore, with my treaſure I have corrupted and ſubdued the moſt parts of Greece, & have found there no fort ſo ſtrong, but that with an Aſſe laden with golde, I might enter the ſame, fearing in the ende hee make vs his Aſſes and Mules, to carrie his ſilver & golde and not to vſe the ſame, or rather ſlaves to be committed to perpetuall bondage: but let vs with the noble Romaines, refuſe the money of Spurius Caſſius, Ne libertatem vendere eo pretio videamur; let vs not give credit to his flattering orators the Ieſuits, which bribed by Polycarphon laboure the deſtruction of Athens; let vs not be infamous with the Neapolitanes for vnconſtancie; let vs not be led this day to affect the French, and to morrow with a new inſinuation of Ferdinando; for ſo it will be, when the yoke of the French ſhall once ſeeme heavie and vntollerable vnto our ſhoulders. In vaine then with the labourer of Phrygia, ſhal we digge the earth, and ſearching ſay, we ſeeke for Antigonus; for ſuch as governe, doe rule as tyrauntes and oppreſſors over vs: in vaine with the vvorthy woman of Megara, ſhal we take vp the bones of Phocion in the night, & give vnto them the honorable ceremonies of buriall, for the affaires of the Athenians may not proſper, becauſe Phocion is dead; in vaine ſhal we then cry and ſay, O deare hearth & toombe, we pray thee faithfully to keep the bones of this honourable perſonage, vntil ſuch time as the Athenians ſhal repent them of the many iniuries and wrongs done vnto him, for Phocion is now dead, and the affaires of the Athenians may not proſper: in vaine ſhall we make vnto our ſelues a coſtly ſtand or image in remembraunce of ſo worthy a perſonage, for the affaires of the Athenians ſhall not proſper, in that Phocion is dead. Let vs therefore in time with the wiſe governour ſuſpect the flattering of this our enemie, as the calmenes of the ſea, which is naught elſe but a manifeſt token of a preſent and imminent tempeſt; and with Cicero and Cato, withſtande in time the flatterie and ambition of Caeſar, leaſt with the Romanes to late we repent the ſame: let vs not as men

overcome with the greatnes of the tempeſt, deſperately ſeeke our ſafety in the middeſt of the rockes and ſands, but rather let vs fighting for our Prince and country, ſay, we will overcome, or die.

                  But what meanes are left vnto vs to ſuppreſſe this diſtemperature?

                  Firſt we are to give impediment vnto the forme and manner, and vvith 
                        Ʋalerius deny the embaſſadoures of Tarquine to ſpeake vnto the people, leaſt by flatterie they be deluded: with Brutus vve are to condemne and execute even our owne ſonnes, corrupted by Tarquine: and with 
                        Ʋalerius we ought to deny the deliverie of Vendicius vnto the traitoures: thus we muſt give impediment vnto the forme, wherein this caution is to be obſerved, that the ſame be done in the beginning. For the Romanes having ſometimes laide a forme of their ambition for the diſturbing and conquering of others, the ſame was at the firſt litle regarded, vntill they had advaunced their ambition ſo highly, as to late their aſſociates and neighboures did acknowledge their errour, and when they much deſired, they founde themſelves much vnable to ſuppreſſe the ſame.

                  What other meanes remaine to ſuppreſſe this diſtemperature? 
               
               
                  Epi:
                  Firſt wee are to proceede by good and profitable lawes to the ſuppreſsing thereof: for the Romanes being given to vnderſtand, that forty ſeveral nations had combined for their ruine and deſtruction, they did forthwith create a Dictator to manage the affaires of their vvars, vnto whome they gave an abſolute power; all which, as well the manner of the creation, as his authority and continuaunce was eſtabliſhed by lawes, fearing leaſt when this diſtemperature ſhould bee once thoroughly kindled in the bowels of the common-weale,

they might want either time to effect the ſame, or that this innovation might then give occaſion of mutiny. Secondly, we are to make preparation for the wars, and with Themiſtocles daily to arme and exerciſe the Athenians, to builde and vittaile our gallies, for the battaile of Marathon (ſaith he) will not give an end vnto theſe warres, but rather it doeth foretell vs of greater troubles. Thirdly, we are to reſiſt this diſtemperature by the force and ſtrength of our alies, confederates, and aſſociates: and herein above all others, we are highly to eſteeme and regarde the confederation of free Citties and eſtates; for they doe not eaſily, or for light cauſes depart the ſame, in regarde they proceede iudicially by voices, as well to eſtabliſh, as to diſſolve the ſame; the which caution Tuſci olim obſervabant, and therefore it is ſaide, Multum negotij fuit populo Romano cum Tuſcis hoc modo inter ſe confederatis: by which obſervation they became as well by ſea as by lande, mighty commaunders; ſo as it is ſaide, Quod ante tempora Romanorum Tuſci potentiſſimi fuerint terra mari
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                        . After this manner doe the Helvetians at this day proceede in their warres: and in times paſt, Achaei at
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         Aetoli. In like manner the Romaines the better to overcome all difficulties in their warres, did make an aſſociation with other free Cities and ſtates, by the which manner of proceeding, they did every where conquere and commaunde. But the Lacedaemonians, and the Athenians, not making anie confederation, or aſſociation with other free Cities, did not long continue their greatnes. Fourthly, wee muſt bee able at all times to produce a collected power and ſtrength of our proper ſubiectes, well trayned and exerciſed in military diſcipline, for the ſuppreſſing of this diſtemperature; for otherwiſe the Thebanes and the reſt of the Citties of Greece, ſhall decline and revolte from the Lacedaemonians; and Italy ſhall revolte from the Venetians, Quoniam reſp: Spartanorum & Venetorum populum habuit imbellem; therefore ſaith one, In promptu habeas exercitum egregium ad exemplum Romanorum, quo motos liceat componere fluctus. Fiftly, neceſſarie it is, that we doe poſſeſſe all the ſtrong fortes and holdes, the which although they ſhall litle availe vs againſt any general or ſtrong aſſault made againſt them, by ſuch as commaunde the fielde, for that either

with the forte or rocke of Arazze, they ſhall give place vnto the furie of the artillerie, or with the towne and forte of Avon for want of ſuccours, or with the towne Valencey by the treaſon of Donate Raffaguin; yet they beeing placed vpon the confines of the countrie, may withſtande all ſodaine attemptes, and give ſuccour vnto the wounded and diſeaſed. Sixtly, for the better ſuppreſſing of theſe diſtemperatures, we are to take hoſtages and pledges vvith king Porſenna, from ſuch perſons as are likely to departe from their obedience, to the diſturbance of the common peace, and tranquillity of the ſubiectes, by the vvhich way hee ſuppreſſed the malice of the Romaines; then ſhall we ſafely with him diſſolve our armie, and vvithdrawe our ſtrength. The people of Salamina hath in all ages beene founde ſo factious and rebellious, even in the times before Athens made their conqueſt over them, as the whole kingdome being then devided into foure ſeverall partes and provinces, vvhich they tearmed kingdomes, yet all beeing commaunded by the king of 
                        Ʋlſter, they did from time to time yeelde many of their beſt and chiefe perſonages, for pledges and hoſtages of their obedience vnto the king of 
                        Ʋlſter: if then their native borne kinges alied, foſtered, maried, and continued even one in the others boſome, did yeelde pledges for their obedience, howe may we in this troubled age ſafely diſmiſſe pledges, and ſet them at liberty? may we expect greater fidelity, then they bare ſometimes to their native kinges? or doe theſe times offer more ſecuritie? or doth this nation vſe more fidelitie? who ſo looketh into the hiſtories and recordes of their newe and late warres, ſhall finde in them their olde diſpoſition to rebell; and that this vniverſall obedience which nowe they yeelde, is nothing but a ſodaine heate or calme, vvich is the true meſſenger of a tempeſtuous weather. The ſeventh caution obſerved for the ſuppreſſing of this diſtemperature, is ſpeedily to diſarme the people, and not ſuffer them at all to be trained or exerciſed in militarie diſcipline, eſpecially where the people be not free, but obedient and tributaries vnto vs: for the vſe, knowledge, and exerciſe of militarie diſcipline, doeth render them bolde, turbulent, diſobedient, and rebellious againſt vs: for what boldneſſe and diſobedience raigneth

in the people of Salamina, by trayning and exerciſing them in the feates of warres,Anno. 10. H. 7. cap. 13
                      the ſame may lively appeare in their recordes and ſtatutes, where it is ſaide, that diverſe perſons have aſſembled with banners diſplaied againſt the lievtenaunt and deputie of the ſaide lande, whereby many times the deputie hath beene put to reproch, and the common-weale ſet in adventure: for this cauſe it is ſaide, that Veneti & Spartani opera plebis in bellis non vterentur; and more wiſely the Lacedaemonians holding Thebes vnder their ſubiection and obedience, woulde not permitte that anie Cittizen of Thebes ſhould be trained in the warres, but rather laboured to render them peaceable, and by eaſe and reſt, ſoft and effeminate; and there was no ſmith to be found through all the lande of Iſraell, during ſuch time as the Philiſtians held them in ſubiection, leaſt the Hebrewes make them ſwordes and ſpades, ſaie the Philiſtians. Let vs then drawe the people of Salamina from the exerciſe of the warres; let vs with Numa coole and pacifie the hoate courage of the Romaines to fight, by the daily vſe and exerciſe of religion, prayer, and devotion; and let vs vvith the ancient kinges of Athens, draw them vnto planting, ſowing, & ploughing the land; and let vs there advance and ſhewe forth the olive tree vnto the iudges; let vs there from henceforth honor the Godeſſe Pallas, and not Mars or Neptune, as heretofore; for ſhe of right ought there to prevaile, and have preheminence; for ſhe it is that ſhall cauſe the people to imbrace with all humility and obedience the governement of kinges. Put that great number of Heilotes to laboure, and plough the grounde, and let no man be trained but the free Citizen, ſaieth Lycurgus, let them yeelde vnto vs magna vectigalia, and let vs give vnto them magnum & egregium exercitum, if nede ſhall require. Laſtly, let vs advance all occupations and ſciences with the counſel Areopagite, that thereby they may be drawen from the ſtudy and thoughts of innovation and change, for difficilis res eſt, ſaith a learned writer, innumerabilem multitudinem a principe vel a paucis coerceri, niſi plebs operibus intenta quaeſtum faciat. Therefore wiſely did ſometimes Pericles, Vespaſianus, Auguſtus, and nowe the Venetians, holde the mindes and thoughts of their Citizens alwaies occupied and imploied in

labours, occupations, and ſciences.

                  There are which finding this polliticke body diſtempered, have devided the ſame into partes and factions, whereby as a ſmoke parted into many rivals it looſeth his principall force: for with the aide and aſsiſtance of the weaker parte, they have ſuppreſſed the ſtronger, and then eaſily commaunded the weaker; and for this cauſe it is ſaide, that the kinges of Aegypt have heretofore devided their regions and kingdomes by factions, Ne vnquam conſpirare inter ſe Aegyptij omnes poſſent.

                  This courſe of governement is never to be embraced, but vpon a great extremitie, when as neither there remayneth counſell, nor forces, which otherwiſe may ſuppreſſe this diſtemperature: for thereby foure miſchiefes ſhall ariſe vnto the ſtate; firſt the rentes, revenewes, cuſtomes, compoſitions, tributes, eſcheates, and other profites annexed vnto their crowne, ſhall thereby ceaſe; for it is ſaide, the Florentines by their civill factions, that firſt received their beginning of the diſorders which were in the governement popular, were rendred as well vnable to pay the French king the reſidue of the money which had beene lent them by the Duke of Millaine, as alſo to defray the ordinarie charges of the warres with Piſa. The like miſchiefe did ariſe vnto the ſeverall townes of Bomagua, from their ſeverall factions and diſorders; but why doe we ſeeke forraine examples? did not all compoſitions, cuſtomes, rentes, revenewes, tributes, and other eſcheates, and profits, for a long time ceaſe by the extreame povertie of the ſubiectes of Salamina, which did firſt ariſe vnto that countrie by reaſon of their ſeverall factions? as it may appeare by the ſtatute of Captaineſhip, where it is declared, that in the time of iuſtice declination, the Lords and chiefetaines fell into much ſtrife for greatneſſe of rule and governement, by reaſon whereof they drewe vnto them other inferiour ſtates to be of their ſeverall factions, vvhereby the countrie was drawen into that povertie, as for a long time, all rentes, revenewes, and other profits there ceaſed, and more then that, a newe charge and trouble did growe vnto Athens for the appeaſing of thoſe diſorders. Againe, the honour of well governing and commaunding is hereby loſt, which is a ſecond miſchiefe that ariſeth vnto vs herein; for ob diſcordias civium

aceidit, vt vnius imperio non pareant, ſed in diverſas partes diviſaregio nullis principibus parere cogatur. All which did ſometimes lively appeare in Salamina, when as the Lordes and chiefetaines of that land, by drawing all other inferiour ſtates vnto their ſeverall factions, did thereby withdraw the feare, obedience,Act. of captainſhip. 11.

                      and attendance of the ſubiect of Salamina, due vnto the ſtate of Athens, and wholy converted the ſame vnto themſelves, as in the ſtatute of Captainſhip more at large may appeare. Thirdly by factions and diſcordes there groweth a neglect of al publike affaires; for it is truely ſaide, that in the civill diſcords of the Florentines, no man having a ſound care of the affaires publike, & many of the principal citizens being ſuſpected, either to frēd the Medices, or mē that deſired an other forme of governement, things were overruled more with confuſion then with counſel. Laſtly, greater miſchiefe then any before remembred, ariſeth by factions and diſcordes; for in ſuch caſes a third perſon ſhall eaſily atchieve vnto the principallity, & ſuppreſſe either faction at his pleaſure; for ſo Clearchus by the aſsiſtance of the faction of the nobility, was inabled to hold the place & kingdome, as wel againſt the people as nobles, which were then the two factions that raigned & diſturbed the politike body: & it is alſo ſaid, the particular factions of the citizēs of Millaine drawing to privat counſels, did immediatly conſpire & take armes againſt Lodowicke Sforce, in ſuch ſort, as he was forced thereby to make his preſent departure with his wife & childrē, at which inſtant the citizens of Millain with francke & ready goodwil received the enemy: & have not ſeveral factions of Salamina, offred thēſelves with frācke & ready goodwill to receive the enemy? hath not Iames ſometimes Earle of Deſmond ſent vnto the french king, & by al means excited & provoked him to ſend an army for the invading of Salamina, the which conſpiracy did not then take his deſired effect, by reaſon of a peace thē immediatly cōcluded betwixt King H. the 8. & the french King? againe being fruſtate of that hope, hath he not many waies provoked the emperour, to ſend an army for the invading & poſſeſsing of Salamina? in like maner hath not Thomas Fitz Garrald addreſſed his letters vnto the Biſhop of Rome, as alſo vnto the Emperor, by one Gale in Granyll, otherwiſe called Charles Raynold Archdeacon of Kelles,
                     
for the invading of Salamina?Act. 28. H. 8. cap. 1.
                      all which in the act of the attainder more at large may appeare. And hath not Oneile, who by ſufferaunce and tollerance, long ſupported his faction againſt the ſtate, ſometimes addreſſed his letters vnto ſeveral forraine Princes, for the drawing in of ſtraungers to invade and poſſeſſe Salamina, the which vvere publikely intercepted by the Lorde Deputie? &c. All vvhich may evidently appeare in the ſtatutes of his attainder. Againe did not the faction of the ancient Brittains lay open a gap vnto Caeſar his invaſion, and did hee not by the aide of one faction of the Gaules ſubdue the reſt, and them alſo in the end? Was not the Duke ſometimes of 
                        Ʋalentinois, emboldened to invade the dominion of the Florentines, with a weake and ſlender armie, by the feare, ſuſpition, and great diſagreement, that then poſſeſſed them, for that he had in his army Vitellozze, and the Vrſins, and for that alſo Peter de Medicis was abiding at Loiana in the countrie of Bollognia at his direction? for it is ſaide that hee did entertaine Peter de Medicis, Ʋitellie, and the 
                        Ʋrſins, not vvith a minde or deſire to advaunce them, for nothing more then that could be farther from his thoughtes, but to augment the mutinies and diſagreementes of the Florentines, by the vvhich he hoped to vrge them either to better conditions, or be able to occupy ſome place of importance in their iuriſdiction. And did not the Megarians during the vproares raiſed by the ſeverall factions then maintained by the iſſue of Cylon, and the ofſpring of Megacles, take from vs the haven of Nyſea, and the ile of Salamina? then vvee may rightly conclude, that ſo long as vve have an enemy, vvhich raiſeth himſelfe againſt vs, ſo long we ought for the ſafetie of the whole, ſtrongly to ſuppreſſe all factions vvhatſoever: for factions breede an vnſetled minde in the people, and doth nouriſh this deſire of chaunge and alteration; the vvhich did livelie appeare in the people of Athens, during the continuance of the ſeverall factions, then entertained betwixt the people of the valley, ſea-coſt, & mountaine; for not withſtanding they al kept & obſerved the laws made by you Solon, for their reformatiō, yet there was none founde but gaped for a change, and deſired to ſee thinges in another ſtate, either parties hoping their condition & ſtate of life

would amend by chaunge, and that every of them ſhould be better then their adverſaries. There remaineth now that vve deduct colonies, which is the laſt, but not the leaſt meanes to ſuppreſſe this diſtemperature, vvhich of all others is the moſt beneficiall for the cōtaining of a nation conquered in their duty and obedience; wherein foure matters are worthily conſidered: firſt the neceſſitie of deducting colonies; ſecondarily the benefite that redoundeth thereby vnto common-weales; thirdly what order and manner in deducting colonies is to bee vſed and obſerved; laſtly, the impedimentes which are vſuallie given vnto the deducting of colonies.

Now then if we be willing to caſt of our former and manifolde troubles, if we be deſirous to diſmiſſe our ſelves of theſe infinite and perpetuall charges, and laſtly if we indevour to be ſtrong againſt the invaders, and ſuch as ſhall contend to occupie Salamina by force, let vs looſe no opportunity of deducting of colonies, for they be deducted and maintained with ſmall or no charges, & with no great offence, but onely to ſuch whoſe landes and houſes they poſſeſſe, the which remaine for the moſt part pacified, in that they enioy their life which ſtoode in the handes of the Prince, as vvell as

Againe, being thus deducted with ſmall or no diſcontentment, and maintained with far leſſe charge, they bee founde alſo more faithfull and ſtoute defendours of the confines of the country then garriſons, and therefore it is ſaide by a man of great vnderſtanding, Si reges noſtri capto Ludovico 12. rege Inſubriae, Colonias eo miſiſſent, vt quondam Celtarum reges feciſſe dicuntur, Inſubria a Francorum ditione ac poteſtate non tam facile defeciſſet: nec vero Hispani praeſidijs militaribus nulla Colonia deducta perpetuum eius regionis imperium tuebuntur, ſed ab imperio ſubditi arrepta occaſione deſciſcant oportet; non aliter quam Belgae, quos iam pridem colonijs Hispanorum ad imperium retinendum coniungi neceſſe fuiſſet, quoniam nec vlla vis diuturna eſſe poteſt, & peſſimus diuturnitatis cuſtos eſt metus: in like manner Salamina notvvithſtanding the ſtrength of garriſons, doth daily take all occaſions of declining, but in former times, after colonies were deducted, then Salamina continued for many ages in their obedience, in ſuch ſorte, as none durſt beare vppe heade, but lived as vaſſals and obedient people, vntill partly by the iniquity of the times, partly by our domeſticall factions, and laſtly by a negligence and ſecurity then found in theſe colonies, they were overthrowne and expelled by the native borne people of that lande, all which in the act of attainder of Shane Oneile more at large may appeare, as alſo in the ſtatutes of Abſentes.

                  In the order and manner of deducting collonies, certaine rules are to bee obſerved: firſt that the lands be ſo devided, as ſtrengths by great numbers may be deducted, and therefore Duo cui

                           que
                         attribuit. The Romaines laboured to deduct colonies by great numbers, eſpecially out of the confines of Italy, to the ende that by the proper ſtrength and forces of colonies, they might eaſilie defende the confines of their dominions, and ſuppreſſe al ſuch as were founde deſirous of innovation. Secondly we are to plant and place our colonies in the moſt rich and fruitfull landes, 
                        Ʋt in eo civibus numero auctis alimenta ſuppetant, potentia

                         auctae huiuſmodi novae vrbes, omnem internam vim propulſare atque etiam opprimere queant. Thirdly, ſuch as are to be deducted in the number of colonies, we ſhall wiſely make them but proprietaries of the landes, during life onely, Vt fructuarij occaſu fructus in aerarium cogerentur, quoad principis beneficio alius ſuccederet, quemadmodum Amurates cum Timariolis egit: by vvhich conſtitution three matters beneficiall to the weale publicke ſhall ariſe; firſt opportunity ſhall be lent from time to time, to recompence ſervitours by theſe caſuall profites that ſhall ariſe, without impoſing any newe charge vpon the common-weale; ſecondly by the death of this tenaunt for life, the profites thereof growe vnto the prince vntill the landes be newly diſpoſed by him; thirdly, the prince or ſtate being to diſpoſe theſe landes at his or their pleaſure, ſhall with this rewarde binde the proprietarie of the lande during life, in all ſervices to be loyall and faithfull; laſtly, by holding this courſe, ſundrie inconveniences ſhall be eſchewed which vſually followe ſuch as graunte theſe landes in perpetuity; for in ſuch caſes they have beene founde in Salamina, eſpecially after two or three deſcentes, to inter-marry and foſter with the meere native people, and by that occaſion decline ſometimes from their obedience; at other times they are founde to make leaſes of their landes, or to make a grant over of their eſtates vnto ſuch as are not

well affected vnto the governement, to the overthrowe of themſelves and common-weale, as it may appeare in the ſtatute of Abſentes, where it is ſaide, that the colonies being poſſeſſed of their landes, did make leaſes of diverſe of their holdes and manners vnto the late Earle of Kildar attainted, by occaſion whereof the ſame came to the poſſeſſion of Thomas Fitz Garralde, his ſonne and heire, who intending a daungerous rebellion, was aided, aſsiſted, and maintained againſt the ſtate, by the inhabitants, & occupiers of the ſaide lande, ſo as the ſtate was compelled of force to ſende thither an army royall for the better ſuppreſsing of thoſe diſorders and rebellions; laſtly, theſe colonies muſt vnite and gather themſelves together into places of ſtrength, walled or intrenched for their better defence againſt ſodaine incurſions, and never be deſtitute of proviſion ſufficient for their defence: for ſuch of our auncient colonies in Salamina, which in times peaceable ſuffered their townes, holdes, and caſtles to decay, and neglected the mainteining of ſuch garriſons, as of right appertained vnto them to maintain, were in difficult times exiled, banniſhed, or put to the ſword, onely ſuch remained and prevailed, which with a collected power and ſtrength, did inhabite places walled or intrenched, and were not founde deſtitute of ſufficient proviſion for the wars, as it may more at large appeare in the act of Abſentes. Therefore of late daies two worthy Knightes, Sir Henry Walloppe Treaſurer, and Sir Nicholas Bagnole Knight Marſhall, being the principall perſonages of the late deducted colonies, for the better ſtrengthening of the confines of Salamina, have not diſperſed their forces but wiſely collected them into one place of ſtrength, vvhereby they have repelled from time to time, all internall forces or ſodaine incurſions.

                  The impediments are ſundry and diverſe: the firſt is given by ſuch as vſually oppoſe themſelves againſt all newe orders, for that they reape a benefite by the olde diſorders. The ſecond is equall with the firſt, and proceedeth from a generall incredulitie ingrafted in

all ſortes of perſons, which never yet have given affiance or confidence vnto newe attemptes, be they never ſo profitable. The thirde impediment ariſeth greater then the reſt, when the authours of theſe new orders, ſhall become faint defendors thereof, and ſhall give leave and waye to others, which give impediment thereunto. The laſt impediment is the great trouble and charge, which followeth ſuch as ſhall inhabite landes farre removed; with the conſideration whereof, the Romaine Cittizens were ſometimes withdrawen, and diſcouraged from the inhabiting of the lands removed out of the confines of Italy, and the ſame alſo doeth not a little withdraw the newe colonies from inhabiting Salamina: But Muhamedes the Emperour ſometimes of the Turkes, contēding to remove this impedimēt, Cui

Let then our ſecond reformation be like vnto the firſt, for Omne principium bonū aliquod ſpectabat:
