INNER-TEMPLE
MASQVE.
            Enter DOCTOR ALMANACKE comming from
the funerall of December, or the old yeere.
            
               I Haue ſeene the old yeere fairely buried,
               Good Gentleman he was, but toward his end
               Full of Diſeaſes, he kept no good Diet,
               He Lou'd a wench in Iune, (which we' count Vilde,
               And got the latter end of May with childe;
               That was his fault, and many an old yeere ſmels on't.
               How now? who's t'is? oh, one ath' Faſting-dayes
               That followed him to his graue;
               I know him by his gauntnes, his thin chitterlings,
               He would vndoe a Tripe-wiſe; Faſting-day!
               
               Why art ſo heauie?
            
            
               Faſt.
               Oh, ſweete Doctor Almanacke,
               
               I haue loſt a deare old Maſter, beſide Sir,
               I haue beene out of ſeruice, all this Kerſmas;
               
               No-body minds Faſting day, I haue ſcarce bin thought
vpon a' Fryday nights;
               And becauſe Kerſmas this yeere fell vpon't,
               
                  
The Frydayes haue beene euer ſince ſo proud
               They ſcorne my companie, the Butchers boyes
               At Temple-Barre, ſet their great Dogges vpon me,
               I dare not walke abroad, nor be ſeene yet,
               The very Poulters Girles throw rotten Egges at me,
               Nay Fiſhſtreete loues me, e'en but frō teeth outward,
               (The neereſt Kin I haue) lookes ſhye vpon me,
               As if t'ad forgot me, I met Plumporridge now,
               My big-ſwolne Enemie, hee's plumpe and luſtie,
               The onely man in place, ſweete Maſter Doctor,
               
               Preferre me to the New-Yeere, you can doo't.
            
            
               Doct.
               When can I doo't ſir? you muſt ſtay til Lent.
            
            
               Faſt.
               Till Lent, you kil my heart, ſweet M. Doctor,
Thruſt me into Candlemas Eue, I doe beſeech you.
            
            
               Doct.
               Away, Candlemas Eue will neuer beare
thee i' theſe dayes, 'tis ſo frampole, the Puritanes will
neuer yeeld to't.
               Enter Plumporridge.
               
            
            
               Faſt.

               Faſt.
               I, hee's ſure of wel-come; me thinkes hee
moues like one of the great Porridge Tubs, going to
the Counter.
            
            
               Plum.
               Oh killing cruel ſight, yonder's a Faſting day:
A leane ſpinie Raſcall with a Dogge in's belly, his
very Bowels barke with hunger; auaunt, thy Breath
ſtinkes, I doe not loue to meete thee faſting, thou art
nothing but wind, thy Stomack's full of Farts, as if
they had loſt their way, and thou made with the
wrong end vpward, like a Dutch Mawe, that diſcharges
ſtill into 'th Mouth!
            
            
               Faſt.
               Why thou whorſon Breakefaſt, Dinner,

Nuntions, Supper and Beuer, Celler, Hall, Kitchin,
and Wet-larder.
            
            
               Plum.
               Sweete Maſter Doctor, looke quickly vpon
his Water, that I may breake the Vrinall about his
pate.
            
            
               Doct.
               Nay friendſhip, friendſhip.
            
            
               Plum.
               Neuer Maſter Doctor, with any Faſtingday,
perſwade me not.
            
            Nor any thing belongs to Ember-weeke.
            
            And if I take againſt a thing, I'me ſtomackfull,
            I was borne an Anabaptist, a fell foe,
            To fiſh and Fridayes, Pig's my abſolute Sweetheart.
            And ſhall I wrong my Loue, and cleaue to Saltfiſh!
            Commit adulterie with an Egge and Butter?
            
               Doct.
               Well ſetting this apart, whoſe water's this ſir?
            
            
               Plum.
               On, thereby hangs a tale, my M. Kerſmaſſes.
               
               It is his water, ſir, hee's drawing on.
            
            
               Doct.
               
                  Kerſmas? why let me ſee,
               I ſaw him very luſtie a Twelfe-night.
               
            
            
               Plum.
               I, that's true, ſir, but then he tooke his bane,
               With chuſing King and Queene;
               Ha's made his Will already, here's the Copie.
            
            
               Doct.
               And what ha's he giuen away, let mee ſee,

               Plum.
               He could not giue away much, ſir, his children
haue ſo conſumed him before hand.

               My fathers death ſets the Spring backward i'me.
               For ioy and comfort yet, I'me now betweene
               Sorrow and ioy, the Winter and the Spring.

               A fooliſh Faſting-day,

               He ne're grew vp ſo tall with Faſting-dayes,
               
               I would not for the price of all my Almanacks;
               
               The Guard had tooke him there, they would ha beate
out his braines with Bombards.
               
               I bade him ſtay till Lent, and now he whimpers;
               He would to Rome forſooth, that's his laſt refuge,
               But would trie awhile,
               How well he ſhould be vſde in Lancaſhire.

               I, Ile beſworne for that.

               Thoſe were the Times, ſir,
               That made your Predeceſſors rich, and able

               Thoſe meales that once were ſau'd, haue ſtird, & lept,
               And bègot Baſtards, and they muſt be kept,
               Better keepe Faſting-dayes, your ſelfe may tell you,
               And for the profit of purſe, backe and belly?

conſiſting of theſe ſix Rude ones.
            Exeunt.

               Vpon the reuerend forme and face of Time!
               Me thought it appear'd ſorry, and went angry.

               A wonder there's ſo many.
               How theſe broke looſe, euery one ſtops their paſſage,
               And makes inquiry after 'em.
               This Farmer will not caſt his ſeed ith' ground
               Before he looke in Bretnor, there he finds
               Some word which hee hugs happily, as, Ply the Box,
               Make Hay betimes, It falls into thy Mouth.
               A punctuall Lady will not paint forſooth

               Although ſhe long for both, if the word be that day,
               Gape after Gudgins, or ſome fiſhing phraſe.
               A Scriueners Wife wil not intreat the Mony-maſter

            At which loud Muſicke heard the firſt Cloud
vaniſhing, Harmony is diſcouered
with her ſacred Quire.
            
               
                  
                     
                        The firſt Song.
                        
                           Har.
                           NEw-yeere, New-yeere! harke, harken to me,
                           I am ſent downe
                           To crowne,
                           Thy wiſhes, with me,
                           Thy faire deſires in Vertues Court are fil'de,
                           The goodneſſe of thy thought,
                           This bleſſed worke hath wrought,
                           
                              
Time ſhall be reconcilde:
                           Thy Spring ſhall in all ſweets abound,
                           Thy Sommer ſhall be cleere and ſound,

                           Thou ſhalt depart as white as Snow.
                           Then a ſecond Cloud vaniſhing, the Maſquers themſelues
diſcouered, ſitting in Arches of Clouds,
being nine in Number, Heroes Deified
for their Vertues.
                           The Song goes on.
                           Behold, behold, harke, harken to me,

            Then the Maſquers deſcending, ſet to their

                           To your owne Heroick Glorie.
                           May your three times thrice Bleſt Number

            Then they order themſelues for their ſecond
Dance, after which,
