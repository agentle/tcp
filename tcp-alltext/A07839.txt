            LONDON, Printed by Melchisedech Bradwood for Thomas Man. 
1603.
         
         
            
            
            TO THE RIGHT honourable Lord, IOHN, Earle of Marre.
            
            THere are two things discoursed of in this Treatise, which are of speciall consequence to this earthly life of man: the one is Prosperitie; the other is Righteousnesse. The first dependeth vpon Goods outward and bodily: the other vpon the Goodnesse & vertues of the minde. Where these concurre, there is the liueliest paterne which this neather world affoordeth, of true Felicitie: and these two, like children of one father, doesweetly embrace and kisse one another. 1. Prosperitie furthereth Righteousnesse: for, a man that is no way streightened or disturbed, is the more free and comfortable to the seruice of God. And Righteousnesse furthereth Prosperity: for They which seeke 
               Psal. 34. 10.
               
               the Lord, shall want nothing that is good. 2. Againe, Prosperitie beautifieth Righteousnesse: for a streight & right-vp tree, the taller it groweth, the more comely it is. And Righteousnesse beautifieth Prosperitie: for Pleasure is not comely for a foole: no, Nemesis 
               Pro. 19. 10. disdaineth the growing vp of the vnworthie. 3. Thirdly, Prosperitie perfecteth Righteousnesse: for how shall he minister iustice, that beareth no office? or shew mercie, that wanteth abilitie? or giue comfort, that is himselfe distressed? And Righteousnesse perfecteth Prosperitie: for What shall it profit 
               Matth. 16. 26. 
               a man, though he should winne the whole world, if he lose his own soule? 4. Lastly, there is no true Prosperitie without Righteousnesse: for, to liue in sinne, is with the Paganes To sit in darknesse, yea in the region and shadow 
               Matth. 4. 16. 
               of death. And where Righteousnesse is, there is true Prosperitie: for Godlines hath the promise of the life 
               1. Tim. 4. 8. 
               present, and of that which is to come.
            
            
               
Both of these (through Gods speciall mercie) doe accompanie your Lordship. Prosperous you are in your noble descent, your large reuenues, your loue in your countrey, your successe in affaires, & your speciall fauour with your Prince and ours. Righteous you are: not as free from sinne and infirmities, (so I should both flatter and blaspheme) but as redeemed from sinne by Christ with his blood, and iustified by the same Christ in his resurrection, and washed by the Spirit of Christ in the lauer of regeneration. To all which, your holy life and sincere loue to the Gospel, giue abundant testimony.
            Let it not therefore seeme strange vnto your Honor, if I (who long ago beheld and obserued your holinesse and religion) doe thus congratulate vnto you the continuance and daily increase of honor and reputation: for this my text teacheth me To reioice in the Prosperitie of the righteous.
            
            It pleased your L. not onely to know

me in Norwich almost twentie yeeres agoe, and to be there an Auditor of my Ministery; but also of your bounty often to call me to your table, and sometimes of your humilitie to visit my lodging. If now you vouchsafe to acknowledge me in London after so many yeres labours, and almost all my spirits spent in the seruice of the Church: I shall haue much more cause to reioice in your Prosperitie, who in this your heigth, giue me in my declining & languishing time some reputation with the Righteous.
            
            The God of heauen and earth grant grace vnto your Honor, so to imploy this Prosperitie of yours to the furthering, countenancing & perfecting of Righteousnesse: as your Righteousnesse may further, beautifie and perfect your Prosperity here & in the heauens, through Iesus Christ our Lord.
            
               
                  April. 13. 1603.

custome hath continued, and experience hath confirmed for trueth. The learned call Prouerbs, Parables, Adages, or Apophthegmes, 
                  Plutarch. Apoph.

Prouerbium. excellencie in speech, as starres in the skie, or diamonds in a crowne of golde. So, Prouerbes are lumina or ationis: they put a grace, and beautie vpon speaking. The Graecians call them 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : and so the Septuaginta intitle this booke: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : that is, sentences as common in vse, as is the high way to all passengers. A Prouerbe is 
                  Basil. in princip. Prouerb. tom. 1. 
                  Verbumiuxta viam, (saith Basile:) A sentence common by euery waies side. The Latines call them Prouerbes, in the same sence, in which the Graecians terme them Parables: because Hieron. in Prouerb. 1. 
                  They are hidden and

darke and Hilarius in Psal. 127. 
                  yeeld not their sence according to the sound of their words: but in them Origen. Prolog. in Cant. Cantic. tom. 1. 
                  One thing is spoken, and an other thing is intended. And this is true in the most of humane, yea and in very many of these Diuine Prouerbes. Now such vsuall, such beautifull, such significant sentences, as custome hath made common, and experience hath confirmed for truthes: are those which are collected and compiled together in this treatise. Therefore should we be earnestly prouoked often to reade, carefully to learne, and highly to esteeme this booke of the Prouerbes.
               
               They are called Salomons Prouerbes. So the text it selfe witnesseth Pro. 1. 1. in the title of the booke: and so all Origen prol. in Cant. Cantic. Theodoret. praef. in Cantica. Epiphan. de mensuris & ponderibus. Athanas. orat. 2. contra Arrianos. August. de ciuit. Dei. lib. 17. cap. 20. antiquity hath receiued them without controuersie. And yet it is manifest that al the Prouerbs in this booke were not Salomons. For the 30. chapter conteineth Pro. 30. 1. 
                  The words of Agur, the sonne of Iaketh. But the whole

booke taketh his title and denomination from the greater and more principall part: as doe also many other things both in ciuile and naturall knowledge. Neither are they called Salomons Prouerbes, because it is certaine that he himselfe with his owne penne compiled this booke. For R. Mose 
                        〈◊〉
                     . some ascribe the penning of it to the Prophet Esaie: and Talm

                     rcer in Pro. 1. 1. collected at diuers times by seuerall persons, partly from his mouth, and partly from his writings, vnto the 25. chapter: and from thence forward Pro. 25. 1. by the seruants of Hezechias: as the title of the chapter (being a part of the Canonicall text) doth plainly auouch. But whosoeuer were the writer of this booke, or the collector of these sentences; it is manifest that

                  Salomon himselfe was the authour of them: from his fountaine they sprang, and from his words or writings they were deduced. So the wise and holy Author commendeth also vnto vs, the worthinesse of this booke.
               As touching the contents of this booke: some thinke that Gregor. Nissenus in Cant. the doctrine thereof is directed onely (or specially) vnto the yonger sort, Hieron ad Paulum & Eustochium. Comment. in Ecclesiast. because he often calleth him his sonne, to whom he maketh his speech. But who knoweth not, that it well enough becommeth the ancientest man, both to be, and to be called The sonne of wisdome? And besides, he that studiously conuerseth in this booke, shall finde euere where in it, able instruction for the ancient. There be others that referre the argument of this booke almost wholy vnto manners. They say that Theodores. Praefat. in Cant. Canticorum. it containeth profitable doctrine of maners; and that it is Basil. in princ. Prou. 1. An instructer of maners, and a corrector

of corrupt affections: And Saint Augustine saith August in ficculo. ex Pron. 
                  Liber prouerbiorum ad mores pios informandos penè totus valebit: Almost all the whole booke of the prouerbs tendeth to the composing of godly maners. Now, trueth it is, that very many sentences in this treatise doe concerne maners, and outward cariage to men: but not all, nor almost all. For diuers there are tending to the feare of God, to the loue of God, to faith in God, to patience vnder the hand of God, to a religious worshipping of God: all which can hardly be said to be doctrines of manners, vnlesse you meane that they concerne our mannerly and holy cariage of our selues outwardly and inwardly towards the maiesty of God. Therefore may this booke be called A Christian Quodlibet: for it hath Prouerbes almost of euery argument: or A Synopsis Theologiae: for The english Praeface to the Prouerbes. the summe and effect of the whole Scriptures is heere set forth in briefe

sentences. It is an hiue fraught with sweet hony gathered from all kinde o
                     •…
                   flowers. It is a rich Apothecaries shoppe, in which are all kinde of delicates for pleasure, and of confections for diseases. For in it are precepts and aduertisements: some concerning God, & some concerning men: some belonging to the church, some to the common wealth: some to priuate, some to publicke callings: some to the wise, some to the ignorant: some to the olde, some to the yong. In a word it is Euseb. Hist. Eccles. lib. 4. cap. 21. a booke in the iudgement of Ireneus and all the company of the ancients, full of worthy and excellent wisdome, necessary for all men, of all estates and degrees whatsoeuer. So that, the notable matter contained therein, is a third argument to stirre vs vp to diligent reading and meditation thereof.
               This Pro. 11. 10. sentence Pro. 11. 10. is one of them which concerneth men, and the maners of men, and their affection

and estimation which they carry, on the one side to godly and religious, on the other side to wicked The scope of the text: and prophane persons. The honour and reputation of an honest man, is such, and so great, as that euery one reioiceth at his prosperity and preferment. So saith the former part of the Text: In the prosperity of the righteous the city reioiceth. But a vilde The 
                        〈◊〉
                      parts of the text. and bad man is so lothsome and despicable: that euerie man is glad to see him abased. So saith the latter part: But When the wicked perish, there is ioy. These are the two points of doctrine conteined in this Scripture.

                     In the prosperitie of the Righteous the citie reioiceth.
                  
                  TO the end that we may the 1 The exposition or interpretation of the words. more soundly and euidently deriue Doctrine and Exhortation from this sentence: it is requisit, that first we duly examine the sence and interpretation of the words.
                  
                     In the prosperitie.] The name of Prosperitie is of the common sort, applied to wealth and riches. Vulgare men hold no man prosperous, but him that floweth with worldly abundance. But the word comprehendeth more largely, all things which tend to the profit and comfort of a mans outward estate. As, Health, Peace, Libertie, Credit, Friends, Long life, cheerfulnesse of heart, good successe in businesse: but especially in this place, Dignitie, Honour, Office, and Praeferment:
                     
all these are comprehended vnder the name of Prosperity. So largely is it taken else where in this booke, Prou. 1. 32. 
                     The prosperity of fooles destroieth them: that is, ease, security, abundance and pleasure, doe so lull men on sleepe in their folly; as they neuer thinke of seeking after wisedome, and so at last come to destruction. Againe, in that place of the Psalme 
                     Psa. 118. 25. 
                     O Lord saue now, O Lord now send Prosperity: Dauid praieth not only for the welth of the church, no nor for that especially, as for the greatest or onely happinesse. For wealth many times hindereth the Church, by Math. 13. 22. choaking the worde and making it vnprofitable. Whereof one of the Fathers pronounced, G. Nazianz. epist. 50. 
                     Calamitatem prosperitate meliorem esse: That calamitie was better then prosperity. But in those words of the Psalme, he praieth also for the peace of the Church, for the libertie of the Church, for the increase of the Church, for the

good successe of the Churches affaires, for the continuance of the Church, for the beautie and honour of the Church, and such like: and all them he comprehendeth vnder the name of Prosperitie. So in this place: In the prosperity] that is, in the health, peace, welfare, comfort, credit, successe, but specially in the dignity and preferment of a righteous man, the citie reioiceth. Therefore some of the Latine Interpreters, translate it here Vatablus Mercer. Foelicitas est bonum ex omni

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : and most of the Latines following them, Chald. paraphrast.

                        ater. Tremellius. Castalio. 
                     In bonis instorum: In the goods of the righteous. Not meaning onely thereby their goods and chattels, (as wee speake at the common lawe,) that is, their riches and moueables: but generally any good thing which betideth an honest

man. In the good things: that is, in any good thing which befalleth a vertuous or religious man, those which are vertuous and religious will exult and reioice. So much for the name of Prosperity.
                  
                  
                     Of the Righteous.] A righteous man is not heere taken for one perfectly righteous, or that hath no vnrighteousnesse in him. For in that sence Rom. 3. 10. 
                     There is none righteous, no not one. Iam. 3. 2. In many things we sinne all. No: August. Bonifacio. epist. 50. 
                     Iustus & iustificans non est nisi Deus: to speake exactly and properly, There is none that is iust himselfe, or is a Iustifier of others but onely God. But they are euery where in Scripture called Righteous men, which 
                     Caluin. in Psal. 5. 13. 
                     breathe after righteousnes: which 
                     Musculus in Gen. 6. 9. 
                     are studious of righteousnesse: which 
                     Cyrill. lib. 3. tom. 3. in Esai, 33. 
                     practise the workes of righteousnesse: which 
                     Bernhard. epist. 107. 
                     loue God the fountaine of righteousnesse: in a word 
                     August. de perfectione iustitiae. tom. 7. 
                     Qui perfectioni iustitiae plurimùm

accessit: Which hath attained to some good measure of perfection in righteousnesse. So 
                     Caluin. Harmonia Luc. 1. 6. 
                     they are righteous men which frame their liues according to the commandements of the law of God. In this sence is it that 2. Pet. 2. 7. 
                     Lot is called a righteous man: and yet he is tainted with Gen. 19. 35. adultery, and incest. Iob was Iob. 1. 1. an vpright and iust man: yet he brake forth Iob. 3. 1. into tearmes of impatience. Zacharias and Elisabet 
                     Luc. 1. 6. 20. 
                     were both iust before God: yet the man was s
                        •…
                     itten with dumbnesse for his infidility. And so all are righteous men before God, that loue him and keepe his commandements: God accepting their good indeuours in Christ, and imputing vnto them for perfection, the perfect Righteousnesse of Christ: for Basil. lib. de poenit. tom. 1. 
                     Nos ex iustitiae participatione iusti sumus: We are not otherwise exactly iust before God, then by the participation of the exact iustice and obedience of the Lord

Iesus Christ. Of such righteous men, Salomon speaketh heere: and saith, that in the welfare of one who walketh religiously to God, and honestly towards men, others that behold it are glad and reioice. So much for the title of a righteous man.
                  
                     The city.] The name of a city comprehendeth heere a double Rhetoricall Trope. 1. For first, the citty it selfe is taken for the people and inhabitants of the citty: as it is also else where in the scriptures. When tidings came to Shiloh, that Hophni and Phinehas were slaine, and the arke of God was taken of the Philistims, 
                     1. Sam. 4. 13. 
                     all the citty (that is, all the people of the citty) cried out. Againe: Psal. 46. 4. 
                     There is a riuer whose streames shall make glad the citty of God: that is, the people or inhabitants of the city of God. 2. Secondly, the citty is heere specified by name for the whole body of the country. For Salomon intendeth

to say, that all men, towne and country reioice in an honest mans preferment. When the Psalmist saith, Psal. 127. 1. 
                     Except the Lord keepe the citty, the keeper watcheth in vaine. There he speaketh Marl. in Psal. 127. 1. 
                     de reipublicae statu & politia: of the state and pollicie of the common wealth: and the name of a citty is taken Illiric. clauis Script. Ciuitas. 
                     Pro omni robore regiminis: for the whole strength of gouernment in a state or kingdome. So heere: when Salomon saith, The citty reioiceth: he meaneth that the whole body of the people is glad. But he specifieth the Citie by name; first, because cities are the speciall parts of a countrey, and commonly conteine vnder their iurisdiction the neighbour villages. Secondly, because Cities are the seats of great men and great offices: so as if a good man be preferred to dignitie, they do soonest espie it, yea and soonest feele the benefit of it, and therefore haue the first and chiefest cause

to reioice therein. Thirdly, Cities are the ciuillest and fullest of knowledge, and therefore doe not onely best discerne who is a Righteous man: but also are easiliest mooued to reioice in his Prosperitie. So, The Citie reioyceth: that is, euery man is well pleased with it.
                  Prouided alwaies, that this Citie and countrey be such an one as is it selfe a louer of Righteousnesse: such a Citie as Ierusalem was, and such a people as the kingdome of Israel was in the best times of Salomon: to the examplar whereof he hath speciall respect in this and diuers other of the Prouerbs. For if it be not such a Citte or people, they will hardly reioice in the prosperitie of the Righteous. It must not be such a Citie as Sodome was, where Gen. 13. 13. 
                     The men were wicked, and exceeding sinners before the Lord. For there, they Gen. 19. 9. disdained that Lot should aduise them, much more that

he should be exalted among them. Neither must it be such a Citie as the yoong man in the Comoedie describeth Athens in that time:

That is: Where the people grow daily worse and worse: where a man cannot know his friend and his foe asunder: nor holde his owne with quietnesse. For in such a Citie there is little care to preferre the best, and little ioy in their preferment. But in a citie or countrey well framed, well gouerned, well affected to religion and honestie: In such a citie there is much ioy at the Prosperitie of the Righteous.
                  
                  Hitherto the meaning and exposition 2 Examples▪ this doctrin of the words. Now, the doctrine it selfe which the words import,

is a trueth warranted by all experience: and whereof both holy writ and humane histories yeeld infinite examples. But I must be contented with one or two of either sort, in stead of many that might be alledged. When Dauids gonernment was disturbed by Absaloms treason, and the king fledde out of Ierusalem for feare it should be sacked or fired, 2. Sam. 15. 30. 
                     all the people that was with him, had euery man his head couered, and wept as they went. So sory they were for Dauids affliction. But when Absolom was slaine, and his father was to returne againe with honour: then happy was he that could shew greatest forwardnesse in his conduction: yea, 2. Sam. 19. 41. the men of Israell chode and brauled with the men of Iudah for preuenting them secretly in the kings restitution. So ioifull they were in his new recouered prosperity. Againe. When Adoniah contrary to Dauids minde

and promise, aspired to the kingdome of Israel: then Zadok, and Nathan, and Benaiah, and Shimei, and Rei, and the men of might 1. Reg. 1. 8. as they were excluded, so no doubt they hong their heads and sorrowed. But when Salomon was crowned at his fathers appointment, then not onely those good men 1. Reg. 1. 38. 40. accompanied him, but also All the people came vp after him, pipingand reioicing with great ioy, so that the earth rang with the sound of them. Salomon was a prince of incredible hope: and the land reioiced vnspeakably at his coronation. In humane histories the example is most famous of Numa Pompilius, the successor to Romulus in his kingdome. Because he was held a deuout and religious man (though indeed the old fables make him but Arnobius cont. gentes lib. 5. a beguiler of the Gods, and all his deuotions were but deuises Tertul. Apoi cap. 25. of curious superstitions, as Tertullian speaketh:) yea

and besides his religion, for that he was Pistarch. Numa. 
                     naturally disposed to all vertuous manners, and discipline, and paines taking, and study of wisdome: therefore after long dissention betweene the Romanes and the Sabines about the election of a king, he was named of the one side, and receiued of the other side with generall approbation: The Senate and people going forth to meet him, the women applauding him with their acclamations, and also reioicing, tanquam non rex vrbi, sed regnum obtigisse

                      (saith Plutarch,) as if they had that day gained not a new king, but an other kingdome to their citty. But why roue I so long and so farre from home? who remembreth not the ioy and thanksgiuing of the good seruants of God in our daies, for the preseruing of some Christians (though not many) from that blody massacre in France: for the deliuery of Rochel from the Spaniard: for the

reliefe of Geneua from the Sauoian: and infinite such examples to long to repeate? One president there is tending directly to this purpose, which my duty to God and men will not suffer me to omit. Seneca saith: Sen. debeueficiis. 
                     Gratum hominem beneficium semper delectat, ingratum semel. If we English men be truely thankefull, we will remember this benefit and mercy of God for euer. Our late Soueraigne Lady Queene Elisabeth was so worthy an instrument vnto vs of such speciall benefits, as we were not onely bound to be infinitly thankefull vnto her while she liued: but also we are still bound to keepe an honorable remembrance of her and her gouernment for euer: Pro. 10. 7. 
                     The memoriall of the iust shall be blessed. Remember we now to her eternall fame what ioy all the citties, yea the whole realme of England shewed at her first entrie vpon that high Prosperity, the scepter

and diademe of the kingdome which ioy arose from the hope and liking of her Righteousnesse. Her father (King Henry the Eight) had made some entrance to the Gospell, and wounded deepely the heary scalpe of Antichrist: and master Foxe recordeth it to posterity, Fo

of Queene Mary. So that in the opinion of all that saw and knew her, she had the estimation of a wise, learned, vertuous, and religious Princesse. Heere of it came to passe, that vpon her sisters decease, she was proclaimed successor to the crowne, not onely Caluin. epist. & resp. p. 214. 
                     summo consensu omnium ordinum, with a full consent of all estates (as Peter Martyr wrote to Master Caluine, vpon the report of the Ambassadors that came to Tigure out of England:) but also this consent was witnessed M. Fox. Act. & Mon.

                  Now we may not holde it strange, 3 Reasons of this doctrine.
                     
to see this so often and vsually fall out in practise: for there are many reasons inducing thereunto. 1. As first, where good men prosper, there commonly good causes, they thriue and prosper also: the glory of God is aduanced, the law of God is obserued, the kingdome of God is inlarged. When Hezekiah came to the crown of Iudah, 
                     2. Reg. 18. 4. 
                     He tooke away the high places, and brake the images, and cut downe the groues, and spoiled the brasen serpent: that is, He rooted out all idolatrous and superstitious worship. And the Ecclesiasticall Histories euerie where make relation, how when the holy Emperours Constantine, Theodosius, Iustinian and the rest of the same stampe sate in the throne of gouernment, then the true religion of Christ was authorised and dilated. Now, when others shall see that by the fauour, office, or abilitie of good men, God is honoured, righteousnesse is

practised, Christ is enterteined: if they haue any loue of God or goodnesse in themselues, they can not but reioice at a good mans prosperitie. 2. Secondly, the aduancement of the Righteous is a publike benefit: for they know right well, that Plato. Non nobis solum nati. 
                     they are not borne only for themselues: and that Rom. 12. 10. 
                     brotherly loue is required of them: and that Arist. topic. 
                     a good thing, the commoner it is, the better it is. And therefore they striue to liue, not wholly to their owne priuate profit and pleasure, but to the common vse and benefit of others. When Salomon was newly inuested in the kingdome of Israel, and the Lord offered to giue whatsoeuer he would aske: 1. Reg. 3. 9. 
                     he asked not for himselfe long life, nor riches, nor auenge on his enemies (which notwithstanding were things of great consequence to his owne estate:) but he asked an vnderstanding heart, which might inable him to gouerne with peace and righteousnesse,

to the publike good of the people of God. Gen. 47. 14. 
                     Ioseph being raised to authoritie in Aegypt, made not the peoples want a prey to gorge himselfe withall: but he applied himselfe to feed the Commons in the famine, and to enlarge the reuenues and soueraintie of the crowne. The Apostles in their office and function sought not their owne praise, nor ease, nor wealth: but the ioyning of others to Christ. 2. Cor. 12. 14. 
                     Non vestra, sed vos: I seeke not yours but you, saith S. Paul to the Corinthians. In a word: Menander. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : An honess man is helpefull at euery turne. Now therefore, when men shall feele by experience, that the aduancement of honest persons, is as the setting vp of a common light for euery man to walke by: or as the digging of a common well, at which euery man may draw water: haue they not great, and iust and daily cause to reioice in such

mens Prosperitie? 3. Thirdly, when good men flourish, the wicked are cut off. 1. Reg. 15. 12. 13. 
                     Asa tooke away the Sodomites out of the land: yea, he put downe Maacha his mother also from her estate, because she had made an idoll in a groue. Now the destruction of the euill, being a Apoc. 19. 17 rich banquet, yea a Isai. 34. 6. sweet sacrifice to God: it can not be but a ioy and gladnesse of heart to the children of God. 4. Lastly, when Righteous men are preferred, then others that loue Righteousnesse grow vp, by and vnder them: as when the Sunne riseth, the flowers open themselues. Ester 8. 
                     Mordecaes exaltation by Ahashuerosh, wrought the preseruation of the Iewes from a common slaughter. And the comming of our late Q. Elisabeth to the crowne, was the releasing of the Protestants out of prison, and the recalling home of learned men from beyond the seas, and the confirming of poore Christians

in religion. So that (to conclude this point) when it shalbe wayed and considered, that by the rising vp of godly and religious men, God is honored, the cōmon good is furthered, the wicked are abased, and those that feare God are comforted: vnlesse a man be composed with Heraclytus onely to beholde what is amisse, that he may doe nothing but weepe; or haue put vpon him the person of Enuie herselfe, Vix
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         tenet lachrymas, quia nil lachrymabile cernit. Ouid. Metam. 2. 
                     which weepeth for griefe when others haue no griefe to weepe for: he can not but confesse that there is euery way great cause, why in the prosperitie of the Righteous, the Citie should reioice.
                  
                  Thus then examples doe teach vs 4 The vse of this doctrine. that alwaies it hath beene so: and manifolde reasons doe prooue that it ought to be so. Now let vs labour to draw home the benefit of this doctrine neerer to our selues by vse and application. And let vs consider what

we can adde to our holy knowledge or practise by this: that there is, yea, and that there ought to be Ioy in the Prosperitie of the Righteous.
                  
                  1. First it teacheth vs to be well assured, that the Righteous, that is, men which feare God and walke vprightly, haue due right and interest in Prosperitie: that is, in the helpes, comforts, and dignities of this life. For else, how could any good citizen of a well affected citie, reioice with a good conscience to behold his Prosperitie? Indeed if we will speake exactly and properly, the outward blessings of this world belong solely and onely of right to the children of God. For Heb. 1. 2. 
                     Christ is made the heire of all things: and therefore no man can haue interest in any thing: who is not a Coheire and Fellow heire with Christ. Insomuch that when any branch of Prosperitie betideth a Righteous man, there befalleth nothing to him but

his due. Tertul. de resurrect. carnis. 
                     Beneficus enim debet: The good God of his promise oweth it vnto him. Lactantius. 
                     Bonis quod benefit, debetur: We owe a good man all the good that we doe to him. But when a wicked man enioieth health, or libertie, or riches, or credit, or preferment, or any outward benefit: he is but an vsurper of it, and an intruder into it, and shall answere for the vniust possession of it in the day of iudgement. And therefore if common-wealths and churches were so conscionably and religiously carefull as they ought to be in bestowing their dignities and offices vpon those to whom onely by right they belong and appertaine, then should none atteine vnto them, but such as gaue testimonie of their Righteousnesse beforemen. And if the Persian monarch could say, that Cyrus: Plutarch. Apoph. 
                     No man was worthy to be a magistrate, qui non sit melior subditis, which did not in good parts excell his subiects: then in a Christian

gouernment, no man should be admitted to exceed the common sort in credite and authoritie, who shewed not himselfe more then a common person, in honestie and religion: yea, if Christian families were duly reformed and conformed according to the will of God, then that childe or seruant in the house, should be most countenanced and best preferred, who approoued himselfe best to be the child of God, and the seruant of the Lord great Master of the world. And this is an obseruation of much vse vnto diuers sorts of men. 1. For first, it prescribeth a rule to those, that haue power in their hands to raise vp others to Prosperitie. Namely, that Psal. 101. 6. 
                     their eies should be (with Dauid) vnto the faithfull of the land, to honour those with dignitie, whom God hath most honoured with grace: that so right going to the owners, all men of wisdome

might reioice. And if among the nations of old, those proued the great and mightie men of the world, Iustin hist. lib. 1. 
                     quos ad fastigium honoris non ambitio popularis, sed spectata inter bonos moderatio prouehebat; Who raised not themselues by popular ambition, but by their approoued moderation: then in these latter times, Christian Princes and Nobles, should haue speciall care to aduance them to preferment, not which aspire vnto it by popularitie, or flatterie, or briberie; but which shew themselues woorthy of it by their godlinesse and vertue.
                  2. Secondly, this detecteth the hypocrisie of the Friers and Monkes in Poperie, who when they assume their orders, reiect their patrimonie: as if wealth and religion, Prosperitie and Righteousnesse could not stand together. Much like are they to Aristippus, who in his trauell commanded his followers to cast away their treasure,—

                        
                        
                           Horat. lib. 2. sat. 3. Quòd tardiùs irent,
                        Propter onus segnes:
                     
As if their patrimonie hindered their passage to heauen. But to these a man may say, as Plato said to Diogenes: They despise the pride of the world alio fastu maiori, with a greater pride of their owne hearts: supposing merite in the worke, and affecting the applause of men. Therefore is that saying of Augustine notable against them August. epist. 34. 
                     Vtiliùs terrena opulentia tenetur humiliter, quàm superbè relinquitur. Earthly abundance is better held with humilitie, then relinquished of arrogancy. For a lowly man may doe much good with his riches: but a proud man is neuer the nearer to heauen for his pouerty. But let those slowe bellied Cretians goe.
                  3. There be some, who of very tendernesse of conscience, and for feare to displease God, dare not raise vp their outward estate, no

not when meanes are put into their hands; nor assume any office, no not when they are lawfully called thereunto: as supposing, that because their chiefe aime is to grow Spirituall men, therefore temporall Prosperity doth not belong vnto them. Now these men must remember that 1. Tim 4. 8. 
                     Godlinesse hath the promises of the life present: and that Deut. 28. 1. all outward felicity is prefixed for a reward to the keeping of Gods commandements. It holdeth not for a rule in the church, which Plato imagined to hold in the common wealth: Plato de leg. lib. 5. 
                     Diuites vehementer, & bonos fieri impossible est: it is impossible to be very rich and very vertuous. No: the examples of Abraham, and Lot, and Iob, and Dauid, and a thousand others are pregnant instances to the contrary. And our sauiour Christ doth not say, It is the prosperity of the world: but it is 
                     Matth. 13. 22. 
                     the care of this world that choketh the

word. 
                     Theoph. in Luc. 8. 14. 
                     Non enim diuitiae nocent, sed sollicitudines earum: Riches are not the things that hurt aman of themselues, but the immoderate and mistrustfull care taken about them. It is a notable exhortation which the Psalmist maketh: Psal. 62. 10. 
                     If riches increase, set not your hearts vpon them. He saith not, Refuse them, or reiect them: but set not your hearts vpon them. That is: August. in Psal. 61. 
                     Noli ibi te figere; make not them thy rest: or, Basil. in Psal. 61. 
                     Nolite illis vestram mentem submittere; subiect not your thoughts and affections vnto them. 
                     Chrysost. in Iohan. 
                     Vse riches as thy seruant, not as thy master: possesse them, and be not possessed of them: so maist thou glorifie God much, and exceedingly benefit the Church by thy aboundance.
                  4. This also serueth to reforme the corrupt iudgement of those, who if they see a religious gentleman to enlarge his reuenues by purchase, or a zealous painfull Minister to thriue

and grow rich, or an honest minded Commoner to attaine some office or preferment: by and by their friends feare their falling away from the Gospell; and their enemies the exclaime: See: heere is their religion, heere is the depth of their deuotion, &c. I warrant you these men that make so great profession, are as hungry of wealth, and as thirsty after preferment, as are the prophanest persons in the country. Nay, stay there▪ not so hungry, nor so thirsty by a great deale. For a worldly man maketh these things his God, and Ephes. 5. 5. Coloss. 3. 5. committeth idolatry with them, bestowing vpon them the chiefe loue, and ioy and confidence of his heart: whereas a godly man knoweth that he must 1. Cor. 7. 31. 
                     vse this world, as though he vsed it not; and that he must 
                     Matth. 6. 33. 
                     first seeke the kingdome of God and the righteousnesse thereof; and taketh these outward things as they are ministred

vnto him. Againe a worldly man hungreth and thirsteth so deepely after worldly things, as he will not sticke to attaine them perfas & nefas, by any vnlawfull meanes whatsoeuer: by stealth, robbery, oppression, extortion, vsury, bribery, flattery, periury, cousenage, and what not? Wheras a godly man feareth to touch such pitch, and holdeth onely that gained, which is lawfully gotten: and accounting 1. Tim. 6. 6. 
                     godlinesse great gaine, is contented with that he hath. So there is a great difference betweene a godly and vngodly mans course in the pursuite of worldly prosperity. But if God offer these things by lawfull meanes, they despise them not, nor they cast them not away: as did Hieronimus ad Paulinum epist. 13. 
                     Crates the Thebane, because non putauit seposse & vertutes & diuitias simul possidere: as if Righteousnesse and prosperity, wealth and godlinesse could not stand together.

No: they reiect them not, no more then Abraham or Lot cast away their cattell, or siluer, or gold, or seruants, or tents; in which Gen. 13. 2, 5, 9. notwithstanding they so abounded as the land could not beare them to dwell together: nor, no more then Gen. 41. 40. 
                     Ioseph refused his preferment in Aegypt, or Psal. 78. 70. 
                     Dauid to be called from a shepheard vnto the kingdome and throne of Israel. And indeed why should they? For Ambros. lib. 
                           •…
                        n Luc. 18. 
                     Diuitiae vt impedimenta sunt reprobis, ita bonis sunt adiument a virtutis: Riches to bad men are lets and hinderances; but to good men they are furtherers to vertue. Therefore they receiue them as things good in themselues, and giuen of the good God, and labour to imploie them to good vse: yea and knowing their interest in them by Christ, they reioice in them as in their lawfull inheritance: yea, lastly, other men knowing how due they are to the

godly, how woorthy they are of them, and how profitably they will bestow them, they also (as Salomon heere speaketh) reioice in the prosperitie of the righteous. So, let that be the first note.
                  2. Secondly, this Scripture may teach vs what a profitable and comfortable thing it is, to be a vertuous and religious man. Euery honest person will loue him, and like him, and wish him well, and ioy in his prosperitie. And no maruell: for, a good man is the image of God, who is most louely in himselfe, and most to be beloued of vs. One of the Heathen could say, that there was Cicer. de nat. deorum. lib. 1. 
                     Nihil amabilius virtute: Nothing more amiable or louely than vertue. Another, that Plato de leg. lib. 4. 
                     All the golde which is aboue the earth and vnder the earth, deserueth not to be compared with vertue. Another, that Plutarch. de cupiditate diuitiarum. tom. 2. all the beautie of Riches are but Phalarae, & bullae, ac

puerilia spectacula: Vaine shewes and childish delights, vnwoorthy to be compared with vertue. Another, that whereas the best things else in the world do want their ornaments; gold and siluer, their refiner; and precious stones, their polisher: Seneca lib. 9. epist. 67. 
                     Virtus nullo honest 
                           •…
                        mento eget: Vertue needeth no thing to adorne it. Ipsa & magnum sui decus est, & corpus suum consecrat: Shee herselfe is her owne glorious beautie, and honoureth the body which shee inhabiteth. Now, if the heathen men spake thus of their morall vertues, which caried but a shadow of goodnesse, and were in trueth but splendida peccata, beautifull sinnes (as Saint Augustine called them:) then Christians which haue the light of the worde, to reueale vnto them the true nature and dignitie of Spirituall graces, can not but account a vertuous and religious man very beautifull and honourable: and so of meere

loue reioice in his Prosperitie. Therefore may an honest man be well resembled to a Light. Saint Paule saith Phil. 2. 15. the Philippians did shine as lights in the world. And Iohn Baptist 
                     Ioh. 1. 7. 
                     is called A light. And Theophilact. in Ioh. 1. 
                     We may call eueryone of the Saints A light: though not lucem illam, 
                     Ioh. 1. 9. 
                     That light, which lighteneth euery man that commeth into the world: But pettie Lights they are, and rightly so accounted. For euen as the Lights because they are glittering and comfortable, therefore euery man is pleased to haue them set vp: so Righteous men, because they are beautifull and louely, therefore euery honest man is pleased to behold them lifted vp, and aduanced to preferment. Our Sauiour Christ resembleth his Spouse vnto a thicke Cant. 3. 6.

And euen as euery man draweth neere to him, and delighteth in his companie, that carieth sweet odours about him: so wheresoeuer a man liueth, that is endued with the graces of God, euery wise man will like his fellowship, and draw neere vnto him in affection; and of loue and liking reioice in his Prosperitie.
                  
                  Heereby therefore all men should be prouoked: that as they couet Prosperitie, so they should striue vnto

                     Righteousnesse. Which if they laboured for, then they should not onely the sooner

And ô that, ô that our times had wanted examples of some, who for their good parts growing into fauour with God and men, were not able to support their estate against the bloody dint of enuy! Well: wouldst thou fare better? wouldst thou both prosper, and be safe in thy Prosperity? Then to the desire of it, ioine the desire also of Righteousnesse. For 1. Pet. 3. 13. 
                     who is it, that will harme you, if yee follow that which is good? Feare God, worship him zealously and aright, walke lowly, honestly, iustly, and

louingly towards men: this is the readiest way to secure thine estate. For if thou be a Righteous man, the City will reioice in thy prosperity. Sometimes God turneth it otherwise, for he will be tied to no rule: but that it is commonly so, this Prouerbe of Salomon iustifieth in this place.

the Churches of Christ flourished in France, Germany, Scotland, Denmarke, Sweeueland, and else where? And when we shall vpon due inquisition or suruey, be giuen to vnderstand, that God prospereth any one good man particularly, or any company of good men generally: then not to enuy or maligne them, as Ester. 6. 12. 
                     Haman enuied Mordecaies fauour with the king, or as 1. Sam. 18. 8. 
                     Saule maligned Dauids reputation with the people, or as some in our time haue belched out reproches against the neighbour Churches and the worthy men that liued in them: but we should reioice with them, as affected with their good, and ioifully wish the continuance and increase of their Prosperity. If we know but one Gaius in a country, which is Rom. 16. 23. 
                     Paules host and the host of the church, we should wish to him as Saint Iohn wisheth to his Gaius:

                     Beloued, I wish chiefely that thou prosperedst

and faredst wel. If we see about vs an vpright minded man, which serueth not the time nor professeth religion onely for shew; but feareth God inwardly, and walketh in the honesty of his conscience: we should pray for him with the Psalmist: 
                     Psal. 125. 4. 
                     Doe well (ô Lord) to those that be good and true in their hearts. If we see any Church striuing to cast out Popery and to intertaine sincerity, we should pray for it and the fauourers of it: Psal. 122. 6. 
                     O pray for the peace of Ierusalem: let them prosper that loue thee. And certainly if we be true hearted Citizens of the holy city, new Ierusalem; we will not onely pray for it, and for all that doe belong vnto it: but also when any good betideth it or them which they needed and we praied for, we will be ready to reioice with them, and to praise God for them, according to this sentence of Solomon: In the prosperity of the righteous the city

reioiceth.

No honest man doubteth (I trow) to number her with the Righteous, who planted the word of Righteousnesse among vs, and susteined the intolerable malice of all Papists (enemies vnto Righteousnesse) & gouerned by Righteous lawes, and ministred right to men: yea lastly, was an harbour to all distressed Christians that fled hither from diuers places for Righteousnesse sake. I trust God hath heard the millions of holy praiers made for her while she liued, and hath giuen her a rich inheritance with the Righteous, and a large portion in that Christ, whose Gospell by her means had so free passage in the lande, and was glorified by the conuersion and saluation of so many thousands. But to the purpose. How Prosperous this Queene was in all her waies, the Papistes obserue with grinding their teeth: but we should applaud with clapping of hands. Farre vnlike was

her state to her sister Q. Marie: for of her M. Foxe recordeth, that Act. & Mon. in fine. R. M. 
                     nothing euer succeeded well which she tooke in hand. But of this we may auouch that Prosperitie of Iob: 
                     Iob. 29. 3. 
                     Gods light shined vpon her head, and Gods prouidence was vpon her tabernacle.

                     11. 
                     her; and euery eye that saw her, gaue testimony vnto her. From her youth she was reserued (as it were) to the Crowne, by want of issue in her brother and sister. All Queene Maries daies she was woonderfully preserued, euen by the meanes (as was thought) of that Philip of Spaine, who afterwards became her deadly enemie. Shee that then was ledde homely, tanquamouis, as a sheepe to the prison; was not long after attended magnificently, as a princely Lionesse to the scepter: and when shee was once setled in the throne, what

                     Prosperitie euer betided a Prince, wherewith her cup did not abundantly ouerflow? Tertullian describing the praiers which the old Christians of their loiall affections made for their heathen Gouernours, (wherein they were farre vnlike to the Popes and Papists of this time, which Bulla P ij. 5. Geneb. chron. proscribe kingdomes, and discarge subiectes of alleageance to their Soueraine Princes, and Defence of English Catholiques. cap. 5. hold it lawfull for the subiect to take vp armes against the king) saith on this wise in his Apologie: 
                     Tertull. Apol. cap. 30. 
                     We prate alwaies for all Emperours, that God would bestow vpon them a long life, a peaceable gouernment, a safe pallace; strong armies, faithfull counsailours, obedient subiects, a quiet world, and whatsoeuer else any man, yea Caesar himselfe can wish or desire. And is not this the Prosperity which by our praiers (as by one speciall meanes) God gaue and continued to Queene Elisabeth? For first,

shee attained a long life, euen within a yeere of that which Psal. 90. 10.

Her Proclamations were as strong as enacted lawes: and her Priuate letters as forceable as Publike proclamations. Seuenthly, the world was so quiet in her time, as England for 45. yeeres neuer knew by feeling, what belonged to the warres. And now her winding vp was in so quiet a season, as not onely her owne kingdomes were in a generall peace; but all the countries of Christiandome, in a calme vnity and concord.

                  1. One is, his holy and vertuous education, which the common Prouerbe calleth, An other nature.

Learned education is a great furtherance to vertue; yea, it is Plutarch. de Iiberis educandis. 
                     Primum, medium, & vltimum caput (as Plutarch speaketh:) as touching the neather meanes, it is all in all, to the leading of a godly and vertuous life. Therefore haue we great hope, that the sweet liquor wherewith he was seasoned in youth, will yeeld him an healthsome and sauourie relish all the dayes of his life.
                  2. A second is, the experience of his peaceable and mercifull gouernment in his owne countrey.

There they many times partaked my publique Ministery, and I their priuate exercises. I saw their cariage so graue, their speeches so seasonable, their praiers so deuout,

their preaching and preacher so sincere and zealous: as euer since that time (which is now about twentie yeeres agoe) I haue caried a reuerent remembrance, & honorable estimation of them and their profession.

                     Sergius Paulus desired to heare the word of God. But Elimas withstood them, and sought to turne away the Deputy from the faith. No maruell. For he was a Iewe and a Sorcerer: and therefore could neither beare the trueth, nor the holinesse of Christian Religion. So hath it alwaies beene in the world. Ammonites and Moabites, Iewes and Sorcerers, men of corrupt life and religion, could neuer take pleasure in the building of Ierusalem, nor in the propagating of the Gospell. Whereof it is that they haue alwaies maligned the rising vp of the Righteous, for feare that the worke of God should prosper in their hands.
                  Heere therefore learne we to iudge of what sort and qualitie those are

among vs, which grinde their teeth, and hang their heads at this new day of Englands Prosperitie. Of which ranke and company are the dingthrifts of the lande: who hauing wasted their owne goods with riotous liuing, hoped now to haue parted other mens stakes in the time of ciuill dissention: Those also which raised not themselues by their Righteousnesse, but climbed on high by symonie, by briberie, by flattery; abusing the gracious time and speciall ministers of the state, by corrupting and peruerting inferior officers: Those againe, which assumed the Magistracie, not to doe iustice, but to gaine reputation; and entered the ministerie, not to labour but to liue at ease; not to feed the slocke, but to feed vpon the flocke. These and diuerse others fearing lest in an alteratino their euill might come to light: as when a man remooueth his house,

many a thing is pulled out, that laie hid, while he was setled, in some dark corner: they can not but in apparance onely reioice at this prosperitie. But to omit these and some others: there are now two especiall sorts of male-contents in the land, that sigh at the heart, though they smile with their countenance at this common peace and ioy in the kingdome. The Lord giue his Maiestie grace prudently to discerne them, and puissantly to suppresse them, as enemies to God, and chiefe hinderances to the Gospell.
                  1. The one sort are the Atheists, I meane the Mocke-gods of our time, which make a scorne of all religion: and saie with the Psal. 53. 1. 
                     Foole in their hearts, There is no God. Of such grosse and senselesse Atheists I speake: not of such as the Papists make of the Protestants. For with them Laurent. de la Barre. in Tertul. de resar.

                     Erasmus is an Atheist, because

I now he imitated Lucians stile in deriding their absurdities. With them Idem in Tert. contra Valent. 
                     Caluine is an Atheist, because he maketh God the authour of all things. Not being able (seely schollers) to distinguish, between the actition which is euer Act. 17. 28. of God, and the euill of the action, which is euer of man himselfe. Againe, they say of Genebrard. Chron. p. 1171. 
                     Bukchennane that he was Atheus Poëta, a godlesse or Athetsticall Poet: because (perhaps) he compiled Dauids Psalmes in Poeticall verses. Yea in their esteeme, all of vs are little better then Atheists, because we acknowledge not euery seuerall Saint, for a petie God in religion. As the Cicer. de nat. Deorum. lib. 1.

                     consultè potius quàm prophanè disputantem: Who disputed rather aduisedly (like a Christian) than prophanely (like an Atheist.) So Arnobius iudgeth; and so I doe conceine him. For certainly his purpose was

neuer to say, There was no God: but that those were no gods which the Athenians worshipped: But of that by the way. Such fatte Atheists made the Gentiles of the Philosophers: and such Atheists make the Papists of vs: but of such I speake not in this place. The Atheists which I intend are those, to whom Religion is nothing but Policie, and the Scriptures are but Quaint deuices: and Moses his leading of the people through the red sea, was but his wisdome to finde the chanell, and to take the time when the tide was out: and such like odious blasphemies. These persons no man (I trow) can call Christians: and yet of themselues and their followers they are reputed deepely wise and learned. Let vs grant them therefore (if we grant them any thing) to be Heathen Philosophers: but then the question is, of what sort or sect they might take their denomination.

Verely Epicures they are, for they hunt after pleasure as after their chiefest good. Their Mote is like to Sardanapalus Epitaph:
                     
                        Ede, lude, bibe, charum praesentibus exple
                        Deliciis animum: post mortem nulla voluptas.
                     
                     Stoikes they are: for Plutarch. de repugnantijs Stoicorum. though they loue to dispute of Action and Practise, yet themselues couet to sit in ease and quietnesse. Yea in Plato de republicadial. 5. their affectation of Communitie, they are Academikes: for by their good willes no mans wife should be proper to her husband. But with the Peripatetians to enquire after Arist. Ethic. 
                     felicitie, or vertue; or to account the gifts of the mind, their most excellent parts; or the seeking of common good, their greatest glorie: these are tunes that sound harsh in their eares, because they sauour somewhat of Righteousnesse, Prosperitie, and pleasure, and

ease, and abundance, are things which they affect: but Vertue and Righteousnesse they affect not. These men seeing now a change euen in the Head; (for 1. Sam. 15. 17. 2. Chro. 20. 27 
                     Princes are the heads of the people) and knowing that Arist. Physic. 5. 
                     Mutation is an alteration in the same kinde into more or lesse (as the great Philosopher speaketh;) and discerning by all likelihood, that our Religion (through Gods infinite mercy) is not like to change to the lesse, but rather to the greater: they feare lest that which they concealed before, should now be discouered; and whereas they were noted in former time to haue but little Religion, now it will manifestly appeare that they haue none at all: therefore doe they but poorely and seelily (God knoweth) giue some single tokens of ioying in this our late Prosperitie.
                  
                  2. The second sort of Malecontented mates, are our mutinous and

seditious Papists; which neuer were, nor neuer will be true to Princes crownes. For they hold it for a Maxime, that Ioh. de Parisiis de potest. Regia & Papali. cap. 5. 
                     Papa est verus Dominus temporalium: The Pope is the right Lord of Temporalities; so as he may take from any man, that which is his owne. By which conclusion, no Prince shall euer be sure in his throne, but at the becke and good pleasure of the Pope of Rome. A notable seditious and rebellious doctrine. Now these men which hang on this string, shewed slender tokens of ioy when Queene Elisabeth came to the crowne: but lesser a great deale now at this late Proclamation. Some newe deuised Title which might haue interessed the Spaniard to our Dominions, would haue pleased them a great deale better: or some diuision among the Nobles and Commons of this land, would haue wrought them better aduantage. For their practise was

alwaies to fish in troubled waters: and to that end to raise vp diuision betweene Prince and people. But that all the estates of the land should conioine as one person, and set their faces all to the right: is a thing which they neuer expected, much lesse did wish to haue betided. But of them enough at this time. I trust that the Kings Maiestie who now is, knowing how dangerous their doctrine is to the estate of Magistracie, how they brought the late French King to his end, how many assaults and attempts they made vpon the kingdomes and person of the Queene his predecessor; and lastly, how they haue slandered his natiue realme of Scotland, auouching, that the Defence of English Catholiques. cap. 3. & 4. Treacheries, treasons, murders and villainies practised in that kingdome, arose from the Protestants: will in his princely wisdome take them as they are, and vse them as they deserue: causing all

the Saints of God to reioice, if not in their conuersion which were of vs to be wished, yet in their destruction which themselues will procure. Of which destruction of them, and other wicked persons, the latter pan of this Text ministreth due occasion to intreat: but time
