               MY Lady Pecunia
               
               is a faire creature,
               All cloathed in siluer,
               according to nature:
               She flieth most fréely,
               none doth await her,
               To wash off her pinions
               by counterfeit water.
               Oh this is a siluer age,
               Oh this is a changing age.
            
            
               The Lord and the Lady,
               the Begger the Knight,
               For Lady Pecunia
               
               cares not a Doi

                  :
               Redeemed from prison,
               she taketh delight,
               To goe to the Prodigall
               spender aright.
               Oh this is a siluer age,
               Oh this is a wasting age.
            
            
               Our lusty braue gallants
               now walkes among clownes
               With their full pockets
               well stored with crownes,
               To giue to poore people
               the rents of their grounds,
               Where almes of brasse forthings
               are changed to pounds.
               Oh this is a siluer age,
               Oh this is a bountifull age.
            
            
               The Merchant refuseth
               is gaine by aduenture,
               The Citizen leaueth
               to lend by Indenture.
               Young gallants grow carelesse
               their titles to enter,
               But put their whole liuings
               to'th stretch of the tenter.
               Oh this is a siluer age,
               Oh this is a liberall age.
            
            
               Rich mizers haue turned
               their gold to good cheare,
               And bids the poore begger
               most kindly draw nears:
               And with the fat gluttons,
               they spend away sheere,
               What greedinesse gained
               by fraud in ten yeares.
               Oh this is a siluer age,
               Oh this is a spending age.

               To raise vp the diuell,
               His mind to molest,
               But coniur'd by conscience,

               Oh this is a siluer age,
               Oh this is a mending age.
            
            
               Young women grow weary
               of walking the street,
               They scarce in a Tauerne,
               will set in their feet,
               Their husbands they feare not,
               with whom they doe meet,
               And like to good Angels
               they neuer doe fleet,
               Oh this is a siluer age,
               Oh this is a vertuous age.
            
            
               The bawd and the pander
               are turned to grace,
               And for a full pocket
               they hold it but base.
               A wench that is painted,
               comes not into place,
               For feare lest the beadle
               her shoulders vncase.
               Oh this is a siluer age,
               Oh this an honest age.

               And wait in the Tauerne,
               vntill they agree,
               Not taking one penny
               in lieu of their fee.
               Oh this is a siluer age,
               Oh this is a fauourable age.
            
            
               The honest true Hostler

               For feare of the Begger
               that stands at the doore.
               For quiet true concord,
               brings plentifull store.

               and turn'd from the Chamber,
               into the cold yard:
               And from all true good men,
               she well may be spar'd,
               When such an age changed,
               yet neuer was heard.
               Oh this is a siluer age,
               Oh this is a wondring age.
