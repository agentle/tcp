That is to ſaye / a man is ordeyned and borne to laboure? as a byrde is ordeyned to flye. And the apoſtle ſayth. Qui non laborat: non manducet: de bet enim in obſequio dei laborate / qui de bonis eius vult manducare. That is to ſaye. He that laboureth nat / ſholde nat eat / & he ought to labour & do goddes warke yt wyll ete of his goodes or gyftes / the whiche is an harde text after ye lytterall ſence. For by y• lettre the kynge / the quene / nor al other lordes ſpirituall & temporall ſholde nat eat / without they ſholde labour the whiche were vncomely / & nat cōuenyent for ſuch eſtates to labour.

            NOw the plowes be made of dyuerſe maners / it is neceſſary for an huſbande to knowe howe theſe plowes ſholde be tempered▪ to plowe and turne clene / & to make no reſt balkes. A reſt balke is where the plough byteth at the poynt of the culture & ſhare / and cutteth nat the grounde clene to the forowe that was plowed laſt before / but leueth a lytel rydge ſtan dynge bytwene / the which dothe brede thyſtyls and other wedes. All theſe maner of plowes ſholde haue all lyke one maner of temperynge in the yrens. How be it a man may temper for one thynge in two or thre places as for depnes. The fote is one / the ſettynge of the culture of a depnes is an other / & the thyrde is at y• ploughe tayle / where be two wedges y• be called ſlot
                  •
               
               
wedges / the one is the ſlote aboue the beame / an other in the ſayde ſlote vnder the ploughe beame / and other whyle he wyll ſet bothe aboue or bothe vndernethe / but alway let hym take good hede & kepe one generall rule of the hynder ende of the ſharebeame do alwaye touch the erth / that it may kyll a worde / or els it goth not truly. The temperynge to go brode & narow is in the ſettynge of the culture & with the dryuynge of his ſyde wedges / fore wedge / & hele wedge / which wolde be made of drye wode / & alſo y• ſettyng on of his ſhare helpeth well / & is a connynge poynt of huſbandrye / & mendeth and payreth moche plowyng / but it is ſo narow a poynt to know that it is harde to make a man to vnderſtande it by wrytynge without he were at y• operacyon therof to teche mē the practyue / for it muſt leane moche into the forowe / and the poynt may not ſtande to moche vp nor downe / nor to moche in to the lande nor into the forow. How beit the ſettyng of the culture helpeth moche. Some plowes haue a bende of yren tryanglewyſe ſet there as the plough eare ſhold be that hathe thre nyckes on y• farther ſyde. And yf he wyll haue his ploughe to goo a narowe forowe / as a ſede forow ſholde be / than be ſetteth his fote teame in the nycke next to the plough beame / and yf he wyll go a mean brede / he ſettyth it in the mydle nycke that is beſt for ſturrynge / and yf he wold go a brode forow / he ſertyth it in the vttermoſte nycke / that is beſt for falowynge. The which is a good way to kepe the brede and ſone tempered / but it ſerueth not the depnes. And ſom men haue in ſtede of y• ploughe fote a pece of yron ſet vp ryght in the farther ende of the plough beame / ▪
               
and they call it a coke / made with two or thre nyckes and that ſerueth for depnes. The ploughes that goo with wheles haue a ſtreyght beame / & may be tempered in the yron as the other be for the brede / but theyr mooſt ſpecyall temper is at the bolſter / where as the ploughe beame lyeth / & that ſerueth both for depenes and for brede. And they be good on euen ground that lyeth lyghte / but me ſemeth they be ferre more coſtlye than the other plowes. And thoughe theſe plowes be well tempred for one maner of grounde / that temper wyll not ſerue in an other maner of grounde / but it muſt reſt in the dyſcreſſyon of the huſbande to knowe whan it gothe well.
         
         
            ¶ The neceſſary thynges that belongeth to a plowe / carte / & wayne.
            BUt or he begynne to plowe he muſte haue his plough & his ploughe yren / his oxen or horſes / and the gete that belongeth to theym / that is to ſaye / bowes / yokes / landes / ſtilkynges / wrethyng temes. And or he ſhall lode his corne he muſt haue a wayne / a copyoke / a payre of ſleues / a wayne rope / & a pytchforke. This wayne is made of dyuers peces that wyll haue great reparacion / that is to ſay / the wheles / and thoſe be made of nathes / ſpokes / felyes / and doubles / and they muſte be well 
                  •
               ettered with wode or yren / & yf they be yren bounde they are moche the better / and thoughe they be the derer at fyrſte / yet at lengthe they be better chepe / for a payre of wheles yren boūd wyll were. vii. or. viii. payre of other wheles / and they goo

rounde and lyght after oxen or horſes to draw. How be it on mareys groūde & ſofte ground the other wheles be better / bycauſe they be broder on y• ſoule / & wyll not go ſo depe, They muſt haue an axyltre clout with viii. wayncloutes of yren .ii. lynpynes of yren in the axyltre endes .ii. axyll pynnes of yren / or els of tough hard wode. The body of the wayne of oke / the ſtaues / the nether rathes / the ouer rathes / the croſſe ſomer / y• keys & pykſtaues. And yf he go with a horſe plow / thā muſt he haue his horſes / or mares / or both his hōbers or collers / holmes whyted / treſſes / ſwyngleters and togewith. Alſo a cart made of aſſhe / becauſe it is light and lyke ſtuffe to it as is to a wayne / and alſo a cart ſadell / bacbandes & bely bandes / and a cart ladder be hynde / whan he ſhall cary eyther corne or kyddes / or ſuch other. And in many contreys theyr waynes haue carte ladders both behynde & before. Alſo an huſband muſt haue an axe / a hachet / a hedgyngbyll / a pyn augur / a reſt augur / a flayle / a ſpade / and a ſhouell.
            And howe be it that I gyue theym theſe names as is moſt comonly vſed in my contrey / I know they haue other names in other contreys / but herby a man may parceyue many thynges belongynge to huſbandry to theyr greate coſtes & charges / for the mayntenaunce & vpholdynge of the ſame. And many mo thynges are belongynge to huſbandes than theſe as ye ſhall well perceyue or I make an ende of this treatyſe. And yf a yonge huſbande ſholde bye all theſe thynges / it wold be to coſtly to hym / wherfore it is neceſſary for hym / to lerne to make his yokes / oxe bowes / ſtoles / and all maner of ploughe gere.
         
         
            
            ¶ whether is better a plough of horſes or a ploughe of Oxen.
            IT is to be knowen whether is better a plough of horſes or a ploughe of oxen / and therin me ſemeth ought to be made a diſtincyon. For in ſome places an oxe plough is better than a horſe ploughe / and in ſome places a horſe plough is better / that is to ſay in euery place where as the huſbande hathe ſeuerall paſtures to put his oxen in whan they come fro theyr warke / there is the oxe ploughe the better. For an ore may not endure his warke to laboure all day / & than to be put to the comyns or before the herdman / & than to be ſet in a folde al nyght without meate / and go to his labour in the mornyng. But & he be put in a good paſture all nyght / he wyll labour moche of all y• daye dayly. And oxen wyll plowe in tough clay and vpon hylly grounde / where horſes wyll ſtande ſtyll: And where as is no ſeuerall paſtures / there y• horſe plowe is better / for the horſes may be teddered or tyed vpon 
                  ••
               ys / balkes or hades / where as oxen may not be kept and it is not vſyd to tedder them / but in fewe places. And horſes wyll go faſter than oxen on euen ground or lyght grounde / and quycker in caryages / but they be ferre more coſtly to kepe in wynter / for they muſt haue be the heye and corne to eat / and ſtrawe for lytter / they muſt be well ſhodde on all four fete / and the gere that they ſhall drawe with is more coſtely than for the oxen / and ſhorter whyle it wyll laſt. And the oxen wyll cate but ſtrawe and a lytell hey / the which is not halfe the coſte that horſes muſt haue / and they

haue no ſhoes as horſes haue. And yf ony ſorāce come to the horſes / waxe olde / bryſed or blynde / than he is lytell worth. And yf ony ſorāce come to an oxe / waxe olde / bryſed or blynde / for two ſhyllynges he may be fedde / & than he is mannes meet / and as good or better than euer he was. And the horſe whan he dyeth is but carien. And therfore me ſemeth all thynges cōſydred the plough of oxen is moche more profytable than the plough of horſes.
         
         
            ¶ The dylygence & the attendaunce that a huſbande ſholde gyue to his warke / in maner of an other prologue / and the ſpecyall grounde of all this treatyſe.
            THou huſbande y• entēdeſt to gete thy lyuynge by huſbandry / take hede to the ſayenge of the wyſe Phyloſopher / the wiche ſaith. Adhibe curam / tene menſurā / et eris diues. That is to ſay / take hede to thy charge / kepe meaſure / and thou ſhalt be ryche And now to ſpeke of the fyrſte artycle of theſe .iij. ſ. Adhibe curam. He that wyll take vpon hym to do ony thynge and be ſlouthfull / recheles / and not diligēt to execute nor performe that thynge that he taketh vpon hym / he ſhall neuer thryue by his occupacyon. And to the ſame entent ſayth our lorde in his goſpell by a parable. Nemo mittens manum ſuam ad aratrum reſpiciens retro / aptus eſt regnum dei. The ſpyrytuall cō
               ſtruccyon of this texte. I remyt it to the doctours of diuynite / and to the greate clerkes / but to reduce and brynge the ſame texte to my purpoſe. I take it thus. There is no man puttyng his hande to the plough lo▪
               
kynge bakward / is worthy to haue that thynge that he ought to haue. For yf he go to the ploughe and loke bakward / he ſeeth not whether the plough go in ryge or rayne / make a balke or go ouerthwart. And yf it ſo do / there wyll be lytel corne. And ſo yf a man attende not his huſbandry / but go to ſporte or play / tauerne or alehouſe / or ſlepynge at home / and ſuche other ydle warkes / he is not than worthy to haue any corne / & therfore. Fac ꝙ veniſti. Do that thou comeſt for / and thou ſhalt fynde that thou ſekeſt for.
         
         
            ¶ How a man ſholde plowe all maner of landes all tymes of the yere.
            NOw theſe plowes be made and tempered / it is to be knowen how a man ſholde plowe all tymes of the yere. In the begynnynge of the yere after the feſte of the Epyphany it is tyme for a huſbande to go to the plowe. And yf thou haue any leys to falowe or to ſowe otes vpon / fyrſt plow them that the graſſe and the moſſe may rote / and plow them a depe ſquare forowe. And in all maner of plowynges ſe that thy eye / thy hande / & thy fote may agre / & be alway redy one to ſerue an other / & to turne vp moche molde and to lay it flat that it rere nat on edge. For yf it rere on edge the graſſe and moſſe wyll not rote. And yf thou ſow it with wynter corne / as whete or rye / as moche corne as toucheth ye moſſe wyll be drowned / the moſſe dothe kepe ſuche wete in it ſelfe. And in ſom contreys yf a man plowe depe / he ſhall paſſe the good grounde and haue but lytell corne / but that contrey is nat for

men to kepe huſbandrye vpon / but for to rere & brede catell or ſhepe / for els they muſt go beat theyr landes with mattockes / as they do in many places of Corne wayle / and in ſome places of Deuenſhyre.
         
         
            ¶ To plowe for peſe and beanes.
            HOw to plowe for peſe & beanes were neceſſary to knowe: Fyrſt thou muſte remembre whychs is moſte cleye grounde / and that plowe fyrſt / and let it lye a good ſpace or thou ſowe it / bycauſe the froſt / y• rayne / the wynde / & the ſonne maye cauſe it to breke ſmall / to make moche molde / and to rygge it. And to plowe a ſquare forowe / the brede / and the depnes all one / and to laye it cloſe to his felowe. For the more forowes the more corne / for a generall rule of all maner of cornes. And that may be proued at the comyng vp of all maner of corne to ſtande at the landes ende and loke towarde the other ende. And than may ye ſe how the corne groweth.
         
         
            ¶ How to ſowe bothe peſe and beanes.
            THou ſhalt ſowe thy peſe vpon the cley groūde and thy beanes vpon the barley grounde / for they wolde haue ranker grounde than peſe. Howe be it ſome huſbandes holde opynyon / that bygge and ſtyffe grounde / as cleye / wolde be ſowen with bygge ware / as beanes / but me thynke the contrary / for & a drye ſomer come / his beanes wyll be ſhorte. And yf

the grounde be good / put the more beanes to the pees and y• better ſhall they yelde / whan they be threſſhed. And yf it be very ranke grounde as is moche at euery towne ſyde / where catell doth reſorte / plowe not that lande tyll ye wyll ſowe it / for & ye do there wyll come vp kedlokes and other wedes. And than ſowe it with beanes / for and ye ſowe pees the kedlokes wyll hurte them / & whan ye ſe ſeaſonable tyme ſowe bothe pees and benes / ſo that they be ſowen in the begynnynge of Marche. How ſhall ye know ſeaſonable tyme / go vpon the lande that is plowed / and yf it ſynge or crye or make ony noyſe vnder thy fete / than it is to wete to ſowe / and yf it make no noyſe and wyll beare thy horſes / than ſowe in the name of god / but how to ſowe▪ Put thy pees in to thy hopper and caſt a brode thonge o

And ſtande in the myddes of the lande where the ſacke lyeth / the whiche is mooſt conuenyēt for fyllynge of thy hopper / and ſet thy lyfte fote before and take an handfull of pees. And whan thou takeſt vp thy ryght fote / than caſt thy pees fro the all abrode / and whan thy lyfte fote ryſeth take an other handfull / and whan thy ryght fote ryſeth than caſt them fro the.

            ¶ Sede of dyſcreſſyon.
            THere is a ſede that is called dyſcreſſyon / & yf a huſbande haue of that ſede and myngle it amonge his other cornes / they wyll growe moche the better / for that ſede wyll tell hym howe many caſtes of corne euery lande ought to haue. And a yonge huſbande / and may fortune ſom olde huſbande haue nat ſuffycyent of that ſede / and he that lacketh let hym borowe of his neygheboures that haue. And his neyghboures be vnkynde yf they wyll nat lende this yonge huſbande part of this ſede. For this ſede of dyſcrecyon hath a wonders property / for the more that it is takē of or lent of / the more it is. And therfore me ſemeth it ſholde be more ſpyrytuall than temporall / wherin is a great dyuerſyte / for a temporall thynge the more it is deuyded the leſſe it is / and a ſpyrytuall thynge the more it is deuyded the more it is.

            ¶ How all maner corne ſholde be ſowen.
            BUt yet me thynketh it is neceſſarye to declare how all maner of corne ſhold be ſowen / & how moche vpon an acre mooſt comonly / and fyrſt of peſe and benes. An acre of grounde by the ſtatute / that is to ſaye. xvi. fote and a halfe to the perche or pole / four perches to an acre in brede / and. xl. perches to an acre in length / may be metely well ſowen with two London buſſſhels of pees / the which is but two ſtrykes in other places. And yf there be the fourthe parte beanes than wyl it haue half a London buſſhell more / & yf it 
                  •
               ehalfe benes it wyll haue thre London buſſhels / & yf it be all benes / it wyll haue foure London buſſhels fully / and that is halfe a quarter. Bycauſe the benes be greate and growe vp ſtreyght / and do not ſprede and go abrode as peſe do. An acre of good beanes is worth an acre and a halfe of good pees / bycauſe there wyll be more buſſhels. And the beſt property that belongeth to a good huſbande / is to ſowe all maner of corne thycke ynoughe / and ſpecyally benes and barley for comynly they be ſowen vpon ranke grounde / 

and good grounde wyll haue the burthen of corne or of wede. And as moche plowynge and harowynge hath an acre of grounde and ſowe therevpon but one buſſhell / as and he ſowed foure buſſhels. And vndouted one buſſhell may not gyue ſo moche corne agayne as the foure buſſhels / though the thre buſſhelles that he ſowed more be alowed and ſet apart. And one buſſhell and an halfe of whyte pees or grene peaſe / wyll ſow as moche grounde as two buſſhels of gray peſe / & that is bycauſe they be ſo ſmall the huſband nedeth not to take ſo great an handefull. In ſome contreys they begynne to ſowe peſe ſone after Chriſtmas / & in ſome places they ſowe bothe peſe & beanes vnder forow / and thoſe of reaſon muſt be ſowen betyme. But for the moſte generalyte to begyn ſone after Candelmaſſe is good ſeaſon / ſo that they be ſowen or the begynnynge of Marche or ſone vpon. And ſpecyally let them be ſowen in the old of the mone. For thopynyon of olde huſbandes is / that they ſhold the better codde and the ſoner be rype. But I ſpeke not of haſty peſe
                  •
                for they be ſowen before Chryſtmas.
         
         
            ¶ To ſowe barley.
            EUery good huſbande hathe his barley falowe well donged and lyenge rygged all the depe & 
                  •
               olde of wynter / y• whyche ryggynge maketh y• lande to be drye / and the dongynge maketh it to be melowe and ranke, And yf a drye ſeaſon com before Candelmaſſe or ſone after / it wold be caſt downe and water forowed betwene the lādes / that the wete reſt not in

the rayne / and in the begynnynge of Marche rygge it vp agayne / and to ſowe in euery acre ſyue London buſſhelles / or foure at the leeſt / & ſome yeres it may ſo fortune that there cometh no ſeaſonable wether before Marche to plowe his barleye erthe. And as ſone as he hathe ſowen his pees and beanes / than let hym caſt his barly erthe / & ſhortly after to rygge it agayne ſo that it be ſowen before Apryll. And yf the yere tyme be paſt / than ſowe it vpon the caſtynge. ¶ It is to be noted that there be thre maner of barleys / that is to ſay / ſprot barley / longe eare / & bere barley / that ſome men call bygge. Sprot barley hathe a flat eare moſte comōly / thre quarters of an inche brode / & thre ynches longe / and the cornes be very great and whyte / and it is the beſt barley / Longe eare hath a flat eare halfe an ynche brode / & foure ynches & more of lenght. But the corne is not ſo great nor ſo whyte / & ſoner it wyll turne & grow to the otes. Bere barley or bygge wolde be ſowen vpon lyght & drye grounde / & hathe an eare thre ynches of lengthe or more / ſet foure ſquare lyke pecke whete / ſmall cornes & lytell floure / and that is the worſt barley / and foure London buſſhels are ſuffycyent for an acre. And in ſome contreys they do nat ſowe theyr barley tyll Maye / & that is moſt comynly vpon grauell or ſandy groūde. But that barley generally is neuer ſo good as that y• is ſowen in Marche. For yf it be very drye wether after it be ſowen / that corne that lyeth aboue lyeth drye & hath no moyſture and that that lyeth vnderneth cometh vp / and whan rayne cometh than ſprytteth that that lyeth aboue / & often tymes it is grene whan the other is rype / and

whan it is threſſhed there is moche lyght corne.
         
         
            ¶ To ſowe otes.
            ANd in Marche it is tyme to ſowe otes & ſpecyally vpon lyght grounde & drye / howe be it they wyll grow on weter groūde than any corne els for wete grounde is good for no maner of corne / and thre London buſſhels wyll ſow an acre. And it is to be knowē that there be thre maner of otes / that is to ſaye / rede otes / blacke otes / & roughe otes. Rede otes are the beſt otes / and whan they be threſſhed they be yelow in y• buſſhell / & very good to make otemele of. Black otes are as great as they be / but they haue nat ſo moche floure in them / for they haue a thycker huſke and alſo they be nat ſo good to make otemele of.
            The rough otes be the worſt otes / and it quyteth nat the coſt to ſowe them / they be very lyght & haue longe tayles / wherby they wyll hange eche one to other. All theſe maner otes weare the grounde very ſore / and maketh it to be quyche. ¶ A yonge huſbande ought to take hede howe thycke he ſoweth all maner of corne two or thre yeres / & to ſe how it cometh vp, & whether it be thycke ynoughe or nat / and yf it be thyn / ſowe thycker the nexte yere / & yf it be well / holde his hande there other yeres / and yf it be to thyn / let hym remember hym ſelfe whether it be for the vnſeſonablenes of the wether / or fere of thyn ſowynge. And ſo his wyſdome and dyſcreſſyon muſt dyſcerne it.
         
         
            ¶ To harow all maner of cornes.
            
               NOw theſe landes be plowed & the cornes ſowē it is conuenient that they be well harowed / or els crowes / douues / and other byrdes wyll eate and beare away the cornes. It is vſed in many contreys huſbandes to haue an oxe harowe / the which is made of ſyxe ſmall pyeces of tymbre called harowe bulles made eyther of aſſhe or oke / they be two yardes longe and as moche as the ſmall of a mannes legge / & haue ſhotes of woode put thrughe them lyke lathes / and in euery bull are ſyxe ſharpe peces of yren / called harow tyndes / ſet ſom what a ſlope forwarde / & the formoſte ſlote muſte be bygger than the other / bycauſe the fote teame ſhalbe faſtened to the ſame with a ſhakell or a with to drawe by. This harowe is good to breake the greate clottes / and to make moche molde / and than the horſe harowes to come after to make the clottes ſmaller / and to lay the grounde euen. ¶ It is a great labour and payne to the oxen to go to harow / for they were better to go to the plowe two dayes than to harowe one daye. It is an olde ſaynge / the oxe is neuer wo / tyll he to the harow go. And it is bycauſe it gothe by wytches / and nat alway after one draught. The horſe harow is made of fyne bulles / and paſſe not an elle of length / and not ſo moche as the other / but they be lyke ſloted & tynded. And whan the corne is well couered / than it is harowed ynoughe. There be horſe harowes that haue tyndes of wode / and thoſe be vſed moche aboute Ryppon & ſuche other places where be many bulder ſtones / for theſe ſtones wolde weare the yren to ſone / & thoſe tyndes be mooſte comonly made of the groūde ende of a yonge aſſhe / and they be more

than a fote longe in y• begynnyng / & ſtande as moche aboue the harowe as benethe. And as they weare or breke they dryue them downe lower / & they wolde be made longe before or they be occupyed that they may be drye / for than they ſhall endure & laſt moche better & ſtycke the faſter. The horſes that ſhall drawe theſe harowes muſt be well kepte & ſhodde or els they wyll ſone be tyred / and ſore bete / that they may not draw. They muſt haue hombers or collers / holmes withed about theyr neckes / treſſes to draw by / and a ſwyngletre to holde the treſſes abrode / and a togewith to be betwene y• ſwyngleter & the harow. And yf the barley grounde wyll nat breke with harowes but be clotty it wolde be beaten with malles / & not ſtreyght down for than they bete the corne into the erthe. And yf they bete the clot on the ſyde it wyll the better breke. And y• clot wyll lye lyghte y• the corne may lyghtly come vp. And they vſe to role theyr barley groūd after a ſhoure of rayne / to make the grounde euen to mowe.
         
         
            ¶ To falowe▪
            
            NOw theſe huſbandes haue ſowen theyr peaſe beanes / barley & otes / and harowed thē / it is the beſt tyme to falow in the latter ende of Marche & Apryll / for whete / rye / & barley. And let the huſband do the beſt he can to plowe a brode forow and a depe / ſo that he turne it clene and lay it flat / that it rere nat on the edge / the whiche ſhall deſtroye all the thyſtyls and wedes. For the deper & the broder that he gothe / the more newe molde / and the greater clottes ſhall

he haue / and the greater clottes the better whete / for the clottes kepe the whete warme all wynter / and at Marche they wyll melte and breke and fall in many ſmall pyeces / the which is a newe dongynge and refreſſhynge of the corne. And alſo there ſhall but lytell wedes growe vpon the falowes that are ſo falowed / for the ploughe goth vndernethe the rotes of all maner of wedes / & turneth the rote vpwarde that it may not growe / & yf the lande be falowed in wynter tyme it is farre the worſe for thre pryncypall cauſes / One is / all the rayne that cometh ſhall waſſhe the lande & dryue awaye the dounge and the good moldē that the land ſhalbe moche the worſe. An other cauſe the rayn ſhall bete the lande ſo flatte / bake it ſo harde to gyder that yf a drye Maye come / it wyll be to harde to ſtere in the moneth of June. And the thyrde cauſe is / The wedes ſhal take ſuch rote or ſterynge tyme com / that they wyll not be clene turned vndernethe / the which ſhalbe great hurte to the corne whan it ſhalbe ſowen and ſpecyally in the tyme of wedynge of the ſame / & for any other thynge make a depe holow forow in the rydge of the lande / & loke well thou reſt balke it nat / for and thou do / there wyll be many thyſtyls / & than thou ſhalt not make a clene rydge at the fyrſt ſteryng and therfore it muſt nedes be dep

            ¶ To cary out donge or mucke & to ſprede it.
            ANd in the later ende of Apryll and the begyn nynge of Maye is tyme to cary oute his donge

or muke / and to lay it vpon his barley grounde. And where he hath barley thys yere / ſowe it with whete or rye the nexte tyme it is falowed / & ſo ſhall he mucke all his landes ouer at euery ſeconde falowe. But that huſbande that can fynde the meanes to cary out his donge / & to lay it vpon his lande after it be ones ſturred / it is moche better than to laye it vpon his falowe for dyuers cauſes. One is / yf it be layde vpon his falowe all that falleth in the holowe rygge ſhal do lytel good / for whan it is rygged agayne / it lyeth ſo depe in the erth it wyll not be plowed vp agayne / excepte that whan he hath ſpred it / that he wyll with a ſhouell or a ſpade caſt out all that is fallen in the rygge. And yf it be layde vpon the ſturynge / at euery plowynge it ſhall meddle the donge and the erthe togyder / the whiche ſhall cauſe the corne moche better to grow and encreace. And in ſome places they lode not theyr donge tyll harueſt be done / & that is vſed in the farther ſyde of Darbyſſhyre / called Scareſdale / Halomſhyre / and ſo northwarde towarde 
                  •
               orke & Ryppon / and that I call better than vpō the falowe / and ſpecyally for barley / but vpon the fyrſte ſturrynge is beſt for whete and rye / and that his donge be layde vpon ſmall hepes nyghtogyder / & to ſprede it euenly and to leue no dong there as the mucke hepe ſtode / for the moyſtnes of the donge ſhall cauſe the groūde to be ranke ynough. And yf it be medled witherth / as ſh

               lynges and ſuch other / it wyll laſt the lenger / & better for barley than for whete or rye / bycauſe of wedes. Horſe donge is the worſt donge that is. The dong of all maner cattell that chewe theyr cudde is very good

And the donge of douues is beſt / but it muſt be layde on the grounde very thynne.
         
         
            ¶ To ſet out the ſhepe folde.
            ALſo it is tyme to ſet out the ſhepefolde in May & to ſette it vpon the rye grounde / yf thou haue any / and to flyt it euery mornynge or nyghte / and in the mornyng whan he cometh to his folde / let not his ſhepe out anone / but reyſe them vp & let them ſtande ſtyll a good ſeaſon / that they may donge & pyſſe. And go amonge them to ſe whether any of them haue any mathes / or be ſcabbed / & ſe them thre or foure tymes on the one ſyde / & as ofte on the other ſyde. And whan the kelles be gone beſyde the grounde / than let them out of the folde / & dryue them to the ſoundeſt place of the felde, But he that hathe a falowe feelde ſeuerall to hym ſelf / let hym occupy no folde / for foldyng of ſhepe maketh them ſcabbed / & bredethmathes / and whan a ſtorme of yll wether cometh in the nyght they can not flye nor go away / & that appeyreth them ſore of theyr fleſſhe. But let that man that hath ſuch a ſeuerall falowe felde / let hym dryue .rx. or .xxx. or .xl. ſtakes accordyng to the nōbre of his ſhepe vpon his falow where he wolde ſet his felde / & ſpecyally in the fartheſt part of the felde from thens as they com in / for the goynge vpon doth moche good. And let the ſhepard bryng his ſhepe to the ſtakes / & the ſhepe wyll rubbe thē on the ſtakes. And let the ſheparde go aboute them tyll they be ſet / & thus ſerue them two or thre nyghtes / & they wyll folowe thoſe ſtakes as he flytteth them & ſyt by

them. And yf any yll wether come / they wyll ryſe vp and go to the hedge. And this maner of foldyng ſhall brede no mathes nor ſcabbes / nor apeyre thē of theyr fleſſhe / and ſhal be a great ſaue garde to the ſhepe for rottynge / and in the mornynge put them out of theyr paſture / & thou ſhalt nat nede to bye any hurdels nor ſhepeflekes / but how ye ſhal ſalue them or dreſſe them ye ſhall vnderſtande it in the chapyter of ſhepe after.
         
         
            ¶ To cary wode and other neceſſaryes.
            ANd in May whā thou haſt falowed thy groūd and ſet oute thy ſhepefolde and caryed oute thy dong or muke / yf thou haue any wode / cole or tymbre to cary / or ſuch other beſynes that muſt nedes be don with thy carte or wayne / than is it tyme to do it. For than the waye is lyke to be fayre and drye / and the dayes longe / and that tyme the huſbande hathe leeſte to do in huſbandry. Perauenture I ſet one thynge to be done at one tyme of the yere / and yf the huſbande ſholde do it / it ſholde be a greater loſſe to hym in an other thynge / wherfore it is mooſte conuenyent to do that thynge fyrſte that is moſte profytable to hym / & as ſone as he can / to do the other labour.
         
         
            ¶ To knowe dyuers maner of wedes.
            IN the later ende of Maye & the begynnynge of June / is tyme to wede thy corne. There be dyuers maner of wedes / as thyſtyls / kedlokes / dockes / cocledrake / darnolde / gouldes / haudodes / dog
                  •
               enell / 

mathes / terre / & dyuers other ſmall wedes. But theſe be they that greue mooſt. The thyſtyll is an yll wede rough & ſharpe to handell / & freteth awaye the cornes nygh it / & cauſeth the ſterers not to ſhere clene. Kedlo kes hath a lefe lyke rapes / & beareth a yelowe floure / & is an yll wede / & groweth in almaner corne / & hath ſmall coddes / & groweth lyke muſtarde ſede. Dockes haue a brode lefe / & dyuers hygh ſpyres / & very ſmall ſede in the toppe. Cockole hath a longe ſmall lefe / and wyll beare. v. or. vi. floures purple colour as brode as a grote / & the ſede is rounde & blacke / and may well be ſuffred in brèèd corne / but not in ſede / for therin is moche floure. Drake is lyke vnto rye tyll it begyn to 
                  •
               ede / & it hath many ſedes lyke fenell ſedes & hangeth downwarde / and it may well be ſuffred in breed / for there is moche floure in the ſede / and it is an opinyon that it cometh of rye. & ce. Dernolde groweth vp ſtreyght lyke an hye graſſe / and hath longe ſedes on eyther ſyde the ſterte / & there is moche floure in that ſede / and groweth moche amonge barley / and it is ſayde that it cometh of ſmall barley. Goldes hath a ſhorte iagged lefe / and groweth halfe a yarde hygh / and hath a yelowe floure as brode as a grote / and is an yll wede / and groweth comynly in barley & pees. Hawdod hath a blewe floure and a fewe lytell leues / and hath fyue or ſyxe braunches floured in the toppe / and groweth comynly in rye vpon leane grounde / & dothe lytell hurte. Dogſenell & mathes is bothe one / and in the comynge vp is lyke fenell / & beareth many whyte floures with a yelowe ſede / and it is the worſt wede that is / excepte terre / and it cometh mooſt comynly

whan greate wete cometh ſhortly after y• corne be ſowen. Terre is the worſt wede / and it neuer doth appere tyll the moneth of June / and ſpecyally whan there is great wete in that mone or a lytell before / & groweth mooſt in rye / & it groweth lyke fytches / but it is moche ſmaller / and it wyll growe as hye as the corne / & with the weyght therof it pulleth the corne flat to the erth and freteth the eares away. wherfore I haue ſene huſbādes mowe downe the corne and it togyder. And alſo with ſharpe hokes to repe it as they do pees and made it drye / & than it wyll be good fodder. There be other wedes not ſpoken of / as dee / nettyls / dodder / and ſuche other do moche harme.
         
         
            ¶ How to wede corne.
            NOw it wold be knowē how theſe cornes ſhold be weded. The chefe inſtrument to wede with is a payre of tonges made of wode / and in y• farther ende it is nycked to holde the wede faſter / and after a ſhoure of rayne it is beſt wedynge / for than they may be pulled vp by y• rotes / & than it cometh neuer agayn And yf it be drye wether / thā muſt ye haue a wedyng hoke wt a ſocket ſet vpō a lytell ſtaffe of a yarde lōge / & this hoke wolde be well ſteeled & groūde ſharpe bothe behynde & before. And in his other hand he hath a forked ſtycke a yarde longe / & wt his forked ſtycke he putteth the wede frō hym & he putteth y• hoke beyonde the rote of the wede & pulleth it to hym & cutteth y• wede faſt by y• erth / & with his hoke he taketh vp the wede and caſteth it in the reyne / & yf y• reyne be full of corne

it is better to ſtande ſtyll whan it is cut & wydre / but let hym beware y• he trede not to moche vpō the corne and ſpecyally after it be ſhotte / & whan he cutteth the wede y• he cut not the corne / & therfore the hoke wolde not paſſe an inche wyde. And whan y• wede is ſo ſhort that he can not with his forked pyke put it fro hym / & with y• hoke pull it to hym / than muſt he ſet his hoke vpon the wede faſt by the erthe & put it fro hym / & ſo ſhall he cut it clene. And with theſe two inſtrumētes he ſhal neuer ſtoupe at his wacke. Dogfenell / goldes mathes & kedlokes are yll to wede after this maner / they grow vpon ſo many braunches hard by the erth and therfore they vſe moſt to pull them vp with theyr handes / but loke well y• they pull nat vp y• corne with all / but as for terre there wyll no wedynge ſerue.
         
         
            ¶ The fyrſt ſturrynge.
            ALſo in June is tyme to rygge vp thy falowe / the which is called the fyrſt ſturrynge / and to 
                  •
               lowe it as depe as he can for to turne the rotes of the wedes vpwarde / that the ſonne & y• drye wether may kyll them. And an huſband can not cōuenyētly plow his lande and lode oute his donge bothe vpon a daye with one draught of beſtes / but a huſbande may well lode out his donge before none / & to lode hey or corne at after none / or he may plow before none / and lode hey or corne after none with the ſame draught / & no hurt to the cattell / bycauſe in lodynge of hey or corne the cattell is alway eatynge or beytynge / and ſo they can not do in lodynge of donge and plowynge.
         
         
            
            ¶ To mowe graſſe.
            ALſo in y• later ende of June is tyme to begyn to mow / yf thy medowe be well growen / but how ſo euer they be growen in July they muſt nedes mow for dyuers cauſes. One is / it is not conuenyent to haue hey & corne bothe in occupacyon at one tyme An other is the yonger and the grener that the graſſe is / the ſofter and the ſweter it wyll be whan it is hey / but it wyll haue the more wyddrynge / and the elder the graſſe is / the harder and dryer it is / and the worſe for all maner of catell / for the ſedes be fallen whiche is in maner of prouandre / and it is the harder to eate and chowe. And an other cauſe / yf drye wether come it wyll drye and burne vpon the grounde and waſt it awaye. Take hede thy mower mowe clene and holde downe the hynder hande of his ſythe / that he do not endente the graſſe / and to mow his ſwathe clene thorowe to that that was laſt mowē before / that he leue nat a mane betwene / and ſpecyally in the comon medowe / but in the ſeuerall medowe it maketh the leſſe charge / and that the moldywarpe hylles be ſpredde / & the ſtyckes clene pyked out of thy medow in Apryll or in the begynnynge of Maye.
         
         
            ¶ How forkes and rakes ſholde be made.
            A Good huſbande hath his forkes & rakes made redy in the wynter before / and they wolde be gote bytwene Myghelmaſſe and Martylmaſſe / and beyked / and ſet euen to lye vpryght in thy hand / and

than they wyll be harde / ſtyffe & drye. And whan the huſbande ſytteth by the fyre and hath nothynge to do than may he make them redy / & tothe the rakes with drye wethy wode / & bore the holes wyth his wymble bothe aboue & vnder / & dryue the tethe vpwarde faſt & harde / & than wedge them aboue wt drye wode of oke for that is harde / & wyll dryue & neuer come out. And yf he gete them in ſappe tyme al ye beykyng & dryenge that can be had ſhall not make them hard & ſtyffe / but they wyll alway be plyeng / for they be moſt comynly made of haſel & withe / & theſe be the trees that blome and ſpecyally haſell / for it begineth to blome as ſoone as the lefe is fallen / and yf the rake be made of grene wode / the heed wyll not abyde vpon ye ſtele / & the teth wyll fall out whan he hath mooſt nede to them / & let his warke & loſe moche hey. And ſe that thy rake and forke lye vpryght in thy hand / for and the one ende of thy rake or the ſyde of thy forke hange downe warde than they be not handſome nor eaſy to worke with.
         
         
            ¶ To tedde and make hey.
            wHan thy medowes be mowed they wolde be well tedded & layde euen vpon the grounde / & yf the graſſe be very thycke it wolde be ſhaken with handes / or with a ſhorte pykforke / for good teddyng is ye chefe poynt to make good hey / for than ſhall it be wyddred all in lyke / or els not / & whan it is well wyddred on the ouerſyde and drye / thā turne it clene before noone as ſoone as the dew is gone. And if thou dare truſt the wether / than let it lye ſo all nyght / and

on the next day turne it agayn before none / & toward nyght make it in wyndrowes & than in ſmal heycockes / & ſo to ſtande one nyght at the leſte & ſwete / & on the next fayr day caſt it abrode agayn / & turne it ones or twyſe / and than make it in greater heycockes / & to ſtand ſo one nyght or more / that it may vngyue and ſwete / for & it ſwet not in ye heycokes it wyll ſwete in ye mowe / & thā it wyll be duſty & not holſom for hors / beſtes / nor ſhepe. And whan it ſtandeth in the cockes it is better to lode / and the more hey may be loded at a lode / and the faſter it wyll lye. Quyche hey cometh of a graſſe called crofote / & groweth flat after the erth / & beareth a yelowe floure halfe a yarde hygh & more / & hath many knottes towarde the rote / & it is ye beſt hey for horſes & beſtes / and the ſweteſt yf it be well gote / but it wyll haue moche more wyddrynge than other hey / for els he wyll bepyſſe hym ſelfe and waxe hote / and after duſty. And for to know whan it is wydred ynough / make a lytell rope of the ſame that ye thynke ſholde be moſt greneſt / & twyne it as hard togyder by twene your handes as ye can / & ſo beynge hard twon let one take a knyfe & cut it faſt by your hande / & the knottes wyll be moyſt yf it be nat dry ynough / ſhorte hey & ley hey is good for ſhepe & all maner of cattell yf it be well get, A man may ſpeke of makynge of hey & gettynge of corne / but god dyſpoſeth and ordreth all thynges.
         
         
            ¶ How rye ſholde be ſhorne.
            ANd in the later ende of July or ye begynnyng of Auguſt is tyme to ſhere rye / ye which wolde

be ſhorne clene and faſt bounde. And in ſome places they mowe it / ye whiche is not ſo good to the huſbādes ꝓfyte / but it is y• ſoner done. For whan it is mowen it wyll nat be ſo faſt boūd / & he can not gader it ſo clene but there wyll be moche loſte / and taketh more rome in y• barne than ſhorne corne dothe. And alſo it wyll not kepe nor ſaue it ſelfe fro rayne or yll weder whā it ſtandeth in the couer / as ſhorne corne wyll do.
         
         
            ¶ How to ſhere whete.
            wHete wolde be ſhorne clene & harde bounde in lyke maner / but for a general rule / take good hede that the ſherers of all maner of whyte corne caſt not vp theyr handes haſtely / for thā all the loſe corne & the ſtrawes that he holdeth not faſt ī his hande flyeth ouer his hede & are loſt / and alſo it wyll pull of the eares / & ſpecyally of the cornes that be very rype. In ſome places they wyll ſhere theyr cornes hyghe to the entente to mowe theyr ſtubble / eyther to thacke or to bren / yf they ſo do they haue greate cauſe to take good hede of the ſherers / for yf the eares of the corne croke downe to the erthe / yf the ſherer take nat good hede / & put vp the eare or he cut the ſtrawe / as many eres as be vnder his hoke or ſycle fall to y• erth and be loſt / & whan they mowe the ſtubble it is great hyndraūce to the profyte of the groūde. And in Sommerſet ſhyre about zelceſter & Martocke / they do ſhere theyr whete very lowe / and all the whete ſtraw that they purpoſe to make thacke of / they do not threſhe it but cut of the eares and bynde it in ſheues / and call it

rede / and therwith thacke theyr houſes. And yf it be a new houſe / they thack it vnder theyr fote / the which is the beſt & the ſureſt thackynge that can be of ſtraw for crowes and douues ſhall neuer hurte it.
         
         
            ¶ To mowe or ſhere barley and otes.
            BArley and otesbe mooſt comonly mowen / and a man or woman folowyng the mower with a hande rake halfe a yard longe / with. vii. or. viii. tethe in his lyfte hande / and a ſyckle in his ryghte hande / & with the rake he gadereth as moche as wyll make a ſhefe / & than he taketh the barleye or otes by ye toppes and pulleth out as moche as wyll make a bande / and caſteth the bande from hym on the lande / & with his rake and his ſyckle taketh vp the barley or otes / and layth thē vpon the bande / & ſo ye barley lyeth vnboūd thre or foure dayes yf it be fayre weder / and than to bynd it. And whan the barley is led away the landes muſt be raked / or els there wyll be moch corne loſt / & yf the barley or otes lye / they muſt nedes be ſhorne.
         
         
            ¶ To repe or mowe pees and branes.
            PEſe and beanes be moſt comynly laſt reped or mowen of dyuers maners / ſom with ſyckles / ſome with hokes / and ſome with ſtaffe hokes. And in ſome places they laye them on repes / & whan they be drye they laye them to gydre on hepes lyke hey cockes and neuer bynde theym. But the beſte waye is whan the repes be drye to bynde them / & to ſet them on the

rydge of the lāde thre ſhreues to gydre / and loke that your ſheres / repers / nor mowers gelde not your beanes / that is to ſaye / to cut thy beanes ſo hye that the nethermoſt codde grow ſtyll on the ſtalke / and whan they be bounde they are the more redyer to lode and vnlode / to make a reke / and to take fro the mowe to threſſhe. And ſo be nat the repes.
         
         
            ¶ How all maner of cornes ſholde be tythed.

The ſhepe that thou wylt fede by them ſelfe / the ewes by theym ſelfe / the ſhare hogges / and theyues by them ſelfe / the lambes by them ſelfe / wedders and the rāmes by them ſelfe / yf thou haue ſo many paſtures for them / for the byggeſt wyll beate the weykeſt with his hede. And of euery ſorte of ſhepe / it may fortune there be ſom that lyke nat and be weke / thoſe wolde be put in freſſhe graſſe by them ſelfe / and whan they be a lyttell mended? than ſell them / & ofte chaunge of graſſe ſhall mende all maner of cattell.
         
         
            ¶ what thynge rotteth ſhepe.
            IT is neceſſary that a ſhepeharde ſholde knowe what thynge rotteth ſhepe / that he myght kepe them the better. There is gras called ſperewort / and

hathe a longe narowe lefe lyke a ſpere hede / & it wyll grow a fote hyghe / & beareth a yelow floure as brode as a peny / & it groweth alway in lowe places where the water is vſed to ſtand in wynter. An other graſſe is called peny graſſe / & groweth lowe by the erth in a marſſhe grounde / & hathe a lefe as brode as a peny of two pens / & neuer beareth floure. All maner of graſſe that the lande flode ronneth ouer is very yll for ſhepe bycauſe of the ſande & fylthe that ſtycketh vpon it. All marreys groūde & maraſſhe grounde is yll for ſhepe / the gras that groweth vpon falowes is not good for ſhepe / for there is moche of it wede / and oftentymes it cometh vp by the rote / & that bryngeth erthe with it / and they eate bothe. &c. Myldewe graſſe is nat good for ſhepe / and that ſhall ye know to ways. One is by the leues on the trees in a mornyng / and ſpecyally of okes / take the leues and put thy tonge to them / and thou ſhalte fele lyke hony vppon them / and alſo there wyll be many kelles vppon the graſſe / & that cauſeth the myldew. wherfore they may not well be let out of the folde tyll the ſonne haue domynacyō to drye them awaye. Alſo hunger rotte is the worſt rotte that can be / for there is nether good fleſſhe nor good ſkynne / & that cometh for lacke of meat / and ſo for hunger they eat ſuche as they can fynde / and ſo wyll nat paſture ſhepe / for they ſelden rote but with myldewes / and than they wyll haue moche talowe and fleſſhe / and a good ſkynne. Alſo whyte ſneles be yll for ſhepe in paſtures & in falowes. There is an other rotte is called pelte rotte / and that cometh of greate wete / ſpecyally in wode contreys where they can nat drye.
         
         
            
            ¶ To knowe a rotten ſhepe dyuers maner wayess wherof ſome of them wyll nat fayle.
            TAke bothe your handes & twyrle vpon his eye and yf he be ruddy & haue rede ſtryndes in the whyte of the eye / than he is ſounde / and yf the eye be whyte lyke talowe and the ſtryndes darke coloured / than he is rotten. And alſo take the ſhepe & open the woll on the ſyde / and yf the ſkynne be of ruddy colour and drye / than is he ſoūde / and yf it be pale coloured and watrye / than is he roten. Alſo whan ye haue opened the woll on the ſyde / take a lytell of the woll bytwene thy fynger and thy thombe and pull it a lytle / and yf it ſtycke faſt he is ſounde / and yf it come lyghtly of: he is rotten. Alſo whan thou haſt kylde a ſhepe his bely wyll be full of water yf he be ſore rotē / & alſo the fatte of the fleſſhe wyll be yelowe yf he be rotten. And alſo and thou cut the lyuer / therin wyll be lytell quikens lyke flokes / and alſo the lyuer wyll be full of knottes & whyte blyſters yf he be roten / & alſo ſethe the lyuer / yf he be rotten it wyll breke in peces / & yf he be ſounde / it wyll holde to gyder.
         
         
            ¶ To bye leane catell.
            THeſe huſbandes & they ſhal well thryue / they muſt haue both kye / oxen / horſes / mares / and yonge catell / and to rere and brede euery yere ſome calues & fooles / or els ſhall he be a byet. And yf thou ſhalte bye oxen for the ploughe / ſe that they be yonge and not gowty / nor broken of here / neyther of tayle / 

nor of pyſell. And yf thou by kyen to the payle / ſe that they be yonge & good to mylke / & fede her calues well. And yf y• bye kye or oxen to fede / the yonger they be? ye rather they wyll fede / but loke wel that the here ſtare not / & that he lycke hym ſelfe / and be hole mouthed / & want no tethe. And though he haue the goute and be broken bothe of tayle & pyſell / yet wyll he fede. But ye gouty oxe wyll not be dryuen ferre / & ſe that he haue a brode rybbe & a thycke hyde / & to be loſe ſkynned y• it ſtycke not harde nor ſtreyt to his rybbes / for than he wyll nat fede.
         
         
            ¶ To bye fatte cattell.
            ANd yf thou ſhalte bye fatte oxen or kye / hādell them / & ſe that they be ſofte on the fore croppe / behynd the ſholder / and vpon the hyndermoſt rybbe / and vpon the hucklebone / and the nache by the tayle And ſe the oxe haue a greate codde / & the cowe greate nauyll / for than it ſholde ſeme that they ſhold be well talowed. And take hede where thou byeſt ony leane cattell or fatte / & of whom / & where it was bred. For yf thou bye out of a better ground than thou haſt thy ſelfe / that catell wyl not lyke with the. And alſo loke that there be no maner of ſekenes amonge the cattell in that towneſhyp or paſture that thou byeſt thy cattell out of. For yf there be any murren or lōge ſought it is great Jeopardy / for a beſt may take ſekenes ten or twelue dayes or more or it appere on hyn.
         
         
            ¶ Dyuerſe ſekenes of catell / and remedyes therfore / and fyrſt of murren.
            
               ANd yf it fortune to fall murreyn amonge thy beeſtes / as god forbyd / there ben ynoughe can helpe them. And it cometh of a ranknes of blode / and apereth moſte comynly fyrſt in the hede / for his hede wyll ſwell / & his eyen waxe great / and ronne of water and frothe at the mouth / and than he is paſt reme dy / and wyll dye ſhortlye / and wyil neuer eate after he be ſycke. Than fley hym and make a depe pyt faſte by there as he dyeth and caſte hym in / and couer hym with erthe that no dogges may come to the caryen. For as many beſtes as feleth the ſmell of that caryen are lykely to be enfect / and take the ſkynne / and haue it to the tanners to ſell / and bryng it not home for peryll that may fall. And it is comonly vſed & cometh of a great charyte / to take the bare hed of the ſame beſte and put it vpon a longe pole and ſette in a hedge faſt bounde to a ſtake by y• hye way ſyde / that euery man that rydeth or goeth that way / may ſe and knowe by that ſygne that there is ſyknes of cattell in the townſhyppe. And the huſbandes holde on opynyon / that it ſhall the rather ceaſe. And whan the beeſte is flayne there as the murren dothe appere bytwene the fleſſhe and the ſkynne / it wyll ryſe vp lyke a ielly / and froth an ynche depe or more. And this is the remedy for the murren, Take a ſmall curteyn corde & bynde it harde about the beſtes necke / and that wyll cauſe the blode to com into the necke / and on eyther ſyde of the necke there is a vayn that a man may fele with his fynger / and than take a blode yren / & ſet it ſtreyght vpon the vayne / and ſmyte hym blode on bothe ſydes / and let hym blede the mountenaūce of a pynte or nyghe it / &

than take away the corde & it wyll ſtaūche bledynge. And thus ſerue all thy cattell that be in that cloſe or paſture / & there ſhall no mo be ſeke by goddes leue.
         
         
            ¶ Longe ſought / and remedy therfore.
            THere is an other maner of ſykenes amonge beeſtes is called longe ſought / & that ſyckenes wyll endure longe / and ye ſhall perceyue it by his hoyſtynge / he wyll ſtande moche and eat but a lytell and waxe very holowe and thyn. And he wyll hoyſte twenty tymes in an houre / and but fewe of them do mende. The beſt remedy is to kepe thy cattell in ſondrye places / and as many as were in companye with that beſt that fyrſt fell ſeke / to let them a lytell blode. And there be many men that can ſeuer theym / & that is to cutte the dewlappe before / and there is a graſſe that is called fetter graſſe / and take that graſſe and bryſe it a lytell in a morter / and put therof as moche as an hennes egge in to the ſayde dewlappe / and ſe it fall nat oute. Thus I haue ſene vſed / and men hathe thought it hathe done good.
         
         
            Dewbolue / and the harde remedy therfore.
            ANother dyſeaſe amonge beſtes is called dewbolue / and that cometh whan a hungry beeſte is put in a good paſture full of ranke graſſe / he wyll ete ſo moche that his ſydes wyll ſtande as hye as his backe bone / & otherwhyle the one ſyde more than the other / & but fewe of them wyll dye / but he may not be

dryuen haſtly nor laboured beynge ſo ſwollen / & the ſubſtaunce of it is but wynde / and therfore he wolde be ſoftely dryuen & nat ſyt downe. How be it I haue ſene a man take a knyfe and thruſt hym thrughe the ſkynne and the fleſſhe two ynches depe or more / ſyxe ynches or more from the rydge bone / that the wynde may come out. For the wynde lyeth betwene y• fleſſhe and the great paunche.
         
         
            ¶ Ryſen vpon / and the remedy therfore.
            ANother dyſeaſe is called ryſen vpon / & no mā can tell how nor wherof it cometh / but ye ſhal perceyue that by ſwellynge in the hede / & ſpecyally by the eyen / for they wyll ron on water & cloſe his ſyght & wyll dye ſhortly within an hour or two / if he be not holpē / this is y• cauſe of his dyſeaſe. There is a blyſter ryſen vnder the tonge / y• which blyſter muſt be ſlytte with a knyfe a croſſe. whā ye haue pulled out ye tonge rubbe the blyſter well with ſalte / and take an hēnes egge / & breke it in the beſtes mouthe ſhell & all / & caſt ſalte to it / & holde vp the beſtes hede / that all may be ſwalowed downe into the body. But the brekynge of the blyſter is the great helpe / & dryue the beeſt a lytle aboute / & this ſhall ſaue hym by the helpe of Jeſu.
         
         
            ¶ The turne / and remedy therfore.
            THere be beeſtes that wyll turne about whan they at theyr mete / and wyll not feede / and is great ieopardy for fallynge in pyttes / dyches / or waters / 

and it is bycauſe that there is a bladder in the forhede / bytwene the brayn panne and the braynes the whiche muſt be taken out / or elles he ſhall neuer mende / but dye aſ length / and this is the remedy and the greteſt cure that can be on a beeſt. Take that beſt and caſt hym downe and bynde his foure fete to gyder / & with thy thombe thruſt the beſte in the forhed / and where thou fyndeſt the ſofteſt place / there take a knyfe and cut the ſkyn thre or foure ynches on bothe ſydes betwene y• hornes / & as moche beneth towarde the noſe / and fley it and turne it vp / and pyn it faſt with a pynne / & with a knyfe cut the brayne panne two inches brode & thre inches longe / but ſe the knyfe go no deper than the thycknes of the bone for peryſſhynge of the brayne / and take away the bone / and than thou ſhalt ſe a bladder full of water two ynches longe and more / take that out & hurte nat the brayn and than let downe the ſkyn / & ſowe it faſte there as it was before / & bynde a cloth two or thre folde vpon his forehede to kepe it from colde and wete. ten or. xii. dayes. And thus haue I ſene many mended. But yf the beſte be falte and any reaſonable mete vpon hym it is beſt to kyll hym / for than there is but lytle loſſe / and yf the bladder be vnder the horne / it is paſt cure. A ſhepe wyll haue the turne as well as a beſte / but I haue ſene none mended. &c.
         
         
            ¶ The warrybrede / and the remedy therfore.
            THere be beeſtes that wyll haue warry bredes in dyuers partyes of theyr bodye and legges / 

and this is the remedye. Caſt hym downe and bynde his foure fete to gydre / and take a culture or a payre of tonges or ſuche an other yren / & make it glowyng hote / and yf it be a longe warrybrede: ſere it harde of by the bodye / and yf it be in the begynnynge / and be but flatte / than lay the hote yron vpon it and ſere it to the bare ſkynne / and it wyll be hole for euer / be it horſe or beſte.
         
         
            ¶ The foule / and the remedy therfore.
            THere be beſtes that wyll haue the foule / and that is bytwene the cleeſe / ſometyme before / and ſometyme behynde / and it wyll ſwell and cauſe hym to halte / and this is the remedy. Caſt hym down and bynde his foure fete to gyder / and take a rope of heare / or a hey rope / harde wrythen to gyder / and put it betwene his cleſe / and drawe the roope to and fro a good ſeaſon / tyll he blede well / and than lay to it ſofte made terre / and bynde a clothe aboute it / that no myre nor grauell come betwene the cleſe / and put hym in a paſture / or to ſtande ſtyll in the houſe / & he wyll be ſhortly hole.
         
         
            ¶ The goute without remedy.
            THere be beeſtes that wyll haue the gout / and moſt comynly in the hynder fete / & wyll cauſe hym to halte & go ſtarkely. And I neuer knewe man that coulde helpe it or fynde remedy therfore / but all onely to put hym in good graſſe and fede hym.
         
         
            
            ¶ To rere calues.
            IT is conuenyent for a huſbande to rere calues▪ and ſpecyally they that come bytwene Candelmaſſe and Maye / for that ſeaſon he may ſpare mylke beſt / and by that tyme the calfe ſhall be wayned there wyll be graſſe ynough to put hym vnto. And at wynter he wyll be bygge ynough to ſaue hym ſelfe amōge other beeſtes / with a lytell fauoure. And the dāme of the calfe ſhall bull agayn and brynge an other by the ſame tyme of the yere / and yf thou ſhalt tary tyll after May / the calfe wold be weyke in wynter / & the dāme wolde nat bull agayn but ofte tyme go bareyne. And yf thou ſhalte rere a calfe that cometh after Myghelmas / it wyll be coſtly to kepe the calfe all the wynter ſeaſon at hey / & the dāme at harde mete in the houſe / as they vſe in the playne champyon contreys. And a cowe ſhall gyue more mylke with a lytell graſſe and ſtrawe lyenge without in a cloſe / than ſhe ſhall do wt hey and ſtrawe lyenge in a houſe / for the harde meat dryeth vp the mylke. But he yt hathe no paſture muſt do as he may / but yet is it better to the huſband to ſell thoſe calues than to rere them bycauſe of the coſt / and alſo for the profyte of the mylke to his houſe / & the rather the cowe wyll take the bull. If the huſband goo with an oxe plough / it is conuenyent that he rere two oxe calues / & two cow calues at the leſt to vphold his ſtocke / and yf he may do mo? it wyll be more profyte. And it is better to wayne thy calues at gras than at harde mete / yf they wente to graſſe before. And that man that may haue a paſture for his kyen & an other

for his calues / & water in theym bothe / than may he rere & brede good beſtes with lyght coſt. And yf thou wayne thy calues with hey / it wyll make them haue great belyes / & the rather they wyll rotte whan they come to graſſe / and in wynter they wolde be put in a hous by them ſelfe & gyuen hey on the nyghtes / & put in a good paſture on the day / and they ſhall be moche better to handell whan they ſhall be kye or oxen.
         
         
            ¶ To gelde calues.
            IT is tyme to gelde his oxe calues in the olde of the mone / whan they be ten dayes or. xx. dayes olde▪for than it is leſte ieopardy / and the oxe ſhall be the more hyer and the longer of body / and the lenger horned / and that may be well proued to take two oxe calues bothe of one kynde / one makyng / and bothe of one age / gelde one of them / and let the other go forth & be a bull. And put them both in one paſture tyll they be foure or fyue yere olde / and than ſhall ye ſe the oxe caife farre greater euery waye than the bull / there is no cauſe but the geldynge / and yf thou geld them not tyll they be a yere olde / there is more ieopardy / he ſhal be leſſe of body / and ſhorter horned.
         
         
            ¶ Horſes and mares to drawe.
            A Huſband may not be without horſes and mares or both / and ſpecyally yf he go with a hors plough / he muſt haue bothe his horſes to drawe / and his mares to brynge coltes to vpholde his ſtocke / and

yet at many tymes they may drawe well / yf they be well handled. But they may not beare ſackes / nor be rydden vpon no iourneys whan they be with foole / & ſpecyally whā they haue gone with foole. xx. or. xxiii. wekes / for than is the greateſt ieopardy. For and ſhe be rydden vpon and ſet vp hote / or turned out & take colde / ſhe wyll caſt her foole / the whiche wolde be a greate loſſe to the huſbande. For ſhe wyll labour and beare whan ſhe hath fooled / and drawe whan ſhe is with foole as wel as the hors. It is cōuenient for the huſbande to knowe whan his mare wolde be horſed. It is the comyn ſayenge / that ſhe wyll take the hors within ix. or x. dayes nexte after that ſhe hath fooled but that ſayenge I holde not with for & ſhe ſo do / ſhe wyll not holde therto / for the hors doth dryue her to it But. xx. dayes after is tymely ynough to brynge her to a hors / for ſhe wyl not hold to it / except ſhe be kene of horſyng & that ſhall ye knowe by her ſhap / for that wyl twyrl

For it is better to kepe the hors from the mares / than to go with theym for dyuers cauſes / & ſpecyally he ſhall be more luſty / & the moo hors coltes ſhall he gete. But he that hath very many mares may not alwaye attende them / but let them go togyder & take as god ſendes it Some men holde an opynyon / y• put a hors to a mare in the begynnynge of the mone after it be pryme / & he ſhall gete a hors foole. And ſome men ſaye the cōtrary that and he be put to the mare in the olde of the mone he ſholde gere hors fooles. And I ſaye it maketh no

And me ſemeth that thoſe men that holde y• opynyon ſpeke ſophiſtically / that yf ſo be they layd any wagers ther vpon / that they ſhold bothe wynne in theyr own conceyte by this reaſon. ¶ whether it were get in the new of the mone or in the old of the mone / it is a hors fole bycauſe a hors gate it / though it be a fely fole & it is a mares fole bycauſe a mare foled it / though it be a hors colte, And ſo (diuerſis reſpectibꝰ) theyr opynyōs may be true. But of one thynge I am certayne▪ that ſome one hors wyll get more hors fooles than ſome other horſe wyll do / and lykewyſe a mare wyll bere mo mare foles / than ſom other mare wyll do / though they be horſed bothe with one horſe. Me ſemeth there is no reaſon why / but y• luſtynes of y• nature of bothe partyes whether of them ſhall haue the dominacyon. But and ye haue mares of dyuers colours▪ thā do as I do / ſeuer them in dyuers parcels / and put to your whyte mares a gray hors / or a whyte hors that hath no whyte rathe in y• forhede / & to your graye mares a whyte hors / ſo that he be nat al white ſkynned about the mouth. And to your mares of colour that haue no

whyte vpon theym a coloured horſe that hath moche whyte on hym / and to your coloured mares of mayne whyte a horſe of coloure of mayne whyte. And thus ſhall ye haue well coloured coltes / it maketh no mater of what coloure the horſe be of / ſoo he be neyther whyte nor grey. For and ye put a whyte horſe to a coloured mare / ſhe ſhall haue mooſt comynly a ſandy colte lyke an yren grey / neyther lyke ſyre nor dame. How be it I haue ſeen and knowen many mares that wyll haue theyr colte lyke the horſe that gate it / the whiche is agaynſt kynde of mares / for a man may rather gete one good horſe than many good mares.

            IT is leſſe hurte to a manne to haue his cowe to caſte her calfe / than an ewe to caſte her lambe For the calfe wyll ſouke as moche mylke or it be able to kyll as it is worthe / and of the ewe cometh no profyte of the mylke but the lambe. Howe be it they vſe in ſome places to mylke theyr ewes whan they haue wayned theyr lambes / but that is greate hurte to the ewes / and wyll cauſe theym that they wyll not take the ramme at the tyme of the yere for pouertye / but go ba

But that is not beſt / for that cauſeth the bowes to ſlaue downe the neyther parte / and pulleth away the barke from the body of the tree the whiche wyll cauſe the tree to be holowe in that place in tyme comynge / and many tymes it ſhall hyn der hym. And therfore / let hym begyn at the nethermoſt bough fyrſt / and with a lyght axe / for an hande to cut the bough on both ſydes a fote or two fote frō the body of the tree. And ſpecyally cut it more on the nether ſyde than on the ouer ſyde / ſo that the boughe fall nat ſtreyghte downe but turne on the ſyde / and

than ſhall it not ſlaue nor breke no barke. And euery boughe wyll haue a newe hede / and bere moche more wode / and by thy wyll withoute thou muſt nedes do it / croppe not thy tree / nor ſpecyally hede hym whan the wynde ſtandeth in the north / nor in the eeſt. And beware that thou croppe hym not nor hede hym (ſpecyally) in ſappe tyme / for than wyll he dye within a fewe yeres after / yf it be an oke.

And yf there be any okes bothe great and ſmall / fell them and pyll them / and ſell the barke by it ſelfe / and than ſort the trees / the polles by them ſelfe / ye myddell ſort by them ſelfe / & the greateſt by thē ſelfe / & than ſell them by ſcores or halfe ſcores or hondredes / as thou mayſt / and to fell it harde by ye erth / for one fote nexte to the erthe is worth two fote in the toppe / and to cutte thy tymber longe ynoughe that thou leue no tymber in the toppe.

And as ſhortly as it is fallen? let it be caryed away or the ſprynge come vp / for els the catell that doth cary ye wode wyll eat ye ſprynge / and whan the toppe is eaten or broken it is a greate lette / hurte / and hynderaunce / of the goodnes of the ſprynge / for than where it is eaten / it burges out of many braunches / and not ſo fayre as the fyrſt wolde haue ben. A parke is beſt kept whan there is neyther man / dogge / nor four foted beſte therin / except dere. And ſo is a ſprynge beſt kepte where there is neyther man nor four foted beſtes within the hedge / but and there be moche gras & thou were lothe to loſe it / than put in calues newly wayned & take frō theyr dāmes and alſo waynyng coltes or horſes not paſt a yere of age. And let thy calues be taken awaye at Maye / the

coltes maye go longer for catynge of any wode / but there is ieopardy both for calues / foles and coltes / for tyckes / or for beynge louſye / y• whiche wyll kyll them yf they be nat taken hede vnto. And ſeuen yere is the leſt that it wyll ſaue it ſelfe / but ten yere is beſt. And than the vnder bowes wolde be cut away / and made kyddes thereof / and the other wyll growe moche the better and faſter. And yf the vnder bowes be nat cut awaye / they wyll dye / and than they be loſt / & greate hurte to the ſprynge / for they take awaye the ſappe that ſholde cauſe the ſprynge to grow better.

And for all maner of apples? the crabtre ſtocke is beſt.

            And therfore thou mayſt not ſet the barkes mete on the vtter ſyde / but on the ynner ſyde / than pull away thy wedge / and it wyll ſtande moche faſter. Thanne take tough clay lyke marley & laye it vpon the ſtocke

For yf one of them ſholde vſe to deceyue ye other? he deceyueth hym ſelf / & he is nat lyke to thryue / & therfore they muſt be true eyther to other.

In the whiche booke he ſhewed that yf they were wowed / moued or ſtyred by any mā after ſuche a maner as he there ſhewed yt they ſholde wt ſtande it / in ye which boke he ſhewed ſo many ways how a man ſholde attayne to his purpoſe to brynge a woman to vyce / the which wayes were ſo naturall & the wayes to come to theyr purpoſe was ſo ſubtylly contryued & craftly ſhewed / that hard it wolde be for

any woman to reſiſt or deny theyr deſyre. And by the ſayd boke hathe made bothe the men & the women to knowe more vyces / ſubteltye & crafte / than euer they ſholde haue knowen yf the booke had nat ben made / the whiche booke he named hym ſelfe the knyghte of the toure.

            ¶ How a man ſholde pray.
            IT is to be vnderſtande that there be dyuers maner of prayenges. Quedam publica / et quedam priuata. That is to ſay / ſome openly / & ſome pry
                  •
               atly. Prayer openly muſt nedes be done in the chyrche by the mynyſtratours of the ſame before the people. For it is done for all the comynaltye / and therfore the people in that ought to conferme thē ſelfe to the ſayd mynyſtratours / and there to be preſent to pray vnto god after a due maner. Oratio priuata. The prayer pryuatly done / ought to be done in ſecrete places for

two cauſes. ¶ For prayer eleuateth and lyfteth vp a mānes mynde to god / and the mynde of man is ſoner and better lyfte vp whan he is in a preuy place and ſeperate frome multytude of people. An other cauſe is to auoyd vaynglory that myght lyghtly enſue or ryſe thervpon whan it is done openly / and therof ſpeketh our ſauyour where he ſayeth. Cum oratis non eritis ſicut ipocrite qui amant in ſynagogis / et in angulis platearum ſtantes orare. That is to ſaye / whan ye praye: be nat you as the ypocrytes? the whiche loue to ſtande in theyr ſynagoges and corners of hye wayes to pray. ¶ Alſo ſome folkes pray with the lyppes or mouth / and not with the herte / of whom ſpeketh our lorde by his prophete.

Longe quippe a deo eſt animus / q in oratione cogitacionibꝰ ſeculi fuerit occupatus. His ſoule is farre frome god that in his prayer his mynde is occupyed in warkes of the worlde. There be other that praye bothe with the mouthe & herte / of whom ſpeketh ſaynt Johan. x. Ueri adoratores / adorabūt patrē in ſp̄u et veritate The trew prayers wyll worſhyp the father of heuen in ſpyryt and with trouth. Iſodorus ſayth.

And how he reyſyd Lazare from dethe to lyfe / with many more myracles that be innumerable to be reherſed. And alſo to remēbre the ſpecyall poyntes of his paſſyon how he was ſolde and betrayed of Judas / & taken by the iewes & broughte before Pylate / than to kynge Herode / and to byſhop Cayphas / & than to Pylate agayne that iuged hym to dethe / and how he was bounde to a pyller & ſcourged hym and bobbed hym / mocked hym / ſpytte in his face / crowned hym with thornes / and cauſed hym to beare the croſſe to the mounte of Caluary / whervpon he was nayled bothe handes and fete / and wounded to the harte with a ſharpe ſpere / and ſo ſuffred dethe. And how he ſet out the ſoules of our forefaders forth of hell. How he roſe from deth to lyfe / and how ofte he apered to his dyſcyples & other moo.

            IT is oft tymes ſeen / that the holyer that a man is / the more he is tempted / & he that ſo is / may thanke good therof / for god of his goodnes and grace hath not gyuen to the deuyll auctoryte nor power / to attempte any man ferther & aboue that / that he that is ſo tempted may withſtande. For ſaynt Gregorye ſayth. Non eſt timendum hoſtis / qui non poteſt vincere niſi volentem. An enemy is not to be dradde / the whiche may not be ouercome / but yf a man by wyllynge. And it is to preſume / that he that is ſo tempted ſtandeth in y• ſtate of grace. For ſaynt Ambroſe ſayth Illos diabolus vexare necligit quos iure hereditario ſe poſſidere ſentit. ¶ The deuyll deſpyſeth to vexe or trouble thoſe the whiche he feleth hymſelfe to haue in poſſeſſyon by ryght herytaunce. And yf thou be ſo tēpted / vexed / or troubled I ſhall ſhewe vnto y• two verſes / that and thou do therafter / thou ſhalt be eaſed of thy temtacyon / and haue greate thanke and laude of god and rewarde therfore / theſe be the verſes. Hoſtis non ledit / niſi cum tēptatus obedit. Eſt leo ſi ſedit / ſi ſtat quaſi muſca recedit. That is to ſaye / the ghooſtly enemy hurteth not / but whan he that is tempted obeyeth to his temptacyon / than this ghooſtly enemy playeth the lyon / yf that he that is tempted ſyt ſtyll & obey to hym. And yf he that is tempted / ſtande ſtyfly agaynſt hym / the ghooſtly enemy flyeth away lyke a flye. This me ſemeth may be well proued by a famylyer enſample. As a lorde had a caſtell / and delyuered it to a capytayn to kepe / yf there come enemyes to the

caſtell / and call to the capytayn and byd hym delyuer them this caſtell. The capytayne cometh and openeth theym the gates / & delyuereth the keyes. Now is this caſtell ſoone wonne / & this capytayne is a falſe traytour to the lorde. But let the capytayn arme hym ſelfe and ſhyt the gates / & ſtand ſtyfly vpon the walles / & to cōmaūde them to auoyde at theyr peryll / they wyll nat tary to make any aſſaute. Ryght ſo euery man is capytayne of his owne ſoule / & yf thy ghoſtely enemy come & tempte the / & thou that arte capytayn of thyne owne ſoule wyll open the gates & delyuer hym y• keys & let hym in / thy ſoule is ſone taken pryſoner / & thou a falſe traitour to thy ſoule / & worthy to be punyſſhed in pryſon for euer. And yf thou arme thy ſelfe & ſtand ſtyfly agaynſt hym / and wyll nat conſent to hym / he wyll auoyde & flye away / & thou ſhalte haue a greate rewarde for withſtandynge of the ſayd temptacyon.

            ¶ The thyrde maner of almes.
            ERrantem corrigere / et in viam veritatis reducere. To correct a myſdoer / and to brynge hym into the waye of ryght. It is to be vnderſtande that

there be thre maner of correccyons. The fyrſt correccyon is of an enmy / the ſecond is of a frende / and the thyrde correccyon is of a iuſtyce. The fyrſt ſayth Criſoſtome. Corripe nō vt hoſtis expetens vindictā / ſed vt medicus inſtituens medicinam. Correct nat as an enemy doynge vengeauns / but as a phyſycyon or ſurgyon: mynyſtrynge or gyuynge a medycyne. To the ſeconde ſayth Salomon. Plus proficit amica correctio

                correctio turbulenta. A frendely correccyon profyteth more than a troublous correccyon / for & yf thou ſpeke curteyſly to a man that hath offended / and with ſwete wordes of compaſſyon / he ſhall rather be conuerted by them / than with hye wordes of greate punyſſhement. And Iſodorus ſayeth. Qui per verba blanda caſtigatus non corrigetur / acrius neceſſe eſt vt arguatur. He that wyll nat be chaſtyſed by fayre wordes? it is neceſſary that he be more hardlyer and ſtraitlyer reproued or punyſſhed. To the thyrde ſayth ſaynt Jerome. Equū iudiciū eſt vbi nō ꝑſona ſed oꝑa cōſiderātur. There is an euyll iudgement / where the perſone is nat regarded / but the warkes are cōſydred And alſo it is writen. Reddet vnicu

As thoſe be better that be chaſtyſed by loue? there be many mo that be chaſtyſed by feare. For and they feared nat the punyſſhement of the lawe? there wolde be but a fewe chaſtyſed by loue. And ſaynt Gregory ſayth. Faciētis procul dubio culpā habet qui qd poteſt corrigere negligit emendare / et illicita nō prohibere conſenſus err

            IN myne opynyon / it is to be in deſpayre of the mercy of god. ¶ And therfore what ſo euer thou haſt done or offēded god / in worde / warke / thought / or dede / be neuer i deſpayre for it, for Iſodorus ſayth Qui veniā de p

                de culpa cadit. He y• deſpayreth to haue forgyuenes of his ſynnes? he ſynneth more in deſpayring than he dyd in ye ſynne doynge. For ſaynt Jerom ſayth. Magis offendebat Judas deū in hoc qd ſe ſuſpendit?

               tōres ad penitentiam. I am nat come to call ryghtwyſe men: but to cal ſynners to do penaūce. For thou can nat ſo ſone crye god mercy wt thy herte / but he is as redy to chaūge his ſentence & to graunte ye mercy & forgyuenes of all thy ſynnes. For ſaynt Auſtyn ſayth. Sicut ſcintilla ignis in medio maris? ſic om̄is impietas viri ad miſericordiā dei. As a ſparke of fyre is in cōparyſō able to drye vp all the water in the ſee? no more is all the wyckednes of man vnto the mercyfulnes of god.

And therfore it is cōuenyent that a man ſholde be penytente / contryte / & aſke god mercy & forgyuenes of his ſynnes & offences that he hathe done / wherof ſpeketh Cryſoſtome. Nemo ad deum aliquando flens acceſſit quod nō poſtulauerit accepit. No mā hath gone any tyme wepynge to god / but he hathe taken or had that thynge that he hath aſked. And ſaynt Bernarde ſayth.
