Honorable Lady, the Lady knowles.
            
               DEath with his Darte hath vs berefte,
               a Gemme of worthy fame,
               A Pearle of price, an Ouche of praiſe,
               the Lady Knovvles by name.
            
            
               A Myrroure pure of womanhoode,
               a Bootreſſe and and a ſtay,
               To all that honeſt were, ſhe was
               I ſay both locke and kaye.
            
            
               Among the Troupes of Ladies all,
               and Dames of noble race,
               She counted was, (and was in deede)
               in Ladie Fortunes grace.
            
            
               In fauoure with our noble Queene,
               aboue the common ſorte,
               With whom ſhe was in credit greate,
               and bare a comely porte.
            
            
               There ſeemde between our Queene & Death,
               Contencion for to be,
               Which of them both more entier loue,
               to her could teſtifie.
            
            
               The one in ſtate did her aduaunce,
               and place in dignitie,
               That men thereby might knowe, to doe,
               what princes able be.
            
            
               Death made her free from worldly carke,
               from ſicknes, paine and ſtrife.
               And hath ben as a gate, to bringe
               her to eternall life.
            
            
               By Death therfore ſhe hath receiu'de,
               a greater boone I knowe:
               For ſhe hath made a chaunge, whoſe bliſſe,
               no mortall wight can ſhowe.
            
            
               She here hath loſte the companie,
               of Lords and Ladies braue,
               Of huſband, Children, frendes and kinne,
               and Courtly ſtates full graue.
            
            
               In Lieu wherof, ſhe gained hath
               the bleſſed companie
               Of Sainctes, Archangels, Patriarches,
               and Angelles in degree.
            
            
               With all the Troupes Seraphicall,
               which in the heauenly Bower,
               Melodiouſly with one accord,
               Ebuccinate Gods power.
            
            
               Thus are we ſure: for in this world
               ſhe led a life ſo right,
               That ill report could not diſtaine,
               nor blemiſh her with ſpight.
            
            
               She traced had ſo cunningly,
               the hath of vertues lore,
               Prefixing God omnipotent,
               her godly eyes before:
            
            
               And all her dedes preciſelie were,
               ſo rulde by reaſons Squire,
               That all and ſome might her beholde,
               from vice ſtill to retire.
            
            
               The vertues all, the Muſes nine,
               and Graces three agreed,
               To lodge within her noble breaſt,
               while ſhe in Earth did feede.
            
            
               A head ſo fraight and beautified,
               with wit and counſaile ſounde,
               A minde ſo cleane deuoide of guyle,
               is vneth to be founde.
            
            
               But gone ſhe is, and left the Stage
               of this moſt wretched life,
               Wherin ſhe plaid a ſtately part,
               till cruell Fates with knife:
            
            
               Did cut the line of life in twaine,
               who ſhall not after goe?
               When time doth come, we muſt all hence,
               Experience teacheth ſo.
            
            
               Examples daily manifolde,
               before our eyes we ſee,
               Which put vs in remembraunce,
               of our fragilitie.
            
            
               And bid vs watch at euery tide,
               for Death our lurking foe,
               Sith dye we muſt, moſt certainely,
               but when, we do not knowe.
            
            
               Som which to day are luſty Brutes,
               of age and courage ripe,
               To morow may be layd full lowe,
               by Death his greuous gripe.
            
            
               Reſpect and parcialitie
               of perſons is there none,
               For King, or Kaiſer, rich or poore,
               wiſe, fooliſh, all is one.
            
            
               God graunt that we here left behinde,
               this Ladies ſteppes may treade,
               To liue ſo well, to die no worſe,
               Amen, as I haue ſaide.
            
            
               Then maugre Death, we ſhall be ſure,
               when corps in earth is cloſde,
               Amonge the ioyes celeſtiall,
               our Soule ſhalbe repoſde.
            
            FINIS.
            
               Tho. Nevvton.
