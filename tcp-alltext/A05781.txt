               Pardon (Princesse) though I conceale thy name.
               Thy Traine, and Paragons of high degree
               
                  Homer and Virgill, vsed to doe the same,
               And Astrophill when hee decyphred thee,
               
                  Baxtero Mastix may disparage mee,
               That I dare make thee subiect of my pen,
               At whose aspect Poets amazed be,
               As things beyond the reach, of priuate men.
               But wonder, Learning, witte, Fame, Wisdome, Time,
               Shall glorifie the subiect of this Rime.

                  Endimion tould me should attend on thee:
               He consecrat's Ourania to thy name,
               Without respect of paedanticall fee,
               But if perchaunce great Astrophill thou see,
               And Fates with-holde thee from Endymion:
               Hee humbly sues that hee released be,
               Of arrogancy, and proesumption,
               That he without his knights iniunction
               Should dedicate vnto thy princely Shrine,
               The treasurie, and hidden function,
               Of Iehouahs Hexameron diuine.
               And he that whilome liu'd in Graecian deep's,
               Craues helpe of thee, as he in English creep's.

               And mightie Cynthia with her blessed Traine.
            
            
               Shee is well knowne whom all the world admires
               For vertuous life, and prudent modestie;

               It greeues my heart to se the gentle Swayne,
               That kept his tender Lambes on Ida Mount:
               And brought them downe againe into the plaine,
               To take their pleasure by the siluered Fount,
               Folding them all, and taking iust account,
               Least one of them by Carelesse ouersight
               Should wandring perish in the darke-some night.
            
            
               It greeues my heart (I say) to heare his moane,
               Fast by the walles of Troy where once he dwelt:
               With wringing hands and many a greeuous groane,
               He did expresse the miseries he felt.
               A heart of flint I thinke would surely melt,
               To see a gentle Shepheard thus cast downe,
               By Enuies practise and great Cynthyas frowne.
            
            
               You mightie Princes and high Potentates,

               The greatest princes of the Oulderne times:
               Bereauing Monarchs of th' Imperiall Crowne,
               Against their persons vrging fayned Crymes,
               As you may read in Poets golden Rymes.

               In Troy Towne scituate in Cambria,
               
               There dwelt this Sheapherd of a gentle race;
               Neer fronting vpon great Mongomria,
               
               Where Princely Arthur kept his courtly place,
               Guiding great Albion with his golden Mace,
               Where Knights and Ladies cladde in princely wee
                     •
                  s,
               Shew'd testimonie of their worthy deedes.
            
            
               
               There did this gentle Shepheard feed his flocke;
               There tuned hee his well contryued Reede:
               Sitting on top of highest Ida rocke,
               Suffring his tender Lambes meane while to feede,
               VVhiles he, clad in his homely Countrey weede,
               Sang Madrigals and Stanzies of great worth,
               And descanted to bring his Musicke forth.
            
            
               Well could he sing diuine and sacred layes,
               With blessed notes as Poets did record,
               In siluered lines painting high Ionahs praise.
               And eke the death of Christians dying Lord.
               Such Musicke did he oft his 
                     ••
                  ocke afford.
               As made them leaue their foode to listen well,
               As if they were inchaunted with the spell.
            
            
               
                  Satyrs and Siluans at the harmonie,
               Sometime came darting from the darkesome Groue,
               Approouing oft the chaunting melodie,
               And with their harsh and rurall voyces stroue,
               To sound the praises of celestiall Ioue;
               But when their Pipes and voices disagreed,
               They held their peace and cast away their reed.
            
            
               Sometimes he made the Rocks for to rebound,
               With Eccho of his Notes; sometime the dales,
               And woods, and springs, to yeeld a burbling sound,
               As beaten with reflexe of Madrigales;
               
                  Sibillas Oracles, and prophets 
                     •
                  ales:
               Which shew the way to immortalitie,
               In perfect Hymnes of true diuinitie.
            
            
               So well he could his warbling Notes diuide,
               That other Shepheards did his 
                     •
                  ayes admire,
               And set their Notes, as he their Pipes did guide,
               Vntill they could vnto the like aspire:
               Yet neuer tooke he recompence or hire,
               But as he lay vpon th' Idaean hill,
               He dayly sounded lowde his

               Till Cynthia walking with her blessed Traine,
               Approach'd the shepheard and his melodie.
               Where she obseruing well the Harmonie,
               With Maiestie diuine and princelie grace,
               Retyr'd her selfe and pauz'd a little space.
            
            
               I well did view the Coronet she ware,
               With Diamonds and Saphyres orient,
               A Carkenet most pretious and rare,
               Fretized with Carbuncles which Hebae sent,
               (The same which Pyrocles did first inuent)
               Did circle twise, her sacred necke, & brest,
               In which the Muses, and the Graces, rest.
            
            
               Betweene her paps a lustrious Diamond;
               Link'd to her Carkenet by curious Arte,

               So placed was, that light it might imparte,
               To all inferiour Orbs in darkest night,

               Onely some thinke he spent too much in vaine,
               That was his fault: but giue his honour due,
               Learned he was, iust, affable and plaine;
               No traytor, but euer gratious, and true:
               Gainst Princes peace, a plot he neuer drewe.
               But as they be deceiu'd that too much trust:
               So trusted hee some men, that prou'd vnjust.

               The Iewels which they wore gaue such a shine,
               Vpon a suddaine to the sillie Swaine,

               So great a luster longer to sustaine,
               Downe fell his pipes, dead was his musick

                   her face,
               But straite they stande amazed in the place.
            
            
               But Cynthia stoop'd and tooke him vp againe,
               And rub'd his Temples with her tender hand:
               Each Ladie stroue to take the greatest paine,
               To rouze him from his Trance, and make him stand.
               Each way to saue his life, was deepely scand,
               But all in vaine, till Cynthia layde aside,
               Her Maiestie, that daunteth rurall pride.
            
            
               At last the sillie Shepheard gan reuiue,
               Yet as amaz'd he knew not where he was:
               But stood as one halfe dead, and halfe aliue,
               As often times we see it come to passe,
               (For mortall man compared is to grasse)
               
                  Flora cannot susteine the parching heate,
               Of Phoebus beames vncessantly to beat.
            
            
               But shee that knew the cause of his distresse,
               Releiued him with words of sweetest grace
               And saide: Thou gentle Swayne, the Gods thee blesse,
               Be of good cheere: Cast sorrowe from thy face:
               Keepe on thy Laye, and blessed be thy race,

               Thus did her gracious words, the Shepheard cure.
               Who looking vp with countenance demure,

               For learning had in admiration:
               The shine of whose illustrious reflexe,
               May dazle wits of high inuention:

               Pardon poore Shepheards rude, and worthlesse Rymes,

               O let me liue I pray thee, on this Hill,

               This modest sute, (quoth Cynthia) is not fit
               For thee to craue; nor for my state to graunt:
               Thou oughtst in higher straine t'aduance thy wit,
               And sacred Notes mongst learned men to chaunt;
               Mee list not to thy face thy Musicke vaunt.
               I like it well, and this may thee suffice,
               Songs of no worth I vtterly dispise.
            
            
               If thou accountst my iudgement any thing,
               And deemst mee farre remote from flatterie,
               Let me entreate thee once againe to sing,
               Melodious Notes of sweetest Harmonie.
               For such doe please the highest Deitie,
               And comfort vs after our weary Howers,
               Which we haue spent in gathering Gilliflowers.

               Now to proceed: Blessed immortall Pan,
                  Angels not made before Heauen.
               
               Was not alone before this world began,
               Yet were no Angels as then created,
               Nor Angels Offices destinated.
               Nor could their attendance doe him pleasure,
               In whom consisted all blessed treasure,
               All comprehending Pan was then no where.
               A certaine place must euery Angel beare.
               Not circumscriptiue but definitiue.

               Making one Pan in perfect vnitie,
               Whole Pan in eache, and each of these in Pan,
               
               A mystery that passeth reach of Man,
               These were sufficient of themselues to frame,
               This glorious Engine which we Cosmos name.
                     Cosmos: the world.
               
               Who when he pleas'd to make his glory know'n
               And haue his power manifestly show'n,
               He putteth on triumphant Maiestie,
               That all his creatures might him glorifie.
               
                  And at one instant with his onely word,
               As a most mightie, and imperiall Lord,

               At once were made in substance as they bee.
               Yet was this frame a Masse vnpolished,
               Void of all forme, rude and vngarnished,
               Water, Earth, Ayre, Fire, togither blended,
               As if Confusion were the thing intended.
               But mightie Ruach spread his powerfull wings,
               Vpon this Masse, of all confused things;
               And kept it warme, making it apt to take,
               Such different forme as pleased Pan to make.
               So mightie Ioue commaunded separation,
               Twixt light and heauie things for generation.
               And of light Bodies made a Circumference,
               In circle wise from th'earth for difference.
               And made the earth both fast and permanent,
               The Center of th'vniuersall continent.

                  Sol. ☉
                  Phoebus is next which we call Sol, the Sunne,
               Without whose light the world were cleane vndone
               Without whose heate nothing that liu's could liue,
               For Light and Heate, No Planet else doth giue.
               He is the Fost'rer of this earthly Round,
               And all the creatures that therein be found,
               Piercing all things belowe with powerfull Raies
               (Harke how the chirping Birds do chaunt his praise)
               He swiftly runnes ouer th'vniuersall,
               In twentie foure howres a day naturall
               And yet he keepes a station diuine,
               Staying one Month in euerie Zodiake Signe.
               Producing creatures of such varietie,
               As mou's all men t'admire his Deitie.
               No Starre within the VVelkin taketh place,
               But borrowes light of his resplendent grace.
               The mightie Ocean is nourished by him,
               
                  Phaebe her selfe without his light is dim.
               
                  Ioues winged messenger sweete Mercurie,
               
               Is fed by Phoebus blessed harmonie.
               
                  Venus the darling to the god of warre,
               Doth neuer rest if Phoebus be too farre.
               The bottom of the Sea, the fish, the sand,
               Receiue their comfort from his blessed hand.
               
                  Tellus her selfe, and Flora in her pride,
               Die and consume, if Phoebus looke aside.
               The Diamond, Saphyr, and Rubie red,
               By Phoebus scorching heate are ingendred:
               The golden mettals in the deepest Mine,
               Do consecrate their being to his Shrine.
               
                  Ceres that Queene doth fade and pine away,
               If mightie Phoebus hide his golden ray.
               Yea Bacchus and Pales, are soone withered,
               If Phoebus in the Spring doe hide his head.
               Aeternall night shall all the world oppresse,
               If Phoebus doe with-draw his golden Tresse.
               
                  There was a Light before there was a Sunne,
               And Day and Night before Phoebus begunne.
               Yet is the Sunne the cause of Day and Night.Day and night before the sun was made, Genes, 1.
               
               Shepheards diuine must iudge the reason right,
               They say a glimering light did whirling wend,
               From East to West, vnto none other end,
               But to supplie for a time Phoebus place,
               Till he was made to runne his princely race.
               But then this whirling light that Heau'n graced,
               Contracted was, and in great Phoebus placed,
               Who euer since was cause of Night and Day,
               As learned Shepheards sounden in their lay.
               Next is the Orbe, and Spheare of Cytharaeae,

                  Cupids mother, Diana's mortall foe,
               Cause of most warres which Gallants vndergoe.
               When bloodie fight the god of warre hath grieued,
               The ioyes of Venus hath him oft relieued:
               Therefore hath Venus Vulcans bed forsaken,
               And dreadfull Mars his lodging vndertaken,
               But why doth Beauties Queene loue man so well?
               Whose words are wounds, whose frowns do death foretell
               Shee Triumpheth in his Coniunction,
               She's grieued at his opposition:
               When he is merrie, then shee laughes or smiles,
               And with conceits the longest nights beguiles.
               Can there

                  e any perfect Sympathie,
               T'wixt bloodie warres, and Chamber-melodie?
               Else Pan forbid: but let vs vnderstand,
               The matter well that we do take in hand.
               T'wixt warres and peace can be no Sympathie,
               But man and woman are in peace pardie.
               Great Pan ordain'd as Shepheards do relate,
               Contrarie Elements without debate,
               Should altogither in one bodie dwell,
               Louing each other, and agreeing well:
               So though Mars be bloodie in his Center,
               Yet is he pacified if Venus enter.
               
                  Againe faire Venus with smyling pleasance
               Know's how t'asswage his angrie countenance,
               So that there is a perfect harmonie,
               Twixt white and blacke directly contrarie,
               Which being mixed do agree for euer,
               Whom neither Art, or Nature, can disseuer.
               And this is the reason, as shepheards skan,
               Why a faire Ladie loues a Martiall man.
               Next comes to our consideration,
               
                  Mercurius. ☿
                  Mercurie fraught with sophistication.
               Nimble, ingenious, busie as the Bees,
               Wittie, as an Ape, to follow what he sees.

               At dice▪ Cards, and gaming all the day long.

               VVhy these be Mercurial, if thou wouldest weet!
               It's because Mercurius hath winged feet,

               As Planets superior worke reuolution.
               Faithfully keeping his circular Spheere,

               All these shee cherisheth, as if they were
               The noblest creatures in the highest Sphere.
               She giu's them gifts that most of them should yawne,
               At each full Sea for comforting their spawne.
               And to the sea she giues dayly motion,
               To ebbe and flow to voyde corruption.
               She giu's her fertill generation,
               And perfect Meanes of Vegitation.
               So that Thetis hath more prouision,
               of fish and foule in great diuision:
               Then all th'inhabitable Earth can show,
               Or skill of mortall man can know.
               But all that of the Sea is said, or done,

               But here some may a question propound,
               Requiring a Philosopher profound,
               Why is the Ayres middle Region,
               Coldest in the burning Sommer season?
               And in the Winter time more temperate,
               Raine (and not Haile) fitter to generate?
               Answere. Two contraries doe alwayes flie,Answer.
               
               The one from the other naturally,
               So when it is extreame hottest weather,
               The cold collecteth his forces together,
               And keepes himselfe close in his owne defence,
               Least heate should surprize or expell him thence.
               Then is he colder then he was before,
               Hauing abundance of coldnesse in store.
               But if that heate be from him deuided,
               His force is dissolued: Our poynt decided,
               Now is the discourse of the water ended.

               Thou speakest as perfect Ciceronian,
               As a Monkey iabbereth Italian.
               If I demaund how thou attain'dst thy skill,
               Thou simply answerest: it was Ioues will▪
               
               It came to thee by inspiration:
               And by a secret Reuelation.
               Thus thou obtain'dst thy Consecration,
               By an extraordinarie vocation.
               Contrarie to the sacred Regiment,
               Setled by Iesus Christ, and parmanent.
               But for the Registers of Antiquitie,
               And interpreters of Diuinitie,
               
                  The holy fathers blessed Monuments,
               Which Christ hath vsed as his Instruments,
               To make diuine Theorems perspicuous.
               And obscure sentences illustrious:
               Thou do

                  st reiect them as ridiculous,
               And interpretations perillous.
               Thou onely read'st the inuectiues of T.C.
               
               Which by profound writers answered bee.
               Why without blushing dar'st thou discommend,
               The orders of the Church, or thus contend
               About high poynts beyond thine Element?
               Thy time in learning might be better spent.
               But well I know what brought thee to this vaine,
               Not conscionable zeale, but hope of gaine.
               And this thou shalt acknowledge euident,
               Vpon record as certaine Precedent.
               Thou that before with railing bitter words,
               Denied'st Christian Bishops to be Lords:
               And squared Cap, and Surplesse didst forsweare,
               Shunning the Ministers that did it weare,
               Saying t'was a Relique of Antichrist,
               Brought into the Church by the diuels high Priest.
               The Crosse in Baptisme, and Ring in mariage,
               Is a foolish toy, and meere Surplussage,
               The Booke of Common-prayer is tittle tattle,
               Much like to a Babies playing rattle.
               But now thou hast by thine owne subscription,
               Retracted thy former assertion.

               And what thou formerly hast contemned,
               As things by Christianitie condemned.
               By thy hand writing thou hast approoued,

                  Thine Audience demaund of thee the cause,
               Why thou subiects thy selfe vnto these lawes?

               Procured thee to perpetrate this crime.
               Out of thy mouth I straight do argue thee,
               Of false dissembling hypocrisie.
               For if it be direct iniquitie,
               Discording from true Christianitie;
               Why wilt thou thy conscience contaminate,
               And with thy pen and hand corroberate,

               Like the Camelion of the Ayre bred.
               Thou hast nor Arte, nor wit, to feed thy sheepe,
               No more then Wolfe, or Foxe thy lambs to keepe.
               Thou know'st no more the Scriptures to vnfolde,
               Then doth Aphron th'Alchimist to make golde.
               But flesh is fraile, and thou art loath to say,

               Returne therefore vnto thy trade againe,
               For in the Church thou labourest in vaine.

               Thus fram'd she was in iust proportion,
               Which made the world amaz'd to looke vpon.
               But for the Ornaments of her princely minde,
               For excellency were not farre behinde.
               The noble soule of Adam first created,

               Into her bodie, as blessed Adams was,
               But rather that creation came to passe,
               By propagation out of Adams soule.
               We finde no warrant for this in our rowle.
               For simple essence can no way generate,

                  But all was well, no terror was intended,
                  The Knight nor car'd, nor knew Endymion.

                  Prince of all Poets in Acadia,
                  
                  Magnanimous of euerlasting Fame,
                  Of chiefe regard, with famous Cynthia,

                  But when my Cynthia knew 'twas Astrophill,
                  
                  She ranne to claspe him in her daintie Armes,
                  But out alas, it passed mortall skill;
                  Inchaunted was the Knight with sacred Charmes.
                  His bodie dead of yore, the more our harmes.

                  Thrice Cynthia tri'd to folde him in her armes,
                  But all in vaine, she nothing comprehended:
                  Her vitall blood that all the bodie warmes.
                  Forsooke her veynes, and to her heart ascended.
                  For loe, she fainting fall's as life were ended:
                  Making most wofull lamentation,
                  Yet Astrophill still kept his station.

                  Amazed at her fall made such a crie,
                  As wak'd the Satyrs of Syluania.
