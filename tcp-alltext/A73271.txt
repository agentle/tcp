               BEFORE I entre to abridge the factes and geſtes of the Kynges and other perſones, within this Realme from Brutus, the firſt Kyng of the ſame: I purpoſe briefly to make a Deſcription of this noble Realme, gathered out of Polydore Virgil, reported in his worke of the Engliſhe hyſtorie, who ſaieth: That all Britayn, which by two names is called England and Scotland is an Iland in the Ocean ſea, ſituate ryght ouer againſt the Region of Gallia: one part of which Iſle Engliſhmen do inhabite: an other parte Scottes, the thirde parte walſhemen, and the fourth part Corniſhmen.

After theſe, there be vi. which border weſtward vpon wales, as Gloceſter▪ Hereford, worceſter, Salop, Stafforde, and Cheſter. Aboute the middle of the Region

Againſt the ſame, is the Biſhoprike of Durham, and Northumberlande, whiche boundeth vpon the Northe, in▪ the marches of Scotland. Thoſe ſhires be diuided into .xvii.

builded, that it ſeemeth rather a continuall ſtreete, then a Bridge. The Ocean ſea doeth bounde Englande, the firſt part of Britayne eaſt and South: wales, and Cornewall weſt. The riuer of Twede deuideth England and Scotland north. The length of the Iſland beginneth at Portſmouth in the ſouth part, and endeth at Twede in the Northe, conteinynge CCCxx. myles. This Realm aboue other is moſt fruitful on this ſyde Humbre: for beyōd it is fuller of mountaines. And although to the beholders of that countrey a far of, it may ſeme plaen, yet it is ful of many hils, & thoſe for the moſt part voyde of trees: the valleys wherof be very delectable, in habited for the moſt part by noble men, who accordynge to ancient and olde order, deſyre not to dwell in Cities, but nere vnto valleyes and riuers in ſeuerall villages: for aduoidyng of vehemēt wynds, becauſe ye Iland naturally is ſtormy. Humbre hath his beginnyng a littell on this ſyde yorke, and by and by runneth ſouthward and then holdeth his courſe eaſtward, and ſo into the main ſea, greatly increaſed by the ryuers of Dune and Trent. Trent beginneth a little from Stafforde, running through Darbyſhyre, and Leiceſterſhyre, paſſyng by Lichfielde and Notyngham on the right hande, & Dune on the left: ſo that both thoſe riuers do make an Ilande, which is called Auxolme,

and then ioynyng together on this ſyde King ſton vpon Hull, a goodly marchant towne, they fall into Humbre: by whiche riuer they may aryue out of Fraunce, Germanie, and Denmarke. England is fruitfull of beaſts, and aboundeth with cattell: wherby thinhabitauntes bee rather for the moſte graſiers, then ploughmen, becauſe they geue them ſelues more to fedyng, then to tyllage. So that almoſte the third part of the countrey is imployed to cattell, dere redde and fallow, goates (wherof there be ſtore in the north parts, and conies) for euery where ther is ioly maintenance of thoſe kyndes of beaſtes, becauſe it is full of great woddes, whereof there riſeth paſtyme of huntyng greatly exerciſed, ſpecially by the nobilitie and gentlemen.

               e or forelande, or an Iſle (as it were) on euery ſide it is compaſſed with the mayne ſea: except it be on the eaſt part with the riuer of Sabrine commonly called Seuerne, which deuideth wales from Englande. Althoughe ſome late writers affirme Hereford to be a bound betwene

wales and Englande, and ſaye, that wales beginueth at Chepſtoll, where the riuer Deye augmented with an other ryuer called Lugge, paſſyng by Hereford dothe runne into the ſea: which riuer riſeth in the middle of wales out of that hill (but vncertain whether out of that ſprynge) that Sabrine dothe, which Corn. Tacitus calleth Antona. For euen to that place there gothe a great arme of the ſea, which paſſeth through the land weſtward: on the right hand leaueth Cornewall, and on the left wales▪ whiche Topographye or deſcription, althoughe it bee newe, yet I thoughte good to ſolowe. Therfore Wales is extended from the town of Chepſtoll, where it beginneth almoſt by a ſtraight line a lttle aboue Shroweſburye, euen to weſtcheſter, northwarde. Into that parte, ſo many of the Britains as remained alyue after the ſlaughter and loſſe of their countrey, at the lengthe, being dryuen to their ſhyftes, dydde repaire as ancient writynges report: where partely through refuge of the mountains, and partly of the woddes and marſhes, they remained in ſafetie: whiche part
                  •
                they enioye euen to this day. That land afterwardes the englyſhmen dyd call wales: and the Britains the inhabitantes of the ſame walſhmen: for amonges the Germains, walſman, ſignifieth a ſtranger, an alien, an outborn or ſtrange man: that

is, ſuche a one, as hathe a contrary language from theirs (for wall, in their tong▪ is called a ſtranger borne, as an Italian or Frencheman: whiche differ in ſpeche from the Germaine: Man, ſignifieth Homo, whiche is a man in engliſhe. Therfore Engliſhemen, a people of Germanye, after they had wonne Britayne, called the Britains, whiche eſcaped after the deſtruction of their countreye, after their countrey maner, walſhemen: becauſe they had an other tongue or ſpeche, beſides theirs, and the land which they inhabited, wales: which name afterwardes bothe to the people and countrey dyd remayne. By this meanes the Britaines with their kyngdome loſt their name. But they which affirm that name to bee deriued of their Kynge or quene, without doubt be deceyued. The coū
               trey ſoyle towardes the ſea coaſt, and in other places in the valleys and playnes is moſte fertile, whiche yeldeth both to man & beaſte, great plentie of fruite and graſſe: but in other places for the moſt part it is bareyn, and leſſe fruitfull: becauſe it lacketh tillage: for which cauſe, huſbandmen doo lyue hardely, eatynge Oten cakes, and drinkyng mylk myxt with water, and ſowre whay. Ther be many townes and ſtrong caſteis, and .iiii. biſhoprikes, (if the biſhoprike of Hereforde be counted in Englād, as the late writers declat
                  •
               . The firſt

biſhoprike is Meneue, ſo called of Meneua, whiche at this day they call Sainct Dauids: a Citie very ancient, ſituated vppon the ſea coaſt, and boundeth weſtward towarde Irelande. An other is Landaffe, the third Bangor, and the fourth Saint Aſaph. All which be vnder Tharchebiſhop of Cantorbury. The walſhemen haue a language from thengliſhemen, whiche as they ſaye, that fetche their Petigree frome the Troianes, doothe partely ſound of the Troian antiquitie, and partelye of the Greeke. But howe ſo euer it is, the walſhemen do not pronounce their ſpeache ſo pleaſauntly and gentilly as thenglyſhemen doo, becauſe they ſpeake more in the throte: and contrarywyſe, thengliſhemen rightly folowyng the Latines, doo expreſſe their voyce ſomwhat within the lyps, which to the hearers ſemeth pleaſant & ſweete. And thus much of wales, the third part of Britain
            Now foloweth the fourth and laſte part of Britayne, named Cornewall. This part beginneth on that ſyde, which ſtandeth towarde Spayne weſtward: Toward the Eaſt, it is of bredth .iiii. ſcore and ten miles, extending a little beyonde ſaint Germains, whiche is a very famous village, ſituated on the ryghte hand vppon the ſea coaſte, where the greateſt breadth of that countrey is but .xx. myles: for this parcell of lande on the right hand is cō
               paſſed

with the coaſt of the mayn ſea: and on the left hand with that arme of the ſea, which (as before is declared) parteth the land, and runneth vp to Chepſtoll, where the countrey is in fourme of a Horne: For at the fyrſt, it is narowe, and then groweth broader, a little beyonde the ſaid towne of ſaint Germayne, Eaſtward it bordreth vpon England: weſt, ſouth, & North, the mayn ſea is round about it: It is a very bareyn ſoyle, yeldynge fruite more through trauaile of the tyllers and huſbandmen, then through the goodneſſe of the grounde: but there is greate plentie of leade and tynne: in the mynyng and diggyng wherof, doth ſpecially conſyſt the liuynge and ſuſtentation of the inhabitantes. In this onely partt of Britayn, euen to this day continueth the nation of the Britains, which in ye beginnyng brought out of Gallia occupied and in habited that Iland (if credite may be geuen to them, whiche reporte the firſt inhabitantes of Britayn to come out of the Cities of Armerica.) The argumēt & profe wherof is, becauſe the Corniſhemen doo ſpeake that language, which the Britains vſe now in France, whō the Britons doo call Britonantes.
            This thing to be more true, an old ancient Chronicle doth declare, wherin I foūd written, not Cornubia, but Cornugallia, compounded of Cornu, a horne, the forme wherof

that countrey hath, and of Gallia, oute of which countrey thinhabitants came firſt, the maner of which name is not to be miſlyked. Their tongue is farr diſſonant from engliſh, but is muche lyke to the walſhe tongue, becauſe they haue many words cōmune to both tonges: yet this difference there is betweene them, when a Walſhman ſpeaketh, the Cornyſheman rather vnderſtandeth many wordes ſpoken by the Walſhman, then the whole tale he telleth. Whereby it is manyfeſte, that thoſe thre people do vnderſtand one an other, in lyke maner as the Southerne Scots doo perceiue and vnderſtand the Northern. But it is a thyng very rare and meruailous, that in one Iland there ſhould be ſuch varietie of ſpeches. Cornewall or Cornugall is in the Dioceſſe of Excetour, whiche was ones worthy to be counted the fourth part of the Ilād, as wel for the contrarietie of language, as for the firſt inhabitants thereof, as is beforeſaid. Afterwardes, the Normains whiche conſtituted a kyngdom of all thoſe thre partes reckened Cornewall; to be one of the counties or ſhires of the countrey. Thus much of the particular deſcription of Britayne, that the whole body of the realme (by the membres) may be the better knowen to ſome peraduenture that neuer heard the ſame before.
            The forme of the Ilande is triquetra, or

In whiche place, the breadth beginneth: and ſo continuynge frome the ſouth part to the North, it is but narow, The firſt and right corner of whych Ilande eaſtwarde, is in Rent, at Douer and Sandwiche. From whence to Caleys or Boloigne in Fraunce, is the diſtaunce of .xxx. myles, From this Angle whiche is agaynſt France, to the third Angle, whiche is in the Nortte, in Scotlande, the mayne whereof, boundeth vpon Germany, but no land ſeene: and there the Iland is lyke vnto a wedge, euen at the very angle of the land in Scotlād.

Frō this laſt angle to Hampton: (whiche is a towne vpon the ſea coaſt, with a hauen ſo called toward the ſouth, and therfore called Southhampton) betweene the Angles of Kent and Cornewal, they do meſure by a ſtraight lyne, the whole lengthe of the Iland, and doo ſay, that it cont
