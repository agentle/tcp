            A DECLARATION OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE.
         
            For the vſe of thoſe that teach children, and other vnlearned perſons: Compoſed in forme of a Dialogue, betweene the Maiſter and Scholar.
         
         
            CHAP. I. What Chriſtian doctrine is, and what are the principall parts thereof.
            
               SCHOLER.
               
                  SEEING I do vnderſtand, that it is neceſſarie to ſaluation, to know the Chriſtian doctrine, I deſire you to declare vnto mee what this doctrine is.
            
            
               MASTER.
               The Chriſtian doctrine is a briefe

ſumme of all thoſe thinges, which Chriſt our Lord hath taught, to ſhew vs the way of ſaluation.
            
            
               S
               How many be the principal and moſt neceſſary parts of this doctrine
            
            
               M
               Foure, to wit, the Creede, the Pater noſter, the ten Commandements, and the holy Sacraments.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore are there foure, and neither more nor fewer?
            
            
               M
               Becauſe there are three principal vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charitie, and Grace, neceſſarie to ſaluation. And ſo, the Creede is neceſſarie for Faith, becauſe it teacheth vs that which we haue to beleeue; the Pater noſter, is neceſſary for Hope, becauſe it teacheth vs what wee haue to hope; the ten Commandements are neceſſarie for Charitie, becauſe they teach vs what we haue to doe, to pleaſe God; the ſacraments are neceſſarie, becauſe they are the Inſtruments of Grace, by which thoſe

vertues are receiued and conſerued.
            
            
               S
               I would be glad you ſhould giue me ſome ſimilitude, to vnderſtande better, the neceſsitie of theſe foure parts of Chriſtian doctrine.
            
            
               M
               S. Auguſtine giueth vs the ſimilitude of a houſe: for as to make a houſe, it is needfull firſt to place the fundation, then to rayſe the walles, and laſt of all, to couer it with the roofe, and to doe theſe things there are ſome inſtruments neceſſarie: ſo to make in our Soules the building of ſaluation, we haue need of the foundation of Faith; the walles of Hope; the roofe of Charitie; and the inſtruments, which are the moſt holie Sacraments.
            
         
         
            CHAP. 2. The declaration of the vſuall bleſſing with the ſigne of the Croſſe.
            
               S
               BEfore wee come vnto the firſt part of this doctrine, I would be glad you ſhould giue mee ſome

taſte of thoſe things which are to be beleeued, declaring vnto mee in groſſe and in ſumme, the moſt neceſſarie myſteries that are conteined in the Creede.
            
            
               M
               You haue reaſon, and ſo I will doe. You muſt then know that the principall myſteries of our faith are two, and both two are conteyned in the bleſsing that wee vſe to make with the ſigne of the holie Croſſe. The firſt myſterie is the Vnitie and trinitie of God: the ſecond is the Incarnatiō & Paſsion of our Sauiour.
            
            
               S
               What meaneth the Vnitie and Trinitie of God.
            
            
               M
               Theſe are moſt high matters, & by litle and litle are to be declared, in the progreſſe of this doctrine: but for this time it ſhall ſuffice to learne the names, & to vnderſtād ſo much as you may. The Vnitie of God ſignifieth, that beſides all things created, there is one thinge that hath

not had beginning, but hath alwaies been, and euer ſhall bee, and hath made all other thinges, and maintaineth and gouerneth them, and is aboue all, moſt high, moſt noble, moſt glorious, moſt potent, abſolutely Patrone of all thinges: and this is called God, who is one onely, becauſe there can not bee more then one true Diuinitie, that is to ſaye, one onely Nature and Eſſence, infinitely potent, Holie, good, and ſo foorth. Yet notwithſtanding this Diuinitie, is founde in three perſons, which are called the Father, the Sonne, and the Holie Ghoſt, which three perſons are one onely God, becauſe they haue the ſelfe-ſame Diuinity and eſſence. As for example, if three perſons here in earth, called Peter, Paul, & Iohn, ſhould haue one & the ſame ſoul, & one & the ſame bodie, they ſhould be called three perſōs, becauſe one is

Peter, an other Paul, and an other Iohn: and yet they ſhould be one man onely, and not three men, not hauing three bodies, nor three ſoules but one bodie and one ſoule. This is not poſsible amongſt men, becauſe the being of a man is dererminat & limited, and therefore cannot be in many perſons. But the being of God & his diuinitie is infinite. And there fore the ſelfe-ſame being, and the ſelfe-ſame Diuinitie of the Father, may be, and is found in the ſoone, and in the Holie-Ghoſt. There bee then three perſons, becauſe one is the Father, another is the Sonne, and the third is the Holie-Ghoſt. And yet they are one God onely, becauſe they haue the ſame Diuinitie, the ſame being, the ſame power, wiſedome, goodnes, &c.
            
            
               S.
               Tell me now what ſignifyeth the Incarnatiō & Paſsiō of our Sauiour?
            
            
               M
               You are to know that the ſecond

Diuine perſon, the which as wee haue ſaid, is called the Son, beſides his diuine being, which he had before the world was created, yea from all eternitie, tooke the fleſh & ſoule of man, that is to ſay, our whole nature, in the wombe of a moſt pure Virgin, and ſo hee who was before only God, came likewiſe to be Man. And after hee had conuerſed with men thirtie and three yeares, teaching the way of ſaluation, and working many miracles, in the ende hee ſuffered himſelfe to be nayled vpon a Croſſe, and on the ſame dyed to ſatisfie God for the ſinnes of the whole world: and after three daies he roſe from death to life, and after fourtie daies more, aſcended into heauen, as wee ſhall ſhew in the declaration of the Creede: this is the Incarnation and Paſsion of our Sauiour.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore are theſe the principal

myſteries of our Faith?
            
            
               M
               Becauſe in the firſt, is contayned the firſt beginning, and laſt end of man: In the ſecond, the onely and moſt effectuall meanes to know the firſt beginning, and how to attaine vnto the laſt end: & becauſe in beleeuing and confeſsing theſe two myſteries, we manifeſt our ſelues diſtinct from all the falſe Sectes of Gentils, Turkes, Iewes and Hereticks: and laſtly, becauſe without beleeuing and confeſsing theſe two myſteries, no man can be ſaued.
            
            
               S
               How are theſe myſteries conteyned in the ſigne of the Croſſe?
            
            
               M
               We make the ſigne of the Croſſe when we ſay: In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holie Ghoſt, and that in this forme, putting the right hand vnder the forehead, when we ſaye, In the name of the Father: then vnder the breaſt, when we ſay, & of the Sonne: laſtly,

frō the left ſhoulder vnto the right, when we ſay, and of the holy Ghoſt. And withall the word, In the name, doeth ſhew the vnitie of God: becauſe it is ſaid, in the name, and not in the names: & by the word name is alſo vnderſtood the diuine power and authoritie, which is one only in all the three perſons. Theſe words of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holie Ghoſt, doe ſhew vnto vs the Trinitie of perſons: The ſigning in forme of a Croſſe, repreſenteth vnto vs the Paſsion, and conſequently, the Incarnation of the Sonne of God: the paſsing from the left ſhoulder to the right, and not from the right to the left, ſignifyeth that by the Paſsion of our Sauiour, we are transferred from ſinne vnto grace, from tranſitorie things vnto eternall, from death to life.
            
            
               S
               To what purpoſe is this ſigne of the Croſſe made?
            
            
               
               M
               Firſt it is made to ſhew that wee are Chriſtians, to wit, ſouldiers of our chiefe Emperour Chriſt, becauſe this ſigne is, as it were an enſigne or liuerie, which diſtinguiſheth the ſoldiers of Chriſt, from all the enemies of the Holie Church: to wit, Gentils, Iewes Turkes & Heretiks: beſides this ſigne is made to call for Gods helpe, in all our works:: becauſe with this ſigne, the moſt holie Trinitie is called to help by meanes of the paſſion of our Sauiour: and therefore good Chriſtians vſe to make this ſigne, when they ariſe from bed, whē they goe to ſleepe, and in the beginning of all other things, which they haue to do; finally this ſigne is made to arme vs againſt all temptations of the Deuill, becauſe the Diuel is a fraid of this ſigne, and flyeth from it, as malefactors doe, when they ſee the ſigne of the officers of Iuſtice, and often-times by meanes of this

ſigne of the holie Croſſe, a man eſcapeth many dangers, aſwell ſpirituall as temporal, when he maketh it with faith and truſt of Gods mercy, and of the merits of Chriſt our Sauiour.
            
         
         
            CHAP. 3. The declaration of the Creede.
            
               S
               NOwe comming to the firſt part of this doctrine, I deſire to learne the Creede.
            
            
               M
               The Creede contayneth twelue parts, which are called Articles, and they are twelue, according to the number of the twelue Apoſtles who compoſed the ſame, and are theſe.
               
                  
                     
                        1 I Beleeue in God the Father almightie, Creator of heauen and earth.
                     
                        2 And in Ieſus Chriſt, his onely Sonne our Lord.
                     
                        3 Who was conceiued by the holie Ghoſt, borne of the Virgin Mary.
                     
                        4 Suffered vnder Pontious Pilate, was crucifyed, dead, and buried,

deſcended into Hell.
                     
                        5 The third day he roſe again from death.
                     
                        6 Aſcended into heauen: ſi

                        8 I beleeue in the Holie Ghoſt.
                     
                        9 The holie Catholike Church: the Communion of Saints,
                     
                        10 Remiſsion of ſinnes.

                  S
                  May it pleaſe you declare to mee the firſt article word by word. What ſignifyeth, I beleeue?
               
               
                  M
                  It ſignifyeth, I hold for certaine, and for moſt true, all that is contayned in theſe twelue articles: and the reaſon is this, becauſe the ſame God hath taught the holy Apoſtles theſe ſentences, and the holy Apoſtles the Church, and the Church doth

teach them vs: and becauſe it is impoſsible that God ſhould ſaye that which is falſe, I therefore beleeue theſe things more certainely, then thoſe I ſee with mine eyes, and feele with my hands.
               
               
                  S
                  What meaneth: In God?
               
               
                  M
                  It meaneth that we ought to beleeue firmely, that there is a God, albeit we do not ſee him with corporal eies, & this God is one only, & therefore it is ſaid, in God, and not in Gods. And you muſt not imagine that god is like to any corporal thing how great or faire ſo euer it be, but you muſt thinke, that God is a ſpiritual thing, which euer was, & foreuer ſhalbe, hath made the whole, filleth the whole, gouerneth the whole, knoweth & ſeeth euery thing, & finally, what thing ſoeuer is repreſented vnto our eies, or vnto our imagination, you muſt ſay, that this which now is repreſēted vnto me, is not god

becauſe God is a thinge infinitelie better
               
               
                  S
                  Wherefore is it ſaid that God is a Father?
               
               
                  M
                  Becauſe he is truly the Father of his onlie begotten Son, of whom we ſhal ſpeake in the ſecond article; and alſo becauſe he is the Father of al good men, not by nature but by adoption: and finally becauſe he is the father of al creatures, not by nature, or by adoption, but by creation: as we ſhal ſay hereafter in this ſame article.
               
               
                  S
                  Wherefore is he called Almighty!
               
               
                  M
                  Becauſe it is a proper title of God, and albeit God hath manie proper titles, as eternal, infinite, vnmeaſurable and others, yet in this place the moſt fit is, that he is omnipotent, becauſe it may not ſeeme hard vnto vs to beleeue, that hee hath made heauen and earth of nothing, as in the words following is

added. For that vnto him, who can do al that he wil, & thereby is omnipotent, nothing can be hard. And if you ſhould ſay vnto me, God can not dye, nor ſinne, and therefore it ſemeth not that he can do al things, I would anſwere you, that to dye or to ſinne is not power but impotencie, as when it is ſaid of a moſt valiant ſoldier, that hee can ouercome al, and that he cannot be ouercome of anie, it doth not preindicate his force to ſay, that he cannot be ouercome, becauſe that he can be ouercome, is not ſtrēgth but weaknes
               
               
                  S
                  What is ſignified by Creator?
               
               
                  M
                  It ſignifieth that God hath made al thinges of nothing, and he alone can bring them againe vnto nothing. The Angels, Men and alſo Diuels can make, and vnmake ſome things, but they can not make them otherwiſe, then of ſome kinde of matter which was before, neither

can they vnmake thē but by changing them into ſome other thing, as a Maiſon cannot make a houſe of nothing, but he muſt haue ſtones, lyme and wood: neither can he deſtroy it in bringing it to nothing, but into ſtones, duſt, wood, and ſuch like: ſo that God only is called & is a creator, becauſe he only hath no need of any matter to make all things.
               
               
                  S
                  Why is he called creator of heauē and earth: hath not God alſo made the ayre, the water, ſtones, trees, men and all other things?
               
               
                  M
                  By heauen and earth, is alſo vnderſtood, all that is in heauen and earth, as he that ſaith: a man hath a bodie & a ſoule, meaneth alſo that he hath al things belonging to a bodie, as veines, bloud, bones, ſinewes and the reſt: & all things belonging vnto a ſoule; as vnderſtanding, will, memorie, internal and external ſenſes, and the reſt: ſo that by heauen is

vnderſtood the ayre where birds vſe to be & all things aboue, where the clouds & the ſtars are: wherevpon it is ſaid, the birds of heauē, the clouds of heauen, the ſtars of heauen, & finally the Angels. By the earth is vnderſtood al that is compaſſed by the aire, as the waters of the ſea, & of the riuers, which are in the lower partes of the earth, & alſo al liue creatures, plants, ſtones, mettals, and all other things which are found in the earth, or in the ſea: it is therefore ſaid, that God is creator of heauen & earth, becauſe theſe two are the principall parts of the world, the one aboue, in the which the Angels remaine, and the other beneath, in which men do dwel, which are the two moſt noble creatures of all others, the which alſo all others do ſerue, as they are alſo bound to ſerue God who hath made them of nothing, and placed them in ſo high eſtate.
               
            
            
               
               The declaration of the ſecond Article.
               
                  S
                  DEclare vnto me now the ſecond article; what ſignifyeth: And in Ieſus Chriſt his onely Sonne our Lord?
               
               
                  M
                  The ſame God omnipotent, of whom wee haue ſpoken in the firſt article, hath one true and naturall Sonne, who is called Ieſus Chriſt, & that you may ſee in ſome ſort howe God hath begotten this Sonne; take the example of a looking-glaſſe, whē one doth looke in a glaſſe, preſently he produceth an Image of himſelfe, ſo like as no difference can be found in ſo much as it is not onely like in ſhape, but in moouing alſo: for that if the man mooue, the Image wil alſo mooue, and this Image being ſo like, is not made by any labour, neither is it long in making, nor with inſtruments, but in a moment, and with one looke onely. In like manner, you haue

to thinke, that God beholding him ſelfe, with the eye of vnderſtanding, in the glaſſe of his Diuinitie, doth produce an Image moſt like vnto him ſelfe. And becauſe God hath geuen vnto this Image al his owne ſubſtance & his owne being (which wee can not do in beholding our ſelues in a glaſſe) therefore that Image is the true Sonne of God, albeit our Images which wee ſee in glaſſes are not our ſonnes. Hereof you muſt gather, that the Sonne of God is God, as the Father, and one the ſame God with the father, ſeeing he hath the ſame ſubſtance that his Father hath: furthermore, you haue together that the Son of God is not yonger then his Father, but was alwaies as his father alwaies was becauſe he was begotten by Gods only beholding himſelfe, and God hath alwaies beholden him-ſelfe. Laſtly, you haue togeather, that the

Sonne of God was not begotten, with help of a woman, nor in length of time, nor in delight of concupiſcence, nor any other imperfection, becauſe, as it hath bin ſaid, hee was begotten of the Father alone, by the only beholding himſelfe, with the moſt pure eye of his diuine vnderſtanding.
               
               
                  S
                  What doth it meane that this Son of God is called Ieſus Chriſt?
               
               
                  M
                  This name of Ieſus ſignifyeth a Sauiour, & Chriſt, which is his ſurname, ſignifyeth high Prieſt and king of all kings, becauſe, as I haue told you, in declaring the ſigne of the Croſſe, the Son of God became man, to redeeme vs againe with his blood, & to bring vs to eternall ſaluation. And ſo when hee became man, he tooke this name Sauiour, to ſhew that he was come to ſaue vs, & he was honoured by his Father, with the title of Higheſt Prieſt, and Supreame

King, for that Chriſt doeth ſignifye all this, and hereof wee are called Chriſtians.
               
               
                  S
                  What is the reaſon that all men take off their caps, or bowe downe when Ieſus is named, which is not done to other names of God?

Therefore we for gratitude bow our ſelues vnto him, and not onely wee men, but the Angels of heauen alſo, and the diuels of hell, doe bow to this name, the one for loue, and the other by force: for that God will, that all reaſonable creatures do bowe vnto his ſonne: ſeeing that he hath abaſed himſelfe, for our loue to the death of the Croſſe.

                  In this Article is declared the new and merueilous maner of the Incarnation of the Sonne of God. You know, that all other men are borne of father and mother, & that the mother remaineth not a Virgin, after the conceiuing and bringing foorth of a childe. But the Sonne of God intending to make him ſelfe Man, would haue no Father in earth

but a Mother onely: to wit, the perpetuall and moſt pure Virgin Marie, in whoſe wombe the Holie Ghoſt (the third perſon in Trinitie, one and the ſelfe-ſame God with the Father and the Sonne) by his infinite power, formed of her moſte pure blood, the bodie of a moſt perfect childe: & at the ſame time created a moſt noble ſoule, ioyning it to the ſame bodie: all which the Sonne of God vnited to his owne Perſon. And ſo Ieſus Chriſt that before was onely God, became man, who as hee is God, hath a Father without a Mother, and as he is Man, hath a Mother without a Father.

                  The ſecrets of God muſt be beleeued, although they be not vnderſtood, becauſe God can do more thē we can eaſely vnderſtand, & therefore

it is ſaid in the beginning of the Creed, that God is omnipotent. Yet there is a fit example in the creation of the world. You know that ordinarily the ground doth not bring forth corne vnleſſe it be plowed, ſowne, watred with raine, & warmed with the ſunne, and yet in the beginning, when corne was firſt brought forth, the earth being neither tilled nor fowne, watred, nor warmed (and ſo was a virgin in her kinde) ſuddenly, by the only commandement of God almighty, & by his powre it brought foorth corne: euen ſo the vnſpotted wombe of the B. Virgin MARIE, without companie of man, at the only commandement of God, by the worke of the Holy Ghoſt, brought foorth that precious corne, of the liuing bodie, of the Sonne of God.

                  It is not ſo; becauſe to be a Father, it is not ſufficiēt to make a thing but it is neceſſarie, that it be made of the ſubſtance of the maker: and therefore we ſay that the Maiſon is not the father of the houſe, becauſe he maketh it of ſtones, and not of his proper ſubſtance. So the holie ghoſt hath made the bodie of the Sonne of God, but he hath made it of the blood of the virgin, & not of his own proper ſubſtance: and therefore the Son of God, is not the Sonne of the Holie Ghoſt, but the Sonne of God the Father, as he is God, becauſe hee hath his Godhead of him: and he is the Son of the B. virgin as he is man, for that he hath mans fleſh of her.

Tell me then, if Chriſt be the Sonne of God omnipotent, how happened it, that he was not deliuered by his Father, out of the handes of Pilate? Or rather, if the ſame Chriſt be God, wherefore did hee

not deliuer himſelfe?

                  Chriſt could if hee would haue deliuered himſelfe by a thouſande meanes out of the handes of Pilate. Yea more, the whole world had not bin able to do him any euil, if he had not bin willing: and this is clearely ſeene, becauſe he knew & foretolde vnto his Diſciples, that the Iewes would ſeeke to put him to death, & that they would whippe him, ſtone him, and finallie kill him. Yet he did not hide himſelfe but went to meete his enemies. And when they ſought to take him, and knew him not, hee ſaid vnto them himſelfe, hee was that man for whom they ſought: at which time alſo, they al faling backwards as dead mē, he did not depart thence as he might haue done, but expected & permitted them to recouer thēſelues: & after, he ſuffred him ſelfe to be taken, bound, & led like a meeke Lambe, where they would.

                  For manie reaſons. But the principal reaſon was, to ſatiſfie vnto God for our ſinnes. For you haue to know that the offence is meaſured according to the dignitie of him who is offended: and contrariewiſe the ſatisfaction is meaſured according to the dignitie of him who doth ſatisfie: as for example, if a ſeruant ſhould geue his Prince a blow, it ſhould be eſteemed a moſt greeuous offence, according to the greatnes of the prince: but if a prince ſhould giue his ſeruant a blowe, it were a ſmal matter, according to the baſe eſtate of the ſeruant. And contrariwiſe, if a ſeruant take off his cappe vnto his Prince, it is but little eſteemed, but if the Prince ſhould take off his, vnto his ſeruant it would be a notable fauour, according to

the rule we ſpeake of. Now becauſe the firſt man, and with him al we haue offended God, who is of ſo infinite dignitie, the offence did require infinite ſatisfaction: and becauſe there was neither man nor Angel of ſo great dignitie, therefore the Sonne of God came, who being God and of infinite dignitie, & hauing taken mortal fleſh, in the ſame fleſh he ſubmitted him ſelfe for the honour of God to the death of the Croſſe, and ſo ſatisfied with his paines for our faults.

                  To teach vs by his example, the vertues, of Patience, Humilitie, Obedience and of Charitie: which are foure vertues ſignified in the foure extreame parts of the Croſſe: becauſe greater patience can not be found, then to ſuffer vniuſtly ſo

ignominious a death: nor greater humilitie, then for the Lord of all Lordes, to ſubmit him ſelfe to be crucified betwixt thieues: nor greater obedience, then to be willing rather to die, then not to fulfil the commandement of his Father: nor greater charitie, then to yeeld his life, to ſaue his enimies. And you muſt know, that Charitie is more ſhewed in deedes, then in wordes, & more in ſuffering then in doing. And ſo Chriſt, who would not only beſtow vpon vs infinit benifits, but ſuffer alſo, & die for vs, hath ſhewed that he loueth vs moſt ardently.

But in this depth of the earth, there are foure, as it were, great caues: one for the damned, which is the deepeſt of al, and ſo it is agreable, that the proud Diuels, and the men which imitate them, be in the loweſt place, and furtheſt from heauen that can be. In the ſecond caue, which is ſomething higher, are thoſe ſoules, which ſuffer the paines of Purgatorie. In the third, which is yet higher, are the ſoules of thoſe children, that die with out Baptiſme, who do not ſuffer torments of fire, but onely the

perpetuall priuation of eternall felicity. In the fourth, which is the higheſt, remained the ſoules of the Patriarchs, Prophets, and other Holie men, that dyed before the comming of Chriſt; for albeit, thoſe holy ſoules had not any thing to be purged, yet they could not enter into glory, before Chriſt by his death had opened the gate of eternall life: & therefore they remained in that higher place, called, the place of holy Fathers, otherwiſe Abrahams boſome, where they ſuffered no paines at all, but enjoyed a ſweete repoſe, expecting the comming of our Lord with great joy. And ſo we read in the Goſpel, that the ſoule of that poore beggar Lazarus, was carried by an Angell to reſt in the boſome of Abraham, where hee was ſeene by the rich glutton, who burning in flames of hell, caſt vp his eyes, and ſaw Lazarus in a farre higher place, remayning

in great joy and conſolation, enjoying the fruits of his former patience.

And he that beleeueth it, hath no difficultie to beleeue the reſt. For he that riſeth, was certainly dead before: And he that was dead, was firſt borne: And ſo he that beleueth the Reſurrection of Chriſt, findeth no labour in beleeuing his death, and natiuitie. And likewiſe, for ſo much as the earth is not a conuenient place for glorious bodies, but heauen, therefore he that beleueth the Reſurrection of our Sauiour, can eaſely beleeue his going vp into heauen.

                  I would know the cauſe, wherefore it is ſaid, that Chriſt went vp into heauen, and of his moſt holie Mother it is ſaid, that ſhe was aſſumpted, or taken vp into heauen, & not that ſhe aſcended, or went vp?
               
               
                  
                  M
                  The reaſon is eaſie. For that Chriſt being God and man, went vp into heauen, by his owne powre, as he alſo roſe by his owne powre. But his Mother, who is a meere creature though moſt worthie amongſt all others, was rayſed from death, and aſſumpted vnto the kingdome of heauen, not by her owne power, but by the power of God.
               
               
                  S
                  What meaneth. He ſitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almightie?
               
               
                  M
                  You muſt not imagine, that the Father is on the left-hande of the Sonne: nor that the Father is in middeſt, hauing his Sonne on the righthand, and the Holie-Ghoſt on the left corporally. For as well the Father as the Sonne, according to his God-head, and the Holie Ghoſt, are euery where. Neither can it be properly ſaid, that one is on the righthand of an other: but to bee at the

right hand in this article, ſignifieth to be in equal height, glorie, and maieſtie: becauſe when one is ſide by ſide of an other, one is not higher, nor lower then the other. And to vnderſtand this maner of ſpeach, the holie Scripture in the Pſalme 109. which beginneth: Dixit Dominus Domino meo: &c. doth once ſaye, that the Sonne doeth ſitte at the right hand of the Father: and an other time ſaith, that the Father is at the right hand of the Sonne: inſtructing vs, that they are in deed in equal height: as we haue ſaid. So that Chriſt, when he went vp into heauen, aſcended aboue all the Quyars and orders of the Angels, & of the bleſſed ſoules. which he caried with him, & ariued vnto the high throne of God, and there ſtayed, not going aboue his Father, neither remayning vnder him, but reſting (as we may ſay) ſide by his father, as

equal with him in glory & greatnes
               
               
                  S
                  Seeing Chriſt is God and man, I would know, if he ſit at the right hand of the Father, as he is God onlie, or as he is alſo man?
               
               
                  M
                  Chriſt as he is God, is equal to the Father, as he is man, he is leſſe then the Father: yet for ſo much, as Chriſt God and man, are not two Chriſtes, nor two perſons, but one Chriſt onelie, and one perſon onlie: therefore it is ſaide, that Chriſt God and man, ſitteth at the right hand of the Father. And ſo the humanitie of our Lord, to wit, his fleſh and ſoule, 
                        •
                     re in the throne of God, on the right hand of God the father. Not by their proper worthines, but becauſe they are vnited to the perſon, of the true and natural Son of God.
               
               
                  S

                  Take the ſimilitude of a kings robe: whē the king being veſted with

his purple robe, ſitteth in his royal throne, & al the Princes of his kingdome ſit below him, the kings robe is in a more eminent place, then the Nobles them ſelues are, becauſe it is in the ſelfe ſame throne with the King. And this is done not becauſe the robe is of equal dignitie with the king, but becauſe it is ioyned to the King, as his proper garment. So the fleſh and the ſoule of Chriſt do ſitte aboue al the Cherubims, and Seraphims, in the ſame ſeat with God: not by the dignitie of their owne nature, but becauſe they are vnited vnto God: not onely as the garment is vnto the king, but in much nearer ſorte, to wit, by perſonal vnion. As hath bene ſaid.

And there ſhal be no more dayes, nor nights, nor Mariages, nor marchandiſe, or anie of theſe things, which you now ſee. So that, in the laſt day of this world, which no man can know, how neere it is, nor how long hence, Chriſt wil come downe from heauen, to make the general Iudgment. And theſe words, From thence he ſhal come, do forewarne vs, not to beleeue anie that ſhal cal him ſelfe Chriſt, or that would deceiue vs, as Antichriſt wil endeuour to do, towards the end of the world. For that the true Chriſt, wil not come forth of anie deſert, or obſcure place, but wil come from the higheſt heauen, with ſo much glorie, and maieſtie, as no man can

doubt, whether it be he or no. Like as when the Sun riſeth, it commeth with ſo much light, as no man can doubt whether lt be the Sun or no.

                  By the quick and the dead, may be vnderſtood, the good which liue with the ſpirituall life of grace, and the bad which are ſpiritually dead by ſin. But it is true alſo, that Chriſt will come to iudge the quicke and the dead corporally: becauſe at that day many ſhal be dead, and manie ſhall be found aliue: Who though they be liuing in that laſt daye, and ſome alſo ſhall bee young, or children, yet all ſhall die in an inſtant, and ſuddenly riſe againe, thereby to pay the debt of death.

                  I haue heard many times, that whoſoeuer dyeth in mortall ſinne,

goeth preſently vnto hell, and whoſoeuer dyeth in the grace of God, goeth preſently to Purgatorie, or to heauen: how then are all to be judged, the ſentence being already giuē?

                  At the death of euery one, the particular judgement is giuen of that ſoule which departed from the bodie: but after, at the laſt day, there ſhall be an vniuerſall judgement of the whole world. And this for manny cauſes. Firſt, for Gods honour, becauſe manie nowe ſeeing bad-men in proſperitie, and good-men afflicted: imagine that God doeth not gouerne the world well. But at that time, it ſhall be cleerly ſeen, how God hath ſeene & noted all things, and how with great juſtice, he hath giuen vnto the bad, ſome temporall proſperitie, in recompence of ſome good works of theirs, of ſmal momēt, intending afterwards, to giue them eternall paine, for their mortall ſins.

And contrariwiſe vnto the good, he hath geuen temporal affliction, for puniſhmēt of ſome veniall ſinnes, or to geue them occaſion, & to make them do penance, intending afterwards, to reward them, with an infinite treaſure of glorie, for their good workes. Secondly, for the glorie of Chriſt, becauſe he being vniuſtly condemned, and by manie not knowne, nor honored as he ought to be, it is reaſon there ſhould be a day, when al the world ſhal know him, & honour him, either by force, or for loue, as their true king & Lord of al. Thirdly, for the glorie of the Saincts? to the end it may be ſeene vnto all how God hath glorified them, who were perſecuted, & vexed in this world. Fourthly, for confuſion of the proud enimies of God. Fiftly, becauſe the bodie ſhal haue ſentēce together with the ſoule of glorie or of puniſhment eternal.

                  Here is declared the third Perſon of the moſt Holie Trinitie, as in the firſt article was declared, the firſt, and in the other ſixe the ſecond: ſo that the Holie Ghoſt is not the Father, nor the Sonne, but a third Perſon, which procedeth from the Father and the Sonne, and is true God as the Father, and the Sonne, yea the ſame God, becauſe he hath the ſame diuinitie, which is in the Father, and in the Sonne.

                  Diuine matters, can not be perfectly declared, by any examples of created things, & eſpecially by corparal things. Notwithſtanding take you the example of a lake, which is deriued from ſome riuer? as the

riuer is deriued from ſome fountaine, and yet al is one, and the ſame water: ſo the eternal Father, as a fountaine, produceth the Sonne as a riuer: the Father and the Sonne, as a fountaine and a riuer, produce the Holie Ghoſt as a lake: & yet the Father, and the Sonne, and the Holie Ghoſt are not three Gods, but one onlie God.
               
               
                  S
                  Wherefore is the third Perſon in Trinitie called holie ghoſt? Are not alſo al Angels, and al the bleſſed ſoules, ſpirits and holie?
               
               
                  M
                  God is called the Holie ſpirit by excelencie, becauſe he is the chiefeſt ſpirite, and moſt holie and author of al created ſpirites, and of al holines. Like as a mongſt mē, ther are manie that are fathers and holie, either by office, or by goodnes of life, to wit, manie good Biſhops, or Prieſts, or religious men: and yet there is none called Holie Father, but the Pope:

becauſe this name belongeth vnto him alone by excellencie, being the head of al other fathers, and ought to be the moſt holie of al by goodnes of life, as he is by office, repreſenting vnto vs the perſon of Chriſt.
               
               
                  S
                  If the name of holie ghoſt, belong vnto God by excellencie, wherefore is it onely attributed vnto the third Perſon. Is not the father alſo, & the Sonne a ſpirit & holy by excellēcie?
               
               
                  M
                  It is true. But becauſe the firſt Perſon hath a proper name, to wit, the Father: & the ſecond hath a proper name, to wit, the Son: to the third is left a commō name, to diſtinguiſh him from the other two. And moreouer you are to know, that when it is ſaid of the third diuine Perſon, that he is the holy ghoſt; theſe two words make one name only. As whē a man is called Ioannes Maria, they are one onely name, though otherwiſe Iohn & Mary are commonly two names.

                  M
                  You muſt not thinke that the Holy Ghoſt hath a bodie, or that he can be ſeene with corporall eyes: but he is painted ſo, that we may knowe the effects, which he worketh vpon men. And becauſe the Doue is ſimple, pure, jealouſe, and fruitfull, he is therefore painted ouer Chriſt and our Ladie, to the ende we may vnderſtand, that Chriſt and our Ladie were full of grace, and of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and in particular of holy ſimplicitie, puritie, zeale of ſoules, and ſpirituall fecunditie, by the which they haue gained infinite children, to wit, all the faithfull, and good Chriſtians.

And in ſigne of theſe wonderfull effects, he cauſed thoſe tongues of fire to appeare: becauſe the light of that fire, doth ſignifie wiſdome, the heate of the ſame, doth ſignifie charitie, and the forme of a tongue ſignifyeth eloquence: and for that this was a moſt great benefite, which God beſtowed vpon his Church, therefore we doe celebrate that great Feaſt, called Penticoſt, or the Feaſt of the Holie Ghoſt.

And as in God we beleeue one Diuinity, and three Perſons: ſo in the Church wee beleeue that there is one onely Church: and that it hath three principall graces: the firſt in the ſoule, which is the remiſsion of ſinnes, an other in the bodie, which ſhal be the reſurrection of the fleſh: and the third in the ſoule and bodie together, which ſhall be life eternall, as we ſhall ſee in the articles following.

                  It ſignifyeth a conuocation, or congregation of men, which are baptized, and make profeſsion of the faith, and law of Chriſt, vnder the obedience, of the chiefe Biſhop

of Rome: and it is called Conuocation, becauſe wee are not borne Chriſtians, as we are borne Engliſhmen, Italians, French, or of any other countrey: but wee are called Chriſtians of Chriſt, and wee enter into this congregation by baptiſme, which is as the doore of the church. And to be in the Church, it doeth not ſuffice to bee baptized, but it is needeful to beleeue and confeſſe the holie faith and law of Chriſt, as the Paſtors and Preachers of the ſame Church do teach vs. Neither doth this ſuffice, but it is neceſſarie to obey the chiefe Biſhop of Rome, as Vicar of Chriſt, to wit, to acknowledge and hold him for chiefe Superiour and Vicar of Chriſt.

                  Becauſe the faithfull, which are

the true Church, are gathered together in thoſe buildings, to practiſe the exerciſes of Chriſtians, therefore thoſe buildings are alſo called Churches: chiefly when they are dedicated, and conſecrated to the ſeruice of God. But we in this Article, doe not ſpeake of the Churches made of ſtone & wood, but of the liuing Church, which is, the faithful baptiſed people, and obedient vnto the vicar of Chriſt, as hath been ſaid.

And therefore it is not only called one but alſo Catholike, that is to ſay vniuerſal, becauſe it is extended to all places, and to all times.

                  It is called one onelie, becauſe it hath one onlie head, which is Chriſt, and his one Vicar in earth the Biſhop of Rome? and againe, becauſe it liueth by one and the ſame ſpirit, and hath one and the ſame law. As a kingdome is called one, becauſe it hath one onlie king, and the ſame lawes, though in that kingdome, there be manie prouinces, & manie more Cities or townes.

                  M
                  It is called holie for three reaſons: firſt, becauſe the head there of, which is Chriſt, is moſt holie: like as

one that hath a fayre faice, is ſaid to be a faire man, though he haue ſome crooked finger, or ſome blot on his breaſt or ſhoulders. Secondly, becauſe all faithfull people are holy, by faith and profeſsion, for they haue one moſte true and diuine faith, and make profeſsion of the holie Sacraments, and of a moſt iuſte law, which doth not command any thing, but that which is good, and forbiddeth nothing, but that which is euill. Thirdly, becauſe there are alwaies in the Church ſome aſſuredly good, not onely by faith and profeſſion, but by vertues and maners alſo: Whereas among Iewes, Turkes, Heretiks and ſuch like people, who are out of the Church, none at all can truely be good.

                  It ſignifyeth, that the body of the holie Church, is in ſuch ſort vnited,

that of the good of one member all the reſt doe participate: whereby how many ſoeuer there bee in farre countries, though we do not knowe them, yet their Maſſes, diuine offices, other prayers and good workes helpe vs alſo. And this Communion is not onely heere vpon earth, but our Maſſes, prayers and other good workes, helpe thoſe that be in Purgatorie: And the prayers of ſuch, as are in heauen helpe vs, & the ſoules alſo in Purgatorie.

                  It is not ſo: Becauſe Maſſe, praiers, and other good workes, though they be in ſome ſort cōmon vnto al, yet they help more ſuch as they are done for in particular, then others.

                  M
                  For this they are called excommunicated, becauſe they haue not the communion of the Saints, for they are like bowes cut from the tree, or like members ſeparated from the bodie, which do not enjoy the good humors, that are ſpread amongſt the other bowes, and vnited members. And by this you may gather, what account is to be made of excommunication, ſeeing he cannot haue God for his Father, that hath not the Church for his Mother.

                  Are then the excommunicated out of the Church, as the Iewes, and other Infidels be?
               
               
                  M
                  So it is: but there is this difference, that the Iewes and Turkes are out of the Church, becauſe they neuer entred in, being neuer baptiſed; the Heretikes, which are baptiſed,

and haue loſt their faith are out, becauſe they are gone foorth, and fled away of themſelues, and therefore the Church enforceth them by diuers puniſhments, to returne vnto the Holy faith: As when a ſheepe flyeth from the fold, the ſhepheard forceth him with his ſtafe to returne. But other excommunicated which haue baptiſme and faith, and did enter in, and not goe out of themſelues, are driuen out by force. As when the ſhepheard driueth foorth an infected ſheepe, and leaueth the ſame a pray for the Wolfe. Yet true it is, that the Church driueth not out the excommunicated, to the end they ſhould euer remaine out, but to the end they ſhould repent of their diſobedience, and demaund to returne being humbled, and ſo bee receiued againe into the boſome of their mother, and to the communion of Saints.

                  This is the firſt of thoſe three principal benefites, which are found in the Church. For which it is needful to know, that al men are borne ſinners, and enimies to God, and after increaſing, they paſſe from euil to worſe, vntil by the grace of God, their ſinnes be remitted, and ſo become his friends, and children. This grace which is ſo great, is not found other where, thē in the holie church. In which are the holie Sacramēts, & namely Baptiſme, & Penance, which as heauenlie medicins curemen of al ſpiritual diſeaſes, which are ſinnes.
               
               
                  S
                  I pray you declare vnto me, a little better, how great this benifite is, of remiſſion of ſinnes?
               
               
                  M
                  In the world is not found, a greater euil then ſinne is: not onely for

that al euills in this life, and in the life to come, do ſpring from it; but alſo, for that ſinne is the cauſe, that man becommeth an enemie to God. And what can be ſaid worſe, then to be enimie vnto him, who can do al that he wil, and none can reſiſt him: & who can defend him, with whom God is angrie? And contrariwiſe, in this life a greater good can not be found, then to be in grace: for who can hurt him, whom God defendeth al things being in the hands of God? Briefly you know, that amongſt corporal thinges life is moſt eſteemed, becauſe it is the foundation of al other good things: and death is moſt abhorred becauſe it is contrarie vnto life. So then ſeeing ſin is the ſpiritual death of the ſoule, and the remiſſion of ſin, is the life of the ſame ſoule: you may eaſely conſider, how great a benefit is receiued, in the church ſeeing in it only, is the remiſſion of ſins.

And againe, the reſurrection is to the end, that the bodie be partaker of the reward, or puniſhment, as it hath ben partaker of good workes or the ſinnes: & there muſt be the ſame bodie, becauſe an other bodie ſhould not merit either puniſhment or reward.

                  Yes, for God can doe that which ſeemeth to vs impoſsible. And there fore it is ſaid, in the beginning of the Creede, that God is omnipotent.

And if you conſider that God hath made the heauen and the earth of nothing, it will not ſeeme hard vnto you to beleeue, that he can bring againe to the former ſtate that which is turned into aſhes.

                  It is neceſſarie to beleeue, that the men ſhall be men, & the wemen ſhall be wemen: becauſe otherwiſe they ſhould not be the ſame bodies, that they were before, and as I haue already told you, they are to be the ſame, albeit in the life to come, there ſhal not be any more bringing forth of children, nor husbands, nor wiues yet there ſhall be diuerſitie of men and wemen, to the ende, that euerie one enjoy the reward of their proper vertues, which they haue exerciſed in their owne ſexe, and as it ſhall be a goodly ſight to behold the glorie

of Martyrs, & of Confeſſors, ſo ſhall it be to behold the glorie of the virgins, and aboue all, the Mother of our Lord.

                  Al ſhal riſe in that ſtature, and in that ſtate which they had or were to haue, at the age of thirty three years, in the which our Lorde roſe. So that the children ſhal riſe ſo great as they ſhould haue bene, if they had arriued vnto thirtie three yeares: and the olde men ſhall riſe in that flowre of age which they had, when they were thirtie and three yeares olde. And if any in this life, haue bene Blinde, Crooked, a Dwarfe, or had anie other deformitie, hee ſhall ryſe whole, ſonnde, and with all perfection. Becauſe the workes of GOD are perfecte. And ſo

in the reſurrection, which ſhalbe his proper worke, he wil correct the errors, and defectes of nature.

                  M
                  I wil teach you this myſterie, by a ſimilitude of the thinges in this world. You know that here in earth, we deſier a bodie, that is ſound, comelie, nimble, and ſtrong: a ſoule that is wiſe, prudent, and learned, touching the vnderſtanding, & ful of al vertues touching the wil: & beſides theſe; we deſire exterior goods

to wit, riches, honors, powre, and pleaſures. Euen ſo is eternal life, the bodie for health ſhal haue immortalitie, with impaſibilitie, that is to ſay, that nothing can harme it: for beautie it ſhal haue clearnes, to wit, it ſhal ſhine, as the ſun: for nimblenes it ſhal haue agilitie, that in one moment, it ſhal be able to moue from one ſide of the worlde to the other, and from the earth to heauen, without anie labour: for ſtrength it ſhal haue ſuch force, that without eating, drinking, ſleeping, or other reſt, it ſhal be able to ſerue the ſpirit, in al things that ſhal be neceſſarie, neither ſhal it haue feare of anie thing. Touching the ſoule, the vnderſtanding ſhal be ful of knowledge, for it ſhall behold the cauſe of al things, which is God. The wil ſhalbe ful of ſo much goodnes, and charitie, that it can not commit anie venial ſinne. The riches ſhal be to want nothing, hauing

all things in God. Their honour, to be the children of God, equall to Angels, for they ſhall be kings, and ſpirituall Prieſts for euer: their power agreeable; for together with God, they ſhall bee Lordes of the whole world, & be able to do all that they ſhall haue will to doe: for that they ſhall alwaies be conformable to the will of God, which nothing can reſiſt. Finally, their delight ſhal be vnſpeakeable, becauſe all their powers, aſwel of the ſoule as of the body, ſhal be joyned vnto their proper objects. Whereof will ariſe a full contentment, a moſt perfect peace neuer proued before, a perpetuall gladnes, joy, and exultation.

                  If euery one ſhall haue all theſe things, & euery one ſhalbe cōtented in one maner, then ſhall not one be more bleſſed in heauē then an other
               
               
                  M
                  Yes aſſuredly: For he who hath merited more in this life, ſhall haue

greater reward, & ſhalbe more happie: yet for al that, there ſhalbe no enuie, nor any diſcontentment: becauſe each one ſhalbe filled, according to their capacitie: & thoſe which haue merited more, ſhalbe more capable, & ſo ſhall haue more glorie. As for example: If a Father hauing manie children, one greater then another, according to their age, ſhould make to euery one of them, a garment of cloth of gold, proportionable vnto euery ones ſtature, there is no doubt but that the greateſt ſhould haue the bigeſt garment, & of greateſt valew & yet euery one would remaine cō
                     tented: neither would hee that were leſſe, deſire the garment of him that were greater, becauſe it would no be ſo fit for him.

                  What is the cauſe of this beatitude of heauē is called life euerlaſting: ſhal not the damned liue for euer in hel?
               
               
                  M
                  Life properly is ſaide to bee in other

thoſe things which mooue of themſelues. Whereupon in a certain maner, the water of a fountaine is called Liue-water, becauſe it mooueth: and water of Pooles, is called dead, becauſe it ſtandeth ſtill. So the bleſſed in heauē, are ſaid to haue eternal life, for that they can worke all that they wil, with all their inwarde, and outwarde powers, without any impediment. And they doe alwaies worke and exerciſe themſelues as they moſt deſire. But the damned in hell, notwithſtanding they liue (for they ſhall neuer bee conſumed) yet they are ſaid to haue eternall death, becauſe they are ſtill tyed vnto the fire and torments, and are enforced euer to ſuffer that which they would not: neither can they do anie thing, that they would. So that the bleſſed in heauen enjoy all good, without any mixture of euil: and the damned in hell, do ſuffer all euill, not being

able to fulfil any of their deſires.

            CHAP. IIII. The declaration of our Lords prayer.
            
               S
               I haue learned through the grace of God, that I am to beleeue: I deſire that you now teach me what I am to hope for, & deſire; & what meanes I may haue to obtaine it.
            
            
               M
               Al that you demaund is conteyned in our Lords prayer, which wee call the Pater noſter: For in this praier is declared what thing is to be deſired, & of whom we are to demand it, and the ſelfe-ſame prayer is the meanes to obtaine it.
            
            
               S
               Which is our Lords prayer?
            
            
               M
               It is this, Our father which art in heauen, &c.
            
            
               S
               For what cauſe do you prefer the

                  Pater noſter, before all other praiers?
            
            
               M
               Firſt, becauſe it is the moſt excellent of all, being made by Chriſt himſelfe, who is the ſupreame wiſdome. Secondly, becauſe this praier is ſhorteſt, and ſo is eaſie to be learned and kept in memorie, & with al ful of ſubſtance, conteyning all that we ought to demand of God: thirdly, becauſe it is moſt profitable, and effectual, being made by him who is both our Iudge & our Aduocate, & therefore knoweth better then any other, how we ought to demaunde, that we may obtaine. Fourthlie it is the moſt neceſſarie of all others, in regard that all Chriſtians are bound to know it, & to repeate it euery day, and therefore it is called the dailie praier, that is to ſay, prayer to be ſaid euery day.
            
            
               S
               Declare then (I pray you) thoſe wordes: Our Father which art in heauen.
            
            
               
               M
               Theſe few words are, as it were a litle preface, or a preparation to the praier. For in ſaying that God is our Father, we take corage & confidèce, to pray vnto him: in ſaying hee is in heauē, we remember our ſelues, that we ought to go vnto him with great feare & humilitie, ſeeing he is notan earthly father, but an heauēly: again, ſaying he is a Father, wee conſider that he is willing to pleaſure vs, in that wee demaund; in ſaying hee is in heauen as Lord & maſter of the world, we vnderſtande that he can do ſo much as he wil. Finally, in ſaying he is a Father, we remember that we are children of God, & heires of heauen, in ſaying he is in heauen; & conſidering that we are on earth, we remēber that we haue not the poſſeſsion of our inheritance, but that wee are pilgrims and trauellers, in a land of our enemies, and therefore ſtand in great neede of his helpe.
            
            
               
               S
               Declare (if you pleaſe) vnto mee all the words in particular.
            
            
               M
               The worde Father, albeit it belongeth to God, as he is Father of all things by creation, yet in this prayer, it is vnderſtood of God, as hee is the Father of good Chriſtians by adoption. It is true alſo that ſinners may ſay vnto God, Our father, who deſire to be conuerted to him, & to become his childrē. And only thoſe cannot truly ſaye, the Pater noſter, who neither are, nor deſire to be the children of God, not thinking at all of amending themſelues.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore is it ſaid, Our Father, and not my Father?
            
            
               M
               It is ſaid, Our Father, to the end wee may vnderſtand that we are all brethren, and as brethren ought to loue, and be vnited together, being the children of one & the ſame Father. It is alſo ſaid, Our Father, to teach vs, that a cōmon praier is better

then a priuate, and more profitable alſo vnto him that doth pray: for that whiles each one ſaith: Our Father, euerie one prayeth for al, and al pray for euerie one.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore is it ſaid, Which are in heauen? is not God in al places?
            
            
               M
               God is ſaid to dwel in heauen, not for that he is not in al places: but becauſe heauen is the moſt noble part of the world, and in it doth appeare the greatnes, powre, and wiſdome of God. Finally in it, God vouchſafeth to be ſeene face to face, of the Angels, and bleſſed men. It may be alſo ſaid, that God is in heauen, becauſe he dwelleth in a perticuler manner, in the Angels, & in holie mē, who are ſpiritual heauens.
            
            
               S
               Let vs now come vnto the firſt petition, what meaneth: Hallowed be thy name?
            
            
               M
               Name in this place, ſignifieth ſame and renoume, as when we ſay

that one hath a great name, becauſe he is knowne of manie. Or that he hath a good name, or an euil name; becauſe he hath a good fame, or an euil fame, being knowne of manie and commended for good, or diſcommended for bad. Wherefore to ſanctifie the name of God, is nothing els, then to publiſh through the world the knowledge of God, & to conſerue it pure and holie in the hartes and mouthes of men, as in it ſelfe it is. And becauſe there are in the world manie infidels, who know not God, and manie euil Chriſtians, that blaſpheme & curſe him, therefore thoſe that are the children of God, and haue zeale of the honour of their father, do praie with great deſire, that his name may be ſanctified, that is, that it be through the whole world knowen, adored, cōfeſſed, praiſed & bleſſed, as is conueniēt
            
            
               S
               Seing wee deſire, that God bee

knowen, and praiſed of men, were it not better to demand it of men, thē of God.
            
            
               M
               Man is not able of him ſelf, neither to knowe, nor to praiſe God, & therfore we demand of God, that he wil worke with his grace in that maner, that the Infidels, and other ſinners may be conuerred, & being conuered, beginne to know & praiſe his holie name.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore is the prayer begune with demanding, that the name of God be ſanctified?
            
            
               M
               We are bound to loue God aboue al things, & more then our ſelues; & therefore our firſt, & moſt frequent deſire ought to be of the glorie of God, and for this cauſe were we created, and endued with reaſon, to the end we may know, and praiſe God: wherein alſo doth conſiſt our chifeſt good, as we ſhal ſay here after.
            
            
               S
               Declare vnto me now the ſecond

petition: Thy kingdome come,
            
            
               M
               In this petition, in fit place we demand our owne ſaluation, after that in the firſt we demanded the glorie of God?
            
            
               S
               What is to be vnderſtood, by the kingdome of God?

               The kingdome of God may be vnderſtood three maner of waies: for we finde a kingdome of nature, a kingdom of grace, and a kingdome of glorie. The kingdome of nature is that, where with God gouerneth al the creatures, as abſolute Lord of al things. For albeit peruerſe men do euil, and obſerue not the law of God, yet God doth raigne ouer thē, for that when it pleaſeth him he hindereth their diſignmentes. And though he permit them ſometimes to haue their deſires, afterwardes hee puniſheth them ſeuerely: and there is none that can reſiſt his wil, nor that can do otherwiſe, then he

ordaineth or permitteth. The kingdome of grace is that, wherewith God gouerneth & ruleth the ſoules, & harts of good Chriſtians, giuing them ſpirite and grace to ſerue him willingly, & to ſeeke his glorie aboue all things. The kingdome of glorie ſhalbe in the other life, after the day of iudgement: for that then God wil raigne with all the Saints, ouer all things created, without any reſiſtāce For thē al the force of the diuels ſhal be taken away, & alſo of al peruerſe men, who ſhalbe ſhut vp in eternall priſon of hel. In that time ſhal death alſo be extinguiſhed, & corruption, with al the tentations of the world & of the fleſh, which now trouble the ſeruāts of God. So that ſhalbe quiet & peaceable kingdome, with ſecure poſſeſsiō of perfect & eternal felicity
            
            
               S
               Which of theſe three kingdomes 
                     •
                  s ſpoken of, in this petition?
            
            
               M
               Not of the firſt: for that is not to

come, but is now come. Neither of the ſecond, for that is ſpoken of in the firſt petition, & is in a great part already come. But here is ſpoken of the third, which is to come, and is expected with great deſire, of al thoſe that know the miſerie of this life: & ſo in this petition we demand our chiefe good, and the perfect glory of both ſoule and bodie.
            
            
               S
               If the kingdome of God (which we deſire may comequickly) ſhal begin after the day of Iudgment, then we deſire & demand that this world ſhould ſpeedely end, & that the day of iudgement ſhould come ſhortly.
            
            
               M
               So it is: for thought the louers of the world can haue no worſe newes, then to heare the day of Iudgement named: yet the citiznes of heauen, who liue now as pilgrimes, and baniſhed men here below in earth, haue no other greater deſire: Where vpon S. Auguſtin ſaith, that like as

before Chriſt came into the world, al the deſires of the Saincts of the ancient law, were directed to the firſt comming of Chriſt: ſo now al the deſires of holie men of the new law, are directed to the ſecond comming of the ſame Chriſt, which wil bring vs perfect beatitude.
            
            
               S
               Let vs paſſe vnto the third petition. What do thoſe wordes ſignifie: Thy wil be done, in earth, as it is in heauen.
            
            
               M
               In theſe words is demanded grace, to obſerue wel the law of god. For that the eternal life, which is the end of man being demanded in the ſecond petition, it was conuenient, that the principal meanes to arriue vnto that end ſhould be demanded next after: & this principal meanes is the obſeruing of the commandements of God, as our lord hath ſaid: if thou wilt enter into eternall life: keep the commandements: & for ſo

much as wee are not able of our ſelues, to kepe all the commandements in ſuch ſorte as we ought, therefore we demand of God, that his wil be done by vs: that is, that he geue vs grace to fulfil his wil, in obeying wholly, and in al things his holie commandements.
            
            
               S
               I deſire to know, whether that beſides the fulfilling the wil of God in obſeruing the commandements, we are bound alſo to conforme our willes with Gods wil, when he ſendeth vs tribulations?
            
            
               M
               We are bound at the leſt, not to murmour, nor to grudge at the prouidence of God: becauſe al that he ſendeth or permitteth, he doth it to a good end: to wit, to giue vs occaſion of greater merite, if we be good: or els to purge vs if we be bad?
            
            
               S
               To what purpoſe is added: In earth as it is in heauen;
            
            
               M
               To teach vs, that we ought to

endeuour to obey God, and to obſerue his holie commandements, with that perfection, promptnes & gladnes, with which the Angels do obey in heauen: who neuer committed anie litle default in obſeruing al the commandements of God. It may be alſo ſaid that we deſire; and demaund, that ſinners, ſignified by the earth, may obey God, as the Saints do obey him who are ſignified by heauen, Or els that the whole Church, ſignified by the earth may intirely obey God, as Chriſt, who is ſignified by heauen, obeyd him.
            
            
               S
               Let vs come vnto the fourth petition: what meaneth, Geue vs this day our daylie bread?
            
            
               M
               With great reaſon, bread is demanded that mainteineth life, after that grace hath been demanded, which is life it ſelfe, For that the firſt thing, that anie one begining to liue deſireth, is food, where with life is

maintained. But you haue to vnderſtande, that in this prayer, ſpirituall bread is principally demaunded, which is the meate of the ſoule: and ſecondarily corporall bread, which is the food for the body. And by ſpirituall bread, is vnderſtood the moſt holy Sacrament of the altar, that is the celeſtial and diuine bread, which merueilouſly nouriſheth the life of the ſoule: & likewiſe the word of god is vnderſtood, which by preaching or reading of ſpirituall bookes, helpeth no little to nouriſh the ſame life of the ſoule. Finally is vnderſtood, the inſpiration of God, prayer, and euery other thing, which helpeth to maintaine and increaſe grace in vs, the which (as is ſaide) is the life of the ſoule. By corporall bread is vnderſtood all that is needful vnto vs, to maintaine the life of the bodie, which is as an inſtrument of the ſoule, to do good workes.
            
            
               
               S
               Wherefore is it ſaide, that this bread is ours.
            
            
               M
               With great myſterie this bread is called ours, for if we ſpeake of the bleſſed Sacrament, that is our bread, becauſe of our ſaluation it was formed by the holy ghoſt, in the wombe of the bleſſed Virgin, and in a certaine manner, bakte in the Ouen of the holy Croſſe, & ſerued vp, on the table of the Altar, by the handes of Prieſts. And moreouer it is ours, becauſe it is the bread proper of the children, and may not be giuen vnto dogges, that is to ſay, to Infidels, nor to thoſe that are in mortall ſinne. If wee ſpeake of the doctrine, wee call it our bread, to witte, that which is diſtributed by the true preachers, vnto the children of the Holy Church, and not the ſtrange bread, to wit, that which al heretikes giue vnto their followers, which is corrupt and peſtiferous bread. But if

we ſpeake of corporall bread, we defire that God will giue vs our owne bread, and not that which belongeth to others, to wit, that he wil help vs in iuſt and lawfull gaines. And againe, that he bleſſe our lands, poſſeſſions, and all our labours, to the end, that without injurie and fraud, we may procure our liuing.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore is it ſaide, that this bread is dailie?
            
            
               M
               It is called dailie, that is to ſaye, bread for euerie daye, for that wee deſire not ſuperfluous or curious things, but ſimply that which may ſuffice for the daies refection: and as well for the ſoule as for the bodie, eſpecially knowing that wee are pilgrims, and ſtrangers in this life.
            
            
               S
               Wherfore is it ſaid: Giue vnto vs?
            
            
               M
               Becauſe, albeit we are willing to labour to haue bread, as well ſpirituall as corporall, yet wee know that our labours ſhould all bee vaine, if

God concurred not with his grace: as we often ſee that how much ſoeuer men labour to ſowe and reape, yet dearth doth happen for the ſins of the world. We demaund alſo, that God giue vs our bread, that is to ſay, that not only he helpe vs to procure and gaine it, but that he alſo bleſſe and ſanctifie it, when we vſe it: that it may do vs good and be profitable both to ſoule and bodie.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore is annexed that worde this day?
            
            
               M
               The word, this day, ſignifyeth the whole time of this temporal life, and ſo we demand of God, that during the time of this life he ſuſtaine vs, with ſpiritual and corporal bread vntill wee arriue vnto our heauenly cuntrey, where we ſhall haue no need more of Sacraments of preachings, nor of corporall foode. It may be alſo ſaid, that we demand of God that he giue vs to day this bread, becauſe

wee will not bee ſolicitous for the morrow, not knowing whether wee ſhall be liuing to morrow or no. And ſo our Lorde hath taught vs, not to trouble our ſelues, with things that be not preſent. So that we demand this daye, the bread which is ſufficient for this day: & that for the morrew, we ſhal demand to morrow.
            
            
               S
               There ariſeth a new doubt to me, of that which you haue ſaide: for if wee ought not to trouble our ſelues with any thing, but with that which is preſent they doe euill, that make prouiſion of corne, of wine, and of other neceſſaries, for the whole yeare.
            
            
               M
               Our Lord, when he taught vs, not to trouble our ſelues with things not preſent, meant nothing elſe, but to deliuer vs of ſuperfluous cares, which do greatly hinder prayers, & other things of greater importance, that belong vnto the gaining of eternal life. And therefore when the

care for things to come, is not ſuperfluous: but neceſſarie, as to make ſuch prouiſion as you ſpeake of, it is not euil to think of that, which is to come. Yea rather ſuch a thought is not of the morow, but of this day: for if we ſhould not thinke of it vntill to morow, we ſhuld not haue ſo fit time
            
            
               S
               The fift petition followeth: What meaneth, And forgiue vs our debts, as we alſo forgiue our debters?
            
            
               M
               We haue already, in the foure petitions that goe before, demanded of god, that he wil giue vs all things, as wel eternall as temporal: now in the three following, we demand, that he wil deliuer vs frō al euil paſt, preſent & to come: And ſo you ſee it is true which I ſaid before, that in this praier is contained al that we can deſire. Wee demaund then in this petition, that God deliuer vs from euill, that is paſte, to witte, from the ſinnes which wee haue committed, ſo

for ſo our Lorde declared vnto the holy Apoſtles, when he taught them this prayer; that by debts they ought to vnderſtand ſinnes.
            
            
               S
               For what cauſe are ſinnes called debts?
            
            
               M
               For three cauſes. Firſt, becauſe euery man that ſinneth, remaineth debter to ſatisfie God for the injurie which he hath done him. Secondly, becauſe he that ſinneth, doth tranſgreſſe the law of God; and becauſe the ſame lawe promiſeth rewarde to all that obſerue it, and puniſhment to him that doth not obſerue it, therefore he that obſerueth it not, remayneth debter to paye the penaltie. Thirdly, becauſe each one of vs is bound to cultiuate (or manure) the vineard of his ſoule, and to yeeld to God the fruite of his good workes. Therefore hee that doth not good workes, & much more he that doth euil works, inſteed of good, is debter

to god, who is the true lord of al vinyards: & becauſe al we do often faile aſwel in doing that we ought not, as in doing that we ought: therfore it is cōuenient that oftentimes euery day we humbly deſire of God that hee remit our debts.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore is it added, as we alſo forgiue our debters
            
            
               M
               Here likewiſe by debtes, are vnderſtood the offences iniuries, which we receiue of ouer neighbours. And wee deſire of God, that hee will pardon our offences, as wee pardon them, that haue offended vs: for that like as he who pardoneth the offences receiued of his neighbour, is more diſpoſed to receiue pardon of his offences committed againſt God ſo contrariwiſe, he that will not pardon the iniuries of his neighbour, doth make himſelfe vnworthie, that God ſhould pardon him. Finally, in ſaying that we pardon the iniuries of our neighbours, wee make knowne,

that mercie doth pleaſe vs, and that we make account, that to pardon is a magnanimous & a notable thing. To the ende that when we demande mercie of God, he may not anſwere vs, how wouldeſt thou that I ſhould vſe mercie towards thee, ſeeing thou doeſt hate mercie towards others? & how doeſt thou demand pardon of me, ſeing thou eſteemeſt pardoning as an act of a baſe minde.
            
            
               S
               Declare then vnto me, I pray you the ſixt petition. And leade vs not into tentation.
            
            
               M
               In this petitiō is demanded help againſt euil to come: to wit, againſt tentations, which are occaſions that make vs fall into ſin. Here you haue to know that principally it is demanded, that God permit vs not to bee vanquiſhed & ouercome by tētations: & becauſe tentatiōs are dangerous, & the victorie doubtful, therefore we demand alſo that God permit

vs not to bee tempted, chiefly when he ſeeth that the victorie ſhall not be ours, but the diuels: & of this you are to draw an excellent leſſon, to wit, that not only the diuel cānot ouercome vs, but alſo that he cānot ſo much as tempt vs, if God doe not permit him.
            
            
               S
               I doe not well vnderſtande that ſpeach: Lead vs not into tentatiō: for it may ſeeme to haue this ſenſe, that god vſeth to lead men into tentatiōs and that we deſire him not to do it?
            
            
               M
               To bring or lead into tentations whether it be to tempt to euil, or to cauſe one to fall into ſinne, is proper to the diuel, & pertaineth in no reſpect to God, who greately hateth ſinne. But after the manner of ſpeaking in Holie Scripture, when God is ſaid to induce or leade into tentation, it is nothing elſe, but to permit that one be tempted, or ouercome by tentation: ſo the ſenſe of this petition

is no other but as we haue ſaid, that knowing our owne weakenes & frailtie, and on the othet ſide, the ſubtiltie and force of the diuel, we deſire of God, not only that he wil not permit vs to be ouerthrowne by temptations, but alſo that he permit vs not to be tempted, if he ſee not, that we ſhall remaine victorious.
            
            
               S
               The laſt petition remaineth: But deliuer vs from euill. What euill is ſpoke of in this petition?
            
            
               M
               This laſt petition doth in parte confirme the former petitions, and partly it addeth ſome things more. And therefore it ſaith: But deliuer vs from euill, that is, I do not onely demand that thou remit vnto vs our ſinnes paſt, and defend vs from ſins to come: but moreouer, that thou deliuer vs alſo from all preſent euil. And marke well that our Lord with great wiſdome teacheth vs, to demand to be deliuered from all euill

and commeth not to particulars, as to pouertie, ſicknes, perſecutions, & the like, For that oftentimes it doth ſeeme vnto vs, that a thing is good for vs, which God doth ſee is euill. And contrariwiſe it ſeemeth to vs, that a thing is euil, which God ſeeth is good for vs. And therefore according to the inſtruction of our Lord, we demand, that he deliuer vs from all that which he ſeeth is euil for vs, be it proſperitie or aduerſitie.
            
            
               S
               What meaneth Amen?
            
            
               M
               This is an Hebrew word, & (as I haue already ſaid vnto you) it ſignifyeth, ſo be it: or, ſo it is. And as in the end of the Creed Amen ſignifyeth ſo it is, and ſo I beleeue: In like maner, in the end of the Pater noſter, Amen ſignifyeth, ſo be it, ſo I deſire, and ſo I pray that it may be done.
            
         
         
            Cap. V. The declaration of the Aue Maria.
            
               S
               NOw you haue declared to me the Pater noſter, I deſire

that you declare alſo, the Aue Maria
               
            
            
               M
               I wil do it willingly, for I deſire that you be moſt deuout to our bleſſed Ladie. The Aue Maria in our vulgar tongue is this: Haile Marie ful of grace, &c.
            
            
               S
               What meaneth it, that to the Pater noſter, the Aue Maria is ioyned, rather then anie other prayer?
            
            
               M
               For ſo much as we haue no aduocate nor interceſſor with Chriſt, more potent then his Mother, therfore when wee haue ſaid the praier, which Chriſt hath taught vs, we repaire alſo to his mother, to the end that ſhe by her interceſsion, may helpe vs to obtaine, that we haue demanded, in ſaying the Pater noſter: like as in this world, when we haue geuen a ſupplication to the Prince, wee recommend the buſines vnto the moſt potent that is in the court.
            
            
               S
               Who compoſed the Aue Maria?
               
            
            
               M
               God himſelfe hath compoſed it.

For albeit hee taught it not by his owne mouth, yet he taught it by the mouth of the Archangel Gabriel, of S. Elizabeth, and of the Church. For thoſe wordes, Haile Marie full of grace, our Lord is with thee, bleſſed art thou among women: were ſpoken by the Archangel Gabriel, but hee ſpake them as Gods embaſſadour, & ſo hee ſpake them as from God, and God ſpake them by the mouth of his Embaſſadour. Thoſe other wordes: & bleſſed is the fruit of thy wombe, Saint Elizabeth ſpake, but ſhe ſpake them whē ſhe was repleniſhed with the Holy Ghoſt, as the Euangeliſt Saint Luke teſtifyeth. Whereby it appeareth, that the holy Ghoſt ſpake them by the mouth of S. Elizabeth. Al the reſt, holy church hath added, which is gouerned & taught by the ſame holy ghoſt; ſo it may welbe ſaid that after the pater noſter which chriſt taught vs by his owne mouth, the

                  Aue Maria is the moſt excellent prayer that can be found: being cō
                  poſed by the ſame God, & taught vs by the mouth of his ſeruants.
            
            
               S
               Let vs come thē to the declaratiō Wherefore do we ſay, Haile Marie?
            
            
               M
               This is a ſalutation, which we geue vnto her, to ſhew that we are friendes and of acquaintance, and therefore dare come to ſpeake vnto her, and we vſe the words of the Angel, for that we know that ſhe is pleaſed to heare often that newes which the Angell brought her, when hee ſpake the ſame wordes: and ſhee rejoyceth alſo, that wee are mindefull thereof, and that we are gratefull to God for ſo great a benefite.
            
            
               S
               What meaneth, Full of grace?
            
            
               M
               The grace of God worketh three principall effects in the ſoule. It wipeth out the ſinnes which are as ſpottes that defile the ſoule: it adorneth the ſame ſoule with giftes and

vertues: and finallie, it in-ableth to doe meritorious workes, gratefull to the diuine Majeſtie. Our Ladie is full of grace, becauſe touching the firſt effect, ſhe neuer had any ſpot of ſinne, neither Original nor Actuall, neither mortal nor venial: Touching the ſecond, ſhe had al the vertues & gifts of the holy ghoſt, in the higheſt degree. Touching the third, ſhe did works ſo gratefull vnto God, and ſo meritorious, that ſhe was worthie to be aſſumpted in bodie and ſoule aboue al the orders of Angels.
            
            
               S
               It ſeemeth not that our Ladie had more grace then other Saints. For I haue often heard that S. Stephen & other Saints were full of grace.
            
            
               M
               How much ſoeuer it is ſaid of other Saints, that they were full of grace, yet our Ladie had moſt grace of them al: for that ſhe was made by God capable of more grace, then any other Saints: as for example if

manie veſſels one greater then an other were filled with balme, al ſhould be ful, & yet in the greateſt ſhould be more balme, then in the others. And the reaſon of this is, becauſe God doeth make men capable of more or leſſe grace, according to the offices which he geueth them. And for ſo much as the greateſt office that hath been geuen to a meere creature, was to be the Mother of God, therefore our Ladie was made capable of, & filled with more grace then anie other meere creature.
            
            
               S
               What meaneth, Our Lord is with thee?
            
            
               M
               this is an other ſingular praiſe of the bleſſed virgin which ſignifieth to vs that our Lord hath bene with our Ladie from the beginning of her conception, with a perpetual aſsiſtance, gouerning her, directing her, and defending her. And hereof it commeth that ſhe neuer committed

anie ſinne, either in thought, in worde, or in deed. Wherevpon God hath not only adorned this moſt holy virgin with al graces, but he would alſo remaine alwaies with her as guardian of ſo great a treaſure.
            
            
               S
               What meaneth, Bleſſed art thou among women?
            
            
               M
               This is the third praiſe, which is geuen to our B. Ladie, in which is declared, that ſhe is not only ful of al the graces, which can belong to a virgin: but of thoſe alſo which can belong vnto a wife, and therby doth abſolutly ſurpaſſe al other women, which haue bene, or ſhal be. The benediction of a married woman is fecunditie, and this was not wanting to the bleſſed Virgin, ſeeing ſhee hath brought foorth a childe, which is more worth, then a hundreth thouſand Children. It may alſo be ſaid, that ſhee is a Mother of a verie great number of Children: for that

all good Chriſtians are brothers to Chriſt, and conſequently are childrē to our Ladie, not by birth and nature, in which maner only Chriſt is her childe: but by loue and motherlie affection, which ſhe had towards all. Whereupon ſhe is worthely ſaid to bee bleſſed amongſt all women: becauſe others had either the glorie of virginitie without fecunditie, or the benediction of fecunditie without Virginitie: ſhe only had joyntlie by a ſinguler priuiledge of God, the honour of perfect virginitie, with the benediction of the higheſt and moſt happie fecunditie.
            
            
               S
               What meaneth. And bleſſed is the fruit of thy wombe Ieſus.
            
            
               M
               This is the fourth praiſe, which is giuen to our Ladie, that ſhe is not onely worthy of honour, for that ſhe hath in her ſelfe: but for that alſo, which is in the fruit of her wombe. Becauſe the praiſe of the fruite redoundeth

to the tree, and the glorie of the child redoundeth to the mother. And becauſe Ieſus is not onlie true man, and bleſſed amongſt men; but is alſo God, bleſſed aboue all things, as S. Paul teacheth vs, therefore his mother is not onely bleſſed amongſt women; but ſhee is bleſſed amongſt all the creatures, as well in earth as in heauen.
            
            
               S
               Declare vnto me I pray you that which remaineth of the Aue Maria.
               
            
            
               M
               In the words following, the holy Church repeating the principall praiſe of our Ladie, which is to bee the mother of God, and ſo ſhewing, that ſhe can obtain of the ſame God what ſhee pleaſeth, deſireth her to make interceſsion for vs, who haue great need thereof being ſinners, & that ſhe help vs while we liue, and in particular, at the poynt of death, when we ſhal be in greateſt danger.
            
            
               S
               I would gladly know, wherefore it

ring to the Aue Maria, three times in the day, to wit, in the morning, at midday, and in the euening.
            
            
               M
               To the end we may vnderſtand, that we haue need to make recourſe often to the helpe of God, and of the Saints: being in the middeſt of enemies viſible & inuiſible. And that we ought not to thinke it ſufficient to haue recourſe to the armour of praier in the beginning of our works but that we muſt do the ſame in the progreſſe and in the end. There is alſo an other myſterie in this ringing thriſe to the Aue Maria. That is, holie Church would haue vs continually to remember the three principal myſteries of our Redemptiō, the Incarnation, the Paſsion, and the Reſurrection. And therfore willeth that wee ſalute our B. Ladie in the morning, in memorie of the Reſurrection of our lord: at midday, in memorie of the paſsion: & at night, in memory

of the Incarnation. Becauſe as we are certaine that our Lord was mayled on the Croſſe at midday, & roſe in the morning, ſo it is probably thought, that the Incarnation was in the night.
            
         
         
            Cap. VI. The declaration of the ten Commandements.
            
               S
               HAuing now vnderſtood the Creede, and the Pater noſter with the Aue Maria: I deſire that you would declare vnto mee the ten commandements of the law of God: for that this is the third principall part of the chriſtian doctrine, as you told me in the beginning.
            
            
               M
               You haue reaſon to deſire to learne, & to vnderſtand well the ten cōmandements of the law of god, be cauſe that faith and hope without charity, & without obſeruing of the 
                     •
                  aw, are not ſufficient to ſaluation.
            
            
               S
               What is the cauſe, that ſeing in the world, & in the Church there are ſo

many lawes and commandements, this lawe of the Commandements is preferred before all the reſt?
            
            
               M
               Many reaſons may be alleadged concerning the excellencie of this law. Firſt, for that this law was made by God, & written by himſelfe, firſt of all in the hearts of men, & afterwards in twotables of ſtone: ſecondly, becauſe this is moſt ancient lawe of all others, & as the fountain of all the reſt. Thirdly, becauſe this is moſt vniuerſal law that is to be found: for it bindeth not onely Chriſtians but Iewes alſo & Gentils: aſwell men as wemen, aſwell rich as poore, aſwell Princes as priuate men, aſwell the learned as the ignorāt. Fourthly, becauſe this law is immutable & cānot be taken away, nor diſpenſed withal by any. Fiftly, becauſe it is neceſſary to euery one to ſaluation, as our lord hath often taught vs, in his holy goſpel; laſtly, bceauſe it was promulgat

with greateſt ſolemnity in mount Sinay with ſound of Angelical trūpets with great thunder, and lightning from heauen, in the preſence of al the people of God.
            
            
               S
               Before you come to the declaration of the commandementes in particular; it would be gratful to me to vnderſtand briefly the ſumme, and order of them?
            
            
               M
               The end of al the commandementes is the loue of God, and of our neighbour: for they al teach vs, not to offend God, nor our neighbour: and for this cauſe they are diuided into two partes and were written (as I haue already ſaid) in two tables of ſtone. The firſt part contayneth, three commandementes, which inſtruct vs of the bond wee haue to God. The ſecond containeth ſeuen other precepts, which teach vs the bond, we haue to our neighbour. But you muſt know, that albeit

in one table there were no more then three precepts, & in the other ſeauē: yet the two tables were equall, and both full written: for the three firſt were written with more words, and the other ſeauen with fewer: and ſo the ſeauen ſhorter precepts were equal touching the writing vnto the three longer.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore are the Commandements of the firſt table three?
            
            
               M
               Becauſe they teach vs to loue God, with hart, with tongue, & with worke.
            
            
               S
               Why are the commandementes of the ſecond table ſeauen?
            
            
               M
               Becauſe, one teacheth vs to do good to our neighbour, the other ſix teach vs to do him no euil. Firſt in his perſon, after in his honour, laſtly in his goodes. And that neither in thought, worde, nor deede.
            
            
               S
               Let vs now come vnto the commandementes them ſelues. And firſt

ſhew mee the wordes where with they were writen by God in thoſe tables.
            
            
               M
               The wordes are theſe: I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee forth, out of the land of Egypt, from the houſe of ſeruitude.
               
                  
                     
                        1 Thou ſhalt not haue ſtrange Gods in my ſight.
                     
                        2 Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine.
                     
                        3 Remember that thou ſanctifie the Sabbaoth day.
                     
                        4 Honour thy father & thy mother.
                     
                        5 Thou ſhalt not murder.
                     
                        6 Thou ſhalt not commit adultrie.
                     
                        7 Thou ſhalt not ſteale.
                     
                        8 Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witnes againſt thy neighbour.
                     
                        9 Thou ſhalt not deſire thy neighbours wife.
                     
                        10 Thou ſhalt not couet the neighbours goods.
                  
               
            
            
               S
               What meane thoſe wordes which

goe before the commandementes?
            
            
               M
               In thoſe words are yelded foure reaſons, to ſhew that God can geue a law, and that we are bounde to obſerue it. The firſt reaſon is in the word, I am the Lord, becauſe God being our chief and higheſt Lord, who hath created vs of nothing, he may doubtles geue vs a law, as to his proper ſeruants. The ſecond is in that word, God, becauſe that word ſignifieth that our Lord is not only Lord (or Maiſter) but he is alſo ſupreme Iudge, and gouernour, and as ſuch a one can geue a law, and puniſh thoſe that obſerue it not. The third is in that word, thine, becauſe beſides the bond which we haue to obey God, as ſeruants their maiſter and as ſubiects their Prince; we haue an other bond, by reaſon of the packt which God doth make with vs, and we with him, in holie Baptiſme. For therein God taketh vs for his owne

adopted children, and we take him for our proper Father: as God alſo taketh all the faithfull for his particular people, and the faithfull take God for their owne proper God and Lord. The fourth is in thoſe wordes, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of ſeruitude; for that beſides ſo manie other bondes, there is this of gratitude: for that God hath deliuered vs from the ſeruitude of the diuel & of ſin, which was ſignifyed by that ſeruitude of Egipt and of Pharao, from the which the ſame God deliuered the people of the Iewes.
            
            
               
                  S
                  Declare vnto mee now the firſt commandement.
               
               
                  M
                  The firſt Commandement containeth three parts. The firſt is, that we ought to haue God for God. The ſecond, that we muſt not take any other thing for God. The third, that wee muſt not make Idols, to wit,

ſtatues or Images, taking them for Gods, and that we muſt not adore the ſame Idols.
               
               
                  S
                  Declare vnto me the firſt part.
               
               
                  M
                  God will be taken for that which he is, to wit, for true God, which is done by exerciſing foure vertues towards his diuine Majeſtie, to wit, Faith, Hope, Charitie, and Religion. Hee that beleeueth in God, taketh God for God: becauſe he taketh him for the chiefe veritie: and in this the Heretiks do ſinne, for they doe not beleeue in him. Hee that hopeth in God, taketh God for God, for that he holdeth him for moſt faithful, moſt pittifull, and alſo moſt potent, confidently conſidering that he can, and wil help him in al his neceſsities: & in this poynt thoſe do ſin, that deſpaire of the mercy of god, or do truſt more in men, thē in god, or ſo much in mē as in God, he that loueth god aboue all thinges, taketh God for God, for

that hee taketh him for the chiefe goodneſſe, and in this poynt thoſe do ſin, that loue any creature whatſoeuer more then god, or equal with God. And much more doe they ſin, that hate God. Finallie, whoſoeuer adoreth god with greateſt reuerence as the vertue of Religion teacheth vs, taketh god for god: for he taketh him for the firſt beginning and author of all things, and in this poynt they offend, that beare ſmall reſpect to God, and to thinges conſecrated vnto him, as Churches, hallowed veſſels, Prieſtes, and the like, and thoſe alſo that honour men equally with God, or more then God.
               
               
                  S
                  Declare I praye you the ſecond part of this commandement.
               
               
                  M
                  In the ſecond part God willeth and commandeth, that wee take no created thing for God. And in this the Gentils offended in olde time, who not knowing the true God, did

take and adore for God diuers creatures, as the Sunne, the Moone, or ſome dead men. In the ſame Inchanters & Witches offend, and al Sorcerers, Negromancers, and Soothſayers, who gaue to the diuel of hell that honour which is due onely to God; & ſome of them take him and adore him for their God, and thinke by his meanes to fore-tell things to come, or to find treaſures, or to attain vnto other their diſhoneſt deſires.
                  For the diuel being deadly enemy to all mankinde, deceiueth often this poore ſort of people, and with vaine hopes cauſeth thē to commit many ſins, & in the end to looſe their ſouls and many times their bodies alſo.
               
               
                  S
                  Declare to me the third part.
               
               
                  M
                  In the third parte, God doeth command, that not only we take not the things created by him for God, as hath ben ſaide, but that much leſſe wee make to our ſelues any

thing to take it & adore it for God. Wherein the Gentils offended, who were ſo blinde, that they made Idols, to wit, ſtatues of Gold, or of ſiluer or of wood, or of ſtone, and made it be thought that they were Gods. Chiefly becauſe the diuels ſome-times entred into them, and cauſed them to ſpeake or to mooue themſelues, & ſo they ſacrificed vnto them, and adored them. And becauſe the holy Martirs would not in any wiſe do the ſame, they put them to death, with moſte cruell torments.
               
               
                  S
                  Is there any thing elſe in this commandement?
               
               
                  M
                  There is annexed by God a terrible threatning, to thoſe that doe contrarie to this commandemēt, & a great promiſe to thoſe that obſerue it. For after the giuing of the commandemēt, God ſpake thoſe words, I am a jealous God, who puniſh

not only thoſe that loue me not, but their poſteritie alſo, vnto the fourth generation, and ſhewe mercie to thoſe that loue me, vnto a thouſand generations. Where, marke well, that our Lorde ſaith, that he is a jealouſe God, to the ende wee may vnderſtande that he can puniſh moſt grieuouſly, becauſe hee is God, and that he will puniſh moſt grieuouſly, becauſe he is jealous of his honour, and of juſtice, and of right: and therefore cannot beare with impietie and iniquitie. Which is againſt thoſe that ſinne continually, & yet liue merily, as if God had no care therof. But by this you ſee God hath care, & wil ſhew it when time is.
               
               
                  S
                  What meane thit, that God puniſheth ſuch as do euil, vnto the fourth generation: and giueth rewarde vnto thoſe that doe well vnto a thouſand generations?
               
               
                  M
                  God puniſheth vnto the fourth

generation, for that for the moſt part a man doth not liue longer then to ſee the children of his Nephewes, or at the moſte, the Nephewes to his Nephewes, & he will not puniſh others of his poſteritie, then the ſinner himſelfe may ſee. But in doing well, God extended himſelfe not only vnto the fourth generation, but vnto a thouſande, if there were ſo manie. For that our Lord is more inclined to reward then to puniſh, becauſe that hee rewardeth, is of his owne goodneſſe, and therefore hee doth it very willingly, but that hee puniſheth any, it commeth of our ſinne, and therefore hee doth it as it were perforce, to wit, vrged by our peruerſeneſſe.
               
               
                  S
                  Wherefore is this threat, and this promiſe joyned to the firſt commandement onely?
               
               
                  M
                  Becauſe this is the principall commandement, & of more importance

then the reſt. Againe, for that it is the firſt, and ſo being ſpoken of the firſt, it may be vnderſtood alſo of the reſt.
               
               
                  S
                  I deſire to know how the honour which wee giue to Saints and their Reliques and Images, is not againſt this commandement. For it ſeemeth, that wee adore all theſe things, ſeeing we kneele vnto them and praye vnto them as we do vnto God.
               
               
                  M
                  The holie Church is the ſpouſe of God, and hath the holy Ghoſt for her maſter. And therefore there is no danger that ſhe ſhould be deceiued, or that ſhe ſhould doe or teach others to do any thing that were againſt the commandements of God. And to come to the particular, wee doe honour and call vpon Saintes, as friends of God, who can helpe vs with their merits and prayers before him: but wee doe not take them

for gods, neither adore them as God: neither importeth it that we knele, becauſe this reuerance is not proper to God alone: but is done alſo vnto creatures of high dignitie, as to the Pope: and in manie places religious perſons kneele vnto their Superiours So that it is no maruel if that be done vnto ſainctes, who raigne with Chriſt in heauen. which is done vnto ſome men in earth.
               
               
                  S
                  But what ſhal we ſay of the Reliques of Saincts, which vnderſtand nothing: and yet we kneele and pray vnto them?
               
               
                  M
                  We do not pray to the Reliques which we know wel do not vnderſtand: but we honour the holie Reliques, as thoſe which haue bin the inſtruments of the holy ſoules, to do many good workes, and ſhal againe in their times be liuing bodies, and are to vs in the meane time deare pledges of the loue, which the Saints

did, & do beare vnto vs. And therefore we doe praye, before the ſame Reliques vnto the Saintes, deſiring them by theſe deare pledges which we keepe of them, that they remember to helpe vs, as wee remember to honour them.
               
               
                  S
                  The ſame perhaps may be ſaid of Images.
               
               
                  M
                  So it is, for the Images of our Lord, of our Ladie, & other Saints, are not taken by vs for gods: & therefore they cannot be called Idols, as thoſe were of the Gentils: but they are holden for Images, which make vs to remember our Lord, our Ladie, and other Saints: & ſo they ſerue ſuch as cānot read in place of books. For that by Images they learne many myſteries of our holy faith: & the life and death of many Saints. And the honour we do vnto them, we do it not becauſe they are figures of paper or of mettal, or becauſe they are

well-coloured & wel made: but becauſe they repreſent vnto vs our Lord, our Ladie, or other Saints: and for that we know that the Images do not liue nor haue ſenſe, being made by the hands of men: we do not demand any thing of thē: but we pray before them, vnto thoſe whom they repreſent vnto vs, to wit, our Lorde, our Ladie, or other Saints.
               
               
                  S
                  If Reliques and Images doe not vnderſtād: how then do they worke ſo many miracles to ſuch as doe recommend themſelues vnto them?
               
               
                  M
                  God worketh al the miracles: but he worketh them often by the interceſsion of Saints, and chiefly of our bleſſed Ladie: & oftentimes he doth them vnto thoſe, who praye vnto the Sainctes before their Reliques or Images, and ſometimes hee vſeth the Reliques and Images, as inſtruments of ſuch miracles, to ſhew vnto vs, that our deuotion towards

the Saincts, and towards their Reliques, and Images, doth pleaſe him.
               
               
                  S
                  When therefore it is ſaid, that one is recommended to ſuch Reliques, or ſuch Images, and hath receiued grace, it is to be vnderſtood, that he is recommended to that Sainct, to whom thoſe Reliuques or Images pertaine: and that God, by the interceſſion of that Sainct, and by the meanes of thoſe Reliques or Images, hath done him that grace.
               
               
                  S
                  So it is: and I am glad that you haue well vnderſtood al that I haue ſaid vnto you.
               
               
                  S
                  I would laſtlie knowe for what cauſe, God the Father is paynted like an old man, and the Holy Ghoſt like a Doue, and the Angels like young men with wings, ſeeing God and the Angels are ſpirits, and haue no corporall figure, which can bee drawen by Painters, as pictures of men may be.
               
               
                  
                  M
                  When God the Father is painted in forme of an old man, and the Holie Ghoſt in forme of a doue, and the Angles in forme of young-men, that which they are in themſelues is not painted: becauſe as you haue ſaid, they are ſpirits without bodies, but that forme is painted, in which they haue ſomtimes appeared. And ſo God the Father is painted like an old-man, becauſe he appeared in that forme in a viſion to Daniel the prophet. And the Holie Ghoſt is painted in forme of a doue, becauſe in that forme he appeared vpō Chriſt when he was baptiſed by Saint Iohn Baptiſt. And the Angls are painted in forme of yong men, for that they haue ſomtimes ſo appeared. Moreouer you are to know, that manie thinges are painted, to make vs vnderſtand, not what they are in themſelus, but what properties they haue or what effecte they vſe to worke.

So it may be ſaid, that God the Father is painted in forme of an olde man, to make vs vnderſtand, that he is moſt ancient, to wit, eternal, & before al created things. And the Holie Ghoſt is painted in likenes of of a doue, to ſignifie the giftes of innocencie, puritie, & ſanctitie, which the Holie Ghoſt worketh in vs. And the angels are painted like yong mē, becauſe they are alwaies, faire & ful of ſtrength: and with winges, becauſe they are readie to paſſe whyther it ſhal pleaſe God to ſend them: and with white garments, and with holie ſtoales, becauſe they are pure, and innocent, and miniſters of his diuine Maieſtie.
               
            
            
               Of the ſecond commandement.
               
                  S
                  LEt vs come to the ſecond cō
                     mandement: what meaneth, thou ſhalt not take the name of God in vaine?
               
               
                  M
                  In this cōmandement is handled

the honour and diſhonor of God touching wordes, that is, honour is commanded, and diſhonour is forbidden. And this commandement: may be deuided into foure partes, becauſe God is honored, or diſhonored by wordes, in foure ſortes. Firſt, God is honored by naming him often with charitable affection: and is diſhonored by often naming him to no good purpoſe. Secondly, he is honored by an oath, and he is diſhonored by perjurie. Thirdly, he is honored by obſeruation of vowes, & diſhonored by breaking of vowes once made. Fourthly, hee is honored by calling vpon him and praiſing him, and diſhonored by blaſpheaming and curſing him.
               
               
                  S
                  Declare to me the firſt part.
               
               
                  M
                  In ſimply naming God, as alſo our Ladie and other Saintes, one may well doe an euil. For thoſe that 
                        •
                     oue God much, remember him

often, and often ſpeake of him: and they do it with deuotion & affection, as is ſeen in the Epiſtles of Saint. Paul, where the holie name of Ieſus Chriſt is very often read. For as S. Paul had Chriſt in his hart, ſo he had him in his mouth. But there be others, who of an euil cuſtome, whē they are angrie, or when they ieſt, not regarding what they ſay, name God, or ſome Saint, becauſe nothing els comes to their mind. And this is euil: for it is a kinde of tearing the moſt holie name of God. Which is to geue you an example, though not equal) as if one hauing a pretious garment, ſhould weare it in all places and at al times, not regarding the preciouſnes thereof.
               
               
                  S
                  Declare nowe the ſecond part, which concerneth ſwearing,
               
               
                  M
                  An oath or ſwearing is nothing els, but to cal God as witnes of the truth. But that it be lawfully done

three things ought to accompany it, to wit, truth, juſtice & judgement, as God himſelfe doth teach vs, by the mouth of the Prophet Ieremy. And as God is honored by an oath made with dew circumſtances, we profeſsing therby, that he ſeeth al things and is the ſoueraigne truth, & defē
                     der of the trueth: ſo by the contrary the ſame god is greatly diſhonoured when an oath is made without truth or without iuſtice, or without judgement: for he that ſo ſweareth maketh ſhew that either God is ignorant of the matter, or that hee is a friend of lying and of antiquitie.
               
               
                  S
                  Declare I pray in particular, what is to ſweare with truth.
               
               
                  M
                  That one may ſweare with truth it is neceſſary that he do not affirme with an oth any thing but that hee certainely knoweth to be true: and that he promiſe not with an oth any thing but that he will vndoubtedly

performe. Whereupon they are periured, and ſinne greeuouſly, that affirme with an oath ſuch thinges as they know are falſe, or do not know to be true. And in like maner, thoſe that promiſe by oath, that which they meane not to fulfil.
               
               
                  S
                  What meaneth to ſweare with iuſtice?
               
               
                  M
                  The meaning is, that a man promiſe not with an oath, to do anie thing, but that which is lawful. And therfore they ſinne moſt greeuouſly who promiſe with an oath, to reuenge injuries, or to do anie thing that diſpleaſeth God. Neither ought they to obſerue ſuch promiſes: neither do they binde in anie ſort. For no man can be bound to do euil, for ſo much as the law of God bindeth vs that we muſt not do it.
               
               
                  S
                  What meaneth to ſweare with iudgement?
               
               
                  M
                  The meaning is, to ſweare with

aduiſement, & maturely: cōſidering that it is not conuenient to call God to witneſſe, but in needful things of great importance, and with much feare and reuerence. And therefore they offend, that for euerie trifle, yea playing & jeaſting do ſweare. Who by this euil cuſtome of ſwearing often do eaſely incurre perjurie, which is one of the greateſt ſinnes that can be committed. Whereupon aſwell our Lord in the Goſpel, as S. Iames in his Epiſtle do command that wee do not ſweare, that is, without neceſſitie. And holie men doe yeelde the reaſō thereof, becauſe an oath being inuented for remedy of the weaknes of a mans credit: for that men doe hardly beleeue one an other, therfore an oath ought to be vſed, as we vſe a medicine, which is not oftē to be taken, but as ſeldome, as well may be.
               
               
                  S
                  Declar then, if you pleaſe, the third part of this commandement,

which conſiſteth in vowes?
               
               
                  M
                  A Vowe is a promiſe made to God of ſome good thing grateful to his diuine Majeſtie. Where you haue to conſidder three things. Firſt that a Vowe is a promiſe, and therefore it ſufficeth not to the making of a Vowe to haue a purpoſe, & much leſſe a deſire to do any thing: but the expreſſe promiſe is required, either by word of mouth, or at the leaſt in heart. Againe you haue to conſider, that this promiſe is to be made to God, to whom Vowes doe properly belong. And when you heare that a Vow is made to our Ladie, or to other Saints, you muſt vnderſtande that the ſame is principally made to God, but in the honour of our Lady, or other Saints, in whome God remaineth in a more particular maner and more excellently then in other creatures. So that a Vow made to a Saint is nothing elſe but a promiſe

made vnto God, to honour the memorie of ſuch a Saint, with ſome preſent: that is to honour God himſelf in his Saint. Thirdly, you haue to know, that a Vow cannot be made but of a good thing, and grateful to God, as holy virginitie, voluntarie pouertie, and the like things. Wherfore he that ſhould vowe to commit anie ſinne, or anie act not pertaining to the ſeruice of God; yea or anie good thing, which ſhould hinder a greater good, ſhould not make promiſe of a thing grateful to his diuine Maieſtie, and therefore ſhould not do him honour, but diſhonour, and he ſhould ſinne againſt this ſecond commandement. As he alſo ſinneth greeuiouſly againſt the ſame commandement, that maketh a vow and fulfilleth it not ſo ſoone as he can. For God commandeth in holie Scripture, that whoſoeuer maketh a vowe, do not only remember to fulfill

it, but alſo that hee ſlacke not to do it.
               
               
                  S
                  Declare to me the laſt part, which treateth of the praiſe of God, and of blaſphemie.
               
               
                  M
                  God commādeth in the laſt part of this ſeconde commandement, that a man ſhal not blaſpheame: but contrariwiſe, that he praiſe & bleſſe his holy name. And firſt, foraſmuch as appertaineth to the praiſe, there is no difficultie at all: being manifeſt that all good things comming vnto vs from God, and all the works of God being full of wiſdome, of juſtice, and of mercie; it is reaſon that in all things he be praiſed, and bleſſed. But touching blaſpheamie, it is neceſſary you know that blaſphemy is nothing elſe, but an injury done in wordes to God in himſelfe or in his Saints. And there are found ſix ſorts of blaſphemies. The firſt, when that is attributed to God, which is falſe,

as that he hath hornes, or like indignitie. The ſecond, when that is denied to God, which belongeth to him, as Power, Wiſdome, Iuſtice, or other excellences. As to ſay that God can not do, or ſeeth ſome things, or that he is not iuſt. The third, whē that is tributed to any creature, which is proper to God, as if one ſay, that the diuel knoweth the things that are to come, or can worke true miracles. The fourth, when one curſeth God, or our Ladie, or other Saints. The fift, when ſome members of Chriſt, or of Saints are named, to doe ſome injurie, as if there were any things in them to bee aſhamed of, as be in vs. The ſixt, when one nameth ſome parts of Chriſt or of Saints, to jeſt at them, as to ſaye: To the bread of Chriſt: or of Saint Peter: or other like things: which the enuie of the diuel, and the wickedneſſe of man hath found out.
               
               
                  
                  S
                  I deſire to know howe great the ſin of blaſphemie is?
               
               
                  M
                  It is ſo great, that it is in a maner the greateſt of all other: which may be vnderſtood by the pain that it meriteth. For that in the old Teſtament, God commandeth, that blaſphemers ſhould preſently be ſtoned by al the people. As the ciuil lawes do alſo puniſh blaſphemers with death. And S. Gregorie writeth that a litle child of fiue years old, hauing learned to blaſpheme God, and not being corrected by his father, died in his fathers lap, and his ſoule was carried away by diuels (that appeared viſibly) into hell fire. Which was neuer read to haue happened for any other ſinne. Whereby wee may ſee what diligence ought to be vſed in auoyding ſo great an offence of his diuine Maieſtie: & the auoyding of this ſinne ought to be more eaſie, ſeeing there is no commoditie nor

pleaſure gotten by it, as by ſome other ſin there is, but the onely hurt which the ſinne bringeth with it. And yet wee ought neuer to ſinne, though wee could gaine neuer ſo great cōmoditie or pleaſure thereby.
               
            
            
               Of the third Commandement.
               
                  S
                  I Haue vnderſtood the two firſt commandements: now I deſire that you wil declare to me the third.
               
               
                  M
                  The third commandemēt, which is of keeping holie feaſts, is ſomthing differing from the others, becauſe al the others, to wit, the two that go before, and the ſeauen which follow, are wholy natural, and bind not only Chriſtians, but Iewes and Gentils alſo: but this third is in part natural, and bindeth all men, & in part is not natural, neither bindeth it al: for that to ſanctifie the feaſts, that is, to haue ſome daies for holie, & to be ſpent in holie works, & chiefly in the ſeruice of God, is a naturall precept: for that

natural reaſon teacheth it to al men; and ſo in al partes of the world ſome day is obſerued feſtiual. But the ordaining of ſuch a day, that is, that it ſhould be one, rather then an other, is not natural. And therefore with the Iewes the principal feaſt was Saturdaye, with Chriſtians it is the Sunday.
               
               
                  S
                  For what cauſe did God command that the Iewes ſhould obſerue the Saturday, rather then anie other day?
               
               
                  M
                  There are two principal reaſons. The firſt is becauſe, on the Saturday God finiſhed the frame of the world: and therefore he would, that day ſhould be ſāctified in memory of this great benefite, of the creation of the world: Which ſerued alſo to conuince the error of certaine Philoſophers (who ſaid that the world had alwaies bene) for that celebrating the feaſt in memorie of the creation

of the world, it muſt needs be confeſſed that the worlde had a beginning. The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe a man hauing cauſed his ſeruants, and hand-maides, and his cattle to worke and wearie themſelues ſixe daies of the weeke, God would that the ſeauenth daye, which is the Saturday, the ſame ſeruants & maides, yea, his Oxealſo and Aſſe ſhould repoſe, and that maſters ſhould learne to bee pittifull towardes their laborers, and not to bee cruell, but to haue compaſsion alſo of their very bruit beaſtes.
               
               
                  S
                  What is the cauſe that we Chriſtians do not obſerue the Saturday, as the Iewes doe, ſeeing there is ſo good reaſon to obſerue it?
               
               
                  M
                  With great reaſō god hath changed the Saterday into the Sunday, as hee hath alſo done Circumciſion into Baptiſme, the Paſchal lambe, into the bleſſed Sacrament, & al other

good thinges of the old Teſtament, into better thinges in the new Teſtament. Wherefore, if the Saturday was celebrated in memorie of the creation of the worlde; becauſe in that day the worke of the creation was ended: with more reaſon the Sunday is celebrated in memorie of the ſame creation: for that in the ſunday the ſaid creation was begune: and if the Iewes did geue to God the laſt day of the weeke, then Chriſtians do better, who geue him the firſt. Moreouer vpon the Sunday, memorie is made of three principal benefites of our Redemption. For Chriſt was borne on the ſunday, on ſunday he roſe, and vpon Sunday he ſent the Holie Ghoſt to his Apoſtles. Finally the Saturday did ſignifie the repoſe which the holie ſoules had in Limbo: the Sunday ſignifieth the glorie which the holie ſouls haue now, and the bodies ſhal haue hereafter

in heauen. And therefore the Iewes did celebrate the Saterday, becauſe when they died they went to repoſe in Limbo: but chriſtians celebrate the ſunday, becauſe when they dye they go vnto the glorious bliſſe of heauen: which yet is vnderſtood, if they haue done wel according to the holie Law, which God hath geuen them.
               
               
                  S
                  Is it neceſſarie to obſerue other feaſtes beſides the Sunday?
               
               
                  M
                  It is neceſſarie to obſerue manie other feaſts, as well of our Lord, as of our Ladie, and of other Sainctes, to wit, al thoſe which are commanded by holie Church. But we haue ſpoken in particular of the Sunday becauſe it is the moſt ancient and oftner celebrared then anie other. As amongſt the Iewes there were alſo manie feaſte
                        •
                     , but the moſt ancient, moſt frequent, and the greateſt of al was the Sabboth. And therefore in

the ten commādements there is not expreſſe mention made of anie, but of the Sabbaoth, to which, as we haue ſaid, the Sunday hath ſucceeded.
               
               
                  S
                  What ought to be done, to obſerue the feaſtes?
               
               
                  M
                  Two things are neceſſarie: the firſt is, to bſtaine from ſeruil works: which are thoſe, that ſeruants and artificers, are accuſtomed to do, who labour moſt ſpecially with their bodies. For thoſe workes in which the vnderſtanding doth principally labour, cannot be called ſeruil, though for helpe of the vnderſtanding, the tongue, the hand, or anie other corporal member be vſed. The ſecond thing is, that in the commanded feaſtes we are bound to be preſent at the holie Sacrifice of Maſſe. And albeit holie Church bindeth vs to no more: yet is it conuenient, that we ſpend the whole day of the feaſt,

or the greateſt part thereof, in prayer, and ſpiritual reading, in viſiting Churches, in hearing ſermons, and in doing like holie exerciſes: for this is the end, for which feaſtes were inſtituted.
               
               
                  S
                  If ſeruil workes may not be done, on the feſtiual dayes, thē belles may not be rongue, the table may not be made readie, & much leſſe meate be dreſſed, for al theſe are ſeruil workes.
               
               
                  M
                  The commandement of not doing ſeruile works, is vnderſtood with two conditions. The firſt, that they bee not neceſſary to mans life, and therefore it is permitted to dreſſe meate, to make ready the table, and ſuch like that can not bee done the day before. The ſecond, that they be not neceſſary for the ſeruice of God: for which it is allowed to ring the Bels, and to doe other workes in the Church that cānot be done another day. And beſides theſe conditions,

it is alſo lawfull to do ſeruile workes, vpon the holie day, when licence is granted by the Prelate for reaſonable cauſe.
               
            
            
               Of the fourth Commandement.
               
                  S
                  THe fourth Commandement followeth, which is of honoring our father and mother. I deſire to know, wherefore the commandement of honoring our father & mother, is the firſt in the ſecond table.
               
               
                  M
                  The commandements of the ſecond table belong to our neighbour as thoſe of the firſt belong to God. And becauſe amongſt all neighbours, our father and mother are moſt neere to vs, to whom wee are moſte bounde, as of whom wee haue our being and our life, which is the foundation of all our temporall good thinges, therefore with great reaſon the ſecond table beginneth with the honour of our father and mother.
               
               
                  
                  S
                  What is vnderſtood by this honour which is due to our father and mother?
               
               
                  M
                  Three thinges are vnderſtood, helpe, obedience, & reuerence. Firſt, wee are bound to helpe & aſsiſt our father & mother in their neceſsities. And this helpe in holy Scriptures is called honour. And it is great reaſō that children hauing receiued life of their father & mother, ſhould procure to preſerue vnto them the ſame life. Further wee are bounde to obey our father & mother, as S. Paul ſaith in all things in our Lorde, that is, in all things which are conformable to the will of our Lord: for that when our father or mother commandeth vs any thing, which is contrary to the wil of God, then we muſt according to the commaundemente of Chriſt, hate our father and mother, that is, not obey or giue eare vnto them, no otherwiſe then if they were

our enimies. Finally we are bound to reuerence our father & mother in bearing them reſpect, and honoring them in words, & exterior behauior, as is conuenient: & ſo great account God made of this in the olde teſtament, that he commanded that who ſoeuer durſt curſe his father or mother, ſhould be killed.
               
               
                  S
                  I know not for what cauſe the law of God hath cōmanded the children that they ſhould help their father & mother, & to aſsiſt them: & hath not alſo commanded the fathers & mothers, that they ſhould helpe & ſuccour their children, eſpecially whiles they are little & haue need of helpe.
               
               
                  M
                  Truely the bonde is reciprocall, and all one, betwixt the parents and the children. For euen as the childrē are bound to help, to reuerence, and to obey their parents: ſo the parents are bound to prouide for the children, not only meate & clothes,

but alſo that they be taught and inſtructed. But the law of parents towardes their children, is ſo naturall and ordinarie, that there is no neede of any other written law, to put Parents in mind of their bond towards their children. But contrariwiſe it is often ſeene, that children are not anſwerable in loue towardes their parents. And therfore it was neceſſary to admoniſh them by this commandement of their dutie: neither is God contented with a bare commandement, but hath adjoyned a promiſe, and a threatning to make them obſerue it.
               
               
                  S
                  I would gladly know what promiſe and threatning that is.
               
               
                  M
                  Vnto this fourth commandemēt God adjoyneth theſe wordes; that thou maiſt liue long vpon the earth. Meaning that thoſe who honour their father and mother, ſhall haue for rewarde to liue long: and thoſe

who do not honour them, ſhall haue amongſt other puniſhmēts, this particular, not to liue long. And it is a very iuſt puniſhment. For there is no reaſon, thar he enioy long life, who dtſhonoreth thoſe of whom he receiued the ſame life.

                  There occurreth vnto me to demand, whether this, that hath been ſaid of the father & mother, be vnderſtood alſo of other ſuperriors, who towardes vs haue the place of parents?
               
               
                  M
                  It is very wel conſidered of you. For indeed this commandement, is extended vnto al Superiors, as wel Eccleſiaſtical as temporal.
               
            
            
               Of the fifth Commandement.

                  M
                  This commandement chiefly forbiddeth murder, to wit, to kil men. For to kil other liuing things, is not forbidden by this precept And

the reaſon is, becauſe liuing things wen created for man, and therefore where it is needeful that he ſerue himſelf of the life of thoſe liuing creatures, he may kil them: but one man is not created for an other man, but for God, and therefore one man is not maiſter of an other mans life: And ſo it is not lawfull for one man to kill an other.
               
               
                  S
                  Notwithſtāding we ſee that Princes and Gouernours put thieues and other malefactors to death, who neuertheleſſe are men, & it is not holden that they do euil herein, but wel.
               
               
                  M
                  Princes and Gouernours that haue publique authoritie, put malefactors to death, not as maſters of mens liues, but as miniſters of God, as S. Paul ſaith. Becauſe God willeth and commandeth that malefactors be puniſhed & killed, when they deſerue it, that good men may be ſafe, and liue in peace. And for this purpoſe

God hath geuen the ſword into the handes of Princes and Rulers to do iuſtice, in defending the good, and chaſtiſing the bad. And ſo, when by publique authoritie a malefactor is put to death, it is not called murder, but an act of iuſtice: and whereas the commandement of God ſaith: Thou ſhalt not kil, it is vnderſtood, by thy priuat authority.
               
               
                  S
                  I haue heare a doubt, whether this commandement forbiddeth a man to kil him ſelfe, as it forbiddeth to kil an other;
               
               
                  M
                  Without all doubt this commandement forbiddeth to kil himſelfe, becauſe no man is maiſter of his owne life, man being made not by himſelf, but by God. And therefore no man by priuat authoritie can take the life from himſelf. And if any holie men not to loſe their faith, or their chaſtitie, haue killed them ſelues, it is to be thought, that they

had particular, and cleare inſpiration from God to doe it; which otherwiſe could not be excuſed frō moſt grieuous ſinne. For that who killeth himſelfe, killeth a man, and ſo committeth murder, which is a ſin principally forbidden in this fift precept of the lawe.
               
               
                  S
                  Wherfore do you ſay principally?
               
               
                  M
                  Becauſe not only to kill is forbidden, but alſo to hurt, to beat, or to doe anie other injurie whatſoeuer, to the body & perſon of our neighbor. Yea Chriſt our Lord in the holie Goſpell, declaring this commandement, forbiddeth alſo diſdaine, hatred, rancour, reuiling, & other like paſsionat behauiour, and ſpeaches, which vſually are the cauſe & roote of murders. And contrariwiſe, willeth, that we be meeke, and curteous, procuring peace and concord with all men.

                  VVHat is contained in the ſixt commandement?
               
               
                  M
                  The prohibition of adulterie is principally therein cōtained. Which is to ſinne with an other mans wife. And for that, next vnto life, honour (or honeſtie) is moſt eſteemed in this world, therefore next after the commandement, not to kill, with great reaſon adulterie is forbid, by which honeſtie is loſt.
               
               
                  S
                  Wherefore doe you ſay, principally?
               
               
                  M
                  Becauſe in the ten commandements, which are lawes of Iuſtice, thoſe ſinnes are principally forbid, by which injuſtice is more manifeſtly committed, of which ſort is adulterie. But beſides this all other ſortes of carnall ſinnes are alſo ſecondarily forbidden: as ſacriledge, which is to ſinne with a perſon conſecrated to God: inceſt, which is to ſinne with

thoſe of our owne kindred, deflowring, which is to ſinne with a virgin: fornication, which is to ſinne with a woman corrupted and ſingle, as a Widow or a harlot: and other ſortes of ſinnes more abhominable, which ought not ſo much as to be named amongſt Chriſtians.
               
               
                  S
                  Albeit I doe beleeue that all is true, which you haue ſaide, yet I would be glad to vnderſtand, where vpon it is grounded, that fornication is a ſinne: for that he ſeemeth not to do any harme or injurie vnto any, that committeth ſimply fornication.
               
               
                  M
                  It is grounded in all lawes: in the law of Nature, in the written lawe, and in the law of Grace. In the lawe of nature it is found, that the Patriarch Iudas would haue put to death a woman called Thamar, who had bin his ſonnes wife, and being now widdow was founde with childe. Whereby it appeareth, that in that

time, before the Law of Moſes was giuen, by the inſtinct of nature, men did know that fornication was ſinne. After in the lawe of Moſes, fornication is forbidden in many places. And in the Epiſtles of S. Paul, wee reade many times, that fornicators ſhall not enter into the glorie of heauen. Neither is it true, that fornication doth no hurt nor injurie to anie. For it hurteth the ſame woman, who thereby looſeth her fame: it hurteth the childe which is borne a baſtard: it doth injurie to Chriſt, for we being all members of Chriſt, hee that committeth fornication, maketh the member of Chriſt, the member of an harlot. Finally, hee doth injurie to the Holie Ghoſt, for that our bodies are the temple of the Holie Ghoſt, and ſo he that defileth his bodie with fornication, defileth the temple of the Holie Ghoſt.
               
               
                  S
                  Doth this ſixt commandement

forbid any other thing, beſides theſe kinds of ſin, which you haue named
               
               
                  M
                  It forbiddeth alſo al other diſhoneſties, which are as allurements to adultery, or fornication: as laſciuious lookes, vnchaſte kiſsing, and the like. And ſo our Lorde taught vs in in the holie Goſpel, where declaring this ſixt Commandement he ſaith: Whoſoeuer ſhall ſee a woman to luſt after her, hath already committed aduoutrie with her in his heart. And therfore it is neceſſarie to thoſe that will flie from ſuch ſinnes, to haue great care of their outwarde ſenſes, and eſpecially of their eyes, which are as doores whereby death of the ſoule entreth.

                  It containeth the prohibition of theeft, that is, to take the goodes of an other againſte the will of the

owner. And ſo in right order, theft is forbiden, after murder and adulterie. For that amongſt temporal, or worldlie things next to life, honour, (or honeſtie) is eſtemed & then the goodes or riches of this world.

                  M
                  Two waies principally, to which al others are reduced. The firſt way is by taking an others goods ſecretly, and this is properly called theft. The ſecond principal way is by taking an others goods openly, and by force, as robbers do by the highway: and this is called roberie. And albeit the commandement of God ſpeaketh of the firſt, ſaying: Thou ſhalt not ſteale, yet it is vnderſtood alſo of the ſecond: for he that forbiddeth the leſſe euil, without doubt forbiddeth alſo the greater.
               
               
                  S
                  What be the ſinnes which are reduced to theft and roberie, and are

for bid by this commandement.
               
               
                  M
                  They are theſe. Firſt al the frauds & deceipts which are vſed in buying & ſelling, and other like bargaynes. And theſe are reduced to theft: becauſe he that vſeth ſuch deceipts, taketh ſecretly of his neighbours more then is due. Secondly, al vſuries, which are made by lending of money with couenant, that it ſhal be reſtored with ſomething more: And theſe are reduced to roberie, becauſe he that taketh vſurie, exacteth manifeſtly more thē he hathlent. Thirdly, al the damages which are done to our neighbour, though he that is the occaſion thereof, gaine nothing thereby: As when one burneth an other mans houſe. And this is reduced ſometimes to theft, and ſometimes to roberie, according as the harme is done ſecretly or manifeſtly. Fourthly, he that payeth not that he is bouud to pay, ſinneth againſt this

commandement, as much as if hee ſhould ſteale, in that hee keepeth an other mans goods againſt the wil of the owner. Fiftly, he ſinneth againſt the ſame commandement, and committeth theft, that findeth any thing that an other hath loſt, and taketh it for himſelfe: I ſay, that an other hath loſt, becauſe it is not ſinne to take that which belonged to no bodie. As pretious ſtones which ſometimes are found by the ſea ſide. Sixtly, it is reduced to theft or to robberie, whē one appropriateth to himſelfe anie thing which is common. For he that doth appropriate thinges that are common, depriueth the communitie of ſuch things as belong to the whole bodie.
               
               
                  S
                  I deſire to know, if theft be a great ſinne?
               
               
                  M
                  All mortall ſinnes may bee called great, for that they depriue a man of eternall life: but theft hath

this propertie, that it bringeth greateſt euils with it: for we ſee that Iudas by the cuſtome he had to ſteale, appropriating to himſelfe, that was giuen him, for the common vſe of our Lord, and his holie Apoſtles, it brought him in the ende to betray his owne moſt holie Maſter. And we ſee dailie that robbers ſticke not to kill men, whom they neuer did ſee before, and to whom they haue no hatred nor enmitie, onely for dedeſire to take from them, that more or leſſe, which they carry about thē: & God permitteth, that cōmonly thoſe which take frō other men, enjoy it not long: as it fel to Iudas, who hanged himſelf, & al thieues ordinarily fal into the hands of juſtice.

                  M
                  Hitherto hath been ſpoken of injuries, which are committed

againſt our neighbour in deedes, now follow the iniuries which are done by wordes. And therefore the eight commandement forbiddeth falſe witnes, which is the moſt principal iniurie, that is committed with wordes.
               
               
                  S
                  I would know, whether it bee againſt this commandement, when one ſpeaketh that is falſe without harme to any man?
               
               
                  M
                  One may ſpeake that is falſe, three maner of waies. Firſt with damage to our neighbour, as when one accuſeth an other before the iuſtice, that he hath ſtollen or killed, or the like, knowing that it is not true. And this is a wicked and pernitious lie. Secondly, to helpe or excuſe his neighbour, as when one telleth a lie to ſaue an other from ſome danger. And this is called an officious lie. Thirdly, when one telleth a lie, without either harming or helping any

man. And this is called an idle lie. The firſt of all theſe three maners is properly forbidden by this commandement, becauſe it is not onely a falſe teſtimonie, but vniuſt alſo, & a moſt grieuous ſinne. The other two maners, albeit they contain not alwaies iuſtice, and are not ſo grieuous ſinnes, as the firſt, yet they are alwaies ſinnes, at the leaſt venial. For that a lie ought not to bee tolde for any thing in the world.

                  It containeth the prohibition of three other ſinnes, which are committed by the tongue, and in ſome ſorte are reduced to falſe witneſſe: which are, Contumelie, Detraction, and Curſing.

                  A Contumelie is an iniurious worde, ſpoken to the diſhonour or

diſcredite our neighbour. As if one ſaye to an other, that he is ignorant or of litle wit, baſe, infamous, or the like. And that this is a great ſinne, being ſpoken with an injurious meaning: our Sauiour declareth in the holy Goſpel, where he ſaith, that he that calleth his brother foole, ſhal be guiltie of hel fire. I ſaid when it is ſpoken with an injurious minde: for when it is ſpoken in ieſt, or to admoniſh, or correct, as ſometimes a father ſpeaketh to his childe, or a maſter to his Scholar, without meaning to iniurie him, then it is not cō
                     tumely, nor any ſin, for moſt parte, but ſometimes it may be a venial ſin.

                  M
                  Detraction is to take away the fame of our neighbour in ſpeaking euill of him. And this i
                        •
                      done either by ſpeaking ill falſly, or by telling ſome euill that is true, but was ſecrete. Whereby our neighbour looſeth

the good-name which he had with them, who did not know his ſinne before. And this detraction is a very frequent ſinne amongſt men, and very grieuous and dangerous, becauſe a mans name is more worth then his goods, and by ſome it is more eſteemed then life it ſelfe. And therefore it is a great wrong to make them looſe it. And whereas it is an eaſie thing to find remedie for other loſſes, a good name when it is loſt, is not recouered without great difficultie. And beſides all this, hee that by his detraction hath taken it away is bound to reſtore it. Wherefore, it is a moſt profitable counſel, to ſpeake well alwaies of all men, when it can be done with truth, and when it can not, then be ſilent.

                  M
                  Malediction or curſing is, when one curſeth his neighbour, as by ſaying, curſed be he, or by vttering,

other ſorts of maledictions againſt him, as ſaying, ſuch an euil, or ſuch an one take thee. And this curſing is a moſt grieuous ſin, when it is ſpoken with hatred & with deſire that ſuch euils come vnto his neighbour in earneſte. But when it is done, without hatred or euill deſire, as in ieaſt, or to make ſporte, or vppon ſome ſuddaine diſdaine, without regarde to that hee ſpeaketh, it is leſſe euill; yet it is for all that, alwaies euill, for that from the mouth of a Chriſtian, who is the ſonne of God by adoption, nothing ought to paſſe but benediction.

                  M
                  It contayneth the prohibition of the deſire to haue thy neighbours wife. For that albeit in the

ſixt Commandement adulterie is forbidden: yet God would ſeueerely forbid the deſire of adulterie, to giue vs to vnderſtād, that theſe two are diuerſe ſinnes.
               
               
                  S
                  It ſeemeth that in this Commandemēt the deſire of adulterie, which a woman committeth with the huſband of an other woman is not forbidden, but only the deſire of adulterie, which a man committeth with the wife of an other man, ſeeing it is ſaid, thou ſhalt not deſire thy neighbours wife.
               
               
                  M
                  It is not ſo. But the deſire of adulterie is forbidden, aſwel of a woman, as of a man: for albeit it is ſaid, thou ſhalt not deſire thy neighbours wife: yet that is ſpoken vnto the man, is vnderſtood to be ſpoken alſo to the woman: becauſe in the man as more notable, is contained alſo the womā. And beſids euery one knoweth that the adulterie of a woman, is more

infamous, at leaſte in the ſight of the worlde then of a man: as the honeſtie & ſhamefaſtnes, is alſo more commended in a woman, then in a man. Seeing then it is forbidden to a man to deſire an other mans wife, without doubt it is alſo forbidden to a woman to deſire an other womans husband.
               
               
                  S
                  You haue ſaide before, that where adulterie is forbidden, all other carnall ſinnes are alſo forbidden. I deſire to knowe whether the ſame bee vnderſtood of the deſire.
               
               
                  M
                  There is no doubt at all but that when the deſire of adulterie is forbidden, the deſire alſo of fornication and of all other diſhoneſties, is vnderſtood to bee forbidden, for that the ſame reaſon is of all theſe ſinnes.
               
               
                  S
                  I would know whether euery deſire of an other mans wife be ſinne, although there be no conſent of the will to ſuch a deſire?
               
               
                  
                  M
                  S. Gregory the Pope hath taugth vs, that in an euill deſire there are three degrees. The firſt is called ſuggeſtion; the ſecond delectation; the third conſent. Suggeſtion is when the diuell putteth into the minde a diſhoneſt thought, which is accompanied with a ſuddaine beginning of euill deſire: and if to this ſuggeſtion, there be reſiſtance made preſently, ſo that it come to no delight, a man doth not ſin, but merite before God: but if the ſuggeſtion paſſe to a ſenſuall delectation, and there bee no conſent of reaſon and will, then a man is not without ſome veniall ſinne: but if to the ſuggeſtion and delectation, the conſent of reaſon and will be annexed, ſo that a man perceiue it and deſire it, and willingly remaine in ſuch a deſire & thought, it is a mortall ſinne, and this is that which is properly forbidden in this commandement.
               
            
            
               
               Of the tenth Commandement.
               
                  S
                  VVHAT doth the tenth Commandement contayne?
               
               
                  M
                  It contayneth the prohibition of the deſire of an other mans goods, aſwell immooueable, as are his houſe and landes, as mooueable, ſuch as money, cattle, fruits, & other things And ſo is perfect iuſtice fulfilled, when we doe injurie to our neighbour, neither in worke nor in worde, nor ſo much as in thought & deſire.
               
               
                  S
                  I do maruel that God hauing forbidden murder, adulterie, and theft, he doth not forbid the deſire of murder, as he forbiddeth the deſire of adulterie, and theft.
               
               
                  M
                  The reaſon is this, becauſe a man doeth not deſire principally any thing, but that which bringeth him ſome good, at the leaſt in apparance. And ſo hee deſireth adulterie, becauſe it bringeth delight he deſireth

theft, for that it bringeth profite: murder bringeth no good at all, & therefore it is not deſired for it ſelfe, but only to attaine to adulterie, or to theft, or to ſome other his deſignements: for this cauſe, though the deſire of murder, be a moſt grieuous ſin, yet God did not forbid it particularly: for that it might be vnderſtood as forbidden, when murder it ſelfe was forbidden. Beſides, hauing ſhut the doores to diſordinat deſires of delectation, and of commodities, conſequently were ſhut vp alſo the deſires of murder, which for moſt part is not deſired, but to attayne to ſome commoditie, or delight.
               
               
                  S
                  I would know, for what cauſe the deſire is neuer prohibited by humaine lawes, as we ſee it is forbidden in this law of God.
               
               
                  M
                  The reaſon is manifeſt, for that men, although they bee Popes, or Emperours, do not ſee the harts, but

onely the exteriour things, & therefore being not able to iudge the thoughts and deſires, much leſſe can they puniſh them, and ſo it is not conuenient they ſhould buſie themſelues in forbidding them. But God that diſcerneth the harts of all men, can puniſhe the euill thoughts and deſires: and therefore he forbiddeth them in his holie law.

               S
               BESIDES the Commandements of God, I would know if there bee any other to bee obſerued.

               There are the precepts of Holie Church, which are theſe.
               
                  
                     
                        1 To be preſent at Maſſe on commanded feaſts.

               S
               I Deſire to know, if beſides the commandements of our Lord, there be any counſels alſo of his, to liue more perfectly.
            
            
               M
               There are many moſt holy counſels and moſt profitable to obſerue the commandements with more perfection: But there are three moſt principall; voluntary pouertie, chaſtitie, and obedience.
            
            
               S
               Wherein conſiſteth the counſell of pouertie.
            
            
               M
               In not hauing any thing proper, all his goodes being giuen to the poore, or put into the common, which likewiſe hath giuen all to the poore. And this counſell Chriſte taught, not onely in wordes: but alſo by his example. And after Chriſt, the holy Apoſtles followed it, as alſo all the firſt Chriſtians, who dwelled in Ieruſalem, in the time of the Primatiue

Church: and finally al religious perſons make vow to obſerue this holie counſaile of voluntarie pouertie.
            
            
               S
               Wherein conſiſteth the counſaile of chaſtitie?
            
            
               M
               In a reſolution to be perpetually chaſt, not only abſtayning from all ſortes of carnal ſinnes, but alſo from Mariage. And this coūſaile alſo our Lord taught by word and example. And our Ladie likewiſe obſerued the ſame, S. Iohn Baptiſt, al the Apoſtles, after they were called by Chriſt to the Apoſtleſhip. And al religious perſons make particular vow hereof as alſo al Eccleſiaſtical men, that take holie Orders.
            
            
               S
               Where in conſiſteth the counſaile of obedience;
            
            
               M
               In renouncing our proper iudgment, and proper wil, which in the holie Goſpel is called, denying of a mans ſelfe, and to ſubiect him ſelfe

to the wil of his ſuperior, in al things that be not againſt God. And this counſaile likewiſe the Sauiour of the world, taught not only in word, but alſo by his example, obeying in all thinges his eternall Father, and ſubmitting himſelf when he was a child to his mother, and to S. Ioſeph his ſuppoſed Father, the ſpouſe of our B. Lady, albeit indeede he was not his Father, being borne of a mother, who was alwaies a Virgin. And this is the third counſaile, to the vvhich all religious perſons bind themſelues by vowe.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore are there three principall counſailes, and no moe?
            
            
               M
               Becauſe theſe principall counſailes ſerue to take away the impediments of perfection: that conſiſteth in charity, for the impediments are three, to witte, the loue of goods, which is taken away by pouerty: the loue of carnall pleaſures, which is

taken away by chaſtitie: & the loue of honour and power which is taken away by obedience. Moreouer, becauſe a man hath but three ſorts of goods; to wit, a ſoule, a body, and his exterior wealth, therefore giuing the exterior goods to God by pouertie, his bodie by chaſtitie, and his ſoule by obedience, he maketh a Sacrifice vnto God of all that he hath, and ſo diſpoſeth himſelfe to perfection of charitie, in the beſt maner that in this life is poſsible.
            
         
         
            Chap. IX. The declaration of the Sacraments of holie Church.
            
               S
               I HAVE learned through the grace of our Lorde, the three principal parts of Chriſtiā doctrine, it remaineth that you declare vnto me the fourth, which, if I well remember, contayneth the ſeauen Sacraments of the Church?
            
            
               M
               This part of doctrine is alſo very profitable, & therefore it is conueent

that you learne it with great diligence. You muſt then know, that in the holie Church there is a great treaſure, to wit theſe holie Sacraments, by meanes whereof, we receiue the grace of God, we keepe it, we increaſe it, and when by our defalt wee loſe it, wee may recouer it again. I wil therfore declare vnto you what a ſacrament is, how many Sacraments there bee, by whom they were inſtituted, and ſome other fewe things: and after we will come to the declaration of euerie one of them in particular.
            
            
               S.
               Begin then I pray you, to declare what a Sacrament is, which I much deſire to vnderſtand.
            
            
               M.
               A Sacrament is a holy Myſtery, by which God beſtoweth his grace, and with all it repreſenteth exteriorly the inuiſible effect, which grace worketh in our ſoule. For if wee were ſpirits without bodies, as the Angels

are, God would giue vs his grace ſpiritually: but becauſe we are compoſed of a ſoule and a bodie, therefore our Lord condeſcending to our nature, geueth vs his grace by means of certayn corporal actions, which as I haue ſaid, together with certain exterior ſignes declare to vs the inward effect of grace. As for example holie Baptiſme, which is one of the Sacraments, is done by waſhing the bodie with water, and therwith calling vpon the moſt holie Trinitie. By means of which ceremonious waſhing, God geueth his grace, & putteth it in the ſoule of him, that is baptiſed. And it inſtructeth vs, that as that water waſheth the bodie, ſo grace waſheth the ſoule & clenſeth it from al ſinne.
            
            
               S
               If I haue wel vnderſtood, three conditions are requiſit to the nature of a Sacrament: firſt, that it be a ceremonie, or as we would ſay, an

exterior action: the ſecond, that God by it giue his grace: the third, that the ſame ceremonie haue a ſimilitude with the effect of grace, and ſo repreſent and ſignifie it exteriorly.
            
            
               M
               You haue vnderſtood it very wel. Now you haue to know further, that theſe Sacraments are in al ſeauen, & are called Baptiſme, Confirmation or Chriſme, Euchariſt, Penance, Extreame Vnction, Order, and Matrimonie. The reaſon wherfore they are ſeauen is this: for that God would proceed in giuing vs ſpiritual life, as he vſeth to proceed in giuing vs our corporal life. Touching corporal life, firſt is needful to be borne, ſecondly, is needfull to grow, thirdly, is needfull to be nouriſhed: fourthly when a man falleth ſicke, it is needful he vſe phiſicke: ſiftly, when he muſt fight, he hath need to arme himſelfe: ſixtly is needfull, that there bee ſome to gouerne and rule thoſe that are now

borne & growne; ſeuenthly, is needfull there be ſome to multiplie mankind: for ſeeing thoſe that are borne do die, if others ſhould not ſucceed, mankinde would ſoone decay. So then touching the ſpiritual life, firſt it is needfull that Gods grace bee borne in vs, & this is done by baptiſme: ſecondly, it is needfull that the ſame grace increaſe and bee made ſtrong: & this is done by Confirmation: thirdly, is needful, that it be noriſhed and maintained, & this doth the Euchariſt worke: fourthly, is needfull that it be recouered, whenit is loſt, and this is done be the medicine of Penance. Fiftly, is needfull that at the poynt of death, a man arme himſelfe againſt the infernal enimy, who then, more thē euer aſſalteth vs, & this doth extreme Vnctiō worke: Sixtly, is neceſſary that there be in the church ſuch as may guid & gouerne vs in ſpiritual life, & this is

done by Orders. Seuenthly, is needfull that there bee in the Church, ſuch as do multiplie mankinde, and the number of the faithfull thereby, and this is done by the Sacrament of Matrimonie.
            
            
               S
               Who found out, and inſtituted ſo marueilous things?
            
            
               M
               Theſe Sacraments being ſo admirable, could not be deuiſed otherwiſe then by diuine wiſdome, nor inſtituted by any other then by God, who can giue vs grace: and ſo Chriſt our Lorde, who is God and man, deuiſed and inſtituted them. Moreouer all the Sacraments are as certaine condicts, by which the vertue of Chriſts Paſsion is deriued vnto vs. And ſure it is, that none can beſtow the treaſure of Chriſts paſsion, but in that maner and by thoſe meanes, which chriſt hath ordained.
            
            
               S
               I would gladly know if in the time of the old Teſtament, there were Sacraments,

and if they were ſo excellent as ours?
            
            
               M
               There were many Sacraments in the olde Teſtament, but they were different from ours in foure things. Firſt, thoſe were moe in number thē ours, and therefore the old law was harder then the new law. Secondly, thoſe were not ſo eaſie to be obſerued as ours are. Thirdly, thoſe were more obſcure, whereby fewe vnderſtood what they ſignifyed: whereas ours haue ſo cleere ſignifycation, that euery one may vnderſtande them. Fourthly, thoſe did not giue grace, which ours do: but did onely figuratiuely foreſhew and promiſe it. So that our Sacraments are much more excellent: being fewer, more eaſie, more cleere, and more effectuall, then thoſe were.
            
            
               S
               I would alſo know, which amongſt our ſeauen Sacraments is the greateſt of all?
            
            
               
               M
               They are al great, & euerie one of them hath ſome peculiar greatnes. The greateſt of al is the moſt holie Sacrament of the Euchariſt, for in it is contained the Author of grace, and of al goodnes which is Chriſt our Lord, yet touching the neceſsitie, the moſt neceſſarie of all are Baptiſme & Penance. In reſpect of the dignitie of thoſe that can miniſter the Sacramentes: the more worthie are Confirmatiō, & Order, becauſe theſe two Sacraments, can not be geuen ordinarily, but by a Biſhop. In reſpect of the facilitie, the moſt eaſie is Extreme Vnction, becauſe by it ſinnes are remitted with out trouble of penance: touching the ſignification, Matrimonie is the greateſt, becauſe it ſignifieth the vnion of Chriſt with the Church.
            
            
               Of Baptiſme.
               
                  S
                  BEgin, if you pleaſe, to declare the firſt Sacrament: and firſt

tel me wherefore is it called Baptiſme?
               
               
                  M
                  This name of baptiſme is a greek word, and it ſignifieth waſhing, but holie Church vſeth this greeke word becauſe the word waſhing is to cō
                     mon, and is vſed euerie day in common thinges. And therefore to the end this Sacrament ſhould haue a proper name, and ſhould be the better knowen, and honored, it is called Baptiſme.
               
               
                  S
                  What things are neceſſarie to the Sacrament of Baptiſme?
               
               
                  M
                  Three things at the leaſt are neceſſarie, & learne them wel, becauſe in certaine caſes of neceſsitie, as wee ſhal ſay hereafter, euerie one may baptiſe: and therefore it is good that euerie one know how to do it. Firſt is required true and naturall water, which muſt be applied to the partie that is Baptiſed: Secondly, at the ſame time when the water is vſed,

theſe wordes muſt be ſpoken: I Baptiſe thee in the name of the Father, & of the Sonne, and of the Holie Ghoſt. Thirdly, it is neceſſarie, that the perſon that baptiſeth haue intention to baptiſe, that is, to giue the Sacrament which Chriſt hath inſtituted, and which Holie Church vſeth to giue, when ſhee baptiſeth. For if one had intention only to ieſt, or to waſh only the body of ſome foulenes, hee ſhould ſinne moſt grieuouſly, and it were no baptiſme, and ſo the poore ſoule were not baptiſed.
               
               
                  S
                  What effect worketh Baptiſme?
               
               
                  M
                  It worketh three effects. Firſt it reneweth a man perfectly, giuing him the grace of God, by which, being before the childe of the diuel, he becommeth the childe of God, and of a ſinner becommeth iuſt; and it doth not only waſh the ſoule from all ſpot of ſinne, but it deliuereth it alſo from all the paines of Hell, and of

Purgatorie. In ſo much, that if one ſhould die immediatly after Baptiſme, hee ſhould goe directly into Heauen, as if he had neuer committed ſin. Secondly, Baptiſme leaueth in the ſoule a certain ſpiritual marke which cannot by any meanes be taken away, by which it ſhall for euer be knowne, yea alſo in thoſe which goe to Hell, that they receiued Baptiſme, and that they had been of the ſheepe of Chriſt. As by the peculiar marks it is knowne in this world, to whom ſlaues or cattle do belong. And this is the cauſe why Baptiſme can not bee taken oftner then once: for it is neuer loſt, this effect thereof remayning for euer printed in the ſoule. Thirdly, by Baptiſme a man entreth into the Church, and is partaker of all the benefits thereof, as a childe of holie Church, and maketh profeſsion to bee a Chriſtian, and to be readie to obey thoſe that in place

of Chriſt gouerne the Church.
               
               
                  S
                  To whom doth it belong properly to giue Baptiſme?
               
               
                  M
                  It belongeth to a Prieſt by proper office, and chiefely to thoſe who haue charge of ſoules. But when a Prieſt can not be had, it belongeth to a Deacon, and in caſe of neceſsitie, to wit, when there is danger that the partie ſhould die without Baptiſme, it belongeth to euery one, aſwell Prieſt as Lay-man, as well man as woman: but alwaies order is to be obſerued, that a woman baptiſe not, if a man may be had; and that a Lay man baptiſe not, if any Eccleſiaſtical perſon be preſent; and amongſt Eccleſiaſticall, alwaies the leſſe muſt giue place to the greater.
               
               
                  S
                  I maruell that Baptiſme is giuen to litle children ſcarce borne, who do not know what they take.
               
               
                  M
                  The neceſsitie of Baptiſme is ſo great, that who dyeth without it, or

at the leaſt, without deſiring it, can not enter into heauen: and becauſe litle infants, are in great danger to die eaſely, and can not at that age haue any ſuch deſire of Baptiſme; it is therefore neceſſarie to baptiſe thē with all ſpeede that may be. And although they knowe not what they take, the Church ſupplyeth the defect which by the godfather & godmother anſwereth and promiſeth for them, and this ſufficeth: becauſe as by the meanes of Adam wee are fallen into ſin, and into the offence of God, not knowing any thing: ſo God is contented, that by meanes of Baptiſme, and of the Church, we bee deliuered from ſinne, and turne into his grace, yea though we know nothing thereof.

                  What meaneth godfather and godmother of whom you ſpoke, and what is their office?
               
               
                  M
                  To the adminiſtration of Baptiſme,

by ancient cuſtome of the Church, concurreth a man who is called a godfather, and alſo a woman, who is called a godmother, that is, an other father and mother in things pertayning to God. And theſe two, or on of them holdeth the child, whiles it is chriſtned, and anſwereth for it, when the Prieſt demādeth of the child, if it wil be baptiſed, and if it beleue the Articles of the faith, and other ſuch like things. And after when the child groweth in yeares, the godfather and godmother are bound, to haue care to inſtruct it, in matters, of faith, and in good maners, if the father and mother be herein negligent. And moreouer it is to be noted, that by Baptiſme they become alyed by a ſpiritual affinitie, to the partie that is baptiſed, and to his father and mother, as wel he that baptiſeth, as the godfather and godmother.
               
            
            
               
               Of the Sacrament of Confirmation.
               
                  S
                  VVE haue ſpoken ſufficiently of Baptiſme, tel me now, I pray you, what meaneth confirmation or Chriſme, which is the ſecond Sacrament.
               
               
                  M
                  The ſecond Sacrament is called Confirmation, becauſe the effect therof is to confirme the baptiſed in faith, as we ſhal ſay by and by. It is alſo called Chriſme which is a greeke word, and ſignifieth vnction, becauſe in this Sacrament, the forehead of the perſon that receiueth this Sacrament, is anointed with holie Chriſme. For as in Baptiſme the baptiſed is waſhed with water, to ſignifie that the grace of God waſheth his ſoule from all ſpot of ſinnes: ſo in Chriſme the forehead is anointed, to ſignifie that the grace of God anoynteth the ſoule, & ſo comforteth and fortifieth it, that it may fight againſt the diuel, and confeſſe

boldly the holy faith, without feare of torments, or of death it ſelfe.
               
               
                  S
                  In what time ought this Sacrament to be receiued?
               
               
                  M
                  It ought to bee receiued, when the childe is come to vſe of reaſon, becauſe then hee beginneth to confeſſe his faith, and hath need to bee confirmed and eſtabliſhed in the grace of God.
               
               
                  S
                  Doth this Sacrament worke any thing elſe, beſides the fortifying of the ſoule?
               
               
                  M
                  It leaueth a caracter or marke fixed and printed in the ſoule, which neuer can bee ſcraped out: & therefore this Sacrament can not bee receiued oftner then once.
               
               
                  S
                  What neede is there to imprint in the ſoule any other marke, ſeing that of baptiſme may ſuffice?
               
               
                  M
                  This ſecond caractar or marke is not imprinted without cauſe. For that by the firſt, a mā is only knowen

to be a Chriſtian, that is of the familie of Chriſt: but by this ſecond, it is knowne, that he is a ſouldier of chriſt and therefore he carrieth in his ſoule the armes of his captaine, as in the world, ſouldiers carrie them on their garments, & whoſoeuer receiue this Sacrament, and goe into hell, ſhall haue the greater confuſion, for that euery one ſhall ſee, that they made profeſsiō of the ſouldiers of chriſt, & are after ſo fowly reuolted from him.

                  MAY it pleaſe you declare to me nowe the third Sacrament: & firſt tel me what meaneth this word Euchariſt?
               
               
                  M
                  This is a greeke word alſo, & it ſignifyeth, gratefull memorie, or thankſ giuing. For in this Sacramēt, memorie is made, & thanks are giuen to God, for the moſt excellent benefite, of the holy Paſsion of our Sauiour, and withall there is giuen

the true bodie & bloud of our Lord, for which wee are bound to render perpetuall thanks to God.
               
               
                  S
                  Declare to me more fullie all that is contained in this holy Sacrament, that knowing the greatnes thereof, I may the better honour it.
               
               
                  M
                  The Hoaſt which you ſee vpon the Altar, before it be conſecrated, is nothing elſe but a litle bread, made in forme of a thin Wáfer cake: but immediatly, when the Prieſt hath pronounced the conſecration, there is preſent in the Hoaſt the true bodie of our Lord: and becauſe the true bodie of our Lord is liuing, and vnited to the Diuinitie, in the perſon of the Sonne of God, therefore together with the bodie is the blood alſo, and the ſoule, and the Deitie, and ſo whole Chriſt, God and man. In the ſame maner in the Chalice, before the conſecration, there is nothing elſe but a litle wine with a litle

water, but ſuddenly the conſecration being ended, there is the true blood of Chriſt: and becauſe the blood of Chriſt is not forth of his bodie, therefore in the Chalice, together with the blood, are the body, the ſoule, and the Deitie of the ſame Chriſt, and ſo whole Chriſt, God, man.
               
               
                  S
                  I doe yet ſee, that the Hoaſt after the conſecration, hath the figure of bread as before, and that which is in the Chalice, the figure of Wine, as before.
               
               
                  M
                  So it is, that in the Hoaſt there remaineth the figure and alſo the colour, and the taſte of bread, which was there before, but not the ſubſtance of bread, which was before. And ſo vnder the forme of bread, there is not bread, but the bodie of our Lorde. And the better to vnderſtand this, I wil giue you an example You haue heard that Lots wife was

conuerted into a ſtatute of ſalt: thoſe that ſaw the ſtatute, did ſee the figure of Lot his wife, which then was not any more Lots wife but vnder the figure of a woman was ſalt. As there fore in that conuerſion, the inward ſubſtance was changed, & the outward ſhape remayned: ſo in this Myſterie, the inward ſubſtance is changed from bread into the bodie of our Lord, the outward figure of bread remaining, which was there before. The ſame alſo you are to vnderſtand of the Chalice, that is, that there is the figure, the taſte, the colour & the ſmel of wine: yet is there not the ſubſtance of wine, but the blood of our Lord, vnder that forme of wine.
               
               
                  S
                  It ſeemeth to me a great thing that a great body, as that of our lord, can be vnder ſo litle a forme as that of the conſecrated Hoaſt.
               
               
                  M
                  It is certainely a great thinge,

but the power of God is alſo great who can do greater things then we can vnderſtand: and ſo Chriſt when he ſaid, in the holie goſpel, that God could make a camel, which is a beaſt bigger thē a horſe, to paſſe through the eye of a nedle, he added, that with mē theſe things are impoſsible; but with God al things are poſſible.
               
               
                  S
                  I would be glad to haue ſome example, how the ſame bodie of our Lord, can be in ſo manie hoſtes as are in ſo many Altars.
               
               
                  M
                  It is not needfull to vnderſtand the wonders of God, but it ſufficeth to beleue them, ſeeing we are certain that God cānot deceiue vs. Yet I wil giue you an example for your conſolation. It is ſure that our ſoule is but one & is whole in al the members of the body, al wholly in the head, al in the feet, yea whole in euery litle part of our bodie; what marueill is it then, that God can make the body of

his Sonne to be in many Hoaſts, ſeeing one and the ſame ſoule to bee whole & intire, in ſo many & ſo diuers and diſtinct parts of the bodie? It is read in the life of S. Anthonie of Padua, that the ſame time hee was Preaching in a citie of Italie, he was alſo by Gods power in Portugal, to do ſome other good works. And if God could make Saint Anthonie, to be in two places at one time, ſo farre diſtant, & that in his proper forme, wherefore can he not make that Chriſt be preſent in manie Hoaſts, vnder the forme of the ſame Hoaſt?
               
               
                  S
                  Tel me, I pray you, if Chriſt depart from Heauen when he commeth into the Hoaſts, or remaineth he ſtil in Heauen?
               
               
                  M
                  When our Lord beginneth to be preſent in the holie Hoaſt, he departeth not from heauen, but by diuine power, hee is both preſent in Heauen and in the Hoaſt. Take the

example of our ſoule: when one is a childe of few daies old, and very little as you ſee; and being meaſured, is founde to bee but one Palme in length, after increaſing, he becommeth double ſo bigge as he was before; and ſo being meaſured, he is aboue two Palmes. Now I demande of you, if the ſoule which was firſt in one palme only, hath left that palme to come into the ſecond or no? Sure it is that it hath not left it, neither is it inlarged, becauſe it is inuiſible, ſo that without leauing the firſt, it commeth alſo into the ſecond: euen ſo our Lord leaueth not heauen to come into the Hoaſt, neither leaueth the one Hoaſt to be in an other, but he is preſent in Heauen & in all the Hoaſtes at once.
               
               
                  S
                  Now I haue learned that which is contained in this moſt holy Sacrament: I deſire to know what things are requiſite to receiue it worthely?
               
               
                  
                  M
                  Three things are requuired, the firſt is, that the partie doe confeſſe himſelfe of all his ſinnes, & procure that he be in the grace of God, when hee goeth to communicate, for that one of the cauſes, wherefore this Sacrament is giuen to vs, vnder the forme of bread, is to the end we vnderſtand, that it is giuen to liuing men, & not to dead-men, to nouriſh the grace of God, and to increaſe it. The ſecond thing is, that wee be altogether faſting, that is, at the leaſt from midnight forward we haue taken nothing: no not ſomuch as a litle water. The third, that we wel vnderſtand what we do, and that we haue deuotiō vnto ſo great a myſterie: & therfore this ſacrament is not giuen to children, neither to fooles, neither to any other that hath not the vſe of reaſon.
               
               
                  S
                  How oftē ought we to cōmunicat?
               
               
                  M
                  The bond of holy Church is to

communicate at leaſt once a yeare, & that at Eaſter. Yet it is conuenient to do it oftner, ſo it be by the aduice of our ghoſtly father.
               
               
                  S
                  Declare now vnto mee, the fruite which is gotten by this Sacrament, and the ende for which it was inſtituted.
               
               
                  M
                  For three cauſes: Chriſt our Lord hath inſtituted this moſt noble Sacrament. Firſt, that it ſhould be the meate of ſoules: ſecondly, that it ſhould be a ſacrifice of the new law: thirdly, that it might be a perpetuall memorie of his Paſsion, and ſo a moſt deare pledge of his loue towards vs.
               
               
                  S
                  What effect doth it worke in reſpect it is the meate of ſoules?
               
               
                  M
                  It worketh that effect which corporall meate worketh in bodies, & therfore it is giuen to vs in forme of bread: for like as bread conſerueth naturall heate, wherein the life

of the bodie conſiſteth: ſo this moſt holie Sacrament, when it is worthely receiued conſerueth and increaſeth charitie, which is the life and health of the ſoule.
               
               
                  S
                  What effect doth it worke as it is a Sacrifice?
               
               
                  M
                  It reconſileth God vnto the world, & obteyneth manie benifits, not only for the liuing, but alſo for the dead, that are in purgatorie. You muſt vnderſtand that in the old Teſtament they offered vnto God manie Sacrifices of beaſtes, but in the new Teſtament in place of al thoſe Sacrifices, is ſucceeded the Maſſe, in which by the hands of the Prieſt is offered vnto God, the moſt acceptable Sacrifice of the bodie and bloud of his Sonne, which was ſignified in al thoſe ſacrifices of the old Teſtament.
               
               
                  S
                  What effect worketh it, as the memorial and pledge of the loue of

our Lord towards vs?
               
               
                  M
                  It maketh vs mindful of ſo great a benifite, and in flameth vs to loue him againe, that hath loued vs ſo much. And therefore like as God in the old Teſtament, would haue the Iewes not only to eate Manna, which he ſent them from Heauen, but alſo haue them keep one veſſel ful of the ſame, in memorie of all the benefits he ſhewed them, when he brought them out of Egipt: ſo Chriſt would that this moſt holie Sacrament, ſhould not only be eaten by vs, but alſo that it be conſerued on the Altar, and ſometimes carried in Proceſsion, that when ſoeuer we ſee it, we may remember his infinite goodnes towards vs. But in particular the holie Maſſe is a briefe repreſentation of the whole life of our lord, that the ſame may ſtil remaine in our mindes.
               
               
                  S
                  I would know how the Maſſe is a

repreſentation of the life of Chriſt, that thereby I may become more deuout and attentiue, when I am preſent thereat.
               
               
                  M
                  I wil declare it briefly. The Introitus (or beginning) of the Maſſe, doth ſignifie the deſire which the holie Fathers had of the comming of our Lord. The Keyrieleiſon ſignifieth the voice of the ſame Patriarches and Prophets, demanding of God, this comming of chriſt, ſo long deſired. Gloria in excelſis, ſignifieth the Natiuitie of our Lord. The prayers next following, ſignifie his preſentation & offering in the Temple. The Epiſtle, which is reade at the lift end of the Altar, ſignifieth the preaching of S. Iohn Baptiſt. Who inuited al men to Chriſt. The Gradual ſignifieth the conuerſion of the people by the preaching of S. Iohn. The goſpel, which is read at the right end of the altar, ſignifieth the preaching

of our Lord, which bringeth vs from the left hand vnto the right: that is, from temporal things to eternall, & from ſinne to grace: lights alſo are carried, & incenſe burned to ſignifie that the holie Goſpel hath lightened the world, & filled it with the good ſauors of the glorie of God. The Crede ſignifieth the firſt conuerſion of the holie Apoſtles, and other Diſciples of our Lord. The ſecret prayers after the Creede ſignifie the ſecret practiſes of the Iewes againſt Chriſt. The Preface, which is ſongue with a lowd voice, and endeth with Oſanna in excelſis, ſignifieth the ſolemne enterance which Chriſt made into Ieruſalem on Palme-ſunday. The Canon ſignifieth the Paſſion of our Lord. The eleuation of the holie Hoaſte and Chalice, repreſenteth to vs, that Chriſt was eleuated vpon the Croſſe. The Pater noſter, ſignifieth, the praier of our Lord

whiles he did hang on the Croſſe: the breaking of the Hoaſt ſignifieth the wound made by the ſpeare percing his ſide. The Agnus Dei, ſignifieth the lamentation of the Maries, at the taking downe of Chriſt from the Croſſe. The communion of the Prieſt, ſignifieth the burial of Chriſt. The Poſt-communion ſong with ioy, ſignifieth the Reſurrectiō. Ite miſſa eſt, ſignifieth the Aſcēſion. The benediction of the Prieſt ſignifieth the comming of the Holie Ghoſt. The Goſpel at the end of Maſſe, ſignifieth the preaching of the holie Apoſtles, when being filled with the holie Ghoſt, they began to preach the Goſpel through the whole world, and ſo begane the conuerſion of the Gentils.
               
            
            
               Of the Sacrament of Penance.
               
                  S
                  THERE followeth nowe the fourth Sacrament, which is called Penance: declare therefore, I

pray you, what this Sacrament is?
               
               
                  M
                  Penance ſignifieth three things. Firſt it ſignifieth a certaine vertue by which a man repenteth himſelfe of his ſinnes, and the contrarie vice is called impenitence, to wit, when a man wil not repent, but wil perſeuer in ſinne. Secondly we cal penance the paine & affliction, which a man taketh to ſatisfie to God, for the euil he hath done, And ſo we ſay that one doth great penance, becauſe he afflicteth himſelfe much, with faſtings and other auſteritie. Thirdly penance ſignifieth a Sacrament, inſtituted by Chriſt to remit ſinnes of thoſe, who after Baptiſme haue loſt the grace of God, and do againe repent the ſame, and deſire to returne into his fauour.
               
               
                  S
                  Wherein doth this Sacrament principally conſiſt?
               
               
                  M
                  In two things: in the confeſſion of the ſinner, and the abſolution of

the Prieſt. For that chriſt hath made the Prieſt judges of ſinnes committed after Baptiſme, and giuen them authoritie in his place, to remitte them, ſo the ſinner confeſſe them, and bee otherwiſe diſpoſed as hee ought to be. So in this conſiſteth the Sacrament, that like as the ſinner confeſſeth his ſinnes exteriorly, and the Prieſt exteriorly pronounceth abſolution: ſo God inwardly by meanes of thoſe words of the Prieſt, looſeth that ſoule from the band of ſinne, with which it was tyed, and reſtored it to grace, and deliuereth it from that it had deſerued, to haue been caſt head-long into hell.
               
               
                  S
                  What is neceſsarie for the receiuing of this Sacrament?
               
               
                  M
                  Three things are neceſſary, Contrition, Confeſsion, and Satisfaction; Which are three parts of Penance.
               
               
                  S
                  What meaneth Contrition?
               
               
                  
                  M
                  That the hard-hart of the ſinner become ſoft, and in a certaine manner, breake it ſelfe with ſorrowe, for that it hath offended God. But in particular, Contrition contayneth two things, & the one ſufficeth not without the other. Firſt, that the ſinner be earneſtly ſorie for all his ſins committed after Baptiſme: & therefore it is neceſſarie to examine well, and to conſider all his actions, and to be ſorrowfull, that he hath not done them according to the law of God. Secondly that the ſinner haue firme purpoſe to ſinne no more.
               
               
                  S
                  What meaneth confeſsion?

                  The ſinner muſt not be content with only contrition, but he muſt go to the feet of the Prieſt, as Magdalen went vnto the feete of Chriſt, and confeſſe his ſins with truth, not adding nor diminiſhing, nor mixing any lye; with ſimplicitie, not excuſing himſelf, nor laying the fault on

others, neither multiplying ſuperfluous words, with integritie, vttering them all, not leauing any thing for ſhamfaſtnes, & telling the number of euery ſorte, and the circumſtances which any way do agrauate the ſinne, ſo far as he can remember. Finally with ſhamefaſtneſſe and humilitie, not recounting his ſinnes, as if he tolde an hiſtorie, but telling them as thinges deſeruing ſhame, and vnworthie of a Chriſtian, and humbly deſiring pardon.

                  That the ſinner haue purpoſe to doe penance, and therefore he muſt willingly accept that puniſhment which his ghoſtly father ſhal appoint him, and performe it with ſpeede, conſidering that God doth him moſt high fauour, in pardoning him the eternall paine of hell, and is contented with a temporal paine, much leſſe then his ſinnes haue deſerued.

                  M
                  We reape foure very great commodities by this Sacrament. The firſt is that which was ſaide euen now, that God doth pardon vs the ſinnes committed after Baptiſme, and doth change the eternall paine of hell, into a temporall paine, to bee ſuffered in this life, or in Purgatory. The ſecond, that the good workes which wee had wrought, during the time we were in grace, and were loſt by ſin, are reſtored to vs by meanes of this Sacrament. The third is, that we bee looſed from the band of Excommunication, if perhaps we were tyed therewith. For you muſt knowe that Excommunication is a moſt grieuous puniſhment, which depriueth vs of the prayers of Holye church, of lawfully receiuing the ſacraments, likewiſe of conuerſing with faithful people, & finally of holy

buriall, and from this ſo terrible a puniſhmēt, wee are deliuered, by the Sacrament of penance, according to the authority, which the Confeſſors haue of the Biſhoppe or of the Pope. Albeit this abſolution from Excommunication may alſo be geuen without the Sacrament, by the Prelate, though he be no Prieſt. The fourth and laſt fruit is, that wee are made capable of the indulgences which the Popes do often geue.

                  M.
                  Indulgence is a Liberty which God doth vſe by meanes of his Vicar, with his faithful, by pardoning their temporall paine, either all or ſome part, which they were to ſuffer for their ſinnes in this life, or in purgatory.

                  That a man bee in the grace of God, and therefore he muſt confeſſe

himſelf, if he be in ſin: & that he fulfil ſo much as the Pope appointeth, when he granteth the Indulgence.

                  Holy Church commaundeth that euery one confeſſe, at the leaſt, once in the yeere. But it is further neceſſarie to confeſſe euerie time that the partie will communicate, if hee bee in mortall ſinne. And likewiſe when he is in peril of death, or goeth about any thinge wherein is danger he may die. And beſides theſe, it is verie well done to confeſſe often, to keepe cleane a mans conſcience, eſpecially for that hee that confeſſeth ſeldom can hardly do it well.

                  Al are reduced to three, to-wit, Prayer, Faſting, and Almes. For ſo

the Angell Raphel taught Tobie, The reaſon whereof is, for that a man hauing a ſoule, a body, and externall goods: by prayer he offereth vnto God the goods of the ſoule, by faſting, the goods of the bodie, by almes the externall goods. By prayer is vnderſtoode the hearing of Maſſe, ſaying of the ſeuen Pſalmes, the Offfice of the dead, and other like things. By faſting is vnderſtood all corporall auſteritie, as wearing of heare-cloth, whipping, lying on the ground, pilgrimages, and the like. By almes, is vnderſtood, all other works of charitie, & ſeruice done to our neighbour, for the loue of God.

                  M
                  It is better that our ſelues ſatiſfie by theſe wordes, becauſe by Indulgence is ſatisfied onely, for the bond of paine, or puniſhment, but by theſe workes we do both ſatisfie, and withall merite eternall life: but beſt of all is, to vſe both their helps, ſatisfying our ſelues ſo much as wee can, & withall taking Indulgences.

                  Extreame Vnction, is a Sacrament, which our Lord inſtituted for the ſick. It is called Vnction, becauſe it conſiſteth in annoynting the ſicke with holie Oyle, and receyting ouer him certaine prayers. And it is called Extreame, as being the laſt amongſt the Vnctions, which are vſed in the Sacramēts of the church.

For the firſt vnction is giuen in Baptiſme, the ſecond in confirmatiō, the third in Prieſthood, the laſt in ſicknes: & it may alſo be called extreme for that it is giuē at the end of the life

                  M
                  They are three. The firſt is remiſsion of ſins, that remaine ſometimes after the other Sacraments, to wit, thoſe which the party did not remember or not know, and which, if he had knowen and remembred, he would willingly haue repented, and confeſſed them. The ſecond is, to cō
                     ſort the ſicke, & to make him ſtronger in ſpirite in that time, when hee findeth himſelfe oppreſſed with bodely infirmities, and with temptations of the diuel. The third is, to reſtore the health of the bodie, if that be expedient for the eternal ſaluation of the ſame ſicke perſon. And theſe three effects are ſignifyed by

the oyle, which is vſed in this Sacrament, for that oyle refreſheth, ſtrengthneth and healeth.

                  M
                  In this, many doe commit great error, who wil not take this Sacramēt but when they are in departing this life: for the true time to take it is, whē the phiſitions iudge the diſeaſe to be dangerous, for when humane remedies ſeem to be inſufficient, the celeſtial remedies are chiefly to beſought for. And ſo ſometimes it hapneth, that by the meanes of this holy oyle, the ſicke party doth recouer health, therefore as this Sacrament ought not to bee demanded, when there is no danger to die: ſo ought it not to be deferred ſo long, till there bee no hope remaining. And this is the cauſe why holie oyle is not giuen to thoſe that are put to death by juſtice, becauſe ſuch are neither

ſicke, nor haue hope of life.

                  It is a Sacrament in whtch power is giuen, to conſecrate the moſt holie Euchariſt, and to miniſter the other Sacraments to the people: or to ſerue by proper offiee, thoſe that haue receiued ſuch power. And it is called Order, becauſe there are manie degrees in this Sacrament, one ſubordinate to an other. As Prieſts, Deacons, and other inferiors. But of theſe there is no neede to tell you any more, ſeing this Sacrament doth not pertaine to all, but only to men of yeares and learning, who are not to learne the Chriſtian doctrine, but rather it belongeth to them to teach others.

                  The Sacrament of Matrimonie, is the lawfull joyning of man and woman in holie wedlocke: which ſignifyeth and repreſenteth the Vnion of Chriſt with his Church, by the Incarnation: and the vnion of God with the ſoule by grace.

                     ſelues wel, & to loue each other ſpiritually, as Chriſt loueth his Church, and as God loueth a faithful & juſt ſoule. Secondly, it conferreth grace, to know and to deſire to bring vp their children in the feare of God. Thirdly, it produceth a bonde betweene the husband and the wife ſo ſtraight, that it is not poſsible to bee diſſolued, like as betweene Chriſt & his Church. And hereof it commeth that no bodie can diſpence that the husband leaue his firſt wife, & take

an other, neither that the wife leaue her firſt husband, and take an other.

                  Three things are neceſſarie. Firſt that the parties be without impediment to be ioyned together; that is, that they be not kinsfolkes within the fourth degree; that they haue no ſolemne vowe of chaſtitie, nor the like. Secondly, that in contracting of Matrimonie, there be witneſſes, and that in particular, the Curate or proper Paſtor be preſent, or (as wee cal him) the Parriſh Prieſt. Thirdly that the conſent of both parties be free, not forced by any great feare; & that it be expreſſed by wordes, or ſome equiualent ſigne. And if anie of theſe three things ſhal be wanting the Mariage is not of force.

                  The Apoſtle S. Paul hath cleered this doubt, hauing written, that who ioyneth himſelfe in Mariage doth wel, but he that doth not ioyne himſelf, but keepeth virginitie doth better. And the reaſon is, becauſe Mariage is a thing humane, virginitie is Angelical. Mariage is according to nature, Virginitie is aboue nature. And not only virginitie but widowhood alſo is better then mariage. Therefore whereas our Sauiour ſaid in a parable, that the good ſeede yelded in one field thirtie fold fruit; in an other threeſcore, in an other a hundred fold: the holie Doctors haue declared, that the thirtie fold fruite is of Matrimonie, the threeſcore fold of widowhood, hundereth fold of virginitie.
               
            
         
         
            
            Cap. X. Of vertues in general.
            YOv haue declared the foure principall partes of Chriſtian Doctrine: I deſire to know, if there be any thing elſe to learne?
            
               M
               The neceſſarie thinges to bee knowne, are thoſe foure which I haue already ſhewed you. But there be ſome other things profitable alſo, to the end we pretend of obtayning eternall ſaluation, to wit, Vertues and Vices, good workes and ſinnes. For albeit wee haue ſpoken alreadie of theſe things in general, in the declaration of the Creede, and of the Commandements, yet it will be very profitable to ſpeake of them more diſtinctly and in particular.
            
            
               S
               Tell me then what is vertue?
            
            
               M
               Vertue is a qualitie which is receiued in the ſoule, and maketh a man good. For as ſcience maketh a man a good Philoſopher, and art maketh one a good artificer: ſo vertue

maketh a good man, and cauſeth him to doe that which is good, and that with facilitie, readineſſe and perfection. Whereas hee that hath not vertue, though hee may ſometimes do well, yet he ſhall not doe it without difficultie and imperfection, whereof to giue you ſome example, vertue is like to art, and practiſe. For you ſee one that hath art, to play on the Citerone or Lute, playeth both wel & with facilitie, although he neuer look vpō the ſtrings, where as an other that hath not the art, or hath not practiſe, may well touch the ſtrings, and make them ſounde, but hee ſhall neither doe it readily nor ſo well. Euen ſo hee that hath the vertue (for example) of Temperance, faſted with great facilitie and cheerefulneſſe, when it is needfull, and hee faſteth perfectly, expecting the conuenient houre, and eating meates appoynted, and

once only, but he that hath not this vertue, or contrariwiſe is a glutton, it ſeemeth a death to him to faſt, and if perhaps hee faſt, he can not well expect the due houre of dinner, and after at night, in place of a drinking as the cuſtome is, he will make ſo large a collation, as wanteth little of a ſupper.
            
            
               S
               How manie vertues be there?
            
            
               M
               The vertues are very manie: but the more principall, & to which all the reſt are reduced, are ſeuen, to wit the three Theological, Faith, Hope, & Charitie, & foure Cardinall, Prudence, Iuſtice, Fortitude, & Temperance: & according to this number, there are ſeuen giftes of the Holie Ghoſt, and the Euangelical Beatitudes, which guide vs to the perfection of Chriſtian life. There be alſo ſeuen workes of mercie corporall: & ſeuen ſpirituall. Of all which I will geue you a briefe inſtruction.
            
         
         
            
            Chap. II. Of the Theologicall Vertues.
            
               S
               VVHat is faith?
            
            
               M
               Faith is the firſt of the Theological vertues, that is, of thoſe vertues which haue immediat relation to God. And the proper office of faith is, to illuminate and eleuate the vnderſtanding, to beleue firmely all that God, by his Church, reueileth vnto vs: although it bee otherwiſe heard and aboue naturall reaſon.
            
            
               S
               What is the cauſe, that wee muſt beleeue matters of faith ſo firmly?
            
            
               M
               The cauſe is, for that faith doth relie vpon infallible veritie, for ſo much as all that faith propoſeth vnto vs, is reueiled from God, & God is veritie it ſelf. Wherefore it is impoſſible that, which God ſayeth, ſhould be falſe. And ſo when faith propoſeth anie thing vnto vs, which

appeareth contrarie to reaſon, as for example, that a virgin ſhould bring forth a child, it is neceſſarie to conſider that humaine reaſon is feeble, & may eaſely be deceiued, but God can not be deceiued nor deceiue vs.
            
            
               S
               What is neceſſarie to be beleued, by this vertue of faith?
            
            
               M
               It is neceſſarie to beleue diſtinctly, al the Articles of the Crede, which before I haue declared. And ſpecially thoſe Articles, whereof Feaſts are kept, euerie yeare in holie Church: as the Incarnation of our Lord, the Natiuitie, the Paſſion, the Reſurrection, the Aſcenſion, the comming of the Holie Ghoſt, & the moſt Holie Trinitie. Moreouer wee muſt be readie to beleeue, al that ſhalbe declared vnto vs, by holie Church. And finally in all out ward behauiour, to ſhunne and auoide thoſe things, which haue anie ſhew of infidelitie, as to carrie the habit

of a Turke, or of the Iewes, the eating of fleſh on daies forbidden as Heretikes do, and ſuch like. For that it is neceſſarie, to confeſſe the true faith, not only in hart & with mouth but alſo with exterior deeds, to ſhew our ſelues to diſlike of all Sects, that are contrary to holie Church.
            
            
               S
               What is hope?
            
            
               M
               Hope is the ſecond Theological vertue, ſo called, becauſe it alſo hath immediat relation to God. For as by faith we beleue in God, ſo by hope, we truſt or hope in God.
            
            
               S
               What is the office of Hope?
            
            
               M
               It is to eleuate our mind to hope for eternall felicitie. And becauſe, this is ſo heigh a benefit, that it was not poſſible to reach thereto by humaine abilitie, therfore God geueth vs this ſupernaturall vertue, that by it we may truſt, to attaine to ſo great a good.
            
            
               S
               Whereupon is this hope grounded,

and whereupon doth it relie?
            
            
               M
               It is grounded, and doth relie vpon the infinite goodneſſe & mercie of God, whereof wee haue moſt certaine ſignes: ſeeing hee hath giuen vs his owne Sonne, and by his meanes adopted vs for his children, and promiſed vs the inheritance of the kingdome of Heauen, if we doe works cōformable to the dignity receiued, & hath alſo giuen vs grace & ſufficient help, to do ſuch works.
            
            
               S
               What is Charitie?
            
            
               M
               It is the third Theologicall vertue, hauing immediat relation to God: by this vertue our ſoule is eleuated to loue God aboue all things. Not only as Creator & Author of al our natural good, but alſo as the g
                     •…
                   of grace and of glorie, which are ſupernaturall.
            
            
               S
               I would know, whether charitie be alſo extended vnto creatures?
            
            
               M
               Charity is properly extended vnto

all men, and to all things, which God hath made. But with this difference, that God is to bee loued for himſelfe, he being infinitly good, & it is further extended, to all other things, which are to be loued, for the loue of God. And in particular our neighbour, our parents or frends are not onely to be vnderſtood, but alſo euerie man though he would be our enemie, becauſe euerie man is the Image of God, and for the ſame is to be loued.

               M
               It is the greateſt of all others, & it is ſo great, that whoſoeuer hath it, can not loſe his ſaluation if he firſt loſe not charitie. And he that hath it not, can by no meanes be ſaued, though he had al the other vertues, and gifts of God.

                  It is the firſte of the

foure Cardinal vertues, which haue this name, becauſe they be principal vertues, and as fountaines of all the other moral and humaine vertues. For that Prudence gouerneth the vnderſtanding, Iuſtice gouerneth the wil. Fortitude gouerneth the iraſcible power, And Temporance gouerneth the appetite of concupiſcence.

                  It is to ſhew the due end of euerie action, & the conuenient meanes and all the circumſtances, to wit, the time, the place, the manner, & ſuch like; that the worke may be wei done in all points & perfectly. And therfore it is called the myſtris of other vertues, and is as ſalt to meats, and as the ſunne in the world.

                  Vertue conſiſteth in the middeſt, and hath alwayes two contrarie

vices, which are in the extreames, One vice contrarie to Prudence, is Imprudence, that is, inconſideration and raſhnes: and it is in thoſe, that do not conſider what they haue to do; & ſo either they looke not to the true end, or they vſe not the true meanes. The other vice is ſubtiltie: or carnal pollicie: and it is in thoſe that with great diligence think of the end, & of the meanes, but they direct al things to their priuat commoditie, for the gaining of ſome worldlie benefit. And therfore they endeuour ſubtilly, to deceiue their neighbour, to bring to paſſe their buſines to their owne purpoſe. But in the end it will appeare, that ſuch are moſt impudent, loſing the moſt ſoueraigne good, for the loue of things of no impotence.

                  M
                  Iuſtice is a vertue, which geueth

euery one that is his own: and ſo the office thereof is to make things iuſt, & to put equalitie in humaine contracts: which is the foundation of quietnes & of peace. For if each one would be cōtent with his own, & not couet that belōgeth to an other, ther ſhould neuer be war nor diſcorde.

                  M
                  They are two. One is Iniuſtice, that is, when one taketh that which belongeth to an other, or in cōtracts giueth leſſe then he ought, or taketh more then is due to him. The other is too much juſtice, that is, whē one is too rigorous, & wreaſteth things by pretence of juſtice more ſeueerely then reaſon requireth. For in ſome caſes, it is neceſſarie, that compaſsion bee mixed with juſtice. As if a poore man, can not pay all he oweth preſently, without his great loſſe or damage, it is a reaſonable thing and

juſt, that he haue a litle time graunted him: and to denie him the ſame is to great rigour.

                  They are cowardlines, & audacious temeritie. For cowardlines maketh one to yeeld too eaſely; Which cōmeth of the lacke of fortitude: & audatious temeritie, maketh one put himſelfe in danger, when there is no

need. Which (ſo to tearme it) is too much fortitude. And it deſerueth no praiſe but blame, and therefore is no vertue but a vice.

                  M
                  They are Intemperance, and Inſenſibility. Intemperance is, when one is too much giuen to delights, and therefore committeth exceſſes in eating, and ſuch thinges as doe hurt both the ſoule and the bodie. Inſenſibilitie is, when a man vſeth the other extreame, and ſo flyeth all pleaſures, that he wil not eate things neceſſarie for his health, to auoyd that little delectation, which conuenient

meats doe naturally bring. But the vice of intēperance is much more common amongſt men, then the vice of inſenſibilitie. And therefore all holie men, by word and example, haue exhorted vs to faſting, & to mortification of the fleſh.

               They are thoſe which the Prophet Iſaie hath taught vs, to wit, Wiſdome, Vnderſtanding, Counſaile, Fortitude, Knowledge, Pietie, and the Feare of our Lord.

               M
               To attaine to the perfection of Chriſtian life: For they are as the ladder, by which wee clime vp, from the ſtate of ſinne by diuers degrees, euen to the higheſt of ſanctitie. But you muſt knowe, that the Prophet numbreth theſe ſteppes comming

downwards. For he did ſee as it were a ladder which came from Heauen. Neuertheles we will recoont the aſcending, as going vpwards & aſcending from earth to heauen. The firſt degree then is, the Feare of our lord, which doth terrifie a ſinner, whē he thinketh that he hath God almighty his enemiet the ſecond degree is Pietie: For he that feareth puniſhment which God threatneth againſt a ſinner, beginneth to become godlie, & deſireth to obey and ſerue God, and to worke his holie will in all things. The thirde degree is Knowledge, for that hee vvho deſireth to vvorke the vvill of God, demaundeth of God that he will teach him, his holie commandements, & God partly by Preachers, partly by books, & partly by inwarde inſpirations, teacheth him all that is neceſſarie. The fourth degree is Fortitude, for hee that knoweth, and is willing in all

thinges to ſerue God, findeth many difficulties & tentatiōs of the world the fleſh & the diuel. And therefore god at that time of need giueth him the gift of Fortitude, that he may ouercome al difficulties. The fift degree is Counſell, for when the diuell cannot preuaile by force, he turneth himſelf to decepts, and vnder pretence of good, prouoketh the juſt man to fall: yet God doth not abandon him, but giueth him the gift of Counſell, by which he preuaileth againſt the deceipts of the enemy: the ſixt is the gift of Vnderſtāding, for when a mā is wel exerciſed in actiue life, and hath had many victories againſt the diuel, god doth draw him & exalt him to contemplatiue life, and with the gifte of vnderſtanding, maketh him to vnderſtande and penitrate diuine Myſteries. The ſeauenth, is the gift of Wiſdome, which is the cōplement of perfection

For he is wiſe that knoweth the firſt cauſe of all thinges, and according thereto, formeth al his actions: which none can doe, but hee that joyneth perfect charitie, to the gift of vnderſtanding. For by the vnderſtanding he knoweth the firſt cauſe, and by charitie, hee directeth and diſpoſeth all thinges vnto it, as vnto the laſt ende. And becauſe wiſdome joyneth the affection to vnderſtanding, therefore it is called wiſdome, that is, ſauorie knowledge, as Saint Barnard teacheth vs.

               They are an other ladder to clime vnto perfection, like vnto that of the gifts of the Holie Ghoſt. For that in ſeauen ſentences, are conteyned ſeauen degrees, to arriue vnto beatititude. And laſtly, the eight doth

geue vs a ſigne to know whether a man haue aſcended vp theſe degrees or no.

               M
               Chriſt our Lord, in the three firſt degrees, teacheth vs to take away the impediments of perfection, whereby we aſcend vnto felicitie. The generall and ordinarie impediments are three; the deſire of goods, of honors, and pleaſures. So Chriſt ſaith in the firſt degree, that the poore in ſpirit are bleſſed, that is, thoſe who willingly diſpiſe goods. In the ſecond he ſaith, that the meeke are bleſſed, that is, thoſe that geue place to all, not reſiſting thoſe, that put themſelues before, and thruſt them behinde. In the third he ſaith, that thoſe are bleſſed that weepe, that is, thoſe that ſeeke not the delights, and pleaſures of the world, but attend to do penance, and to

be waile their ſinnes. In other two degrees he teacheth vs the perfection of the actiue life, which conſiſteth in fulfilling all that wee are bound vnto by iuſtice, and by charitie. Therefore he ſaith in the fourth degree, that thoſe are bleſſed, that hunger and thirſt iuſtice. And in the fift he ſaith, that the mercifull are bleſſed. In the laſt two, he draweth vs to perfection of the contemplatiue life: and therfore he ſaith in the ſixt, that they are bleſſed, that haue a cleane hart, for they ſhall ſee God, that is, they ſhall ſee him in the life to come, in glorie; and in this they ſhall know him by grace of contemplation: & in the ſeuenth he ſaith, that the peaceable are bleſſed becauſe they ſhal be called the children of God; that is, bleſſed are they who hauing added perfect charitie, to contemplation, haue made al their repoſe in God, and pacified all

the Kingdome of the ſoule, and ſo they ſhalbe children of God, like vnto their Father, holie and perfect. In the eight ſentence no new degree of perfection is contained, as S. Auguſtine doth well ſay, but there is declared a manifeſt ſigne, to know if one be arriued to perfection: & this ſigne is to ſuffer willingly vniuſt perſecutiō, for the like as that gold is tried in the fornace, ſo is a iuſt and perfect man in tribulations.

               S
               IT remaineth that you declare to me the workes of mercie, aſwell corporall as ſpirituall.
            
            
               M
               The workes of mercie corporall are ſeuen. Whereof we haue ſix in the holie goſpel; to wit, to geue meate to ſuch as haue hunger: to geue drinke to ſuch as haue thirſte, to cloth the naked: to harbour pilgrims: to viſite the ſicke: to comforte the

impriſoned. The ſeauenth worke, which is to burie the dead, holie Tobie hath taught vs, and the Angel Raphael. The workes of mercie ſpiritual are alſo ſeuen? to inſtruct the ignorant: to geue counſaile to the doubtfull: to comfort the afflicted: to correct ſuch as erre: to pardon offences: to beare with other mens defects: and to pray to God for the quick and dead.
            
            
               S
               Is there anie cauſe that excuſeth vs, from the workes of mercie?
            
            
               M
               Three things may excuſe vs. The firſt is when a man hath not the meanes to do them: and ſo that good Lazarus, the poore begger, of whom it is read in the Goſpel, did no corporall workes of mercie, becauſe himſelfe had need, in a manner of all thoſe workes, and ſo was crouned for his patience. And this is the ordinance of God, that the rich may ſaue themſelues, by ſhewing mercie,

& the poore by the way of patience, and ſo he that hath not knowledge or prudence for himſelfe, is not bound to teach or giue counſaile to others. The ſecond cauſe is, when a man ſerueth God in a higher ſorte, then the actiue life is, and by reaſon of that ſtate, hath no occaſion to do manie workes of charitie, ſo the holie Eremits, that remayne incloſed in ſolitarie places, or in their cels, to contemplate heauenlie thinges, are not bound to leaue that holie exerciſe, and goe to ſeeke thoſe, to whom they may do workes of mercie. The third cauſe is, when a man doth not finde anie that hath notorious need of his mercie: for that we are not bound to ſuccor anie but thoſe, who can not help themſelues, or haue not others that will and can help them. True it is, that perfect mercie doth not expect the time of the bond, but is readie to ſuccour in the beſt manner

it can, and all that it can.
            
            
               S
               It ſeemeth to mee that all men may worke the laſt worke of mercie, that is, to praye to God for our neighbour?
            
            
               M
               So it is, and therefore the holie Eremits do alſo the works of mercie, for that they pray to god that he giue his grace to al thoſe that need it.

               IT is nowe time that you teach mee, what vice and ſinne is, to flie from it: like as you haue inſtructed me in vertues and good works, to obtaine them.
            
            
               M
               Sinne is nothing elſe but a voluntarie committing, or omitting againſt the lawe of God: where you haue to conſider, that three things are required to a ſinne. Firſt, that there be ſome act committed, or omitted, that is, to doe and worke a thing forbidden, or not to doe a thing commanded. As for example,

to blaſpheame is a committing, not to heare Maſſe is an omiſsion. Secondly is required, that this committing, or omitting be againſt the law of God: for that the law of God is the rule of well-working: like as the arte of a Maiſon, is the rule of making a Wall well: And therefore as a Maiſon is not a good Maiſon, and maketh not a Wall well, when he worketh not according to art: ſo a man liueth not well, and is not a good man, when hee followeth not the law of God. And by the lawe of God, is not only vnderſtood, that which he hath giuen by himſelfe, as the ten commandements are, but that alſo, which he giueth vs by his vicar in earth, the Pope his holines, and other ſuperiors, aſwell ſpirituall as temporal: becauſe al are the miniſters of God, & haue authoritie frō him: thirdly, is required, that cōmitting, or omitting be voluntarie: for

whatſoeuer is done without conſent of the will, is no ſinne. As for example, if one blaſpheme when he ſleepeth, or hath not the vſe of reaſon, or probably knoweth not, that ſuch a word is blaſphemie: in ſuch a caſe a man ſinneth not: becauſe there is no conſent of the will.
            
            
               S
               I haue vnderſtood, what ſinne is, now tell me what vice is?
            
            
               M
               Vice is an euill habite, or an euil cuſtome of ſinning, procured by often ſinning. Whereof commeth, that a nan ſinneth more eaſely: and with more boldnes and alacritie. As (for example) we do call one a blaſphemer, or a gameſter, when he is woont to blaſpheme, or vſeth gamming. So that to blaſpheme is a ſin, & to be a blaſphemer is a vice. And ſo we may ſay of al the other ſinnes.
            
            
               S
               Is ſinne a great euil?
            
            
               M
               It is the greateſt euil that can be found. Yea rather, it onlie is abſolutly

euill, & diſpleaſeth God more then any thing elſe, which appeareth by this, that God ſpareth not to deſtroy & looſe the moſt noble things that hee hath, to puniſh finne. If a Prince had a veſſell of ſiluer, or of gold moſt fayre and moſt precious, and finding in it ſome ſtincking liquore, ſhould be ſo diſpleaſed there with, that he ſhould breake it & caſt it into the bottome of the Sea, you would doubtles ſay, that Prince had a wounderfull great hate againſte that liquore. So God hath made two moſt precious veſſels: one of ſiluer, which is man, & one of gold which is an Angell. And for that hee hath found this ſtincking liquore of ſin, in the one and in the other, he hath broken them, and caſt into the bottome of hell to perpetuall miſerie, all thoſe Angels that ſinned, and daily caſteth into the ſame place of perdition, all thoſe men that die in their

And once for the ſins of the world, he brought vpon it the Deluge, and drowned all, except Noe and his familie that liued juſtlie.

               M
               Sinne is of two ſorts. For one is called Original ſinne, and the other Actuall. And actual ſinne is likewiſe of two ſorts; one mortal, and the other veniall.

               VVHat is original ſinne?
            
            
               M
               Originall ſinne is that in which we are borne: and it commeth vnto vs by ſucceſsion frō our firſt father Adam. For you haue to know, that when God made the firſt man, and the firſt woman, called Adam and Eue, he gaue them ſeuen gifts. Firſt, he gaue them his grace, by which they were iuſte, and the friends of God, & his adopted children. Secondly, he gaue them great

knowledge, how to doe well and to ſhunne euill. Thirdly, he gaue them obedience of the fleſh to the ſpirite, that it ſhould not be mooued to vnlawful deſires againſt reaſō. Fourthly, hee gaue them promptnes and great facilitie to do well, and to flie euill, and but one moſt eaſie commandement to obſerue. Fiftly, hee freed them from all labour, and feare. For the earth brought foorth fruites ſufficient for mans life of it ſelf: neither was there any thing that could hurt man: Sixtly, hee made them immortall, that is, that they ſhould neuer haue dyed, if they had not ſinned. Seauenthly, hee would after ſome time haue tranſlated thē into Heauen, to ſuch an eternal and glorious life, as Angels haue. But the firſt man and woman, inueigled by the Diuell, did not obſerue that commandement, and ſo they ſinned againſt God, and thereby loſt

thoſe ſeuen giftes, which I ſpoke of. And becauſe God gaue them thoſe giftes, not only for them ſelues, but alſo for all their poſteritie, therefore they loſt them, for themſelues and for vs all: and made vs partakers of their ſinne, and of all their miſeries: as we ſhould haue bene of all their graces, and other benefites, if they had not ſinned. This then is Original ſinne, an emnitie with God, and a priuation of his grace, with which priuation wee are borne. Whereof proceedeth ignorance, euil inclinations, difficultie to do well, and facilitie to do euill, the paine & trauel to prouide to liue, the feares and periles in which we remaine, moſt certaine death of the bodie, & alſo eternall death in hell, if before we dye, we be not deliuered of ſinne, & returne not into the ſauour of God.
            
            
               S
               What remedie haue wee againſt

this Originall ſinne?

               It is already ſaide before, that the remedie is the Paſsion & death of Chriſt our Lorde. For ſo God would that hee that ſhould ſatisfie for the ſinne of Adam, ſhould bee himſelfe without ſin: and the ſame was God and man, and ſo hee was infinitely acceptable to God, and did obey, not in an eaſie thing, as that was, which was commanded to Adam, but in a moſt hard thing, as was the ignominious death of the Croſſe. And this remedie is applyed to vs by holie Baptiſme, as hath bin ſaide. And albeit God doth not ſtraight-waies render vnto vs, all thoſe ſeauen gifts, yet he hath reſtored to vs, the moſt principall which is his grace, by meanes whereof, we are made iuſt, the friends and children of God and heires of Heauen. The other gifts ſhalbe reſtored vnto vs hereafter with great increaſe in

the other life, if we behaue our ſelues well in this.
            
         
         
            Cap. XVIII. Of mortal and veniall ſinne.
            
               S
               DEclare vnto me now, what is actuall ſinne, and how one is mortall and an other veniall.
            
            
               M
               Actuall ſinne is that which wee commit by our owne will, when wee are come to the vſe of reaſon. As to ſteale, to kill, to ſweare falſely, and ſuch like things, contrarie to the law of God. And it is mortal ſinne, when it depriueth vs of the grace of God, which is the life of the ſoule, & maketh one worthie of eternal death in hell. It is veniall ſinne, when it diſpleaſeth God, but not ſo much that it depriueth vs of his grace and meriteth puniſhment, but not eternall.
            
            
               S
               How ſhall I know, whether the ſin be mortal or venial?
            
            
               M
               To know when a ſinne is mortall, you muſt obſerue two rules, one

is, that the ſinne be contrarie to the charitie or loue of God, or of our neighbour. The other, that it bee with full conſent of the will. For when either of theſe two things is wanting, it is not mortall but veniall. And a ſinne is then ſaid to bee aagainſt charitie, when it is againſt the lawe in a matter of weight, as when it is a ſufficient offence to breake friendſhip: but when it is in a ſmall matter, ſuch as ordinarilie breaketh not friendſhip: It is not then againſt charitie: but is ſaid, not to be according to charitie. And ſo ſuch as commonly breaketh friendſhip is againſt the law, becauſe it is againſt charitie, which is the end of the law, ſuch as commonly breaketh not frendſhip, is not againſt the law, but not acording to the law, becauſe it is not againſt charitie, but not according to charitie. Take an exāple to ſteale a great quantitie of money,

is a mortal ſinne: becauſe it is againſt the law of God, being in a matter of weight, and in the iudgement of moſt men ſufficient to breake frendſhip, and ſo is againſt charitie: but to ſteale a farthing, or a pinne, or a like thing, is not a mortall ſinne, but a venial, becauſe it is in a ſmall matter: which although it be not according to charitie, yet it is not againſt charitie: becauſe it is not a thing that in reaſon can breake frendſhip. In like manner we may ſay of being voluntarie. For when a thing is againſt the law, in a matter of weight, and fully, voluntarie, it is a mortall ſinne: but if it be not fully voluntarie, as if one haue a thought, or a ſodaine deſire to ſteale, or to kill, or to blaſpheme, and preſently perceiueth his error, before he fully conſent with his will, it is only a veniall ſin. Therefore a man muſt ſtand vpon his gard, and preſently as he is aware

of an euil thought, or deſire, he muſt driue it away, before they geue conſent.
            
         
         
            Chap. XIX. Of the ſeuen Capitall ſinnes.
            
               S
               I Deſire now to know, which be the moſt principall ſinnes, to the end I may flie them with more diligence.
            
            
               M
               Some ſinnes are more principal, becauſe they are as fountaines or roots of others, and therefore called capital, and theſe are ſeuen. Others are more principall for that they are more hard to be pardoned, and are called ſins againſt the Holie Ghoſt, and they are ſix. Finally there are others more principall, becauſe they are more manifeſtly enormious, and againſt all reaſon, and therfore it is ſaid, that they crie for reuenge to Heauen, and they are foure.
            
            
               S
               Which are the Capitall ſinnes?
            
            
               M
               They are theſe, Pride, or (as

others call it) Vainglorie, Couetouſnes, Lecherie, Enuie, Glutonie, Anger and Sloath.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore are they called capitall?
            
            
               M
               They are not called capitall, becauſe they are mortal: for many ſins are mortall, and are not capitall, as blaſphemie and murder; and many capital, which are not alwaies mortal as gluttony, anger & ſloath. But they are called capitall, becauſe they are heads of many others, which proceed from them, as branches from the roote, and riuers from the fountaines.
            
            
               S
               What is Pride, what ſinnes doth it bring forth, and what is the remedie againſt it?
            
            
               M
               Pride is a ſinne, by which a man thinketh himſelf to be more then he is, and ſo preferreth himſelfe aboue others, not willing to haue others a boue him nor equall with him. The

ſinnes which it produceth, are vaine glorie, and vaunting of him ſelfe, contending with others, diſcorde, diſobedience, and the like. The remedie is to attende with all diligence to holiehumilitie, that is, to know that a man is nothing of him ſelfe & that al we haue, is the gift of God, and to thinke that others are better then wee, and therefore to eſteeme our ſelues leſſe then others, in minde to ſubmit our ſelues to all, & outwardly to honor all others according to their degrees. It helpeth alſo to conſider, that pride maketh a man like the diuel, and that it pleaſeth God highly: whereupon it is written, that God reſiſteth proude men, and boweth himſelfe to humble men: he confoundeth the proud and exalteth the humble.
            
            
               S
               What is Couetouſneſſe, what are the ſinnes which come of it, and the remedie againſt it?
            
            
               
               M
               Couetouſneſſe is a diſordinate affection towards riches, and it conſiſteth in three things. Firſt in deſiring the goods of others, not being contente with his owne. Secondly in deſiring more then is ſufficient and not willing to giue the ſuperfluous to the poore, as we are bound. Thirdly, in louing thoſe goods, wee haue too much, though they be our owne, and not ſuperfluous. And this appeareth when a man is not found readie to looſe his goodes, in a caſe that is neceſſarie, for the honour of God. And therefore Sainte PAVL ſaith, that couetouſneſſe is (in ſome ſort) Idolatrie, for that the couetous man preferreth his goods before God, ſeeing hee is contented rather to looſe God then his goods. The ſinnes then which proceed of couetouſneſſe are manie, as Theft, Robrie, deceipts in buying and ſelling, crueltie towards the poore, & other

like: the remedy is to exerciſe our ſelus in the vertue of liberalitie, conſidering that in this life, wee are trauellers and pilgrims: and that therefore it is much better for vs, not to load our ſelues with goods, but to deuide them, with our fellow trauellers, who may carrie them vnto our countrey: and ſo being in part diſburdened, we may make our voyage more eaſely.
            
            
               S
               What is Lecherie, what ſinnes doth it bring forth, and what is the remedie againſt it?
            
            
               M
               Leacherie is a diſordinate affection towards cardinall pleaſures & delights. The ſinnes which proceed from it, are Blindnes of minde, Temeritie and Inconſtancie, as alſo Adulterie, Fornication, diſhoneſt words, and all other vncleanneſſe. The remedie is to be well exerciſed in faſting, in prayer, & in flying euil cōpany: becauſe theſe are the means

to keepe chaſtitie: and aboue all for men not to truſt thēſelues, for their owne vertue & holines, but to ſtand aloofe from dangers, and to keepe well their ſenſes, conſidering that the moſt ſtrong Sampſon, the moſt holie Dauid, and the moſt wiſe Salomon, were deceiued with this vice, and fel into great blindnes of mind, & chiefly Salomō, who was brought to adore al the Idols of his cōcubins
            
            
               S
               What is Enuie, what ſinnes doe come of it, & what remedie is there againſt it?
            
            
               M
               Enuie is a ſinne, by which one is diſpleaſed at the good of an other: for that it ſeemeth to diminiſh his owne greatnes. Where you haue to conſider, that when the good of an other diſpleaſeth you, for that he is not worthy to haue it, or becauſe hee vſeth it not well, it is no ſinne. Likewiſe, when you are diſpleaſed, that you alſo haue not the good, which

others haue, and chiefly vertue, deuotion, and the like goodnes, this alſo is no ſinne, but rather is a holie and commendable emulation. But when it diſpleaſeth you, that an other hath ſome goodneſſe, becauſe it ſeemeth to you that it darkneth your glorie, and you would that he had it not, to the end he were not your equal or your better, it is the ſin of Enuie. And it bringeth forth many ſins, as peruerſe iudgemente, ioy of an other mans euill, murmuring, and detraction. For that the enuious ſeeketh to diminiſh the good name of his neighbour. And finally, ſometimes it induceth to commit murder: as Cain did, who for enuie killed his brother: and the Iewes for enuie procured the death of our Lord. The remedie, is to be exerciciſed in brotherlie charitie, & often to thinke that Enuie hurteth more him that enuieth, then him that is

enuied. For that the enuious afflicteth and fretteth himſelfe inwardly, and oftentimes God doth exalt him that is enuied, by that means by which the enuious would haue abaſed him. So wee ſee that the diuel for enuie cauſed man to loſe the terreſtrial Paradiſe, & god by that occaſion wrought, that chriſt came into the world, & ſo gaue vs the celeſtial paradiſe: The brothers of the patriarch Ioſeph, ſold him for enuie, and God by that occaſion brought to paſſe, that Ioſeph became lord of his brothers. Saul for enuie perſecuted Dauid, & God cauſed Saul to loſe the kingdome & gaue it to Dauid.
            
            
               S
               What is Gluttonie, what ſinnes produceth it, and what is the remedie againſt it?
            
            
               M
               Gluttonie is a diſordinate appetite of eating & drinking: which cō
                  ſiſteth in taking more meate then is conuenient, in ſeeking too pretious

meates, in deſiring forbidden meats, as fleſh on the Friday and Saturday, in not exſpecting the houre of eating on faſting daies, and finally in eating with too great deſire & eagerneſſe. The ſinnes which come of gluttonie, are obſcuritie of vnderſtanding, vaine mirth, and babling, And often of Gluttonie, commeth Leacherie, with all the ſinnes which proceed thereof. The remedie is to attende vnto temperance and abſtinence, which helpe both the ſoule and the bodie. And in particular it is moſt profitable to conſider, that the delight of gluttony is very ſhort and often leaueth behinde it long paines of the ſtomacke, of the head, and other like.
            
            
               S
               What is anger, what ſinnes doth it bring, and what remedie is there againſt it?
            
            
               M
               Anger is a diſordinate deſire of reuenge. But you muſt knowe that

moderat & ordinate anger is good. Whereupon the Pſalme ſaith: Bee you angrie and ſinne not. And S. Baſil ſaith, that anger is like to a dogge, which is good when he barketh againſt enemies, but more whē he hurteth friends. The diſorder of anger conſiſteth in three thinges. Firſt, in deſire to be reuenged of him that deſerueth it not, and that hath not offended vs. Secondly, in deſiring to reuenge by priuate authoritie, for that to puniſh and to vſe reuenge againſt malefactors, doth not belong to any, but to Superiors, as to the Prince, or Magiſtrate. And for ſo much as God is the Supreame Prince, he ſaith, that to him reuenge principally belongeth. Thirdly, in reuenging for hatred, and not for zeale of juſtce, and in exceeding in the maner, & in other circumſtances. The ſinnes which come of diſordinate anger, are contentions, injourious

words, furious behauior, outragious actions, as of mad-men: for immoderat anger is like to madneſſe. The remedie is to be exerciſed in the vertues of meekeneſſe, and of patience, conſidering the examples of holie men and of Chriſt himſelfe, who by ſupporting and ſuffering, haue triumphed more gloriouſlie then worldly men do by endeuoring to be reuenged of their enemies.
            
            
               S
               What is Sloath, what ſinnes produceth it, & what is the remedie againſt it?
            
            
               M
               Sloath is called in Greeke Acidia, & ſignifyeth tediouſnes, loathſomnes, and griefe to doe well. And it is a mortal ſinne, when one giueth & taketh loathſomnes to do well, & is diſpleaſed for that he is bound to obſerue the cōmandements of God, and to walke in the way of vertue. The ſinnes which he produceth, are light eſteeming the commaundements:

eaſelie yeelding him ſelfe to vices: deſperation of wel-doing: hatred and diſlike of ſuch as would draw or force a ſinner to leaue ſinne and to take a good way. The remedie is, neuer to be idle, to read good bookes, to conſider the great reward which God promiſeth to thoſe that are diligent and obſeruing his commandements, and the eternall and intollerable puniſhments, which is prouided for the negligent.
            
         
         
            Cap. XX. Of the ſinnes againſt the Holie Ghoſt.
            VVHat & how many be the ſinnes againſt the Holie Ghoſt?
            
               M
               They are ſixe, to wit, deſpaire of our ſaluation: preſumption to bee ſaued without merits: to impugne the knowen truth: enuie at an other mans grace: obſtinacie in ſinne: and finall impenitence.
            
            
               S
               Wherefore are they called ſinnes

againſt the Holie Ghoſt?
            
            
               M
               Becauſe they are committed vpon meere malice, and ſpeacially the third, which is of all other properly a ſinne againſt the Holie Ghoſt: that is, when a man knoweth the truth, and yet will obſtinatly hold, and proue that it is not true. To ſin of malice is ſaid to be againſt the Holie Ghoſt: becauſe goodnes is attributed to the Holie Ghoſt, which is contrarie to malice: like as to ſinne of ignorance, is ſaid to be againſt the Son of God, to whome wiſdome is atributed: and ſinning of frailtie is ſaid to be againſt the Father, to whom power is attributed.
            
            
               S
               What haue theſe ſinnes proper?
            
            
               M
               They haue this, that they are not pardoned in this world, nor in the other, as our Lord admoniſheth vs in the Goſpel. Which yet is thus vnderſtood: that they are hard to be pardoned: becauſe ſeldom & hardly

thoſe that fal into theſe ſinnes, come to true repentance: like as when wee ſay: a diſeaſe is incurable, we will not for all that ſay, it can not be cured by anie meanes: but that it is ſeldome cured, or that ordinarily it is not cured.

               M
               They are four, to wit, wilful murder: carnall ſinnes againſt nature: oppreſſion of the poore, and chiefly of orphans, and widowes: and to defraud workmen of their wages.

               I Would haue ſome general document to flie ſinne.
            
            
               M
               The wiſe man ſaith, Remember thou the laſt things, and thou wilt neuer ſinne. The laſt things are foure, Death, the Generall Iudgement, Hell, and Heauen.
            
            
               S
               Wherfore are theſe foure things called the laſt?
            
            
               M
               Becauſe death is the end of life, and the laſt thing which is to happen in this world. Finall iudgement is the laſt of all the iudgments, that are to be geuen: and therfore there is no appealing from it. Hell is the laſt euil, that melefactours are to haue, and they are to remaine therin for euer, without poſsibilitie euer to change. Heauen is the laſt good, which the good are to haue, & they are neuer to loſe it.
            
            
               S
               I would haue ſome conſiderations, to exerciſe my ſelf in theſe laſt

things, for that remembring my ſelf often of them, I ſhould neuer ſinne, as the wiſe man ſaith whom you alleaged.
            
            
               M
               Concerning death, you may conſider theſe four points. Firſt, that death is moſt certaine, and none can eſcape it. The ſecond, that the houre of death is vncertaine, and manie die when they leaſt thinke of it. The third, that in death all the deſignments of this life do end: and then the vanitie of the world appeareth. The fourth, that at their death euerie one repenteth the euill he hath done, and the omiſsion of good, which he might haue done: & therfore it is great folie to do that, wherof we are ſure to repent vs. Touching Iugement, you may conſider theſe points. Firſt, that the iudgement ſhal be geuen of a moſt important matter, to wit, of the chiefeſt good, or the greateſt euil. Secondly,

it ſhalbe geuen by the higheſt Iudge who knoweth all things, and whom none can reſiſt. Thirdly, it ſhall bee geuen in the preſence of the whole world, where none can hide themſelues. Fourthly, there wil be no hope to flie the ſentene, or the execution of Gods Iuſtice. Concerning Hell, conſider that it is large, long, high and deepe. Large, for that it conteyneth all the paines that can bee imagined. Long, for that they are eternall. High, for that they are all moſt bitter in the higheſt degree. Depe, becauſe they are all abſolute paynes, without mixture of anie ſort of conſolation.
               Concerning Heauen, conſider in like maner, that it is large, for that it conteyneth all the goodnes that can be imagined, and more alſo then we can imagine or deſire. It is long, becauſe all thoſe Beatitudes are eternal. It is high, becauſe they are moſt

high and noble, It is deepe, becauſe they are pure good without any mixture of euill. And here you may adde, that the commodities of this life, haue no one of theſe conditions: for that they are few, ſhort, little, and alwaies mixed with vexations, and troubles of mind. And likewiſe the euils of this world are few, ſhort, litle, and alwaies tempered with ſome conſolation. Wherupon you are to conclude, that all thoſe haue truly loſt their wittes, that for loue of the commodities of this life, or for feare of preſent tribulations, loſe the happines, or fall into the euils, of the world to come.
