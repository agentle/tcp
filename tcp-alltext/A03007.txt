                  Hidder thair paſt, ſemblit thair King beforne.
                  Na Scottis man to that counſall thay cald,

                  Biggit about, that na man enter micht,

                  This Maiſter Iohne ane worthie clerk was yair

                  Richt weill he wiſt, fra Perſee left that land,

                  Wallace fra thame, into the Kirk he ȝeid,
                  Pater Noſter, he ſaid, and als ane Creid.
                  Syne to the Grece he lenit him ſoberly,

                  Of Topaſion him thocht the plumat was,
                  Baith hilt and all, glitterand as the glas.
                  Deir Sone he ſaid, we tary heir to lang,
                  Thow ſall ga ſe, quhair wrocht is mekill wrang.
                  Than he him led to ane montane on hicht,

                  He left him thair, ſyne ſone he fra him went,
                  Thairof Wallace ſtudyit in his Intent.
                  To ſe him thair he had full greit deſyre,
                  Thair with he ſaw begyn ane felloun fyre.
                  Quhilk braithly brynt on breid out throw ye land

                  Than ſone to him deſcendit thair ane Quene,

                  In hir preſence appeirit ſa mekill licht,
                  That all the fyre ſcho put out of his ſicht.
                  Gaif him ane wand of cullour reid and grene,
                  With ane Saphir ſaynit his face and ene.
                  Welcum ſcho ſaid, I cheis the to my lufe,
                  Thow art grantit be the greit God abufe.
                  To help pepill that ſufferis mekill wrang,
                  With the as now, I may nocht tary lang.
                  Thow ſall returne to thyne awin Oiſt agane,

                  Let nocht thairfoir, tak redres of this mis,
                  To thy rewaird thow ſall haue heuinis blis.
                  Of hir richt hand ſcho betaucht him ane buik,
                  Humbly thus hir leif than ſcho tuik.
                  Vnto the Clud aſcendit of his ſicht,
                  Wallace brak vp the buik in all his micht.
                  In thre partis the buik weill writtin was,
                  The firſt letteris, war gros letteris of bras.
                  The ſecund gold, the thrid was ſiluer ſchene,
                  Wallace meruellit quhat this wryting ſuld mene.
                  To reid the buik he beſyit him ſa faſt,
                  His Sprite agane to walkand mynd it paſt.
                  
                     And vp he rais ſyne ſuddandly furth went,
                  This Clerk he fand, and tauld him his Intent.
                  Of this viſioun as I haue ſaid befoir,

                  Ȝit I ſall deme, thocht my cunning be ſmall,
                  God grant na charge efter my wordis fall.
                  The ſtalwart man gaif the that ſword in hand,
                  Fergus it is firſt winnar of Scotland.
                  That montane is, quhair he the had on hicht,

                  He thankit him, and thus his leif hes tane,

                  Wallace anſwerit, had we it heir to ſchaw,

                  Neir Innerwik cheiſit ane feild at waill,
                  With nyne hundreth of lyklie men to waill.
                  Four hundreth was with Wallace in the richt,
                  And thay anone approchit to thair ſicht.
                  Greit falt thair was of gude tretie betuene,
                  To mak concord, and that full ſone was ſene.
                  Without reheirs of actioun in that tyde,
                  On ather part togidder faſt thay ryde.
                  The ſtour was ſtrang, and wounder perrillous,
                  Contenit lang with deidis Cheualrous.
                  Mony thair deit of cruell Scottis blude,
                  Of this tretie the mater is nocht gude.
                  Thairfoir I ceis to tell the diſtructioun,
                  Pietie it was, and all of ane Natioun.
                  Bot Erll Patrik the feild left at the laſt,
                  Richt few with him to Cokburnis peth yair paſt.
                  Aggreuit ſair that his men thus was tynt,
                  Wallace returnit, and wald na langer ſtynt.
                  Towart Dunbar, quhair ſuithfaſt men him tald,
                  Na purueyance was left into that hald.
                  Nor man of fence, all had bene with thair Lord,
                  Quhen Wallace hard the ſicker trew record:
                  Dunbar he tuik all haill at his bandoun,
                  Gaif it to keip to Criſtall of Setoun.
                  Quhilk ſtuffit it weill, with men and gude vittaill
                  Vpon the morne, Wallace that wald nocht faill

                  Erll Patrik Iſchit, for byde him wald he nocht.
                  Sone to the Park Wallace ane range hes ſet,
                  To Bonkill wod Corſpatrik fled but let.
                  And out of it, to Norhame paſſit he,
                  Quhen Wallace ſaw it micht na better be:
                  To Caldſtreme raid, and ludgeit him on Tweid,
                  Erll Patrik than in all haiſt can him ſpeid:
                  And paſſit by or Wallace power rais,
                  Without reſting in Ettrik Foreſt gais.
                  Wallace followit, bot he wald nocht aſſaill,

                  Quir few he had, the ſtrenth was thick and ſtrang
                  Twelf myle on breid, and thairto twyis als lang.
                  Into Cokholme Erll Patrik baid at reſt,
                  For mair power Wallace paſt in the weſt.
                  Erll Patrik than him graithit haiſtelie,
                  In Ingland paſt, to get him thair ſupple.
                  Out throw the land richt eirniſtly cout pas,
                  To Anthonie Beik, that Lord of Durame was.
                  Wallace him put out of Glaſgow befoir,
                  And ſlew Perſe, thair malice was the moir.
                  The Biſchop Beik gart ſone greit power ryſe,

                  ¶How Wallace come in Scotland agane at the Battell of Elchok Park. Cap. iiij.
                  
                     VPon the nicht Wallace the land hes tane,
                     At Ernis mouth, and is to Elchok gane.
                     He gart the Schip in couert ſaill away,
                     Sa out of ſicht, thay war or it was day.
                     At Elchok dwelt, ane Wallace Couſing deir,

                     On the bak ſyde Wallace ane wyndo fand,
                     And in he callit, ſyne Craufurd come at hand.
                     Fra tyme he wiſt, that it was gude Wallace,
                     Into his Barn he ordanit yame ane place.
                     Ane mow of corne he biggit thame about,
                     And cloſit it weill, nane micht perſaif thair out.
                     Bot at ane place quhair meit was to yame brocht
                     And bedding to, als gudly as he mocht.
                     Ane dern hoill furth on the north ſyde thay had,
                     Vnto the watter, quhair of Wallace was glaid.
                     Four dayis or fyue, in reſt yai ſoiornit thair,
                     
                        Quhill meit was gane, than Craufurd bownit for mair
                     To Sāct Iohnſtoun yair purueyance to by
                     Ingliſmen thocht he tuik mair aboundantly:
                     Than he was wount in ony tyme befoir,
                     Thay haue him tane, put him in preſoun 
                           •

                     Quhat gaiſtis he had, to tell thay maid requeiſt,
                     He ſaid it was bot to ane Kirking feiſt.
                     Ȝit thay preſumit the cūming of Wallace,

                     Thay leit him pas with thing that he had bocht,
                     Syne efter ſone in all the haiſt thay mocht.
                     To harnes ȝeid the power of the toun,
                     Aucht hūdreth men wt Buttellar maid yame boun
                     Followit on dreich, quhill yat yis man come hame
                     Wallace him ſaw, and ſaid he ſeruit blame.
                     In my ſleiping ane fell viſioun me tald,
                     Till Ingliſmen, that thow ſuld me haue ſald.
                     Craufurd him ſaid, he had bene torment ſair,
                     With Ingliſmen that had him at diſpair.
                     Thairfoir ryſe vp, and ſone ſum ſuccour ſe,
                     I dreid full ſair thay ſet wachis on me.
                     The worthy ſcottis yai graith yame in guid weid

                     Thus ſuddandly thir feill Sutheroun yai ſaw,

                     That kenely come, with ȝoūg Buttellar ye knicht,
                     Than Wallace ſaid, ane plane land is nocht richt.
                     Bot Elchok Park, that is neir heir beſyde,
                     The firſt ſail ȝe, we think thair to abyde.
                     Nyntene thay war, and Craufurd with gude wil,

                     The Park thay tuik, Wallace ane place hes ſene,
                     Ot greit Holing, yat grew baith heich and grene.

                     The wod was thick, bot lytill of breid and lenth,
                     And yai had meit, yai thocht to hald that ſtrenth.
                     The Ingliſmen than paſt to Craufurdis place,
                     Fand in the barn the ludgeing of Wallace.
                     Than Craufurdis wyfe in handis thay haue tane,
                     And aſkit at hir, quhat way the Scottis is gane?
                     Richt weill thay trowit, that Wallace ſuld yair be
                     Fra France to Tay, he was cūmit throw the ſe.
                     Scho wald nocht tell for boiſt nor ȝit rewaird,
                     Thā Buttellar ſaid, ouir lāg thow hes bene ſpaird

                     And gart thame big ane braid byrnand fire.
                     The Sutheroun ſwore yairin ſcho ſuld brynt be,
                     Than Wallace ſaid ſcho ſall nocht end for me.
                     Greit ſin it war, ȝone faikles wicht to ſla,
                     Or ſcho ſuld end, in faith yair ſall de ma.
                     He left the ſtrenth, and the plane feild can ta,
                     On loud he cryit, and ſaid lo heir thy fa.
                     Thinkis thow not ſchame for to tormēt ane wyfe,
