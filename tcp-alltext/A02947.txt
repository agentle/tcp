Of that was ſumtyme the churche of Chriſt, hath yt made the Synagoge of ſathan euer ſens that aduerſarye was ſett at large afterApoc. 2. Iob. 2. Apoc. 20. Iudae 1. Math. 7. 2.

Neyther ys god therin ſought, nor yet anye godlyneſſe. For inGod is not herin named ones, but to condemp nation. the whole proceſſe ys not he ones named but to condempnacion.
