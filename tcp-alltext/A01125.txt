            To the christian Reader, grace and peace in Christe.
            
               THe short memories and dull wits, of many to conceiue & remember, the most briefe & short sum of Christian Religiō, hath moued me to doo this worke; and that because I see & perceiue by daily proofe and experience, that all meanes and waies assaied, yet hardlie we can preuaile to settle, or beate into the heads and hearts of youth, so necessarie a matter, as is the instruction to right vnderstanding of the principles of Religion.
            I haue heere therfore according to my capacitie and small skill, drawne out a few questions, with Aunsweres annexed and adioined, verie fitte for the simpler sorte, both of youth and age, that are so long and harde to learne. That it greeueth my heart to thinke howe carelesse and heedlesse, many, bothe young and olde be in so needfull a matter, as concernes their saluation.
            But the cause of so small effect taken of

many, is this, partly by the negligence both of Parentes and their youth, both children and seruauntes, the Parents slacknesse in sending them to the Ministers; and theyr carelesnesse when they doo come, and heedlesse hearts in hearing and regarding; and theyr mindlesnesse when the Ministers endeuour is in the best and plainest manner bestowed among them.
            And therefore, I praye God styrre vp the Magistrates hartes to haue more care of this so waighty a matter. And to see their articles concerning this point better executed and put in practise; as well for carelesse and heedlesse, and mindlesse youth, and ignoraunt aged persons; as for negligent Parentes, and Ministers, for the instruction of the one, and discharge of the other.
            
               Thine in the Lord. 
               I. F.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            A very breefe manner of Instruction, to the principles of Religion.
            
               Question.
               WHat meaneth this woord, Catechisme?
            
            
               Aunswer.
               It is as much as to say, a Christian Instruction.
            
            
               Q.
               What is the cheefe part of a Christian mans duetie?
            
            
               A.
               To knowe God.
            
            
               Q.
               By what meanes may we best knowe God?
            
            
               A.
               By his worde, and by his workes.
            
            
               Q.
               By what meanes, is Gods will best made knowne vnto vs?
            
            
               A.
               By these two parts of his word, namelie, the Lawe and the Gospell.
            
            
               Q.
               What learnest thou by the Lawe?
            
            
               A.
               I learne three thinges.
            
            
               Q.
               VVhich be they?
            
            
               A
               First, I learne my miserable, wretched and wofull estate, and my corrupt and most dampnable condicion by nature.
               Secondly, I learne thereby, both what

Gods will is I should doo, and what I ought to doo. And what Gods will is I should not doo, and so, what I ought not to doo.
               Thirdly, I am thereby taught, to flie to Christ for my saluation. Because I see nothing but condemnation in the Law, and the dexteritie, and righteousnesse thereof. And this is the summe and effect of Gods Lawe in generall.
            
            
               Q.
               Shew mee then the breefe sum of Gods Lawe in speciall?
            
            
               A.
               You meane the commaundements of almightie God, that he gaue vnto Moses in the mount.
            
            
               Q.
               Yea the same, how many be there?
            
            
               A.
               There be ten commaundements.
            
            
               Q.
               If you can, I pray you declare them?
            
            
               A.
               Yes that I can, they be the same which God spake in the xx. Chapter of Exodus, saying: Heare O Israel, I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the land of Egipt, out of the house of bondage.

                     1. Thou shalt haue none other Gods but mee.
                     2. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any

grauen Image, nor the lykenesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, nor in the waters vnder the earth, thou shalt not bowe downe to them nor worship them, for I the Lord thy God am a gealous God, and visite the sinnes of the Fathers vpon the chyldren, to the third and sowrth generatiō of them that hate mee: & shew mercie vnto thousandes, in them that loue mee and keepe my commaundements.
                     3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine, for the Lord will not holde him guiltlesse that taketh his name in vaine.
                     4. Remember thou keepe holy the Sabbaoth day: sixe daies shalt thou labour & doo all that thou hast to doo, but the seuēth day is the Sabaoth of the Lord thy God, in it thou shalt doo no manner of worke, thou and thy sonne, and thy daughter, thy man seruant, and thy maide seruant: thy thy cattaile, & the straunger that is within thy gates. For in sixe dayes the Lord made heauen and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seuēth day,

wherfore the Lord blessed the seuenth day and hallowed it.
                     5. Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy dayes may be long in the lande, which the Lord thy God giueth thee.
                     6. Thou shalt doo no murder.
                     7. Thou shalt not commit adulterie.
                     8. Thou shalt not steale.
                     9. Thou shalt not beare false witnesse against thy neighbour.
                     10. Thou shalt not couet thy neighbors house, thou shalt not couet thy neighbors wife, nor his seruaunt, nor his maide, nor his oxe, nor his asse, nor any thing that is his.

               Rehearse them?
            
            
               A.
               1. The sowrth and last cōmaundemēt of the first Table, is commaunded to be done, namely: Remember thou keepe holie the Sabboth day, &c.
               2. So is the fift commaundement, being the first of the second Table, namelie: Honour thy father and thy Mother, &c.

               Q.
               So thou seest how fewe God cōmaunds to doo?
            
            
               A.
               Yea, and yet we doo them not. And how many forbidden, &c. and yet we doo them.
            
            
               Q
               But what learnest thou by this?
            
            
               A.
               I learne and see hereby, two speciall things to be remembred.

                     1. First Gods fatherlie care, loue & goodnesse towardes vs, in both warning vs, and teaching of vs: Both what he would haue done, and what he would not haue done. What we should doo, and what we should not doo.
                     2. Secondly againe, I see first how fraile and vntoward we are, either to doo that he commaundeth, or to forbeare that hee forbiddeth: such is our corrupt and sinful state and naughtie nature, and euill inclined

disposition.
                  
               
            
            
               Q.
               Then thou hast profited somthing hereby.
            
            
               A.
               Yea, I thanke God I know and haue learned, both how gratiously and mercifullie God hath dealt with vs in this, and all other his holy Scriptures. And how far we are from dooing his holy will, and how prone, ready, and foreward we are to doo the contrarie: euen our owne will and heart lusts and delights. And yet by this meanes I hope heereafter by Gods grace, to be put in minde & remembrance to haue more care to doo Gods will, and lesse delight in mine owne will, then euer I had before.
            
            
               Q.
               God graunt it to thee and vs all, to haue such grace for Christes sake.
            
            
               A.
               Amen.
            
            
               Q.
               Seeing we be in such a daungerous state of dampnation, what meanes haue we to obtaine Gods mercie and pardon for our sinnes?
            
            
               A.
               Ouely by faith in Christ Iesus.
            
            
               Q.
               And nothing else but faith?
            
            
               A.
               No, no other thing but faith in Christ, ioyned with true repentaunce & Christiā
                  
loue & charity. And then folowes a zelous minde to the truth, ane a harty and an vnfeined purpose to amend, whatsoeuer is amisse before God and man, &c.
            
            
               Q.
               Rehearse the sum and effect of that faith, perticularly and distinctly.
            
            
               A.
               1. I beleeue in God ye Father almightie, maker of heauen and earth.
               2. And in Iesus Christ his onely sonne our Lord, which was cōceiued by the holy Ghost, borne of the Uirgin Marie, suffered vnder Pontius Pilate, was crucified dead and buried.
               3. He descended into hell.
               4. The third day he rose againe from the dead.
               5. He ascended into heauen, and sitteth on the right hand of God ye Father almighty.
               6. From thence he shall come to iudge the quicke and the dead.
               7. I beleeue in the holie Ghost.
               8. The holie Catholique Church.
               9. The Communion of Saintes.
               10. The forgiuenesse of sinnes.
               11. The resurrection of the body.
               12. And the lyfe euerlasting.
            
            
               
               Q.
               How many Articles be there?

               Q.

               Into three in generall.

                     1. As to God the Father and our creation, by him.
                     2. To God the sonne, and our redemption in him.
                     3. To God the holy Ghost, & our sanctificatiō and regeneration & new birth in him.
                  
               
            
            
               Q.
               Is there any moe diuisions vsed?
            
            
               A.
               Yea, by some two other.
            
            
               Q.
               VVhich be they?
            
            
               A.
               1. One of the Cotholique Church, and the Communion of Saintes.
               2. The other of these three Articles, specially to be noted, as the sum, comfort, and effect of all our faith, &c.
               And they be

                     2 The resurrectiō of ye body.
                     3 And the life euerlasting.
                  
               
            
            
               Q.
               Are these the cheefe partes of our Creede or Articles of our Faith, both generall, speciall and perticular?
            
            
               
               A.
               Yea, this is the summe of our faith in the blessed Trinity, our creation, redemption, and sanctification, and regeneration, and new byrth wrought by Gods spirite, in the hearts of euerie faithfull creature, of the true Church of Christ.
            
            
               Q.
               How is this Faith obtained, encreased, and established?
            
            
               A.
               By three speciall meanes.

                     1. By our humble and heartie Prayer to God.

                     3. By the working of Gods holy spirit in our harts, in hearing of the same word, & receiuing of the same Sacraments, &c.
                  
               
            
            
               Q.
               What is the cheefest prayer, to obtaine all thinges at Gods hand by?
            
            
               A.
               The same which Christ hath taught vs, saying: when you pray, pray on this manner, &c. Luk. II.
               
               O Our Father which art in Heauen.
               1. Halowed be thy name.
               2. Thy kingdome come.

               Yea, that I doo I thanke God, & I giue you thankes also, for your freendly and Christian endeuour. And the Lord giue me grace to vse this prayer and all other, a right. And so hartelie, reuerently, faithfully, and vnfeinedly, as may be to Gods glorie and my comfort.
