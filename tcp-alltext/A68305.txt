               7. The Proteſtant.
               
                  CHRIST, when the deuil did him tempt,
               By Scripture did confute:
               But Papiſtes paſſe on that no leſſe,
               Then Fawkners on Hawkes mute.

               Leaſt halter be your ſhare.

               Idolatrie and adulterie,
               For them you take no care,
