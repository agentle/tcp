            ¶T. N. to the curteous, friendlye,
and indifferent Reader.
            
               AS the Bookes be many, and the deuyſes ſundry,
which now a days in great ſwarmes are
ſent abroade, and publyſhed: ſo lykewyſe,
pregnaunt are the wittes, and rype are the
iudgementes of a great number, which buſyly
beſtow their trauayles, and learnedly lend
the practyſes of their pennes to diſplay, diſcipher, and offer
out to the gazing view of the world, y• ſtore of their cunning,
and the gallauntneſſe of their inuentions: Some tende to
good, and Godly purpoſes: ſome to vayne and tryfeling fantaſyes:
ſome conduce to the aduauncement of vertue & commendation
of the wel deſeruing: ſome to the ſuppreſſing, debelling,
beating downe, and ſubduing of vyce, with a deteſtation
of the loathſome lyfe of the wicked, and the ruynous
end of their peſtiferous dealinges. And Tome (ſhe more pittye)
ſerue altogither to nooriſh wantonneſſe, and mayntayne
laſciuious luſtes. But howſoeuer they deale herein, well I
wot, that they eyther doe, or elſe ought, and ſhould euery one
according to his ability, to further and promote vertue, and
by al conuenyent meanes to rehate loſe lyfe, & to bring vyce
into contempte among all men: the very practiſe whereof,
bringeth deteſtation, and the end wherof bredeth confuſyon.
And becauſe no way ſéemeth ſo redy to exhort, anymate, aduyſe,
and incourage to well doing, neyther any courſe ſo direct
to dehort, terrifye, abaſh, and diſcorage from euill doing,
and eſpecially them of the yonger ſorte (wherein is moſte
daunger, and who yet ſtand tottering and balauncing in the
ſcales of aduyſement, vncertayne which way to wende, or
what path to trace) from the ordinary purſuit of their wilful
affections and inordinate appetites, then by the Examples
of others, that haue trodden the way afore, whoſe ſucceſſe
they may applye to their owne direction: therfore haue many
good Aucthours, both old and new, peculyarlye intituled

their workes by the name and tytle of Examples, Methodically
couched in playne Hiſtoryes: wherein be lyuely patternes
ſet downe & expreſſed, teſtifying what gaynes is gayned
by voluptuous lyfe, and what guerdon enſueth ſenſuall
appetite: wherein as in a Table, is forcibly delineated, how
ſome for vertue, haue ryſen to honour, fame, dignitie, and
renowne, and ſome for vyce haue bene throwne downe, and
buryed in the pit of diſhonour, ſhame, reproch, and eternall
infamy. So that the worthy aduancement of the one, maye
be a ſharp ſpurre to ſtyrre vp to goodneſſe, and the lothſome
beaſtlyneſſe of the other, a brydle to reine our appetytes frō
theſe inconueniences, wherein we ſée them to haue bene for
their demerytes, condignly plunged, to y• open ouerthrowes
of their preſent eſtates, and obloquious ſtayn to all their poſteritie.
For certaynelye the view and conſideration of the
accidentes that haue dryuen others (for notoryous enormyties
committed, and loſe lyfe lewdely lead,) vpon the rufull
rockes, and ſandy ſhelues of lamentale loſſe, and doleful decaye,
is in my opynyon a good document for vs to beware of
ſemblable folly, & to kéepe our ſelues within the preſcripte
boundes of modeſt behauyour. To this ende Hyſtoryes and
Pamphlets, as well of the good ſucceſſe of well doers, as of
the ill happes of the wicked, doe generally tend
                  •
                and purpoſely
ſerue, and are alyke expedient, ſo that they be ſimply
interpreted, and rightly applyed. In the number of whiche
well meanyng wryters, I dare to enrole the wryter, and
tranſlator of theſe preſent Hyſtoryes, & Tragicall troubles,
out of French, into this our Engliſh tongue, meaning not
hereby to open any moe wyndowes, to vnſtayed youth,
whereby to egge them to ſpende their golden tyme, in peruſing
peeuiſh, paltring, and poyſonous Pamphlets, and ſo to
corrupte their vnſetled diſpoſitions, but by modeſte and
ſeaſonable aduertiſementes, to reclayme their fonde fyckle
fantaſyes, and to quallifye their vntemperate and headye
humours. For the bringing of which matter to better paſſe,
the penner hereof, thought himſelf to haue taken a good and
direct courſe, by enterlacing pleaſure with profyte, and by

reducing the ground of his conceyued meaning, into a méete
Methode of Hiſtorycal occurrence. And for that it is none of
the leaſt part of mercy, to father the Fatherleſſe, and protect
the pore Orphane, from the gréedy iawes of rauenous rakers,
I haue héere reſtored to him his due, and ſet forth hys
trauayle euen as he lefte it, without any iniury eyther to his
perſon, or any iot gelding his honeſt and painful endeuours:
for I accoumpt it no good dealing, that any mā ſhould thruſt
his lyeth into an others Harueſt, or lyke Eſopes Crow to vſurpe
and iette abroade, deckte with the Feathers of
other bewtifuller Byrds: or to haue ſuch a tyckling ytche,
or rather ſcabbe of vaynegloryous fame, to arrogate that to
himſelfe, which an other mans toyle hath enterpryſed and
brought to paſſe. Beſéeching thée gētle Reader to accept wel
in worth this prety Pamplet, little (I confeſſe) in bulk, but
fraught with ſuch matter, as may, if thou wilt, yéeld thée good
& wholeſome inſtruction: which as it now perchaūce lacketh
not here and there his imperfections, ſo (had God lent to the
Authour longer lyfe) would haue bene better poolyſhed, & as
voyde of faults and eſcapes in the prynting, as his mynd
was frée frō iuſtly giuing occaſiō of offēce to any. Which
courteſye, if (accordingly) there appeare to remayne
wythin thee, then (doubtleſſe) is his
paynes fully rewarded, and my expectation
ſuffycyentlye ſatyſfyed.
            Farewell.

and Lamentable Tragicall
Hiſtoryes.
            
               ¶A iuſt Fact, but to cruell, of Iohn Maria, Duke of
Myllayne, towarde a Prieſt extreme couetous.
               
                  
                     IOhn Maria Vicont, ſonne
of Iohn Galeas, vnto whome the
Emperour Ladiſilaus gaue the
tytle and name of Duke of Myllayne,
was he that ſucceeding in
the eſtate and dignity of Duke, made himſelfe
knowne and renowned, before all the Princes
of his tyme: not in ſhewing himſelfe more vertuous
then they, or in ſurpaſſing the good Fortune
of that good Galeas his Father, who I
thinke neuer committed any other notable euill,
then that he lefte behynde him a plague ſo
great and daungerous as his ſonne, the ſucceſſyon
of whome, was no more fortunate for the
Milinois, then was once the Romayne Monarch
of Marcus Aurelius, leauing for the inheritour
of the Empyre, that Butcher▪ and

Sworde player Commodus, a lyuelye example
of creweltye and miſchiefe, and
truelye hys Countrey myghte well haue
coniectured their Miſfortune, in that Iohn
Maria was called to the Dignitye of the
Dukedome, after that all Italye had ſeene
the Orygynall of the Ciuill warres ſo often
wrytten of by the Hyſtoryans, whiche ſo
muche weakened the ſtrength of Italye, and
abaſed the glorye of thoſe thinges whiche
remayned to them, as Reliques eſcaped
from the handes of ſo manye Barbaryans
and Straungers, that hadde foyled
with their fe
                     •
                  te, the honour of that Godlye
Prouynce, for it was after that the
Guelfes and Gibilines had throughlye deuyded
themſelues, leauyng no corner of
Italye, that was notte Dyed wyth the
bloud of the poore Cittizens, and was it not
pittyfull, to ſee the Nobillitye chaſed and
wandring abroade, there beyng no creature
that felte not thys Tempeſte, and
whyche perceyued not the vehemencye of a
deuyſyon ſo furyo
                     •
                  s, ſo that all Natyons
of Europe, had their acceſſe to make their
Rodes into Italye, and there to pyll the
Cittyes, and Fertyle Fyeldes, called into
the country, eyther by the one or the other of
the Factions.
               
                  
But this Duke was renowned for the
moſte cruell and inhumayne Tyraunte, that
euer was nouryſhed in Chriſtendome, and
I beleeue that Bucyrus Phalaris, or that
Thracian King which foſtred his Horſes with
the bodyes of the dead, did neuer ſurpaſſe him
in crueltye, and although his Prediceſſoures
had bene Princes, very mercifull, and gentle,
and that by their modeſtye, they had attayned
to the place of ſuche Prehemynence, yet this is
he which forgetting the houſe wherof he came,
did degenerate from the bloud of his Anceſtours,
being deſpightfull, for that Fortune had
bene otherwyſe to him, then ſhe had bene towardes
that excellent Iohn Galeas his Father,
and to Valentyne that was Wyfe
to the Duke of Orleans, ſhee whych was
ſlayne at Paris, by the Duke of Burgoyne
his men, doeth ſo accarnate hymſelfe, that
hee cauſed to be deuoured in his preſence, by
Maſtyfes broughte vp to that ende, thoſe
whyche for the leaſte occaſyon that hee fantaſyed
in his mynde, dydde diſpleaſe hym,
hauyng for the Mynyſter of hys crueltye,
and in ſteade of Proueſt Marſhall,
a Gentleman named, Squarce Gyrame,
as courteous as hys Lorde, and
who in the ende was alſo payde wyth
the ſame paymente, as was hys Mayſter,

being both togyther as cruelly ſlayne, as
vnpittifull they had fleſhed themſelues vppon
the myſerable people of Millayne, during the
tyme then that this incorporate Deuill reioyſeth
himſelfe, and ſheweth theſe tragicall and
deteſtable actes of hys cruell lyfe, this thing
chaunced which I am now about to deſcrybe
vnto you, to the ende you may beholde the two
great and extreame vyces, the one of Auaryce
in a Prieſt, and the other of the crueltie, of the
Duke. Iohn Maria ryding one day thorough
his Cittye, as commonly he did, not onely for to
beholde the faultes of his ſubiectes, but more to
ſearch out if any one durſt complayn of the deteſtable
maners of his lyfe, and the very hauty
and tyrannical doings of his raygn, to the end
he might ſeeme to haue ſome reaſon to tormēt
him, that ſhoulde complayne without cauſe of
his Lord, that as yet had giuen him no occaſyon:
Thus as he made theſe Iorneys, he hard a
farre of, a great crye, and the voyce of a woman
complayning, who clapping her hands,
did eleuate her voyce verye high, thinking
that GOD was deafe, and that he will not
heare our neceſſityes, without ſuch a ſturre, to
whome he ſent one of his ſeruaunts, to know
the cauſe of a crye ſo fearefull, who found it at
thedore of a pore woman, whoſe huſband was
lately deceaſed, that thus complayned, as well
for the loſſe of her companyon, as alſo for that

ſhee had not wherewith to bring him to the
earth. Alas, ſayth the woman (half deſperate)
whether may the pore haue their recourſe? ſyth
the very Church hath denyde their duetyes to
them, vnto whome they be bounde, to whome
may I adreſſe my ſelfe? not hauing wherewith
to ſatiſfye, or glent the deſyre of my vnſatiable
Curat, that is neyther content with the gayns
which he hath, ſuffring this body without life,
to remayne without Sepulture, onely for the
herytage of all the goods whiche he hath lefte
me in this world for my comforte, for if I wyll
haue him interred, of neceſſitye I muſt ſell all
my moueables, and afterwards not knowing
how to relieue my Infantes. Ah falſe Paſtor,
I beſeech God to puniſh with ſome great perſecution,
both thee and them which are of lyke
condicions, ſaying ſo, with cryes, teares, ſobs,
and ſighes, ſhe pardoneth not her own cheekes
and face, but ſcratcheth the one, ſhe bepaynteth
the others, ſtryking herſelfe vpon the ſtomack,
and ſhewing dyuers other ſygnes of a woman
diſtraught, the Dukes man ſeeing her to ſhew
ſuch faſhyons, addreſt him towardes her, ſaying:
My friende, what wrong is this that is
done to you, and wherefore ſhew you ſo great
dule? tell me, becauſe I may make the reporte
to my Lord, who hath ſent me hyther to know
the matter, and aſſure your ſelf, if any one hath
offended you, he will extend ſuch Iuſtice, that

you ſhall be contente and ſatiſfyed, and the authoures
ſhall haue whereof to take example,
and withholden to doe iniurye to the poore
in ſuche a Towne as thys, where the
Lorde wyll that Iuſtyce be done to euery one,
without reſpecte of eſtate.
               The woman who knewe by his Lyuerye,
that hee was one of the Dukes Seruauntes,
whoſe preſence although it were not verye
agreeable vnto her, in thynking that hee
came there but onelye to ſeeke ſome praye, yet
not fearing anye worſe aduenture then her
owne, nor anye Fortune more frowarde
then the eſtate wherein ſhee was, and alſo
for that death to her woulde haue bene great
ſolace, ioying alſo that the Offycer had talked
vnto her ſo gentlye, aunſwereth him in
thys ſorte.
               Alas Syr, beholde there the deade bodye
of my Huſbande, which the Prieſte of thys
Parriſhe hath refuſed to burye, for that I
haue not wherewith to ſatiſfye him for his
payne, and to content him for the Funerals.
This is the occaſyon why I torment my ſelfe,
not knowing how I maye interre the deade
Corpes, the onely memorye whereof, hath
made mee ſo full of ſorrowe and dule, and
to ſhowe before your eyes this outrage. The
Duke which this ſpace attended to know the

occaſyon of this crye, vnto whome his man being
retourned, ſayth: My Lorde, in this houſe
before you, is a poore woman, inuyroned
wyth ſmall Chyldren, (whoſe Huſbande thys
morning being dead), hath deſyred the Prieſt
to burye the bodye of the deade, but hee vnleſſe
ſhee will paye the interrage, and the accuſtomed
Funeralles, hath vtterlye denyed
her to goe aboute it, wherefore ſhee maketh
this noyſe, not hauing wherewith to doe
it, and furthermore, if ſhee ſhoulde ſell
her mooueables, ſhee hath not wherewyth
then to bring vp her ſmall Infantes.
               Iohn Maria hearing him tell of a Facte
ſo Vylonyous, and of a couetouſneſſe ſo deteſtable,
began to laugh, whoſe laughter was
a prognoſtication of the teares of ſome man.
Then tourning to them of hys Trayne, hee
ſayth.
               Truely this mayſter Curate is very vncharitable,
and greatly giuen to his owne profyte,
ſo to denye his helpe to them that requyre him,
ſyth that it is his duety, and hee is hyred to
doe it. Therefore it is good that I ſhewe him
the waye, and excercyſe our Charitye in this,
cauſing this body to be intombed, and then to
extende our almes to this woman, that
lamenteth as well for her owne loſſe, as

for that ſhee beholdeth her ſelfe charged wyth
Infantes, and not knowing howe to keepe
them, ſhoulde not this be well done? ſayeth he
to his Gentlemen: Truely my Lorde aunſwereth
one of the trayne, this acte would bee as
greatly prayſed, as any good deede that you
can doe in this worlde, and eſpecially for that
your excellencye in forgetting your Nobillity,
ſhall ſo much abaſe your ſelfe, as to accompany
the moſt pore to the earth, and to ſuccour their
widdowes, although they neuer did you anye
ſeruyce: Let vs go then (ſayth the Duke,) the
Prieſt as it may be, will doe his duetye to this
partye, at my deſyre, wherefore I will giue
him ſuch a Salary for his paynes, as all hys
lyfe after, he ſhall not haue cauſe to complaine:
He ſayth this, thinking ſo well to chaſten the
Prieſt, that from thence forth he ſhoulde make
no more ſuch refuſals, commanding then, that
he which had bene firſt at the houſe of the widdowe,
ſhould go for the Curate to come talke
with the Duke, for a matter of great importaunce.
The mayſter Chaplen which thought
of nothing leſſe, then the fault which he had
done, and remembred not at all of the dead, the
corpes of whome, remayned without Sepulture,
came ſodaynly to the Dukes preſence,
whome after the Duke had wel beholden, and
ſeeing him fat, groſſe in euery poynt, and cloathed
in rich Apparell, was not abaſhed at all

of the refuſal that he had made to the pore woman,
as well for his well lyking, whereby hee
ſhewed that one hower of pleaſure, was an
hundered tymes more agreable vnto him, then
a thouſand yeres of ſeruitude, and that alſo to
nouriſh ſuch a belly, it was needefull to haue
more gaynes, then roſe of his cure, hauing his
Vyſage more lyke the picture of ſome ſwollen
Bacchus, then of one profeſſing the ſtudye of
diuinitie, fynally this Prieſt did not vary at all
from the moſte parte of them, that at this daye
to the great domage of all Chriſtendome, haue
entered into the Miniſtery, who thinke that
they haue done their duety, in making a feaſt
or dinner to their equalles, without remembring
the reſt of their office, neyther to viſyte
the poore, nor to ſuccour them, according to the
ſtatutes, and ordinaunces of the holy Canons,
ordayned by the generall and ſacred counſels,
but are become feeders of their owne bellyes,
and dumme dogges, ſo that the onely name of
Prieſthood ought to ſhadowe them, and ſuffyce
as they imagyne, wythout neceſſitie to
put their hand to the worke, and to ſatiſfye by
effect, that for which they be called. Our Curate
then bolde and aſſured, preſenteth hymſelf
to Iohn Maria, ſaying: My Lord, it hath
pleaſed your excellency to commaunde mee to
come before you, may it alſo pleaſe you to ſhew
me the thing wherein you wyll imploy me, in

which I will obey you, as he that deſireth nothing
but to ſerue and pleaſe you. The wyly
and ſubtle Lord, ſeeyng the fayned curteſy and
pleaſant words of the ſyr Iohn, begā to laugh,
and to mocke him with his glory, and to deteſt
his impudent auaryce, anſwering him: I haue
ſent for you to the ende you ſhould cauſe to bee
brought to the earth, that poore man which is
one of your pariſhioners, & I will giue you the
rewarde and Salary that you merite, for it is
neyther iuſt nor meete that ſuch a man as you,
ſhould be imployed without recompence. Pardone
mee my Lord ſayth the Prieſt, your only
commandement deth ſuffyce, & your grace holdeth
the place of al ſatyſfaction: Wel, wel, ſayeth
the Duke, I accept all that you haue ſayd,
and beleeue that you woulde doe more for mee
then this, ſyth at this tyme I ſee you ſo preſte
to doe your duety in this afayre, therefore goe
prepare your ſelfe, for I will aſſiſt you at the
obſequies, aſſuring you, that you ſhalbe recompenced
before I depart, as I intend, and according
to your deſartes.
               Now the Chaplayne, which thought that he
was already placed in the office of the Dukes
Almoner, verye pleaſaunte and merrye departeth
towardes his Church, where hee ſetteth
all thinges in order, and ſendeth for a good
companye of Prieſtes and others, whych ſerued
ordinarilye in the Churches, becauſe hee

would with more greater pompe, and honour
accompany the Corpes, for which the Duke
had ſo deſyred him.
               But the myſerable Prieſt ſawe not, that
was the Trayne whyche Fortune had ordayned
for him, and howe neare the hower dyd
approache, in which he muſt paye the arr
                     •
                  rages
of his afore paſſed lyfe, and aboue all that
great and vyle ſynne of cruell Auaryce, by an
other crueltye the moſte ſtraunge that hath
beene hearde of, and I am abaſhed, howe he
ſhould be ſo far beſide his wyt, that ſeeing the
fault which he had committed, & knowing the
nature of his Lord, himſelf hearing him ſpeake
ſo doubtfully, and with wordes ſmelling more
of his choller then gentleneſſe, how he durſte
retourne and repreſent himſelfe agayne before
the furyous face of his Prince: But what? he
was ſo blynded with Auaryce, and led withthe
deſyre of Money, that euerye looke ſeemed
vnto hym curteous, and euery word pleaſaunte,
ſyth the talke of gayne and recompence
marched therewyth.A cruell cuſtome of the Duke of Millayne. The vnhappye
Prieſte had 
                     •
                  orgotten that the Duke for the
leaſte occaſyon that myghte bee, cauſed
to bee dyſmembered wyth hys Dogges, men
women, and chyldren, wythoute hauyng regarde
eyther to Sex or Age, ſo vnnaturall
and cruell weare hys condycyons.
What? oughte hee to hope of more gentleneſſe

and humanitie, then an infynite number
of the Citizens of Millayn, the death of whom
ſerued for a paſtyme to the rage of this cruell
Duke. What thought he to fynd him more religyous
towards him? then iuſt to them whoſe
innocencye had made them vnworthye of all
puniſhment. Alas, although he had rendred
Boloigna the great vnto the Pope, and that
he had humbled himſelfe to the Apoſtolicall
ſeate very mekely, yet this was more for feare
and imbecillitie, then for the affection that hee
had to religyon, for it is vnpoſſible that ſuch a
Barbarous and cruel Tyraunt, ſhould eyther
honour or reuerence God, or that he ſhould acknowledge
anye thing that toucheth the reſpect
of Religion, witneſſe of this was once
that Tyraunt Denis of Sciſcill, after that he mocked
and reioyced at the ſacriledge & crueltye,
making no conſcience to pill and rob the Temples,
for theſe contemners fayne all gentlenes
and diſſemble to haue their myndes full of all
deuotion and holyneſſe: But you ſee by effecte
to what ende tendeth their ſymplicity, and it
is the honour and feare of God that pricketh
and mooueth them to ſome reuerence, leauing
this diſcourſe, we will retourne agayne to our
Prieſt, who cauſed to be caryed the moſt fayre
and riche Croſſe of his Churche, prouyding
Clarks to carry the Corpes, and vſing ſuche
diligence, as if he had bene the moſte ryche Vſurer

of al the banquers of Lombardy, and not
forgetting to couer him with the moſt rych couering
of his Church.
               The Duke hearing the iangling and noyſe
of the Belles, could not refrayne from laughter,
ſaying: By God Mayſter Curat you ſhow
well the greedy appetyte of you auaryce, ſyth
the dead carcaſes doe ſo diſpleaſe you without
offence, I will gyue you ſuch a reward as ſhal
remayne in memory here this hundred yeres:
His men by theſe wordes perceyued well that
the Duke had deuyſed ſomewhat agaynſt the
Curat, & aſſured themſelues ſeeing his countenaunce,
which the Prieſt feared as much as
death: But behold now the Chaplayne wyth
his company, came and ſung the Ambroſyan
Vygils, before the doore of the dead, to whom
the Duke was aſſiſtaunte, and hearde wyth
pacyence and good deuotyon, the Durge ſung
for the dead, which he behelde gladly then, for
one that accompanyed him, during this ſtyrre
he gaue commandement to the graue makers,
that they ſhoulde make the graue verye deepe
and large, without telling why ſo, of whome
he was obayed, for that they knewe the commaunder,
who was wel known in his Dukedome,
more for feare, then loue that any of hys
Subiects bare him, for that is very true which
is commonly ſayd, that men hate him deadly,
whome they feare, the ſeruice being ended in

the Church, there was great Funerall pompe
ſhewed in going to the Churchyarde, to fyniſh
the Obſequyes, that yet before the bodye was
put into the earth, they ſong Pſalmes, and
other Prayers, in ſuche a caſe accuſtomed,
where the Prieſte obſerued ſuche a grauytye
and reuerence in hys Ceremonyes, that hee
himſelfe could ſcarce forbeare the pleaſure that
he receyued of his well doing. But beholde
here the laſt acte of the Tragedye, for as ſoone
as all was fyniſhed,Hor

                     eaſe vpon dead bodyes. and that the Prieſte had
caſt holy water vpon the dead body, leauyng
the office to put him into the earth, to them that
had the charge thereof, which began ſtrayght
wayes to fulfyll the laſt Ceremonye of the buryall,
then the Duke calleth vnto them, ſaying:
That they muſte attende, for as yet all
the Ceremonyes of the Funerall were not perfyte,
for he woulde honoure the deade wyth
ſome thing otherwyſe, then they thoughte of,
all men were aſtonyed at thys newe acte of
the Duke, and moreouer becauſe he addreſſeth
him towardes the Prieſte, with his face inſlamed
wyth choler, and a voyce repreſenting his
fury, ſaying: Chaplayn, if thy Auarice did not
render thee more infamous then the reſt of thy
hypocriticall lyfe, doth giue the good renowne,
I ſhould haue ſome occaſyon to diſſemble thy

                  , I will pay thee preſentlye according
to the merytes of thy charitye, whyche
being ſpoken, hee tourneth him towardes
them that woulde haue put the Corſe into the
Graue, to whome he vſeth theſe, or lyke
words: For as muche as this Prieſt beeing alyue,
woulde not accompanye the deade to the

to the end that the preſence of the prieſt,
being in this apparell that he is, may make
them welcome among the Deuils, when they
muſt paſſe by the chambers of hel, al the world
as I haue ſaid, were ſo aſtonyed of the beaſtly
maners and great crueltye of the Duke, that
the graue makers obeying his commandmēt,
tooke the Prieſte and bounde him ſtraightlye
face to face, & mouth agaynſt mouth, with the
carcaſe of the deade, a cruelty truely extreme
great & deteſtable, although that the vice of the
Churchman was worthy of puniſhmente, but
not after this faſhyon, nor with deth, as he puniſhed
his offence, what ſhould one expecte at
his hand
                     •
                   that remembreth no other Iuſtice,
then that he fantaſyeth in wicked and tyrannicall

mynde, and what reaſon ſhould one loke
for of him, that deteſteth all law, and remembereth
no goodneſſe at all, hauing no law, but
his own wyll, nor other mercy then that which
endeth with cruell Butchery, hauing no leſſe
pleaſure then Caligula had to ſee ſlaughter,
ruine, and effuſyon of bloud: When the reſt of
the Clergye ſaw him intreate the prieſt of this
ſorte, fearing that the fury of the Duke would
perſue all the companye in lyke order, they
threw downe the Croſſe, the Sprinckle, & holy
water Tankarde, and lefte the Tapers, to
take their feete, & ſaue them from the rage of
the Tyraunte, who ſeeing them run out of the
Churchyard ſo afearde, and wythout order,
could not hold himſelf from laughter, although
on the other ſyde, he hearde the dolorous voyce
of the myſerable Chapleyn, that they were about
to put quick into the earth. Alas my Lord
(ſayeth he) haue compaſſyon on me vnhappye
wyght, that ſo humblye requyre you of pardon
for my fault, and which promyſe neuer to offend
you more, & to recompence the widdowe
for the ſmall pittie I ſhewed vnto her. What
arte thou no more bolde (ſayeth Iohn Maria,
being ſo vnpittifull) that thou arte afearde of
the ſhadowes of them that floate on the Ryuer
of Death, and forgetfulneſſe, take thou no care
for the Wyddow, I haue already better prouided
for her, then thou haſte for thy affayres.

Therefore calleth hee to the others, that they
ſhoulde diſpatch, that the good Synger ſhould
not trouble him any more with his prayers, thē
all at once they began to laye downe the two
bodyes, to couer them with earth, when as the
Prieſt cryed. Alas my Lorde, if you haue no
pitty of the bodye, yet haue compaſſyon of the
ſaluation of the ſoule, as much as is in your
power, and ſuffer me not to dye, without confeſſing
my faultes, before ſome Miniſter of
God, according to the inſtitution of the church.
Go, go, ſayth the Duke, thou hadſt more neede
to appeaſe the Porter of Hell with thy Orations,
ſynce thou canſt not get a Prieſt at thys
preſent, they be all fled away from thee, ſeeing
thee already conuerted into a nightſpright, to
afray Children in the Churchyarde, and therfore
thou ſhalte be put into the earth, with the
abſolucyon that thou haſte, geue him whom
thou imbraceſt, that may ſerue for the alegeance
of the heape of all thy offences. Wyth
ſuch rayling, the inhumayn Prince cauſed the
two bodyes to be caſt into the pit, with no leſſe
abaſhment of al men, then as a thing that they
had neuer ſeene done before, which thoughte
not that the Duke ſo vnaduyſedly, and of ſuch
a beaſtly maner would haue put men to deth,
but his lyfe was no leſſe deteſtable, then the
lyfe of the Emperour Macryne, who vſed
lyke manners, and puniſhed more cruelly then

he did, ſyth the Prieſte was preſt and choked,
as well by the ſmell of the dead bodye, as by
the earth that was caſt vppon him, the graue
being verye deepe, whereas the Emperour
wythout pyttye, cauſed ſuch as hee had condemned,
to bee bounde lykewyſe to the deade
carcaſes that putrifyed the Ayre, not ſuffering
them to be buryed, but let them ſo remayne
till that eyther by fayntneſſe, or ſtinche of the
dead body, and the multitude of Vermyn, they
cruelly departed out of this lyfe. Nor more
curteous was Maximiniam, who cauſed ſuch
as he hated to be thruſt into the empty belly of
an Oxe, vnto the head, where they ended their
miſery by y• blood that ran out of the beaſt, but
the barbarous tyme, doth excuſe theſe Gallāts
that being Panims, and without knowledge
of God, which are not ſo much to be maruailed
at, if they did their workes acording to the deſyre
of the deuill that was their guyde, who is
a murderer from the beginning, but a chriſtyan
Prynce come of a good ſtocke, broughte vp
amongeſt men of learning, and dwelling in ſo
ciuill a Countrey ought to make the caſe more
ſtraunge, ſyth that the earth once cryed vengeaunce
to GOD vppon Cayne, for that hee
had vyolated the Bright of kynred, in ſleaing
that iuſt Abell his Brother, I beleeue that
within a little tyme after, Iohn Maria for ſo
pernicious a cryme, was ſlayne by his owne

Cittizens, and I thinke that in our tyme there
be ſome that haue made ſacryfyce of heads, &
other members, & who lyke Diomedes haue
cauſed their Horſes to eate the bodyes of men.
But I beleeue that God will not leaue ſuche
crueltyes vnpuniſhed, although for a whyle he
attendeth and is pacyent in his doinges, yet
in the end he wil cauſe thē to feele the ſtrength
of his arme, and to feele the inuytable yre of
his iuſt diſpleaſure.
               Now to retourne to the matter, the Duke
hauing accomplyſhed theſe Tragical, and ſorrowful
Funerals, he diſpatched ſodenly one of
his men to the houſe of the Prieſt, from whēce
he cauſed all his moueables to be caryed, and
giuen to the poore wyddow, the wyfe of hym
that was dead, with whome the Prieſt was
companyon in the graue. This laſt ſentence
was as iuſt, as the fyrſt was vniuſt, cruell,
and horrible, ſyth it was good reaſon that he
ſhould be puniſhed in hys goods, that for A
                  
                     •
                  aryce
and deſyre of Money, had forgotten
hymſelfe, and the duety requyſyte in a publique
man, ſuch a one as is the Paſtoure of a
Churche, bee not offended, (you that beare
the Eccleſyaſticall Offyces) of that whyche
I haue ſayde, but take Example by the
myſerable ende of one of your eſtate, thinking
that the perſecutions and the euill that
God hath ſēt you, procedeth of your ambicion,

auaryce, ignorance, and whoredome, I tel you
truly, I am ſorry for that the aduerſarye of the
Church ſuppreſſeth the good men, & throweth
down them that ought to be honored, wheras
the fooliſh, the ſlow bellyes, the ignorant, & the
whoremōgers feele no ſuch ſcourges, but God
which is iuſt, hath by theſe meanes called you
to repentaunce, becauſe you ſhould acknowledge
your faultes, and lyue more Godly then
the Abbot Guenſaldo,The Hyſtory of whome is already ſet forth excellently by Mayſter Fenton. and this myſerable
Myſer, intreated ſo cruelly by the
moſte deteſtable tyraunt that euer
was ſeene in Italy, ſynce the
Lombardes gaue the
name to that
Lande.

               FINIS.
            
            
               
               ¶A Gentleman Myllinois beeing
amorous at the very end of his age,
for the extreame Ieloſy of his Concubyne, was cauſe
of the death of his Sonne and of himſelfe, and laſtly of
the vnhappy ende of the Harlot, whiche was cauſe
of all.
               
                  
                     AT the time when the french
armies were diſcouered throughout
Italy, for the Conqueſt of
Myllayne, cauſing all the ſtate
of the Venetians to tremble▪ when Lewis the
ſeuenth had brought his affayres in ſuch readynes,
that he pitched his Campe euen in the
ſight of their next Citie, breaking down their
walles, and ouerthrowing with the force of
his Canons their Towers of defence, that
Venis neuer felte any greater, or more mightyer
force.
               The Venetians not knowing howe, or by
what meanes to quyet their bondes, and to
appeaſe the diſpleaſure of a King, iuſtly incenſed
agaynſte their infydelitie and arrogancie,
about that tyme (I ſaye) there was a Gentleman
Milinois, which for the troubles cōming,
doth conuay himſelfe to a Caſtle, that hee had
before Monſe, as lykewyſe did the moſte parte
of them that coulde not brooke the chaunging

of their Lord, or who (as it might bee) were
not able to indure the inſolencye, and crueltye
of the French Souldyers.
               This Gentleman of whome I intreate,
was a Wyddower, to whome there was remayning
onely two chyldren, the one of the
Age of ſeuen or eyghte yeares, the other
approaching neare to the age of twentye, the
olde man ſeeing hymſelfe wythoute a wyfe,
although hee hadde almoſte paſſed the age
of threeſcore yeares, neyther hauing regarde
to hys Age, nor to hys approaching death,
doeth become amorous of a gyrle, the Daughter
of a Meſſenger, both fayre and well fauoured,
of whome hee had his pleaſure, by
the meanes of the onely Father of the Gyrle,
which ſolde her vnto him.
               This is a marke very certayne, to bewayle
any man, which we ſee in his age to become a
Father, whoſe youth hath geuen him no
ſygne thereof, yet thys is moſte deteſtable
that Chryſtyans beare the iniquitie of Fathers
and Mothers, ſo impudente and euill,
as to ſell, proſtytute, and corrupte their
owne Daughters, and commonly the Maieſtrates
of our tyme wyll ſee nothing, the
Kinges ſhutte their eyes, they that fayne them
ſelues to be moſt holy of all the reſt, take ſome
Golden gyfte to heare the Chaſtitye ſoulde

                     •
                  or bargayned ſommes, and there is not one

amongeſt them all, which puniſheth this marchandyſe
of bodyes, waſhed by the bloud of
him, that through the pryce of hys lyfe hath redeemed
vs out of the handes of hym, whyche
helde vs in bondage, wherefore the Gentiles
and Infydels of tyme paſte, doe exceede
and vanquiſh vs in Iuſtice and polliticke doinges,
more right then oures, that they haue
thereby attayned the glory of puniſhing faults
whyche we behold, endure, and approue, and
as executers therof, do glory and prayſe them.
Vnhappy ſurely is ye world, where vyce beres
the name of Iuſtyce, and Iniquitye is prayſed
as a vertue, infortunate is the place where
ſuch fauoure is ſhewed to the wicked, that
their infamye is ſuſtayned, and approoued
by the moſte mightye. But the wycked
doe not remember at all, that GOD is in
Heauen, regarding and beholding the deedes
of men, for to doe Iuſtice one daye, by the
ſtrength of his hande, and the inuytable
force of his ſcourges, by whyche (wythout
exceptynge of perſons) hee indyfferentlye
doeth puniſhe both the faulte of the offender,
and of him that fayleth to execute the aucthoritye,
and the ſworde that God hath put into
his handes. But nowe to retourne to our
former matter, thys verye lybydynous
and wanton olde man, keeping this Gyrle
at bed and boorde in his Caſtle, lying ordinarily

with her, and chafeth the cold & vnhappy
fleſhe of the vyle Mountayn Satyre, that
ſeketh to contynue that whiche nature doeth
deny him, and aſſayeth to ouercome his own
force. The eldeſt ſonne ſeeing the diſhoneſty of
his father, was ſad beyonde all meaſure, vſing
neuertheleſſe ſuch a modeſtye and vertuous
diſſimulation, becauſe he would not make ſorrowfull
his father, that hee ſhewed a better
countenaunce to the Palyarde, then he coulde
well, whome he hated to the death, as well for
that ſhe was ſuch a one, as for that he knewe
ſhe would be the ruine and ſhortning of the life
of the vnhappy olde man, and alſo for that hee
ſaw her ſo fonde and vnſhamefaſt, that one
mighte eaſilye iudge by her, ſhe would not refuſe
the intertayning of another Captayne,
which might furniſh her ſomewhat better, for
the old man doth ſerue onely for the increaſing
and prouocation of her ſenſualitie, without
power at anye tyme to contente the immoderate
wantonneſſe, that burned within her
mynde, and therfore ſhe thinketh to practyſe a
combate more luſtye and of better hope, which
ſhe did, becauſe the olde man was not able to
ſuffice her: Ah inſaciable deſyres, and depth
not to be fylled, that is the wantonneſſe of an
harlot, what deteſtable euils haue chaunced
by theſe loues, to them that without all ſhame,
haue put all their glory and pleaſure in the delightes

and flatteryes of the worlde, onely
Sampſon, Salomon, and Hercules may giue
ſure teſtimony. Now this gyrle as we ſayd before,
feeling the dimiſſing of the forces of her
louer, doth deliberate to purſue another pray,
therefore ſhe impudently caſteth her lookes on
the ſonne of the Gentleman, and in becōming
Amorous, ſhee purpoſeth, if it be poſſyble, to
make him the Liefetenaunt, and ayde of hys
Father, and this ſhe doth not for anye curteſy
that was hid vnder the Haggard and ruſtick
nature, and bringing vp of the rude countrey,
but for that ſhe ſaw the yong man fayre, well
proporcyoned of his members, and for that ſhe
iudgeth him apte to performe the Chaſe, in
which his father was able to giue but ſymple
attemptes, ſodaynly ſhee ſeaſeth from her enterpryſe,
as do the yong Louers, not experte or
able ynough to detayne their pray, by and by
agayne, ſhe goeth about to ſhew him al friendſhip,
and familiaritie that ſhe coulde, and often
tymes ſhe ſeeketh hym, fynding him at his
boke, where ſhe ſheweth euidently the deſyres
that cauſe her to purſue him. But the good
chyld, neuer thought of ſuch a wickedneſſe, as
well to be chaſte of his nature, as for the feare
of God, and offending of his father, and for
that as yet, hee had neuer bene kyndled wyth
loue, nor taken in the trap of worldlye follyes:
But the Concubyne perceyuing that ſhee trauayled

in vayn, thinking to make him vnderſtand
her deſyres by ſygnes, doeth deliberate,
(as ſoone as occaſyon ſhoulde be offered) to
manyfeſt it vnto him by worde, which ſhe dyd
one day, his Father being gone to ſee one of
his neighboures, and before ſhe would aſſaulte
the yong man, ſhee doeth inſtructe
in that myſchiefe a Chambermayd her Coſen,
to the end that when her perſwaſyons ſhould
fayle, the other myghte ſupplye her wante,
as ſoone as theſe eloquente Ieayes hadde
prepared themſelues, they wente to ſeeke
the Gentleman, whome they founde recreatyng
himſelfe in the myddeſt of a great
Chamber, the fayre Forreſt Nymphe, aſſyſted
wyth the keeper of her bed, began to ſaye vnto
him. I knowe not ſyr what to thynke of
you, or to make of your doinges, whiche loued
and deſyred of any, doe not accoumpte it your
parte to recompence them with lyke affections,
whyche deſyre your acquayntaunce, I
thinke ſurely that you are not ſo colde, that
your hart is not to be attached with any amorous
paſſyon, nor I eſteeme you ſo frowarde
that if any fayre dame of what ſtate ſoeuer ſhe
were, would geue you power to cōmand, you
would be able to abandon and refuſe her. To
what purpoſe ſaye you this? aunſwereth h
                     •
                  ,
haue you ſeene in mee any ſygne of rudeneſſe
or diſcourteſye towardes any woman that

lyues? I ſweare vnto you that if vnwittingly
I haue committed this faulte, for a faulte requyres
but amendes. She which thoughte to
haue holy gayned, and to imbrace him already
within her armes, began to weepe verye tenderly,
in ſaying: Alas ſyr, I know one yt would
think her the moſt hapy woman that lyues, if
you would amend the wrong which you haue
done her, in not making accoumpte of the
ſignes by which ſhe hath aſſayed to cauſe you
to vnderſtande her griefe. I knowe not a
woman vnder heauen, (ſayeth he) of whom I
haue had ſuch acquayntaunce, to know anye
ſigne that ſhoulde ſhow me her priuie affection:
And would you haue her diſpayre of that
(ſayeth ſhe) which ſhe ſeeth alſo miſtaken, you
not willing to ſee any thing in ſo playne a
thing, and not to perceyue at all wherevnto
thinges are offered ſo openlye to the ſences of
him that is ſo vnſenſible, that hee can not
comprehende the meanes and deuyſes of the
paſſyonate, and which taſteth not the vyands
purpoſed to be diſcouered.
               I vnderſtande not thys talke (ſayeth hee)
if you expreſſe it not otherwyſe.
               Thys is, then ſayeth the Chambermayd that
my Coſyn is ſo amorous of you, that if you
haue not pittye of her, ſhe is in daunger to end
her lyfe myſerablye. Amorous of me, ſayeth
the chaſte yong man, is it poſſyble that

a daughter of her age, ſhould be ſo vnſhamfaſt
and impudēt, as to ſolocite the ſonne, after ſhe
hath bene deflowred by the father. Auaunte
you ſtrumpets, loue ſuch as you be, and go excerciſe
your tromperyes with the Deuils, that
may furbiſſe you according to the heates that
ſo moleſt you, you ſhew well the place of your
byrth, which was neuer otherwyſe then infamous
and beaſtly, for who is ſo fooliſh to think
that an euill tree of it ſelfe can bring forth good
or delicious fruite▪ Thinkeſt thou infamous
creature, and vyle Pallyarde, that I will be ſo
wicked, as ſo vnſhamefaſtly to vyolate the bed
of my Lorde and Father, how vnlawfull and
cōmon ſoeuer ſhe be? No, no, I haue I thank
God the Heauen before myne eyes, towarde
the which when I addreſſe my ſight, I behold
one God, which doeth vyſyte the iniquities of
the wicked, and payeth to euery one according
to his Iuſtice and demerytes, I haue regarde
to the reuerence that I owe to my father, for
elſe long agone I woulde haue ſente thee towardes
thy father, which was y• Butcher, and
the infamous Miniſter of thy chaſtitie, get
thee away then from hence, and talke no more
to mee of this, elſe I aſſure thee, I ſhall cauſe
my Father to know it, to the ende that he ſhall
holde no longer in his companye, an infection
ſo contagyous as thou, which arte lyke to bee

the ouerthrow and ruine of all his houſe: Hauing
ſayde ſo, the good yong man almoſte beſyde
himſelfe, and greatly abaſhed, departeth
out of the Chamber, leauing the two Flatterers
as much aſhamed and abaſhed, as he was
angry for their impudent requeſt. Nowe this
wanton Concubyne loſeth not her ſtomacke,
but day by day ſhee importunately ſueth vnto
him by her Coſyn: But he remayneth fyrme
in his opynyon, and although he had no deſyre
to reporte it to his Father, yet hee threatneth
them ſo well, that they feared he would doe as
he ſayd, and therefore they addreſt ſuch a treaſon,
as you ſhall heare.
               The deteſtable Palyarde beholding herſelfe
ſo often refuſed, beginneth by lyttle and
little, to conuerte the loue that ſhee bare to this
yong Gentleman, into a fury and deadly hate,
and this inraged enemy increaſed, and tooke
ſuch deepe roote in her harte, that ſhe wyth the
Chambermayde her Coſyn, doth deuyſe the
vtter ruine of him, that had ſo foliſhly diſpyſed
her, ſo they conſulte togythers, ſhe ſhould complayne
to the Father, that his ſonne woulde
with force haue vyolated, and taken his pleaſure
vpon her, which being thus concluded betweene
theſe two abhominable Furyes, was
ſhortly executed. For a certayne tyme after, as
ſone as the old man was gone to ſee his lands,
lying thereaboutes, theſe vnhappy women ſeing

him retourne, euen then began to chaunge
their vyſage, not ceaſing to weepe, ſygh, and
lament, wythout anye will to departe out of
the chamber. The infortunate Gentleman
aryued, came into the Chamber of hys Mynion,
whome he founde all be wept, accompanyed
wyth her counſeller, who for her parte
ſhewed well that it was for ſome greate matter
that they were ſo ſorrowfull. He whyche
loued this euill woman more then himſelfe,
wylling to knowe what thys mente, prayeth
her to comforte her ſelfe, and imbraceth her
ſo gentlely, that the falſe Crocodile, as conſtrayned
to doe ſo, began to weepe more bitterlye
then before, declaring a long Fable

this is your eldeſt ſonne, my Lord; that forgetting

the honour whych he oweth to your age,

bytterly, hee hath ſponne a fayre webbe,
for this morning as ſoone as you were in the
fyeldes, the Rybawde, pardon me ſyr if ſo I
call him, came hyther wyth ſuch a fury, that
I feared hee woulde haue put mee to death,
but hee purſued vppon mee a thing more noyſome
then Death, ſo that as hee was in ſtryuing
to force me, and had done it, my forces ſo
fayled to defende my ſelfe, if this gyrle had not
come by chaunce, the preſence of whome cauſed
him to forſake his enterpryſe.
               The olde man hearing ſuch pittifull newes,
remayned ſo troubled and aſtonyed, that for a
good tyme he ſpake neuer a worde, then breaking
his ſylence, he ſayth: And is this poſſible
that he whom I haue more dearely loued then
myne owne lyfe, hath ſo much miſtaken hys
gentleneſſe, that he would diſhonour the loue
of his father. Ah infortunate chylde, and I a
father greatly to be lamented, ſyth I am tormented
by myne owne bloud, of whome I
thought to haue had ſome greater ioy▪ then he
helde his tongue and ſate downe, caſting his
lokes here & there, with ſuch countenance that
a man might iudge the greefe of his mynde to

be more exceſſyue then his ſtrength was able
to ſuffer, yet ſayth he to the Rybawde, I pray
thee my friend, tell me the veritie of this fact,
to the ende I ſhall not doe any thing that may
hereafter cauſe me to late to repente. Ah poore
and caytyfe woman that I am, ſayeth the
ſhameleſſe Pallyard, I ſee well that if this
trompery of your ſonne, had not bene diſcouered
by me, but that by ſome other it had come
to your knowledge, you would haue done ſuch
Iuſtice, that men ſhoulde haue taken example
by me in tyme to come, and nowe ſyth I haue
ſhewed my ſelfe ſo faythfull towardes you,
you doubt of my fayth, and eſteeme my words
for boordes and mockeryes, inquyre you ſyr of
this Gyrle which hath ſeene all the myſterye,
and then doe with me as you ſhal think good,
for I know not well how to liue anye longer
here, where men giue ſuch ſyniſter intertaynmēt
to them which ſerue them faythfully. The
olde man examyneth the chambermayd, who
playde her part better then her Miſtreſſe, and
and incenſeth the Father ſo ſharpely agaynſte
the ſonne, that he purpoſeth to puniſhe him ſo
greeuouſly, as the lyke hath neuer bene hearde
of, rauiſhed then in this extaſye of anger, hee
ſpeaketh a thouſand follies, and was changed
into ſuche a choler, by the impoyſoning of the
dangerouſe venime Ieloſy, as one diſtraught
and frantick, and remayned in the chamber a

great ſpace rulling his eyes in whyteneſſe,
grynding his teeth, and ſaying the dogges paternoſter,
inraged agaynſt him, of whome he
thought he had receyued ſuch an vnworthy
outrage, which during the tyme that this tempeſt
boyled within the ſtomack of his Ieleous
father, lyke as ſome ſay there is a tempeſt vppon
the Tyrenea mountaynes, all the Caniculer
dayes, and alſo in the deepeneſſe of that
Scicilian Ethne: arryued in the houſe in an
vnhappy tyme, for the torment tourned wholy
vpon him, the drops whereof did reuerberate
vpon the infortunate father, who comming into
the place where he was, the vapors cauſe
of the outrage of this vnhappy fortune, do prouoke
him agaynſt his ſonne, who was talking
with an honeſt Lady, that lodged within the
Caſtle. The Ieleous and inraged olde man
fretting with anger, as one preſſed and ouercome
with chollor, no leſſe then a Bull, compelled
through famyne or deſyre of companye,
ſeeing the yong man, entered into ſuch a frenſye,
that wythout ſpeaking what hee woulde
doe, he put his hand to his ſworde, comming
toward his ſonne, he ſayth: Ah infamous traitour,
is it I that muſt ſeeke the meanes to adreſſe
thy rybaudry? By God this ſhall be the
laſt inſtaunt of thy lyfe. The pore infaunt hearing
the furyous menace of his Father, not
knowing whereof the occaſyon of his anger

proceeded, ſayth vnto him: And wherefore ſyr
are you ſo out of your modeſty? or what is y•
that I haue done agaynſt you? ſyth you are ſo
extreame rygorous agaynſt mee, that to my
knowledge, haue neuer offended you. The inſenced
olde man, became more inflamed by
the aunſwere of the chyld, ſaying to him: Ah

me for the purgation of thy wickedneſſe, thou
ſhalt know by & by what I will do, & to what
end the iuſt anger, yt I haue conceiued againſt
thy impudency and temerity doeth tend? ſaying
ſo, he ruſheth vppon the pore infaunt, that
moued not, who ſeing the bloudy ſword of his
father to be drawn out of the ſheath, yt in ſteede
of thruſting him through, doeth prepare him a
more ſodayne death, for hee was vppon a little

had no barre at the entring, to ſtay one by, or
to ſerue for the aſſura
                     •
                  nce of the waye, not remembring
for feare of the blow, the perrillous
place where hee ſtoode, he fell immediatelye
from highe to the grounde, and hys euyll
fortune was ſo great, that the fyrſt part which
touched the earth, doth beare ſufficiēt witneſſe
being broken in peeces, & ſheding his bloud vpon
the ground, his head being ſtroke againſt a
ſtone ſharp in the ende, & faſtened in the earth,
ſo with hys ſtrēgth at the ſame inſtant, he forgoeth
both his ſoule and hys warme bloud,

which runneth out both at his noſe & mouth,
the not only cruell father, but enemy of all humanitie,
not contente to ſee his ſonne humble
himſelfe, & to debaſe him before his face, thinking
that the chyld had fallen by his own will
into the dytch, ſayth: Thou haſt well lopen, for
I ſweare before God, that thou ſhalte dye in
the payne, out of which thou ſhalte not eſcape
my handes this day. Alas what pitty is it of a
man, after he hath wandered out of the limits
of reaſon? Saule once enuyous agaynſt Dauid,
ful of the ſpirite of intelligence, had no reaſon
in performing the purſute of one more iuſt
then hymſelfe. And by prophane wrytinges,
who did mooue Euriſtius to tormente that
ſubduer of Monſters Hercules? but only wilful
mallice & inueterate enuy: truely where the
ſin is not very euidēt, right would that mercy
ſhould be preferred before Iuſtice, & it is more
prayſe for any Maieſtrate, who following the
diuine clemency, to pardon thinges not very euident,
& not ſo cruelly to excerciſe the ſword of
vengeance & rygorous puniſhment, for it cānot
be otherwyſe, then yt he which excerciſeth himſelfe
in cruelty, ſhal feele ſuch a torment in hys
mynd, that in the end wil cauſe him to diſpaire
of his helth, or elſe to ſuch a ſharpe repentance,
that the very prick of that opynyon, wyll not
ceaſe for the moſte parte, wythout accompanying
a man to hys buryall, ſo it chaunced

in this tyrannyous old man, who hauing deſcended
the ſteppes, to ſee the recouery of hym
that was altogyther vnſencyble, he behelde a
ſpectakle before him, that cauſed him to forget
his affection, that he bare to the vnfortunate,
who had adreſt his body thyther, he ſeing
then the miſchaunce of his ſonne, lying in ſuch
poore order, his head burſt in peeces, his body
diſpearced, and yet ſtyrring, was moued wyth
ſuch dolour, that he began to forget his Ieloſy
and to feele ſuche a remorſe in his intrayles,
that cauſed him to deteſt his fortune, for that
he had bene ſo blynded in his concupiſence.
Alas, ſayeth he, vnhappye Father, dareſt thou
ſhew thy ſelfe among any good men, that haſt
put to death ſuch and ſo honeſt a chylde, for the
appetyte of ſo impudent a Pallyarde: Ah my
ſonne pardon me this offence, for I aſſure thee
that I will make ſuch a ſolemne amends, that
thou ſhalte haue whereof to content thee, and
they whiche ſuruiue an occaſion to vituperate
my fury, and ſyth this my hart (ſayeth he, ſtryking
his breſt) moſt vnhappily hath receyued
the pernicious venyme of falſe perſwaſyon,
whereof thou haſt felte the bitterneſſe, it ſhall
abyde the penitence, and thou my body, ſhalte
ſerue for the gyfte and laſt ſacrifyce proceding
from me, for the apeaſing of the ſhadow of my
ſonne, towardes whome I will ſende my ſpirites,
to requyre him of pardon, in the obſcure

fieldes of death, and to whome I will ſacryfyce
my wicked, infamous, and vnhappy lyfe,
which my ſonne being dead, ſhal be more weary
vnto me, then that darke voyage, or any other
thing that may diſquiet mee at al, hauing
ſayd ſo, weeping ſorrowfully, he imbraceth the
body of his ſonne, and beholding his ſword, he
ſayeth. But go to then, ſyth his ſoule is departed,
and his deſteny hath taken him awaye,
murder him that hath executed murder, in the
perſon of him, whome he ought to loue moſte.
Theſe wordes ended, mooued wyth a dyuiliſh
diſpayre, ſtamping lyke a Lyon, and pricked
forwarde I knowe not of what Furye, as a
wylde Bore whetting his Tuſkes, after he is
hurte by ſome miſchaunce, tourning the miſchiefe
vpon himſelfe, in falling on the poynt of
the ſworde, which paſſeth through the center
of the hart, he tombleth vpon the corpes of his
ſonne, yet warme and ſtyrring, and ſo ſheding
the commō bloud of them two, he rendereth vp
his ſoule to him, to whome hee had ſo long vowed
it, by his wicked and impure lyfe. What
harte is there that hauing red this, or in making
rehearſal, but would bewayle the chance
and miſfortune of this deſperate old mā, who
truely had bene excuſable in his fury, if the deuill
had not taken away his ſences, and forced
him by the inormitye of hys vyce, and by the
greatneſſe of his ſynnes, to deſtroye his owne

ſoule. Theſe be examples that bee ſet forth for
our inſtruction, to the end that the perrill of an
other ſhould induce vs to beſeech God that hee
woulde delyuer vs from the ſpirite of obſtinacy,
and awake vs out of that dreame, whiche
doth blynd our ſences, in following the flattering
deſyres of our concupiſence, for otherwiſe
it were great pitty to behold the faults which
we commit euery houre. This vnhappye man
blynded in his ſin, forſaking God, neyther acknowledged
his Iuſtice, nor his mercy, experimēteth
alſo the fruits of his infidelity, wickedneſſe,
& obſtynacy, leauing behynd him, the memory
of his deeds, as wel for the aduertiſemēt
of al men, as for the imitation, & deterring, not
only of the aged, but of all ages, to auoyde the
plagues and diuiliſhneſſe of whoredom, which
do bewytch and take away the ſences of men,
the end whereof is death, and puniſhment in
the infernall lake. The newes hereof were diſperced
incontynent throughout al the houſe, ſo
that the rybawd which had adreſt this deuiſe,
hauing heard and ſeene the whole, mooued
by her owne offence, & the witneſſe which her
mynd did beare of her ſinne, fearing ſhe ſhould
haue Iuſtyce, if ſhe dyd not immytate the illuſtryous
fact of her deteſtable louer, ſo that all
afrayd, ſhe runneth to a pit, into which ſhe leapeth
headlong, and wherin ſhee was myſerably
drowned, a death truly, althogh it was furious,

yet to good for the puniſhment of the deteſtable
mallice of a woman, ſo wicked as ſhee
was, which merited to haue all the paynes togythers,
that euer were inuented by men, for
the ſcourge of euil liuers. Thē there was word
ſent to Milain to y• Maieſtrate, to inform him,
who hauing in examinatiō the chamber maid,
that was the ayder of the deſperate Palyard,
made her to confeſſe all the facte, wherefore
ſhe was hāged, and her body giuen to be meat
to the foules of the ayre, and no leſſe was done
to ye carcaſes of the two louers, which agaynſt
all right both deuyne and humayne, had vyolently
come to their ende, and as for the yong
man, he was buryed wyth ſuch pompe, as hys
vertue did well deſerue, & was bewayled of al
eſtates, for the modeſty that did apeare in him,
by which he hath ſemed to immitate the Scipions
and Fabions, who once liuing with ſuch
temperance, haue cauſed their glorious names
to remayne euen to this daye. So always the
death of the well lyuer is fortunate, for beſides
that he paſſeth to the lyfe, whych hath no end,
and goeth to inioy the holy and Godly companye
of the bleſſed ſoules, hee doeth glorify his
memory, by the knowledge that the poſteritye
haue of his vertue, which is ſo grauen and imprynted
in the harts of their children, that neyther
Death nor tyme hath power to deface
it. Vppon the Tombe of this yong example

of chaſtity, ſome good Poet of that tyme made
this Epitaph, which inſueth, to ſhow that ſuch
as he was, ought to be prayſed with ſuch Eglogs,
and not any of them which haue defyled

                  To Heauen and earth are now by death aſſured.
                  Thus hath he chaunged his lyfe, and is not dead,
                  But liueth with God reioycing in his glory:
                  That cauſed him the hauty Skyes t'aſſend,
                  And happy to haue before him, of vertue the memory.
                  Thus being dead, he lyueth without ſorrow or greefe,
                  Therefore thou that paſſeſt by, thy teares refrayne:
                  If enuye doe not cauſe thee to bewayle the ioy,

1494. After that Chriſtopher
Colombe, wyth the Nauye of the
catholick King, Ferdinand, ſonne
of Iohn Aragon, did dicouer the
Weſt Ilandes, not before diſcouered, that can
bee founde remembered by the wryting of any
Hyſtory, eyther auncyent, or new, Lewys
Bartheny Bolognois, as he himſelf recoumpteth
in the ij. Boke of his Nauigations, in coaſting
by this countrey, for that he would haue
knowledge of the naturall things, the maner
of the liuing of thoſe ſtraunge nations, and alſo
to get ſome profyte in paſſing by Ethiope, he
areſted in an Ile, the Capytall town whereof
is called, Orme, not diſtaunte from the forme
Lande, aboue twelue myles, where he behelde
this pittifull Hyſtory enſuing, of an execrable
ſonne, and of his crueltye agaynſt his aged father,
and vpon his bretheren, yet in their infancy
in this citty. Then a little before the ſayd
Bartheny came thyther, the Soulden there,

was a Lord of the ſecte of Mahomet, a man
very vertuous and gentle for a More and Infydell,
almoſt an hundered yeares olde, he beſydes
that he was rych in Golde and pearles,
ſyth in that quarter there were found the moſt
exquyſyth and fayre Pearles that one ſhoulde
ſee, eſteemeth his age happye, to ſee himſelfe
the Father of a leuen ſonnes, all lawfullye begotten,
the yongeſt wherof, had better fortune
by murther, then good chaunce, as you maye
ſee by this which followeth, for the eldeſt contrary
to the reſt, was craftye, ſubtle, and malicyous,
& the moſt deſſembling Palyard that
was in all the countrey, who ſtudyed wyth
himſelfe dyuers tymes how to become imperious
ouer his bretheren, after the deceaſe of his
father. But the Souldan had two bondmen
that were of that Land, of that rich & famous
Monarch of the Indyans, that mē cal Preſter
Iean, theſe two Indian ſlaues were ſo well
affectioned to the doings of their Lorde, that
he had made them as rich, as any of his Vaſſals,
and they had ſo well got the good will of
the people by their natyue bounty, & excellente
vertue, that euery one doth adorate and prayſe
them as much, or more as the Prince himſelf,
thus they going about to do good to all men, &
to diſpleſe none, made no report to y• Prince, of
that which afterwards was cauſe of the ruine
of ſome of his ſubiectes, theſe two by their prudence

did keepe ſylent the doinges of their ambicious
yong Lorde, not for that the Galland
did thereby loſe the deſyre, to doe that afterwardes,
which one would not thinke nor beleeue,
towarde his father, notwithſtanding
the good intreatmente that the olde man ſhewed
him, for the nature of y• wicked is ſo peruerſe,
that the more a man aſſayeth to obtayn
his good will, the more he addreſſeth his miſchiefe,
and whetteth his teeth in murder, and
enuyous for the exployte of his wickedneſſe,
becauſe his harte is ſo venimous, and full of
poyſon, that he cannot indure from executing
the thing that is contrarye to vertue, by the
daungerous infection of his vyces, as verye
well appeareth in this ambicious and cruell
tyraunt, which could not indure or attende, till
Nature had fyniſhed that, wherof ſhe had begone
to approch, and alreadye to attayne the
ende, he purpoſeth not onely tyrannyouſlye to
vſurpe the domynyons of his father, but to execute
the moſt deteſtable acte vpon him, that a
man can eyther thinke or ymagyne, that is, to
murder them of whome he had his lyfe, and to
fyll his handes with the innocent bloud of his
Bretheren, and for the beginning of this Tragedy,
hee cauſeth to be impryſoned vnder the
tytle of good fayth, his Father, his Mother,
and his bretheren, except the yongeſt, by the

himſelfe into a Dyuell, the Father of all
wyckedneſſe, and hath taken vppon him the
manners of the enimy of all humanitye? Alas
wylte thou ſuffer the bloude of my Parentes
and Bretheren to be ſhed innocently and that
the ſonne ſhall remayne without vengeaunce▪
Hath not the flame and the ſmoke ſtopt and
taken away the voyce of them that requyred
thee of Iuſtice, for the greeuouſneſſe of their
torments? Behold, O mighty God, and viſyte
the ſynfull lyfe of this Tyraunt, who diſpyſing
thee, hath depryued them of lyfe, by whome
thou gaueſt him his owne in this world; and
ſurely the iuſt color of the yong Prince, againſt
the furyes of his Brother, had no leſſe taken
awaye his ſences, then was once the chylde
wanting his ſpeech, or the ſonne of the Lidian
Creſſus, beholding his father in daunger of
death, during the ſacke of the Towne, by the
great army, and ſouldyars of the Monarch of

the Meades. But the meſure of the iniquities
of this Paracyde, was not yet come to the fulneſſe
and ende, which during theſe things,
made the people to vnderſtande the death of
the murthered, pronouncing moreouer, that if
they wente aboute to refuſe to obay him, hee
knew well how to proceede to compell them.
The people ſeeing him wel accompanyed, and
that he was wholy ſeaſed of all the fortreſſes,
craftely and wittingly, ſubmitted themſelues
willingly to his obedience. O Beaſt of manye
heads, thou ſheweſt well that in the foule fantaſy
of ſuch a multitude, reaſon, equity, or prudence,
can haue no place, and ſurely the contynuall
waues that cauſe the Seas to ebbe and

as the counſel and opinion of a multitude hath

of one day, and the reſt of one nighte,
to ouerthrow all that hath bene afore concluded,
and all the choyſe of opynyons wil be caſt
to the ground, by the blaſt of a ſimple ſedition,
and folly of the people, the counſell of whome
are more gouerned by temeritie, & ſodayn motion,
then by reaſon and ſage forſight of that
which may come after, neyther the conſtrayned
obedience of this multitude, nor the force
of his Souldyors, that were wholy weary of
his prowde and cruell Tyranny, nor yet the
inexpugnable ſtrength of his fortreſſes could

impeche that which the diuine prouidence had
ordayned for the puniſhmente of the factes of
this wicked creature, who loued better to
raygne one Month alone, then a long time after
the deceaſe of his father reuerenced of the
people, beloued and ſerued of his bretheren,
and not puniſhable by the iuſtyce of men, beholding
nor feeling his mynde guiltye before
GOD, by the conſcience of his owne miſdeeds.
Mark how he himſelfe made the Net
wherein he was intangled, and whetteth the
knyfe whereon he myſerably ended his lyfe.
You haue hearde how the two Indian 
                     •
                  laues
were retourned into their owne houſes, after
that the fury of this Afrycan Nero, had ſhed
forth his poyſon, and that his brother lyued
with the Prieſts of their law, bewayling continually
both his Parents and his miſfortune
to ſee himſelfe ſo weake and vnfauoured, that
he could not reuenge the death of them, that
being dead, cauſed his ſorrowfull lyfe, and the
abſence of whome, made him ſo vnprofytable
in all thinges, and ſo vnhappy in all his deuyſes.
               The Tyraunt then as it might be, or as it is
more true, wearye of hys lyfe, coulde no
longer auoyde that whiche the heauens had
ordayned for the iuſte puniſhmente of hys
vniuſtyce, and demerytes, delyberatyng
now wyth hymſelfe, to take away the light

from the eyes of the two aged Indian ſlaues,
which he could not commodyouſly do, as well
for the reuerence that the Souldyers bare to
this lincked couple, as for that he knewe they
were wel beloued, and cheriſhed of the people,
wherfore he purpoſeth a new treaſon, to bring
his deſyre to paſſe, wythout any ſlaunder, and
without incurring the euill will of the people,
and of his great armye, that is, in practiſyng
the one to be the murtherer of his companyon,
and afterwardes to puniſh y• murtherer according
to the law, & his deſerts, therfore he cauſeth

ſhall receyue of thy ſeruyce and indeuour, thou

thou canſt or wouldeſt deſyre. My Lord, ſayth
the ſlaue, not for any hope of ryches, being ſo
terreſtyall a thing, ſo vayne, and of ſo ſmall
duraunce, I will go aboute to attempte anye
thing, neyther to ſee my ſelf exalted to honours
and dignityes, (ſyth this is the Chayre wherein

ſhall beholde me ready prepared to execute all

owe you, as to my Lorde and Prince, whyche
I truſt will not commaunde anye thing, that
without ſtayning myne honour, and blemyſhing

the ſlaue thought that the Tyraunte woulde
haue geuen him in charge, to haue fetched the

cauſe him fe

man woulde not haue done for feare of death,
nor to haue bene Emperour of all Africa, as he
afterwardes ſheweth by effecte. Be as it may
be (ſayth the cruel Souldā) it is that I would
haue thee put to death Caime, for ſo was the other

Slaue called, ſyth he hath done me ſuch a
diſpleaſure, that if I ſee not his death, my ſpirite
cannot liue in reſt, or contentment.
               Ah my Lorde, ſayeth Mahometh, commaunde
me any other thing if it pleaſe you, for
my harte will not ſuffer mee to ſee his death,
much leſſe to kil him, whome I loue as myne
owne lyfe, and wyth whome I haue bene
brought vp euen from my byrth, if hee hath
done any fault agaynſt you Lordſhip, let hym
be accuſed publiquelye, according to the cuſtome
of the countrey, to the ende hee may receyue
puniſhment, according to hys deſertes.
The Souldan (diſſembling his deſpyte and
cholor) aunſwereth him very courteouſly: I
am glad that I haue ſuch a ſeruaunte in my
power as thou art, & I thank thee for thy good
aduertiſement thou haſt giuen me, concerning
my duty to iuſtice: Moreouer, think yt all this
that I haue ſayd vnto thee, is to no other ende
but to aſſaye thy conſtancye, and make a profe
of thy fydelitye, thou mayeſt therefore departe
when thou ſhalte thinke it good, and hereafter
I will unploye thee in ſome better thing, and
of greater importaunce. The ſlaue whiche
knewe the venyme of the Serpente, and
how deadly it was, fayled not after hee was

                  yred, to garde hymſelf from the buſhments

ſelfe that he would aſſaye that agaynſte him,

wherin he had fayled agaynſt his companion,
and in that his opynyon deceyued him not, for
as ſone as he was departed from the preſence
of the Souldan, the Tyraunt inraged and invenimed,
ſent to ſeke Cayme y• other ſlaue, vnto
whom he vſeth like wordes, as to the firſt, &
perſwadeth him ſo wel, yt the wycked Moore
ſweareth vnto him to kyll his companyon, in
what ſort he could. Behold whervnto the execrable
mallice of men doth extēd, that through
the appetyte of a pernicious Tyraunt, the one
friend hath coniured agaynſt the lyfe of him,
that a little before, had refuſed to make hym

(what frawde ſo euer he doth excogitate) falleth
into the pit, that he hath prepared agaynſt

the porte of the harte, manifeſting the will and

him to pardon this faulte, that he had attempted,
more for feare that the tyrant would

pleaſeth God that no treaſon ſhould enter into

finiſh the courſe of his age without reuenging

that without his deſertes, hath bene purpoſed

Souldan, and tell him that thou haſt executed
that which he commaunded thee, and for the
reſt let me alone, for I will prouyde ſuch a remedy,
that in tyme to come, the lyfe of the vertuous

               Cayme hauing eſcaped from ſuch a daunger,
promyſeth hym to doe all, that it ſhould
pleaſe him to giue charge, to execute, whyche

had tolde the Tyraunt how he had bathed his

The Tyraunte full of eaſe, and contentmente
began to ſhowe hymſelfe verye familyer,

the honours vnte which their election had called
him, louing better to lyue a pryuate lyfe,

then to enioye a whole countrey, wythout hauing
iuſt tytle of poſſeſſyon, doe eaſily accorde
to the counſell and ſage opynyon of Mahometh:
So the yong Prince was fetched from
the Temple, and placed in the ſeate of his father,
wyth thys condicyon, that hee ſhould
haue alwayes the olde man for aſſyſtaunte
and counceller, and by whoſe handes ſhoulde
paſſe all the affayres of importaunce, that
might chaunce wythin the Ile.
               Beholde a notable and rare example of two
great extremities in the vertue of one man,
the aſſuraunce and Magnaminitye to reuenge
a publique iniurye, vpon one that of him
ſelfe was publique, if by his vyce he had not
made himſelfe more abiect, then the leaſte of
the common and popular multytude, and
the modeſtye conioyned wyth great reaſon
and foreſyghte, to deſpyſe that, wherefore
almoſte all men at theſe dayes doe take
and adreſſe, for what occaſyon ſoeuer it bee,

of Religyon, peruerting the order of
iudgementes, reduſyng and rendryng all

full force, and as was latelye ſeene in the
tyrannous rule of the Myllinois of our tyme,
and once in the raygn of the Perſians and
Greekes, the Monarchie of whome,

               ¶The Marques of Ferraria, without
hauing regarde to fatherly loue,
cauſed his owne Sonne to be beheaded, for that he
was found in Adultery with his faire Mother in law,
who lykewyſe loſt her head in Pryſon, by his commaundement.
               
                  
                     IN the lyfe of Phillip Vicont
Duke of Millayne, ſonne of
Iohn Galeas, he y• ſo often made
warres againſt the Florentynes,
and their Lyne, then raigning in Fraunce,
Charles the ſeuenth, that good King, which
chaſed the Engliſhe men out of Normandye,
the moſte excellente and myghtye Prince, Nicholas
of Eaſt, the thirde Marques of Ferraria
(he that for his ſinguler wyſdome had bene
ſente ſo often as Arbitrator, to determyne the
controuerſyes, that chaunced amongeſt the
Princes of Italy) made warre agaynſte hys

                  ynes, and
Bolongnoys (although he were a baſtard) did
cheſe the ſayd Azzo, lawful and iuſt ſucceſſour
of the Marquiſdō, out of Italy, & conſtrayned
him to ende his dayes in exyle, in the Ile of
Candy, aunciently called Create, & he becauſe
Ferraria was obedyent vnto him, as vnto an

vniuſt vſurper, doth gouern them ſo politickly
and trayn the people ſo gently, that neuer any
of his prediceſſors liued more quyetly, he being
confyrmed in his eſtate, eſpouſeth in his fyrſte
maryage, the daughter of the Lorde Frauncis
of Cararya (after y• Lord of Padue) by whom
he had one ſonne, which at his chriſtning, was
called Hugnes, the bewty & phiſ
                     •
                  omy of whom
did promiſe ſome future dexterity & excellency
in him, this is he of whom I intend moſt to intreate,
as chiefe cauſe of the diſcription of this
hiſtory, he was ſurnamed by the pleaſure and
wil of the Father, the County of Rouigo, and
kept with ſuch care, dilligence, & ſtudy of them
that had the charge ouer him, as did appertain
to the Chyld of ſuch a Lord as be, which commanded
ouer Ferraria. Certayne dayes after
the birth of this yong Prince, the Marchioues
his mother departed this lyfe, to y• great greefe
of her huſband, which loued her no leſſe, thē his
own ſelf▪ & to the diſpleaſure of all his ſubiects
that wholy had tryed ſuch curteſy, gentlneſſe, &
liberallity to be in her, as whoſe lyke memorye
hath not left ingrauen in the harts of y• poſterity,
this yong Prince as he growes in yeres, giueth
ſuch teſtimony of his future vertue, & wiſdome,
that a man ſhould fynd a few Lordes of
ſuch a raxe in all Italy, that did excell him (ſo
much are they in fault that ſuffer thēſelues to
be ouercome) if that fortune had not giuen him

ſuch a foile, as the proceſſe of his yeres did forbid
it in him, whych had giuen ſuch a beginning
to his honor. But what if the affectyons
of men doe ebbe and flow, and neuer continue
in one ſtate, as the vnquyet mouing of the ſea,
it is no otherwyſe of the iudgementes and ordinaunces
of God, whereof there is not one
left vndone, without coming to the end, ordained
by the preſence of him, for the ende of the
county could not be euil, as euery one thought,
by the coniecture of the vertue of his yong
yeares, but beholde the ende.
               This Marques Nicholas being very yong &
luſty, after the death of his wyfe, deliberating
with himſelfe not to marry agayn beginning
ſo well, as he that had the euill will of none of
his neighbours▪ to take his eaſe, and to paſſe
his tyme in ſuch delightes, that euery nighte
he chaungeth his paſture, and continuing his
wantoneſſe, doth his indeuour ſo wel, that the
troupe of his Baſtardes were not inferiour in
number to them▪ that were begottē by the old
Priam of Troy, a litle before y• Greeks did beſeege
it, and to the end that the hyſtory ſhal not

was that famous and renowned Lord Borze,
the ſonne of a Damſell Senoyis, of the houſe
of Tolomey. This Borze for his vertue, and for
that he had done ſome ſeruice to the Romayne
church, was created and erected in the Dukedome
of Ferraria, by Paule the ſecond of that

France Lewis the leuenth, and Frederick of
Auſtryge, holding the imperiall Crowne, by
whome afterwardes the ſayde Borze, was
proclaymed and made Duke of Rege, and
Modena.
               But retourning to our purpoſe, the Marques
hauing now long tyme lyued wythoute
a lawfull wyfe, was deſyred, as it myghte be,
of ſome of his ſubiectes, to perſwade himſelfe
to 
                     •
                  emarrye, who practiſeth ſo well, that he taketh
to Wyfe, the Daughter of the Lorde
Charles Maleteſt, which becauſe hee was

ouer many Cittyes and Villages of the Marches,

one of the moſte braue and ſage Captaynes amongeſt

wyfe, more to ſatiſfye his friendes, or to couer

his wanton and effemynate will, then for to
chaſten himſelf, and to increaſe and multiplye
his raſe, which was the cauſe that God for his
puniſhment ſent ſuch a ſlander into his houſe,
worthy ſurely to be noted, as well as it is
ſtrange & poſſible, if the memory thereof were
not freſh, it woulde ſeeme after incredible, for
the pacience of God is ſuch, that he attendeth
the conuerſyon of the ſynner, but ſeeing hym
indurate in his wickedneſſe, doth puniſhe hym
ſo ſharpely, that the generations enſuing, doe
beholde the ſharpeneſſe of the puniſhmente,
and marke wherefore that good Chriſt, ſecond
to none in pacience, doth ſo dilligently ſet forth
examples, to ſhewe that there ſhalbe no ſinne
lefte vnpuniſhed in the preſence of the Lorde,
for what greater ruine can come to the houſe
of any Prince, then the diſhonour of him, or
his? What greater ſorrow, thē to ſee the ſhedding
of his owne bloud? and it is alwayes the
Iuſtyce of GOD, to practiſe that vpon them,
whych contynue their diſobedience, accumylate
euill vpon euill, and prouoke the Lorde by
their wyckedneſſe, as did this Marques, the
wyfe of whome, ſeeing herſelfe ſo deſpyſed, as
ſhee that preſumed ouermuche of her bewtye,
could not ſo greatly command her conſtancy,
nor ſo well moderate her affections, but that
ſhe did complayne her to a Damſell, whome
ſhe had brought with her forth of her country,

and whome ſhee truſted very well, who being
one day in the chamber of her miſtreſſe, ſeeing
that in ſecrete ſhe was ſad beyond meaſure, &
that dayly ſhee waxeth worſe & worſe, was ſo
bold to ſay theſe, or lyke wordes vnto her. Madame,
I beſeech you think it not ſtrange, if the
deſyre that I haue to do you ſeruice, doe make
me ſo bold to demand of you the cauſe of ſo ſodayn
change yt I perceyue in you, whiche had
wont to be the only ſolace, of the anguiſhes &
ſorrowes of my Lord your father, by your pleſantnes,
if perchance there happened vnto him
any greefe, & now you do nothing but ſorrow,
ſigh, & complayn: I beſeech you Madame, if euer
I haue done any thing in your ſeruice, that
meriteth recompence, to do me this pleaſure, &
honor, to tel me y• occaſion of your diſquietnes,
to the end yt if this power that is in me, may do
any thing for your contētment, I wil imploy it
with the life yt I haue vowed ſo long time, to
be obedient to your commandments. Alas my
friend, ſayth the Marchiones, I am aſhamed,
being ſuch a one as I am, ſo to tormēt my ſelf,
beholding me ſo contēned of my Lord y• Marques:
I aſſure thee, that if the hope of ſome allegeance
did not comfort me, thou ſhouldſt behold
what ſacryfyce. I would make of my life
to the crueltys of him, that hath made more accoumpt
of one of theſe common & deſpiſed women,
then of me that am his wyfe, & not inferiour
in bewty to any of them. What Madame?

anſwereth y• Damſell, haue you no other cauſe
to diſquiet your ſelf, then the fooliſh loue of my
Lord the Marques, truly this is a very ſmall
occaſyon, & a cauſe more then fryuolous to vex
your ſelfe, lay away al this from you, & aſſay to
liue ioyfully with them that loue & eſteme you,
attending til time ſhal cole his ardēt deſyres, &
cauſe him change his affectiō, take good heede
that he haue no cauſe of miſcōtentment, for to
quite him of his paſſions, apprehenſions, & vnſemely
companyes, in the meane time, ioy you
only of y• which is yours, not vſing ſuch foly as
to ſtain your honor, by vnlawful acquaintance
with any other then of him, which is giuen you
for Lord & Eſpouſe, with ſhortning of your life
for ſuche a fooliſhe miſtruſt, proceeding of that
euill▪ Ieloſy. O God (ſayth the Marchyones,
all bedewed wyth teares) howe true is that,
which euery one ſpeaketh in a common Prouerbe:
the whole cā eaſily giue councel to them
that be ſick: Ah my friend, if you felt the diſquietues
that wil not ſuffer me to take any reſt in
my mynd, & the cauſe of the bitterneſſe y• doeth
bereue me of my ſences, I am aſſured that hauing
pittye of me, thou wouldeſt councell mee
of an other ſorte, or elſe helpe to execute that,
which ſhoulde ſerue for the intyre ſolace and
contentmente of my ſpirite: the Marques
hath led this lyfe a long tyme, and it is vnpoſſible
that hee ſhoulde chaunge, but by death,
or extreme age, and in the meane tyme I paſſe

my tyme in vayn, accompanyed without comforts,
that procures me to ouerpaſſe the night
with teares in ſteede of reſt, and the daye agaynſt
my will, I am merry to contente hym,
that ſhewes me no pleaſure, no not that which
he oughte by the ſacred rightes of thoſe bands
which haue cōioyned vs togyther, would God
death had takē away my lyfe in the Cradle, to
the end that not remayning vnto this preſent,
I ſhould not haue felt of what force is the deſpighte
of an honeſt Ladye, being deceyued by
her huſbande: Alas, howe happye are they of
baſe condicion, that may wythout great conſciēce
inaculate their blood, that doth redound
but to the ſhame of a fewe: Ah honor and Nobillitie,
howe tyrannouſly doe you brydle the
Ladyes, that how much the preferment is before
men, the eſtate of all ſhould not be alyke, to
the end, that the people ſhould not ſhadow our
brightneſſe, more then the re
                     •
                  own of the common
ſorte of men and women, which dye with
the memory of their deedes, that are buryed in
the ſame tombe wyth their bodyes, or if the
Lawes did as well puniſhe the diſloyaltye of
the huſband as the ſymple women, that by a
naturall vyce, are ſometymes forced to forget
themſelues, euen till they bee ouercome by the
appetytes of the fleſh, how ioyfully woulde I
reuenge my ſelfe of the iniury which that periured
and vnlouing huſband hath done to me?

becauſe that euery couple ſhould equallye receyue
the payne and puniſhmente according to
their demerites. But after the Lawes were
made, they were Tyrauntes ouer vs, the inquyetors
of our reſt, and the common Ennymyes
of o
                     ••
                   perfectiō, who did authoryſe them
without the 
                     •
                  yde, helpe, or conſente, of any of
vs: After that ſhe exclaymeth, as one halfe inraged,
ſaying wyth a voyce that declared the
vehemencye of her torment, and the mutacyon
of her mynd. But ſyth I muſt dye a thouſand
tymes, if ſo be I let this pa

                  ſe without puniſhmente,
I would he wel knew it, that I intend
not to lyue wyth ſuch griefe and ſorrow, as he
hath geuen me cauſe a good tyme, and then let
chaunce what may, for this is a torment great
ynough, as I beleeue, to abyde ſuch a Tyranny,
and to feele the puiſſaunte prickes of loue,
the better whereof is no leſſe to bee wyſhed,
then death, hauing ſayde ſo, the Marchiones
holdeth her tongue, attending the aunſwere
of the Damſell, who hauing a long tyme bethought
her ſelfe, aunſwereth in this ſorte:
Madame, as yet I neuer had experyence of
what might the force of loue is, and by that
meanes I haue neuer felt what is the diſdayn
and ſorrow of them, that perceyue themſelues
deceyued of him, of whome ſhe oughte to bee
the intyre and onely beloued, yet I beleeue neuertheleſſe,
that the paſſion both of the one and

the other is ſo great and vnmeaſurable, that
the ſurpluſage of the alterations that trouble &
greeue the ſpirite, are nothing in reſpect of this
inexplicable diſtreſſe. The argument of this,
I take of you Madame, the Conſtaucye of
whome is ſo troubled, by the outrage and fury
of Ieloſy, that heretofore hath 
                     ••
                  uer giuen
ſuſpition of chaunge, or miſcontentmente of
harte: But O God, I beholde and perceaue
the imbecillity of humayn mynds, & how well
they are diſquyeted of dyuers & vnlawfull deſyres,
which take reſt no more in the ſtomack &
thoughts▪ then the ſea Sandes, inſtate with a
whyrle wynde, in an extreame hote daye. Ah
Madame, where is the great Chaſtity y• made
you once renowned before al the Ladies of Italy?
I beſeech you aſſay to contayn your ſelfe
in that honeſt reputation wherin hythe
                     •
                  to you
haue lyued, to the great contente of your Parents
& friends. What? if reaſon haue ſo little
force in you, that you deliberate to followe the
vyce of wantoneſſe, and to ſearch another for
the accompliſhment of your deſyres, then the
Marques your huſband, by all meanes do the
thing ſo ſecretly, that the houſe wherof you are
come, receyue no diſhonour, and your ſelfe merite
infamy & greuous puniſhment. The Marchiones
anſwereth nothing to the ſage admonition
of the wyſe Damſel, beginning to think
with herſelfe, not by what meanes ſhe mighte

wythdraw her huſband from the diſordered &
wanton lyfe that he led, but rather howe ſhee
might reuenge her ſelfe, and with whome ſhee
might giue him y• counter change, in puniſhing
him by the ſame faulte. But reaſon doeth not
extend herſelfe to this end, that ſinne and vertue
ſhould be placed alyke, for vertue is the ſuperlatiue
aboue her, contrary, which is put vnder
her as a ſubiect, for the inſtruction of anye
that knowes not what is vyce, let him take
heede it fall not out other wyſe, that if any bee
forgetfull of his honeſty and voyd of good maners,
we by his example, launche not forth
and let ſlip the brydles of our harts after vice,
as after ſome rare and precious thing, and
alwayes thys is ſo well practyſed at thys day,
that men eſteeme Vyce but by the ſyghte of
them that doe it by example. Doeth or maye
thys come before the place of Equitye and
righte? and meryte no reprehenſyon, of this
you may well aſſure your ſelfe, by the foule
deliberation of this wilfull Pryuces, whyche
doeth ſuffer her ſelfe to bee ſo blynded by her
noughtye and vuruelye appetytes, that doe
peruerte the common order and righte of nature,
which the laws hath conſtitute amongſt
men for the reu
                     •
                  rence of blood, perſons, and
ciuill honeſty: becommeth extreame amorous
of him, whoſe wanton toyes, oughte more to
feare her, then the memorye of Death himſelfe.
I haue declared beefore that the

Marques had one onely Sonne by his fyrſt
wyfe, a goodly Gentleman in perfection, and
which during theſe furies of his faire mother,
was attayned to the age of eyghtene or twenty
yeares, it was he of whom the ſecond Phedrya
became amorous, but this was not hee
that deſerues to be put in the vertuous Role of
Hypolytus, the ſonne of the Amaſō, in reſiſting
the amorous folly and inceſt of the Marchyones,
happy was that Greeke heyre, for he dyed
by the iniuſt diſpleaſure of his father, whyche
was no ſhame to him at all, hauing leſt, in that
whiche the other did, that hath giuen ſure teſtymony
of his loue to vertue and modeſty, but
the other hath made his vyce and naughty wil
knowne to his owne Father, as you maye eaſily
perceyue in the readyng of thys Hyſtorye,
nowe this yong Prynce ſeeing himſelfe intertayned
very familyarly by his mother in law,
that tooke no pleaſure, but in the contemplation
of the bewty and good grace of the county,
did neuer thinke that ſuche diſloyaltye coulde
lodge in the harte of his fathers wyfe, & therefore
he deuiſeth to requyte it her, but with ſuch
reuerence as the Chylde oweth to the mother,
whych ſhe taketh not for any denyall, hauyng
a deſyre of a more ſtrayghte familliaritie with
him, whych the more ſhe deſyreth, the more ſhe
is inflamed in her former flames of loue, and
doing her dilligence ſo well, by her owne ſelfe,

becauſe that the yong man, for that he as yet
had not practyſed loue, knewe not howe to
take heede to her countenances, ſygnes, wanton
lookes, ſyghes, and vuperfyte words, that
to one more ſub

                  il, might eaſily haue diſcouered
her paſſyon, ſhee forgetting and deſpyſing
both her honour and lyfe, (if the Countye had
made the reporte thereof to his father) doeth
deliberate to diſcouer vnto him her affections,
for, (ſaying to her ſelfe) howe ſhall I cure my
aleadged euill, if I keepe it ſecrete from him,
of whome I intende my ſafetye, is this the
way: to deuyſe the occaſyon of famillyer curteſyes,
that I doe vnto hym, truely his tender
youth doth denye him to ſee ſo well, and to
know the moſt difficult humour, which were
ynough for a man that perceyueth the deuyſes
of the mynde, well if hee were ſo ſubtle and expert
as to perceyue it, yet his ſhamfaſtneſſe intermingled
wyth feare, woulde let him to attempte
that, whych I deſyre ſo much, and (as
it may be, he will not refuſe mee) therefore I
will be the fyrſt that ſhall expell this feare and
baſhefulneſſe that ſo impeach my ioye, ſyth it
is I that haue felte the amorous flames, and
ſuffred the prickes of the ſharpe Arrowes of
Cupido, I hope that although the enterpryſe
be great and daungerous, hee will not refuſe
me, and that if my great bewty cannot mooue
him, if my ardent and fine imbracements cannot

kyndle the fyre in hys harte, nor my loue
in hys Breaſte, yet I knowe well by what
Chaſe and Nettes▪ I muſte take hym, then
chaunce what maye, if I dye for it, I wyll

mouth, (ſyth imbaſſage is perillous in a matter
of ſuch conſequence as this is) that which
I ſuffer for hym, alſo I wyll deſyre hym to
remedye my paſſyon, otherwyſe I haue already
excogitate the meanes to prouyde for my
vnhappy and deſperate lyfe, hauing found out
this plot in her mynde, the iuceſtious and vyle
woman ſearching wyth herſelfe, by what

of the ſtringes of the inſtrument, during
which the Marchyones made her voyce

               THe Song ended, ſhee begynneth to ſearch

and ſheweth well by her countenaunce that
thy

                   was no other thing, then the common
paſſyon that ſhe imagined, that ſo troubled her
thoughts and exte
                     •
                   your countenaunce, in the

ende vanquiſhed with the extreame deſyre of
her pleaſure, ſhee commaundeth the Damſell
whome ſhe ſo greatly truſted, to goe cauſe the
County Hugenes alone to come vnto her, for a
matter of great importaunce, & whych ſhoulde
very well content him, to whom the Damſell
obeyes, not withoute great ſuſpition of that,
which came to paſſe, for it was ſhee alone that
perceyued the wanton lookes and ſighes, ſent
forth by her Miſtreſſe, when ſhe was amaſed
to beholde the Countye, before whome when
the Damſell was come, ſhe ſayeth vnto hym:
Syr, my Ladye deſyres you to come talke a
little wyth her, for a thing that appertayneth
to you, whome you ſhall fynde in her chamber
attending with good deuotyon, as I beleeue,
to communicate vnto you, a thing that hitherto
hath not bene knowne, deuyſed, or peruſed
by you. The Prince taking no regarde to the
wordes of the Meſſenger, but guyded by hys
miſhap, goeth to the Chamber of the Marchiones:
During this, the Damſell that wente to
ſeeke the Countye, knowing well that the inormitie
of the caſe that ſhe imagyned, doeth
withhold her to goe agayne to her Miſtreſſe,
becauſe ſhe would not impeach the ioy of her,
whoſe lyfe ſhe had ſeene led 
                     •
                  yth ſo much ſorrow,
re
                     •
                  yreth into a wardrope, where ſhe (preſaging
the miſfortune of the faire couple) being
confounded with teares, in the end agreuaded

wyth ſorrowe, and ſet vppon by ſlumbring,
through wearyneſſe fell on ſleepe. Then the
County being entered into the Chamber of his
fayre mother, ſhe comming towardes him, to
receyue him very courteouſlye, taketh him by
the hand, and cauſeth him to ſyt down by her.
But when it came to the poynt, that the fayre
Lady would haue addreſt her trayne, her hart
beginnes to leape within her belly, her ſences
do denye to fulfyll the offyce of the exteryoure
members, for her tongue was mute, her eyes
deiecte, and her vyſage chaunged into ſuche a
Vermillyon, that ſhe would haue abaſhed the
vant corrour of the Sonne, and ſurely this
chaunge was cauſed of two contraryes, that
is to wit, loue, and ſhame, the one woulde haue
her ſhew forth her greefe, the other direct contrary,
by naturall wyll and inclynation, but in
the end, the more vnperfect and leſſe puiſſaunt
in the good cauſe, became victoryous, for the
Lady, after ſhe had ſyghed a good ſpace, with
out ſpeaking any worde, wearye of her vndiſcreete
ſylence, as ſhee thoughte it, in the ende
breakyng her ſylence, wyth a looke whyche
was ſuffycyente to enter into the depth of hys
harte, (ſuche was her cunning to mooue hym
to compaſſyon) hauing her voyce tremblyng,
and euill aſſured, for the contynuaunce of that
whych ſhe felte in her mynde, and ſuſtayning
dyuers affections that mooued her ſpirite, ſhe

tooke the yong Prynce delicately by the fayre
hande, ſaying vnto him: My Lorde, if I had
not manye occaſyons to addreſſe my lamentations,
and iuſt complaynts, you may beleeue, if
it pleaſe you, y• I am not ſo vnſhamfaſte, as to
deceyue your eares, and by myne own meanes
to manifeſt before you a thing, that although
as it may be, you ſhal thinke it very ſtraunge,
yet it doth touch you ſo neare, that for the loue
which I beare you, that are more deare vnto
me then you thinke, I cannot, nor am able
to keepe it from you, for in ſo doing, I ſhoulde
wilfully betray you, & ſhould doe both againſt
my conſcience, and the duty of her towardes
you, that holdeth the place wherein I am, I
know you are not ignoraunte of the lyfe that
the Marques your Father hath ledde, ſynce
the death of her of good memory, your Ladye
and mother, and what troupe of Baſtardes euery
one ſeeth at this day in your houſe, which
if God doe not otherwyſe prouyde, ſhall vſe no
leſſe inhumanitye one day towards you, then
your father did once towards his Coſyn, the
lawfull inheritour of this countrey, whome he
expulſed, & ſent in exile into Candy, for I ſee as
well the ſmall account they make of you, as of
me, which haue wiſhed a hundered tunes y• I
had neuer come into this country, not only for
the greefs that I haue felt, but alſo for that I
forſee the miſchiefs that are prepared for you,

if you doe not wyſely preuent thē, I neither do
nor would haue you think, that I counſell you
to fil your hands with the blood & life of him, of
whom you had your beginning, but I would
haue you vnderſtand, that I giue you this aduyſe,
that you open the eye of your intendmēt,
to forſee to what end theſe things may turne,
and as for mee, there is nothing in my power,
wherwith I will fayle to ſuccour you, ſith it is
euen you, to ſay the truth (ſaith ſhe) imbraſing &
kiſſing him, my deare friend, whom I loue & eſteme
more then any man that liues, which if it
pleaſe you▪ I wil cauſe you know by experiēce.
O would to God yt the hower of my alyās had
ſucceded after my mind, truely no other ſhould
haue inioyd the daughter of y• Lord Maleteſt,
then the County Hugnes, for when my Lord
& Father did intreate with me for the mariage
of the Lorde of Ferraria, it was you whome
he talked with me of, & not the Marques, God
pardon the folly of him, that ſo fouly deceyued
me, ſyth y• vnyon of vs two had bene far better
denyſed, thē with your Father, the age equal, &
the cōfyrmity of maners y• might haue conioyned
vs with a perpetual band, which now am
bound againſt my wil to him y• deſpiſeth me, &
who it is that loueth & cheriſheth y• mothers of
them yt one day, as it may chance, ſhall depryue
you both of your honour & lyfe, then thinke my
Lord what ſorrow it ſhould be to me, in that I

had loſt the meanes to bee perpetually yours,
and conſyder what ſhould be my lyfe to come,
(louing you as I doe) if I ſhould ſee the ruine,
and deſtructyon of your eſtate. Alas, God
is my wytneſſe, wyth what anguyſhe I open
theſe my ſecretes vnto you, for the deſyre that
I haue, that you mighte be wholy myne, as I
am yours, is ſo ingrafted in my harte, that only
death muſt make the ſeperation, in ſaying ſo
ſhe kyſſeth and imbraſeth him of an other faſhyon,
then a chaſte woman doth imbrace her
Parentes and familliars, and then ſhe retourneth
to her former purpoſes, ſaying: Therfore
my Lorde and greatly beloued friend, bee not
you the occaſyon of the death of her that ſeketh
to increaſe your honour, and thereby doth render
her ſelfe of a moſt vnhappy, the fortunates
Lady that liues at this day, haue pittie of her
which ſo liberally and prodigallye offereth her
ſelfe vnto you, but if crueltye haue more place
in you, then the prayers I make vnto you, and
the ſynguler loue that I beare you, kill, kill, I

whych will be the occaſyon both of your diſhonour,

louer, that yo

                   had in this world.
               The County no leſſe abaſhed of the words,
then of the wanton imbraſinges of his fayre

mother, was ſo far beſyde himſelfe, that without
aunſwering, or hauing power to departe
from her, remayned no leſſe immoueable, then
was once the wyfe of Lot, tourned into a piller,
and Rocke of Salte. The Marchyones
who was excellent fayre, yong, tender, and delycate,
and whoſe lokes were ſo fyne and gracious,
that I beleeue, if the moſt wylfull and
abſtinent of the Philoſophers of former tyme,
had felte the temptation of an obiect ſo fayre
and celeſtyall, they would haue quyte lefte, forſaken,
and forgotten, the contemplacyon of naturall
cauſes, to haue geuen themſelues to execute
the very effectes of nature. I thinke alſo
if the Daughter of Mynos, had bene of like

                  wty, good graces, attemptes and intyſementes,
as was this Lady, I doubt not at al.
But that her Hypolite, although he were frowarde
or lunetyque, woulde haue enioyed and
cheriſhed her, and lefte Diana, to haue ſowne
his ſeedes in the Garden of her, that with
ſuch inſtaunce requyred him of mercy. Thys
fayre Temptareſſe, then ſeeing her louer in
ſuch alterations, and ſo ſurpriſed with ſhamefaſteneſſe,
alſo becauſe he had not ſhowne any
ſemblaunce of diſpleaſure, with any thing ſhe
had done, ſhe purpoſeth to paſſe further, and to

thoughtes, ſhoulde not meaſure with reaſon

the greatneſſe of his miſdeedes, & the abhomination
of the ſin which he committed againſt
his father, in vſing the perſon of her, in whom
the blood of his had bene mingled. Likewiſe,
becauſe he ſhould not diſcouer the great perrill
& danger, wherinto he caſt himſelfe headlong,
in taking the vnhapy counſel of y• wanton coū
                  ſeller.
Therfore ſhe caſt her arme ouer y• necke

who being once intiſed by her vnſeemely
pronocations, & wicked doings, not only fulfilled
y• which ſhe ſ on aughtily deſyred, but was

Mark and behold here the ſecond Acte of the
Tragedy, that thou mayſt ſee, if the ioyes and
pleaſures of men may be pertual, & if it be not
more a doe for the Nobles to keepe ſecrete
their

                  olies, then for the meane ſort to manifeſt

them, and ſurely they are a great deale ſooner
eſpyed in the chiefe of the common weale,
then in the members that are more weake,
and of leſſe puiſſaunce, for where the heade is
troubled, it is vnpoſſible that the members
ſhoulde not feele ſome apprehenſyon of their
miſhappe and ſorrowe. This is the cauſe
why men intreate alwayes of Prynces, and
make ſo ſmall accoumpte of the doinges of the
pleban ſorte, the memory of whome vaniſheth
away ſo ſoons as the wynde. But for that
theſe two coulde not well deuyſe all thinges
themſelues, wythout hauing a thyrde perſon,
they intende to imparte their affayres to the
Damſell, that was ſent to ſeeke the County,
and which doubted of that, whiche they had
done togythers. To her then, after the County
was departed the Chamber, enamoured
and inflamed of his louing mother, the Marchyones,

more gay, then accuſtomed, ſaying: My deare
friend, you haue ſeene in what eaſe I haue

receiued during the preſence of the Marques,
but GOD hath ſo prouyded that hee is abſent
for certayne dayes, to the ende that I
ſhould make prouyſyon for the tyme to come:
of that which I ſtand in neede of, and by this
his abſence, might get my ſelfe that goodneſſe
which ſhould ende all my euils, I haue choſen

me ſuch a louer as nature cannot ſhape a more
perfect, eyther in bewty, liberallitye, courteſy,
or worthyneſſe, and ſo n

you hytherto both wyſe and faythfull, to keepe
my ſecretes in ſuch ſort, as they oughte to bee,

of my former affections, and the ſymple

doe deſerue, and as the good and affectionate
amitie, whych I haue borne you requyreth.
And as ſhe would haue cōtinued her purpoſe,
the Damſell impacyent to be ſollicited, ſayeth
vnto her: Would that God, Madame, had cut
of the threade of my yeares, when I fyrſt ſet
my foote in this vnhappye houſe, for by that

cannot forget her Nobillitie, and the heauens
angry for an acte ſo infamous, and an iniurye
ſo deteſtably committed, both agaynſte God,
and agaynſte the Father and huſband of both
the offenders, ſtyrred vp a more wyly and ſubtle
diſcouerer of ſecrete faults, which is Time,
who did the offyce of a good Seruaunt, after
that by the very fooliſhneſſe of the two louers,
their folly was made euydent, they gouerning
themſelues ſo vndiſcretly togythers, and with
ſo ſmall reſpecte of perſons, tyme, and place,
that in the ende blynded in their pleaſure, and
glutted in their eaſe, they thought that Tyme
woulde alwayes haue bene ſo fauourable, as
ſhe had bene almoſte the ſpace of two yeares.
Now let alone the Marques of Ferraria, that
doubted nothing of the great diſhonoure that

his ſonne did vnto him, and of the falſe connaye
of his wyfe, which ſent him vnto Cornouall
wythout a Boate. It chanced that a y
                     •
                  oman
of the chamber of the myſerable County,
beganne to ſuſpecte ſomething of that whyche
paſſed betwyxte the two infortunate 
                     •
                  onglinges,
for he ſaw ordinarilye that as ſoone as
the Marques was gone anye nighte into the
Towne, to vyſyte ſome of hys Concubynes,
the Countye fayled not to goe all alone oute of
his Chamber, whych was the cauſe that he aſſured
him of his doubte, and therefore purpoſyng
to ſeeke out the truth (beholde the iuſte
iudgements of God) which ſeeing the mallice
that men haue to commit euill and deteſtable
ſinnes, often tymes giueth ſpeech to yong Infantes,
or wyſedome vnto Beaſtes, to publiſhe
it. For this cauſe hee beginneth to ſpye all the
deedes, countenaunces, actes, and wordes of
the Prince: and the enterpryſe of the gallant
ſucceeded ſo well, that after he had be thought
of it, beeing in a Wardrope adioyning to the
Chamber of the Marchyones, marke the dyuyn
                     •
                  
permiſſyon. The ſinne being come to the
rypeneſſe of hys abhominatyon, he eſpyed by
chaunce a ſmall hole in the wall, whyche was
iuſt ouer agaynſt the Bed, wherein ſhe lay ordinarily,
by this Creuyſe then, the cleare eyed
ſpye, hoped to ſee that, whych ſo long tyme he
had deſyred and imagyned, and as he ſaw the

enemy of nature before him, he makes a thouſand
ſygnes of the croſſes▪ with ſuch an abaſhment,
that then hee woulde not beleeue, that
which he ſaw euidentlye with his eyes, in the
end beholding the thing more merely, and perceyuing
that he was not deceyued at all, hee
ſayeth very ſo
                     •
                  tly to himſelfe, and by God it
ſhall not be long, before I will alſo make the
Marques to vnderſtand it, to the end, he may
puniſh the one of hys foule temeritie, and the
other of her great wantonnes, & laſciuious incontynencye,
now he attending oportunitye to
cauſe the Marques to view this pittyous and
v
                     •
                  ruely Spectacle, behold it chaunſed two or
three dayes after, the infortunate Prynce, not
doubting the treaſon, which the yeoman of hys
chamber did cōmit, that ſo ſone as he ſaw hys
father gone into the ſtable to view his Horſes,
euen then he wēt into the chāber of the Lady,
to continue the way begon, within the bed of
his Lord & father, but his Argus which ſlepte
not at al, following him by little and little, and
hauing ſeene him enter the liſtes, returneth towards
the father, to ſhew him that, which ſo
long tyme he had deſyred, & to make him iudge
of the vnfortunate Louers. This Traytor (although
his fact hath ſome aparēce of Iuſtice)
arriued before the Marques, ſaith vnto him, al
abaſhed & aſtonied for yt he had ſene: My Lord,
if time did ſuffer me to ſhew and declare one of

the moſt wicked factes that euer chaunced in
Italy, I ſhould cauſe you to maruayle, and (as
it might be) by reſyting ſo ſtraunge a thing, I
ſhould make your cheekes to bluſh, and inrage
your hart, ſo abhominable is the caſe, but becauſe
I would not make you looſe yt diſcourſe,
may it pleaſe your noble Lordſhip to come alone,
whether I will conduct you, & where you
ſhall ſee with your eyes, that which I cannot
commodyouſly reſyte vnto you in order. The
Marques which was a mā of a good corage, &
deſyrous to know rare & ſtrange things, went
with the guyde euē to the place, where he ſaw
the act playde, that afterward was the death
of the chiefe perſōs in the Tragedy, then ſayth
the ſpye vnto the Marques, I beſeeche you my
Lord, to contemplate a little through this creuiſe,
what lyfe they leade in your abſence, that
ſith you are preſent, the diſloyalty of thē that be
moſt 
                     〈◊〉
                   vnto you, is ſo euidently ſhown. The
good Marques had no ſooner looked through
the 
                     〈◊〉
                   then he ſpyed his ſonne interlaſed &

                     ••
                  foldē about the neck of the Marchiones, and
the wantontoyes of the Ladye towardes the
County, the Father of whome was ſo conſtant,
that hee attended to what ende theſe
imbraſementes and toyes would
                     •
                   come, but
when hee ſawe the Game woulde redounde
to his diſaduantage, and to the perpetual infamye
of hys hoaſe, with great payne he obſerued
himſelfe from being ouercome wyth rage,

and that he had not broke open the dore of the
Chamber, vpon the Campe, where were theſe
couple of infortunate Louers, to haue cauſed
them to dye vpon the very fact, alwayes the
paſſyon of his mynde, was ſo penetrable, that
he coulde not by a good ſpace remooue from
thence, but remayned there wholy troubled
and confuſed in teares, running downe along
hys bearde, that now beginneth to waxe
white, in the end, euaporating the order of hys
harte, he began to ſay.
               Alas, vnhappy olde man, that I nowe ſhall
be, that notwythſtanding the flower of thyne
Age, arte diſhonoured by thyne owne bloud,
and the ſubſtaunce of thyne entrayles, what
is it the onely ſonne (amongeſt them that bee
lawfull) which hath vnlawfullye abuſed thy
Spouſe? ſhal I be both the witneſſe, Party,
and Iudge in this cauſe? and in executing of
this iudgement, that I muſt needes do both by
law and iuſt diſpleaſure, I ſhall put to death
two perſons, that I loue beſte in this worlde:
No, no the amitie of Maryage ſha
                     •
                   ende here,
towards her, that hath put oute the lighte of
my honour, and hath blotted the reputation
common to vs both, and the charitye of the father
towardes the ſonne, ſhall loſe his force in
me, ſyth the chylde in vſurping the Bed of the
Father, hath geuen coniecture of his will, to
take awaye the lyfe of hym, of whome he had

his owne, and of whome hee hath ſtayned the
honour. What if once a Romaine Captayne,
hath puniſhed, as it might be, to ſeuerelye hys
ſonne? in that hee had ſurpaſſed his commandemente,
touching a certayne expedition in
deedes of Armes, whereof although hee had
gloryouſly attayned the wyſhed end of his deſyres,
then what ſhall I doe, beholding my ſelf
ſo vyly betrayed? and ſo euill diſhonoured by
him, whyche oughte to bee the reuenger of the
cryme, whereof my eyes haue ſeene the execution,
I beſeech God that pytty may not moue
my harte to pardon him of this fault, or to diſſemble
this great and extreme hartebreache,
that lyuing, cauſeth my death, and ſo reuengyng
a pryuate iniurye, I ſhall puniſh the moſt
abhomynable ſynne, that a man can thinke.
Then for the quyetneſſe of my mynde, and example
of Iuſtyce to the poſteritye, my ſonne
ſhall dye wyth the vnſhamefaſt loue, whiche
was cauſe of all thys, and by whych meanes
I ſhall depart from my only lawfull begotten
ſonne, and from my honour, whych is more
dere then chyldren, riches, or lyfe. The ſorrowfull
and inraged father with this deliberation,
ſeekyng to execute his deuyſe, his ſonne departed
into the baſe Court of the Caſtle, wythout
thinking of the perrill, or ruyne, that hys myſfortune
dyd prepare for him, and their bandes
the Ball with the Gentlemē of his age, where

was greater companye of people to ſee the
playe, then were there of long tyme before,
for I think, that ſome coniecture of the future
Spectacle had broughte thyther thys route,
to the ende that wyth more ſhame, the County
and hys inceſtyous Louer ſhoulde be impryſoned.
Alſo theſe be the Menaces, wherewyth
God threatneth the wycked, that their pryuye
ſinnes committed in the obſcurity of the night,
ſhall be one day puniſhed openly, and to the
ſighte of all the people, duryng this then, that
the vnfortunate Prynce (more braue and
ioyfull then accuſtomed) did contynue hys
playe, behold there comes the keeper of the
Caſtle, wyth a good troupe of Archers, wel appoynted,
he in the preſence and hearing of euery
one, addreſſing him to the Countye, ſayeth
vnto him: O Prince it is nowe full tyme that
you make ready your ſelfe to come before other
then theſe be, where you muſt aunſwere to the
coniurations, Fellonyes, conſpiracies, & facts,
agaynſt the perſon of my Lord the Marques,
your Father, by whoſe commandement, ſayth
he, putting his hand to his coller, I make and
cōſtitute you his Priſoner, I am ſorry for your
miſfortune, & more ſorrowful that it ſhould bee
I that muſt keepe you in pryſon, always truſt
in your great ſimplicitie, & likewyſe, if it pleaſe
you, excuſe that whych I doe, being conſtrayned
by him, which hath power both ouer mee,

and you: O extreme force, and rygor of the conſcience,
which moueſte ſo lyuely the hartes of
them, that feele themſelues guilty of any fault,
that the blaſt of euery wynd that blowes, & by
the wagging of euery lefe that they ſee moue,
they thinke they behold before their eyes a torment,
and a contynuall puniſhment, that wyll
neuer ſuffer them to take any reſt, whereof
comes the great griefe, and the ſmal aſſurance
that they haue of themſelues, whych are ſo
troubled by the very interyour iudgemente of
their owne ſpirite, that they gyue ſure wytnes
of that thing, whych (as it might haue chaunced)
otherwyſe had bene in doubte, ſo the pore
Countye ſeeing himſelfe ſommoned to go eſpouſe
and defyle another bed, then that wherin
heretofore he had receiued ſo much contentment,
fayled not then to thynke of the accroſyng
of hys euils, and the ſmall hope that hee
might or could haue to be delyuered, therefore
halfe attached wyth diſpayre, hee ſayeth vnto
the Proueſt. Go forward Captain, whether it
ſhall ſeeme good vnto you, for of long tyme
I haue attended no other intreaty of him, then
that whyche I now ſee prepared for me. No,
no, my Lord, ſayth the Proueſt, haue a good
harte, God is able to ayde you, & puiſſaunt to
make euery one to know y• right of your cauſe,
alſo my Lorde the Marques wyll doe nothing
agaynſt you, without the coūſel of y• moſt wiſe

and learned men of his houſe, whych oughte to
cauſe you to hope of ſome better hap, then you
thinke of, & then he conducteth the Prince into
the great Tower of the Caſtle, which ſtandeth
iuſt agaynſt the Porte Delyon. And duryng
this tyme, there were ſome gone in lyke ſorte,
and by lyke commandment to ſeeke the Marchyones,
as they had done the Countye, who
then was amongeſt her Gentlewomen, playing
this ſong, as the Prognoſtication of her
miſfortune, and the Prophecy of the common
Buryall, that vnyted after their death, the executed
body both of her, and the Countye.
               
                  THe man by councell of the Gods,
                  In this low earth thats placed:
                  Hath not ſo many ioyfull dayes,
                  But one miſhap hath them defaced.
               
               
                  And vnto whome hath not Fortune aſsigned,
                  For euery ioy, a hundereth greefes to taſte:
                  Why ſhould I then my ſelfe ſo ſore annoy?
                  And ſhead ſo many teares, day and night in waſte.
               
               
                  The Pleaſure which my nouriſhment doth giue,
                  And cake my weary troubled mynde doth caſe:
                  That only ioy which ſhould my lyfe ſuſtayne,
                  Is fled away to ſhorten now my dayes.
               
               
                  Alas (O God) alas, what meaneth this chaunce?
                  That of myne ende ſo ſure a ſygne to be:
                  
                     
As cake a token playne of greefe for to enſue,
                  Of much vnreſt and great miſchaunce to me.
               
               
                  What muſt I ſee of him the cruell death,
                  By whome my perfectneſſe doth come:
                  O God, O God, that all things doeſt behold,
                  Thy holy will for euermore be done.
               
               
                  And cauſe thou me vnperfect wight,
                  To ſee thy gloryous throne in higheſt Skye:
                  Syth euery one alyke by death ſhall ende,
                  And hyeſt State on earth, that lyues, muſt dye.
               
               
                  AS ſoone as the poore Lady atchieued
the end, the Marſhall of the Houſhold
vſing the ſame ambaſſage to her, as
before to the Prince, carried her Priſoner vnto
another tower, a good ſpace from that, wherin
the Prince was incloſed.
               The Marques during this ſtyrre, beholding
all the worlde aſtonyed, to ſee a thyng of ſo
much maruayle, and a Spectacle ſo cruell, as
the impryſonment of hys ſonne, that ſhoulde
one daye ſuceeede him, and of hys wife, whom
he had ſo derely loued, becauſe men ſhould not
accounte hys facte vnlawfull, or cruell Tyranny,
he procured ſylence to be commaunded, and
before a great company of his Barrons, and
houſhold Gentlemen, with a graue Maieſty,
that exteryouſly gaue euident token of his interyour
greefe: After he had ſpent an infynite

number of teares, accompanyed with ſorrowfull
ſighes, he began to ſay: What one amōgſt
you all, my good and louing friends, can well
brooke that, whyche is lately done by mee,
both vppon my Sonne, and vpon the Marchyoues,
for that you know not the true occaſyon,
and by that meanes, you eſteeme mee an
vnkynde huſbande, and a Father ſeuere and
cruell, agaynſt all right and reaſon, and would
it might pleaſe God that your playntes were
lawfull, and that I had done wrong in thys,
truelye then my deare friendes, I ſhould haue
no occaſyon to make you partakers of my heauyneſſe,
nor of the ſheddyng of thoſe teares
that you ſee runne downe along the face of
hym, that wythout them, cannot expreſſe
vnto you, the iuſte cauſe of hys dule, and
alſo the greate reaſon of hys ſo ſodayne crueltye,
(if it oughte not to be named equitye)
that neuer heretofore hath ſhewed any effecte
of hys mallyce, towardes anye man that
lyues, if fyrſte hee haue not gyuen hym the occaſyon,
for it is no leſſe prayſe worthye in a
Prynce, to gouerne hys people wyth gentleneſſe,
equytye, and clemencye, then to puniſhe
the ſedicious, and diſquyetors of the peace, becauſe
that ſuch pacience ſhewed to one, ſhould
not bee the common ruyne of all the whole
people. Thys is it, wherevnto he oughte to

extende all hys force, no leſſe to chaſten the temerritye
of the foolyſhe, then to recompence
the fydelitie of them, whyche hath ſerued hym
faythfully, ſhewing all the offyce of obedience
towardes their Lordes. What if the law doe
inioyne this duety in the Vaſſall and ſubiecte▪
towards the naturall and liege Lorde, nature
conioyned with the lawe, doe conſtrayne and
more ſtreightly bynde the infants, which owe
to their Parents honour, obedience, piety, & al
good ſuccours, not only of that whiche is exteriour,
but alſo of the interyour it ſelfe, which is
the good will and perfect amitye, by which the
harte of the Sonne ought to be vnyted wyth
the pleaſure and wil of the Father. But O immortall
God, what Father would be ſo pittious
and merciful, that ſeing the Knyfe of hys
ſonne vpon his owne throate, and coulde ſtaye
him, would ſuffer him to depryue hym of lyfe?
But what? lyfe oughte to be equall to honour,
for the atchieuing and attayning whereof, all
the noble and gentle myndes haue once deſpyced,
and yet do deſpyſe their lyues? Alas my
friends, the complaynt which I make before
you, is againſt my ſonne & wyfe, the forgetfulneſſe
of whome, is extended euen vnto the defacyng
of myne honoure, wherin both I, and
my predeceſſors haue paſſed our age, I wyll
bring you no other wytneſſe then myne owne
eyes, that haue ſeene one of the moſte abhominable

and wicked facts that a man can think,
it is that which I cannot ſpeake, withoute an
vnmeaſurable greefe, and without hanging
my countenaunce, for the ſhame hee hath done
me. That is, the County Hugnes hath defyled
the nuptiall bed of the Marques of Ferrarya,
his Father, and the ſoueraign Lord of you all,
it is he that hath polluted the houſe, that is
counted in the raygne of the moſte noble in all
Europe, this is he that inceſtyouſly hath vyolated
the ſecretes and pru
                     •
                  ties, the entrance
whereof, were lawfully permitted to none, but
me alone. To whome ſhall I complayne? and
who ſhall reuenge me of thys iniurye? Alas,
my harte breaketh, my ſences fayle me, and my
forces are weakned, only there remaines a deſyre
to do Iuſtice, not that it might be condign
to the abhomination of the faulte, but that I
might thereby take awaye this blot from my
ſtocke, and moderate a little the greefe that
prickes me, and whiche yet ſerueth for the repentance
of them that haue offended the Maieſty
deuyne ſo greououſlye, that their doyngs
haue giuen cauſe to them that come after, to
blaſe abroade the follye of their youth, and in
ſaying ſo, his ſpeech fayled him, and ouercome
wyth ſorrow, and the unpacience of his cholor,
he founded in the armes of his Gentlemē, who
carryed him into his chamber, greatly abaſhed
of the wickedneſſe of the two offēders, which

they beleeued, as wel for the reuerences of him
that did wytneſſe to haue ſeene it, as for the remembraunces
of the impudent lookes, and laſciuious
toyes of the Marchiones, towardes
the Countye, that made them thinke it was
ſhe that made the pit, wherein both ſhe and the
Countye were intrapped, as ſone as the Marques
was come to himſelf, there was no man
ſo bolde that durſt ſay any word vnto him, but
depending wholye of the wyll of their Lorde,
were of that aduyſe, that the proceſſe ſhould be
quickly diſpatched, and that Iuſtyce ſhould be
done to the two Patientes, as well for their
comfortes, as to gyue ſome contentmente to a
Father rightly duſpleaſed agaynſte his ſonne,
and as a huſband deadlye hating the Palyardyſe
of his wyfe, towardes whome he ſente
one of his Counſellers, wyth two good Father
Fryers, men well lyked of the people, both for
their lyfe and learning, the one to carrye the
heauy and ſorrowfull newes of his death, and
the others to mooue hym to repentance of his
ſynnes, and to pray to God to haue mercye on
hys ſoule. As ſoone as they were come before
the yong Prynce, who ſeeing the Counceller,
and hearing the ſentence of his death, hee began
to ſay, weeping very tenderly. Ah vnhappye
fleſh, and fylthye deſyres, it is for thy pleaſures
that I muſt dye this daye. O vnhappye
wretche that I am, not for that I dye, but becauſe

I am the procurer of his choler, & cauſe
of his dule, & for that I haue ſet ſuch trouble in
his houſe, as ſhall not ſo well, & ſo ſone be forgotten
as I would wyſh. Alas my Lord & father,
pardon this deteſtable offēce of him that
hath vſed himſelf otherwiſe toward you, then
the chyld ought towards y• father, I cōfeſſe I
am the moſt myſerable, that euer was born of
a mother, & the moſt deteſtable yt the Sunne
ſhyneth on this daye. Alas good Lorde, ſuffer
not my ſoule to be puniſhed, ſeruing for the paſture
of that vyle ſerpent & deuouring Lyon,
that doth nothing but go about to deceiue and
invyron vs, & cauſe vs to fall into his lake. O
Lord haue mercy, haue mercy on me, & ſuffer
not the bloud of thy ſonne to be ſhed in vayne
for me. Alas I muſt dye, not for the confeſſing
of the fayth, and glorifying of thy name before
men, but for my owne wickedneſſe, & the multitude
of my demerites, yt which next after the
great wickedneſſe committed againſt thy dyuyne
maieſty, doth greeue me moſt, is the ſorrowe
of him that doth, and will redounde to
my miſchiefe & diſhonour. But O my God, I
beſeech thee to comfort him, & giue me ſtrēgth
pacientlye to abyde this infamous & cruell puniſhment,
that I ſee euen redy before my eyes.
The Counſeller ſeeing the repentaunce of the
Prince, moued with cōpaſſyon, begā to wepe,
& departed out of the pryſon, went to make report
thereof to the Marques, who aunſwered

him, it is not now time to become a good chriſtyan,
ſyth he cānot eſcape the iuſt vengeance
of God, by the myniſter of his humain iuſtyce,
and I beſeech God that hee will pardon hys
ſynnes, & receyue him amongſt the number of
his elect: ſaying ſo, left of, not able to beare the
ſorrow which did greeue him, for the remembraunce
of the approching death of his ſonne,
wherfore it was ordayned that they ſhould be
quickly diſpatched, one in ye ſight of the other,
and this was done, for yt the Marques would
here no admonition, for he heard the ſentence
was extended as well vppon the Countye, as
vpon her, that had made no ſute for her lyfe,
becauſe ſhe ſaw they had cōdemned ye county,
then in the end ſeing ſhe had done the faulte,
ſhe appoynteth with her ſelf to receyue death,
in as good part as ſhe could, which was giuē
to euery of them in their tower, within a mynute
of an houre, not without an infynite nū
                  ber
of teares ſhead and beſprent, as well by
the Marques, which could not diſſemble hys
affection, as by al thē of his houſe, that vniuerſally
loued the fayre couple of infortunate Louers,
y• vertue of whom, this vlot except, could
well haue no compariſon, but a lyttle Leuen,
as ſayeth the Apoſtle, doth eaſyly rayſe, ſeaſon
and ſower a great peece of dow: likewyſe, a
vyce ſo ſlaunderous, doeth obfuſcate all the
brightneſſe of the former vertues, and impoyſoneth
the good ſauour of all the forpaſſed life.
               
                  
Theſe two Patients being executed, whylſt
men were preparing of rych and accuſtomable
Funerals, they were broughte into the baſe
Court of the Pallas, to the ende all the world
ſhould ſee and beholde the cauſe of their death,
that yet renewed the teares and complaynts
of men, as well for the one as for the other, bewayling
the one for hys worthyneſſe, the other
for her curteſye, and them both for their great
bewtye, and youth, wherein they were, for as
yet, the more aged of them, had not attayned
the age of two and twenty yeares.
               After this the Marques cauſed to bee prepared
a rych and ſumptuous furnyture for their
funerals, and with ſuch pompe as their greatneſſe
did requyre, their bodyes were broughte
to be buryed in the couent of Saynt Frances,
and there was erected a Tomb to be the common
bed of the bodyes of them, whoſe hartes
had bene ſurely conioyned togythers, when
they were alyue, ſo theſe two myſerable creatures
had a ſmall eaſe, for the induring of ſo
great a puniſhment, and for all the contentment
and ſatiſfaction of their deſyres, they
had this only good, that by one kynd of death,
they both ſhould ende, and haue their bones
enioy one Sepulcure togither. Here it is good
to be aduyſed, how and wyth what counſels
men ought to forſee thinges, and their accurrenſes,
before they be executed, here maye you

gather alſo what is the nature and condition
of ſynne, which once ingrafted in the harts of
men, ſpreadeth his rootes ſo broade, that by
great payne it cannot be exterped, but by the
diſolucyon and death of the ſubiect, whereby
they are cheefe cauſe of their owne ruyne. A
good example certaynelye for the youth of this
age, which without aduyſement of the daungers
that the fleſh & the Prynce of this worlde
doe prepare for them, to their great ſhame, vſe
pryuate companye wyth them, that be of their
kyndred, wythout aduyſemente that
the moſte ſage haue once fayled in
theſe doinges, and haue perpetrated
the thinges that are
vnworthy to be thought,
and puniſhable only by
death in them that
commytte
them.
