            THE EPISTLE TO
the Chriſtian Reader.
            
               IT is a ſtraight charge, which that maiſter
giueth to his ſeruants in deliuering
to them his money, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,
Negotiamini donec veniam, The
conſideration whereof as it hath ſet all
Gods ſeruants formerly on worke, in
their times to turne & put forth their
talents, that they might giue account with gain: ſo the great
vantage that they haue already gotten, cannot excuſe after
ſeruants, in after times from this ſpirituall traffique: what
though their receipts be leſſe? yet they carefully imploy what
they haue▪ that their maister alſo may receiue of them an anſwerable
increaſe.
            And this is the cauſe, why we in like ſort, in conſcience of
this charge, at this time put our one talent into the banke,
which we haue heeretofore (for the moſt part) imployed in
our priuate Miniſtery; and would now with the fiſhers, when
fiſhes waxe ſcant at the ſhore, launch a little further into the
deepe; and with the Marchants, thriuing a little at home, aduenture
further abroad, to try in other coaſts how wee can
make our markets. In this our preſent trauell, wee haue followed
the manner of ſuch Traders, making proofe with
theſe new wares, what hope there will be of venting abroad

more of the ſame kind, which we are very ready to doe, and
that with ſpeed, if we may know them for the profit ſaleable;
but if otherwiſe, as we may ſaue further labor in this courſe,
ſo our loſſe ſhall not be much by ſo little: yea heereby we ſhall
gaine ſomewhat to our ſelues, euen a comfortable anſwere to
make at that day of account, that whatſoeuer our ſucceſſe is,
yet ſuch haue our endeuours beene, heereby to doe the beſt
good we can to the Church of God, and with the conſcience
of this wee haue hardened our foreheads againſt the many
cenſures of men, and ſet it as a brazen wall againſt them;
chooſing rather to be accounted of ſuch, fooliſh, vaineglorious,
affecting bookiſhnes, or any thing elſe, as pleaſeth them
in their ſalt humour to vtter, then that not doing the good
wee might, our owne conſciences ſhould condemne vs, yea,
God himſelfe, for euill and vnprofitable ſeruants.
            Now we haue entred vpon the book of the Pſalms, drawn
on hitherto by the great variety of documents and inſtructions,
ſutable to all eſtates of men moſt plentifully contained
heerein, ſo that wee may boldly ſay, there is no condition of any
in proſperity or aduerſity, peace or warres, health or ſicknes,
inward or outward distreſſe, with many particular caſes
in all theſe kinds, but he ſhall finde ſome Pſalmes, which he
may thinke almoſt to haue beene compoſed vpon his owne occaſion,
wherin he may praiſe God, pray vnto him, complaine
and open his particular griefes.
            And for direction heerein, wee referre thee to the diuers
Prefaces both of ancient and late writers, chiefly of Athanaſius,
Baſil the great, Auguſtine and ſome others, who haue
commended this booke vnto vs, as a ſtorehouſe of inſtruction,
and as an Apothecaries ſhop richly furniſhed with all variety
of ſpirituall medicines, by which we may haue remedy againſt
all and euery our ſeuerall diſeaſes and infirmities. And
ſurely, as when Saul was troubled with an euill ſpirit, by aduiſe

of his ſeruants, he ſought out one that might play on the
Harpe, and they found Dauid the ſonne of Iſhai, who plaied
with his hand, and Saul was refreſhed, and had eaſe, the euill
ſpirit departing from him: ſo hath God giuen vnto his
Church the ſame Dauid ſtill, euen the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael,
to modulate, as on his harpe, theſe heauenly ditties, wherunto
if we reſort, to heare, read, ſing and meditate therein, our
restleſſe perturbations, inordinate affections and paſsions
whatſoeuer; which as ſo many euill ſpirits doe vexe vs many
times, ſhall thus depart from vs, and wee ſhall bee caſed and
refreſhed thereby.
            If any ſay now to vs, that very many haue moſt profitably
ſpent their trauell heerein, making expoſitions, annotations,
gloſſes, paraphraſes, enarrations, yea iust and compleat comments
already, in which reſpect what vſe therefore is there of
further labours, heereby rather to ouerloaden the ſtudious,
than to profit them? We anſwer, that moſt true it is, not only
for this booke, but all parts almoſt of holy writ, God (his name
be bleſſed) hath ſtirred vp the harts of many his ſeruants, to
bestow their ſtrength, time, learning and meanes, not onely
to profit the preſent ages wherein they liued, but by their writings
alſo, like carefull Fathers to prouide for poſterity. Concerning
all which,Epiſt. lib. 8. epi. 65. as Seneca to his Lucilius, veneror inuenta
ſapientiae, Inuentoreſ
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   adire tanquam multorum
haereditatem juuat: ſo doe wee honour their wiſe inuentions,
and induſtrious paines, and praiſe God for it, that
others hauing laboured we are entred into their labours: ſed
nobis iſta acquiſita, nobis laborata ſunt. This is no
thanks to vs, who haue theſe as an inheritance already prouided
and gotten to our hands. Agamus igitur (ſaith the
ſame Author) bonum patrem familias, faciamus ampliora
quae accepimus, major iſta haereditas à nobis ad
poſteros tranſcat. Wee ſhall not proue our ſelues good huſbands,

if hauing ſuch a rich patrimony left vnto vs, we ſpend
onely on the ſtocke, and ſeeke not to leaue it ſomewhat augmented
to our poſterity after vs. May we not ſay as it there
followeth: Multum adhuc reſtat operis, multá
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   reſtabit,
nec vlli nato poſt mille ſecula praecludetur occaſio
aliquid adijciendi? There is yet a great deale of this ſpirituall
worke vnperfected, and ſo will be left by vs to after-generations,
neither is it the current of a thouſand yeares
(ſhould the world ſo long endure) which ſhall preuent the
last man of all occaſions to bring ſomething to the perfecting
heereof. Or be it that all things are already found out of the
ancient, in ſuch compleat manner, that they can admit no
additament, hoc tamen ſemper novum erit, vſus, et
Inuentorum ab alijs ſcientia et diſpoſitio: this ſhall alwaies
be new and helpfull in all ages, euen the vſe, methodicall
diſpoſition, & fit application thereof to the preſent times.
            And this is that which we haue ſpecially endeuoured vnto
in this buſineſſe: not ſo much to trye what wee could ſay
more, as out of that ſmall treaſury that God hath put into our
earthen veſſels, to propoſe what we haue, whether old or new,
in that method and forme, which may be beſt & moſt handy
to the readers vſe. For this purpoſe, to the Argument, the vſe
of the Pſalme, and the reſolution thereof prefixed in a table,
we haue ſubioyned a Paraphraſe with the text, and quotation
of other Scriptures ſeruing for the explanation thereof,
noted in the margines: wherein ſo neere as we could, we haue
endeuoured to expreſſe the meaning of the holy ghoſt, with
his owne more plaine phraſes and ſpeeches in other places; not
ſo much ſtudying to find out pleaſant words, as an vpright
writing,Eccleſ. 12. 10. euen the words of truth. Alſo to the explanation
of the words, are annexed the obſeruation of doctrines with
the ſeuerall vſes, that any one may ſee from what fountaine
they flow, and how thence deriued, And theſe are briefly ſet

downe without any further enlargement, more then the quotations
of proofes, out of the holy Scriptures, and that to auoid
tediouſneſſe,Pinedae praefat. in Io. ca. 8. ſect▪ 8. becauſe as one ſaith, Ingenia non deſiderant
repletionem veluti vaſa, ſed accendi volunt ſeu materia,
quo vis inueniendi ſimul cum appetentia veritatis
incitetur. Mens wits do not craue repletion, as veſſels,
but rather a fit matter to ſet on worke their owne inuention,
and to kindle in them a deſire of further ſearching after the
trueth.
            Now for theſe three firſt Pſalmes,Pſal. 119. 130. of them it may be ſaid,
as Dauid elſwhere ſpeaketh of Gods word, that the entrance
into the ſame ſheweth light, ſo theſe the very entrance to this
booke,Aug. tract. 1. in Pſal. 68. light and comfort. For whereas Adam dum raperet
diuinitatem, perdidit foelicitatem, while hee proudly
did catch after deity, to be like God in the knowledge of good
and euill, lost that felicity wherein he was made: ſo heere are
we directed the meanes, how we may recouer the ſame againe,
and this is, rapere ſanctitatem vt inueniā foelicitatē, euen
earneſtly to ſeeke to be like God in holineſſe,2. Pet. 1. 4. and to be partakers
of the diuine nature, by flying the corruption that is in
the world through luſt, ſo ſhall we indeed find true happines.
            And further, leſt the oppoſition againſt Chriſt & his kingdome,
and the many enemies that we ſhall here meet withall,
ſhould either ſuddenly moue vs from all ſtedfastnes, or draw
vs away with the error of the wicked, we may in the ſecond
Pſalme ſee Chriſts kingdome by Gods will and power establiſhed,
and the enemies confounded; and alſo in the third,
behold the Lords taking part with his; and making theirs his
owne quarrell, maintaining his Church againſt their hoſtility,
defending his ſeruants againſt their violence, and in the
middeſt of dangers compaſsing them with deliuerances, that
ſo with confidence,Deut. 33. 29. and tranquilly of minde, they can repoſe
themſelues vpon his aid, who is the ſhield of their helpe, and

the ſword of their glory, ſubduing their enemies. To theſe
therefore doe we ſend thee; to finde heere bleſſedneſſe againſt
thy miſeries, to ſeeke ſafeguard againſt thine aduerſaries, to
gather comfort againſt thy ſorrowes, and to lay thee as it were
aſleepe in godly ſecurity againſt all terrors and feares.
            And briefly for all the reſt,Aug. confeſ. lib. 8. ca. 1. as Auguſtine reſorted to
Simplicianus deſiring him, vt proferret ſibi conferenti
ſecum aeſtus ſuos, quis eſſet aptus modus ad ambulandum
in via Domini; ſo do you much more reſort hither to
this booke: by theſe impart vnto God thy troubles, thine anguiſhes
and boyling affections: by theſe hee will reioyce thy
ſoule: put thy hand in frame, ſay to thy-paſsions as Chriſt
did to the ſea,Mark. 4. 39. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , ceaſe and bee ſtill, and there will
bee tranquillitas magna, a great calme. For the Lords
grace ſhall be with thee,Pſal▪ 32. 8. and 43. 3. hee will inſtruct and teach thee the
way that thou ſhalt goe, he will guide thee with his eye, and
he will ſend forth his light and his truth, that hee may lead
thee and bring thee into his holy mountaine, and to his Tabernacle.
As wee hope, ſo the Lord guide our hearts
to the honouring of his name, to the
loue of him, and the waiting
for of Ieſus Chriſt,
Amen.
         
      
      
         
            
            THE PSALMES
OF DAVID.
            The Preface to the Pſalmes.
            
               THis is the title of the whole booke:Of the title of the booke. and it
may ſeeme to be taken out of the 145.
Pſalme, which is thus intituled, Tehillah
le Dauid. The Hebrewes call it the book
of Pſalmes, Sepher tehillim: and ſo is it
called by Chriſt himſelfe, Luk. 20. 42. It
is called Tehillim, that is, praiſes: for that
this booke containeth manifold praiſes and thankſgiuing vnto
God. Yet not theſe things only, but alſo moſt ſingular inſtructions,
and doctrines of faith, ſpirituall exerciſes of prayer
in al manner of aduerſitie, ſound reioycings in the Lord, heauenly
conſolations to afflicted hearts, prophecies, and diuine
predictions of Chriſt and his Church; and all for the comfort
and edification of Gods people. It hath the title of Pſalmes,
for that theſe things herein contained were in the ſeruice of
the Law to be ſung with muſicall inſtruments: whereupon
the Greekes called the booke a Pſalter, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . They bee
counted Dauids Pſalmes, becauſe the moſt of them are his,
though there bee beſides, many Pſalmes of other Prophets,
and holy men.
            By this title wee may learne,What to learne from the title. I. That the holy men of God
gaue themſelues to laud God, and to ſet foorth his praiſes.
II. That praiſes and thankſgiuing are a ſpeciall dutie, and
chiefly commended vnto vs, ſith they beare the title of the
booke, before all the reſt of the things therein contained.

III. That theſe Pſalmes are inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, becauſe
they were deliuered vnto the Church by the Prophets
of God, Dauid and the reſt. This is approued by Chriſt, alleaging
a ſaying out of one Pſalme, yet nameth the whole
book, confirming to vs the book of the Pſalmes, Luk. 20. 42.
            Which booke (as many thinke) was collected by Eſdras,
after the Iewes returne from the captiuitie of Babylon: and it
containeth holy ſongs, written by holy men of God vnto the
heauie and lamentable time of that wicked Antiochus.
               The booke diuided into fiue parts two waies. Some
diuide this whole booke into fiue parts thus. The I. from the
firſt Pſalme to the 42. II. from 42. to the 73. III. from 73. to
the 90. IV. from the 90. to the 107. V. from the 107. to the
end. Some other according to the penmen (which the holie
Ghoſt vſed, as they iudge) diuide them thus: I. To Dauid
124. viz. in order from the 1. Pſalme to the 41. then 51. and
ſo to the 72. then 86. and 91. vnto the 150. II. To the ſonnes
of Corah. 12. viz. 42. to 49. then 84. to 88. III. To Aſaph,
12. viz. 50. 73. to 79. then 80. 81. 82. 83. IV. To Ethan the
Eſraite one, Pſalme 89. and V. To Moſes one, Pſal. 90.
            And as the booke conſiſteth of diuers parts, ſo the Pſalmes
are not of one, but of diuers kindes.
            They be either ſimple or mixt:Pſalmes of diuers ſorts. theſe mixt may be referred
to the diuers kinds of the former: which are in number theſe
twelue.

64. 85. 89. 94. 102. 115. 121. 129. 140. By the knowledge
hereof may we haue recourſe vnto ſuch Pſalmes as may beſt
fit vs, at any time according to our preſent ſtate. The number
of the Pſalmes are well knowne to be 150.
         
         
            The firſt Pſalme.
            
               THE ARGVMENT.
               THis Pſalme hath no title: it is not aſcribed to any penman,
but is of the holy Ghoſt, whoſoeuer writ it. Before ſome
Pſalmes is ſhewed who was the penman thereof, and not before
ſome others. By which wee may learne, that as the Scribes of
God are to be eſteemed, and their perſons to be taken notice of,
where their names be mentioned; ſo is the word of truth to bee
entertained, without respect of inquiring after the penman,
where the perſon is not nominated.
            
            This Pſalme is as a preface and introduction to the reſt, and
is Didaſcalical,
               The principall doctrine of this Pſalme. teaching this one maine truth; That a godly
man is the only bleſſed man: whom firſt he deſcribeth, that it
may be knowne who is a godly man; And then he proceedes to
proue him the onely bleſſed man: which he doth, firſt, in respect
of himſelfe, who is made prosperous in all that which he doth:

which happie welfare is illuſtrated from a tree planted by the riuers
of waters, &c. verſ. 3. Secondly, in respect of another ſort
of men, which are the vngodly: for the Pſalmiſt maketh onely
two ſorts of perſons, the one godly, and the other wicked: the
former he auoucheth to be bleſſed, but theſe not ſo, ver. 4. And
therefore is the godly the only bleſſed man. Thirdly, in reſpect
of God, who onely careth for, loueth, and approueth the godly
man: and therefore only he muſt needs be happie.
            
               The vſe of this Pſalme.
               THe vſe of this Pſalme is, I. To hearten, ſtirre vp, confirme,
and ſtrengthen, them that be godly, that they may
perſeuere in a holy and religious courſe vnto the end. II. To
grace and giue honour to the godly, whom here the wicked
in their earthly proſperitie, do account as baſe, vile, and wretched
Caitiffs, and themſelues onely to be the happieſt men.
III. To teach vs to know a godly man from the vngodly, and
the liuely difference betweene them, that ſo wee may adhere
too, and ioy in the fellowſhip of the one, and flie the companie
of the other. IV. To ſhew what is true bleſſednes, wherein
it conſiſteth, and who they be that attaine vnto it. This
fruit and benefit may be reaped from this ſhort Pſalme full
of doctrine, and full of true conſolation.

the ſimilitude of a tree, to which
the bleſſed man is reſembled,
and that in three reſpects:

                                          1. Of plantation.
                                          2. Of fruitfulnes.

                              2. Of the infelicitie
of the wicked, ſet
downe two waies.

                                    1. Priuatiuely, they are not ſo as the godly, neither
for pietie, nor true proſperitie, verſ. 4.
                                    2. Poſitiuely, by
ſhewing what
they bee two
waies:

                                          1. By ſimilitude,
they
be as chaffe,
which noteth
three
things:

                                                1. Their vnprofitablenes.
                                                2. Their lightnes
and vanitie.
                                                3. Their fearefull
end, ſcattered

                                          2. By the conſequent hereof, being
as chaffe, they ſhall not be
able to endure the triall, to
ſtand in iudgement, verſ. 5.
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                        2 A confirmation, ſhewing the cauſe why it ſhall
thus differently befall theſe, and this is

                              1. Gods approouing and taking
care for the godly, verſ. 6.
                              2. His diſallowing and forſaking
the vngodly, verſ. 6.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               The generall obſeruations.
               
                  BLeſſed is, &c. This is gathered and concluded foorth of
all the Pſalme: for the holy Prophet meditating of the
godly, and of the wicked, and rightly iudging of them both,
breaketh foorth at length with this true concluſion, that the
only bleſſed man is the godly man. Bleſſed is the man (ſaith he)
that walketh not, &c. This collection made thus by the man
of God in his holy meditations, is prefixed before the reſt,
and firſt ſet downe,The benefit of the Pſalmes. to ſhew, as by a ſigne hung foorth at the
doore, and entrie into this holie booke. I. What entertainment
the godly ſoule, trauelling in this wilderneſſe of the
world ſhall finde herein, euen comfortable refreſhment in
the knowledge of true happineſſe. II. To allure all that conſider
but the very firſt word, to reade and ſtudie this booke,
which beginneth ſo comfortably. III. To teach vs, that bleſſedneſſe
is an encouragement to godlineſſe. The Prophet
therefore propounds the reward, firſt to our mindes, as the
Crowne to Conquerors: ſo Pſal. 112. 1. and 119. 1. 2. and
128. 1. IV. To ſhew what a ſound concluſion the Pſalmiſt
made vpon his meditation, in comparing the godly and wicked
together in their liues and end. That the godly man is
the bleſſed man. For wee muſt know (as is aforeſaid) that although
this be prefixed; yet it was the concluſion of his meditation.
From which we may learne this, that a minde well informed,
and truly comparing the godly and wicked together:
cannot but with this Prophet, conclude as he doth: as alſo did
Dauid, Pſal. 73. and the godly, Mal. 3. 15. 18. that not the wicked,
be they here neuer ſo glorious, but onely the godly, are
to be accounted happie, whatſoeuer their eſtate be in this
preſent world.
            
            
               
               PSAL. I. VERS. I.
               Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the counſell of the vngodly:Text.
nor ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeate
of the ſcornfull.
               
                  HAppie and thrice happie is that man,Paraphraſe. whoſoeuer
he be, that ſetting the feare of God before his
eyes, doth depart from euill,Prou. 1. 10. 15 and 4. 14. auoiding the fellowſhip
of wicked men:Epheſ. 5. 11. and though ſinners
doe intice him,Pſal. 26. 4. 5. yet doth not conſent,1. Ioh. 5. 18. and 3. 9. much
leſſe doth accuſtome himſelfe to euill, to make a practiſe of
ſinne, or, which is moſt fearfull, to be a1. Cor. 12. 3. ſcorner of goodnes▪
and as one expert and skilfull in wickedneſſe, to make it his
profeſſion, to teach iniquitie alſo vnto others.
               
                  Bleſſed] The word is aſhrei,
                  Explanatiō. and is the plurall number, as if
it were, ſaid, bleſſedneſſes. It is tranſlated adiectiuely, happie,
bleſſed, foelix, beatus, or aduerbially, well, happily, bleſſedly, bene,
foeliciter, beatè. It may be thus expounded: many bleſſings
to that man; or moſt happie is he; or ſucceſfully well: or wel
fareth that man, &c. The conſideration whereof affoordeth
theſe doctrines.
               
                  That God bestoweth not one but many bleſſings vpon the
godly:
                  Doct. 1. Prou. 10. 6. Deut. 28. 2. 6. 1. Tim. 4. 8. Pſal. 68. 19. and
119. 1. 2. 3. and 128. 1. 4. and 112. 1. 2. 3. and 40. 5. Gen. 24. 1.
and 49. 25. Pſal. 21. 3.
               To conſider hereby of Gods liberall hand to the godly,Vſe 1. as
he ſpeakes in Malac. 3. 10. and Prou. 28. 20. to ſtirre vs vp vnto
godlineſſe, as it did Dauid, Pſal. 119. 5.
               Comfort to ſuch as be godly,Vſe 2. for the many bleſſings which
they may expect at the Lords hands: Deut. 28. 1. Tim. 4. 8.
               
                  
                  That many bleſſings are to concurre together,
                  Doct. 2. 
                  to make a man
a bleſſed man. Therefore doth the Pſalmiſt here vſe a word in
the plurall number: Prou. 21. 21. and 2. 9. Rom. 2. 10.
               To know what are thoſe many bleſſings,Vſe. by which wee
may become bleſſed, and to labour for them, crying as Eſau,
but yet with better grace vnto our heauenly father ſo to be
bleſſed of him.
               
                  That man] Ha,
                  Explanatiō. is put emphatically, ha-iſh, that man, which
is a ſingling out of ſome ſpeciall perſon, (yet ſo one, as all of
that ſort is to bee therein comprehended) to whom aſhrei
beatitudines, many bleſſings doe belong, that is, ſuch a man,
as is here meant in this Pſalme, euen the godly and religious
man. Hence we may learne,
               
                  That man,
                  Doct. 1. 
                  as he is a man, is not the bleſſed man: but as he is
ha-iſh, that man, qualified with vertues, and heauenly graces,
as theſe places doe ſhew: Pſal. 2. 12. and 32. 1. 2. and 34. 9.
and 41. 2. and 65. 5. and 84. 6. and 112. 1. and 128. 1. 2.
               Not to iudge our ſelues bleſſed as we be men,Vſe. but as we be
vertuous, and religious; ſuch as the Pſalmiſts in all theſe forenamed
places, doe deſcribe men to bee, whom the Lord accounteth
bleſſed.
               
                  That the godly man,
                  Doct. 2. 
                  which is here vnderſtood in Ha-iſh, is
the happie man. Theſe places conſidered together, proue it:
Luk. 11. 28 Deut. 28. 17. Pſal. 9. 17. and 37. 37. Matth. 25.
34. 41.
               To account therefore the godly bleſſed whatſoeuer their
eſtate be.Vſe 1.
               
               This is to condemne the blindnes of the worldlings,Vſe 2. who
cannot iudge ſo of the godly, to eſteeme them bleſſed, but
ſuch as be like themſelues. Mal. 3. 14. 15.
               
                  Man]

                     ſh,
                  Explanatiō. put for man and woman or for mankinde, Hoſ.
11. 9. it is vſed indefinitly, Exod. 2. 1. 1. King. 20. 20. Leuit.
20. 2. Hoſ. 2. 10. The Septuagint tranſlate it by 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which
is common to man or woman. The doctrine is,
               That euery one that is godly,Doct. without any reſpect of perſon of
what age, ſexe, ſtate, degree, kinred, or nation ſoeuer is bleſſed:
Act. 10. 34. 35. Gal. 2. 28.
               
                  
Comfort to the godly that they are bleſſed,Vſe. be they whatſoeuer
otherwiſe, lew, Gentile, man, woman, bond, free, rich,
poore, &c. For in theſe things before God there is no difference:
Col. 3. 11. 1. Cor. 7. 19. Gal. 3. 28. and 6. 15. 16.
               
                  That,
                  Explanatiō. 
                  &c.] Here the Pſalmiſt begins to deſcribe this Ha-iſh,
the bleſſed man; that we may not miſtake him, but vnderſtand
rightly, his iudgement of a bleſſed man, and whom hee holdeth
ſo to bee, and to this point hee leadeth vs by a true deſcription
of him, as it were by a line, to the liuely view of ſuch
a one: Hereby teaching,
               That a wiſe and prudent teacher (as this Pſalmiſt here) endeuours
to guide aright the iudgement of his hearers,Doct. 1. vnto the true
vnderſtanding of that which he deliuereth; leſt his words of a
bleſſed man be miſtaken, he expoundeth the ſame fully.
               
               Teachers herein ought to follow this holy Prophet,Vſe. making
plaine the doctrine of truth vnto their auditorie, that the
point in hand be not miſ-underſtood: we muſt be as Nathan
to Dauid, 2. Sam. 12. 1. 7. and as the Prophet vnto Achab:
1. King. 20. 39. 42.
               
                  That by a true deſcription of a bleſſed man,
                  Doct. 2. 
                  our iudgements
may bee rightly informed, to know who is indeed bleſſed, who are
not. The Pſalmiſt here, and euery where, by deſcription ſetteth
out to vs this bleſſed man, ſo to know him: Pſal. 112. 1.
and 128. 1. 2. and 119. 1. 2. 3.
               To know a bleſſed man,Vſe. finde out the deſcription of him,
as he is in the holy Scriptures laid open before vs, hereby ſhal
we iudge rightly of our ſelues and of others, and not erroniouſly
account thoſe bleſſed, that bee rather accurſed, nor
thoſe curſed, which are indeed truly bleſſed.
               In deſcribing the bleſſed man,Explanation. the Prophet doth ſet out his
godlineſſe: but yet doth not reſt in generall tearmes, he laieth
him open in the ſeuerall parts thereof, particularizing his pietie,
and religious practiſes. By this, teaching
               
                  That a bleſſedman in the Lords ſight,
                  Doct. 1. 
                  is to be found by his godlineſſe.
For before is proued, that the godly man is the bleſſed
man.
               This confuteth their error,Vſe. and condemneth their practiſe,

who ſeeke in, and by worldly honour, pleaſure, profit, naturall
gifts, arts, knowledge of tongues, or in and by, the compounded
habit of morall vertues, to become bleſſed, and not by
true godlineſſe.
               That godlineſſe doth not ſtand of generalities,Doct. 2. but of certaine
diſtinct parts, in which he that is godly doth exerciſe himſelfe: as
here the Pſalmiſt plainly teacheth, and ſo in Iob. 1. 1. 8. and
2. 3. ſo Act. 10. 2. and Luk. 1. 6. Gen. 6. 9.
               To be held godly,Vſe. ſhew foorth the parts of godlineſſe, the
generall in ſpecials, the whole in parts, as the godly be in holy
writ commended, according to the forenamed Scriptures.
               
                  Therefore hereupon may be concluded:
                  Doct. 3. That where at leaſt
the maine and principall parts of godlineſſe are not practiſed, there
is not true godlineſſe it ſelfe.
               Conſutation of ſuch,Vſe. as vainly doe conceit themſelues to
be godly: and yet examine the parts, and there ſhall be found
none.
               
                  Bleſſed is that man] Theſe words,Explanatiō. as they are to be conſidered
with the third verſe and ſixth, ſetting out the reward of
this godlineſſe, ſo alſo to be conioyned with the words immediatly
following in this 1. and 2. verſes thus: That man is
bleſſed that hath not walked, &c. To teach vs,
               That a man is bleſſed aſwell in his graces,Doct. and practiſe of godlineſſe;
as in the benefits and comforts, wherewith the Lord rewards
him in mercie for the ſame. For elſe why are men ſaid to
be bleſſed, becauſe they be godly? Luk. 11. 28. Pſal. 119. 1. 2.
Matth. 13. 16. Pſal. 34. 8. and 40. 4. and 106. 3.
               To hold our godlineſſe,Vſe 1. to be the firſt and principall part of
our bleſſednes here, and that other things are onely the rewards
thereof for greater incouragements to well doing.
Deut. 28. 1. Tim. 4. 8.
               A reproofe to ſuch,Vſe 2. as onely thinke themſelues then bleſſed,
when they with profeſſion of religion, enioy peace, and
outward proſperitie; when they alſo are bleſſed, who ſuffer
for their profeſſion: Matth. 5. 10. 11. 1 Pet. 4. 14.
               
                  Walketh not] In the deſcription of a bleſſed mans godlines,Explanatiō
                  
the Pſalmiſt ſhewes, both what hee doth not, and what hee

doth: but in the firſt place, what he doth not. By this may we
learne,
               That the practiſe of pietie ſtands of two parts:Doct. 
                  viz. the leauing
of that which is euill, and the doing of that which is good. This are
we taught, in Iſai. 1. 16. 17. Pſal. 34. 14. and 37. 27. Epheſ. 4.
22. 23. 1. Pet. 2. 1. Act. 26. 18.

               A confutation of ſuch as verily thinke themſelues religious
if they leaue euill,Vſe 2. (if ſo they could indeed) though they
doe no good. But conſider theſe places: Mat. 3: 10. Luk. 13. 7.

reformed: of ſuch ſpeaketh Eſay in chap. 58. and Salomon in
Prou. 30. 11. but marke the exhortation in 2. Tim. 2. 19.
               
                  That the firſt part of religion is the leaning of euill.
                  Doct. 2. Tit. 2. 11. 12.
Luk. 1. 74. 75. Pſal. 119. 32. Let vs therfore leaue wickednes,
before we goe on to practiſe goodneſſe: elſe our labour will
be in vaine, our ſeruice not acceptable to God: Eſai. 1. 11. 12.
13. 14. 15. Prou. 3. 7. 8.
               
                  Walketh not.
                  Explanation. Or, doth not walke. Here in this word is an act,
noting an outward and viſible conuerſation: ſo in the word
not ſtand, not ſit: to note vnto vs,
               That a godly bleſſed man,Doct. doth not only in iudgement diſallow,
and in affection hate euill, but doth outwardly in his practiſe auoyd
the ſame: Prou. 14. 16. Pſal. 119. 101.
               Therefore let vs not onely inwardly condemne and diſlike
of euill,Vſe. but alſo outwardly eſchue it and depart therefrom:
Prou. 2. 7. as wee may ſee the godly doe: Prou. 16. 17. and
14. 16. Pſal. 119. 101.
               Walketh not in the counſell of the vngodly,Text. nor ſtand in the
way of ſinners, nor ſit in the ſeate of the ſcornfull.
               The Pſalmiſt in this firſt part of the deſcription of a godly
mans conuerſation,Explanation. maketh a threefold gradation, in a triple
reſpect; to which, as to generall heads, may be reduced al the
ſorts of the wicked, all kindes of ſinne, and euery manner of

ſinning, with the progreſſe therein. From this gradation may
we learne:
               That there be degrees of wicked men,Doct. 1. all not alike wicked, either
for matter or manner, noted in theſe words, vngodly, ſinners,
ſcornfull: Gal. 6. 1. Eſai. 31. 6. Ezek. 16. 46. 47. 51.
               Not to iudge of all alike,Vſe. but to learne to diſcerne of the
wicked one from another: for ſome ſinne of infirmitie, other
malitiouſly, as Scribes and Phariſees againſt Chriſt; ſome of
ignorance, is ſome Iewes, Acts 3. others of enuie, and premeditating
thereof, and therefore are not to be dealt alike with:
Iude verſ. 22. 23.
               That there are degrees of ſinne,Doct. 2. 
                  noted in theſe words, counſell,
way, ſeate, 1. Ioh. 5. 16. 17. Pſal. 19. 12. 13. Ezek. 23. 43.
               To know that there may be a progreſſe in wickedneſſe,Vſe. to
take heed of the beginnings thereof, that we come not to the
height.
               
                  That there be degrees in the manner of ſinning,
                  Doct. 3. expreſſed in
theſe words, walketh, ſtandeth, ſitteth, the former Scripture in
the two other doctrines, doe ſhew this, being compared together.
               To conſider in our falles how we haue offended:Vſe. for thereafter
are we to bee humbled: and from hence alſo may there
ariſe ſome hope of mercie to comfort the afflicted ſoule of
the penitent, when with S. Paul they know they ſinned of ignorance
through vnbeleefe, and not maliciouſly.
               The bleſſed man here is ſaid to auoid all theſe:Explanation. he walkes
not, nor ſtands, nor ſits with theſe wicked ones: to teach vs,
               That a godly bleſſed man eſchueth all ſorts of wicked perſons,Doct.
all kinds of ſinne, and manner of ſinning: Pſal. 26. 5. and 31. 6.
and 119. 115. Ierem. 15. 17. Pſal. 101. 3. and 45. 7. 8. and
119. 101.
               To endeuour to flie from (if thou wouldeſt be held godly)
all the ſorts of wicked men:Vſe 1. Prou. 4. 14. and 1. 15. Pſal. 119.
115. and from all kinds of ſinne, hating all falſe waies: Pſal.
119. 104. 128. and to feare to ſinne in what manner ſoeuer.
It is a part of a godly mans bleſſednes.
               A reproofe to ſuch,Vſe 2. as make no conſcience to conuerſe

with the wicked, as Pſalm. 106. 35. for pleaſure, for profit
and aduancement to marry with them, to liue in ſome pleaſurable,
or ſome gainefull ſinne; to ſinne in ſecret, though
not openly, &c. contrary to Pſal. 55. 1. Reuel. 18. 4. 2. Cor.
6 14. Exod. 23. 32. Pſalm. 119. 115.
               
                  Walketh not in the counſell of the vngodly.
                  Explanation] Theſe words
are the firſt in the negatiue part, and the loweſt in the gradation,
touching the euil men, their ſinne, and manner of ſinning;
yet are ſuch tearmed wicked and vngodly, ſhewing
               That euen the loweſt ranke of ſuch as bee not godly,Doct. may bee
accounted wicked, or vngodly, till they amend. Ezek. 33. 8. 9. &
18. 21. 27.
               To be contented to carry this title,Vſe. till thou beeſt repentant.
For God hath ſet it vpon thee by his Prophet, and here
the loweſt degree of euill men are ſo called.
               The word (raſhang,)

vngodly, by the ſeptuagint, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . It ſignifieth, one vnſtable,
restleſſe, and vngratious: teaching,
               That men vnreformed,Doct. naturally through this corruption
are reſtleſſe, without peace in themſelues, diſturbers of others,
and as the raging ſeas. Pro. 4. 16. Eſa. 57. 20. 21.
               To take knowledge of this our vnpeaceable nature,Vſe. and
to bewaile the ſame. For heereby are we raſhang, euen condemned

                  That the wicked and vngodly haue their counſell,
                  Doct. 2. Sam. 16.

               The word gnatſah,
                  Explanation ſignifieth the counſell decreed by deliberation,

as the counſell of Achitophell. 2. Sam. 16. 23. where
the word is vſed, teaching
               That euill men are wiſe to doe euill,Doct. and can aduiſedly proceed.
Ier. 4. 22. ſee more, Pſal. 2. 2.
               Therefore to pray with Dauid againſt their wiſedome and
crafty pollicie,Vſe. that God would confound it, as in the 2. Sam.
15. 31. for he can ouerthrow their deuiſes, Nehem. 4. 15. Pſal.
33. 10. Ioh. 5. 12. Eſa. 41. 11.—16.
               
                  Walketh.
                  Explanatiō.] ſo ſtand and ſit, is heere put indefinitely, for time
paſt, preſent, and to come, and doe note a continued action,
for that here is a generall doctrine, and not an hiſtoricall narration.
And to walke in the counſell of any, is either to doe
as they aduiſe, 2. Chron. 22. 3. 4. 5. or to imitate them,
Mich. 6. 16. heere it is ſaid that the bleſſed man walketh not
in the counſell of the vngodly. Hence we learne,
               That a godly man is not to goe to take wicked mens aduiſe,Doct.
neither is he to be a follower of them, his conuerſation is not framed
after their counſell. Iob. 21. 16. and 22. 18.
               Reproofe to thoſe that doe faſhion themſelues,Vſe. to the
wills and pleaſures of wicked men, like thoſe mentioned in
2. Chron. 22. 3. 4. 5. and yet would be iudged godly and religious,
but conſider, Romanes. 12. 2. Pſalm. 15. 4. Iam.
1. 27.
               To walke properly,Explanatiō. ſpeaking of the body, is to ſet footing
and to goe forward, figuratiuely, it is put for conuerſation of
life, touching faith and workes. Pſalm. 118. 1. and 119. 1.
Gen. 5. 24. compared with Hebr. 11. 5. 6. 2. Pet. 2. 10.
Iude verſ. 11. A godly man thus walkes not in the counſell
of the wicked: teaching heereby,
               That albeit a godly man may ſlip aſide,Doct. 1. Kings 8. 46. Iob.
15. 14. and bee ſuddenly mooued by the counſell of the vngodly,
yet he ſets not footing ſtill to goe forward, to make it his whole
courſe to liue and continue therein: as the falls and riſing againe
of all the godly do proue, and Romanes. 7. 19. Galat.
5. 17.
               To conſider of the falls of the godly,
                     Ʋſe 1. and the vngodly, and
to make a difference betweene them.
               
                  
To tell vs that though we do fall,Vſe. 2. and ſlp aſide, yet may we
not continue in euill, for that the godly doe not, but walke
with God. Gen. 5. 22. and 6. 9. and 17. 1. 1. King. 3. 6. Eſa.
38. 3. It is an Elimas the child of the Deuill, and one full of
miſchiefe, that will not ceaſe to peruert the right waies of the
Lord. Acts. 13. 10.
               
                  Nor ſtand in the way of ſinners.
                  Explanatiō.] This is the next gradation
touching the ranke of euill ones in the degree of ſinne, and
manner in ſinning, and the ſecond branch of the negatiue
part: by this we may learne,
               That he that becommeth a ſinner,Doct. and ſtandeth in their way,
is entred farther into the kingdome of the Deuill, than thoſe
that walke in the counſell of the wicked.
               To ſearch into our eſtate,Vſe. and to conſider into what a degree
of ſinne wee are fallen: to worke in vs the greater humiliation,
feare, and repentance.
               
                  Sinners.
                  Explanatiō.] Theſe are in an higher degree of euill than the
reſt called vngodly, or wicked: Hence obſerue,
               That there are not onely ſuch as be wicked,Doct. (as are all by nature)
but which may alſo be called, and accounted ſinners. Gen.
13. 13. 1. Sam. 15. 18. 1. Tim. 1. 9. Mat. 26. 45. For men
may be diſtinguiſhed by names, as they ranke themſelues in
ſinne.
               
               To be contented to bee called as thy courſe doth deſerue:Vſe.
as men will bee deeper in ſinne, let them looke for a greater
diſgrace, and titles anſwerable thereunto. Eſay. 1. 10. Amos
4. 1. Zeph. 3. 3. Acts. 13. 10. Ierem. 9. 2.
               The word Chataim,
                  Explanatiō. comming of Chata, to erre out of the
way, here tranſlated ſinners, is meant enormious perſons, viciouſly
giuen, ſo as they are reputed vile, as the word is taken
1. King. 1. 21. and to ſuch is this name giuen, Pſalm. 26. 9.
and 104. 35. Mat. 9. 10. 13. and 11. 12. and 26. 45. Luke
5. 30. and 7. 37. and 19. 7. Iohn 9. 16. 31. by this may we
learne,
               That theſe are to be counted ſinners,Doct. who erre from the way
of well-doing, & ſo giue themſelues to euill, as they become vile,
the places in the explanation proue this.
               
               
                  
To diſcerne a difference betweene hauing of ſin,Vſe. 1. Ioh. 1.
and to bee a ſinner: all haue ſinne, but all are not accounted
ſinners, oppoſed to them that are good, Eccl. 9. 2. in this reſpect,
they that are born of God, are ſaid not to ſin. 1. Ioh. 3. 9.
They liue not in a trade or way of ſinning; they perhaps may
ſtep at vnawares, but not walke: ſtray, but not ſtand; ſtumble
vnwillingly, but not ſit downe wilfully in wickedneſſe; of
weakeneſſe they may turne aſide a little, but they are not
workers of iniquity, but walke in the Lords waies. Pſalme

                  The way of ſinners.
                  Explanation] As counſell was giuen to the wicked,
ſo heere way to the ſinners, to ſhew.
               That as wicked haue their counſell,Doct. ſo ſinners haue their way:
of which read, Prouerbs 2. 12. 13. 15. and 12. 15. and this

27. Ier. 2. 23. and 3. 21. and 10. 2. 3. and 26. 3.
               The word derech,
                  Explanation way, properly is a common troden path,
or trackt. Gen. 49. 17. it is alſo vſed figuratiuely, for an vſuall
cuſtome, Gen. 31. 34. ſo for a common courſe of liuing,
whereunto any are accuſtomed, and daily doe tread in, teaching,
               That the way of ſinners is a common road,Doct. 1. and a beaten tract
of ſinning; or the cuſtome of ſin is their ordinary courſe.
               To ſeperate from their fellowſhip,Vſe. for they cannot but doe
wickedly. Prou. 4. 16.

                  Explanation] The worde gnamad, properly ſignifieth to ſtand
vnmoueable. Pſal. 33. 11. as one that hath pitched his tent,
to dwell there; figuratiuely it is put for the ſetledneſſe of the
affection, and the hearts reſolution, Pſal. 122 2. according

                  is not of a ſetled affection, reſolued to
pitch his standing in a cuſtome of ſinning with wicked ſinners:
he may ſlide, and fall, but reſolueth not to ſinne. For a Dauid
is purpoſely reſolued to keepe Gods Law, and applieth
his heart thereunto. Pſal. 119. 112.
               Stand not in the way of ſinners,Vſe. if thou wouldeſt be held
godly; for though the prodigall ſonne fall, yet he ſettles not
himſelfe in wickednes, but comming to himſelfe, he reſolues
to change his courſe. Luke 15. 18. Yea when Dauid doth
conſider his waies, he will turne his feete vnto the Lords ſtatutes.

                  Explanation] The third degree of euill
ones, ſinne and manner of ſinning, and the laſt branch of
the negatiue part, by this we may learne.

               Looke to finde ſuch as will bee deriders and mockers at

                  That theſe ſcorners are the worſt ſort of euill perſons:
                  Doct. 2. A man
is wicked by nature; a ſinner, by cuſtome and often practiſe
of ſinne: but a ſcorner is ſo, through hardnes of heart, and
contempt of religion, Septuagint tranſlate it by, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   a peſtilent

               The word letſim,

arrogant cauillers at words and deedes, craftie, cunning to do
euill, hating rebuke, malicious, deriding holie exerciſes in
words, geſture, countenance, &c. Hereby may wee bee informed
to know ſcorners.
               That they be ſuch,Doct. as out of pride, hate rebukes, cauill at words
and deeds, mocking at godlineſſe, contemning reformation, taking
libertie to ſinne, making light of Gods iudgements, and doe ſecurely
bleſſe themſelves. Places compared and examples ſhew this

                  The ſeate of ſcorners.
                  Explanatiō.] As before counſell was aſcribed to
the wicked, and way to ſinners: ſo a feate to ſcorners. Seate,
is properly taken for a place to fit in: 1. Sam. 20. 25 Iob. 29. 7.
figuratiuely for authoritie, Matth. 23. 2. This ſheweth,
               
                  That the courſe of ſcorners is vnalterable,
                  Doct. 1, 
                  and their perſons
incorrigible: Prou. 13. 1. and 9. 8. for they take authoritie to
ſinne, as controllers, not be controlled.
               Not to rebuke them,Vſe. leſt they hate thee, they will not heare
thy rebukes, as the places ſhew: for they take pleaſure in ſcorning,
Pro. 1. 22. they are as the blackmoore, Iere. 13. 23. and
as Ahab that ſold himſelfe to commit wickedneſſe, 1. King.
21. 25.
               That theſe wicked wretches,Doct. 2. yet quicke witted, often get the

ſeate of authoritie with euill Princes: Oſe. 7. 5. ſee it in Zedkiah,
Paſhar, and Amaziah.
               To bewaile this corruption in the world,Vſe. in which, curſed
ſcorners hated of God, yet get the ſeate among men.
               That the ſcorners ſinning,Doct. 3. is made here the higheſt degree of
ſinning in this gradation. Counſell, is the error, and miſleading
of the minde: way, the defilement of life; but ſeate, and therein
ſitting, the heigth of both. One ſaith: Ambulare, eſt humana
fragilitatis; ſtare, peruerſae voluntatis; but in cathedra ſedere,
cordis obdurati malignitatis.
               Scornefull men,Vſe. learne hereby the nature of your ſinning:
if your will be the deepeſt in tranſgreſſion, your plagues ſhal
be anſwerable in the day of iudgement, when God will reward
euery one according to his doings: Rom. 2. 6. 2. Cor. 5.
10. Pro. 24. 12.
               
                  Nor ſitteth] This is ſpoken of the godly bleſſed man,Explanatiō. that
he ſitteth not in the ſeate of the ſcornefull. To ſit, is to abide,
continue, and dwell: Pſal. 2. 4. and 101. 6. 7. and 132. 14. or
to companie with, Pſal. 26. 4. 5. Seate, is further taken, for an
habitation and dwelling, Pſal. 107. 4. 7. and 132. 13. or for
an aſſembly, Pſal. 107. 32. Hence we learne,
               That a godly man continueth not with ſuch wicked and euill
men;Doct. he doth not familiarly company with them, neither ioyneth
himſelfe to their meetings: Pſal. 26. 4. 5. and 31. 6. and 119.
115. Iere. 15. 17.
               This condemneth them,Vſe. which for feare, fauour, hope of
gaine, or otherwiſe, can bee content to be companions with
ſuch, doe frequent their meetings, and make one with them.
But it is a part of godlines, and of the godly mans bleſſednes
(here noted) not to ſit in their ſeate.
            
            
               VERSE. II.
               But his delight is in the law of the Lord.Text. And in his law doth
he meditate day and night.
               THat is,Paraphraſe. he doth indeed quite contrarie, to wit, not onely
auoiding euill, with all the ſteps and degrees thereof,

with all occaſions thereunto, but daily exerciſeth himſelfe in
Pſal. 101. 2. and 145. 2. Luke 2. 37. Acts 2. 46, and 10. 2. good things. And howſoeuer the wicked make a ſport, and
a game of ſinne,Prou. 10. 23. and cannot bee merrie except they haue
done ſome euill: yet this bleſſed man, can ſolace himſelfe in
nothing but the holy Scriptures, the law of his God: And
theſe indeed doe yeeld him ſuch truePſal. 119. 14. 16. 24. 72 and 112. 1. Ier. 5. 16. delight, that they are

he doth, and both conioyned to one perſon, teaching
               That a godly man, reſteth not onely in leauing of wickedneſſe:
but he ſetteth himſelfe forward, to the practiſe of goodnes: Iob. 1.
1. 8. and 2. 3. Dauid carefully auoided ſinne, Pſal. 119. 11.
133. but it was to keepe Gods word, Pſalm. 119. 101. The

               As we doe leaue euill,Vſe 1. ſo let vs endeuour to doe well: it is

Rom. 12. 9. Of this further, ſee before, verſ. 1. towards the beginning.
               Reproofe to ſuch as iudge themſelues good Chriſtians by
not doing euill,Vſe 2. when yet they doe not that which is good:
but let ſuch conſider theſe places: Iudg. 5. 23. Matth. 3. 10.
and 25. 41.
               
                  But] This is a note of diuerſitie,Explanatiō. putting a difference of that
which is before, and that which followeth: by this to note
to vs,
               That a bleſſed mans courſe,Doct. which he taketh in hand, is differing
from euery courſe of all ſorts of the euill ones, whoſe waies hee
eſcheweth: See this in Iacob from Eſau, Dauid from Saul, Michaah
from Zedkiah, Ieremiah from Paſhur, Ioſeph of Arimathea
from the other Elders, &c.
               
               Let thy differing courſe which thou doeſt practiſe,Vſe. make
thee to be diſcerned from the courſes of the wicked, if thou
wouldeſt be held, one leauing their waies: for it is not thy
bodily leauing of their companie, that ſeuereth thee from
thē: but thy contrary practiſes, in holines and righteouſnes.
               
                  
                  His delight] Here the godly and bleſſed mans delight,Explanation. is
oppoſed to all that went before. As if he ſhould ſay, he walks
not in the counſell of the vngodly, nor ſtands in the way of
ſinners, nor ſits in the ſeate of the ſcornefull; becauſe his delight
is vpon another thing that is better. Doctrine,
               
                  That the ſoules contrary delight in men,
                  Doct. 
                  cauſeth one mans
courſe, to be contrarie to another mans. This is true generallie:
ſo much more betweene the godly and wicked, whoſe delights
ſo gready differ, as here may bee noted, alſo in other
places of the Pſalmes and Prouerbes, in which their differing
delights and courſes are fully ſet downe.
               That wee may differ in our courſes,Vſe. let vs ſet our loue and
delight on good things, differing from the delights of the
wicked: for as our hearts are ſet, ſo will we meditate and practiſe.
Dauids delight was in Gods law, Pſal. 119. 14. 20. 24.
73. therefore he meditated in them, Pſal. 119. 15. and refrained
his feete from euery euill way: verſ. 101. 128.
               The word Chephets of Chaphets,
                  Explanation. ſignifieth to embrace with
loue; with good will, with a pleaſurable loue, and an affectionate
will and deſire vnto a thing: Eſai. 62. 4. Gen. 34. 19. It
is a louing delight, or delightfull loue, and therefore are both
read together, Pſal. 119. 47. Hence obſerue,
               
                  That a godly man hath his true delight and pleaſure:
                  Doct. Pro. 29.
6. Dauid ſpeakes of great delight, Pſal. 119. 14. He daunced
before the Arke, 2. Sam. 6. 14. The wiſe men reioyced exceedingly,
Matth. 2. 10. So others, Act. 5 41. and 8. 39.
               Therefore let vs not thinke the ſtate of the godly to bee
comfortleſſe and miſerable,Vſe. as the wicked imagine: for that
they cannot know nor feele the godly mans ioy; becauſe the
godly delight in the Lord, Phil. 4. 4. Pſal. 64. 10. and in goodneſſe,
2. Chron. 6. 41. but not in the carnall pleaſures of the
world, as the wicked doe, Prou. 10. 23. and 14. 9. and 2. 14.
which maketh theſe to ſpeake euill of them, 1 Pet. 2. 12. and
to wonder at them. 1. Pet. 4. 4.
               
                  Is in the law of the Lord.]
                  Explanation. Here is noted wherein a godly
man is delighted, not in vanitie, wickedneſſe, fooliſh bookes;
not onely in the lawes of man, nor in the things of this life,

wherein the wicked take delight: but in the law of the Lord,
that is in Gods word, for it is put for the whole word of God,
Pſal. 19. 7. Ioh. 10. 34. Iam. 1. 15. that is, the holy Scriptures,
which is to vs the word of God, and aboue which we may
not preſume, 1. Cor. 4. 6. This heere is oppoſed againſt the
counſell, way, and ſeate of euill men. From hence wee may
learne many things.
               Firſt,Doct. 1. that a godly bleſſed man, is delighted in the holy Scriptures:
he hath a loue and deſire to them: Pſal. 119. 16. 24. 35.
47. 77. Iob. 23. 12. Pſal. 16. 10. Deut. 33. 3.
               To delight in the law of God;Vſe 1. it is a part of a godly mans
bleſſedneſſe, and his propertie. Now what kinde of delight,
and how great our ioy and loue ſhould bee thereunto, reade
Pſal. 119. 14. 54. 72. 97. 111. 117. See the motiues hereunto
in the ſame Pſalme. verſ. 92. 104. 105. Pro. 2. 10. 16. and
8. 10. 11. and Rom. 1. 16. and 10. 14. Mat. 13. 44. Deut. 32.
47. Ioſu. 1. 7. 8. Iere. 6. 10. 11.
               Reproofe to ſuch,Vſe 2. as take no delight in the holy word of
God. Iere. 6. 10. but let ſuch conſider, Pſal. 119. 150. 155.
Ioh. 10. 27. and 8. 47.
               Secondly,Doct. 2. that therefore the word of God affoordeth pleaſure
and delight to the godly man: Pſal. 119. 103. and 19. 10. Ezek.
3. 3. Reuel. 10. 9. 10.
               To labour to finde this ſweet and pleaſurable taſte of Gods
word:Vſe. for the ſaying of Salomon may bee moſt truly verified
vpon Gods word, Pro. 16. 24. If we cannot perceiue this excellencie
of the word, it is becauſe we are yet naturall. 1. Corinth.
2. 14.
               Thirdly,Doct. 3. that a godly mans piety and religion is not forced nor
counterfeit, for the word is ioy & delight vnto him. The word
Chephets is voluptas & prompta voluntas, Pſal. 111. 2. The Septuagint
tranſlate the words thus, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
               This ſerues to condemne all thoſe for hypocrites,Vſe. timeſeruers,
and carnall people, who entertaine religion of a cuſtome,
of feare, for companie; but not as the godly man, of a
ready good will,Doct. 4. out of a true delight therein.
               That a godly man preferreth this word of God before the counſell

of the vngodly, the way of ſinners and ſeate of the ſcornfull,
all which he eſcheweth for his delight heerin, Pſalm. 119. 115
and by the power thereof is deliuered from them. Prouerbs
2. 11.—16.
               To preferre the holy worde of the Lord before all mens
deuiſes,Vſe. counſells, wayes, and authorities: the godly man
doth ſo, and the worde will worke this in thee, if euer thou
doſt feele the liuely efficacy thereof.
               
                  And in that law.
                  Explanatiō.] By Law as is aforeſaid, is to be vnderſtood
the whole Scriptures. viz. Geneſis. Gal. 4. 21. 22. Prophets.
1. Cor. 14. 12. Pſalmes. Ioh. 15. 25. it is put for doctrine
generally, Pſal. 78. 1. as the law of workes and law of
faith, Rom. 3. 27. Hence learne,
               That the holy Ghoſt deliuers the Scriptures in wordes ſometime,Doct.
which may haue diuers acceptions: inſtances are euery
where to be found.
               
               To conſider of the words of the holy writ,Vſe. and not to take
them raſhly, but know firſt the variety of ſignifications, and
the circumſtances of the place, thereby to take thence the
right meaning of the words.
               In that the Scriptures of God are called a Law,
                  Explanatiō. it may
teach vs,
               That the word of God hath a commanding power,Doct. force, and
authority, to gouerne and moderate, requiring obedience, as a
law of euery one of the Lords people and ſubiects.
               To entertaine the word,Vſe. and ſtudy the Scriptures, as a law,
for thy guide and gouernance, and to become therunto obedient:
otherwiſe to read them, is not to make a right vſe, or
to aime at the true end, for which the word was written: read
Deut. 4. 10. 13. 14. and 30. 12. Pſalm. 119. 33. 34.
               The word Thorah,
                  Explanatiō. Law or doctrine, commeth of jarah, to
caſt forth or to dart, and it implieth an orderly diſpoſing of
the doctrine. For in 2. Sam. 7. 19. the word is Lawe, and in
the 1. Chron. 17. 17. is diſpoſition. Hence note,
               That Gods word is an orderly manner of inſtructing,Doct. & withall
ſharpe and piercing. Eccleſ. 10. 11. Heb. 4. 12. Act. 2. 37.
               Not to thinke the word to bee immethodicall,Vſe. and therefore

to handle it too rudely: but to vſe it warily and wiſely,
as a ſharp too edged ſword, piercing into the ſoule. Hebrews
4. 12.
               
                  Doth he meditate.
                  Explanation] The word ichgeh of hagah meditate,
is put indefinitely, hath, doth, and will meditate, vſually; the
word importeth ſtudy and exerciſe of the mind, which often
burſteth out into voyce: it is vſed for muſing in the minde
and heart, Prou. 24. 2. Eſa. 33. 18. alſo for muttering with
the mouth which the heart mindeth. Pſal. 2. 1. and 37. 30.
Prou. 8. 7. Eſa. 59. 3. with a low and imperfect voyce, Eſa. 8.
19. Learne,
               That the godly which delight in the law,Doct. do meditate, ſtudie,
and exerciſe their minds in it, as Dauid did, Pſal. 119. 15. 23.
97. 99. and 63. 6. yea, they will talke and ſpeake of it. Pſ. 37.
30. 31. Luke 24. 15.
               To ſhew our delight in Gods word,Vſe 1. let vs haue our minds
vpon it, and ſpeake thereof, Deut. 11. 19. 20. and 6. 7. Pſal.
49. 3.
               A reproofe vnto ſuch as minde little Gods word:Vſe 2. but delight
in ſome other manner of learning, perhaps, and can
ſpeake thereof, but out of Gods worde little or nothing.
               This condemneth the folly and madneſſe of Papiſts,Vſe. 3. who
will be held godly, and yet either very little, or not at all, ſtudy
the holy Scriptures. If theſe become godly they are ſuch,
as heere the Pſalmiſt neuer dreamed of.
               
                  Day and night.
                  Explanation] By this ſaying hee meaneth continually,
and heere note, that the word day, is not jom, but jomam, the
laſt better, being added, to note a continuance of daies, by
which ſpeech wee haue commended vnto vs a godly mans
meditation.
               That it is,Doct. firſt, frequent & often, Pſal. 119. 16. 164. being
on the day time, and on the night. Secondly, vigilant, he
muſeth on the word, when others ſleepe. Pſal. 42. 8. and 77.
6. and 92. 2. and 119. 15. 62. Thirdly, feruent, Pſal. 119.
117. Pſal. 39. 3. becauſe in the day time no worldly occaſions
can withdraw his minde, neither nights ſleepe cauſe him
to forget it. Pſal. 119. 148. Fourthly, Conſtant, becauſe it

is not ſaide, a day and a night, but day and night. Pſalme
119. 97.
               To be frequent,
                     Ʋſe 1. vigilant, feruent and conſtant in our meditation
on Gods word. Ioſ. 1. 8. Pſalm. 77. 6. Deutero.
6. 6. 7. 8.
               This reproueth;Vſe. 2. Firſt, the hypocrite, whoſe meditation is
but perfunctory, and without conſtancy; in aduerſity, but
not in proſperity, &c. Secondly, the prophane, who meditate
deceit, Pſal. 38. 12. miſchiefe, Pſal. 36. 4. deſtruction, Pro.
24. 2. vaine things and wicked, Pſalm. 2. 1. Acts 4. 25.
            
            
               VERSE III.
               For hee ſhall be like a tree,Text. planted by the riuers of waters,
that bringeth forth his fruit in due ſeaſon, whoſe leafe ſhall not
fade, and whatſoeuer he doth ſhall proſper.
               AS if he had ſaid,Paraphraſe. how can it therefore otherwiſe bee, but
that ſuch a one ſhould bee moſt fruitfull in allPſal. 112. 5. Acts 9. 35. 10 2 good
workes, and alſoPſal. 112. 2. 3. proſperous in all his waies? who cannot

For as ſuch a tree being well husbanded, and planted by the
riuers of water, in a fruitfull ſoyle,Ier. 17. 8. (where it needs not feare
the yeare of drought, nor the heat when it commeth) doth

his grace, and thusPſal. 92. 13. planted by his diuine power, (the worke
of his ſpirit) in his Eden, the true Church, and engraffed into
his ſonne Ieſus, by theIoh. 7. 39. fountaine of liuing waters, the ſacred
Scriptures, & effectuall graces of his ſanctifying ſpirit, which
he giueth to euery one that beleeueth, cannot but bePhil. 1. 11. Pſal. 92. 13. 14. filled
with the fruits of righteouſneſſe, which hee yeeldeth opportunely,
and in very due time; and that not onely once, or for
a while, butPſal. 119. 33. 111. 112. perſeuering in well-doing, hee doth continue

vnto the end, without fading through aduerſity, or changing
by perſecution; God turning all things to the beſt, and proſpering
him in all that he puts his hand vnto.
               The Pſalmiſt ſetteth out a godly mans bleſſedneſſe,Explanation as alſo
the fruitfulneſſe of his delight, and meditation in Gods law,
and this he doth by a ſimilitude, from a tree planted in a fruitfull
place, and anſwerablie, in due ſeaſon bringing foorth
fruit, heereby giuing vs to vnderſtand,
               
                  That a godly mans bleſſed eſtate is not eaſily perceiued,
                  Doct. 
                  or not
ſo deepely conſidered of, as is worthy. Therefore is it here painted
out to the view of all, by this liuely ſimilitude. That the
godly are not eſteemed after their worth, appeareth, 1. Cor.
4. 13. where they be called, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
filthes, and the off-ſcowring of all things.
               To take a more ſerious and conſiderate view of the godly
mans bleſſedneſſe (which the world indeede cannot truely
take notice of) and marke how the Lord ſetteth him out,Vſe.
by godly compariſons in many places, which are conſiderately
to bee beholden, as the pictures which God maketh,
painting out the godly man.
               
                  And he ſhall be like.
                  Explanation] The Pſalmiſt might haue ſet out
the bleſſed mans condition without a ſimilitude, but the
Lord hereby would ſhew vs,
               That the minds of the godly can obſerue out of the workes of
God,Doct. 1. that which may put them in mind of heauenly things, Pſal.
123. 2. and 125. 1. 2. and 128. 3. Eccleſ. 12, 2—7.
               Heereby let vs learne ſo to looke vpon,Vſe. and to conſider
of earthly things here, as thereby we may aſcend vp to heauenly.
Thus are the godly taught of God to doe, but an vnwiſe
man knoweth not this, Pſal. 92. 6.
               That it is lawfull to make reſemblances,Doct. 2. and likeneſſes betweene
corporall and ſpirituall, earthly and heauenly things, for
our better inſtruction. Eſa. 5. Pſalm. 92. 12. Mat. 13. 3. 24.

               To vſe our liberty thus in teaching,Vſe. wiſely, and ſoberly,
for the edification of the hearers. Chriſt Ieſus the chiefe

ſhepheard, the Prophets, and Apoſtles, haue vſed to teach
by ſimilitudes.
               
                  A tree.
                  Explanation] The word gnets ſignifieth lignum aridum, Pſalm.
74. 5. and is tranſlated by 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which we call wood, a boule,
a logge, but is alſo vſed for a greene tree. Gen. 2. and 3. and
in this place; The kind of tree is not named, as in Pſalm. 92.
12. and Eſa. 44. 3. but whatſoeuer it be, the compariſon wee
ſee is from a tree, not from fading graſſe, or ſuch a weake
thing, as a man naturally is compared vnto, Eſa. 40. 6. Iam. 1.
10. 1. Pet. 1. 24. and ſo are the wicked, Pſalm. 37. 2. and 92. 7.
but the godly are as a tree, teaching,
               That the godly are ſolidly grounded,Doct. 1. and ſtabliſhed in their
courſes, as hauing taken deepe root, Mat. 13. they are as mount
Sion, Pſal. 125. 1. Mat. 16. 18.
               This ſerues to abate the ſpirits of wicked men who attempt
to ouerthrow the godly,Vſe. but they meditate a vaine
thing, Pſal. 2. 1. for they are grounded and the Lord will ſtabliſh
them, as the Apoſtle prayeth, 2. Theſ. 2. 17. and will defend
them. Eſay. 10. 16.
               That they can endure heat and cold,Doct. 2. blaſts and ſhaking. Ier.
17. 8. Mat. 7. 25.
               Labour then to ſtand faſt,Vſe. all that profeſſe godlineſſe; and
conſider, Pro. 24. 10. Mat. 7. 26. 27.
               That their height ouertoppeth all the beaſts of the field,Doct. 3. that
with their feet they cannot tread them downe, that is, the power
of the wicked ſhall not preuaile againſt them. Pſal. 68. 1. 2. 3.
17. 18. 20. 35.
               Comfort vnto the Church,Vſe. and let not the godly fear their
enemies: conſider theſe Scriptures. Pſalm. 46. 1. 2. 5. 10. 11.
and 49. 14. and 97. 10. and 37. 13. 15. 17. and 29. 10. 11.
               
                  Planted.
                  Explanation] The worde ſhathul is properly ſpoken of that
which is remoued from one place to be ſet in another, Ezek.
17. 22. 23. ſhewing,
               
                  That a godly man is not in his naturall ſtate and growth;
                  Doct. 
                  for
by nature he is as others, gnets, lignum aridum, a dry logge
or tree. Ezek. 17. 24. fleſh of fleſh, Ioh. 3. 6. a child of wrath,
Eph. 2. 3. but the Lord hath remoued him from the ſtate of

corruption, and planted him in his houſe, Pſal. 92. 13. that is,
in the ſtate of grace, and ſanctification: thus the Church is
Gods plant, Eſa. 5. 7.
               Heereby let all naturall men iudge of their ſtate,Vſe. till they
be remoued thence, they are not to be accounted among the
godly, though they haue neuer ſo great gifts of nature: they
bee not the trees of righteouſneſſe, the planting of the Lord,
Eſa. 61. 3. but as fruitleſſe trees, in their proper ſoyle of corruption.
               That a godly man is ſo bleſſed,Doct. 2. not by natures production, but
by a spirituall plantation, in the ſtate of grace and regeneration
by the Lords hand, Eſa. 61. 3. and 60. 21. Ierem. 2. 21. Rom.
11. 24.
               To acknowledge thankefully our grace,Vſe. 1. and goodneſſe, to
be of God, and not of our ſelues; for it is hee that works will
and deed, Phil. 2. 13. and maketh barren & dry trees to flouriſh,
Ezek. 17. 24. Eſa. 44. 3. 4.
               A confutation to ſuch as exalt nature,Vſe. 2. and mans power in
his conuerſion, contrary to theſe Scriptures. Gen. 6. 5. and 8.
21. Eph. 2. 1. Phil. 2. 13. 2. Cor. 3. 5.
               
                  By the riuers of waters.
                  Explanatiō.] The word palge ſignifieth the diuiſion
of waters, it commeth of palag, to diuide, and ſo may
bee tranſlated brookes, becks, or as wee may ſay, riueretts,
ſtreames parted, Prou. 5. 15. 16. comming from a fountaine,
or head-ſpring, Iob. 29. 6. running in a pleaſant valley: whether
the waters come from aboue or below: for Ma
                        •
                     m is the
dual number, noting two ſorts of waters, which this tree
hath benefit of: from this ſimilitude we may learne▪
               
               
                  That a godly bleſſed man is planted in a pleaſant and fertile
valley,
                  Doct. 1. Ezek. 17. 5. as Adam in Paradiſe, Gen. 2. that is, in the
houſe of the Lord, Pſal. 92. 13. in ſpirituall Sion the ioy of the
whole earth, Pſal. 40. 2.
               To iudge the godly mans ſtation moſt happy,Vſe. 1. though it
cannot be diſcerned with the mortall eye of man, in his natural
eſtate: but his place is ſo pleaſant as the eye hath not ſeen,
&c. 1. Cor. 2. 9.
               The godly to reioyce in their portion,Vſe. 2. and in the lot of

their inheritance. Dauid deſired to dwell in Gods houſe for
euer, ſo pleaſant is that place: Pſalm. 84. 1. 2. 4. and 27. 4. and
26. 8.
               
                  That a godly man is ſo planted,
                  Doct. 2. 
                  as he hath the benefit of the ſpirituall
waters: as the type ſheweth, Ezek. 19. 10. Ierem. 17. 8.
Now theſe ſpirituall waters, Ezek. 47. 1.—are the graces of
Gods holy ſpirit, and the ſacred Scriptures, of which we may
reade, Pſal. 46. 4. Eſa. 12. 3. and 55. 1. and 44. 3. Iere. 2. 13. and
17. 13. Zach. 14. 8. Ioh. 4. 10. 14. and 7. 38. 39. 1. Cor. 3. 6.
               To labour to feele this benefit of the ſpirituall waters,Vſe 1. as
the tree doth of other waters: to ſpread in the roote, to be full
of ſappe, not to wither or to be dried vp, for want of moiſture:
but to be greene, and flouriſhing.
               This may ſhew men how to iudge of themſelues,Vſe 2. who are
without the graces of Gods ſpirit, and without the miniſterie
of the word, they be no trees of Gods planting, they be without
Chriſt, Rom. 8. 9. and in a periſhing condition, Prou. 29.
18. but theſe waters cauſe life, Ezek. 47. 9.
               
                  A bleſſed godly man ſo partakes of theſe ſpirituall waters,
                  Doct. 3. 
                  as
it is yet in meaſure: for he is not planted vpon the full waters,
but by the diuiſion of waters: ſo euery one receiueth according
to his meaſure, 1. Cor. 12. 11. Mat. 13. 23.
               Euery one to bee content with his portion in heauenly
things here:Vſe. for none can in this life bee perfect, and euerie
member is to bee ſo gifted, as one may benefit another, and
one ſtand in need of another.
               
                  That bringeth foorth] Iaten,
                  Explanation. 
                  will giue, the future here, noteth
a continuall act: it giueth, that is, it doth bring foorth freely,
and is continually fruitfull. Before is ſhewed the plantation,
and watering, that is, our ingrafting into Chriſt, and ſanctification
by the word and ſpirit, and here the fruit of both.
               The godly planted by the Lord (as is ſaid) are not barren trees,Doct. 1.
but fruitfull, and ſo continue: Ezek. 47. 12. Ier. 17. 8. Ioh. 15. 5.
Rom. 7. 4. Pſal. 52. 8. and 92. 14. Reuel. 2. 19. Mat. 7. 17.
               To ſhew foorth the fruits of our plantation,Vſe. 1. and ingrafting
into Chriſt: ſuch are fruitfull, Ioh. 15. 3. 4. and ſuch as haue
truly taſted of the heauenly waters, Col. 1. 6. 1. Theſſ. 1. 5. 6. 7.

2. Theſſ. 1. 3. 2. Pet. 1. 8. called trees of righteouſnes, Eſa. 61.
3. and 60. 21. fruitfull ſeede, Matth. 13. Mark. 4. 20. hereby
God is glorified, Ioh. 15. 8.
               This reproueth two ſorts:Vſe 2. Firſt, ſuch as bee fruitleſſe in
Gods houſe, Luk. 13. 7. Ioh. 15. 2. Secondly, ſuch as a while
are fruitfull, but at the length doe wither, not abiding in
Chriſt, Ioh. 15. 4. 6. Mat. 7. 18.
               
                  That planting,
                  Doct. 2. 
                  and that by the riuers of waters, goeth before
bringing foorth fruit: that is, the word, the ſpirit, and ingrafting
into Chriſt, before fruits of godlines. Ioh. 15. 4.
               To iudge hereby,Vſe. the cauſes of mens vnfruitfull profeſſion,
they haue not the effectuall worke of the Spirit and word of
God, neither are they in Chriſt, for then they ſhould be fruitfull,
Ioh. 15. 5. Rom. 6. 5. and 8. 5. 11.
               
                  His fruit] His fruit,Explanation. ſo called, as being the fruit of the plantation,
not of it ſelfe, as it naturally grew, for it hath the proper
fruit of the plantation, which is his fruit: thus is it with
the godly man: whence this doct.
               That a godly mans fruit,Doct. is not after the fleſh, according to
which he was borne, but after the ſpirit, by which he was regenerated:
Pro. 11. 30. Mat. 7. 17. 18.
               To learne to diſcerne of theſe ſpiritual trees by their fruits:Vſe 1.
for a good tree bringeth forth good fruit: Mat. 7. 17. 18. 20.
Rom. 6. 22. and 7. 4. 6. Gal. 5. 22.
               Alſo to diſcerne his fruits,Vſe 2. as he is a man: from his fruits as
he is a ſanctified man, to wit, as a tree planted by the heauenly
riuers of waters.
               
                  In his ſeaſon.
                  Explanatiō.] 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , in the opportunitie of time, in the
due and conuenient ſeaſon thereof, ſo taken, Pſal. 104. 27. and
145. 15. Leuit. 26. 4. Eccleſ. 3. 2. Eſa. 50. 4. Theſe words are
not added to make any thinke, that good fruit is at any time
vnſeaſonable, or that a man may vſe his libertie, to take his
owne time, to doe well when he liſt; but to commend a godly
mans goodnes. Teaching,
               
                  That a godly mans fruit is ripe fruite:
                  Doct. 1. it is done in iudgement
and truth, and not vntimely, (as the hypocrites be, and
the vainglorious) according as is ſaid, Pſal. 112. 5.
               
                  
To learne to doe good in mature deliberation,Vſe. that it doe
not putrifie and rot: as the vntimely fruite of hypocrites, and
the vainglorious, which come not from a ſanctified heart, as
from them that are ingrafted into Chriſt, whoſe fruite is durable.
               That he doth good in due time,Doct. 2. when occaſion fitly is offered, he
taketh it, as the good Samaritane, Luk. 10.
               To doe good in ſeaſon,Vſe 1. when fit occaſion is offered, Pro. 3.
28. for that is a good mans time, and then is the fruit ripe, pleaſant,
profitable, and moſt acceptable.
               
               Reproofe to ſuch,Vſe 2. as haue often occaſion fitly offered, to
ſhew foorth good fruits, and neglect the ſame. They bee not
like the godly diſpoſed Philippians, Phil. 4. 10. but like Diues,
that fruitleſſe tree, or Nabal that churle.
               
                  His leafe alſo ſhall not wither.
                  Explanation.] By the tree is ſet out a godly
man; by fruit, is to be vnderſtood his godlineſſe, and righteouſnes,
in word and deede: and by leaues, may be meant the
outward beautie, and well managing of his holy profeſſion,
in his countenance, geſture, and outward behauiour, which
be as pleaſant greene leaues, beautifying his conuerſation before
men. Hence note,
               That one truly religious,Doct. 1. is not a leafie tree without fruit, as
the hypocrite, who is all in ſhewes: nor a fruitfull tree without
leaues, as the raſh and headie perſon, wanting diſcretion. For both
leafe, and fruit, are here giuen to the godly man. So Ier. 17. 8.
Ezek. 47. 12.
               Not to be as the hypocrites,Vſe. all in profeſſion, and nothing
in practiſe: nor to thinke, that it is enough, to doe bonum, and
neglect benè, a good thing may be marred in the making: the
word ſpeaketh of our face, Pro. 17. 24. of our words, Pro. 15.
28. and 16. 23. and telleth vs of wiſedome, and diſcretion,
Pro. 19. 11. Pſalme 112. and of iudgement in our courſes,
Pro. 13. 23. Hereby ſhewing, that it is not enough to doe a
thing, but to doe it, as it ought to be done.
               That ſuch a one is euer greene, neuer vtterly deſtitute of ſpirituall
moiſture and ſappe of grace:Doct. 2.

Conſolation to the truly religious,Vſe. 1. that they ſhall neuer
wither away, Iere. 32. 40. 41. Ioh. 10. 28. Rom. 8. 30. not in the
hot ſummer of perſecutions, nor in the cold winter of a ſecure
carnall peace, nor in the luke-warme ſeaſon, of a pleaſing proſperous
eſtate, &c. God will not let his fade in grace, or faile
of their dutie wholly.

Reuel. 2. 10. Ezek. 18. 24. 2. Pet. 2. 21. not like Iudas, Mat. 27.
nor Herod, Mar. 6. nor Demas, 2. Tim. 4. 10. nor as the Angell
of Epheſus, Reuel. 2. 4. but as Thyatira, Reuel. 3. 19.
               A confutation of thoſe that hold that this planted tree may

                  And whatſoeuer] The Pſalmiſt ſpeakes very largely of a
godly mans proſperitie:Explanatiō. teaching,
               That there is a large extent of Gods goodneſſe towards the
godly.Doct. 
                  Geneſ. 39. 2. 5. 23. 2. Sam. 5. 10. Deut. 28. 2. Chron.
32. 30.
               To labour to be truly religious,Vſe. ſithen God doth ſo bleſſe
his, which is moſt true, if we conſider the end of the godly, for
all things tend to make their end happie. Rom. 8. 28. Pſalme
37. 37.
               
                  He doth] Neither before,Explanatiō. nor yet after in this Pſalme, (in
which a godly man bleſſed, is deſcribed) is any mention
plainly of his ſpeeches, but of his delight, meditation, and
doing: not that a godly man hath not aſwell good words, as
workes, Pſal. 15. but to teach vs,
               That a godly man is more to be meaſured,Doct. and more certainly to
be knowne, both to himſelfe and to others, by inward delight, and a
minde ſet vpon heauenly things, and by outward practiſes, then by
words, be they neuer ſo faire and glorious.
               Therefore let vs iudge our ſelues,Vſe▪
                   and others by our delight
inwardly, and practiſes outwardly, in good things, rather
then by our tongues. It is neither profeſſion, nor preaching,
without internall grace, and externall fruits of pietie, that
can make vs worthy the account of ſound Chriſtians. Mat. 7.
21. 23.
               
                  
                  Shall prosper.
                  Explanation.] Iatſliach, hee ſhall make to proſper: being
reſtrained to good things which hee taketh in hand. Wee
learne,
               
                  That a godly man is a cunning Artiſt in holy things:
                  Doct. they
thriue in his hand. 2. Chron. 31. 21. Geneſis 39. 2. Ioſeph
was a man that proſpered, or as wee ſay a luckie man.
               To become a proficient in heauenly things,Vſe. and to thriue
ſpiritually by them, bee a good man, and doe that thou doſt
ſincerely, as Hezekiah, ſo ſhalt thou proſper, elſe thou wilt
be (as we ſay) but a bungler in good things.
               If this proſpering be referred to al things in general which
he doth,Explanation it muſt ſignifie his good vſe hee can make thereof,
and ſo proſper thereby towards God. For heere is meant
not the worldly, but ſpirituall proſperity. Teaching,
               
                  That the godly man,
                  Doct. 
                  can (like a good husband) gaine good
to his ſoule, and prosper ſo in all his doings, for ſo God inſtructeth
him. Dauid and S. Paul ſhew vs this truth, if wee conſider
well of them.
               Let vs learne to be ſuch heauenly good husbands in matters
concerning our ſoules,Vſe. in all our doings to bee rich towards
God. This is one of the greateſt points of wiſedome,
to be able to make aduantage to our ſoules of proſperity, aduerſity,
of health, ſicknes, of good and ill report, &c.
               This third verſe doth teach,Explanation wherein a godly man is bleſſed,

thereof, ſhewing,

                  Firſt, in that hee is planted. Secondly,
that it is by the riuers of waters. Thirdly, in being made fruitfull,
and that with good fruit ſeaſonably. Fourthly, by his green
leaues, neuer fading. Fifthly, in his proſperous and happy ſucceſſe,
which by right belongeth vnto him: this God promiſeth
the godly heere, and Deut. 28. 2—8.
               To beholde with comfort the particulars of Gods bleſſings
to a godlie man,Vſe 1. therby to iudge of his happines, and
to ſtriue to partake thereof with him.
               To be prouoked vnto godlines:Vſe. 2. for proſperity is promiſed
for a reward: and the godly onely haue a right vnto it

by promiſe. And if we enioy not heere proſperity; and that
it goe not well with vs, it is for that wee doe not well: and
therefore God reſtraineth vs heere thereof, that we may not
loſe the perfection of happines in the life to come. Elſe he taketh
pleaſure in his people. Pſal. 149. 4. Hee delighteth to
doe vs good, Ier. 32. 41. and deſires our well-doing. Deutr.

moſt different, and oppoſite heereunto, as in regard of
their ſtudies and affections, ſo of the ſucceſſe thereof alſo.
They regard not Gods Law, and God as little with his fauour

               Heeere the Pſalmiſt maketh the Antitheſis betweene the
Godly and the wicked: to teach,
               That a godly mans bleſſednes is better diſcerned,Doct. by ſetting
ouer againſt him in one view, the ſtate of the wicked. Thus doth
Salomon in many places of the Prouerbs, cap 3. 32. 33. and 4.

godly and vngodly: hence teaching,
               
                  That there is altogether a great difference between the godly
and the wicked.
                  Doct. The proofe heereof are the places of the
former doctrine. And alſo wee may ſee heere, that what
before is affirmed of the godly, is denied altogether of the
wicked.
               To hold a great difference to be,Vſe. between the wicked and
godly; for that which is ſaid truely of the one (not as a man,
but as a godly man) is denied to the other, (not as a man, but
as a wicked man.) It is godlines, and vngodlineſſe, which
maketh the difference which is heere ſpoken of.
               In taking theſe words (not ſo) and applying them to all
that which is ſaid of the godly,Explanatiō. not to bee ſo to the vngodly:
would afford many doctrines.
               1.Doct. 1. That a wicked man (whatſoeuer he be) is not bleſſed. Pſ.

9. 17.
               To pull down the proud conceit of the wicked,Vſe. liuing in
pleaſure and proſperity: they muſt know that yet they are
not to be accounted bleſſed.
               That the wicked are not planted,Doct. 2. but remaine in their naturall
ſtanding, though
                     •
                   they bee in the Church, yet are not of it;
Like Simon Magus, Ananias and Saphira, Hymenaeus and Alexander,
and ſuch like.
               
               So long as men liue vnreformed,Vſe. neuer to hold them to be
plants of the Lord, which are trees of righteouſneſſe. Eſa. 61.

one day ſhall be cut downe, and caſt into the fire, Mat. 3. 10.
and 7. 19. Luke 13. 7. 9. Iohn 15. 6.
               That they haue no linely root,Doct. 3. nor doe feele the ſauing operation
of the riuers of water, as the godly doe.
               To iudge our ſelues to be godlie,Vſe. or not ſo, as wee take
root in righteouſnes, and benefit by the word, and power of
Gods holy ſpirite: theſe ſprituall waters of life.
               As in theſe is ſhewed,Explanation that the wicked are otherwiſe then

heere onely is briefly ſet downe.

                  That which they doe is rotten and vntimely fruit.5.
                  
                  They in time wither for want of root,6. and moysture.
                  Goodnes proſpereth not with them;7. or, in the end they ſhall be
knowne not to be proſperous. Pſ. 5. 5. Iob. 21. 18.
               
               To diſcouer by all theſe,Vſe. who are to be iudged wicked: and
if we doe finde our ſelues hereby among them, let vs depart
from the tents of theſe wickedmen, leſt partaking of their ſins

                  But are.
                  Explanation] Before is ſhewed what they are not, now is noted
what they be.
               True iudgement is a certaine affirming what a thing is,Doct. and
not onely a denying what it is not: or, it is not enough to know
what the wicked are not, but alſo what they be.
               Look to the well informing of our iudgements;Vſe. for ſound
knowledge can poſitiuely ſet downe the tenent held.
               
                  Like.
                  Explanation] Heere the Pſalmiſt ſetteth out the vngodly men, as
before he did the godly man, by a ſimilitude; to teach vs—
               
                  That the vngodly mans wretched and miſerable eſtate,
                  Doct. 
                  is not
eaſily diſcerned: and therefore heere it is illuſtrated by a ſimilitude,
and Dauid acknowledgeth this, Pſal. 73. 16.
               Not to conſider ſuperficially or ſleightly of the wicked
mens eſtate:Vſe. but ſeriouſly to take view thereof, by this and
ſuch like ſimilitudes, painting them out in liuely colours: elſe
if we behold them according to their outward worldly and
tranſitory glory, we ſhall be much deceiued, & greatly tempted,
as was Ieremy, cap 12. Dauid. Pſ. 73. and others, Mal. 3.
               
                  
                  Chaffe.
                  Explanatiō.] Mots ſignifieth chaffe, or any light and contemptible
thing: the Septuagint tranſlate it by 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which is duſt,
as well as chaffe. So are they compared; alſo note, that in
ſpeaking of the wicked, and comparing them, hee ſpeakes
plurally, as vnderſtanding all: but of the godly hee ſpeaketh
ſingularly, in one, to know them all. Teaching,
               That one godly man is of more account with God,Doct. 1. then all
the wicked, as much as one godly fruitfull tree, is better than all
chaffie duſt, or dusty chaffe in the world. See this in Gods fauour
to Noah alone, among a world of wicked men. Gen. 6.
So to Lot in Zodome, Gen. 19. ſo alſo, Ierem. 39. 11. 16.
               Great comfort to the godly,

Lord taketh pleaſure in them. Pſal. 149. 4. more then in all
the reſt of the world, Eſai. 43. 4.

than of all the wicked. Pſal. 101. 6. and 119. 63. Prou. 10.
20. For the tongue of the iuſt is as fined ſiluer: but the heart
of the wicked is little worth: the godly are as the apple of
Gods eye, Zach. 2. 8. they be his peculiar people, right deare
and precious in his ſight, 1. Pet. 2 9. Exo. 19. 5. Pſal. 135. 4.
               
                  That all the wicked are alike: they are all, euen the whole
ranke of them,Doct. 2. 
                  walkers as well as ſtanders and ſitters, the leaſt
in euill, as wel as the deepeſt in tranſgreſſion, all are but as very
duſt and chaffe, moſt contemptible with God. Pſal. 119, 119.

to be toſſed too and fro: the word nadaph, ſignifieth to driue

               VERSE. V.
               Therefore the wicked ſhall not ſtand in iudgement,Text. nor ſinners
in the aſſemblie of the righteous.
               THerefore they ſhall not beMatth. 3. 12. Eſa. 30. 28. and 14. 16. Iere. 51. 2. able to endure the triall:Paraphraſe. but
when the Ancient of daies ſhall ſit, and the Lord ſhall
prepare his throne for iudgement, (though they doe appeare

of confidence in their cauſe, feare and terror ſhall make them
Mat. 24. 30. Luke 23. 30. Eſa. 2. 19. Reuel. 6. 16. hang downe their heads. And howſoeuer here they liue among
the iuſt, and ouertop them too: yet then, as men confounded

                  Therefore] This verſe is an inference,Explanation. which the Pſalmiſt
maketh, vpon the conſideration of the vanitie of the wicked,
the chaffie people, becauſe he knowes them to be but chaffe,
hee concludeth their ouerthrow and ruine, and that out of
themſelues:Doct. 1. hence informing vs in theſe truths,
               
                  That the true vnderſtanding and knowledge of the nature of

the wicked▪ giueth vs a right iudgement of their end: which the
Prophet Dauid ſheweth in many places; for deſcribing thē,
he concludeth thereupon their miſerable end: Pro. 6. 12.—15.
Pſal. 37. 12. 13. and 2. 2. 3. 4. 5. 9. and 52. 1—5. and 53. 1—5.
but the concluſion made,Note. is turned ſometimes into a prayer,
as in Pſal. 10. there is a deſcription of the wicked from verſe
2.—11, then the 12. 14. 15. are a prayer: and in the 16 verſe a
prophecie. So Pſal. 28. 3—5. and 36. 1—4. 12. Sometime it is
an exhortation, as in Pſal. 50. verſ. 16—21. 22.
               To iudge wiſely of the end of the wicked,Vſe. 1. learne to know
well their nature and conditions.
               Let the wicked learne therefore to know themſelues,Vſe 2. that
thereby they may conſider of their end, and by feare of deſtruction,
be moued to leaue off their ſinning: The not knowing
of themſelues maketh them ſecure in their courſes, careleſſe
of reformation, and preſumptuouſly confident of the
ioyes of Heauen, the reward only of well doing.
               To lay open the nature and properties of the wicked out of
the word,Vſe 3. that hereby they may ſee and diſcerne themſelues,
and thereby their end, except they be reformed. The Prophet
Dauid in the Pſalmes, and Salomon his ſonne in the Prouerbs,
doe moſt excellently, and very largely teach the Church of
God this point, that by knowing what they are, the godly
may iudge rightly, what they ſhall be, except they bee reformed.
               
                  That the deſtruction of the wicked,
                  Doct. 2. 
                  is of, and from themſelues:
for the cauſe of their not being able to abide the iudgement,
is their owne emptines and vanitie. The Prophet ſaith of Iſrael,
that her ruine was of her ſelfe, Hoſ. 13. 9. See Numb. 16.
38. Eſa. 3. 9.
               To iuſtifie God in his iudgements,Vſe. as 2. Chron. 12. 6. Pſal.
119. 70. and to condemne our ſelues for our ſinnes: for our
owne wickedneſſe bringeth vpon vs deſtruction. Eſa. 9. 18.
               
                  The vngodly] As the Pſalmiſts make them all like chaffe:Explanatiō.
ſo here hee ſpeaketh ſtill plurally, to make them all ſubiect to
miſerie, in the day of iudgement: ſhewing,
               That as all the wicked are chaffe:Doct. ſo the ſame end ſhall be alike,

at the laſt to them all, Pſal. 9. 17. Matth. 25. 41.
               Let not the wicked deceiue themſelues:Vſe. they here indeed
differ in outward ſtate much; ſome rich, ſome poore, ſome
honourable, ſome baſe, ſome learned, other ignorant: but becauſe
they bee all of them chaffie, they ſhall all haue the end
that chaffe is appointed vnto, Matth. 3. 12.
               
                  Shall not ſtand in iudgement.
                  Explanatiō.] The Pſalmiſt may here ſeeme
to expound the ſimilitude: meaning by chaffe the vngodly▪
                   by
driuing away, not ſtanding: and by winde, iudgement: to
ſhew,
               That it is vſuall in Scripture,Doct. and ſpecially here in the Pſalmes,
and Prouerbs, to admit of variation in words: as Deut. 32. 2.
Pſal. 32. 1. 2. and 34. 1. and 33. 6.
               To obſerue this,Vſe. and for the better informing of our vnderſtanding
herein: note, that this variation is to expreſſe
commonly one of theſe three things:Note. I. The ſame ſenſe: this
moſt vſuall, and it is to explane the meaning more at large: as
the places quoted ſhew. So Pſalm. 33. 11. Prou. 7. 18. 25. 27.
and 1. 5. 15. and 2. 3. 4. II. The ſenſe that is nigh vnto it, as

39. and 20. 8. God riſeth vp to iudgement, Pſal. 76. 9. To ſtand
then, is to be able to abide the countenance and ſentence of
the Iudge, without feare, Luk. 21. 36. And to ariſe or fall, is to
bee iuſtified or condemned, Mat. 12. 41. Reuel. 6. 17. Hence
may we be informed,
               
                  That there is a iudgement,

               That albeit the wicked ſhall all appeare,Doct. 2. 
                  Iere. 25. 31. 2. Cor. 5.

10. Eccleſ. 12. 14. (the words are generall) yet ſhall they not ariſe
vp, that is, be iuſtified; nor ſtand, that is, be acquited, but be
condemned, and driuen, as chaffe with the winde, from Gods preſence,
Mat. 25. 41.
               Let the wicked that now ſtand vp,Vſe. 1. and beare a ſway till
iudgement come, learne betime to humble themſelues: for
God will ouerthrow the wall of their defence at the length,
Ezek. 13. 13. Deut. 29. 19. Reuel. 6. 15. and ſend fanners to
fanne them, Iere. 51. 2.
               Let none eſteeme of the wicked as they be priſed in their
weight of earthly honour and riches:Vſe 2. but as they ſhall bee
found by iudgement then, of a chaffie nature, lighter then vatie,
Pſal. 62. 9. like Balſhazzer, too light in the Lords weights
and ballance, Dan. 5. 27.
               
                  Nor the ſinners in the congregation of the righteous.
                  Explanatiō. The word
ſtand is here againe to be repeated: and the wicked are called
ſinners, Chataim, ſuch as adde ſinne to ſinne, liuing, and accuſtoming
themſelues to ſinne: See verſ. 1. of this word. Theſe
are they that cannot ſtand in the congregation of the righteous.
From this we learne,
               That it is all one,Doct. 1. to riſe vp in iudgement, and in the aſſembly of
the righteous: and they that cannot ſtand vp in the one, neither
can they ſtand vp with the other.
               Hence let all conſider,Vſe. what it is therefore, to be with, or againſt,
to approue or deſpiſe,Doct. 2. the aſſemblie of the righteous.
               That not ſuch as haue ſinned, but ſuch as are ſinners, ſhall not
be allowed of God among the righteous.
               To take heede in iudgement we be not found ſinners:Vſe. all
haue ſinned, Rom. 3. and none but hath ſinne, 1. Ioh. 1. but all
are not ſinners. It is not ſimply ſinne, but liuing without repentance
in ſinne with the ſinner, that cuts men off from the
godly.
               That it is a puniſhment to the wicked ſinners,Doct. 3. not to be allowed
among, but to be driuen from, the aſſembly of the righteous: either
here, as 1. Cor. 5. 5. 13. 1. Tim. 1. 20. or as in the laſt day,
Matth.
                  Vſe. 25.
               Let ſuch as doe (in contempt of the godly) diuide themſelues

from them, know that once it ſhall be their puniſhment.

                  For the Lord] The Pſalmiſt,Explanation. hauing ſet out the godly and
wicked ſo differingly, being now to conclude, he fetcheth the
reaſon of all this from the Lord, and not out of the men themſelues:
teaching,
               That it is of the Lord,Doct. and not of men, that there is ſuch a difference
of perſons, ſome godly, ſome vngodly, ſome righteous,
ſome ſinners, &c. Eſa. 60. 21. and 61. 3. Pſal. 147. 2. Act. 2. 47.
Rom. 9. 16. 17. 18. 21.
               Giue glorie vnto the Lord for thy goodneſſe,Vſe. and pray to
him; for thy brethren: for what thou haſt, it is receiued from
him and what they want, they cannot enioy, but by him.
               
                  Knoweth the way of the righteous.
                  Explanation.] The word knoweth is not
to be taken for knowledge ſimply, as Rom. 1. 21. Nehe. 6. 12.
or to acknowledge, as Act. 19. 15. but for loue, care, and to
be pleaſed with, Pſal. 37. 18. 23. and 31. 7. and 144. 3. Pro. 12.
10. Iob. 9. 21. as may appeare by the contrary, Pſalm. 101. 4.
Matth. 7. 23. The Doctrines from theſe words are,
               That there bee ſuch as are righteous,Doct. 1. and ſo to bee accounted:
Pſal. 32. 1. 11. and 37. 29. Prou. 2. 20. Mat. 25. 37. 46.
               To receiue this truth,Vſe 1. but yet not according to the law of
workes, Pſal. 143. 2. Rom. 3. 20. Gal. 2. 16. Iob. 25. 4. but after
the law of grace and faith, Rom. 3. 24. and 5. 1. Galath. 3.
8. 11.
               
                  
To reioyce that any man may bee held righteous in Gods
mercie,Vſe. 2. ſeeing in our ſelues wee are ſo wicked: for ſuch righteous
ones are bleſſed, Pſalme 32. 1. 2. 11. ſo verſ. 1. of this
Pſalme.
               
                  That theſe righteous ones haue a way or path to walke:
                  Doct. 2. for
here it is ſaid the way of the righteous, aſcribing to them a
way: ſee Pro. 2. 20. and 14. 8.
               To ſearch out this way,Vſe. to walke with the righteous in it,
it is not the way of nature, nor a path vpon the earth, that
men tread in, nor the way of corruption, Gen. 6. 12. Pro. 4. 14.
but the good way, 1. Sam. 12. 23. 1. King. 8. 36. the old way,
Iere. 6. 16. yet the new and liuing way, Heb. 10. 20. the way
of peace, Rom. 3. 17. the way of wiſedome, Pro. 4. 11. of perfection—of
life, Pro. 10. 17. and the way of good men. Prouerbs
2. 20.
               That the Lord knoweth this their way,Doct. 3. 
                  Pſal. 37. 18. 23.
               To reioyce and comfort thoſe that be godly,Vſe. that the Lord
approueth and is well pleaſed with their way: though men
be not. Let them meditate on Pſal. 37. 5. 6. 7. verſes.
               That this knowing and approuing of their way by the Lord,Doct. 4. is
the true cauſe of their happineſſe and ſaluation. Epheſ. 2. 8.
               Not to looke vpon thy goodneſſe,Vſe. or grace, thy godlineſſe,
and iuſtice: but magnifie the Lords mercie, that is pleaſed to
approue of thee.
               Note for a concluſion of this,Explanatiō. that the Pſalmiſt beginneth
ſingularly, as ſpeaking but of one, verſ. 1. 2. 3. but heere hee
ends plurallie (ſaying the righteous) as including all: to
teach,
               That the deſcription here ſet downe,Doct. is not of one ſingular godly
man: but is the liuely picture of all the righteous.
               Let all them behold this paterne to draw themſelues therby,Vſe.
if they would be accounted among the righteous.
               
                  But the way of the vngodly ſhall periſh.
                  Explanation] Heere the Prophet
ſheweth on the contrary the end of the wicked: and from
this may we learne,
               
                  That periſhing in the end is the portion of the vngodly,
                  Doct. 1. euen to
all of them, from the wicked vngodly, to the lewd ſinner, and

from this to the proud ſcorner: for heere the word is in the
plurall number riſhangnim, Pſalm. 9. 17. and 11. 6. and 37. 38.
Mat. 25. 33. 41. 46. Pro. 11. 7. Rom. 2. 8. 9. Reuel. 20. 10. 15.
               You wicked before the time of vengeance come,Vſe 1. behold
your end euery one of you, and repent, and pray God, if it be
poſſible, that your wickedneſſe may be done away.
               Let not any godly,Vſe. 2. bee they neuer ſo poore, enuie the proſperitie
of the wicked, Prou. 24. 1. and 3. 31. and 23. 17. 18.
Pſal. 37. 1. 2. and 129. 6.
               That their way,Doct. 2. that is, their counſels, ſtudies, endeuours, practiſes,
alſo their glorie, power, honour, and authoritie, ſhall haue a
diſmall day, and come to a miſerable end: Pſal. 37. 2. 14. 17. 35.
36. Pro. 11. 7. and 13. 9.
               To looke to our way what it is:
                     Ʋſe 1. if it bee the way of the
wicked, it is the way of wickedneſſe, Pſal. 139. 24. the way of
darkneſſe, Prou. 2. 13. the broad way leading to deſtruction.
Matth. 7. 13.
               The godly to be content,Vſe 2. and patiently waite, and not feare
the power, policie, and practiſes of the wicked; they ſhall
haue an end.
               Note here that periſhing,Explanation. is oppoſed to the Lords knowing
and approuing of the godly, which is not ſpoken of the
wicked: to teach,
               
                  That for want of Gods approbation,
                  Doct. 
                  the wicked and their way
doe periſh: His not knowing, that is, his not approuing them,
is his reiection of them, and ſo their vtter deſtruction. Matth.
7. 23.
               Therefore aboue all things let vs labour for Gods approbation:Vſe.
for if he iuſtifie, who can condemne? Rom. 8. 33. 34.
but if the Lord be againſt vs, who can pleade for vs? 1. Sam.

            The ſecond Pſalme.
            
               THE ARGVMENT.
               THis Pſalme is in order the ſecond, Acts 13. 33. though
ſome haue held it all one with the firſt, this ending with
bleſſed, as the other therewith beginneth. It hath no title, but
is aſcribed by the holy Apoſtles vnto Dauid, Acts 4. 25. who is
thought to haue penned it, after his victories ouer the Philiſtines,
who gathered themſelues againſt him, when the people
had made him King in Sauls roome. In which, as in many other
things he was a type of Chriſt, of whom alſo this Pſalm ſpeaketh.
Acts 4. 25. 26. 27. Heere Dauid the King, Dauids kingdome,
and his enemies, ſet out Chriſt the Meſſiah our King, his kingdome,
and enemies rebelling againſt him. It is a mixt Pſalme,
containing Doctrine,
                  The princpiall point of the Pſalme. 
                  Propheſie, and exhortation: the principall
point in it, is this, that as Dauid by Gods appointment, was
to rule in Sion; and to ſubdue the nations (maugre their harts)
ſo Chriſt Ieſus (as here is fore-promiſed, and now is fulfilled) by
the appointment of God his father, was to be establiſhed in his
kingdome, and therein to beare rule, as is ſhewed in verſ. 6. 7. 8.
9. in deſpight of all his enemies, not being able by their power, or
policie, to withſtand him, as verſ. 1. 2. 3. 4. doe manifeſt, but
ſhould in the appointed time, feele the power of his heauy, and
wrathfull indignation? if they did continue to oppoſe him. verſ.
5. And therefore the Pſalmiſt hereof certainely perſwaded and
wiſhing ſaluation to ſuch, as God hath ordained to be ſaued, exhorteth
them to be wiſe, to feare the Lord, to ſerue him, and to
doe him homage, leaſt they periſh, pronouncing them contrarily
to be moſt happie, which doe yeeld all humble ſubiection, and
doe put their truſt in him. ver. 10. 11. 12.
            
            
               
               The vſe and profit of this Pſalme.
               IT is a propheticall hiſtory, or an hiſtorical prophecy in Dauid
the type of Chriſt Ieſus the Antitype. I. Shewing how
he ſhall be King. II. That he ſhall haue many enemies of the
meaneſt, as alſo of the mightieſt, banding themſelues together
againſt him. III. That yet for the Churches comfort,
their attempts,Pſalm. 7. 14. ſtudies, conſultations, power, pollicy and
rage, ſhall proue to bee of none effect: let them trauell with
wickednes, and conceiue miſchiefe, they ſhall yet bring forth
a lye: for Chriſt ſhall confound them. So as in this Pſalme
the godly may comfort themſelues in an aſſured victory againſt
their enemies, they may hereby in their faith be ſtrengthened,
touching all their ſpirituall aſſaults made for the ouerthrow
of Chriſts kingdome, againſt which the gates of
hell ſhall not preuaile. In all their miſeries, afflictions and
troubles, they may haue recourſe vnto Chriſt their King and
Soueraigne, for aide and defence, who is able, and will alſo
reuenge their iuſt quarrell, with his iron ſcepter vpon thoſe
baſe and earthen veſſels. And heere the wicked that cannot
away to be vnder Chriſts eaſie yoke, neither may endure to
beare his light burthen, may in time learne to bee wiſe, and
to ſerue the Lord, reioycing in trembling: leſt the Lords anger
be ſtirred vp againſt them, to their vtter confuſion. He is
a Lambe, he is a Lion: as a Sauiour, ſo a Iudge. Hee hath the
ſentence of abſolution, Come ye bleſſed, and the ſentence of
condemnation, Goe ye curſed: he treaſureth vp mercies for
thoſe that bee his. Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in
him: but reſerueth vengeance: vialls full of wrath to be poured
on the head and hairy ſcalp of all that riſe vp againſt him.
            
            
               
               The reſolution of this Pſalme.
               
                  This Pſalme hath two parts:

                        1. A twofolde
narration.

                              1. Of the attempts

type, and of

antitype, ſet
downe

                                    1. By way of interrogation, admiring their folly to
goe about that, which was impoſſible to effect.
verſ. 1.
                                    2. By an affirmatiue
declaration,

from the

                                                1. Perſons conſpiring:

and Princes.
                                                2. Perſons againſt

                                          2. Of their encouraging one another
to this rebellion. ver. 3.
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                              2. Of Gods
maintaining
both the one
& the other:
& this again
is twofold:

                                    1. Of the power
of God
whereby he

                                          1. Scorneth their attempts, as not
able to doe harme. verſ. 4.
                                          2. Confoundeth them in his diſpleaſure.
verſ 5.
                                          3. Annointeth his King, and ſetteth
him ouer Sion. verſ. 6.
                                       
                                    
                                    2. Of his mercy
manifeſting
his decree,
if this
might moue
thē to obey,
and that

                              2. Reaſons to moue hereunto,
which are

                                    1. His diſpleaſure, and the euill that

               The generall obſeruations.
               IN this Pſalme thus ſetting out Ieſus Chriſt his perſon, his
offices, his kingdome, ſo fully before hand to the people of
God in the old Teſtament, as it is now verily fulfilled in our
eyes, we may learne, I. That this Pſalme was not of any priuate
interpretation, but was deliuered by Dauid, as hee was
moued by that vn-erring ſpirit of God, as all holy men were,
2. Pet. 1. 20. 21. II. That the doctrine of the Goſpell of
Chriſt and his kingdome was no new doctrine, when he was
incarnate, which hee and his Apoſtles taught; but that pure
and moſt holy ancient truth deliuered before in the holie
Scriptures, as the word ſheweth, Luk. 24. 27. 44. Acts 26. 22.
and 28. 23. III. That as the knowledge of Chriſt was reueiled
vnto the holie men of God: ſo they taught the ſame
which they did receiue concerning him, (and as wee now beleeue)
vnto the people of God. So Iacob, Geneſ. 49. 10. 11.

               Why doe the people rage,Text. and the people murmure in vaine?

laid help vpon one that is mighty; I haue found
Dauid my ſeruant, with mine holy oyle haue I
annoynted him: mine hand ſhall be eſtabliſhed
with him, and mine arme ſhall ſtrengthen him:
myPſal. 89. 34. 35 couenant with him will I not breake, nor alter the thing
that is gone out of my mouth; I haue ſworne by my holineſſe
that I will not faile Dauid. And not onely for Dauid himſelf,
but for hisPſal. 89. 36. ſeede alſo, the ſame God hath promiſed that it
ſhould be for euer, and his throne as the Sunne before him:
that of his ſeed he would raiſe vp his ſon Chriſt according to
the fleſh, to whom he hath ſaid,Pſal. 110. 1. 2. Sit thou on my right hand,
till I make thine enemies thy footſtoole; be thou Ruler in the
middeſt of thine enemies: what then, not onely wickedneſſe,
but folly is this? worthie to be wondred at, both of the Heathen
round about, and the Iewiſh people, that they ſhould ſo
ſtorme hereat, & mutter amongſt themſelues, as if they could
hinder this counſell and worke of God, which is moſt impoſſible.
               
                  Why?
                  Explanation.] Dauid conſidering what is in the verſes, 6. 7. 8. 9. in
this, from a holie ſecuritie, and ſure faith with which he concludeth
in the end, he admiring alſo their follie and madneſſe
doth demaund, and thus as a religious inſulting maketh a queſtion:
to teach,
               That the godly in their certaine knowledge of their ſafe estate,Doct. 1.
and in full aſſurance of victorie ouer Christs, and their enemies,
doe make light account of their attempts. Eſa. 37. 22.

God himſelfe wondereth thereat. Eſa. 59. 16.
               Seeing people will be ſometime ſo vnreaſonable,Vſe. let vs trie,
and as we finde, ſo iudge, and not for the number be brought

counſell of Iſai. chap. 8. 11. 12. 13.

were Dauids enemies nigh at hand.
               They that border nigheſt vpon the dwelling of the righteous,Doct. if
they become not one with the people of God, will proue hatefull
foes to them: as all theſe nations did to Dauid and Iſrael: and
ſo other in Nehemiahs daies, chap. 4. 1. 7. 8.
               To be wiſe and watchful with Nehemiah,
                  Vſe. and to haue euer
an eye vpon thoſe that will not be of our religion, and yet be

occaſion, they will with Sanballat, Tobiah the Ammonite and
others, ſhew it to the full.Explanation.
               
               
                  Rage] The word ragſhu is tumultuouſly as in an vprore to
come together, as Pſal. 64. 2. and the word Ephruaxan, Act. 4.
25. noteth rage, pride, and fiercenes, as horſes that neigh and
ruſh into the battell: and all this was, for that God had exalted
Dauid, who was a man ſeeking the welfare of Iſrael.
               Some enemies of the Church,Doct. 1. are violent, furious, and raging as
beasts, Act. 19. 28. 29. 32. Luk. 4. 28. 29. The word is vſed in

                  &c.] Theſe were enemies to Dauid within
the Church, to wit, of the Iſraelites: as Abner, with all that
tooke part with the houſe of Saul, 2. Sam. 3. who were herein

               That heathen,Doct. that is enemies out of the Church, as were the
Philistims, 2. Sam. 5. 17. the Iebuſites, chap. 5. 6. and heatheniſh
people, the wicked within the Church, as Sauliſts, vnnaturall Abſhalomites
cannot be willing to ſubiect themſelues to the beſt, and

               To take notice of mens rebellious natures,Vſe. 1. which cannot
endure any ſubiection, no not to the beſt gouernours in the

               To learne therefore not raſhly to lay the fault vpon Princes,Vſe. 2.
becauſe of the rage of the heathen, or tumultuous oppoſition
and murmuring of their ſubiects againſt them: for ſo
ſhould meeke Moſes, holy Samuel, and zealous Dauid be condemned.
               As Dauid found enemies both abroad and at home,Explanatiō. of heathen,

8. 10. and 41. 10.—16.
               That the wicked can come together,Doct. 4. and conſent without iarring,
againſt God and his people. Ioſ. 9. 2. and 10. 5. Pſal. 48.
4. and 94. 21. and 83. 6—8. Acts. 4. 27.
               Let the godly heere learne to be one for goodnes,Vſe 1. as the
wicked can be one for wickednes.
               This may reproue ſuch as profeſſe to do well,Vſe. 2. but yet cannot
agree together, and be of one mind to further the ſame,
as indeed they ought.
               Here is to bee obſerued further,Explanatiō. how Gods enemies, as
they be of diuers ſorts, ſo ſome rage, ſome plot and deuiſe,
ſome proudly ſtand vp in ſtrength, ſome aſſiſt by counſell to
bring their deuiſes to paſſe. Hereby teaching,
               
                  That Sathan hath his ſeuerall inſtruments:
                  Doct. 
                  working in them
and by them in a differing ſort, against the Lord and his people;
as may appeare here in the enemies againſt Dauid and Iſrael,
as this hiſtory ſheweth in 1. and 2. of Samuell, and againſt
Chriſt, and the Chriſtian Church, as the Euangeliſts, the Acts
and hiſtory Eccleſiaſticall witneſſe.
               The godly muſt hence bee warned,Vſe. to get a ſpeciall aſſurance
of Gods ayde, to ſtay themſelues with comfort, in his
wiſedome againſt their policy, in his might againſt their
ſtrength, and in his mercy againſt their wrath. For God is
all ſufficient for his people to defend them, to ſupply what
on their part is wanting, and to ouerthrow their enemies.
               Againſt the Lord,Explanation and againſt his annointed.
               By annointed we are to vnderſtand Dauid the annointed
King of Iſraell, 1. Sam. 16. 12. 13. Pſalme. 89. 21. a type of
Chriſt, who elſe where is called Dauid, Ier. 39 9. Ezek. 34.
23. 24. Hoſ. 3. 5. he knowing his calling inſulteth ouer his

enemies, and telleth them they fight againſt God, and ſhall
not preuaile: teaching,
               That the Reſiſters of Gods ordinance,Doct. 1. and appointment in
the ministery of his ſeruants, are truely 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , fighters againſt
God himſelfe, Acts. 5. 39. and 7. 51. Romanes. 13. 1. 2. Luke
10. 16.
               To be ſubiect therefore to the power ordained of God,Vſe. 1.
and not to reſiſt the ſame, Rom. 13. 1. 2.
               To be a comfort to ſuch as be eſtabliſhed by the Lord;Vſe. 2. in
this that their enemies are Gods enemies.
               There are counſells and aſſemblies as well againſt the Lord,Doct. 2.
as for him. Mich. 6. 16. 1. King. 12. 28. 29. Dan. 3. 1.—Mat.
26. 66. and 27. 1.
               Therefore this confutes Papiſts,Vſe. 1. who hold that counſells
cannot erre.
               Not raſhly to approoue euery thing that is concluded by
counſells,Vſe. 2. but follow the Apoſtles aduiſe, 1. Theſſal. 5. 21.

               Not to bee offended,Vſe. 3. if authority haue an eye vnto aſſemblies,
to preuent conuenticles and vnlawfull meetings.
               By annointed is alſo heere meant Chriſt the Meſſiah,Explanation the
annointed, Acts 4. 24. He is called annointed becauſe of his
offices, of which there were three types annointed, as Kings,
1. Sam. 16. 12. 13. and 24. 26. So Prieſts, Exodus. 30. 30.
and Prophets, 1. King. 19. 16. who alſo are called the Lords
annointed, Pſal. 105. 15. to teach vs,
               That they bee enemies to God the Father,Doct. 1. who are againſt
Chriſt his annointed, Luke 10. 16.
               Such as will therefore thinke they worſhip the father,Vſe. and
haue him their God, muſt alſo doe honour to the ſonne, for
elſe they doe but make God their enemy, Ioh. 5. 23.
               That Ieſus our Sauiour is our annointed King,Doct. 2. Prieſt, and
Prophet. Our King here, verſ. 6. Our Prieſt, Pſal. 110. Hebr.

learne of him as the doctor of the Church.
               
                  Dauid in the ſpirit prophecied,Explanatiō. and foretold of this, and

we doe reade in Acts the fourth, that it is come to paſſe.
               
                  The enemies of Chriſt doe nothing which is not alreadie foreſeene
of God.
                  Doct. So the Apoſtles witnes, Act. 4. 24. and Chriſt
foretold alſo to his Diſciples, Mat. 10. 17. 18. 21. 22.
               To be comforted in this that God foreſeeth the attempts
of all his enemies, againſt his Sonne, and againſt his Church:
for by Chriſt muſt we alſo vnderſtand the bodie of Chriſt his
Church, called Chriſt, 1. Cor. 12. 12.
            
            
               VERSE .III.
               Let vs breake their bands,Text. and caſt their cords from vs.
               THus they encourage one another in their rebellious attempts:Paraphraſe.
let neither the Lord nor hisLuk. 19. 14. annoynted reigne

play the men, andIerem. 5. 5. ſhake off the yoke of ſuch ſeruitude, and
wholly reiect their gouernment.
               This verſe ſheweth what all theſe enemies doe eſpecially
aime at,Explanatiō. euen rebelliouſly to ſeeke their libertie: which teacheth,
               That the wicked are rebellious,Doct. and affect nothing ſo much as
lawleſſe libertie, to doe what themſelues like without all restraint
of lawes and gouernment. Pſal. 12. 4.
               Men muſt therefore take heed of affecting lawleſſe liberty,Vſe. 1.
leſt they be noted for ſuch wicked ones.Vſe. 2.
               
               Alſo Magiſtrates (ſeeing this their nature) ſhould labour
the more with wholſome lawes to containe them in obedience.
               
                  Let vs] The words of encouragement one to another,Explanatiō. to
ſtirre them vp to the worke. Teaching,
               That the wicked can animate and hearten one another in their
vngodly enterpriſes.Doct. 1. Sam. 4. 9. Pſal. 83. 4. 12. and 64. 5. Iere.
18. 18. Prou. 1. 11. and 7. 18.
               A reproofe of our ſluggiſhnes and want of loue to God,Vſe.
                  
when we haue no heart to exhort one another to well doing,
as we ought, Eſa. 2. 3. Pſal. 95. 1. Eccleſ. 12. 13.
               
                  Breake aſunder.
                  Explanatiō.] That is, aſſay to breake: for they cannot
indeed, but here ſhew their will, what they gladly would doe,
and what ignorantly they ſuppoſe they could doe, againſt
Dauid and againſt Chriſt. Nathac ſignifieth to vnfolde the
linkes, or twiſtings, and ſo to breake it in ſunder, Eccleſ. 4. 12.
Learne hence,
               That the wicked haue great purpoſes and reſolutions,Doct. 1. and haue
a minde to doe great matters, againſt God and his people. Pſal. 83.
4. 12. Eſa. 7. 56. 7. Exod. 1. 10. Nehe. 4. 7. 8. 11.
               We ſhould therfore when we ſee that they bring not their
purpoſes to paſſe,Vſe. acknowledge with thankes Gods prouidence
ouer vs, who preuenteth them, as we ſee in Nehe 4. 15.
Eſa. 7. 7.
               That they doe thinke that they are able to bring their thoughts
to paſſe,Doct. 2. euen againſt the Lord and his Chriſt. Act. 26. 9.Vſe.
               
               To behold hereby the proud conceit and preſumptuous
blindneſſe of mens wicked hearts, who think that they can do
things impoſſible, as Nimrod and his companie; the Iewes, and
heathen againſt Chriſtian religion.
               
                  Their bands] Bands,
                  Explanation the word muſar comming of jaſar, to
chaſtice, is properly diſcipline and correction, and ſo bands,
by which the vnruly are tamed: heere it is put for lawes. Hee
ſaith not his, but their bands, as the lawes of God publiſhed
by Dauid, or of Chriſt, by himſelfe and his Apoſtles; euen by
the Lord and his Miniſters, whom he vſeth in his rule and gouernment.
Teaching,
               That good lawes are as bands and cords for diſcipline,Doct. 1. to keepe
people in obedience to God, and to his ordinances.
               To receiue willingly good lawes,Vſe. as neceſſarie meanes, to
keepe the ill diſpoſed within the compaſſe of their duties.
               That rebellious hearts doe hold themſelues in bondage,Doct. 2. and as
priſoners in bonds, being made ſubiect to Gods owne lawes.
               This ſhould teach all to bewaile this corruption of our
hearts,Vſe. by which we count Gods eaſie yoke, and his commandements,
which are not grieuous, to be ſo burdenſome, & to

pray with Dauid that we may know and haue proofe of the
goodneſſe of his lawes, that we may loue them. Pſal. 119. 140
               That therefore ſuch will not haue Chriſt reigne ouer them,Doct. 3.
though they as Kings would reigne ouer others. Luk. 19. 14.
               This ſerueth to condemne in them their pride and iniuſtice,Vſe.
who deſiring to rule ouer others, cannot endure that
God himſelfe ſhould rule ouer them.
               
                  And caſt away their cords from vs.
                  Explanation.] The word gnaboth ſignifieth
a cord twiſted by foldings one in another, Exo. 28. 14.
Here is but either one thing expreſſed in diuers termes, or (as
ſome others thinke) by bands are lawes, by cords the diſcipline
and rule with theſe ſame lawes: ſo taking it we learne,
               That ſuch as cannot away with Gods word and lawes,Doct. doe cast
away, as it were in contempt, his gouernment, Luk. 19. 14.
               Therefore to bring men to a conformitie in Chriſts gouernment,Vſe.
they muſt firſt be brought to the obedience of his
word.
            
            
               VERSE IIII.
               But he that ſitteth in heauen ſhall laugh:Text. the Lord ſhall haue
them in deriſion.
               BVt let earthly Kings rage neuer ſo horribly, yet God who
is the King of heauen, andPſal. 9. 7. doth ſit for euer there as on
his throne, before whom the inhabitants of the earthIſai. 40. 22. are but
as graſhoppers, he doth ſet light of their impotent furie: and
as a valiant Champion, in ſtead of fearing, doth ſcorne his
feeble and ouermatched aduerſarie, ſo doth GodPſal. 37. 12. 13. and 59. 8. laugh at
their vaine attempts, and contemnes their weake oppoſition,
which cannot hurt, nor annoy him: and by fruſtrating their
deuices, ſhall propoſe them to the deriſion of others alſo.
               Here the Prophet doth ſhew,Explanation. why he held his and Chriſts
enemies to imagine a vaine thing, becauſe he had an eye vnto
God, whom he knew ſaw them well, and laughed at their follie:
teaching,Doct.
               
               That the true conſideration of Gods beholding and oppoſing the

wicked, and of his light account of them and their ſtrength, is that
which makes a godly man to iudge all their wicked enterpriſes to
be but vaine. Exod. 14. 13. 2. Chron. 20. 20.
               To make light of all the rage,Vſe. plots, power, and pohcies of
the wicked, let vs lift vp our eyes vnto God, and conſider
how he ſeeth, and laughs them to ſcorne: he being wiſer and
ſtronger then all his enemies. 1. Cor. 1. 25. Ioh. 10. 29.
               
                  He that ſitteth in the heauens.
                  Explanation.] Dauid oppoſeth onely the
Lord here to his and Chriſts enemies: to teach vs,
               That he hath ſtrength enough,Doct. that hath God on his ſide, though
neuer ſo many bee againſt him. Romans 8. 13. 2. Kings 6. 16.
2. Chron. 32. 7.
               If God bee on thy ſide,Vſe. care not what man can doe vnto
thee. Dauid oppoſeth him here as his comfort againſt all his
enemies: So Eſa. 8. 10.
               The words are a deſcription of God deliuered for the
Churches comfort againſt their enemies:Explanation. out of which words
we may learne,
               That God is in heauen.Doct. 1. 
                  Pſal. 11. 4. and 115. 1. 3. Eſa. 66. 1.

                  That therefore he ſeeth all thing's on earth.
                  Doct. 2. Pſal. 14. 2. and 11.
4. and 94. 7. Hebr. 4. 13. Ierem. 32. 19. elſe Dauid would not
alleage this for comfort.
               Comfort to the people of God,Vſe. that the Lord ſeeth his enemies,
and that wee haue our defender ouer our heads, Pſalme
102. 19. 29. and the auenger of our cauſe ouer their heads.
               That for this cauſe all the attempts of the wicked against him
are vaine;Doct. 3. whom he can from thence eaſily confound, and raine deſtruction
vpon them.Vſe 1. 
                  Pſal. 11. 4. 6. Gen. 7. 11. and 19. 24.
               The godly not to feare men,Vſe. 2. but to truſt in the Lord.
               Let the wicked feare and tremble, when they rebel againſt
Chriſt. The Lord is in heauen, conſider: Heb. 10. 31. He is aboue
all his enemies, Pſalm. 99. 2. and 97. 9. and beholdeth
what is done on earth. Pſal. 102. 19.
               
                  Shall laugh.
                  Explanatiō.] This is ſpoken of God, as elſewhere, Pro. 1. 26
Pſal. 59. 8. after the manner of men: to ſet out the follie of the

aduerſarie and their fooliſh attempts, the like reckoning hee
maketh of their great ſtirres, and power, and authoritie with
men. Iob. 41. 20.
               The proud and giantlike practiſes of all the wicked against
Chriſt (how dreadfull ſoeuer they ſeeme to the world) are in Gods
ſight ridiculous.Doct. 
                  Pſal. 37. 13. and 59. 8. and 33. 10. 11.
               Let vs eſteeme lightly of the power,Vſe. policie, and rage of
the wicked, and with Sion laugh them to ſcorne, Eſa. 37. 22.
for they cannot deſtroy the worke of God, Acts 5. 35—. For
Gods counſell ſhall ſtand for euer. Pſalm. 33. 11. Pro. 19. 21.
and 16. 1. and 21. 30. Iere. 10. 23.
               
                  The Lord] Here is expounded whom Dauid meant before
to ſit in heauen,Explanation. euen Adonaj the Lord, the vpholder and
pillar of his people, as the force of the word beareth. Teaching,
               That it is Adonaj the Lord Iehouah that hath his throne and
ſeate in heauen.Doct. Pſal. 11. 4. and 103. 19.
               Hereby to know the true God from all falſe gods:Vſe. 1. none
the God of heauen but he Ionah. 1.
               That alſo we hereby may vnderſtand for our comfort,Vſe 2. that
his rule and kingdome is ouer all the earth: therfore the Pſalmiſt
putteth theſe together, Pſal. 103. 19.
               
                  Shall haue them in deriſion.
                  Explanation.] The ſame thing ſeemeth twice
repeated, an vſuall thing in the Pſalmes to ſhew that it is moſt
certaine: yet indeede, as the words Shachach and lagnag are
diuers, ſo deriding is more then laughing, Pro. 1. 26. Pſal. 59.
9. Iob. 29. 24. This therefore may be referred to the heathen
and people, and the other to the Kings and Rulers.
               It is certaine that it is no hard matter with God,Doct. 1. to ouerthrow
the raging heathen, the murmuring multitude, the proud Kings
and politique Princes of the earth, gathering together againſt
him and his Chriſt. 2. Chron. 14. 11. and 20. 6. 1. Sam. 14. 6.
               To beleeue confidently this truth in the greateſt aduerſitie,Vſe.
remember the ſtorie of Senacheribs hoaſts ouerthrow:
Eſa. 37. 22. 29. 36. 38. & the Ethiopians huge armie, 2. Chro.
14. 9. 12. Sanballats policie preuented, Nehe. 4. 15. and the Aramites
ſecret counſell diſcloſed, 2. King. 6. 8. 9. 12.
               
                  
That it is alſo as ſure that he hath them in contempt,Doct. 2. and all
their power, he laugheth at the fooliſh multitude, but he verily
derideth as contemptible, the high and mighty aduerſaries,
Pſalm. 59. 8.
               Not to be deiected in ſpirit at mighty aduerſaries,Vſe. for the
greater they bee againſt the Lord, the more hee hath them in
contempt, yea and will make them a deriſion and laughing
ſtocke.
            
            
               VERSE .V.
               Then ſhall he ſpeake to them in his wrath,Text. and vexe them in
his ſore diſpleaſure.
               FOr howſoeuer for a while he may ſeeme ſcarcely to take
notice byPſal. 10. 1. ſuffering them to goe on in their practiſes,Paraphraſe. ſo
that they bleſſe themſelues in theirIbid .v. 3. & 13 imaginations, and ſay,
God regardeth not; yet when the appointed time commeth,
becauſe they would not heare his mild voyce inuiting them
to obedience; then as ifPſal. 18. 8. ſmoake went out of his noſtrills, ſo
will hee call to them by his wrathfull threatnings, and trouble
and perplexe them with his plagues, the tokens of his
anger.
               The Prophet hauing comforted the Church in the former
verſe,Explanation. one way, heere he continueth it, by foreſhewing how
the Lord ſitting in heauen, will deale with theſe enemies: he
will manifeſt his wrath againſt them.
               God will not onely laugh at and deride the folly of the wicked,Doct.
but in his wrath puniſh their wickedneſſe, and plague them that
hate thoſe, whom hee hath eſtabliſhed. Pſalme. 89. 20. 21.
22. 23.
               This may ſerue for terrour to the wicked,Vſe. and to humble
them, by conſidering that they are not onely contemned and
derided of God, but alſo muſt expect other puniſhments, and
iudgements from him, if they repent not.
               
                  Then.
                  Explanation] That is in the time appointed, not naming the time
certaine, but when the Lord ſhall thinke it fit, as he hath decreed,

after he hath beheld with patience their wicked endeuours,
and as it were ſported himſelfe with the apprehenſion
of their follies: then will hee ſuddenly puniſh them: teaching.
               
                  That there is verily a time of puniſhment for Chriſts enemies,
                  Doct.
                  albeit we know not the very ſeaſon; for Gods patient forbearing
of the wicked, will at length breake forth againſt his
enemies. Amos 8. 2. Luke 19. 43. Ezek. 12. 23. examples
in Eſay 13. and 15. and 21. and 25. 10.—12. and 26.

               Terrour to the vngodly practiſers againſt Chriſt and his
Church:Vſe. 1. let them looke for a change, Pſal. 50. 22.
               The Godly to learne patience, and to wait the Lords time,
not fretting againſt the wicked,Vſe 2. Pſal. 37. 1. the godly ſhall

9. and 26. 3. 5—8.
               
                  Shall he ſpeake vnto them in his wrath.
                  Explanatiō.] That is God ſhall
ſpeake, to wit, actually, declaring his anger againſt them: for
by ſpeaking here is his deed doing, called ſpeaking becauſe his
deeds are the manifeſtation of his will, as if hee ſpake vnto

               I will declare the decree,Text. that is, the Lord hath ſaid vnto me,
Thou art my ſonne, this day haue I begotten thee.
               NOw that alreadie ſpoken,Paraphraſe. one would thinke ſhould bee
ſufficient to moue any; and yet for their further conuiction,
that either being throughly reſolued they may obey, or
elſe be wholly left without all excuſe, I the ſame Dauid as a
Prophet of God, doe declare this his will vnto them: and if
they will beleeue it, behold Gods owne act and decree concerning
me: the tenour whereof is this: The Lord hathPſal. 132. 11. irreuocably
appointed, euen he hath ſaid it, and will not repent,
nor alter the thing that is gone out of his mouth. Thou O
Dauid art typically myPſal. 89. 26. 27 Ezek. 37. 24. ſonne, in as much as called and adopted
to the function and gouernment of my kingdome,
whom I did then as it were beget, when annoynting thee
with oyle,1. Sam. 16. 13. and putting my ſpirit vpon thee, and furniſhing
thee with gifts anſwerable to thy calling, I1. Sam. 10. 6. 9 changed thee into
another man, and put another heart into thee. And thou
O Chriſt art truly my ſonne,Matth. 3. 17. Luk. 1. 32. 35. Act. 13. 22. Rom. 1. 4. whom I begate eternally, yet
manifeſted thee then, when being miraculouſly conceiued,
through my power ouerſhadowing ye holy Virgin, I brought
thee my firſt begotten into the world, and raiſed thee from
the dead: whereby I declared thee mightily to be my ſonne.
               In this verſe the Prophet Dauid for himſelfe,Explanation. and alſo in the
perſon of Chriſt, plainly ſheweth, that what is done of them
both, was Gods decree, and therefore Dauid knew their attempts
againſt him and Chriſt were vaine.
               The regiment of Dauid,Doct. 1. and ſo of Chriſt, was fore-ordained of
the Lord, before they were eſtabliſhed actually. Pſal. 110.
               Not to thinke that Kings doe reigne at their pleaſure,Vſe. but
at Gods appointment: or that the Goſpell, by which Chriſt
reignes, comes by chance, but as God hath decreed.
               That therefore ſuch as then reſiſted Dauid and Chriſt,Doct. 2. now reſiſt
Gods decree in and vpon them.
               
                  
Therefore let ſuch reſiſters know, that as the Apoſtle ſaith,Vſe.
Rom. 13. 2. they muſt receiue to themſelues condemnation.
               I will declare the decree.
               Thus Dauid ſpeaks as a Teacher,Explanation. that he is willing to make
knowne Gods decree concerning him, to ſtay the enemies if
it be poſſible. Teaching,
               The true knowledge of Gods will in our ſtanding,Doct. is a ſtrong
bulwarke of defence, to oppoſe againſt all enemies: therefore D

               This being vnderſtood of Chriſt,Explanation. who alſo did declare
what he was, and what God had decreed concerning him, as
may be ſeene in all his diſputations againſt his aduerſaries;
we doe learne,

               Behold Chriſts loue and mercie,Vſe 2. who would not hide from

               Reproofe to ſuch,Vſe 3. firſt, as deſpiſe the calling of a Teacher:
ſecondly, as being Teachers in name, doe yet neglect to declare
Gods decree indeed.
               The Lord hath ſaid vnto me.
               Vnderſtanding it of Dauid firſt the type,Explanation. who doth ſhew
that this decree was made knowne to himſelfe,Doct. we learne,
               That it is not enough to haue the word of God to warrant the

action: but for a calling thereto in our place and ſtanding:
2. Chron. 35. 21. Heb. 4. 5. Ioſ. 1. 9. Iudg. 6. 14.
               To be able to applie the word of Gods decree truly and
rightly to our ſelues in our place and calling:Vſe. for that warranteth
a good action to our ſelues.
               Vnderſtanding theſe words of Chriſt,Explanatiō. we doe learne,
               
                  That God the Father is Chriſts Lord (according to his humanitie)
as he here acknowledgeth.Doct. 1.
               
               Therefore all Kings to acknowledge the ſame much more,Vſe.

Ioel. 1. 1. Act. 26. 22. 1. Cor. 11. 23.
               Thou art my ſonne, this day haue I begotten thee.
               
                  Dauid might in ſome ſort ſay thus as a type of Chriſt,Explanatiō. and
ſo aboue all Angels, and as a King, Pſal. 82. 6. and 89. 6. ſo in
Pſal. 89. 26. 27. and as a boly man, the Childe of God by adoption.

Pſal. 82. 6.
               Not to rebell againſt them,Vſe. 1. they be the children of the moſt

with a checke of conſcience, though it was without an euill
intendment.
               Let Ieſuited Traitors and murtherers of Kings take knowledge

Lords annointed: for who ſo prouoketh them to anger, ſinneth
againſt his owne ſoule: Pro. 20. 2.
               This is ſpoken of Chriſt as of the veritie,Explanation and this is one part
of that decree, which hee was to publiſh to the world at his
comming: by This day, may either bee vnderſtood the perpetuall
act of his eternall generation, or elſe his manifeſtation

thee to bee my begotten ſonne. From hence wee may
learne,
               
                  That Ieſus Chriſt was and is the very ſonne of God,
                  Doct. 1. and thus

ſonne, Heb. 1. 15. Ioh. 1. 14. Secondly, by his perfect ſanctification
and perſonall vnion of both natures, Luk. 1. 35. Ioh. 10. 36.
Thirdly, as King; ſo Pſal. 82. 6. Ioh. 10. 34.—36.
               To acknowledge this,Vſe. 1. Ioh. 1. with Peter, Mat. 16. Ioh. 6. 69.
and with the Centurion, and Martha, Ioh. 11. 27.

               To confirme our faith in this truth to our great comfort,Vſe.
when we be ſure that our Sauiour is the only ſonne of God.
               That this doctrine as a maine and moſt principall point,Doct. 3. was to

faith.Vſe.
               
               If wee conſider this as a reaſon,Explanation why God did annoint
Chriſt, and ſet him ouer his Church as King, viz. for that hee
was his only ſonne, we learne,
               That Ieſus Chriſt hath only right to be King ouer Gods people,Doct.
as the only ſonne and heire of his Father. Heb. 1.
               To yeeld therefore this high and ſoueraigne authority vnto
Chriſt alone,Vſe 1. as ſo ordained of his Father. Act. 2. 36.
               To hold it high treaſon to place any other ouer ye Church,Vſe. 2.
as the ſpirituall head and ſoueraigne betweene God and his
people, but him only.
               Theſe words are by the Apoſtle alleaged to proue Chriſts
Prieſthood,Explanatiō. Heb. 4. 4. and 5. 1.

of the earth ſhall be thy ſure poſſeſſion: all Kings ſhall worſhip
thee, all nations ſhall doe thee ſeruice.
               Theſe words are another part of the decree,Explanatiō. which the Prophet
foretels, Chriſt ſhould declare in his perſon to the people:
the former concerned his perſon, this his kingdome:
teaching,
               That another maine doctrine of Christs miniſtrie was,Doct. to publiſh
the nature and largeneſſe of his kingdome and dominion: of
which the Prophets foretold, Pſal. 72. 8. Eſa. 60. 3. and Chriſt
himſelfe ſpeaketh of alſo, Ioh. 12. 32.
               This doctrine muſt we take notice of,Vſe. and labour to vnderſtand
it: the error whereof did blind, and ſo doth to this day,
the miſerable Iewes, who ſtill looke for an earthly pompous
Meſſiah to exalt them againe in an outward earthlie
glorie.
               Aske of me.
               Here the words of God the Father are brought in,Explanatiō. to expreſſe
his power to giue, and readineſſe to inlarge Dauids and
Chriſts kingdome, as another reaſon to confound the enemies,
and to ſhew their attempts to be vaine.
               It is altogether vaine to oppoſe,Doct. and to keepe ſtraight, ſuch as
God is willing to make mightie, and to giue them large dominions.

                  See in Nabuchadnezzar▪ Cyrus, Alexander, the Romans, Dan.
2. 17.—44. Iere. 27. 5. 6. 8.
               This ſhould admoniſh all in ſtead of oppoſing themſelues,Vſe.
rather with quietnes to take vpon themſelues the yoke of
Kings and Princes, whom God hath eſtabliſhed, and as the
Prophet Ieremy exhorteth concerning Nabuchadnezzar▪
                   to
pray for them, and ſeeke their peace: for in their peace ſhall
themſelues haue peace, Iere. 27. and 29. 7.
               Theſe words are vſed to expreſſe Gods ſingular loue:Explanation for
ſo the ſpeech is vſed, when one would ſhew how much he is
well pleaſed with another. Mar. 6. 22. 1. King. 3. 5.
               Dauid was greatly beloued of the Lord,Doct. one after his owne
heart. Of this loue reade Pſal. 89. 2. Sam. 8. 14.
               Princes to follow the ſteps of Dauid,
                  Vſe. that they may be beloued
of the Lord, as all the Kings of Iudah were, that did
walke in his ſteps.
               Vnderſtand theſe words of the father,Explanation. ſo ſpoken to Chriſt,
as Chriſt act: for the fathers will to him ſhewes the ſonnes
act indeed.
               
                  Ieſus Chriſt is deerely beloued of his father,
                  Doct. and ſo well pleaſed
with him, as he can deny him nothing, Mat. 17. 5. Ioh. 11.

ſo great with the Father.
               And I ſhall giue thee the heathen for thine inheritance,Vſe. 3. and
the vttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.
               This is true in ſome ſort of Dauid,
                  Text. who did ſubdue all his
enemies round about him, as his ſtorie ſhewes, 2. Sam. 8. but
this is moſt fully accompliſhed in Chriſt, if wee doe conſider
the nature of his kingdome, which is ſpirituall, and therefore
ſpiritually diſcerned.
               
                  All the earth is in Gods hands to giue as he pleaſeth:

                  Doct. 2. 
                  and where
he liſteth: for his father biddeth him but aske and it ſhall be
giuen him, Ioh. 3. 8. Act. 16. 6. 7. 9.
               Exceeding comfort to the Church,
                     Ʋſe 1. that Chriſt is able to
reigne where he liſteth.
               To humble ſuch ouer whom Chriſt reigneth not:Vſe 2. for it is
becauſe he will not reigne ouer them.
               By heathen are meant all people excepting the Iewiſh nation,Explanation
the only people of God then viſibly.
               The Iewes did not only appertaine to Chriſts kingdome,Doct. 1 but the
Gentiles alſo, as appeareth this day, and in Eſa. the 60. and
Pſal. 72. 11. foretold.
               
               To confute the obſtinacie of the Iewes,Vſe. who cannot abide
this doctrine, Act. 22. though taught by the Prophets.

                  Doct. 1. 
                  yet is he the Lion of

               Be wiſe now therefore ye Kings,Text. be learned ye that are Iudges
of the earth.
               SVch is Gods counſell and decree concerning mee,Paraphraſe. which
in his mercy hee would make knowne, leaſt ignorance
ſhould miſlead you to your owne ouerthrow. Now
therefore O Kings and Iudges of the earth, hearken and conſider,
to you Ia ſpeake by name:Ier. 5. 5. you are Kings, and what
more odious to you then rebellion, and banding complotments
of your ſeditious ſubiects? you are Iudges, and what
more hainous then to contemne your iuſt decrees? doe not
then rebell againſt your Lord and King: withſtand not his
iuſt and ſtable decree: howſoeuer hitherto out of your fooliſh
and raſh Counſell, you haue oppoſed your ſelues, yet
bee wiſe at laſt and obey. It is not your greatneſſe that can
ſecure you from deſtruction, nor exempt you from obedience:
as you were chiefe in oppoſition, ſo be you firſt in ſubmiſſion,
and yeelding your ſelues plyant, that the more flexible
multitude may follow you.
               Now the Pſalmiſt maketh the vſe of this his former doctrine,Explanation
exhorting the mightieſt wel to conſider of that which
hath beene ſaid, and to become obedient, which is the third
and laſt part of this Pſalme.
               The drift of all faithfull teachers,Doct. is by their doctrine to bring
men in obedience to Chriſt: Dauids end heere: Peter Acts. 2.
36. 38. ſo S. Paul in all his Epiſtles concluding euer with
exhortations to practiſe.
               
               In teaching to exhort to obedience as the ſcope of our
doctrine:Vſe. without obedience, neither hearing, Rom. 2. Iam.
1. 22. nor knowledge. 1. Iohn 2. 4. nor faith, Iam. 2. 17. nor
calling on God, Eſa. 1. Mat. 7. 21. nor Preaching, Mat. 7. 23.
nor faſting, Eſa. 58. nor loue, 1. Iohn 5. 2. nor comming to
Church,
                  Explanatiō. Eſa. 1. Ier. 7. nor baptiſm, 1. Cor. 7. auaileth any thing.
               Albeit that Dauid knew that ſome enemies of Chriſt ſhuld

periſh through their obſtinacy, as alſo many of his, for that
they would ſtand out againſt him: yet not knowing who
would repent, hee offers meanes to them heere to reclaime
them.
               That hopefull charity maketh Gods true meſſengers to ſpeake
to moſt wicked men,Doct. to gaine (if it be Gods will) ſome of them.
So Chriſt to the Scribes and Phariſes: ſo the Apoſtles, Act. 8.
22. and 13. 46. and 7. 2. 51.
               Miniſters to haue this charitable hope,Vſe. that thereby they
may doe as Dauid, as Chriſt, and his Apoſtles did, euen to
preach to, and exhort the worſt, to ſee if God at any time wil
giue them repentance, 2. Tim. 2. 25.
               
                  And now.
                  Explanation] Vau gnattah, the time is noted, to ſhew when
he would haue them to repent, euen now without delay.
               A faithfull teacher wiſheth the preſent and speedy conuerſion
of the people,Doct. 1. to whom hee ſpeaketh. Coloſ. 3. 8. Pſalme 95.

               To be thus earneſtly affected for the peoples ſaluation,Vſe. as
God is. Pſal. 95. Heb. 3. Col. 3. 8.
               Repentance is not to be deferred off,Doct. 2. but when the meanes is
offered, then is the time. Act. 17. 30. 2. Cor. 6. 2. Heb. 3. 7.
               Not to put it off from day to day:Vſe. for if the day of wrath
come, then repentance will not auaile vs, to moue vs to repent
and conſider. Luke. 12. 20. and 17. 27. 1. Theſſal. 5. 3.
Ier. 13. 23. Eccleſ. 12. 1. Pro. 1. 28. Pſal. 18. 26.
               
                  Be wiſe.
                  Explanatiō.] The verbe ſhacal is to doe conſiderately, Dauid
heere ſheweth what they doe want, and ſo what it is that
makes them not yeelde to Chriſt, euen want of knowledge
and true wiſedome.
               The ignorance of Chriſt maketh naturall men enemies vnto
him,Doct. 1. 1. Cor. 2. 8. Acts 3. 17. Luke 23. 34.
               To learne to know Chriſt aright,Vſe. to doe this, learne the
parts of Gods decree heere, which Dauid declares touching
his perſon, kingdome and power ouer his enemies, which
Dauid held ſufficient to teach, and to bring thereby theſe to
Chriſts obedience.Doct. 2.
               
               
                  That they are not truely wiſe (be they neuer ſo great) that

are not obedient vnto Chriſt, yea S. Paul held himſelfe madde,
while hee was raging againſt poore Chriſtians, Acts 26. 11.
               To hold the wiſeſt of the world fooles and mad,Vſe. ſo long
as they be againſt Chriſt.
               In that Dauid heere exhorts to wiſedome,Explanatiō. before ſeruice
in the next verſe, he would teach vs,
               
                  That knowledge neceſſarily muſt be had,
                  Doct. 
                  before we can obey,
therefore Dauid asketh knowledge, and then promiſeth obedience,

               To become obedient,Vſe 1. get knowledge, Prou. 4. 5. Eph. 5.
17. Col. 3. 16. without which we cannot beleeue, Rom. 10.
we can haue no conſcience of our duety.
               This is againſt our aduerſaries,Vſe. 2. who make ignorance the
mother of deuotion, contrary to Mat. 22. 29. and 5. 39.
               
                  O ye Kings.
                  Explanation.] To theſe hee firſt doth ſpeake, and not to the
multitude, albeit he ſpake of them, ver. 1. as enemies, not in
contempt, or careleſneſſe of their ſaluation, but for that they
are Iedde by the mighty, and therfore to theſe he firſt turues
his ſpeech.
               
                  It is a cheefe point of wiſedome in the furtherance of Chriſts
kingdome,
                  Doct. 1. 
                  to winne firſt the mighty. The godlineſſe of an Hezechias
or Ioſias maketh all the people to ſeeke the Lord, ſo
one Conſtantine maketh a Chriſtian world.
               To vſe the beſt meanes for the conuerſiō of the mighty,Vſe. &
to pray heartily vnto God to turne the hearts of ſuch, that
by their examples many may be prouoked vnto well-doing.

places and wealth.
               
                  Be inſtructed.
                  Explanation.] As ſome read, be ye learned, Iaſar properly
ſignifieth to be chaſtified, but yet as wel with words, Pro. 29.
19. Pſ. 39. 11. as rods, 1. King. 12. 2. Chr. 10. 11. 14. ſo it

                  Ye Iudges of the earth.
                  Explanation.] Here are meant thoſe that exerciſe
authoritie vnder Princes, called before Rulers, heere Iudges.
Shophet is one, that knoweth to iudge betweene cauſe and
cauſe for the defence of the innocent, and puniſhment of the
offenders: theſe he exhorts with Kings, whom he calles Iudges
of the earth, as he did Kings before, verſ. 2. to teach,
               That it is as neceſſary for Rulers and Iudges to learne this wiſdome,Doct. 1.
with their Kings, as for Kings themſelues; elſe Kings can
doe little, where their Princes and Magiſtrates be wicked.
               If Kings become religious,Vſe. let them take to them ſuch as
are alſo religious. It is true, Kings ſhould be firſt: but then
next, their Nobles and Rulers; elſe Ioaſh will not continue religious,
if Iehoiadah be dead, and wicked Princes remaine about
him.
               That as they be Kings of the earth,Doct. 2. ſo alſo Iudges of the earth,
all earthly which are not in ſubiection to Chriſt.
               Such as be not ſubiect to Chriſt,Vſe. let them know themſelues
to bee but earthly, and therefore muſt pray vnto the Lord to
be framed of a better mould, that as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,
Rom. 6. 17. they may obey from the heart, the forme of the
doctrine whereunto the word of God doth call them.
            
            
               VERSE .XI.
               Serue the Lord in feare,Text. and reioyce in trembling.
               NEither doe I call you to my ſeruitude,Paraphraſe. but Gods ſeruice:
Pſal. 45. 11. he is your Lord God, and worſhip you him. And as for

this, did you well conſider, it is no matter of ſorrow, but rather
of ioy,Pſal. 60. 8. to bee his ſeruants, who ruleth onely for your
peace: reioyce therefore and triumph: the Lord reigneth,Pſal. 97. 1. be
you glad thereof: and yet forget not your ſelues to bee ſubiectsHeb. 12. 28. Pſal. 4. 4. Phil. 2. 12.:
mixe the ioy of your weale, with the reuerence of his
maieſtie, and ſo ſtand in awe that you ſinne not.
               
                  Serue the Lord] Here is ſhewed,Explanation whereto they muſt be wiſe,
and what this their wiſedome is, euen to doe ſeruice to the
Lord: the word gnabad is to ſerue as a ſeruant to his Lord.
Gen. 29. 18.
               The wiſedome and learning that God requires,Doct. 1 is to do him ſeruice:
this he accounts wiſedome, Deut. 4. 6. Pſalme 111. 10.
Matth. 7. 24.
               Not to thinke that thou haſt attained true wiſedome and
learning in profeſſion of Chriſt,Vſe. till thou doe him ſeruice:
1. Ioh. 2. 4. Rom. 2. 13. Luk. 12. 47. Iam. 1. 22.
               That Kings and Princes are not to liue as they liſt,Doct. 2. but in ſubiection
vnto Chriſt. Eſa. 60. 12. Pſal. 72. 10. 11.
               To ſquare their liues to the rule of Chriſts will as his true
ſeruants,Vſe. to whom they alſo, with the meaneſt, are to yeeld a
ſtrict account.
               The Pſalmiſt doth not will them to caſt off their authoritie,Explanation.
but calles them Kings and Rulers ſo to ſerue him. Learne,
               That Chriſts kingdome is not againſt the earthly dominion of
Princes,Doct. 1. to ouerthrow it, as Herod dreamed, Mat. 2. for his kingdome
is not of this world. Ioh. 18. 36.
               Let not Princes therefore feare to entertaine Chriſt,Vſe. and to
become his ſubiects: hereby they doe nothing at al diminiſh
their earthly glorie, but ſhal by thus doing liue, more ſecurely
vnder Gods protection.
               That men may doe ſeruice to God,Doct. 2. and yet be Kings and Gouernours,
as zealous Dauid, godly Ioſias and other holy Kings in
Iudah.
               
               Againſt the fooliſh practiſes of ſuch as gaue ouer their rule,
in conceit to ſerue God better: when they could haue honored
Chriſt no way more, then in vſing their high authoritie
to Chriſts ſeruice.
               
                  
                  With feare.
                  Explanation] The manner of this ſeruice here is noted Ieraah
is a reuerend awe, commended to be the beginning of wiſdome,
Pro. 1. 7. this is required in Chriſts ſeruice.
               
                  Reuerend feare is a ſpeciall grace in Gods ſeruice,
                  Doct. 1. Pet. 2. 17.
Heb. 12. 28. Mat. 4. 10. with Deut. 10. 20. and 6. 13. Eſa. 8. 13.
Eccleſ. 12. 13. Mat. 1. 6.
               To feare the Lord,
                     Ʋſe 1. and ſhake off carnall ſecuritie in our
profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, as alſo our pride, both which are
contrary to true feare.
               Reproofe to the proud-ones,Vſe. 2. to al that liue in a worldly ſecuritie,
vnder the profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, though they be
neuer ſo mightie. Gen. 42. 18.
               
                  And reioyce.
                  Explanatiō.] The word gil, is to reioyce internally: ſo it
makes him skip for ioy, this is added to feare, and now is the
time of Kings, and Princes, and others to reioyce when they
bee vnder Chriſts obedience, for now the Prophet exhorts
them to ioy.
               There is no cauſe of true ioy to Kings or Princes,Doct. 1. or any other,
till they haue been wiſe, learned Chriſt, and put themſelues into his
ſeruice, with feare and reuerence, Luk. 15. 23.
               To be a partaker of true ioy,Vſe. become a true Chriſtian: for
ſuch may reioyce. Luk. 10. 20. Pſal. 32. 11. Phil. 4. 4. Eſa. 51. 3.
and 54. 1. and Zeph. 3. 14—.
               
                  So is our ſeruice to Chriſt mixt with feare,
                  Doct. 2. 
                  as alſo there is true
cauſe of ioy, 1. Pet. 1. 8. Eſa. 9. 3. and libertie to reioyce, Pſal. 122.
1. and 68. 3. and 106. 5. Iere. 9. 24. Luk. 10. 20. and it is a voluntarie
and not a coacted ſeruice. Pſalme 110. 3. Eſa. 2. 3.
Mich. 4. 2.
               Not to thinke Chriſtianitie to bee a heauie,Vſe 1. lumpiſh and
comfortleſſe ſadneſſe, but that therein is true ioy: and that it
is lawfull for the godly to expreſſe alſo their ioy in lawfull
things outwardly. Deut. 12. 18. Nehem. 8. 10.—12.
               To labour to feele this true ioy in Chriſts ſeruice.Vſe 2. 1. Cor. 1.
31. 2. Cor. 10. 17.
               
                  With trembling.
                  Explanation.] With feare is added reioycing, and now to
this trembling, as if he had ſaid, So ſerue with feare, as yet ſerue
him with cheerefulnes, loue and delight, not conſtrained, and

ſo be merrie and glad, that yet you degenerate not into carnall
ſecuritie and neglect of him.
               
                  God affoordeth ioy vnto his people,
                  Doct. 
                  and willeth them to reioyce,
yet ſo, as he will not haue it breake out into licentious libertie, Galath.
5. 13. 1. Pet. 2. 16. S. Pauls example for this, who was
full of ioy vpon ſeuerall occaſions; yet he beat downe his bodie,
1. Cor. 9. 29.
               Reproofe to ſuch as turne the grace of God into wantonnes,Vſe.
when wee are exhorted to worke out our ſaluation with
feare and trembling. Chriſtian religion is not an idle, ſecure,
and wanton profeſſion, but a ſeruice, to bee performed with
feare and trembling. Phil. 2. 12. Heb. 12. 38. Hab. 2. 4.
            
            
               VERSE .XII.
               Kiſſe the ſonne leſt he be angrie,Text. and ye periſh in the way, if his
wrath ſhall ſuddenly burne: bleſſed are all they that trust in
him.
               ANd finally,Paraphraſe. as you haue banded your ſelues, not onely againſt
the Lord, but his Chriſt too: ſo muſt you not
only ſerue him, but his Sonne and Annointed alſo: he is your
King, and Prince of your ſaluationIoh. 5. 23.. Doe you homage and
fealtie vnto him, in ſubmitting your ſelues to his lawes and
word: otherwiſe know, that you ſhall but prouoke him to
anger,Iere. 21. 12. and kindle his wrath, the leaſt ſparke whereof ſhall
be ſufficient to deſtroy you, euen in the middeſt of your intendments
before you can effect them: yea rather while you
haue time, before his whole diſpleaſure like a fierie tempeſt ariſe
againſt you, hearken and obey, and by a ſincere faith beleeue
in him, becauſe all ſuch, and they only, are truly happie
who truſt in him.
               
                  Kiſſe.
                  Explanation.] The Pſalmiſt ſtill continueth his exhortation to vrge
obedience to the Lord. Naſach to kiſſe, is put for reuerence
and high eſtimation, Pro. 24. 26. for loue and affection, Iere.
29. 13. and for obedience, Gen. 41. 40. ſo the word is in the
Hebrew, and all may well be here meant.
               
                  
The ſeruice due to Chriſt,Doct. is a reuerend obedience, with an high
eſtimation of him in loue, Heb. 12. 28. Phil. 3. 8. Ioh. 21. 15.
               To do him all homage,Vſe. 1. being obedient in a reuerend loue,
and high eſteeme of his perſon, as our dread Soueraigne, all
the Kings and Princes of the earth owe this vnto him.
               This reproueth thoſe that profeſſe him,Vſe 2. but will doe him
no ſeruice; or if they doe ſeruice, it is without that reuerence
and due eſteeme, which is required of them.
               
                  The ſonne.
                  Explanation.] Dauid before vrging ſeruice to the Lord, now
applieth it to the Sonne: thereby teaching,
               That God is then ſerued when his Sonne is acknowledged,Doct. and
obeyed as Lord and King, Ioh. 5. 23. 1. Ioh. 2. 22. 23. 1. Ioh. 5. 1.
               This condemneth all ſeruice of Turkes,Vſe. Iewes, and Heathen,
which honour not Chriſt as the Sonne of God, and as
Lord and King, Iohn 3. 18. 1. Ioh. 5. 12. for Chriſt is God.
Rom. 9. 5. one with the Father, Ioh. 17.
               
                  Dauid might haue ſaid,Explanation kiſſe the King, as he was ordained
of God, verſ. 5. but here he ſets downe the title of Sonne: to
learne,
               That the chiefeſt honour to Chriſt is to be accounted the ſonne
of God:Doct. in this title the Father proclaimes him, Mat. 3. and 17.
the Apoſtles confeſſe him, Mat. 16. 16.
               To hold and acknowledge this chiefly,Vſe. that Ieſus Chriſt is
the Sonne of God, the ſcope of the Goſpell, Ioh. 20. 31.
               
                  Leſt he be angrie.
                  Explanation] By he is meant God the Father: Dauid
ſaith not leſt, as Eue did, Geneſ. 3. to make a peraduenture of
his wrath, but to ſhew that God is patient, if men prouoke
him not to wrath. The word Anaph to be angrie, ſignifieth
to be angrie as one in a rage.
               
               
                  That God the Father is he that is prouoked to wrath,
                  Doct. 
                  when his
Sonne is not obeyed. Therefore doth Chriſt on the Croſſe intreate
his Father to forgiue his enemies, Luk. 23. 34.
               To feare the wrath of God the Father in contemning his
Sonne.Vſe. Behold the Iewes. Reade Deut. 18. 19. Hebr. 12. 25.
The conſideration hereof, ſhould make men obey the ſonne:
it is Dauids argument here.
               
                  If the word he be referred to the ſonne,
                  Explanation 
                  we may learne,
                  
That though Chriſt be meeke as a lambe,Doct. yet may hee be prouoked
to fierce wrath by obſtinate contempt of his perſon, and can be
very angrie. See Mark. 3. 5. Reuel. 2. 16. 22. 23. and 3. 16. and
6. 16. Luk. 19. 27.
               Conſider this,Vſe. that Chriſt Ieſus can be angrie, againſt ſuch
as will not yeeld him obedience, that wee may ſubiect our
ſelues vnto him, leſt we prouoke him to wrath, who one day
will render vengeance to his enemies▪ 2. Theſſ. 1. 7. 8. Luk. 19.
27. Mat. 27.
               And ye periſh in (or from) the right way.
               That is,Explanation. 
                  ye which will not doe him homage, periſh, that is,
be taken away, deſtroyed, in, or from the way, that is, ſuddenly,
whileſt you are in your way, courſe, and practiſe againſt
him.
               That the iust anger of God and Chriſt againſt their enemies
bringeth deſtruction.Doct. 1. Iudg. 2. 14. 15.
               Doe not therefore offend him,Vſe. nor prouoke him to anger,
but meere him in all humilitie. Amos 4. 12.
               That destruction ſhall come vpon the wicked,Doct. 2. euen in their way,
orPro. 5. 22. and 11. 5. Iere. 4. 18. and 2. 19. from their courſe, when they leaſt thinke vpon it they ſhall be
taken away. Mat. 24. 5. 1. Theſſ. 5. 3.
               Be warned and ſhake off all ſecuritie in ſinning againſt
God:Vſe. leſt that day come vpon you vnawares.
               
                  When his wrath is kindled but a little.
                  Explanation.] The word bagnar, here
tranſlated his wrath kindled, is properly to burne as fire, and
metaphorically to bee inflamed with anger, like fire deſtroying
(without mercie) the parties with whom ſuch a one is angrie,
Eſter 1. 12. like the rage of Nabuchadnezzar, Daniel 3.
13. 19.
               The leaſt degree of Gods wrath is like burning fire to deſtroy
and deuoure vp his enemies,Doct. 
                  Iere. 21. 12.
               Tremble at the conſideration hereof when by ſinne we do

vs. Eſai. 9. 18.
               Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.
               A comfortable ſentence to the Church of Chriſt as a motiue
to hold them conſtant to him,Explanatiō. which haue betaken themſelues

to his protection: a fit concluſion to this euangelicall
Pſalme: whence we may learne,
               
                  That Chriſt can and doth make His bleſſed:
                  Doct. 1. Reuel. 2. 7. 11.
17. 27. 28. and 3. 5. 12. 21. Ioh. 10. 28. Gen. 22. 18. Gal. 3. 14.
               Haue recourſe vnto Chriſt,Vſe. if we would be bleſſed: for elſe
are we accurſed and ſubiect to the fierie wrath of God.
               That all that are Christs without exception are bleſſed,Doct. 2. they be
the bleſſed companie, Mat. 25. 34.
               To account ſuch as bee Chriſts,Vſe 1. though neuer ſo meane, to
be bleſſed ones.
               Singular comfort that thou art a true Chriſtian,Vſe. 2. and ſo
bleſſed from that burning diſpleaſure of God, by thy Sauiour
Chriſt Ieſus.
               That all theſe bleſſed,Doct. 3. are ſo by faith, and putting their truſt in
him. Ioh. 3. 16. 36. and 6. 40. 47. and 7. 38. and 11. 25.
               To haue our faith and affiance in him:Vſe. the word Chaſah
is to haue a firme aſſurance of protection, and to haue recourſe
to him, as to a place of refuge, as indeed the Lord is to
His. Eſa. 25. 4.
               To conclude,Explanatiō. though Dauid in the former doctrinall part
of the Pſalme ſpake to ye enemies, as well of his, as of Chriſts:
yet when he makes his exhortation, he vrgeth them to obey
the Lord, and to yeeld him ſeruice, thereby, being a King, and
a Prophet, he teacheth,
               That in claiming our right,Doct. the drift and concluſion both of
Kings and Prophets ſhould bee, to bring all in obedience to the
Lord.
               All Kings and Prophets aime at this,Vſe. in ſtanding vpon your
dignities and callings.
            
         
         
            
            The third Pſalme.
            
               THE ARGVMENT.
               IN this Pſalme (beeing mixt) Dauid now driuen out of his
kingdome by Abſolom, doth complaine to God of the number
and grieuouſneſſe of his enemies, not onely breaking forth into
an open inſurrection againſt him, but alſo with blasphemies against
God, and contumelies againſt himſelfe, inſulting ouer
him, as a man vtterly forſaken and forlorne. Yet neuertheleſſe
he gathereth comfort to himſelfe from Gods defence, which hee
aſſureth himſelfe of, from the experience that hee formerly had
of his helpe at hand, when he called vpon him. Thus being confirmed,
he ſheweth his ſecurity and confidence againſt the greateſt
dangers, and that through Gods protection, which hee moſt
earneſtly craueth, aſcribing the praiſe of his deliuerance to him
alone.
            
            
               The vſe and profit of this Pſalme.
               THis Pſalme is of great vſe and profit to the Church, eſpecially
to ſuch as be vnder the Croſſe and rod of God; for
here a man may ſee as in a glaſſe, by Dauids behauiour, what
he is to do, to whom to flye, to whom to complaine, how to
be comforted in ſuch trouble and diſtreſſe, how to ſhake off
all worldly feare, and in whom to truſt; laſtly how to be exerciſed
in ſo great perill, and to whom to aſcribe the glory
of deliuerance and victory.
            
            
               
               The reſolution of this Pſalme.

               The generall obſeruations.
               VVHen Dauid had beene diuers yeares ſetled in his
kingdom peaceably, it pleaſed God after his fearfull
fall, to exerciſe him a little while with a ſore temptation, with
a ſtormy tempeſt of rebellion by his own ſon, and many of his
hollow-harted ſubiects, for the triall of his faith and patience;
vpon which occaſion, as the title ſheweth, hee penned
this Pſalme for the inſtruction of Gods Church, whence wee
may learne .I. That in Gods mercy, a Dauids afflictions, that
is, a godly mans troubles turne to the Churches profit, and
make good for the ſame: for heereby haue wee this and many
other Pſalmes, the hiſtory of Iob, the ſong of Hezekiah,
&c .II. That the beſt ſhall not want their trialls, nor the
greateſt (ſometime) their troubles. III. That nothing can
make a faithfull man ſtart backe from cleauing faſt to God,
neither words nor deeds,Pſalm. 112. 7. 8. as heere we ſee, verſ. 1. 2. 3. and the
ſame is confirmed in Iob, who by afflictions, and the words
of his wife & friends, yet truſted in God: for true faith ſurmounts
all difficulties and diſtreſſes whatſoeuer. IV. That
Gods protection giueth ſufficient ſecurity, for if God bee
with vs,Rom. 8. 31. none can bee againſt vs. V. And laſtly, they that
truſt in God, come who will, or how many ſoeuer againſt
them, ſhall in the end haue cauſe to praiſe him, for his mercy
in their ſafety from all enemies: for the eyes of the Lord behold
all the earth,
                  2. Chron. 16. 9. 
                  to ſhew himſelfe ſtrong with them that are of a perfect
hart towards him.
               
            
            
               
               Of the Title.
               
                  THis is the firſt Pſalme that hath a title, the titles
are diuers in ſundry Pſalmes, and ſome of them
make very much to the vnderſtanding of the
Pſalme, containing briefly the argument of it,
as this title doth, and do ſhew who is the penman,
and vpon what occaſion penned, and when it was indited:
the variety may be obſerued in other places, as we ſhal
come heereafter vnto them, thus much of this in generall for
the preſent.
               
                  A Pſalm.
                  Explanation.] The Apoſtle mentioneth three kinds of ſongs,
Epheſ. 5. 19. ſo are there in this booke Tehillah, in Greeke

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a hymne or praiſe; Shir 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a ſong or laye; and heere this
mizmor 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , it commeth of zamar, to prune or cut off ſuperfluous
twigs, and noteth, that this kinde is an artificially
framed ſong, in a certaine full number of words and meaſure,
ſuperfluous words being cut away. Note hence,
               
                  That it is lawfull to vſe ſweet ſongs artificially modulated,
                  Doct.
                  (the ditty being holy and heauenly) as well as other, the Apoſtle
giues liberty in all, Eph. 5. 19. ſo it be in the heart, and vnto
the Lord, with vnderſtanding and to edification.
               To vſe heerein our Chriſtian liberty,Vſe. ſo it be holy as becommeth
true godlineſſe, and men endued with grace.
               
                  Of Dauid.
                  Explanation.] Or to Dauid, for to or of may bee both one,
the Hebrew ſpeech vſeth theſe indifferently, as the learned in
that tongue affirme, as appeareth plainely in the title of the
Pſalme, 120. & 121. where Hammagnaloth, and Pammagnaloth,
are made one; ſo in Greeke we do read 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Mar.
2. 18. and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . So this ſhewes it was a Pſalme of Dauid
                  
which he did penne, and a Pſalme to Dauid for his owne
inſtruction, as well as for others: teaching,
               That it is nothing derogatory to the Maieſty of Regall authority,Doct. 1.
for Kings with all Art and skill, to compoſe and to bee
cunning in Poems; Dauid a renowned King, wiſe and valiant,
was heerein excellent, ſo Moſes, Pſal. 90. and Salomon,
as Canticles ſhew, and alſo Hezechiah, Eſay. 38. 9.
               To eſteeme of this excellent gift,Vſe. & none to vilifie or baſely
account thereof: it was an excellent gift in the Primitiue
Church, 1. Corinth. 14. 26. The abuſe onely maketh it contemptible;
there is profitable and ſingular vſe to bee made
thereof.
               That Dauid imployed this excellent gift to the publike good
of the Church:Doct. 2. yet ſo a Pſalme of Dauid for others, as it was
alſo to Dauid, for his owne benefit.
               To vſe our gifts to the Churches edification;Vſe. therein excell,
1. Cor. 14. 12. but yet ſo be a teacher vnto others, as we may
alſo profit our ſelues, ſpeake to others and to our ſelues, Eph.
5. 19. that while we preach vnto others, we our ſelues be not
reprooued, 1. Cor. 9. 27.
               
                  When he fled.
                  Explanation] Bebarhu in flying or auoyding him: now
did he penne this Pſalme, ſhewing,
               
                  That croſſes and afflictions (though grieuous) hinder not the
piety and deuotion of Gods children,
                  Doct. 
                  but rather yeeld matter &
further occaſion thereof, Pſalm. 7. 2. Sam. 16. 17. Pſalm. 52.
1. Sam. 22. 9. there be many Pſalmes penned vpon ſuch occaſion,
for God by troubles teacheth his people many things,
which elſe they would neuer practiſe.
               To bleſſe God that giueth ſuch wiſedome and grace vnto
his Children,Vſe. 1. to make ſo happy gaine to themſelues, and to
others, of their troubles.
               To pray for this wiſedome and grace,Vſe 2. that we may be able
to make this holy vſe of afflictions.
               A condemnation to ſuch as by croſſes and afflictions are
driuen from all deuotion,Vſe. 3. and through impatience and want
of faith doe forſake goodneſſe.
               
                  Dauid was a moſt ſtout champion,Explanation and very valiant, and

yet heere hee is noted to flye. A valiant man, ſometime
(without any diſgrace to him) may flye to auoid imminent
and moſt certaine perill of death to him and his, as Dauid
doth heere, 2 Sam. 15. 13. 14.
               Not to hold it a diſgrace in ſuch a caſe to flye:Vſe. neither impute
it to any for cowardlineſſe: but rather to iudge the deſperate
hazard foole-hardlineſſe, and ſuch mad aduenturers (if
they dye) little leſſe then ſelfe-murtherers.
               
                  From the face of his ſonne.
                  Explanation.] From the face, is from his perſon,
ſo taken, Leuit. 19. 15. or from his wrath and ferity. Gen.
32. 20. becauſe the ſigne of wrath appeareth in the face: here
is a ſonnes wrath kindled ſo againſt the Father (yet moſt vniuſtly)
as he dares not abide his preſence.
               Good & godly parents may haue most leaud children,Doct. 1. Adam
a Caine, Abraham an Iſhmael, Iſaac an Eſau, &c.
               
               To make men know that grace is not by nature,
                  Vſe. 
                  example,
or education: but by the holy ghoſt, and therefore to pray
God for them.
               
                  That the godly may haue enemies ariſing out of their owne
bowells,

Chriſt foretells, Mat. 10. 35. 36.

hold it ſtrange.
               This riſing of Dauids ſonne againſt him,Explanation. came as God
foretold, to puniſh his adultery and murther, 2 Sam. 12. 11.
and 16. 22. thus the Lord raiſeth vp this inſtrument, and heauily
doth chaſtiſe Dauids great offence, by which he had cauſed
Gods name to be blaſphemed, 2. Sam. 12. 14.
               God will and may raiſe vp what inſtruments hee pleaſeth to
puniſh offenders,Doct. 1. 
                  thus he raiſed Hadad, Reizen, and Ieroboam
againſt Salomon, 1. King. 11. 14. 23. 26. and heere the ſonne
againſt the Father, 2. Sam. 12. 11.
               Learne therefore to feare the Lord,Vſe. that wee ſinne not againſt
him: for he hath his inſtruments ſuch as hee will, and
where he pleaſeth to raiſe them vp againſt vs, if we prouoke
him to wrath.
               
                  Great ſinnes receiue heauy chaſtiſements,
                  Doct. 2. (a Dauid heere

feeleth it) if we doe conſider his ſinnes, and heare his ſonnes
act of rebellion,Vſe. withall the circumſtances of both.
               As thou doſt ſinne, ſo looke for puniſhment, behold Iezabels
ſinnes and puniſhment, 1. King. 21. 23. 2. Kings. 9. 33.
ſo Iehoram, 2. Chron. 21. 4. 14. 17. 18. 19. terrible vengeance
for their execrable wickedneſſes.
               It may ſeeme very ſtrange,Explanation. that Dauid a valiant man, who
would ſo often be nigh to Saul, and come to ſpeake to him,
when he came with an hoaſt againſt him. 1. Sam. 24. 9. and
26. and yet dare not abide his ſonnes comming: but the reaſon
was, that Dauid ſaw him ſo vnnaturall, as hee knew hee
would be moſt cruell, heereby teaching,
               That none may bee held more ſauage and mercileſly cruell,Doct.
then ſuch as haue loſt the light and inſtinct of nature: ſee this
in Caine to Abell, Gen. 4. Iehoram againſt his brethren, 2.
Chron. 21. 4. Abimelech. Iudg. 9. 5.
               To ſuſpect the worſt of theſe inhumane monſters,Vſe 1. except
the Lord bridle their fury. Gen. 32. 11.
               To take heed that we become not vnnaturall,Vſe 2. for then we
will turne Tygres, and deuouring beaſts, without ſparing the
neereſt and deereſt of our bloud.
               
                  Abſalom.
                  Explanatiō.] This is the Rebell and Conſpirator, euen Abſolom
Dauids darling, the ſonne of a King, and of a Kings
daughter, 2. Sam. 3. 3. moſt comely, cap. 14. 25. and well
brought vp, 1. Chron. 27. 32. Prou. 4. 3. 4. and 31. 1. beloued
of his Father, 2. Sam. 18. 5. 33. pardoned of his great
offence. 2. Sam. 13. and 14. allowed large maintainance, 2.
Sam. 15. 1. yet now ſeeketh his fathers death.

                  Doct. 1.
                  from them often ariſeth the greateſt miſchiefe. Example here:

cap. 24. 21.
               Not to expect alwaies an anſwerable recompence to thy
goodnes:Vſe. but rather (ſuch is mans ingratitude) to receiue

ſometimes euill for good: as Dauid complaineth in the Pſal.
35. 12—16. and 38. 20. and 59. 3. And our Sauiour who did
good and no euill, found the people moſt vngratefull, and
wickedly bent againſt him.
               It is not nobleneſſe of birth,Doct. 2. not nature, not good education,
not benefits receiued, not comelineſſe of perſon, that can reſtraine
from helliſh outrage, if grace be wanting: this is apparent in
this Abſolom.
               To eſteeme highly of grace and the feare of God,Vſe. and earneſtly
to begge it at Gods hands, as being more forcible to
bridle corruption, & to make vs to eſchew euill, than al theſe.
               In that a remembrance is kept of Dauids perſecution, and
that by the vnnaturall rebellion of his owne ſonne, to glorifie
God, and to benefit the Church: we doe learne,
               
                  That the godly are not partiall,
                  Explanatiō. 
                  in publiſhing things as they
be without reſpect of perſons: they record the truth to the glory
of God, and the Churches good. Such a Chronicler was
Moſes, and all other pen-men of Gods ſpirit.
               A reproofe to the deceitfull and flattering records of men
in our times,Doct. in which truth is much falſified, by addition of
vertues, where they neuer were; by couering vices where
they were moſt notorious, and by a licentious enlarging or
abbreuiating, ſo as ſtories become a fabricke of flattery, and
almoſt a fable after the pen-mans pleaſure.
               Thus much touching the title of this Pſalme,Vſe. ſhewing the occaſion
of Dauids penning thereof: the Pſalme it ſelfe followeth.

againſt me?
               O Lord though I am now flying from my ſonne,Paraphraſe. yet do I
flye vnto thee, and am bould to poure forth my complaint
in thy preſence: truth it is that I did deſpiſe thy commandements
Sam. 12. 11. in killing Vriah with the ſword, and for this

thou didſt iuſtly threaten to raiſe vp euill againſt mee out of
mine owne houſe; but loe how now mine enemies are multiplied,
which bring mee into great ſtraights on euery ſide!
how many riſe vp in armes and open rebellion? and that
not onely out of mine owne houſe, but out of my whole
kingdome is euill raiſed againſt mee; not onely Abſolom my
ſonne, whom I ſo called, hoping hee ſhould haue beene the
Fathers peace, is now become the Fathers care and greefe;
but he hath2. Sam. 15. 6. ſtollen the hearts of my ſubiects from me,verſ 31.

more and more.
               
                  Lord.
                  Explanation.] Dauid in his afflictions when many came againſt
him, hath recourſe onely vnto God, to helpe him againſt
them all.
               The godly in their troubles haue recourſe vnto the Lord,Doct. as
to their refuge and ſuccour againſt the power of men, Pſalme
7. 1. 2. Chr. 20. 4. 6. 12. and 14. 11. and 13. 14. Ex. 14. 15.
Prou. 18. 10. 11.
               Heerein to follow the godly to ſeeke vnto the Lord,Vſe. 1. for
ſo are we commanded. Pſal. 50. and he will heare vs. Pſal. 9.
12. and 10. 17. and 34. 15. 17.
               A reproofe to ſuch as truſt not in God.Vſe 2. Pſalm. 52. 7. but
take aduiſe of the wicked, as in Pſal. 11. 1. and do after their
way. To relye on men, as is noted, Ier. 43. 5. 6. contrary to
Gods commandement. Ierem. 42. 10—14. as Achaz did,
2. Kings. 16. 7. 2. Chronicles. 28. 16—22. and as Aſah did,
2. Chron. 16. 7—9.
               In that Dauid being puniſhed of God for his ſinne,Explanation. as hee
well knew that this came vpon him (as God had ſaid) for the
ſinne againſt Vriah, yet now being repentant, Dauid neuertheleſſe,
through faith, which was not loſt, (2. Sam. 15. 25.
26. 32.) goeth vnto the Lord for helpe, we do learne,
               
                  That former ſinnes committed,
                  Doct. 
                  and preſent afflictions ſent of
God for them, cannot withhold the repentant faithfull from ſeeking
vnto God. Such is the power of faith in a repentant ſpirit,
as Dauids was, 2. Sam. 12. 13. & Manaſſes, 2. Chr. 33. 12. 13.
               
                  
Not to bee daunted vnder afflictions for thy treſpaſſes,Vſe. to
goe vnto God for deliuerance, if thou be repentant, for God
is exceeding mercifull, Pſal. 103. 8. 9. 13. 14. and 111. 4. Mich.
7. 18. He is nigh to all that are truly repentant, Pſal. 34. 18.
and 51. 17. Let this be our comfort againſt the knowledge of
our ſinne, and iuſt deſerts, in time of our trouble.
               
                  How] Dauid is ſtricken into an admiration of this conſpiracie,Explanation.
and alſo doth make a complaint; which ſhew, that hee
held himſelfe vnworthily handled of them: elſe he could not
haue admired and complained iuſtly.
               God is iuſt in puniſhing:Doct. and wee worthily deſerue it: yet may
we be innocent towards ſuch as be Gods rod, and ſo admire at them
and complaine of them, as Dauid doth here, and Pſal. 35. 7.
               To conſider of the inſtruments by whom wee be afflicted:Vſe.
for God vſeth not alwaies to puniſh vs by them whom wee
haue wronged, but ſometimes by them whom we haue done
good vnto, or not offended; that in reſpect of them, we might
craue helpe of God againſt them, which is not a ſmall comfort:
to haue God one way for vs, and not both God and
man iuſtly againſt vs.
               In that Dauid here ſheweth his griefe,Explanation. to bee thus vnnaturally,
and vnthankfully dealt with of thoſe, whom he had
done and wiſhed ſo great good vnto, we may learne,
               That a good man is troubled and grieued to haue thoſe to riſe
vp in hatred againſt him,Doct. whom he wiſheth well vnto. How heauily
Dauid tooke this, ſee 2. Sam. 15. 30. Ieremy was herewith
vexed, chap. 15. 10.
               
                  Not to paſſe ouer without any care ſuch things:
                  Vſe. 
                  for as a
learned man ſaith, Mali animi indicium eſt, ſuſque de
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   facere,
ameriſne vel odio habearis ab illis, quibuſcum viuendum eſt.
               
                  Are increaſed.
                  Explanatiō.] The hiſtorie doth ſhew the conſpiracie
began but with a few, 2. Sam. 15. 11. but after increaſed, verſe
12. and 18. 7.
               
                  Nothing ſo wickedly and heinouſly begun,
                  Doct. 
                  eſpecially by the
mightie, but eaſily will get liking of a multitude: See this in the
conſpiracie of Corah, Numb. 16. 1. 2. 19. and in Iudas treaſon
againſt Chriſt, Ioh. 13. 30. with Mat. 26. 47. and 27. 1. 20. the

like in Act. 19. 24. 29. ſee before Pſal. 2. 1. 2.
               Not to iudge well of a cauſe becauſe of a multitude:Vſe 1. for
worſt cauſes haue vſually moſt followers, becauſe the worſt
are the greateſt number, whoſe hearts are ſet on euill, and they
only want opportunitie; which once offered, they are as preſt
ſouldiers, readie at the leaſt alarum to runne to miſchiefe.
               To keepe vnder the wicked,Vſe. 2. for of ſmall beginnings they
will increaſe to a multitude: as did Antichriſt and his followers:
Reuel. 13. 11. 16. and 17. 2.
               
                  Mine aduerſaries.
                  Explanatiō.] The word Tſarim are enemies, which
incloſe and keepe ſtraight (without elbow roome, as we ſay)
ſuch as they come againſt, 2. King. 6. 1. 25. the word is there
vſed: and of this number was Abſolom his ſonne, Achitophel
his friend and Counſellor, with other men of place, &c. 2. Samuel
15. 12. 13. and 16. 15. and 17. 4. whom he calleth heere
aduerſaries to him. Whence note,
               
                  That ſuch as be friends at one time,
                  Doct. 1. 
                  may proue malicious enemies
at another: as theſe here proue to Dauid, whom hee ſuſpected
not, 2. Sam. 15. 9. Pſal. 41. 9. and 55. 13. 14.
               Seeing men are ſo wicked,Vſe. it is meete to walke euer warily,
and circumſpectly, one towards another. All are not faithful
that are preſent friends, eſpecially in proſperity when they
cannot be diſcerned well. Pro. 14. 20.
               
                  That as men ſhew themſelues,
                  Doct. 2. 
                  ſo are they to be taken and iudged:
for Dauid here calleth them enemies, and ſo accounteth
them euen in his complaint to God, who otherwiſe were before
all as friends, and ſome yet of his blood and kinred.
               To vſe our libertie of iudgement, if we finde men aduerſaries
indeed (though neuer ſo nigh in blood,Vſe. affinitie, neighbourhood,
or otherwiſe) then ſo to hold them, till they ſhew
the contrary: right iudgement is one thing: and mercifully
to forgiue is another; and both may ſtand together.
               It may not be omitted that Dauid here calleth them aduerſaries
onely,Explanation. and not malicious, vngratefull, vnnaturall, and
cruell, as elſewhere, Pſalme 35. 11. and 43. 1. and 59. 2. 5. and
71. 4. for heere was his ſonne, but others with him miſled,
2. Sam. 15. 11. and all of them as Gods rod for the preſent to

afflict him: which no doubt he well weighed.
               Naturall affection to ſome that are our aduerſaries,Doct. error in
other ſome miſled (as here, 2. Sam. 15. 11.) that all are alſo Gods
preſent rod of chastiſement for ſinne: and lastly, not without hope
to be reconciled againe, (as Dauid hoped, 2. Sam. 15. 25. 26.) are
great meanes to restraine our thoughts, and to moderate our
words towards them.
               To temper our ſelues towards ſuch as doe ſhew themſelues
aduerſaries againſt vs,Vſe. euen in an high degree, let vs yet conſider
what they are to vs, how they are led, what hope of reconcilement,
and that God by them doth humble vs, ſo ſhall wee
not be inraged againſt them.
               
                  Many are they that riſe vp.
                  Explanatiō.] As before he calleth them aduerſaries,
ſo now hee declareth what manner of aduerſaries,
and the number to be many.
               Godly men may be exerciſed and humbled,Doct. not with one or a
few, but with many aduerſaries, as Dauid heere: ſo Ieremy, and
Chriſt Ieſus, S. Paul, &c.
               
               Not to thinke therefore this triall ſtrange,Vſe. if ſo wee thus be
exerciſed, and finde not one, or a few, but very many aduerſaries.
               Aduerſaries in an inſurrection and rebellion:Explanatiō. they at the
firſt came together but at the ſacrifice, 2. Sam. 15. 11. 12. but
after it proued a treaſonable flocking, breaking out into open
rebellion.
               
                  Popular flockings vnto an aſpiring ſpirit (as was Abſolō) breeds
rebellion,
                  Doct. which vpon fit occaſion, time, and place, will openly
breake foorth, as we doe here ſee, and Chronicles ſhew.
               A caueat for Princes to ſee vnto this:Vſe. 
                  Abſoloms are ſeditious,
and the ſeditious ſeeke only euill, Pro. 17. 11. The ſaying
of Salomon, verſ. 14. is moſt true in ſtrife of this kinde for
a kingdome: but hee that exalteth his gate ſeeketh deſtruction,
verſ. 19.
               
                  Againſt me.
                  Explanatiō.] Euen againſt Dauid a good and vertuous
King, Pſal. 78. 72. yet againſt him doe theſe riſe, who had no
cauſe to be his enemies: but yet by theſe God chaſtiſed him
for his ſinne: teaching,
               
                  
That moſt excellent good and holy men,Doct. 1. Kings, and Prophets,
may haue aduerſaries, and traiterous rebels againſt them, without
any cauſe on their part: Daniel 6. 4. Pſalme 59. 3. for ſome hate
goodneſſe it ſelfe, Pſalme 38. 20. and thoſe that are good, Ioh.
15. 19.
               Let not any,Vſe. 1. whether Princes or Paſtors thinke to be without
aduerſaries in this world, though they ſhould liue neuer
ſo innocently.
               Not to thinke therefore men are alwaies worthie blame,Vſe 2.
becauſe they haue aduerſaries, though great, learned, noble,
and many of them: for ſo had innocent Daniel, yea Ieſus
Chriſt; nor to iudge Princes wicked, becauſe ſome proue rebels
and traitors againſt them, as were here againſt good Dauid.
               
               That albeit Princes doe not deſerue ſuch traiterous practiſes,Doct. 2.
and rebellions, from their ſubiects; yet may the ſame be Gods correction
for ſinne againſt them: as this was vpon Dauid, 2. Chr.
24. 25. and 25. 27.
               The mighty to conſider themſelues in ſuch rebellions,Vſe. and
bee reconciled vnto God, who ſubdueth the people vnder
their hands, Pſalme 7. For albeit they may bee innocent towards
their ſubiects, yet the Lord is euer iuſt in his proceedings.
               Note that rebellion is called a riſing vp,
                  Explanation. (when other ſinnes
are compared to falling) in regard of high hearts, and proud
aſpiring ſpirits, as alſo of the high dignitie of Kings, which
they oppoſe themſelues againſt rebelliouſly.
               They that are rebels ſinne highly,Doct. in pride of ſpirit, and againſt
kingly maieſtie, the moſt high calling vpon earth: but as they ariſe
high, they fall downe low, as the example in hand ſheweth, and
experience in all ages confirmeth.
               
               Take heed of rebellion:Vſe. Feare God and honour the King.
Dauid had a deadly aduerſarie of Saul, hee was a troubler of
the people, and a murtherer of the Lords Prieſts: yet being
the Lords annointed, he would not meddle with him. We are
forbidden to haue euill thoughts in our hearts againſt kings:

many of them do further alſo perſecute me with words
of hatred, andPſal. 69. 20. vexe my ſoule with contumelies and reproches.
For this indeed goeth to the very heart of me, that when
I might haue looked for ſome to haue pitie on me, they contrarily
extoll themſelues againſt me, with rebukes and taunts,
as if I were vtterly forlorne, and paſt all hope, ſaying, There,

and hath no helpe in ſtore for him.
               Heere Dauid bringeth in his enemies words,Explanation. by which no
doubt they encouraged themſelues in this foule fact, and
ſought to confound the ſpirit of him heereby, of which hee
here doth chiefly complaine, and mention vnto the Lord.

rout ſo ſaid, and yet it was an error.
               
                  Error and falſehood (and eſpecially that which is for the
ouerthrow of the godly) gets ſoone many fauourites,
                  Doct. as appeareth
by that curſed falſe report ſpread by the ſouldiers, Matth.

Therefore beware of credulitie,Vſe. and before we doe entertaine
ſpeeches, let vs weigh them well, and only by triall approue,

not onely diſtreſſe him with deedes, but vexe him alſo with
words.

               To prepare our ſelues as well for reproches,Vſe. as other croſſes;
for the godly haue had their part in both, Iob. 30. 1. 9. 10.

                  Explanation. this word ſome tranſlate of my ſoule,
and ſo the ſoule put for the whole man, as is vſuall: but the
word will beare the other ſenſe, and is more forcible: for Dauid
doth not only ſhew what they ſpake, but how he tooke it,
euen as a ſword piercing to his ſoule.
               Words (ſuch may they be many times) will cauſe more trouble
to the afflicted,Doct. and adde ſorrow to other preſent outward croſſes:
Pſal. 69. 20. and 42. 10. Lam. 2. 15. 16.
               Not to breake out into inſulting,Vſe. contumelious taunting,
or otherwiſe diſgracefull ſpeeches towards others, eſpecially
the afflicted: for though they be but words, yet may they be
wounding, and encreaſe anguiſh in ſoule, and may make ſad
the hearts of the righteous; a ſinne which God one day will
puniſh, Ezek. 13. 22. 23.
               
                  There is no helpe for him in God.
                  Explanatiō.] The Hebrew word Ieſugnah
is Ieſugnathah, a letter added for to encreaſe the ſignification,
as if it were ſaid, there is no manner of helpe at all: the
like is in Pſal. 44. 27. and 92. 16. and 94. 17. and 63. 8. and 12.
1. 2. Iob. 5. 16. This is their iudgement of him, yet they incouraged
themſelues againſt him, with this, that he could not
now hope for deliuerance from God.
               This is the peruerſe iudgement of the wicked,Doct. 1. to thinke that if
God afflict his children, and let them alone a while, he indeed hath

vtterly forſaken them: Pſal. 41. 8. 2. Sam. 16. 7. 8.
               The wicked to learne hereby to rectifie this iudgement,Vſe 1.
ſeeing the caſe is farre otherwiſe, Pſal. 103. 9. he chaſtiſeth in
loue, and not in hatred, Heb. 12. 6. Reuel. 3. 19. Pro. 3. 12.
               The godly not to regard what the wicked thinke of them,Vſe 2.
their iudgement is peruerſe.
               It is a ſtrong motiue in the wicked,Doct. 2. being conceited (though
falſly) that God is for them, and againſt the godly, to riſe vp and
vexe them. Pſal. 71. 11.
               Godly to pray for their enemies,Vſe 1. to reforme their opinion
herein, which ſo heartens them in euill.
               The wicked to conſider,Vſe 2. how they are by the lying ſpirit
deceiued, when they riſe againſt the godly; behold the end
God made for Dauid, againſt Abſolom, Achitophel, and the
reſt, who being in preſent proſperitie, and perhaps remembring
Nathans words againſt Dauid, 2. Sam. 12. 10. 11. conclude
thus wickedly, as it may ſeeme, 2. Sam. 16. 8. but the end
ſheweth they were deceiued.
               In that Dauid complaineth of this ſpeech,Explanation. and not of his
ſonnes vnnaturalnes, the ingratitude of others, or of any other
outward euill done by them in particular in their rebellion,
but only this it doth teach,
               
                  That to be iudged as vtterly forſaken of God,
                  Doct. 
                  is a greater temptation
then all outward troubles, Pſal. 42. 10. for they cannot ouercome
this heauie temptation but by the eſpeciall grace of
God, giuing ſtrength of faith in this combat.
               Godly to pray with Dauid,
                  Vſe. 1. Pſal. 35. 3. and to haue hope, as
he had. 2. Sam. 16. 10. 12.
               Not to torment the poore afflicted with ſuch a dart of Sathan.Vſe. 2.
               
               This may terrifie the wicked:Vſe. 3. for if the godly be troubled
herewith, who know the contrary by the word: how ſhould
not horror poſſeſſe their hearts, when they may heare this againſt
themſelues euery where in the word, and ſhall at the

               We may therefore by this obſerue a ſtay,Vſe. or pauſing time,

                  &c.] Dauid here recalleth his thoughts
from his enemies comfortleſſe ſpeeches, profeſſing his faith in
God, not beleeuing their wicked ſpeeches: but reſteth in the
Lords powerful protection, whatſoeuer they ſay againſt him:
from this courſe of this holy Prophet we may learne,
               That the godly wiſe doe ſo take knowledge of their temptations,Doct. 1
to be there with in ſoule perplexed, as yet they recall their
thoughts from thence, to comfortable meditations, which may
giue them ſtrength in God, Pſ. 119. 23. 92. Pſ. 27. 13. 2. Cor.
4. 16. 18.
               To admoniſh the ſoule drooping in temptations,Vſe. not to refuſe
comfort as Rachell; but with Dauid to turn our thoughts
to better comfort, and correct our ſelues as he did, Pſal. 42.
11. and ſay as he, Pſa. 71. 7. 20.
               That the godly beleeue not what wicked men iudge of their
caſe betweene God and themſelues:Doct. 2. they paſſe not of mens
iudgement, as S. Paul ſpeakes, 1. Cor. 4. 3.
               Not to be caſt downe with the iudgement of wicked perſons.Vſe.
For Gehezi ſeeth the danger, but not the ſafeguard,
2. Kings 6. till his eyes be open, but Eliſha and Dauid know
that God is their defence, and that it is farre better with them
than the wicked thinke.
               
                  Dauid was now in a three-fold diſtreſſe,Explanation. and for his comfort
hee conſidereth, the Lord to anſwere him to them all,
teaching.
               
                  That he that hath the Lord,
                  Doct. 
                  is ſufficiently comforted againſt
the wicked. For Dauid was ſuccourleſſe, God is his buckler;
Dauid was contemned, God is his glory: hee was caſt
downe, God is his lifter vp.
               To reioyce more in the aid of God,Vſe. than in al the ſtrength
of men, and let vs not feare their oppoſitions, the Lord is

all-ſufficient, Geneſ. 17. 1. and wee are not alone, though all

               God is a ſhield,Doct. a protection, and ſure defence to his children.

                  My glory.
                  Explanation.] By godly, hee vnderſtands his kingly dignity,
and adorning, as Mat. 6. 29. and he calleth God his glory, for
that he aduanced him thereunto, and would maintaine it againſt
his enemies. As he calleth him his ſhield, that is, hee
that will defend him, ſo now his glory, for that he wil maintaine
his dignity.
               Kingly dignity is glory,Doct. 1. 
                  Mat. 6. 29. but yet weighty, as chabod

               The godly make the Lord to bee that vnto them which
they are:Doct. 2. if rich, glorious, ſtrong, &c. they hold him to bee
their wealth, glory, ſtrength, as Dauid here doth.
               Whatſoeuer we be,Vſe. hold God to be that vnto vs, thereby
ſhall we acknowledge him the author thereof and preſeruer,
and that we eſteeme him aboue them, while wee haue them,

for in ſorrow the head hangeth downe. 1. Kings. 21. 27. as
Dauids did heere: ſo when mens hearts are glad, they lift vp
their heads. Pſal. 110. 7. Luke 21. 28. from this manner of
ſpeaking, and his hope in God, we may note,
               That a very godly mans heart will be heauy,Doct. 1. and his countenance
caſt downe in afflictions for his ſinnes, though hee know
that God doth forgiue him. 2. Sam. 15. 30. with 12. 13.
               Iuſtly to condemne ſuch as be like 2.Vſe. Chron. 28. 22. not
humbled for iudgements, and yet without aſſurance of pardon:
but if afflictions make ſad ſuch a one, oh! in the day of
wrath how ſhall other be ouerwhelmed with ſorrowes?
               That it is God that lifteth vp his,Doct. 2. and maketh them glad in

               I did call vpon the Lord with my voyce,Text. and he heard me out
of his holy mountaine.
               THis my hope (know ye.Paraphraſe. O mine enemies) is not vaine
or groundleſſe, but I am perſwaded heereof by former
experiments of his help at hand, when I called vpon him: for
this was I went to doe in all my troubles, and herein haue alwaies
found comfort and ſucceſſe, leauing the thought of all
humane ayde, I betooke my ſelfe to earneſt prayer, and that
not onely in the ſecret ſighes and ſilent wiſhes of my troubled
ſoule, but with ſtrong cryes did I importune his helpe,
and lift vp myPſal. 66. 17. voyce, together with my harty deſires, which
aſcended into his ſanctuary on mount Sion; yea into heauen
it ſelfe the ſeat of his holineſſe, from whence hee hath heard
me, and not putting backe myPſ. 66. 19. 20. prayers, nor his mercie from
me, hath anſwered my requeſts, in giuing me ſuch things as I
prayed for.
               
                  Dauid heere beginneth to turne his thoughts to himſelfe,Explanation
and conſiders what formerly he had done, and how God had
dealt with him, interrupting his complaint to God, to ſpeake
to himſelfe thus in 45. and 6. verſes, before he braſt out into
prayer againe, teaching,
               That the experience of Gods former mercies and helpe,Doct. is a
good confirmation of our faith, to looke againe for helpe in preſent
perills. 1. Sam. 17. 32. 34—37. 2. Chron. 20. 7-10.
2. Tim 4. 17. 18.
               To take notice of Gods goodneſſe towards vs from time
to time,Vſe. that by former mercies wee may be ſtrengthened in
our faith, to expect helpe from God in preſent perills. Pſalm.
77. 11.
               
                  I did call.
                  Explanatiō.] Hee ſheweth the meanes hee vſed for helpe in
his former troubles, as alſo now, verſ. 7. to teach,
               That inuocation and prayer,Doct. is one thing, in which the godly
exerciſe themſelues in aduerſity, and the meanes they vſe for

deliuerance. 2. Chron. 20. 2—13. Eſa 37. 14—20. Pſal. 18.
3. and. 5. 1. 2. 3. 10. 11. Act. 4.
               In aduerſity and trouble,Vſe. to giue our ſelues to prayer, as
we ſee the godly doe: for God will helpe ſuch as doe call vpon
him, Pſal. 50. 15. 2. Chron. 13. 14. 15. and 14. 11. 12. and
16. 9. and 77. 2. 3.
               
                  With my voyce.
                  Explanation.] The word chara is to crie, and here voyce is
added: for there is a crying as well without voyce, as with it:
Exod. 14. 15.
               True prayer is a crying in the eares of the Lord,Doct. and the feruencie
thereof cauſeth the ſound of the voyce, and the mouth to
ſpeake aloud: Exod. 14. 15. Heb. 5. 7. Pſal. 66. 17. 2. Chron.
32. 20. 1. King. 8. 28.
               To be feruent in our prayers vnto God,Vſe. 1. ſuch prayers auaile
much. Iam. 5. 16.
               A reproofe to ſuch as be remiſſe and cold in prayer,Vſe. 2. neuer
come to crying in the eares of the Lord: but pray ſuperſtitiouſly,
or formally, and not heartily.
               
                  Vnto the Lord.
                  Explanation.] Dauid ſheweth to whom he prayed, euen
to the Lord.
               
                  The godly pray only to God,
                  Doct. 
                  and to none but him, Gen. 4. 26.
and 12. 8. and ſo did all the faithfull, and no inſtance to the
contrary.
               To make our prayers only to God;Vſe. not to Saints, Angels,
or Virgin Mary, but to him whom wee can call Father. Matthew
6.
               
                  And he heard me.
                  Explanatiō.] Here is the ſucceſſe he found in prayer:
God heard him. The word gna-nah is to anſwere, which is to
heare, as he certifieth that hee heareth, and granteth their requeſts
which pray to him.
               
                  That the godly pray not in vaine,
                  Doct. 1. 
                  it is not loſt labour to call vpon
him, as examples ſhew, 2. Chron. 13. 14. 15. and 14. 11. 12.
and Dauid witneſſeth experimentally, Pſal. 6. 9. and 22. 24.
and 118. 5. So we may ſee alſo 2. Chron. 30. 20. 27.

                  That God is faithfull in his promiſe to performe it.
                  Doct. 1. This Dauid

               It is to be noted,Explanatiō. that the Prophet doth ſhew firſt how he
came to be ſo ſecure, to lie downe in his perils, euen by prayer
and faith reſting in God, who did heare him before he betooke
himſelfe to ſleepe: teaching,
               That a godly mans ſecuritie,Doct. is not of a ſenſeleſſe ſtupiditie, nor

as with mine earneſt prayers, again craue it at thy hāds;
and as mine enemies rebelliouſly riſe vp againſt mee, ſo doe
thou in thy righteouſneſſe ariſe for my cauſe. Stand vp O
Lord and that ſoone, let not man preuaile: doe not nowPſal. 44. 24. by

which thou doſt vouch ſafe to be my God, and to giue me a
Right in thine owne ſelfe; ſo I beſeech thee to helpe mee thy

to giue a reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt, euen from thy wonted
goodneſſe, and former deliuerances, which haue beene euer
of old: in which reſpect thou ſhouldſt ſeeme vnlike thy ſelfe,
except it pleaſe thee to helpe me at this time alſo. But ſo it is
that heretofore thou haſt alwaies holpen mee in my greateſt
extreamities, and haſt ſmittenMicah. 5. 1. mine enemies with moſt ignominious
& condign puniſhments: and when they thought
preſently to deuoure and eate mee vp, like ſo many ramping

thePſal. 58. 6. and 22. 21. iawes, and breake their teeth, and plucke mee as a pray
out of their mouthes, by bringing fearefull iudgements vpon
them, and abating their force, and repreſſing their rage, that
they had no power at all to harme or annoy me.
               Hauing thus fitted himſelfe to pray:Explanatiō. firſt, complaining:
ſecondly, by faith, repelling the temptation: and ſo thirdly

his holy boaſting againſt his enemies, as not fearing any of
them, yet heere he immediately cryeth O Lord, and craueth
his helpe, to ſhew,
               That a godly man is ſo ſecure,Doct. 1. ſo without feare, and ſo perſwaded

6. 10. 12. and 17. 13. &c. which is attributed vnto God, becauſe
while he ſuffers the wicked, he ſeemeth to ſit as careles,

to ariſe,Doct. 1. heereby teaching,
               That the patience of God (through which the wicked ſometime

raigne and rule) is not for euer, but ſhort, and as a ſleeping

               Faith in prayer is much confirmed from experience of the mercies
granted,Doct. like to thoſe which at the preſent we begge at Gods

blow is deadly. The word alſo doth note a certaintie, to
marke ſo where to ſtrike, as to ſtrike ſure, as God can doe.
               God will reuenge the cauſe of the godly vpon all their enemies,Doct. 2.
and will take part with the godly againſt al that ſhall riſe vp againſt
them, Geneſ. 12. 3. Numb. 24. 9. The inſtances are in the enemies
of Iſrael, of Ioſhuah, of Dauid, Iehoſaphat, &c.
               
               Not to be enemies vnto the godly,Vſe 1. for they ſhall not onely
be fruſtrate of their purpoſes: but alſo bring euill vpon themſelues:
as Dauids enemies did here, and Pſal. 9. 3. 4. 5.
               Comfort to the godly,Vſe. 2. that they haue ſuch a one to ſtand
for thē, one that can and will ſmite their enemies. Pſ. 9. 9. 10.
               
                  
                     Ʋpon the cheeke bone.
                  Explanation.] To ſmite thus, is vſed in contempt
and reproch, Iob. 16. 10. 1. King. 22. 24. but here alſo to ſet
out Gods power, who can confound the enemie, as a ſtrong
man can a child with his fiſt.
               
                  The Lord hath all the wicked in contempt,
                  Doct. Pſa. 2. 4. and 59. 8.
and 37. 13. and can eaſily confound them: Example in the ouerthrow
of Babel, Gen. 11. the Aegyptians, Exo. 14. the Aethiopians,
2. Chron. 14.
               Not therefore to feare the wicked:Vſe. but waite on the Lord,
Eſa. 8. 13. 14. with verſes 9. 10.
               
                  Thou haſt broken the teeth of the wicked.
                  Explanation.] Here is expreſſed
the force of that blow vpon the cheeke bone; it breaketh
their teeth, that is their meanes to hurt, Pſal. 57. 4. compared
to teeth, Pſ. 124. 6. as the wicked are to lions, Pſ. 57. 4. & dogs,
Pſ. 22. 10. whoſe iawes and teeth being broken, cannot hurt.
               The reuenging hand of God can ſo ſmite the wicked,Doct. as he therby
depriueth them of the meanes, by which they become as ſauage
beaſts hurtfull vnto the godly. He deſtroyed Senacheribs hoaſt,
brake his teeth, and put a ring into the beares noſtrill to leade
him home againe. Eſa. 37.
               
                  
Let vs therefore make our prayers vnto God:Vſe. who (as he
can) ſo he would in mercie ſmite them, and breake their teeth
in ſunder, diſarme them of their meanes to hurt his people, as
Dauid doth, Pſal. 58. 6. 7. 8. ſo though they remaine dogges
barking, yet he will make them ſure for biting.
            
            
               VERSE VIII.
               Saluation belongeth vnto the Lord,Text. and thy bleſſing be vpon
the people.
               NOw for theſe and all other thy great deliuerances,Paraphraſe. which
thou haſt wrought for me, thine be all praiſe, and glory,
Reuel. 7. 10. and 12. 10. and 19. 1. ſaluation, and might, and power, be aſcribed vnto thee, to
whom alone it belongeth: only for the people, let me requeſt
thy fauour; euen for theſe alſo, who being miſled, haue fallen
away to Abſolom: for many of them went in the ſimplicitie
2. Sam. 15. 11. of their hearts: not knowing any thing at the firſt of ſuch a
rebellious purpoſe: therefore Lord whatſoeuer their ſin hath
been, yet in ſtead of curſing, doe thou bleſſe: bleſſePſal. 29. 11. them, I
ſay, with peace and concord, with loyaltie and obedience,
with plentiePſal. 28. 9. and proſperitie, and all other thy benefits and
graces heaped vpon them.
               
                  Saluation to or of the Lord.
                  Explanatiō.] This verſe is a general ſentence
concluding the Pſalme, which Dauid gathered by good experience:
the meaning is, that howſoeuer we bee deliuered,
ſafetie is from God, who hath euer meanes to ſaue his.
               
                  The power of ſauing is with God:
                  Doct. for heere it is not ſaid that
he ſaueth: but which is more, ſaluation is of him: Pro. 21. 31.
Ionah 2. 9. Reuel. 7. 10. and 19. 1. Eſa. 12. 2.
               To acknowledge all ſafetie from the Lord,
                     Ʋſe 1. whoſoeuer the
inſtruments, or whatſoeuer the means be, as Dauid doth, praiſing
the Lord: Pſal. 18. 46. 47. 48. 49. and 144. 8. and 148. 7.
Exod. 15. 2. Iudg. 15. 18. 1. Sam. 11. 1.—13.
               To truſt in him,Vſe. 2. and to relie vpon him, Pſal. 57. 1. 2. Sam.
22. 3. becauſe ſaluation is with him, that is, hee is neuer without
meanes to ſaue ſuch as truſt in him.
               This reproueth them that aſcribe it to mans power,Vſe 3. policie

or chance, Saints, Idols, &c. but reade Pſalme 33. 16. 17. and
20. 7. Eſa. 10. 4.
               
                  Thy bleſſing vpon the people.
                  Explanatiō.] By bleſſing is meant plentifull
beſtowing of good things, Gen. 24. 35. Deut. 28. 2—Eph. 1. 3.
Gal. 3. 8. And thus Dauid prayeth for the people euen rebelling
againſt him: ſuch is his loue towards them.
               
                  That a gracious good King,
                  Doct. 
                  loueth, prayeth for, and wiſheth all
good to his people: 1. King. 8. 22.—2. Chr. 29. 18. 19. euen when
they haue ſhewed themſelues rebels alſo againſt him, as Moſes
did, Numb. 14. 2. 13—19. and Dauid here.
               Princes to be like minded towards their ſubiects in theſe
daies,Vſe. to loue them, to pray for them, and to wiſh them al happineſſe,
Pſal. 28. 9. and 29. 11. At the prayer of good Hezekiah,
the Lord heard and healed the people, 2. Chron. 30. 20.
yea at his requeſt alſo deliuered them, and confounded the
deuouring aduerſaries. 2. Chron. 32. 20. 21.
               If the words be taken not as a prayer,Explanatiō. but as a part of the
ſentence with the former; then it is, as if it had been ſaid, that
he praiſed God for this ſaluation ſhewed to him, which was
Gods bleſſing vpon his people: for ſo here they be called: and
ſo from hence may we learne,
               
                  That the preſeruation of a godly and a gracious King,
                  Doct. 1. 
                  is the
bleſſing of God vpon the people, 1. King. 10. 9. That which may
be ſaid of the ſetting vp of ſuch a King, the ſame may be auouched
of the preſeruing him. 2. Sam, 5. 12.
               To bleſſe God for the long life and reigne of godly Kings
and Queenes:Vſe. for their liues are the peoples bleſſing, as may
appeare in Dauid, Iehoſaphat, Hezekiah, Ioſiah, &c. And the
manifold change of Princes is a puniſhment of God for the
ſinnes of the people, as Salomon tels vs.
               That the people committed to the charge of the mightie,Doct. 2. are the
Lords, and not theirs. 1. Sam. 2. 24. 2. Sam. 5. 2.
               The mightie Potentates to conſider of this,Vſe. that their Soueraigntie
is a charge (as Moſes ſpeaketh, Numb. 11. 11.) ouer
Gods people: and therefore to reigne as did Dauid, 2. Sam. 8.
15. knowing that they ſhall make account vnto God for his
people, committed to their cuſtodie.
               FINIS.
