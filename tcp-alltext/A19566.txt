was gods word (for that is the swete
and pleasaūt grape / that maketh glad
the hart of man) with great freedome
preached / earnestly embraced / and with
gredy hartes in all places receaued.
            Then was Godes great glory maruelously
auaunced. Then the onely merytes
of Chryste / then trewe repentaunce
for oure former synnes / then
trust in gods mercy through the death
of our sauyoure Christe / with a newe
Christian life / was truly published / &
preached euery wher. Then was ther
the common praier rightlye vsed / and

the Sacramēts (Baptisme I meane
and the holi Communion) in suche a
tounge and language set forthe / that
all people myghte vnderstande them.
Then were they playnlye ministred
without any iuglinge or sorcerie / accordyng
to Christes institucyon and
the rule of hys holye worde. Whiche
worde / at that time / had the pryce &

With gods word was euery mās

so long / till all was playde vnder
the boorde. But what was the cause
of all this? Truly none other thing / 
but oure owne sinnes and wickednes.
For we were talkers onelye and not
walkers / lippe gospellers, from the
mouth outewarde and no farther.
We were euen suche / as the prophet
speaketh of / saying:Esai. xxix. thys people honoreth

me with their lyppes / but are
farre from me with their hartes. We
coulde speake of gods word / and talke
gloryously therof: but in oure hartes
we were full of pryde / malice / enuye / 
couetousnesse / backebitynge / riosing / 
harlot hauntinge / no whitte bettered
at all / then we were before / vnder the
Popes kingdom. Nothing was in vs
amended but only our tonges / no nor
they neither / if I shall speake ryghtly
and as the trueth was in dede. For besydes
oure communycacion of scrypture / 
we vsed detraction of our neighboure / 
filthy talke / with many proud
bragges of our selues. We red not the
scryptures / neither harde them for any
amendmente of oure owne wicked
lyues: but onely to make a bragge
and a shewe thereof / to checke and to
taunte others / yea and to spye small
motes in other mens eies / but nothing
desyerous to see the greate beames in
oure owne.Math. vii. a. This I saye (to talke and
not to walke / to say & not to do) was
not onely amongest the vnlerned sort:

but also amongeste the greate clarkes
and chefe preachers of gods worde.
            Whiche thynge (as I iudge) was the
only cause / why god / by his iust iudgemente / 
suffered his electe and chosen

to disgrace the merites of Christes passion / 
and in place thereof / to sette vp
mens merytes / and in steade of hys
sufficyent satisfaction vpon the crosse
once for all / to sette vp hys masses satisfactorye
for the synnes / both of the
quicke and deade.The Pope geueth lies for trueth, poison for norishinge sustenaūce, and ministreth death for life.
            
            This is the cause / that this mōsterous
beast hath taught the inuocation
of saincts / and the same to be our medyators
to God / and satysfyers for
oure sinnes. Where as before / in the

            Thys bloody Bore / besides al mischeues
that he hath done to the vineyarde / 
yet ceaseth he not / with faggotfier / 
and all other cruell tormentes /

yet these shameles wretches be not abashed

because they be laie mens bokes /

leading them to the trewe worshippe

Oh spitfull robbery. What is

his worde written to bee euery mans

            By whiche wordes it appeareth
plaine / that there was neuer man so
vertuous / so holy / nor so wel learned / 
onely the writers of the holi scripturs
excepted / but either of Ignoraunce / 
or of neglygence / there escaped some
faultes in his writinges and doinges.
Yea the generall counsels themselues
also / that they make so much of / haue

notably erred / as hereafter shalbe declared.The general coū
                  sels haue erred and that in no smal trifles.
Yea suche hath been the trueth
of those seen churches / that one generall
counsell hath cōdemned another
of heresie. Moreouer / the outwarde
seen churche / wherof they bragge not a
litel / hath neuer since the beginninge / 
any space continued in the true doctrine
of god. Let vs beginne at Moses / 
who was the first law geuer / and
we shal see the state of this outwarde
churche / which consisteth in the ordinarie
succession of Bishoppes / whether
it be so as I haue said or no. Whē
Moses was gone vp to the mounte
Sinai / to talke with God / and to receaue
the lawe at his handes:Exodus. xxxii. a. did not
Aaron / the hiegh Priest and Bishop / 
with al the people / in the mene space
worship the golden Calfe? reade the
boke of Iudges / and you shal see how
the whole outwarde & visible church
fell to Idolatrie and worshippinge of
straunge goddes: as Baal / Astaroth / 
goddes of the Edomites / Moabites / 
Philistines / and the Sirians. After

the reigne of king Dauid / howe many
kynges were there (I praye you) in
whose tyme false gods were not openly
worshipped? All the kynges of Israel
serued straunge gods wyth the consent
of the Byshoppes / priestes / & the
hole people. And in Iuda / there passed
not .iii or foure kinges after Dauyd / 
in whose dayes open Idolatrye was
not alowed and practysed / by the consente
of the kinges / Bishoppes / hyegh
priestes / Scrybes & Pharises. Which
of the Prophetes did not the open &
visible churche persecute? Where was
the visible churche in the tyme of Elias?
Were not al / that were knowne
and thought to be of the churche / worshyppers
of Baal: in somuch that Elias
thought there had bene left aliue
of gods true churche / but himselfe only?
And yet not wythstandynge God
had preserued hys churche / knowne
but onely to hymselfe / for he knoweth
who ar his.2. Tim. 2. Who smote Micheas the
true Prophete of God / but the chefe
Priest and Bishoppe Zedechias?3. Reg. 22. And

he / with foure hūdred Pryestes more
of his own minde and religion / disceaued
Achab / and promysed him victory
ouer the Assirians / although God
had made them no such promyse / but
rather had pomted the contrarye / as
it came to passe.Hiere. 20 Vho commaunded Ieremy
to be beaten for his true prophesyeng / 
but Phashur the Archebishop?
Who perswaded wyth the kinge / that
Ieremy / the true Prophete of God / 
was a sedicious felowe / and wente about
to discorage the people in Ierusalem
that they shoulde not resyste Nabuchodonozor
kyng of Babylon / but
the priestes?This and such like, is the rewarde of al true preachers and faithful seruauntes of god. Yea / and when the kynge
deliuered him out of prison / who but
these holy men of the Churche / procured
hym to be caste agayne into a depe
doungyō where they would haue famyshed
hym / if God had not put in
the kynges harte to take hym out and
deliuer him? These be the fruites and
practyses of the vysyble and seene
Churche / whyche / if it bee true

that the papistes say / cānot erre. But
what so euer they saye it forceth not:
for we knowe what the spiritualty / 
as they cal thēselfes / haue beē since the
beginning / the verye expressed image
wherof is set forth and declared in the
Machabies / as they that reade the
story shal perceaue it wel inough / by Alcinus /

Now let vs come to the new testamēt
and see what the visible and knowen
churche was vnder it. Who was the
true churche / or how was it knowen
to the people in Christes time? The
hiegh Priestes / Bishoppes / Scribes / 
Pharises / and Saduces / whiche appeared
outwardly and boasted themselues
to bee the churche of god: were
in dede / as Christ called thē / ser pētes / 
the generacions of vipers / hipocrites / 
children of hell / painted tombes / perse
cuters of true religion / and murtherers
of the prophetes / yea of himselfe
and his Apostles:Math. iii. b. xii. c. xxiii. d. men that shut vp the
kingdome of heauen / so that neyther
they would enter therein themselues / 

nor suffer the poore simple / that were
desierous to knowe the trueth / to enter:
but excommunycated / and thrust
them out of the churche / as men caste
awaye / as heretikes / and forsaken of
God / whosoeuer beleued on Chryste.
Who commaunded the Apostles that
they should preach no more in Christs
name?Act. iiii. d Actes. vii. g. Euse. ecc. his. lib. ii. cap. xxii. Acte. ix. Actes. xxiii. Who caused Steuen to be stoned?

               us
the french kyng / assoiling his subiects
from theyr obedyence to hym & made
Pipine kynge in hys steade / but the
Pope and hys Churche men? Let vs
come to oure own realme and speake
of thinges done in our own memory.
Who procured kyng Henry the eyghte
in the beginning of his reigne to war
agaynst the frenche kinge / where beesides
the murther cōmytted / adultery
was lerned / theft & sacrilege practised / 
lying / swearing / yea and for sweringe

with all other kindes of vyces vsed / 
whych be the very fruites of war / but
the cleargy? For the pope / thē being in
warre with the French king / to make
his part good & the stronger / procured
the Bishops of the church of Englād / 
beyng the Popes deare darlynges / &
chefe of the kinges counsel / to entytle
the kyng to his right of the realme &
crown of Fraūce: & to encourage the
young kyng thereto / the Pope accursed
the kyng of Fraūce & al his aiders
& succurrers. Then free pardons flue
abroade as thycke / as butter flyes in
sommer:the Pope maketh him selfe equall to God, yea rather aboue him in this his promise. but so free / that the realme
therby and the sayd warres was robbed
of a grate deale of our treasure / 
and in maner halfe vndone. There
was ful remission a pena & culpa / preached
at paules crosse / & almost in eueri
sermō / through al England: promisīg
that whoso euer died in the Popes
quarel / his soule should be in heauen
before his bones wer colde. After whē
the same kinge Henrye had iustlye / 
by the aucthoryte of GODES

worde / and the ful consent both of the
parliament / and conuocacion / abolyshed
the vsurped power of the Bishop
of Rome: then the Pope enterdyted
the whole Realme / and sent Cardinal
Poole from prince to prince / to excite
and moue them (if he coulde haue
broughte it to passe) to make open
warre against the king and the realm / 
as it appeareth in a Sermō preached
by Tonstall nowe Bishoppe of Durham / 
and set out in prynte openly.This is one of the practises of prelates.
            
            Which sermon & al other tel truthes / 
openinge the abuses and tirannye of
the Bishop of Rome / are now put to
silence. Who were the workers of all
these mischeues? who these .iii. yeres
paste / hath persecuted / prisoned / and
burned so many learned and Godlye
men / onely for their true faythes sake
grounded vpon gods most holy worde
(men worthy to bee cōpared with the
olde martirs of the primitiue church / 
as well for the constancye of theyr
fayth / as also for pacience and charity
shewed at their deathes) but the

churche / as they call thēselues?The spiritual man neuer persecuteth the carnal man, but forgeueth him. who / 
by their cruel tiranny / hath enforced
so many notable members of Christ / 
(leauinge wife / children / kinsfolke / 
Landes and goodes) either to flye into
straunge realmes / or els from town
to town / from Citie to Citie: onelye
beecause they woulde not drynke of
the venemous cuppe of the whore of
Babylon?Hier. ad Gala. iiii. who hath wrought al these
wickednesses / but onelye the mitered
prelates and their popishe priestes? If
we shal alow thē for the true church
of god / that appeare to bee the visible
and outwarde churche / consistyng of
the ordinarye succession of Bishops:
then shal we make Christ / whiche is
an innocent lambe without spot / and
in whom is founde no gile / to bee the
head of vngodly and disobediēt members.Exo. xii. i. Pet. ii. d
Which thing is as impossyble / as
to make god / which is onli good / and
nothynge but goodnesse it selfe / to bee
the aucthor / originall / and cause of al
euill. For Chryste / as he is pure / holy
and perfyte: euen so must his churche

and members be / to whom he (as the
head) is adioyned and coupled.Eph. 1. d. Collos. 1. But if
we alow the Pope / hys Cardinales / 
Bishops / Priestes / Mōkes / Chanō
               
                  •
                /
Friers / and the whole rable of the clergye / 
to be thys perfect church of god / 
whose doinges are cleane contrarye
(for the most parte) to the wyll / and
commaundement of Chryst / lefte and
expressed in his woorde wrytten: then
make we him a synner / and his word
of none effecte. For as swete agreeth
wyth sower / blacke with white / darknes
with light / and euil with good: euen
so this outward / seene and vysyble
churche / consisting of the ordinari
succession of Bishops / agreeth wyth
Christe. But there they wyll aske me / 
how shal a man know whether he be
in the right faith / but by this church?
To this Christe shal make aunswere
himselfe / sayeng in the gospel of Iohn / 
my shepe heare my voice / and shal not
heare a straunger.Iohn. 10. And where (I pray
you) hath Christe left any voyce to be
heard or folowed / but in hys woorde

writtē? Search the scriptures / saith
he:Iohn. 5. for they beare witnes of me. Wher
he biddeth you not search vnwritten
verities / such as the outward / sene
and pompeous church shall of theyr
own heades showe you / but the written
verities / contained in the holye
scriptures / whiche are profytable to
teache / to improue / to amende / and to
instructe in righteousnesse / that the
man of god may be perfet / and prepared
vnto all good workes.2. Tim. 3.
            
            If thou therefore bee desyerous to
knowe whether thou be in the righte
fayth or no / seke it not at mās mouth:Psa. 116. c Goddes word only certifyeth a man whether his fayth be good or no.
for all men bee lyers. Seke it not (I
saye) at a proude / gloryous / and waue
ringe sorte of Bishoppes / & priestes:
but at gods owne mouth / whyche is
his holy worde written / whiche can
neither lye / disceaue / nor be disceaued.
As

                (I say) seke / and knocke by dylygent

who hath promised to geue to al thē / 
that aske faithfulli of him the certaīti
of good faith in their cōsciēce / taught &

confirmed by the holye scryptures of
the olde and newe testament. And here
I forbid no man as though they shold
not aske and learne of the learned:
for that is good and necessarye / yea
and alowed by gods trueth / but thys
would I haue all men to dooe / to vse
discretion / and wysdome in this matter:Trie euery spirite but alow none further then thei agree with the written scriptures.
and to knowe whether they be lerned / 
godli minded / and able to instruct
by the scriptures or no. And yet if thei
be / beleue them no further / then they
can shewe their doctryne and exhortacion
to bee agreable wyth the true
worde of god written. For that is the
very touche stone / whiche must / yea
and also wyl / trye all doctryne or learnyng
whatsoeuer it be / whether it be
good or euill / true or false.Goddes word trieth all thynges whether they be good or badde. And let not
men of small learninge be to curious
in askyng or mouing darke and doubtful
questions / whiche brede contenciō
rather then godly edyfieng but lette
them be contente with the plaine and
open places of the scriptures. Let thē
rather be earnest to obserue the commaundementes

of faythe and loue / 
whiche are plainly set forth in Gods
boke / then to trouble themselues / and
busy their heades wyth darke places:
for that is a thyng that hath done / 
and also doth displease god very greatly.
Yea I thinke surely / that these heauy
plagues / where wyth god most iustly
punisheth now this realme of Englande
(whyche I beseche hym of hys
infinite mercy eyther to take cleane awaye / 
or els to mitigate them for his
electe sake) commeth not so much for
the simple / innocente / and vnlearned

of the wilie papystes / doe stil cō

in supersticion and Idolatrye:
but rather for the curious sort / which
preache straunge & farre fetched doctrynes / 
nothyng so muche to edyfieng
as to contencyous brawlynge. Yea I
would to god there were not a greate
nomber of them / that were and are
counted learned / whiche preache and
defende doctrines / whiche themselues

know to be vntrue / & cōtrary to the euidēt
scriptures. Wolde god ther wer
not many hūdreds of great gospellers
sometimes / that had not subscribed
with their own hāds & confirmed by
their opē & publique sermōs, the cōtrary
of that / which they once builded in
Chryst. And some of such (I know) in
perswading priuatlye with their olde
frēds, & acquaītaūce / haue cōfessed no
lesse / but that they haue done cōtrary
to the truth / & the good perswatiō of
their own cōsciēce:Their cō
                  sciences shal therfore cnodēne thē for so doing, if they repent not in tyme. & yet the same mē

it a mā to winne al the world &
lose his own soule? For he that loueth
his own life more thē me (saith christ)
is not worthy of me.Math. 16 For these mēs sakes
therfore / that is to saye / the stubburne

for thys we know / that god suffereth

But lette vs once agayne come to the
new testament. Did not the head rulers
of the churche / with the aucthoritie
of Herode and Pilate / condemne
Chryst and his doctrine as erronious
and sedicious:Math. 26 Math. 27 & al the people folowed
and cried Crucifige? Did not all the
Emperours before Constantine / beeing
seduced by their Byshoppes and
priestes / condemne Chrystian religion
as hereticall / sedicious / & trayterous / 
& for the same murthered many thou
sandes of martirs? When Constantyne
was christened / the was the true
religion first set forth and openly preached
by publique aucthoritie: and yet
in the space betwene Chryste and this
Godlye Emperoure / God was not
wythoute hys churche / though it wer
not knowē / sene and so accepted of the
worlde. In thys Prynces tyme / and

by his aucthorite / was kept the firste
and best general coūsel of Nice: where
was set forth our common Crede / containing
shortly the chefe and most necessary
articles of our belief. Thys cō
               stantinus
sonne Constantius / fauoryng
the errour of the Arriās / in the
counsell of Arimine / decreed that
Chryste was not GOD / but man
onely.Theodoriti. lib. 2 cap. 18.
            
            And then to call Chryste the sonne
of God / was by the vtwarde knowē
churche and by a general counsel / condemned
for an haynous heresie. From
that tyme forth whē Panim prynces
reygned / Idolatrye and worshippynge
of false gods was the publike doctrī
When heretiques reigned and bare the
rule heresye was openly preached for
gods trueth.The priestes for the most part wer double faced, turne tippettes and flatteres▪
                When the Emperoures
were Catholike / then was the true
doctrin of the gospel opēli preached.
And generally / suche as was the faith
of the Emperoures / kynges / or other
rulers such did the priests preach. And
if anibi the autorite of gods word preched

thē contrary, or withstode their
corrupt teachynges / straight way he
was either deposed from his offyce / 
condēned for an heretique / bani
                  ••
               ed / 
brent / or put to some other cruel death
After all these spronge vp the Pope / 
that triple crowned monster & greate
Antichrist / whiche toke vpon hym authoritie / 
not onely ouer the Cleargy / 
but also clymed aboue kinges and Emperours / 
deposing thē at his pleasure / 
and setled him selfe in the tēple of god / 
that is / in the conseyences of men / exrolling
himselfe aboue God / dispensīg
wyth godes lawes / and geuynge men
leaue to breake them / and to regarde
more his decrees / thē the euerlastynge
commaundementes of god. And so it
came to passe in tyme / that to eat flesh
on the frydaye / or fasting dai / was coū
               ted
greater sinne thē brōkenes / adultery
or periurie. And whi / because his
lawes were diligentlyer and more
strayghtly loked to / and the offenders
thereof sorer punished / then Goddes
lawes. Sence this Antichrist of Rome

(I saye) was stablished in his full power / 
what soeuer pleased hym / that
was takē for gods law / and that was
decreed vpon by generall counsel / confirmed / 
and ratified by whole heapes
of clearkes. To speake agaynste that
was / and also now is / detestable heresy
/ and so heinous a cryme against the
holy gost (if it wer true that they say)
that it can not be forgeuen / eyther in
thys worlde / or in the world to come.
He that speaketh agaynste any of hys
decrees / must vtterly be cōdemned for
an heritike / accursed of god / and damned
into hell for euer without redēption:These be the Popes thunder bolts wherewith he feareth the people, and maketh them to incline to his waies.
except he recant / abiure / and de / 
ny the trueth / and set forth error and
false doctrine / and promise wyth a solemne
Oth / that he shal neuer preach
teache / nor defende the trueth hereafter.
Nowe let vs come to oure dayes.

A simple laye man / bryngynge
forth the scriptures / is to be beleued / 
rather then an hole counsel. For a
counsell may erre / as it hath afore tymes
erred / as did the counsell of Melchildense
and Aquisgranum of contracting
of Matrimonie. The councel

of Cōstance among other articles
of Iohn Husband Hierome of Prage / 
vniustly condemned / condemned also
this article for heresye: that the two
natures (that is) the diuinite and humanitie
be one Chryst / whych is a necessarye
article of our fayth / expressed
in the Crede of Athanasius called qui
cunque vult / where it is red:Read the Psalme. the right
fayth is / that we beleue and confesse / 
that our Lorde Iesus Chryst the sōne
of god is god and mā / and a litle after:
lyke as the reasonable soule and the
flesh is one man / so god and mā is one
Christ: the same is also decreed by the
counsell of Nice and dyuerse other catholike
counsels / and it is the doctrine
of the churche at thys tyme. Finally it
may be proued by the expresse word of
god / and yet these malycyous cleargy
were not ashamed to condemne the
same for an heresy. Note here iētle reader / 
vnto what shameles and detestable
heresyes theyr Popishe / yea Antichristian
general counsels haue fallē / 
of the which they boast so much / that

they cannot erre / and wherevpon chē
                  fely
they builde al their errours and
heresyes. Moreouer the most part of
the good lawes and Canons be in maner
altogether abrogated and no wher
kept: part wherof I shall expresse.
               
                  ¶Canons
of the Apostles and counsels
not kept nor vsed.
                  CAnone .3. Let not a Byshoppe / 
priest or deacon / by any meanes
put away his owne wife vnder
pretence of relygion: but if he doe / let
hym be excommunicated: and if he so
continew / let hym be deposed.
                  CAnone. 4. Let no Byshoppe / 
Pryest or deacon be receaued in
to another Byshoppes diocese / 
wythoute a testymoniall of his good
behaueour: and when they haue deliuered
their writinges / let them be diligently

examined if they be godly preachers.
¶If these .ii. lawes wer
throughly executed by indifferent iudges / 
beyng no Priestes / the realme of
England should not swarme so ful of
runnagates / adulterous and sodomicall
Pryestes. For in wales / for theyr
cradel crounes payde to the ordynary / 
they kepte theyr cōcubines or harlets
openly: and in Englande many greate
benefyced men kepe theyr harlettes
at racke and maunger without any punishment / 
excepte it be by brybyng of
the ordinaryes priuely: and all shame
sette asyde / they haue their own knowen
bastards wayting vpon them in
sighte of the whole worlde. But the
poore purgatorie Priestes / when thei
be taken in open aduoutrie / flee from
easte to weste / from north to southe / 
frō diocese to diocese / and there be receaued
wythoute any letters testimoniall
at al: where they be taken for honeste
and chaste Priestes. But if the
riche Priests wer depriued of al their

promotions / so oft as they be knowē
to be fornicators (as they ought to be)
and the poore priestes not receaued into
any straūge diocese / without testymonye
of his honeste demeanure / frō
his former ordinary: you shold skarcely
fynde Priestes for euery thirde benefice
of Englande / and the Pryestes
themselues would be the firste earnest
suters / that they mighte haue their
lawfull wyues of their own: but as
long as they be their owne iudges (according
to the olde prouerbe / one skabbed
horse gnappeth an other) what
for fauour and frendshippe / what for
moeny and for slaunderynge of theyr
order: they wynke one at anothers
faultes / and helpe to cloke the same in
so much / that within my memorye / 
whiche is aboue. xxx. yeares / and also
by enformacion of other / that be .xx.

                        neth no priest, be his crime neuer so openlye knowen I coulde neuer perceaue
or learne / that any one Priest / 
vnder the Popes kyngdome / was euer
punished for aduoutrye by his ordinary.
And yet not long ago / a Petye

canon of a Cathedrall church in Englande
was accused of buggerye / by .iii.
boyes of the grāer schole / to the vicedeane
or subdeāe of the same church / 
a man not vnlyke to a monke called
Iodocus: of whō Erasmus maketh
mencion / that he wer worthy to walk
openly with a bell and a cocks combe / 
if he were not set forth vnder the holy
habit of a mōke. But when he perceaued / 
that the sayd Pryest could not
pourge himself of the foresayd crime / 
he priuely payed him his quarters wages
before hande / and suffered hym to
departe without farther tryall of the
sayd cryme: and now he ietteth in lō
                     don / 
wyth side gown and sarcenet typet / 
as good a virgin priest as the best.
If I should but brefely touch al the histories / 
that I haue knowen of the incontinency
of Pryests / it wold grow
to a worke thryse greater / then al my
whole boke / and it would make some
of the proudeste of them to blushe / if
they be not past all shame: but I wyll
not blot my good paper with so euyll

matter: although thei be not ashamed
openly to blot and stayne their owne
good names with crimes / worthy of
such reproche and ignominy.
                  LEt not any Byshoppe / Pryest or

they maye easely allure menne / they

chefely they deceaue men in their oracles
and answers / whose Iuglynges
vngodly men cannot discerne frō the
trueth. Therefore they thynke / that
Empiers and victories / ryches and
lucky chaunces of thinges / are geuen

common welthes to be deliuered frō
present daungers at their beck / which
daungers they both declared by their

be but deceites: for seyng they knowe
before the disposicion of god / because
they were his ministers / they thruste
them selues into these businesses / so
that what so euer thynges eyther be
done / or haue bene done of God / they
mighte seme cheflye to dooe or haue

               And so ofte as any goodnesse is cō

accordynge to Gods appointmēt / 

they promyse that they wyll doe it / eyther

thynges beeyng geuen / whan that

get to themselues greate worshyppe.
For this cause bee temples vowed / for
thys cause be newe Images halowed.
And so ofte as perilles be at hande /

they fayne themselues angrye: as Iuno

               And if it cannot be eschewed / thys
they doe / that it myghte appeare to

this / that whosoeuer is dead / is a seruaūt.
But what the scripturs speak / 
the lorde himselfe speaketh: therfore
though a dead mā arise / yea although
an angel cōe down frō heauē / yet chiefly
we ought to beleue the scryptures.

For he / that is master of Aungels / and
lord of the quicke and the dead made
them. If dead men should come again
from thence vnto vs / the deuil might
haue brought to vs false doctrines:
and that very easely. For he myghte

haue subornated men / that shold coū
                  terfet

is done in dede / yet dreames sene of many

haue deceyued / destroyed / and ouer

it should haue chaunced / if the thynge

if many of the dead had returned againe
to lyfe / that wycked deuil wold
haue wroughte innumerable deceits / 
and brought muche fraude into the

life of men.The dead neuer returne after the death to tel their state that be dead. And for that cause God
hath shut vp that waye / neyther doth
he suffer any of the dead to come againe
hether to tel what is done ther:
lest he by that meanes should brynge
in al his wiles and subtilties. For whē

that dead mennes soules worke wyth
them / how shal they make me beleue
that? because thou haste heard dead
mens soules many times crye / I am
the soule of such a one. Yea but these
wordes procede out of the fraude and
deceit of the deuil. For it is not the
dead mans soule / that sayth this / but
the deuill that sayneth thys / that he
maye deceaue the hearers. For these
ought to be taken as olde wyues fables / 
the wordes of liars / and fraye

soule / beyng departed from the body / 
walke in this earth. For the soules of
the righteous are in the hand of god / 
and the soules of synners ar streight / 
after their death / caried awai. Which
is manifest by Lazarus and the ryche
man. The lord saieth also in another
place: this day shal they fetche away
thy soule. The soule therfore / after it
be departed from the body / cannot wā
                  der

by maniscripturs / that the souls
of the ryghteous cannot wander here
after their death.

my spirite. And Paule desyered to be
losed from the bodye / and to be wyth

harken to the ryche manne / what he
sayeth: consyder what he asketh / and
obtayneth not. But yf mens soules

woulde haue come as he desyered /

the tormentes in hell.
               Of the whiche place of Scripture
it is manyfeste / that after the departynge

caryed into a certayne place, from

pleasure: but loke for that terrible day
of Iudgement.

set forth his churche / biddinge repentaunce

he opened their wittes that
they mighte vnderstande the Scryptures /

Prophetes and all the scripturs / that
were wrytten of hym. And after the

We must (saith he) vse tradicions: for
all thynges can not bee perceyued by

Apostles haue set furth vnto vs some
thynges by the worde of god / and sōe
thynges by tradicions / as the Apostle
sayth: as I haue deliuered vnto you / 
thus I teache / and thus I haue deliuered
in all churches / and thus you remēber
by what meanes I haue preached
vnto you / except you haue beleued
in vayne.

appeare to euery indifferēt reader / 
that is not blinded of malice to resyst

And wheras they say / that thīgs /

well to bee beleued / as those / that bee

wrytten: they meane that they are
worthy of lyke credite wyth tradycyons

Of those doctrines / that ar preached
in the churche / we haue sōe
deliuered vs by writing / and agayne / 
some we haue receiued by the tradicions
of the Apostles in mysteri that is
in secret: both haue lyke strengthe to
godlynes / nother doth any mā speake
against these / whatsoeuer he be / that
hath but meane experience what the
authorite of the churche is. For if we
(lyke fooles) goe about to reiecte the
customes of the church / which ar not
written / as thynges of small weyght:
we shall condemne those thyngs / that
be nedeful for our saluation in the gospell.
Yea we shall rather cut short the
true preachyng of fayth to bare name.

Tertullian did.

Although there were no authorite
of the scriptures at all / yet the
consent of the whole worlde / in thys
matter / shold haue the force of a law.
For many other thynges / whiche are
obserued in the Churche by tradiciō / 
haue obteyned the authorite of a law
written: as to dyppe the head thrise in
baptisme: and when they are chrystened
/ to geue them first pappe made of
milke with hony / for a signification of
their infancie: on the Sondaye / and
all Whytsone weake / not to knele at
their prayers.
               AVgustine vpon the wordes of
Basile. Some of the ecclesiasticall
institucions we haue receued
by writinges: some through
tradicions from the Apostles / approued
by successiosn: and some vse hath

alowed / being strengthned by custōe.
Vnto all which lyke vsage and lyke
affectyōs of godlines is due. of which
who wil doubt / though he haue but
small experiences in the scriptures?
For if we set out mynd to regard light
lycustomes of the churche / delyuered
vs from our elders without the scriptures:
it shall easelye appeare to them
that loke earnestly theron / how great
losse Christen religion shall suffer.
And he reciteth the same that Ierome
doeth / wyth diuerse other.
               THese .iii.Answere authors / and all that
make for the same purpose / bee
answered before in Tertullian.
For not one of those thyngs / that they
make mencion of / are necessary for our
saluacion: and many of them are now
taken away: and the reste / whiche yet
remayne (as to dippe the childe thrise
wholly in the water: to hallowe the
water / oyle / and creame: or to crosse it
in the forthead) are not of necessite to
saluatiō. For Iohn Baptised in Iordā
                  
and the Chāberlaine of the Quene of
Ethiopia was Christened in the commō
streame / & chrildrē in daūger of life
are Christened of the midwife / or sōe
other womā / without any of these ceremonies:
& yet thei wil not deni that
al these baptismes be good / & alowed
of god. In Spaine also thei dippe the
child but once / as it was decreed in the
coūcell of Tollet. And I am suer / they
wil not say that al the Spaniardes / so
many yeres / haue wanted a thing necessary
to saluatiō in their baptisme.
God also regardeth not our outward
bodely gesture in oure praiers: but he
beholdeth the fayth / & earnest desier
of the hart of him that prayeth / wher
soeuer he prayeth / & what soeuer hys

               By the which he proueth / that the

except a man be borne againe / to

be spoken also of infantes. What maner
of argumente shoulde thys be of
Austen
                     •
                   The exposition of the scrypture / 
and the vse of the Sacraments / 
may be iudged by the custome vsed in
the holye churche alwaye: ergo the
church may make a newe sacrament / 
and ordeine any newe Article of oure
fayth without the scripture. By the
sētences before cited of Austē himself / 
it may be easely iudged. I also graunt
that euery exposiciō of the scripture / 
wherein soeuer the olde / hole & true
churche dyd agree is necessarye to be
beleued. But oure controuersye here
is / whether any thynge ought to be be
leued of necessite / without the scripture.
               THe same against the Epistle of
Fundament Cap. 5. tomo. 6.argumēt
I would not beleue the gospel / 
but that the authorite of the
churche moueth me. Ergo (say they)
what soeuer the church saith / we must

nedes beleue them / as wel as the gospell.
This argumente is naughte. For
the testimonye of the churche is but
as a publicke office of a record / as the
exchequer / the court of the rolles / the
office of a recorder / or a regester of all
Christendome: in whiche office menne
maye searche and haue / of the keepers
of such offices / the true copies of such
lands / or other moueables / as be due
to them by the lawe. And yet may nether
the Regesters / Recorders / Stcwardes
of courtes / or towne clarkes
put to / or take awaye any thing from
the firste originall writinges / no nor
the iudge himselfe.
               But all thynges oughte to be iudged
by those writings. So likewise we
beleue the holy Canon of the byble / 
because that the Primitiue churche
of the Apostles / and eldest wryters / &
nexte to their time / approued them in
their regester: that is / in their wrytinges / 
whyche partlye sawe them / &
partlye hearde them of the Apostles.
And more receue we not / because these

olde fathers of the firste churche testifie
in their bokes / that there was no
more then these required to be beleued
as the scripture of god. And yet were
these wrytynges no lesse true / afore
they were alowed by them / thē sence / 
Christe witnessing and saying: I seke
no witnesse of man.

thynges / wherein the scripture
of god hath determined nothīg / 
the custome of the people / and
our elders ordinaunces / oughte to be
holden as a law: and the trāsgressors
of the customes of the churche at like
wyse to be punished / as the breakers
of gods law.
               Of which thinges if thou wylte dispute / 
and reproue one custome by another:
there shal aryse an endlesse strife.
He repeteth also this sentence manye
tymes: that what so euer is vniuersally
obserued & not writtē in the scripture / 
nor ordained by general coūcels:
is a tradiciō come from the Apostles.
               
                  
ANswere him as Tertullyan: &
yet of all other authors he is
most playne / that nothing is of
necessite to saluacion / besydes
the Scriptures of God.Answere But let vs
graunt for their pleasures / that those
customes / whiche they speake of / bee
tradiciōs Apostolyke: yet they bee no
longer nor other waies to be obserued / 
then the tradiciōs Apostolike writtē.
Which / as is before fully proued / mai
(and are already) be both chaunged / &
clearly taken awaye. And as concernyng
custome it is playnlye proued / 
that it is not to be receaued agaynste
the Scrypture / trueth / or reason.
               THey sai moreouer that the perpetuall
virginite of our Lady
is to be beleued of necessite / as
Ciprian / Chrisostome / Ierome / Ambrose / 
Austen / and all other speakyng
therof say. But this is not founde in
the scripture: ergo there is some thīg
to be beleued that is not written in the

Scripture.
               THe minor / that is to say / that
thys is not written in the scripture / 
is false.Answere For firste none of
the old authours / that rehearce tradiciōs
of the Apostles vnwrytten / make
mencion of the perpetual virginite of
our ladye / to be one of them: but they
rehearce only diuerse cerimonies / or
bodelye gestures / and suche rites vsed
in Baptisme / prayers / holy dayes and
fastynges / which (as I haue manyfestly
declared) are not necessary to saluacyon.
But the most part of them are
cleane taken away / and the contrarye
commaunded / and vsed by the vniuersall
churche. Moreouer all the sayed
authours proue her perpetuall virginite
by thys texte of Scripture.
               EZechiell. 44. Thys doore shalbe
styll shutte / and not opened for
any man to goe thorowe it: but

only for the Lord god of Israel / yea he
shall goe thorowe it / els shal it be shut
still. For if these / and suche other fathers / 
had not iudged her perpetuall
virginite to haue been wrytten in the
scriptures: they woulde neuer haue
iudged it to haue bene a thing to be beleued
vnder payne of damnacyon.
               Sainct Ierome also calleth Heluidiū
a rashe / and an vngodly man: because
that he taught / that our Ladye hadde
other children by Ioseph after Christs
birth / which doctrine he coulde not
proue by the scriptures of god. In like
maner we cal al them / that preache a
ny doctrine in the church without the
Authorite of gods worde / both vngodly / 
rashe and wicked members of Antichrist.
               ARgument.argumēt Yet they bring forth
to maintaine their errour the
Baptisme of infantee / which
(they say) is not contained in the scriptures:
and yet this is to be obserued vpō
paine of dānaciō / of the said childrē
Ergo there is sōe thyng to be done of

necessite to our saluacion / that is not
contained in the scriptures.
               ON what a gappe these men open
both to the Donatistes & to the
Anabaptists / that deny the baptising
of infantes.Answere For if it were not
writtē in the worde of god / no manne
ought to beleue it or vse it. And so the
Donatistes & Anabaptistes doctryne
were true / & outs false. But in dede
the baptisme of infaūtes is proued by
the playne scriptures. Firste by the figure
of the old law / which was circū
                  cisiō.
Infātes in the olde law were circūcised:
Ergo in the newe lawe they
ought to be baptised. Againe: Infātes
pertaine to god / as it is said to Abrahā
I wil be thy god / & the god of thy sede
after thee.Gene. 17 Christ saith also: suffer children
to come to me / for of such is the
kingdome of heauen.Math. 19. And agayne: see
that ye despice not one of these lytle
ones:Luke. 19. for their Aūgels in heauen alwayes

Paule sayth / that youre children art

playne wordes of Scripture it is euidente / 
that the Baptysme of infantes
is grounded vpon the holye
scriptures.
               FVrthermore the churche / saye
they / hath chaunged the Sabboth
daye into the Sondaye / 
whych Sabboth was commaunded
by God / and neuer man found fault
there at.argumēt Seeyng thē that the church
hath authorite to chaunge Goddes
lawes: muche more it hath authorite
to make newe lawes necessarie to saluacion.
               THere bee. 2. partes of the Sabboth
day. One is the outward
bodely reste from all maner of
labour and worke: and this is were
ceremoniall / and was taken awaye
with other sacrifices and ceremonies

by Christ at the preaching of the gospell.
The other part of the Sabboth
day is the inwarde rest or ceassing frō
sinne / from our own wils and lusts / 
and to do only gods wil and commaū
                  dementes.
               Of this part speaketh the Prophet
Esai.Esai. 56. He / that taketh hede that he vnhalow
not the sabboth day / is he / that
kepeth himselfe that he doe no euyl:
and they that hold greatly of the thing
that pleaseth me / and kepe my couenaūte / 
vnto them wil I geue an euerlastyng
name / that shall not peryuse.
And moreouer the same Prophete
sayeth.Esai. 58. If thou turne thy feete from
the sabboth / so that thou doe not the
thing / which pleaseth thy selfe / in my
holy daye: Then shalte thou be called
vnto the pleasaunt / holy and gloryous
sabboth of the Lorde / where thou
shalte be in honor / so that thou do not
after thine own imaginacions / nether
seke thine own wil / nor speake thyne
owne wordes. Then shalt thou haue
thy pleasure in the Lord, whiche shall

carry the hyghe aboue the earth / and
fede thee with the heritage of Iacob
thy father: for the Lords own mouth
hath spoken it. This spirituall Sabboth / 
that is / to abstayne from synne
and to doe good / are all men bounde
to kepe all the dayes of their life / and
not only on the sabboth day. And this
spirituall sabboth may no man alter
nor chaung / no not the whole church.
That the vtter obseruinge of the sabboth
is mere cerimonial / sainct Paul
writeth plainly: as that the holy daies
of the newe mone and of the sabboth
daies are nothinge but shadowes of
thinges to come.To lanuarye epist. 119. The bodely rest on the sabboth day is figuratiuely to be kepte.
               
               And that the outwarde bodely rest
is a mere cerimoniall precept S. Austine
also affirmeth / saying that amōg
all the ten commaundements / this only / 
that is spoken of the sabboth / is cō
                  maūded
figuratiuely: but al the other
commaundements we must obserue
playnly / as they be cōmaunded / with
out any figuratyue speche.

hath been mostcruelly persecuted vnto
death / with prison / famine / water /

him to death on the crosse: In lyke maner / 
I say / the Pope and the Turke
do fully agree in this one poynt / to
persecute and murther Christ in hys
faythfull members. For as the sonne
can not be withoute hys brightnesse / 
nor the fier without his heat: so cannot
the true churche of God / be long

witnesseth S. Paule: al they that wil

liue godly in Iesus Chryste shal suffer
persecucion. And our sauiour Christ
sayeth plainly / that his kingdome is
not of this world.
               For if they persecute me (sayeth he)
they shal also persecute you:Christes bage. & Chryste
geueth not to his Apostles earthlye
peace in this world / but peace and quietnesse

churche of Chryste can neuer be long
wythout persecution: in lyke maner
can the false churche of Sathan / and
Antichriste / neuer ceasse from persecutynge / 
as it appeareth throughe oute
the Historyes of the whole byble. Of
the tyrannye / and crueltye of Antichrist
in persecutyng of Chrystes true
church / prophesied Daniel lōg before:Dani. 7.
speaking of the Empire and regiment

of Rome.The mark to knowe antichrist by, is to preuaill (by persecucion) againste gods elect saints Daniel. 8. And the marke of the true churche is to be persecuted of Antichriste. The .4. beast (saith he) shalbe
the .iiii. kyngdome / whyche shal be
greater then all other kyngdomes: it
shall deuoure / treade downe and destroye
all other landes / he shal speake
wordes agaynst the higheste of all▪ he
shal destroye the sainctes of the moste
highest / and thinke that he can chaūge
tymes and lawes: & agayne he saieth
of Antiochus / which was a figure of
Antichrist: there shall aryse a king vn
shamfast of face / he shalbe wise in dark
speakyng / he shalbe mightie and strōg / 
but not in his own strēgth / he shal destroye

and through his craftines falseheade
shall prosper in his hande / and manye
one shall he put to death in his weal
thynes: he shall stande vp agaynst the
Prince of Princes / but he shalbe slain
without hande. Of the tyrannye and
prosperous successe of antichrist in slaying
of the sayuctes of god / and the rewarde

of them that bee slaine for the
witnes of gods trueth / speaketh also
sainct Iohn in the .vi. Chapter of his
Apocalips / vnder the openyng of the
iiii.Read the places. and .v. seales: and in the .xvii. chapter / 
he lyuely setteth foorth the Pope
in his own colours / vnder the person
of the whore of Babilon / being dronken
with the bloud of saynctes: pointyng
as it were with his finger who
thys whore of Babilon is / and the
place wher she shal reigne / saying: the
woman / whiche thou sawest / is that
greate citie / which reigneth ouer the
kyngs of the earth. Now what other
citie reigned at that tyme or at any
tyme since vnder the Christian kings
of the earth / but only Rome: Wherof
it foloweth Rome to bee the seate of
Antichrist / and the Pope to be verye
Antichrist himselfe. I could proue the
same by many other scriptures / olde
wryters & strong reasons. But for as
muche as Rodulphe Gualter hath
writtē herof a notable worke in Latē / 
& now of Laten translated into Englishe

by I. O. I remit the reader to
his boke / wherin he may be fully satisfied
herof. Of the prosperite and securite / 
that the false churche hath in
worldlye pleasures / vsynge the same
with al gredines & voluptuousnes of
carnal lustes / with the wicked deuices
of tiranny against Christ and his true
members / wherwith the vngodly daily
persecute and murther gods electe
for his trueth / wyth the rewarde also
of them that suffer for the same truth
sake: it is most playnly wrytten in the
ii.Read the Chapters and .iii. Chapters of the booke of
wisdome.
               By these scriptures now rehersed
it appeareth most plainly / that worldly
prosperite of the Pope and his clargy
proue not the trueth of their doctryne:
nor yet persecutyon of Goddes
true preachers / and other faythfull
people / argueth their doctrine to bee
false. But if thou wilt nedes knowe
where the true churche of Chryst is &
where the false / and not be deceyued:
herin take this for a plaine and ful answer / 

that wheresoeuer the worde of
god is truly preached without addiciō
of mans doctrines and tradiciōs / and
the sacramentes duly ministred according
to Christs institucion / ther is the
true church / the very spouse of god / 
Christ bēig the head therof. But how
many / and who of that nomber / that
heare the word of god / and receiue the
sacramentes / be gods elect and church
and true mēbers of Chryst / is knowē
to god onelye. For the Lorde knoweth
who he his / and no man can tell / of
an other man / whether he be worthy
loue or hatred / although their works
seme neuer so holy and gloryous afore
men / so great a wytch is Ipocrisie.

this and that saincte / to bee done for
them / and they shoulde be delyuered
from the fier of purgatorye / where
the paynes be greater (say they) than
mans wit can comprehende. And whā
suche masses / pilgrimages with offringes
to suche sainctes reliques and
images be done for them / they appear
to the same persons agayne / sayinge / 
that by suche meanes they be deliuered
out of purgatory into the eternal
ioyes of heauen: they tel also of many
wonders and straunge miracles / to
proue their doctrine / in all these afore
sayed thynges / to be true. And because

they haue great profyte and aduaūtage
therby / they (counting gains
godlynes) haue fylled all theyr bookes
with suche vanites and lyes: of which
some be so fonde / & so directly againste
gods glory / that the most earneste papistes
(hauing either learnyng or wit)
be ashamed of thē. Yea and the pope
himselfe hath cleane put them out of
gods seruice / vsed in the churche of
Rome: and yet must we reade them / 
beleue them as necessarye articles of
our fayth / or els burne therfore lyke
heretikes.
               BY thē manifest and plaine words
of the Scriptures / and the consent
of the most auncyente authours
before written / it is euydente / 
that neither the visions of Aungels / 
apparitions of the dead / nor miracles
nor all these together ioyned in one / 
are able or sufficient to make anye one
newe article of our fayth / or stablyshe
any thyng in religion / wythout the expresseAnswere

such thyngs (as is before proued) may

sake) done by the power of the

hipocrites.

About fourtene yeares paste
at Orleāce in Fraunce the Profestes
wife died / willing to beburied at the
friers in the same citie / without pōpe
or other solemnite cōmonly vsed at burialles.
Wherfore the friers / fearinge

to lease a great pray / if this shoulde be
suffered to enter into the heades of
the people / caused a younge frier to
speake in a vawte in a womās voice / 
many people hearinge it: & sayd that
she was the soule of the Profests wife
condemned in hell for contemnyng of
the suffrages of the holy churche / commaunding
also her body to be cast out
of Christian buriall. But the profeste
so boolted out the mater / that the yōg
frier confessed the place and the maner
of his speaking: and all the friers
were openly punished for that fault / 
in the common market at Orleance.
But let vs come home to oure owne
realme of Englande. About .xxx. yers
paste in the borders of wales / wythin
a Priory called Lymster / there
was a younge woman called the holy
maide of Lymster: whiche / as the fāe
was / lyued onely by Aungels foode / 
and was enclosed wythin a grate
of Irone. Vnto whom certain daies / 
when the Prior of the place sayede
masse / the thirde parte of the hoste

went hanging in the ayer (by miracle / 
as it semed) from the aulter / wher the
Prior massed / into the maids mouth:
whiche thing broughte the people into
a great opinion of holynes in her / 
and caused great pilgrimage to be ther
vsed. But when the Lord of Burgauenny,
with his brother sir Edward

                     •
                  euel and diuerse other ientle men &
ientle wemē / came to trye the trueth
her of: thei caused the doore to be opened / 
and strayghte wayes the dogges
fought for bones / that wer vnder her
bedde. Whervpon they / searching farther / 
founde a priuye doore / whereby
the Prior myght resort to her and she
to hym / at their pleasures. And then
the confessed that she made (as it wer)
.ii. fine thredes of her own heres sīgly
tyed together wyth fyne knottes:
and then made a bigge hole with a bed
kin / thorowe the corner of a quarter
of the hoste / and fastened one ende of
the sayed heere to the corporas / 
where the sayed Prior sayd masse / 
and the other ende to her own bedde / 

wherein the laye: & tyed the other heer
faste to the quarter of the hoste / and
wrapped the other ende aboute her
own finger. And whē the Prior had
receiued his porcion of the hoste / she
wōde vy the threde (wherto the hoste
was tyed) vpon her fingers / and so
cōueyed the ost into her mouth. Thys
both the Prior and she confessed / and
dyd open penaunce for the same. To
Sainct Albans / about .xxviii. yeares
past / came a mayde / crepyng vpon her
knees and lening vpon .ii. short staues
enquiring after Sainct Albās bōes / 
affirminge that she shoulde bee made
whole and goe vpright / so sone as she
should come to the place / where saīct
Albans bones were. In token wherof
an Aungell had deliuered her a keye / 
wherby she should certenlye knowe
where his verye bones were. And
when she passed thus throughe the
streates of Sainct Albans creping on
her knees till she came to Sainte Albans
shrine / after she had made her
prayers deuoutly there / she toke out

the key of her purse / whiche she sayed
an Angel had deliuered to her: and thē
she stode vpright & opened the shrine
with the sayd key / and then kneled agayne
to pray and to geue thankes to
god and sainct Albāe for her healing &
geuing her strēgth to walke / whiche
was borne lāe. And by & the mōkes
would haue had it rōge for a miracle:
but some wiser men thought it mete
to trye the matter better & to examine
her further / before they tēpted to rīge
a miracle op̄enly. And vpon her examinacion / 
the sayd that she had bene

she dayly and holyly visited saynct Albans
shrine. But the night before the
returne of the messengers she was conueyed
awaye and neuer hearde of nor

seen after. And the messengers declared
to be lies al that euer she had said:
for there was neuer none borne lame /

in Cātorbury / stept into the pulpit in

by gods body is it / quoth he: & because
that nether oth nor periury can proue
a good argumēt / he proued the same by
three notable miracles. The first of an
horse / refusing to eat wafers so lōg / as
their cakye god was amōg thē: the. 2.
by the deuil speaking in the likenes of
an horse / being cōiured of a Prieste by
gods body to tel what he was: and the
3. a maide of Northgate parish in Cā
                  terburi / 
who he said in pretēce to wipe
her mouth kept the ost in her hādkercher.
And whē she cāe hōe / she put the
sāe īto a pot close couerd & spitted ī an

other pot: and after a few dayes she / 
loking in the one pot / founde a lytle
young prety babe / about a shaftmond
long / and the other potte was full of
gored bloud. Here is goodly pulpit
matters to proue new articles of our
fayth. For if the Priestes / that tolde
the stories of the 2. horses / or the maid
that sayd that the bread was turned
into a litle childe / or the monke / that
preached these shameful blasphemys / 
or the deuill himselfe / who is father
of lies / could lye / speakyng in the horse
or in any of them: then doe all these
foresaid miracles proue nothinge his
purpose, But O mercyfull God / in
what a miserable state were we thine
afflicted mēbers / if it wer true / which
they say / being both enemyes to thee
and to vs also for thy truethes sake?
For we shold not onli suffer extreme
miseries / as losse of our goods / good
names / & the cōpany of our dere frēds
in our natiue country: but also burne
as heretikes in this world / if we came
in their cruell handlyng / & also burne

eternally in the vnquencheable fire of
hell / if their cruell curses myght take
effect. Wherefore we yelde thee most
harty thākes / O father of al mercies / 
and to thy sonne Iesus Chryst our sauiour:
whiche haste promysed for hys
sake and in his name thy kyngdome of
heauen to al them / which suffer persecucion
for thy righteousnesse sake.
How shal we then knowe true visiōs
of Angels from false / true apparitiōs
and miracles from counterfayte / but
by the scripture of god? which is the
rule / and true measure / where wyth
we must try all thynges as S. Iohn
sayeth: beeleue not euerye spirite / but
proue them / whether they be of God.
For manye false Prophetes are gone
out into the world. Herby is the spirite
of god knowen / sayeth he: euerye
spirite / whiche confesseth that Iesus
Chryst is come in the fleshe / is of god
&c. Whoso euer therfore sayeth / that
there is anye thyng / that pacifieth the
wrath of god or obtaineth his fauour
and forgeuenes of synnes / but onelye

Christes death and passiō: he denieth
Christ to be cōe a sauiour in the flesh.

helpe him in that office of saluacyon
and deliuering those soules frō sinne
and the paynes due for the same: and
so they cannot be of God but of Antichrist.
Thus I haue plainly / fully and
truly without fraud of cloking or coloure
of rhetorike and darke speache / 
to blind the eies of the sīple people / answered
to al (that I remember) which
the Papistes doe or can alledge / either
by writing / preaching or reasoning / for
the defence of their vnwrittē verites / 

wherevpon they builde so many detestable
idolatries and heresies: and the
same answers / if they be aptly applied
and placed by a discret and witty reader / 
wil suff

                  ce for the answere to all
that euer they haue or can bryng furth
for the maintaining of their vnwrytten
and vncertayne verites.
               And yet I wyll not be so much wedded
to myne owne witte or will / but
that if they be able to answer so plainly
and trulye to the Scriptures / authors
and reasons rehersed by me / as
I haue done to theirs / and to proue
their doctrine of vnwrytten very

                  : I shal not onely acknowledge mine
ignoraunce and erroure / but I shall
gladlye returne into Englande / recāt
myne heresyes / openlye submyttynge
myselfe to such discipline & correctiō / 
as they shall thynke mete fo: myne

For for euery heretike (as you cal
them) which you shal burn / wil arise
many faythful and cōstāt Christiās.
For except the grayn or corne of wheat
dye / it remaineth alone: but if it dye / 
it bringeth forth much fruite. Wherefore
I most hartely beseche the father
of heauē of his infinite mercye (if you
be not indurat in your heartes wyth
that synne / which is irremissible and
shal neuer be forgeuen in this worlde
nor in the worlde to come / and resyste

god of you knowen / and defendynge &
maintaining wicked doctrines / which
your consciences beare recorde to be
idolatries and heresies) that he wyll
mollifie your stony heartes / and geue
you fleshy heartes: yea rather spirituall
and godly hartes to worshyp him
truly in spirite / accordyng to his godly

wil / expressed in his holy word written.
And I exhort al you / which feare
god & be desierous to saue your owne
soules / to flee from this whore of Babilon
and from al her detestable idolatries
and heresies / not builded vpon
the sure rocke of gods infallible word
written but vpon the qualin

thou fast and stay thy fayth / whervpō
thou shalt builde al thy workes / vpon
the strong rocke of gods word / writtē
and conteined within the old testamēt
and the newe: which is able sufficiētly
to instruct thee in al thinges nedeful
to thy saluacion / and to the attaīmēt
of the kyngdome of heauen. To the
whiche I beseche the almightie father
of heauen of his infinite mercy and
goodnesse / and by the merytes of
his only sonne / oure sauiour &
