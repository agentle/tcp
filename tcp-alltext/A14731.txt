Christ.
            
               EVery good name
is as precious ointment;
but vnto
the (oh CHRIST) hath
God giuen a name aboue
all names in heauen and

earth, annoynted thee
with oyle aboue all thy fellowes.
All thy garments
smell of Mirrhe, Aloes,
and Cassia; because of
the sent of thy perfumes,
thy name is a bundle of
Mirrhe, cluster of Camphire,
and as the smell
of Libanus: But wee the
sonnes of men, haue dull
senses stuffed with earthly
sauours. Oh therefore
that thou, whom my
soule loueth, wouldest shew

thy seruant, where that
fragrant Spikenard is to
bee found, which will cast
a sauour all ouer thine
house; and helpe him so
to powre some smell portion
thereof vpon thine
head, as might draw vs
in the sauour of thine
oyntment to runne after
thee, Had he all the treasures
and Iewels of the
world, would hee not bestowe
them vpon Altars
and Crucifixes to thy honour,

if thou likedst of
and such seruices? But
these vanities, hee knoweth
full well, thy Ielousie
abhorreth. This thou hast
shewed him, that hee that
prayseth thee, honoureth
thee. Accept therefore,
and prosper the Office
of him that desireth not
heereby to gaine a name
on earth, who wisheth all
his thoughts and workes
may either honour thee,
or dishonour himselfe;

feed thy flocke, or mothes;
who reckoneth himselfe
vnworthy to bee as one of
thy whelpes, is willing to
bee of no name or number,
so thou mayest bee
ALL IN ALL.
            
            Guide thou my Pen, and
it shall shew forth thy
praise.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
               Colloss. 3. 11.
Christ is All in All.
            
               A Magnificent title,
a most ample and
stately Style, too
transcendent and
comprehēsiue for
any creature, Man
or Angell, due and fit onely for
him, vpon whose head it is heere
set, by his elect vessell, chosen of
purpose to bee the Ensigne-bearer
of his Name among the Nations,

worthily honoured by Augustine
for the best childe of grace, and
faithfullest seruant of the Lord, because
in all his writings hee affects
nothing more; nothing else in a
manner, then to aduance his name,
as heere in the former part of the
verse, to crie downe and nullifie all
other excellencies whatsoeuer, that
hee might in the latter, magnifie,
or rather as you see omnifie his
Lord and Master Christ, giuing the
Collossians to vnderstand, that how
euer there bee many things with
men, of great and different esteeme,
the aduantage of a Iew
being much aboue a Gentile; the
dignitie of a Grecian, aboue a
Scythian, or Barbarian, many
the priuiledges of a freeman, aboue
a bond-slaue; yet all these
with God, are nothing set by, who
hath so set all his loue and good
pleasure on his Sonne, that besides,

or out of him, hee regards no person,
respecteth no circumstance,
but slights all as Ciphers of no value.
Onely looke what there is of
Christ in any man, either by imputation,
or infusion, so much is hee
in Gods Books, with whom Christ
is All in All.
            
            The extent of which praise, that
wee may the fullier comprehend,
we may not measure Pauls phrase
by our owne ordinarie language,
in which by common abuse of
speech, wee lend it to euery thing
wee meane to commend a little aboue
the fellowes: As Salomon,
speaking after the sense and fashion
of worldlings, Bread (sayes he)
nourisheth, Wine refresheth, but Money
is all in all.
               Eccles. 10. It is not true of
Christ onely, as a by-word, or prouerbiall
commendation, but in the
fullest racke, a Proposition can bee
strained vnto in our apprehension:

and that in a twofold relation of
God and Man.
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Looke what God
can require for his satisfaction, or
wee desire for our perfection, is so
compleatly to be found in Christ,
that it need not bee sought elsewhere.
            With God, its true that worthy
Patriarchs and Saints haue been
some bodies; Abraham his friend,
Israel a potent Prince with him,
Moses a faithfull Steward in his
house, Noah, Samuel, and Daniel,
preuailing fauourites, that could
doe something with him, but all
through, and for the sake of the
Messias, the Heire, the sonne of
his desires, and good pleasure, in
whom hee hath heaped vp the fulnesse
of grace and treasures of all
perfection.

            This All-sufficiencie of Christ
as it cannot bee easily conceiued,
nor possiblie at once expressed,
so hath not the Spirit of God,
thought fit in one or a few Texts,
after one or a fewe wayes, but

Christ, whom because the world
was not worthy so soone to see,
nor God willing at once to shew
so rich a Iewell: hee therefore inwrapped
obscurely in these shaddowes,
till in the fulnesse of time
hee saw fit to reueale him in open
Mirrour, directly by his Forerunner,
pointing at him, Behold the
Lambe of God, &c.

right belong to him, who alone is

            In a word, this whole Vniuerse,
this same great All, and all the
things of mark and vse in it, as they

Martyr, else it looseth its healing
vertue, and turnes into bane and

                this Soueraigntie will
not endure either paritie or prioritie;
no Iupiter will Christ be, but
a Iehouah; no Helper, but Authour
and finisher of our saluation. To
all Hee Saints and Shee Saints, Merit
and Freewill-mongers, shall hee
not in his Iealousie breake out and
say, What haue I to doe with you?
If you can doe all,Aesopus in vita. or ought at all
without mee, then let mee alone,
let mee either bee Sauiour alone,
Mediator alone, All in all, or none
at all.
            But to leaue these selfe-cousned,
and selfe-condemned Idolaters,

whose whole Church and Religion
holds more of her Ladie, then
of our Lord; leaues Christ the least
of all to doe in matter of Merit
and Saluation, well were it with
many of vs, who professe and hold
the precious faith of Christ aright
in iudgement and doctrine, if in
affection and practise hee were, I
say,Erasmus in Euangelio. not All in all, but some body,
and some thing. In our tongue,
termes, and countenance, hee may
be heard and seene, but in our liues
and deedes, where is hee to bee
found?Sine Christa Christiani Bern. As a Sauiour and Benefactor,
many will owne him, but
as a Lord and Law giuer, few doe
know him; the prime of their
loues, ioyes, seruices, their backe
and belly, their Mammon, or any
thing shall haue before him. Hee
that should bee both Alpha and Omega,
its well if hee bee the Omega
of their thoughts and cares. May

it not be iustified of too too many,
that an Hawke, or an Hound, a
Dye, or Card, a Flowre in the
Garden, a new Suite and fashion of
apparell, and such other nifles and
trifles are their All in All: with
most and such as are of the wiser
sort of this generation, that which
Salomon iustly calls Nothing, (for
so hee peremptorily termes that,
which miserable men of this world
place all their confidence in) call
their Pandora,
               August. de Ciuit. Dei. their Iupiter, worship
as the great Diana, Empresse,
and goddesse of the whole world,
take away that from them, and
take away All: the hauing of it
makes them, the loosing of it vndoes
them. Great I confesse is the
power, and ample the commaund
that Mammon hath in this world
for many purposes, and in many
cases. But in the houre of sicknesse
let Naball call and crie vnto it

and see if it can deliuer him in the
euill day, and in distresse of conscience.
Let Iudas see what comfort
his money will afford him; in
the day of Death and Iudgement,
what does a penny and a pound, an
emptie purse, and a full purse differ?
Does not too too late experience
teach them to cry out, All is
vanitie, and force them with the
Emperour Seuerus to say, I haue
been all things, and it auailes nothing;
if I had a thousand worlds,
I would giue them to bee found of
God in Christ. Worthily therefore
did Charles the Great,Sie vetus illud, Nummus regnat, nummus vincit, nummus imperat, mutauit Carolus magnus apud Rensureum. change
that old By-word of money into
his Christian Symbole, Christ
reignes, Christ ouercomes, Christ tryumphs,
Christ is All in All.
            
            
               All then let him bee in all our
desires and wishes: Who is that
wise Merchant, that hath heart
large enough to conceiue and beleeue

this? let him goe sell all his
nothing, that he may compasse this
Pearle, barter his Bugles for this
Diamond; verily all the Haberdash
stuffe the whole pack of the world
hath, is not worthy to bee valued
with this Iewell, worthy of him
thou canst not bee, vnlesse thou
counts all drosse and losse to gaine
him, that is gaine in life and death,
vnlesse thou canst as the Apostles,
forsake all to follow him; yea, as
diuers of the common sort of his
followers lay downe all at the Apostles
feete for him, who layd
downe himselfe for vs, emptying
himselfe of his glorie, to fill vs
with grace and glory: yea, vnlesse
thou canst make nothing of thy
selfe, and thine owne righteousnesse,
which is the hardest thing
in practice that may bee. Few or
none I thinke there bee in the
sound of the Gospell, but haue

some faint and languide wishes, oh
that Christ were mine. But would
they know the reason why they
attaine not the sweet fruition and
rauishing possession of him, I am
his, and hee is mine. The reason is
because he will not bee found, and
had of such as seeke but lasily, and
coldly for him, that enquire not
through the streetes, as vndone
without him; as had rather then
want him, want all the world besides,
and crying as the Spouse,
Where art thou whom my soule loueth,
whom haue I in heauen like vnto
thee? Men and brethren, what
shall I doe that I may enioy him? Giue
me Christ, or I die, draw mee that I
may run after thee.
            
            These are the affections that befit
them that are like to bee speeders.
The sluggard lusteth, and
wanteth. He that desires any thing
aboue him, equally with him, or

without him, shall neuer obtaine
him; he will bee wooed in the first
place with all thy soule, strength,
and might, with all that is within
thee, or not at all of thee.
            
               All let him bee in all thy loues,
and aboue all other beloueds;
when thou hast gotten him, thinke
not enough to make much of him,
but remember hee well deserues to
bee and must bee All in all. Take
him not by the hand, but embrace
him with both thine Armes of
loue, and hold him with all thy
might, loue him till thou be sicke
of loue for him: such as will suffice
any one ordinary obiect, wife,
friend, health, or wealth, will
not giue him content; nay, not a
compound of many, but a Catholicion
of all; as hee hath deserued,
so he deseruedly challengeth. All
thy weake Riuerets vnited, will
scarce make one current strong

enough for him. Hee that did all,
suffered all, tooke all thine infirmities,
finished all for thee, is it not
reason he should be all in all, without
any corriuall in all thy affections?
Such as entertaine Princes,
can neuer thinke they shew loue
enough vnto them, and shall any
thing bee enough for this Prince of
our peace and saluation? I cannot
but reuerence the memory of that
reuerend Diuine,M. VVelsh. who beeing in a
deepe muse, after some discourse
that had passed of Christ, and
teares trickling abundantly from
his eyes before hee was aware, being
vrged for the cause thereof,
confessed ingenuously it was because
hee could not draw his dull
heart to prise Christ aright: A rare
minde in Christians, who thinke
euery little enough, and too much
for him.
            ALL let him bee in all our references

and respects to others, yea
in all our elections and valuations
of wife, friends, companions, seruants,
onely to prize Christ, and
his Image, his Faith, and Graces,
not kindred, not wealth, not greatnesse,
not other parts, but onely
the whole of a man, which is his
Christianity; dare not to yoke thy
selfe vnequally with any vntamed
heyfer, that beares not his yoke:
Spouse not but in the Lord; call
none Father, Mother, or Brother,
but such as hee did, that is,
such as doe his Fathers will: set
not poore Lazarus at the footestoole
of thy heart, and Diues with
his Gold Ring, and his Purple, in
the throne of esteeme, lest Christ
bee offended for hauing his glorious
Gospell in respect of persons.
Oh what a difficult vertue is this
when it commeth to the practising,
to ouersee and neglect all glistering

lures, and stales of the flesh, and to
know no man for any such carnall
Caparisons, but to consider him as
a new creature in Christ, and delight
thy selfe in them as the most
excellent of the earth, the onely
true Gentile, Noble, Worthies of
the World. How royall and memorable
was that practise of Ingo,
an ancient King of the Draues and
Veneds, who making a stately feast,
not as Ahasuerosh, to shew the
bountie of his owne, but the glory
of Christes Kingdome, set all his
Nobles, which were at that time
Pagans, and vnconuerted to the
Christian faith, in his Hall below,
and certaine poore Christians
in his Presence Chamber with
himselfe, with kingly cheare and
attendance; at which they wondring,
hee told them this, hee did
not as King of the Draues, but
as King of another world, wherein

these were his consorts and fellow-Princes: these hee saw with a spirituall
eye, clad in white Robes,
and worthy his company, to them
he would giue Ciuill due in the regiment
of the Common-wealth,
but those he must loue and honour
in his heart as beloued, and honored
of God.Aeneas Syluius cap. 20. Europ

least respect to a Christian, or a
Minister in the name of Christ, to
account them worthy their company,
whom they ought to haue in
singular respect, and to accompt
their very feete beautifull, for their
Lord and Embassage sake, onely
with this Prouiso, that diuine and
nimious adoration be not giuen, a
fault on the other hand, common
in Poperie, to their spirituall Fathers

and Founders of orders and
rules whom they obey and reuerence
aboue Christ,Gualtan 1. Cor. as Gualter

this or that Faction, whereas with
God I dare boldly say, there is
neither Caluenist nor Lutherane,
Protestant nor Puritane, Conformitane,
or Non-Conformitane,
but faith and loue in Christ is All
in All.
            
            
               All let him be in all our ioyes,
in stead of all other contents vnto
vs; good reason is it, that he should
fill our hearts, that filleth All in all
things: If hee bee ours. Apollo is

and all is ours, we Christs, and Christ

other mysterie enabled Paul to
want and abound, but the fruition
of him, whose goodnes and greatnesse
is such, that all accessions
adde nothing, all defects detract
nothing to the happinesse of him
that enioyes him, who is All in All.
            
            
               
               Aboue all, All let him bee with vs
in the maine of All, that is in the
poynt of Iustification; there (bee
sure) we repose all our confidence
in him alone, bewaring least wee
share and part stakes with any act
of our owne, yea, with any grace
or worke of his in vs, lest hee bee
in vaine and of none effect vnto vs.
This glorie will hee by no meanes
endure, should bee diuided with
any coadiutor, concause, or copartner
what euer: nay, he takes it
ill and indignely at our hands, if
hauing him, we hold not our selues
compleatly righteous in Gods
sight, if for want of this or that
grace wee mourne ouermuch, hang
downe our head, and will not bee
comforted, as if his grace were
not sufficient for vs, as if he were
not better then tenne, yea, then
tenne thousand graces vnto vs, if
wee stand vpon this or that measure

of grace, twenty to one if we
had that wee desire, wee would be
full and rich, and stand in no need
of him, who is the giuer of all
grace, or that wee would be prouder
of the gift, then of the Author
of euery good gift, and not rest in
him that is our wisdome, our righteousnesse,
and redemption.
            
               All let him be in all the graces of
Sanctification, who onely indeed
is the very life and soule of them
all. What is knowledge but Heathenish
science, if hee bee not the
obiect, whom to know is eternall
life? What is faith, and trust, and
hope in God? if not in & through
Christ, but a Iewish wild vngrounded
confidence? Patience, but a
Stoicall blockishnesse? Temperance,
and all the whole beauty of
vertues, but either naturall qualities,
or morall habits vnacceptable
to God, vnprofitable to our

selues, soure Grapes, glistring vices,
if Christ bee not the forme of
them, without whom there is no
qualitie that God relisheth in vs,
whereof Christ is not the roote:
wherefore as Apothecaries sweeten
all their Confections with Sugar,
and perfume their Cordials
with Muske; so let vs grace all
our graces in Christ, without
whom, fooles wee are to pride
our selues in any thing that Nature.

that influence wee receiue, and
of those rayes that come from
this Sun of Righteousnesse. Fooles
are wee, when wanting grace, power,
or strength to ouercome ill,
or doe well; to seeke supply any
where else, saue of him, of whose
fulnes all the Saints that euer were
receiued grace for grace. Who
would goe to the Packe, when hee

may goe to the Warehouse, who
would fetch water at the Cestern,
when he may haue it at the Spring

               All let him be in all our deeds,
whether we eat or drinke, whether
wee pray, read, or meditate, giue
Almes, or worke in our callings,
let all bee done in the name of our
Lord Iesus, begun with his leaue,
performed with his aide, and concluded
to his glory, without whom
wee can doe nothing,Macarius. no more
then the bird can flye without
wings, the Ship saile without wind
or tyde, the body mooue without
the soule: what euer good workes
we doe with an eye from his, and a
skew vnto our owne names; the
more paine wee take, the more
penaltie of pride belongs vnto vs,
the more cost, the more losse; wee
and our moneys shall perish together,
whereas the least Cup of

cold water giuen for his take, who
knowes our workes, and the intent
of our workes, shall not loose the
reward: Verely, who would be
so foolish as to doe any worke to
any other pay-master, or who so
vngratfull, that would not doe any
worke that he should require that
hath so well deserued to command
more then all wee are, or can doe.
Is he All in All with vs, If we dare
deny him any thing. I commend
not the discretion, but admire the
fidelitie and zeale of that renowned
Foxe, who neuer would deny
Beggar that asked in his Name:
Then are works good works, When
the loue of Christ constraines vs to
them, and when Christs eye is
more then all the world besides;
especially, If when all is done, all
the thankes and praise of the Deed
redound to him. That pollicie is
remarkable in the Apostles cure of

the Creeple, and in Saint Paul, in
that he would neuer suffer any part
of the repute or honor of any his
acts or labours, rest vpon his owne
head, but repells it forcibly from
himselfe, and reflects it carefully
vpon his Lord Christ: Not I, not
I, but the grace of Christ in mee, I
liue not but Christ in me. In which
Not, sayes Bradwardine, there lies
a great deale of subtiltie, like that
of Ioab, that when hee had fought
the Field, and gotten the vpper
hand, sent for Dauid to carry away
the credit of the Victory. Oh how
difficult is this for vs, not to lurch
some part of the praise, and suffer
peeces of the Sacrifice to cleaue to
our owne nets and yarne. Whereas
in truth, our deepest wisdome
and strongest policie lay in this,
not to glorie in our wisdome or
strength, but to glory in the Lord,
who worketh All in All things.
            
               
               All, let him bee in all our
thoughts and speeches, how happy
were it if he were neuer out of
our sight and minds, but that our
soules were directed towards him,
and fixed on him, as the Sunne-flowre
towards the Sunne, the Iron
to the Load-stone, the Load-stone
to the Pole-starre. Hath he not for
that purpose resembled himselfe to
all familiar and obuious obiects;Musculus & Brentius in Iohannens.

open our eyes wee might behold
him; to Bread, Water and Wine,
that in all our repasts wee might
feed on him; to the Doore, that
in all our out and ingoing,Bernard. wee
might haue him in remembrance;

to CHRIST.
            THou oh Lord Christ alone,
that knowest how
little account I make of this
little honour and seruice I
haue done vnto thee. How
farre it is from mee to think
I haue sayd or written any
thing worthy of thee, and
yet doe nothing doubt but
thou likest and acceptest well
of what I haue done, because
I know it came of thee, that
I should haue the least will
or skill to doe it. Now therfore
what is it I haue to petition

vnto thee for, but that
as thou alone art worthy of
that poore all that I am and
can; so thou wouldest please
to take possession, not of any
corner, or limme, but of the
whole temple of my soule,
and tabernacle of my body.
Thou who scourgest out of
thy Fathers House buyers and
sellers, who turnedst out the
mourners out of Iairus his
doores, chase out of my heart
all carnal desires and delights,
troublesome passions, roote
out all thorny cares, cause
euery proud thought, and
high imagination to fall as
Dagon before thee, that thou

maiest inuest thy selfe in thine
own Throne, rule and raigne
as sole Commaunder of my
will and affections, dwell in
thine owne Shrine, adorne it
here with thy grace, till thou
replenish it with thy glory,
euen till thou thy selfe resignest
vp thy Scepter to thy
Father and God, become All
in All.

               Cum multa sint quibus per vitam

ex omnibus semper & ad omnia
desideremus, sed nunc illud, nunc istud
adhibeamus, alias alio ad praesentem in
seruiente necessitatem; vestem quippe
induimus quae alimoniam non praebet,
sed cibum appetentibus aliud quaerendum
est▪ contingere seu tractare cupientibus
manus sufficit, sed cum dufcultare
oportet nihil commodat. At
Saluator in ipsoviuentibus sic semper
& omnimodis adest, vt quibuscunque
eorum necessitatibus consulat, & ipsis
sit omnia, nec alio se vertere, nec aliunde
quaerere quidquam sinat, non enim
egent aliquo Sancti quod ipse non sit:
generat nimirum ipsos, educat, alit &
lumen ipsis est & oculus idem, altor
simul & alimenium, panis, aqua, vnguentum,
vestimentū, via, et vie terminus,
membra nos-sumus, ipse capur,
certandum est? Ipse certat vna; praeclare
certamus? praeses & arbiter certaminis;

vincimus? ipse mox corona
est, sic vndecunque mentem nostram
ad seipsum aduertit, suaui tyrannide
ad se solum trahens, sibi soli copulans
& astringens, nec ad aliud effundi, nec
vllius rei amore implicari patitur:
ipse domum cordis implet, qui coelum
& terrā implet, et omnia in omnibus.
