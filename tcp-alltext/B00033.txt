               LEt not the dull and ſluggiſh ſleepe
               cloſe vp thy waking eye,
               Vntill aright with iudgement deep,
               thy dayly deedes thou trye.
            
            
               He which one ſinne in conſcience keepes,
               when he to quyet goes,
               More ventrous is, then he that ſleepes
               with twenty mortall foes.
            
            
               Therefore at night call vnto minde,
               how thou the day haſt ſpent:
               Prayſe God, if nought amiſſe thou find;
               if ought, betime repent.
            
            
               And ſinc
                     •
                   
                  
                     •
                  hy bed a patterne is
               of death and fatall herſe,
               Toward bed it ſhall not be amiſſe,
               Thus to record in verſe:
            
            
               My bed is like the graue ſo cold;
               and ſleepe, which ſhuts mine eye,
               Reſembles death: clothes, which me fold,
               declare the mould ſo drye.
            
            
               The byting Fleas reſemble well
               the wrinckling wormes to be,
               Which with me in the graue ſhall dwel,
               where I no light ſhall ſee.
            
            
               The nightly bel, which I heare towle,
               as I am layd in bed,
               Declares, the bell ſhall for me knowle
               and ring, when I am dead.
            
            
               The riſing in the morne likewiſe,
               when ſleepie night is paſt,
               Puts mee in mind, how I ſhall riſe
               to Iudgement at the laſt.
            
            
               I goe to bed as to my graue:
               God knowes when I ſhall wake:
               But (Lord) I truſt, thou wilt me ſaue,
               and me to mercy take.
            
            FINIS.
