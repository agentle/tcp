               How now sirra, wheres thy maister?

               God in heauen knowes.
            
            
               2.
               Why, dost not thou know?
            
            
               
               Wag.
               Yes I know, but that followes not.
            
            
               1.
               Go too sirra, leaue your ieasting, and tell vs where
hée is.
            
            
               Wag.
               That follows not necessary by force of argument,
that you being licentiate should stand vpon't, therefore acknowledge
your error, and be attentiue.
            
            
               2.
               Why, didst thou not say thou knewst?

               Yes sirra, I heard you.
            
            
               Wag.
               Aske my fellow if I be a thiefe.
            
            
               2.
               Well, you will not tell vs.
            
            
               Wag.
               Yes sir, I will tell you, yet if you were not dunces
you would neuer aske me such a question, for is not he corpus
naturale, and is not that mobile, then wherefore should
you aske me such a question: but that I am by nature flegmaticke,
slowe to wrath, and prone to leachery, (to loue I
would say) it were not for you to come within fortie foote of
the place of execution, although I do not doubt to sée you
both hang'd the next Sessions. Thus hauing triumpht ouer
you, I will set my countnance like a precisian, and begin to
speake thus: truly my deare brethren, my maister is within
at dinner with Valdes and Cornelius, as this wine if it could
speake, it would enforme your worships, and so the Lord
blesse you, preserue you, and kéepe you my deare brethren,
my deare brethren.

               Were he a stranger, and not alied to me, yet should
I grieue for him: but come let vs go and informe the Rector,
and sée if hée by his graue counsaile can reclaime him.

               O but I feare me nothing can reclaime him.

               That was the cause, but yet per accident,

               Abiure the scriptures, and his Sauiour Christ,
               Wée flye, in hope to get his glorious soule,
               Nor will we come, vnlesse he vse such meanes
               Whereby he is in danger to be damnd:
               Therefore the shortest cut for coniuring
               Is stoutly to abiure the Trinitie,
               And pray deuoutly to the prince of hell.

               What might the staying of my bloud portend?
               Is it vnwilling I should write this bill?
               Why streames it not, that I may write afresh?
               Faustus giues to thee his soule: ah there it stayde,
               Why shouldst thou not? is not thy soule thine owne?
               Then write againe, Faustus giues to thée his soule.
            
            Enter Mephastophilis with a chafer of coles.

               Heres fier, come Faustus, set it on.
            
            
               Fau.
               So now the bloud begins to cleare againe,
               Now will I make an ende immediately.
            
            
               Me.
               O what will not I do to obtaine his soule?

                  Consummatum est, this Bill is ended,
               And Faustus hath bequeath'd his soule to Lucifer.
               
               But what is this inscription on mine arme?

               If vnto God hée'le throwe thée downe to hell,

               Me.
               Ile fetch him somewhat to delight his minde.
               exit.
            
            Enter with diuels, giuing crownes and rich apparell to

               Fau.
               Speake Mephastophilis, what meanes this shewe?
            
            
               Me.
               Nothing Faustus, but to delight thy minde withall,
               And to shewe thee what Magicke can performe.

               Speake Faustus, do you deliuer this as your déede?
            
            
               Fau.

               Now Faustus aske what thou wilt.
            
            
               Fau.
               First will I question with thée about hell,
               Tel me, where is the place that men call hell?
            
            
               Me.
               Under the heauens.
            
            
               Fau.
               I, but where about?
            
            
               Me.
               Within the bowels of these elements,
               Where we are tortur'd and remaine for euer,
               Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd
               In one selfe place, for where we are is hell,
               And where hell is, must we euer be:
               And to conclude, when all the world dissolues,
               And euery creature shalbe purified,
               All places shall be hell that is not heauen.
            
            
               
               Fau.
               Come, I thinke hell's a fable.
            
            
               Me.
               I, thinke so still, till experience change thy minde.
            
            
               Fau.
               Why? thinkst thou then that Faustus shall bée
damn'd?
            
            
               Me.
               I of necessitie, for here's the scrowle,
               Wherein thou hast giuen thy soule to Lucifer.
               
            
            
               Fau.
               I, and body too, but what of that?
               Thinkst thou that Faustus is so sond,
               To imagine, that after this life there is any paine?
               Tush these are trifles and méere olde wiues tales.
            
            
               Me.
               But Faustus I am an instance to proue the contrary
For I am damnd, and am now in hell.
            
            
               Fau.
               How? now in hell? nay and this be hell, Ile willingly
be damnd here: what walking, disputing, &c. But
leauing off this, let me haue a wife, the fairest maid in Germany,
for I am wanton and lasciuious, and can not liue
without a wife.
            
            
               Me.
               How, a wife? I prithée Faustus talke not of a wife.
            
            
               Fau.
               Nay sweete Mephastophilis fetch me one, for I will
haue one.
            
            
               Me.
               UUell thou wilt haue one, sit there till I come, Ile
fetch thée a wife in the diuels name.
            
            Enter with a diuell drest like a woman,
with fier workes.
            
               Me:
               Tel Faustus, how dost thou like thy wife?
            
            
               Fau:
               A plague on her for a hote whore.
            
            
               Me:
               Tut Faustus, marriage is but a ceremoniall toy, if
thou louest me, thinke more of it.
               Ile cull thée out the fairest curtezans,
               And bring them eu'ry morning to thy bed,
               She whome thine eie shall like, thy heart shal haue,
               Be she as chaste as was Penelope,
               
               As wise as Saba, or as beautiful
               As was bright Lucifer before his fall.

The framing of this circle on the ground,

               Maister doctor Faustus, I haue heard strange report
of thy knowledge in the blacke Arte, how that none in
my Empire, nor in the whole world can compare with thée,
for the rare effects of Magicke: they say thou hast a familiar
spirit, by whome thou canst accomplish what thou list, this
therefore is my request that thou let me sée some proofe of th

thou shalt be no wayes preiudiced or indamaged.

               My gratious Soueraigne, though I must confesse
my selfe farre inferior to the report men haue published, and
nothing answerable to the honor of your Imperial maiesty,

               Then doctor Faustus, marke what I shall say, As
I was sometime solitary set, within my Closet, sundry
thoughts arose, about the honour of mine auncestors, howe
they had wonne by prowesse such exploits, gote such riches,
subdued so many kingdomes, as we that do succéede, or they
that shal hereafter possesse our throne, shal (I feare me) neuer
attaine to that degrée of high renowne and great authoritie,
amongest which kings is Alexander the great, chiefe
spectacle of the worldes preheminence,
               The bright shining of whose glorious actes
               Lightens the world with his reflecting beames,
               As when I heare but motion made of him,
               It grieues my soule I neuer saw the man:
               If therefore thou, by cunning of thine Art,
               Canst raise this man from hollow vaults below,
               where lies intombde this famous Conquerour,
               And bring with him his beauteous Paramour,
               Both in their right shapes, gesture, and attire

               I thinke my maister meanes to die shortly,
               For he hath giuen to me al his goodes,
               And yet me thinkes, if that death were néere,
               He would not banquet, and carowse, and swill
               Amongst the Students, as euen now he doth,
               who are at supper with such belly-cheere,
               As Wagner nere beheld in all his life.

               1. Sch.
               Maister Doctor Faustus, since our conference about
faire Ladies, which was the beutifulst in all the world,
we haue determined with our selues, that Helen of Greece
was the admirablest Lady that euer liued: therefore master
Doctor, if you wil do vs that fauor, as to let vs sée that péerelesse
Dame of Greece, whome al the world admires for maiesty,
wée should thinke our selues much beholding vnto
you.
            
            
               Fau.
               Gentlemen, for that I know your friendship is vnfained,
and Faustus custome is not to deuie the iust requests
of those that wish him well, you shall behold that pearelesse
dame of Greece, no otherwaies for pompe and maiestie, then
when sir Paris crost the scas with her, and brought the spoiles
to rich Dardama. Be silent then, for danger is in words.
            
            
               
Musicke sounds, and Helen passeth ouer the Stage.
            
               2. Sch.
               Too simple is my wit to tell her praise,
               Whom all the world admires fo

               No maruel tho the angry Greekes pursude
               With tenne yeares warre the rape of such a quéene,
               Whose heauenly beauty passeth all compare.
            
            1. Since we haue séene the pride of natures workes,
            And onely Paragon of excellence,
            Enter an old man.
            Let vs depart, and for this glorious déed
            Happy and blest be Faustus euermore.
            
               Fau.
               Gentlemen farwel, the same I wish to you.
            
            Exeunt Schollers.
            
               Old.
               Ah Doctor Faustus, that I might preuaile,
               To guide thy steps vnto the way of life,
               By which swéete path thou maist attaine the gole
               That shall conduct thée to celestial rest.
               Breake heart, drop bloud, and mingle it with teares,
               Teares falling from repentant heauinesse
               Of thy most vilde and loathsome filthinesse,
               The stench whereof corrupts the inward soule
               With such flagitious crimes of hainous sinnes,
               As no commiseration may expel,
               But mercie Faustus of thy Sauiour swéete,
               Whose bloud alone must wash away thy guilt.
            
            
               Fau.
               Where art thou Faustus? wretch what hast thou done?
               Damnd art thou Faustus, damnd, dispaire and die,
               Hell calls for right, and with a roaring voyce
               Sayes, Faustus come, thine houre is come,
               Mepha. giues him a dagger.
               And Faustus will come to do thée right.
            
            
               Old.
               Ah stay good Faustus, stay thy desperate steps,
               I sée an Angell houers ore thy head,
               And with a violl full of precious grace,
               Offers to powre the same into thy soule,
               Then call for mercie and auoyd dispaire.
            
            
               Fau.
               Ah my swéete friend, I féele thy words
               
                  
To comfort my distressed soule,
               Leaue me a while to ponder on my sinnes.
            
            
               Old.
               I goe swéete Faustus, but with heauy cheare,
fearing the ruine of thy hopelesse soule.
            
            
               Fau.
               Accursed Faustus, where is mercie now?
               I do repent, and yet I do dispaire:
               Hell striues with grace for conquest in my breast,
               What shal I do to shun the snares of death?
            
            
               Me.
               Thou traitor Faustus, I arrest thy soule
               For disobedience to my soueraigne Lord,
               Reuolt, or Ile in peece-meale teare thy flesh.
            
            
               Fau:
               Sweete Mephastophilis, intreate thy Lord
               To pardon my vniust presumption,
               And with my blood againe I wil confirme
               My former vow I made to Lucifer.
               
            
            
               Me.
               Do it then quickely, with vnfained heart,
               Lest greater danger do attend thy drift.
            
            
               Fau:
               Torment sweete friend, that base and crooked age,
               That durst disswade me from thy Lucifer,
               
               With greatest torments that our hel affoords.
            
            
               Me:
               His faith is great, I cannot touch his soule,
               But what I may afflict his body with,
               I wil attempt, which is but little worth.
            
            
               Fau:
               One thing, good seruant, let me craue of thée
               To glut the longing of my hearts desire,
               That I might haue vnto my paramour,
               That heauenly Helen which I saw of late,
               Whose swéete imbracings may extinguish cleane
               These thought s that do disswade me from my vow,
               And kéepe mine oath I made to Lucifer.
               
            
            
               Me.
               
                  Faustus, this, or what else thou shalt desire,
               Shalbe performde in twinckling of an eie.
            
            enter Helen.
            
               Fau:
               Was this the face that lancht a thousand shippes?
               And burnt the toplesse Towres of Ilium?

Come Helen, come giue mée my soule againe.

               Oft haue I thought to haue done so, but the diuell
threatned to teare mée in péeces, if I namde God, to fetch
both body and soule, if I once gaue eare to diuinitie: and
now tis too late: Gentlemen away, lest you perish with me.

               Ah Faustus,
               Now hast thou but one bare hower to liue,
               And then thou must be damnd perpetually:
               Stand stil you euer moouing spheres of heauen,
               That 
                     •
                  ime may cease, and midnight neuer come:
               Faire Natures eie, rise rise, againe, and make
               Perpetuall day, or let this houre be but a yeere,
               A moneth, a wéeke, a naturall day,
               That Faustus may repent and saue his soule,
               O lente lente curite noctis equi:
               The starres mooue stil, time runs, the clocke wil strike,
               The diuel wil come, and Faustus must be damnd.
               O Ile leape vp to my God: who pulles me downe?
               See see where Christs blood streames in the firmament,
               One drop would saue my soule, halfe a drop, ah my Christ,
               Ah rend not my heart for naming of my Christ,
               Yet wil I call on him, oh spare me Lucifer!
               
               
                  
Where is it now? tis gone:
               And see where God stretcheth out his arme,
               And bends his irefull browes:
               Mountaines and hilles, come come, and fall on me,
               And hide me from the heauy wrath of God.
               No no, then wil I headlong runne into the earth:
               Earth gape, O no, it wil not harbour me:
               You starres that raignd at my natiuitie,
               whose influence hath alotted death and hel,
               Now draw vp Faustus like a foggy mist,
               Into the intrailes of yon labring cloude,
               That when you vomite foorth into the ayre,
               My limbes may issue from your smoaky mouthes,
               So that my soule may but ascend to heauen:
               Ah, halfe the houre is past:
               The watch strikes.
               Twil all be past anone:
               Oh God, if thou wilt not haue mercy on my soule,
               Yet for Christs sake, whose bloud hath ransomd me,
               Impose some end to my incessant paine,
               Let Faustus liue in hel a thousand yeeres,
               A hundred thousand, and at last be sau

               O no end is limited to damned soules,
               Why wert thou not a creature wanting soule?
               Or, why is this immortall that thou hast?
               Ah Pythagoras metem su cossis
                   were that true,
               This soule should flie from me, and I be changde
               Unto some brutish beast: al beasts are happy, for when they die,
               Their soules are soone dissolud in elements,
               But mine must liue still to be plagde in hel:
               Curst be the parents that ingendred me:
               No Faustus, curse thy selfe, curse Lucifer,
               
               That hath depriude thée of the ioyes of heauen:
               The clooke striketh twelue.
               O it strikes, it strikes, now body turne to ayre,
               Or Lucifer wil beare thée quicke to hel:
               Thunder and lightning.
               
                  
Oh soule, be changde into little water drops,
               And fal into the Ocean, nere be found:
               My God, my God, looke not so fierce on me:
               Enter diuels.
               Adders, and Serpents, let me breathe a while:
               Ugly hell gape not, come not Lucifer,
               
               Ile burne my bookes, ah Mephastophilis.

               Whose fiendful fortune may exhort the wise,

               whose deepenesse doth intise such forward wits,
