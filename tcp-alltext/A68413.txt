(the which is alſo obſerued throughout
all Aſia) that none will enterpriſe to viſit
the king, noble man, or perticularly any

with all worthy of thanks, the which is not onely done in
token of great humilitie & obedience, but alſo of a zealous
loue & friendly affection to their ſuperiours & wel

but alſo of euery harbor apperteining to euery place
whervnto they came, & of the great reſiſtance they found

            ¶TO
THE MOST HIGH
and mightie Prince our King
and fouereigne, Don Iohn, the
third of that name, king
of Portingale, and of
the Algarues,
&c.
            
               IT hath ſéemed to me ſo ſtraunge and
waightie a thing (moſt high & mightie
Prince our king and Souereigne)
to vndertake to write of the moſt
worthy and valyaunt acts which the
Portingales haue enterpriſed in the
diſcouery and conqueſt of the Indias,
that oftentimes I thought to giue
ouer and relinquiſh the ſame, but as the attempt and dooing
thereof was principally taken in hande for the glorye of
Almightye God, and to conuert thoſe barbarous Nations
to the Chriſtian Faith, and the great honour of your highneſſe,
wherein God gaue them (by his Omnipotent power,
fauour and mercye (ſuch fortunate ſucceſſe in the atchieuing
of thoſe famous actes, without whoſe great prouidence
it coulde neuer haue béene performed or brought
to paſſe. And therefore doe hope and altogether comfort
my ſelfe with the ayde and aſſiſtaunce of his diuine goodneſſe
in publiſhing the ſame by writing, yéelding the
glorie thereof onely to his celeſtiall Godhead, and the

praiſe tereſtriall vnto your excellent highneſſe, and to
that famous and moſt happie king, Don Manuel your Father.
And although the ſame be well knowne and ſpread abroad
ouer all the worlde, yet it cannot be ſo perfectlye
publiſhed vnleſſe it bée ſet forth in writing. For by this
meanes the memorie thereof will indure for euer, becauſe
that the writings will alwayes ſhew the ſame to bée preſent.
Like as it doth continue thoſe actes of the Gréeks, and
of the Romanes, the which long ſince is paſt ſo many
yeares. And therefore they lyke wiſe men, perceiuing the
ſame to be true, did trauaile all that was poſſible to leaue
the memorie thereof by writing, and noting that the worthineſſe
of the ſame did conſiſt much in the eloquence of
the writer, did therefore chooſe ſuch excellent learned men
as thoſe were that wrote the ſame, béeing thereto aided
with much fauour and helpe, of others that were nothing
inferior vnto theyr own, & poſſible were far greater, but for
that the ſame did not remaine in writing, there is no memorie
thereof, euen as thoſe of the Aſſyrians, of the Medes,
of the Perſians, of the Affricans againſt the Romanes,
of the Sweuians againſt Iulius Caeſar, of the Spaniards againſt
the Moores in the recouerye of their Countrey of
Spayne. Principallye of thoſe inuincible and holye
Kinges of Portingale your aunceſtours, the King Don
Alonſo Henriques, the King Don Sancho his ſonne, the
King Don Alonſo, the which did gettte the Kingdome
of Portingale, and of the Algarues, in the which conqueſt
there was wonderfull greate actes done, and that
by force of Armes. Of all the which almoſt there hath
remayned no memorie of that there ſhoulde haue béene,
yea, thoſe matters of the Indyas, the which was done
but yeſterdaye, there is no man that hath the ſame in
memorye more then foure perſonnes, ſo that if they had
dyed, all the ſame hadde ended with them, the which
woulde haue béene imputed to theyr greate ſhame and
rebuke.
            
               
And I hauing a regarde, and partlye a remorſe to ſée this
loſſe, did therefore determine my ſelfe to note of thoſe notable
actes, the which your ſubiects hath done in the diſcouerie
and Conqueſt of the Indias, of whoſe valiauntneſſe
there is none of theyr progenitours of any age or antiquitie
that euer did excéede them, no, nor yet were equall
with them. For leauing a ſide the Conqueſt of the Semyrian
of Cyro, Pirhus, and of other barbarous, all (the
which was nothing in compariſon of this) and take amongeſt
them alſo that great Alexander the which was ſo feared
and wondred at throughout all the world, ſince that the
Indias is frequented by the Portingales: theyr dooings are
no more meruailed at, then a dead Lyon in reſpect of one
aliue, for the Conqueſt of Alexander was all by lande,
and againſt people that were ſmallie accuſtomed or trayned
in the feates of warres, hée alwayes going in his roiall
perſon, but this of the Indias was done by ſea, and that
by your Captaines, béeing vpon the ſame a whole yeare,
and eight monethes, and at the leaſt ſixe monethes, not along
or néere any coaſt, but by the bottomeleſſe and great
Ocean Sea, and departing from the lymites of the Occident,
and bearing ſayle alwayes towarde the Cape De
las Playas, or ſuch lyke, without diſcouering or ſéeing any
other thing, but onelye the heauens and water, going
round about all the Spheare, a matter neuer before attempted
by anye mortall man, nor yet almoſt imagined
by anye, to put the ſame in practiſe, and they hauing paſt
greate hunger, thirſt and other infirmityes, beſides that
euerye day with thoſe furious ſtormes and raines, in daunger
a thouſand times of their liues. And as I ſay, they hauing
paſt thoſe feares and daungerous troubles by ſea, yet
after theyr arriual into the Indias, found thēſelues in great
and cruell battells, (not with men that did ſight onely with
their Bowes, Arrowes, and Speares,) as they didde in
Alexanders time, but with ſuch as were ſtout & of a hauty
ſtomacke, and with men that were experienced in the wars,

of the which kinde of people there is not onely in the Indias,
but as farre as we can vnderſtand, there is of the like
in Aſia, and beſides theyr accuſtomed weapons (the which
are many and good) yet they haue Ordinaunce, Caléeuers,
and many fire-workes more plentie then the Portingales
had, ſo that the power of theſe men was alwaies
ſo greate, that the force of king Poro with whome Alexander
did fight, was not comparable, yet notwithſtanding
the Portingales did giue them continually the ouerthrow,
although theyr ſtrength was but ſmall, yet they neuer left
the warres, as Alexander did. And leauing off to declare
of the Gréekes and of theyr actes, and now to come
to the Romanes, who with theyr huge armye, and with
theyr greate Fléete, the which ſéemed to couer the whole
Sea, thought to conqueſt the whole worlde, yet they neuer
durſt aduenture by Sea further then the redde Sea,
neyther yet the greateſt of their famous victoryes, did or
was euer lyke vnto the leaſt of thoſe battayles that was
done by our men in the Indyas, in the which it is ſo well
knowne, moſt inuincible Prince, the greate proſperitye of
the King your Father and you, ſo that without moouing
of your ſelfe out of your pallaice, was diſcouered and
conquered by your Captaines, the which neuer Princes
could by themſelues conquere or diſcouer, ſo that there
was neuer Conqueſt of the Barbarous, nor of the Grecians,
nor of the Latyniſts, the which was of lyke difficultie
as this hath béene, neyther yet Kinges nor Captaines,
of none of all theſe Nations, was ſo equall in force nor
yet in valyauntneſſe as thoſe of your Father, and of yours,
the which is manifeſtly declared by the diſcourſe of the hiſtorie
following.
            And touching theyr greate actes which they dydde
worthelye fulfill and bring to paſſe, wée muſt verelye beléeue
that it was Gods good will and pleaſure, that
thoſe Barbarous, béeing diſcouered with theyr vaine
Idolls, and with the falſe ſect of Mahomet, ſhoulde ioyne

themſelues with the Catholike faith, and to be as it wer in
one Corall, and vnder one Paſtour or Shepheard, as at
this preſent the great multitude that héereby are increaſed
to the Chriſtian Religion, is a manifeſt teſtimonie
and witneſſe thereof. After which great exploytes,
your Highnes gaue commandement that the Chriſtian doctrine
of the Brotherhood of the company of Ieſus ſhould be
there inſtructed & taught them, of the which your Highneſſe
hath had ſo ſpeciall a care like a moſt godlye and Chriſtian
Prince, that not onely you were the firſt that commaunded
the ſame to be brought from Rome, for that they might bée
the better inſtructed in all their Kingdomes, but alſo doeth
maintaine vpon your owne charges in this holy companye
the multitudes that doeth daylye ſubmit themſelues to the
ſame. As we doe ſée in the ſumptuous Colledge of Coimbro,
where to ennoble and augment the honor of your kingdomes,
you haue erected and founded an Vniuerſitie: where,
with the charges that is daylye done there, and with your
countenaunce together, it is hoped, that the ſame may be accounted
amongſt the floriſhing Vniuerſities of all Europe:
whereas there is maintained alſo vpon your charges manye
Colledges of the order of poore begging Friers, and others
of like profeſſion, for like as the reformation that was there
made was profitable to them all: ſo he commaunded, that
there ſhould be many Diuines for to declare the Euangelycall
law, which your Highnes is not onely at this charges
with religious men, but alſo with temporall men, for as
there is many of your ſubiects that doth defend ye ſtate Republike
or Common welth, and doth inlarge the ſame with
their armour, ſo ther are others that doth beautifie the ſame
with learning. Theſe heroycall vertues of your Highneſſe
being ſo well knowen vnto me, forſomuch as this Booke,
beſides others that I haue made, hath ſome taſt or kindred
of learning, doth incourage me the more to ſet them foorth,
for that as I ſay, there may remaine a perpetuall memorye
of ſo notable actes as ſo many Gentlemen and Knights of

the Portingales your ſubiects hath done, the which hath benefited
me very much, my being in the Indias, where I trauayled
with my Father, who by your Highnes commaundement
was ſent thether to ſerue as a Iudge. And for that
I ſpent all my youth in learning, and gaue my ſelfe greatly
in reading of auncient Hiſtories, and hauing ſéene and read
a great part thereof, did then immediately procure to know
and with all diligence did my beſt indeauour to vnderſtand
what had bene done in the Diſcouerie of the Indias, and in
the Conqueſt of the ſame, by the Portingales, with the intent
as aforeſayde, which was to make the ſame knowen,
and common to all men: by meanes whereof, and through
the inſtructions of ſundry Gentlemen and Captaines, many
things came to my knowledge, by ſuch perſons as were
then and there preſent, as well in the counſayle for the prouiſion
for that which ſhould be done, as alſo in the execution
thereof, and otherwiſe by many letters and pamphlets,
the which were written by men of great credite, and lykewiſe
examined as ſufficient witneſſes for better credite of
the worke. Moreouer, I did not onely vſe this dilygence in
the Indias, but after my comming to Portingale didde the
lyke. For as thoſe matters the which I meant to write
of, were many and of ſundrye orders, ſo it was neceſſarye
to enforme my ſelfe of the ſame by manye: and beſide that
thoſe that gaue me this inſtructions wer ſworn, yet I was
licenſed to preſent them as witneſſes. There were of them
that I ſought in the moſt part of Portingale: for what with
the great trauell of my perſon, and expences of my goodes,
for that they were ſeperated in ſundry parts, and in this I
haue ſpent the moſt part of my lyfe, forſomuch as this was
my onely recreation, hauing ioyned together all theſe informations,
ſince my being in the Vniuerſitie of Coimbro, in
your Highnes ſeruice, at ſuch time as I found my ſelfe not
occupied with the executing of my office, with great trouble
(not onely of the body, but alſo of the ſpirite) made an end
of this Booke with others, the which I doe humbly offer

vnto your Highnes, whome God (after manye and moſt
fortunate yeares, remayning in your place
the Prince) take and receiue you
from the ſenurie of the
earth, vnto the ioyes
of heauen.

                  ❧How the King Don Joan the ſecond
of that name, did ſend to ſeeke out by ſea and by
land the Eaſt India, and of the newes that was
brought him of the ſame. Cap. 1.
               
                  THIS King Don
Ioan the ſecond of
that name, & of the
Kings of Portingale,
the thirtéenth,
perceiuing that all
the Spices, Drugs,
Stones, and other
riches, which came
to Venice, were
brought out of a
certaine Prouince
of the Eaſt parte:
And as he was a
Perſonage of an
hautie ſtomacke and valiaunt minde, ſo was he deſirous to
inlarge his Kingdome, and increaſe the Chriſtian faith, and
therefore he determined to diſcouer by Sea, the Country,
from whence ſo great plentie of riches came, that thereby
his Subiects might be inriched, and his Kingdome of Portingale
enioy all ſuch commodities as came from thence to
Venice. Moreouer, to diſcouer the ſame Countrey, he was
the rather animated and enclined, for that he was giuen to
vnderſtand, that in the Eaſt India, where Chriſtians, which
were gouerned by a King of great power called Praesbiter

Ioan, with whom Don Ioan thought good to haue acquaintaunce,
and to know him by his Ambaſſadors, and the rather
for that he was reported to be a Chriſtian Prince:
And therefore conſulting with the Coſmographers of that
time, he gaue them in charge to procéede and goe forwarde
by example of others, which had ſayled along the Coaſt of
Guynee, which Coaſt was before that time diſcouered by
commaundement of the Prince his Vnckle,The order of Chriſt in Portingale giuē vnto Noble men & Gentlemen & to ſome that are made knights. Maſter of
the Order of Chriſt, who had ſent for that purpoſe, one Bartholome
Dyas, one of the Officers of his Storehouſe in
Lyſhborne, who did diſcouer that great & monſtrous Cape,
not knowen of our Aunceſtours, which is now called the
Cape of Buena eſperansa: And finding there matter of
great terrour and daungers, he paſſed beyond the ſame, one
hundred and fortie leagues, where, comming to a Riuer,
which he named Rio del infante, from thence he retourned
to Portingale. In this voyage, he gaue to the Ports, Herbours,
and Riuers, where he tooke in freſh water, theyr
names, which at this preſent they doe retaine. Likewiſe,
he erected there certaine markes with Croſſes, and with the
roiall Armes of Portingale, and the laſt that he erected, was
in a Rocke, the which they named, El pennol de la crus,
which ſtandeth fiftéene leagues on this ſide the foreſayde
Riuer. And from thence he retourned without hearing any
newes, or yet hauing any further intelligence of that India,
by reaſon all the Inhabitaunts along thoſe Coaſts bée almoſt
a ſauage and a wilde kinde of people, and of coulour
blacke.
               This voyage and intelligence, being intimated and

               The King neuertheleſſe continuing to proſecute to
effect his determination for diſcouerye of that India by
lande,Another iorney by lande attempted. did therevppon chooſe two of his owne ſeruauntes,
men of good knowledge, and dilygent in whatſoeuer they
were to be imployed, the one called Pedro de Couillian,
borne in the ſaide Village, and the other called Alonſo de
Payua, borne in the Towne of Caſtil Blanco, which did
verye well vnderſtande the language of Arabia, to whome
he tolde how that he had made choyce of them, as of perſons
apt to execute his pretence, which was to diſcouer
by lande as well the Countrey of Presbiter Ioan,
as alſo that, from whence the Drugges and Spices
come to Venice: Giuing them in charge, and that earneſtlye
to make dilygent enquirye; and gather certaine
knowledge whether that from the Cape of Buena Eſperansa
forwarde there were anye Nauigation to the Eaſt
India, and that they ſhoulde ſet downe all thinges
they founde neceſſarye to bée knowen, or that they
coulde by anye poſſible meane learne or gather of the
ſame for certaintye: Commaunding alſo a Sea Carde
to bée giuen them, which was taken out of a Ma
                     •
                  pe
of the whole worlde, by a Maiſter of Arte, called
Calſadilla, Biſhoppe of Vyſeu, who was a good Aſtronomer.
               Moreouer, hée gaue them a Letter of credite, whereby
they might bée ſuccoured and protected from, and in,
daungers of death, and in caſes of neceſſitie and want
of money, in whatſoeuer Kingdomes and Countreyes
theyr happe ſhoulde be to trauayle. And for theyr charges,
hée commaunded to giue them foure hundreth
Crownes out of the Cheſt of the Orcherd of Almeryn:
Of which ſumme, they tooke as much as they déemed would
ſuffice for theyr expence, vntill they came to Valencia in
Aragon, putting the reſidue in the Ba
                     •
                  cke of Bartelme
Florentine to be deliuered them there: and ſo he gaue them
the bleſſing of God and his, in the preſence of the King

                  Don Manuel, who at that time was Duke of Veſa.
               
               After this they departed from the Village of Santaren
the ſeauenth day of May, in the yeare of our Lord, a thouſand
foure hundred foure ſcore and ſeauen, and came to Naples
vpon Saint Iohns daye the ſame yeare, from whence
they were ſet forward on their way, by Coſmo de Medicis
ſonnes, and ſo went they from thence to the Rhoodes, of
which Religion, wer then none other but Portingales. And
from the Rhoodes they went to Alexandria, from thence
to the Cayro, as Merchaunts, and from thence in the companie
of certaine Moores of Feez, and Tremencen, they
came to Toro, which is a place that hath his harbour in
the Straights of the red Sea in the Coaſt of Arabia, at the
foote of the Mountaine Sinay, where they vnderſtood mainie
matters of the Indias, and of the trade thoſe places had out
of the Straightes to Calicut: and therevpon they trauailed
to another place in the ſelfe ſame Sraightes of the
Redde Sea, ouer the Coaſte of Aethiopia, from
whence they went to Edin: And for that it was out of
the waye to the Indies, they parted companye and ſeuered
themſelues: Alonſo de Payua remained to go ouer by land
to the Emperour of Aethiopia,
                  Presbiter Ioan by errour, is the verye Emperour of Aethiopia. which is he, whom we before
haue named vpon errour Presbiter Ioan: for the certaintie
is, this is he of whom Marco Paulo maketh mention
in his booke, who gouerneth all the Indies, and whoſe
Countrey ioyneth vnto the great Cam of Catayo, where in
a battaile betwéene them fought, the ſaide Preſter Ioan
was vanquiſhed and dyed. And ſo thencefoorth finally ended
his Kingdome, ſo that in theſe dayes, there is in trueth
none of that name or race that raigneth or gouerneth. It
is to be vnderſtoode, that Alonſo de payua did verely beléeue,
that this Emperour of Aethiopia, was this ſuppoſed
Presbiter Ioan, by reaſon he was informed and
had intelligence that the ſame Emperour was a Chriſtian,
and the People of his Kingdome were alſo
Chriſtians, as héereafter I ſhall declare, when occaſion ſhall
ſerue.
               
                  
For which cauſe, I am in opinion, y• 
                  Alonſo did depart towards
his Court, taking order and determining with Pedro
de Couillian, that at a time appointed they ſhuld méet
in the great Cayro: This conference and determination
betwéene them ſo had and accorded vpon, Pedro de Couillian
went towards the Indies in a ſhippe of the Moores of
Cananor, and béeing come to the Indies, he went to the
towne of Calicut, and to the Ilands of Goa, where hée gathered
perfect information & intelligence of the ſpices which
they haue in the Indies, and of the commodities which
come from other places, and of the lyke ſorte of Townes
which were ther in the Indies, of all which he ſet downe the
names in the Card he carried with him, albeit ill written.
And after he had ſéene thoſe places, he went to Sofala, where
he gathered knowledge of the great Iland of San Laurenſo,
which the Moores doe call La yſla de la Luna: And ſéeing
the people of Sofala, to be blacke as thoſe of Guynee
are, he therevpon ſurmiſed that all that coaſt was ſubdued,
and that they might goe by Sea to the Indias, and therefore
returning thence, he went to Ormuſe, and ſo to Cayro,
where hée vnderſtoode that Alonſo de Payua was
dead: And béeing deſirous to returne to Portingale, by
chaunce hée mette with two Iewes of Spaine, the one called
Raby Abraham, borne in Veſa, the other Ioſeph,
borne in Lamego: Theſe after the departure of Pedro Couillian
and Alonſo de Payua, from Portingale, tolde the
King Don Ioan, that they had béene in the Cayro, & vnderſtoode
there much newes of Ormuſe, and of theyr tract had
with and into the Indies: Wherevpon the King ſent letters
by Raby Abraham to Pedro Couillian, and to Alonſo
de Payua, declaring that his pleaſure was, they ſhoulde
retourne in the companie of thoſe Iewes, if they had ſéene
all thoſe thinges, whereof hée gaue them charge and
commaundement, at their departure: if not, that then they
ſhoulde ſende by thoſe Iewes a declaration, and true reporte
what they had ſéene, and had intelligence of: And
moreouer that they ſhoulde procure to atteine to the ſight

of Presbiter Ioan, and alſo ſhewe and informe what they
coulde concerning Ormuſe to Raby Abraham for that hée
had ſworne by his lawe neuer to retourne to Portingale,
vnleſſe hée firſt ſawe the ſame: Vppon receipte of which
letters and meſſage, Pedro de Couillian his purpoſe of retourning
to Portingale was then ſtayed: And therefore he
forthwith diſpatched Ioſeph with letters to the King, his
Lorde and Maiſter, wherein hée related and fully declared
in euery reſpect what hée had ſéene in the Indias, and of Sofala:
and lykewiſe hée ſent the Carde in which all the
Townes names were put downe, that hée had ſéene: Informing
alſo the King Don Ioan, that the Emperour of
Aethiopia is hée who is ſuppoſed to bée ye 
                  Presbiter Ioan:
But I am of opinion, that in Portingale remaineth this
name of Emperour of Aethiopia, for that in his kingdome
hée is not called by the name of Preſter Ioan, as I will
heereafter declare: When Ioſeph was departed, Pedro de
Couillian, with Raby Abraham, went towards Ormuſe,
and thence to the ſtraights of the red ſea, and hauing ſhewed
to the ſame Raby thoſe places and ſcituation therof, Pedro
Couillian then ſent him to Portingale, with letters to
the king, importing what hée ſhewed him, and how that hée
himſelfe was determined to make his voyage to Presbiter
Ioan, and after this purſuing that his intent accordinglye,
he came to the preſence of ye Emperour, that then ther reigned
and gouerned, whoſe name was Alexander, of whome
hée was verye well receiued,The king of Portingales letters deliuered to the Emperour of Aethiopia and when hée had preſented
vnto him the letters of the king Don Ioan, he accepted
the ſame verye ioyfully, in that they came from a Chriſtian
Prince ſo farre diſtaunt from his Countrie: Howbeit
hée gaue to the ſame little credite, and yet neuertheleſſe hée
gaue vnto Pedro de Couillian, great honour and gifts: and
when hée was in readyneſſe to departe thence, and expected
liſence for the ſame, which hée had requeſted, and ſhould
haue béene graunted him, the Emperour then deceaſed: after
whome ſuccéeded in the Empire another named Nahu,
hée coulde not by him bée lycenſed to depart thence, neither

yet of his ſonne Dauid, who was Emperour alſo, and
ſuccéeded Nahu: ſo that Pedro de Couillian, remayned in
that Countrie, and neuer after returned into Portingale,
neyther yet the King Don Ioan euer hearde or vnderſtoode
more of him, and therefore ſuppoſed him to bée dead. Onely
there remaineth the information of his trauailes, which
hée had ſette downe and written in the letters which the
Iewes carryed: After this came to Liſhborne a Frier out
of the Countrie of Presbiter Ioan, to whome the king ſhewed
great curteſie, and vpon whoſe reporte, and great relation
made of that countrie, the king then determined to procéede
in, and follow the diſcouering of the Indias by Sea,
and therefore hée commaunded two little Shippes to bée
made, committing the charge of that preparation, and appointing
for ouerſéer or ſurueiour of the Timber then cut
for that purpoſe, one Ioan de Braganca his ſeruaunt borne
in the woodes, in a village called Daluor, and was brought
to Liſhborne to the houſe of the Myna, in the yeare of our
Lord a thouſande foure hundred nintie fiue, the fiue and
twentie daye of October in the ſame yeare: and afterward
did ſuccéede in that Kingdome, the moſt high king of glorious
memorye Don Manuel, by whome alſo it appeared
that he was there elected by diuine prouidence for diſcouery
of thoſe Countries and Prouinces, whereby the Chriſtian
faith is ſo greatly increaſed and inlarged, & the róyall houſe
of Portingale ſo mightely honoured, and the ſubiectes of the
ſame ſo plenteouſly enriched.
            
            
               ¶How King Don Manuel the firſt of that name,
prepared after the deceaſe of King Don Ioan, to
diſcouer the Indias by one Vaſco de la Gama,
and by other Captaines, and howe they departed
from Lyſhborne.
Chap. 2.
               
                  
                  THE King Don Ioan béeing dead, Don
Manuel then ſuccéeded him, in whome appeared
a higher ſtomacke, and more valyauntneſſe
of minde (for atteining of things
impreagnable & making triall, and executing
matters that paſſed common capacitie of
man, and aboue the retch of naturall knowledge) then was
in Alexander the greate. Don Manuel now come to the
crowne, and earneſtly minded & bent to proſecute that which
his predeceſſour Don Ioan had begun, for diſcouering of the
Indias, and being therein greatly furthered by ſuch matter,
order, and intelligence, as he found, and were left by the late
king for Nauigation to thoſe farre countries: he then commaunded
that Fernan Lorenſo, Treaſurer of the houſe of
the Myna, ſhould cauſe to be made and prepared of the timber
which was bought in king Iohns time, two ſhippes,
wherevnto after they were finiſhed, he gaue the names, to
the one, the Angel Gabriel, being of an hundred and twentie
tunne: and to the other Saint Raphael, a ſhippe of one
hundred tunne. And to goe in the companie of theſe ſhips,
the King then bought of a Pilot that was borne in Lagus,
called Berrio, a Caruell of fiftie tunne, which had and bare
the ſelfe name of the Pilot: Moreouer he bought a ſhip of
two hundred tunne, of one Ayres Correa. Theſe Shippes
thus made readie and prepared, and the king then being in
Monte mayor the new, with his firſt wife the Quéene, Dō
                     na
Izabel, in the yeare a thouſand foure hundreth nintie ſeuen,
he then gaue the chiefe Captaine ſhippe of this voyage
vnto the Indias to Vaſco de la Gama his ſeruaunt, who alſo
before was ſeruaunt to Don Ioan, & borne in the towne
of Synis, a harbour towne in the fields of Dorricke. The
ſame was a man experimented in matters of the Sea, and
of Nauigation, wherein he had done to this kingdome great
ſeruice. And foraſmuch as he was a man of greate courage
and valure, and therefore very apt and likely to atteine and
atchieue the end, y• was by the king deſired, the king then accordingly
in preſēce of many noble perſonages, to his great

praiſe, and no leſſe incouragement, commaunded him, when
he gaue him the charge of that iourney, earneſtly alſo requiring
him, to aunſwere and ſatiſfie the expectation and credit
he had conceiued of him and repoſed in him, which if he did,
he would then very largely reward that his indeauour, and
trauell, and ſo liberally deale towardes him, as he ſhoulde
finde himſelfe ſatiſfied for that his dilligence and ſeruice imployed:
and for ſome proofe of thoſe princely and louing
ſpeaches, he then beganne to make performaunce of parte
thereof, at that verye inſtant, giuing him an Encommenda,
with money to put himſelfe in a readineſſe for that
voiage: And for to goe with him, the king alſo diſpatched
one Paulo de la Gama, brother to the Captaine Generall,
and one Nicholas Coello, both of them the kings ſeruants,
and men méete and apt for whatſoeuer matter of enterpriſe
or cauſe of valiauntneſſe: Moreouer he appointed one Bartholome
Dyas, to goe with them in a Caruell to the Myna:
And for that in the ſhips of warre, ſufficient victualls
for the people in the ſame, could not be carried further then
to a place called Saint Blaze, where they muſt of courſe
take in freſh water, the king gaue commaundement that the
ſhippe of Ayres Correa ſhould goe loaden with victuals vnto
that place in the companie of the Fléet, and there to take
out the ſame, and then to burne the ſaid Ship. The Captaine
Generall thus informed, and diſpatched, departed with
the other Captaines from the Kings court, towardes Liſhborne,
                  The number of perſōs in this voyage.
where the ſhips being in a readineſſe, he imbarked his
companie, béeing one hundred fortie and eight perſons, in
Belen, one league from Liſhborne, vpon the Saturday being
the eight day of Iulye, in the yeare of our Lorde God, a
thouſand foure hundred nintie and ſeauen. At which imbarking
all the religious men of our Ladie Church in Belen,
which is a Moneſtrarie of Saint Hierome, went in Proceſſion
bare footed, and in their cowles with waxe Candles in
their hands praieng, and the moſt part of the people of Liſhborne
with them, al of them wéeping and pitieng thoſe that
ſo imbarked themſelues, ſuppoſing they ſhuld all die in that

ſo aduentrous and daungerous voiage, as in déede the p
reſumption
and common opinion thereof was greate, and
no leſſe to be adiudged of The Generall and other his Captaines
with their people ſo imbarked; and by the multitude
and companie then preſent, commended to God and good fortune,
they forthwith made ſaile and departed: The Captaine
Generall went in the Ship called Saint Gabriel, hauing
Pilot for ye ſame, one Pedro de Alanquer, which was Pilot
with Bartholome Dyas, when he went to diſcouer ye riuer
called El ryo del ynfante: The brother of the Captaine generall,
went in the ſhip called S. Raphael: Nicholas Coello
went in the Caruell Berrio, & one Gonſalo Gomes, ſeruaunt
to the Captaine generall, went for Captaine of the
ſhip that carried their victuals. Thus being ſet forward and
vnder ſaile, the Captaine generall commaunded, that if by
any happe whatſoeuer, they ſhould bée ſeuered and looſe
each other, they ſhuld euery one make, and kéepe, their roote
or courſe to Cabo Verde, where they would ioyne themſelues
together againe. And ſo following their voiage, they
came within eight dayes after to the ſight of the Ilandes
of the Canaries, from whence going ouer againſt the Riuer
called Ryo de Oro, the night did growe ſo darke, and
ſuch great tempeſt and ſtorme roſe as they loſt each other,
and therefore they retourned their courſe towardes Cabo
Verde, and Paulo de la Gama, Nicholas Coello, Bartholome
Dyas, and Gonſalo Gomes, hauing met, and after eight
daies failing together, they came to ſight of their Captaine
Generall, vpon the wedneſdaye in the Euening, and ſaluting
him with many ſhot of ordinaunce, and with ſound of
Trumpets, they ſpake vnto him, each of them heartely reioyſing,
and thanking God for their ſafe méeting, and good
fortune in this their firſt brunt of daunger and perill: The
next day béeing the twenteth day of Iuly, the Captaine general
with all his Fléet, attained vnto the Ilands of Sancty
Ago: wher cōming to anker in y• play de Santa Maria, they
remained there ſeuen daies, taking in ſuch water as they
had néed of, & repairing the yards of their ſhips and other

harmes they had receiued in the ſtorme paſt. Tewſday being
the third day of Auguſt, the Captaine Generall departed
thence, following his courſe to the Eaſt, but firſt before
his departure he tooke his leaue of Bartholome Dyas,
                  Bartholome Dyas returneth into Portingale who
returned into Portingale: And going towarde the Cape
of Buena Eſperansa, with all the ſhips of his companie, hée
entered the goulfe into the Sea, and from thence ſailed all
Auguſt, September, and October, in which time they ſuſteined
many and great tempeſts, or rather torments of outragious
windes and raine, ſo that they expected nothing but
preſent death, which ſtill was repreſented before them by
view of the manifolde daungers and perills, they preſently
then ſawe, and whereof they were forced to abide the euenture:
Béeing thus perplexed, God of his diuine goodneſſe
recomforted them, for vpon the ſaturdaye, being the fourth
day of Nouember at nine of the clocke in the fore-noone,
they ſawe land, whereat they greatly reioyſed, and all the
Captaines béeing together, they then ſaluted the Generall,
all of them apparelled in their beſt araie, and hauing decked
and garniſhed their ſhippes with Flagges accordingly, they
drew néere the land as the generall had commaunded, who
was deſirous to haue landed: Howbeit for that they did
not know the land, he commaunded them to caſt about a
ſea boord, and ſo they paſſed along by the ſame vntill tewſdaie
following, at what time they came to perfect viewe
and ſight of the land, perceiuing the ſame to lye lowe, and
that there was a great bay, which as it was a conuenient
place for the ſhips, ſo he commanded them to fall to an anker
there, of purpoſe to take in water: And afterward they
named it the Iland of Sancta Haelena.
                  Deſcription of the people & manners of Saint Helens Iland. The people of the
countrie within the ſaid Iland, as our men afterward found
the ſame: bée lyttle men, ill fauoured in the face, and of colour
blacke: and when they did ſpeake, it was in ſuch
manner as though they did alwayes ſigh, theyr apparell is
of beaſtes ſkinnes made after the manner of the French
Cloakes, they truſte vp and hide theyr members in certeine
Caſes made of woode verye well wrought.
               
                  
They haue for armes or weapons certaine ſtaues of an
Oke trée bathed or toaſted with fire, at the endes whereof
are hornes of beaſts, ſomwhat burnt or hardened with fire,
alſo ſeruing them for ſwoords, and wherewith they do hurt
their enimie. Theſe people doe mainteine themſelues with
rootes of hearbes, with Sea Woulfes, and Whale fiſh, of
which the countrie there hath great plentie, and likewiſe of
ſea crowes, and ſea mewes: Alſo they doe eate of beaſtes,
which they call Gazelas, and of doues, and other beaſts and
birds which they haue in the land: They kéepe alſo dogs as
thoſe ben of Portingale, barking after the ſame manner: The
Generall thus lyeng at Anker, commaunded to goe rounde
about the Ilande, to ſée if there were anie riuer of ſwéete
water, and finding none, he then ſent Nicholas Coello in
his boate along the coaſt to ſéeke out water, which he found
fowre leagues of from thence, the which he named Sancty
Ago, from whence the whole Fléete prouided themſelues of
freſh water. The next day the Generall and the other Captaines,
and ſome of their companie went a ſhore, intending
to ſée and view what manner of people they were, that inhabited
that countrie or land, and whether they coulde informe
him how farre from thence the Cape of Buena Eſperansa
was, which he knew not, neither was the head or
chiefe Pilot of that voyage of any certeintie which it was,
for that in the voyage, wherein hée went before with Bartholome
Dyas, he departed in the morning from the Cape
into the Sea, and paſt the ſame in the night, with a forewinde,
and at his firſt going, came not néere the Shore:
By reaſon wherof he did not know the land, notwithſtanding,
hée coniectured and déemed it not aboue thirtie leagues
diſtaunt from thence at the vttermoſt: The Generall being
diſimbarked and come to land, and walking there he ouertooke
a man, one of the inhabitaunts of the ſame, who was
going to gather honny at the foote of a buſh, where the Bées
made the ſame without anie hiue, with this man, ye general
returned vnto his ſhip, right well contented, thinking he had
gotten by him an interpreter, but it happened not ſo for ther

was not any of that company could vnderſtand him: The
Generall commaunded to giue him meate, and he did both
eate and drinke of all that was giuen him, and when they
ſaw he vnderſtood none of their languages, nor any of them
had any vnderſtanding of his, he was the next daye ſet vppon
the ſhore well apparelled, from whence he went as it
appeared, amongſt others his countrey men, for that y• next
day then following, (vpon ſhew of himſelfe to them) there
came about the number of fiftéene of his Countrey men,
where our ſhips were: At ſight of which the Captaine generall
went to lande, carrieng with him Spice, Golde, and
Pearle, to make triall, whether thoſe people had any knowledge
of the ſame, or of any part thereof: but by the lyttle
eſtimation they ſeemed to make of thoſe things, it appeared
they had no knowledge of the ſame. Then they gaue them
bells, little rings of tinne, and counters, and of theſe things
they wer very glad, and from thence forward vnto the next
Saterday following, very many of them repayred to our
Fléete, and thoſe people ſo returning to their Townes, one
of our men deſirous to ſée the ſame, and to viewe the order
and manner of their liues, craued then licence of the Generall
to goe with them, whoſe petition, albeit he was verye
vnwilling to condeſcend vnto, yet vanquiſhed by importunitie,
he graunted the ſame. Fernan Veloſo (for ſo was his
name that was licenſed) then going in their company, they
tooke a Sea Woulfe, which they roſted at the foote of a hill,
and ſupped altogethers:Treaſon by theſe men imagined againſt ours. after which it then appeared, that
they of that Countrey had armed themſelues, and practiſed
treaſon againſt our men: for ſo ſoone as they had ſupped,
they cauſed Fernan Veloſo, to returne to our Fléete againe,
which was hard by, and when he was departed from
them, they followed and came after him a little and a little,
the manner whereof, Fernan eſpieng & fearing, he therefore
haſted to the water ſide, and hailed to our ſhips: The
Generall then being at ſupper, and hearing that call, and looking
out to landward, ſawe thoſe ſauage people comming
after him, and preſently imagined they meant him harme,

and therefore foorthwith he commaunded the whole Fléete
to put themſelues in battaile araye, and he himſelfe with
certaine others, went to landward without anye weapons,
déeming verely that thoſe blacke men meant him no harme,
nor would offer anye force: and indéede when they ſawe
our boates comming to the ſhoreward, they began to runne
away, with a great clamour and outcrie, and ſo did manye
others alſo which lay ſecretly hidden amongſt certeine buſhes
there, which policie they vſed to traine our men the rather
to lande, for when ours were diſimbarked and landed,
they then returned and furiouſly ſet vpon them, ſhooting
their darts, and vſing their other weapons in ſuch ſort, as
they inforced our men to retire to their boates and imbarke
themſelues, and that in haſt, taking with them Fernan Veloso,
which being done, the Negroes retourned to theyr
townes, hauing hurt the Captaine generall & thrée others,
who afterward remaining in that road foure dayes, coulde
not ſée any moe of thoſe people, and therefore could not vſe
any reuenge, for the damage they had done them.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall doubled the Cape of Buena
eſperansa, and what hapned vntill they paſſed the
Riuer called El Ryo del Infante. Cap. 3.
               
                  THE Fléete hauing taken in freſh water
and fleſh which they néeded, the Generall
and the reſt then departed thence vpon the
Thurſday being the ſixtéenth daye of Nouember,
in the forenoone of the ſame daye,
making their waye into the Sea, with a
South ſouthweſt winde, and vpon the Saterdaye then next
following in the euening, he came within ſight of the Cape
of Buena eſperansa, and for that the winde was contrarye,
as being then Southweſt, and the Cape lyeng Northeaſt
Southeaſt, hée made his retourne into the Seawarde,

whileſt the daye did indure, and when the night came, hée
caſt about towards the ſhore, and ſo in that order he ſayled
vntill the Wenſdaye following, which was the twentith
day of Nouember in which time he doubled the Cape: And
going along the Coaſt with a fore winde, he paſſed with
great pleaſure of ſundry paſtimes, and in ſounding of the
trumpets in all their ſhips, chiefly hauing their whole confidence
in God, by whoſe diuine furtherance, they hoped to
finde out, and attaine to that which they ſought for: So
paſſing in this ſort along that Coaſt, they ſawe vppon the
land great ſtore of Cattell, whereof ſome were large, ſome
ſmall, but all of them were growen and fat: Howbeit ther
appeared to them no Townes within this lande, by reaſon
that along thoſe Coaſts ther are none ſcituated: but further
within the ſame, there be Townes and Villages inhabited,
the houſes whereof are all of earth couered with ſtrawe.
The people are of colour ſomewhat blacke, and be apparailed
as thoſe of the Countrey of Sancta Helena, ſpeaking
the ſelfe ſame language, and vſing the ſelfe ſame ſorte of
darts, with ſome other weapons alſo for their defence, and
anoyaunce of their enimie. This Countrey is verye pleaſaunt
with Trées and Waters, and ioyning to this Cape
on the South ſide, there is a great Harbour, which reacheth
into the Lande ſixe leagues, and at the entering it
containeth well as much more. The Cape of Buena eſperansa
béeing thus doubled, the Captaine Generall foorthwith
vpon the Sundaye after,The vvatering of S. Blaze which was Saint Katherins
day, came to the Watering of Saynt Blaze, which is thrée
ſcore leagues beyonde the Cape, béeing a verie great Baye,
and paſſing good for all Windes, except onelye the North
winde. The people héere are ſomewhat blacke of coulour,
they couer themſelues with ſkinnes, they fight
with Dartes of woode toſted or hardened in the fire,
and vſe for Swoordes, Hornes and Bones of Beaſtes,
and alſo they vſe Stones to defende themſelues agaynſt
theyr Enimies. In this Lande bée manye Elephauntes
and great, alſo Oxen manye both large of

ſtature, and very fat, whereof ſome haue no hornes: and
vpon the fatteſt and faireſt of the ſame, the people do vſe to
ride, ſadling them with pannells ſtuffed with the ſtrawe of
Rye, as the manner is in Spayne, and vpon the ſame they
put a certaine frame of woode, and ſo vſe it as a ſaddle to
ride vppon, putting through the noſes of ſuch of them as
they will ſell, a péece of woode, of that kinde whereof they
make their arrowes. In this Harbour thrée Croſſebow ſhot
from the ſhore,Sea vvolfs moſt firce & terrible beaſts within the Sea, lieth a Rocke, in the which
there be many Sea Woulfes, which are as large in bignes
as great Beares, they be terrible, hauing great and long
téeth, alſo ſo wilde and fierce, that they do forcible ſet vpon
men: their ſkinnes be ſo hard that no ſpeare can pearce the
ſame, albeit it be forced vpon it with great ſtrength and valure:
they are like vnto Lions, and their little ones crye
like young Goates, there be ſo many of them in y• Rocke,
that when our men went thether of pleaſure one day, they
ſaw of them at that inſtant, the number of thrée thouſand
little and great. In this Rocke alſo be many Stares, which
are as great as Duckes, but they doe not flye, by reaſon
they haue no feathers in their wings, and they braye lyke
vnto an Aſſe. The Captaine Generall being come to this
Port or Baye, and lieng at Anker there, cauſed the ſhippes
which carried their victualls, to be diſcharged thereof, and
beſtowed the ſame in the others, commaunding thoſe Veſſells
to be then burned, as it was ordained and commaunded
by the King in that behalfe. In doing whereof, & other
things alſo which were neceſſarye and néedfull to be looked
vnto, and foreſéene, for their more ſafetie in the reſt of their
voyage, they remained ten dayes in that place, where, vpon
the Friday next after the Captaine generall and the reſt had
ariued, ther appeared vnto them, about the number of foure
ſcore and ten men of that Countrey, ſome along vppon the
landes, and ſome vpon the top of their Mountaines, which
when the Generall ſawe, he and other the Captaines went
to the ſhore ward, and all the company of the ſhippes went
armed in their boates, carrieng ordinaunce with them, as

fearing the lyke chaunce y• happened to them in the Ilande
of Sancta Helena, the Boates then drawing neere to the
ſhore, the Generall threw on lande little belles, which the
Negroes tooke vp, and ſome of them came ſo neere vnto
him, that he gaue them the bells into their owne handes,
whereat he wonderfully meruailed, for that Bartholome
Dyas had informed before, that when he was there, they did
run away, and wold not be allured to come ſo néere view.
The Generall therfore finding & perceiuing contrary to his
expectation, the gentleneſſe of thoſe blacke people, hée then
leapt out on lande with his men, making exchaunge of certaine
red night caps with the Negroes for Bracelets of Iuory
which they had, and ſo for that time departed. The
Saterday next after came to the number of two hundreth
blacke men: and more, ſome little, ſome great, bringing with
them twelue Oxen and foure ſhéepe, and as our men went
on ſhore, they began to play vpon foure Flutes accordingly
with foure ſundry voyces, the Muſicke whereof ſounded
very well, which the Generall hearing, commaunded the
trumpets to ſound, and ſo they daunced with our men. In
this paſtime and feaſting, and in buying their Oxen and
ſhéepe, that daye paſſed ouer, and in the ſelfe ſame ſort, vpon
the Sunday following, 
                     •
                  un
                     •
                  ry of the ſame, and many moe
with them as well men as women, came againe bringing
with them many Kine, and hauing ſolde one Oxe, our men
ſaw certaine little Nigroes, which were hidden in certayne
buſhes, who had with them the weapons of the greater
ſort of men: wherein our men coniectured, that ſome treaſon
was ment to them, and therfore the Generall commanded
our people to retire to another place, which was of
more ſecuritie, and thoſe blacke men went all along the
ſhore directlye againſt our boates, vntill they came to the
place where ours diſimbarked themſelues, and went vppon
the lande in armour. The Nigroes then ioyned themſelues
as though they intended to fight, which the Generall perceiuing,
and not wilyng to doe them anye harme, did then
retyre, imbarking himſelfe, and for to feare them, commanded

two braſſe péeces of Ordinaunce to be ſhot off, whereat
they were amazed,The little Nigroes made more afeard then hurt and ranne away without any order,
leauing their weapons behinde them. After this, the Captaine
generall, cauſed to be carried on the ſhore, a certaine
marke or Piller, with the King of Portingales Armes, and
a Croſſe, which being there ſet and erected, the Nigroes pulled
downe the ſame our men yet being there. Theſe dayes
thus paſſed ouer, the Captaine generall with the reſt of the
Fléete departed thence towards the Riuer called, Ryo del
infante, vpon the Friday being the eight day of Nouember,
which was the Feaſt daye of the conception of our Lady,
and in ſailing forward on their voyage, ther aroſe ſo great
a ſtorme with a forewinde, vpon the daye of Saint Luke,
that our whole Fléete did runne with there ſmall ſayles,
and that alſo verye low. In this courſe they loſt the company
of Nicholas Coello, howbeit the next night after they
all met, and ioyned together againe. Now hauing paſt and
ſailed through this great ſtorm, or rather torment of wind,
which then was ceaſed, the Captaine Generall, vppon the
ſixtéenth daye of December did diſcouer lande, which were
certaine ſmall Rockes, being diſtaunt from the Harbour of
Saint Blaze thréeſcore leagues, and fiue leagues alſo from
the other part of the Rocke called De la cruze, where Bartholome
Dyas did erect his laſt marke: from which place
to the Riuer Del Infante are fiftéene leagues. This Countrey
is very pleaſant and ſightly in viewe, and in the ſame
is great ſtore of Cattell, and the further our Fléete ſayled
on that Coaſt, the better and higher the Trées were, all
which things our men might well perceiue and diſcerne, by
reaſon they went ſo néere the ſhore with their ſhips. And
vpon the Saterday they paſt hard by, and within ſight of the
Rocke De la cruze, and for that they were then come ſo far
forward as the Riuer Del infante, they were loath to paſſe
the ſame, and thereof taking counſell all the next night,
they went ſomewhat wide from the Coaſt, with a forewinde,
vntill Euenſong time, and then the Winde came
to the Eaſt, which was right againſt them, wherefore the

Captaine generall made to Seawarde, going in ſuch
ſort, as ſometime he kept the Sea, and ſometime droue towards
the lande, vntill the Tueſday being the twentith of
December, at the ſetting of the Sunne, the winde then comming
to the Weſt, which was a forewinde, and whether
to attayne to haue knowledge of the Lande they conſulted
all that night, which were beſt to doe. The next daye at
tenne of the Clocke in the fore noone, they came to the
Rocke aforeſayde, which is thrée ſcore leagues a ſtearne the
place, wherevnto they minded to goe.
               This Rocke, is the cauſe of the great Currents that
are there, and the ſelfe ſame daye the Fléete through paſſed
the ſame Courſe, with a great forewinde, which had
alſo indured them thrée or foure dayes, and wherewith they
ranne through thoſe Currents, which greatlye they feared,They ſafely paſſed the dāgerous currents
and were in doubt to haue done. Theſe daungerous
Currents, thus ſafelye and happelye paſſed without loſſe
or damage, they all were very glad and ioyfull, that theyr
good Fortune was to haue paſſed the ſame in manner as
Bartholome Dyas before that time had accordinglye done.
Wherefore the Captaine generall, béeing animated and
encouraged with this his great good lucke and Fortune,
and after thankes giuen to God for the ſame, did then
ſaye, that hée verelye beléeued, that it was Gods good
will and pleaſure that the Indias ſhould be founde.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall came to the Lande,
called, La terra de la buena gente, and after
went to the Riuer, called, Ryo de las buenas ſennales:
how hee brought theyr ſhippes on
grounde, and of the great ſickneſſe our people
had after they arriued there. Chap. 4.
               
                  
                  THus following their voyage, they perceiued
that vpon Chriſtmas daye, they had diſcouered
along the Coaſt, thrée ſcore and t
                     •
                  nne
leagues to the Eaſtward, which was the
waye he carryed with him in his Regiſter,
and wherein the Indias are: And héere
the Fléete went along vpon the Sea, without taking land,
ſo farre, that they began to want, and haue lacke of water
for to drinke, and were inforced to dreſſe their meate with
ſalt water, ſo that no man of that Fléete had then allowaunce
of water to drinke, more then one pinte a day. Howbeit
vpon the Friday being the eleuenth day of Ianuary, in
the yeare of our Lord God. 1498. drawing néere the lande,
they went out in their boates along the Coaſt to take view
thereof, and ſo paſſing by the ſame, they ſaw many Nigroes
with a great company of women, all of them of great ſtature,
which went along the Sea ſide, and when the Captain
generall ſaw and perceiued, that they ſhowed themſelues
to bée a people, flexible to ciuilitie, and of a quiet diſpoſition,
hée commaunded one of our men called Martin Alonſo,
who coulde ſpeake manye languages of the Nigroes,
and one other with him, to leape out on Lande, and to
goe to them, which immediatelye thoſe two perſons did:
and at theyr comming to the ſame blacke People, they
were of them verye well receyued, and eſpeciallye of the
chiefe perſon or Gouernour of the ſame, to whome, our
Generall viewing his and theyr manner of courteſie,A revvard ſent by ye Generall to a Nigro.
foorthwith ſent a Iacket, a payre of Hoſe, and a Cappe,
beeing all redde, and a Bracelet of Copper, of which
things he was very glad, and rendered great thankes to the
Generall for the ſame, ſaieng: that with a verye good
will, hée ſhoulde haue of gifte, anye thing he would deſire
or had néede off, that was to be had in his Countrey.
All which, Martin Alonſo, vnderſtanding theyr language
tolde to the Generall, who was verye ioyfull that

by his interpretation, thoſe people and ours might of each
other haue vnderſtanding, giuing alſo at that inſtant licenſe
to ye ſame Alonſo & one moe of our men to goe with thoſe
people for one night to their Towne, at the requeſt of the
ſame gouernour, who verie earneſtly required the ſame.
The gouernour then apparelled himſelfe with thoſe Garments
which the Generall gaue him, and with great pleaſure
gaue commaundement to many of his chiefe men to
goe before and receiue him when he came to their towne:
The people as they went viewed and beheld with greate
pleaſure and admiration thoſe veſtures which our General
had giuen him, clapping their hands for ioy thereof, which
manner of gladſome reioyſing, they vſed thrée or foure
times, before they came to their towne: And after their entraunce
therein, they went round about the ſame, to the end
all the people and inhabitants thereof, might ſée and behold
thoſe giuen garments and ſtraunge arraie: Which béeing
done, the gouernour entered into his houſe where he commaunded
Alonſo and his companion to be well lodged, and
gaue to them for their ſupper a Hen euen ſuch as ours bée,
and Pap made of Mylyo, which is a kinde of graine of a
yeolow coulour, whereof alſo they make bread: This night
repaired many Nigroes to their lodging to ſée them: And
the next daie after the gouernour ſent them to their ſhips
with certaine Nigroes of his loden with hens, for the Captaine
Generall, who rendered thanks for the ſame, and required
by his interpretour, thoſe Nigroes, to ſaie vnto their
Gouernour, that he now ſaw and perceiued him to be a noble
man, or king of that countrie, & foraſmuch as the Generall,
and the reſt of our men in thoſe fiue daies wherein
they had houered vpon and viewed that Coaſt had no manner
domage done or offered them: and ſaw both many quiet
and gentle people there, & alſo many noble men, he gaue
to this land an apt name, calling it, The Land of good
people, in the Towne where Martyn Alonſo was, theyr
houſes bée made all of ſtrawe, and verie well furniſhed
within: The owmen be more in number, then the men:

for in the companie of fortie women there are no more but
twentie men: They carrie with them long bowes with arrowes
and darts of yron, and vpon their armes and legges
they weare many braceléets of Copper, and ſome péeces of
them in their haires. Alſo they carrie daggars, the hafts or
handles of Pewter, and the ſheathes of Iuorie, ſo that it is
manifeſt, that they haue in that Countrie plentie of copper
and tinne: Moreouer they haue great ſtore of Salt, which
they make of Salt water, carrieng the ſame from the Sea
ſide in gourds, and putting it into certeine Caues where
they make the Salt: Theſe kinde of people were ſo gladde
of the linnen that our men carried with them, and brought
with them thether, that they gaue for one ſhirt much Copper.
They alſo were ſo quiet amongeſt our men, that they
brought them water to their boates from a riuer which
was two Croſbowe ſhotte from the place where our men
tooke in the ſame, which riuer they call Ryo de Cobio:
From this place our Fléete departed the fiftenth daye
of Ianuarie,A nevv land diſcouered of curteous Moores and going vnder ſaile, did diſcouer land of an
other countrie which lyeth very lowe, wherein were trées
verie high and thicke, and ſo procéeding forward they diſcouered
or found a riuer which was verie open at the entering
of the ſame: And for that the Generall thought it neceſſarie
to reknowledge or haue notice of that Countrie, &
there to learne whether they might heare anye newes or
intelligence of the Indias, hée commaunded to come to an
Ankor, which was vpon the Thurſday, béeing ſeauen daies
before the end of Ianuarie, and the ſame night he with his
brother Nicholas Coello entered the riuer, and at the dawning
of the daye, did well perceiue the lande to bée lowe
and couered with water, hauing trées of great height, and
thicke loaden with ſundrie ſortes of fruites: Our men then
beholding the land, which was verie pleaſaunt, they ſawe
alſo certeine boates, at that preſent comming towardes
them, with men in the ſame, whereof the Generall was very
glad, ſuppoſing vppon ſight of thoſe people and view of
their countrie, in that manner, which argued they had ſome

knowledge and experience of the Sea, that therefore they
were not farre of from the Indias, or at leaſtwiſe could not
then goe far, but they ſhould heare newes of the ſame: when
the people with their boates came néere to our Fléete, our
men perceiued they were all blacke people, of good ſtature,
howbeit all naked, ſauing their priuie members, which wer
couered, with little péeces of linnen made of Bomebaſt or
Cotten, they came neere and entered into our ſhips without
any feare, and in ſuch ſorte vſed themſelues towardes our
men, as though they had ben of long acquaintance and familiaritie
with them: They were very well receiued of our
people of the Fléet, the Captaine Generall commanded the
ſame, and alſo that there ſhuld be giuen vnto them certeine
little Bels & other things, & he talked with them by ſignes,
for they did not vnderſtand any of Martin Alonſo his languages,
nor any other interpretour yt our men thē had: After
this their good interteinment they departed, and as it ſéemed
well liking of the ſame, they and many others with them
afterward returned in their boates to our ſhips, bringing
vnto them ſuch victuals as their countrie yéeldeth: They
in appearance ſhewed themſelues verie well contented with
our men, & as they came by water, ſo alſo did many others
of thoſe people repaire thether by land, & amongſt them women
of indifferent good beautie, eſpecially y• young maides,
which goe after the ſame ſort, that the men doe: They haue
in their lips thrée holes, and in euery hole a péece of tinne,
which they eſtéeme as a thing very gallant and gaye: They
tooke with them certeine of our men to make merrie at a
countrie towne there néere hand, and where they fet water
for our ſhips. And after the thrée daies ſpace that our Generall
was in that riuer,Tke curteſie & apparel of the noble mē of this Countrie. there came of curteſie two noble
men of that countrie to viſit him in their boates, whoſe apparell
was none other, then of the reſt, ſauing the péeces
of lynnen wherewith they couered their members, were
farre greater, then thoſe the common ſorte vſed, and one of
them ware vpon his head a tucke or kerchiefe wrought
with ſilke, and the other had a night cap of gréene Satten.

The Captaine Generall ſéeing thoſe men ſomewhat addicted
to cleanlineſſe was verie glad thereof, receiued them in
curteous manner, and commaunded to giue them meate,
and moreouer he gaue them apparell and certeine other
things, but it appeared by their countinaunces they ſmallye
or nothing at all eſtéemed thereof: Howbeit while
they remained in our Shippes, the Generall perceiued
by tokens and ſignes which a young man that came with
them then ſhewed, that their countrie was farre of thence,
and that they had ſéene as great ſhips as ours were, wherof
he greatly reioyſed, and all our people in like manner as
then verely hoping and thereby coniecturing, that the Indias
were néere to that place: which their hope and coniecture,
was alſo farre the more augmented and confirmed,
for that after thoſe noble men were gone to ſhore, they ſent
to the Fléete, certeine linnen cloth to ſell, which was made
of Cotten, vpon which alſo were certeine marks of Okar,
in reſpect of which good newes, and intelligence héere found,
and likely to enſue, the Captaine Generall gaue to this riuer
a name, calling it, The Riuer of the good tokens or
marks, and cauſed there a marke to be erected, calling the
ſame San Raphael, according with the name of the ſhippe
wherein hée was, and went that voyage. And foraſmuch as
he perceiued by the ſignes of the young man, that thoſe noble
men inhabited a Countrie farre thence, and that they
had ſéene ſhippes as greate as ours, hée thereby and vppon
other coniectures gathered, that their Countrie was néere to
the Indias, and ſo conſequently that the Indias was farre of
from that riuer where our ſhips then lay: wherefore conſulting
héereof, it was by him and the other Captaines then
determined vpon, that all the ſhippes ſhould be brought on
ground, which determination was executed accordinglye, &
the ſame ſhips repaired, dreſſed, and trimmed in all points
néedfull and neceſſarie: In dooing whereof they ſpent and
paſſed ouer two and thirtie daies,This ſicknes is called the Scurfe in which time our men
ſuſteined and paſſed ouer great troubles and tormentes of
minde, by occaſion of a ſickneſſe there happened amongeſt

them, which was thought to growe by meanes of the aire
of that countrie, for that the hands and féete of ſo many of
them, and alſo their gums in ſuch ſorte did ſwell, that they
could not eate, and the ſame ſo rotted, that the ſtinke which
came out of their mouthes was ſo great and peſtiferous,
that none could abide the ſauour therof, with this peſtilent
infection & ſicknes our men were greatly diſcomfited, & many
of them dyed thereof, which alſo put the reſt of the companie
in greate feare and perplexitie of minde: Yea, and
further would haue increaſed and aggrauated their griefes
of bodye and ſorrowes of minde, were it not that one De
Gama a man of good nature and condition had taken ſpeciall
care and vſed greate dilligence, for the recouerye of
their healths, and putting them in comfort: who continually
viſited the ſicke, and liberally departed vnto them ſuch
wholeſome and medicinable things, as for his owne bodye
hée had prouided, and carried with him, through whoſe good
counſell giuen, great pains taken, and franke diſtribution of
that he had, many of our men were recouerd, which would
otherwiſe haue died, and all the reſt thereby were greatly
recomforted.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine Generall with all his Fleete, came
to the Iland of Monſambicke. Chap. 5.
               
                  THe Fléet béeing furniſhed and prouided of
all things neceſſarie, the Captaine Generall
then mindfull of his voyage, departed
thence, vpon the Saturday, béeing the 24.
day of Februarie,three ſmal Ilands diſcouered not vvorth the entering. and the ſame day, and al
the night following, for that he was incalmed
and to auoide the ſhore, made way into the ſea: and vppon
Sunday by Euenſong time, our men diſcried thrée Ilands
a Seaboord, all of them being but little or ſmall, they
were diſtant one from another foure leagues: Two of them
were repleniſhed with great woords, & the third was plaine,
to arriue to theſe Ilands the Generall was not willing, for

that he ſawe or coniectured no cauſe to occaſion the ſame, &
therefore he ſtill kept the ſea, ſtaieng & comming to an ankor
alwaies as the night approched, which manner of courſe &
order he vſed and continued the ſpace of ſixe daies: And vppon
the thurſday being the firſt day of March towards euening,
our men came within ſight of foure Ilands, whereof
two were néere the ſhore, and the other two a Seaboord, &
for that they would not that night fall with them, they ſtil
kept the Sea, minding to paſſe betwéene them, as indéede
they did: Wherevpon the Captaine Generall determined &
commaunded that Nicholas Coello, by reaſon his ſhip was
leſſe then the others, ſhuld go firſt, & ſo going vpon the friday
within a certein harbour, which was betwéene ye maine
land & one of the Ilands, the ſaid Nicholas miſſed ye channell,
and ranne on ground, which daunger when our other
ſhips ſawe comming after, they did caſt then about, & went
backe, and as they were returned, they perceiued comming
out of that Iland, ſeauen or eight little boates vnder ſaile,
béeing diſtant from Nicholas Coello a good league: At ſight
of thoſe boates comming towards them, Nicholas Coello
and thoſe which were with him tooke great pleaſure, & for
ioye gaue a great crye, and at their repaire to them Coello
and they went to the General and ſaluted him, to whom the
ſame Coello ſayd: How ſay you ſir, héere is an other kinde
of people: wherevnto the Generall anſwered, that hée was
very glad of that good Fortune, and therewith commanded
to let them go a Seaboord with their boates, for that his
meaning was to beare with them to that Ilande from
whence they came, and there to come to an Ankor, of purpoſe
to vnderſtand what land that was, & whether amongeſt
thoſe people, he might heare or haue anye newes or certeine
intelligence of the Indias: yet notwithſtanding ye generals
cōmandement, they in their boats followed our ſhips,
alwaies making ſignes and calling to our men, therein to
ſtay and tarrie for them, wherefore the Captaine Generall,
with the other Captaines came to an Ankor, and ſo they in
their boates approched néere, and came to our Fléete: And

then by view of their perſons it appeared they were men of
a good ſtature and ſomewhat blacke. They were apparelled
in linnen cloth of Cotten, welted with ſundry colours, ſome
girdeled vnto their knées, and others carried the ſame vpon
their ſhoulders as cloaks, and vpon their heads they weare
a certeine kinde of tucks or kerchiefe ſomewhat wrought
with ſilke and gold thrid. They haue ſwoords and daggers
as the Moores doe vſe them, in their boates they brought
with them their inſtruments called Sagbuts. Theſe men
being thus come to our ſhips, they forthwith came a boord
the ſame with great opinion of aſſuraunce, euen as though
they had knowne our men a long time, and immediatlye
began to be conuerſant, and very familiar with them, vſing
their ſpeaches which they vttered in the language of Algarauia,
and would not be knowne they were Moores: The
Generall commaunded to giue them meate, & they did both
eate and drinke with a good wil, of whatſoeuer was giuen
them: And béeing aſked at commaundement of the General
by one Fernan Aluares (who could ſpeake yt language) what
land that was, they anſwered that it apperteined to a great
king which was before,The Iland of Monſā
                     bick, vvith the tovvn of Merchandiſe. & how that Iland was called Mō
                     ſambicke,
and the towne there full of Merchantes, which
haue traficke with the Moores of the Indias, who bring thether
ſiluer, linnen cloth, pepper, ginger, ſiluer ringes, many
pearles, and rubie ſtones, and that out of another Countrie,
which remained behinde, they doe bring them golde: Declaring
further that if our men would enter into the Harbour
there, they would bring them thether, and they ſhuld
perceiue and ſée the truth, and more at large, touching
thoſe thinges they then gaue information of: The Generall
hearing this, entered into counſell with the other Captaines,
debating the matter thereof, and argued whether
it were good to enter the Harbour, and ſée if thoſe things
were of truth, which thoſe Moores had imparted to them,
and alſo there to take ſome Pilottes to carrye them
further, ſince they were nowe deſtitute of ſuch:
Vppon which conſultation, it was there determined,

that Nicholas Coello ſhuld firſt make an aſſay & proofe for
enterance and ſounding of the barre, by reaſon his ſhip was
the leaſt of the Fléete: which accordingly he forthwith did.
And ſo going to enter he went and touched the point of the
Iland, and therewith brake his helme, howbeit through
God his goodneſſe, he periſhed not there although he was
in great daunger and haſard thereof, for as he went vpon
the point vnwares, ſo with quicke ſpéede and good fortune
he gote of the ſame: Neuertheleſſe he perceiued and found y•
the barre was good to enter, and therfore he came to an anker,
two croſbow ſhot from the towne ſcituated in that Iland,
which is in fiftéene degrées towards y• South, it hath a
very good harbour, and alſo great plentie of the victuals of
that countrie, the houſes of that towne be made of ſtrawe,
and the dwellers therein are Moores, which trade to Sofala
in great ſhips,Cayro is the caske orrind of a nut they haue in y• India called Caco, and vvith the ſame theſe ropes are made that haue no decks nor nailes, but are ſowed
with Cayro, and their ſailes are of mats made of the leafe
of a palme trée: ſome of them doe carrie with them compaſſes
of Geane by which they doe gouerne, & they be ſquare,
they haue alſo Seacards: with theſe Moores, the Moores of
Indias haue traficke, and with thoſe from the red ſea, by
reaſon of the golde they haue there.
               When they ſawe our men, they ſuppoſed them to bée
Turks, by reaſon of the knowledge they had of the Turks
countrie, through intelligence of the Moores which dwel in
the red ſea, they which were firſt in our ſhips went & tolde
their Xeque (for ſo they call him alwaies that is gouernour
of the towne) which was there for the king of Quiloa, vnder
whoſe obeiſance this Iland was.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine Generall entered into the harbour
of Monſambicke, and how the gouernour there, came
to viſit him at his ſhips, making peace with him, and
gaue him two Pilottes to carry him to Calicut, verely
ſuppoſing our people to be Turkes.
Chap. 6.
               
                  
                  THe Xeque or Gouernor hauing knowledge
of our comming, and that Nicholas Coello
was come to an Anker in the Harbour, he
verelye beléeued that they were Turkes
or Moores of ſome other place, and therfore
foorthwith he came and viſited him in his
ſhips, accompanied with many apparelled in ſilke, whome
Nicholas Coello receiued with great courteſie: but foraſmuch
as he nor any of his ſhip could ſpeake their language,
the Gouernour tarried not long, howbeit Coello vnderſtoode
very well, that the Gouernour déemed them to bée
Moores, and therefore he gaue him a red Cappe, whereof hée
made no accompt, he gaue him allſo certaine blacke beades,
which he carried away in his handes, both which were giuen
and taken for token of aſſurance betwéene them: and
when he ſhould depart from our ſhip, he required by ſignes
of Nicholas Coello to haue his boat to carrie him to lande,
who gladly graunted the ſame, and ſent therewith certaine
of our men, which the Gouernour at his returne to lande,
carried with him to his houſe, feaſting and banketting them
with Dates and other things, and ſent by them to Nicholas
Coello: a pot of Dates preſerued, wherewith he feaſted
the Captaine Generall and his brother, after they had entered
the Harbour.
               The Gouernour now perceiuing the reſt of our ſhippes
arriued in the Harbour,Our men taken for Turks, by the Mores of Monſambicke immediately ſent to viſite them, beléeuing
they were Turkes, and preſented them with many
pleaſant & delicate meates, demaunding alſo licenſe to come
and viſite them himſelfe. The Captaine generall retourned
for preſents to him againe, certaine red hats, ſhort gownes,
corrall, baſons of braſſe, little hawkes bells, and many other
things, all which (as the meſſenger reported, that carryed
the ſame) he nothing eſtéemed, aſking for what purpoſe thoſe
things were good, and demaunding why the Captaine ſent
him not Scarlet, as the thing which he chiefly deſired. Notwithſtanding
he came and viſited the Captaine Generall
who hauing knowledge of his comming, commaunded the

ſhips to put out their flagges, and to toll the ſame. Likewiſe
he ordered, that all our ſicke and diſeaſed men, ſhoulde
be hid and not come in ſight, and that to his ſhippe ſhoulde
be ſent from the reſt of the ſhippes, all thoſe that were not
ſicke, whom he cauſed ſecretly to be put in armour, of purpoſe
to be in a readines if the Moores offered anye force, or
ſought to betraye them.The Gouernor cō
                     meth abootd, & the diſcriptiō of his perſon and attire This preperation made, the Gouernour
came accompanied with manie men, all very well
apparelled in ſilke, bringing with them many trumpets of
Iuorie, and alſo other inſtruments, ſtill plaieng vppon the
ſame: he was a man of a good ſtature and leane, he brought
vpon him as it were a ſhirt of linnen cloath, which came
downe to his héeles, and vpon the ſame, the lyke of veluet
of Meca, hauing vpon his head a cappe of ſilke of many colours,
and trimmed with golde, at his girdle, he ware a
ſword and dagger, and vpon his féete ſhooes of ſilke. The
Captaine generall receiued him at the entrance of the ſhip,
carrieng him from thence, in that part of the ſhip, where the
ſame was couered ouer and trimmed in the beſt manner it
might then be, and many of his people with him, the reſt remaining
that came with him in their beates. The Gouernour
thus being receiued into the ſhip, the Generall deſired
him to take no offence in that he ſent to him no Scarlet,
ſince in truth he brought none with him: onely he declared
that he had in his ſhips, but ſuch Merchaundiſe, as he would
giue and beſtow for victualls, when his men ſhould want
the ſame: and that he went in this order, only of intent to
find out & diſcouer the Indias, by commandement of a great
& mightie King whoſe ſeruaunt he was. All which things
the Generall tolde him by the mouth of Fernan Martin,
who was the Interpretour betwéene them: and then commaunded
to giue them ſuch banketting meates, and wine
as were carried in the ſhippe, whereof he did both eate and
drinke verye well, and ſo in lyke manner did the other,
who came with him, all which were likewiſe feaſted.
And as the Gouernour remayned after this, a very friend
to the Generall, ſo alſo did his people make much, and extende

great frindſhip to our men. He aſked of our Generall,
whether they came from the Turkes Countrey,
for that as he had heard ſaye, the people of the ſame are
white as ours were, requeſting alſo to haue a ſight of
their Countrey bowes, and of the bookes of theyr Lawes:
Wherevnto our Generall aunſwered, that hée and his
Companye were not of the Turkes Countrey, but that
they were of a great Kingdome, which confined vppon the
ſame, and as touching theyr bowes and weaponnes, hée
ſhoulde with verye good will ſée them: But as for the
Bookes of theyr Lawes, they had none there with them,
for to carrye the ſame, were to no purpoſe, ſince vppon
the Sea, they néeded not the vſe thereof. Then
were brought before him certaine Croſſebowes, which alſo
in his preſence were bent and ſhot off, whereat hée
greatly meruayled. They alſo produced to ſight and viewe
of him certaine harneſſes or armours, whereat he alſo meruailed
much.
               By occaſion of this méeting and feaſting, the Captaine
Generall had notice and intellygence, that from thence
to Calycut were nine hundred leagues, and that it was
verye néedefull and neceſſarye for him to take a Pilot
of this Countrey, to conduct him and his Companye, by
reaſon they ſhoulde finde manye ſhoells in theyr Courſe
thether: and alſo that along the Coaſt there are manye
Cities: Moreouer hée vnderſtoode then, that Presbiter
Ioan was farre from thence within the Countrey.
               Now ſince it was ſo expedient to haue a Pilot, the Generall
then requeſted to haue two ſuch of the Gouernour,
who graunted and made promiſe of the ſame, vppon condition
that our men ſhoulde well vſe and content them: Of
theſe Pilots ſo promiſed, our men were glad, for that if
one of them ſhoulde happe to dye, the other yet might
remayne and ſerue theyr purpoſe, and for that conſideration,
our Generall required a couple. After this time,
the Gouernour once more came to viſit the General, bringing
with him both the Pilottes he had made promiſe of,

to each of which was giuen thirtie Crownes and a coate,
euery Crowne worth in money, fiue ſhillings, with this
condition, and from that day forward, that when the one of
them would goe to ſhore, the other ſhould remaine in ſhip,
for that our men would alwaies haue one of them on ſhipboord,
whileſt they remained in Harbour.
            
            
               ¶How the Gouernour of Monſambicke, vnderſtanding
that our Fleete was neither of the
Turkes nor yet Moores, would haue taken and
killed them, and how the Captaine generall vnderſtood
thereof: and what further than followed.

                  THeſe méetings and ſpeaches thus had, for
aſſuraunce of friendſhip betwéene them, &
the concourſe of them being ended, and the
Gouernour departed, yet then immediately
after appeared, that thoſe Moores hauing
had ſuch company and long talke with our
men had gathered and come to knowledge that they were
Chriſtians,The Moores withdravv ther good wils knovving that vve vvere Chtiſtians wherevpon all former good will and friendſhip
of the Moores, was now couerted into wrath and furie,
for they practiſed meanes to kill our men, and ſo to take the
ſhips. The Gouernour had thereof conſulted and made prouiſion,
for execution of their miſcheuous enterpriſe, which
had bene likely to haue taken place, and ſorted to a ſorrowfull
hap and euent, had not the Almightie of his diuine goodneſſe,
moued the heart of one of the Moores, which was receiued
for Pilot to diſcouer the ſame to the Captaine generall,
who fearing leaſt thoſe Infidells ſhould ſodainlye indaunger
him and his, for that they were manie in number,
and with him were but a ſmall companye, did therefore determine
to remaine no longer in that harbour. And ſo vpon
the Saterday, being the tenth daye of March, & ſeuen dayes
after his arriuall there, he departed thence, and went with
his ſhips into the Sea, and came to an Ankor harde by an

Ilande in the ſame, which was one league from that of
Monſambicke, and this was done, to purpoſe, that vppon
Sunday, they would heare Maſſe on lande, confe
                     ••
                   themſelues,
and receiue the Sacrament, which ſince 
                     〈◊〉
                   comming
from Lixborne they had not done. After our ſhippes
wer thus at an Anker, the Captain general then perceiuing
the ſame to be in place of aſſurance ſo as the Moores ſhould
not burne them, (whereof before he was greatly afrayde)
which now by their remooue was preuented and put out of
doubt, he then determined to retourne to Monſambicke in
his boate, to demaund the other Pilot that remayned on
lande at their comming thence: and ſo leauing his brother
with the Fléete in order and readineſſe to come and ſuccour
him, if he ſhould ſée him in daunger, he departed towardes
Monſambicke carrieng with him Nicholas Coello in his
boate and the other Pilot Moore. Going in this ſort, they
ſaw how there came bearing right with his boate, ſixe
boates with many armed Moores, hauing long bowes & arrowes,
and alſo ſhieldes and ſpeares, who when they ſawe
our men, beganne then to call vnto them, willing them to
come to the harbour of their Towne. The Pilot Moore
tolde the Generall what they meant by their ſignes and
tokens they made, and gaue him counſell to retourne thether,
for that otherwiſe the Gouernour woulde not delyuer
the other Pilot which remained on the ſhore, at which his
ſpeach, the General was very angry, ſuppoſing he gaue that
counſell, to the ende at their comming néere the ſhore, hée
might eſcape and runne away, and therefore commaunded
him to priſon, and cauſed foorthwith to ſhoote at theyr boats
with their Ordinaunce, which ſhot when Paulo de la Gama
heard, and beléeuing it had bene ſome further matter of
daungers to the General, then the cauſe thereof was indéed,
he immediately came forwarde with the ſhip called Berrio
vnder ſaile, which when the Nigroes perceiued, they fied, &
made away with great haſt, and ſo faſt that the Captaine generall
could not ouertake them, & therfore he returned with
his brother to the other ſhips where they lay at Ankor.

The next day the Generall, with all his men went on land,
heard Maſſe, and receiued the Sacrament very deuoutlye,
being the night before confeſſed: which being done, they
all went aboord their ſhips, and made ſayle the ſame day.
The Generall perceiuing no hope to remaine for recouerie
of the other Pilot, which was on ſhore in Monſambicke,
gaue them commaundement to releaſe him that was in the
ſhip committed to priſon, (as before you haue heard, whome
they carried with thē on their voyage.The other Moore Pilot in reuēge practiſeth treaſō againſt the fleete This Pilot minded
to be reuenged vpon y• Generall, in ſtomacke of his impriſonment,
determined to cary thē to y• Iland Quiloa, which
was peopled all with Moores, and as it ſéemed, meant to informe
the King of that place, that our ſhippes were of the
Chriſtians, of purpoſe thereby to occaſion him to kill and
deſtroy them all: and therefore ſubtillie to ſhaddowe his
wicked intent, he willed and perſwaded the Captaine generall,
not to trouble himſelfe with the want of the other
Pilot, for that he would carrie him to a great Iland, which
was from thence one hundreth leagues, and inhabited as
it were the one halfe by the Moores, and the other by Chriſtians,
which alwaies were at wars the one with the other,
from whence alſo he might furniſh himſelfe with Pilots to
carry him to Calycut: But as the Captaine generall had
good liking of thoſe ſpeaches, ſo yet gaue he no great credite
to the man, neuertheleſſe he did promiſe him great giftes, if
he did carrie him to that Countrey: and ſo went forward
on his voyage with a ſmall winde. The Tueſdaye after,
being within ſight of lande from whence he departed, hée
was incalmed, which did indure Tueſdaye and Wenſdaye,
the next night after with an Eaſterly wind being but ſmal,
he made way, and went into the Sea, and vpon Thurſday
in the morning, founde himſelfe and all the Fléete, foure
leagues backe behinde Monſambicke, & ſo going vntill the
Euening the ſame day, came then to an Anker hard to that
Iland, where the Sunday next following he heard Maſſe.
The winde thus being contrary to his purpoſe of Nauigation,
he therefore remained in that place eight daies to wait

for ſuch gale thereof as would ſerue to put him forward on
his iourney: In which time repaired to our ſhips a white
Moore which was a Miniſter of the Moores of Monſ
                        •
                     mbicke,
                  A vvhite Moore repaireth to our ſhips.
who comming on boord the ſhip of the Generall, declared
that the Gouernour of the ſame Towne greatlye did
repent him of the breach of peace & friendſhip he had made
with him, & that he would gladly renew the ſame againe &
confirme it, & ſo remaine a friend. To whom the Generall
returned aunſwere by that meſſenger to this effect, that he
would make no peace with the Gouernour, neither would
he be his friend, vntill ſuch time as he did ſend to him his
Pilot whom he had hired and payed, with this aunſwere,
the Miniſter departed, and neuer came againe. The Captaine
generall thus ſtaieng ſtill there, and expecting the
winde, there came to him after the Minſter was gone,
a certaine Moore, who brought his Sonne with him being
a boye, and aſked the Generall whether he woulde carrye
them in his ſhips with him to the Citie of Mylynde, which
he ſhould finde in the courſe he ſhoulde kéepe towards Calycut:
Declaring that he would gladly goe with him, and
returne to his Countrey which was néere to Meca, from
whence he came as a Pilot, in a ſhip to Monſambicke, and
therewith aduertiſed the Generall, not to tarry vppon any
aunſwere, from the Gouernour, who he was aſſured would
make no peace with him, for that he was a Chriſtian.
The Captaine was verye gladde of the comming of this
Moore, for by him hée déemed, to gather ſufficient matter
of information and intellygence of the Strayghtes
of the Redde Sea, and alſo of the Townes that lye
and be ſcituated along the Coaſt, by the which he muſt
ſayle to Mylynde, and therefore he commaunded to receyue
the ſame Moore and his Sonne into his Shippe,
and by reaſon it was then ſomewhat late, and that
they had no ſtore of water, the Generall with the
other Captaines determined to enter into the Harbour
of Monſambicke, to take in there ſo much as they
néeded, appointing alſo there ſhoulde be great watch, for

preuention of the Moores, leaſt that they ſhould by anye deuice
ſet on fire the ſhips. Vpon this determination and being
prepared accordingly, they procéeded and entered the harbour
on thurſday, and when the night was come, they launched
out their boates to go with them for water, for the Pilot
of Monſambicke informed the Generall, that it was
within the firme lande, offering to bring him to the ſame.
Wherevpon taking the Pilot with him, he departed about
midnight to goe thether, hauing Nicholas Coello in his cō
                  pany,
and leauing Paulo de la gama in charge of the ſhips.
Being come to the place where the Pilot informed the water
to be, it could not ſo be found, for he no doubt, went
more to make eſcape and runne awaye, then to perfourme
what before he promiſed, but whether that he was amazed
with imagination of eſcape, and ſo could not finde it, or that
of mallice (ſince he could not run away) he would not finde
it, he cauſed them to ſpend that night without attaining the
purpoſe of their repaire thether, wherefore the day light appearing,
and ſéeing they could not finde the water, the Generall
would remaine no longer, hauing but a ſmall company
of men with him ther, and fearing leaſt the Moores wold
ſet vpon him, did therefore determine to goe to his ſhips, of
purpoſe to fetch more men, and ſo if néed were to fight with
his enimies, knowing alſo he ſhould farre better finde the
water by day then by night. So hauing bene at his ſhips,
and there furniſhed his boates with more force of men and
armour, he retourned to ſhore ward againe, carrieng with
him the Pilot of Monſambicke, and hauing alſo Nicholas
Coello in his companye as before to take in water. And
when they drew néere to the ſame, the Pilot ſéeing that hée
by no meane or deuice coulde runne awaye, did then foorthwith
ſhew them the water, which was harde by the ſhore
ſide, where alſo then were in ſight the number of twentie
Moores ſkirmiſhing with their dartes, and ſhowing as
though they were appointed there for the purpoſe and wold
defende the water againſt ſuch as would enterprice to fetch
or take any thereof.

The manner whereof when our Generall ſawe, he cauſed
to be ſhot off, thrée gunnes to force them to auoide & giue
place in that grounde,The Moores runne away at the cracke of the ordinaunce ſo as our men might leape forth of
their boates and land without reſiſtance: The Moores amazed
& afrighted with cracke and ſhot of ye Ordinance, ran
away and hid themſelues in certein buſhes, and ſo our men
quietly landed and tooke in freſh water, and a little before ye
ſunne ſet arriued at their ſhips, where they found the companie
there diſquieted in minde, for that a Nigroe of Iohn
Cambrayes, Pilot to Paulo de la Gama, was that day run
away to the Moores, wherof when the General vnderſtood,
he was very ſad and ſorrowfull for the ſame, ſince he was
a Chriſtian: Vppon the griefe and ſorrow héereof he remained
there Fridaie following: Vpon the Saturday, béeing
the xxiiii daye of March, and the euen of the Annunciation
of our Lady, early in the morning appeared vpon the ſhoore
ſide a Moore right ouer againſt the Fléete, who cried out
with alowde and ſhrill voice, ſaieng, that if our men wold
haue wate, they ſhould nowe come for the ſame thether,
where they ſhould finde ſuch as would inforce them to
returne. The Captaine Generall perceiuing how ſmall account
they made of him, remembring alſo the iniury done
him in not deliuering the Pilot, and therwith hauing freſh
in memorie the loſſe and running away of the Nigoe, his
Pilots ſeruant, did therevpon grow into ſome cholar, and
ſo determined to ſhoote of the ordinaunce of his ſhips, into
the towne of his enimies, thereby to be reuenged vpon the
ſame for the iniuries done him, by the inhabitants thereof,
and this his determination, he imparted to his Captaines,
who hauing liking of the ſame, yéelded therevnto, and immediatly
imbarked themſelues in their boates, arming the
ſame with ſuch men as they had, and ſo comming before
the towne, and againſt the ſame, there were Moores along
the ſhore, which had made a pale of boords ſo thicke, that
our men could not perceiue who was behinde the ſame. And
betwéene that pale or defence and the ſea, vppon the ſhore
there was one hundreth Moores, armed with Targets,

ſhields, darts, bowes, arrows, & ſlings, who ſo ſoone as our boates
came wtin compaſſe or reatch of their ſlings, began to ſend forth of
the ſame ſtones at our men, who immediatly anſwered them again
with ſhot of Ordinance, through meanes whereof they left the waters
ſide, retiring within their impaled defence, which was preſently
after beaten downe with our ordenance, & the enimies running
to their towne, left behinde them two of their companie ſlaine in
that place: the defence thus broken downe, and the ſame all carried
away, the Captaine Generall with his men returned to dinner, in
which time it was ſtraunge to ſee howe the Moores ran awaie by
land from that towne to another, with y• feare they had of our men,
and from thence they went by water to another place, which was
on the other ſide. After dinner our men went with their Captains
to ſee whether they could take any Moores, verely beleeuing that
by taking of ſome, they ſhuld for the ſame haue reſtitution of Cambraies
Nigro that was runne away as you haue heard before: And
moreouer they thought to recouer two Indians which the Pilot
Moore tolde the General were captiues in Monſambicke. In this
iourney onely Paulo de la Gama did take foure Moores in a boate.
And although ther were other boats wherin many Moores were,
yet could not they be taken, for making haſt to the ſhore, & atteining
the ſame, they ran away, leauing their boats as a pray to our men,
who found in ye ſame much linnen cloth made of cotten, & alſo books
of their lawes of Mahoma, which the Generall commanded to bee
ſafely kept: And albeit he went that day along and before the town
in his boate, as other his Captaines did in like manner in theirs,
yet could not they procure anie talke or ſpeach with anye of the
Moores of the towne, and to goe on ſhoare he durſt not, for that he
had but few men in number with him, wherefore for that time hee
departed thence: and the next day retourned to ſhoare to take in
water, which without anye reſiſtaunce was done. Nowe beeing
without all hope to recouer the Nigro and the two Indians, the generall
then determined to depart without them, howbeit before his
departure, he ment to viſit the town of Monſambick, & the dwellers
therein, with ſome ſufficient reuenge, by ſending to the ſame ſuch
meſſengers, as thereby they might deeme him their mortall enimy,
through the offence they had giuen him,the tovvn of Monſā
                     bick battered from the Fleete wherefore vpon the munday
following hee went before the towne of the Moores with his
Ordinaunce, and ſhooting into the ſame, deſtroied it in ſuch ſorte
as the people thereof were inforced to abandon the ſame, and flye
into an Ilande within the country. And ſo vpon the Tewſday being
the xxvii. daie of March, our Fleet wayed Ankor & departed
from the Towne of Monſambicke, & ſo in going forwarde came to
an Ankor hard by two little rocks of Saint George, for ſo they named
it after they came thether, where they remained, for that the

winde was contrarie to their purpoſe: Neuertheleſſe hauing,
after a ſmall winde they departed, howbeit the ſame was ſo ſmall,
and the currents there ſo great that they were caſt backward.
            
            
               Hovv the Captaine Generall after his departure from Monſambicke,
went tovvards the citie of Quiola, hovv hee
loſt himſelfe going to rhe Iland of Mombaſſa, & how the
ſhip called S. Raphael ſtroke vpon the Flats, the vvhich
novv haue the ſame name. Cap. 8.
               
                  THe Captaine Generall following his voiage, and
being very glad, that they had found, that one of
the foure Moores which Paulo de la Gama toke
in the boate was a Pilolt, & could carry them to
Calicut, vpon the Sunday being the firſt daye of
Aprill, came to certeine Ilands which were very
neere to the ſhore, to the firſt whereof they
gaue a name, calling it the Ilande of the Aſotado,
                  The Iland of aſotado & vvhy ſo called
which they ſo named, for that they there did whippe the Pilot
Moore of Monſambicke, by commaundement of the Generall, as
well for that he had told them thoſe Ilands were firme land, as alſo
before that he wold not ſhew the Generall the water at Monſambick
in the night when they fought for the ſame as before is declared: and
therefore now taking him with the lie, as informed of thoſe Ilands, y•
Generall was very angrie with this Pilot, ſuppoſing as it was likly,
that he did carrie them thether, of intent the ſhips ſhould be caſt
away amongſt the ſame: The Moore being cruellye whipped confeſſed
y• indeed he did cary & train them thether of purpoſe they ſhuld
there haue periſhed, and bene caſt vpon the daungers and rockes of
the Ilands: Theſe Ilands were ſo manye and ſo neere together
ſcituated, that they coulde hardlye bee diſcerned one from another,
which when the Generall perceiued, he made into the Seaward, and
vpon the Fridaye which was the fourth daye of Aprill, made his
way to the Northweſt, & before the noone tide of the ſame, had ſight
of a g
                     •
                  eat land, and of two Ilandes neere to the ſame, about which,
were many ſhoe
                     •
                  s: now being come nere to y• ſhore, y• pilots Moores
did recknowledge y• ſame, howbeit they ſaid y• the Iland of the chriſtians
is that of Quiloa, which was behind or a ſterne vs 3. leagues,
wherwith the generall was much grieued, beleeuing y• certeinly they
were Chriſtians as the Pilots had informed him, and that they had
willingly loſt their courſe, for that the ſhippes ſhould not arriue at
that place. The Pilottes ſhaddowing their treaſon made ſhew of a

reaſonable excuſe, ſaieng, that as the winde was greate, ſo
were the currents ſwift, by reaſon whereof the ſhippes had
further made ſaile then they thought for: But the truth was
indéede, that they more ſorrowed their miſſing and paſſing
by the Iland where they informed to be Chriſtians, then
did our Captaine Generall: For they were verely in hope
to haue ben reuenged ther, vpon our men by death of them
all: But GOD beholding the daunger and perill meant towards
them, of his diuine goodneſſe and mercye deliuered
them from the ſame, and that by a great miracle: For if our
men had gone thether, not one of them had eſcaped with
lyfe, ſince the Generall hauing ſuch a beliefe & opinion, that
there were Chriſtians in that Iland (as the Pilot had tolde
him) would no doubt haue gone preſently on land at his arriuall
there, and ſo thereby runne headlong into a place
where he and his people ſhould haue bene put to ſlaughter:
The Generall thus ſorrowing the miſſe of that Iland, for
that he ſuppoſed there to haue found Chriſtians, and the
Pilots Moores in chafe with themſelues for that they had
miſſed their courſe thether for purpoſe afore ſaid, it was then
on each part determined, to goe back and aſſaie to finde the
ſame: neuertheleſſe although they earneſtly bent themſelues
to attaine vnto that deſired Ilande, and ſpent that daye in
trauell to winne their purpoſe therein, yet coulde they not
preuaile thereto: For ſtill the winde was ſo contrarie, and
the currents ſo great, as doe what they could, they failed of
their wills, and were put off from arriuall there, which no
doubte was done by Gods prouidence, and of his méere
fauour and goodneſſe towards our men: as not willing they
ſhould receiue anie daunger, or ſuſteine crueltie, or loſſe of
lyfe, amongeſt thoſe Infidels, and therefore miraculouſly he
preſerued our people from the effect and ſequele of the malice
of thoſe two Pilots of the Moores of Monſambicke,
which had imagined in their mindes, and trauailed to bring
to finall and execution their diuelliſh intent: The Captaine
generall and the other Captaines thus toſſing vp and
downe, to and fro, as well with their ſhips, as alſo in their

mindes, determined to beare towards the Ilande of Mombaſſa,
                  Another deuiſe of the Mores to deſtroy our men vvithall
in which as thoſe two Pilots gaue information, wer
two Townes, peopled and inhabited as well with Moores
as Chriſtians: (which inſtructions theſe Pilots gaue, to the
intent to deceiue our men, and to traine them thether, of
purpoſe there to kill them, for that in déede that Ilande
was altogether and whollye inhabited by Moores, as in
lyke manner all that Coaſte is,) and therefore vnderſtanding
that from thence to Mombaſſa are ſeauentie ſeauen
leagues, they made way to goe thether, and being then
towards Euening, they ſawe a great Ilande ſcituated towards
the North, in which the Moores Pilots ſayde there
were two Townes, one of Chriſtians, and the other of
Moores, as aforeſayd. Thus they ſayd and inuented to the
intent to bring our men in opinion, and make them beléeue
that there were in that Land, and thoſe Coaſts many Chriſtians.
In this ſort our ſhips going vnder ſaile, certayne
dayes, the ſhip called Saint Raphael by fortune one morning
two houres before daye light, came on ground vppon
certaine ſhoells, two leagues from the firme lande, and as
ſhe ſtrake on ground, they within made ſignes to the other
ſhips to take héede and beware, wherevpon they ſhot by the
ſhoells and came to an Ankor, launching out their boats to
giue ſuccour to Paulo de la Gama Captaine in the Raphael,
and perceiuing when they came to the ſame, that the water
did ebbe, the Generall was meruailous glad thereof, for
then he well knew, that at the next floud the ſhip would be
afloate againe, ſo that now he loſt the feare and iealouſie he
had conceiued, vpon the doubt he had that ſhe was loſt.
Thus recomforted with the certaintie they ſaw of y• ſafetie
of the ſhip, they foorthwith layed into the ſea many ankers.
By this time it was daye lyght, and after that it was a
lowe water, ſhe then remained drye vpon the ſhore being a
Sandie ground, which was the cauſe ſhe tooke no harme,
by ſtriking vpon the ſame. Our men placed their Ankers
which were layd foorth right ouer againſt themſelues, and
walked vpon the Sandes whileſt the Ebbe endured.

So ſtaieng for the floud, and beholding and viewing that
Ilande,The ſhoels of S. Raphael. ſo farre as they coulde ſée, they gaue for name to
thoſe Sandes, the Shoells of Saint Raphael, in reſpect of
the name, the ſhippe there ſo hazarded did beare. And
to certayne great Ilandes and Hilles which were within
the firme Land, directly ouer againſt thoſe ſhoells or ſands,
they gaue the name of The Hills and Ilandes of Saint Raphael,
vpon the ſame conſideration.
               The ſhippe thus being drye, our men ſawe two boates,
and Moores of that Country in the ſame comming towards
them, to ſée our ſhippes, bringing manie ſwéete Orenges,
farre better then thoſe of Portingale, and gaue the ſame to
our men, ſaieng alſo to the Generall, that in no wiſe hée
ſhould feare anye damage that coulde enſue to the ſhippe
on grounde, for that when it were full Sea, ſhe woulde
then be on floate agayne, ſo as at will and pleaſure the
ſame might paſſe on the intended voyage thereof, with
which ſpeaches the Generall was very glad not onelye for
the good comfort they gaue him, but alſo in that they came
in ſo good ſeaſon and time opportune, and therefore he gaue
them certayne giftes, which they accepted with manye
thankes, and certayne of them vnderſtanding that our
Fléete intended their Courſe to Mombaſſa, they deſired
the Generall to carry them with him thether, who graunted
their requeſts, permitted them to abide and remayne
with him, the others retourning from our Fléete to
their Countrey. And when it was a full Sea,
the ſhippe before on ground was afloat,
and ſo came off from the Sandes,
wherevpon the Captaine general
returned, and procéeded
on his way,
with all his
Fléete.

after he came thether. Chap. 9.
               
                  THe Generall following this voyage, did
vpon the Saterday béeing the ſeauenth day
of Aprill, about the going downe of the
Sunne the ſame daye come to an Ankor
without the Barre of the Iland of Mombaſſa,
which is harde by the firme lande,
and is verye plentie of victualls, that is to ſaye, Millyo,
Rice, and Cattell, as well great as lyttle, but all well
growne and fat, chiefly their ſhéepe, which be all without
fayles. Alſo they haue manye Hennes: Moreouer, the Ilande
is verye pleaſaunt, hauing many Orchards, wherein
are planted and are growing, great ſtore of hearbes, & many
ſorts of fruites: that is to ſaye, Pomegranets, Figges
of the Indias, Ore
                     •
                  ges both ſwéete and ſower, Lymons,
and Cidrons, and in the ſame are manye excellent good
waters. In this Ilande there is a Citie, bearing the ſelfe
ſame name of the Ilande, being in foure degrées on the
South ſide, it is a verye great Citie, placed and ſcituated
vppon an Hill, which alſo is a Rocke, wherevpon the Sea
doth beate, ſo that it cannot bée vndermined.
               At the entering into the Protes or Heauen there is a
Marke: and at the enteraunce vppon the Barre, there is
planted or builded a lyttle Fort, lowe and néere to the water.
The moſt parte of the houſes in this Citie, are builded
with lyme and ſtone, with the loftes thereof wrought
with fine knottes of Plaiſter of Paris, the ſtréetes therein
are verye fayre. They haue a King of themſelues, and the
dwellers or inhabitaunts of the ſame are Moores, whereof
ſome bée white, and ſome browne of coulour, both
men and women: it appeareth they are good men on horſebacke.

They goe gallantly arayed, eſpecially the women, which go
apparelled in gownes of ſilke, and be decked and garniſhed
with Iewells of golde and precious ſtones. In this Citie is
great trade of all kindes of Marchandize. There is alſo a
good Harbour, where alwayes are manye ſhippes lieng at
Road, and from the firme land commeth thether great plentie
of Honnie, Waxe and Iuorie, the Captaine Generall
thus come to the Barre of this Citie, did not then enter
foorthwith, for that it was almoſt night when he came to
an Ankor. But he commaunded to put foorth the flagges,
and to toll their ſhippes, reioycing and making great mirth,
for that their good fortune, and hope they conceyued, that
in that Ilande there dwelled manye Chriſtians, and that
the next daye they ſhould heare Maſſe on the ſhore. Moreouer
they were greatly comforted, as hauing ſuch confidence,
that in this place they might and woulde cure and
heale all ſuch as were then ſicke amongeſt them, as in
truth were, almoſt all that were there preſent, albeit in
number but fewe, for all the others were dead. Yet ſuch as
remayned and had eſcaped the ſickneſſe and diſeaſes paſt,
and were not dead of the great infirmities and troubles
before in this voyage chaunced vnto them. Being thus at
an Ankor, and the night almoſt approched, our men ſaw about
an hundred men in a great Barcke, euery one of them
hauing a Sworde and a Target, who at their comming to
our ſhippes, woulde haue entered therein with all theyr
weapons: howbeit the Generall would not conſent thereto,
neither permitted he anye more to enter then foure of
them, and thoſe alſo without weapon, declaring to them in
their language that they ſhoulde pardon him ſince he was
a ſtraunger,Certaine of the inhabitants of this city came aboorde the ſhip. and therefore coulde not tell whom he might
truſt, and vnto thoſe whom he gaue licenſe to enter aboorde
his ſhip, he gaue good and gentle entertainment, banketting
the ſame with ſuch Conſerues as they had, (whereof thoſe
Moores did well eate) willing them not to déeme euill of
him, for his denyall of theyr enteraunce in manner aforeſayde,
where-vnto they aunſwered, that theyr

comming then was to ſée him as a rare and new thing in
that their countrie, and that he ſhoulde not meruaile to ſee
them bring theyr weapons, ſince it was the cuſtome & vſe
of the ſame to carrie them as well in peace as in the time of
warre: alſo they further declared vnto the generall, that the
king of Mombaſſa did vnderſtand of his comming, and for
that it was ſo néere night, he had not then ſent to viſit him,
howbeit the next day he would, and that as he was glad of
his arriuall there, ſo alſo would he be more glad to ſee him,
yea, and to giue him ſpices to load his ſhips, furthermore,
they informed him that there were many Chriſtians, which
liued by themſelues in that Iland: wherevpon the General
was not onely ioyfull, but alſo fullye perſwaded that their
report thereof was true and vnfeined, ſince the ſame was
agréeable, and accorded with the information and talke of
the two Pilottes, neuertheleſſe he carried ſome ſparke of
iealouſie in his head and for all their faire ſpeaches and ſugured
talke, he wiſely imagined y• thoſe Moores, came to ſée
whether they might, by anie traine take one of our ſhips,
wherein he geſſed vpon the truth, for certeinly their comming
then was onely for that purpoſe, as afterward it was
made apparant. For moſt true it was y• the king of Mombaſſa
did know and had perfect intelligence that we were
Chriſtians, and alſo what we had done in Monſambicke, &
therefore he practiſed meanes to be reuenged of vs,Svvete practiſes of ſowre treaſon. by taking
our ſhips and killing of vs, wherefore proſecuting his
wicked intent therein, the next daie following, which was
Palme ſundaie, he ſent to our Generall certeine white
Moores, which declared to him y• their king was very glad
of his comming thether, and that if he wold come into his
harbour, he would liberally giue him all things he ſtoode in
néede off, and for aſſurance of the ſame he ſent him a ring,
a ſhéepe, and many ſwéete Orenges, Cidrons, and Sugar
canes, giuing alſo theſe Moores inſtructions to tell him further,
that they were Chriſtians, and that in the Iland were
many chriſtened people: All which they did in ſuch ſorte
counterfai
                     •
                  e, and with ſo great and déepe diſſimulation, that

our men thought verely they were Chriſtians: wherefore
the Generall receiued them very well, and gaue them certeine
giftes, ſending to the King greate thankes for his
gentle and liberall offer, ſaieng further, that the next day
he woulde come néerer in: Hée ſent alſo to the King a
braunch of Corall verye fine, and for more aſſuraunce
to confirme the ſame, he ſent with thoſe Moores two of
our men, which were baniſhed perſons, and were carried
of purpoſe to bée aduentured in ſuch like reſpect of
daunger, or to be lefte and putte on ſhore in ſuch places,
where it ſhoulde be thought good to vnderſtande ſomewhat,
and then to returne and be taken in againe, when
our men and the two Moores were gone: and come to the
ſhore, there met them a multitude of people to ſée them, all
which went with them and viewed them, euen to the kings
Pallace, where our men béeing entered, they paſſed through
thrée doores before they came where the king was, at each
of which there was a Porter attending, hauing euerye
one of them a ſwoorde in his hand. They found the King
but in ſmall eſtate, neuertheleſſe hée receiued them verye
well, and commaunded that in the ſelfe ſame companie of
the Moores with whome they came, they ſhould be ſhewed
the Citie, and carried about the ſame in going and viewing
whereof, they ſawe in the ſtréetes many men Priſoners
& in yrons, but becauſe our men vnderſtoode not their
language, nor they had any vnderſtanding of ours, there
was no queſtion demaunded by our two meſſengers, what
Priſoners thoſe were, howbeit they beléeued the ſame to
bée Chriſtians, for that our Generall was informed by the
two Pilottes, and the Kinges meſſengers, (as you haue
before hearde) that there were in that Ilande ſuch Chriſtians,
which alſo had warres with the Moores.
               Moreouer they carryed our men to the Merchauntes
houſe of the Indias,
                  Merch̄ts of the Indias vvhich are Chriſtians which were Chriſtians, who hauing
information that ours alſo were people Chriſtened, ſhewed
themſelues to be ioyfull thereof, both imbracing and
banketting them, ſhewing them painted in a Paper, the figure

of the holy Ghoſt, the which they did worſhippe, and
before them made their Prayers vppon theyr knées, and
that with ſuch a counteuaunce, and ſhew of greate deuotion,
as though they were ſuch men inwardlye indéede, as
in appearaunce outwardlye they then pretented, and made
ſhewe off: Furthermore, the Moores then tolde our men
by ſignes, that manye other Chriſtians as thoſe were, did
dwell in another place farre from thence, and therefore
they would not carrie them thether: howbeit they ſayde,
that after our Captaine Generall were come into the
Porte or Harbour, they ſhoulde goe and ſée them.
All theſe thinges thoſe wilie people, ſhewed and imparted
to our men, of purpoſe to deceiue them and to allure them
to come within that Porte, where they were determined
to deſtroy and kill them all.
               After they had ſéene the Citie, they were then brought
to the preſence of the King, who commaunded to ſhew them
Pepper, Ginger, Cloaues, and Wheate, giuing them of
euerye ſorte thereof ſome portion to be carryed and ſhewed
the Generall, and ſent him worde by his meſſenger,
that of all thoſe commodities he hadde greate ſtore, and
woulde giue him his loading if that hée woulde. Alſo that
he had Golde, and Siluer, Amber, Waxe, Iuorye, and
other riches, in ſo greate plentie, that hée ſhoulde haue
and finde there when hée woulde for leſſe valour and priſes,
then in anie other place.
               This Meſſage was brought to our Captaine Generall
vppon Mundaye, who hauing ſéene the Spices, and
hearing of the Kinges promiſe, to furniſhe him the ſame,
and to lade him therewith, was meruailous gladde of
that offer, and ſo much the rather, was hée confirmed in
opinion of good lucke, for that our two baniſhed men,
hadde gathered ſuch intelligence, and made him ſo full
and good declaration of the People, Citie, and Lande
there, and chiefelye of the two Chriſtians, they
founde in the Houſe of the Merchauntes of the Indias.
               
               
                  
Wherefore he & his Captaines immediatly aduiſed themſelues
thereof, and ſo entering into counſel for the ſame, it
was by them thought good, to come within the port, and to
accept the offer of Spices, and afterwarde to goe on theyr
voiage to Calicut, where if they could not haue the like,
they would remaine content, with that they ſhould haue in
this place, and thus hauing concluded vppon theſe pointes,
they determined to enter into the harbour the next daie: in
this meane while came certeine Moores to our ſhips with
ſo great quietneſſe, and humilitie, and with ſuch ſhew and
appearance of friendlineſſe and loue, as though they had ben
of long acquaintance and familiaritie with our men: The
next day following in the morning, y• floud being come, the
Generall commanded to take vp their Ankors, minding to
enter the harbour, but God not willing that he and the reſt
ſhould enter into that preſent miſchiefe,God ſent them fatherly checks to keepe thē frō vtter deſtructiō
                   nor to ende theyr
liues in that place (as the Moores had determined they ſhuld
haue done,) did therefore cauſe and prouide the meane that
preuented that perill, and wrought their ſafetie: For when
the Generalls ſhip had wayed her Ankor, and was going
to enter the port, ſhe ſtrake vpon a ſhoel that was aſterne
the ſame, which hap when he perceiued, and fearing hée
ſhould caſt himſelfe away, he then forthwith commanded,
to let fall his Ankor, & in like ſort did the other Captaines
alſo: which chance when the Moores that were in the ſhips
ſawe, & that the Generall was come to an ankor, they then
imagined that during that daye, they ſhoulde not gette the
Fléete into the harbour, and therefore they ran to theyr
boate, which they had on the ſhips ſide to goe to the Citie,
at which inſtant alſo the Pilots of Monſambicke, falling
a ſtearne the Admirall, tooke the water, and thoſe of the
boate tooke them in and carried them away with them, although
the Generall called vnto them, requiring them to
bring backe, and deliuer them to him againe: But when he
ſawe they would not ſo doe, then he apparantlye perceiued
that ther was an euill meaning in their King and them, towards
him and his, and that it was his great goodneſſe and

fauour to giue him cauſe of ſtaye, by happening vppon that
ſhoell, thereby to preſerue him from their treaſon imagined,
and put in practiſe: Thus hauing declared to all his
company, the opinion he conceiued of that which then before
their eyes was done, and appeared to be deuiſed and
wrought againſt them, he then commaunded the night beeing
come, to giue ſome torments or torture, to two of the
Moores, which he brought captiues with them from Monſambicke,
thereby to ſée whether they had practiſed any treſon,
and to inforce them to open and diſcloſe the ſame:
which commaundement being obſerued, and put in execution,
by heating and dropping of bacon vppon their fleſh,
they immediately confeſſed, they had conſpired treaſon, and
that the Pilots tooke the Sea, as fearing the ſame had ben
diſcloſed: wherevpon the Generall, altogether altered his
minde and purpoſe of going into that Harbour. Neuertheleſſe
being vnquiet and greatly gréeued at their falſhood, he
was deſirous to vſe lyke torture to another Moore captiue
alſo: to make tryall whether he were of counſell and in
conſort with the reſt.
               But this Moore perceiuing preparation made for that
purpoſe, did caſt himſelfe his hands being bound, into the
ſea, as in lyke manner another of them did, before it was
daye light. The ſecrecie of the miſchiefe prepared, being
thus come to apparaunt view, and ſo diſcouered, the Generall
gaue great thankes to God, by whoſe only goodneſſe, he
and his company were delyuered from imminent death and
ſlaughter amongſt thoſe Infidells, and therefore in contemplation
and thankes giuing for the ſame, he and his company
béeing aboord the Admirall, ſayd the Salue Regina.
After this being mindfull of their ſafetie, and fearing leaſt
the Moores would attempt ſome matter againſt them in the
night time, they therefore ordained ſtrong and diligent
watch, commaunding euerye man to watch armed: And
héere by the way is to be noted one thing, and that to bee
meruayled at, which is this: That when our men came
firſt before the Towne of Mombaſſa, all ſuch amongeſt

them as then were ſicke, (which indéede were many) began
then preſently to be whole: ſo that in this time of theyr
great neceſſitie, and daunger, they felt and found themſelues
ſound and ſtrong, which as it was paſt all hope and expectation
of man, and farre aboue the common courſe of Nature,
and operation of the ſame, ſo the more liuely it appeared
to be the meruailous and ſupernaturall worke of God,
and therefore miraculouſly done at this inſtant time of neceſſitie,
when his diuine power was to be ſéene and extended,
for the preſeruation of that poore diſtreſſed number,
which then had their onely affiaunce in him. The watch
thus prepared and ſet for that night, it fortuned that thoſe
which watched in the ſhippe Berrio, felt the gabell of the
ſame wagging, whereat an Ankor lay into the Sea, and at
the firſt they adiudged that the gabell had bene wagged or
ſhaken by a kinde of Fiſh called a Tunnie whereof many
were there about which be very great and good meate,Tunnie good meate & plentifull in the coaſt of Mōbaſſa.
but giuing better and more attentiue eare thereto, they then
perceiued that their enimies were at the ſame, who in truth
did ſwimme about the gabell, and were cutting of it with
their woodkniues or fawchings, and hoping or rather verely
knowing, that perfourming their enterpriſe thereof the
ſhippe would runne a ſhore, and ſo both ſhe and our men in
the ſame be caſt away and taken: For by any other deuiſe
they coulde not accompliſh their willes, and therefore they
practiſed this meane. Howbeit our men hauing diſcryed
whereabout they were, preuented them, by crieng out and
calling to the other ſhippes, ſhowing what was in dooing,
and willing them alſo to beware and looke to the ſame,
wherevpon they of the ſhippe Raphael, came preſentlye to
their ſuccour and reſcew, finding ſome of their enimies amongſt
the cheines of the tacklings of their formaſt, who
perceiuing how they were diſcouered, ſodainly caſt themſelues
vnder water, and with the others that were cutting
the gabell of the ſhippe Berrio, fledde away ſwimming to
certaine boates, which they had lyeng ſomewhat farre off,
wherein (as our men afterward vnderſtoode) were many

Moores, who taking them in, rowed faſt awaye, and ſo retourned
to the Citie. The Wenſday and Thurſday following,
our Fléete ſtill remained there, about which in y• night
time came the enimies in boates, which alwayes lay harde
by the ſhore, from which ſome of them did ſwimme of purpoſe
to eſpie, if by any meane they could cut a ſunder the
gabells of the Ankors, but our men obſerued and kept ſuch
diligent and warie watch, that they could not preuaile, neuertheleſſe
our men were greatlye troubled, and put in
feare of burning their ſhippes. For truly it was to be meruayled
at, that the Moores came not about the ſame in ſuch
ſhippes as they had, which if they had done, it had bene
then lykely by all coniecture of man, that they ſhould haue
deſtroyed and killed vs all. It was coniectured that they
béeing in feare of the Ordinaunce in our ſhippes, durſt
not giue attempt to ſet vppon the ſame by force, but whatſouer
cauſe appeared in our ſightes to bée a lette in that
reſpect to them: It was moſt certayne in déede, that it
was God his good will and fauour, to put their hearts
in feare to deale with vs in anye forceable manner,
whereby we might be preſerued from the crueltie intended
towardes vs.
            
            
               ¶Heerein is contayned matter of the Citie of
Mylinde, and how the Captaine generall came
thether. Chap. 10.
               
                  THe Captaine generall did willingly tarrie
& remaine before Mombaſſa, the two daies
as before is declared, of purpoſe to ſée if he
could haue from thence two Pilots to cary
him to Calicut, for that without them it
was verye hard for him to goe thether,

ſince our Pilots had no knowledge of that Countrey. But
when he ſawe he coulde not haue anye there, he departed
thence vpon Friday in the morning with a ſmall winde,
and at the comming ouer the Barre, he lefte behinde him
one of his Ankors, for his men were ſo wearied with bringing
and hailing vp the reſt, that they coulde not waye vp
the ſame, which afterward being found ther by the Mores,
was carried to the Citie, and placed harde by the Kings
Pallaice, and remained there at what time Don Franco
de Almeyda was the firſt Lord Preſident of the Indias:
who when he tooke the ſame towne from the Moores, found
this Ankor there, as I ſhall declare in the ſecond Booke of
this preſent Treatiſe. Being thus departed from Mom. baſſa
and paſſing on their voyage, eight leagues beyonde the
ſame, the Generall and his Fléete, through lacke of winde,
came to an Ankor hard by the land in the night, and in the
dawning of the daye, they diſcouered two Sambucos (which
are little Pinnacies) vnder the lye, thrée leagues from the
Fléete a Sea boord, which when the Generall ſawe, and
being deſirous to haue ſome Pilots to carrie him to Calycut,
he ſuppoſed he might be ſped of ſuch to ſerue his turne,
if he could take thoſe ſmall boates or Pinnacies, and therfore
waying his Ankors, he and the other Captaines went
towards them, and purſued the ſame vntil Euenſong time,
at which inſtant the Generall tooke one of them, but the
other ranne alande, from whence before it came. In this
Pinnace which was ſo taken, were ſeauentéene Moores,
amongſt which was one olde Moore, who ſéemed to be Maſter
of the reſt, hauing with him a young woman that
was his wife:Among the Mores alſo olde men vſe to marrie yoūg vvomen. In the ſame alſo was found great ſtore of
ſiluer and golde, and ſome victualles. The Captaine not
ſtayeng vppon this occaſion, foorthwith went forwarde,
and in the ſelfe ſame daye with his whole Fléete came
harde by Mylynde, which is eightéene leagues from Mombaſſa,
and in thrée degrées to the Southwarde it hath no
good Harbour, for that it is almoſt an open Roade, but
there is a certain Piere or recife wheron the ſea doth beat,

which is the cauſe why the ſhips doe ride far from y• ſhore:
This Citie ſtandeth in a broad field along the Sea ſide, &
round about the ſame are many Palme trées, with many
other ſorts of trées, which all the yeare grow gréene: Alſo
many Gardens and Orchards,The beautiful ſcituation of Mylynde, vvith the pleaſantnes of the ſoile, and fruits. repleniſhed with all kind of
hearbes and fruits, and very faire fountaines of good waters
in the ſame: But principally their Orenges excel, which
are not onely very great, but alſo very ſweet and pleaſant
in taſt: They haue alſo great ſtore and plentie of victuals,
as Mylyo and Ryſe, Cattell both greate and ſmall, alſo
great ſtore of Hennes, which bee very fat and good cheape.
The Citie is great, hauing in the ſame faire ſtréets, & many
faire houſes of lime and ſtone, builded with many lofts,
with their windowes and tarriſis made of Lime & earth:
The naturall people of that Countrie are blacke, and of
good proportion of bodie, with curled haire, the ſtraungers
which reſort thether & make their abode there, are Moores
of Arabia which doe gouerne themſelues very well & commendably,
eſpecially the Gentlemen, who from the girdle
vpward goe naked, and from the ſame downeward doe couer
themſelues with ſilke, and with very fine cotten cloth,
and others with ſhort Cloakes made of Cotten after the
olde faſhion, the which they doe weare to couer their arms
pits: and vpon their heads, they weare a certeine manner
of Cloth wrought with ſilke and golde. They weare alſo
rich Daggers with great taſſels of ſilke, of many colours,
and ſwoords very well garniſhed: They be all left handed,
and carrie with them alwaies bows and arrowes, for they
vſe the paſtime of ſhooting, & be great good Archers. Moreouer,
they account themſelues to be good horſemen, although
there be a common ſaieng or ſpeach vſed by the inhabitants
in the coaſts thereaboutes: The men on horſebacke of
Mombaſſa: and the women of Mylynde: for as in Mombaſſa
be very good horſemen, ſo in Mylynde are very faire
women, which goe richly apparelled: In this Citie alſo
dwel many Gentiles of the kingdome of Cambaya, which
is in the Indias: and thoſe are greate merchants vſing tract

or traficke for golde, whereof there is ſome in that Countrie,
as in like manner ther is Amber greace, Iuory, Pitch,
and Waxe, all which they giue in exchaunge to ſuch as
come from Cambaya for Copper, Quickſiluer, and Cloth
of Cotten, and that the one and the other hath gaines therof:
The king of this Citie is a Moore, and is ſerued with
farre greater eſtate then the other kings which remaine
behinde▪
                  Mylynde like a city of Portingale The Generall being come ouer againſt this Citie
did reioyce in his heart very much, and ſo likewiſe did all
the reſt of the Fléete, for that they now ſawe, a Citie lyke
vnto thoſe of Portingale, and therefore they rendered moſt
heartie and humble thankes to God, for their good and ſafe
arriuall there: And being deſirous to haue ſome Pilottes
to carrie them to Calicut, the Generall commaunded to
come to an Ankor, minding to aſſay if he coulde by anye
meanes obteine ſuch there as might ſerue for that purpoſe:
For vntill this time, he could not know of the Moores hée
had taken, whether amongeſt them were any Pilots, who
albeit they were offered torments, ſtill anſwered and ſaid,
there were none of them ſkilfull in that reſpect.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine Generall ſent a Moore in meſſage
to Mylynde, and what aunſwere the King made
him. Cap. 11.
               
                  THE next day after being Eaſter euen, the
old Moore which was taken Captiue, with
the reſt in the Pinnace, tolde the Generall
that in Mylynde were foure ſhips of the
Chriſtian Indias, promiſing alſo that if he
would licenſe him, and the other Moores
to goe to land, he would giue him for his reſgat, Chriſtian
Pilots, and moreouer wold furniſh him with all things
he had néede off. The Generall being well pleaſed with the
ſpeaches, and offer of this olde Moore, commaunded to wey
theyr Ankors, and ſo remoued and came to an Ankor within

in halfe a league of the Citie. But from thence there came
no bodie to our Fléete, for they feared and were in doubt
that our men would take them captiue, and beſides they
knew by the Pinnace which the Generall tooke, that wee
were Chriſtians, beléeuing alſo that our Shippes were
Shippes of warre: All which the Generall ſuppoſing they
coniectured: hée therefore vppon the Mundaye in the morning
commaunded the olde Moore to a certeine ſhelfe lyeng
ouer againſt the Citie, and there to leaue him, from
whence he déemed they woulde fetch him, as indéede they
did, for when our Boate was gone from thence, there
came from the ſhoare a boat for the Moore, & ſo caried him
awaye preſently to the King, to whome the Moore declared
on the behalfe of the Generall what hée requeſted to
haue, and further that hée deſired to be at peace with
him, in reſpect of his noble perſonage, whereof hée had heard
greate good reporte, hoping alſo that it was God his great
good will & pleaſure that the Indias ſhould bée diſcouered,
which the rather by his aide & furtherance might be accompliſhed.
The king hearing and receiuing in fauourable part
the meſſage, and meſſenger, was alſo verie gladde thereof,
and forthwith retourned the Moore in a Boate, ſending
with him one of his owne ſeruauntes, and a Prieſt by
whome hée ſent the Captaine Generall worde, that he was
verye willing to conclude a peace betwéene them, and that
hée woulde giue him ſuch Pilottes,A preſent ſent to ye Captaine Generall from the king of Mylynde as he woulde deſire,
with whatſoeuer beſides he had néede of, and by theſe meſſengers
were preſented to the Generall, from the King
thrée Shéepe, many Orenges, and Sugar Canes, which he
receiued in thankfull wiſe, & by the ſelfe ſame meſſenger, returned
anſwere to the king their Maiſter, that he graunted
vnto, and accepted of the peace moued and offered betwéene
them, and was and woulde be readie to confirme the ſame.
Moreouer hée ſaide vnto them, that the next daye, hée would
enter into their Harbour, and that the King ſhoulde
vnderſtande that hee came from, and is ſubiecte to a
greate King, vppon the Cape of the Occident, who

was deſirous to know where the Citie of Calicut ſtoode, &
had ſent him to finde out and diſcouer the ſame, commaunding
him alſo, to make peace with all kings and Princes,
vpon whoſe territories in his waie, he ſhould hap to come
and arriue, which would be willing to haue the ſame with
him: and further tolde them that it was now two yeares
ſince he came from his Countrie, and that the king his
Maiſter was ſuch a worthy and puiſſaunt Prince, as the
king their Maiſter would be gladde to knowe him for his
friend: Thus hauing talked and diſcourſed with them to
effect aforeſaid, hée then diſmiſſing them, ſending by the
ſame for a Preſent a Hat, (which in that time was vſed)
and two braunches of Corall, thrée baſons of Braſſe, certeine
little Bells, and two Scarffes to the king. The next
daie after, being the ſecond after Eaſter daie, the Captaine
Generall came néere to the Citie, whereof the king hauing
knowledge, did immediatly ſend to viſite him, in more honourable
ſorte: for hearing how farre of he was come, and
what he ſought, he adiudged the king of Portingale to bée
a Prince of a great ſtomack, and the General to be a worthy
ſubiect in obeyeng to hazard himſelfe, in ſo daungerous
and long a iourney Alſo hée conceiued greate pleaſure
in his heart that he ſhoulde ſée ſuch people, as had ſo long
time trauailed vpon the ſea, and ſo deſirous to ſée our men,
he ſent word to the Generall, that the next day following,
he would in his own perſon viſite him, and that their méeting
ſhould be vpon the water, and therewith ſent him ſixe
ſhéepe, and ſtore of Cloues, Ginger, Pepper, and Nutmegs.
This meſſage thus declared, the Captaine Generall yéelded
to the kings determination, and therevpon did enter
néerer, and came to an Ankor, harde to the foure ſhippes of
the Indias, (whereof the olde Moore tolde him before.) The
Owners then hauing knowledge that our ſhippes came
from a Chriſtian Countrie, and that we were Chriſtians,
did immediatly come to viſite our Generall, who at that
inſtant was in the ſhip of Paulo de la Gama: Theſe men
are browne of coulour, but they are of good ſtature & well

proportioned:The deſcriptiō of their perſons and attire that inhabite this coū
                     trey and Citie. They goe apparelled in long white gownes
made of cotten, they haue great beards, & the hayre of their
heades is long lyke vnto womens, and pleited vnder theyr
toockes, which they weare on theyr heades. The Generall
at theyr repaire to him, receiued them verye well, aſking
them firſt whether they were Chriſtians, by an Interpretour
he had that could ſpeake the Algarauia tongue, wherof
they had ſome vnderſtanding, ſaieng that it was not
their proper language, howbeit they yet had ſome knowledge
therof, by occaſion of the trade and talke they vſually
haue with ye Moores, of whom they aduiſed him to beware,
and not haue ouer farre truſt and confidence in thoſe
of Mylynde, leaſt that the ſequell of their inwarde meaning,
were farre contrarie to their outwarde ſhewe. The
Generall determining of himſelfe to make tryall, whether
they were Chriſtians or not, or had anye knowledge of
God, commaunded to bring forth a Table, wherein was
painted the picture of our Ladie at what time ſhe wept, in
which alſo were the pictures of ſome of the Apoſtles, and
ſhewed the ſame to the Indians, not telling them what it
was: which they ſawe, they fell preſently downe
vpon the ground, worſhipping that Repreſentation, and
prayed a while, whereof our Generall was verye ioyfull,
and then demaunded whether they were of the Citie of
Calycut, wherevnto they aunſwered, No: howbeit they
ſayd they were of another Citie, further off called Grangalor,
but of Calicut they could not ſay or informe any thing.
And from this time, ſo long as our Fléete remayned
there, they dayly came to the ſhippe of Paulo de la gama,
to make their prayers before that Table, and did
offer to the Images in the ſame, Pepper, and
other things. Theſe Indians did eate
no Béefe, as we were informed of
them.
            
            
               
               ¶How the King of Mylynde viſited the Captaine
generall, and made peace with him, giuing him a
Pilot to carry him to Calycut. Cap. 12.
               
                  THe laſt day of the eight after Eaſter, dinner
being done, the King of Mylynde came in
a great boate hard to our Fléete, apparelled
in a Caſſocke of Crimſon Damaſke, lined
with gréene ſatten, hauing vpon his head a
rich towell. He was ſitting in a chaire, ſuch
as was vſed in olde time, very well made and wrought
with wire, being in ſight very faire, and in the ſame was
a cuſhion of ſilke, and another like vnto that hard by him,
which was couered with a hat of Crimſon ſatten. There
ſtood hard by him as his Page, an olde man, who carried a
very rich ſword, the ſcabered wherof was ſiluer: he brought
with him manye Shagbuts, and two Flutes of Iuorie,
which were eight ſpans of length each of them, they were
very well wrought, and vppon the ſame they played by a
little hole that is in the midſt thereof, agréeing and according
well with the ſhagbuts. There came with the King,
about the number of twentie Moores Gentlemen all richly
apparelled. The King now being come néere to the ſhips,
the Captaine generall came forth to méete him in his boat
well trimmed and ſet out with all his flagges, and he himſelfe
comely araied, withall his beſt apparell, carrieng with
him twelue of the moſt principall men of his ſhippes, his
brother onely except, whom he left with charge of ye ſame.
The boates of each part being come néere together,The meeting of the king of Mylind and the Captaine generall. and the
one making countenance of friendly ſalutation & entertainment
to the other, the King then ſaid to the Generall, that
he would ſpeake with him in his owne boat, of purpoſe to
ſée & view him the better, whervpon foorthwith he receiued
him into his boat, the King then giuing to the Generall as
great honour & curteſie as though he had alſo ben a King:
he very earneſtly noted & beheld him & his men, as a ſtrange
ſight and matter to him and his people: he required the Generall
to tell him the name of his King, and being tolde, he

commaunded the ſame to be then preſently written: he alſo
inquired matter perticularly of him, & of his power, whervnto
the Generall aunſwered, and in euerye point ſatiſfied
his demaund, declaring alſo for what cauſe ye king his maſter
had ſent him to diſcouer Calicut, which was to haue
from thence ſpices, whereof in his dominion & countrey was
none. And after he had thus talked with the King & informed
him ſomewhat of the ſame & of the ſtraights of ye red
Sea, the King then promiſed to him a Pilot to carry him to
Calicut, & alſo very earneſtly deſired him to goe with him
into his Citie, there to take his pleaſure, & ſolace himſelf in
his Pallaice, ſaieng it was néedfull & neceſſary, after ſo many
troubles, in ſo long a voyage ſuſtained, to vſe ſome recreation,
and take ſome reſt: further then promiſing, that if
he would ſo do, that afterward he in like manner would go
with him to ſée his ſhips, & make merry in the ſame, whervnto
the Generall aunſwered, that he had no licenſe of the
King his Maſter to go a ſhore, & therefore if he ſhuld varie
from his Princes wil & commaundement therein, he ſhuld
then giue an euill accompt of himſelfe, to which excuſe the
King replied, ſaieng, that if he ſhuld go to ſée his ſhips, what
accompt ſhould he then make to thoſe of his Citie, or what
might they déeme & adiudge of him therein: yet notwithſtanding
he ſaid, yt it was a griefe to him yt he refuſed to go
with him to his Citie, which was & ſhuld be at ye commandemēt
of him & of ye king his maſter, to whom he wold ſend
his Embaſſador or els write, if he wold come yt way at his
returne from Calicut. The General yéelding thanks to the
King, promiſed him to returne y• way, & whileſt they were
thus talking there, did ſend for thoſe Moores, which he had
taken captiues, and gaue them to the King, ſaieng that if
he could do him any further pleaſure, he would gladly doe
the ſame: with which gift the King was ſo content, that he
ſaid, he did more eſtéeme of the ſame, then if he had giuen
him ſuch another Citie as that of Mylynde was.
Now hauing ended their talke and confirmed the friendſhip
betwéene them, the King then rowing amongſt our ſhips,

and behelde the ſame, with great pleaſure and admiration▪
out of which great ſtore of ſhot of Ordinaunce paſſed,
wherewith they were greatlye delyghted, all which time
our Generall went with him, to whom he declared, that he
neuer ſaw any men of whom he tooke ſo great pleaſure, as
he did of thoſe of Portingall, whereof he woulde gladye
haue ſome with him, to helpe him in his warres, which
he hath ſometime with his enimies: for it well appeared
they were men apt to offend their enimie, and to abide and
ſuffer any trauell or paine, that ſhould happen vnto them.
To which his ſpeaches the Generall aunſwered, that if hée
had experience of their doings, he woulde then a great
deale better lyke of them, and further that they would helpe
him, if the King his Maſter would ſende his ſhips of warre
to Calicut, as he doubted not but he would, if it wer Gods
good pleaſure to permit the ſame to be diſcouered. After the
King had in this ſort ſolaced himſelf, he then deſired the
General, that ſince he would not go with him to his Citie,
he ſhuld then let him haue two of his men to go and ſée his
Pallaice, and for pledge of the ſame, he would giue him his
ſonne, and one of his chiefe Chaplaines, the which they call
Cacis, wherevnto the Generall yéelded and appointed two of
our men to go with the King, who at his departure, requeſted
the Generall that the next day he would goe along in
his boate hard by the ſhore, where he ſhuld ſée his horſmen
running, & ſo they departed for that time, the next day being
Thurſday, the Captaine generall & Nicholas Coello, went
in their boates armed along the ſhore, the one ſomewhat diſtant
from the other, betwéene whom vpon the ſhore were
many men on horſebacke ſkirmiſhing, & as our boats approched
néere the ſhore, there came certaine footemen downe
certaine ſtayres of ſtone from the Kings houſe, which was
in ſight, where they tooke the King vp in a chaire, and caried
him verye néere to the Boate of the Generall, to
whom he ſpake verye louing wordes, and once more requeſted
him to enter vpon land, and go to his Citie, for that
his father being a lame man, was deſirous to ſée him, and

that whileſt he ſhould remaine on ſhoare,The Generall vvould not conſent to go on lād at Mylynde both he and his
children would enter and abide in his ſhips. But our Generall,
fearing leaſt vnder ſuch ſugred ſpeach ſome bitter
baite might lie couered, did therfore ſtill excuſe himſelf for
going on land, alleadging hée muſt obey his Prince, who
gaue him no licenſe or commiſſion ſo to do at anie time.
And ſo taking his leaue of the king, hée went a while hard
by the ſhips of the Indias, ſhooting off much Ordinaunce,
who when they ſawe vs paſſe by lifted vp their hands, ſaieng:
Chriſte, Chriſte, and that night with the kings licenſe
our men made them a great feaſt, with much paſtime alſo
of Squibs, Gunne ſhot, and great and lowde cryes. The
Fléet thus lyeng in ye harbour, there came vpon ye ſundaie
béeing the. 21. day of Aprill, from the king, a man that was
in great credit with him, to viſite the Captaine Generall,
who at that inſtant was very ſad and heauie: for that it
was then two daies ſince any man came to the Fléet from
the Citie, by reaſon whereof he feared leaſt that the king
were offended with him, as taking occaſion of offence, for
that he refuſed to go on ſhoare, ſuppoſing alſo that he wold
therevppon, breake the peace and league made betwéene
them, for which he was ſorrowfull, eſpecially ſince as yet
he had no Pilots. And when he ſawe, that he which was
ſo great with the king, did bring him no Pilots, he then
began to haue ſome iealouſie, and ſuſpition of the king, who
being informed therof, and knowing the Generall remained
there for that cauſe, did therefore forthwith ſend him
a Pilot, a Gentile (called in their language Goſarate)
whoſe name was Canaca, making excuſe that hée had not
ſent him ſooner, and ſo the king and the Generall remained
friends, and continued the peace before concluded vpon betwéene
them.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine Generall departed from Mylynde,
came to Calicut, and of what greatneſſe and nobleneſſe
that citie is. Cap. 13.
               
                  
                  THE Captaine Generall béeing thus prouided
of all things neceſſarie for his voyage,
departed from Mylynde towards Calicut
vpon the Tewſday, being the 22. day
of Aprill, and from thence he began to cut
ouer a goulfe, which is of ſeauen hundreth
and fiftie leagues, for the land there doth make a certeine
great valley, which doth runne along the coaſt from the
North to the South, and our voiage in demaunding of Calicut,
lay to the Eaſtward, in following whereof the next
Sunday our men ſawe the North, which a long time before
they had not ſéene, and alſo they ſawe the South, of
which good fortune they thanked God, in that it repreſented
as then to them winter of the Indias, & where alwaies
in that goulfe are great ſtormes, they now found none, but
rather faire weather: The Fridaye being the .xvii. daye of
May, and xxiii. daies next after their departing from Mylynde
(in which time they had ſéene no land) they then diſcouered
& came to ſight of land.They wer 23. dayes, & ſavve no lād after theyr departure from Mylinde. And the Fléete béeing viii.
leagues of ſeaboord from the ſhoare: the land ſéemed high:
their Pilot whoſe name was Canaca, did as then let fall
the Plommet, & found fortie fiue fathom, wherevpon to auoide
and apart himſelfe from that coaſt, he made his way
to the Southeaſt, & vppon the Saterday he made to landward,
howbeit he ranne not ſo néere the ſame as he might
certainly knowe it, but he perceiued by ſmall ſhowres of
raine, which fell as they made towards land, y• they were
on the coaſt of ye 
                  Indias, for y• at y• preſent time of ye yere,
y• winter is euer in thoſe Indias. The ſunday, being ye xx. day
of May the Pilot ſawe certeine high hils, which were ouer
the Citie of Calicut, and came ſo néere to land, that he did
reknowledge the ſame, and with great ioy and pleaſure, demaunded
of the Generall Albrycias, ſaieng that this was
the land, which he and his companie ſo greatly deſired to
ſée, and come to. The General repleniſhed with ioy of that
good fortune▪ gaue Canaca his demaund, & forthwith went
to praier, ſaieng the Salue, wherein they gaue God greate

thanks, for this their happie and ſafe arriuall vppon that
coaſt, and in ſight of the place, which they ſo earneſtly longed
for to ſée, when praier was done they made great ioy,
and feaſted on ſhipboord, and the ſelfe ſame daie in the euening,
the Generall came to an Ankor two leagues from
Calicut,
                  The Fleet arriueth at Calicut & the maner of the people there and immediatly came certeine people of that land
in fowre boates called Almaydyas, to our Fléete, to vnderſtand
what ſhips theſe were, hauing neuer before ſéene
any of that making, come to that coſt: Theſe people came
all naked, ſauing that their members were couered, with
little péeces of linnen cloath: they are browne people. At
their comming to vs ſome of them entered into the Generalls
ſhippe, and albeit the Pilot Goſerate, tolde him that
they were Fiſhermen, a poore kinde of people (for ſo they
call all ſuch as bee poore men in the Indias) yet hée receyued
them all well, and commaunded his men to buye of
their Fiſh, which they brought with them: And hauing
ſome talke with them, he did vnderſtand that, that towne
was not Calicut, for it was they ſaid further off, & offered
to carrie our Fléete thether: Wherevpon the Generall required
them ſo to doe, and therewith departed thence, and
were brought by thoſe Fiſhermen to Calicut, which is a
Citie ſcituated on the Coaſt of Malabar, which is a Prouince
of the ſecond Indias, that hath his beginning in the
Mount Dely, and endeth at the end of Comory, which is
in lentgh thréeſcore leagues and one, and fiftéene in
breadth: All the Countrie lyeth lowe, and is apt to be
couered with water: Ther be many Ilandes in the ſame, &
it doth enter into the Sea Indico: There is a verie high
hill which diuideth the limits betwéene them, and a great
kingdome called Narſinga: The Indians do report that this
land of Malabar in olde time was maine Sea, and ran as
far as ye hill where now the Ilands of Maldiua are, which
were then firme land, & did couer & diſcouer ye other of Malabar,
in which are many and pleaſaunt Cities, & thoſe alſo
very rich, by reaſon of ye trade they haue principaly with thē
of Calicut, which in riches & vice doth excel al in our time,

whoſe foundation was on this ſort: This Prouince of
Malabar was in the olde time gouerned altogether by one
king, who made his aboade in the Citie of Conlan, and in
the laſt kings daies of this land (whoſe name was Saranaperimal,
and died ſixe hundreth yeares agone) the Moores
of Meca diſcouered the Indias, and came to the Prouince
of Malabar, the inhabitaunts wherof then were Gentiles,
and the king himſelfe was a Gentile: From the time of
the comming of theſe Moores, they beganne to account, the
yeares as we account, from ye birth of our Lord God: And
after they came thether, they grew into ſuch familyaritie
with this king, and hée entered into ſuch conference & good
opinion of their lawes, that he renounced the manner of religion
of his owne Countrie, and minded thence forth to
imbrace theirs, and the loue and liking he had of this ſect
of Mahomet ſo déepely tooke roote, and entered into his
heart, that he determined to goe and ende his lyfe, in the
houſe of Meca: Thus béeing reſolued, for the loue he bare
to that ſect, to abandon and leaue his kingdome for euer,
and goe with them, before his departure he imparted to
his kinred,The firſt & ſtrange inſtitutiō of the kingdōe of Calicut. and diuided amongeſt them all his Lordſhips,
and territories, and hauing diſtributed and giuen the ſame
ſo farre forth, that there remained to him no more but xii.
leagues of his Countrie, which laye néere to the ſhoare,
where he meant to imbarke himſelfe, the which was neuer
before inhabited, & therfore he then gaue ye ſame to a coſin
of his, which then ſerued him as his Page: commaunding
y• the ſame circuit ſhold be inhabited in perpetuall memorie,
of his imbarking there: To the ſame his kinſman hée
alſo gaue, his ſwoord, & a towell after the Moriſco ſort, as
things apperteining and incident to the eſtate, & gaue commaundement
to all the Gentlemen to whom he had giuen
all the reſt of his lands, that they ſhould be obedient & true
ſubiects vnto him, and to take him for theyr Emperour,
(the kings of Conlan and Canamor onely except) whome
alſo he commaunded and charged, & likewiſe al the others,
that they nor no other Lordes ſhoulde coine money in the

Prouince of Malabar, but onely the King of Calycut. So
hauing thus beſtowed and giuen his lands, poſſeſſions and
dignities, as he thought good, and ſet euery neceſſary thing
in order, for eſtabliſhing his determinate will and pleaſure,
he then imbarked himſelfe there, wher now Calicut is builded
and ſcituated, and for that the King did there imbarke
himſelf to go towards ye houſe of Meca, ye Moores then took
ſuch deuotion towards that place, that they and all their poſteritie
euer ſince that time hitherto would not, nor yet
will take any lading but out of that Port. And from that
time afterward, they came no more to the Port of Coulan,
as vſually they did before, by meane and occaſion whereof,
the ſame grew to ruine, and was deſtroyed, eſpecially when
Calicut was once builded, and that many Moores came and
inhabited the ſame. For as they were Merchaunts of great
dealings, ſo came they thether, and made there the greateſt
and richeſt Faire or Marte of all the Indias, finding there
all the Spices, Drugs, Nutmegs, and all other things that
could be wiſhed, as all kindes of precious ſtones, pearles, &
ſéede of pearle,Laker is a kinde of gum that procedeth of the Ant. Muſke, Saunders, Aguila, fine Diſhes of
earth, Laker, gylted Coffers, and all the fine things of the
Chyna, Gold, Amber, Waxe, Iuorie, fine and cou
                     •
                  ſe cotten,
as well white as dyed in colours, much rawe ſilke, & ſilke
twiſted, and all kinde of linnen cloth of ſilke, and golde, and
cloth of golde, and cloth of tiſſew, chamlets, graine, ſcarlets,
carpets of ſilke, Copper, Quickſiluer, Vermilion, Allome, coralls,
Roſe waters, and all kinde of Conſerues, ſo that ther
is no kinde of Merchandiſe of all the world, which coulde
be demaunded, but it ſhould be found there. Moreouer, it
was very quiet, for that it was ſcituated along the Coaſt,
the which lieth almoſt open, and very daungerous: it is inuironed
& ſet round about with many Orchards, in which
are many ſorts of fruits of that lande, and many hearbes,
and excellent waters. Alſo they haue many Palme trées,
and other ſorts of trées. In this lande there is but ſmall
ſtore of Rice, which is ther a principall victuall, as amongſt
vs our Wheate is, but there commeth from other places

great aboundaunce thereof, as in like manner there doeth of
other victualls. The Citie is great, and all the houſes be of
ſtraw, (onely the houſes of their Idolls, Chappels, and the
Kings houſes except) which are of lyme and ſtone, and couered
with tyle, for none but they are permitted by theyr
lawes to haue anye other manner of building then with
ſtrawe. It was inhabited by Gentiles of ſundry ſects, and
by Moores which were great Merchaunts, and ſo rich, that
ſome of them had fiftie ſhips. There is no ſuch ſeaſon of
Winter, but that there may lye in that Harbour ſixe hundred
ſhippes. They haue there a ſhore whether they do cary
them with ſmall trauaile, for that they be made without
nailes, ſowed with ropes of Cayro, and pitched vpon, they
haue no quiell, but are flat bottomed.
            
            
               ¶Of what great power the King of Calicut is, and
of his vſe and cuſtome: likewiſe of the other
Kings of Malabar, and how the Nayres do liue.
Chapter. 14.
               
                  FOr that this Citie was of ſo great a trade,
and alſo the Countrey round about, ſo inhabited,
which increaſed ſo largelye the
Kings rents, it came to paſſe, that he grew
to be ſo rich of money, and ſo mightie in
power by multitude of people, that in one
daye he was able to leauie and make in a readineſſe thirtie
thouſand fighting men, and in thrée dayes ſpace, one hundred
thouſand. They called him Samoryn, which in theyr
tongue is Emperour, for ſo he was among the Kings of
Malabar, and there were no more but two beſide him: that
is to ſay the King of Coulan and the King of Canauor:
For albeit the others were called Kings, yet were they
not ſo.
               
                  
This King of Calycut was a Bramene,
                  The election and ſuce
                        •
                     isiō of the kings of Calicut. as others his
Predeceſſours alſo were, which amongſt the Malabars are
Prieſts, and for that it is a cuſtome and auncient order obſerued,
that all the Kings doe dye in one Pagode, which is
the houſe of praiers to their Idolls, he is elected for that
cauſe, for alwayes in the ſame houſe there muſt be and is,
a King to ſerue thoſe Idolles, and when he that ſerueth
there doeth dye, then muſt the King that then raygneth
and gouerneth, leaue his Empire, and goe ſerue in that
place as the other did, and into his place and Kingdome,
they elect and put an other, that ſhall ſo ſucceede
him.
               And if anye of them that is in poſſeſſion of the Kingdome,
refuſe to goe into the Pagode, (the King that then
ſerueth in the ſame béeing dead) they will then inforce him
thereto which ſo refuſeth, although it be againſt his will.
Theſe Kings of Malabar be browne men, and goe naked
from the gyrdell vpwarde, and from thence downewarde,
they be couered with cloath of ſilke and of Cotten: ſometime
they put vppon them ſhorte gownes, which they doe
call Baſus of ſilke or cloath of golde, and of ſcarlet with
very rich ſtones: and eſpeciallye the King of Calycut excelleth
in thoſe attires and Iewells. They be ſhauen,
leauing vpon the vpper lip as the Turkes vſe, the hayre
vnſhauen. They be ſerued but with ſmall eſtate, eſpeciallye
at theyr meate, whereof they haue but lyttle:
But the King of Calycut is ſerued, with greater Eſtate.
               Theſe Kings doe not marrie, nor obſerue the Lawe
of marriage,the kings Lemman vvith hir ſtate and allovvāce but yet they maye haue a Lemman of the
houſe of the Nayres, which amongeſt the Malabars are
Gentlemen, and ſhée hath hir houſe by hir ſelf, neere

for hir charges and maintenaunce, that ſhe maye haue
plentifullye of all thinges to hir contentation, vppon
that Stypende aſſigned hyr.
               And when any diſliking is had of hir by them, they may

alwayes leaue hir and ſuch children as they haue by hir, be
not taken or accompted for theyrs, neither doe they inherite
the Kingdome, nor anye thing of theyrs.
               After they be men, they are had in no more eſtimation,
then that is incident vnto them from the mothers bloud and
parentage. Their brothers doe inherite if they haue any, if
not, then their ſiſters children ſhall, who doe not marry, neither
yet haue any certaintie of their huſbands. They bée
very frée and at libertie, to chooſe thoſe of whom they lyke,
and be ſuch as are beſt eſtéemed of. They haue verye great
rents allowed them: and when anye of them come to the
age of ten yeares, (for at that time they are to be knowen
of men) their kinred then doe ſende forth out of this kingdome,
for a young man Nayre, and preſenting him with
gifts, earneſtly requeſt the ſame to take hir virginitie, who
then receiueth hir with great ioy, and after ſhe is thus vſed,
doth tye about hir necke a Iewell, which ſhe doth carry and
weare alwayes during hir life, as a thing in great eſtimation,
& for a token of the libertie giuen hir by that act, to do
with hir bodie afterward for euer, what ſhe will: for without
this manner of ceremonie, they may not know any mā.
Theſe Kings ſometimes haue warres one with another, &
they in their owne perſons goe into the fieldes, yea, and if
néed ſo require, they alſo fight: when they die, they be caried
out from their pallaice into a plain field, wher they be burned
with great quantitie of wood of ſanders & a ſwéet wood
called Aguila. At this burning are alwaies preſent all his
brothers, & néereſt kinred, and al the noble men of the countrey.
And they make ſtaye of him from burning after his
death thrée daies, that they all may repaire thether & come
together, to ſée and viewe whether he came to his death naturallye,
or whether he were killed: for if he dyed by
force of anye mans hande, then are they bounde to
take reuenge thereof.
               After hée is burned, and all the aſhes buryed, they
doe all ſhaue themſelues without leauing any hayre, yea,
euen of the leaſt childe that is a Gentile.

All of them in generall doe then ceaſe from eating of Betele,
during the ſpace of thirtéene daies, and he that doth
eate the ſame infringeth their law, and therefore they wil
cut his lips, and that by iuſtice: In all this time, the prince
which ſhall ſuccéed doth not command nor gouerne, which
is done of purpoſe, to ſée whether in that time anye man
will come to ſaie or obiect any thing againſt him. Theſe
things and daies, thus done and paſt, the noble men of the
Countrie doe cauſe him to bée ſworne, to all thoſe lawes &
cuſtoms, which were made by his predeceſſour, and to pay
all his debts: Alſo that hée ſhall trauaile to recouer whatſoeuer
things of his kingdome before were loſt: This oath
he taketh hauing his ſwoorde in his lefte hande, and in the
right hande a Candle burning, which hath a ring of golde
vppon it, which he toucheth with two of his fingers, and ſo
taketh his oath. This being done, they throwe or powre
vpon him a few graines of Rice, with many ſuch other ceremonies,
in dooing whereof they ſay many prayers, and
he worſhippeth then the Sunne, three times, which ſo done,
the Caymayles, that be Lords by parentage doe immediatly
holding the ſelfe ſame Candle, ſweare to be true ſubiects
vnto him.
               The thirtéene daies béeing ended, they all then doe
eate Betele againe, and fleſh and fiſh as before, the king
onely except, who then taketh thought and ſorroweth for
the death of his predeceſſour: whoſe manner of mourning
is thus: He muſt not by the ſpace of one whole yeare, eate
any fleſh or fiſh, or yet Betele, neither muſt he ſhaue his
beard, nor cut his nailes, nor eate but once in a daie, and
muſt waſh himſelfe all his bodie ouer, before he doe eate,
and praie certeine houres in the daye: After the yeare is
paſt and ended, he then vſeth a certeine ceremonie for the
ſoule of the king his predeceſſour, which is much like to our
Dirge, whereat are aſſembled an hundreth thouſand perſons,
at which time he giueth great almes, when this ceremonie
is finiſhed, they then confirme the Prince for inheritour
of the kingdome, and ſo all the people do depart.

The king of Calicut and all the other kings of Malabar,
haue one eſpeciall man that hath the charge for adminiſtration
of iuſtice, and doth command & is obeyed in all other
matters of gouernement as amplie as the king himſelfe.Naires, & vvhat theyr degree, office, & calling is.
The men of warre which the king of Calicut & the other
kings haue, are Nayres, which be all Gentlemen, and are
appointed to no other office or affaires, but to fight when
néede requireth. They be all Gentiles, and carrie their armour
wherewith they fight themſelues, which is bowes,
arrowes, ſpeares, daggers made like a hooke, and targets,
and march with them very honourably and gallantly, but
they goe naked, carrieng onely certeine linnen cloth of cotten
painted, with the which they couer themſelues from
the girdle to the knée, they are bare footed: and weare vppon
their heads certeine towels. They all liue by the king, and
by the noblemen of the countrie, of whome they haue ordinarie
ſtipends and allowaunce for their maintenaunce:
They doe ſo greatly eſtéeme and make account of theyr
gentrie, and of their cleanlineſſe, that they will not touch any
huſbandman, neither permit any of them to come into
their houſes. The huſbandmen are bound when they goe
in the ſtréetes to crie with a lowde voyce, and ſaye, Hoo
they goe, for if theſe Gentlemen doe come, and bid them
goe out of the way, and they doe not obey their commaundement
therein: then may they kill them: The king cannot
make Gentlemen, except they be of the ſtocke of Gentlemen.
They ſerue very well and faithfully, with them of
whome they haue their interteinment, and vnder whoſe
obeyſaunce they liue, not ſparing by night nor daie, anye
opportunitie of time for ſhewe of their beſt indeauour in
ſeruice of the ſame, nor making anye account of meat
or of theyr perſon or of ſléepe, whenſoeuer their trauell or
dilligence, may take effect or purpoſe of well doing. They
haue ſo ſmall charge and occaſion of expence, that with
halfe a crowne a péece (which is their ordinarie allowance
for one moneth) they may very well and ſufficiently, mainteine
themſelues, and each of them a boye to ſerue him.

The Nayres by the law of the country, cannot marry, and
for that cauſe they haue no children certain, but thoſe which
they haue are begotten of Lemmans, with which thrée or
fowre of them do lie, by accord & agréement had and determined
amongeſt themſelues, hauing one woman onelye to
ſerue that purpoſe, vnleſſe any cauſe or quarrell growe amongeſt
them, and euerye one of them ſhall be with her a
whole daie, accompting from the one halfe of the daye preſent
wherein he commeth, to the other halfe of the day next
following, at which time he departeth from hers, and then
commeth another, who continueth the lyke time: Thus
they paſſe ouer and ſpend their life time without care and
trouble of wife and children: They mainteine their lemmans
verie well according to their degrées and birth. And
if any of them will at any time leaue and forſake her, they
may at their pleaſure doe it, and likewiſe ſhe maye refuſe
anye of them at her will. Theſe women are all Gentlewomen,
for the Nayres amye not take anye Countrie women,
and they alſo doe not marrie: And for that there bée
ſo many men to one women, they take not them for theyr
children which bée begotten of her, although the ſame bée
lyke vnto them: and therefore theyr brothers children, doe
inherit their lands, and haue their goods: This lawe that
theſe Gentlemen ſhoulde not marrie, the king ordeined and
made, for that they hauing no wiues nor children, on whom
they ſhould haue care and fixe their loue, might the better
indure the warres, and liue at more libertie to ſerue in the
ſame.
               And becauſe they are Gentlemen, and that they ſhould
be the more animated and incouraged to liue in that order,The Calicutiās kill no kine for they vvorſhip them.
and to ſerue well, they be ſo priuiledged, that none of them
can be impriſoned for any cauſe, nor be put to death by any
meane of ordinarie iuſtice: Howbeit when one of them
doth▪ kill another, or elſe doth kill a Cowe, (which amongſt
them is taken for a greate ſinne, for that they worſhippe
them) or ſléepe or eate with a countrie woman, or ſpeake
euill of the king.

Then will the king, hauing true information of any of theſe
offences, giue out his warrant in writing vnder his owne
hand, directed to one Nayre, commaunding him therby, that
he with two or thrée other, doe forthwith kill the Nayre,
that hath ſo offended and ſinned contrarie to the Law: By
vertue of which warrant, they hew and cut him with their
ſwoords, whereſoeuer they doe finde him, and when he is
dead, they hang vpon him the kings writing, to the end that
all men may know and vnderſtand wherefore they killed
him: Theſe Nayres cannot take their weapons, nor enter
into any combat, before they be armed knights: when they
atteine to the age of ſeauen yeares, they bée forthwith ſet to
learne to play at all weapons; & to the ende they ſhould bée
very perfect, their Maiſters doe hale and wreſt the ioyntes
of their armes, and afterward they teache them their fence
ſuch as bée apt for the ſame: The weaponnes that are
moſt vſed amongeſt them be Swoords and Targets.
The Maiſters which teach them, be graduats in the weapons
which they teach, and they bée called in their language
Panycaes. They be reuerenced amongeſt the Nayres, &
euery ſcholler of theirs whatſoeuer, although he be olde, or
if hée be a great noble man, ſhall at all times when he ſéeth
him, doe to him reuerence and worſhip, and this by lawe is
ordeined: and further all of them are bound to take at their
hands a leſſon two monthes in euery yeare, during theyr
liues: By reaſon whereof they be very perfect and ſkilful
in theyr weapons, and for that cauſe they greatly eſtéeme
of themſelues.
               When any of them will be an armed knight, hée then
goeth well accompanied with all his kinred and friends, &
preſenteth himſelfe before the king, to whome he firſt offereth
thréeſcore Fannons of golde, which is a certeine kinde
of money amounting to the value of thrée crownes. Whervpon
the king doth immediatly aſke him, whether he will
kéepe and obſerue the order and cuſtome of the Nayres?
Wherevnto he aunſwereth and ſaith, yea. Then hée commaundeth
to put about him a ſwoorde, and laieng his right

hand vpon his head, ſaith certaine words as though he wold
pray ouer him, which he vttereth ſo 
                     〈◊〉
                   as none can heare
the ſame. Afterward he imbraceth him, ſaieng in his language
theſe words folowing, which in our tongue, doth ſignifie
or meane: Haue a regard to keepe theſe Bra
                        •••
                     es
and their Kine. This being done, the Nayre doth fall down
and worſhip the King, and from thence forth he remaineth
made Knight. Theſe Nayres when they yéelde themſelues
to liue and ſerue any King or Noble man, they binde themſelues
to dye with him, and for him: which bond they doe
ſo well obſerue and inuiolably kéepe, that if their Maſter in
any warre or otherwiſe be ſlaine, they will fight vntill they
are killed, which hath done the ſame acte, and if at that inſtant
they cannot accompliſh their wills, for that they were
not preſent at the déede doing, then will they goe afterward
and ſéeke them out, and neuer leaue them till they be killed
by ſome manner of deuiſe. They be great ſouthſayers, they
haue good dayes and bad dayes, they worſhip the Sun, the
Moone, the fire, and the Kine, and the firſt that they do méet
in going forth of their houſe in the morning: they doe eaſily
beléeue whatſoeuer vanitie. The Diuell is oftentimes
in them,their god or the diuell is many times in them. but they ſay it is one of their Gods or Pagodes, for
ſo they call him: but whoſoeuer or whatſoeuer it be, it inforceth
them to vtter terrible words & ſpeaches, which the
King doth beléeue. And the Nayre in whome the Diuell is
ſo entred, goeth with a naked ſword before the King, altogether
quaking & trembling, giuing himſelf cuts & wounds
ſaieng, I am ſuch a God, and I am come to tell thée ſuch a
thing, & in this manner he vſeth himſelfe, crieng out lyke a
mad man: and if the King make any doubt of that he ſaith
& doth not preſently giue credite to his ſpeache, then doth he
rore & ſend forth greater cryes & giue himſelfe greater cuts,
vntill ſuch time the King doe beléeue him. There be other
linages of people of ye 
                  Malabars, which are of diuers ſects &
cuſtomes, whereof to ſpeake were ouer tedious, & too long
to declare: all which doe obaye thoſe Kings, (the Moores
onely except) which by reaſon of the great cuſtomes they

paye for their Merchandiſe, are in great eſtimation among
them.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall ſent one of his baniſhed
men to Calycut, and how a Moore of Tunis
came and ſpake with him, by whoſe meanes
he ſent a meſſenger to the King of Calycut, and
how he returned anſwere to the Generall. cap. 15.
               
                  THe Captaine generall being come to an
Ankor without the Barre or Recife of
Calycut, he ſent one of his baniſhed men in
the ſelfe ſame Almaydes or boats which
they brought thether, for two reſpects: the
one to ſée what Countrey it was: the other
to make tryall how we ſhould be receiued, becauſe we wer
Chriſtians, beléeuing alſo y• the people there wer chriſtened:
& when this baniſhed man was landed, ther came immediatly
a great number of people to ſée him as a ſtranger: they
aſked of the Malabars which went with him, what he was?
Who aunſwered, that they déemed him to be a Moore, and
that he came with thoſe which are in the thrée ſhippes they
doe ſée without the Barre at Ankor. Whereof they of Calycut
greatly meruailed, for that his apparrell was far different
from that which the Moores y• come from y• ſtraights,
doe vſe to weare. Thus flocked about him much people, &
ſome that had the Algarauia tongue, ſpake vnto him, but he
hauing no vnderſtanding thereof could not nor did make any
aunſwere or ſpeaches vnto them, at which alſo they in
like manner greatly meruailed, for that being a Moore (as
they déemed) he did not vnderſtand the Algarauia language:
Neuertheleſſe going with him in this manner, and verelye
yet beléeuing he was a Moore, they caried him to the houſe
of two Moores,Bontaybo a More of Barbarie, dvvelling in Calicut which were naturally borne in Tunys in
Barbarie, and were then come to dwell in Calicut. To
whom being brought, one of them whoſe name was Bontaybo
could ſpeake the Spaniſh tongue, & did well knowe

the Portingals as he ſaid afterward, hauing ſéene them in
Tunys in the time of ye King Don Ioan in the ſhip called
Lareyna which the ſame King ſent thether manye times
to ſéeke for ſuch things as he and his ſubiects hadde néede
of. And as ſoone as the baniſhed man was entered into
their houſe, the Moore ſpake vnto him and ſayd: I giue thee
to the Diuell, who brought thee hether, which words was
vttered in ye Spaniſh tongue. And after he aſked him what
way he had gone and trauailed, that he was come to this
place: wherevnto the baniſhed man aunſwered & told him,
ſhewing alſo, how many ſhips the Generall had ther, wherat
Bontaybo meruailed, and wondred how they could come
by Sea thether. Then he aſked him what they ſought ſo
farre off? And he aunſwered that they came to ſéeke Chriſtians
and ſpices. Moreouer Bontaibo aſked why ye Kings
of Fraunce and Spaine, & the Duke of Venice did not alſo
ſende thether? Whereto the baniſhed man made aunſwere,
that
                     •
                   ye King of Portingale would not giue his conſent they
ſhould ſo doe: Bontaybo replieng thereto, ſayde, that he did
well & wiſely therein. Thus hauing talked a while, he gaue
him very good entertainment, and commaunded to giue him
certaine Cakes, made of the flower of Wheate, which the
Malabars do call Apes, and with the ſame honnie. After be
had well eaten, Bontaybo aduiſed him to go to the ſhips, &
ſaid he would goe with him, (as indéede he did) to ſee ye Captaine
generall. And being come to the Admirall which was
then entered, Bontaybo then began to ſay to the General in
Spaniſh: Good lucke, good lucke, many Rubies, many Emeraulds:
thou art bound to giue great thankes to God, for
that he hath brought thée where there is all kinde and ſorts
of ſpices, ſtones, and all the riches of the worlde.
               When they hearde him ſo ſaye, they all meruayled
greatlye thereat, for they before woulde not haue beléeued,
that there hadde béene anye man ſo farre off
from Portingale, that coulde vnderſtande theyr language.
               Wherefore with wéeping teares which they then plentifully

ſhed for ioye and pleaſure they had conceiued, as well
for the ſame, as alſo for their ſafe and happie arriuall there,
they then gaue to God moſt humble and heartie thankes
through whoſe onely fauour, good will, and pleaſure, that
good lucke and great good benefite, had happened to them.
And then the Generall imbraced Bontaybo, and cauſed him
to ſit downe by him, aſking him if he were a Chriſtian, and
how he came to Calicut? For aunſwere whereto y• Moore
told him of whence he was, and what he was, and how he
came to Calicut by the way of Cayro, alſo he ſhewed him
by what meanes he came to knowledge of Portingals, and
that alwaies he had bene a friend to them, for that in all
reſpects & at all times, their doings & manners appeared to
him to be good and worthy of friendſhip. Finally he ſayde,
that as he had in time paſt bene a friend to them, ſo would
he now at this preſent continue his good will, and was ready
and would be to doe all that in him was to pleaſure &
further them, and the effect of their purpoſe in comming thether.
The Captaine generall gaue him great thankes, and
promiſed to recompence him very liberally in reſpect of that
his good will, and for any pleaſure or friendſhip he ſhoulde
thenceforth ſhew to him and his company, he ſhuld be wel
aſſured to be thankfully conſidered of. Declaring alſo that
he was the moſt ioyfull man of all the world to finde him
there, and to haue him for a friend and an ayde, verely beléeuing
that God had ſent him thether, to giue an ende to the
enterpriſe of the voyage, which he ſo deſired in diſcouering
of thoſe Indias, and had entered into, and paſſed through ſo
many daungers by long tract of time to attaine vnto the
ſame, and now notwithſtanding his arriual ther, he thought
to haue but ſmall fruite of his trauaile, without his helpe &
friendly furtheraunce.
               Then he requeſted him to declare, what manner of
man the King of Calycut was, and whether he thought he
would receiue him with good wil as an Embaſſadour from
the King of Portingale.
               
               
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Bontaybo aunſwered, that the King of Calycut,
                  
was a very good man and of an honourable diſpoſition,The king of Calicuts greateſt reuenue riſeth by cuſtōe of Merchandiſe. and
that he no doubt would receiue him gladly, for Embaſſadour,
from a ſtraunge king, eſpecially if his comming were
to ſettle and intreate for eſtabliſhment of tract or trade of
merchaundiſe in Calicut, and had brought with him anye
kinde of Merchaundiſe for that purpoſe: For (ſaid Bontaibo)
as there doth grow great aduauntage and profit by cuſtome
thereof to the king, ſo is the ſame indéede the verye
principall rents or reuenewes he hath for his mainteynaunce:
Moreouer he informed the Generall that the king
at that inſtant was in a certaine village fiue leagues from
Calicut, ſcituated along the coaſt, named Panane, whether
he aduiſed him to ſend vnto him, & to declare of his arriuall
and comming thether. The Generall very well liking
of the ſpeaches and aduiſe of Bontaybo, did therefore giue
vnto him certeine gifts, and ſent with him two of his men
in meſſage to the king of Calicut,
                  Certeine meſſēgers ſent by ye Captaine generall to ye king of Calicut requeſting Bontaybo
to direct them on their waye to Panane, which he accordingly
did. Theſe meſſengers being nowe come before the
king, one of them whoſe name was Fernan Martyn, by an
interpretour which he had, declared vnto him, that he came
from his Captaine who is arriued in the port of Calicut
with certeine ſhippes, and is come thether from the king
of Portingale, of purpoſe to bring him letters, which the
ſame Captaine is readie to come and preſent vnto
him, if it ſo ſtoode with his good liking and pleaſure,
whereof to vnderſtand he then had ſent him, and his fellowe
there preſent. The king hearing this meſſage, commaunded
before he would make aunſwere thereto, to giue
to each of them a certeine péece of lynnen cloth made of
Cotten, and two of ſilke whith were very good, and euen
ſuch wherewith he was accuſtomed to girdle himſelfe:
And after theſe péeces were ſo giuen them, he then demanded
of Fernan Martyn, what king that was which hadde
ſent him thoſe letters, and how farre from thence his kingdome
was, wherevnto Fernan aunſwered and fully informed
him touching that demaund, declaring alſo that he was

a Chriſtian prince, & that all thoſe whom he had ſent were
chriſtians, hauing paſt many troubles and daungers vpon
the ſea, before their arriuall there at Calicut. The king hearing
all the diſcourſe of their voiage (wherof Fernan Martynes
ſomwhat at large informed him) did greatly maruell
at the ſame, & ſhewed himſelfe to be right glad, y• a Prince
of ſo great a power as the king of Portingale was, & being
alſo a chriſtian, would ſend an Ambaſſadour to him: And
therefore he ſent word to the Generall that he and his cō
                  panie
were hartelye welcome into his Countrie, requiring
him to bring his ſhips to an ankor néere, to a village named
Padarane (which is ſomwhat beneath the place where
they firſt came to an ankor) being a far better harbour then
that of Calicut, which is an open roade & very dangerous
for the ſhips: And appointed that from thence, the General
ſhuld go by land to Calicut, wher he wold be to ſpeak with
him: And therwt he ſent a Pilot, who conuaied the ſhips to
the port of the ſame village, howbeit when he had conducted
them to the bar thereof, the Generall woulde not enter
ſo far within the ſame, as y• Pilot would gladly haue had
him to haue done, fearing indéed that ſome thing might afterward
happen to his preiudice, if he ſhuld giue ouer farre
credit to thoſe people, & came within the compaſſe of anye
their forces, wherein he dealt very aduiſedly and wiſely, preuented
ſuch iniury as was offered him.
            
            
               How the king of Calicut ſent for the Captaine Generall
and after what ſort he was carried to Calicut. Cap. 16.
               
                  THe Captaine being come néere to this harbour,
his diſpatch was ſent him from y• 
                  Catuall
of Calicut, in ye which there was ſignified
y• he was come to Pandarane, by the
kings commaundement, with other noble
men, for to beare him company vnto Calicut,
and therefore he might at all times when y• it ſhould

pleaſe him, diſimbarke himſelf: But for y• the day was paſt
y• Captaine General excuſed himſelfe as at y• preſent, & alſo
y• he would firſt take counſell of his Captaines, & other the
principall of his Fléet, touching his landing, who being all
ioyned together, ſaid vnto them, y• he minded to go to ſée y•
king of Calicut, & to ſettle there a trade, and perpetuall
friendſhip. Againſt the which his going, his brother repugned,
alleadging y• it was not conuenient y• he ſhuld ſo doe.
For albeit y• they were chriſtians,Moores mortall enimies to chriſtians▪
                   yet y• ther were amongſt
them many Moores, which were to be feared leaſt thy wold
procure his deſtruction, ſince that they were his mortall
enimies. For when that they doe remember how thoſe of
Monſambicke and Mombaſſa, for onely paſſing by theyr
ports, would haue killed them all: What ſhould they looke
for, of thoſe of Calicut, knowing that they will mixture
themſelues with you & yours: quoth he, you ſéeking to haue
the trade where they haue the ſame, & ſo to diminiſh this
their profit and gaine? He tolde him therefore that it is the
ſooner to be beléeued, that they wold procure with all their
force poſſible to deſtroy him, yea, although they knew that
the beginning and end of the ſame did depend vppon his
death, and that therefore there woulde not lacke wayes
to put the ſame deuice in execution, who being once dead,
for all the griefe the king ſhoulde take therewith, yet hée
could not raiſe him againe to lyfe. And that ſo much the
more they béeing as it were naturall inhabitauntes there,
and he a méere ſtraunger.
               Moreouer who doth know what the king doth paſſe for his
death, and what ſhall become of them all after the ſame is
procured.Princes & Generalls ought to be eareful of their perſons in reſpect of their place and charge. And if ſo be that they ſhuld be caſt away altogether,
then were all theyr trauaile loſt. To excuſe all this,
and that they might remaine vppon this good aſſuraunce,
it were very good ſayd hée, that hée did not goe a ſhoare,
but that hee did ſende one of them, or ſome other, who
might doe that which he ſhoulde doe, for thoſe that are
Captaines in eſpeciallye Generalls ſhoulde not aduenture
themſelues in ſuch daungers, but where there were

ſuch great neceſſitie, that they coulde not otherwiſe excuſe
themſelues. Of this minde were all the reſt of the companie,
vnto whome the Captaine Generall aunſwered, that
although he knew or did vnderſtand yt by his comming it
were preſent death vnto him, yet he woulde not let but goe
and viſit the King of Calicut, and the rather to ſée whether
he would ſettle a friendſhip and trade there, and to haue
out of his Citie, Spices and other commodities, for that
the ſame (at our arriuall in Portingale) might repreſent as
a witneſſe the diſcouerie of Calicut. For if ſo be that at
the end of ſo long a time God did returne vs thether without:
then ſaid he, it would be hard to be beléeued that wée
had diſcouered Calicut: And our credit and honour woulde
ſtand in ſuſpence or ballance, vntill ſuch time there ſhould
come perſons of credit from thence, that ſhoulde declare
that to bée true which we had affirmed. Therefore doe you
not thinke but yt I had rather die then ſuffer ſo long time,
as we haue ſpent, and are lyke to ſpend, and others ſhall
come to diſcouer ye truth of our ſeruice: ſo that in the meane
while, thoſe that are enuious, ſhould iudge our trauaile as
it ſhuld pleaſe them, certeinly I had rather die then to tarrie
vpon the ſame: Much more friends I doe not aduenture
my ſelfe to ſo great a daunger of death as you do ſurmiſe,
neither yet that they ſhould remaine in ſo great danger,
as you doe preſuppoſe, for I goe to a Countrie where
there are Chriſtians and to talke with a king, which is deſirous
that vnto his Citie ſhould come many Merchants,
for the profit that doth ariſe thereby vnto him: for the
more Merchants that do reſort vnto it, the more wil be his
profit. I doe not goe thether to ſtay there many daies that
the Moores ſhall haue any ſuch time to vſe anye treaſon againſt
me. And for ſo much as I doe minde to talke with
the king it ſhall haue an end, and that within thrée dayes▪
and in this time you may be in a readineſſe: And as touching
the honour and credit that I ſhall get by making or
eſtabliſhing this trade, if it pleaſe God that he doe accept
the ſame I will not giue it for any treaſure. And the king

can ſettle the ſame with no other better then with me, for
that he will eſtéeme me, and beare ſome reuerence towards
me, being once knowen vnto him that I am the Captaine
generall of this Fléete, and the King of Portingales Embaſſadour,
rather then with any other perſon whatſoeuer.
Furthermore whoſoeuer he be that ſhall goe in my ſteede,
the King will thinke himſelfe to be mockt, or that I do not
eſteeme him, as one that is worthy that I ſhoulde goe to
ſpeake with him, or els that I doe not truſt him on his
word. Beſides all this, I cannot giue ſo large inſtructions
to him that I ſhould ſend thether, that he might doe in all
things which is néedfull as much as I my ſelfe: and if ſo
be that for my ſinnes he ſhoulde kill me, or take me as a
priſoner, it were a great deale better for me that ther ſhuld
chaunce to me all this for doing of my duetie, then to remaine
alyue, and not to doe the ſame. And you my friendes
remaining in the Sea and in good ſhips,The Generall determined to goe to Calicut as ſoone as you ſhal
heare that any of theſe things ſhall chaunce vnto me, get
you hence, and carrie newes of this our diſcouerie, and as
touching this, let there be no farther talke, for that I by
the grace of God will goe to Calicut to ſée the King. When
that his determination was perceiued, they all aſſented that
they were contented with his going: and therevpon they
appointed him twelue of his men to goe with him, that is
to ſay, Diego Dias his Secretarie and Fernan Martines the
interpretour, Iohn de Sala, which was afterward Treaſurer
of the houſe of the Indias. &c. So that with him in all they
were thirtéene. They appointed alſo that in his abſence ther
ſhould remaine for Captaine generall his brother. Alſo hée
gaue commaundement that he ſhoulde not ſuffer any man
to come aboord his ſhip, and all thoſe that were deſirous to
goe aboord to commaund them to remaine in their boate or
Almadias. Moreouer he left order with Nicholas Coello,
that he ſhould come euery day with his boate as néere vnto
ye ſhore as he could. Theſe things being ſetled, the next day
after being Mundaye, the xxviij. of May, the Captaine generall
did imbark himſelf with thoſe twelue before rehearſed,

they all being apparailed in the beſt attire that they had, &
their boates furniſhed with much ordinaunce, flagges, and
trumpets, which went alwaies ſounding, vntill ſuch time yt
ye Captaine general came to land, whereas ye Catual was tarrieng
for him, being accompanied with 200 Nayres, which
attended ther continually: beſids many others y• wer not of
that company, & beſides many alſo, yt were of yt towne. The
Captaine generall being diſimbarked,The Captaine Generall goeth a lād. was ioyfully receiued
of yr Catuall, & of ye others yt did accompany him, as though
they were very glad of his comming, & after yt he was thus
receiued, he was taken into an Andor, which y• King of Calicut
had ſent to bring him vpon, for yt in this countrey they
are not accuſtomed to goe a horſebacke, but in theſe Andors,
which are like vnto a horſlitter, ſauing yt they are wtout any
couer ouer them, & almoſt plaine, ye ſides therof are alſo very
low. Each of theſe Andors, when they will occupie ye ſame,
are caried wt 4. men vpon their ſholders, which alſo doth run
poſt wt thē, at ſuch time as ye king & noble men do make any
great iourny, or if ſo be yt they wil go a great ground in
a ſmall time: for they may trauell in ye ſame either ſitting
or lieng, as they wil themſelues. Alſo ther go with theſe certain
footmen, which carie with them hats, wherwith to couer
thoſe y• go in theſe Andors, which they do call Bueys, ſo that
by this meanes, they are kept from y• ſunne & the raine, ther
are alſo other Andors, y• which haue ouer thē a cane bowed
like vnto a hoope, which for y• they are made very ſlight, may
eaſily carie thoſe 2. men. The Captaine generall being moū
                  ted
in this Andor, departed wt the Catuall, who was carried
in another Andor, to a town called Capocate, but all ye reſt
of the cōpany went afoote, the people of the country was cō
                  maunded
by the Catuall to carie all ſuch apparel as our mē
had brought vp wt thē, which was ther redeliuered vnto thē,
& being in Capocate, they ſtaid to refreſh themſelues: where
the Captaine generall being in one houſe & the Catuall in
another they did eate,the fruits of Calicut & to al our men was giuen to eat ſodden
fiſh, wt rice & butter, beſides fruits of ye countrey, which
differ from ours very much, yet they are very good. The one

ſort of theſe is called Lacas, and the other Mangas, howbeit
they haue figs alſo. The water yt they did drinke, was very
excellent, as good as any in Portingal. Thus after they had
eaten, they went againe to imbark themſelues, for that they
ſhuld go vp a riuer, which from thence runneth into the ſea:
the Captaine generall did imbarke himſelfe with his company
into 2. Almadias, lieng the one cloſe to the other, which
in y• countrey they did call Enſangada. The Catuall wt his
traine were imbarked in many others, and the people that
came to the riuers ſide to ſée and view our men were without
number, for ſo much as that countrey is well inhabited.
And after that they had gone in this riuer about a league,
and that along the ſhores ſide, they ſaw lieng a ground many
great ſhips, the Captaine generall with the Catuall being
diſimbarked, did returne to their Andors, and following
their waye, there reſorted alwayes about them thouſandes
of people to ſée them, wherein they tooke ſuch a felicitie that
the very women alſo with their children hanging at theyr
backes, did not féele the waye they went in, following to
féed their eyes. From this place which I haue made mention
of, the Catuall did carrie him vnto a certaine Pagode of
their Idolls, into which when they were entred, he told him
that the ſame was a Church of great deuotion, which the
Captaine generall beléeued to be true, & to be ſome church of
the Chriſtians, & therfore he gaue the more credit therevnto,
the rather for that he ſaw yt ouer the principall dore therof,
there hanged ſeuen little bells, & afore the ſame there was a
pillour made of wier, the which was as high as the maſt of
a ſhip, vpon the top thereof there ſtoode a wether cock, made
likewiſe of wier. This church was as great as a good Moneſtary,
and was made all of frée ſtone, and couered or vauted
ouer with bricke, which gaue an outwarde ſhewe, as
though within ſide it ſhoulde be of verye faire workmanſhippe.
Our Captaine was very glad to ſée the ſame, for
that he thought himſelfe to be among Chriſtians, and entering
within this Church with the Catuall, they were
receiued by certaine men, naked from the girdle vpwarde,

and from thence downe to the knée, couered with certaine
linnen cloth made of cotten, with y• which their arme holes
were couered alſo, without any thing vpon their heads, and
vpon their left ſholders they had certaine number of thrids,
which came vnder their right ſhoulders, much like as the
Prieſts were wont to weare their ſtoles héere amongſt vs,
when they went to Maſſe. Theſe men are called Cafres and
are Gentiles, which ſerue in Malabar in their Pagodes, who
with a ſprinkle tooke water out of a certaine fountaine &
threw the ſame vpon the Captaine generall & vpon the Catuall
and on the reſt of the companye.Holy vvater of Calicut After all this
they gaue them Saunders in pouder to caſt the ſame vpon
their heads as they did héere their Aſhes,Holy aſhes. & as alſo they ſhuld
do ye like vpon ye brawns of their armes, but they could not
do ſo, by reaſon of their apparrel which they had on, but yet
they did not let to doe it on their heads: ſo going about this
Church, they ſaw many Images painted vpon y• wal, wherof
ſome ther wer y• had great téeth, which appeared to be ſo
monſtrous yt they were of an inch of length without their
mouth. Others ther wer yt had foure armes, & therwith wer
ſo ill fauoured, that they ſéemed to be very diuells, yt which
ſight made our men ſtand in doubt, whether the ſame wer a
Church of Chriſtians or no. Being come afore the Chappel
which ſtood in ye midſt of their Church, they perceiued yt the
ſame had a certain little roofe, made much after ye manner of
a tower, y• which was alſo builded of frée ſtone, & in a parte
of this roofe ther was a dore made of wire, by y• which a mā
might enter into it: the going vp to the ſame tower, was by
a ſtaire of ſtone: within this tower, which indéed was ſomewhat
dark, was incloſed in yt wall a certain Image y• which
our men beheld a far off, for yt they would not ſuffer thē to
go néere y• ſame,The Generall decerued, cō
                     mitteth Idolatry vvith the Diuell. ſaieng yt ther was none y• could go thether,
but thoſ y• wer Cafres, howbeit they made a ſigne to the Image,
naming y• ſame our Lady, giuing therby to vnderſtād
that it was hir Image. The Captain generall ſuppoſing the
ſame to be true, fell vpon his knées, with y• reſt of y• cōpany
making their praiers: but one whoſe name was Iohn de Sala,
                  
being in doubt whether ye ſame church wer of chriſtians
or not, for y• he ſaw ſo mōſtrous Images painted on y• wals,
as he fel on his knées ſaid, If this be ye diuel, I worſhip god.
The Captaine Generall that heard him ſay ſo, looking vppon
him laughing. The Catuall and his companie as they
came before this Chappell, did fall downe flat vppon the
ground with their hands before them, and this they did
thrée times, and afterward they aroſe and made their praiers
ſtanding.
            
            
               ¶How and after what ſort the Captaine Generall
was receiued in Calicut, & how hee
tolde the king his meſſage which he carried.
Cap. 17.
               
                  FRom this place he went forward on his
way, vntill ſuch time he came to Calicut,
and at the entering of the ſame, they carried
him wt the reſt of his company to another
Pagode, lyke vnto that which he had
ſéene before, and when that he would haue
entered into the Citie, the people were ſo many, as well of
thoſe that came forth of the ſame for to ſée our men, as alſo
of thoſe that went with him, that for the multitude of
them, he could not goe in the ſtréets, inſomuch that the Generall
meruailed to ſée ſo many people: and when as hée
ſawe himſelfe to be there, he gaue God great thankes, for
bringing him vnto that Citie, moſt humbly deſiring him,
ſo to guide him, that he might returne to Portingale, with
his whole requeſt & deſire. After that he had gone awhile
in that ſtréete, into which he entered, for that the people
wer ſo many that he could not paſſe through it, inſomuch
that thoſe that did carry him vpon his Andor, were driuen
to go with the Catuall into a houſe. Thether came to beare
the Captaine Generall companie, the Catualls brother who
was a noble man, and ſent by the kings commaundement
to accompanie him to the kings pallaice, who alſo brought
with him many Nayers, and before them went manye
Trumpets and Sagbuts, vppon the which they went all

ſounding. And alſo there was one Nayre which carried a
Caléeuer which he ſhot of, now & then. After yt the Captaine
generall & this noble man was thus ioyfully receiued, they
tooke their way ſtraight to ye pallaice, with a great noiſe, y•
which thoſe inſtruments & the people together made, which
after yt the Catuals brother was come, gaue place & followed
after them, with as great obedience as if ye king had ben
there in his owne perſon. There went along with thē fully
thrée thouſand men with their wepons, beſids thoſe yt ſtood
vpon ye penthouſes, & at their dores, which wer wtout number.
The Captaine generall was very glad to ſée how well
he was receiued, & ſaid vnto thoſe yt he caried wt him, with
a mery coūtenance, how litle do they thinke in Portingale
of this our gret receiuing, & with this they came to ye kings
pallace an houre before ye Sun ſet. The kings pallace (leauing
aſide yt the ſame was made of earth) was very great,The deſcriptiō of the kings pallaice,
which ſéemed to be of a goodly building, for ye great multitude
of trées which did appeare betwéene ye houſes, & theſe
wer ſtāding in goodly gardēs, in ye which wer pleſāt flowrs,
ſwéet hearbs, & foūtains of water to recreate ye king wtall,
for yt he neuer goeth frō this pallace til yt he departeth from
Calicut. Out of this pallace there came ſūdry Caimales, &
other noble men to receiue ye captain general, which brought
him to a certein gret court yt was right before ye gates, & frō
thence they wēt into 4. other ſeueral yards or courts. At ye
gate of each of which, ther wer .x. porters, which gates they
paſſed wt giuing ye people many & ſūdry blows, which ye porters
beſtowed vpō thē to make roome, yt we might go in: &
being come to ye laſt gate which was in ye houſe where the
king himſelf was, ther came forth an old little man, which
was Bramene Maior of ye kings houſe, who imbraced the
captaine general, & caried him in wt thoſe yt wer with him.
Bramene Maior is the kings high Prieſt, & the chiefeſt of
the religious mē of his gentility. At this entring the people
wonderfully preſſed thēſelues to go in, for that they ſee the
king but by great chaunce, as going but few times abroad
out of his pallace, & wold therfore haue entered wt our mē
to ſee him. The multitude was ſo great yt there wer ſome of

thē ſtifled, as alſo ther had ben two of our mē ſo vſed, if ſo be
y• they had not gone before, & it had ſmally profited to lay
on y• people wt their ſtaues to y• end to make more roome, if
ſo be ther had not ben many of thē hurt, wherwt they gaue
place y• our mē might enter. Moreouer thoſe noble mē which
did accompany the Captaine general, at this third gate entred
into the houſe wher the king was, the which was very
great: all the ſame was cōpaſſed about wt ſeats made of
timber,The deſcription of y• kings preſence chamber. one aboue y• other as the Theatres are: the floore of
the ſame was al couered ouer wt gréene veluet, & the hangings
about the wals were of ſilke of ſundry colours. The
king himſelf was of colour brown, & of a great ſtature & of
good yeres, he was lieng vpon his Eſtrado y• which was couered
ouer wt a cloth of white ſ
                     •
                  lke & gold & a rich eſtate
ouer him, Eſtrado is a ſeat made of boords. On his head he
had a night cap, made much like vnto a ſalet, after y• old ſort
which was couered ouer wt ſtone & pearle, & in his ears he
ware iewels of y• ſame ſort. He had vpō him a iacket of fine
cotten, ye buttons wherof were of great pearle, & the butten
holes were of gold thréed, he had about his middle a white
cloth made of y• forſaid cottē, y• which reched down vnto his
knées, y• fingers of his hāds & toes wer ful of rings of gold,
in ye which were ſet very fine ſtone, & on his armes & legs
many bracelets of golde: hard to this Eſtrado, there was a
certein yewer y• which had a high foot wrought al of gold, &
is of y• making of ye 
                  Flanders cups, & that plaine, albeit they
are greater & not ſo déepe:the kings Vitele. in this was ye 
                  Vitele which the
king doth chaw in his mouth, wt ſalt & Areca, which is an
apple no bigger thē a nut in Conſerua. This is eatē in all
ye 
                  Indias, for y• the ſame doth make a good breth, drieth y• ſtomack
& killeth y• thirſt, which being chawed in péeces hée
throweth y• ſame out of his mouth, & taketh another. And
for yt the king ſhuld not ſwallow y• ſame downe, there is
prepared a veſſel of gold for him to ſpit in, which is as big
or litle bigger thē a diſh, hauing a foot alſo of gold. Alſo he
hath a fountaine of gold which is ful of water wherwt hée
waſheth his mouth, when he had made an end of chawing
this Vitele which he is accuſtomed to take.
               
                  
This Vitele is miniſtred vnto him by an olde man which
ſtandeth hard by the Eſtrado, all the others that are in
this place holde their left hands afore their mouths, to the
end their breath ſhould not come where the king is, who
taketh the ſame for great diſcurteſie, to ſpit or to ſ
                     •
                  nieſe, &
therefore there is none that breatheth afore the king. The
Captaine General being come into this houſe, made reuerence
to the king, after the vſe of the Countrie, which is to
ſtoope or bowe downe thrée times, lifting vp his hands as
one that praiſeth God. The king immediatly made ſignes
vnto him as willing him to drawe néere vnto him, and
commaunded him to ſit downe in one of thoſe ſeates which
I haue ſpoken of, who being thus ſet, the reſt of his men
did enter and made him the lyke reuerence, whom the king
commaunded likewiſe to ſit down right ouer againſt him,
and that there ſhould be giuen them water for their hands,
that they might with the ſame refreſh themſelues ſince
they were very hot, for although it was winter yet it was
hot. After yt they had waſhed their hands, he commaunded
to be giuen them Figges and Iacas to eate, and that forthwith,
which they did receiue with a good will. The king
was very glad to ſée them eate, who was very earneſt in
looking vpon them, and did laugh thereat. Afterward hée
tooke occaſion to talke with the old man that miniſtred vnto
him this Vitele,
                  The cuſtome in drinking. and in the meane time our men did cal
for water, for that they were a thirſt, the which was giuen
them to drinke by an Yewer of golde, and when our men
did vnderſtand ye order of their drinking was to hold their
cup of height ouer their mouths, for y• the Malabars do take
the ſame for an iniurie to touch ye cup with their lips, they
did therfore hold the ſame ouer their mouth, in that order
that part of the water fell into their throates & made ſome
of them to cough, & vnto others it fell beſides their mouths,
and vpon their faces, which did runne downe vppon theyr
breaſts. All this the king was very gladde to ſée, who looking
towards the Captaine Generall, ſpake vnto him by
an interpretour, willing him to ſpeak vnto thoſe that were

there, & to tell them his pleaſure, & likewiſe to report vnto
him of theirs, with this the Captaine General was nothing
contented, for yt he thought the ſame a diſgracing vnto him,
& anſwered by ye interpretor yt he was the king of Portingales
Ambaſſadour, which was a mighty king, & that the
chriſtian princes did not vſe to receiue their imbaſſage by
a third perſon, but by themſelues, & that before very few, &
thoſe yt were of great credit. And for that he did accuſtome
the ſame order in ye other countries from whence he came,
he wold not therfore vtter his imbaſſage but only vnto ye
king himſelf, vnto which the king anſwered yt he liked wel
therof, & that it ſhuld be ſo obſerued, & immediatly he commaunded
the Captaine Generall & Fernan Martines to be
carried vnto another chamber which was adorned with ye
like eſtate as the other was, & as wel hanged, & after yt the
Captaine general was ther, y• king came thether alſo, but
our men remained where they wer firſt, & this was about
the Sun ſet. The king as ſoone as he was come into this
chamber went to his Eſtrado, there came no more with him
but his interpretor & the Bramene Mayor, & the olde man
which doth alwayes giue this Vitele vnto ye king,The meſſage that vvas ſent to ye king of Calicut from ye king of Portingal & controler
of his houſe. The king & they being ther together, he
aſked of ye captain general of what part of ye world he was
& what he wold haue: whervnto he anſwered, that he was
an Ambaſſadour of a chriſtian king of ye Occident part, & of
a kingdome called Portingale, beſides many others, inſomuch
yt he is of a great power both in poſſeſſions & people,
& much more in riches, & all other things neceſſarie, more
then any other king of thoſe parts, & hath ſo ben for ye ſpace
of theſe lx. yeres, ſo y• thoſe yt haue ben kings his predeceſſours,
hauing the fame brought vnto them, how y• in the Indias
there, were chriſtian kings & great noble men, in eſpeciall
ye king of Calicut, they were moued the rather to ſend
to diſcouer ye ſame by their Captaines, & to make friendſhip
with the king of y• country, & to take them for brothers as
reaſon doth bind the king his Maiſter now to do, & to viſit
them by his Ambaſſadors, not yt he hath any néed of their

riches, for that in his owne countries of golde & ſiluer and
other things of great value, he hath more therof then néede
did require. And as for thoſe Captaines whom he did ſend
vnto this diſcouerie, they haue gone in the ſame a yeare or
two, vntill ſuch time as they haue conſumed their victuals
and without finding of that which they ſought for, haue
returned to Portingale, & haue in vaine ſpent great ſums
of money. But the king Don Manuel which reigneth as
now, & is deſirous to make an end of this enterpriſe, which
was begun ſo long time agone, for that to them ther ſhuld
not lack ſufficient victuals, as there did vnto the others before,
did therfore giue him thrée ſhippes that were laden
therwith, commaunding him not to returne to Portingale
without the diſcouery of that king of the chriſtians which
is Lord of Calicut. And if ſo be yt he ſhuld returne without
bringing him relation therof, he would then commaund his
head to be cut off. And further he willed him y• if ſo be y• he
ſhould chaunce to arriue at the place where the king was,
to deliuer him two letters, which he wold preſent vnto him
the next day, for yt it was then ſomwhat late. And alſo that
he ſhould tell him that he was his friend & brother, requeſting
him that ſince that he doth ſend ſo far of to ſéeke him
out, that in recompence thereof he would accept of his kindred,
and friendſhip, and alſo that he woulde ſend him his
Ambaſſadour for the better confirmation of the ſame, and
yt frō thence forth they wold viſit one the other with their
embaſſadours, as it is accuſtomed amongſt chriſtian kings.
The king ſhewed himſelfe to bée well pleaſed with this
Embaſſage,An Ambaſſadour promiſed from Calicut. for he tolde the Captaine Generall that hée
was very well welcome. And ſince that the king of Portingale
would be his friend & brother, he would be the like
vnto him, and vpon the ſame wold ſend him his Embaſſadour,
which thing the Captaine Generall did deſire moſt
earneſtly, for that he durſt not ſhew himſelfe afore ye king
his Maſter wtout him. The king did therfore promiſe him
ſo to do, & that forthwith, he wold diſpatch him thether. After
y• he was deſirous to know ye whole eſtate of ye king of

                  Portingale perticularly, & how far of yt countrie laye from
Calicut, & how long he had ben vpon that voiage. And for yt
part of the night was well ſpent, ye king willed him to retire,
demaunding of him firſt, whether he would goe lye amongſt
the Moores or amongſt the Chriſtians, who anſwered
that he wold lye with neither of them, but alone, & by
himſelf. The king vpon his anſwere commanded a certein
Moore which was his factor to go & accompany ye Captaine
general, & cōmanded to giue him al things yt wer neceſſary.
            
            
               How the Captaine Generall was minded to ſende a preſent
to the king, but his company would not conſent
to the ſame, & how the Moores began to bring the
Captaine generall out of credit with the king. cap. 18.
               
                  THe Captaine generall being diſpatched to
go toward his lodging (although yt foure
houres of the night were paſt) the Catual
& the others y• had accompanied him before,
did now the like, & they all going afoot,
ther fell ſuch raine, that ye ſtréets ran
full therof, & therefore he was driuen to cōmaund ſome of
his men to carry him vpon their backs, (not for the water
only) but for y• it would be late or euer y• he could come to
his lodging, with this ye Captaine general was ſo angry, y•
he complained vpon ye kings Factor, demaunding whether
he meant to carry him about the citie all ye night or not,
who anſwered yt he could do no otherwiſe, for yt ye city was
great & ſcattered, & ſo he carried him to his owne houſe, to
reſt himſelfe a while. And afterward he gaue him a horſe,
vpon ye which he might ride. And for yt this horſe was wt
                  out
a ſaddle, ye Captaine wold not accept the offer, ſaieng, ye
yet rather he wold go a foot, & ſo he went vntill ſuch time
he came to his lodging, where thoſe y• did accompany him,
left him in a good lodging. And before his comming, his men
had brought thether his ſtuffe, where ye Captaine generall
hauing reſted himſelfe, & being in great ioy to ſée ſo good beginning
of his buſineſſe, determined on the next day being
Tewſdaie, to ſend a preſent to the king.

And for that he knew he could not ſend the ſame, but that
the Factor and the Catuall ſhould haue the ouerſight therof,
did therefore ſende for them that they might haue the
view thereof,A preſent for ye king of Calicut. who béeing come, he ſhewed the ſame vnto
them, which was foure Capi
                        •
                     ſis of graine, and ſixe hattes,
foure braunches of Gorall, twelue Almaſares, a fardell of
Braſſe, in the which there were ſeauen péeces, a Cheſt of
Sugar, two Barrels of Oile, & two of honnie. The Factor
and the Catuall hauing ſéene theſe parcels, began to laugh
therat, ſaieng, that ye ſame was nothing to preſent the king
withall, for that the pooreſt Merchant that commeth to his
port doth giue him much more then the ſame, wiſhing him
that ſince he would néeds giue him a preſent, to ſende him
ſome golde, for that the king woulde not accept any other
thing. At this their anſwere the Captaine general was offended,
& ſo he ſhewed himſelfe to be, ſaieng, that if ſo be he
were a Merchaunt or that his comming thether were to
trade, he would then haue brought him golde: But he was
no Merchaunt but an Ambaſſadour, which was the cauſe
he brought none with him, & that this which he doth now
ſend to ye king of Calicut, is his own goods, & not ye king his
Maiſters, who for that he did not certeinly know that hée
ſhould haue met with the king of Calicut, did therfore giue
him nothing to preſent him withal: but at his next returne
knowing for certeintie that he ſhall finde him, the king his
Maiſter will ſend him golde, ſiluer, & other rich things. To
this they anſwered and ſayd that it might be ſo, howbeit it
was accuſtomed in that countrie, ye whatſoeuer ſtranger he
be that doth come & ſpeake with the king, he ſendeth hm a
preſent, which is according to ye greatnes of his eſtate. Vnto
which the Captaine generall did reply, ſaieng yt it was
good yt their cuſtome ſhuld be kept, & that for the preſeruatiō
of the ſame, he did make him this preſent, which is of no
greater value, for the cauſe aboue ſaid: And therefore he deſired
them to ſuffer him to carrie the ſame to the king,
which if ſo be yt they would not let him doe that, then hée
would ſend the ſame backe to his ſhippes againe.

They aunſwered him that immediately he might ſo do, as
he laſt determined, for that they would not conſent that the
ſame ſhould be carried to the King. With this aunſwere
the Captaine generall was very angry, and ſaid vnto them,
that ſince they would not conſent that he ſhould ſende that
preſent to the King, he would therefore go himſelfe & ſpeak
with him, and would now returne to his ſhips. This was
his meaning, to enforme the King what had paſt about this
preſent. They ſaid yt it was well done ſo to do, but for ſo
much as they ſhould remaine with him in the Court a good
while, it were for them very neceſſary to goe about a little
buſineſſe in the meane ſpace, which they will go to doe, and
immediately retourne to goe with him, ſince that the King
wold not be pleaſed that he ſhuld go without them: for ſo
much as he was a ſtraunger, and for that there were many
Moores in the Citie. The Captaine generall giuing credite
to their words concerning their retourne, immediately
aunſwered them that he would tarry for their comming:Treaſon conſpired againſt the fleete
but they did not returne all that daye, for that they were
enimies to the Captaine generall, by reaſon of the Moores,
who were his enimies alſo, and had receiued newes what
he had done in Monſambicke, and of the taking of the Sambuco
in Mylynde, and that we were Chriſtians, and that
our comming was to diſcouer Calicut. Bontaybo alſo told
the Moores, that Spices were eſtéemed in Portingale very
much, and that as he iudged they wer not come to diſcouer
Calycut, but to ſettle there a trade, and to carrie Spices into
their Countrey, in the which there is of all ſorts of Merchaunts
that come to Calycut by the way of the ſtraights,
and great ſtore of golde and ſiluer, and hauing the Trade
ſetled there, woulde redowne vnto the King great profite
thereby. To the which words the Moores gaue great eare,
and made their reckoning vpon Bontaybos ſpeach, and allowed
the ſame: That we being Chriſtians and once come
to ſettle a Trade in Calycut, their commoditie then would
fall of the price they were at, and ſo would abate the moſt
part of their gaine. About this they layed their heads together,

to worke all meanes they could poſſible with the king,
to take the Captaine generall priſoner, and to commaunde
his ſhips to be taken alſo, and to kill all our men, and this
the rather, for that in no wiſe they ſhould retourne to Portingale,
to carry newes of Calicut. And héerevpon they ioyned
thoſe that were in credit with the King, and went vnto
him, and one in the name of them all, ſaid vnto the king:
That he ſhoulde not deceiue himſelfe with our men,the Mores oratiō to the king for
that the Captaine Generall was no Embaſſadour but a
théefe, that went to rob, which they knew for moſt certaine
by their Factors, which had certified them, that aſſoone as
we were come to Monſambicke, wher the Xeque went to
viſite the Captaine generall aboord his ſhippe, and ſent him
preſents, and eſtabliſhed with him friendſhip, and alſo giuing
him a Pilot to carrie him to Calicut, whether he ſaid
that he would goe. He after this ſhot his Ordinaunce at the
towne, with the which he killed of his Subiects, and tooke
certaine Sambucos laden with Merchaunts, and handeled
both him and his like vnto Enimies. And being departed
from thence to Mombaſſa, likewiſe vnder ye color of friendſhip,
ſaieng that he was bound towarde Calicut, the King
therevpon tooke occaſion to ſend to viſite the Captaine generall
aboord his ſhip, requeſting him to enter into his harbour,
who being determined ſo to doe, whether that it was
for that he ſaw within the ſame many ſhips, or yt he thought
he could not make his partie good, did flye away ſo faſt, that
he left one of his Ankors behinde him: and from thence alſo
the Pilot ran away, which he caried from Monſambicle,
for the ill lyfe which he lead with him, with whipping of
him, and putting of him vnto other puniſhment. And being
departed from Mombaſſa, and come néere vnto Mylynde,
did take perforce a Sambuco laden with Moores, of ye which
there were ſome that dyed in the battaile, & others that are
yet aliue remaining captiues. And for that thoſe that were
captiues willed him to carry them to Mylynde, ſaieng, that
there they woulde giue him a newe Pilot to carrye him to
Calycut, by that meanes onely he came thether. And hauing

there by the King of Mylynde bene receiued very well, yet
the Captaine generall would no more come a lande, fearing
the hurts which he had done, and taking the Moore priſoner
which the King had ſent to viſit him, and would not delyuer
him, vntill ſuch time that he had a Pilot ſent him. Wher
by it might well be conſidered, that if ſo be that he were an
Embaſſadour and were come to maintaine peace, he would
neuer haue vſed thoſe diſorders, but wold haue brought the
King a preſent with him. Of this his demeanour, we giue
thée to vnderſtand, as our dutie bindeth vs, that now thou
maiſt doe as thou ſhalt thinke good therein.The king remaineth doubt full vvhat to doe. With this
newes the king remained amazed, and told the Moores that
he would determine himſelfe what ſhall be thought moſt
conuenient: they ſéeing this, thought the ſame not to be the
waye to cauſe the King to doe as they would haue him, and
did afterward tell the Catuall thereof, who was in great
credite with the King, requeſting him to perſwade with the
King, not to receiue any ſuch Embaſſage as that was, and
the cauſe thereof the rather was, that he tooke this preſent
for ſo ſmall a valew. With this the Catuall went immediately
to the King, who told him what the Moores had ſaid,
to whom the Catuall gaue counſaile, to doe as the Moores
had requeſted him: immediately the King began to change
his countenaunce againſt the Captaine generall, but not ſo
much as the ſame might be perceiued. But as ſoone as the
Moores had knowledge by the Catuall concerning the preſent
that the Captaine generall would haue ſent to ye King,
and that he would not conſent therevnto, the Moores tooke
occaſion to go to ye Generalls lodging with a fained friendſhip
offering themſelues to inſtruct him what he ſhould beſt
doe,The fained friendſhippe of the Mores and talking with him they ſayd, that in that Country
it was accuſtomed that thoſe the which came from other
places about buſineſſe with the King, ſhoulde bring him
a Preſent, and therefore it were good that hée did ſende
him one. The Captaine Generall béeing offended with
that iniurye they hadde offered him, and that the Catuall
and the Kings Factour would not conſent therevnto,

did vpon the ſame take occaſion to ſhew them thoſe péeces,
the which he was minded for to ſend, who hauing ſéene the
ſame, they ſaide to the Generall, that the Catuall and the
Factor had great reaſon to be offended thereat, for that the
ſame was not a preſent for to be ſent to a King, neyther
would they wiſh him to ſend it, for that it would be iudged
that by the ſending thereof he did mocke the King: All
this they tolde him, and as they ſaid as friends, in ſhewing
him their minde. Bontaybo told him alſo in the ſame manner,
meruailing what was the cauſe he brought no other
things, ſince there was plentie of all things in Portingale
                        •
                     
                  
But the Captaine generall excuſed himſelfe, ſaieng: that
he was not certaine that he ſhould come to Calycut.
               
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall returning ſpake with
the King of Calycut, & how he gaue him licenſe
to returne vnto his ſhips. Chap. 19.
               
                  ALL this daye the Captaine generall was
greatly offended, for that the Catuall & the
Factor were not returned, ſo that he was
once determined to goe to the Court with
out them, yet he thought beſt to tarry till
the next daye, on which in the afternoone
they came, with whome he ſhewed himſelfe to be offended
for their long tarrieng. But they did aunſwere him touching
that matter nothing at all, but talked of other things,
and ſo went with him to the Court. And for that the King
was ſomewhat chaunged, as I haue ſaid, againſt the Captaine
Generall, he did not commaund him to come into his
preſence in thrée houres after his comming to the Courſie,
and then commaundement was giuen ther ſhould come no
more in with the Embaſſadour but two of his owne men,
with the which he was offended, for y• he thought the ſame
ſeperating from his men, was not meant well, did therfore

carry with him Fernan Martines, and one Diego Dias, ſhe
which was his Secretary. Being come where the King
was, he did not receiue him ſo well as at the firſt time, but
ſaid vnto him with a ſeuere countenaunce, that he had tarried
for him all the day before, and he came not. The Captaine
generall aunſwered, that he did deferre his comming,
for that he found himſelfe weary by reſon of the long way,
for he was very loath to tell him the cauſe why he ſtaid, for
that he woulde not giue the King occaſion to talke of the
preſent that he would haue ſent him: But it did well appeare
that the Catuall and the Factor would not haue hindred
the ſending of the ſame vnto the King, but for yt they
well knew, he would haue made ſmall account thereof. And
alſo they muſt of force haue told him that they had ſeene the
ſame. Neuertheleſſe it coulde not be excuſed, but that the
King ſpake vnto the Captaine generall thereof immediately
ſaieng:The king quarrelleth vvith the Captaine Generall. how that he had tolde him that he was belonging
to a great and rich King, and yet he brought no preſent
from him, but an Embaſſage of friendſhip onelye, and
therefore he could not tell what friendſhip he woulde haue
with him, ſince that he did ſend him nothing. Vnto this the
Captaine generall did aunſwere, that there was no maruel
that he did bring him nothing, for that he came not in aſſuraunce
that he ſhould méete with him. But now ſince that
he hath ſéene him he ſhould well perceiue what his King &
Maſter will héereafter ſende him, if ſo be that God wil giue
him leaue to carry newes of this his diſcouery. And if ſo
be that he will giue credite to his Letters which hée did
bring with him, he ſhall then ſée what the King doeth
ſend him word of. The King in ſtéede of demaunding his
Letters, aſked him whether the King his Maſter did ſende
him to diſcouer ſtones or men, and if ſo be that he did ſend
him to diſcouer men, how doth it chaunce then that hée ſent
him no preſent. And ſince that it is manifeſt that hée had
brought him nothing, he ſayd as then that it was told him
that he had a Sancta Maria in golde, requeſting of him the
ſame.
               
                  
The Captaine generall was partly aſhamed to ſée the
King ſo altered, for that he had not brought him a preſent.
And now moreouer to demaund without all honeſtie that
Image. To whom he aunſwered, that the Sancta Maria,
which they tolde him of, was made of woode, and gylded ouer
and not of Maſſie golde. And although that it were (yet
would he not depart therewith) forſomuch as the ſame had
preſerued him in the Sea, and had brought the ſame from
his Countrey. The King did not reply vpon this anſwere,
but demaunded thoſe Letters the which the King had ſent
him: whereof the one was in the Portingale tongue, the
other in the Arabian language. Theſe he tolde him were
ſent in this order, for that the King his Maſter did not know
whether of theſe two languages was vnderſtoode in his
Countrey. Wherefore he deſired that ſince the Portingale
language was not vnderſtood in his Countrey but the Arabian,
and that there were Chriſtians of the Indias that did
vnderſtand the ſame, one of thoſe might read his Letter, and
the rather for that the Moores are enimies to the Chriſtians,
of whom he was afeard, leaſt that they ſhould chaunge
the ſenſe thereof. The King commaunded them ſo to bée
read: howbeit there could be founde no Indian that coulde
read the ſame, or at the leaſt would ſhew himſelfe that hée
could read them. The Captaine generall ſéeing that there
was no other remedy, but y• the Moores muſt néeds read the
ſame, was driuen then to requeſt the King, that Bontaybo
might be one of them. This was done, for yt as he thought
he would ſpeake and vſe more truth then the others, for the
acquaintaunce they had with him. The King commaunded
the ſame to be read by other thrée, who hauing read ye ſame
firſt of all to themſelues,The effect of ye king of Portingales Letters to the king of Calycut & afterward with a loude voyce declared
to the King the effect thereof, the which was, That
as ſoone as the King of Portingale had knowledge, yt he was
one of the mightieſt Princes of all the Indias, & a Chriſtian,
he was deſirous to haue a trade & a friendſhip with him,
for that he might haue out of his Countrey, Spices, the
which he hath in great plentie, for which there commeth diuers

from many places of the world thether to buy ye ſame.
And therefore if ſo be he will giue him licenſe to ſende for
the ſame, that then he wil ſend vnto him from his kingdome
many things which he hath not in his, as his Captaine generall
and Embaſſadour will tell him. And if ſo bée that
with thoſe things he were not pleaſed, he will ſende him
money both of golde and ſiluer to buy them withall, & how
that as well of his Merchaundize as of the money, yt Captaine
generall could ſhew him part. The King hearing this,
as he was deſirous that for the increaſe of his rents there
ſhould come many Merchaunts vnto Calycut, ſhewed himſelf
to be wel pleaſed with this letter, & alſo made vnto the
Captaine generall a better countenaunce then he did before,
& aſked him what Merchaundize ther were in Portingale. He
named many, ſhewing how that of all he had brought with
him part, and alſo of their money, requeſting him licenſe
to goe aboord for the ſame, and in the meane while he wold
leaue in his lodging foure or fiue of his men. The King giuing
more credite to that which he ſpake, then to that the
Moores had told him, ſaid vnto him, yt he might go in a good
houre, & carie his men with him, for there was no neceſſitie
that they ſhould remaine a lande, & that he ſhould bring his
Merchandize, & ſell them as well as he could. With this lycenſe
he remained well content, for (as he ſaw ye King make
him at the firſt an ill countenance) ſo he thought yt he wold
not haue giuen him ye ſame, & with this licenſe he went firſt
to his lodging, being by ye Kings commandement accompanied
with the Catuall: and forſomuch as that daye was all
ſpent, he would, not goe aboord that night.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall hauing l
                     •
                  cenſe of the King
to go to his ſhips, was ſtaid by the Catuall in Pandarane.
Chap. 20.
               THe next daye after, which was the laſt daye of
Maye, the Catuall ſent to the Captaine generall
a Horſe, howbeit without anye furniture to the
ſame, vpon which hée might goe to Pandarane:
And for that the Horſe came after that order, he woulde

not accept his offer, but rather requeſted him for one of his
Andors, the which he ſent him immediately, and on the ſame
he went to Pandarane, and all his men came after him on
foote. There went to beare him company many Nayres, the
Catuall did remaine in Calicut, and when the Moores had
notice that he ſhould there ſtaye, and that the Captaine generall
was gone towards his ſhips, ſuppoſing that he went
for altogether, were ſore amazed therewith, wherevpon the
Moores tooke occaſion to goe to the Catuall,the Mores make a nevv conſpiracie. with large offers
of money to purſue the Captaine generall, and vnder a
fained pretence to lay hands vpon him and to take him priſoner,
for that they would finde occaſion to kill him: and he
by this meanes ſhoulde remaine in no fault thereof at all.
And albeit that the King would puniſh him forſomuch as he
did kéepe him priſoner, yet they would not feare but to get
him his pardon. With this bribe and promiſe he did depart
immediately, and went in ſuch haſt after him, that hée paſt
by our men which did remaine behinde the Captaine generall,
for that they were not able to goe much, by reaſon of
the heate. The Catuall hauing ouertaken the Captaine generall,
aſked him why he did make ſo much haſt, or wher he
wer now running away: this was ſpoken by ſignes, y• which
the Captaine generall did vnderſtand, who aunſwered him
alſo by ſignes that he did runne away to flye the heat. And
being come to Pandarane, for that his men as yet did not
appeare, the Captaine generall tolde the Catuall that hée
would not goe into the village, vntill his men were come,
and there he tarried for them in a houſe, wherein he reſted
himſelfe from the raine: howbeit they came not vntill it
was almoſt Sunne ſet, for ſo long he did tarry for them becauſe
they had loſt their waye. But after that they were
come, the Captine generall tolde them, that then it was
not time to leaue him, whereas if ſo be that they hadde
come ſooner, hée hadde bene as then in his Shippe.
               Wherevppon, immediatelye hée did demaunde of the
Catuall a Boate or Pinnace for to goe aboorde in, who
for that hée pretended an other thing, aunſwered

him, that it was verye late, and that the ſhippes did ride
farre, and going in the night he might miſſe them, and therfore
that it were a great deale better to tarie vntill ye next
day. To ye which the Captaine generall made him a plaine
anſwere, that if ſo be that he would not giue him an Almadias
or Pinnace, he woulde immediatly returne to the
king & complain vpon him, forſomuch as the king had ſent
him to his ſhips, and he would ſéeme to ſtay him, which
was very ill done, ſince that he was a Chriſtian as they
were. This was ſpoken with ſuch a coulour as if he wold
haue returned to Calicut.
                  Diſſimulation in ye Catuall The Catuall for to diſſemble
with him the more, did make him a countenance as though
he would giue him thirtie Almadias, if he woulde haue
ſo many. Howbeit he tolde him that he did counſell him
for the beſt, and to remaine. But if ſo be that he would goe
he was contented therewith. Thus on one parte he ſent
to ſéeke out Almadias or Pinnaces, and on the other part
commaunded the owners of the ſame to hide themſelues
out of the way becauſe they ſhuld not deliuer the ſame. In
the meane ſeaſon while they went to ſéeke thoſe Pinnaces,
the Captaine Generall went along the water ſide, and
for that he had an euill ſuſpition of their dealing, for that
which they had done to him in Calicut, he commaunded
Gonſallo Peres, a Marriner, with other two of his men, to
go before as faſt as they could, & ſée if they could finde Nicholas
Coello wt his boats to wil him to kéepe himſelf out
of the way, forſomuch as he was afeard leaſt yt the Catual
wold ſend to take his boats, with all thoſe that were with
him in the ſame, Gonſallo Peres with the other went about
that buſineſſe whileſt the Catuall went in the meane ſeaſon
ſo leaſerly to prouide for this boat, that the night drew
on, ſo that it was thrée houres within night ere he coulde
heare of any thing what hée had done, and what for that &
alſo to tarrye the comming of thoſe that went to Nicholas
Coello, the Captaine Generall was the willinger
to ſtay there that night. After that the Catuall had placed
the Generall in a Moores houſe, tolde him that he woulde

goe to ſéeke out Gonſallo Peres, & the other two that went
with him. Howbeit he came not backe till it was the morning.
And as ſoone as the Captaine Generall had fight of
him, immediatly he required a boate for to goe in vnto
his ſhippes. But as ſoone as the Catuall heard him, he then
ſpake vnto his Nayres that were there preſent in his language,
who afterward willed the Captaine Generall to cō
                  maunde
his ſhips to be brought néere vnto the ſhoare, and
that being done he ſhoulde haue licenſe to goe his waye,
with this the Captaine Generall was ſomewhat afearde,
howbeit he aunſwered him with a ſtout ſtomacke, that as
long as he was on land, he would commaund no ſuch matter
to be done, forſomuch as then his brother woulde iudge
him to remaine in priſon, and that he did commaunde the
ſame to be done more for feare then any thing els, whervpon
he wold immediatly depart toward Portingal, without
him.
               To this the Catuall made anſwere with the others that
were with him,The Catuals purpoſe opened. ſpeaking with a ſtoutneſſe, that if ſo be that
he would not doe that which was willed him to doe, y• then
they will not let him go a boord. To the which ſhewing
himſelfe to be therewith offended, he made anſwere that if
ſo be that they would not let him go, that then he wold returne
to the king of Calicut, and make his complaint, who
if then he would ſtey him in his countris, y• then he would
be verie glad to dwel in the ſame. The Catuall therevpon
willed him ſo to do, & to goe to the king to make his complaint,
but yet for all his ſaieng he would not conſent thervnto,
for that he had commaunded the doores of his lodging
to be kept ſhut, placing within the ſame ſundry Nayres with
their weapons. And if ſo that any of our men ſhould goe
forth, there were appointed many of the enmyes to withſtand
them. Neuertheleſſe it was Gods pleaſure that the
Catuall durſt not venture to kill the Captaine Generall,
nor yet any of his men for all that the Moores hadde bribed
him with a great ſumme of money, and for all that hée
was in great credit with the king, for hée ſtoode in ſuch a

feare thereof, that he durſt not doe it.
               Tho cauſe why he required the ſhippes to be brought to
the ſhoare ſide was, for that they being there, the Moores
might the better laye the ſame a boorde, and ſo take them
and kill all thoſe that were within them, which thing for
that it did ſo manifeſtly appeare to the Captaine General,
he would not commaund the Shippes to bée brought anye
néerer. And alſo for that the ſame was ſo appareaunt
vnto the others of his men that were with him. They
gaue him counſaile not to deale therein. The Catuall
ſéeing that he would not commaunde thoſe Shippes to
bée brought néere the ſhoare, and for that there was no
cauſe to ſtaye him or offer him any wrong, and ſéeing that
hée could not kill him, did then beginne to requeſt him to
bring his Sailes and the Rudder of the Shippes a lande.
With that the Captaine Generall beganne to laugh, ſayeng,
that he would neither doe the one, nor yet the other,
ſince that the king did giue him frée licenſe to goe without
any condition.
               And therefore hée willed him to doe what he would, and
how that of all the iniuryes which hée had offered him, the
king ſhoulde bée made priuie, who he knewe woulde doe
him iuſtice, but yet for all this, both hée and his remayned
in ſome feare of ſuſpect, although they did not outwardly
ſhew the ſame.
               At length the Captaine Generall with the reſt feigning
themſelues to be an hungred,The Generals vneffectuall excuſe. and that they were vnprouided
of victualls, did requeſt him that ſome of his men
might goe to prouide the ſame, and hée woulde remaine alone,
but for all that the Catuall woulde not agrée therevnto.
Nowe our men béeing in feare to ſée themſelues
in ſuch a daunger. Then came Gonſallo Peres, ſuppoſing
that the Captaine Generall had ben at his liberty, and
that they were tarrieng for him and the others, who tolde
him that hée hadde mette with Nicholas Coello, and with
the others which tarryed for him with theyr Boates a
lande.
               
                  
This newes being brought to the Captaine Generall, hée
was afeard leaſt the Catuall ſhould know thereof, which
if he had knowne indéed he would haue ſent Pinnaces and
many men in them,Gonſallo Peres ſent back to the ſhips for to haue taken them. Therefore did
he procure by all the meanes he could, that Gonſallo Peres
ſhoulde ſecretlye returne, from thence vnto their ſhippes,
and put themſelues in good order. And alſo that he ſhould
goe with them and informe them in what caſe he doth remaine.
Nicholas Coello hauing receiued this diſpatch,
did forthwith depart, and that in haſt, and immediatly after
he was departed, the Catuall was aduertiſed thereof,
who ſent after him ſundrie Pinnaces well appointed, but
yet they could not ouertake him, and therefore they returned
againe vnto the Catuall. Then the Catuall after that
they were come did once more requeſt the Captaine Generall
to write vnto his brother to bring the ſhippes néere
to the lande, but he could not perſwade the Captaine Generall
ſo to doe, ſaieng that if he ſhould doe it, yet his brother
would not conſent therevnto, and although he would,
yet he knew that the companye would not. To this the
Catuall did replye, that he ſhoulde not make him beléeue
that, forſomuch as he did well know that all things ſhould
be done as he would commaund. Howbeit the Captaine
Generall wold write no ſuch letter; for that he was afeard
of the bringing of the ſhips ſo néere the ſhoare, for the cauſes
aboue mentioned.
            
            
               ¶How the Catuall was contented that the Captaine
Generall ſhould goe to his ſhips, & after
that what chaunced. cap. 21.
               
                  AFter this ſorte they ſpent that day, in the
which our men remained in great feare,
forſomuch as in the night they were put
in a great yarde that was vnderfoote layed
with Brick, and compaſſed about with
walls, & alſo had to kéepe them far more

men then they had in the day. Then the Captaine Generall
perceiued by the countenance of his men y• they feared
leaſt they ſhuld be departed ye one from ye other yt next day
after, as he himſelfe ſuſpected the lyke, although he gaue no
outward ſhew thereof, but rather had a confidence, that
as ſoone as the king of Calicut had knowledge after what
ſorte they were ſtayed, would commaunde them to be releaſed,
for that he did neuer vſe with him double dealing, it
was thought that the Catuall did ſtaye the Captaine Generall
after this order,The generals conſtancye marueled at by the Catuall becauſe he ſhould giue him ſome reward.
And for that he would giue as it were no outwarde
ſhew that he was offended, he would néeds come to ſupper
to him that night, at the which they hadde both Rice and
Hens, which he commaunded to be bought the day before.
The Catuall did much meruaile to ſée how little they did
paſſe for their cloſe kéeping, after that ſort, and of the great
conſtancie of the Captaine Generall, that he woulde not
commaund thoſe ſhippes to be brought néere to the ſhoare,
nor yet condeſcended to any of the other his requeſt. And
for that hée thought that it was but a follye to kéepe him
priſoner, thereby the rather to conſtraine him to doe it, it
was Gods pleaſure to put him in the head to ſette him at
lybertie, for feare leaſt that the king ſhoulde knowe thereof,
for that he gaue him frée lybertie to goe to his ſhippes.
The next day which was Saterday the ſecond of Iune, hée
then tolde him, that ſince he had certified the king that he
would bring his Merchandiſe a land, he ſhould command the
ſame to be brought. For it was a cuſtome that whatſoeuer
Merchants did come to Calicut, he ſhould immediatly vpon
the ſame command his Merchandiſe to be brought a land
and his men alſo, and they not to returne vnto their ſhips,
vntill ſuch time that they had ſolde the ſame, notwithſtanding
as ſoone as the Merchandiſe were come, he would then
let him go aboord his ſhips. And although his wordes were
with the Captaine Generall of ſmall credite to ſend vnto
his brother a certeine diſpatch for them, yet he did not lette
to tell him, that immediatly he would ſende for them, if ſo

be that they wold giue him Almadias or pinnaces, in the
which the ſame might be brought, for that his brother
woulde not conſent that his boates ſhould come a lande,
vntill ſuch time that hée were there himſelf, with this the
Catuall was content for that he thought to make himſelf
poſſeſſour of the Merchandiſe, hauing a ſpeciall hope that
they were of a great value, as the Captaine Generall had
tolde him.
               Then he diſpatched two of his men with a letter vnto
his brother,The effect of ye Generals letters vnto his brother. in the which he had made relation after what
ſorte hée did remaine. And that he had no other iniury offered
him, but that he kept his lodging. And for any thing
elſe hée was very well, willing him that hée ſhould ſende
him part of the Merchaundiſe to content the Catuall withall,
that he might let him depart. And after that hée had receiued
the ſame, if then hée would not let him go, he would
then beléeue that hée did kéepe him priſoner, by the King of
Calicuts commaundement, who hée knew would not commaund
the ſame, except it were to take his ſhippes, which
hée would not doe, but hauing time to arme his owne
Fléet, & ſo to ſet vppon them, wherefore hée aduertiſed them
that if ſo bée were not ſet at liberty, immediatly after y•
the Merchandiſe were landed, that then they ſhould not remaine
there any longer, but goe their wayes toward Portingale,
& informe the king his Maiſter what had chaunced
vnto him, and alſo what hee had done, that there might
not bée loſt a Countrie of ſo greate a profite for Portingale
as that was, and alſo to tell him after what ſort that
hée did remaine there, and what confidence hée hadde in
his highneſſe that he would ſend him ſuch a Fléete of ſhips
and men, that by the ſame hée doth hope to be ſette at lybertie,
béeing aſſured that as nowe they woulde not kill
him.
               He that carried theſe letters béeing come to Paulo de
la Gama, did deliuer them vnto him, giuing vnto him large
inſtructions of all that which they had paſt, ſince they did
departe. Nowe Paulo de la Gama hauing ſéene this Letter

which was ſent him from the Captaine General,His brothers aply did ſend
immediatlye the merchaundiſe with an aunſwere to this
Letter, in the whſch hée ſayde, that GOD would not
permit him to retourne to Portingale without his companye.
And if ſo bée that their enimyes would not ſette
him at lyberty, that then hée did hope in GOD that hée
woulde ſtrengthen thoſe fewe that remained in the Fléet,
with whome and with the Ordinance that they haue, hée
woulde come and ſet him at lyberty, and of this hée might
make full accompt, and of no other thing.
               The Merchaundiſe béeing landed, the Captaine General
did deliuer the ſame vnto the Catual, and alſo to Diego
Dyas whome he lefte for▪ Factour of the ſame, and to
Aluora de Braga the Scriuenor, who remained in a houſe
which the Catuall had ſought out for them. In this ſpace
the Captaine Generall made himſelfe in a readyneſſe to
goe aboorde his ſhippes, but firſt the Catuall did reforme,
and make himſelfe friendes with him.
               After that hée was a boorde, hée would ſend no more
Merchaundiſe a lande, vntill ſuch time hée heard newes
the ſame were ſolde, neyther yet would goe anye more a
lande, becauſe hée would runne in no ſuch daunger, with
this the Moores were grieuouſly offended, for that they
thought that if ſo be that he would come a land, that there
they might doe him more hurte then a Seaboorde.
               And for that they woulde the rather ſo do, they beganne to
make a mocke at the merchandiſe which he had left a land.
Alſo they wrought all the means they could to hinder their
ſales therof, ſaieng yt they wer litle or nothing worth. Of al
this ye Captain general was informed,deuiſes of the Mores to entiſe thē aland. & for y• as he thought
the king knew nothing of all theſe things, neither yet what
diſcurteſie the Catuall had offered him, & for that he ſhould
vnderſtand the cauſe why the Captaine Generall did not
returne a land, neither yet wold ſend any more merchandiſe,
he did therfore ſend him word within fiue dayes after
hy his Factour of all that they hadde done vnto him,
and alſo what iniurye the Moores hadde ſhewed him,

touching their Merchants, promiſing notwithſtanding, that
he would not let to be at his commaundement with all the
whole Fléet. Then the king ſeemed to be very greatly offended
for that which they had done to ye Captaine general, inſomuch
as he had ſent him vnto his ſhippes. But for all
that the Catuall went vnpuniſhed, although he ſent the
Captaine Generall worde, that he would puniſh thoſe that
had ſo vſed him, which out of doubt were naughtie chriſtians,
ſo that it did well appeare that it grieued him verye
much to heare thereof. And as touching the Merchaundiſe
he promiſed to ſende thether ſuch as ſhoulde buye the
ſame, as hée did indéede ſeauen or eyght Merchauntes, which
are Gentiles Guſarates, and with his Factour hée ſent a
Nayre, which was a principall honeſt man, to the intent
hée might remaine in the Factorye with the Factour, to
whome hée gaue commaundement diligentlye to beware
that there ſhoulde not come any Moores to kill him.
               But for becauſe that this was done but vnder couloure
that the Moores ſhoulde not ſéeme to ſubborne the Merchauntes,
they bought nothing, but rather did abate the
price, of the which the Moores were verye gladde, and ſaid,
that nowe it did well appeare that they were not alone
that woulde not buye of theyr Merchaundiſe, yet for all that
ther durſt come no Moore to the Factorie, they once hauing
notice that there was placed a Nayre by the kinges commaundement.
And if ſo be that before they did not abide or
loue vs, they ten times worſe loued vs afterwarde, ſo that
whenſoeuer any of our men ſhould come a land, they receiued
the ſame as an iniurie done vnto them, ſpitting on the
ground, ſaieng: Portingale, Portingale. But our men which
vnderſtoode their meaning did laugh thereat, to the ende
thereby they might ſée howe little they did eſtéeme their
doinges, for ſo the Captaine Generall commaunded them
to doe. Nowe perceiuing that there was none that would
buy of the Merchants, he ſuppoſed the cauſe to be for that
they lay in a place where there were no Merchaunts.
               And therfore ſuppoſing that if ſo be that they were in Calicut,
                  
where other Merchants are, he ſhould ſell the better, did
therfore 
                     ••
                  ue ye King of Calicut by a meſſenger for licenſe
to ſend the ſame,Their merchandize paide for by ye king him ſelfe which he gaue immediately, and commanded
the Catuall to ſée the ſame brought forthwith, & to ſuch
as ſhould carrie them, to ſée them paid at his owne coſtes
and charges, for that he would not that any thing of ye king
of Portingales, ſhuld be at any charges in his Country, and
ſo it was done: but for all this the Captaine generall wold
neuer come more a lande, for that which the Catuall hadde
done vnto him, and for that Bontaybo which came to ſée
him manye times, did giue him counſaile ſo to doe, for that
the King was moueable, and therefore it was poſſible that
the Moores would alter his minde, for the great credite that
they were of with him. But the Captaine general was very
warie, and becauſe that he was a Moore,Bontaybo vſed, but not truſted. he would not
much truſt him, neither yet woulde giue him account what
he was minded to doe: yet for that he would ſéeme to haue
him in ſome reputation that he ſhould bring him alwayes
newes of that which did paſſe on ſhoare, he departed with
him both money and other rewards.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall being deſirous to retourne
toward Portingale, ſent to demaunde lycenſe
of the King to haue a Factor and a Scriuener,
with ſuch Merchaunts as he thought good:
& how the King cauſed the meſſenger with one
other, that was found a ſhoare to be craried to
priſon. Chap. 22.
               
                  THe Merchaunts being brought to Calicut,
the Captaine generall therewith gaue all
his men licenſe to goe and ſée the Citie of
Calycut, & to buye ther what they thought
good, ſo that there went out of each ſhippe
euery day a man, and thoſe being returned,
there went immediately others. And as they went on this

order, they were carried to the Gentiles houſes wher they
had good chéere, and alſo when occaſion ſerued might haue
among them good lodging. The like courteſie they did receiue
in Calicut, beſides they did report vnto our men of all
ſuch things as they had, and after the ſelfe ſame manner,
our men did beſtow amongſt them part of that they caried,
which were bracelets of Braſſe & of Copper, Pewter, and
apparell, which they carried to ſell in Calicut, or anye other
place, where they might goe as quiet as in Liſhborne.
From the lande there went aboord both Fiſher men & Gentiles
to ſell their Fiſh, Co
                        •
                     os and Hennes, which they gaue
in trucke of biſket and for ready money. Others ther wer
that went thether with their children, who carried nothing
with them to ſell, but only their going was to ſée our ſhips.
The Captaine generall was very glad of their comming, &
commanded to giue them meate: this he did for to increaſe
the friendſhip betwéene the King of Calicut & them. After
this order, the ſhips wer neuer without ſome, & thoſe yt wer
there, remained till ſuch time that night drew on, and then
they were bid to goe their waye. After this ſort they ſpent
their time till it was the x. day of Auguſt, the which was
the beginning of the ſeaſon wherin they might depart from
the Coaſt of the Indias,
                  The ende of ye vvinter in the Indias. and alſo for that as then their winter
did make an end. The Captaine generall perceiuing the
quietneſſe of the people and Countrey, and the familyaritie
they vſed with our men, and how quietly they went in Calicut,
without receiuing either hurt of the Moores or of the
Nayres, did credibly beléeue that this came to paſſe, for that
the King of Calycut would haue peace and friendſhip with
the King his Maſter, was the occaſion that almoſt in thrée
moneths that our men had trade in Calycut they did receiue
no manner hurt, either of the Moores or of the Nayres. Hée
did therfore determine to eſtabliſh the Factorie which was
there, with all ſuch Merchandize as he had lefte at that preſent
(although the leaſt parte thereof was ſolde) for that
there was now layde a good foundation or ground worke,
for the next voyage when it ſhuld pleaſe the King his Maſter

to ſende againe, and if it might pleaſe God to giue him
life, that he might bring him newes of this Diſcouerie, ſo
that it ſhould not be néedfull to make any new conſent or agréement
for the Factorie. And by the counſaile of his Captaines
and of the other Principalls of his ſhips, he ſent vnto
the King of Calicut a preſent, of ſkarfes of ſundry coulours,
of ſilkes, Coralls and other things, which was caried
vnto him by Diego Dias, deſiring the King to pardon him,
for that he was ſo bold as to ſend him that preſent, conſidedering
he did the ſame for no other purpoſe, but onelye to
ſhew what ſeruitour he was of his, who is and will bée alwayes
at his commandement, which was the occaſion that
he ſent it, and not for that he thought that things of ſo ſmal
valew, were of ſufficient dignitie, for to repreſent a King
withall of ſo great a power as he was. And if ſo be that he
had in his cuſtodie, that which he might eſtéeme or think to
be of a more worthie price, he would ſende it with a better
good will. And for that the time now drew néere ye he determined
to depart, he ordained for the ſame, and alſo if ſo bée
that he did minde to ſend any Embaſſadour to the King his
Maſter to confirme the amitie or friendſhip betwéen them,
he deſired him to commaund him to be in a readineſſe, for
that he had a confidence that as touching that which he had
agréed vpon with his highneſſe, as alſo preſuming on ye gifts
which he had receiued at his hands, yt he might as he was
deſirous, leaue in Calicut that Factor with his Scriuenor &
the Merchandize which he had left, not onely for a witnes of
a perpetuall peace & friendſhip ſetled ther with his highnes,
but alſo for a teſtimony of the truth of his Embaſſage, & of
that which ye King his Maſter ſhuld ſend héerafter, as ſoone
as he had news of him, & alſo for confirmatiō of his diſcouery
& to get ſome credit in Portingale, he did therfore ſend to
kiſſe his hands, requeſting him to ſend to ye king his maſter
one Bahar of cinamon, & another of cloues, & another of ſome
other ſpices, & as ſoone as ye factor did make any redy mony
of his wares, he ſhuld pay for ye ſame, forſomuch as at y• preſent
he had not wherewith to paye. After that Diego Dias
                  
had receiued his meſſage, there paſt foure dayes afore the
King would conſent that he ſhould come in his preſence, although
that he went euery day vnto his Pallaice. After that
he had commanded him to come into his preſence, he viewed
how and after what ſort he came laden, and therevpon
aſked him with a frowning countenaunce, what it was that
he would haue: but Diego Dias at that time was afearde,
that he would commaund him to be killed. But after that
he had told him his meſſage and would haue deliuered him
the preſent, he would not ſée it, but commaunded it to be deliuered
to his Factor. The aunſwere that he gaue touching
the Captaine generall was, that ſince he would néedes goe
his waye,The kings aunſvvere vnto Diego Dias. he might ſo doe: but firſt or that he doe depart, he
muſt giue him 600. Seraſynes, for ſo it was the cuſtome of
the Countrey. Diego Dias being returned with this preſent,
was accompanied by manye Nayres, which he ſéeing,
thought it to be for the beſt: but as ſoone as he was come
to the Factorie,Diego Dias kept in priſon, they remained at the dore, and woulde not
conſent, that he or any other ſhoulde come forth. And after
this proclamation was made in all the Citie, that vpon pain
of death there ſhould goe aboord our Fléete no boate or Almadias:
but yet notwithſtanding all this Bontaybo went,
and gaue warning to the Captaine generall in ſecrete, not to
goe a lande, nor conſent that any of his ſhould goe: for that
he knew for moſt certaine by the Moores, that if ſo be that
he or they ſhoulde ſo doe, the King would commaunde theyr
heads to be ſtroken off. And as touching all his faire words
and good entertainment, which he had ſhewed him vnto that
preſent, as alſo to giue him a houſe in the which his Merchandize
might be layd, as alſo the good entertainment that
our men had, was but méere diſſimulation, and to the ende,
he might haue taken him a lande with them, & ſo haue commaunded
them all to be killed, which was wrought by the
induſtrie of the Moores onely, which had made the King beléeue,
that they were théeues and went a rouing, and that
he came not vnto his Harbour, but to ſteale ſuch Merchandize
as ſhould be brought to the Citie, and alſo to eſpie the

Countrey, and after to come with a great Fléete for to inuade
the ſame. In the ſelfe ſame order was the Captaine
generall informed by two Malabars, which are Gentiles, being
therefore now in a ſtudie what was beſt to be done, hauing
this aduertiſement for moſt certaine, as ſoone as it was
night, there came aboorde the Generalls ſhip, a ſlaue of the
colour blacke, which was naturally borne in Guynee, & belonged
vnto Diego Dias and alſo was a Chriſtian, and had
the Portingall tongue very well, who tolde him that Diego
Dias and Aluoro de Braga did remain in priſon, & what
aunſwere the King of Calycut had made to his meſſage, &
what he had commaunded to be done with his preſent, and
alſo what Proclamations there were made: Diego Dias,
for that he thought good to giue him knowledge of yt which
had paſt, had bribed a Fiſher man to carrie this meſſenger,
and that in the night ſeaſon that he might not be knowen.
After that the Captaine generall had heard all this, he was
much offended therewith: howbeit, for that hée woulde ſée
the end thereof, would not depart, but did let paſſe that day,
to ſée whether that any would come aboord him. The nexte
day which was Wedneſdaye,Boies ſent for ſpyes being the xv. of Auguſt, there
came one onlyPinnace or Almadia aboord the General, in
the which were foure boyes, which brought fine precious
ſtones to ſell, and for that they came after ſuch ſort he tooke
them to be ſpies, and that their comming was for no other
purpoſe but to ſée what they did: and by this meanes hée
thought he might vnderſtand in what reputation they were
with the King. This was the occaſion the Captaine
generall did receiue them with as good a countenaunce as
he did before, giuing them nothing to vnderſtand yt he knew
of the impriſonment of Diego Dias, and wold not therefore
laye hand vpon thoſe, but vpon ſuch as ſhoulde come afterward
(which as he thought ſhould be of more credite) vntill
ſuch time as he had recouered thoſe that were impriſoned.
               Vnto thoſe alſo he wrote a Letter by thoſe Boyes,
with fained words, ſaieng that he did vnderſtande of theyr
impriſonment: this was done in ſuch order, that if ſo be this

letter ſhould haue come to any other mens hands, they could
not haue vnderſtood the ſame. Theſe Boyes did deliuer vnto
him this letter, who afterward told the king what great
entertainment they had at the Captaine generalls hands,
which made him to beléeue that he knewe nothing of the
impriſonment of his men, whereof he was very glad & did
retourne and ſend aboord others, and thoſe that ſhoulde goe
had warning giuen them not to diſcloſe,The king of Calicuts treſon towards the Captaine generall. that the Factour
with the others did remaine priſoners. This was done by
pollicie, for that he made this reckoning to deceiue the Captaine
generall on this ſort, vntill ſuch time that he was able
to ſende a Fléete of ſhips vpon him, or til that the ſhips
of Meca, ſhould come and take him. On this ſort went the
Malabars aboord, vnto whom the Captaine generall made
a good countenaunce, and commaunded them to be entertained
very well: all this he did for yt he ſaw none worth
the ſtaieng. On the Sunday next, there came ſixe principal
Malabars, with other fiftéene which waited vpon them, in
another Pinace. And for that the Captain generall thought
that for thoſe the King would ſend him his Factor and his
Scriuenour, he laid hands vpon them all, onely he lefte two
Mariners in a pinace, by whom he ſent a letter to the kings
Factors,Certaine Malabars ſtayed in exchange written in the Malabars tongue, in the which he demaunded
for the Factor and his Scriuenor, & then he wold
ſend thoſe which he had ſtaid. The kings factor hauing peruſed
this letter, he enformed ye king of y• which had paſt, who
cōmaunded, the Factor & Scriuenor to be brought home to
his houſe as priſoners, that he might from thence ſend for
them, and to diſſemble therewith as though he knewe nothing
of their impriſonment, & ſo cauſe them to be ſent from
thence to the Captaine generall, for that he might ſend him
thoſe Malabars which he had detained, whoſe wiues made
exclamation for the impriſonment of their huſbands. And
therefore the King was the more willinger to ſet our men
at libertie, who afterward remained a while in the Kings
Factors houſe.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall ſeeing the delayes wer made
for that the Factor with the Scriuenor came not, did bring
himſelfe in a readines as though he would depart immediately,
wherevpon without any further delay, the King
ſent them away, and what els happened. Chap. 23.
               
                  
                  THe captain general ſéeing yt they came not,
determined to proue whether yt with ſhewing
himſelf as though he wold depart immediatly,
they wold thē ſend them to him,
did therfore on wedneſday, being the xxiii.
of Auguſt commaund to wey his Ankor, &
to bring himſelfe vnder ſaile. And for that the winde was
contrary he was driuen to come to an Ankor foure leagues
from Calicut, riding in an open road, and there they remained
till the next Saterday, to ſée whether they would ſende
their priſoners. And perceiuing no likelihood thereof, he went
yet further into the Sea, ſo far, that he ſcarcely could deſcry
any land, & being at an Ankor for lack of winde, there came
thether a boat wt certain Malabars, which told ye Captaine
generall yt their comming was to ſéeke him out, & to tel him
y• 
                  Diego Dias with ye others, wer in ye kings pallaice, whom
he minded to ſend aboord,Yet 
                        〈◊〉
                      deuices to ſlaye the Portingals from departing which thing to be true they would
bind thēſelues yt as ye next day they ſhould be brought. And
ye cauſe why they brought thē not as then, was for that they
thought they ſhuld not ouertake him. Now for yt they ſawe
not yt 
                  Malabars yt the Generall kept as priſoners, thought yt
they were all dead. This craftie dealing was for no other
purpoſe, but to dally with ye Captaine general, & to ſtay him
with thoſe words, that the King might in the meane while
prepare in Calicut an armie of ſhips to ſet vpon him and to
tarry for the ſhips of Meca, to ioyne with his Fléete. After
this the Captaine generall commaunded thoſe of the towne,
to goe their way and not to retourne without his men, or
els their letters, for if ſo be they did he would ſink them wt 
his ordinance. And alſo if immediately they did not returne
with an anſwere, yt then he would cut off the heads of thoſe
which he had taken. With this aunſwere, thoſe of the

towne did departe, and immediatelye as ſoone as they had
winde, he made ſayle, and bearing along the Coaſt, came
to Ankor at the Sunne ſet ouer againſt Calycut.
               
               The next daye our men deſcryed comming ſeauen Almadias,
which came aboord the Captaine generalls ſhip, in the
one whereof came Diego Dias and Aluoro de Braga, and
in the others there came many others of the countrey, howbeit,
there were none that durſt enter within their ſhips,
but did put Diego Dias and Aluoro de Braga in his owne
boate which they had at their ſtearne, and afterwarde they
themſelues fell further off, tarrieng for the Captaine Generalls
aunſwere. To whom Diego Dias ſaid, That as ſoone
as the King of Calicut knew that he was gone, he ſent for
him from his Factors houſe and ſhewed himſelfe ioyfull, as
one that knew nothing of his impriſonment, and aſked him
what was the occaſion that the Captaine Generall tooke
thoſe men which he doth kéepe as priſoners, who afterward
tolde him the cauſe: wherevpon the King made aunſwere,
that it was well done. He aſked him alſo whether that his
Factor had demaunded at his hands any thing of gift, ſpeaking
againſt his owne Factor which was there preſent, for
that he knew wel inough yt it was not long ago, ſince he cō
                  maunded
one other to be killed, for taking certain bribes of
Merchaunt ſcraungers. After all this, he willed him to tell
the Captaine generall that he ſhould ſend him ye ſtone which
he promiſed him to be ſet in the Countrey, vpon the which
there is a Croſſe and the royall Armes of Portingale, and
alſo to know of him whether he be content to leaue Diego
Dias for Factor in Calicut, and with the ſame he ſent him a
letter for the King of Portingale, which was confirmed
and ſigned by the King, and written by Diego Dias and
with this Letter, he ſent Aluoro de Braga. The Captaine
generall tooke this Letter, which was written in a
certaine Leafe of a Palme Trée, vpon the which they doe
vſe to write matters, that ſhall indure a long time, the effect
whereof was this.
               
                  
                  Vaſco de la Gama, a Gentleman of thy houſe came to
my Countrie,The effect of ye king of Calicuts letters. of whoſe comming I was very glad. In my
Countrie there is great ſtore of Cinamon, Cloaues, and
Pepper, and precious ſtones. That which I am deſirous to
haue out of thy Countrie, is Siluer, Gold, Corall, & Skarlet.
The Captaine Generall for that he ſawe the king to
vſe no truth, woulde not aunſwere for all his offers, but
therewith ſent him all ſuch as he hadde ſtayed that were
Nayres, and for all the others, he ſent him word, he would
not ſend them, vntill ſuch time that he ſent him all ſuch
merchaundiſe as he had taken of his. Notwithſtanding hée
ſent him the ſtone he ſent for, & with this anſwere departed
thoſe that brought Diego Dyas aboord. The next day
there came a boord Bontaybo who tolde the Captaine Generall
that he came ſo ſodeinly away from Calicut for that
the Catuall by the kings commaundement had taken from
him all that he euer had, ſaieng that he was a chriſtian, and
that his comming to Calicut ouer land was by the king of
Portingales commaundement onely to bée his ſpie. Other
matters there were which he told him of, and that the ſame
came by the Moores procurement, the which he knew wel,
that as they tooke his goods, ſo they meant to do him ſome
ſhrewd turne in his perſon, if ſo bée that they coulde haue
taken him, and therefore he came his way before. The Captaine
Generall was very glad of his comming, and tolde
him that hée would carry him to Portingale, and that there
he ſhuld recouer all his goods with the double,Bontaibo vvilling to goe to Portingal beſides other
rewards that the king his Maiſter would giue him.
He commaunded alſo that in his ſhip there ſhould be prepared
him a principall good cabine. After this about tenne
of the clocke, there came a boorde the Captaine Generall
thrée Pinnaces laden with men, and vpon certeine of their
ſeates or benches, there was layd certeine Skarfs, as who
ſhould ſay, there came part of theyr Merchaundiſe. And after
theſe there came other foure one after another. And as
touching thoſe thrée that brought thoſe Skarfes, they tolde
the Captaine Generall that there came all theyr Merchandiſe

which they would put in his boate, and therefore they
willed him to bring thether thoſe Malabars which he had
priſoners, and that there they woulde fetch them. The
Captaine Generall perceiuing that this was but a fetche,
did will them to goe their waye, for that hée woulde haue
none of theyr Merchaundiſe but thoſe Malabars to carrye
to Portingale, as witneſſes of his diſcouerie.
               And if ſo be that God of his diuine goodneſſe doe giue
him lyfe, hée woulde very ſhortly retourne to Calicut, and
then they ſhoulde well knowe whether that thoſe Chriſtians
were théeues or not, as the Moores hadde made the
king of Calycut beléeue, and therefore that was the cauſe
why hée did them ſo manifeſt wrong. This béeing done
hée commaunded to ſhoote of many péeces of Ordinaunce,
with the feare thereof they ranne theyr waye.
               And if ſo hée that the kings ſhippes had bene in a readyneſſe
and a floate, they had ſent them againſt the Captanie
Generall, but they were haled vp for becauſe of the
Winter, which was to bée beléeued to haue béene the handye
worke of GOD, that our Shippes ſhoulde bée there at
this ſeaſon, for that they might eſcape and carrye newes
of the diſcouerye of this Countrye, to reſtore in the ſame
the holye Catholike Faith, otherwiſe if it had ben Summer
he woulde haue hadde his Fléete in a readineſſe, the which
was great, and ſo haue taken vs all, and by this meanes
there hadde bene none lefte to haue carryed newes to Portingale.
               
            
            
               Of the departure of the Captaine Generall
from Calycut towarde Portingale, and
what further happened vnto him being
in the Iland Anſandina. Cap. 22.
               
                  
                  ALthough that the Captaine Generall reioyſed
very much for that hée had diſcouered
Calicut, yet he was not fully ſatiſfied
therwith altogether, for that the king had
conceiued againſt him great diſpleaſure, &
by this meanes as he iudged the next fléet
that the king his maiſter, ſhould ſend, would run in great
daunger. Howbeit perceiuing that it lay not in his power to
do any more, he was therfore contented onely with the diſcouery,
and to haue knowne the Indias, & of their nauigation,
& what was commodious for the Countrie, and to haue
brought with him from thence examples of the ſpices, drugs,
and precious ſtones, as alſo of all other thinges that were
within the ſame citie. And hauing there no more to doe, he
departed, carrieng with him thoſe Malabars which he had
taken, for that by them he hoped to haue ſome agréement
made with the king of Calicut at the returne of anye other
Fléet. The Thurſday after his departure, being in ralme a
league of from Calicut, there came towarde him to ye number
of lx. Tonys full of Souldiers, by the which the king of
Calicut thought to haue taken them, who ſéeing them comming
commaunded his ordinaunce to be ſhot of at them, &
that oftentimes, and if he had not done ſo, they would haue
put him in greate daunger for that they followed him
an houre and a halfe. And by reaſon of a ſhowre of
raine which came vpon a ſodeine, the Captaine Generall
was driuen a ſea boord with all his Fléete, & in the meane
while the enimies fledde their waye, and bearing his
courſe towards Mylinde in great calmes, & that along the
coaſt, thought good & conuenient although ye king of Calicut
had abuſed him ſundry waies, that for the neceſſitie y• thoſe
that ſhould returne to Calicut, ſhould haue of his friendſhip
and fauour to receiue from thence theyr lading of Spices,
to vſe as it were ſome friendſhip with them, ſince that the
king would be gladde thereof, in eſpeciall being exalted,
did therefore write vnto him a letter in the Arabian
                  
tongue, which was penned in that language by Bontaybo,
in the which he did craue pardon for the carrieng awaye of
thoſe Malabars with him, which was done for no other intent
then that they ſhoulde be as witneſſes of that the
which he had diſcouered, as before hée had ſent him worde.
And for that he lefte no Factorie in Calycut (the which he
was ſorrie for) was for feare leaſt that the Moores ſhoulde
kill him, which was alſo the occaſion that he was not often
times a land. Yet for all that he did not leaue, but
woulde bée alwayes at his commaundement, ſince that
the king, his Maiſter would be gladde of his friendſhippe,
and alſo foorthwith woulde ſende him in his Fléete
greate abundaunce of all ſuch merchaundiſe as he doth demaund
for, by the trade, that from hence forth hée ſhoulde
haue with the Portingales in his Citie, would redound vnto
him great profit. This letter was deliuered vnto one of
the Malabars to carry the ſame a land to the place where it
was cōmāded to be deliuered. And afterward he knew yt the
ſame was deliuered to ye king of Calicut. Then ye Captaine
general going forward in his courſe, & that along the coaſt,
on the next Thurſday after, he fell amongſt certeine rocks,
with all his Fléete, and from one of them that was inhabited
there came forth ſundry Pinnaces with men, within
the ſame to ſell them Fiſh, and other victualls. The Captaine
Generall did receiue them very curteouſly, who commaunded
to giue them both ſhirts and other things, of the
which they were verye gladde, wherevpon he tooke occaſion
to aſke them whether they woulde be content that there
ſhoulde be erected a marke with a croſſe in the ſame, with
the royall armes of Portingale, in token that the Portingals
are theyr friends. And they aunſwered that they were contented,
and thereby they well knew that we were chriſtians,
and ſo was the marke placed, and ſince that time it is
called El Padron de Sancta Maria. Now to this day by the
foreſaid name the rocke is called. From hence as ſoone as
the night drew on and that the winde began to blow of the
ſhoare, the Captaine Generall made ſaile, and kéeping alwayes

along the coaſte on the Thurſdaie after, béeing the
19. of September hée fell with a goodly high lande, and
harde to the ſame there laye ſixe little Ilandes, and there
he came to an Ankor, and going a lande to take in water
did there finde a young man, which did demaund, concerning
the Captaine Generall, whether he were a Moore or a
Chriſtian, they aunſwered him that hée was a chriſtian.
This he did as it was thought with feare, leaſt that they
ſhould haue killed him, forſomuch as in that place there
were no chriſtians. This young man did carrie our men
within a certeine riuer, & ſhewed them moſt excellent water
the which iſſued out betwéene certeine rocks, and ſo: his
paines they gaue him a red night cap. The next morning
following there came from the land foure others in a ſmall
boate a boord the Captaine Generall, which brought with
them to ſell many gourds and Cowcombers, and they wer
demaunded by the Generall whether there were in that
Countrie any Cinamon or Pepper. They aunſwered that
there was nothing but Cinamon, and for that he was deſirous
to ſée the ſame,Cinamon grovving. he ſent with them two of his men, the
which at their return brought wt them two gréene boughs
of certeine trées which they doe take to be the ſame, reporting
that thereof, there was a great groue, howbeit the ſame
was wilde. And at their retourne there came with them
more then 20. of that Countrie men, which brought to ſell
hens, gourds, & Cowes milke. Alſo they requeſted the Captaine
Generall to ſend with them certeine of his men, for
that ſhortly after, they ſhould retourne with greate ſtore of
drie Cinamon, Hogges, and Hennes, but for all their great
offers, he would let none of his men goe, for that hée feared
leaſt the ſame was ſome treaſon. The next daye after
before dinner, our men going a lande to cut woode ſomewhat
farre of, from the place where they were, fell on a
ſoddeine vppon two Boates, the which laye harde by the
ſhoare ſide.
               The Captaine Generall woulde not immediatlye procure
to knowe what they were, till it was after Dinner,

for then he thought to know the ſame. And being in a redineſſe
to depart, did firſt commaund one of his Marriners
to go vp to the top, to ſée whether that he could diſcry any
other veſſels a ſea boord or not, who being there tolde him
that he had ſight of eight great ſhips which wer incalmed,
with this newes he left his going to ſée the others, & put
himſelfe in a readineſſe, the winde was in ſuch ſort that it
might ſerue them both, & as they came within two leagues
of our Fléete, the Captaine Generall made toward them.
The enimies perceiuing that, did immediatly flye toward
the ſhoare▪ And they bearing after this ſorte, was broken
the Rudder of one of the ſame, by reaſon whereof thoſe
that were within the ſhip were forced to go in their boats
toward the lande. Nicholas Coello who was next to this
ſhip, went immediatly and layde the ſame aboord, thinking
indéede to finde in it ſome greate ſhore of riches, howbeit
there was nothing els but Cocos and Melaſus, which is a
certeine kinde of Sugar made of Palmes or Date trées.
Alſo he founde therein manye bowes, arrowes, ſwoordes,
ſpeares and targats, and the other ſeauen ranne themſelues
a ground, and for that our men could not come néere vnto
them with their ſhips, they followed them in their boats,
and from thence did beate them with their ordinaunce, ſo
that their enimyes were driuen to leaue their ſhippes, and
béeing yet the next day at an Ankor, there came vnto him
ſeauen men of the country in an Almadias, who tolde him
that thoſe eight ſhips were of Calicut, the which the king
had ſent for to take him, as by thoſe that fled away they
vnderſtood.
            
            
               How the Captaine Generall went to Anſandina to take
in water, & alſo how he toke there a Moore
priſoner, which was ſeruant to the Lord of
the Iland of Goa called Sabayo, the which was
taken for a ſpie. cap. 25.
               
                  
                  AFter that the Captaine Generall
was thus informed, he would tarrie
there no longer, but immediatlye
came to an Ankor at the Ilande
of Anſandina, the which was diſtaunt
from thence as it were
two Gunne ſhotte, where it was
tolde him, there was excellent
ſwéete water. This Iland is but little, and but a league
of from the firme land. There are in the ſame many woods,
and alſo two conduit heads, made of frée ſtone of excellent
ſweete water, the which are ſprings and do riſe ther, wherof
one is ſixe foote déepe. Alſo in the ſea about the ſayde Iland
is great ſtore of fiſh. Before that the Moores did vſe
to traficke to the Indias, the ſame was inhabited by Gentiles,Anſādina forſaken of the inhabitants
in the which there were goodly buildings, in eſpeciall
their Pagodes was a goodly thing. And after that the Moores
which came from the red ſea began to ſaile that way, they
reſorted thether alwayes to take in their water and wood,
and did ſo abuſe the inhabitants that they could not wel abide
the ſame, ſo that they left their dwellings ther, but before
their going away, they plucked downe almoſt all their
Pagods▪
                   ſo that they left nothing ſtanding but the verye
Chappell, the lyke they did to all other their buildings, yet
for all that theſe Gentiles that wer of the firme land, which
belong to the king of Narſingas, had to this Pagode ſuch
deuotion that from thence they would goe ſundry times to
make in the ſame their praiers vnto thrée black ſtones that
were lieng in the middeſt of the ſaid Chappell.
               The Iland is called Anſandina which in the Malabars
language is called the 
                     •
                  iue Ilandes, for that rounde
about the ſame there lye the other foure. The Captaine
Generall hauing come to an Ankor, ſent Nicholas
Coello with his companye to diſcouer the ſame,
who founde it according as afore is declared, and a
goodlye place or grounde, where they might newe

graue their ſhips. And for that the Captaine Generall had
a great courſe to run, and alſo for that he knew not when
to finde ſo conuenient a place, he conſulted with the other
Captaines to bring their ſhippes there a ground. The firſt
ſhip that they brought there a grounde,They repaire their ſhips. was the Shippe
the which they called Ber
                        ••
                     o. And whileſt they were thus
occupyed, there came many people to ſell them victualls.
At which time there came two ſmall Brickentines that
hadde out theyr Standerds, and Flagges in the toppes of
theyr Maſtes, and within them theyr Trumpettes and
Drumnies, wherevppon they came playeng, at theyr pleaſure.
In theſe Brickentines there came manye men, and
they all at the Oare, and along the ſhoare ſide there were
other fiue which came to ſuccour them if they ſhoulde haue
anye néede.
               The Captaine Generall after that hée hadde fight of
them, had warning giuen him by the Malabars to beware
of them, for that they were rouers, and vnder a couloure
of peace, did robbe all that they coulde take. And after
that hée was entered into his ſhippe, hée perceiued that hée
might haue taken them if ſo bée that hée woulde haue conſented
to lette them to come aboorde him, but hée woulde
not agrée to the ſame. And therefore as ſoone as they came
within Gunne ſhotte, commaunded all theyr Ordinaunce
to be ſhot at them from thoſe two ſhippes that were a
floate. They fearing this ſhotte, gaue out a lowde voice
crieng, Tambarane, Tambarane, for ſo they doe call God,
and with this often ſhooting they fledde theyr way.
               
                  Nicholas Coello béeing as then in his Boate, went after
them alwayes ſhooting his Ordinaunce, who purſued
them ſo farre that the Captaine Generall was driuen to
put vp his Flagge for a ſigne hée ſhoulde retourne, and ſo he
did.
               The next daye after the Captaine Generall with all
his men béeing a land, working vpon the ſhip called Berrio,
there came in two litle Paraos to the number of twelue men
of the Countrie, the which in their apparel ſéemed to bée of

ſome countenaunce,Sugar Canes grovving there. who brought for a preſent a bundell of
Sugar Canes, and immediately as ſoone as they had deliuered
the ſame, they aſked licenſe to goe aboord and to ſée the
ſhips, for that they neuer ſaw any before. The Captaine generall
was greatly offended with this their requeſt, for by
that he feared leaſt that they were ſpies: and whileſt they
were in this talke, there came thether other two Paraos,
with as many more men. Thoſe that came firſt, ſéeing that
the Captaine generall was ſomewhat growen in cholar, did
will thoſe that came afterward, not to come a lande but to
returne againe. The ſhip Berrio being made in a redineſſe,
& afterward that the Generalls ſhip was brought a ground
to be new rigged, and hauing a lande about hir, all the other
Captaines, there came a man in a little Parao, who ſéemed
to be of the age of fortie yeares, and not of that Countrey,
for that he had vpon him a Sabaco of fine Cotten, which
reached downe to his héeles, and about his head a toocke or
towell, which alſo couered part of his face, and at his gyrdell
a Faw
                     ••
                  in or Skeyne. And aſſoone as he leapt a lande,
he went immediately to imbrace the Captaine generall as
one that had ſéene him or knowen him before, and after the
ſelfe ſame ſort he vſed the other Captaines, telling them that
he was a Chriſtian, and borne in Italy, and that hée was
brought into that Countrey of a childe, and that his dwelling
was with a Noble man that was a Moore, called Sabayo
the which was Lord of a certaine Iland called Goa,
lieng about twelue leagues from thence, and had forty thouſand
horſemen within the ſayd Iland. And for that his habitation
was amongſt the Moores, he obſerued their lawe,
howbeit it was but for an outward ſhew, but inwardly in
his ſoule he was a Chriſtian: and being in Sabayos houſe
it was tolde him, that there was come by Sea to Calycut
certaine men in ſhips, whereof there was neuer ſéene ye like
in the Indias, and that there were none that vnderſtoode
their language, and alſo that their bodies were couered ouer
with cloathes. And when he had vnderſtanding of the
ſame, he immediatelye iudged them to be Frangnes, for ſo

they do call thoſe that are Chriſtians in that Countrey, and
for that he was deſirous to ſée them, had therefore aſked lycenſe
of Sabayo, ſaieng that if ſo be that he woulde not giue
him licenſe to goe and ſée them, that he knewe verye well
that he ſhould dye with very thought and anger: by reaſon
whereof he gaue him licenſe, by whome hée ſent them
word, that if ſo be that there were in his Countrey anye
thing yt they had néede of, they ſhuld haue the ſame, in eſpeciall
ſhippes and victualles. And moreouer, if they woulde
come and dwell in his Countrey, he would be very gladde
thereof, and would giue both them and theirs ſufficient lyuing,
with the which they ſhould liue very honourably.
               After that he had ended thus his talke, the Captaine generall
aſked him perticularly for the Countrey of Sabayo,
and other things: Wherevppon he requeſted of the Captaine
generall a chéefe for to ſende to a companion of his,
which remained in the firme Lande, for that it was agréed
betwéene them, that if ſo be that he were well entertained,
that he woulde ſende vnto him a token in ſigne thereof.
This kinde of dealing made the Captaine generall ſuſpect
him, notwithſtanding, he commaunded a chéefe to be giuen
him, and alſo two newe loaues, the which he ſent to
his companion as aforeſaide, and he remained alwayes
talking with the Captaine Generall: His talke was ſo
much, that ſome time hée diſcouered himſelfe to bée a
ſpye.
               
                  Paulo de la Gama, which noted the ſame, aſked of
certaine countrey men what hée was, and they vp and
tolde him, that he was a Rouer, and that he had laide aboorde
other Shippes, which had bene there brought a
grounde before that time. The Captaine Generall béeing
thereof informed, commaunded him to be carried aboorde
his ſhippe, which was then a grounde, and there he commaunded
him to bee well whipped to confeſſe, whether
that all or anye parte of the ſame was true that hée had
tolde him, and alſo what he meant by his comming thether,
and whether he were a Moore or a Chriſtian, who

aunſwered that he was a Chriſtian as he had ſaid before, al
the reſt he denied, & therefore the General ſought one other
more cruell torment then whipping, which was by hanging
of him vp by his members by a pulley, to hoiſt him vp and
downe: and by the great paine which he ſuffered there, he
requeſted to be let downe, for that as their he would tell
him the truth:A notable coūterfait diſcouered and being come downe, he declared that hée
was a ſpie, and was ſent thether, to diſcouer how manye
men the Captaine generall had, and what weapons, forſomuch
as he was ill beloued along all that Coaſt, becauſe
he was a Chriſtian.A kinde of boates ſo called And that there were manyr Atalayas
or Foyſts placed in euery Baye or Kricke to ſet vpon him:
howbeit they durſt not vntill ſuch time as there came thether
other fortie great Veſſells, which were a making in a
readineſſe for to ioyne with thoſe that are armed, and ſo to
ſet vpon him, and to take him: and therefore in the meane
ſpace he was ſent to knowe what he ſayd, he affirmed alſo,
that he knewe not certainelye, when thoſe fortie ſayle
woulde come. This much he declared after that he had receiued
thrée or foure torments: all the reſt they vnderſtood
by coniectures, forſomuch as he did not perticularlye declare
the ſame.
               The Captaine generall ſéeing that he would declare no
more, was contented with the aduice he had giuen him,
and commaunded him to priſon vnder the hatches, for to
carrie with him vnto Portingale: alſo to be cured verye
well, and to giue him ſome refreſhing of victualles. Afterward
he tolde him that he did not minde to kéepe him priſoner
to haue him as his Captiue, but to carie him vnto the
King his Maſter, to the ende he might tell him ſome newes
of the Indias, knowing verye well that he would rewarde
him. Now the Captaine generall hauing knowledge of the
comming of his enimies, would therefore tarrie no longer
then whileſt his ſhip was new dreſſing, the which was done
in ten dayes.
               At this inſtaunt the Captaine generall was offered for
the ſhippe, the which ſhippe he had taken of the eight, that

did ſet vpon him a thouſand Fanons, but he wold not take it,
ſaieng that he wold not ſell any thing yt was his enimies,
but commaunded the ſame to be burnt. The Captaine Generalls
ſhip being ready and the water being taken in, hée
immediately departed vpon the fifth daye of October, and going
a Sea boord, about a two hundred leagues from thaf Iland,
then the Moore which he caried with him as priſoner,
ſeeing there was no other remedie, ſaid, that now he would
tell him the truth how that indéede he did dwell with the
Sabayo, to whom word was brought that the Captain generall
went wandring vpon the Seas, as one that knewe
not where he was, and therefore there was in preparing a
great Fléete for to take him. The Sabayo hauing notice
thereof, commaunded him to goe thether to viſite him, and
to marke how they went, and alſo to ſée whether that hée
could bring them to Goa, which if ſo be that he could bring
to paſſe, he would as then laye hand vpon them, for that the
fame went that they were valyaunt, and ſo meant to kéepe
them to make warres againſt other Kings his next neighbours.
Theſe newes the Captaine Generall was glad to
heare of, and gaue him from thenceforth better entertainment,
& allowed him both apparell and alſo money, & afterward
he was made a Chriſtian, to whom he gaue for name
Gaſpar,
                  A Moore chriſtened in honour of one of the thrée Kings, called Magus
of that name, and for that the Captaine generall was his
God father, he gaue him the title of his ſurname, and ſo euer
after he was called Gaſpar de la Gamas.
               
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall went forwarde
on his Voyage towarde Mylynde, and of
the great troubles he paſt, vntill ſuch time
as he came thether. Chap. 26.
               
                  
                  FOllowing from hence his courſe
towards Mylynde, whether hee
was minded to returne to take in
there an Embaſſadour, he went
alwayes in cruell ſtormes, which
the Captaine generall continually
indured, vntil ſuch time he had entred
the goulfe, & hauing alwayes
the winde right againſt him, it
was the occaſion that the ſhippes
made but ſmall way, and therefore it was the longer time
before he entered the gulfe. But after that he was entered
within the ſame, he was again troubled with great calmes,
which on the Sea is very troubleſome, not only for the gouerning
of their ſhips, but alſo with the heat, which is more
hurtfull vpon the ſea, then vpon the land, for that ther is no
couering to defend the Sunne,Men ſtifled vvith the Sunne onely. whereon with the ſame only
men are ſtiffeled vp, as hath bene ſéene in the voyage toward
the Indias. And as I ſay the winde hauing courſing
thus with the heates, the ſpace of many dayes together, did
afterward returne and breake vp in contrary windes to go
forward, and very good to goe backward. But the Captaine
generall being loath to go backward, wold yet rather tarie
ther wher he was, as indéed he did. And when he perceiued
that the winde was ſo great and the Seas went ſo high,
that there was no tarrieng for him with his ſhippes, then
was he driuen of force to kéepe the Seas, ſometime on this
boord, and ſometime that; ſo that both he and his men paſſed
great troubles, by reaſon they all had inough to doe to
gouerne their ſhips. And hoping that after ſo great ſtormes
there would come faire weather, were driuen once more to
pray for thoſe great calmes which they had before. And
when they ſawe that this weather was like to endure many
dayes, and that their water beganne to fayle them, was
the occaſion that the Captaine Generall commaunded the
ſame to be deliuered by order.
               
                  
And going in this neceſſitie, and alſo with fowle weather,
the people began to fall ſicke a diſeaſe in their gums,
as they did in the riuer, De buenas Sennal
                        •
                     s, when as they
went to Calicut,
                  The Skurfe. & alſo their armes and legs did ſwell, beſides
other ſwellings which did riſe in their bodyes, by reaſon
of a peſtilent ſtinking humour, which did caſt them into
a laſke, and of this new infirmitie, there dyed to the number
of thirtie perſons. And after that they began once to die,
and had continued this kinde of weather vppon the Seas,
ther aroſe ſuch a feare amongſt thoſe that did remain aliue,
that they fared in the ſame, as it were men amazed, and beléeued
verely that they ſhould neuer goe from thence, for
that as they thought this kinde of weather was alwayes
durable there, and that the ſame was the cauſe that it indured
ſo long. The Maſters and Pilots of the Fléete were of
the lyke opinion, which made the reſt beléeue it the ſooner,
that by this meanes the crye of all thoſe that were there, as
well of them that were ſicke as of the other, was great,
ſaieng that ſince the weather would not ſerue them to goe
from thence, yet they requeſted him not to be an occaſion
of their death, but rather conſent to retourne vnto Calycut,
or els to ſome other place in the Indias, and béeing ther, to
receiue what God ſhuld appoint them, rather then to dye in
thoſe ſeas of to terrible diſeaſes, for which ther was no likelihoode
of any remedie, in eſpeciall hauing lacke of all other
things, as of victuals and water, which as then they began
to want, by reaſon that by their long continuaunce in the
ſaid place was all ſpent. The Captaine generall ſéeing the
great feare that his men were in, and for to animate them
the more, ſayd vnto them all on this ſorte, requeſting them
to be content, and not to beléeue that ſuch weather as was
there courſed by them on that ſorte, was alwayes lyke to
continue, for if ſo bée that it were ſo, then there woulde
be no Nauigation from the Goulph to the Strayghtes of
Meca, nor to Mylynde, nor yet from anye other place,
by the which they ſhoulde paſſe: And that it was not vnpoſſible,
but that they might ſomewhat digreſſe from

their right courſe, and therefore they met with theſe calmes
and windes which they indured, yet thoſe he ſaide ſhould
haue an ende, and with the ſame, their troubles will lykewiſe
ende.
               But for all this, the Marriners woulde not beléeue
him, for that in this trouble they had continued foure monethes,
and alſo that there were dead of theyr fellowes,
thirtie perſons: ſo that there were ſo fewe of them remayning,A vvofull mortalitie
that there was not to euery ſhip ſixtéene perſons left
to gouerne the ſame: and of them there were ſome, that
were verye ſicke of the diſeaſe aboue ſayde. By this
meanes they fell into ſuch a deſperation, by reaſon that
they thought they ſhoulde goe no further, and as they doe
affirme, that Paulo de la Gama, and Nicholas Coello, béeing
both of them Captaines made agréement each of them
in theyr Shippes to the other, that if ſo bée that there
woulde come anye Winde, by the which they might
retourne into the Indias, that then they woulde ſurelye
doe ſo.
               Béeing thus determined, vppon a ſodayne there
came a freſh gale of Winde, with the which the Fléete
might goe forwarde, and with the ſame in ſixteene dayes
they came within ſight of lande, béeing on a Wedneſday
the ſeconde of Februarye: at the which the Marriners reioyced
in ſuch ſort that by meanes of the ſame, they had
forgotten theyr troubles and daungers that they were
paſt, and gaue vnto God great thankes for all his gracious
benefites.
               And when that they hadde ſight of the Lande, they
founde themſelues ſo néere vnto it, that the Captaine generall
gaue commaundement to caſt about into the Sea,
ſo much as might bée thought ſufficient for to ſtaye vntill
the morning, the which béeing come, they went foorthwith
for to reknowledge the Lande, and for to ſée where
they were, for that as now there was none that knewe
the ſame, although that one of the Moores ſayde, that
they hadde then taken theyr Courſe directlye towardes

                  Monſanbique, which ſtandeth betwéene certaine Ilandes,
ſtanding ouer againſt them, thrée hundred leagues of the
ſhore, whereas the people of the ſame Countrey are continually
ſicke of the ſame diſeaſe, that our men were. The
morning being come he went to reknowledge the land, and
came before a goodly great Citie, which was walled round
about and within the ſame, very faire and high houſes, and
in the midſt of the ſame there was a great Pallaice, which
ſtood very high, and ſéemed to be of a goodly building, all this
they ſaw very well out of their ſhips. This Citie is called
Magadoxo,
                  The Citie of Magadoxo. which ſtandeth at the ende of the ſaid goulfe in
the Coaſt of Aethiopia, a hundred & thirtéene leagues from
Mylynde, the ſcituation whereof I ſhall declare héereafter.
And for that the Captaine generall knew the ſame to bée a
Citie of Moores, when as hée went along the Coaſt,
hée commaunded to ſhoote of manye péeces of Ordinaunce,
and alſo for that he coulde not tell how farre hée
was from Mylynde, from thence forward he ſtayed in the
night, becauſe he would not paſſe the ſame. Foorthwith, on
Saturday being the fifth of Februarie, lieng ouer againſt a
village of the Moores, which they call Pate, being a hundred
and thrée leagues from Magadoxo, there came from thence
eight Terradas which is a certaine kinde of Boates of that
Countrey, being all full of Souldiours, and made theyr
waye ſtraight towarde our Fléete, fromwhence we ſhot ſo
many péeces of Ordinaunce, that they thought themſelues
happy to haue eſcaped by running awaye. Howbeit our men
did not followe them for lacke of winde. The next Mundaye
following, the Generall arriued at Mylynde, and béeing
there, the King ſent to viſite the Captaine Generall
with ſundrye freſh victualls, ſending him word alſo, how
glad hée was of his comming. The Generall aunſwered
him againe, by Fernan Martines, by whome hée ſent
him a Preſent: and for becauſe of thoſe that were ſicke,
whome hée was deſirous to haue cured, hée tarryed
there fiue dayes, in the which time, there died of them
many.

At this preſent by the kings licenſe, he cauſed to be ſet a
land a marke, in token of friendſhip. And after that he had
prouided himſelfe of victuals, he departed on a wedneſday
in the morning, béeing the xvii. of Februarie, with an Embaſſadour
whome the king did ſende, to the king of Portingale,
for a perpetuall confirmation of friendſhippe betwéene
them.
            
            
               Of the death of the Captaine Generalls brother,
and of the burning of one of the ſhips called
Saint Raphael, & alſo how he arriued in Portingale,
and of the honour the king gaue him at
their meeting. cap. 27.
               
                  NOw for that the Captaine Generall had
not men inough to gouerne the whole
Fléete, he thought good and that by the aduiſe
of the other Captaines, to burne one
of thoſe ſhippes, and that the ſame ſhould
be Saint Raphael, which they determined
to doe the rather, forſomuch as the ſame was al open,
and they had not brought him a grounde as they did the
others, and alſo determined to burne the ſame vppon the
ſhoels of Saint Raphael,
                  The Raphaell burned. vnto which place they came on
the Sunday following, where (what for taking in of her
furniture, as alſo for burning the ſame) he ſpent fiue daies,
and during that time from a village the which is called
Tangata, there were brought to ſell many hens. This béeing
done the Captaine Generall departed, hauing with him
in his ſhippe his brother called Paulo de la Gama, and on
the .xx. of Februarie he found himſelfe with onely Nicholas
Coello in the Iland of Zenziber,
                  The Ile of Zenziber. which ſtandeth in the
altitude of ſixe degrées, lieng but ten leagues from the firme
land. This Iland is verye greate with the other two that
ſtandeth néere vnto it, whereof the one is called Pemba,
and the other Mofya, and are verye fertill, and haue in
them great ſtore of victualls. Their groues are of Orenge

trées, which bringeth forth goodly Orenges. They are inhabited
by Moores, which are but a weake kinde of people,
and they haue but ſmall ſtore of weapons, howbeit they
goe very well apparelled, in ſilke and fine cloath made of
Cotten, the which they doe buye in Mombaſſa, of Merchants
of Cambayo. The women haue ſtore of iewells
of golde from Sofala, and of ſiluer from the Iland of Saint
Larence. They are merchants & their trade is in the firme
land, and thether they do carry victuals to ſell in litle boats.
Each of theſe Ilands hath a king of himſelfe, the which alſo
doe obſerue Mahomets lawe as all the reſt of the ſubiectes
doe.
               As ſoone as the king of Zenziber hearde that the
Captaine Generall was there arriued, he ſent to viſit him
and ſent him great preſents of the fruits of the country, requeſting
him of his friendſhip, to the which he agréed. After
all this he departed on the firſt of March, and came to
an Ankor before the Ilands of Saint George in Monſanbique,
and the next day after he ſent a marke to be erected
within that Ilande, where at his going thether he heard
Maſſe, & without any conuerſation with thoſe of Monſanbique
he departed. And on the third of March he came to
the Iland of Saint Blaſe, where he ſtayed to take in his
water, and to victuall himſelfe of Sea woulfes, and of Solitarius,
which they ſalted to eate whileſt they were on the
ſea, and for the ſame they gaue God great thanks. After that
they were departed from thence (being once before putte
back with weſterly winds) which blew right againſt them,
God of his goodnes ſent them ſo proſperous a winde, that
on the twentith of March, they hadde doubled the
Cape of Buena Eſperansa with great pleaſure, forſomuch
as all thoſe that came thether were all in health and verie
ſtrong, and as they thought were all in good liking to arriue
at Liſhborne.
               
               And finding héere a colde Winde which endured well
twentye dayes, did ſet them in a good forwardneſſe towarde
the Ilande of Santiago, which by theyr Sea cardes

was by the Pilots we known not to bée at the vttermoſt
a hundred leagues from thence. Some there were that
thought themſelues to bée with the ſame, but it was not
ſo.
               Héere that goodly and fayre winde did faile them, and
forſomuch as the Captaine Generall would néedes knowe
where that he was, (for that hée coulde not tell) by reaſon
there fell certeine ſhowres which came from the landewarde,
he commaunded to make as much waye as they
coulde poſſible. And going after this ſorte, on Thurſdaye
being the xxv. of Aprill, he commaunded the Pilot to let
fall his Plommet, who founde that they were in xxv. fathome.
               Yet in all that daye, ſailing and kéeping the ſelfe
ſame courſe, the leaſt water that they came to, was at
xx. fathome, and therefore the Pilottes iudged themſelues
to bée vppon the ſhoels Del zio Grands. All the reſt of
this voyage perticularlye what aduentures the Captaine
Generall did paſſe, vntill ſuch time as he came to the Ilande
of Santiago, I coulde not come to the knowledge
thereof, but only how that as they went néere to the ſame,
Nicholas Coello to carry the king newes of this diſcouerie,
did on a certeine night a parte himſelfe from the Captaine
Generall, and followed his courſe vnto Portingale,
where hée arriued at a place called Caſcais on the x. of Iuly,
in the yeare of our Lorde God. 1499. who informed
the king of all that the Captaine Generall hadde paſt in
the diſcouery of the Indias, and of the commodytyes that
he had brought with him from thence. Of whoſe diſcouery
the king was ſo gladde to heare of, and that they might
trade into the Indias by ſea, as when he was proclaimed
king of the kingdomes of Portingale. Now after that the
Captaine Generall founde miſſing Nicholas Coello hée
went forwarde on his courſe towarde the Ilande of Santiago,
for becauſe his Brother was verye ſicke of a
Tyſſicke, and alſo for that his Shippe made but ſmall
waye, for that ſhée was all open, and therefore hée

did fraight there a Caruell which he found there for to carrye
him to Portingale before that he ſhould dye, who left
there Iohn de Sala for Captaine of his ſhip as I ſayd before,
who as ſoone as the ſhip was new rigged, had charge
to bring the ſame to Portingale, from the which place the
Generall departed, with his brother in the Caruell, whoſe
infirmitie did dayly increaſe, in ſuch ſort that the Captaine
Generall was driuen to beare with the Iland of the Terceras.
And béeing there arriued, commaunded that his brother
might be brought a lande, where he was ſo cruellye
handled with his diſeaſe that he dyed thereof, who at his
end ſhewed himſelfe to be a good and perfect chriſtian, and
a very honeſt Gentleman. After that he was dead and buried,
the Captaine Generall departed toward Portingale,
who came to Belen in the moneth of September, in the
ſelfe ſame yere. 1499. being two yere & two moneths paſt
after his departure frō 
                  Liſhborne, with 108. men & of them
came backe but fiftie aliue, which conſidering theyr great
trauaile and trouble that they had paſt, was verye much.
After that the Captaine Generall had giuen God greate
thanks for that he had eſcaped ſo many great daungers, he
ſent word of his arriuall vnto the king of Portigale, who
for the great pleaſure that he receiued of his comming ſent
Don Diego de la Silua de Meneſis, Lord of Portugalete,
with many other Gentlemen to receiue him as they did, &
brought him vnto ye court wt an excéeding great number of
people, that came thether to ſée ſo new & rare a matter, as
that was of ye Captaine General, not onely for that hée had
done, but alſo for that they tooke him for dead: béeing come
to the kings preſence, his highneſſe gaue him ſo great an
honour as ſuch a one deſerued, who by the diſcouerie of the
Indias, did giue ſo great a glorie vnto the eternall God,
and honour and profit to the crowne and kingdome of Portingale,
and a perpetuall fame to all the world. Afterward
he made him knight, & to him and to his heires for euer he
gaue for armes the royal armes of Portingal, & alſo to ſet
at the foote of the Scutchin two Does the which they call

                  Gamas. Alſo he gaue him towarde this his liuing thrée
hundred thouſand Ceis a yeare, the which may be worth of
our money 200. pound a yeare, and this to be paied out
of the tiths of the fiſh in the village of Sinis. Moreouer hée
promiſed him to make him Lord of the ſaid village, forſomuch
as he was borne there. And vntill ſuch time that he
could giue him ye ſame, he allowed him a thouſand crowns
a yeare, the which he did well perfourme, from that time
forwarde, and after that he had receiued the poſſeſſion therof,
he did paſſe it ouer vnto the houſe appointed, for the contraction
of the Indias. Moreouer he graunted him that after
the trade of the Indias was ſetteled or eſtabliſhed, that
then he might lade for his own account to the ſum of. 200.
Duckats in ſpices, & that without paieng for the ſame any
cuſtome at all. Alſo he gaue him other poſſeſſions & rents
and a bill of remembraunce to make him Lorde. As for
Nicholas Coello, he made him a Gentleman of his houſe,
and gaue him poſſeſſions, and did allowe him ſome recompence
toward his charges. The king himſelfe with this
new diſcouerie did increaſe his titles with a newe and a
famous ſtile, of Lorde of the conqueſt and nauigation of
Aethiopia, Arabia, Perſia, and of the Indias.
               
            
            
               How the king of Portingale did nominate A Pedro
al Verez Cabral for Captaine Generall of
a Fleete towarde Calicut, for to ſettle there a
factorie, and of his departure from Liſhborne.
Chap. 28.
               
                  BEing certainlye knowne to the king of
Portingale,
                  The preparation vnto ye ſecond voiage. that from his kingdome there
is a nauigation to the Indias, and alſo of
the innumerable riches, that there are in
thoſe parts among the Gentiles, ſundrye
Chriſtians, did therfore determine to proſecute
and followe the diſcouerye of the ſame, giuing all
praiſe and lande vnto the eternall God, for his great benefits

that he hath beſtowed vpon him, to let him be the firſt
that hath diſcouered this new worlde, the which hath alwayes
beene ſo cloſe vpon the Sea, that there hath béene
none in all Europe that durſt aduenture that waye.
But hée not remembring the trouble of his ſpirite, neyther
yet the ſpending of his treaſure, nor the daunger of
his ſubiects, woulde neuertheleſſe take this moſt famous
enterpriſe in hande, for that there might bée in the Indias
publyſhed the Euangelicall lawe, to the ende that thoſe
kinde of loſt people, might receiue the ſame, as alſo for
the increaſing, not onelye of his owne treaſure, but generallye
the benefite of all his ſubiects.
               And that the ſame might take the better effect, hée
determined to giue the attempt (if it were poſſible) to ſettle
a Factorye in Calycut by gentleneſſe, for as hée once
vnderſtoode that the dwellers in the ſame were inclined to
trade, he thought that after this ſort there wold grow betweene
them and vs conuerſation, and ſo a friendſhippe,
the which might bée an occaſion that they woulde incline
themſelues to heare the worde of God preached. And béeing
thus fullye determined, hée commaunded to bée in a
readineſſe againſt the next yeare following, a Fléete of ten
ſhippes and two Caruells, which ſhoulde goe well laden
with all ſuch thinges as Vaſco de la Gama ſhoulde informe
him to bée ſpent in Calycut. Alſo there went others
towarde Sofala and Quyloa, where alſo hée commaunded
certeine Factoryes to bée ſetteled, not onelye for the golde
which they haue there, but alſo that theyr ſhippes might
alwayes touch there. And concerning ſuch as ſhoulde bée
appointed for Calycut,
                  The names of the Generalls Captaines, & Factors. he named for Captaine Generall
of this Fléet, a Gentleman called Pedro Aluares Cabral,
who came of an honourable houſe of the Cabralls, and
for his pettie Captaine, a Gentleman called Sancho de
Toar. The names of the other Captaines as manye as I
knewe were theſe, Nicholas Coello, Don Luis continuo,
Simon de Myſeranda, Simon Leyton, Bartholome Dyas,
who diſcouered the Cape Bu
                        •
                     na Eſperanſa, Dyego Dyas,
                  
his brother, yt which went before for purſer with Vaſco de
la Gama. Thoſe that wer Captaines of ye Caruels were one
Pedro de Taide, and Vaſco de la Siluera, and for Factor of
the whole Fléete, was one Aries Correa, who lykewyſe
ſhould remaine for Factor in Calycut, and for his clarkes
there were appointed one named Gonſalo Gyl Barbasa, &
Pedro vas Caninon. Of this Fléete there ſhoulde remaine
and ſtaie with the Merchants and Merchaundiſe in Sofala
two ſhips, and with the ſame ſhoulde contineu for Factor
one called Loriſo Hurdato. In this Fléet ther went. 1500.
men. The Articles which the Captaine Generall carryed
in his inſtructions, beſides thoſe of the ſetling of the Factory
was, yt if ſo he yt the king of Calycut would not quietly
conſēt, or giue ſufficient lading, for thoſe ſhips which he caried
nor conſent to haue the factorie ſetled there: That then
he ſhould make him moſt cruell war, for the iniury which
he ſhewed vnto Vaſco de la Gama. And if ſo bée that the
Factorie might be quietly ſettled, then he ſhould requeſt
the king in ſecret that he doe not conſent in Calycut, or
in anye other of his harbours belonging to his kingdome,
any of the Moores of Meca to remaine ther, forſomuch as
hée would ſend him from hence forth all ſuch Merchaundiſe
as they doe bring, and that farre better cheap then they
doe ſell the ſame. Moreouer, that in theyr waye they doe
touch at Milinde to ſet ther a land the Embaſſador, which
Vaſco de la Gama brought from thence, and to ſende the
king a preſent. Alſo the king did ſend with the Fléete fiue
Friers of the order of Saint Fraunces, of whome went for
Vicar, a Frier called Fraij Henrique, the which was afterward
Biſhop of Siebta,
                  Friers ſent to the Malabars. and he to remaine in the Factorie,
to preach the Catholike faith vnto the Malabars.
               
               The Fléet beeing diſpatched, the king in perſon on Sunday
being the .viii. of March went to heare Maſſe at the Monaſterie
of Belem, going thether in Proceſſion, hauing the
Captaine Generall, the which heard Maſſe with him, within
the curten, for on that ſort, he ment to giue honour to ſuch
as did ſerue him in ſuch daungerous affaires as this was.
               
                  
The Maſſe was ſaid after the Portingale order, and at
the ſame there was a Sermon made by Don Diego Ortis,
who was then Biſhoppe of Vyſe
                        •
                     , who gaue great praiſe
vnto the Captaine Generall for accepting the ſaide voiage
at the kings hands, ſince that therby he did not onely ſerue
the king, who is his temporall Lord, but alſo the eternall
God, who is ſpirituall. And alſo that euery one might wel
know that none of all the nobles, the which are ſo highlye
commended as well in the Grecian hiſtories as in the Latine
and barbarous, was equall vnto the Captaine Generall
in taking vpon him this voyage. And further he gaue
him other greate prayſes for the which hée was enuyed
at, the Maſſe béeing ended, there was a Banner which had
the royall armes of Portingale, vpon the ſame deliuered vnto
the Biſhoppe, who after that hée had bleſſed the ſame,
the king with his owne hand did deliuer it vnto the Captaine
Generall, for to beſtowe it in his maine toppe. And
after that hée had receiued the ſame,A ievvell of great price. he tooke at the Biſhops
hands a bonnet or night cap the which the Pope had
bleſt, and ſent for a great iewell, and with his owne hands
did put the ſame on the Captaine Generalls head, ſayeng
that he did preſent vnto him a iewell the which he did
much eſtéeme. And afterward that the Biſhop had giuen
him his bleſſing, the king with the ſame did accompanie
him to the water ſide, where the Captaine generall with al
the Captaines of the fléete tooke their leaue of the king, and
did kiſſe his hands, and the king gaue them Gods bleſſing
& his, with the which they went all a boorde, from whence
they ſhot off all the ordinance that was in the Fléete, the
which made a wonderfull noiſe. The king béeing returned
to Liſhborne, for that the Fléete could not that daye depart,
by reaſon of the weather. The next daye which was
the ninth of March, in the yeare of our Lorde. 1500. hauing
a ſufficient good gale of winde, with the which the
Fléete might goe out of the Riuer. The Captaine Generall
did then make a ſigne that the reſt of the Fléete
ſhoulde weye their Ankors, the which immediatlye they

did begin with great diligence and triumph that the Marriners
made. And when it was eight of the clocke in y• morning
the whole Fléete hauing wayed, did then begin to cut
and ſpread their ſayles with a great pleaſure, and crie ſaieng
altogether, Buen viage, that is to ſay, A luckie and proſperous
voyage. After all this they beganne all to be ioyfull,
euery man to vſe his ſeuerall office, the Gouernour in the
midſt of the ſhip, haling the maine ſhéetes, with the Capſteine.
The Mariners and ſhip boyes, ſome in the forecaſtell
haling bollings, braces, and Martnets: other belying the
ſhéetes both great and ſmall, and alſo ſeruing in trimming
the ſayles, and others the nettings and foretop ſayles, other
ſome vering the truſſes and alſo beleying braſes and toppe
ſayles ſhéetes, and coyling euery ſort of ropes. It was wonderfull
to ſée ſuch a number of diuerſities of offices, in ſo
ſmall a roome, as is the bredth and length of a ſhip. All the
Fléete being vnder ſayle, departed that daye without anye
ſtay by a quarter winde, and béeing with the ſame vnder
ſayle, on the xiiij. of March, they came within the ſight of
the Canar
                        •
                     as, and on the xxij. of the ſame moneth, they paſt
by the Iland called Santiago, and on the xxiiii. of the ſame
moneth, they loſt the company of one of their ſhips, of the
which went for Captaine one Vaſco de Tayde, who was
Captaine of the Fléete alſo, although he neuer declared the
ſame, the which neuer after was ſeene.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall came vnto Braſill, and
afterward how there was loſt foure ſhips of the
Fleete. Chap. 29.
               
                  THis ſhip being thus gone, the Captaine generall
tarried for the ſame two dayes, and
on the xxiiii. of Aprill they did deſ
                     •
                  ry land,
of the which they were verye glad, not
only for that they had diſcouered the ſame,
but becauſe that the Pilots ſuppoſed the

ſame to be ſome other land, that Vaſco de la Gama had not
diſcouered, for that it ſtoode to the Eaſt, and immediatly the
Captaine Generall commaunded his Maſter to goe in his
ſmall boate and to ſée what kinde of people were thoſe that
dwolt in the ſayd Countrey, who retourned with an aunſwere,
ſaieng, that the ſame lande was a goodly fayre and
fertill Countrey, in the which there were great ſtore of
wordes, and that there walked many men along the water
ſides with this newes, the Captaine generall came to an
Ankor, & ſent once more his Maſter with great dilygence to
enforme himſelfe of the Countrey and of their dwellings,
and found that the people were of colour ſomewhat blacke,
and men well proportioned, howbeit they went all naked,
hauing both bowes and arrowes. But when night was
come, there fell ſo great a ſtorme that the Captaine generall
with all the reſt of the Fléete, were faine to wey theyr Ankors,
and runne along the Coaſt, vntill ſuch time as they
found a good Port, in the which they came to an Ankor, vnto
the which the Captaine generall did giue for name, Puerto
Seguro, forſomuch as the ſame ſerued for all wethers.
Héere our men tooke two men of that Countrry, the which
went in an 
                     〈◊〉
                   who were brought before the Captaine
generall, that he might informe himſelfe what Country
that was, which could not be known notwithſtanding,
forſomuch as there was none in all the fléete that could vnderſtand
them, by any tokens or ſignes. The Captaine general
ſéeing yt ther was no meanes for to informe himſelfe
by thē, cōmanding to giue them apparell, yt the others might
be deſirous to bring thē victuals to ſel, wt other things which
they had in their country, & with this they went their way,
wt great ioy of yt Captain generals gift. And when they wer
come a land amongſt their cōpanions, & they perceiued their
good entertainment, did aduenture to come to conferre with
our men. The Captaine general finding himſelf indifferently
in this country, did determine to take in freſh water to cō
                  fort
his men wtall, for yt he knew not when he ſhuld chance
wt like opportunitie. And for yt God might ye rather and thē,

he commanded on ye next day, which was on Eaſter wéeke,
a Maſſe ſhuld be ſaid a land, yt which was ſo done wt great
ſolemnitie & that vnder a pauillion, in which ther was made
a Sermon by Fraij Henrique, Doctor of Diuinitie. And
whileſt y• diuine ſeruice was a celebrating, there aſſembled
many of ye country people together, which ſhewed thēſelues
to be very merry wt plaieng & leaping which they made, beſides
their ſounding vpon cornets, horns, & other inſtrumēts.
After Maſſe was ended, & that ye Captaine generall was going
a ſhip boord, theſe people went wt him vntil he tooke his
boat, ſinging & making a thouſand manner of paſtimes: this
day after dinner, y• Captaine general gaue our men licenſe to
go a land to buy & ſell wt them, which they did, & in truck of
paper & cloth, they gaue them parrats, & other ſundry ſort of
birds, which were all very faire, whereof they haue great abundance,Ornamēts made of Parrats feathers.
with the which they make fethered hats & night
caps, which are very gallant. Some of our men yt went to
ſée their townes do declare ye the ſame is a goodly country &
fertill of woods, wt great ſtore of goodly waters, & plentie of
fruits, & that ther is gathered in ye ſame gret quantitie of cotten.The coū
                     trey of Braſil diſcouered
And for yt this country is yt which we cal Braſil, which
to all men is common, I will not ſpeake of y• ſame further,
but only yt in viii. daies that y• Captaine generall ſtaid ther,
was ſéene a fiſh which ye ſea did caſt a land, yt was greater
then any Tonel, & of ye bredth of two of thē, howbeit he was
round: y• head & eyes were much like vnto a hogs, his cares
like vnto an Elephants, he had no téeth, but vnder his belly
he had two iſſues, his taile was thrée quarters of a yard
in breadth, & as much in length, his ſkinne, was lyke vnto
a Hogges ſkinne, which was a finger thicke. In this Ilande
the Captaine generall commaunded to be erected a
high Croſſe of ſtone, and therfore he gaue the ſame to name
La tierra de Santa Crus. From hence he ſent a Caruell
which he brought foorth with him for the ſame purpoſe,
with letters vnto the King his Lorde, of all that which
had chaunced him vnto this place, and how that he had left
there two banniſhed men of thoſe twentie, the which

he carried with him, to the ende they might better enforme
themſelues what Countrey that ſame was, and whether it
were a firme lande, as it did appeare vnto them, all, by the
great diſtance of the Coaſt that they had found, and becauſe
of the great voyage which he had taken in hande to make,
he could not ſend to know perfectly. With this Caruel he
ſent a man of that Countrey for a ſhew, by what kinde of
people the ſame was inhabited. This Caruell being departed,
the next day after being the ſecond day of May, the Captain
generall departed with all his Fléete, bearing his courſe
toward the Cape Buena eſpe
                        •
                     anſa, the which was from
thence almoſt 1200. leagues, which is a great and fearfull
gulph to paſſe, by reaſon of the great windes which doe
courſe in thoſe partes, moſt of the time. And being vnder
ſayle in the ſame, on the xii. of Maye there appeared in the
Element a great Comet with hir beames,A Comet ſeene in the elemēt the which came
out of the Orient, and for the ſpace of x. dayes did alwayes
appeare as well in the night as in the daye, alwayes inlarging
his beames. On Saterday being the xxiii. of May, there
came amongſt all the Fléete ſuch a ſtorme from the Northeaſt,
that all the Fléete was faine to take in their ſayles,
hauing the Seas very high mingled with pretie ſhowers of
raine And for that the ſame ſtorme was afterwarde ſomewhat
abated, they brought themſelues vnder their forefailes
againe, and at night the winde being altogether calme, ſuch
ſhips as wer left behind, did ſpred out alſo their ſprit ſaile, to
ouertake thoſe yt went before. And going by after windes, &
following their courſe by the South, the Sunday being the
xxiiii. of May, the winde beganne to increaſe, which was the
occaſion that the Captaine generall commanded their ſailes
to be taken in, and to fardle vp their ſprits ſailes, the which
being done, the like did all the other Captaines, and going
on this ſort on Sunday, betwéene x. and xi. of the clocke of
the day, did begin to ariue in the Northweſt a ſpowte, with
the which the winde calmed in ſuch ſorte, that the ſailes
did beate againſt the Maſt, and the Pilots being (not as yet
acquainted with the ſecret ſignification of a ſpowte) for that

they had not trauayled thoſe Seas, thought the ſame to bée
a ſigne of faire weather, and of great calmes: by reaſon
whereof, they neuer made any kinde of alteration in anye
thing, appertaining to their ſayles. Vpon this on a Sundaye,
there came ſuch a winde and ſo furious, that then
they had no time to amayne and take in theyr ſayles, by
reaſon whereof, there were foure Shippes ſunke without
eſcaping one perſon of them all,four ſhips ſunke by tempeſt, and of one of theſe was
Captayne one Bartholomew Dias. The other ſeauen remayned
halfe full of water, which they had taken in, which
lykewiſe had ſunke, if ſo be that parte of theyr ſayles had
not bene torne.
               And after that the winde verred to the Southweſt they
bare with the ſame, the which was ſo great that they were
driuen to roue all that daye and the next night following
without ſailes, ſo that the one could not ſée the other, & howſoeuer
as yet the returne of any other wind was not come,
they were driuen to ſuch daunger that they thought thereby
they ſhould looſe their liues, forſomuch as the reſt of the
Fléete was ſo caſt away before their eyes, wherewith they
were ſtroken into a very great penſiueneſſe. The next day
the winde being ſomewhat incalmed, with the ſame the
Fléete did ioyne themſelues together againe, and immediatly
after, the winde came to the Eaſt and Northeaſt, which
was ſo great that it made the Seas to goe higher then euer
they did before,A vvōderful ſtorme and great Seas. and ſo the ſame endured the ſpace of xx.
dayes: and all this time the ſhippes laye a hull, although
they proued fiue times to hoyſe vp their ſayles, as aforeſaid.
Now the Seas went ſo high to all theyr iudgements, they
thought it vnpoſſible for the ſhippes to eſcape: for ouer and
beſides that, by the working of them it was thought, that
ſometime they did hoyſe vp theyr ſhippes aboue the Element,
and other times when the ſhippes began to deſcend,
they fell as it were downe a monſtrous hill, that they feared
they ſhould be all ſwallowed vp in the Intralles of the
Earth.
               In the daye the water was of the colour of pitch, and

in the night of fire. The tackling with the other furniture
of the Shippes, with the great force of the winde, made
ſuch a terrible noyſe, and was ſo fearefull to heare, that
the ſame is incredible to be beléeued, but by thoſe onelye
that endured and paſſed the ſame, with the force of this,
the Fléete was ſeparated into ſundry places. The Captaine
Generall bare vp with Symon de Myranda, and Pedro
de Tayde, whether the winde would carry them: all
the others went at Gods mercie.
            
            
               Of the meeting of the King of Quiloa & the Captaine
generall, at which time there was ſet downe
a Trade and Factorie, and how the King repented
himſelfe of the ſame afterward. Cap. 30.
               
                  AFter that the Captaine Generall
had paſt with parte of his Fléete,
theſe great ſtormes didde finde himſelfe
to haue doubled the Cape,
without anye ſight of the ſame, hauing
in his company no more then
two Shippes, which bare alwayes
vp with him. And the Lorde hauing
vſed alwaies towardes them
his wonderfull great mercie, he came within ſight of the
lande the ſixtéenth day of Iuly, towarde the which he commaunded
to beare, howbeit the Pilots did not knowe the
ſame, notwithſtanding they found that it ſtoode in the altitude
of xxvii. degrées, they were ſo néere vnto lande, that the
Shippes laye with their beake heads cloſe to the ſame.
But the Captaine generall would not conſent that anye of
his men ſhoulde goe a lande: yet from their ſhippes they
might eaſilye perceiue, that the ſame was well inhabited,

for the great number of people they did ſée there, and yet
of all thoſe there came none to the water ſide, to ſée what
we were.
               After that he ſawe that there was no hope to haue anye
refreſhing from thence, hée did afterwarde procure the
ſame from the Sea, where there was great plentie of fiſh,
where our men was driuen to fiſh for it. Afterwarde
the Captaine generall commaunded to weye their Ankors,
and to followe his courſe, ſo néere vnto the ſhore, that he
might well ſée great numbers and ſtore of ſundrye beaſtes,
which fed along the Riuer, that entred into the Sea, and
alſo they ſawe many people.
               Now going on that ſort,They cōe to Sofala the Captaine generall did paſſe
vnto Sofala, with the which as yet the Pilot was not acquainted,
and being néere to the ſame, he ſawe two Ilandes
and right ouer againſt one of them there was riding
at an Ankor two Shippes, which as ſoone as they
had diſcouered our Fléete, did beginne to flye awaye towarde
the ſhore. And for that the Captaine generall ſawe
that they fiedde, he commaunded to followe them, which
was done in ſuch ſort that our men did ouertake them, and
tooke ſome of them priſoners, for that they did not defende
themſelues, and concerning the chiefeſt perſon that was
in theſe Shippes, the Captaine Generall was aduertiſed
that he was the King of Mylyndes néere kinſman, and
was going from Sofala laden with Golde to Mylynde.
Who confeſſed, that when they had deſcryed our Ships,
they receiued ſuch a feare, as though they ſhoulde bée
taken, and that therefore they did throwe the moſt part
of theyr Golde into the Sea, and they themſelues ranne
a lande.
               After that all this was done, ye Captaine general told him
that he was very ſory for theyr ſo great miſchance & loſſe,
in eſpecially for ſo much as the King of Mylynde was in
ſo great a credite with the King of Portingale his Maſter,
which is the occaſion, that all Portingales are and ſhall
bée alwayes at his commaundement. And hauing ſhewed

vnto him great courteſie, he commaunded the Shippes to
be retourned with all the golde they hadde founde in the
ſame.
               The Moore aſked of him whether he had brought with
him any Witches, that they might with words of inchantment
fetch vp ſuch golde as was throwen into the Sea.
To whom the Captaine generall made aunſwere, that the
Chriſtians doe beléeue in the true God, who hath and doth
defende them ſo, that they doe not vſe nor beléeue in witchcraft,
and therefore they do not vſe the ſame. Of this Moore
the Captaine generall was aduertiſed, that he hadde ſomewhat
ouer runne Sofala, and for that he would not returne
backe, he did at this time leaue it, and hauing diſpatched the
Moore, followed his courſe, and on the xx. of Iuly arriued at
Monſanbique, where he tooke in his water, and a Pilot to
carry him to the Ilande of Quiloa, toward the which he directed
his courſe, running along the Coaſt. In this his voyage
he ſaw ſundry profitable Ilands which were belonging
to the King of Quiloa,
                  The king of Quiloa a mightie Prince. which as I haue declared is a great
Prince, and is Lord from the Cape De las correntes, almoſt
vnto Mombaſſa, ye which is welnéere foure hundred leagues
of Coaſt, in the which there doe enter the two Ilands that
I haue ſpoken of before, ouer and beſides Sofala, and other
ſundry Townes vnto Monſanbique, and from thence as
many more vnto Mombaſſa, with an infinit number of Ilandes,
that doth yéeld him great rents. Notwithſtanding
as touching his eſtate it is but ſmall, for he is not able to
make many men of warre: his abode is alwayes in Quiloa,
in a certaine Ilande, which is a hundred leagues beyonde.
Monſanbique in the Coaſt of Aethiopia, néere to the
firme lande, the which is verye fertill of Orchardes, and
Woodes, that beare ſundry ſorts of fruites, there are excellent
good waters, and alſo they doe ripe great ſtore of Miſo,
and other ſeedes which they doe ſow, and there is bred
vp in the ſame great ſtore of ſmall Cattell. In thoſe Seas
there is great plentie of Fiſh, and that verye good. So
that what with the victualls that they haue in the lande,

and what there commeth from other places of the firme
land,The deſcriptiō of the city of Quyloa. the Citie is plentifully prouided, which citie is compaſſed
about with faire gardens on the one ſide, & with the
ſea on the other, which cauſeth the ſame to ſhew very pleaſant,
it ſtandeth in ix. degrées to the South, & is alſo greate
and full of people. Their houſes are made of lime & ſtone,
in the which there are goodly chambers. Their king is a
Moore, and ſo are the inhabitants, the naturall people of the
Countrie are a kinde of blacke people, and thoſe that are
ſtrangers are white, their common language is Algarauia.
They doe apparell themſelues very richly, in eſpeciall the
women, for they carry alwaies vpon them great ſtore of
iewels of gold. They are great Merchants, for their trade
is of the gold that commeth from Sofala, and from this citie
it is diſpearſed to all the Countrie of Arabia Felix, & other
places, and therfore there reſort thether many merchaunts
frō other places. Ther are alwaies in this port many ſhips
which lyeth alwayes a ground when they haue no néed of
thē.Shippes vvithout nailes. Theſe ſhips haue no nailes, but are ſowed together wt
ropes made of Cairo, & pitched ouer with wildincenſe, for
becauſe as in all yt countrie there is no other kind of pitch.
The winter in this countrie doth begin in Aprill, & maketh
an end in September. The Captaine Generall béeing
come to the harbour of this Citie, and hauing obteined
of the king a ſafe conduct that hée might ſend him a meſſenger,
did ſend vnto him Alonſo Hurtado, who went accompanied
with ſeauen of the principals of their ſhips, and
that they might ſhew themſelues in more countenaunce &
authoritie, they went in their beſt apparell. Béeing come
before the king, he repreſented vnto him the meſſage which
the Captaine Generall gaue him, which was to ſignifie
vnto him yt he was come thether with ye king of Portingale
his Maiſters fléete, to ſettle a trade in ye citie, & to the
ſame end had brought with him great ſtore of merchandiſe y•
were conuenient to be ſpent in y• country, & therfore he was
deſirous to talk with him therin, howbeit ye king his maiſter
did countermand him yt in any wiſe he ſhuld not leap a

land, but make the agréement a ſea boord, foraſmuch as that
is the auncient cuſtome which the Captaines doe alwaies
obſerue in his coūtry, becauſe yt if ſo be ther ſhuld chance any
miſfortūe to their general, which is their head, immediatly
are caſt away the reſt that are vnder his gouernment.
To this the king made anſwere with a good countenance,
yt he was alſo deſirous to ſee the Captaine Generall, and to
ſpeak with him a ſea boord, ſince there was no other remedie,
Alonſo Hurtado hauing receiued this anſwere, made ye
Captaine Generall priuie therof, who ye next day after tarryed
for ye king in his boat, which was couered ouer & ſet
out with flags. There did attend vpon him al the reſt of ye
Captaines in their boates, & at this preſent arriued there,
Sancho de Toar with other two ſhips. The king thus being
looked for, at the length he came in an Almadia, béeing
well accompanied with ſundrie Gentlemen in other boats,
lykewiſe furniſhed, which alſo were ſet out with flags, and
had in them thoſe that ſounded vpon trumpets & cornets,
& Sagbuts, which made a wonderfull great noiſe. Now the
king being come where the Captaine Generall was tarrieng
for him, all his ordinance went of in ſuch ſort & with
ſuch a force, that it made the ſea to tremble, wherwith the
king and all his traine, forſomuch as they were not accuſtomed
vnto the ſame,The meeting of ye king & ye Captaine Generall. were greatly afeard. As ſoone as the
ordinaunce went of, the king & the Captaine General met,
& that with great pleaſure. And after that the king of Portingales
letter was read, which was for y• ſetling of a trade
in his citie, he anſwered that he was contented therewith,
& did agrée that the next day he ſhould ſend Alonſo Hurtado
a land, to tell him the ſorts of the merchaundiſe that he
had brought with him, & he wold giue him gold for ye ſame.
Vpon this agréement Alonſo Hurtado was ſent a land the
next day following, howbeit he found the king far from ye
which was agréed vpō with ye captain general ye day before,
yelding therfore ſundry excuſes,A malitious & ferfull More▪
                   why he could not accōpliſh
his promiſe, in eſpecial for yt he han no néed of his merchandiſe,
& alſo for yt he beléeued that ye Captaine generall came

thether to take his country from him. This ſodeine chance
was for this cauſe, forſomuch as he was a Moore, and wée
were chriſtians, it gréeued him to haue any conuerſation or
trade with vs. This being come to ye Captaine generalls
knowledge, he did as yet tarrye thrée or foure dayes, to
ſée whether y• the king wold change any thing of his determination
or not, howbeit he did nothing alter his mind, but
rather had our men in iealouſie, fearing leaſt that he ſhuld
be driuen to do y• by force, which he was loth to do, & therfore
did fortifie himſelfe with many men in a readineſſe.
As ſoone as the Captaine Generall heard of his dealing, he
would ſpend no more time there, but departed toward Milinde,
kéeping alwaies along the coaſt.
            
            
               How the king of Milinde and the Captaine Generall
met together, and how hee departed afterwards toward
Calicut. Chap. 31.
               
                  ON the ſecond day of Auguſt, he came to an ankor
in the port of Mylinde, where hée found riding
at an ankor thrée ſhips of ye Moores ye which wer
of yt Merchannts of the kingdome of Cambaya,
but he would not meddle with them, although they were
laden wt great riches, becauſe of ye king of Milinde. Being
come with al his fléet to an ankor, he ſaluted ye citie wt all
his ordinance. The king with this ſent to viſit him, ſending
alſo vnto him for a preſent, both ſhéep, ducks, & hens, wtout
all number, beſides ſundrie ſorts of fruits. Then y• Captain
general ſent likewiſe to kiſſe his hands, by one of his fléet,
& alſo to ſignifie vnto him, yt thether he was come by his
Maſter ye king of Portingales cōmandement, to know whether
he had any need of this fléet to do him ſeruice wtall, &
alſo to certifie him, y• he had to deliuer vnto him a rich preſent,
with a letter, the which ye King his maſter had likewiſe
ſent vnto him, which he wold ſend whēſoeuer he wold
cōmand ye ſame, with this meſſage ye king ſhewed himſelf to
be wel pleaſed, & cōmanded the meſſenger to remaine with
him that night, with whom he talked and ſpent moſt part
thereof in matters of Portingale.
                  
And as ſoone as it was day the king ſent by two principall
Moores word vnto the Captaine Generall,The kings meſſage to ye Captaine Generall. that he was very
glad of his comming, and alſo to knowe whether he had
néede of anye thing in his countrie which he might commaund
as his owne, and make as much account thereof,
while he was there, as if he were in Portingale, conſidering
the greate good will which hée doth owe vnto the king
of Portingale, and that in all his affaires he ſhuld make as
much reckoning as of his owne home. The Captaine Generall
hauing well vnderſtood the kings meſſage, vpon the
ſame determined to ſend him the kings letter, which hée
had brought, and alſo the preſent, which was all the furniture
of a Iennet horſe, which was alſo both rich & gallant.
And hauing taken his counſel vpon ye ſame, it was agréed
vpon to ſend it, and that Aries Correa ſhould haue the cariage
thereof, forſomuch as hée was the factor of the whole
Fleete, and alſo for that hée went for Factor to the king
of Calicut, and that he ſhould ſo goe accompanyed with the
principalls of the Fléet, beſides the trumpetors, that ſhould
goe alwaies ſounding before him, which was ſo done. The
king being informed of ye cōming of Aries Correa, ſent of
the nobles of his Court to receiue him, which might the
more eaſilye bée done, for that the kings pallaice was hard
by the water ſide, and going altogether, there were certeine
women which by the kings commaundement were
tarryeng for their comming, with perfuming pans in their
hands, out of the which there came ſo excellent a perfume,
that it did repleniſh the whole earth therewith And paſſing
after this ſorte by theſe women, hée came to the kings pallaice,
who was ſitting in his chaire of eſtate, and accompanyed
with many noble mē & Gentlemen, who alſo receiued
Aries Correa with great honour and pleaſure, and alſo the
preſent. Afterward he gaue him the letter which was written
on both ſides, on the one ſide was Portingale, the other
in the Arabian tongue, which the king commanded forthwith
to be read, which both he and all the nobilitie were
very gladde to heare. And all they together with a lowde

voice gaue God and Mahoma great thanks that they had
permitted them to haue friendſhip wt ſo great a Prince as
ye king of Portingale. And alſo being very wel pleaſed with
the furniture of the Ienet, he requeſted Aries Correa to ſtay
with him, whileſt the Fléete did there remaine, which with
the Captaine Generalls licenſe he did, & during the three
daies that he was with him, almoſt he ſpent his time in no
other thing, but to knowe the vſe & cuſtome of the king of
Portingale, & of the order of his gouernment, & alſo perticularly
as though yt he did remember no other matter all y•
time, & being deſirous to ſee ye Captain general, did procure
with as much diligēce as he could to haue him a land, & to
bring him to his pallaice, notwithſtanding he made his excuſe,
ſaieng, yt the king his maſter had commanded him not
to come a land in any port, with this anſwere ye king was
driuen to encounter with him vpon the water, who would
néeds go as far as ye water ſide on horſback, with y• furniture
of a Ienet yt the king of Portingale had ſent him. And
for yt in his country he had none yt could tel ye order therof,
he requeſted one of our men to do ſo much. And when the
king had all things in a redines, ther wer tarrieng for him
certein of ye principals, at ye foot of a ſtaire, & amongſt them
ther was brought a liue ſhéep, which whileſt ye king was
cōming down, they did open as he was aliue, & after yt they
had taken out his guts & bowels, they laid y• ſame vnder ye
horſe féet. The king being now on horſbacke he went alſo
with his horſe vpon ye ſhéepe,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   which is a kinde of ceremony
y• the witches ther do vſe. After yt he had thus troden vpon
the ſhéepe, he went toward ye water ſide, with all his company
after him a foot, ſaieng wt a lowd voice certein words
of witchcraft. And after this ſort he met with the Captaine
Generall vpon ye water, where he deliuered him a Pilot
to carrie him to Calycut. Heere there were lefte with the
king two of thoſe baniſhed men that they might enforme
themſelues of the countrie, as farre as in their ſtrength,
one of thoſe was called afterwarde Machado, who after
that hée had gotten the Arabian language, went by lande

vnto the ſtraights, and from thence vnto the kingdome of
Cambaya, from whence he did paſſe to Balagarte, and did
there ſettle himſelfe, with the Sabayo, that was Lorde of
Goa, ſaieng, that he was a Moore, and for the ſame, he was
taken in all that Countrie, this his trauell was very profitable

how afterward he came a land for to ſee him, and of
his receiuing there. Cap. 22.
               
                  THe Captaine Generall béeing returned to
his ſhips, departed toward Calycut, being
the 7. day of Auguſt, & on the 20. he came
to Anſadina, wher he ſtaied certeine daies
for the comming of the ſhippes of Meca,
with intent to ſet vpon thē if ſo be yt they
came thether. And whileſt they were there, they did confeſſe
themſelues, and afterward did receiue the Sacrament,
And they ſéeing that there came no ſhips, departed toward
Calycut, and on the 13. of September he came to an ankor
within a league of the ſame. And immediatly there came
certeine Almadias toward our fléete,The king of Calycuts meſſage to ye Captaine Generall. to ſell victuals, & alſo
there came certein Nayres of ye moſt principall belonging to
y• king of Calicut, with a certeine Guzarate merchant, by
whom ye king ſent word vnto ye Captaine General, y• there
could not haue happened a better thing vnto him then to
vnderſtand yt he was come vnto his port, & that hée could
not do him no better pleaſure thē to command him, if ther
were any thing in his citie yt he had néed of, & he would accompliſh
ye ſame with great good wil: whervnto y• Captaine
generall made anſwere with great thanks, & ſéeing wt what
good will y• king ſent to viſit him, he brought himſelf to an
ankor néere vnto ye citie, alwaies ſhooting of his ordinance,
with ye which he did ſalute thē, which was ſo great a wonder

to the dwellers, that thoſe that were Gentiles ſaid, that
againſt vs there were no reſiſtaunce. The next daye following
by the conſent of the Captaines of the Fléete, the
Captaine Generall ſent by one whoſe name was Gaſpar,
to demaund a ſafe conduct of the king for to ſend a meſſenger
vnto him, ſending alſo with the ſaide Gaſpar thoſe
foure Malabars that Don Vaſco de la gama had carried
from Calicut. Theſe went all apparelled in a gallant ſort,
after the Portingales order, whom all the citie came forth
to ſée, who meruailed to beholde them to returne ſo well,
which was the cauſe that they were ſo well pleaſed with
our men, & that they were had in ſo great reputation. But
forſomuch as theſe were but fiſher men the king woulde
not ſée thē, although he was glad to vnderſtand after what
ſorte they returned, & commaunded yt the ſaid Gaſpar ſhuld
be brought before him, whome he receiued very well. And
after that he knew wherfore he came, aunſwered him, that
whoſoeuer of our men would come a lande, might without
any feare at all. This anſwere béeing come to ye Captaine
Generalls eares, he ſent preſently vnto the king Alonſo
Hurtado, to ſignifie vnto him yt the ſaid fléet belonged
to the king of Portingale, of the which he went for Captaine
Generall, and that his comming thether was for no
other purpoſe but onely to ſettle wt him a trade & friendſhip,
for the which it was conuenient for him, to talke
with him. Howbeit hée ſayde, the king his Maiſter hadde
commaunded him, that he ſhoulde not doe it, without he
might for the aſſurance of his perſon, receiue ſome pledges
to remaine in the ſhippes whileſt hée was a lande with
the king, and that the one of thoſe pleadges ſhould be the
Catuall of Calicut,
                  The king of Calicut maketh excuſes vvhen he ſhould deliuer pledges and Araxamenoca, the which is
one of the principalleſt Nayres: And another there went
with Alonſo Hurtado, one that coulde ſpeake the language,
which ſhoulde declare vnto the king the effect of
the meſſage.
               The king béeing héereof informed meruailed much to
heare that the Captaine general did demand thoſe pledges,

which he did excuſe to giue, forſomuch as they were ſickly
& olde, howbeit he ſaid he would giue others that coulde
better abide the branneſſe of the ſea. But afterwards hée
did inſiſt very much, not to giue any pleadges at all, forſomuch
as thoſe that were Moores were verye ſorrie to ſée
our men in Calycut, and gaue the king counſell to ſende
none, for that in giuing of any he might wel iudge therin y•
the Captaine Generall had but little confidence in him, and
by this meanes he ſhould remaine diſhonoured. Yet for al
this Alonſo Hurtado did ſtill inſiſt in his demaunde. In
this encountrie they ſpent thrée daies. At the end the king
hauing a deſire to haue a trade ſetled with ours, for the benefit
that might redound vnto him by the ſame, did conſent
to Alonſo Hurtado his requeſt, in giuing the pleadges
that were demaunded, which being come to the Captaine
Generalls knowledge, he began to make himſelfe in a readineſſe
to goe and ſpeake with the king, and to remaine a
land thrée or foure daies, apointing in his place Sancho de
Toar, to whom he gaue commaundement that there ſhuld
be made for thoſe pleadges at their comming aboord good
enterteinment, and to looke well vnto them, and not to deliuer
them to any that ſhould come to demaunde them, although
they came in his name.
               On the xxviii. daye of December the Captaine Generall
put himſelfe in his beſt apparell, and carryed with
him thirtie of the principall men of his Fléete, which
ſhoulde remaine with him a lande, with others that were
the kings ſeruauntes, which ſhoulde attende vppon him
as vpon the kings own perſon. Hée commanded alſo to bée
carryed with him all the furniture for his Chamber and
Kitchin, with his Cupboorde of Plate, in the which there
were many rich péeces of ſiluer gilted.
               Nowe béeing with all theſe thinges in a readyneſſe to
depart, there came from the Citie ſundry principall Nayres,
which were commaunded by the king to attende vppon
the Captaine Generall, accompanyed with manye
men, beſides others that came ſounding vppon Trumpets,

other vppon Sackbuts and other inſtrumentes.
The Captaine generall being informed that the King was
tarrieng for him in a certaine Galerie, which onelye for to
receiue him in, he had commaunded to be made harde by the
water ſide, tooke his boate and went toward the ſhore, beeing
accompanied with all the other boats of ye Fléete, which
went all in good order, and ſet out with manye flagges and
trumpets, which being ioyned together as wel theſe as thoſe
that came from the Citie, made a wonderfull noyſe. With
this came thoſe pledges aboord the Generalls ſhip,Pleadges are ſent aboorde, vvhich feare to be taken captiue. into the
which they were loath to enter, vntill ſuch time that ye Captaine
generall did diſimbarke himſelfe a lande, giuing therby
to vnderſtand that they wer afeard that they being once
aboord, he would returne againe into the Fléete, and ſo take
them for captiues. They did ſtand ſo much vpon the ſame,
that Aries Correa was faine to tell them, that without any
ſuſpition they might enter into the ſhippe, forſomuch as
the Captaine generall was not come thether for to deceiue
the King, but onely for to get his good will, with this they
were contented, to goe aboorde, yet it was with ſome feare,
that he would take them captiues. In the meane while that
we were about this the Captaine generall landed, where
there was tarrieng for him ſundry Caymales and Pymacales,
and other principall Nayres, being accompanied with
many others. And before that the Captaine generall coulde
ſet his féete on the grounde, he was taken vp, and put in
an Andor or chaire, in the which he was carried to the Serame,
accompanied with the multitude aboue ſaide. Being
come to this place, he entered into a certaine houſe where
the King was, whome he founde in this order. The
houſe was hanged ouer with Carpets, or as they call them
Alcatifas, at the ende whereof, there was a certaine place
where the King was ſitting,The king of Calycuts ſtate & furniture. made much lyke vnto a lyttle
Chappell, and ouer the Kings head did hang the cloth of Eſtate,
of vnſhorne Crimſon veluet, and vnder him and about
him, were twentie cuſhions of ſilke. The King himſelfe
was all naked, ſauing that about his middle he had a cloth

made of Cotten, which was white as ſnowe, and wrought
ouer with golde. On his head he had a night cap of cloath
of golde, which was made of the faſhion of an head péece or
ſkull. On his eares he had hanging certaine Iewelles, of
Diamonds, Saphyres and Pearles, of the which ther was
two bigger then Walnuts. On his armes from the elbow
to the hande he had ſundrye Bracelettes of Golde, in the
which there were precious Sones, and that without
number, and of a wonderfull valewe. Moreouer on his
legs from the knées downward, and on the fingers of his
handes, and the toes of his feete, and eſpecially on his great
toe, there was a ring, in the which there was a Rubie ſo
great and fine, that it gaue ſuch a light as was wonderfull:
amongſt al which ſtones, ther was a Diamond bigger then
a great Beane. But all this was nothing in compariſon of
his girdell, which was made of Golde and Stone that the
ſame was aboue all price, and out of it there came ſuch a
reſplendour or brightnes, that it blinded mens eyes to looke
vpon it.
               There ſtoode harde by him a Chaire of Eſtate of golde
and ſiluer, wrought in the beſt manner, full of precious
ſtone, and of the ſelfe ſame ſort was the Andor in the which
he was brought from his Pallaice, which alſo ſtood there,
Alſo there were twentie Trumpets, whereof ſeauentéene
were of ſiluer, and the other thrée of golde, the mouthes
whereof, were finely wrought and ſet with ſtone. Alſo ther
was a Baſon of golde in the which he did ſpit, and certaine
perfuming pans of ſiluer, out of the which, ther came an excellent
ſmell. And for eſtate ſake ther wer lightned certain
Lampes of Oyle, which were after the Moores order, the
which were alſo made of ſiluer. Sixe paces from the
King, ſtood his two brethren, which were heires
vnto the Kingdome after him, and ſomewhat
further off ſtood many Noble
men, they all ſtanding vpright
vppon theyr
féete.
            
            
               
               ¶Of the meeting of the Captaine generall, and the
King of Calycut and how there was deliuered
vnto him the Kings preſent which he brought,
and afterward what hapned. Chap. 23.
               
                  THe Captaine generall béeing entered into
this place, and viewing the Kings eſtate,
wold haue gone to kiſſe the Kings handes,
as it is commonly vſed amongſt vs: but for
that he was enformed by thoſe that ſtoode
by, that it was not the vſe and cuſtome amongſt
them, he did it not. Howbeit ther was a Chaire appointed
him that was hard by the Princes ſeate, in y• which
the Captaine generall did ſit, that from thence he might declare
his minde to the King, which was the greateſt honor
that he could giue him.The Captaine generall deliuereth his letters of credite to the king of Calicut Being ſet downe, he deliuered his
letter of credite, which he brought from the King of Portingale,
written in the Arabian tongue which béeing read
by the King, ye Captaine generall alſo told his meſſage, the
effect wherof was this, That ye King of Portingale was deſirous
of his friendſhip, & to ſettle a Factorie in Calycut, in
the which there ſhoulde be ſufficient of all kinde of Merchandize
that ſhould be ſpent there, & in trucke of the ſame,
or for ready mony, he requeſted that he would let him haue
ſufficient lading of ſpices for thoſe ſhips there. The King
ſhewed himſelfe to be content with this Embaſſage, & aunſwered
the Captaine generall that he wold yéeld the King of
Portingale out of his Citie, all that he ſhoulde haue néede
of.The preſēt vvhich ye generall brought with him▪
                   While they two were in this talke, came thether the
preſent which the Captaine generall had brought, in the
which wer theſe péeces, a Baſon of ſiluer and gylt wrought,
a fountaine to the ſame, a Cuppe with his couer gylt, of the
ſame worke, two Maſſes of ſiluer, foure Cuſhions, two
of them of cloath of golde, and other two of Crimſon
Veluet vnſhorne, a Cloath of Eſtate of Golde, being
welted and garded with the ſelfe ſame Golde, and of

Crimſon veluet a verye fine Carpet, two clothes of Arras,
the which were very rich, the one with figures, and the other
with gréene workes. Of this preſent, and of the Embaſſage
which the Captaine generall had done vnto him, as it appered,
the King was very glad, and tolde the Captaine generall
that he might goe to his lodging to reſt himſelfe, or els
to his ſhips as he would himſelfe, for that he thought neceſſary
to ſend for his Pledges, which are Gentlemen and
daintely brought vp, and could not awaye with the Sea, to
tarry there longer. And whileſt they were ther, he was aſſured,
that they would neither eate nor drinke for ſuch was
their cuſtome. And if fo be that the Captaine generall wold
goe to his ſhips, and come the next day againe, to make full
agréement and conſent about the order of the trade in Calicut,
he would then ſend thoſe Pledges againe. The Captaine
generall hauing good confidence in thoſe his wordes,
went to his ſhips, leauing behinde him with his ſtuffe, Alonſo
Hurtado with other ſeauen. And being at the water
ſide ready to departe, a ſeruaunt of one of thoſe Pleadges,
went before aboord in a ſmall Pinnace, and tolde them that
the Captaine generall did retourne aboorde, this meſſenger
was ſent by the commaundement of the Clearke and Controller
of the Kings houſe, as who ſhoulde ſaye, to giue
them counſayle to come their waye, which they did, as
ſoone as they heard what the ſlaue had tolde them in their
language, and with that they leapt into the Sea, thinking to
take that Pinace in the which the ſlaue went. As ſoone as
Aries Correa ſaw this, he leapt into his owne boate, which
was harde by the ſhips ſide with certaine of his Marriners
and rowing with force tooke two of the Pledges, and alſo
thrée or foure of thoſe that wore in the Pinace, the other
fled and carried the Catuall with them, which was alſo one
of the Pledges. This being concluded, the Captaine generall
came aboord, who after that he had knowen what had
paſſed, becauſe that thoſe Pledges the which he had in his
cuſtodie, ſhould not returne and 
                     〈◊〉
                   their waye, he commaunded
them to be put vnder the hatches of his ſhip, and

afterward ſent to complain to the King of that which they
had done, laieng all the fault vpon the Clarke Controller.
Alſo he ſent worde after what ſort they remained in his
ſhip, promiſing, that if ſo be yt he wold ſend him his ſtuffe, &
ſuch of his men as remained a land, he would immediatly
ſende thoſe Pleadges which he had: and for that it was
night, there was no more at that time done. The next daye
following, the King came to the water ſide, accompanyed

                     〈◊〉
                   xii. thouſand men, and ſent with the Captaine General
                     •
                  
ſtuffe and men, to the number of thirtie Almadias,
for that they might returne with thoſe Pledges that did remaine
aboord, howbeit for all that they were ſo many, yet
there durſt none of them come néere the ſhips, for the feare
they ſtoode in of our men, which remained in the Fléete, leaſt
they wold take them, and ſo they returned with the ſame againe
to land. The Captaine Generall ſéeing the feare that
they ſtood in of his Fléete, ſent the next daye in certaine of
his owne boates thoſe Pledges that he had in cuſtodie, commaunding
that they ſhould goe and ſée them deliuered ſomwhat
aloofe of from the fléet, that brought him his men and
ſtuffe. And while they were deliuering the ſame, Araxamenoca
which was the eldeſt of the Pledges, leaped into the
water vppon a ſodaine, with intent to runne away, but for
all that he could not eſcape, forſomuch as our men caught
handefaſt of him. The other that remained, whileſt our
men were thus buſied fled lykewiſe. The lyke did Alonfo
Hurtado practiſe with fiue of thoſe that wer with him. The
Captaine generall meruailed to ſee how little honeſtie or
truth they vſed, did therefore commaund Araxameno

                     a to
be well looked vnto. And being thrée dayes paſt, and yet the
King not ſending for him, he had pittie to ſee him that in ſo
many dayes he had eaten nothing,Humai

of his mens, and requeſted him to ſend the other two of his
men that were yet a land, which the King did ſende, béeing
moued therevnto, more for ſhame then otherwiſe, for that
he had broken his word & promiſe. Now being thrée dayes

paſt, and there came no kinde of aunſwere vnto the Captaine
generall, thereby he had ſufficient tryall or vnderſtanding
how variable he was, and therefore he woulde tarrye
no longer for his aunſwere, but ſent vnto him to knowe
whether he wold make an end of the agréement yt was begun
betwéene them, and for the concluſion of the ſame hée
would ſende Aries Correa which came with him for Factor.
Howbeit for the better aſſuraunce therof, he willed him
to ſend him certaine Pledges. This meſſage was ſent 
                     〈◊〉
                  
King by a certaine Gentleman called Franciſco Correa,
which did offer himſelf to carry the ſame, when all the reſt of
the Fléete was afeard, leaſt that the King woulde take him
priſoner, or command him to be ſlaine. To this meſſage ye
king made anſwere yt he was well pleaſed to agrée to haue
the Trade ſetled, and that he ſhoulde ſende vnto him Aries
Correa about the ſame or whom els he ſhould thinke good.
But firſt of all he tolde him that he woulde ſende two Nephewes
of one Goſarate,
                  The pledges ſent aboord. which is a great rich Merchaunt,
for pledges, which indéed was ſo done. After that thoſe pledges
were entred, immediately departed toward the land Aries
Correa, to whom the King commaunded to be giuen a
faire houſe to lye and reſt himſelfe and to lay his Merchandize
in, which he brought with him, which houſe belonged to
Goſarate, who was Grandfather to thoſe two Pledges, that
the king had ſent. But he commanded that foraſmuch as Aries
Correa, was yet not well knowen in the Countrey nor
acquainted with their orders & prices how he might ſel his
Merchandize, nor yet what the buyer ſhuld giue, to inſtruct
him therein. But he did not ſo, but rather cleane contrarye,
foraſmuch as he was a friend to ye Moores of Meca, which
were great enimies vnto our men, not onelye for that they
were Chriſtians, but for feare leaſt that for our cauſe they
ſhuld looſe part of ther credit which they had in Calicut, by
meanes wherof they tooke their Merchandize for what price
ſo euer they would themſelues. And alſo for the feare they
conceiued of them many times, the Gentiles durſt not come
out of their dores.
               
                  
They knew alſo that hauing our Factory ſetteled there,
they ſhould be great looſers, not onely in their Merchandize,
which would be in valew leſſe worth, as alſo in their 
                     ••••
                  
                  ces,
Drugs & precious ſtones, which would be more worth &
better eſtéemed. And that was the cauſe that alwaies. Aries
Correa was ouerthwarted in all things yt he went about to
buy, with offring more then he did for the ſame, after yt the
price was by any of ours made, then euer they did before,
ſo yt by this meanes alwayes he was forced to pay the deerer
for his drugs & ſpices. And if ſo be that at any time he
would ſpeake with ye King, they did trauell all yt they could,
that ſome of them might be alwayes preſent to withſtand &
ſpeak againſt him in all things. They did not this onely thē
                  ſelues,
but found meanes alſo by Sam
                        •

of the Sea of Calicut, & a naturall Moore, yt he ſhould
not conſent yt thoſe yt remained in ye Factory wt 
                  Aries Correa
ſhuld go aboord ye Fléete, & moreouer if any ſhip would preſume
to come néere to yt ſhore, not to cōſent yt it ſhuld return,
ſaieng,The Captaine generall had good came to feare and hate the Moores yt the King had giuen ſuch cōmandement The Captaine
generall being aduertiſed of all this, & ſuppoſing the
ſame to be of a ſuſpition of treaſon, commanded to wey and
bring himſelfe vnder ſaile to goe out of that harbour, and
there to enter into councell with his Captaines what were
beſt for him to do, for that he was afeard leſt whileſt yt hée
remained in that harbour he might be ſet vpon by ye king of
Calicuts Fléete, & ſo be troubled. The King after yr the knew
what the Captaine generall had done, & that he minded to
go his way, demaunded of Aries Correa the cauſe why he
went out of his harbour, who aunſwered him that he did not
know certainely, wherfore without it were for the iniuries
which the Moores had done vnto him, & ſo told him ye whole
order, for that he knew the ſame. The King vpon this willed
him to ſend againe for the Captaine generall, who immediately
after that he knew, what the king had ſaid, returned,
& the King forthwith commanded that the Moores ſhuld
not from thenceforth vſe anye ſuch villany. He alſo tooke awaye
the Goſarate from the companye of Aries Correa,
                  
vnto whom he gaue charge to inſtruct him in the order of
the Countrey, and did put in his place another which was a
very honeſt man, and a friend of ours, (although he were a
Moore) whoſe name was Coſebequin. This man was alſo
in Calicut of good credite, and the head of all the Moores of
the Countrey, that were naturally borne there, which were
alwayes in controuerſie with the Moores of the Cayro, and
of the Straights of Meca, of the which the Admirall was
head. Alſo the King gaue commaundement, that to the end
our Merchaunts which were in the Factorie might ſell the
better, and alſo buye theyr Spices at the better hande, and
with quietneſſe, they ſhould remooue theyr Factorie to a
houſe of Coſebequin,
                  A free houſe for the factory giuē to the king of Portingale by deede the which ſtoode harde by the water
ſide. And of this houſe, a gifte was giuen to the King of
Protingale for euer by writing, the Copie whereof, forſomuch
as the Captaine generall ſhould carry it with him,
was incloſed in a Tablet of golde, to the which the King did
ſet to his firme and ſeale, alſo the Kings pleaſure was, that
vpon the top of the houſe there ſhould be ſet a flagge, with
the royall armes of Portingale, that all men might knowe,
that the ſame was his. Which after that the Captaine general
had knowledge of, he ſent vnto the King great thanks
for the ſame, and from that time forwarde they had indifferent
good ſales by the helpe of Coſebequm, who did aide
them therein. As ſoone as thoſe of the Countrey had vnderſtanding
that our Factorye was by the King ſo fauoured,
they lykewiſe did the lyke. Afterward our men might goe
whereſoeuer they would without any moleſtation, and as
ſure as they might in Liſhborne. So the friendſhippe betwéene
them and our men, was afterward very good.
            
            
               ¶How at the requeſt of the King of Calycut, the
Captaine Generall ſent to take a ſhippe of the
Moores, and alſo after what ſort the ſame was taken.
Cap. 24.
               
                  
                  WHileſt this friendſhip continued betwéene
our men and the Citie, and they béeing in ſo
great a friendſhip and concord one with another,
on the next ſaterday following there
did appeare to thoſe of Calycut, a greate
ſhip of the Moores, which was far off, going
from Coching toward Cambaya. And as ſoone as ye ſame
was diſcryed, the king ſent worde to the Captaine Generall,
requeſting him that for his ſake he would ſend to take
the ſame ſhip, for ouer and beſides that, there were in the
ſame certeine Elephantes, yet was there one which excéeded
them all, the which he woulde haue bought. And although
he had offred for him more then he was worth, yet
he would not ſell him. Albeit the owner was a dweller in
Coching, and therefore he moſt earneſtly requeſted him to
ſend to take the ſayd ſhippe, forſomuch as it did ſo highlye
touch his honour and credit: vnto his requeſt, the Captaine
Generall made aunſwere that he would doe it with a good
will, although that he was informed that the ſayd ſhippe
was great, and that there were within it very many men
both Marriners and ſouldiers, and that the ſame could not
bée taken without ſome loſſe of men, and therefore it was
requiſite that he conſented that his men might kill thoſe y•
were in the ſhip, wherevnto the king agréed. This béeing
concluded, the Captaine Generall commaunded that Pedro
de Tayde with his Caruell, ſhoulde goe take the foreſayd
ſhip, and that there ſhould goe with him a young Gentleman
called Edwarte Pacheco, which was thought to bée a
valiant ſouldier, and with theſe there was a 60. men.
The king alſo ſent certeine Moores in the Caruel, that they
alſo might view the order of their fighting. The Caruell
béeing vnder ſaile gaue chace vnto the ſhippe till it was
night, which being come, they loſt ſight of the ſame, and going
a long the coaſt all the quarter of the Moone, they ſawe
where he was riding at Ankor, and then Edwarto Pacheco
commaunded to beare with him, and found thoſe Moores

with their weapons in a readineſſe to defend themſelues
withall, howbeit as they were hoiſing vp theyr Sayles,
they eaſily iudged the ſame to be of 600. tun,This ſhip for one in thoſe coaſts very vvel appointed. and that within
it there were 300. fighting men, the moſt parte whereof
were bowe men, Edwarto Pacheco woulde not laye the
ſame a boorde, for that he was commaunded to the contrarie,
but to ſinke him if it were poſſible. And hauing brought
him vnder his lye, he commaunded to amaine. The Moores
making as it were a mocke of the ſame, gaue a lowd crye
and plaide vppon their Inſtruments, and after this they
ſhotte off certeine Ordinaunce which they had, and manye
arrowes, making therewith a ſhew of readineſſe that they
were in. They were anſwered by our men with ſhot, of the
which there chaunced a Pellette to ſtrike harde vnder the
boſſome of the ſhippe betwéene winde and water, where
there was made a hole by the which there entered a great
quantitye of water. After this they ſhotte againe, with the
which there were many of them ſlaine & hurt, & the other
trembled with the feare they had of our Ordinaunce, with
this they bare toward the baye of Canonor, the which was
harde by, where there were riding at an Ankor foure ſhips
of the Moores, amongeſt them hée came to an Ankor. Now
béeing within the ſayd Baye, arriued alſo with the Caruell
Edwarto Pacheco, who commaunded his Ordinaunce
to be ſhotte at them, and with the ſame had taken them
all, if ſo be that there had not come certeine Paraos of the
Moores to ſuccour them, the which were in the porte, and
as they were fighting the night came on, which was the
cauſe that al thoſe Paraos were not by him deſtroied. In al
theſe encounters there was no more then nine hurt of our
men, which was done by their arrowes.
               Night béeing come, Edwarto Pacheco brought himſelfe
forth of the Baye and came to Ankor harde by an
Ilande, for that hée was there more ſurer then in the Bay,
whereas they might haue ſette his ſhippe on fire. And although
that it were contrarye to his commiſſion, yet for
all that hée retourned in the morning, and ioyned himſelfe

with his enimyes, who as ſoone as it was daye, woulde
haue ranne theyr waye, and as they beganne to make
ſayle, hée entered vppon them in the Baye, ſhooting of his
Ordinaunce, with the which hée ſtrake the ſaide
Shippe,The Moores yeelded vnto our men. and by this meanes they yéelded, with this thoſe
of Cananor that were ſtanding at the water ſide, were
verye ſore agréeued and woulde haue come to ſuccour
them, who after that Edwarto Pacheco beganne to diſpend
his Ordinaunce amongeſt them; ranne lykewiſe theyr
wayes.
               This béeing done, hée went towarde Calycut, to the
which harbour hée arriued the next daye, where the King
came to the water ſide to ſée the ſhippe, for that they tooke
the ſame for a miracle, and gaue our men great praiſes.
The Captaine Generall commaunded the ſhippe to bée deliuered
vnto the king with ſeauen Elephaunts that were
within the ſame, which were worth in Calycut thirtye
thouſand crownes, ouer and beſides this, there was found
in it great ſtore of merchaundiſe, beſides thoſe men whom
hée tooke captiues. Alſo hée ſent the king word that hée néeded
not to meruaile that ſo ſmall a Caruell as that was
could take ſuch a great ſhippe, for that in matters of greater
waight he woulde be at his commaundement, for the
which hée ſent him great thanks, and praied him to ſende
vnto him thoſe men that had done ſo notable an act, whom
he did receiue very well, and with great honour, and gaue
them great gifts, in eſpeciall to Edwarto Pacheco.
Some affirme that after that the king had ſéene this famous
act that our men had done being ſo few, he had them
from thence forth in ſome feare, & was deſirous to ſée them
diſpatched out of his countrie, & therefore did conſent vnto
that treaſon, of the which I will ſpeake of héereafter.
            
            
               Of the Oration which the Moores made to the king,
concerning the enterteining of our men, and what
aunſwere there was made, & alſo pollicie vſed againſt
them. Chap. 25.
               
                  
                  WIth the taking of this ſhip the Moores of Calicut
were greatly afrighted in minde, and ſore
offended with y• king for that he made ſo great
account of our men, which as they thought
was done to reuenge their iniuryes, and for the
hatred or enuye they had conceiued againſt vs, though indéede
the king made more account of our men then he did
of them. By this meanes as they thought, it was no other
but to prouoke them to leaue his Countrie, in eſpeciall for
as much as our men brought them ſuch great ſtore of Merchandiſe,
and as much as they did, and brought as great
ſtore of ſpices as they did: Therefore they determined to
make vnto the king an Oration concerning the ſame matter.
And being ioyned together ſpake in the name of them
all, one on this ſort.
               
                  EMparather of all the Malabars,
                  The Moores Oration againſt our men. nothing leſſe mightie
then the mightieſt king of the Indias, & moſt fearefull
amongeſt thoſe that are feared of all the Princes of
the ſame. We cannot but meruaile much that thou hauing
theſe two qualyties, wouldeſt imbaſe thy ſelfe to
receiue into thy Countrie theſe y• are enimyes to thy law,
& ſtraungers to the cuſtomes of thy kingdome, & laſt of al,
doe rather appeare to be rouers then merchants. If thou
doeſt receiue them for want of ſuch as ſhoulde bring vnto
the Citie thoſe kindes of merchaundiſe that they do bring,
or elſe carrie away thoſe kinde of Spices that they are deſirous
of, we would then allowe thereof. But there are too
many that doth the ſame, and men that thou haſt knowne
of a long time, and by the long continuance of them art acquainted
with their fidelitie, which haue encreaſed ſo much
thy rents, that therof we are a good witneſſe. But thou hauing
forgotten all this, wouldeſt receiue thoſe whom thou
diddeſt not knowe, and doeſt fauour them ſo much, that amongeſt
ſo many, and ſuch a multitude of good ſubiectes as
thou haſt, wouldeſt make choice of them, that they ſhoulde
reuenge thy iniuries, as though thine owne ſubiects were
not ſufficient men to doe the ſame. By which déede thou

doeſt abaſe thy power ſo much, that we for very ſhame, &
for that we are bound of duetie to bring it into thy memorie.
For if ſo be yt thou well conſider what it is to make thē
reuengers of thy iniuries, & giue them in reſpect thereof
ſo great honour, it is as it were to ſhewe them plainly a
certeine kinde of weakneſſe which indéed is not in thy ſubiects,
but rather doeſt bolden them to make ſmall account
of thée, & ſo afterward to do that which we doe well know
they will do, which is to rob from all merchants that commeth
towards thy ports, to deſtroy thy country, & at length
to take the Citie, which is the end of their comming into
theſe parts, & not to looke for ſpices, and this is moſt true,
that from their countrie vnto this is almoſt fiue thouſand
leagues by ſea, with returnes and ſtormes that the ſame
voyage hath, ouer and beſides the great daunger of the voiage,
& the charges of the making of their great ſhippes, and
furniſhing the ſame with ordinance, beſides the ſtrengthening
of them with men, much more all this béeing wel noted,
it is plaine that for all their greate gaines which
they might haue by their ſpices in Portingale, their loſſes
would be greater,Proues that vvee vvere rather pirats then merchants. in comming ſo far for them, which is a
manifeſt proofe that they are rather pirats then merchants,
which come into the country to rob and take thy citie, as
they will do, if ſo be they do place themſelues once within
the ſame. And when they ſhal poſſeſſe the ſame houſe which
thou diddeſt giue them for a factorie, they will make there
a fort, from whence they will make thée wars, when thou
ſhalt thinke leaſt of it, which thing will come to paſſe, and
now the rather, ſince that thou doeſt commaunde the ſame
to be made by thy ſubiectes. But this as we ſaie wee doe
bring to thy memorie more for the good will which we doe
owe to thee, then for any profit we doe looke for. And if it
fortune that thou wilt not remember vs, there are other
cities in Malabar where we maye make our habitation,
whether for our ſakes will be brought all ſtore of ſpices.
Ouer and beſides all this, the loyaltie which we doe owe
vnto thée doth make vs to feare more the loſſe of thy eſtate,

then to 
                     〈◊〉
                   for our owne profit.
               As ſoone as the Moore had made an end of his Oration,
the king did gratifie them all very much, and tolde them
that he woulde haue a ſpeciall care of all that which they
had remembred him of, and how in the ſelfe ſame ſorte hée
ſuppoſed y• matter indeed wold come to paſſe.why he requeſted our men to take the ſhip of Meca. The occaſion
that the king tooke to requeſt the Generall to ſend to take
that ſhip▪ was to ſee the experience of their valiant minds,
& alſo why he did conſent to ye lading of their ſhips, was to
the end there might remaine in the countrie their monye
which they brought to buie merchaundiſe withall, according
as he did to ſuch merchants as come into his port.
Alſo at the laſt he did promiſe that he woulde not forſake
them for any ſtraunger. Yet for all this, the Moores did not
remaine fully ſatiſfied, becauſe the king did not command
vs to depart out of the citie of Calycut, and not ſuffer our
men to trade ther any longer, for that was the principalleſt
thing that they did pretende. Howbeit they woulde not
let but entermeddle in all our matters, eſpeciall in the buieng
of our Spices, which they did openly buye, and ſent
them ſecretly vnto other places. This was done with a
determinatiō, for yt they could not away with our men, but
wold reſiſt them, our men béeing thus reſiſted might then
haue occaſion the better to defend themſelues, & ſo by this
meanes they would reuenge their quarrels openly by fighting
with our men. This they had great deſire to do, thinking
to deſtroy our men openly, for that they were manye
more in number then ours were, they hoped that when this
matter was once begun, that then the king wold take their
parts. Alſo they wrought by all meanes poſſible to haue
the common ſorte of people on their ſide, inciting
them againſt our men, with matters which
they made them beléeue that our
men had done againſt
them.
            
            
               
               How the Moores that dwelled in Calycut by meanes
of the Factor & countenance they had at the kings
hand, did ſet vpon the Factorye, where was ſlaine
in defence there of the Factor with other of his
company. Cap. 36.
               
                  BY meanes of this ſubtile dealing of the
Moores, there paſt thrée moneths before the
Factor could get any ſpices more then hée
had, to lade two ſhips withall: which was
a great griefe to the Captaine Generall,
forſomuch as thereby he perceiued verye
well that the friendſhip of the king was not ſteadfaſt, but
that he was a lyar, and a man that vſed no truth at all.
And if ſo be that he had not tarried there ſo long time as
he did, fearing that in no other porte hée ſhould finde ſufficient
lading for his ſhippes, he would haue fallen out with
him, and ſo haue gone to ſome other place. But foraſmuch
as he hadde bene there at ſo greate charges, he diſſimuled
therewith onely to ſée whether with his good will he might
lade there or no. The Captaine Generall ſéeing that all
thinges were but delayes, ſent vnto the king, requeſting
him to remember thoſe promiſes he hadde made vnto
the Factour, that within twentye dayes he woulde deliuer
ſufficient lading for the whole Fléete, and that nowe
there were thrée moneths paſt, and yet there was no more
laden then two ſhippes.The king accuſed plainly of doblenes. The occaſion whereof he did not
knowe, and therefore he was the willinger to ſuffer the
ſame, and that with great patience, hoping alwayes that he
wold giue order for the lading of the reſt of the Fléet. But
now he ſawe howe all things went, and knew that it was
impoſſible to make an ende thereof.
               For although he had promiſed that his Fléete ſhould be
the firſt that ſhould be laden before any other ſtraungers,

and that he was enformed for moſt certeine, yt the Moores
had bought for a leſſe price great ſtore of Spices, and ſent
the ſame to other places, whether they would, he therefore
requeſted him yet to haue him in his remembrance, yt now
it was time for him to depart towards Portingale, deſiring
him to diſpa
                     ••
                  h him as he hadde promiſed. The King as
ſoone as he had heard what the meſſenger ſayd, did ſhewe
as in an outward appearance greatly meruailing that our
ſhips remained yet vnladen, and aunſwered that hée was
very 
                     〈◊〉
                   therefore, and that he could not beléeue that the
Moores contrarie to his commaundement had bought ſpices
vnder a coulour, and ſent the ſame a boorde ſome other
ſhip whether it pleaſed them, he hauing giuen commaundement
to the contrarie, namely, that the Moores ſhould not
buie any ſpices in hugger 
                     ••
                  gger. Affirming that if it bée
ſo they had ſo deceiued him, he woulde puniſh them therefore.
Vpon this immediatly he gaue commaundement to
take thoſe ſhippes that were laden with Spices, with condition
that they ſhoulde pay for the ſame the price that the
Moores had bought at.Nothing more acceptable to the Mores thē to quarell & fall out vvith our men, The newes was brought forthwith
vnto the Moores, and as there was nothing more acceptable
vnto them, then to haue occaſion to fall out with our
men, ſo therefore did one of the principall Moores beginne
to lade his ſhippe firſt, and that openlye with all ſortes of
Spices and Drugges. And for that cholar might the more
increaſe in our men, to take thoſe ſpices, hée found meanes
that certeine Moores which the Factor tooke to bée his verye
friends, and alſo certeine Gentiles, ſhoulde make him
beléeue that if ſo be that hée did not ſend to take that ſhip,
that was a lading, that then he could not haue lading ſufficent
for the Fléete.
               The Factor gaue credit vnto this report, and therevpon
ſent worde to the Captaine Generall, what the Moores and
Gentiles had tolde him, and that he thought their ſayeng to
be true. And therefore ſince the king of Calicut had giuen
him licenſe to take all ſuch Spices as the Moores had laden,
hée might the better nowe take that Shippe.

Howbeit the Captaine general was loath to deale therwith
for all the Kings licenſe, for he knew him to be an inconſtant
man, and waying alſo the great credit, that the Mores
were in with him, he was afeard leaſt that after they had
taken the ſaid ſhippe, the Moores through the Kings fauour
would riſe againſt them. And this was the aunſwere that
was ſent to the Factor: yet for all that he did require him
once more to take that ſhip, ſaieng, that if he did not, that
then the King ſhuld be in hazarde to looſe ſuch Merchandize
as he had ther: neuertheleſſe the Captaine general wold not
meddle therewith, and yéelding for that his determination
ſufficient reaſon to the contrary. But the Factor on ye other
part ceaſed not to make vnto him ſundry requeſts, and proteſtations,
that he ſhould paye all ſuch loſſes and damages,
as ſhould hap vpon the King of Portingales Merchaundize,
by his defaults, for that he woulde not deale with the ſayde
ſhip. Thus ſince he ſaw there was no other remedie, he cō
                  ſented
therevnto, although it were againſt his will: & therfore
the xvi. day of December, the Captaine generall ſent
word to thoſe that were aboord ye ſhip, that was thus laden
by the Moores, by the order which was ſent him from the
King of Calicut, to commaund them to depart, and for aſmuch
as they made but little reckoning thereof he ſent the
next daye all his boates to bring hir within the harbour.
After that this report came to the owner of the ſhips knowledge,
they made the Moores priuie héereof, whereof they
were very glad, for that by this meanes there was offered
vnto them occaſion to fall out with our men. Héerevppon,
they began in a furious outrage,The Moores moued a tumult againſt our men. running out of their dores
like madde men, complaining vpon vs and our people, by
meanes whereof, they were tumulteouſly moued, and framed
great outcryes and larums, and alwayes againſt our
men. And after that they had thus done, they ranne to the
King, with whom went the owner of the ſhip, complaining
alſo vpon our men for the detaining of his ſhip, ſaieng that
our men had bought and laden much more ſpices & drugs,
then that the Merchaundize came vnto which they hadde

brought with them, howbeit their pride was ſuch, that they
were content with nothing; but as Théeues and Pirates
would haue all. At this inſtant came the Moores, which did
before helpe him very much, declaring many things againſt
our men, & how much the King was in fault, for ſuffering
them within this Citie, requeſting him moſt earneſtlye to
giue them licenſe to reuenge their loſſe, which they had receiued.
The King as he was inconſtant and without anye
fidelitie, did graunt them the ſame. As ſoone as the Moores
had obtained their requeſt,The ſauage fircenes of the Moores againſt our men. they came their waye from the
King, and tooke their weapons, and with a ſauage fiercenes,
lyke wilde beaſts, ranne into the Citie in flockes towarde
the Factorie, which was compaſſed about like a Caſtle, with
the wall of the height of a man on horſebacke, in the which
were lxx. Portingales amongſt whom was Fryer Henrick
with his cōpany of Friers. Ther wer amongſt our men no
more weapons then 8. Croſſebowes, all ye reſt had nothing
but ſwords & clokes, as ſoone as they knew of ye enimies cō
                  ming,
they ran to the gates of the Factory, & when ye they
ſaw they were ſo few, they iudged them to be ſome quarellers
that came thether for the ſame purpoſe, & therefore wer
minded to defend their gates, with their cloakes & rapie
                     •
                  s
only: but afterward their power increaſed ſo much vpō our
men, that by reaſon of their arrowes and ſpeares, they could
not indure ther any longer: then y• Factor commanded their
gates to be ſhut vp, ſuppoſing that from the wal they wold
driue their enimies from thence, & at the very ſhutting vp
of the gates, there were ſeuen of the enimies ſlaine, ye which
gates could not be ſhut without great daunger, alwayes
fighting valiantly. In this conflict, ther wer of our men many
hurt, & foure ſlaine: howbeit as well thoſe ye wer hurt as
thoſe y• wer in health, went vp vpon ye wal of ye Factory, for
to defend their enimies from thence with their croſſebowes.
Howbeit the multitude of them at that preſent was ſo great
that they made ſhewe as if they had bene in number foure
thouſande. There came alſo to aide them ſundrye Nayres,
which all of them together, began to ſet vpon thoſe that wer

in the Factorie, hoping thereby to enter. Aries Correa ſéeing
ye it was impoſſible for him to defend it any lōger without
ſome aide from the ſhips, and for to giue them to vnderſtand
of their troubles, there was diſplaide a flagge in
the top of the Factorie: and as ſoone as the ſame was diſcryed
by the Captaine generall, he ſuſpected it in himſelfe to
be that which indéede it was, for the which ſodaine chance
he was very ſorrowfull, for that as then he was but newly
let bloud,Succour ſent by ye Generall Captaine to the Factorie. and ſicke in his bed, and therefore he could not go
himſelfe to ſuccour them: howbeit he ſent Sancho de Toar,
to ſupply his roome, with all the Fléetes boats, which went
with ſuch men as they had, but to reſiſt ſuch a number as
there was of their enimies, they were very few, which Sancho
de Toar perceiuing, durſt not diſimbarke himſelfe, neither
yet come too néere the ſhore leaſt that the enimies ſhuld
come in their Almadias and Tonys, and ſo take them, alſo
that they could not hurt them, they laye ſo farre off from
the ſhore: but they from thence could diſcerne how valyantly
our men did defende themſelues and there entring, although
the number of their enimies did alwayes increaſe,
for ſo it was néedful for ye great flaughter, yt our men made
of thē, from ouer ye wall. Notwithſtanding by meanes therof
their fury did ſo increaſe, yt they cauſed to be brought certain

                     〈◊〉
                   to ouerthrow part of ye wall wtall, which were
ſo great, that our men could not by any meanes defend the
ſame, being ſo few and ſo many hurt, with the enimies arrowes
and ſpeares, which came from them as thicke, as
though it had rained arrowes. But perceiuing once the enimie
began to enter, they would not tarrie there any longer,
but went forth of the Factorye, by a dore that opened toward
the water ſide, where they made reckoning to ſaue
themſelues with their boats. But ye enimies followed them
alwaies ſo narrowly, hurting and killing them, that in this
conflict Aries Correa was ſlaine, ſo that there were lacking
fiftie of our men, betwéene thoſe that were dead and taken
captiues, twentie onely eſcaped, which tooke the water, but
thoſe were ſore hurt, amongſt whome was a Frayer called

Fryer Henricke, and a ſon of the ſaid Aries Correa, which
was but eleuen yeares of age, who is yet aliue and is called
Antonio Correa, and ſince that time hath done in the Indias,
and in other places notable acts of Armes, as in the
fourth booke I ſhall declare. Thoſe that did eſcape, wer taken
into our boates, and carried to the Fléete.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall ſlewe the moſt parte
of thoſe Moores that were aboorde the ten great
ſhips, and then commanded them to be ſet a fire,
& alſo of the great deſtruction which he brought
vpon the citie in reuenge of the death of thoſe
that were ſlaine therein. Cap. 37.
               
                  AFter that theſe newes were brought to
the Captaine generall, he was not onely
very ſorrowfull for the death of thoſe that
were ſlaine, but alſo to ſée how little preuailed
the preſent which he gaue vnto the
King of Calicut, as alſo the taking of the
ſhip, in the which was the Elephant, & now thrée moneths
were paſt that he had bene there, and yet had laden no more
then two ſhips, nor yet could tell when to lade the reſt, fearing
alſo leaſt in Coching he ſhoulde not be well accepted,
for taking of the ſhip in the which was the Elephant. And
further waying with himſelfe, how little or none occaſion
at all there was giuen to vſe ſuch treaſon againſt our men,
he did therefore determine to reuenge himſelfe vpon ye King
of Calycut, if ſo be that he did not vſe ſome excuſe for that
which was paſt, wherevnto if he would willingly yéelde,
then would he be content,The king of Calicut vvas farre off from making a mendes. ſo that he might ther haue his lading.
But the King of Calycut was farre off from the matter,
for he was very glad of that which ye Moores had done,
and commaunded all ſuch Merchaundize to be taken, as
were within the Factorie, the which wer well worth foure

thouſand duckets, & alſo take all ſuch of ours as wer found
aliue for captiues, although they were hurt, of the which
there were foure that died. After all this, the Captaine generall
ſéeing that in all that daye the King of Calicut ſent no
meſſenger to excuſe himſelfe of the fact, he put the matter
in queſtion, wheras it was determined that he forthwith
ſhuld reuenge thoſe iniuries that were paſt, for feare leaſtif
he ſhould delay ſo to doe, that then the King might haue
time to arme his Fléete, which would not then be ſo eaſelye
done. This being determined our men put themſelues in a
readineſſe, to lay aboord x. great ſhips, which lay in y• harbor
full of Moores: theſe at the firſt would haue defended themſelues,Iuſt reuenge vvrought vpon the iniurious Calicuttās
yet for all yt our men did ioyne with them, & fought
with them ſo valyantly, that they brake their order, killing
many of them, and of thoſe that remained ſome leaped into
the water and were drowned, others hid themſelues in their
ſhips, and other were taken aliue, whom the Captaine generall
commaunded to priſon, that they might afterwarde
ſerue for Mariners in the Fléet. The ſhips being thus come
into our mens poſſeſſion, they found within the ſame ſome
Spices and other Merchaundize which were hidden within
them: alſo they found thrée Elephants, which the Captaine
generall commaunded to be killed and ſalted for their victualls,
he commaunded alſo thoſe Moores that were ſlaine to
be told, and there was found of them 600. The ſhips being
diſcharged of all that they had, they wer ſet a fire before all
the Citie, in the ſight of many that came to the water ſide
to ſuccor them, whom being Moores, as they were comming
in their Almadias, our men encountered and fought with
them, but they durſt not goe forward for feare of the ordinaunce.
This was a wonder to thoſe of the Citie, to ſée ten
ſhips burnt together. The King alſo was ſory therefore for
that he could not ſend to ſuccour them. But if that which
was done this day was a wonder to the enimies to behold,
then ye next day was much more to be meruailed at, for the
Captaine generall not being contented with the burning of
theſe ſhips commaunded his ſhips in the night to be brought

as néere the ſhore as he could, the one ſomewhat ſeparated
from the other. They had alſo their boats before them, that
they might reach the moſt part of the Citie. As ſoone as the
morning began to appeare, immediately all the great Ordinaunce
went off amongſt their houſes, which after that the
enimies had ſéene, and how néere our ſhips lay to the ſhore,
they began to ſhoote at thē with ſmal péeces which they had
without hurting any of our men, howbeit of our ordinance,
for that the enimies came running in flockes, there was no
péece that miſt, and by that meanes there were manye that
fell, and the others that drew towards the Citie, where our
ordinaunce alſo had made a great deſtruction, as well in the
Temples of their Gods, as in their dwelling houſes. The
feare was ſo great amongſt the Citizens,The feare that the King of Calicut and the citizens were in. that the King of
Calycut himſelfe was driuen to leaue his Pallaice, and to
goe out of the Citie, for that our men went thether to ſéeke
him out with their pellets, ſo that hard at his héeles they killed
a Nayre, which was a noble man, and ouerthrewe part
of the Kings Pallaice. This deſtruction dured no more but
this daye: and whileſt it was a doing, there appeared two
ſhips yt wer comming to the harbor, which as ſoone as they
had diſcried vs, went their way, & therefore this fight ceaſed.
The Captain generall made after thē wt al his fléet to Panderane,
which is a Port not far off, where there was other
ſeuen néere to the land ready to ſuccour them, in which there
came a multitude of Moores to defend them, and for that our
ſhips could not come néere vnto the ſhore, they lefte them.
And the Captaine generall contenting himſelfe with that
which he had done in Calycut, for that it was verye late to
make his voyage toward Portingal, went toward Coching,
& ther concluded a peace, to ſée whether he might lade ther,
for yt he well knew it, that ther was more Pepper then in
Calicut.
               
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall arriued at the harbour
adioyning to the citie of Coching, & ther he concluded
a peace betweene him & the King, & afterward
began to lade his ſhips. Cap. 37.
               
                  
                  GOing vnder ſaile along by this citie, ye Captaine
generall tooke two ſhips of y• Moores,
which after that they had diſcried our ſhips,
bare as néere the ſhore as they coulde, for
feare of our ſhips, but our men tooke them
and when they were diſcharged of certayne
Rice which they carried, the Generall cauſed them to be ſet
a fire, and ſo following his courſe he ariued at Coching the
xx. of December, which ſtandeth in the Prouince of Malabar,
xix. leagues from that parte of Calycut, going into the
South,Coching ſtandeth in 9. degrees, and the ſcituatiō therof. and being in ix. degrées toward the North. The ſcituation
therof is along the riuer, in the which the Sea doth
enter, by meanes whereof the Citie ſtandeth as it
were in an Ilande and that verye ſtrong, for that there
is no comming to it, but by certaine wayes. It hath belonging
vnto it, a goodly great and a ſure Port, which lyeth before
the mouth of this riuer. The land round about is watry
and low, and made into Ilands: they haue ſmal ſtore of
victuals, but for all that thoſe which they haue is very freſh.
This Citie is buylded much after the manner of Calycut,
and is inhabited by Gentiles and ſundry Moores ſtrangers,
which are come thether from manye places, and are great
Merchaunts, amongſt whom there are two that haue fiftie
ſhippes a péece.
               In this Countrey is great ſtore of Pepper, and the moſt
parte that they haue in Calycut commeth from thence.
But foraſmuch as in Calycut there are more ſtore of Merchaunts
which come from other places, therefore the ſame
is richer then Coching. The King is a Gentile, and is
of the behauiour and propertie of the King of Calycut:
howbeit he is verye poore, by reaſon his Countrey is but
ſmall, neither can he commaund any money to be coined in
his Citie.
               The Kings of Coching are in great ſubiection to the
Kings of Calicut, for as often as ther chanceth a new king to

ſuccéede in Calycut, he immediately goeth to Coching, and
diſpoſſeſſeth him that hath the ſame, of the whole kingdome
and taketh poſſeſſion himſelfe therof, ſo that by this meanes
it lyeth in his hands, whether he will reſtore that King to
the crowne againe or not. Alſo the King of Coching is
bound to aide and accompany the King of Calycut in battaile
againſt any other King, alſo he is bounde to dye in the
religion of the King of Calicut. The Captaine generall, being
come to this harbour, did there let fall his Ankor, for
that he was afearde to ſend Gaſpar with a meſſage to the
king, leaſt he would runne awaye, he chooſed rather to ſend
one whoſe name was Michael Iogue, which although hée
were a Gentile & a ſtraunger, yet he came vnto our Fléete,
with intent to turne Chriſtian, ſaieng that he would goe for
Portingale: wherevpon the Captaine generall tooke occaſion
to baptize him,A Moore baptiſed & called Michael. and gaue him the name of Michael, & for
his ſurname as he was called before. By this man he ſent
to ye king of Coching his meſſage, certifieng him of all that
they had paſt in Calicut, & alſo y• the Captain generall had
brought wt him great ſtore of Merchandize to giue in trucke
for ſuch commodities as there were in Coching, with the
which if ſo be that the King wer not contented, that then he
would buy the ſame for ready mony, wherof he had brought
with him great ſtore, and therefore his requeſt was that in
trucke of his merchandize, or for his ready money he would
giue him lading for foure ſhips. The anſwere that the king
made to this meſſenger, was, That he was very glad of his
comming to this his Port, for that he was wel informed of
his ſtrength and valiantneſſe, and therfore he eſtéemed them
all the better, as héereafter he ſhould well perceiue. And as
for ſuch Spices as he had there, he would giue him ye ſame
in trucke of his Merchaundize y• he had brought with him
from Portingale, or els for money as he ſhould thinke beſt.
And alſo that without any feare he might ſend a land whom
he ſhould thinke good to prouide the ſaid lading, & for the aſſurance
of ſuch as ſhuld trauel about ye ſame he ſent him 2. of
y• principal Naires in pledge, vpō cōditiō yt euery day he ſhuld

chaunge them and take others, for that all ſuch as did féede
a ſea boorde, could not come anye more in the kings preſence.
The Captaine Generall was well contented therewith,
who had the ſending of thoſe pleadges ſo quietly a
boord, for a good beginning, and therfore he ſent immediatly
for Factor of this lading Gonſallo Gilbarboſa, which
was ſent before with Aries Correa, and for his Scriuenor
he ſent Larenco Moreno, and for Interpretour one called
Maderade Alcuſia. Alſo the Captaine Generall commaunded
to be deliuered vnto them and to ſerue them in
all kinde of affaires, foure baniſhed men.
               The king hauing notice of the comming of the Factor
a land, ſent to receiue him the Rogedor of the Citie, who
went accompanyed with many noble men of the Courte,
who brought them before the king. This king euen as his
rents did farre differ in value from the king of Calycuts,
ſo he did alſo differ very much in his eſtate, not onely for ye
furniture of his perſon, but alſo of the place in the which
he was in. For there appeared nothing elſe but the verye
bare walls. The king himſelfe was ſitting within certeine
grates, made much lyke a Theatre, with the which the
whole houſe was compaſſed aboute,The king of Coching much inferior in vvealth & ſtate to ye king of Calycut. and there was
attending vppon him verie few men. The Factor béeing
come before the king, did preſent vnto him a preſent which
the Captaine Generall ſent him, which was a Baſon of
ſiluer to waſh his hands in, full of Saforne, and a greate
Ewer of ſiluer full of roſe water, beſides certeine braunches
of Corall, this preſent the king receiued very ioyfulfully,
giuing vnto the Captaine Generall great thanks for
the ſame, and after that he had talked a while with the factor,
and with Larenco Moreno, he commaunded them to
be lodged, and ſo there remained thoſe thrée a land, beſides
the other foure baniſhed men. But the Captaine Generall
would not conſent there ſhould remaine a land anye more,
for he iudged that the fewer ther remained a land, the fewer
would be loſt if ſo be that there ſhould chaunce the lyke
miſfortune to that which did in Calycut. Howbeit that was

farre vnlike, for yt the king of Coching ſéemed to be a man
inclined to vertue & all the loialtie in the world, which wel
appeared in his fauour, & in the vſing of our men, & in the
diſpatch he made for the lading of our ſhips with ſpices, &
in the commanding of helpe to be giuen by thoſe of y• countrie,
which they did ſo willingly and with ſo great a zeale,
that the ſame ſéemed to be ordeined of God, that the trade
might be brought from Calycut to Coching, & that his holy
Catholike faith might increaſe in the Indias, as ye ſame
did, beſides the eſtate of ye king of Portingale, which might
increaſe alſo in riches as the ſame hath done.
            
            
               Hovv the Captaine General being at Coching, ther came vnto him
a Prieſt vvhich vvas an Indian and a chriſtian, from the citie of
Grangalor, to go vvith him to Portingale, and alſo vvhat els he
tolde him of the chriſtians of this citie. Chap. 39
               
                  THe Captaine Generall béeing in this citie & laden,
there came vnto him two Indians which as they
ſaid were chriſtians, & naturally borne in ye citie of
Grangalor, which is hard by Coching, theſe were
brothers, & were deſirous to go to Portingale, & frō thence
to Rome to ſée the Pope, & afterward to Ieruſalem to viſit
ye holy ſepulchre. And being demanded by ye Captaine generall
what city y• 
                  Grangalor was, & whether the ſame was
only inhabited by chriſtians, & alſo whether they do eſtéeme
ye chriſtiā order of y• Gréeks, or of ye church of Rome: one of
thē made anſwere, y• 
                  Grangalor was a gret city in ye prouince
of Malabar, ſtāding wtin ye coūtry at ye end of a riuer
which cōpaſſeth ye ſame, by ſome parts ye inhabitāts therof,
ſaith he, are both Gētiles & chriſtiās, alſo ther dwel amōgſt
thē many Iewes which are ſmally eſtéemed of, ther are alſo
many ſtrangers amongſt thē,The diſcriptiō & ſtate of Grāgalor. which are merchants of Surria,
of Aegipt, of Perſia, & Arabia, by reaſon of ye great ſtore
of pepper which is there gathered, this citie hath a king amongſt
thēſelues, vnto whō al ſuch chriſtians as dwel wtin
this citie do pay certein tribute, & theſe dwel by thēſelues,
where they haue their church made after our order, ſauing
they haue not in thē any Images of ſaints, but only certein
croſſes: they do not vſe bels, but when ye prieſts would haue

thē come to diuine ſeruice, thē they do obſerue y• order of y•
Gréeks. The chriſtiās haue their Popes which haue 12. cardinals,
& two patriaks, & many Biſhops & Archbiſhops, all
which do reſide in Armenia, for thether go ye biſhops of Grā
                     galor
to receiue their dignity, he himſelf had ben ther wt a
biſhop which ye pope did conſecrate, & he himſelf receiued at
his hands, orders of prieſthood, & euen ſo he is accuſtomed to
do vnto al others y• are chriſtians in y• 
                  Indias, & in Caitaio
& alſo he is called catholike, & their Tonſura is made wt a
croſſe. Of thoſe two patriarks which they haue, yt one remaineth
in ye 
                  Indias, & ye other in Caitaio, & as for y• biſhops
they are repoſed in cities,Why the chriſtians of ye Indias hath a Pope. as is thought cōuenient. The cauſe
why they haue a pope in thoſe parts hath ben as is thought
by thē, for yt in S. Peters time he being in Antioch, ther aroſe
a great ſciſme of Simon Magus, which was ye occaſiō
y• he was called to Rome to ouerthrow ye ſame, & to help ye
chriſtians which wer in great trouble: and ſéeing y• he muſt
depart frō 
                  Antioch, & for yt the church of y• orient ſhuld not
remaine wtout a ſhepheard, he appointed a vicar to gouern,
who, S. Peter being dead, ſhuld remaine for pope, & thoſe y•
ſuccéeded him ſhuld alwaies aſſiſt him in Armenia, but after
ye Moores entred into Suria & Aſia, & for ye 
                  Armenia remained
alwaies in the chriſtian faith: the Chriſtians did
therfore chuſe to gouerne it by 12. cardinals. Marco Paulo
doth alſo make mentiō of this catholike pope, wher he writeth
of this Armenia, in which he declareth there are two
orders of Chriſtians: the one of thoſe are Neſtorians, the
other Iacobites,
                  The manner of ſhauing their prieſts differing frō ours. their pope is alſo named Iacobite, & is hée
whō they cal ye catholike Ioſeph. Moreouer he told ye Captaine
general y• in Grangalor are prieſts whoſe crowns are
not ſhauen as ours are, but onely in ye midſt of their heads
they leaue certein haires, al y• reſt is ſhauen, & alſo they haue
deacons & ſubdeacons. They conſecrate wt leuened bread &
with wine made of raiſons, for they haue no other in y• coū
                  try.
Their childrē are not baptiſed vntil xl. daies after their
birth, without they be ſickly. Thoſe y• are chriſtians do cō
                  feſſe

dead as we doe.

They doe not vſe the holy Oyle, but in ſtéede of the ſame
they doe bleſſe them, & when that any die, they gather many
of themſelues together, and for the ſpace of viii. daies, they
doe eate abundantly, and afterward they celebrate the obſequies
of the dead. They make their teſtament before they

one whole yeare after, when that they enter in their churches,

ſowre Euangeliſts, whoſe writings they haue in great veneration.
They faſt the Lent and the Aduent with greate
ſolempnitie, and take regard not to breake the ſame, during
this time they doe exerciſe themſelues in praier, & on Eaſter
euen they neither doe eate nor drinke any thing till
the next day. They doe vſe to heare Sermons on holy Friday
at night, they obſerue the day of the reſurrection with
great ſolempnitie, with the two other daies following, and
alſo the ſunday next following, for that Saint Thomas on
that day did put his hands into Chriſts ſide, they do kéepe
it with great ſolempnitie, acknowledging thereby that the
ſame was no fantaſie or dreame. Alſo they kéepe holy with
great deuotion the Aſcention day & Trinitie Sunday, & the
Aſſumption of our lady, hir birth, & Candlemas day, & Chriſtmas
day, & all the Apoſtles & Sundaies, as wel the Chriſtians
as ye Gentiles. And they with great deuotion kéep y• firſt
day of Iuly in the honour of S. Thomas, they could yéelde
no reaſon or cauſe why they doe obſerue that daie. They
haue Fryers of Negroes which doe liue very chaſtly. Alſo
there are Nunnes of the ſame order.Negro friers profeſſing chaſtitie. Their Prieſts doe

                   verye chaſtly, for if ſo be that they doe not ſo, they are
depriued from celebrating. There can be no ſeperating of
the man and woman, but well or ill they muſt liue together
till death doe ſeparate them. They receiue the Sacrament
thrée times in the yeare, they haue amongſt them greate
Doctours, and open ſchooles, in the which are read the Prophets:
and alſo there were in times paſt olde auncient doctors

doctors, which haue left the Scriptures of the olde & newe

Chap. 40.
               
                  THe Captaine Generall being in this harbour,
ther came vnto him a meſſenger frō
the king of Cananor, & alſo from the king
of Coula
                        •
                     
                   (they both being great princes)
in y• kingdome of Malabar, requeſting him
to come to their ports or harbours, for yt
they would giue him ſufficient lading for his ſhips, better
cheape then in Coching, with verye many other offers of
friendſhip. To whom he made anſwere by a meſſenger that
he ſent, yéelding vnto them moſt hearty thanks, certifieng
them y• at this preſent he could not go to lade at their ports,
for that he had begun to take in the ſame already at Coching,
                  A greate Fleete of enimies.
notwithſtanding at his next retourne he wold do ſo,
immediatly after yt he had laden his ſhips, there was ſéene
a ſea boord a fléete of 25. great ſhips, beſides other ſmall veſſels.
And ye king of Coching hauing notice therof, ſent word
forthwith to the Captaine Generall, yt there was in that
fléet xv. thouſand fighting men which came onely to none
other purpoſe, but to ſéeke him out, and therefore if ſo bée

that he ſhould haue any néed of men, to ſend him word, & he
would prouide him therof. The Captaine Generall anſwered,
that as yet he had no ſuch néede, for that with thoſe
few that hée had with him, he truſted in God, to giue them
to vnderſtand, what ill councell they had taken, to come &
ſéeke him out, for that hée had well experimented theyr
ſtrength. Truth it was the Generall beléeued ſteadfaſtlye,
as hée hadde ſpoken, in reſpect of that which hée before
had paſt in the harbour or porte of Calycut. Firſt with
ten great ſhippes which hée founde there, as alſo with certeine
that were there a grounde. And although the enymyes
were ſcouring vp and downe in the Sea, yet therby
it was apparaunt that they durſt not come to the place
where hée was, by a league, for all that they ſhewed themſelues
to be ſet in order to fight. The Captaine Generall
perceiuing theyr intent, cauſed to wey Ankor, and hauing
his Sailes ſpread abroade, departed with all his Fléete
towarde his enimyes, in the which there went thoſe
Pleadges Malabars, which the King of Coching hadde
giuen vnto him. Howbeit his determination was, to retourne
againe to Coching, and ſo to deliuer them.
And going after this ſorte, there fell vppon them on a ſodayne
ſuch a greate ſtorme which came with a contrarye
winde, that hée was faine to retourne and to come to an
Ankor againe, ſo that hée coulde not beare with his enymies.
               The next daye following which was the tenth daye
of Ianuarye. 1501. the winde came about in ſuch ſorte
and ſo large, that the one Fléete might laye the other aboorde.
The Captaine Generall beeing deſirous thereof,
founde vppon a ſodeine miſſing one of his greate
Shippes, in the which went Sancho de Toar, vnto
whome it did well appeare, by reaſon it was night, that
he had forgotten himſelfe. And for becauſe that next vnto
this ſhippe, this was the principalleſt of all the Fléete,
in the which were placed the chiefeſt men, it was not
thought good to fight without him, the tather for that in

the others he hadde but fewe men, and of them the moſt
parte were ſicke, and of the enymyes were ſo manye
as the king of Coching had ſent him worde.
               And as the winde was proſperous to goe forwarde
on his voyage towarde Portingale,
                  He maketh tovvard Portingale. and verye ſcant to
retourne toward Coching, hee departed, making his
courſe into the Sea with his whole Fléete. After whome
the whole Fléete of the enimies followed, all that daye till
it was night, and then they loſt theyr companye, and ſo
retourned. Thus going in his courſe, he beganne to comfort
thoſe Nayres which were deliuered vnto him for
Pleadges, with manye pleaſaunt tales, the which was
the cauſe that they fell to theyr meate, béeing thrée dayes
there, & had eaten nothing of fiue daies of theyr ſailing, and
vpon the xv. of Ianuarie, he came within ſight of Cananor,
which lyeth flat north from Coching, and is in the coaſt of
Malabar, xxxi. leagues from Coching.

are in this Citie many Moores that are great merchants,
which trade in all kinde of merchaundiſe. There is adioyning
vnto this Citie a goodly Baie, but there is in this
Coaſt no great ſtore of Pepper, no more then doth ſerue
their owne turnes. Howbeit they haue greate ſtore of Ginger,Drugs for the Pothecaries.
                  Cardamomon, Tamarindos, Mirabolanos, Canyfiſtola,
and ſuch lyke. There belong vnto this Citie certeine
pooles of water, wherein there do bréed Lagartos, the which
are lyke vnto the Crocodiles that are in the riuer of Nilo,
which are ſo great that they doe eate men, if ſo be that
they maye come by them. Their heads are great, and they
haue two orders of téeth, their breath is as ſwéet as muſke,
and their bodies are couered ouer with ſhels. Alſo about this
citie there are in buſhes great adders, which are very full
of poiſon, ſo that with their breath onely they do kill men:
alſo there are Bats ſo great as kites, which in their heads
doe ſéeme much like vnto a Foxe, hauing ſuch manner of
téeth alſo.
               
                  
Theſe the Gentiles doe féede vpon, for that they are pleaſant
and ſwéete. They haue moreouer in this Citie plentie
both of fiſh, fleſh, & fruits, & as for rice y• commeth vnto thē
from other places. The king is a Gentile, and a Bramene,
hée is counted to be one of the thrée of the prouince of Malabar,
but he is not ſo rich nor of ſo great a power as is the
king of Calycut, nor yet as the king of Coulan. Vnto this
harbour arriued the Captaine General, and came to an ankor,
(not onelye for that the king had requeſted him ſo to
doe) but alſo for that he minded to take in there ſome Cinamon,
whereof hée had none yet a boorde, ſo that there hée
tooke in 400. Quintalls,Euery quintall is 100. vveight. and might haue had much more,
but he would not take it, wherefore it was thought that
he wanted money: wherevpon the king tooke occaſion to
ſend him word, that if ſo be the lacke of money were the
cauſe that he tooke no more thereof, or any other ſpices, hée
was then much to blame, for that hée woulde truſt him
with much more if néede ſo required, vntill hée returned
backe againe, hée or any other. Hée was the willinger to
ſend him this offer, for that he knewe the true dealing of
the Portingale, and howe well they mainteined theyr
promiſe: and for that hée did beare vs ſo greate good will,
the Captaine Generall made him aunſwere, giuing him
greate good thankes for the lyberall offers hée hadde made
him: promiſing that if hée liued, hée woulde enforme the
king his maiſter of the greate good will that hee doth
beare him. And once this, hée maye bée aſſured to haue
him alwayes for his friende. After this was deliuered
vnto him an Embaſſadour, whome
the king of Cananor ſent to the king
of Portingale to increaſe a
further friendſhip betwéene
them.

                  IN the middes of that goulfe, and on the laſt
day of Ianuary, he tooke a great ſhip, richly
laden with Merchandiſe, and perceiuing
that it belonged to the King of Cambaya,
he would not meddle therewith, but rather
ſent him word that his comming to the Indias
was not to make warres with any, but if ſo be that he
minded ſo to doe, it ſhall be with the King of Calycut, for
that he had broken the peace he had made with him: onely
out of that ſhip he tooke a Pilot, for to ſafeconduct him, till
he had paſt the gulfe. And he being in the ſame vnder ſaile,
on a certaine night, which was the xii. of February, they
loſt the ſhip of Sancho de Toar, which in a ſtorme, that roſe
ſodainly vpon them,A ſhip of the fleete caſt avvay being hard by the ſhore ſide, violentlye
they ranne vpon it, by meanes whereof, there was kindled
in the ſame a great fire, ſo that nothing was ſaued, but onely
the men. Following their courſe in this tempeſt, they
paſt by Mylynde, onely for that they could not take harbor
there, nor on any other land but only Monſanbique, which
he tooke in his waye, as well for the want they had of water,
as alſo to new rig their ſhips, for yt they went all open.
               In the meane while he ſent Sancho de Toar, to diſcouer
Sofala, and from thence to retourne towarde Portingale,
with relation thereof. The ſhippes béeing all
in a readineſſe, they returned toward the Cape Buena eſperansa,
and ther by reaſon of another great ſtorme, that ouertooke
them, there was ſhot out of a ſhip a great péece of Ordinaunce,
which ſhip was neuer ſéene after in all that voyage.
After ſo many great and cruell ſtormes, and other great
daungers, which are innumerable to write of, he paſt the
foreſaid Cape, the xxii. of May, which fell on Whitſundaye,

and ſo following their courſe, came to an Ankor at Cabo
Verde,
                  Diego Dias found at Capo Verde, & his voyage. where he found Diego Dias (whoſe company he had
loſt before, when as he went toward the Indias) who was
driuen into the red Sea, where he did winter, and loſt his
boate, and where alſo dyed the moſt part of his men, and for
that his Pilot durſt not venture to carry them to the Indias,
did return toward Portingale. And ſo after that he came
out of the red Sea, what with hunger, thirſt, and othe diſeaſes,
all his men were conſumed ſauing ſeauen perſons:
wherein God of his great goodneſſe ſhewed a miracle, forſomuch
as in many dayes before, they were not able to gouerne
their ſailes, for that they were ſo féeble and weake.
The Captain generall ſéeing that ther came no more ſhips,
departed towards Liſhborne, wherevnto he came the laſt
daye of Iuly in the yeare of our Lord 1501. And after that
he was arriued, in came the ſhip, which ſhot off the péece of
Ordinaunce in the ſtorme, before that he doubled the Cape
Buena eſperansa, and after him came alſo Sancho de Toar,
who went to diſcouer Sofala, and made relation thereof to
be a ſmall Iland,The Ilād of Sofala diſcouered. ſtanding hard to the firme lande, and that

where, as they ſay, there are mynes thereof. And for that
cauſe there goe out of the Indias thether many Moores, that
receiue the ſame in trucke of Merchandize of ſmall valew.
Moreouer he brought with him a Moore, which was giuen
him in pawne of one of his men, which he ſent into ye firme
land for to view the ſame. This Moore gaue large information
thereof, as héereafter I ſhall declare. With this laſt ſhip
there did returne vnto Portingale, of twelue that went for

                  IN this yeare of our Lord 1501. the King of
Portingale ſuppoſing that all contention and
ſtrife in Calycut was finiſhed,The third Fleet that vvent frō Portingal to the Indias & that ye trade
was ſetled as well there as in Quiloa and
Sofala, and for that he had ſent the ſelfe ſame
yeare for that purpoſe one Pedro Aluares:
therefore he thought beſt not to ſend any more then 3. ſhips
& a Caruell, of ye which two caried Merchandize to Sofala, &
the other two to Calycut. Of this Fléete he made Generall
one called Ioan de la Nueua, born in Galyzia, & this charge
was giuen him, for yt he was accōpted to be a valyant Gentleman:
moreouer, Franciſco de Nauoys, Diego, Barboſo, &
Hernando de la pyna, war appointed for his captains. Ther
went in this Fléet no more then lxxx. men. That which the
king had giuen him in commandement to do, was this, that
in his way he ſhould touch at the Ilande of S. Blaze.
                  The order that the king gaue him concerning this voyage. And
being come thether, if it ſhould to chaunce, that he ſhoulde
finde miſſing any of his ſhips, that then he ſhould there remaine
ten dayes, and from thence he ſhould depart toward
Sofala, and being there, if ſo be that ther were ſetled a Factorie,
to diſcharge the Merchandize the which were appointed
for that place. From the which he might haue recourſe
vnto the Indias. And if ſo be that he found not all thing ſo,
that then he ſhould trauell with all diligence, and as much
as in him lay, to ſettle the ſame before he ſhould goe from
thence: which being finiſhed, that then he ſhould leaue for
Factor of that place Aluoro de Braga, with all ſuch Merchandize
as wer appointed, which went in the Caruell. Frō
thence he ſhuld go for Quiloa, & after yt he had bene ther, he
ſhuld kéepe his right courſe toward Calicut. And if ſo bée
that he ſhuld finde ther as yet Pedro Aluares, to know whether
he ſtand in any néed of him, & that he ſhuld obey him as
his general, & wil him to ſettle a factory in Sofala, if it were
not done alredy. This general being departed frō 
                  Liſhborn,
he came ſafely to ye Iland of S. Blaze, wherin a branch of
a trée was foūd a ſhoe, & in ye ſame was a letter which made
mention, ye 
                  Pedro de Tayde captain of ye fléet of Pedro Aluares

Cabral, which was hound to Portingale was paſt by,
and ſo making further relation what had chanced vnto him
in Calycut, and of the good entertainment they had in Coching,
where as then did remaine ſome of our men, and alſo
how the King of Cananor ſhewed himſelfe very curteous.
This as it appeared, was written by Pedro de Tayde, to
aduertiſe all ſuch Captaines as ſhould paſſe by to Calycut.
The Captaine generall with the other Captaines peruſing
this letter, did then determine, yt it was not requiſit, to leaue
the Caruell in Sofala, for that they had but few men, which
was not aboue foure ſcore. And with this they thought it
conuenient to go to Quiloa, where they founde a baniſhed
man, whom Pedro Aluares had left there, who likewiſe informed
the Generall, what Pedro Aluares had paſt in Calicut,
the which he had learned of certaine Moores, and alſo of
the ſhips that he had loſt. From thence he went to Mylinde,
where he talked with the King, which tolde him as much
more as the baniſhed man had done. And hauing the ſame
for certaine,they take their voyage to the Indias. he went ouer to the Coaſt of the Indias, to the
which he came in Nouember, and fell to an Ankor in Anſadina,
where he thought conuenient to take in his water.
And being there arriued, there came in vpon a ſodaine, ſeauen
great ſhippes of Cambaya, which were bounde into the
Straights. The Moores wold haue fought with our fléete,
but our ordinaunce was the cauſe that they durſt not laye
vs aboord, and ſo they went their way. After this, the Captaine
generall departed to Cananor: where he talked with
the King, which certified him of that which had likewiſe
paſt in Calycut with Pedro Aluares, and what he had done,
and how he offered him lading for thoſe ſhips which he had
brought with him. Alſo he certified him, how deſirous hée
was to be at the King of Portingales commaundement: yet
for all theſe faire words, the Captaine generall woulde not
take in there any lading, vntill ſuch time he had ben at Coching
with the Factor, toward which place he departed, and
in his way he tooke a ſhip which appertained vnto ye Moores
of Calycut, the which defended hir ſelfe very valyauntlye,

but afterward he commaunded to ſet the ſame a fire. And
being ariued at Coching, the Factor with the reſt of his cō
                  pany
went to viſite the Captaine generall aboorde his ſhip,
who told him that the King was greatly offended with Pedro
Aluares, for yt he went his way without ſpeking with
him, & for carrieng away his pledges: yet this notwithſtanding,
both he & the reſt of his company wer alwayes curteouſly
entertained. In ye night they wer brought into his pallaice,
yt there they might remaine: & if ſo be yt in ye day they
wer any thing deſirous to walk abroad, then they wer tended
vpon by certain of his Nayres, which were commanded
to attend vpon them, & kéepe them company for feare of the
Moores,The malitiouſneſſe of the Moores. for that they did not loue them, but rather were deſirous
to kill them, inſomuch, that before they went to the
Pallaice, they did one night ſet fire to the houſe, wherein
they did lye: whereof the King hauing knowledge, from
thence foorth he had them to his Pallaice, and ſo commaunded
from that time forwarde the Nayres to take a care of
them. Moreouer, he was told what ill ſales he ſhoulde finde
there of ſuch Merchaundize as he had brought, for that the
Moores had perſwaded the Merchaunts of the Countrey to
giue lyttle for the ſame: and alſo aduiſed thoſe that ſell the
Pepper and other Spices, that they ſhould not ſell the ſame
but for ready money, and not in trucke of Merchaundize: &
therefore they tolde him that if ſo be he had brought no money
to buye their Spices withall, that then he ſhould make
no reckoning of the ſame. And therefore for that the Generall
had brought none, he would tarrie there no longer,
but returned to Cananor, to take in there his lading, where
the King was ſo great a friend to the King of Portingale,
that when he vnderſtood, that he had brought no money, he
remained his ſuretie for a thouſand Quintall of Pepper, &
for fiftie of Ginger,Euerye Quintall is a 100. vvaight. & for foure hundred & fiftie Quintall of
Cinamon: beſides ſome linnen cloath, which is made of Algadon,
vntill ſuch time he had made ſales of all ſuch Merchandize
as he had brought with him, which he had lefte in
Cananor, in the hands of a Factor & two Scriuenors, and ſo

from thence he ſhould returne with the firſt winde, y• which
as then did begin to blow, and therefore he would tarry no
longer. To the intent therefore they ſhuld not depart without
their lading, he ſhewed the Captaine generall this pleaſure.
The Captaine generall ſeeing this his curteous dealing,
did commend vnto his cuſtodie certaine of his men, the
which he left with him, for that he had ſent with Pedro Aluares
Cabral Embaſſadors to Portingale. This lading béeing
taken in, then on the xv. of December, ther did appeare
in the Sea lxxx. Paraos, which were paſt the Mount Dely.
Whereof the King hauing knowledge, he ſent word immediately
to the Captaine generall, that thoſe were the Fléete
of Calycut, that came onely to ſet vpon him, and therefore
it were good he ſhuld command his men to diſimbark themſelues
& their ordinance:The king of Calicut ſent lxxx. Paraos to fight with ye captain generall vnto which ye captain general made
aunſwere, that he would not ſo doe. For if ſo be that the
enimies came with that intent, he had a hope in God yt he
ſhould be able to defend himſelfe: and with that he put himſelfe
in a readineſſe. The next day following, which was the
xvi. day of December, before y• dawning of y• day, ther was
come into the Bay to the number of 100. ſhips and Paraos,
which wer all full of Moores, béeing ſent of purpoſe, for that
the King of Calicut was informed, that they were there taking
in of their lading, ſo that he thought by that meanes
that neither ſhip nor man ſhould eſcape, and therefore they
lay as they did about the Baye. As ſoone as the Captaine
generall had viewed them, he remoued from the place wher
he was at an Ankor, and brought himſelfe into the middes
of the Baye, leauing order with his ſhips, that they ſhould
lay on loād with their ordinaunce which they had, with the
which he commaunded them foorthwith to begin to ſhoot off:
which was done in ſuch ſort, that they did neuer ceaſe. And
if ſo be that he had not done ſo, doubtleſſe the enimies wold
haue laid their ſhips aboord, by reaſon there were ſo manye:
So that it was vnpoſſible for him to eſcape, if God of his
goodneſſe had not fauoured him, and prouided by his mercie,
that the enimies brought no Ordinaunce with them.

Wherefore they were the bolder to diſpend amongſt them
their ſhot, with the which there were many very ſore hurt,
ouer and beſides great numbers that were ſlaine, and their
ſhips and Paraos ſunke, for they durſt not venter to lay our
ſhips aboord, nor yet had killed or hurt any of our men. The
fight dured vntill ſuch time it was Sunne ſet, then the enimies
helde vp a flagge. But, for that he feared they meant
thereby ſome deceipt, he did not leaue off ſhooting: for otherwiſe
they might haue thought he had ſo done, for yt he was
wearied, or els for feare. But it was nothing ſo, for they did
it for the deſire they had of peace, in reſpect of the hurt and
loſſe of their men,This flag was a ſign & requeſt of peace. which they had receiued at our mens
hands, whereby they were driuen to ſuch neceſſitie, that if
ſo be that the winde had ſerued, they had hoyſed vp theyr
ſayles and gone theyr way, and therefore they kept vp their
flagge. The Captaine generall perceiuing their meaning,
(and for that the moſt part of his Ordinaunce was broken,
with the continuall ſhooting thereof, did anſwere them with
another flagge, which was done by the councell and conſent
of the other Captaines: and immediatelye vppon the ſame,
they ſent a Moore, which came in a ſmall Boate vnto him,
whoſe meſſage was, to demand peace till the next day, which
was by him graunted, with this condition, that they ſhould
tarrie no longer in the Baye, but go into the open Sea, & ſo
they did. The generall (although ye wind was partly againſt
him) made likewiſe his courſe into the Sea, although it wer
troubleſome vnto him. The Moores could not doe the lyke,
for their ſhippes and Paraos can beare no ſayle but with a
forewinde. Yet for all the trouble that was paſt, the Generall
came to an Ankor hard by them, and for all that he vſed
in the night a great and vigilant watch, by the which they
hearde the enimies rowing in their boates towardes our
Fléete, yet before that they were knowen, they wer almoſt
vpon him: their intent as it was preſuppoſed, was to ſet our
Fléete a fire. The Captaine Generall fearing this, commaunded
to vyere more of the Cabells, that he might bée
the farther off from them.
               
                  
And perceiuing that the enimies did yet followe them, he
then commanded a péece to be ſhot of at them, with y• which
they were afeard, & ſo went their way: & as ye wind came of
the ſhore ſomwhat faire, they hoyſed vp their ſailes, and followed
their courſe toward Calicut. The Captaine generall
gaue God great thanks, yt he had ſo deliuered him from his
enimies, & ſo taking his leaue of the King of Cananor, departed
toward Portingale,
                  they ariue ſafelye at Portingal where he arriued in ſafetie with
all his ſhips. After that he was departed, there came to Cananor
one of his men, called Gonſallo Pixoto, which was
taken in Calicut for Captiue, whome the King ſent with a
meſſenger to the Captaine generall. The effect thereof was,
excuſing himſelfe of all that was done vnto Pedro Aluares,
and further alſo what hurt he had done vnto his Fléete in
Cananor. Moreouer, he offered him, if ſo be that he would
come to Calycut, to giue him his full lading of Spices, and
ſufficient Pledges for the aſſuraunce of the ſame.

Gil Hernand, couſin to Larenco de la Mina, Iuan Lopes
Pereſtrelo, Rodrigo de Caſteneda, Rodrigo de Abreo and
of the caruells, Pedro Raphael & Diego Peres. They carryed
alſo a Caruell vnwrought, which they ſhoulde make
an ende of in Monſanbique, of the which there ſhoulde
goe for Captaine one called Hernand Rodrignes Badarſas:
beſides this xv. ſaile ther remained making in a redines
other fiue ſhips, of the which there ſhould go for Captaine
generall, one Steuen de la Gama, who departed the fift day
of May, next after following. After that the Captaine generall
had doubled the Cape of Buena Eſperansa with his
whole fléete, béeing at the furtheſt end of the currents, hée
ſent the ſame to Monſanbique, to remaine there whileſt
hée went to Sofala, according as he was commaunded by
the king. He carried in his companie foure of the ſmalleſt
ſhippes of the whole Fléete. His going thether was
not onely to ſée the ſcituation of the ſame,He goeth firſt to Sofala to regrate their golde. and to ſée whether
there were any place conuenient there for to make a
fort, but alſo for to regrate their gold, and this was done in
xxv. dayes. The frindſhip betwéene the king of Sofala and
him, was agréed vpon, and that he might from thence forth
ſettle the factorie there. After that this was ended, there
paſſed betwéens them ſundrie preſents from the one to the
other. And hauing concluded, the Captaine generall departed
from thence, and retourned to Monſanbique, and in
going out of the riuer there was loſt one of the ſhips, but
the men were all ſaued. Being arriued at Monſanbique he
immediatly renewed with the gouernour the olde friendſhip
which in times paſt had bene betwéene them, and by
his condeſent was left there a factor, which was deliuered
vnto him with other more of our men, which remained in
the Factorie for no other purpoſe but to prouide alwaies
victualls for ſuch Fléetes as ſhould touch there,A houſe apointed for the Factory. either going
or comming from the Indias. This béeing finiſhed, &
hauing made an end of the Caruell with all his ordinance
placed, he departed toward Quiloa, with intent to bring

him to be tributarie to the king of Portingale, the order
whereof he carryed with him in his Regiſter, which hée
meant to put in execution, by reaſon of the euill interteinment
he gaue to Pedro de Aluares Cabrall. And beeing
come to this harbour or port, the king went to viſit him,
a ſeaboord, which hée did onely for the feare that he was in,
for the iniurie which he had done to Pedro Aluares. After
that he was come thether, there arriued alſo Steuen de la
Gama, that came with other fiue ſhips, which he departed
withall out of Portingale. Now when the Captaine Generall
eſtéemed the king but for a lyar, and had got him a
ſeaboorde, he would not truſt him on his promiſe any further,
but did immediatly threaten him, that if ſo be that hée
would not pay tribute to the king of Portingale, he would
commaund him to priſon, vnder the hatches of his ſhippe.
With the feare héereof, he promiſed to giue him yéerely two
thouſand Miticaes of gold, and for the aſſurance of the paiment
thereof, he gaue in pledge a principall Moore, whome
they doe call Mafamede Aleones, one whome he hated, for
that he was a feard leaſt he wold take the kingdome from
him, for that he himſelfe hadde vſurped the ſame from the
right king. After that he ſawe himſelfe at libertie, and in
the citie, he woulde not according to his promiſe ſend his
tribute, but rather hoped that the Captaine Generall wold
haue cauſed the pleadge to be killed, by reaſon whereof
he ſhould be ridde of an enimie. But the Moore, ſéeing that
the tribute came not, was faine to pay the ſame himſelfe,
and therevpon the Captaine Generall did deliuer him.

               THis being done, the Captaine Generall, went forward
on his voyage, toward Mylynde, where hée
ſtaide to take in his water, and to ſée the king: and

from thence he kepte his courſe towarde the Indias, and
at the mount Dely,

that was bound to Calycut, which was taken by our
men, for that they did defende themſelues verie ſtoutlye.
               The ſhippe béeing rendered, the Captaine Generall went
a boorde the ſame, where he commaunded to come before
him the owners thereof, and all the principalleſt Moores
that were more there. He willed them alſo to bring with
them all ſuch kinde of merchaundiſe as they had, threatening
them that if they did it not, he woulde cauſe them to
be throwen into the ſea. They aunſwered him that they
had nothing, for that all theyr goods were in Calycut. The
Captaine Generall ſhewed himſelfe to bée offended with
that aunſwere, and did therefore commaunde one of them
to be throwne into the ſea, bound hand and foot. The others
with the feare they had conceiued to ſée this puniſhment,
did deliuer all that they had, which was much, and that very
good merchaundiſe, which was immediatly commaunded
to be deliuered vnto Diego Hernando Correa, that went
for Factor to Coching, and ſo he gaue order that the ſame
ſhould be carryed a boorde another ſhippe.
               All the children which were a boorde the ſayde ſhippe,
were carryed aboorde the Generall, for that he had made
promiſe to make them all Friers, and to place them in
our Ladyes Church of Belem, as afterwarde he did.
The reſt of the merchaundiſe which were of the meaner
ſorte, and of ſmall value, hée gaue the ſpoyle of them
to his men. The ſhippe béeing vnladen of the goods, commaundement
was giuen to Steuen de la Gama, to ſet the
ſame a fire. This was done after that the Moores were
driuen vnder the Hatches, to reuenge the death of thoſe
that were ſlaine in Calycut.
               
               This ſhippe béeing ſette a fire, by the foreſayde Steuen
de la Gama, and other two, they leaped then into their
Boates, leauing the ſhippe burning. The Moores
that were within the ſame, after that they perceyued

the Shippe to burne, did breake open the hatches: by
meanes whereof they were ſet at libertie: and with the water
the ſhip had within it did quench the fire. The Captain
Generall ſéeing this, forthwith commaunded Steuen de la
Gama to goe once more, and laye the ſame aboorde, to the
which he went with ſundry of his men, with their wepons.
Howbeit the Moores did defende themſelues as deſperate
men,Deſperate minds in time of extremitie. not fearing death. Some there were of them that
tooke firebrands and threw the ſame into one of the ſhips,
with determination to ſet the ſame a fire. Others y• threw
the like at their heads. And for that the night drew on,
they left them there, becauſe the Captaine Generall was
not of that minde, they ſhould remaine there in the darke,
for feare leaſt the Moores ſhould kill ſome of our men.
Howbeit he gaue commaundement, that the foreſaid ſhippe
ſhoulde be watched, that the Moores ſhoulde not runne to
lande, which was hard by. The Moores all that night did
nothing elſe but crie out to Mahoma to ſuccour and deliuer
them from vs. The dawning of the day béeing come,
the Captaine Generall commaunded once more that Steuen
de la Gama with ſome of the Marriners of his ſhippe
ſhould goe and lay the Moores ſhip a boord, and ſet the ſame
a fire againe, which was ſo done. Now after that he hadde
made the Moores to flie and to ioyne themſelues in the
poope of their ſhip, fighting alwaies with them, notwithſtanding
the which, certeine of his Marriners and Gunners
would not leaue them vntill ſuch time the ſhip was
halfe burnt. When the Moores ſawe the fire, ſome there
were that leaped into the ſea with hatchets in their hands,
which they carried ſwimming, with determination to kill
all thoſe that did purſue them with boats, whom lyke wild
men deſperately bent they did ſet vppon. Yet for all that
there were many that were hurt, for that they came néere
to our boates ſide. Howebeit the moſt parte of them was
ſlaine, and thoſe that remained in the Shippe were drowned,
within the ſame, for that the ſhip did ſinke. There
were of them in all thrée hundred, whereof there was not

one that did eſcape: and of our men there were ſome that
were hurt.
            
            
               How the Captaine Generall made peace and friendſhip
with the king of Cananor, and afterwarde
departed toward Calycut. Chap. 45.
               
                  FRom hence went the Captaine
Generall to Cananor,
                  An embaſſadour ſet to ye king of Cananor. and being
come thether to an ankor, he ſent
ye Embaſſador which he brought
with him for the king, who told
him that he was come, and that
his deſire was to ſpeake with
him. The king héerevpon commaunded
to be made a bridge of
Timber, which entered into the
water as farre as it was poſſible. The ſame was couered
ouer with Carpets, and other rich clothes, and vpon it toward
the lande ſide, was framed a houſe lykewyſe made
of timber,The meeting of ye king and the Captaine Generall at Cananor 1502. couered ouer as the bridge afore ſayd, which was
made for the méeting of the king and the Captaine Generall.
The king beeing the firſt that was come, came accompanyed
with ten thouſand Nayres, and with many Trumpets,
and other inſtrumentes, which went ſounding and
playeng before him. After that the king was entered into
this houſe, there were placed the Nayres on the Bridge,
thoſe that were appointed to receiue the Captaine Generall.
Who ſtanding there, anone came the Generall in his
Boate accompanied with all the Boates of the fléete, béeing
richly couered ouer and ſet out with theyr Flagges, beſides
that, they carryed certeine Ordinaunce in the proer
of theyr Boates. Alſo there were many Drummes and
Trumpets with them, and with ſhooting of the Ordinance
the Captaine Generall diſimbarked himſelfe, being accompanied
with all his Captaines, and with ſundry of his
men, which went all armed.

fléet in his port or harbour, by ye which he feared to receiue
There were carried before him two great Baſons of ſiluer
and gilt, which were to waſh his hands in, couered ouer
with fine péeces of Corall, and other fine things which they
doe greatly eſtéeme in the Indias. the Nayres viewing
the ſame, did meruaile to ſée the delicatneſſe of our
men.
               With this the king came as farre forth to receiue the captaine
generall as the gate of his place,The preſēt vvhich the king of Portingale ſent ye king of Cananor. where he imbraced
him, and afterwarde they returned together to the place
from whence the king came forth, where the Captaine generall
had commaunded to be ſet a couple of chaires, vpon
the which, although it was not the kings cuſtome to ſit,
yet he did at that time for the Captaine Generalls ſake. At
this preſent was concluded the friendſhip betwéene the king
of Portingale and him, ſo that immediatly after that the
Factorie was ſetled in Coching, minding to doe the lyke
in Cananor, where as ſoone as the ſame was done, he wold
lade certeine of his ſhippes, and after all this the Captaine
Generall departed toward Calycut.
               
            
            
               How the Captaine Generall came to the port of
Calycut, and what hee did there. Chap. 46.
               
                  FRom hence the Captaine Generall
béeing come to the harbour
of Calycut, afore they
were knowne, did take certaine
Paraos in the which were to
the number of fiftye Malabars,
that could not eſcape. The Captaine
Generall would not at the
firſt comming doe the citie any
hurt with his ordinaunce, vntill
ſuch time he hadde ſéene whether the king woulde ſend

him any meſſenger or not. And tarrieng for the ſame, there
came a boorde him, a boate with a Flag in the ſame, in the
which there was a Frier of the order of Saint Fraunces,
whome after that our men had ſight of him, they iudged
to be one of thoſe that were in the company of Aries
Correa, & remained captiue. This frier being entred into the
ſhip, ſaid Deo gracias, by the ſame he was knowne to be a
Moore, howbeit to excuſe himſelfe he ſaid that he came after
that ſort, that they might the rather conſent vnto his comming
a boorde, being ſent with a meſſage from the king
to the Captaine Generall, about the ſetteling of a trade
in Calicut. Vnto this the Captaine generall made aunſwere,
commaunding him not to ſpeake thereof, vntill
ſuch time the king had ſatiſfied him for all that he had taken
in the Factory, when he conſented to the death of Aries
Correa, and the others that were with him. In this matter
they ſpent three daies with meſſages to & fro, without
anye concluſion, for that the Moores did withſtande the
ſame.
               The Captaine general perceiuing yt all theſe delaies were
but lies to ſpend the time, he ſent him then word that hée
minded not to tarrie for anſwere any longer then noone, &
the ſame to be with effect, and to complie with him, or elſe
he would make him moſt cruell warre, with fire & ſwoord,
and that forthwith he wold begin it vpon ſuch his ſubiects
as he had taken priſoners. And becauſe the king ſhould not
thinke them to be words onely, he commaunded to bring
him a running glaſſe of an houre, and therevppon he tolde
the Moore that went with the meſſage, that of thoſe Glaſſes
there ſhould runne ſo many,The Moores make him keepe no promiſe vvith the Capteine Generall, nor feare his povver and as ſoone as they were
ended, without any further delay he would commaund all
that to be done, which he had ſent him word off. But all
this could not moue the king to performe anye thing that
he had promiſed, he was ſo inconſtant and giuen to change,
with euerye vaine ſaieng of the Moores: and the outward
ſhew that hée made of peace, was but feigned, by reaſon
of the feare hée had conceiued in himſelfe, to ſée ſo greate a

fléet in his port or harbour, by the which he feared to receiue
great loſſe, whereof the Moores did aſſure him the contrarye,
which was the occaſion that he kepte no promiſe.
Vpon this the Captaine generall as ſoone as the time was
come, commaunded to bée ſhotte off a péece, which was the
ſigne he gaue to the other Captaines, to commaund thoſe
Malabars to bée hanged, which were departed amongſt the
Fléete. After that they were executed, he commaunded
their féete and handes to bée out off, which were throwne
into a Parao and ſent a ſhoare with two Boates well armed,
and a Letter for the king of Calycut written in the
Arabian tongue, in ye which hée ſignified vnto him yt in ſuch
manner, he would paye him for all his faigned lyes which
he had ſpoken vnto this preſent. And as for his kinges
goods, which he did deteine in his hands, he woulde recouer
them a hundred folde. After all this, he gaue commandement,
that in the night there ſhuld be brought thrée ſhips
as néere to the ſhoare as they could, that the next day without
ceaſing there ſhould be ſhot all the great Ordinaunce
that they had at the Citie, with the which there was great
hurt done, beſides the kings houſe which was ouerthrown
therewith, and ſundrie other houſes of the principall inhabitaunts.
This being done, he departed towarde Coching,
leauing to kéepe that Coaſt ſixe ſhippes which were well
appointed, of the which was named for Captaine Generall
one called Vincente Sodre, to remaine with them in
the Indias, that therewith he might goe and diſcouer the
ſtraights of Meca, and the coaſt of Cambaia.
               
            
            
               How the Captaine Generall came to Coching, and
what he did there, & alſo how the king of Calycut
ſent to traine him thether, for that there
hee would traiterouſly haue taken him, and laſt
of all he wrote a Letter to the king of Coching.
Chap. 47.
               
                  
                  THe Captaine generall béeing come to the
Port or Harbour of Coching, when y• king
had notice thereof, hée ſent him before hee
came a land, certaine Pleadges to remaine
in the ſhip for his aſſurance. And afterward
he came in perſon and met him. In this
viſitation the King did delyuer vnto him Steuen Gyl, with
all the others that remained in his Countrey, and in recompence
of that, the Captaine generall deliuered him a letter,
which the King of Portingale had ſent him, rendring vnto
him moſt hartie thankes, for the good will he alwaies ſhewed
to Pedro Aluares Cabral: and that he was well pleaſed
and contented, to haue a Factory ſetteled in Coching. Alſo
there was deliuered vnto him a Preſent,The king of Portingales preſent ſēt to the king of Coching. which ye King his
Maſter had ſent him: which was a rich Crowne of gold, full
of Iewells, a Cholar of golde all inameld, two Fountaines
of ſiluer wrought, two Arras clothes of Imagery worke, a
coſtly Pauilion, a péece of crimſon Satten, and another of
Sendall, all which ye King did receiue with great pleaſure.
And for yt he vnderſtood not wherefore euery of theſe things
ſerued, he requeſted to be informed of the ſame. And therefore
the Captaine generall commaunded the Pauilion or
Tent to be armed, in the which was concluded a further
peace. Alſo he gaue him a houſe to ſettle therein the Factorie.
Moreouer, the price was agréed vpon, how he would deliuer
the Spices & Drugs that were gathered in his country:
of all theſe things ther was a contract made & ſet down,
which was confirmed by the King. And for a further aſſurance
therof, the King of Coching, ſent to the King of Portingale
a Preſent,The king of Coching preſent ſet to the king of Portingale. which was two Bracelets of golde, ſet
with ſtones, a towell which the Moores doe vſe of cloath of
ſiluer, which was two yeards & a halfe of length, two great
péeces of linnen Cloth, which they doe call Bengala, made of
Cotten wooll, which was excellent fine, a ſtone of the bignes
of a walnut, which they doe take out of the head of a beaſt:
they call the ſame in the Indias, Bulgoldolf, of the which

there are but few found, and theſe are good againſt all poyſon.
The houſe in the which they determined to ſettle their
Factorie being graunted, poſſeſſion thereof was immediately
taken by Diego Hernandus, and other two which were
Notaries: the one was called Lorenso Moreno, & the other
Aluoro vas with others. Whiles the Captaine generalls
ſhip was taking in of his lading, there came a meſſenger
from the King of Calycut vnto him, ſieng: that if ſo bée
that he would retourne to Calycut, he woulde reſtore vnto
him all that had bene taken from him, and that he ſhoulde
ſettle a Trade there. The Captaine generall, after that hée
had conſidered vpon the meſſage,This meſſēger was one of his chief chaplaines. commaunded the meſſenger
to priſon, for this intent, to reuenge himſelfe on him, if
ſo be that the King did lye, ſince he had ſo oftentimes deceiued
him. And being now determined to goe towarde Calycut,
which was more to ſée whether that he coulde recouer
the Merchaundize that were taken, then for anye hope hée
had of the Kings friendſhip, would for that cauſe go alone,
leauing behinde him for his Lieuetenaunt, Steuen de la
Gama. The Captaines that remained were ſore againſt his
going alone, and eſpecially after that ſort, for feare of miſchaunce:
yet he would not be perſwaded but to goe, ſaieng
that along that Coaſt there was Vincente Sodre with the
other ſhips, that were appointed to remaine in the Indias:
and if ſo be that he were driuen to any neceſſitie, hée would
ioyne with them. As ſoone as the king was informed that
he was come to Calycut, he ſent him immediatly word, that
the next day he would comply with him for all ſuch goods,
as had bene taken from Pedro Aluares, and afterwarde hée
would renue the Trade, and ſettle the Factorie. But contrarie
to theſe his wordes, as ſoone as he had knowledge
that the Captaine generall was come alone, vpon a ſodayne
he commaunded to be made in a readineſſe xxxiiii. Paraos,
with intent to ſet vpon him, & ſo to take him if it were poſſible.
And indéed with ſuch a ſodaine came vpon him, that
to eſcape them, he was fain to cut one of his Cables, which
he had out, and ſo made ſaile. And as the winde was of the

land, he went ſomewhat further off from thoſe Paraos, yet
for all that they did not giue him ouer, but alwaies followed
him with ſuch a vehemencie, that hadde it not bene for
Vincente Sodre and the others which kept along yt Coaſt,
he had bene taken, but yet at length they were fame to run
their way. Being thus eſcaped, he retourned to Coching, &
as ſoone as he came thether he commanded the meſſenger to
be hanged, whom the King of Calycut had ſent vnto him:
for the which déed hée remained greatly afrighted, when the
ſame came to his knowledge. But ſéeing now that by no
means he could take him, he determined then to proue, whether
he could perſwade the King of Coching to giue him no
lading, and alſo not to conſent to any Factory for him in his
Countrey.
            
            
               How the Moores were the principall doers heerein,
that mooued the King to write concerning that
matter by one of his Chaplaines to the King of
Coching after this manner.
               
                  I Doe vnderſtand that thou fauoureſt Chriſtians,The king of Calycuts letter to ye king of Coching
and that thou haſt receiued them into
thy Citie, & there doſt giue them both lading
& victualls. It is poſſible thou doſt not
foreſée what daūger may inſue therof, & alſo
how much thou doſt diſpleſure me. I do requeſt
thée yt thou remember what great friends we haue ben
till this preſent, & now thou doſt procure my diſpleaſure, in
eſpeciall for ſo ſmall a matter, as is ye maintaining of thoſe
Chriſtians, which are théeues, yt accuſtome to rob in other
mens Countries. From henceforth my requeſt is, yt thou do
not receiue them, neither yet giue them ſpices: in the which
thou ſhalt not onely ſhew me pleaſure, but alſo binde me to
requit thy good will in what thou ſhalt command. I wil not
now further requeſt ye ſame, for I beléeue thou wilt do it wt 
out further intretie, as I wold for thée in any matter of importance.
This letter being peruſed by the king of Coching,
who was honeſt & true in al his delings, he was not moued

therewith, but aunſwered the King of Calycut, after this
ſort.
               I Cannot well tell how it can be done,The aunſvvere of the king of Coching to the king of Calycuts letter being a matter of
ſo great a waight, as is to put out of my Citie thoſe
Chriſtians, hauing receiued them vpon my word: and to do
it ſo eaſily as thou doeſt write. I will neuer requeſt thée
of anye ſuch matter, at the deſire of the Moores of Meca,
neither yet vpon the inſtaunce of no other Merchauntes,
that are Traders to Calycut. In receiuing theſe Chriſtians,
and giuing them lading for their ſhips, I do beléeue that
neither to thée nor any other, I doe offence: ſince that it is
a cuſtome we haue amongſt vs, to ſell our Merchandize to
thoſe that will buy them, and to fauour thoſe Merchaunts,
which doe reſort vnto our Countrey. Theſe Chriſtians
came to ſéeke me out farre off, and for that cauſe I did receiue
them, & promiſed to defend them. They are no théeues
as thou doſt tearme them, for they bring great ſums of money,
in golde and ſiluer, and Merchaundize, wherewith they
do trade▪ Then friendſhip I doe and will obſerue, dooing
therein but my dutie, and ſo oughteſt thou to doe, and otherwiſe
I will not take thée to be my friend: neither yet oughteſt
thou or any other be agréeued or offended withall, for
that which I doe, is to inrich my Citie.
               
               With this aunſwere the King of Calycut was ſore offended:
whereby hée tooke occaſion to write this letter following.
               IT grieueth me very much,The reply to the king of Cochings letter. the hatred or enuie thou
haſt conceiued againſt me, for that thereby I do perceiue
thou wilt leaue my friendſhippe for thoſe Chriſtians
ſake, which I take for my great enimies, & ought to be the
cauſe that thou ſhouldeſt accept them after the ſame ſort.
Once more therefore I doe returne to deſire thée, that thou
wilt neither receiue them, nor yet giue them their lading for
their ſhips. For if ſo be thou wilt not be perſwaded, to the
contrary, but rather meaneſt to proſecute thine intent, then

I take God to my Iudge, and from henceforth I doe proteſt,
that I am not in fault of the damage that will growe
vnto thée thereof.
               
               The King of Coching hauing receiued this letter, laughed
at it, ſaieng to his Chaplaine that was the bringer therof,
that he would doe nothing for feare, but that which hée
minded to doe ſhould be vpon requeſt, and ſo aunſwered to
this letter.
               I Haue ſéene thy meſſage,The king of Cochings anſvvere to the reply. which ſoundeth as it were threatenings.
God who alwaies reſiſteth pride, doth fauour him
that hath Iuſtice & equitie on his ſide. Since thou art my
friend, do not requeſt me ſo an abhominable and vnlawfull
a requeſt, as is to vſe treaſon, eſpeciall amongſt Kings, and
if there be any other thing that grieueth thée, and is not
hurtfull to mine honour, I will doe it, yea, although it wer
to my loſſe, which I doe not eſtéeme in compariſon of mine
honour. I doe truſt that thou wilt take this aunſwere in
good part, and preuent the death of men, and the deſtruction
of thy Countrey. But if ſo be notwithſtanding, thou wilt
maintaine thine opinion, God doth well knowe & perceiue
that héereof I am in no fault.
               The King of Calycut perceiuing that the King of Coching,
did ſtand ſo much vpon his reputation, and wold not
doe that which he had requeſted him, did then determine,
(the Captain generall being once departing) to ſet vpon him
by the waye, and vtterly to deſtroy him, againſt whome he
commaunded to be made in a readines, a Fléet of xxix. great
ſhips, that they might encounter with him vpon the Sea, at
his departure toward Portingale, ſuppoſing, that foraſmuch
as they went laden, he ſhould be the better able to do them
the more harme.
            
            
               Of the battaile that was fought betweene the Fleet
of Calycut and the captaine generall, as hee was
going toward Cananor: & how Vincente Sodre,
Pedro Raphael, and Diego Pieres tooke two of
thoſe ſhips, & how the Captaine generall departed
toward Portingale. Chap. 49.
               
                  
                  OF all theſe letters and meſſages, the King
of Coching woulde neuer make the Captaine
generall priuie, vntill ſuch time that
he was ready to depart, and then he tolde
him, which before he was loth to doe. And
for that he ſhould not conceiue and thinke
him to be ſo vaine as to alter his minde to doe as the King
of Calycut would haue him:Great friendſhip and conſtancie in an heathē Prince. he did therefore ſhewe himſelfe
to be ſo conſtant, and ſuch a friend of the king of Portingales,
that for his ſake he woulde aduenture to looſe his
Citie if it were néede. For this the Captaine generall gaue
him great thankes, ſaieng, that the King his Maſter would
neuer forget that good will: and in his name he promiſed
to fauour and ſuccour him in ſuch ſort, that he ſhoulde not
onely haue his kingdome in great aſſuraunce, but alſo that
he would ayde him to conquere others. He willed him alſo
not to feare thoſe Letters that the King of Calicut hadde
ſent him, for that they were nothing els but to put him in
feare, and bring him to be a traitor as he was, being therefore
ſo deſtroyed, and that from henceforth there ſhoulde bée
made ſuch cruell wars againſt him, ye he ſhuld haue inough
to doe to defend himſelfe, much leſſe to make warres againſt
others. All this he tolde him, for the ſuccour of thoſe ſhips
which ſhould remaine in the Indias.
               
               Theſe wordes were ſpoken afore many of his Nayres,
of the which the King was verye gladde that they heard
them. And for that we had knowledge that in reſpect of the
friendſhip that they had with the Moores, they were verye
ſorye that we had the Factory graunted in Coching.
Therefore the Captaine Generall promiſed vnto the King
that from Cananor hée woulde forthwith ſende him thether
a Fléete of ſhips, from whence he was minded to departe.
               
                  
Now after that he had laden his ten ſhippes, and was a
Sea boorde, thrée leagues from Pandarane, he had knowledge
of the nine and twentie great ſhippes of the Moores,
that went to ſéeke him out. And as ſoone as he had ſight of
them, he conſulted with his Captaines to fight with them,
vpon whom with the winde that did begin to blowe, they
did beare.
               This being agréed vppon,A battaile by ſea between our ſhips, and the kings of Calicut the Generall began to beare
toward the Enimies. Vincente Sodre, Pedro Raphael, and
Diego Pieres, for that theyr ſhips were great ſaylers, went
before them all, and theſe were the firſt that did giue the onſet
vpon two of the chiefeſt ſhips. Vincente Sodre, fought
with the one alone, and Pedro Raphael, and Diego Pieres
with the other. Their méeting was with ſuch a valyaunt
minde, that out of both the Enimyes ſhippes there leapt
many into the Sea. The fight indured no longer, but vntill
ſuch time the Captaine generall with the other ſhippes
drewe néere, who did alwayes ſhoote off at them. In the
meane while the reſt of the Enimies did beare all that they
could towarde the ſhoare. The Captaine generall for feare
of the loſſe of ſome of his ſhippes, would not followe, the
rather for that they were all laden: Howbeit, our men
leapte into theyr boates, and there fought with thoſe that
were ſwimming in the water, and ſlewe them all: the
which were néere to the number of thrée hundred perſons.
               After this the Captaine Generall commaunded to diſcharge
theyr Shippes, which were taken, in the which
was founde ſtore of rich Merchaundize:A rich price takē from the enimie. and amongeſt
the ſame theſe péeces following: Sixe great Tynages of
fine Earth, which they doe call Porcelanas, and the ſame
is verye coſtlye, as by experience thereof we do ſée in Portingale:
foure great Guyndes of ſiluer, with certaine
perfuming Pannes of ſiluer: alſo they there founde, certayne
Baſons of ſiluer and gylte, in the which they doe
vſe to ſpit. But that which excéeded the reſt, was an Idoll
of Golde, which weighed thirtie pounde waight, with a

monſtrous face and for his eyes he had two verye fine Emerauldes:
a Veſtement of beaten golde, wrought and ſet
with fine ſtone, the which veſtement belonged vnto this Idoll,
with a Carbuncle or Rubie in his breaſt as bigge as a
Croſado, which gaue as great a lyght as it had bene a fire.
The ſhips being ſet a fire, ye Captaine general departed toward
Cananor, wher he was with the King, who gaue him
a houſe for the Factorie, the poſſeſſion whereof was taken
by Gonſallo Gill Barboſa, who was appointed for Factor,
and by Sebaſtian Aluares, and Diego Godino, Notaries,
and by the Interpretour, called Edwarte Barboſo, and ſundry
others, in all to the number of twentie, of all whom the
King tooke charge vpon him, with all that was in the Factorie:
and bound himſelfe to lade from thenceforth all the
King of Portingales ſhips of Spices, that they ſhould at any
time haue néed of, and this at a certaine price which was
immediately named. The Captaine generall did enter into
the like bonds in the name of the King of Portingale, to defend
him from all thoſe that ſhoulde make him warres for
this cauſe. Alſo the King of Cananor did the lyke, and to
remaine the King of Cochings friend, and not to helpe nor
aide any that ſhould come againſt him, vpon paine that wée
ſhould make him warres: and of all this, there were ſufficient,The order that vvas giuen to Vincente Sodre, at the departure of the Captaine generall frō Cananor.
great and lawfull writings made on all parts. After
this, the Captain generall ſent Vincente Sodre to go along
the Coaſt, and to kéepe the ſame vntill Februarie. And if
in the meane while there were any newes or knowledge of
any lykelihood of warres, betwéene the King of Coching &
the King of Calycut, that then he ſhoulde Winter there in
Coching: but if not, that then he ſhould go to the ſtraights
of the red Sea, to take ſuch ſhips of Meca, as doe paſſe to
the Indias.
               
               This being diſpatched, and thoſe thrée ſhippes laden
with that they ſhould haue, they departed toward Portingale
with thirtéene ſhippes, the twentith daye of December,
in the yeare of our Lord 1503. and ſo arriued with all
their ſhips at Monſanbique.
               
               
                  
And for that the ſhip that Steuen de la Gama went in had
a great leake, he commaunded the ſame to be vnladen and
brought a ground, and after that ſhe was newlye rigged,
they departed. And within ſeauen dayes after, there fell a
great leake in the ſhip yt 
                  Lewis Cotine was in, & for that it
was in ſuch a place that they could not come by it, they
were therefore driuen with all the Fléete to retourne to
Monſanbique, to new rigge the ſame. Now the winde was
ſcant, they were faine to remaine in a certeine créeke, vntill
ſhe was finiſhed, and afterwarde they retourned to their
voyage,They vvere diſperſed by a tempeſt and at the Cape of the Correntes they were
ſo ouertaken with ſtormes which came ſodeinly, and with
ſuch a force vpon them, and that againſt them, that they
were forced to ſtay there with all the Fléete. The ſhip that
Steuen de la Gama went in did beare vp onely with her
fore ſaile, and his ſprit Saile all to torne, by reaſon wherof
he loſt the companie of the whole Fléete, and was no
more ſéene. And within ſixe dayes after that the Captaine
Generall arriued at Liſhborne, ſhée came in alſo with her
Maſt broken. This ſtorme being paſt from this Cape of
the Currents, the Captaine Generall followed his courſe
toward Liſhborne, where he arriued the firſt day of September.
All the noble men of the Court went as farre as
Caſcaes to receiue and accompanie him till he came to the
king. He had going before him his Page, which carryed a
Baſon of ſiluer, within the ſame was layde all the tribute
which the king of Quiloa had paide. Béeing come where
the king was, his grace honourably receiued him, according
as he did deſerue, who had done him ſo great ſeruice, as it
was to diſcouer the Indias, and to leaue ſetled Factoryes
in Coching, and in Cananor, which things muſt néeds redound
vnto the king to moſt certeine gaine and profit, beſides
the great fame and honour which he got therby, in being
the firſt king that had ſent to diſcouer the Eaſt partes,
whereof he might make conqueſt, if ſo be that it pleaſed
him. So in ſatiſfaction the king made him Admerall of the
Indias, and alſo gaue him the title of Lord of Vydeguero,
                  
which was his owne.
            
            
               Of the newes that were giuen out in Coching,
how the king of Calycut put himſelfe in a readineſſe
for the warres, and how Vincente Sodre
wold not ſuccour him, but went to the cape
of Quardafum. Chap. 50.
               
                  AS ſoone as the king had knowledge
that ye Captaine general was departed
toward Portingale, he immediatly
determined to put his warres
in execution, which he had ſignified
to ye king of Coching before. And
ſo he marched toward the village of
Panane, where he beganne to ioyne
his power, which was immediatly
knowne vnto all thoſe of Coching, for that it was not far
of. Wherfore the dwellers there were wonderfully afeard,
ſaieng, that they had cauſe ſo to be, for that the king of Coching
did all things contrarie to iuſtice and equitie. And
ſince he did the ſame vnto thoſe that are of his ſect, and
all moſt naturally borne with him, why ſhould he not doe
the like vnto the chriſtians which are our enimies? And for
that God doth well perceiue the iuſt quarrell the king of
Calycut hath to make him warres, that he will therefore
aide and ſuccour him therein,Both commons & noble mē repine againſt theyr king and our men. vpon the charges of thoſe that
are innocents thereof. This they did not onelye tell our
men, but alſo in euery place they railed at them, and endeauoured
to procure as much hurt as they coulde againſt
them.
               Some of them alſo that were in credite with the king,
and ought vs no great good will, did openlye ſaye, that
if ſo bée that the king of Calycut did come with a greater
power then they hadde, they would immediatlye deliuer

our men vnto him, ſince the warres were begunne in
reſpect of vs and for our ſakes, they did put in hazarde the
loſſe of their kingdome. The king meruailing much of the
boldneſſe of his ſubiects, aunſwered them with louing
wordes, ſaieng that they had offended him verie ſore with
theyr vaine ſpeach, aſſuring them, that if ſo bee that the
king of Calycut woulde come and ſéeke him out, yet hée
woulde notwithſtanding defende himſelfe, onely for that
hée well knoweth, that God will fauour him, for his iuſt
dealing in defending thoſe chriſtians, as he had taken vppon
him to doe. But for all this his ſubiects coulde not bée
well pacified, whereof ſome were deſirous to ſet vppon our
men, but yet they durſt not, for that the king had allowed
them a gard to attend vppon them, and alſo appointed a
ſtrong place for their lodging. Vpon this, there came newes
that Vincente Sodre was come to Coching, who had left
greate hurt done along the coaſt of Calicut, both by water
and by land.
               Of whoſe comming all our men were very glad,
for that they were before in great daunger. But the Factor
perceiuing that they came not a land, ſent the Captaine generall
word by Laurenco Moreno, the certeintie they heard
of the warres, which the king of Calycut was minded to
make vppon the king of Coching, and where hée was at
that preſent in a readineſſe for the ſame.The Captain generall excuſeth himſelfe for deling on the lande. Requeſting him
on his behalfe, and requiring him in the name of the king
of Portingale, that he woulde forthwith diſimbarke himſelfe,
for that with his béeing in Coching they were certein
they ſhould remaine conquerours, yéelding ſufficient reaſon
for the ſame, & otherwiſe that they were in greate daunger.
The Generall aunſwered, that he was appointed
for Captaine Generall of the Sea, and not of the lande,
and did therefore remaine in the Indias, onelye to kéepe
the ſeas.
               Neuertheleſſe if ſo bée that the king of Calycut
had prepared his warres againſt the king of Coching, by
ſea, he would haue defended him, but ſince it was by lande,

he had nothing to doe withall, but to ſuffer the king to defend
himſelfe, for that he would depart to diſcouer the redde
Sea. The Factor vpon this determinate anſwere, did once
more ſend vnto him, requiring him on Gods behalfe, and
the king of Portingales that he would not leaue them ſo,
for that the king of Cochings power was but ſmall to defend
himſelfe withall, in theſe warres againſt the king of
Calicut, who had begun the ſame onely and for none other
cauſe, but to deſtroy our Factorie. And therfore he as Captaine
Generall of the king of Portingale,
                  This generall captaine had other matters of more profit in hand. was bound for to
defend him, and that this was the principall cauſe why he
remained in the Indias. But for all this the General
would not tarrie, and ſo he departed with the reſt of his
Fléet toward the Cape de Quardafum, where he did well
knowe that he ſhoulde take ſundrye rich priſes. This was
that which he did better remember, then to ſtay and defend
the king of Coching or the king of Portingales Factorie.
            
            
               How the king of Calicut ſignified vnto his noble
men, & all ſuch as did aſsiſt him, the cauſes why
he made this warre againſt the king of Coching.
And how the Prince Nabeadarni was hee, that
onely ſpake againſt the ſame. chap. 50.
               
                  AFter that the king of Calycut was come
to Panane, thether alſo came preſentlye
ſundry noble men his ſubiects and others
his friends whome he had ſent for to aide
and ſuccour him in this enterpriſe. Others
there were that came before they were
ſent for: For as ſoone they heard that the warres were begun,
and that for our ſakes that remained in Coching (of
the which they were all glad) hoping therby to hunt vs out
of the Indias, & therfore they came with the better good wil
to ſéeke the deſtruction of the king of Coching. There were
alſo of his owne ſubiects that aroſe againſt him, and ſome

of his nobilitye, as the Caimall of Chirapipill, and hée of
Cambalane, and alſo he of the greate Iland which is ouer
againſt Coching, who carryed with them all the power
that they were able to make. And béeing come into the
preſence of the king of Calycut, he ſpake vnto them all.
               IF that good workes doe engender friendſhippe,The king of Calicut ſignifieth the cauſe vvhy hee beginneth to make theſe vvarres againſt the king of Coching. amongeſt
men, then I, and you for my ſake, and generally
all the Malabars ought to beare the ſame greatly vnto the
Moores, for that it is well knowne, that it is ſixe hundred
yeare ſince they came into the Prouince of Malabar, and
in all this time, yea, to this daie, there was neuer anie that
euer receiued at theyr handes anye hurt or loſſe. But hauing
no ſooner receiued ſtraungers newly come into anye
of our Countries, immediatlye we receiue loſſe by them,
whereſoeuer they doe beginne to ſettle theyr trade. But
the Moores doe trade with the people with all friendſhip,
and loue, as ought to doe one naturall neighbour with
an other, by whoſe meanes the Countrey hath béene alwayes
well prouided of much victualls and merchaundiſe,
which hath béene a cauſe to enrich our Townes; and
that our rents are greatly increaſed, in eſpeciall within
this our Citie. For whileſt the Moores are héere reſident,
they haue made the ſame the greateſt mart Towne that
is in all the Indias.
                  
               
               
                  For this cauſe I am bounde in conſcience, and haue
greate reaſon to fauour them, and to miſlyke of the chriſtians
which to my greate hinderaunce, yea, and againſt
my good will, ſettle in my lande, more for to take the
ſame, and to deſtroye mée, then to bring mée anye profite
or gaines as the Moores doe, hauing giuen of themſelues
greate ſhewes and ſignes thereof within theſe few daies,
that they were héere: as in taking of my Captaine Generall,
and my Embaſſadour priſoners, in making of new
lawes in my Citie, to lade their ſhippes firſt, and before the
Moores ſhuld lade. And vpon this they tooke an occaſion to
ſtaye a certeine Shippe of the Moores, which was the

cauſe, that the Moores did as you doe heare, and as I maye
iudge by the ſequeale thereof, was ſo ordeined of God for
theyr pride, of the which hée was in no fault. Yet this notwithſtanding,
they burnt ten of my ſhippes which lay within
my harbour.
               
               
                  After all this, they with theyr Ordinance deſtroyed my
Citye, ſo that I was driuen to runne awaye out of my pallaice.
Not contented with this, they burnt me other two
ſhippes, which they woulde not haue done if ſo be that they
had come to ſettle a trade. But firſt of all ſince they found
themſelues agréeued, they ſhoulde haue come and made
theyr complaint to mée of the Moores, and tarryed till I had
puniſhed them, and not to doe as they haue done, by which
it was apparant, that they are théeues and no Merchants,
as they name themſelues to be, that vnder this coulour, they
might conquere the whole Countrie. Which things the
king of Coching would neuer vnderſtand nor giue credit
vnto, although I ſent him worde. And being as he is, my
ſubiect, & wel vnderſtanding what they had done vnto mée,
yet he would not but receiue them, & giue them lading for
their ſhips, and now he hath giuen them a factorie, I ſending
him word and praieng him many times that he wold
not conſent therevnto. For this cauſe therfore I haue ſent
for you, that you ſhould ioyne your ſelues. And alſo to requeſt
you to tell me your opinions, whether I haue reaſon
to reuenge my ſelfe or no?
               
               This determination to them all ſéemed verie good,Heere this enterpriſe vvas vvell liked of by his noble men & others▪
                   and
they praiſed his purpoſed intent, but principally the Lord
of Repelyn, forſomuch as hée was a greate enimie to the
king of Coching, for that he had vſurped an Iland of his
called Arraul: alſo of the ſelfe ſame opinion were other
principall Moores. But againſt this his pretended iourney
ſpake the kings brother called Nambeadarin, which was
the onely heire to the Kingdome after the death of his brother:
who immediatlye in the preſence of them all
ſayde.
               
                  
THE kindred that is betwéene thée and mée,The aunſwere vvhich y• prince made to y• foreſayde Oration. beſide
ſundrie other thinges, may certifie thée that I
do deſire more thine honour and profit, then anye
that bée héere preſent, and therefore my councell
ought to be of a more efficacie then anye others. For as
they are not ſo greatlye bound to giue thée the ſame as I
am, ſo as it appeareth they doe feede thy humour, and
councell thée according to thy will, ſince thou art deſirous
to accept it, and not according to good reaſon, which thou
haſt to leaue it. But if ſo bée that they without flatterye,
and thou without paſſion, wouldeſt iudge or weigh the
cauſe of theſe Chriſtians, thou ſhouldeſt finde, that vnto
this preſent time they haue giuen thée no cauſe, but that
they ſhould be well receiued into thy Countrie, and ſo into
all the Prouince of Malabar, and not to hunt them foorth
lyke théeues, which they cannot bée called, although they
were preſent. And foraſmuch as from all the places of
the worlde, men doe reſorte hether, and aſſemble themſelues
to buye thoſe Merchaundiſe which they haue not in
theyr Countryes, and bring thoſe hether which we haue
not héere.
               
               
                  In the ſame ſorte come theſe Chriſtians, and as the cuſtome
is of Merchauntes, they brought thée in their kings
behalfe, the richeſt preſent that thou diddeſt yet euer receiue.
And beſides theyr merchandiſe they brought much
Golde and ſiluer made in coine, which they doe not vſe to
bring which come to make warres. And if ſo bée they
hadde come in anye ſuch ſorte, they woulde not haue diſſimuled
the running awaye that the Pleadges offered
vnto them whome thou doeſt call Embaſſadours, that
were kepte in Priſon, for that theyr Captaine was a
Lande.
               
               
                  But they reconciling themſelues vnto thée, went and
tooke the ſhippe at thy requeſt in the which was the greate
Elephant, and afterward did preſent thée therwith, and with
all that the ſame ſhip carried: beſides, thoſe that are théeues

doe not vſe ſo to doe, nor yet paye ſo well, nor vſe ſo much
truth as they did, for all the time that they were in Calycut,
there was none that did complaine of them, but onely
the Moores, which they did, for that they are their enimies,
and being mooued with enuy to ſée them pertakers of their
profite, did accuſe them that they hadde taken greate ſtore
of Pepper from the owners againſt theyr wills, they
themſelues béeing thoſe that vſe the ſame, and for that the
Chriſtians ſhoulde not benefite themſelues by lading of
theyr ſhips. And foraſmuch as this was ſo apparant, thou
gaueſt them licenſe to take theyr fraight, by the which licenſe,
the Captaine ſent to the ſhippe of the Moores, which
was laden, and they béeing in all the whole fault, did yet
notwithſtanding riſe againſt them. Theſe men then haue
done as it is well knowne to the world, and yet for all this
as quiet men ought to doe, they tarryed all one daye to ſée
whether thou woldeſt excuſe thy ſelfe. But they ſéeing that
there came none from thée, they did then put in execution
the reuenge,The execution of ye pledges defended by the kings brother not traiterouſly as the Moores doe, which went
not to defend the ſhips, although now they ſpeake with a
ſtout ſtomacke, and councell thée to make theſe warres againſt
the king of Coching, for that he did receiue them into
his Citie, where no iuſt cauſe is at all. For his receiuing
of them, it is not to be iudged that it is to hinder thée:
but he receiued them as he would anye other merchaunt
that would haue come to his harbour. After the ſelfe ſame
ſort did the king of Cananor, and the king of Goulan deale
with them, who would not haue admitted them if they had
knowne them to bée théeues. If thou bée minded to baniſh
them out of the Indias, and for this cauſe art determined to
make warre againſt the king of Coching: it is requiſite
alſo thou make warre againſt the king of Cananor, for
from thence they may doe that which thou feareſt they wil
from Coching. But I will not let to tell thée, that thou doeſt
aduenture thy ſelfe againſt him. For that as thou thinkeſt
he is of leſſe power then the king of Cananor.
                  
               
               
                  
Theſe words were ſpoken by Nambeadarin, with ſuch
a ſtomacke and ſo lyberally to the King, that they were by
him well taken: In one reſpect, for that he was a very valyaunt
Gentleman, and in another, for that he was with
him in great credit and authoritie. And for this cauſe they
hadde him in great reputation: Inſomuch, that if the
Moores and Caymayles had not ſhewed themſelues verye
ſtout againſt him, the King woulde not haue gone forward
with his enterpriſe to make wars againſt the King of Coching.
                  The Mores ouerthrovv the credit of ye kings brothers Oration.
Howbeit, they ſtood vppon their reputation ſo much,
that they thought it would be a great imbaſing to their credite,
in eſpecially hauing aſſembled ſo great a power as the
King had done, and not to goe forward, or at the leaſt to do
ſome what afore they did retourne. By meanes whereof, it
was poſſible, that the King of Coching hearing of theyr
comming, would now doe that for feare, which hée would
not otherwiſe doe before, béeing prayed. After all this,
the King of Calycut would néedes know of his Witches,
what daye was good to march forward in with his Armie,
who appointed him a fortunate one, and promiſed him the
victory againſt the King of Coching, and that as yet there
would come vnto him more men. With this certainetie,
which the Witches had comforted the King withall, which
he much truſted vpon, he departed toward the Countrey of
Repelyn, which is foure leagues from Coching.
               
            
            
               ¶Of the great feare that our men were in, leaſt the
King of Coching would haue deliuered them to
the King of Calycut. Cap. 52.
               
                  OF all this, whatſoeuer hadde paſt, was the
King of Coching aduertiſed, by ſundry eſpyes
which he had in the Campe of ye king
of Calycut: and therefore he ſtoode ſomewhat
in feare of him, for that he hadde not
ſufficient men to defend himſelfe, foraſmuch
as all thoſe that he hoped had fauoured him, were tourned againſt

him: yea, euen thoſe that were his owne ſubiectes,
whome if he hadde on his ſide, he had bene ſure to haue
giuen the King of Calycut the ouerthrow. Therefore, for
that he had but few men, he was greatly afeard thereof, and
the rather,The very ſight of our men abhorred in Coching for that of thoſe there, the moſt part ſerued him
againſt their will, in eſpecially they that were dwellers in
Coching, which did abhorre ye very ſight of our men, where
vpon they openly ſpake it, that it were good that the King
of Coching ſhould deliuer our men to the king of Calycut,
or els that he put them out of Coching, and ſo he might acquite
himſelfe of theſe warres. Moreouer, there were many
of the inhabitants of Coching, that ranne their wayes, and
left their houſes, and all for feare of this warre. Our men
alſo on the other parte were gretly afearde to ſée this tumult,
which gaue them occaſion to waye the daunger that
they wer in, for all that the king did warrant them. Wherfore
the Factor fearing the ſucceſſe thereof, procured lycenſe
of the King to goe to Cananor, hoping that there, they
ſhould be very quiet, vntill ſuch time the fléete ſhould come
from Portingale, thinking that the King by this meanes,
ſhould breake vp thoſe warres, that were pretended againſt
him, and alſo his Subiectes be the better contented therewith.
               But at thoſe words the King ſéemed to be in heauines,The aunſvvere vvhich the king of Coching made to the factor &
tolde the Factor, that now it appeared very well, that he had
but ſmall confidence in him, that he would aſke him licenſe
to depart, and therfore he told him he would giue him none:
but rather requeſted him earneſtly not to haue any ſuch miſtruſt,
for he there gaue him his worde, and it ſtoode him ſo
much vpon his credite, in preſeruing them all alyue, that he
would rather looſe his Kingdome and lyfe withall, then delyuer
them to the King of Calycut, or to other that ſhould
doe them any harme. And if ſo be that his euill Fortune
were ſo great that he ſhould looſe Coching, yet there would
not lacke a place of ſufficient ſtrength to ſende them vnto,
vntill the comming of the next Fléete from Portingale to
the Indias.
               
               
                  
And although ſayd he, the king of Calycut ſhoulde come
with a great power, yet for all that he is not aſſured of the
victory: for it is ſéene many times that few with valyant
hearts,Fevve hauing the right on their ſide, preuayle moſt times againſt nūbers that come in an euill cauſe. doe giue the ouerthrowe vnto great numbers without
ſtrength: much more hauing as I haue, Iuſtice & equitie
on my ſide. And therefore he willed them to be quyet,
& to pray vnto their God to giue him ye victory. With theſe
words, knowing well that the King did ſpeake them with a
louing minde, our men remained ſomewhat eaſed of the
feare wherein they were, and would haue kiſſed his hands,
but he would not ſuffer them ſo to doe, nor yet woulde agrée
that they ſhould helpe him in his warres, which they
did offer him to do, but aunſwered them, that he would not
place them in anye ſuch daungerous place, for that it ſtoode
vpon his credite ſo much to kéepe them alyue. And for that
they ſhould remaine as witneſſes, how much he did trauell
to ſaue their lyues, therefore from thencefoorth he committed
the kéeping of them vnto certayne Nayres, ſuch as he had a
confidence in.
               And that this mutenie might ceaſe, and they from thence
foorth not haue anye occaſion to murmure againſt our men,
he commaunded to be called afore him all his Noble men,
ſuch as were with him, and alſo certaine of the principall
Nayres, which were the occaſion of all this trouble, & ſpake
vnto them after this manner.
               I Cannot but be verye heauie,The king of Cochings Oration to his noble men. to ſée ſo lyttle truth remayne
in you: For I meruayle nothing at all at the
ruſticall ſorte of men, whome oftentimes their pouertie
enforceth to vſe all kinde of villanye. But of you, I doe
greatlye meruayle that are Nayres, that haue bene alwaies
true in your dealyngs, that you now would haue me break
my worde and promiſe, that I haue alreadye giuen to the
Captayne Generall, concerning theſe Chriſtians, which
was to kéepe his men to the vttermoſt of my power, and
to looke that no man ſhoulde doe them anye harme or
vyolence, but alwayes for to haue as good a regarde

vnto them as vnto mine owne naturall ſubiects. And therefore
he left them in this my Citie, which was done alſo by
your conſents. And ſince you doe perceiue, that the King of
Calycut hath a fewe more men then I, ye would perſwade
me to doe contarry to my promiſe: ſo that if I were of ſo
ill a nature as you would haue me to be, then ought you of
all other to abhorre me, and crye out vpon me. Be ye héerein
your owne Iudges, If you remained with anye other
King vpon his word, would you allow that as well done in
him, which you would haue me doe, by theſe Chriſtians?
In eſpeciall, counting him as we account of this man, for
our enimy, hauing none occaſion ſo to be, as the King of Calicut:
and I your King, hauing no occaſion to deliuer you,
as I haue none to delyuer theſe Chriſtians? Which, ſince
it is ſo, what is the councell that ye minde to giue me héerin,
that may not be reprhended in another? If it be for that
you are afeard of the King of Calycut,
                  It is better to dye vvith honor, then to lyue vvith the infamous name of a rude and lieng Prince. then know this, that
it were better to dye an honourable death then to liue with
diſhonour, then which there cannot happen greater to mée,
then to breake my word, nor yet more infamie vnto you,
then to be ſubiects to a ruſticall and a falſe King, in eſpeciall
againſt theſe Chriſtians, who haue brought me ſo great profite
as they haue done. And as for the King of Calycut, hée
well knoweth that if he wold haue conſented that the Factorie
might haue bene ſetteled in his Citie, he might haue
kept them in his Countrey. But now becauſe they are
gone he mooueth theſe warres, the rather, for that hée well
knoweth my power is but ſmall, and therfore mindeth to
reuenge on me the loſſe he hath receiued. If his meaning be
none other, then to hunt theſe Chriſtians out of the Indias,
and to fight with him, whoſoeuer receiueth them into his
Countrey, why then doth he not beginne his warres firſt
with the King of Cananor? But that is not the occaſion
onely, but the enuie which he hath to ſée me benefited, and
for that with his pride he ſuppoſeth, that I am not able to
reſiſt him. All this doe I very well vnderſtand, and moreouer
I doe receiue comfort in preſeruing of theſe Chriſtians,

hoping in God, that he therefore will giue me the victory againſt
him. And as touching you that are my friends, I
pray you therefore to ſtand to me.
               
               Now all that were preſent héereby, ſéeing this his determination,
meruailed greatlye at his conſtancie, and craued
pardon at his hands for the feare they found themſelues to
be in before, promiſing all of them to lyue and dye in his
ſeruice: for the which he gaue them heartie thankes. Immediately
after this, he commaunded the Factor to be called
with the reſt of our men, vnto whom he tolde all what
he had done, and in their preſence named for Captaine generall,The kings brother made general of the field, and armie▪
                  
the Prince Naramuhin his brother, and next inheritor
to the Crowne, & commaunded euery man to obey him, in
as ample manner, as his owne perſon. His charge was ſet
downe, that he ſhould march forward with fiue thouſande
fiue hundred Nayres, & entrench himſelfe hard by the Foord,
by which waye he knew for moſt certaine, that the King of
Calycut was determined to enter into yt Iland of Coching:
whereas at an Ebbe, the water commeth vp but to the
knées.
            
            
               ¶How the Prince of Calycut made offer ſundrye
times to enter into the Iland of Coching, by this
Foord, and how he was reſiſted by the Prince of
Coching. Chap. 53.
               
                  NOw the King of Calycut hauing notice,
that Naramuhin had pitched his royall Armie
hard by this Foord, to reſiſt thereby his
entraunce into Coching, he was ſomewhat
feared therewith: in eſpeciall for that hée
knew the foreſaid Prince, to be one of the
valianteſt Gentlemen, that was accompted off in all that
Prouince of Malabar, & the moſt fortunate in wars. Somewhat
therefore for this feare, more then for anye good will
that he ought to the King of Coching, to vſe any kinde of
courteſie towards him, he ſent him this letter.
               
                  
I Haue trauailed as much as I could to excuſe this war
with thée,The king of Calycuts letter to ye king of Coching▪
                   if ſo be that thou woldeſt temper thy pride, &
doe y• which I haue requeſted thée, being as it is, ſo iuſt, neceſſary
and profitable vnto vs all. And for that this our falling
out might goe no further, I giue thée to vnderſtande,
that I am come to Repelyn with a great power for to enter
thy Country, & there to take thoſe Chriſtians which are
with thée, withall their Merchandize: yet notwithſtanding,
I will firſt aduertiſe thee, that my deſire is, that thou doe
ſende them vnto me, which if thou wilt doe, then will I forget
the enuie and hatred I haue conceiued againſt thée for
that which is paſt, whereas otherwiſe, I haue promiſed to
take thy Countrey from thée, & put all thoſe that are dwellers
there, to the ſword.
               Although now the King of Coching had very great lack
of men, and did well perceiue that it might come ſo to paſſe,
as the King of Calycut had written vnto him. Neuertheleſſe,
he neuer meant to moue his determination, but did
aunſwere after this manner.
               IF thou hadſt demaunded of me after a ciuill order,The aunſvvere which the king of Coching made to the foreſaid letter▪
                   & with
louing wordes, that which thou doeſt commaund with ſo
great a pride, I would not haue indged thée of leſſe valour,
then that thou thinkeſt I might take thée to be off: For
where there is wiſedome or ſtrength, there is no diſcurteſie
ſhewed by meanes of ill bringing vp. Theſe be things that
God is not pleaſed withall: neither yet haue I ſo offended
him, that I ſhould conſent ſo much to my loſſe, or think that
the victory ſhould not be mine and theſe valyant mens that
are with me. Thou ſhalt be welcome with all thy pride,
and I verely beléeue, that with theſe few which I haue, ouer
and beſide my iuſt quarrell, ſhall ſuffice to defend me from
thée, and other mine enimies. Thou ſhalt neuer finde mée
ſo weake, that I will doe anye thing with ſuch ſhame as
thou demaundeſt. And if ſo be, that thou haſt vſed to accuſtome
thy ſelfe to ſuch deceiptes, ſo it is: I did neuer vſe

the ſame, nether yet will I accuſtome my ſelfe ſo to doe.
Touching the Chriſtians, or any part of their goods, make
thou no reckoning, for that I doe minde to defende the
ſame. Therefore to bée ſhort, ſende me no more meſſengers.
               
               With this aunſwere was the King of Calycut ſo offended,
that he ſware he woulde deſtroye all, and reuenge
himſelfe vppon the King of Coching. And therefore foorthwith
hée departed from Repelyn the laſt daye of March,
and entered into the Lande of the King of Coching, in the
which he did no hurt, for that the Lordes of that ſoyle were
all in his fauour. And on the ſeconde daye of Aprill, beeing
come néere vnto this Foorde where Naramuhin was
intrenched,The Calicutians repulſed frō paſsing ouer the Foorde. ſome of the King of Calycuts Captaynes had
great hope through the multitude of theyr men which they
had with them, to giue the onſet, with determination to
paſſe the Foorde: but it was ſo manfullye defended, that
they retired with the loſſe of many.
               Whervpon the King of Calycut tooke this for an ill beginning:
but for all that, after that hée had pitched his
Campe, he ſent the next daye the Lorde of Repelyn with
as manye more men as there was the daye before, and ſundrye
Paraos by water, ſuppoſing that then he woulde paſſe
ouer this Foorde. But it chaunced farre otherwiſe, and
they miſt at that time of theyr purpoſe, for that Naramuhin
as yet did valyauntlye defende the ſame with a ſtout
courage.
               At this preſent, were with him Laurenſo Moreno,
with other more our men, which ſhewed themſelues
lyke valyaunt Gentlemen, as before time they hadde done
in diuers other Battayles, which the aforeſayde Prince
Naramuhin hadde with his Enimies, in the which hée had
alwayes the victorye,Incōſtancie 
                        •
                     n the king of Calycut noted. with the loſſe of many of their men.
When the King of Calycut perceiued his loſſe, and béeing
now, as hée euer was, inconſtant and fearefull, hée
euen repented himſelfe, that euer hée did beginne theſe
warres.
               
                  
For he thought that immediately vpon his comming to this
Foord, he ſhould haue paſſed the ſame. Wherefore he ſent againe
another meſſenger to the King of Coching, that hée
foorthwith ſhould ſend vnto him thoſe Chriſtians: who anſwered,
that ſince he would not delyuer them before time,
when as he had occaſion ſomwhat to feare his power, what
ſhall he thinke he would doe now, when he hath the aduantage?
But he aduertiſed him to looke well vnto himſelfe, for
that now he would not be contented onely with defending
his Countrey,A ſtout ſtomacke of a prince▪
                   but hoped to giue him ye ouerthrow: which
indéed had taken effect, if ſo be that his vntrue ſubiects, had
not forſaken him. With this aunſwere the King of Calycut
remained in ſome feare, and indéed without any hope of
victory, if ſo be that it had not bene for his owne ſouldiers,
which gaue him councell to ſend to ouerun certaine townes
of Coching, which lay hard thereabouts, he would haue left
the warres. Which had the ſooner bene finiſhed, if Naramuhin
had not bene driuen to ſend to ſuccour thoſe Townes,
with ſome of his men. The king thought ye by this meanes
remaining there but with the fewer, his ſtrength ſhoulde be
thereby diminiſhed.
               But this pollicie was preuented by Naramuhin, who
had a meruailous forecaſt to foreſée ſuch innouations. And
for all this he furniſhed all places, where it was requiſite,
in ſuch ſort, as though himſelfe had bene there preſent. And
notwithſtanding all this, the King of Calycut loſt manye
of his men.
            
            
               How Naramuhin Prince of Coching, was ſlaine
by treaſon, which the King of Calycut
practiſed: and alſo how the King of Coching
receiued the ouerthrowe, and was driuen
to go to Vaypin for ſuccour, and caried
with him all our men. Chap. 54.
               
                  
                  THE king of Calicut ſéeing that his Captains
could not paſſe through that forde to
encounter with Naramuhyn, he forthwith
practiſed how he might paſſe the ſame by
ſome pollicie.Treaſon practiſed againſt ye prince Naramuhim▪
                   For the which intent he ſecretly
vſed conference with the paye maiſter
of thoſe Nayres which Naramuhyn had in his campe,
and agreed vpon this, that there ſhould be no paiment ſent
to the Campe, as before he was wont to ſend daily, but that
they ſhould go to Coching to receiue the ſame there. And
for his reward that he ſhould conſent thervnto, he ſent him
a great preſent. By this meanes therefore Naramuhyn remaining
alone and vnfurniſhed, his enimyes might paſſe
the ſayd ford the better. This being agréed vpon, the payemaiſter
according to his promiſe, ſent worde to the Captaine,
that all ſuch Nayres as were in wages with the king
of Coching, ſhould come and fetch their wages, for that hée
could not ſend it them as before time. The Nayres hauing
licenſe of Naramuhym, he charged them to retourne afore
day, who promiſed him ſo to doe, howbeit they coulde not
come, for that their paiment was delaied, till it was broad
day: and thus whileſt they were in Coching, the king of Calicut
entered the ford with his whole power both by lande
and by ſea, and with much ordinance, and the whileſt that
Naramuhim remained thus alone, the king of Calicuts power
grew to be greater then euer it was before. Then gaue
he the onſet, at the which Naramuhin was driuen to retire
vnto certeine Palme trées, where ioyned vnto him all his
men that he had left, he caſt them into one ſquadron, which
being as they were but few, did oftentimes break the aray
of their enimies, with the which there were many ſlaine.
But as Naramuhins power was but ſmall,Prince Naramuhim and his povver ouerthrovvne. ſo they were
compaſſed round about. And after that he had done manye
notable acts, he was ouerthrowne, both he and two couſins
of his which ther alſo very valiant gentlemen, with ſundry
others. Thus was he and all his ſlaine which remained in

the field. The king of Calycut would not followe the chaſe
of thoſe that ranne awaie, for that it was night, for ſo long
the battaile indured. Ther were many of the enimies ſlaine
alſo.
               This newes béeing brought to the king of Coching,
hée was therewith a while as it were beſide himſelfe, and
almoſt of euery man taken for dead, in eſpecial of our men
that were preſent. Thoſe Nayres that were our mens kéepers
made no account of them, for that they had inough to
doe to ſuccour the king. When this ouerthrow was ſpread
abroade, partly for the ill will which they ought our men,
they ſayde that they were the cauſe of Naramuhins
death and the others, & that the king was not able to deliuer
them from death. With this, the king returned to himſelfe,
and began to wéepe, and ſpake ſundry wordes, which
our men did not vnderſtand,Comfortable vvords of a prince▪
                   for that his remembrance was
as it were taken from him, ſo that being hard by him; hée
ſawe vs not, but at length he aſked for vs, with that our
men drew néere toward him, who made vs alſo to wéepe,
onely to ſée him in that agonie. And being fully come vnto
himſelfe, he willed them in anye caſe not to feare, neither
yet to doubt that this miſchance ſhould haue any ſuch power,
as to make him chaunge from that which he hadde alwayes
promiſed. For which words they would haue kiſſed
his hands, but he would not conſent therevnto, and
hearing the ſturre that his men made againſt ours, he ſayd
vnto them.
               NOw that Fortune doth ſhew her ſelfe froward againſt
me,The kings Oration made vnto his ſubiects about the loſſe of his kingdome. I had thought that as true friends and louing ſubiects
ye wold haue trauelled to giue me héerein ſome comfort.
But ye are deſirous to followe and ſerue the king of
Calycut, which as often as I doe remember, it doubleth
my paine for the death of the Prince my brother, and my
Couſins, and ſince you alſo are againſt the Chriſtians,
whome I haue ſo oftentimes in commended vnto you,
you doe well knowe, that it will bée much more griefe

vnto mée, that they at your handes ſhoulde receiue anye
hurt (then I haue alreadie receiued for the death of my
kinſmen, ſince they lyke true ſubiectes dyed in my defence)
and you are deſirous to perſecute thoſe whome I
haue receiued vnder my protection, and ſuch as remaine
with mée for my comfort. It were a harde matter for me
to perſwade my ſelfe that this ouerthrowe happened vnto
mée, for dooing vnto theſe men as I ought to doe. Doe
you not iudge ſo, for I will not beléeue that they were the
cauſe, neither yet for that I doe fauour them, therefore
God doth fauour the king of Calycut againſt mée.Ouerthrovvs in vvar ſent of God vnto princes for their of fences. It is
not ſo, but for that I haue offended him otherwiſe: I am
very glad that there hath béene this occaſion giuen, that I
might receiue condigne puniſhment, and that the King of
Calicut might bée the onelye executor of his iuſtice. And
that alſo for all other offences that I haue done, I might
bée puniſhed by him in ſéeking my deſtruction, the rather
for that I doe kéepe my promiſe with theſe Chriſtians,
in eſpeciall béeing as wée bée, ſo much bounde vnto them.
Therefore weie well this cauſe, and let it not ſinke into
your mindes, that for vſings clemencie to theſe Chriſtians,
and for defending them I receiue this puniſhment,
neither yet that the King of Calycut hath power to ouerthrowe
my power which I canne make, and deſtroye me
altogether, although that nowe hée driueth mée out of Coching.
                  
               
               
                  The Fléete of the Chriſtians will not tarrye long,
and then the Generall will reſtore vnto mée againe my
Kingdome. In the meane ſpace lette vs goe to the Ilande
of Vaypin, which is ſtrong, and for that the Winter is
at hande, I truſt in God wée ſhall eſcape the King of Calicut.
And ſince my loſſe is farre more then yours, I comfort
my ſelfe with this, requeſting you to doe the lyke,
&: not to be an occaſion to renue my troubles with this your
mutinie.
               
               They ſéeing the greate conſtancie of theyr King,
                     
meruailed much thereat, and immediatlye did quiet themſelues
and promiſed him that they would do that which hée
had commaunded, and ſo they did. The conſtancie of ye king
was ſo great, that whereas once more the king of Calycut
ſent him word, that if ſo be that he would deliuer our men
vnto him, he would preſently leaue the warres, yet he wold
not conſent therevnto, but ſent him word againe, that ſince
that he had gotten the victorie more by treaſon, then by valiantneſſe,
for if ſo be that valure had bene vſed, his brother
and couſins had not died, but they were betraied by thoſe
that faine would kill him alſo. He did not paſſe for Coching
it ſelfe, but hoped that thoſe Chriſtians which he looked for
euery day, who reſtore him vnto it again, & likewiſe reuēge
his quarrell. This aunſwere being come to the king of Calycut,
he commaunded to deſtroye the whole countrie with
fire and ſwoord, which commaundement being once known,
the feare was ſo great amongſt the inhabitants of Coching
that the moſt part of them ranne away,The inhabitants of Coching flye for feare of the king of Calicut▪
                      & with them went
two Milaneſis, which were Lapidaries, that remained with
the Factor, which vpon the King of Portingale commaundement
were brought thether by Vaſco de la Gama: the
one of theſe was called Ioan Marya, and the other Pedro
Antonio. Thoſe did diſcouer vnto the king of Calycut the
feare that the dwellers of Coching were in of him, & how
that dayly they came awaie. They alſo did offer the king
to make him ordinance, and afterward they made him ſome
as it ſhall appeare in the ſequeale of the hiſtorie. The king
of Calycut made verie much of this Milaneſis, & gaue them
greate rewards, to the ende therby he might winne them to
make him more ordinance: and hauing certein knowledge,
how few people were left in Coching, & what feare thoſe
that remained were in, and how few men the king had to
defend himſelfe, he put his men in a readineſſe to take the
ſame. The king of Coching carrieng ſome of our men in
his companie, went to méet with the king of Calycut, wheras
that daie he behaued himſelfe that it was wonder to ſée.
Neuertheleſſe for all that the enimies being verye many,

and the king ſomewhat hurt, he was faine to retire, and for
that he durſt not tarrie another battaile, he therefore repaired
vnto another Iland called Vaypin,
                  The king of Coching is faine to flye and leaue his citie. which is right
ouer againſt Coching, and is verie ſtrong, to the which he
carried with him all our men, and all the Factorie, ſo that
there was nothing loſt. The Citie béeing thus diſinhabited,
the king of Calycut commaunded the ſame to be ſetts
a fire. After this he ſent his men to enter the Ilande of
Vaypin, which for that our men and others did defend it
with greate valour, and for that the Winter was at hand,
and ſtormes of foule weather did beginne, the king of Calycut
was driuen of force to giue ouer, and to leaue the
warres, and ſo went to Grangalor, with determination to
returne vpon the ſame Ilande at the ſpring. For the which
cauſe he commaunded to be made manye trenches about
Coching, and left many of his men to kéepe the ſame.
            
            
               How Vincente Sodre and Blas Sodre were caſt awaie
at Curia Muria, and what the other Captaines
did afterward. chap. 55.
               
                  
                     VIncente Sodre with his Fléete béeing departed
from the harbour of Coching, without
hauing any reſpect to ſuccour the king,
or thoſe that remained in the Factorie, but
woulde needes goe towarde the kingdome
of Cambaia, to take ſuch rich ſhips of the
Moores as come from ye red ſea to Calycut. Vpon the ſame
coaſt he tooke by y• helpe of other Captains fiue ſhips, in the
which onely in ready money there was found two hundred
thouſand Perdaos. The moſt part of the Moores wer ſlaine
in the battaile, and their ſhips burnt. From thence he kept
his courſe toward certein Ilands called Curia Muria, which
ſtood a ſeaboord the Cape of Quardafum, where hée thought
good to bring his ſhips a ground, which were all open.

He arriued there the twentéeth of Aprill in the yere of our
Lord.1503 The familiaritie & ſecuritie of ye inhabitants of the Iland of Curia Muria. 1503. And although all thoſe Ilandes were greatlye
inhabited by the Moores, yet he would venture a land,
ye rather for that the dwellers in that Iland were no men of
war, ſo that with the onely feare they ſtoode in of our men,
they gaue them good interteinment, ſelling vnto them ſuch
victualls as they had, and did conuerſe in their companie.
               
                  Vincente Sodre hauing brought a Caruell a grounde,
therevpon the Moores tooke occaſion to tell him, that in the
moneth of Maye, there came alwayes ſuch a torment or
ſtorme out of the North, that no ſhips doe remaine there,
but are driuen a lande. And therefore ſuch as knowe the
ſame, doe immediatly auoide the daunger, willing him likewiſe
ſo to doe, and to remoue himſelfe on the other ſide of
the Ilande, which will be a defence for them, and when the
ſtorme is paſt they may returne without feare. But he not
making account of their words, but rather iudging yt they
meant to do him ſome diſpleaſure, wold not go from thence
but aunſwered them that their ſhips had Ankors of wood,
that they were driuen ſo a ſhore, but his were of yron: and
for all that the Moores could perſwade him, he wold neuer
be remoued. Yet Pedro Raphael, Hernan Rodrigues Badarſas,
                  The effect which the torment vvrought amongeſt their ſhips in that coaſt.
and Diego Pierres would not tarrie, but on the laſt
day of Aprill they went their waie, and as for Vincente
Sodre and his brother, they remained. And when the torment
came and began to blow, their ſhips were driuen on
ſhore, for all their Ankors, and were torne in péeces, in the
which there were many men ſlaine. Amongſt theſe ther died
the two brethren, and of the ſhips was nothing ſaued,
but onely the Captaines that remoued with the Caruell
that was brought a ground. The loſſe of the two brothers
was iudged to come by the handie worke of God, for their
ſins, and for not fauouring the king of Coching, & for leauing
the Factour with the Factorie of the king of Portingale
in ſo greate a daunger. And therefore thoſe that were
ſaued returned toward Coching to ſuccour our men, if happely
they had any ſuch néed.
               
                  
Amongeſt themſelues they appointed for Captaine Generall
Pedro de Tayde, and ſo they made ſaile at the entering
of Maie. And for that the Winter of the Indias was
come, they paſſed greate ſtormes, whereby they ſawe
themſelues ſundry times in great danger. And for that they
could not fall with Coching, therfore they were driuen to
winter in Anſadina. Thrée or foure dayes after their cō
                  ming
thether, there came thether alſo a ſhippe from Portingale,
of the which was captaine a gentleman called Antonio
delcimpo, who departed alone after Don Vaſco dela
Gama: his tarrieng was ſo long by reaſon yt his pilot died,
by meanes whereof he was driuen to kéep the coaſt, ſo that
with great trouble & danger he arriued at Anſadina, wher
he was driuen to winter, where alſo they ſuſteined great neceſſitie
for lacke of victualls.
            
            
               How Franciſco de Alburquerque, and Alonſo de Alburquerque
departed to the Indias, for two captaines generalls

& did after their comming reſtore the king of
Coching to his kingdome. chap. 56.
               
                  IN the yeare of our Lord.1503. 1503. the king of
Portingale ſuppoſing that the Admiral had
left ſetled the Factorie quietly in Coching
& Cananor,
                  The iiii. voiage frō Portingal to the Indias. & that he ſhould haue no ſuch
néed as to ſend any great fléet. Therfore he
determined to ſend but ſixe ſhips, imparted
vnto two Captaines generalls. Of the firſt there he named
for Captaine general a gentleman called Alonſo de Alburquerque,
which afterward was gouernour of ye 
                  Indias, as
héereafter I ſhall declare in the third booke. Theſe were his
Captaines, one called Edwarto Pacheco, of whom I ſpake
before, & Hernan Martines Maſcarennas, who they ſaid died
in the voiage to Gordo. Of the other thrée he appointed
for Captaine general one Franciſco de Alburquerque, couſin
to ye other Alonſo Alburquerque. Theſe following wer
his Captaines, Nicholas Coello, one yt was in ye diſcouery
of the Indias, and Pedro Vas de la Vega.
                  
This Fléete departed fiftéene daies after Alonſo de Albuquerque,
and ſo as well the one as the other, paſſed in their
voyage great ſtormes, in the which was loſt Pedro vas de
Lauega, Franciſco de Albuquerque, which departed laſt
of all, came firſt, and before Alonſo de Albuquerque, who
brought with him Nicholas Coello to Anſadina, who came
thether in the month of Auguſt, where as yet he found Pedro
de Taide with their Captaines, which were forced to
winter ther. And hauing certeine knowledge of the warres
that were publiſhed betwéene the king of Calicut and the
king of Coching, and all about our men, they went immediatly
with all the Fléete, which was of ſixe ſailes to Cananor,
for that he would enforme himſelfe the better thereof,
and what had paſſed in Coching. At theyr arriuall in
Cananor our men were verye glad of theyr comming. The
king of Cananor himſelfe reioyſed ſo much, that he went
to viſite the Captaine generall a ſea boord, and told him all
what perticularly had happened to the king of Coching, and
where the king was.
               As ſoone as he knew all this, he immediatly departed
toward Coching, to the which place he came on Saterdaie
at night, being the ſecond day of September in the ſelfe ſame
yeare. As ſoone as his comming was knowne to the king
of Coching, ther was great reioyſing at the ſame, not onely
of the king & our men,The king of Coching reioyceth at the comming of the Portingale fleete. but of all the dwellers in Coching.
There were ſundrye that at his comming did ſo reioyce,
that they plaied vpon ſundrie ſorts of inſtruments, in token
thereof. All thoſe that were in theyr trenches by the king
of Calycuts commaundement, viewing this great ioye and
mirth, and perceiuing wherfore it was, as ſoone as the night
came, ranne their waie to Grangalor, for ſo the king of Calycut
had commaunded them to doe, who alſo knewe of
their comming by the waye of Cananor. Immediatlye on
Sundaie in the morning, Franciſco de Albuquerque came
to an Ankor at the entering of the riuer of Coching.
The king hearing of his arriuall, alſo ſent to viſite him by
the Factor.
               
                  
On the Munday morning, Franciſco de Alburquerque hauing
left his ſhips in good order, tooke his boates, being very
well armed, and went in the ſame vnto Vaypin, & caried
with him alſo two Caruells to ſuccour him, if there ſhould
come any Paraos from Calycut. As he went ſomewhat far
off from the Caruells, came after him Edwarte Pachece,
who ſuſpecting wherevpon he went, leapt into his boat with
ſome of his men, which came after him, with ſuch haſt, hee
made with his rowing, that he ouertooke him before he came
to Vaypin, where the King of Coching was tarrieng for
him along the water ſide, with as many men as went with
him to the Iland.The king of Coching ioyfully be holdeth the return of ye Portingale Fleete. The pleaſure was ſo great of theyr méeting,
that as ſoone as the King of Coching had ſight of our
boates, he began to crye out ſaieng: Portingale, Portingale,
and all thoſe that were with him did the lyke. Our men
alſo out of their boates did aunſwere after the ſelfe ſame
manner, ſaieng: Coching, Coching, in deſpite of the King
of Calycut. As Franciſco de Albuquerque did leape a land,
the King of Coching was there ready, and tooke him in his
armes, with the teares in his eyes, for excéeding ioye, ſaying:
that his deſire was to lyue no longer, but to ſee himſelfe reſtored
to Coching, that his Subiectes might well perceiue,
how much he was bound to paſſe ſo great troubles as hée
had paſt, & all for to ſerue the King of Portingale. In whoſe
name, the Captaine generall gaue him great thankes, with
promiſe to reuenge his quarrell vpon his enimies. And for
his part he gaue him ten thouſand crownes to ſpend, during
the time that he did not receiue his rents, and this money
was taken out of the Coffer he carried: which gift ye king
of Coching eſtéemed very much, for that he was very poore.
Alſo his ſubiects iudged this to be done right liberally as it
was noted amongſt them all:Liberalytie vvinneth the hearts of the moſt barbarous & vnfriēdly people▪
                   and from thencefoorth they
thought all to be well beſtowed, that the King had done for
our men. Foorthwith they carried the King to Coching,
where he entered with great glorye, beſides the reioycing
which his ſubiects made: and from thenceforth all our men,
were amongſt them well eſtéemed. Now it was not long

after that the newes how that the King was retourned to
Coching, was brought to the King of Calycuts cares, and of
the money that the Captaine generall had giuen him: who
ſeeing that there was likelyhood of wars, ſent certain Caymales
into his Countrey to defend the ſame, for that it ioyned
vnto the kingdome of Coching.
               
            
            
               How Franciſco de Alburquerque began the warres
againſt all thoſe that were enimies to the king of
Coching: and how the Caymall of the Ilande of
Charanaypin was ſlaine. Chap. 57.
               
                  THe King of Coching being put in his poſſeſion,
Franciſco de Albuerquerque tooke
his leaue of him: His entent was, that yet
afore night he would partly reuenge himſelfe
vpon his enimies. And ſo he went to
the Iland which is ouer againſt Coching.
Now as the inhabitants thereof were ſomewhat forgetful,
and thought not that as that daye he woulde retourne, ſo
therefore did our men ſet vppon them before they were aware,
and that vpon ſuch a ſodaine, that there were ſlaine of
them a great number, and ſundry of their Townes ſet a
fire, and afterward they imbarked themſelues without receiuing
any harme. And Franciſco de Alburquerque going
toward his Fléete, met with the King, and tolde him what
he had done. The next day after, he returned to the ſame Iland,
to deſtroy it altogether. He caried with him to y• number
of ſixe hundred men, for ſo many he had, with thoſe that
he found in the other two ſhips, and there went with him al
his Captaines: The Caymall of that Ilande was tarrieng
for him along the water ſide, with two thouſand Nayres,
wherof the moſt part were bow men, y• others had ſpeares,
ſwords, and targets. They did all they coulde to kéepe our
men from landing, which they did without receiuing anye
hurt: and they being galled ſore with our Croſſebowes,
were driuen away.
               
                  
Our men followed them vnto the other ſide of the Ilande
with ſo ſtout a ſtomacke,The Caymal & 
                        〈◊〉
                      povver, put to flight by the Portingale
                        •
                     . that they had no other remedie
but to take the water, leauing behinde them many of
their companye ſlaine and hurte. And our men not hauing
with whom to fight, did ſet fire to all the Townes y• were
in the Ilande, ſo that the whole Iland was deſtroyed. The
next day following, Eranciſco de Alburquerque went to
another Iland called Charanaipin, which was belonging to
a Caymall, ſubiect to the king of Coching, who ſerued in al
theſe warres with the King of Calycut. Concerning whom
by certaine ſpyes that the King of Coching had in that Iland,
he vnderſtood that he had made himſelfe in a readines,
to defend himſelfe againſt the Captaine generall, hauing redie
in armes thrée thouſand Nayres of the which were ſeauen

                     〈…〉
                   and fortie with ſhot, besides all their
houſes 
                     〈◊〉
                   with ſundry trenches round about.
Alſo he had by 
                     〈◊〉
                   certeine Paraos with Ordinance in the
ſame, which the king of Calycut had giuen him▪ Theſe wer

                  oat in a certaine harbor, where our men pretended to diſimbarke
themſelues: which were there placed, that they
ſhoulde reſiſt our comming into that place, if that it were
poſſible. About this place there was great ſtore of boates, all
furniſhed with Ordinance: but the enimies at the length,
were driuen to runne away, ſo that our men remained quietly
in the harbour, where there ſtood in the water, yea, euen
vp to their girdles a great number, alwaies 
                     〈◊〉

                  res, and
ſhooting off their arrowes in great plentie. But as one as
our Ordinaunce began to go off, then they deſperat
                     •
                  ly began
to run away and giue place. Howbeit, they 
                     〈…〉
                  , did
ſo ioyne themſelues together, & that in ſuch ſort they gaue
our men inough to do to diſimbarke themſelues for that the
ſame was ſo valiantly by them reſiſted.
               And for all that our men could doe, they woulde reuer
leaue their olde altogether, but by a

                  wordf
                     •
                   and a lyttle
they retired themſelues to their Palme trée or to haue
amongſt them ſuccour: and there what with the hinderance

that our men found by thoſe trées, they defended themſelues
a ſmall time. But afterward they ranne awaye, and that
without order, ſo that our men followed them to the vttermoſt,
in eſpeciall the Conſtable of Franciſco de Alburquerque,
whom they call Pedro de lares, who found himſelfe alone
with thrée Nayres which came toward him. The one
of theſe ſhot an arrow, which ſtrake him in the breaſt, and
for that he wore a breaſt plate, it did him no harme. And as
the Nayre looſed off his arrow, went off lykewiſe his ſhot,
and ſtrake the Nayre in the breaſt, ſo that he ouerthrewe
him, and afterward ſhot off another péece vpon one of the
others that remained, and killed him alſo. By the third he
himſelfe was hurte in the legge with a certaine weapon,
which they doe call a Gomya, and with the ſame hée that
hurt him would haue run awaye, but at length this Pedro
lares, killed him with his ſword. Thus all the enimies béeing
put to flight, Franciſco de Alburquerque did then determine
to march toward the Caymalls houſe, wher he had
gathered together all his force, which was ſomewhat ſtrong
by rea
                     •
                  on of certaine trenches that he had made about the
ſame. The Captaines were diuided on both ſides of the Iland,
and each of them had their men with them, and in the
middes of the Iland were placed thoſe of Coching. In this
order they went all burning and ſpoylyng ſuch Townes as
there were, and that without any reſiſtaunce. Going in this
order, there came certaine Paraos from Calycut on that ſide
of the Ilande which Edwarte Pachecho had the charge off,
who for yt they were many in number did leape a land, & encounter
with ye foreſaid Edwarte Pachecho, & had giuen him
the ouerthrowe, (if Franciſco de Alburquerque had not
bene) who came thether with thoſe that he had in charge.
And for that he found greater reſiſtaunce in his Enimyes,
then he looked for, and alſo being ſomewhat afearde leaſt
the Caymall would haue come thether to ſuccour the reſt,
which if he had ſo done, would haue put him in daunger:
he therefore commanded▪ 
                  Nicholas Coello to take with him
Antonio del Campo and Pedro de Tayde, and to ſet vpon

the Caymals houſe,The Caymal ſlaine in defending his houſe valyauntlye▪
                   who was there ſlaine in defending himſelfe
valyantly. At that time manye more of his companye
were both ſlaine and hurt, the houſe was lykewiſe ſpoyled
and ranſakt: of our men were hurt eightéene, and one onely
ſlaine. In the meane while that this was a doing, Franciſco
de Alburquerque and Edwarto Pacheco, did put to
flight thoſe of the fléete of Calycut, many of them lieng along
the water ſide ſorely hurt and ſlaine, the others hadde
inough to doe to imbarke themſelues in their Paraos, in the
which afterward they fled away. And in remembraunce of
ſo great a victory as this was,Knights made after a valiant victorie. 
                  Franciſco de Alburquerque
made certaine Knights, for that through their manhood the
victory was obtained, for of thrée thouſand Nayres the Caymall
had, the leaſt part eſcaped: and the Iland was all deſtroyed
with fire and ſword: and thus after this ſorte was
the King of Coching well reuenged ouer his enimies.
            
            
               ¶Of the warres which Franciſco de Alburquerque
began to make againſt the Lord of Repelyn: and
how by the King of Cochings licenſe, a Caſtle
was begun to be made called Manuel. Chap. 58.
               
                  ALl this being ended, then determined Franciſco
de Alburquerque to make wars againſt
the Lord of Repelyn. And to begin
the ſame, he departed with his other Captaines
in the night toward a towne of his
which is foure leagues from Coching, whether
he came the next day about eight of the clocke. To receiue
him, there were placed along ye water ſide welny two
thouſand Nayres, of the which ther were fiue hundred bowmen.
Our men being come within a Baſe ſhot of the land,
began to ſhoote off in ſuch ſort, that the enimies were driuen
to giue place, and retire vnto their Palme trées, who
being there, did tarie the comming of Franciſco de Alburquerque.
                  
He being diſimbarked, with the reſt of his company
did giue the onſet vpon the enimies, hauing Nicholas
Coello with his men in the forward, and after him marched
the reſt of the Captaines. At the firſt meeting were ſome of
our men hurt with them 
                     〈◊〉
                   which they ſhot ſtanding
behinde their Palme trees, which to them were a very good
bulwarke. Our men, ſéeing that as they were, and hauing
thoſe trees for their defence, they could not make them to remoue,
did then remoue themſelues, and got on the one ſide of
them, ſhooting at them with their Croſſebowes and Caléeuers
with the which there were ſome ſlaine, and the reſt fled
away vnto their Townes, after whom our men followed ſo
eagerly, that there was made a great ſlaughter, yea, farre
greater then in the fieldes, for that there they were ſperpeled
& héere they tooke them altogether in their ſtréets, where
they might the better deale with them. The Towne being
left alone, was immediately ſet a fire, the ſpoyle therof was
giuen to thoſe Nayres of Coching which went with him:
this rewarde Franciſco de Alburquerque gaue vnto them,
that they ſhoulde not thinke his comming into the Indias,
was to robbe any man, but rather to reuenge ſuch iniuries,
as were ſhewed to the King of Coching.
               
               Now at his returne with this victory, he was ioyfullye
receiued at the Kings handes,The king of Coching thinketh him ſelfe ſufficiently reuenged of his enimies. who requeſted him, not to
trouble himſelfe any farther, for that he iudged himſelfe to
be well reuenged. But he aunſwered him, that although
his highnes was ſatiſfied, yet he was not ſatiſfied, but requeſted
him to giue him yet for her licenſe, for yt he accounted
it not any pains to fight in his ſeruice. Howbeit he ſéeing
yt the king was contented, did then aſke him licenſe to
buyld a Fort of timber, foraſmuch as after that he wer gone
for Portingale, there might remaine the Kinges Factor
                     •
                  eſure
and without feare, and all ſuch as ſhoulde be lefte
in the ſame. And this he declared to be the greateſt ſeruice
he coulde doe to the King his Maſter, to conſent therevnto.
               To this requeſt the King aunſwered, that his deſire

was to ſerue the King of Portingale,
                  Heere the king of Coching g
                        •
                     ue licenſe to Franciſco Alburquerque to build a Fort in Coching. with a greater matter
then that was, for that he muſt needes confeſſe, that by
his meanes, he was reſtored vnto his Kingdome of Coching
againe. And therefore he willed him to make the
ſame, and what els he would: and if that néede were, he
woulde commaund it for to bée made at his owne coſt and
charge.
               This licenſe being graunted, with the conſent of the
other Captaines, it was thought good the ſame to be made
harde by the riuer of Coching, right ouer againſt the Citie
within the lande, for that there it was thought moſt ſureſt,
and from thence they might beſt reſiſt the comming of the
King of Calicuts Fléete. And for that they had neither lime,
ſtone, ſande, nor anye other neceſſaries therevnto, hee was
driuen to make the Caſtle of timber, which the King commaunded
to be cut in great plentie, as well Palme trées, as
of other timber. He ſent alſo many of his men for the furtherance
of the worke, ſaieng, that he would not haue anye
of our men to labour, for that as yet the troubles were ſufficient
that they had ſuſtained in the warres paſt. But for
all that, the Captaine generall wold not let, but cauſe them
to worke.
               The Captaynes were de

                  ded with theyr men, and beganne

                     •
                  . It was a great pleaſure to
ſée, with what diligence our men did labour: inſomuch,
that it was ſayde there, that there were no ſuch men in the
worlde againe, as ours were, for that they ſerued for all
aſſ
                     •
                  yes.
            
            
               ¶How the Fort of Coching was made an ende off:
and how Franciſco de Alburquerque and Alonſo
de Alburquerque retourned againe vppon
the Lord of Repelyn. Chap. 59.
               
                  
                  FOure dayes after that the Forte
was begun, came thether Alonſo
de Alburquer
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                     , who by meanes
of the great ſtormes & other foule
weather, coulde not come ſooner:
notwithſtanding he brought all
his men with him in health, of
the which, Franciſco de Alburquerque
was very glad, and immediately
departed a péece of the
Fort to be made by his men, and hy this his comming, the
Fort was made an ende off in a ſhort time:A deſcription and comendatiō of the Forte of Coching. which being
as it was, made of timber, was as ſtrong & faire as though
it had bene made of lyme and ſtone. It was builded ſquare,
and within the walls from the one ſide to the other, it was
ſquare euery way nine fathome. The walls were made of
two orders of Palme trées and other ſtrong timber, firmely
ſet into the ground, and yoked together with hoopes of yron,
and nayled with great nayles. Betwéene the two orders of
trées, they were rampered vp with much earth & ſande, and
at the ende of each of theſe Corners, wer builded bulwarks,
which were repleniſhed with Ordinaunce. Alſo there was
caſt about the ſame a Caue or Ditch, which alwaies was
full of water. The next daye after that this Fort was ended,
there was made a ſolemne Proceſſion, in the which,
went the Vicar of this Forte, who rarried in his hande a
Crucifix vnder a Canapie, which the Captaines caried ouer
him, ſounding before the ſame their Trumpets, with great
ioye. With this ſolemnitie they entred into ye Caſtle, which
the Vicar did bleſſe. And by commaundement of the Captaines,
they cauſed the ſame to be called Manuel, in perpetuall
memory of the King Don Manuel, vnto whom all thoſe
that made the ſame were ſubiects. The Fort being bleſſed,
ther was a Maſſe ſang, at ye which ther was alſo a Sermon
made by Frier Gaſton, wherein was made mention how
much they were bound to giue God great thankes, yt would

permit and condeſcend, that from ſo ſmall a kingdome as
that is of Portingale, and lieng on the cape of the Occident,
there ſhould goe Portingales to a land ſo farre of, as are
the Indias, and to make there a fort amongſt ſuch a multitude
of enimyes vnto the Catholike faith. And that by the
clemencie of God, this ſhould be but a beginning of many
others. Alſo he made mention how greatly bound they wer
to y• king of Coching, for ye good ſeruice y• héerin he had done
to the king theyr ſouereigne: which words béeing brought
to ye king of Coching,

ye generals thanks for ye ſame. After all this they returned &
followed their warres againſt all ſuch as were enimies to
the king of Coching, and beſet certeine townes which wer
along the coaſt, fiue leagues from Coching, the rather for
that they were aduertiſed by their ſpies, that thoſe Nayres
that ſhould kéepe the ſame, were but few in number. They
carried with them for that place ſeauen hundred men, and
departed two houres before day, notwithſtanding it was
nine of the clocke before they came thether, in the which
townes there were more then ſixe thouſand ſoules, ouer &
beſides children, and ſuch Naires as were there in gariſon,
which were thrée hundred, and thoſe all bowmen, Alonſo
de Alburquerque, with other of the Captaines leapt a
land hard by the firſt towne: & Franciſco de Alburquerque
wt the others into the other towns, which were a Fawlcon
ſhot off. In the firſt they tooke the enimies vpon a ſodeme,
with the feare thereof they made them runne awaie, for
that immediatly as ſoone as they landed, they ſet fire vnto
them all.
               Our men ſeeing the enimies to runne awaie, went after
them,At the alarome ſoū

they deſtroied the countrie. In the meane while the larome
was raiſed, and for that this Ilande was well inhabited,
there was aſſembled together well nigh ſixe thouſande
Nayres, which did ſet vpon our men at theyr imbarking, ſo

                  , &
by yt meanes he was the firſt that came to the towne, & that
a great deale before day. And being weary with ſtaieng for
the reſt of his companye, he commaunded to ſet fire to the
towne, with intent to burne the ſame: & for that the enimies
were vnprouided for his cōming, he ſuppoſed he might therfore
doe the ſame the better, and ſo he did. The enimies ſéeing
the fire, aroſe forthwith to quench the ſame, which our
men perceiuing, did ſet vpon them, & ſlew ſome, & the others
ranne their wayes. Thus they did for that they were of a
baſe kinde of people and poore, and without weapons. The
Naires knowing that it was our men that had ſet ye fire,A baſe minded & cowardiſe kinde of people▪
                  
came thether all ſuch of them as were in gariſon within ye
towne, which were more then two thouſand, who being together,
did ſet vpon our men very deſperatly, inſomuch that
Alonſo de Alburquerque with his men, was driuen to retire,
for that they were no more then fortie, of ye which ther
was one ſlaine, & of the others there were ſome hurt with
their arrowes They had all of them hardly eſcaped, if ſo be
that they had not retired, which was done not without great
trouble. And yet he could not haue done ſo much if the boys
of the ſhips which remained in their boats, had not ſet fire
to a Fawlcon, for feare of the which, as ſoone as the ſame
was ſhot of the enimies aparted themſelues. By this time
it was day light, at the which came thether Franciſco de
Alburquerque, who whē he had knowledge what had paſt,
commaunded to be ſhot of all the ordinance that the boats
carried, which made the enimies to flie from the ſhoare.
Whileſt they were thus doing, Edwarte Pacheco did determine
to leape a land, ſomwhat farther of from the others, &
going forth to doe ſo, he found ther many Naires wt theyr
weapons, which had paſt by a narrow way, to ye intent to
ſuccour their felows. As ſoone as he had ſight of thē, he commanded
to bring his boat hard to ye ſtreight, where wt his
ordinance he did hinder and keepe that paſſage. Then immediatly
came thether our men, which forthwith did, leape
a land, & ſetting vpō their enimies, inforced thē to rū away:

and for that they knew not the countrie they followed them
not,The enimies tovvne ſet on fire▪
                   but did ſet fire to the towne. Then Edwarto Pacheco, &
Pedro de Taide did part themſelues with their men to go
and burne another Towne which ſtoode a little aboue the

                     •
                  ther, and in the way they met with eightéene Paraos, all
armed, of the king of Calycuts, which they did put to flight,
and the towne being burnt, as they before had determined,
they returned to their Generalls. And for that it was ſomwhat
rath for to returne, they went to the Iland of Cambalan▪
                  
minding to deſtroie ye ſame, for that the Caimall was
enimie to the king of Coching, where they burnt a greate
towne. From thence Edwarto Pacheco, with ſixe Paraos of
Coching, went to burne another towne, but before they
could accompliſh the ſame, they fought a good while with
their enimies, of the which there were ſome ſlaine. The
Towne being ſet a fire, he retourned with his men, of the
which were ſeauen hurt, and béeing retyred, he fought with
thirtéene Paraos of Calicut, which he did ouercome with
the helpe of Pedro de Tayde, & Antonio del campo, which
came thether at that inſtant. The enimies being retired into
a certeine créeke, there went after them Edwarto Pacheco,
and was the cauſe that one of thoſe Paraos ran a ground;
and ſo he tooke the ſame, and in the meane while the others
went their waie. And for that our men that rowed were
wearyed, they went not therefore after them, but returned
vnto their Captaines generall, with whome they went to
Coching.
                  They returne frō purſuing theyr enimies▪
                   And giuing the king an account of that which
they had done, hée yéelded himſelfe ſufficiently contented
with reuenge of his enimies, and prayed them to giue ouer
the warres.

                  NOw by reaſon of theſe foreſaid wars, there
was none that durſt bring one graine of
Pepper to ſell at the Factorie. Neither yet
durſt the merchants goe to ſeeke the ſame
out, and for all that they were able, they
could not get more then thrée hundred Bahares.
And ſo they ſent word to the generalls, willing them
to ſend for it, being nine leagues of from Coching, y• which
they immediatly did, béeing accompanied with all the other
Captaines of the Fléete, for that they ſhoulde goe for the
ſame amongſt all their enimyes. And becauſe they woulde
not be knowne, they departed in the night, and in their way
Edwarte Pacheco did deſtroy an whole▪ Ilande, where hee
with onely thoſe of his owne companie fought with ſixe
thouſand of his enimies, & the Generalls did in the meane
while put to ſlight xxxiiii. Paraos. This béeing done, Edwarte
Pacheco and Antonio del campo, went and deſtroied
a great towne in the firme land, fighting with, & putting
to ſlight two thouſand Naires, of the which ther were many
ſlaine and hurt, and of our men not one. With this victorie
they returned to their Captaines Generall, who ſent
immediatly for the pepper, which was but a lyttle way of,
and being night, themſelues did depart toward Coching,
from whence they were minded to ſend the Tone which
carried the pepper, laden with merchandiſe to giue in truck
of the ſame. And for that it might goe the ſurer, Edwarte
Pacheco was ſent with other thrée Captaines, who carried
each of them fiftie men a péece, & of Coching therwent 500.
Paraos▪ Edwarte Pacheco being departed, did paſſe the foreſaid
ſtraight before it was day, & therfore he was not ſeens,

ther were bow men without number, y• which ſhot at our
men with their arrowes. And if ſo be y• our boates had not

                     •
                  d or fenced with their ſhields a targets, our men
had receiued great hurt, for that the riuer was but narow, ſo
ye with their arrows they might reach them▪ 
                  Edwarte Pacheco
                  
ſéeing that they were ioyned all together, and iudging
that on that ſort they might do them ſome harme, commanded
immediatly one of the Captaines to kéepe y• 
                  Tone,
and he with the other two, & alſo thoſe of Coching did determinatly
come with ye proers of their boats a land, where
there were two thouſand men of the enimies, amongſt the
which he commaunded the Fawlkons to be ſhotte off, the
which did ſo enter amongeſt them all, that with the ſame
there were many torne in péeces, ſo that it made the reſidue
to retire from the water ſide, & there remained place inough
for our men to diſimbarke themſelues without daunger, &
ſo they did. And as the moſt part of them carried handguns,
ſo they did ſet vpon them with the better ſtomacke.
The enimies for all that gaue no place, but ſhot of their arrowes,
which were ſo many in number, that it was thought
that one met in the aire with another. The ſkirmiſh was
valiantly handled of the one ſide,An hot & valiant ſkirmiſh. and of the other, which in
ſuch ſort indured a quarter of an houre, yet notwithſtanding,
the enimie at length did runne away, and left of their
company many ſlaine, the cauſe whereof was, for that they
brought no weapons to offend their enimies withall. Then
our men purſued them to a village, out of the which there
iſſued many Naires, which ioyning thēſelues with thoſe y•
fled away, returned vpon our men with ſuch a ſtomacke
that they ran in great daunger, for that there were of the
enimies wel néere ſixe thouſand men. A great multitude of
thoſe yt were ther, did then as much as they could to go betwéene
the riuer and our men, but to reſiſt them that they
ſhould not ſo doe, and to kill them all, our men defended
themſelues, and repelled them with greate difficultie. And
as the riuer was thus defended, ſo they ran into the ſame, in
the which they ſhewed themſelues to be valiant. And when
they drew néere to thoſe that were in their boates, they ſeparated
themſelues into two ſeuerall places, leauing one
broad way, that our men might the better imbark themſelues,
ſtanding without the daunger of their Ordinaunce,
with the feare of the which the enimyes did ſuffer our men

to imbarke themſelues, whereat there was none either
ſlaine or hurt, which ſéemed to be a miracle.

                  IMmediatly after this was the king of Calicut
aduertiſed of the loſſe of thoſe 
                     
                        •
                     araos,
and alſo of all the ſucceſſe that our men had
in thoſe wars, for the knowledge wherof he
vſed all diligence, in reſpect of the great deſire
he had to turne vs out of the Indias, for
that naturally they could not abide vs. And fearing leaſt that
we ſhuld take their countrie from them,Why the Indias wer moſt earneſt to hunt our men out of their Countrie▪
                   they were ſo much
the more deſirous to hunt vs away. This thing they procured
with great inſtance, and alſo were the occaſion that
we ſhould haue no Pepper. Making this account, that
if ſo be that we ſhould goe without the ſame vnto Portingale,
it would be the occaſion, that we would not retourne
againe to the Indias. By this meanes therfore we were driuen
to prouide for the Fléete in their riuers, and that with
ſuch a number of men, that we could neuer haue aboue a
1200. quintall of Pepper, of 4000. Bahares, that the Merchants
had promiſed, and yet this we got with great ſhot
of Ordinaunce, and hurt of our men, and with infinit ſhedding
of bloud of the enimies.
               In the ende, the king of Calycut found the meanes by
merchants his friends to perſwade with the merchants of
Coching, to giue to the Captaine general no more pepper,
excuſing themſelues with the warres. Which thing was
done in ſuch ſort, that neither with the requeſt of the king
of Coching, neither with anye gifte that was giuen
them by Franciſco de Alburquerque, hée coulde moue

or perſwade them to giue them anye more Pepper. Now
the hope of our men for hauing the ſame anye more in
Coching béeing paſt, Alonſo de Alburquerque with Pedro
de Tayde, and Antonio del Campo, were driuen to
ſéeke for the ſame at the citie of Coulan, which they did the
ſooner, for that they knew that the gouernours of y• Towne
were deſirous of our factorie, the which was offered to Pedro
Aluares Cabrall, and the Lorde Admerall. Thoſe that
thus went thether, were fully bent to make warres againſt
them, if ſo be that they woulde not giue them lading for
theyr ſhips. Alonſo de Alburquerque béeing departed from
Coching with certaine Captaines, came into the port of
the Citie of Coulan, the which ſtandeth twelue leagues
from Coching, and from Comarin xxiiii. the which is beyond
the ſame, bearing toward the South.
               This Citie (as 
                     〈◊〉
                   ſaye) before that Calycut was builded,The diſcriptiō of the citie of Coulā.
was the principall of the Poruince of Malabar, and
the greateſt and moſt principalleſt Port of all that Coaſt.
Notwithſtanding, as yet their houſes be both greate and
fayre, and ſo are alſo theyr Pagodes and Chappells comparable
to theſe of Calycut. Their harbour or hauen is verie
good, they are well prouided of all ſortes of victualls,
the people are in condition lyke vnto thoſe of Calicut.
The inhabitants are Malabars, Gentiles, and Moores,
and the Moores are verie rich and greate merchauntes, in
eſpecially ſince the warres beganne betwéene Calycut and
vs, for many merchauntes of Calycut lefte the ſame, and
nowe dwell there. They doe trade in Coromandyll, Ceilan,

               The king of this countrie is Lorde of a greate Kingdome,
wherin are many great Cities and rich, which haue
belonging vnto them ſundrye goodlye harbours, by reaſon
whereof his cuſtomes are great, and for that cauſe they
are riche of Treaſure, and are able to make a greate
power of men of warre▪ which are for the moſte

breaſts certaine bands of lynnen & of ſilke, with the which
they doe binde them ſo harde, that they are no hinderaunce

of his 
                     〈◊〉
                  , war with the king of Narſinga, which is a great
trouble vnto him. He doth continually or for the moſt part
remain

                   a Citie, the which they doe call Calle. The Gouernours
of Coulan are as it were Aldermen, in the which,
there is a certaine Church, which ye Apoſtle Saint Thomas
builded▪ comming thether to preach the Catholike faith, by
reaſon wherof, there were great numbers that turned Chriſtians,
as well of the Gentiles, as otherwiſe, ſo that of them
there are procéeded from generation to generation the number
of twelue thouſand houſeholders, that are ſcattered abroad
in the Country wher they haue their Churches. The
King of Coulan ſéeing how many were daylye conuerted,
and the daunger thereof, did baniſh him out of his Countrey,
who being thus gone, went to a Citie called Malapur,
lyeng along that Coaſt, and is parcell of the Kingdome of
Narſingas. And yet being there, for yt he was ſo followed by y•
Gentiles and by ye Chriſtians of Coulan, did apart himſelfe
to ye Mountains,S. Thomas baniſhed ye country▪
                   wher they affirme yt he dyed, & from thence
he was brought to be buried in Coulan, in a vante yt was
made in the foreſaide Church. This Church is now ouergrowen,
with b
                     •
                  ſhes and woodes, for that the Citie is diſinhabited,
onely there remaineth a poore Moore, which doeth
kéepe the ſame, for that there are no Chriſtians néere vnto
it: and there he liueth vppon the almes of all thoſe yt commeth
thether in Pilgrimage, aſwell of Chriſtians as of the
Gentiles, for ye Moores doth not let to giue their almes likewiſe
vnto him, for that he was buried in their Countrey.
Alonſo de Alburquerque being come to the harbor of this
citie, & the Gouernours hauing knowledge therof, they came
to viſite him a boord his ſhip, where within the ſame there
was ſetled a peace, y• which was made vpon condition, that
we ſhould haue our Factory in the Citie, & alſo ſhould haue

as much lading of ſpices and other commodities,The conditions of the peace made vvith the inhabitāts of this Citie. as would
lade preſently thoſe ſhips, the which immediatly they went
about to prouide. In the meane while that our men were
there, and whileſt that the one ſhip tooke in his lading, the
other two kept abroad in the ſea, to watch all ſuch as paſt
by from other places and thoſe that they could diſcrie, were
brought, ſome with their good wills, and others there were
brought againſt their wills, to ſpeake with Alonſo de Alburquerque,
and to ſhew him obedience as to a Captaine
general of ye king of Portingales. He offered no hurt to any,
but onely to the Moores of the red ſea: for all ſuch of them
as he tooke, he would cauſe their ſhips firſt to be ranſacked,
and afterward to be burnt, in reuenge of that they had done
to Pedro Aluares Cabrall, of the which thoſe of Coulan
were greatly afraid. The houſe for the Factorie béeing finiſhed,
and the ſhippes laden, Alonſo de Alburquerque lefte
there for Factor, one Antonio de Sala, with two ſcriueners,
the one called Rodrigo Aranſo, and the other Loparabelo:
and for interpretour one called Madera, and two Friers
for Chaplaines, with others, the which in all were xx.
And ſo leauing them in peace, he departed toward Coching.
               
            
            
               How the Captaine Generall departed for Portingale,
and how he left in the Indias for Captaine Generall
Edwarte Pacheco. Chap. 63.
               
                  ALL theſe things remaining in this
order, there was ſent a meſſenger to
Franciſco de Alburquerque from
Coſebiquin, a Moore of Calicut,
which was a greate friend of ours,
as I haue before declared, ſignifieng
that the king of Calicut was determined
to ſet vppon Coching, immediatly
after he was gone to Portingale,
and ſo take the ſame, and to fortifie it in ſuch ſorte,

that he might defend the entering into the harbour, whatſoeuer
armie ſhould come. And for the furtheraunce of this
enterpriſe, he had gotten the good will of all the nobilitye
of Malabar, and that alſo for certeintie it was bruited, that
the king of Cananor and the king of Coulan would ſecretly
aide him. Ouer and beſides all this, that the Merchauntes
Moores did offer him great helpes toward the ſame. After
the ſelfe ſame ſorte, did Franciſco Reynel write vnto him a
fewe dayes after, and how that the king of Calycut was
preparing of ſouldiers, beſides that hée had commanded much
ordinaunce to be made, and that the Moores of Coching were
greatly in his fauour, and therfore he did aduertiſe him not
to truſt much vnto them: within two daies after the receipt
of theſe letteres, the king of Coching wēt to viſit Franciſco
de Alburquerque, and after the ſame manner told him that
which he had learned of certeine Bramenes that came from
Calycut, and willed him to beware & to foreſée what daunger
he was in to loſe Coching, if ſo be that ther did remaine
no armie of defence for that purpoſe. Laieng further before
him, how many daungers he had bene in for the mainteinaunce
of our friendſhip, and for that cauſe his owne ſubiects
had riſen againſt him, and that nowe they minded to
doe the like. Yet notwithſtanding he had ſuch a hope in our
men, and our helpe, that he deſired none other ſuccour for to
defend him from his enimyes, whereof he praied him not
to ſay him nay.
               VNto this,The generals cōfortable aunſvvere vnto ye king of Coching. 
                  Franciſco de Alburquerque, aunſwered him,
that if ſo be that he did well knowe whether hée hadde
gotten, by ſuch loſſes as hée hadde receiued, for the fauour
which he had ſhewed vnto our men, he would receiue other
greater loſſes if it were poſſible. For ſetting a ſide the great
renoune and fame which he hadde gotten of a true and
valiaunt Prince, hée hadde alſo recouered for a friende the
king of Portingale, which is Lorde of ſuch ſubiects as hée
hath ſéene, who alſo are his to obeye and ſerue him in all
thing, when néede ſhould require.

And farther, that they would with ſmall trouble make him
Lord of greater cities then Coching, and that alſo he might
beléeue, that euen as they did reſtore him vnto his eſtate,
euen ſo they would conſerue him in the ſame. And although
that there were made with the King of Calycut the greateſt
peace that could be, yet he ſayde he had ſo ſmall a confidence
in his dooings, that he would not leaue him without
an armie of ſhips, before that he departed from the Indias,
for that he did well know, how little truth that King vſed.
And if ſo be, that vntil this time he had diſſembled with him,
it was onely to ſée whether by this meanes he might lade
his ſhips, for otherwiſe he could not do it, in eſpeciall ye time
being as it is ſo néere ſpent.
               
               With this aunſwere, the King was ſatiſfied: and ſince
that Franciſco de Alburquerque could haue no more Pepper
then that he had, which was but a ſmall quantitie, hée
determined to depart toward Portingale, but firſt he would
nominate him that ſhould remaine in the Indias for Captaine
generall, that the King of Coching ſhould vnderſtand
the ſame. And for that he knew, that he that was appoynted,
would thinke it very dangerous to remaine there, with
ſo few men as he was able to leaue him, he durſt commit
it to none of his Captaines. Howbeit after that he had offered
the ſame to them all, and they were not willing to accept
it,Edwarte Pacheco apointed Captaine generall for the Indias▪
                   laſt of all he gaue the gouernment to Edwarte Pachecho,
who did accept it with a great good will, more for to
ſerue God and his king, then for any profite he knewe that
hée ſhould get in remaining in the Indias.
               
               And when it was once ſpread abroad & knowne to the
king of Coching, that Edwarte Pacheco was he that was
appointed, he was well pleaſed therewith, for that he hadde
heard before of his valour. This being concluded vppon,
Franciſco de Alburquerque made ſaile, carrieng with him
all the reſt of the Fléete. But firſt he gaue the king to vnderſtand
that he did carry the ſame no further then to Cananor,
for becauſe of the Fléete of Calycut, which might encounter
with him, and ſo worke him ſome diſpleaſure in his

Port, where he minded to ſtay (as he did) procuring the lybertie
of Rodrigo Reynel and the others that were there.
This determination being knowen to the King of Calycut,
he ſent him word, that it were not requiſite that hée
ſhould haue him away, but rather offered him, if ſo be that
he would tarrie, to giue him the Pepper that he had promiſed
to delyuer. But hearing this, he ſuppoſed that he gaue
the ſame out, that Rodrigo Reynel with the others, ſhould
be the more deſirous to remaine in the Indias. At this inſtaunt
came in Alonſo de Alburquerque which retourned
from Coulan, and the time being ſpent, he would not tarrye
there any longer, but with the reſt went toward Cananor.
And being there arriued, there came a letter from Rodrigo
Reynel, in the which he wrote vnto him, that the King of
Calycut was certainly bent to ſet vpon Coching, immediately
after that he were gone. And that all thoſe diſſimulations
which he did vſe in offering to giue him Pepper, was
but for feare he had conceiued that he would haue burnt his
ſhips, which were as then in his harbour. This newes the
Captaine generall kept cloſe to himſelfe, that the ſame ſhuld
not come to ye eares of Edwarte Pacheco, vnto whom was
lefte the ſhippe in the which he went, and two Caruells, of
the which were Captaines Pedro Raphael and Diego Pieres,
beſides a ſhippe boate.
               Alſo they lefte him foure ſcore and tenne men, and thoſe
whole, that were néedfull, for all the reſt were ſicke. Alſo,
there was left him, the moſt parte of the Ordinaunce, with
the moſt parte of the munition that they were able to ſpare.
Now being knowen to them all, of the great power that
the King of Calycut had in a readineſſe, they did then meruayle,
that Edwarte Pacheco would accept the ſame, in eſpecially,
for that he remayned with ſo ſmall a Fléete. Some
therefore there were that gaue out and ſayde, God haue
mercie vpon Edwarte Pacheco, and thoſe that doe remayne
with him: ſuppoſing that in very déede, he ſhoulde not eſcape.
               And although theſe words were ſpoken within his hearing,

hearing, yet for all that he would not but tarrie. The Captaine
Generall béeing diſpatched, did depart towardes Portingale,
the laſt of Ianuarye, in the yeare of our Lorde
1504.1504▪
                  
               
               The firſt that made ſaile was Alonſo de Alburquerque,
                  They depart from the Indias and ſaile tovvardes Portingal▪
                  
                  Franciſco de Alburquerque, and Nicholas Coello
that departed afterwarde, were caſt awaye, Pedro de Taide
was driuen to Quyloa, and entering vppon the Barre,
his Shippe was there caſt awaye, with the moſt parte
of his men, by meanes whereof hée went to Monſanbique
in a Zanbuco, where afterwarde hée dyed. Hée lefte
there a Letter written of all his ſucceſſe, and alſo declaring
in what eſtate the Indias did remaine, which hée commaunded
to bée deliuered to any Captaine that ſhould come
thether from Portingale.
               
               
                  Alonſo de Alburquerque, and Antonio del Campo
came to Liſhborne the thrée and twentéeth of Auguſt,
in the yeare aboue ſayde, and tolde the King of the eſtate of
the Indias, who alſo preſented him with foure hundred
weight of the greate ſéede of Pearles, which is called
Alhofer or Ragges, and with 144. pounde weight of great
Pearle, of greate eſtimation, and eight Oyſters, in the which
the ſame do grow: and alſo a Diamond Tablet, the which
was as bigge as a greate Beane, beſides many other iewells,
and alſo two horſes out of Perſia, the which were great
runners.

chap. 64.
               
                  FRanciſco de Alburquerque béeing departed towardes
Portingale, Edwarte Pacheco which remained for
Captaine Generall in the Indias, hauing a while ſtayed

in Cananor to take in there his victualles, brought himſelfe
vnder ſayle, and came to an Ankor without the point
of Cananor, and from thence hée ſent Pedro Raphaell
to goe a long the Coaſt, and to cauſe all ſuch Shippes as
he coulde diſcrye to beare with the Captaine, and to reknowledge
him for their Generall. At this inſtaunt was
Diego Pieres a newe rigging of his Caruell in Coching.
And all theſe Shippes that were brought before the Generall,
gaue an account whether they were bounde, and
what they carryed, and alſo of whence they were. And if
ſo bee that hée founde anye Pepper, hée woulde take the
ſame, as hée did from ſome other ſhippes that were bound
to Calycut, in the which order hée vſed ſuch rigour, that
afterwarde hée was feared of all men.
               Whileſt hée was thus at an Ankor, there came vppon
him in the night a Fléete of twentye and fiue Saile of
Shippes, which vppon a ſodeine made him to coniecture
that they were of Calycut. And ſéeing himſelfe in ſuch
daunger, hée commaunded to let ſlippe their Gabells by
theyr Halſis, for that vppon ſuch a ſodeine they coulde not
weye theyr Ankors with theyr Capſteines, and with the
ſame he cut and made his courſe into the Sea, to bring
himſelfe in the winde of thoſe Sayles, vppon whome hee
commaunded to ſhoote off all his Ordinaunce. And as they
were ſhippes laden with Rice, ſo ranne they their waye as
faſt as they coulde. Some there were that ranne a grounde,
and more hurt had bene done, had it not béene for a greate
ſhip of the Moores that came in their company,A valiant ſkirmiſh vvith an hot ſhip of the Moores. in the which
were well néere to the number of 400. Moores, that were of
the kingdome of Cananor. Theſe thinking that they might
take our ſhippe, came ſodeinly vppon them, alwaies ſhooting
of their arrowes, and we aunſwering them likewiſe with
our Ordinaunce. This ſkirmiſh continued till it was almoſt
day, and then they tolde what they were. After that Edwarte
Pacheco had thus well beaten him with his Ordinaunce,
with the which were nine of his men ſlaine, beſides
many that were hurt, they tolde what they were.
               
                  
And for that there durſt not paſſe anye Ship by for feare
that they ſhuld be taken, the Captaine Generall departed towards
Coching, and in the waye he fought with certeine
ſhips of the Moores, ſome he burnt, and others hée tooke, beſide
thoſe that were ſunke. Thus with greate victorie hée
arriued at Coching, and landed at the Caſtle, where he vnſterſtoode
by the Factour, that the newes of the preparation
that the king of Calycut had made for the warres was moſt
true, and that the king of Coching ſtood in greate feare
thereof, for that the Moores that were inhabitantes of Coching,
were againſt their king for the mainteining of theſe
warres againſt the king of Calycut. The next day following
the Captaine Generall went to viſite the king of Coching,
carrieng his boats with him well armed and fenced,
with certeine paueiſes made of Boordes, and ſette with
Flagges, beſides certeine Ordinaunce which they had in the
ſame, with the which he ſhewed himſelfe to be verye ioyfull,
the rather that the king might take occaſion to be merrie:
who after that he vnderſtoode how ſmall a fleete there
was left to defend his countrie withall, he could not bée but
verye penſatiue,What great feare ye king of Coching vvas put into by his traiterous ſubiects. and ſayde vnto the Captaine Generall,
that the Moores of Coching hadde tolde him that hée did not
remaine in the Indias to defende him from the king of
Calycuts power, but to gather together the Merchaundiſe
that were in the Factorye in Coching, and in the Factors
cuſtodie, with all thoſe that were there, and ſo to carry them
all to Cananor and Coulan.
               
               And therefore hée earneſtlye requeſted him to tell him
if it were ſo or not, for hée did thinke the ſame to be true,
by reaſon that there was lefte ſo ſmall a Fléete. Which
the rather alſo made him to doubt that hee would not tarrie
to fight with the king of Calycuts power, but woulde
doe as the Moores hadde tolde him, wherefore hée prayed
him to aduertiſe him of the truth thereof, for that if it were
ſo, hée might in time ſéeke his reuenge, although as then hée
ſhould hardlye finde the ſame, ſince he had no further
helpe.

The Captaine Generall perceiuing the diſtruſt that the
king had, was offended therewith, and aunſwered him,
ſaieng.
               I Doe much meruaile of thée (conſidering that thou haſt
ſo great experience of the fidelitie of the Portingales)
that thou doeſt aſke me whether I doe remaine for ſo traiterous
an act,The aunſvvere vvhich the Captaine Generall made to ye king of Coching. as this is, that in ſuch a time I ſhould do as
the Moores haue told thée, & thou wilt beléeue them, knowing
that they are ſo greatly our enimies. Thinking that
thou vnderſtanding of this, ſhouldeſt not bring in queſtion
ſuch a matter out of all reaſon. And if ſo be that Franciſco
de Alburquerque would haue done any ſuch thing, it
had bene a great deale better that he with all his Captains
had done it, and not haue left me alone to do the ſame, & to
runne in daunger, and to méete on the ſeas with ſo great a
fléet of the kings of Calicut, for them to ſet vpon mée only.
And if it were ſo that I ſhould haue remained for to haue
done ſo foule a déede, yet I would haue tolde thée thereof,
that I had ſo meant to doe, for that I was afearde of the
king of Calycuts power. But for that I doe take thée to be
a man indued with reaſon, I did ſuppoſe that thou wouldeſt
not haue thought ill thereof. For otherwiſe thoſe béeing
warned thereof, it might haue bene very profitable vnto
thée, to haue remained frée from the enuie and mallice of
the king of Calicut. Which thing if ſo be that the Moores
had conſidered of, they would not haue tolde thée ſo great a
fable. Beleeue me, if they could haue done thée a greater iniurie,
they would haue done it, for the good will thou doeſt
beare vnto vs. This I doe knowe very well, but let not
that trouble thée. For although thou doeſt looſe them, and
all the reſt of thy ſubiectes, yet thou doeſt recouer me, and
as many Portingales as héere remaine, who all will die in
thy ſeruice if it were néede, for that is the onely cauſe wée
did remaine in the Indias, and in eſpecially: for there was
no man that bound me therevnto, if ſo be y• I wold not, but
only the fidelitye & truth which thou haſt alwaies vſed towards

our men vntill ſuch time as thou diddeſt looſe Coching,
and diddeſt ſée the ſame burnt. For the which cauſe
thou oughteſt to eſtéeme the better of thy ſelfe, for thereby
thou haſt exalted thy fame through all the Countrie, and
therfore thy name wil remaine for euer, which is the greateſt
treaſure that kings canne leaue behinde them, and the
onely thing that all men doe ſéeke for. And beléeue me, when
the king of Calycut did firſt ſet fire to Coching, the ſame
was his deſtruction, which was afterwarde well reuenged
vppon thine enimies by the Portingales, & ſo thou ſhalt
now bée as well defended by them. And although thou doeſt
thinke vs to bée fewe and a ſmall Fléete, yet I doe promiſe
thée, that very ſhortly we will ſéeme to bée verye many
by our valyantneſſe. And I hope in God that we ſhall
ſo defend whatſoeuer ſtraight or paſſage the king of Calycut
ſhall enter into,A fevv valiant men are better thē many more naked and cowardly▪
                   where aſſuredly we will tarry and not
remoue our ſelues from thence, neither night nor daye, and
for the paſſages that are ſtraight, our armie is inough, and
therefore it ſkilleth not, there remaine no more for the riuers,
for that theſe are ſufficient. And ſince that they choſe
me to remaine, beléeue certeinly that they did well knowe
they left him that ſhal excuſe thée of thy trauaile, and of the
wearieng of thy men. And therefore be thou merrie and reſolue
thy ſelfe (that by Gods grace) it ſhall not happen now
vnto thée as héeretofore it didde, when thou diddeſt looſe
Coching: for I and theſe that doe remaine with me ſhall
take vppon vs the whole charge and daunger of the
warres.
               
            
            
               How the Moores of Coching prepared to go from
thence: and how the captaine Generall ſtayde
certeine of them that they ſhould not departe,
and what more he did. chap. 65.
               
                  
                  THe king being with this, ſomwhat eaſed &
recomforted, touching that the Moores had
told him, the Captaine general went to ſée
the ſtreights, & to fortifie them, which had
great néede thereof. But they all were wel
furniſhed, ſauing onely the foord, which he
commanded to be fortified with ſtakes, that ther might enter
no veſſells of the enimies. In the meane time he was
aduertiſed by a Letter from Rodrigo Reynel, that a principall
Moore of Coching, and beſides diuerſe others, did procure
all that they could to leaue the citie, that ye king might
remaine alone, & that thervpon this Moore hath come twice
to ſpeake with the king of Calycut in his owne behalfe, and
in the name of the others. This newes troubled the Captaine
Generall a while, howbeit to diſappoint them of their
ſuttle dealing, and that the ſame ſhoulde take no effect, hée
thought it neceſſarie to execute this principall Moore, that
the others might conceiue ſome feare thereof. This béeing
knowne to the king of Coching, he woulde not conſent
therevnto, thinking that if ſo be that he were executed, the
others would make a mutenie immediatly, and then there
ſhuld be no victualls brought into the citie, for that thoſe did
prouide the citie therewith in trucke of their merchandiſe,
and therefore he thought beſt to diſſemble with them all.
The Captaine Generall ſéeing that the king woulde not
conſent therevnto, tolde him that he woulde talke with the
Moores himſelfe, and that he had thought to vſe ſome policie
that none of them ſhould depart out of the citie. But firſt
he commaunded all his owne men to obeye him in all ſuch
occaſions as ſhould be néedfull or requiſite, which commandement
the king alſo gaue out amongſt his ſubiect: this being
done, the Captaine general went with forty of his men
to Coching, to the houſe of this principall Moore called Belinamacar,
who dwelt hard by the riuer ſide, requeſting him
to ſend for certeine Moores which he did name, for y• he wold
conſult with them vpon a certeine matter which did concerne
them all.
               
                  
To whom the Moores came immediatly, for that they wer
afeard of him, and when hée ſawe them all, he ſaide vnto
them.
               I Did ſend for you all,The generals Oration to the Mores cō
                     cerning his abode in the Indias. honeſt Merchants, that you ſhoulde
vnderſtand, wherfore and for what cauſe I remained in
the Indias, for that it is poſſible that all you do not know.
Some there be that doe report that I do remaine to gather
together the Factorie, and ſo to carrie the ſame to Coulan,
and to Cananor: but that you may vnderſtand it is not ſo,
I will therefore tell you the truth. I doe remaine for no
other purpoſe but onely to kéepe Coching, 
                  and if ſo be that
it were néedfull or requiſite, to die my ſelfe, and all thoſe
that doe remaine with me, in your defence, in preſeruing
you from the king of Calycut. And this ſhall be manifeſt
vnto him, if ſo bée that he doe come, for I promiſe you all,
that I will méet with him in the way of Cambalan, wheras
it is tolde me he will enter, and if ſo be there he dare
fight with me, I will not doubt but to take him priſoner,
and carrie him with me into Portingale. Wherefore vntill
ſuch time, as you doe not ſée any thing to the contrarie, I
earneſtly requeſt you that you doe not goe from Coching,
for that I heare that you are minded to goe from thence, &
that you doe allure the reſidue of the inhabitants with you,
for as you are the chiefeſt and principalls, ſo all the common
ſort of people doth follow you. Now I meruaile much y• being
men of ſo gret wiſdome as you are, you wil leaue your
houſes in the which you were borne, & the country wherein
you haue dwelt ſo many yeres, not for feare of any thing
that you haue ſéene, but onely of that which you heare,
which thing for women to doe were verye ill, much more
for you that are men.Hovv fevv Portingals haue vanquiſhed thouſāds of therr enimies. But if ſo be that you would go, when
you ſhall ſéeme in daunger, or elſe runne awaie, I woulde
not blame you, but to goe awaye before you haue ſeene
any of theſe daungers, or anye battaile fought, I account
the ſame, either cowardiſe, or elſe mallice. You doe well
know, that in a manner yeſterday, how few Portingales did

giue the ouerthrowe to thouſands of our enimies, which
now alſo come to ſéeke vs out. And if ſo be that you will
alleadge, that we were more in number then we are now,
indéede it is ſo, for then we fought in open fielde, where it
was neceſſarie there ſhould be many: and nowe in a narrowe
waye, where a fewe ſhall doe as much as though
were many more. And ſince that I can fight, as you haue
well heard of the ſame, for that I haue bene he that haue
done moſt hurt to our enimies (as the king of Coching is
a good witneſſe thereof) I neuer meane to yéelde, who ſhall
looſe more then you all, if I be ouercome. Haue ye therfore
a ſure hope in me, and in thoſe that remaine with mée,
and tarrie vntill ſuch time you may ſée the ſucceſſe of all
things that we doe looke for, and ſince that your king doth
tarrie, why will ye goe your waie? Remember that I and
the others that doe remaine with me, doe ſoiourne in the
Indias ſo farre from our Countrie, to defend the king of
Coching, and you that are his ſubiects and naturally borne
in the Countrie. Will you then forſake him and your countrie?
It were great ſhame for women ſo to doe, much more
for honeſt men as you are. I doe deſire you that you do not
diſhonour your ſelues, nor yet doe to me ſo great an iniurie,
in hauing no confidence that I will defend you: for I
doe giue vnto you all my word, that I will defend you frō
a greater power then any the king of Calycut canne make.
For therefore and for this cauſe was I choſen, and thoſe
that did appoint me to remaine in the Indias, did know of
the warres that the king of Calycut intended, and what
power he had, in reſpect whereof I doe once againe requeſt
you,An hard thretning but polytike and neceſſary. to beléeue that the king of Calycut ſhall neuer ſet his
foot in Coching. Wherefore I deſire you that none of
you doe remoue, for whoſoeuer doth otherwiſe ſhall well
vnderſtand, that if ſo be I may take him I will hang him,
and ſo I ſweare by my lawe. And moreouer I giue you to
vnderſtande, that none of you all ſhall eſcape, for héere in
this port I doe minde to tarrie, watching both day & night.
Now therfore let euery one of you looke to that which ſhall

behoue him, and if ſo be you doe performe that which I
haue requeſted you, doe you then aſſure your ſelues to haue
me for your friend, and if not, for your mortall enimie, and
more cruell then you would wiſh me to bée to the king of
Calycut. And therfore each of you, ſpeak plainly your mind
what you will doe héerein.
               
               This béeing ſpoken, it gaue him occaſion to encreaſe his
cholar, that without any conſideration thereof, hée did ſpeak
ſo lowde, that the Moores with the ſame did double theyr
feare, that they had conceiued of him, fearing indéede that
immediatly he would haue hanged them all. Wherfore preſently
they began to excuſe themſelues, touching that hée
charged them with all, but he woulde not tarrie the hearing
of the ſame, to the intent to put them in greater feare,
but ſent immediatly for his Ship, cauſing it to be brought
to an Ankor, hard ouer againſt Coching, beſides one of the
Caruells, and two of the boates, which he appointed forthwith
to bée ſet in ſuch order, that there coulde none goe out
of Coching by water, but muſt néedes bée ſéene.
               He had alſo many Paraos, which he hadde cauſed too bée
newly rigged, with the which in the night, he watched in
the riuers, which runne round about the citie. Alſo at Sunſetting
he would take all the boats that could carry men or
ſtuffe, and commaund the ſame to be brought a boorde his
ſhip, and to kéepe the watch, and in the morning he returned
them to their owners. With this diligence they of Coching
were ſo feared, that there was none y• durſt go forth
without his liſence, & by meanes of thoſe extremities vſed,
the Moores and Gentiles were quiet, yet for all theſe troubles
that the Captaine Generall had, the moſt part of the
night he would venture a land into Repelyn, in the which
he burnt townes, killed men, and tooke greate ſtore of Cattell
and Paraos, and alſo did them ſundrie other iniuries, at
the which the Moores of Coching much meruailed,they cal ye Captaine Generall a Diuell. namely,
how he could ſuffer ſo great trauaile, and therfore they gaue
out, that he was the diuell.
            
            
               
               How the Captaine Generall made an entrie into
Repelyn, and alſo how he departed towardes
the ſtraights of Cambalan, there to tarrie the
king of Calicuts comming. Chap. 66.
               
                  AT this inſtant was the king of Coching
aduertiſed that the king of
Calicut was come to Repelin, to gather
his power together, and ſo to go
from thence to Coching by the
ſtraights of Cambalan. After ye ſelfe
ſame manner did Rodrigo Reinel,
write vnto him, who lay as then very
ſicke, and afterward dyed, which
the king of Calycut hearing, commaunded to be taken all
that he had. This being knowne to the Moores of Coching
that the king of Calycut was in Repelyn, they wold haue
giuen occaſion to the townes men to haue runne away, but
there was none that durſt venture to doe it, for feare of the
Captaine Generall. Who after that he knew for certeintye
of his béeing in Repelyn, and that all men might vnderſtand
how little he did eſtéeme the king of Calycut and his
power, and armie of ſhips, did one night ſet vpon a towne
of the countrie of Repelyn, at ſuch houres when all were
a ſléepe, and did ſet fire to the ſame. And after that it was
well kindled, our men were knowne, and immediatly there
came many Naires,The captaine generall & his men inforced to retire vnto theyr boates. as wel of the towne, as alſo from other
places thereabouts adioyning. The Captaine Generall was
forced to retire, & that with great daunger, vnto his boats,
with fiue of his men hurt, and of his enimies there were
many ſlaine and hurt, & yet for all that, thoſe enimies that
remained aliue, followed him a good while. And as our men
returned toward Coching, there were ſhot by them ſo many
arrows which fell vpon their boates, that their targets
were all couered with the ſame.
               This being knowne to the king of Coching, that he was
come to the Caſtle, he went to viſit him, for that he accounted

that enterpriſe for a great matter, in eſpecially the king
of Calycut béeing there preſent, who had in a readineſſe ſo
greate and mightie a power, and ſo he ſaide. At the
which the Captaine Generall laughed, and therewithall he
tolde him that he woulde deſire no more but that the King
of Calicut would once come, for that he woulde fight with
him a battaile, and then woulde be apparaunt the valiantneſſe
of his men. They of Coching béeing now all quiet, as
alſo the Captaine general hauing made vnto the principals
an Oration, he prepared his men in a readineſſe for that he
minded to depart to the ſtraights of Cambalan. And in the
meane while he left in the ſhippe xxv. men with the maſter,
which was called Diego Perrera, whom he lefte for Captaine
in his abſence, and alſo as well furniſhed with Ordinance
and ſhot, that they might defend themſelues the better.
The names of thoſe that tarried with him I do omit,
as alſo thoſe that remained in the Caſtle. Thoſe that the
Captaine Generall carried with him, were to the number
of xxiiii. men: and in one of the boats he appointed for Captaine,
him that went for Captaine in the Caruell Santa
Maria, whiles ſhe was a rigging, with xxii. men. The captaine
Generall went in another boate, in the which with
himſelfe there were one and twentie men. Amongſt them
all their number was lxxiii. men, who all both thoſe
that were in the Caruell, and thoſe that were in the boats,
béeing all confeſſed, and hauing receiued the Sacrament,
the Captaine Generall departed to the ſtraights of Cambalan,
                  1504▪
                  
on the Fryday before Palmes Sunday, being the xvi.
of Aprill. 1504.Theſe words the Captaine Generall ſpeake vnto ye king at his departure to vvards the paſſage. Thus departing with great pleaſure, and
with ſhooting of their Ordinaunce, leaping, and dauncing,
when they came ouer againſt Coching, the Generall landed
to talke with the king, which was tarrieng for his cōming
by the water ſide, ſo heauie and ſo ſadde, that he coulde not
hide the ſame. The Captaine Generall making as though
he vnderſtood nothing of it, ſaid vnto him: that thee they
were all ready with great pleaſure and good will, to depart
toward the paſſage, to defend him from the king of Calicut,
                  
whom they went to ſéeke out, that he ſhoulde vnderſtand
that they had no feare of him. The king ſmiled at
theſe words, as it were ſuſpecting his good ſucceſſe. Notwithſtanding,
he appointed him 500. Naires (of fiue thouſande
which he had in armes) of the which he named for Captaines,
Gandagora, and Frangera, which were ouerſéers of
his houſeholde, and Caymal de Palurta, to whome hée gaue
commaundement that they ſhould obey the Captaine generall
as his owne perſon. This béeing done, the king ſtoode
and viewed all our Fléete, who at that time ſhewed himſelfe
to be very heauie, to ſée how few we were in compariſon
of the great power of the king of Calicut, and vppon
the ſame tooke occaſion to ſpeake vnto the Captaine Generall,
ſaieng.
               THere was repreſent vnto him the great danger which
he feared might happen vnto him,the vvords of ye king of Coching to the captaine generall. and that which chanced
to himſelfe this laſt yeare. And therefore doe I deſire
thée, quoth he, to encourage thy ſelfe to doe that which thou
art able, and not to ſuffer thy heart to deceiue thée, but to
remember how much the king of Portingale ſhall looſe in
looſing thée: and with thoſe wordes his eyes ſtoode full of
water, which to ſée, the Captaine Generall was very ſorie,
and ſayd vnto him.The annſvvere the captaine generall made to ye king of Coching.
               
               That better are a few and valiant, then a great multitude
and cowards. And whether (ſayd hée) our men be valiaunt
or not, your ſelfe haue well ſeene, & alſo how contrarywiſe
it fareth with the enimies, your ſelfe likewiſe haue had
experience. He inferred alſo howe in that place where hée
minded to tarrie for his comming, théere néeded but a fewe
to defend him. And therfore he praied him for to be content,
and therewith he departed, and came to the paſſage of Cambalan,
two houres before day, where finding no ſigne of the
comming of the king of Calycut, he went in the meane
while, and did ſet vpon a towne of the ſelfe ſame Ilande
of the Caimalls, where in the dawning of the day he arriued
in the Harbour, a long the which there was appointed.
800. Nayres to kéep the ſame, which were Archers, and

a few with their Caléeurs, which were there tarying for
him. And although thoſe with their calyuers, and the reſidue
with their arrowes, ſhot of at our men, in ſuch maner
that they ſéemed to ſhadow the Element, yet with the
paueices of our boates, the which were made of boards of
two fingers thicke, much like vnto Targets or ſhields, we
did ſo defend them of, that they wer driuen to row toward
the land, which was done for that thoſe yt wer there ſhuld
geue place, yt our men might leap a land. Then ye Captaine
generall cōmanded his ordinance to be ſhot of, with y• which
they lept a land: howbeit, ye enemies returned vpon them, &
therin ſhewed thēſelues to be valiāt, for ye ſpace of an houre.
But afterward they fled apace, & many of thē in the conflict,
at yt preſēt wer both ſlain and hurt at our mens hands. But
after that our men had ſet fire to the towne, and the ſame
was well kindled, the captaine generall did retire, & going
toward the paſſage, in their way they toke and killed much
cattell which they carryed with them: and although the
people of the countrey did defend themſelues very wel, yet
our men being come to the paſſage of Cambalan, the Caymall
ſent to make peace with the captaine generall, with a
certaine preſent, which he would not receiue, neither yet
make peace with him, for that he was an enemie vnto the
king of Coching. Whereupon the next day after, the king
of Calycut ſent him word that he would geue him the battell,Heere the battell vvas offered by the king of Calicut vnto the captaine Generall.
and alſo that he was greatly offended that he had placed
himſelfe where he did minde to enter. And moreouer, it
was tolde him that they did all affirme, that the kinge of
Calycut was like to geue him the ouerthrowe and to take
him priſoner, or els to kill him in the battell.
               To the which the captaine generall anſwered, that the
ſelfe ſame hope he had to doe by the king, the rather in honour
of the daye, which was a ſolemne feaſt amongeſt
the Chriſtians, adding moreouer yt his wytchys had diſappointed
& deceyued him much, to promiſe him the victory in
ſuch a day. Then a certaine Nayre which came with this
Meſſenger, hearing the Captaine generall ſay ſo, anſwered

him, and that with a ſmiling countenaunce, as though
he had mocked him, that there were very few men to doe
y• which he ſpake of: & alſo y• the king of Calicuts men were
ſo many, y• they were ſufficient to couer the whole earth &
the water. Which if it be ſo, how (ſaid he) can they be ouercome.
With this anſwere y• Captaine generall was greatly
offended, & for that he was thought to be one of the king
of Calicuts Nayres, he boxt him well, willing him to bid
the kings of Calicut reuenge the ſame. With the which the
others that came with the meſſage, were ſo greatly afraid,
that they neuer durſt afterward auouch the king of Calicut.
               
               That ſame euening the King of Coching ſent to ayde
the Captaine Generall with fiue hundred Nayres, of the
which he made no account, nor of the others before, for
that he knew they would all run away. In our men,
next vnder God, hée had his confidence and whole truſte,
who all that night made greate feaſte, that the kinge of
Calicut might vnderſtande that they did not feare him,
but rather ſhewed great forwardnes to geue him y• battell,
of the which ye Captaine general was very glad. And therfore
before it was day,The captaine generals words ſpoken vnto his mē. he ſpake vnto al his men in this mā
                  ner.
Maſters and my friends, for the great content that I
doe finde in you. I doe for moſt certain prognoſticate the
great gift yt God in his ſeruice wil geue vnto vs this day.
And I doe beleue for moſt certaine, that as God hath geuē
vs ſtomacke (being ſo few as we are) to dare tary & abide
ſo many thouſands of men as there are of our enemies: ſo
he will geue vs force and ſtrength to reſiſt them, & herein
wil ſhew his great power, & as it were a miracle ſo greate
as this is, in ye exalting of his holy faith: and in his holye
name I do deſire you, that you wil ſo beleue, for yt without
this hope, although we were as many as the enemies are,
and they as few as wee bee, yet all our ſtrength were
nothing, and being in this hope, all the multitude of the
enemies will ſéeme vnto vs but few to ouer come: for
they doe iudge vs to be many more then wee are, their
feare is ſuch. And this alſo you may beleeue, that if their

comming as at this day with their great preſumption bée,
for that they are many, hauing moſt aſſured hope to take vs,
yet they will haue a feare from hence forth, ſo that theyr
ſpirits will be broken, to ſet vpon vs any more, which thing
if they did, it would be more for feare of the king of Calycut,
then for any good zeale they haue vnto him. And therefore
I pray you remember, that with this confidence you
muſt fight, and God ſhall giue you the victorie, and that
with honour of all the Portingales, and a perpetuall fame
amongeſt the ſtraungers, and deſerts before our king, that
he may reward you for the ſame, wherby you ſhall the better
mainteine your ſelues all the dayes of your life.
               
               Vnto theſe words they all aunſwered, that in the battell
he ſhoulde well ſée how well they did remember his
ſpeach. And immedialy they fell vpon their knées and ſung
the Salue regina in tune, & afterward an Aue Maria with
a lowde voice. At this preſent came Larenco Moreno from
the Caſtle, who brought with him foure of his Caléeuer
men, for they would néeds exerciſe themſelues in this battell.
The Captaine Generall was very glad of their comming,
for that they were very valiant.
            
            
               How the king of Calycut gaue battaile vnto the Captaine
Generall in the ſtraights of Cambalan, and
how he had the ouerthrow. chap. 67.
               
                  THis night by the perſwaſion of the Italian
runagates, the king of Calycut commaunded
to be made a plat-forme or ſ
                     •
                  once, on
the which there might be placed fiue péeces
of Ordinaunce, the which might ſtand
right ouer againſt wher the Captaine Generall
was, that from thence they might ſhoote off their ordinaunce,
at what time they meant to giue the onſet, and
for that the ſtraightneſſe of the paſſage was a daunger
vnto him. So on Palmes ſunday the king of Calycut
marched forward, with xlvii. thouſand men, the which were

as wel of the Naires as of the Moores: beſides that he went
accompanied with the king & Caimalls, which were come
vnto him, to aide and ſuccour him, not onelye with their
owne perſons, but alſo with their men. That is to ſay, the
king of Tanor with foure thouſand Nayres:The kings and Caimals that aſsiſt the king of Calicut againſt the Portingales. the king of
Bybar, and of Curran, which is hard by the Mountaines of
Narſinga, with twelue thouſand Nayres: the king of Cotogataco,
which ſtandeth betweene Cananor and Calicut,
hard by the Mountaines, with eightéene thouſand Naires:
The king of Cur
                        •
                     a, which is betwéene Panane and Grangalor,
with thrée thouſand Naires: Alſo Nabeadarin, which
was Prince of Calycut and Namboa his brother, and the
king of Calycut himſelfe, who had a great number, which
for that they were many, I doe not rehearſe. The ſortes of
inſtruments that they had for the wars were ſo many and
diuerſe, that when they began to play vpon the ſame, it was
thought that heauen and earth woulde ioyne together.
Ouer & beſides the great multitude of the people, the which
did couer the whole earth. Thoſe that went in the vangard,
as ſoone as they came to their ſetling, did giue fire to theyr
ordinance, which as they lay néere to the Caruel, ſo it appered
partly a miracle, that there was no péece that did hurt
it. Howbeit our Ordinance béeing ſhot off, did all light full
amongſt the enimies, and killed many of them, although it
was before day, the which vntill Sunne did riſe, were in
diſcharging out of the Caruell, aboue xxx. péeces.
               After all this, the whole Fléete of the enimies beganne
to come out of the riuers of Repelyn, which were 169.
Foyſtes, that is to ſay, thrée ſcore and ſixe Paraos, the which
hadde theyr defence of ſackes of Cotten, which deuiſe was
giuen them by the Italians, that our Ordinaunce ſhoulde
not hurt their men.
               Each of theyr boates or Paraos had two péeces of Ordinaunce
in them, and fiue and twentie men, of the which
there were fiue in euery Parao that had their Caléeuers, and
all the reſt were bow men.
               Alſo there were twentie of theſe Foyſts, all cheined together,

for to ſet vpon the Caruell. Alſo there were liii.
Catures, beſide thirtie greate Barks, each of theſe hadde
his péece of Ordinaunce, and ſixtéene men, which ſerued
in him with ſundry kindes of weapons.
               Beſides all theſe armed veſſells, there went other furniſhed
with men, which béeing all together, it ſeemed that
the whole riuer was couered ouer, in the which Fléet were
well néere x. thouſand men, and of this fléete was Admerall
Nabeadarin, and for Vice Admerall the Lorde of Repelyn.
Certeinly to ſee them altogether vpon the water and
lande, was a greate terrour, all of them béeing halfe naked,
ſome of coulour blacke, and others of a darke Tawnye.
And vppon their weapons the Sunne did ſo gliſter,
that they appeared as though they had béene ſwoordes, and
newly ground, and ſo lykewiſe did their targets, the which
were of ſundrie coulours, and ſhewed very gallant. And for
that our men ſhould ſtand in the more feare of them, they
gaue out great cries and laroms. After this they beganne
to ſound vppon their inſtrumentes of warre, which noyſe
contynued alwayes, nowe after one ſorte, and then after
another.
               Our men bearing amongſt ſuch a multitude, and béeing
in theyr Caruell and theyr boates, coulde ſcarcelye bée
diſcerned, for with the Fléete, they occupyed almoſt all the
paſſage, by meanes of ropes they gaue the one the other,
which ropes were wounde about with cheynes, that they
ſhould not cut them a ſunder. And after that they hadde
done this, commaundement was giuen, to giue fire to the
Ordinaunce, with the which the enimyes were receiued.The Naires of Coching do all run avvay▪
                  
               
               At this inſtaunt thoſe Nayres that were of Coching
did all runne awaye, onely Grandagora and Frangora remained
for that they were in the Caruell: otherwiſe they
woulde haue gone as the others did, which had bene no
matter, but that they ſhould ſée how valiantly our men defended
themſelues in the battell, into the which they went
in a great heate.
               
                  
The Ordinaunce went off ſo often, and lykewiſe the
ſmall ſhot, that there was none that coulde ſee one another,
for the ſmoake of the ſame. The Caruell and the Boates
did ſo flame in fire, and did ſo cruelly handle the enimyes
at the firſt entering, that there were torne in péeces ſome
of their Paraos, and manye of their men ſlaine and hurt,
without any of ours hurt, or ſtanding in any daunger therof
at all. By this time, the enimyes were come, within the
throwe of a Dart. Howbeit, as they were many, and that
without order, the one did hurt and hinder the other, ſo that
they could not fight. Yet notwithſtanding, the xxv. Paraos
that went before, did trouble our men very much with
theyr Ordinaunce which they had, for that they went cheined
together.
               Our men being wearied and hurt, and the battaile
hauing endured a good while, the Captaine Generall
commaunded a Saker to bee ſhotte at them,The enimies vtterly diſcomfited, doe run their vvaye. the which till
that time had not béene ſhot at the enimies. And after that
the ſame was twice diſcharged, they all fledde, and for that
they laye very thicke together, it did immediatlye ſinke
foure of them, and with that they were all ouercome, and
ſo they ran theyr waye. The reſidue of the Paraos which did
continue in the battaile, were eightéene ſunke, and thirtéene
fledde awaye, the reſidue gaue place, in the which
there were of the enimyes greate numbers ſlaine and
hurt.
               After all this came the Vize Admerall called the Lord of
Repelyn, with another ſquadron, and gaue a proud onſet,
ſo did the king of Calycut giue the lyke vpon the land.
This battaile was farre more vehement then the firſt,
in the which were manye more of the enimyes ſlaine,
then before, as appeared by the water which was of the
coulour of bloud. Yet for all this, the Lorde of Repelyn
made lowde outeryes, commaunding them to laye the Caruell
aboorde, but for all that they durſt not venture to
doe it, but rather were deſirous to goe theyr waye, as they
alſo that were a land did the like.
               
                  
It was now at this preſent paſt Euenſong, from the time
the battell did firſt beginne, in the which were of the enymies
ſlaine, not onely by land, but alſo by water. 350. men,
which were knowne, beſides others, the which were aboue
a thouſand: and of our men there were ſome hurt, but none
ſlaine. And although theyr pellets were made of caſt yron,
yet they did no more hurt, then a ſtone béeing throwne.
Howbeit, our defences were all torne in péeces, and one of
our boates alſo, neuertheleſſe, not in ſuch ſorte, but that it
might bée new rigged before that it was night.
            
            
               How the king of Calicut ſeeing the ill ſucceſſe that hee
had in the warres, did enter into councell to leaue the
ſame. Chap. 68.
               
                  THoſe kings and noble men which came to
ſuccour and aide the king of Calicut, perceiuing
that he was thus ouerthrowne,
and that with great loſſe both of his men
& veſſells, although his power were great,
and ours but very ſmal, & that the captain
Generall neuer made any reckoning of the king of Calicut
nor of his force, but for al that did ouerrun the Countrie, &
deſtroyed it, ſome there were of them that made a greate
wonder thereat, & ſayd that our God did fight for vs, whervpon
they loſt all the hope they had for euer to giue vs the
ouerthrowe, and from thence forth they had themſelues in
no reputation, but rather were very ſorie that it was their
euill hap to come in the aide of the king of Calycut. Thoſe
that did moſt repent themſelues of their comming, wer ſubiects
to the king of Coching, for that their countries were
ſcituated along the riuers, which did put them in the more
feare of the Captaine Generall, that he wold ſet fire to their
townes & houſes, or otherwiſe deſtroie them. And for that
cauſe, they determined to leaue the king of Calycut, & wold
make no more wars againſt our men, more thē that which
was paſt alreadie.
               
                  
And vpon this condition, they returned to the king of Coching,
with whom they reconcyled themſelues, and thoſe
that did thus were, one called Marugata, Muta Caymal,
and his brother, and Couſins, who immediatly after the
battaile, did ſo ſecretly depart from the kinge of Calicuts
Campe, from whence they went to the Iland of Vaypin,
to ſtay there, till they might ſee their time, as I haue ſayd.
But when the king of Calicut had knowledge that they
were gone,The king of Calicut much blameth his captaines for being ouerthrovvne by ſo fevv▪
                   and alſo vnderſtoode where they were become,
he was very ſory therefore, which alſo was the occaſion
that he renewed all his griefe, that hee had conceyued for
his ouerthrow, which he had receyued at our mens hands,
that were ſo few. Wherupon he tooke occaſion to rebuke
his captaines, ſaying, that they were good for nothing, and
that through their defaulte our men continued and kept
theſe paſſages. And if ſo he, that they had had any ſhame,
they would or this time haue dryuen them from thence, in
eſpecially hauing geuen ſo often the enterpriſe to paſſe the
ſame. Then thoſe two Italians that were preſente, did
replie vnto the king, that although our men had done moſt
valiantly, yet that which they did was like vnto the dedes
of deſperate men. Notwithſtanding, that they were not able
to defende themſelues long, from ſuch a power as his
was, in eſpecially, not hoping to haue any ſuccour. And
therefore they willed him to ſet vpon them often times,
for by that meanes it was poſſible to take them. Some
alſo of thoſe kinges and noble men that came to ſuccoure
the king, and that were deſirous of warres, did confirme
that which the Italians had ſaide before, addinge moreouer,
that God doth permitte his enemies ſometime to haue
the victorie, for a more greater loſſe vnto them, and therefore
it were good ſaide they, that he followed his friends
counſell, and prooued their ſtedfaſtneſſe. And although it
were ſo, that he had not the victorie immediatelye, yet hee
ſhould not therefore diſpaire. The king finding himſelfe
ſomewhat vexed in minde with thoſe wordes, aunſwered
them ſaying. Although that eche of you is ſo valiant, that

it appeareth vnto you,the kings aunſvvere vnto this aduice. a ſmall matter to ouercome thoſe
Chriſtians, yet I am not ſo obſtinate to thinke the ſame.
Howbeit I ſuppoſe yet, that you doe ſée in me no ſuch a
feare, that thereby you might iudge it néedefull, to ſtrengthen
me with thoſe words. For what can you tell me in
this caſe, that you may ſatiſfie me withall? For if ſo bee,
that you will conſider as much as I doe, you would ſoone
know, how great an acte this is, that you doe make ſo little
accompt off. I doe not take it in vs for ſo great a victorie
in ouercomming theſe Chriſtians, but rather in them,
in defending themſelues from vs, as they haue done. Wher
in it hath well appeared,
                  No doubt but God doeth fight for his ſeruants▪
                   that their God did fight for them.
               And will you ſée how it is ſo? You maye well
conſider, that our men are many, and that they haue bene
valyant in the warres paſt, it hath well appeared in many
and great battailes, wherein I haue ouercome mine enimies,
as you do all well know. But ſince they haue fought
with theſe Chriſtians, they ſéeme to be (not as they were)
nor durſt giue the onſet vpon them, for the feare they haue
conceiued. And certainly, as farre as I can learne, and alſo
all thoſe that are of a good iudgement, we ought to beléeue,
that thoſe workes are rather of God, then of man.
For who is he that would not be afeard of them, wel perceiuing
that all others are? I meane not onely the King
of Cochings ſubiects which came to ſuccour vs, who haue
repented themſelues thereof, but alſo manye other of our
friends, which in the beginning of theſe wars did alſo aide
vs.
               
               
                  And farther, I am enformed by ſome, that they haue
now offered their friendſhip vnto the King of Coching.
Which thing, if it be true, it is for that they haue loſt the
hope they had of any victory on our part, as well for that
which is paſt, as alſo reputing how lyttle time there is
now lefte of the Summer, and alſo for that in the Winter
they cannot remayne anye time to continue in the
Fieldes, becauſe of the great ſtormes and raine, which
would then be.
               
               
                  
                  And in the ende of the winter, then will there come the
Fléete from Portingale, which will doe vs as much harme
as the fléete did the laſt yere, and ſo I ſhall neuer bée out of
vnfortunate miſchiefes, but thus in the end I ſhall be vtterly
deſtroyed.
               
               
                  All this ſhall be that I ſhall gette, with the
loſſe of the friendſhip of the Chriſtians. And it is poſſible
that for theyr cauſes the Pagodes will not aide nor helpe
me as they haue done before time. For although you tell
me, that they doe permit ſometime their friendes to ſuffer
perſecution for their profit,God chaſticeth mē ſometime for theyr trial ſomtime for their offences. do you not thinke the ſame alſo
to happen for their offences, as it is well knowne this
doth for mine. What then ſhall néede any further exhortations,
to cauſe me to doe as you would haue me, and to ſuffer
perſecution for my wealth, ſince I doe vnderſtand what
the ſame meaneth: and for the preſeruing of mine eſtate, it
is requiſite and needfull to haue friendſhippe with the
Chriſtians, if ſo be that you be alſo of the ſame minde,
for that we are all equall in the loſſe, and alſo in the
gaines.
               
               For this talke of the kings, they were all ſorrie that had
giuen him counſell to go forward in theſe wars, ſince that
they perceiued that his intent was to leaue the ſame, and
haue friendſhip with the Captaine Generall. Theſe therefore
would forthwith haue aunſwered, but the Prince Nabeadarin
didde preuent them, who was ſorrie for theſe
warres commenſed, and ſpake thus looking vppon them
all.
               SInce the king doth aſke vs counſell what is beſt to be
done in this matter,The Princes Oration vnto the King & Nobles aſſembled▪
                   which ſtandeth him ſo much vppon,
I as one that moſt of all am gréeued with this loſſe,
and moſt deſirous of his profite, will therefore bée the
firſt that ſhall ſhewe heerein my minde, and what I doe
thinke thereof. In that which you ſaye, that oftentimes the
Pagodes in the time of the perſecutions that we do receiue

will commaund vs to doe that which they will haue vs,
ſo we ought to vnderſtande them, although therefore in
theſe warres it appeareth that it goeth very euill with vs,
and in this they doe ſhew how much they are our frends,
truely I doe beleue the ſame, the rather for that we ought
not to beleue them that would haue a matter done without
reaſon, as it were to geue vs the victorie againſt thoſe
Chriſtians, and power to deſtroy the king of Coching, vnto
whom we haue done very much hurt, killynge the laſte
yeare his Princes and almoſt all his men, ſetting of Coching
a fire, and deſtroying his countrey, from whence
we hunted him away, with his great diſcredite, diſpoſſed
him of his kingdome & ſubiects, ſo that al they for the feare
they had of vs did leaue him, yea his own frendes forſooke
him, & went againſt him, & all for our ſake. And aboue all
theſe euils the which he did not deſerue, for yt he was not in
any fault, we would yet procéed further, vtterly to deſtroy
him. What hath he done? Did hee procure to take anye
mans countrey from him? No. In friendſhip did he vſe
himſelfe traiterouſly? Neither. Did he commaunde the
Marchantes that they ſhould not come to Calicut? Neither,
Did he thē ſome worſe thing ſince he did nothing of theſe?
Nothing at all. What then? forſooth for yt he did receiue into
his countrey the Chriſtians which being driuen out of Calicut,
went to ſéeke him out, as he was deſirous to encreaſe
and enpeople his Citie, and to augment hys eſtate and riches:
Shall we therefore deſtroy him being our friend, as
an enemie? With this right doe the Pagodes helpe vs to
take the honor, riches and credite from the right owner? It
cannot be ſo, for that they be righteous and iuſt, and therfore
they will not help vs agaynſt thoſe Chriſtians which
were ſlayne, robbed, and thruſt out of Calicut, and were
there receiued vnder ſafeconduct from the king, comminge
to his porte before any others, and not geuing cauſe wherfore
they ſhould receiue ſo many iniuries. If wee doe it
for that they laide hande vpon a Shippe of the Moores,
there is no reaſon why, for that the Kinge commaunded

them to ſtay the ſame: And if he had ben aduiſed by al men
as he was by me, the Moores ſhould haue paid for that they
ha done & that very well, for & if they had ben puniſhed, it
wold wel haue appered, yt the king had ben in no fault of yt
which they had done. And this had bene ſufficient to haue
confirmed the friendſhip of the Chriſtians with him, & this
alſo would haue bene a cauſe ſufficient, to haue kept them
in Calicut from going to Coching, to haue there ſetteled a
trade, whom the King through euill councell hath trauayled
ſo much to take them, as though they were théeues that
had robbed him of his owne, they being ſo good, ſo gentle,
ſo valyant as we ſée,Amongſt other vertues grate fulnes cō
                        mended. and beſides ſo gratefull of the benefite
they doe receiue. For the receiuing of them as ye King
of Mylinde did, they gaue ouer two ſhips laden with gold,
the which they had taken from a Couſin of his. If theſe
men were Théeues, as the Moores doe ſay they are, thoſe
were prices not to be left. You know how rich a Preſent
they brought to the King, and what ritch merchandiſe they
brought, and how much golde and ſiluer. Thoſe fiſhermen
which they did carrie away naked, did retourne againe all
apparailed. If then we were friends, how ſurely ſhould we
liue: & what profit ſhould the King haue, if we had amitie
with them. I do not ſpeak of ye ſhip yt carried y• Elephants
which was giuen him: when all y• priſes did paſſe by theſe
théeues hands, the which they left. Theſe were ſeruices to
be thankfully receiued, giuing occaſion to vs to gratifie thē
in like ſort, and to be glad to haue them for our friends, &
ſince we did put them awaye when they had néede of vs,
now that we haue néede of them, let it not be thought euil,
to conclude a peace with them, for that the wars we make
againſt them, we make the ſame againſt our ſelues. They
are vpon the Sea of more power then we are, as you may
well ſée the ſame by the long time they haue defended this
paſſage, and with what power of men, and alſo what deſtruction
they haue brought vppon vs, and are like to doe,
ſince that our Countrey lyeth néere to the water ſide, and
that with our owne loſſe, we haue well ſéene the truth.

Therfore let it go no further, but let vs ſéeke ſome remedie
to haue a peace concluded amongſt vs: for if we haue not, ye
port or harbour of Calicut wil be vtterly vndone, & the king
wil be like to looſe all his rents. This doth concerne him
more then al y• friendſhip of ye Moores, which haue no other
reſpect but only to their owne profit, & not to the kings, &
theſe be they that go giue councell to make theſe warres.

                     ng vvorfs of ye Moores to ye King. The Moores yr wer preſent
hearing al this talk, which was to their contēt, did further
ye ſame as much as in thē lay, ſetting forward ye king,
praiſing him to be inuincible, laieng before him y• infamy he
ſhuld incur, if he did leaue y• wars: they offred him moreouer
their perſons & goods towards ye ſame, alleadging ye increaſing
of his rents with their trade, plenty of victuals in

they haue had with him, & how they were become naturall
inhabitants of his country, with many other things,
vnto y• which ye king wold not anſwere, neither yet his brother,
for yt al thoſe kings & Lords did help ye Moores aduiſe,
& ſo it was concluded yt the wars ſhuld go forward. And for
y• it had gone with ye king ſo euill in y• foord, they found a
new inuention to lay the caruels a boord, which a certeine
Moore of Repelin made called 
                     〈◊〉
                  , who had ben a trauailer,
& ſeene ſundry inuentions deuiſed. And for y• cauſe hauing
a pregnant wit, he inuēted a caſtle to be made of timber,
built vpon two boats or lighters, placing two beames
croſſewiſe ouer ye forepart of the ſaid boats, & the ſterne or
poope of ye boats to be as broad as ye caſtle long, yt which caſtle
was made ſquare, & vpon thoſe beams were other placed,
ſo high as as a chāber from a hall, & in euery ſquare were
quarters of timber thick ſet together, of ye height of a lance,
or little leſſe, mortaſed in ye ſaid beams, & nailed with great
yron nails, & in ye bodies of ye quarters of timber wer holes
made, through ye which went bars of yron. ſo y• to ſight the
caſtle ſéemed a ſtrong thing. In this caſtle might. 40. men
be wel placed, beſides certein péeces of ordinance, ſo that in
this wiſe this caſtle might paſſe ye riuers, & wt grapuls ioyn
wt ye caruels, which being dōe ye king deſired ye ſight therof, &
whē he had ſeen ye ſame, did not only praiſe his wit, but alſo

rewarded him very largely, and by the ſame paterne commaunded
other ſeauen to be made, that vpon them the Caruells
might diſpend their times, & occupie themſelues, thinking
that euen ſo it would be.
            
            
               Of the great alteration there was in Coching, about
theſe Caſtles, and what pollicie the Captaine
found to defend the Caruell from them.
Chap. 70.
               
                  IMmediatly after, was the Captaine generall
aduertiſed by eſpies that he had ſent of
theſe caſtles, and that the enimies were alſo
making in readineſſe certein fireworkes, y•
therwith they might burne y• caruells, & if
they could not burne ye ſame, y• then with
theſe caſtles, they might lay the ſaid Caruel aboord: As ſoone
as the dwellers & inhabitants of Coching heard of theſe caſtles,
they were therwith grealy afeard, leaſt yt the enimyes
would take Coching, & with that did make themſelues in a
redineſſe to flie from thence, for the which the king of Coching
was very ſad, ſuppoſing y• indéed with theſe Caſtles,
his enimies wold take his country from him. After this, certeine
of the inhabitants of Coching went to ye Captaine generall,
to aſke him whether he was able with his caruells
to defend himſelfe from theſe caſtles. Whervppon the Captaine
anſwered & aſkt of them, wherefore they demanded y•
queſtion, ſéeing y• they did well know, that from a greater
power then this, he had made them flie with broken heads,
& ſo he doubted not, but he would doe againe. With this
anſwere, ye inhabitants of Coching were fully ſatiſfied, & ſo
minded not to remoue themſelues from thence, vntill ſuch
time the battell were fought. The Captaine general for to
encourage them the more,A Caluete, and vvhat the meaning thereof is. commaunded before them all to
pitch a long ſtaffe in the ground, the which was made ſharp
at y• one end. The ſame amongſt the Malabars is called Caluete,
vpon ye which they do execute iuſtice of death: vnto the

pooreſt or vileſt people of the country: inſomuch y• if they ſay
to a Naire, Naire Caluete, they take the ſame for a greater
reproch then any other. This Caluete being pitched on this
ſort, the Captaine generall did then ſweare, to ſpit vpon the
ſame the king of Calicut, if ſo be that he did fight with
him, & ſo forthwith he commaunded in diſpraiſe of the king
of Calicut, y• all his men ſhould ſay with a lowd voice, Samurin
Caluete. At this ſight the inhabitants meruailed to
ſée ye ſtoutneſſe of y• Captaine, & ſo minded to remaine & kéep
the towne. But for all this, the Captaine Generall was inwardly
moued in ſpirit, for feare yt indéed they wold lay his
caruels a boord, & that for lacke of men. Howbeit ye better to
defend them from ye ſame, he commanded to be made a certeine
Caniſo, ye which was made wt certeine maſts of ſhips,
ioyned the one to the other, & bound with great bolts and
hoops of yron Theſe maſts wer of eight fathom of length,
& as many of breadth, & were placed from y• Caruels a good
ſtones throw. And for y• the eb nor yet the floud ſhould carry
ye ſame away, ther wer laid out ſixe great ankors, thrée
of them vpon the floud, & the other vpon the eb, y• made the
ſame the ſurer. And for that the Caruels ſhould remaine ſo
high as y• caſtles, one Peter Raf
                        •
                     l conſidering theſe deuiſes,
deuiſed alſo to encounter with the height of thoſe caſtles, to
make certeine turrets of halfe maſts, which were ſet vpright,
and made faſt a boord the caruell, in the which turrets
ſeuen or eight men might fight at pleſure in each of them.
This being done, one morning before day ther came to viſit
the Captain general the king of Coching, of whoſe cōming
the Captaine was very glad, for yt he had heard how fearfull
he was, & therfore he gaue him a good countenance, yet
for all this, the king could diſſemble no lōger, but preſently
his eies did run downe with water, & with yt he embraced
the Captaine general, & cōmanded thoſe noble men yt came
with him to do ye like, which was done with ſo ſorrowfull
a countenance, as though it were y• laſt time yt they ſhould
méet. Afterward ye king did apart himſelf with yt captaine &
ſome of our men, & as a man out of his wits, ſaid vnto him.

The King of Calycut hath a great power,The king of Cochings vvords to the Captaine generall. and we are but
few, and that without any hope that I haue to defend Coching,
or any of my people, who beſides are ready to runne
away if thou be ouercome. And ſince that I am vndone,
I requeſt thée, that thou doe prouide for thine owne ſafetie,
whilſt thou haſt time, for that afterwards, I doubt thou
ſhalt not haue the ſame: and therewith, as though he were
ſtopped in the throte, he ſpake no more.
               The Captaine generall ſhewing himſelfe to be angrye
with this ſpeach,The aunſvver that the captain generall made to the King of Coching. aunſwered him ſomewhat with cholar,
aſking him what weakneſſe or cowardneſſe he had ſéene in
him, that he ſhould will him to prouide for his ſafetie? And
further ſaid, that there or in what place ſoeuer he was, he
was moſt aſſured to defend himſelfe from the King of Calicut,
and alſo doubted not but to giue him the ouerthrow,
notwithſtanding the great power he brought. And diddeſt
not thou tell me (quod he) all theſe times paſt, that God did
fight for the Portingales, but now how doſt thou doubt of
the ſame? I haue a hope in God, that to morow thou ſhalt
ſée the King of Calycut put in that Caluete, and of this I
doe not doubt, if he doe tarry me, neither yet thou oughteſt
to haue any doubt, if thou wouldeſt thinke vpon the victories
that God hath giuen me ſo oftentimes, the King of Calycut
hauing the ſame aduantage that now he hath. This
thou oughteſt to beléeue, and not that which the Moores of
Coching do tell thée, for yt they all doe not loue vs, neither
yet the alteration of the Nayres ſhould make thée apalde,
which are afeard of euery puffe of winde. Repent thy ſelfe
therefore of that thou haſt told me, and diſpaire not, but returne
with good courage to Coching, and there alſo to comfort
and harten thy people, ſhew thy ſelfe ſtrengthened, &
ſtay thy ſubiects from going away, and let me alone with
this Paſſage, for I will giue thée a good accompt thereof.
               
               
                  The King minding not to encreaſe his cholar, did ſhew
himſelfe recomforted with his words and comfortable anſwere,
truſting that we would defend the Paſſage, according
to the valyaunt mindes he had founde in vs, and in

our Captaine generall: which he did affirme without any
doubt of the defence thereof. The Nayre, and all the people
of Coching, vpon their alteration and determination,
they made for their departing, beléeuing yet that our men
ſhould be ouerthrowen, did therevpon prouoke the Moores
to runne awaye, but yet neuertheleſſe they would not.
            
            
               ¶How the King of Calycut did giue the Battaile
vnto the Captaine generall with his caſtells, &
ow they were all ouerthrowen. cap. 71.
               
                  THe King of Coching being departed, the
Captaine generall went to his Caruell,
ſhewing himſelfe grieued greatly, to ſée the
King ſo faint hearted, the which might bée
the occaſion that Coching might be diſinhabited,
which he feared very much: and
being deſirous to ſuppe with his men, thether came Lorenſo
Moreno, with thoſe of the Factorie, with whom he was
accuſtomed to come, for (as I haue ſaid) there was neuer
any found in the battel of our men, that the enimies could
ouercome: The Supper being done, they went to reſt
themſelues till midnight, and being confeſſed and abſolued
by the Vicar, the Captaine generall ſaid vnto them.
               MAſters and my friends,The Captain generals Oration to his company▪
                   I am very merie & glad that
you doe remember the principall thing, which is your
ſoules, for that I doe well knowe, that with this remembrance
God will haue vs in his high & glorious memorie,
to giue vs the victory againſt our enimies, not onely for
the ſatiſfaction of our troubles, but alſo for the increaſing
of his holy and Catholike faith and that the King of Coching
and his people might vnderſtand, that our God is a
true God, and mightie aboue all mighties, and that hée
doeth not fayle thoſe which doe put theyr confidence and
truſt in his name. As for the King of Coching,
you did well ſée him yeſterdaye howe ſadde and heauie
                  
                  and without hope he went away 
                        〈◊〉
                      in the victory,
which God I doubt not hath promiſed vs, making ſure
account, that we were all loſt, and vtterly caſt awaye, perſwading
me withall▪ that I ſhuld in time prouide for mine
owne ſafetie. Surely I did neuer finde in him ſo much
feare, nor yet ſo great cowardneſſe, the occaſion therof was,
that they heard that the power of the king of Calicut was
much greater then it was before. And although it were ſo
great as they doe thinke, yet farre greater without al compariſon
is our God, and that haue you well ſeene in the
helps paſt that he hath ſent vs, and euen ſo now do I hope
that he will likewiſe helpe vs and ſend vs the victory.
And with this hope let vs aſſuredly truſt to ouercome the
enimyes, for he will maintaine the honour that wée haue
gotten, and from hence forth will ſo encreaſe the ſame, that
we ſhould remaine in this worlde for lightes of valiaunt
men, and for the ſame be ſo feared in the Indias, that neither
the king of Calicut nor any elſe will dare ſet vpon vs:
and the honour being gotten, we ſhall be aſſured of reſt for
the troubles we haue had.
               
               As he had ended they ſayd all, that without the victorye
they would not liue.Mē make warres to the intēt to liue in peace. And at this time which was two
houres after midnight, ſome of the Ordinaunce of the fléete
of the king of Calycut beganne to diſcharge, making theyr
way towards the Captaine Generall: and the king himſelfe
went by land, being accompanied with more then thirtie
thouſand men, with his field péeces, as his vſe was, and
with great hope ye he ſhould giue vs the ouerthrow, & with
this double pride, much more then he euer had, he came forward.
The Lord of Repelyn marched before with certeine
men that ſhould make rampyres of earth in the point of
Arr
                        ••
                     l, for a defence for our enimyes in the battell.
He brought with him great noiſes & cries, with great pleaſure
and dauncing, the which the Captaine generall didde
heare, and went verie ſecretly a lande, and placed himſelfe
in the very point where the enimies ſhuld come, the which

he did defend that the enimies ſhould not make there any
rampyers, about the which our men killed ſome of them.
This being knowne to the king of Calicut, that the Captaine
Generall came thether to méete with him, hée commaunded
his ſouldiers with a ſtout ſtomacke to ſet vppon
him and take him aliue, the better to reuenge himſelfe on
him at his pleaſure. About this there was a great ſkirmiſh
and many of the enimies were ſlaine without taking of
the Captaine Generall, neither yet could they make theyr
rampiers. As the morning came on which was the Aſcention
day, the other Fléete did appeare, y• which was not far
off, and by this, the Captaine generall was retired vnto his
boates, but it was with great trouble, becauſe of the great
multitude of the enimies which came vpon him: howbeit
he imbarked both himſelfe and his men without lacking any
of them, but there were of the enimies many ſlaine and
hurt. The point béeing now cléere & vnfurniſhed, the enimies
came and placed themſelues there, and then they began
to ſhoote off their Ordinaunce at vs, to the which wée
did aunſwere with ours, dooing them great hurt therewith,
for that all our ſhot went amongſt the enimies, where they
lay open, and our men were well fenced, therefore their ordinaunce
could doe vs no hurt.The king of Calicut being in danger ſendeth for ſuccor to ye reſt of his fleete. The king of Calicut ſéeing
this, ſent word to his Fléete that they ſhould rowe a pace,
and come to helpe and deliuer him from the daunger and
feare that our men did put him in. The Fléete being come,
it was a fearefull ſight to beholde them, for that there was
driuen before them certeine raffes, the which went alwaies
burning, with intent to ſet the Caruells on fire, and after
them an hundred and ten Paraos full of men & ordinance, &
many of them cheined together, and after them a hundred
Catures in the ſame manner, and foure ſcore Tonis de coxia
ancha, and in each of them thirtie men, beſides theyr ordinaunce,
and the eight caſtles in kéeping of theſe, the which
ſtoode hard by the point, for that the ebbe was not as yet
altogether entered. The enimies came with great clamor,
making great laromes and cries, and plaieng vpon inſtruments,

accounting vs as ouercome already, and with this,
they ſhot off ſo many péeces of Ordinance as it was wonderfull
to ſee, and with their fagots which they brought before
them burning, they drew very neere to the Canizo,
which was placed before the Caruells, and therefore they
could not come to ſet the Caruels a fire, neither any other
of all the Fléete. Wherefore, all thoſe that went before, did
ioyne with the Caniz
                        •
                     , and therewith did giue vs battaile,
& without all doubt they had cloſed with vs at this time,
if this defence had not bene. In this ſodaine fight which
was very great, the battel indured a good while, vntill ſuch
time the ebbe came on, and at this time the enimies receiued
great hurt, not onely in their Fregates that were torne
in péeces and ſunke, but alſo many of their men that were
ſlaine and hurte. The Ebbe being come, the Paraos with
their Caſtles did put off from the poynt, and to the ende
they ſhould goe the ſwifter, they were rowed with boats.
Theſe came right towards the Caruells, and in the greateſt
of them all went fortie fighting men, and in the other
of the middle ſort in each of them fine and thirtie, and in
the leſſer ſort thirtie men. All theſe were bowmen & ſhot,
and beſides that they did carrie Ordinaunce, and ſtoode all
abroad, which did ſhewe ſo terrible and monſtrous a front,
as was fearful to be ſéene, the rather being ſo great a fléet,
in compariſon of our ſmall power to defend them, we hauing
but two Caruells & two boats▪ But this was ye day
wherein God did well ſhew, the great regard he had to preſerue
vs, for that neither the ſight of ſo many men, and ſo
many ſorts of wayes whereby they had compaſſed and beſet
vs, neither yet ſuch a Fléete, that was ſo great and
mightye, with the fearefull cryes that the Enimies did
make, nor the terrible thundering of the Ordinance, could
any wayes diſcourage or make vs afeard. The greater of
the Caſtles being come hard to this defence, did then ſhoote
off all his ordinance at the Caruels, & the Captaine generall
commaunded to ſhoote at the ſame with a Saker, the
which cauſed the ſaid Caſtle to ſtand wauering, but yet did

them little harme, neither yet with another péece that they
ſhot off foorthwith, with the which Captaine generall was
ſo ſad,The praier of a diſtreſſed minde in the bitterneſſe of heart. that he lifted vp his eyes vnto heauen, ſaieng: Lord,
doe not retourne my ſinnes to my face at this time, and
this he ſaid with ſuch a loude voyce, that ſome there were
that heard the ſame. In the meane while came the other
Paraos, which did ſet themſelues right equal with the firſt,
& with the comming of theſe, the battell did increaſe more
and more very ſtoutly on all parts. Their arrowes came
ſo thicke, which made ſo great a ſhadow, that ſometimes
ther appeared neither heauen nor earth, with y• great ſmoke
of their Ordinaunce. The Captaine generall did tourne,
and commaund to ſhoote at the great Caſtle the Saker againe,
& as with y• other ſhot paſt, they had ſomwhat ſhaken
their yron works which were not very ſtrong, ſo with the
ſame ſhot they preſently brake, & after yt the yron workes
were thus broken, ſome of their beams being likewiſe caried
away, with certeine of their men ſlaine, with y• ſame our
men gaue a great cry, & the Captaine general falling down
on his knées, gaue God great thankes, & returning to ſhoot
the Saker againe, did carrie away another row of beams,
with many more ſlaine and hurt, and the Ordinaunce being
ſhotte off againe, it was all torne in péeces in a ſmall
ſpace, and ſo the enimies went with their Caſtle further of,
but the others remayned there fighting very ſtoutly. And
after this, both parts endured more trouble all the day folowing,
then in all the battells that were paſt: but in the
ende, we did ſo much hurt vnto their Caſtles, and ſunke and
rent ſo many of their Paraos in péeces, y• the enimies could
not abide the ſame, & therfore they ſhrank thence. The fight
did endure till euenſong time, & began in y• morning: of the
enimies wer many ſlain, as afterward was ſéene in y• water,
& of vs none, nor any hurt, but only bruſed with a ſhot
which went through ye Admiral, ye bullet went among many
that were there, but they receiued no harme.
               The Captaine generall ſéeing the enimies went their
waye, followed them in their Boates, and ſuch Paraos
                  
as he had, ſhooting alwayes at thoſe that were vppon the
point Ar
                        •
                     aul, with the king, and with the force of their
Ordinaunce made them runne away, leauing behinde them
ſlaine thrée hundred and thirtie men. This béeing done, he
then returned to his Caruells, where that euening came to
viſit him the Prince of Coching in the behalfe of the king,
who ſent to excuſe himſelfe that he could not come to viſit
him in his owne perſon. But he ſent him againe word, that
he wold receiue no diſcharge, vntill ſuch time he knew his
heuines was paſt, but praied him frō hence forth to beléeue
better in God, for that the daungerous daye of the Caſtles
was paſt, and he remained in the paſſage as he did before,
all ſafe, and in readineſſe to ſerue him. The ſelfe ſame daie
came to viſit him certeine noble men, of thoſe that were of
the king of Cochings ſide, with whome there was made
great triumph for this victorie: and likewiſe there went to
ſée him many Moores Merchants which brought him great
preſents, ſuppoſing to get of him thereby great friendſhip.
He receiued them very gently, praieng them to be true ſubiects
to the king of Coching, for thereby they ſhould finde
him aſſured at any time whenſoeuer he might ſtand them
in any ſtéede, wherevpon they faithfully promiſed ſo to do,
& to binde them the more, he made them very great chéere.
Alſo the next day in the morning the king of Coching came
to viſit him, who imbraced him with as great gladneſſe as
could be deuiſed, ſaieng that he did wel performe ye which
he had promiſed, in giuing the king of Calycut the ouerthrowe.
But vnto this he anſwered, that he had not performed
all his promiſe, ſince that he did not put him on the
Caluete, but he was not in fault thereof, for that the king
kept himſelfe alwayes farre from him. He declared alſo to
the king diuerſe other matters of pleaſure, which the king
anſwered in like manner, praiſing very much his valiantnes,
& that he had wel ſéene ye God did fight for vs, aſking of
him forgiueneſſe for ye diſtruſt he had in him, & how greatly
he was bound to ſuccour him, declaring alſo that the affaires
of Portingale were very great, and confeſſing lykewiſe

that he through his worthineſſe had made him king.
After this victorie the inhabitants of Coching did caſt off
the feare they had of the king of Calycut, in ſuch ſort, that
neuer from thence forth they ſtoode in anye dread of him,
neither yet made account of his habilitye.
            
            
               Of the counſell which the king of Calycut tooke
of his brother, and how hee was gaine-ſaide:
and alſo by what pollicie & meanes the king
of Calycut ſought to kill the Captaine generall.
chap. 72.
               
                  THE king remained greatly aſhamed and
very ſad, for that at the ſame time he could
not ouerthrowe the Captaine Generall,
the rather becauſe he neuer accounted any
thing more certeine, then to ouer come
him in that conflict, becauſe of the Caſtles
which he had prepared for his confuſion. And now leauing
a ſide all hope euer to haue the victorie, he deſired to haue
with vs no more warres, and therefore he called before him
into his tents, all thoſe kings and noble men that came to
helpe him, and ſayd thus vnto them.
               YOV doe well ſée how little our power profiteth vs againſt
theſe men,The king of Calicuts oration vnto his noble men. and how little our pollicies preuaileth
ſince they doe not regard vs, and would neuer giue ouer the
paſſage, notwithſtanding the greate power we had againſt
them. The like account alſo they make of vs in their feaſts,
and paſtimes when we goe againſt them, as though wee
were the fewer, and they the more, and as though the land
which they are in were theirs, & we were the Chriſtians,
whereby it appeareth, they alwayes make account of the
victorie for certeine, which either they obteine by witchcrafts,
or elſe their God doth fight for them, which cannot
bée otherwiſe, conſidering the great victories they haue had

againſt vs, and the greate hurt that we haue receiued of
them. Wherefore I ſuppoſe that God would it ſhould be ſo,
for the litle iuſtice yt is obſerued in theſe wars, as hath wel
appered in the beginning of the ſame. And if I had ben wel
aduiſed, it ſhuld not haue gone ſo farre forward, but in the
end I am in the fault, and not they, and ſince it is ſo, wée
haue therin no right cauſe, neither canne gette any thing
by our ſtrength. Let vs therfore giue it ouer, & deſire no more
to haue Coching, for that God doth fauour theſe men, ſince
wel you ſée, there is no power in the Indias that can offend
vs ſo long, we being ſo ſtrong, but theſe dogs, of whom I
am afraid, yt they will ſubdue the Indias, according to the
acts that they haue done, and the credit that they haue gotten,
eſpecially in Malabar. And that this miſhap may go no
further, I thinke it ſhoulde be conuenient to procure theyr
friendſhip, & alſo it is time to get vs away, for y• the winter
commeth on, & the riuers do increaſe, & theſe men do ouerrun
all: and this is certeine, ye if the wars indure, they will
come hether & inforce vs to depart with our loſſe & diſhonor.
Now y• firſt that he aſked councell of what was neceſſary
to be done, was his brother Nabeadarin, who being angry
with the king that he wold neuer follow his councel, &
leaue the warres, ſaide: that now he knewe to his coſt
what he had told him of vs: & ſince in time he woulde not
know it, he aſked him what it ſhuld now profit him for his
honour and credit, ſince y• then when opportunitie ſerued he
refuſed his councell, but now he willed him to do what he
ſhuld thinke good, for he could not do amiſſe. The king béeing
ſomwhat broken of his pride, (calling him brother) ſaid
that now there was no time to aunſwere him after ſuch
ſort, but to tell him his opinion what he thought beſt. The
prince anſwered y• we were venterous,The counſell that the king of Calicuts brother gaue him touching the making of peace with the captaine generall. & alwaies remained
ſo aſſured of the victory, vpon our experienced ſtrength and
good fortune, albeit our power were much leſſe, ſo ye he greatly
doubted we would none of his friendſhip. And for thée to
offer ye ſame, ſaid he to ye king, & they to refuſe it, wold be no
leſſe diſhonor vnto thée, then the often ouerthrows y• thou

haſt receiued. And ſince by thy profered friendſhip, we cannot
get ſo much as we ſhould looſe if they refuſe y• ſame, it
were beſt therefore not to procure it, but to defer it, & make
peace with the Captaine general that commeth y• next yere
from Portingale, who conſidering howe little the wars
will profit him, & not being aſſured of good ſucceſſe therein,
will be the gladder to make peace with thée, & therfore that
it may not be thought that we run awaye for feare, let vs
ſtay & not depart, vntill ſuch time it ſhuld be thought, that ye
neceſſitie of the winter did inforce vs hence, & then may we
wel talke of peace, when poſſible the Captaine general wil
willingly accept the ſame, doubting that his good fortune
may chaunge. And to prouoke & giue occaſion the rather to
haue his friendſhip, let vs giue him no more battels in the
meane time, ſince it ſerueth to no purpoſe, but to the great
loſſe and confuſion of our men.
               
               This councell of Nabeadarin was reproued by the
kings and noble men which were there then aſſembled, &
eſpecially of the Lord of Repelyn, which ſaid that the king
ought not to goe away, neither for the greatneſſe of the
winter that ſhould come, nor yet for the ioſſe of his men,
but rather to continue, giuing vs manye battailes, vntill
ſuch time he did take vs, and not onely procured the deſtruction
of vs in Coching, but alſo of thoſe that were in
Cananor and Coulan. And that immediatly it were expedient
they ſent men of credit with letters to affirme, that they
had boorded our Caruells with their Caſtles,A ſubtile deuice by meanes of a lye to haue brought our mē to deſtructiō but it toke no effect▪
                   and had alſo
ſlaine vs all, and taken our ſayd Caruells, and therefore
that they ſhould kill all thoſe that were there, as they had
promiſed. To the ſame effect therefore the king did write
immediatly and the Moores alſo, but there was no credite
giuen to the ſame, for that there was other newes ſent
before, and therefore the laſt was taken for falſe. Neuertheleſſe
for all that, by the induſtry of the Moores the which
did dwel in thoſe two towns, our men were in great danger,
and durſt not come out of theyr Factoryes, and in
Coulan there was one ſlaine, but in the other places none,

for afterward meſſengers were ſent from Calycut to the
Gentiles, that our men were aliue, and what wée had done.
For which cauſe the king of Calycut was aunſwered that
they would not kill our men, vntill ſuch time the Captaine
Generall was taken, and that he had firſt giuen him the
ouerthrowe, which béeing done, they would conclude with
him. This béeing come to the knowledge of the Lorde of
Repelyn, both he and the Moores did perſwade the king
to fight another battell with the Captaine Generall, the
which he would willingly not haue done, for that he was
wearyed in his ſpirit, but he could not withſtand them, and
therefore commaunded the ſame to bée giuen both by Sea
and lande. But in it he had lyke ſucceſſe as before, ſo that
more through the importunate deſire of the Moores then of
his owne will, he gaue in his owne perſon another battell
with his Caſtles, with many more men and veſſells then
in the other before. This battell endured longer then the
other, in which alſo the enimyes were ouercome, and receiued
farre greater loſſe then euer they did before. With
this victorye that we had gotten, the inhabitaunts of Coching
remained ſure from all their enimies, and ſo likewiſe
did the king, whom afterward came to viſite the Captaine
generall, being brought in a chaire, with farre greater eſtate
then euer he came before, ſince the firſt beginning of all the
warres. This being knowne in the campe of the enimies,
the kings and noble men that were with the king of Calicut,
tooke occaſion to ſay vnto him that he ſhoulde not conſent,
in eſpecially hauing ſuch a greate power as he hadde
there preſent,An aunſvvere vvhich ye king of Calicut made vnto certein noble mē
                     ▪
                   that the king of Coching ſhould haue him in
ſo ſmall reputation, as thereby to iudge himſelfe frée from
him, & out of his danger. To the which the king of Calicut
made anſwere, ye the king of Coching had great reſon to do
that which he had done, in eſpecially knowing his greate
power and camp, and yet perceiuing that he could not giue
him the ouerthrowe. And ſince that his euill fortune was
ſuch, he deſired them not to wiſh him to go forward in theſe
wars, for that he knewe well and was fully perſwaded,

that continuing the ſame, he ſhoulde alwayes receiue
the loſſe, and run daily into greater danger, as by the feare
thereof it was apparaunt. And therefore he requeſted them
all to let him alone by himſelfe, who ſo béeing, did imagine
againe what courſe he might beſt take to reuenge himſelfe.
               And after that he came aboord, he called for certeine of his
Nayres, in whom he had repoſed all his truſt, commanding
them to go to Coching with ſome diſſimulation, and there
to trauaile all that they could to kill the Captaine general,
and all ſuch of our men as they could méete withall. And
as the Naires are men inconſtant, and cannot kéepe counſel
longer then they are bethinking themſelues therof, therfore
immediatly their intent was knowne to the Captaine general,
who from thence forward had a better regard to himſelfe,
and vnto the reſt of his companye then he had before.
And the better to take thoſe Naires which came as Spyes
thether, he appointed thervnto two companies of y• Naires
of Coching, commaunding the one to k▪pe dilligentlye a
long the foord, and the other a long the riuer, who watched
by quarters both by day and night. Whileſt this dilligence
was vſed, the Captaine Generall had knowledge that this
ſpy was a Naire of Coching, and of the houſe or ſtocke of
the Leeros, who had attendant vppon him certeine Nayres
that were ſtraungers, which appeared to bée lyke thoſe of
Calicut.
               
               Nowe hauing certeine knowledge héereof, he ſo hande
the matter, and in ſuch order, that forthwith hée tooke
them all priſoners, and béeing brought before him, he commaunded
them to bée cruellye whipped in the preſence of
thoſe Naires of Coching, and afterwarde to bée hanged.
The inhabitauntes of Coching ſéeing this, requeſted the
Captaine Generall to giue them ſome other puniſhment
ſince that they were Nayres, and not to ſhewe them ſo
great extremitie, but notwithſtanding hée wold not graunt
vnto anye other puniſhment, for that they had deſerued
the ſame.
               
                  
Then all his Captaines ſayde vnto him,The Oration of certeine captains vnto their generall for his better aduiſe in adminiſtration of iuſtice. that firſt and
before all he ſhould call to remembraunce, the greate troubles
that the King of Coching hadde ſuſteined for the onelye
mainteining of them, and alſo howe much it woulde
grieue him to heare ſaye, that ſuch were hanged in his
Countrie without his conſent.
               Alſo it woulde giue an occaſion for ſuch noble men as
were with him, to ſaye that he is a king but for a while,
ſince that his iuriſdiction is nowe taken from him.
And foraſmuch as hetherto he had vſed him alwayes with
reuerence, they wiſhed that nowe at the ende he woulde
haue him in a greater eſtimation then euer hée hadde before.
               The Captaine Generall hauing conſidered theyr reaſons,
did allowe of theyr good councell héerein, and cauſed
thoſe Naires to be ſent for, that were gone to execution,
of the which there were two halfe dead, but thoſe
that were liuing hée ſent to the king of Coching, aduertiſing
him how that they hadde deſerued death, and alſo the
cauſe why hée hadde not commaunded them to bée hanged.
               The King hearing this, tooke the ſame in greate honour
and eſtimation, that they were ſent him, and eſpeciall
for that there were preſent ſundrye of the noble men
of his Countrie, and of other places, yea, and Moores alſo,
of the chiefeſt that dwelt in Coching, which did not
lette to ſaye vnto the king to afrunt him withall, that
our men were they that commaunded and did not obeye.
               But from hence foorthe the Captaine Generall
hadde ſuch intelligence, that the ſubtile
dealinges of the king of Calycut,
tooke very ſmall
effect againſt
him.
            
            
               
               How the king of Calicut of pure heauineſſe for the ill
ſucceſſe he had in the warres, did put himſelfe
into a Torcull, and within a ſmall time
after came foorth therof. chap. 73.
               
                  IVne béeing now ended, and the winter beginning
to increaſe, the Captaine generall
thought that it woulde be ſome cauſe that
the king of Calicut would not tarrie there
long. And therfore he was fully minded to
ſet vpon him at the remouing of his camp,
for that by experience he knew the ſmall valour of his enimies,
by ſuch victories as he had gotten in times paſt, which
did therefore animate him the more therevnto, thinking
that at ſuch a time he might doe him much harme. And being
in a readineſſe to vncheine his Maſtes, he was preſently
informed that the king of Calicut was reforming a new
his Caſtles, and preparing in a readineſſe a greater Fléete
then euer he had before, that hée might giue him therewith
once more the battaile.A falſe alarome giuē forth by ye Calicutians to terrifie the Portingals vvith all. This was but a fléeing
newes that was commaunded to be giuen out by the
king of Calycut, who did ſurmiſe that at the raiſing of
his Campe, which hée was minded to doe, and to goe
his waye, the Captaine Generall woulde ſette vppon
him.
               And therefore hée determined, that his departure ſhould
be ſo ſecretlye done, that no man ſhoulde knowe thereof
but onelye Nabeadarin. For this cauſe therefore
he gaue out, that hée woulde giue the battaile in the paſſage
of Palurte, and alſo in the Foorde both together, to
the ende the Captaine Generall might occupie himſelfe
in defending them both, and hée himſelfe the better
ſteale awaye, as hée didde: but hée gotte nothing thereby,
more then hée hadde gotten before.
               
                  
After all this, on Saterday in the Euening, which was
Saint Iohns euen, on which day they gaue out, that they
would giue the battaile, there appeared the whole army of
the enimyes as they were accuſtomed to ſhew themſelues.
The Captaine Generall hoping of theyr comming, did tarrye
there all that night, but in the morning he ſaw no likelyhood
thereof, and meruailing what that ſhoulde meane,
was informed by two Bramenes that the king of Calycut
was gone with his whole power vnto Repelyn, and that
at that preſent hée was there.
               For this newes hée was very ſorrie, but yet for all that
hée entered that preſent daye into Repelyn, where hée
fought with many of his enimyes, ſlewe and hurt a greate
number, and ſo returned to the paſſage, where he remained
yet certeine dayes to enſure Coching the better, which
was yet afeard of the King of Calycuts returning, fearing
that he would not leaue this paſſage. Howbeit the Captaine
Generall was well aſſured that he would not come
there, by reaſon hée was fallen into ſuch reproch and ſhame,
in the ſight of all men, becauſe of his great loſſes. So that
immediatly after that he had paſt the riuers of Repelyn, he
apparted himſelfe with his noble men which had accompanied
him in theſe warres, and ſaid vnto them with wéeping
eyes in this manner following.
               FOR a man that is without ſhame,the kings Oration, made to ſuch princes & noble mē as came to aide him in theſe vvarres. as I am, it is not
much to ſhedde theſe teares as I doe, the heauineſſe of
my loſſe béeing ſuch, as fetcheth the ſame from my hearte,
with the which I am ſo troubled, that ſince it is ſo, that I
cannot doe it in publike forte, I will goe into ſome place
where I may do the ſame without any body that may ſée
mée. I haue alſo another griefe which troubleth mée verye
ſore, ouer and beſides my diſhonour, which is, for
that I am not able to rewarde you for all the greate
good will and ſeruice you haue done mee in theſe warres,
the which I take for ſo greate a duetye, that if ſo be that
I might ſée my ſelfe diſcharged of the ſame, I ſhould bée

better contented, then with the getting of Coching. But
ſince it is not Gods pleaſure that I ſhoulde get the victorie
ouer it, which hath procured my diſhonour, ſo is it not
his pleaſure and will that I poſſeſſe the ſtate of a king any
longer, but rather for the amending of my ſinnes will
ende my lyfe in this Torcull,
                  A Torcull is as much as vvith vs an hermitage, or ſuch lyke pore kind of ſolitary relgious place▪
                   where I meane to continue
vntill ſuch time that God hath taken awaye this hatred,
which hée hath conceiued againſt mée. And from this time
forward you may diſpoſe of your ſelues, and do what you
ſhall thinke beſt with my countrie and ſubiectes. I doe not
offer you my perſon, forſomuch as béeing a man ſo vnfortunate
as I am, it ſhall not ſtand with your credite to require
his companye, and with this ſpeach hée ended his
talke.
               But the Princes and Noble men woulde ſomewhat
haue comforted him, and withdrawne him from this his
determination, but it could not preuaile, for that he had fully
bent himſelfe to the contrary, and ſo with certeine of his
Chaplaines he entered into this Torcull.
               Now his mother hauing knowledge that he was there,
ſhée ſent him word, that for this his ſodeine determination
ſhe remained as heauie and with as ſorrowfull a heart
as might bée.The Mothers meſſage to ye King of Calycut, being in the Torcull. Informing him moreouer, that through this
ſodeine chaunce, there hath riſen in Calycut a great alteration,
for that from thence are gone and now are ready to go
many & ſundrie merchants, and alſo that the citie is become
wonderfully vnprouided of victualls, with the greate feare
the inhabitants are in of the Chriſtians: which is the occaſion
ther are no victualls brought thether. But no perſwaſion
ſhe ſayd,Wher credit is impaired, it is better to lurke then to runne abroad vvith diſhonour. could withdrawe him from theſe wars with
the Chriſtians, which from the beginning of the ſame was
a great griefe vnto her: willing him alſo that in no caſe he
ſhoulde returne vnto Calycut, vntill he might doe the ſame
with his credit, which was cleane loſt alreadie. And therefore
ſhée counſailed him a while to forbeare, vntill ſuch
time he did recouer it againe, and that with victorie, yea, &
rather to looſe all then to returne without it.

With this meſſage the Kings heauineſſe increaſed greatlye,
and he ſent immediatelye for his Brother, to whome
being come, he gaue him charge of the gouernment of his
kingdome. But after that he came out of the foreſaid Torcull,
it was reſtored vnto him againe.
            
            
               ¶How there came ſundry Kings & Princes of the
Countrey to demaund peace of the Captaine
generall: & alſo how there came vnto Coching
many Moores of Calycut, to inhabite there.
Chap. 74.
               
                  ALL theſe Kings and Noble men,
which came to ſerue ye king of Calicut
(after that he had placed himſelfe
in the Torcul) remained a few
dayes in Repelyn, tarrieng to ſée
whether he did repent himſelfe of
that which he had done, or not: and
perceiuing ye contrary, each of them
repaired toward their Countreyes, whereof the moſt part
of them laye there along the water ſide. And forſomuch as
the Winter began to increaſe, and they fearing leaſt the
Captaine generall would ouercome them all, hauing now
loſt the hope they had to defend themſelues now as before
time. Therefore they minded to procure as much as they
could,the goodnes of the King of Cochings nature noted in being a meane to procure▪
                   to be friends and in peace with the Captaine generall.
For the which intent as Mediatour for the ſame purpoſe,
they ſent to the King of Coching, whom for that his
condition and nature was very good; & without calling to
remembraunce the iniuries that were paſt, which they had
done vnto him, did vndertake to do the ſame. Sending them
immediatly a ſafeconduct for their ſafe comming vnto Coching,
from whence he went in their company to viſit the
Captaine generall, whom at their méeting, he earneſtly requeſted

to receiue them as his friendes,peace for his enimies. who aunſwered,
that for his ſake he would ſo doe. Diuers other Princes
alſo there were, that coulde not come, but yet notwithſtanding
they ſent vnto him their Embaſſadours to conclude
this peace likewiſe. Alſo ſundrye Moores of Calycut that
were great Merchants, to the ende they might quietly vſe
their trade, forſooke Calycut, & came to dwell at Coching,
with the conſent of the Captaine generall. Others there
were that went to Cananor and Coulan, ſo that the great
Trade that was before in Calycut began ſodainly to fall.
And for that the Moores of Calycut began in this ſorte to
inhabite in Coching, therefore the Captaine generall wold
not leaue this paſſage, as alſo for that there came manye &
ſundry times Paraos from Calycut into the riuers to kéep
the ſame, by Nabeadarins commaundement. Howbeit the
Captaine generall met with them and fought with them,
and hurt many of his enimies. Moreouer, he oftentimes entered
into the Lord of Repelyns Countrey to take Cattell
for his prouiſion, & fought with many of his enimies, vpon
whom he made great ſlaughter. One daye by chaunce our
men met with certaine Tones of the enimies, the which
were in a certaine ſtanding water, and carried them away
into the riuers, and made with the enimies a valyant and

went in the yeare of our Lorde, a 1504. and
what more paſt or euer he came to Anſadina.
cap. 75.
               
                  
                  IN the yeare of our Lorde. 1504. the king of
Portingale hauing certeine knowledge,1504. that
the king of Calycut continued as yet in
the warres,The fifte voiage to the Indias made by ye Portingales▪
                   did therfore ſend to ſuccour our
men with a Fléete of twelue great ſhippes,
and appointed for Generall of the ſame, a
Gentleman called Lope Suares de Meneſis, who in the
time of king Don Iohn the ſecond, had bene Captaine in
the Mina. The Captaines of the Fléet were theſe following.
               
                  Pedro de Mendoſa, Lionel Cotinuo, Triſtim de la Silua,
Lope Mendus, de Vaſcon Cele, Lope de Abreo, Philipe
de Caſtro, Alonſo Lopes de Caſtro, Alonſo Lopes de
la Cocts, Pero Alonſo, de Aguylar, Vaſco de la Siluero,
Vaſco Caruallo, Pedro Dynes de Sutunell. All theſe were
Gentlemen borne, and ſome were made Gentlemen by
ſeruice. Theſe alſo carryed with them many valiant ſouldiers,
who being imbarked, and the Captaine Generall diſpatched,
did depart from Liſhborne the .xxii. of Aprill in the
ſelfe ſame yeare, and continuing theyr voiage on the ſecond
day of May, they found themſelues right in their courſe to
Cape Verde.
                  The Captain generals oration vvhith he made to his captaines, maſters and Pilots. Then y• Captaine generall hauing héere all y•
Fléete together, cauſed his Captaines, Maiſters, and Pilots,
to aſſemble themſelues, vnto whome he ſpake in ſence
following. Willing them to call to remembraunce howe
lately they had departed from Portingale, for which cauſe
it was requiſite that they were circumſpect and diligent, and
not to fall into ſuch diſorders and extremities as hetherto
they haue done, for not looking euery man vnto his charge,
and not to ſuffer one ſhip leye the other a boorde, as they
haue done alreadie, whereby they ranne all into greate
daunger. Alſo there were others he ſaid, that had no regard
to kéepe theyr right courſe, but vnaduiſedly there were ſome
that would go before, and others come after, and others by
the winde, by meanes of which diſorder they might haue

caſt away themſelues. And the better to auoid theſe daungers,
and to kéepe the Fléete in good order, he did ſet down
certaine rules in writing by his Scriuenor, and firmed
therevnto his name, with the names of the other Captaines,
which they ſhould obſerue and kéepe.
               Inprimis,Orders that vvere giuen to euery captain, Maſter and Pilot, to keepe the ſame in their voyage. That all the Fléete, as ſoone as it is night,
ſhall follow his courſe, remaining alwayes a ſterne the Generall:
and that no ſhip ſhall carry other light, then onely
that which is in the Bytoke, and within the Captaines
cabin. Alſo, that the Maſters and Pilots kéep their watch,
and that they haue a good regard, that one ſhip doe not lay
the other a boord, and that they do all aunſwere, when the
Admirall doth make any ſigne.
               Item, That as ſoone as it is day, they doe come and ſalute
their Generall, and that in the night they doe not go
before him.The penalty laid vppon the breach of theſe cō
                     maundements. He that doeth not obſerue theſe commaundements,
ſhall paye ten Crownes, and be kept in priſon, vntill
they arriue there, and that without wages. And for
that there was ſome Maſters and Pilots very neglygent,
by whoſe default one ſhip did lay the other a boord, he commaunded
to remoue them from one ſhip to another: and
by this diligence that was thus vſed, euery man had a regard
therevnto, and the Fléete went in good order, & neuer
after ranne in any daunger. Thus going on their courſe in
the month of Iune, and iudging themſelues ouer againſt
the Cape Buena ſpuransa, there fell vpon them a meruailous
great ſtorme of winde, with the which all the Fléete
ranne two dayes and two nights without ſayles, ſo yt they
were in great daunger to haue bene all caſt away, the wether
being ſo darke and cloſe, that it ſéemed rather night,
then day.
               Theſe two dayes béeing paſt, they ſaw certaine ſignes
of lande, the which as it did appeare, could not bée farre
off, and for that cauſe was the weather ſo cloſe. After that
they had diſcryed ye ſame, & were come néere thervnto, then
theſe ſignes appeared the greater. And therefore the Captaine
generall commaunded, that out of his ſhippe there

ſhould be ſhot two péeces of Ordinaunce, that the others
might after the ſame manner aunſwere with the like, and
the better kéepe companie the one with the other. This
ſtorme being paſt, they founde miſſing the ſhip of Lope
Mendez. And the Captaine generall ſéeing that he hadde
loſt the ſight thereof did not let to goe forwarde on his
courſe.
               And ſo, within certaine dayes through the neglygence
of the Officers, one ſhippe layde the other a boorde, and
gaue therewith ſo great a blow vpon the how of ye other,
that with the ſame there was opened ſo great a hole,A great leake giuē vnto one of ye ſhips through negligēce of the ſailers▪
                   that
they might ſée through the ſhippe verye well, by the which
hole there entered ſuch aboundaunce of water vppon a ſodayne,
that ſhe was almoſt ſunke. The Captaine generall
bare with the ſame ſhippe immediately, and came ſo
néere them that they might well heare him, and the great
comforte he gaue them, willyng them not to bée a fearde,
but to goe forwarde in ſtopping the leake, without feare
to be loſt, for that he was there to ſuccour them with his
men, which he did ſende in his Boats not fearing the
Seas, that went ſo high, nor the daunger that they were
in.
               And for all that the Mariners of the ſhip did ſo work,
that or euer it was night the leake was halfe ſtopped: yet
that they might end y• reſt that remayned to doe, the Captaine
generall commaunded to be made a ſign by the ſame
ſhippe, that the other Captaynes might come and ſuccour
him, if there were any ſuch néede. The wether being ye next
daye ſomewhat calme,The leak ſtopped, and the daunger thereof paſt, they ſayle forvvard▪
                   the leake was wholly ended, the
which was ſtopped with certaine hides nayled therevnto,
and pitched vpon.
               This daunger béeing paſt, without anye other miſchaunce,
woorth the writing, they arriued at Monſanbique
on Saynt Iames daye, where the Gouernour receiued
him verye well, and ſent him great refreſhing of
freſh victualls, and the Letter that Pedro de Tayde had

lefte there for him before hée dyed, as I haue ſayd before.
               Who vnderſtanding by the ſame, of the warres that
the King of Calycut had begunne agaynſt our men, didde
as ſoone as the ſhippe was rigged, and made in a readineſſe,
which they had brought a grounde for the ſame purpoſe,
he departed towarde Mylynde, béeing the firſt of
Auguſt. And immediatelye after his arriuall there, the
King ſent to viſite him by one of his principall Moores,Certaine Portingales ſent vnto the Captain generall for a preſent.
by whome hée ſent for a Preſent ſixtéene of our men, the
which did eſcape out of the ſhip that Pedro de Tayde was
Captaine of.
               Within two dayes after this, hée departed toward the
Indias, and ſo came to Anſadina, where hée founde two
Gentlemen, the one called Antonyo de Saldanua, and
the other Ruy Lorenso, which were Captaines of two
ſhippes, and were in groat feare, ſuppoſing that our Fléet
had bene of the Rumes. Then Antonyo de Saldanua, informed
largelye the Captaine generall how he departed the
laſt yeare from Portingale for Vice admirall, with Ruy
Lorenso, being giuen him in commiſſion to go & diſcouer
the red Sea with the Countreyes adiacent. And how that
in doublyng the Cape, they were verye ſorelye troubled
with a ſtorme, which was the onelye cauſe of the ſeparating
the one of them from the companye of the other. But
Ruy Lorenso as he kept his courſe after their ſeperation,
met by chaunce in the way to Sofala, with a certaine ſhip
of the Moores being laden with much golde, the which hée
tooke: & afterward that he had taken the ſpoyle of the ſame,
hée lefte the Hull in kéeping at Mylynde. Antonyo de
Saldanua went to Quardafum, where he tooke many great
and excéeding rich prices, without entering at all into the
Straights: and from thence he went into the Indias.
               
               And for that he came not to Anſadina before it was the
Winter, he was therefore driuen to tarry there with Ruy
Lorenso, who hauing paſſed many dangers, came afterward

thether, where hée paſt great troubles, for lacke of victualls.
            
            
               ¶Howe the Captaine generall came to Cananor,
and ſpake with the King: and how the Gouernour
of Calycut, woulde haue made peace with
him, howbeit he woulde not conſent therevnto.
Chap. 76.
               
                  THe Captaine generall béeing héere, came
thether vnto him Lope Mendez de Vaſcon
celis, who had loſt the companye of
his Generall, with the foule wether paſt.
And immediately after that he was come,
the Captaine generall made him preſt, for
his departure towarde Cananor, where he arriued the firſt
daye of September. There the Factor enformed him of
the warres of Calycut, and how that he with his other
fellowes that remained in Cananor, had ſéene themſelues
oftentimes in daunger of death.
               The next daye after his comming thether,The Captain generall goeth a land to viſite the king of Cananor. he woulde
néedes goe a lande to viſite the King of Cananor. All the
Captaines of the Fléete he carried in his company to attende
vppon him with theyr Boates, the which were ſet
foorth with theyr Flagges and Ordinaunce to the vttermoſt,
and the men apparayled in the beſt apparayle that
they had. And as for the Boate in the which the Captayne
generall went, it was couered ouer and beſet with
Carpettes in the beſt manner,The ſtate which the Captaine generall kept at his going to viſite ye king of Cananor. vppon the which ſtoode
his Chayre, the which was made of vnſhorne Crimſon
Veluet, and at his féete there were ſet two very faire
Cuſhions of the ſame. His Dublet was alſo made of
Satten, beeing of ſundrye coulours, the which was
wrought Diamond wiſe.
               And moreouer, his hoſe were made after the ſame
ſorte, and his Shooes were lykewiſe made of blacke

Veluet, which were all beſet with Aglets of golde, and his
Cap couered ouer with Buttons ſutable to the ſame: his
night gowne was made of blacke Veluet, after the French
vſe laced about, with laſe of golde, his Dagger and Rapyer
which his page held, were hafted with pure golde, and his
cheine came thrée times about his necke, the links wherof
were all enameled, and at the ſame he hadde hanging his
Whiſtle of golde of the lyke worke. There went before
him his two Lackyes, appareled as himſelf, and ſixe trumpetters
with their Flagges of ſilke. He had alſo with him
certeine wind inſtruments, vpon the which they went plaieng,
which were carryed in a little Boate hard by him, and
in the ſame was carried alſo a preſent for the king of Cananor,
which the king of Portingale ſent vnto him.The preſēt vvhich ye king of Portingal ſent to the king of Cananor.
This preſent was ſixe beds of fine holand, with two great
pillowes and pillowbéers to the ſame, all wrought with
gold. Two Couertors or Carpets of Crimſin Veluet vnſhorne,
which on the vttermoſt ſide were all quilted ouer,
and had vpon the ſame thrée gards of cloth of golde, which
in the middeſt was a ſpanne in breadth, and in the other places
of thrée fingers. The bedſtéede was all guilted ouer, the
which had Curteines of Crimoſin Satten, with Fringe
made of golde thréed. As ſoone as the Captaine Generall did
put of from his ſhippes, all the Fléete began to ſhoote off.
Afterwards the Trumpettes did ſound, and the Drums
play. After this was ended, then the Organs went, and neuer
ceaſed, till they came to the water ſide, where ther were
great multitudes of Moores and Gentiles, which came thether
onely to ſée the Captaine Generall. Who as ſoone as
he had diſimbarked himſelfe,The king of Cananors brauery and ſtate at his meting vvith the captaine generall▪
                   entered into a certeine houſe,
the which the king had cauſed to be made for the ſame purpoſe
hard by the water ſide, in the which the bedſtead with
the whole furniture apperteining was ſet vp, and hard by
the ſame there was a place appointed for y• captain generall
to ſit down on. When the king of Cananor came, he brought
before him thrée Elephants armed, as though they ſhoulde
fight, and after them there came a ſquadron of thrée thouſand

Naires, with their weapons, which was ſwoordes, targets,
and ſpeares. Alſo there came another ſquadron of two thouſand
bowe men. Laſt of all came the king himſelfe ſitting
in a chaire, the which was verie rich. When he was come
to this Sarame, the ordinance of all the Fléet was ſhot off.
The Captaine Generall thereby perceiuing the king to bée
at hande, went forth as farre as the doore to receiue him.
And after that they had imbraced each other, he preſented
him with the bed, vnto the which the king did go immediatly,
and lay downe vpon the ſame. The Captaine Generall
ſéeing that, ſate downe in his place appointed, and there
they conferred together for the ſpace of two houres. In the
meane while a graye hounde of the Captaine Generalls
would haue ſet vpon one of the Elephants, and becauſe hée
was holden, he therefore barked and plunged in ſuch ſort,
that there was none that could heare, by reaſon of the noiſe
they made, neither yet there was anye able to holde him,
which was the occaſion the king and the Captaine generall
were ſo little time together. After this méeting, there
came vnto the Captaine Generall a Moore from Calycut,
with whom there was alſo in companie a Portingale boy,
which brought a letter from ſuch of our men as remained
then captiues, from the time of Pedro Aluares Cabrals being
there, who told him by word of mouth, that the king of
Calycut was ſo broken in minde with the warres that hée
had with Edwarte Pacheco, that with pure heauineſſe hée
put himſelfe into a Torcull, ſequeſtring himſelfe from all
the world.
               And that there were many Moores Merchaunts ſo earneſtly
bent to followe theyr trade,The Mores for ſake Calicut, & goe els vvhere to dvvell▪
                   that they haue left Calicut,
and are gone to dwell in other places, by reaſon wherof,
there is in Calycut greate neceſſitie of victualls.
And therefore that the King of Calycut, the Prince, the
Aldermen, and all the dwellers of Calicut are deſirous
to make peace, and are determined to ſend vnto him about
the ſame. And gaue our men lycenſe to write thereof to
the Captaine Generall, the which they ſo did, not onely about

their requeſt, but alſo to deſire him to releaſe them out
of captiuitie.
               The Captaine Generall ſéeing and peruſing this Letter,
woulde haue aunſwered the ſame, but the Boy would
not conſent therevnto, ſaieng that of force he muſt néedes
returne with the Moore, for that they gaue him no further
lycenſe, but to bring this Letter, vppon condition that if
hée did not retourne, they woulde cutte off the heades of
all thoſe his fellowes that remayned for Captiues in Calycut.
Wherefore the Captaine Generall ſent them anſwere
by worde of mouth, that as touching his going to
Coching, it would be ſhortlye, where hée woulde come to
an Ankor as néere as hée coulde to Calycut, paſſing by the
ſame: and then they might take an occaſion to come theyr
waye towarde the Fléete, either ſwimming or in
Boates.
               This theyr going without yrons about the Citie,He vvold haue thē to eſcape frō their keepers, & come ſvvimming vnto him▪
                   was
the occaſion that the Captaine Generall gaue them this
councell, although hée knewe that they were kepte with a
gard of Naires, and alſo that they ſlept in the kings houſe.
After all this, he departed towarde Calycut, whether
hée came on Saterdaye, the ſeauenth of September, and
as ſoone as hée came to an Ankor, there repayred vnto
him the Boye, which brought him ye letter to Cananor, and
with him came a Moore Seruaunt to Coſebyquin, who
brought the Captaine Generall a preſent from ye Gouernours
of the citie of Calicut, on whoſe behalfe they ſayd,
that if ſo bée hée woulde ſend vnto Coſebyquin a ſafe
conducte, that then hée would come and ſpeake with him, and
trade for a peace.
               Wherevnto he aunſwered, that he woulde not
accepte theyr preſent, nor anye other thing, vntill
ſuch time the peace was concluded vpon: and as for
Coſebyquin, he might come vnto him without anye feare,
as a ſeruaunt of the king of Portingales. Alſo priuelye hée
ſent our men word that they ſhould indeuour as much as
they could to runne away.

This aunſwere being knowne to the gouernours, they ſent
immediatly Coſebyquin with two captiue Portingales to
the Captaine Generall, beléeuing moſt certeinlye, that by
this meanes they ſhuld prouoke vs to make the peace, which
they ſent to demaunde by the foreſaide Coſebyquin.
Praieng him alſo to tarrie thrée or foure dayes,Two tvvo Italian rū
                     agates iuſtly required by the Captaine generall to be deliuered. which they
ſuppoſed woulde be the longeſt time that the king woulde
tarry, for that they had ſent to call him, and knowing verie
well, that he would doe all that they would require him.
But he gaue them for ful anſwere, that vntil ſuch time they
deliuered vnto him the two Italian runagates that wer in
Calicut, he would not agrée to any thing, which béeing deliuered,
he would then doe what he thought good, but he ſent
them word nothing of y• captiues, for that he thought that
at anie time they might runne their waye. But as ſoone
as the Italians had knowledge,A craftye deuiſe of the Italians to haue the captiues cloſelye kept for the aſſurance of thēſelues. that the Captaine generall
did demaund them, they then ſurmiſed that if ſo be, the captiues
went not with yrons, they would runne awaye, and
ſo gaue notice therof vnto the gouernours of the Citie, how
that the Captaine Generall, if yt he might haue them wold
make peace, yea, and with ſuch conditions as the king himſelfe
would require, for that they were men of a good eſtimation,
ſo that the Captaine Generall would not forgo them
for any price.
               The Aldermen giuing credite vnto this, waxed ſomewhat
colde in ſpeaking any further of peace, but kept the
Captiues from thence forth, in ſuch ſort that they coulde
not runne away. And ſo they remained vntill the comming
of the Vizeroye Don Franciſco de Almeda, & in the meane
time ſome there were that did run awaye, and others that
died of great infirmities.

generall made in Calycut, and how he came
vnto Coching. chap. 77.
               
                  
                  THE Captaine Generall perceiuing that
the gouernours did conclude nothing, and
themſelues were without hope to haue the
captiues, he bent himſelfe determinatly to
reuenge himſelfe with ſhooting off his ordinaunce
both night and day at the Citie,
during the which time, he ſpoiled the ſame wonderfully, and
ouerthrew the kings houſe and part of their Pagodes, with
many other of their houſes. He ſlew alſo ſundry men that
came to the water ſide, wherevnto he laye ſomewhat néere
with ſeuen of his ſmall ſhips. Moreouer he had lieng a long
the ſhore all their boats, in the which were both men and
ordinance. This being done, he departed toward Coching,
wher he ariued on Saterday being the xiii. day of September.
All this day he kept himſelfe a boord, and thether came
our men to viſit him. On the next day, he diſimbarked himſelfe
hard by the caſtle in like order as he did at Cananor,
where the king of Coching was tarrieng for him, and there
receiued him with great pleaſure. And after that he had imbraced
him, they went hand in hand to the hall, in the which
there was a ſeate of eſtate,Embaſſadors are to keepe theyr eſtates for the honor of theyr Princes that ſende them. whervpon was ſet a chaire. And
for that the king did ſit lowe according to his order, ye Captaine
generall commaunded to place the chaire ſomewhat
further off from the kings ſeate, in the which he ſat downe
alſo. But all thoſe that were preſent were greatly offended
with him, for that he did not ſit vpon his chaire of eſtate by
the king, to whome he deliuered a Letter from the king of
Portingale, in the which were rendered vnto him greate
thankes, for the fauour he had ſhewed vnto his ſubiectes,
with many other gratulations. Vnto the which the king
aunſwered, that for all ſuch matters he was fully ſatiſfied
with the good ſeruice that Edwarte Pacheco had done vnto
him.
               The next daye after, the Captaine Generall ſent him a
great ſum of money, the which the king of Portingale did
beſtowe vpon him, for that he knew he was but poore.
               
                  
After all this, he commaunded Pedro de Mendoſa, and
Vaſco Caruallo to goe with theyr ſhips to kéepe the coaſt
of Calycut, that they might take all ſuch ſhips of ye Moores
as were laden with Spices: and alſo he ſent Alonſo Lopes
de la Cocta, and Peralonſo de Aguylar, and Lyonel
Cotinuo, and Ruy de Abren, to goe and receiue in theyr
lading at Coulan, for that he knew ther was ſpice in abundaunce.
               Moreouer he commaunded Triſtim de la Silua, to goe
to Grangalor, betwéene the riuers, with foure boates armed,They met vvith ſpices better cheap, & nerer hād then at Grāgalor.
of purpoſe to fight there with certeine Paraos of Calycut,
the which were there armed. So Triſtim de la Silua
ſhot at ſome of them, and alſo at certeine Nayres, the
which iſſued out from certeine pointes of the lande, and ſo
without comming to Grangalor, he tooke a ſhip laden with
Pepper, with the which he returned to Coching, where hée
did lade with the other Captaines, which was done very
quietly: and there was ſuch great ſtore of ſpices, that there
was none then néeded.
            
            
               How Edwarte Pacheco departed from Coulan vnto
Coching: and how the Captaine Generall
did ſet vppon Grangalor, and what he did
there. Chap. 78.
               
                  
                     EDwarte Pacheco béeing come from the
coaſt of Coulan, as ſoone as he had ſight of
the Captaines, the which the Captaine generall
had ſent, and for that he ſhuld haue
no more to doe after his arriuall at Coching,
ſince there was come another Captaine
Generall, did depart toward Coching the xxii. of October,
and kéeping his courſe, had ſight of a ſhip a farre off
in the Sea, toward the which he made all that day, & part
of the night, and this ſhip was driuen into Coulan▪
                   where

hauing talke with the ſame, he did vnderſtand that he was
one of the confederates the which came from Coromandil.
And immediatlye after were ſéene other thrée ſhippes of
Calycut, towarde the which he made his courſe, and kepte
a long the coaſt with the winde of the ſhoare. In the morning
he went into the Sea, and there he ſawe a Saile▪ the
which fled away from him in ſuch ſort, yt til it was toward
the euening he could not ouertake the ſame, but hard to the
lande,A ſhip of Calicut taken & caried away▪
                   with the which he fought a good while, for that it had
many men that did defend themſelues, but at the ende hée
made them amaine. The ſhippe béeing yéelded, our men
did enter the ſame by Edwarte Pachecos commaundement,
and there were brought a lande certeine of theyr
men, the reſt he commaunded to be kept priſoners and in
yrons, a boord his ſhip.
               And hauing knowledge that this was one of the thrée
of Calicut, the which he went to ſéeke out, hée put in the
ſame two of our men to kéepe and carrye it with him.
When hée was come right ouer againſt Comorin, there
fell vppon him on a ſodeine ſuch a hurling Winde, that
thereby hée was brought in great hazard to be caſt away.
               This béeing paſt, came to an Ankor within a league
of the ſhore, and there remained all that night, in the which
there ranne away well néere thirtie Moores, of the which
were twelue taken againe with his Boate. After this, hée
went vp and downe, wauering in the winde, tarryeng for
the reſt of the ſhippes, and ſéeing that they came not, nor
yet heard no more newes of them, he carryed the foreſayde
ſhippe with him to Coulan. After that hée had delyuered
the ſhip to the Factor, with all ſuch merchandiſe as he had,
the which wer many and rich, he departed toward Coching,
where after his comming the ſhips of the Fléete went to
lading. And likewiſe the others béeing come that were a lading
in other places, then the Captaine generall did enter in
councell, whether that they thought good that he ſhould ſet
vpon Grangalor or not, foraſmuch as it held on the king of
Calycuts ſide, and was enimie to the king of Coching.
                  
And now alſo the king of Calicut was come forth of the
Torcull to Calycut,
                  The king of Calicut is novve come forth of ye Torcul & taketh ye gouernement vppon him. and had in the riuers his Captaine generall
with foure ſcore Paraos, and fiftie ſhippes, and by
lande had appointed Nabeadarin with a greate number of
men.
               And foraſmuch as it was ſpread abroade, that the Captaine
Generall did depart towarde Portingale, the king of
Calycut was minded to returne and renewe the warres.
Now the Captaine generall béeing determined and aduiſed
by all the Captaines to ſet vppon Grangalor, he departed
one night with xv. boates, the which were armed with paueyſes,
and with fiue and twentie Paraos from Coching,
repleniſhed with Ordinaunce. Alſo with theſe there went
a Caruell, ſo that in the whole there were welnigh a thouſande
of our men, with whom there went alſo as manye
Nayres of Coching. In the morning before it was daye,
hée came to Palypuerto, for hée durſt venture no further,
for that the Boates went verye heauie laden with theyr
furniture, by reaſon wherof they could not paſſe the ſhoells
that were there.
               At this place there came againſt him the Prince with
eight hundred Nayres, and after this ſort, ſome there were
of them that went by lande, and ſome by water. Thus
they departed toward Grangalor, where the king of Calycuts
Captaine generall was, in two new ſhips, the which
were cheined together full of Ordinaunce and men, and the
moſt of them bowe men. And a ſtearne theſe ſhippes,
and on both their ſides were theſe Paraos with many men
alſo.
               The Captaine Generall of the enimies had in his company
two of his ſonnes, which wer accounted for to be very
valyaunt Gentlemen. Our Fléete béeing come, the Ordinaunce
beganne to goe off on both partes. Triſtim de la
Silua, Alonſo de la cocta, Vaſco caruallo, Peralonſo de Aguylar,
and Antonio de S
                        ••
                     dania, which went in the
Vangarde▪ didde cloſe with the two ſhips, with the which
they fought a while.
               
                  
Theſe ſhips being boorded,The Captaine generall of the enimies and his tvvo ſons ſlaine. were immediately yéelded, béeing
firſt of all ſlaine, the Captaine generall and both his
ſonnes, the which fought very valyantlye, and alſo manye
others, for that in this place was all the force of the Battaile.
And as touching the Paraos that the other Captains
did ſet vpon, there was but little to doe, forſomuch that as
ſoone as they ſaw their ſhips boorded they fled their waye.
Wherevpon commaundement was giuen by the Captain
generall, that all our men ſhould diſimbarke themſelues, of
whom the firſt fiue Captains were they that gaue the firſt
onſet vpon Nambeadarin, who offered to reſiſt, with certaine
Nayres which he had in his retinue: with whome
our men did fight with ſo valyant a minde, that they made
theyr enimies to runne awaye. Then our men following
the chaſe did ſet fire to certeine houſes, beſide all y• Towne
which was diſpoiled both by the Moores and Gentiles, the
which did well know, that our men would come vpon thē,
as alſo did Nambeadarin and his men, which fled awaye
along the water ſide. Edwarte Pacheco, and the Factour
Diego Hernando Correa, with the other Captaines didde
diſimbarke themſelues in another place, who immediately
began to ſet a fire the Citie. The Captaine generall in the
meane while remained along the water ſide to keepe his
men from ſcattering. Then the Chriſtians that dwelt in
this Citie, and that were hidden amongſt the houſes, when
they ſaw the Towne all in a fire, came out from where
they were hidden, crieng with a loude voyce, and requeſting
them not to kill them for that they were Chriſtians.
And ſome of them ther wer, y• ſent preſently to the Captaine
generall, to pray him that for Gods ſake hée woulde
commaund the fire to be quenched, for that they ſhoulde els
burne certaine Churches of our Ladie and of the Apoſtles
which were in the Citie, as alſo their poore houſes, y• which
were mingled with the houſes of the Gentiles and Moores.The fire commanded to be quenched for ye pore chriſtians takes that dvvelt there▪
                  
Then for their ſakes, the Generall commaunded the fire
immediately to be quenched, although that many of theyr
houſes were burnt, which for that they were made of timber,

did burne quickly. The fire being quenched, our men
fel to ranſaking of the houſes of the Moores, among whom
there were many which before time had dwelt in Calicut.
Moreouer, the two ſhippes with their Paraos that were in
the water were likewiſe burnt, beſides other thrée yt were
a land. This conflict yet continuing, there came thether the
Prince of Coching, who told the Captaine Generall, that
Nambeadaryn was not far off with his power, who was
determined to returne to the Citie, after that he was departed.
Then the Captaines procured licenſe of the Captaine
Generall that he would ſuffer them to goe ſéeke him
out, & ſo they did. But as ſoone as the enimies had ſight of
them, they ran their way as faſt as they could. The Captaine
generall ſéeing this, did returne, & wold haue ſet vpon
another Towne the which was not farre off, but for that
the Prince of Coching requeſted him to the contrary,After a valiant exploit, the Captaine Generall maketh knights in recōpence of theyr vertue. for
that the one halfe of the ſame was his, and that it was vnpoſſible
to deſtroy the one halfe without the other: and alſo
for that the King of Calycuts ſubiects were ready to ſubmit
themſelues vnto him, praying him to defend them.
Then the Captaine generall entered into the Citie, & did
ther make certain Knights, and afterward returned to the
Forte, to the which the King of Coching came to viſit
him.
            
            
               ¶How the King of Tanor ſent for ſuccour to the
Captaine generall; which he ſent him. Cap. 79.
               
                  AFter two or thrée daies paſt that the Captaine
generall was in the Caſtle, there
came thether vnto him an Embaſſadour
from ye King of Tanor, who is next neighbour
to the King of Calicut, who ſpake
vnto him in this order, on y• king his maſters
behalfe,An embaſſador ſent to the captain generall from the king of Tanor, vvho made the Oration folovving. That whereas, héerto he had bene a friend
to the King of Calicut, and did alwaies aid him in all ſuch
wars as he had made againſt Edwarte Pacheco, now ſince

he is come out of the Torcull, preſuming on his great power,
and hauing encreaſed or rather doubled his pride, doth
in recompence of his good ſeruice, make warres vpon him.
And therefore hauing knowledge that the King of Calicut
was minded to ſet forwarde and to ſuccour the Citie of
Grangalor, and that his Captaine generall was marching
toward the ſame, he did aſſemble 4000. Nayres, which he
placed in certaine ſtraights, by the which ye king of Calicut
ſhuld paſſe, & at his comming did ſet vpon his whole campe
& ouerthrew the ſame, with the death of 2000. of his men,
which was the cauſe yt he came not to ſuccour the citie of
Grangalor, but with this loſſe returned to Calicut. Wherefore
hauing done this exployt, he remaineth in feare, leaſt
he wil come and ſet vpon him. And therfore his requeſt is,
that the Captaine generall will ſuccour him, ſince moſt hū
                     bly
he doth demaund ye ſame: which if he will doe, he will
promiſe him to be true ſubiect to ye king of Portingale. To
this Embaſſage ye General aunſwered, yt he was wel content
to accept him for ye kings ſubiect, & to ſend Pedro Raphael
with his Caruell, in ye which were an 100. men, the
moſt whereof were Croſſebowmen, & ſhot. It was a great
chance, yt the ſame daye our men came to Tanor, thether
came alſo ye king of Calicut by land with his whole camp,
& gaue to ye king of Tanor battell,The king of Calycuts vvhol povver ouerthrovven at Tanor, by ye king therof, & the Portingales▪
                   in which through ye valor
of our men he was ouerthrowen, & many of his ſlaine.
And for this ſuccor yt the Generall ſent thether, the king of
Tanor remained ſubiect to y• king of Portingale. With this
ouerthrow ye king of Calicut continued in great feare, & in
leſſe credit with ye Moores, then he had with ye victories that
Edwarte Pacheco had gottē againſt him, becauſe thoſe wars
wer made with ſtrangers, but this with ye king of Tanor,
who is his neighbor. Which thing was ye cauſe, yr all ſuch
Moores, as dwelt in Calicut & Grangalor conceiued now ſo
great a miſliking to trade toward Meca, yt they determined
to return to their coūtries: & for this cauſe, they laded xvii.
great ſhips in Pandarane, fortifieng them to defend thēſelues
from our men ye better, & to offend thē, if they ſhuld come.

Alſo there were many Paraos and Tones, lykewiſe a lading
as faſt as they could plye it.
            
            
               ¶How the Captaine generall fought in Pandarane
with ſeuenteene great ſhips of the Moores, and
how he ouercame them and burned them.
Chap. 79.
               
                  THe Captaine generall perceiuing that of
force he muſt néedes returne, with all ſuch
ſhips as were laden, by counſaile of the
Captaines, and for ſecuritie of the King of
Coching and of the Fort there, did therefore
appoint and leaue in Coching a Captaine
generall, with whom he left a ſhip and two Caruels,
the one of Pedro Raphael, and the other of Diego Pieres.
This Captaine was a Gentleman called Manuel telez de
Vaſconcelos, whom the Captaine generall did preſent to
the King of Coching, who had a great deale more deſire,
that Edwarte Pacheco ſhould haue remained, for his good
ſeruice, and affection he bare him, as I haue ſayd. Howbeit
notwithſtanding,the effect of the vvordes, which the King of Coching ſpake to Edvvarte Pacheco at his departure. he durſt not demaund his tarrieng at the
Captaine generalls hands, forſomuch as he was of a very
ill condition. Edwarte Pacheco hauing knowledge of his going
for Portingale, purpoſed firſt ere that he departed, to
ſpeake with the King of Coching, the which he ſo did.
For whoſe departure the King remained very ſorrowfull,
requeſting him to tarrie if ſo be it were poſſible in the Indias,
and not to leaue him, for that as yet he did not think
himſelfe ſure from the King of Calicut, and alſo he tolde
him that he remembred that he had promiſed him ſundry
times not to goe away,The aunſwere that Edvvarte Pacheco, gaue to y• king of Coching▪
                   vntill ſuch time he had made him
King of Calicut, and ſince as yet he had not the poſſeſſion
of the ſame, he deſired him not to leaue him. Edwarte Pacheco
aunſwered him, that he left him now in a good time,
hauing his Countrey verye quiet, forſomuch as the King
of Calycut hath bene and now is abated ſo greatly of his

pride, that he néeded not to ſtande in no feare of him anye
more. For ſufficient proofe whereof was, if none other
thing, that now he ſawe the Moores of Meca to go theyr
way from Calycut as men deſperate for the loſſe of their
trade. Alſo that his going for Portingale was not but to returne,
and then to ſerue him for a longer time, and more at
his pleaſure. With this aunſwere the King was ſomwhat
ſatiſfied, and with the teares in his eyes deſired him to pardon
him, for that he did not giue him all that was his deſire,The good vvill of a thankfull minde is much more vvorth thē many gifts▪
                  
in recompence of the ſeruice he had done for him, in
conſideration that he was ſo poore, as he did well knowe.
Howbeit he intreated him, that of his Pepper which hée
had, he would take what he woulde.
But Edwarte Pacheco would haue nothing, ſaieng, that he
did truſt in God, that when he retourned to Coching, hée
ſhould finde him very rich, & in his proſperitie, and then he
would receiue reward of him. And with this he departed,
the King with all his ſubiects remaining verye heauie for
his departure. Moreouer, the King wrote vnto the king of
Portingale of all Edwarte Pacheco ſucceſſes in the warres,
and what he had done for him. After this the Captain gerall
departed toward Cananor, the xxvi. of September, carieng
in his companye thoſe Captaines which ſhoulde remaine
in the Indias. His good wil & intent was, to come to
an Ankor in the harbour of Panane, and there to viſite the
King of Tanor. But by reaſon of the ill weather they had,
and their naughtie Pilots they could not reach y• ſame, but
were driuen to Calycut and Pandarane. And from thence
he commaunded Pedro Raphael and Diego Pieres to go before
the Fléete, and to looke out, whether they could ſee any
ſhips of the Moores. Being ariued at Pandarane, & bearing
along the Coaſt with a ſmall winde, there came vpon them
x. Paros of the xvii. ſhips that were ther a lading. Our men
hauing ſight of them, began forthwith to ſhoote at them
with their ordinaunce. The other Captayns being a Sea
boord, and hearing the ſound of the ordinance, did returne,
and bare as cloſe by the winde as they could.

And hauing ſight of the ſhips of the Moores to be a ground,
came to Cananor by the Captaine generalls commaundement,
who immediately entered into counſaile, in ye which
it was determined by the whole conſent of his Captains,
that they ſhuld fight with thoſe Moores, and that they ſhuld
goe in their boates, for that their ſhips could not come néere
vnto them, by reaſon they were within the Barre. And for
that the enimies were many, that therefore they ſhould do
what they could to cloſe with the ſhips, the which as ſoone
as they had done, they ſhuld ſet the ſame a fire. This being
appointed, the Captaine general with all ye other Captains
of the Fléete, did imbarke themſelues in their boates, the
which were in all xv. in the which all the ſouldiers of the
Fléete did imbarke themſelues, and that with a great courage
for that they went to fight with their enimies.The great prouiſion of the Moores againſt ſo fevv ſmall boates. Theſe
Moores as I ſayd, had their ſhips within the Barre, lyeng
one cloſe by another, with their ſtearnes toward the land,
and in the moſt part of them wer many ſouldiers, ye which
were men of coulour white. Their weapon were bowes
and arrowes, and alſo they had much ordinaunce. And on
the land, at the entering of the barre were placed two péeces
of ordinaunce vpon a ſmall bulwarke which they had
made. Our men bearing néere to this barre, had ſight of the
Captaine generall, and how the Caruells were ſomewhat
farre off the ſhore, and that they came not, for that ye wind
was but ſmall, and therefore were perforce driuen to returne
backe for them, & to bring them by force of the oare
within the Barre, for to ſuccour their boates. The other
Captaines (although they ſaw him returne) went forward
by force of the oare, and at the entering of the Barre, the
Pellets fell as though it had rayned amongſt them. But
for all this they entered, ſhooting of all their Ordinaunce.
But as their enimies were farre more then they, ſo theyr
arrowes were without number. And for that our men by
reaſon they wer ſomwhat low vnder their ſhips, wer open
without any defence, therefore did they receiue great hurt,
not onely by their ordinance, but alſo by their arrowes.

Héere as it appeared, was all the force of the battaile: and
for all the ſtoutneſſe that was ſhewed by the enimies, yet
our men entred into the middes of all the multitude of the
ſhot, by force of the oare, in ſuch ſort yt it appered as though
the boats did flye,It had ben better to haue called vppon God to haue ſuccoured them in that extremytye, the men crying out S. Iames, S. Iames,
& with yt they laid thoſe ſhips aboord: ye firſt yt laid any ſhip
aboord was Triſtim de la Silua, as ſoone as he was within
the bar. And as ye men of this ſhip were many, ſo they did
ſhoote ſuch abundance of arrows & threw ſo many ſtones, yt
they made our men put off, who béeing off did immediately
cloſe with another, in y• which for that there wer not ſo
many, they boorded the ſame in deſpite of the Moores for all
their ſtoutnes, in ye which wer ſome of them ſlaine, & thoſe
that remained aliue leapt for feare into the water & ſwam
away. About ye ſame time yt 
                  Triſtim de la Silua had layde
this ſhip a boord, Alonſo de la cocta did the like vnto another,
which he tooke to be ye Admirall, of ye which a Turke
was Captaine with all his company, which were manye.
And at the boording of this ſhip, were throwen ſuch a multitude
of ſtones and darts, that it was a wonder to ſée. It
chaunced that before our men came to this ſhip, the enimies
ſhooting at them with a péece, ye which was lieng vpō
the vpper decke, with ye recoyling it rent out a péece of the
ſhip ſide, ſo yt ther was made ſo great a hole, & the enimies
not regarding it, thought it more néedfull to ſuccor yt fore-part
of their ſhip. And when our boat came hard a boord ye
ſame ſide where this hole was, our men did enter by the
ſame. The firſt that entered, was Alonſo Lopes Maſter, &
another Aluoro Lopes, who was ye things ſeruant, & is now
towne Clarke in Santaren, with 
                     〈◊〉
                   others. Theſe altogether
with thoſe yt came afterward ſo fought with their
enimies, that in the ſame conflict there were many ſlaine,
others hid themſelues vnder the hatches, & alſo others lept
into ye water, at ye which time the moſt part of them were
drowned, for that they wer laden with ſhirts of male. Immediatelye
one Pero Alonſo de Aguylar layde another
ſhip a boord, hauing in his company Lyonel Cotinuo, and

alſo Edwarte Pacheco, Vaſco Caruallo, Antonyo de Saldano,
and Ruy Lorenso, who all behaued themſelues very
valyauntly.The Mores for feare leap into the ſea, & drovvne thēſelues. And as ſoone as they had taken this ſhip, they
immediately ſet the ſame a fire, and it tooke the ſame very
furiouſly, ſo that thereby their enemies were ſo excéedingly
afeard, that the moſt part of them leapt into the water and
drowned themſelues. While this was a doing, thether
came the Captayne generall, with the Caruells, and béeing
entered within the Barre, he lefte them. Then one of the
péeces that were on the lande was ſhot off with a pellet,
which ſtrake the Caruell of Pedro Raphael in ſuch ſort, &
in ſuch a place, that with the ſame were thrée of his men
ſlaine and ten ſore hurt, and for lacke of winde, the floude
carried him vnder the forecaſtle of a ſhip, of thoſe that wer
not as yet layd aboord, the which had many men. And for
that the ſhippe was higher then the Caruell, who had the
ſame vnder his ſprit ſaile, therefore the enimies did enter,
and handeled our men very ill, for that they altogether did
ſet vpon them. Alſo there was another péece ſhot, with the
which the Maſter of the ſhip was ſlain, being at the helme
gouerning the Caruell, which being thus left at randon,
before that there came any other to the helme, the Caruell
fell vpon certaine Rockes, where ſhe remained till the battaile
was ended. The Captaine generall viewing the danger
that Pedro Raphael was in, commaunded him to bée
ſuccoured, and ſo it was done. Then our men entering into
the Caruell, the which was full of Moores, they behaued
themſelues ſo valyantly,Here vvas a great ſlaughter of the Portingals in reſpect of other battailes ſought. that they made them flye awaye,
but notwithſtanding all our men that were within ye Caruell
were ſore hurt. In the meane ſpace, all the ſhips of the
enimies were burnt, and this alſo at the laſt, in the which
was burnt great ſtore of Merchaundiſe, for that the ſame
was laden. Which was done the rather, for that vpon the
land there were many of the enimies which wer aſſembled
together. And for that of our men there were many hurt,
the Captain generall came his way with all his Captains
toward their ſhips, where he found that there were ſlaine

of our men xxv. and hurt an hundred and xxvii. men. But
for all this the victorie was great. For ouer and beſides
the burning of the ſhippes with all their riches, the which
was much, the Captaine generall was giuen to vnderſtand
by the Moores of Cananor, (to the which place from thence
he went) that ther were ſlaine in this battell two thouſand
men. With this ſpoyle the king of Calicut remained ſo ill
contented, that frō that time for a good while after, he could
not reſtore himſelf, for that his loſſe was great, beſides that
the Moores went from Calycut, by reaſon whereof there
was ſo great neceſſitie & lacke of victuals there, that the citie
remained almoſt vninhabited.

                  THe next day after, the which was the firſt
day of Ianuarie, the Captaine Generall departed
toward Cananor, for that there hée
went to take in the reſt of his lading. And
being there arriued, the Factor gaue him to
vnderſtand of the great victory that he had
gotten in Pandarane, and how the Moores were very penſiue
for the ſame, ſuſpecting that from thence forth all our
men might remaine in the Indias,

                   and that without feare.
For as their pride was before this victore great, ſo theyr
pretence was alwayes thought to be, to kill both the Factor,
and all thoſe that remained with him. The like tale alſo
did the king of Cananor alwayes tell. The Captaine Generall
béeing readie to departe, before his going he
made an Oration vnto Manuel Telez, and thoſe that remained
with him touching that which they ſhould doe, laieng
before them the great ſeruice that Edwarte Pacheco
had done, and therefore he woulde giue him no greater a
Fléete then Franciſco de Alburquerque left, and an hundred
fighting men in it. But after that he was departed,

there were in the Indias no more warres, for that the king
of Calycut remained as in caſe aforeſaid. The Captaine generall
being departed from Cananor toward Portingale, he
ariued at Mylinde the firſt day of September, where without
comming a land, he ſent Antonio de Saldanua to ye citie,
for many rich priſes which he had left there, & had taken
before at the Cape Quarda

                     um, where he went toward the
Indias. And from thence he directed his courſe toward Quiloa,
to recouer ther y• kings tribute which ye king wold not
pay. From thence he departed the tenth day of Februarye,
without chauncing vnto him any thing worth the writing,
arriued at Liſhborne the 22. day of Iune. 1525. with two
ſhips more then he carried out with him,1525. when he went toward
the Indias. All theſe were laden with great ſtore of riches,
for the which the king Don Manuel gaue him great
honour,Indeede this Edvvarte Pacheco vvel deſerued great honor & cō

                   and the like he did to Edwarte Pacheco, after yt he
vnderſtood what good ſeruice he had done him in the Indias,
& how by his meanes the Factorie was there mainteined, &
alſo the credit of his power. And for that all men ſhuld haue
knowledge of ſo notable ſeruice, immediatly vpon thurſday
next after the Captaine generals arriuall, was commaunded
to be made a ſolempne Proceſſion, as they vſe on Corpus
Chriſti day, in the which he went from ye high church,
vnto Santo Domingus, carieng with him Edwarte Pacheco.
In this Church there was a Sermon, made by the Biſhop
of Vizew called Don Diego Ortis, who brought in by
order, all that Edwarte Pacheco had done in the warres againſt
the king of Calycut. This feaſt was not onely kept
in Liſhborne, but alſo in Algaruy, & in all the cities & notable
towns of Portingale, which was ſo done by the kings
commaundement. Moreouer, he wrote of the ſame vnto the
Pope, by Don Ioan Sutill, which was then Biſhop of Sa
