            TO THE VVOR. shipfull and his most kind and louing friends, Master Israel Owen, and Mis. Bathshaba Owen his wife.
            
            
               IN the first publication of this Treatise (the argument whereof is more agreeable to the hungry desires of a troubled soule, then to the dainty appetite of them that seeke to haue their

eares delighted with fine inuention) I commended it to none, but vnto such as had the only neede thereof; euen to them that are weary and laden, which grone vnder that burden, whereof none can ease them, but only he that beareth vp all things by his mighty word. Heb. 13. And healeth those that are broken in heart, and giueth medicine to heale their sicknesse. Psal. 147. 3.
            
            At this second edition I haue been bold to publish it vnder your Worships name, not that I haue any higher conceit of it now, then at the first; to thinke it now worthier, then at that time, to beare it in the forehead thereof thename of any

worshipfull patron. For though it bee in some places altered, and in some enlarged: yet our bookes grow not vnder our hands, as our children doe, to become fairer, stronger, and wiser by continuance of yeeres: but they retaine (with little alteration) their first proportion and members. And this little booke, as it was at the first, so it remaineth no other, then a knitting together (in one continud discourse) of those obseruations, which in my publike exercise I deliuered in many Ser
                  •…
                mons, when I intreated of that text of Scripture, which I haue put downe in the beginning as the argument of the whole worke.
            But finding my selfe inde bted

vnto your loue, in a greater measure then I am able to make satisfaction for (which loue of yours to me hath continued now aboue twenty yeeres, and aboue all other proofes thereof, hath lately declared it selfe in a most free and kinde offer of extraordinary fauour) I haue been bold in this dedication to testifie vnto you. as I was able, my thankefull heart, which is the best recompence that my weake estate is able to affoord. And with this little booke which I offer vnto your Worshippes I offer vnto Almighty God, my most hearty praiers, that the father of mercy, & God of all consolations, will euer continue vnto you, and your posterity,

the abundance of his grace, both for a long and happy life in this world, and for a seasonable and christian departure hence, that after your yeeres bee compleate on earth, you may raigne with Christ for euer in Heauen. From my house in Woolchurch this thirteenth of Nouember. 1613.
            
               Your Worships wel-willer

            To him that is wearie and laden.
            
               
                  SALOMON in the Prouerbs affirmeth, that he that is full despiseth a hunnie combe. And one wiser then Salomon telleth vs in the Gospell, that the whole haue no neede of the Phisition: Idlely therefore should I offer my labour in this treatise to them that are full, and liue at ease, who bearing no burden, or in their strength not feeling what they beare, would reiect my offer as a mocke, & say vnto me, Brach ia da lasso potius prendenda natanti, offer your hand to him that is ready to sinke in the sloud, we haue

no neede, we sit safe vpon the shore.
            If these mens securitie be sound, I wish it may be durable vnto them: and as they haue no desire vnto, so I wish they may neuer stand in neede of the counsell conteined in this booke: this I wish them out of loue, though (out of iudgement) e know, if they belong to Christ, the tim will come, when they must beare a crosse, and follow him.
            But with hope of better acceptation, I offer my counsell here following vnto thee, that see
                  •…
               est the burden that thou bearest, and gronest vnder the burden that thou feelest. Salomon in the forenamed place telleth vs, that to the hungry soule euery bitter thing is sweete And the Lord Iesus affirmeth the sicke to stand in neede of the Phisitions helpe. Thy burden maketh thee as fainting labourer to long for releese, and the crumes of Gods mercy, easing thy ouercharged soule, would be acceptable to thee: and the paine of thy diseased spirit, more

sicke of thy tentation, then of a burning feauer, maketh thee desirous of the Phisions helpe, thou criest in thy griefe, Rebus succurrite lesis, helpe my greeued estate, and the offer and assurance of helpe and health cannot but bee ioyfull vnto thee.
            If thy greefe and wearines be occasioned, by any troubles of this life, if it grow from any secular & worldly cause, I haue reduced all such burdens vnto fower heades. Because either it is some want in our worldly estate, which commonly is the burden and trouble of the multitude: or, if wee bee that way well stored, it is some trouble domesticall and neare vnto vs, either in our selues or in our house habitation or kinred▪ or if we haue peace in our habitation, ioy in our kinred, friends and seruants, with life and health as we desire, then there is some more remoued person, or more remoued accident, that is the cause of greese care and feare vnto vs: or 
                  •…
               f abroad

aswell as at home, and among strangers aswell as among friends and neighbours, we liue without disturbance, yet we often finde difficulties in the duties of our callings, or we meete with oppositions, and are wronged with mistakings, & are euill rewarded for our well deseruing. Within the compasse of one of these foure heads fall all such secular and worldly burdens, and in the first place, I haue giuen aduice concerning these: perhaps not altogether such as some wise men, well seene and traded in worldly causes would giue, but surely such as an honest man should giue, and such as he must obserue, that looketh to obtaine ease and helpe from God.
            If thy trouble and greefe be of another kinde, if thy burden be spirituall, and t
                  •…
               e whole busines lieth more directly betweene God and thee, and either as an honest man thou art greeued that thou canst not serue him as thou shouldest, or so humbled that thou art greeued that thou

hast sinned against him as thou shouldest not, and fearest punishment for that sin: these troubles I haue reduced to two heades, for either the lustes of our flesh fighting against our soules, doe crosse vs in the waies of trueth and righteousnes, so that we cannot doe the good we would, and the euill we woud not, that we doe: and our desires being as the desires of the children of light, our deedes become as the deedes of the sonnes of darknes. Or else, hauing in time of our securitie, giuen way vnto our owne lusts, vnto the worlds allurements, and to Satans temptations, our sinnes are called to remembrance, are set in order against vs, with full manifestation of the wickednes of them, & of all that wrath that they haue kindled ni heauen, and of all that punishment that they haue deserued in hell, to the incredible terror of our conscience. Vnder these two heades of the lustes of the flesh, and accusing thoughts, of the dominion

of sinne, and the reward of sinne, fall all those spirituall burdens, that are heauie to the honest minde and to the humbled spirit. And of these I haue giuen aduice in the second place, that if it happen to be last learned, yet it may be longest remembred.
            And because the burden of accusing thoughts is euen as the gates of hell: for it is true that Saint Gregorie saith. Inter multiples humanae animae tribulationes, among the manifold tribulations of the soule of man, and the innumberable troubles of afflictions, Nulla est maior quam conscienti
                     •…
                   delictorum, there is none greater then the conscience of our sinnes. (Hee might haue said, none like it, none equall vnto it) for in other troubles, which are in a sort without vs, and striue to breake in vpon the heart, the troubled man (saith Gregorie) Ingressus in interiora mentis penetrali
                     •…
                  , entering in into
               
               the closet of his heart, there calleth vpon God where no man seeth: yea also he shutteth the dore of his heart against these assailing troubles, & keepeth peace within. But malae conscientiae tribulationem perferens, in arcano cordis, deum non inuenit: He that indureth this tribulation of an euill conscience, of a wounded conscience still accusing, findeth not God in the secret of his heart, hath not that free, as a retiring place, where quietly he may conser with God: but the plague beginneth within his heart, and the fire is kindled in the mouth of the spring, where the liuing waters of comfort should flow.
            Therefore in that argument I haue laboured to be more full, and not onely in a direct path haue led the afflicted sinner to see his sinne to bee pardonable, and himselfe to be allowed, yea commanded to craue forgiuenes of it, and God also bound by promise to grant it: which

he will doe, and (hauing promised) cannot denie to doe, if we seeke it aright and may doe without any impeachment of his holy and seuere iustice, hauing receiu
                  •…
               d full satisfaction in the death and sacrifice of his Sonne. But because the old serpent is subtile, and the poore sinner is weake, and that cunning craftsmaster of all tentations and snares, doeth sophistically frame many dangerous arguments, and putteth them into the minde and mouth of the affrighted and distempered sinner, making him ouer wittie to disclaime his part in God, and his inheritance in heauen: and ouer confident in his feare, and ouer resolute in his doubting, so to driue him (if it might bee, and which the diuel doeth most desire) into finall despaire; therefore haue I at large answered those arguments out of the word of God, and with the sword of the spirit I haue eat asunder the cords of those snaring obiections, which the enemie had bound more

fast and close then were the cordes of Gordius: and 
                  •…

            Others dedicate their workes to honorable patrons, because they are worthy of honorable patronage: I haue no such opinion of mine, I offer my labour, as a louing seruice vnto thee. They seeke a defender, I seeke a reader: not one to countenance or commend what is written, but one that might profit by that which I haue written: and therefore I present it to thee, that art wearie and laden, together with my heartie praier vnto God for thee, that it may be (by Gods blessing) a meanes of thy refreshing: intreating thee to read it thorough: & againe to read all that part that concerneth the last burden which is the burden of accusing thoughts, to thee the most heauie. Learne thou to depend vpon God▪ to feare him, and to abstaine from sin

And his sinne is proued not to be that sinne, whereof God neuer giueth repentance, and therefore neuer forgiueth it. pag. 208.
               17 Hence follow obiections made by his troubled minde And first he obiecteth that his sinne comes so neere that vnpardonable sinne, that the angry eie of heauen can se no difference: and though his sinne be pardonable, yet it is punishable: and lesse sinnes then his are punished therefore why not his. The seauenteenth Chapter answereth this obiection. pag 225.
               18 His second obiection is, the iustice of heauen cannot suffer such sinne as his to passe vnpunished: and the holines of heauen will not admit such sinners as hee to enter.

falsehood of his enemies; and at the hands of God he craueth (in iustice) their death and destruction. This appeareth in the next seauen verses of the Psalme.
               By this time his mind is somewhat calmed, hauing vented his griefe into the bosome of God, and therfore from the beginning of the sixteenth verse he speketh in another temper, partly professing his owne comfort, and faith (whereto euen the falshood of his enemies, detestable before God, gaue some strength) and partly instructing others how, in like assault of trouble, they may grow vnto like comfort.
               He professeth his owne recoueredWhat is in the text comfort in all these verses, beginning with the sixteenth, to the end of the Psalme (my text excepted) and he instructeth others in my text.
               Those whom he instructeth are such as himselfe lately was, namely men ouercharged with some heauy burthen.
               The instruction that he giueth them is the same that he followed himselfe when he was burdened, namely, by faith and praier to turne the burden

vpon the shoulders of God; in these words, Cast thy burden vpon the Lord.
               
               The successe that he promiseth them (obseruing his instruction) is the same that he found himselfe, namely reliefe helpe and deliuerance from God in these words, And he shal nourish thee: he wil not suffer the righteous to fal for euer.
               
               Some profitable obseruations may be drawen from the persons, instructing and instructed: and some from the instruction it selfe. These things shall be handled in order.

So that when God hath humbled his people by any crosse, that for the correction of their sinnes he laid vpon them, his compassion presently mooueth, and he pittieth them, as if they had borne twise more then they deserued: and thenceforth he commandeth al men that regard his voice, to comfort them with all good words, and to assure them of his fauour. Yea to speake vnto their heart, that is, all such words as may minister comfort to their hearts.
               The Apostle Paul giueth a like charge vnto vs, saying, Comfort the feeble minded.
                  1. Thes. 5. And most excellently in the Epistle to the Hebrews, Remember them that are

                  in bands, as if yee were bound with them: and them that are in affliction, as if ye also were afflicted in the body. We should esteem

the afflictions of others as our own afflictions, & take vpon vs in compassion that which they sustaine in passion. And both in our inward affection, and outward diligence we should study and worke their releefe, as we should study and worke our owne.
               For we are all of the same kind, condition, and quality: and nothing is befallen them, that may not quickly fall vpon vs: also we are, & should acknowledge our selues to be members of the same body, whose property (if they be neither dead, nor diuided from the body) is to feele the affliction of their fellow members, and diligently to seeke their reliefe. But especially finding God to be rich in mercy to vs, and euen a father of consolation, we should be mercifull as our heauenly father is mercifull, and should study to comfort them whom the God of all consolation loueth.
               It is the precious vse that God doth giue vs of good mens company in this life, and it is the thing wherein good men doe prooue themselues to be such, when they with the balme of comfortable

words heale the wounds of our grieued soules. It is the saying of S. Austin: Good men euen in this life affoord vs
                  Aug. epist. 121. cap. 1. 
                  no small comforts: for if pouerty pinch vs, if sorrow make vs sad, if paine in our body afflict vs, if banishment or any calamity vex vs, if good men be present, which know how to reioyce with them that reioice, and to weepe with them that weepe, and in conference to speake healthful things vnto vs, those sharpe things are made maruellously gentle, those heauy things are made easie, and those aduersities are borne and ouercome. For in a good man that hath bowels of cōpassion, it is most true, that one saith, aegrotanti animo medicus est oratio, his words will heale a grieued mind. Thus much of the person instructed.

                  righteous to fall for euer.
               
               This instruction consisteth of two parts, the first is a precept of aduice, the

second is a promise of recompence. The precept is in these words, Cast thy burden vpon the Lord: The promise is in the rest, and he shall nourish thee: he will not suffer the righteous to fall for euer. This promise giueth assurance of mercy from God according to our want and desire: and the precept directeth vs a sure course to seeke and speed of that wanting and desired helpe.
               In the precept, Cast thy burden vpon the Lord: for the better vnderstandingIn the precept▪
                   thereof, it will be good to consider, first what this burden is, secondly what it is to cast this burden vpon God. These things vnderstood, the precept is vnderstood.
               The name of a burden is familiar:What burden means many poore men liue by bearing burdens, and know wel the meaning of that name, when they feele the waight vpon their shoulders. But here it is vsed in a borrowed sence, for any thing that is heauy to the mind, breeding feare care and griefe: of which burdens there is great plenty in the world: and euery man high and low, at one time or other, is faine to play the porter, and beare

some of these burdens, some more heauy and some more easie, but euery man some.
               For order sake we may endeauour to bring these burdens vnto certaine heads, vnder which, if not all (for this fruitfull world breedeth new burdens daily) yet the most may be comprehended.
               And because in some of these burdens we haue immediatly and at the next hand to doe with worldly matters, and with men, in things belonging to this life: in others we haue immediatly and at the next hand to doe with spirituall matters, and God himselfe, in things belonging to our soules, and the life toBurdens secular & spirituall. come, therefore I will diuide them into secular and spirituall burdens.
               The secular burdens shall againe beFirst secular worldly cares. reduced to fower rankes, whereof the first shall be the burden of worldly cares, when a mans charge is great and his maintenance small, and he taketh care how to pay his debt, how to get meat and clothes, and other necessaries for him and his; which burden is made heauy vpon vs▪ sometime by the immediate hand of God, sending times of dearth,

and losses by fire and water, and other waies: sometime by other men, as by oppressors, deceiuers, theeues, bad debtors, false seruants, and riotous children: sometime it is increased▪ by our owne fault, through idlenesse, through plaie, through foolish bargains, through daintinesse of fare, costly apparell, and other courses of riot. And this burden may be called the burden of the multitude.
               The second ranke shall be of domesticall
                  Secondly, secular domestical troubles. 
                  troubles, either in thy selfe, thy family, thy kindred, or thy habitation. For where there is wealth at will, and that way no cause of care, yet Iob may languish being full of diseases, Dauid may haue a scornfull Michol to his wife, Abigail may haue a churlish Nabal to her husband, Rahel may mourn for her children because they are not, the sonne may be riotous and disobedient, the daughter may be dishonest, and between Amaon, Absolon, and Thamar, the father of the family may haue griefe enough: seruants may be vnfaithfull, and perhaps maintaine factions, thy kindred may be vnkind, or fall into some calamity, and

thy next neighbour may bee thy neare and great enemy, or thy house may bee visited with sickenesse, so that thy trouble shall breed euen in the nest of thy rest, in thine house, at thy table, in thy bed, and in thy bones, and there, and from thence shall thy vexation grow, where, and from whence thou didst promise thy selfe comfort.
               A third rank of these burdens shall beThirdly, secular more remote troubles. 
                  troubles more remote, growing from enemies and occasions further of. For many men haue peace at home, ioy in their obedient and louing wiues, comfort in their dutifull and sober children, content in their trusty and faithfull seruants, and sweet fellowship with their kind neighbours, so that their home and habitation is their happy paradise: and yet their▪ estate may be vndermined, by oppressors and deceiuers, their names may be disgraced by liers and slanderers, and their liues brought into danger, by blood thirsty and malicious enemies: and they touched with the calamitiesFourthly, secular difficulties of our calling. of their brethren abroad.
               A fourth ranke of these burdens shall be the difficulties following the duties of
                  
                  our callings. For though it be our honor and our crowne to performe the duties of our callings, yet they grow diuersly to be burdens vnto vs: sometime when more is required at our hands then wee are able to performe, either by the fault of other men, when we are called vnto publique seruices, before we be 
                     •…
                  ipe and fit for them: or by our owne great fault, when we, either couetously or ambitiously, intrude into callings, that we are insufficient for, seeking the reward and honor of the place, without regard of the seruice to be done in it. Sometime we are sufficient, and also painfull, and yet either God denieth successe, to exercise vs therby, or men oppose against vs, as Elimas did against the preaching of Paul. Sometime men are sufficient, diligent, and effect the seruice laudably, but enuious men misinterpret and misreport their doings, as the Pharisies did the workes of our Lord Iesus Christ, and in stead of praise they are rebuked and reprooued, and in stead of deserued and expected reward they are in danger of punishment. In all these cases the duties of our callings in themselues honorable,

yet become heauy burdens vnto vs. Vnder these foure heads I suppose all secular and worldly burdens may be comprehended.
               There are other burthens, wherein we haue to doe immediatly with God, in things that belong to piety, to peace of conscience, & to the life to come. Those may be reduced to two heads. The first1. Spiritua sinfull lusts. head and ranke of these burdens, are our sinfull lusts, our inbred corruptions, and infirmities, and the law of sinne in our members rebelling against the lawe of our mind, whereby it commeth to passe, that euen the best regenerate man, that feareth God, and loueth righteousnesse, that hath both his vnderstāding enlightned & his will sanctified, so that he wanteth neither knowledge, zeale, nor humility, yet can neither doe the good, that gladly he would, nor leaue vndone the euill that his soule abhorreth. This is no smal burden to the man that wold please God, and doe his dutie, that hee becomes his owne troubler against his owne will, and crosseth himselfe by corruption, in that wherein he taketh pleasure by sanctification. This made Paul
                  
the Apostle to crie out in these words, O wretched man that I am who shall deliuer
                  Rom. 7. 24. 
                  me from this body of death? It was death to him that such corruption was so preualent in his fraile body. And in another place he calleth the same law of sinne, a pricke in the flesh, the messenger of satan to

                  buffet him; because it was euer seruiceable to satan, and armed his hand against the holy feruant of God, so that whensoeuer the Apostle did set his heart to doe well, the diuell did beat him with the weapons of his owne corruption. This is no small burden to an honest minded man.
               The second ranke of these spirituall burdens are accusing thoughts, checkes2. Spiritual accusing thoughts. and terrors of conscience, the worme in thy bosome gnawing thine heart. This burden often followeth the former, as Zophar speaketh, When wickednesse was

goeth downe merrily, and is meate and drinke to the sinner, and he can not bee wonne from it, because it is his delight: but at last the time commeth according to the saying of God in the Psalme, I wil

According to this saying, God mustereth his sinnes together, and presenteth a view of them before the soule of the sinner: where the diuell as a great officer in that campe, setteth them forth in their colours, that al the contempt of God and of his commandements, all their vnthankfulnesse, and forgetfulnesse of their duty, all the violence, filthinesse, fury and disorder that accompanied their sinnes, appeareth fresh to the sinners vnderstanding: and what wrathin heauen, what shame on earth, and fire in hell, he hath made himselfe worthy of, and must now looke for.

                  neither is there rest in my bones because of my sinne: For mine iniquities are gone ouer my head, and as a waighty burden they are too heauy for me. His affliction was great, when the griefe of his minde changed the health of his body, and left no soundnes

                   by those sinnes deserued. Another time laden with this burden as he was before, he complainedPsal 40. 12 of his load as he had done before, saying Innumerable troubles haue compassed me: my sinnes haue taken such hold vpon me, that I am not able to looke vp: yea they are
                  
                  more in number then the haires of my head; therefore my heart hath failed me Needes must the assault of innumerable troubles follow the remembrance of innumerable sinnes: and these troubles, where they lay hold, doe depresse the heart, that the ouercharged waight cannot looke vp to the mercy feat of God. Yea where faith wageth battaile against fear, and keepeth the field well strengthened with many promises, and in the end preuaileth, restoring peace to the conscience yet there for a time (vntil the houre and power of darknesse passe ouer) terrors are great, when the charge of sinne lieth vpon the soule.
               See it in him that had the greatest assurance of all the sonnes of men: when the glorious sonne of God, our blessed Sauiour Iesus Christ, for our redemption was to take vp, and beare the burden of our sinnes, it did put him to vnspeakable paine, and was vpon his mighty shoulders a mighty burden. Hence cameMat. 26. 39 that tripled praier; O my father if it be possible, let this cup passe from me; neuertheles not as I wil, but as thou wilt. Thence came that agony that Saint Luke speaketh

of, that being in an open garden, and kneeling on the bare ground, about the middest of night, in a cold season ofLuk. 22. 44. the yeere, he fell into a great sweat, and his sweat was like drops of blood, trickling downe to the ground. Thence came that crie vpon the crosse, which was not the singing of a Psalme, but the true dittie of sorrow, and of a depressed soule, speaking as was before prophecied of him, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
                  Mat. 27. 46 
                  me? All these grew from the burden of our sinnes laid vpon him, that he bearing our sinnes in his body vpon the tree, we might be deliuered from sinne, to liue in righteousnesse. The burden therefore of sinne, when accusing thoughts once presse and charge the conscience, citing vs to appeare and answer before God for our offences, is a most heauy burden; the burden of the humble, and broken hearted man: these are the two rankes of spirituall burdens.
               Now vnder these six rankes, fower of secular burdens, two of spirituall; I suppose all those burdens may be comprehended, which lie heauy vpon vs in this world, and cause feare care and griefe

vnto vs; first care of the world: secondly, domesticall troubles: thirdly troubles more remote: fourthly, the difficulties that follow the duties of our callings: fiftly the sinfull lusts of our flesh fighting against our soules: lastly accusing thoughts, breeding terrors of conscience.

                  YOu haue heard what theWhat it is to cast our burden vpon God. 
                  burden is: now let vs consider what it is to cast this burden vpō the Lord. And hereof I will speake first generally, without relation to any particular sort of these burdens: and then particularly, with relation to the particular sorts of burdens before named: and in such order as they were named, but first generally.In generall
               
               What it is to cast our burden vpon the Lord, we may see by the words of Saint Peter, repeating this precept of our Prophet, and adding a reason in his words, and these are his words, Cast all your
                  1. Pet 5. 7 
                  care on him, (that is, on God) for he careth for you: that is when afflictions lie

heauy vpon you, and carefull thoughts, how to bee freed from those afflictions, troble your harts, quiet those thoughts in your selues, because your wisedome is defectiue, and your power is weake, and you are vnable to bring enterprises to passe: and doing that, which in such case; God commandeth and alloweth to bee done, commend your businesse and the successe of it to God by faithfull prayer: his wisedome is infinite, his power is omnipotent, and by him enterprises are brought to passe. This is Peters aduice, vsing our Prophets words, and only changing the name of burden, into the name of care, because our burdens doe breed our care: and this reason hee addeth in his owne words, for hee careth for you: that is, he taketh vpon him, and will dispose and effect all things for your 
                     •…
                  ase and safetie.
               This exposition of casting our burden vpon the Lord, is further warranted by the councell of Saint Paul, saying thus; Phil 4. 6. 
                  Be nothing carefull, but in all things let your requests be shewed to God in prayer and supplication, with giuing of thankes:
                  
that is, whereas others wrestling with the burden of their businesse, take much care how to accomplish what they desire, and gaze vpon their strength, their wealth, their wit and friends, to see what helpe these can affoord: doe not you in such sort trouble and turmoile your selues; but modestly considering and vsing such meanes as you haue, a
                     •…
                  d giuing thankes vnto God, whether your meanes bee great or small, intreat him in your faithfull prayer to prosecute the businesse for your not betraying your owne businesse by sloth and negligence, yet trusting only to God, and depending only vpon his blessing for successe, faile not continually to sollicite him with your prayers.
               
                  Dauid that is the speaker here▪ doth in another place by another speech of his, excellently interpret this, saying:Psal. 37. 3. 
                  Trust thou in the Lord, and doe good, dwell in the Land, and thou shalt bee fed assuredly: delight thy selfe in the Lord, and he will giue thee thy hearts desire: commit thy way vnto the Lord, and trust in him, and he shall bring it to passe: and he shall bring forth thy righteousnesse as the
                  
                  light, and thy iudgement as the noone day▪ wait patiently on the Lord, & hope in him.
               
               Here hee giueth many precepts, and euery precept hath his annexed promise. The precepts do follow one another in a most kindly order▪ and together doe teach vs what is to cast our burden vpon the Lord.
               First he commandeth vs to trust in the Lord, that is, to cal to remembranceVerse 3. the couenant that God made with vs, and the many promises that hee hath giuen vs: and seeing hee is faithfull and true in all his promises, to trust to that couenant, and to ground our faith vpon those promises.
               Secondly, hee commandeth vs to delight
                  Verse 4. 
                  our selues in the Lord, that is, to cheere vp our hearts in God, and to reioice in him, seeing wee haue a God both wise, mighty, mercisull, and saithfull, tied vnto vs by so large promises, more worth then all friends, fauourers, and helpers in the world. And this reioicing kindely followeth trust in God.
               Thirdly, he commandeth vs to commit our waies to the Lord: that is, afterVerse 5. our trust is setled in the couenant and

promises, and our ioy conceiued in hauing God so tied vnto vs, then, to fall to prayer, and to intreate God that he will take our cause into his hands, that he will bee pleased to prosecute the businesse for vs: and seeing hee is the gouerner and disposer of all the world and of all causes in the world, that hee will vouchsafe among all other causes, to haue care of ours.
               Lastly, he commandeth vs to wait
                  Verse 7 
                  patiently vpon God and hope in him: that is, when trust hath begotten reioycing, and trust and reioycing haue together shewed our desires vnto God in prayer, then to expect in quietnes of our minde such issue as he shall be pleased to giue, not failing to hope for all goodnesse at his hands.
               Among which degrees of our demenour to God-ward, for the referring of our cause
                     •…
                   to him, hee forgetteth not to insert this aduise▪ that wee doe good
                  Verse 3. 
                  and dwell in the land; that is, that continuing in our place and standing, we take no in direct courses, that may offend God, and pull a curse vpon vs in stead of a blessing: but that wee doe

the offices of our callings, behauing our selues in all things as becommeth wise and honest men, as in the sight of God, that we may in all good conscience expect his blessing. Thus doth he teach vs to cast our burdens vpon God.
               These rules being obserued, then he promiseth in all things ease of our burdens. First he promiseth sufficient maintenance, saying; Thou shalt be fed assuredly.
                  Verse 3. Secondly, hee promiseth content of heart. saying; He will giue thee
                  Verse 4. 
                  thy hearts desire. Thirdly, he promiseth cōuenient dispatch of all thy businesse, saying; And hee shall bring it to passe.
                  Verse 5. Fourthly, he promiseth iustification of all thy well doings against mis-construction and slander, saying; Hee shall bring forth thy righteousnesse as the light, and thy iudgement as the noone day: which all men cleerly discerne. These promises pertaine to the second part of my text, and they greatly commend the soundnesse of those rules of aduice, whereto they are annexed.
               And the rules of aduice doe interpret the casting of our burden vpon God. That my text speaketh of: and they shew

vs, that this is truely to cast our burden vpon God, namely, in our trouble to remember the couenant of God, and the promises of help, which as he gaue in mercy, so hee will fulfill in truth: and to trust vnto that couenant, and vnto those promises, that is, vnto that God that made that couenant, and gaue those promises: and thereupon to take heart vnto vs, and to cheere our selues in God, which hee calleth delighting in God, reioyeing that we haue so wise, so mighty, so mercifull, and so faithfull a God, so strongly tied vnto vs by so faithfull promises: and then in this gladnesse of our hearts to commend our businesse vnto God by praier, and to make him our aduocate, our Atturny, our solliciter, our factor, our agent, putting ouer our cause wholy to him, reseruing nothing to ourselues, but to put him in remembrance from time to time by our praier, and carefully shunning all vnlawfull shifts, that flesh and bloud may perswade vnto, doing that onely that hee by his word doth command vs. And hauing thus left the cause in the hands of God, to wait patiently and

quietly for such successe, as God shall be pleased to giue, thinking that alwaies best, which hee shall bee pleased to doe▪ This by Dauids owne interpretation is that casting of our burden vpon the Lord, which in the words of our text hee aduiseth vnto.
               For illustration of the doctrine, risingExamples of this casting off our burden. out of these places of Scripture; Let me alledge an example or two, wherein you shall see the true practise of these holie rules. While Abraham, hauing left his seruants, went with his sonne Isaac, to the place where he was commanded to offer him vp for a burnt offering vntoGen. 2217. God, Isaac spake vnto Abraham his father and said, My father, and he answered, Heere am I my sonne: And he said, Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the Lambe for the burnt offering? then Abraham answered, My sonne, God will prouide him a Lambe for a burnt offering. Heere is a notable example of casting our burden vpon God. Abraham was a true beleeuer, and in a case of no small trouble, & burden to his soule, he faithfully intended to doe, as God had commanded him: and for the successe of all

the businesse, he laid all vpon God, and left it to the disposition of his good pleasure, saying, God will prouide; so must we doe: and this is to cast our burden vpon the Lord.
               
               When Iacob, to shunne the fury of his brother Esau, from whom hee had won his father Isaacs blessing, and also to the end that hee might marrie in his kinred, and not with a daughter of Canaan, as Esau had done, was sent by his father Isaac in poore estate, with his staffe in his hand toward his vnckle Laban, by theGen. 28. 20 way he vowed a vow, saying▪ if God will be with me & wil keep mein this iourny which I go, and wil giue me bread to eat, & cloths to put on, so that I come againe vnto my fathers house in safetie, then the Lord shall be my God, &c. And vpon this vow and praier ma le, Iacob went forward. Here was a right casting of his burden vpon God, while desiring moderatly things necessary for him, for his foode, for his clothing, for his safety, and for his returne, hee seeketh them by no wrong courses, nor afflicteth his soule with care for them, but meekly by praier beggeth them at the hands of God.
               
                  When Dauid fled from Ierusalem, be cause of the rebellion of his sonne Absolom, and it was told him that Ahitophel that great polititian was ioyned with Absolom, being then in great heauinesse, as hauing a great burden fallen vpon him, going vp the Mount of Oliues, with his head couered, his feete bare, and weeping as he went, he praied vnto God and said, O Lord, I pray thee turne
                  2. Sam. 15. 31. 
                  the counsel of Ahitophel into foolishnesse. And afterward, when in his way Shemei had railed vpon him, and Abisha
                        •…
                     
                   in his heroical indignation would haue taken off the railers head, Dauid said to Abishai and to all his seruants: behold my
                  2. Sam. 16. 11. 
                  sonne, which came out of mine owne bowels, seeketh my life: then how much more now may this sonne of Iemini? suffer him to curse, for the Lord hath bidden him. It may be that the Lord will looke on mine affliction, and doe mee good for his cursing this day. Here doeth Dauid turne his burden vpon the shoulders of God, while he referreth all to his pleasure, and maketh request vnto him for helpe, vfing in the meane time much patience.
               The places of Scripture before alledged,

and these examples added for illustration, doe teach vs in generall maner for all burdens whatsoeuer, that th
                     •…
                  s is to put them off from our owne shoulders, and to lay them vpon the shoulders of God our strong helper, namely, if in our troubles wee remember God, thinke vpon his couenant and promises, his truth and faithfulnesse, his wisdome, mercy and power: and thereupon pray vnto him for his helpe, referring our businesse wholy to his pleasure, patiently expecting, and thankfully accepting what issue he shall be pleased to send. Thus much for this point, what it is to cast our burden vpon the Lord, considered generally without reference vnto any particular branch of our burdens.
            
            
               CHAP. VI.
               
                  NOw we are more particularlyTo cast our burdens in particular. to consider of this point of casting our burden vpon the Lord, with particular reference vnto those rankes of our burdens remembred before.
               But before I begin with them, seeing

wee must speake of particulars, I will byTwo burdens not to be 
                        〈◊〉
                      vpon God. way of caueat tell you of certaine particular burdens, that men doe cast vpon God against his liking: and they are not so much burdens lying heauy vpon themselues, whereof they seeke to be cased by the strength and mercy of God as they are burdens which with pleasure they binde, and cast vpon God to vex him withall. Such burdens wee are not here warranted to cast vpon God.
               These burdens are of two kinds, byFirst is a formality without pitty. two kinds of men prepared. The first kind of these burdens is the ceremonious worship of God, not accompanied with true reuerence in our hearts, nor with the conformable practise of godlinesse in our liues. This burden God doth complaine of by the Prophet Esay, saying. Bring no more oblations in vaine, incense
                  Esay 1. 13. 
                  is an abomination vnto me, I cannot suffer your new Moones, nor Saboths, nor solemne daies (it is iniquity) nor solemne assemblies. My soule 
                        •…
                     ateth your new Moones, and your appointed feasts, they are a burden vnto me, I am weary to beare them. And when you shall stretch out your hands, I wil hide mine eies from you They

were formall in the outward seruice of God: therein they did well; but because they wanted the reuerend feare of God, and their hands were defiled with the bloud of their oppressions and cruelties, therefore their dutifull formality was abhorred of him that loueth truth in the inward affections: though the ceremonies of that formality had been appointed by himselfe.
               This burden is the pleasure of hypocrites, and by them prepared to weary the Lord withall, by such as feare men more then they feare God: and loue the praise of men more then the praise of God: and draw neare vnto God with their mouthes, and honour him with their lips, but they remoue their hearts far from him, and are like vnto painted Sepulchers, shining without, and stinking within, so they appeare vnto men to be holy, but within they are full of hypocrisie, and in secret commit all iniquity. This inward and hidden wickednesse is it that disgraceth their (otherwise laudable) outward and open obedience.The second is an open wicked life
               
               The second kind of these burdens is

                  an open wicked life, when men cast off both the feare of God, and also modesty, so that they neither make conscience of their doings in regard of God, neitheir make dainty of doing open euil for feare of the opinion of men. Of this burden the Lord complaineth by the Prophet Amos, saying: Behold I am pressed
                  Amos 2. 13 
                  vnder you, as a Cart is pressed that is full of sheaues. If a Cart be ouerladen, it lieth heauy vpon the Axeltree, that maketh a whining and groning noise, and sometime breaketh, laying both Cart and loade in the dust. So presse they God with the loade of their sinnes, vntill hee grone vnder them, and complaine by his Prophets, and at last ouerthroweth them, casting both them and their sins by his iust iudgement into hell.
               This burden is prepared by bold and contemning sinners: by men that rise early to follow drunkennesse, and are strong to drinke strong drinke: by men that commit adultery, and assemble themselues by companies in harlots houses, and rise in the morning like fed horses, euery man neighing after his neighbours wife: by men that lay wait

as he that setteth snares, and maketh pits to catch men, and fill their houses with the fruit of deceit as cages are filled with birds: by men that haue two kinds of waights and measures, and vse to sweare falsly: by men that say desperatly, we will doe whatsoeuer thing goeth out of our owne mouth, and our strength shall bee the law of vnrighteousnesse: by mockers that say where is the hope of his comming? and as the Prophet Esay
                  Esa. 5. 19. testifieth of them, draw iniquitie with cords of vanity, and sinne as with Cartropes. Of which audacious men that neither feare God nor man: and are neither religious to regard conscience, nor ciuill, to regard good name, the world is full.
               These are the two kinds of burdens, the ceremonious worship of God, without truth and piety, prepared and throwen vpon God by dissembling hypocrits: and the bold transgression of all law and order, prepared and cast vpon God by wicked contemners: these are those particular burdens, which by way of caueat I thought fit to warne you of, that you meddle not with casting these

vpon God, least he cast both you and your burdens into eternall destruction in hell.
               But our heauy burdens that presse our soules, and breed feare, care, and griefe vnto our mindes, whereof we desire to be eased, those wee may and must cast vpon God, and are, not onely allowed, but allured also to turne them off vpon him.
            
            
               CHAP. VII.
               
                  OF these burdens, some areSecular burdens. 
                  secular, concerning this world, and no way touching Heauen or Hell: and some are spirituall meerely concerning our soules, and the life and death thereof, and the seruice and fauor of God. Of the secular there be foure kindes.
               The first secular burden is worldly
                  The first is worldly cares. 
                  cares, when a mans charge is great, and his maintenance small: the common burden of the poore; though somtimes also wringing the backe of the rich. This burden groweth heauy, sometimes

by the worke of Gods hands, sending more charge, lesse gaines, deare times, and vnexpected losses: sometimes by the malice of other men, some oppressing by power, some deceiuing by fraud, and some wasting by riot whom thou didst trust: and sometime by thine owne fault, as by sloth, by sumptuous courses in apparrell, diet, building, and by foolish bargaines. This burden makes men grone out these words, what shall wee eate? what shall we drinke? wherewith shall we be clothed? how shall I pay my debts, maintaine my credit, and answer the charges of my place?
               To cast this burden vpon God is toWhat it is to cast this vpon God. proceed by these rules: First to consider the bounty of God that giueth to all both life and breath and all things. Secondly, vpon consideratiō of this bounty, to fall to praier, that he will be pleased to extend that bounty vnto thee. Thirdly, to apply thy selfe diligently and faithfully in some honest calling, wherein God may blesse thy hand to fill thy mouth, fleeing all vnlawfull shifts. Fourthly and lastly to take heede of excesse. This excesse is double, first the excesse

of desire, which we calcouetousnes when a man is not content with that that is sufficient: secondly, the excesse of spending which we cal riot, when a man hath a humour to waste intemperatly.
               The first rule is to acquaint our seluesFirst to learne Gods bounty. with the bounty of God that we may cō
                  ceiue hope of help from his hand, wherof the Prophet saith, thou openest thine hand
                  Psal. 145. 16. 
                  and fillest al things liuing of thy good pleasure: this boūty of God wil appeare vnto vs, partly by the testimony of the Prophets partly by the euidence of his own works & liberal deling with his cretures.
               His bounty is testified by the Prophets,
                     Testified in his word. Psal. 104. 14. & other holy men. Dauid thus speaketh of it: He causeth grasse to grow for the cattel, and hearbes for the vse of man: that he may bring forth bread out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of man▪ & oile to make the face to shine, & bread that strengthneth mans heart. This is a maruelous work of Gods prouidence, & an euidence of great bounty, that out of the drie earth he bringeth forth food for vs. Of his special care among men, to deale bountifully with them that feare him, the Prophet Esay giueth testimony, saying,Esa. 65. 13. 
                  thus saith the Lord God, behold my seruant
                  
                  shal eate, & you (that is the wicked, for to them he speaketh) shalbe hungry: my seruants shall drinke, & you shalbe thirsty: my seruants shal reioice & you shalbe ashamed. When the wicked shal want and in their want be confounded, the righteous shal abound, and in their abundance reioyce. Excellent is the testimony of our Sauior Christ in the Gospel of S. Math. saying,Mat. 6. 26. 
                  Behold the fowles of heauen, for they sowe not, neither reap, nor cary into the barns, yet your heauēly father feedeth them: are ye not much better then they? if God extend his bounty to creatures of so smal regard, to whom also the means of prouiding their food by sowing, reaping, & reseruing is denied, that notwithstanding he sendeth them sufficiency: how much more wil he prouide for the children of men, that are of better regard with him & to whom he hath giuē means of prouiding their own food by sowing, by reaping, & by reseruing their store. Excellent is the testimony of Saint Paul among the vnbeleeuing Gentiles at Listra, vnto whom hee commendeth the true God that made the world, before the vaine Idols which they serued, saying, hee left
                  Act. 14. 17.

                  did good, and gaue vs raine from heauen, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with foode and gladnesse. Such was his bounty euen toward them that worshipped idols, and being his creatures, he failed not to supply them with necessaries
                     •…
                   how much more wil he not faile his own children, which worship him in spirit and truth. Such testimony do the Prophets and other holy men giue of the bounty of God, that openeth his hand, and filleth all things liuing with his goodnesse.
               And the euidence of his works is veryTestified by his workes. cleare, to approue vnto vs the same goodnesse. He giueth daily and yearely store of foode, and nourisheth life in all his creatures that participate life. But because the worke of God in his ordinary prouidence is not obserued and esteemed as it ought to bee; let him that is burdened with the cares of this life, by reason of want, consider the records of Gods bounty, making prouision by myracle, when ordinary prouision failed. How he prouided for Israel in the wildernesse
                  Exo. 16. 35. forty yeares, sending them bread from heauen euery mourning. How he

prouided for Elias in a time of dearth,1. Kings 17. 4. causing the Rauens to bring him bread and flesh euery morning and euery euening, his drinke being the water of the riuer Kerith. And how after the riuer was dried vp, he multiplied the meale in the Widowes barrell, and the Oile in the1. Kings 17. 14. cruse, so that there was sufficient for her selfe, her son, and the Prophet her guest. How he multiplied another widowes oile,
                  2. Kin. 4. 4. so that many vessels were filled, and a great summe of mony was raised to pay her debts and to releeue her selfe & her sonne. And how hee prouided for the people of Samaria, when the famine2. Kin. 7. 1. was great among them, so that ouer night the head of an Asse was sould for foure-score pieces of siluer, and the next day a mesure of fine flower was▪ sold for one sicle, and two measures of Barly for a sicle: a thing so vnlikely, before it came to passe, that a great man hearing the promise of it ouer night, said, though
                  2 Kin. 7 2. 
                  the Lord would make windowes in heauen could this thing come to passe? these & many other like records doe approue to vs the care of God for men, and his bountie towardes them to bee such, that if

ordinarie prouision faile, by reason of any iudgement of his, he will by miracle prouide for his, rather then they shall want. And for the man burdened with care by reason of want, that would bee eased by casting his burden vppon God: this is his first rule, to consider those and such other testimonies of Gods bounty, that there may be grounded in his heart a good perswasion of Gods care, that hath giuen life, to giue nourishment to maintaine the life that he hath giuen.
               The second rule, and next steppe ofSecondly, to pray for this bounty. casting his burden vpon God, is, out of this well perswaded heart, to pray vnto the same bountifull God, that giueth food vnto all flesh, and feedeth the yong Rauens when they call vpon him; and offereth the pray to the yong lions, that roaring in their hunger, seeke their meate; and clotheth the grasse of the field with admirable beautie, that he will be pleased to send foode and clothes, and other necessaries for thee and thine.

WhoseMatt. 6. 11 precept and prescribed order, doeth not onely commaund vs to pray for these things, but doeth also giue vs comfortable hope to obtayne all things that wee pray for.
               A third rule and further degree of castingThirdly, it is to follow some lawfull calling. this burden vpon the Lord, is, that we take heede of all vnlawfull shifts, as of theft, of oppression, of fraude, and of idle begging (by which courses men cast their burden, not vpon the back of God, but of the deuill, seeking ease and helpe at his hands) & that we apply our selues diligently in some honest calling, that wee may first earne, and then eate our bread, according to the doctrine of the apostleEphe. 4. 2

                  exhort by our Lord Iesus Christ, that they worke with quietnesse, and eate their owne bread. And to such, honestly trauelling in some good calling, GOD will giue bread and all things needful, as the Prophet saith: Trust thou in the Lord and doe
                  Psal. 37. 3. 
                  good, dwell in the Land, and thou shalt bee fed assuredly. And afterward hee saith in another Psalme, Blessed is euery one that
                  Psal. 128. 1 
                  feareth the Lord, and walketh in his waies: when thou eatest the labor of thine hands, thou shalt be blessed, and it shalbe wel with thee. Tremelius, according to the Hebrew reades it thus, Thou shalt enioy, or thou shalt be fedde with the labour of thine hands. So that God blessing the labour of his hands, that trauelleth honestly in a lawfull calling, will giue him food and needefull things, and ease the burden of his charge.
               Whereas the man that refuseth to trauel in an honest calling, rebelleth against Gods order, and maketh the burden of his want to be heauier. He rebelleth against the order of God, that casting Adam
                  Gen. 3. 19. out of Paradice to till the ground, established this as a law for him and his posterity, In the sweate of thy face shalt
                  
                  eate bread, till thou returne to the earth. Therefore ease and slouth must not bee the delight of him that would win case of his burden of want at Gods handes. And that hee maketh the burden of his want heauier, that refuseth to labour, Salomon teaches vs in the Prouerbs, saying to the sluggard; Yet a little sleepe, a
                  Prou. 6. 10. 
                  little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleepe, therefore thy pouertie commeth as one that trauelleth by the way, and thy necessitie like an armed man. The traueller commeth to thine house, when thou doest not looke for him, and when the armed man commeth he wil not be shut out. In this maner, stealingly as the traueller before thou art aware, and forcibly as an armed man, that cannot be driuen away, wil pouerty & necessity come vppon him that will not take paines to earne his owne bread. Yea it is the iustice of GOD to whippe with want the idle droane, and hee forbiddeth bread to be giuen vnto them, as Pauls words to the Thessalon▪
                   declare, saying, When we were

                  with you this we warnd you of, that if there were any that would not worke, that hee should not eate: if this discipline of the

Apostles were put in practise, a number of idle men and women swarming in the Land, would quickely be reformed. But while iustice sleepeth among magistrats and officers, and charitie is become foolish among well disposed people, slouth and idlenesse, the breeders of all vngodlinesse, vnrighteousnesse, and vncleannesse, liue and grow fat and lustie among vs: and true pouertie (in the little ones of Iesus Christ) is defrauded of her due reliefe, intercepted by sturdie droanes. But our laden wight, whose burden is want and worldly care, must for his ease apply himselfe vnto some honest course of life.
               The fourth and last rule, which pertainesFourthly, it

                      to flie all excesse. to the right casting of thy burden vpon the Lord, when the cares of this life, by reason of want, are heauie vpon thee, is, to take heede of all excesse. Now this is double, the first is the excesse of desire to get, the second is the excesse of thy minde in spending: the first excesse knowes not what is enough, and therefore is euer caring, though there bee no neede: the second excesse consumeth more then enough, and therefore maketh

want, and by want bringeth care where none▪ needed to be, if moderation had been steward. The first excesse is couetousnes, the second is prodigalitie.
               Many men by Gods mercie are prouidedExcesse of desire to haue. of sufficiencie, but they are not therewith contented, and will still take care when they neede not. Salomon in his time among the vanities vnder the Sunne, obserued it for one, saying, There

                      be satisfied with riches. He had no great family to nourish, hee had no posteritie to prouide for, and yet could hee neuer be satisfied; the more he had, the more he desired, and his thirsting after wealth increased with euerie draft of gaine & aduantage that he took. He that so exceedeth in his desire, how can hee be eased of the burden of worldly cares? for, what God giueth for his ease, hee conuerteth into a new load; such men increase their burden, and make it heauier by endlesse desire.
               Of this excesse Christ warneth vs to take heede, saying vnto vs, Take heede

                  and beware of couetousnesse, for though a man haue abundance, yet his life standeth not in his riches. The greatest store maketh not the most secured life: and he
                     •…
                   that thinkes to liue long in plenty, is oft sodainely taken away from all, and in his abundance did euer liue in want, bicause his boundlesse desire neuer thought him selfe to be full, when yet he possessed superfluitie. Therefore is contentednesse so much commended in the Scripture.1. Tim. 
                        •…
                     . 6 The Apostle Paul saith, Godlinesse is great gaine, if a man bee content with that he

                      hath: for wee brought nothing into the world, and it is certaine that we can carrie nothing out: Therefore when we haue food and rayment, let vs there with bee content. This vertue of contentednesse hee must striue for, and intertaine, that desireth to bee cased of his burden of worldly cares. And let him remember a notable saying of the Prophet in the Psalmes, A
                  Psal. 37. 16 
                  smal thing vnto the iust man is better then great riches vnto the wicked. It is not so much the measure of thy possession, as Gods loue and fauour with thy possession, that maketh it to bee an case of thy burden: and let him learne to follow as

neere as he can, the example of S. Paul, who thus prosesseth of himselfe, saying,Phil. 4. 11. 
                  I speake not because of want, for I haue learned in whatsoeuer state I am, therewith to be content: and I can be abased, & I can abound: euerie where in all things I am instructed; both to be ful, and to be hungrie, and to abound, and to haue want. This lesson of contentednesse with things necessary, when our desires are kept within due bounds of moderation, helpeth greatly to case him that is pressed with the burden of worldly cares, by reason of some wants.Excesse of 
                        •…
                     ending.
               
               The other excesse is the excesse of spending: that excesse is vnthristinesse, prodigalitie & waste, whereby many that had no burden of this kinde, and were well prouided for doe make vnto themselues a burden of want, to breake their owne backe withall. And I thinke there was neuer age, wherein this excesse was so excessiue as in this age, while some man looseth at play in a day, more then he gathereth of his reuenew, or winneth by his labor in a weeke, perhaps in a yee

And I know it, that some haue all the points they vse tagged with gold, as little looked after, and as soon lost as if they were of brasse. By which courses, before they are aware of it, they bring a faire portion to beggery; for excesse and riot are in a mans estate as moathes in his garment. The m

               Call these rules to minde; in them thou hast sure direction how to turne the burden of thy care, growing from want, vpon the shoulders of God for thy ease. First make thy soule acquainted with the bountie of God in prouiding for his people, by considering the testimonies and euidences thereof, that thou maiest trust in him. Secondly, being perswaded of Gods bountie, pray him to extend that bountie vnto thee. Thirdly, vse faithfull diligence in some honest calling, shunning all vnlawfull shifts, which are neuer blessed. Fourthly, take heede of all excesse; of the inward excesse of desire in thy hart, and the outward excesse of waste in thy spending. Hee that doeth these things, casteth his burden vpon God in the cares of this life, and shall not bee

disappoynted. To him pertayne these promises, and all such like, Thou shalt be

                  THE second branch of theseThe second secular bur den is domesticall troubles. particular burdens, is the burden of domesticall troubles, which may bee heauie vppon him that is farre and free from the former burden, hauing for wealth the world at will. I call them domesticall troubles, when the matter and occasion of his troble is neare vnto a man: as in these cases; When strife and offence ariseth between husband and wife, betweene parents and children, betweene masters and seruan's, and betweene neighbour and neighbour: or when the hand of God, in some grieuous calamity, in some dangerous sickenesse, or in death is heauie vpon thy selfe, thy wife, thy childe, thy seruant, or some other of thy familie, or

some neare friend. This is a grieuous burden, when a mans vexation breedeth in the very nest of his rest, as in his house, his table, his bed, and his bones. And this is domesticall trouble.To cast this vpon God, rules generall & particular.
               
               This burden you may see by the cases before named to be very variable. For the casting of this burden vppon God, there are many rules: some are more common to be obserued in all domesticall troubles; some are more priuate, fitting for this or that domesticall trouble. In this chapter I will set down those rules that are common to all these troubles.The first generall, i

               And first of all, it is a common rule, in all these troubles, pertaining to the right casting of them vpon God, that we arme our soules with patience, and quietly beare whatsoeuer God is pleased to lay vpon vs. For shall we be willing only to receiue good things at the handes of God, things agreeable to our hearts wish, and when he is pleased, eyther for our triall, or for our correction, or for any other holy cause, to lay vpon vs euill and hard things, vnpleasant to flesh and bloud, shall wee then murmure against

his worke? God forbid. Iob iustly reprooueth such a course, saying to his wife; Shall wee receiue good things at the

                  hands of God, and not receiue euill? As when good things come, it is fitte to acknowledge Gods free mercie, and to be thankefull: so when euill things come, it is fit to acknowledge Gods holy iustice, and to be patient. And this course of casting our burden vppon the Lord, our blessed Sauior the Lord Iesus Christ commends vnto vs, and a sure way of finding ease, saying vnto vs, Take my
                  Mat. 11. 29 
                  yoake on you, and learne of mee, that I am meeke and lowly of heart, and you shall find rest vnto your soules: that is, whatsoeuer burden falles vpon any of you, either after my example, or for my sake, (which I account to be my burdens, for I labor in him that labors vnder those burdens) let him not murmure, let him not spurne impatiently against it: but let him take it meekely vnto him, as I did my death. This shal bring ease to his soule, for this is to cast his burden vpon God, while for Gods sake he is willing to beare his good pleasure.
               This patience a while continued, will

make thy yoake easie, and thy burthenPatience easeth by breeding ioy. light; and whilest others crie and complaine, thou shalt reioyce in God: therefore haue the Apostles, both in their practise and in their doctrine, ioyned together patience and reioycing in the times of trouble, because continued patience breedeth ioy. Of their practise ioyning patience and reioycing together, Paul speaketh thus; Also we reioyce
                  Rom. 5. 3.

Which while hee reporteth, doeth hee not there with all deliuer, that troubles patiently borne, doe giue experience of Gods fauour, giue hope in Gods mercie, and breede a confident and vndaunted spirit

In their practise, could this course be kept in wisedome▪ In their doctrine, could this rule bee giuen in soundnesse, if the patient bearing of all our troubles were not a readie and very soueraigne way of casting our burdens vpon the Lord for our ease? therefore haue care of this in the first place, to possesse thy soule in patience.Reasons why to be patient.
               
               And if it seeme to any man a hard thing to bee patient in trouble, let him not feare to attempt, euen by this course of patience, to cast his burden vpon the Lord. For there are many reasons, that perswade thereunto. First, the burden, while it continueth, is a sure testimonie of Gods loue vnto thee. Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews saith, My sonne,
                  Hebr. 12. 5 
                  despise not the chastening of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loueth he chasteneth, & hee scourgeth euerie sonne whom hee receiueth. The chastisement of the Lord by these troubls, is an euidēce of his fatherly loue: and therfore we ought with the patience of children to beare it. Secondly, while God out of his loue continueth

the burden of this trouble vpon thee, he doeth it only for thy good. As the same Apostle teacheth vs in the same Epistle,Heb. 1
                        •…
                     . 10 saying, Hee chasteneth vs for our profit, that wee may be partakers of his holiness
                        •…
                     . The effect of those troubles intended of God, is our benefit, that wee may bee brought to haue neerer fellowship with God in holinesse; and therefore they are to bee borne with patience. Thirdly, though God seem to continue our burden long, and in the meane time to shew small kindnesse vnto vs, yet sure the end of them will be with a blessing. As Moses saith of the worke of God, leading the children of Israel for many yeres together through a wearie wildernes, that he did it to prooue them, that he might doe
                  Deut. 8. 16 
                  them good in▪ the latter end. And if the cōclusion of our trouble, like the wrestling of Iacob, shall be with a blessing, it is to be born with all patience. A fourth reason there is to be regarded aboue all other reasons, & of force to make a man patient euen in the fire, namely, that if wee suffer with Christ, wee shall raigne with Christ, and when we haue indured patiently a while on earth, we shalbe rewarded

honourably for euer in heauen. Hereof the Apostle Paul thus speaketh; Our light affliction, which is but for a season,
                  2 Go
                        •…
                      4. 17 
                  causeth vnto vs a furre most excellent, and an eternall weight of glorie. Affliction shall bee rewarded with most excellent glory: light affliction with a weight of glory: and momentanie affliction with eternall glorie: therefore to bee borne with all patience. He that considereth these things, that if God do send trouble, it is of his fatherly loue vnto vs as vnto sonnes: that in these troubles he onely intendeth our good, to bring vs to haue fellowship with him in holinesse, that our troubles shal bring peace and a blessing in the end: and lastly, that GOD will bring vs from a Crosse to a Kingdome, and turne our Crowne of thornes into a crowne of glory: He that considereth these things will bend his heart to beare his burthen patiently. Whereby hee certainly turneth his burden vpon God for his great ease, making a heauy burden to be light, (which while it is patiently borne) melteth and falleth off from the heart, like raine falling from the high grounds: so that after

a while he despiseth the troubles, that at the first were fearefull vnto him; and they seeme vnto him moale hils, that at the first shewed (a farre off) like mountaines. This is the first common rule of casting our burden vpon God, alwayes to be obserued.
               By this rule, if it be Husband or Wife
                  Vse of this patience in domestic all troubles. that causeth vnquietnesse, we are taught to suffer their vnquietnesse, whome wee can neyther reforme nor remooue, and not to make a great flame of a small sparke, by prouoking the vnquiet to more vnquietnesse. If it bee Parents or Children that cause vnquietnes, Parents must be honoured, and Children must be cared for, though in some things they grieue vs: and God may amend them at the last, if wee in the meane while, bearing patiently their infirmities, continue our duety to them, and our prayers for them. If it be Masters or Seruants that cause vnquietnesse, the Seruants in patience must bee subiect to their Maisters with all feare, not only to the good and curteous, but also to the froward: they can not shake off their Maisters, while the dayes of their seruitude continue:

and the maisters in patience must do vnto their seruants that which is iust, not omitting any meanes whereby they may reforme them: and in the end, the master hath power to ease himselfe of an incurable euill seruāt, by dismissing him. If it be neighbour against neighbor that causeth vnquietnesse, this rule teacheth, not to render euill for euill, nor rebuke for rebuke; but contra
                     •…
                  iwise in patience to blesse, and to doe all good offices in neede, whereby thou shalt haue peace in thy heart, howsoeuer thy neighbour bee disposed to contention. And if thy home-trouble be painefull sickenesse, either vpon thy selfe, or vpon some of thy houshold, or some▪ other neare and deare vnto thee: this rule teacheth thee (whatsoeuer other meanes for recouerie of health be vsed) to beare thy visitation meekely, humbling thy selfe vnder the mighty hand of God in euery thing. If thy trouble bee the death of any whose life thou didst desire, this rule will teach thee (knowing the death of the righteous to bee vnto them the beginning of true life) to giue glorie to God with a quiet mind. This patience in all things

will giue thee ease of thy burden, according to the saying of our Sauiour; Take
                  Mat. 11. 29 
                  my yoake on you, and learne of me, that I am meeke and lowly in heart: and ye shall finde rest vnto your soules. This is one common rule.
               A second common rule in all theseThe second generall is prayer. troubles, pertaining to the right casting of them vpon God, is, that we pray vnto God, crauing his helpe, who for ought wee know, hath therefore layed these troubles vpon vs, because we haue been negligent in prayer: that now feeling sensibly in our sorrow, our neede of his helpe, wee might amend our old negligence, and fall to praier. And surely, whether God did send our troubles for that cause, or no; yet this is most sure, that prayer is a most profitable course for the easing of our trouble: which God commandeth with promise of ease, saying by the Prophet, Call vpon me in the
                  Psa. 50. 15 
                  day of trouble, so will I deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie mee. And the Saints haue alwayes vsed it with happy successe of ease. As the Prophet testifieth, saying, These called vppon the Lord and hee
                  Psal. 99. 6. 
                  heard them. So did Iacob, when returning

from his vnckles, hee heard that Esau was comming forth against him with foure hundred men, hee said thus vnto God, I pray thee deliuer me from the hand
                  Ge▪ 32. 11. 
                  of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I feare him, lest hee will come, and smite mee, and the mother vppon the children: And according to his desire, God deliuered him from his feare: for his brother and hee met in peace, and departed one from another in peace; so did Moses, when the Aegiptians pursued the Israelites, and the Israelites feared the Aegiptians
                  Ezo. 14 15 before the red Sea, The Lord fayd vnto Moses, Wherefore criest thou vnto mee? for Moses in his heart prayed earnestly vnto God, and God did deliuer him from his feare, opening a passage for the Israelites thorow the waters of the red Sea, and drowning in the floud the Aegiptians that presumed to follow: so that Israel sawe the Aegiptians
                  Exo. 14. 30 
                  dead vpon the Sea banke. Wee neede not stand vpon particular examples, hauing a generall rule that neuer fayleth, the Prophet saying, The Lord is neare
                  Ps. 145. 18. 
                  vnto all that call vpon him, yea, to all that call vpon him in trueth: hee will fulfill the
                  
                  esire of them that feare him, he also will beare their crie, and will helpe them. Now seeing the saints doe thus in their troubles pray vnto God for ease, and do thus at the hands of God obtaine ease when they pray in their troubles, it is euident, that to pray vnto God in our trouble, is a worthy rule of casting our burden vpon God in all domesticall, yea in al whatsoeuer troubles.
               And let no man say, there is no needNeed of praier. in these troubles to trouble God with our praiers, because he knoweth both what we suffer, and what himselfe hath determined to do, for these reasons thou oughtest the more gladly to pray, because God doth vnderstand thy want before thou complaine, and is determined to succour before thou intreate him▪ thy labour with such a God cannot be in vaine.
               And this know, thou hast great imploiment for thy praiers in these and such like troubles. First thou hast needeFirst for thy selfe. to offer vp praiers vnto God for thy selfe that he will giue thee patience and wisedome to demeane thy selfe aright vnder these troubls, that thou maiest neither

be a murmurer against God, grudging at those troubles nor increase thy troubles by dealing indiscreetly, and frowardly with them that are the causers and occasion of thy troubles: nor maiest erre, and be wanting in vsing good remedies to heale and reforme them that are the causers of thy troubles. And if thy domesticall trouble be sicknesse in thine owne body, how necessary it is to pray vnto God, to giue thee patience to send thee health, to forgiue thy sins, and to prepare thee for death? when Iames the Apostle exhorteth to reioice for temptations, and to continue in patience, till patience haue her perfect worke, because these things require an extraordinary wisedome, he further aduiseth vs to pray vnto God for that wisedome saying; If any of

safely to grow out of it, and to recouer peace and health.
               Secondly, thou hast need to offer vpSecondly, for them that trouble or grieue thee. praiers vnto God for them by whose meanes thou art troubled, or for whose sake thou art grieued.
               Sometime thou art vnkindly vsed, either by thy husband or wife: either by thy parents or children, or such as haue stept into the roome of parents and children, and haue those names by law giuen them, not by nature due vnto them: or else by thy master or seruant: or by some friend or neighbour. For these thou hast great cause to pray vnto God that he will giue them better minds, and let them see their fault with mislike of it, and see what becommeth them to doe, and giue them a heart to doe it. If they continue in their frowardnesse, shall they not continue to be troublers vnto thee? then as thou desirest an end of the trouble that they put thee to, so desire that God will giue them a better and wiser heart. This rule is included within that more generall rule of our Sauiour Christ in the Gospell, I say vnto you, loue your enemies, blesse them that curse you, doe good
                  Mat. 5. 4

                  to them that hate you, and pray for them that hurt you, and persecute you. If we ought to pray vnto God for all that hurt vs, then also for them of our owne house habitation and kindred that hurt vs: and so much the rather for those at home, and so neere vnto vs, because they haue more opportunity to hurt vs, then they that are farther of. And what are we to begin praier for them? Two things: one that God would forgiue their fault, which we also must forgiue. Another that he will giue them a heart to see, and to amend their fault. God in his holy iustice doth therefore many times stir vp domesticall troubles to men, because they are negligent in domesticall praier neuer commēding vnto God either husband or wife, child, seruant, kinsman, friend; or neighbour, neuer making any request for grace and wisedome to bee giuen vnto them. When Dauid had brought the Arke of the Lord into the place that he had prepared for it vpon the hill of Sion, and had offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, it is said, that he blessed the people in the name of the

Sa. 6. 20. for them of his house, that they might prosper, and that he might liue a comfortable life among them. Also IsaackGen. 25. 21 Gen. 49. 48 
                  praied vnto the Lord for his wife. And Iacob blessed all his sonnes, euery one of them blessed he with a seuerall blessing. And Booz the Bethlemite comming into the field, among his seruants and reapers, saluteth them with a praier vnto GodRuth. 2. 4. Dan. 6. 10. for them, saying, the Lord be with you. And Daniels custome was, three times a day in his house, to pray vnto God, who praying in his family, could not in his praiers be vnmindful of his family. From so holy and worthy examples, learne thou to pray for thine: while thou enioyest peace with them, pray that they may not proue a trouble vnto thee: and when thy troble growes from thē, pray that God will giue them a mind more agreeable to peace. So fit for the ease of thy burden, is praier for them by whom

thou art troubled.
               Sometime thou art not vnkindly vsed by them, yet thy trouble groweth from them, while thou art grieued for some calamity hapned vnto them, and takest care for

                  he helping of them. In this case there is speciall neede of praier to be made for them. And it is a speciall point of casting thy burden vpon God. God speaking to the Israelites, saith of himselfe, I am the Lord that healeth thee; thatEx. 15, 26▪
                   is, all the health and helpe both of thee and thine must come only from my hand. And in another place, I kil and giue life, I wound and I make whole. That is, I send sicknesse danger and hurt, to makeDeut. 32. 39. men seeke vnto me▪ and againe I restore health safety and peace, when men doe seeke vnto mee. And these things being the workes of Gods owne hand, they should faile very much, of casting their burden vpon God, that being burdened with griefe for the sicknesse and calamities of their neighbours, friends, kinsfolke, and family, should forget and neglect to pray to God for them. Dauid praied for his child in a most humble and earnest manner when it was sicke.

For Dauid besought God for the child, and
                  2. Sam. 12. 26 
                  fasted, and went in, and lay all night vpon the earth. The Centureon whose faith is commended in the Gospell, praied vnto the Lord Iesus for his sicke seruant, sayingMat. 8. 6. vnto him, master my seruant lieth sick at home of the palsie: and when Herod had cast Peter into prison, with purpose, after the feast, to bring him forth to the people to be slaine, earnest praier was made of
                  Act. 12. 5. 
                  the Church vnto God for him. The saints of God haue alwaies obserued this as a most safe and sure rule of casting their burdens vpon God, when they were troubled and grieued for the sicknesse and calamitie of others, to pray vnto God for them, to restore their health, their peace, their liberty, and their comfort: that in the recouered comfort of them that were afflicted, they might recouer comfort that were afflicted for them There is therefore in these domestical troubles imploiment for thy praiers to be offered to God for them, either by whose meanes thou art troubled, or for whose sakes thou art grieued.

of thy kindred, of thy friends, and of thy neighbors, whether thou be wronged by the vniust and vnkind dealing, or else grieued for the calamity and sicknesse of some: that neither the sinne of them that wrong thee, nor the calamity of them for whom thou art grieued, may spread any further, to the corruption and damage of the rest. If Esau grieue his father Isaack, and his mother Rebecca, by taking a wife of the daughters of Canaan, haue not Isaack and Rebecca cause to pray to God for Iaacob their other sonne, that he may not doe as his brother had done? when certaine of the followers of the Lord Iesus Christ had left him, taking offence at some words of his (concerning the eating of his flesh and drinking of his blood) which they vnderstood not, Iesus said to the twelue,
                  Ioh. 6. 67. 
                  will ye also goe away: he was carefull that an euill example might not spread like a contagious sicknesse, to corrupt the whole company of his disciples. And (more agreeable to the cause that wee haue in hand) when Iudas one of his family (the diuell entring into his hart) had couenanted with the Priests and pharisies,

to betray his master into their hands the Lord Iesus, heauily charged with a burden of trouble, growing from his treason, taketh occasion from his wickednesse, to pray vnto his father for the rest, saying, Those thou gauest me, haue I

And now come I to thee, and these things speak I in the world, that they might haue my ioy fulfilled in themselues, &c. The child of perdition (Iudas the traitor) being lost, the Lord hath care of the rest and praieth for them, that they might euer reioice in him. Euen so euery louing man, that can take pleasure in the health and honest cariage of his friends, neighbours and family, when one is ill at ease, and when one doth giue offence, he will heartily pray to God to preserue the rest, that they may continue in health, and that they may continue to deale iustly, honestly, and dutifully.

And likewise the disobedience of the wife may driue the husband vnto that course that after becommeth her heauy burden. Can the party that first did wrong without prouocation, be offended with the party, that in the second place did amisse being prouoked? somtimes the fondnesse and negligence of parents, that wil not instruct, nor (when needess) correct their children, nor in any thing restraine them of their owne will, or else the euill example of the parents, makes them become wanton, disordered, and euill conditioned, as it fell out in Hell his children: and in the end the parents see and heare things of their children, that grieue their hearts, and out of their disobedience, and insolency they are wronged, and it cannot be otherwise,

folly cleaning to the soule of the childe, but that, when the soule is not husbandly tilled by the discipline of the parents, it must bring forth weedes of euill behauiour: sometime the child that complaineth of the vnkindnesse of parents, hath by his owne folly, by his disobedience and riotous courses giuen vnto his parents (of themselues tender and louing inough) cause to be vnkind, to change their countenance, to shorten their allowance, yea to shut the dore against him, and to settle his inheritance vpon some other.

He suffereth them also to exceede decorum and comelinesse of seruants in their apparel, and to be abroad at vnseasonable times, with other yong persons (and what youth and liberty, wanting an ouerseer,

will doe, wise men know:) also by his owne euill example of riot and vnthristinesse, hee becomes vnto his seruants a plaine corrupter, they thinking themselues out of danger of reproofe, while they tread in the steppes of their masters and gouernours: or else an euill master dealeth vniustly and vnkindly with a faithfull seruant, and being so brought vp, and so prouoked, no maruell if at length they breed their Masters trouble. Sometime the seruant, being both well taught and well intreated and hauing no iust exception against the gouernment and vsage of his Master, out of the lewdnesse of his owne euill heart, or harkening to the counsell of ill company, becommeth disobedient and vnfaithfull, and prouoketh his master to take strait courses with him. Sometime also an vndiscreet man, dwelling by a neighbour of peaceable disposition, presumeth vpon his neighbours softnesse, and offereth him wrong in such manner, as ouercommeth patience, and makes the quiet man to stir againe: and then hath he trouble in his habitation, and feeles himselfe compassed

Thus stopping the fountaine of cause giuen by himselfe, the streame of offence takē by others wil soone drie vp (the common rules of patience and harty praier to God, withal not neglected.)
               If thy vnkindnesse to thy wise, and thy bad husbandry made hir vnquiet, vse her more kindly, and proue a better husband, and she shall be quiet. So let the wife by more dutifull and modest behauiour recouer hir husbands loue.
               If neglect of discipline, with too much

remisnesse in gouerning children and seruants, and thine owne euill example among them were cause of their disorder, vse thy fatherly and masterly authority better, and giue a better example, and thou shalt haue them in better obedience. The child also and seruant, becomming more obedient and more faithfull, shall soone recouer the loue and fauour of their Parents and Masters.
               And if thy neighbour were prouoked to vex thee, because thou hadst first iniuriously vexed him, make thy peace with him for the first wrong, and abstain from offering a second, and hee will liue in peace with thee.
               Surely if the occasion of a mans domesticall trouble grew from himselfe, this is to cast his burden vpon God for his owne ease, in the feare of God to remooue the occasion, to reforme the disorder in himselfe, to giue satisfaction, to seeke reconciliation, and to hold a better course afterward: and to doe this in patience, ioyning withall praier vnto God, that he wil giue, both to himselfe, and to them that were his troublers, wisdome and grace, that hee may no

more giue, and they may no more take any such offence.
               But if a mans domesticall troublesNot occasioned by our selues. grow not from himselfe, giuing the occasion, but onely from their owne euill heart, that troubled him, so that he can say as Samuel did: Whom haue I done
                  1. Sam. 12. 3 
                  wrong to? Or whom haue I hurt? And as Dauid said, O Lord my God if I haue done
                  Psal. 7. 3. 
                  this thing, if there be any wickednesse in my hand, if I haue rewarded euill to him that had peace with me, (yea I haue deliuered him that vexed me without a cause) then let mine enemy persecute my soule and take it. If the burdened man be himselfe faultlesse, and the euill heart of the euill doer be the onely fountaine of his euill deede; as the Scriptures testifie, and daily experience shewes it to be most true, that there are such neighbours, and such domestikes, that of themselues without cause giuen, are troublesome: as froward wiues, with whom it is as vnquiet dwelling as with a Dragon: and euill husbands that haue neither wisdome nor honesty to respect the weaknesse of the womans sex, and to intreat them with due mildnesse; and children

riotous and disobedient, that will be ruled by no counsell nor order of parents: and parents so vnnaturall and carelesse, that they haue no regard of their children: and seruants so slothful, vnfaithfull and murmuring, that they will neuer be good: and masters so vnreasonable and cruel, that their seruants liue vnder them a miserable life: and neighbours and companions to whom it is a pastime to doe euill, according to Salomons words, As he that faineth himselfe mad, casteth fire-brands, arrowes,
                  Prou. 16. 18 
                  and mortall things, so dealeth a deceitfull man with his friend, and saith, am I not in sport? Thus falleth it out many times, that the quiet man giuing no occasion, yet receiueth iniury to his great molestation.

If he interpose his hand of deliuerance, to make it of short continuance (which is to be praied for) then he will put an end to thy trouble, either by changing the minde of thy troubler, or by weakning and crossing his malice, or else by remouing thy troubler from thee, or thee from thy troubler: wherein till his will be reuealed by his worke, he is to be attended in patience, and to be intreated by praier.

               By this rule, if a man bee troubled with an vnquiet wife, and would be eased by the good worke of God, in reforming hir, he must pray vnto God, that he would be pleased to giue he
                     •…
                   a better heart. And hee himselfe must in all louing manner teach her what is comely

for her to doe as a woman, as a wife, as a mother, as a mistresse, & as a neighbour, wheresoeuer he hath found he
                     •…
                   to erre, and by her errour to haue been the cause of his trouble. So did Iob checke and reforme the errour of his wife, when she prouoked him to curse God, saying; thou speakest like a foolish woman: What?
                  Iob. 2. 10. 
                  shall we receiue good things at the hands of God, and not receiue euill?
               
               So on the other side, if a woman be troubled with a bad and vnquiet husband, and would be eased by the good worke of God in reforming her husband, shee must pray vnto God, that he will be pleased to giue her husband a better heart: and she her selfe must in all dutifull manner helpe that change, actempting it, partly by gentle wordes in season spoken, and partly by her owne louing and modest behauiour, that is very forcible to reclaime euen a froward minde. By words Abigail attempted to reforme the churlishnesse of Nabal her husband, chusing a fit season to tell him of the danger thereof, the next day after, when he had slept away his drunkennes. She obserued opportunitie, & so should

all women doe. Therefore doeth Bathsheba
                  Pro. 31. 26 say of a vertuous woman, Shee openeth her mouth in wisedome, and the law of grace is in her tongue. And such words of wisdome from the tongue of his wife, an honest man shold not refuse to heare, and vnto wise words spoken in season, let her adioyne her milde and humble behauiour, by which much good may be done vpon him, as testifieth Saint Peter, saying; Likewise let the wiues be subiect

                  to their husbands, that euen they which obey not the word, may without the word be won by the conuer sation of the wiues, while they behold your pure conuersation, which is with feare: So ought the wife, both both with milde words and good behauiour, helpe the reformation of her husband.
               These prescribed rules, for the man to desire, and helpe the reformation of his wife that is froward: and for the woman to desire, and helpe the reformation of her husband that is disordred, when the one prooues the others burden by their errour, giue no countenance vnto the disgracing complaints, vnto the vnciuill taunts and checkes, vnto the brawling

words & blowes, and other euill vsage, that passe now and then between man & woman, when one is offended with another: surely God is not the author of such dealings, neither do the married that vse such dealings▪ cast the burden of their domesticall troubles vpon God, os take 
                     •…
                  ny course to make burden lighter, but they do increase it, and make it heauier.
               By the same rule, parēts & masters, burdend with disobedient & disordred children & seruants, and desirous to turn off their burdē vpon god, are taught to pray to God for the reformation of their children & seruants, & to put their own helping hand to the worke, vsing their fatherly and masterly authoritie, and wisedome to draw them back from iniquity. In which godly attempt, fathers and masters haue alowāce frō God; yea they are not▪ only warranted of God to do it, but it is a charge laid vpon them, children & seruants being committed to them, not onely to doe them seruice, and to be at their cōmandemēt, but rather to receiue education, & instruction from them. And when parents and masters faile, and become carelesse of the instruction of their

children & seruants, and in the right gouernmēt of them, God doth often (in his iustice) punish the fathers & masters neg ligence, with the childrens and seruants disorder. And when parents & masters are carefull to instruct & gouerne aright their children & seruants, then God (in his mercy) requiteth that care and diligence with the obedience and faithfulnesse of children and seruants. Salomon saith in the Prouerbs, The rod and correction
                  Pro. 29. 15 
                  giue wisedome, but a childe set at libertie makes his mother ashamed. Here iustice repayeth with disorder in the child, the neglect of instruction and gouernement in the parents. The same Salomon saith a gaine, Correct thy sonne, & he will
                  Pro. 29. 17. 
                  giue thee rest, and will giue pleasures to thy soule. Here mercy repayeth with contenting obedience in the child, the wise and careful gouernement of the parents. To masters also, that their seruants may not breede their vnrest, Salomon in the same place giueth these Items, by which hee might well suppose, that wise men would take warning, A seruant wil not
                  Pro. 29▪ 19 
                  be chastened with words▪ though hee vnderstand, yet hee will not answer. This is

plaine enough, that for some seruants, & the right gouernment of them, something more then words is sometime necessary.Pro. 29. 21. And againe he saith, Hee that delicately bringeth vp his seruant from his youth, at length he wil be euen as his sonne. This is plaine enough, that a delicate life with liberty and pleasure, is not to be allowed to seruants by any rule of good gouernement, left to thy griefe he take vppon him to bee more then a seruant.
               Yet these rules for parents to desire and helpe the reformation of disobedient children: and for maisters to desire and help the reformation of disordered seruants, giues no defence vnto vnnaturall parents, that are tyrants to their owne children: and to cruel masters, that increase the proportion of worke, and number of strip

                  uants, if while they haue carried themselues duetifully, and deserued well, their parents or maisters, out of their owne vnkindnesse, and cruelty, doe prooue a heauy burden vnto them: because it may please God to ease them of that burden, by chaunging the mindes of their parents and maisters, it belongeth vnto them, as a speciall point of the casting of their burden vppon the Lord, to pray vnto God for their parents and maisters, that hee will be pleased to open and amend their hearts, that they may see their errour, and may reforme the same, & learne to deale more kindly (which belongeth to parents) and to deale more iustly (which belongs to maisters;) and whereas they haue no authoritie to admonish, to teach, to correct, as their parents and maisters haue, yet with due reuerēce they may be bold, obseruing opportunitie, and vsing decent and humble speeches, somtimes to tell them what they think to be fit. How

reuerently, when Saul wronged Dauid and had spoken to Ionathan his sonne, and to all his seruants, that they should kill Dauid, which was Ionathans griefe, because he loued Dauid: how reuerently did Ionathan labour to make Saul his father see his errour, saying vnto him, Let not the King sinne against his seruant,
                  1. Sa. 19. 4. 
                  against Dauid: for hee hath not sinned against thee, but his workes haue beene to thee verie good: for he did put his life in danger, and slew the Philistim, and the Lord wrought a great saluation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and thou reioycedst: wherefore then wilt thou sinne against innocent bloud, and slay Dauid without a cause? And when Naamat the Syrian tooke great indignation at the Prophet Elisha, because he came not out and laid his hands vpon his leprousie to heale it, but commanded him to wash himselfe seauen times in the waters of Iordan, which he iudged nothing so vertuous as the waters of Damascus; which indignation of Naama

                  wouldest thou not haue done it? How much rather then, when he saith vnto thee, wash and be cleane? Such words of mildnesse, spoken in fit season, and with reseruation of due reuerence, may by seruants and children be vsed to their fathers and masters, to induce them to see their former errour, that it may be a meanes vnder God to change their mindes.
               But this liberty can no way iustify the insolence and vnduetifulnesse of many children & seruants, that being restrained by the seueritie of their parents and masters, grow into discontent, & speake contemptuously and raylingly, without all reuerence, and without all regarde, either of the authoritie of their parents and masters, or of the subiection and duety that they owe vnto them.
               By the same rule is euery one, whose domesticall trouble growes by the errour of his neighbour (if hee would bee cased, which may be the changing of his neighbours minde) taught to pray vnto God for the bettering of his neighbour: and to put his owne helping hand to so good a woorke, by admonishing his neighbour neighbourly. And hee hath

precepts from GOD to warrant that course. Moses saith, Thou shalt not hate
                  Leu. 19 17 
                  thy brother in thy heart, but thou shalt plainely rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer him to sinne. So that there wanteth charitie in him that will not louingly tell his neighbor of his errour. And God doeth often in his iustice make thy bad neighbour, to be a cause of trouble vnto thee, because thou, knowing his disorders, hast not told him of them, that he might amend. A like commaundement giueth the Lord Iesus, saying, If
                  Ma
                        •…
                     . 18. 15 
                  thy brother trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his fault betweene him and thee alone. That is, if his faul▪ be bent against thee, as the chosen obiect of his malice: or directed another way, it light vppon thee, to the hurt or hazard of thy life, thy peace, thy profit, or thy good name: or if his misdeede were neither intended against thee, nor did light vpon thee, but onely thou art grieued in thine honest soule, to behold so vngodly dealing: in these cases thou art commāded of the Lord to tell him of his fault, that if hee be curable he may amend. And because thou knowest not but that it may please

God to ease thy burden of domesticall troubles, making them of short continuance by reforming the troubler, it is a speciall point of casting this burden vpon God, to pray for the amendment of thy neighbour, and to put thy helping hand thereto, by gentle and neighbourly admonitions.
               But this liberty of telling thy neighbour his fault, giues no allowance of rayling, and reproaching, and publique disgracing of men, by casting their infirmities and faults in their teeth. A christian man must abhorre all such bitter courses, remembring what the Apostle Peter saith▪ 
                  Loue couereth a multitude of
                  1. Pet. 4. 8. 
                  sinnes: That is, a right charitable man, though hee seeke to reforme his neighbour, by telling him of his sinne, yet he will not disgrace or shame his neighbor by publishing his sinne.
               It may please God to ease thee of theBy weakening the power of the trobler burden of thy domesticall trouble by weakening the power, and crossing the malice, and abating the pride of thy troubler, that either hee shall not dare, or shall not be able to proceede any further in thy vexation: as he daunted the

their cunning, that they might not preuaile to doe the mischiefe that they intended. And so far it is lawfull for thee to pray for their disappointing.

For those whose examples are before remembred, were the Prophets of God, and Apostles of the Lord Iesus Christ, who knew the reprobation of those against whom they praied, and so rather pronounced the knowen iudgements of God, then the priuate affections of their owne hearts: and if they pronounced their owne affections, they were affections conformed to the known iudgements of God, not contending to guide & moue Gods iudgements. So doth S. Austin affirmeAugust. in Psal. 35. of all such praiers, saying, those things which are spoken in the forme of wishing, are things opened by a spirit of prophecying and when they say, let that be done, and let that be done, it is no other then if they had said such and such a thing shall come vnto them No

                  Pray▪ for them which hurt you and persecute you. Therefore if God be pleased to ease vs of the burden of our troubles by▪ weakning the power, asswaging the pride, and malice, and by disappointing and scattering the purposes and counsel of out enemies, we in seeking this grace at his hands, may pray against their deuises, but not a against their persons. And therefore by this rule is no countenance giuen to the dire imprecations, and bitter curses that many vncharitable men powre out against their troublers.
               Perhaps it may please God to easeBy remouing the troubler from thee, or thee from him. thee of this burden of domesticall troubles, making them short, either by remoouing thy troubler from thee, or by remouing thee from thy troubler. And this remoue all may be made, either by death or by some other course. And thereto some rules pertaine, in the right obseruation whereof a wise man for his ease casteth his burden vpon God.
               
                  If the remoue be to be made by death:If his remoue b

                  Psal. 36. 9 And to him also pertaines all power ouer death, to hastē it & bring it forward. The same Prophet saith of the samePsal. 68. 
                        •…
                     0 God; To the Lord God belong the issues of death.) This maner of remoue by death it is not lawfull for thee to desire, much lesse by thy hand to further, either in the death of thy selfe, or of thy troubler. If God be pleased to doe it for thee, either in remouing thy troubler from thee, or in remouing thee from thy troubler, it is euery way a worke of his mercy toward thee.
               If God by death remoue the troubler from thee, it is his mercy to thee. When God by death had remoued Absolom, that had greatly troubled his father and made him flie from Ierusalem, then was that domesticall trouble at an end, and Dauid returned in peace to Ierusalem. That remoue of the trobler by his death was Gods mercy to the troubled. So likewise if God by death remoue thee

from thy troubler, that also is Gods mercy to thee, for so he giueth thee rest, as the Prophet Esay speaketh, saying; The righteous perisheth, and no man considereth
                  Esai 57. 1. 
                  in his heart: and mercifull men are taken away, and no mā vnderstandeth that the righteous are taken from the euill to come. This is also Gods gracious mercy deliuering him from trouble.
               But for thee to be an actor in these things, it is altogether vnlawfull, God hauing giuen to thee a commandement to the contrary; Thou shalt not kill. Dauid
                  Ezo▪ 20. 13 would neuer so be eased of his troubler Saul: he would not doe it himselfe, nor suffer others to doe it, though he often had opportunity, but waited on the hand of God, saying to Abishai, that would haue smitten him while Dauid and he stood by Sauls beds side; As the Lord liueth,
                  1. Sa. 26. 10 
                  either the Lord shall smite him, or his day shall come to die▪ or he shall descend into battell and perish: the Lord keep me from laying mine hand vpon the Lords annointed. And at last he was eased by Sauls death without laying his hand vpon him, it is the remedy of tyrants and bloud-thirsty persons, to seeke ease of

their troubles, by procuring the death of their troublers. And it is the remedy of faithlesse & desperate men, to ease them of their burden of troubles, by remouing themselues from their troubles and troblers by their death. So did Saul, Ahitophel, and Iudas. Those men that so remoue themselues and others, cast not their burden vpon the Lord, who is the giuer of life, but cast it vpon the diuel

Isaack sent his sonne Iacob away from his brother Esau, when Esau in his anger had sworne to slaie him. Dauid fled from the hand and Iauelin of Saul, and shifted for himselfe by remouing from place to place: and he conueied all his fathers house into the land of Moab from Sauls reach. The Lord Iesus oftentimes withdrew himselfe from the fury and rage of the Iewes. And he gaue his disciples a rule for times of persecutiō, saying, when they persecute you in this city, flie vnto another.
                  Mat. 10. 
                        •…
                     3 And many honest men haue remoued

their habitations, to auoid ill neighbours, and to be out of the reach of too neare troublers. And many haue purged their houses of vnquiet spirits, both children & seruants, as they might doe, when they could not amend them in the house.
               But yet I must tell you, that if children and seruants increase the burden ofRulet concerning remoue of children or seruants. thy domesticall troubles, this turning them out for thine ease, must be the last remedy that must be vsed; and all other meanes for their amendment must first be attempted, because children and seruants are not sent of God into thine house, only for thy pleasure and ease, but they are committed vnto thee to be brought vp vnder thee, and to be trained by thee to grace and good behauiour. And that is a thing that thou must looke vnto somewhat more then only to thine owne quiet, that thou maist be able to answer God for their soules. If any member of the body be diseased and out of temper, putting the head and whole body to paine, a man will not at the first cut off that member, but first he vseth all meanes to cure it, and doth

with much patience endure the weaknesse of it, and will suffer a blind eie, rather then plucke it out of the place; and a lame hand rather then cut it of; and a sore leg rather then let the sawe come to it: and that shall be the last worke, if he doe it at all. And children and seruants are members in the body of thine house; therefore he is but a bad head and gouernour, that presently, because children and seruants are troublesome, that thrust them out of dores to seeke their ease. By remouing them must be the last attempt. But if other attempts first made by thine own authority and wisedome then after by the counsel of neighbors and friends, and lastly by the power and countenance of the magistrate, will doe no good vpon them, but they persist in their wickednesse, and proue incurable, to the hurt of thy selfe and others in thy family; Then the eie, the hand
                  Mark. 9. 43 
                  and the foot that offendeth may be cut of. If children or seruants, or any other that may be turned away, be as tender and deare as thine eie, as seruiceable as thine hand, as necessary as thy foot, let them depart. The whole is to be respected

before a part, & the head before a member. Thus God may be pleased to shorten thy sorrow by a remoue and shift of place between thy troubler and thee.
               If God be pleased to continue thy

                      thy trouble continue long. trouble long, all the former aduises must be practised as time affordeth opportunity, because thou know st not what happy houre of thine ease God hath set downe in his good purpose. And those two common rules of patience and praier must neuer be neglected.
               And for the mittigating of thy sorrowConsolations to comfort in long troubles. vnder that burden, consider these things that follow, and they will bring much ease vnto thy mind. First that it is the common condition of all Adams children, in this world to haue troubles; as Iob speaketh most truly, Man that is borne of a woman is of a short continuance,
                  Iob 14. 1. 
                  and full of trouble. And if it be common to all, without exception of any (how great how godly soeuer) thou shouldst be too delicate to desire to be exempted.
               Secondly, in a more neare manner, it is common to all the Saints of God to haue troubles in this world, more then the wicked, by reason of the enmity

that the wicked world beareth to the godly, being vnto them a step-mother, while like a naturall mother, she affordeth all the delight she can vnto her own. The Apostle Paul saith, All that will liue godly in Christ Iesus, shall suffer persecution.
                  2. Tim. 3. 1
                        •…
                     . And if it be common to all Christs followers to beare a crosse and follow him, thou must not looke to be free.
               Thirdly, thy troubles, if they should continue vnto the last hower of thy life, yet are they but short, for life it selfe is short, & no trouble, but is shorter. They end and giue place one to another, and God interposeth between trouble and trouble spaces of quiet and gladnesse, and they are mixed with much cause of reioycing, not only in regard of future mercies hoped for, but also in regard of present mercies possessed. Which mixture is as good and pleasant, as the ending of troubles: and therefore they are to be esteemed short: as also the Apostle calleth them, saying, Our light affliction which is but for a seasō, and he that shrinketh for short troubles, is but fainthearted.
               
                  Fourthly, thou hast Christ ioyning his shoulder to thine, and bearing part with the in euery burden of thine, and he beareth both in compassion to pity thee, and also in his diuine power to assist thee, that thou maiest not sinke vnder thy burden. Therefore doth he call thy yoke his yoke, saying, Take my yoke on
                  Matth. 11.

                     9. 
                  you. Therefore when he speaketh of the vnkindnesse shewed to his followers, he speakes on this manner, I was hungry

                        •…
                     
                   
                  and yee gaue me meat, I was thirsty and yee gaue me drinke. And speaking to Saul, then perscuting those that called vpon his name, he said vnto him; Saul, Saul,
                  Acts. 9. 4. 
                  why persecutest thou me? Thus he maketh himselfe a party in all the sufferings of his seruants: & what Christian man shall grudge to beare his part in that burden, wherein he hath the Lord Iesus so kindly and so strongly bearing with him.
               Fistly, let him consider that those troubles that disquiet his life, were not raised vp against him without Gods appointment: as Dauid said of Sheme
                        •…
                     , Suffer
                  2. Sam. 16. 11. 
                  him to curse, for the Lord hath bidden him. And if thou diddest grue to receiue or disdaine to put vp the offered wrong

at the hands of the offerer, yet receiue them without griefe, and put them vp without disdaine at the hands of God, and for his pleasure sake.
               Lastly, let him consider that troubles auile much to the practise of Christianity, they make vs remember God more often, and pray to him more feruently then otherwise we would. They make vs remember our selues that wee are but dust, and haue offended God: they pull downe pride, and prouoke vnto repence: they worke in vs bowels of compassion, causing vs to pity others in trouble: they make vs lesse to loue this present world, and more to desire and long for heauen. These considerations put together, are of great power to make any Christian man to beare them patiently, and to esteeme them no burden, though God in his wisedome suffer them to lie long vpon vs. The rules hitherto deliuered, teach kindly how to cast our burden of domesticall troubles vpon God. When our trouble is caused by the wrong offered vnto vs by others, in their vnthankfulnesse, disobedience, vniustice, or frowardnesse.

               First if sicknesse, feare of death, or anyIf griefe grow from sicknesse in thy selfe. other calamity be happened to thy selfe, patience and praier, commended before for common rules in all troubles, are here to be vsed. And if it be sicknesse in thine owne body, these things obserued will giue ease to thy minde, and perhaps health also to thy body; and so either remoue wholy thy burden, o
                     •…
                   make it more easie. First remember that it is the visitation of God, euen of himDeut. 32. 39. that saith of himself, I wound, and I make
                  
                  whole, that is, I send painefull sicknesse▪ and again▪ I send sauing health. This rule will lead thee into many other, wherof euery one will greatly helpe thine ease. It will teach thee, as the Apostle Peter also teacheth thee, when he saith: Humble
                  1. Pet. 5. 6. 
                  your selues vnder the mighty hand of God, that hee may exalt you in due time. For it wil make thee patiently to yeelde to the Lords pleasure. Secondly, it will make thee looke into thy life past, and to acknowledge thy sinne prouoking God, as it moued Dauid, saying, Thine
                  Psal. 32. 4. 
                  hand is heauy vpon mee day and night, and my moisture is turned into the drought of Summer, then I acknowledged my sinne vnto thee: for I thought I will confesse against my selfe my wickednesse vnto the Lord, and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne. And thirdly, with a resolution to depart from thy former iniquity, it wil mooue thee to pray vnto God for health, and to vow praise and thankes vnto God, as the sicknesse of Hezekiah
                  Esa. 38 2. wrought zeale of praier and thanksgiuing in him; Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and praied vnto the Lord, and said, I beseech thee, Lord, remember
                  
                  now how I haue walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and haue done that which is good in thy sight. And for his resolution of praising God, it followeth in the same place; The graue
                  Esa▪ 38. 18. 
                  cannot confesse thee, death cannot praise thee, they that goe downe into the pit cannot hope for thy truth, but the liuing, the liuing, hee shall confesse thee, as I doe this day: the father to the children shal declare thy truth. The Lord was ready to saue mee, therefore we will sing my song, all the daies of our life, in the house of the Lord. The first acknowledgement of Gods hand, will produce all these things following, as patience, confession of sinnes, praier, and vowes of thanksgiuing: and euery of these at the hands of God, wil obtain ease of thy griefe. Then lastly, it will mooue thee in all the meanes thou vsest for the recouery of helth, to looke higher then either to the skill of the Physitian, or vertue of the medicine, that thou maist not fall into the mischiefe of Asa
                  2. Chro. 16. 12. King of Iuda, of whom it is written; Asa in the nine and thirtieth yeare of his raigne, was diseased in his feete, and his disease was extreame: yet hee sought not the
                  
                  Lord in his disease, but to the Physitians. So Asa slept with his fathers, and died. Thus auaileable to the easing of thy burden of sicknesse in thy selfe, it will be, to acknowledge therein the visitation of God.
               And if it be any other calamity ofIf it be any other calamity. whatsoeuer kinde fallen vpon vs, (and diuers they are that may fall vpon vs: as for example, Ioseph was sould vnto strangers, and imprisoned in Aegypt: the men of Zeklag were spoiled of all that they had, in their absence with Dauid: Abiathar of the house of Eli, was cast out by Salomon from being Priest vnto the Lord: warre and famine, and the anger of Princes, yea many inferior causes, breed many calamities) the only sure way of casting our burden vpon God, is to acknowledge the worke of God in our calamity, patiently to beare what he laieth vpon vs, and heartily to pray vnto him for succour. That wee ought to acknowledge Gods worke in our calamity, and patiently to beare his pleasure, Iob doth teach vs saying, Shall
                  Iob▪ 2. 10▪
                   
                  we receiue good things at the hand of God, and not receiue euill? Surely we doe neuer

deserue any good at the hand of God, and wee doe continually deserue euill: what reason then haue we to desire euer to receiue good that we neuer deserue: and neuer to receiue euill that we euer deserue? Patience therefore in bearing the calamity that God laieth vpon vs, doth well become the sonnes of men. And that in our calamity wee ought to pray vnto God, if wee would haue him to ease vs of our burden, is so cleare, that wee neede no proofe for it. What man is hee, religious or profane, beleuer or vnbeleuer, that doth not in his calamity remember God, looke vp to heauen, and pray to God? the Mariners in the ship, whereinto Ionas was entered, when he fled from God, when the storme vpon the sea was sore, and the tempest proued a calamity vnto them, so that they threw the wares out of the ship into the sea, to lighten the ship, for safty of their liues, without instruction they could then, according to their knowledge of God, fall to praier. For so it is written; The Mariners were
                  Ion. 1. 5. 
                  affraid, and cried euery man vnto his God. Though it be not generall with all men,

being in calamity and misery, to beare it patiently, yet it is generall with all men in calamity and misery to pray for ease. So that a religious man, being burdened with any calamity, needeth not so much to be taught, that it is fit for him to pray, as hee needeth to be comforted, by being put in hope, that God will in due time answer his praier: as surely he will, if he be called vpon in the name of his beloued sonne. For so hath the Lord Iesus assured vs, saying.Iob. 16. 23. 
                  Verely, verely I say vnto you, whatsoeuer yee shall aske the father in my name, he will giue it you. Let him pray therefore vnto God the father in the name of the Lord Iesus, and patiently attend the Lords leisure, and in due time he wil haue mercy vpon him. This is when any calamity is fallen vpon vs, to cast our burden vpon the Lord, for our ease.
               If it be the feare of death, that is thyIf it be feare of death. burden: and perhaps with regard vnto others that shall be in some danger by thy death, as wife, children, seruants, and others that haue their education and maintenance vnder thee. First the burden of feare of death, is made easie to a

godly man by many considerations, in al which he cas
                     •…
                  eth his burden vpon the Lord. First hee will consider that it is common to all Adams posteritie. A
                     •…
                   
                  Dauid being ready to die saith vnto his sonne Salomon; I goe the way of all the
                  1. King. 2. 2 
                  earth: therefore death ought not to seeme fearefull to thee, that is common to all. Secondly, hee will consider that hee cannot die before the time appoynted of God, that gaue him life, and assigned from euerlasting the certaine length of it; as Iob saith, Is there not an appoynted
                  Iob 7. 1. 
                  time to man vppon earth? And shall any desire longer life, then the giuer of life alloweth▪ Or shall any be grieued to resigne his life into the handes of him that gaue it? Thirdly, hee will consider that the end of life shall bee the end of trouble vnto him, & that his death shall bring him rest from all troubles, as the Spirit of God from heauen hath proclaimed, saying, 'Blessed are the dead that die
                  Reu. 14. 13 
                  in the Lord, for they rest from their labor. Rest and ease from weary labour, is obtained by our death and departure out of this life. Fourthly, hee will consider that the sting and danger, and all bitternesse

of death is taken away by the death of Iesus Christ, and death vnto the Saints is made the gate of life: the Apostle saying; O death where is thy sting? O graue
                  1. Corin. 15 55. 
                  where is thy victorie? The sting of death is sinne, and the strength of sinne is the law. But thankes be vnto God, which hath giuen vs victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ. Lastly, for his ease, of feare in the approach of death, yea for the filling of his heart with all true comfort in death, that he may rather desire and long for, then any way feare the houre of his death, he will consider, that his death shal be the gathering of him vnto Christ his redeemer: as the Apostle saith, Desiring
                  Phil. 1. 23. 
                  to bee loosed, and to bee with Christ, which is best of all. For while we liue in the world, we are absent from the Lord, and we walke by faith and not by sight. But when we depart this world, wee are gathered vnto him to dwel for euer with him. And that is performed which hee promised, saying, Though I goe to prepare
                  Iohn 14▪ 3. 
                  a place for you, I will come againe, aud receiue you vnto my selfe, that where I am, there may ye be also. By these considerations is the burden of the feare of death

made easie to a beleeuer: and in all these considerations doth hee cast his burden vpon the Lord for his ease.
               If hee therefore feare his owne death, because others shall want him: his wife shal be a widow, his children shalbe fatherlesse, his seruants shalbe orphanes, and many shall misse him, that now haue a helper of him; and for their sakes, rather then for himselfe, hee is afraid to die. This burthen is to bee cast vppon God, by commending them vnto his prouidence, who giueth food to al flesh, because his mercy indureth for euer: and who is the keeper of Israel, that neither slumbereth nor sleepeth.

Hence commeth the feeding of the hungry, the refreshing of the thirstie, the clothing of the naked, the intertaining of the stranger, the visiting of the sicke, and releeuing men in bonds. Hence grow all these works of mercy, namely, that men and women of tender hearts, which haue bowels of compassion in their bodies, are grieued to behold the want, the miseries, and calamities of others, and doe ease their owne hearts, by vsing all meanes to ease the others calamity: so casting in a most sweete maner the burden of their owne griefe vppon God, who will certainely comfort them that labor to comfort his afflicted ones, Vnto this rule pertaine all the precepts of ministring to the necessities of the Saints.

And herein wee haue Dauid an example of godly fortitude vnto vs, who hauing a childe sicke, did while it yet liued, afflict his soule. For it is written, Dauid be sought GOD for the
                  2. Sa. 12. 16 
                  childe, and fasted, and went in, and lay all night vpon the earth. Then the Elders of his house arose, to come vnto him, and to cause him to rise from the ground, but hee would not, neither did hee eate meate with them. Thus while there was hope of remedy, he gaue way to the sorrow of his2. Sa. 12. 18 heart. But it followeth; On the seuenth day the child died: and the seruants of Dauid feared to tell him, that the childe was
                  
                  dead: for they said, behold while the child was yet aliue, we spake vnto him, and hee would not bearken vnto our voyce: how shall wee say vnto him, the childe is dead, to vex him more? But when Dauid saw his seruants whispered, Dauid perceiued that the childe was dead: Therefore Dauid said vnto his seruants, Is the childe dead? And they said, hee is dead: then Dauid arose from the earth, and washed, and annoynted himselfe, and changed his apparell, and came into the house of the Lord, and worshipped, and after came to his owne house, and bade that they should set bread before him, and hee did eat. His sorrowing ended when hee once sawe, that there was no hope of enioying any longer the company of his childe. Now this course seemed to his seruants a new and strange kind of philosophie, that he should mourne in the danger of death, and yet reioyce, or at least comfort himselfe with any content in death: and therefore his seruants saide vnto him, What thing is this that thou hast done?
                  2. Sa. 12. 21 
                  thou diddest fast and weepe for the childe while it was aliue: but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eate meat. And

what reason had hee for this strange and vnwonted behauiour? Hee said, while
                  2. Sa. 12. 22 
                  the childe was yet aliue, I fasted and wept: for I said, who can tell whether God will haue mercy on me, that the child may liue: but now being dead, wherefore shall I now fast? can I bring him againe any more? I shall goe to him, but he shall not returne to me. Behold, the same thing that maketh thee to mourne, namely, that thy dead shall not returne to thee: the same consideration Dauid made the ground of his quiet and content, and thereupon he comforted his heart, and would not continue in heauines for that that could not be helped. So that it is (to a right vnderstanding man) ground enough to build content and quietnesse of heart vpon, that God hath done his worke, which thy sorrow cannot reuoke.
               But, for the further quieting of thy minde, know that thy dead shall liue againe: as the Prophet Esay saith▪ 
                  Thy
                  Esa. 26. 19 
                  deadmen shall liue, with my body shall they rise. There is a day appointed of GOD, wherin they shall returne out of the dust againe, and liue againe in their bodies then glorified. Yea, know that for thy

comfort, that thy dead doe now liue, and howsoeuer their bodies lie without life in the graue, yet their soules do liue, and shall liue for euer with God. And with these considerations of the present life of the soule, and the future life of the bodies, the Apostle would haue wise Christians comfort thēselues ouer their dead, and not giue way to their affections, to mourne without measure, saying,1. thes. 4▪ 13 
                  I would not brethren haue you ignorant concerning them which are asleepe, that ye sorrow not as others which haue no hope. For if wee beleeue that Iesus is dead and risen, euen so them which sleepe in Iesus, God shall bring with him. For this say wee vnto you by the word of the Lord, that wee which liue, and are remayning in the comming of the Lord, shall not preuent them which sleepe. For the Lord himselfe shall descend from heauen with a showt, and with the voyce of the Archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then shal we which liue and remaine, be caught vp with them in the clouds▪ to meet the Lord in the aire, and so shall wee euer bee with the Lord. Wherefore comfort your selues one another
                  
                  with these words. Let them mourne for their dead, that know not the hope of the dead, and suppose them extinct that are departed: but let them which in the schoole of Christ, haue learned what is the condition and hope of the dead, how their soules doe presently liue with Christ, and that their bodies also shalbe raised vp in glorie at the last day. Let them reioyce in the behalf of their dead, and throw off that burden of sorrow, which is so heauy vnto them. And thus much for the second branch of secular troubles, namely, for domesticall troubles, and the casting of that burden vpon God.

And those, for whom thou art grieued, are not of the same house, stocke, village, or country with thee: yet because they are men, and haue fellowship with thee in common nature, or because they are christians, and haue fellowship with thee in the same common religiō, thy hart is grieued by way of compassion, to heare of the calamities that are hapned vnto them.

                     ce are also very sitting for these: first therfore arme thy selfe with patience, & & quietly suffer till God send ease. And for the confirming of thy patience, consider that the harts of all mē being in the hands of God, these should neuer haue had any will to offer the wrong, if God

for some holy cause had not stirred them vp, as he is said to haue stirred vp troublers to Salomon, when he fell to idolatry:1. Ki. 11. 14 
                  Then the Lord stirred vp an aduersary vnto Salomon, euen Hadad the Edomite, &c. And therefore though thou grudge to beare at the hands of men, yet beare with patience and humility the good pleasure of God, who knoweth when and how to make thee amends. Dauid with this consideration confirmeth himselfe in his patience, saying I should haue
                  Psal. 39. 6. 
                  bin dumbe and not haue opened my mouth, because thou didst it. Saint Ierome reades it, I haue been dumbe, and will not open my mouth. Tremellius reades it, I am dumbe, and doe not open my mouth. The meaning is, that either he should haue kept silence, or he had kept silence, or he did keep silence, or was resolued hereafter to keep silence: or else altogether, for time past, present, and to come, he held himselfe bound as by way of duty, in his trouble to be mute and dumbe, from murmuring, raging, and all works of impatiencie, vpon this only reason, because thou didst it, that is, because he knew it to be the handy worke of God.
               
                  And vnto patience adde praier: forAnd

For by silence from murmuring, it is manifest, that God is feared, and his pleasure approued: but by silence from praier, it is manifest, that God is neglected, and his helpe little set by▪ In these troubles therefore, and in all troubles, it is a principall point of casting our burden vpon God, to seeke his helpe by praier. And the same consideration of Gods deed (in stirring vp the aduersary that serueth to shut our mouthes against words of murmuring, serueth as strongly to open our mouthes for words of humble praier. That childe, that bearing the fathers displeasure, & in the fathers displeasure suffering want of some wonted case, doth refuse to make request vnto his father, for the withdrawing of his displeasure, and the restoring of wonted liberty (especially being by the father commanded to make request, and assured by his fathers promise that when he

doth make request all shal be forgiuen) that childe plainly appeareth to beare too big a heart against his father. And a wise father (not willing to be contemned of his child) wil not restore his child to his wonted grace and liberty, till he humble himselfe, and intreat his father. Euen so that christian man that hath displeased God (and who hath not iustly deserued his displeasure) and feeleth vpon him the hand of his displeased God, in troubles, that these remote enemies (stirred vp of God) doe put him vnto, and doth not humble himselfe, and pray vnto God for his fauour, and ease (seeing God hath both commanded him to pray, and hath also promised to heare him, & helpe him when he praieth) that man shews a heart ouer swolne against his God, and God in iustice can doe no lesse then denie to send him reliefe, so long as he refuseth to intreate for reliefe. This therefore is a speciall point of casting our burden vpon God, in these and in all troubles, that men do learne to make humble praier vnto God.

               Some bend their malice against thy life: and either vow and attempt themselues to kill thee, as Ioab did Abner: or

hire and sot on others to murther thee, as Absolom set on his seruants to murther Amnon: or accuse thee to men of more fury & violence then themselues, betraying thee into their hands, to bee sacrificed to their wrath: or stirre vp and arme by false accusations the Magistrate against thee, that vnder shew of iustice thou maiest be vniustly ouerthrowne. Let vs see how the burden of these troubles is to bee cast vppon God.
               Consider heere first of all whence theIf thou gauest the occasion. occasion grew; and if thou findest thy troubles prouoked by any priuate error of thine, seek to satisfie them whom thou diddest wrong, and be not of the stomacke of them that will maintaine what they haue done, be it neuer so iniurious, and acknowledge thy fault, make reasonable amends, seeke reconciliation, and by all meanes assure vnto them thy resolution to abstaine from offering like wrongs any more. Shemei, though none of the honestest, nor wisest men, yet when hee considered that his wrong done to Dauid might breede him that enmity that might become a

burden, heauie and daungerous to his peace & life; for his ease & safty his wit serued him to confesse his fault, to seek peace submissiuely, and to offer better seruice for the time to come: when Dauid after the ouerthrow of Absolom, came backe ouer Iordan to returne to Ierusalem, Shemei came with haste to

Therefore behold, I am the first this day of all the house of Ioseph that am come to goe downe to meete my Lord the King. And this submission of his, confessing his fault, and crauing pardon, preuayled with Dauid, so that hee did not let his wrath fall, as a heauie burden vppon the necke of Shemei, though there were some men present that did much prouoke Dauid to reuenge.
               But if thou be free, hauing giuen them

no occasion, and onely sufferest wrong,If thou giue not the occasion. the fault being wholly in thine enemie: I tell thee, this very testimonie of thy conscience is a great easing of thy burden, if thou suffer not for thy sinne, but for their malice. So did the Lord Iesus suffer among the Priests and Pharisies. The greater half of the burden is by this meanes turned off, when peace of conscience abideth with thee: other griefs and wrongs may be the more easily indured. Salomon saith in the Prouerbs, A
                  Pro. 15. 15 
                  good conscience is a perpetuall feast. This is no small pleasure to a good man, that hath beene vrged and vexed with vnkindnesse abroad, that when hee commeth home, hee entreth into his closet, and examineth his heart, and findeth that hee is in no fault, and can plead his innocencie before God: it is a feast to him: he sitteth downe boldly and cheerfully by the mercie-seate of God, and despiseth with a godly scorne, both the wrong done, and the wrong doer, saying in his heart, by the mercie of God, this wrong shall turne to my good, and this wrong doer shall not preuaile against mee: and with great confidence

of heart he powreth out his desires before God. Saint Peter hath a saying that agreeth well with this point; that wee haue now in hand; Let none of you suffer
                  1 Pet. 4. 15 
                  as a murderer, or as a thiefe, or as a busiebody in other mens matters, but if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not bee ashamed, but let him glorifie God in this behalfe. Heere is right thy case: hauing examined thine heart, thou findest tha

This innocencie of thine maketh thy burden to be much lighter.
               And if God haue purposed to shortenIf God will reforme the troubler. thy trouble by conuersion of thine enemie, though thou haue not such opportunitie to helpe him with wholesome councell, beeing a remote enemy, as thou hast to helpe a domesticall: yet as opportunitie is offered, remember and practise that precept of the Lord Iesus,
                  Mat 18▪ 15
                  
                  go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone. And otherwise let it be the wish of thine heart, and pray to God for it, that God will be pleased to giue him a better heart. Some haue obserued, that Saint Stephens prayer helped much the conuersion of Saul (after called Paul) beeing one of those remote troublers to him, & a very furious one. When Stephen that blessed Martire of Iesus Christ was put to death, Saul was a busie doer against him. The witnesses
                  Acts 7. 58. (to whome it belonged to throw the first stone at the condemned person) laied downe their cloathes at a yong mans
                  Acts 8. 1. 
                  feete whose name was Saul. And Saul consented to his death, and otherwise made hauocke of the church, and breathed threatnings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord. It pleased the Lord Iesus in his wonderfull mercy to meete this persecuter in the heat of his fury, neere to the Citie of Damascus, and to conuert him, and to make him a disciple.
               And the effect of that conuersion was peace to the Church, that had beene oppressed before with a heauie burden

of troubles by means of that troubler. As it is written, Then had the Churches
                  Acts 9. 31. 
                  rest through all Iudea, and Galile, and Samaria, and were edified, and walked in the feare of the Lord, and were multiplied by the comfort of the holy Ghost. And this conuersion of Saul, with the churches peace growing thereby, some haue ascribed vnto Stephens prayer, as an intermediate cause, who while they stoned him, kneeled downe, and cryed with
                  Acts 7. 60. 
                  a lowd voyce, Lord, lay not this sinne to their charge. Of which prayer of Stephen, Austin in his fourth Sermon of the Saints hath this saying▪ 
                  If Stephen
                  Aug. Ser. 4. de Sanctis. 
                  had not thus prayed, the Church should not haue had Paul: but therfore was Paul (being fallen from his horse) raised from the earth, because when Stephen, with bowed knees was fallen to the ground, hee was heard in his prayer. Therfore thogh thou hast not oportunitie to admonish thy remote aduersary, yet pray vnto God for his conuersion. Thou knowest not whether God wil heare thy praier, and shorten thy trouble, by changing the mind of thy troubler.
               If it be to bewrought by a remoue▪
                  
and that remoue to be made by death,If God will remoue by death. therein thou hast nothing to do beforehand, but to maintaine that resolution that alwaies ought to be in all Christians, namely, to yeeld to the wil of God, and to approue his worke, as well in killing as in giuing life, and as well in our selues as in others. And if it please God to take away thine enemy, then is it thy part to praise his name, that suffereth thy peace to out-liue thine enemies fury: but neither worke it, nor desire it, nor reioyce in it as a calamity happened to thine enemy, or to his house: much lesse offer violence to thy self, that may free thee from short troubles, but it will surely plunge thee into eternall troubles.

passage, rather then to stay him with any impediment. And it is at thy liberty, flying from the swords point of persecution and malice, to remooue from one City to another.
               But if God be pleased to maintaine againstIf God will continue thy trouble. thee, the enemy that he hath stirred vp; thy chiefe casting of thy burden vpon God, is by patience to possesse thy soule, bearing quietly what thou canst not shake off: & by hearty praier to sollicite the maiesty of the most high God, to free thee from thine enemy when it pleaseth him, and in the meane time to giue thee wisdome to suffer as thou oughtest, to his pleasure. Thus much how to cast the burden of remote troubles vpon God, when thy troble groweth from the malice of remote enemies that offer wrong vnto thee.
               Sometimes thou art not hurt by remoteIf thy trouble be griefe

such calamity: sometime in regard of common holy religion, because they worship the same God, and beleeue in the same Sauiour, that thou doest; and it greueth thee, that any of thy faith and religion, and any true worshipper of thy God should indure such misery.
               For direction to cast this burden vponNot usuall to be grieued for others. God, there needeth no long discourse, because I feare there are not many, that beare any such burden of sorrow for others misery, or vpon whom it lieth heauy if they sorrow at all, or vpon whom it abideth long if it be heauy. Selfloue permitteth vs not to mourne for the calamity of other men, when we are at case our selues. The Butler in Pharaoes court, when hee had once recouered his owne place and honour, neuer regarded, nor was moued with Iosephs imprisonment. The chiefe Butlar did not remember Ioseph,

                  but forgat him. And those wounds neuer enter deepe in our hearts, which we only see or heare in others, and feele not in our selues: and the teares that fall from our eies for other mens miseries, quickly drie vp. If Amos liued in this selfe-delighting and neighbour contemning

age, wanton and excessiue one way, but wanting and pitilesse another way, he would surely crie out againe, as before he did, saying, They drinke wine
                  Amos 6. 6. 
                  in bowles, and annoint themselues with the chiefe ointments, but no man is sorry for the afflictions of Ioseph: that is, euery man cherisheth himselfe delicately, but no man regardeth how other men fare.

First, so farre as distance of place betweene thee and them, the small acquaintance that thou hast with them, and thy weake means will suffer, afford them thy best helpe. Egypt afforded food to Canaan, when famine was sort in that land. The King of Moab gaue entertainment to Dauids father, and to his whole houshold, when Sauls displesure

was heauy to them in Israel. Dauid had Ziklag giuen him to dwell in, when he could not be safe in Iuda. Mercy by hospitality succoureth many strangers, that by famine, warre, and other calamities cannot remain in safety at home. If thou be grieued for the calamity of them that dwell farre off, affourd thy best helpe: thou shalt make lesse thy sorrow for their calamity, while thou makest lesse their calamity by thy mercy. Therefore did the brethren among the belieuing Gentiles, make collections to send to the poore Saints at Ierusalem. Secondly, vse patience in this case: and till God put an end to their miseries, glorifie thou God in his iudgments, that so exerciseth truth, humbleth, correcteth, and punisheth. Lastly, pray vnto God for them, that in his iudgements he will be pleased to remember mercy; and to spare the sheepe of his owne pasture, if they be true worshippers: or at least that he will spare the worke of his owne hands, whatsoeuer they be, and forgiuing their sinnes, that he will giue them repentance, that they may come to the knowledge of him and of his

truth, and in the end be deliuered from his fiery wrath. In these three things, i

And so haue wee considered of this third secular burden of more remote troubles, which hath great affinity with the burden of more nigh and domesticall troubles and differeth onely in respect of the persons, by whom thou art wronged, and for whom thou art grieued, in that they are further from thee.

                  THE fourth and last branch ofThe fourth secular burden, difficulties of our callings. our secular burdens, is the burden of difficulties that follow the duties of our callings. The callings themselues, whether superiour or inferiour, whether in a priuate house, or in an ample Citie, in the whole kingdome, or in the Church of God are the ordinances of God, as Paul saith of the magistrate; The powers that bee, are
                  Rom. 13. 1.
                  
                  ordained of God; and as might be shewed for all other callings from the highest to the lowest. Therefore they are honorable, and in them we serue the Lord, as so many officers in his house. And the offices that we are tied to performe by the nature & condition of our callings, they are inioyned vnto vs (to euery calling distinctly) by God himselfe in his word, wherein is set downe, what the King, the Iudge, and euery Maiestrate, what the Minister, the husband, the wife, the father, the childe, the Maister and seruant, must doe; and therefore those officers are holy. The ends of them are, the glory of God, the peace of the kingdome, the edification of the Church, and the prosperitie & good of euery priuate person: and therefore it is honorable to vs to be imployed in those callings and to performe those good offices; for in those callings and offices, we serue God (whose seruice is perfect freedome) while others, neglecting to serue in these callings, and to performe these offices, serue their owne lustes, the world, and the Diuell, to their dishonour. Yet those offices so holy and so honorable, by reason

of certaine difficulties that accompany and follow them, doe bring a heauie burden of troubles vpon vs.
               Sometime wee are vnsufficient forIf we be insufficient those callings, and vnable to performe those offices. And that happeneth either by our own fault, or by the fault of some others. By our owne fault, either in our entrance, ambitiously or couetously thrusting into callings (for the honor and fee of them) that we were neuer fit for: or after our entrance, losing our gifts through sloth and idlenes, and so growing vnsufficient, as an instrument that is become rustie for want of vse. By the fault of others, when they which had power to call and admit vnto any place, & perhaps authoritie to impose, hauing a go

                   duties of our callings proue a heauie burden vnto vs.
               Sometime wee are sufficient for theIf we be sufficient, but are crossed. seruice that our callings bind vs vnto, and we vse faithfull diligence; but some

froward men oppose against vs, as Elimas the sorcerer with-stood the preaching of Paul. By meanes of which opposition, & crosse working of those men, it commeth to passe, that either thou canst not bring to prosperous issue the good things that thou labourest in, or thou effectest them with much more labour. This maketh the seruices of thy calling to be much more heauie vnto thee.If we doe well and be misconstrued.
               
               Sometime thou art sufficient, and art diligent, and hast effected things happily to thy minde: but then enuious men misconstrue, mistake wittingly, and misreport thy doings, as the Scribes and Pharises mistake and mis-reported the holy and most absolute workes of the Lord Iesus. And then insteed of loue and commendation, which thou didst looke for, thou art blamed; and insteede of reward and incouragement, which thou didst deserue, thou art in danger to be punished: this proues a great burden. In all these cases, yee see how heauie burdens grow from honorable and honest callings, besides the continuall care that euery good man hath to doe his dutie in his place. Let vs see how

we may cast these burdens vpon God to be eased.

Such are many antient men, that hauing plentie of wealth, and p

And such are young gentlemen, brought vp in idle pleasures, that being younger brethren, for their better maintenance, make suite to haue the charge and leading of companies for the war, & would be Captaines the first day, hauing neuer yet beene good souldiers; they knowe how to behaue themselues in the house

and among friends, but they know not how to behaue themselues in the field and against enimies. And such are many ignorant and slothfull men, that seeke to be admitted into the ministrie, and to get a good benefice, that they may liue easily, and eate the milke of the flocke, hauing no abilitie to seede the flocke, yea no care thereof. These men, when they are called and vrged to the seruices of their places, then begins their burden to waie heauie, and their insufficiencie makes them subiect to danger and disgrace. How shall these men cast their burden vpon God, for their ease?

and God will second thy desire and trauaile with his blessing. The twelue, when they were first called, and admitted of the Lord Iesus, were not so fit for their places; as afterward they proued. I speake not these things to imbolden any man to thrust into

Let them vse good meanes, and make triall of Gods mercie. It hath fallen out, that men very raw at their first entring, by diligence after vsed, haue growne very fit, while others, of good fitnes at their entring, by negligence and idlenes haue lost their giftes, and become very vnprofitable.

                  garment (that is the robe of the Prophets profession that he was vnfit for) and he should say I am no Prophet, I am an husband man▪ for man taught me to be an heardman from my youth. That is, I was neuer brought vp and fitted for the seruice of a Prophet, where into I did foolishly thrust my selfe, and therefore I will leaue that calling vnto more sufficient men: and whereas I was brought vp to the trade of a husband-man & heard-man, I will henceforth follow that calling, that I may eate my bread with a good conscience, & with Gods blessing, though my reputation and maintenance be lesse. This is to cast thy burden vpon God.
               If thy ambition and couetousnes did

not make thee intrude, but men hadIf we be not insufficient by our own faults. good opinion of thy sufficiencie, as Pharao had of Iosephs wisdome, & thou hast vsed no cunning to draw them to haue such opinion of thee, but they simplie, out of their owne obseruation iudged well of thee, and imposed a charge vpon thee, not being yet so ripe in iudgemēt, and otherwise, as thou wouldest be, and hadst neede to bee: in this case there is a good calling of God, to giue thee hope of his further helpe, though as yet thou be but as Dauid was, the youngest among many brethren. And the testimonie of thine owne conscience, cle

Plead thine honest calling, plead thy cleere conscience before God, and craue his fauour: and if they that did chuse thee will not discharge thee, pray to God for increase of strength, & craue the helpe of their prayers, that laid the burden vpon thee, and bend thy selfe with good hope vnto thy busines. It is written, that out of the mouthes of babes
                  Psal. 8. 2. 
                  and sucklings, God ordaineth strength, hope well therefore, in thy diligent indeuour, of the assistance of God, and

remember what the Lord Iesus answered to Paul, my grace is sufficient for

I am able to doe all things, through the helpe of Christ that strengthneth me: and make vse of these testimonies, studying, striuing, praying, and vsing all meanes and helps for increase of sufficiencie.

And there is scarce any one good worke, that a man of publike calling can take in hand, but the Diuell hath one instrument or other to crosse

the attempt, and hinder the successe: so did the Sorcerers of Egypt withstand the message of Moses and Aaron, comming vnto Pharao in the name of the Lord. So did Rehum and Simshai, with their companions with Tatuai, and Sauballat and T

When Elias had slaine the Priestes of Baal, and sought to bring backe Israel to the worship of the Lord, Iesabel opposed hi
                     •…
                   selfe, and made Elias to flie for his life. And while the Apostles preached the Gospell of Christ to the Gentiles, the vnbeleeuing Iewes stirring vp the Gentiles, withstood them in all places: as the Apostle chargeth them saying, They haue persecuted vs, and God,
                  1. Thes. 2. 15. 
                  they please not, and are contrarie to all men, and forbid vs to preach vnto the Gentiles, that they might be saued. Thus vsually, through Sathans enuie, it falleth out, that scarce any attempteth any commendable worke, but that one or other instrument of Sathan ariseth, opposing himselfe against it, to hinder the performance

of it, increasing his burden that trauelleth about it. How shall men thus vexed, cast their burden vpon the Lord?
               First, when thou seest their mallice and opposition, be not driuen from thy patience and peaceable minde, lest thou also shouldest either say or doe amisse in thy vnquiet passion. Secondly, vnto this patience ioyne prayer vnto God, and in thy prayer craue these things of God. First, that God will oppose his helpe against their opposition, and hinder their hindring attempts, as the Prophet doeth saying. Let not the wicked haue his desire
                  Psal 140. 
                        •…
                     . 
                  O Lord, performe not his wicked thoughts. Secondly craue the assistance of Gods hand vpon thy labour, & good indeuor, to helpe thee against thine opposites; as the Prophet doeth, saying, Giue vs helpe
                  Psal. 108. 12. 
                  against trouble, for vaine is the helpe of man, through God we shall doe valiantly. Lastly that he will take thy good enterprise into his hand, and vse thee as his instrument to effect so good a worke by; as also the Prophet doth, saying, Let
                  Psal. 90. 17.

                  euen direct the worke of our handes. Surely in this case, this is to cast our burden vpon God: if withall, when we see the end to fall out contrarie to our godly purpose, we glorifie God therein, supposing, that as God would not let Dauid build his Temple, but reserued it to be performed afterward by Salomon: so God for some secret cause will not haue that good worke finished by thee, but res

                  Amos hath conspired against thee, in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to beare all his words. So seeking, betray his life into the handes of cruelty vnder shewes of iustice.
               Then the casting of our burden vpon

God is first, in his name to protest ou
                     •…
                   innocencie, and that we haue done our dutie with an honest heart as God commaunded vs. So did Amos after Amaziah had accused him, saying for himselfe, The Lord tooke me as I followed the
                  Amos. 7. 15. 
                  stocke, and said vnto me, Goe, prophecie to my people Israel. That is, I haue in those sermons which you call Conspiracie, faithfully followed the commandement of the God of Israel. So also did Ieremy, when the Priestes and false Prophets, and the multitude of the people had laid hands vpon him in the Temple, and went about to kill him for his preaching, he protested his innocencie saying. The Lord hath sent me to prophecie against
                  Iere. 26. 12 
                  this house & against this Citie, all the things that you haue heard. And thine innocency being thus protested & made knowne, then secondly turne thee vnto God, appeale to his iudgemē
                  
                     •…

therefore taking no discomfort at the vniustice and vnthankfulnes of men, pray God to iustifie thy well doing against misreporters. Thou hast a promise of such mercie, made by the Prophet,Psal. 37▪ 6. saying, He shall bring forth thy righteousnes as the light, and thy iudgement as the noone day: and pray him to remember thee, and giue thee thy reward in heauen, because on earth good seruices are not worthily valowed: and in expectation of that reward at Gods hands, comfort thy soule in this case. And thus haue we spoken of the fower secular burdens, wherein immediately we haue to doe with men, in matters concerning this life, and shewed how the burdens may be, & ought to be cast vpon God for the

And in regard hereof, those troubles I call spirituall troubles. And those I reduce to two heads.

The multitude of our corruptions and the law of sinne in our members, so potent and strong, that we cannot doe the good we would (in doing whereof God should be serued) and the euil we would not, that we doe (by doing whereof the diuell is serued.)
               This is a grieuous burden to an honestGrieuous to the honest man. minded man, that is desirous to please God, and keepe a good conscience. Hee considereth who made him, and desireth to glorifie his creator. He considereth the manifold mercies of God towards him, and desireth to approue himselfe a thankfull man. He respecteth

And while he striueth to goe on in this course, nothing hindereth him more then the root of sin, that is deeply fastened in his owne flesh. The Diuell offereth a temptation, and his false flesh yeeldeth presently vnto it. The flattering world presenteth showes of vanity, and the flesh greedily imbraceth them. Occasions are offered and presented to our eies, and our traiterous flesh suddenly apprehendeth them; and our actions fall out to be sinfull and euill, sometime at vnawares, before wee haue leisure to consider what we ought to doe. Sometime against fore-fight: yea against repugning will. For that corruption that is in our flesh, (which

for the authority that it vsurpeth, and for the power that it exerciseth in vs, the Apostle calleth the law in our members)Rom. 7. 23 that corruption rebelleth against the law of our minde, and leadeth vs captiue into all actuall sinne. And wee are compelled in the campe of our enemies to serue against our beloued Lord. And this is no small griefe vnto a sanctified soule▪ that desireth to serue and worship God in spirit and truth. How heauy this burden is, the Apostles words doe teach vs, crying out, by reason of it, in this manner: O wretched man that I am,
                  Rom. 7 24. 
                  who shall deliuer mee from this body of death? It was vnto him more bitter then death, that sinne was of such power in his mortall body.

               Therefore for the case of such ouerchargedMatter of comfort for them. soules, to giue them some comfort, notwithstanding the continuance

of their burden, these things are to be considered. First, that where God hath giuen an heart grieued for these infirmities, he neuer imputeth vnto them the sinnes that they so vnwillingly, and grieuedly commit, their broken and displeased hearts being a pleasing sacrifice to him. According to the saying of thePsa. 51. 17▪
                   Prophet, The sacrifices of God are a contrite spirit, a contrite & a broken heart O God, thou wilt not despise. So that God taketh more pleasure, to see them sorrow for their committing sinne, then he doth displeasure for the sinne that they commit: for to commit sinne is common to all mankinde, and we cannot chuse but to doe amisse, while we liue in this flesh: but to mourne, and to be grieued for sin, to striue against it, and not to commit it, but with dislike & offence taken for it, is proper onely to them that truely loue the Lord.
               Secondly, though they cannot attaine vnto such perfect holinesse vppon earth as they desire, nor vnto such an absolute conquest ouer their corruptions, and such a full measure of mortification, that sin shal haue no life nor power

                  ng in them: yet their good wil, being true and vnfained, and their holy desire, beeing sound and not dissembled, is before God as well accepted, as if they were altogether without sinne. Therefore is it that God requireth the heart, saying, My sonne giue
                  Pro. 23▪ 26. 
                  me thine heart, and let thine eies delight in my wayes. He that can by the mercie of God attayne vnto this, to delight in in the wayes of God, and to haue a sound heart within his weake bodie, he hath attained vnto as great perfection of holinesse, as this present life is capable of, if that desire and delight of his be ioyned with knowledge and vnderstanding: so that hee be free from their errour, whom the Apostle speaketh of, saying; They being ignorant of the
                  Rom. 10. 3 
                  righteousnesse of God, and seeking to establish their owne righteousnes, haue not submitted themselues to the righteousnes of God. A single good intent without knowledge, is the deuotion of fooles, it hath no true comfort tied vnto it, it saueth not from destruction, it leadeth men blindefolde and sleeping into hell. But when men haue learned out of the

word of God, what hee requireth, and what is their duety, & vnto that knowledge ioyne a true desire to doe their duetie, then vnfained desire is before God esteemed a perfect worke. ThereforeRom. 13. 10. doth Saint Paul say, That loue is the fulfilling of the Law. And in another1. Tim. 1. 5. place. The end of the Law is loue out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and of faith vnfained. The Law requireth no more but loue, (which will neuer be idle;) and that obtained, the Law hath attained his true end in vs. And to him that thus loueth, as much is due, as vnto him that perfectly fulfilleth the commandement.
               Thirdly, to him that thus in heart desireth, while he liueth here, full perfect and absolute holinesse (being grieued, that the lusts of his flesh should stand vp in his way with such strength as they doe) that which hee desireth shall in due time be granted, with increase of grace in the meane while. For when death comes, in which hee pulleth off sinfull flesh, he shal put off sin & al corruption togither with the flesh, and thenceforth hee shall offend his God no more, nor

be in any danger of offending him For the Apostle truely saith, He that is dead
                  Rom. 6. 7. 
                  is freed from sinne, both from the act of sinne, and from all lusting after sinne. And when he shall receiue his bodie againe in the resurrection, hee shall receiue it cleansed and purged from that corruption that was in it before. For1. Corin 15 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   so doth Saint Paul testifie, saying; The body is sowne in corruption, and is raised in incorruption. By which incorruption he vnderstandeth, not onely an estate of strength and health, whereby it shall be freed from that decaying that it was subiect to before, in regard whereof we haue relieued it with daily food, to repaire the daily decaies: and also freed from sicknesse and paine that it suffred here before, in regard whereof wee take much physicke to ease the paine of it, and to maintaine the health of it: but he vnderstandeth rather by incorruption, an estate of purenesse & holinesse, whereby it shall bee freed from sinning and offending God, and shall stand and remaine for euer purged and cleansed from all sinfulnesse, and in as perfect sanctitie, as the blessed Angels

of God. And our true holinesse begunne heere, shall be consummated, and become perfect holinesse there.

                  iefe for them is not so much as it was. But let vs see further how a man may cast this burthen vpon God, to be eased of it, and get masterie ouer his lusts.
               For the casting of this burthen vponTo cast this burden vpon God, first study the Scriptures. God, these are good rules and profitable, seruing to procure case, and whereby strength against the corruptions and lusts of the flesh is obtained. First, let him be diligent in the study of the word of God, which Dauid calleth, A lanterne vnto our feete, and a light vnto
                  Psa. 119. 105
                  
                  our paths. Because in the spirituall darkenesse which ouershadoweth our souls in this world, so that of our selues wee cannot see nor finde out the paths of righteousnesse wherein wee should walke, if wee take vnto vs the word of God, it like a shining light, will reueale vnto vs the old way, which is the good way, that we may goe forward in it. It will teach vs what to doe, and what to leaue vndone, and will guide vs aright, against the dangerous seducings of our owne euill lusts
               And great force it hath to keep vs in our way, euen in those men, in whom their lusts and corruptions are most strong. As for example, in yong men, in whom there is more pride of wit, and more stubbornnesse of wil, then in men of other ages: in them, the word of God is powerfull, to make them aduised and to humble them. Dauid asketh this question▪ 
                  Wherewith all shall a yong
                  Psa. 119. 4▪
                   
                  man redresse his wayes? and hee giueth answer in the next words, saying, In taking heed there to according to Gods word. Such an excellent help, against the seducing lusts of the flesh, is the word of

God, for the redressing of our waies. So that if a man burdened with his corruptues, & desiring to obtain strength against them, doe giue himselfe to study the word of God, and do take heed vnto it, though he were as prowd witted, and as stubbornely wilfull, as were those yong men, the sonnes of Iacob, that cōmitted the outrage at Shechem, yet the word of God will bring downe his prowd wit, & reclaime the forward wils of the very dissolute gallants of the world.
               And this doth Dauid, being yet but a yong man, out of experience in himself affirme, saying, By thy commandements
                  Ps. 119. 98. 
                  thou hast made mee wiser then mine enemies, for they are euer with me: that is, I am a continuall student in thy commandements, I haue more vnderstanding then my teachers, for thy testimonies are my meditation: that is, my minde is alwayes vpon thy testimonies. I vnderstand more then the ancient, because I haue kept thy precepts: that is, age teacheth much by obseruation and experience, but Gods word teacheth more. So that while a man is carefull to study

the Scriptures, as Dauid was, and maketh them his meditation, hee shall soone become more wise then his teachers, and more able to direct himselfe, then the ancient, that think themselues able to giue councell. There shall not moue nor stir a corrupt lust in his heart, attempting to draw him aside to sin; but he being exercised in the study of Gods word, shal presently be able with iudgement to checke that desire of his heart, & to oppose against it Gods owne will.Secondly, vse the company of good men.
               
               Secondly let him frequent the company of good men, in whom hee seeth great power to subdue & keepe vnder disordered lusts then is in himselfe: and let him obserue & imitate their behauiour: this will helpe him much. For if the word of God on the one side giue him a rule how to keepe vnder his raging lusts, these men on the other side will be vnto him an example & patterne, shewing him how to doe it, and a very simple workman, when he hath not onely rules giuen him to direct his iudgment, but a patterne also laid before him to direct his hand, will very easily with this double helpe, learne to doe his worke

in some reasonable good manner, and vnto this helpe vnder God, the Apostle Paul doeth send vs saying, Brethren be
                  Phil. 3. 17. 
                  followers of me, and looke on them which walks so as you haue vs for an example. A man merrily ignorant of his way, if he follow carefully, step for step, a skilfull guide going before him, will very safely come to the place that he desireth: so shalt thou doe in the way of godlines, if thou keepe company with the godly, and marke their behauiour to doe thereafter. Augustin hauing respect of SaintPsal. 56. 
                  Paul, saith in one place, If thou faile in the precept, be strengthned in the example: that is, if by looking onely to the precept, thou canst not bring to passe to keepe it, looke to the example of them that doe after it, and their example shall much strengthen thee.
               Men are very apt to be led by examples, and are easily transformed into the manners of those whom they keepe company with: neither will their fellowship hold long, that doe not conforme themselues to the manners of their company. Dauid in one place hathPsa. 18. 25 this saying, With the godly thou wilt shew
                  
                  thy selfe godly, with the vpright man thou will shew thy selfe vpright, with the pure thou will shew thy selfe pure, and with the froward, thou will shew thy selfe froward. The Prophet speaketh these words of God, and we may safely speake them of men, among the godly, thou must shew thy selfe godly, learning and practising their godly behauiour; else they will haue small pleasure in thy company: and among the wicked thou must doe as they doe, else they will soone be weary of thee, and sly thy fellowship. The company therefore of the godly, cannot but be a great helpe vnto thee vnder God, to learne by them to subdue and keepe vnder thy vnruly lusts, if thou conuerse with them, and daily striuest to conforme thy selfe to their manners. This is a good degree of casting this burden vpon God.

                  lure and prouoke him vnto these sinnes, that by the corrupt lusts of his heart, he findeth himselfe most subiect vnto. For example, if his infirmitie be pronenesse to anger & wrath, let him auoid the company of contentions

               This rule the holy Ghost giues vs in many places. Salomon saith, Keepe thee
                  Pro 6. 24. 
                  from the wicked woman, and from the slattery of the tongue of the strange woman: desire not her beauty in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye-lid, Her cō
                  pany,

her countenance, and her wordes, all these are inticing occasions: and all these Salomon warneth him to shun that world not be betrayed by his owne frailty to commit whoredome. In another place he saith, Make no friendship
                  Pro. 22. 24 
                  with an angry man, neither goe with the furious man, least thou learne his waies, and receiue destruction to thy soule. Company and fellowship with the froward, will draw thee whether thou wilt or no into many brawles and quarrels, and otherwise also breedes danger vnto thee, & therefore to be shunned of him, that feareth his owne euill nature, too prone vnto anger. Againe, Looke not
                  Pro. 23. 32 
                  thou vpon the Wine when it is red, & when it sheweth his colour in the cup, and goeth downe pleasantly: in the end thereof it will bite like a Serpent, and hurt like a Cockatrice. The beautifull colour, and pleasant mouing of the Wine in the cup, are prouocations to drinking: hee that would not be ouertaken with drunkennes, knowing his owne appetite and weakenes, must shun these prouocations. Generally this is a veriy good rule for him that feareth the violence of his

               In the fourth place, let him often thinkFourthly thinke vpon iudgements and mercies vpon the iudgements of God threatned against sinne, and executed vpon sinners, that yeeld, and suffer themselues to be led away by their lusts: the threatnings he shal finde euery where in Gods word, and the executions he may see abroad in the world. Let him also meditate vpon the mercies of God promised vnto vertue, and performed vnto the vertuous that walke in the spirit, and putting vpon them the Lord Iesus Christ, doe take no care for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof: the promises hee shall meete with euery where in Gods

word, and the performances he may see abroad in the world▪ but especially in the church, and among the godly, whose company he was before aduised to frequent. These things obserued, 
                     〈◊〉
                   breede in him the feare of Gods power, and the loue of Gods mercy: which two will be vnto him, helps of great seruice against the lusts of his owne heart; while on the on side, the feare of God will make him walke in humility: and on the other fide the loue of God will make him to serue God with gladnesse. This is a very good way of casting this burden vpon God.
               Fiftly and lastly, (but continually and

                  eting him (by which name he vnderstood the burden of his troublesome corruptions) praied vnto God, if it might bee, to be freed from it. For all power to preuaile against sinne, and to

get the mastery ouer corruptions, is obtained by the gift of God, and by the worke of his grace in vs. Therefore doth Dauid pray to God in this manner, Teach mee o Lord the way of thy statutes,
                  Psal. 119. 33. 
                  and I will keepe it vnto the end: giue mee vnderstanding, and I will keepe thy law, yea I will keepe it with my whole heart▪ direct me in the path of thy commandements, for therein is my delight; incline mine heart vnto thy testimonies and not to couetousnesse. Thus earnestly doth he contend with God by praier to be assisted with his grace; which if he may obtain, hee feareth not to promise vnto God some obedience, notwithstanding whatsoeuer corruption abiding and mouing in his flesh. And so must euery man doe that is incumbred with his owne withdrawing lusts. This course will not be idle. What answer God will giue vnto such praier, wee may see by the answer giuen to Pauls praier, by him offered to the Lord Iesus vpon like occasion: fo

                  perfect through weakenesse. He was promised sufficient aid from the grace of Iesus Christ, that in his weakenesse, being vnable to extinguish those lusts, the power of Christ should perfectly appeare in strengthening him not to be ouercome of them. And if with Paul thou make the same praier vnto the Lord Iesus, the giuer of all grace, with Paul thou shalt obtaine the same answer, to be continually assisted with his sufficient grace, to preserue thee from being carried away by thy fleshly lusts. They shall haue being, to exercise thee in the warfare of this life: they shall not haue power to subdue thy heart to them.
               To take these courses hitherto prescribed. As first to exercise thy selfe in the study of holy Scriptures: Secondly, to frequent the company, and obserue the conuersation of holy men: Thirdly, to shun all occasions that may moue thy corrupt lusts to attempt euill action: Fourthly, to thinke often of the iudgements of God threatned against sinne, and executed vpon sinners; and of the mercies of God promised to vertue, and

performed to the vertuous: and lastly to m

can finde any the smallest hole, through which the light of hope may shine vnto vs. And it may fall out vnto vs as it did to the Prophet Ezechiel, who being entred in at the gate of the court, hee looked,
                  Ezec. 8. 7. 
                  and behold an hole was in the wall. Then the Lord bad him digge in the wall, and when he had diggd in the wall, behold there was a doore. The little hole which at the first he espied, while hee attempted to digge, became a dore, by which hee entered with ease. So may it fall out to thee in thy care of casting this burden vpon God for thy ease. The least hole that we can spie in the circumstances of our sinnes, through which hope of Gods mercy may shine vnto vs, if we take vnto vs the instrument of praier and digge therewith, may and will proue vnto vs a doore of mercy. For the mercy of God is like a floud that ouerfloweth. But where the waters of a floud finde but a smal hole to issue through at the first, by continuance, they weare the hole greater, make passage for themselues, and run at the last like a strong streame, that cannot be stopped. So the mercy of God appearing first at the hole of a small circumstance,

if thou continue in praier, and attend vpon God, wil worke it selfe freer passage, and in the end shine with full brightnesse in thy conscience, and the diuell shall not be able to darken the comfortable and glorious light of it.

                        •…
                      vrged generally. consider and weigh well the manner of his tentation, whether he be vrged in a distinct maner with any particular sin, 
                     •…
                  r whether he be more cōfusedly vrged and in a generall manner, that hee hath an euill heart, and is an hypocrite, and loueth not the Lord (and if the afflicted person cannot himselfe discerne the condition of his tētation, his iudgement being oppressed and darkened by his affliction; let the iudicious comforter, whose helpe he seeketh, obserue it for him) for Satan (that by Gods permission vrgeth against him this tentation) findeth in som men particular matter of enormious sinnes, as of murder in Cain, of adultery in Dauid, and of idolatry in Manasses: into which particular sinnes they haue broken licentiously with great boldnesse. Where hee hath this aduantage from our former

violent courses, he will be sure to vrge it to the vttermost (as making much for him) to driue vs into dispaire, to say with Cain, My punishment is greater
                  Gen. 4. 13. 
                  then I can beare. Or as Musculus reades it, agreeable, as he saith, to the Hebrew, Mine iniquity is greater then can be pardoned. In some others hee findeth no such particular grosse sinne, but they haue walked ciuilly and modestly: and where they did sin, (though that were very vsuall) yet they sinned of infirmity rather then of pride, and vpon prouocation rather then vpon free choice. Heere hee hath not aduantage as in the former. And therefore in a more generall and confused manner, he vrgeth against them their corruptions, but specially hypocrisie, and an vnsound heart, that they did abstaine from grosse sins, not out of any hatred that they did beare against such vile sinnes, but onely for feare of the peoples speech: and rather for want of meanes and opportunity to accomplish them, then for want of any good will, if time, & place, and other things had been answerable.
               And if thou finde that thine is such

a generall and confused tentation, asThere is ease in that that thou hast not fallen into grosse actuall sinne. namely, that thou diddest neuer rightly know, nor loue, nor feare God; and that thine heart was alwaies, or now is, an euill, an hypocritical heart; thine estate is so much the more easie, that in the dayes of thy security (while thou diddest walke according to the course of this world, and after the prince that ruleth in the ayre, euen the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience) God suffered not the Diuell to thrust thee into presumptuous sinnes, after the manner of others, and into grosse and desperate sinnes against all rules of honesty, wherewith hee might now in this time of temptation, torment thy conscience. This affordeth much aduantage vnto thee, that the diuell can finde no grosse particular sinne to vrge and presse thee withall.
               Here let the afflicted man first consider,Such is the originall estate of euery man conceiue
                        •…
                      in sinne. that hitherto his case is no whit worse then the case of euery man that commeth into the world. For Dauid doth tell vs, that the best man, euen he that prooueth afterwards a man after Gods owne heart, yet out of his mothers

wombe, yea out of his fathers loines proceedeth a sinnefull creature, with an euill heart empty of the loue of God, and continueth so, till God bestow some particular grace vpon him for the conuersion of him. And he maketh himselfe an instance heereof, speaking thus, Behold, I was borne in iniquity,
                  Psal. 51. 5. 
                  and in sinne hath my mother conceiued me. He was from the wombe and loines a sinner taken in generall termes, for a man in whom there was an euill heart, not knowing, not louing, not fearing God. And Saint Paul doth tell vs, that the holiest man, euen he that was from the beginning a chosen vessell to beare witnesse to the name of Iesus Christ before kings and nations, yet in his originall estate, and first yeares, hee is the childe of wrath, and dead in trespasses and sinnes, as all other men, till God in mercy looke vpon him, and renew him. And hee maketh himselfe among others an instance thereof, while hee thus speaketh; You hath be quickened,
                  Eples. 2. 1 
                  that were dead in trespasses and sinnes, wherein in times past ye walked according to the course of this world, and after the
                  
                  Prince that ruleth in the ayre, euen the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: among whom wee also had our conuersation in times past, in the lusts of our flesh, in fulfilling the will of the flesh and of the minde, and were by nature the children of wrath as well as others. Paul was a bad as the Ephesians, and the Ephesians as bad as all other men, til God in mercy conuerted both him & them. And the Prophet Ieremy telleth vs, that there is both generally and particularly, in all men, and in euery man, a heart both wicked and hypocritical: wicked to do that which is euill, deceitfull and hypocriticall to dissemble in the doing of it, and to make shews, pretences and excuses, that it might be thought not to doe euill. And this wickednesse and hypocrisie ro be so deepe and cunning, that it deceiueth, not onely other men, but euen the wicked man himselfe, that flattereth and pleaseth himself with his owne pretences, and perswadeth his owne soule, that all is well, and onely God is able to finde out his hypocrisie: for thus hee saith; The heart of man is

                  Hebr. 4. 13 
                  creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and open to his cies, with whom we haue to doe. Such is the depth of the wickednesse of mans heart, such is his deceitfull hypocrisie, that no eye but the all-seeing eye of God, no iudgement but his that neuer erreth▪ can see the same. And Salomon telleth vs, that there is no man iust vpon
                  Eccles. 7. 22. 
                  the earth▪ that doth good, and sinneth not. And knowing this to be generaly true, he challengeth euery man that thinkes that he can say any thing to cleere eyther himselfe, or any other, saying, Who
                  Prou. 20. 9 
                  can say, I haue made my heart cleane? I
                  
                  am cleane from my sinne. So that this is the condition of all men, till God in his mercy mould them anew by his grace: till then they are altogether such as thou in thy troubled heart art charged to be; men of an euill heart, full of wickednesse and hypocrisie, that neither know God, nor loue God, nor feare God.

creating a new heart, and renewing a right spirit in them.
               And now that mine eyes are opened by this affrighting of my soule, to see my bad condition, which I saw not before, I will make hast vnto the Lord, and will craue that grace at his hands, that I now want; neither can I, nor will I vnderstand this worke of his, in letting me see by this fearefull temptation my sinfull estate (which in the daies of my peace I did not see) to be any other, then the fruit of his loue, by making me to see my misery, to stir vp my soule (long drowned in former securitie) to seeke with all earnestnes of

When a sicke man feeleth paine in his flesh, he doeth not faintly yeeld to death, because he is sicke: but from the feeling of his weakenes, he taketh occasion to seeke out some learned Phisition, & craueth his help: & the more sicke he is the more he desireth, and the more earnestly he sueth for his helpe, & spares no cost, and putteth himselfe into the Phisitions power to be ordered by him. Euen so I, feeling feare in my soule, crept in by reason of these accusing thoughts,

that make me too sensibly to feele the dangerous sicknes of my soule, will not faintly yeeld vnto death that (I confesse) I haue deserued, and might iustly fall vpon mee: but euen from this feare, growing from my now reuealed sicknes, I will seeke out the Lord, that is the onely Phisition of our soules, who killeth,

                  all, why should I doe so great wrong, either to my owne present misery, or vnto Gods infinite mercy, to beleeue otherwise, but that God hath holden me thus long shut vp and fast bound in the prison and fetteres of my owne vnbeliefe and naturall infidelitie and wickednes, (which now I see) to the end that I might the more dearely esteeme of his mercy in freeing mee (which I will now call for) and that his mercy might bee, euen to his owne name, the more honorable in conuerting me. Thus may the afflicted sinner troubled with this generall & confused kinde of accusing thoughts, cast his burden comfortably vpon God, for in this kind of temptation, there is this hole in the wall, wherein while hee diggeth by continuall prayer, it may & will proue a dore of mercy, easie to be entred.
               And I further aduise this afflicted man,And haue care of the body to help the weakenes of it. when he feeleth himselfe entred or entring into this feare, and confused kind of temptation, that he will haue some care of his bodies health, and craue the aduice of some godly and learned Physition: for such confused feares are not

alwaies meerly spirituall temptations; but they doe often arise from some naturall decay in our bodily health, and from some distemper of humors in vs. Great is the affinitie betweene the soule and the body, and the proper passions & diseases of the one (by reason of that affinitie) make the other to be euill affected. If therefore the body be crazed, it will make the mind also to be diseased; and where the humor of Melancholy is predominare, & is not kept in any euen proportion in vs, it naturally driueth vs into deepe and dull, into sad, heauy, and fearefull thoughts and imaginations, and causeth doubtings and distrust: and with a little helpe of the wicked aduersary, it will quench all comfortable hope, and breede wofull dispaire in vs; and the Diuell is cunning to iudge of our distemperature, and where he findeth such weaknes, he will worke vpon it; as he worketh vpon the sanguine and pleasant mans disposition, to make him wanton and careles of God: and as he worketh vpon the cholericke and hastie mans disposition, to make him wrathfull and sudden

in mischeefe: & as he worketh vpon the fleginaticke to make him slothfull, colde and negligent of doing his dutie, & a louer of sloth & idlenes: so he will not faile to be busie with the man, in whom melancholy aboundeth, to make him full of feare, and void of hope. And lamentable are the effects, which often follow, where he findeth such matter to worke vpon. The wise Christian therefore, that is affrighted with this confused kinde of temptation, in termes of generall accusation, must not neglect to releeue his body, and to remoue from Sathans hand that euill humour that he maketh so dangerous vse of. This is a thing that the afflicted man often contemneth as carnall counsell: & indeed it were carnall counsell, if it should be required alone, without recourse vnto God by prayer: but it hath beene found by the mercy of God, to haue beene profitable counsell. And it is not to be neglected of him, that in this confused kind of tentatiō, desireth ease to his soule. And to take this with the former prescribed course, is to cast this burden vpon God.

It behoueth thee now to looke closely to thy selfe, and to marke, if thou canst espie any hole in the wall of hope to dig in, that a dore of mercy may be opened vnto thee.
               In this case, consider whether that orConsider if in were done in the time of thy ignorance. those sinnes were committed in the time of thine ignorance, when thou knewest not well what was lawfull or vnlawfull for thee to doe, or in the time of knowledge, when thine owne heart could tell thee that such things were not lawfull to be done: for if they were done in the time of ignorance, when perhaps thou mightest thinke it lawfull and free to be done, yea perhaps good, perhaps also profitable and necessarie, as Saul after called Paul, thought it lawfull, good,

and necessarie for him to persecute the name of Iesus, and to cast into prison them that called vpon that name: as hee said before King Agrippa; I verely
                  Acts. 26. 9. 
                  thought in my selfe, that I ought to doe many contrary things against the name of Iesus of Nazareth. Or if thou didst not thinke it to be lawfull, good & necessarie for thee, yet thou didst not thinke, or at the least didst not know it to be euill for thee to doe it, and any such danger to hang vpon it, with Gods high displeasure, as now thou perceiuest: then this very circumstance maketh thy burden lighter, and in the wall of hope, a hole appeareth, wherein if thou dig by prayer, a dore of mercy wilbe opened vnto thee.
               For though ignorance doth not excuse,Ignorance maketh thy sinne the sooner pardonable. much lesse iustifie our sinnes, and the discharge of that sinne will cost thy soule some teares, and prayers, and other like courses of a contrite heart: yet with more ease will the terror of it be ouercome, then if it had beene done against knowledge. Hereto pertaines that saying of our blessed sauiour, That
                  Luke 12. 47. 
                  seruant that knew his masters will, and
                  
                  prepared not himselfe, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes: but he that knew it not, and yet did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with fewer stripes. By these stripes some of the fathers vnderstand, not torments in hell of different rigor (though it cānot be denied, but the condition of some in hell, shall be more tollerable, then of some others) but thereby they vnderstand rather those gripes of conscience, that prouoke prayers, supplications, strong cryings, and teares, out of a heart beset and straightned with fierce accusations, a conuinced conscience, & feared condemnatiō: & these assaults they say, shall be more hard against the conscience of him that siuned against knowledge, in a presuming manner, then against the conscience of him that sinned of ignorance, in a weaker manner, that is yeelding rather out of his weaknes, then daring out of his pride: for it may be alledged for the ignorant man, that if he had knowne such a thing to be euill in the sight of God, he would not haue done it. No such thing can be said for him that presumed against knowledge,

for such an one sheweth contempt of God and of his reuealed will, which the ignorant man cannot be charged with all: hee groneth only vnder the burden of humane errour and frailty, but the other lieth vnder the burden of malice and presumption.
               Therefore when our afflicted man, pressed distinctly with some particular sinnes, findeth that they were the sinnes of his ignorance, let him not thinke himselfe thereby free: for to be ignorant of that which is our duty, required of God, is of it selfe a great sinne: and if his ignorance be affected ignorance, as in them that refuse to be taught, and contemne the meanes of knowledge, when God doth offer them, such ignorance differeth little or nothing from malice. But let him pray vnto God in hope, and let him plead before God his ignorance, not as an excuse, much lesse as a iustification of his fault, but as a motiue, byExamples of then

and conuersion to God, mercy to the forgiuenesse of their sinnes of ignorance hath beene granted. Peter in a sermon of his made vnto the multitude, that came together to see the lame man whom he and Iohn had healed, chargeth them with a grieuous sinne, saying. You denied the holy one and the iust, and desired
                  Acts. 3. 14. 
                  a muràerer to be giuen you, and killed the Lord of life, whom God raised from the dead, where of we are witnesses. This was a great sinne, to kill the sonne of God, and to make more reckoning of, and to shew more fauour vnto a knowen murderer, then to the Lord of life that came to saue them. But this their fact he saith was of ignorance. And now brethren I
                  Acts 3. 17. 
                  know that through ignorance you did it, as did also your gouernors. For though the lews were very maliciously bent against Iesus, yet many of them knew him not to be the Lord of life, and to be the holy one of God: neither did they persecute him in that name. Therefore doth Saint Peter sa

that amend their liues and turne to God, namely this mercy, that all their enormious sinnes, and euen among the rest, their sinne in refusing the Lord Christ, and putting him to a shamefull death, should be forgiuen, and the rather, because they did it ignorantly.
               And memorable is the example of the blessed Apostle Paul. His sinne was persecutiō against the name of Iesus Christ: his proceeding in it was furious, without all compassion, raging both against men and women that called vpon that name, and casting them into prison in all places, where he could finde them, and had power against them. In such sort, that hee became famous, or to speake more truely, infamous for his cruelty, so that Ananias in Damascus could say to the Lord Iesus of him. Lord I haue
                  Acts 9. 13. 
                  heard by many of this man, how much euil he hath done to thy Saints in Ierusalem: moreouer, here hee hath authority of the high Priests, to bind

earth, to any among the followers of the Lord Iesus. For first he was called to the knowledge and faith of the Lord Iesus, and was made a true beleeuer: Secondly, he had honour, not only to belieue in him, but also to suffer for his sake, and was made a true confessour and marter. Thirdly, he was also an excellent instrument to draw other men to the knowledge and faith of Iesus, and was made a teacher and an Apostle. And all this was the more freely done to him, because when hee was a persecurour▪ hee finned of ignorance, and knew no other, but that it was lawfull and holy for him to doe so.

Ignorance and vabeleese are not things pleasing ro God, by their vertue and merit, obtaining forgiuenes of all the sins growing out of them: neither doth the Apostle remember his ignorance and vnbeleefe

obtaining his pardon, as out of worthinesse of them: rather know them in themselues to be grieuous sins, deseruing hell as fully as any notorious sinne that issueth from them: but he that sinneth out of ignorance, more easily findeth fauour, then hee that sinneth against knowledge. For the sinne of the ignorant man hath not in it like euidence of rebellion against the reuealed will of God, as the sin of him that hath knowledge; As the words of the Lord Iesus shew, spoken to some of the Pharisies; If ye were blind, ye should not haue

                  sinne: that is, if yee wanted knowledge, and were blind in your vnderstanding, your fault should not bee so great, so notorious, so blame-worthy, as now it is, by reason of your knowledge.
               There is therefore (though no merit of fauour yet) much hope for him, that can say truely in his heart vnto GOD, Lord thou knowest, that blindly and ignorantly I ranne into this sinne, not knowing that it was against thy will, and so odious in thy sight. And this is for him, that is distinctly charged with particular sinnes, and findes that hee

committed them out of ignorance; a doore of hope, in which these examples may incourage him, to digge by prayer, wherein if hee doe truely, and with a right penitent heart humbly and earnestly trauell, he casteth the burthen of his sinnes vpon God; and shall finde case.

Such a rule must needes haue sent to hell many of Gods beloued Saints, that now are with him in heauen: who while they liued on earth, were sometime vrged with sodaine, and sometime with violent temptations, and haue yeelded, sometime without consideration, and sometime with consideration: and yet after, by the mercie of God, haue recouered themselues, and haue glorified GOD, both in their life and death, & are now glorified of him in his kingdome. And why shouldest not thou, if thy sinne be like theirs, hauing to do with the same God of mercie, hope to finde the same fauour that they found? Surely this very circumstance, that thou

wert surprised by a sodaine or violent temptation, & led captiue to do euill, against thine owne liking, that didst take no pleasure in it; yea wert exceedingly grieued, that thou hadst not strength & grace to withstand it, is a hole in the wall of hope, through which light shineth, and wherin if thou dig by humble & hearty prayer, it may proue a doore of mercy for thee to enter by, & come neare to God, to be eased of thy burdē.
               Here consider the example of the Apostle Peter: his sin was a grieuous fin,Examples of men pardoned that thus sinned in the time of knowledge. for he denied before men his master the Lord Iesus Christ: he did so, once, twice, and thrice, & each time more vehemētly then other: for first he simply denied him, & passed it ouer with this saying, I know not the man. At the second time he augmented his sin with addition of an oath, and forsweares him. The third time he yet augmented his sinne more, with addition of grieuous execrations, and cursed himselfe; that is, wished himselfe accursed, if hee know him. And he did this in the time of knowledge, after he had learned, that to do so was sinne, and dangerous to his soule. For he had

heard his Maister openly before speake thus; Whosoeuer shall confesse mee before men, him will I confesse before my Father
                  Mat. 10. 32 
                  in heauen: but whosoeuer shal deny me befnre men, him wil I deny before my Father which is in heauen. And though it were a true saying, out of a liars mouth, skin

                  for skinne, and all that euer a man hath, will hee giue for his life. Yet this is true also, and to be regarded aboue the other, that all that a man hath, euen skin and life also, hee must giue, cast away, and esteeme as vile, that he may follow Christ to glorifie him by true confession. Which course only hath power to secure life. As Peter also had heard from the mouth of his Lord, saying, If

This Peter had heard, this he knew. And besides these general caueats long before giuen, Peter was also priuately forewarned of this thing, euen the same night a little before he did it: when he also took knowledge of that warning,

and resolued with himselfe not to doe it; yea, made open vow not to doe it. For when the Lord Iesus Christ, after his last Supper, a little before his apprehension, hee tolde the Apostles, that they that night should all be offended by him. Peter boldely answered and saide vnto him; Though all men should be offended, yet will not

                   suspition; that his speech bewrayed him to be a Galilean, and Iesus came out of Galilee, and therefore hee was not vnlikely to be one of his followers. At last a coosin of his, whose care Peter had smo

                  e off in the garden, flatly affirmed, that hee did see him in the garden with him. Peter affrighted sodainely with these challenges, and being in the middest of them whom hee esteemed his enemies, seeing at the present no way to escape; yea, hauing no leisure to thinke what was fittest for him to doe, denyed his Maister, and bound his deniall with oaths and curses.
               Was not this a sin against the knowledge of his heart? and what hast thou done, in the particular sinnes, that thou ar

freely granted to Peter for the forgiuenes of his sins. Goe forth therefore with Peter in the sight of thy sins, poure out the teares of repentance before God as Peter did, and he that receiued Peter to grace, wil also receiue thee.

So that I am not the man, but Peter: nor Peter out of speculation, and from his owne conceit, but out of experience, and vpon most sure authority,

from the mouth of his Master, the sonne of God, the sauior of mankind, the Iudg of quicke & dead, that is warranted to tell thee, that there is mercy with God, to forgiue thy sinnes committed▪ against knowledge, if in this sorrow & feare of thine heart, thou turne to God, and hartily prayest vnto him for pardon, with purpose no more to cōmit the like sin.
               I could adde the examples of many of Gods Saints, that sinned against knowledge, being carried away with a sodaine and violent temptation, so that either they had no leisure to thinke what was fittest to doe, or they wanted power to withstand the present assault, and they after found fauour with God, and their sinnes being forgiuen, they liue with him in glorie. Iacobs lie, maintained to his father Isaacs face, that hee was not Iacob the yonger, but Esau

of the state, Mephibosheth beeing the right heire to Saul, might seek to make a faction for him. And Dauid had need now of friends, and therefore thought fit to make Ziba sure on his side. These and like considerations darkening Dauids iudgement, gaue strength to the temptation. And hee sinned in condemning the innocent, and rewarding the wicked accuser, and that against knowledge, for he was not ignorant of the duety of a Iudge. And yet all these haue found fauor, and their sinnes haue beene forgiuen vnto them. Why then should thy heart faint, and thy hope faile, because thy conscience tels thee, that thou hast sinned against knowledge. Repent and turne to God, pray and thou shalt be heard.

               The Pharises heard the doctrine of our Lord Iesus Christ, and saw his miracles, and knew him to bee that sonne of Dauid, that Messias that was promised: they knew his doctrine to be holy and heauenly▪ and his workes to bee wrought by the finger of God.

because they then cryed out saying; Is not this that sonne of Dauid? They therefore out of enuy and mallice, without any other cause, gaue it out concerning him, saying. He casteth out Diuels no otherwise, but by Belzebub the prince of Diuels: Indeuoring by these wordes to perswade the people that he was a wicked man, risen vp out of Hell, set vp by the Prince of diuels, and assisted with his power, to publish the doctrine of diuels, and to vphold his kingdome: so slaundering the person of Christ, the workes of Christ, and the doctrine of Christ: all which many of them knew to be heauenly and of God.
               If they had not knowne him to bee thee sonne of God, they had not beene guilty of that great sinne. As the LordIohn. 9. 41. said vnto them, If ye were blind, ye should not haue sinne, your ignorance would haue cleered you from this wi

did they out of enuy detract from the glory of his workes, that they might by that meanes bring both his person and heauenly doctrine into contempt.
               And they ceased not this course of slandering his person, of disgracing his workes, and obscuring the truth of his doctrine, laying wait also for his life (for God giueth not repentance for this sinne) till they had bought him with money of the traytor, iudged him to be worthy of death vpon the knowne false testimonie of suborned witnesses, extorted with their clamours his condemnation from an vnwilling Iudge (pronouncing him iust, whom he condemned for their pleasure) added vnto his vniust death what reproch they could, and after his resurrection, corrupted the souldiers with money, so causing it to be by them divulged, that his disciples stole away his body out of the graue, and that he did not rise againe from the dead: by that course labouring (out of enuy) to suppresse the Gospell and doctrine of Iesus Christ, which yet they knew, by the illumination of the holy Ghost, to be the very truth of God.
               
                  This malitious opposition of theirs against religion, knowne to be the religion of God, was their vnpardonable sinne.

thou hast not sinned that vnpardonable sinne against the holy-Ghost; and that thy sinne whatsoeuer, and howsoeuer committed, though deseruing a thousand Hels, is yet by the mercie of God pardonable, where he is pleased to giue repentance of that sinne, and vppon that repentance to blot out the remembrance of it.

               This obiection consisteth of threeAnswer to this obiectiō
                   branches: the first is this, that his wilfull

sinne comes so neere to the height of that vnpardonable sinne, that the angry eye of heauen (hee feareth) can and will see no difference betweene them. This will easily bee answered. And to beginne our answer, I must intreat this afflicted sinner to remember, that it hath been already declared, that his sinne, though grieuous, yet is pardonable. And let him to this purpose, againe heare the words of our Sauiour Iesus, All sinnes shall be forgiuen vnto
                  Mar. 3. 28. 
                  the children of men, and blasphemies wherewith they blaspheme. And how neere soeuer his sinne commeth to the vnpardonable sinne, yet, not being it, it remaineth pardonable. And this ground of trueth can neuer bee ouerthrowne.
               And the anger of heauen, being alwayesTo the first part of it. iust euen and holie, doth neither shaddow the vnderstanding, nor disorder the iustice of God, that hee should not be able to discerne the difference of things that are not the same, or infold them rashly, and disorderedly in the same sentence. Anger is not in God a disturbing passion, as it is in men:

But it is the most euen and holy carriage of his iustice, as becommeth the righteous Iudge of all the world, pouring out his plagues vpon sinners, and executing vengeance vpon contemners, according to the rule of his owne word, where with hee hath made vs aforehand acquainted, and according to the merites of mens workes, against which their owne consciences (iustifying God in his iudgements) shall not be able to make any exception, to say, that in any thing hee hath erred from the streight rule of iustice. And this iustice is that, which (in terms agreeable to our conceit) is called his anger. His eie therefore cannot bee deceiued in esteeming of mens sinnes. I remember a good speech of Saint Ambrose to this purpose, God lieth not open to passion,
                  In psalm
                        •…
                      37. 
                  that he should be angry, seeing hee is subiect to no passion: but because hee reuengeth, he seemeth to be angrie, to vs this seemeth, because we vse to reuenge with a troubled minde: So that as anger signifieth a disturbed passion of the mind, troubling our vnderstanding, and peruerting our iustice, there is no anger,

there can (by this Fathers iudgement) no anger be in God: but Gods iust reuenge wee call anger, because our reuenge is mingled with anger. Away therefore with this conceit, that the anger of Heauen should not discerne betweene thy sinne, and blasphemy against the holy-Ghost. The anger of Heauen is nothing else but the iust reuenge of Heauen.
               A second branch of thine obiectionTo the second part of it. is this, that though the blasphemy of the holy-Ghost be the onely sinne vnpardonable, yet it is not the only sinne vnpardoned. It is not the onely sinne punishable, nor onely punished: thine also is a sin punishable, and may proue a sinne punished. I confesse all this to be true, what then? Doth it follow, that needes thou must be punished, because thou maiest be punished? that consequence must not be granted, for then it would follow, that there should bee no place for any forgiuenesse at all, for sinnes are punishable, and deserue eternall death. To reason so, were to spoile God of his honour that hee obtaineth by forgiuing sinne, where of the Prophet

                  Micah speaketh, saying; Who is
                  Mica 7. 18 
                  a God like vnto thee, that taketh away iniquitie, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage, &c. It is Gods great honour to pardon sins that are punishable. And it is an intollerable iniurie offered to the riches of his grace, to affirme that hee will not forgiue in mercy, because hee may punish in iustice. And such reasoning as this, would also make false all his promises, and make vaine and vnprofitable the hope of all his saints grounded vppon those promises, for there is none of them that hath not committed many punishable sinnes, which yet they hope shall neuer be punished. Yea it would make void the passion of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, and depriue him of the honour due vnto him by the saying of Iohn Baptist, Behold the Lambe of God
                  Iohn 1. 29. 
                  that taketh away the sinne of the world. For verily euen those sinnes for which this Lambe was slaine and sacrificed, and which by the vertue of that sacrifice of himselfe he taketh away, are punishable sinnes, sinnes deseruing the most heauy wrath of God, and the most

cruel torments of hell. Away therefore with this idle reasoning, my sins are punishable, and therefore it helpeth mee nothing to heare that they are pardonable. Where sin aboundeth to deserue punishment, there grace aboundeth much more to remit punishment.
               The last branch of thy obiection isTo the third part of it. this, that lesse sinnes then thine, and sins more easie to be excused, are often punished; then why not thine? There is no reason that this thing should offend thee, that smaller sins are punished. The Creditor may see reason to forgiue to one debtor many pounds, and yet not to forgiue another a few pence. The punishment of hell is due to all sinners, leaue God the Iudge to the freedome of his owne will, to shew mercy where it pleaseth him to shew mercy, and to forgiue, where, and what and how it pleaseth him to forgiue. Little sins, when men continue them, and regard not to repent of them, are brought to iudgement as well as great ones. And great sins, when men forsake them, & are carefull to repent of them, are put out and forgotten as well as the

smallest. It is not the greatnesse and smallnesse of sins that makes them to be retained or remitted, but it is repentance that 
                     •…
                  reeth from al together. This is plaine by the words of Esay, who hauing called for repentance, that the people should cease to doe euill, and, learne to doe well: immediatly addeth,Esay 1. 18. saying, Come now, and let vs reason together, (saith the Lord) Though your sinnes were as crimson, they shall be made white as snow, though they were red like scarlet, they shall be as woll. Though the spots of them were neuer so foule, and though the staine of them were neuer so deepe, yet God will forgiue the sinne, and forgiuing it, he will cleanse and purge the sinner, This great mercy for the forgiuenesse of most great sins is promised to repentance. Where repentance is wanting, the smallest sins shall bring the transgressour to iudgement; but where true repentance is found, the greatest sinnes shall be done away. Be carefull then to turne from thy former euill waies, and bring forth fruit worthy amendment of life, and God will free thee from all thy sinnes.
               
                  And thus it appeareth, that all the feare (that bred this obiection;) first, that thy sinne comes so neere that vnpardonable sinne of blasphemy against the holy-Ghost, that the angrie eie of heauen can see no difference betweene them. Secondly, that thy sinne, though pardonable, yet is punishable, and therefore must bee punished. Thirdly, that smaller sinnes then thine come to iudgement, and therefore thine being greater, cannot in iustice be passed by▪ All this feare is needlesse feare, and thy sinne still remaineth pardonable, and thou maiest comfortably hope for, and shalt assuredly obtaine forgiuenesse of thy sins, if thou turne to God, ca

For this I can alledge the expresse word of God, and therefore am sure, that my feare is not vaine, the Prophet Dauid speaking to God, who would soone haue checked his speech, if it had not beene true, saith. Thou art not
                  Psal. 5. 4.

Here is depriuation of Gods loue, expulsion from dwelling with him, and from standing before him, here is the hatred of God, & in his hatred destruction, threaned to them, as to men abhorred of God, that worke wickednes, that are doers of euill, that in the foolishnes of their hearts committed iniquitie, that in their talke speake lies, that haue bluddie handes, cruell hearts, and cunning and deceitfull heades. But such an one am I▪
                  
I haue wrought wickednes, I haue done euill, I haue through the foolishnes of mine heart committed much iniquitie, I haue beene a lyar, my handes are full of bloud, I haue beene cruell & deceitfull, therefore I am depriued of Gods loue, I shall not dwell in his kingdome, not be able to stand before him in iudgement▪ I am iustly hated of him and, shall bee iustly destroied by him, and hee must needes abhor me as a thing most vile. Who can speake against these things grounded on such authoritie? must not the seuere iustice of heauen condemne such sinnes as mine are? must not the pure holines of heauen exclude such vile sinners as I am? surely it may be called prodigall mercy, if such sinnes as mine escape vnpunished, and if such a sinner as I may euer be saued.

But they ioyne together in one to increase this poore mans feare, yet let vs helpe him with

our answere. It is a comely thing to to thinke reuerently of the iustice and holines of heauen: for certainely iustice will not suffer the least sinne to escape vnpunished, neither will holines euer suffer any vncleane thing to enter into the kingdome of heauen. Yet that cannot hence be concluded that thou gatherest, namely that therefore mercy can find no free passage, to forgiue thy sinnes, and to bring thee to glory, for the wisdome and power and loue of heauen (which are able to worke wonders aboue the reach of mans vnderstanding) will find; yea haue found; out a way, to satisfie iustice by the punishing of sinne▪ and to satisfie holines by the purging of sinne, and yet to saue the sinner that committed that sinne.

               The glorious Trinitie by an eternall decree, (ordained defore all time, and effected in the fulnes of time) sent downe the eternall word, the second person, called the sonne, who being conceiued by

the holy Ghost, tooke flesh, and was borne of the virgin Mary (of the linage of Dauid) and was made man, true man, the sonne of man, the sonne of Adam, of Abraham, and of Dauid, in all things like vnto vs, yet without sinne: and him the father gaue vnto vs to be our mediator, and to be the Lord our righteousnes, and to the satisfying of the iustice of heauen, God laied vpon him our sinnes, and he willingly submitted himselfe, to the burden of our sinnes, to the curse of the law, to the death of the crosse, and to the wrath of his father, for those sinnes of ours. Excellent to this purpose is the testimonie of Esaie speaking more like an Euangelist, or an apostle, then like a Prophet, saying. He was wounded

sinnes, and he was contented to stand before God a sinner in our name. The stripes, the woundes, the death, that we deserued, hee receiued sustained and indured for vs. Thus iustice is satisfied & our sinnes being in him punished, it were iniustice to punish the same sinnes againe in them that plead the suffringes of Iesus for them. Thus are his stripes our cure, his woundes our health▪ and his death our life. Vnto that saying of Esaie, let vs ad another of the ApostleGal
                        •…
                     . 3. 3. Saint Paul. Christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the law, when hee was made a curse for vs, for it is written, cursed is euery one that hangeth on tree, that the blessing of Abraham might come vpon the gentiles through Iesus Christ. The law curseth euery one that abideth not in all that is written in that booke to doe it, and we haue failed in all, or in most, and the sentence of the curse did lie vpon vs, then it pleased the Lord Iesus Christ by yeelding himselfe to the cursed death of the crosse, to take vpon him the curse that should haue fallen vpon vs. So was iustice executed according to that sentence of the law, & iustice so

satisfied giueth waie to mercy, for the curse being borne by Iesus Christ, the blessing promised to Abraham is our inheritance. Here the one halfe of thy feare is remoued, because in the death of Iesus Christ iustice hath receiued satisfaction for thy sinnes, if thou plead this satisfaction, by what iustice art thou to be punished for thy sinnes.
               The other halfe of thy feare is this,Secondly concerning holines. that the holines of heauen will neuer suffer such an vncleane sinner, as thou art to enter into the kingdome of God, to remoue this feare, vnderstand that the same Lord Iesus Christ, that bare ou

                  ed to vs, that all our vnrighteousnes and vncleanenes both originall and actuall, being therewith hidden and couered from the view of God most holy, wee might appeare cleane & spotles in him, to the satisfying of the holines of heauen. Therefore is it that Paul saith, speaking of Iesus. God hath made him to be sinne for vs, which knew no sinne, that
                  
                  we should be made the righteousnes of God in him. This place plainely sheweth, that God made an exchang betweene Iesus Christ and vs. He knew no sinne, that is, he had no acquaintance nor fellowship with sinne, in him was no sinne, to deserue death. That sinne abounded in vs, and God laied it vpon Iesus, and he died for it. On the other side we had no righteousnes, no righteousnes of God, that is no such pure and perfect righteousnes as God requireth, and as might commend vs vnto God, to be admitted for it into heauen. That righteousnes was in Iesus Christ who fulfilled all righteousnes, keeping the law, bearing perfect loue both to God & man, and performing all offices pertaining to that loue: and that righteousnes of his doth God impute vnto vs, making vs righteous in him. Therefore is it that the Prophet Ieremie calleth him the Lord our righteousnes. And this
                  Ierem. 2

vs) but our righteousnes, because in him we are accepted, and his righteousnes offered vnto God for vs, is accepted as our righteousnes, and the reward of it is giuen vnto vs. His righteousnes is our righteousnes, yea hee himselfe is our righteousnes, and in him we are righteous. not without reference vnto that place of the Prophet Ieremie, doeth the Apostle Paul say thus of him. You are of
                  1. Cor. 1. 30. 
                  him in Iesus Christ, who of God is made vnto vs wisdome, and righteousnes, and sanctification, and redemption. First he is made vnto vs wisdome, that is, in him, and by the knowledge of him, wee attaine vnto that wisdome, which only is worthy of that name, which philosophie, and all the religions in the world (the Gospell of Iesus Christ excepted) could neuer afford vs, for this wisdome maketh vs wise vnto saluation. secondly, he is made vnto vs righteousnes, that is, by the imputation of his righteousnes vnto vs we are accepted as righteous and holy, and are in him righteous and holy. Thirdly he is made vnto vs sanctification, that is, in him, and by the vertue of his death and resurreotion, we are recouered

out of the dominion of sinne, and haue power giuen vs to keepe vnder, suppresse, & mortifie our earthly members, and carnall lusts, and doe, euen in this sinfull world, make beginning to serue God in holines and righteousnes, with sinceritie and truth of heart. Lastly he is giuen to be vnto vs redemption, that is, when we are once made wise by the knowledge of him, and are iustified by his imputed righteousnes, & sanctified by his quickning grace, we shall in the end vndoubtedly come to full redemption in heauen by him. And by his meanes, thou which of thy selfe art an vncleane person, such an one as the holines of heauen may iustly denie entrance vnto, art made in Iesus Christ a most holy and pure person, worthily admitted by the holines of God to enter into glory. And this other part of thy feare, and so thy whole obiected feare is remoued: the iustice of God that will haue sinne punished, and the holines of God that will suffer no vncleane thing to stand before him, both hauing receiued full satisfaction in the mediation of Iesus Christ: Iustice in his death suffred

for vs, and holines in his perfect obedience and righteousnes imputed vnto vs: & so free way is made for the mercy of God (which thou foolishly callest prodigall mercy. For nothing euer was with more wise prouision bestowed) to come vnto thee, & to forgiue thy great and abominable sinnes, and to saue a great and an abominable sinner.
               Now therefore fall to praier, & in theIncouragement vpon this answere name of so gracious a mediator, intreat the most merciful & louing God, to forgiue thy sins, & to receiue thee to fauor.

Or did he dissemble, or promise this fainedly? when he had no meaning to performe it? who can say otherwise of the God of trueth, but that he fully intended to performe his promise? or hath hee forgotten now▪ what hee promised then, that by this meanes, his promise should be as no promise, because not remembred to be euer giuen? who can imagine this of that God, who knew all his owne workes from▪ the beginning, to whom all times both past and to come are euer present, and of whom the Prophet saith. He hath alwaies remembred his couenant,

conscience, and marke them well, and if they be thy sinnes (which thou canst not denie) as the Lord Iesus hath giuen thee leaue by his commandement, to aske forgiuenes, so God the father of our Lord Iesus Christ, hath promised to grant thee forgiuenes of them. Here is a dore of mercy set wide open; enter confidently, but humbly with thy praier in the name of Iesus the mediator.

forgiuenesse, neither doth nor can pertaine vnto him: pleading against himselfe, in this manner. This commandement of Christ, that giueth leaue to aske and hope to receiue forgiuenesse of sins cannot belong vnto me, neither haue I any right to the benefit and aduantage of it, because that commandement is giuen to them that can call God their father, for so beginneth the Lords praier wherein that commandement is comprehended, our father which art in heauen.

By this rule of Peter, they which call God their father ought to be holy as he is holy, but I am altogether profane. They ought to passe the time of their life reuerently in the feare of God, but I haue beene and am a contemner of him: and their doings should not be after the lusts of their own heart, that beare sway in the daies of ignorance, but I neuer followed other rule, then the lusting of mine owne heart, I neuer stroue to suppresse and mortifie them.

Also if I had the spirit of God in mee, the fruits of that spirit would bud, and shew forth themselues in mee: but all is contrary. The Apostle Paul saith, the

                  fruit of the spirit is loue, ioy, peace, long suffering, gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith, meekenesse, and temperance. There is none of these to be seene in mee, but the fruits of the flesh are plentifull in mee. With them I am ouergrowen both in body and soule. The Apostle reckoneth them vp in this order.

And in these sinnes I haue liued, and dwelt, and delighted, if not in all, yet in many of them, and if not in many, yet in some of them, inough to quench the spirit of God, if the fire thereof had at any time beene kindled in mee. How then can it be that I should haue the holy Ghost? And not hauing the holy Ghost, how can I call God my father? and if I haue no right nor power to call God my father, that leaue to craue the forgiueuesse of sinnes, and that hope to obtaine forgiuenesse of sinnes, which are grounded vpon that commandement of Iesus, pertaine not to mee.

the whole man, both body and soule, in carnall and spirituall fornication: and hee dishonoured his mercifull Father, while to his sinfull courses for the furthering thereof, he conuerted all the gfits and graces, that hee had receiued of God. This was his behauiour, being departed from his father. In the end, by misery iustly fallen vpon him, hee was touched, ashamed, and confounded, as thou art: (seest thou not thine estate liuely described in the estate of this prodigall man?) yet after all this wandering and wicked behauior, and much misery that hee indureth, hee remembreth his fathers house, he repenteth, he returneth, and humbly praieth: and the successe was, he is gratiously receiued into fauour.
               Take this example vnto thee, and view it well, dwell vppon it with holie meditation.

Iohn 3. 9 when thou speakest of the testimony of the Spirit, thou makest the Spirit to be as a witnesse that testifieth the fatherly loue of God vnto vs. And so indeed

the Holy-Ghost within vs, is vnto our hearts a true witnes of Gods loue. Paul to this purpose saith, Yee haue receiued
                  Rom. 8. 15. 
                  the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father. The same spirit beareth witnesse with our spirit, that wee are the children of God. And Saint Peter in his speech before the Priest and Captain of the Temple, calleth the holy-Ghost a Witnesse, saying, Wee are his witnesses
                  Matt. 5. 32. 
                  concerning these things which we say, yea and the holy-Ghost, whom God hath giuen to them that obey him. For the Lord Iesus hath two sorts of witnesses, to confirme to the consciences of men, the truth of his death and resurrection, and his power of sanctifying and sauing. The one sort is, the Apostles and Ministers, who by their doctrine doe beare witnesse to the outward man, and the other is the holy-Ghost, who opening the vnderstanding, and leading into all truth, doth beare witnes to the inward man.
               Now for seed, we know that when it is cast into the ground, it doeth not presently bring forth ripe fruit: nay, it doth not presently spring vp and shew

it selfe, but it resteth for a while in the wombe of the earth, hidden from the eyes of men, till conuenient time commeth: and if any man in the mean time should say, I see no fruit aboue the ground, therefore there is no seede in the ground, hee might be deceiued, and the Husbandman and Gardner that had sowne the ground, would censure him both of ignorance and boldnesse, and time would disprooue him.
               And as for witnesses, we know, that they do not speake, so soone as a man is prouided of thē, nor yet so soon as they appeare in publique place; but being first prepared, and after brought to the place where they should giue testimony, they yet stay, and keep silence: and when the Iudge or Examiner is at leisure, then they are called for, and speak their knowledge. And he that reasons thus, there hath yet no witnesse spoken forsuch a mā, therfore he hath no witnesse to speake at all for him, should shew himselfe a rash man, and by the timely voyce of the witnesses would be conuinced.
               Euen so it is too much rashnesse in

thee, to say, that because thou yet hearrest not the testimonie of the Holie-Ghost in thy heart, witnessing with thy spirit, that thou art the child of God, therefore there is no such witnesse at al to speake when God shall appoint. And because thou yet seest not the fruits of the spirit in the actions of thy life: that therefore there is in thee no seed of the Spirit that may bring forth these fruits in due time. Learne to haue patience, & wait vpon the good pleasure of God, & in time thou shalt see a blessed chāge, & heare that testimonie which yet thou hearest▪ not, and see those fruits of the Spirit, which yet thou seest not.
               And if it were as thou speakest, that thou hadst not at all the Spirite, as seed lying in secret, and attending the time of Spring, or as a witnesse prepared to speake when God shal call him fo

                  which are euill can giue good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heauenly
                  
                  Father giue the holy-Ghost to them that desire him. So that if there be in thee a true desire to obtaine the holy-Ghost, aske and it shall be giuen thee, for the Lord is more ready to giue then thou canst be to aske. All that matter therefore of thy feare, for that commandement of Christ, that giueth leaue to ask, and hope to obtaine forgiuenesse of sins, that it should not belong to thee, because it must be asked of them that haue God for their Father, and thou thinkest him not to be thy Father, because thou doest neither resemble him as yet, either in the verues of thy mind, or actions of thy life; and thou hast not the spirit of adoption, by which thou maiest cry Abba Father, for thou neither seest the fruits, nor feelest the testimonies of that spirit: all this matter of thy feare is vaine.
               That commandement of Christ belongeth to thee: God is thy Father, thou oughtest to pray vnto him for forgiuenesse, thou maiest pray vnto him for forgiuenesse, and if thou pray, thou shalt obtaine forgiuenesse. Pray therefore as Christ hath commanded thee, and the

obseruation of his order shall prooue thine ease.

                  OVr afflicted sinner was incouraged to pray, and to hope for forgiuenesse of his sinnes, not onely by the commandement of Iesus Christ, which giueth leaue and hope, but also, and more strongly by the promise of God, assuring in plaine words that it shall bee granted to him. I will forgiue their iniquitie,
                  Iere. 31. 34 
                  and will remember their sinnes no more. But the nature of his temptation, suffering no comfort to enter and abide with him, armeth him with an obiection against that incouragement in this manner. I know that God hath madeThe fourth obiection; promise of forgiuenesse to Israel. such a liberall promise. I know that he made it aduisedly, vnderstanding himselfe what he promised, that hee made it in truth, meaning to performe faithfully as much as hee promised: and that he remembers his promise for euer, for time can not worke forgetfulnesse in

him, nor any shadow of alteration, and therefore it shall be most truely and fully performed. But it pertaineth not to mee for any aduantage and benefit of mine: for the Prophet telleth vs it is a couenant made with the house of Israel, for these are his words; This shall be
                  Ier. 31. 33.

But I am no Israelite, howsoeuerBut I am no Israelite. you shall take the name: for if you vnderstand it in the naturall signification for the children of Iacob, in the twelue Tribes of Israel, I am not of that kinred, I am of the Gentiles. And if I were naturally of the seed of Israel, yet might I very well loose all lawfull challenge to that promise, because Saint Paul saith, All they are not Israel which are
                  Rom. 9 6 
                  of Israel: But if you take the name in the spiritual signification, for a child of promise, an heire of grace, and a preuailer with God (and in that sence was it first giuen to Iacob. when he wrestled with the Angell, and preuailed, not letting him goe, vntill hee had blessed him) in this signification. It doth yet much lesse agree to mee, that am rather an Egyptian,
                  
a Cananite, an Edomite, and an enimie of God, rather then a preuailer with him. I neuer wrestled with God by faith and praier (as Iacob) to preuaile with him: but rather I haue wrestled with God by pride and malice as a professed aduersarie, I haue bidden defiance to God in the contempt of my proud heart, & I haue made fierce war against God in my many sinnes, striuing to preuaile against him, neuer desiring to preuaile with him: and thence is it, that now in iustice and power, hee beareth himselfe so strongly against me. Therefore being no way an Israelite, and that couenant wherein God promiseth to forgiue and forget sinnes, being made with the house of Israel, what claime can I make to that promise? euen none at all.

But this must moue vs to haue the more compassion, and to take the more paine, to see if God

at the last will send comfort and sauing health.
               Thou thinkest that this promise of forgiuing and forgetting sinnes doeth not pertaine vnto thee, because it was made with the house of Israel, and thou art neither Israelite in the flesh nor by promise, but takest thy selfe rather worthy to be esteemed an Egyptian, a Cananite, an Edomite. And if thou wilt, a Dog, and what soeuer other name thou canst remember or deuise. And yet I will shew and proue, that this promise made with the house of Israel pertaineth vnto thee.

And when this answere, which thou art so much afraid of, comming but from thine owne mouth, could not, though it came from the mouth of Iesus, checke that boldnes and confidence of spirit in which she came, but that she still continued her sute, hee dealt more roughly with her, and signified vnto her inplaine words, that he made no other account of her then of a Dog, in comparison of the children of God, to whom the bread of Gods mercy, by the hands of the sauiour, is to be broken, saying vnto her. It is not good to take the childrens
                  Mat. 15. 26. 
                  bread, and to cast it to whelpes. That is, I were not fit to haue the gouernment of Gods house, if the mercy, which is the portion of his children, I should cast away among Dogs, such as thou art. Tell me what thy heart can obiect against thy selfe, to exclude thee from the common

wealth and house of Israel, and to cut thee off from being partner in that promise for forgiuenesse of sinnes, or in any other promise of God what soeuer, that is not here obiected by the Lord Iesus Christ against this Cananite, to exclude her from all hope of obtaining any mercy at his hands. He denies her to be of the house of Israel, hee doeth not acknowledge her to bee a sheepe of his fold, and in plaine termes, to the vnderstanding of all that heare his wordes, he placeth her among Dogs rather then among children. And this is it, that thou chargest thy selfe to be, and therefore secluded from hauing any part in that promise.
               But that poore woman would not be answered so, but still she persisteth in praier: and knowing & beleeuing that Iesus the sonne of Dauid was able to infranchise her, and make her a Citizen & member of the common wealth of Israel, and to change her, and of a Dog, to make her a sheepe of his folde, yea a child of Gods familie, shee intr

And to maintaine in her such faith and such feruencie, shee had no promise so particularly answering the euill that oppressed her heart, as that promise doeth particularly and most aptly answere to the euill, that lieth so heauily vpon thy conscience, onely shee had heard that Iesus had helped others. And this her inforced importunitie, and (as a man would thinke) her vnreasonable and vnmannerly soliciting, preuailed for her, and she obtained all that mercy that her soule desired. What shall I say then vnto thee, that so foolishly vrgest against thy selfe, the shadow of thine owne suspicion, and thine owne fantasticall feare: and refusest to call for that mercy, that God hath alreadie promised to grant? a Cananite and a dog (neither Israelite, nor sheepe, nor child) preuaileth, and thou, discouraged onely by thine owne conceit

But for thee to denie thy self to be such an one, is not good, nor to be maintained, for art not thou descended of Christian parents, and thereby a Cittizen with the Saints, and a child borne within the houshold of faith. And an holy one from the wombe: the Apostle Paul, speaking of the children of beleeuing parents, hath these words. Else were your children vncleane,

Wherein he doth pronounce them to be holy, that is, to haue a title to the couenāt of grace, and to all the priuileges of the Church, and therefore to be of the house of Israel. And this is their birth-right, & their iust inheritance, if either the father or the mother be a right beleeuer, though the

other parent bee an infidell: but both thy parents made profession of the faith of Iesus Christ, therefore this birth-right on both sides is confirmed to thee, and who shal denie him to be a true Israelite, that is borne holy, being of that Holy

And this affliction, which now lieth so heauie vpon thy conscience is nothing else then the calling of God, seeking by this trouble to bring thee home vnto himselfe, that hast so long in in thy former securitie gone astray from him: and therefore that promise of forgiuing iniquitie, and not remembring sinne, and all other promises of his mercy, are made to thee, and doe belong vnto thee, as to a true Israelite, thou being the child of such parents as did inherite the same promises before thee, and thou being also by thy afflictiō called of God.

You know the words of Iohn the Baptist, spoken to the prowd Iewes, that gloried so much in this, that they were Abrahams seed, and in Abrahams right were heires of the Couenant. Hee spake thus vnto them, Say not within your selues, we haue

                  Abraham to our Father, for I say vnto you, that God is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham. So that of him, that is no Israelite, that is no child, that is no heire, God is able to make an Israelite, a child, an heire. Of Gods goodnesse toward them that were no Israelites, and no people, the Prophet Hosea speaketh in this manner, I will

If thou wert therefore of that company that is not pitied, thou maiest yet find mercie at GODS hands: and if thou wert of that company that is not Gods people, thou mayest yet become one of his. The feare therfore that thou fainest vnto thy selfe hath no ground.
               Consider him whom thou hast to deale withall, and hope in his mercie, that is so liberall in his promises, and is also most faithfull in the performance of his word. Thou hast sinned, and hee hath promised to forgiue thy sinnes. Appeale vnto his promises, he cannot faile to effect that which hee hath giuen his word for: of which word of his, himselfe saith thus, It shall not returne vnto mee void, but it shall accomplish that which I will, & it shall prosper in the thing

                  whereto I sent it. So that, hauing sent forth that gracious word of promise, to forgiue and forget thy sinnes, it shall not returne to him void, it shall not be found a false or faulty word, but a word

of truth and power. Pray vnto God for the effect of it, and it shall prooue prosperous to thy peace.

                  worke iniquitie. The way that leadeth to death & destruction is broad and easie, and many walke in it, and perish, & I am one among others, that haue run in that way, and I am yet in it. But the way that leadeth to life and saluation is a narrow way, and few do find it: and I am one of them that cānot find it, I am now out of it, and indeed neuer had any pleasure to seeke it, that I might walke in it. And yet you make the promise of the forgiuenesse of sinnes to be very large, and giuen to al within the church. And why may not I, notwithstanding so gracious & large a promise, misse of forgiuenes, and fall into condemnation, aswel as others? yea before many thousands of others? hauing deserued condemnation as worthily as any other, and moreworthily then many other? therefore I think that there is something required to the obtaining of forgiuenesse of sinnes and

saluation, that I yet know not, and not knowing it, it is very like I haue it not, and not hauing it, I remaine still vnder cōdemnation, and must perish eternally. And I feele it so in the feare of my soule, for notwithstanding all that you haue spoken to put life and hope into my soule, yet the burden of my sinnes, and the feare of damnation is no lesse heauy vpon me, then before you began to speake vnto me. I confesse indeede that the things that haue beene spoken, offer great comfort, but I want a right hand to take it withall. Help me therefore thorow, and shew me what are the conditions vpon which God forgiueth sinnes: that hearing them, I may know whether I bee capable of that desired happines: and if I be not presently, that yet I may indeuour in time to be, and so at the last obtaine it. For though you haue not deliuered me from al my fear, yet you haue wrought in mee a great desire to recouer, and get out of it, not without some hope, that it may one day, by the mercy of God, bee happily effected to my saluation.
               This obiection is tempered with some

mildenes, and while the storme is somethingHis obiection answered. laid, hearken, and I will teach thee what the conditions are: so shalt thou know, both why others perish in their sinnes, notwithstanding this promise, namely by neglecting these conditions: and also, how thou maiest obtaine forgiuenes of thy sinnes, according to this promise, by the obedient and carefull keeping of these conditions.
               The conditions required at our hāds,Conditions vpon which God keepeth promise to forgiue sinnes. if we thinke to obtaine forgiuenesse of sinnes, are in number three. The first of these three concerneth our selues and our renouation. It is called repentance; a departure from sinne, and a returne to God in holines and righteousnesse: for it is meete for him that would haue his sinnes past to be forgiuen him, to cease from sinne, and hate the works of darknesse, wherein he tooke pleasure before. Which ought to be hated, first in regardRepētance is the first condition. of God, because they are displeasing to him that is most holy, and hee that is most glorious is dishonoured by them: Secondly, they are to be hated in regard of our selues, because they cast vs out of Gods loue, into his iust hatred, and

robbing vs of true peace, doe fill our hearts with feare and horrour. And for thine owne part, I hope thou findest that the workes of darkenesse are to be hated, and hast a will also to hate and abhorre them, seeing what wofull feare and danger they haue brought thee into. And this repentance, and turning to God, will surely deliuer thee from thine old sinnes, so that they shall neuer bee laied to thy charge. It is a true saying of Saint Augustine, Non nocent
                  Serm. 181. de Tempore 
                  peccata praeterita, si non placent praesentia: Sinnes past hurt vs not, if sinnes present please vs not. If wee take no pleasure in vnrighteousnesse from henceforth, God will put away and abolish all our old offences. And this saying of his is groū
                  ded vpon the Scripture, which must be thy stay before all the sayings of men. The Prophet thus speaketh, If the wicked
                  Ezec. 19. 2

                  will returne from all his sinnes that he hath committed, and keepe all my statutes, and doe that which is lawfull and right, he shall surely liue, and shall not die: all his transgressions that hee hath committed, shall not be mentioned vnto him. Yea vpon our repentance, and ceasing from

sinne, where it had stained as deepe as Scarlet, and like Crimson double died, in a colour not easie to bee changed, yet there will God clense the sinner, and make him as white as snow, & as cleane as the fleece of wooll new washed and skowred. Reade to this purpose the wordes of Esay in his first Chapter. 16▪ 17 and 18. verses; it is a place of much comfort.
               And when thou hearest repentance toGod helpeth vnto repentance. be a condition of the obtaining of forgiuenes of sinnes, be not discomforted in the conscience of thine owne weakenes, and insufficience of keeping the law of God, as if it should be impossible for thee to obtaine forgiuenes vpon this condition. I know thou canst not but be vnapt for good workes now at the first, hauing so long before accustomed thy selfe to a contrary course of vngodlinesse. But attempt with resolution to reforme thy waies, and studie withall thy heart to serue God according to his will in his word reuealed. God esteemeth the will for the worke: yea hee will worke in thee both to will and to doe of his owne good will, for hee giueth repentance

as well as remission of sinnes by Iesus Christ, whom he hath appointed and inabled therevnto. As Peter saith of him. Him hath God lift vp with his
                  Acts. 5. 31. 
                  right hand, to be a prince and a sauiour, to giue repentance to Israel and remission of sinnes. And therefore (as a good degree of casting thy burden vpon God) pray vnto God to giue thee repentance for thy sinnes, that thou maiest also obtaine forgiuenes. And learne of Dauid to say vnto God, Create in mee a cleane heart
                  Psal. 51.

                  O God, and renue a right spirit within me. And craue it in hope, for God hath liberally promised to giue it. Thus he saith by the Prophet. Then will I poure cleane
                  Ezeki. 36. 25. 
                  water vpon you, and you shall be cleansed. yea from all your filthines, and from all your idols will I cleanse you: a new heart also will I giue you, & a new spirit wil I put within you: I will take away the stonie heart out of your body, and I will giue you a heart of flesh, & I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walke in my statutes, and yee shall keepe my iudgements, and do them. What is it that belongeth vnto repentance, either in the inward man, for the renewing, and humbling, and sanctifying

of the heart: or in the outward man, for the altering, amending and reforming of the life, that God in these words doth not promise to giue. And what he promiseth, that will hee truely giue, if thou make suite vnto him, as it is fit and necessarie for thee.
               The second of the three conditionsCharitie to our brother is the second condition. concerneth our brother, and the mercifull vsing of him, and it is a milde kind of charitie, by which we must be willing to forgiue vnto our brother all the wrongs & trespasses that hee hath done against vs, seeking if we can to reforme him, but not to shame him; yeelding to doe all offices of mercy and loue vnto him in his necessitie: not seeking to be reuenged, and to render euill for euil & rebuke for rebuke. And this is agreeable to iustice and equitie, that if thou wouldest receiue what thou wantest, thou shouldest be willing to supply the want of others as thon art able: and if thou wouldest finde mercy with God, thou shouldest shew mercy to men: for what measure we meate to others, the same shall be meat to vs. Iames the Apostle saith; There shall be iudgement merciles to him

                        •…
                     y reioiceth against iudgement. If thou wilt not remit vnto thy brother, then looke for no remission at Gods hand: but if thou charitably remit vnto thy brother, then cheerefully promise thy soule remission at Gods hands. Verie clearely to this purpose speaketh the Lord Iesus, saying; Mat. 6. 14. 
                  If you doe forgiue men their trespasses, your heauenly father will also forgiue you: but if you doe not forgiue men their trespasses, no more will your father forgiue your trespasses. This text is plaine and needeth no interpretation, but forgiue & it shall be forgiuen to you: forgiue vnto men, and you shall be forgiuen of God.Reasons why wee should redily forgiue our brother.
               
               At the hearing of this condition there needeth no discomfort arise in thy conscience, from feare of thy insufficiencie, for all resteth in thy will. It is no more but this, be willing, & the work is done; desire not to be reuenged, and thou hast forgiuen him: continue kindnesse vnto him, as if no such wrong had beene done vnto thee, and this condition is fulfilled.Reasons why wee should redily forgiue.
               
               And if thou thinke, it will be hard vnto thee, by reason of thy froward heart,

heare a few reasons that may moue thee to thinke, that it is a matter of nothing, considering what thou desirest to obtaine of God. First, it is not much that
                     
                        •…
                     
                   thou hast to forgiue thy brother, small & few are his wrongs done to thee: but it is infinite that thou seekest forgiuenes of from God, many and grieuous are thy wrongs done to him. Secondly,
                     
                        •…
                     
                   betweene thy brother and thee there is no such difference, with aduantage of dignitie on thy selfe, that thou shouldest disdaine in regard of thy excellencie to put vp wrong at thy brothers hand, for thou (as hee) art no better then dust and ashes: but infinite is the difference betweene God and thee, with all aduantage of full excellencie on Gods side, he being of infinite glorie and maiestie, so that hee might iustly disdaine to put vp wrong at the hands of such a vile worme as thou art. Thirdly, thy brother is, neither3 by subiection to thy authoritie, nor by kindenesse receiued from thee so bound vnto thee, that in his doings, which thou interpretest for wrongs, he can be challenged of any great rebellion, and any grosse vnthankefulnes against

thee: but thou, both by subiection to the authoritie of God, and by daily blessings receiued from God, art so bound vnto him, that in thy sinnefull deedes done against his knowne commandements, thou art euidently guiltie of high treason and rebellion, and most wicked vnthakfulnes. Euery of these reasons doe inforce vpon thy heart (be it neuer so froward and swelling) that it is a trif
                     •…
                  e and matter of noe worth, for thee to forgiue the wrongs of thy brother done to thee, if thou desire and expect that God should forgiue vnto thee thy wrongs done against his diuine maiestie. But in the fourth place, marke4 well this, & let it enter into thy froward heart, if thy peace were presently setled, and thou hadst receiued from God as cleare and as assured discharge of all thy sinnes, as Dauid had, when Nathan said vnto him from God. The Lord hath
                  2. Sam. 12. 13. 
                  done away thy sinne, thou shalt not die. Crueltie against thy brother reuoketh Gods promise, which hath euer included in it, this condition of shewing mercy to thy brother, and forgiuing him. It is a true saying of Saint Augustin. Redeunt

                  Ser. 2. de ser Domini super montem 
                  non est. The sinnes forgiuen returne againe where there is no brotherly charitie. And this is plaine in the parable of the king and his seruant, that ought him ten thousand talents: the king being humbly intreated, forgaue him the debt (that is, promised to forgiue it him:) this seruant went forth, and met with a fellow seruant that owed him an hundred pence, and cruelly hee cast him into prison, which when the king heard of, hee was highly displeased, and calling this vnmercifull seruant before him, hee said vnto him. O euill seruant, I forgaue the

                  all that debt, because thou praiedst mee: oughtst not thou also to haue had pittie on thy fellow, euen as I had pitie on thee So his master was wroth, and deliuered him to the gailer, till he should pay all that was due to him. His vnmercifull dealing with his follow, to whom he would not forgiue small offences, reuoked the liberall promise of Gods most large mercy for the forgiuenes of his many and grieuous sinnes: therefore suppresse all frowardnes of thy swelling heart, and after the councell of Salomon, say not, I will do
                  Prou. 24. 29.
                  
                  to him, as he hath done to me, I will recompence euery man according to his worke. But be curteous, mercifull, and tenderhearted, forgiuing thy brother, and so God will gratiously forgiue thee.
               There is a third condition to bee obseruedFaith in God is the third condition. of them that thinke to obtaine forgiuenes of sinne, and that concerneth more directly God, and his glory and praise, namely faith in God, faith in Iesus Christ the sonne of God. That is, firmely to hold perswasion of the mercy of God, that it reacheth to the forgiuenes of sinne, without exception of any sinne, or any sinner; as if for sinne, there were any greater then his mercy, and therefore such as hee neither would nor could forgiue: and for the person, that there were any so farre out of fauour, that vpon his repentance God would not & could not be mercifull vnto him:Micha. 7. 18. the Prophet Micah saying of God for his mercy in this point; Who is a God like vnto thee, that taketh away iniquitie, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? hee retaineth not his wrath for euer, because mercy pleaseth him: he will turne againe, and haue compassion
                  
                  on vs. He will subdue our iniquities, and cast all their sinnes into the bottom of the sea. And firmely to hold perswasion of the merit and vertue of the death and bloud sheding of the Lord Iesus Christ, that it is effectuall to take away the sinne of the world, as Iohn Baptist saith of him, Behold the lambe of God, that taketh
                  Iohn. 1. 29 
                  away the sinnes of the world. Without exception of any sinne, or of any sinner, as if for the sinne, there were any so grieuous, that the bloud of Iesus Christ were not able to wash out the staines thereof: and for the sinner, that there were any so wicked, that the sacrifice of the sonne of God were not sufficient to make attonement with God for him: the Euangelist Iohn concerning sinne saying, The bloud

God to hold this intire parswasion of the merit of his precious bloud and bitter passion, without making exception; which none can truely make. And this intire perswassion without exception includeth particular application, for he that excepteth no sinne excepteth not his owne sinne, a

Of the vertue of this faith to obtaine forgiuenes of sinne, and all other graces at the mercifull hand of God, & for the merit, and by the vertue of Iesus Christ the mediator, these and many other places of Scripture doe speake fully and plainely: Whatsoeuer ye shall aske in praier, if ye beleeue,
                  Mat. 21. 22 
                  ye shall receiue it. And in another place, If thou beleeue, all things are possible
                  Mar. 9. 23. 
                  to him that beleeueth. These things are spoken by the Lord Iesus himselfe. And Saint Paul saith, Beleeue in the

Credulitie to thinke this or that to be true, because some bodie tels vs so, or because we haue reade it, or because we so thinke of it, is one thing: but faith to rest vpon Gods promises for the forgiuenes of sinne is another thing. The first, namely credulitie, when men are light of beleefe, is a sault and infirmitie of nature; the second, namely faith, whereby all accusations are auoided, & all the fiery darts of the diuell are quenched, is the vertue of the spirit, and meerely the gift of God. The Apostle Paul saith, By grace yee are saued through
                  Ephe. 2. 8. 
                  faith, and that not of your selues: it is the gift of God. Yea the same Apostle makes it a worke of no lesse power of God, to bring a sinfull man vnto this sauing faith,

then it was to raise Iesus from the dead, as appeareth by his words written to the Ephesians, where hee praieth for the opening the eies of their vnderstading, that they might know, what is the exceeding

So that if any man be able to raise vp the dead, & quicken them if he lift, then he is able to beleeue vnto saluation if hee lift; and else not. Surely faith vnto saluatiō is not in the power of man to take vnto himselfe at his pleasure, & when he lusteth.

And seeing the chiefestPartly by the study of the word. meanes whereby God worketh faith, is his word, euen the word of the Gospel, which therefore the Apostle calleth the word of faith; that is, the word begetting faith, the word in which, and by which wee beleeue, saying; The word
                  Rom. 10. 8. 
                  is neere thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thy

Therefore giue thy selfe to the study of the word, heare it, reade it, meditate in it: there shalt thou finde the sweet promises of mercy: there shalt thou find Iesus the Mediatour, in whom all the promises of God are, yea, and amen; there shalt thou finde assurance for thy soule, to bring it to true rest. For thy priuat reading, and what thou shalt gaine thereby, heare the saying of our blessed Sauiour, Search the Scriptures,

                  for in them you thinke to haue eternal life, and they are they which testifie of mee: There shall we find the true knowledge of Iesus Christ, and eternall life.

In which words he giues thee to vnderstand▪ that that faith, which is the condition that wee doe speake of (if it were wanting) is obtained by hearing the word of GOD, as by that ordinarie meanes which God hath appoynted to bring the vnbeleeuing Gentiles thereby

to the faith of Iesus Christ, as somewhat more fully he shewed in the same place before, saying. How shall they

                  uation. First hee putteth the word of reconciliation into the mouth of some chosen Messenger, and sendeth him to preach, without which sending he could not goe: then by his preaching, these ignorāt & vnbelieuing come to heare the word of faith & saltion, without which preaching they could not heare: Thirdly, by that hearing he worketh in them knowledge & faith in the Redeemer, without which hearing, they could neither know nor beleeue: Then lastly, by that faith are they imboldened to pray vnto God, without which faith they could haue no courage nor comfort to pray. And vnto their praiers growing from that

faith is saluation giuen, according to a saying of the Prophet Ioel, which the Apostle alledgeth, Whosoeuer shall call
                  Ioel 2. 32. Rom. 10. 13 
                  vpon the name of the Lord, shall be saued. So that thy diligence in hearing the word of God with gladnesse of heart, will helpe thee to faith, and by faith to forgiuenesse of sinnes, which is saluation of soule. And for thy meditating in the word of God, and what benefit thereby thou shalt obtaine, the Prophet Dauid teacheth thee in the first Psalme, where he pronounceth him to be a blessed man, that hath his delight in
                  Psalm 1. 2. 
                  the Law of God, and in his Law meditateth day and night. Diligent moditating in the Law of God maketh a man to be blessed, but blessednes comprehendeth the forgiuenesse of sinnes, that followeth faith, the same Prophet saying, Blessed
                  Psal. 32. 1 
                  is he whose wickednesse is forgiuen, and whose sinne is couered: blessed is the man vnto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquitie. In one word, to shew thee fully how auaileable to the obtaining & increase of faith, the studie of the Gospel wil be, the reading, hearing, and meditating thereon, consider the saying of Saint

                  Paul writing to the Romans; I am not
                  Rom. 1. 16 
                  ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God vnto saluation, to euerie one that beleeueth, to the Iew first, and also the Grecian: for by it the righteousnes of God is reuealed, from faith vnto faith, as it is written, the iust shall liue by faith. It is the doctrine of faith for Iew and Gentile: it breedeth, nourisheth, and increaseth faith, bringing it forward by degrees vnto full ripenesse: it iustifieth the beleeuer, and saueth the iustified man, and effecteth these things powerfully as the instrument of God, for hee calleth it the power of God to saue, that is, the instrument by which hee powerfully saueth. Though therefore thou hast not power to settle thine own hart, by giuing saith vnto thy selfe, yet thou hast no cause to be discomforted; for by praier vnto God, and by study in the word of GOD, it is obtained at his hands.
               These are the conditions betweeneThe three conditions repeated. God and man, which God requireth, where he forgiueth sins: three in number. One that concerneth most directly thy selfe, that is repentance, renewing

thy heart to hate sinne, and to loue vertue, and reforming thy life, to slie sinne and practise vertue. A second that concerneth most directly thy brother, that is, charitie and compassion to forgiue vnto him the wrongs done vnto thee, & to comfort him, and to doe good to him, as thou wouldest that God should forgiue vnto thee the wrongs that thou hast done vnto him, that God should comfort thee, and doe good vnto thee. A third that concerneth most directly God himselfe, reuealed vnto vs in his sinne Iesus Christ, namely, our faith, that wee neither thinke basely of the mercy of God, nor of the merite of Iesus Christ, as if there were some person that it could not releeue, and thy selfe that person; and some sinne that it could not do away, and thy sinne that sinne.
               And now maiest thou vnderstandOthers perish for not obseruing those conditions. what it is that causeth so many to perish in their sinnes, and how it commeth to passe, that so few are saued, when yet without exception of any sinne, the Lord Iesus commandeth, and by commandement giueth leaue to aske, and hope to obtaine forgiuenesse of sinne;

and likewise, without exception of anie sinne, God the

                  e of repentance to forsake sinne, yea with delight they dwell in it, liue in it, and die in it: and they will rather forsake God, and renounce heauen, then leaue their pleasant and gainfull sinnes. Secondly, they haue no care of charitie and compassion to their neighbour, they regard not the rest, the credit, the prosperitie, the peace and safetie of their neighbour: and being full of pride, of wrath and furie, they prosecute the least wrong, till they be reuenged. Thirdly, they regard not to know how ample the Lords mercie is: and the death of Christ, and doctrine of saluation are foolishnesse to them: they pray not for faith, and they stoppe their cares against the word of God. And hereby it commeth to passe that they perish in their sinnes: not that their sinnes are so great that they cannot bee pardoned, or God so mercilesse, that he will not pardon them, or Iesus Christ so defectiue in his mediation, that he hath not done and suffered enough to discharge

them, but themselues are so carelesse, so prowd, so contemptuous, so desperate, that they will not leaue to sinne, they will not loue their neighbours, they will not know God, but they will goe on in their courses, like them whom Ieremie complaineth of, saying, They are all adulterers, and an assembly
                  Ierem. 9. 2 
                  of rebels, and they bend their tongues like their bowes for lies, but they haue no courage for the trueth vppon the earth, for they proceed from euill to worse, & they haue not known me saith the Lord. This is the cause why they perish.

First, forsake the sinnes that haue been so chargeable vnto thee, and hauing already found the reckoning to be so heauy vnto thee, diet no more at the Ordinarie of fleshly lusts, where the soule must pay for it in hell, and the inheritance waste that God hath dearely bought for thee. And finding

how great need thou hast of mercie and forgiuenesse, to keep thee from being eternally miserable. Learne to bee tender hearted toward thy brother, and afford him thy forgiuenesse, that thou maist obtain the same measure of mercy at the hands of God. And let it bee the chiefe of thy daily studies, to vnderstand more cleerely then yet thou dost, how infinite and boundlesse the mercie of God, and the merit of Christ his bloud is. In the word of God thou shalt finde these things. And while thou are occupied with desire in these studies, faith in the mercies of God will grow apace, and in a short time bring thy conscience to that happy quietnesse, that S. Paul speaketh of, saying, Being iustified
                  Rom. 5. 1 
                  by faith, wee haue peace toward God, through our Lord Iesus Christ. Thus is thy feare, growing from the multitude of them that perish, and from the small number of them that are saued (notwithstanding the commaundement of Christ, giuing leaue to aske forgiuenes, and the promise of GOD offering forgiuenesse) shewed to bee an idle feare, if thou wilt haue care of these conditions,

vpon which God granteth forgiuenesse of sinnes.

For first, I want repentance, sinne aboundeth in me, and whether I hate it or no, I cannot tell, though I know I haue no cause to loue it, that proueth now so grieuous vnto me. And secondly, I hold my selfe to be void of loue to my neighbour; I feare least I shall enuie other men their happy peace of conscience, and their happy hope of saluation: and that standeth not with loue. And sure I am that I haue hurt them oft with the vniust act of my sinne, and haue grieued and offended them with the vngodly example of my

sinne. And these things haue no agreement with loue. And as for faith, of all three it is furthest off. If dispaire could obtaine forgiuenes of sinne, I should soone speed, for I am not far from that; but if saluation must be apprehended by saith, I am most far from it; for I haue litle or no faith, the present feare that I am in, is directly opposite to faith.

                  First thou maiest haue all these things,Thou maist haue them, and not know it. and yet not know it, and therefore it is great rashnes to say thou hast them not. For as before this time thou wilt confesse▪ that there was in thee wickednes of life, enuie against thy neighbour, and infidelitie against God, and yet then when it was so, thou didst not thinke it to be so, nor couldest be induced to beleeue it to be so; so at this time, there may be in thee repentance, and charitie, and faith, and yet in this astonishment of thy soule thou canst not see it to be so. Securitie at that time, suffred thee not to see what was amisse in thee: and feare at this time, suffreth not thee to see what is good and orderly in thee.
               Againe if thou haue them not, yet thouThou art not far from them. art in the way of them, and thou art not far from them. Thou art grieued to finde thy selfe guiltie of so much sinne, and thy heart is pricked, and thy soule is wounded to thinke that thou art so laden with thine iniquitie. Surely this is the beginning of true repentance, when a man is grieued at the sight of his sinne▪ Indeed it is loue that commendeth vnto God our repentance and conuersion to

him, but it is feare, that first openeth the heart vnto God, whom being once entred, we doe after intertaine with loue: so was it with Peters hearers in the Acts. After he had brought them to the fight of their sinne, in crucifying the Lord of life it is said of them. When they heard it,
                  Acts. 2. 37. 
                  they were pricked in their heartes, and said vnto Peter, and the other Apostles, men and brethren, what shall we doe? Then began they to haue care of amending their life, when they saw the errour of it, and were afraid at the fight of it. And it is a true saying of Saint Gregorie, Sancta electorum

The holy Church of Gods elect beginneth the waies of her simplicitie and vprightnes in feare, but doth perfect them in loue. So that euen this feare that thou art in, by reason of thy sinnes, is the beginning of repentance, giuing thee to vnderstand, that it is not good, nor safe to continue in them. Proceed in the feare of God, for thou art not far from repentance. And thou thinkest other men to be happy in their peace of conscience, and desirest to haue fellowship

with them in the fruition of Gods fauor. And is not this loue, or at leastwise a preparation to loue? to haue in admiration the saints of God, to thinke them to be happy that are in his fauour, aboue the condition of other men, that inioy the glorie of the world without Gods loue, and to desire to be vnited vnto them▪ No man can thinke well and honorably of them whom hee hateth, no man can desire to bee ioined in condition and fellowship with them whom he doth not loue, or at least, thinke well of; and therefore this opinion, that thou holdest of them, and of their happines, sheweth, that thou art not far from loue▪ When Balaam, hauing considered the condition of the people of God, both in their life, and death, speake these words▪

Thy present good opinion, that thou holdest of them, and of their happines, is an euidence that thou louest, or art not far from loue. And thou hast a longing desire to recouer the loue of God: thou gladly hearkenest to the report of his mercy, and wouldest thinke thy selfe an happy man, if thou couldest grow to any comfortable perswasion thereof: and doth not the man thus minded follow after faith? was there any more in the man that came to Christ for his son that was possessed of a diuell? when he said vnto him, Lord, I beleeue,

Not so, for though now thou haue them not, yet thou maiest obtaine them, and then forgiuenesse of sinnes, now seeming impossible, will easily bee obtained. They that were borne without them, die with them, and reape the fruit of them, bearing the testimonie of them into the graue (in the sweet peace of their conscience) that neuer brought them, not any preparation vnto them out of the wombe. And therefore hope in the Lord, and pray vnto him, and practise all the good councell, that was giuen thee, when these conditions were first remembred vnto thee.

And thou art a child of the church, bred and brought vp in the bosome thereof, thou art the seed, thou art one of the buddes of the righteous: pray vnto God that giueth repentance, and hath largely promised, and in ti

and maketh them to keepe the vnitie of the Spirit in the band of peace. It is he that hath promised in the Church of Christ, and kingdome of the Messias the rod of the stocke of Ishai, to do this; The wolfe shall dwell with the Lambe, and
                  Esay 11. 6.

By the wolfe, the leopard, the lion, the beare, the aspe & the cockatrice, he vnderstandeth men of prowd & cruell minds, apt to do al hurt, bicause they are void of al loue: by the lamb, the kid, the calfe, the fat beast, the cow, the bullocke, the sucking child, & the new weaned child, he vnderstādeth men of an humble & mild heart, apt to do good, vnwilling to doe hurt, because they are full of loue: by the harmelesse society of these so vnlike people, he giueth vs to vnderstand, that he wil take away from men, their pride,

their fiercenesse, their cruelty, their vnmercifulnesse; and in place thereof, he will giue them humilitie, mildenes, loue and mercie. This is a worke that hee doth, and this hee will doe: pray therfore vnto God, who is loue it selfe, and he wil giue thee a heart to loue thy brother. Faith likewise is his gift, and heeGod giueth saith. himselfe is a most faithfull God, worthy to be trusted, the God of truth, that neither can nor will deceiue them, that according to his couenant and promise of mercy, doe trust in him. The Apostle telleth vs, that faith is his gift, saying, By grace are yee saued through faith, and

Euery good gift, and euery perfect giuing commeth from him, who is the Father of lights: pray him therefore to giue a beleeuing heart vnto thee, and hee will not faile thee. So that if thou haue neither repentance, charitie, nor faith, which are the conditions vppon which God giueth forgiuenesse of sins, yet thou maiest haue them, for GOD doth giue them: pray then vnto God, and thou shalt in due time obtain them. For the want of this triple grace, thou

hast a triple commandement to call for grace, with a triple promise to obtaineMatth. 7. 7 all grace. The Lord Iesus saying, Aske, and it shall be giuen you: seeke, and ye shal finde, knocke, and it shall be opened vnto you. Then aske repentance, and it shall be giuen thee: seeke for charitie and a mercifull heart, and thou shalt find it: and knocke at the gate of heauen for faith, and it shall be set wide open vnto thee. Wherefore is it, that God at this time doth make thee see thy want, but because he would haue thee to call for his help.
            
            
               CHAP. XXIII.
               
                  BVt still obiections ariseA seuenth obiection▪ his heart is euer full of euil thoghts in a trobled conscience, and the poore burdened sinner complaineth that his estate must needs be desperate. For, saith he, I feele a continuall swarme of euill thoughts, in extreame disorder, stirring in my heart. Thoughts against the maiesty of the most glorious Trinitie: thoughts against the veritie of the diuine

and humane natures, personally vnited in the Lord Iesus Christ: thoughts against all the Articles of the Christian saith: thoughts rebellious against authoritie, and seditious against peace: thought malicious against my neighbour, and vnnaturall against my selfe: thoughts vnchristian, vnciuill, inhumane, thoughts monstrous, and fearefull: I tremble to thinke that I haue such thoughts. And these must either spring and arise out of mine owne heart, and then wo vnto so wicked heart. It is like vnto the Inne, vnto which the virgine Mary came with the Lord Iesus in her wombe: there was no roome for her in the Inne, all the Chambers were filled with other guests, she was glad to creep into the stable, and there shee brought forth her first begotten. So, if any come to bring Christ, or any christian thoght into my heart, there is no roome in the Inne, all the corners of my heart are taken vp with other thoughts, they must seeke a resting place else-where, and not with mee. Or if they spring not from mine owne heart, then are they thrust into my heart by Satan, who did thrust

the thought of treason against his master into the heart of Iudas: & then surely the diuell hath alreadie possession of my heart, and either hee sendeth these thoughts, as new inhabitants to dwell there, and to keepe possession of my heart to his vse, as the king of Ashur sent new inhabitants into Samari

                     , to keepe the Citie and Countrie to his vse: or else he sendeth them as so many hagges, and furies (what should I call them?) so may executioners with firebrandes to torment me: and being so fully in his power, it is too late to thinke of deliuerance.
               Now the Lord of hosts help thee, pooreAnswere to this obiection. afflicted soule, and case thee of this burden that presseth downe so heauily. And for thy comfort vnderstand, that if these thoughts arise out of thine owne heartThoughts h
                        •…
                     rt not, if we yeeld not to them. (as they are in thy heart) and grow in the field in which they spring, they are yet but as the first graffe of sinne, and haue neither blade, nor eare, nor fruit to poison and kill withall, if wee take not liking of them, nor suffer our iudgement to be corrupted by them, taking them for rules of truth, and intertaining

them as imbraced opinions, nor suffer our will to be seduced by them; interpreting them as rules and directions to leade vs into action. Iames the Apostle hath an excellent saying to this purpose. Euery man is tempted when hee is drawne
                  Iames. 1. 14 
                  away by his owne concupisence, and is intised: then when lust hath conceiued, it bringeth forth sin: and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death. By concupisence he vnderstandeth the first flattering thoughts, the first euill motions that stir in our hearts, that make the first proposition to our iudgement and will, to trie whether they will take holde or no: and howsoeuer the feeblest euill thought be sinfull in Gods sight, who loueth trueth in our inward affections: and it is an euidence of that sinfull nature that wee bring into the world with vs deserued vnto vs from our first parents, through all the interceding generations: and howsoeuer the same euill thought, being sinfull, deserueth (in the iustice of God) eternall death: yet the Apostle Iames, (looking vnto rules of mercy, and speaking according to those rules) telleth vs, that it is not dangerous

vnto vs, neither bringeth forth sinne vnto death, except a man be inticed, and drawne away by it. For when the iudgement yeeldeth, and is corrupted by it, approuing as good, that that is euill, and approuing as true that that is false: and when the will yeeldeth, and is seduced by it, intertaining the motion with assent and liking: then from the first thought there is a progresse made vnto some sinfull action, and in that action, men continue sometime impenitent vnto death. This is indeed a dangerous course, and if thou giue such way vnto these euill thoughts, and first sinfull motions, that thou allowest their appearance without checke, and sufferest their daily returne without controuling thē, and harknest vnto them with pleasure, or at least, with patience; then thou art (as Iames saith) inticed, and drawne away: and then it is likely that those thoughts will conceiue (by the company of thy will) and bring forth some monstrous birth of sinne; whereunto when thou art once entred, it is dangerous, and doubtfull, whether thou shalt finde grace to returne by repentance or

no. And this first deformed birth of sin bringeth forth another deformed and fearefull birth, namely death. The first of these foule births, namely sinne, is thy shame: and the second of them, namely death, is thy snare and destruction, as the Apostle Saint Paul saith, What fruit had
                  Rom. 6. 21. 
                  you then in those things, whereof you are now ashamed▪ for the end of those things is death. But if at the first apparance of these thoughts and euill motions, thou checke them, and shew thy iust dislike of them, if thou arme thy iudgement and thy will against them, with-holding thy Iudgement from approuing them, by shewing how false and vngodly they bee: and with-holding thy will from assenting vnto them, by shewing how sinfull and abominable they be: if thou vse all diligence to expell them out of thine heart, as thou art able, and callest in better thoughts, to occupie their places, falling into some holy meditation of the glory, the greatnesse, the holines, the riches, the bountie the iustice & power of God: or into some meditatiō of the right worship of god, & of thy duty to him, as thou art a christian by generall calling, or as thou

art bound by any other particular calling among christians, or into some other meditation of the glory of heauen, of the purchase of it for beleeuers by the death of Iesus Christ, of the meanes by which we may come to the fruition of it, and what manner persons in their conuersation they ought to bee, that take themselues to bee coheires with Iesus Christ of that glory. If thou fall into such meditations, when thou art at leisure, or set thy minde vpon thy worke

Certainly those thoughts (though very busie with thee) shall not be able to hurt thee: they shall no more be imputed vnto thee for sinne vnto death, then the motions of P

to help thee to ouercome these swarmes of euill thoughts, as he helped the Israelites to ouercome the swarmes of the Amalekites, Philistims, & other enimies: and that also thou take heed of idlenes, and chiefely, idlenes ioined with solitarines. Idlenes is the sinne to be shunned: solitarines doth but make the

                  dlenes to be more dangerous. But certainely they that are troubled with the assault of such thoughts, to them nothing is more dangerous then idlenes, and want of imploiment for their mindes. Then are they at leisure for the diuell, then are they like the house, spoken of in the Gospell, whereunto the diuell entred.Mat. 1
                        •…
                     . 43 As it is written. When the vncleane spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh throughout drie places, seeking rest, and findeth none: then he saith, I will returne into mine house, whence I came: and when hee is come, hee findeth it emptie, swept, and garnished: then he goeth and taketh vnto him seauen other spirits worse then himselfe, and they enter in, and dwell there, and the end of that man is worse then the beginning. Marke well this saying. Hee found it emptie swept and garnished, that is, hee

found it idle, vnimploied. God was not there with good thoughts becomming his presence; and therefore the diuell entred with wicked thoughts becomming his presence. Where the heart is not carefully manured by the owner thereof to bring forth good thoughts, it will of it selfe, to an idle owner bring forth euill thoughts. It will be like to the field of the slouthfull, that Salomon passed by,Prou. 14. 31

                  f thou doe not open thy heart by thy sloth and other sinnes,

vnto those thoughts, and be prepared for the intertainment of them, as a man waiting at the dore of his house, to open it to those guests, whose entrance hee desireth, or is pleased withall: (for so did Iudas, hee did open his heart to the diuels suggestion by his enuie and couetousnes: for when the woman powred the precious ointment vpon the head of Iesus, and Iudas murmured at the waste, saying, it might haue beene solde for much, and giuen to the poore; and Iesus had defended her fact, saying, she did it to prepare him to his buriall: then presently Iudas, who caried the purse, receiued the almes giuen to his master, & now missed this prey out of couetousnesse and enuy hereupon went presently to the high priests, offring to betray him for a reward, and was as ready to entertaine that thought, as the diuell was to offer it vnto him, and his enuie and couetousnes held open his heart vnto it) if thou by thine idlenes and other sinnes doest not set open thy heart to such thoughts, the offer of them in thy heart▪ is the diuels sinne, and not thine. And if thou repell them, as before hath beene

shewed, they shall no more hurt thee, then the suggestions of Sathan in the wildernes offred to the Lord Iesus did hurt him. What those suggestions were, the Euangelists doe shew, and that the diuell audaciously, like a tempter, did offer them to the Lord Iesus, they also shew: but in what manner they were offred to him, they speake not; as whether the diuell spake them audiblie to his eare, or (which is more agreeable to the nature of the diuell) whether he did speake them spiritually and inwardly to his vnderstanding, hereof they speake nothing. Onely Saint Luke saith, that the diuell did shew vnto Iesus the glorie of the kingdomes of the earth, In the

                  twinkling of an eie. Which sure was a spirituall manner of presenting: and why may we not aswell thinke that he vsed a spirituall manner of speaking? but howsoeuer it was, the diuels worke in thrusting those vngodly thoughts into th

                  e heart, is like that diuels worke, that offred those sinfull motions vnto the Lord Iesus. The diuell sinned therein as a tempter, that would haue drawne another to wickednesse, but the Lord Iesus
                  
sinned not in them; while hee gaue no place vnto them, neither was drawne by them to doe euill, but confuted them by the scriptures, those suggestions were no hurt vnto him. Euen so in those thoughts thrust into thine heart, the diuell sinneth in them as a tempter, that would draw thee to cōmit wickednes, but thou sinnest not in them, if thou giue no place vnto them, and suffer not thy selfe to be drawne by them to doe euill, but confutest them by the scriptures. Surely those thoughts, if thou carry thy selfe thus, shall doe no hurt to thee. Againe let me remember thee to call vpon God for the assistance of his grace against those euill thoughts. And to take heede of idlenes and solitarines, remembring Salomons, Vae soli; woe vnto him that
                  Eccle. 4. 10 
                  is alone.
               
               And here I will also aduise the sinner which is troubled with these swarmes of euill thoughts to confer with some godly and learned Phisition, and to vse his counsell, for there is oft in the assault of such thoughts some mixture of some distemper in the body, which he that is wise in God, & desireth true rest vnto his soule

will not, yea must not be carelesse of.The diuell bath leaue to tempt, not power to ouerthrow.
               
               And whereas in the frame of thy obiection, thou saist, that if those thoughts be the suggestions of Sathan in thine heart, then the diuell hath alreadie possession of thy heart, and thou art fully in his power, & it is too late to thinke of deliuering thee ont of his hand. This is but a false phantasie, the fruit of thine owne feare, without any truth in it, for the diuell hath often leaue to tempt, when he hath no power to ouercome. Thou heardst euen now how hee had leaue to tempt the Lord Iesus in the wildernesse, but he had no power to ouercome him. And thou knowest the historie of Iob. The diuell had leaue to tempt him, and and that was limited leaue: hee was not able to touch a sheepes taile of Iobs, till God permitted him, and hee could not passe a step further then God allowed him: and whatsoeuer he did to Iob, either in his possessions, or in his owne bodie, yet had he no power ouer his mind to make him to blaspheme God, which was the d
                     •…
                  uels cheefest desire, & whereof he had accused Iob before. And thou knowest what Iesus saith of the Apostles,

that the diuell made suite to winnow them as wheat, but hee interposed his praier for them, that their faith might not faile in the most hote and violent temptation. So that the diuell hath no power at all, either to trouble by tempting, or to hurt whom he troubleth. But as God in his holy wisdome giueth him leaue. Malice and desire to hurt aboundeth in that enemy, but power he must obtaine at Gods hands. And in thy selfe thou maiest see it plain by the very maner of thy trouble, that though he haue leaue by these thoughts to tempt thee, yet thou art not wholly in his power: for if hee had power to hurt thee with deedes, hee would not trifle the time with thee, to trouble thee with thoughts: for the diuell euer goeth as farre as

saith, that hee himselfe, and the Ephesians to whom he writeth, walked sometime,Ephes. 2. 2. 
                  according to the course of this world, and after the prince that ruleth i

                      the aire, euen the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience. He sometime preuailed in Paul and the Ephesians further then to molest them with vngodly thoughts, for they walked in their deedes after his course, and yet they were deliuered out of his power, and made the faithful seruants and obedient sonnes of God. Indeed the Deuil is a strong man armed, that to his vttermost power keepeth those things that hee possesseth in peace: But the Lord Iesus saith in the Gospel, When a stronger
                  Luke 11. 22 
                  then hee commeth vppon him, and ouercommeth him, hee taketh from him al his armour wherein hee trusted, and diuideth his spoiles. And this stronger then Satan is our Lord Iesus Christ, wholeadeth euen captiuity captiue, and by suffering death in his flesh, hath destroyed death, as the Prophet speaketh: O death

                      13. 14 
                  I will be thy death, O graue I will bee thy destruction. And him also that had power of death to hurt vs withall, as the

Apostle saith, That hee might destroy
                  Hebr. 2. 14 
                  through death, him that had the power of death, that is, the deuill. And to what end hath he subdued this enemy, but that hee might diuide his spoiles, and set at liberty those whom he held captiue: as it followeth in the same place, That he
                  Hebr. 2. 15 
                  might deliuer all them, which for feare of death were all their life time subiect to bondage. Where wee see deliuerance granted to them that the deuill had possession of, and held in peace, as the spoils that he had taken. And the same may be seene by an other saying of the Apostle writing to Timothy, Instruct them with
                  2. Timot. 2 25 
                  meekenesse that are contrarie minded, proning if God at any time will giue them repentance, that they may know the trueth, and that they may come to amendment out of the snares of the deuill, which are taken of him at his will. Marke it, and make vse of it; those whom the deuill hath taken at his pleasure (are not such men in his power) and whom he hath ins

deliuereth and setteth free, bringing them to the knowledge of the truth, and to amendment of life. And doth it by the milde instruction of Timothie, that is, by the word of the Gospel, vnder the free ministerie whereof thou liuest happily in the bosome of the Church. The power of which word (if thou hearken vnto it) in ouerthrowing the power of Satan, and diuiding his spoiles, we may yet further see by that that is written in the Gospell. The Lord Iesus sent forth seuenty Disciples to preach the Gospel, sending them two and two together: and after their ministerie was fulfilled, the Seauentie returned with ioy, saying, Lord, euen the deuils are subiect to vs
                  Luke 10. 17 
                  through thy name. And he said vnto them, I saw Satan like lightning fall downe from heauen. The preaching of the Gospel is a ministerie of power, it is the strong arme of God to destroy the kingdome of Satan. Where it is preached truely and diligently, the walles of Satans kingdome are vndermined, and when the people hearken vnto it, the deuill is cast out of them, and he falleth with violence

from his soueraignty ouer them, euen sodainly, as the lightning, which breaking forth in the East, is sodainely seene in the Weast. Therefore, if Satan had that full power ouer thee that thou fearest, thy diligent attendance to the Gospel preached, will surely worke thy freedome. Let Iesus Christ therefore find thee a diligent hearer in the Temple, and thou shalt find him a mercifull Sauiour in thy heart, and thou shalt bee freed from all power of that aduersary. And though he trouble thee with many wicked thoughts, yet thou shalt be as a prey plucked out of his pawes. And it pertaineth to the casting of this burthen vpon God, that thou do attend to the preaching of his word. And thereto ioyne thy humble and heartie prayer vnto God, and in due time hee will giue rest to thy soule from these euill thoughts.

                  An eight obiection: the Lawe curseth trās goessours, and he is a transgressor therefore cursed. but hauing his eies fixed vpon the Law of God, and hauing no power to looke vp to the Gospel of peace, out of his feare he makes a new obiection, crying & saying, Doth not the Law of God accurse euery transgressor, that abideth not in all that is written in that Booke to do it? And haue not I broken all the commandements of the law? Yes I haue broken them, in thought, word, & deed, and not onely out of ignorance, weakenesse, or vnaduisednesse, but I haue broken, them boldely, prowdly, contemptuously; therefore sure I am that Gods curse lyeth vpon me, I feele the weight and furie of it, and I am no heire of blessednesse.

of God, lest from thence we might take any direction for the well ordering of our liues: but then hee driueth vs forward after the line of our owne lusts. And then, if we haue any remembrance of God, he onely suffereth vs to thinke vpon his mercy and goodnes, and beareth vs in hand, that we cannot do that euill, which hee will not forgiue, and therefore wee neede not greatly care what we doe; we shall repent in time, and all shall be passed ouer in mercie: & so maketh vs to abuse by contempt, the riches of the bountie, and patience, and long-suffering of God. And if wee haue any occasion to thinke vpon the word of God, he turnes vs away from the Law, and presently thrusteth into our mouths the promises of the gospel, and driues vs vpon that rocke of destruction, that the Apostle Paul speaketh of in these words, What shal we say then?
                  Rom. 6. 1. 
                  shall we continue in sinne, that grace may abound? The Gospel preacheth the mercy of God in Christ, to teach, that where sinne did abound deseruing damnation, there the grace of God in Iesus Christ aboundeth more by the forgiuenesse of

that sinne vnto saluation. Heereuppon manie that abuse the grace of God vnto wantonnesse, doe resolue to commit sinne more abundantly, that so grace in the forgiuenesse of their sinne might more abound. This wicked resolution of contemptuous sinners, hee reciteth with words of detestation, saying, God
                  Rom. 6. 2. 
                  forbid: how shall wee that are dead to sinne liue yet therein? The true condition of a Christian man that shall find grace to the forgiuenesse of his sinnes, is to bee dead to sinne, and no more to hearken to, and to obey the commandement of sinne, then a dead seruant can hearken vnto, and obey the commandement of his master: but to bee aliue vnto God, that is, readily to hearken vnto, and diligently to obey Gods cōmandements, as a liuing seruant hearkneth vnto, and obeyeth the voyce of his master. And if this be the condition of Christians, then how shall they that by their profession are dead to sinne, liue in sinne, presuming that super abounding grace shal deliuer him from all danger▪ But vpon this rocke, in the time of our peace and securitie, doth the diuell seeke to throw

vs, keeping vs from all view and consideration of the Law (when wee haue most need to be brideled by it) and making vs with the wrong hand to take holde of the Gospel, when we haue no need of it, nor skill how to make anie right and holy vse of it: and by this meanes he doth in those dayes of securitie, intangle vs in many sinnes.
               And after, when he hath vs fast in his bands, hauing made vs guiltie of infinit transgressions, then hee seeketh leaue to set our sinnes in order against vs, and to raise vp stormes of feare and terrour in our soules. And this leaue obtained, and these stormes raised, then hee withdraweth the Gospell from before our eies, and suffereth vs onely to gaze in the glasse of the Law, that by sight of our owne deformities, hee might altogether confound vs: and then he suffereth vs to haue no other remembrance of God, but of his iustice and seueritie. Then hee presents him vnto vs such a one as Moses describes him, saying; The Lord thy God is a consuming fire and
                  Deut. 4. 24

conceiue him to be, when they say, Who

Then he telles vs, we haue no right to any of those things, they belong to the Saints, to the righteous, to penitent sinners, not to such bold contemners as wee are. And then he maketh vs obiect against our owne soules, as the troubled sinner heere doth, that the Law without fauour accurseth transgressors, that wee without measure haue transgressed the Law, and that therefore without remedy we are accursed creatures. But let vs see how wee may relieue the affrighted soule of this sinner, and against this obiection, teach him, with comfort, to cast his burden vpon the Lord.

As the tempest by Sea maketh men flie with all speed and skill to safe harbour; and as a storme by land maketh men flie with all possible haste into the house: Euen so the thundering of the Law denouncing curses against transgressors, maketh them with all speed and skill to flie vnto Iesus Christ our Sauiour, who onely is the sure harbour, and house of rest and safetie, to all poore and weather-beaten and distressed sinners. To him truely, and in the first place, belong those words of the Prophet, That man shall bee as an hiding place from the
                  Esa. 32. 2. 
                  wind, and as a refuge for the tempest, as riuers of water in a dry place, & as the shadow of a great rocke in a weary land. And

as hunger and thirst kindle a desire of meat and drinke, and as paine and sicknesse felt and knowne, kindleth a desire of the counsell and helpe of the Physician, so feare and anguish wrought in our hearts by the rigorous sentence of the Law accursing vs, kindleth in vs a desire to slie vnto this man, euen the man Iesus Christ, our hiding place, our refuge, our fountaine of liuing waters, our shadow that refresheth: that in him we might find defence against the storme of curses that the Law powreth downe vpon vs. Be not therefore afraid of the Law, but be aduised by it, and confessing thy sinnes, flie, as the Law compels thee, vnto Iesus Christ, who as the Apostle Peter saith.

Looke therefore from the Law that was giuen by Moses vnto Iesus Christ, by whom grace and trueth are reuealed: behold him sweating in the Garden, till droppes of blood fell from him to the ground: behold him scourged with whippes, and crowned with thornes, till the blood issued from all parts of his body: behold him nailed to the tree, there reuiled most disdainefully by the Priests and all the people: heare him crying out vnder the weight of thy sinnes; and of Gods displeasure indured for them, My God▪ my God, why

                  Gal. 3. 13. 
                  from the curse of the law, when hee was made a curse for vs. For it is written, cursed is euery one that hangeth on tree, that
                  
                  the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Iesus Christ, that wee might receiue the promise of the spirit through faith. Dooth the law thunder out curses, Iesus Christ stepped in betweene the law and vs, and receiued the stroke of that curse vppon his owne head, whereof he gaue all the world assurance, when he humbled himselfe to the death of the crosse, which manner of death was by a particular sentence of the law, pronounced accursed: and why should the law threaten againe the curse of God against thee, which alreadie before, it hath not onely pronounced but executed vpō another for thee? Thou art discharged from the curse of the law, in the curse that Christ sustained for thee: yea thou art so fully discharged of the curse, that in place there of thou art made heire of the blessing promised to Abraham, for so are the Apostles wordes. That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gētiles through Iesus Christ. Now this blessing of Abraham is the firme fauour of God to bee our God, according to the couenant which hee made with Abraham, and his seede after him

               CHAP. XXV.
               
                  ALL that is hitherto spokenA ninth obiection. He cannot pray therefore shall not speed. cannot giue peace to this troubled minde; but as one waue followeth another in the sea, so one feare followeth another in his heart, and

new feares afford new obiections. Now he pleadeth thus against himselfe, I haue no reason to hope for mercy, for I haue no heart to pray for mercy. I want all things that pertaine to true praier.
               First I haue no God to praie vnto, that will lend any care to my praiers. I find this saying of Gods, recorded by Esay,
                  Esay. 1. 15. 
                  When you shall stretch out your hands, I will hide mine eies from you: and though ye make many praiers, I will not heare, for your hands are full of bloud. By bloud he meaneth soule and bloudie sinnes, my hands are full of this bloud, for my sins are many, therefore if I should lift vp my hart with my hands vnto god in the heauens, he will neither behold the stretching out of my hands, nor heare the desires and grones of my heart. Also I find this saying of the Prophet, set down as a rule, that shall stand. Your iniquities haue
                  Esay. 59▪ 
                     
                        •…
                     . 
                  seperated betweene you and your God, and your sinnes haue hid his face from you, that he will not heare. Iniquitie seperateth between God and vs; I am full of iniquitie, therefore there is a wall of seperation shutting him out from mee, and mee from him. And sinne causeth him so to

turne away his face that hee will not heare, but I am guiltie of innumerable sinnes, therefore God hath hid his face from me, and 
                     •…
                  ee will not heare. How then can I pray, seeing I haue no God that will lend any eare to my praier?
               Secondly, I haue no mediator in whose name to pray, and for whose sake I may hope to be heard when I pray. For men and Angels, whom some do make their mediators, are no mediators: the Apostle saith, There is one God, and one
                  1. Tim. 2. 5. 
                  mediator betweene God and man▪ which is the man Christ Iesus. This saying excludeth all other mediators. And the only mediator, the man Iesus is no mediator for me: for I haue denied him, and he hath said, Whosoeuer shall denie me before
                  Mat. 10. 33 
                  men, him will I also denie, before my father which is in heauen. And I am sure that I haue denied him before men, if not in words, because these daies of peace haue giuen me no cause so to doe (which I know I should haue done, if da
                     •…
                  es of persecution had vrged me) yet I haue denied him by my deedes. The Apostle hath this saying of the men of his time, which is most true in mee, They professe
                  Titus. 1. 16.
                  
                  they know God, but by workes they denie him. Hee may bee denied by vngodly workes, but I am ful of vngodly workes, therefore haue I denied him before men. And hauing thus denied him, hee must and will denie me before God. So haue I no mediator.
               Thirdly, if I should offer to pray, I must pray without any promise: but so to doe were to pray idly, for then only doe men pray according to the will of God, and with comfort to be heard in their praiers, when they ground their praiers vpon the promises of God. But I neuer tooke heede to the promises of God, and at this time I cannot call them to remembrance, and if I could call them to remembrance, I were neuer the better, for God is not bound to performe his promises to any, but to them alone, that out of their loue to him striue to keepe his commandements. For Moses thus speaketh of him, Thou maiest
                  Deut. 7. 9. 
                  know, that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithfull God, which keepeth couenant and mercy vnto them that loue him and keep
                        •…
                      his commandements, euen to a thousand generations. If any loue not the

Lord, out of his loue to keepe the commandements of the Lord, hee can make no claime to the couenant of God, or to any promise of his; neither is God bound in his truth and faithfulnesse to performe any promise to him: but such a one am I, that haue not loued the Lord, nor out of loue studied to keepe the commandements of God, but haue broken them all, therefore I haue no promise to ground my praiers vpon, and for that cause I cannot pray.
               Fourthly, I know not how to pray, how to begin, and how to make any proceeding: and if at any time I incline my heart to pray, I am disturbed I know not how, and other thoughts draw away my minde. While I thinke to aske forgiuenesse of sinnes, my minde runneth out into a wilde remembrance of my sinnes, with much pleasure to thinke vpon them. While I thinke to pray for grace to assist mee against the power of sinne▪ the lusts of my heart call backe my thoughts, and I am deuising how I may compasse it to commit sinne, and my will wholy inclineth that way. While I thinke to pray for the inheritance of

heauen, my loue to this world carieth away my minde, and I am studying how I may winne the pleasures and preferments thereof. And euer my good desires that should lead my minde, are crossed and put downe by my bad desires, and I cannot raise vp, or if I raise it, I cannot hold vp my heart to God and holy things with any staiednes, I know what is requisite vnto praier by the Apo
                     •…
                  les words. Pray alwaies with all maner

                        •…
                     . If I pray, it is with my lips, I doe not make supplication in the spirit; and to watch vnto praier, that is diligently to attend with all the powers of my soule, without either drowsinesse, fainting or wandering of my thoughts, is most farte from me. And being so vnskilfull, and so vnable to pray, how can I pray, to preuaile by my praiers?
               And lastly (which is my greatest mischiefe) when I thinke to pray, or when I doe pray, or when I haue praied, there is something within mee, that giueth mee my answer, assoone as I haue praied, and sometime before I haue praied, and I am

farre from attending vpon God, till hee doe giue mee answer, as if I did not pray vnto God, but rather vnto my self. The Prophet Dauid saith, Wait patiently vpon
                  Psal. 37. 7. 
                  God, and hope in him: the meaning whereof I take to be this, when we haue shewed our desire vnto God in praier and supplication, that then we should hope in him to receiue a gracious answer, and wait patiently for that answer, till it please God to shew vs mercy in his appointed time. I doe not so, I haue neither hope nor patience to wait vpon his hand, but mine owne heart maketh answer without God; And that answer is alwaies a negatiue answer, a flat deniall, a plaine repulse. So that I haue lesse hope, and lesse comfort in and after my praier, then before I praied, and where others finde themselues much eased in heart, after they haue by praier powred out their desires into the lap of God, I am much more troubled, esteeming euen my praier to be turned into sinne: all these things together make me most vnable to pray.Answer to the ninth obiection.
               
               This is a grieuous obiection: but in framing this obiection the troubled sinner

                  th he cannot pray, becauseThat hee hath a God to pray vnto. he hath no God to pray vnto, that will lend an eare of hearing to the praier hee makes, because hee hath sinned against God. And yet hee was taught before, that leaue was giuen him, yea that hee was commanded to pray vnto God, euen for the forgiuenesse of those sinnes, that made the separation betweene him and his God: and also that God had promised to forgiue those sinnes yea all sinnes without exception. And whereas he obiected against the commandement of praying for forgiuenesse, that it pertained not vnto him that could not call God his father; and against the promise of forgiuing, that it pertained not vnto him, that was no Israelite. These things were answred and remoued, and it was

clearely proued vnto him that God was his father, and therefore hee might and ought to pray for forgiuesse: and that he was an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, and of the houshold of faith, and therefore God had promised vnto him forgiuenesse of sin. And while these things stand good, how can he say that he hath no God that will heare him, because hee hath sinned against him. Let him remember what Dauid saith vnto God in one of the Psalmes, Against thee, against thee
                  Psal. 51. 4. 
                  onely haue I sinned, and done euill in thy fight, that thou maiest be iust when thou speakest, and pure when thou iudgest. Here is a true confession, that he had sinned against God. Doth hee therefore thinke that he hath no God to pray vnto, that will lend him an eare of hearing? What is that whole Psalme but a praier vnto this God? In the first verse hee praieth thus: Haue mercy vpon mee o God according
                  vers. 1.! 
                  to thy louing kindnesse, according to the multitude of thy compassions put away mine iniquities. In the second verse heevers. 2. praieth thus, Wash mee throughly from mine iniquity, and clense me from my sinne. In the seauenth verse hee praieth thus,

                  Purge me with Hisop, and I shal be cleane,
                  vers. 7. 
                  rash mee and I shall be whiter then snow. And so in many other parts of this Psalme. So that it appeareth by Dauids practise, that our sinners rule faileth, pleading that hee hath no God to pray

heare, because they delight more in sin then they do in God. But the humble, the penitent, the broken-hearted sinner, to whom his sins are his burden, a displeasing burden, from which hee desireth to be deliuered, as our sinner doth this day.

                  of God are a contrite spirit, & a contrite and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. So that thou wert neuer so fit indeede to pray, as now thou art with thy contrite and broken heart; thy praiers now will be a sweet and pleasing sacrifice to him. He is thy God, and wil most readily heare thee.
               Secondly, hee saith hee hath no Mediator,That bee hath a mediator in whose name to pray. in whose name to pray, and for whose sake hee may hope to bee heard. And yet remembreth the words of Scripture that call Iesus the Mediator betweene God and man. Those verie

words prooue thou hast a Mediatour, euen the same Iesus, except thou wilt deny thy selfe to be a man; for hee is Mediator betweene God and man, and therefore mediator betweene God and thee, if thou be a man. So that to say thou hast no mediator in whose name to pray, and for whose sake thy praier should be accepted, is but an vnthankfull speech put into thy head without any good ground; for Paul saith of Iesus, that hee euer liueth to make intercession
                  Hebr. 7. 25 
                  for vs. Yet our afflicted sinner thinketh he hath reason to say so, because he hath denied Iesus before men. And did not Saint Peter deny the Lord Iesus before men? and yet hee after praied and was heard in the Mediators name, because hee stoode not in his deniall, but repented. Yet thou hast not denyed him in words before men as Peter did. That thou thinkest to bee no aduantage to thee, and referrest it to the daies of peace, not vrging thee, rather then to the constancie of thine own heart (thou louest to bee thine owne accuser) and what thou hast not done in words, thou thinkest that thou hast done in workes,

by them thou hast denied him, while thou didst not liue like á Christian. But must it therefore follow, that he is now

He himself when as an vnspotted Lamb he was sacrificed for thee, tooke away, and by the vertue of that sacrifice, still taketh, and euer taketh away thy sinne: where is now that reall deniall of thine, when those sinnes, in which thou didst deny him, are done away?

And without promise to pray vnto GOD, were to make idle and vnstable praiers, That is most true. But who told him that Gods promises, which are made to all, belong not vnto him. This point was handled before, when he obiected, that Gods promise for the forgiuenes of his sinnes, belonged not to him that was no Israelite. And it was then prooued, that all Gods promises belong to the seed of the righteous: the Apostle Peter saying, The promise is made vnto you,

That is, to euery one that commeth humbly and reuerently vnto GOD, in the name of Iesus Christ, seeking mercy and grace, mercy and grace shal be granted according to the promises of God, whose truth pertains to them that are in Christ Iesus, and come vnto God by him.

The sorrow of his heart did so oppresse his soule, that though he remembred God, and looked vp vnto him, and had all his desires waiting vpon the hand of God, yet he was not able to pray in any distinct manner like a wel aduised man, his praying was all out of order, it was more like the mourning of a Doue, and more like the chattering of a Swallow, then like the holy and orderly praiers of a wise and godly man.

                  The wrath of the Lord, and his lealousie shall smoke against that man, and euery curse that is written in this booke shall light vpon him, and the Lord shall put out his name from vnder heauen. On the other side, when men are humbled in the sight of their sins, and haue great remorse in their hearts, if they powre

                  Psal. 145. 14 
                  all that fall, and lifteth vp all that are readie to fall. And in another place. He healeth those that are broken in heart,
                  Psal. 147. 3. 
                  and bindeth vp their sores. Pray thou therefore vnto God in the name of Iesus Christ, and pray with comfort of heart: and when thou hast made request vnto God, accept no answere but from God. First hee answereth comfortably in his word, to all such as thou art, comming vnto him. With that first answere appease thy troubled minde, till God in his rich mercy, by his deed of deliuerance, giue thee a further answer.

I am forsaken of God, I am a lost child, the very sonne of perdition, and I am a reprobate, a far more vile sinner then many reprobates, and therefore you labour in vaine that offer comfort to me, and that take so much paine to answere my obiections: you may well deuise answers before me and other men, but they are vnanswerable before the iudgement seate of God, where I must appeare for my sinne.

If this brunt may be indured and ouercome, I hope peace wil grow speedily, by the blessing of the God of peace. And for answer vnto this obiection, first I say. That if these words had beene spoken by the Lord himselfe, I would haue stood astonished at the hearing of so fearefull a sentence: I would haue kept silence for reuerence of the speaker, and without reply I would haue laied my hand vpon my mouth, and haue glorified God in his iudgements, & I would haue said vnto him as Iob said; Behold I am vile, what

                  shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand vpon my mouth: once haue I spoken, but I will answer no more; yea twise, but I will proceed no further. But I doe vnderstand from whence these words doe come, & from thence I take vnto me comfort of replying; for I find them to arise out of that soile, that breedeth errors and lies. Therefore they are subiect to exception.

                     o be regarded immediate speaker: and against thee, and this speech of thine I haue iust exception.

First, the thing whereof thou presumest to pronounce, is a thing exempted from mans iudgement, and whereof no man hath leaue to pronounce, till God by some euident tokens doe manifest his owne purpose. Three things there are (saith one) which are exempt from mans iudgement. The first is, the word of God, what hee hath spoken, that must stand; man hath no power to iudge it, otherwise then in humilitie to reuerence it. The second thing is, Gods eternal counsell, which is onely knowne vnto himselfe. And no m
                     •…
                  n can say, it is thus, or thus, vntill God by his apparant worke do manifest it. The third thing is, the reprobation of particular men, whereof no man is able to pronounce, nor indeed ought to iudge, either himselfe or any other to be of that number. God saueth and condemneth whom he will, not whom we assigne and nominate. Oft times they are vile in the sight of God whom wee approue and honour, and oft times they are honourable and precious in Gods eies, whom we thinke meanly of. Paul saith of him, He hath mercie on whom he
                  Rom. 9. 18
                  
                  will, and whom he▪ will, he hardeneth. It resteth wholy in the will of God, and it is not as we fancie, thinke, or iudge. Of euery particular man the same Apostle saith. Hee standeth or falleth to his owne
                  Rom. 14. 4. 
                  Master, that is, as God our Maister shall be pleased, either to shew mercie, or to execute iudgement, so shall euery man stand or fall, escape or perish, not as either he himselfe, or any other shall iudge and pronounce of him. Therefore this point of particular reprobation, being exempted from mans iudgement (for God sheweth mercie, and giueth faith and repentance at his pleasure, euen while the thiefe hangeth on the tree) 
                     •…
                  ust exception lieth against this vnkind obiection.
               Secondly, if the matter were such as man might iudge and pronounce of, yet I may without offence (if I see reason for it) deny to credit thy words, because as all men are, so art thou (when thou art in best tune) apt to be deceiued, and prone to receiue, imbrace, and deliuer a li
                     •…
                  . Dauid hath these words in one of the Psalmes, I said in my feare, all men
                  Psa. 116. 11 
                  are liers. And what the Prophet spake

in feare, that the Apostle Saint Paul without feare, and in a freer mind hath confirmed, saying; Let God be true, and
                  Rom. 
                        •…
                     . 4. 
                  euerie man a liar, as it is written. And I am not bound to keepe silence to euerie word that comes from the mouth of a liar, when I haue reason to think otherwise then he speaketh, as I haue at this time to think otherwise then thou speakest.
               Thirdly and lastly, I haue at this time iust cause of exception against thy words, because thy present disease, thy disquietnes of mind, thy feare that thou art in, trouble both thy vnderstanding and speech, that thou canst neither apprehend things as they are, nor pronounce them as thou vnderstandest them. And thou laborest vnder a temptation, directly bent against thy faith, perswading thee those things that are preiudiciall to thy soule. And out of some violent fit of that temptation, thou makest this vnkind obiection against thy selfe. Thus in regard of thee that art the immediat speaker in mine eares, I haue iust libertie to reply against this obiection.
               
                  But howsoeuer thou art in mine 
                     •…
                  are the immediate speaker, yet in my vnderstanding,The diuell being autor of this obiection, it is to be reiected. the words of this obiection haue another, a more remote, and a more dangerous author. The Spirit of GOD which is the Spirite ofIohn 15. 26 trueth, and leadeth into all trueth, is called in the Scripture a Comforter, When the Comforter shall come, whom I will send vnto you from the Father, euen the spirit of truth which proceedeth of the Father, he shall testifie of 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   This spake the Lord Iesus calling 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Holy-ghost, which is the spirit of trueth, a comforter. But the wordes of this obiection sound not like the words of a Comforter, therefore I cannot iudge them to be the words of that spirit that is the spirit of trueth. But there is another spirit, that as the Lord Iesus saith, abode
                  Iohn 8. 4
                        •…
                     . 
                  not in the trueth, because there is no truth in him: when hee speaketh a lie, then speaketh he of his owne, for he is a liar, and the father thereof. To that spirit is the name of Satan giuen, which signifieth an aduersarie, because hee seeketh our hurt, and in all things dealeth with vs as a sworne aduersarie; of whom vnder

the name of an aduersarie Saint Peter warnes vs to take heede, saying; Your
                  1. Pet. 5. 8. 
                  aduersarie the diuell as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may denoure, whom resist stedfast in the faith. And the words of this obiection were neuer put into thy mouth by any friend. And they plai
                     •…
                  ly shew an aduersarie, euen that aduersary to be their author and suggester: who being himselfe eternally forsaken of God, vtterly lost without hope of redemption, and a reprobate Angell, bound in euerlasting chaines vnder darkenesse vnto the iudgement of the last day, would make thee beleeue, that thou also art forsaken, lost, and reprobate in like manner as himselfe. Now such an one, a lier, and an aduersarie, being the prompter of these fearefull things vnto thine heart, thou oughtest not to giue any the least credite vnto them, much lesse to maintaine them against thy selfe. He being a lying spirit, pietie doth teach thee not to beleeue him; and being an aduersarie, wisedome (if thou haueany) persuades to distrust him. And both frō thee the speaker, and from him the author of this vngodly

obiection, I haue much confidence, and am much imboldened to make replie. And against thy vncharitable affirmation, saying, I am forsaken, I am lost, I am a reprobate, I will oppose a more charitable negation, and say, thou art not forsaken, thou art not lost, thou art not a reprobate. And I will see how I can maintaine my saying, and ouerthrow thi

                  e, that thou maiest not be ouerthrowne.
               First, thou saiest thou art forsaken. IfHe may be forsaken for a time, and a

                     ter again receiued to fauour. by this speech thou meanest that now for the present, God hauing laied trouble vpon thee, withdraweth his assisting power and hand from thee, and leaueth thee vnder the crosse to cry and grone, and to take notice of thy infirmitie; in this sense I grant thou maiest bee forsaken. But this is a temporary forsaking, it is not a finall forsaking. And to them that a
                     •…
                  e so forsaken, God after in his time returneth with saluation, & there is hope for them. Hereof let this be an argument vnto thee, that the best seruants of God are in this manner forsaken oft times, and feele themselues so to be, and complaine heauily for it, and

yet after obtaine helpe. So was it with Dauid when he said, My God, my God
                  Psa. 22. 1. 
                  why hast thou forsaken mee, and art so far from my health, and from the words of my roaring? If wee should say that these words were words of feare rather then of truth, it might be with shew of reason maintained, for God was not so far departed from h
                     •…
                  m as he feared: but grant that they were words of truth, and that God was indeed departed from Dauid, and had forsaken him, did not God returne againe vnto him? and had not hee (euen then) hope of Gods returne? did not God receiue him again into his protection, and helpe him? and had not hee (euen then) hope of such helpe from God? that he had such hope of Gods returne to his helpe, hee declareth by his praier vnto God, continued in the same Psalme, where he saith, Be not thou far
                  Psa. 22. 19. 
                  of O Lord my strength, hasten to helpe me. Hee that could thus pray, wanted not hope of Gods returne to his helpe, though hee were for the present forsaken. And that God did returne vnto him, and helpe him according to that hope of his, hee also declareth in that

Psalme, speaking of himselfe, though he vseth the third person as if hee had spoken of others. Hee hath not despised nor
                  Psa. 22. 24. 
                  abhorred the affliction of the poore, neither hath he hid his face from him, but when he called vpon him, he heard. So that though he were forsaken, it was but for a time, when the Lord was pleased (for the exercise of the Prophets faith) to hide his face from him. The Prophet by his praier quickly found him out where he was hidden▪ and at the crie of that praier, he heard and came forth to his succour. I might heere adde the example of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, who hanging vpon the crosse, and being vnder the same temptation for other mens sins, which thou art vnder for thine owne sinnes, vsed the same words that Dauid did, saying. My God, my God why hast thou forsaken
                  Mat. 27. 48 
                  mee? I intreat this afflicted sinnet, hearing the sonne of God complaine that he was forsaken of his father, to tell mee his opinion; whether he thinkes he was forsaken eternally, or was forsaken onely for a time? and whether after this forsaking, God did not returne vnto him, and deliuer him from all his feare?

If hee should answer, that he thinkes hee was eternally forsaken, and that God 
                     •…
                  turned not to deliuer him, and that he was neuer deliuered from his feare; it 
                     •…
                  ere an absurd answer. For the history is plaine and cleare, that though he were forsaken vnto the death, and lest vnto the will of his enemies, and sealed vp in his graue, yet as the Prophet, in his person, had spoken to God before, saying; Thou wilt not leaue my soule in the graue,
                  Psa▪ 16. 10. 
                  
                     
                        •…
                     ither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption. So God dealt with him, hee was not left in the graue, hee did not see corruption; for on the third day, God raised him vp again to life. Forty daies after that hee ascended vp into heauen, euen with his body, and now in all fulnesse of glory and maiesty, he sitteth at the right hand of God. So that his folly would fully bewray it selfe, if he should answer, that Iesus was eternally forsaken, and that God returned not to deliuer him from his feare. And if hee answer (as truth will compell him) that he was forsaken onely for a time, and after inioyed againe, and still inioyeth the fauour of his father: then it will follow

by his owne confession, that all that are forsaken, are not eternally forsaken, and some are onely left for a time to be tried, exercised, and humbled, and after triall taken of their faith, after patience perfected, and true humility wrought in them, hee that had forsaken them, doth gather them againe into his lap, he that had left them to themselues, doth again receiue them into his charge. And why then may not our sinner, that crieth out thus, that he is forsaken of God, suppose himselfe to be onely forsaken for a time.
               And if our sinner, complayning thatHe cannot say that he is eternally forsaken: reasons to the contrary. hee is forsaken, thinketh otherwise, as namely that God hath forsaken him for euer. I answer him, first, that he speaketh foolishly, and out of ignorant feare, that being a matter of Gods secret counsel, where of it is not possible that he should haue certaine knowledge, that hath not so much knowledge as hee should of Gods reuealed will. Let him goe first, and make himselfe better acquainted with Gods reuealed will, let him study to learne and know the promises, the threatnings, the precepts and rules contained

in Gods word. And as for the secret counsell of the Lord, so much as concerneth him to vnderstand, God

                  , hee would not haue laied vpon him this temptation, to make him thereby to see his sinne, and the danger that his sinne bringeth him into: for the sight of these things is a very ready way to repentance, for it maketh a man to bee truly displeased with his sinne, and it

                  ection, hee would haue rocked him asleep in his security with continual prosperity, and much peace (after the manner

of the world) that he might haue had no cause to feare sinne: so long as the prodigall sonnes prosperity lasted, hee neuer thought of returning home to his fathers house. That surely is the way to scale vp sinners in their security, and to keepe them from all thought, or all desire, or at least, from all resolution with speede for to leaue sinne: And so vseth God to deale with them whom hee forsaketh for euer: As Iob obserued, sayingIob. 21. 7. vnto God; Wherfore doe the wicked liue, and wax old, and grow in wealth? their seed is established in their sight with them, and their generation before their eies. Marke in the next words what followeth, Their houses are peaceable, without feare, and the rod of God is not vpon them. They are not troubled with any temptation like thine. Their Bullocke gendereth and faileth not▪ their Cow calueth and casteth not her Calfe. They send forth their children like sheepe, and their sonnes dance. They take the Tabret and Harpe and reioyce in the sound of the Organs. They spend their daies in wealth, and suddenly goe downe to the graue. Thus, for the most part, God dealeth with them whom he meaneth to

forsake for euer. And this continuall prosperity most kindly locketh vp all the powers of their soule in security as in a dead sleepe, that they neuer intend repentance, but are confirmed in their sinne, and in the contempt of God. As Iob in the same place noteth, in the very next words saying; They say also vnto

Thou saiest thou art lost; I heare thee, and I say with thee, the sheepe was lost, the peece of money was lost, the sonne was lost. But what became of them when they were lost? perished they? no: what then? they were found againe: the sheepe was found, and safely put together with the rest in the fold: the peece of money was found, and with the rest was safely laied vp: and the sonne was found, and kindely receiued againe into his fathers house. And canst thou not see in them what is

like to become of thee, that art lost as they were? whatsoeuer is written of that sheepe▪ and of that peece of money, and of that sonne, is all written to teach thee, what thou maiest, and what thou oughtst to pray for and to hope for, perceiuing thy selfe to bee lost. Thou art that lost sheep, and Iesus Christ is the Shepheard and Lord of the flock that seeketh thee: thou art that lost peece of money, & the church, the spouse of Iesus Christ, is that carefull woman, that by the ministrie of the Gospell, as with a light in her hand, searcheth euery corner for thee: thou art that lost child, as thou (but with an euill mind) callest thy selfe, & God in Christ, euen God the father of our Lord Iesus Christ is that most louing and kind father, that is ready to intertaine thee, and if thou wouldest but turne thy steps toward him, hee would meete thee: as it is said of that father, When hee was yet a

senses. For sometime we say a thingThings are said to be lost two mannaner of waies. is lost, when hee that had it in possession or keeping, knowes not what is become of it: the thing in the meane time, beeing perhaps very safe in some vnknowen place, and it is onely lost to him that had it in his keeping, and now knoweth not where it is, and what is become of it, but it is not lost in it selfe. As when some horse or other beast is straied out of thy ground, thou knowest not where it is, and it is in some good pasture of thy neighbour very safe, and not far from thee; and sometime we say a thing is lost, when it is spoiled and perished, remaining still in the possession of him, that had it before in keeping, and he knowes both where it is, and what is become of it: as where thy horse or other beast, being yet within thine owne ground, were fallen into some pit and drowned, or by some other mischance were killed: in both these cases a man saith, I haue lost such a beast. The opposite to loosing, and being lost, in the first sence, is to seeke the thing that is staied, and out of the way, vntill thou find it, and recouer the possession of it. And the

opposite of loosing, & being lost, in the second sence, is to saue the thing that was ready to be spoiled, & to perish.

And this seeker is of that diligence & wisdome that he cannot be disappointed of finding: &

that were lost, to be the onely end (as indeed it was) of his comming into the world. For this cause was he conceiued by the Holy Ghost, for this purpose was he borne of the Virgin Mary, to this end, and for the effecting of this saluation, was the sonne of God made the sonne of man; yea for this, and for this onely, did he fulfill all righteousnes, and yeelded obedience, euen to the death of the crosse, that he might seeke and find them that were gone astray, and that he might recouer and saue them that were lost, so that hee that shall deny these things to be truely intended, and fully performed by Iesus Christ, doeth make idle and fruitlesse the incarnation and passion of our Lord Iesus Christ, and denieth the vertue of the death and bloudsheding of the sonne of God. Let our afflicted sinner consider these things, and set his heart on worke to meditate vpon them, and it will come to passe, that whereas before, the remembrance of his lost estate was cause of heauines vnto him, the same very condition shall giue him comfort and hope, and saue him as an argument to proue him to be

the condition of euery seruant of God in Iesus Christ. And herein he hath cause to looke vp, & to lift vp his head with comfort and ioy. He that in himselfe is a lost sinner, is in Iesus Christ a saued Saint.

This latter speech, namely, that thou art a viler sinner then many reprobates, may be pronounced, beleeued, and graunted. But the first speech, namely, that thou art a reprobate, is neither to bee pronounced by thee, nor granted by me, nor beleeued by any. The name of a reprobate is to be vnderstood with reference, not vnto our naturall corruption, which makes vs all children of wrath and worthy of reprobation, but rather vnto the eternall and secret counsell▪ vnto the iust and holie purpose of God. And therefore the name signifieth not euery man that is a most vile sinner, but him that is ordained by God from euerlasting, to perish iustly in and for his sinne, that God by declaring in him his power and his iustice, may be glorified in the worke of his owne hands, as of right belongeth

But thou maiest not therefore pronounce him a reprobate, for God may giue him repentance, and vppon repentance forgiue his sinne. And what God will doe to

him thou canst not tell; and thou hast more cause to hope of Gods mercie, then pronounce of his iustice so long as this sinner liueth in the Church, and vnder the ministry of the Gospel, where God doth allow the meanes of repentance, and maketh daily offer of forgiuenesse of sinnes. God calleth some in their youth, and some in their age, as the housholder hired laborers to worke in his vineyard, some in the morning and beginning of the day, some at the eleuenth houre, when the Sunne was ready to set.
               Therefore, whereas before in his obiectionThe sinnes of the elect may bee more vile, then the sinnes of the reprobate in our eies. hee had said, that hee was a viler sinner then many reprobates; that was granted to be true, and hee may be so, and yet no reprobate. For oft-times the elect of God doe sinne more grieuously (to the iudgement of man) then thereprobate doe, and after obtaine repentance, which the reprobate doe not. To this end let vs compare together the sinnes of an elect child, and of a reprobate, as the Scripture giues testimony of them. Saul was a reprobate, his end proued him so to bee. Dauid was one of

Saul was commanded to stay the Amalechites, and to destroy them vtterly, both man and beast: in the execution of this iudgement of God, contrary to the commandement giuen him, he saued aliue Ag

                   of this disobedience, how many excuses (reasonable in our eies) might be alledged. First for the sparing of Agags life, it may be pleaded; Agag was a man, and it was humanity to saue a mans life, and being an enemy, it was noble mercy to saue an enemy, the cowardly and ti

If he did out of politike respect, either to teach his owne subiects euer to reuerence the person of a King, or to inrich himself and his kingdome with the ransome

of a King, it was a point of commendable wisdome. Then for the sparing of the fat cattell it might bee said, would you haue had him make war with flockes of sheepe, and heards of kine? That had been rather to play the part of a mad man, then of a noble warriour. And if they must be slaine, was it not better to kill them, some to day, and some to morrow, so as they might be meate for the people of God, then to kill them at once, and so to leaue their carkases to rot and stinke aboue the ground, and to be meate for dogs, and for the fowles of Heauen? And was there not many a poore man in Israel that was not worth a Cow, and many a poore Widdow in Israel that was not worth a sheepe, that might be inriched, at least releeued with this pray? Further, was it not meete that God, who had giuen them a notable victory against their enemies, should be remembred with sacrifices of praise? And this pray would plentifully serue for that holy seruice, so that the Altars of God might smoke with burnt offerings, and yet the people of Israel not be impouerished, or in any

measure burdened with the charge. These and such other excuses in the iudgement of man reasonable, though against an expresse commandement of God nothing worth might be alledged to extenuate the

               Let vs now heare the recorded sinne
                     Dauids sin declared. of Dauid, and consider if any such reasonable excuse may be made to extenuate it, and whether his or Sauls will appeare vnto vs to be the viler sinne. Dauid rose vp from his bed of sloth, whereon he had slept in the heat of the day, and walking on the roofe of his Palace, from thence hee saw a faire woman washing hirselfe in a Garden. Lust that commonly accompanieth sloth, seazed vpon his heart, and hee began to desire that womans company. And inquiring of hir, he learned that she was the wife of Vri
                     
                        •…
                     , a valiant seruant of his, that was now abroad in battell in the seruice of Dauid
                  Exo. 20. 17 against the Ammonites. To hir he sendeth the messengers of his lust: she commeth vnto him: and notwithstanding Gods commandement, whereof Dauid was not ignorant, thou shalt not couet thy neighbours wife, hee did couet hir. And

notwithstanding the commandement, which also he well knew, Thou shalt not
                  Exo. 20. 14 
                  commit adultery; hee committed adultery, and did lie with hir. Shee conceiued by him in her husbands absence, shee sends him word of it. Now Dauid fearing the publike reproch among men that might light vpon him for this soule fact, studieth how to couer it, and sendeth to the Campe for Vriah: entertaineth him kindly all the day, and sendeth him away at night, hoping that hee would goe home to his owne house, and lie with his wife, and so couer the fault that Dauid had made. But Vriah hauing taken leaue of the King, went not home, but like a souldier takes vp his lodging among the Kings Guard, and visits not his wife. The King hearing this in the morning, staies him also that day, and makes him drunke at supper, hoping that being heated with wine, hee would desire to goe home to his wife, but hee againe takes vp his lodging where he did the night before. Then Dauid seeing that this deuice would not helpe him, resolued vpon a more wicked and cruell course, and sends Vriah to the Campe,

and writes by him to Ioab, the Generall, that hee should place Uriah in the forefront of the battell, and in the time of danger should with-draw all helpe from him, and leaue him alone in the middest of the enemies, that he might be smitten and die by their hands. And this commandement was by Ioab fulfilled at the next assault made vpon the City Rabbah, & Vriah was there slaine. Then was his wife a widdow, and free from all men; and Dauid takes her home to him, and shee became his wife. And thus he couered the shame of his first sinne, with a second, as bad, if not much worse. AndNo excuse can be made to extenuate the sin of Dauid.
                   what honest man, that knoweth how he ought to keepe his vessell in holinesse and honour, and not in the lust of concupiscence, as the Gentiles doe which know not God, can frame any reasonable excuse for his adultery? And what sober man, that hath learned to walke honestly as in the day time, not in surfeting and drunkennesse, can excuse his fact in making Uriah drunke? and what charitable man, that tendereth the life of his neighbour, and knowes Gods ordinance, that he that sheddeth mans bloud

by man shall his bloud be shed, can by any good words extenuate the sinne of his rraiterous murder? It may be that wantons, that riotous persons, and bloudy-minded-mercilesse men will say, it was brauely done; but no man of continency, of temperancy and of charity can excuse him. Surely the sinne of Saul and Dauid compared together▪ it appeareth to vs that Dauid sinned more vilely then Saul, in the act of their disobedience, howsoeuer for the heart yeelding to sin, much may be said for Dauid, that cannot be said for Saul. Which difference of their hearts appeared presently, when they were put in mind of their disobedience by the Prophets Samuel and Nathan. For when Saul was challenged by these words of Samuel, Wherefore hast
                  1. Sam. 15. 19. 
                  thou not obe

                     ed the voice of the Lord, but hast turned to the pray, and hast done wickedly in the sight of the Lord? He denied the fact, maintained his deniall with argument, and lastly being inforced to confesse himselfe a transgressour, yet hee did it faintly and neuer repented. But assoone as Nathan had said vnto Dauid,
                  2. Sam. 12. 9. 
                  Wherefore hast thou despised the commandement
                  
                  of the Lord: to doe euill in his sight? thou hast killed Variah the Hittite with the sword, & hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slaine him with the sword of the childrē of Ammon. He confessed it freely, grew into displeasure with himselfe for it, and heartily repented, making his humble praier vnto God for forgiuenes, & thereupon penned the one & fiftieth Psalme in testimonie of his repentance; his heart was not so wicked as was the heart of Saul: but in the outward face his sinne to the eies of the world was more vile then the sinne of Saul. ShallDauid was not therefore a reprobate because he sinned more vilely then a reprobate. 
                  Dauid therefore say, I am a reprobate, for I haue sinned more vilely then Saul that was a reprobate? this were first to step too presumptuously into to the throne of Gods iudgement. Secondly it were to be vnthankfull vnto God, for that faithfull and most constant loue of his, that euen with such sinnes was not extingushed. Thirdly it were to be vnkind and iniurious to his owne soule, denying vnto himselfe the hope & comfort that he might and ought to seeke in the infinite mercy of God: therefore though our afflicted sinner haue sinned

more vilely then many reprobates, it followeth not that hee himselfe must therefore be a reprobate: and though they that be reprobates, doe by their sinnes after committed, deserue the damnation, whereunto by the decree of reprobation they are appointed, yet hee and others committing sinnes worthy of condemnation, are not therefore to be iudged reprobates: and his sinne though grieuous, (as he affirmeth it truely to be) is no signe nor euidence of reprobation.
               Secondly hee alledgeth the wrath ofGods wrath vpon me for sinne is no euidence of reprobation God, now heauie vpon him for his sinne, to be another euidence of his reprobation: which likewise must not be granted. For if this should bee a true rule, that wheresoeuer Gods iust wrath falleth vpon men for their sins, they vpon whom this wrath falleth should be reprobates, then would these great absurdities follow. First that all that suffer with Christ in this world should be reprobates. For there is no calamitie that falleth vpon men, in bearing whereof they become sufferers, but it falleth vpon them for their sinnes. And the calamitie so falling

is a stroke of Gods wrath. For the first thing, that the calamities that make vs sufferers, fall vpon vs for our sinnes, the words of Ieremie are plain, saying, Wherfore
                  Lam. 3. 39. 
                  is the liuing man sorrowfull man suffereth for his sin: we suffer no calamitie, but our sinnes (deseruing more) hath brought that vpon vs. And for the second thing, that the same calamitie comming vpon vs for our sinnes, is a stroke of the wrath of God, that is, of his holines abhorring sin, & of his iustice correcting for sin, appears by the words of the Prophet Micha, speaking thus of God, Hee
                  Mica. 7. 1
                        •…
                     . 
                  retaineth not his wrath for euer, because mercy pleaseth him: he will turne againe, and haue compassion vpon vs, he will subdue our iniquities, and cast all their sinnes into the bottome of the sea. That is, for a while he punisheth in wrath the sinnes of his people, and after some short affliction indured, he forgiueth their sinnes, and receiueth them againe into fauour. In that saying of the Prophet, the worke of God in laying calamitie vpon his seruants for their sinnes▪ is called his wrath. So that all the euils that fall vpon men, which suffer with Christ in this world,

come vpon them for their sinnes, and are the stroke of Gods wrath against sinne, (not to destroy, but to correct) therefore if it were a true rule, which our afflicted sinner speaketh, that where Gods wrath falleth vpon men for their sinnes, that wrath should be an euidence, of the reprobation of the person vpon which it is fallen, then those men which suffer with Christ in this world, should bee reprobates: which is most absurd and vntrue, for that suffering is rather an euidence of their election vnto saluation, because it is written, It is a true saying,
                  2. Tim. 2. 11 
                  for if we be dead with Christ, wee shall liue with him: if we suffer, wee shall also raigne with him. But no reprobate shall reigne with Christ, that is the blessed prefermēt of them onely that are the elect of God.
               Secondly, if all that beare the wrath of God for sinne were reprobates, and that wrath an euidence of their reprobation, then this absurditie would follow, that God should neuer bee displeased with his elect whatsoeuer they doe, & should neuer lay any iudgement vpon them, that might be interpreted to be an euidence of his wrath, and iust displeasure

against their sinnes. Whereas the contrary is most true, and God often lets his wrath fall heauily vpon his elect for their sinnes. To that end heare the words of Gods Church, speaking to the malignant company of her enemies, thatMicah. 7. 7. reioice at her trouble, I will look vnto the Lord, I will wait for God my Sauiour, my God will heare me. Reioice not against me, O mine enemie, though I fall, I shall arise; when I shall sit in darknes, the Lord shall be alight vnto me; I will beare the wrath of the Lord, because I haue sinned against him, vntill he plead my cause and execute iudgment for mee: then will hee bring mee forth vnto the light, & I shall see his righteousnes. The Church confesseth that she bare the wrath of God, shee confesseth that that wrath fell vpon her for her sinnes, and therefore promiseth to beare it patiently, because she bare it iustly, and she takes not that wrath of God for any euidence of reprobation, neither ceaseth to esteeme her selfe the chosen of the Lord, that shall inherit his fauour. And therefore she exerciseth her faith in looking vp vnto the Lord, and out of faith promiseth her selfe all gratious respect

with God in her praiers, & shewes her selfe rich in hope, that God himselfe will in due time plead her cause, and bring her out of the darknes of her trouble into the light of ioy, and so magnifie his loue and fauour to her, that her aduersarie the malignant congregation shalbe ashamed. Therefore certainly God doeth often let his wrath fall vpon the elect for their sinnes, and the manifest strokes of Gods wrath cannot bee said to be infallible euidences and signes of reprobation, as our afflicted sinner affirmeth to his owne great hurt. And if hapily vpon hearing of these things thus spoken, his diseased mind should begin to cauill and to say, that if other iudgements and strokes of Gods wrath be not euidences of reprobation, yet that iudgement and stroke of wrath that is fallen vpon him is a plaine euidence of reprobation, his iudgement being accusing thoughts & a wounded conseience, the most heauie of all Gods iudgements, whereof Salomon saith, A
                  Pro. 18. 14. 
                  wounded spirit, who can beare it? For that stroke is the beginning of intolerable punishment, it is the very gate of h

is that worme that shall liue euer in the bosome of the damned, it is euen no other then hell vpon earth. And why shold God set a mans sinnes against him in so terrible a manner as hee doeth in this temptation, but because his meaning is to condemne vs for our sinnes, & aforehand to let vs see that hee shall doe it most iustly, our sinnes being so many and solothsome? against this cauill, and forThe particular stroke of a wounded conscience is no signe of reprobation. the remouing of this offence from his heart, I will adde this vnto that that hath been already spoken, that God doeth lay euen this particular stroke of his wrath, namely a wounded conscience in the sight of sinnes, vpon his elect, and therefore that wrath is no euidence of reprobation. The prophet Dauid bore this stroke of Gods wrath, whereof he speaketh thus, Thine arrowes haue light vpon
                  Psal. 38. 2.

Here was a stroke of the wrath of God, fot he complaineth, that Gods hand was heauie vpon

him, and that Gods arrowes had pierced him, and it was not a weake stroke, or slight touch, but forcible and fearefull, so that it made the whole man languish, and for the anguish of his soule his body also was consumed, and oppressed with paine and feeblenes, so that neither in his flesh nor in his bones remained any soundnes. And what stroke of Gods wrath was it? but euen this particular stroke of accusing thoughts, and of a wounded conscience by reason of sinnes that were so heauie a burdthen, that the vexation of them was his consumption? and was Dauid vpon whom this stroke of wrath fell, was hee a reprobate? if he were, he was such a reprobate as the Lord Iesus Christ was (and no other, nor otherwise) whom the builders refused & cast aside as vnfit for the building▪ but God made him the cheefe corner stone, as Peter saith, This is the stone
                  Acts. 4 11. 
                  cast aside of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. So in the kingdome of Israel, Saul, Doeg, and other busie doers, despised and cast aside the sonne os Ishai, but God did chuse him to build the kingdome of Israel. This

therefore is most certaine, that euen this stroke of Gods wrath, when hee setteth our sinnes in order against vs, is no more a signe of reprobation, then any other stroke of Gods wrath whatsoeuer. This part therefore of his obiection, when he calleth himselfe a reprobate, is a bold and desperate speech, wherein he shews himselfe presumptuous against GOD, and vncharitable against himselfe, and whether he be a reprobate or not, hee ought not to pronounce himselfe to be one, the name of reprobation hauing reference vnto the vnknowne and secret counsell of God, not vnto the knowne and manifest sinne of man. And though our sinnes deserue reprobation, & Gods wrath falleth vpon them that are reprobate, yet neither the sinne that wee are guiltie of, nor the wrath that is fallen vpon vs for that sinne (though it be this particular stroke of a wounded conscience) can be said to be arguments of reprobation.Our answers are such as will stand before Gods iudgment seate.
               
               And whereas he saith that we deuise answers to his obiections, that cary shew of strength among men, but those his obictions are vnanswerable before

God, and our deuised answers before him will be of no vertue. Let him know that the answers which wee haue made to his obiections, are all grounded vpon the word of God, by which word hee shall iudge all men, and all the causes of all men. As the Lord Iesus saith, The
                  Iohn. 12. 48 
                  word that I haue spoken, it shall iudge in the last day. And therefore our answers being grounded vpon that word, shall stand as rules of trueth before the iudgement seat of God, when all the obiections that he hath made, growing onely from feare, and from a weake heart, distempered with a temptation of vnbeleefe, shalbe found to bee of no force. And with this assurance of the sufficiencie of our answers, wee waite to heare what he can further obiect, why he may not hope for the forgiuenes of pardonable sins, seeing Iesus Christ by his commandement hath giuen him leaue to aske forgiuenes of sinnes, and God the father of our Lord Iesus hath promised to grant forgiuenes of sinnes, as hath before out of the word of God beene truely declared.

His sinne deserueth death, hee must die, & must doe the execution vpon. himselfe. sinner maketh vpon vs, and against himselfe (for this fierie dart is not easily quenched.) And againe, he obiecteth most vnkindly, saying, My sinne deserueth death, and I must die: I haue wronged the Lord of life, I haue prouoked him to anger, and by his iust sentence I must not liue. Also I haue spent the daies of my life on earth so wickedly, that I must liue no longer: There the earth is ouer-loaden with my transgressions, and refuseth to beare the burden of them. And as for the life of heauen, it were folly and madnes in mee, yea it were shameles presumption in me, to hope for any fruition of i

                  . I know no other place of life but these two; earth where life is mortall, and heauen where life is immortall: and heauen will not admit me to liue there, and the earth hath indured my life too long. Therefore I must die. This is the sentence of God. The Prophet Ezekiel saith, The
                  
                  soule that sinneth it shall die. And theEzeki 18. 4 Rom. 6. 23 Apostle Saint Paul saith, The wages of sinne is death. Who can controule this iudgement of God? who shall open his mouth against it? I doe my selfe approue it. And therefore I am become my selfe an enemie to mine owne life, yea heauen doeth abhor it, the earth doeth loath it, it must not continue, to the offence of God and his Angels, to the greefe of the Church and all true members of it. And therefore I

So shall I cease to sinne any longer against God. As the dead cannot praise him, so the dead can not blaspheme him, and as they haue no place to doe well, so I thinke they haue no place to doe euill; and by such course I shall deliuer my selfe from this violent temptation, I shall obtaine an end of my feare.

               But thou, O sorrowfull sinner, hearkenAnswer to this obiection. to the councell of God; let not the serpent that deceiued our first parents, deceiue thee: stoppe thine eare against his lying words, and be ready to heare what shall be taught thee in the name of God. God saith by the Prophet, Heare
                  Esay. 55. 3. 
                  & your soule shal liue. Heare, that thy soul may liue. Thou art vrged to desire deser ued death, thou art vrged, & yeldest with

thine owne hands to hasten, his death. Thy resolution to hasten it seemeth to be grounded vpon these reasons. First thou hast wronged and prouoked to anger the Lord of life, and therefore deseruest in his iustice to die. Secondly, thou hast burdened the earth (the place of mortall life) with thy sinnes, and art not worthy to liue any longer vpon the face thereof, and then to thinke that thou maiest liue in heauen (the place of immortal life) thou holdest to be shamlesse presumption. Thirdly, thou holdest thy life to be loathsome (it is so to thy selfe) because it is offensiue to God and to his Angels, to the church and members thereof. Fourthly, because thou hast not serued and glorified God by the continuance of thy life, thou wilt serue and glorifie him by hastening the end of it. Fistly, thou hast multiplied sinne all the daies of thy life, and thou thinkest that thou shalt cease to sin if once thou be dead. Lastly, whereas thy life is full of feare sorrow and bitternesse, thou thinkest by death to be freede at once from all. These are the reasons vpon which thou groundest thy resolution to

hasten thy death with thine owne hands, they may preuaile as reasons with them whom God hath left in the power of him, whom the Lord Iesus calleth, a

If wee iudge of the affections by the actions of men, and guesse what the heart desired by that which the hand hath done (and there is no surer rule, for the Lord Iesus saith, By their fruits yee shall
                  Matt. 7. 20 
                  know them) yea may we say, that where hatred made the Philistims enemies to Saul, and Iustice gaue power to Dauid in all seueritie to take away Achitophels life: neither hatred in the Philistims, nor iustice in Dauid, could make them to be greater enemies and more dangerous, then Saul and Achitophel were vnto themselues, for they made haste to doe the euill vnto themselues, that the

others came more slowly to doe: for though the Philistims made hast to kill Saul, yet Saul made more hast to doe it then the Philistims could: and whereas Dauid perhaps in his mildenes might haue bin intreaded to spare Achitophels life, Achitophel like a cruell iudge hating himselfe, made hast by speedy execution to preuent all pardon whom loueth hee that loueth not himselfe? whose friend can he be, that in this manner and measure is his owne merciles enemie? Goe then, and be more cruell then euer was murdering theefe, oppressing tyrant, bloudy Cain, or Senacheribs vngracious impes, goe and be more cruel then any cruel beast, that though it be an enemie to the life of other creatures, yet is a resolut defender of it owne life, if thou striue for the name and shame of most cruel, yea more cruel then man or beast (I will ad also, or then diuel, for the diuels studie not to doe themselues hurt) then goe and doe that violence that thou intendest against thy selfe, but if thou be willing to let the cruellest of men, the fiercest of beastes, yea the diuels themselues to goe before thee in

merciles crueltie, then preserue

               There is not onely merciles crueltieIt is the losse of all patience & of faith. in this sinne of selfe murder. But there is also totall want of those two cardinal Christiā vertues, that belong to the time of affliction namely of patience & faith, the Lord Iesus requirs no more in vs for our aduantage at that time then these two, remembring faith before patience, and saying, Come vnto me all yee that are
                  Mat. 11. 28 
                  wearie and laden, take my yoke on you, and learne of me, that am meeke and lowly in heart, Hee requireth faith in the first words come vnto me. He would haue vs come, Non pede sed fide, Not with our foote but with our faith, And nonpassus sed precibus, not with our shifting steppes, but with our constant praiers. His meaning is not that wee should set our feete within his courtes, but rather that we should with hope present our desires

before the throne of his grace, for this is the work of faith to draw neere to Gods mercy seate. And he requires patience in the next words, Take my yoake on you, Let there be no murmuring nor grudging against the yoake that God offreth to lay vpon your shoulders, spurne not against it, but take it meekely vpon you, & learn to submit your selfe vnto it. And Saint Paul requires no more in time of troubles, but these vertues of patience & faith, remembring patience before faith, saying, Let your patiente minde be knowen
                  Phi. 4. 5. 
                  vnto allmen, the Lord is at hand and saith in the next words be nothing carefull but in althings let your request bee shewed vnto God in praier and supplication with giuing of thankes. He requireth patience in the first words plainely, Let your patient mind be knowen vnto all men, and he requireth faith in the next words; describing faith by her effects and saying. Bee nothing carefull but let your requestes in all things be shewed vnto God in praier. Vnto these vertues of patience and faith continued and practised in the time of trouble, when we are wearied with our long and laden with our heauie burdens, both

                  Iesus the Lord and Paul his minister doe promise and assure all deliuerance and case. The Lord Iesus in these words, I
                  Mat. 11. 28. 
                  will refresh you, and yee shall find rest vnto your soules. And the Apostle Paul his minister in these words. The peace of
                  Phil. 4. 7. 
                  God which passeth all vnderstanding shall preserue your hearts and mindes in Christ Iesus. What canst thou require more in thy hottest conflictes, then to be refreshed by Iesus Christ? What canst thou desire in the greatest load of thy soule but to be eased of thy burden? what canst thou wish and long for more then this in thy greatest vexation, that the peace of God that passeth vnderstanding should preserue thy heart and mind in Iesus Christ? and this is promised by Christ the trueth and by Paul the witnes of trueth, to them that in their troubles doe suffer with patience & pray in faith. But thou in this thy desperate resolution hast lost all patience, and cast away thy faith, for if thou hadst patience thou wouldst not bee vnwilling to indure Gods visitation, and to suffer his good pleasure: and if thou hadst any faith in God thou wouldest trust to his helpe

and with much comfort waite for the day of saluation. Consider the qualitie of this sinne, and thou shalt see, that it doeth more spoile thee of thy helps, and makes the more naked of all good couering (if more may be) then were our first parents spoiled and made naked by the fraud of the serpent in the Garden. For patience and faith beeing the couering of the soule for such stormie times, thou hast lost all this cloathing: thou refusest to bee refreshed by Iesus Christ while thou refusest to hold the course, wherein hee promiseth to refresh thee. thou refusest to be eased by the help of his strong hand, whilst thou refusest the course in which he promiseth

If thou haue a purpose to destroy that God hath made, and wouldest oppose thy hand in destroying against the hand of God in building, attempt some of these things and try thy strength, that thou maiest suruiue thy fact, and liue to reape the glory of it. If these things be to great for thee, then cease to hold this conceit, to attempt the pulling downe of that which God

hath built vp, oppose not thy selfe against his worke, especially in pulling downe the frame of thine owne life, where thou must needes perish with thine owne worke, & not liue to glorie in that that thou hast done. And as God made thee at the first a liuing wight, so it is he that hath preserued thee all thy time, in the feeblenes of thy insancie, in the carelesnes of thy youth in the rashnes of thy riper yeares, all which seasons of thy life, made thee subiect to many decaies, thorough their proper frailties. But God made thy feeble infancie strong with his strength: he made thy ignorant and carelesse youth aduised and wise by his wisdome: he made thy rash and hold manhod to be safe through his prouidence. He that keepeth Israel and neither slumbreth nor sleepeth, it is he that hath kept thee. The Prophet speaketh thus vnto God in one of the Psames. Thou

safety. And while the creator of all things remaineth thy keeper, the creatures are in league with thee, and thou liuest in pace among them, and while the worke of God that preserueth thy life, hath this power among all creatures, that the creatures of heauen will not attempt thy hurt, the creatures of earth doe not attempt it, and the creatures of hell cannot. Wilt thou alone vnmercifully seeke to crosse the care of God in working thine owne woe? Then thou art worthy whom the heauenly creatures should abhorre, whom the earthly creatures should forsake, and the hellish creatures imbrace, receiued into their company, with this greeting, this is he whom God would haue kept; but against the loue of the Angels of heauen, against the peace of the creatures of the earth, and beyond the malice and power of vs Angels of darknes, hee hath destroied himselfe. Besides, it is God that hath assigned to euery one of vs the measure of our time, he hath appointed the number of our daies: our life did not begin till he appointed the first day of it, and so long it must last vntill hee

say, this is the last day of it. No man did set downe for himselfe when he would come into the world: and no man must set downe for himselfe when he will goe out of the world.

to bee a fugitiue seruant from God, if thou depart his seruic: before thy time be full out. And that belongeth to God, and not to thee to set downe. The Prophet Dauid saith of God in one of the Psalmes, To the Lord God, belong the

                  issues of death.

                  What hast thou done? the voice of thy brothers bloud cries vnto me from the ground. Now therefore thou art cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receiue thy brothers bloud from thine hand▪
                   And after the floud when hee began againe to replenish the earth with inhabitantes, he made a law against murder,

to restraine both man and beast from committing it, saying, Surely I will require

                  your bloud wherein your liues are: at the hand of euery beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, euen at the hands of a mans brother will I require the life of man. Who so sheddeth mans bloud, by man shall his bloud be shed: for in the image of God hath hee made man. So oftensiue vnto God it is for a man (without warrant and authoritie) to kill any; because man was made in the image of God, a creature of vnderstanding, indued with excellent vertues of knowledge and righteousnes, with resemblance in these vertues to God himselfe, in the making of whom it pleased God to shew his excellent power, his wisedome, and his mercy. No man, no beast can destroy this creature and bee innocent before God. It belongeth onely to him that gaue life to take it away; where he takes it away, who can giue it? and where he
                     •…
                   hath giuen it who shall take it away. So that the whole rule of life must remaine in the hands of the Lord of life: who of himself saith, I kill, and giue life. ExceptDeu. 32. 39 thou canst doe both, attempt to doe neither.

First make a liuing man if thou canst, and then kill him whom thou gauest life vnto, thou shalt hurt no worke therein but the worke of thine owne hands. But if thou canst not giue life, presume not to take away life, thou shalt therein violate the worke of another; and if thou maist not kill any other, thou maiest not kill thy selfe, one God made thee and them: and if thou shalt be guiltle of bloud in killing thy neighbour, thou shalt be guiltie of bloud in killing thy selfe: if thou maiest not touch the life of thy neighbour, thou maiest not touch the life of thy selfe. When Elias was weary of his life, being persecuted by Iezabel, hee said vnto God, It is
                  1. King. 19. 4. 
                  inough O Lord, take my soule, for I am no better then my fathers. Hee desired to be out of this present euill world, hee was wearie of the trauels and dangers of it: did he therefore kill himselfe; did he lay violent hands vpon his body, & let out his soule before his time? No: such thoughts were far from him, he remembred that God had placed his soule in that earthly Tabernacle, and he intreateth God to set his soule at libertie. Hee

held his hands, howsoeuer his heart was affected. So doe thou: hold thy hands from any fact of violence, and lift them vp with thy heart vnto God in heauen, and desire him to take thy soule when hee thinkes good. When the Apostle Paul was in a streight betwene two, and wist not whether he should desire life to continue in the world, or death to goe out of the world, because his life should be profitable to the Church, but his death gainefull to himselfe: he expressed the inclining of his heart to death for his owne aduantage in these words, Desiring
                  Phil. 1. 23. 
                  to be loosed, and to bee with Christ, which is best of all. His reward was in heauen, he desired to obtaine it: his redeemer was in heauen, hee desired to be with him: and because hee could not come to inioy his reward, and to be with his redeemer, except by death he should passe out of the world, therefore he was willing to depart, and to that end to be loosed and set at libertie from his flesh. But did hee incline to set himselfe at libertie, to loose the bands of his owne life, by which his soule was tied and fast bound, to the fellowship of his body?

no: he desired to bee a patient, not an agent, to be a sufferer, not a doer in this business: his words are, Desiring to be loosed. Not desiring to loose my selfe. This he longed, and this he waited for, and in time obtained it. In these men behold and see, how to craue and demeane thy selfe, learne of Elias & Paul learne of them that feare God: learne not of Saul and Iudas, learne not of wicked men, mē that went astray intheir doings.

In these cases, if thy life had beene vile in thy fight, it had beene a commendable thing in thee, to prefer the pleasure & honor of God, the trueth and glory of Iesus Christ, before the safety of thy life: for in this course, thou seruest with thy life, him that is the God of thy life: thou yeeldest it vp (being called for) into the hands of him that gaue it. And thou hast the examples of the Prophets of God, and the Apostles of Iesus Christ, to be thy patterne, who were euer ready and willing to lay downe and loose their liues in the seruice of God: they did not kill themselues to be deliuered from the fury of tyrants, but they yeelded themselues to the cruell will of tyrants.

Secondly,2 hee hath loaden and ouercharged the earth (the place of his present

life) with the burden of his sinnes, it groaneth vnder that burden, and can no longer beare it, it must be eased, and he that hath laied this burthen vpon the shoulders of the earth, is the most fitte to remooue the same: he hath hands wherewithall to doe i

Thirdly, hee saith his life hath been

And so great an offence must needes be remooued, that God and his Angells, the Church and her children may receiue content. These things prooue it iust, that hee should die. And that it should be a part of his inioyned penance to see the thing done himselfe. Now because my speech is intended for the health of the sinner, I will direct it to the sinner.
               
                  Thy first reason is, thou hast sinned againstThe weakeness of his first reason. God, thou deseruest to die. This reason is no reason to infer that which thou wouldest inferre. That therefore thou must die, and especially by thine owne hand. For all men sinne against God, & all men deserue to die: must all men therefore die? especially must they die by their owne hands? This I doubt not but thou thy selfe thinkest absurd for others, and yet thou thinkest it reason for thy selfe. But God himselfe denieth this argumēt to be of any strēgth, while he saith, or commandeth the prophet

                     zec. 33. 12 in his name to say, Say vnto them. As I liue saith the Lord God, I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way, and liue; turne you, turne you from your euill waies, for why will you die, O yee house of Israel? Is not God the Iudge? Is it not hee against whom thou saiedst thou hast sinned, and deserued death, and therefore must die? It shall be granted that thou hast sinned: It shall be granted that by that sinne thou hast deserued death: but where is that must, where is that necessity of dying, that thou speakest of?

when God saith it, and sweares it by his life (who liueth euer) that hee desireth not the death of a sinner. Thou dreamest of some inexorable seuerity in God, and some ineuitable necessity of death in the sinner: God saith no to both. There is no such seueritie in God. Hee is farre from vrging, that desires not the death of a sinner. And there is no such vnauoidable danger to man▪ while God doth offer him the way of life, euen then when he hath by this sinne deserued death; saying, As I liue, I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way, and liue. Seest thou not the vanitie of this first Argument? where of trueth afforded the premisses? for thou hast sinned against god, and thy sinne deserueth death. But errour, danger▪ death▪ and the diuell drew in the conclusion against trueth: for there is no necessitie, seeing God the Iudge requires no such death. (As I liue I desire not the death of the wicked:) and contrary to that conclusion sheweth a way of life, to his mind more ag

                  eeable, to the sinner more safe. (But that the wicked turne from his way, and liue,) returne

this argumēt to the diuel that lent it thee: it may be retorted vpon him in full strength. For he hath sinned against God, and by his sinne deserued death: and therefore must die, for God desireth the death of wicked angels▪ hauing shut them vp in euerlasting chaines vnder darkenesse vnto the iudgement of the last day, and hath not shewed vnto them any way of life. But for thy selfe learne to argue better, and frame thy argument so, that God may allow of it. I haue sinned against God, therefore I must repent, I must turne from my waies vnto God, and learne to walke in his waies. And againe, my sinne hath deserued death, therefore I must turne from my waies, that I may liue, for God hath sworn
                     •…
                  , that he desires not the death of a sinner, but that the sinner turne from his wicked way, and liue. These Conclusions are inferred according to Gods will, who desireth both thy conuersion from thy former sinnes, and also thy saluation contrary to the merit of thy sinnes, saying, Turne you,
                  Ezec. 33 11 
                  turne you from your euill waies, for why will you die, Oyee house of Israel? These

conclusions haue holinesse in them, agreeable to all the commandements of God, whereas thy former conclusions inuite to murder contrarie to GODS commandements: and these conclusions containe life and saluation in them, according to all the promises of God, whereas thy former conclusions containe death and destruction contrarie to his promises. If by thy former sinnes thou hast incurred the iust displeasure of God. This manner of reasoning that I haue taught thee, shews thee how to recouer his loue and liking, and if thy former sinnes haue brought thee into the danger of death; this maner of reasoning that I haue taught thee, shewes thee how to recouer life and saluation. Throw therefore thy foolish reason (I haue sinned, and therefore must die) in the face of him that framed it for thee: and remember euer that comfortableEzec. 33▪ 11 speech of God, As I liue, saith the Lord God, I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way, & liue: And frame thy Arguments by the direction of this word. I haue sinned against God, therefore I must turne from

my wicked waies. And my sinne against God hath deserued death. Therefore I must turne from my wicked waies▪ so shal I liue, this māer of arguing being as thou seest agreeable to Gods word, is both pleasing vnto God, and safe for thy selfe.
               Thy second reason grounded as thouThe weaknes of his second reason. thinkest vpon iustice, is this. I haue loden and ouer charged the earth with the burden of my sinnes, it groneth vnder that burden and can no longer beare it, therefore it must bee eased by the remouing of me. And forasmuch as I haue beene the man that haue laied this load vpon the earth, it is meete I should also be the man to remoue it. This latter part of thy reason, that thou shouldest be the man to remoue the burden, that hast beene the man to lay on the burden, I hold to be most reasonable, he that did the wrong, ought to make the mends. But let vs agree of the true burden that hath beene laid on by wrong, and must be remoued by right. That burden thou speakest of in the first part of thy reason, wherein thou arguest thus; I haue loaden the earth with the burden of my sinnes, which it can no longer beare:

therefore I must by death be remoued. Doest thou not behold and see an error in this arguing? yea a wicked and most deceitful fraud of Satan seeking subtilly to destroy thee, while in the antecedent of thy argumēt thou speakest of the burden that presseth the earth, thou namest thy sins, and they indeed make the earth to grone: and when thou commest in the conclusion of thy argument, to speake of remouing this burden, thou 
                     •…
                  aiest nothing of remouing the sinne, but speakest altogether of remouing thy selfe: thy sinne is the burden, and thou concludest not to remoue the sinne, but to remoue thy selfe. If a man wounded by another, and desirous to be healed, should apply his meanes to the party that made the wound, and not to the wound it selfe, doest thou not see, that man that made the wound may bee remoued, and the wound remaine still as dangerous as it was at the first: but if he apply his meanes to the wound that was made, the wound shalbe healded and so remoued, the man that made it remaining still. Thy case is altogether like it, thou hast giuen the earth a wound by

the burden of thy sinnes, if the meanes for the easing of the earth, be applied, not to the sinne to take away it, but vnto thee to take away thee, thou maiest be remoued, but the guiltines of thy sinnes shall remaine vnto iudgement. But if meanes be rightly applied to take away the sinne, the earth is eased of her burden, and thou also remainest in safetie, thy argument therefore should be framed thus. The earth groneth vnder the burden of my sinnes, therefore these sinnes must be remoued. Hee is vnwise that cannot, & he is vniust that will not discerne betweene the man that sinned, and the sinne by him committed. It is a true saying of Saint Gregorie. Man is the worke of God, sinne is the worke of man,
                  Lib. 4. Epist. 80. 
                  let vs therefore discerne what God hath made and what man hath done, and neither for the error that man committed, let vs hate man whom God made, nor for the man, that is Gods worke loue the sinne that man hath committed. According to this rule, discerne betweene thy selfe that art the worke of Gods hands, and thy sinne that is the fruite of thine owne inuention. I hope thou wilt not

say that the worke of Gods hands is a burden to the earth, and for the ease of the earth must be remoued, then thou as thou art a man and a liuing creature of Gods making, art not the earthes burden, neither is it the remedie to take the man away. But the sinne that thou hast committed is the burden of the earth, and the remedie of this euill is to take the sinne away: which is done on thy p

did God make promise of his free fauor in these words. I will not forsake thee, vntill I haue performed that, that I haue promised thee. So that it is not the worthines of the receiuer, but the promise of God that hee respecteth in shewing mercy and bestowing his blessings.

                  ne? then if thou wilt be carefull as thou hast beene taught, to put away

sinne by repentance, all the offence is remoued: heauen doeth no longer hate thee, and the earth hath not cause any longer to be an enemie vnto thee: what they loathed before, is now done away, and that succedeth in place which they haue cause to loue, and doe loue. That the offence which God tooke, is done away by thy repentance, appeareth by that which is said in the Gospell. Ioy
                  Luke. 15. 7 
                  shall be in heauen for one sinner that converteth, more then for ninetie and nine iust men, that neede no amendment of life. And when he saith there shall be ioy in heauen, he doeth not exclude the God of heauen, for what ioy can be in heauen and among the cratures of heauen, if the God of heauen remaine displeased? therfore thy repentance remoueth all cause of loathing from God, and receiueth therein all content, and in particular, it giueth content to the Angels of heauen. All cause of loathing & offence is taken from them, and in place thereof they reioice and are glad for thy conuersion. It is said in the same place of the Gospel, Likewise I said vnto you, there is ioy in the
                  Luke. 15. 10. 
                  presence of the Angels of God for one sinner
                  
                  that conuerteth. See how thy conuersion altereth the case: thy sinne maketh the Angels to loath thee as a filthy and abominable creature▪ thou art no sooner conuerted and changed by thy repentance, but they which loathed thee before, doe now loue thee; they which held the abomminable before, doe now esteeme thee as honorable.

And with this cunning the subtill Serpent hath preuailed

too far with many weake ones, God deliuer thee from him. Indeed God is honoured greatly by the destruction of the wicked, as he saith to Moses. When the children of Israel going out of Aegypt, were directed to goe by the way of the Red-sea through the Wildernesse, PharaoExo. 14. 3.

And after when Pharao with his host was come forth after Israel, and God had commanded Moses to goe toward the sea, to lift vp his rod, and streich out his hand vpon the sea, that a way being opened in the diuided waters, Israel might goe thorow, he said, Behold I will harden the hearts of the

and omnipotent God, when he cutteth off the wicked, and bringeth them down into destruction. They that perish had no intent to glorifie him, nor may they looke for any thankes or reward in regard of the glory that God hath by them, for they neuer studied to yeeld him any such praise, he wonne it altogether against their minde and purpose. And so in thy case, if thou shouldest persist in thy vngodly purpose, and shouldest out of thine owne daies by killing thy selfe, thy frowardnesse and wickednes should turne to his praise, his iustice should appeare to his great glory. But to thee no thankes nor reward should be due, as if thou haddest intended and laboured to bring glorie to his name, for what hast thou do
                     •…
                  e that thou canst thinke agreeable to his will? and worthy of his acceptation and reward. Did he euer giue thee any authority to take away the life of any? shew thy commission and warrant from God, that thy obedience and care to set vp Gods praise may appeare in thy lawfull and warrantable action. Many trespasses of subiects deserue death, and it is the Kings honour that

wickednesse in his people be punished: but is it lawfull presently for a priuate man to kill that trespasser, because hee hath iustly deserued death? he that doth it without authority and warrant from the King, shall hee not bee culpable of murder? If authority be giuen thee, it is thy praise to doe iustice, if thou haue no authority that act of iustice will be thy sinne, it will bee iustice to him that is slaine, but it will be murder in thee that diddest take away his life. So howsoeuer thy sinne doe deserue death, yet if thou kill thy selfe without authority (and God neuer gaue authority, nor wil giue to any to kill himselfe) thou sinnest presumptuously, and insteede of honouring God, doest dishonour him, first in committing wickednesse, and secondly in preuenting the noble honour of God, which he might haue won in forgiuing thy sinne. Gods glory is sought and often wrought by aduenturing thy life in his seruice, yea by loosing thy life in his seruice: this hee often requireth, and euer rewardeth. Therein a man truely sheweth that he preferreth Gods glory before his owne life. Thus the Prophets

and Apostles, and all holy Martyrs haue glorfied God by aduenturing first, and loosing at last their liues in his seruice. It is their comfort, their glory, their saluation, so to yeeld vp their liues to the seruice of the giuer of it. But Gods glory is not sought nor wrought by them, that in their discontent, and impatience, grudging at the troubles that hee hath laied vpon them, and despairing of his helpe to support and deliuer them, doe kill themselues, because they will not suffer. Therein they truely shew themselues enemies of Gods glory, grudgers at Gods will, preferring (euen to the losse of life) their owne wil before Gods will, their owne vniust will, refusing to beare the correction of God, before his iust will in correcting them. Can there be a more proud, a more wilfull, a more wicked and obstinat opposition against God then this? that a man shall say, I wil die before I will indure this at Gods hands, and after to doe it because hee may not haue his will against God. Neuer any Prophet, neuer any Apostle, or holy man euer did so. There is no comfort nor glory in it, but dispaire, horror

and eternall confusion in it. This therfore is a most false and wicked reason. Thou shalt truely glorifie God if thou amend thy life, thou shalt but dishonour and offend him in ending thy life.
               Thy second reason grounded vponThe vanity and weaknesse of the second of these reasons. supposed aduantage is this. Thou thinkest that by cutting of thy life, thou shalt sinne no more. And to cease from sinne thou holdest to bee very pleasing vnto God, and so it will proue beneficiall to thee. This reason is full of fraude. For first where thou thinkest that after deathHow the dead may be said not to sinne. thou shalt sinne no more, I deny it to be true in all men, otherwise then thus, that they can no more sinne after the manner of this world, they cannot betweene death and the resurrection, giue their members (that laie leueles in the graue, and turue to dust.)

doth it follow therefore that they sinneThe wicked continue to sinne euen when they are dead. no more? is not the hatred of God sin? impatiency in suffering deserued damnation, is it no sinne? can any imagine that damned soules haue laied off al maliciousnesse? and that those men, that while they liued, and were called vpon to serue the Lord, were allured by many blessings giuen, and by promise of many more, were threatned with Gods iudgements, and felt also some fauourable and easie corrections, would yet neuer hearken to the voice of God, would neuer loue him, neuer feare him, neuer cease from sinne, neuer regard to amend their waies, but continued obstinate, and died in their ignorance, stubbornnesse, malice and all their sinne? can any imagine that these, assoone as they are dead, should become free from sinne, and holy Saints, to please God by abstayning from euill, and to merit fauour? O most absurd imagination, to think that a man should become holy in Hell, that was profane vnto the last point of his life on earth. Hitherto properly belong the words of Salomon saying, If the tree doe

In that place he exhorteth to liberality and vertue while we liue, because when death comes, then there is no place of bearing after any fruits of goodnesse, after death there followeth no alteration of this kinde, to make either the good man worse then hee was, or the euill man better then hee was: if the tree fall toward the South it turneth not it selfe after to the North, and if it fall toward the North, it turneth not to the South. The good mans goodnesse continueth with him, and is increased rather then diminished, because he then inioyeth the goodnesse of God in Heauenly maner, to raise his loue vnto God to the highest degree and measure: and the wicked mans wickednes after death continueth with him, and is increased rather then diminished, because he now feeleth the wrath of God in the heauiest manner, to raise his hatred against God

was able to make the a contemner, then Hell is able to make thee a blasphemer, for if correction (intended for thy amendment) could not make the cease from sinning while thou didst liue. How much lesse can punishments, laid vpon thee, not by way of correction, but by way of condemnation make thee cease from sinning? the minde of the condemned, how it stands affected toward God, we may see by that which is written in the Booke of the Reuelations, Men boiled in great heate, and blasphemed

Where is then that aduantage that thou dreamest of, by not sinning any more after death?

And then, whensoeuer God shall be pleased to call thee out of thee out of the world, thou shalt end thy dayes in peace and comfort, and then thou shalt indeede cease from sin, and thy workes shall follow thee, to the gaine of eternall life.

               Thy third and last reason grounded vpon supposed aduantage, is this, thou thinkest that thy death shall bring with

it an end of all thy troubles, of all thy paine, and of all thy feare. And I verely beleeue, that all the former reasons, were but idlely pleaded by thee, that thou wert nothing at all mooued with them, and that thou didst onely alledge them, to make shew of doing that with reason, for which indeede thou canst haue no reason: and this last alleadged reason (though as weake, as vaine, and as deceitfull as all the other) was the onely thing that carried thy resolution. For all they that resolue vpon such desperate courses, doe it out of a conceit to ridde and free themselues from shame and troubles. But verily this act, if thou shouldest doe it (which God defend thee from) can not deliuer thee from trouble, from danger, or from shame. It is one of Satans lies: as truely as hee tolde our first parents, that by breaking Gods commaundement, they should be as gods, so truely doth he tell thee, that by this act, which is a manifest and violent breach of Gods commandement thou shalt free thy self from troubles. There is not a more readie

way to throw thy selfe into endlesse troubles.

Some other there are that belong to an other world, and to the time that followeth our departure out of this world. Hell that receiueth the wicked, is their proper place: and the time that succeedeth this life, their proper time. Of the first sort are pouertie and vnexpert losses, wearines, weaknesse and sickenesse, in our bodie, disquietnesse in our house, slaunders and disgraces, banishment, imprisonment, publique shame, displeasure of Princes, persecution and such like.

contempt, which Daniel speaketh of: outward darkenesse, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth, which our Sauiour speaketh of: euerlasting fire prepared for the diuell and his Angells, tormenting flame, abiection from God, the second death, and the bottomlesse pit, whose smoake ascendeth for euer. Of these speaketh Iohn the Euangelist, saying. Death and hell were cast into the
                  Reu. 20. 14 
                  lake of fire, this is the second death: and whosoeuer was not found written in the booke of life, was cast into the lake of fire. The first sort belonging to this life are short, tollerable, and mixed with many comforts: the second sort belonging to the time after this life, are eternall, intolerable, and no comfort is mixed with them, not so much as one drop of water to coole the scorched tongue. The first sort is common both to good and bad men, and may be borne, yea ouercome with patience: the second sort is prepared onely for the wicked, euen for the appointed vessels of wrath, and they giue no place to patience. And among all these troubles, one I finde, that seemeth to be common to both these places,

and that is accusing thoughts (thy present burden) but with this difference, that in this life it is but a matter of feare (though a tormenting feare) and after this life it is matter of torment (euen a most fearefull torment) in this life both good and bad are affrighted with this tormenting feare, after this life, onely the wicked and the reprobate are tormented with this fearefull torment.

This is not to take away the disease, but to assist the disease, too weake of it selfe to destroy thee speedily, and therefore thou callest for helpe, not to assist thee against the disease to ouercome it, but to assist the disease against thee, to ouercome thee, I perswade my selfe thou wouldst not send for the hangman, but wouldest send for the Physician, to cure thy disease with safety of thy self, whose knowledge and fidelitie might oppose against the danger of thy disease, and comfort thee to ouercome thy disease, and weaken the disease, that it might not ouercome thee: so deale with thy selfe in the time of thy Spirituall disease. Send not for death the hangman (death came into the world by the Iustice of God as

a punishment of our sinne) but send vnto God the Physician, that is able to remoue thy disease, and preserue thy life. God healeth by preseruation, not by destruction, deaths act (in this maner required) if it may be called a healing, healeth by destruction, not by preseruation, though I must confesse, that with death there comes an end of all present troubles, from sence and feeling whereof, he is deliuered that is dead.

When death commeth by the ordinary worke of Gods hand (to whom the issues of death belong) and the partie that dieth, is well prepared by faith in Christ, to leaue this world at the will of his GOD, that he may be gathered to his Redeemer, which is best of all.

which he passeth ouer to enter into true life. And this comes to passe, not by any secret vertue of death it selfe, but by the vertue of the death of Christ, making that by his grace to bee our medicine, that sinne had made to bee our poison. Augustine intreating of this point, thatDe Ciuitat. Deī lib. 13. cap. 4. death which he calleth poenam vitiorum, and supplicium peccator is, the iust paine of wickednes & punishment of sinners, should become as hee calles it, arma virtutis, and iusti meritum, the armour of vertue, and merit or happines of a righteous man, hee saith this commeth thus to passe, non quia mors bonum aliquod facta est quae antea malum fuit, not because death is now become a good blessing, that before was an euill curse. Sed tantam Deus fidei praestit it gratiam, vt mors quam vitae constat esse contrariam, instrumentum sieret per quod transiretur in vitam: that is, but God did afford so much grace vnto faith in his Son, that death which is knowne to be contrarie to life, should be made the instrument or way by which we might passe into life. So that death comming by the order of God, to a man prepared by faith in Christ, that neither through impatience hasteneth

death before his time, nor through loue of this world, or ignorance of his future happinesse, cowardly shrinketh, desiring to liue beyond his time: death comming to such a man in this maner, deliuering him from his present short and sufferable troubles, leaueth him in a blessed and happy condition, absolutely freed from all troubles, for the second death hath no power ouer him, and he is presently receiued into glorie. To him pertaine these words of Christ, He that
                  Iohn 5. 24. 
                  heareth my wordes, and beleeueth in him that sent mee, hath euerlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but hath passed from death vnto life. As the beleeuing thiefe passed from the Crosse to Paradise, and as soone as he was deliuered from his present trouble, entred into eternall glorie, and neuer felt eternall troubles: so euery beleeuer, when God calles him out of this world, from earth passeth to heauen, as Lazarus did from his houell into Abrahams bosome, and death leaueth him in a most happy state. For, Blessed are the dead which die in the

                  Lord, euen so saith the spirit, for they rest from their labours. No more trouble, no

more dāger, no more sorrow shal come to them.
               But death doth not prooue so beneficiallIt leaueth the wicked in a most wicked estate. to all. For when a wicked man dies, whether hee perish by fire as did the Sodomites, or perish by water as did Pharao and his Egyptians, or be swallowed vp of the gaping earth, as was Korah and his company, or were stoned to death, as was Achan, or be slaine with the sword, as was Ioab, or perish of some foule disease, as did Herod, or die a faire death in his bed, as the greatest number do, or fall by his owne hand, as Achitophel and some other did; howsoeuer he come to his end, with honour or reproach, with ease or with paine: the wicked man by death (though deliuered frō the troubls of this life, yet) is left in a most wofull estate, being ledde into the depth of all miseries. For from the earth they passe to hell, from short to eternall, from tollerable to vnsufferable crosses, from trobles mixed with comforts, which also in their bitterest condition may bee indu
                  
                     •…
                  ed, and ouercome with some little patience, to troubles mixed with no comforts, making euen the remembrance of

that sweet name of comfort to be a new addition of discomfort, and which giue no place for the least measure of patience to abide with them. Of the end and endlesse condition of the wicked, when death hath fetched them from hence, the Prophet speaketh in the Psalme,Psal. 73. 18 
                  Surely thou hast set them in slippery places, and castest them downe into desolation. How suddenly are they destroied, perished, and horribly consumed, as a dreame when one awaketh, O Lord, when thou raisest vs vp, thou shalt make their image▪ despised. There prosperity before death is slippery as Ice, there is no firme standing vpon it and when death commeth, that seemeth to giue ease and end of some intermixed troubles, they fall with violence, and there fall is remedilesse, they perish in it, and remaine miserable for euer, & whatsoeuer conceit they nourished of lasting and continued ease, it becommeth like a dreame, which proueth idle when the dreamer awaketh: Iob speaketh excellently of the wretched condition vnto which death bringeth the wicked, saying,Iob. 21. 17 
                  How oft shal the Candle of the wicked be put out, and there distruction come vpon
                  
                  them? Hee will deuide their liues in his wrath: they shall be as slubble before the wind, and as chaffe that the storme carrieth away. God will laie vp the sorrow of the father for the children, when hee rewardeth him, he shall know it: his eies shall see his distruction, and▪ he shall drinke of the wrath of the almighty: for what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of

                     is moneths is cut off? This good man Iob knew something, in what condition death leaueth a wicked man, when it hath fetcht him out of this world: then is he deliuered vp to the violent storme of Gods iust indignation, the stubble is not more easily nor more confusedly scattered then hee: then commeth the reward of all his wickednesse, hee was a doer before, from that time hee becommeth meerely a sufferer: then the fury of the almighty ceazeth vpon him, his daily drinke shall bee nothing else but the wrath of God: his pleasure after his death is altogether ended, and eternall woe lighteth vpon him. Let vs not stand onely vpon sentences, which may perhaps bee esteemed as lawes, which great men easily breake thorow and delude.

Let vs looke into the acts of God, and consider his reall proceeding: wee haue a notable example commended vnto vs by our Sauiour Christ, to whom the father hath committed all iudgement, and therefore hee should not bee ignorant of Gods carriage. He remembreth a great man, a rich man, which was cloathed in Purple and fine linnin, and fared wel and dilicately euery day. His welth and great estate could not protect him from the stroke of death, that made an end of him, and so of the troubles of his life, if his life were acquainted with any.
               But in what case did death leaue him? our Sauiour telleth vs in these words. The rich man died, and was buried, and being in hell in torments, hee lift vp his eies and saw Abraham a farre off, and Lazarus in his bosome, then he cried and said, father Abraham haue mercy vpon me, and
                  Lu. 16. 22. 
                  send Lazarus that hee may dippe the tip of his finger in water, and coole my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame: but Abraham said sonne remember that thou in thy life time receiuedst thy pleasure, and contrariwise Lazarus paine: now therfore is he comforted, and thou art tormented.
                  
Ther was his answer, stoping his mouth, & leauing no place for any further hope of any good. While he liued he was wel, if any thing were a little amisse, it was fully recompenced with many pleasures: in the end he died, and in that death his troubles (if he had any) ended and his pleasures also. And where did death leaue him? in Hell: in what estate there? in torments: with what hope of helpe? he had liberty to crie and call, but there was no reliefe: and it seemeth the man vnderstood and feared so much, and therefore in his request he was very moderate (if I may call it moderation, which was rather the faint request of a despairing heart) for hee desired not to be taken out of Hel, to be placed in Heauen where Lazarus was: he desired not to bee quitted wholy of his torments, and to possesse the ioyes of Paradice: he knew it was in vain to hope for or craue any such thing: And therefore like a saint-harted, fearing, doubting, and despairing creature, hee begged a drop of colde water, a thing of nothing, soone dried vp in the heat of that Fornace of fire where he fried. In the measure of his

request hee shewed the measure of his hope, hee craues a thing of nothing, as knowing that nothing was to be obtained.
               This is all the deliuerance from trouble,The sinners misery, that by killing himselfe seckes to be free from trouble. that thy act in killing thy selfe, and adding that vnnaturall sinne vnto all thy other sinnes, can helpe thee vnto: namly to deliuer thee from sicknesse, by thy death, and that death eternall, to deliuer thee from needlesse feare, by certain danger, and that danger for euer remedilesse: to deliuer thee from a little greese, by endlesse woe, and that we also vnsufferable: to deliuer thee from some discontent, by eternal vexation heaped vp beyond measure: to deliuer thee from the slight offence of a litle sun-burning, by casting thee into the flames of Hell fire, that neuer shal be quenched: to deliuer thee from some disgrace among men, by making thee, as Esay speaketh to be an abhorring to all flesh. This is thatEsa. 66. 24. sweet aduantage that thou dreamest of, that thy death shall bring with it an end of all thy feares, troubles, and disgraces, indeede it is the most sure way to bring vpon thee all feare trouble and disgraces;

it endeth present, and beginneth future troubles. It endeth short, and beginneth eternal troubles, it endeth easie and tolerable euils, it beginneth wofull and intolerable euils. So that there is no deliuerance to be hoped for this way, it turneth in conueniences into mischiefes, and turneth offences into hellish torments: in one word it turneth a weary life that may bee helped, into a wofull death that cannot be helped. Hee that hateth thee with a deadly hatred, cannot deuise to doe or wish vnto thee a greater mischiefe, then this, that thou vnwisly concludest against thy self, therfore change thy minde while yet thou hast time, hurt not thy selfe, please not thine enemies, offend not thy God, quench not the light of life that he hath kindled in thy breast, breake not the prison of thy body, in which God hath shut vp thy soule as a prisoner for a season: it is neither a matter of iustice for thee without commission to punish thy selfe with death: neither is it a matter of aduantage for feare of falling into danger, to throw thy selfe headlong into danger. Beare thy crosse with patience

yet a little while, and trust in the mercy of God by Christ. So shall thy sinnes be forgiuen, thy life shall be saued, and in due time peace shall be restored to thy soule.

Such a Steward, such a seruant am I, I haue made waste of the daies of my life, I haue brought no glory to God by them, therefore I hold my selfe vnworthy of life, and wil not seeke to nourish it: besides I am not worthy of meat, I wil not eat: I am not worthy of drinke; I will neuer quench my thirst: I am not worthy of my clothes to couer my wicked carcase, nor of my bed to rest my vngodly bones vpon: I am not worthy of thy company, of thy comfort, of these mercifull words of counsell that thou giuest mee: I am worthy of nothing: cast me out to the dung-hill as a crumbe of vnsauory salt, speake no more vnto mee, doe no more seruice for me, giue nothing vnto me, let me perish: I know how vile I am before God, and I am as vile in mine owne sight, and let mee be no dearer in your

               O poore afflicted soule, these wordsAnswere to this twelfth obiection. doe much moue my compassion toward thee, to see that humilitie should become hurtfull to any poore seruant of God, and that the confession of our vnworthines should preiudice our comfort in God, and our releefe from God, euen then when God doth ofter releefe, and in those things wherein God doeth offer comfort. Here is an error that must be helped. This error is not in thy confession of thine vnworthines, therein we & all Gods children wil ioine with thee, and euery man confesse that wee are not worthy of the least of Gods mercies, because we haue beene vnthankefull for the comfort that wee haue reaped by them, and haue also beene vnfaithfull not improueing them to the praise of God, we will say with Iacob vnto God. I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies
                  Gen. 32. 11 
                  and all the trueth which thou hast shewed vnto thy seruant. We will confesse vnto Christ with the Centurion, and say,

                  I am not worthy that thou shouldest come
                  Mat. 8. 8. 
                  vnder my roofe: And with the prodigall childe, priuie to his owne riotous courses, we will say to God, as he said to his father, Father I haue sinned against heauen
                  Luke. 15. 21. 
                  and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy sonne. If vnthankefulnes can make thee vnworthy, we cannot be worthy, that haue beene as vnthankefull: and if vnfaithfulnes can make thee vnworthy, wee must stand by thee, and confesse as much against our selues▪ if any mans sinne may make him vnworthy, then are wee as vnworthy as any man, for wee also haue sinned and iustly displeased our God. But the errorWherein the error of this obi
                        •…
                     ction heth. is in this, that, because thou doest iudge thy selfe vnworthy of the good giftes of God, therefore thou shouldest forbeare to vse them: alas what should become of the creatures of God, if all should forbeare to vse his guiftes that are vnworthy of his guiftes. This must needes produce a generall decay of all Gods creatures.
               Vnderstand therefore these thingsGod alloweth his blessings to the vnworthy. following. First God doeth allow his blessings, not to the worthy onely, but

to the vnworthy also. Of him the ProphetPsal. 145. 9 saith. The Lord is good vnto all, and his mercies are ouer all his workes. Because the creatures are the worke of his hands, therefore (without regard whether they be worthy or not worthy) hee will extend his mercy vnto them. Of him the Lord Iesus saith. He maketh his Sunne to
                  Mat. 5. 45. 
                  arise vpon the euill and the good, and sendeth raine on the iust & vniust. God is not ignorant either of the worthines of the good and iust, or of the vnworthines of the euill and vniust, but hee regardeth the necessities of all, and therefore because their grounds equally haue neede, in time of droght of the dew of heauen, and in time of winters cold, of the refreshing warmth of the sunne, therefore he giues the heate of the sunne, and moisture of his clowdes, to make all their groundes fruitefull, be the owners of those groundes good or euill, yet hee will bee good vnto them. Secondly,The vnworthy craue, obtaine, & vse Gods blessings. those men, that haue in iudgement found and acknowledge their owne vnworthines, yet in their necessities haue made suite vnto God for those good things which they wanted, and haue

thankefully receiued and cheerefully vsed the good things that God sent them. Iacob that acknowledged his vnworthines, euen then made request vnto God for his mercy to bee shewed him, saying. I pray thee deliuer mee from the

                  riches, but in the liuing God, which giueth vs ubundantly all things to inioy. He

giueth all things: he giueth all things abundantly: and hee giueth that aboundance to be vsed and inioied. Therefore doeth the Prophet Dauid say. Hee

                        •…
                     e to make the face to shine, and bread that strengtheneth mans heart. All this increase of Gods blessings, the Prophet affirmeth to be giuen for mans vse, and also in some sort limiteth that vse, shewing vs what good God intendeth that wee should reape of his guiftes, and hee intendeth his owne praise in this bountifull giuing of his blessings. And therefore is it, that Saint Paul at Listra commendeth to those gentiles, the God that made the heauen & earth, commending him by his bountie in giuing those things, so to make his goodnes knowen. And therefore he speaketh thus of him. He left not himselfe without witnes, in that
                  Acts. 14. 17 
                  he did good, and gaue vs raine from heauen, and fruitfull seasons, filling our hearts with foode and gladnes. This good did God for the Gentiles, he gaue them the

dewe of heauen, and fatnes of the earth, with his guiftes, hee filled their hearts, that is satisfied their desires, and made them to reioyce in the vse of those guiftes. And all this he did for them, to this ende, that they might know the boundles goodnes of this God, and that his blessings, as so many faithfull witnesses might preach and declare this goodnes of his, if by this meanes at the last they would turne backe from their idols to serue and please him: and to this purpose serue the words of Moses vnto the people of Israel, saying, When
                  Deu. 8. 10. 
                  thou hast eaten & filled thy selfe, thou shalt blesse the Lord thy God, for the good land which he hath giuen thee. In these words be plainely signifieth vnto vs, that when God hath giuen vs fruitfull habitations, and giuen vs foode and all necessarie things, his meaning is, that we should receiue and vse his guiftes, and giue him thankes for his goodnes. Whosoeuer therefore refuseth to vse the guiftes of God for their comfort, contemne his bountie, and denie him his due praise, while they refuse the things for which they should praise him. And most excellent

are the words of the Prophet Ioel, promising in Gods name these his blessings to the people, and requiring their thankes for them to bee returned vnto God, saying, The barnes shalbe full
                  Ioel. 2. 24. 
                  of wheate and the presses shall abound with wine and oile, and I will render you the yeares that the Grashopper hath eaten, the cankerworme, and the caterpiller and the palmerworme, my great host which I sent among you, so shall you eate and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God, &c. Consider rightly of these words: in them the Prophet teacheth vs, that when God sendeth the fruites of the earth, his good blessings vnto vs, his meaning is that we should eate, and in eating be satisfied, and for this satisfaction blesse Gods name. This is Gods meaning in sending them and thou wilt not receiue them, thou wilt not eate that thou maiest be satisfied, thou wilt not vse them to the comfort and gladnes of thine heart: is there not in thy course manifest contempt of Gods goodnes? as if thou didst say vnto him, let him keepe his guiftes to himselfe, let him giue me none, I care not for them, I will

not receiue them, I will not vse them, I will not be beholding to him for them, veriely this is the stubbornes of an vntoward child, that being in his foolish and froward nature, displeased with his father, refuseth to receiue bread at his fathers hands.
               Lastly vnderstand that this resolutionThis abstinence is 
                        〈◊〉
                      dangerous to thy life, as violence can be. to refuse the comforts of life, differeth but little from the former resolution to hasten violently thine owne death: for that which thou thoughtest before to doe with Sauls sword or Achitophels 
                  
                     •…
                  lter, thou wilt now doe with foolish and willfull abstinence, most idle pretending thy vnworthines, as if in meere humilitie thou wouldest kill thy selfe. And if the matter be wisely considered, this course of weakning first, and after ouerthrowing thy life, will be found a more cruell act, then that of Saul or Achitophel, for they quickly rid themselues out of the paines of death, but thou like a cruell executioner, doest kill thy selfe slowly, with a lingring kinde of torment. The Prophet Ieremie saith, They that be slaine with the sword are better,
                  Lam. 49. 
                  then they that are killed with hunger,
                  
                  for they fade away as they were stricken through for the fruites of the field. Let these words weigh with thee, and take heede that thou be not a most cruell tormenter to thy selfe. The prophane histories report of a noble Roman, whose name was Marcus Portuis Latro,
                  Portuis latro. that being wearie of a quartan ague, that he had indured long, and whereof he could not be healed, hee killed himselfe with his sword. And they make like mention of one Eratosthenes a Cirenaean,
                  Eratosthenes. the keeper of the famous Librarie of Ptolome in Egypt, that being long vexed with a disease, whereof he could find no remedie, in the end by absteining from meate killed himselfe. Both out of discontent ended their owne liues, one by laying violent hands vpon himselfe, the other by withholding helpinghands from himselfe: the one by applying that that did destroy life, the other by denying that that should preserue life: which of these canst thou excuse of murder? of the vnnaturall murder of himselfe? and if both were murderers, which of them was the more cruell in the 
                     〈◊〉
                   & iudgement of the world?

surely the second, that absteined from the good things that he might & ought to haue vsed, for hee prolonged his first greefe, and ioyned a second greefe (euen the teeth of famine) to it, and so with a double prolonged plague consumed himselfe: whereas the other made quicke dispatch, this fondnes therefore in refusing to vse the good guiftes of God, because the conceite is entred into thy phantasie that thou art vnworthy of them, is not a fruite of Christian humilitie, inspired by the Holy Ghost, it is foolishnes, it is extreame dotage: yea if I should call it by the right name, I should say it is high crueltie against thy selfe, besides that, it is vile vnthankfulnes against God, and the aduiser was no other then the old serpent that deceiueth the whole world.
               Lay all these things together: first theThe conclusion of the answere to this obiection. bountie of God that giueth his blessings not onely to the worthy but also to the vnworthy, because the necessitie both of the worthy and of the vnworthy doeth require it: and by vnworthy, I doe not meane the godly, that in true humilitie doe iudge themselues vnworthy

of Gods fauour (for God esteemeth them worthy) but I meane the wicked▪ whatsoeuer they thinke of themselues for God doeth esteeme them vnworthy) euen vnto them doeth God allow his good blessings. Secondly, the behauiour of all the wise and well aduised sonnes of Adam, who euen then when they see and acknowledge their vnworthines, yet in the feeling of their necessities and wants, doe make hearty praier vnto God, that hee will be pleased to bestow his blessings vpon them: and it is not onely a libertie that nature taketh to seeke for helpe in time of necessitie, but it is the libertie that God in his mercy giueth to his seruants, and which in pietie and faith they doe vse, namely to fly to God their helper in all necessities. Thirdly the purpose of God the giuer of all good things, who giueth them not in vaine, but for our seruice and helpe, that we might vse them, and being cheared by their vse, might returne vnto him with thankes for his goodnes, so that whosoeuer refuseth to receiue them and vse them, deludeth as much as in him lies the good purpose of God, reiecteth

the offred mercy of God, and intercepteth the praise of God, while hee refuseth to receiue & vse that, by which God seeketh to merit and winne praise at his hands. Lastly the nature and qualitie of the thing it selfe, namely the refusing of good things that God giueth and thou needest, it is a wilfull killing of thy selfe, while thou doest obstinately refuse to vse the things that may preserue thy life: & it is a most cruell kinde of killing thy selfe, while thou doest consume and waste thy selfe by little and little, tearing thine owne bowels with the teeth of inforced famine, continued and increased from day to day, for it is a more grecuous thing to be slaine by famine then by the sword: lay all these things together, and thy doc proue, this abstinence of thine grounded vpon pretence of vnworthines, to be a foolish, vngodly and a cruell course. Put it therefore from thee, and vse the loue of thy friends, the helpe of the Phisition, the counsell of thy minister, the cheerefull seruice of them that are about thee, vse thy bed, thy clothes, thy meate prepared for thy ease, thy couering, thy nourishment,

vse all the creatures of God in their kinds, and praise God that thou maiest haue them. S. Paul saith, Euery creature of God is good, and nothing ought
                  1. Tim. 4. 4 
                  to be refused, if it be receiued with thanksgiuing, for it is sanctified by the word of God and praier. It ought not saith he to be refused, it ought to be receiued with giuing of thankes. And if we vse praier vnto God, that it will please him to blesse vnto vs his owne gift, which the word of God alloweth vs to vse, he will sanctifie it for our good: For God that giueth these things is good, the things themselues that God doth giue are good, therefore the effect of them being Christianly vsed cannot but bee good. Continue the opinion of thine owne vnworthinesse, but reiect thy vnwise purpose of refusing to vse Gods creatures for thine vnworthinesse.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XXX.
               
                  OVR poore distressed sinner,A thirtenth obiection. He feareth death for two causes. reclaymed from the conrses, that in his last obiections hee remembred, the first being a quicke violent and apparent purpose of ending his owne life, the second being a slow dangerous and close purpose of wasting his life, is not yet so freed from the troubled thoughts of death, that he can with a quiet hope of life looke to the God of life: and thus further out of remayning feare obiecteth, to the disquieting of his owne heart; though I may not hurt my life with violent hands, as first I thought to doe, and must nourish my life with seruiceable hands, which in the second place I thought not to haue done: yet my life must come 'to an end by the condition that all Adams children are subiect vnto. God said to Adam in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till
                  Gen. 3. 19. 
                  thou returne to the earth, for out of it wast thou taken, because thou art dust, and to
                  
                  dust shalt thou returne. This was the condition of the first man, this is the condition of all men, and among all it is also my condition, I must die, if I cherish life neuer so carefully. And this remembrance of death (considering my present woefull estate) is fearefull vnto mee two manner of waies. First I feare lest deathFirst least he die before this temptation cease, that were to die without faith. should take mee away before I be deliuered from this temptation, as it may well doe; for I may die to day, or to morrow, yea I may die presently. And if I should so hastily die while this feare (directly contrary to faith) lieth yet vpon my conscience, I should die in my infidelity, I should die without faith in Christ: and so to die without faith in the sonne of God, is the high-way to eternall damnation▪ for the Lord Iesus saith, he that beleeueth not, is condemned already,
                  Ioh. 3. 18. 
                  because he beleeueth not in the name of the only begotten sonne of God. SecondlySecondly, least the accusation be renewed after death if there should be any ceasing and intermission of these accusing thoughts before my death, yet I feare death, because after death this accusation may bee renewed, and the precedent ceasing proue no doing away for euer, but onely a deferring

for a time of this plague. And I haue cause to feare such a thing, because the right time of preferring accusations against sinners, is the time after death, when men must come to iudgement: as the Apostle saith, it is appointed vnto men
                  Heb. 9. 27.. 
                  that they shal once die, and after that commeth the iudgement. After death the soule commeth to iudgement, the book of conscience must then be opened, and accusations then or neuer must be heard: and if these accusations now be so grieuous vnto mee, now while iudgement is far off, while there is place for repentance, and hope of forgiuenesse, surely they will then be much more fearefull, woefull, miserable, horrible: therefore the remembrance of death, come it sooner, or come it later, come it before or after the stay of this temptation, is fearfull vnto me.
               This obiection is not hard to bee answered; Answer to this obiection. thou fearest death two manner of waies. First, lest it come before thou haue ouercome this temptation, and recouered peace with God by faith in our Lord Iesus. And thou fearest this hasty comming of death for two causes, one

is because it is possible that it may so come, for we may (and must if God cal) die presently: another because it is dangerous so to die, thou takest thy temptation to bee directly opposit to faith, therefore if thou die before it bee ouercome thou diest without faith, and to die without faith is sure damnation. Thus thou fearest deathes hasty comming, and to thy feare of death this way growing we will first make answer.
               Against thy feare of death commingThere is hope that thy temptation shall end before death come vpon thee. before thy temptation be ouercome, God giueth comfortable hope, that death shall not come before thy temptation be ouercome. And it comes not at all, but by the appointment of God, neither sooner nor later then he appointed it. For hee sent vs with life into the world, he hath appointed the length of our life in the world, and the time and manner of our dying and departing out of the world, lieth onely in his pleasure, of whom the Prophet saith, To the Lord
                  Psal. 68 20. 
                  God belongeth the issues of death. The set time for the produceing of all his appointed workes resteth in his owne counsell when the Apostles questioned

the Lord Christ (after his resurrection) for the restoring of the kingdome to Israel, he made them answer, It is not for
                  Acts 1. 
                  you to know the times, or the seasons, which the father hath put in his owne power. And if the time of all his workes be put and placed only in his power, then the time of thy death, which is one of this workes is put only in his power. But his God that hath the sole disposing of thy death, hath, as I said, giuen thee comfortable hope that death shall not come before this thy temptation be ouercome. For this we haue his gracious promise, deliuered by the pen of the blessed Apostle Paul, saying; God is faithfull, that will
                  1. Cor. 1

                  not suffer you to be tempted aboue that you be able, but will giue the issue with the temtation that ye may be able to beare it. Here he promiseth an issue of euery temptation, and also that the man burdened there with shal be able to beare it and ouercome it. And hitherto though this temptation hath beene grieuous vnto thee, and in bearing of it thou hast felt and found thine owne weaknesse, yet God hath supported thee, and thou hast beene inabled to indure weary daies and

comfortlesse nights. And in the meane time, while this temptation hath lasted, for thy further strengthening thou hast inioyed many mercies of God, both in thy soule, and body, and estate, and friends; for hee hath not smitten thy soule with the stroke that fell vpon Nebuchadnezzar, thou hast had, and stil hast thine vnderstanding free, to inquire after God, and harken after his mercy, and he hath not smitten thy body with the bile of Aegypt▪
                   but thou hast beene able in body to stand vnder thy burden, and to performe many good seruices in thy calling: and he hath not smitten thee in thy children, friends, and goods, with the rod of patient Iob, but thy estate remaineth safe, thy friends are cheerefull about thee, such mercies of God haue accompained thy affliction, and ministred comfort vnto thee in the time of it. And in these things, one part of that promise deliuered in Gods name by the Apostle hath beene performed vnto thee, (God will not suffer you to be tempted aboue that you be able.) He himselfe that sent the temptation, gaue thee strength to beare the temptation, and vnto this

day thou bearest it, though not without griefe, yet not without hope. Why then shouldest not thou withall cheerefulnes, hope and pray, that God would performe vnto thee graciously the other part of that promise (but will giue the issue with the temptation &c?) Doth not the Apostle, when he giues vs that promise in Gods name, vse a preface to perswade our hearts to hope for it, and pray for it, commending God, in whose name hee giues it, by the title of faithfull, saying, God is faithfull that will not suffer you to be tempted aboue that yee be able? Hope then in that faithfull God, pray vnto that faithful God, who hath already approued his faithfulnesse, in performing vnto thee theone part of his promise, and as he is true and faithful, he will (hauing freely bound himselfe) performe his whole promise, and giue an issue of thy temptation, and thou shalt liue to ouercome it. And heere I will acquaint thee with an holy rule, which God obserueth in the temptations of his seruants, which rule offereth hope of deliuerance from thy greeuous temptation before death.
               
                  The rule is found in Deuteronomie, where Moses speaking to the people of Israel, and remembring their wearie wandring through a roaring and terrible wildernesse, and the many heauie accidents that in that wildernesse came vnto them, saith, that God led them that way, to humble them, and to prooue
                  Deut. 
                        •…
                     . 16 
                  them, that he might doe them good in the latter end. Gods meaning was, after a hard beginning to bring them to a comfortable end, when they were first humbled and prooued. And very meete it is that Gods seruants should bee humbled: and it is right in God to prooue his servants, whether they loue the Lord with all their heart, and will indure with patience his good pleasure and whether they will cleaue vnto him in danger, and put their trust in his mercies: and this proofe is best made by crosses and troubles: for this cause doth God send troubles to his seruāts whom he loueth, but alwayes with a reseruation, in his good purpose, to do them good in the latter end. Apply this vnto thy selfe: It was fit that thou shouldest be humbled, to acknowledge thy selfe

before God to be dust and ashes, and laden with iniquitie: to humble thee in this sort, God hath sent this crosse, doe1. Pet. 5. 6. thou therefore humble thy selfe vnder the mightie hand of God, that hee may exalt thee in due time. It was fit that thou shouldest be prooued, that thou mightest see thine owne strength to bee but rotten
                     •…
                  es, and dust, and that thou mightest shew thy loue, thy patience, thy faith in God, that it might appeare whether God or thine owne case were dearer vnto thee, and whether thou wilt glorifie him in aduersitie, as thou ma
                     •…
                   kest shew to doe in dayes of peace and prosperitie: and thus to prooue thee he hath sent this temptation: therefore now shew thy selfe a man, shew thy selfe a Christian, shrinke not from God, murmure not at his visitation, suffer with patience, and pray in faith, and be constant vnto the end. And hee that hath brought thee into this temptation, as it were into a roaring wildernesse, to humble thee, and to prooue thee, will surely doe thee good in the latter end. Surely this rule offereth vnto thee comfortable assurance, that before the end

of thy dayes, thou shalt see an end of thy temptation, and such an end as shall bring thee more ioy, then thy affliction doth now breed thee griefe.
               But say that death do take thee away,If death com before, yet there is faith euen where this temptation is strong. before thou hast ouercome this temptation, and thou fearest it may doe so, grounding thy feare vpon two reasons, one is the possibilitie of it (thou maiest die presently) the other is the danger of it (thou thinkest that then thou shalt die in infidelitie and without faith) if this danger were not, the possibilitie of dying, and death it selfe, whensoeuer comming, could bee no iust ground of thy feare: for the Patriarks and Prophets, yea Christ himselfe the Sonne of God, and his holy Apostles died, and all the Saints of God die. And it can not bee hurtfull to any, that is so common to all, except there be some speciall danger annexed to it, that makes it hurtfull to one, that is not hurtfull to an other. This danger thou saiest is thine infidelitie. And thine infidelitie and want of faith, thou proouest by the qualitie of thy temptation, which thou takest to be directly opposite to faith, and the banisher

of all faith. If therefore it shall appeare, that though thou die before thou hast ouercome this temptation to thy liking, yet thou wātest not faith in Christ, euen faith vnto saluation, then there is no cause of feare.
               Indeede this temptation argueth aIn this tēptation ther is infidelity roote of infidelity to remaine in thee: for seeing the Lord Iesus hath borne our sinnes in his body vpon the tree, and in bearing them hath taken them away, and hath washed and cleansed vs in his bloud: and seeing God the father of our lord Iesus Christ, receiuing satisfaction in the sacrifice of his Sonne, hath by an irreuocable word promised to forgiue our sinnes, and to remember our iniquities no more: and these things both concerning the meritorious sacrifice of Christ, and concerning the faithful promise of God, are knowne, and haue been made knowne vnto thee: Surely this temptation of accusing thoughts would long since haue receiued an answere, if there had not beene some roote of infidelitieBut where there is infidelitie, there may be faith. remaining in thee, to giue continuall nourishment vnto it. But because there is some infidelitie in thee, doth it

therefore follow, that there is no faith? That is not so: there may be both together either in his measure and degree. Doth not Saint Paul tell vs, that in himselfe, at the same time, there was one power which he calleth the Lawe of his minde, leading him to God and to the loue of his lawe, and an other power which hee calleth the lawe of his members, leading him from God: and leading him to sinne, his words are, I delight
                  Rom. 7. 22 
                  in the law of God concerning the innerman, but I see another law in my members, rebelling against the law of my mind, and leading mee captiue vnto the lawe of sinne which is in my members. Can anie things bee more opposite one to an other, then these two lawes of the mind and of the members, either striuing to draw the man in whom they remaine, a contrary way, the one to God, the other to sin? and yet they continue in the same man, at the same time, for his exercise, so long as hee liueth. The same Apostle telleth vs concerning euerie renewed seruant of GOD, that in him, at the same time, there remaineth, both naturall corruption, which he calleth

flesh, and infused grace, which he calleth Spirit, and either worketh, striuing each against other. His words are,Gala. 5. 1
                        •…
                     . 
                  The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrarie one to the other: so that yee can not doe the same things that yee would. The spirit in them, that is, infused grace, lusteth against corruption, to draw them vnto goodnesse, and the flesh in them, that is, naturall corruption, lusteth against grace, to draw them vnto wickednesse. Faith and infidelitie, the one being the worke of the spirit, the other the worke of flesh, are not more contrary one to another, then the flesh and spirit from whence they grow, and yet they are present together: therefore with thy infidelitie there may be faith in thee. The condition of a Christian man in his holy calling from darknesse vnto light, is like vnto the appearing of day after a darke night. It is a similitude much vsed by the holy Ghost in the Scriptures. Paul saith, The night is past,
                  Ro. 13. 12. 
                  the day is at hand: That is, the time of darkenesse, in which you erred altogether is past, and God hath sent his word

among you, by which, as by the light of the day, you may see the way to walke in. And in another place, Yee are all the
                  1. Thes. 5. 5 
                  children of light, and the children of the day, wee are not of the night, neither of darkenesse: That is, we liue not in ignorance, we walke not in ignorance, but God hath called vs to knowledge, and by the light thereof wee see the way before vs, and walke on safely in it. Now we all know, that when the day beginneth to breake, there is remaining a shadow of darkenesse a long time, and that first growing light, is farre from the cleare and ful light that shineth at noon day. But will any man say, that because of the remainder and mixture of darkenesse in the beginning of the day, that therefore there is no light at all? euery man would controule that assertion. Euen so, God shewing mercie to them that were shut vp in infidelitie, giueth them faith, which beginneth to growe like the day light, in the first breaking forth of it, and with some faith there remaineth much infidelitie. Shall any man therefore say, that because there is some infidelitie still remaining, there is no

faith at all; that saying were iniurious to the new conuerted and weake Saint, and it were an vnthankefull censure of Gods gracious worke begun. Remember what thou hast read in the Gospel, of the honest man, that came vnto the Lord Iesus, to intreat for his sonne that was possessed with a diuell: he said vnto our Sauiour, Lord I beleeue, helpe my vnbeliefe.
                  Mar. 9. 24. He professed his faith, while hee confessed his infidelity, he doubteth not of the presence of the one, because hee saw and felt the presence of the other: but knowing his faith to be tender and young, and his infidelitie to be old and strong, hee craueth the help of the Lord Iesus to weaken his infidelitie, and to strengthen his faith. Such altogether is thy case at this time, weake faith oppressed by strong infidelitie, strong infidelitie keeping the vpper hand of weake faith: say vnto the Lord Iesus as that man did, Lord I beleeue, helpe my vnbeliefe. And if thou thinkest his prayer to be defectiue, because hee onely craueth helpe against infidelitie, and desireth not increase of his faith, vnto the words of his petition, ioyne the words of the

petition, that the Apostles togetherLuke 17. 5 made vnto the Lord, saying, Lord encrease our faith. These words put together make a perfect praier for this peculiar grace, that the Lord Iesus, of whose fulnesse wee receiue grace for grace, will bee pleased to increase our faith, which we finde to bee weake, and to weaken our infidelitie, which wee finde to bee strong. This doe, and by the mercy of God, and goodnesse of our most milde Sauiour, thou shalt finde an happy alteration in good time growing; and thou shalt haue no cause to feare to die without faith, whensoeuer death shall come, yea though thou shouldest bee taken away before the full vanishing of this temptation, because he dieth not without faith, in whom, at his death, there is remaining some infidelitie; neither dieth he without hope, in whome at his departure, there is remayning some feare: and vnto God, thy couered, and almost smotherd faith wil appeare, whenIf the temptation hee once rightly ouercom it shall not returne after death. the same is hidden from thine owne feeling.
               But thou fearest death, not onely this way, least it should come before thou

haue wholy ouercome this temptation, but thou fearest it also, though there should be a ceasing of the temptation before, namely that after death this accusation may be renued, because (as thou saiest) the right time of preferring accusations against sinners is, when after death they appeare before the Lord in iudgement: and if the accusation now, while there is yet time of repentance, and hope of forgiuenes, 
                     •…
                  e so heauie and fearefull as thou doest finde it and feele it, it must needes be then much more heauie and fearefull, when there is left no time of repentance, nor any new course to be taken for the obteining of forgiuenes. To this I answere, that if once thou ouercome this temptation before death, thou needest not to feare the returne of it after death, if now it be ouercome and quenched rightly by such meanes as God hath appointed for the quieting of consciences, whereof it behoueth thee to be very carefull: for if thy temptation be ouercome by the knowledge and faith of the infinite mercy of God toward humble and contrite spirits, and of the vertuous mediation of

                  Iesus Christ that lambe of God that taketh away the sin of the world, gathered by harkening to the doctrine of the Gospel, which is the power of God to saluation: and if this knowledge and faith be accompanied with the loue of God, that is so mercifull a father, and of Iesus Christ that is so gratious a redeemer, and with the loue of thy brother, and with the hatred of sinne that is offensiue both to God and to thy brother, assure thy selfe that these accusing thoughts so silenced and quenched, shall not be reuiued after death: and thy peace so growen by knowledge and saith so accompanied, is not a deferring of this temptatiō vnto a fitter time, but a totall abolishing of it for euer. He that in this manner ouercommeth his accusing thoughts on earth, shall neuer heare of them before God in heauen. Wherefore else doeth the Lord Iesus say of the determination and censure of his seruants (to whom he hath committed the word of reconciliation) either assuring forgiuenes to the penitent beleeuer, or denouncing iudgement to the impenitent and vnbeleeuers? Whatsoeuer yee
                  Mat. 18. 18.
                  
                  binde on earth, shall be bound in heauen, and whatsoeuer yee loose on earth, shalbe loosed in heauen. Wherefore doeth hee speake thus of their determination and of their word, but that according to that good hope, which thou hast gathered vnto thy soule from the word of God, in the writings of his Prophets and Apostles, and in the mouthes of his faithfull witnesses on earth, according to that good hope hee will doe vnto thee in heauen. And in his iudgement, both at thy last day, and in the worlds last day, he will not varie one iot from the straight rule of his word whereon thy recouered peace is grounded.
               Indeede, if thou shouldest recouer thy peace, and remoue thy accusing thoughts with the remedie of Atheists, that like Dauids foole, Say in their hearts, there is

So did the Lord Iesus promise to the dying theese, when hee said vnto him, This day thou shalt bewith
                  Luke. 23. 43

                  out of the body, and to dwell with the Lord. Here is the change of the soules company; on earth it conuerseth with mortall men, in heauen it dwelleth euer with the immortall God. This is all the hurt that death can doe vnto vs (if this were to be called hurt) it bringeth the body to rest in the graue, and it bringeth the soule to present glorie with God, and all the dangerous deadly and killing power that originally it had, by any confederacie with sinne, all that is taken away by the death of Iesus Christ. And

if it were sometime to be feared as a poisoned serpent of the olde serpents brood, yet it is so spoiled by that serpent that was lifted vp vpon the crosse, that it hath neither tooth, nor sting, nor any poison left to hurt any beleeuer. Heare to this purpose the words of Saint Paul, O death where is thy sting? O graue
                  1. Cor. 15. 55. 
                  where is thy victorie? the sting of death is sinne, and the strength of sinne is the law: but thankes be vnto God, which hath giuen vs victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ. Death therefore cannot be hurtfull to the beleeuer. And if while he liue, he take such order, and find such fauour, that God will be pleased in Iesus Christ to send him a discharge of his sinnes by faith in his sonne, he hath no cause after death to feare the reuiuing of his accusation, though the legions of lying diuels, whose malice makes them accusers of the Saints before God, should altogecrie out against him, as Saint Paul teacheth vs saying. Who shall lay any thing to
                  Rom. 8. 33. 
                  the charge of Gods chosen? it is God that iustifieth, who shall condemne? it is Christ which is dead, yea or rather which is risen againe, who is also at the right hand of
                  
                  God, and maketh request also for vs. Thou hast no cause to feare death, or any thing that followeth death, if while thou liue thou returne to God, and recouer his fauour in Iesus Christ: for there is full discharge against accusation & condemnation (both in this life, and after this life) in the free loue of God, and most meritorious intercession of our Lord Iesus Christ.

But one thing hee hath cause to complaine of, and let vs heare him, that we may (vnderstanding his griefe) be the better able to helpe him. Hee telleth vs of a heauie case, his sleepe he saith, is not quiet, but mixt with fearefull dreames:

at his table his minde taketh in more sad thoughts, then his mouth doeth bits of meate: the voice and face of his old acquaintance and former friends doeth now reuiue his greefe, so oft as he doeth either see them, or heare them: the fairest roomes of his house, which he had trimmed vp for his delight, if hee come into them, doe strike him with grieuous terrour: and all those things that hee delighted in before, are new matter of sorrow and heauines vnto him, and it is his onely content (though without) to sit alone in darknesse. This hee taketh to be some curse of God folowing him, and an euident signe of Gods iust and fearefull anger following him: for what should make Gods good creatures, (other mens comforts) to be discomforts to him, but the onely displeasure of God?
               To this I answer, that it is very likelyAnswere to this obiection. that it is so, and will continue to bee so with him, so long as this burden of accusing thoughts lies heauy, remaining vpon his wounded conscience. It is a very kindly effect of it, that hath growen out of it, and wil vanish with it. Thou

sleepest & catest, with a wounded heart; and hence it is, that while thou sleepest and eatest, thou still feelest the smart of thy wounded heart. Thy ancient friends and former woonted delights appeare vnto thee now, when thou art not fit to take pleasure in them, as before time thou didst, and that maketh thee at the present to be the more troubled, thinking vpon thine old liberty now lost. And the things prepared for thy pleasure while thou wert capable of pleasure in the contrary disposition of thine heart, (bent altogether to feare and sorrow) doe now bring 
                     •…
                  orth a contrary effect vnto thee, euen increase of sorrow. And a desire of shaddow and solitarienesse (though they be hurtfull) doth follow a grieued minde, as Ieremy saith of the man that beareth the yoke in his youth, Hee sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because
                  I. am. 3. 28. 
                  he hath borne it vpon him. And this desire of darknesse and solitarinesse, either is an effect of mortification in him that is crucified to the world (seeing the world crucified to him) or else it groweth, partly out of shame, and partly out of anger, that things are in no better

tune: and vpon the recouering of thy peace, and ceasing of thy temptation, this trouble will certainly vanish away. In the meane time, giue place to this griefe as little as thou canst, and striue to reioyce in the Lord, and in the good blessings hee hath bestowed vpon thee, & pray him that bestowed good things vpon thee, to giue thee a free heart to take comfort in his guiftes, that thou maiest be prouoked to praise his name. And withall, craue and vse the counsell and helpe of some learned and skilfull Physician, for there is somthing in this griefe, that hath neede of his iudgement and diligence. And the God of hope fill

                  ase, it hath beene shewed and proued. First, that his sinne, not being that sinne that is called blasphemy against the holy Ghost, is a pardonable sinne, though certainly worthy of a thousand damnations. According to that saying of Christ in the gospel, Verily I say vnto you,
                  Mark. 3. 28 
                  all sinnes shalbe forgiuen to the children of men and blasphemies wherewith they blaspheme. Secondly, that the Lord Iesus Christ hath commanded him, and by his commandement, giuen him leaue to aske forgiuenesse of sinnes, and hath drawen for him a forme of petition, by which to craue that forgiuenesse of our heauenly Father, when he taught him in the Gospel to say, Forgiue vs our sinnes,

                     •…
                  ling of this burden vpon God, are these. First, that without deniall, excu sing, or extenuating of his sinne, he doe ingenuously and fully confesse vnto God his sinne, saying with the Prophet in the Psalme, Against thee, against
                  Psal. 51. 4, 
                  thee onely haue I sinned, and done euill in thy sight. For hee that seeketh by any meanes to hide, extenuate, or excuse his sinne before God, as if he had not offended, or had not deserued wrath by his offence, shall not bee pardoned, but he that freely confesseth,

shall finde fauour. Salomon saith in thePro. 28. 13. Prouerbs, He that hideth his sinnes, shal not prosper, but he that confesseth and forsaketh them, shal haue mercy. Secondly, let him patiently beare, and without all murmuring, the stroke of Gods hand, which his confessed sins conuince him to be most worthy of, and let him say with the Church, I will beare the wrath
                  Mic. 7. 9. 
                  of the Lord because I haue sinned against him. For murmuring & impatience prouoketh God more. The Prophet saith thus of God, With the froward thou wilt
                  Psa. 18. 26. 1. Pet. 5. 6. 
                  shew thy selfe froward. But patience winneth fauour at Gods hands for deliuerance. The Apostle Peter saith: Humble your selues vnder the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. Thirdly, he must now hate sinne that hath bin so chargeable vnto him, and inquire after the will of God, and do it. As Saint Peter likewise teacheth vs saying, amend
                  Act. 3. 19. 
                  your liues and turne, that your sinnes may bee done away. For hee that continueth with delight in sinne shal neuer finde fauour, but heapeth vp more wrath vnto himselfe, against the day of wrath: thePsa. 11. 5. Prophet saith, Him that loueth iniquity
                  
                  doth his soule hate. A fourth aduice is, that hee haue compassion vpon his fellow seruant, and forgiue the offences of his brother, putting from him all purpose of seeking reuenge for iniuries receiued. As Saint Paul aduiseth saying, Forbearing one another, and forgiuing one
                  Col. 3. 13. 
                  another, if any man haue a quarrell to another. For he that hath no pitty vpon his brother, and exacteth satisfaction of him, shall finde no pitty with God, and shall be solde to pay the vttermost farthing of his owne debt. As the Lord Iesus hath plainly said, If ye doe not forgiue
                  Mat. 6. 15. 
                  men their trespasses, no more will your father forgiue you your trespasses. A fifth aduice is, that he in
                     •…
                  orme himselfe daily more and more of the mercy of God, & merits of Iesus Christ, by searching the Scriptures, that doe beare witnesse therto, that he may by this meanes grow to beleeue in God, whereunto the written word affordeth great helpe for the saying of Iohn is true of all the Scriptures. These things are written that yee might beleeue.
                  Ioh. 20. 31. And without faith that staieth our mindes vpon God in the merit of his son there is no accesse vnto God, as wee are

taught by the Apostle saying, Without
                  Heb. 11. 6. 
                  faith it is vnpossible to please God. Lastly, he must with sighes and grones, with humble and harty praiers, solicite the maiesty of God continually, that he will be pleased to respect him with fauour, and to forgiue his sinnes; as the Prophet Hosea teacheth vs, saying, O Israel, returne vnto the Lord thy God, for thou
                  Hos. 14. 1. 
                  hast fallen by thine iniquity: take vnto you words, and turne to the Lord, and say vnto him, take away all iniquity, and receiue vs graciously, so will wee render the calues of our lips. The neglect of this duty of praying to God, is esteemed to be a marke of a wicked man: For of them whom he calleth workes of iniquity, the Prophet saith, They call not vpon God. In thesePsal. 53. 4.

                  ew rules of confession, patience, repentance, loue, faith, and praier, standes the right casting of this burden vpon God. These things let him practise constantly, and God will ease his wearied conscience. And thus haue we declared, what burdens are heere meant; and what it is to cast euery such burden vpon God.

For all the precepts, instructions, & directions God giues, are precepts, instructions, & directions of holines, iustice and wisdome, that can not either hurtfully or fruitlesly mis-leade vs.Iob 21. 14. The wicked say to God, Depart from vs, for wee desire not the knowledge of thy waies: who is the Almightie that wee should serue him? and what profit should we haue, if we should pray vnto him? and the Prophet Malachie chargeth the wicked of his time to haue spoken stout words against God in this manner; Yee
                  Mala. 3 24 
                  haue said, it is in vaine to serue God, and what profit is it that we haue kept his commaundements, and that wee walked humbly before the Lord of hostes? Therefore wee count the prowd blessed, euen they that worke wickednesse are set vp, and they that tempt God, yea they are deliuered: this is

the opinion of the wicked, that the commandements, instructions, and directions of God, carry with them no assurance of good successe: they can deuise and appoint more safely and more profitably for themselues. But God saith to the righteous that hearken to his courses, and follow his commaundements, that when hee hath done according to justice and goodnesse, both to the one sort, and to the other, then shall you returne,
                  Mala. 3. 18 
                  and discerne betweene the righteous and wicked, betweene him that serueth God, and him that serueth him not. Gods iudgement shall make a sensible difference betweene them, while the wicked miscarry and perish, that despised his counsel: & the godly prosper that follow his counsell. For of all the counsel, and of all the commandements of God, thePsa. 19. 11 Prophet Dauid saith, By them is thy seruant made circumspect, and in keeping of them there is great reward. For when a man doth honour GOD by his obedience, as a iust commaunder, and a wise aduiser: then out of his goodnesse hee furthereth and strengtheneth that good successe that dependeth vpon his rule.

Hearken then vnto the voyce of God, follow his holy direction, and all things shall goe well with thee.

The promise hath two parts. The whole is deliuered by Dauid in such words, as might most fittely answer to those burdens, that at that time lay most heauie vpon his owne soule: that, as hauing recouered comfort to himselfe, he

                  e him warning to slie, he left all that hee had, and came in bare estate to the house of Ahimelech the Priest, and of him obtained the sword of Goliah (for

hee brought not with him, for haste, so much as a weapon of his owne) and certaine loanes of shew bread for him and for his men. From thence he fled to Achish king of Gath, but durst not staie there. Then came he into the wild countrey of Iuda, a place of no plenty: there his number increased daily to the increase of his necessitie: and the inhabitants became his enemies, not relieuing his want, but betraying him and his haunts to Saul▪
                   Where while he stayed, there fell out a notable thing, that sheweth how pouerty pinched him. There was a certaine rich man named Nabal, that sheared his sheepe, and prepared great cheere for his shearers. To him Dauid sent tenne yoong men with this message giuen to them; Goe to Nabal,
                  1. Sa. 25. 5. 
                  and aske him in my name how hee doth, and thus shall you say for salutation, Both thou and thine house, and all that thou hast be in peace, wealth, and prosperitie. Behold, I haue heard that thou hast shearers: now thy sheepeheards were with vs, and wee did them no hurt, neither did they misse anie thing all the while they were in Carmel: aske thy seruants, and they will shew thee.
                  
                  Wherefore let these yong men finde fauour in thine eyes (for wee come in a good season) giue I pray thee what soeuer commeth to thine hand, vnto thy seruants, and to thy sonne Dauid. This petition, to beg from a churles dinner, fauoureth of no great abundance: and when he was repulsed of Nabal▪
                   and his yoong men returned empty, bringing nothing to him from Nabal, but churlish words, he became sodainly inraged, and armed foure hundred men, and went that euening with them, with resolution to slay the churle, and all that belonged to him before the morning, which hee had certainely done, if hee had not beene met, and staied in the way by Abigail the prudent wife of Nabal. Now wee knowe what maketh the lion to roare, and the wolfe to be furious, euen hunger, when they seeke for their prey. And had not Dauid beene at that time a hungry lion, if his state without touch of want could haue borne that repulse of Nabal, hee could neuer haue resolued vpon so violent and cruell a course. This historie most clearely sheweth, that at this time a heauy burden of a poore estate pressed

his soule. Therefore in setting downe this promise, hee vseth words of incouragement to others, that agree fittely with his own condition, and serue conueniently to confirme his owne hope.
               And as hee was poore, so also he wasHis other burdē was a fall from his former honour. fallen from the honour that hee lately enioyed in Israel, and in a manner lay deiected at the feete of his enemies, to be trampled vppon. For hee had beene a great man in the Court of Saul, and in the eyes of all Israel. First in his Fathers house, and in the middest of his brethren, by Samuel sent of God, hee was annointed to be King in Israel. Secondly, when the euill spirit, sent of God to vexe Saul did inuade him, and he was in the fits of his furie, then Dauid was sent for to the Court, and plaied on his Harpe before Saul, and procured him ease, and a ceasing of his fits, for the euill spirit departed from Saul. Thirdly, when a battell was betweene Israel and the Philistims, and there came forth daily, out of the hoste of the Philistims, a mighty man named Goliah, of the town of Gath, and defied Israel, from whom al the people fled: then Dauid accepted

the Philistims challenge, and slew him, and put away the shame from Israel, for which honorable fact, the women praised him in their Song, say

Fourthly, Saul made him a captaine ouer a thousand men▪ and whithersoeuer Dauid led them forth, he behaued himselfe wisely, and valiantly; for the Lord was with him, and made him to prosper, and all Israel loued him. Lastly, Saul gaue him one of his daughters to wife, and hee became the Kings sonne in lawe: and hee did eate meate at Sauls Table: and Ionathan Sauls sonne, made a true league of amitie with him, and all the gallants of the Court regarded him. Such had beene the standing of Dauid in a loft

                  Ionathan, from the Court, the Cittie, and the Tabernacle; from his honourable office, companie, and estate, hee was glad to she, and to slie into the wildernesse, into woods, and caues and holes to hide his head;

where the company that he had, resembled the place in basenesse. For (besides those of his fathers house) there gathered vnto him, men that were in trouble for their euill deeds, that brought them within danger of law: men that were in debt, and owed more then they were worth, and durst not shew their heads: & men that were troubled in mind, oppressed with sorrow, affrighted with feares: this was his companie, as it were the skumme of the people, a rout of lawlesse ones. He was in the Kings displeasure: and the Kings eares were euer open to all malicious and slanderous reports made against Dauid: and vpon euery discouerie of Dauids abiding in any place, Saul was euer running forth with his armie against him. Thus was he fallen from that height of honour in which sometimes hee stoode. And the promise of Gods helpe, and of ease from God, that hee giueth to them that cast their burden vpon GOD, hee deliuereth and putteth downe in such words as are fitly answerable to his owne present condition, fallen into such disgrace (hee will not suffer the righteous to fall for

                  BVT forasmuch as he deliuerethThe first part of this promise is the poore mans promise. this promise for the incouragement of others, let vs so handle it, as that others may see their interest in it. And hee shall nourish thee, he will not suffer the righteous to fall for euer. This promise falleth of it selfe into two parts, the first is in these words, And he shall nourish thee: the seis in these words, He will not suffer the righteous to fall for euer. The first part of this promise meeteth with the burden of pouertie and want in this present world, and therefore may be called the poore mans promise, who doeth not looke high about the point of nourishment and doeth not complaine except he feele some want thereof. In the poore mans house are not heard the complaint,

that great men make, as that the King frowneth vpon him, and hee is forbidden to come into his presence: that his child is stollen from him, and meanely maried against his liking: that hee hath lost a great estate by the wracke of such a ship, by the breaking of such a tradesman, and by the falsehood of such a seruant. These

                  nd such like are the complaints of great men, and neuer heard in poore mens houses, but their complaints are commonly these: I am not able to pay my debt, I am not ready to pay my rent, and I feare to be cast into prison for the one, and to be throwen out of my house for the other: I haue no prouision against the colde winter, nor money in my house to make prouision: the raine beates in at euery corner of my house, and I am not able to repaire it: my wife, my selfe and children want both meate and clothes, and winter comes on vpon vs: and these hard times affoord much expence, and little getting: charitie is become cold, and her benummed hands now giue no almes: Iustice also is growen very sleepie, and scarce holdes vp her head to

reckon with the labourer, and to giue him his hire: and how wee shalbe fed, clothed and nourished, I can not tell▪ These are the poore mans complaints, and this promise meeteth with these complaints, and assureth nourishment, and therefore it may very well be called the poore mans promise.
               For the truth of this promise, thatGod will nourish his poore that attend vpon his hand. God will nourish them that cast their burden of want vpon him, that is, attend reuerently in well doing vpon his hand for maintenance, it appeareth plainely by the Lords bountie, hee gaue vntoHe sendeth inough for all in generall. 
                  Adam and vnto his posteritie, all the fruites of the earth, and all the hearbes of the field, hee gaue vnto Noah and to his sonnes, all liuing things that breede and liue, either in the aire, or vpon the land, or in the sea: this large grant is registred by Moses, saying, The feare of

Heere is prouision inough, feare not want: the great depths of the sea, the spread plaines of the earth, and the vast compasse of the aire, are Gods store houses, filled with foode and prouision of all kindes for thee: so that there must be no fish in the sea, no fowles flying through the aire, neither hearbe, fruit nor beast vpon the face of the earth, if there be no foode for thee. Yea all liuing creatures must want foode before man can want foode, because euen all those other creatures are appointed and giuen to man to be his foode.God sendeth inough for all, but couetousnes intercepteth it, and the p

Thou confessest that God in this world, as a great Lord in his familie, maketh prouision and allowance fully and plentifully: but men as vnfaithfull stewards, make vnequall diuisions,

Therefore doeth he challenge it to be his worke, when any becommeth rich, or remaineth poore, when any is filled with his blessings or remaineth emptie: and the saithfull doe so acknowledge it. Hanna the mother of Samuel

                  aith of him, The Lord maketh poore, and maketh rich, bringeth low and exalteth. Yea God doeth challenge it to be the worke of his hand, guided by iudgement and mercy, for the good of his Saints and seruants, that feeling their

wants, doe seeke their maintenance of him, casting this their burden vpon him, as they haue before beene taught, The Prophet Esay testifieth so much plainely vnto vs▪ hauing these words. Thus saith
                  Esay 65. 13 
                  the Lord God, behold, my seruants shall eate and you shalbe hungry (he speaketh to idolaters) behold my seruants shall drinke, and yee shall be thirstie▪ behold my seruants shall reioice, & yee shall be ashamed. So that if thou continue to serue God faithfully in thy place, thou shalt bee nourished, and hee will fill thy heart with foode and gladnes, when wicked men shall want: yea the Prophet Dauid knowing the care that God hath of his, is bold to say, In the daies of famine, they
                  Psal. 37. 19. 
                  shall haue inough. Yea God will performe this, the godly poore that depend vpon him, whē he is rich & wealthy, that seem to haue the world at will, & to be Lords of plentie and aboundance, shall want and suffer penurie as the blessed virgin Mary the mother of our Lord Iesus, out of her obseruation, testifieth in herLuke 1. 53. holy song, saying, Hee hath filled the hungry with good things, and sent away the rich emptie. Consider these things, and

thou shalt see, that hee that sendeth inough for all in generall, will send also inough for thee in particular: and he that sendeth it for thee, will also conuey it to thee, & so conuey it that thou shalt receiue it, and vse it, and shalt be nourished with it, and see his goodnesse, and haue cause to praise him for thy portion, when others of wealthier estate, shall want, or in their abundance shall not be kindely nourished, their abundance prouing vnto them, as the dainty Quailes proued to the lusting Israelites, wherwith they were choked while they fed vpon them.
               For a perfect conclusion of this discourse, that God will nourish them, that in their wants doe wait vpon his hand for their food and maintenance, I will adde that diuine sermon of our Sauiour Christ in the Gospel of Saint Mathew,
                  Mat. 6. 15. 
                  I say vnto you, be not carefull for your life, what yee shall eat, or what yee shall drinke, nor for your bodies, what you shall put on: is not the life more worth then meat? and the body then raiment? His Argument is this, God hath giuen vs our bodies more worth then clothes, and he hath

giuen vs our life more worth then meat: and finding him bountifull in bestowing the greater things, why should wee distrust his goodnesse in the smaller things? Then follows in the same place, Behold the fowles of heauen, for they sow
                  Mat. 6. 26. 
                  not, neither reape, nor carry into the barns, yet your heauenly father feedeth them: are yee not much better then they? which of you by taking care is able to adde one cubit vnto his stature? His arguments in these words are two, the first is this: God feedeth those creatures, to whom hee hath giuen no skill at all to make prouision for themselues, and they are also vile and of no price in his sight: then why should we that are precious in his eies, and to whom hee hath also giuen meanes and skill to make prouision, and to lay vp for our vse, why should wee distrust his goodnesse? His second argument is this: our distracting care can effect nothing, therefore it is vaine for vs to take care: and it is good and safe quietly to rest vpon him. He addeth further in that speech, And why care yee for
                  Mat. 6. 28. 
                  raiment? learne how the Lillies of the field doe grow, they labour not, neither spin, yet
                  
                  I say vnto you, that euen Salomon in all his glory, was not araied like one of these: wherefore, if God so cloathe the grasse of the field, which is to day, and tom rrow is cast into the ouen, shall hee not doe much more vnto you, O yee of little faith? For apparrell, one part of our care, his argument is as before for food: God beautifully clotheth the grasse, that hath not skill to prouide or fashion apparrell for it selfe, and it is also vile in his sight: then why should wee that are precious in his sight, and haue both meanes and skill to prouide and fashion clothes for our backes, why should wee distrust his prouidence. Lastly, he addeth, Therefore
                  Mat. 6. 31. 
                  take no thought, saying, what shall we eat? or what shal we drinke? or wherewith shall we be clothed? (for after these things seeke the Gentiles) for your heauenly father knoweth that yee haue neede of these things: but seeke yee first the kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse, and all these things shall bee ministred vnto you.

                     •…
                  eathenish to take such care for these thing, therefore it is vncomely

for Christians to take such care. Secondly, the giuer of all things, that careth for vs, knowes our wants, therefore wee neede not to afflict our selues with care for them. Lastly, the sure way of obtaining these things at the hands of God, is (not to take thought for them but) in our calling to obey God in righteousnesse, that hee may reigne in our hearts. If we take care of this, then God without our care will prouide vs of all necessaries. Such is the Diuine sermon of our Sauiour Christ, assuring vs that God will nourish vs.

                  eth contented. The second part of the promise followeth in these words, He wil not suffer the righteous to fall for euer. These words answer aptly to his fall from that

height of honor, wherein he lately stood in Israel. And being by him deliuered to other cares, it serueth them more generally, to assure them of recouery from euery fall. And therefore it may well be called the common promise, giuen for the comfort of all men, that are born downe by, and fallen vnder the weight of any burden.

                  Pro. 24. 16. 
                  times a day, & riseth againe, not so often falling still in the same kind, but diuersly falling in seuerall kinds, and obtaining helpe to rise againe from euery fall: and these many falles may be reduced vnto two generall heads, for either a man falleth into sinne, or hee falleth into some misery and trouble that sinne maketh our life to be subiect vnto. And vnder these two names of sinne and misery, we will speake of these falles, and consider how true this promise is, that GOD

will not suffer the righteous to fall for euer.
               The first of these falles, is our fallingOne kinde of

                      to fall by sin. into sinne. For the commandements of God, being (as so many paths) beaten out before our faces; for vs to walke in, he that keepeth them, is as one that walketh vprightly with God: and hee that transgresseth and breaketh them, is as one that stumbleth in his way and falleth downe flat, to his great danger. Therefore doe we call Adams sinne, the fall of Adam. Therefore doe we call the lighter errours of the Saints their slidings, and their grosser errours we call their falles. And this name of fall is giuen to the sinne that we commit by the Prophet Hosea, saying, O Israel, returne

                        •…
                      hast fallen by thine iniquity. This is a dangerous kinde of fall, whereof it behoueth vs to take great heede. Heli the Priest fell from the seat whereon he sate, & brake his necke: Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab King of Israel, fell thorow the Lattisewindow in his vpper chamber, and brused his body, whereof he died. Yet is not such a fall, as either of them haue taken,

any thing neere so dangerous, as to fall into sinne. This fall of sinne made the Angels fall out of Heauen, and out of the fauour of God irrecouerably. And it made our first parents fall out of Paradise, and from that bl

And many of their posterity, by salling into sinne, doe fall from God, and sinke downe into hell, and there perish eternally. It behoueth all men therefore to take heed of it, as the Apostle aduiseth saying, Let him that
                  1. Cor. 10. 12 
                  standeth, take heede lest hee fall. There is no man of so sure footing, that can walke steedily in Gods commandements, without sliding and falling: for as Sant Iames saith, In many things we sinne
                  Iam. 3. 2. 
                  all. And the more weake our footing is, the more warily we had need looke vnto our waies, that as much as is possible, we may escape falles: especially considering how dangerous it is, in this kind to fall.He raiseth by repentance them that are fallen by sinne.

                  et such is the mercy of God, that he will not suffer the righteous to fal for euer, but in due time, hee will raise vp them by repentance that are fallen by

                     •…
                  ein we should goe: and sendeth vnto vs his messengers with that word in their mouthes, that they may be our guides: to that end he prepareth our eares for the hearing, and our hearts for the vnderstanding of that word, that we may learne and profit thereby. After this he humbleth our will and bringeth into order all our affections, that our knowledge may not be idle, for want of willing obedience. And because neither knowledge nor willingnesse are able (by reason of our weaknesse) to effect any thing without him, he also strengthneth vs, and worketh in vs what hee would haue wrought by vs. As the ApostlePhi. 2. 13. speaketh. It is God which worketh in you both the will and the deede out of his good pleasure. Thus he proceedeth in his good worke to raise vp by true repentance, them that were fallen by their sinnes. And to assure vs there of, that we may with comfort hope for the helpe of his grace, when our weaknes hath made vs fall into sinne. Hee hath giuen vs many gracious promises. For thus hee

saith in the Psalme, I will instruct thee
                  Psa. 32. 8. 
                  and teach thee in the way that thou shalt goe, and I will guide thee with mine eie. Thus hee promiseth in the Prophecy of Ieremy, I will put my law in their inward
                  Ie
                        •…
                     . 31. 33. 
                  parts, and write it in their hearts. And thus hee speaketh by the Prophet Ezekiel. Then will I powre cleane water vpon
                  Eze. 36. 25. 
                  you, and you shall be cleane; yea from all your filthinesse, and from all your idols will I clense you: a new heart also will I giue you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your body, and I will giue you a heart of flesh: and I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walke in my statutes, and yee shal keepe my iudgements and doe them. These and many such gracious promises hath God giuen vnto vs, to assure vs, that when the righteous fall into sinne, hee will raise them vp againe by repentance. Hence haue issued the calling of the Gentiles, and the conuersion of all vnbeleeuers, that for many succeeding ages liued in ignorance and sinne, and yet in the end obtayned mercy to returne to God by repentance. Hence hath issued the regeneration and new

birth of the Saints, that being originally shut vp in vnbeleefe, and naturally dead in trespasses and sinnes, haue beene quickned by Gods grace, and begotten againe by the word of truth to be the first fruits of his creatures: and by his mercifull worke haue been brought out of darknesse vnto his glorious light, to liue thenceforth, not as children of darknesse and of the night, but as children of the light and of the day. Hence hath this issued, euen that God will not suffer the righteous to fall for euer: and from their daily slidings hee doth raise them, that when they haue sinned as Adams children, they may repent and amend as the children of God. The Prophet saith in the Psalme, The secret of the Lord is reuealed to them that feare him, and his couenant to giue them vnderstanding. Let the righteous therefore, that either finde their owne ignorance, in mischoosing their way, or feele their owne weakenesse in walking in their way, let them pray vnto God for grace, that he will not suffer them to erre, and fall for euer: and let them say vnto God with the Prophet, Teach mee thy way O
                  
                  God, and leade me in a right path. This is the first kinde of fall to fall into sinne, and it is the worst, because it draweth with it the second kinde of fall, which is to fall into misery.

                  THE second kinde ofThe second kind of fall is to fall into miserie for sinne. fall, in which God will not suffer the righteous to fall for euer, is an effect of the former, produced by the iust iudgment of God, namely a falling into misery. This kinde of fall, mankinde had neuer beene acquainted withall, if they had not taken the first fall, for if man had neuer sinned against God, God would neuer haue suffered man to haue felt any misery. This kind of fall into misery is of infinite variety, no man can number the seuerall miseries and troubles, that sinne hath made our life subiect vnto:These miseries are of two sortes inward a

                  with blindnesse, and astonishment of heart, when a man is amased and confounded with his feares, that hee knoweth not which way to turne him for comfort and helpe, and deepe fallen into this miserie were they whom Esay speaketh of saying. The sinnes in Sion are afraid, a
                  Esay. 33. 14. 
                  feare is come vpon the hipocrites: who among vs shall dwell with the deuouring fire? who among vs shall dwell with the euerlasting burnings: They conceiued no otherwise of God then of a consuming fire, and therefore feare possessed altogither their hearts, hope vanished, faith had no abiding there. And all these inward miseries, falling immediately vpon the soule, and the facultie thereof, tend chiefely to this, to ouerthrow our faith, & by decay of it to ouerthrow vs, for faith is the firme standing of our soule, grounded vpon the assurance of Gods mercy. Therefore doeth the Apostle vse this phrase. Watch you, stand
                  1. Cor. 16. 13. 
                  fast in the faith, quit you like men, and be strong. Because he that hath the stronger faith, standeth the more strong and steadfast, and hee that hath the weaker faith,

standeth more weakely and loose, and thoug the faith of the Saints of God, once giuen vnto them, neuer totally decaieth, (for as the Lord Iesus saith, hee praied for the continuance and confirmation of Peters faith, to whom he said, I haue praied for thee, that thy faith faile
                  Luke. 22. 32. 
                  not. So he praied for all his chosen ones that beleeue in him, when he said to his father. I pray not for these alone, but for
                  Iohn. 17. 20. 
                  them also, which shall beleeue in mee thorough their word) Yet the faith of the Saintes suffereth sometimes an eclipse or deceasing, & at some other times an increasing whereby as in the increasing of their faith they stand fast and are full of comfort, so in the deceasing of their faith their footing becommeth slipperie, and they take many sore falles, & feele their hearts oppressed with feare: as it was with Dauid, when he cried out, My God
                  Psal. 22. 1. 
                  my God, why hast thou forsaken mee, and art so far from my health, and from the words of my roaring. And when he complained at another time, saying, Mine
                  Psal. 55. 4. 
                  heart trembleth within mee, and the terrors of death are fallen vpon mee: feare and trembling are come upon mee, and an
                  
                  horrible feare hath couered mee. In this manner, their faith at that time being in the wane, the righteous oppressed with a weight of anguish and feare, doe often fall through the shrinking of their faith, and feele themselues sore bruised in their soules.
               But yet such is the mercy of God thatHe raiseth them vp that are fallen into these inward miseries. he doeth not suffer the righteous, being fallen into these inward iudgements and miseries, to fall for euer. And if it be a blinded vnderstanding, or a hardned heart, that they are fallen into, he raiseth them vp out from a blinded vnderstanding by sending the knowledge of the

                  Eze. 36. 26. 
                  will take away the ston

                   terror of conscience, he raiseth them vp by repairing their faith, and by reuiuing their comfort. To that end he bringeth

to their remembrance the large promises of his grace, the boundles measure of his mercy, the riches of his free & vnchangeable loue: and then doeth hee make them remember, that they haue a mediator that died for their sinnes, and rose againe for their iustification, and ascended into heauen to prepare a place for them, and sitteth on the right hand of his father, in highest fauour and greatest authoritie, to make intercession for them, continually vrging the vertue of his death and bloudshedding, that hath taken away the sinne of the world, who is the prince of peace, that hath made their peace, and is that beloued sonne in whom the father is well pleased, making vs accepted in that his beloued. To the same end doeth he spread the beames of his louing countenance, and cause the light thereof to shine within their consciences, sending downe the spirit of adoption into their hearts, to beare witnes with their spirits, that they are the sonnes of God: so raking together the sparkes of their almost smothered faith, from among the cold ashes of anguish and feare, where it lay deepe couered,

giuing heate and life vnto it with the warming fire of his comfort: so that they begin to lift vp their heads, and to reioice their hearts, and to shake of their their sorrow and feare, and to glorie in God, saying with the blessed virgin, My
                  Luke 1. 46 
                  soule magnifieth the Lord▪ and my spirit reioiceth in God my Sauiour. And with the Prophet Dauid, Thou hast tnrned my
                  Psal. 30. 11. 
                  mourning into ioy, thou hast loosed my sacke, and girded mee with gladnes. And that God doeth thus, not suffring the righteous to fall and languish in these inward miseries for euer, besides the experience of Gods elect, daily renewed with light and grace, and daily refreshed with comfort and peace, the scriptures also doe testifie it to be the gracious manner of Gods dealing with his chosen. The Prophet saith of him. Hee healeth
                  Psal. 147 3. 
                  those that are broken in heart, and bindeth vp their soares. These words can be referred to no other worke of God: for the more sure and full performance whereof, God sent his sonne into the world, who came to call sinners vnto repentance, and to seeke and saue them that were lost, giuing repentance vnto

Israel and remission of sinnes, so lifting vp them that were fallen downe, by any inward iudgement of God, any way punishing them in their soules for their first fall into sinne.
               This was the inward miserie, vpon theWhat are the outward miseries whereunto men fall. inward man, whereunto men fall that haue fallen into sinne. There is another miserie into which men fal for their sins, God in his iust iudgement thrusting them forward, which I call outward misery, because it is not the stroke of the heart, though the heart afterward be grieued for it. This kinde of outward misery into which men fall is full of varietie, & vnder one head there are diuers branches contained: for some of these fall vpon vs by the good worke of God to trie vs, to exercise our faith, to correct and humble vs: and some doe fall vpon vs by the malice and in iustice of men and Angels, to ouerthrow vs in our faith or our pietie (as the diuell hoped by Iobes losses to make him blaspheme God) or at the least to vexe and grieue vs, and to make vs murmur: so differing in regard of the author from whom they come, and of the end for which they

come. They differ also in regard of the subiect matter of them, for some of these outward miseries happen to vs in our name and credit, wounded and impaired by lying, standering, and the spite of euill tongues: or they happen to vs in our bodies, & reach euen to the danger of our liues, by sores and sickenesses, by blowes and bruises, by maimes and woundes: on they happen to vs in our estate & goodes, when we are deceiued, robbed, spoiled, & deposed from offices of profit and worship: or they happen to vs in our libertie, when we are banished from our natiue countrie, or confined to some restrained boundes which wee must not passe, as Salomon confined Shemei to his house in Ierusalem, or we are committed to some prison: or they happen to vs in our friends, by death taken away from vs, that were our maintenance, our countenance; our credite, and safegarde, and they being remoued, we are left naked and Orphans in a pittiles world. By which outward miseries (of so great, and greater varietie) we fall from estimation and lone of the people, from health, strength, and beautie, from

riches and plentie, from freedome and libertie, from comfort and refuge, into suspicion and an euill name, into weakenes and leanenes, into pouertie, thraldome, and much contempt: and aduantage is giuen vnto our aduersaries, to insult and glory ouer vs, and many men haue beene dangerously bruised with such falles of this kinde.God raiseth them that are fallen into these outward miseries.
               
               But yet such is the mercy and goodnes of God, that hee will not suffer the righteous (fallen into these miseries) to fall for euer, but in due time he will raise them vp, and deliuer them. The slander of Susanna was wiped away, and shee was discharged of the fowle imputation, laied vpon her by the wicked Elders, with honorable repaire of her credit. The imprisonment and affliction of Ioseph after some yeares was done away, and he was brought forth and made a great commander in the land of Egipt. Iob was spoiled of his goodes, robbed of his children, miserably afflicted in his body, and brought most low, for hee could not fall more low, and liue; but God did graciously restore Iob in all his losses, and he ended his daies in

honor and peace. Mordechai and the Iewes, by the wicked deuise of Haman, were fallen deepely into contempt and danger of death, yet by the meanes of Hester it pleaseth God, to cast downe their enemies into destruction, and to raise vp the Iewes, both to repaired credit, and to secured life. Saint Paul confesseth writing to the Corinthians, that being in Asia, hee was with afflictions and sicknes, Pressed out of measur

                  2. Cor. 1. 8 
                  strength, so that he altogether doubled euen of life, yea he receiued the sentence of death in himselfe. But when he was fallen and brought so low, God raised him vp by restoring health, and would not suffer the righteous Apostle to lie foreuer, as also he confesseth in the next words, saying, God which raiseth the dead, deliuered me from so great a death, and doeth deliuer me, in whom I trust that he will yet deliuer mee. I might easily fill many leaues with examples of the rightsous seruants of God, whom being fallen into these outward miseries, hee mercifully raised vp but I will forbeare, and remember only a testimonie or two, that manifestly shew, how God in these, as in other

kindes of falles, though hee suffer the righteous to fall, yet he doeth not suffer them to fall for euer, but will raise them vp and reduce them to a better estate. Heereto pertaine the words of Eliphaz, speaking of the almighty. He maketh the
                  Iob. 5. 1
                        •…
                     . 
                  wound and bindeth it vp, hee smiteth and his hands make whole: hee shall deliuer thee in six troubles, and in the seuenth the euill shall not touch thee: in famine he shall deliuer thee from death, and in battell from the power of the sword. Thou shalt be hid from the snare of the tongue, and thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it commeth: but thou shalt laugh at destruction and death, &c. If God send the euill, he will send the remedie: if he send danger, he will send deliuerance: if hee affright with feare, hee will comfort with saluation: if he cast downe, he will raise vp againe, and will not suffer the righteous to fall for euer. And he will doe this not at one time alone, but at all times: not in one manner of miserie alone, but in all kindes of miseries. The Prophet Dauid saith of this mercifull worke of Gods hands raising vp out of miseries. Great
                  Psal. 34. 19. 
                  are the troubles of the righteous, but the
                  
                  Lord deliuereth him out of them all,
               
               And if happily this be not effected inIf not in this life, yet most certainly after this life. this world, and during this life, yet most certainely God doth raise vp the righteous that were falne, and frees them from all, both outward and inward miseries in an other world, and after this life. The Prophet Esay doth tell vs, that when the righteous perish (for so the world censureth their death) and when mercifullEsay 57. 1 men are taken away, then the righteous is taken away from the euills to come r
                     •…
                   their death is a full deliuering of them from al troubles, and therefore a lifting of them vp from all the miseries into which they were fallen. And for proofe hereof, it is most cleere, that the Lord Iesus reporteth of the poore Lazarus, in the gospel of Saint Luke, that man was fallen lowe into the pit of pouertie, so that hee was compelled to begge for his maintenance at other mens doores: and he was fallen as deepe into the gaping gulfe of sickenesse and diseases, for hee was full of sores, and the dogges licking him were his best leeches, his pouertie could not purchase the helpe of any other (to cure him) in this world. And during this life

he was neuer raised vp from this fall, and yet God did not suffer him to fall foreuer. For at the last hee died, then ended all his miseries, then came glorious exaltation,Lu 16▪ 22 for he was carried by Angels into Abrahams bosome. Where, of his entertainement (farre differing from his late condition in this world) Abraham said to the rich man, Now is he comforted
                  25 
                  and thou art tormented. So that if GOD doe not raise the righteous from these miserable falles while they liue, yet hee will surely doe it after death: and if hee doe not exalt them, and set them vp on high in this world, yet he will surely lift them vp, and exalt them in the world to come, and place them together in the heauenly places, farre aboue the reach ofReuel. 21 all miserie (where there shall bee no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more paine) and where among the queeres of holy Angells, and in the middest of all true and eternall delights, they shall for euer reioyce and praise god. For of gods house, where the righteous departed shal haue their dwel ling places for euer, Dauid saith, In thy
                  Psal. 16. 11 
                  presence is the fulnes of ioy, and at thy right
                  
                  hand there are pleasures for euermore. Thus haue you heard how GOD will helpe the weary and laden, that cast their burden vpon him, he will nourish them that want, and raise vp them that are fallen.
