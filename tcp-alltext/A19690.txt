            To the tune of A, B, C.
            
               
            
            
               GOod fellowes all to you I send,
               These verses which in loue I pend:
               Desiring you will compasse keepe,
               and bid farwell good fellowship.
               
            
            
               I once did beare a good fellowes name,
               And still am counted for the same:
               But now my vow is ingaged deepe,
               to bid farwell good fellowship.

            The second part, wherein is declared, The backes complaint, hath the bellie reformed: To bid farwell good fellowship. To the same tune.
            
               
            
            
               THis sad complaint when I did heare
               Uewing my back, I see it was beare▪
               
               And cheifest cause I knew of it,
               was kéeping of good fellowship.
               
            
            
               Being much moued at the same,
               A solemne oath then did I frame:
               This hainious wrong, for to aquite,
               to bid farwell good fellowship.
               
            
            
               And therefore here I bid farwell,
               To that which once I lou'd to well:
               Henceforth I will in compasse keepe,
               therefore farwell good fellowship.
               
            
            
               Farwell all such as take delight,

               and fly out to good fellowship.
               
            
            
               Farwell good fellowes more and lesse,
               No tongue is able to expresse,
               The wofull wants that dayly hitte,
               on them that kéepe good fellowship.
               
            
            
               Some that were famous throw all parts,
               For workmanship and skill in Arts:
               Hath beggery cought vpon the hippe,
               for kéeping of good fellowship.
               
            
            
               So

                  e that haue had possessions store,
               Lands, goods, and cattell, few had more:
               But lands, & goods, oxe, horse, and sheepe,
               were wasted by good fellowship.
               
            
            
               Many examples are dayly séene.
               Of such that haue good fellowes beene,
               
                  Bacchus braue souldiers, stout and stiffe,
               which now lament good fellowship.
               
            
            
               And to conclud the sin is such,
               The wise man sayes, none shall be ritch
               Except he shun that bitter sweete,
               which drunkards call, good fellowship.
               
            
            
               Then learne this vice for to refraine,
               The onely cause of griefe and paine:
               Least yee like me in sorrow sit,
               lamenting of good fellowship.
