As Lucanus feyneth Athlaus had vii. doghters / vvyche had

hors vvyth mannes fleſſhe: vvher fore he vſed to ſlee hys geſtes for hys

¶The viii. labour ys of Achilaus. the fable ys thys. Hercules and
Achilaus vvreſſheled to gether for the mayden Dianer / & vvhen that
Achilaus feld hym ſelf at the vvorſe / he torned hym ſelf ſodenly in to

breke hys horne. & he for ſhame lepte in to the vvater & hyd hym.
                  The truthe of thys fable ys thys Achilaus ys a ryuer be tvvene grece

doghter Hercules raueſſhed. And comyng to thys ryuer vvhē he might
not paſſe hyt he ſtopped an arme of hyt & dryed hyt / & ſo he paſſed vvith

Hercules the myghty man coueyteth for to haue. Achilaus betokeneth
the ſenſualyte / vvych in youth hyley vvythſtandeth a man that vvold
be vertuous. But fyrſt the ſenſualyte as a ſerpent aſſayleth hym by many
ſyde vvayes / And vvhen thys myghty man hath ouercome al tho ſerpentes
deceytes / he torneth in to a bole vvyth ii. hornes / Lechory / &
Glotony. But thys one horne of Lechory / the vertuous man breketh
& vtterly deſtroyeth. & then ys the ſenſualyte ouercome / For the other
horne of glotony vvyl lyghtly of a vertuous man be put vnder by good
gouernaunce. So thys bole lepeth in to the ryuer. the ſenſualyte ys repreſſed
& keleth hym ſelf by penance / and ſo vvynneth the myghty man
vertue to hys loue.
                  ¶The ix. labour ys of Antheas the grete geaunt / vvych vvas geten

vvyth vvych geaunt Hercules vvraſteled / But alvvay vvhen he ſemed
dyſcomfeted / fallyng to ground he became as freſſhe as he vvas before
Than Hercules perceuyug thys toke hym in hys armes / & leyd hym on
hys breſt / and ſo ſtreyned hym to deth by ſtrengthe: & ſo caſte hym to
the grounde / & thus deſtroyed he the geaunt. By thes Antheus may
be vnderſtand vvordly couetyce / vvych encreſſeth & renueth hys strēgth
by tochyng of the groūd. For couetyce vvyl not be quenched by plenty
of vvordly good / but rather ys ther by renued & enforced. Hercules thē
the vertuous man / ſtreyneth thys couetyce vvythyn hys breſt / & vvyth
draeth hyt vtterly fro vvordly good / & ſo he quencheth the luſt that he
had ther on / & putteth hyt holely in vertu & in vvyſedom.
                  ¶The x. labour ys of Cakus the theffe of Libia vvych Hercules dyſcomfeted
& ſlvve. The fable ys thys. Ther vvas in the mounte
Aucentyne a monſtre / that ſpete fyre at hys mouthe / robbyng & deſpoylyng
the people of the contrey. And he vvas the ſonne of Vulcane / by
vvhom Euander kyng of the land vvas gretly a noyed. And Hercules

Invvard. And Hercules by eſtimation eſpyed vvhere they vvere / and
ſo droe Cakus out of hys denne / and ſloo hym. and ſo he eſed the kyng
deſtroyng hys enemy. ¶The moralyte ys thus. By thys Cakus
may be vnderſtand pryde. He ſpeteth fyre at hys mouthe / hye vvordes
of malyce and manace: He ys Vulcanus ſonne. For that vyce ys appropryat
to the deuel that fyrſt hyt founde. He vvaſteth and deuoreth and

                  ¶The xii. labour vvas thys: after the fable of Duyde. Athlas the
myghty geaunt / in the geauntes batayl / fyghtyng a genſt the goddes

he toke and bare hyt myghtely. vvherby he deſerued to be made a fayr
ſterre in heuen. The truthe vvas thys. Athlas vvas a cheffe aſtronomer

heuenly thynges. But vvhen Athlas dyed / vvych deth ys a reſt and

But a genſt thes inclinations / he may fyght beſt / that hathe

vvhos meuyng ys the ſvvyfteſt that ys poſſyble. The vvych lyne ys
deuyded in to CCC.lx. euen partes. Of vvyche partes / eueryche ys
called a degre. The meſure of a ryſyng of xv. degrees / ys called an
houre naturel. The meſure of a ryſyng of xxiiii. houres / ys a day naturel.
The meſure of CCC. lxv. dayes & vi. houres of encreſſe and
certen mynutes / ys called a yere. By vvych tymes: the perdurabelte
of thys vvorlde of before & after / ys meſured vſyngly. Syth than
that meſure of meuyng ys called tyme / then ſueth hyt: that before the
vvorlde meued / ther vvas no tyme: But god eternally ys / er any
thyng meued: or any tyme vvere / and ſhal be after that al meuynges
ceſſeth: For hys beyng ys meſured by no meuyng of before & after / for
hymſelf ys vnmeueable / ne hys beyng hath no regard to before & after
For al tymes preſent / paſſed / and to come: ben to hym verely preſent
Ne hys beyng ys not meſured by ſucceſſyon of tymes. For he hathe
hys beyng vnmeſured al at ones. vvyche ys called hys eternyte. Ther
fore ys god called Inmenſus. But the perdurabelte of the vvorlde
ys meſured by meuyng of the heuen / vvyche ys called tyme: And lenger
than heuen meueth / ſhal ther be no tyme. Than ys hyt ſo
that the beyng of god ys called erernyte. The beyng of thys vvorld
ys named perpetuyte. Then ys thys the conceyte of Plato ſayng that
the vvorlde hath euer ben / That ys to mene / as long as any thynge
hathe meued. And as long as any thyng meueth: or any tyme ys / 
ſo long hyt ſhal endure in ſuche beyng as hyt novv hathe. And after
that al meuyng and al tymes ceſſeth / the vvorlde renued ſhal endure in
lyffe interminable. For ſo ſayth our lorde. Ecce noua facio omnia.
                  ¶Thys interminable lyffe / ys the eternal beyng of our creatour▪ to
vvhō as to ther ende / al thyng ſhal be reduced: and at hym as at ther
fynal ende: reſt & abyde. Therfore ſayth plato as ys in the texte alleged / 
that the vvorlde hathe euer ben: that ys to ſay: ſyth any tyme
vvas. and hyt ſhal neuer vvhyle any tyme ys / ceſſen of hys menynge.
So meuyng & tyme ſhal ceſſen bothe at ones. And the vvorlde then
ſhal not ende by deſtruction or torne in to nought / for god and nature
dyd neuer thyng in vayn. Ne god noughteth neuer thyng that he made
but the corruption of one thyng / ys the generation of a nother thynge.
So that at laſt euery corruptyble thynge retorneth in rounde in to the
Elementes / that hyt vvas fyrſt formed of. And ther fore the autor ſayth
/ that the entent of temporel thynges that ſo meuethe in rounde / 
caſteth & entendeth by ledyng of nature / to counterfete the perdurable
lyffe of god. For kendly euery creature coueyteth: to conforme hym to
hys make / at leſt in beyng. vvher fore of nature euery thynge vvythſtandeth
in that hyt may / hys ovvne corruption & diuiſion of hys partes.
And vvhen hyt ys corrupt and reſolued in to hys fyrſt mater / 
vvyche ys the elementes / vvych ben cleped the ſedes of erthly thynges
then ben they apte as they vvere be fore to be mater and to clothe other
dyuers formes. And ſo ben they perpetuate / by ther chaungeabelte in

to an endles compate. For thes thynges yf they fayle in ther indiuidues
/ yet in ther vniuerſalles they a bydeth euer: after tyme that they
ones be. And the mater of the ſingulers / torneth into other thynges / 
after that nature vvorcheth. Than ys thys the conceyt of the
clerke in the letter. Euery creature as ys before ſayd / coueyteth of nature / 
for to counterfete hys maker. But for canſe thes erthly thynges
of febleneſſe and contraryouſtey of ther mater / may not endure / 
but nedes be reſolued / ther fore they take that they may of beyng / enduryng
by ſucceſſyon of tymes. vvhere that god endureth (not by temporal
ſucceſſyon) but hathe hys beyng ſeparate fro creatures al at ones
ſo that tovvardes hym nought ys to come / ne nought ouer paſſed / 
But al that ys / vvas / and ſhal be: ys be fore hym preſent.
                  Than hauyng regarde to the eternyte of god / vvyche hath hys beyng
al at ones vnmeſured by ſucceſſyon of tymes / ther ys no purueyaunce
ne foreſyght / but he ſeyth al by preſent knovvlege / & in hym / ys none
other ſyght but connyng. For al knovvyng of preſent and paſſed / noteth
imperfection of creatures that be paſſyng and corruptyble. And
hyt nedeth nought / ne ys conuenyent / to conforme hys eternal inſyght
to oure temporal eſtimation / that al thyng demeth by before and after
as vve haue ouer beynge. But hyt accordeth better / and ys more
kendly / that the creature ſubmytte al hys vvytte / and conforme al hys
knovvyng holly to hys maker / vvyth oute vvhom he ys nought / can
nought / ne hath nought at al / that ought ovveth to be cleped.
                  ¶Syth hyt ys ſo then that euery Iugement / muſt ſue the nature of
the Iuge / that ys of hym that knovveth / hyt nedeth not thē to bynden
thynges to falle neceſſaryly / ne to vvete the knovvyng of god for

as he al behaldeth / no more than for to vvyte me the meuyng of the
ſonne / by cauſe I ſe hyt meue / or for to vvyte me the deth of a man / 
by cauſe I ſe hym dye. For the meuyng of the ſonne ys cauſed abſolutely
of the fyrſt ordynaunce of hym that made hyt for to meue.
                  But that I novv ſe hyt meue / hyt procedeth of my ovvne fre vvylle /
