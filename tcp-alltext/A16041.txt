            ¶I aſke the banes betwix the hyghe and mooſt myghty prynce kyng of all kynges ſone of almyghty god and the virgyn Mary in humanyte Cryſte Ieſu of Nazareth of the one partye. And .A.B. of the thother partye / that yf ony man or woman can ſhewe ony lawfull Impedyment other by ony precontracte made or corrupcyon of body or ſoule of the ſayd .A.B. that ſhe ought not to be maryed this daye vnto the ſayd myghty prynce Ieſu that they wolde accordynge vnto the lawe ſhewe it.
            
               GOod ſyſter we are here gadred before almyghty god and all his ſayntes in heuen in his chirche here mylytaūt to ſolempne this noble ſpouſage bytwene the ſayd ſone of almyghty god and you / whiche ſpouſage muſt be of your partye deſyred with all your hole herte and free wyll / not compelled by none of your frendes / nor for cauſe of worldly worſhyp nor eaſe of your body / but oonly for the loue & ſeruyce ye owe to the ſayd myghty prynce / to ſerue hym & obeye hym & kepe his cōmaūdementes / and all other men & worldly worſhyp renounce and forſake

and hym to loue aboue all thynge / & his preceptes to performe and all other thynge to do that perteyneth to a good wyf. How moche be ye boūde vnto hym that wyll conſent that ye be maryed vnto hȳ ſo grete a prynce & almyghty / & ye a wretche his creature & of a poore lynage. For the cōmon vſage is kynges to mary togyder. Dukes and Erles togyder / and poore people togyder / and ſeldome ſeen the ryche and the poore mary togyder / and yet this mooſt myghty prynce lorde of heuen & of erthe for the loue he hereth vnto you to make you his quene his faer of heuen to be your fader his moder to be yours / & ſo by this maryage all your kynred ſhall be of coſynage by affynyte to the fad
                  
                     
                  
                  er
                of heuen / our lady all the angels with all the hole Genelogy of Cryſt / to whiche honour and excellence no carnall ſpouſage coude exalte you. Therfore yf ye contynue his faythfull & true ſpouſe cōmyttynge your mynde your wyll & all your werkes to obſerue his cōmaūdementes / your rewarde ſhall be as in your Ioynter & dowery excede all rewardes that can be thought and may be gyuen vnto man.
            FYrſt ſyſter yf ye wyll be ſpouſed to this noble prynce & ſo be determyned in your mynde. I ſaye thyſe wordes to you of the holy ghooſt. (Audi filia et vide & inclina aurem tuā et obliuiſcere populum tuū et domū patris tui) That is to

ſaye / doughter here ſee and gyue humble attendaūce / yf ye wyll be ſpouſed to this myghty prynce / ye muſt forgete and relynquyſſhe Ioye and felycyte of this worlde / and the houſe of all your generacyon / your fader and moder and all your carnall frendes / and ye muſte folowe hym in condycyons / and leue your olde name and condycyons and to be called after his name / his name is Ieſus Nazarenus. And ſoo ye muſte be called Nazarena. It is wryten (Nazarei candidores niue interpretantur virgulti vel floridi ſiue cuſtodientes aut ſeparati a mundo vel vncti ſiue ſancti aut conſecrati) That is to ſaye. Ye muſte be as a yonge grene braunche and as a floure and as a keper of the treſour of your huſbonde and ſeuered from the worlde as anoynted holy and conſecrate quene / for thyſe propertees amonge other hath your ſpouſe. Fyrſte ye muſte be as a yonge grene braunche / the whiche loſeth his fayre beaute whan he is ſeuered from the rote. The rote of all Relygyon is Ieſu of Nazareth that is charyte (Quia deus caritas eſt) And who ſo euer is not in charyte he departeth hymſelfe from almyghty god. Soo ye muſte loue your ſpouſe Ieſu aboue all thynge / he muſte be in your mynde / in your ſoule / in your herte / and in all your werkes. And of hym ſpecyally ye muſte ſpeke / for yf ye haue ony pleaſure for to ſpeke of ony other thynges of the worlde or of ony

other man / than wyll he be wrothe. For as Saynt Gregory ſayth (Prouidendū ergo nobis eſt quia intueri non debet quod nō licet concupiſci. Et iohannes) Cryſte ſayth (Qui ſtndet eligantes faci es inſpicere. ipſe fornacem paſſionis accendit) For he wyll that ye kepe oonly and entyerly vnto hym your fyue wyttes / to haue noo pleaſure for to loke vpon man or woman / nor to here of noo worldely thynges / nor ſpeke of noo concupyſcence / nor handell noo contagyous thynges / but oonly that ſhall be to his pleaſure and ſeruyce. For as ſaynt Ierom ſayth. There was neuer man ſoo Ielous of his wyf and taketh hede of his werkes and dedes as our lorde your ſpouſe wyll take hede of you For ye can thynke no thought but he knoweth it / nor ſpeke no worde but he hereth it / nor be in noo place but he is there preſente / nor noo thynge can dyſceyue hym / therfore ye muſte loue hym aboue all thynge and be in parfyte charyte with all your ſyſters and his people and ſeruauntes. Alſo Cryſt Ieſu is called (Flos campi) The floure of Nazareth / the beaute of this excedeth all other vertues & it is ſoo noble a treſour that it can not be prayſed / and therfore virgynyte is honoured in almyghty god. And Cryſte the heed and the leder therof and the fyrſte thynge that he dyde in erthe whan he became man he ſette vp his huſholde of virgyns & men of chaſtyte for to ſerue hym and

his chirche here in erthe / as he was by virgyns / the angels ſerued in heuen / his moder was and is perpetuall virgyne. Iohan Euangelyſte his ſecretary a virgyne. Iohan the Baptyſt a virgyne. Ieremy the prophete a virgyne / and angelles in heuen virgyns & Innumerable there ſyngynge and folowynge the lombe of god the ſeconde perſone / and neuer newe ſonges of Ioye and glorye. The angels of heuen honoureth virgyns as theyr brethern & ſyſtern. And as it is wryten (Apocal .xix.) The angell of god wolde not ſuffre ſaynt Iohan Euangelyſte to worſhyppe hym for loue he was a virgyne as he was and angell & man of the erthe And therfore Saynt Bernarde ſayth. What is more full of beaute than is chaſtyte (Quid caſtitate decorius. Que mundum de immundo conceptum ſemine de hoſte domeſticū de homine angelum facit) The angels worſhypped ſaynt Agnes and cladde her in a garment of chaſtyte / crowned ſaynt Cecylye / ſaynt Agas ſhewed her holyneſſe / ſaynt Katheryne buryed / & delyuered from deth Suſanne. And as it is wryten Numery .xxxi. (Omnes feminas virgines reſeruare alias ōnes iubentur interfici) That is to ſaye. That where all the people ſholde be deſtroyed and ſlayne for ſynne / yet god almyghty commaunded to ſpare virgyns. And therfor ſayth ſaynt Ancelme (Non eſt ſalus niſi quē tu virgo peperiſti) Saynt Margarete

hadde the deuyll vnder her feet and bounde hym / and he cryed & ſayd / leue ye yonge mayde ye deſtroye me. And in lyke wyſe Saynt Iulyan bette hym and put hym to grete rebuke / and therfore the deuyll worſhypped virgynyte as it is radde in Thobye the ſixte chapytre. For ryght as the deuyll hath power of all vnclene lyuers / ryght ſoo he honoureth virgyns and feereth theym bycauſe of the angelles. And therfore Saynt Iohan Cryſoſtomus ſayth (Caſtitas eſt res angelica ꝑ quam ſolum ſingulariter homines angelis aſſimulantur) And that angels haue in heuen by felycyte. A man or a woman beynge theyr in virgynyte haue by grace and by grete labour. Virgynyte by grace hath dyuerſe preuyleges. Fyrſte it replenyſſheth paradyſe (triceſimaſecunda queſtione prima ca. Nupcie) The ſeconde that virgynyte is a vertue that man only may pleaſe god with fayth (in aut. de leuo. s. Scimus colla .iij. the .iij.) It is the begynnynge of other vertues (In aut. quomō op. ep̄i. s. ne

Virgyns martyrs and there other / and hath (Aureolam triceſimaſecūda queſtione quinta. Si paulus) For as matrymony replenyſſhed the erthe with children / ryght ſo a virgyne replenyſſhed paradyſe (triceſimaſecūda queſtione .i. Nupcie) Moders of children of the worlde

hath grete beſynes and ſorowe for to brynge forth theyr children / a virgyn is in quyetneſſe and bryngeth forth her children in grete Ioye as it is wryten (Mathei .xxij. Que parate erant intrauerunt cum eo ad nupcias) And as it is wryten (Cantico
                  
                     
                  
                  rum
                ſecundo. Sicut lilium inter ſpinas ſic amica mea inter filias) Virgynyte is lykened vnto a lyly the leuys of the lyly that conſerued the beaute therof is ſobreneſſe of mete and drynke / the contrarye therof is ſhewed in Loth beynge dronken fyled his owne doughters (Geneſis decimonono .xv.q.i. Inebriauerunt) Ieronimus (Uirgo vinum fugiat pro veneno) As who ſayth / a virgyn ſholde hate wyne as venym.
            
               ¶Cuſtos.
               ALſo ye muſt be a cuſtos / a keper of all ſuche thynges as this daye ſhall be delyuered vnto you in the name of your ſpouſe & folowe hȳ therin. For and ye kepe not all thynges in theyr beynge as he hath made theym / they ſholde forthwith be deſtroyed / and therof Dauyd ſayth (Niſi dominus cuſtodierit ciuitatem &c̄.) So ye muſt kepe the treſour of your ſpouſe Cryſte perteynynge to his fayth & to haue in your remembraūce & wyll to kepe the foure thynges that ſhall be delyuerd vnto you this daye / your veyle & your mantell both beynge of blake & a rynge wt a lyght of waxe berynge in your honde / and in kepynge of thyſe it

ſhalbe ſhewed as ye loue your huſbonde. This veyle and mantell remembred ryght well the virgyn ſaynt Agnes whan ſhe ſayd (Poſuit ſignū in faciem meā et nullū amatorē preter eum admittā) That is to ſaye. He hath couerd my ſoule Inwarde and myn heed with a veyle / that and yf I wyll loue ony man better than hym I ſhall goo to the colour of my veyle and that is euerlaſtynge deth. In lyke wyſe ſhe ſhewed that her ſpouſe Cryſte Ieſu had Indued her wt a garment all ſette with precyous ſtones / that is to ſaye / with charyte / fayth hope / humylyte / obedyens / abſtynence / & prayer / & Inbroudred all thyſe fayr vertues in the blake garmente of her body and ſoule here knytte togyder / whiche may euery vertuous perſone dayly vſe and encreaſe to his rewarde by grace and free wyl that be gyuen vnto hym yf he wyll ſeke therfore. And therfore the ſayd ſaynt Agnes ſonge & ſayd to all virgynes (Induit me dn̄s ciclade auro detexta) (Anulū) Alſo I haue by the auctoryte gyuen vnto me by Cryſt Ieſu to delyuer vnto you this daye a rynge in token of maryage Indyſſolyble to be made betwix you & hym. For as ſaynt Poule ſayth Ye muſt herafter remembre no thynge but that is godly / & therfore the ſayd ſaynt Agnes cryed with a grete voyce agaynſt the deuyll & hym that tempted her to vnclenly deſyres ſayenge (Diſcite a me pabulum mortis. quia ab aliū amatore preuenta ſum)

And ſhewed vnto hym and vnto all the people with a mery voyce (Anulo ſuo ſubornauit me dominus noſter Ieſus criſtus et tan

All the pleaſures and temptacyōs of the worlde departe from me / for our lorde Ieſu Cryſte with his rynge hath wedde me and hath crowned me with a crowne of euerlaſtynge Ioye yf I kepe truly my loue & ſpouſage vnto hym.
            
            
               ¶Lumen.
               ALſo remembre the lyght yt ye brynge with you / that ſygnefyeth Cryſte Ieſu. That is (Uera lux que illuminat omnem hominē venien tem in hunc mundum) Whos fayth by his chirche taught you ye muſt entyerly kepe & ſee your lyght go not out but be brennynge in your ſoule and in your mynde by the bleſſyd Incarnacōn / paſſyon / reſurreccyon / and the mooſt bleſſyd lyf of our ſauyour Cryſte Ieſu / and that ye falle in none erthely ſynne / hereſye nor errours by ony mānes techynge nor dyſpute not the rules of your relygyon / but wt all reuerence and obedyence that ye may do ye take theym / obeye theym / & obſerue them. And whatſoeuer your abbeſſe or the rewlers of your relygyon commaunde you to do / byleue it is for the helth of your ſoule and accordynge to your relygyon / and honour and loue theym as your fader and moder ye muſte be pacyent amonge your ſyſters & ſuffre

               ¶Nazarena.
               ALſo ye muſt be Nazarena / that is to ſaye / deſeuered from the worlde / as Ieſus Nazarenus ſayth hymſelf (Regnū meū non eſt in hoc mūdo) But though your body be here in this worlde corporally / your mynde & your ſoule to be with Cryſte Ieſu / and ſo take the worlde in all thynge therin and ſaye with Saynt Poule. The worlde is to me a payne / and I to the worlde / my Ioye is oonly in Cryſte crucefyed. So ſyſter your pleaſure and conuerſacyon muſte oonly be in the croſſe of Cryſte / that is penaunce / in faſtynge / prayer / and mortyfycacyon of your enemy the fleſſhe and let it not haue his wyll / kepe you within your monaſterye and departe not therfro (.xvi.q.i. placuit. n.) For ryght as a fyſſhe deyeth that is without water Ryght ſoo a man or woman of Relygyon beynge

without theyr cloyſter is deed in theyr ſoules. Remembre the ſtory of the bybell that Dena Iacobs doughter ſhe wolde not kepe her within / not cloſe as ſhe was cōmaunded / but wolde go forth amonge yonge people and ſoo was corrupte and rauyſſhed / and therof folowed Infenyte manſlaughter & murdre. Moyſes beynge in monte of Relygyon he ſpake with god / without he ſpake but with man (.xxxvi.di.c. Si) A woman of Relygyon or a man beynge in theyr cloyſter in prayer they ſpeke with god / without they ſpeke with the deuyll / & therfor an holy fader ſayd / ryght as an henne yt hath egges leueth her egges ſhall of them neuer come chekens So ſhall none be good Relygyous man or woman that leueth the place of Relygyon. And as it is rad in (Vitis patrū) Ther was a monke by longe ſpace tempted by the deuyll & he reſyſted hym ſore / at the laſt he brought the monke to the dore where he ſholde departe from the place of Relygyon / he made there a croſſe and cryed to the deuyll / thou haſt pulled me hyder / pulle me now ferder & thou canſt but it ſhall neuer lye in thy power.
