               THE LORDS OF HIS MAIESTIES most honorable privey Counſell.
            I have ſet forth (Right Honorable) ſundry bookes, inſtitutions for Iewes in our Chriſtianity. Two, of Epiſtles, printed afore A. D. 1599. and the one in ſeaven languages. The other Arch. VVh. cauſed to be tranſlated. The matter of them I need not to tell. An other work is but part Ebrew: in a commentary vpon Eccleſiaſtes: & that is tranſlated ſo much as in Engliſh might be. An other

is joyned in argument: that Salomons family ended in the Kinges: and thence Nathans was afflicted: even unto the afflicting of our Lord: and of Chriſtians 300 yeares. That, I have tranſlated into Greeke: and into Latin for Europe. And I think that no Romiſt, or Law of England wil blame any poſition of it. An other is altogeather againſt the Iewes, for diſturbing the holy ſtory wilfully; that the redēption tyme ſhould not appeare. That work neded not to be tranſlated for England: becauſe I opened every poſition of it to England afore. All theſe bookes I made for the honor of the King: that all Iewes and Gentiles bettered by them, ſhould pray for the King and the Kinges children. And them I commend to your Lordſhipes care, to be regarded according to the ſage honour of his Majeſties governement.
            
               Your Lordſhips moſt humble:
Hugh Broughton.
