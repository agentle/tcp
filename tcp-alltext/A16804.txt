               GEntlemen, or others, who imploy your time in the studies of such Arts, as are the Ornaments of Gentility, to your courtesies I commēd the vnlearned discourse of my little wit, which as I will not intreate you to commend, deseruing the contrarie: so I hope you will not disdaine, though it deserue discommendation, but so by your pardons, excuse my small discretiō by great desire, that here

            The Epistle to the gentle Reader.
            
               A New Booke saies one, true, it came forth but tother day, good stuffe saies an other. Read, then iudge. I confesseit may seeme to a number, a bolde attempt, to set out a forme of wit, considering the witty discourses, of such fine wits as haue deserued such cōmēdation, as may driue this meane peece of woorke of mine into vtter disgrace, were it not that perfect courtesie dooth beare with imperfect knowledge, regarding more the good minde in the writer, then the matter written, and therefore the best will giue good woords, whatsoeuer they think, to incourage a forward will to doo better, when indeede it were a fantasticall heade that coulde doo worse. VVell when VVit is a wool-gathering, and VVill wandring, the worlde without guide, what a case that manne is in, that is in such a taking I referre you to madde folkes, of whome you maye see examples sufficient, and so I beeing in a certaine melancholye moode, past all Gods forbod, tooke my Pen and Inke and paper, and somewhat I would goe doo, whatsoeuer it were, to put out one conceit, and bring in an other, at last, and at first, of a suddaine, vnwares, and at aduentures, by Gods

good helpe, and good fortune, the litle wit that I had, meeting with good Will, I knew not how, fell to worke, (at first) I know not what, but hauing written a while, I made somewhat of it, which though litle to any great purpose, yet, if it please the readers, I am contented, & if any man thinke it well done, then Wit shall thinke Will a good boy, and Will shall thinke he tooke Wit in a good vaine, and Will and Wit shall haue the more heart heereafter, to fall to further woorke, but if I haue bin more wilfull then wise, to trouble your wi

               VVHat thing is Will, without good Wit?
               
               Or what is Wit, without good Will?
               
               The one the other doth so fit:
               As each alone can be but ill.
               But when they once be well agreede:
               Their worke is likely well to speede.
            
            
               For proofe behold good Bretons will,
               By helpe of Wit, what it hath writ:
               A worke not of the 
                     •…
                  eanest skill,
               Nor such as shewes a simple Wit.
               
               But such a Wit, and such a Will:
               
               As hath done well and hateth ill.
            
            
               I neede not to commend the man,
               VVhom none can iustly discommend:
               But doo the best, the best that can,
               Yet some will spite, and so I ende.
               VVhat I haue said, I say so still,
               I must commend, this VVit and VVill.

               Or praise the man, with praises manifolde,
               When of himselfe him selfe is vertuous,
               
                  Wit is but VVit, yet such his Wit and Will,

               Why? what his Will? reade on, and learne of Wit:
               Both good I gesse, yet each a seuerall ill,
               This may seeme straunge, to those that heare of it.
               Nay, neere a whit, for vertue many waies,
               Is made a vice, yet Vertue hath her praise.

               A bolde attempt it is to set them forth.
               A forme of Wit, and that in such a sort,
               As none offends, for all is said in sport.

               With some extreames, their patient mindes to proue.

                  LOng haue I trauailed, much grounde haue I gone, many wayes haue I trode, mickle money haue I spent, more labor haue I lost, in seeking an old friend of mine: whose cōpanie so courteous, his counsaile commodious his presence so pleasant, and his absence so graeuous, that when I thinke of him, and misse him, I find such a misse of him, as all things are out of frame with mée. And out of frame, can come to no good fashion. Oh what shall I doo? It is long since I lost him: long haue I sought him. And too long (I feare) it will be ere I finde him? But wot you who it is? Oh my wit, I am from my Wit, and haue beene long. Alas the day. I haue bin almost madde, with marching through the world, without my good guide, my freende, and Companion, my Brother, yea, my selfe. Alas, where is hee? When shall I sée him? How shall I séeke him, and whither shall I walke? I was too soone wearie of him, and am now weary of my selfe without him. Well, I will goe where I may, I may hap to finde him: but hap is vnhappie. Therefore hap good, or happe ill, I will walke on still: if I finde him, happy man. If I doo not, what than? Content my selfe euen as I can, Patience where is no remedy.

               Long haue I lookt, far haue I sought, oft haue I wisht, and sore haue I longed for my merry mate, my quicke sprite, my dearling, and my dearest byrde: Whose courtesie so contentiue, whose helpe so necessary, whose necessitie

so great, whose presence so pleased mee, and absence so angers mee: that when I would haue him, and see, I am without him: I am not in order, and being out of order, can take no good course. Alas what shall be

Many a walke haue I fet, but no comfort could I get, till now by thee mine onely friend, with whome I meane my life to ende.

               Then harke good wit vnto my tale: not of amidde my blisse in bale, nor any such like stuffe so stale. I studie not to talke in verse, but I will vnto thee rehearse, a plaine discourse, in homely prosse, wherein I will at large disclose: How I

Beleeue mee sweete wit, there is such falling out with Fancie, who shiftes all vpon Folly. Such exclamation vpon Folly, who bringes them to Fortune: such cursing and banning of Fortune, for her froward dealing: in gentle helping them vppe vppon the wheele, and then suddaine dinging them downe (almost to theyr destruction,) that if there bee a Hell in this worlde, there is the place.

                           Oh brother, I will tell you how: you knowe, sometime trauailers must néedes haue rest, which they must come by, as they may: Now I hauing walked, (as I tolde you) through this vnpleasant place: weary at last, I layde me downe in the ditch of Distresse, where, finding many dead skulles, and other boanes, I there thought to beginne a sléepe, or sleepe my last: now lying there, in such sorte as I tell you, mée thought in my sléepe I sighed, in which sorrow, a good motion of minde, set my heart to prayer: which tended to this effect, that it would please, the mightie and mercifull Maiestie, of the most highest, to sende me some meane, to leade me out of this miserie: beeing as it were from my Wit, and altogither comfortlesse. Now suddainly there appeared vnto me, an olde aged man, who tooke me by the hand, with these words: Arise thou sluggish wanton, walke no longer out of thy way: turne thee backe from this straye pathe, experience doth teach thée: what is VVill without VVit? Prayer hath procured thee pardon, the high and onely God hath giuen thée Grace, by Grace goe seeke, that is worth the finding: looke where VVit is too him, and make much of him: With ioye of that worde, I awaked, and with shame of my Folly in leauing thee, I hung the head: with sorrowe whereof, I was almost of life depriued: but now by thy sweete welcome, wholy reuiued: now awake (I shoulde say) I sawe none but thee: and now while I liue, I will followe thée.

But to quit thy tale, I will tell thée a little of my trauaile, and so we will away togither.

In Latine I remember these: Quid tam difficile quod non solertia vincit? By that was written, Labore vertus: And by that, vertute Fama: And ouer that, Fama immortalis: And that was written, in many places about the house. In Italian was written, Giouentù vecchezza: by that, vecchezza Morte, et Morte Tempo, et tempo Fama: but ouer all, sopra tutti, triumpha Idd

was writtē. Patience is a vertue. Vertue is Famous. Fame is diuine. Diuinitie is gratious. Grace is the gift of God: And God is the onely giuer of grace. Which by Patiēce seekes the vertue y• is Famous to the diuine pleasure of the giuer of all good gifts: Blessed be his name, this shal he find, that enters Fort of Fame.

                           Then will I tel thée further, as I walked vp & down with Fauour, I heard Courtesie & Content, (a couple of Courtiers) discoursing of thée and mée. Of the Uertues of wit, and the vanities of will.
                           
                           
                              Wit, they sayde, was desirous of knowledge, but Will could take no paine: wit would haue Patience, but will would be wood with anger: wit would worke, when wil would stand ydle: wit would bee walking, when will woulde bee slouthfull: wit woulde call for willes helpe, when will cared not for wits counsaile: wit woulde bee wise, and wil would be wanton: wit would be Uertuous, and wil vaine: vvit would be Famous, and vvil foolish: vvit would be sober, and vvil frantick: vvit would be carefull, and vvill carelesse: wit studying, and will playing: vit at good exercise, and wil idle, and worse occupied: wit mourning for wil, wil making no mone for wit: VVit in his dumps, and wil in delights: wit would doo well, and haue wil doo no worse, if he would followe him. But wil would loose wit, and wit must worke without wil and against wil: and yet this is straunge, they were sworne Brethren, one could not be without the other. Yet wit could make better shift alone: wit could finde wil, when he had lost himselfe, and wil (yet) would please wit well, when hee would bee a good boye: Which he would neuer be, till he were beaten, and y• with the smart of his owne rod: then he would come home to wit, follow wit as his best freend, and neuer leaue him to the last houre.
                           Nowe when I heard this discourse, I remembred thée, and béeing able to tarie no longer, the hearing of such matter, against him whom I loue, I entreated Fauour to

bring mée forth into the Court, towardes the Countinghouse: whither walking, I stumbled by the way, and fell as I tolde you: wherewith I awooke. Now good wil since I haue found thee, and nowe thou seest the miseries of the worlde: come, followe me, let me bring thée to a better course: Let not mée mourne for thée, nor other thus talke of thée: I will make much of thée, if thou wilt loue mée: I will make thée giue them cause to say: see what a chaunge? wil is come home wit is content to bee ruled by wit: hee workes with wit, hee walkes with wit: he mournes and is merie with wit: he is trauailing to vertue with wit, he wil finde Fame by wit: why hee, wil? he is as welcome as wit, as worthie as wit, now hee hath learned of wit, howe to direct his course: beleeue me wil, I loue thée.

                           Gramercie. But shall I now tell thee, a little that I had forgotten, that I sawe and hearde in the Lake of Miserie?
                        
                        
                           Wit.
                           Contented good wil, and gramercie too.
                        
                        
                           Wil.
                           Then wit thou shalt vnderstand, I heard these spéeches past among Penitent people: when wit is wayward, Wil is no body: wofull wit, blames wanton wil: wanton Wit, chides worthy vvil: vnhappy vvit, hasty wil: fātastical VVit, forward vvil. Ouer that, vvit thinks scorne of vvil, but yet he cannot bee without him: VVit hath lost vvil, but yet he is glad to séeke him: VVit mournes for Wil, but Wit sees it not: Will trauailes for the Stone, that VVit must whet himselfe vppon: VVil is painefull, but vvit vnthankfull: vvil is courteous, but vvit curst:

                              Will soone content, wit too curious: will would bee ruled, but wit had no reason: wil would haue béene Famous, had wit béene Uertuous: wil had béene good, had not wit beene bad: wil had not lost wit, had wit lookt vnto him: Wil would doo well, if wit woulde doo better: wil woulde learne, if wit woulde teache him: But wil must worke without wit, and against wit: and yet it was woonderfull that sworne Brethren shoulde so disagrée, yet one so necessarie for the other in all actions, as nothing could hitte well, when they were a sunder. Wil coulde méete wit in a Maze, and comfort him with his company: wil could bring wit into a good order, when hée was quite out of course. Wit would be glad of wil: but when? when he found the want of his Fréende, which he would neuer doo, till he were wearie of working alone: and then he would embrace wil, make much of wil, and neuer leaue wil for any worlds good. Now when I heard so much of my good Wit, I could not tarie any longer in the company, but frō them I go, and by my selfe sate downe, where I slept, and wakte, as I told you.
                        
                        
                           VVit.
                           Gramarcie good will: Why then I perceiue, we were both a sléepe, we lost one an other in trauaile, and trauailed in sléepe, to seeke one another: which walking we haue found: happy bee this day of our méeting, and twise happy houre of this our freendly gréeting: Hee runs farre, that neuer turnes: hee turnes well, that stayes in time: and hée stayes well, that stands fast: he stands fast, that neuer falles: hée falles lowe, that neuer riseth: hee riseth well, that stands alone when he is vp. Good VVill, well met, lette vs nowe bee merrie, shake hands, sweare company, and neuer part.

                           Care is the King of Kings, vvhen all is done.
                        
                        FINIS.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               VVIll.
               Surely, I neuer heard so much of Care, before: but reason hath shewed me, all is true that you haue spoken of him. And therefore let vs humbly craue his helpe in this our worke, which wee are to take in hand, I dare warrant his fauour. VVit, Saist theu so VVill? then let vs goe: Time trudgeth away, we haue talked long: Mountaines neuer meete, but freendes often: good happe comes oft vnlookt for, but neuer vnwelcome. I thought not to haue found thée heere, but we see Fortune doth much, but Fates more to bring fréendes togither: and friendship doth much, where faith is fixed: And faith is a Iewell, and Iewelles are precious, and precious is for Princes.
               Oh God, trust me wil, we must be warie to work so with aduise of Care, that as we are friends one to another, so we may prooue in all actions to shew our chéefest Iewell, our faithfull heart to God and her Maiestie: To whom might we once be so happie, as to present a péece of work worthie the receit: oh how glad should then eur hearts bee, which with faithful dutie would aduenture death for her most excellent fauour: which til by desert we finde, & alwaies let vs loue and honour our singuler good Lord, that hath vouchsafed vs his vndeserued fauour: and let vs heartily praye for the preseruation of her most excellent Maiestie, with

long and prosperous reigne ouer vs: as for the aduancement of his Honours estate: who by his Uertues deserues, and by desertes hath found Fauour of her Highnes, loue of her Péeres, honour of vs, and a number our betters. And so let vs away into my Closset of Conceit, where from company we will thinke vpon such matters, as heere we

               Content. Wee wll goe togither, studie thou, and I will make my pen, ready at thine, or his Honours commandement. And thus, til we haue dispatcht our worke in hand: lette vs take our leaue, humbly of our good Lord, and courteously of all our fréendes: Wishing them to imploy their studies, to the pleasure of God, contēt of the best sort, profit of themselues, and good example to others: and so Bacciando le mani del Signore, let vs bid them all Adio. From our heart, this, 20. of August. 1597.

Now there were two Ladies, that sate in such a state, that I had much a doo, to looke vp to them, these were Vertue and Fame: Nowe belowe there were two Sprites, which I was vily afraide off, the one was pide of all colours, and the other as blacke as a Coale: the coloured was Vanitie, and the other Infamie.

I like it well, that thou wilt rather seeke to recouer thine olde fréendes, then to runne after newe. Kéepe still with Care, and wisdome will so perswade thy wit with Reason, that thou shalt finde mee alwaies at an inch with thée. Marry, as wit is

ruled by Reason, Reason by wisdome, Wisdome kept by Care, and Care hath onely Content at commaundement: so must thou, now thou hast founde vs out, vse vs in our kinde, which if thou art desirous to learne, thou must intreate with wit, by Reason, to demaunde of wisdome: of whome thou shalt knowe more then I can tell thée, and so welcome, I haue no more to say vnto thee. I glad of this their fréendly greeting, went first to VVit: My good Wit (quoth I) thou knowest how long I haue longed for Content: how long I haue sought him, and could neuer finde him: and now hauing found him, I am to craue thy counsaile how to vse him.
            Alas (quoth will) I am heartily gladde of thy good minde: rome, wee will to Reason, for without him, I am nobody. Reason presently perswaded with mee, that it was his dutie, to demaunde Counsaile of wisedome. Nowe when wée came to wisdome, hée saide hée woulde talke a little with Care, and giue mee aunswere.

to allure vs. Vanitie, had a Million of toyes, which so pleased mine eye, that Wit and Reason had much a doo, to holde me from her: shee would shewe mee such gallant inchaunted Glasses, and in them such swete Ladies, such heauenly Faces, & such singular bodies, with such excellent Graces, that if I had had Fancie with mee, shee had beene fast for starting: if Loue, he had beene linckt: if Frenzie, he had beene in his kinde: if Patience, shee would haue forgot her selfe.

            Now when Beautie could doo nothing, then did shee fill out dilicate Wines, into Artificicall Glasses, and sette daintie Iunkettes, to mooue me to that vaine delight.

feare looke away from Loue, with loyaltie to Vertue, frowne on Fancie, with Fidelitie to Fame: Make much of wit, and loue Reason, honour wisedome, by carefull wisdome seeke wealth sufficient: let wealth not make th

               t your returne, I promise you preferment to Fame, and thus fare you well.
            Thus backe againe went I, through all the perillous passages, y• I had gone through before. Now first I must passe by the two Spirits, which as I came by, the pie
                  •…
                Spirit, first began thus to play the Trull with mee, shee helde mee out a Glasse, wherein shee did liuelie showe me such intising toyes, as woulde haue made a man that had any life in him, to haue lookt towards them.
            First, shee shewed mee a trowpe of faire Ladies, euerie one her Louer, colling and kissing, chinning and embracing, and looking Badies in one anothers eyes: Anon they were set downe, euerie Ladie with her Louer hard by her, with his head in her lay, and his hand in her purse. By them a sight of sweete Soules, sitting by a Candle, catching of Fleas.
            There were other sights of more effect then all these, to set a yong mans heart on fire: but let them all go, when I wisht my selfe a Louer: what? quoth Reason) Loue hath no Reason, wouldst thou lo

            Now when Vanitie sawe shee could doo nothing with me this way, she beganne to to vse Uillanie with me, come slaue (quoth shee) doost thou thinke scorne to looke towards her, whome Princes doo so dearely account of? thou

               lauerie, prate to Patches: when thou findest a foole for thy diet, feede him with a dish of Diddledomes, for I haue done with thee: if euer I serued thee, I am sorie for it: and since my wages was but lost, I meane to liue no longer by it. As will brought mee to thee, so hath wit by Reason brought me from you both.
            At these words her Cake was dowe, shée hung the head, her Trumpetter sounded, Toutest Moote: thus I past the first perrill. Nowe must I come by Patience, who sate with Discontent, whome I onelie smiled on, as I went by, to see her simplicitie: Promise (quoth shee) let mee haue my Content: Tell her (quoth wit) Reason sayes, enemies are too néere: send away Discontent, and as wisdome allowes of it, you shall heare more of him: Till then, perforce Patience be still, and so Adieu: Shee aunswered nothing, but putting finger in the eye, let mee passe.
            Then came I by Frenzie, whose madde countenance so amazed me, as that nowe it was no boo
                  •…
               e, to bidde me leape lightly, till I were beyonde him: For wit tolde mee before, that Frenzie was an enemie to Reason. Then escaping his clutches, I must come by Loue: newe began I to looke away, as it were ouer the shoulder, towardes my Mystresse, who had commaunded mee to take héede of looking towardes Loue. Yet did I heare him vtter these speeches: is VVit and Reason not sufficient to deale with Loue? Why? Art thou afrayed to looke? Why Cupid will not strike thee blinde: Tush (quoth VVit) tell him, Reason sayes, Loue is too lo
                  •…
               tie for Reason to rule: and VVit too weake when Reason must yeeld. I would bee loath to venter mine eye sight. At this answer, Loue
               
with Rage kept such a reakes, that I thought they would haue gone mad togither. Well, thus leauing them not farre from Frenzie, I must passe by Fancie: whome I frowned on so, that shee had little minde to flatter mee, and therefore bluntlie shee askt mee: what? friend are you angrie with me? and wherefore? For that (quoth I) thou art a blocke in my way to Fame: I would (quoth shee) Fancie were no bodie. Yes (quoth Wit) tell her, Reason dooth admit her one with Loue, but not with Wisedome, and so bid her farewell. Thus thanked be God, I had well euergone t
                  •…
               is companie, and with Wit and Reason, I brought my Content to Wisdome. To whome, when I had deliuered my message from Vertue: Well (quoth he) nowe shalt thou once passe backe againe, through this companie, and then thou shalt haue entertainment of thy desired Lady. My selfe will so accompanie thee, that though great will bee thy daunger, yet little shall bee thy harme, and easie thy passage.
            Nowe thou hast passed hitherto, with Wit and Reason, I will this giue thee to vnderstande, that I haue a friende and a seruaunt, both of one name: My friend is Reason, and so do I call my seruant: my friend is Reason, giuen mee by diuine Grace, who helpes mee to see howe high the power of God is, aboue the greatest Potentate vpon the earth: Howe much naturall Reason is subiest to diuine Iudgement, by the dutie that Nature dooth owe vnto her Creator.
            Nowe as thou goest by Fancie, perhappes she will get helpe by naturall Reason, to bring her to thy bowe: But I will bée by thée, to keepe thee from her bent. So will Loue vse Reason, to bring thee to his Lure, but let mee alone to kéepe thée from his lewdnesse: Frenzie there is no talking with, let vs flie him speedilie. Patience will perswade thee with Reason, but I will pleade with her so for thée, that thou shalt passe her well enough:
            
               Now if Vanitie gette Reason, wee shall doo ill enough with her: yet will I finde her Uaine so, as that if I lette her blood, I will strike her heart so deade, as that shee shall haue no stomacke, to striue longer with vs: nor Infamie for sorrowe, haue power to sounde his Trumpet.
            And therefore now reioyce, that though thou hast long runne astray, yet that now at last, thou has

                hit on a happie way: well time trudgeth away, thou wouldest fain begon, and I would as faine preferre my seruants, therefore let vs be going.
            Now, anone we came to Fancie, who had gotten wit and Reason: and as soone as shée had espied me, Freende (quoth shée) welcome, better late then neuer. N

Yes (quoth I) so Wisdome will mee. Why, (quoth Reason) am not I seruant to VVisdome? Yes, (quoth I) so is VVisedome thy Maister. And (quoth he) hath not my Maister sent mee hither to tell thee, that there is no man but must yeelde to his Fancie? Tell him (quoth VVisdome) where Grace doth gouerne, Fancie must obeye. Yea, but (quoth Reason) Nature followes Fancie. Yea, but tell him quoth Wisdome) diuin

What? (quoth Loue) wilt thou not bee ruled by Reason? Yes (quoth I) so he bee not ruled by Nature. Why (quoth he) wilt thou not allowe Reason to yéelde to Nature? yes (quoth I) Naturall Reason: and (quoth hee) wilt thou take Reason for no bodie? yes (quoth I) when I am without wisedome: and when you are with him, what doo you thinke him? aline to leade a foole to Loue, and a i

With both (quoth I) but with thee neuer so much, as when thou wouldest bring mee in liking with Loue: therefore leaue thy illusions, for I like neither them, thee, nor thy Loue, farewell. Nowe was hee skipt from Frenzie, and got to Patience, with whome (when we had escaped) Frenzie, wee found sitting togither. Nowe (quoth Patience) at last I trust (though long first) we shall bee friends. Come let vs liue togither: Soft (quoth I) no haste but good. I remember an Italian Prouerbe:

Why (quoth hee) dooth not Reason affirme Patience a remedie in all perplexities? a remedie (quoth I?) no: shee is a rest betwixt Rage and Reason, in a Discontented minde: Why (quoth hee) is shee not a Vertue? Not (quoth I) as thou canst consider her.
            Why (quoth he) dooth she not set the Discontented minde at quiet? No (quoth I) but shee makes the minde that would ease the bodie, with outward

Thus Wisdome déemes her a Uertue, that waites on Uillaines, and such a Uertue, as the vertuous minde doth not loue to trouble it selfe with all. Adieu▪ I haue no more to say to thée, nor will I haue to doo with thée. Well, now was our first passage past ouer: Nowe must we passe by Vanitie: there was a peece of worke. Now forsooth beganne Vanitie to reach out her hande: Fréend (quoth shée) welcome, I thought I had lest thée: Soft (quoth I) hande off, triumph not before the victorie. Why? (quoth shée) shall not Reason stay thée: No (quoth Wisdome) tell her, not when I sée him so neere Vanitie. Why (quoth Reason) is not the beautie of Ladies, the brauerie of Apparell, the swéete sounde of Musicke, the pleasaunt taste of Win

               ate I thinke: No (quoth I) I see a sentence ouer your heades, sufficient to set mee farre enough from you. What is it (quoth Reason?) Oh (quoth I) Vanitas vanitum, & omnia vanitas. Nowe (quoth hee) I haue no more to saye: I sée my Maister is too neere thée: Vanitie, farewell, I must away with my Maister. So away went we by Infamie, who was readie to wéepe for sorrowe, to see that now his Ladie had gotten neere a seruaunt, nor he néere a companion to make him so merrie, as to sound his Trumpette.

               GEntle Reader, reade no further then you like, if you finde any thing to your Content: thinke well of mee for my paines. If there be nothing that likes you, my lucke is nought: in nothing there can be no great thing, yet something may bee founde, though nothing to any great purpose. Well, there are diuers Nothings, which you shall reade further off, if you will take paines to turne ouer the leafe, and peruse the rest that followes. Now, though I will wish you looke for no meruailous, or worthy thing, yet shall you finde something, though in effect (as it were) nothing, yet in conceit a pretie thing to passe away the time withal. Wel, if you stande content with this Nothing, it may bee ere long, I will send you something, more to your liking: till when, I wish you nothing but well. And so I bid you fare well, from my Chamber at the blacke Friers.

Knowledge (I sée) is hardly come by▪ and hardnesse is vnpleasaunt to the heart: when the heart is ill, all the body is the worse: she body not well, howe can the minde be at quiet? And the minde disturbed, what case is man in? Ah moulde of mishappe, framed to so many miseries: Oh cursed Fortune, that bringest out of frame, a thing so blessedly framed.

For Beauty is but a secret allurement of the eye, to liking of the person where it is placed. Now that lyking growto Loue, of

the person Beautifull: which but for Beautie (some time) were more worthie hate, then, in this it falles out to bee an illusion, a deceit of Conceit by allurement of the cie. But whereof growes this? but of the fault of Conceit: which I shewed before, is (though some thing) nothing.

It is subiect to manie casualties: and in that it is so vncertaine a thing, it is nothing certaine, not certainly nothing, but nothing durable, then in this it is nothing, though otherwayes something: but enough of this Nothing, and now to some other, which seemeth something, but in

                  Honour: That is a thing greatly sought, little sounde, and much made account of, nor for the Uertue of the substaunce it carrieth with it: but for the Maiestie of the matter, which in substaunce is nothing, it purchaseth to the person Honourable reuerence of his Inferiours, familiaritie with the Nobilitie, and fauour of the Soueraigntie. Nowe there are diuerse Honours, one Honour is gotten by Riches, which is a thing nothing durable: of nothing growes nothing, then Riches decaied, dies the Honour, then that Honour is nothing, in that it is as Riches nothing durable.
               An other Honour is gotte by valiancie, and that is in Warre, whereby the Captaine winneth the Armes, that after during life, he, to his honour, and after him his po

               But leauing this, there is now another Honour, got by Learning, which gaineth the knowledge of many things,

and the vse of the same. The best things it sheweth, and descries the woorst: it teacheth to know God, and how to serue, loue, and honour him: it teacheth to knowe the Diuell, and howe to blesse vs from him. By Learning comes Wisedome, by Learning ill vsed, commes folly: by Learning comes Fame: by learning comes fauour, of the highest: by learning comes all goodnesse: by Learning comes that honour, that longest dooth endure: for after death, Fame of Learning

If then Fame bée the chiefe Honour of the learned, which well considered, is neither any thing in substaunce, nor yet durable: then this Honour (though manie wayes something,) yet in some it is nothing.
               Wherefore, leauing Honour, let mée see what thing is Vertue: Oh, a heauenly thing, it is that which maketh the Souldiour by valure Honourable, and by the helpe of Learning Famons: It is the enemie to vice, it is that which aduanceth the poore, and makes the Rich honoured: It is an Honour, that the most honourable doo most honour: it is in summe, the woonder of the worlde, the staye of Wisedome, and the high way to Heauen: and can this so woorthie a thing be thought nothing? Oh yea, and howe? Alas Money is such a thing, as without that thing, there is nothing accounted in a manner anie thing. Vertue is a Iewell they say, but it is of small price, who will giue any money for it? Nay, more, who will not for money become vicious of Uertuous? Alas, too te

Some will say, it is, that keepes Princes in peace, and Countreys in quiet: of peace comes plentie, of plentie Pleasure: Pleasure maintaines health, and health makes a merry heart, and all this comes of heartie friendship.

Then beeing but a fained thing (as many other are) let it passe as these things for a thing of nothing: which being knowne to be nothing but a fained thing, let it rest in substance nothing, (though in conceite, a secret thing) which may prooue in a manner (well considered) nothing. But nowe there is a newe Nothing (as yet) vnspoken of, which if a wise man heard mee keepe such a prating to my selfe about nothing, hee would hang it on my sleeue for a rewarde, for him that deserues no better thing. Well, the cheefe nothing of all, which is the nothing at all, that is the nothing that I see here to delight me, which made me vse all this speech of nothing.
               
                  But whome doo I see yonder before me? What is it a man? Why? then there is some company so comfort mee in this calamitie: then that is some thing, yet to driue mee out of this nothing. Well, I will rise to him, to see what hee is? and whither he trauailes, whence he came, and what he intends to doo? It seemes a stout fellow, by his sterne looke: it seemeth by his Warlike countenaunce, hee should be a Souldiour. A Souldiour? what should he doo heere abouts? without a Captaine, farre from any towne, and alone without company? Is he not some outlawe, that liueth here in the Wildernesse? who takes the spoile of such poore Trauailers as my selfe: and héereby it may bee, hée hath more company at hand, eyther in their caues, or in the Wooddes heereby, God knoweth. Well, I hope the best, that hee may yet bee some man that trauailes this way in Gods peace, meaning neither me nor any else harme.
               Therfore, towards him I will, and therwithall vp he rose, and to him he went: but what Countrey man mayhe be? I will see. And so when he came somewhat néere vnto him, he vsed his speeche.

Alas for him, the Souldiour must haue his meate when he can get it, and take paines himselfe to dresse it, and eate it perhaps at midnight, disgest it as he may, giue God thanks for it, and think himselfe happie if he so may haue it. Therefore in respect of the Souldiours life, for his fare, the Scholler is at farre better state then the Souldiour: but then for honour, the life of the Souldiour.

               The Souldiour.
               For that the Scholler sits alwaies crouding at home in his Chamber, eating vp the wealth of his Countrey, with his nose ouer the fire, or lapped vp in a furred Gowne, to defende him from the cold of the winter: and in Summer plucking vppe the Flowers that should beautifie the grounde, and so goes he plodding vp and downe, with his eyes bended downewardes, as though he were seeking Pearles among Pybles, or else staring into the Element, as though he watched when the man in the Moone would come out among the starres: And when they come in againe, then they fall to reading of one booke or other, sometime they reade the famous acts of gallant Souldiours, such as Caesar, Alexander, Hanniball, Hector, Achilles, (and many other that I leaue to recount) whose victorious deedes they take pleasure to peruse, but the

base minded fellowes, are neuer the more readie, or willing to stirre their owne foote out of he Countrey, to see an inch of seruice.
            
            
               The Scholler.
               Oh good sir, speake not so in discommendation of a Scholler: for why, if he sit at home (as you say) hee is not idle, when hée is reading on his booke, and when hée leeketh downwardes, it is because (his hrains beeing busted about studie) hee would not lift vp his eyes, least the beholding of some vaine thing or other (which the worlde is full of) should carrie away his wittes with a wanton delight, from his desire otherwise determined. If hee lift them vp into the Heauens, it is either for heartie repentance he makes vnto God for his offences: or else for his grace, to studie no higher causes, then may be graunted with his fauour.
               Nowe, though hée stare, as you tearme, vppon the Moone and Starres, to marke their courses, and by them to discerne and note further causes: it argues not therefore, that he watcheth a man in the Moone: For indeede I haue studied somewhat my selfe, and I haue contemplated the Skie, the Sunne, the Moone, and Starres, and this I will say, I haue diuerse times séene a man or two in the Sunne, but in the Moone neuer any: therefore he was

               Now for your noble Captaines, whose triumphant déedes you speake of, that Schollers take delight to reade, but not to follow: You are deceyued, for there bée Schollers that beare as high mindes, and as valiant heartes, as any men, and to tell trueth, a good Captaine was first a Scholler, who pursuing the valiant déedes of other men, hath béene by them set on to attempt the like enterprises:

anything. And so hee meant it to the discommendation of their Cowardise, in kéeping farre enough from the fight: Or else he meant, hée pr

                  ted more himselfe, then any ten Souldiours in the Campe. But happie it was for him that the day went of his side, though the victorie came not by his eloquence: I graunt hee did great good with his perswasions, for in déede good wordes will moue much: especially, in good causes as that was: besides God is good, and he dooth commonly giue the good victorie: and if he suffer them to be ouerthrowen, it is for a further good he meanes them.
               Nowe therefore, if he had giuen the chiefe glorie to God, and the rest to the valiaunt Captaines and Souldiours: in my iudgement, he had done wel: but to come out with Plus ego, me thinkes he played the foole, Ipse. Againe, whereas you speake of the great fauour of Schollers, that they doo vnto Souldiours, in setting foorth their famous deedes, I must giue them commendation for their paines, but for Honour, confesse who deserues more Honour, the man that dooth the déede, or he that wrytes of it, when it is done.
               I graunt Learning an ornament, and a necessarie appertinent vnto a Souldiour. Otherwise in deede, it is harde for him to bée a good Captaine, for by Learning, he knowes vpon what cause it is good to beginne warre: and warre offered, vpon what cause it growes, and if it bee without cause, howe good then is the defence. Else if a Souldiour will vpon a fagarie, or madde humour in the heade, goe showe his great businesse and little wit, hee knowes not, nor cares not, vpon whome, where, or for what cause: I will say his foolishnesse makes him vnworthie of the name of a Souldiour: his deedes worthie to bee put in obliuion, and himselfe vnwoorthie honour. Therefore I confesse, a good Captaine, had neede to

But yet I say still, the Souldiour is to bée honoured, both of the Scho:ler, and the vnlearned: of the Scholer for his Wisedome, with valure: and of the other for his

               The Scholler.
               This I say: the grounde, I thinke was before the Grasse, the tree before the fruite, the Plaine song before the Deskant, and so foorth. The ground I must confesse, is worthie loue, for bringing foorth Grasse: so is Grasse to be loued for the Cattailes sake that it feedes, which wee

                   by. Nowe if the ground brought out nothing but Mosse, then were it little to be loued: againe, the Grasse cut, and not well handled, would doo little good, and were worthie as little loue. The Tree were ill, would beare no Fruite: and the Fruite ill, would please no taste: the Plaine song, were plaine stuffe, without Deskant, and the Deskant were a madde péece of Musicke, without Plaine song to be the ground.
               But as the ground for the Grasse, so the Grasse for his

In summe, I know no man excellent in anie thing without learning, which is the grounde of all excellencie. If then learning be excellent, the tune that is spent in that is most excellently well bestowed, which time may be well called the Schollers time, and the scholler for so well bestowing that time, most worthie to bée honoured. Now what say you for the Souldiour?
            
            
               The Souldiour.
               Marrie this I say, the better the grasse, the more is the ground esteemed: and till the grounde beare grasse, what was it to be estéemed? but as barrain, and therfore a thing of little woorth: but when it brings foorth good grasse, then it is called a fatte grounde, good ground, & so forth. Marrie if this grounde lie in a colde corner, it will be long ere the grasse spring, and being come vp, it commonly proues sower, and dooth not so soone nor so well fatten the Cattell, as other that lyeth somewhat néere the sunne. Againe, if the grounde lye verie high, and neere the sunne, then is the Grasse so parched with the heate, that there is little swéetenesse left

                  n it for the Cattell.

Then must it be kept with watering, to coole the heate, and to refresh the roote of the grasse withall. Againe, the cold grounde must be often dunged, thereby to giue it more heate, and with that warmth, to comfort the roote of the grasse, that it may the better come vp.
               Now I do not denie, but these grounds may bee both indu
                     •…
                  erent good in their kinds, after they haue beene wel vsed as I say. But the ground is to be considered of, according to his nature: and if the grounde be of nature to beare grasse, and such common hearbs as will feede Cattell, it is not to be despised. But if it bee of nature to bring foorth flowers, hearbes, rootes, and fruites, for man himselfe to feede on, is it not to bee made account off, farre aboue the other? Yes surely. And this minde am I of, that at the first Creation, when God had made the Earth, hée gaue it a secret nature to bring forth Fruits, but many sundrie grounds, sundrie kinds of Natures, which according to the same are to be esteemed. God when he had made the grounde, he saide, let vs garnish it with Grasse, Flowers, Hearbs Trees, and Fruits, and so foorth.
               Nowe he thought it not worthie the looking on till it had brought foorth the Fruites, Flowers, and Hearbs, which his heauenly Maiestie had giuen it a secret Nature to bring foorth, to beautifie it selfe with all. Which Flowers and fruites, some hee sawe heere, some there, and according to the Fruites, hee estéemed the plotte of grounde whereon they grew: therefore say 
                     •…
                  , the ground is to be thought off according to the goodnesse of the fruits, which naturally and not by helpe, it brings foorth. The Trée was before the Fruit, but till such time, as it brought foorth fruite, what was it but a stocke? not worthy the proyning.
               Now there are diuers Trées, which according to the nature of the Soyle wherein they grew, bring

The temperate Soile, bringes foorth fruite, neyther too watrishe, nor yet too drie, but betwixt both. Nowe, the Trees are to bee thought off, according to their fruites: is not the Cinamon trée to be estéemed aboue the Apple trée? is not the Damson Trée, to be made accoumpt off, aboue the Blackthorne trée? Is not the Pippin tree, to bee esteemed aboue the Crabbe trée? The Abr

                  ocke, aboue the common Plum? and the Cherrie aboue the Hauthorne berrie? Yes out of doubt, according to the sweetenesse of the taste, is the fruite to beloued,. In the Garden of Paradize, there were diuers fruite Trees, and fruites, but one théefe that was to bee honoured aboue all other: for féeding whereof, man was driuen out of the grounde, and forst with toile, to▪ get his liuing abroade in the world, with Gods high displeasure. Therefore some Trées are aboue other to be honoured: Plaine Song is good Musick, but not so good as when the Deskant is made to goe with it.
               Now there are diuers grounds, which according to the Deskants are to bee estéemed: What swéeter hermony, then among the Byrdes of the field? what Byrd so

Learning, for his sight in diuers Artes. But now men are borne vnder diuers Planets: as some vnder Iupiter, those are imperious fellowes, those are good to bee Princes: some vnder Saturne, they are frowarde of Nature, and good to make Lawiers: some vnder Venus, & they are good to make Solicitors of Loue: some vnder Mercurie, and they are good to bee Secretaries, for they are (commonly) ingenious: some vnder Sol, those are hote fellowes, those are good to make Marriners, they may best abide the colde of the Water: some vnder Luna, and they are weake of Nature, and subiect to much sicknesse, those are good to make Phisitians, to helpe themselues, and other that hath néede of them: some vnder Mars, and they are the men that prooue the gallant Souldiours.
               Now if the Scholler bee borne vnder that Planet of Prowesse, and in his time of studie bee addicted to follow that which hee sees worthy Honour, which both reason perswades his minde, and Nature leades his body too: is not he worthy to bee honoured aboue the Scholler that is weake of Nature? and vnfit for any exercise of great honour?

               The Scholler.
               Syr, I must néedes say, you haue saide well for the Souldiour, but yet I must saye, that note the liues of them both, and you shall see the Schollers life most worthy honour: and why? the Scholler findeth (as you say) by discretion, whither his body be to his minde, and both apte for Armes: if not, yet he is ready and able to instruct those that are able, in those cheefe pointes that doo most appertaine vnto that Art. Wherby the willing minde hauing but litle knowledge) may speedily purchase great perfection by small experience.

In the meane time, I hope I haue offered none iniurie, in dooing them a courtesie: I craue pardon of none, for saying my minde, and good

            Some men may thinke, that some one Woman hath hired me, to flatter all, or else, by flattering of all, I shuld hop
                  •…
                of fauour of some one. Some will say, perhaps hee hath a Woman to his mother: some other, a Woman to his Mistresse: some other, he is sworne to the Candlesticke: other, it is pittie he was not made a woman: and some, oh he is a good Womans man.
            Now, all these I answere in their kindes: as all Women are not of one nature, so neither are all Natures of one disposition: as one loues to be flattered, so other loue to be flatlie dealt withall. Therefore if I shoulde seeke to flatter all, I should but floute my selfe: and commonly, the hyre of flatterie is but hate, which is so colde a comfort to any mans Conscience, as he were well woorthie of a frumpe for his folly, that would bée hyred, to such a seruice. Further, they are fooles that loue to bee flattered, and Women haue euer naturally had so much wit, as to finde a falsehood in a fayre tale. But if fayre woordes bee truly spoken, and by authoritie confirmed: they cannot but be as fréendlie taken, as fully allowed. Wherefore, my woords in their behalfe, shall shew testimony of my true meaning, else let me abide the slander, of such hipocrisie as is hatefull to an honest minde.
            That I haue a Woman to my Mother, I graunt, and am heartily glad off: for surely, he that is not borne of a Woman, wants a péece of a Man, and he that despiseth his Mother, in that shée is a Woman: is to be disdained him selfe, in that he is no Man. are we not commaunded by God, to honour Father and Mother: Is it not written in the holy Scriptures, Thou shalt honour thy Father, b

due reuerence: disdaine her not, for feare of Gods displeasure: discredit her not, for GOD and mans disliking: defame her not, for feare of thy Soules destruction.
            Now some will say, that I haue a Woman to my Mistresse, I not denie it, for Saintes are none vpon the earth, and Diuels I would be loath to do
                  •…
                seruice too. A Woman of honour, may well be Mistresse to a Man of worship: in reason consider, and grant me this: what Souldiour so valiant? what courtiour so fint? and what scholler fo profound: but will vse his armes, his allegaunce, and his art to win the fauour of his Mistresse.
            I haue heard some talke theyr pleasure in a heate, that the fayrest Lady in the world, shuld not make them steupe to their Lure. But when (without an Hostler) they walked themselues a cold: oh then ere long recant al, it was not I, and cry Pecca

            Now some wil say, that I am sworne to the candlestick, such I wish their noses in the socket. And this I say further, my faith was not yet so much had in question, to bee called to the Candlesticke: but if he that say so, haue beene brought to the like booke oath, I wish hee had eaten the stringes for his labour.
            Some will say, it is pittie he was not made a Woman: I woonder why? my beautie is not such, to allure a wanton eye, nor mine eye

            Some will say, Women are pittifull, howe is that knowne? by lookes and speeches: men are more: which is showen, as well in words of mouth, as writing.
            Some will say, a Woman is a wo to man, who put in that to, did it of his owne authoritie, and therefore it is not to be allowed.
            For consider right of the word, and the to is as well left out, as the worde falsely written, for indéede it ought to be written Woman, not Woman, for that shée dooth woo Man with her Uertues, who wedde

                her with vanitie. For man being of wit sufficient to consider of the Uertues of a Woman, is (as it were) rauished with the delight of those dainties, which do (after a sort) draw the senses of man to serue them.
            Now a Woman hauing not so déepe a capacitie to conceiue or iudge of the conditions of man, is onely wedded to his will: which thing how vaine it is, is seene when it is bent to little vertue.
            Some haue a delight to tearme Women by nickenames, as in the doore shée is an Image. But how wise is the man, that hath his wittes so cosened? to take one thing for another? They be Lunaticke, or in Loue, that worshippe such Idols. And this I will say further, if shée be an Image, shée is liker nothing then a man: in

she house, shée is a number of things: in the kitchin shée is a cormorant: I

In the milke house shée is a Catte: why? if shee milke a Cowe, is shée not worthie to taste it for her labour? In the Cheese shée is a Mouse: why? shée sette the Curdes together, should shée not taste the meate. In the bakehouse she is a Bée, for her busie stirring about. Yet her sting is but her tongue, that hurts no body, except shée be troubled: then allowe the Bée her Hiue, and let her rest. In the Buttrie shée is a Sprite, but shée dooth no hurt, but fray a Mouse from the bread, and a theefe from the Cubborde. In the Seller shee is a Sowe, and yet I haue seene one Dutch man drinke more then fiue English women. In the Hall shée is a Hare, but béeing tame, take heede how you hunt her.

            But well, if it were not for making women to be worse then they would be, I would tell them howe they might tear me men in sundrie places, both within and without the house. But let this suffice, I meane but onely to commende Women, and not offend men. And if I haue vnwittingly offended any, I willingly aske pardon of all, with promise of amendes, if my power serue me.

In fine, if hee haue any good qualitie, shee hath another.
            
               It were but a follie, to fill my Booke with examples, of this Woman for constancie, and that for fidelitie, an other for Huswiferie, and the other Woman, for worthie wit. Let this suffice in braefe, there is in sickenesse no greater comfort, in health no better companion, to a wise man, then a wittie woman.
            Nowe for wise women, I thinke his should shew him selfe a verie vnwise man that woulde wish for such a one. I remember a prettie speech, once vttered by a verie wise man: when a man (as it séemed) not verie wise, came to him for his counsaile, what he might doo, to come by a certaine Iewell, that was stollen from him out of his Chamber: and (hauing told his losse) before he would heare of his aduise. Sir (quoth he
                  •…
                were I not best to go to a wise woman. Yes marry (quoth hée) if you knewe where any such were. Meaning that they were so hard to hit on, that it were but follie to secke them. Nowe what pittie it is to sée some men so vnwise, to thinke such wisedome in any Woman: after he had lost his Iewell if hee would e haue lookt into himselfe, and found his owne follie, before hee had seught such wisedome in a woman: hee should haue seene that it were more wisdome for a man, to keepe that he hath warely, then vnwisely to runne to a woman, to seeke for wit how to finde it againe.
            But I will stand no more vpon this poynt, let it suffice that it is wisedome for a man to take heede, that a Woman be not wiser then himselfe: and howe wise so euer he bee, to count them no fooles. For in déede, as the common Prouerbe is, The wit of a Woman is a great matter: and true, when a man with all his wisedome, is sometime to learne wit of her.
            In mine opinion, I heard a verie wise speech of a verie wittie Woman, touching the wisedome (if any) that ought to bee in a Woman. In a Mayde, to take care in choyse of a Husbande: in a marryed woman, to loue

none but her husband: in a widow, to prouide for her children: in an old woman, to haue care of her end.
            Now for men, if a Batcheler take heed what wife hée takes, and hauing taken a wife, to loue no other woman: a Widdower, to looke for his children, before a newe wife, and an olde man his graue: is it amisse? no I warrant yee. Nowe men must bee wise, in caring for Women, and themselues to, and Women no wyser, then in caring for such men as care for them. But if a man bée so vnwise to trouble a Womans wit to care for him? howe wise is hee? and what a wit hath shoe. Confesse you that haue guiltie consciences, and learne to bee wise: and thinke this sufficient commendation for a Woman, if shee bee a Uirgin for chastitie, with Uirginitie vertuous, of condition courteous, and true of loue: such a Woman ought to bee, and if such they be not, pray for them as I dee, and such as are, honour them as worthie: and for their sakes, all other whatsoeuer they bee, iudge the best till you see the contrarie: and where you knowe it, shake your heade and say nothing: but it is pittie, God hath done his part in her, God amend her: put the fault in pride, and not in her. And you shall fee such a chaunge, that it was not shee, no forsooth (as little children say) it was the Bulbegger.
            They say nowe, the worlde is towardes the last yeare, and men towarde theyr last wittes: then let Women bee towardes their first Wisedome. And if they shew but little Wisedome: yet let that haue such commendation, that they may bee encouraged, to continue and encrease the same. For surely (well considered) a man can not do honour to a more worthie person, then a Woman. Is it not an abuse in a man to disprayse his friende? What greater friend to a man, then a Woman? who can discommend that he loues? except he dissemble sore? hypocrisie is as ill as heresie. What can a man loue more

then a Woman? what, such loue as betwixt them? Marrie some will say, they must loue déerely, or hate deadly. God forbidde, that anie man should bée out of charitie: I would thinke it a harde matter to hate a woman. Yet since it is possible to doo little better: I thinke it wisdome to conceale it, for there is nothing gotten by reuealing it.
            Well, not to séeme tedious, let me drawe towards an ende: thinke well of as many as you may, loue whome you haue cause, hate none, whatsoeuer you thinke, say nothing in their dishonour, least you growe in their vtter dislyking: and then your roome as good as your company. When you seeke for fauonr, take a flowte with you: I maruaile you can away so long with a Womans companie, 
                  •…
               c.
            But well, to anoyde the frumpes, flowtes, skowles, disdainefull spéeches, quippes, tauntes, and angrie couutenaunces, that Women will soone bestow, where they sée cause, doo this: if you cannot loue, yet doo not loath: if you will not honour, yet doo not hate: if your conscience let you not, commend them, yet let your courtesie not let you doo the contrarie. Remember your Mother, forget not your friend▪ offend not your Mistresse, and make much of your selfe: If you like my counsaile, followe it: if not disdaine it not: if you loue a Woman, remember mée: if you care for none, wee will none of vs trouble you: if wee doo it, it is agaynst our willes. But who is he that loues not a Woman? and wherefore then will any looke awrie vpon mée? I knowe not, and shall I say I care not? Well, let it goe, since it is not, I doo all for the best, and I trust the best will take it so: as for the rest, there lyes neither life nor death vpon a looke, and therefore hoping the best, I will not doubt the contrarie. And if men be as well contented with me for this prayse of Women, as I am determined to content them, with the like of them

héereafter: if will be not froward, and Wit faile me not, I trust the Ace of Diamonds will go to the stocke, and cuerie man will be pleased. In the meane time aboute some better worke, then I meane to make boast of: I must attend my Haruest, ere I fall to Hawking.
            Thus if I said anie thing amisse, God forgiue mée: if I haue sayde well, God bée thanked, take it among you: if I haue said truly, it is not to be blamed, if otherwise, I haue but spoken mine opinion, which I hope to see fully approued. And so sorie, if I haue sayd that the wise will mistike, and glad if I haue written, that the good will take well. I conclude of a suddaine, with this short sentence, Hic & haec homo, Considera quid mulier, Like of them as you list, loue whom you can: when you séeke for fauour. God send you good fortune. And so fare you well.

               Why, I haue the grace of GOD, but I want the wealth of the world, to grace my selfe withall.
            
            
               Patience.
               Alas, the brauerie of the world is but beggerie before God. And the rich man to heauen, goes as a Cammell through a needles eye.

               Yea, but begging is a vile life in the meane time.

               Then worke.
