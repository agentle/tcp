do so moche yf he myght / that another tyme he myghte
gete the pryce / but not for enuye of the honoure of his felowe.
But good courage and good wyll caused hym to
haue those thoughtes. On the other partye the kynge allredy
entred in to his chambre for to go vnto his rest / the
quene also thought excessyuely on the feest that she had
sene the daye tofore. And in especyall on the two yonge

that they were accustomed for to ryse in the courte / 
Olyuer and his felowe Arthur arose and made them redy
in the same wyse that they were accustomed / and in
that estate they wente in to the kynges court. Whan the
quene sawe them / she made them better semblaunce / &
better chere than she shas wonte to doo / and called the

kynges sone aboute the necke / and badde them good morowe.
And sayd alowe bytwene her tethe. Olyuer my

or other feates of armes that apperteyned to ony
noble prynce. And whan that he knewe of ony greate
assemble / he wolde not haue fayled but that he wolde haue
ben there
                  •
                whether that he had ben ferre or nere / and
therfore euery body had grete Ioye of hym / and sayd it
was a grete reioysynge to the kynge of Castyll the whiche
was alredy ferre altred in aege for to se his only sone
& heyre so replenysshed in all vertuous operacyons / 
but fortune the whiche is maystresse of all aduersyte &
sorowes aduychylled his cōsolacyon / & separed frō hym
his electe welfare by ye quene his wyfe. The whiche be
holdynge the gyfte of grace that nature had gyuen hym
so fayre a chylde / she was soo taken with his loue that it
is meruayll to recounte it / for whan she was by herselfe
in ony secrete place alone / as in her bedde / or elles where
she sayd full often. Ha a Olyuer ryght fayre creature y•
treasoure of my thoughtes. Iowe well for to curse thy
resplendysshynge beaute / for I am constrayned for thy
excellence to do the thynge that neuer quene dyde / for I
must habandon the loue of my lorde / and husbande for
thyne. And yf that thou haue not compassyon vpon me
the surplus of my dayes shal be in anguyssh and dolour
In this wyse the quene complayned so longe / that Olyuer
and his felowe came for to se her. Whome she receyued
with Ioyous semblaunt. And whan ony persone
axed her wherfore she shewed more sygne of amyte to olyuer
than she dyde to Arthur her owne sone / she sayd
that she dyde it for to please the kynge y• better with all
She toke Olyuer by the hande and made hym by force
for to sytte downe besyde her. And began for to deuyse
with hym of dyuers maters / and amonge other deuyses

she demaūded hym by the fayth of his body / yf that he
were not amorous of some fayre lady. And he sayd naye
And then she sayd vnto hym Olyuer my loue. I can not
byl
                  •
               ue that the whiche ye haue spoken. And therfore I
requyre you that ye tell me the trouthe in what place she
remayneth that is so eurous for to be your louer. Madame
answered Olyuer / in good fayth she hathe none a
bydynge. For there is so many excellent ladyes in this
realme / that I can not tell the whiche I may loue. And
also I doubte to be refused. Wherfore madame I know
well that ye do but mocke with me / for she sholde be but
a lytell happy for to haue my loue. For I am not a man
that as yet hathe done ony thynge / wherof I oughte to
enquyre ony lady of loue. And therfore vnto this houre
I haue not done so moche / nor wonne / wherfore I oughte
to be contente. The quene herynge the answer of y•
yonge knyght / was sore abasshed. For the more that she
deuysed with hym / the more she founde hym constaunt
and ferme in his purpose / and alwaye she contynued in
her folye / in so moche that Olyuer apperceyued a parte
of her wyll and desyre. Wherfore he helde his peas and
spake not so moche as he had done before. And she seynge
that she spake no more sayd vnto hym. My frende yf
ony grete maystresse requyred you of loue / wolde ye refuse
her / certes madame sayd he. I am not soo happy / 
nor no woman so folysh / for to requyre me of loue / and
therfore there is none answer.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer departed sore troubled of the requestes
that his stepmoder had made to hym. And how ye
he prayed to our lorde / for to reuoke her from her folys

               OLyuer that was not well pleased for to be
in suche deuyses with his fayre moder / made
to his felowe a sygne that he sholde calle
hym the whiche dyde so / and sayd. My broder
the houre passeth that we sholde go there
as ye wote of / and therfore I put you in remembraū
               ce.
Olyuer answered that it was true. And then he toke
his leue of the quene / the whiche dydde strayne his fyngres
togyder at the departynge Olyuer was thā ryght
dyspleasaūt bycause that he knewe her in suche estate / 
but he durst make

as they were out of the quenes chambre / the quene drew
herselfe aparte in to a lytell garderobe / and lete herselfe
fall vpō a bedde / and sayd vnto her selfe. My loue ye be
not soo folysshe / but that ye knowe thaffayre in the whiche
I am oppressyd / and certaynly it shall not be lefte
thus / for to morowe ye shall haue knowlege of all my sorowe / 
and dysease And also Olyuer vpon that other syde / 
was in grete thought as well as y• quene his stepmoder
was / for whan he was in his lodgys / he wente in to
his chambre all alone / where as he dyde saye knelynge / 
My blessyd creatour thou hast formed me vnto thy semblaunce

I am worthy for to haue / the whiche shall because of my

Wherfore I praye the that thou wouchesauf for to kepe

for I wyll not accorde therto for to deye. And therfore
I requyre you with humble herte that it wyll please
y• for to take her out of that dampnable opynyon / and
that thou reduce / an brynge her into suche estate / and
wyll / that as a good and loyall spouse / she may kepe her
towarde her husbande.
         
         
            ¶How the quene yet agayne declared her courage
to Olyuer / the whiche was / that she wolde that he
sholde do her dysordynate wyll / and ye fayre answers
that Olyuer gaue her. Capitulo. ix.
            
               
               
            
            
               ON the morowe after that Olyuer was comē
in to his faders courte / aboute the houre
of dyner / he durste not leue his olde custome / 
the whiche was / for to go and vysyte
the quene / and also to the ende that none
sholde apperceyue his affayre. In contynent as he had
salued her / he withdrewe hym in to the thyckest prees of
the ladyes / bycause that he wolde not be alone with the
quene his stepmoder / but that auaylled hym but lytell / 
For the quene without ony shame wente and fetched hȳ
agayne / and toke hym by the hande / saynge that she
wolde speke with hȳ. And by forse whether he wolde or

not she made hym for to sytte downe by her. And satte
thynkȳge / and musynge a grete whyle / and sayd neuer
a worde. Whā the quene sawe that he sayd neuer a worde / 
she was halfe ashamed and chaunged coloure / and
sayd to hym. My loue haue ye no remembraunce of the
deuyses that we had togyder. Truely madame sayd Olyuer.
My memorye is so small / that I haue reteyned
but lytell / or nought. Ha my swete herte sayd the quene
I suppose y• your vnderstondynge is not so dull / to forgete
in so shorte space / that the whiche is sayd vnto you
But I apperceyue by your langage / that ye knowe my
mynde better than I can recorde it to you. Madame I
wote not what ye wolde saye. Certaynly sayd she my loue / 
to y• ende that ye knowe it. I tell you that I wyl be
yours. And therfore I gyue me vnto you all holly. It
is not of newe that ye be lorde ouer me / and of my wyll / 
But fere / & shame hathe caused me to kepe it close by
lōge space of tyme. Neuerthelesse all doubtes put abacke
I put you in memorye that I am not of your kȳred
so nere / but hat ye may do all your pleasure with me / as
ye wolde do to your lady and loue / and I also of you in
lyke wyse / wher thrugh we may haue incōpreable Ioy
and solace togyder. And yf that my fortune be so vnhappy / 
that my request be not vttred I shall occyse myselfe
And therfore my loue / in you lyeth my lyfe and my deth
whan Olyuer vnderstode this / he was more abasshed
than euer he was before / and sayd vnto her in this wyse
Madame where as ye say that ye loue me I thanke you
hertly and as for that / that ye name you my louer / it can
not be no gretter than it is as for my parte / for as vnto
my moder / and maystresse / there is no seruyce but that
I wyll do it at your commaundemēt / as I am bounde

for to do. I can not thynke that ye be so chyldysshe that
ye wolde loue me otherwyse than a good moder sholde / 
and ought to loue her chylde. For I holde my selfe for suche
one / that I had leuer deye than for to do ony thynge
that were contrary to the honour of the kynge my fader
And yf that I dyde otherwyse / the houre of my byrth
ought well to be cursed.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer refused all the requestes of his fayre
stepmoder. And how she menased hym vnto the dethe.
Capitulo. x.
            
               THe quene ryght furyously / and Irefully brake
his wordes in sayng. Olyuer cursed be
thy beaute / whan y• thou arte so eleuate in

fro hens forth / ye name of a frende y• was gyuen
to the by me / and that hathe ben fyxed in the profoū
               denesse
of my secrete thoughtes / and also ye reioycynge
of my herte / by thy grete outragyous cruelte shall be torned
in to grete amerenes. For I shall name the my mortall
enemye / as one that is a destroyer / and sleer of ladyes.
For thou arte a murderer of me / and shall be cause of
my deth / and that ryght shortly. But it shall not be with
out the. For in all the maners / and facyons that can be / 
vnto me possyble I shall abredge thy lyfe. For me thynketh
that it is reason syth that I must dye for the / and ye
thou arte cause of my dethe / that thou be parteyner of
my dolour and anguysshe / notwithstandynge I praye
to our lorde that he pardōne the / the innumerable euyll

les that by the are lykly for to befall. And then she sayd
vnto hym. Aryse of my quysshen / and go thy waye / for
it is impossyble to me / for to be here in the presence of the
people / withoute that my sorowe shall be apperceyued / 
Olyuer arose and toke his leue of the quene / the whiche
went in to a lytell chambre / where as she demeaned her
sorowe so meruaylously that it were impossyble for to 
                  •
               ecounte / 
and tell it. Olyuer wente towarde the kynge &
salued hym. Soo after that he had ben there a whyle he
wente vnto his place / and his felowe with hym / whiche
knewe full well that his broder made not soo good chere
as he was accustomed for to doo / and demaunded hym
what meuyd hym / that he was so sadde. And whan he
sawe that he wolde not tell hym / he thought in hymselfe
that he wolde not demaunde hym no more / leste that he
sholde be dyspleased with hym. All that daye Olyuer a
bode in this chambre / and for to couer the better his dyspleasure / 
he made his men for too vnderstande that he
was not well at ease / and that he was a lytell dysmayde
For the whiche thȳge his felowe Arthur was ryght do
lent / and sorowfull / but it was impossyble to hym for to
amende it / this notwithstandynge / he wolde not departe
from hym / but after so
                  •
               per Olyuer requyred hym y•
he wolde go towarde the kynge / and the ladyes for that
nyght. And that he wolde kepe hym without makynge
ony mensyon of his sykenes / and that at his comynge
agayne he sholde fynde hȳ a bedde. So at the request of
his broder he was contente for to goo / and sayd to hym / 
My good broder Olyuer it is your wyll that I shall go
in to the courte / and bycause that it shall be late or that
I come agayne / and that I myght happen awake you
I hydde you good nyght. And I pray god gyue you go

               
                  •
               e rest so that your sykenesse may to morowe be aledged
And tolde hym that he wolde not lye with hym ye nyght
Then Olyuer embrased hym / with the teres in his eyen
and sayd to Arthur that he abode ouer longe. Arthur
apperceyued the teres in his eyen / wherfore he was sore
abasshed. For he knewe hȳ for suche a man / that he dyscomforted
hym not for a lytell thynge / neuerthelesse he
made no semblaunt / but departed with grete lamētacy
on. Alas yf he had knowen wheron his felowe dyde thȳ
               ke / 
his sorowe wolde haue doubled / for he sawe hym not
after vnto the tyme that they hadde bothe suffred many
aduersytees / as ye shall here more playnly afterwarde.
            
               
            
         
         
            
            ¶How Olyuer abode all alone in his chambre / where
as he made dyuers complayntes / and lamentacyons / 
and of the lettre that he wrote vnto his felowe
Arthur / and at what thynge he sholde haue knowlege / 
yf he hadde ony euyll aduenture. Capitulo. xi.
            
               AS Olyuer sawe that he was left alone / and
that his loyall felowe was gone / he abode al
pensyf / and sadde. And sayd vnto his chamberlayne
that he wolde go vnto bedde / and
y• he sholde make euery body to auoyde for
that nyght. And badde his chamberlayne that he sholde
make prouysyon of paper / and ynke. So whan euery body
was departed / and that there was no moo lefte with
in the chambre but his chamberlayne / he made hym redy
and wente to bedde. And then he badde his chamberlayne
that he sholde go his waye for that nyght / for there
is one that wyll lye with me / the whiche wyll not be
knowen. The chamberlayne dyde his lordes commaundement / 
and departed / and shytte the dore after hym.
And whan that Olyuer saw that euery body was auoyded / 
there is no herte may thynke / nor expresse / the innumerable
lamentacyōs that he made. And fyrste of all the
grete goodes / and honour / that in that countree he had
receyued. And after / for the ryght bytter dolour that
for his sake were lykly for to come / as well vnto the kynge
his fader / as vnto his felowe / and in generall al them
of the kȳges courte / where as he was so derely byloued
This notwithstandynge he concluded in hymselfe that
he wolde departe habandonnynge londes / possessyons / 
and honours / saynge that the worldly honours / were nothynge

in comparyson of the spyrytuelles / y• whiche hathe
neuer ende / and sayd that he oughte not for to kepe
his carcas so deyntely / that was ordeyned in this worlde
for to be wormes mete / as his honour and his soule / 
the whiche sholde be tormented in helle / yf that he wold
byleue the dampnable opynyon of his fayre moder. He
thought in hymselfe that it were better for hym for to departe
be tymes / than ouer late / for he had no more trust
nor confydens in the quene / seynge and consyderynge y•
wordes that she had sayd vnto hym. Then he toke the
paper and the ynke / and began for to wryte a lettre the
whiche adressyd vnto his felowe. In the whiche after y•
gretynges and salutacyons / made as amyably as ony
myght be made / he put in y• lettre that for certayne causes
he was departed from the courte in praynge hym ryghte
debonayrly that he wolde pardon hym of that that
he had not aduertysed hym of his departyng / for certaȳ
               ly
it had ben impossyble vnto hym / for to haue departed
in his presence. And this notwithstandynge yf that he
were ferre from his syghte / yet he sholde not be longed
from his herte / for in what coūtre / or in what place that
euer he were / he wolde holde hym for his good broder / &
frende / and that neuer on his syde he wolde forgete hȳ
Afterwarde he prayed hym that he wolde make his recommendacyons
ryght humbly vnto his fader the kynge
and the quene / and vnto all theym the whiche sholde
demaunde after hym. And then he wrote aboue. My broder
bycause that I wote neuer whā I shall se you agayne.
I leue with you this lytell glasse / the whiche is ful of
clere water as ye may see / and I praye you that ye loke
euery daye ones vpon it for my loue / for yf I haue ony

a good waye from the kynges courte / and at that tyme
there dwelled no body nor none of his seruauntes / and

hym that it was Englande. Wherof the
knyght that was with Olyuer / was moche
reioysed / notwithstandynge that he was sore syke. And
enquyred of his hoost yf he knewe not a knyghte that
was called syr Iohā Talbot. He answered / that he had
often herde speke of suche one / but he neuer sawe hym / 
but he saed that his pryncypall abydyng was in Caunterburye / 
as they sayd all aboute / and sayd that he was
but twenty myle from thens. Thenne the syke knyght
sayd vnto hym / blessyd be god that hathe brought vs he
ther / for I am that same syr Iohan Talbot / that I spered
after afore / and my dwellynge is in the cyte of Caū

And bycause that I knowe that without the

and also that I fele my dethe approcheth. I beseche you
that ye make me to be caryed to Caunterbury / to the ende
that I may make my testament / & ordynaunces as a

I shall neuer habandon you / yf that it please you / tyll y•

that he requyred none other thynge / and all was at the

And then he was caryed in a hors bere to his place / and
Olyuer rode with hym / but he lyued not longe after he

of the knyght ryght honourably / for whiche cause
he was moche praysed of euery body / and to the contrary
the frendes of the deed bodye / was moche blamed as
it was ryght. Olyuer the whiche had but a lytell money

where as he herde tytynges that the kynge of Englande /

thynke that for the welfare of the countree / it was more

foure hōdred knyghtes commysed of within for to resyste

that he had but lytell moneye for to go theder withall
Neuerthelesse he made hymredy for to be there / in the

after departed frome the cyte of Caunterbury / 
all alone withouten ony company towarde the cyte
of London. Where as the grete / and solempne feest / 

sholde be holden. And therfore dyuers grete lordes were
comen theder all redy. And there came so many that
all the lodgynges / and ynnes were full. Soo as Olyuer
exployted hym so on his Iourneye that he was a good
dele auaunged / as he the whiche thought that he sholde
neuer come theder tyme ynoughe / for to se her for whose
loue he toke that Iourneye / and so he passed on his way
in suche thoughtes / and in those thoughtes he came into
a lytell busshy wodde / somwhat out of his hye waye / &
he had not longe gone therin / whan he mette .xv. theues
the whiche were armed in complete harnays / and cryed
to hym saynge that he was but deed / and he was enuyronned
with them or euer he loked vp / and lefte his pen

without medlynge / he sette his hande to his swerde and
smote one of them vpō the heed so asprely / that he claue

smote on the ryght hande / and on the lefte hande / so impyteously
that he cutte armes / and hedes / in a suche wyse / 
that the hardyest of them durst not abyde hym a buffet / 
for he had sette his backe agaynst a thycke hedge / so
that his enemyes myght not endommage hym behynde
And for to make it shorte he dyde so moche by the helpe
of god / that he slewe .xi. of them / and the remenaūt fledso

of them / he thanked god of that vyctorye / and alyghted
of his hors / and tayde hym to a tree / and then he began
for to bynde some of his woundes / in the beste wyse
that he myght / but they were not mortall / wherof he gaue
thankȳges to god. And so as he toke kepe to his woū
               des / 
his hors brake loose / for he had not tayed hym fast.
And so wente awaye with his casket of moneye the whiche

was at the arson of the sadell / and was gone all redy
a good waye or euer Olyuer apperceyued hym. Neuerthelesse
whan that the apperceyued hym / he begāne for

And in that estate the hors came rennynge bofore the
place where one of the theues was hydde / that had escaped
from Olyuer. And whan the sayd thefe saw the horse / 
he knewe hym well ynoughe / and ranne after hym / &
toke hym / and incontynente mounted vpon his backe / 
and rode his waye with casket and all. Whan Olyuer
apperceyued hym / he knewe well ynoughe y• he had lost
his horse / and his casket with moneye / wherfore ye may
well thynke that he was ryght dysplesaunt / for he founde
hymselfe without moneye / and also in a straunge coū

where as he hadde no knowledge / and whan he saw
that all was lost / he sayd to hymselfe. O good swete lorde
Ihesu cryst I requyre y• comforte this poore vnhappy

And Olyuer answered hym. My fayre fader I praye

for I knowe none other place here aboute / where as I
myght go to. And then the holy mā sayd vnto hym. My

they wente to rest / but Olyuer slepte not so well nor
so longe in the mornynge / as yf he had layne on a fether

wyse theyr harneys / wherin he toke no grete pleasure
bycause he doubted yt his knyght sholde forgete hym
And bycause that the tyme was shorte / he was in grete
doubte / and repented hym sore that he had byleued hȳ
so lyghtly. And that also in the meane whyle that he had
soiourned in the hermytage / that he had not gone in to
the cyte / for to se her for whose loue so many noble men
put themselfe in payne and Ieoperdye / and of whome
he had herde so moche good spokē of / but he durste not
habandonne the hermytage / lest that his knyght sholde
not fynde hym in defaute / saynge that he was not there
as he hadde appoynted hym to abyde. And in that estate
he passed the two dayes. And whan it came vnto y•
daye that euery gentylman and lorde oughte for to be &

fynde hymself vpon the lystes / and ye may ymagyne in
what dolour was the poore Olyuer. And yf that his herte

thought that it was some grete gentylman that rode

These wordes fynysshed y• knyght sayd to hym that it
was hye houre for to arme hym. And therfore in a fayre
grene place y• was afore y• hermytage / there was a chayre
brought / wherin Olyuer set hym for to take his refeccyon / 
and then after they armed hym dylygently In y•
meane whyle that he armed hym / the ladyes came in to
the felde / and brought with them y• fayre Helayne doughter
of the kynge of Englande / and ledde her in to the
pauelyon that for her was ordeyned / and it was hanged
with tapysserye of clothe of golde ryght ryche / and
there was a chayre reysed vp on hye in ye whiche chayre
was .x. steppes or that they myght come to ye syege aboue / 
ouer the whiche was a canape of purple veluet charged
full of grete perles oryentales / and had in the myddes
therof a Carbuncle / that rendred so grete lumere y•
it was meruayll for to beholde it. In the syege aboue as
I haue receyted to you was sette the excellent Helayne / 
And vpon eche of the forsayd steppes satte two Iuges.
That is for to knowe a prynce / and a pryncesse / echone
after his degree. The other ladyes and damoyselles the
whiche was there without nombre / put theym in theyr
places / and scaffoldes that were for thē ordeyned / and
ensygned. And in lyke wyse on the other syde was a grete
company of noble and valyaunt knyghtes and lordes

of this realme of Englande. Ye may well thynke that it
was grete tryumphe and grete solace for the men of armes / 
for to beholde so fayre a companye aboute the noble / 
and excellent Helayne / and euery thynge so well ordeyned
as that thynge was there / for her sake / the whiche
was so rychely apparaylled that non

the lyght that the precyous stones rendred that were
about
                  •
                her / the whiche embelysshed her excellent vysage.
Who that hadde sene her in that estate / he wolde haue
thought that she hadde ben a thyng of the other worlde / 
for I thynke that at her nayssaūce and byrthe / nature
had put all her excellence / and grace. Yf that she was
semely of body / and excellent of vysage / it was nothynge
in comparyson towarde the gyftes of grace / where
with she was endowed / for all excellence / and bounte / 
honoure / & hūblenesse / doulsure / and swetnesse / and all
other vertues and good condycyons that in ony womā
of noble lygnage apperteyned / florysshed in her. And
therfore she sholde be ryght eurous in this wretched
worlde that myght attayne vnto so hyghe a thynge as
for to haue for his parte ye floure and lyesse of this worlde.
And euen thus euery body put hymselfe in payne for
to conquere her. And there was not one but that hym semed
that he wolde conquere her / or elles deye in the payne.

               ANd then the ladyes were not soo sone in the
scaffoldes / but that the four hondred knyghtes
were vpon ye felde / redy for to withstande
all comers / as ye haue herde before / for
the torneyment sholde last thre dayes. The
fyrst daye was ordeyned for to Iust. The seconde daye
for to torneye / not as they do nowe a dayes / but with
sharpe swerdes / and not rebatred. The thyrde day was
for to fyght on fote / and euery body myght haue an axe
of armes / and a swerde aboute hym. And bycause that
they were many knyghtes / they had grete place / they wt 
               
out had knowlege that they of within were alredy at the
lystes vpon the felde / and all the ladyes redy for to beholde
them whiche sholde do best / euery knyght put hym in
deuoyre for to Iuste the fyrste. Neuerthelesse Olyuer
was not the fyrste / for there was many there afore hym
As the kynges sone of Scotlande / and dyuers kynges
of Irlonde / and many other prynces / and grete lordes / 
the whiche were so manerly clothed / that it was tryumphe
for beholde them. There was but fewe speres broken
afore Olyuers comynge. And whan he was amonge
the prece he smote his hors with the sporres / and made
his hors to torne soo gentylly / that euery body loked
vpon hym. And in especyall it pleased the ladyes moche
his fyrst entrynge in / sayng that the blacke knyght was
best in poynt / and the fayrest armed of all the place / and
after began the Iustes / and euery body put hym in payne
for to do well. The knyght that was Olyuers gouernour
sayd vnto hym / my frende beholde vpon this scaffolde
the fayre lady that ye shall conquere / yf that it holde
not at you / take good courage / and thynke for to doo
well. And then he toke a spere and gaue it to Olyuer y•
whiche toke of it no regarde / for he had fyxed his syghte
vpon the excellent Helayne. And soo he hadde his spere
in the rest a grete whyle / without ony mouynge from
one place / as he that that thought nothȳge on it. And so
as the knyght behelde hym in that estate / he sayd vnto
hym Olyuer he slepe. And thenne Olyuer as a persone
that is awaked out of his slepe / smote his hors with the
sporres without auysynge where he wente / and ye fyrste
thynge that he recountred with his spere / that was ionge
and stronge meruaylously / was a post that helde vp
a scaffolde / and vpon that scaffolde was moche people / 

and he smote it downe / and all them that were vpon it.
Then there was grete laughter of them that sawe it / &
sayd that it was a meruayllous stroke. The ladyes excused
hym / saynge that he had not clere syghte / or that
his hors was not at his wyll. Olyuer was ledde backe
to his felowes sore ashamed / and they gaue hȳ a newe
spere. The fyrst that he encountred with was one of the
kynges of Irlande / named Maquemor / y• whiche was
smyten downe horse and all. Then ye sholde haue herde
the heraudes crye / see the auēturous knyght armed in
blacke / that with one onely stroke hathe smyten downe
a .C. persones / & with the seconde stroke a kynge / ye shal
se hȳ do meruaylles of armes to daye. Olyuer herd the
se wordes / wherfore he put hymselfe in payne for to doo
well. And there was none that myght abyde hym a stroke
with a spere. Neuerthelesse euery body put hymself
in deuoyre as wel within as without / but aboue all Olyuer
bare y• pryce / the whiche dyde not dysplease y• fayre
Helayne / yt sayd to herselfe / that and he were as knyghtly
vnarmed / as he was armed / that he myght be ye floure
of all them in the place.

the kynge and his doughter Helayne retorned
in to the cyte. And then the Iusters departed
for that nyght. And the moost parte of the knyghtes

for to se hym dysarmed / for to knowe yf he were as semely

no pryse sholde not be gyuen vnto the last daye. And
whan it came to the daunces / and that Olyuer was not
there / euery body meruaylled / so eche dyde the best that
he coude. Olyuer was in the hermytage by the coūsayll
of his knyght / the whiche was departed from hym / and
he had tolde hym that without doubte he wolde retorne
vnto hym in the mornynge betymes / wherfore Olyuer
thanked hym / and abode in the hermytage that nyght / 
in thankynge our lorde of his good auenture. The good
hermyte made hym Ioyefull chere to his power / but he
made not soo good chere as they dyde at London. The
noble Helayne was set in the halle / in ye same wyse that
she was sette at the Iustes / to the ende that euery body
myght beholde her. After that the daunces were ended
they brought spyees. And after the fayre Helayne was
conueyed to her chambre / with foyson of ladyes / and so
the feest ended for that daye. Nowe ye oughte to vnderstande
that euery persone made hym y• best at case that

ryde was a bayarde. And the horse was hosed in clothe

               ANd then Olyuer came to the torneymente
and was the fyrst that entred in to the felde
of them of without / but ye may well thyuke
that it was not without grete beholdynge
of the ladyes / and in lyke wyse of theym
of within / ye may well thynke that Olyuer thus accompanyed
as ye haue herde / was beholden of kynges and
quenes / lordes and ladyes / and of all them that were there
presente / and he the whiche knewe it / the beste wyse y•
he myght made hym lyghtest for to be armed / for to gyue

the hors vpon the whiche he ought for to werke as he
haddened
                  •
                therof. He mounted vpon a lytell hors that
was ryght well accustomed for to make some pleasaunt
thynge before the ladyes / and therfore he faylled not at
that tyme / wherfore the sayd Olyuer was beholden of
euery body / and sayd the one to the other / beholde what
a semely knyght he is / for by symylytude of his body he
ought well for to encheue a hye enterpryse / se how honestly
and knyghtly he rydeth / for he remeueth noo moore
for all that his horse can do / than yf he were not vpō his

came ryght rychely clothed / and strongly accompanyed

and whan he hadde remembraunce / or leyser to loke
on hye / and that he myghte beholde the fayre Helayne / 
his force & hardynesse doubled. Wherfore none may recounte
the valyauntnes & feates of armes that he dydde / 
Now it was ordeyned that & the sygne of them of within
myght by force of armes be broughte to a place that
was there / by theyr aduersary party / that the torneyng
sholde be accomplysshed. Therfore they of without put
themselfe in payn for to wynne it. And Olyuer the whiche
rested neuer in one place / and to whome euery body
made waye / encountred hym that bare the sygne of thē

make redy y• feest / for the example that the rede knyght
had gyuen them the daye afore / the whiche all redy dyd
arme hym / & was comen vpon his hors clothed in whyte
and all his folke in the same sute / in the same manere

that they came the daye afore / saue that they had ben clothed
in rede / and soo came in to the felde on horsbacke / &
put hemselfe besyde the kynges sone of Scotlande / and
all the other alyght in lyke wyse. And then whan all were
assembled / the kynge badde two knyghtes for to goo
loke how many they were of without. Then they wente
downe / and tolde the Lordes the kynges wyll and commaundement.
Then they toke a gyrdell and made them
for to passe vnderneth / and founde that they of without
were well foure hondred. And a knyght by the commaū
               dement
of the kynge sayd that euery body sholde vngyrde
his swerde / and sayd that the axe suffysed / and after
that the batayll was begonne / the Kynge sente men for
to departe them / and badde that none were so hardy for
to smyte on the heed with the trenchaūt after y• tyme / &
aduertysed them yt the pryce sholde be gyuen at nyght / 
to hym that hathe deserued it. And thenne it was tolde
them that they myght begynne whan it sholde seme thē
good. Then they begāne for to smyte in suche wyse that
it was a goodly syght to beholde them. It was a semely
syght for to beholde howe Olyuer demeaned hym with
his axe / for he smote so puyssauntly that he made hym
awaye large ynoughe. Whan they approched nere the
one smote vpon ye other so impetyously that it was meruayll
they myght stande. Olyuer dremed not / for he gaue
so pesaunt strokes / that hym that he hytte a ryght he
made hym to kysse the grounde / and he dyde soo moche
that there durst not abyde afore hym / soo with force of
smy
                  •
               ynge / his axe that was grete and longe dyde breke
And whan he sawe that / he approched hym to a knyght
and pulled his axe out of his handes / by suche a myght
and by suche a chyualrous puyssaunce / vertue and also

manere that whether he wolde or not he made hym kysse
the grounde. Twayne of the kynges of Irlande / had
grete enuye at Olyuer / bycause they sawe the pryce coude
not escape hym / & therfore by grete dyspleasure they
assaylled Olyuer / the whiche defended hym so valyauntly / 
that he cloue one of them to the tethe. The kȳge seynge
that it myght not endure without grete debate / sayd
that it suffysed. And so they departed whether they wolde
or not.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer was taken by the knyghtes that the
kynge had cōmysed / and how his seruauntes vanysshed
awaye / and after how he founde foyson of moneye / 
and vestymentes. Capitulo. xxix.
            
               
            
            
               
               ANd then the kynge and the ladyes retorned
in to the cyte / & euery body withdrewe thē
in to theyr habytacyons / so the deed kȳges
body was borne in to London by his men / 
where as his body was enseuelyd / and put
in a hors lyttere couered with blacke / and in that estate / 
in grete lamentacyons was ledde in to his realme. Olyuer
was yet in the felde where as he cryed after his hors
but none answered hȳ / nor he coude espye none of them
that came with hym / wherof he had grete meruayl / and
was so dyspleasaunt that he wyst not what to do / not wt
standynge his armour / he put hym selfe on the waye towarde
the hermytage all ashamed / saynge that he sawe
well his euyll au
                  •
               nture / and that in all fortune was to
hym contrarye. And therfore he delybered in hym selfe
for to habandonne the good that myght come to hym by
occasyon of the torneyment / and not for to make hym to
be knowen to ony persone lyuynge. Euen so as he wente
thynkynge on his euyll aduenture / the .xx. knyghtes
that by the kynge were commysed / and ordeyned for to
haue regarde on hym / soughte hym on euery syde / and
dyde soo moche that they apperceyued hȳ goynge alone
Then they smote theyr horses with the sportes / and dyd
so moche that they ouertoke hym / and sayd to hym. Gē
               tyll
knyght lette it not torne you to dyspleasure / yf that
we
                  •
                do that the whiche was cōmaunded vs by the kynge
for he hathe cōmaunded vs for to witholde you / y• whiche
requyreth you / that it wyll please you / for to be this
nyght at the daunces / and at the banquet / and therfore
by hym we laye handes on you. It was force to Olyuer
to obeye the commaundement of the kynge. And therfore
all ashamed he retorned to London with the forsayd

knyghtes. But durynge the waye it was not withoute
plesaūt thoughtes / for whan he bethoughte hym of the
grete pompes / and ryche habyllementes that he had durynge
the other dayes / and now he founde hym alone wt 
out ony knowlege / and that it was force for hym to be
at ye banket and feest with the other / without gowne / or
other clothynge / saue in his harneys / but yf he foūde some
that wolde lenne hym a gowne / he was in soo grete
dyspleasaūce / that he wolde haue ben a .M. myle thens
yf it hadde ben possyble for hym. In that estate they rode
tyll they came to London / and dyslodged one of the
xx. knyghtes for to lodge hym / and demaunded hym in
what place they wolde fynde his seruauntes / for to sende
for them. The poore Olyuer all ashamed sayd. Certaynlye
I can not tell you where to fynde theym / but
for this nyghte I shall be mayster / and varlet. As they
were in these deuyses the hostesse came to Olyuers persone
and sayd to hym alowe. My lorde it is not longe ago
syth one of your seruauntes was here / and gaue me
this lytell fardell / tellynge me that your clothes were in
it / and hathe layde the bogette vnder your beddes heed
For all your seruauntes ben gone / and ye shall fynde thē
nomore. And tolde me that the knyght that ye wote of / 
recommaundeth hym to you / and putteth you in memorye
of the promyse yt ye made to hym / the whiche prayth
you that ye wyll haue it in remembraunce Olyuer herȳ
               ge
his hostesse / was more abasshed than euer he had ben
and feynynge that he knewe well ynoughe what it wolde
meane / wente fyrst to his beddes heed / and founde ye
bogette that his hostesse hadde tolde hym of / and founde
the keye in the locke / and tasted it / and felte wel ynough
that it was heuy / and vndyde it / and in lokynge in to it

he apperceyued that it was nothynge but golde / & good
nobles of Englande.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer founde grete fynaunce
                  •
                / seruauntes
and clothynges / and how he was broughte in to the
Kynges courte with grete reuerence of the knyghtes
that had taken hym. Capitulo. xxx.
            
               
            
            
               
               OLyuer that foūde hymselfe all alone in his
chābre / sat hym downe / for the .xx. knyghtes
hadde taken leue of hym / and were gone
for to dysarme them / to be at the feest / &
seynge that he had tyme ynoughe / begāne
for to tell his moneye / and founde that there was .v. M.
nobles / wherfore he thanked god and the noble knyght
that had / had soo good remembraunce on hym. Whyles
that he put vp his golde in to his bougette / entred in to
ye chambre fyue gentyll squyers clothed in whyte satyn
& .x. varlets clothed in whyte clothe / whiche salued hym
saynge. My lorde / your mayster stewarde hathe ben here
this after none / and hathe gyuen eche of vs a gowne
and tolde vs that it was your lyueray / and that ye shold
reteyne vs in your seruyce / and therfore we come towarde
you to knowe and it be y
                  •
               ur wyll / for there is none of
vs but that he hathe good mayster / for some be the Erle
of Flaundres men / and the other the dukes of Somerset
And thus eche of vs hath good maysters / but they haue
as many seruauntes as theym nede the. And for the
valyaūtnesse that we haue sene in you / we become your
seruaūtes yf it be your pleasure. Olyuer answered thē
and sayd. My frendes of your grace ye saye more good
of me than I haue deserued. Ans as I vnderstāde eche
of you hathe a good mayster / and better than I am / but
and it be your wyll I reteyne you all. And to morowe
syth that ye be men of knowlege I shall enquere of your
estate / and thenne to eche of you I shall gyue suche estate
as to you apperteyneth. One of y• seruauntes sayd to
hym. My lorde your mayster stewarde hathe ordeyned
me your palfreynere / therfore ye shall tell me yf it please
you what I shall do with your horses. For I haue fyue

good coursers / & two lytell hobyes ryght fayre / of whiche
he badde me take good heede. And bycause that it is
ferre to the courte I thynke ye wyll not g
                  •
                on fote therfore
yf it please you ye shal tell me whiche of your horses
ye wyll haue / and what harneys I shall put vpon hym
whether that of veluet crymosyn / or that of beten golde
& yf that it please you that your four pages shall come
towarde you. Olyuer was moche abasshed / and made
the sygne of the crosse / and sayd to hym. My frende go in
goddes name / & sadle one of the two lytell hobyes whiche
thou louest best / and put on hym the harnes of beten
golde / and make ye pages come with two torches for to
lyght me in to the courte. And thē Olyuer commaūded
for to vndo the fardell / and so it was done. And founde
thre sortes of clotynge for hym / of the same colours yt he
hadde worne durynge the torneyment / that is to wyte / 
blacke / rede / and whyte. The hosen were of scarlet / the
gownes of veluet / the doublettes of blacke damaske fygured / 
and the hatte of blacke / vpon the whiche was a
ryght gentyll and ryche ouche of stones ryght curyously
wrought / & there was in it an e / & an o / togyder. Wherfore
he began for to kysse it / and sayd alowe. Fayre fader
god yf that thou wylte extende soo moche thy grace on
me / that my fortune were suche that Olyuer & Helayn
myght come so nere togyder as these two lettres / I sholde
be moche beholden to thanke thy grete maieste. In y•
same wordes Olyuer clothed hym / and founde that his
clothynge were so well made for hym / that there coude
none amende them. He was not so sone clothed but that
his hors was redy abydynge hym at the dore / and his
foure pages. And within shorte tyme after y• knyghtes
that had brought hym theder / came for to fetche hym / 

and tolde hym that it was hyghe tyme to goo in to the
courte. They they mounted on horsbacke / and the torches
were lyghted that conduyted them in to y• courte.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer came in to the courte of the ryght noble
kynge of Englande / where as he was receyued of
all y• lordes / and l
                  •
               dyes wt grete Ioye. Ca. xxxi.
            
               
            
            
               
               WHā Olyuer was afore the gate of y• palays
he began for to smyte his hors with y• sporres / 
y• whiche made lepes without nōbre
& dyde all that his mayster wolde haue hȳ
do / he made fyre to sprynge out of the payment
in suche haboundaunce yt euery body loked out at
ye wyndowes to beholde hym / & in suche estate he came
to the place where it was tyme to alyght. And bycause y•
he was so semely a knyght / there was grete prece to be
holde hym. There was so huge a nombre of folke that
with grete payne he myghte descende / and passe forthe / 
The tydynges came to the kynge / and to the other prȳ
               ces
that theder were comen / how y• whyte knyght was
comen / and mounted vp the steyres / and sayd that and
his beaute were lost / that in all the worlde it myghte not
be recouered / and in lyke wyse these tydynges were pronounced
to the ladyes / the whiche demaunded what maner
a man he was / and it was tolde them that he was
a heed of werke / & that there was neuer sene a more fayrer
knyght. And durynge these wordes he entred in to y•
halle where as all the lordes were / and salued the kȳge
The whiche by semblaunt made hym ryght grete chere
and honour / and so dyde all the other lordes / the whiche
sholdred one another for to se hym / for his excellente be
aute. There was many that at his comynge wolde that
he hadde ben a thousande myle thens / and in especyall
they that hadde done beste nexte hym dyde curse hym in
theyr courage / but his physnamye and maneres were
so swete / that he sholde haue ben ryghte cursed y• wolde
haue done hym ony harme. So as he was fested on euery
syde / ye ryght fayr and good Helayne accompanyed
with dyuers grete lordes and ladyes came in to the hall

apparaylled & aourned so rychely / that her habyllementes
were worthe a realme / for there was neuer sene the
pareylles or lyke. Her beaute enlumyned the palays / the
whiche exceded all natures werke. And thynke not that
that Helayne for whome Troye receyued soo many aduersytes
passed this. But bycause that comparysons be
heynous / and noysous I holde my peas in retornynge
to my purpose. The fayre Helayne of Englande seynge
the thought of her lorde and fader set her vpon her knees / 
and made to hym reuerence and honoure as it apperteyned.
The kynge her fader toke her by the hande and
made her for to aryse / in saynge that she was ryght well
come. And thenne she was salued of all the other k
                  •
               yghtes
& lordes vnto whome she rendred echone theyr salute
after theyr qualyte / as she coude do full well. Thenne
was Olyuer brought afore her the whiche knewe hym
as sone as she sawe hym. For he was easy for to knowe
amongest them all. Wherfore she behelde hym voluntarylye / 
and it was force to the knyghtes and squyres for
to withdrawe them aparte / for to make place to the lad
                  •
               es
and gentylwomen / to the ende that they myght se
hym the better at theyr cases. And there was but fewe
of them that were for to marye / but that they thoughte
within theymselfe / and wolde that Olyuer had conquered
them by force of armes / as well as he hadde done y•
fayre Helayne.

the tables were spredde / and incontynente
as all thynge was redy y• trompettes blewe
for water to wasshe theyr handes. And then
the kȳge and his doughter wasshed / and all
the other lordes in generall. And the Kynge made to enquere
of Olyuer / of his kȳne / and what he was / and of
what marches / to the ende that y• honour were done to
hym after his estate. He answered to them that demaunded
hym that he was a poore knyght of Spayne / & not
of a hye place. There was not one neyther the kyng nor
the other / but that men semed well by his phys
                  •
               amye / 
that he was of a good house / and that also without grete

Whan tyme was the kynge satte hym downe at the table / 

and with hym all the grete lordes and ladyes / reserued
Helayne / that was sette vp on hye in the myddes of
a table that was eleuate / to the ende that she myght be sene
of all theym in the halle. At the ryght syde were the
prynces Iuges set at the same table / and on the other syde
were the .x. pryncesses at the same table. Olyuer wolde
not sytten downe at the kynges stable. Notwithstandynge
he was prayed so moche / and commaunded that
it was force for hym to obeye. There was other tables
without nombre where as the other knyghtes and ladyes
were sette. Who that wolde deuyse to you the seruyce
and the mysteryes that was there / it sholde be to longe
to recoūte it. There was no mete that replenysshed thē
so sone / as to beholde the excellent Helayne / she was the
repose of the wery / and the couragynge of the valyaunt
And there was not one but that they thought that god
hadde made her for to shewe his hyghe puyssaūce. This
feest dured so longe tyll that it was tyme to vnserue / &
there was none of them all that thought other thynge / 
saue to make good chere / and also they were not requyred
otherwyse. The tables taken awaye & graces gyuē
to our lorde of his goodnes / the daunces began / and incontynent
the .x. prynces / and the .x. pryncesses withdrewe
them a parte in to a lytel chambre for to knowe who
had done best / and they were in grete plete. The one helde
with the kynges sone of Scotlande / and the other 
                  〈◊〉
               
the erle of Flaundres / & the other with the good duke of
Somerset. But the moost parte helde with Olyuer. In
suche wyse that there was none of theym but that they
gaue theyr voyce to Olyuer / & whan the kynge thought
that they myght well haue done / he habandonned the
daunces and came towarde them / & demaunded theym

what thynge that they had done. One of theym kneled
downe & sayd. Our souerayne lorde ye haue of your gode

                  •
               e afore. Olyuer had alwaye doubte of y•
thynge / by cause of the grete multytude of lordes that
were there / to whome hȳ thought they wolde soner applye
than to hym / & thought as well that yf he were not
contente that it sholde be force to hym / wherfore he answered
to the prynce. My lorde ye mocke with me for I

               
haue not deserued the honour that ye do to me / but and
ye speke in sadnesse / and that it please the kynge to make
to me a request / as I here you saye. I tell you that it
is no prayer / but his commaundement to the whiche I
wyll not dysobeye / and sayd no more / nor the lorde also
but retorned towarde the kȳge / and aduertysed hym of
that whiche he hadde founden in Olyuer / and sayd that
he founde neuer a more dyscreter mā / nor more worthy
and that he was dygne of moche good. And the Kynge
was ryght Ioyous of that reporte / and began for to tell
in what maner he wolde that ye pryce were gyuen / and
who sholde bere it / and tolde them that he wolde make
them haue knowlege / the houre that the pryce sholde he

where as he founde his doughter / y• whiche he toke by

thā to an other. Ye be my fader reason it is that I obey
to you / for your pleasure is myne / and also me thȳketh
that they haue all done so well that none can amende it / 
Then the kynge demaunded her yf that she wolde be as
well cōtente yf Olyuer hadde the pryce / as yf a gretter
lorde had it. She answered / it is a fayre thȳge to do ryghte
to euery body. Ye be wyse and knoweth what ye haue

y• whiche was brought in the maner that foloweth.
         
         
            ¶How the pryce of the torneyment was brought to
Olyuer by dyuers lordes and ladyes / and what it

               THere came fyrste many torches / and offycers

                on hyghe with
bothe his hādes a grete and massysse cheyne
of golde / charged & enryched with precyous
stones. After hym came two fayre ladyes / clothed in lyke
habyllementes / the whiche became them so well that
it was a pleasaūt syght to beholde them. These ladyes
were accompanyed with four knyghtes clothed in lyke
wyse / and eche of the ladyes were on the ryght hande of
two knyghtes. And in suche estate they came afore y• kȳ
               ges

And thē they demaunded hym yf it were his
good pleasure that the pryce were gyuen. And he answered
ye. Then they began to walke aboute the halle / and
came to the place where as Olyuer was hydde amonge
the prece. To whome the Kynge of armes sayd that he
sholde come forth / and that it was to hym that they wolde
speke / and after that he was comen forth the kynge of
armes sayd to hym in this wyse. Carbūcle and gemme
of all prowesse and hardynesse / the kȳge our souerayne

For she shall be appareylled for you / euen as she sholde
be at this presente tyme / for he wolde not take fro you
for no thynge / that the whiche ye haue deserued. Oliuer
with a symple voyce all rubycūde answered that he had
not deserued the honour that they presented hym / but
syth that it was the kynges good pleasure / and the lordes
and ladyes / he sholde be a grete fole / and mysproude
to refuse it. As for the surplus touchynge the kynges
requestes / he answered that his requestes were cōmaū
               dementes / 
in praynge yf that he had wonne ony thynge
that it sholde not be taken from hym. For he was well
in wyll for to take it / yf it fell to hym. This notwithstandynge
he was well contente that the kynges wyll were
accomplysshed / and to abyde a yere. And thanked the
kynge / and the ladyes that had made hym that present.
And toke the chayne of golde and put it aboute his neck
And then they demaūded hym his name / and surname
he made hymself Olyuer / but he sayd that his surname
myght not be knowen at that present tyme. And bycause
that the heraude coude not tell how to gyue his name
in knowlege that the pryce was gyuen to / he beganne
for to crye in this maner wyse To this blacke / rede / and

            THen was Olyuer ledde afore the kȳge / y• whiche
he thanked hūbly of the grete honour that

he had done to hym without deseruynge / and besought
hym for to haue alwaye memorye of hym / and of his promyse
that he h

               o made hym / and to reteyne hym of his

it with ryght
                  •
                good wyll / & that suche estate as he wolde
demaunde / sholde be delyuered hym / and with that
that he sholde not fere hym / but that he wolde haue me
morye of hym / & that bycause of the pryce that was his
he sholde lese nothynge. Syr sayd Olyuer I can not tel
you how ye vnderstande it / truely I can nothynge lese / 
of what wherof I had neuer nothynge / but I holde you
for so valyaunt that ye wyll not go agaynst your worde
ye gyue me for to chese and take suche estate as shal please
me / wherfore I thanke you. ¶And therfore I praye
you that ye wyll be cōtente that I be squyre keruer afore
my lady your doughter. And the Kynge answered in
refusynge hym / and sayd that his doughter was not accustomed
for to be serued of a knyght. Notwithstandynge
he requyred and prayed so moche that the kynge was
cōtente that his wyll were fulfylled. Neuerthelesse that
he was worthy to haue had a gretter estate than that / 
Then he made hym to ryse and toke hym by the hāde / &
ledde hym towarde his doughter / and then commaunded
her that she sholde kysse hym / bycause that hym semed
that Olyuer had well deserued it / and at the leest
yf that he had no more honour but that for to content hȳ
the better. The fayre Helayne in accomplysshynge the
wyll of the Kynge her fader / toke Olyuer by y• hande y•
was alredy on his knee / and kyssed hym in touchȳge her
mouthe agaynst his. This kysse thrugh perced y• herte
of Olyuer and his entraylles / and entred and lodged in
the moost secretest place of his herte / and neuer after departed / 

that done she made Olyuer to aryse / the whiche
thanked her. After the daunces were begonne agayne / 
and endured a grete space of tyme / and after came the
wyne and spyces / and whā euery body had dronke and
that it was oure for to go to bedde / the grete prynces / &
lordes toke leue of the kynge / and of the fayre Helayne / 
for to retorne on the morowe in to theyr countrees / and
thanked the kynge of the grete chere and honour that he
had done to them in his courte. The kynge prayed hym
that they wolde yet abyde a daye or twayne. But they
wolde not abyde but badde hym adew. And whan it came
that the kynges sone of Scotlande toke his leue of ye
fayre Helayne / he sayd to her alowe as in reprochynge / y•
he was ryght Ioyous that she was soo well assygned.
Helayne that was not folysshe / vnderstode well that all
that he hadde sayd / proceded of enuye / wherfore she helde
her styll and sayd nothynge / but toke leue of hym & of
all the other / the whiche wente in to theyr lodgynges &
on the morowe departed. The kynge Maquemor of Irlande / 
and another that was his neyghbour for ony prayer
that the kynge dyde make / wolde not come to y• feest
but all euyll contente were departed / without takynge
leue / for the dyspleasure that they had of the dethe of the
kynge of Irlande theyr frende / and that the kynge had
made therof so lytell accounte. And affermed & promysed
the one to the other that yf it were possyble for them
whan they were comen in to theyr countree / that the kynge
of Englande sholde repente hym to late.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer was reteyned of the Kynges courte

               OLyuer badde good nyght to the kynge and
to his fayre doughter Helayne / and consequentlye
to all the other. And he was conueyed
to his lodges / by dyuers gentylmen
of the kynges courte / that all redy had grete
volente for to be acquaynted with hȳ. Olyuer comen
in to his lodges / made theym for to drynke / and then he
thanked them for y• trauayll y• they had taken for hym / &
sayd to them. My lordes I wyll be from hensforth your
seruaunt / broder / and felowe. And yf there be ony thynge
that I may do for you / there is none of you but that
ye shall fynde me redy at nede. Then they all departed / 

saue one gentyll squyre / the whiche Olyuer reteyned wt 
hym / for to lye with hym / & also to the ende that he sholde
haue the more acquayntaunce with the lordes of the
courte. The nyght passed and the daye came. And whā
it was tyme. Olyuer arose and clothed hym in newe robes / 
that he had made make all the nyght. And was led
to the courte by his squyre / and foūde the kynge y• was
alredy at the masse / the whiche fynysshed / the kynge cō
               maunded
that Olyuer sholde be ledde towarde his fyrst
knyght chamberlayne / the whiche he had ordeyned for
to speke to hym. Whā Olyuer was comen / y• fyrst chamberlayne
sayd to hym Olyuer my frende the kyng hath
ordeyned me for to receyue your othe / and that I gyue
to you retynue of .xx. horses. And yf it be your pleasure
for to serue my lady his doughter as ye haue requyred / 
as well ye may do it / as yf ye were of lesse estate. Olyuer
thanked the kynge / and made his othe. And as he y• whiche
thoughte neuer tyme ynoughe for to se her that had
gyuen hym that gracyous kysse / requyred that for that
daye he myght kerue afore her / and so he was ledde into
her chambre / where as Helayns table was spredde / the
whiche made no longe taryenge but came. Whan Olyuer
sawe her / he gaue her good morowe / And she rendred
hym his salute ryghte curteysly / and behelde hym
gladly. And then she sat her downe at the table. Where
as Olyuer began for to kerue afore her. And in castynge
vp her eyen demaunded hym yf that it was his wyl for
to kerue afore her. Olyuer answered / madame it is my
pleasure for to do you all the seruyce that I can / so that
it torne you not to dyspleasure. Olyuer my frende sayd
she nay / but I thanke you / how well y• I had wolde that
ye had deported you of this offyce / but syth yt it is youre

wyll / it is well myne. So Olyuer kerued afore his fayr
maystres all alonge the dyner / but it was not withoute
foyson of regardes and lokes. Whan the table was vp / 
he was a lytell whyle with the ladyes / and then he wente
towarde the kynge / to whome they had tolde that Olyuer
dyde serue at his doughters dyner / & sayd that he
was the gentyllest seruaunt that euer they had sene.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer was surprysed of the loue of Helayne
and cutte his fyngre in seruynge her. Ca. xxxvii.
            
               THese thynges dyde passe / and Olyuer was a
grete whyle in ye courte so well beloued that
all that knewe hȳ sayd good of hym. The kȳ
               ge
hymselfe coude not prayse hym ynoughe / 
& sayd often that Olyuer was bothe fayre &
good / saynge that he and his doughter were wel serued
The fayre Helayne in lyke wyse seynge the graces and
beautees that god and nature had endowed that yonge
knyght with / dyde prayse hym strongly in her herte / but
she made no semblaunt for doubte of some folke. For ye
knowe well ynoughe that they say oftener the euyll than
the good / for all that whā they demaunded her / she sayd
that she sawe nothynge in hȳ but all good / and that he
was a ryght gracyous knyght / & in suche estate he had
put hym in the grace of all them that knewe hym. And
in lyke wyse at y• begynnynge had ben cōspyred dyuers
enuyes agaynst his persone / but by the grete wysdome
& doulcenesse that remayned in hym / he had subdued &
ouercome his euyl wyllers / in suche wyse that euery body

loued hym. Also none can not recorde to you y• newe
thynges that were begonne / enterprysed / and acheued
by hȳ / as well Iustynge as other dyspertes and playes
Ye haue well herde how Olyuer had receyued a kysse of
his excellent maystresse / and I haue also tolde you that
he kepte it so well / that he lost it not whan he wolde / for
loue in a shorte space had defaced his Ioye and lyesse / &
with that helde hym so streyte in his bondes that he coude
not ete nor drynke / slepe nor rest in bedde / and he was
not at his ease nor peas the houre that he hadde lost the
syght of his lady and maystresse. And was not in no place
but that hym thought that he sawe the representacyō
of his excellente lady afore his eyen. In suche estate he
was a space of tyme / and in suche wyse he aduychylled / 
hym that he became in suche estate that he cared no more
of noo good dede. Thystorye sayth that on a tyme as
he kerued afore his maystres at the table as he that was
not mayster ouer hymselfe began to beholde her / and in
beholdynge her he made many syghes of loue that proceded
from his herte. Then the fayre Helayne apperceyued
that he thought strongely vpon her / and she had no
thȳge kerued afore her for to ete. For Olyuer had gyuē
her none / wherfore she sayd by dyuers tymes. Olyuer
my frende I wolde ete gladly yf ye gaue me wherof Olyuer
that thought on other thynges herde her not at y•
fyrst tyme. And whan his vnderstandynge was comen
agayn / all ashamed he began for to serue / and as he that
had no thought on that whiche he dyde / cut his fyngre

                  •
               ll moost of. Wherfore he departed from thens incontynent / 
and gaue another to serue. Helayne apperceyuynge
these thȳges knewe & apperceyued clerely y• thought
of Olyuer / wherof she was nothynge gladde / whan she

sawe hym in suche poynt for her loue.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer layde hym downe in his bedde soore
syke / and how that Helayne was syke also for hym / &
of theyr complayntes / and how Helayne gate leue of
her fader go to vysyte Olyuer. Capitulo. xxxviii.
            
               
            
            OLyuer comē in to his lodgys entred all alone in
to his chambre / and layde hym downe vpon his

bedde / in complaynynge hym so pyteously / that it was
grete pyte for to here. He cursed the god of loue that had
wounded hym so profoundly with his hambynge darte
and bounde hym in his bandes soo vyolently / wherfore
he sawe appertely that he must nedes deye / for he abode
none allegeaunce / nor mercye of his anguysshous maladye.
Ha kynge of Englāde sayd Olyuer yf thy worde
had ben verytable / as a kynges ought to be / I had not
fallen in this extremyte that I am nowe in. Thus as ye
haue herde demeaned Olyuer his sorowe by longe space
of tyme / and contynued so in that he was greuously
sycke / and layde hym downe in his naked bedde. Wherof
the Kynge and all they of the courte were ryghte dyspleasaunt.
And the kynge vysyted hym ryght famylyerly / 
and made hym to be sumptuously kepte / and taken
heede to of his physycyons. But aboue all them that were
dolaunt / the noble Helayne passed / notwithstādynge
she made no semblaunt outwarde. And on a tyme as y•
physycyens came to her / as it is theyr custome for to vysyte
prynces and prencesses / she demaunded them how
Olyuer dyde / and yf that he amended not. They answered
naye / and sayd that they had grete doubte of his lyfe
Whan Helayne herde these tydynges she was so dolent
that she myght scarsely susteyne herselfe. Thē she with
drewe her in to her garderobe / and gaue them to vnderstande
that she was sycke / & therfore she layde her downe
on her bedde / & made her to be couered / for to couer
the better her dole. And whan the ladyes were voyded / 
she began to saye with a softe voyce. O god almyghtye
creatour of heuen and erthe / the whiche after thy pleasure
dysposeth all erthely thynges. And thou ryght doulce
quene of heuen / lady of the worlde / and empresse of helle

also truely as thou bare .ix. monthes in thy blessyd flankes
the veray sone of god thyn espouse / and that conceyued
hym a vyrgyn / and delyuered hym a vyrgyn / and y•
arte aduocate and refuge of all desolate creatures I beseche
the that thou wylte counsayll me vnhappy and vnfortuned
woman. O gloryous vyrgyn Marye wherfore
hathe thy blessyd sone gyuen me soo moche beaute for to
be cause of the dethe of the moost fayrest / and moost valyauntest
knyght that euer was sene / the whiche am in
dygne of this grace. Wherfore I beseche the that thou
kepe this gentyll knyght / the whiche hathe not my soone
me in no maner of the worlde / wherby I sholde put
hym in this ryght daungerous peryll / and that thou dysdeyne
not for to tell me myn honour saued / how that I
myght gyue hym allegeaunce of his maladye. Whyles
that she complayned so to god and to our lady / a lyghte
sompne toke her / wherthrughe she was constrayned to
slepe. In her slepe her semed that our lady spake to her
and sayd. Helayne my sone & I haue herde thy request
The knyght for whome thou hast prayed is sycke to the
dethe. And bycause that thou arte cause of his maladye / 
thou must be cause also of his guarysshȳge and helthe / 
go towarde thy fader and demaunde hym lycence for to

                  •
               o se hym / & whan thou shalte be there / put hym in memorye
that the yeres ende approcheth nere / & that thou
shalte haue so good mynde on hym / that it shall suffyse
hym. Helayne a waked ryght Ioyous of her vysyō / and
in thankynge god and our lady arose / and wente towarde
her fader / the whiche gaue her leue to go vysyte Olyuer / 
and so she wente theder with a lytell company. And
whan she was entred in to the chambre / she approched
towarde the bedde where as Olyuer was / that alredye

had lost his knowlege / and with the teres in her eyen named
hym her frende / in demaundynge hym how he dyde.
Olyuer knewe the voyce of his may

               esse / and lyfte
vp his eyen in makynge a lytell syghe anguysshous / for
other thynge coude he not answere. Helayne apperceyued
that he had but lytell knowlege / wherfore she approched
more nerer / and sayd with a lowe voyce. Alas my
frende what lacke ye / wyll ye leue me a wydowe / do ye
not knowe y• the ende of the twelue monthe approcheth
By my trouth my frende your maladye doth greue me
so sore that ye can not byleue it / wherfore I pray you
that ye wyll thynke for to guarysshe you / and yf there be
ony thynge that I can do for you / tell it me. And euē so
god helpe me myn honoure salued / I knowe no mā for
whome I wolde do more than for you.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer after that the fayre Helayne had
vysyted hym came to the courte / and of the messenger
of the Kynges of Irlande / sente to the Kynge
of Englande / for to defye hym of fyre and blode.
Capitulo. xxxix.
            AS Olyuer herde y• swete voyce of his maystres
that recomforted hym so swetely / he forced
hym for to speke / and with grete payne
thanked her / and with payne myght he absteyne
hym from saynge that she was cause
of his dethe / and as she that loued hym / sayd to hym / 
Fayre syr thynke for to waxe hole / and come to ye courte
For vpon my fayth ye shall be ryght welcome. Then she

               
toke leue of hym and retorned / and it was neuer a daye
after / but that she shente for to knowe how he dyde / and
with that she sente hym ryght largely of her wynes / and
dyde so moche that within shorte tyme he was stroūge
ynoughe for to promayne hym aboute his chambre / as
he that had had a good physycyen in his maladye. And it
was not longe after that he wente in to the courte / and
whan he felte hymselfe that he was entyerly hole / he serued
his maystres as he had done before The whiche made
hym greter chere than she was accustomed to do. In
suche wyse y• Olyuer was more beauteuous than euer
he had bē afore. Helayne that apperceyued that Olyuer
was out of daunger / put hym in remembraunce of the
regrettes and complayntes that she had made for hym
durynge his maladye / wherof Olyuer had his heed dyuers
tymes sore troubled. ¶It happened vpon a whytsontyde / 

on the whiche daye he helde open courte. And
there was the moost parte of the lordes of Englande assembled / 
euen so as he was at dyner / and his doughter
sette besyde hym / came a messanger afore the table / the
whiche began for to saye. That same god all puyssaunt / 
that gouerneth all thynges / gyue honoure and glorye &
good aduenture to the hyghe and puyssaunt prynces / &
my souerayne lordes the seuen kynges of Irlande / by
whome I am sente hether / and that he confounde the
crowne of Englande / the whiche is not worthy to be named
Kynge. Now herken tyraunt what I haue in charge
for to saye to the by the kynges of Irlande. They sende
the worde by me / and defyeth the of fyre and bloode / 
and that they wyll depose the of thy realme / as he that is
not worthy for to holde it Some of them hathe ben comen
to thy courte for to knowe more playnly thy gouernynge / 
wheras they haue apperceyued thy grete crude
lyte and tyrannye / and howe that by thy synguler and
dampnable wyll / hathe accomplysshed thy tyrannye on
colde bloode withouten ony cause reasonable / wherfore
thou arte cause of the effusyon of blode humayne / and of
the semblable crysten. And therfore take heede to that
whiche thou hast to do. For I tell the that they ben alredy
descended on thy grounde / and shall do suche Iustyce
on the as apperteyneth.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer after that the messanger hadde fynysshed
his wordes / requyred the kynge of Englande for
to gyue hym men of armes / and that he wolde goo
agaynst them / the whiche was vttred vpō hym with
a good wyll. Capitulo. xl.
            
               
               
            
            
               FYnysshed the wordes of the messanger / the
kynge enclyned his heed / and sone after lyft
it vp agayne / and began to rolle his eyen / &
to bende his browes in suche wyse that here
sembled a man extracte oute of his mynde / 
Whan the messenger sawe the kynge make suche chere / 
he wolde with a good wyll haue ben in his moders bely.
There was none that answered / for the courte at that
tyme was to troubled that it was grete meruayll to beholde
it / for all they in the halle kepte scylence / and sayd
neuer a worde. Whan the valyaunt Olyuer sawe all the

kynges of Irlande hathe unposed on you by the saynge

¶The kynge answered vnto Olyuer and sayd Olyuer
I shall counsayll me on the request that ye make to me
after dyner / and after I shall make you to knowe my
wyll. And then he commaunded that the messaunger of
the Kynges of Irlande sholde be sette to dyner. And soo
it was done. Whā the kynge was rysen from the table / 
he assembled his counsayll. And then was gyuen an answere
to the messanger that he sholde saye to his maysters
that they myght be well sure that the Kynge doubted
theym but lytell / and that he hadde good wyll for to
kepe his herytage / & that yf they myghte wynne

                that
it sholde be theyres / but by the pleasure of god it sholde
not happen so / and then they gaue some gyfte vnto the
messanger. And then the sayd messanger departed and

retorned towarde the kynges of Irlāde that alredy were
entred into the realme of Englande / to whome he tolde
the answere that he had receyued. And then y• kynge
of Englande accorded to Olyuer his request / for the grete
valyauntnesse y• he had sene hym do afore tymes. And
gaue to hym .x. thousande men of armes / the whiche comen
he toke leue of the kynge / and the kynge gaue hym
foure thousande nobles at his departynge / the whiche
Olyuer toke in good thanke. But afore that he departed
from the cyte he dystrybued it vnto the poore men of armes
that had nede therof / and more to / and he dyde soo
moche that they spake of nothynge but of his grete largesse / 
wherfore he gate the loue of euery body. And in y•
maner departed after that he had taken leue of his may
stresse / the whiche commaunded hym vnto god. And he
spedde hym so well on his Iourneye that he came with
in thre myle of his enemyes. And whan it came to theyr
knowlege they reysed vp theyr syege that they had layde
aboute a stronge place / and putte theym all vpon a
playne in fayre ordenaunce redy to abyde bataylle. Olyuer
in lyke wyse prayed and requyred all his men for to
do well / in shewynge theym that they sholde haue more
honoure without comparyson / yf ony good aduenture
happened them / than yf the kynge were there in his persone / 
and eche of them promysed to do his deuoyre. And
in that good wyll they approched so nere theyr enemyes
that they myght se them clerely / the whiche were foure
agaynst one man. But they were not men of suche chap
for the moost parte were comune men and euyll armed
at all poyntes.
         
         
            
            ¶How Olyuer after that he was departed from London
in armes came afore a towne that was besyeged

vaynquysshed them. Capitulo. xlj.
            
               
            
            
               RYght so as these two hoostes approched to
gyder / ye myght haue herde suche a noyse
that it was hydeous to here / and whan it came
to the strokes gyuynge / ye sholde haue
sene sheldes c

               ouen / and helmes & hauberkes brokē / stedes
and knyghtes smyten downe / hedes and armes cut
of / and many one pulled downe that neuer rose after. Olyuer
wente thrughe the batayll maulgre all his enemyes / 
and dyde suche dedes of armes that he made hym to

be knowen within a lytell stounde of euery body / wherfore
they fledde afore hym and made hym waye. For all
that he hytte he smote downe / none can not reherse vnto
you the meruaylous strokes that he gaue / for bothe
his frendes and his enemyes were all abasshed to beholde
them. He escryed as hye as he myght / yf the kynges
of Irlande be here I shall make them crownes. One of
the kynges of Irlande that was a valyaunt man tooke
a grete spere in his hande and came towarde Olyuer / 
Olyuer that sawe hym come pulled a spere frome hym
that was nexte hym / and smote his hors with the sporres
and mette togyder so strongly that it was not in the
horses puyssaunce to susteyne them / wherfore bothe fell
to the erthe / but the kynge neuer arose after / for Olyuer
had perced his hauberke and smyten hym to the herte / 
wherof it was grete dommage / for he was a valyaunte
man. Then ye sholde haue sene Englysshmen and Irysmen
renne to the socoure of theyr lordes and there was
slayne moche people on bothe sydes. Olyuer was on sote
amongest his enemyes where as he smote on the ryghte
hande and of the lefte hande / and dyde suche dedes
of armes that it was grete meruayll. His cuttȳge swerde
made his enemyes to flee afore hȳ. For all that maulgre
them all he mounted on his hors / and then beganne
the batayll more fyers and more aspre than it hadde ben
of all the daye afore. And in that same bataylle / Olyuer
with his propre handes toke two of the moost grettest
Kynges of Irlande. And then after that Olyuer with
grete payne perced the hoost and dyde soo moche that in
despyte of all his enemyes / he came vnto the chyef standarde
of the Irysshmen / the whiche by force of armes
he smote downe to the grounde / and with one stroke he

smote of his heed that bare the standarde / & so he deyed / 
Thenne ye sholde haue sene Irysshemen gretely abasshed
whā they sawe theyr chyfe standarde fall to y• erthe
they toke grete payne for to rere it vp agayne / but they
coude not. And fynably / by y• valyauntnesse of Olyuer
and the courage that he gaue his men the Irysshemen
were dyscomfyted / and so they fled. The chase endured
more than two myle / and there was soo many slayne y•
it was a pyteous syght for to beholde it / and euery body
saued hym that myght. And than they came by nyghte
and by dare to theyr shyppes / and in grete hast they entred
in to theyr shyppes / and sayled in to Irlande where
as they tolde theyr pyteous dyscomfyture that gaue grete
dyscomforte vnto all theym of that countree. Olyuer
made to sowne the retreyte / to the ende that none wente
ferder forthe / wherfore euery body retorned. And whan
it came to repasse by the waye where as the batayll was
done / and sawe the grete effusyō of blode / there was none
of them but that theyr hertes abhorred. And Olyuer
hymselfe had the teres in his eyen and sayd. My blessyd
creatour I praye the that by thy grete mercye thou wylte
pardon me the effusyon of blode of these crysten men.
Neuerthelesse take that Olyuer sayd these wordes / yet
he was ryght Ioyous and gladde of the vyctorye / and
gaue louynges and thankynges to almyghty god / with
a good herte. In that maner they came vnto the towne
that hadde ben assyeged afore of the Irysshemen / where
as they were receyued with grete tryumphe and Ioy
and with processyon of all the chyrches / and all the belles
were rongen at his entrynge. And they gaue Olyuer
grete gyftes / the whiche he gaue vnto his men / and
in lykewyse of all the butyn that he had wonne he wolde

haue nothynge. After he sente for the capytaynes of his
armye / and whan they were comen he sayd to them / fayre
lordes ye knowe the vyctorye that god of his grace hathe
gyuen to vs agaynst oure enemyes. And therfore it
sholde be good to sygnefye these tydynges to the Kynge
our soueraylle lorde. Wherfore I praye you that the dede
bodyes maye be nombred / to the ende that we maye
wryte to hym the more certaynlye. It was tolde hym y•
the kynge sholde haue shortlye tydynges / for it sholde be
to longe to abyde the tellynge of them. But as it semed
them they myght not fayle to wryte .xx.M. of theyr enemyes

of theyr men.

of theyr vyctorye. And of the enterpryse that Olyuer
made to go into Irlande. Capitulo. xlii.
            
               ANd whā the lettres were made by Olyuer
and by the lordes / they were gyuen vnto a
messaunger / and badde hym make all dylygence
that he coude / the whiche he dyde / and
whan he was comen to London he presented
them to the kynge / and whan the kynge hadde redde
them alowe / ye may well thynke that he was ryght Ioyous
and gladde. And therfore he made theym for to be
redde on hyghe / and whan it came to the knowlege of
them of the courte / there was none but that he thanked
god. And the Kynge commaunded that these tydynges
sholde be publysshed all aboute. And after mounted on

               
horsbacke and dyuers other lordes in his companye and
so came to the cathedrall chyrche of Poules in ye whiche
he, gaue louynges / and praysynges to oure lorde / and to
the valyaunte Olyuer. ¶I retorne here to Olyuer the
whiche assembled al the gretest of his armye / & demaunded
them yf they had ony talent to doo a good thynge / 
And they answered ye & that it sholde not holde at them
Then Olyuer sayd / my lordes frendes and felowes god
hathe gyuen vs so fayre auēture that we can neuer thanbe
hȳ ynoughe. Therfore me semeth seynge oure good

begynnynge yf that it stycke not at you we maye do yet
some good thynge. For ye ought for to knowe that there
was neuer men more abasshed than our enemyes were
whan they knewe the veryte how it wente / that one of
theyr kynges was slayne / and the other twayne taken / 
and with this all theyr men of warre slayne / in whome
they affyed them. And thus thē as me semeth seynge y•
we be not ferre from theyr marches / yf that we put vs
in to theyr countree hastely / afore that theyr grete anguysshe
and sorowe were passed / and without gyuynge
them leyser to thynke on theyr affayres / we sholde fynde
them so vnpurueyde / that in them sholde be lytell resystence / 
and there is myne aduyce vnd

as me semeth yf that we myght conquere this countree
ye sholde be worthy to haue grete louynge and recōmendacyon / 
and shall be dynge neuer to be put out of memorye
amonst the noble & valyannt men. Those capytaynes
herynge the wordes of Olyuer preysed hym moche
in theyr hertes / and well semed theym that that whiche
he had sayd proceded of a hyghe and noble courage / therfore
all of one accorde without lōge counsayl sayde vnto
hym. Olyuer we ben departed for to serue the Kynge agaynst
his enemyes / and the after / and therfore we telle
you that where someuer ye wyll go / we shall folowe you
as they that wyll lyue and deye with you / and neuer too
fayle you. ¶Olyuer seynge the affeccyon of those noble
men towarde hym / and the good wyll that they hadde / 
to do the kynge seruyce / thāked them / in offrynge vnto
them bothe body and goodes.

the whiche was socoured of foure other kynges /

               BY this maner was concluded the vyage in to
Irlande / and toke in the towne as many pauelyons
and tētes as they myghte gete / and
all thynge that was necessarye for theyr vyage / 
and departed from thens / and toke with
them a thousande men on horsbacke / and as many on fote
/ without theyr nombre. And also they toke with them
as moche artyllerye & other habyllementes of warre as

that they myght well haue without dysgarnysshynge of
the towne / and it was tolde them afore theyr departynge / 
by them that had charge for to bury the deed folke y•
they had founde deed of theyr enemyes .xxiiij.M. and of
theyr mē .xij.C. wherfore theyr frendes were ryght dyspleasaunt.
And they assembled shyppes and entred into
y• see / and dyde so moche that in shorte tyme they were
oute of the realme of Englande / and entred in to Irlande
where as they began for to do moche harme / and foū
               de
but fewe places that resysted agaynst them / for they
be not so stronge as these of this regyon. They that were
taken by force had no mercy but that they slewe them
all. They that dyde yelde them to theym afore that they
besyeged them / were taken to mercye. And wt this they
fered so sore theyr enemyes / that the moost parte of them
yelded them or they came to them. Then ye kynges of y•
countree that were escaped fro the batayll were soo sore
abasshed that they coude not put no consayll to theyre
affayres / for theyr folke were yet full of sorowe / bycause
of the dolorous fortune that hadde happened theym.
Wherfore they habandonned all in the wyll of god / and
alonely fortefyed the places where as they wolde retray
them / but this was not but that they gaue often assaultes
and scarmoshes to the Englyshmen ryght subtyllye
gouerned on theyr syde / wherthrughe there was many
men slayne on bothe partyes. And in suche wyse by successyon
of tyme that the moost parte yelded them to thē
And ye ryche themself helped for to warre agaynst theyr

where as one of the kynges of Irlande was / that hadde
ben newe crowned. And was his sone that Olyuer dyd
slee at the torneyment. The whiche they assaylled ryght

quyckely / and boystously / and there was done on the one
syde and on the other grete dedes of armes For they that
were within the castell defended them vygorously / soo
that they receyued that daye but lytell dommage. The
kȳge Maquemor was aduertysed of these, thynges / and
how the fyege was afore the place of his cousyn. Wherfore
he was ryght dyspleasaunt. And swore by his crowne
that it sholde not abyde se. He assembled as moche folke
as he myght. And then he the thyrde kynge came for to
aryse the syege. Olyuer was aduertysed of all these thȳ
               ges / 
wherfore he put hymselfe on the felde for to abyde
them. And lefte a partye of his folke for to kepe the syege.
He put his folke in ordynaūce / and abode his enemees
all redy for to fyght / the whiche a

               ode not longe or y•
they came. And whan they sawe that Olyuer was alredy
on the felde / they knewe well that they coude not escape
without medlynge. And then they put theyr folke in
ryght fayre ordenaunce / and began for to shote gonnes
and Olyuer and his folke remeuyd not / but abode thē
with ferme fote / and with one crye receyued them at the
poyntes of theyr swerdes & speres. And there was slayn
at the fyrst recountre dyuers mē on bothe partyes. Full
many ladyes lost theyr lordes / and many chyldren were
faderles / and full many maydens lost theyr louers there
Olyuer cutte of hedes and armes in suche maner that
neuer mā dyde more dedes of armes than he dyde. Not
withstandynge the Irysshmen solde theyr lyues ryghte
derely / as men replenysshed with prowesse / for as them
semed and they lost that batayll / that in lyke wyse they
sholde lese theyr countree / wherfore theyr courage doubled
and dyde as well as they myght. In that estate dured
the batayll almoost vnto theyr nyght / but in the ende

the Irysshemen were dyscomfyted / as they that myghte
not endure the

And on y• morowe he made to crye that euery body sholde
put hym in payne for to do his deuoyre to take ye place.
Then ye sholde haue sene many a valyaunt knyght
and squyre / and mē of armes go to the assaulte but they
of within defended them soo valyaūtly that it was grete
meruayll. And the kȳge sayd that he hadde leuer deye

and to hym that hadde slayne his fader.

was smyten downe / and then it was assaylled at that
syde. Olyuer was in that assaulte and bare hym so valyauntly

that he was the fyrste that entred in / wherfore al
his men folowed hym. And at that tyme was the castell
wonne / and the kynge taken. But afore that he was taken
he dyde grete dedes of armes / and all the other were
slayne. Olyuer departed from thens / and lefte good
garnyson there. He put hym on the waye for to goo conquere
the realme of the sone of hym that he hadde slayne
in the fyrst batayll. But that same kynge abode not his
comyng / but came agaynst Olyuer without ony armoure
at all / berynge in his hande a braunche of Olyue in y•
sygne of peas. And whan he sawe Olyuer he sayd to hȳ
O ryght valyaunt conquerour / afore whome nothynge
can endure / by the furoure of thy swerde thou haste subdued
seuen kyngdomes / and hast the kynges prysoners
wherfore I knowe that my persone alonely can not resyste
agaynste thy persone and puyssaunce. Therfore I
come and yelde me at thy wyll / and do offre me and my
realme for to serue the. Olyuer thanked hym and tooke
hym by the hande / & sayd that he sholde soupe with hym
that nyght. Then Olyuer commaunded that the tētes
sholde be pyght in a fayre grene felde that was no ferre
from thē / by the whiche dyuers ryuers and fountaynes
passed by / wherfore the place was more delectable. Olyuer
cōmaunded that the kynges that had bē prysoners
of longe tyme / the whiche were abyden in a stronge for
tresse not ferre from thē sholde be brought to hym / and
made to saye to his cooke that he sholde make redy the
souper in y• best maner that he coude / for he wolde feest
the seuen kynges in his pauylyon. And whā the houre
of souper approched / he made them to sytte downe at a
table / and souped rychely. After souper Olyuer made auoydaunce / 
and sayd vnto the seuen kynges howe that

they were prysoners / not to come of them / but at the plesure
and wyll of the kynge of Englāde / that they hadde
so vylaynously offended and made grete doubte that he
wolde punysshed them greuously as it apperteyned / &
tolde them that they sholde be ledde to hym on the next
morowe / and that they sholde thynke on that that they
wolde doo / for to amende the offence that hadde ben done
by them.

called vnto hym a ryght valyaunt knyght and one of ye
capytaynes Englysshe / to whome he prayed moche curtaysly
that he wolde goo towarde the kynge & denounce
to hym theyr comynge / and that he coude tell hym the

they were on ye waye to retorne / and that ye seuen kyngedomes
of Irlande were conquered / and put in ye obeyssaunce

seuen kynges prysoners for to doo with them his good
pleasure. And began to deuyse hym of ye valyaunce that

he hadde done to the kynges persone. And alwaye pray
synge and louynge Olyuer / saynge that it was a thynge
of the other worlde / and not for to byleue to theym that

fayre Helayne that was moche Ioyous of that whiche
she herde / and her thought that and he hadde ben kynge

Wherfore her courage blamed strōgly her fader bycause
that he kepte from so gentyll a knyght that y• whiche

salued / and sayd to them that the Kynge his lorde wolde
speke with them and soupe with them / they sayd that
they wolde go gladlye / and mounted on horsbacke / and
Olyuer also with them that conduyted them. And whā
they entred in to the courte dyuers lordes / and prynces
of Englande came agaynst them that dyde lede them to

And so longe they were in these deuyses that the houre
of souper was comen / and the water blowen. The Kynge
of Englande had ordeyned that thre tables sholde be
sette in the halle. One more eleuate and hygher thā the
other. And at that table the kynge satte hym downe / and
commaunded Olyuer for to sytte with hym / the whiche
durst not dysobeye the kynges commaundement. And
therfore all ashamed he satte hȳ downe / and there was
no moo. After he commaunded that the Kynges of Irlande
sholde be sette. The mayster cōtroller that knewe
well ynoughe what he sholde do / made them for to sytte
at the seconde table / and all the other prynces the which
were without nombre satte at the thyrde table / and were

ryght sumptuously seruyd.

and that she had salued her fader / she salued after the seuen

kynges / euen so as she coude full well do it / and the
other lordes ensewynge. Then were the daunces begon
the whiche the kynge behelde gladly. And in beholdȳge
Olyuer daūce / he thought in hym selfe how it sholde be
possyble for to rendre to hym the guerdon of his seruyce
And thoughte soo moche that a more gretter thynge he
myghte not gyue hym than his doughter / that afore he
had wōne by force of armes / but bycause that he hadde
taken her from hym / parauēture he wolde haue dysdayne
for to take her agayne / wherfore he concluded for to
speke to hym after the daūces in the presence of all them
that were there / or that wolde be there. And euen soo as
he had thought it he dyde it. And whan all was faylled / 
and that his doughter was comen for to gyue hym good

be in her chābre / that she sholde not hye her vnto bedde
The whiche dyde euen so. After he called Olyuer in the
presence of the kynges of Irlande / and of the other prynces
and lordes that were there. Olyuer my frende I begyn
for to haue knowlege of my caas / and how that of
longe tyme I haue with holdē that whiche ought to be

quene of all ye worlde I wolde thynke her wel bestowed

Thus I then knowynge all these thynges shall gyue to

yf it please you for to take her to your wyfe. Wherby
after my deth ye may be kynge of Englande / the whiche
wolde be ryght happy to haue suche a lorde. Thē fynysshed
the kyng his wordes. Whan Olyuer sawe that the

kynge had fynysshed his wordes / he sette hym on bothe
his knees / and began to saye these wordes. Ryght honourable
lorde / truely there is no seruyce but of a kynge
for I may wel auaunte me / that with lytell deseruynge
I haue the gretest guerdon that euer hadde man / wherof
I gyue louynges to god and to you graces and thankes / 
nor neuer poore man as I am hadde the hondrethe

he gyue me grace to deserue it vnto your hyghnesse. For
by you my name shall be chaunged / and they that shall

               THen the kynge commaunded Olyuer for to

she was comen / he toke her by the hande and
leddeher to hym and sayd. My frende se here
my doughter that I gyue you to your wyfe / 
in acquytynge my promesse. Olyuer thanked hym ryghte
humblye. The poore Helayne that of al this knewe

and began for to chaunge coloure / wherby her beaute
was nor mynysshed. Whan the kyng sawe her in that

all troubled you as semeth me / whā I haue gyuē you to
a man without knowynge your wyll. But by the helpe
of god he shall do nothynge to you but that ye may well
suffre and endure / as I deme. Then Olyuer began for
to laughe at the wordes that the kynge had sayd. Wherfore
Helayne was more ashamed than she had ben afore
The archebysshop that was in the halle dyde handfeste

of Olyuer / he was contente to rendre to them theyr realmes / 
quyte theyr raunsons / and sende them agayne in

fro thens forth to holde hym for theyr souerayne lorde / 
They knowynge that of two euylles it is the beste to eschewe
the worste / accorded to the kynges request / & dyd

thynges / and that they had daunced ones aboute for the
espousayles euery body wente to bedde / but Olyuer slepte
not that nyght / but watched al yt nyght / as he y• wolde

the kynge that knewe well ynoughe that Olyuer
coude not haue his gownes made so soone / sente hym / 
thre or foure gownes of clothe of golde beten. And whā
Olyuer was apparaylled / all the prynces and lordes came

and the other twayne abode for to accompany the fayre

            ¶How Olyuer wedded the fayre Helayne / and of y•
solempnyte of the espousaylles. Capitulo. xlix.
            
               RYght sone after that all these thynges were
redy. Olyuer came in to ye courte accōpanyed
as ye haue herde afore / & wente to ye portall
of ye chapell / where as he foūde ye Arche

whan that they herde comynge to them grete foyson of

               
trompettes / and mynstrelles / and began for to sowne / 
and come to warde the chapell after them / and there came
dyuers kynges and herauldes of armes / and after
came the Usshers And after theym then came Helayne
aourned as it apperteyneth to a bryde / and to a lady of
so ryall a lygnage. She was accompanyed of dyuers ladyes
and damoyselles that folowed her. And with this
she was on the ryght hande of two kynges. And came a
softe paas vnto the place where as Olyuer abode her / 

And they hadde not ben longe there whan the kynge came / 
at whose comynge they were wedded. The seruyce
was done. The tables were layde / & then they set them
to dyner after that the ladyes were retorned frome the
chambres. Who that wolde deuyse to you the scruyce of
the sayd dyner / the gyftes that were gyuen as well on
the one syd

to recoūte. The yonge men of the kynges courte that
neuer were dyfferent to no thynge that was for Iustes
made crye a Iustynge for the after dyner / where as the
ladyes were. Also a torneyment was cryed .xvj. agaynst
xvi. that was a ryght fayre syght to se. Olyuer Iusted
not bycause he sholde not be defouled / & to the ende that
he sholde be fresshe for to daunce at nyghte / but he was
moūted on a grete courser and dyde meruaylles. He serued
one of the kynges of Irlande / that for to do hym honoure
Iusted / and foure of the other also. And dyde soo
well that twayne of the fyue had the pryce / one within / 
and the other without. And it was gyuen theym or that
they departed from the tyltes / as they that hadde done
best. And after that euery body was comē to the courte
the ladyes were clothed in newe gownes. And then they
wente to the banquet that was alredy apparaylled. Yf
they were well seruyd it is no nede to demaunde it. For
there was neuer a fayrer feest in England / after that
of the grete torneyment / that had ben afore. And whan
it was after the banquet ye daunces began / and Olyuer
ledde the fayre Helayne at the daunces / that euery body
sawe gladly. For all the worlde sayd that they had neuer
sene a more fayrer couple of folke togyder. After that y•
daunces had endured a longe space of tyme / the farre &
noble Helayne was ledde vnto bedde. And then wyne &

spyces were broughte. The whiche Olyuer abode not / 
For he was alredy in his chambre where as he dysabylled

locked it / and wente to bedde to her that of longe tyme
he hadde loued / & she hated hym not / wherfore they were
the better contente togyder / and of the surplus I holde
my peas. But the hystorye sayth that vpon that same
nyght they engendred a chylde male / the whiche dydde
sythe moche good / and exalted our crystē fayth agaynst

               WHan it came to the kynges knowlege that
Olyuer had casten downe the table y• the

sayd y• he had ryght well wrought / wherfore
no body wolde not medle for to entre in
y• chambre / & was not awaked of no body vnto the moro

whiche came vnto the chambre dore / and beganne for to
call them / and sayd that it was daye & tyme for to ryse / 

Olyuer the whiche slepte not came in his sherte and opened
the dore to the kynge / the whiche entred alone / and
came vnto his doughters bedde / where as he cōforted
her as well as he myght. In saynge y• he knewe it well
of longe ago that she was to yonge for to slepe with the

thȳge that he coude doo. Wherfore he toke leue of her / &
sayd to her that she was euyll contente with hym sythe
that she wolde not speke to hȳ. After that he was departed / 
the ladyes came and toke her vp. Thenne whan she
was redy she wente to masse / but this was not without
foyson of regardes of dyuers lordes and ladyes / the whiche
with one accorde Iuged y• she halted not. The masse
was sayd / and the dyner passed / the whiche was ryghte
plenteuous of all goodes. And ye kynge helde open courte
by the space of .xv. dayes / after the whiche all the lordes
toke leue of hym. And the kyng abode in his symple
estate / reserued that Olyuer had his estate as a kynges
sone / and reteyned dyuers gentylmen of his courte The
kynges of Irlande toke theyr leue for to retorne home / 
In offrynge them alwaye at ye kynges pleasure / & Olyuers / 
for god had gyuen hym suche grace that euery body
loued hym. The debates and dyscordes amonge the
gentylmen. Olyuer appeased to his power. The poore
knyghtes by his largesse were made ryche. He was the
defendour of wydowes and Orphelyns / and to his power
to all dyscomforted and dyssolute he gaue comforte
and coūsayll. Shortly all vertues that were possyble to
be in a mannes mortall body / florysshed in this ryght valyaunt
and gentyll knyght / in suche wyse that euery body
louyd hym & blessyd his comynge. And helde the kynge
for wyse and prudent that so sone coude knowe his cō
               dycyons / 

and that he had so kepte his doughter to mary
her so vertuously / without thȳkynge on couetyse / so
the kynge lyued in grete ease within his courte / & in grete
louȳge and glorye without. And was so moche fered
and redoubted that none durst do hym dyspleasure / but
was mayster and lorde of all his neyghbours. The fayr
& good Helayne that was with chylde was not of lesse
recommendacyon ayenst her / for all vertues that a woman
ought for to haue habounded in her. It happened
that after that she had borne her terme / she was delyuered
of a payre sone / the whiche was named at the fonte
stone Henry. And this chylde gaue so moche Ioye to the
kynge / and to all them of the realme y• it was metuayll
But that same chylde wyst and knewe that he ought yet
to be the moost derest holden of all the other. For he was
one of the best and valyauntest knyghtes that euer was
Neuerthelesse he was not kynge of Englande / for he deyed
yonge / wherof it was grete dommage. ¶ A lōge tyme
dyde passe and so moche that the fayre Helayne was
with chylde agayne / the whiche was delyuered of a fayre
doughter / y• whiche was ryght solempnelye baptysed
and she was named Clarysse. The fayre Helayne and
Olyuer were so assotted and doted on theyr chyldrē that
it was a grete meruayll / and I am not abasshed. For
they ought well to be so. The moder hadde them alwaye
bytwene her armes / and myght not forgo the syght of
them. It was the passe tyme of Olyuer / for the realme
of Englande was in peas / and wyst not wherin to occupye
hym saue to goo on huntynge / and haukynge / and
for to make good chere.

of his wyfe the whiche she tolde vnto hȳ. Capi. lj.
            OLyuer passed his tyme Ioyously / soo as ye
haue herde. ¶It happened that the hunters
made hym to knowe that the grettest
wylde bore that euer was sene / was in the
forest fyue myle thens. Olyuer that loued
well hūtynge was ryght Ioyous / and sayd that he wolde
go ryght gladly / wherfore on an after none he departed
from the cyte / & lodged hym in a vyllage by y• forest
where the wylde bore was in. That nyght his wyfe dremed
a meruaylous dreme / for her thought that she was
on huntynge with her lorde / and that she sawe a Tygre
meruaylously grete / that with his teeth / and his nayles
deuoured Olyuer / and bare hym awaye she wyste not
where Of his vysyon all trymblynge the fayre Helayne
awaked / and coude not slepe after that. And on the morowe
she sente worde to her lorde / & requyred hym that
he wolde not hunte as for that daye / for and he dyde her
herte Iuged her that he sholde haue some hurte. Olyuer
herynge the message of his wyfe dyde no thynge but laughe / 
for hym semed y• dremes were but fantasyes / wherfore
he sente worde to his wyfe that she sholde make gode
chere / & that he wolde brynge her some venyson / then
he mounted on horsbacke and wente to y• forest / and vncoupled
the houndes / and began for to hunte. Thē Olyuer
put hym in to the forest / and folowed the houndes / 
wherfore he dyde folye. For yf he had byleued the counsayll
of his wyfe / it had not happened to hym as it dyde
For so as he folowed the houndes as nere as he myghte
the wylde bore came that was on fote / and trauersed

afore hym. Olyuer that was welhorsed smote hym with
the sporres / and ranne after. And he dyde so moche that
he had lost all his men within a lytell whyle. Alas yf he
had knowen of the euyll aduenture / he wolde not haue
putte hym so soone in the forest / but as he that toke no
hede rode on alwaye without kepynge ony waye / so as
his euyll aduenture ledde hym. O kynge of Englande
truely of a longe tyme thou shalte not se thy fayre sone
Olyuer / nor thou ryght fayre Helayne of a longe tyme
thou shalt not se thy lorde and husbande.

founde Olyuer all alone frō his mē / & toke hym

for hym. Capitulo. lij.
            AFore that Olyuer apperceyued that no body
dyde folowe hym / he was ferre from his
folke. And whan he founde hymselfe alone / 
he blewe his horne / but none answered hym
Wherfore he put hym on the waye in an vnhappy
houre. For the more that he wente forwarde / the
ferder he was from them. Thus as he wente so the wylde
bore that was ferre from hym / came amōgest a company
of men that passed thorughe the forest / the whiche
wente to London. And the chyef was one of the kynges
of Irlande / that same that Olyuer had slayne the fader
of at the torneymente. As he sawe the wylde bore / with
suche houndes as he had he folowed / and ranne soo moche
in the forest that they recoūtred Olyuer whiche was
all alone. Then Olyuer auaunced hym and salued the
kynge / but the kynge dysdayned to speke to hym. And
he escryed to his men saynge / here is the murderer that
hathe slayne my fader. Wherfore I do pray you that ye
wyll take hȳ alyue / for I can not auenge me better than
at this tyme. And whan Olyuer herde these wordes he
sethande to his swerde / and defended hym ryght valyauntly.
But in the ende whether he wolde or not he was
taken. And the kynge made a hode all close to be put on
his heed / to the ende that he sholde not be knowen / and
in that estate he made hym to be ledde to a porte of y• see

where as he was put in a shyp and ledde in to a fortresse
of Irlande that was that same kynges. In the whiche
Olyuer was put in pryson full of vermyne / and had brede
and water ones a daye. Abydynge the retornynge of

And to the ende that his treason were not knowen / 
he retorned not / but wente to London towarde the kynge

for he had herde no tydynges of Olyuer the
whiche was soughte on all sydes. O what pyteous and
innumerable lamentacyons was made whan y• trouthe
was knowen that he coude not be founden. Certaynlye

trauaylled whan I reposed me / & he by whome I was

were nothynge in comparyson to the pyteous lamentacyons
that his doughter made. She myght neyther ete
nor drynke / but had layde her on a bedde as she had bendeed / 
in suche wyse that all they that sawe her had grete

Olyuer. Capitulo. liij.
            
               
            
            
               
WE haue herde here before how Olyuer was
departed from Castylle / and of the meruaylous
dule that the good kȳge demeaned bycause
of his departyng / the whiche neuer lette
hym vnto the dethe / for within shorte space
it made hym fynysshe his dayes / and lyucd not longe
after the departynge of his sone. For the whiche cause
Arthur kynge of Algarbe / and felowe of Olyuer / by the
consente of dyuers lordes of the countree / was chosen
for to be Regente of Castylle vnto the retornynge of Olyuer.
And by cause that the affayres of the realme of castyll
be gretter than they of Algarbe the whiche is but a
lytell coūtree. Arthur helde hym moost in Algarbe. And
forgate neuer to vysyte the glasse of his felowe. And soo
moche that he apperceyued that the sayd glasse was suche
as the lettre specyfyed. That is for to knowe that the
water was troubled and gretely obscure. In suche wyse
that it was almoost lyke ynke. And whan Arthur apper
ceyued it suche / with grete haboundaunce of teres he began
for to saye in this maner. O ryght noble ryght valyaunt
& loyall felowe / I se well that ye haue some grete
empesshynge / or some euyll aduenture / or in fermyte
of body wherfore I am ryght dyspleasaunt. And bycause
that at a nede one knoweth his frende I make auowe
to god and promyseth hym by the fayth that I owe vnto
hym / and to the crowne that I bere / that euen as secretely
as ye departed from this realme / shall I departe
also. Nor neuer as longe as I lyue shall I not reste / tyll
that I knowe whether that ye be a lyue or deed. Thē in
wypȳge his eyen / he departed out of the chambre / and
came in to a halle. And commaūded to make lettres for
to assemble all the thre estates / and all the prynces of the

countree. And whan they were all assembled / he began
for to shewe them and sayd that it was not possyble for
hym to gouerne bothe ye realmes well that he had in his
charge. And therfore his wyll was for to commyse some
dyscrete prynce in his stede to be Regent of Castyll. For
he wolde retorne in to that of Algarbe / bycause that he
loued it more / for bycause that it was his propre herytage / 
and that it was the place of his byrthe. Therfore he
wolde knowe of them / yf it were theyr good pleasure y•
he resygned his estate at his dyscrecyon to the moost wysest
as hȳ semed. Or yf they wolde chese one after theyr
dyscrecyon and counsayll. They answered. Ryght puyssaunt
kynge of Algarbe we haue not holden you for Regente / 
but for kynge vnto the comynge of Olyuer as ye
do knowe / for we neuer founde you dysobeyssaunt. And
also there is none of vs but that we wolde do you as sone
pleasure as to our souerayne lorde. Your wyll and departynge
is full greuous vnto vs. But syth it is so that
we can not kepe you / chese whiche of vs it shall please
you and gyue hym your stede. For we shall holde youre
eleccyon. For all that we shall neuer haue man soo dcre
as you. Arthur thanked them / & dyde chese a good prynce
that was ryght vertuous for to be regente. And then
he toke leue of them in grete wepynges. And then he toke
a certayne nombre of men with hym / and he dyde somoche
that within a shorte space he came in to his realme / 
and whan he was there / he recommaunded to his
conestable all the gouernaunce of his countree. And after
commaunded al his men to obeye to hym / and sayde
that he wolde ge in to a place all alone / the whiche was
not ferre of. And that with the grace of god he wolde not
tarye longe. This done he departed in a fayre mornyng

and wente his waye withouten ony company / saue of
god alonely / to whome I praye that he be in his garde / 
for grete nede he hadde therof / as ye shal here here after
warde.
         
         
            ¶How Arthur departed / and put hym on the waye
for to fynde his felowe / and of the aduentures that
he had. Capitulo. liiii.
            
               IN suche maner as ye haue herde departed the
valyaunt and gentyll Arthur from his countree.
And began for to serche tydynges of his
felowe / as he that hadde wyll neuer for to reste
tyll that he had herde tydynges of hym. The
fyrste countree that he arryued in was Portyngale / in
the whiche he founde nothynge that was pleasaunt vnto
hym. After he sought the remenaunt of Spayne / and
came in to that of Fraunce / and wente so moche on one
syde and other that he came to Calys / where as he founde
men that wente in to Englande / and therfore he moū
               ted
on the see for to go theder. Ye maye well thynke that
he was longe in serchynge the coūtrees that ye haue herde
aboue. In this meane whyle Olyuer his felowe was
alwaye in pryson / with brede and water / and oftē bette
as he that had neuer hope to departe thens. And desyred
nothynge but the dethe. ¶ As Arthur was on y• see for
to go in to Englande / there happened a wynde contrary
to aryse on the see / and droue them in to the marches
that the maryners knewe not atte that presente tyme.
But whan that they had longe beholden & sene it / they

apperceyued that it was one of the countrees and realmes
of Irlande / the ferdest from y• of Englande. Whan
Arthur herde saye that it was one of the realme of Irlande / 
he prayed them that they wolde set hym a lande / 
for as hym semyd / as sone myght he here tydynges of y•
whiche he soughte / as in another countree / so as he dyde
by the wyll of god euen so as ye shall here. Whā Arthur
was on grounde / he wente on fote in praynge our lorde
for to adresse hym on his waye. He was well the space of
two monethes in that coūtree. And whan he wolde haue
ony thynge he muste make some sygne / or elles they
coude not vnderstande hym. He hadde neyther hors nor
mule for to ryde on / wherfore he wente on fote / and soo
longe he wente that on a daye he founde hymselfe in a
thycke forest / in the whiche dyuers wylde beestes dydde
remayne. They had wel made hym sygne that he sholde
not entre in to that forest but he had not vnderstonden
them. He wente all the daye alonge the forest withoute
fyndynge of ony aduenture. The nyght toke hym wherfore
it was force to hym for to slepe. And whan it came
vpon the morowe / he put hym on y• waye ryght euylly
broken his faste. And he had not longe gone whan he apperceyued
a grete and an horryble lyon strongly oppressyd
with hongre. For he had founde no praye of longe tyme.
Wherfore whan Arthur sawe and apperceyued that
he came towarde hym he appareylled hym for to fyghte
for he was armed at all poyntes / and also he had a good
swerde. He toke of his mauntell and wounde it aboute
his arme / and then he drewe out his swerde / and kyssed
the hyltes / in recommaundynge hym to god / and wēte
towarde the lyon / that doubted hym but lytell. For whā
it came to approche he gaue hȳ suche a stroke with his

pa
                  ••
               es that he rente his cloke / and mo than a hond
                  •
               eth
mayles of his haubergon. And it was force to Arthur
for to fall to the erthe / but as a valyaunt knyght he gate
hym on his fece. And incontynent he began for to assayll
the lyon ryght asprely. And whan the lyon 
                  •
               elte 
                  •
               ymself
hurte / he began for to caste a crye so meruaylous that
all ye forest dyde rynge of it. And Arthur recouered another
stroke / and sette it so well on that he smote of his hede / 
and so the lyon deyed.
         
         
            ¶How Arthur beynge in the forest was assaylled of
another meruaylous beest / of the whiche he was vyetoryous. lv.
            
               
            
            
               
               AS Arthur sawe that he was delyuered of y•
lyon / he thāked god with a meke herte / and
whan it came vnto y• nyght and that he founde
hym not out of the forest / noo more than
yf he hadde not remeuyd out of one place / he
was moche dyspleasaunt / as he that of all the daye had
not eten / but his comforte was whan he thoughte vpon
saynt Iohan Baptyst that lyued by rotes / and hym semyd
that he sholde be ryght meschaunt yf he myght not
lyue with suche vytaylles for a space of tyme. So he began
for to serche aboute the forest / and began for to cete
herbes and rotes suche as he founde by so grete appetyte
for hongre / that he had neuer eten capon in his countree
that had semed hym so good. And whan the nyghte
came he put hym on a lytell tree / for drede of dombe beestes.
Then within the nyght whan the mone was fayre
and clere / he herde a thynge come a ferre that made soo
grete a noyse that it was a hydeous thynge to here for
in his waye he smote downe all that he mette to the erth
And whysteled soo hye that it thrughe perced Arthurs
eres. The whiche whā he herde that meruayll / he begā
for to blysse hym / in recommaundynge hym vnto god,
praynge hym for to be his defendour agaynst that beest
that he sawe comynge. And euen so as he recommaunded
hym to god / this meruaylous beest came towarde y•
tree that he was mounted on / and smote the tree with
his tayle so empyteously that he fell downe to the erthe / 
whan the poore Arthur founde hymselfe on the grounde / 
yf that he had fere and drede I am nothynge ameruaylled / 
and I thynke well that he wolde haue bē in his
countree agayne with a good wyll. But as a valyaunte
knyght he prayed god that he wolde haue mercy on his

soule. For he thought that his laste daye had ben comen
and sette hande to his swerde for to defende hym / yf the
beest assaylled hym. For he had no wyll for to delyuer y•
fyrst assaulte the beest was passed wherof Arthur was
ryght Ioyous / but within a whyle the beest retorned to
warde hym agayne in enuyronnynge hym Th
                  •
               n he made
hym to torne thre or foure tornes / and made hym for
to fall agaȳst a tree so harde that it lacked but lytell that
the herte of the valyaunt Arthur dyde byrste. ¶ Arthur
was not so soone vp but that the beest was besyde hym
and he as wyse lenyd agaynst a tree. And whan y• beest
thought for to haue smyten hym / he smote ye tree / wherfore
he endommaged hym but lytell or nought. But her
tethe was longe and cuttynge meruaylously / wherwith
she strayned hym in suche wyse that yf it hadde not ben
the tree that he helde hym by / he sholde nothynge haue
resysted. For alredy he was so sore wounded that he had
nothynge on hym but that it was perced. He reuenged
hym valyauntly and gaue hym grete and sadde strokes
but she hadde so harde a skynne that in no wyse he myght
dommage it. The synke of her alonely greued Arthur
as moche as all the remenaunt. The whiche whan
he sawe the beest that for nothynge that he had done she
was as fresshe as she was at the begynnyng of the med
lynge / he began for to reclayme our lorde / in praynge hȳ
that he wolde haue pyte on his creature / and sayd. ¶Ha
my ryght swete lorde and felowe by the cause I shall fynysshe
here my lyfe / but and I hadde sene the afore my
dethe. I sholde ende the surplus of my lyfe with a better
wyll.
         
         
            
            ¶How Arthur lyenge in the woode all hurte / appered
to hym an auncyent knyght the whiche helyd hȳ / 
and after told vnto hym the place where as Olyuer
was prysoner in. Capitulo. lvj.
            
               
            
            
               IN complaynynge hym the beest kepte hym soo
straytlye that he smote hym downe to the erthe
vnder hym / and helde hym so fast with his nayles
that all that he had holde of was in pyeces / 
in suche wyse that Arthur myght not remeue
hym. For all that oure lorde the whiche neuer forgeteth

his frendes at theyr nede / forgate not this gētyll knyghte / 
nor wolde not suffre the losse of hym. For ye beest that
helde hym so straytlye / lete goo her holde that she helde
with her feete / for to take hym with the 
                  •
               ethe to deuoure
hym / but whan Arthur felte his armes delyuered / he
that had yet his swerde smote hym vnder the na
                  •
               yll / the
whiche was not so harde as the backe / and thrysted hym
to the herte. And whan the beest felte hym wounded / in
castynge a grete crye lete hym fall to the erthe. And Arthur
that felte hym delyuered / gaue hym so many strokes
that he slewe hym. It was not longe after that the
daye came / but that recomforted hym nothynge for he
myght not from one place / as he that abode but he dethe / 
bycause of the woundes that he had receyued. And
thus as he was in daūger as ye haue herde / yet agayne
he herkened towarde the forest / and apperceyued a thȳ
               ge
comynge towarde hym / wherfore he thoughte better
to haue ben deed than afore. Therfore he sayd / Ryghte
gloryous vyrgyn Mary be myn aduocate / and that ye
wyll to daye present my poore soule afore the face of thy
blessyd sone. For I se will that the houre is comen that
I must departe out of this worlde. That thynge approched
more nerer and nerer. And whan he was all moost
at hym. Arthur knewe y• it was a man clothed in whyte
whiche began for to saye Kynge of Algarbe god salueth
the. And whan Arthur herde hym named kynge / he made
the sygne of the crosse and sayd vnto hym / arte thou a
thynge of the other worlde. I thynke y• thou arte transmysed
from god / syth that by hym thou hast salued me.
For other wyse thou coude not haue knowen my name / 
And therfore I praye the that thou haue pyte on me / &
that thou do so moche that I may be aledged of my hurtes / 

and that I maye be put out of this forest wherin I
haue had so moche to suffre. This man answered to hȳ
Arthur thou hast not fayled for to say that I am of god
For so it is. And thynke that I am comen for your aledgemente.
Then he alyghted of his hors / and fatte hym
downe on the erthe besyde hym / & drewe out of his purse
a boxe of golde full of precyous oyntementes / with ye
whiche oyntement he anoynted and touched all his woū
               des / 
and gaue hym a rote for to ete. And incontyneute
as he hadde tasted of it / he was as hole and safe as euer
he hadde ben. Wherfore his medecyne clothed in whyte
dyde bydde hym that he sholde thanke god / by whome
he was sente theder. Arthur dyde so as he had cōmaunded
hym / and gaue louynges to god. Thenne the whyte
man made hym for to moūte vpon his hors behynde hȳ
and sayd to hym that he sholde put hym out of the forest
And then in goynge he sayd to hym. Kynge of Algarbe / 
I knowe well wherfore that thou arte departed out of
thy countree. It is for to leke Olyuer of Castylle thy felowe
wherfore I shall tell you tydynges. Knowe that
after his departynge he arry
                  •
               ed in the realme of Englā
               de / 
whereas he hathe gouerned hym so well that by his
prowesse he hathe wonne ye onely doughter of the kynge
the whiche is one of the fayrest ladyes of the worlde / but

                  〈…〉
                fortuned to hym / for a kynge of Irlande the
whiche loued hym not / bycause he had slayne his fader / 
hathe taken hym prosoner / and hathe put hym in a dongeon / 
where as he suffreth as moche mysery as ony man
is possyble for to suffre. But haue no doubte of his lyfe.
For he shall neuer deye vnto the tyme that thou hast casten
hym out / and yf that I had to counsayll the / and y•
thou wolde byleue me / I wolde counsayll the for to goo

fyrste to London / for to comforte the kynge and his doughter.
For thou knowest that thou resemblest Olyuer / &
that it is all one thynge / wherfore Helayne shall thyn
                  ••
               
that thou arte her lorde / and shall guarysshe bycause of
thy comynge / and truely yf that thou haste the not thou
shalte neuer se her / for she is syke vnto the dethe / go and
lye with her to the ende that they byleue the better that
thou arte Olyuer / but beware the well thou thynke not
on vylanye / nor dys
                  ••
               onoure / for thou sholde offende to
gretely. And after that thou seest her in y• waye of helthe
departe the and come vnto this forest / for thou shalte here
tydynges of me here. In these deuyses he ledde hym
out of the woode / and made hym descende / then Arthur
sette hym on his knees / as afore a holy thynge and than
k
                  •
               d hym / but incontynent he lost the syght of hym without
knowynge where he became.
         
         
            ¶How Arthur by the counsayll of the whyte knyght
wente towarde the kynge of Englande at London / 
And of the Ioye that they made hym thykynge that
it hadde ben Olyuer. Capitulo. lviij.
            
               AS Arthur foūde hym alone in his waye / he
thanked god / and dyde so moche that he came
to the see / where as he foūde a shyp that
wente in to Englande / and entred in to it / &
whan he was in Englāde / the fyrst towne y•
he entred in was Brystowe / where as he was knowen
for Olyuer. And incontynent the tytynges were spred
all aboute. And some adressyd them vnto London / and

               
came and tolde the kynge. The whiche whan he knewe
it / he was so replenysshed with Ioye / and his herte soo
close with Ioye / that he hadde letten hymselfe fall to y•
erthe / yf some of his seruauntes had not susteyned hym
but for all that they must bere hym to bedde / where as
he was a space of tyme without ony knowlege. Neuerthelesse
he felle a slepe / and whan he was awaked he demaunded
of them of his chambre yf it were true that Olyuer
was alyue / and yf he dyde come. They answered
hym ye / wherof he was ryght gladde / and thanked god
but afore he knewe not whether that they had tolde it hȳ
or yf that he had dremed it. Thus as they were in these
deuyses came a squyre and knocked at the chambre dore
that sayd that they sholde axe the kynge yf he wolde see
Olyuer / the whiche wolde come shortely / for he was not

more thā a myle of. The kynge sente sone for his horses
and mounted vpon hym / for to goo agaynst hym. In lyke
wyse euery body wente in to the feldes / for to se hym
that was so moche desyred. And whan Arthur apperceyued
the people that came agaynst hym / the teres were
in his eyen / and began for to bewayle his fe
                  •
               owe. And
dyde so moche that he approched the kynge / and whan y•
kynge apperceyued hym that he had not sene of thre yere
before / hym semeth that it is none other but Olyuer
and also to al the other of his companye / wherfore with
bothe his armes abrode he ranne to hym / and beganne
for to embrace hym so strongly that it was meruayl / but
he myght not speke one worde to hym. And whan that
he myght speke / he sayd that he was ryght welcome / &
that he had done grete almesse for to retorne and comforte
this realm
                  •
                that was so replenysshed with dolour bycause
of his departynge. Arthur answered to hym. My
lorde that the whiche hathe ben done / was done agaynst
my wyll / nor other thynge I maye not saye / but by the
pleasure of god I shall 
                  •
               yue more Ioye and lyesse vnto
this realme bycause of my retornynge / than euer there
was sorowe for my departyng. And am more redyer for
to do you seruyce than euer I haue ben. Wherof I doo
thanke god.
         
         
            ¶How Arthur came and vysyted Helayne / the
whiche hadde wende yt he had ben Olyuer her
husbande / and of the solempnyte that was made.
And howe that he laye with her withouten
vylanye. Capitulo. lviij.
            
               
               
            
            
               AFter these deuyses Arthur salued the noble
men that werein the kȳges companye / and
generally al the other / but there came so many / 
that it was not possyble for them for to
entre in to ye cyte. Wherfore it was force for
them for to brynge a grete and a hye chayre of Cypres / 
vpon the whiche Arthur mounted / to the ende that he
were sene on euery syde / for to contente the people ye better.
Then it was cryed that euery body sholde retorne / &
after Arthur mounted vpon horsbacke. And whan he
entred in to London / none can not deuyse to you the Ioye
that was made on euery syde / ye stretes were hanged

ladyes and damoyselles were at the wȳdowes / the noyse
was so grete that it was meruayll for to here. And in
sygne of more gretter Ioye / bothe more and lesse cryed
Te deum laudamus. And whan they approched the palays
Helayne that was strongly syke / herde yt noyse where
as she laye / and demaunded what it was / but none
durst not tether / for fere leest that the sodayne Ioye sholde
haue ben to grete. Wherfore they abode the maystres
that dyde tell a ferre what it was. Whan she knewe it wher
handes Ioyned vp to heuen she beganne for to than
ke god in saynge. O redempt our of humayne lygnage I
rendre to the graces and thankes / whan that afore my
dethe I maye se hym that hathe put me in soo grete doloure.
¶Come now dethe whan that thou wylte / for I
shall abyde the Ioyously / syth that I knowe that my souerayne
lorde is comen / it can not greue me. The fayre
and good Helayne hadde grete talent for to see hym that
she wende hadde ben her husbande / but Arthur was in
grete thought how he myght demeane hym towarde y•
wyse of his felowe. For all that whan his botes were of / 
he wente towarde Helayne for to knowe how she dyde / 
And whan she sawe hym / she was a grete whyle or that
she myght speke. But whan that she myghte speke / she
sayd that she dydde well syth that she sawe hym in good
helthe. The oure of souper came / and therfore Arthur
toke leue of her / and prayed her that she wolde make gode
chere / and that she wolde thynke for to make her hole
The ladyes and damoyselles of the cyte of London were
somoued to souper / & there was made a meruaylous
Ioye / but yet it sholde haue bē more gretter yf it hadde
not ben for Helaynes maladye. And it was defended by
the kynge that none sholde werke of viij. dayes but eche

               
                  •
               nenst hym made the feest as grete as they myght. Arthur
by the counsayll of the medecyns / was excused for
to lye with Helayne bycause of her maladye / wherof he
was Ioyous without makynge ony semblaunt / but wt 
in shorte space she gate vp and founde guaryson & helth
And so moche that within a lytell tyme the physycyens
gaue hym leue for to lye with her / soo as he dydde. And
whan he was in bedde with her / he remeuyd not oute of
his place / but the fayre Helayne dyde not so / for she that
of longe tyme had not had the embrasynge of her lorde / 
begā for to approche / but Arthur drewe backe and sayd
to her / my loue withdrawe you in to your place agayne
for I haue made auowe that neuer by embracynge / nor
otherwyse I shall touche your body tyll that I haue payed

whiche made hym as good chere and honoure.
as he wolde haue done to Olyuer / thynkynge
that it hadde ben he / and also dyde Helayne / &
all the other. And whan he sawe that Helayne had ouercomen
her maladye / and that there was no more daunger / 
he came towarde ye kynge and sayd to hym that he
dyde owe a vyage to Saynt Iames / and that he muste
nedes do it withouten ony companye / wherfore he prayed
hym that he wolde be contente that he myght go alone / 
and that he wolde retorne agayne as shortely as he
myghte. The kynge asked hym yf that he was wery of
his wyfe alredy / and he answered nay. After he toke his

leue of the kynge for to departe / and on the morowethe
kynge prayed hym that he wolde not tary / and also that
he sholde take some company wt hym / but Arthur wolde
not do nothynge / and so departed all aloue after that
he had taken his leue of the fayre Helayne / and promysed
he
                  •
                that he sholde retorne ryght shortly. He dyde soo
moche that he arryued in the forest where as he had foū
               den
the whyte knyght. Neuertheles he durst not entre / 
for fere of the wylde beestes / and therfore he abode the
trouthe of his knyght there. And he was there soo longe
that he apperceyued hȳ comynge. Then Arthur salued
hym / and he rendred to hym his salute. Thēne he made
hym to mounte vp behynde hym / and sayd to hym. My
frende Arthur hast thou good wyll for to haue agayne
thy felow / darest thou put the in auenture for to recouer
hym. Truely layd Arthur there fs nothynge but that I
wolde do it for to recouer hym. Now I shall tell y• sayd
y• knyght / thou arte armed at all pyeces / wherfore thou
ought to be the more hardyer. I aduertyse the that the
kynge that holdeth Olyuer in pryson / is a good myle frō
his place with a lytell company. There is from hens theder
.xxxiij. myle / and there is but thre knyghtes with hȳ
all a fote / but and I thought that thou durst fyght with
them all foure for to gete agayne thy frende. I sholde lede
the theder in a lytell space. Arthur thanked hym / and
prayed hym that he wolde do so. The knyghte smote y•
hors with the sportes / and he had not so sone done it / but
that in a moment he was there as the kynge was. Thē
he shewed hym to Arthur and sayd. Arthur descende adowne
for yonder is thyn enemye / and yf that thou recouer
Olyuer / tell hym that the knyghte clothed in whyte
dothe salue hym / the whiche dyde brynge the heder.

Arthur dyde so moche that he approched to the
kynge. And incontynent he escryed hym to the
dethe / and then he sette hande to his swerde &
gaue one of his knyghtes suche a stroke / that he cloue hȳ
to the tethe. The seconde he smote of his harme and his
sholder. The thyrde he kest downe deed. The kynge had
but a shorte dager wherwith he defended hym valyaūtlye / 
but in the ende he fledde / and Arthur folowed hym
& gaue hȳ so grete a stroke with the platte of his swerde
that he smote hym downe astonyed / & then he sayd to hȳ
A fals traytour kynge / thou canst not denye but that y•
hast the kynge in thy pryson / wherfore enforce the for to
rendre hym to me / or elles I make auowe to god I shal
smyte of thy heed. The kȳge cryed hym mercy and sayd / 
O noble knyght saue my lyfe and I shall rendre hym to
the agayne. Arthur promysed hȳ that he wolde saue his
lyfe / so that he wolde sende hym to hym incontynente / &
that he wolde promyse hym to lette them go safe. ¶The
kynge promysed hym that he wolde do so. And then he
departed all mate / and dyscomfyted / and he dyde so moche
that he came in to his castell. And incontynent as he
was there / he commaunded that Olyuer sholde be drawen
out. Whan Olyuer was afore hym he sayd. Kynge
I pray the that thou slee me afore that I entre in agaȳ
in pryson. The kynge sayd to hym that it wente not soo / 
for a knyght hathe acquyted thy pryson / and I promysed
hym to sende the to hym. Thēne he badde gyue hym

newe clothes / so as it was done / and then he gaue hym
leue / but at the departynge he sayd. Olyuer I se my dethe
approche / syth that I delyuer the / and I haue well
deserued it. Neuertheles yf prayer maye haue place. I
beseche the for to pardō me. Olyuer that was more sympler
than a mayden / sayd to hym. My frende that that
ye haue done to me / hathe ben withouten cause / for all yt
I promyse you that as for me I shall neuer tell no body
of the Iniurye that ye haue done to me / but & it be knowen
by other / & that some make you warre / I wyll not
helpe you. The kynge thāked hym and sayd that he wolde
abyde tyll than. They mounted bothe on one hors all
alone withouten other companye. And wente so moche
that they founde Arthur. ¶Olyuer knewe hym sooner
than Arthur dyde hym. Wherfore he set fote on grounde
and ranne to hym with stratched armes and embraced
hȳ. Who that hadde sene the knowlege of these two
faythful felowes / he sholde haue had a harde herte yf he
hadde not wepte. They helde eche other embraced with
out ony speche. Olyuer seynge his felowe that myghte
not speke / he had his herte sofull of Ioye and pyte that
he myght to nothȳge but kysse hym and colle hym. On
the other syde Arthur that sawe ye fayre face in whiche
the ladyes toke theyr solace for to beholde it so pale with
prysonynge where as he hadde ben in / hadde not lesse sorowe
than Olyuer. For all that he was the fyrst that spake
and sayd. My ryght swete lorde & felowe / this Iourneye
hathe ben fore desyred on my partye. I gyue louynges
to god that I haue founde you. A whyte knyght hathe
brought me hether / the whiche salueth you / & charged
me to tell it you. Olyuer answered hym. Arthur my
broder by your boūte & loyalte ye haue done so moche for

me / that I can neuer rendre you to guerdon. I praye
to god that he rendre you the rewarde / for I am not suffycyent
for to do it.

Englande. But afore that they were there ye maye well
thynke that they had dyuers wordes togyder / and eche
of them demaunded of others tydynges. Whan they came
in to Englande Olyuer shaued his berde to be ye more
gentyller But they wolde haue none other hors / but
that same that they were comen on / and cōcluded to tell
the trouthe of theyr aduenture / without declarynge the
place of his prysonemēt / and also without gyuyng ony
knowlege of whens they were / nor whome. And they of
Englande were all abasshed to se these two men vpon
one horse / & semblable. And sayd that Olyuer had broughte
one of his brederne frō saynt Iames / but they coude
not knowe whiche was Olyuer. Thus as

And soo as they deuysed Olyuer demaunded Arthur yf

comforte the kynge / and the lordes of the realme / and also
for to gyue helthe vnto Helayne his wyfe / the whiche
at that presente tyme was syke vnto the dethe / and that
he hadde made them for to byleue that he was Olyuer / 
Olyuer demaunded hym howe that he hadde gouerned
hym towarde his wyfe. And Arthur sayd to hym that he
hadde layne with her. And whā Olyuer these herde tydynges / 

he put out of remembraūce the seruyce that his
felowe hadde done vnto hym / and as hastye and full of
furour / he kest Arthur downe that was mounted afore
hym / so rudely without more enquerȳge / that he brake
one of his legges in fallynge. Then he lepte in to the sadell

sholde mysdo to gretely / seynge the loue that hadde ben
afore tyme bytwene them. And also y• grete seruyce that
he had done for hym / as to haue taken hym oute of that
place so full of myserye / from whiche he sholde neuer haue
departed yf he had not ben. Wherfore he cōcluded y•
for all these seruyces he wolde leue hym his lyfe / but this
was not but that he thought that he hadde done his wyll
with his wyfe / and gaue hymselfe meruayle howe that
in so noble a herte myght lodge so moche treason.

that he had doone vnto Arthur his felowe
without en cause. Capitulo. lxij.
            
               OLyuer rode longe in these thoughtes. And
whan he came to the courte / and that the
tydynges came to the kynge / and to Helayne
that Olyuer was comen agayne / they
were all abasshed / for they knewe well that
in so shorte a space as he hadde bē out that he coude not
haue ben there. Neuerthelesse they were ryght gladde &

               
Ioyous. And the kynge made hym grete chere whā he
sawe hym. But with payne he

he was so lene / and demaunded hym what sykenes he
had syth his departynge / and who had put hym in suche
estate. For as hym semyd he sawe neuer man so sore chaunged
in so shorte space. And Olyuer sayd to hym that
neuer syth his departynge he had had helthe. Fayre sone
sayd the Kynge ye be comen in to this countree for to
helpe you. And then he demaunded hym why he hadde
not ben at saynt Iames / as he had tolde them at his departynge.
Olyuer sawe well that his felowe had made
them to byleue at his departynge that he wente to saynt
Iames / wherfore he sayd. My lorde my malydye hathe

hathe letted me / and yf it please god / whan that I am
hole I may do it better with myn ease / and with gretter
company. whan it came after souper / he toke the sonest

and that of lōge tyme he had not sene her to whome
he coude none euyll wyll of ony thȳge that was happened
her / nor that his felowe had done. For he knowe wel
that she coude not do withall / and that ygnoraunce made
her for to do it thynkynge that it had ben he. whan he
was a bedde with his wyfe / he began for to colle her and
kysse her / wherof she was all abasshed & sayd. My lorde
ye haue forgeten the promesse that ye made to Saynt
Iames Olyuer demaunded her what it was / and how
quod she / doo ye not thynke on that ye haue layne with
me more than a monethe withouten touchynge of me / 
and that of all that whyle I myght not haue of you one

your vyage were done I haue herde you saye that ye haue
not ben there / and therfore I praye you my dere lorde
yf that ye haue promysed ony thynge to god / that ye

ferforthe / that he apperceyued the loyalte of his felowe
wherefore tenderly wepynge he withdrewe hym abacke
from his wyfe / and of all that nyghte he slepte not / but
sayd to hymselfe that he was the moost vnhappye / that
euer was borne of moder. And that the euelles and trybulacyons
that he had endured had not doone hym the
hondreth parte of dyspleasure that he had at that present
tyme And sayd that and his felowe had ony hurte / that

for to serche hym on euery syde / and as he wente heder / 
and theder / he herde towarde the wood a voyce that conplayned
hym ryght bytterly / wherfore he wente thederwarde.
And whan he approched nere there / he knewe y•
it was his felowe / that with ryght grete payne had with
drawen hym oute of the waye vnder a tree. And whan
Olyuer sawe hym he set fote on grounde. And truely he
had soo grete doloure that he myght not susteyne hȳself
And I thynke yf that god had not helped hym / that he
had fallen in dyspayre / and smyten hymselfe thrughe y•
body with his swerde that he hadde drawen oute. And
the fyrste worde that he sayd to his felowe was suche in
castynge hymselfe on his knees afore hym / with the naked

Arthur sayd ye / and prayed hȳ for to hye hym Olyuer
wente and made suche dylygence y• within a shorte space

this wyse he was brought to Lōdon sore syke / and Olyuer
was in it also for to bere hym companye. And made

this was done Olyuer made all the kynges physycyens
and surgyens for to come / the whiche put Arthur in poynt.
And they dyde so moche that within shorte tyme he

it was one of the meruaylous hystoryes that
euer he hadde herde / & sayd to Olyuer that
he coude neuer do hȳ so moche honour / but
that he ought to doo hym more / and also yf y•
he loued hym wel / he sholde do nothynge but that he oughte
to do. For neuer broder had done for another that y•
he had done for hym / wherfore he coude not to moche deserue
it. And that as touchynge his parte he wolde doo
hym as moche honour as sholde be possyble to hym / and
sente for his chamberlayne / and his mayster stewarde / 
and other gouernours / and commaunded them that suche
and semblable estate as his sone Olyuer had / sholde
be gyuen to Arthur. And began for to tell them all alonge
that y• whiche Olyuer had rehersed to hym / reserued
that he made no mencyon how that Arthur hadde layne
with his doughter / y• whiche was not a thynge for to recounte / 
for it was a desloyalte / but the kynge kepte hym
well from tellynge of it / bycause that there was / and is

kynges commaūdement all thynges were ordeyned as
he had deuysed. And dyuers knyghtes and squyres were
reteynēd of Arthurs housholde / the whiche began for
to gete vp / and the kynge vysyted hym ryght often. Also
dyde the fayre Helayne / that made no semblaunte of

Arthur was heled. And whan it came y• he myghte walke
aboute in the courte / and haue acquayntaunce with
the noble men that remayned therin / euery body began
for to loue hym / bycause of the humblenes that he was
replete with. And the kynge hymself loued hym almoost
as moch

wronge that the kynge of Irlande hadde done to his felowe / 
wherfore he demaunded hym on a daye yf that he
hadde ony wyll for to auenge hym. And Olyuer sayd naye / 
and sayd that he had perdōned hym. And how quod
Arthur haue ye so feble a courage that ye dare not auenge
you on your enemye / by the fayth that I owe to god / 
it shall not abyde soo. And then all euyll contente he came
towarde the kynge / & tolde hym all alonge in what
pryson Olyuer hadde ben in / and prayed hym y• he wolde
gyue hym men for to auenge Olyuer / for he knewe
well that Olyuer hadde no talente for to doo it. Whan y•
the kyng herde Arthur speke so / he toke it more greuously
at his herte than Arthur dydde / wherfore he sayd to
hym. My fayre frende lette my sone haue his wyll / for it
may be that he hathe made some promesses afore that he
yssued oute of pryson. Ye be well the man for to auenge
hym without ony more that he medle hym therof. And
then the kynge reysed vp a grete armye of y• whiche Arthur

and the kynge fledde / & was assyeged in one of his
places / that was not well garnysshed with vytaylles / 

wherfore it myght not holde longe. So whan he sawe y•
he had noo more mete / and that it was force for to yelde
hym / as a valyaunt man he sayd that he had leuer deye

of th fortresse in smytynge on theyr enemyes / and slew
many at the fyrste bronte / but there was soo many men
agaynst them that they coude not escape. And fynably
the kynge and all his men were slayne. After his dethe
all his realme yelded them / and were contente for to haue

            THese thȳges done Arthur and his company
retorned in to Englande / where as they were
fested of the kynge / of Olyuer / and of all y•
other lordes. And the kynge gaue Arthur the
realme of Irlande that he had 
                  •
               onquered of
newe. And the Irysshemen were sent for / the whiche came
and dyde hym homage & feate / wherby Arthur was
more puyssaunt thā afore / but this was not but that he
demaunded often of Olyuer what thynge dydde meue
hym y• he made hȳ not to be knowen / for then euery mā
               
               
wolde haue made hym better chere / and the kynge wolde
haue ben ryght Ioyous / for to haue maryed his doughter
so hyghlye. Notwithstandynge that it suffysed hȳ
Also he tolde hym how that after his departynge his fader
had neuer Ioye / and thought that angre hadde put
hym to dethe / wherfore Olyuer wepte ryght strongely
for the dethe of his fader / for hym semed yf that he were
deed / that it was for his sake / & prayed hym that he wolde
not as ye tell what he was / for it was yet tyme ynoug
                  ••
               
for to make them to be knowen / and that whan that
it sholde please them they myght do it. Arthur that wolde
all that his felowe wolde / dydde not dysobeye hym in

nothynge Also Olyuer made to bere more honour vnto
hym than to hymselfe / and pleased hym the moost that
he myght. Truely the two loyall felowes made so many
nowe thynges that all they of the realme reioysed them
Al theyr thoughtes was but for to make good chere and
Ioyous & that the whiche the one wolde the other wolde
also / and theyr two hertes were more agreynge thā
theyr semblaunce / that was all one thynge Thus as ye
here they passed the tyme in Ioy / but forture that is moder
of all 
                  •
               rybnlacyon had enuye of the goodnes of these
two loyall brederen and perfyte felowes / for in a shorte
tyme all theyr laughynges and Ioyes were chaūged
in to wepynges and lamentacyons / for Arthur was soo
greuously syke that the physycyens iuged hym but deed
but he was not so happy for to deye / at euery tyme that
he wysshed it. His sekenes was without comparyson of
all them that euer hadde ben sene / for in a maner of wormes
descended from his braynes / the whiche ete all his
face / wherby he was so strongely dysfygured / that there
was neuer man more. Out of his body yssued so grete a
stynke / that none myght approche hym saue Olyuer / y•
at euery thynge was aboute hym / and wolde not departe
fro hym. He sente for all y• maystres surgyens on euery
syde / and prayed theym yf that they coude fynde ony
remedy for his fayre broder that they sholde spare for nothynge.
And fynably none coude put no remedye to it / 
And this sykenes he
                  •
               de Arthur so longe that he was blȳ
               de.
Whan Olyuer sawe hym so blynde that he semed better
deed than alyue / he mayde ryght grete sorowe / so moche
that euery body hadde pyte on hym. Often Olyuer
sayd vnto Arthur / my broder yf there be ony thyng that
ye knowe that I may do for to helpe you / spare it not for

vpon my fayth I wolde be the poorest man in the worlde / 
so that ye had your helthe.

                & in lykewyse it semed to Arthur that his
helthe was in the power of Olyuer his felowe / and y•
he must do it for to hele hym. Capitulo. lxvj.
            
               MY broder and faythfull felowe sayd Arthur
ye doo me more good than I haue deserued
wherfore I thanke you / and pray you that
ye wyll pray to god for to sende dethe to me
for and it were his wyll I wolde fayne be
out of this myserye. ¶It happened that Olyuer slepte
vpon a nyghte / and dremed that it was well possyble to
fynde helthe for his felowe. And Arthur dremed in lyke
wyse that it was in Olyuers power for to hele hym / and
they had this vysyon foure dayes togyder / wherof Olyuer
was 
                  •
               ore ameruayled. He came to se his felowe and
declared to hȳ his dreme / and his felowe sayd that dremes
were but abusyon / notwithstandynge he tolde hym
that by thre dayes he had dremed / and hym thoughte y•
a thynge sayd to hym that he myght hele hym / and none
other. Olyuer sayd to hym wolde to god that it were in
my power for to hele you / for and I myght do it / ye sholde
be shortly hole / or elles I praye to god that he neuer
gyue me his paradyse. Whā it came to the nyght and y•
Olyuer wente to bedde / he sette hym on his knees afore
his bedde prayng our lorde yt he wolde gyue hym knowlege
of that vysyon / that soo often tymes had happened

hym. And with this that he wolde tell hym in what maner
that he myght hele his felowe. Then he layde hym
downe / and he was not soo sone a slepe but that a voyce
sayd to hym so hyghe that he awaked. Olyuer thy felow
may not be heled tyll that he drynke of the bloo
                  ••
                of two
Innocētes / sone and doughter / the whiche must be slayne / 
and theyr blode medled togyder / and thenne gyue it
hym to drynke / but he must not knowe of it whā he shal
drynke it / for and he knewe it he wolde not drynke it for
nothynge. Whan Olyuer herde this he was al abasshed
and thought for to haue resoned hym ferder forthe / but
the kynge was gone and sayd nomore. Helayne had herde
nothynge of all this. Upon the morowe he wēte to se
his felowe as he was accustomed / and axed hym how he
had done that nyght. Arthur knewe hym by his voyce / 
for he had lost his syght / and prayed hȳ for to approche
to hym. And whan he felte hym he enbraced hym sayng
My ryght swete broder ye be my dethe and my lyfe / for
a voyce hathe tolde me this nyght that it is possyble for
you to hele me / nor other thynge coude I not knowe. Olyuer
sayd to hym what he wolde well that it were so / &
then he departed fro thens / and after that he had herde
masse / he withdrewe hym aparte in to alytel chambre / 
and began for to thynke on that whiche he had herde on
the nyghte afore / then he sette hym on his knees before
an ymage of the gloryous vyrgyn Marye / the whiche he
had of custome for to salue / and began for to saye thus / 
Ryght gloryous vyrgyn Marye I praye the that by thy
pyte thou wylte counsayll this vnhappy. I haue my felowe
syke the whiche hathe done so moche for me that I
can neuer deserue it. It hathe ben sayd to me whether it
is by god or not / that who sholde sle two chyldren a sone

and doughter / and that theyr blode were medled to gyder / 
and that it were gyuen hym to drynke / that he sholdehele.
Ryght swete lady I haue two chyldren / a sone &
a doughter of kynges blode. ¶Neuerthelesse yf that I
knewe that I sholde not offende the hyghnesse of thy sone
and the / I sholde slee my two chyldren / for to rendre
to my broder his helthe.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer for to gyue helthe & guaryson to his
felowe / slewe his two chyldren for to haue the bloode
that Arthur myght drynke it. Capitulo. lxvij.
            
               
            
            
               
               WHā Olyuer had made thus his cōplaynte
to y• vyrgyn Marye / & that he had had dyuers
ymagynacyons / as well of the loue yt
he had to his chyldren / as y• whiche he had
to his felowe / he concluded for to slee his
two chyldren for the loue of his felowe / saynge 
                  •
               he hadde
nothynge more dere than his felowe / and that y• loue
that he loued his two chyldren with / was nothynge for
to compare to that the whiche he loued his felowe with / 
Wherfore he departed fro his chambre / and came in to
that of his two chyldren. And whan he was entred he cō
               maunded
all the ladyes for to auoyde oute / the whiche
dyde his commaundement. And whan he founde hymselfe
alone he shytte the chambre dore / and bare a basyn / 
and a naked swerde in his hande vnto the bedde of the
two chyldren the whiche slepte / and were not yet rysen / 
Whan he approched nere the bedde / he lyfte vp the couerlette / 
and founde them slepynge ryght swetely. The
lytell sone that was of y• aege of .v. yere awaked / and in
contynente as he sawe Olyuer / nature taught hym for
to make hym chere / and
                  •
                in smylynge named hym fader
The doughter that was the yonger neuer lefte slepȳge
whan the sayd Olyuer sawe thē / he consydered whiche
of them two he sholde slee fyrste / & bycause that the sone
began for to speke to hym / he hadde soo grete pyte in his
herte that he recu
                  •
               ed abacke / & for all the worde he wolde
not haue smyten them / and then he sayd to hymselfe
How many nature fayle so moche for to suffre the fader
for to slee his chylde. Nor how may there be soo moche
cruelte in a man for to cōsente to murdre. Alas y• fayre &
good Helayne / what pyteous tydynges shall come vnto
your eeres / whan that ye shall knowe y• I haue slayne

your chyldren / what shall ye saye. Certaynly your pyteous
herte may not endure it. And with that that ye lese
your chyldren / ye shal lese your husbande also / for he dare
not abyde in this realme for y• fere of your fader that
shall put hym to dethe / for he is well worthy. And certes
the 
                  〈◊〉
                beestes hathe more reason than I haue / vnto
whome nature dothe teche for to kepe theyr fruyte to
the dethe / and truely I ought for to resemble vnto them
I oughte to put me in peryll of dethe for to saue my chyldren / 
but thus it shall not go. And in saynge this he approched
to the bedde / and yet lyfte vp the couerlet agayne / 
and drewe hym by the arme and sayd. Unhappy chyldren / 
ye ought well for to curse your fader / and his lyf
whan he hathe engendred you and put you in this worlde
from whiche ye must departe. Thus saynge full dolorously
with the teres descendynge a longe his face / and
the swerde in his hande redy for to smyte / nature & reason
put afore hym that it sholde be to grete dommage / &
cruelte. And lyberalyte sayd to the contrary / that for to
rendre helthe to his felowe he coude not do to moche / y•
whiche he byleued / and in puttynge all feres behynde / 
with one stroke he smote of bothe theyr hedes / and then
he put the basyn vnderneth / and receyued as meche blode
as he myght haue / and thenne he layde them in theyr
bedde agayne / and the hedes in theyr places soo as they
hadde ben alyue. He toke a maūtell with the whiche he
couered it / and so bare it / in lockynge the dore after hym
and toke the keye with hym / to the ende that non

            ¶How Olyuer in a basyn of syluer brought the blode
of his two chyldren to his felowe / and made hym

               OLyuer all alone holdynge the basyn in his

and made to auoyde all them that were there / 
and then after he toke a lytell pot 
                  •
               ull of
the blode that was yet all hote / and gaue it
to his felowe Arthur for to drynke / that knewe nothynge
what it was. And the hystorye maketh mencyon that
as sone as he had tasted of it all the vermyne of his heed
fell of. And with this he keste oute all the vapours of his
body / in suche wyse that he felte hymselfe of all poyntes

heled / saue the flesshe that was eten of his vysage was
not so sone comen agayne. But Olyuer by thre or foure
tymes wasshed it / and gaue hym the surplus for to drȳ
               ke
so moche that he had agayne his syght and his helthe
And whan Arthur felte hymselfe heled / he kneled downe
for the kysse the feete of his felowe. And Olyuer that
was gladde of the guaryson and helth of his felowe sayd
to hym. My frende gyue thankynges to god / and after
to my chyldren the whiche I haue slayne for thy helthe / 
And to the ende that thou byleue it the better to there y•
basyn that is yet all blody of theyr blode. Arthur herȳge
and seynge this meruayll / hadde so grete abhomynacyon / 
and was soo meuyd at his herte / that with payne it
can be specyfyed / and sayd to hym. ¶Ha ha Olyuer how
may there rest so grete cruelte and tyrannye in a mānes
herte as in thyn / that hathe slayne thy two chyldren for
me that am a straunge man / and nothyng of thy kynne
Truely I wolde be deed / so that it hadde not happened
so to the. Olyuer sayd to hym my frende I was theyr fader / 
and seynge that I haue put them to dethe / thou arte
nothȳge culpable / for it was not at thy request / wherfore
holde the contente. But my ryght loyall felowe there
is another thynge / for it is nedefull that the departȳ
               ge
of vs twayne be made. Wherfore I recommende my
wyfe vnto the / and praye the that thou wylte comforte &
helpe her. For I knowe well that she shall haue grete nede
of helpe whan she shall knowe that the whiche is happened.
All the golde of the worlde sholde not kepe me yf
the kynge knewe it. Wherfore it is force for me for to departe / 
and go in to suche a place where neuer tydynges
shall be herde of me / and where as I maye serue god al
y• remenaunt of my lyfe for to purge my vyces & synnes

whyles that Olyuer spake to his felowe / the lady that
had the kepynge of the two chyldren had bē at Helayne
and complayned her strongely of that / that she knewe
not in what estate the chyldren were / and excused her saynge
that and there came ony euyll to them / that it was
by the sayd Olyuer.
         
         
            ¶Of the grete myracle that god dyde to Olyuer for
his loyalte / in reysyng his two chyldren to lyfe that he
hadde slayne. Capitulo. lxix.
            
               OLyuer thought that it sholde be a thȳge in
humayne for to se his two chyldren by heded / 
wherfore he wente in to the chambre
where as they were / for to haue put them
in a place where neuer tydynges sholde haue
ben herde of them. And this wolde he do afore his departynge.
Whā he had lyfte vp to the couerlet / he opened
the wyndowe that was shytte for to se them more playnly / 
and then he came towarde his chyldren with y• teres
in his eyen / and in castynge his regarde on them / he apperceyued
that they hadde lyfe / and played bothe togyder.
¶Whan Olyuer sawe this myracle / for pure Ioye
he fell in a swowne to the erthe. And whā he was arysen
he enbraced and kyssed them a .M. tymes / and thēne he
sayd. ¶O innumerable puyssaunce of god that no man
can comprehende I rendre vnto the praysynges & thankes / 
of the goodnes that thou hast done to me poore synner / 
in shewynge thy grete pyte and mercye. He toke his
two chyldren in his armes and lapped them in a clothe

all blody. And the fyrste that he encountred was his felowe.
Arthur to whome he sayd. Broder reioyse the / goo
and se the kynge / and do so moche that he folowe me to
the chyrche that I go to. In lyke wyse my wyfe and all
them of the courte that ye may fynde. Then Olyuer passed
forth
                  •
                all alone thrughe the stretes / and he dydde soo
moche that he came to the cathedrall chyrche of Poules
where as he commaunded that all the belles sholde be
rongen / to the ende that all manere of folke sholde come
theder. He mounted on hye for to be herde of euery body
And then he began for to saye whan he sawe that the kynge
was comen / and that the chyrche was full of folke.
Ryght puyssaunt kynge of Englande thou hast maryed
thy doughter to a man vnknowen / for ye knowe that I
neuer reherced to you of my lygnage / notwithstandyng
thynke that my condycyons be not so hye and soo vertuous
as they ought to be / and that apperteynethe to my
lygnage / the whiche is ryall / for I am sone of a kynge
and of a quene / and at this presente tyme kynge of Castyll.
But neuer syfh the decesse of my fader / and that the
realme is fallen to me I haue not bē there But my wyll
is nowe for to getheder / and make me to be crowned kȳ
               ge
and my wyfe quene. Wherfore I beseche you noble
kynge that ye wyll accompany me and youre daughter
theder / for it is reason that I retorne better accōpanyed
than I came forthe. Notwithstandynge that I had taken
leue of the ryghte puyssaunce Kynge of Algarbe / 
my faythfull felowe that is there. I lefte hym a lettre by
the whiche I prayed hym that yf he sawe the water of a
glasse that I had lefte hym chaunge his coloure / that he
sholde put hym in quest after me / for I sholde than haue
nede of helpe. He forgate it not / for he loked so moche

that he sawe it chaunge / and it was at the houre that I
was taken in Irlande. Whan he apperceyued it / he that
is a kynge redoubted / and regente of Castyll in abydynge
of my retorne / hathe habandonned landes and possessyons / 
and all other thynges for my loue / and all alone
without ony company put hym on the waye / and made
auowe to god that he sholde neuer rest tyll that he hadde
herde tydynges of me.
         
         
            ¶How Olyuer afore the kynge of Englande and the
other barons of the realme / tolde his ad
                  •
               entures and
meruaylous fortunes. Capitulo. lxx.
            
               AFter Olyuer began for to recoūte all the aduentures
of Arthur / as well of them of the
forest / as of y• other / and how that he hadde
foughten with the kynge of Irlande / & four
of his knyghtes that helde hym in pryson / &
dyde so moche by force of armes that he dyde vaynquysshe
hym / and slewe his men. And after sayd in this maner
contyne wynge by conclusyon. By the moyen of my
broder & loyall felowe Arthur I am delyuered from the
place where as I sholde neuer haue yssued out. And in
guerdon of all these thynges I broke one of his legges.
Now it is happened after all these thynges that he hath
had a meruaylous sykenes / not foure houres ago. And
so as I desyred some thynge y• myght hele hym. It happened
me to haue a vysyon / and was tolde to me yt who
that wolde gyue hym a drynke of the blode of two Innocentes / 
sone and doughter medled togyder / that he sholde
haue helthe. So it is happened for to gete hȳ helth yt
               
with this swerde I haue slayne my propre chyldrē / and
byheded them for to rendre to hym his helthe / the whiche
he hathe / wherfore I gyue thankynges vnto our sauyour.
And after that I sawe hym heled I thought for
to haue departed from this realme. But yet I came in
to her chambre for to se my chyldren that I had slayne / 
the whiche by the wyll of our lorde that hathe extended
his grace / and pyteous mercy on me poore synner / hath
founde them alyue / and playnge the one with the other
Wherfore faders and moders that hathe chyldren / thynke
in what doloure I was in whā I put them to dethe
And what Ioye that I haue herde whan I se thē reuyued.
Then he toke his two chyldrē and afore all the people
shewed them alyue / lapped in the clothe that was all
bebledde of theyr blode. Wherfore all they that were the
represent / were mouyd with inwardly pyte / that with
wepynges and lamētacyons they made a grete bruyte
The kynge wepte for grete Ioye and pyte. The poore
Helayne that sawe her chyldrē so / myghte not supporte
herselfe but fell in a swowne. And whan she was comente
herselfe / she came to her chyldren in shewynge to thē
moderly loue / & she coude not be fulfylled with kyssynge / 
and pyteous remuneracyon. Bryefely it was a pyteous
thynge for to be in that chyrche / for some wepte for
Ioye and the other for pyte. And whan the sorowe was
a lytell aswaged the kynge al wepynge came and enbraced
Olyuer saynge. ¶Noble kynge blessyd be our lorde
whan he hathe gyuen me the puyssaūce for to mary my
doughter so nobly / as to a kynge that is extracte of so noble
a lygnage. Ye recoūte vnto vs y• moost meruaylous
tale that euer was herde in ony countree. And ye maye
well ymagyne that they that shall here it after vs shall

saye thus for for euermore the compaynye of you and of
your broder as lōge as the worlde shall endure ought to
be recounted for the not semblable that euer was herde
or that shall be.

they beganne for to make Ioyous feestes in
welcomynge the kȳge of Castylle that was

and ladyes of his countree. And helde one of the gretest
feestes that euer he had made. Olyuer prayed theym all
that they wolde accompanye hym in to Castylle to be at
his coronacyon. And they accorded hym all / and the kynge
hymselfe sayd that he wolde go with hym / and Olyuer
thanked hym. And after prayed the kynge of Algarbe
his felowe that he wolde do soo moche as to goo in to
Castylle for to denounce his comynge. Arthur sayd that
he wolde do it gladly. He departed from Englande well
accompanyed / and dyde soo moche that they arryued in
Castylle / where as he tolde the comynge of the kynge / &
of his wyfe the kynge of Englandes doughter. Whan y•
tydynges were denounced that, he was comē / and that
Olyuer came after / euery body thanked god / and apparaylled
them for to receyue hym in the moost honourablest
wyse that they myghte. They of the realme assembled
them / and by counsayll ordeyned for to make feest▪
from the fyrste towne of the realme where as he sholde
entre / vnto the laste that he sholde passe by. And all at y•
expence of the realme. Whan Olyuer thought that his
felowe myght be well in Castyll / he made that the kȳge
was contente to departe. And departed from London
the fayrest / and the moost noble companye / and the best
in poynt that euer was sene vpon a daye. Helayne was

accompanyed of ladyes and damoyselles in suche wyse
that it was grete pleasure for to beholde theym of theyr
Iourneys I can not deuyse to you / but they dydde soo
moche that they arryued in Spayne / where as they were
feested of all the grete lordes that they passed by. And
whan they approched nere Castylle. Arthur and all the

ryght gracyouslye / and Ioyously in thankynge god of
theyr comynge. Then they made reuerence to theyr lorde / 
& to theyr newe quene also. The whiche semed them
the fayrest lady that euer they had sene. Also they salued
the kynge of Englande in offrynge them to his seruyce / 
And whan they were entred in to the fyrst towne of the
realme / the stretes were hanged / & pagentes vpon scaffoldes / 
and there was soo many other playes that they
wyst not y• whiche they myght beholde. The ladyes were
in the wyndowes soo rychely clothed that it was meruayll.
And whan it came that they entred in to the prynces
place / all that they had sene afore was nothynge to

               ruayle. And fynablye in all the
townes that they passed by they founde newe thynges
and alwaye better and better. From the begynnynge of
the realme all the companye were at the good Olyuers
expences. In that estate they came vnto the cyte of Vaudolytys / 
where as they founde the olde quene of Castyll
Olyuers stepmoder / & Arthurs owne moder / the whiche
at the request of her sone Arthur / was comē oute of
the realme and countree of Algarbe for to saye vnto the
fayre Helayne that was newe quene / that she was welcome / 
and to Olyuer semblably. Also in that same Cyte
was the moost ryalte as in the pryncypall cyte. ¶And

whan it came that they were descended at the palays / y•
quene Arthurs moder came agaynst them strongely accompanyed
with 
                  •
               adyes and damoyselles / & welcomed
the newe quene / & also y• kynge of Englande her fader.
And on y• morowe Olyuer was crowned / & he layne also

                / the kynge of Algarbe / & the two other quenes
were set at one table / & all .v. were crowned.
         
         
            ¶Here it deuyseth how the kynge and y• other lordes
and ladyes dyde departe. And how y• whyte knyght
appered to Olyuer / and oppressed hȳ for to holde his
promesse / whiche was for to gyue hym y• halfe of his
wynnynge bycause of the torneyment. Ca. lxxij.
            
               
            
            
               
               AFter these thynges and that the kynge of Englande
hadde ben there by the space of two
monethes / he demaunded Olyuer yf that
he wolde not retorne in to Englande / and he
answered hym naye. And sayd that he was
more at his ease in his realme that had bē so longe without
a kynge / than for to retorne in to Englande. Then
the kynge concluded to departe / and Olyuer conueyed
hym out of his realme. And whan it came that they sholde
take leue the kynge of Englande sayd to hym. My sone
and my frende Olyuer I recōmaunde vnto you my
doughter your wyfe / and I pray you yf that I haue nede
that ye wyll forgete not me. And Olyuer sayd to hȳnaye / 
and that as often and as many tymes as he sholde
haue to do with hym that he sholde fynde hym redy.
And so they toke leue / and the kynge of Englande wente
towarde Englande / & the kynge of Castylle retorned / 
in to his coūtree / where as he founde his broder Arthur
kynge of Algarbe / y• whiche wolde retorne in to his coū

and ledde agayne his moder that tooke leue of the
kynge without makynge ony mencyon of ony thynge y•

and was delyuered of all straunge men / he vysyted
his realme / and made his ordynaunces soo fayre and so
good that euery body was contente. He with helde dyuers
lordes of the realme of Castylle of his courte / with
some of Englande that were abyden with hym. And as
he had ben there a whyle he was knowē of all the noble

strokes that it hadde almoost broken the dore. The
kynge awaked and demaūded what it was. That same
thynge answered open the dore & thou shalte se / or elles
I shall breke it. Whan the kynge herde hym speke soo he
put on his sherte / and toke his naked swerde in his hande
and came and opened the dore. It was not soo soone
open but that he knewe that it was his knyght / that at
his nede had alwaye socoured and seruyd hym. And yet
he was clothed in the whyte gowne that he hadde at the
houre that he departed fro hym. Whan the kynge sawe
hym he toke hym in his armes and sayd. My frende ye
be welcome. And he answered / welcome or yll come / yet
am I comen / and not for to tell you ony thynge that is
pleasaūt. The kynge sayd that he coude saye nothynge
that sholde dysplease hym / for he had good remēbraunce
of the promesse that he had made to hym / and was redy
for to holde it.

The kynge Olyuer hadde then all the thynges redy and

departed in two all that he hadde wonne and moore to / 
for the moost parte of his treasour proceded of the realme
of Castylle / and that and he had euer ony thynge of
that of Englande / he sholde be lorde of the Iust halfe as
he hadde promysed hym. The knyght sayd that he was
not contente and sayd to hym. ¶Kynge ye leye to me of
that whiche ye saye / for ye do not departe it so to me as
ye haue promysed. Haue ye not wōne wyfe and chyldren
The kynge sayd ye. Then sayd the knyghte I oughte to

hym on his knees / & prayed hym with Ioyned handes
that he wolde leue hym his chyldren / and that he wolde
gyue hym the halfe of his realme and with that y• resydue

he were contente for to take that the whiche her husbande
dyde ossre hym / by suche moyē y• the chyldren sholde

abyde to them. The knyght sayd to hym. Dame I wyll
do nothynge for you nor for none other. And yf that ye
wyll not do it / it is well in my power for to make you recompence
it full derely. Then the kynge commaunded
the moder for to fetche her chyldrē / the whiche she dyde

The knyght sayd naye. Now sayd y• kynge syth that
it gothe thus / chese whiche that ye loue best. The knyght
layd that he wolde haue the sone / bycause that he knewe
that he loued hym best. The kynge all wepȳge toke his

her that she wolde pardon hym her dethe. The good helayne
sayd that she wolde pardon hym with good herte
and then she embrased hym in saynge. Ryght noble kynge

that he wolde put her soule in the glorye of paradyse / &
that yf her lorde had done ony synne for to slee her / that
he wolde pardon hym. And whan she had ended her prayers
and sayd her orysons / she came towarde her lorde

            ¶The epylogacyon of the booke. The last Ca.

               den & knowē
more dystynctely / for y• whiche cause the table
hathe ben made and put in the begynnȳ
               ge
of this presente boke for to vnderstāde it
y• better. And bycause that it sholde seme to dyuers y• some
passyues of thystorye by symplytude of impossylyte
ought not to be byleued for a trouthe / for the meruayll y•
is sayd. To the declaracyon of the passages of thystorye
by maner of epylogacyon this laste chapytre is c
                  •
               mprysed.
And to the regarde of Olyuer and Arthur that were
so lyke / the dyffyculte is not to grete / for whan y• two
chyldren be of one aege / and of one felte complexc
                  •
               on hauyng
some symylytude of vysage / & corsage / facylly one
may be taken for another / namely bycau
                  •

togyder / spekynge all one langage clothed in sē
               blable
clothes / instructe vnder one mayster / holdynge

and kepynge all one maner of doynge and countenaunce / 
all this rogyder / and dyuers other thynges make the
them be sayd semblable.
            ¶To the regarde of the quene that was esprysed of the
loue of Olyuer / it was but fragylyte naturall of women
that foloweth sensualyte agaynst honoure.
            ¶Touchynge y• water of the glasse that ought to

               roub
                  •
               e
at Olyuers daunger / by this ye must not vnderstande
that it was water elementall in his nature / but bycause
that Olyuer was all vertuous / & that his vnder
standynge was all gyuen to good / and to loue god / perseuerynge
in good and vertuous operacyōs / and fleynge
all vyces and synnes / god permysed that Arthur had
knowlege of y• aduersytees happened to Olyuer his felowe
by the chaungynge of the water of the sayd glass
                  •
                /
by the prayer of his felowe Olyuer made vnto god / euē
so as he had wryten in the lettre / and all this to the ende
that of them were memorye afterwarde / for to knowe
the puyssaunce of god / and the meruayles that on them
he wolde shewe / as on his frendes & good crysten men / 
and 
                  •
               or to gyue example vnto the other.
            ¶Almoche as it toucheth of the fortunes happened vnto
Olyuer and Arthur / as well on the see as on the lāde
it is but a thynge naturall / and of semblable happeneth
often by the dysposycyon of the weder / but that whan y•
they were presetued from deth / that was y• wyll of god / 
and thynges myraculous that were shewed on them.
            ¶To the regarde of the whyte knyght that appered so
to Olyuer / and gaue hym comforte and ayde in his nedes / 
god had sente hym in rewardȳge hym in this worlde
of y• grete goodnesse and werkes of myserycorde that
he hadde accomplysshed in procurynge the absolucyon

of that same knyght that was holden for accursed.
            ¶Where as it toucheth that Olyuer was taken by one
of the kynges of Irlande / and retayned prysoner / and
after delyuered out of pryson by Arthur / god caused all
this / to the ende that the kynge of Irlande that vniustely
and without cause was enemye of his her
                  ••
                and traytour / 
for alredy by iust warre he had made to hym homage / 
and to the kynge of Englande / the whiche put hȳ
in his realme agayne / abode not vnpunysshed in this same
worlde of his euyll and traytourous wyll / to the ende
that all traytours take ensample by hym / and kepe
them from falsynge of theyr othe.
            ¶To the regarde that Arthur coude not be heled but yf
he dranke of the blode of two Innocentes / sone & doughter / 
god had done it and gyuē it to vnderstande by reuelacyon
for to preue y• loyalte and true loue of these two
felowes / as we rede of Abraham that was contente for
to make sacrefyce of his soue Ysaac vnto god / in lyke wyse
Olyuer was soner cōtente to hele his felowe by sleynge
of his chyldren / than for to se hym deye / and it maye
be that his chyldren were deed / and after reuyued / or elles
that god couered the murdre and semed to Olyuer
that they were deed / soo as it semed to the Iewes that
Moyses had hornes / yet had he none.
            ¶And asmoche as it toucheth that Olyuer was contē
               te
for to slee his wyfe the quene for to kepe his promesse
vnto the whyte knyght Syr Iohan Talbot / to whome
he hadde promysed the halfe of his wynnynge at the torneyment / 
he was so grounded and resolued in loyalte y•
of his promyse he coude not nor durst not excuse hym.
As we haue of kynge Herode y• loued of saynt Iohā baptyst / 
but yet he wolde kepe his promyse to his doughter

and make hym to be byheded / than to fayle and breke y•
fayth of his othe. ¶And bycause that to god is nothynge
impossyble / he hathe done for oure doctryne dyuers
myracles that ben worthy of memorye perpetuall / as y•
hystorye specyfyeth here afore / made to ye praysynge of
god and of his gloryous moder / and to the honour of the
noble mē / and to the felycyte of all loyall & true louers.
to the example of pacyentes / to the hope of the cheualrous / 
and to the ferrylyte and occupacyon of the tyme
salutarye. Amen.
