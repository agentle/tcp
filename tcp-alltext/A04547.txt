            TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE SIR EDWARD BARKSHAM, KNIGHT, Lord Maior of the City of London; and to the right Worſhipfull, the Shriefes and Aldermen his Brethren.
            
               THe very Arts (Right Honorable and Worſhipfull) which were wont to beare the attributions of [honeſtae & liberales] ſeeme now to temporize, and to haue learned the new-found skill of equiuocation. For, howſoeuer the former of theſe denominations adhereth cenſtantly vnto the Profeſſors of Mathematick Sciences, yet the other, which was once deriued [a liberalitate] and then intimated, that they were

anciently accuſtomed to performe liberall recompence to their louers and followers, hath now (to ſpare coſt) purchaſed a different etymologie [a libertate] as properly accommodate to ſuch as are [liberi] freeborne, or (as our peculiar terme carrieth) Free-men. Which being ſo, and ſeeing that in this particular, as well as in many other of greater conſequence, Tempora mutantur—: I am thereby enforced to make vp the old verſe, adding—e

Which is the cauſe that I preſume (without farther ſelfe-praiſe, of what I haue brought more vſefull, more eaſie, or more certaine and delightfull in the operations, then hath been ſeene before) to preſent my Labours to your Hononrable and Worſhipfull iudgements, to whom I owe of

dutie, whatſoeuer can be of mee performed, to the furtherance of Art, and the honour of this noble Citie, and the worthie Companies therein.

            THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.
            
               GEntle and Curteous Reader; hauing for many yeares paſt ſpent my time both in reading, practiſing, and conferring with others in, and about the ſtudie of the Mathematicall Sciences, and through great paines and trauell, at the requeſt of diuers Worſhipfull Gentlemen. Merchants, and others of my very louing friends, haue at laſt collected and gathered together many excellent Rules and eaſie Abreuiations in the Science of Arithmatick, which at the entreaty, and by the meanes of the helpe of ſome of them, I haue at laſt made bold heere to preſent abroad vnto the worlds view, the firſt fruites of ſome idle houres ſtudie, the moſt part whereof I doe acknowledge to haue gotten by the practice and vſe of the moſt excellent Inſtrument, inuented by Maſter William Pratt, called, The Iewell of

Arithmatick in which I haue done the beſt of my Indeauours, not to hide that Tallent in the earth, which God hath beſtowed vpon me for the benefit of others, but rather to his great glory and prayſe, and for the benefit of my Country, and for the furthering of all that are ſtudious in the Art of Numbers, I haue laboured to ſet it forth in the moſt briefe, plaine, and eaſie manner that I could fit for the vnderſtanding of the weakeſt and meaneſt capacitie. In which if any thing ſhall ſeeme obſcure or doubtful to any man, I could wiſh my ſelfe were preſent to reſolue his doubts, for I haue indeauoured to make the Rules as briefe, ſhort and eaſie, as I could deuiſe.
            In my firſt Book I haue intreated concerning vulgar Arithmatick, with new inuentions of my owne, in all the firſt foure parts of Arithmatick, viz in Addition and Subtraction, with two ſeuerall kinds of Multiplication, not charging of the memory, neuer extant before in any Author that I haue read, with foure ſeuerall kinds of Diuiſion, the latter of them bringing the proofe by Addition of the figures vnder the diuidend, without any multiplication, or caſting away of nines, according to the accuſtomed manner.
            
               Againe, in the worke of Fractions, I haue ſet them forth in plaine and perfit figures after another manner of my owne inuention, becauſe the fractionall figures in moſt bookes of Arithmatick were ſo vnperfit, that they were ſcarce to be deſcerned, and in this manner they will performe all factionall operations, as well as if they were ſet out according to the vſuall manner. In the end of which Rules I haue ſhewed the reaſons and proofes of fractions by the known parts of Coyne.
            Thirdly, in the ſecond part of the former booke, I haue ſet forth Reduction, both in Coyne ſterling `waights, meaſures, time and motion; the Tables whereof are in the firſt part of the book, with diuers Rules how to bring pence, or farthings at the firſt worke into pounds, ſhillings and pence; with diuers queſtions wrought by Reduction, with Progreſsion Arithmaticall and Geometricall, with examples.
            And laſtly, I haue ſhewed how to worke the Rule of 3 Direct and Conuerſt, both in whole numbers and fractions, after diuers ſeuerall manners of workings, and how to find the diuiſor in any queſtion, as alſo diuers wayes to worke Fellowſhip, Barter,

Exchange, Allegation, Intereſt, Poſition, and all other operations Arithmeticall, with examples and briefe Rules of euery part.
            In my ſecond booke of Decimall Arithmatick, I haue firſt deſcribed out the parts and vſe of the decimall Table, and how to ſet forth any number giuen in Decimalls.
            Secondly, I haue ſhewed how to worke all the ſeuerall parts of Arithmatick, viz. Numeration, Addition, Subtraction▪ Multiplication and Diuiſion in Decimalls; with examples and proofes of euery worke in the knowne parts of Coyne.
            Thirdly, I haue handled in as briefe manner as I could, the Rule of 3 Fellowſhip, Barter, Exchange and Intereſt in Decimall Arithmatick, as before in vulgar, in which you may perceiue the great labour that is auoided, in vulgar Arithmatick, with diuers examples and proofes of the ſame.
            Laſtly, I haue added a ſmall Treatice of Intereſt and Annuities; with the manner how to calculate Tables or Breuiats at any rate, or yeares purchaſe giuen; all which I haue drawne into a pocket vollume. If therefore any Gentleman, Merchant, or other, be deſirous to haue further inſtruction, if they repaire to my lodging in Coleman-ſtreet, I ſhall

be ready to giue them any ſatisfaction.
            If therefore I ſhall find theſe my labours and indeauors to take that effect, which I do hope and wiſh for, I ſhall be thereby the ſooner incouraged to haſten the comming forth of the third part of this volume concerning the extraction of Rootes, with many eaſie operations and rules ſhowing the vſe of the Square and 
                  •
               ubicque rootes, concerning Menſurations of land Timber, Board, Glaſſe and Stone, and the reduction of Meaſures from one proportion to another by their ſquares giuen: and laſtly, concerning Millitary affaires and Gunners Art; concerning the Arithmeticall worke, with demonſtration by examples, which I had intended to haue ioyned to this vollume, but that it would haue increaſed it far beyond a pocket book. And ſo hoping of your friendly cenſure & acceptance of theſe firſt fruits of my labours, I ceaſe, hoping to haue my true indeauors and meaning well taken, and the faults in the Printing friendly amended, deſiring a bleſsing from God vpon theſe my poore labours, I take my leaue,

                        NVmeration is the firſt part of Arithmaticke, which ſheweth how to pronounce the value of any number of figures giuen; which are expreſſed by tenne figures, whereof the tenth is a Cypher, ſignifying nothing of it ſelfe; but being ioyned with figures, helpeth to increaſe the value: the figures are theſe;

                        How to expreſſe the value of a number giuen.
                        If a number be giuen, whoſe value is to be expreſſed, you ſhall vnderſtand, that the figure next the right hand is the leaſt in valew, and ſignifieth ſimply his owne valew, as the figure of 1 doth ſignifie but one, and the figure of 2 doth ſignifie but two, and the figure of 8 ſignifies but eight, and ſo of any other. And in the ſecond place towards the left hand, euery figure is in valew tenne, ſo that the figure of one there doth ſignifie tenne, the figure of 2 twenty, the figure of 8 eightie, and ſo of all other: in the third place towards the left hand, euery figure is in valew one hundred, ſo that the figure 1 in that place ſignifies one hundred, the 2, two hundred, &c. In the fourth place, euery figure is in valew one thouſand, ſo there the figure of one ſignifies one thouſand, the figure 2, two thouſand, &c. In the fifth place, euery figure is in value ten thouſand: in the ſixth place, one hundred thouſand; and in the ſeuenth place, one thouſand thouſands, or one million: in the eight place, ten millions: in the ninth place, one hundred millions:

in the tenth place, one thouſand millions, or one milliot; and ſo infinitely names may be giuen to the valew of euery pricke, as is vſuall in the ſecond part of Arithmetick, of Number, Square, Cube, ſurſolid, &c. or in Aſtronomicall Arithmetick, Primes, Seconds, Thirds, Fourths and Fifths, &c.
                        Now to expreſſe the valew of any number giuen, ſet a prick with the pen ouer the fourth figure towards the left hand, and ouer the ſeuenth, and tenth; and ſo ouer euery third figure towards the left hand, to the end of your figures, as in this Example:

                        Now begin and expreſſe the firſt foure figures towards the right hand, as if they ſtood alone, which are 2567, or two thouſand fiue hundred ſixty ſeuen. Then reade the figures belonging to the ſecond prick, which are 430, as if they ſtood alone thus, foure millions three hundred two thouſand fiue hundred ſixty ſeuen: then take the three figures belonging to the third prick, which

are 635, or ſixe millions three hundred fiftie foure millions three hundred and two thouſand fiue hundred ſixtie ſeuen: and ſo this whole ſumme is thus to bee read, two hundred thirty ſeuen thouſand eight hundred fifty ſixe milliots three hundred fiftie foure millions three hundred and two thouſand fiue hundred and ſixty ſeuen; and ſo of any other ſumme.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. II. Addition.
                     ADdition is the ſecond part of Arithmatick, and ſerueth to adde or collect diuers ſummes of ſeuerall denominations, and to expreſſe their totall value in one ſumme.
                     In Addition begin to adde your ſums at the right hand with the ſmalleſt numbers or denominations firſt, and gathering of their totall mark how many of the ſmaller makes one of the next greater; as if your addition be Farthings, for euery foure farthings carry one peny in mind to be added to the numbers

in the place of pence, and for euery 12 put one ſhilling into the number of ſhillings, and for euery 20 ſhillings, one pound into the place of pounds; and therefore to know how many of the ſmaller denominations, makes one of the next greater: I haue here added in this place the ſeuerall Tables of Coyne ſterling, of Weights, of liquid Meaſures, and drie Meaſures, of long Meaſures, of Time and Motion; which are very neceſſary to be knowne of euery Practicioner in Arithmatick, before he proceeds any further in the practice of Arithmatick, being vſed in euery particular Rule of Arithmatick more or leſſe.

                        The explanation of theſe examples.
                        In the firſt example toward the left hand I begin with farthings, which are 3, which I ſet downe: then next 9 pence and 11 is 20, and 2 is 22, and 1 makes 23, and 2 makes 25, and 3 makes 28, and 11 makes 39 pence, or 3 ſhillings 3 pence; I ſet downe the 3 pence, and carry in mind the 3 ſhillings to be added to the place of ſhillings. Then adde the ſeuerall ſummes of ſhillings, which are 1. 1. 2 7. 8, the totall is 19, and the 3 in mind makes 22 ſhillings; ſet downe the 2 ſhillings, and keepe two tennes to be added to the tennes of ſhillings, which are 3 tens,

which makes 5 tennes, or 50 ſhillings; ſet downe the odde tenne to the 2 ſhillings, which makes 12 ſhillings, & carry 2 pound for the forty ſhillings to the next place of pounds, which are 5. 9. 6. 4. 7. 2. 4, and the 2 in mind makes 39; leaue the 9 vnder the place of vnites, and carry 3 tennes in mind, and 7. 5. 5. 5. 8. 2. 2, totall is 37; ſet downe the 7 vnder the place of tennes, and carry 3 in mind for the 30 tennes, which is 3 hundred: then 3 in mind, and 2. 8. 8. 3. 1. 2. 3, totall is 30; ſet a cypher, or 0 in the place of hundreds, and carry 3 for the 30 into the place of thouſands: then laſt of all, 3 in mind, and 3. 7. 1 makes 14 thouſand, and becauſe it is the laſt ſumme, you muſt ſet them all downe, placing the 4 vnder the place of thouſands, and the 1 one place more towards the left hand, and then the Totall ſumme of thoſe particulars will be 14079 pound, 12 ſhillings, 3 pence, 3 farthings, as appeareth in the example; and in the like manner is the other example to bee caſt vp into one Totall: and ſo I will here end with Addition of Coine, & put a ſeueral example of euery table for the full tables & perfect vnderſtanding of the ſaid table, which are of great vſe in all the ſeuerall rules of Arithmetick.

                        The Explanation.
                        In the Haberdepoyſe waight, 20 graines makes one ſcruple, 3 ſcruples one dram, 8 drams one ounce, 16 ounces one pound, 112 pound is one hundred of the Haberdepoyſe weight, wherby is ſold all kind of Merchandiſe vſuall in this Realme, and therefore in Addition of Waights Haberdepoyſe, for euerie 3 ſcruples adde one dramme, and for euery 8 drams one ounce, and for 16 ounces 1 pound, for 28 pound one quarter of a hundred, and for euery 4 quarters one hundred.

firſt, I begin with the drams in the firſt example to the right hand, which are 3. 1. 3, totall is 7 drames, which I note downe vnderneath, becauſe they are leſſe then one ounce. Secondly, the ounces are 3. 7. 2. 12. 8. totall is 32 ounces, or 2 pound, becauſe 16 ounces is one pound; which two I ſet vnder the place of pounds with a light touch of the penne for to remember it the better, and place a Cypher in the place of ounces.
                        Thirdly, the pounds are 2. 10. 1. 12. 10. 17 totall is 52 pound, which is one quarter of a hundred, and 24 pound, place 24 pound vnder the place of pounds, and put one quarter, as before in the place of quarters of hundreds.
                        Fourthly, 1. 3. 1. 2. 3 quarters, are 10 quarters, or 2 hundred and 2 quarters, or halfe a hundred; place 2 quarters in the place of quarters, and put ouer 2 into the place of hundreds for the 8 quarters.
                        Then 2. 7. 2. 7. 3. 8. 7 makes 36 hundred, place 6, and carry 3 for the 30: then ſay, 3. 1. 2. 1. 3. 1. 2, totall is 13; place 3 there, and carry one for the 10, which one in mind, and 1. 1 makes 3, which ſet downe, and the total is 336 hundred, 2 quarters, 24 pound, 0 ounces, 7 drammes; and ſo the other example

is in the ſame manner to be caſt vp, and ſo of all other.

                        The explanation of theſe examples.
                        In the firſt example of Coyne, begin your ſubtraction at the right hand, ſaying; 1 farthing from 3 farthings, leaues 2 farthings, which note downe vnder the 1 farthing. Then 10 pence from 11 pence, leaues 1 penny. Thirdly, 19 ſhillings from 17 ſhillings you cannot haue, therefore take one pound, or 20 ſhillings, and adde to 19 ſhillings, ſaying, 19 ſhillings from 37 ſhillings, reſts 18 ſhillings, which note downe. Then 1 that you borrowed, & 3 pound, is 4 pound from 6 pound, leaues 2 pound to ſet downe vnder 3. Then 8 from 8 leaues nothing, place there a Cypher, or 0 vnder 8. Then 5 from 7 reſts 2; then 2 from 9 leaues 7,

which alſo note againe; 9 from 8 cannot be taken, then make it 10 more, and ſay 9 from 18 leaues 9, which ſet downe: and laſt of all, 1 borrowed and 6 is 7, from 7 leaues nothing, and the worke is ended, and the remayner will bee 97202 pound 18 ſhillings 1 penny 2 farthings, as appeareth in the example before going.
                     
                     
                        The expoſition of the ſecond example.
                        Firſt, take 15 ounces from 10, which cannot be, then adde 1 pound, or 16 ounces to 10, makes 26; then ſay, 15 from 26 leaues 11 ounces, which note downe: then 1 borrowed and 24 is 25, from 27 pound leaues 2 pound remaining; then 2 quarters from 3 quarters, leaues 1 quarter remaining; then 8 from 7 cannot bee, therefore take 8 from 17, reſt 9, which note downe: then one borrowed and 3 makes 4, from 12 reſts 8, and the worke is done, and the remaine is 89 hundred 1 quarter 2 pound 11 ounces.
                        
                           3 Example.
                        
                        Firſt, take 59 minutes from 56 minuts cannot be, but then take 59 minuts from 60

minutes, or one houre, and there will remaine 1 minute, which adde to 56 minutes, and that will make 57 minutes, which note downe in the place of minutes: then 1 borrowed and 15 houres makes 16 houres, which taken from 20 houres leaues 4, which note vnder the 15; and then 2 dayes from 0 cannot be, but 2 from 10, and there will remaine 8, which note downe: then 1 borrowed and 2 makes 3, from 4 leaues 1; alſo 1 from 3 leaues 2: laſtly, 1 from 8 leaues 7, and 8 from 11 leaues 3; then 1 borrowed and 15 makes 16, from 16 leaues nothing, and the remayner will bee 37 yeares 218 dayes 4 houres 57 minutes; the like is done in the other example of Motion, and therefore here needleſſe to be rehearſed.
                     
                     
                        To ſubtract from a Vnite.
                        Set downe with your pen a vnite in any place, adding Cyphers vnto it, and the ſeuerall numbers which you will ſubtract from it of pounds, ſhillings and pence right vnderneath: then note what each ſeuerall number of your loweſt numbers doth want of 9 vnto the place of vnites, and ſet that right vnder for the remayner: and laſtly, note what your ſhillings and pence

doth want of 20 ſhillings, and ſet that downe for your remaynor, and the worke is ended.

                        The proofe of Subtraction.
                        The ſureſt proofe of Subtraction is made by Addition: for if you doe adde the numbers remaining, vnto the numbers deducted, they will returne your former Summe, if the worke be truly wrought, as wil appeare in the proofe of all the ſeueral examples before going, and therefore here againe in this place needleſſe to be rehearſed. Only I will adde one for examples ſake.
                        In the laſt example, the numbers which did remaine, were 767135 pound 2 ſhillings 9 pence, and the numbers deducted, 232864

pound 17 ſhillings 3 pence; theſe two numbers added together, ought to make a vnite in the ſeuenth place; wherefore I adde 9 pence to 3 pence, makes 1 ſhilling; and 1 ſhilling to 17 ſhillings, makes 18 ſhillings, and 2 ſhillings makes 20 ſhillings; then 1 and 4 is 5, and 5 is 10, which is one in the next place: then 1 and 3, and 6 is 10; and 1 1.8 makes 10, and 1.7.2 makes 10, and 1.6.3 is 10, and laſtly 1.7.2 makes 10, or one vnite.

                     THis Table of Multiplication muſt bee learned perfectly by heart, for to know readily what the multiplication of any two digit numbers vnder nine, or vnto nine doe make, and then Multiplication will be very eaſie: for Multiplication is a number of additions ſpeedily performed; as if you ſhould

ſay, How many in number is 8 times 7, if you ſhould ſet downe 7 eight times one vnder another, and adde them together, the totall will be 56: but if you looke in the Table for 8 in the head, and 7 in the ſide, you ſhall finde vnder 8, right againſt 7 in the the ſame paralell 56; or if you find 8 in the ſide, and 7 in the head, the like number will appeare, and theſe numbers in the table are to be fit in memory.

                        Firſt, I multiply al the figures of my multiplicand

by 7, the loweſt figure of my multiplier, ſaying, 7 by 8 is 56, put 6 vnder the 7, and 5 vnder the 8: then 7 by 6 is 42, leaue the 2 vnder 5 laſt placed, and ſet the 4 one place more towards the left hand vnder the 9: then 7 by 9 is 63, leaue 3 vnder the 4 laſt placed, and ſet 6 one place more to the left hand vnder 7: then 7 by 7 is 49, leaue 9 vnder the 6 laſt placed, and the 4, ſet one place more to the left hand vnder the 8: laſtly, 7 by 8, makes 56, leaue 6 vnder the 4, & place 5 one ſpace more to the left hand, as before, then cancell 7 of your multiplier, and the multiplication by the firſt figure is ended, and the worke will ſtand thus.

                     And this is the order of Diuiſion for one figure: but if your Diuiſor doe conſiſt of more figures then one, then you muſt take the firſt figure of your Diuiſor no oftner out of the Diuidend, then you can alſo take euery ſeuerall figure of your Diuiſor, out of the ſame figures of the Diuidend ſtanding aboue them, as for example.
                     If you would diuide 86824416 by 987, which was one of the products of the multiplications in the rules before going, for a triall of your former worke, then place your numbers, as in the example following.

                     Then I ſeeke how oft I may haue 9 in 86, I find I may haue it 9 times; but if I conſider the next figure 8 of my Diuiſor, I cannot haue alſo 9 times 8 out of the numbers remaining; if I take 9 times 9, which is 81, out of 86, there will remaine but 5; and then 9 times 8, the next figure of my diuiſor, makes 72, which cannot be taken out of 58 which will remaine; therefore I place 8 in the quotient, and by that I multiply all the figures of my Diuiſor, 987 makes 7896, which taken from 8682, leaues 786 aboue them: and the worke will ſtand thus.

                        The third Example of Diuiſion.
                        The ſecond kind of Diuiſion is this: firſt, place your diuidend & diuiſor as in the former Examples, & then hauing found out the figure of your quotient, begin with the leaſt figure of your diuiſor towards the right hād firſt, and multiply that by the figure of the quotient found, and then ſubtract the ſum of the multiplication of that figure from the figure aboue the ſame, if it exceed not 9; but if the product be aboue 9, then for euery 10

beare one in mind to bee added to the product of the multiplication of the ſecond figure of your Diuiſor by the quotient; and ſo in all reſpects worke for euery other figure, and you ſhall need make no more figures aboue your Diuidend then neceſsitie ſhall require, as for example.
                        I would diuide the product of the multiplication in the former Chapter of 79648039 by 8976, which was found to be as followeth, viz. 714920798064 by 8976: firſt, I place my Diuidend and Diuiſor as followeth.

Secondly, I ſay, 7 by 7 is 49, and 4 in mind makes

                            find 9 times; then I multiply 6 by 9 placed in the Quotient, makes 54, which taken from 60, leaues 6; place 6 aboue the firſt 0, and carry 6 for the 60: then ſay, 9 by 7 is 63, and 6 in mind makes 69, from 70 leaues 1, and carry 7 in mind; cancell the 0 ouer the 7, and place the 1 ouer the 0. Againe, 9 by 9 is 81, and 7 in mind is 88, which taken from 96, leaues 8 to bee placed aboue the firſt 6, and carry 9 in mind: laſtly, 9 by 8 is 72, and 9 makes 81, which taken from 86, leaues 5 to bee placed aboue the 6, and the worke will ſtand as followeth.

                     THe termes being 3, to find a third proportionall betweene two extreames: diuide the Roote of the greater by the leſſer extreame, and the quotient is your deſire.
                     
                        Example.
                     
                     Firſt, 8 and 12 are two extreames giuen, it is required to find a proportionall number

betweene thoſe two numbers giuen; ſquare 12, it is 144, which diuide by 8, makes 18 for the third proportionall number. Secondly, multiply your extreames together, and extract the ſquare roote for the meane proportionall, betweene two numbers giuen; as let 4 and 9 bee two extreames, 4 by 9 is 36, the ſquare roote is 6, for a meane proportionall number to thoſe two numbers giuen.
                     Betweene 2 and 54, let 2 meane proportionals be deſired by the ſquare of 2, which is 4; multiply 54, it makes 216, the Cube roote whereof is 6 for the leaſt of the two Meanes: Againe, by 2 multiply 2916, which is the ſquare of 54, makes 5832, of which the Cube roote is 18, for the greater meane proportionall ſought. But if the termes exceede 4, hauing all one exceſſe, it is then called Geometricall Progreſsion.
                     
                        To find any middle Terme, or any other Terme in a Geometricall Progreſsion.
                        Increaſe your Progreſsion by the exceſſe, and the ſquare of the terme when you ceaſe, or the number multiplied in it ſelfe ſquarely, is the double of your Terme ſaue 1, if the

progreſsion begin with an vnite.
                        But it the firſt terme be not an vnite, then the ſquare of any terme is the double number of the ſaid terme: as if you ſhould ſquare the ſixth terme, then the product would bee the twelfth terme: & ſo of any other terme.

                           h fower ſhooes vpon his fower feete (quoth he), you ſhall giue me for the firſt nayle (there being 28 in all) one farthing▪ and for the ſecond nayle 2 farthings, and for the third 4 farthings, and for the fourth 8 farthings; and ſo double at euery nayle, you ſhall haue him. Whereat the Gentleman ſmiled, ſaying; I will haue him. And ſo they bargained, and then went to an Arithmatician to caſt vp the Summe: but how this Gentleman was able to pay for this Horſe, ſhall appeare by the Worke, which I haue put for an example,

becauſe I would not haue any man ignorant in Arithmatick, to make any ſuch blind matches without aduice, as I know many haue done to their coſt.
                        
                           1. Example.
                        
                        Now according to the rule, I increaſe this progreſsion vnto the ſeuenth Terme thus, 1. 2. 4. 8. 16. 32. 64; which 64 I multiply by it ſelfe ſquarely, the product is 4096, which by the rule is the thirteenth Terme, which is one Terme leſſe then the double of 7: then multiply that 4096 by 2, it makes 8192, which is the fourteenth Terme. Then multiply 8192 by 8192, and the product is 67108864, which is the twentie ſeuenth Terme: the which being doubled, makes the laſt Terme 134217728.

                        The Extreames and Exceſſe of a Progreſsion giuen to find the ſumme.
                        Multiply the laſt terme by the Exceſſe, and from the Product abate the firſt terme, and diuide the remayner by a vnite leſſe then the exceſſe, and the Quotient is the ſumme of the Progreſsion deſired.
                        
                        
                           Example.
                        
                        In the laſt examples, the exceſſe was 2, by which I multiply 134217728, and the Product is 268435456, from which abate 1, the firſt terme, and the remayner is 268435455, which ſhould bee diuided by one vnite leſſe then the exceſſe, which is 2, and 
                              •
                            leſſe is but 1; therefore ſeeing 1 doth neither multiply, nor diuide, I conclude the price of the horſe to be 268435455 farthings; which I diuide by 960, the farthings in one pound ſtarling, and the quotient is 
                              •
                           79620 pound, 5 ſhillings, 3 pence, 3 farthings, the price of the Horſe, as in this example.

                     YOu ſhall vnderſtand, that in the worke of Fractions hereafter; in the next page following I haue vſed another forme of working, then heretofore hath been vſed: as when you will ſet forth any fraction, as ¾ thus heretofore vſed, ſet thē out thus, 3∶4; or ⅞, place thus 7∶8 with a double prick betweene them: and ſo of any other, as 25/20 of a pound, thus, 15∶20 of one pound: or fractions of fractions, thus, ⅔ of ¾ of ⅚ of a pound, ſet them thus, 2∶3 of 3∶4 of 5∶6 of a pound: and ſo of all other fractions, as ſhall appeare afterward in the operations following; and ſo being placed, they are more apter and fitter for al the ſeuerall operations of Arithmatick, then being placed after the ordinary forme of working. And thus much I thought good to expreſſe for the better vnderſtanding of the Rules hereafter following, in all fractionall operations. And now I will proceede vnto the ſeuerall rules of Fractions, with their Examples.

                           3∶4 of 2∶3 of 7∶8 of 1 li. makes 42∶96 of a li.

                           Multiply all the Denominators of your ſeuerall fractions for the new, or common Denominator to all your giuen fractions.
                           Then to find new numerators to each of your giuen fractions; multiply each fractions top into the baſſes, of each ſeuerall fraction, excepting his owne baſſe, for the new numerators, as in this Example.
                           
                              Example.
                           
                           If you would reduce 3∶4 and 5∶6 and 7∶8 of a pound into one Denomination: multiply all the baſſes together, ſaying; 4 by 6 makes 24, and 24 by 8 makes 192 for the common Denominator to all the giuen fractions.
                           Then multiply 3, the numerator of the firſt fraction, by 6, the denominator of the ſecond fraction, makes 18, & 18 by 8 makes 144 for his numerator.
                           Secondly, multiply 5, the numerator of the ſecond fraction by 4 and 8, the Denominators of the other two fractions, makes 160 for the new Numerator of the ſecond fraction.
                           
                              Thirdly, multiply 7, the numerator of the third fraction, by 6 and 4, makes 168.

                        In the firſt example of fractions of integers, there was 3∶4, 5∶6 and 7∶8 of a pound, reduced into one denomination, and the totall by Addition was 472∶192 of a pound. Now for the proofe of the worke, multiply the numerator 472 by 240, makes 113280;

which diuided by 192 the denominator, makes 590 pence; which diuided by 12. pence, makes 2 pound, 9 ſhillings, 2 pence. The proofe of this triall in the parts of a pound, take firſt for 3∶4 of a pound, or 15 ſhillings; then 5∶6 of a pound is 16 ſhillings 8 pence; alſo 7∶8 of a pound is 17 ſhillings 6 pence; and the totall added together, is 2 pound, 9 ſhillings, 2 pence, which prooues the worke to be true.

                           In the firſt example of fractions of fractions, the fraction was 72∶504, which was abreuiated vnto 1∶7 of a pound: firſt, take halfe the numerator 72, which is 36, then halfe the Denominator 504, which is 252; then 1∶2 of 36, is 18; and 1∶2 of 252 is 126. Againe, 1∶2 of 18 is 9, and 1∶2 of 126 is 63; then I ſee I cannot take 1∶2 of the remainer, wherefore I ſee I may abreuiate them by 3

ſtill, ſaying, the third part of 9 is 3, and 1∶3 of 63 is 21: laſtly, 1∶3 of 3 is 1, and 1∶3 of 21 is 7, which place thus, 1∶7▪ ſo that I find by abreuiation that 72∶504 of a pound, is one ſeuenth part of a pound.

                        TO worke by the Aliquot parts of a pound, ſearch in the firſt Table for your giuen price, and by that number found, diuide your number giuen, and the quotient is your anſwere in pounds, and the remayner is the fraction of one pound.
                        But if the giuen price be not found exactly at the firſt entrance, then find 2, or more numbers, to make the giuen price, and then worke as followeth.
                        
                           Example.
                        
                        If one yard coſt 3 ſhillings 4 pence, what will 7859 yards coſt at that rate: I enter the Table, and againſt 3 ſhillings 4 pence, I find 1∶6 of a pound; wherefore I diuide 7859 by 6, makes 1309 pound, 5∶6 of one pound, or 16 ſhillings 8 pence.

                        At 17 pence an ell Canuas, what will 3245 elles coſt: Multiply by 17, makes 55165 pence, which diuided by 4, makes 13791 Groats, and there will remaine one penny. Secondly, diuide that Quotient againe by 6, makes 229 pound, 8 primes, and the remayner is 3 Groats, or one ſhilling; and ſo the totall is 229 pound, 17 ſhillings, 1 penny.

                     IN this Rule of 3 Direct, there is alwaies three termes giuen, and a fourth required, and it is called the Goulden Rule, in regard of the excellency of this Rule aboue all others. The difficulty of this rule conſiſteth in the right placing of the three numbers giuen, ſet the terme next your right hand, whhereupon the queſtion is moued, and a terme of the ſame nature towards the left hand, & the third terme in the middle. Then multiply the ſecond nūber by the third, and diuide the product by the firſt, and the Quotient is the fourth proportional number ſought or deſired to be found out; whoſe denomination is euer like vnto the middle number.

If the number whereon the queſtion bee depending, be your Diuiſor, thē the anſwer is, by the conuerſe Rule, and you muſt multiply your two former numbers for Diuidend. If the firſt number be the Diuiſor, then the queſtion is anſwerable by the Direct Rule, and the product of the two latter numbers is your Diuidend.

                        If your three numbers giuen be all fractions, multiply the third by the ſecond, and diuide the product by the firſt, and the quotient will be the fourth proportionall number ſought for.

                        If all your three numbers giuen be fractions, multiply the Numerator of the firſt fraction by the Denominator of the other two fractions, for to make your Diuiſor. Then multiply the Denominator of your firſt fraction by the Numerators of your other two fractions, to make your Diuidend and then diuide by your Diuiſor, and the Quotient is the anſwere ſought: but if your Diuiſor bee greater then your Diuidend, then the Quotient is a fraction, leſſe then a vnite.

Multiply 3, the Numerator of the firſt fraction by 5 and 6, the denominators of the other two fractions, makes 90 for your diuiſor; then multiply 4, the denominator of your firſt fraction by 4 and 5, the numerators of your other two fractions, makes 80 for your diuidend: now becauſe your diuiſor is greater then your diuidend, place them fraction wiſe thus, 80∶90 of 1 li. or in leaſt termes, 8∶9 of a li.

                        This Rule differeth very little from the Rule of three; for in this Rule the ſumme of all the moneys disburſed, is the firſt number in the Golden Rule. Then the gaines or loſſe is the ſecond number: the third number is each ſeuerall partners money diſburſed ſo that the Rule muſt bee ſeuerally wrought for each ſeuerall Partners portion.
                        
                           Example.
                        
                        Foure Merchants made a company together; the firſt, viz. A. put in ſtock 74 pound, B. put in 90 pound, C. put in 100 pound, and D. put in 120 pound, and they found that they had gained 84 pound; now the queſtion is, what each man muſt haue of the gaines, according to the proportion of his money disburſed. Firſt, adde all the moneys disburſed into one totall ſumme, viz. 74, 90, 100, 120, totall is 384 for the firſt number in the Golden Rule.

                        The like reaſon is in loſſe, as is in gaines. Example: A certaine ſhip being in a tempeſt on the ſea was forced to caſt ouer board ſo much of her lading, as amounted vnto the ſumme of 642 pound, then there is great reaſon that all the ventures ſhould beare part of that loſſe, according to the proportion of his ſtocke which hee ventured. As ſuppoſe: A. ventured 700 pound, B. 530 pound, C. 640 pound, D. 800 pound; totall is 2670. Then ſay; If 2670 pound looſe 642 pound, what will each of A. B. C.

                        Foure Merchants bought a houſe together, which coſt 3000 pound; A. was to pay 1∶2 and 6 pound ouerplus; B. 1∶3 and 12 pound more; C. 8 pound leſſe then 2∶3; D 1∶4 with 20 pound ouerplus. Now the queſtiō is, what each Merchant muſt pay of this ſum. Anſwer: Firſt, the pounds ouerplus muſt be ſubtracted from the ſumme giuen; and the pounds wanting muſt bee added to the ſumme giuen; as for A. 6 pound, B. 12 pound, for D 20 pound, totall is 38 pound, to bee ſubtracted then; for C. adde 8 pound, therefore ſubtract 30 pound from 3000 pound, there wil remaine 2970 pound; then worke by the Rule of Fellowſhip, taking 12 for a number, which will bee diuided by all the denominators, 2, 3 and 4, viz. take for A. 6, for B 4, for C. 8, for D. 3; totall is 21 for diuiſor, the ſecond number is 2970 pound, the third, each mans part imagined.

                        To B 565 pound, to which 12 pound added, makes 577 pound, 5∶7

concerning this Rule, and goe in hand with ſome pleaſant queſtions to bee wrought by poſition, which is the moſt excellent Rule of all others in Arithmatick, as ſhal appeare in the ſecond part of this Booke in Decimall Arithmatick.

                        The Rule of Poſition requiring one number to bee imagined, before the principall proportion can be found.
                        TO worke by this Rule; Take any number at pleaſure, which you ſhall imagine to be the true number ſought, and proceed with it, as if it were the true number, wherein if you haue failed, by doubling or tripling according to the nature of the queſtion, you ſhall then attaine vnto the true number deſired, by aide of the Golden Rule, in manner following: for looke what proportion is betweene the falſe concluſion, and the falſe poſition, ſuch proportion hath the giuen number, to the number ſought.
                        
                           
                           Example.
                        
                        
                           A. B. and C. conſent to buy a ſhip, which will coſt them 2700 pound, ſo that B. muſt pay twice ſo much as A, and C. muſt pay 4 times ſo much as B: the queſtion is, what each man muſt pay of this ſumme? I ſuppoſe A muſt pay 8 pound, then B muſt pay twice as much as A, which is 16 pound; then C muſt pay 64 pound, which is 4 times as much as B: but yet 8 pound, 16 pound, and 64 pound, is but 88 pound, and it ſhould be 2700 pound, ſo that now I reſort to the Golden Rule, and worke as followeth. If 88 pound come of my Poſition 8 pound, of what comes 2700? Multiply 2700 by 8, and then diuide by 88, makes 245 pound 40∶88, or 5∶11 of a pound for the part that A muſt pay; then B muſt pay 490 pound, 10∶11 of a pound, which is twice as much as A; and C muſt pay 1960 pound, 40∶11 of a pound, which is 4 times as much as B. The totall ſumme is 2700 pound. Behold worke as followeth.

is 5∶6, which being taken from 6∶6, the whole ſubſtance leaues remaining 1∶6; therefore if 1∶6 be 40 pound, what is 6∶6? makes 240 pound.

                        A Merchant bought 384 yards of broad Cloth of three ſeuerall prices, of each a like quantitie, and he was to pay halfe as much more for the ſecond ſort, as he payed for the firſt, and twice as much for the third ſort as he payed for the ſecond: now the queſtion is, what each ſort coſt him, and at what price euery yard was rated vnto him? I ſuppoſe the firſt ſort coſt him 4 pound, then the ſecond ſort muſt coſt him 6 pound, which is halfe as much more as the firſt; and then the third ſort coſt him 12 pound, which is twice as much as the ſecond; the totall is but 22 pound, but it ſhould be 248 pound: wherefore if 22 pound come of 4 pound, of what number comes 248 pound?

                        The Rule of double Poſition.
                        SVppoſe a number at pleaſure, as in the laſt Rule of ſingle Poſition, and proceed as if you had found the right number, and if by working you find the true number, then your Poſition was the right number, which doth ſeldome happen. Firſt, if by your working there commeth out more then the true number; then note it thus + with a croſſe; if leſſe, then thus − with a long line, which doth ſignifie leſſe.
                        Secondly, ſuppoſe another number, greater or ſmaller, and worke as before, vntill you doe find the true number ſought; which if you doe not find, ſee the difference alſo from the true number ſought, and note it with the ſigne + or − as it ſhall bee found.
                        Then thirdly, ſet your ſuppoſitions with their errours, more or leſſe, as in the examples following.
                        Fourthly, multiply croſſe the firſt poſition

by the ſeconds errour, and the ſecond poſition by the errour of the firſt, and then if the ſignes be both alike + or −, abate the leſſer from the greater, and the remaines ſhall be the diuidend. Alſo the leſſer error abated from the greater, leaues the diuiſor▪ but if the ſignes be contrary one +, the other leſſe, add both together to make the diuidend, and adde the two errors to make the diuiſor: and laſtly diuide the diuidend by the diuiſor, and the quotient is the true number deſired.
                        
                           1. Example.

                        I ſuppoſe there were 12 Crownes in his purſe, to which if I adde one half; of 12, which is 6; and one third of 12, which is 4; and one fourth of 12, which is 3; and laſtly, one Crowne more, the totall will be but 26

Crownes, but they ſhould be 100 Crownes, ſo that this errour is two little by 74 Crownes, which I note thus:
                        74  −  12
                        Secondly, I ſuppoſe he had 24 Crownes, to which I adde 1∶2 of 24, which is 12 and 1∶3, which is 8 and 1∶4, which is 6: and laſtly, one Crowne ouerplus, the totall is 51, but it ſhould bee 100 Crownes, ſo that this is an errour of 49, too little, which I alſo note thus: 49  −  24

                        To anſwere this, or any other like queſtion, take any number for the price of a yard of the leſſer number, which here is veluet, which at 20 ſhillings a yard, leſſe 10 ſhillings, amounteth vnto 230 ſhillings. Now admit a yard of Sattin at 14 ſhillings, ſo 20 yards and 12 ſhillings amounteth vnto 292 ſhillings; from which ſubtract 230 ſhillings, reſts 62 s. more then the truth. Againe,

rate a yard at 12 ſhillings, ſo the 20 yards and 12 ſhillings makes 252 ſhillings; from which take 230 ſhillings, reſts 22 ſhillings more then the truth alſo. Now multiplying 22 by 14, and 62 by 12, the productes are 308, and 744, and the difference of thoſe numbers is 436; then take 22 from 62, reſts 40 for diuiſor, by which diuide the difference, makes 10 ſhillings, 9∶10 ſhillings for the price of a yard of Sattin.

                        Firſt, ſuppoſe he wrought 12 daies, which commeth to 12 ſhillings, then muſt the 8 dayes that hee played, come to 12 ſhillings at 18 pence a day alſo: but this queſtion ſaith, there came due to him 8 ſhillings? Behold an error of 8 ſhillings too little.

leaues 5 ſhillings, and it ſhould bee 8 ſhillings, which is an errour of 3 ſhillings too little.

The other hath ſugar of 12 pence a pound ready money, but in barter hee will ſell it for 14 pence a pound; the Queſtion is, how much Sugar will pay for 756 pound of Ginger? Firſt, put your price of your Ginger into pence, makes 9072 pence; which diuide by 14 pence, makes 648 pound of Sugar, which muſt be giuen for 756 pound of Ginger, at 12 pence the pound.

                        Take the 3∶4 of the intereſt, makes 191 pound, 16 ſhillings, 3 pence, 3∶5 of one penny, to ſell to gaine 18 pound in the hundred, for to giue 9 moneths time.
                        A Merchant ſold 300 quarters of wheat, coſt him 352 pound ready money, and loſt 7 pound in the hundred, what did one quarter coſt him, and at what rate did he ſell a quarter, to looſe 7 pound in the hundred? Take the intereſt at 7 pound in the hundred,

which is 24 pound, 12 ſhillings, 9 pence, 3∶5, which ſubtract from 352 li. makes 327 pound, 7 ſhillings, 2 pence, 2∶5 of a penny, and diuide the remainer by 300, makes 1 pound, 1 ſhilling, 10 pence for the price ſold: ſecondly, diuide 352 pound by 300, makes 1 pound, 3 ſhillings▪ 5 pence ob. for the price which it coſt him
                        Rie ſold for 3 ſhillings a buſhell looſeth 20 pound in the hundred, what will then be loſt, if it bee ſold for 3 ſhillings 6 pence a buſhell? If 3 ſhillings be 80 pound, what is 3 ſhillings 6 pence? Multiply 80 pound by 3 1∶2, or by 3 ſhillings, 6 pence, makes 2800; which diuide by 3, makes 93 li. 1∶3 Or otherwiſe, if 36 pence bee 80 pound, what is 42 pence? Multiply 80 by 42, and diuide by 36, makes 93 pound 1∶3 of a pound as before.
                        If in one ell of Cloth ſold for 3 ſhillings, 2 pence there were gained after the rate of 10 pound in the hundred, what did that ell of cloth coſt? diuide 385, or 38 penny 1∶2 by 110, makes 35 pence that the ell coſt.

                     THE SECOND BOOKE, CONTAINING A TREATISE of Decimall Arithmatick.
                     
                        The declaration of the parts of the Decimall Table.
                        
                           FIrſt, the Decimall Table in the left Margent containes certaine numbers in great and ſmall letters; firſt, from 1 farthing vnto one prime, or tenth of a pound, or two ſhillings. Then from one prime for euery ſhilling vnto one pound ſtarling, or 20 ſhillings.
                        Firſt, beginning in the left margent is

ſet downe one farthing in the vttermoſt paralell to the left hand, in the firſt paralell of the Table, and ſo continuing from one farthing to one prime, or 2 ſhillings; and ouer againſt euery number in the left ſide in a right line towards the right hand is contained the numbers in decimals, anſwering vnto euery farthing from one farthing to one prime, or 2 ſhillings; and in the vpper margent in the head of the Table is contained, the true denominations of the ſaid are all numbers in primes, ſeconds, thirds, fourths, fifths, ſixths, and ſeuenths, which are ſmall enough to worke any queſtion exact to a ſmall fraction of one penny in a ſumme of great value, as ſhall appeare by examples following. But here you ſhall note, that all the numbers in the ſaid Table cannot be exact and perfit.
                     
                     
                        To find the value of a Decimall fraction in the parts of Coyne.
                        Suppoſe the number giuen to bee 2 ſeconds, 4 thirds, 5 fourths, and 7 fifthes, and you deſire to know the true value thereof in coyne; ſet downe your numbers, as in the example following, and

marke your prime line, and then multiplie the fraction by 240, the pence in one pound, and the numbers that ariſe by multiplication ouer the prime line are the ſumme of pence, the value of that fraction giuen, and the remainer on the right hand of the prime line is the fraction of one penny.
                        
                           Example.
                           
                              〈 math 〉
                           
                        
                        Here by multiplication of 2457 fifthes by 240 pence, I find 5 pence is gone ouer the prime line, and there remaines 82080: 100000 parts of one penny. Now to know the value of that fraction in farthings, multiply the ſame by 4, and ſo many as goe ouer the prime line, are farthings, the reſt is the fraction of a farthing.
                        
                           

                           Example.

                        Numeration in Decimals.
                        If you haue a number to be expreſſed in Decimals of money, or Coyne ſterling, learne firſt by the Decimall Table how to expreſſe your Coyne, from one penny vnto one pound ſterling, or from one farthing to one pound ſterling, for which the Table going before was calculated. If you would know the manner how to calculate the ſaid Table; diuide 1 pound, adding 7 cyphers vnto it, by your part you would know how to ſet forth in Decimals: as if you would know how a farthing will ſtand in Decimals; diuide 1 pound with cyphers by 960, the number of farthings in one pound ſterling, and the quotient will be the numbers in Decimals, ſignifying one farthing.
                        
                           

                           Example:
                           
                              〈 math 〉
                           
                        
                        So that I find, that diuiding of 1 pound by 960 farthings, the Quotient is 1 third, 0 fourth, 4 fifths, 1 ſixth, and 6 ſeuenths: for if you ſhould haue proceeded, adding more Cyphers, the Quotient would haue been alwaies 6, becauſe I ſee the number remaining to be the ſame it was at the laſt, that is 64. And although a farthing cannot bee ſet out exact in Decimals, yet it will ſerue in Multiplication and Diuiſion: for in 10000 yards or ells, it wil not differ 1 penny, as ſhal appeare afterwards by examples in their places.
                     
                     
                        How to ſet out a penny in Decimalls.
                        Diuide 1 penny with Cyphers by 240, the number of pence in one pound ſterling, and the quotiēt wil be a penny in decimals.
                        
                           

                           2. Example.
                           
                              〈 math 〉
                           
                        
                        Here ſeeing that after I find the firſt quotient 6, and the remainer 16, as before I ceaſe Diuiſion, as needleſſe any further, knowing it will produce 6 in the quotient infinitely, and therfore I put as many times 6 in the quotient, as I find expedient and needfull, and 1 penny ſtands thus:
                        
                           
                              〈 math 〉
                           
                        
                        And theſe and diuers other numbers will not be ſet exact in Decimals, but yet they will ſerue to great purpoſe and exactnes in a multitude of queſtions, in ſauing an infinite labour in Reduction, and Multiplication and Diuiſion.
                     
                     
                        
                        How to breake a pound into his exact parts.
                        Set downe 1 pound thus, 10; then take the tenth, which is one prime, or 2 ſhillings, which I note thus,
                        
                           
                              〈 math 〉

                        It is alſo very neceſſary to vnderſtand the proportionall parts of a pound, for by them are many queſtions ſpeedily wrought in Decimals, as ſhall appeare in the examples of Multiplication and Diuiſion afterwards.
                     
                     
                        How to expreſſe the value of any number in Decimals.
                        Admit for example this number following, is to bee expreſſed according to the computation of Decimall Arithmatick, viz. 3785|725 thirds: then for the expreſsing the ſignification of that number in the knowne parts of Coyne, firſt, marke out

your prime line, to diſtinguiſh the whole numbers from the fractions with a right downe ſtroke with the penne, and then you ſhall find the numbers to ſtand thus 3785 pound, 7 primes, 2 ſeconds, and 5 thirds; which ſearch in your Decimall Table, and it doth ſignifie 14 ſhillings, 6 pence; ſo that the whole number is 3785 pound, 14 ſhillings, 6 pence, and ſo of all numbers; for you ſhall vnderſtand, that euery prime doth ſignifie in value 2 ſhillings, euery ſecond 2 pence and 2∶5 parts of 1 penny, and euery 5 thirds 1 penny, and 1∶5 of 1 penny: or ells euery prime is 1∶10 of one pound; euery ſecond 1∶100 part of one pound, and euery third 1∶1000 part of one pound, &c. infinitely.
                     
                     
                        How to remoue a Decimall number from one place to another.
                        If you haue a Decimall number giuen: as for example, 
                              •
                           3 pence, which doth thus ſtand in Decimalls, 1 ſecond, 2 thirds, 5 fourths; then you deſire to know how it will ſtand in the place of primes, pounds, or in the place of 10 l. or hundreds or thouſands.

remoue it one place towards the left hand, and it is 1 prime, 2 ſeconds, 5 thirds, or in knowne parts of coine 2 ſhillings, 6 pence. Againe, remooue them one place more towards the left hand, and it will be 1 pound, 2 primes, 5 ſeconds, or 1 pound, 5 ſhillings. Againe, remoue one place more: and it is 12 pound, 19 ſhillings: Againe, remoue it one place more, and all your fractions are in whole numbers, and will ſignifie 125 pound, &c.

                        And this Rule is very neceſſary to bee well and perfectly vnderſtood, for by it any price be giuen of a vnite in decimals. you may ſpeedily know what 100, or 1000, or 10000 will coſt at that rate, onely by adding of one, two, or more Cyphers.
                        
                           As for example, if one ell coſt 6 ſhillings 3 pence, what will 100 ells coſt at that rate? firſt, ſ
                              •
                           t out your price in decimals thus, 3 primes, 1 ſecond, 2 thirds, 5 fourths, and adding of two Cyphers, becauſe 100 hath 2 Cyphers, the ſumm will be 31|2500: and becauſe your fractions were fourths, cut off 4 figures and Cyphers towards the right hand, or marke your prime line, and you ſhall find, that 100 ells will coſt 31 pound, 5 ſhillings at that rate.
                        
                           1. Example.

                        If the numbers of the price giuen will not be exactly ſet downe in Decimals: as for example, at 7 pence, 3 farthings a yard, what will 100 yards coſt? Set downe your price as neere as may be, by your Decimall Table, which is 322916 ſeuenths, adde vnto it two cyphers, makes 32291600; and becauſe your fractions are ſeuenths, cut off 7 figures, and there will bee 3 pound, 4 ſhillings, 7 pence.

Then begin your Addition at the right hand at the leaſt Denomination firſt, and adde them all according to the Rule of Addition, as if

they were all whole numbers, alwaies hauing a care to marke out your prime line, and the totall of your Addition will ſhew you the iuſt value of thoſe whole numbers and fractions.

                        How to find the Prime line in any Diuiſion decimall, or to find the true denomination of of the Quotient.
                        In any diuiſion decimall, alwaies marke out your prime line in your diuidend with a ſtreight do vne line with the pen, then ſet your Decimall fractions in primes, ſeconds, thirds, fourths, &c. beyond the line; alſo do the like in your diuiſor, and then mark how often you may remoue your diuiſor, that the whole numbers of your diuiſor may ſtand vnder the whole numbers of your diuidend, and ſo many figures ſhall your quotiont haue in whole numbers, the reſt are to bee marked with prickes in the quotient for primes, ſeconds thirds, &c.
                        If you will diuide 938|61375 fifthes by 34 pound 35 ſeconds, then place them with pricks as in the example following. I find hauing placed my diuiſor vnderneath my diuidend, that I may remoue my diuiſor twice vnder the whole numbers of my diuidend, and therefore I conclude, the firſt two numbers of my quotient wil be whole numbers, which I marke from the reſt of the numbers in the quotient with a line, and

then diuiding according to the former inſtruction, you ſhall find the quotient will bee 27 pound, 3 primes, 2 ſeconds, and 5 thirds.

As if you will diuide 13 pound 95 ſeconds by 45; or which is all one if you ſhall ſay; if 45 pieces of figgs coſt me 16 pound, 19 ſhillings, what did one piece coſt? Diuide 13|95 ſeconds by 45, makes 31 ſeconds, or 6 ſhillings, 2 pence, 2∶5 of a penny for the price of one piece. And in this ſort the price of any number of yards, ells, or pounds being giuen in diuiding it by the number of yards, elles, or pounds, the quotient will bee the price of one; and by this Rule you ſaue a labour of Reduction, alwaies diuiding the price by the number giuen, the greater by the leſſer, or the leſſer by the greater.

Now according to vulgar Arithmatick, either I muſt reduce 158 ells 189∶756 parts of an ell into 756 parts, or otherwiſe I muſt

Reduce the fraction into his leaſt termes, makes 1∶4; then I multiply or reduce 158 ells into fourths, makes 633 fourths for the firſt number in the Golden Rule. Secondly, reduce 79 pound, 2 ſhilling, 6 pence into pence, makes 18990 pence for the ſecond number; then put 640 ells into fourths, makes 2560 fourths; then multiply

Diuide 7400, which is the product of 74 by 100, by 12 ſhillings, or 6 primes, and the quotient will be 12333 pound, 1∶3, and ſo much Ginger ſhall I haue for 100 pound at that rate. Or otherwiſe, diuide 100 pound by 6 primes, makes 166 2∶3, which multiply by 74, makes 12333 pound, 1∶3, as before.

                        When as any queſtion is propounded in the Golden Rule, marke what proportion is betweene the firſt and ſecond numbers, or betweene the firſt and third numbers, or betweene the third and ſecond; for if you

eſpie them in any proportion, the queſtion demanded is very ſpeedily anſwered, vpon the firſt ſight; or yet if you ſee them not exactly to be euen proportionals, yet you may ſubtract the firſt from the third, once twice or three times, or more and ſo often take the middle number towards the anſwer to the queſtion, and then you neede not to multiply by your whole third number, as you ſhall ſee by examples following.
                        
                           1. Example.
                        
                        If 34 ells coſt 2 pound, 4 ſhillings, 1 penny, what will 340 elles coſt? Heere comparing the firſt & third numbers, one with another, I find the third doth containe the firſt 10 times, wherefore I multiply 2 pound 4 ſhillings, 1 penny by 10, and the totall is 22 pound, 10 pence, the Anſwere.
                        
                           2. Example.
                        
                        If 82 ells of Cloth coſt 4 pound, 2 ſhillings, what will 324 ells coſt at that rate? Here I find 4 pound, 2 ſhilling in Decimals to be one halfe of 82, but it ſtandeth one roome leſſe in value then 82 doth, ſo I conclude,

that halfe of 324 one roome leſſe is 16 pound, 2 primes, or 4 ſhillings, the Anſwere.

                        If 345 ells of Holland coſt 34 pound, 10 ſhillings, what will 789 ells coſt at that rate? Set downe 34 pound, 10 ſhillings in Decimalls, makes 34 pound, 5 primes, which is the firſt number placed but one roome lower; therefore I ſay, if 345 ells coſt 34 pound, 5 primes one roome more to the right hand, then the third number alſo will coſt 78 pound, 9 primes one roome more to the right hand, which is 78 pound, 18 ſhillings.
                        
                           4. Example.

2 pence, 2∶5 of one penny.

                        If 130 coſt 26 pound, what coſt 3759.

them to ſtand thus, 75|5 primes for the firſt number, and 7|55 ſeconds for the ſecond number, which is the ſame one roome nearer the right hand: ſo I conclude, that the third number wil coſt 32|85 ſeconds, which is 32 pound 17 ſhillings.

Firſt, diuide 740 by 356, the quotient will be 2 and therefore I take twice the price giuen for that quotient, and then whereas before I ſhould haue multiplied 38 pound, 12 ſhillings, 1 penny by 740, I ſhall neede to multiply it but by 28 the remaynor, and diuide it by 356, makes 3|0368 fourths, to bee a

                        A Merchant hath owing vnto him, 540 pound, to be paid at the end of three yeares, now his debtor will pay him ready money, if he will abate him 9 pound in the hundred. Diuide 540 pound with Cyphers by 109 three times one after the other, and the third quotient will be the ſumme that hee ſhall pay in ready money▪ abating 9 pound in the hundred intereſt vpon intereſt. Behold the worke following.

                           1. Example.
                        
                        If 164 be 100, what are 356 ells? Multiply 356 by 100 and diuide by 164, makes 217 ells, 12∶164 of an ell, which 356 at Brudges will make in London. But according to the order of decimalls, if you will bring the meaſures of other places to thoſe of London? Set your number of one hundred found in the Table, to a vnite in decimalls, as in the laſt example 164 ſtands thus 1|64 ſeconds, then you neede but diuide

your number 356 by 1 pound, 64 ſeconds, and the quotient is 217 ells, 12 164 ells, as in the laſt example.
                        Againe, if you would reduce London meaſure to the meaſures of any other place? Find the number of 100 to that place, and ſet it decimalls, and multiply your number of ells at London by thoſe numbers found, and the product will be your deſire.
