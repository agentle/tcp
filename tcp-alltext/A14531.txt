honourable lorde Crumwell,

of vertue.
            VUho sowel feleth
the duties,
that belong to
an honest hert,
& is any thynge
aqueinted with
those three ladies,
which wonderfully maintein
the ioyful societie of mans
lyfe, called amonges the Grecians

Charites, among the latines
Gratie, he can not moste
gentill maister Crumwell, but
se infinite causes, why I ought
with all force of bodie, all
strength of mynde, all alacritee
and cheerefull promptnesse of
courage, studie to gratifie you,
studie to make you beare with
one, that fayne woulde, and neuer
can bee able to come out of
debte. The firste of these three
dames, is Bountifull beneficence,
a ladie of louely countenance,
and noble stomake, one
that alwaies longeth, still hauynge
that she longeth for, alwaies
with childe, and still deliuered,
alwaie profityng, and
still lustyng to profite, alwaie
helpyng some, and still desirefull

to helpe mo. The Grekes
name hir sometyme Euridomene,
whiche signifieth a large
and a plentifull giuer, somtime
Aglaia, which soundeth amonges
vs gladnes, teachynge men
euen by hir name, that of dutie
benefittes oughte to bee geuen
cherefullie. The second ladie is
Thankefulnesse of minde, neuer
forgettyng benefittes receiued,
hir name is Thalia, whiche
signifieth fresshenesse or
grenenesse, because duetie and
honestie woll, all pleasures, all
benefites stil to be freshe in memorie,
still to bee greene, neuer
to wyther, neuer to fade, all
tyme to florishe. The thirde
ladie is Euprosine, muche lyke
hyr sy
                  ••
               er Aglaia, a damoysell

full of solace, full of delectacion,
continually deuysyng, by
what meanes she may do pleasure
for pleasure, recompence
kyndnesse with kyndnesse. Authors
of great name and much
wisedome, make these three, to
go all hande in hande, the first
lokyng still forward, not once
castyng hir eie backe, neuer imbraydyng
benefites geuen and
past. The second and the third
euermore beholdyng the firste,
with amiable countenāce, with
faithfull eie of remembraunce,
and full intente of recompence,
as farre, as power furthered
with moste desire maie or can.
Under suche cloudes, sage and
graue writers ar wont darkely
to insinuate thynges of great

weight, thinges verie necessary
for the quiete and honeste leadyng
of mans life, things worthy
to be of all men imbraced
                  •
               
worthy to be set fixed and engrafted
in all mennes hertes.
            They perceyued, that morall
preceptes pleasantlie set out in
feat colours of wittie phantasies,
both crepe faster into our
bosomes, and also tary there
with muche more delectacion
and profite, than they would,
beyng playnly spoken. Wherfore
as you nowe se, what they
mente by those thre ladyes, so
you muste also nedes see, howe
I am bounde, to owe you my
herte, my seruice, with all that
they both maie dooe for you.
            For howe can I, my lord your

father, beyng so far in amours
with that louely ladie Euridomene,
leaue mine attendaunce
vpon thother two damoisels,
before life leaue me? How can
I, beeyng enuyronned with so
manie and ample his benefites
not desire Thalia and Euphrosine
that thei both report me, to
lacke power, but no good wil,
I truste they bothe shall haue
good cause so to do. Certes, if
I had sene, where either my littel
witte, or poore herte mighte
better haue serued his lordship
than in openyng vnto you his
dere and entierly beloued sōne
suche preceptes of vertue, as
maie make you moste like your
noble father, there are no pei

               e
                  •
               
that coulde haue kepte me

from doyng of it. Assure your
selfe, maister Crumwell, if laboure
and herte maie paie the
tribute, that loue oweth, you
shall neuer nede to arrest me.
            This boke, was gathered by
Ludouicus Uines, a man great
lie conuersaunt in all good authors,
and excellentlie wel sene
in all kindes of learnyng. The
boke hath vndoubtedly, muche
more liyng in his bosome, than
the title promiseth in the forehed.
It is not onely an Introduction
to wisedome, but if ye
goe as it leadeth you, it introduceth
wisedom into you, rootyng
the loue and desire of vertue
in your hert, extirpyng frō
it all maner of vice, and all vnclennesse,
furnishyng you with

generall preceptes, for all kyndes
of life, for all ages, for all
degrees and condicions, whiche
preceptes, if you harbou
                  •
               
in your breaste, must nedes be a
great slaie, helpe, and comfort
vnto your tender age. They
shal bryng to passe many thynges
in your life time, with gret
pleasure, and no peyne at all,
which otherwise experience oft
tymes poudred with bitter repentance,
shuld scace at length
teache you. It is as wise Socrates
saieth, Preceptes of lerning
were inuented at the first
as a nedefull staie and succour
vnto mans mynde, wantynge
knowlage & experience: euen as
a staffe is geuen of necessitie, to
staie vp a feeble body, assuredly,

I knowe no one booke vntranslated,
that hath halfe so
many holsome documentes, as
this hath, none that mai so wel
leade you the right way to true
honour, none where ye maie
either with more delite, or more
hope of your game, trace true
nobilitie. Folowe your leader,
goe on with your guide, you
shall finde all the steppes and
grices, whereby not onely my
Lord your father, honourablie
hath climed to nobilitie, but all
other, that in dede are or were
at any time noble
                  •
                you shal find
manie thynges here, that maie
bee to men in wealth and worship
an ornamente, many that
ar to mē assauted with the sur
               
                  ••
               s
of sower fortune, sure coū
               sailours,

bringyng with theim,
besides righte and honeste consolacion,
muche delectable doctrine
                  •
               
finally, manie that are
a souereigne medicine almoste
for all diseases. The booke is
nowe yours, I truste as the iewelles,
whiche it offereth vnto
you, bee great, rare, and preciouse,
that so ye wyll see theim
laied vp in place mete for suche
richesse. Locke theim fast in the
cheste of your herte, geue the
keie to remembraunce, that she
maie lette theim out, and carie
them home againe, at suche times
as ye shall thinke conuenient.
If ye make these preceptes
yours, by vse of them, speakyng
as they teache you, workynge
as they aduise you, who

shall haue more cause to reioice
of it, thā you your self? Wherin
can you more please my lorde
your fathers minde? What
thynge can more satisfie his desire?
What greatter comforte
can come to his Lordship, than
to see you most like him in condicions?
What greatter worship
to you, than to treade in
his steppes? What higher plesure
to al them that loue both?
your countrey knoweth what
noble feates my lorde your father
hath wrought by wisdom,
ladie gouernour of all vertues
                  •
               
who knoweth not, howe honestie
maie reioice, howe trueth
and religiō may holde vp their
handes to heuen, that god hath
sent to so gracious, so prudent

and wise a prince, so good so
wise and so faithefull a counsailour?
to so noble a maister,
so diligente a mynister, to so
high couragious and vertuous
a kyng, a subiecte of so noble
an herte and stomacke? I must
leaue of, I am entered into to
longe a matter for a shorte epistle.
Wherfore I can no more,
but with all herte, desire god,
that it maie please hym long to
preserue noble Henry the .viii.
styll in all welthe, in all honour
to reigne ouer vs, to the setting
foorthe of goddes honour, to
the spreadynge abrode of his
glorie, to the magnifiyng of
his name in all places, longe to
preserue my lorde to the furtherance
of the same. Finally, that

ye maie bee heire of his Lordeshippes
qualities and vertues,
as well as of his honour
and wordelie dignitie.
And thus our
Lorde send you
euer wel to
fare.

                  An introduction
to wisedome.
                  
                     
                        TRVE AND
veraie wisedome
is, corrupt
affection
set aside, truelie
to iudge of
thinges, & that
we esteeme euery
thing to be as it is, neither
couetyng the vile, as thoughe
they were preciouse, neither refusyng
precious, as thoughe
they were of no price: nor giuyng
dispraise to thinges worthie
praise, ne yet commendyng
thinges worthie discommendacion.
For, from this

spryng, all errour renneth into
mens mindes.
                  There is nothyng more hurtfull
in mans lyfe, than this corrupete
iudgement, this I saie,
where euery thynge is not estemed
as it ought to bee, and at
suche price, as it is woorthe.
                  The opinions and common
persuasions of the people are
pernicious: bicause for the most
parte they iudge of all thinges
most fondely.
                  Certes the vulgar people is a
great schoole maister of great
errours.
                  There is nothynge that we
ought to seke for with more studie,
than to bryng hym that geueth
him selfe to knowlage and
wisedome, from the iudgement

of the rude multiude.
                  First let him suspect as many
thynges, as the multitude, with
great assent, and consent, doth
approue, vntill he hath examined
them after those mens rule,
whiche make vertue a measure
to trie all mattiers by.
                  Let euery man, euen from his
childhode, vse to haue right opinions
of all thinges, which shal
growe and encrease, lyke as his
age dothe.
                  Let euery man desire vpright
thynges, & flee the croked: chose
the good, and refuse the euill,
this vse and custome shal turne
well doing almost into nature,
and so work, that none but suche
as ar cōpelled, and suche as

                        •
                     t in strife, founde the weaker,

shall be brought to do euill.
                  The best kynde of life is (as
sone as thou canst) to be chose
                        •
                     
Custome shall make this, as it
is best for the, so within a short
space, to be most pleasant.
                  All the reste of our lyfe hangeth
vppon our bringyng vp
                        •
                     
whan we be children.
                  Wherfore the first grice, that
men clyme vnto wysdom by, is
that that so many ancient writers
speake of, Seipsum nosce
                        •
                     
Euery man to know him selfe
                        •
                     
                  
                  
                     A diuision of suche thynges, as
ar perteignyng vnto men.
                     MAn is constituted and
made of body & mynde:
the body we haue of the

earth, and those elementes that
we se and touche, lyke vnto the
bodies of beastes.
                     The mynd we haue geuen vs
from heauen, lyke vnto angels,
lyke to god hym selfe: by this
parte man is estemed man, and
as great wise men thynke, they
alone are to bee taken for men,
that in this haue theyr iuste
porcion.
                     There be in the bodie, as belongyng
vnto it, beautie, helth,
integritee of membres, strength
lightnes, delectacion, and their
contraries as deformitee, sickenes,
lacke of limmes, wekenes,
sloth, sorowe, and other, as
well commoditees of the body,
as incōmoditees of the mynde,
as learnyng and vertue, & their

contraries, rudenesse and vice.
                     There be certaine thinges not
geuen to all men, but chansyng
to a fewe, and these be called
thynges, Extra hominem, besides
the nature of mā, as riches
power nobilitee honour dignitee
glory fauour, and their contraries,
pouertee, nedinesse, ignobilitie,
vile estimaciō
                        
                           •
                         shame,
obscurenesse, hatred.
                  
                  
                     A diuision of thynges and
their price.
                     THe queene and princesse
of all thynges most highest,
is vertue, vnto whom
all other serue, as handemaydes
theyr maistresses, yf they do
as by duetie they are bounden,

I call vertue a reuerēt loue towardes
god and man, a right
seruice and woorshippynge of
god, a right loue toward man,
loue I saie, not endyng in wordes,
but ioined with an ernest
will to doo good. Other thynges,
if they bee referred to this
Uertu, that is if thei be sought,
kepte, and spent for hir sake:
and at hir commandemēt, they
can not seme euill. Neither thei
that call ryches, and other thinges
lyke, godis, thought so of
theim, as nowe the rude people
do, the which hath so corrupted
the true and natiue significacions
of thynges, that many of
theim haue lost their right estimacion,
and ar changed vp set
doune. For we must vnderstād

where, whan, and howe farre
these thynges be good.
                     We maie not esteeme richesse
aboue theyr valu, or iudge, that
preciouse stones, metals, roiall
places, or gorgiouse implementes
of house, are rychesse, or
they ryche, that haue these: but
rather richesse is, not to wante
suche thynges, as are necessarily
required to mans life.
                     True glory, is to be well spoken
of, for vertues sake.
                     Trewe honour is to bee had
in veneracion for some greatte
vertue.
                     The grace that men obteine
of princis or other people, shuld
bee fauour borne to theym for
their amiable vertues and qualitees,
loue worthy.
                     
                        Dignitee is either a rihgt opinion,
whiche one man hath of
an other for vertues sake, or els
a certaine beautie of some inwarde
vertue, outwardly expressed
before mens eies.
                     Power and reigne is, to haue
manie, whom thou maiest succour
and ayde in right and honestie.
                     He is to bee reckened noble,
that is knowen by some excellent
acte, to be noble, orels cometh
of an anc
                           •
                        ent stocke, and
sheweth him selfe to bee in vertue
and worthie qualitees lyke
vnto his parentes.
                     A right gentilman is he, whō
nature hath facioned and set,
as it were in a standyng for the
receipte of vertue.
                     
                        Health is a temperate habitude
of the body, whereby the
mynd both kepeth hir strength
                           •
                        
and exerciseth
                           •
                         hir power.
                     Beautie standeth in suche 
                           ••
                        
                        niamentes,
shape, and portrature
of the body, as do shewe a
beautifull mind to dwel therin.
                     Strength and valiauntnesse
is, to suffise and accomplisshe
the exercises of vertue
                           •
                         without
werinesse.
                     Pleasure is a pure, sounde,
hole, and continual delectacion,
whiche is taken onely of those
thynges that belonge vnto the
mynde.
                     If a man do discusse and reason
these thynges afore rehersed,
otherwyse, that is, after the
mynde and iudgemente of the

ignorant people, he shall fynde
them, to be thynges vnmete for
men, thynges vaine, and also
veraie hurtfull.
                     Fyrst, all outwarde thynges
be either referred vnto the body,
or to the mynde, as richesse
ar to the maintenance of our
lyfe, honour to beare witnesse
of our vertue, and well doyng.
                     The body it selfe is no thyng
els but a couerture, and a thing
bound to serue the soule, where
vnto bothe nature reason and
comlines comnaunde the saied
body to bee subiecte as a thyng
brute, to that that dieth neuer,
a thyng earthely, to that that
hath a porcion of diuine Nature
in it.
                     Furthermore, learnynge is

sought for, and lodged in the
mynde for this intente, that we
maie therby bothe know sinne,
and eschue the same, and know
vertue, and atteine to it.
                     If learnyng dooe not this in
hym that hath it, she leaueth hir
holle duetie vndoone.
                     What other thyng is our life
but a certaine peregrinacion,
beset on euery side, with so many
dangerous chances, that the
ende therof, is euery houre hangyng
ouer it, whiche oft tymes
falleth vpon moste light occasions?
Wherfore it is a great foly
to do any thyng that is foule
or filthy, for the loue of vncertain
life, as who shoulde saie,
thou were suer to liue long after
thy naughty doyng.
                     
                        As it is in a iourney, so is it
in mans life, the lighter and les
burdeine a man carieth, the easier
and plesanter his iorney is.
                     Moreouer, the nature of man
is suche, and so ordeined, that
it nedeth veray fewe thynges.
In so much, that if a man woll
more nerely behold this thyng,
doubteles he can not but vtterly
condemne theym, as madde
folke, whiche so gredily and so
carefully accumulate gooddes
vpon goodes, where as so litle
suffiseth: His saiyng was prety
and quicke, that thus expresed
richesse: Sunt breuis vite
longum viaticum, that is: Thei
are great and long purueiance
for a littell and shorte life.
                     Wherefore richesse, possessions,

and apparell ought to be
prepared only for our necessary
vse, which vse is not holpen by
vnmeasurable richesse, but rather
oppressed, as shippes ouer
laden with to great a fraighte.
                     Gold it self, if thou vse it not,
differeth very little from claie,
sauyng that the custody therof
dothe put the to more vnquietnesse,
causing the, by reason thy
mynde is onely sette theron, to
neglect suche thynges as ought
aboue al other, to be regarded.
                     Money bryngeth men into a
kynde of idolatrie, as ofte as
for it those other thynges are
set asyde, I meane godly reuerence
and cleannesse, which are
the great, chief, and first in nature.
I lette passe, how many

deceites, gynnes, and traines
are laide for riches, howe many
and sondry waies thei come
to nought, and into howe many
vices they, whan they tary,
dryue menne, drawe menne,
drowne men.
                     What other thyng is gaie apparel,
but instrumētes to strike
vp a daunce for pride.
                     Necessitee firste inuented the
profitable garment, Riot and
Richesse founde the preciouse,
whiche Uanitee facioned vnto
hir tricke. Great contencion is
in varietee of apparell, whiche
hath taught men many superfluous
and hurtefull thynges,
by reason that they seeke to bee
honoured euen for that, whiche
plainely declareth their infirmitee,

foly, and weakenesse.
                     Hereby it commeth to passe,
that this part of riches, gorgious
buildynges, goodly householde
stuffe, preciouse stones,
and other riche ornamentes, be
set out rather for a bragge, and
to serue other mens eies, than
for the vse and profite of those
that possesse them.
                     What other thyng is nobilitee
nowe but a chaunce, to bee
borne of this or that gentille
bloude, and an opinion grafte
vpon the foolishenesse of rude
and vnlerned people, which oftentymes
is gotten by robbery

                     Honour, if it spryng not of
Uertue, is falsely geuen and
wrongefully taken, neither it

vertue teacheth the to refuse

whiche is doone for desire of
honour. Honour must folowe

                     What wyll ye nowe saye,
whan those thynges, whiche so
many men doe highly desire, bee
occasions of great vices, as of
insolent errogancie, of luskishnesse,
of fiercenesse, of enuie, of
priuie hatrede, of strife, of debate,
of battayle, murder, and
manslauter?
                     The delectacion of the body
is vile and beastly, as the body
it selfe is, and beastes bee more
oftener moued, and haue more
pleasure, and longer also than

men, the whiche pleasure not
onely ouer whelmeth the bodie
with many diseases, bringyng
greatte damage and losse
of gooddes, but also woundeth
the minde with sorowfull repē
                        taunce,
and dulleth the witte,
whiche is muche extenuated, abated,
and broken through the
delicate cherishyng of the body.
Fynally there foloweth irkesomnes
of it selfe, and hatred
of all vertue.
                     It is not la

to vse suche pleasures openlie.
For as they muche misbecome
the noblenesse of mans mynde:
so is there none so far paste all
grace, but he bassheth to vse
theim in presence of many witnesses.
No because they ingeuder

ignominy and shame, suche
as vse theym, are driuen to seke
darkenesse and secrete corners.
                     And furthermore these fleing
shorte and soone passyng pleasures,
maie neither, by any meanes
be reteined and kepte, neyther
yet come they pure, but are
with some bitternesse intermingled.
Therfore iudge not, after
the consent of the common people,
the greattest euell to bee,
pouertee, ignobilitee, imprisonment,
nakednes, worldly shame
deformitee of body, sickenesse,
& imbecilitee, but rather thynke
vices, and their affinitees, as
folisshenesse, ignorancie, amased
dulnesse, and lack of brayn,
the greattest euils: and theyr
contraries, knowlage, quickenesse

of witte, and sobrietee of
mynde, to be great vertues.
                     If thou haue either giftes of
fortune or of bodie, they shall
muche profite the, if thou bestowe
theym vertuosely, but if
they helpe to sette out vice, they
muste nedes do the muche hurt.
If thou haue neyther the one
nor the other, seeke theym not
with the losse of honestie, for
that were euen to bye a littell
claye, with a greatte summe of
golde: or to chaunge helthe, for
peynfull sickenes.
                     There can be no greatter vantage
to the soule, than is the
increase of godlinesse, no greater
gaynes to the body, than to

beare a sowle inclosed
within our body, gret treasure
in brickle vessels, we maie not

not take it selfe, to be a maister
or a felowe, but rather a seruaunt,
and that, Bodie is not
fed for his owne sake, but for
Soules sake.

soule loked vpon, the more delicately
the body is handled: the
more stubbornely it wrasteleth

against the mynde, and doothe
caste it of, as an horse to well
cherished, vseth to caste his rider.
The heauy burdein of the
body, sore oppresseth the minde,
fatnesse, and ouermuche cheryshyng

and dulleth the quickenesse of

                     Meate, slepe, all maner of exercise,
and all the whole gouernance
of the body must be vsed
for the health therof, and muste
not bee set vpon pleasure and
delicacie. Thus it may the better
serue the mynde, and not
waxe wanton, through to much
pamparyng: nor yet fall in decaie,

whiche bringeth remedie and

to cherisshe the bodie, muche
more ought to bee geuen to
the soule, for as muche as the
diseases therof, be more priuy,
more greuouse, and also more
perillous.
                     These diseases be named, and
not without a cause, Sharpe
stormes, greuouse tourmentes,
scourges, brondes, and the furies
of mannes mynde, whiche
bryng with them muche calamitie,
and intollerable corsies, if
they bee suffered to reigne: and
contraryly, moste pleasaunt

accomplisshmente of this,
suche documentes serue muche,
as haue been of most excellente
wittes, for the furtheraunce of
good life, and maintenaunce of
maners prescribed.
                     This is the great rewarde,
and the very fruite, that lerned
menne take of theyr longe and
peinfull study, not to gather many
thynges for men to wonder
at, or elles suche as he him selfe

helpe al men, and most chiefely
hym selfe, and not to lette theim
lye, as in a boxe of oyntementes,
where out is taken salues,
to help other men, the box therwithall,

neuer a dele the better.
                     Christen Religion loketh for
nothynge so muche, as that a
cleane and a pure conscience
maie exhilerate the mynde, and
that affections, beynge ones
staied and settled, we maie bee

be gotten, eyther of outwarde
thynges, either of our selues, or
of god, orels of the lawe and
lyfe of Christe.
                     The nature of thynges is suche,
that as they bee all vncertayne,
shorte, chaungeable, and
vile, the soule onely excepted,
whiche is in dede very man, or
at the least, the moste preciouse

parte of man: so all other thynges
bee translated from one to
an other, leaste men shoulde call
any thyng theirs, besyde theyr soule.
                     Let no man thinke those thinges,
which, he hath in his possession,
to be geuen hym, but rather
to be lent him for a season.
                     Wherfore it is great madnes
to renne into any synne, worthy
greuous punishmente, for

ageine, at the vttermost, whan
death commeth: and oft times
euen while we be aliue.
                     Neither we ought to mourne
if that thyng, whiche was lent

geuen vs to keepe, bee asked againe,
but it rather becommeth

                     And for asmuch, as this life is
none other thyng but a certaine
pilgremage, whereby we still be
entryng into an other life eternall,
and seeyng also, we neede
verie fewe thynges, for the performance
of the saide iourneie,
what hath this worlde worthy
longe suite? What folie, to
seke suche thynges by peynefull
seruitude, as we see tossed and
tourned in a momente hyther
and thither.
                     For what ende or pourpose
shuld we serue our neuer satisfied
desyre and appetite, whan

thynges to come be vncertaine,
and we at this present nede very

                     Now I praie you, what other
thyng is it to bee replenyshed
with the giftes of fortune
than a foote man to bee cumbe
red with diuers and many fardelles?
                     There is no man so dulle, no
suche lacke witte, but he rather
prepareth and fitteth hym selfe
for the citee, where he purposeth
to dwel, than still seketh things
for his iourney:
                     Sithens this our lyfe is of

nature droupyng and fleeyng,
the moste parte therof, and almoste
all, is spent in perturbacion,
in troubles, in fantasies:
we can not saie, we liue all the
while, that we bee tossed with
affections, and in especiall,
whan the feare of deathe troubleth
vs. And where as deathe
maie come to vs, by an infinite
sort of waies, it is great foly,
to feare, that it shuld come this
waie or that waie: and seynge
that it shall of necessitee come,
we may not cōmit any gret mischiefe
or wickednes, to auoyde
it, nor we oughte to mourne,
though it chaunce.
                     Our life beyng oppressed with
so many diuers miseries. what
nede we to kepe it with such anxietie?

to set so much by it, seing
also we go to an other, whiche
is a life euerlastyng. Let vs so
order our selues, that we haue
redy passage to that lyfe, which
is replenished with al goodnes,
ful of ioy eternall, full of mirth
euerlastyng.
                     Our errours oppresse vs, rather
than thynges theim selfe:
where as we ofte tymes thynke
theym to bee great euylles, that
are none in deede, and greatte
gooddes, that of trouthe are
worthe nought.
                     The nature, condicion, and
true value of thynges be those,
whiche I haue rehersed in the
begynnynge: whereby it may
be playnly gathered, that there
is nothynge fayre, nothynge

of price, fynally nothynge to be
accounted ours, but onely vertue.
                     Where as deliberacion is taken,
we beyng in doubt, to whiche
parte we maie moste incline
the loue of our body, and
the desire of thinges here in this
lyfe, that is to saie, the loue of
our selfe, is chiefe counsellour,
and one that we all togither folowe.
                     This weakeneth the strength
and manhod of our myndes so
muche, that nothyng can be so
lyttell, but it is easely able to
penetrate theym, nothynge so
sklender or smalle, but it maie
be able to disturbe theym.
                     This blindeth the eies of the
mynde: and whan affections,

haue ones gotten the vpper hād,
we flatter, we yelde, we obeie
them, as our lordes and rulers.
                     Thus we holde thynges with
tooth and naile, that are alien
from vs, as they were ours:
and if they be withdrawē from
vs, we lamente, tourmentyng
our selfes, as though wee had
great losse.
                     We neglecte our owne, as
none of ours, and doe shonne
thynges profitable, as veraie
hurtfull to vs, enbracyng thinges
hurtful, as very profitable.
                     The harmes of other folkes
seme small, but we thynke our
owne, beyng nothyng so great
as theyrs, intollerable: neither
content with that we wishe our
selues, nor yet pleased, if we

myght obteine that that other
men muche desire. We lyke not

thei be, and in like trade be these
mindes racked and tourmented

                     Angre, whiche is the sorest of

It eateth vp the hert, and drinketh
vp the holsom bloud of the
body, constrainyng man to doe
that thyng, wherof Repentance
shortly ensueth.
                     How shamefull a chaunge is
there in the face, what sodeine

tempestes arise there, what burnyng
eies, what snuffyng of the
nose, what grennynge of the
teethe, what fomynge of the
mouthe, what palenesse, what
stuttyng of tong, finally, what
terrible and vncomely criynges
bee there in hym, that is inflamed
with this fury? Truly suche,
that some, whiche haue in
theyr angre beholden theim selfe
in a glasse, haue not knowen
theim selfe.
                     The angrie man for his grim
countenaunce, his sharpe wordes,
and cruell deedes, ofttimes
loseth muche of his auctoritee,
muche beneuolencie is taken
from hym, his friendes forsake
hym, no man wyll mete hym, he
is lefte all alone, all men hate

and abhorre hym. Wherefore
great wise men neuer eschewed
thynge more, or cloked thynge
with greatter diligence, than
they dyd Ire, and the woorkes,
of Ire, An so muche, that they
not only wrastled against theyr
owne nature, but in spite of hir
bearde gaue hir the fall.
                     What is more worthy to be
scorned, than so littell and so
weake an animall, to rage and
stere vp so greatte and so fierce
tragedies, for vile trifles, and
thynges of no value? as some
tyme for the giftes of the body,
or of fortune, yea and somtime,
wysely a goddes name, for one
littell worde.
                     Thou shalte sone subdue angre,
if thou hold and fasten this

thynge in thy mynde, that is to
saie: No iniurie to be done, excepte
whan the mynde taketh

but onely he that possesseth
it, and that by defilyng it
with sinne.

                     This worlde, is in maner as
it were an house, or a temple of
God, whiche of noughte is
brought forth into this shappe
and ornacie, that it nowe is in.
Therefore it hath receiued this

much to saie, as a comely Ornament,

                     And like as in the house of a

most prudent gouernour, nothyng
is done without his commaundement,
so in this world
is there nothing done, without
his will or bydding: the which
as he can all thynges do, so he
knoweth how to do al thinges.

                           •
                        
                        
for no mā knoweth it in very
dede, except he liue therafter.
                     Christes life witnesseth his
perfecte humanitee, his myracles
declare the infinite power
of his deitie, his lawe sheweth
his heauenly wisedome: so that
of his perfect goodnesse of lyuing,
we haue exāple to folowe
him, of his power and auctoritee,
strength to obey hym: of his
wisedome, faith to beleue hym.
                     Let his goodnes prouoke the
to loue him, his maiestie to worshyp
hym, his wisedome to beleue
him.
                     If a man dooe well consider
those thinges, which Christ cō
                        mandeth,
he shall find all done
for our profite, in so muche,
that who so feeleth him selfe to

beleue rightli, that perceiue it is
to his own great profite, goodnesse,
and comforte.
                     As there is nothyng more plesant
to mā, than to be beleued,
so it is euen to god, for no man
cā thinke wel of him, to whom
he committeth hym selfe, afraid
of hurte.
                     The foundacion of our saluacion
is to beleue god, to be
                           •
                        
father, and Iesus Christe his
onely sonne, to be our law maker,
and the holy goste to bee
breathed out of bothe, without
whom, we do nothīg, we thinke
nothing, that can profite vs.
                     The true woorshyppyng of
god, is to clense and purify the
soule from all diseases and vnclene
lustes, & to be tourned as

neere to his similitude as wee
maie, so that we bee, as he him
selfe is, clene and holy: & that
we hate no man, but rather studie,
by all meanes to profitte
all men.
                     The more thou transposest
thy self from thynges corporal,
vnto thynges incorporate, the
more godly life shalt thou leade.
                     Thus shall it bee broughte to
passe, that God maie acknowlage
our nature, as of kynne,
and lyke vnto hym, and maie
delite in it, makyng it his true
and right temple, muche more
acceptable to hym, than churches
made of lyme and stone.
                     The temple of god is holye,

                     It is wickednesse, to

and veneracion.
                     Whan thou hearest any title
or propre name gyuen vnto
Christe, lifte vp thy selfe vnto
the contemplacion therof, and
praie vnto hym, that he wyll
shewe hym selfe, euen suche a
one towardes the. As whā thou
herest him called merciful, meke
or gentill, praie that thou maist
proue hym the same vnto the:
whē he is called almighti, desire
that he maie shewe it, in the makynge
the, of the most wretched
sinner, a good lyuer, of an ennemie,
his soonne, of nothyng,
some thyng: whan thou hearest
him called terrible, intreate him
to feare theym, of whom thou

art feared: Whan thou callest
hym lorde, loke thou thou serue
hym: Whā than callest him father,
see thou ioue hym, and see
thou shew thy self a child, worthy
to haue so noble a Father.
                     There is nothynge in all the

For God, in whose power art
all thynges, geueth prosperous
furtherance and finyshyng vnto
suche actes, as we doe begyn
in his name.
                     What so euer thou shalt go a

boute, euer haue an eye to the
ende thereof, and whan thou
haste taken good counsell, be
not carefull, but put thy truste
in hym, in whose hande resteth
the lucke of all thynges.
                     And holinesse remaineth in the
secrete partes of the hertes, labour

maiest lose no tyme in lippe labour.
And whan thou praieste:

tongue, and all thy gesture agree

as be worthie to bee asked, and

of his giftes, consider what
cursed vnkyndnesse, and what
damnable rashnesse it is, to be
so bolde, to fall at debate with
hym, by whose benefite and
wyll, thou haste thy beynge,
and lenger shouldest thou not
be, if he wolde not.
                     At thy table, let all thyng be

chast, pure, wise, holy, euē as he
is, whose giftes thou art nowe
in hande with. Let all backbytyng,
bitter wordes, fierce and
cruell speakyng, bee seeluded
from thy table, where thou felest
the incredible swetenes and
clemency of god towardes the.
                     Wherfore it is more intollerable,
that thou shouldest contaminate
that place with sharpnesse,
and hatrede againste thy
brother, where thou findest muche
fauour and gentill softnesse
towardes the.
                     This thyng the Gentiles wel
perceiued, whiche for the same
skill named al thinges, dedicate
and belōging to the table, with
names of pleasauntnesse and

                     Seynge therfore, thou haste

is most in might, wisedom, and
liberalitee, put awaie the inordinate
regarde of thy selfe,
wherin thou semest, to mistrust
his goodnes, and labour only,

namely for asmuche as

the life is not preserued by meat
but by the wyll and pleasure of
god: according to the saiyng of
scripture, Not in bread onely
lyueth man, but in euery word
of god.
                     We haue by indenture of Iesu
lorde of all, in heauen and
earth, that they shall lacke nothyng,
which seke accordyngly
the kyngdom of god, and rightuousnesse
allowed before hym.
                     Seyng therfore, that god is
so bountifull towardes the, in
his giftes, be not thou vnkynd
to thy brother, accomtyng hym
no lesse to be the sonne of god,
than thou thy selfe: and that
god is no more bounde to the,
than to hym: and that he hathe
only made the a mynister of his

giftes, of whom next vnto god,
thy brother shoulde aske reliefe.
                     Neyther is there any thynge
more truely geuen to Christe,
than that that is bestowed vppon
the poore.
                     Whan thou haste with meates
and drynkes refresshed thy
self, consider whose prouidence
and power it is, to susteyne the
lyfe with such thynges as thou
hast receiued, and giue thankes
therefore to god, not as thou
wouldest to hym, whiche hathe
prepared sustenaunce for the,

as are mete for hym, whiche
hath made bothe the, and
also the meate susteinynge the
lyfe, not by the strenthe of the
saide meate, but by his diuine

power, & inestimable goodnes.
                     At thy downe liyng and vprisyng,
remembre the benefites of
god, not only towardes the, but
towardes all mankynde: yea
and al the whole worlde.
                     Consider, in what dangers
man is, while he lieth lyke a
deade carcas, hauyng no power
of hym selfe. Wherefore
Christe must so muche the more
instantly be sought vpon, that
he maie voucsafe to defende vs
silly wretches.
                     Hede ought to be taken, that

euery day resembleth the whole
lyfe of man, whome the nighte
succedeth, and slepe a very expresse
token of death.
                     We must therfore praie vnto
Christe, that he vouchesafe, to
bee with vs euer fauourable,
both in tyme of lyfe and death,
and that he vouchsafe to grant
that to bee pleasant and quiete

                     Wee muste praie hym, that

but that euen sleapyng, we may

refreshed with his comforte, we

may rise merily in the mornyng
remembryng his blessed deathe,

goodnesse of God, haue transcended

excellencie, and nowe nigh conioyned
with god.
                     Where as there is so greatte
lyknesse of men, hothe in body &
mind, they being all brought into
this world by one right and

title, made and appointed to a
certaine communion and societee
of lyfe, to the preseruacion
wherof, nature hath proclaymed
this lawe, Let no man to
an other do, that that he wolde
not haue doone to hym

                        elfe.
                     He that restored nature decaied
hath professed this one doctrine
to be his, but yet expressyng the
same more at large, and settyng
it out more plainly, for to make
the nature of man perfecte in
euerie condicion, and as lyke
vnto god as it maie be, he commaunded
vs, not onely to loue
one an other, but also to loue
our enemies, that we maie bee
like the father of heauen, which
sincerely loued his enemies, as

                           •
                        e declareth by his great benefites

shewed vnto them.
                     And howe is it to be marked,
that the nature of man is such,
that we woulde them to be our
frendes, whome we our selues
can in no wise loue.
                  
                  
                     Of Charitee.
                     THis moste wyse maister
and guyde of our lyfe,
hathe geuen vs this one
document, to xnle our lyfe by,
that is, to loue one an nother:
knowyng, that by this onely
rule, we myghte leade a blessed
lyfe, without neede of any moe
lawes.
                     There is not a more blessed
thyng than to loue. And therefore
god and his aungelles, bee

moste blessed, as they that loue
all thynges.
                     Nothynge is more wretched,
than to hate, by the whyche affecte,
the diuelles bee moste miserable.
                     Trewe loue weieth all a like:
where true loue reygneth, no
man seketh preferment, no man
stealeth from his well beloued,
accomptyng all suche thynges,
to be with hym selfe, which are
with his frende.
                     Loue contendeth not with his
dere brother, nor thynketh not,
that he doothe hym any iniurie
at any tyme, and therfore he neither
remembreth displesure, ne
enuyeth hym, because he loueth
hym: no man reioyceth in the
mysfortunes of his frende, neither

is greeued at his prosperitee,
but contrarywise, he ioyeth
with them that reioyce, and wepeth
with theim that wepe, accordyng
to the saying of the Apostle.
And this dooeth he not
fayntly, but with all his herte,
for as muche as he esteemethe
those thynges, whyche appertayne
to hym, whom he loueth,
as his owne.
                     The moste sure, sounde, and
true example of this maner of
lyuyng are the actes of Christ,
set before aur eies.

hungred, he thyrsted, he was

                     Why suffered he these infirmities,

So greatly loued hepeace,

god so entierly loued, that he
shronke not, to giue his life therfore.
                     The lorde was crucified, for

                     Thinke not, that thou canste

none other thankes,
but that we do loue and shewe
our selues frendli to our felow

seruantes, as he being our lord
loued vs, whan we were leude
and naughty, and deserued muche
euill.
                     Here beganne he the mutuall
bonde of loue betwene manne
and man, and men towardes
god, that is to saie, here he laid
the fondacion of mans felicitee
and fenisheth the same in heuē.
                     This is the lyfe and grace of
Christ, wisedom exceding mannes
capacitee, agreyng in equitee
to theym, that haue vnderstanding,
and alluryng all men
to goodnesse.
                     Let no man thynke hym selfe
a right christian, or to be in the
fauoure of god, yf he hate any

commended al men to our loue

worthy to be obeied.
                     Neyther fastynges, nor yet
great richesse bestowed amonge
poore folkes make a man acceptable
to god. Only Charitee toward
mā bringeth this to passe,
as the Apostle hath taughte vs.
                     Thou oughtest to loue euery
man as thy naturall brother,
reioycynge of his prosperitee,
and sorowyng for his aduersitee,
being alwaie ready to helpe
him to thy power,
                     Lette neyther nacion, citee,
nor kinrede, let not profession,

state, ne condicion of lyuyng,
let not wyt dimynisshe this affecte
of loue: for there is one
father of all, God, whom thou
art taught of Christ, to call father
daily: which wol acknowlage
the to be his childe, if thou
in lyke maner knowlage al his
children to be thy brethern.
                     Be not ashamed, to take him
for thy brother, whom Christe
disdeigneth not to take for his
sonne.
                     God brought peace, concord,
and loue into the worlde, the diuell,
as moste experte artificer,
inuented partakynges, quarelling,
priuate profit, dissenciōs,
debate, and warre.
                     God, willyng our saluacion,
sprinkeleth amonge vs beneuolence:

the diuell, willynge one
distruction, soweth hatred and
enmitee.
                     Small substance encreaseth,
where concorde reygneth: by
discorde, great thynges ar scatered,
and come to naught.
                     They that studie, to make
peace and concorde betwene mā
and man, stablishyng the same
with all theyr myght, shall he
called the children of god: and
they that dooe the contrary, the
children of the diuel, as Christe
him selfe plainly testifieth.
                     The highest poynt, wherin a
man passeth the fiersenesse of
all wylde beastes, is battell, a
thyng more agreyng to beastes
vnreasonable, than to manne,
whiche is well declared by the

name, that the latin

                     Howe muche dooeth nature
hir selfe abhorre from warre,
which brought forthe man into
this worlde, naked without armure,
shapyng hym to mekenes
and louely societee of lyfe?
                     God also abhorreth the same,
which wol and cōmādeth mutuall
loue betwene man & man.
                     One of vs maye not warre
with an other, ne hurte one the
other, without greuous offence
                     If thou suspecte any man, to
beare grudge or displeasure in
his mind towardes the, labour
with hand and fote, reconcile
and pacify him, spare thou not
in this behalf to pray to flatter
and to bestowe thy goodes, so

that thou mayst therby obteyn

is the moste readye and compendious
waie, to come to goddis
fauour.
                     Thou shalte scorne no man,
remembryng, that what so eu

an other. No, rather giue thankes
to god, that he hath kepte

praie partly, that no lyke thing
may fortune to the, partely for
remedy vnto hym that is thus
afflicted, or at the lest that god
wyll geue hym grace, to take
it thankefully, and helpe hym
yf thy power wyl extend therto.
                     It is a token of a dogged her
                           •
                        
to reioyce in an other mannes

misfortune, and not to pitie the
common course of nature.
                     Bee mercyfull to man, and
God wol haue mercy vpō the.
                     The fortune and chance, that
foloweth mankind, is common
to euery man, thretnyng dayly
all men, and hanging ouer euery
mans head.
                     Thynke it not possible, that
thou canst doo any thing more
agreyng to this loue, dewe vnto
manne, than if thou brynge
theim to the greattest good of
this worlde, Uertue.
                     Agayn, tho
                           •
                         canst dooe nothyng
more repugnant to loue,
than to bryng any man by euill
counsaile, exaumple, or otherwise
vnto synne.
                     The chiefest and happiest of

all other thynges, is for a man
to loue, yea although he be not
loued ageine, yet that not withstanding
to be loued, is the swetest
and the surest thyng.
                     No treasure is of so great certaintee:
as perfecte loue and amitee:
no garde so stronge, as
faithfull frendes.
                     He taketh the son out of the
world that taketh loue frō lyfe.
                     Trewe loue, sure and stable
frendshyp resteth in theym only
that bee good and vertuous, amonge
whom, loue lyghtly increaseth.
                     Euyll men are so farre from
louyng the good, that they can
not one loue an other.
                     The rediest waie to be loued,
is first to loue. For loue is allured

by nothynge so muche as
by loue.
                     Loue is gotten also by Uertue,
whiche of hir selfe is so amyable,
that ofte tymes she inuiteth,
and in maner constrayneth
men to loue hir, which neuer
knew hir.
                     Loue is also allured by tokens
of vertue, as by demure
softnesse, by comely shamefastnesse,
by humanitee, by gentill
and faire speeche, specially yf
thou neyther saye ne dooe any
thynge, that sauoreth of arrogācy,
insolency, or malapert vnciennesse.
Let all thy actes be
swete, softe, gentill, and pure.
                     The venome of loue and amitee
is, to loue thy friende so,
that thou yeldest vppon occasion

to hate hym, or so to take
hym thy frende, that thou thynkest
he maie be thyne enemy.
                     This saiyng is godly, I hate
as one redy to loue.
                     Let no remembraunce of displeasure
be, where loue is, nother
thynk, that he, whom thou
takest for thy frende, can be thy
ennemie, for els shall thy loue be
veray weake and brickle.
                     In frendshyp muste be suche
faith, constancy, and simplicite
that in no wyse thou haue any
suspicion in thy frende, or geue

                        are vnto theym that suspecte
hym, or shall euill reporte hym.
                     Lyfe is no lyfe, to suche as
lyue in suspicion or feare, but
rather such lyfe is a continuall
death.
                     
                        Be not inquisitiue, howe other
men liue: for thei that passe
to much of other mennes affayres,
ofte tymes loke vpon theyr
owne businesse but sklenderly.

grudges, and suche as vse
these thynges, be most cōmonly

mote in an other mans eye, and
not see a greatte beame in their

to know other men so well, and
to know them selfe neuer a dele

duetie of our hole lyfe. To the
better accomplishment wherof,

Whan thou arte in presence of
men, so order all the partes of
thy body, & in speciall thy eies

                     Besydes all this, there is no
man, whom god is content to
take for his son, that can iustly
be contemned, excepte thou also
in hym contemne goddes iudgement.
                     Use no doggisshe eloquence,
seke not preyse of cunnyng by
contumelious speche agaynste
thy brother, as touchyng whose
reproche, better it were for the
to be tounge tied.
                     Ofte tymes men vnknowen &
dispised, are after founde worthy

                     Of speche and communicacion.
                     GOd gaue man a tounge,
to be an instrument, to
set forwarde, keepe and

preserue the societee of mannes
lyfe: for the maintenance wherof
nature bindeth man to man.
                     This toung is cause of many
cōmodities, if thou vse it well:
cause of many myschieues, yf
thou misuse it. Therfore Iames
the Apostle doth resemble it veraie
well to the sterne of a shyp.
                     Tounge muste be brideled and
kepte in, that she neyther hurte
her selfe, nor any other.
                     Sinne is wrought by no instrument
so easily, ne so oft, as
by the tounge.
                     Thou shalt not rayle, curse, ne
hurte any man: thou shalte saie
nothing, either to the losse of his
goodes or good name.
                     Thou shalte not dishonestly,
proudely, or malopertely rage

agaynste any man, thou shalte
immoderately inuey agaynst no
man, although thou be thereto
prouoked: for so doynge, thou
shalt more hurte thy selfe before
god, and men of wisdom, than
him, ageinst whom thou railest.
                     To giue one euill word for an
other, is as muche as to wype
awaie one durte with an other.
                     To threatten, is a poynte of
naughty packes, of dwellers on
the other syde of the water. Be
not of so weake a mynde, of so
tender an hert, that a few wordes
be able to wounde the.
                     Be not to curiouse, in reprehendyng
other men, but rather
labour, that they may not finde
in the any thyng reprouable.
                     And if thou chance, to rebuke

any persone worthyly, yet vse
no crueltee in thy wordes, but
myngle thy sharpe checkes with
som mild cōmunicacion, that if
thou make any wounde, it may
be swaged therby: but euer takyng
hede, that the fruite of reprehencion
be not loste, whiles
that thou studiest ouer much to
mitigate the matter.
                     Beware thou slyde not into
flattery.
                     Assentacion is a foule vice, 
                           •
                        
bringeth the saier to dishonesty,
and the hearer to great hurte.
                     Thynke nothyng so precious,
that thou oughteste for it, to
swerue from right and truthe.
                     Let neither ryches ne frendshyp,
neither intreatie, ne thretenynges,
let no feare of deathe

obteyne this of the.
                     Thus doyng, thou shalt be
regarded and trusted, al thy saiynges
shall be as gospelles: yf
thou do contrary wise, thou
shalte nothynge be estemed, ne
thought worthy to be hearde.
                     Let thy communicacion be sobre,
ciuile, gentyll, and nothyng
rough, rusticall, or rude, nor yet
ouer much curious, lest he shuld
haue nede of an interpretour,
that wolde vnderstande the.
                     Use no contumeliouse nor obstinate
langage, vse not to flater
with nice and minced wordes.
                     There is a certaine meane,
whiche neither leeseth his owne
dignitie, nor taketh awaie an
other mans.
                     Wanton vncleannes, is as

well to be refused in our talke,
as is poyson in our meate,
                     Be not hasty, whan thou spekest,
let not thy toung go before
thy wyt, make no aunswere before
thou perfectly vnderstandest,
what the matter meaneth.
                     This saiyng, What so euer
fyrst cometh to the tonges end

as nothing ought to be spoken
among frendes, wherby amitie
myght be appeyred?

& priuie hatredes, to the
entent he wolde, that men shuld
be circumspecte in theyr speche,
thretned al men, that they haue
to make a counte of euery ydell
word at the daie of iudgement.
                     Therfore the prophete sayth.
Set thou a watch vnto mi mouthe,
and a doore before my lips.
                     Be not to busie in talkyng or
to ful of woordes: haue not al
thy cōmunicacion alone. There
is a certain ordre and course in
talkyng, although thou cōmon
with moste vnlerned and vilest
persones. And yet drawe not
thy wordes soo, that thou
mayst seme to harkē to thy self,
and to dooe so, because euery
woorde that cometh from the,

semeth a rose.
                     It is more better for the, amonge
wyse men, to harken
than to speake: yet sometime it
is no lesse faute, for a man to
holde his peace, than it is at an
other tyme to speake, whan it
behoueth hym not.
                     There is no pleasure to bee
compared to the communicacion
of a man, that is wise and
well lerned.
                     Be neuer to inquisitiue, for it
is peinfull, and causeth hatrrd.

                     If any thyng be promised the,
exact it not, being alway streghter
in iudgment to thy selfe thā

                     For although Ueritee sometymes
at the firste displeaseth,
yet at the length it is very amiable
and louely accepted.
                     The truth mai wel be peined,
it wil not be oppressed. It maie
be blamed, it wil not be shamid.
                     As the profit gotten by liyng,
is nothing sounde nor durable,
euen so the damage that commeth
by truthe tellyng, hyndereth
not long.
                     Absteyne from liyng, as from
a cōmon rot. For there is no viler
thyng in man, whiche therby
separateth hym selfe from

god, and becometh the dyuels
bondeman. And come the lie out
early or late, Shamefull ignominie
is sure the liers part.
                     What is counted more vile?
what worse than a lier? If mē
knowe the for a lyer, no man
will beleue the, although thou
speakest neuer so truely.
                     Contrary wyse, if thou bee
true of worde, thy becke shalbe
better beleued than other mens

one with an nother, thou
greatly nedest neyther force of
memory, nor any other art, but
alwaies to saie that thou thinkest
truthe.
                     Truthe euer consenteth to

truthe, falsehode neither with
truthe, nor yet with falsehod.
                     But if thou wilt thyne opinion
to be true, beleue nothyng
lightly, but thynges approued,
or els thynges that haue greate

only of acquentance, and some

and to some thou shalt

agaynst thy selfe, ouermuch offende

                     It is a token of a gentill and
noble hert, to forgyue: of a cruell,
fierce, vnnaturall, and vile
stomacke, to retayne anger,
whiche thinge euen very nature
sheweth in dombe beastes.
                     And seyng god is redy to doo
nothinge more oft, or more gladly
than to forgeue, who is so
mad to deny, but that the same
thyng is both moste godly and
most excellent, by whiche we so
much resēble the nature of that
high and mighty god?
                     Deale thou with other men, as
thou woldest Christ shuld deale

with the.
                     And truely, it is meete, that
thou graunt lyke forgeuenesse
to thy neyghbour, as thou nedest
at goddes hande either for
the same, or other lyke offences.
                     There is no prayer more acceptable,
or of more efficacy afore
god, than that his soonne
Iesus Christe our lorde, hathe
taught vs, whiche is therfore
named, Our lordes prayer:
Nowe thou canst not saie that
praier with a pure mynde, except
thou vtterly, and with all
thy herte, forgeue thy brother,
what so euer thou woldest god
to forgeue the
                           •
                        . A great faute is

in comparison of that, wherin

whiche is to be estemed & waied
euen so muche the greuouser, as
god is great & higher than man.

                     God is lorde ouer al men, we be

foolishly.
                     We ofte take that for an iniury,

                        This is it, that god promyseth
in the gospel vnto his welbeloued
children, that they shall
receyue, euen in this lyfe, much
more pleasure, than they haue
forsaken for his sake.

fooles more to embrace foly.
                     The witnesse of Conscience
is true, sound, and permanent,
and shall be of great auctoritee,
whan God shall syt in that his
dredful iudgement, 
                           •
                         is a maistresse
of great gouernance, euen
in this life. This conscience is,
as the poet featly nameth it, a
brason wal to stand betwixt vs
and all dangers of this worlde,
neither is there any thynge so
terrible, that can shake hym
whom this wall defendeh, beyng
coupled and knit vnto god
with herte and mynde, puttyng
his trust in him only, knowyng
that he hath taken the peculiar
charge of hym, to whome all
thynges obey.
                     It is great shame for the, to

be better knowen of other men
than of thy selfe.
                     Is it not enough for the, to be
knowen of thy selfe and of god?
                     They that caste away the regarde
of god, and lie still without
feare in sinfulnes, artwise
to be condemned: because they
regarde neyther god nor man.
                     All suche are iniurious to theyr

theyy owne conscience, whiche
nowe renneth at large in synfulnes,
bycause it is not bridled
with feare.

all his endeuour and feruente

                           •
                        
of man, with her true and naturall
ornamentes, that is to
wite, with Religion & godlines.
                     He loueth not hym selfe
                           •
                         whiche
setteth his mynde, vpon rychesse,
honours, & worldly pleasures,
or any other bodily thīg:
for so muche as the moste precious
part of man, is the mynde.
                     Neither loueth he hym selfe
                           •
                        
whiche for lacke of knowlage
of his owne misery, deceiueth
hym selfe, or suffereth other to
deceiue hym: beyng glad as hauynge
those giftes, whereof in
very dede, he hath none at all.
                     Suche loue in a man is not

to bee counted the loue of hym
selfe, but a blynde, beastly, and
inordinate loue of the bodye,
hurtfull both to hym selfe, and
to other. The whyche loue Socrates
conplained, to bee the originall
beginnyng of all mischeues.
For in dede this taketh
away frendshyp betweene man
and man, wherby aryse all, myserye,
all mischiefes amonges
men. He that ouermuche loueth
hym selfe after this maner, he
loueth no man, & no man hym.
                     The proude man agreeth not
with the meke, and muche lesse
with men of his owne disease.
                     Our sauiour, by his heauenly
wisedome, briefly declareth vnto

to loue, and what it is, a mā to

hate him selfe, saiyng after this
maner: He that hat

and dothe not suffer it to be intangled
with the pleasaunt intisementes
of the worlde, he
trewely loueth his soule, and
willeth it to be saued Contrary
wise, he that loueth his soule,
settyng it vppon voluptuousenesse,
the same hateth his soule,
and woll it com to nought.
                     Who, excepte he be madde,
woll refuse labour and peynes,
to obteine the rewarde eternall
in heauen, seing that these wretched
and transitorye thynges,
without great labour and peynes
can not be obteind?

and trouble.
                     Therfore we must ned is labor
what waie so euer we turne vs,
                     How much better than is it,
to endeuor with all our power,
to haue for our labor an ample
reward, as eternall ioy, than to
haue a sklender and a vile recō
                        pence,
that shortly vanysheth, &

that it is an easier surer qui

                     Syn is the deaeth of man, so
that he mai well seme to sle him
selfe, whiche falleth to syn, for
he withdraweth hym selfe from
God, our lyfe, and from the

quietnes of conscience, a thyng
moste blessed, most full of comforte
and ioye.
                     Thou shalt wasshe awaie the
spottes of synne with teares,
with repentance, and by the inuocacion
of the mercy of god,
cleauyng & holly trustyng to it.
                     Lette all maner of occasions
of synnes bee cut awaie and eschued
with all diligence. For
the wise man sayeth: He that
loueth peril, shal perishe therin.
                     And the dyuell alwayes wayteth
vppon all occasions, that
we can neuer be carelesse. We
muste warre with hym stylle:
mannes lyfe vpon earthe is, as
Iob truely seyeth, a continuall
warfare.
                     And for as muche as our ennemy

is so mighty, so stronge,
so subtyll, so craftye, and of so
great experience, hauyng so many
policies of warre agaynste
vs, that we can by no meanes,
craft, ne power, matche him: let
vs, castyng away all affiaunce
of our owne nature and power
flee vnto god for succour. For
this cause, our lorde ofte commandeth
his disciples to pray,
and desyre their holy Father,
with pure herte & mynde, that
they may not be ledde into temptacion,
that is to saie, into
fight, into hande grypes with
their aduersarie.
                     And in the praier, that he
taught vs, this is the last point,
which knitteth vp all togyther,
Ne nos inducas in tentationē,

Leade vs not into temptacion,
but deliuer vs from our aduersary,
that stille lieth in wayte
for vs.
                     Let vs therfore alwaies dooe
as men armed in warre, keping
diligent watche and ward, not
lettyng occasions slip away by
slepe and sluggishenes.

that no man lyuyng
to daie, can make sure promise

of foolyshenesse, and very dangerous,
in hope of long life, not
to prepare vs to our finall iorneie,
seyng that we ar called vpon
euery houre, and yet know
nothyng of the tyme, whan we
shalbe compelled to this iorney,

whether we woll or no. Let vs
therfore hast, to prepare vs tresure

alwaies redy with diligent attendance,

oppressed with heauy and

wherby we knowe god, and as

what is a man, but a beast immortall?

                     A man shoulde so knowe the
crafte of continence, that therwith

                     ¶Trouble is cause of paciēce,Paulus.
pacience maketh profe, proofe

he ought to lyue well in it, and
lyuyng well in it, howe he muste
gouerne, and gouernyng wysely,

                     A vertuouse man shoulde receyue

were thereto compelled: but he
that lacketh vertue, though he

                     HIgh authoritee is alway

to hold that, which thou

canste not welde.
                     They that wold excel all other
in a citee or cūtrey,Plutar. shuld allure
their inferiors with indifferencie,
gentylnes, and liberalitee:
And content great men with diligēce,

                     I Suppose this to bee the very
true lawe of amitee,August. a man
to loue his frende, no lesse

flattery than frendship.
                     In amitee the thing is not so
muche to bee sought for, as the
will and intēt, the tone betwene
men is oftentimes geuen, the to

the same thing to wyll or will

gotten, and loue neuer ioigned.
                     That is trewe frendship, that
loketh for nothyng of his frēd,

both for his owne sauegarde
and his: so an emperour muste
kepe such diligent watche, that
equitee and iustice be in suretee:
and so strongely repelle the vehemēt
waues of iniquitee, that
the 
                        •
                     ote of this worldely common
welth bee not frusshed and
broken with the waues of wickednesse.
                  Therfore we mortall men specially 
are taught and instructed
with holy scripture, to knowe

our selfe. For who that knoweth
hym selfe, shal know god:
and he that knoweth god, shall
be likened to god: truly he shall
be likned to god, that is goddes
seruant: he is goddes seruant,
that doth nothynge contrary to
goddes cōmandement, but that
he thynketh bee perteinynge to
god: he speaketh as he thinketh,
and doth as he speaketh: which
thyng no man maie doe effectually,
without perpetuall contynuance
in goodnes.
                  
                      No man shoulde glorify or delyte
in the nobilitee of his kynred.
For why, bothe ryche and
poore be ingendred or earthe.
                  Therfore no man ought to exalte
& preyse his vile and earthly
kynred, but only glorify and reioye

in good & godly maners.
                  O man, loke and know thou,
that the higher thou art by goddes
helpe in dignitee: so muche
thou art more in his dette: therfore
thanke thy benefactoure
therof, whiche accepteth that is
due to hym as merite, & for frend
shyppe doth frendshyppe: God
is always the first that gyueth,
and yet as he were our detter,
he quiteth agayne our goodnesse
to hym shewed, onely requiryng
for his gentilnesse and
kyndenesse to vs, effectuall loue
and thankes.
                  Truely there is nothyng that 
maketh a man so commendable
or preise worthy, as to do that
he desyreth to doe: and to wyl &
do, that is good and rightouse.

Consyderyng than, that this
power is gyuen the by almyghty
god, of the whiche in our behalfe
thou hadst greattest nede:
thou shalte wyll and dooe no
thynge, but as god (that hathe
gyuen the suche facultee and power)
willeth and commandeth.
For truly nothyng is more plesant
both to god and man, thā
to doe iustice.
                  
                      The vnstedfastnesse of these
worldely richesse ensue and folowe
the course of flowyng waters,
whiche rychesse he shall
possesse and enioy but a while,
that thinketh hym selfe of them
most sure. For shortely after,
with the fallynge water, they
wyll leaue him, and enriche som
other. Therfore good and mercifull

dedes be to man most sure
and stedfaste: for the merite of
them returneth euermore to the
profit of the good dede dooers.
                  Bicause of this high & worldly 
empyre, thou art harde to be
spoken with all: and yet by reason
if suche power, thou shouldest
humiliate thy selfe: & therefore
the spedylye
                        •
                      admyt poore
men to thy speche and presence.
Thou shalt therfore the sooner
(folowing goddes rules) listē to
poore men, that god may in thy
necessitee bothe kyndly harken
to the, and also helpe the. For
loke how we order other, so of
god we shall be ordred.
                  The pensifull and troubled 
mynde of an emperour muste be
euermore as pure as the glasse,

that so it maie by diuyne and
godly lyghte, continually glister
and shyne: and also that he by
quietnesse of mynde may learne
distincte and true knowlage of
thynges. For truely there is nothyng
that causeth man so well
to marke and beholde what is
to be doone, as a quiete mynde
and clere conscience.
                  
                      Lyke as the mariner, a littell
goynge out of course, hurteth
and is noiful to those that saile
with hym: and as the shyppe by
negligence of the gouernor, perisheth
& goth to wracke: euē so
do the citces. For if a subiect do
amisse, he hurteth him selfe more
greuousely than the welth publyke:
but whan the ruler, the gouernour
or prynce mysdooeth,

he hurteth the holl cōminaltee,
Therfore 
                        •
                     oeasmuch as he must
gyue a strayte counte, if he rule
not well: it were nedefull, that
he with exquisite diligence both
speake and do euery thyng, and
so auoide all danger.
                  The cercle and whele of these 
worldly thynges be often times
turned, the which at turned somtyme
this waie, sometyme that
way. Truely in these thynges is
no equalitee: for in theim is neyther
constance nor yet any sure
foundacion. Therfore O moste
myghty Emperour, emonge
these thaungeable mouynges,
and vnstedynesse of thynges,
looke that thou haue a stedfast
thought and mynde, with true
feythe and pitee.
                  
                     
                      Thou shalt flee & withstande
the enticyng communicacion of
flatterers, as thou wouldeste
eschewe a sort of rauenyng crowes.
For crowes pecke out the
corporalle eyes: but flatterers
blynde the vnderstandynge of
mans soule, whan they will not
suffre hym to perceiue the trouthe
of thynges: For either they
preise thynges that are worthy
to be dispreised, or els dispreise
thynges most worthy to be preised:
so that one of these two
muste nedes folowe, that is, either
the cōmendacion and laude
of yll and wycked caytiues, or
els the contempte and dispreise
of good men.
                  
                      An emperours mynde muste
alwaie be constant. For why, to

chaunge with euery waueryng
and vnstedfaste thynge, is a token
of an inconstaunt mynde.
Therfore thou shouldest cleaue
and affixe thy selfe to good and
vertuous men, whiche shall stablysshe
and make stedfaste thy
kyngedome and empyre. Nor
thou shouldest not proudely eleuate
thy selfe, nor yet without
reason to muche submitte thy
selfe: but prudentely after the
vse and custome of wise menne,
surely to grounde the in constance.
For who so euer groundly
thynketh vpon the deceitfulnesse
of this lyfe, and will also
beholde the vilenesse and shortnesse
therof: considerynge farthermore
the bodily filthinesse,
he wyl neuer waxe proude, be he

in neuer so high a dignitee.
                  
                      Aboue all other precious ornamentes
that any kyngedome
hath, the crowne of pitee and of
diuine seruice doeth most hyght
and ornate a kynges and an emperours
maiestee. For why, erthely
rychesse, fouour of the comminaltee,
laude and preise door
soone vanisshe awaie, but the
glorye of good and vertuouse
lyfe, is immortal, and shal neuer
be forgotie.
                  
                      Me thinke it muche vnconneniente,
that the poore man and
the riche shuld suffre lyke harme
by contrary and diuers causes:
The riche by abundaunce and
great welfare at corrupted: the
poore perysshe the roughe famyne
and scarcitee. Farthermore,

thy ryche possesseth all the
worlde, the poore man hath not
where he may set his foote.
                  Therfore, to thentent that they
bothe maie be holpe, they muste
be ruled by deduction, that is,
the riche must giue to the poore,
and so the inequalitee shall bee
brought to equalitee.
                  The tyme and season of prosperous 
lyfe, whiche certayne
olde prophetes dyd pronostycate
shoulde come, whan wyse
men should gouerne and rule, or
kynges waxe philosophere, is
now manifested & opened: For
truely you geuing nowe and appliyng
your selfe to phylosophy
and wisedom, are esteemed worthy
to bee r
                        ••
                     ers: but specially
whan in your auctoritee and

gouernyng, ye decline not from
reason and wisedome. For yf
to loue wysedome maketh the
philosopher,Psal. 110. and the beginnyng
of wisedom is the feare of god,
whiche by muste euermore remembre:
who can saie, but my
writynge is true, and as cleere
as true.
                  
                      For certayne we affirme the
to be an emperour, seeyng thou
wilt ouercome and subdue thy
voluptuous pleasures. And thā
thou art crowned with the diademe
of chastitee, and thā thou
shewest thy self arraied with the
purpull robe of Iustice. As for
all other thynges vanyshe awaie,
these vertues bee immortall:
all other pleasures and
worldly dignitees peryshe: but

as these vertues be farre from
all peri
                        ••
                     e, so they bee euerlastyng.
                  ¶If thou wilt be beloued and 
honoured of all men, loke thou
healpe all men. For certainely
there is nothyng that causeth a
man to be beloued and honoured
so soone, as to healpe and
succour poore men: for the cappyng
and knelyng that is done
for feare, is fucate and figured
flattery of feigned honour.
                  Thy empyre by all ryght and 
reason is therfore the more worthy
to bee honoured and preysed,
that it feareth and keepeth
his ennemies vnder: and shewing
to his subiectes all kyndnesse,
kepeth them in good prosperitee.
Therfore, as it ouercometh

his ennemies by strengthe
of armis, so his subiectes by
charitee & good loue surmounte
and ouercome his gentylnesse
and goodnesse: Truly betwene
these .ii. kyndes of humanitee &
loue is no more difference, than
is betwene the tame sheepe and
other wylde beastes.
                  
                      Though an emperour in body
be lyke all other, yet in power
he is lyke God, and mayster of
all men. For in earthe he hathe
no peere. Therfore as god, bee
thou neuer chafed or angry: as
man, be thou neuer proude: For
thoughe thou bee lyke God in
face, yet for al that thou art but
erthe, whiche thyng teacheth the
to be equall to euery man.
                  
                      Accept and fauour theim that

geue the good counsail, but not
those that flatter the: good coū
                     sailours
consider, what ought
to be done: flatters consider,
what may please men of might:
which 
                        •
                     latterers are lyke mens
shadowes: For they gaynsaie
nothyng, but alowe and preise
what euer is saied.
                  Be so to thyne, as thou woldest 
that god shoulde bee to the,
For as we heare other, so wee
shalbe herde
                        •
                      and as we fauour
                        •
                     
other, so God will fauour vs.
Therfore let vs first shew mercy
& be merciful, that in like maner
we maie obteine mercy.
                  As a fayre glasse expresseth the 
very true phisnomy of mā, that
is, to goodly & beautifull persones
their beautifulnesse, and of

yll fauoured theyr yll fauour
                        •
                     
so the rightousnesse and equitee
of God is likened to our deedes.
For after our deeces, God
will rewarde vs.
                  
                      Doo that ye intende coldely,
but yet doo it speedily, that ye
purpose to dooe. For foolysshe
hastynesse in euery thyng is vera
                        •
                     e
perillous. Truely, who
that marketh diligently, what
myschyefe ryseth of hastinesse,
shall soone perceiue, and lykewyse
vnderstande the commoditee
of good counsaile, as sick
folke after theyr sickenesse vnderstande
the pleasure of helth:
Therfore most prudent prince,
with sage counsayle, & deuoute
praiers made to god, loke thou
diligently, serche and inquere,

what shal be profitable for the,
to rule and gouerne this world.
                  Thou shalte best gouerne thy 
noble empyre, yf thou ouersee
all thynges thy selfe, and suffre
nothynge negligently to passe.
Nor it is not a small thynge in
the, that in comparison to thy
subiectes appereth to bee small.
For the leaste woorde of an emperoure,
is amonge all folkes
ryghte highly esteemed, and of
great auctoritee.
                  Because there is no erthely 
man, that can constreigne the
to obserue and kepe thy lawes,
enforce thy selfe to vse and kepe
theym. For yf thou diligen
                        •
                     ely
obserue theym, thou shalt manifestely
shewe, that the lawe is
worthy to be obserued, and the

breaker of it, worthy to be punyshed.
                  
                      It is one thyng to synne, and
not to chastice synners. For
who so euer dwelleth in a citee,
and therin suffereth wycked lyuers,
before god he is an yll lyuer.
Therefore if thou wilt bee
estemed to be indifferent, honor
theym that do well, and punishe
theym that doo yll.
                  
                      I thynke it very expedient, to
eschue yll company. For who
that is conuersante with yll
liuers, shal either suffre harm or
lerne som yll. But he that ledeth
his life among good and honest
company, either he shall learne
to folowe honestie, or els to deminysshe
his fautes and vices.
                  
                      Sith it is so, that god hath giuen

to the, rule of all the world,
loke thou vse no yl officers For
he that promoteth them, shal answer
for their offēces. 
                        •
                     herfore
great offices must bee diligently
geuē, & wel and wisely bestowed
                  I esteme these two thynges to 
be lyke yll, to be chafed with the
leude deling of our enemy, or to
be mollified with the pleasaunt
swete words of our frends. For
we ought to resist 
                        •
                      and withstād
theym bothe, that is, neuer to
decline from comlynesse, nother
in reuengeyng the vnreasonable
yll wyll of our foes, nor in rewarding
the feigned beneuolēce
of our frede and louer.
                  Esteme not those thy feithfull 
freendes, that wyll preyse all
thynges that thou speakest, but

those, which without any f
                        •

dooe all that they can for
the: and bee glad and reioyce,
whan thou saiest or dooest any
thyng well: and ageine be sory
and heauy, yf thou dooe or saie
any thyng yll. For certayn these
be tokens of frendshyp, abhorryng
all fraude.
                  
                      Leat not the greatnesse and
myght of this thy earthely empyre
chaunge thy noble mynde,
but rulynge thy frayle empyre,
subiect to diuers fortunes, haue
amonge these mutable thynges,
a stedfast and immutable mind,
not liftynge vp thy selfe by to
muche ioye, nor yet hurtyng thy
selfe by to muche heuynesse and
sorow, For like as gold, though
it by craft and witte of man be

tourned nowe thus now otherwise,
and wroughte in dyuerse
facions of ornamentes: yet it
remaineth golde still, nor wyll
not bee chaunged from his nature:
So thy selfe (moste noble
emperour) though from grice to
grice hast borne one office after
an other, and arte come to the
mos
                        •
                     e highest honour: yet thou
remaynest the same thyng thou
were. Kepe thou therfore amōg
these diuersitees of thynges, an
vnalterable & a constant mynd,
the whiche from this worldely
empire shall bryng the to perpetuall
blysse and ioy euerlasting.
                  If thou wylt haue the dominion 
of thy empire commended,
deme thyne own offēces as worthy
punyshement, as the defautes

of thy subiectes. For in this
worlde no man, but only thyne
owne consciēce, can punish the.
                  
                      He that obteineth high power
and dignitee, should ensue and
folowe (as nere as he maie) the
gyuer therof. For if themperour
represent God, lord of al thing,
and by his liberalitee hath the
gouernaunce of euery thyng, he
than (but namely in this poynt)
shall folowe hym, and esteme no
erthly thynge so precious, or so
muche of man to be desyred, as
to be mylde and mercifull.
                  
                      Aboue golde & precious stone
we shuld lay vp (as tresure) the
richesse of well doyng. For they

of the fruicion to come, will delite
vs: and in the life to com, by

experience & caste of euerlastyng
ioy, they shalbe to vs swete and
pleasant. These world
                        ••
                     y thynges,
that seme to vs pleasaunt,
shulde be eschued and vtterly auoided,
as vnmete, & nothynge
perteynyng to vs, that they by
inticement disceiue vs not.
                  Loke thou quite thē with gay 
rewards, which with good wyl
do thy cōmandementes. For by
that mean thou shalt increce the
corage of good mē, and teche yl
doers to lament their offences.
For it were to much vniust dealyng,
to reward alike aswel thē
that deserued not, as deserued it
                  Thā truely thempire excedeth
all other thynges, whan the ruler
therof enclineth not to vndiscreete
rygoure, but to amyable

equitee and iustice, fleeyng
beastly cruelnesse, and ensuyng
Godly kyndnesse.
                  
                      As well thou shalt iudge right
fully thy ennemy as thy frende,
not fauourynge thy frende for
frendshyp, nor hurtyng thy ennemy
for hatred. For it is a lyke
inconuenience and offence, to
helpe thy frende, desyryng that
is agaynste equitee, as it is to
hurte thy ennemie, demaundyng
iustice: the misdede in bothe cases
is lyke, though the persones
be dyuers.
                  
                      Iudges muste diligently harken
to theyr causes. For it is a
very hard thyng, brefely to perceiue
the troth, the whiche from
negligent persones soone eskapeth.
But if a ryghtfull iudge

wil leaue the feigned eloquence
of atturneis, and consideryng
the true entencion, will flee the
likelyhoode of causes, he shall
shortely perceiue the troth. And
farthermore auoide two diuers
fautes, that is, they shall neyther
dooe, nor yet permitte any
other to doo agaynste honestee.
                  Thoughe thou haue as many 
vertues as be sterres in the firmament,
yet thou shalt neuer ouercome
the goodnesse of god.
                  For what so euer wee offer to
God, wee offer to hym but his
owne. And as no man can go
fro, or before his shadow in the
son, alway goyng afore or nere
folowyng hym: so the goodnes
of god is insuperable, & can not
he exceded with good woorkes

of any man.
                  
                      The treasure of liberalitee is
infinite. For who that lyberally
spendeth, getteth, and spendyng
his goodes, other gather theim.
Loke than (most liberall emperoure)
that thou mynde those
thynges) and that thou gyue
largely to poore men. For whan
the tyme of rewardes & thankes
shall come, than for this thy liberalitee,
thou shalte haue infinite
thankes and great lucre.
                  
                      Seyng thou haste obteyned &
gotten thy kyngdom by god, folow
thou hym in all good workes,
that men may knowe thy
liberalitee. For thou art of the
numbre of theim, that maie doo
good, and not of pore men, and
those that couer to be holpen.
                  
                     For god therfore hath giuen the
so abundant richesse, to hea
                        •
                     pe
and succour poore men.
                  An emperour is no otherwise 
ordeigned to rule the worlde,
than mans eies to rule & watche
for the sauegarde of his body.
                  He is deputed of god to mynister
those thynges, that may be
profitable for man. Therefore
an emperour ought to doe none
other wise for all men, than he
wolde doe for hym selfe: that so
by his tuicion they may auoyde
all daungiers, and prospere in
goodnesse.
                  Thynke thou the moste sure 
defence of thy prosperitee, to
hurt nor to iniury no man. For
he that offendeth no mā, suspecteth
no man. If than to iniury

no man dooeth cause good custody
and safegarde: than truly
by liberalitee thou shalte the
sooner obteine it. For as liberalitee
getteth and engendreth
defence: so it conserueth good
and honest loue. For if we doo
that is honeste, men wyll loue
and kepe vs.
                  
                      Be thou (o most mekest emperoure)
to thy subiestes, through
thy excellēt power, terrible: and
by thy liberalitee and goodnes,
be thou amiable. Nor thou shuldeste
not, by to muche fauoure,
set at light and nothing regarde
thy high power: nor yet regardyng
to muche thy power, despise
fauoure. But keepynge a
meane, thou shalt as wel shewe
louely kyndnesse to thy subiectes,

as by austeritee and sharpnesse
chastise to greatte familiaritee.
                  Suche thynges as thou by 
word doest prescribe to thy subiectes,
loke by example of pure
lyfe thou accomblisshe. For yf
thou doo reason, and with reason
dooste lyue as thou sayest,
euery man shall greattely commende
the.
                  Loue theym moste (noble emperoure)
that mekely desyre thy
gyftes, more than those, which
diligētly desyre to geue the giftes.
For these thou art bounde
to thanke, and also to rewarde
theym: the other trewly shall assigne
god to thanke the, whiche
reputeth to bee gyuen to hym,
and for his loue what so euer is

gyuen or doone for poore men.
                  
                      The vertue of the sonne is to
illuminate the worlde, themperours
vertue is to be mercifull,
and to helpe poore men. Truly
a meke and a merciful prince excedeth
the brightnes of the son,
for the soonne gyueth place to
the night, but a good vertuous
prince suffreth no extorcion, but
by the light of trouthe & iustice,
he chastiseth iniquitee.
                  
                      Thy predecessors haue greatlye
ornated theyr empyre, but
thou truely by thy humanitee &
affabilitee, not esteming thy rial
and mighty
                        •
                      power, hast muche
more greatly ornated it. Wherfore
all they, that neede mercy,
renne to thy grace: whiche delyuered
from their pouertee & aduersitee,

doo highly thanke the.
                  Loke howe muche thou excellest 
all other in power and dignitee,
so muche the more thou
shuldest endeuour the, by noble
and vertuous dedes, to excell &
shyne aboue all other. For high
power requireth great honesty.
God also wyi require, that thou
helpeafter thy power nedefull &
honest persōs. 
                        •
                     herfore, if thou
desire to be truly preised, & to be
by god, as it were by a trompetour
declared a conqueror: ioyn
thou to the crown o
                        •
                      thy inuincible
empyre (by helpīg the pore)
the crowne of euerlastyng ioye.
                  Ere thou commaunde, that 
ryght and 
                        •
                     quitee perswadeth,
loke well vpon it. For verely so
thou shalt euermore commande

Therefore, if thou prefix to
the foresaide instrument, that is
goodly and honest, it shal soūde
only that is pleasant, and right
to be executed and done.
                  
                      A prince in all thynges muste
be subtile and wise, but namely
in iudgeyng of grat and weighty
causes, seldome angry, land
not to be angry without a great
cause. But because neuer to be
angry is not laudable, an emperour
to refrayne the furiousnes
of misdoers, and that men may
purge theyr fautes, shall measurably
vse his anger.
                  
                      Loke thou be diligēt to know

                      Euery man, that desireth his
helthe, muste call vpon god, but

laboureth for the welthe of all

                      God nedeth nothyng, An emperour
hath only nede of god.
                  Therfore folowe him that hath
no nede, and shewe mercy abundantly
to them that aske it, not
reckenyng streightly thy expences
of householde: but rather
healpe euery man that desyreth
to lyue. For it is better to helpe
the vnworthy for honest mens
sakes, than for the vyce of the
vnworthy to defraude the worthy
of that they deserued.
                  
                      As thou woldest haue forgiuenesse

of thy synnes, so forgeue

and that he bee ashamed

example to other to doo amisse,
and that he absteyne priuately,
leste he offende openly. For if
subiectes be ashamed to dooe amysse,
muche more their ruler
ought to be ashamed.
                  It is a priuate mans vice to 
doo yll, and liue viciousely: but
a prince to forgette hys owne
wealthe and honestee, is muche
more vicious. For the abstinēce

from yll, doeth not in stify man,
but the dooyng of honestee and
goodnes. Therfore no mā shuld

endeuour hym to do iustice.

                      As an emperour is lorde of all
men, so with al other he is goddis
seruant. And shall than bee

of chastitee ouercometh his

mynde despiseth the transiry

plesures & ioys of this word.
