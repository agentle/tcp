            ¶ To the Reader.
            
               BEing openlye defamed, in writing ſet abroade by one that hath no name: I ſuffered y• ſame, long time to delite himſelf in his own blindneſſe, and to boaſt himſelfe among hys ſecreto maintayners, being in y• meane while better occupied, thā in wreſtling with ſuche a one as is aſhamed to ſet his name to the booke he writeth, and cauſeth to be imprinted.
            I thought that the writings of ſuch one, coulde not haue bene hurtfull to the eſtimation that I and others of my calling, ſhould of right haue among the true profeſſors of Gods Goſpell: bicauſe ſuch haue inough alredie in print, and in the Engliſh tong, to aunſwere all ſuch blind barking dogs as this is. But perceiuing that ſome men which profeſſe the Goſpell, will rather credit ſuch a Rayler, than take the paynes to reade that, wherin they might haue wherewith to be able to anſwere for vs that are rayled vpon, bycauſe the ſame was written, before thys Hell Dogge began to barke: I haue now written a ſhort Apologie, or defence of my ſelfe and others of my calling, whom this Hell hound doth ſo egerly barke at: willing the Chriſtian reader, to reade it with indifferent iudgement, neyther inclining to the one nor the other, till he haue read both. And bicauſe none ſhall haue cauſe to complaine: I haue ſet downe in writing all that this

Dogge hath written, and then defēded that which he findeth fault withall, ſo that euerie matter hath it manifeſt defence ioyned vnto it, that the Chriſtian Reader, may haue wherewithall to bring himſelfe out of doubt. And leaſt any ſhoulde be offended, for that I terme mine aduerſarie by ye name of Cerberus or Hell dogge: I wold all men ſhould conſider the cauſe. He hath takē vpon him to reprehend the teachers of the truth, and thoſe, which are or ſhould be, the light of the worlde: and yet, as one that would not be called to an accompt of his doings, he hideth his name. Wherefore, I haue giuen him ſuche a name, as is méete for him: tyll he put hys name to that he writeth in the reproche and diſcredite of ſuch as feare not openly to teach the truth, and when they write it, to ſubſcribe their names to the ſame. When this Hel hound therefore ſhall ſet his name to his booke: I will vſe none other name but that which by his owne writing ſhal appeare to be his. In the meane while, let him & his friends be contented that he beare ſuch a name, as hys doings do deſerue. Cerberus as ye Poets do faine, is a Dogge with thrée heades, which watcheth Hell gates, whoſe barking is horrible, for he barketh with chrée mouthes, and his haires are ſnakes. His name by interpretation doth ſignifie a deuourer of bodies. Wherefore, it is not a name vile inough for this Hel dogge, whoſe propertie is to deuour ſoules, and the good names of ſuch as he is not able to accuſe of any crime. And wyth his barking he goeth not about to trouble the Kingdome of Hel (as Cerberus did) but the Kingdome of Heauen, which is the Church of Chriſt, which by faith in Chriſt, is aſſured of hir eternall Predeſtination to euerlaſting glorie after this life, and in this life to deliueraunce from all euill. Of which comfort this Cerberus laboureth by his barking to ſpoile hir: as ſhall more plainely appeare in the Apologie of

thoſe, whom he ſeketh by his barking to daſh out of coū
               tenance.
            But leaſt I ſhould trouble thée Chriſtiā Reader, with ouer manie wordes before the matter: I ceaſſe to write any more. Farewel in Chriſt Ieſus. And pray to God for the preſence of his holie ſpirite, to leade thée in the reading of this Apologie. Amen. Finiſhed the firſt of March Anno. 1565.

            An Apologie of Crowley and others.
            
               Cerberus.
               
                  THE Copie of an Aunſwere, made vnto a certaine letter: wherein the Aunſwerer purgeth himſelfe and other, from Pelagius errours, and frō the errour of free will or iuſtification of workes: wherewithall he ſemeth to be charged, by the ſayde letter: And further he ſheweth, wherin he differeth in iudgement, from certaine Engliſhe writers and Preachers, whome he chargeth with the teaching of falſe doctrine, vnder the name of Predeſtination.
            
            
               Crowley.
               
                  IT had bene very well done of Cerberus to haue ſet downe in writing the copie of the letter that he ſayth he Aunſwereth, and the name of him that wrote it: ſo might thoſe that he nameth in hys aunſwere, haue had ſome waye to haue founde out the Auctour of the Aunſwere, that this matter being debated priuatelye betwéene them, a meane might haue bene founde for the ending of the controuerſie and the ſatiſfying of ſuche as by this aunſwere are not onely brought into doubt, of the truth of Gods euerlaſting Predeſtination: but alſo haue conceyued an euill opinion of ſuch as be the teachers therof. But if I ſhall ſpeake that I thinke: I muſte néedes ſaye, that I thinke there was no ſuch letter written. But Cerberus
                  
hath ſayued this, as a grounde to ſet his foundation vpō. For otherwiſe it ſhoulde haue ſemed too too maliciouſly done, vpon none occaſion to write and ſet abrode in print to the diſfamation of publique Preachers and writers: ſuch matter as in this aunſwere he chargeth them withall. But graunt there were ſuch a letter written: yet was not that a iuſte occaſion for Cerberus to charge by name, mée or anye other, which knewe not of the writing of it. Well, he purgeth himſelfe and other, he ſayth, of diuers errours wherewith he ſemeth to be charged in that letter. It had bene well, he had not in purging himſelfe charged other, that muſte fall to purging too. But that was to ſhewe what ſpirite he is of. Not of that ſpirite which in loue ſéeketh the reformation of other mens errours: but of that ſpirite that in malice ſeketh to maintaine his owne errours by the defacing of other, which neuertheleſſe, will in the ende, be the defacing of himſelfe. For ſuch as vſe to digge pittes for others to fall into: doe commonly fall into the ſame themſelues fyrſt of all.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               I deſire of God by his grace and mercy, to ſettle, ſtrength, and ſtabliſhe you in the truth of his holye Worde for euer. Dearely beloued, where you write vnto me, that you haue often hearde, that I and other, ſhoulde holde the errours of Pelagius: whoſe errours you ſay are almoſt vnknowen vnto you what they are. And where further it is reported of vs (as you ſaye) that we ſhoulde denie the predeſtination of God: and ſeeke a iuſtification by free will, and by deſeruing of workes, which matter you do both vnderſtande, and haue alſo founde good proufe (as you ſuppoſe) that we are giltie in the ſame, laying

the whole foundation of your proufe, vpon this ſaying ſet forth in print.
               
                  Although there be but fewe on earth, that rightly thee deſerue:
                  Yet thou, O Lorde, for their good lyfe, the reſidue preſerue.
               
               With which filthy ſaying, to burden me and other whome ye name: I maruell greatly that you coulde be ſo much abuſed, not conſidering by whom it was written, and ſet forth in print: for by the titling you ſee, it was printed beyonde the ſeas, in Queene Maries time, for that it is entitled, A prayer to God for his afflicted Church in Englande, and as it there appeareth manifeſt, it is the worke of W. Samuell, which is a mā vnto me of very ſmall acquaintance: but a Preacher he is. And as for his ſaying, that a man may deſerue God. &c. Which you deſire me to proue if I can: it is a doctrine ſo abhominable and blaſphemous: as I am ſure neither Papiſt, nor Pelagian, nor any other Heretike, eyther olde or newe, hath written or maintained, a more filthy, and execrable ſaying. For it is the flatte and manifeſt deniall both of God the Father & of his Sonne Chriſt Ieſu: neither doth it require any confutation to him that doth but confeſſe, that there is a God: and as for my ſelfe, I aſſure you: I doe not loue my lyfe ſo dearely, as I hate this vile ſaying deadlye. But wonder it is, that ſuch a ſentence, conteyning the very filthy dregs, of all Pelagius errours, coulde ſo long ſtande printed, and neither be forbidden, nor by any man written againſt.
            
            
               Crowley.
               I lyke very well, the Prayer that Cerberus beginneth his Oration withall: but his purpoſe in praying

(which appeareth to be, to deceiue the ſimple) I doe lyke nothing at all. The foundation of his friendes proufe of that he chargeth him with (as he ſayth) is but ſlender: for it is but a fault in the print, as euery mā may ſée that will reade but two verſes going before in ye ſame prayer, and ſixe immediately following. And that the indifferent reader may be ſatiſfyed, I will write downe thoſe verſes, bicauſe it will be harde for men to finde the bookes wherein the Prayer is printed.
               
                  Of all the Sonnes that thou haſt had, but one thou doeſt regarde:
                  And for his ſake thou art content, that we ſhall be preſerude.
                  So, though there be but fewe on earth, that rightly thee deſerue:
                  Yet thou, O Lorde, for their good lyfe, the reſidue preſerue.
                  If ten in Sodome had bene founde, the Citie ſtill had ſtande:
                  And had remained without fall as did the other lande.
                  And let not now thy mercies ſlacke, but be thou alwayes one:
                  And haue reſpect vnto all thoſe, that truſt to thee alone.
                  Thoſe, whome thou haſt in priſon layde, for breaking of thy lawe.
                  Deliuer them and giue them grace, to liue in better awe.
               
               If any of Cerberus friendes had bene Auctour of thys Prayer: he woulde ſone haue eſpied the printers fault, and would haue read thoſe two verſes thus.
               
                  So, though there be but fewe on earth, that rightly thee doe ſerue:
                  Yet thou, O Lorde, for their goodlyfe, the reſidue preſerue.
               
               And ſo ſhould the ſaying haue bene no more filthy, than was the ſaying of Abraham to the Aungell, when he entreated for the Citie of Sodome, and ſayde: What if there lacke fiue of fiftie, wilt thou deſtroy the whole Citie for lack of ſiue? Or the ſaying of the Aungell, when aunſwering Abraham he ſayde: If I finde but ten iuſt Gene. 18. men in the Citie, I will ſpare it for their ſakes. But Cerberus was ſo bent to barke at the Preachers of preveſtination, that he coulde not haue leyſure to reade more than ye title and thoſe two verſes, which being corrupted

in printing, ſemed to ſerue his purpoſe. And ſurely, I doe not yet beleue that any man coulde be ſo madde as to charge him with thoſe verſes. But this I beleue, that he hath written them otherwiſe than they were printed. For the firſt verſe beginning thus: So, though. &c. he hath written it thus. Although. &c. which argueth that either he neuer ſawe the booke that Samuell made, or elſe, he ſuppoſed that none ſhoulde come to the ſight of it, but ſuch as doe fauour his faction. And in very deede ſome of them haue made verye ſtraunge to ſhewe that booke. But how ſo euer ye matter go otherwiſe, he hath ſhamefully deceiued himſelfe in triumphing ouer poore Samuell, as ouer him whome he compareth with the moſte wicked Heretiques that euer were.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               And although I denie not but ſome other there are, which (maintaining the power of mans freewil, & the meritorious worthineſſe of mans deſeruing) doe denie the free gift of Gods grace in Chriſt Ieſu, and for his only ſake, comprehended in the eternall predeſtination, and foreordinaunce of God, and declared vnto vs in his moſte holy Worde, yet bycauſe I ſee, there are many in theſe dayes, wrongfully and falſely, accuſed to be enimies of that bleſſed Predeſtination, to be Pelagians, iuſtifiers of themſelues, and ſuch lyke: And with thoſe bitter termes, are in open Auditories defaced, and brought into contempt, emong the multitude (who being deceiued with giuing ouerhaſtie credite, vnto ſuch men, not throughly vnderſtanding the matter, doe vſe to giue ſentence, before the cauſe be hearde,) I haue thought it good therfore, moſt dearely beloued, not

to them which take more delight in the defamation of other, than in knowing the truth themſelues, but to thee, which art willing to vnderſtande the matter, before thou iuſtifie or condemne either partie: in as fewe wordes as I poſſible can, to ſhewe what ſhamefull doctrine, vnder the name and colour of Gods Predeſtination, is now adayes ſet forth and taught of many, which both I and many other miſlike, and haue diuers times with ſome of them in priuate and friendely talke, perſuaded to leaue, both by cauſe we iudge the doctrine to be falſe, and alſo the diſtruction of all vertue to followe therevpon. For which cauſe, as the maner is of them that feare not ſo much the ſhipwrack of a good conſcience, as they doe the loſſe of worldly eſtimation, leaſt any ſuch diffauorers of their fantaſie, ſhoulde hap to haue ſome credit among the people, with boyſtrous breath, they blowe abroade, that the miſlikers of this their doctrine, are enimies to Gods holy Predeſtination. But right well knowe they, that thoſe whome they nowe ſo ſpecially accuſe, to be ſuch haters of Gods Predeſtination, are in dede, moſt intire louers of the ſame. And many of thoſe whom they accuſe to be popiſhe Pelagians and Iuſtifiers of themſelues: haue beſtowed both their goodes and lyues, againſt that filthy and deteſtable ſect And as for thoſe errours which Pelagius that olde heretike, with Celestinus and Iulianus his adherentes, did hold, and alſo reuoked the ſame in the Iudiciall counſell of Palaeſtine: I think it good to rehearſe them: firſt in Latine & after in Engliſhe, as they are gathered togither by Auguſtine. And thē to ſhewe, according to your requeſt, what parte of their doctrine which they teache vnder the name of Predeſtination, my ſelfe and other doe miſlyke. To

the ende that you and other may the better iudge, who are in deede worthy to be called Pelagians: and whether ſome parte of their doctrine, be not for iuſt cauſe miſliked.

               Here Cerberus vſeth all his Retorique at once, to perſuade his dearely beloued friend, whoſe letter he ſayth he aunſwereth, that he and other of his minde be falſely and wrongfully accuſed to be enimies of Gods holy predeſtinatiō. &c. And to this ende he will in as fewe words, as poſſibly he can, ſet forth what ſhamefull doctrine is now taught. &c. But firſt he will ſet forth both in Latine and in Engliſhe, thoſe errours which the olde Heritike Pelagius, with other did holde and alſo reuoke. &c. That men may the better iudge, who are in deede worthy the name of Pelagians, (for he thinketh that he hath proued that we againſt whom he writeth, are thoſe that ſhould be called Pelagians) and whether ſome parte of oure doctrine be not for iuſte cauſe miſliked. Now let vs ſée how he noteth Pelagius errours out of Auguſtine, firſt in Latine, and then in Engliſhe. Which when we haue weighed, we ſhall ſée who are moſte lyke Pelagius, he & his, or I and mine. For this is his purpoſe, I am ſure, for that he toucheth me firſt by name, and ſetteth himſelf and ſuch as he is againſt al ſuch as I am, affirming that whereas we accuſe them as enimies of Gods Predeſtination, they are in déede ye moſt intire louers and we the enimies therof. My chief labor therfore in this Apologie, ſhall be to make the truth hereof to appeare playnely to all the indifferent hearers.

               The firſt of Pelagius errours which Auguſtine here citeth is, that Adam ſhoulde haue died whether he had ſinned or not ſinned. This is as you heare, one of Pelagius wicked errours, that ſinne is not the cauſe of Reprobation, or caſting away, death ſprong out of Gods ordinance, or ſome other way & came not of mans ſinne (ſaith he) whether man had ſinned or not ſinned, yet ſhould he haue dyed, contrary to the manifeſt Scripture which ſayeth, that by one man ſinne entred into the worlde, & death by the meanes of ſinne. Roma. 5. b. And the wyſe man ſayth, that God Rom. 5. b.
                  
created mā to be vndeſtroyed. And againe he ſaith. Sapiae. God hath not made death, neither hath he pleaſure in the deſtruction of the liuing, he created al things that they might haue their being, yea all the people of the earth hath he made, that they ſhoulde haue health, that there ſhould be no deſtruction in them, and that the Kingdome of Hell ſhould not be vpon earth, for righteouſneſſe is euerlaſting and immortall, but vnrighteouſeneſſe bringeth death. Wicked and abhominable therfore was this errour of Pelagius which affirmeth, that whether man had ſinned or not ſinned: he ſhoulde haue dyed.
               And here in the very beginning of Pelagius errours: I reporte me to themſelues, euen to themſelues (I ſaye) that blowe the trumpet of defamation againſt other, with the termes of peſtilent Pelagians, whether thoſe, whome they ſo accuſe nowe to be Pelagians, holde this errour, or whether they themſelues which woulde take ſome mote of errour out of other mens eyes, haue not this Pelagius beame ſticking faſt in their owne, let they themſelues be iudges, or let their owne doctrine iudge, both in print and preaching, whereof ſome parte ſhall be hereafter rehearſed. Yea let all the worlde iudge, which haue hearde the doctrine of both parties: who they are that in this point ought worthily to be called Pelagians.
            
            
               Crowley.
               After Cerberus hath ſet downe in Latine certaine of Pelagius errors, to ye number of .xi. he repeteth ye firſt in Engliſhe, that is, that Adam ſhould haue dyed, though he had not ſinned. And bycauſe his purpoſe is to proue that we are thoſe that holde this Pelagian hereſie: he

vnderſtandeth Pelagius meaning to be, that ſinne was not the cauſe of Reprobation, or caſting away, but that heath ſprong out of Gods ordinaunce: And ſo at the laſt he concludeth, that Pelagius and we are all one in thys point: for we teache the ſame doctrine. What moued Pelagius to teache that doctrine, I knowe not, neyther did I at any time ſo much as once thinke to holde or deſende it. And I thinke I may be bolde to ſay in the name of all that haue written or preached the doctrine that Cerberus miſliketh: that not one eyther hath or will teache it. Although Cerberus doe boaſt, that hereafter ſome parte of our doctrine ſhall be ſhewed, whereby all men may be able to iudge that we are al one with Pelagius in this point. For mine owne parte I will put all men out of doubt, that I beleue, and haue, doe, and will (if God permit) wache, that if Adam had not ſinned, he had neuer dyed. And that God did create man to be vndeſtroyed. And that God made not death as the wiſe Sapi. 2. man writeth. But by one man ſinne entred into the the worlde, and by ſinne, death. And I can not ſée that any of my breathren haue or doe teache any otherwiſe, either in writing or preaching. Wherefore Cerberus doth vs open wrong to ioyne vs with Pelagius in thys errour. As for the doctrine that I haue written, and Cerberus wreſteth top his purpoſe againſt me and my brethren: ſhall (by Gods helpe) be defended in the place where it is produced againſt vs.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               The ſeconde errour which Auſten rehearſeth, is, that Adams ſinne did onely hurt himſelfe, and not the whole generation of man. This is an other vile and deteſtable errour which Pelagius helde, that the

ſinne of Adam brought not miſerie and death vpon all his poſteritie, contrarye to the open Scripture, which ſayth, that by the ſinne of one, condemnation came vpon all men. And the holy man Eſdras Roma. 5. 4. Eſdr. 6. ſayth: O Adam, what haſt thou done? for though it was thou that ſinned, yet thou arte not fallen alone, but all we that come of thee.
               The thirde, depending alſo vpon the ſeconde, is this: That Infantes being newe borne, are in that ſtate, that Adam was in, before his tranſgreſſion, which errour ſemeth onely, or chiefly to extende to the innocencie of children. For if his minde were, that in all pointes infantes were in Adames eſtate, then ſhoulde it be ouer brutiſhe. For who ſeeth not, that babes newe borne, ſuffer of tentimes payne and griefe, which Adam did not before his tranſgreſſion. But to affirme, that Infants are not borne and conceiued in ſinne, is to denie Originall ſinne, which is an olde and a diueliſh errour, and vtterly againſt the Scripture, which ſayth plainely: Beholde, I was borne in wickedneſſe, and in ſinne hath my mother Pſalm. 51. conceyued mee.
            
            
               Crowley.
               In theſe two Articles can Cerberus finde nothing to burden vs withall. For we teache that by their firſt byrth all Infants are enheritours of that poſſeſſion that our common father Adam purchaſed by his firſt tranſgreſſion or ſinne. That is, of bodily trauaile and miſerie in this lyfe, and euerlaſting death after this lyfe. And that euen as the children of bonde ſlaues, can enioy none other thing by birth than that bondage which their parents are in: ſo the children of Adam can by nature enioy

none other thing but that which belonged to their firſt father, who by his firſt tranſgreſſion, made bath himſelfe and all his poſteritie, bonde ſlaues to death, hell, the diuell and damnation. Well therefore we ſhall not be Pelagians in this point. But if I woulde deale as ſtraightly with Cerberus, as he doth with Samuell: I coulde charge him with breaking of Priſcians heade, in the ſeconde Article, where he writeth leſeret for leſerit. Which though it be but a ſmall fault, yet is it as great a fault as that which Cerberus maketh ſo much of in Samuels rymes. And the printers were to blame for both, I am ſure. And therfore I woulde not y• eyther Samuell or Cerberus, ſhould beare any blame with them. Who ſo Iuſteth to conferre the copie of this aunſwere which was firſt caſt about in the ſtreates of Londō, with this y• is written in this Apologie: ſhall eaſely ſée that I haue amended many ſuch faultes, without noting of them to any mans reproche.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               The fourth errour is, that neither by the death & tranſgreſſiō of Adā, all the generation of mā dyeth, nor that by the Reſurrection of Chriſt, all the generation of man doth riſe againe. I doe not vnderſtande that Pelagius did here ſpeake of the laſt Refurrection at the day of iudgement, as though he had, after the maner of the Saduceis, denied the Reſurrection of our ſoules and bodies in the laſt daye, for then were all them diſputation in vaine, of the maner how we ſhoulde be ſaued, whether by the grace of God, or by the deſeruing of man, if ſaluation or Roſurrection had on either parte bene denied altogither. Neither doth the Scripture attribute the laſt

Reſurrection vnto Chriſt, as though the ſoules and bodies of men, ſhoulde haue died lyke beaſtes and not haue riſen againe vnto iudgement, if Chriſt had not come. Yea no doubt, all men ſhoulde haue riſen againe, and that to the iudgement of euerlaſting damnation, if Chriſt had not come. But I vnderſtande that Pelagius in this Article, denied the generalitie of Redemption by the death of Chriſt, by which we doe, as it were ariſe from death, bycauſe of the ſtate of lyfe and ſaluation, wherevnto we are bought in Chriſt by Redemption, lyke as we were in the ſtate of death and damnation in Adam by ſinne. Not that any man is purged from the corruption of ſinne, vnto the innocencie of Adam: but bycauſe the ſinne is couered in Chriſt, and pardoned for his ſake. And further here is to be noted, that the firſt parte of this errour, is manifeſtly, the very ſame, which is in the ſeconde and thirde errour, before reherſed, and by the ſame Scriptures plainly condemned. But to make the latter part of this errour more aparant, it was neceſſarie and thought good of Auguſtine, to rehearſe the firſt againe: that by the compariſon of condemnation in Adam, and Redemptiō in Chriſt, it might the more plainely be perceiued that Chriſt was not inferiour to Adam, nor grace inferiour to ſinne. And that, as all the generation of man is condemned in Adam: euen ſo is all the generation of man, Redemed in Chriſt. And as generall a Sauiour is Chriſt by redemption: as Adam is a condemner by tranſgreſſion. Which compariſon is taken out of S. Paule his Epiſtle to the Romanes, where he ſaith. Likewiſe then as by the ſinne of one, condemnation came vpon all men: euen ſo, by the iuſtifying of one, commeth the righteouſneſſe that Roma. 5.
                  
                  bringeth lyfe vpon all men. Yet ſhall not all men be cōdemned by Adam eternally: for there is ordained of God againe, away vnto lyfe, which way is Chriſt. Neyther ſhall all be eternallye ſaued by Chriſt: for there is of God declared a waye againe vnto death, which waye is ſinne, and the wilfull contempt of Gods mercy in Chriſt. But this appeareth to be one of Pelagius damnable errours: That Chriſt was not a generall Sauiour, that Chriſt offered not vp the ſacrifice of redemtiō for al the whole world, contrarye to the manifeſt Scripture which ſayeth. He 
                  1. Iohn. 2. 
                  it is that obtayned grace for our ſinnes, and not for our ſinnes onely, but alſo, for the ſinnes of the whole world. The ſame is alſo manifeſtly declared in theſe Scriptures folowing, and many other. Iohn. 1. a. 6. f. & 12. g. Ro. 5. d. & 14. c. 1. Cor. 8. d. 2. Cor. 5. c. Hebr. 2. c. & 2. d. 2. Pet. 2. a. And here it is worthy to be noted againe, how iuſtly this errour of Pelagius, reboundeth into the boſome of thoſe, which ſo falſely accuſe other to be giltie in the Pelagians errours. Be indifferent, dearely beloued in the Lorde, I beſeche thee, and way the matter as it is. I deſire no more.
               
            
            
               Crowley.
               When Cerberus hath framed this fourth Article of Pelagius to his purpoſe, and perſuaded himſelfe that it reboundeth into the boſomes of thoſe that accuſe him & his ſort to be giltie of Pelagius errours: he concludeth that he deſireth no more, but that his dearely beloued: whoſe letter he aunſwereth, woulde be indifferent and woulde waighe the matter as it is. Surely, if I maye doe any thing with the ſame partie, my hartie requeſt to him ſhall be, that he wyll graunt Cerberus his requeſt.

And further, I will be an humble ſuiter to all that ſhall reade this Apologie, that they ſetting all affection a ſide, will weighe both his aunſwere, and this Apologie, euen as they are, and none otherwiſe, & then haue I ynough alſo. The Article is, that all the generation of man, doth neyther die by the ſinne and tranſgreſſion of Adam, neither riſe againe by the Reſurrection of Chriſt. That is, that neither Adam was by his ſinne, a generall condemner of himſelfe and all his poſteritie: neither Chriſt by his Reſurrection, a generall reſtorer of all mankinde. For ſo doth Cerberus interprete Pelagius meaning. I will not diſpute about Pelagius meaning. For I know it coulde not be good, ſith he denyeth a truth, plainely affirmed by S. Paule and Eſdras both, as Cerberus hath truely affirmed vpon the ſeconde Article. But that S. Roma. 5. 4. Eſdr. 6. Paule ment in that place, as Cerberus doth vnderſtand him: I doe ſlatly venie. And will by Gods helpe proue, both by the Scriptures & iudgemēt of auncient writers. And that the matter I go about may be the more playne to the reader: I will firſt ſet downe in plaine wordes, what meaning Cerberus gathereth of thoſe wordes of Paule. He gathereth, that Paule ſhoulde minde to teach by thoſe wordes, that Chriſt reſtored as many, as Adam loſte. Which gathering is very falſe, and that may be proued by the verye circumſtaunce of the place it ſelfe.
               Firſt, Paules purpoſe is, by comparing Chriſt with Adam, to ſhewe that as Adam was able by diſobedience, to make himſelfe and all his poſteritie bonds ſlaues to Satan: ſo was Chriſt able by obedience, to deliuer the ſame from that bondage, and to make them the free children of God. Now for the maner of ſpeache that he vſeth in comparing theſe two togither, we muſte beware that we vnderſtande it not ſo, that we make Chriſt & Adam lyke in all pointes. For then ſhall we be enforced to

graunt many inconueniences, whereof thys is one. That as Adam loſt himſelfe by diſobedience: ſo Chriſt reſtored himſelfe by obedience. Wherof ſhoulde followe that filthy errour of them that affirme that Chriſt dyed for his owne ſinnes as well as for the ſinnes of the people, contrary to the whole courſe of the Scriptures, which teache that he was without ſpotte of ſinne, and therfore was able to ſatiſfie to God ye Father for ſinne. Another incōuenience is, yt there ſhoulde be repugnācie betwéene this place of Scripture & other, (wherin both S. Paule & our Sauiour Chriſt, doe teache, that not all mankinde, that is, not euery particular perſon of mankinde, but a certaine elected and choſen number, are by Chriſt reſtored into ye fauour of God) which thing may not be graū
                  ted. For in the Scripture there is no repugnaunce at all. And the thirde inconuenience ſhoulde be, that only originall ſinne, (that is ye ſinne that we haue of our parents, euen in our conception) is put awaye by the bloud of Chriſt, and not our actuall ſinne. So that we muſt eyther ſatiſfie for that our ſelues, or elſe periſhe, notwithſtanding Chriſtes death and ſufferance. Which is ſuch an inconuenience as cutteth of from Chriſt as many as dye not in Infancie, before they commit any actuall ſinne. Theſe inconueniences conſidered, we muſt ſéeke to finde another meaning in S. Paules wordes, when he compareth Chriſt with Adam, than that which the bare wordes ſeeme to giue. His meaning is not to make Chriſt lyke vnto Adam, but to preferre Chriſt before Adam, & to ſhewe that grace is more abundant in Chriſt, than ſinne was in Adam. Which thing appeareth in Paules very wordes in the ſame chapter, where he ſaith. Sed non ſicut delictum ita & donū. Si enim vnius delicto multi mortui ſunt: multo magis gratia Dei & donum, in gratia vnius 
                  Roma. 5. 
                  hominis Ieſu Christi, in plures abundauit. That is to ſaye,

But the gifte was not lyke vnto the ſinne, for if many dyed by ye ſinne of one: much more hath the mercy & gifte of God, in the grace of one man Ieſus Chriſt, abounded vnto many. If theſe words of Paule ſhould be vnderſtād of the number that were loſte by Adam, and reſtored by Chriſt: then muſte we graunt, ye more were reſtored by Chriſt, than loſt by Adam. For he ſaith that the grace or mercy hath abounded vnto moe. Which wordes, being vnderſtand of ye number reſtored, muſt be ſpoken in compariſon, of the many that were loſt by Adam: & ſo muſt it follow that moe were reſtored by Chriſt, than were loſt by Adam. Which can not be, vnleſſe we will ſaye that Chriſt reſtored moe than all. For Adam loſte all. The meaning of Paule is therefore, that as ye ſinne of Adam being but one man, was a ſufficient condemnation to himſelfe and all his poſteritie which are many: euen ſo, yea and much more was the grace or frée mercy, and gift of God, in Chriſt being but one, a ſufficient reſtitution of all the choſen Children of God, although ye ſame were neuer ſo many. And that this is the meaning of Paule, doth well appeare by his wordes that follow in the ſame chapter, where he ſayth. Et non ſicut per vnum qui peccauit, ita & donum. Nam condemnatio quidem ex vno, in condemnationem: gratia autem ex mult is delictis, in iustificationem. Si enim vnius delicto, mors regnauit per vnum: multo magis, abundantiam gratiae & donationis & iustitiae accipientes, in vita regnabunt, per vnum Ieſum Christum. That is to ſaye. And the gift is not ſo, as is that which entred in by one that ſinned. For the condemnation came by one ſinne, into condemnation: but grace or frée mercye, was of many ſinnes into righteouſeneſſe. For if by the ſinne of one man, death haue raigned, by the meanes of one man: much more, ſhall they which haue receiued abundance of frée mercye or grace, and of the gifte and righteouſeneſſe:

raigne in lyfe, thorow one, which is Ieſus Chriſt. Here doth Paule plainely expreſſe his meaning. Which is, that they which haue receiued abundaunce of grace, and of the gyft and righteouſneſſe, are thoſe many, that are reſtored by Chriſt Ieſu, in whome, through the ſame Chriſt, lyſe ſhall raigne. Thoſe are not the whole poſteritie of Adam. For the ſame Paule ſayth in the .xj. chapter of this Epiſtle, Quod quaerebat Iſraell non est conſecutus, electio. autē conſecuta est. Iſraell hath not obtayned ye thing that he ſought for: but the election hath obtained. Meaning that the carnall Iſraelites obtained not righteouſeneſſe, much leſſe did ye whole offſpring of Adā obtaine it. But the election, that is the elected and choſen children of God, whether they be of the ſtock of Iſrael or no, haue obtayned righteouſeneſſe through Chriſt, which is forgiueneſſe of al their ſinnes by his bloud ſheading, & righteouſneſſe, & euerlaſting lyfe by his reſurrectiō. According to ye ſaying of Paul, Traditus est propter delicta nostra, & reſurrexit propter iustificationē nostrā. He was deliuered vnto death Rom. 4. for our ſinnes: and he roſe againe for our iuſtification.
               But Cerberus and his fellowes, do vrge the vniuerſall ſigne, Omnes. All. Sicut per vnius delictum in omnes homines in condemnationem: ſic & per vnius iustitiam in omnes homines, in iustificationem vitae. That is. Euen as by one mans fault, ſinne entred into all men, to condemnation, ſo by the righteouſeneſſe of one man, is righteouſeneſſe entred into all men, to the iuſtification of lyfe. This vniuerſall ſigne muſte néedes ſtreatche it ſelfe to all Adams poſteritie, and therfore all muſte be made righteouſe by Chriſt. Theſe men will not ſee how ſuche vniuerſall ſignes are vſed in the Scriptures. They can not perceiue how this vniuerſall ſigne ſhoulde in the firſt ſentence ſtreatche it ſelfe to all the generation of the firſte Adam that ſinned, and in the ſeconde ſentence to all the

generation of the ſeconde Adam, which is Chriſt. The generation of ye firſt are all that haue or ſhall be borne of fleſhe and bloud, and the generation of the ſeconde, are al they that be borne of God. If we ſhoulde in all places of Scripture, ſtreatche this vniuerſall ſigne all, ſo farre as Cerberus doth ſtreatche it here: we ſhould make as good a piece of worke as ye Nonne did, which reade in ſ. Paule Omnia probate, proue all things. And therefore hauing a 1. Theſs. 5. minde to ſir Iohn, the Chaplen of the houſe, ſhe proued what it was to lye with a man. And being with childe, the matter came to the knowledge of the Abbas: ſhe excuſed hir ſelfe by Saint Paule, who biddeth vs proue all things. If a théefe that taketh another mans goodes, ſhoulde excuſe himſelfe with Omnia mihi licent, I may doe 1. Corin. 3. 1. Corin. 6. all things, or Omnia vestra ſunt. All things are yours: It would not be founde that theſe vniuerſall ſignes ſhould either make it léeful for him to take another mans goods, or to haue right to that that is not hys by ſome iuſt title. I woulde wiſhe Cerberus and his fellowes therfore, to weigh this matter better before they triumph ouer vs in ſuch ſort as he doth in this his aunſwere. And I woulde wiſhe him to conſider well whether ſaint Auſten in the Epiſtle where theſe Articles of Pelagius be written, do not write cleane contrary to this iudgement of his. For in the very place that he citeth to make for his purpoſe, S. Auſten ſayth thus. Infantes nuper nati, non ſunt in illo statu in quo Adam fuit ante praeuaricationem, vt ad ipſos pertineat quod breuiter ait Apostolus. Per vnum hominem mors, & 
                  1. Corin. 15. 
                  per vnum hominem reſurrectio mortuorum. Sicut enim in Adam omnes moriuntur: it a & in Christo omnes viuiſicabuntur. Vnde ſit, quod Infantes nō baptizati, non ſolum regnum coelorum, verum etiam vitam aeternam habere non poſsint. That is, Infantes that be lately borne, are not in that ſtate that Adam was before he ſinned, that that thing which the Apoſtle doth

in fewe wordes affirme, might partaine vnto them. By one man came death, and by one man came the reſurrection of the deade. For euen as in Adam all dye: ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alyne. Wherby it commeth to paſſe that Inſants which are not baptiſed, are not onely vnable to enioye the Kingdome of Heauen, but alſo lyfe euerlaſting. Theſe wordes me think, are very plaine againſt that which Cerberus would maintaine by Paule and Auſten. For if Infants vnbaptiſed can not haue the kingdome of God nor euerlaſting lyfe: how doth this ſaying In christo omnes viuificabuntur: All ſhalbe quickned in Chriſt: pertayne to all the poſteritie of Adam? vnleſſe he will ſay, that Infantes that dye before baptiſme be not of Adams poſteritie? Better matter can I not wiſhe for againſt Cerberus, than that which hangeth to the foundation that he himſelfe buildeth vpon. It were for my purpoſe to aduaūce the auctoritie of this Epiſtle, bicauſe it helpeth me very much againſt this Hel Dogge Cerberus: but bicauſe I woulde not haue the Reader to conceyue ſuch an opinion of S. Auſten, as to thinke that he ſhoulde be of ſuch minde as the Auctour of thys Epiſtle doth ſhewe himſelfe to be in certaine pointes: I will cite the iudgement of Eraſmus concerning thys Epiſtle & all other of this title. That is, Ad Bonifacium. To Boniface. Speaking of ye Booke of Epiſtles, wher, in this Epiſtle. 106. is written, he ſaith. Nonnullae ſimplicitor confictae, quod genus ſunt illae Bonefacij ad Augustinum, Augustini ad Bonifacium. Some of thoſe Epiſtles (ſaith he) are altogether fayned. As are thoſe of Bonifacius to Auguſtine, and of Auſten to Boniface. Now iudge gentle Reader what this Cerberus meaneth, that leauing the good and ſounde workes of Auſten, where he writeth very well of this matter: ſetteth his foundation vpon ſuch rotten patches as ſome ſuch as he is, haue put forth

in Auſtens name. No maruell though Cerberus be aſhamed to ſet his name to his booke. This might ſuffiſe for our defence againſt Cerberus his aſſaulte in thys point. But I will adde one Scripture or two, and ſo the iudgement of ſome learned writers, that he take not occaſion of a new calumniatiō, becauſe I promiſed more than I haue yet performed. Saint Paule writing to Timothe in his ſeconde Epiſtle and ſeconde chapter, ſayth 2. Timo. 2. thus. Sed firmum fundamentum Dei ſtat, habens ſignaculu hoc. Cognouit Dominus qui ſunt ſui. The foundation of God, ſtandeth firme and ſure, hauing this ſure ſeale. The Lorde knoweth who be his. By which wordes it is manifeſt, that S. Paule vnderſtoode not that all mankinde were elected in Chriſt, and ſo reſtored by Chriſt: but a certaine number, which though they be vnknowne vnto men, yet doth the Lorde (whoſe they be) knowe them well, and will not ſuffer them, no nor any of them, to periſhe. Wherfore he exhorteth all ſuch as call vpon the name of the Lorde (that is all Chriſtians) to depart from iniquitie. For in a great houſe (ſaith he) there be, not only veſſelles of Golde and Siluer, but alſo of Timber and Earth: ſome to ſerue for honorable vſes, and ſome for vile vſes. I knowe how ſome doe wreſt theſe latter wordes of S. Paule, to proue that it is in mans power to depart from iniquitie, bicauſe Saint Paule doth will Chriſtians ſo to doe. And eſpecially thoſe wordes which followe, which are theſe. Si quis ergo, emund. iuerit ſe ab istis, erit vas in honorem ſanctificatum, & vtile domino, ad omne opus bonum paratum. If any man therfore, ſhall clenſe himſelfe from theſe men: he ſhall be a veſſell ſanctified vnto honour, and profitable for the Lord, being prepared and made readie for euery good worke. Theſe wordes do manifeſtly declare, ſay they, that it is in mannes power to clenſe himſelfe, and to make himſelfe a veſſel méete for

the Lordes vſe and ſeruice. Theſe men will not vnderſtande that commaundements, admonitions, exhortations, and councelles be to any purpoſe: except thoſe to whome they be giuen, be able to do the things, that they be commaunded, admoniſhed, exhorted, or councelled to doe. And ſo ſhall the commaundements of God be to no purpoſe. For who hath bene, is, or ſhall be able, to doe that God commaundeth, when he ſayth. Thou ſhalte loue the Lorde thy God, with all thine heart, with al thy ſoule, and with all thy minde. And thy neighbour as thy ſelfe? Doth not S. Paule ſay that we are not able of our 2. Corin. 3. ſelues, ſo much as to think a good thought. And is not this according to yt which Chriſt himſelfe teacheth when Iohn. 15. he ſaith to his Diſciples: without me ye can do nothing? But theſe men will not vnderſtande that the vſe of theſe things is, to cauſe the choſen children of God, to acknowledge their owne inhabilitie, and humblye to begge at Gods hande his helpe that therby they may doe yt which is commaunded or taught: and that the reprobate
                     •
                   may be without excuſe, yea or pretence of excuſe. Saint Auſten, whome Cerberus woulde faine haue to take hys parte, doth vnderſtande this place of Paule, cleane contrary to Cerberus his purpoſe: As appereth in moe places then one of his beſt writings. Namely in the. viz. chapter of the .xx. booke De Ciuitate Dei, that is of the Citie of God, (which is, the Church of Chriſt) where ſpeaking of that Church called from among all the nations of the worlde: he ſaith thus. Has enim elegit Deus ante mundi constitutionem eruere depotestate tenebrarum, & transferre in regnū ſilij claritatis ſuae, ſicut Apostolus ait. Nam ſeducere illum gentes De Ciuitate Dei. lib. 20. Cap. 7. etiam nunc, & ſecum trabere in aeternam po
                        •
                     nam, ſed non praedestinatas in aeternam vitam, quis ſidelis ignorat? Nec moueat, quod ſoepe Diabolus ſeducit etiā illos, quiiā regenerati in Christo, vias ingrediuntur Dei. Nouit enim Dominus qui ſunt eius, ex hijs

in aeternam damnationem, neminem ille ſeducit. Sic enim nouit eos Dominus, vt Deus, quem nihil latet, etiam futurorum, non vt homo, qui hommem ad praeſens videt, ſic tamen videt, cuius cor non videt, qualis autem postea ſit futurus, nec ſeipſum videt. Ad hoc ergo ligatus est Diabolus, & incluſus in abyſso, vt iam non ſeducat gentes, ex quibus constat Eccleſia, quas antea ſeductas tenebat antequam eſsit Eccleſia. Nec enim dictum est, vt non ſeduceret aliquem: ſed vt non ſeduceret, inquit, iam gentes, in quibus Eccleſiam proculdubio voluit intelligi. That is to ſay. God did before the beginning of the Worlde, chooſe theſe nations, that he might deliuer them out of ye power of darkneſſe, and tranſlate them into the kingdome of the ſonne of his owne brightneſſe, as the Apoſtle ſayth. For what faythfull man knoweth not, that the Deuill doth euen now, ſeduce nations, and draw them with himſelfe into euerlaſting paine: but not thoſe nations which are predeſtinated into euerlaſting lyfe? Neither let it trouble anye man, that the Deuill doth oftentimes ſeduce euen thoſe, that being alredy regenerated in Chriſt, do walke in the wayes of God. For the Lorde knoweth who be hys: of them doth the Deuill ſeduce none, to euerlaſting damnation. For the Lorde doth knowe them, as God knoweth, from whom nothing is hidde, no not of the things to come. Not as a man knoweth, who doth for the preſent time ſee a man, but yet ſo, as whoſe heart he ſéeth not, yea, he ſéeth not himſelfe ſo, that he can tell what maner a man he himſelfe ſhalbe hereafter. To this purpoſe therfore, is the Deuill bounde, and ſhut vp in darkneſſe: that he doe not now ſeduce the nations of whome the Churche doth conſiſt. Which nations he did before holde ſtill in errour, before the Church was. For it is not ſayde, that he ſhoulde not ſeduce any man: but that he ſhould not now ſeduce (ſayth he) ye nations, in which nations, no doubt he woulde haue the Church to be vnderſtande.
               
                  
This Booke was Auſtens owne without all doubt, and therefore, we maye be bolde to affirmo that this is Auſtens minde, not only vpon this place of Scripture, but alſo vpon this matter, that is, that not all mankind, but a certaine choſen ſort, are reſtored againe by Chriſt. And that none of thoſe that are ſo reſtored, can periſhe, although God doe ſometime ſuffer them to fall.
               Againe, the ſame Auſten writing againſt the Donatiſts, 
                  Auguſt. li. 5. de. bapt. capit. 27. in his fift booke De Baptiſmo, that is of Baptiſme, ſaith thus, in the .xxvij. chapter of the ſame Booke. Numerus ergo ille iustorum, qui ſecundum propoſitum vocati ſunt, de quibus dictum est, Nouit dominus qui ſunt eius: ipſe est ortus concluſus, fons ſignatus, puteus aquae viuae, paradiſus cum fructu pomorum.

That number therfore, of the righteous, which are called according to Gods purpoſe, concerning which it is ſayde, that the Lord knoweth who they be that be his: is the ſame that is the fenſed garden, the ſealed fountaine, the pyt of ſpringing water, and the paradiſefull of the fruite of Apples. Of this number there be ſome that lyue ſpiritually, & walke in the excellent waye of charitie. And when they doe in the ſpirite of leuitie, inſtruct a man that is ouertaken wt any fault: they doe take good héede leaſt they themſelues be tempted alſo. And when it happeneth ye any of them be ouertaken: the affection of loue is ſomething repreſſed in them, but it is not vtterly quenched. And when

it riſeth againe, and waxeth feruent: it is reſtored againe to his olde courſe or raſe. For theſe men can ſaye. My ſoule did

               And againe in the ſame chapter, Saint Auſten ſaith thus. Sunt etiam quidam ex eo numero, qui adhuc nequiter viuant, aut etiam in haereſibus, vel in gentilium ſuperstitionibus iaceant: & tamen etiam illic nouit dominus qui ſunt eius. Nam
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      in illi ineffabili praeſcientia Dei: multi qui foris videntur, intus ſunt, & multi qui intus videntur, fores ſunt. Ex illis ergo omnibus, qui, vt ita dicam, intrinſecus & in occulto intus ſunt: conſtat ille hortus cōcluſus, fons ſignatus, puteus aquae viuae, paradiſus cum fructu pomorum. That is. There be alſo ſome of that number, which doe yet liue wickedly, either doe lye in Hereſies or in ye ſuperſtitiōs of the Heathen: and yet the Lorde doth euen there knowe, who be his. For in that vnſpeakeable foreknowledge of God: many that ſéeme to be without, are within, & many that ſeme to be within, are without. That incloſed garden therefore, that ſealed fountaine, that pyt of ſpringing water, and that paradiſe of the fruite of Apples: doth conſiſt of all thoſe, that be inwardely & ſecretely within, if I may ſo ſpeake.
               And againe the ſame Auſten ſaith in the .xlv. treatiſe vpon Iohn. Et oues vocem eius audiunt, & proprias oues vocat 
                  August. Tract. 45. in Iohn. 
                  nominatim. Habet enim nomina eorum ſcripta in libro vitae. Proprias oues vocat nominatim: hinc dicit Apostolus. Nouit Dominus qui ſunt eius. That is. And his ſhéepe heare his voice, and he calleth his owne ſhéepe by name. For he hath their names written in the Booke of Lyfe. He calleth his owne ſheepe by name. Hereof commeth it that the Apoſtle ſayth. The Lorde knoweeh who they be that he hys.
               What ſhoulde I cite any moe places of this Auctour for this purpoſe? If theſe will not ſatiſfie Cerberus:
                  
let him barke ſtill tyll his throte be horſe. I knowe theſe may ſatiſfie all that be not wilfully blinde. For in three ſeuerall places, S. Auſten hath cited theſe wordes of S. Paule. (The Lorde knoweth who be his) euen in the ſame ſence that I haue done.
               One other Scripture I will cite alſo, which is written in the .xvij. of S. Iohns Goſpell. The wordes were ſpoken by our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, in that Prayer that he made to his Father the night before he ſuffered, and they are theſe Non pro mundorogo, ſed probus quos ded
                        •
                     sti mihi, quia tui ſunt. I doe not praye for the worlde (ſayth Chriſt, but for thoſe that thou haſt giuen vnto mée, bicauſe they be thine. And that Cerberus may know what is ment here by the worde Worlde: he ſhall ſée what S. Auſten writeth in his. 107. treatiſe vpon Iohn, concerning August. tractat. 107. ſuper Ioh. this text. Mundum vidt modo intelligi, qui viuunt ſecundum concupiſcontiam mundi, & non ſunt in ea ſorte gratiae, vt ab illo eligantur ex mundo: non vti

                        •
                     , ſubiungit. Quia tui ſunt. That is. He would now haue vs vnderſtande, that thoſe men be the worlde which doe liue according to concupiſcence or luſte of the worlde, and are not in that ſtate of grace that they might be by him choſen out of the worlde: He doth not therfore ſay that he doth pray for the world, but for them that his father gaue vnto him. For by that, that his father hath already giuen them vnto him, it commeth to paſſe, that they pertaine not vnto that worlde, that he prayeth not for. And after this he addeth. Bicauſe they be thine. If Cerberus were not to obſtinately blinde, he coulde not but ſee and confeſſe, that S. Auſten is full againſt him. For what other cauſe doth ſ. Auſten alleadge, why thoſe that Chriſt prayde for, were not of the worlde, but onely,

that the Father had giuen them vnto him? And what cauſe doth he alleadge why Chriſt might not chooſe them out of the worlde that he prayed not for: but onely that they were not in that ſtate of grace or mercye, that they might be choſen out of the worlde? And the text it ſelfe, might perſuade any man but Cerberus and his felowes, that there is a number that be not reſtored by Chriſt. For woulde Chriſt denie to praye for any of them y• are reſtored by him? I trowe not.
               But to bring Cerberus from Hell gate, if it will be: I will cyte yet one place of S. Auſten, wherein he ſpeaketh as plainely as any man can deuiſe to ſpeake, concerning this matter. In his firſt booke that he writeth of the deſeruings, and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and of y• baptiſme of Infants, we reade thus in the .xv. chapter.

               After S. Auſten had ſayde, that it is not the only imitation of Chriſt, that can make a man righteous, but the frée mercy which doth regenerate by the ſpirite, ſo is it not the imitation of Adam only that maketh vs ſinners, but the puniſhement which engendreth by the fleſhe: he addeth the wordes aboue in Latine, which are in Engliſhe thus. For this cauſe alſo, is it ſaid, all, and all: for

not the ſame all y• are begotten by Adam, are by Chriſt regenerated. But this is well ſayde, that euen as the carnall generation of no man, is otherwiſe than by Adā: ſo is the ſpirituall generation of no man otherwiſe than by Chriſt. For if there might be ſome men begotten in the fleſhe, and not by Adam, and ſome men regenerated in the ſpirite, & not by Chriſt: we might not ſay plainely all, either in the one place or in the other. And afterwarde, he doth ſaye, that the ſame all, are many: for 
                     〈◊〉
                   ſome certaine thing, thoſe which are but fewe, may be all. But the carnall generation hath many, and the ſpirituall hath many alſo: although this ſpiritual haue not ſo many, as hath that carnall. But yet for all that, euen as that hath all men: ſo hath this all iuſte men. For as without that, no man is a man: euen ſo without this no man is a 
                     〈…〉
                  ſt man, and in eche of theſe are many.
               Now let Cerberus and his fellowes, bark at Auſten. For he hath made the ſame interpretation of S. Paules wordes, that I haue made before. Whereby it is manifeſt, that that Epiſtle that Cerberus buildeth vpon, is not Auſtens owne, but fained by ſome ſuch as Cerberus is, and put forth in Auſtens name.
               But bycauſe I promiſed before to proue mine affirmation as well by the iudgement of Auncient writers, as by Scripture: I will adde the iudgement of one or two moe, whoſe autoritie and antiquitie is not to be diſpiſed. Of the which Ambroſe ſhall be one. Writing vpon the Epiſtle to the Romans, he ſayth. Sicut per vnius delictum in omnes homines in condemnationem: ſic & per vnius iuſtitiam 
                  Roma. 5. 
                  in omnes homines, in iustificationem vitae. Hoc est, ſicut per vnius delictum, omnes condemnationem meruerunt, ſimiliter peccantes: ita & in iustitia vnius, omnes iustificabuntur credentes. Si qui autem condemnationem hanc, generalem eſse putant: ſimili modo & iustificationem generalem accipient. Sed non est

verum, quia non omnes credunt. Sicut enim per inobedientiam vnius hominis, peccatores constituti ſunt plurimi: ita et per vnius obedientiam iusti constituentur multi. Quos ſupra omnes dixit: hic plures & multos ſignificat. Plures enim delictum Adae ſecuti ſunt praeuaricando, non omnes, & multi iusti constituentur, non omnes. Non ergo in eos regnauit mors, qui non peccauerunt in ſimilitudine preuaricationis Adae. That is to ſay. Euen as by one mans ſinne, giltineſſe came vpon all men to condemnation: ſo did iuſtification of lyfe come vpon all mē through the righteouſeneſſe of one man. That is, euen as by the ſinne of one man, all men that doe ſinne as he dyd, haue deſerued condemnation: euen ſo all that do beleue, ſhall be iuſtified in the righteouſeneſſe of one man. And if any doe think that this condemnation is general: let them in lyke maner take the iuſtification to be generall. But that is not true, bycauſe all men doe not beleue. For euen as by the diſobedience of one man, many were made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one man, many ſhall be made righteous. The Apoſtle doth here call thoſe ſame, many, that he did before call, all. For many haue in ſinning folowed the ſinne of Adam, but not all: and many ſhall be made righteous, but not all. Death therefore hath not raigned ouer them, which haue not ſinned in lyke ſort as Adam did. Theſe be the wordes of Ambroſe. Which though at the firſt ſight, they ſéeme to incline to the errour of Pelagius: yet when they be well weighed, they giue a good and ſounde meaning. That is, that ſinne neuer raigned in any of Gods elect. For although the elect of God, in as much as they be the childrē of Adam, be partakers of Adams ſinne, and in Adam condemned: yet are they by Chriſte deliuered from that condemnation, ſo that ſinne hath in them no dominion at all: Which thing appeareth in them by the fayth in Chriſt, which when they come to knowledge, they doe

both by wordes and workes declare. That this is the meaning of Ambros, doth very plainely appeare, by that he ſayth, that all the beleuers ſhall be iuſtified. For what nedeth iuſtification, where no condemnatiō was? Thus much I thought good to write concerning y• ſimple meaning, of this auncient Father, leaſt any mā of ſimplicity miſtaking his meaning, might think yt he ſhould denie ye Elect to be conceyued and borne in originall ſinne, from which neuer any that was borne (Chriſt only excepted) coulde be frée. But this is his meaning, that in the Elect and choſen Children of God, this ſinne hath no dominion, as it doth appeare by their obedience that they ſhewe in beleuing the Goſpell: but in the Reprobates, it beareth rule ſtill: For Chriſt hath not killed it in them.
               And to make an ende of this matter: Saint Paule ſayth thus in his eyght chapter to the Romans. Who ſhall laye any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that doth iuſtifie, who is it that ſhall condemne? If all mankinde, then, be elected in Chriſt (as Cerberus ſayth) then ſhall no ſinne be layde to any mans charge. For who dare accuſe Gods choſen children? And ſo ſhall Cerberus doctrine be the deſtruction of all vertue, as he hath afore affirmed of the doctrine we teache of Predeſtination.
               As for that which Cerberus citeth out of the ſeconde chapter of S. Iohns firſt Epiſtle, & the other places that he ſendeth the Reader vnto: I doe nowe paſſe ouer, as ſufficiently aunſwered, by that I haue written concerning S. Paules meaning in the fift to the Romans.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               The fift of Pelagius errours was, that riche men being baptized, except they did vtterly renounce and forſake their riches, though they ſeeme to doe ſome

good, yet is it not accepted, neither can they haue the Kingdome of God. A filthy, and an abhominable errour, directly repugnant, both to the ſtate of the common wealth, and alſo to the worde of God, which ſayth. Charge them that be riche in this 1. Timoth. 6. world, that they be not exceding wyſe &c. And that they doe good and be riche in good workes. &c.
               The ſixt errour is, that the grace of God and the helpe of God, is not giuē to euery one of our works, but that it is in free choyſe, in the lawe, and in doctrine This errour is exceding wicked and execrable, that mā by the law, by doctrine, and by free choiſe, is able to doe any maner of good worke, whatſoeuer it be, without the grace and helpe of God. For as S. Paule ſayeth; we are not ſufficient of our ſelues, to 2. Corinth. 3. think any thing, as of our ſelues: but our ableneſſe cōmeth of God. And againe. It is God that worketh Phillip. 2. in vs, both the will and the dede, euen of good will.
               The ſeuenth errour is, that the grace of God is giuen according to our deſeruing. Vile and abhominable is this errour alſo, and contrary to the manifeſt minde and words of the Apoſtle, which ſayth. If it be of workes, then is it no more grace, for then Roma. 11. were deſeruing, no more deſeruing.
               The eyght errour is, that none can be called the children of God, except they be all together made without ſinne. This errour is lyke wicked with the reſt, directly repugnant to the open Scripture, where it is written. If we ſay we haue no ſinne, we deceiue our ſelues, and the truth is not in vs. For as S. Iames 1. Iohn. 1. Iacob. 3. ſaith of himſelfe and of all other. In many things we ſinne all.
            
            
               Crowley.
               
                  
In theſe foure errours, Cerberus can finde nothing to charge vs with all: and therfore he goeth about to get himſelfe credite among the ſimple Chriſtians, by calling theſe errours, filthy, and abhominable, exceding wicked and execrable, vile and abhominable, and lyke wycked with the reſte. But if a man might come to reaſon with Cerberus: I thinke it woulde fall out in the ende, that he is not ſo cleare of the ſixt errour as he would ſéeme to be, when he calleth it exceeding wicked and execrable. For if he were aſked: why feared he to tranſlate Saint Paules words, according to his meaning, when he ſaide to the Philippians. Deus est qui operatur in vobis & velle & perſwere, pro bona voluntate. That is. It is God, that worketh Phillip. 2. in you, both the will and the performance therof, according to his good will or pleaſure. Cerberus can not away with Gods good will. And therefore he tranſlateth S. Paules wordes, euen of good will. He feareth, by like, that ſome man woulde conclude, yt it is Gods good will, that by ſuch malicious doings, as his is, in ſtrowing of his ſtaunderous writings: ſome of them that be ſlaundered therby, ſhoulde take occaſion to open hys ſubtiltie, both in the deteſting of theſe errours, and alſo in the cyting of Scriptures to the contrary of that which is affyrmed in them. Which is nothing elſe, but to blinde the eyes of the ſimple. But ſuch as haue had to doe with ſuch as he is, do knowe, that as he ſaith here, that man is not ſufficient of himſelfe to thinke any thing, ſo he thinketh, and wyl ſay if he be vrged; that man hath power of himſelfe to withſtande the good motions of Gods holy ſpirit, ſo that God can not drawe ſuch as he will, but only ſuch as he findeth willing to be drawne. And to auoide the errour of giuing of grace according to merites or deſeruing, he ſayth that it is giuen to all mankinde indifferently. Let all men therſore, beware of his ſubtiltie: for

he mindeth to diſceiue.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               The ninth errour is, that there is no free choyſe, if a man haue neede of Gods helpe, ſeing it is in a mans owne will to doe a thing, or not to doe it. This was alſo the wicked opinion of Pelagius: that if it be graunted, that a mā hath neede of Gods helpe: then muſte it needes followe (ſaith Pelagius) that he hath no choiſe in doing of things, but whatſouer a man doth, that muſt he nedes, and cannot chooſe but do. This is the Deuils only way, aboue all other to leade men to diſtruction, not to ſuffer them to walke in the playne path of the Lorde, but to turne them to ſome extremitie, either on the left hande, or elſe on the right, either into the blinde path of crooked ſuperſtition, or into the wyde way of leude libertie, either to ſeeke iuſtification by deſeruing of workes, or by an only fayth, not mightie in loue by operation. Such lyke extremitie doth the Deuill vſe in this point of Doctrine, either driuing men into the doubting dreames of deſtenie, or into the abſolute freewill of Papiſtrie. Either affyrming all things ſo to be ordeyned of God, that whatſoeuer a mā doth, be it good or euill: he muſte needes, and can not chooſe, but of meere neceſſitie, by the ordinaunce of God, commit the ſame. Or elſe affirming, that man by freewill, or naturall ſtrength, can do the wil of God, and walke in his lawe without the continuall helpe and grace of God. Which two extremities, Auſten doth very plainly condemne, in theſe words folowing.

               We doe (ſayth he) ſo confeſſe free choiſe, that we ſaye a man hath alwaye neede of the helpe of God. And that as well they erre, which ſaye with Manicheus, that a man can not eſchewe ſinne, as alſo they which ſaye with Iouinian, that a man can not commit ſinne. Thus ſayth Auguſtine
               To conclude therefore, this is numbred among the wicked errours of Pelagius, that if a man haue free choiſe, then hath he no neede of the grace or helpe of God, contrarye to the manifeſt and open Scripture, which ſayth by the mouth of S. Paule. I can doe all things, through the helpe of Chriſt, which Phillip. 4. 4. Eſdr. 9. ſtrengthneth mee. And Eſdras ſaith They that haue abhorred my lawe, whilſt they had yet freedome and open roume of amendement, and conuerſion, and vnderſtoode not but diſpiſed it: the ſame muſt knowe it after death, in paine.
               And here, yet once againe, I deſire thee to marke who they are, which with Pelagius fall into this extremitie to affirme, that if a man haue choiſe, then hath he no nede of Gods helpe: or if he haue nede of Gods helpe, then hath he no choiſe at all. And who they are, which on the other ſide, with Auſtē againſt Pelagius, do affirme and cōfeſſe: that man ſo hath fredom or choiſe, that neuertheleſſe, he hath cōtinually, nede of the helpe & grace of God Who they are, I ſay, which in this point alſo, ought worthily to be called Pelagians, let all men iudge. The caſe is ſo clere, that no lack of knowledge, but onely wilfull blindeneſſe,

may helpe to cloke the matter. I will therfore paſſe forwarde.
            
            
               Crowley.
               Nowe Cerberus thinketh he hath wonne the fielde. This caſe is ſo plaine (ſayth he) that no lacke of knowledge may helpe to cloke it, but wilfull blindeneſſe. And what is the caſe. Forſoth that he and hys fellowes be cleared of Pelagian hereſie: and I and my fellowes proued to be of one minde with Pelagius, who ſayde that if a man haue choyſe, he needeth not Gods helpe: or if he néede it, he hath no choiſe at all. And where hath Cerberus founde that Pelagius ſayde ſo? Not in the ninth Article, written in the 106. Epiſtle (for there he ſayth but thus: If our will or choiſe, haue néede of the help of God it is not free: for by frée choyſe, euery man hath in hys owne will, either to doe any thing, or to leaue it vndone) but he findeth it in the. 191. Sermon De tempore, that is, of the time. Not as the wordes or opinion of Pelagius, but as the wordes of Manichaeus. Here is pretie packing. To make blinde men beleue, that there is no difference betwixte Pelagius opinion in his ninth Article, and vs that now write and preache of the eternall predeſtinatiō of God: Cerberus bringeth out one of the opinions of Manichaeus, and ſaith, that foraſmuch as we agrée with him in that point, and he and his fellowes doe not, therfore, we be Pelagians, and he and his companie are enimies to Pelagius and vs to. But as Cerberus hath requeſted his friende, whome he aunſwereth: euen ſo muſt I deſire thée (gentle Reader) yet once againe to marke how Cerberus handleth his matter, that he may ſéeme to purge himſelfe and to charge mée and other with Pelagian hereſie.
               
                  
I will not deale with Cerberus, as he hath done with Samuel: for if I would, I might ſay that he had ſhamefully belyed S. Auſten, when he citeth his wordes out of his. 192. Sermon De verbis. Apostoli, y• is, vpon the words of the Apoſtle, whereas ſaint Auſten writeth but. 35. ſermons of that

                  . But as I haue promyſed before, I will aſcribe all ſuch things to the negligence of the Printer, although therbe iuſt cauſe to aſcribe this in Cerberus him ſelfe. For it appeareth by the copie that came to my handes, that he had read it ouer after it was imprinted, and before it was ſtrowed in 
                     ••
                  e ſtroates: for he hath emended ſome faultes wyth his pen, but this fault remaineth vntouched. Wherefore it ſéemeth that he toke it for no fault at al. Wherof I gather that he neuer read the place in S. Auſten him ſelfe, but had it in ſome of the patrons of Pelagius errour, and had no leyſure to ſéeke it in S. Auſtens workes, and therefore miſtoke both the title and number. Which if Cerberus might fynde in 
                     •
                  e, ſhould be a matter of ſome thing.
               Well, to the purpoſe. Cerberus hath belyed both Pelagius and vs. For he ſaith that we affirme, that if man haue choyſe, then hath he no neede of Gods helpe, or if he haue néede of Gods helpe, then hath he no choyſe at all. Let vs ſée the words that are written in the Epiſtle. 106. euen as ſaint Auſten (if that Epiſtle be his) wrate them in Latin. Et non eſse. li

                     e. Nowe let vs ſée howe: Cerberus him ſelfe doth engliſh this Latin. The ninth errour (ſayth he) is, that there is no frée choyſe, if a man haue néede of Gods help, ſéeing it is in a mans owne wil to do a thing, or not to do it. Now how agréeth this with y• which he chargeth

                  Pelagius withall? Hath Pelagius ſayde that man hath no choyſe at all? Or can man haue no choyſe at all, vnleſſe the ſame be frée to do what it luſteth? I thinke all men do ſée that he chargeth Pelagius wyth more than euer he ſpake or wrote in this poynt. And as touching the former part of his Article, which being truly tranſlated, are thus much. And y• choyſe is not frée, if it haue néede of Gods helpe. Who is able to ſpeake againſt this? Underſtāding Liberum, or Frée, to ſignifie that which is not vnder the power of any other. And I trowe ſaint Auſten wyll ſay no leſſe in the. 13. ſermon that he wrate De verbis Apostoli, of the wordes of the Apoſtle. Thus ſayth ſaint Auſten. Cum dico tibi, ſine adiutorio Dei nihil agis, nihil boni dico. Nam ad mala agendum, habes ſine adiutorio Dei, liberam voluntatem, quanquam non est illa libera: A quo enim quis deuictus est, huic & ſeruus addictus est. Et omnis qui facit peccatum, ſeruus est peccati. Et ſi vos filius liberauerit, tunc veri liberi eritis. That is to ſay. When I ſay vnto thée, that thou doſt nothing without the help of God: I meane, no good thing. For thou haſt a frée will to doe euill without the helpe of God, although the ſame be not frée. For looke of whom a man is ouercome, to y• ſame is he made a ſlaue, and euery one that doth commit ſinne, is become the ſeruant of ſinne. And if the ſonne ſhall make you frée, then ſhall ye be frée in deede.
               Nowe if Cerberus will conclude that Pelagius denieth that man hath any choyſe, bicauſe he ſayth, it is not frée, if it haue néede of Gods helpe: then let him ſo conclude vpon ſaint Auſtens wordes in this place. For he ſayth that mans wil is not frée, no not in doing euil. For it is ſubiect vnto ſinne, and can not but obey that tyrant. And ſhall we thinke then that ſaint Auſten woulde ſaye that it is frée in doing good? I thinke not. For he hath ſayd that in that which is good, we can do nothing without

Gods helpe.
               But leaſt Cerberus ſhoulde take a newe occaſion to calūniate, bicauſe ſaint Auſten doth often tymes graunt that he denieth not the fréedome of mans will, and ſo ſet Auſten agaynſt Auſten: I will in fewe wordes ſhewe howe both ſaint: Auſten and we, do vnderſtande mans will, both to be frée, and not frée.
               As mans will is not regenerated, ſo is it frée from y• ſpirit, and bonde to that corruption that entred into all mankinde by the ſynne of the firſt man, which corruption ſaint Paule calleth the lawe of the members, the wiſedome of the fleſh, the olde man and the fleſh, ſo that it cannot once liſte vp it ſelfe to any thing that is not agréeyng to that corruption.
               Contrariwyſe, man that is regenerate, ſo farre as he is regenerate, hath his will, fréed, and ſet at libertie, frō that corruption, ſo that it cannot leade him further than the ſpirite of God will ſuffer him to goe; for he is nowe freed from corruption or ſinne, and made the 
                     ••
                  ndman of of y• ſpirite, ſo that he hath now in that regenerated parte, no delite in anie other thing than the lawe of God. Yea he cannot haue anie delite in ſinne. But as ſainte Paule ſayth. As touching my inwarde man, I haue a delyte in Rom. 7. Rom. 8. the lawe of God. And agayne. Such as are ledde by the ſpirite of God, are the children of God. They are therefore called ſpirituall, and newe creatures.
               Agayne, as man is a reſonable creature, ſo is his will called, Arbitrium, that is, Choyſo, and bycauſe the ſame cannot be enforced by any humane or mans power, it is called Liberum, that is, Frée. And ſo is it Liberum Arbitrium, Frée Choiſe. For though man haue power ouer mā to reſtaine y• actiōs of his will, yet hath he not power to reſtayne the will it ſelfe. As for example. Simion, being impriſoned in Egypte, had a will to be with his Geneſ. 42.
                  
Father and brethren in the land of Canaan, not withſtanding that his body was kept in priſon and reſtrained of libertie to execute his will. For Ioſeph had no power vpon the wil to turne it, or reſtraine it. But Simion had, yea, he coulde not but haue his will at libertie, notwithſtanding any thing that Ioſeph eyther dyd or coulde deuiſe to doe. For to turne or ſtaye the will of man, is the worke of God only. And therfore S. Paule ſayth. I haue planted, & Apollo hath watred, but God gaue y• increaſe. 1. Corinth. 3. And S. Auſten ſayth. Qui plantat, & qui rigat, for inſeeus operatur: qui vero dat incrementū, intrinſecus opitulatur. He that De verbis Apoſt. Ser. 4. plāteth, and he that watereth, do worke outwardly: but he that giueth increaſe, doth help or ſuccour withinforth. And this is not done by any bodyly force, but by that inward drawing that Chriſt ſpeaketh of whē he ſayth. No man commeth vnto me, excepte my Father drawe him. Iohn. 6. This drawing is not a forcible drawing: but a working of the power of God, whereby the will that ſtroue agaynſt, is made ready to follow the drawer. An example wherof we haue in Paule. Who willing to goe to Act. 9. Damaſco to perſecute Chriſtians, is vpō a ſodaine made willing to preach Chriſt. This was not wrought by the ſtriking him downe to the grounde (for then ſhoulde the lyke haue bene wrought in the Iewes that came to take Chriſt, for when he ſayde, I am, they al fel to the ground) Iohn. 18. but it was wrought within by the power of the ſpirite. Saint Auguſtine therefore, ſayth very well. Qui fecit te 
                  De verbis Apoſt. Ser. 15. 
                  ſine te, non te iustificat ſine te: Ergo fecit neſcientem, iuſtificat volentem. He that made thee without thee, doth not iuſtifie thée without thée, therefore he made thée, when thou kneweſt not: but he doth iuſtifie thée being willing. To this doe the wordes of Sainct Paule agrée when he ſayeth. Deus eſt qui operatur in vobis & velle, & operari. 
                  Phil. 2: It is God that worketh in you both the will and the

worke that is according to the will. But firſt the will. So that before we follow the drawer, we are by the ſame drawer made willing to follow. Thus doth S. Auſten, and ſo doe we (that Cerberus barketh ſo at) vnderſtand the will of man to be frée.
               To conclude this matter and to ſee what mans freewil is able to doe: ſée what S. Auſten ſayeth. Creatus eſt primus 
                  De verbis Apoſt. Ser. 11. 
                  homo in natura ſine culpa, in naturae ſine vitio, creatus eſt rectus, nō ſe fecit rectū. Quid ſe autem ipſe fecerit, notum eſt. Cadens è manu Figuli, fructus eſt. Regebat enim cum ipſe qui fecerat, voluit deſerere à quo factus erat, permiſit Deus tanquā dicens. Deſerat me, & inueniat ſe, & miſeria ſua probet, quia nihil poteſt ſine me. Hoc modo ergo oſtēdere voluit Deus homini, quid valeat liberum arbitrium ſine Deo. The firſt man was created in nature without blame, in nature without fault, he was created vpright, he did not make himſelfe vpright. It is knowne what he made himſelfe. Falling out of the hande of the Potter, he was broken. For he y• made him did gouerne him, but he was willing to forſake him that had made him. And God ſuffered him ſo to doe, as it were ſaying thus. Let him forſake me, that he maye finde himſelfe, and that he maye by his miſerie proue, that without me he can doe nothing. By this meane therfore would God ſhewe vnto man: what frée will is able to doe without God. This maye ſuffiſe to as many as will be ſatiſfied. But I feare me that Cerberus and his felowes are none of them.
               By this it appeareth that we runne not into the extremities as Cerberus ſayth we doe. For we neyther teache fatall deſtinie, nor popiſhe will libertie, but we affirme that man hath a choyſe, and that in ſome meaning the ſame is frée, and yet notwithſtanding, Gods forknowledge, predeſſination, and election, to be infallible. As ſhall more playnely appeare when I ſhall come to the

place wherein I am by Cerberus charged with the ſetting forth of ſuch a doctrine as is worthily myſſeliked of many.
               In the meane while I muſt ſay ſomething of y• wherin I with others be charged and playnely affirmed to be Pelagiās. And that it may appeare whether we be ſo or no: it ſhall be néedefull that we ſet downe the opinion of Pelagius, as we finde it written by S. Auſten in a booke of more authoritie than is that Epiſtle that Cerberus buildeth vpon.
               Saint Auſten being requeſted by one named Quod vult Deus, to write a Cataloge of hereſies: he ſatyſfieth hys requeſt. And thus he writeth of Pelagius hereſie. Pelagianorum est hereſis hoc tempore omniū recentiſsima, à Pelagio Monacho exorta. &c. At this time (ſayth he) there is the hereſie of the Pelagians, which is the neweſt of all, and ſprang out of one Pelagius, a Monke. Which maiſter one Celeſtius did in ſuch ſorte followe, that their followers are alſo called Celeſtines. Theſe men are ſuch enimies to the grace of God (whereby we are predeſtinated to be adopted or choſen to be his children through Ieſus Chriſt, and whereby we are deliuered from the power of darkeneſſe, that we may beleue in him, and be tranſlated into his kingdome, for which cauſe he ſayd: No man cōmeth vnto me except it be giuen vnto him of my Father: and wherby, Charitie is poured out in our hearts, that fayth may worke by loue) that they beleue, that man is able without it, to do all the cōmaundements of God, whereas if that were true, it might ſéeme that the Lord had in vaine ſayde, Sine me nihil potestis ſacere. Without me, you can do nothing.
               Whether we be of this mind with Pelagius or no: let all the world that ſéeth our writings or heareth our doctrine, iudge. Or whether Cerberus and his fellowes be

like to be of this minde, which finde fault with our doctrine, bycauſe we teach that there is an elected and choſen number to whome God hath giuen fayth, and hath poured out loue in their hearts, ſo that they maye come vnto Chriſt, and by their works of obediēce to Gods wil, ſhew forth the liuely fayth in Chriſt, that in their election they haue receyued freely at Gods hand.
               Let all the worlde, I ſay, iudge betwixte vs. We ſay that there is a certayne choſen number, which in mercy are choſen to be the children of God images of the ſonne of God Ieſus Chriſt, and inheritoures of his kingdome. And that none can be of this number, but thoſe onely to whome it is giuen fréely without any maner deſeruing, eyther paſt, preſent, or to come. And that they being thus choſen & predeſtinated, muſt alwayes acknowledge, that it is God that worketh in them, and that of them ſelues they are not able ſo much as to think a good thought. And yet aſſure them ſelues, that Hell gates can not preuayle agaynſt them, that is, that the power of the Diuell ſhall not be able to hurte them. And that though they be ſtill ſore aſſaulted, and ſometimes ſore woūded: yet they ſhal neuer be ouercome, but ſhal ouercome in Chriſt, and triumph with him in immortalitie for euer.
               But Cerberus and his company, ſay that al mankind is elected, and that there is no reprobation at all, and cō
                  ſequently, no election. For if there be none reſuſed, then is there none election, but a generall acceptation. And this their election they ſay is ſo vncertayne, that no man can thereby be certaine of his ſaluation, but al men muſt ſtill remayne in doubte of damnation by ſinne, whereas S. Paule hath ſayde, that there is no damnation to them Rom. 8. that be graſſed into Chriſt. And Chriſt himſelf ſaith, that it is not poſſible that the elected ſorte ſhoulde be ſeduced. Math. 24. They ſay alſo that the power of mans Frée will is to receiue

or refuſe the grace of God which is indifferently offred vnto al. Which if it be true, then muſt he be able alſo of himſelfe to do that God commaundeth, which is the playne errour of Pelagius. Well, I leaue theſe two opinions to the iudgement of the reader, to conſider which of them is moſt like to be that which Pelagius helde.
               But to giue a little more light to the Reader, I wyll note one ſentence more out of that that S. Auſten wryteth concerning the hereſie of Pelagius. Illam vero gratiam Dei, ſine qua nihil boni poſsumus facere, non eſse dicunt niſi in libero arbitrio, quod nullis ſuis praecedentibus meritis, ab illo accepit nostranatura, ad hoc tantum ipſo adiuuante per ſuam legem at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      doctrinam, vt diſcamus, quae facere, & quae ſperare debeamus. Nos autem ad hoc per donum ſpiritus ſancti, vt quae didiſcerimus eſse facienda faciamus. That is. They ſay (ſayth Auſten) that the grace of God, without which we are able to do no good thing, is not otherwiſe than in Frewil; which our nature hath receyued of him, not by any deſeruings that was in the ſame before, he only helping vs herevnto by his law and doctrine, that we may learne what we ought to do, and what to hope for. But we ſay to this, that through the gift of the holy Ghoſt, we may do thoſe things that we haue learned to be méete to be done. Here it is playne, that Pelagius maketh the grace of God nothing elſe but an helpe to the Frée wil of man. Whether Cerberus and his fellowes do ſo too, or not, let thē iudge that reade his words that are written in his aunſwere to this letter, and do weygh them with indifferent mindes.
               Now as touching that place that Cerberus citeth out of the ſermon De tempore, that is of the time. 191. Although I knowe what Auſten himſelfe writeth of all his Epiſtles and his ſermons, ſaying that he had not peruſed or retracted thē when he ſet forth his two bookes of Retractations, Retract. 2. in fine. neither doeth it appeare in any of his writings,

that euer he did retract them: Yet I will not reiecte it as none of Auſtens wordes, for the doctrine is ſound if it be rightly vnderſtande. It is poſſible for man by the power of God to be preſerued from Actuall ſinne, although he can neuer be without the ſinne of concupiſcence ſo long as he liueth in mortall fleſh. So is it poſſible alſo, yea it can not be choſen, but vnleſſe God doe by his grace ſtaye man, he ſhall commit Actuall ſinne after his regeneration, and of him ſelf man is not able to ſtay him ſelf from Vide. Lib. 2. De pecc. meritis & remiſs. Cap. 6. 7. it. But what make Auſtens wordes againſt vs? We confeſſe with Auſten, that man hath alwayes néede of Gods helpe, and we ſay with the ſame Auſten, that they do erre, which ſay that man can not auoyde ſinne, but yet as I haue ſayd before, being ſtayed by the power of God. For otherwiſe theſe wordes of Auſten ſhould be contrary to his owne wordes in his. 13. ſermon De verbis Apoſtoli, Of the wordes of the Apoſtle. Where he ſayeth thus. In hoc agone cum conſtigimus, Deum habemus ſpectatorem, in hoc agone cum laboramus, Deum poſcimus adiuterem. Si enim nos ipſe non adiuuat, non dico vincere, ſed nec pugnare poterimus. That is. When we ſight in this battayle, we haue God to beholde and loke vpon vs, when we are in daunger in this battayle, we do pray vnto God to helpe vs. But if he do not helpe vs, I ſay not that we ſhall not ouercome, but that we ſhall not be able ſo much as to fight.
               We wil not therefore ſet Auſten againſt him ſelf, but take that meaning of his wordes in one place, that may agrée with his wordes in another place. And ſo are we with Auſten, and not againſt him, as Cerberus layeth to our charge. Neyther do we holde with Pelagius in any vntruth, but if he do in any poynt confeſſe truth, then do we agrée with him, although S. Auſten ſhoulde ſay to the contrary. Loke better vpon your concluſion therefore (good maſter Cerberus) and learne to apply Scriptures

better than you haue applied the words of S. Paul to the Phillippians, elſe men will ſay ye vnderſtand not Phil. 4. S. Paule, for S. Paule doth not there goe about to aſcribe any thing to the power of his owne Frée will: but altogether to ſet forth the exceeding great mercy of God towards him who did ſtay him from falling both in aduerſitie and in wealth. As it may well appeare to al that will with iudgement reade the place.
               Your ſentence alſo cyted out of Eſoras: you ſhoulde 4. Eſdr. 4. knowe it not to be of ſuch authoritie, that it might ſerue in the triall of ſuch a cauſe as this is. But graunt it were of the greateſt authoritie. What can it make againſt vs which deny not that man hath a choiſe which in ſome ſort is free (as I haue declared) but do cōfeſſe that man which deſpiſeth the warnings and long ſufferings of God in this life, ſhall after this life, in paynes learne to vnderſtand what they did then. But procéede as you ſayde you would.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               There followeth the tenth, and the eleauenth errours, which are theſe: That our victorie commeth not of Gods helpe, but of free choyſe, and that remiſſion of ſinnes is not giuen to thē that repent, according to the grace and mercy of God, but according to the deſeruing and labor of them, whych by repentaunce are worthy of Gods mercy. O blaſphemie intollerable, O filthy puddle, and ſincke moſte execrable: full of ſtinking errours, full of damnable preſumption, like to the pride of Lucifer moſte abhominable: the deteſtable vileneſſe whereof is ſuch, that rather by exclamation, I haue thought it good to renoūce it, than with Scripture or reaſon to confute

it. All reaſon, and all Scripture, gyueth all glory vnto God. And this blaſphemous errour, taketh awaye all the glorye of al goodneſſe, from the father of all mercy, and God of al conſolation, and gyueth it vnto vile and wretched man, which hath of him ſelfe nothing that is good, but doeth altogether receiue it from the mercy and goodneſſe of God. Here concludeth Auſten wyth the errours of Pelagius, and ſayth, that all theſe errours he reuoked, or renounced in the generall Counſell of Paleſtine.
            
            
               Crowley.
               I haue not ſworne to finde faulte with all that Cerberus writeth in this his aunſwere, as it may ſeme that he hath, to reproue and depraue, all that I and other that haue, or do write or ſpeake of Gods predeſtination, do or haue affirmed. I will therefore ioyne with Cerberus in this deteſting and renoūcing of theſe Pelagian errours, as one that doth abhorre them no leſſe than he doth. And bicauſe man can ſée no further than theſe things that be outward: I do with all mine heart wiſh that he would make it knowen vnto men by ſuch meanes as maye be moſt to his glorye: whether we, or Cerberus and his felowes do in y• heart deteſt and abhorre theſe errors moſt. I will not enter into iudgement: but there is cauſe to ſuſpect that Cerberus and his ſorte be not ſo cleare, as by theſe wordess they would ſeme to be. But let God be Iudge.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               Thus haue I ſet forth in Englyſhe theſe errours of Pelagius together, that thou which art willing to

knowe the truth, and vnderſtande the matter euen as it is, mayeſt be able to iudge, who they are that holde of any of theſe errours, and not to credit the malice of certaine, whych to cloke their owne falſe opinions, accuſe other to be Pelagians, who in dede, from their verie heart and ſoule, abhoral theſe wicked opinions, and haue bene manye yeares willyng to beſtow their lyues againſt all theſe abhominable errours.
               Yet is there one thing whervnto Pelagius was compelled to ſubſcribe, whiche I haue not rehearſed among the errours afore ſayde, bicauſe the deniall therof, is of all our Goſpellers (as I ſuppoſe) receyued for no errour. The Article is this. Quod Infantes non baptizati, non ſolum regnum coelorum, verum etiam vitam aternam habere non paſsint. Herevnto did Pelagius ſubſcribe. That infantes whiche are not baptiſed, can not haue the Kingdome of God nor eternall lyfe. Which cruel opinion, that all vnbaptiſed children are damned, Auſten in manye places of hys workes doth boldly and vehemently mayntayne. But Caluin ſayth, Explodendam eſse illorum gloſsam palam eſt, qui oes non baptizatos, aternae morti adiudicant. It is cleare (ſayth he) that theyr gloſe is worthye wyth hiſſing or clappyng of handes, to be driuen out of the dores: which condemne vnto euerlaſting death, all thoſe, whych are not baptiſed, & bicauſe Caluin is with ſo many of vs, whych are Goſpellers, in auctoritie fully ſufficient to encounter with Auſten: I thynke it good (for ſhortneſſe) in this article to ſay no further.
            
            
               Crowley.
               
                  Cerberus, minding to enter into that which he promiſed

before (that is to ſhewe what part of our doctrine he miſſliketh) doeth conclude with his friende to whome he ſéemeth to write this aunſwere: as thoughe he beyng willing to know the truth, and vnderſtande the matter, coulde no more gyue credit to anye that writeth or ſpeaketh contrary to that which he hath here written. Whoſe doyngs therein, it pleaſeth him to terme malice, and the accuſing of ſuch as are of ſound beliefe, that thereby they may cloke their owne falſe opinions.
               But if it ſhall pleaſe that friend of his (if any ſuch be) or Cerberus himſelfe, to reade this my ſimple Apologie with indifferent mindes: it maye be that they will be of another minde then Cerberus doth in thys aunſwere ſhewe himſelfe to be, vnderſtanding that oure doyngs are neither malicious, nor yet the clokings of anye falſe opinions, but the true trauaile of them that ſeke the glory of God, and the ſaluation of his people, by the ſetting forth of the truth of his eternall and euerlaſting Predeſtination. Let God gyue the increaſe at hys good wyll and pleaſure.
               Yet one thing he woulde not ſeme to haue forgotten, but rather of purpoſe to haue deferred to thys place, that he might not ſeme to agrée with Pelagius in any point that might ſeme to be erronious. For he hath ſaid before. Here concludeth Auſten with the errours of Pelagius. Subtillye handled of Cerberus. For thoughe he conſent to that which Pelagius hath by his ſubſcription cō
                  firmed: yet he agréeth not with Pelagius in his errour, for he was inforced thus to ſubſcribe, & did afterwardes returne to his olde errours againe, as S. Auſten affirmeth in his Cataloge of hereſies. And if he denye it, yet conſenteth he not to Pelagius errour: but to Iohn Caluin, and vs Goſpellers, and to make vs beleue that he is one of vs in this point: he calleth that a cruel opinion

that Pelagius was conſtrained to ſubſcribe vnto, that is, that Infantes which are not baptiſed can not haue the kingdome of God, nor eternall lyfe. And to knit vp the knot withall, he ſetteth Iohn Caluin againſt S. Auſten, affirming, that for as muche as in the opinion of verye many of vs Goſpellers (for now Cerberus is one of vs) Iohn Caluin is in authoritie fully able to encoūter with S. Auſten: he will for ſhortneſſe ſake, ſay no further of this article. I woulde I had none occaſion here to thinke y• 
                  Cerberus vſeth a figure, which learned men cal Ironîa. For what a frumpe is this? That Caluin is in authoritie fully ſufficient, to encounter with Auſten. Surelye Cerberus may be a Goſpeller, as he tearmeth him ſelfe: but no Papiſt could deuiſe to giue a more kindely mocke to Caluin & vs Goſpellers, than this is. For who knoweth not, that the authoritie of wryters, is iudged to ſtande chiefely in the auncientneſſe of their writings, and then there is no compariſon to be made betwixt Caluin and S. Auguſtine, who liued .x. hundreth yere & more before this day. And Caluins modeſtie was neuer ſo little, as to compare him ſelfe with Auſten, but in all his writings he doth reuerence the iudgement of that learned Father, and doeth alledge his auctoritie in confirming of truthes, ſo far forth as the ſame doth not diſſent from truth. And Auſten neuer deſired to haue hys iudgement in matters to be otherwiſe receiued, than the ſame ſhould be found to be ſound, & according to the Scriptures. As appeareth in his. 7. Epiſtle, and in the Proeme of his thirde booke De Trinitate. Of the Trinitie. Whoſe woordes concerning this matter, being many, it ſhall ſuffiſe to note this ſhort ſentence. Noli meis litteris quaſi Scripturis canonicis inſtruire, ſed in illis, & quod non credebas cum inueneris, incunctanter crede: in istis autem, quod certum non habebas, niſi certum intellexeris, noli firmiter retinere. That is. Be not bounde vnto my

writings, as vnto the Canonical Scriptures: but when thou ſhalt finde in the Scriptures that whiche thou didſt not beleue, beleue it without any delay or doubting: but when thou findeſt that in my writings, which thou didſt not know certainlye before, except thou ſhalt certainlye vnderſtand it, do not ſtiſfely affirme it.
               I am ſure that Iohn Caluin did always obſerue this rule in reading S. Auſtens workes. And if he were nowe liuing woulde giue Cerberus the hire of a mocking Paraſite, thus to ſet him againſt S. Auſten. Yea, it might haue becommed Cerberus very well, either to haue bene ſhorter, and haue written no worde of this matter: or elſe to haue vttered his iudgemēt of this article, in ſuche ſorte that the reader might haue vnderſtand thereby the truth of the article, and howe Caluin & we that be Goſpellers do hold this article, not ſetting our ſelues againſt S. Auſten, but for good cauſe diſſenting in Iudgement, both from Pelagius and Auſten. And yet hauing a reuerend opinion of the one, do deteſt and abhorre the errour of the other.
               Well, I maye not be ſo ſhorte in this matter as Cerberus is, but I thinke it my dutie, hauing this occaſion, to do what ſhall lie in me, to let the reader vnderſtande that S. Auſten is not ſo much to be blamed for this cruell opinion, as Cerberus woulde haue men to thinke that Iohn Caluin doth recken him to be. Neither doth ye worthy inſtrument of God, mind to make the name of Auſten odious to the Chriſtian reader, as it ſemeth that Cerberus would make the names of both thoſe men of God.
               Marke therfore, gentle reader, what might cauſe Auſten ſome thing to ſwarue from the truth in thys article. He had to do with ſuche a one as denied Infantes to be ſpotted with Adams ſinne, and that therfore they neded no regeneration, and ſo conſequently no ſacrament of regeneration.

The abhomination of this errour cauſed Auſten to flye ſo far on the other ſide, that he had not ſuch a conſideration of the promiſe of God, as he ſhoulde haue had. And ſo affirmed more than once, that al that die with out baptiſme muſt nedes be damned. Let vs be contented that God hath by this errour ſhewed Saint Auſten to bée a man. And let vs giue him thankes for the abundaunce of good doctrine that this man hath lefte in writing, not doubting, but that that mercifull Lorde whom he ſerued, woulde not ſuffer him to ende his life in that errour (no more than he dyd in the Manicheis hereſie, which he did ſometime ſtoutly defende) althoughe it haue not pleaſed him to ſuffer it to appeare in writing, that euer he did acknowledge it to be an errour.
               As touching the opinion, that Caluin and we Goſpellers do holde concerning Infantes that die withoute baptiſme: it differeth ſomething from Auſten, but more from Pelagius. Yea, we doe as muche abhorre the errour of Pelagius, as Auſten did. For we affirme, and are able by the Scriptures to proue, that al Adams natural children are deade throughe Adams ſinne, and that none of them can be quickened and reuiued againe, otherwiſe than by Chriſt. And that ſo many as are not giuen vnto Chriſt, do ſtil remain in that ſinne, and cannot be ſaued. So far off are we from this Pelagian hereſie.
               Nowe that it maye appeare howe wée differ from S. Auſten: I will cite ſome matter out of the woorkes of maiſter Iohn Caluin. Not as Cerberus doth, to ſet him directly againſt Auſten, but to ſhewe how God hath reuealed vnto hys ſeruant Iohn Caluin, that ſecret that he had not reuealed vnto his ſeruant Auſten ſo fully: ſo far forth as we can finde written in his bookes. Firſt, we reade in the booke of maiſter Iohn Caluins Inſtitutions in the title of Pedobaptiſme or baptiſing of Chyldren,

theſe words folowing. Sed omiſsis cauillis, tenenda ſimplex est interpretatio quam attuli: neminem, donec renouatus fucrit aqua viua, hoc est ſpiritu, poſse ingredi in Regnum Dei. Iam est ex eo, explodendum eſse eorum commentum palam est: qui omnes non baptizatos, aeternae morti adiudicant. That is. But, all ſubtilties ſet a ſide, the ſimple interpretaciō that I haue made, muſt be holden, that is: that none can enter into the kingdome of God, til he be renewed by liuelye water, that is, the holy ghoſt. Now therfore, euen hereof it is manifeſt, that the falſe opinion or fantaſie of them that condemne to eternall death, all that be not baptiſed, is to be dryuen out with hiſſing and clapping of handes.
               Againe, the ſame Caluin ſayth in his Comment vpon the ſift Chapter to the Romaines. Vt miſera peccato haereditate potiaris, ſatis est eſse hominem, reſidet enim in carne & ſanguine. Vt Christi iustitia fruaris, ſidelem eſse neceſsarium est, quia ſide acquiritur eius conſortium. Infantibus peculiari ratione communicatur. Habent enim in ſoedere ius adoptionis, quo in Chrisſti communionem co
                        •
                     ptantur. De piorum liberis loquor, ad quos promiſsio gratiae dirigitur. Nam alij à communi ſorte nequaquam eximuntur. That is. To enioy the miſerable enheritaunce of ſinne: it is enough to be a man: for if dwelleth in fleſh and bloud. But to enioy the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, it is required of neceſſitie, that a man be faithfull, for the company or felowſhip of Chriſt is obtained by ſaith. To Infants, it is after a certaine peculiar maner cōmunicated. For they haue in the couenaunt, the right of adoption, wherby they are adopted into the communion of Chriſt. I ſpeake of the children of the godly, vnto whom the promiſe of mercye is directed. For others are not deliuered from that lot, that is common to all men.
               By theſe wordes of Caluin, it appeareth how we differ from Auguſtine, for we are of one minde with Caluin, who denieth not, that the children of the vnfaithfull

that dye without baptiſme, do remaine in the ſame ſtate that the ſinne of the firſte man brought all mankinde vnto. We differ therfore, only in that we affirme that the children of the godlye doe appertaine to the couenant of God, and therefore do not periſhe though they be preuented by death. Whether Auſten continued to the ende in that minde that he ſheweth him ſelfe in certaine of hys writings concerning this matter: it is vncertaine, for in his Retractations there is no mention therof. But if he did, this onely is the difference betwixt him & vs, that we aſcribe that to the couenāt, promiſe, and election of God, that he aſcribeth to ye ſacraments. And as it appeareth in his. 3. booke of queſtions vpon the olde Teſtament, he him ſelfe teacheth the ſame doctrine that we doe. His wordes be theſe, in the. 84. Queſtion. Proinde colligitur, inuiſibilem ſanctificatimem quibuſdam adfuiſse, at

                  ſacramentis, quae pro temporum diuerſitate mutata ſunt, vt alia tunc fuerint, & alia medo ſint: Viſibilem vero ſanctificationem, quae fieret per viſibilia ſacramenta, ſine ista iuuiſibili poſse adeſse, non poſse prodeſse. Nec tamen ideo ſacramentum contemnendum est: nam contemptor eius, inuiſibiliter, ſanctificari nullo modo potest. Hinc est quod Cornelius. &c. That is to ſay. We do therfore gather, that certaine men haue had the inuiſible ſanctification, and haue bene benefited therby, without the viſible Sacramentes, which are according to the diuerſitie of the tune chaunged, ſo that then they were of one ſort and nowe of another: And that the viſible ſanctification, which ſhould be wrought by the viſible ſacramentes, maye be preſent without this that is inuiſible, but can not be profitable wythout it. And yet is not the ſacrament therfore to be contemned: for he that contemneth it, can by no meanes be made holy inuiſibly. Hereof it came, that Cornelius and thoſe that were wyth him, when they were perceyued, to be inuiſiblye ſanctified by

the holye Ghoſt that was poured into them, were notwithſtanding baptiſed. &c.
               Theſe words of S. Auſten, do plainly declare of what minde he was when he wrate theſe queſtions. And thys booke of queſtions, with the reaſt, he hath retracted and Retractat. lib. 2. cap. 55. peruſed againe, allowing this ſentence of his therin as it appeareth in the. 55. chapter of his ſecond boke of Retractations. Cerberus had no cauſe therfore, to ſet Iohn Caluin againſt Auſten, for we take that to be vndoubtedlye the doctrine of Auſten, which we finde in his Retractations, and not reuoked.
               But Cerberus purpoſe was, craftily to cauſe all that would harken vnto him, to eſtéeme both Caluin & vs, as moſt arrogant heretikes, that wyll not ſticke to compare one of our time with that auncient Father, and to accept his iudgement, without either reaſon or learning, directly againſt the iudgement of him, whom al the Church of Chriſt hath theſe many hundred yeres worthily reuerenced. For who ſéeth not, that Cerberus can not be one of thoſe Goſpellers that do accompt Caluin to be fully ſufficient in auctoritie to encounter with Auſten: ſith he writeth ſo bitterly, againſt all thē that eyther write or preach that, that Caluin hath in writing moſt euidently proued and defended: Yea, he alleageth Auſten againſt Caluins doctrine, and woulde ſeme thereby to triumphe ouer him and all that be of his minde.
               As for the place that he cyteth out of Caluin, I leaue for Cerberus to ſeke out at his leyſure, and when he hath founde it, to note where it may be ſound
                     •
                  . But I beleue it will be harde for him to find in Caluines workes, that ſentence in thoſe wordes.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               
                  
There remaineth then, as before I promiſed, briefly to note thoſe thyngs, which I thinke worthye to be reproued, about the doctrine of Predeſtination, as it is now a dayes taught of many. Wherin leaſt I ſhould ſeme to ſpeake without aſſured grounde, and bicauſe wordes in preaching, in talke, or diſputation (wherof I haue heard great abundance in thys matter) may raſhly paſſe with ſmall aduiſement, and eyther eaſely be denied or ſoone forgotten: I am determined to touch nothyng but their very wordes, whych are ſet forth in Print. And bicauſe the taking and aunſweryng of their whole bookes were a matter long and tedious, being commonlye ſtuffed on the one ſide, wyth an heape of opprobrious and outragious wordes againſt ſuch priuate perſons as they take in hand to write agaynſt: and on the other ſide filled, rather wyth obſcure ſubtelties, than wyth plaine affirmations, I haue thought it beſt therfore, to take certayne ſentences whych contayne manifeſt affirmatiōs, out of diuers late printed Englyſhe bookes, wherein the ſumme and effect of this doctrine (which manye doe for iuſt cauſe miſlike, is fully, plainelye, and ſimplye declared.
            
            
               Crowley.
               Nowe Cerberus beginneth to growe to the performance of his promiſe, in noting thoſe things in the doctrine of predeſtinatiō now preached, as ſeme to him mete to be reproued. And by the way, he will not taunt vs, but thus he ſayth, that in preaching, talking, and reaſoning, wordes may paſſe vs raſhly and with ſmall aduiſement, and be either eaſely denied, or ſone forgotten: Wherfore he will touche nothing but that which we haue written

and ſet forth in Print. Well, contented, but yet I would Cerberus ſhould knowe that we neither preache, talke, nor diſpute with ſuch raſhneſſe or ſmall aduiſement, but that we are able, and will, by Gods helpe, ſtande to all that we haue ſpoken therein, and he is able to charge vs withall. As for the outragious wordes that we vſe towardes them that we write againſt, ſhalbe found modeſt inough, when they ſhalbe compared with the words that in this hys aunſwere he vſeth towards vs. Let him therfore procede in noting thoſe things that he miſliketh.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               I reade in an Englyſhe booke ſet forth by Robert Crowley, and entituled, the confutation of .xiii. Articles. &c. theſe wordes. Adam therfore, beyng ſo perfect a creature, that there was in him no luſt to ſinne, and yet ſo weake, that of himſelfe he was not able to withſtand the aſſault of the ſubtile ſerpent: no remedye, the onely cauſe of his fall, muſt nedes be the predeſtination of God.
               Thou ſeeſt, dearly beloued, in the concluſion of this ſentence one point declared, wherin the controuerſie doth conſiſt. For where he plainlye affirmeth, that Gods predeſtination is the only cauſe of Adams fall, which is the ſountayne of all ſinne: other hauing a much more reuerend opinion of God and of hys holye predeſtination, do ſet their fote, or rather their heart and ſoule, agaynſt their ſayd concluſion. Eſtemyng it far better to be torne in manye thouſande pieces, than to thynke or ſay, that Gods foreordinance or predeſtination, is the cauſe of any ſinne or euil. I beſech thee, let not thine eies be blinded, or thy minde muſfled wyth malice, eyther agaynſt the

one partie or the other, but in the ballāce of vpright iudgement, waye the difference. The one ſayth (as in this concluſion manifeſtlye appeareth, and as afterwarde, yet more plainly he affirmeth) that the predeſtination of God, is the onelye cauſe of Adams ſinne, and ſo conſequently of all euill. The other affirmeth directly contrary. That God or his predeſtination, is the cauſe of no ſinne or euyll, but the only cauſe of all goodneſſe and vertue. And herewyth agreeth the holye and diuine Apoſtle Sainct Iohn in hys Epiſtle ſaying. All that is in the worlde, as the 1. Iohn. 2. concupiſcence of the fleſhe, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father. Al good things that are in the worlde, are no doubt of God our heauenly Father: but whatſoeuer in the worlde, is concupiſcence, luſt, ſinne, euill or wickedneſſe, the ſame is not of God our heauenlye Father: S. Iohn doeth piainly and preciſely affirme. The lyke playneneſſe vſeth alſo the holye man Ieſus the ſonne of Sirach, in theſe wordes. Say not thou it is the Lordes fault, Eccle. 15. that I am gone by, for thou ſhalt not doe the thing that God hateth, ſaye not thou, he hath cauſed me to go wrong, for he hath no neede of the vngodlye. The verye ſame thing is plainely declared, in theſe Scriptures folowyng, and in other places almoſt innumerable. Pſal 5. Pro. 19. Ieremie. 7. &. 19. Oſeae. 13. Iob. 34. &. 36. Rom. 7. 1. Corin. 14.

Neither the falles of them that fall, nor the wickedneſſe of them that be wicked, nor the luſte of them that offende, hath the predeſtination of God, eyther prouoked, moued or compelled, but without doubt he hathe forcordeyned his iudgement, wherby he will recompence euerye man, according as he hath done, whether it be good or euyll, the whiche ſhoulde be no iudgement, if men did ſinne by the will of God.
            
            
               Crowley.
               I do acknowledge that this Engliſh booke, that Cerberus ſaith he hath read, was of my writing. I acknowledge alſo, that Cerberus hath cited the wordes truely, euen as I wrate them. But that I ment by them as Cerberus doth conclude vpon them: I vtterly deny. For he concludeth that I haue affirmed, that Gods predeſtination is the onely cauſe of all euill. Whiche I neuer ment to teache, neither do my wordes, duely conſidered, giue any occaſion of ſuch concluſion.
               I graunt, my words might haue bene more explaned, and my meaning ſet forth more at large, and all occaſions of ſuche calumniations cut off, if I had ſene that before I wrate that booke, whiche I thanke my Lord God, I haue ſene ſince. Wherfore I minde by the help of God to do that now ye I was not ſo well able to do then, that the Reader may perceiue, that I haue with Auſten profited in writing. My words that Cerberus citeth, are theſe. August. prol. 1. lib. Retract. Adam therefore, being ſo perfect a creature, that there was in him no luſt to ſinne, and yet ſo weak, that of him ſelfe he was not able to withſtande the aſſault of the ſubtile

ſerpent: no remedie, the only cauſe of his fall, muſt nedes be the predeſtination of God. Cerberus findeth no fault with any of theſe wordes, till he commeth to no remedy. And then no remedy, I muſt be condemned as one that affirmeth Gods Predeſtination to be the onelye cauſe of Adams ſinne, and ſo conſequentlye of all ſinne. But I haue not ſaide that Gods predeſtination was the onelye cauſe, or anye cauſe of Adams ſinne. My wordes be that Gods Predeſtination is the onelye cauſe of Adams fall. Nowe Cerberus can not ſée howe Adams fall may be good, and therefore he ſayeth that it is the fountaine of all ſinne, and that to be the cauſe of that fall, is to be the cauſe of all ſinne. But ſuche as haue eyes to ſée, do ſée, that as Gods predeſtination is the cauſe of Adams fall: ſo Adams fall is good. For it is the meane whereby God hath ſhut vp all vnder vnbeliefe, that he Rom. 11. might haue mercye on all. And the meane whereby the Galath. 3. Scripture ſhutteth vp all vnder ſinne, that the promiſe which is of the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, might be giuen to the faithfull.
               I write therefore now, as I wrate before in my Conſutation of Shaxtons Articles: that for aſmuch as there was in Adam nothing to moue him to ſinne (for luſt to do contrarie to Gods wil, was not yet entred into him) & Sathan the enimy had no power then, neither hath anye power yet, ouer anye creature of God, further than God doth limit and appoint him: it muſt nedes followe, that the only cauſe that Adam was aſſaulted & ouerthrowen by Satan, was the predeſtination of God, which is euer all one with his vnſearcheable will & counſel. The fall of Adam thus conſidered, neyther is, nor can be counted ſinne: for it is the performance of Gods purpoſe, whiche is euer good, although vnſearchable by mans feble vnderſtanding. And yet I do not denie Adams fall to be ſinno

in Adam himſelf: for it was Factum cōtramandatum Dei. A dede done contrary to the commaſidentent of God. And ſo it had a cauſe in Adam himſelfe, which was the power of his wil, whereby he conſented to ye enticement of Satan, who vſed the woman as his inſtrument therin. Of thys will and the power therof, Sainct Auſten writeth thus: De libero arbitrio, lib. 3. Cap. 18. Cum autem de libera voluntate rectè faciendi loqui
                        〈…〉
                     : de illa ſilicet in qua homo factus est, loquimur. When we ſpeak of the will that is frée to do wel, we ſpeake of that will wherein man was made. And againe in his booke De natura & gratia, Cepite. 43. ſpeaking of man, he ſaith. Quis enim eum neſcit, ſanum & inculpabilem factum, & libero arbitrio, at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ad iustè viuendum libera poteſtate constitutum? Who knoweth not that man was made found & vnblameable, and that he was ordeined with frée choyſe, and frée power or libertie to liue righteouſly? And againe in his boke De Correptione & gratia. Cap. 11. Istam gratiam non habuit homo primus, qua nunquam vellet eſse malus: ſed ſanè habuit in qua ſi permanere vellet, nunquam malus eſset, & ſine qua etiàm cum libero arbitrio, bonus eſse non poſset, ſed eam tamenper liberum arbitrium deſerere poſset. Nec ipſum ergo Deus eſse voluit ſine ſua gratia, quē reliquit in ſuo libero arbitrio: quoniam liberum arbitrium ad malum ſufficit, ad bonum autem nihil est, niſi adiuuetur ab omnipotenti bono: quod adiutorium ſi homo ille per liberum non deſeruiſset arbitrium, ſempereſset bonus: ſed deſeruit & deſertus eſt. Tale quippe erat adiutorium quod deſereret cum vellet, & in quo permancret ſi vellet, non quo ſieret vt vellet. The firſte man had not thys grace, whereby he ſhoulde neuer be willing to be euill: but yet he had that grace, whereby he might haue bene alwayes preſerued from euill, if he would haue continued therin, and without which alſo he coulde not by frée will, be good, but yet he was able by frée wil to forſake it. God therfore would not haue him to be without his grace, whō he had left in

his owne fréewill. For fréewil is able inough to do euil, but to do good it hath no power at al, except it be holyē by the almightie goodneſſe: which helpe, if that man had not by fréewill forſaken, he ſhoulde haue bene good for euer, but he did forſake, and was forſaken. For the helpe was ſuch, that he might forſake it when he woulde, and ſuche wherin he might remaine if he woulde, not ſuch whereby it might come to paſſe that he ſhould be willing.
               By theſe places of S. Auſten, we maye ſee of what minde he was concerning the frée will of man before his fall. It was ſuche that hée mighte conſent to what hée woulde. But the grace to be willing to conſent to nothing but that which was good, was not giuen vnto mā, that man might haue experience of the power of his own will, and ſo for euer after aſcribe al the glory to him that worketh all in all.
               The cauſe of Adams fall therfore, euen by the iudgement of S. Auſten (of whome Cerberus maketh ſuche boaſt) was not in himſelf: For God had fore appoynted, that by that meanes man ſhould haue experience of hymſelfe, and ſo learne to truſt in one ſtronger than hymſelf. But the cauſe that made his fall ſinne, was in himſelfe. For he did willinglye conſent to the perſwaſion of his wife, who alſo had in like maner conſented to the perſuaſion of the Serpent.
               If Cerberus could conſider the fall of the firſt man after this ſort: he would neuer conclude, that I teaching that the Predeſtination of God was the onelye cauſe of mans fall, ſhoulde withall conclude, that it is the onlye cauſe of all ſinne and euill. For I do not teache that it is the cauſe of any euill or ſinne at all.
               In vaine therfore, doeth Cerberus make his Antiteſis or compariſon of contraryes, when he ſayth. The one affirmeth that the Predeſtination of God is the onelye

cauſe of Adams ſinne, and ſo conſequentlye of all euill: And the other affirmeth directly contrary, that God or his Predeſtination is the cauſe of no ſinne or euil. And much more vaine is it, that he citeth ſo manye teſtimonies of Scripture to that purpoſe. For I affirme that which he woulde make men beleue I denye, and denye that which he would haue men to thinke I do affirme.
               But one thing I woulde gladly learne of Cerberus. That is, where he findeth, eyther in Scripture, or in auncient writer, that Adams fall is the fountayne of all euill. We may manifeſtly proue by Scripture, that ſinne was before Adam fell, otherwiſe there coulde haue bene no tempter to entice him to ſinne. For God tempteth no man to euill. And man had in himſelfe no concupiſcence Iacob. 1. or luſt to ſinne: therfore euill was before Adam fell. And conſequently, Adams ſal was not the fountain of al euil.
               Sainct Auſten in the .ix. Chapter of his firſte booke of Retractations ſayth, that when he with others had diligently ſearched from whence euill might ſpring: it was agréed vpon amongſt them, that it had none other fountaine than the frée choyſe of the will. Mans fall can not then be the fountaine of all euill: for there was euill in Aungels before man was made, and that ſprang out of the frée choyſe of the will that was in the Aungelles.
               But graunt, that the fall of man had bene the fountayne of all euill: might not Gods predeſtination be the cauſe of mans fal, but it muſt ſtraight waye follow conſequentlye that the ſame is the cauſe of all the euill that ſpringeth therof? Then tell me (maiſter Cerberus) how it may be, that Gods predeſtination is not the cauſe of all the euill that ſpringeth of the frée choyſe of will. For this ye wil not deny, I am ſure, that God hath predeſtinated, both men and Aungels to haue the frée choiſe of wil. And his will alone, according to which he hath predeſtinated

all things, is the cauſe why men and Aungels haue the frée choyſe of wil. Shal we ſay therefore, that conſequently it is the cauſe of all euill? bicauſe it is the cauſe of that whereout all euilles do ſpring? No thou hell hound, not ſo. God is altogether good, and the fountaine of all goodneſſe, and from him can ſpring nothing that is not good. All thoſe things therfore that ſpring out of the frée choiſe of the will, are exceding good, as God, or his predeſtination is the cauſe of them, and the euill that is in them, commeth of the inſtrument whereby God doth worke thoſe things. I pray you therfore, loke better vpon your conſequently. &c.
               As for the ſentence that Cerberus citeth oute of S. Auſten: Non ergo caſus ruentium. &c. I thynke if a man ſhould vpon a Moneth warning, require to ſée the place where S. Auſten writeth thoſe wordes: it would be hard for Cerberus to ſhewe it him. And therfore I blame him not, though he haue not quoted the place. But to do him a pleaſure, I haue ſought it in S. Auſtens workes and founde it In decimo. articulo falſo Augustino impoſito. In the x. of thoſe articles that were falſlye aſcribed to S. Auſten. Of what auctoritie that booke of S Auſten is, may eaſely appeare to them that will reade his Retractations: for it is not mentioned among the bookes that he retracted, and reformed in ſuche pointes as he himſelfe miſſeliked. But leſt maiſter Cerberus ſhould ſaye (as the Papiſtes vſe to ſay of the Proteſtantes, and as ſome Frée wil men haue ſaid of vs that teache the doctrine of predeſtination) that this is the common ſhift of all heretikes and obſtinate defenders of vntruthes, to diminiſh the auctoritie of Scriptures and ſayings of Doctours that are alleaged againſt them, by ſaying that the ſame are not autentike, or that they maye be ſuſpected not to be the writings of them in whoſe name they be ſet abrode: I will admit

this ſaying of S. Auſten as his owne, and that therein he ment as he wrote, and that his meaning is true. Let vs weigh the wordes of S. Auſten therfore, and ſee how his meaning may be true, & yet agrée wyth the doctrine that we teache. The predeſtination of God (ſayth he) hath neither ſtirred vp, counſelled, nor enforced, the falles of thē that do ruſh downe headlong, nor the malignitie of them that be wicked, nor the deſiers of them that do ſinne: but doubtleſſe he hath predeſtinated his iudgement, whereby he will rewarde euerye man according to his doings, whether the ſame be good or euill. Whiche iudgement ſhould not be, if it were the will of God that men ſhoulde ſinne. I haue tranſlated theſe wordes ſomewhat otherwiſe than Cerberus doth. But whether of vs both better expreſſe the meaning of S. Auſten, let the learned iudge. And whether I haue not tranſlated theym ſo that they may ſerue better for Cerberus purpoſe, than as they are tranſlated by himſelfe. Let vs therefore loke to the meaning, and howe they make with vs or againſt vs.
               Sainct Auſten teacheth that Gods predeſtinatiō, doth not ſtir vp, entice or enforce any man to ſal, to be wicked, or to haue a deſire to ſinne. And which of vs doth teach ye cōtrary? Euen you ſir (ſaith Cerberus) when ye ſay that ye Predeſtination of God, muſt nedes be the only cauſe of Adams fall. To this I haue ſufficiently aunſwered before, if any aunſwere wil ſatiſfie Cerberus. But yet for further aunſwere I ſaye nowe, that I haue not at anye time ſaide or written, that Gods predeſtination did ſtirre vp, entice or driue Adam to fall. Wherfore I haue not taught contrary to S. Auſten in thys pointe. But Cerberus will ſaye that our meaning is not alone with S. Auſtens. Let vs therefore examine S. Auſtens meaning. I vnderſtand his meaning to be, that when man doeth fall, is wicked, or deſireth to ſinne: his will is not by

Gods Predeſtination ſtirred vp, enticed or compelled thervnto, but doth fréely conſent therevnto being ſtirred vp, prouoked and driuen forwarde by the tempter, and by none other meane, if we ſpeake of the firſt man, for in him was not, before his fall, that concupiſcence that is nowe in vs, & was in him after his fall. Whether thys be ye true meaning of S. Auſten or no, let the learned iudge. And why may not the ſame meaning be gathered of my wordes, when I ſaye, that Adam being ſo perfect a creature, that there was in him no luſt to ſinne, and yet ſo weake, that of himſelfe he was not able to withſtand the aſſault of the ſubtile ſerpent: no remedie, the onlye cauſe of his fall muſt nedes be the Predeſtination of God. I ſay not, that Gods Predeſtination did ſtir, prouoke, or dryue him forward to fall: And why maye I not meane as S. Auſten doth in the eleauenth chapter of his booke, De correptione & gratia, where he ſayeth (as I haue cited before) Nec ipſum ergo Deus eſse voluit ſine ſua gratia, quem reliquit in ſu
                        •
                      libero arbitrio: quoniam liberum arbitrium ad malum ſufficit, ad bonum autem nihil est, niſi adiuuctur ab omnipotēti bono: quod adiutoriū, ſi homo ille, per liberum non deſeruiſsaet arbitrium, ſemper eſset bonus, ſed deſeruit, & deſertus est. Tale quippe erat adiutoriū quod deſereret cum vellet, & in quopermaneret ſivellet, non quo fieret vt vellet.
               
               God therfore (ſayth Auſten) would not ſuffer him to be without his grace, whom he had left in hys owne frée choiſe: for free will is able inough to do euill, but to do good it hath no power at all, except it be holpen of the almighty goodneſſe: which help, if that man had not by his frée wil forſaken, he ſhould haue bene good for euer, but he did forſake & was forſaken. For the help was ſuch that he might forſake it when he woulde, and ſuche wherein he might remaine if he woulde, not ſuch whereby it might come to paſſe that he ſhould be willing.
               
                  
Doth not S. Auſten affirme here, that the help of God which Adam had, was not ſuche, that by it he might be willing neuer to forſake it? And what other cauſe of this can you find: thā the Predeſtination of God, which is according to his euerlaſting will, vnto the whiche all things are and muſt be ſubiect.
               If Cerberus will not be ſatiſfied with thys: let him remember the ſaying of S. Paule, which S. Auſten doth Rom. 11. ſo often vſe, to ſtop the mouthes of the vnaunſwereable enimies of Gods frée grace and predeſtination. O altitudo diuitiarum, ſapientiae & ſcientiae Dei. Quám incomprehenſibilia ſunt iudicia cius, & inuestigabiles viae cius? O the depeneſſe of the richeſſe of the wiſedome and knowledge of God. Nowe incomprehenſible are hys iudgementes, and hys wayes paſt finding out? Stay here, maiſter Cerberus, go no further I charge you, leſt ye be thruſt headlong into hell for your proube preſumption.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               And although there be ſome places of Scripture, whervpon they would ground this opiniō, that men ſhould ſinne by the wyll of God, or that God ſhould predeſtinate or ordeyne men to ſinne, as where it is ſayde, that God hardened the heart of Pharao, and ſuch like: yet partayneth it nothing to that purpoſe, if it be wayed with the reſt of the Scriptures. For as Auſten ſaith. Ipſe quaſi cos indurat, quia iusto iudicio indurari ſinit. Lib. de eſsentia Diuinitatis. He doth (ſaith Auſten) as it were harden them, bicauſe, that with his iuſt iudgemēt, he ſuffreth them to be hardened. And in his booke, De libero arbitrio & gratia. Cap. 21. he ſayeth: Where at any time we reade in the ſcripture, that mē be ſeduced, or their hearts hardened of God: there

may we not doubt, but that their wicked deſeruings went before, leſt ye runne (ſayth he) into the ſaying of Salomon. Inſipientia viri violat vias cius. Deum autem cauſatur in corde ſuo. The fooliſhneſſe of a man defileth his wayes, but he ſayeth in his heart, God is the cauſe of this hardening of heart.
               Melancthon, in his common places, ſpeaketh very plainely, ſaying: Nec figure illae verborum offendunt. &c. Neither, ſayth he, do theſe figuratiue ſpeaches offēd. As I wil harden the heart of Pharao & ſuch like. For it is certaine, that in the Hebrew phraſe, they ſignify a permiſſion or ſuffring, and not an effectuall wyl of God, as, Lead vs not into temptation, that is to ſay, Suffer vs not to be led into temptation. Theſe are Melancthons woordes. And marke what he ſayth of the Hebrew phraſe, for al men know him to be a man learned. But to be ſhort, it is ſurely to be maruelled at, that although they do thus accuſe Gods Predeſtination, to be the only cauſe of Adams fal (which is in dede, not onely ſinne, but alſo the very welſpring of al wickedneſſe, and the filthy foūtaine of all our vncleāneſſe) yet they dare affirme themſelues to be the only friendes and louers of Gods Predeſtination, & al others to be the enimies of Gods holy Predeſtination, which doe not ſubſcribe to this their fantaſticall imagination. Moreouer, if it ſhould be ſaid, that they make God the Autor of ſinne, they would crie naye, and ſaye they were ſlaundered. But, whether God be not the autor of that, whereof he is the onelye cauſe: let the vncorrupted heart iudge. Alſo to ſaye the truth, when they ſee their time and place, they are bolde inoughe, yea, euen to vſe the terme Autor, in that ſame manifeſt ſenſe, as in a boke ſet forth by Iohn Knox, againſt an aduerſarie of Gods Predeſtination

(as he calleth hym) where, in the. 158. pagine he ſayth thus.
               Therfore, whatſoeuer the Ethnickes and ignorant did attribute vnto Fortune, wee aſſigne to the prouidence of God. And ſtraight way he ſayth. We ſhall iudge nothing to come of fortune, but that all cōmeth by the determination of hys counſell. And furder, it diſpleaſeth him when we eſteme any thing to procede from any other, ſo that we do not behold hym and know him, not only the principall cauſe of al things: but alſo the auctour, appointing al things, to the one part or to the other by his counſell.
               Marke well his wordes, and the very ſenſe therof. All commeth of God, ſayth he, God is the principal cauſe, and God is the auctour of it whatſoeuer it be. God appointeth al things, both to the one part and to the other, both to the wicked and to the godly all things, nothing is excepted, aſwell damnation as ſaluation, as well ſinne as vertue, as well wickedneſſe as holyneſſe, yea, if it happen to be murder it ſelfe, for that a little before he rehearſeth. Whatſoeuer it be, it procedeth from none other (ſaith he) but frō God, God ſo hath appointed it. God is the principal cauſe of it. Yea, and not onely the principall cauſe: but alſo the auctor of it. Here ſeeſt thou thoſe playne termes, which ſometime for a little nice liſpyng, they can not, or will not ſpeake, that God is the auctour of all murder and miſchiefe. As for fortune, I knowe it to be an Heatheniſh fable, but where he ſaith, that God is not onelye the principall cauſe, but alſo the auctour of all things, without any exception: and that whatſoeuer the Ethnickes attributed vnto fortune, that ſame we ought to aſcribe to the prouidēce of God: it is ſuche a wide wandring and large blaſphemye,

as hath not bene lightlye heard. For who knoweth not, that vnto fortune the Ethnickes aſcribed treaſon, and craftie conſpiracie. As where they call her Inſidioſa, Perſida & Maleſida. Vnto fortune they aſcribe cruell murder, and tyrannicall miſchiefe. As when they call her Aspera, Dura, Saeua, Truculenta. Vnto fortune they aſcribed filthy luſt and impudent bawdrye: as when they call her Lenocinaus, Bruta and Impudens. Vnto fortune they aſcribed, ſcornefull pride, and vaine glory, calling her, Imperioſa, Procax and Superba. Vnto fortune they aſcribed, beaſtly blindneſſe, & rude ignoraunce, calling her Coeca, and Exoculata. To conclude, vnto fortune, the Ethnickes aſcribed all peruerſe and peſtilent wickedneſſe, and all abhomination deteſtable, calling her Nefaria, Abhominanda & Improba. Yet ſaye theſe profeſſors of deſtiny: whatſoeuer the Ethnickes aſcribed vnto fortune, that ſame ought we to attribute to the prouidēce of God: yea and God is the very auctor, the principal cauſe, and the only cauſe therof.
            
            
               Crowley.
               
                  Cerberus ſuppoſeth nowe, that he hath pulled from vs y• foūdation of our faith. For he ſaith, that thoſe ſcriptures that we would ground our opinion vpon, appertaine nothing to that purpoſe, when they be weighed with the reſt of the ſcriptures. For the triall of this matter it ſhalbe mete for me at this time, plainly to ſet down in writing, what the opinion is, that I and other of my minde in this matter of Predeſtination, doe holde. And then, what thoſe Scriptures be that Cerberus meaneth of, conferring the ſame with as manye other places of ſcripture, as haue any ſhewe of a contrarye meaning: ſo

ſhall it appeare what Cerberus hath wonne by that he citeth out of Auſten and Melancthon. Firſt, we hold that what ſoeuer hath bene from the beginning, is nowe, or ſhal be to the ende and for euer: was in Gods purpoſe without beginning, and predeſtinated or foreappointed to be in the time and order that it hath ben, is, or ſhal be: ſo that nothing hath, doth or ſhal come to paſſe otherwiſe than he hath withoute beginning purpoſed and foreappointed the ſame. The reaſons that we ſtay vppon, are theſe. Gods power is abſolute, ſo that what he will do, hé is able to do, and what he will haue done, can not be letted by any cōtrary power, & what he wil not haue done, can not by anye power be done. But his power coulde not be abſolute. &c. if ought might be done otherwiſe thā he hath purpoſed & appointed. Therfore, all things come to paſſe, euen as he hath without beginning purpoſed & appointed the ſame. Another reaſon is thus. Gods wiſedome is moſt perfect; ſo that whatſoeuer he doeth, is ſo done, that the doing thereof cannot be repented: But if ought that he doth, might fal out otherwiſe, thā he ment it ſhould, whē he did it, it ſhould folow that his wiſdome were not moſt perfect, for it is not y• point of a wiſe man to ſaye, I thought not that it woulde haue ſo happened. Therfore nothing hath, doeth, or ſhall happen otherwyſe than he ment it ſhould, when he did firſt ordeine it. The third reaſon is; that his foreknowledge can not be deceiued, but euen as he did foreſée, and know before hande, that things ſhould come to paſſe, ſo they haue, be, and ſhal be brought to paſſe. But this coulde not be, if things ſhould be done, otherwiſe thā by his appointmēt. Therfore al things haue, are and ſhal be done by his appointment. Theſe be the chief reaſons that we ſtay vpon. The ſcriptures that we do moſt ſtay vpō, are theſe. Conuenerunt enim in ciuitate ista, aduerſus ſanctum filium tuū Ieſum quem

vnxiſti, Herodes & Pontius Pilatus, cū gentibus & populis Iſrael: ad faciendum quaecun

Actes the iiij. Chapter.
               Againe in the .vij. of Exod. it is thus written. Dixit

Se dego indurabo cor eius, et multiplicabo ſigna & ostenta mea in terra Egypti, & non audiet vos. And y• Lord ſaid vnto Moſes. Behold I haue appointed thée to be Pharaos God, & Aaron thy brother ſhalbe thy Prophet. Thou ſhalt ſpeak vnto him all thoſe things that I ſhall commaunde thée, and he ſhall ſpeake vnto Pharao, that he let the children of Iſraell depart out of his land. But I will harden his heart, and will multiply my wonders and ſignes in the land of Egypt, and he ſhall not hearken vnto you.
               Moreouer, in the .xix. Chapter of the .iiij. booke of the 4. Reg. 19. Kings, we reade thus. Venerunt ergo ſerui Regis Ezechiae ad Iſaam, Dixit
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      eis Iſaas. Haec dicetis domino vestro. Haec dicit Dominus. Noli timere à facie ſermonū quos audiſtis, quibus blaſphemanerunt pueri Regis Aſsyriorum me. Ecce ego immittam ei▪ ſpiritum, & audiet nuntium, & reuertetur in terram ſuam, et deijciam eum gladio in terra ſua. And in the ende of the ſame Chapter it is written thus. Cum
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      adoraret in templo Neſroch Deum ſuum: Adramelech, & Saraſer filij eius, percuſserunt eum gladio. &c. The ſeruauntes of King Ezechia came vnto Eſay. And Eſay ſaid vnto them. Thus ſhal ye ſay vnto your Lord. Thus ſayth the Lorde. Be not thou afraide of the wordes that ye haue hearde, wherewith the ſeruauntes

of the King of the Aſſirians haue blaſphemed me. Behold I wil put a ſpirit into him, and he ſhal heare a tidings, and he ſhal returne into his owne country, and in his owne countrye will I ouerthrowe him with the ſworde. And in the end of the ſame Chapter it is written thus. And when he was in the Temple worſhipping Neſroch his owne God: Adramelech and Saraſer hys owne ſonnes ſlewe him with the ſworde. &c.
               Furthermore, in the .xlv. of Geneſis, we reade thus, Geneſ. 45. 
                  Praemiſit
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      me Deus, vt reſeruemini ſuper terram, & eſcas ad viuē
                     dum habere poſsitis. Non vestro conſilio, ſed Dei voluntate miſsus ſum: qui fecit me quaſi patrem Pharaonis, & Dominum vniuerſae domus eius. &c. God ſent me before, that you might be reſerued vpon the earth, and haue foode to lyue by. It was not by your aduiſe or counſel, that I was ſent hither, but by the will of God, who hath made me to be as a Father vnto Pharao, and Lorde of all his houſe. &c.
               To conclude, in the laſt chapter of the ſame booke, we reade the matter repeated after this ſort. Nolite timere, num Dei poſsumus reſistere voluntati? Vos cogitastis de me malum: ſed Deus vertit illud in bonum. &c. Feare not, are we able to reſiſt Gods will? you did deuiſe euill for me: but God did turne it to good.
               By theſe Scriptures it appeareth plainelye, that all thoſe thinges that Herode, Pilate, and the Iewes did to Chriſt: that Pharao did in the hardneſſe of his heart: that the ſonnes of Sinacharib did to their Father: and that Ioſephes brethren did vnto him: were all done by the determinate purpoſe and Predeſtination of God. Whervpon, it ſemeth to me, that we may conclude that all other actions are done according to the ſame purpoſe and predeſtination. Otherwiſe, we muſt nedes confeſſe, that God is either diſapointed of his purpoſe oftentimes, or elſe that he createth many things, not knowing before

what ſhall become of them. Which obſurdities may in no caſe be graunted.
               Now what thoſe Scriptures be, wherewith Cerberus would haue theſe and ſuch like ſcriptures to be weyghed, we muſt geſſe: for Cerberus citeth not ſo muche as one, I will therefore geſſe as nere as I can▪ what ſcriptures thoſe be that he meaneth of. One as I ſuppoſe, is written by Sainct Paule to Timothe. The woordes are theſe. Deus vult omnes homines ſaluos fieri, & ad agnitionem veritatis 
                  1. Tim. 2. 
                  venire. God would haue al men ſaued & come to the acknowledging of the truth. Let vs firſt weigh this place with the other afore cited, and ſee how this maye make the other to ſerue nothing to y• purpoſe that we alleage them for. God would haue all men ſaued, and to come to the acknowledging of the truth: But if he did foreappoynt Herode, Pilate, and the Iewes, to accuſe and condemne his ſonne Chriſt, and did harden Pharaos heart, kyll Sinacharib with the ſword of his ſonnes, and ſende Ioſeph into Egypt by the trecherye of his brethren: he would not haue all men ſaued: for the rewarde of theſe workes is damnation: therfore God neuer appointed anye of theſe things to be done. I am ſure Cerberus can not applye this place better to his purpoſe, than it is in this argument applied. Now let vs ſée what may be ſaid to the contrarye, without eyther denying or wreſting of S. Paules wordes. Firſt, S. Auſten doth interprete theſe wordes of S. Paule after this ſort. Libro de voluntate Dei, Cap. 2. Occurrit enim, cùr pereant ex hijs aliqui, quum omnipotens Deus, omnes homines ſaluos fieri velit, & in agnitionem veritatis venire. Deinde, cur rursùs induret alios, miſertus aliorū, aùt quomodò omnes ſaluos fieri velit homines, quum ipſe nonnullos, nè ſaluentur induret? Hoc quantum ad humanam iustitiam videtur iniuſtum: ſed quis ità deſipiat, vel potiùs quis ità blaſphemet, vt dicat de iustitia Dei, lege humanae iustitiae diſputandum? Quae

Sapientia huius mundi, ſtulititia est apud Deum. Non est ergo de illa maiestate diuinae ſapientiae, humanae vanitatis arbitrio diſputandū. That is to ſay. For this is obiected. Why ſhould any of theſe periſhe, ſeing that God that is almightye, is willing that all men ſhould be ſaued, & come to the acknowledging of the truth? Moreouer, why doth he on the contrary part, harden ſome, taking mercy on other ſome: or howe is he willing that all men ſhoulde be ſaued, when he himſelfe doth harden ſome, leaſt they ſhould be ſaued? As touching humaine iuſtice, this thing ſéemeth vniuſt. But who would be ſo fooliſhe, or rather who woulde ſo blaſpheme: as to ſay, that we ſhould reaſon of y• iuſtice of God, by the order of y• iuſtice of man? which no doubt, if it be againſt the iuſtice of God, it is vniuſt. For it is manifeſt, that whatſoeuer hath in it anye iuſtice at all, doeth ſpring from him that is iuſt in the higheſt degrée. Who ſhall it be therfore, that will weigh by the arbitriment of mans wiſdome, the wiſedome of God, which remaineth immutable, and hath made, doeth gouerne and preſerue al things that be? Of which wiſdome, the ſame Apoſtle ſaith. That the wiſdome of the fleſhe, is enimie vnto God. And in another place. The wiſedome of the world is fooliſhneſſe with God.

Si natura, quare non omnibus: cum ſit idem Deus omniū creator? Si dono Dei, etiam hoc, quare non omnibus, cum omnes homines velit ſaluos ſieri, & ad agnitionem veritatis venire? Prius igitur illud dicamus & videamus, vtrū huic ſatis faciat quaestioni, quod liberum arbitrium naturaliter attributum à creatore animae rationali: illa media vis est, quae vel intendi ad fidem, vel inclinari ad inſidelitatem potest. Et ideò, nec istam voluntatem, qua credit Deo, dici potest homo habere, quam nòn acceperit, Quandoquidem vocante Deo, ſurgit de libero arbitrio, quod naturaliter cum crearetur, accepit. Vult enim Deus ōnes homines ſaluos fieri, & in agnitionem veritatis venire. Nòn ſic tamen, vt eis adimat liberū arbitrium, quo vel benè vel malè vterites, iustiſsime iudicentur. Quod cum fit, infideles quidem contra voluntatem Dei faciunt, cum eius Euangelio nòn credunt: nec ideò tamen eam vincunt, verùm ſcipſos fraudant magno & ſummo bono, malis
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      poenalibus implicant, experturi in ſupplicijs potestatem eius, cuius in donis miſericordiam contempſerunt. Ita voluntas Dei ſemper inuicta est. Vinceretur autèm, ſi nòn inueniret, quod de contemptoribus faceret: aut vllo modo poſsent euadere, quod de talibus ille constituit. That is. If we do beleue, to the end that we may obtaine this grace, and do alſo by the conſent of our will, beleue: hereof a queſtion is moued, whence we haue this wil. If it be of nature, why is it not in al mē: ſeing one God is the creator of all men? If we haue it by the gift of God, why is it not giuen to all men: ſeing he is willing that all men ſhould be ſaued, and come to the acknowledging of the truth? Let vs therfore affirme the firſt, and ſée whether it may ſatiſfie this queſtion, bicauſe fréewill, whiche the Creator hath naturally giuē to the reaſonable ſoule: is that indifferent power, which may eyther be bowed to faith, or inclined to infidelitie. And therfore, it can not be ſaid, that man hath not receyued this wil, whereby he beleueth in God, bicauſe, whē God calleth, it riſeth of fréewill, which he receiued when he was naturallye created.

For God is willing that all men ſhoulde be ſaued, and come to the knowledge of the truth: and yet not ſo, that he would take from them fréewill, whereby they may be iuſtly iudged, whē they vſe it wel or otherwiſe. In which doing, the Infidels do worke contrary to Gods will, bycauſe they beleue not his Goſpell. And yet doe they not therfore ouercome it, but they do defraude them ſelues of the great and moſt excellent goodneſſe, and do entangle them ſelues with euilles, wherewith they are puniſhed, and ſhal in the puniſhments haue experſēce of his power, whoſe mercye they did in his giftes contemne. So is the will of God alwayes vnconquered. But if he coulde not finde howe to vſe theſe deſpiſers, or if they could by anye meanes eſcape that which he hath appointed to become of ſuch: then ſhould his will be ouercome in dede.
               Againe, in his booke entituled Enchiridion ad Laurentiū. Capite. 103. he ſayeth thus. Ac per hoc, cum audimus, & in ſacris litteris legimus, quod velit omnes homines ſaluos furi: quamo uis certum ſit nobis, nòn omnes homines ſaluos ſicri, nòn tamen ideò debemus omnipotentiſsimae Dei voluntati aliquid derogare, ſed ità intellegere quod ſcriptum est: qui vult omnes homines ſaluos ficri: tanquam diceretur, nullum hominem fieri ſaluum, niſi quem ſaluum fieri ipſe voluerit: nòn quod nullus ſit hominum, niſi quem ſalitum ſicri velit, ſed quod nullus ſiat, niſi quem velit, & ideò ſit rogādus vt velit, quia neceſse est ſuri ſi voluerit. De orando quippè Deo agebat Apostolus vt hoc diceret. Sic enim intelligimus id quodin Euangelio ſcriptum est: Qui illuminat omnem hominem: nòn quia nullus est hominum qui non illuminetur, ſed quia niſi ab ipſo nullus illuminator. Aut certè ſic dictum est. Qui omnes homines vult ſaluos fieri, nòn quod nullus hominum eſset, quem ſaluum ſicri nollet, qui virtutes miraculorum facere noluit apud cos, quos dicit actitros fuiſse poenitentiam, ſi faciſset: ſed vt omnes homines omne genus hominum intelligamus per quaſcun
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      differentias distributum, Reges, priuatos, nobiles, ignobiles. &c.
               
               
                  
That is to ſay. And hereby when we heare and reade in the holy ſcriptures, that he is willing yt all men ſhould be ſaued, although we knowe aſſuredly that all men are not ſaued? yet may we not therefore derogate any thing from the almightye will of God, but vnderſtande that which is written, on this ſort. Not that there is no man, but that he woulde the ſame ſhoulde be ſaued; but that none cā be ſaued, but ſuch as he wil haue ſaued. And that therfore he ought to be prayed vnto, that he woulde be willing, bicauſe it muſt nedes be, if he be willing that it ſhould be. For when the Apoſtle ſpake theſe wordes, he was in hande with the prayers that are to be made vnto God. And after the ſame maner we vnderſtād that which is wrytten in the Goſpell. Whiche lightneth euerye man. Not that there is no man that is not illumined, or lightned: but for that there is none illumined, otherwiſe than of him. Or els vndoubtedly the wordes haue thys meaning. Which is willing that all mē ſhould be ſaued, not that there ſhoulde be no man whome he would not haue ſaued, which would not worke his miracles among them that he ſaith would haue repēted, if he had done ſo: but that we ſhould vnderſtand by all men, all ſortes of men, by what differences ſo euer the ſame be ſeuered, Kings, priuate perſons, noble perſons, and ignoble. &c.
               And againe in his booke. De correptione & gratia. Cap. 14. S. Auſten ſayth thus. Cum autèm homines per correptionem in viam iustitiae ſeu veniunt, ſeu reuertuntur, quis operatur in cordibus eorū ſalutē, niſi ille, qui quolibet plantante at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      rigante, & quolibet in agris at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      arbustulis operante, dat incrementum Deus, cui volenti ſaluum facere, nullum hominum reſistit arbitrium? Sic enim, velle vel nolle, in volentis aut nolentis est potestate, vt diuinam voluntatem nòn impediat, nec ſuperet potestatem. De hijs enim qui faciunt quae non vult, facit ipſe quae vult. Et quod ſcriptum eſt, quod vult omnes homines ſaluos fieri, nèc tamèn omnes

ſalui ſiunt: multis quidèm modis intelligi poteſt, ex quibus in alijs opuſculis nostris, aliquos commemorauimus, ſed hic vnum dicam. Ita dictum est. Omnes homines vult ſaluos ſicri, vt intelligantur omnes praedestinati, quia omne genus hominum in eis eſt, ſicut dictum eſt Phariſaeis. Decimatis omne olus, vbi nòn eſt intelligendum, niſi omne quod habebant. Ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      enim omne olus quod erat in toto terrarum orbe decimabant.
               
               That is to ſay. When men doe by chaſtiſement, eyther come or returne into the way of righteouſneſſe, who is it that worketh health in their hearts, but he who giueth the encreaſe, whē any man planteth or watreth, and when any man worketh in the fieldes or orchards, which is God, againſt whome, being willing to ſaue, no mans frée will doth make reſiſtāce. For to be willing or vnwilling, is after ſuch ſort in the power of him that is willing or vnwilling, that it be not a let to the will of God, nor do ouercome his power. For of them that do thoſe things that he willeth not, both he make thoſe things that he is willing to make. And where as it is written: that he is willing that all men ſhould be ſaued, and yet all be not ſaued: it may be vnderſtanded many wayes, whereof we haue in our other little workes made mention of ſome, but I wil now ſpeake of one moe. This is the ſaying. He is willing that all men ſhoulde be ſaued, that therby, all that be predeſtinated might be vnderſtande, for that among them are men of all ſortes. As it was ſayd to the Phariſeis, ye doe pay the tenth of euerye garden hearbe. Where we may not vnderſtande, 
                     •
                  oe than all that they had. For they did not giue the tenth of al the hearbes that be in the whole circle of the earth.
               By theſe places of S. Auſten may Cerberus ſée, how this place of ſcripture (God is willing that al men ſhould be ſaued. &c.) being wayed with the places that we builde vpon, doth make that they ſerue nothing to our purpoſe.

For in expounding of theſe wordes of S. Paule, God is willing that al men ſhould be ſaued & come to the knowledge of the truth: S. Auſten doth affirme as much as we do, as may wel appeare to as many as will way theſe places of his, with indifferent iudgement.
               One other place for this purpoſe, is written in the. 33. Chapter of Ezechiell. The words are theſe. Viuo ego dicit Dominus. Nolo mortem impij, ſed vt conuertatur impius à via ſua, & viuat. Conuertimini, conuertimini, à vijs vestris peſsimis, & quarè moriemini domus Iſrael? That is to ſay. As truely as I liue, ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of the vngodly, but that the vngodly be conuerted frō hys owne way and liue. Be conuerted, be conuerted frō your moſt wicked wayes, why will ye die, O you houſe of Iſrael?
               Saint Hierome expounding this place, beginneth at Super. Ezech. Cap. 33. theſe wordes in the ſame Chapter. Tu ergo fili hominis, dic ad domum Iſrael: ſic locuti estis dicentes. Iniquitates nostrae & peccata nostra ſuper nos. &c. Therefore thou ſonne of man, ſpeake thou to the houſe of Iſraell and ſay: thus haue ye ſpoken, ſaying: Our iniquities & ſinnes are vpon vs. &c. By occaſion of which wordes, S. Hierome ſayeth thus. Sinegligenter legamus, videtur nobis eadem prophetia eſse quae ſupra, in qua dicitur. Nunquid volens cupio mortem iniqui dicit dominus: niſi conuerti eum à via ſua mala & viuere? Et in fine eiuſdem propheti
                        •
                     e. Conuertimini & redite ab vniuerſis impietatibus vestris, & non erunt vobis in tormentum iniquitates. Ibi enim ad eos ſermo fit qui volunt agere poenitentiam, & iustitia peccata delere, vt cum fiducia conuertantur, & pleno animo agant poenitētiam. Hic autèm ad eos loquitur, qui magnitudine peccatorum, imo impietatum ſuarum deſperant ſalutem & dicunt: Iniquitates nostrae & peccata nostra ſuper nos ſunt, & in ipſis tabeſcimus, quomodo ergo viuere poterinites? Et est ſenſus. Cum ſemel nobis mors propoſita ſit: & vulneribus nostris nulla medicina poſsitreſtituere ſanitatem: quid neceſse eſt laborare & fruſtra conſumi, &

praeſentem vitam nòn cum desperatione tranſigere, vt ſaltèm hac fruamur: quia futuram perdidimus? Quibus respondet Deus, nòn velle ſe mortem impij, ſed vt reuertatur & viuat. Et Apostropham ſacit ad impios deſperātes: cōuertimini à vijs veſtris peſsimis. At
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      vt ſciamus, qui ſint impij ad quos loquitur, ſequēs ſermo demōstrat, Quarè moriemini domus Iſrael? Vita autem & mors in hoc loco nòn haec ſignificatur, qua omnes communi cum bestijs, lege naturae, vel viuimus, vel morte diſsoluimur: ſed illa de qua ſcriptum est. Placebo Domino in regione viuentium.
               
               That is to ſaye. If we reade this negligently, it ſéemeth to be the ſame prophecie, that is before, wherin it is ſaid, do I willingly deſire the death of the vngodly, ſayth the Lorde: or, but that he be conuerted from his owne euill waye and liue? And in the ende of the ſame Prophecie: Be ye conuerted and come backe againe from all your vngodlineſſes, and your iniquities ſhall not turne you to tormentes. For in that place he ſpeaketh vnto thoſe which are willing to repent, and by righteous life, to blot out their ſinnes, that they might with ſure confidence returne vnto God, and with full mindes repent. But in this place he ſpeaketh vnto thē, that throughe the greatneſſe of their owne ſinnes (yea their owne impieties) do diſpayre of ſaluatiō, and ſay. Our iniquities and our ſinnes are vppon vs, and in them doe we conſume away: how can we therefore liue? And this is their meaning. Seing that death is once ſet before vs, and no medicine is able to heale our woūds: what nede we labour and be conſumed, and not paſſe ouer thys life with deſperatiō: ſo, that at the leaſt way we may enioy this life? For the life to come we haue already loſt. Unto whome God maketh aunſwere, that he willeth not the death of the vngodly: but that he be conuerted & liue. And he turneth his ſpeach to the deſperate vngodlye ones: ſaying, turne you from your owne wayes, whiche are moſt wycked.

And that we might knowe who thoſe wicked ones were to whome he ſpake, the wordes that follow do declare. O ye houſe of Iſraell, why wyll ye dye? And that life and that death, wherby we do by the order of nature, with the brute beaſtes eyther liue or die, is not in this place ſignified: but that life whereof it is written. I will pleaſe the Lorde in the land of the liuing.
               By theſe wordes of S. Hierome: it appeareth, that he vnderſtoode not the wordes of Ezechiell, in ſuch ſorte as Cerberus would haue vs to vnderſtande them, that is, that by them is taught a doctrine contrarie to that which we teache, and ſo conſequently, the places that we builde vpon, proued to make nothing for our purpoſe. For Hierome ſaith, that in the .xviii. Chapter of his Prophecie, Ezechiell ſpeaketh to them that be penitent, and woulde by righteous life blot out their ſinnes paſt. Theſe doth he there encourage, with bolde courage and aſſured hope of forgiueneſſe at Gods hand, to go forward with their repentance begon, ſaying: Be ye conuerted, and returne againe from all your vngodlineſſes, and your iniquities ſhall not turne you to torment. But in this place, in the 33. of his Prophecie (ſayth S. Hierom) the Prophete ſpeaketh to the deſperate people of y• Iewes, which ſaid: Our iniquities and ſinnes are vpon vs. &c. Giuing them ſelues to continue in wickedneſſe, as thoſe that diſpayred of forgiueneſſe of that which was paſte, although they ſhould frō thenceforth endeuour amendment. To theſe (ſayth the Prophet) ſpeaketh God, ſaying: Turne from your owne moſte wicked wayes. Why wil ye die, O ye houſe of Iſraell? The greatneſſe of our ſinnes can be no cauſe why we ſhould diſpaire of Gods mercy. Wherefore we teache with Ezechiel, Ieremie, Eſaie, and the reſt of the holye Prophetes, that God is ready to receiue to mercy as many as by repentance and amendmēt of life turne to him,

beleuing the promiſe that he hath made in the death and bloudſhedding of his only ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. I conclude therefore that this place maketh for our purpoſe, and not againſt vs. And leaſt I ſhoulde trouble the Reader ouer much, with ſuch places as this: I 
                     〈◊〉
                   referre all ſuch places to the aunſwere I haue here made, not doubting but the diligent Reader, who ſeketh nothing but the ſimple trueth, ſhalbe therewithall ſatiſfied.
               Nowe, as touching the places of S. Auſten, whyche Cerberus citeth out of his boke: De eſsētia Diuinitatis: And De libero arbitrio & gratia: I will firſt rehearſe all the wordes that S. Auſten wryteth in thoſe places, concerning this matter, and then weigh them, that we may ſée how they may ſerue for Cerberus purpoſe. The wordes are theſe. Indurare dicitur Deus quorundam malorum corda, ſicùt de Pharaone Rege Egypti ſcriptū est: nòn 
                        〈◊〉
                      omnipotens Deus, ppotentiā
                   
                  Augusti. De eſsentia Diuinitatis. 
                  ſuā corda corum induret, quod eſt impiū ità credere: ſed exegē
                     tibus corū culpis, quam duritiā cordis, quā ipſi ſibi mala perpetrando nutriūt, nòn auſert: quaſi ipſe cos induret, quià iuſto iudicio indurari ſinit. That is to ſay: It is ſaid that God doth hardē the heartes of certaine euill men, as it is written of Pharao King of Egypt: not that the Almightye God doeth by his almightie power harden their hearts, which thing to beleue, is an vngodly thing: but when theyr faultes requiring the ſame, doeth not take from them that hardneſſe, which in committing euilles, they themſelues doe nouriſhe to themſelues: he doth as it were himſelfe harden them, bicauſe he doth, by his iuſt iudgemēt, ſuffer thē to be hardened.
               If Cerberus woulde haue weighed theſe words wel: he woulde neuer haue applyed them againſt vs. For we teach not, that the almighty God, doth by his almightie power harden mens hearts, for we know that it were an vngodly thing ſo to teach or beleue: but we teache as S.

Auſten doth, that theyr ſinnes requiring the ſame, he leaueth them in the hardneſſe of their hearts, which by committing of euilles, they do nouriſh vnto themſelues. For by the ſinne of the firſt man al mens hearts are hardned, and of them ſelues they can do nought elſe but nouryſhe that hardneſſe, and Gods hardning of their hearts, is nothing elſe but the withholding of the deawe of his grace from them, without which they can not be ſoftned. And this he doth in iuſt iudgement, for the ſinne of oure firſt Father hath deſerued no leſſe in vs all. But here I muſt let the Reader vnderſtande, what places Cerberus pycketh for his purpoſe. Eraſmus ſuppoſeth, that rather Hugo Victorinus than S. Auſten ſhould be y• Autor of this booke. Well, I will not ſtriue wyth him for the matter. But let him conſider it better before he applie it againſt vs againe.
               The woordes of the other place that Cerberus citeth out of the .xxj. chapter of S. Auſtens booke. De gratia & libero arbitrio: are as faithfully handled as y• other. Cerberus 
                  August. De gratia & libero arbitrio. Cap. 21. feared to ſet downe to many of Auſtens wordes, leaſt the Reader ſhoulde ſee that they make with vs againſt Cerberus and his fellowes. I will therfore ſet downe ſo many of hys wordes as may make his meaning knowen to the diligent Reader. Firſte, in the beginning of the ſame Chapter, he ſayth thus. Quis nòn ista iudicia diuina contremiſcat, quibus agit Deus in cordibus etiàm malorum hominum quicquid vult, reddens eis tamèn ſecundum merita eorum? Roboam filius Salomonis reſpuit conſiliū ſalubre Seniorum quod ei dederant. &c. Who would not (ſaith Auſten) tremble at theſe iudgementes of God, wherby he doth in the heartes euen of wicked men, worke what he luſteth, and yet rendring vnto them according to their deſeruings. Roboam, the ſonne of Salomon, refuſed the holeſome counſell of the Elders which they gaue him, which was that he ſhould

not deale roughly with the people, and he hearkened rather to the wordes of them that were of his owne age, giuing a rough aunſwere to them, whom he ſhould haue aunſwered gentlye. And ſo forth, citing many examples out of the Scriptures, to proue, that God is he, that worketh in the hearts of euill men, thoſe things wherby his purpoſe is performed in puniſhing of ſinne.
               And towards the end of the Chapter, he ſaith: Hijs & talibus testimonijs diuinorum eloquiorum, quae omnia comemorare

Inſipientia viri, violat vias eius: Deum autèm cauſatur in corde ſuo. That is to ſay. By theſe and ſuche like teſtimonies of holy Scriptures, wherof it were too long to make a whole recitall, it is, as I ſuppoſe, ſufficientlye ſhewed, that God doeth woorke in the heartes of men, to encline their willes whither it pleaſeth him, whether it be to good things, according to his mercie, eyther to euill things, according to their merits, and according to his own iudgement, which is ſometime open, and ſometime ſecrete, but alwayes iuſte. For this perſuaſion ought to be fired and vnmoueable in your hearts: that there is none iniquitie with God. And hereby, when ye reade in the writings of the truth, that God doth leade mē out of the way, or that he doth dull or harden their heartes: do ye not doubt, but that their euill deſeruing went before, that they might iuſtly ſuffer theſe things, leaſt ye ſhould runne into that

Prouerbe of Salomon, which ſayth. The fooliſhneſſe of a man doth defile his wayes: but in his heart he layeth the blame in God.
               If Cerberus would haue ſet downe all theſe wordes of S. Auſten: I ſhoulde not haue neded to write any aū
                  ſwere to that whiche he did ſet downe. For S. Auſtens wordes are ſufficient for aunſwere, when he ſayth that God worketh in the hearts of mē to encline their willes, whether it be to good things, according to his mercy, or to euill things, according to their deſeruings, & that which way he him ſelf is willing to encline them. Now let Cerberus finde contradiction in S. Auſtens words, if he can. As forme, I can ſée none. But if Cerberus can finde none, then hath he applied S. Auſtens wordes againſt vs, contrary to S. Auſtens meaning.
               Nowe let vs ſée what Cerberus hath founde in Melancthons common places. Melancthon ſpeaketh verye plainly (ſaith Cerberus) and ſayth, Nec figur
                        •
                      illae verborum offendunt. &c. Neither ſaith he, doe theſe figuratiue ſpeaches offend. As I wil hardē the heart of Pharao, and ſuch like: for it is certain, that in the Hebrew phraſe, they ſignifie a permiſſion or ſuffering, & not an effectuall will of God. As leade vs not into temptation, y• is to ſaye, ſuffer vs not to be lead into temptatiō. Theſe are Melancthons wordes, ſayth Cerberus: and marke (ſayth he) what he ſayeth of the Hebrew phraſe, for all men know him to be a man learned. Here Cerberus beginneth to triumphe, and ſemeth to himſelfe to haue wonne the ſtelde. Melancthon hath ſaid it, therfore it muſt nedes be ſo. I reuerence Melancthon, and do acknowledge that he was learned: but let vs ſée whether, in this point, Melācthon haue not ſhewed him ſelfe to loth to offende ſuch as Cerberus is, and therfore ſéemed to haue giuen them vaūtage againſt himſelfe. In the ſame booke of common places, in the firſt

title, which is De Deo: he deſcribeth God after this ſorte: Deut est eſsentia ſpiritualis, intelligens, aterna, verax, bona, pura, iusta, miſericors, liberrima, immenſaepotenti
                        •
                     e & ſapientiae. &c. That is to ſaye: God is a ſpirituall eſſence, vnderſtanding, euerlaſting, true, good, pure, iuſte, mercifull, moſte frée, & of vnmeaſurable power and wiſdome. &c. Nowe, if God do permit any thing to be done which he is not willing ſhould be done, how is he almightye? Other therefore, as learned as Melancthon, haue ſayd, & in my iudgement, truly: that to permit and to will is alone, in him that can not be enforced to permit or ſuffer that which he is not willing ſhould be. But as I haue declared before, we affirme not, that the actions, wordes, and thoughtes of man, as they are willed or permitted by God, are or can be ſinne. For he being altogether good, and nothing elſe but goodneſſe; can not will or permit anye thing that is euill. The euill therefore that is in mens thoughtes, wordes or actions, commeth of the Deuil and mens own willes: which God doth will or permit, as a meane, eyther to ſet forth his mercie in forgiuing, or his iuſtice in puniſhing, whiche in that reſpect can not be other than good. What Cerberus hath wonne by citing theſe words of Melancthon: let y• learned that haue read other mens writings vppon this matter, iudge. I haue ſayde that I thinke to be true.
               But now Cerberus thinketh to paye vs home. To be ſhorte, ſayeth he, it is ſurelye to be maruelled at, that althoughe they doe thus accuſe Gods Predeſtination to be the onely cauſe of Adams ſall (which is in dede not onely ſinne, but alſo the very welſpring of all wickedneſſe, and the ſilthy fountaine of all our vncleanneſſe) that yet they dare affirme themſelues to be the onely friendes and louers of Gods Predeſtination. &c. Cerberus will be ſhorte now. Well let him be aunſwered as ſhortly. He hath all

this while laboured to proue that was neuer denied, that is, that the ſinne of Adam in his firſt fall, is the cauſe of al the ſinne that hath bene, is, or ſhalbe committed by his poſterity. For we hold, that after Adam had once ſinned, neyther he nor anye of hys poſteritie, being naturallye brought forth in this worlde, could of them ſelues do any other thing than ſinne. The cauſe wherof we ſay, is that concupiſcence and luſt to do euil, which entred into him, & from him is deſcended into his poſteritie. But what is this to the cauſe of Adams fall. Thys concupiſcence was not in Adam before his fall. It could not therefore be the cauſe therof. And as I haue declared before: Adams fall coulde not be the cauſe of all ſinne: for ſinne was before Adam fell. We knowe that ſinne is not a creature: but it is a falling away of the creature from that order that the Creator did commaunde the creature to continue in. But this was in y• Aungels, Ergo before the fall of mā. By y• fall of man therfore was declared what mans fréewill was able to do. It was able to admit ſinne, and ſo by freewill ſinne entred into man, and by man into the world, that is into all naturall men. And yet we ſay not, that either mans freewill or man himſelfe is euill, as he is Gods creature, and fréewill Gods gifte. I conclude therfore, that as the fall of Adam was the performance of Gods purpoſe, ſo was it no ſinne, but excéeding good, as euery performance of Gods purpoſes muſte néedes be. And ſo the Predeſtination of God being the cauſe therof, is no cauſe of ſinne. Let Cerberus maruel as much as he will, how we can graunt God to be the cauſe and not the Autour of ſinne. For we do not ſay that Gods Predeſtination is the cauſe of ſinne. Much leſſe doe we ſay that he is the Autour, as Cerberus doth charge vs by occaſiō of certayne wordes written by Iohn Knoxe againſt an aduerſarie of Gods Predeſtination.
               
                  
Although Iohn Knoxe being yet liuing, & able to defend his owne writings, I might refer Cerberus to his aunſwere: yet I wil not ſticke to write a few lines in the defence of his doctrine in this point. Cerberus ſéemeth to miſlike with Knoxe for two things: one is, for that he ſaith that we aſſigne to the prouidence of God, all things that the Ethnickes and Ignoraunt attributed vnto fortune. And the other is, for that hée ſayth that we know and beholde God to be, not onelye the principall cauſe, but alſo the authour of all things, appointing them to the one parte or ſo the other by hys counſell. Thys is (ſayth Cerberus) ſuche a wyde wandring blaſphemie, as hath not lightly bene hearde of. And although Cerberus would haue vs marke the wordes, & the very ſenſe of thē, as though he would ſet forth the ſame ſo plainely, that al men might eaſely perceyue the meaning of thē: yet with his leaue, he ſheweth that he himſelfe did not ſée that he would haue other to marke. For what mad man woulde write words in ſuch meaning, as Cerberus would haue vs thinke that Iohn Knoxe wrate his? That is, to call God deceyiſull, vnfaythful, and vntruſty? Rough, hard, ſierce and cruel? Bawdy, beaſtly, and ſhameleſſe? Imperious, malapert, and proude? Blinde, and wythout eyes? Wicked, to be abhorred, and altogether naught? Was there euer man ſo farre beſide himſelf, as to wryte of God in this meaning? I durſt appeale to Cerberus himſelfe (though he be the dogge of Hell) whyther in conſcience he doe thinke that it were poſſible that any reaſonable man may ſo far forget him ſelfe, as to write words in any ſuch meaning. Let Cerberus therfore, loke better vpō 
                  Iohn Knoxe words, and ſeke a better ſenſe in them than this. If he wil do ſo, he ſhall finde that Iohn Knoxe meaning is, that where as the Ethnickes and Ignorant attributed vnto fortune, a power to giue or take away,

to preſerue or deſtroy, to helpe or to hinder. We which know y• there is no ſuch power in any other thā in God, do aſſigne all theſe things to his prouidence: knowing y• nothing commeth to paſſe by Fortune or chaūce, but that God by his prouidence doth gouerne and rule all things, appoynting them to the one parte, or the other, by hys counſell. And when he appointeth anye to that thing which in them is ſinne (as was the murder of Sinacharib in his owne ſonnes) yet in Gods purpoſe it is good, for it is the execution of his iuſt iudgement, or the meane whereby his glorie ſhal be the more aduaunced in ſhewing mercie. If Cerberus be not certified with this aunſwere, let him ſeke for further aunſwere at the hands of him whoſe writings he hath ſo maliciouſly peruerted.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               But now to returne againe to Crowley. After that he hath written, that Gods predeſtination is the onlie cauſe of Adams fall, then goeth he foorth in the ſame boke, and the ſame Article, vnto the next execrable wickedneſſe, committed in the world, ſaying: Now, what ſay we to Cain: was he not predeſtinated to ſlea his brother? No, ſaye the freewill men. Here thou ſeeſt dearly beloued, who they are that ſo odiouſlie are noted with the name of freewyll men. Not only the Papiſtes, againſt whom he pretendeth there to wryte: but namely all thoſe that ſaye, God hath not predeſtinate any man to cōmit murder, or ſuch like wycked abhomination. Theſe call they freewill men, theſe cal they Pelagians. In dede ſuch as ſo maintayn freewil, that a mā by freewyl wythout the grace and helpe of God, may abſtayne from euill, or do good, as the blinde Papiſtes doe, and as before it

is proued, that Pelagius did holde, or as before is rehenrſed, that Willyam Samuell ſayth: that man maye deſerue God: thoſe I ſaye, might worthily be called Pelagians, bicauſe they hold, eyther al, or ſome part of hys errours. But thoſe which teach, that all murder and miſchieſe ſpryngeth out of Gods predeſtination, or that any manſleaer is predeſtinate of God to kyll hys neighboure, or any adulterer to lye with his neyghboures wyfe, or any traytour predeſtinate of God, to conſpire againſt hys Prince, or any rebell to ryſe againſt his Soueraigne, as theſe men moſt plainly aſſyrme: they holde in thys poynt the errour of the Manicheans, whych was as ye hearde before, by the wordes of Auſten. Hominem peccatum vitare nòn poſse. That a man can not eſchewe euill, or can not chooſe but commit ſinne. Theſe men, I ſay, whych affirme that Caine was predeſtinate to murder hys innocent brother Abell. And as in the ſame boke and the ſame Article alſo, he ſayth, that the moſt wicked perſons that haue bene, were of God appointed to bee wycked euen as they were. They hold the errour both of the Stoikes, and alſo of the Manicheans. That is to ſay, as Auſten declareth in the ninth & .xvi. chapter of the firſt boke of his Retractations: that euil hath his original of Gods ordinance, & not of mans freewil. For if murderers, theues, adulterers, traitours, & Rebelles be of God predeſtinated and appoynted to be wicked euē as they are, and can not chooſe but of mere neceſſitie by the ordinance of God commit, al ſuch wickedneſſe, euen as they do: then what is our lyfe but a mere deſtinie, all our doyngs Gods ordynaunces, and all oure imaginations, braunches of Gods predeſtinatiō? And I doubt not, but the Stoikes and Manicheans, would alſo temper the matter

wyth a great diſcretion of wordes, as theſe men wyll ſaye, that we muſt ſpeake more reuerentlie of the matter. But ſeyng they plainely holde theſe principles, and when they ſee theyr tyme, ſpeake plainely thereof them ſelues, as you maye well perceyue by that whych hath alredy, and ſhal yet be more largely rehearſed: I ſee no cauſe why it ſhould not of al mē be plainely declared. Agayne, if it be a trueth, why ſhould it not be plainly ſpoken, if it be a truth, that traitours be predeſtinate of God to conſpire the deſtructiō of their Princes, and Rebels predeſtinate of God to make inſurrectiō againſt their ſoueraines: If (I ſay) it be a trueth, that God hath ſo predeſtinated thē, & that they muſt of neceſſity, & can not chooſe but commit ſuch wyckedneſſe: why ſhoulde it not be plainly ſpoken? except a man ſhould be aſhamed to ſpeake the trueth. But in what Scripture is that written? Or is it not rather written. For thy lyfe, ſhame not to ſay the trueth. And ſurelye to ſay as Eccleſ. 4. it is: I ſee not well howe any man can ſpeake more plainely in thys matter than they them ſelues doe. For what can more plainly be ſpokē: thā that Gods predeſtination is the cauſe of Adams fall? And that Caine was predeſtinate to ſlea his brother? And that God is both the principal cauſe, and alſo the author of all thyngs, both on the one ſide and on the other, appoynting al things to al men. And whatſoeuer the Ethnickes aſcribed vnto fortune: that ſame we ought to attribute vnto the prouidence of God. And that the moſt wycked perſons that haue bene: were of God appointed to be wicked euen as they were.
            
            
               Crowley.
               
                  
Here it appeareth, that the chieſe quarrell that Cerberus had, when he wrate this aunſwere to his friendes letter, was againſt Crowley. If the ſpirit of loue had led him, he might haue had conference wt 
                  Crowley (for belike he knoweth him well ynough) & not thus maliciouſly by ſetting out his anſwere in print, haue gone about aſmuch as lieth in him, not only to diſcredit the doctrine yt 
                  Crowley preacheth: but alſo to bring him in diſpleaſure with his Prince, as one ye teacheth theues, murderers, traitors & rebells, & al other naughty perſons to defend their wickedneſſe by Gods predeſtination & ordinance. But Crowley ſhal by Gods helpe, be able to cleare him ſelfe of all this, & to make the malice of Cerberus ſo knowne to al men, that he ſhal from henceforth haue little credit amōg ſuch as doe not fauour the errour of our new Pelagians.
               For anſwere to al y• 
                  Cerberus hath in this his returne to Crowley, written, I might referre the Reader to that whiche I haue already written. But leaſt Cerberus ſhould thinke that that were but a ſhift, I will aunſwere to his Taùtologie, or repeticion of the ſame wordes and matter that is before written and anſwered, and chieſly bicauſe he doth here inferre more playnely that which before he meaneth to conclude.
               I haue ſaide, that Gods predeſtination was the onely cauſe of Adams fall, that Caine was predeſtinate to ſlea his brother Abell, and that the moſt wicked perſons that haue bene, were of God appointed to be wicked, euē as they were. For the firſt, I referre the Reader to that which I haue alreadie written thereof. For the ſeconde, I ſay: that as God predeſtinated Abell to be a figure of Chriſt and his Churche in ſuffering, ſo he predeſtinated Caine to be a figure of the cruell perſecuting Iewes & other, that haue, do, & ſhall perſecute Chriſt & his Church. And as Caine in ſleaing his brother Abell was a figure

of the cruell perſecutours, ſo was not the murder euill: but as it was the execution of Caines wicked will, it was abhominable ſinne, and deſerued no leſſe puniſhment at Gods hand, than it had in deede. And as concerning the power of Caines will, whereby he conſented to do this deede: it was altogether bound to the will of Sathan, by the ſinne that his Father Adam had firſt committed, & was not deliuered from that bondage, bicauſe he was none of them whome Ieſus Chriſt, the ſonne of God had deliuered and made frée: as doeth well appeare by that he ſayeth: My ſinne is greater than that it can be forgiuen. He had not receyued the ſpirite of Adoption, whereby he might cry Abba, Father. Wherefore, it is manifeſt, that whatſoeuer he did, was abhominable in Gods ſight, for he lacked fayth whereby mennes workes are made acceptable before God. For without it, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. As it is written. Sine fide impoſsibile 
                  Hebr. 11. 
                  eſt placere Deo. Without fayth, it is not poſſible to pleaſe GOD. And hereof it came, that is written Ad Cain enim & munera eius Deus nòn reſpexit. God had Geneſ. 4. no regarde to Caine and his oblations. For euen his verie oblations which he offered, were ſinne in the ſight of God, according to the wordes of Saint Paule. Quicquid ex 
                  Rom. 14. 
                  ſide nòn eſt, peccatum eſt. Whatſoeuer is not of faith, the ſame is ſinne. How can it be then, but that the murder of his brother muſt be ſinne, as it was the execution of his malicious purpoſe: but as it is the performance of Gods purpoſe, it can not be but good. The lyke is to be ſaide of the murder y• the ſonnes of Sinacharib committed vpon their own father, and the rebellion of Abſolom, 4. Reg. 19. 2. Reg. 16. the whoredome of the ſame, the thefte of the Sabines, and whatſoeuer wickedneſſe we reade of. For God had ſayde before, that he woulde ſlea Sinacharib with the ſworde, and that the ſworde ſhould not depart from Dauids

houſe. And Iob ſayde: The Lorde hath taken away. 2. Reg. 12. Iob. 1. In that Cerberus therefore, hath taken vpon him to write thus maliciouſlye againſte me and others that teach the true doctrine of Gods euerlaſting predeſtination: he is not by our doctrine iuſtified from ſinne therin, althoughe in the purpoſe of God the ſame be good (for it is the ſtirring vp of me and others, to loke more diligently to the teaching of that doctrine, in ſuche ſorte that the weake Chriſtians be not offended, neyther the enimies occaſioned to blaſpheme) but when Cerberus and we ſhall ſtand before the iudgement ſeat of Chriſt togither: then ſhall it appeare with what mynde wée haue both written. For his malice towards Crowley can not then be couered.
               And where as Cerberus woulde know, where it is written that all truth ſhould not be playnely ſpoken: let him aſke Sainct Paule why he would firſt féede his hearers with mylke, and afterwarde with ſtronger meate. And let him aſke our Sauiour Chriſt, why he ſayd that olde bottles coulde not holde new Wyne, and that therfore men vſe to put newe Wyne into new veſſelles that both maye be preſerued togither. And as for hys place that he citeth out of Sirache, (For thy lyfe ſhame not to ſay the truth) I reſer to the Reader to cōſider and weigh Eccleſ. 4. by the circumſtance of the place. Wherby it ſhal appeare how well it maketh for hys purpoſe. Sirach ſayth: For thy lyfe ſhame not to ſaye the trueth, for there is a ſhame that bringeth ſinne, & there is a ſinne that bringeth glory & fauour. Now, how can Cerberus proue by this place that a preacher muſt without diſcretion vtter all truth at all times & in al places? It is manifeſt that Sirach meaneth to inſtruct all men, that ſhame ſhould not ſtaye vs from confeſſing the trueth of our owne euyll, when we are deprehended therein: for that ſhame bringeth ſinne.

(That is, cauſeth vs to lie in hyding our owne faults before committed) but the other ſhame, that is, to doe that which is not honeſt, bringeth glorie and fauour. Shame therefore ſayth Sirach, to do euil: but for thy life, ſhame not to confeſſe the euyll that thou haſt once done, and art taken withal, or vehemently ſuſpected therof. But (ſayth Cerberus) how can any man ſpeake more plainly of this matter, than they thēſelues doe? For what can be more plainely ſpoken: than that Gods Predeſtination is the cauſe of Adams fall? And that Caine was predeſtinated to ſlea his brother? And that God is both the principall cauſe & alſo the Author of al things, both on the one ſyde and on the other. &c. Al this is ſufficiently aunſwered already. But y• cauſe, why in our writings we vſe ſo plaine wordes in this matter: is, for that we haue not to doe with babes that néede milk, but with open enimies, that vnder colour to cleare God of iniquitie, go about to take from him the glorie of his almighty power, and libertie, to do what he will do with his owne creatures, without checke or controlement: And to aſcribe to the power of their owne fréewil, that glory that the frée mercy of God deſerueth. We doe not this therefore in our common order of teaching, but being enforced by the malice of ſuch as Cerberus is.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               And furder, in the ſame boke and the ſame Article. Yea, I am ſure (ſayth he) that you will graunt, that if God doe predeſtinate a man to do things raſhly and without any deliberation: he ſhall not deliberate at all, but runne headlong vpon it, be it good or euyll that he doth. He maketh alſo an argument after this ſort, ſaying: Whatſoeuer God foreſeeth and prededeſtinateth:

muſt neceſſarily come to paſſe (for his preſcience and predeſtination are infallible) but he foreſeeth and predeſtinateth al things: Ergo al things muſt come to paſſe of neceſſitie. The minor of which Argument is apparantly falſe. For though God doe foreſee all things: yet doeth he not predeſtinate all things. For his foreſight doeth extende both to good and euill: but his predeſtination is onelye of things that be good. As the Scriptures and all auncient writers proue. And here againe it is to be noted alſo: how plainely they make God the Authour of ſinne. For if this maior be true, that God doth not onely foreſee, but alſo predeſtinate all things: Yea, euen ſinne and euill, as the fall of Adam, and the murder of Caine, and the wickedneſſe of all them that haue bene moſt wycked: then may this minor be truely annexed: That God is the Authour of al that he predeſtinateth. And ſo muſt this concluſion needes follow: that God is the Authour of all ſinne and euyll. The firſt parte, that God: predeſtinateth all thinges, or all that he ſoreſeeth: is a propoſition of their own aſſertiō, without any ambiguitie or doutfull meaning. The ſeconde part, that God is the Authour of al that he predeſtinateth, is mine aſſertion. Which is ſo manifeſt and true, that they haue ſcarce any maner of colour to deny it. For what is it to predeſtinate any thing? but firſt to purpoſe, decree, and appoint, and ordeine it to be done? Now, he which firſt purpoſeth, decreeth, appointeth, ordeineth, or inuēteth a thing to be done: is not he the Author of the ſame? Or is not he rightly to be called Cauſa, Origo, Fons: Radix, Principium, Autor? The Cauſe, Originall, Fountaine, Roote, Beginning or Authour of the ſame? He which firſt purpoſeth, decreeth, apointeth,

and ordeineth an Inſurrection or Rebellion to be made againſt his Prince: is not he to be apprehē
                  ded as the very Authour of al the ſedition, and worthily and rightly to be iudged and called? What mā can be ſo ignorant: as not to perceiue it? For all the worlde knoweth, that for none other cauſe, one is ſayde to be the Authour of any thing, but onely, for that he is eyther the firſt inuētor, or elſe the firſt purpoſer, appointer, & ordeiner of the ſame. And alſo, whoſoeuer is the firſt inuentor, or elſe the firſt ordeiner of any thing: moſt properly he is ſayd to be the Authour of the ſame. Nowe, marke againe the Argument, and ſee how the concluſion followeth. God predeſtinateth all things, yea, euen ſinne and euyll: And God is the Author of all that he predeſtinateth, as hath bene plainely proued: Ergo, he is the Authour of ſinne. This muſt needes follow, if the firſt propoſition be graunted. That God predeſtinateth or ordeineth al things, or al that he foreſeeth. Wherfore, the olde writers, in confutation of the Manicheans, laboured in nothing ſo much; as to proue, that although God did foreſee all things, both good and euyll: yet dyd he onely foreſee, and not predeſtinate thoſe things which are euill. As by an infinite number of places, out of the auncient writers, if ſhorteneſſe woulde ſuffer, I coulde eaſely proue. But one place of Auſten, I wil rehearſe, which doth not onely reſolue clearely this matter betwene foreſight and for cordinaunce: or betwene the preſcience and predeſtination: but alſo moſt plainely teacheth, al that is to be ſayde of predeſtination. Prosper. Ad obiectio. Vince. Rehearſing the words, and defending the opinion of Auſten, where he proueth that the Diuell can ſcarcely be called the Authour of ſinne, by cauſe

it came of mans owne will, and asketh by what madneſſe and frenſle men doe attribute that vnto God, which can not be altogether aſcribed vnto the Deuill. And at the laſt he concludeth with theſe words of Auſten.
               
                  Nihil ergo talium negotiorum Deus praedestinauit vt ſuret: nec illam animā nequitèr turpiter
                        
                           
                        
                        que

                      ita ad praedestinationem eius nihil aliudreſerri poiest, niſi quod aut ad debitam iustitiae retributionem, aut ad indebitam pertinet gratiae largitatem.
               
               Therefore (ſayth he) God hath predeſtinated no part of any ſuch doings, neither the ſoule, which afterwarde liued wickedly and filthily, hath he prepared to that ende that it ſhould ſo liue: but he was not ignorant that ſuch a one it woulde be. And ſo nothing may be referred to the praedeſtination of God: but onely that which pertayneth vnto the due recompēce of his righteouſneſſe, or to the vndeſerued gift of his grace. Theſe are the wordes of Auſten. which ſurely are maruellous ful of pith, conteyning the whole ſumme of that which may be ſayde in this matter of Gods predeſtinatiō, and are therfore moſt worthie to be noted, yea, and to be committed to heart, or kept in perpetual memorie. For being thorowely weyghed, they do plainely ſet forth, the full reſolution of all this queſtion.
            
            
               Crowley.
               
                  Cerberus is ſo maliciouſly bente agaynſt Crowley, that he can kepe no order in charging him with that that he hath written agaynſt Shaxton. For this (yea, I am ſure) wherwith he chargeth me here, ſtandeth in my boke

more than eyghte whole leaues after the Argument that he findeth ſuch fault with. Yea, it is parte of that which I doe inferre vpon the confeſſion of Shaxton himſelfe, in his Article that I confute, after I had by many Scriptures proued the minor propoſition of that Argument. But who can hope that Cerberus can with his thrée mouthes kepe order in his barking? Let me (if I can) aunſwere him in order, vnto that wherewith he doth ſo vnorderly charge me.
               Firſt he ſaith, that I ſay that I am ſure that Shaxton will graunt, that if God doe predeſtinate a man to doe things raſhly and without any deliberation, he ſhall not deliberate at al, but runne headlong vpon it, be it good or euyll that he doth. Nowe let vs ſee what Cerberus hath ſayde to this. He ſéemeth to make a great matter of it: For he beginneth thus: And furder. As though ye wherewith he wyll nowe charge Crowley, is more to be deteſted than the reſt that is already ſpoken of. And yet when he hath made rehearſall of the wordes: he ſéemeth by ſilence to allowe them. Wherefore, I will be bolde to ſay to Cerberus, as I dyd to Shaxton. I am ſure that you will graunt. &c.
               But as one that vnaduiſedly had gone about to finde fault with words that he was not able iuſtly to diſproue: Cerberus leaueth theſe wordes, and returneth to an Argument that I wrate well moſt nyne leaues before, and ſaith. He maketh alſo an Argumēt after this ſort, ſaying: Whatſoeuer God foreſéeth and predeſtinateth, muſt neceſſarily come to paſſe (for his preſciēce and predeſtination are infallible) but he foreſéeth & predeſtinateth al things. Ergo, all thinges muſte come to paſſe of neceſſitie. Here Cerberus hath found matter to brabble about. The maior propoſition of this Argument he findeth no fault withal. Wherefore I wyll ſuppoſe that he thinketh it to be true,

that whatſoeuer God foreſéeth and predeſtinateth, muſt neceſſarily come to paſſe. But by Cerberus owne confeſſion, God foreſéeth & predeſtinateth all good things. Ergo, all good thinges come to paſſe of neceſſitie. Thus much haue we gotten of Cerberus. So that if it be a Stoicall opinion, to ſay that al things come to paſſe of neceſſitie: yet Cerberus ſhall not be ſo cleare from it as he woulde ſéeme to be.
               But my minor propoſition muſt be apparantly falſe. For though God do foreſée al things, yet doth he predeſtinate only thoſe things which are good, as the ſcriptures & auncient writers doe proue. So that nowe there remayneth no more to be proued by me, but that God predeſtinateth thoſe things that be euyll. Which thing if I can proue: Cerberus and I are agréed.
               Well, If Cerberus would be entreated to beléeue all that I haue written in the former part of this Apologie: then ſhould the controuerſie betwixt vs, ſone be ended. For I haue ſayde, that euen thoſe things, that are worſt in mans doings, are good in Gods purpoſe. As the conſenting to the perſuaſion of the Serpent in the firſt man: the murder of Abel in Caine, & thoſe wyckedneſſes that others haue wrought: were in Gods purpoſe good, although in thoſe that did thoſe things, they were excéeding euyll. For then hath Cerberus graunted, that God doth predeſtinate them, and ſo conſequently he hath graunted that they come to paſſe of neceſſitie, as thoſe things that God predeſtinateth muſt néedes doe. But whether Cerberus wyll beléeue that which I haue written or no: I will by Gods help proue that thoſe actions which in man are moſt wicked, were predeſtinated by God to be done: And then I trowe mine Argument ſhal conclude aright, notwithſtanding ought that Cerberus ſhalbe able to ſay to the contrarie.
               
                  
And leaſt we ſhoulde varie aboute predeſtination, as not agreing vpon the definition what it is: I am contē
                  ted to take that deſcription which Cerberus hym ſelfe hath made of it. He ſayth, that to predeſtinate any thing, is firſt to purpoſe, decree, apoynt, or ordeyne it to be done. But God hath firſt decreed to be done all the euil things as euer were done by men: Ergo, he hath predeſtinated euils. The minor in this argument is proued by that that is written in the fourth Chapter of the Actes of the Apoſtles. Conuenerunt enim in Ciuitate ista, aduerſus filium tuum Ieſum, quem vnxisti, Herodes & Pòntius Pilatus, cum gentibus & populis Iſrael: ad faciendum quaecunque manus tua & conſiliū tuum decreuerunt fieri. That is to ſay. In this ſame Citie (meaning Ieruſalem) Herode and Pontius Pilate, with the Heathen and the people of Iſraell, gathered themſelues together, agaynſt thy childe Ieſus whome thou haſt annoynted: to doe vnto him whatſoeuer things thy hand and counſell haue firſt decréed to be done. What thoſe things were, it is manifeſt in the hyſtorie of the Goſpels. They called him a Samaritane, they ſayd he had a diuel, they ſought to take him in his aunſweres, they went about to ſtone him to death, they accuſed him, they condē
                  ned him, and faſtened him to a Croſſe, & then rayled vpon him. What could men do worſſe than to vſe themſelues ſo towardes the ſonne of God? But S. Peter ſayth, that all theſe things were done according as the hand & counſel of God had firſt decréed to be done: Wherfore I think my minor in my firſt Argument that Cerberus findeth ſuch fault withall, to be ſufficiently proued.
               But nowe Cerberus hath made of my minor, a maior, and framed an Argument for his purpoſe, which I muſt ſay ſome thing to, otherwiſe wyll Cerberus glorie in his Arte.
               God doth not onely foreſée, but alſo predeſtinate all

things, yea, euen ſinne and euyll. &c. But he is Authour of all that he predeſtinateth: Ergo, he is the Authour of ſinne. The firſt part (ſaith Cerberus) is their owne aſſertion. And for my part, I acknowledge it ſo to be. But not in that meaning that Cerberus ſayth it. For it is not our hare aſſertion without proufe, but we are able by playne Scriptures and reaſōs, to proue that God doth both foreſee and predeſtinate all things, as I haue before proued in the confirming of this ſame propoſition, being the minor in mine Argument. But for more ample proufe: the Reader may conſider that which is written in the Pſalm 138. where Dauid the Prophet ſayth thus. Lorde, thou Pſal. 138. haſt proued me, and haſt knowē me. Thou haſt knowen my downeſitting and my vpryſing. Thou vnderſtandeſt my thoughts long ſince. Thou haſt ſearched my path and my coutch rounde about, and haſt foreſéene all my wayes. For loe, there is not a worde in my mouth: Beholde, thou Lord knoweſt all things. This is ſufficient for the proufe of the firſt parte of this propoſition. Which is, that God foreſéeth all things. For the proufe of the ſecond part, which is, that God predeſtinateth all things: I haue cited the words of Peter in the fourth of the Acts: wherin is affirmed, yt the power & counſel of God did firſt apoint thoſe things to be done, which were done to Chriſt by Herod, Pilate, the Gentiles, & ye people of the Iewes.
               Reaſons alſo we haue to proue the ſame, which are theſe. If God ſhould not foreſée all things, he could not be prouident in all things: but it muſt néedes be graunted that he is prouident in al things: Ergo, he doth foreſée all things. If God did not predeſtinate all things, then might his prouidence be deceyued: but his prouidence cannot be deceyued: Ergo, he doth predeſtinate all thinges. This may ſuffice for the proufe of our aſſertion. Now let vs ſee, howe Cerberus annecteth hys minor to this maior,
                  
which is this. But God is the Author of all thoſe things that he predeſtinateth. And to proue this doth Cerberus make much a doe, yea and much more than néedeth. For we will not ſticke to graunt him that God is the Author of all that he predeſtinateth. Well ſayth Cerberus, then I conclude, that God is the Authour of all ſinne & euyll. I denie that Argument.
               It were but follie to reaſon much with this bawling Curre, about the rules of Logicke: For it ſeemeth by his concluſion that he knoweth no Logicke at all. For if he did, he would not ſo ſhameleſſely inferre a neceſſarie cō
                  cluſion vpon the graunting of pure particulers. For it is a generall rule among Logitians, that A puris particular ribus nòn neceſse est ſequi veram concluſionem. It is not a thing of neceſſitie, that a true concluſion ſhoulde followe vpon thoſe propoſitions that be pure particulers. As in thys Argumēt that Cerberus hath made, the maior and minor are. Agayne, he concludeth more than is graunted in the Antecedēt (which is alſo contrary to the rules of Logick) For though it be graunted, that God is the Authour of all that he predeſtinateth: yet is he not the Authour, as Cerberus doth conclude that he is: That is to ſay, the cauſe, the ſpring, the fountaine, the roote, the beginning and Authour of any thing that is not good. For none euil thing can ſpring of him that is altogether good & nothing but goodneſſe it ſelfe. As I haue ſayd already therefore: ſo I ſay agayne. God is the cauſe, ſpring, fountaine, roote, beginning and Author of al things that haue any being. For he only hath his being of hymſelf: & all other things haue their being of him. And he alone is the worker of al actions: Nam in eo viuimus, mouemur & ſumus. In hym we lyue, moue, & haue our being. And as theſe things ſpring of God the fountaine of goodneſſe, ſo are they al excéeding Act. 17. good. And as the actiōs are wrought by him ſo are they excéeding

good alſo: although in thēſelues they be excéeding euyll, as is the Diuell and al his Angels and members, and all thoſe works that are wrought contrary to the cō
                  maundement of God. And the wordes and thoughts that are of the ſame kinde. As I haue ſufficiently proued before, by examples taken out of the holy hyſtories.
               Let Cerberus therfore loke vpon his Logiek againe, and learne to frame a Syllogiſmus better. Peraduenture being in his mad moode when he wrote this anſwere to his friendes letter: he had quite forgotten the fourtene moodes of the thrée fygures, wherin the Logicians do vſe to forme their Syllogiſmuſſes. To giue him occaſion therefore, to call himſelfe to remembraunce: I wyll ſet downe thoſe ſhort memoriall Uerſes which the teachers of Arte vſe to print in the minds of their Scholers, to the end that they ſhould not in diſputatiōs be abuſed by ſuch as Cerberus is, which vſe to frame Arguments, without eyther fygure or moode. The Uerſes are theſe.
               
                  Barbara, Celarent, Primae, Darij, Ferio
                        
                           
                        
                        que

                  Adiungens Diſamis, Datiſi, Bocardo, Feriſon.
               
               Now, if Cerberus be acquainſed with theſe Uerſes: Let him ſhewe in which of theſe fygures and moodes hys Syllogiſmus is formed. And if he find it in none of thē: then let hym deſire ſome more ſkilfull than hymſelfe, to take this matter in hande. For hys Arte wyll not ſerue him to goe thorowe withall, ſo long as he medleth wyth them that knowe what Arte is.
               I know that the matter conteined in Cerberus Syllogiſme, may be brought into the forme of a Syllogiſme in the firſt fygure, and the thirde moode called Darij. After

this maner. Whoſoeuer doth predeſtinate any thing, is the Author thereof. But God doth predeſtinate ſinne. Ergo, he is the Author thereof. Thus farre I haue holpen Cerberus to frame his Argument. But leaſt Cerberus ſhould thinke that I haue framed againſt my ſelfe ſuch an Argument as I am not able to ſalute: I wyll ſhewe the fallace of it. Firſt in the maior, the word Authour is doubtfull. For it may be vnderſtanded eyther of him that predeſtinateth or foreappointeth a thing to be done, or of him that is the doer of the ſame thing. And therfore in reaſoning it muſt be explaned and made voide of all amphibologie and doubt. For this is a rule in Logicke, that the termes which are vſed in reaſoning, muſt be plaine and voyd of all doubtfulneſſe. If we will therfore make a good maior in this Argument, we muſt ſay, that whoſoeuer doth predeſtinate or foreappoint a thing to de done, is ſo the Authour of it, that the acte or déede done, muſt be aſcribed to him, in as much as it is a déede or an act done. And then may we adde this minor, but God hath predeſtinated and foreappointed the acte or déede that is done by the ſinner: Ergo, ſo farre forth as it is an acte or a déede, God is the Authour of it. Here is not God charged with the ſinne that man committeth, for that ſpringeth of mās choyſe, which being corrupted and made bonde to ſinne by the ſinne that the firſt man firſt committed, can not of it ſelfe chooſe to do any thing in ſuch ſort, that the ſame ſhall not be ſinne. For mans wiſdome and choyſe, which S. Paule calleth the wiſdome of the fleſh, neyther is, nor Rom. 8. can be ſubiect to the lawe of God. And ſo all that man thinketh, ſpeaketh or doth in his owne wiſdome & choyſe, is againſt the law & commaundement of God, & ſo ſinne by the cōmon deſinition of ſinne, as is mentioned before.
               And to make this matter more plaine, let vs take one example or two, whereof in the holie Hiſtories & bookes

of the Prophetes, we haue many, and let vs ſée how God is the Author of the acte or déede, and not of the ſinne that is in the acte. Firſt in the .xix. Chapter of the fourth booke 4. Reg. 19. of ye Kings, we read, that when Sinacharib had blaſphemed God, and Ezechias the King had made his complaint and praiers to God: the Prophet Eſay was commaunded to ſay thus vnto the King. Be not afraid of the wordes wherewith ye haue heard the King of the Aſſirians ſeruants blaſpheming me. Beholde, I will chaunge his minde, and he ſhall heare a tidings, and ſhall returne into his owne country, & I will ouerthrow him with the ſword in his owne land. And in the end of yt ſame Chapter, the Hiſtorie ſayth thus. And when he was worſhipping in the Temple of Neſroch his God: Adramelech & Saraſer his owne ſonnes, ſlew him with the ſword. Here it is manifeſt, that God according to his promiſe made to Ezechias, hath killed Sinacharib: but yet by yt ſword of his own ſonnes. The acte in this murder is Gods, and ſo it is exceeding good, for it is the performance of Gods promiſe, and the execution of iuſt iudgement vpon the wicked blaſphemer. But the ſinne of the acte, was theyrs whoſe handes were inſtruments to murder their father. For they minded nothing leſſe than to fulfill Gods promiſe, or to execute his iudgement vpon the blaſphemer.
               The ſame example we read in the .x. chapter of Eſay the Prophet, ſet forth yet more plainely after this ſort. Eſay. 10. Come Aſſur, thou rodde of my furie, and the ſtaffe of my wrath, amongſt theſe men. &c. And a little after. But he will not think ſo, and his heart will not be ſo perſuaded: but his purpoſe will be to deſtroy, and to bring many Nations to naught. &c. Here we ſee, how God vſed Sinacharib as his rod in chaſtiſing the Nations: and yet did he ſinne in thoſe actions that God wrought by him. And we ſée alſo how God vſed his ſonnes, in deſtroying

him, and yet they ſinned in murdering their Father. So is God the Authour of the acte, which was good in him, and they Authours of the ſinne of the acte, which was euill in them.
               Another example we haue written in the .xii. chapter of the ſecond booke of the Kings, where the Prophet Nathan 2. Reg. 12. ſayth thus to King Dauid. Thus ſayth the Lord. Beholde, I will ſtirre vp euill againſt thée in thine own houſe, and I will take from thée thy wiues, euen before thy face, and will giue them to thy neighbour, & he ſhall lie with them in the open ſunnelight. Thou haſte done this déede in ſecrete: but I will doe this that I haue ſpoken of, euen in the ſight of all Iſraell, and in the open ſunnelight. The fulfilling of this is written in the .xvj. Chapter of the ſame booke. The acte whereof wrought by Abſolome, was in God, who vſed Abſolome as his inſtrument, the iuſt puniſhment that Dauids ſinne, in abuſing Uries wife, had deſerued. But the ſame in Abſolome, was abhominable and inceſtuous whoredome, whereby Abſolome minded to make all Iſraell thynke, that he abhorred his father, and that he would vtterly roote him out.
               Let this ſuffice for the making plaine of that whych I haue ſaid, concerning that which I haue ſaid, touching the acte in God, and ſinne of the wicked acte in man.
               Thus much for the matter of Cerberus Argument reduced into forme.
               Nowe let vs ſée what may be ſayd to that one place, that in ſtede of ſo many, Cerberus citeth out of S. Auſten. Which doth not onely reſolue clearely this matter betwene foreſight and predeſtination, but alſo moſte plainely teach all that is to be ſaid of Predeſtination.
               And firſt, let vs ſet downe al the words of S. Auſten, euen as they ſtande in the place whereout Proſper doth

cite them. They are writtē in the eleauenth of thoſe Articles, which are falſly impoſed vpon S. Auſten. The wordes of the Article are theſe. Quòd quando paires inceſtant 
                  Articulo. 11. fals. Aug. imp

That when the fathers do abuſe theyr owne daughters, and ſonnes theyr owne mothers, and ſeruantes murder theyr owne maiſters, the ſame is done, bicauſe God hath predeſtinated that it ſhould be ſo done. To this Article doth S. Auſten aunſwere thus. Si Diabolo obijceretur, quòd talium facinorum ipſe Autor, ipſe eſset inuentor: puto quòd aliqua ratione hac ſe poſset exo

Qua ergo inſipientia, quaue dementia deſinitur, ad Dei referrendum eſse conſiliū, quod nec Diabolo in toto aſcribi potest: qui in peccantium flagitijs, illecebrarum adiutor, nòn voluntatum credendus est eſse generator?

                        que
                      victuram ad hoc vt taliter vi
                     
                        〈…〉

                        que
                      ita ad predestinationem eius nihil amplius referri potest, niſi quòd ad debitam iustitiae retributionem, aùt ad indebitam pertinet gratiae largitatē. That is to ſay. If i
                     •
                   ſhould be layd to the Diuels charge, that he were the Authour or inuentor of ſuch wicked déedes: I ſuppoſe he might by ſome reaſon vnburden himſelfe of this enuie, and to proue that the committer of ſuch wickedneſſes, commeth of the will of thoſe men that charge him withall. For although he be delited with the outrage of them that ſinne: yet might he proue that he had not enforced them to commit the faultes. By what folly, or what madneſſe therefore, is it agréed, that that thing ſhould be referred to the decrée of God, which may n
                     〈…〉
                   be altogether aſcribed to the Diuell, which may be

thought to be an helper forwarde of the prouocations, in the wicked actes of them that ſinne, but not the begetter of their willes. God therefore hath not predeſtinated any ſuch things to be done, neyther hath he prepared that ſoule to liue filthily and wickedly, of purpoſe that it ſhould ſo liue: but he was not ignorant that it would proue ſuch a one, and he knewe before hand, that he him ſelfe ſhould execute iuſt iudgement vpon ſuch a one. And ſo, nothing may be referred to the predeſtinatiö of God, more than that, which appertaineth to the due reward of iuſtice, or to the vndeſerued gyft of grace or mercy.
               Theſe wordes (ſayth Cerberus) being thorowly weyghed: do plainly ſet forth, the full reſolution of this queſtion. It is very true, they do ſo. And therefore, I beſech thée good Reader, weigh them well, that thou maiſt by them be reſolued in this matter of Gods predeſtination. And that thou mayſt ſo be, thou nedeſt no more but to weigh the wordes of Auſtens concluſion, wherein he ſayth, that there can no more be referred to Gods predeſtination, but that only which doth appertaine eyther to the due reward of iuſtice, or elſe to the vndeſerued gift of mercie.
               When Sinacharibs ſonnes ſlew their owne father: was not the acte in this murder yt due reward of iuſtice, for that he had blaſphemed God? And had not God ſayd before, that he would ſlea him with the ſword for that blaſphemie? Why may we not then by S. Auſtens wordes, referre this déede to Gods predeſtination: Whē Abſolom abuſed his fathers wyues, was not the acte of that inceſtious whoredome, the due rewarde of iuſtyce, for that Dauid had abuſed the wife of his ſeruant Urias? And had not God ſayd before, that he would puniſh it ſo? Why ſhould not the acte therefore, in that inceſt, be referred to Gods predeſtination, euen by theſe wordes

that Cerberus citeth for his purpoſe. In like maner may we ſay of all other actions, which in the men that do thē are wicked, although we know not what ſinnes God doth puniſh by them, whereby the ſame dedes in him are excéeding good and iuſt.
               If Cerberus would, he might haue ſéene ſome other places of S. Auſten, wherein this matter is made more plaine, than the bare wordes ſéeme to make it here. Firſt in his .xviij. boke, De Ciuitate Dei. He ſayth thus. Elegit diſcipulos, quos & Apostolos nominauit, humiliter natos, inhonoratos, 
                  August. de Ciuit. Dei. 18. Cap. 49. 
                  illitteratos: vt quicquid magnum eſsent & facerent, ipſe in eis eſset & faceret. Habuit inter cos vnum, quo malo vtens benè, & ſuae paſsionis diſpoſitum impleret, & Eccleſiae ſuae tollerandorum malorum praeberet exemplum. That is to ſay. He (that is to ſay Chriſt) did chooſe Diſciples, whom he called alſo Apoſtles, men borne of poore parentes, not called to honour, vnlearned: that he might be and do in them, what ſo euer they ſhould be, or do. Among theſe he had one that was naught, that by vſing well that euill and naughtie one, he might both fulfill the order of his owne paſſion, and alſo giue vnto his Church, an example how to beare and ſuffer thoſe that be wicked.
               Againe, in his firſt Sermon vpon the firſt part of the. 34. Pſalme: S. Auſten ſayth thus: Ille videbat traditorem ſuum, & elegit illum magis adopus neceſsarium, illius 
                  August. in Pſalm. 34. 
                  malo magnū bonum operatus est. Et tamèn inter duodecem electus est, nè ipſe duodenarius tā exiguus numerus eſset ſine malo: hoc ad exemplū nostrae patientiae, quoniam neceſse erat vt inter malos vineremus. That is to ſay: He (that is Chriſt) did ſée and know him that ſhould betraie him, and he did the rather chooſe him as one neceſſarie for that buſineſſe, and by the euill of that traytour he did worke a great good worke. And yet was the traitour choſen among the twelue, leſt that little number of .xij. ſhould be without a naughtie

one: this was done for an example of our patience, bycauſe of neceſſitie we muſt lyue among ſuch as he euill. Againe in the. 59. tract. vpon Iohn he ſaith. Quod ergo dico, 
                  August. in Iohn. tract. 59. 
                  inquit, beati critis, ſi feceritis ea, nòn de oībus vobis dico. Est inter vos qui nòn erit beatus, ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      faciet ea, & ego ſcio quos elegerim: quos? niſi cos qui beati erunt faciendo quae praecepit, ac facienda monstrauit, qui efficere beatos potest? Nòn est igitur traditor Iudas electus? Quid est ergo quod alio loco dicit? Nonnè ego vos duodecem elegi, & vnus ex v
                        •
                     bis Diabolus est? An & ipſe ad aliquid electus est, ad quod vti
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      erat neceſsarius? Nòn autem ad beatitudinem, de qua modo ait, Beati critis ſi feceritis ea. Hoc nòn de omnibus di cit, ſcit enim quos ad ſociet atem beatitudinis huius elegerit. Nòn est exeis iste, qui panem illius ſic edebat, vt ſuper eū leuaret calcancum. &c.
               
               That is to ſay: Where as I ſay therfore (ſaith Chriſt) ye ſhalbe happie, if he ſhal do thoſe things: I do not ſpeak thoſe words of you al. There is one amongſt you y• ſhall not be happie, neyther ſhall he do thoſe things. And I do know whō I haue choſen. Whō hath he choſen? None but thoſe, that ſhalbe bleſſed in doing thoſe things, that he which is able to make them bleſſed hath commaunded & ſhewed y• they ought to be done. Is not y• traitor Iudas elected then? What meaneth that then, that Chriſt ſaieth in another place? Haue not I choſen you .xij. and one of you is a Diuell? Was he alſo elected to ſome thing, wherevnto euen he was neceſſarie? Trulie, he was not elected to the bleſſedneſſe, whereof Chriſt ſpake before, when he ſayd: ye ſhall be happie if ye doe thoſe things. He ſpeaketh not this of all: for he knoweth whome he hath choſen to the fellowſhip of this bleſſedneſſe. This fellow, which did ſo eate Chriſtes bread, that he did lyft vp his héele againſt him, is none of that fellowſhip. &c.
               Againe, the ſame Sainct Auſten in the. 62. treatiſe August. in Iob. tract. 62. vpon Iohn ſayth thus. Niſi ergo ſe traderet Christus, nemo traderet,

Christum. Quid habet Iudas niſi peccatum? Ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      enim in tradendo Christo ſalutem nostram cogitauit, propter quam traditus est Christus: ſed cogitauit pecuniae lucrum, & inuenit animae detrimentum. Accepit mercedem quam voluit: ſed nolenti est data quam neluit. Tradidit Iudas Christum: tradidit Christus ſcipſum. Ille agebat negotium ſuae venditionis: iste nostrae redēptionis. Quod facis facito citius, nòn quia tu potes, ſed quia hoc vult qui omnia potest. That is ſay. Except therefore Chriſt would deliuer vp himſelfe: no man coulde betraie him. What was there in Iudas more than ſinne? For in betraying Chriſt he minded not to work our ſaluation, for which Chriſt was betrayed: but his minde was vpon the gaine of monie, and he founde the loſſe of his owne ſoule. He receyued the reward that he deſired: but that reward which he was not willing to haue, was giuen vnto him being vnwilling to haue it. Iudas did betraie Chriſt: and Chriſt did deliuer vp himſelfe. The one applied his marchandize, the other, our redemption. That thou doeſt, doe quickly (ſayd Chriſt) not bicauſe thou art able to do it: but bicauſe he that is able to do all things, is willing it ſhould be ſo.
               Againe, in the hundreth and .vij. treatiſe vpon Iohn, he ſayth thus: Quos dedisti mihi custodiui, & nemo ex hijs perijt, 
                  August. in Iohn. tract. 107 
                  niſi filius perditionis, vt Scriptura impleatur. Filius perditionis dictus est proditor Christi, perditioni praedestinatus, ſecundum Scripturam, quae de illo in Pſalmo Centeſimo octauo maximè prophetatur. That is to ſay: I haue kept thoſe that thou haſt giuen vnto me, and none of them is periſhed, ſaue only the childe of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. He that betrayed Chriſt is called the childe of perdition, bicauſe he was predeſtinated to deſtructiō, according to the Scripture, which in the Pſalme. 108. chieflye is prophecied of him.
               Aſſaine in his queſtions vpon Exodus, and the. 18.

queſtion. S. Auſten ſayth thus. Aſsiduè Deus dicit, Indurabo 
                  August. lib. 2 Queſt. ſup. Ex. Questione. 18. 
                  cor Pharaonis: & velut cauſam inſert, cur hoc faciat, & implebo ſigna mea & portenta mea in Aegypto: tanquàm neceſsaria ſuerit obduratio Pharaonis, vt ſigna Dei multiplicarentur vel implerētur in Aegypto. Vtitur ergo Deus benè cordibus malis, ad id quod vult ostendere bonis, vel quod facturus est bonis. That is to ſay: God doth oftentimes ſay, I wil harden Pharaos heart: and he doth as it were bring in a cauſe why he would doe it, ſaying: And I will fulfill my ſignes and wonders in Egypt: as though the hardening of Pharao ſhould be neceſſarie to the multiplying and fulfilling of Gods wonders in Egypt. God therfore, doth vſe well thoſe hearts that be euill, for the fulfilling of that thing that he is willing to ſhowe to them that are good, or of that which he mindeth to do for them.
               If Cerberus had had eyes to ſée: he might as well haue ſéen theſe places of Auſten, as that one place which he thinketh ſo ſufficient for the declaration of the whole matter. And there is not one of theſe places, that is not of equall authoritie with that one place of his. Yea, and the firſt of theſe places is of greater authoritie, as may appeare to them that will reade the bookes of S. Auſtens Retractations.
               In theſe places S. Auſtē ſaith, that Chriſt choſe to be his diſciples, ſuch men as were born of poore parentage, not called to honour, and vnlearned: that he migh the and do in them, whatſoeuer they ſhould be, or do. The actions therefore, that were done by them, were his actions, and were in him exceeding good, although the ſame were in ſome of thē excéeding euill. This thing is made more plaine in the other places cited oute of S. Auſten. Firſt he ſayth: Chriſt know him that ſhould betraie him, and he choſe him ſo much the rather, as one neceſſary for his buſineſſe. And againe he ſayth, ſpeaking of

Iudas, was not he alſo elected to ſome thing wherevnto he was neceſſarie? And againe. Except Chriſt would haue deliuered vp himſelfe: no man could haue betrayed him. What was there in Iudas but ſinne? As who ſhould ſay, the acte was Chriſtes, but the ſinne in the acte was Iudaſſes. Yea, he ſaith furder: That which thou doeſt, do quickly. Not bicauſe thou art able to do it: but bicauſe he that is able to do all things will haue it ſo done. And laſt of all he ſayth of Iudas, that he was called the child of perdition, bicauſe he was predeſtinated to deſtruction.
               I ſuppoſe if Cerberus had ſéene and well weyghed theſe places of Auſten: he would not haue triumphed ſo greatly in that one place of his. Neyther would he haue derided the iudgement of thoſe that aſcribing the acte vnto God, do iuſtly aſcribe the ſinne of the ſame acte vnto ſinfull man, from whoſe frée choyſe conſenting vnto euyll, the ſinne of the acte doth ſpring, and not from God from whom nothing can come that is not excéeding good (as it commeth from him.) But let vs now ſée how this hell hound playeth with his owne tayle.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               But to returne againe vnto thoſe, that contrarie to the Scripture, and all auncient writers: doe teach, that God doeth not onely foreſee, but alſo predeſtinate both good and euill, as well the murder of Caine, as the holineſſe of Abell: and thereby make God plainly the Authour of ſinne. Whē they perceyue the outragious blaſphemie, to be ouermuch apparant and manifeſt: then doe they ſometimes cloſely rolle it vp in a riddle agayne. Which yet for the darke ſpeach thereof, may ſerue at the

leaſt, to blind the eyes of ſome. As where (among many other wayes) they plainly make God the Author of ſinne is, ſaying that God is not only the principal cauſe, but alſo the Authour of al things without exception, both on the one ſide and on the other. If they be then vrged with the conſequence, that God is the Authour of ſinne: they will aunſwere, that in all abhomination, God is the Authour of the fact, but not of the crime, as of the fact, deede or worke of adulterie, Sodometrie, murder and Idolatrie, God is the Author ſay they, but not of the fault or crime. This Enigma haue I heard ſome men vſe, and it is alſo written in a booke, entitled, a briefe treatiſe of election and reprobation, lately ſet forth and printed in the Engliſh tong, where he ſaith thus. Though we be compelled to ſay, that God is the Authour of the fact: yet we muſt anſwere, but not of the crime.
               Areade, areade, what is that? God is the Author of the very fact & deede of adulterie, theft, murder, and treaſon: and yet he is not the Authour of ſinne. And why? The ſubtilitie of the Riddle is this. That ſinne is nothing. The theefe is not hanged for the deede that he hath cōmitted (for God is the Author therof) but he is hanged for the ſinne, and that is for nothing. For whē they ſay, God is the Author of all things, then nothing is excepted. But ſin is nothing, & therfore he is not the Author of ſinne. The theefe is hanged for nothing. The murderer is put to death for nothing. The traitor loſeth his head for nothing. The wicked are puniſhed in euerlaſting fire for nothing. A maruellous ſophiſtication. A ſtraūge Paradox, & cautelous riddle. But to be ſhort, though many ways, this ſubtiltie might be anſwered: I wil take onely the definition of ſinne, as I finde it written in

the ſame booke, where he ſayth verie truly.
               The nature of ſinne, is defined by the authoritie of Scripture, to be a thought, word or deede, contrary to the wyll of God.
               Now, bicauſe they ſay, that God is the Author of all euil deedes, though not of the crimes: let vs paſe ouer the euill thought, and euill words, and ſpeake onely of the deede it ſelfe, whych he hymſelfe deſineth to be ſinne, and contrary to Gods wyll. If God then be Authour of the fact or deede, which deede is ſinne, and cōtrarie to Gods wyll: how can he then ſay, that God is the Authour of the fact, but not of the fault, ſoyng he hymſelf ſetteth forth, not only a thought or a word, but alſo a deede to be ſinne? And if God be the Authour of that ſame deede, whych deede is ſinne: is it not a thing moſt plain, that God is the Authour of ſinne?
            
            
               Crowley.
               Marke gentle Reader, I pray thée, how this Puppie playeth with his owne tayle. He imagineth that all, euē as many as do hold, that God doth not only foreſée, but alſo predeſtinate al things both good and euill: do therin holde that God is the Authour of all ſinne and abhominable wickedneſſe. The contrarie whereof is in the former part of this Apologie, ſufficiently proued. But he hath heard, he ſayth, yea and ſéene in an Engliſh booke, an Enigma, a maruellous ſophiſtication, a ſtraunge Paradox, and a cautelous Riddle, which is this. Though we be compelled to ſaye, that God is the Authour of the fact: yet we muſt aunſwere, but not of the crime.
               Areade, areade, what is that? ſayth Cerberus. The Curre can not ſmell how the acte may be Gods, and the

ſinne that is in the acte: his that is the inſtrument in the working of the acte.
               But the ſubtiltie of this Riddle, ſaith he, is this. That ſinne is nothing. And then the theefe is hanged for nothing, the murderer is put to death for nothing, the traytour loſeth his head for nothing, and the wicked are puniſhed in euerlaſting fire for nothing. But this is ſome thing. That Cerberus ſayth that there is ſome thing wherof God is not the Authour. And ſo it followeth vpon his wordes, that eyther there is another being beſides God, whereof thoſe things that God is not the Authour of, haue their being: or elſe that thoſe things haue theyr being of themſelues, and are therein equall with God, whoſe greateſt honour is, in that he is and hath his being of himſelfe. But Cerberus muſt be borne withall, whatſoeuer be ſayth. For if he be contraried: all hell ſhall ring of his bauling. We may not conclude vpō his wordes as he doeth vpon ours. But for this once I will be bolde to ſay, that if God be not the principall cauſe and Authour of al things wythout exception: then there be ſome things, whereof God is not the principall cauſe and Authour. And ſo muſt it needes follow, whether Cerberus will or no, that the words in the beginning of S. Iohns Goſpell are not true, Omnia per ipſum facta ſunt, & ſine ipſo factū est nihil quod factum est. By him Iohannis. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . were all things made, and nothing that was made, was made without him. But we knowe this ſaying to be true. Wherefore we are bolde to conclude, contrarie to the iudgement of Cerberus: that God is not onely the principall cauſe, but alſo the Authour and maker of all things. And bicauſe Cerberus ſayth that we holde a Paradox contrarie to al the auncient writers: let him read that which S. Auſten writeth in the. 26. Chapter of hys August. lib. Retrac. cap. 26 firſt booke of Retractations. His wordes be theſe. Viri

                        que
                      bonum est, omne quòd iustū est. That is to ſay: Whether God be not the Authour of the thing that is euill? where men muſt take héede, that they do not miſcō
                  ſter that which I haue ſayd, that is: That God is not y• Authour of that which is euill, for he is Authour of all thoſe things that haue any being, for in aſmuch as they be, they be good. Alſo men muſt take héede, that hereby they take not occaſion to thinke, that the puniſhment of the wicked cōmeth not of God: which puniſhment, is alſo euill vnto them that be puniſhed. But I ſpake this, euen as it is ſayd, that God made not death. Whereas in another place it is written. Death and life are of the Lord God. The puniſhment therefore of the wicked, which commeth of God, is euill vnto them that be euil. But yet it is among the good workes of God. For it is right that the wicked be puniſhed, and euery thing that is right, is good.
               I ſuppoſe that when Cerberus hath reade and well weighed theſe wordes of S. Auſten: he will not ſay that we hold a Paradox, vnleſſe he minde to match S. Auſtē with vs. Which if he ſhall do, he ſhall ſhake his owne building verie ſore. For it ſtandeth well moſt altogether vpon S. Auſtens groūd, although without Sainct Auſtens conſent.
               But Cerberus will looke, that ſome thing ſhould be ſayd to the aunſwere that he maketh to our ſubtile ſophiſticatiō.

For he ſéemeth to himſelfe to haue ſayd ſo much that will we nill we, it muſt be cōfeſſed that God being the Authour of the thing that is euill, he is alſo the Authour of the euill and ſinne that is in the thing.
               
                  Cerberus ſaw many wayes, whereby the ſubtiltie of our Riddle myght be aunſwered: but he would vſe only the definition of ſinne, whiche he found written in the ſame Engliſh booke that our Enigma is written in. Oh what a valiant champion is this, he will vſe none of his owne weapons: he wil be able to wound vs, yea vtterly to beate vs downe and conquer vs with our owne weapons. Uerie trulie hath that Engliſh writer ſayd (ſayth Cerberus) that the nature of ſinne, is defined by y• authoritie of Scripture, to be a thought, word or déede contrarie to the will of God. And bicauſe he will not ſéeme to take too much vauntage: he paſſeth ouer the thoughts & words, and taketh only the déedes done againſt the will of God. And with them he wil beate vs down flat to the ground.
               The reaſon that he vſeth, is this. If God be the Authour of that déede that is ſinne and contrarie to the will of God, how can he ſay that God is the Authour of the fact and not of the fault? Here is a ſubſtantiall anſwere. Bicauſe Cerberus can not tel how it ſhould be ſo: therfore it is not ſo, neyther may any man ſay it is ſo. And yet I haue proued it to be ſo, both by the example of Sinacharibs death and other. As Cerberus may ſée, if he will, in the former part of this Apologie.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               And all thys their trauell is to proue, that the ordinaunce and predeſtination of God, doth ſo carrie men euen headlong, vnto all actions, though they

be neuer ſo miſchieuous: that of neceſſity they muſt needes and can not chooſe but commit the ſame. As though Gods predeſtination were like a tempeſt of winde, ſo blowing in the ſayles of a mans heart, that by it he is caried headlong to all things, whatſoeuer he doth, according to the ſaying of the Poet, Iam magis at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      magis, praeceps agit omnia Fatum. Nowe, more and more deſtinie hurleth al things headlong. But ſurely, this Stoicall neceſſitie, maketh ſuch a confuſion of all things: that let them colour vp the matter, with as much cunning as they can, and qualifie it with as fayre wordes as may be: yet ſhall there neuer the ſtate of a common wealth in England ſtand, if thys perſuaſion may once take roote amōg the people, beſide that it is vtterly repugnant to the holie Scripture, and againſt all the auncient wryters, as ſhalbe hereafter briefly proued.
            
            
               Crowley.
               Nowe Cerberus is bolde to affirme, that all that we do, is nothing elſe but to proue, that Gods ordinance and predeſtination doth carrie headlong all men into all actions, be they neuer ſo miſchieuous, as a tempeſt carrieth all afore it. &c. Surely Cerberus is too bolde herein: and doeth much miſtake the purpoſe of our trauaile. If he would, he might ſée (except ye ſmoke of Hell haue marred his ſight) that our purpoſe i
                     •
                  , to proue that God in wiſdome doth knowe, foreſée and order all things. And that nothing can be done by any creature otherwiſe than as by his inſtruments, which he doeth vſe in wiſedome, mercie, and iuſtice, and that ſo all actions are his, as the chiefe worker in all things. And that the ſame actions, as they are wrought by him, are excéeding good: although

in the creatures that God vſeth for his inſtruments, ſome of them be excéeding euill. But Cerberus ſayth, we doe maintaine Stoicall Fatum or deſtinie. And that if thys perſuaſion may once take place in the people: there ſhall neuer ſtate of a Commonwelth ſtand in England. Beſides that, it is contrarie to the holie Scripture, and againſt all the auncient writers, as he will briefly proue. Well good Reader. Marke I praye thee, how Cerberus ſhall proue that he promiſeth to proue: and how he ſhall be aunſwered againe. And then doubt not but thou ſhalt ſée how well that blind Curre ſtandeth in his owne conceyte, and thinketh himſelfe to haue a cleare ſight.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               And where they denie this doctrine of theirs to be the Stoicall opiniō, bicauſe the Stoikes (ſay they) fayned, that nature, wyth ſuch order of cauſe as ſhe hath tyed together, doth bring all things to paſſe by neceſſitie. But they affirme, that God by his eternall predeſtination, foreordinance, and prouidence, bringeth all things to paſſe by like neceſſitie. Thus doe the beſt learned of them make the difference. But a playne diluſion it is, to blinde the eyes of men withall. For (as Priſcianus ſayth) Fatum, (which we call deſtinie) is deriued of the particple Fatus, whych is as much to ſay, as ſpoken. Bicauſe it is nothing elſe (ſaith he) but that which is ſpokē or appointed of God. As if a mā ſhould ſay, it muſt nedes be ſo, for God hath ſpoken the worde. Euſebius alſo citing the definitiō of Chriſippus, ſayth, that Fatum is nothing elſe but a certain decree, ordināce or determination of God. Which thyng (to make no more rehearſall of many mens ſayings) Auguſtine plainely

declared in his booke, De Ciuitate Dei. Lib. 5. Cap. 1. Thus ſayth he is it proued, that they dyd call the will of the high God, Fatum. Gods wyll ſayeth Auſten, they called Fatum, or deſtinie. It is manifeſt therefore that the Stoikes did not imagine, that nature by an order of cauſes brought all things to paſſe by neceſſitie. But rather that God, foreordeining and appointing in order all cauſes in nature or otherwyſe: brought all thyngs to paſſe by neceſſitie. Whych thyng together wyth the order of cauſes, Tullie ſpeaketh of plainly, ſaying: Fati neceſsitas. &c. The neceſſitie of deſtinie (ſayth Tullie) is that, which of God is ordeyned and appointed that it come to paſſe by an euerlaſting order of cauſes.

               The Stoikes & we (as Cerberus ſayth) do differ only in this. That they affirme al things to come to paſſe by ye neceſſitie of deſtinie: & we, by ye neceſſitio of Gods eternal predeſtination, foreordinance, & prouidence. And this is the difference that the beſt learned amongſt vs do make. Who theſe beſt learned be, Cerberus doeth not tell vs. But this I am ſure, that none amongſt vs that is learned, wyll ſay that there is none other difference betwene the Stoicall opinion and ours, thā that which Cerberus hath ſet downe. For the Stoikes helde, that the willes of men are not vnder the neceſſitie of their Fatum or deſtinie, bicauſe they could not ſée how it ſhould ſo be, and yet be frée alſo, as it may well appeare by that that S. Auſtē writeth in the .x. Chapter of his fift booke. De Ciuitate Dei. where his words are theſe. Vnde, nec illa neceſsitas formidandaest, 
                  August. De Ciuit. Dei. lib. 5. Cap. 10. 
                  quam fermidando Stoici laborauerunt: cauſas rerum ita distinguere, vt quaſdam ſubtraberent neceſsitati quaſdam ſubderent:

                      in his quaes eſse ſub neceſsitate noluerunt, poſuerunt etiā nostras voluntates, nè videlicet nòn eſsent liberae, ſi ſubderentur neceſsitati. &c. That is to ſay. Wherefore, that neceſſitie is not to be feared, the feare whereof cauſed the Stoikes ſo to deuide the cauſes of things, that they pulled away ſome things from neceſſitie, and thruſt ſome things vnder it: and amongſt thoſe things that they would not ſuffer to be vnder neceſſitie, they haue placed our willes, leſt they ſhould not be frée, if they ſhould be ſubiect to neceſſity. &c. But we hold, that al things, our willes & altogether, are ſubiect to Gods prouidēce: Ergo, there is more difference betwéene the Stoikes and vs, than Cerberus ſayth that there is. And it is no diluſion at all that we vſe in yt we refuſe to cal it Fatum or deſtinie: although we know that Priſcianꝰ & Tullie, Euſebius, Chriſippus & other, do in their ſorts ſpeake of Fatum, after ſuch ſort, that to the negligent Reader there may ſéeme ſmal difference betwene them and vs, in the matter of Gods eternal and euerlaſting prouidence and predeſtination. For we follow herein S. Auſten, whoſe ſentence Cerberus would faine frame againſt vs. But I pray thée gentle Reader, marke well the wordes of S. Auſten, euen in the ſame booke, out of which Cerberus citeth matter againſt vs. Yea and in the ſelfe ſame Chapter, which is the firſt of the fift booke: where the wordes that he fathereth vpon S. Auſten, are not found. But theſe wordes are found there. Prorſus diuina prouidentia, regna constituuntur humana. Quaeſi propterea quiſquam fato tribuit, quia ipſam Dei voluntatem vel potestatem ſati nomine appellat, ſententiam teneat, linguā corrigat. Cur enim nòn hoc primum decit, quod postea dicturus est, cum ab illo quiſquā quaeſierit, quid dixerit Fatum? Nam id homines quando audiunt, vſitata loquendi conſuetudine, nòn intelligunt niſi vim poſitionis ſyderum, qualis est quandò quis naſcitur, ſiue concipitur: quod aliqui alienant à Dei voluntate, aliqui

ex illa etiam hoc pendere confirmant. That is to ſaye. The Kingdomes of this worlde, are altogether ordeyned by the prouidence of God. Which if any man haue giuen vnto deſtinie, bicauſe he doeth call the will or power of God it ſelfe, by the name of deſtinie: let the ſame continue in his opinion, but let him reforme his tong. For why doth he not at the firſt ſay that, which afterward he will ſay, when any man ſhal aſke him what he doth call deſtinie? For when men do heare that thing: they do not by the common maner of ſpeach vnderſtande any other thing, than the force of the poſition of the ſtarres, as the ſame is when any is borne or conceyued: which ſome men do ſeperate from the will of God, and ſome do proue that the one doth hang vpon the other.
               In theſe wordes S. Auſten doth plainly affirme, that euen Kingdomes of this world are appointed by Gods prouidence: and yet he denieth that the ſame ſhould be ſaid to be appointed by deſtinie. Wherefore in affirming the one, and denying the other, we doe but as S. Auſten doeth.
               How aptly Tullie is cited for the purpoſe of Cerberus: ſhal plainly appeare in mine anſwere to that which here followeth.

               The ſame order of cauſes alſo, is not forgotten of our mē, that in al points their doctrine might agree wyth the Stoicall doctrine. As in an Engliſh booke, tranſlated out of French, lately ſet forth in print, & entitled, a briefe declaration of the table of predeſtination, where he ſayth. Seyng God hath appointed the end: it is neceſſarie alſo, that he ſhould appoint the cauſes which leade vnto the ſame ende. As

if he ſhould ſaye. Like as God hath appointed ſome man to be hanged: ſo hath he appointed him alſo to ſteale, as a cauſe leading vnto the ſame end whervnto he hath appointed him. Or elſe, it was his deſtinie to be hanged: Ergo, it was his deſtinie to ſteale. Or thus (which is all one) he was appointed by Gods predeſtination to be hanged: Ergo, he was appointed by Gods predeſtinatiō to ſteale. For ſeyng God hath appoynted the ende (ſayth he) it is neceſſarie alſo, that he ſhould appoint the cauſes that leade vnto the ſame ende. As for enſaple. If thys be true, which they ſay, that God doth predeſtinate all things, or that God doth both appoint the end of all things, and alſo the cauſes which leade vnto the ſame end: then doth it follow & may truly be ſayd, that Marten Swarth wyth hys men, was appointed and predeſtinate of God to be ſlaine at the battel of Stoke. And furder, it foloweth, as God appoynted Marte & his fellowes to this end: ſo was ſir Richard Symō the Prieſt, appointed & predeſtinate of God, to poure in the peſtilent poyſon of priuie conſpiracie, & traiterous miſchiefe of vayne glorie into the heart of Lā
                  bert his ſcholer, as a cauſe leading to the ſame ende. Item that the ſayd Lambert, was appointed & predeſtinate of God, to conſent and agree vnto the peſtiferous perſuaſion of his maſter Sir Richard, in the pride of Lucifer, to aſpire vnto the high type of honor, in depoſing (if it poſſible were) the ryght and moſt noble heire of England, and eleuating hymſelf lyke a trayterous villaine, into the royall throne of the ſame, and that thus he was appointed of God to doe, as another cauſe leading vnto the ſame ende which God ordeyned. Item, that the Iryſh men were appointed of God to be Rebellious traytours

againſt their Soueraigne Lord the King of England, and to maintayne the falſe and filthy quarrell of the ſaid Lambert, as another cauſe leading to the ſame end. Item that the Ladie Margret ſiſter vnto King Edward the fourth, was appoynted and predeſtinated of God, to be a traytoureſſe to Englande, and to employ all hir wyt, ſorce and power, to the vtter deſtruction of hir naturall countrie, as another cauſe leading vnto the ſame end. Item that the ſayd Ladie Margret was appoynted of God to conduct and hire Marten Swarth and hys men, to inuade the Realme of England, as another cauſe leading to the ſame end. Item that the ſayd Marten Swarth, the Earle of Lincolne, the Lord Louell, the Lorde Gerarde, and diuers other Captaines of the Rebels, were appointed or predeſtinated of God, to be of ſuch valiant courage, in maintayning the falſe quarrell of trayterous Lambert, that they were ſlaine: on the other ſide, many a true Engliſh mans bloud, at the battell of Stoke, which was the ende of this wofull Tragedie, and by this, theyr manifeſt forme of doctrine, was altogether and euery part, appointed and ordeined of God, both the end and alſo the cauſes aboue rehearſed, and other innumerable, whych did leade vnto the ſame ende.
            
            
               Crowley.
               Here are many words and little matter. Great Items and ſmall ſummes. A great deale of deſcant and no good plaine ſong. Seing God hath predeſtinated the ende: it is neceſſarie alſo that he ſhould appoint the cauſes which leade vnto the ſame end, ſayth an Engliſh booke entitled a declaration of the table of Predeſtination. And what

hath Cerberus ſaid here, to diſproue this conſequence? So far as I am able to iudge: we may graunt him all that he hath ſaid: and yet affirme ſtill, that if God haue appointed the ende: he hath alſo appointed the cauſes that leade to the ſame end. But I will vnderſtand Cerberus, as I ſuppoſe he meaneth: that is, that God doth neither appoint the end, nor cauſes that leade therevnto. If this be not his meaning: then hath he ment nothing, but to make ſimple men ſuppoſe that he is able to ſaye much. And ſée, gentle Reader, how well he agréeth wyth S. Auſten, whoſe authoritie he woulde faine vſe, both in ſteade of a ſword and buckler. In the eyght chapter of his fift booke. De Ciuitate Dei. S. Auſten ſayth thus. Qui verè nòn astrorum constitutionem, ſicut est eum quid

                        que
                      certandum est: quandoquidem ipſum cauſarum ordinem, & quandam connexionem, Dei ſummi tribuunt voluntati & potestati. Qui optimè & veraciſsimè creditur, & cuncta ſcire antequam ſiant, & nihil inordinatum relinquere: à quo ſunt omnes potestates, quamuis ab illo nòn ſint omniū voluntates. That is to ſay. As for thoſe men, which do call by the name of deſtinie, not the conſtitutiō or order of the celeſtial ſignes, as y• ſame is at the conception, birth, or beginning of any thing, but the knitting together & order of all cauſes, whereby euerie thing that is done, is brought to paſſe: we néede not much to labour and contende with them about the controuerſie of that word: bicauſe they do attribute to y• wil & power of God, that order and certain knitting together of cauſes, which is verie well and truely thought to knowe all things before they come to paſſe, and to leaue nothing vnordered: of whom al powers haue their being, although all mens willes doe not ſpring of him.
               
                  
Here mayſt thou ſée (gentle Reader) howe Cerberus falleth out with him, whoſe authoritie he woulde ſéeme chieſly to leaue to. Auſten ſayth, that whatſoeuer is done commeth to paſſe by that knitting together and continuall order of cauſes which the Stoikes call deſtinie. But Cerberus will haue al ſet at ſix and ſeauen, and that nothing ſhould come to paſſe by any ſuch order. Auſtē ſayth that it is verie well and truely thought, that God doeth knowe all things before they come to paſſe, and that he doth leaue nothing vnordered. But Cerberus will none of that. For then muſt Marten Swarth & his men, Syr Richard Simon Prieſt, and his ſcholler Lambert, the Iriſh men, Lady Margret, the Earle of Lincolne, the Lorde Louell, with the reſt that rebelled in King Edwarde the fourthes time, be appoynted and ordeyned of God to doe as they did. But rather than it ſhould be ſo, Cerberus wyll ſay with Cotta, that there is no God at all. For ſo doth S. Auſten conclude vpō 
                  Ciceroes diſputation that he hath agaynſt the Stoikes. His wordes be theſe. Quomodo igitur ordo cauſarum, qui praeſcienti certus est Deo, id efficit, vt nihil ſit in nostra voluntate, cū in ipſo cauſarum 
                  August. lib. 5 De Ciui. dei. 9 
                  ordine, magnū habeant locum nostrae voluntates? Contendit ergo Cicero cum cis qui hūc cauſarum ordinem dicunt eſse fatalem, vel potiùs ipſum fati nomine appellant, quodnos abhorremus: praecipuè propter vocabulū, quod nòn in re vera conſueuit intelligi. Quod vero negat ordinem omnium cauſarum eſse certiſsimum, & Dei praeſcientiae notiſsimum: plus eum quam Stoici detestamur. Aut enim deum eſse negat, quod quidem inducta alterius perſona in librii de Deorum natura, facere molitus est: Aut ſi eſse conſitetur Deum, quē negat praeſcium futurorum, etiam ſic dicit nihil aliud, quàm quod ille dixit inſipiens in corde ſur, non est Deus. Qui enim non est praeſcius omnium futurorum: non est vtique Deus. That is to ſay. How doth the order of cauſes then, which is certayne to God that knoweth them before, bring to paſſe,

that there ſhould be nothing in our will: ſeing 
                     〈…〉
                  wils to beare a great ſway euen in the order of cauſes it ſelfe? Let Cicero therefore ſtriue with them that ſay that this order of cauſes is fatall, or rather that do giue it y• name of deſtinie, which thing we do abhorre: chiefly for the name, which is not accuſtomed to be vnderſtanded in the thing it ſelſe. But where as he doth denie that the order of all cauſes is moſt certaine and knowen to the preſcience of God: we do deteſt him more than the Stoikes did. For either he doth denie that there is a God, which thing in his bookes concerning the nature of the Gods, he doth vnder an other mans perſon endeuour to do: or elſe, if he do confeſſe that there is a God, whom he denieth to know of things before they come to paſſe: euen ſo ſaying, he doth none other thing than did that fooliſh mā which ſaid in his heart, there is no God For he that doth not knowe afore hand all things that are to come, doubtleſſe the ſame is not God. If Cerberus had had ſo much leyſure as to read ouer this ninth Chapter of S. Auſtens fift booke, out of the which he would faine finde matter againſt vs: no doubt he would not haue bragged ſo much of S. Auſtens authoritie. But by like he truſted ſome other mens notes gathered out of S. Auſten, and neuer ſaw the bookes of S. Auſten himſelfe. I ſpeake this in his fauor. But ſée gentle Reader, how well Cicero ſerueth for the purpoſe that Cerberus doth alleage him for. And as thou findeſt him in this point, ſo truſt him in the reſt. Cicero doth not only reaſon againſt them that ſay there is a deſtinie called in Latine Fatum: but alſo againſt all that ſay there is a God that hath knowledge of things to come. And ſo conſequently he affirmeth that there is no God at all. Spoyling God of his foreknowledge (as S. Auſten ſayth) rather than he would ſuffer August. lib.

(ſayeth S. Auſten) doeth chooſe both, doeth confeſſe both, and with the faith of godlineſſe doth cōfirme both. That is to ſay, the foreknowledge of God, and the libertie of mans will. So that whatſoeuer man doth, we ſay and beleue, that he doth it with the conſent of his will.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               Alas who ſeeth not the deſtruction of England to follow this doctrine? who ſeeth not the confuſion of all common weales, to depend herevpon? What Prince may ſit ſafely in the ſeat of his kingdome? What ſubiect may liue quietly poſſeſſing hys owne? What man ſhall be ruled by right of a lawe: if thys opinion may be perfectly placed in the heartes of the people? But to be ſhort: thou ſeeſt here by example, the ſame which Tullie calleth Series cauſarum, the continuall order of cauſes appointed of God. And our men euen in like maner, call it the cauſes appointed of God, to leade vnto the ſame end which he hath ordeyned. Whereof followeth the force of cannot chuſe, which is called Fati neceſsitas, Fatall neceſſitie, or the neceſſitie of Gods ordinaunce: for as you haue heard, Fatum is nothing elſe but a decree or ordinance of God. Which neceſſitie is ſet forth of ſome men vnder the name of Gods predeſtination, & now oftentimes the ſame thing is ſet forth alſo by thys word prouidence. Which name of prouidence likewiſe the Heathen Stoikes vſed for the ſame purpoſe, as Cicero ſayth. Pronoca anus fatidica Stoicorum, quam Latinè licet prouidentiā dicere. Pronoca in Greke, ſaith he, the olde wyſe of the Stoikes that ſetteth forth theyr deſtinie, which in Latine was called Prouidētia, the prouidence of God. But let them cal it prouidence, predeſtination,

preordinance, or what they will: this is (no doubt) the very Stoikes opiniō, that God hath ſo appoynted and preordeyned all thyngs, that of meere neceſſitie they come to paſſe. And whatſoeuer men do, whether it be good or euill: they can not choſe but do it. Which neceſſitie Seneca alſo manifeſtly declareth in theſe wordes. Neceſsitates omnium rerum quas nulla vis rumpat: fatum existimo. The neceſſitie of all thinges, ſayth he, which no force or violence can breake: that ſame I holde to be deſtinie.
            
            
               Crowley.
               Nowe Cerberus can no longer kéepe it in. He muſt néedes breake out in an exclamation againſt the doctrine of prouidence, predeſtination & preordinance. For (ſayth he) it is none other thing than the very opinion of yt Stoikes, call it what we will. Who ſéeth not the deſtruction of England? &c.
               If God doe by his prouidence gouerne all things: If God haue predeſtinated or preordeyned all things, ſo that they ſhall come to paſſe in ſuch time and order as God by his prouidence, predeſtination and preordinance hath appoynted that they ſhall: then muſt no man be ſo blinde as not to ſée, that Englande muſt be deſtroyed. Then muſt all Commonweales come to confuſion. Then ſhal no King ſit ſafely in his kingdome, nor any ſubiect in his poſſeſſion. Yea, no man ſhall be ruled by the right of a law: but if God do leaue the matter to mans diſcretion, to vſe the matter as he ſhall ſée cauſe, and doe but put to his helping hand when he ſéeth that man goeth about to bring things to good effect, but in any caſe determine vpon nothing, tyll the ſame ſhall be by mans wyſedome deuiſed and enterpriſed: then ſhall England and all other

Commonweales ſlouriſh ſtyll, then ſhall all Princes ſafely ſit in their Kinglie ſeates, then ſhall all ſubiectes quietly enioy their poſſeſſions, and euery man be ruled by the right of a lawe. Thus much followeth vpon the pityfull complaynt that Cerberus maketh vpon the doctrine of Gods prouidence, his predeſtination, or preordinance: but I would gladly know, what Cerberus thinketh to be the cauſe, that in King Edwarde the fourthes dayes, Marten Swarth, Syr Richard Simon, and the reſt, made ſuch a ſtyrre in England. Was it for that they were perſuaded in this doctrine that Cerberus ſeemeth to make the cauſe of all ſuch doings? Surely I ſuppoſe there was not one of them that did once dreame of any prouidence of God. For thoſe that take ſuch matters in hand, are cōmonly as great enimies to Gods prouidēce, as is Cerberus himſelfe. And ſhall Cerberus wordes make vs afrayde, to ſay that God in his prouidence had predeſtinated & preordinated all thoſe things to be done? yea, & that it could not otherwiſe be, but that thoſe things muſt then be done? Surely, I can ſée no cauſe why we ſhould feare ſo to ſay: Let Cerberus and his fellowes conclude what they wil. For I am ſure S. Auſten in the x. Chapter of his fift boke De Ciuitate Dei: will take our parte herein. His wordes are theſe. Si autem illa definitur eſse neceſsitas, ſecundum quam dicimus, neceſse eſse vt ſit aliquid 
                  August. lib. 5 10. Cap. de Ciuit Dei. 
                  velità fiat: neſcio cùr eam timeamus, ne nobis libertatem auſerat voluntatis. That is to ſay. If we call that thing neceſſity, whereby we ſay of anie thing that it muſt needes be, or that it muſt néedes be ſo done, then do not I ſee why we ſhould feare, leaſt that ſhould take from vs the libertie of our will. When we ſay therefore that of neceſſitie Marten Swarth and the reſt, muſt make ſuch a ſtyrre as they did in King Edward the fourthes dayes: do we take frō them the libertie of their wil? No ſayth S. Auſten. For

they did whatſoeuer they did, with the frée cōſent of their willes, and felt no conſtraynt at all: But Cerberus is not ſo ſatyſfied, he wyll be inquiſitiue to knowe what ſhoulde be the cauſe why God woulde in his prouidence predeſtinate theſe men to doe theſe things. I wil anſwer with S. Auſten, I can not tell. God doth know a cauſe: but he hath not made Cerberus and me priuie to it. Occulta 
                  Epist. 59. ad Paulinum. 
                  cauſa eſse potest, iniusta nòn potest. That is. The cauſe may be ſecrete: but it can not be vniuſt. Is there any iniquitie with God? God forbyd. What Seneca thought of deſtinie, we paſſe not. But with S. Auſten we ſaye. Omnia verò fato fieri nòn dicimus, imò nulla fieri fato dicimus:

We ſay not that al things do come to paſſe by deſtinie: yea we ſay that nothing is done by deſtinie. For we do plainely ſhew, that the name deſtinie is of no value, in the place where men vſe to place it in ſpeaking, that is in the conſtitution of the heauenlie ſignes, wherein euerie man is conceyued and borne, bicauſe the thing it ſelfe is vainely affirmed. As for the order of cauſes, wherein the will of God is of great force and power: we doe neither denie, nor call it

by the name of deſtinie, except it be ſo as we may vnderſtand Fatum to be deriued of the word For faris, that is of ſpeaking. For we can not denie but it is wrytten in the holie Scriptures: God ſpake once, theſe two ſayings, I my ſelfe hearde it: that power belongeth vnto God, and vnto thée (O Lord) belongeth mercie: for thou wilt giue vnto euerie man according to his workes. And where as it is ſaid, he ſpake once: we vnderſtand that he ſpake vnmoueably, that is vnchaungeably, euen as he did vnchaungeably know al things that are to come, and that he himſelfe will do. After this ſort therfore, we may ſay that Fatum or deſtinie, is deriued à fando, or ſpeaking, if this name had not now bene accuſtomed to be vnderſtā
                  ded of another matter, wherevnto we are not willing that mens hearts ſhould be enclined.
               Now if Cerberus haue ought to ſay againſt this, let him make S. Auſten one of vs. For we are in this point all one with him.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               And as for that which the Heathen did attribute to the ſtarres or planets, they meant none other, but that God ordeined the planets in nature to worke ſuch things, as he before had decreed & appointed: Euen as we alſo iudge, that God vſeth the operatiō of the planets in ſending ſuch rayne & tempeſt, faire weather or ſoule, as his pleaſure is, let them ſay therfore what they cā or wil. This meere neceſſitie which our men do teach, is the verie ſame which the Stoikes did hold, which opinion bicauſe it deſtroied the ſtate of a common wealth, it was baniſhed out of Rome, as Auguſtine declareth. Lib. Queſt. vet. & no. Teſt. Where he notably refelleth that opinion in theſe

few words, ſaying. Qua ratione nati dicuntur. &c. By what reaſon (ſayth Auguſtine) were they borne which baniſhed Mathematicos, the ſetters forth of deſtinie out of Rome, which law was kept, and they were but Heathen, howe were thoſe things done by deſtinie which make agaynſt deſtinie? But ſurely if there be a deſtinie, it doth nothing againſt it ſelfe, ſaith Aug. For ſo were deſtinie, no deſtinie, or at the leaſt, deſtinie fighting agaynſt it ſelfe: Or to ſpeake the ſame in thoſe wordes, which our men by abuſe take out of the Scripture, to maintain the very ſame matter. If it be Gods predeſtination that men ſhould write and ſpeake agaynſt hys predeſtination, as they ſaye ſome men do, then is Gods predeſtination a Kingdome, not only deuided, but alſo fearcely fighting agaynſt it ſelfe. O miſerable abſurditie which any child may perceyue muſt needes follow, if all things come to paſſe with abſolute neceſſitie by Gods predeſtination as they teach. Thys ſame doctrine alſo that all euill ſpringeth out of Gods ordinance, or that Gods predeſtination was the cauſe of Adams fall and of all wickedneſſe, is plainly maintained in an Engliſh boke lately ſet forth and entitled agaynſt a priuie Papiſt. &c. where among many open and plaine ſentences vpō this matter. I find an argument made in theſe words: Whatſoeuer was in Adam was in him by Gods wil & ordināce: ſinne was in Adam, Frgo ſinne. &c. was in him by Gods will & ordināce. The maior of which argument being vnderſtand of Adam after his fall, is manifeſtly falſe, & therefore the cōcluſion alſo is falſe, for if it may be ſayd of Adam after his fal (as by the minor you wel perceyue that he ſo doth vnderſtand it) then may it alſo be ſayd now of any man, that what execrable wickedneſſe ſo euer

is in any mā, that ſame is in him by Gods wil & ordināce. He goth about alſo to proue the ſame by another argumēt which he maketh ſpeaking of the lying ſpirit, ſaying: God cōmaūded him to ſinne, but God commaūded nothing which he ordeineth not, ſo he ordeined him to ſinne. Which argument it was maruel that any man could be ſo blind as not to ſee how it might with more ſtrength and force, and much more manifeſt truth be turned againſt him in this ſort: ſpeaking of Adam, yea and of all men ſaying, God commaunded Adam, and doth commaunde all men to abſteine from ſinne, but he commaundeth nothing which he ordeineth not. Ergo God ordeined Adam and all men to abſteine from ſinne. If God then ordeyned Adam and all men to abſteine from ſinne, than did he not ordeyne Adam or any man to commit ſinne, ſo was not ſinne in Adam, or in any man by Gods will and ordinance, nor Gods ordynance the cauſe of Adams fall, or of any mans ſinne. And therefore their opinion is vtterly falſe: alſo if God in hys ſecret counſell do predeſtinate, appoint, and ordeine man to ſinne, and yet gyue vnto him a ſtraight law and commaundement not to ſinne: is not then his ſecret wyll contrary to his open word? and hys eternal ordinance, repugnant to his written law: All theyr ſayre wordes and ſine framed fetches can not auoide it.
            
            
               Crowley.
               Let vs ſay what we can or wyll (ſayth Cerberus) the méere neceſſitie that we teach ſhall be all one wyth that which the Stoikes helde, affirming their Fatum, or deſtinie. To this I haue ſufficiētly anſwered before, ſhewing

plainly by S. Auſtens words, that we teach none other doctrine herein, than did S. Auſten in the ſame booke De Ciuitate Dei, out of which Cerberus citeth matter againſt vs.
               But nowe Cerberus hath founde another authoritie of ſaint Auſten agaynſt vs, in his booke (as Cerberus ſayth) which he wrate, and entitled: Questiones ex vtro
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      Testamento. In the queſtion. 115. he ſayth thus. Qua autem ratione nati dicentur, qui Mathematicos vrbe Roma prohibuerūt, quod ius ſeruatum non ignoratur? Et certè Pagani fuerunt. Quomodo fato fiunt quae contra fatum ſunt? Sed ſi est fatum, non facit contra ſe. &c. That is to ſay. By what order ſhall it be ſayd that thoſe men were borne, which did forbydde the Mathematicks (that is to ſay) ye tellers of mens fortunes, or deſtinies to come within the Citie of Rome. And it is wel knowen that that lawe was kept. And doubtleſſe theſe men were Heathen men. Howe are thoſe thinges done by deſtinie, which are againſt deſtinie? But if there be a deſtinie, it worketh agaynſt it ſelfe. &c. ſayth Auſten. But ſtay there Maſter Cerberus: and proue that Auſten was Authour of that booke. So may it be of ſome authoritie with vs. But Eraſmus hath alreadie proued by ſū
                  drie good reaſons, that S. Auſten did neuer write it. As may appeare to as many as wyll reade his iudgement ſet forth before the beginning of this booke. Where wryting of this parte of that booke, out of which Cerberus hath cyted the wordes aboue wrytten, he ſayth: Disputat contra Mathematicos, quo
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      altius ingreditur opus, hoc licentius ineptit. That is to ſay. He diſputeth agaynſt the Mathematicks, and the déeper he doth enter into the worke, the more outragiouſly doth he play the parte of a foole.
               But Cerberus wyll not ſet a Louſe by the iudgemēt of Eraſmus. He wyll conclude vpon the wordes of hys Auſten, that ſo deſtinie ſhoulde be no deſtinie, or at the

leaſt, deſtinie fighting againſt it ſelfe. Nay, he wyll not ſtay there, but as though deſtinie and Gods predeſtination were all one thing: he wyll conclude, that it is alſo a Kingdome, not onely deuided, but alſo fiercely fighting agaynſt it ſelfe. And then knitte vp the matter with hys maner of exclaming. O miſerable abſurditie. &c. Cerberus his heart would haue bruſt, if he might not haue borowed his fellowes bable to fetch one flouriſhe wythall. Euery childe may ſée (ſayth Cerberus) what abſurditie muſt néedes follow. And euery wiſe man may ſée (ſay I) that there can no abſurditie followe vpon that neceſſitie that we teach. For it taketh away no fréedome that mans will hath, or euer had. Neyther doth Gods predeſtination ſight againſt it ſelfe, bycauſe Cerberus wyth his fellowes, were predeſtinated before the worlde was in this time of the world, thus to go about to deface thoſe that doe truely teach, that Gods preſcience, prouidence, and predeſtination is infallible. For what wiſe man wil ſay, that the Potmaker is contrarie to himſelfe, bycauſe he maketh of his clay ſome veſſels to ſerue in honourable vſes, and ſome other to vſes cleane contrarie? Or who wil ſay that God is contrarie to hymſelf, bycauſe he hath made, and doeth daylie make ſome of his creatures to be deuourers and deſtroyers of the reſt: or that nature doth fight againſt it ſelf: bicauſe it doth bring forth both helthſome foode and poyſon? Surely I thinke there is no man of that minde but Cerberus and his fellowes, and that Auſten that Cerberus citeth for his purpoſe. But how worthy credit that Auſten is: is afore ſufficiētly declared.
               But Cerberus hath found in an Engliſhe Booke entitled againſt a priuie Papiſt, two Argumenes: one in theſe words. Whatſoeuer was in Adam, was in him by Gods wil & ordinance: ſin was in Adam: Ergo, ſinne. &c. The other ſpeaking of the lying ſpirite, in theſe words.

God commaunded him to ſinne: but God commaundeth nothing which he ordeyneth not: ſo he ordeyned him to ſinne. Cerberus miſlyketh much with theſe two Arguments. The maior propoſition in the firſt Argument is falſe, ſayth Cerberus. Wherfore, the concluſion can not be true. But S. Auſten in his Enchiridion ad Laurentium: ſayth that the maior is true: Ergo it is lyke that Cerberus ſayth not truely. Saint Auſtens wordes be theſe. Haec ſunt magna opera Domini, exquiſita in omnes voluntates eius: &

                     tinet, quod Deus noluit fecerunt: quantū verò ad omnipotentiam Dei, nullo modo id efficere valuerunt.

                      magna opera Domini, exquiſita in omnes voluntates eius, vt miro, & ineſtabili modo, non fiat praeter eius voluntatem, quod etiam ſit contra eius voluntatē. Quia non fieret, ſi non ſineret: nec vtiquè nolens ſinit, ſed volens. Nec ſineret bonus malè fieri: niſi omnipotens etiam de malis facere poſset benè. That is to ſay. Theſe are y• great workes of God, ſought out, according to all his wylles: and yet wyſely ſought out, ſo that when the nature both of Angels and man had ſinned: that is, had done, not the thing that he wylled, but that it ſelfe wylled, euen by the ſame will of the creature, wherby that thing was done, that y•. Creator was not willing ſhould be done, he fulfilled that which he would haue done, euen as he that is beſt of all, vſing well, euen thoſe things that are euill, to the condemnation of thoſe whome he hath iuſtly predeſtinated to paine: and to the ſaluation of thoſe whom he hath louingly

predeſtinated to frée mercy. As touching themſelues, they did y• which God was not willing they ſhould do: but as touching the almightie power of God, they were by no meanes able to bring that to paſſe. For euen in the verie ſame thing that they did contrarie to the wil of God: his will was wrought vpon them. For that cauſe therefore, the workes of the Lord are great, & ſearched out according to all his willes. So that after a maruellous and vnſpeakable maner, that thing that is done euen contrarie to his will: ſhould not be done without his will. For if he would not ſuffer it, it ſhould not be done: neyther doth he ſuffer it being vnwilling, but willing. Neyther would he that is good, ſuffer a thing to be euill done: except the ſame being almightie, were alſo able to worke a good effect of thoſe things that be euill.
               Thou maiſt ſée here, gentle Reader, how great cauſe Cerberus hath to miſlike with this Argument. S. Auſten ſayth, that after a maruellous and vnſpeakable maner, that thing that is done contrarie to the will of God, is not without his will. And thou mayſt be bolde, rather to conſent vnto that which was written againſt a priuy Papiſt, hauing Auſten alſo on thy part: than by Cerberus his miſliking to be perſuaded that that writer hath taught an vntrueth.
               Of the other Argument, Cerberus ſayth, that it was maruell that any man coulde be ſo blinde, as not to ſée how the ſame might with much more ſtrength and force, and manifeſt truth be turned againſt himſelfe that made it, in this ſort. God commaunded Adam, and doth commaund all men, to abſtaine from ſinne: But he commaundeth nothing which he ordeineth not: Ergo God ordeyned Adam and all men to abſteyne from ſinne. But what hath Cerberus wonne by this: I graunt the Argument to be good. But that the concluſion is againſt vs

I denie. For we affirme that when man abſtaineth frō ſinne, the ſame is done by Gods will and ordinance, as whē he committeth ſinne, the ſame is alſo by the wil and ordinance of God: as by the words of Auſten afore written doth plainly appeare. As for Cerberus his argumēt, and the concluſion that he inferreth therevpon: I referre to the iudgement of all wiſe men that will weygh the afore written words of S. Auſten. Who ſhall thereby eaſily perceyue, that no ſuch concluſion can follow vpon ſuch premiſſes. But to his, Alſo if God in his ſecret counſell. &c. I muſt ſay ſome thing. Elſe will Cerberus ſay that Gods ſecret will and eternall ordinance, is contrary to his open word and written law.
               When Ionas was ſent to Niniue, the open word & cōmaundement of God was, that he ſhould ſay vnto thē: Yet fortie dayes and Niniue ſhalbe deſtroyed. The effect doth declare, that his eternall purpoſe was not to deſtroy them, for they were not deſtroyed. Neyther was this cō
                  maundement contrarie to his eternall purpoſe: but he did vſe it as a meane whereby to bring his eternall purpoſe to paſſe, which was to ſhew mercie in forgiuing the ſinnes of the Niniuites.
               When Moſes was ſent to Pharao, the open word and commaundement was thus. Say vnto Pharao, let my people go, that they may offer ſacrifite vnto me. But his eternall purpoſe was, that by the ſtubbornneſſe of Pharao in refuſing to do his commaundemēt, he might haue iuſt occaſion to ſhew his power vpon him, in pouring out vpon him and his people, the manifold plagues that we reade of in the holie Hiſtories, and that thereby his name might be made knowen in all partes of the earth. So that this cōmaundement was not contrarie to the eternal purpoſe, but did concurre & run together with it, to that ende, that in the eternal purpoſe was prefixed.
               
                  
When Ieſus Chriſt began to preach, the open word was, Repent and beleue the Goſpell: but the eternall purpoſe was, that for his doctrine & miracles, he ſhoulde be hated of his countriemen and kinſemen (for the moſt part) and by them be deliuered to the Heathen to be crucified, and made a ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the world. So that this open word was not againſt the ſecret purpoſe of God: 
                     〈…〉
                   as S. Paule doth terme it) it was to them that periſhed, the ſauor of death vnto death, and to them that be ſaued, the ſauor of life vnto life. For in the one ſort it did worke beliefe, and by beliefe ſaluation: and in the other it did manifeſt and make open the vnbeliefe that was in their heartes before, and ſo make them vtterly without excuſe. As our Sauiour himſelfe ſayth: Now haue they nothing to pretend for excuſe.
               The Law and the Goſpell are both written & preached, and the open word is, do this, and thou ſhalt haue this: but the eternall purpoſe of God is, that thoſe that haue cares to heare, ſhould heare and obey, and ſo enioy the reward promyſed: and that they which lacke ſuch eares, ſhould haue the iuſt condemnation of their owne conſciences. Theſe two therefore be not contrarie the one to the other, but doe concurre and runne together to one ende.
               Much more might be ſaid to this effect, without either faire words or finely framed fetches: and ſo the inconuenience that Cerberus would conclude, clearely auoyded. But I will content my ſelfe with one ſaying of Auſten, writing vpon the ninth Pſalme. His wordes be theſe. Non in toto corde conſitctur Deo, qui de prouidentia eius in aliquo dubitat. Sed quia iam cernit occulta ſapicutiae Dei, quantum ſit inuiſibile premium cius, qui dicit, gaud
                        〈…〉
                      in tribulationibus, & quemadmodum omnes cruciatus, qui corporaliter inferuntur, aut vt exerceant conuerſos ad Deum, aut vt conuertantur admoneant,

aut iustè damnationi vltimae praeparent obduratos: & ſic omnia ad diuinae prouidētiae regimen referrantur, quae ſtulti quaſi caſu & temere, & nulla diuina administratione fieri putant, ait. Narrabo omnia mirabilia tua. &c. That is to ſay. That man which doth doubt of the prouidence of God in anye thing: doth not ſhew himſelfe thankful or praiſe God in all his heart. But bicauſe he doth now ſée the ſecretes of the wiſedome of God, how great the inuiſible reward of him is which ſayth, we reioyce in troubles: and how all afflictions which are brought vpon the body, eyther to exercyſe thoſe y• be conuerted vnto God, or that they may admoniſh them to conuert, or that they may prepare to the laſt damnation, thoſe that be iuſtly made hard hearted, and that ſo all thoſe things might be referred vnto the gouernement of Gods prouidence, which fooliſh men do ſuppoſe to be wrought by chaunce, at aduenture, and by no diuine prouidence: he ſayth. I will declare all thy wonderous workes. &c. We maye be bolde therefore (I thinke) to ſay, that this which Cerberus hath done, in writing this ſpitefull aunſwere to his friendes Letter (if any ſuch were) was gouerned by Gods prouidence. And yet we are not Genethliaci, or declarers of mens fortunes or deſtinies, ſuch as were baniſhed out of Rome: for we ſay not y• it is Cerberus his fortune or deſtinie to be hanged or drowned, or that he ſhal die a natural death before he ſhalbe as great a fauourer of Gods predeſtination, as he doth now ſhew himſelf to be a mortall foe therof. But we knowe, that if God haue predeſtinated any of theſe things, the ſame ſhall vndoubtedly come to paſſe, in ſuch ſort as he hath appointed. And yet ſhal not Cerberus his will be enforced. But if he hang himſelfe, it ſhall be with the full conſent of his will. And if he ſhalbe a fauourer of our ſide, it ſhalbe with the frée choyſe of his owne will, gouerned by the prouidence of God. As there be ſome yet

liuing, that can teſtifie, that once they were of the ſame minde that Cerberus is now, and that with conſent of will. And now they be of one minde with me: and that with aſſent of will alſo.
               We leaue Cerberus and his fellowes therefore to him that by his prouidence gouerneth al things. And yet do we our ſelues vſe the meanes that God in prouidence hath appointed to be vſed, and we teach all other to do the ſame, committing the ſucceſſe to him that knoweth what he hath determined to worke in all his creatures. And we conclude this matter with Auſten, ſaying: Quapropter, 
                  Aug. De Ciuit. lib. 5. cap. 9 
                  & voluntates nostrae tantum valent, quantum Deus eas valere voluit at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      praeſciuit: & ideo, quicquid valent certiſsimè valent: & quod facturae ſunt ipſae, omninò facturae ſunt: quia valeturas at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      facturas ille praeſciuit, cuius praeſcientia falli nòn potest. Quapropter, ſi fati nomen, alicui rei adhibendum placeret: magis dicerē fatum eſse infirmioris, potentioris voluntatem qui eū habet in potestate, quàm illo cauſarum ordine, quem nòn vſitato, ſed ſuo more Stoici fatum appellant, arbitrium nostrae voluntatis auſerri. That is to ſaye. Wherefore, this is the cauſe why our willes are able to doe, as much as God would & did know afore hand that they ſhould do, and therefore, loke what they are able to do, that are they moſt certainly able to do: and what ſo euer they ſhall do, they ſhall in déede do: bicauſe he whoſe preſcience or foreknowledge cannot be deceiued, did know afore hand that they ſhould do it. Wherefore if I could allow the name of deſtinie to be giuen to any thing: I would rather ſay that deſtinie were a thing belonging to the weaker, and will to the ſtronger which hath it in his power, than that the liberty of our will, ſhould by that order of cauſes, which y• Stoikes, not after the common cuſtome, but after their own maner, do cal deſtinie. But Cerberus is not yet aunſwered. We muſt yet ſolue him one other queſtion. Which

now he will propone.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               Yet would I further aske them a queſtion, ſeeing it is the decree, ordinance, and wyll of God expreſſed in his word, that man ſhould not ſin, how crepte they into that ſecret councel, where God ordeined, decreed, and willed the contrarie? that is to ſay, that man ſhould ſinne. But I heare their anſwere already publiſhed in print: ſtanding in the third leafe & ſeconde page, of the firſte Blaſt in that traiterous trū
                  pet, ſet forth agaynſt the regiment of women, where Fol. 2. Pa. 2. briefly and couertly toucheth this cloſe and priuie counſell of God in theſe wordes. The ſecrete counſell of God excepted. But in Fol. 3. Pag. 2. he ſayth. I am ſure that God hath reuealed to ſome in this our age, that it is more than a Monſter in nature, that a woman ſhall raigne and haue Empire aboue man.
               This may be the Apocalips of ſome men in thys our age: but ſure I am, it is not the reuelation of S. Iohn the Euangeliſt, nor of any other olde Apoſtle or Prophet. Theſe new reuelations which are reuealed vnto men of our age out of a ſecrete counſel, decree, and ordinance of God, contrarie to the open worde and commaundement of God, are meete for thoſe which delight in the dānable dreames of ſome doting deſtinie, and may well be called inſpirations of olde Arrians, reuelations of blinde Anabaptiſtes, or vnwritten verities of ſuperſtitious Papiſts, rather than the ſecrete counſel of God, reuealed vnto men of our age. But to conclude: That Angell or ſpirite, which contrarie to the manifeſt word of God, hath

reuealed vnto men of our age, that a woman bring right inheritour to the Crowne of a Realme, ought not to be ruler thereof, that ſame ſpirit and Aungell of darkneſſe, hath reuealed vnto mē of our age, that Caine was predeſtinate to murther his brother Abel, and the moſt wicked traytours, murtherers, & theeues that lyue, are ordeyned of God, in his ſecrete counſell, contrary to his open worde, to be wicked, euen as they are, and to commit ſuch murther, theſe and treaſon, euen as they doe. The ſame concluſion and newe reuelation, is alſo playnly ſet forth in the other late printed Engliſh boke before named, tranſlated out of French into Engliſh, where an on after the beginning, ſpeaking of Gods wyll, he ſayth: By the vertue wherof, al things are made, yea euē thoſe thyngs whych are euill and execrable. Yet when he hath plainly affirmed that by the vertue of Gods wil euill and execrable things are made, leaſt the horrible face of Sathan ſhould be perceiued, in the burning flame of thoſe terrible wordes: The matter is afterward trimly couered with a cloke of vnſauerie ſubtiltie, for he declareth his mind to be, that thoſe euil and execrable things, which are wrought by the vertue of Gods will, are not euill and execrable, in that they are wrought by his diuine counſell. As if he ſhould ſay, though they be in deede euil and execrable things, which the counſell of God worketh, yet are they not in that reſpect or therfore euill, bicauſe God worketh thē. But for as much (ſayeth he) as they proceede from the Prince of ayre. &c. Or to ſpeak it in more vſual termes, bicauſe the diuel or wicked men do work it, which neuertheleſſe, as they plainly hold and affirme, are the inſtrumētes of God appointed her vnto, & in doing the ſame, do nothing

elſe but that which God hath ordeyned them to do, & ſo ordeyned that they can not choſe but do it, euē as they do, which opinion Prosper, defending the ſentence of Auguſtine, writeth vehemently againſt, in theſe wordes. Praedestinationem Dei ſiuè ad malum ſiuè ad bonum &c. That the Predeſtination of God (ſayth he) d
                     〈…〉

Reſpō. ad obiect. Gal. cap. 6. But that which Proſper, and Aug. do here moſt truly call a moſt foliſh ſaying. The ſame do theſe men call the moſt hygh & profoūd wiſdom, for God ſay they, predeſtinateth al things, Ergo al things muſt come to paſſe of neceſſitie.

               A man might maruell, what moued Cerberus to moue that queſtion, the aunſwere whervnto, he himſelf ſayth is alredie publiſhed in print. But when I conſider, what ſpirit it is that hath moued him in this ſort to aunſwere his friendes letter: I leaue off that maruell. For I ſée his purpoſe is, by this meane to entangle and trouble vs with by matter, neyther pertinent to the thing we haue in hande, nor tending to any good ende. What haue we to do with the matter of the Blaſt (which booke I neuer reade of) or with Reuelations or Apocalipſes? We haue the queſtion of Gods Prouidēce, Preſcience & Predeſtination in hande. To diſpute of thoſe matters did neyther appertaine to Cerberus in hys aunſwere, neyther doth it appertaine to me in this Apologie. I wyl therefore paſſe ouer both thoſe queſtions: and ſhape him

another maner of anſwere to his demaund than y• which he imagineth that he hath ſéene ſet forth in print. His queſtion is, how we crept into y• ſecrete counſell, where God ordeyned, decréed and willed, that mā ſhould ſinne? He imagineth that this can not be aunſwered otherwiſe than by an Apocalips or Reuelatiō. But Cerberus ſhall well vnderſtande, that we can aunſwere him by playne Scripture, & proue that it is not againſt Scripture, that God ſhoulde ordaine, decrée and will, that man ſhoulde ſinne.
               Firſt, S. Paule writing to the Romanes ſayth thus. Annō habet potestatem Figulus luti, ex eadē maſsa facere, aliud 
                  Rom. 9. 
                  quidem vas in honorem, aliud vero in contumeliam? That is to ſaye. Hath not the Potmaker power ouer his Claye, out of one lumpe to make one veſſell to honor, and another to diſhonor? And in the ſame place he ſayth thus. Nunquid dicit ſigmentum ei qui ſe ſinxit, quid me fecisti ſic? That is. Doth the earthen veſſell ſay vnto him that made it: Why haſte thou made me ſo? And the ſame S. Paule writing to Timothe ſayth. In magna autem domo, non ſolum ſunt vaſa aurea & argentea, ſed & lignea & fictilia: & quaedā

In a great houſe, there be not onely veſſels of Golde & of Siluer, but alſo of Timber and of Earth: ſome ſeruing to honor, and ſome to diſhonor. Theſe Alegories doth S. Paule vſe, to ſhew that there is no iniquitie with God, though he do appoint his creatures at his good will and pleaſure, ſome to honor, and ſome to diſhonor. To the ſame purpoſe doth S. Paule cite the wordes that are written in the. 33. of Exodie. Miſerebor, cuius miſercor: & miſericordiam praestabo, cuius miſerebor. That is. I will haue compaſſion vpon him, on whome I haue compaſſion: And I will ſhewe mercy, to whome I will ſhewe mercy. It lyeth not in the willer nor in y• runner, ſaith S. Paul:

Nequè enim venicitèr ob aliud vocatur omnipotens, niſi quia quicquid vult poteſt, nec voluntate cuiuſpiā creaturae, voluntatis omnipotentis, impeditur effectus. That is to ſaye. It is not to be doubted that God doth well, yea, when he ſuffreth to be done, whatſoeuer things are euill done. For he doth not ſuffer this, otherwiſe than by iuſt iudgement. And ſurely, all that is iuſt, is good. Although therfore thoſe things that be euill, in as much as they be euill, be not good: yet is it good, y• there ſhould be things, not onely that are good, but alſo that are euill. For excep

were good, y• there ſhould be things that are euill: the almightie goodneſſe would by no meanes ſuffer them to be. To whome, no doubt, it is as eaſie a thing not to ſuffer that thing to be which he would not ſhould be: as it is to doe that which he is willing
                     •
                   to doe. Except wée beleue this▪ ſhe very beginning of the confeſſion of our ſayth, wherein we confeſſe y• we beleue in God y• Father Almightie, is in daunger & like to be foſid vntrue. For he is not truely called Almightie for any other cauſe, but for that he is able to do what he will, & the effect of his wyll, being Almightie, is not by the wil of any creature letted.
               By theſe wordes of Auſten it is playne, that God, being Almightie can not be ſayd to ſuffer ought to be done, which he is not willing ſhould be done. The hardening of hearts therfore, and that wickedneſſe that is wrought by the hard hearted, is not done without his wil. And although thoſe things be euill, in aſmuch as they are done by thoſe euill perſons, yet in as much as the ſame are done by the will of God, it is good that they be done. By thys it is plaine, that when God doth ordeyne, decrée, and will that man ſhoulde ſinne: he doth not contrarie to Scripture, which doth witneſſe, by the teſtimonie of S. Auſten, that it is good that man ſhould do euil, in ſuch ſenſe as S. Auſten hath declared the ſame.

                      lignum est. That is to ſay: Shall the Are boaſt it ſelfe againſt him that heweth with it? Or ſhal the Saw ſet by it ſelfe againſt him that draweth it?

That were as much as if the Rod ſhould be lifted vp againſt him that lifteth it, and as if the ſtaffe that is but timber, ſhould be aduaunted.
               The vngodlie man, ſayth Salomon, hath the Lorde made for himſelfe, euen againſt the euill day: that is, againſt the day of vengeance, wherein the vngodly ſhall haue theyr iuſt reward at Gods hand. By this, not onely the vngodlie is iuſtly puniſhed for his vngodlineſſe, but the godlie is alſo occaſioned to acknowledge, that it is mercie alone that doeth preſerue him frō the like puniſhment. For he ſeeth in himſelfe no cauſe why he ſhould not ſuffer the ſame condemnation. Thus by the wicked, both the iuſtice and mercy of God are made manifeſt vnto man. But the purpoſe of the vngodlie is nothing leſſe than that Gods iuſtice and mercie ſhould be ſet forth by him: therfore he is iuſtly puniſhed for his wickedneſſe. And Eſaie the Prophet, comparing Nabuchodonoſor to an Axe, a Sawe, and a Rodde: doth plainly teach, that it was God that wrought all the plagues and deſtructions that were by that wicked inſtrument brought, not onely vpon the people of the Iewes, but vpon other Nations alſo. And that that bloudie and ambitious tyrant, was but as an Axe, Saw, or Rod in the Lords hād. And therfore when he began to boaſt of his owne power and policie, as though he had by his own wiſdom and ſtrength ouercome kingdomes, and ſet himſelfe aboue them: the Lord (to let his people know that it was not Nabuchodonoſors power that could haue done, or that ſhould doe thoſe things to them, which the Prophetes did tell them ſhould come vpon, by the Kings of Babilon) doeth tell them by the mouth of the ſame Prophets, that the worke was his, and that the Kings of Babilon were but hys fooles or inſtrumentes to worke withall.

                   Areade, Areade, what is this? In Cerberus his iudgement, eyther Iob muſt be a liar, or elſe God muſt be a théefe. For when word came to Iob that the Sabeis had ſlaine his ſeruauntes, and driuen away his cattle: he ſayd, the Lord hath taken thē away. But to take away Iobs cattle was felonie, Ergo, eyther God was a Felon, or Iob a liar, if Cerberus his opinion beleue.
               But how God doth worke in the heartes of euill and wicked men, and vſe them as his inſtruments, and yet is not partaker of their ſinne: is ſufficiently declared afore, out of S. Auſten, De gratia & libero arbitrio.
               
               Nowe Cerberus will looke that I ſhoulde ſay ſome thing to the words of Proſper. Otherwiſe he wil make reckning that he hath the victorie. For a little occaſion maketh him to brag. The obiection that the Frenchmen made againſt the ſentence of S. Auſten, in the place that Cerberus ſpeaketh of, is this. Quòd liberum arbitrium in homine nihil ſit: ſed ſiue ad bonum ſiue ad malum, praedestinatio

                      homines quaedam neceſsitas videatur impellere: cum in bonis, voluntas ſit intelligenda degratia, in malis autem intelligenda ſine gratia. That is. To ſay that frée will is nothing, or that there is no frée will at all, is euil ſayd: but that the ſame doth wander in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death before it is illumined by faith, is not well denied. For before it is by the grace of God deliuered from the domination of the Diuell: it lyeth in that déepe dongion, into which by it owne libertie it did caſt it ſelfe. It doth therfore loue it owne ſore ſickneſſes, and doth compt it helth, not to knowe that it is ſicke, vntyll this firſt medicine be miniſtred to it being ſicke, that it may begin to know that it is ſick, and be able to deſire the helpe of the Phiſition, whereby it may aryſe. When man therefore is iuſtified, that is to ſay, made godlie of vngodlie, without any good deſeruing going before, he receyueth a gift, by which meane he maye alſo get merit or deſeruing: that that thing which is by the grace of Chriſt begonne in him, may alſo by the induſtrie of frée will be encreaſed, neuer without the helpe of God, without which no man can eyther go forward, or ſtay in that which is good. But it is moſt fooliſhly ſaid, that the predeſtinatiō of God doth ſo worke in men, eyther to good or to euill, that a certain neceſſitie may ſéeme to force men forward vnto both: ſeeing that in good, the will is to be vnderſtanded to come

of grace, & in euill, the will is to be vnderſtanded without grace.
               Now (gentle Reader) thou ſeeſt what it was that the French men obiected againſt: S. Auſten. Thou ſéeſt alſo what Proſper doth anſwere in S. Auſteus defence. Cō
                  ſider nowe what occaſion Cerberus hath to conclude againſt vs as he doth.
               The French men obiect, that S. Auſten ſhould hold that fréewill in man is nothing, but that Gods predeſtination doth worke in men, whether it 
                     〈…〉
                  to good or euyl. Proſper aunſwereth, that it is an euil ſaying: to affirme that fréewill is nothing, or that there is no fréewill at al. And that it is moſt fooliſhly ſayd, that the predeſtination of God doth ſo worke in the heartes of men, either to good or euill, that a certaine neceſſitie may ſéeme to force men forward vnto both. But we do neyther ſay that fréewill is nothing, or that there is none at all: neither that predeſtination doth ſo worke in men, that a certaine neceſſitie may ſeme to force them forward both to good and euil: No, we do not affirme that predeſtination doeth worke in men any thing at all. Ergo, Proſper hath written nothing againſt vs.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               And further, Crowley in the ſayd booke of confutation before named, and the ſame article, vſing the very ſame terme of driuing, he ſayeth that Gods predeſtination hath driuen them to it. And yet not therwith content, anone after he ſayeth: We are cō
                  pelled by the neceſſitie of Gods predeſtination, to do thoſe things for the which we are damned, but to repeate the whole ſentence. To this muſt we anſwere (ſayth he) in thys wyſe. If God were an inferiour to

anie ſuperior power, to the which he ought to render an accompt of his doings, or if anie of vs were not his creatures, but of another creation beſides his workmanſhip, then might we charge him with tyrannie, bicauſe he condemneth vs, and appoynted vs to be puniſhed for the things we doe by compulſion through the neceſſitie of his predeſtination.
               
               Marke here by the way, how al rulers be charged wyth tyrannie for puniſhing of male factors, firſt graūt thys propoſition which he affirmeth: That al offenders, as murderers, theues and traytours, cōmit their offences by the compulſion of predeſtination. Secondly, this aſſumpted minor (which he alſo affirmeth) that it is tyranny for one whych is an inferior power, and not theyr creator, to puniſh them which do commit crimes by ſuch compulſion. Then muſt it needes follow, that al rulers are tyrants which puniſh malefactors, and are no creators, but inferior powers, bicauſe all malefactors could not choſe but commit ſuch wicked offēces, being driuen therevnto by compulſion, through the neceſſitie of predeſtination.
               Wo worth the ſinful generatiō of our age, which hath bred and brought forth ſuch a noiſome noueltie, and ſtraunge Paradox, to whom the handes of Gods mercie are ſtretched out all the day long: and yet they are euer defying him to the face, as the Prophete ſayth. Eſay. 65. Conſider I deſire thee, not the perſons of them that ſpeake, be they neuer ſo high, neuer ſo wiſe, neuer ſo many, but marke the opinion it ſelfe: euen in thy conſcience, and in the ſight of of God, whether any thing may be ſpoken more repugnant to the nature of God, more contrarie to the word of God, more defacing the iuſtice and mercie

of God, than to ſay, that God puniſheth man with the torments of Hel, in euerlaſting fier, for doing thoſe thyngs whych he himſelfe hath predeſtinate, ordeyned, decreed, determined, appoynted, wylled and compelled hym to do: and that whych a man can not chooſe but muſt needes doe, by the force and compulſion of hys predeſtination.
               All which thyngs in thoſe playne termes, they moſt euidently teach in diuers partes of theyr wrytings, but of all other this is moſt odious and horrible, where they affyrme that men ſinne by compulſion, through the neceſſitie of Gods predeſtination.
               And the verie ſame ſayth Knoxe in the. 317. ſide of his booke, before named, affirming likewyſe in thoſe playne termes: that the wycked are not onely left by Gods ſuffryng, but compelled to ſinne by power, and he citeth it as the ſaying of Auguſtine agaynſt Iulian. Lib. 3. Cap. 5. But very falſly (as I ſuppoſe) for I haue ſought the ſame place in Auguſtine, and he hath neyther thoſe words, neyther any ſuch like, that import the ſame or any like matter.
               Wherefore, till ſuch time as they make better proufe: I muſt thinke that they haue forged a lye in Auguſtines name, ſuppoſing thereby to giue Authoritie to falſhode. But to cōclude, whether it were the ſaying of Auguſtine, or not, you ſee it is plainly their opiniō, not only that men can not chooſe, but do what wickedneſſe or miſchief ſoeuer they do, but alſo they are compelled wyth the power, force, or compulſion of Gods predeſtination, to commit all thoſe euils and wicked crymes, for the whych they are executed wyth the temporall ſworde, or damned with euerlaſting torment.
            
            
               
               Crowley.
               It doth here manifeſtly appeare, that Cerberus hys chiefe quarrell is againſt Crowley. For though there be other that haue written as plaine, and as open matter for the neceſſitie of Predeſtination as I haue, and to ſay the truth more plaine too: yet doth Cerberus lay the matter to no man charge ſo often & ſo openly as he doth to mine. For this is nowe the fift tyme y• he hath made playne mention of mée in this his ſhort aunſwere to hys friendes Letter. No maruell therefore, though the malice of his minde, doe ſometimes cauſe him to miſconſter my wordes and writings, as in this place he doeth, placing my wordes ſo in this his aunſwere, that they ſéeme to haue a manifeſt meaning farre differing from that which they haue in y• place where I wrate them in mine aunſwere to Shaxton. Firſt he ſayth, y• vſing the terme of driuing, I haue ſayde, that Gods Predeſtination hath driuen them to it. Now (Gentle Reader) I muſt make thée iudge of the meaning of theſe wordes, in the place where they ſtande written by mée.
               After I had declared, that the Adminiſtration of the common weale by publike Miniſters, lawes and ordinances, coulde not be other than profitable, and alwayes redounding to the glorie of God, notwithſtanding that the hauing of ſuch miniſters and miniſtratiōs, is a thing that commeth to paſſe of neceſſitie and can not but be: I laboured to make the matter more plaine by certain queſtiōs, wherof this is one. How could it haue bene, that ſo great and rude multitudes of barbarous nations, ſhould haue ſubmitted themſelues, to be vnder lawes & rulers: had not Gods Predeſtination driuen them to it?
               Here be the words in that order y• I firſt wrate them.

Nowe iudge (gentle Reader) whether Cerberus meant ſimply, when he cited them thus: He ſayth, that Gods Predeſtination hath driuen thē to it. Adding ſuch words immediately after, that it might ſéeme that I had ſpoken theſe wordes in no ſuch meaning: but rather, that my whole meaning had bene, to affirme ye God doth by his Predeſtination, forcibly driue men to do the things that they are damned for. For he ſaith, that I ſay: We are cō
                  pelled by the neceſſitie of Goddes Predeſtination, to doe thoſe things, for which we are damned. And then to ſet a ſhew of indifferēce vpon his doing, as though he meant nothing leſſe than to applie my wordes otherwiſe than my meaning was, he ſayth, that he will repeate ye whole ſentence, in this maner. To this muſt we aunſwere. &c. As though the aunſwere that I make, were but an aunſwere to mine own words, which I haue before affirmed.
               But ye thou mayſt ſée (gentle Reader) what wordes they he that I doe there make aunſwere vnto: I will ſet them downe here in writing, as they ſtande in my booke againſt Shaxton. They are theſe.
               
                  Well, here followeth yet another inconuenience, and that is this. If all things be done of neceſſitie: Why ſhould any man be blamed for miſſedoing? Why ſhould any man be damned, ſithens all they do is but the ordinaunce of God, and that more is, they can not auoide the neceſſitie, wherby they are conſtrayned to do al that they do. Wherfore if they ſhould endeuour to refrain the euil yt they do, it were but al in vaine, for they are predeſtinated eyther to do it, or elſe to leaue it vndone. Iuſtly therfore can they not be condemned, bicauſe the euill they do, is not of themſelues, but of the ordinance of God.
               
               And then follow the wordes that Cerberus hath cyted. But when he commeth to thoſe wordes that myght ſome thing ſhewe my meaning to be otherwyſe than he

would haue it ſéeme to be: he ſtayeth. I will therefore ſet downe thoſe wordes which doe immediately followe, which are theſe. But foraſmuch as he is ſubiect to no ſuperiour power, and we be all his treatures: ſo that to what ende ſoeuer he haue framed vs, we are his inſtruments to doe the work that he hath appointed to be done: why ſhoulde we ſtande vp and reaſon with him to know his purpoſe in creating vs, or why he made vs to this or that faſhion? to this or that vſe? to be precious or vils? For this one thing we may be ſure of, that God hath by his eternall wiſedome, created nothing, nor appointed nothing to be done, but the ſame ſhall redounde to hys glory in the ende: ſéeme it neuer ſo contrarie in ye meane time. Let vs hearken to the words of S. Paule to ye Romanes Rom. 9. in this matter. What if God (ſayth he) willing to ſhew. &c.
               Here thou mayeſt ſée (gentle Reader) what malice may doe. I ſayde that ſo many barbarous and rude nations woulde neuer haue ſubmitted themſelues to liue vnder lawes, if Goddes Predeſtination had not driuen them to it: meaning that God in hys wyſedome & euerlaſting prouidence, had appointed that all multitudes of peoples ſhould be gouerned by lawes and orders, and to bring thē thereunto, he vſed ſuch meanes, that they were driuen to chooſe rather to liue vnder lawes, and ſo to continue and flouriſh, than to liue without lawes, and ſo decay and come to naught. But Cerberus doth maliciouſly conſter my wordes, as though my meaning were, driuen to be vnder lawes, as ſhepe are driuen from the paſture to the folde. But I ſpake of men, and not of brute beaſts. We vſe to ſay that men are driuen, ſome by feare, ſome by frendſhip, ſome by affection, ſome by infirmitie, and ſome by pouertie and néede: and yet in all theſe caſes, we meane not that man hath not a will which conſenteth

to the thing that he doeth: but that the will of man is by theſe meanes induced to chooſe that which it conſenteth vnto, and to leaue the other which it refuſeth to do. Againe, in anſwering the inconuenience that Cerberus & ſuch as he is, do ſay wil enſue vpon the doctrine of ye neceſſitie of Gods predeſtination: I ſayd: If God were an inſerious to any ſuperiour power, or if we were of another creation, and not of his making: then might we charge him with tyrannie, bicauſe he condemneth vs, and appointeth vs to be puniſhed for the things we do by compulſion. Not meaning (as Cerberus doth maliciouſly affirme that I do meane) that man is cōpelled by force without the conſent of his will, to do thoſe actions which God doth condemne him for, and appoint him to be puniſhed for: For that were to denie God to be God, and man to be man. For God is not God, vnleſſe he be both iuſt and mercifull. But there ſhoulde appeare in him neyther mercie nor iuſtice, if he ſhould vſe ſuch compulſion, as Cerberus would haue me ſeeme to teach. And if man ſhould be ſo ſpoyled of the libertie of his will, that he ſhoulde be compelled to do actions without all conſent of will: then were man ſpoyled of his principall part, which is his reaſonable ſoule, without which he is not, neyther can be thought to be man.
               I am not ſo beaſtly therefore, as to ſpeake of ſuch a compulſion. But I ſpeake of the ſame that Knoxe ſpake of in the place that Cerberus citeth, I now, for I dare not aſſirm vpon his word, neither haue I ſéene the booke my ſelfe. But the matter that Cerberus ſayeth Knoxe hath cited out of S. Auſten. I haue ſéene in S. Auſtē, not in the. 3. booke and, 5. chapter againſt Iulian: but in the. 5. booke and. 3. chapter againſt the ſame. Bylike Cerberus had little leyſure and leſſe luſt to reade S. Auſtēs words. & therefore not finding them at the firſt chop, he thought

it ſhould be enough for hym to ſay, that he muſt thinke that we haue forged a lie in S. Auſtens name. But to put thée out of doubt, gentle Reader, that Cerberus hys thought is a lying thought: I wil ſet downe S. Auſtens wordes in writing, and requeſt thée to reade the reſt of that Chapter, wherein I haue founde them writtē. And then I doubt not but thou wilt conſent to that compulſion that I haue ſpoken of.
               The wordes of S. Auſten are theſe. Quid est autem 
                  August. lib. 5 Cap. 3. contr. Iulian. 
                  quod dicis, cum deſiderijs ſuis traditi dicuntur, relictiper patientiam intelligēdi ſunt, nòn per potentiam in peccata compulſi: quaſi nòn ſimul poſuerit haec duo idem Apostolus, & patientiam & potentiam, vbi ait. Sic autem volens Deus ostendere iram, & demonstrare 
                  Rom. 9. 
                  potentiam ſuam, attulit in multa patientia vaſairae, quae perfecta ſunt in perditionem. Quid horum tamen dicis eſse quod ſcriptum est? Et Propheta ſi errauerit, & locutus fuerit, ego 
                  Ezechi. 14. 
                  Dominus ſeduxi Prophetam illum, & extendam manum meam ſuper eum, & exterminabo eum in medio populi mei Iſrael: Patientia est, an potentia? Quodlibet eligas, vel vtrum
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      fatearis: vio des tamen falſa Prophetantis peccatum eſse, poenam
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      peccati. An & hic dicturus es quod ait. Ego Dominus ſeduxi Prophetam illū, intelligendum eſse, deſerui: vt pro eius meritis ſeductus erraret? Age vt vis. Tamèn eo modo punitus est propeccato, vt falſum prophetando peccaret. That is to ſay: What is the meaning of thy wordes, when thou ſayeſt, that thoſe men that are ſaid to be giuen ouer to their owne luſtes, muſt be vnderſtande to be left by patience or ſufferance, and not cō
                  pelled or thruſt into ſinne by power: as though that ſame Apoſtle did not ſet downe both theſe two, both ſufferance and power, when he ſayeth. And ſo God being willing to ſhew forth his wrath, and to ſet forth his power, hath in much patience brought hyther the veſſels of wrath, which were made méete for deſtruction. And yet, whether of theſe things doeſt thou ſay that that is which

is written? And if a Prophet do erre and ſpeake lies: I the Lord haue ſeduced that Prophet, and I will ſtrotch out mine hand vpon him, and I wil vtterly roote him out from amongſt my people of Iſraell. Is this ſufferance, or power? Which ſoeuer thou doeſt chooſe: or if thou graūt both: yet doeſt thou ſée, that the falſe prophecie is ſinne, and the puniſhment of ſinne alſo. Wilt thou here alſo ſay, that where he ſayth, I the Lord haue ſeduced that Prophet: it muſt be vnderſtand, I haue left him, that being ſeduced according to his owne deſeruings, he he might erre? do as thou wilt. Yet is he in this ſort puniſhed for his ſinne: that by prophecying a lie he might ſinne.
               Nowe, I trow, Cerberus will not ſay, that Knoxe hath forged a lye in S. Auſtens name, ſuppoſing thereby to giue authoritie to falſehod. And if Cerberus woulde take the paines to reade the whole Chapter wherin theſe words of Auſten are written: I doubt not but he ſhould vnderſtand how God may by power cōpel men to ſinne, and yet puniſh them iuſtly for their ſinne, which they cō
                  mit by ſuch compulſiō. For they are not compelled without the conſent, yea the frée conſent, of their owne will.
               But leaſt Cerberus ſhould thinke, that not being able to aunſwere that which he concludeth vpon my wordes, I haue ſlily ſlipped it ouer: I muſt ſay ſome thing to that wherewith he chargeth me. That is, the charging of all Magiſtrates with tyrannie, for that they, not being Creators, do punyſh men for thoſe offences that they cō
                  mit by compulſion. He frameth an Argumēt againſt me, the maior propoſition whereof is not affirmed by me (as Cerberus ſayth it is) for I haue not in any place writtē, that theues, murderers. &c. doe commit theyr offences by the compulſion of predeſtination: but by compulſion, thorow the neceſſitie of predeſtination, meaning that cō
                  pulſion

and neceſſitie that S. Auſten ſpeaketh of in the places that I haue before cited out of his workes, which is not without the frée conſent of the will.
               The minor (which is, that it is tyrannie for one that is an inferior power, and not their Creator, to puniſh them that do commit crymes by ſuch compulſion) I do not in any part of my writings affirme. Wherefore Cerberus doth me open wrong, to conclude that I charge al rulers with tyrannie.
               The rulers are commaunded of God (who is theyr Rom. 
                        •
                     3. ruler, and to whom they ſhal render an accompt of their doings) that they ſhall puniſhe the breakers of Gods cō
                  maundements, and to that ende hath God giuen them a ſword. Woe vnto them therefore, if they do not punyſh ſuch, and defend the innocent. And when they do puniſh the offenders, and defend the innocent: then do they their dutie. So far of do I thinke them to be from the fault of tyrannie.
               But Cerberus woulde fayne haue the Rulers angrie with vs, and eſpecially with Crowley. And therefore he laboureth to make thē beleue that Crowley ſaith that which he neuer thought. The words that Cerberus hath cited out of my booke againſt Shaxton, when they be indifferently weyghed, ſhall be found none other in effect, than are thoſe wordes that Eſaie wrate in the. 45. Chapter of his Prophecies, where he ſayeth thus: Vae 
                  Eſai. 45. 
                  contendenti cum ſictore ſuo. Testa cum testis terrae contendat. An dicet lutum ſictori ſuo, quid facis? & opus tuum manibus destituitur. That is to ſay. Wo be to him that doth contende with his maker. Let the earthen veſſell contende with the earthen veſſelles. Shall the claye ſaye vnto him that made it: what dueſt thou make? and thy worke is not made with handes?
               What other thing can Eſaie meane by theſe words:

but that as it is a thing farre vnſéemely for a piece of clay to ſtand vp and reaſon with him that tempereth it with his fingers, and to ſay vnto him, why doeſt thou faſhion me after this ſort: ſo is it vnſéemely that man ſhould reaſon with God, concerning his purpoſe in making him after this faſhion or that, or to this vſe or that vſe? But if man wil reaſon this matter: let him reaſon it with him y• is a man as he is: ſo were there ſome reaſon in his doings. For although one man haue by Gods ordinance, authoritie ouer other men: yet may not that man do with the reſt what he luſteth, as God maye doe with his creatures.
               Wherfore, I conclude, that Cerberus his exclamation, with woe worth the ſinfull generation of our age. &c. is not worth the weighing, neyther would Cerberus if he had ſéene thus much before, haue thought it worth the writing as I ſuppoſe.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               Againſt which errour crieth out the word of God in a multitude of places: manifeſtly prouing, that through the grace & helpe of God, mē may chooſe, and are neyther driuen by abſolute neceſſitie, nor compelled by Gods Predeſtination, to commit murder, theft, treaſon or any ſuch flagitious offence, nor any maner of ſinne or euill, whatſoeuer it be. As for example: Moyſes ſayth: Therefore chooſe life. Deut. 30. And Ioſua ſayeth, chooſe whome you will ſerue. And after when the people promiſed to ſerue the Lord only, he ſayth vnto them, you are witneſſes vnto your ſelues, that ye haue choſen the Lord to ſerue him. Ioſua. 24. But afterward when the people forſoke the Lord agayne, and choſe other Gods: the

Lord ſayth vnto them. Goe, crie vnto the Gods which ye haue choſen. Iud. 10. Chriſt ſayeth, Marie hath choſen hir that good part, which ſhall not be taken from hir. Luc. 10. Dauid ſayth: I haue choſen the way of truth: and againe in the ſame Pſalme: I haue choſen thy commaundements: Pſalm. 119. But the Lord ſaith by his Prophet Eſay: They did wickedneſſe before mine eyes, and choſe the thyng that pleaſed me not. Eſay. 65. and in the next chapter he ſayth. Et elegerunt quae ego nolui. And they haue choſen thoſe things whych I would not. Eſay. 66.
               Thus it is playne, that as chooſe, and can not chooſe agree together, ſo doth their opinion agree wyth the Scripture, for ſuch direct contrarietie is betwene choiſe and meere neceſſitie, betwene violēt compulſion and chriſtian libertie, that blacke and white, may wyth more poſſibilitie, be coupled in a ſubiect.
               But it is maruell to ſee, how ſcrupulous ſome mē are in theſe wordes of choyſe. I doubt whether they dare read theſe & many ſuch like places of ſcripture, which ſo plainly ſpeake of choyſe: But perhap they alway skip ouer that word, or reade ſome other in ſteade therof, as the Iewes do Adonai in ſteade of Iehouah, for ſurely manie are ſo afrayde of freewill, that they fall as the Prouerbe ſayth, out of the lime Kell into the cole pit, from high preſumption into depe deſperation, fiercelie following that olde ſpirite of wicked Pelagi, as before it is touched in the .ix. of his diueliſh errors, where he affirmeth, that if a mā haue neede of Gods helpe, then hath he no freedome or choyſe at all: Thus do they breake theyr ſhippe vpon the perillous rocke, ſeeking to eſcape the daungerous Hurlepole. For an horrible preſumption it

was of Pelagius, to thinke that a man by nature, had ſuch power to chooſe good, and refuſe euill, that he needed not the grace and helpe of God: and a deſperate opinion is this of other, to ſay that the predeſtination of God worketh all things in man, whether it be good or euill, and that a man can not chooſe, but do whatſoeuer he doth. For no doubt, thys opinion maketh a verie diſordered Chaos, and an vtter cōfuſion of al thyngs, as it were mixing & thruſting together, both heauen, earth and hell. Making one confuſed lumpe, of God, the Diuell and the world. Of ſinne, grace, and nature, turning all doings into dreames, all trueth into traunces, all veritie into ſables, all prayer and meditation into vaine imagination.
               For if Gods predeſtination be the onlie cauſe of Adams fall and filthie ſinne, and conſequently the onely cauſe and worker of all euill, yea euen wyth compulſion & ſorce, as they ſhamefully and plainly affirme, then will no man denie, that on the other ſide: Gods predeſtination worketh as violently in all thyngs that are good.
               So then if Gods predeſtination work all, without all exception, both in euill and good, then all other things, whatſoeuer they be, although they appeare to worke, and doe ſome thing, yet doe they in dede vtterly nothyng. So that the Diuell doth nothyng, man doth nothing, lawes do nothing, doctrine doth nothing, prayer doth nothyng: but Gods predeſtination doth altogether, & is the efficient cauſe, yea and, the only cauſe of all thyngs.
               Agaynſt thys opinion, the worde of God is exceding playne and manifeſt, not only in the places before rehearſed, but alſo in theſe folowing, here briefly

noted, yea and abundantly throughout the whole Scripture. Gene. 4. a. Reg. 24. b. 1. Para. 21. b. Pro. 3. d. Eccle. 15. c. 4. Eſd. 7. b. d. &. g. e. &. 9. a. Luk. 10. d. &. f. Ioā 1. b. Act. 5. a. 1. Cor. 7. g. &. 9. a. &. 10. c. &. 14 f. 2. Cor. 13. c. Phil. 4. c. Heb. 11. Againſt this euill opinion, alſo doe all the auncient Doctors wyth one cō
                  ſent vehemently write, as they by themſelues cannot denie, except only Auguſtine, whych bicauſe of his exceeding obſcuritie and darkeneſſe in diuers places, he is often alleaged of both partes.
               Alſo againſt this opinion, writeth earneſtly Philip Melancthon the chiefeſt and beſt learned of all the Germaines: In like maner doth Bullenger, the chiefeſt and moſt excellent of all the Switcers. The ſame doth alſo Eraſmus Cercerius, and manie other of the beſt learned Proteſtantes, whoſe ſayings were profitable here to rehearſe, but that theyr iudgemēt in thys matter is well knowen to all the learned, and my determination is at this preſent, rather briefly and ſimplie, to declare what part of doctrine I and many other miſlike, than wyth long diſcourſe and manie authorities to diſproue the ſame.
            
            
               Crowley.
               In a multitude of places (ſayth Cerberus) the worde of God cryeth oute againſt the doctrine of the neceſſitie of Gods Predeſtination: manifeſtly prouing that, through the grace and helpe of God, men may chooſe, and are neyther driuen by abſolute neceſſitie, nor compelled by Gods Predeſtination, to commit murder, thefte. &c. As for example, Moyſes ſayth. Deut. 30. Chooſe lyfe. &c. Haue I ſayde that man is driuen by abſolute neceſſitie? Or that he is compelled by the compulſion of Gods Predeſtinatiō
                  
to commit murder, theft. &c? I am ſure Cerberus is not able to ſhewe it, in any of my writings. And I think he hath not ſéene it in anye of the writings of them that he writeth againſt.
               But this is his maner, when we ſpeake of ſuch a kind of neceſſitie as followeth vpon the preſcience of GOD, which can not be deceiued: then will he make y• worlde beleue, that we affirme an abſolute neceſſitie, wherein the will wreſteling and ſtriuing to the contrarie, is enforced to giue place, and violently driuen to doe that it woulde not: And when we ſpeake of that compulſion, that God vſeth in deliuering the wicked and obſtinate ſinners into a reprobate ſenſe, to commit things that are vnſéemely: that by ſinning, their former ſinne might be puniſhed: then Cerberus woulde haue men to beleue y• we meane of a violent compulſion, which man ſtriueth againſt, but is not able to reſiſt the force & violence of it.
               Wel, I doubt not but the indifferent Readers of this Apologie, will haue a better opinion of vs than ſo. For it doth plainely appeare by the words hereof, that we teach no ſuch neceſſitie, violent driuing, nor compulſion.
               But we ſaye, with the Scripture, and auncient and all ſounde Fathers: that Gods preſcience, prouidence, & Predeſtination, can not be diſapointed, but muſte néedes come to paſſe, as he hath foreſeene, and in prouidence predeſtinated that it ſhoulde: and yet not without the conſent of the wyll, in thoſe whome God did knowe before woulde conſent, and in foreknowledge did appoint to conſent, and to chooſe the things which he knewe before that they woulde chooſe.
               The Scriptures therfore, that Cerberus citeth out of Moiſes, Ioſua, Iudges, Dauid and Eſaie: are nothing againſt vs, for we confeſſe as much as is taught by them. We confeſſe alſo, that man may by the grace and helpe

of God chooſe to refuſe murder, theft, &c. What is it then that Cerberus hath ſayde againſt vs? He woulde faine haue men think that we teach, that God is not able with his grace and helpe to make men able to refuſe y• which is euill, and to chooſe to do that which is good. As though we ſhould think no better of our God, than the heathen Poets did of their Iupiter. Whome they bring in, lamenting that he was by the deſtinies letted ſo, that he coulde not doe that good for his deare children, y• he would gladly haue done for them. But we knowe, that our God is able to doe what he will doe, and that he is preſent in all places, and doth in all places al that he is willing to doe. Yea, we doe confeſſe with S. Paule, that by Phil. 4. his helpe that doth comfort & ſtrengthen vs, we are able to doe all things. So farre are we from thinking, that man is not, or may not be able by Gods helpe to refuſe to commit murder. &c.
               But Cerberus ſayth it is playne, that as chooſe and can not chooſe doe agrée togither: ſo doth our opinion agrée with the Scripture. And then he ſetteth méere neceſſitie and violent compulſion, againſt Chriſtian libertie. That doctrine may be his owne. We refuſe it as none of ours. But if Cerberus would come to talke: a man might aſke him in what pointes the Chriſtian libertie doth conſiſt. Whether he meane that it conſiſteth in an abſolute power to do what we will, bicauſe he maketh mere neceſſitie and violent compulſion, the contraries to it. If he meane ſo, then doth he not meane as S. Galat. 5. Paule doth meane in his Epiſtle to y• Galathiās, where he exhorteth them to ſtande in that libertie wherewith Chriſt hath made vs free: As may well appeare to as many as will reade the Text. Well, I will leaue thys matter, tyll I may knowe Cerberus and talke with him mouth to mouth.
               
                  
As for thoſe that be ſo ſcrupulous in the wordes of choyſe, let them (if there be any ſuch) aunſwere for themſelues. For my parte, I can be well contented to reade them and heare them too: but to apply them as Cerberus doth, I think no man can be to ſcrupulous, that will not agrée with Cotta, who woulde rather that God ſhoulde not know of things before they came to paſſe, than that man ſhould not haue frée choyſe to doe what he will. And yet do I not follow the ſpirit of Pelagius: as I haue ſhewed before vpon that ninth Article that Cerberus ſpeaketh of: neyther haue I, in ſéeking to eſcape the daungerous Hurlepoole, daſhed my ſhippe againſt the perillous Rocke, as Cerberus woulde haue men to thinke that I and ſuch other haue.
               But if Gods predeſtination be the cauſe. &c. Then, ſaith Cerberus. &c. This (if) is alreadie aunſwered. I wil not therfore trouble the Reader with it any more.
               But if Gods predeſtination worke all: then the Diuell, man, lawes, doctrine, and prayer, do nothing. Thys is the very reaſon that Cotta and Cicero made (as S. Auſten declareth in his ſyft booke De Ciuitate Dei. Cap. 9.) And in the tenth Chapter of the ſame booke, he doth aunſwere this obiection, declaring to what vſe, lawes, doctrine and prayers do ſerue. His wordes are theſe: Malè autem viuitur, ſi de Deo nòn benè creditur: Vnde, abſit à nobis eius 
                  August. De Ciui. Dei. lib. 5. Cap. 10.

The life of man is euill, when his beliefe concerning God is not good. Wherefore, be it far from vs, that we, to ye end that we our ſelues woulde be frée, ſhould denie the preſcience of him, by whome we are or ſhalbe frée. Therfore, lawes, reprehenſions, exhortations, commendations, and ſharpe rebukes, are not in vaine: bicauſe that both he did knowe before hand that they ſhoulde come to paſſe, and alſo they are of great force, euen of as great force as he did foreknow that they ſhould be. And iuſt rewardes are appointed for good workes, and puniſhments for ſinnes. Neyther doth man ſin, bicauſe God did knowe before that he ſhoulde ſinne. Yea rather, it is therfore out of doubt that he doth ſinne, when he doeth ſinne: bicauſe he, whoſe foreknowledge can not be deceyued, did know before, that it was not deſtinie, nor fortune, or anie other thing, that ſhould ſinne, but he himſelfe. Which if he be not willing: he ſinneth not at all. But if he ſhould not be willing to ſinne: God did alſo know that before.
               Here may Cerberus ſée (as it were in a glaſſe) howe far vnlike S. Auſten he is in this matter: and how liuely he doth reſemble his olde friendes Cicero and Cotta. For feare of graunting anie neceſſitie to follow vpon ye preſcience and predeſtination of God: he will rather graunt that God may be deceyued, and that he is altogether careleſſe, and predeſtinateth nothing ſo certainely, but that man may by the power of his will alter and chaunge it. And this is in effect, as much as to denie that there is any God at all.
               But the worde of God is excéeding plaine and manifeſt againſt this opinion (ſayth Cerberus.) For Geneſ. 4. 2. King. 24. &c. are places moſt manifeſtly againſt it.

But al thoſe places I leaue to be weighed by ye Reader, who keping in minde that which I haue written in the former part of this Apologie, may eaſily vnderſtād how they make againſt that opiniō that we hold. And to giue the Reader ſome occaſion to conceyue a good opinion of Cerberus in the citing of his Scriptures for his purpoſe: I wil ſet downe the iudgement of his owne Auſten, in thoſe queſtions ex vtro
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      testamento, that Cerberus and I haue ſpoken of before: wherein ſhall appeare how that Auſten vnderſtandeth the firſt of Cerberus Scriptures, which he citeth out of the fourth of Geneſ. His words be theſe. Ita
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      nō quia obtulit reprehenſus eſt, ſed quia indigna obtulit. Ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ex co damnatus est, ſed quia factum noluit emendare cō
                     monitus. Adte enim ait conuerſio cius, & tu dominaberis cius. Hoc est, me nòn accipiente, ad tuum dominium conuerſum eſt munus à te oblatum, vt de caetero ſeiret quid faceret. That is to ſay: Therefore he was not rebuked, bycauſe he did offer a ſacrifice: but bicauſe he did offer thoſe things that were too vile to be offered. No, he was not condemned for that neyther: but bicauſe he would not amend his fact when he was told of it. For he ſayth, thine offering ſhal return to thee againe, & thou ſhalt be Lord of it. That is, where as I do not receyue thine offering, it is returned againe to thine own rule, ſo that he might know how he ſhould vſe the reſt.
               Nowe let the indifferent Reader iudge, howe thys place may by the iudgement of this Auſten: be applied as Cerberꝰ would here haue it to be applied. And if Cerberus will haue this place ſerue his purpoſe, he muſt ſight with his owne Auſten be he neuer ſo loth to do it. But leaſt this Apologie ſhould increaſe too much, and paſſe the quantitie that I would haue it to growe vnto: I wil leaue the reſt of the places that he citeth, to the conſideration of the diligent Reader, aſſuring the ſame, that not

one of thoſe places ſhalbe found to make againſt vs.
               All the auncient Doctors alſo (ſayth Cerberus) and the beſt learned of the Proteſtantes. &c. doe vehemently write againſt our opinion. And Auſten only bicauſe of his exceeding obſcuritie. &c. is alleaged on both parts. But when Cerberus ſhall cite their wordes that they haue ſo vehemently written againſt vs: there ſhall none of them be found to maintaine his opinion. Which is, that in Chriſt all mankinde is elected. As it appeareth in the former part of this Apologie. Neyther ſhall any of them be found to write againſt that which we maintaine, whē
                  their words and ours ſhal be well weighed, and our purpoſes perceyued, as all the learned may well vnderſtand and know, though Cerberus be blinde on that ſide.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               Wherefore, to conclude. Take thys one note, in this matter of cannot chooſe, or of neceſſitie, both for the better vnderſtanding of the thyng it ſelf, and alſo of thoſe which write therevpon.
               They commonly ſpeake of two kindes of neceſſitie. The one is, of neceſſitie abſolute, and the other, of neceſſitie of conſequence, or mere neceſſitie, and neceſſitie vpon condition, which diuiſion, all learned and good Authours do vſe, and it is verie profitable to be conſidered. For touching the one, there is neyther reaſon, law, counſell or doctrine, neyther fayre promiſe, nor ſharpe threatning, nor any other thyng whatſoeuer it be, which may helpe or hinder, adde or take away, hurt or profite. Wherfore, there is neuer any of al the aforeſaid waies or meanes vſed in any of all thoſe things, whych come to paſſe by abſolute neceſſitie.
               
                  
As for example: It is of meere neceſſitie, that the Diuell is and euer ſhall be damned, that the ſoule of man ſhalbe euerlaſting, and not come to an end, like to the liſe of beaſtes: nor the life of beaſtes be immortall as the ſoule of man, and ſuch like. Wherein it were more than madneſſe, to endeuour, eyther by reaſon, law, or counſell, or anie other way whatſoeuer it were, to alter, chaunge, withſtand or remoue anie of thoſe thyngs, ſeing of meere neceſſitie they muſt needes be ſo, and can not be altered.
               For as Auſtē ſaith: 
                     Omne enim quod prohibetur, ideo prohibetur, ne (quia potest ſicri) ſiat. Si autem fati eſset, nòn poſset fieri, ne
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                        , prohiberetur. Vet. & noui testamēt. Quest. 115. Whatſoeuer is forbidden (ſayth Auſten) therfore it is forbidden, bicauſe it might be done, and yet ought not to be done. But if it were of deſtinie, then could it not be done, nor ſhould not be forbidden.
               
               Theſe words of Auſten being few, conteine much matter, if they be truly weighed.
               Now to the neceſſitie of conſequence, or neceſſitie of condition, wherof Melancthon ſayth: Ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                     , enim haec conſequentia libertatem voluntatis tollit. Neyther doeth thys conſequence take away the libertie of the wyll. And thys neceſſitie is not repugnant to diligence, prayer, lawes and doctrine. For therfore (that I may vſe agayne the wordes of Auſten) thyngs are forbidden to be done, bicauſe they might be done, but ought not to be done. And thys neceſſitie groweth vpon former cauſes, graunted or wrought. As it is of neceſſitie, or needes muſt be, that ſectes and hereſies ſhall growe in the Church, bicauſe the wycked ſeeke their owne glorie, and Sathan ſtirreth theyr heartes, to imagine & ſet forth abhominable errors, wherin they ſerue the Diuell, wyth all the diligence

of their power. Wherefore, it muſt follow: that ſects and hereſies ſhall grow.
               Neyther doth this neceſſitie proue, that they could not chooſe but commit ſuch euilles: but ſeeing they do refuſe the light, and embrace the darkeneſſe, thys muſt neceſſarily follow, thys muſt needes be the end, that hereſie & much miſchief ſhal ſpring. Or as when a man preſently beholdeth with his eyes murder, theft, drūkenneſſe, or any other wickedneſſe, it muſt nedes be true, that ſuch things are committed according to that whych a man doth ſee plainly before hys eyes. Yet doeth it not follow, that thoſe wicked doers coulde not chooſe but commit thoſe outragious crimes. But ſeeyng that they do commit ſuch thyngs, it muſt needes be true by the neceſſitie of conſequence, that ſuch things are committed of them. Theſe two kindes of neceſſitie, doeth Auſten notably declare, how, & after what ſort they ſpring out of Gods predeſtination. Lib. De Praedest. Dei. Cap. 2.
               
                  Firſt of all (ſayth Auſten) it is horrible iniquitie to ſay, that God doeth predeſtinate anie thing: ſauing only that whych is good. But of predeſtinations, ſome be of bynding or of bondage, and other be of condition. Theſe are of iuſtice, and thoſe of power. And that it may be the more manifeſt, it ſhal be declared (ſayth he) by example, which are of binding and power: and whych are of condition and iuſtice. God created heauen and earth, ſunne and moone: Furder, he did foreordeyne or predeſtinate that the heauen ſhould euer be turned, and the vnmoueable earth ſhould be in place of a center vnto the turning heauen. The Sunne and Moone ſhould rule the day and night. The day & night ſhould ſuccede one another in certain times appoynted. Theſe

predeſtinations are of power and of bynding. For euerie one of thoſe thyngs aforeſayd: is ſo bounde vnto hys worke, by the predeſtination of God, that it can not be moued from the ſame. But God created man, and did predeſtinate him, that if he were obedient, and did abſteyn from the taſt of the forbidden apple: he ſhould liue, but if he were diſobedient, he ſhould abide the ſentence of death. Thys predeſtination is of condition and of iuſtice. For God before the fall of man, dyd not by the power of binding ſo predeſtinate him to die, that of neceſſitie he muſt nedes die, but vnder that cōdition, if he ſinned. Bicauſe therfore mā did ſin, it was a righteous thing, that he ſhould die. If he ſinned not, he ſhould not be boūd to death by any chayn of Gods predeſtinatiō.
               
               All theſe are the wordes of Auſten. And thys diuiſion, is often repeated and commended, by the beſt learned of the Proteſtantes.
            
            
               Crowley.
               Now Cerberus will ſhortly come to an ende. For he will conclude with one note in this matter of can not chooſe or neceſſitie. &c. And this note is of the two ſortes of neceſſitie, one abſolute, and the other of conſequence. Or méere neceſſitie and neceſſitie vpon condition. &c.
               And to make men beleue, that all that we doe, is to perſuade mē, that al things do come to paſſe of méere neceſſitie: he putteth for example the damnation of the Diuell, the immortalitie of mans ſoule, and the mortalitie of the brute beaſtes. As though the thoughts, words and déedes of men were like vnto theſe. And therfore it ſhould as little auaile, to vſexeaſon, law, counſell, doctrine, faire promiſes or threatnings, to pull men from euil thought,

words or déedes, and ſo from damnation, which doth neceſſarily follow vpō thoſe doings, as it were by the ſame meanes to goe about to make the Diuell a ſaued ſpirite, mans ſoule mortal, & the life of a brute beaſt euerlaſting.
               But we ſpeake not of that neceſſitie which is méere or abſolute: but we ſpeake of the other, which is of conſequence or condition. And therefore his Auſtens wordes are cited out of place (I ſaye his Auſtens wordes, bicauſe they are the words of the ſame Auſten that I haue noted before not to be the Biſhop of Hippoe) for theſe wordes of this Auſten are ſpoken of the thoughtes, wordes and déedes of men, which, though they do come to paſſe by a certaine neceſſitie, as God dyd without beginning foreſee that they ſhould: yet doth man vſe the libertie of his wil therein. For he doth neyther thinke, ſpeake, nor doe anie thing without the conſent of his will. And there is no impoſſibilitie in man, but that his thoughtes, wordes and déedes may be contrarie to that they are.
               As for example. There was no impoſſibilitie in Cerberus but that he might haue refrayned, both y• weiting, and publiſhing and caſting abroade of this aunſwere to his friendes letter. Neyther was it impoſſible for me to refraine from writing this Apologie. And Cerberus and I both haue herein vſed the libertie of our will. And yet did God foreſée & predeſtinate both his doings herein and mine. And as he did foreſée that we ſhould chooſe to do as we haue done: ſo did he alſo predeſtinate oure doings herein. So that chooſing to doe as God did foreſée and predeſtinate that we ſhould chooſe to doe: we haue done it by that neceſſitie that all learned Authours do call the neceſſitie of conſequence or condition.
               And God doeth foreſee, whether this Apologie ſhall perſuade Cerberus to be of one minde with vs or not. And if it ſhall be ſo: then hath God predeſtinated my labours

ſo that end. If not: then ſhall my labours ſerue to ſome other purpoſe that God knew before. And yet do I herein vſe the libertie of my wi
                     ••
                  , and ſo ſhall Cerberus. vſe his. For neyther of vs is or ſhalbe enforced to do that which our will would not haue vs do.
               This is all the matter that the wordes of Cerberus his Auſten do conteine, when they be truly weighed.
               As for the ſentence of Pelancthon, it maketh nothing againſt vs, for we ſpeake of the ſame neceſſitie that he ſpeaketh of: and we affirme with him, that it taketh not away the libertie of mans will.
               The ſame Melancthon, writing De neceſsario, in hys booke which he doth entitle Erotematum dialectices: ſayeth that there be foure ſortes of neceſſities. One abſolute. As that God is true, liberall, iuſt. &c. Another of deſinitions or demonſtrations: as a thrée cornered ſtone muſt of neceſſitie haue thrée corners, and vertue muſt néedes be a thing that agréeth with the rule of Gods will. The third is natural, in things which are ſo ordered in nature, that they can not otherwiſe be, in and by that order. But this neceſſitie may be altered at Gods pleaſure, as by examples we ſée it hath. As at the redde ſea when the water ſtoode ſtill on heapes like hilles, and when at the word of Ioſua, the ſunne ſtoode ſtil and moued not. &c. The fourth and laſt, is that which al the buſineſſe is about. And Cerberus would faine make all men beleue, that we make no difference betwéene this fourth and the firſt.
               Of this neceſſitie, doth Melancthon write thus. Quartus gradus est mutabilium, quae tamen vocantur neceſsaria, neceſsitate conſequentiae, id est, quae ſuns quidem re ipſa mutabilia: ſed nòn mutantur, vel quia ſic à Deo decreta ſunt, vel quia ſequū
                     tur ex cauſis, quae nòn mutantur, cum tamen mutari potuiſsēt, vel quia cum ſu
                        •
                     t, contradictoriae ſimul verae eſse nòn poſſunt. &c. That is to ſaye. The fourth degree of neceſſities, is of

thoſe things which are mutable, which are notwithſtanding called neceſſarie, by the neceſſitie of conſequence. That is to ſay, which are in déede mutable: but are not chaunged, eyther for that they be ſo decréed of God, or elſe for that they doe follow vpon cauſes that are not chaunged, where as notwithſtanding they might haue bene chaunged. Or elſe, for that when they be done, the fiat contraries of them, can not at the ſame time be true.
               What haue I written againſt Shaxton more than this? The thoughts, the wordes, and the déedes of men, are of themſelues mutable: but as God hath decréed, ſo ſhall it come to paſſe, in all mens thoughts, wordes and déedes.
               It followeth therfore, that though ye teachers of ſects, the muderers, the theues and the drunkerds, might haue withholden the conſent of their willes from thoſe wicked doings: yet God hauing decréed to puniſh eyther them or others by that meane, the thing muſt fal out according to that decree: and yet God remayne iuſt, and mans wil vnconſtrained, as I haue before ſufficiently declared.
               As touching the Text of Auſten, that Cerberus citeth out of his booke De Predestinatione Dei. Cap. 2. I will firſt note what Eraſmus and the reſt of the learned ſort, doe thinke of that booke. Hoc opuſculum de Praedestinatione Dei, nō eſse Augustini, vel ipſa breuitas arguit. Deinde, hoc docot, quod Augustinus fortiter refellit, praedestinationem eſse ex operibus nostris. Videtur fragmētum alicuius libri, cuius ſtudioſus quiſpiam, prooemium & clauſulam attexuit. That is to ſay. This little worke of the predeſtination of God: is by the verie ſhortneſſe thereof, ſhewed not to be of Auſtens writing. Moreouer, it doth teach that predeſtinatiō is of our workes, which thing Auſten doth mightely refell. It ſéemeth to be a ſcrap of ſome booke, wherevnto ſome man, beyng deſirous therof, hath faſtened a proeme and concluſion.
               
                  
Here thou mayſt ſée (gentle: Reader) of what authoritie this booke is, that Cerberus maketh ſo much of. I wil not therfore ſpend any time in aunſwering theſe words.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               Many things do offer themſelues in this matter to be ſpoken, but my purpoſe of briefneſſe cauſeth me to growe to an ende. I haue thought good therefore in few wordes, to note one point more of euill doctrine, which now a dayes is taught, and it ſpringeth alſo out of this foreſaid propoſition, that Gods predeſtination cauſeth all ſinne and wickedneſſe, & this it is, that ſinne is not the cauſe of Reprobation, nor of Gods hatred towardes the wicked which are damned, which thing in deede, to be ſhort, I graunt muſt needes follow, if the former concluſiō be true, that ſinne commeth of Gods predeſtination, or that Gods predeſtination was the cauſe of Adams fall, which was the originall of ſinne. For if ſinne, or the orignall thereof came of God, or of hys ordinance, and from God commeth nothing but that which is holie, iuſt and good, then is ſinne, no ſinne, and cannot be the cauſe of Gods hatred towardes them that periſh, except we ſhould ſaye, that God hateth them for that thing, which is holie, iuſt, and good.
               And leaſt I ſhould be thought, through pretence of breuitie, to paſſe ouer, wythout plaine proufe of that which I ſay, that thys part of doctrine, is alſo ſet forth and taught. I will rehearſe one ſentence of theirs publiſhed in print, which is ſo open and manifeſt, that it may ſerue as well as a thouſand: I read in the forenamed booke tranſlated out of French into Engliſh, toward the latter end of the booke, vppon

this place, thus noted in figures, and theſe verie words follow. Rom. 9. c. 11. 12. 13. He ſayth not onely that Eſau was ordeyned to be hated, before he did any euil: for in ſo ſaying, he ſhould not ſeeme to exclude any thing, but an actual ſinne & incredulitie. But he ſaith expreſſely, before he was borne: whereby he excludeth originall ſinne, and all that whych might be conſidered in the perſon of Eſau by hys byrth from the cauſe of hate.
               Touching the Text, whervpon it is ſpoken, aſſuredly Inke ſerueth not worſſe to make Iuorie white: than theſe words, to open the minde and ſence of the Apoſtle, as it were eaſy to proue, if ſhortneſſe would ſuffer to make a digreſſion, but touching that parte of doctrine: thou feeſt that he ſpeaketh of two opinions: the one that actual ſinne or incredulitie, ſhould be the cauſe of Gods hatred toward the wycked: The other, that originall ſinne, is the cauſe of Gods hate toward them. Thys man agaynſt them both, taketh occaſion vpon thys exāple of Eſau: to exclude all that is in man, eyther outward ſinne or inwarde, eyther originall ſinne or actuall, from the cauſe of Gods hate, ſo that (if it be true which they ſay) God doth hate men: neyther for their outward wicked life, nor for their inwarde diueliſh luſte, but for hys owne pleaſure onely.
            
            
               Crowley.
               The purpoſe to be briefe, cauſeth Cerberus to cut of many things that offer themſelues to be ſpoken. Yet for all the haſt, he muſt néedes note one poynt more of euill doctrine. Which is, that ſinne is not the cauſe of Reprobation. &c.
               
                  
I would faine know how Cerberus could aunſwere this Argument. All cauſes are in order before their effectes: but ſinne was not before Reprobation: Ergo ſinne could not be the cauſe thereof. Cerberus will denie the minor. For he holdeth that ſinne was before Reprobatiō. The minor therefore muſt be proued thus. Whatſoeuer was before Reprobation, is eternall: but ſinne is not eternall, Ergo ſinne was not before Reprobation. If Cerberus wil doubt of y• 
                  maior, it ſhal be proued thus. Whatſoeuer was before Electiō, is eternall: but Election and Reprobatiō are of like antiquitie: Ergo, whatſoeuer was before reprobation is eternall. The maior is manifeſt by the wordes of S. Paul to the Epheſians. Cap. 1. Sicut elegit nos in ipſo ante mundi constitutionem. As he elected vs in him before the worlde was made. And if Cerberus wyll doubt of the minor (as perhaps he will) then let him ſhew vs, how there can be a choyſe where none are refuſed.
               This might ſuffiſe for our deſence in this matter that Cerberus doth now charge vs withall. But bicauſe he ſayth that this our concluſion is the ſequele of a propoſition that we affirme, that is, that Gods predeſtination cauſeth all ſinne and wickedneſſe: I muſt take ſome what more paine in the defence of that which we haue written.
               Firſt, I muſt ſay that Cerberus hath belyed vs: For we ſaye not that Gods predeſtination doeth cauſe any ſinne. Then I muſt alſo denie, and haue alredie proued, that Adams fall was not the originall of ſinne. Thirdly, we denie that the originall of ſinne came of God: wherfore the concluſion that Cerberus maketh is not againſt vs.
               But Cerberus hath found one ſentence of ours ſo open and manifeſt, that it maye ſerue as well as a thouſand. It is in the latter ende of the forenamed Engliſh

booke tranſlated out of French, vpon the words of Paul Rom. 9. c. He ſaith not only. &c. Cerberus can not ſée how this Text of Paul may by thoſe words be better opened, than Iourie may be made white with ynke. But for haſt to come to an ende, he will not ſtande to proue this, although he might eaſely do it, as he ſayth.
               But touching the two opinions, one that actuall ſinne or incredulitie, the other that originall ſinne, is the cauſe of Gods hatred towardes men: this fellow (ſayth Cerberus) taketh occaſion vpon the example of Eſau to exclude all that is in man. &c.
               A little helpe woulde make this man of one minde with Origine, who writing vpon this parte of Paules Epiſtle to the Rom. and theſe verſe wordes, Iacob haue I loued, but Eſau I haue hated: ſaith, that Iacobs ſoule being yet without a bodie, did purge it ſelfe, and when God ſaw the pureneſſe of it, he tooke it, and put it into that bodie wherin Iacob was borne, and Eſau his ſoule which had not cleanſed it ſelfe, he put into a bodie made out of the ſame lumpe, but not to honour as the other was, bicauſe the ſoule of Eſan was not worthie of ſuch a bodie. So he loued Iacob (as Origine thinketh) bicauſe Iacobs ſoule had cleāſed it ſelf before it came into y• body: & he hated Eſay, bicauſe his ſoule had not cleāſed it ſelfe.
               If a man ſhould aſke this queſtion of Cerberus: why did God loue Iacob and hate Eſau? what could he aunſwere, if he wyll not ſay, Quia voluit? bicauſe he woulde, If he will ſaye, that God reſpected the actuall righteouſneſſe and ſinne that was in them: then ſhall he be found to ioyne with Origine. If he ſhall ſaye that he reſpected originall ſinne in Eſau, and did therfore hate him: then may it be aſked why he did not hate Iacob for the ſame. For both were defiled therwt alike. But if Cerberus wil ſay, that God had reſpect to ye workes that they ſhould do

in the time of their life; then doth he ioyne with the Papiſtes: And that he would not ſéeme to do.
               His beſt waye therfore, ſhalbe to ioyne with vs, and ſay: That God loued Iacob and hated Eſau, bicauſe it pleaſed him ſo to doe. And if any man ſhall ſtand vp to diſpute the matter any further: then to aunſwere with S. Paule. O homo tu quis es, qui respondeas Deo? O thou mā, who art thou, that dareſt take vpon thée to reaſon wyth God?
            
            
               Cerberus.
               That verie ſame thyng ſayth Knoxe in the. 141. pag. of hys foreſayd booke: where his wordes are theſe. Further I ſaye: that if Eſau was hated for his euill deſeruing, then muſt it needes follow, that Iacob was loued for hys well deſeruing, by the Argument following: of the nature of contraries.
               As well it might be ſaid, it muſt needes follow by the contraries: that if a King or Prince hate one mā, whych hath well deſerued his hate, by ſtealing from him his ring, his chain, or ſome great Iuel, thē doth he not loue any other man, but he whych hath well deſerued hys loue, by giuing to hym a ryng, a chain, or ſome great treaſure, as though he ſhould ſay: bicauſe iuſtice worketh on the one ſide, therfore mercie hath nothing to doe on the other ſide, or as though God were not both iuſt & mercifull: Iuſt in damning for their offence, thoſe which are damned: and mercifull in ſauing without their deſert thoſe which are ſaued.
               And who ſeeth not that neyther ſimile, nor diſsimile, neyther like thyngs, nor thyngs contrarie, do holde in all poyntes, for nothing is ſo like, whych in

ſomethyng is not vnlike, neyther any thing ſo contrarie, whych doth in all things varie. Chriſt is likened to a Lion, but did he euer rauiſh, or deuour, and ſhedde any innocent bloude? Latimer wyſheth, that al Byſhops were like Byſhop Diuell in diligence, thē ought not the Diuell and a Byſhop to differ in all thyngs. And moſt ſpecially and plainely, doeth the Scripture beate in our heads: aboue al other things, that the nature of contraries, doe not holde in both ſides of Gods reward, & mans deſeruing. For as they are inſeparable relatiues in the one part, ſo on the other ſide, the one hath neuer any relation to the other, for as Gods hatred and vengeaunce, hath euer relation to mans deſeruing: ſo hath Gods loue and mercie neuer any relation to mans merite. Yea, all the Scripture teacheth vs, that God neuer hateth, or puniſheth man wythout his owne deſeruing. For as the wyſe man ſayth: Et cum qui nullam poenam commeritus 
                  Sapient. 12. 
                  ſit cōdemnaſse, a tua potentia iudicas alienum. And thou Lord (ſayth he) eſtemeſt it a thyng contrarie to thy power, to haue condemned him whych hath not deſerued puniſhment.
               What ſhould be ſayde of the Cananites and the Iſraelites, if the nature of contraries do alway hold, and haue ſuch relation of the one to the other, muſt it not then neceſſarily follow (as he ſayth) by the nature of contraries: that if the Cananites were caſt out of the fortunate land that floweth wyth milke and hony, for their euill deſeruing: that on the other ſide the Iſraelites were brought and planted into that ſame happie and bleſſed reſt, for their well deſeruing? But what ſayth the Scripture? Speake not in thy heart, after that the Lorde thy God hath caſt them out before thee, ſaying: for my righteouſneſſe Deut. 9.
                  
the Lorde hath brought me in, to poſſeſſe thys lande, naye, but for the wickedneſſe of thoſe Nations, the Lorde doth caſt them out before thee. So plainly ſpeaketh the holie ghoſt here, that thou mayſt eaſily perceyue, how groſſe and vayne their ſaying is, which affirme: That if God hate an euill man for his owne euill deſeruing, then muſt it nedes follow, that he loueth a good man for hys owne well deſeruing. For the hatred of God and euerlaſting damnation are iuſt rewardes of mans euil deſeruing: but the loue of God and euerlaſting life are free gyftes Rom. 6. of God, for Chriſtes ſake wythout any part of mans owne deſeruing.
               Take therefore this ſaying of theyrs: No ſinne neyther originall nor actuall, is the cauſe of Gods hate or eternal death, and put the ſame into the one ſide of the ballaunce, then take, and put into the other ſide, this ſaying of S. Paul to the Romanes: was Rom. 7. that then that was good, made death vnto me? God forbid, but ſinne was made death vnto me. Then wey both theſe ſayings together with the hand of good aduiſemēt, in the indifferent ballāce of vpright iudgement, and put not in aboue three graynes of wilful partialitie: thus ſhalt thou plainly ſee, that the Apoſtle agreeth farre better with the Maieſtie of God, and hath a much more reuerent opinion of hys iudgements, than theſe men haue, yea, thou ſhalt eaſily perceyue (whatſoeuer they ſay) that neyther Gods pleaſure, nor Gods ordinance, or predeſtinatiō, nor none other thing that is good, is made death, or the cauſe of Gods hatred, agaynſt any man, but ſinne is the very grounded cauſe, why God hateth, taketh vengeaunce, and puniſheth man by death and deſtruction, according to that which the ſame Apoſtle

ſayth: Death is the reward of ſinne. And the wordes Rom. 6. Oſee. 13. of O ſee are alſo manifeſt & plaine where he ſaith: O Iſraell thou doeſt deſtroy thy ſelfe, but in me onely is thy helpe. In which words of the holie ghoſt, thou ſeeſt how manifeſtly God doth, as it were purge him ſelfe, from being the cauſe or worker of mans deſtruction, ſo that the perdition and deſtruction of man, is altogether to be attributed vnto hym ſelfe: And God being cleare, neyther acceſſarie, nor partaker thereof, as the chiefe and hygh Iudge of heauen and earth, vnſpotted and wythout blame, gyueth the ſentence of euerlaſting death vpon man, for his own wicked deſeruing and offence.
               But on the other ſide ſayth God vnto man, in me only is thy helpe. In God onely, onely in God is our helpe and ſaluation, in him onely, and of him altogether, and not of our ſelues: commeth our ſaluation, and all whatſoeuer belongeth therevnto. The ſame is alſo ſet forth by all thoſe Scriptures, whych are before rehearſed, to proue that ſinne and euill, commeth not of Gods predeſtination, for vpon that concluſion dependeth alſo thys propoſition, that ſinne is not the cauſe of Reprobation, or of Gods hatred towards man.
            
            
               Crowley.
               Yet once againe hath Cerberus a ſnatch at Knoxe. Whether he do report his words truly or not, I knowe not: for I haue not ſeene that booke of his, neither haue I cauſe to thinke, yt al is Goſpel that Cerberus ſaith. Much more adoe than néedeth doth Cerberus make, to proue that an Argument à contrarijs, ſimile and diſsimile: doth not alwayes conclude neceſſarilie. For as he ſayth, who

ſéeth not, that they do not holde in all pointes? This therfore that Cerberus hath here written, is but dalliaunce, and as it were dauncing about the buſhe. The queſtiō is, whether the ſequele be good in the matter that Knoxe doth vſe it in, or not. We muſt therfore conſider the matter, and how Knoxe doth applie this maner of reaſoning to this matter. The matter therfore, is a queſtion moued concerning the cauſe why Eſau ſhoulde be hated of God, and Iacob beloued, before any of them had done eyther good or euill, yea and before they were borne, and therfore, before there could be in them any deſeruing at all. Now, Knoxe ſayth, that if Eſau were hated for his euill deſeruing: then muſt it néedes follow, by an Argument following of the nature of contraries, that Iacob was beloued for his well deſeruing.
               Nowe, I muſt thinke well of Knoxe, for I knowe hym to be not only learned but alſo godlie, and therefore not like to ouerſhoote himſelfe ſo farre, that he woulde ſtretch an Argument, taken out of the place of contraries, further than the nature thereof will ſuffer. I muſt thinke therfore, that he meant, that if God do in chooſing and refuſing, in louing and hating, reſpect nothing but the well deſeruing of one ſort, and the euill deſeruing of ye other (as the common opinion of the Papiſtes is) then it muſt néedes follow, by an Argument of the nature of contraries, that if he hated Eſau for his euill deſeruing, he muſt needes loue Iacob for his well deſeruing.
               If Cerberus be not ſatiſfied with this, let him looke for furder aunſwere at Knoxes owne hand, for he is yet liuing and able to aunſwere for himſelfe.
               As for the ſimilitude of a King or Prince, that Cerberus vſeth to deface Knoxes Argument withall: may ſerue him among ſuch as know not that God is frée frō al mens affections, and that he can not be moued to loue

vs the better for the giftes that we beſtow vpon him, nor the worſſe, for that we take from him and ſpoyle him of any treaſure that he ought to haue.
               The nature of God is not to hate but to loue. For S. Iohn ſayth, God is loue. And as the wiſe man ſayth, he 1. Iohan. 4. Sapient. 11. loueth all things that be, and he hateth none of the thinges that he hath made. Neyther hath he ordeined or made any thing, hating the ſame that he ordeyned or made. For in that he made or ordeyned them, they are all excéeding good. Wherefore, when we ſay, or when it is ſayd in the Scriptures, that God doth hate any of his creatures, (as it is ſaid that he hated Eſau) it is meāt that he loued not Eſau or thoſe other creatures, whome he is ſayde to hate, ſo well as he loued the others, of whome it is ſayd that he loued them.
               It can not be denied, but muſt néedes be confeſſed, that God loued al his creatures, in that he would make them ſome thing, where as before they were nothing, and in that he would giue them ſome part of that which is proper to himſelfe. For to be, is proper to God. And whatſoeuer hath any being: it hath the ſame of God. When God giueth a being to his creatures, he ſheweth that he loueth them: but when he giueth them an euerlaſting and bleſſed being, then he loueth them ſo, that the other loue in compariſon of that, ſeemeth but an hatred. And therfore it is ſayd that he hateth them, whom he appointeth not to that euerlaſting bleſſed being, but leaueth thē to themſelues, that in them he may haue occaſion to exerciſe his iuſtice, and by them to gyue occaſion to hys dearlie beloued to ſée and conſider the excéeding greatneſſe of his loue and mercie towardes them.
               But Cerberus ſéemeth to haue the whole Scripture on his ſide. For he ſayth, that all the Scripture teacheth vs, that God neuer hateth and puniſheth vs without our

owne deſeruing. Which ſaying, I graunt to be true, but not in that ſenſe that Cerberus would haue vs to vnderſtande it. For Cerberus woulde haue vs to thinke that God could not be compted iuſt, if he ſhoulde refuſe any man in whome there were not ſinne, that might moue God to refuſe him, and to that ende he citeth the wordes of the wiſe man. For this is his opinion, as it appeareth Sapient. 12. before, that in Chriſt all mankinde is elected, and ſo conſequently, that Eſau was elected in Chriſt. But by ſinne he made himſelf a reprobate, and was not refuſed before he ſinned.
               But let vs ſée, how this place of the wiſe man maketh for his purpoſe. The words are theſe, as Cerberus citeth them. Et cum qui nullam poenam commeritus ſit condemnaſse: a tua potentia iudicas alienum. And thou Lorde, eſtemeſt it a thing contrarie to thy power, to haue condemned him that hath not deſerued puniſhment. All the Scripture is nowe, by Cerberus, brought into a ſhort ſumme. For it is knit vp in leſſe than two lines, written in the .xij. Chapter of the booke of wiſdome.
               Of what authoritie that booke hath awayes bene thought to be: I thinke Cerberus is not ignorant. And how diuers readings there be of that place which he cyteth: I ſuppoſe he knoweth. The Tygurine Bible is it that Cerberus followeth. Other tranſlations there be, that differ from that, and from the olde alſo. The olde tranſlation hath it thus.
               
                  Cum ergo ſis iustus, iustè omnia disponis: ipſum quo
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      qui nòn debet puniri, condemnas, & exterum aestimas à tua virtute. That is. Foraſmuch as thou thy ſelfe art iuſt, thou doeſt diſpoſe all things iuſtly: him alſo that ought not to be puniſhed, thou doeſt condemne, and doeſt eſteeme him as one exiled from thy power or dominion. Bylike, when Cerberus cited this place, he ſuppoſed that no mā ſhould

ſée his booke, but ſuch as were not able to diſcerne Chalk from Chéeſe. What place can make more manifeſtly againſt him and for vs, than this place doeth? For by theſe wordes it is plaine, that though God do condemne him, that hath not by any déedes deſerued to be condemned: yet is God neuer the latter, iuſt, and doth diſpoſe all things iuſtly.
               Yea, and the circumſtance of the Text doth ſhew that this tranſlation is more nigh the meaning of the writer, thā is that which Cerberus followeth. For the ſentence going immediatly before, is thus. Ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      Rex, ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      tyrannus, in conspectu tuo inquirent, de hijs quos perdidiſti. That is: Neyther King nor tyrant, will in thy preſence make inquiſition for them that thou haſt deſtroyed.
               And the ſētence that doth immediatly follow, is thus. Virtus enim tua, iustitiae initium est: & ab hoc quod omnium Dominus es, omnibus te parcere facis. That is. For thy power is the beginning of iuſtice, and bycauſe thou art Lord of all, thou doeſt make thy ſelfe to ſpare all.
               But bicauſe there is ſuch diuerſitie of tranſlations in the Latine, and peraduenture Cerberus wyll ſaye he hath loked in the Gréeke, and findeth that the Tygurine tranſlation, which he followeth, is moſt agréeable to the Gréeke Text, out of which all our Latine tranſlations are taken. It ſhall not be amiſſe therfore to ſet downe the Gréeke Text, that ſuche as haue any ſkill therein, may iudge betwixt vs.
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . That is to ſay (ſo far as I am able to vnderſtād it) Thou being iuſt, doeſt diſpoſe all things iuſtly, cōmaunding to condemne ſtraunge from the land of thy power, him yt is not to be iudged ignominious. If any cā ſée any other meaning in this Gréeke text: I wil

not contende, for I ſée that many men of great learning, haue varied in opinion about the tranſlation therof.
               But graunt that Cerberus haue cited that tranſlation that is according to the true meaning of the Text: what hath he wonne thereby? Shall all the Scripture be on his ſide, bicauſe it is written in ye booke of wiſdom, that God eſtemeth it a thing contrarie to hys power (or more truly after the Latine Text that Cerberus citeth) a thing ſtraunge from his power, to condemne him that hath not deſerued puniſhment? I thinke not. For the booke of wiſedome, is of that ſort of bookes that muſt be made to agrée with ye Canonical bookes: the Canonicall bookes muſt not be enforced to agree with it: For it is Apokryphe, that is a booke permitted to be read priuatly, but not of ſuch authoritie that we may builde our fayth vpon euerie ſentence in it.
               But graunt that this booke were of as great authoritie as any other booke of Scripture is: ſhould we thinke that God might not iuſtly refuſe ſuch of his creatures as it pleaſeth him not to chooſe, vnleſſe the ſame creatures had firſt by ſinne made them ſelues vnworthie to be choſen? We muſt not reſtraine God of his libertie, to doe wyth his creatures what he himſelfe will. Neyther muſt we ſay or thinke, that any thing that he doth, is or can be other than iuſt, albeit that we can not vnderſtand howe the ſame ſhoulde be iuſt. We muſt therefore, wyth reuerend ſeare, ſeeke another meaning of thys place than Cerberus doth teach vs: let vs thinke therefore, that God ſpeaketh here of therecution of his iudgement, and not of election. And it ſhalbe good for vs to ſay always wyth S. Auſten, that the cauſe of Gods doings may be ſecrete, ſo Aug. Paulino Quest. 6. that we can not know them: but vniuſt they can not be.
               But Cerberus ſéemeth to himſelfe to haue gotten a great aduauntage by the example of the Cananites and

Iſraelites. The Cananites were driuen out for theyr ſinnes, and this was iuſtice: but the Iſraelites were put in their place without deſeruing, and that was mercie. Wherefore in refuſing, God worketh by iuſtice, and in chooſing, he worketh by mercie. As though there were no difference betwene chooſing and refuſing of creatures, and the vſing of them when they be choſen or refuſed. God chooſeth and refuſeth without reſpect of good or euill deſeruings: but he maketh not his refuſal knowen vnto men, till the refuſed haue by theyr ſinnes ſhewed them ſelues worthie to be refuſed. And though the choſen ſort, neyther do nor can ſhewe themſelues worthie for theyr good workes to be choſen: yet before they receyue the great bleſſing promiſed, they ſhewe themſelues by theyr workes, leſſe worthie to be refuſed than the other.
               And to this do the Scriptures that Cerberus hath cited out of Moſes, Paule, O ſée and the reſt: full well agrée. But it followeth not hereof that therefore God had not refuſed the wicked ſort before they ſinned.
               It is true, that death is the rewarde of ſinne: but it is not true that euerie one that ſinneth, receyueth that reward, for Chriſt came to ſaue ſinners, and the frée gift of euerlaſting life is beſtowed vpon ſuch ſinners, as were elected in Chriſt before the beginning of the world.
               It is true alſo, that man deſtroyeth himſelfe, by the frée conſent of his will, to do contrarie to the commaundement of God, & that his helpe and ſuccour commeth of God alone: & yet doth it not therfore follow, that no man is refuſed of God before he haue cōmitted ſinne, whereby he deſtroyeth himſelf. For when the elect were choſen in Chriſt, then were the reſt refuſed. For otherwiſe, it could not be an election, but a generall acceptation.
               As for the ſaying that Cerberus ſayth is ours, and would haue his friend to lay it in the one ſide of the ballaunce

againſt S. Paules wordes to the Romaines: I leaue to himſelfe to be weyed wyth the hand of good aduiſement. &c. And let him put in as many graines of wilfull partialitie as he will: for the ſaying is none of ours. For we teach, that ſinne is the cauſe of eternall death, in thoſe that be not Gods elect, and were it not that Chriſt hath waſhed his choſen ſlocke in his owne heart bloud: ſinne would be theyr deſtruction too.
               It is but for his owne pleaſure therfore, that Cerberus doth thus turne round after his owne tayle.
            
            
               Cerberus.
               And vpon the ſame Article dependeth alſo an other part of doctrine, which they teach, worthy to be miſliked of all men, as wel for that it importeth a ſophiſticall ſearch of bottomleſſe ſecretes, in the verie eſſence and nature of God, as alſo, for that it clearely withdraweth vs from Chriſt, the only ſtaie, and comfort of our weake conſcience, deliuered vnto vs in the word of God, for that they might be ſure to holde faſt the former principle, that all things come of Gods predeſtination, as running ſtreames out of a deepe fountaine. They affirme, that the free mercie of God in Chriſt, is but an inferiour cauſe of Election, and that we are taught to aſcende vnto a higher cauſe, as vnto the eternall purpoſe and predeſtination of God, which he determined onely in himſelfe. So ſayth the printed booke before named, tranſlated out of French into Engliſh.
               That ſame thing we reade alſo, lately ſet forth in Engliſh print, in the gloſe of the laſt trāſlated Bible. Rom. cap. 9. wyth theſe wordes. As the only wyl and purpoſe of God, is the chiefe cauſe of Election and

Reprobation, ſo his free mercie in Chriſt is an inferiour cauſe of ſaluation. &c.
               But for my part, I truſt in minde, neuer to aſcēd vnto that high cauſe of Election, and in heart neuer to taſte of that eternall purpoſe or predeſtination, which God hath determined only in himſelfe, without or aboue his free mercie, which is in Chriſt. For ſurelie, that eternall purpoſe, whych cometh not of Gods free mercie in Chriſt, is to deſtroy, and not to ſaue. Agayne, if that eternall purpoſe ſpring out of Gods free mercie, then is that free mercie of God, the chiefe cauſe, and not an inferiour cauſe why he purpoſeth to ſaue vs, for a great diſhonor it were to the mercie of God: to be put to an inferiour place, touching election and ſaluation of man. For if euer Gods mercie be aboue all, it is in the ſauing of miſerable man: and mercie there is not in God towarde man, but onely in Chriſt.
               Therefore S. Paule Epheſ. 3. b. calleth it the eternall purpoſe, which he purpoſed in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord: In Chriſt therefore was this eternall purpoſe, and for hys onely ſake, God the Father eternally purpoſed to elect and ſaue vs. Conſider and marke it well, whence commeth thys purpoſe or wyll of God to ſaue vs: but of his free mercie? If hys purpoſe to ſaue vs, ſpring out of his free mercie, why is then his mercie inferior to his purpoſe, or how is the fountaine inferior to the ſprings that come therof?
               Alſo, what may be ſayd in God at any time, or in any reſpect to be higher or greater than his mercie, ſeeing it is written, that his mercie is as great as him ſelfe. Eccleſiaſt 2. d. Yea, and moſt ſpecially it is ſo to be ſayd, that his mercie paſſeth all, when we ſpeak of this matter: For of thys it is written, that mercie Iacob. 2. b.
                  
reioyceth agaynſt iudgement, and why? all the iudgementes of God in thys behalfe are not to be compared vnto hys mercie, for though it were not true, whych Dauid ſayeth, that his mercie is aboue all his Pſal. 45. b workes, yet were it cleare, that in Election and Redemption and ſaluation of man, Gods mercie in Chriſt, hath euer the higheſt place: and thoſe which in the ſaluation of our ſoules, make the free mercie of God an inferiour cauſe, how baſe a roume will they aſſigne vnto hys free mercie, in nouriſhing and preſeruing our bodies. Let them reach as hygh as they can, I truſt to go no furder, but to hold me faſt by the euerlaſting mercie of God, and by the hemme of Chriſtes garment, for the Scripture deſcribeth God vnto me, wythout Chriſt as a wrathfull and moſte terrible Iudge, but in Chriſt, and for hys ſake, as a father whoſe wrath is pacified, and he well pleaſed, reconciled, agreed, and at one: and to ſpeak of a hygher cauſe or purpoſe, to elect and ſaue only in God, beſide or without this free mercie in Chriſt, or that Chriſt and Gods free mercie in hym, is not the chiefeſt cauſe which worked and obteyneth the decree, and purpoſe of God, to elect and ſaue, it is plainely nothing elſe, but to deny the mercy of God in election, reconciliation, redemption and ſaluation, by Chriſt, in Chriſt, and for Chriſt: As eaſily it may be perceyued, if a man do but weigh and conſider, what eternall purpoſe an Election, and a reconciliation is, ſeing Chriſt is our Aduocate, Mediator, Peace, Reconciliation & Atonement, as in theſe Scriptures following, and many other, it doth plainly appeare. Pſal. 84. a. Math. 1. a. Ephe. 1. a. 2. b. Rom 5. a. b. Coloſſ. 1. c. 2. Corin. 5 d. 1. Ioā. 2. a. Heb. 5. b. c. and. 7. a. b. c. d. e. 2. Timoth. 1. c.
               
                  
And although it be true according to the Scriptures, that God ſo loued the worlde, that he gaue his onely begottē ſonne. &c. yet did he neither loue the world, nor gyue hys ſonne wythout the interceſſion & mediatiō of his ſonne, for if God loued the world without the reconciliation and mediatiō, or before he was reconciled, intreated, and pacified by Chriſt, then is Chriſt in vaine come to late to be our mediatour, ſeing God the Father is without him alredy reconciled. But horrible falſe is thys opinion: For like as the ſonne of a King might entreat his Father for the ſeruant, whom for hys offences, the King in hys diſpleaſure, were ready to caſt, not onely out of hys ſeruice, but alſo into perpetuall priſon: euen ſo Chriſt our onely Sauiour, and Gods only ſonne, did offer vp himſelfe, as a raunſome vnto his Father for vs, whereby he pacified the wrath of hys Father, and adioyned vs with himſelfe, to be ſonne and heyres of hys Fathers glorie. And this hath Chriſt done, not only now in tyme, but alſo euerlaſtingly in the moſt hygh and eternall purpoſe of God, before the foundation of the world was layde.
               Thus I end, thinking it ſufficient for this preſēt, that I haue in theſe few wordes pourged my ſelfe of thoſe thīgs which you lay to my charge, & ſet forth vnto your iudgement, the errors of Pelagius, that you may the better diſeerne, who they are, whych are worthie to be called after that ſect: and alſo plainly declared, in what pointes my conſcience differeth, from certayne teachers of our time: and vpon what groūd, I am moued ſo to miſſlike ſome part of their doctrine, whych thyngs if you diligently weye and conſider, readyng the ſame wythout partiallitie: then haue I my deſire.

               I am glad, that Cerberus is nowe come to an ende. Much adoe he had to let ſlip ſo manie things as offered themſelues to be ſpoken off. But now he hath cōcluded, concenting him ſelfe wyth fewe wordes, in purging him ſelfe of thoſe things that his friende charged him with, and ſetting forth the Pelagians errours. &c.
               Yet, euen in the winding vp of ye matter, he hath found one part of doctrine, hanging vpon the Article of Gods eternal predeſtinatiō, which is to be miſliked of al mē (if Cerberus be not deceyued) and that is: That as the only will & purpoſe of God is the chiefe cauſe of Election and Reprobation: ſo his free mercie in Chriſt is an inferiour cauſe of ſaluatiō. &c. Here Cerberus doth of purpoſe leaue out the ende of that gloſe, ſhutting vp the matter wyth his. &c. I will therefore ſet downe the words that follow, which are theſe: and the hardening of the heart an inferiour cauſe of damnation. Now this gloſe is ſome thing more plaine than it was before, as Cerberus hath cited it with his. &c. He thought belike, that the Bible wherin he findeth this gloſe, is not in euerie mans hande, and therefore his. &c. ſhould cauſe men to thinke that the reſt of the gloſe muſt be as good ſtuffe as he thinketh the firſt part to be. That is worthy to be miſliked of all men, importing a ſophiſticall ſearch of bottomleſſe ſecretes, and drawing from Chriſt. Such ſhifts doth Cerberus vſe, to make mē miſlike with that which he himſelfe liketh not.
               But to proue this part of doctrine to be ſuch as Cerberus aſſirmeth it to be: he vſeth two reaſons. One is, that the eternall purpoſe of God, ſpringeth out of hys frée mercie in Chriſt: wherefore that frée mercie cannot be inferiour to Gods eternall purpoſe, more than the fountaine, from which ſtreames of water do ſlowe, can

be inferiour to the ſtreames that flow from it. The other is of the mediation of Chriſt. For if God did in his eternall will and purpoſe, elect vs before Chriſt had appeaſed his wrath, by his mediation: then was it but a vaine thing for Chriſt to be a Mediatour, neyther had we any neede of his mediation.
               Although I would gladly content my ſelf, to haue defended mine own writings, and other mens wherewith Cerberus findeth fault, euen with as fewe wordes as he vſeth in purging himſelfe and other, of that which his friend layeth to his charge: yet may I not ſo ſhortly ſlip ouer this matter wherewith Cerberus hath ſhut vp his aunſwere.
               For if Cerberus would haue ſought how to haue ſet forth to be ſéene, his owne wilfull ignorance, and errour in the chiefe pointes of our Religion: he could not haue found a better meane, thā he hath vſed in theſe two reaſons that he maketh againſt the doctrine conteyned in the gloſe wherewith he miſliketh.
               For what greater errour can there be, than to holde that with God there is time paſt, and time to come: and that any of the eſſentiall properties of God do ſpring out of other in time, as though there had bene or could haue bene a time, wherein God lacked thoſe properties? Or that the ſonne of God, the ſeconde perſon in Trinitie, ſhould in his diuine nature in time, make mediation to God the Father, that thereby he might purpoſe to ſaue man, whom he was before purpoſed to deſtroy. For ſtriuing againſt him that hath ſayde, that the only will and purpoſe of God, is the chiefe cauſe of Election and Reprobation: and that his frée mercie in Chriſt is an inferiour cauſe of ſaluation. &c. He ſayth that the purpoſe or will of God to ſaue vs, muſt néedes ſpring out of the frée mercie of God, and that therefore the will or purpoſe of

God in ſauing, muſt of force be inferiour to his mercie, euen as ſtreames that iſſue from fountaines, are inferiour to the fountaines that they come from.
               And to proue this, he citeth the words of Eccleſiaſticus the. 2. Chapter. Secundum enim magnitudinem ipſius: ſic & miſericordia illius cum ipſo est. That is: Euen according to his owne greatneſſe, ſo is his mercie with hym. He citeth alſo the ſaying of S. Iames. Cap. 2. of his Epiſtle, where he ſayth. Iudicium enim ſine miſcricordia: illi qui nòn ſacit miſcricordiam. Gloriatur autem miſcricordia aduerſus iudicium. That is: He that ſheweth no mercie, ſhall haue iudgemēt without mercie. But mercie reioyſeth againſt iudgement. And againe, he citeth the words of Dauid in the Pſalm. 145. Miſcricordia eius ſuper omnia opera eius. That is: His mercie is vpon all his workes.
               All this ado he maketh, to proue that Gods will and purpoſe are inferiours to his mercie. But how well that is by theſe Scriptures proued, I referre to the iudgement of the indifferent Reader. Sirach ſayth, that thoſe which feare the Lorde will prepare their heartes, and humble their ſoules before the Lord. Let vs fall into the handes of God, and not into the hands of men: For euen as his greatneſſe is, ſo is his mercy. Sirach his purpoſe is to ſet forth the effect of ye feare of God, which worketh in ye hartes of mē, a true turning to God, with an aſſured hope of forgiueneſſe at his hande, bicauſe they be perſuaded, that he is no leſſe readie to forgiue penitent ſinners, than he is able to puniſh the impenitent.
               S. Iames ſayth, that the merciful ſhall finde mercie, minding to perſuade all men to ſhew mercie one to another. Aſſuring themſelues, that vnleſſe they do ſo, they can finde no mercie with God, and on the contrarie, if they do ſhew mercie, they ſhall not néede to feare iud
                     •
                  ement, for mercie ſhall preuaile againſt iudgement.
               
                  
And Dauid the Prophet hath ſaid, that Gods mercie is vpon all his workes, although it pleaſe Cerberus to cite his wordes otherwiſe, for his purpoſe. For he ſayth, that Dauid hath ſaid, that the Lordes mercie is aboue all his workes. Which words though they be true, yet hath not Dauid ſo ſayd, neyther maye I ſuffer Cerberus, to cauſe the Prophet Dauid to ſpeake as he woulde haue him, that his fantaſie might be maintained by the Prophetes words. Dauids meaning is to teach that the Lord God ſheweth mercie vpon all his works, ſo that there is not one of the works of God, that hath not cauſe to praiſe him for his louing kindneſſe and mercie. Both ye Hebrue and Gréeke Text, and al the tranſlations in Latine, and Engliſh too (ſo many as I haue ſeene) do giue thys ſenſe of the Prophetes wordes.
               How can Cerberus proue then, by theſe Scriptures, that the mercie of God is the fountaine of his wil & purpoſe? All that he doeth therefore is nothing elſe but a ſetting forth of his owne wilfull ignoraunce, whereby he is fallen into the filthy errour of them that imagine of God, as of a man, and that he is moued with affectiōs as men be. Whereas, in God: His vnderſtanding, his vnmeaſurable power, his vnſearcheable wiſedome, his mercifull goodneſſe, his truth and iuſtice, his chaſteneſſe and fréedome in all poyntes, to wyll what he luſteth, to do what it pleaſeth him, and to purpoſe & appoynt what liketh him: are eſſentiall properties, without which he neyther is, nor can be God. To imagine therefore, that there was a time wherein God was purpoſed to deſtroy man, and that his mercie in Chriſt hath chaunged that purpoſe, and cauſed him now to purpoſe and will to ſaue man: is to imagine yt there was a time wherin God was not ſo mercifull as he is now, & ſo, not ſo perfectly God as he is now. And that by experiēce he hath learned ſome

what more wiſedome than he had at the firſt, and therefore, may be wiſer hereafter than he is now. How great abſurdities theſe are, I leaue to the iudgement of the indifferent Readers.
               But Cerberus will ſaye, that though I haue ſayde ſome thing againſt him, yet I haue ſayd nothing for him whoſe wordes I haue taken in hande to defende: but in my wordes I ſéeme to fight againſt them both. I aunſwere: I haue not taken vpon me to defend, eyther mine owne or other mens wordes, ſucder than in conſcience I thinke them to be true. And if I did thinke that the wryter of that gloſe did meane as groſſely, as I perceyue by his open wordes that Cerberus doth: I would not ſpare him more than I haue ſpared Cerberus: but for as much as his wordes ſéeme not to me, to haue any ſuch meaning as to teach that there was a time, wherein God was mercileſſe towards mā, & that his mercy firſt ſprang out of his will and purpoſe (as Cerberus doth plainely teach, that his wil and purpoſe ſprang out of his mercie) I muſt not refuſe to take that good meaning of his wordes, which may ſéeme to me to be according to the truth of Chriſtian religion.
               The wordes of Paule, whervpon this note is made, are theſe. I will haue mercie on him, to whō I wil ſhew mercie. Upon this it is noted in the margine, that as the onlie will and purpoſe of God is the chiefe cauſe of Election and Reprobation: ſo his frée mercie in Chriſt is an inferiour cauſe of ſaluation: and the hardening of the heart an inferiour cauſe of damnation. I vnderſtand the meaning of theſe words to be, that as the only wil & purpoſe of God is the chiefe cauſe, that there was an Election and choiſe of ſome, and a refuſall of other ſome: ſo the ſhewing forth of his mercie in Chriſt, is an inferiour cauſe, that is, an inſtrumentall cauſe whereby ſaluation

is wrought in the elected, according to Gods will and purpoſe, and the hardening of the hearts of the reprobates, an inſtrumentall cauſe of damnation, in the reprobates, according to the ſame eternal wil and purpoſe.
               He therefore that ſayth we muſt aſcende to an higher cauſe of Election, than that which appeareth in the execution of Gods mercie in Chriſt, doth not teach to ſet vp the eſſentiall properties one aboue another, as thoughe one were fountaine of another, and that God lacked the one till it ſprang out of the other: but he teacheth that the ſame mercie that we ſée executed in Chriſt in time, was decreed in the eternall will and purpoſe of God before all time, and ſo was the refuſall of thē whoſe heartes we ſee hardened in time. If any man do ſée cauſe to iudge otherwiſe of this gloſe: I am well pleaſed that the ſame vſe his owne iudgement in enterpreting the meaning therof. And if I may perceyue any mans iudgement herein to be ſounder than mine, I truſt I ſhalbe ready to condeſcend to that.
               And leaſt any man ſhould thinke, that herein I doe followe mine owne fantacie, without example of any thing that I ſée in the auncient Fathers: I will ſette downe the wordes of S. Auſten, that haue bene a meane to confirme me herein.

That is to ſaye: But bycauſe God did know all things before hand, and therfore could not be ignorant that man ſhould ſinne: we muſt teach that the holie Citie is ſuch a thing as he did foreſée and appoint that it ſhould be, not ſuch as we could not come to the knowledge of, bicauſe it was not in that diſpoſition or order that God made. Neyther was man, by his ſinne able to diſorder the purpoſe of God, as though he ſhoulde haue conſtreyned God to chaunge the thyng that he had once decréed: ſéeing that God by his foreſight did preuent both, that is to ſay, both how the euill man ſhould become (whom he had created good) and alſo what thing he woulde make of him, euen when he ſhoulde in ſuch wiſe become euill. For although it be ſayd that God doth chaunge his purpoſes (whereof it commeth that by a figuratiue ſpeach, it is reade in the holie Scriptures, that God did repent) the ſame is ſpoken according to that which man hoped for, or that which the order of naturall cauſes did import: not according to that, which the almightie did know before hand that he himſelf would do.
               Againe, the ſame Auſten in his booke De diuerſis questionibus. 83. and the. 15. 16. 17. queſtions ſayth thus. Deus omnium quae ſunt cauſa est. Quod autem omnium rerum cauſa est: etiam ſapientiae ſuae cauſa est. Nec vnquàm Deus ſine ſapientia ſua: Igitur ſempiternae ſapientiae ſuae, cauſa est ſempiterna, nec tempore prior est quam ſua ſapientia. Deinde, ſi patrem ſempiternum eſse inest deo, nec ſuit aliquandò non pater: nunquam ſine filio fuit. Omne praeteritum iam nòn est. Omne futurum nòn dùm est. Omne igitur & praeteritum & futur
                        〈…〉
                      non deest. Apud d
                        〈…〉
                     m autem nihil deest: Nec praeteritum igitur, nec futurum, ſed omne praeſens est apud deum.
               
               
                  
That is to ſaye: God is the cauſe of all thoſe things that be. And in aſmuch as he is the cauſe of all things: he is the cauſe of his owne wiſedome. Neyther was God at any time without his owne wiſedome: therefore he is the euerlaſting cauſe of his owne euerlaſting wiſedome, neyther is he in time more auncient than his owne wiſdome. Furthermore, if to be an euerlaſting Father, be a thing that is in God, and that he hath not at any time not bene a Father: then hath he neuer bene without a ſonne. Whatſoeuer is paſt, is not now. Whatſoeuer is to come, is not yet. Therefore, whatſoeuer is paſt or to come, is wanting, but with God there is nothing wanting. There is with God therefore nothing paſt or to come, but all preſent.
               Theſe ſayings of Auſten do ſéeme to me ſufficient to ſtaie a man in that minde that I am of, concerning the cauſe of Gods Election and Reprobation. His will and purpoſe which could neuer be wanting in him, neyther can by any meanes be altered, chaunged or letted, maye well be called the cauſe why he hath choſen ſome, and reiected ſome other ſome. And this Election is in him euerlaſting as he himſelfe is: neither may it be thought that there was euer any time wherein he had not elected thoſe that be elected, and refuſed thoſe that be refuſed. But we holde not that this is done without Chriſt, and therefore Cerberus laboureth more than néedeth to proue by Scriptures that our Election is in Chriſt. For we accompt Chriſt to be eternall as his Father is, and his incarnation to be alwayes preſent with God. And therefore, that the Election that is in Gods purpoſe and wil, is not without Chriſt the mercyſeate and mediatour betwixt God and man. Thus much for the firſt of Cerberus his two reaſons.
               Now a fewe wordes to his ſecond reaſon, and ſo an

end. Firſt, Cerberus doeth in this reaſon flatly affirme, that God did not loue the worlde, nor giue his ſonne for the worlde, before his wrath was appeaſed by the mediation of his ſonne. Wherevpon it followeth, that there was a time, wherein God was wroth with the worlde, and not pacified by his Sonne. Which doctrine is as muche as to denie Chriſt to be a mediatour. But in the cloſing vp of the matter, he ouerthroweth that againe, affirming that Chriſt hath pacified the wrath of his father, not onely nowe in tyme, but alſo euerlaſtingly in the moſt highe and eternall purpoſe of God before the foundation of the worlde was layed.
               Hitherto he hath fought againſt vs: but nowe in the concluſiō he ioyneth with vs, calling the purpoſe of God eternall and moſt high. And what is that but to affirme all that we teache concerning the cauſe of Election and Reprobation.
               As touching the mediation of Chriſt: we holde that which S. Auſten wryteth in his Homelie, De ouibus. Non mediator homo praeter Deitatem, Non mediator Deus praeter humanitatem. Ecce mediator. Diuinitas ſine humanitate non eſt mediatrix. Humanitas ſine diuinitate, non eſt mediatrix. Sed inter diuinitatem ſolam, & humanitatem ſolam, mediatrix eſt, humana diuinitas, & diuina humanitas Christi.
               
               Man without the Godhead, is not mediatour. God without the manhode is not mediatour: Loe here is the mediatour. The diuinitie without the humanitie is not mediatrix. The humanitie without the diuinitie is not mediatrix: but the humane diuinitie and the diuine humanitie of Chriſt, is the mediatrix betwéene the diuinitie alone and the humanitie alone. And this mediation doe we holde (as in his concluſion, at vnwares I think, Cerberus hath confeſſed) to be euerlaſting in the eternall and moſt highe purpoſe of God: according to the

ſaying of Saint Iohn in the ſeconde of his firſt Epiſtle. We haue an Aduocate with God the Father, which is Ieſus Chriſt the righteous. To whome with his Father and the holy Ghoſt be all honour and glorie. Amen.
               Thus in as fewe wordes as I could: I haue defended that doctrine of Gods Prouidence & Predeſtination, which I and others, haue taught, and as occaſion ſerueth, doe teach, both in preaching and wryting. Beſéeching the Chriſtian Reader to call vpon God, for the ayde of his holy ſpirite to aſſiſt vs, and to make vs able to continue in the teaching of true doctrine, in this and all other Articles that concerne Chriſtian religion, that by vs, as the miniſters of God, the congregation of Ieſus Chriſt maye be edified.
               And if the Authour of the anſwere, doe finde himſelfe grieued for that I haue talked of him vnder the name of Cerberus: my deſire is, that he woulde make his right name knowne to me eyther by worde or wryting, and if he thinke himſelfe able to diſproue ought that I haue written in this defence, he ſhall eyther finde me able to mayntayne my wryting by good authoritie, or elſe readie to yelde to better. But if he will lurcke ſtill in ſecret, and caſt abroade ſuche libelles as is this anſwere to his friends letter: I wil not trouble my ſelfe any more in defending my ſelfe & others againſt him that dare not ſhew his face. Farewell. If thou profite in reading, I haue the gayne that I ſought in writing.
