               A shorte Introduction into the Science of Musicke, made for such as are desirous to haue the knowledge therof, for the singing of these Psalmes.
            
               FOr that the rude & ignorant in Song, may with more delight desire, and good wyl: be moued and drawen to the godly exercise of singing of Psalmes, aswell in common place of prayer, where altogether with one voyce render thankes & prayses to God, as priuatly by themselues, or at home in their houses: I haue set here in the beginning of this boke of psalmes, an easie and moste playne way and rule, of the order of the Notes and Kayes of singing, whiche commonly is called the scale of Musicke, or the Gamma vt. Wherby (any diligeÃÑce geuen therunto) euerye man may in a fewe dayes: yea, in a few houres, easely without all payne, & that also without ayde or helpe of any other teacher, attayne to a sufficient, knowledg, to singe any Psalme contayned in thys Booke, or any suche other playne and easy Songes as these are.
            
               
               
                  ‚òû Beholde this table
                  gamut
               
            
            In this table, or gaÃÑma vt, is coÃÑteyned all, what is necessari to the knoweledge of singing Wherefore it must be diligent lie waid & muste also bee perfectly coÃÑmitted to memory, so that ye can redely and distinctly say it without boke, both forwarde and backward: that is, vpward and downward And this is the greatest pain that ye nede to take in this trauayle.
            
               
Ye must also note that the letters ascending on the left hande of the Table, are called Kaies, or Cleuis: of whiche the first is a Greke letter, signifying g, & is called gamma, (of whom the whole table or scale is called, the Gamma vt.) All the other ar lattin letters vii. in number. a, b, c, d, e, f, g, then repeting the same again, beginning at a, & the third time repeting the same, till ye com to ee, la. which is the last, but all these Kayes ar not signed or set in these Psalmes: but onely ii. or three most commonly c, or e, or b. C, hath this form or signe, ùÑ° E, is signed after this maner ùÑ¢ B, hath thus, ‚ñ™ or thus sharpe. ‚ôØ
            
            The kayes of this Scale or Table, are deuided and set forth by thre diuers orders of letters. From gamma vt, to G, sol, re, vt,, ar signed with capitall letters, & are called graue base, or capitall kayes: From G, sol, re, vt: to G, sol, re, vt, they are wrytten with small letters: and are called meane or small kayes: And from g, sol, re, vt, to ee, la, they are written with double letters, and are called double kaies, and treble kaies.
            When it chaunceth ii. kaies to be of one letter, as G sol, re, vt: and g, sol, re, vt, A, la, mi, re


               
and, a, la, mi, re, E, fa, vt: and f, fa, vt: E, la, mi, & e, la, mi, ye may (to put difference and distinctioÃÑ betwene them) call the one, capitall G, or G, sol, re, vt, the lower: and tother small g, or g, sol, re, vt: the higher, and so of others.
            They are called kayes, because they opeÃÑ, as it were the doore, and make awaye into song: for by the sight and place of the kaye, ye shall know easelye the whole songe, the nature of euery Note, in what kaie or place it standeth, and how ye shall name it. ye see also in the table, that some of the kayes be set in lines or rules, and other are set in spaces betwene the lines: as gamma, vt, is set in rule: a, re, in space:: b, mi, in rule. c, fa vt: in space d, sol, re, in rule, and so ascending to the ende: so also in the songs of your Boke, ye se rules and spaces: so that euery rule & space in your boke, answereth to some one rule or space of your table or scale: and taketh the name of the same, whiche ye may easely fynde oute, eyther by ascending or descending from the kaye set and marked in your song.
            Moreouer it is to be noted, that there are vi. voyces, or Notes, signified and expressed by these vi. sillables: vt: re mi, fa, sol, la, by whiche through repetition of them, may be soÃÑg



al songes of what compasse so euer they be, which vi. notes, ye must learn to tune aptely of some one that can already sing, or by som Instrument of musike, as the Uirginals, or some other suche like, Which thing wel learned, ye shal nede none other teaching of any
            And for a plainer learning therof, I haue set before your eyes, those vi. notes asceÃÑding and descending: and again with a litle varietie from theyr naturall order, to the end ye may attayne to the iust tunes of them, how so euer they be placed. For these two examples well had, and tuned a righte, all other songes and Psalmes, with little vse and a small labour will sone be attayned vnto 
                  „Äà‚ô´„Äâ
               
            
            Firste ye muste diligently searche out, in what kaie euery note of your song stoÃÑdeth: Which ye may easely do, in beholding your signed kaie (coÃÑmoÃÑly called the cleaue) which is set in the beginning of euery song: & that lyne or, space wherin the signed kaie is set, beareth the name of the same kaie: and all Notes standinge in ye line or space, are saide



to stand in that kaie: and so ascending or desceÃÑding from that kaie, ye shall straight way see wherin, or in what kaie euery Note of your song standeth. As in this present example. if ye will know wherin your first Note standeth, consider youre kaie, signed & marked with this letter C. in the second rule (and because it standeth in rule, ye finde, by youre Table that it is C, sol, fa, vt: For thother two c, c, whiche are, c, fa, vt: and, cc, sol fa: stande in space) wherfore that seconde lyne throughout, is called, c, sol, fa, vt, and all the notes placed in that line, are counted to stand in c, sol, fa, vt: Then discend froÃÑ that kaie to the next space, which (as your table telleth you) is b, fa, ‚ôØ, mi. from thence to the next rule, whiche is a, la, mi, re, & from thence to the nexte space wherin your first Note standeth, which is G, sol, re vt: so finde ye by descending in order beginning at youre signed kaye, after thys sorte: c, sol, fa, vt,: b, fa, ‚ôØ, mi: a, la, mi, re: G, sol, re, vt: ye find that your first note standeth in G, sol, re, vt: wherfore ye may sing it by anye of these iii. Notes sol, re, or vt: But because this note vt, in this place is most aptest to ascend withall: ye shall call it vt: by the same triall ye shal find that your second Note standeth



in a, la, mi, re, ye shall expresse in singing by this voice re, rather then by la, or mi, because re, is in order next aboue vt, so shall ye finde the thirde Note to stand in b, fa, ‚ôØ, mi, which ye shall expresse by mi, The fourth standeth in the signed kaie or cleaue, wherfore it standeth in c, sol, fa, vt, whiche ye must expresse by fa. The fift in d, la, sol, re: and is to be expressed by sol. The sixt and highest Note, ye shall by ascending from your keie, finde to stande in e, la, mi: and is to be expressed in voice by la, so haue youthe whole compasse of your soÃÑg‚ñ™ and as in order of notes, and sound of voice, ye ascendid, so contrarie wise; ye must defceÃÑd till ye come to the last Note of your song.
            Here note that when b, fa, ‚ôØ, mi, is formed and sighed in this maner, with this letter b, whiche is called b, flat, it must be expressed with this voice or note, fa, but if it be formed and signed with this forme ‚ôØ, whiche is called b, sharpe: or if it haue no signe at all, then must ye expres it in singing with thys voyce or Note. mi.
            
            Like wise may ye practise; placing youre first Note vt, in anye other kaye, wherin ye finde vt, whiche are. vii. GaÃÑma, vt, C, fa, vt: E; fa vt, graue: G, sol, re, vt, graue: c, sol, fa, vt: E, fa, vt,


               
sharpe: g, sol, re, vt, sharpe, ascending vp to la, and descending as in your former example. These vii. seuerall ascensions and descensyons vpon diuers groundes or cleues, are coÃÑ
               monlye called of writers vii. deductions, whiche ye may playnlye and distinctlye beholde in your table, or Scale.
            One example more haue I set, wherin ye sing fa, in b, fa, ‚ôØ, mi. Whose deductions beginneth in vt: placed in, E, fa, vt, graue or capital as ye see. 
                  „Äà‚ô´„Äâ
               
            
            Ye haue also in youre songes diuers fourmes and figures of Notes. Of which all, it behoueth you to knowe bothe the names and value.
            Diuers forms of Notes. 
                  „Äà‚ô´„Äâ
               
            
            The firste of these is cassed a Large: the secoÃÑd a Long. The third a Brief the fourth a Semibrief: the fift a Minime: the sixt a Crochet: The seuenth and laste a Quauer. The first is worth in value two of the seconde, that is, two Longes: and one



Longe is worth ii. Breues: and one Breue, is two Semibrefes. & one Semibrefe: two Minimest and hathet wise the time in pronouncing in singing that the Minime hath One Minime is worthe two crochets: and one Crochet, is two quauers, as appereth in this Table folowing.
            
            If there chaunce any pricke to be set by anye of these Notes, the pricke is worthe in value the Note nexte folowing it. As apricke set by a Semibriefe, as thus, ùÜπ¬∑ is worthe this none, ÌÜπÌÖ• whiche is a Minime: and a pricke by a Minime, as here, ÌÜπÌÖ•¬∑ is worth a ÌÜ∫ÌÖ•. There are also oftentimes ‚ñ™ in singing, ‚ñ™ Pauses or Restes, setin songes,



some time for ease of the singer, and comely staye of the songes: sometime where diuers parts are, for swetnes of the armonye, and apte repetityons & reportes: Which are signifyed by lifte strikes or lines, or halfe lines betwene the rules: as thus. 
                  „Äà‚ô´„Äâ
               
            
            The first which is drawen from the firste line to the iii. is called a longe Rest: & signifyeth that ye must pause while that a longe is song, whiche is worthe iiii. plaine song Notes, or foure Semibreues. The second which is from one lyne to a nother, is called a Breue rest, & requireth the pauling of a breue or of ii. semibreues. The iii. whiche is from a lyne to the halfe space vnderneth: is called a semibreue rest, and requireth the pause or space while a semibreue is in singing. The fourthe whiche is ascending from the line, to the halfe space aboue, is called a Minime rest, & is but the drawing of a breth, while a minime may be song The fifte and laste, whiche is like vnto the Minime reste, but croked at the top, requireth the pause of a crochet.
            To set out a full and absolute knowledg of the nature of the scale, the differences betwene notes and halfe notes, & halfe notes



betwene themselues, of interualles, proportions: and which notes concorde and agree together, and which disagree. What modes there are: and how many. What is perfection, what imperfection: How notes oughte to be bounde together, and what theyr value is so bounde, tayled vpwarde or downewarde? perteineth to a iust Introduction to the arte of Musike. These thinges before taught, seme at this time, for the poore vnlearned and rude, sufficiente and inoughe to the atteyning of such knowledg in singing as shall be requisite to the singing of Psalmes conteined in this boke, for which cause only they are set out.
         
         
            
            
               A Treatise made by Athanasius the great, wherin is setforth, how, and in what manner ye may vse the Psalmes, according to theffect of the minde: of gladnes or sorow: accordingly. which Psalmes ye shall vse for prayer, which for thankesgeuing, which for rehersal of Gods wonderful actes, to the praise of his name. Also ye may se in them how God hath holpen his chosen people from time, to tyme, and neuer forsoke them.
            
               THe whole scripture vniuersally is as it were a diuine Maystres. teaching both vertue and true faythe: but the booke of the Psalmes hathe ouer and besydes that, in a maner an expres ymage of the state & condicion of soules: For as he whiche goeth to a kyng, composeth fyrst his behauiour, and setteth in order his wordes, least he shoulde be counted rusticall and rude: so this deuine booke, fyrst by choise of all motions, wherwith the soule is affected, warneth, then frameth and instructeth by diuers formes of speaking all suche as couet vertue, and defyre to knowe the lyfe of the Sauiour. It is easy therefore for euery man to finde out in the Psalmes, the motion and state of his owne soule, and by that meanes, his own figure and proper erudition. Moreouer with what words he may please God, & with what wordes he may correcte himselfe, and geue God thankes, Lest if he speake that thing whiche is not leefull, he fall into impietie. For not alone of dedes but also of euerye worde muste we geue accounte before the iudge. wherfore if thou wilt pronounce any man happy and blessed: thou hast how and wherefore, and whom thou maist cal happy, in the Psalmes, as you may se in the first psalm. 32. psalme. 41. psa. 112. psalme. 119. psalme, and the, 128. psalme.

In Trinitie and Trinitie in vnitie alone.
                  So as we neyther doo confound, the persons of the three,
                  Nor yet the substance whole of one In sunder parted be.
               
               
                  One person of the father is, an other of the Sonne,
                  An other person propre of the holy Ghost alone.
                  Of Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost but one the Godhed is,
                  Like glory, coeternall eke the maiestie likewise.
               
               
                  Suche as the father is, such is the Sonne in eche degree,
                  And suche also we do beleue the holy Ghost to be.
                  Nncreat is the Father, and vncreat is the Sonne,
                  The holy Ghost, vncreate: so vncreat is eche one.
               
               
                  In comprehensible Father is, Incomprehensible Sonne,
                  And comprehensible also is The holy Ghost of none.
                  The Father is eternall, and the Sonne eternall so,

                  And yet though we beleue that eche of these eternall be:
                  Yet there but one eternall is, and not eternals three.
                  As ne incomprensible we, ne yet vncreat three,
                  But one incomprensible, one vncreat holde to be.
               
               
                  Almightie so the father is, the sonne almightye so,
                  And in like sort almightye is the holy Ghost also,
                  And albeit that euery one of these almightie be:
                  Yet there but one almightie is, and not almighties three.
               
               
                  The Father God is, God the Sonne, God holy Ghost also:

                  So likewise Lorde the Father is, and Lorde also the Sonne,
                  And Lord the holy Ghost: yet are there not three Lordes, but one.
               
               
                  For as we are compeld to graunt by Christian veritie,
                  Eche of the persons by himselfe both God and Lord to be.

That eyther Gods be three, or that there Lordes be three to say.
               
               
                  Of none the father is, ne made ne creat, nor begot:
                  The Sonne is of the Father, not creat ne made but got.
                  The holy Ghost is of them both, the father and the Sonne,
                  Ne made, ne creat, nor begot, but doth procede alone.
               
               
                  So we one Father hold, not three: one Sonne also not three:
                  One holy Ghost alone, and not three holy Ghostes to be.
                  None in this Trinitie before, nor after other is:
                  Ne greater any then the rest, ne lesser be likewise.
               
               
                  But euery one amonge them selues, of all the persons three:
                  Together coeternall all, and all coequall be.
                  So vnitie in Trinitie, as said it is before:
                  And Trinitie in vnitie in all things we adore.
               
               
                  Therfore what man so euer that saluation will attayne:
                  This faith touching the Trinitie: of force he must reteyne.
                  
                     
And nedefull to eternall life it is that euery wight
                  Of the incarnating of Christ our Lord beleue a right.
               
               
                  For this the right faith is, that we beleue and eke beknow,

                  Who though he be both very God and very man also:
                  yet is he but one Christ alone and is not persons two.
                  One not by turning of Godhed into the flesh of man:

But onely by the vnitie that is of one persone.
                  For as the reasonable soule and flesh but one man is:

Sa. xxi whome in this title he calleth Abimelech (whiche was a general name to al the kings of the Philistenes) he prayseth God for his deliueraunce prouoking all others, by his example to trust in God, to feare and serue him, who defendeth the godly with his angels, and vtterly destroieth the wicked in theyr sinnes.

                     „Äà‚ô´„Äâ
                   I must confes, how yt continually thy lawes I 
                     „Äà‚ô´„Äâ
                   doo transgres. Thy lawes I do transgresse.
               
                  But if it be thy will,
                  With sinners to contend:
                  Then all thy flock shall spill,
                  And be lost without end.
                  For who liueth here so right,
                  That rightly he can say:
                  He sinneth not in thy sight,
                  Full oft and euery day.
               
               
                  Thy scripture plaine telth me,
                  The righteous man offendeth:
                  Seuen times a day to thee,
                  Wheron thy wrath dependth,
                  So that the rightwise man,
                  Doth walke in no such path:
                  but he falth now or than,
                  In daunger of thy wrath,
               
               
                  Then since the case so standes,
                  That euen the man rightwise:
                  Falth oft in sinfull bandes,
                  Wherby thy wrath may ryse.
                  Lorde I that am vniust,
                  And rightwisenes none haue:
                  
                     
Wherto then shall I trust.
                  My synfull soule to saue.
               
               
                  But truly to that post,
                  Wherto I cleaue and shall:
                  Whiche is thy mercy most,
                  Lorde let thy mercy fall.
                  And mitigate thy mode,
                  Or els we perish all:
                  The pryce of this thy bloud,
                  Wherin mercy I call.
               
               
                  Thy scripture doth declare,
                  No drop of bloud in thee:
                  But that thou didst not spare,
                  To shed eche drop for me.
                  Now let those drops most swet,
                  So moyst my hart so dry:
                  That I with sinne replete,
                  May liue and sinne may die.
               
               
                  That being mortifyed,
                  Thys synne of myne in me:
                  I may be sanctifyed,
                  By grace of thine in thee.
                  So that I neuer fall,
                  Into suche mortall sinne:
                  That my foes infernall,
                  Reioyse my death therin.
               
               
                  But vouchesafe me to keep,
                  From those infernall foes:
                  And from that lake so depe,
                  Wheras no mercy growes,
                  
                     
And I shall sing the songes
                  Confirmed with the iust:
                  That vnto thee belonges,
                  Whiche art mine only trust.

                   how I doo still lament: my sinnes wherin I do

                  No no, not so thy will is bent, To deale with sinners in thine ire.
                  But when in hart they shall repent, Thou grauntst with sped their iust desire
                  To thee therfore still shall I cry, to wash away my sinfull cryme:
                  Thy bloud (O Lorde) is not yet drye, but that it may help me in time.
               
               
                  Hast thee O Lorde, hast thee I say, To power on me the giftes of grace:
                  That when this life must flit away, In heauen with thee I may haue place,
                  Where thou dost reigne eternally, with God which once did downe the seÃÑd
                  Where angels sing continually, To thee be prayse world without end.

                  THe Lorde be thanked for his gyftes,
                  And mercy euermore:
                  That he doth shew vnto his saynctes Sing this as the. xxx vii. Psa
                  
                  To him be laud therfore.
                  Our tonges cannot so prayse the Lorde,
                  As he doth right deserue:
                  Our harts can not of hym so thynke,
                  As he doth vs preserue.
               
               
                  
                  His benefites they be so great,
                  To vs that be but sinne:
                  That at our handes for recompence,
                  There is no hope to winne.
                  O sinfull flesh, that thou shouldest haue,
                  Suche mercyes of the Lorde:
                  Thou doest deserue, more worthely,
                  Of him to be abhord.
               
               
                  Nought els but sinne‚ñ™ and wretchednes,
                  Doth rest within our heartes:
                  And stubburnely against the Lorde,
                  We dayly play oure partes.
                  The sunne aboue in firmament,
                  That is to vs a lyght:
                  Doth shew it selfe more cleane and pure,
                  Then we be in his sight.
               
               
                  The heauens aboue and all therin,
                  More holy are then we:
                  They serue the Lorde in theyr estate,
                  Eche one in his degree.
                  They do not stryue for mastership,
                  Nor slake theyr office set:
                  But feare the Lorde and do his will,
                  Hate is to them no let.
               
               
                  Also the earth and all therin,
                  Of God it is in awe:
                  It doth obserue the formers wyll,
                  By skilfull natures law.
                  The sea and all that therin is,
                  Doth bend, when God doth beck:
                  
                     
The spirtes beneathe doo tremble all,
                  And feare his wrathfull check.
               
               
                  But we alas, for whom all these
                  Were made them for to rule,
                  Do not so know or loue the Lorde,
                  As doth the Oxe or mule,
                  A law he gaue for vs to know,
                  What was his holy wyll:
                  He would vs good, but we will not
                  Auoyd the thing is ill.
               
               
                  Not one of vs that seketh out
                  The Lorde of lyfe to please:
                  Nor to the thyng that might vs ioyne
                  Our Christ and quiet ease,
                  Thus we are all his enemyes,
                  We can it not deny:
                  And he agayne, of his good wyll,
                  Would not that we should dye.
               
               
                  Therfore when remedy was none,
                  To bring vs vnto lyfe:
                  The sonne of God, our flesh he toke,
                  To mend our mortall stryfe:
                  And all the law of God our Lorde,
                  He did it full obey:
                  And for our sinnes vpon the crosse,
                  Hys bloud our dettes did pay.
               
               
                  And that we should not yet forget,
                  What good be to vs wrought:
                  A signe he left our eyes to tell,
                  That he our bodyes bought.
                  
                     
In breade and wine here visible,
                  Unto thyne eyes and tast,
                  His mercyes great thou maist record,
                  If that his spryte thou hast.
               
               
                  As once the corne did liue and grow,
                  And was cut downe with sith,
                  And threshed out with many stripes,
                  Out from his huske to dryue,
                  And as the mill with violence
                  Did teare it out so small,
                  And made it lyke to earthly dust,
                  Not sparing it at all.
               
               
                  And as the ouen with fyre hot,
                  Did close it vp in heat:
                  And all this done that I haue sayd,
                  That it should be our meat:
                  So was the Lorde in his ripe age
                  Cut downe by cruell death:
                  His soule he gaue in torments great,
                  And yelded vp his breath.
               
               
                  Because that he to vs might be,
                  An euerlasting bread,
                  with muche reproche and trouble great,
                  On earth his lyfe he led.
                  And as the grapes in pleasant tyme
                  Are pressed very sore,
                  And plucked downe when they be rype,
                  Nor let to grow no more,
               
               
                  Because the ioyse that in them is,
                  As comfortable drynke,
                  
                     
We myght receyue and ioyfull be,
                  when sorowes make vs shrinke.
                  So Christes bloud out pressed was,
                  With nailes and eke with speare:
                  The ioyse wherof doth saue all those,
                  That rightly do him feare.
               
               
                  And as the cornes by vnitie,
                  Into one lofe is knit:
                  So is the Lorde and his whole churche,
                  Though he in heauen sit.
                  As many grapes make but one wyne,
                  So shoulde we be but one:
                  In fayth and loue, in Chist aboue,
                  And vnto Christ alone.
               
               
                  Leading a lyfe without all stryfe,
                  In quyet rest and peace,
                  From enuye and from malyce both,

                  Which if we doo then shall we shew,

but in thy manifolde mercyes, which haste promised to beare our Prayers, and graunt our requestes, which we shal make to the in the name of thy beloued sonne Iesus Christe our Lorde: who hath also coÃÑmaunded vs to assemble ourselues together in his name, with ful assurance that he wil not only be amongst vs, but also be our mediator, and aduocate towards thy maiestie, that we may obteyne all thinges which shall seme expedient to thy blessed will for oure necessities: therfore we beseche thee, most mercifull Father, to turne thy louyng countenaunce towards vs, and impute not vnto vs our manifold sinnes and offences, wher by we iustly deserue thy wrath & sharp punishmeÃÑt: but rather receyue vs to thy mercy for Iesus Christes sake, accepting his death and passion, as a iust recompence for all our offeÃÑces, in whom only thou art pleased, and through whom thou canst not be offended with vs. And seing that of thy great mercyes, we haue quietly passed this nyght, graunte (O heauenly father,) that we may bestowe thys day wholly in thy seruice, so that al our thoughts, wordes, and dedes, may redounde to the glorye of thy name, and good ensample to all men, who seeyng oure good workes, may gloryfye thee oure heauenly father. And for as much as of thy mere fauour, and loue, thou hast not onely created vs to thine owne similitude and likenes, but also haste chosen vs to be heyres with thy deare soÃÑne Iesus Christ of that immortal kingdom which thou preparedst for vs before the beginning of the worlde, we beseche thee to encrease oure faythe and know ledg, and to lighten our harts with thy holy spirit



that we may in meane time, liue in godly conuersatyon and integritie of lyfe: knowing that Idolaters, adulterers, couetous men, coÃÑtentious persoÃÑs drunkards glottons, and such like: shall not in herite the kyngdome of God.
               And because thou hast commaunded vs to pray one for another, we doo not only make request (O Lord) for ourselues, and them that thou hast alreadie called to the true vnderstanding of thy heauenly wil: but for all people and Nations of the world who as they knowe by thy wonderfull workes: that thou art god ouer al: So they may be instructed by thy holy spirite, to beleue in thee theyr only Sauior and redemer. But for as much as they caÃÑ
                  not beleue except they heare, nor can not heare but by preachyng, and none can preache, excepte they be sent, therfor (O Lorde) raise vp faithfull destributers of thy misteries, who setting apartal worldly respectes, may bothe in their life and doctryne, only seeke thy glorye. Contrarylye confound Sathan, Antichriste, with all hierlinges, whom thou hast already cast of, into a reprobate seÃÑce: that they may not by sectes, schismes, heresies, and errours disquiet thy littell flocke. And because (O Lorde) we be fallen into the latter dayes, & daungerous tymes, wherin ignoraunce hathe gotten the vpper hande, and Sathan by his ministeres seke by all meanes to quenche the light of thy Gospel, we besech the to maintaine thy cause against those rauening wolues, and strengthen all thy seruauntes whom they keepe in prison and bondage. Let not thy long suffryng be an occasion, either to encrease theyr tirannye, or to discourage thy childreÃÑ, nether



yet let our sinnes and wickednes be a hinderance to thy mercies, but with spede (O Lorde) consider these great miseries. For thy people Israel many times by theyr sinnes prouoked thine anger, and thou punishedst them by thy iust iudgemente, yet though their sinnes wer neuer so greuous, if they once returned from their iniquitie, thou receiuedst them to mercye. We therfore, moste wretched synners, be wayle our manifolde sinnes, and earnestly repent vs for our former wickennes and vngodly behauior towards thee: and where as we cannot of our selues purchase thy pardon, yet we humblie beseche thee, for Iesus Christes sake, to shew thy mercyes vpon vs, and receyue vs agayne to thy fauour. Graunt vs, deare father these oure requests and all other thinges necessary for vs, & thy whole churche, according to thy promise in Iesus Christ our Lorde. In whose name we beseche thee as he hath taught vs, saying: Oure father. &c.
