And how god is offended greuously and in many maners by them / and that by the same dyuers go vnto dampnacyon. The whiche treaty hathe ben extraught out of his boke intytuled ye crysten relygyon / and hathe ben translated out of laten in to Frensshe / and vysyted at Parys by foure venerable doctours in the faculte of Theologye / whiche haue added and dymynysshed that the whiche they sawe serue vnto the mater. For the whiche I Henry Watson symple of vnderstondynge / haue submytted me vnder correccyon to translate this lytell treatyse in to our maternall tongue of Englysshe for the salutacyon of ye soules of them the whiche playeth / praynge all the reders or herers of the same to haue my robuste language deuoyde of vndepured eloquence for excused.

In saynge vnto theym this the whiche foloweth. Chyldren of maledyccyon & replete with malice your iniquyte knoweth that of my nature and condycyon I am besy aboute the perdyccyon of soules / & apperteyneth also by myn offyce to procure the dystruccyon of the crysten fayth / & fynde newe inuencyons for to brynge the soules vnto dampnacion eternal. And after this that I haue longly & profoūdly thought I haue ymagyned and founde amongest the other a subtyll inuencyon by the whiche we may easely wynne and drawe vnto vs ye moost parte of ye worlde that we haue loste in the baptysme of crist. you wote and I also by your report dyabolyque that our aduersary cryste hathe constytued in the erthe a chirche for ye good by the meane of the whiche we lese our men that were almoost all oures / and now they dymynysshe gretely / for the whiche it behoueth me to constytute & reyse vp a chirche contrary for the euyll / by ye whiche I may wynne them. And vnto the ende I wyll that all ye thinges ordeyned in his sayd chirche for welthe and to the honoure of god and salute of the soules be ordeyned in myne for yll / in dyspyte of god / and for the perdyccyon of soules.

Item in lyke wyse in the chirche of god there is a manuell / also in our cursed chirche ful of iniquyte the manuell shall be that the player shal robbe his fader or moder / or some other of his kyn̄e / or yf his wyfe haue some good Iewell he shall take it / and the dysmes and the dettes abyde vnpayed / and the testamentes of the deed are not accomplysshed. Item there lacketh ye stole / that is that after that the vnhappy player shall haue pylled and robbed his kynnesmen & frendes he shall robbe some straunger / by the whiche shall be gyuen vnto hym a halter for to be hanged and strangled.

The clothe of the alter shal be the grene tapyssery or other clothe / and the chalyce shal be the boxe that the parte of them that snoffeth the candell is put in. As for the messes & sacryfyces. Euen so sayd Lucyfer as in the chirche of our aduersarye the preest beginneth Introybo and maketh his confession Also myne introybo and my confessyon shall be the inuentour of them that gothe playe. One vnhappy player and hasardoure shal come in the mornynge inuent his semblable saynge vnto hym wylte thou not come / knoweth thou not that the other are before. Ha ha answereth ye other I haue not herde masse. Care not therfore

sayeth the inuentoure thou shalt go another tyme / And ryght often the vnhappy wretches maketh theyr partyes on the saterdaye for the sondaye / to the ende yt all the iourney be gyuen vnto my dampnable seruyce. Then after the preest gothe vnto the alter for to saye ye introyte / and there is knowen wherof the masse shalbe Also the introyte of my seruyce dampnable is that the players shal saye / playe we at the romfle / the other shal saye playe we at the tryumphe. And euen soo as in the chirche of god there is seuen masses more comon than ye other as afore is sayd. Semblably in my chirche there is seuen specyalles / whiche is / the mōmom / the gleke / the flusshe / the torment / the regnet / one and thyrty / and ye tryumphe. Item there is also at ye masse of cryst Kyrieleyson that is asmoche for to saye as who said vnto god / lorde gyue vs mercye / whiche is a songe & orayson ryght fayre that is sayd and pronounced thryes. iij tymes that is .ix. tymes / in the name and reuerence of the trynyte and of the .ix. ordres of aungelles. But at ye Kyrie of my chirche shall be spoken & pronounced blasphemes vpon blasphemes. For the one shall swere by the bloode of god / the other by the flesshe / the other by ye wombe / the other by the heed / the other by the body / ye other by the dethe / and consequently of the other. And ryght so as in the chirche of god all the preestes whan they haue songe the Kyrye alone they ende all togyder with one accorde and tune / euenso ryght often the players renyeth god / or blasphemeth horrybly all togyder in suche wyse that it semeth to be myn helle / as it is for to speke proprely. For ryght so as paradyse is there as god is / in lyke wyse there as yt deuyll is / is helle. Item

sayd lucyfer in the masse of god there is Gloria in excelsis in dyuers tunes after ye dyuersyte of ye feestes. Euē so I wyll yf it be the feest of god that he be renyed / & yf it be the feest of his moder yt she be blasphemed / yf it be the feest of ony sayntes that they be dyspyted and iniuryed. Item euen so as there is oraysons y• is sayd hertly / also the oraysons of y• players shall be syghes yt they shall make hertly whan they haue loste / & in wepynge is almoost in dyspayre. Item there is the pistyl that is sayd in remembraunce of ye good men of the tyme past Also the pystyll of my chirche shall be the recordacyon of ye players of ye tyme paste / for often my players shall saye. By the dethe suche one was a nymble player / for whan he came to playe he had but fyue shyllynges and wanne a ryall / suche one coude nothynge lyke hym for he loste ten nobles & his gowne in one nyght. Nor su

Now let se who shal haue ought / loke there the deuyllyshnes More ouer there is the grayll of my fendysshe chirche. That shall be the synnes yt the players cōmytteth from degree to degree / from auaryce to rapyne / from rapine to vsurye / from vsurye to leynge / frome leynge to blasphemynge / and so of the other / in suche wyse that I haue made fyftene pyttes for to make the cursed players dyscende in to my helles. Item there is the gospel that is asmoche for to saye as good messenger. The player prayeth god somtyme saynge / I praye god my felowe that thou mayst lese. The other answereth I pray our lady the whiche is aboue in heuen that I may wynne O how the vnhappyes are cursed to pray god that he

helpe them to wynne to theyr dampnacyon / and in seruynge the deuyll. Item sayd Lucyfer there is the Crede. That is that the players bileueth that they shal not deye. There hathe ben dyuers that hathe ben seke vnto the dethe / but wt grete payne they were heled whan they retourned vnto the playe agayne. And somtyme in theyr sekenes for to recouer helth they fynde not more gretter consolacyon for to passe the tyme than to playe at dyce and at cardes / or to go from tauerne to tauerne / or frome bordell to bordell there as it noyeth theym not as to praye for theyr synnes / or saye dyryge for / all crysten soules. As it appereth by a man of the chirche yt was seke whiche demaunded counsayll of a doctoure yf he were not excused for to saye his dyuyne seruyce / for bycause sayd he yt his heed aked whan he sawe hys portoys. And euery daye he was thre or els foure houres playnge at dyce and at cardes / and doynge the seruyce of Lucyfer. After folowynge there is at the masse the offrynge whan the preest offreth to god the breed & the wyne. Also in my chirche dyabolyque al that ye whiche is brought to the playes prohybytes and defended is offred in my name & for my seruyce. Now how many may be foūden that wolde not offre fyue shyllynges to god

Faders and moders oughte for to kepe them well from gyuynge theyr chyldren ought to offre to ye deuyl Item in my chirche sayd Lucyfer there is secrete oraysons. That is the grete ire / dyspyte / and sorowe that ye players haue whiche knaweth theyr consciences. The preface shall be the lamentacyons that the players make after that they haue loste. Alas shall one saye I am

wel vnhappy I haue loste a noble as moche as I haue wonne this fortenyghte. And the other answereth hym. proficiat vobis. without hauynge pyte on his felowe no more than on a dogge. Item the preest at the masse of god maketh crosses. Also the cursed player sō

And shall not anoye and wery them so moche as to be one houre in the chirche of god. Also to the ende that my chirche fayle not / and bycause that dyuers of our offycers maye happen deye I wyll that the chyldren loke vpon theyr faders that playe and seruauntes theyr maysters / & so of other degrees as well the aūcyentes as other / to the ende that they take pleasure in it / and that they may lerne and contynually vpholde it. Ryght so as in the chirche of god the chyldren lerne of the auncyent men for to vpholde the seruyce of cryst after theyr dethes.

               ¶The seconde partye.
               
                  COme we now vnto the seconde partye in ye whiche it behoueth to se and speke of the instrumentes and apparayl of the chirche diabolyke in the whiche is the ordynaunce yt foloweth. And Lucyfer sayd. I ordeyne the instruments and apparayll of my chirche. And fyrst bycause that in the chirche of our aduersary cryst there is a messe boke for to saye masse / euen soo in oures there lacketh one / & I ordeyne that it shall be the dyce. For ryght so as in ye messe booke of the chirche of god there is .xxi. lettres by the whiche the crysten men and women knoweth the wyl of theyr creatour / also in the dyce that is our messe boke there shall be .xxi. poyntes by the whiche al my seruauntes the players shall knowe my wyll. Upon thys poynt one may demaunde how one may knowe ye cursed and dampnable wyll of Lucyfer and to whome he hathe reueled it. Answer that to a Senatour of Rome the whiche was of so peruers and euyll gouernynge / that by his glotony and lubrycyte he became lazar and pudacre. And whan he sawe that they separed hym frō the company of the other he was so vnpacyent that he swore that he sholde venge hym on god. And one daye after dyuers blasphemes he thoughte how he myghte do some thynge in dyspyte of god and of crystendome / anone came the deuyll of helle to hym in the forme of a blacke man and demaunded hym what hym ayled. He answered that he was halfe madde & that he thoughte and sought how he myght do ony thynge agaynst god for the perdyccyon of soules. Then the deuyl presented

hym a dyce and sayd vnto hym. If thou wylt do that ye whiche I shall tell the thou shall be cause of the dampnacyon of innumerable soules. And what sayd he. It is that thou playe with this dyce here & lerne ye other for to playe. And whan yt in playnge there cometh one poynt thou shall saye in dyspyte of god. Whan there cometh twayne / thou shalt saye in dyspyte of god and of his moder. Whan there cometh thre / thou shalt saye in dyspyte of the trynyte. Whan there cometh foure / thou shalte saye in dyspyte of the foure euangelystes. Whan there cometh fyue / thou shalte saye in dyspyte of ye fyue woundes of cryst. Whan there cometh syxe / thou shalt saye in dyspyte of the syxe solempne feestes of ye chirche of god. There is the inuencyon of ye dyce. And after lucyfer said euen so as in the messe boke of our aduersary there is many and dyuers messes / for all that there is seuen moost comon that the ygnoraunte preestes saye. The sondaye of the trynyte / the mondaye of all soules / The tewesdaye of aungelles. The wednysdaye of all sayntes. The thursdaye of the holy ghost. The frydaye of the crosse. The saterdaye of Marye our aduersarye. Thus sayd Lucyfer to sathan. Thou shalte haue in dyspyte of all the soules in purgatory the masse of monday Thou belzebub in dyspyte of the aungelles thou shalte haue the masse of tewesdaye. Thou astaroth in dyspyte of al the sayntes in paradyse thou shalt haue ye masse of wednesdaye. Thou asmodeus in dyspyte of the holy goost yu shalte haue ye masse of thursdaye. Thou mammona in dyspyte of the passyon of cryst our enemy thou shalt haue the masse of frydaye. Thou belphegor in dyspyte of Marye our aduersary thou shalt haue ye masse

of saterdaye. And I sayd Lucyfer wyll reteyne that of sondaye in dyspite of the trynyte of paradyse. For vnto me apperteyneth the moost solempnell. Upon this poynt is to be noted that whan one wyll make a masse to be sayd he ought to make it to be sayd of the daye / or elles let the preest doo it after his deuocyon. And here is as of the messe booke. ¶After sayd Lucyfer euen so as there is in the chirche of cryst a portoys for to saye matynes and euensonge. Also I wyll haue one in my chirche / and ordeyne that it shall be the cardes. And ryghte so as in the portoys of our aduersarye there is dyuers hystoryes / as the hystorye of the natyuyte / of the resurreccyon / of kynges and dyuers other / in lyke wyse wyl I that there be pompous hystoryes in oures / as kynges / quenes / and varlettes. I wyll more ouer that my storyes haue grete sygnyfycacyons also wel as they of cryst. They that are paynted within sygnyfyeth ye auaryce and cupidite of the cursed players. And those of ye kynges sygnyfyeth pryde inobedyence & arrogaunce. They of the quenes lecherye and lubrycyte. Those of ye foles the grete foly of ye players that weneth to wynne a thynge transytorye / and leseth the rychesses eternalles. And those of the varlettes sygnyfyeth that the players are s
                     •
                  ruaūtes of me Lucyfer. Upon this poynt is to be noted as sayeth saynt Ambrose. He is reputed seruaunte of the mayster that dothe his operacyons. The cardes with paynted hertes sygnyfyeth that they whiche playe haue gyuen theyr hertes vnto the playe & vnto the deuyll. And those there as is the trafles sygnyfyeth the folysshe ioye that they take in seruynge lucyfer. They of pyckes sygnyfyeth the noyses and debates ye
                  
procedeth. And those of dyamondes sygnyfyeth that ye chirche infernall shall be paued with theyr soules. Loo here as touchynge the portoys. And is to be noted that dyuers saye whan they are rebuked for playnge at cardes that they doo it but for to passe the tyme / and for to take recreacyon. But thou player I demaunde the yf thou founde a booke in thy chambre / and were well sure that the deuyll had composed it yf thou wolde passe the tyme for to rede in that boke. I byleue that nay / & yt thou sholde not be wel tyll that it were out of thy hous Be ye sure & certayne that the deuyll of helle hathe made and composed the dyce and the cardes. And my lorde saynt Bernardyn wolde not haue sayd and preched it / nor lefte it by wrytynge yf he had not ben well informed. And therfore euenso as they that make / sell / & bye bokes for to saye the dyuyne seruyce may be called the lybrayres of god. Semblably they and those that ma
                     •
                  ke sell and bye the cardes wherwith they do make the seruyce of the deuyll may be called the lybrayres of the deuyll. And yf they saye that we wyll confounde them and dyshonoure. Answer. But clene the contrarye / we wyll reyse / honoure / and saue them. It appereth. yf o
                     •
                  ne were in ye seruyce of a hangman / and that his frende purchaced hym an honest offyce in the courte of the kynge / he sholde do hym grete pleasure and honoure. / Ryght so wyll we drawe them out of the seruyce of the hangman of helle suche makers / sellers / & byers of cardes and purchase and put them in to the seruyce of the kynge eternell the whiche reygneth in heuen. And after that Lucyfer sayd vnto his complyces infernalles / the whiche were aboute hym makynge greate Ioye.

In the chirche of cryst there is the auter / also for oure alter shal be the tables. And as afore the alter of our aduersarye there is a lytell wyndowe for to put the relyques in / in lykewyse shall we haue a sachell tyed to the tables for to put the dyce and ye table men therin. And also as there is alters portatyues in the chirche of god Semblably we shall haue tables portatyues for the ladyes whan they go on sportynge. And after sayd Lucifer in the chirche of cryst there is ye vestementes. Fyrst there is an amyt that they put on the heed / ryght so the amyt of my chirche shall be ygnoraunce and blyndnes of the players / for they haue no conscyence of nothyng and careth not for ony thynge that is tolde them. It is certayne semblable that they confesse theym not / in soo moche as they retorne after theyr confessyon vnto it agayne. And somtyme it happeneth that the fader and the moder repreueth theyr chylde / and for all that they do but mocke them / and haue no conscyence nor fere of god. Item sayd lucifer there is a whyte aube by ye whiche is sygnyfied that dyuers oftentymes playeth theyr gownes / and wereth bicause of the playe theyr shyrtes knotted vpon theyr sholders. Item there is a gyrdell that holdeth the aube. This gyrdell here in my chirche is the grete affeccyon that draweth the players to the playe and that holdeth my seruauntes for to do my seruyce. It is a grete thynge of the dysordynate affeccion of a player / somtyme he shall ryse oute of his bedde / or shall departe from the chirche and leue the dyuyne seruyce whan his felowe maketh hym ony sygne. ¶And how well yt the sayd player hath moche werke on hande and that he hathe promysed to yelde it at a certayne

For whyles that they playe yf one cryed take ye theues none of the players wolde flee / for they are theues domestiques. But for to speke more proprely this rapyne is myxt with treason / for it is cōmytted oftentymes in etynge & drynkynge the one with the other. This cruelte is ryght often amonge the players / for the one wold

                  self. And of suche is veryfyed the holy scrypture ye sayth Ue qui predaris nonne et tu predaberis ipse. That is to saye / cursed player that robbeth the other shalt thou not be robbed. There is dyuers that hath played theyr wyues gownes and kyrtylles / and other good Iewelles that they myght gete. And wolde haue played more yf they myght haue goten more / in whiche they haue not lesse synned. Bycause that god loketh not alonely at the werke of the synner / but at the wyl of ye sinner the whiche is reputed for the dede. And therfore as vnto god that knoweth the hertes and voluptuous wyl

                  les reputeth it for rapyne. Unde .xiiij.q.v.c. Si quis. is sayd that god interrogeth not alonely the hande but y• herte. ¶The thyrde spere is vsurye ryght grete / for it abydeth not a yere nor a halfe / nor a moneth / nor also a hole daye. yf one receyue for a hondred nobles that he hath lente / a hondred and .x. or a .C.v. at the yeres ende is sayd and reputed an vsurer. What shall one saye of hym that gothe to playe with ten nobles / & in playnge receyueth thyrty that same day. Certaynly it appereth that it is a grete vsurye. For the whiche he may not reteyne it for hym / but is holden to restore it in certayne

Somtyme at the playe one lenneth syluer for to haue prouffyte / but they say it is but for to laughe / how well that it is a greate synne as towarde god. Of this we haue the decretall of excessibus prelatorum / y• begynneth. Inter dilectos / where as is made mencyon how the

               ¶The fourthe is multitudo mendaciorū pernisiorum At the playes is many lesynges and specyally mortall For to deceyue and begyle his nexte felowe. Players haue no conscyence.

And to the ende that they byleue the better theyr lesinges they conferme thē by othes. And in that wyse they are forsworne. ye whiche is alwayes deedly synne / at ye leest whan they swere voluntaryly. For somtyme they swere agaynst trouthe by god by my fayth. &c. there is as moche and as of ten in rekenynge of theyr game. And all this it behoueth to tell at the artycle of the dethe / and at the iugement of god euenso as it is wryten mathei .xij. de om̄i verbo ocioso quod locuti fuerint homines reddent racionem in die iudicij. If it be so that we muste yelde account of the pronounced wordes / what shal it be of the lesynges / swerynges / blasphemynges / of mockynges detraccyons / and so forthe of the other. And more ouer

not alonely they yt playe telleth lesynges / but also they that beholde them. As in the place of the tenysplay there shall be well a hondred persones durynge the euensonge and sermon. And god vnoweth how many lesinges / detraccyons / swerynges and blasphemynges there is sayd and done / they are innumerable. And ye players shall saye it is aboue the corde / another shall saye I reporte me vnto suche one. And they shal iuge wronge somtyme for hate / or for couetyse bycause that they haue waged on theyr hedes. It is no meruayl yf y• players dampne them / for oftentimes they that beholdeth them offendeth god the creatour / alonely in soo moche as they lese the tyme / and becometh necligent & slouthfull in good operacions / and will go to the tauerne. ¶The fyfth spere dicitur fons blasphemie at

Who someuer blasphemeth sayeth he the name of god let him be put to dethe / as to the body dethe corporel / and as of the soule yf he do not penaunce dethe infernall▪ And somtyme agaynst suche folkes god hathe made horryble Iugementes.

For by the fyrst worde that is sayd deseruiēs is gyuen vs to vnderstonde that yf they be not accustomed

they shall not bere the sayd payne after the glose. / How well yt they synne mortally in playnge as sayeth mayster Raymon / and mayster Anthony of Florence / in his somme sayeth that how wel that some hath wylled to saye that it is no mortal synne to playe saue whā they accustome them / whiche is not true. For how wel sayeth he that the custome greueth the synne / for al yt it meueth not the spyce or gendre of synne. For it maketh not of a synne venyall a synne mortall as sayeth saynt Thomas. As the sinne of dronkennes / to the whiche ye playe is compared as vnto the sayd payne / the whiche is deed

                  y synne for to cōmytte it one tyme wyttyngly / how be it yt he hathe not yet the payne / saue whan one is accustomed for to be dronken and vse the same. By ye seconde worde scilicet desinat is gyuen vs to vnderstā
                  de that how well that he is accustomed for to playe he ought to be admonested / and after yt he hathe ben warned yf he wyll cesse he shall eschewe the payne. But he ought to do penaunce for the synne that he hathe done in playnge. By the other wordes dampne
                     •
                  ur & cōmunione priuetur / is gyuen vs to vnderstande ye playnge at the playes aboue sayd is deedly synne and wel greuous. One may proue it in this manere / none maye be deposed or cursed saue for deedly synne. By the chapytre. Nemo episcoporum .xi.q.iij. Now it is so yt the player at the tables ought to be deposed or accursed after the canon aboue said. Ergo it foloweth that it is deedly synne / seynge also that suche playe is defended in lykewyse by the lawe cyuile / and lawes of the paynyms and infydeles. As it appereth in the dygestes in the tytle of alee lusu & aleatoribus. And syth by newe constytucyon

made by the emperour Iustynyan the whiche begynneth. Alearū vsus wryten in code in the ende of the rubrysshe of religiosis et sūptibus funerū. And not content with this defendeth it yet agayne in the volume & booke of autentyques in the tytle of sanctissimis episcopis at the paragraphe interdicimus in the .ix. collacyon / and that is also put and alegged in the sayd code in the tytle of episcopis et cle. And begynneth also ye sayd autentyque interdicimus where as it is textually defended not for to playe / and not to be partaker of the playe / and that more is for to beholde playe. It is semblably defended by the droyt canon and holy decrete in dyuers passages. And in lykewyse in the chapytre clerici officia. at the paragraphe. Ad aleas et taxillos non ludant nec huiusmodi ludis intersint de vita & honestate clericorum in antiquis. And vpon this paas is to be noted after the doctours that the playe of tables maye be called all game that is ioyned and subgecte to fortune pryncypally. How well that it is medled with craft as the playe of dyce and the playe of cardes / and other lyke. And therfore the texte in the sayd autentyque interdicimus / vseth of this terme and worde. tabulas / & the other droyts aboue alegged of this worde alea. Note that our lorde sayeth in the gospell luce decimo. Qui vos spernit scilicet prelatos ecclesie in suis ordinationibus me spernit. Sayeth oure lorde in spekynge to his dyscyples and to theyr successours / they yt whiche myspryseth you that is for to say the prelates of the chirche in theyr ordeynaūces / they myspryse me & contēpneth / What is it for to myspryse & contempne ye commaūdemētes of our moder holy chirche. Certaynly it is a grete

sinne as it appereth clerly in the holy decrete Si qui lxxxi. distinctione vbi dicit gregorius. Paganitatis peccatum incurrit quisquis dum cristianum se esse asserit sedi appostolice obedire contemnit. Sayeth saynt gregory yt in euery body renneth ye synne of a paynim whā he sayeth he is crysten not obeyenge the chirche.
               ¶The .ix. spere is perditio temporis. That is that the players leseth theyr tyme inutylly and all the goodes yt they myght do. How wel that dyuers ryottours not carynge for theyr salute make not grete estymacyon. For all that the prudentes that beholdeth the euyll yt is done / and the welth that is lefte vndone / hathe therof grete conscyence / & suche maner of folke consydereth not ye valoure of the tyme / the shortnes of it irreuocable. The precyousnes of the tyme is soo grete that in lytell space a man may haue remyssyon of his synnes / purchace ye grace of god / and acquyre the glorye of paradyse. And therfore sayeth seneca. Nulla maior iactura

Ha pore and myserable synner affusked how shalte thou yelde accountes of the tyme that god hathe lente and gyuen the for to do penaunce and good werkes. The whiche thou haste euylly employed in seruynge ye deuyll of hel as well on the daye as on the nyght festes and holydayes. Certaynly thou shalte answer therfore greuously. For as sayeth saynt bernarde. Om̄e tēpus tibi impēsū reqirer̄ a te q̄liter sit expēsū. & yet.

That is for to saye that we must yelde accountes of ye tyme yt hathe ben gyuen vs in this worlde here. Iob ye holy man consyderynge this / & how the men abusyng them of ye tyme that is

                  ente them for to saue theyr soules sayd in wepynge. Sedit homini locum penitencie et ipse abutitur eo in superbiam. Iob viceumoquarto. God sayeth he hathe gyuen vnto the man the tyme presente / not for to playe and lese it vycyously / but for to do penaunce. And he wasteth it in pryde / invanyte and in all synnes. Item these folkes thynke not on the shortenes of the tyme of this present lyfe. Of the whiche Iob speketh quartodecimo capitulo. Breues dies hominis sunt. The dayes of man are shorte and sone passed. Certaynly they are ryght shorte / for whan we shall be at ye dethe it shal seme vs to haue lyued lesse than an instant And therfore sayeth saynt Austyn. Omnia tēpora eternitati comparata quan punctus sunt. All the tyme sith the begynnynge of the worlde tyll vnto the ende compared to the eternyte that we shall haue after this lyfe present is but one poynt. Item they consyder not also yt the tyme passed is irreuocable and shall neuer retorne. O yf ye vnhappy dampned & reproued synners myght recouer one houre of theyr tyme loste after that they haue talled and felte the ryght horryble / intollerable / and eternall paynes of helle from whiche they shall neuer departe. What dylygence thynkest thou that they wolde make to thynke on theyr synnes / to testefye them / & confesse them / and to crye mercye / and for to reconsyle them vnto god in purpose to be soner casten in to a furneyse brennynge / than euer to retourne to playe defended / or retourne to synne. But as sayeth the prouerbe.

Foles do not bileue / tyl they receyue greue. And therfore after the doctryne of saynt poule ad gala .ii. Operemur bonum non dicit ludum dum tempus habemus. Make we sayd he good werkes / he sayd not playe we at the cardes whyles that we haue the tyme. Thou sayeth that thou muste passe the tyme. Alas ye dampned that are in helle wherwith passe they the tyme. Certaynly to bayne them within the furneyse of fyre of helle. Thynke that & ye soules of purgatory were in this lyfe how they wolde occupy ye tyme in wepynge theyr sinnes and doynge penaunce. We take no regarde therto wherfore yll shall come to vs.
               ¶The .x. spere is fraudes et falsitates. Comonly there is but fraudes and deceytes in these cursed playes. Ieremie nono. Loquitur pacem cum proximo & in occulto ponit insidias. They shall saye playe we truely. But in theyr hertes they haue wyll for to begyle eche other in hydynge the cardes / in castynge awaye the dyce / in rekenynge / in gyuynge false money the whiche is mortall synne. As it is sayd extra de furtis et vicesima quinta distinctione in ye chapytre vnum orarium propterea ieremias dicit vnusquis

               ¶The .xi. spere sunt ire et rixe. It is noyses & debates. one shall saye suche one hathe wonne my money / shall I neuer loue hym / he is cause that I am a poore man. And reproches so many that it is meruayll with noyses that of it procedeth. Somtyme they shal pul them-demaunded

forgyuenes of our lorde / and dyde soo moche by wepynges & lamentacions yt he founde mercy anenst god / and was delyuered frome the enemye. And then incontynent he came vnto ye preest that sawe these thre thynges by experyence as he recoūted to ye sayd saynt Bernardyn / in many festynge and declarynge ye case as it was happened hym. And in wytnesse therof he shewed hym his sholdres greuously wounded / and his confessyon herde deyed two dayes after. In thys maner dyuers haue fallen in dyspayre.
               ¶The .xiij. is adoratio stulta. This is a folysshe adoracyon / for the player maketh of the playe his god / in soo moche as he hathe leuer lese the grace of god than to leue playenge. And often for the loue that he hath to playe he is contente to transgresse the cōmaūdementes of god. For as sayeth my lorde saynt Austyn in the booke named de doctrina cristiana. Illud ab homine colitur quod preceteris diligitur. That is for to saye yt the whiche thou loueth moost / and to whome thou obeyeth soueraynly thou maketh it thy god. The dyce sayth whā thou playeth that thou hast loste / paye / leue thy money with suche one / and thou dothe it. And in lykewyse of cardes whan thou leseth thou payeth. I demaūde the yf thou obey vnto god soo lyberally. God byddeth the yt thou make restytucyon of that whiche thou hathe of others / that thou gyue almesse to the poore / and thou do the nothynge. Wyll ye knowe the grete folye of ye players / and how promptly they obey to the dyce and to ye cardes theyr ydolles. The blyssed saynt Martyn that was ryght lyberal for the loue of god gaue but halfe of his mauntell. But the cursed players gyueth it hole for

the dyce and the cardes. And somtyme gowne and doblet / and to the ende that he be knowen that he is of ye lyueray of the deuyl he gothe all naked as his mayster that is all naked. And that wors is he gyueth often y• y• is not his / for he boroweth by vsurye that ye whiche he hathe not / and robbeth his neyghbour / and more ouer one may knowe how the players are foles and vnwytty. For as it is thus that the vnderstandynge of ye man is ryght noble / for all he submytteth hym to obey to the bone of a dogge / and byleue his iugement. And notwt
                  standynge he wolde not byleue the sentence of Iohan-Andrewe / or some other wel famed doctours without appellacyon / as he dothe at the sentence of his iuge the dyce / or ye cardes / whiche seeth not / hereth not / nor speketh not. And yet he dothe more gretter honour to thre dyce / or to a payre of cardes than he dothe to the humanyte of our lorde / for often at the playe he is vsurped & blasphemed. And therfore our lorde in complaynynge hym of the players sayeth in this maner by the mouthe of the prophete royall Dauyd. Foderunt manus meas et pedes meos. &c. They haue perced my fete & my handes / and haue put me in suche estate that one maye tell al my rybbes and bones. Note poore myserable player yf thou were a good crysten man whan there sholde be nothynge elles to withdrawe the from suche playe saue onely the gowne of thy redemptoure that was played at the game of sorte as it is wryten. Supervestem meam miserunt sortem. / it sholde be a suffycyent cause to absteyne you from suche playes / and to haue abhomynacyon to playe / make / sell / or bye dyce and cardes / or other lyke.
               
                  ¶The fourtynth spere is ocij nutrimentum. That is nourysshynge of vnlustynes / vnder the vmbre too be not vacabunde. yf a man wyl be perfytely vnthryfty ye nede not but to put hym to folowe the playes / for sythe euer after he shall be vnthryfty at ye werke / you se it by ye experyence of dyuers / they can not abyde halfe a day at werke. Semblably of the chyldren that wyll not lerne no crafte. Osyuyte is tho that dyuers haue but lytel conscyence of after saynt Bernarde nutrix viciorum et totius inimica virtutis. The playes are ye nourysshynge of slouthfulnes & enemye of all vertues as it is wryten in ye .xij. chapytre of ye prouerbes. He is ryght folysh ye foloweth slouthfulnes / & in ezechiel in the .xvj. chapytre. The cause of the iniquyte of Sodome was pryde / glotony / auaryce / and slouthe / as rote of all the euylles that is proceded.
               ¶The .xv. & laste spere is turpis et infamisvita. This life is vyle and abhomynable. For they that accustome them for to playe becometh dronkerdes and harlottes and haue no cure of theyr wyues nor of theyr chyldren And shortly they are in the indygnacyon of god and opprobyte of the men as sayeth the psalmyste. Opprobrium hominum & abiectio plebis And consequently they do agaynst the fyrste cōmaundement of droyt. That is for to wyt to lyue honestly without hurtynge of other / in yeldynge vnto his neyghbour and euen cristen that the whiche apperteyneth to them. As byddeth ye droyt vulgaryes.

fedebo. That is for to saye I shall not set me with the euyll / or men without pyte. Whan the men are assembled for to do some good god is in the myddes of them And whan they are assembled for some euyl god is not there but the deuyll of helle. The players comonly are not assembled saue for euyll intencyon / and also the deuyll gouerneth them and helpeth them to fyght wtoute pyte agaynst our redemptour. For there is founde but fewe palyes there as oure lorde is not offended / and ye mortally / or at the leest venyally. And ryght often that the whiche is mortell we repute often for venyall. And also the contrary. And for the venyel one shall be tormē
                  ted in the fyre of purgatory. Uenyell synne dysposeth to mortal and dymynyssheth hete in the body. For al that it putteth him not out of the charyte of god. And ryally there is so moche synne cōmytted at the playe that one maye well saye that it is a dyspraysynge of Ihesu crist And whan there sholde be none other synne but vayn swerynge and blasphemynge yet is it a grete thynge / For in as moche as is in the blasphemers they crucefye our redemptour and putteth hym to dethe. And for this thyrde mystery we haue to beholde whiche are ye folke that dampneth them by ye playes aboue sayd. Answereth my lorde saint Bernardin that there is .xij maner of folkes / that is for to wyt.

For yf thou haue wonne of ony that are not able to helpe themselfe / as is ydyottes / vnreasonable men / chyldren not of grete age / vnthrifty / relygious wedded women / seruauntes / men of the chirche yt playeth the goodes of poore folkes and other lyke / or yf yu haue induced and tyced ony for couetyse of wynnynge or yf thou haste begyled ony in playnge in gyuyng false dyce / false cardes / or mysrekenynge.

But yf ony that hathe puyssaūce for to forbere it that hathe loste at playe / and that thou haue wonne it without fraude or decepcion / thou art not holden to restore it hym. For he that hath loste it is not worthy to receyue it. And that notwithstandyng thou can not witholde it wt ryght. But ought for to departe it vnto the poore people.

               ¶The seconde that dampneth them by the playes are the kynnesmen of the players. As the fader and the moder

                   the mayster ye maystresse 
                     •
                   and pryncipally for thre reasons. The fyrste is whan they chastyse them not as they ought and are holden 
                     •
                   and therfore they are ye cause of the euyll yt they do. Secondly whan they are party felowes at the playe. It happeneth oftentymes that the moder and her chyldren are nourysshed wt the winnynge of the playes & is culpable of the synne / for they

set them on werke to the ende that they make good chere. And suche maner of folkes is bounden to make restytucyon of yt whiche they haue receyued / as it is wryten in the decretall de iniurus & damno dato in ye chapytre. Si culpa.
               ¶The thyrde reason whan they are vnpacyent. Dyuers tymes thou shalte se that the kynnesmen is so replete with vnpacyence that they curse them and gyue them vnto the deuyll / and swereth and blasphemeth / & angreth them agaynst theyr chyldren that is players / Not for ye loue of god / nor for the salute of theyr soules. But bycause they waste and dystroye the goodes of ye house. And so they fall in vnpacyence and desyreth the dethes of theyr chyldren and theyrs also / whiche is clene agaynst the commaundement of god.
               ¶The thyrde that dampneth them by the playes are the wyues and theyr chyldren. Fyrst whan they parte of the prouffyte of the playe / and restoreth it not. Right often the wyfe shall bere a pledge for to make good chere on / whiche ought not to be done. For it is comen of deuyllyshnesse / yf she had not grete necessyte. Secondly whan they are vnpacient. For dyuers curseth ye houre and the daye that they were maryed on. And oftentymes becometh noughtypackes for the playe of theyr husbandes. And thyrdly whan the chyldren playe by ye example of theyr fader and moder / specyally whan the playe is holden in theyr house. In lyke wyse ye doughters becometh harlottes. Whan they playe in a house / I demaunde the what maner of folke are they that resorteth theder. None but knaues and ryottours / whiche shall speke of rybaudrye whyles the other playeth / 

And ye maydens that are grete ye spynneth on theyr rockes besyde them shal here al this. And there shal be made dyuers dyshonest and vyllayne approchynges and occasyons of innumerable synnes. I speke not of ye maystres of the hous. Certaynly they shall come often in to thy hous vnder the coloure of waygynge / but it shal be to deceyue thy wyfe. For they shall abyde drynkyng and playnge vnto mydnyght / and then they wyl saye it is to late to go vnto theyr lodgynges lette vs haue a chambre / and all the nyghte god wote what they doo. Thou knoweth not all / yf thou be wyse take good kepe that of thy house be not made the chirche of ye deuyll And knowe for a trouthe that there is dyuers y• careth not for to lese theyr money to the ende that they may come vnto theyr enterpryse.
               ¶The fourth are they that gyueth the houses / the places / the courtes there as is made the playes. As tenys playes / and closhbankes / suche houses byeth our grete maysters / for they haue more gretter rentes bicause of the playes that is made there sayeth saynt Bernardin It semeth me that one may not fynde prouffyte in the place that is so full of iniquytes. How is it that the burgeyses wynneth / in lettynge forthe theyr houses there as is excercysed these playes dyabolyques. And that ye causeth the marchauntes to wynne in sellynge the dyce and the cardes ye tables and other playes. For they are partakers of al the euylles that foloweth. Bycause that they gyue cause and place for to commytte y• sinne in of the whiche they must yelde accouncte before god And al they also the whiche kepeth sellers where as is playng at the dice and cardes erly and late at al tymes

to the ende for to sell theyr drynke / or to haue some gaynes. And for to vnderstande ye grete yll that it is to suffre playenge in theyr houses it behoueth to loke ye fyrst lawe in the tytle aboue alegged de alee lusu et alcatoribus. in the olde digeste where as is thus said. Si quis illum verberauerit in cuius hospitio lusum est in alea. vel si dolo aliquid subtractum fuerit iudicium ei non datur. This lawe that is made by a paynym to the detestacyon of the playe sayth that whan a persone holdeth players in his house / yf it happened yt the meane whyle that the players is in his house yt he be beten or hurt or that his money be stolen out of his coffre or other godes / and yt he complayne vnto ye Iustyce / this lawe sayeth that the Iuge shall gyue hym none audyence. bycause of the detestacyon of his synne. What shal we say of them that holdeth the playes in his house. Of ye whiche foloweth so many euylles and scandales. And somtyme gothe for to fetche the players for to playe all the nyght. They playe not agaynst theyr wyll / for they maye put them oute. It sholde be another thyng of an ho

he sayd vnto ye gentylman / my lorde yf it please you / ye shal haue her out of this hous. For yf you do not I promyse you by my fayth that I shall put the fyre in ye house. And thus the lorde was constrayned to put her out. But what shall we saye of dyuers / they desyre not that theyr houses be brente / for they haue prouffyte and the grace of the lorde. ye but for all that they are in the indygnacyon of god the creatoure. Tell me what prouffyteth it the to be in the grace of this lorde that is a rybaude / harlot / and thefe. If thou be in his grace it may be that thy wyfe is his hore for all retrybucyon.

As the bones / the paper / ye colours / the moules / and thynges lyke. All these here are cause of the euylles / blasphemes / sclaundres / and vnhappynes that foloweth / and shall yelde accountes at the Iugement of god.

De penitentia distinctione quinta / the chapytre falsas the chapytre fratres / and the chapytre negocium. And they ought to denye theim the body of our lorde Ihesu cryst as they do in Almayne / and in the cyte of Myllan For whan Ester daye cometh they are expulsed & caste out of the chirche as the comon harlottes of the bordel And after whan they are deed they are sente in to ye fylthy donghyll / and there is buryed with the horses and caryen. There is some that sayeth / yf I knewe yt it were deedly synne for to make / sell / or bye the dyce and the cardes for nothynge wolde I medle therwith. Understande what our lorde sayeth. In ore duorum vel trium stat omne verbum. That is for to saye one ought to byleue the wytnes of two or thre. I aske the yf thou yede thyrty or forty myle ferre and that thou came to the entrynge of a wodde fyndynge there a lytell shepeherde y• sayd vnto the / my frende passe not thorowe the wodde wherfore good sone / for bicause that there is foure murderers yt euen nowe hathe cut the throte of a marchaūt or twayne.

And how tho it is but a lytell shepeherde that hath tolde it the / in effecte yu shalt saye for all that I wyl not put me in daunger. Now yf it be so that thou byleue a lytell shepeherde for thy lyfe corporall wherfore than byleueth thou not so many notable and holy doctours and prechers the whiche sheweth and declareth the the salute and helthe of thy soule / and thou to be so neclygent to put it in forgetynge. /

And for to declare this mater more largely we shal take a preposycyon that is wryten in the pystyll that my lorde saynt Poule sente vnto the Romayns / where as he sayeth. Prouidentes bona non solum coram deo sed etiam coram omnibus hominibꝰ. ad ro .xij. That is to saye yt for to haue paradyse it suffyseth not to be goode before god / but to doo good werkes before the people. Upon the whiche wordes saye we one preposycion generall and note it for it toucheth euery estate / and specyally theym that medle with dyce and cardes. I byleue yf you vnderstande it well you shall knowe the greate perylles that you are in / and the euyl that you do. The preposycyon is suche. Euery body that hathe desyre for to deye well and that hathe wyl for to come vnto ye glory of paradise is holden and bounden vpon the payne of mortal synne to lyue so vertuously that it gyue none occasion nor knowlege to his cristen broder to offende god mortally. Prouidētes bona non solum coram deo sed etiam coram omnibus hominibus. One myght speke here to the baudes yt steleth the soules of Ihesu crist from faders and moders / maysters or maistresses that sheweth euyl examples to theyr meyne / to the tayllers that maketh the dyssolute garmentes / to ye crafty men that sheweth theyr chyldren & seruaūtes to make fraudes and deceytes / and maketh them werke on the holy dayes. But come we vnto them that medleth theym to make dyce and cardes. I praye you tell me by your cō
                  scyence yf a boye or a ryottour bye a payre of cardes of you or a payre of dyce is it not wyttyngly mater for to offende god mortally / it is manyfeste. If you saye that you can not tell the experyence sheweth it openly at ye
                  
eye the grete euylles and horryble blasphemes and sinnes innumerable that is comytted euery daye. In suche maner that yf you were by them somtyme tyl mydnyght and wrote all the wordes y• yssueth out of theyr cursed mouthes / you wolde saye that with grete payn the deuyll myght fynde so many. Who is cause. It is ye cardes that thou haste solde. Now ymagyne how many soules is dampned in hell for the dyce and for ye cardes that hathe ben made at Parys / at Lyon / at Roen / and in other places. And thynke you not that it cryeth vengeaunce to god the creatoure agaynst them that is cause of theyr dampnacyon / certaynly yes. Wyl ye knowe perfytely ye euyll that foloweth of dyce and cardes Our lorde answereth. A fructibus eorum cognoscetis eos. you shall knowe them by the fruyte that they bere One knoweth not the bounte or malice of a tree by the braunches or leues / but by the fruyte yt it bereth. Now take we two trees. The fyrste shall be a harlot the whiche hathe ben in a chambre by the space of .xx. yere commyttynge her lecherye with her rybaude. And ye other tree shall be a maker of cardes or dice / or tables / and other instrumentes of playe of chaunce / the whiche sith xx. yere hetherwarde hathe alwayes made dyce & cardes / now demaunde we oure lorde and redemptoure. Lorde god tel vs yf it please you of whiche of these two you haue ben moost offended / of the harlot / or of the dyce & cardes made by this man here. I byleue yf it pleased hym for to speke yt he wolde saye. A fructibus eorum potestis cognoscere. you maye knowe it shall our lorde saye by the fruyte that is yssued therout. I wyl not cō
                  pare the operacyon of this harlot to the operacyon of

this carde maker / or maker of dyce / but the euyl that is folowed / and wyl proue that god hathe ben more offended by the cardes that hathe ben made in the house of this cardmaker / or dyce maker / thā of ye lechery of this harlot for foure reasons. The fyrste for this wretchyd harlot hath not offended our lorde but in her chambre where as she was presente. But the cardmaker / & maker of dyce is occasyon that our lorde is offended / not alonely in one house and one strete: in one parisshe / but in all the towne. And not alonely in one towne / but in Parys / in Roen / in Lyon / and in all Fraunce as well as here in this countree / and through all crystendome ferre and nere.
               ¶The seconde reason for this harlot offēdeth god but only in her lyfe / but the cardmaker and maker of dyce is occasyon that god is offended in his lyf in his dethe and after his dethe. Note cardmaker and maker of dyce whan thou shalte be in the artycle of dethe and ye one shall holde the candell in thy hande / and that the preest shall crye Ihesus my frende Ihesus / it may be that some playeth with the dyce or cardes that thou hast made and for asmoche as he leseth his money in renyeng and blasphemynge god and brekynge the cardes shall saye. All the deuylles of helle take the soule of hym that hathe made these dyce or cardes. And perauenture he shall be a man of the chirche / or relygyous / or an abbot or a bysshop.
               ¶The thyrde reason is that this harlot offendeth god onely whan she waketh / but this cardmaker / and maker of dyce are occasyon yt god is offended whan they wake / whan they slepe / whan they take theyr refeccyō
                  
whan they are in the chirche to praye god / and ye meane whyle the players gyueth hym to the deuyl and curseth hym. And ryght so as a good crysten he maye saye vnto god. Particeps factus sum omnium timentiū te. Lorde god I thanke ye of that thou maketh me perteyner of all the goodes that your seruaūtes maketh. Sē
                  blably he that medleth hym to make / sell / and bye ye dyce and the cardes may saye vnto the deuyll yt he is perteyner of all ye euylles and synnes that is cōmytted by the players.
               ¶The fourth reason is that the lechery of this harlot hathe not ben occasyon saue onely to make two persones too synne / she and her lemman. But the cardes of this cardmaker / and the dyce of this dyce maker haue not ben onely cause that two persones hathe offended god / but .xx.xxx.xl.C.M.x. thousande .C.M. and innumerable of all estates. For it is one of the gretest abusinges that domyneth to daye in crystendome.
               ¶There is dyuers abusynges pertyculerly in all estates / as in the estate of the chirche where as symony regneth / in relygyon propryete and inobedyence / amongest the nobles rapyne / in iustyce pyllynge / scratchyng and fleynge of poore people / amonge ye burgeyses vsurye / auaryce / and inhumanyte / in marchaundyse fraudes and decepcyons / amonge the crafty men lesynges forswerynges / brekynge of holydayes & so of other. But there is an abuse generall y• whiche toucheth euery estate grete and lytell / ryche and poore / wherof speketh the prophete zacharye octauo. That is ye abuse to playe at the dyce and cardes from whiche procedeth so many euylles and synnes that as the doctoures sayeth

they transgresse and breke the .x. cōmaundementes of god / they contemne the fyue commaundementes of holy chirche. By this blyndnes they commytte the seuen deedly synnes / they adnychyll the seuen gyftes of ye holy ghost. By this abuse they make irreuerence to ye holy sacrament of the chirche / they renne in the indygnacyon of god. By this abuse cometh often warres / pestylences / famynes / and mortalytes / by this abuse they lese the realme of paradyse and gothe vnto dampnacion eternall. Now thynke how many soules there is damned in helle for the abuse of playnge at the dyce and cardes. And generally al the euylles that may be thought procedeth and cometh of this abuse. I demaūde frome whens cometh at this daye so many blasphemynges agaynst god and the blyssed vyrgyn Marye / and ayenst all the sayntes of paradyse. Answereth zacharie. Ciuitas replebitur hominibus ludentibus. The cyte is replete with euyll and dampnable players / contrarye to good polyce and thynges publycke / the whiche peruerteth the good condycyons / and purchaseth the abuse to playe at the dyce and at ye cardes. Fro whens cometh so many homycydes / murdres / fyghtynge / kyllynge / murmurynge / cuttynge of legges and armes / and castynge in to the ryuer. Answereth zacharye. Ciuitas replebitur. &c. It is the abuse to playe at the dice and cardes. Fro whens cometh soo many auaryces / rapynes / vsuryes / and theftes. Answereth zacharye. It is ye abuse of playnge at the dyce & cardes. Fro whens cometh it that so many yongmen robbeth theyr kynnesmen / ye seruauntes theyr maisters and maystresses / the men of the chirche the goodes of the poore people. Answereth

zacharye. Certaynly it is the abuse of the playng of the dyce and cardes. What is the cause that so many good houses is loste / the doughters abyde vnmaryed / ye chyldren vnpuruayed. Answereth zacharye. It is the abuse at the playnge of the dyce and cardes. Fro whens cometh it that there is so many poore wedowes in grete necessyte / the orphelyns all naked that hathe not brede for to ete. Answereth zacharye. It is the abuse to play at the dyce and cardes. What is the cause of soo many glotonyes / dronkenshippes / lecheryes / aduoutries / fornycacyons / vyolacyons of yonge maydens / & ledynge vnto perdyccyon. Answereth zacharye. Ciuitas replebitur. &c. Certaynly it is the abuse to playe at the dyce / and cardes. What is the cause of so moche defylynge & settynge at nought god our creatoure and oure moder holy chirche / to breke the holydayes / and the fastes cōemaunded / lesynge the masse and euensonge / and ye sermons. Answereth zacharye. It is the abuse of playnge at the dyce & cardes. Fro whens cometh so many noyses and debates / and dyscencyons in maryage bytwene the husbande and the wyfe / it semeth yt it is an helle Answereth zacharye. It is the abuse to playe at the dyce & cardes Wherfore is it that they leue to doo almesse to paye theyr dettes / and accomplysshe the testaments of theyr kynnesmen deed / and to paye the dysmes and rentes of the chirche. Answereth zacharye. It is ye abuse to playe at the dyce and cardes. Fro whens cometh it that so many wyues are beten and hurte / yll clothed & that some of them deyeth for hongre with theyr chyldren. Answereth zacharye. It is the abuse of playnge at the dyce and cardes. Fro whens procedeth so many

hates / enuyes / yres / iniuryenge the other. Answereth zacharye. It is the abuse to playe at ye dyce and cardes What is y^ cause that soo many yongmen and sones of good houses are taken of the Iustyce / put in pryson / & hanged to the confusyon of theyr frendes. Answereth zacharye. It is the abusynge to playe at the dyce or at the cardes. Fro whens cometh it that many yong chyldren are so dyssolute and gyuen to vnthryftynes / glotons / saucy / lyers / and wyll do nothynge / are rebelles and inobedyentes to theyr frendes / & somtyme leueth in necessyte theyr faders and moders / and without takynge leue gothe ferre and nere. Answereth zacharye. Ciuitas replebitur hominibus ludētibus. It is ye abuse to playe at the dyce and cardes. And thus you se manyfestly that this abusynge maketh horryble woūdes in crystendome / and how it is cause of the perdyccyon not alonely of the goodes temporell / but also of the bodyes & soules. What remedy / what is to be done / wyll not my lordes of the chirche and gouernours of the comon welfare do for the loue of theyr god / lorde / and iuge souerayne / and for the welthe and prosperyte spyrytuell and corporel of theyr subgectes as they are straytly bounden after ye dute of theyr estates & offyces / they ought for to lese bothe etynge drynkynge and slepynge for to thynke & puruaye therfore / for it toucheth theym ryght nere / and ought to be right Ioyous to fynde some meane to deiecte & hele this horryble pestylence & abuse dampnable. Now vnderstande yf it please you / there is but one thynge as it is sayd in the decretall depenitentus et remissionibus in the chapytre. Cum infirmitas Remota causa remouetur effectus. Wyll you

make an yll tree for to dye in your garden / cut the rote of the same euyll tree and it shall bere no more yll fruyt Wyll you take awaye all the euylles and sclaundres of the whiche we haue spoken / take awaye all the dyce & all the cardes in your cytes bourghs and townes and brēne them / for it is a generall rule. A destructione cause sequitur destructio effectus. ye muste dystroye ye dyce and the cardes and the playe shall cesse / and consequently the euylles that foloweth. There is not he but that they knowe it. And it is that the whiche my lorde saynt Poule sayeth in the auctoryte aboue spoken. Prouidentes bona non tamen coram deo 
                     s
                     sed
                   etiā corā omnibus hominibus. That is for to saye that for to haue paradyse it suffyseth not to be good before god / but also to do good werkes and operacyons before the people for to shewe and teche them the ryght waye vnto paradyse as they are boūden.
               ¶The .ix. that dampneth them for the playes are they that lenneth money to a hasardoure for to playe at the dyce or at the cardes. One shal fynde soner a man that wyll lenne syluer vnto a ryottour or hasardoure / than they wyll do vnto a good man in his necessite / the whiche is an euydent and open sygne that they are the mynysters and seruaūtes of the deuyll. Shall a player saye go we to playe. His felowe shal answer I haue not a halfpeny. Take no thought shall the other saye I haue ynoughe for vs bothe. And thus for ye deuyll he shal soner lenne ten nobles than he wolde do for the loue of god ten shelynges to a good man in his grete necessite yf he sholde deye for hongre. O how it is grete yl for to lenne money to the players.

And ye vnhappy players shall let her take it with a good wyll / in saynge within theyr hertes / she wyl condyscende more soner to our requeste / she shall let her be kyssed and groped / or yf yt she maye not entende she shall sende her grete doughter / lo here is a fayre begynnynge for to be a good wyfe.
               ¶The .xj. yt dampneth them by playes are they yt abydeth for to beholde ye players / they do more gretter hurte than they wene / and byleue that all the blasphemynges / deceyuynges / lesynges / and other synnes that is cōmytted there is transported to theym that beholdeth them. For they proue ye games. How is it possyble that one may stande beside the fyre without warmyng him And therfore sayeth the wyse / ecclesiastici xiij. Qui tetigerit picem inquinabitur ab ea. That is for to saye / who that toucheth rosyn he shal be spotted or maculed And sayeth after. Qui communicat superbo induit superbiam. Who that haunteth a proude man shal become proude also. I demaunde you sayeth saynt Bernardyn who maye beholde theym that cōmytteth actuelly the synne of lecherye without beynge spotted wt synne. What is he that doubteth that he that beholdeth ye players renneth not in more gretter synne than they that beholdeth them that cōmytteth lecherye. How be it / it is so that they are parteyners of all the synnes that is done and cōmytted there / as sayeth saint Poule the appostle.

And after yt I had spoken longe to hym I demaunded hym why he was so greued / & he answered yt it was bycause yt he had taken dylectacyon in playnge in ye worlde / without confessyng it / wherfore I am depryued from the mercy of god. And after these thinges he vanysshed awaye leuynge suche a stynke behynde him yt neuer after none entred therin. By this exāple none oughte for to playe / for it dyspleaseth god moche greuously. These thynges consydered of the holy saynt Gregorye he said O petōr momētaneū ē 
                  qd delectat scz in hoc mūdo: eternū vero qd cruciat scz in inferno. Alas sayeth saint gregorye poore moūdayne all the delectacyons yt thou taketh in this myserable worlde in these playes dyabolyques in thy body in clothes dyssolute and other vices it is but a momente. Eternū vero qd cruciat but ye tormentes of helle are eternall without ende. Of the whiche paynes the holy man Iob reherseth twayne in the xxiiij. chapytre of his boke where as he sayeth. Transibunt ab aquis minū ad calorē minū. Iob sayeth that amonge ye grete paynes yt is in helle there is two horryble & meruayllous ye one is of fyre ardaūtly brēning & the other is of ysy water the whiche two paynes no tongue can expresse. And therfore sayeth saynt gregory all the strengthes of the bodyes & soules of ye wretched synners are in tho two paynes before them in augmē
                  tynge of all theyr paynes and tormentes.
               
                  Itē yf there were a stone a thousande tymes more greter than all the erthe / & that there came a byrde frome a C.M. yere. to a .C.M. yere & no soner / and that for euery tyme he toke of the stone also grete alonely as the .x. parte of a corne of whete / so yt m.x.C.M. yere he hadde not taken but a pece also grete as a corne: and that god had made promesse to a dampned yt whan the sayd stone sholde be al eten / & no soner he sholde haue not ye glorye of paradyse / but releasynge of his payne. The sayd dampned sholde be alredy dyscharged of one of ye gretest paynes of hell. That is that he sholde haue releace whan the stone were eten. But alas alas alas & a .M. tymes alas whan sholde it be. And for all y• all the dampned are deuoyde of suche truste / for they knowe wel y• that they shal neuer departe from thens. And this payne yt is dyspayre none can comprehēde. O pyteous hertes thynke profoundly where becometh youre aege / & your tyme / thynke where is your loue and your vnderstandynge. Thynke whether you are in the way of glory or in the waye of torment. And ymagyne that there is a hondred mylyons in helle that yf they had halfe an houre of ye tyme yt you haue / they wolde make suche dylygence & suche penaunce yt they sholde neuer retourne theder agayne. Alas who maye thynke the grete complayntes and lamentacyons yt they make without ceasynge for the tyme yt they haue lost / wherin they myght haue wonne paradyse. How lytell hathe lasted our ioy and pleasaunce moundayne. Alas what hathe prouffyted vs honoures / rychesses / and delytes / grete castelles / houses / dygnytees / offyces / al is passed soner than the wynde / & there is lefte vs but maledyccyon of god

myserye and torment. Cursed be the houre that we were euer borne of our moder / we haue lost the meryte of the passyon of the sauyoure / we haue loste paradyse & eternall benedyccyon. Alas god wherfore haste yu created vs cursed be the creatour / ye creature / and ye houre also of the creacyon. We are wel cursed and confoūded we maye crye longe / curse / and blaspheme / one can not conforte another / but well dysconforte O how it is an horryble thynge 
                     •
                   cruell / and to be redoubted to offende god and breke his cōmaundementes / it is to late to repente hym there. Suche lamentacyons and other like is in the songe of the vnhappy dampned / of ye estate of whome and of theyr paynes none can speke nor wryte playnly in comparyson of that whiche they suffre / but this notwithstandynge who that well beholdeth and consydereth in his herte this that is spoken in this lytell treatyse / he ought to conceyue fere yf euer by scrypture or other maner he had ony And to this purpose is founde by wrytynge that a man excessiuely moūdayne and full of all vanyte named Fulkes. Ones amonge ye other he laye in a bedde ryght softe and delycyous / but he myght not slepe as he desyred / and anoyed him that the daye came not not for to go to the masse or do some good but for to excercyse his folyes and worldely vanytes. And he beynge in suche anoye thought profoūdly in hymselfe what doloure he sholde haue yf he were condampned for to abyde there in bedde by the space of two or thre yeres without other lyght or body. And cō
                  ceyued in hymselfe that for no sōme of golde nor syluer he wolde not endure that payne and torment. And after he thought more depely what it myght be of theym

that were in purgatorye by the space of a hondred yere in sharpe fyre / & what grefe they endured in abydynge the Ioyes of paradyse. But as god wolde he thoughte more ouer on them that were dampned in helle perpe

                  tually in grete tormentes / wherof he had soo grete fere and drede that anone after he entred in to the relygion of Cistersien̄. where as he prouffyted so moche in meditacyon and perfeccyon thynkynge on ye paynes of hell that he was chosen to be the bysshop of Tholouse in ye whiche dygnyte he fynysshed his dayes ryghte holyly and wente vnto the glorye of paradyse. By this example appereth clerely the grete prouffyte yt cometh from holy medytacyon and thynkynge on the paynes of hel and of the longe contynuynge of the same the whyche prouffyte declareth the prudent.

O poore synner in all thy werkes and operacyons haue remembraunce of the houre of thy dethe / of the Iugementes of god of the paynes of helle / and of the Ioyes of paradyse and thou shalte neuer offende god. so be it. Amen.
