                  IT was my hap of late to heare,
               a pretie ieſte:

               And haſted to the Chandlers ſhop,
               his money to diſpoſe.
            
            
               But ſee the chaunce the Chandler drie,
               was gone to drinke:
               Or els poore ſoule to plaie thereby,

               Tantara, tara, tantara,
               whereat his wife did chafe:
               And out ſhe went then in a rage,
               to ſeeke her good man Rafe.
            
            
               She ranged forthe and could not reſte,
