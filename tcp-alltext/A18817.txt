            For the more speedy and certain attaining of the singular Learning contained in the same, to further to a pure Latin stile, and to expresse the mind more easily, both in English & Latine.

            TO THE RIGHT worshipfull Maister Doctour Hunton, D. of Physicke, and his most reuerend and worthily respected friend, I. B. wisheth all true happinesse in Christ both now and euermore.
            
               COnsidering with my selfe (right worshipfull) to whō I should dedicate this small part of my schoole indeauours, I could bethink me of none to whom it might be more iustly due, then to you; sith I owe vnto you euen mine owne selfe and all my later trauels: for I must needes acknowledge your vnfained loue and tender care for mee, to the glorie and praise of our blessed God, and to bind my selfe still more




vnto his heauenly Maiestie, and euen vnto your owne selfe to testifie my thankfulnesse, all my daies. Because, besides all your regarde which you haue euer had of my health, when as through long affliction by sundrie most heauie trials, and by ouer-toyling both minde and bodie (in lacke of all meet helps and means, to performe that seruice which I had entered into, and so much desired for the good both of Church and common weale) my life was become most miserable and a burden vnto me, by changing the best humors of my bodie into lumpish melancholy, it pleased him, to make you his principall instrument for my recouerie and restoring. Whereby in stead of that heauie dumpishnesse, by which I was made vnfit for my calling, and almost vtterly ouerwhelmed, as you well knowe; that our holy and most gratious God, to bee praised for euermore, hath caused me to finde euen heauen vppon the earth, so that I can againe reioice




in all my labours, and especially in my calling: by which, my ioy in him, is vnto mee indeed a continuall feast, yea my strength and health, and such a portion, as in regard whereof I can account basely of all earthly things. And secondly, for that loue and fauour, which you haue continually shewed to all my poore labours, so incouraging me therein. And moreouer also, for that you are able to iudge of the hope of this Worke, for the perpetuall benefit of Schooles, by the more speedie and certaine attayning both of the singular matter and latine contained in that booke of Offices, which I haue thus farre proceeded in. For the book it self I cannot but admire, according to the high commendations giuen vnto it, by the most learned: who preferre it before all others of this kind, which haue beene written by the light of nature alone; for that it doth so diuinely point out the true pathway to all vertue, and guide vnto a right course of life, as if




it had receiued direction from the sacred Scriptures themselues. So that it i

Yea, he thinketh it strange, that he should write so religiously and so like a Diuine, of helping and rele

teach, and scholars to learne; and not onely for all young men, but euen olde men themselues againe and againe both to vse and peruse. Inregard of all which, so many learned men haue not disdained to beare it in their bosome, lay it vnder their pillows, make it their companion, which way soeuer they haue gone. Now what I haue done heerein, that all who are truely studious of good learning, though children in yeares, may more easilie beholde and bee more fully partakers of these rich treasures, for which the Learned haue had this Worke in so high estimation, I referre to all who are truely learned to iudge, and chiefly to your selfe who are better acquainted with my indeuours in it. For my self, my hope is, that whereas it hath formerly seemed to sundrie so obscure, as that they haue read with very little fruit or delight, because they haue not vnderstood it; that they may now at the first viewe, liuelilie beholde the true lustre thereof,




and receiue most sweete content, to cause them euer to delight therein. Which if the Lord shall vouchsafe, as I vndoubtedly trust, I shall receiue the end of my desires, and bee incouraged to proceede to the accomplishing of the rest of it, and euer to be imployed for the common good, vntill I haue spent my last breath for the same. In which vnfained desire, I rest & euer shall

            An Admonition to the louing Reader.
            
               VNderstand, first, the matter contained in each Chapter, by reading ouer and obseruing wel the inmost columne. Then, try so farre as need is, for the true construing and resoluing therof out of the Author it selfe, both for Grammar and phrase; and also to read it into a good english stile, by the helpe of the second columne and the margents. And lastly (which is the principall) practice, out of the same (viz. the second columne and margents alone) to read daily some part of it, out of the translation into the Latine of the Author, studying it out of the English alone; trying by it, and a little help of the latine booke, where need requireth (as I haue aduised




chiefly for Corderius) how neer you can come to expresse Tully liuelily for Latine, phrase, composition, and whatsoeuer elegancy besides. After each sentence, reading the Author, to see how neer you came, marking where you failed, with the reason of it. So in a Schoole, causeeuery one in a Forme, or so many as you would haue to practice this together, thus first to construe extempore daily euery one a peece out of the Latine bookes alone, without the English; onely one of them by the English to aske and direct, where any one failes. Afterwardes, or euery other day, let euery one read his peece out of the English book alone, none hauing any Latin book, but onely some one to be in the place of the Master, to obserue, and where they faile to direct; first, by asking of him who readeth, and then of others, after helping; so posing for sense phrase, latinisme, both out of the Latin, & English, as is directed in the Grammarschoole. And then, I hope, you will in time seale with mee vpon experience, what

I haue written, concerning the benefit of such Grammaticall translations in this behalfe. For the worth of the books of Offices themselues, I referre thee to the Epistle Dedicatory. For the slips which thou shalt meete with herein, which I know to be very many (as in all the rest of my labours, chiefly through want of meete helps of bookes and conference, and also time to peruse in the midst of my continuall imployments in my Calling, vvherein I am still labouring as God vouchsafes mercy, not only for the priuate, but for thine and the publicke good, as also thorow my absence from the Presse) let me intreat thy curteous aduice and direction to the Printer, that hee may conuey it vnto me, as some louingly haue done: future Editions may reforme it. So shall I be both more incouraged, and furthered for performing my promise in finishing my intended labour, for the generall good; and the blessing thereof shall returne into thine owne bosome. And thus

                     2. For that reading his




writings hee should make his latine tong more copious.
                     3. Because howsoeuer hee yeelded vnto others the superioritie in the knowledge of Philosophy, yet hee challenged vnto himselfe a preheminence amongst Oratours; for that hee had spent his whole time therin.

                     To this purpose hee perswades him further, to the diligen reading not onely o

                     1. Because though his Orations were more lofty, hauing more power of eloquence in them; yet this middle kinde of stile, which he vseth here in his Offices is also to be regarded.
                     2. for that he obserued that none of the Gretians had attained heereunto, to excell in both these kinds of stile.

Except peraduenture Demetrius Phalerius, who was no great Oratour, though a subtile disputer, and yet of sweete speech, that he might be knowen one of Theophrastus scholars.
                     But for his owne skill in both kindes, he referreth it to the iudge ment of others.
                     Allso he thinketh that Plato could haue don excellētly, if he would haue followed that kinde of stile.
                     

                        And in like maner Demosthenes, if hee would h

                     So likewise Aristotle and Isocrates, if they had not despised one another, being either of them too much conceited in his owne studie.
                  
                  
                     5
                     Hee sheweth why he purposing to write many things vnto him, began with these books of Offices.
                     

                        1 For that this worke was most meete for them, both for the age of the one of thē, and the grauity of the other.
                     2 Because although there are many other things in philosophie very profitable, yet none so profitable as this concerning duty; nor any that extendeth it selfe

                     Sith no part of our life can bee without dutie, in what matters soeuer, or howsoeuer we are to deale in priuate or in publike.
                     

                        And moreouer for that all honesty of life is in regarding dutie, all dishonesty in the neglect of it;
                     3 Because this question of Dutie belongs to all Philosophers,
                     Neither dare any assume the name of a Philosopher, vnlesse hee haue giuen some precepts of Dutie;

Hee maketh also two kinds of Duties, of. according to the sentence. opinion of the Stoiks. The one kind. The one, which they call a perfect dutie, and is ioyned with the end of goodnesse, neither doth it agreee to or belong. appertaine to any man except or saue onely. but




only to a wise man. The other is a middle Duty or begun. The other is of a middle kinde, or onely begun, which is neither good of it selfe nor euill, but is taken or done to to some necessarie purpose. vndertaken for some vse of life: as for exāple, to restore aright. Rightly to restore that which hath beene committed to our trust to keepe, is of a perfect Duty, or a property or part of &c. is a worke of perfect Dutie: to restore, but not aright.

                     And also there is another diuision of Duty. There is moreouer another diuisiō of Dutie. For there is saide [to bee] a certaine meane. middle and a perfect Dutie. I suppose vvee may call [that] the right. perfect Dutie which the Grecians mame 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : but they call this common office 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . but this [we may call] a meane or common. middle [Dutie] which they call 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . And they define those [Duties] thus: that they define that which is right, to be a perfect Du-Dutie. But they say, that that is a middle Duty. to be a middle Dutie, which wherefore it is done, &c. for wch a probable reason




may bee rendered, wherefore it is done.
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  Before hee defines Duty, he declareth that there are two sorts of questions concerning it.
                  One sort of them about the end of good things:
                  The other, concerning precepts of Duty for framing the whole course of life.

                     Afterwards he propoundeth an other diuision of Duty, to wit, that Duty is eyther meant▪ 
                     viz. of a middle nature, or else perfect.
                  The perfect hee thinketh to be that which the Grecians call 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ; & the middle, that which they name 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
                  Then sheweth how they define both of them, viz that they define the perfect Duty to bee a right Duty.
                  The meane to bee that, for which a probable reason




may bee rend

                     Therefore there is a triple [or threefold] aduisēent [or maner of aduising] in taking counsell, as it seemeth to Panetius. THe deliberation then of taking counsell is of three sorts, as Panetius thinketh. For first [men] doe doubt, whether that which falleth into deliberation, or commeth to be considered of [or to bee weighed.] commeth to bee consulted of, bee honest to bee done or dishonest. In cōsidering wherof, their mindes are oft distracted into contrarie sentences. opinions.




                     And then or in the next place. Secondly, they search out or advise. inquire or consult, vvhether the thing whereof they take aduice, may farther [them] for the commoditie and pleasantness of life, for riches and store or abundance. ability and plentie of [all] things, for wealth and power, by which things. whereby they may both helpe themselues & their friends. theirs; all vvhich deliberation falleth into the respect. vnder the consideration of profit.
                  3 The third kind of doubting is, whenas that thing which seemeth profitable, is thought to be contrary to honestie. fight with honestie. For whenas profit doth seem to snatch to it selfe,

                  In this fifth chapter Tully teacheth first what is common to all liuing creatures by nature: as namely,
                  1. To defend them selues, liues and bodies, to shun what appeareth hurtfull, to follow after that which seemeth good for them.
                  2. An earnest desire of going together for procreatiō, with a care of their young.
                  

                     In the second place hee declareth the speciall difference betweene man and beast.
                  1. That the beast followeth only that which is present, & whereunto it is moued by sense, little perceiuing what is past or to come.
                  But man carried by reason, in considering circumstances and comparing things together, fol loweth what he taketh best for the life, and prepareth things necessarie for the leading thereof.

which they are conuersant.
                  1. As, that prudēce is a vertue, exercised in spying out the truth, & in cunning.
                  2. Iustice, is in preseruing the societie of men, and giuing euerie one their owne.
                  3. Fortitude, in the greatnesse of an in

                  4. Temperance, in keeping order and measure in all speeches and actions.
                  

                     Secondly, he sheweth how certaine seuerall duties issue out of each of these: as, out of prudence the finding out of the truth.
                  Because as euerie one best seeth the truth, and can best giue a reason thereof, so he is accounted the most prudent.
                  3. Thirdly, declareth the subiects of




these vertues; that truth is the subiect, about which prudence is chiefly exercised.
                  But certaine necessities are the subiects of the other three vertues. As for example;
                  To get and keepe these things whereby mans life may he maintained, societie & neighbourhoode preserued, the excellencie and greatnesse of his courage may bee seene, by increasing substance, getting commodities for himselfe and his, & in disposing these humane things; are the subiects about which both Iustice and Fortitude are exercised.




And fourthly that Temperance is exercised in keeping order, constancie, and moderation: whence doe chiefly proceede both honestie and comlinesse.
                  Lastly, hee noteth a difference between Prudence and the other three duties. That Prudence is only in the exercise of the minde, the other three are chiefly seene in outward actions.

And indeed. And thus haue wee spoken of the first fountaine of Dutie.
               
               
                  
                  In this chapter Tullie speaketh of Prudence: which consisteth in the knowledge of the truth.
                  1. shewing it to be the chiefe of all the foure vertues, and to concerne mankinde especially:
                  And that, because we are all drawne to a desire of knowledge, thinking it a goodly thing to excell therein, and contra
                        •…
                     ily as dishonest to be ignorant or deceiued.
                  

                     2. He teacheth, that in prudence two faults, contrary thereunto, are to be auoided.
                  1. That wee take not things which wee knowe not, as though wee knew them, and so assent rashly vnto them: and to this end, to bestowe both time & diligence to consider of matters.
                  The second is, that we bestowe not too




much studie & travell in matters both obscure & difficult, and also needlesse.
                  And these two falts beeing e
                        •…
                     chewed, that all care and diligence bestowed in searching out things honest and worthy of our knowledge, shall deserue due commendation:
                  As, Caius Sulpitius is commended for his knowledge and paines in Astrologie, Sextus Pompeius in Geometry many in Logicke and the Ciuill law, & so in other good studies.

                  And also for that the verie meditatiō of the minde is a kinde of studie; though without any great trauell.
                  Lastly, he concludeth this point with one other caution. To wit, that all our

And then that hee vse common [things] as common, and priuate [things] as his owne, peculiar for himselfe, or priuate. his owne. But no. Howbeit




no things are priuate by nature, but either by ancient possession or tenure. occupation, as [of them] who in time past came into waste grounds or places without inhabitant. empty [places:] or by victorie, a

                  In this chapter Tullie 1. setteth out the nature of

                     2. He sheweth that there are two parts of it, viz Iustice properly to called, wherein is the greatest glory of vertu

                  3. Hee declareth som speciall functions of Iustice: as, That no man hurt another but vpon iust c

                     4. Hee teacheth heereupon, how by nature all things were common, but made priuate by these meanes following, or the like: as▪ By auncient tenur
                        •…

                  Hence also he shew eth how things haue had their names of their owners, as the field Arpinas, of the Arpinatians, &c.
                  Hereupon also hee gathereth these rules;
                  1. That euerie one should content him selfe with his owne so gotten: and that whosoeuer coueteth more then his owne, violateth the




lawe of humane societie.
                  2. That for so much as we are not borne for our selues alone (as Plato writeth notably) but partly for our countrie, partly for our parents, partly for our friends▪ and ech for the good of others; like as all creatures are bred for the




good of man, so men especially for the benefit of men to profit one another; that we should heerein follow Nature as guide, in cō

                  3. In imitation of the Stoiks, who search out diligently the deriuation of words, he sheweth whence fides is named, viz. a fio & dico, because that is performed which was promised, so to shewe the nature of it.

                  5 And very many. most men are brought especially. exceedingly brought that a forgetfulnesse of Iustice should take them. to forget iustice, whenas they haue or shall fall. fall into a desire of rule, honours. honour, or of glory. For that which is in Ennius (There is no

contention is made or happeneth. commeth to passe for most part therein, that it is a very hard thing to keep a holy societie. The storme raised of late by Caius Cesar, &c. rashnesse of Caius Caesar declared that of late, who peruerted or turned topsie turuie. ouerturned the lawes of God and man. all diuine and humane lawes, for the cause of that principalitie for that soueraintie which hee had imagined to himselfe by the errour of [his] opinion. conceit.
                  And it is a grieuous thing in this kinde, that the desires of honour, rule, power, and glorie, are for the most parte in the stoutest stomacks or brauest mindes. greatest courages▪ and goodliest wits. By how much




more it is to be looked to. wee are to take heede, lest it be any thing offended in that kinde or behalfe. that wee offend not at all in that kinde.
               
               
                  
                  Tully in this chapter teacheth 1. that there are two kinds of iniustice, as there are of iustice.
                  The one is of such as doe iniurie.
                  The other of such who doe not saue others from wrong when they may.
                  

                     2. He declareth the greatnesse of these faults by comparison. For the first: That hee who assaults another vpon anger or any like passion, doth, as it were, lay violent handes on his fellowe.
                  For the second: That he that saueth not another from wrong if hee can, is aswell in fault, as if hee should forsake his parents, friends or countrie.
                  3. He noteth the vsuall causes of wrongs: as of those done rashly; anger or some sudden passion.
                  

                     Others done of set purpose, arise from feare of some euill to themselues vnlesse they hurt others. Or from couetousnesse of getting riches, or a greedie desire of pleasures.
                  Or else from ambition: as when men desire riches, eyther to be come great therby, or to pleasure others.
                  

                     As in M. Crassus: who thought no man meet to bee a prince or chief man in the commonweale, vnlesse hee were able with his reueneues to maintaine an armie▪
                  
                  Moreouer, he sheweth that wrongs are cōmitted for stately buildings, maintaining sumptuous furniture, for gorgeousnesse & plenty of all things: for which ends and the like, the desire of money is infinite.
                  

                     4. He giueth a Caueat, that the increase of a mans pri uate estate is not to be dispraised▪ but only the wronging of others by it.
                  5. He teacheth that the principall cause of iniustice is ambition, when men fall into a vehement desire of honour & glorie, and cheefly of bearing rule.
                  This hee prooueth 1. By the testimony of Ennius; That there is no holy societie nor fidelitie in seeking or ruling a kingdome.
                  2. By reason.
                  Because in things wherein moe cannot excell together, such contentions fall out, as it is hard to keep a holy societie.
                  

                     This point hee also further illustrateth by the example of Caius Cesar, who had verie lately before ouerturned all lawes both of God and men, for obtaining that rule which hee had formerly conceited.
                  Lastly, he giueth another Caueat in regard heereof, that sith these ambitious desires of rule and honour are for the most part in the greatest courages and goodliest wits, therefore all noble mindes and excellent wits should chiefely take heede heereof.

                  In this chapter
                  1. he teacheth that the nature & kinde of the wrong is to bee wisely considered: whether the iniurie was don vpon som sudden passion, or mature deliberation & aduise.
                  2. Hee giueth the reason of the necessity of this consideration,




                     viz. Because those iniuries which are done vpon any such sudden passion are lighter & to be accounted lesse, the those which are done vpon deliberation & as it were of set purpose.

                        He rehearseth the causes from whence the second kinde of iniustice may

                        arise.

For whilst they attaine the one kinde of iustice, that they hurt no man in offering iniurie. doing of wrong, they fall into the other: for beeing letted by a desire of getting learning hindred by the studie of learning, they forsake [thē] whom they ought to defend. Therefore in truth he thinketh. hee indeed thinketh, them not about to come to the commonweale, or to intermeddle in. that they would not enter into the affaires




of the common weale, but compelled or inforced, or were they not compeld. vnlesse they were compelled. But it were more reason that it should be done. more equall to be done with good will, without constraint. voluntarily. For whatsoeuer is well done. rightly done, that same is iust to▪ if it be done voluntarily. the same is thereby iust, if it be voluntarie. There be also, who either for a loue. desire of looking to their houshold affaires. sauing their substance, or by a certaine hate or some grudge. for some hatred to men, do say, themselues to do, or to follow. that they themselues to do, or to follow. looke vnto their own busines; lest they may be thought. should seeme to do wrong to any man: who whilst they are free from the one kind of iniustice, doe runne into the other. For they forsake




the fellowship. society of life, because they bestowe nothing of study, nothing of labour, nothing of substance. no studie vpon it, no labour, nor substance. Because therefore after we haue declared the two kindes of iniustice. Seeing then that two kinds of iniustice being propounded, wee haue adioyned the causes of either kinde. both kindes, and haue set downe those things before, in which iustice is cō

For it is hard to take care of other mens matters. the care of other mens matters is difficult, although that Terentian Chremes. 
                     Chremes in Terence

                  Tully declareth in this chapter.
                  1. That there may be sundrie causes of the second kinde o

                      iniustice, viz. of omitting the iust defence of our neighbour.
                  2. He setteth down




diuers of those causes: as, for auoi
                        •…

                     gence sloth or by their owne priuate studies or businesses.
                  3. He warneth that men doe not therefore think thēselues iust, and that they haue done their duties (as some philosophers do) because they are imployed in the studie of learning, or for that they contemne the world, which most




men so dote vpon, and so leaue the defence of others.
                  And thē giueth the reason hereof; Because heerby, whilst that they auoid the one kinde of i
                        •…
                     iustice, that they hurt no man, they fall into the other, viz. to forsake them whom they ought to defend.
                  And that there-vpon they cannot bee drawne to any seruice




in the cōmonweale, but by constraint; Whereas of the contrarie, hee teacheth, that all such seruice for the good of others, especially for the cō
                     monwealth, ought to be voluntary, & that then onely it is iust.
                  After, he rehearseth some other causes why men vse to leaue the defence or helping of other
                        •…
                     : as for sauing their substance▪ or vpon som hatred, grudge or the like.
                  And yet, that they to this end pretend their own businesse, orlest they should seem to doe wrong to others.
                  So that heerby they




forsake the society of life, whilst they will neither bestow any of their studie, trauell or substance for the helping of others.
                  By these things rightly considered, 
                        •…
                     e teacheth that men may bee able easily to iudge, what duty is required at euery time and season; vnlesse they be too partiall and ouer much loue them selues.
                  Yet heerin he sheweth that it is a verie ha

                     d matter, to take care of other mens businesse as wee ought: howsoeuer Chremes in Terence thinketh otherwise;

                      of those which befall others: because we behold other mens estates as it were a great way of, but our owne more neerely.
                  Lastly, for a conclusion, he commendeth that precept of such wise men, as, who forbid a man to doe any thing whereof hee doubteth, whether it bee right or wrong. Because the right is apparent of it selfe,




but the verie doubting intimateth an imagination of a wrong.

For it becommeth. it is meet [them] to be referred. that they bee referred to those foundatitions of iustice▪



                     
which I laid down in the beginning:
                  1 First that hurt be done to no man. that no man be hurt▪ 
                     next. and then that it be serued to the common profit, viz. that the cōmon commoditie be preferred. there be a respect had to the common cō
                     moditie. duty is changed when as &c. When these things are changed by the time, Dutie is changed, that remaines not. it is not alwayes the same alike.
                  
                     for some promise may fall out and couenant. For there may fall out some promise & couenant, that it may be vnprofitable to be effected. which to be performed, may bee vnprofitable either to him to whom it is promised, or else to him that. who promised it. For if (as it reported in stories. is in the Fables) Neptune had not performed. done that, which




he had promised to See the marginall note in the latine bookes. 
                     Theseus, Thes. had not beene depriued. bereft of his sonne Hippolitus. For of [his] three boones. wishes (as it is written) this was the third, which he being angry. in his fury hee asked. wished for the death. concerning the death of Hippolitus: which beeing obtayned hee fell into the greatest mourning. most grieuous lamentation.
                  Therefore neither those promises are. neither are those promises to bee fulfilled. kept, which are vnprofitable to them, to whome you haue promised. made them; nor if they hurt you more, then they profit. benefit him to whome you haue

                  Now who seeth




not not to be stoode to, or that we are not to stand to, or that it is not meet to &c. that it is not necessarie to stand to those promises, which any man. a man hath promised, beeing either constrained by feare, or deceiued by guile? most of which things. which things indeed, most of them are freed. for most parte, most of them are freed. are discharged by the Chancery or Court of conscience. Pretors Court, and many of them by Lawes, or statutelawes. statutes.
               
               
                  
                  In this chapter he teacheth, 1. That Duty may bee altered in regard of circumstances; & that wch seemeth meet for a iust and good man, may become cleane contrarie: as for example;
                  That it may sometimes bee lawfull & meete, not to restore a thing committed to vs in trust: as also, not to performe a promise made to mad men: & sometimes to deny those things, which other wise truth and faithfull dealing would require.
                  And then giueth the reason heereof.
                  Because it is meete that all such matters




be limited by tho▪ two foundations of iustice layd downe before; viz.
                  
                  1. That no man be hurt. 2. That there be a respect had to the generall good, or commonweale. And that so, duties may bee altered according to times and occasions a
                        •…
                      these fall out.
                  2. He sheweth what promises and couenants a man is not bound to keepe.
                  As first, such promises as the performance-of prooueth hurtfull eyther to him to whom they are promised, or to him that hath promised them.
                  This he illustrateth by the euill that came vpon the performance of that promise which Neptune made to




Theseus for graunting him three wishes. The last wherof was the death of his owne son Hippolitus, which in his furie he had desired: which promise being performed accordingly, hee fell into most grieuous lamentation.
                  Hence hee concludeth, that neyther such promises are to be kept; nor such as may more hurt him who promised, thē then they can benefit him to whom they are promised.




And then giueth a reason of both.
                  For that it is against Duty, to admit 
                        •…
                     ather of the greate
                        •…
                      euill then the lesse; and also giueth an instance of the later kinde.
                  As, if an aduocate should promise his client that he would pleade his cause at such a time; & in the meane while his son fals grieuously sicke that he cannot be for him; that it is not against Duty for the aduocate to be absēt in th
                        •…
                     s case: and that the client should more swarue from Duty, if hee should complaine that he was disappointed, then the other by his absēce.




So likewise hee teacheth that men are not bound to such promises as they made, inforced by feare, or drawne into by deceipt.
                  Lastly, hee sheweth that for such promi ses men are discharged of them either by the court of conscience, or some statute lawe.

                        Equity is to be looked to in law matters. 
                        In Duties belonging to the lawe, vve are not to stick in the

                  This verely is to deceiue, not to iudge. Wherefore such subtilty is to be eschewed. auoided in euery thing, or case. matter.
                  There bee also certaine Duties to




bee obserued euen towards them, of whom you haue receiued wrong.

And [indeed] I wot not. know not whether it be sufficient him who began to repent of his iniury. that hee who prouoked. began should [onely] repent of his iniury, but [that hee be] punished, that hee commit not any like thing. the like offence after, and other also may bee the slower to doe wrong.
               
               
                  
                  Tully in this chapter declareth, how iniuries ofttimes are committed by cauilling & subtile misconstruing or wresting of the lawe.
                  This he prooueth, 1. By that common prouerbe: That the extremitie of law is the extreamest ini

                  2. By vsuall experience in the cōmonwealth, whereof he giueth two notable examples of crafty dealers.
                  One of which (whose name he omitteth) hauing made truce with the enemy for thirty daies, spoiled his




land in the nights; pretending that the truce was taken only for the daies, and not for the nights.
                  The other example is of Quintus Fabius Labeo: who (as the report wēt) being appointed by the Senat of Rome, for an arbitratour betweene the Nolanes and the Neapolitanes about the setting out of the boundes of their lands, communed with both sides apart, perswading them to do nothing




couetously, & that eyther side would rather giue backe then forward, in regard of peace, and that they might not seeme to incroche vpon one another. Which when both sides had yeelded vnto, there was a peece of ground left in the midst between them: which hee adiudged from both to the people of Rome.
                  But this dealing he accounteth to bee rather▪ to deceiue then to arbitrate; & so admonisheth all to beware of it.
                  Lastly, he teacheth that there are Duties




of Iustice to be executed vpon thē who do such wrōgs and giueth the reason thereof;
                  That it is not alwaies sufficient that hee who

                        inth. I would they had not so razed Corinth: but I belieue them to haue followed the opportunity of the place especially. I take it, that they chiefly respected the situation of the place, lest the very place might at any time prouoke them to make warre. incourage them to mooue warre. Truly in my opinion. Certainly in my minde, we are alwaie to consult for peace. we ought alwaies to aduise for peace, which shall haue no deceipt. which may be free from feare of treachery. Wherein if it had been obeyed vnto me, or if I had bin obeyed. if they would haue yeelded vnto me, wee should haue had, although not the best [commonweale.] best, yet some Common vveale, which now is




none. But whereas it is to be prouided for them. you are to prouide for their safetie whome you haue ouercomne. shall subdue by force; then they who their weapons being laide away fly to the fidelitie of the Emperours. thē they especially, who yeelding vp their weapons, fly vnto the mercy of the gouernours, are to bee receiued, although

And truly. in very truth the equitie. iustice of warre is set downe. described most sincerely. holily in the law of the heralds who were to proclame warre. feciall lawe of the people of Rome. of which. Whereby it may bee vnderstoode, no war to be iust. that no warre is iust, but which either is done. mooued, things being first claymed. demands beeing first made; or which is proclaimed before, and denounced solemly or published. bidden by defiance. Pompilius 
                     the Emperour. the General [of the Romanes] kept a Prouince, in whose armie the sonne of Cato, a nouice. 
                     Catoes sonne, being a young souldier, did play the souldier. did serue. But. And whenas it seemed good to. pleased Pompilius to send away or discharge. dismisse one

But whenas hee remayned still in the army, for the loue of fighting. of the warres, Cato writ vnto Pompilius that if he should suffer. suffered him to tarry. remaine in the army, hee should binde him by a second oath of warfare. sweare him again; because the former [oath] being lost, hee might not fight by right &c. he being discharged of his former oath, might not lawfully fight with the enemies. So chiefe obseruation they had. great regarde there was in mouing or managing their warre. making warre. There is an epistle [extant] a Letter of Marcus Cato 
                     being an olde man. the elder, to Marcus his sonne; wherein he wrote himselfe to haue heard. that




hee had heard, him to haue bin dismissed. that hee was dis charged by the Consull, whenas he was a souldier. being a souldier in Macedonia in the Persian warre. Hee therfore admonisheth him to. warneth him that he take heede. beware, that he enter not into the battel. the battell: for hee denyeth that it was lawful. it to bee lawfull [for him] who is not a sworne souldier. a souldier to fight with the enemie.
                  2 And in good truth do obserue. certainly I note that. this, that hee who was a stubborne enemy by a proper name or by a proprietie of speech. who by his proper name was perduellis [id est] an open enemy. a stubborn enemie, was called hostis [meaning] a souldier or man of war. a stranger; the mildenesse of the

                     amongst. with our ancestours, whom now wee name peregrinus, [a stranger.] The twelue tables declare [the same] in these words, Aut, &c.

Also vvhen it is contended, viz. the contētion is there is fighting concerning empire, viz. about gouerning or ruling, who shall rule. for soueraigntie, and glory is sought by warre; yet it behooueth alwaies, the causes to be the same altogether which I said a little before, to be the iust causes of war. that there be the very same iust causes of warre, which I spake of a little before.

For you ought to thinke in fidelitie [or giuing your faithfull word] it is to bee considered alwaies in promises, vvhat a man haue meant [or ought to haue meant.] meant, not what hee said. But the most notable example. greatest example of iustice towardes an enemie, is constituted or appointed. vvas shewed by our ancestours. Whereas a traitor hauing run away from Pyrrhus. a runnagate traitour from Pyrrhus had promised the Senate, himselfe to giue poison to the king, [or to poison the king.] that hee would giue the king poyson and




kill him, He, or the Senate. the Senate and Caius Fabricius deliuered that runnagate traitour to Pyrrhus: so as it did not not approue by treacherie or wickednesse. the treacherous the death. death no not of an enemie, both mighty and mouing warre of his owne accord. vnprouoked. And thus it is spoken. haue we spoken sufficiently of warlike or warfaring or militarie Duties. Duties appertaining to warre.
                  Let vs also remember, that there is a iustice to bee kept euen towards the lowest men, viz. the meanest. the basest. And the condition and fortune. estate of seruants. slaues is the basest: whom they that commande to vse so, as hirelings or mercenarie. hired seruants

                  Tully heer discourseth of military duties, and teacheth; 1. That the lawes of Armes are chiefly to be obserued in a Commonweale.
                  2. That whereas there are two kinds of contention, the one in debating matters by reason, the other by force;




and that the first of these beeing proper onely to man, the other more belōging to the beastes; that we are then only to flie to the later when we cannot preuaile by the former.
                  3. Sheweth, for for what cause wars are vndertaken. viz. That men may liue in peace without iniurie.
                  4. What is to bee done when the victory is gotten, viz. That they bee preserued who haue not carried themselues cruelly in the fight.
                  This he illustrateth by the example of their ancestors, who receiued some such euen into the citie, as the Tusculanes, Equies, &c. when as they vtterly rased




and spoiled other cities, as Carthage and Numance. And so likewise Corint; though he thinketh that this was done onely in regard of the situation of it; lest the place might haue incouraged them to new warre. Here he giueth this generall aduice;
                  That men should alwaies consult for peace, so 
                        〈◊〉
                      as it may bee free from dāger of treachery. This he teacheth by the effects, that if they had done this as hee would, they had had a florishing cōmonweale, which now was none in respect.
                  

                     5. That as the conquerors are to prouide for the safetie of all whom they shall subdue, except such who haue carried themselues cruelly; so more specially for them who yeelding vp their weapons haue betaken them selues to the mercy of the gouernour, though there hath been no remedy but to yeelde or die.
                  This he commendeth by the example and custome of their auncestors, that made such cō

                     6. Hee declareth that the iustice of war, is most holily lette downe in the lawe of the heralds of the Romanes; & that therein it may be seene what warre is iust, viz. No war but which is moued vpon demands first made, or proclamed solēaly, or b

                     dden by open defiance.
                  7 He setteth down certaine other special Duties to be obserued in warre. 1. That no souldier be admitted to fight with the enenue, but being first solemnly sworn. This he sheweth by the authoritie of Cato, writing to Pompilius the Generall, vnder whom his sonne was a young souldier:




That, whereas hee had heard, that hee had dismissed his sonne, vpon the occasion of dismissing that band 
                        〈◊〉
                      hee was; hee should not suffer him to remaine in the armie much less to fight, vnlesse hee sware him againe; Because hee beeing discharged of his former oth might not lawfully fight, vnlesse hee was sworne againe.
                  Also by another Letter of his, to his sonne; That whereas




he heard that he being then a souldier in the Persian wa
                        •…
                      was discharged by the Consull, hee should not enter the battel to fight: because it was not lawfull for him who was not a souldier, to fight with the enemie; signifying that none indeede were souldiers but those which stoode sworne.
                  A second is, that there bee as much mildenesse shewed to the enemy as may be.
                  This he proueth by the example of their auncestours; who gaue to the enemie the fairest name they could: as by calling him who was properly perdu
                        
                           •…
                        llis, viz. a stubborn enemy, hostis, meaning,




a stranger or forener, according to the auncient custome; so mitigating the hainousnes of the thing by the mildenesse of the word.
                  This hee proueth moreouer by the lawes of the twelue tables wherein the obstinate enemy is vsually called hostis, intimating a stranger.
                  Although he sheweth that through processe of time the word hostis is vsed properly for the open enemie, who proudly beateth armes against vs.
                  

                     A third Dutie is, That when the war is onely for souerantie and glory; as there must bee the same iust causes of war, mentioned before: so that warre must be made with as little cruelty as may be.
                  This he illustrateth 1. by an argument from the like, taken from the manner of




our contention in ciuill matters. That is in ciuill strife wee deale one way with an enemie, with whom we contend for life & honestie; and another way with a competitour who contendeth with vs onely for honour & dignity: so must it be in warlike matters.
                  After, hee further manifesteth it by particular exāples: As by the warre against the Celtibers & Cimbrians, which was as against enemies for life: and contrarily against the Latines, Sabines Samnites, Carthagineans & Pyrrhus for the empire only wherein they dealt fairer, though some of these enemies were truce breakers and too cruell.
                  

                     Thirdly, he sheweth it by a noble saying of Pyrrhus, about the restoring of pr
                        •…

                     So that hee who should win it by the sword should weare it, with as harty good will as the great Gods gaue it. This he commendeth for a princely saying, and well beseeming one descē
                     ding from Achilles. A fourth precept is, That the verie priuate souldiers performe their word to the enemy, though they promised, being inforced thereunto, by the occasion of the times and straights whereunto they were driuen. This ho
                        •…
                      declareth also by examples; first of Regulus a worthy Roman:




who in the first Punike war, being taken prisoner by the Carthagineans, and by them sent to Rome about the ex changing prisoners, hauing sworne that he would returne vnlesse he obtained the exchange of them; hee both disswaded the matter [as incōmodious] and chused rather to returne to the enemy, to endure any punishment (thogh he was much staied by his friends) then to breake his promise giuen to them.
                  

                     The second example is of the Censors of Rome: who fined all those tenne at an yearely fine, during their liues, who had falsified their othes, whereby they had bound themselues to Anniball the enemy that they would returne to him, vnlesse they obtained the ransoming of certaine prisoners at Rome. And so dealt they likewise with one other, who deluded the oth which hee had taken, by a kinde of equiuocating, so imagining himselfe free. For he hauing sworne to returne; so soone as euer hee was gotten without the campe, he returned presently, as if hee had forgot




something: & then getting himself out of the campe again, he thought himself quit from his oth; as hee seemed in words, though indeed hee was not.
                  Which Tully prooueth by a generall rule for all promises;
                  That the true meaning, not the bare words, is euer to be respected therein. A fift precept is this, That there be euer kept a speciall hatred of treachery. This hee teacheth by a notable example of iustice euen towards the enemy and against such dealing: That when as a runnagate from Pyrrhus had promised the Senate to poison him; the




Senate sent the traitor back to Pyrrhus signifying his treacherie: Thereby shewing their hatred of such a fact, though against an enemie both mightie, and mouing war vnprouoked.
                  Thus farre he hath spoken of warlike Duties.
                  Next, he speaketh of Iustice to bee kept, euen towards the basest sort and condition of people, which he maketh to bee the slaues; that we are as wel bound to giue them their due for their labor, as to require their labor of them.
                  

                     Lastly, hee setteth downe two maners of doing iniurie: One by force, wch is most proper to the lion; A second by fraude, the propertie of the foxe: both of them be vnbefitting man; but guile the worse of the two.
                  And here he teacheth what is the most hainous kind of all iniustice, viz. when men intende the most deceipt, yet do it vnder a pretence of honesty, and to the ende that they may seeme good men.

                        teacheth three things to be looked vnto chiefly. sheweth that three things [are] to be looked to especially. The first [is] that wee giue not any thing which may bee hurtfull to the receiuer; nor that wee take from others. some by wrong




that which we would giue. may giue to others. The second [is] that wee vse. exercise our liberality for the measure of our substance. according to our ability. The third [is] that wee giue not to whom wee ought not. But we must giue either to [men] being commendable or praise worthie. to them who are commended for vertue, or to them who prosecute vs in honest good will, are louingly affected towards vs; or with whom some band of societie doth come betweene to vs or pas

repeating the degrees of humane societie from the chiefe fountaine or spring. first originall, he cōpareth them amongst thēselues, that so much may bee performed how much. as is due to euery one. But Seneca hath written most carefully. diligently in many bookes concerning this part.
                  
                  
                     Let it be spoken furthermore, as it was purposed, of bountie and liberalitie.

For both they that doe a pleasure to any one which may hurt him, whom they would seeme to will or desire pleasure. willing to profit, are not to be iudged. deemed

                      And indeede there are many and [those] indeede. and namely [those who] are desirous of honor and glory, who forceablely take. catch away from some, that which they giue vainely. lauish to others. These also suppose that they shall seeme bountifull towardes their owne. their friends, if they inrich them by any way. any meanes.




But that is so farre off from Dutie, that nothing can be more contrarie to Dutie. We must therfore take heed, that we vse we must see therefore that. such liberality, as may profit our friends, and hurt no body. no man. Wherefore of L. Syll

For nothing is liberall which same. which is not iust. the other place of caution was, or the second caution.

                  In this chapter Tully discourseth of bounty or liberalitie;
                  1. Giuing it this commēdation, that nothing is more be seeming man.
                  2. He teacheth that three things are to be looked vnto in it: as,
                  1. That our bountie




neither hurt thē to whom we would seeme bountifull, nor others.
                  2. That our bountie bee not aboue our abilitie.
                  The third is, That wee giue to euerie one according to their dignitie: for this he counteth the chiefe foundation of iustice, whereunto all these are to be referred.
                  Cōcerning the first of these three; he teacheth vs to beware of it: first, because they, who pleasure others with that which may hurt them, are not to bee deemed




bountifull, but pernicious flatterers.
                  And secondly, because they who hurt some to be bountifull therewith to others, run into the same fault, as if they should take from others to i
                        •…
                     rich themselues therby,
                  Now hee sheweth that there are many of this later so
                        •…
                     t; as namely all desirous of glorie: who suppose that they shall seeme bountifull to their friendes, if they may inrich them by any means




But this he teacheth to be so farre from Duty, as that nothing can bee more contrary vnto it.
                  Whence hee giueth this generall direction for our liberalitie to our friends, That it bee such as may do them good without the hurt of any man.
                  And so concludeth, that the conueying of goods by Sylla and Cesar from the iust owners to others, ought not to be thought liberality; because nothing is liberall which is not iust.
                  Concerning the second caution, viz. That our bountie bee not aboue our abilitie, hee giueth these reasons of it:




1. Because such as will giue beyonde their abilitie, are iniurious to their next of kin: for that they conuey those riches to strangers, which it were more reason, should bee dealt & left to their kinsfolkes.
                  2. Because there is commonly in such liberalitie a greedie desire of pulling from some iniuriously, that they may haue to lauish to others:
                  3. Because this kind of liberalitie springeth rather frō vaine




glorie then good nature, onely to the ende that they may seeme bountifull; and so rather from ostentation, then a free heart.
                  So that he accounteth 
                        •…
                     uch a counterfeit shew, neerer to vanitie, then either to liberalitie or honestie.
                  For the third cautiō 
                     viz. That we giue to euery one according to their dignity; hee directeth, that heerin we haue a speciall regard of the worthinesse of each towards whō we vse our bountie; and therein to consider both his manners and affection towards vs, as also his neighborhood, society, friendship, & kindnes
                        •…
                     es to vs.
                  

                     All which he teacheth, that it were to be wished they might concurr; otherwise the moe of them and greater to haue the more weight and respect with vs in our liberalitie.

                        maners to be looked vnto. 
                        Manners are to bee considered, not according to the exact

And euerie one to be so honoured especially. Also that euery man be specially so regarded, as each shall bee chiefely adorned more specially graced with these milder vertues, [viz.] moderation. modestie, temperance, and that same iuslice
                        q wee haue spoken much before. of which *many




things are spoken alreadie. For a valiant minde and great. a hauty & a great spirit. courage is for the most parte more feruent, in a man not perfect nor wise. who is too short in perfection and wisedome: [but] these 
                        viz. modestie, temperance and iustice. vertues seeme rather to touch. appertaine to a good man. And these things [may be considered] in manners.
               
               
                  
                  Tully declareth in this chapter, what is to be considered concerning mens maners spoken of before, for the guiding of our liberalitie.
                  And first, that wee neglect no man, in whom there appeareth any shewe of vertue.
                  Hereof also hee giueth this reason; Because we liue not with men who are perfect & absolutely wise; but with such as in whome, wee thinke it very well, if there be but resemblances of vertue.
                  2. That we regarde euery one the more as he shall be more graced with the milde vertues of modesty, temperance and Iustice: and then giueth the reason hereof;
                  

                     Because hauty courages and hotte spirits are not vsually in the wisest men; but contrarily those milder vertues, viz. of Temperance & Iustice, seem commonly to follow a good man.

                        how we are to consider. 
                        How the good will of others towards vs, is to bee 
                        esteemed. 
                        considered.
                     
                  
                  

                     
                     And. NOw concerning the good wil wch euery one beareth. hath towards vs; that is the chief point in Dutie, that we giue most to him, of whome wee are beloued most. But let vs iudge wee must measure good will, not after the guise or fashion. manner of young men, by a certaine feruency. heate of loue; but rather by assurednesse and steadfastnesse. stabilitie and constancie.
               
               
                  
                  Heere Tully teacheth how we are to consider of mens affections towards vs.
                  And first, that this is to bee looked vnto principallie; that wee giue most to him of whom wee are most beloued. 2. That we measure mens affections towards vs, not by a certaine heate of loue for a fit, as yong men are wont to doe; but by the stability & constancie thereof.

                        How kindnesse is to bee requited to them who haue

imitate the fruitfull. fertile fields; which bring much more then they haue receiued? For if vvee doubt not. stick not to bestowe kindnesses vpon them, whom wee hope will profit vs. do vs good hereafter; what ones. what manner of men ought wee to be towards them, who haue done vs good alreadie?
                  For whereas there bee two kindes of liberality, one of giuing. bestowing a benefit, the other of requiting, whether we will giue or no is in our owne power, choice it is in our owne power vvhether wee vvill giue or no: [but] not to restore is not lawfull for a good man. it is not lawefull for a good man not to restore,




if so that he can do it without iniurie. There are also choises. respects to be had of benefits receiued: neyther [is there any] doubt, but most is due to each greatest, or who hath done vs the greatest kindenesse. to euerie the greatest. Wherein yet it is especially to bee considered. weighed, with what minde, affection, and good will euery one. any man doth it. hath done it. For many men doe many things of or through. in a certaine rashnesse. headinesse, without iudgement, reason discretion or measure, towards all [alike:] or else being stirred vp by force of minde. carried with violence of affection, as with a certaine rushing. sudden winde: which kindenesses. benefits




are not to be accounted so great, as those which are deferred or giuen offered with iudgement, considerately. adui sedly and constantly. But in gratifying any. bestowing of a benefit, and in requiting kindnesse, (if [all] other things bee alike. correspondent) this is chiefly of Duty. this is a principall point of Duty; that as euerie one. any one stādeth especially. most in neede of [our] aide. helpe, so to helpe him especially. Which is done by the most. of verie many contrariwise. clean contrary.
                  For from whome. of whom they hope for most, although he haue no neede of these things of them, yet they




                     respect him. serue him chiefly. especially.
               
               
                  
                  Tullie in this chapter giueth directions for requiting of me
                        •…
                     s kindnesses to vs; & first teacheth that wee ought to haue a speciall care heereof. Because there is no Duty more necessarie then it.
                  2. That wee ought to repay such kindnesses with a greater measure then we receiued them.
                  This hee prooueth first, by the testimonie of Hesiode, commanding to restore things borrowed for our vse, with fuller measure, if we can; and therfore much more such good turnes, as haue been done vs frankly, and whereby we haue bin prouoked; heerein imitating




the fertile fieldes.
                  Secondly, he sheweth it by another reason from the less thu
                        •…
                     ; That if wee sticke not to bestowe benefits on them who (wee hope) will doe vs good heereafter, much more ought we on them, who haue done vs good alreadie.
                  3. Whereas there are two kindes of liberalitie, one of bestowing a benefit, the other of requiting; hee teacheth, that howsoeuer it is in a mans owne power whether hee will freely giue a benefit or no; that yet it is not in any case lawfull for a good man, not to




requite a kindnesse, if he can do it without iniurie to any.
                  3. For kindenesses receiued, that wee haue special regard: because howsoeuer wee owe most to him of whom wee haue receiued most; yet wee are to weigh with what mind & affectiō any one hath benefited vs. Because many men do such things vpon a certain headinesse without discretion, & towardes all alike, or carried with some violence of affection: which benefits he teacheth




not to bee so great, as those which are bestowed with iudgement, aduice and constancy.
                  Lastly, that in all these, this is a principal part of Duty; that (all other things beeing answerable) we helpe him most that stāds in most neede: though men commonly deale cleane contrarily; giuing to them most, of whom they looke for most, although they haue no need.

But because the of euerie one by himselfe. substance riches. of each priuate man is small, and the multitude of them who neede these riches. it is infinite, common liberalitie must be referred to that end which Ennius speaketh of. of Ennius, that neuerthelesse it may shine to him selfe. light himselfe; That we may haue ability, wherewith we may be liberall to our owne.
               
               
                  
                  Here Tully setteth downe certaine things concerning the neighborhood and society of men, and how it may bee best maintained.
                  And first giueth this generall precept; that as euerie one is neerest vnto vs, so wee bestowe most on him.
                  

                     Secondly, noteth the degrees of neighborhood and societie in nature.
                  And therin the first is, that which is seen in the generall societie of all mankinde: the bonde whereof he sheweth to bee reason and speech.
                  Because these ioyne men together in a certaine naturall societie, by teaching, learning, conferring, reasoning, iudgeing and the like: and also because these make men to differ most from the nature of beasts: wch though they may haue hardi




nesse as in Lions, horses, &c. and other such like qualities: yet can they not haue iustice or goodnesse, because they want reason & speech.
                  Thirdly, he sheweth that this societie extendeth it self most largely to all men amōgst themselues; & that to this end, a community of all things which nature hath made to the cō mon vse, be kept according as they are appointed by Statutes and the Ciuill lawe;
                  

                     And for all other things, that they be so obserued, as it is in the Greeke proverbe; That all things be common among friends.
                  Fourthly, he noteth more particularly, what Duties ought to bee common to be performed to al, besides those appointed by lawes; viz. what good soeuer we may doe to others, without hurt to our selues: and that wee are to performe the same euen to them whom wee knowe not; according to the saying of Ennius: as,
                  To shew the way curteously to one going out of his way. To light another mans light frō ours. So, not to for-
                  

                     So, not to forbid any the running water. To suffer any one to take fire from our fire. To giue faithfull counto each asking ou

                      aduice.
                  And generally to yeelde whatsoeuer things are profitable to the receiuer, not hurtfull to the giuer.
                  

                     Whence he concludeth that as we are to vse these things our selues; so euer to haue respect to the common good of all:
                  Yet here he giueth another caution. That because the substance of each priuate man is small, and the multitude of them that stand in need is infinite; that euery one so order his liberality that first he looke to himselfe and his, and so to all other in their place, and as they are neerer to him or further off in degree.
               
            
            
               
                  
                  Chap. 21.
                  THere bee also moe degrees of society of men. for to leaue that endlesse number. For that we may departe from that infinitenesse, there is a neerer [degree]; To bee of the same countrie or people. stocke, nation, [and] tongue. language, by which. whereby men are chiefly. especially knit together.
                  It is also more inward. neere, to bee of one. the same Citie. for there are many things common to citizens among themselues. For citizens haue many things common amongst themselues; the place where the court is kept or the market. Common Hall, temples. Churches, porches or galleries. Gallerie walks, waies. High waies, Lawes, rights. Priuiledges,




Iudgements, Voices in election, Customs besides. likewise and Familiarities, also many matters and reasons [couenants or dealings] contracted. Bargaines with many. But sundry. a faster k

For from that infinite or innumerable. vnmeasurable society of mankinde, it is shut vp into verie little and streight [place.] it is driuen into a little and a narrowe compasse. For sith. whereas this is common of all liuing creatures. to all liuing creatures by nature, that they haue a lust of procreation, breeding or ingendring. a desire of procreation; the first societie is in wedlocke it selfe. in the very wedlock, the next in children

                     and then. and after that one house, to which. whereto all things are common. And that. this is the beginning. originall of a Citie, & as it were the seminarie. seedplot of a Cōmonweale.

                  And so the felowship or matching of bloods. coniunction of blood & good will [thereupon] bindeth. knitteth men in loue together. For it is a great matter to haue the same monuments of our ancestours, to vse the same holy rites. religion, to haue sepulchers, or places of buriall common. the same burying places. But of all societies there is none more excellent. better, none more sure or stable. firme, then when good men like in maners. conditions, are conioyned. linked together in familiaritie. For that honestie, (which wee haue oft times




                     spoken of. mentioned) although wee see it in another, yet it allureth vs. moueth vs; and maketh vs to be friendly. friends to him, in whom it seemeth to be in, or to dwell. be. And although euery vertue, or all kinde of vertues. all vertue allureth vs to her. it selfe, and maketh that we loue them. causeth vs to loue them in whome it seemeth to be; yet Iustice and Liberalityq effecteth it. 
                     to be in, viz. dwell or harbour. worketh thatq especially. most of all. And indeed. But, there is nothing more amiable. that winneth more loue, nor more coupling together. that linketh men more surely together, then similitude of good maners. a likenesse of good conditions. For in whome there are like studies. the same desires, the same wills. mindes,




                     it is done in these. it commeth to passe amongst these, that each is delighted equally with, &c. that either is as much delighted with the other as with himselfe: and that is effected or commeth to passe. is brought to passe, which Pythagoras 
                     willeth. requires in friend ship, that one be made of many. many become one. Also that communitie of fellowship, or societies common fellowship is great, which is made of. groweth of benefits or good turnes. kindnesses giuen and taken. receiued to and fro. which kindnesses. Which whilst they are common from one to another, and such as pleasure one another. mutuall and pleasuring, they amongst whome those [kindnesses] are. those happen, are tied in fast fellowship. linked in a firme societie.
                  But when you haue viewed or perused. considered




all things, in reason and minde discourse and reason; there is none of all societies. of all societies there is none more acceptable, none more deare, then that which is to euery one of vs. which euery one of vs hath with the Cōmon-weale.

                  Chap. 21.
                  In this chapter hee setteth downe sundrie degrees of the societie of men. And first, how after the generall society with all, these are neerer degrees; 1. To bee of the same stocke, nation & language, whereby men are more specially knit together.
                  2. To bee of the same citie, is a neerer degree. These also haue many things common among themselues, as common-hals, churches, walkes, high-waies, lawes priuiledges, iudgements,




voyces in election, customes, dealings, and the like, to ioyne them together.
                  3. A neerer degree is of kinsfolkes, to be of the same kin, wherein the society of men is brought into a narrow compasse.
                  And heere hee teacheth, what is the▪ verie first and

third in one house wherto most things are common.
                  This he sheweth to be the originall of a citie, & as it were the seede plot of a common weale. A fourth societie he noteth to be of cozin germanes, viz. of brethren and sisters children: wch when they so increase that they can not be contained in one house, doe get them abroade into other houses as into colonyes, or newe townes.
                  After do follow entermariages:
                  Whence ariseth a fift societie; viz. of alliances of kinsfolkes by mariage, of which many kin do spring.
                  

                     And this propagation hee noteth to be the original of common-weales. Also, that this coniunction of blood and good will knitteth men in loue together;
                  And that so much the more, because they haue the same monumēts of their ancestours, religion, burying places, &c. which hee noteth to bee a great matter to knit the harts of men in one.
                  5 But of all other societies he teaches that the excellentest and most firme, is of friends; viz. whē good men like in conditions, are linked together in familiarity.
                  

                     The reason hereof is, first, because the vertues which wee see or imagine in others, do most firmly binde vs vnto them, & especially Iustice & liberalitie.
                  And secondly, for the likeness of conditions in right friends; then wc• he sheweth that nothing winneth more true loue, nor linketh men more firmely: for that in whom there are the same desires & mindes, either of




them is as much delighted with the other as with himselfe; & thence a
                        •…
                     iseth that which Pithagoras requires in friendship; That many become one.
                  Furthermore, hee teacheth here, that the fellowship wch groweth of kindenesses giuen and taken to and fro, is verie great; because these being mutuall and pleasuring one another, must needs link men in a firme league.
                  Sixtly, he teacheth, that yet all things




being rightly considered, the most acceptable & deare societie of all others, is that which which euerie one hath with the common wealth.
                  This hee prooueth by an argument from the lesse, thus; That howsoeuer our parents are dear vnto vs, and so our kinsfolkes & familiars, yet our countrie alone contains in it selfe the loues of all these, and therefore ought to be dearer to vs then all these. So that no good man should doubt to lay down his life for it, if hee may doe it good.
                  Whence hee noteth that the beastly crueltie of such men who seeke the vtter




ouerthrowe of their countries, or the rending the same in peeces by any mischiefe, ought to be abhorred of all. Lastly, he declareth, that if yet comparison and question be made, to which of these societies most duty ought to bee yeelded; That,
                  1. Our countrie & parents are to bee preferred, because wee are specially bounde with their benefits.
                  2. That our children and whole familie are next, because they depende vpon vs alone.

                  And to these principally he teacheth, that the necessarie aydes of life appertaine; but that familiar conuersation, counsels, speaches, exhortations, consolations and otherwhile chidings, are most vsuall amongst friends.
                  And in a word, that of all friendships that is the pleasantest which is linked by likenesse of conditions.

                     The Argument.
                     
                        It behooueth the Duties of liberalitie to be looked vnto not onely, &c. 
                        The Duties of Liberality ought to be cōsidered, not only 
                        from. 
                        by these degrees of societie, but also by other circumstances.
                     
                  
                  1 BVt in distributing or performing al these doing all these Duties, it is to be seen. we must mark what is most needfull. necessarie for euerie man, and what euery one can attaine or cannot. is either able or vnable to attaine with vs or without vs. Therefore the degrees of friendship must not be alike to the degrees of times. shall not bee the




same, which [are] of times.
                  2 Al There are
                        Al. And there are Duties. certaine Duties which are due rather. more due to some then to others: as, you shall sooner helpe your neighbour in getting. inning [his] corn, then either your brother, or your familiar friend.
                  But if there bee a controuersie in iudgement. trauerse in law, you shall rather defend your kinsman and friende then your neighbour.
                  These things therefore, and the like are to be warily looked vnto. thorowly considered in euery Dutie; also custome and exercise. practice is to be taken. are to




be vsed, that vvee may bee able to giue vp a good account. good reckners. makers of account of Duties: to see by adding and deducting what may be the summe of the rest or remainder. what summe remayneth of the rest. Whereupon you may vnderstand, viz. a man may vnderstand. wee may vnderstand how much is due to euery one. But, as neither Physiciās, nor Captaines▪ nor Oratours, although they haue perceiued [or attained] the precepts gotten the rules of [their[art, can attaine to any thing worthy great praise. commendation, without vse and exercise. practice: so indeede those rules of obseruing. keeping Duty are set downe or deliuered. taught vs, that wee our selues




                     may doe them should put them in vre. But. For the greatnesse or difficulty. hardnesse of the matter requireth also vse and exercise. And we haue said almost enough. And thus haue we spoken almost sufficiently, how honestie from which [all] Dutie ariseth or cometh springeth, is drawn or fetched. deriued from those things, which are in the law of right of mans fellowship. humane societie.
               
               
                  
                  Tully in this chapter setteth downe some other Duties, concerning our bounty and liberality: as,
                  1. that in performing Duties to ech societie mentioned, we must still consider, what is most necessarie for euery man; and then what each is able to attaine of himselfe, & what hee cannot without our helpe: and that the degrees of friendship and of times are not alwaies alike.
                  

                     2. That there are certain Duties more due to some further from vs in degree then others neerer. As, that we are sooner to helpe out neighbour in inning his corne then our brother, or familiar friend; but in a trauerse of law a man is rather to defend his kinsman or friende then his neighbour.
                  3. That as wee are throughly to consider these things in euerie Duty, so also to put them in vre: that by long custome and practice




we may become expert to knowe what is due to euery man.
                  This hee maketh plaine by a similitude taken from Physiciās, Captains and Oratours; who although they haue gotten the rules of their art, yet cannot attaine ought worthy any great commendation, without vse and practice.
                  And also that al the rules of Duty are taught vs that wee




may practice them; and for that the hardnesse of the matter requireth vse and exercise.
                  And thus concludeth this point, how honestie is deriued from those things which are in the lawe of humane societie.

Also Magnanimity is practised. exercised partly in martiall business or matters of warre or chiualrie. warlike matters, but more in

                        Tully 
                        disputeth. discourseth diuersly.
                  
                  BVt wee must vnderstand, whereas four kinds [of virtue] are propounded, from wch Honestie and Dutie should slee. pro ceed; that to seem most bright, or most glorious. that seemes to shine most brightly, which is done. wrought with a great and haughty courage. loftie spirit, despising humane things. worldly vanities. Therefore [that] is especially in readinesse. commonly ready in reproachfull speeches. reproach, if any such thing may be said.
                  For in truth yee

                  And contrarily in praises, I wot. know not how, we praise those things, as with a more full mouth, which are done with a noble. great courage, both. valiantly and excellently. Hence is the [large] discourse. field of the Rhetoriciās, concerning Maratho, Salamis, the Plateans, Thermopilanes, Luctrians,

                  Heere Tully entereth to speak of fortitude, shewing it self in a braue mind, despising these externall things; teaching that it seemeth the most glorious of all the foure cardinall vertues.
                  This hee prooueth first by the vsuall reproches & taunts which are cast vpon men for their lacke of courage:
                  As the speech of




the Generall in Ennius taunting the cowardlinesse of the souldiers;
                  That they bare but womanish hearts, and that a maide by her valour put them all to shame.
                  And againe: That the Salmatian spoiles were without sweat or blood. Secondly, by the contrary praises, & the exceeding commendations of such exploits as are done valorously and with a noble spirit.
                  This hee further illustrateth,
                  1. By the ample praises of the Rhetoricians both of his owne and former times, concerning sundry valorous persons, their




noble acts, and places where; especially of the people of Rome, whose chiefe fame was for their valour.
                  And lastly, for that whome the people of Rome would chiefly honor, they erected them pictures in honour of them, for most part in warlike attire.

                        Fortitude if it departe from honestie, 
                        to lose. 
                        loseth 
                        the name of fortitude. 
                        the name.
                     
                  
                  1 BVt that loftinesse of mind or courage. spirit which is seene in perils and in labours. trauells, if it want of iustice. be void of iustice and fight not for the common good. safetie, but for the owne commodities [or a mans priuate gain] priuate commoditie, is in fault [or is to bereckoned faulty] is faultie. For that is not onely not the propertie of vertue. no propertie of vertue, but rather of fiercenesse. brutishnesse, repelling all humanitie. setting all humanitie aparte.
                  2 Therfore valour therefore. fortitude is well defined




of the Stoiks, vvhen they say, it to be a vertue. that it is a vertue contending. fighting for in defence of equitie. equity. Wherfore no man that hath attained the glory of fortitude, [euer] got [that] praise, by wilie traines and naughtie dealing. treacherie, & naughtie deceit: for nothing can be honest vvhich is voide of iustice. That therefore of Plato is worthy. Therefore that is a worthie saying of Plato: Not only (quoth he) [that] knowledge which is remoued. seuered from iustice is rather to be called craftinesse. subtilty then wisedome; but also a courage which is prepared. forward to danger, if it be inforced or thrust forward. set on by the own couetousnesse or desire of gaine. for ones

And therefore we would haue valiant and noble minded men. men who are valorous and puissant, to bee good and simple. plaine hearted, friends. louers of truth, and nothing at all deceitfull; which are of the middle praise of Iustice of the midst of all the praises of iustice.
                  3 But that is odious, that in this such hautinesse and greatnesse of courage, there groweth very soone. most easily obstinacie. a wilfulnesse, and and ouer-great desire of bearing




rule. For as it is in Plato. as Plato writeth, that the generall fashion of the Lacedemonians, was to be inflamed with a desire of conquering: euen so euery one as hee doth most excell in greatnesse of courage, so hee specially desireth to bee prince. chiefe of all, or rather to be alone. without p

                     ere. And when you shall earnestly desire. a man coueteth to excell all. to bee aboue all, it is a difficult thing to keep equitie, which belongeth properly. is most proper to iustice. Wherupon it commeth to passe, that they cannot abide that they should be ouercomn or bridled. endure themselues to be ouercomn, neither




by reasoning, nor by any publike & lawfull right. by any common and right order of lawe. And they become for the most part giuers of great gifts. bribers & makers of factions. factious, that they may attaine the greatest wealth, and be rather superiours by power, then equall by iustice. but by how much that is more difficult, by so much [it is] more famous. But the harder it is [to master this affection] the worthier it is▪ For there is no season. time that ought to want. to be without iustice. They therefore are to be accounted valorous & of a worthie courage, not who doe, but who driue away iniurie. not who doe wrong, but withstand it. But a true and wise




valour of minde iudgeth that honesty which▪ nature chiefly followeth, to be put. to consist in deeds and not in glory; himselfe to be chiefe. and had rather himselfe to be chiefe. bee the chiefe, then to seeme so. For whoso. hee that dependeth vpon the errour. erronious conceit of the vnskilfull multitude. rude multitude, he is not. is not to be accounted in great men. in the number of valiant men. But as euery man is of courage most high and desirous of glorie, [so] is hee most easily inforced or eged on. driuē on to vniust doings. matters. which is indeed a very slippery place Which place is indeed slipperie, because there is scarce any man




found, who, labours being vndertaken and perils gone into or a

                        chiued. when he hath sustained trauells, and aduentured dangers, doth not desire glorie as a reward of his labours.
               
               
                  
                  Tullie in this chapter teacheth, how to discerne of true fortitude.
                  And first, that bould nesse in daungers, if it be either voide of iustice, or fight for a mans priuate cō
                     moditie and not for the common good, is not true fortitude: because it is no propertie of vertue, but rather of brutishnesse, setting aside all humanitie.
                  Secondly, he commendeth that definition




of fortitude, giuē by the Stoiks; That it is a vertue fighting for equity.
                  And thereupon inferreth first, that no man euer attained the praise of true fortitude by treacherie or naughtie dealing: for that nothing can be honest which is not iust.
                  Secondly, commendeth a worthy saying of Platoes to this end;
                  That as knowledg seuered from iustice is rather called subtletie then wisdom; so a courage, thogh forward to perils,




yet if it be set on for greedinesse of gain or other priuate respects, and not for the cōmon good, ought rather to be tearmed audaciousnesse then valour.
                  And thirdly thereon exhorteth all who would be truely valorous, to be good men and of plaine hearts, louers of truth, and free from all deceipt; because these vertues rightly deserue the praise of iustice.
                  In the third place, he reprooues another odious fault which attends vpon too great hautinesse of minde: that commonly such men become headie, and are ouer-desirous of ruling.
                  

                     This hee prooueth by the testimonie of Plato, shewing this to be the generall fashion of the Lacedemonians, to be inflamed with a desire of conquering: and that hēce; because as any one more excelleth in courage, so he more desireth to be chief of all and without peere.
                  And then declareth other mischiefs following in them heereupon: as first, iniustice; because it is hard for such to keepe equitie.
                  2. Pride, so as they cannot indure to yeelde to others either




in reasoning or any right triall of lawe.
                  3 Bribing or corrupting others by gifts and making factions, whereby they may attain the greatest wealth and become rather superiours by wealth, then equall by iustice.
                  But yet he teacheth that the harder it is for such valorous mindes to bee iust, the more excellent it is in them who attaine it.
                  Lastly, he concludeth heerupon that they onely are to be accounted valorous, not who do wrong to any; but they who saue others from wrong.
                  And that true valour




iudgeth that excellencie, which nature aimeth at chiefely, to consist in deeds and not in glory.
                  Also that all who are truly valorous had rather bee the chiefe indeed then to seem so. Because hee who dependeth on the erronious cō ceipt of the rude multitude, is not to be reckoned in the number of val
                        •…
                     ant men.
                  And besides, because the brauest mindes and most desirous of glorie are the easiliest ouer carried to vniust actions.
                  And finally, that therefore valorous mindes do stand in a very tickle & slippery place: because




it is hard to finde a man, who hauiug atchiued great exploits & dangerous aduentures, desireth not glory as a reward of his labors.

                        prosperitie and aduersitie, and in

                        atchiuing hard enterprizes.
                     
                  
                  A Valorous and great minde is altogether. alwaies discerned in two things especially: whereof the one consisteth




in the contempt. despising of outward things: when it is perswaded to a man. one is perswaded▪ 
                     a man to owe to admire, wish or to desire earnestly nothing but that, &c. that a man ought not either to admire, or to wish, or earnestly to desire any thinge, but what is honest and comely; and to yeeld to none, neither man. neither to yeelde to no. any either man, or passion or affection. perturbation of mind, nor to fortune.
                  The other thing is, that when you are so affected▪
                      disposed in minde, as I said before, you doe. vndertake great matters. enterprizes, and those indeed most profitable, but vehemently. very hard, and full of trauell and danger both of life, and

For that is [or consists] therein. therin is that which maketh excellent courages, and despising worldly vanities. and such as despise all humane things. And this same thing. same is seene. appeareth in two things; if you both iudge that thing onely to be good which is honest, and also be free from all perturbation or vexation of minde. disquietnesse. For it is to bee accounted

you haue it not; [and] if you haue it to imploy it vnto. bestow it in bountie and liberalitie. The desire likewise of glorie is to be taken heed of, as I said before. For it plucketh away libertie. freedome of minde, for the which all contention ought to be to couragious men. amongst men of worthie spirits.
                  
                     Neither verely [are] empires to be earnestly desired, & rather not to be receiued sometimes, or now and then to be layed downe. And indeed we ought nor to seeke for rule; but rather, sometimes either not to receiue it, or otherwhile to giue it ouer. We must also bee free from all passion or disquietnesse of minde. perturbation of minde, both from desire, and feare, and also




from sicknesse of mind. griefe, and pleasure of mind. voluptuousnesse, and angrinesse; that quietnesse of minde may be preserued and voidness of care. that we may inioy tranquillitie & securitie, which may bring both stedfastnesse and also dignitie. constancy, and also worthie estimation.
                  But many there are and haue been, who earnestly desiring that same quietnesse. tranquillity of minde, which I speake of, haue remooued. withdrawen thē

                     In which indeed. Wherein verely the opinion of neither [of them] is to be contemned altogether. is vtterly to be despised. But. For the life of the idle or free from great business those who haue betaken them selues to liue quietly, is both more easie & more safe, and lesse grieuous or troublesome to others: but [the life] of them who haue fitted themselues to the commonweale. applied thē

Wherefore peraduenture it may be yeelded to those not going to take, &c. it may bee that both they are to bee borne withall, who doe not taken in hand or meddled with the commonweale, viz. to deale in such matters. vndertake the affaires of the Commonwealth, who being of an excellent wit, haue applied. giuen themselues wholly to quietnesse and to learning: & and also to those. also they who beeing hindred by imbecillity of their health. sicknesse, or some other more weighty cause, haue gone backe [or departed] from the common weale. retired themselues from businesses of the Common—vveale,




when as they graunted. yeelded vnto others both the authority or libertie. power and commendation. praise of managing of the same.
                  But to vvhome there is no such cause. occasion, if they say, themselues to despise. that they con temne those things which most men admire haue in admiration, [as] rule & bearing office. magistracy; I thinke it to be giuen to those not only not for praise, but also for a fault. to those I thinke it worthie to be accounted not onely no cōmendation, but also a fault.
                  
                     The iudgement of whom, in that they contemne glory and coūt it for nothing, is a thing difficult to be done not to allowe or approue. Whose iudgemēt it is verie hard to disallowe, in that they despise glory, and esteeme it as nothing. But they seeme to thinke. fear the trauels and. troubles & griefs

                  Moreouer, both a magnificence. maiestie and contempt. despising of vvorldly things (which I speake of oft. I oft repeat) also quietnesse. tranquillity of minde and voidnesse of care. security is to bee added or practised to them going to take the common wealth. vsed of them, who take vpthem [any] gouernment in the Common-weal, nothing lesse then of Philosophers, I wot not. knowe not whether [not] yea much more I suppose. more also; if so be that they will not bee carefull. ouermuch oppressed

                  Wherefore, not without cause, greater motions of [their] mindes are stirred vp, & greater* enterprises 
                     q maters are meet to be compassed. to bee done by them who manage the common-weale. the gouernours of the Common-vveale,

Moreouer, whosoeuer commeth to performe a businesse. to atchieue any great matter, let him take heed, 1 That hee do not only consider that thing. consider, how honest the matter is, but also, how it may haue a faculty or abilitie to be effected. how it may bee discharged.
                  2 In which same thing. thing it is to bee considered. a man must consider, that hee neither be out of hope. despaire thorow sluggishnesse, or lacke of courage. cowardlinesse, or trust ouermuch nor bee ouer confident thorow a greedy desire. 3 Also a diligent




preparation is to be added. vsed in all businesses, before you goe into them or goe in hand with them or vndertake them. goe about them.
               
               
                  Heere Tully noteth wherein a valiant minde is discerned: to wit, in two things especially. The first whereof is, in despising outward




things. When as a man is perswaded that hee ought neither to admire, not so much as to wish any thing but that which is honest and comely: nor yet to yeeld either to man or passion of mind or to fortune, but onely to right reason.
                  The second is, that when a man is thus disposed in minde, he vndertake the atchieuing of great enterprises, & those such as may bee most profitable; but very hard and full of trauell and danger, both vnto life, and other things appertaining to the com fort therof.
                  

                     Now, hee sheweth that all the glorie, honour and profit arising of these two things, is in this later of them: but the cause and means of making wo
                        •…
                     thie men, is in the former of them; because the despising of all outward things, as riches & honours, is the way to make excellent courages.
                  This againe he teacheth to appeare in these two things: First, if a man iudge that thing onely to bee good which is honest; and secondly, if he be free from all passion and disquietnesse of mind.
                  Because this is, first, to be accounted the




true property of a valiant minde; not onely to set light by those outward things, which 
                        •…
                     eem to most men excellent and singular, but also to cōtemn them with a stable iudgement.
                  And secondly, because this declareth a valiant courage and rare constancie, for a man so to beare the hardest & bitterest things that can fall out in this life, bee they neuer so many, as that hee neuer swarue one iot from the state & order of nature; nor from the dignitie of a wise man, to doe any thing against either of these.
                  

                     And this againe, because it is not meete that hee should bee ouercomne by any inordinate desire, who cannot bee ouercome by feare; much lesse be conquered by pleasure, who hath shewed himselfe vnconquerable by any trauel.
                  Therefore hee teacheth that these things are carefully to be shunned of a valiant man; & also that couetousnesse of money is chiefly to bee eschewed of him. Because there is no such signe of a base minde, as to loue riches; & contrarily nothing more noble, then to despise money if a




man haue it not; & if he haue it, to bestowe it in bounty and in liberalitie.
                  And secondly, that he is to beware of a desire of glory: because that plucketh from him freedom of minde, for which all noble spirits ought chiefly to contend.
                  Thirdly, that he do not proudly seeke for soueraintie; but sometimes not to receiue it being offered, otherwhile to giue it ouer, being had.
                  Fourthly, that hee labour to bee free from all perturbation of minde, as namely desire, fear,




griefe, voluptuousnesse, and angrinesse; that so hee may inioye both trāquillitie of mind & also securitie, wch may bring him both constancy and a worthy estimation.
                  Heere he taketh occasion to speake of some, who earnestly desiring to attain this tranquillitie, haue withdrawne themselues from publike businesses, and betaken them to follow a quiet life.
                  And amongst others some of the noblest and verie chief Philosophers,




and some most seuere & graue men, because they could neither indure the maners of the people, nor the rulers, haue chosen to liue in remote and solitary places, delighting themselues only in their domesticall occasions.
                  Also for these hee sheweth what ends they aimed at herein; viz. the same ends which kings do: that is, That they might neede nothing, obey no man, vse their owne liberty, and indeede liue as they list.
                  Now both these sorts, viz. both Philosophers and great men ayming at this




tranquillity & freedome from all disquietnesse; the one sort, viz. the great men think that they can obtaine it, if they can get great wealth; the other, if they can be content with their owne and with a little.
                  And for these two sorts hee declareth that neither of their opinions are vtterly to be despised.
                  First, because the life of tho
                        •…
                     e who haue betaken themselues to liue priuatly and quietly, is both more easie & safe, and also lesse greeuous and troublesome to others.
                  But the life of those who apply themselues to gouernment, for the good of the commonwealth,




or to atchiue great maters: for the same, is more profitable to mankinde, and also more▪ fit for attayning fame and honour.
                  Moreouer, hee teacheth that many of thē who haue chosen the priuate life may be borne withall in another respect; because beeing of excellēt wits they betake themselves to the studie of learning.
                  As also such as being hindred throgh infirmitie of body, or som other more weighty cause, haue left the managing of the affaires of the commōwealth to others.
                  

                     But for them who, haue no such occasion, and yet withdrawe themselues from publike seruices in the common wealth, onely vpon pretence that they contem
                        •…
                     e those things which most men so admire, as namely rule & magistracy; hee sheweth that hee taketh it to bee not onely no commendation to them, but a fault in them: for that howsoeuer their iudgement may seeme not to be altogether disallowed for despising glory, yet they may withall bee thought to feare the troubles and griefes which




follow such callings, as a certaine reproach and infamie.
                  And then giueth the reason heereof; because some are of such a disposition, as that they agree not with themselues in contrary matters: as, who seuerely contemning pleasures, cannot yet indure griefe; and despising glory, are yet ouercomn with infamy.
                  And therefore hee teacheth that such men who haue the best helpes of dispatch of businesses




are rather to sue for offices, that they may serue the commonwealth, all delaies and excuses set aside.
                  Because otherwise neither can the state bee gouer
                        •…
                     ed, nor their greatnesse and worth declared.
                  Moreouer, he sheweth, that all such as take vpon them any gouernment in the common weale, are to despise worldly things, and to seeke after quietnesse of minde and security, as well as the Philosophers, or more, if that they will not bee ouermuch oppressed with cares, but liue with grauitie and constancie.
                  

                     And thereunto they must striue more earnestly, because the fewer things of the world the Philosophers haue to lose, the more easie is it, to despise it; and also for that they doe not stand in neede of so many things, as the magistrate & great man, neither can fall so grieuously whatsoeuer aduersity doth betide.
                  Likewise, because such great commā
                     ders haue occasions of greater stirrings of their mindes, and for that greater matters are to be don by them, then by Philosophers: whereupon




they haue neede of more greatnesse of courage & freedom from vexations.
                  Lastly, hee giueth three caueats to all that are to atchiue any great matters.
                  1. That they take heede, they doe not onely consider, that the matter bee honest, but also that they haue abilitie to performe it.
                  2. That they weigh all things so wisely, as that they neither despaire, through cowardliness of the effecting thereof, nor yet be ouer cō
                     fident through a greedie desire.
                  3. That as in all businesses,




a man is to vse a diligent preparation; so likewise, as the matter is greater, to be more carefull therein.

                        sheweth by many arguments. reasons [in this Chapter] that it is more valiant. a matter of greater valour, to excell in businesses belonging to the citie then to the warre. in ciuill then martiall feates. warlike affaires, and [speaketh] somewhat concerning himselfe.

For the vvarre vvas managed. maintained by the counsell or direction. aduice of that Senate which vvas constituted or appointed. ordained by Solon. 2 We may say the same thing the same concerning. of Pausanias and Lisander: by whose valorous acts. deedes of armes although the empire is thought to haue bin inlarged to the Lacedemonians. the Empire of the Lacedemonians is thought to haue beene enlarged; yet in very deede they are [not] to be compared to the lawes, &c. not in the least part. compared, no not in the least part to the lawes and order. discipline of Lycurgus.

                     Although this thing in truth is not onely of the domesticall reason, [or a ciuill matter] for it toucheth also the warlike [or belongeth to martiall feats] &c. Howbeit this case indeed is not onely of a ciuill consideration. For it concerneth also the warlike; because it was done by force and by hand. strong hand: yet the very same was done, by citie counsell. the counsell of the Citie, without an army. That also is the best. a worthy [speach] vvherein I heare me to be wont. that I am wont to be inuaded, set vpon or touched. taxed of enuious and lewde

For neither was there euer a greater perill. a sorer danger nor greater hatred in the Common-weale: so that the very weapons slidden speedily out, &c. by our counsell and diligence fell. slipping forthwith out of the hands of the bouldest Citizens, fell [to the ground] by our counsels & diligence. Therefore what so great a matter in war was euer done. What




so great an exploit I pray you, was euer done in warre? what triumph [is] to bee compared [with it?] For (sonne Mark) I may boast with you, For I may bee bolde to glorie before you sonne Marke; 
                     who are to be the inheritor or heyre of my glory and imitator of my acts. vnto whom both the inheritance of this glory, and also the imitation of [my] deeds doth appertaine. In very truth, Cneius Pompeius, a man flowing full. abounding with all martiall praises, gaue me this commendation. attributed this vnto mee many hearing. in the audience. hearing of many, that he said. whenas hee said, that himselfe to beare away in vaine. hee should in vaine haue borne away the third triumph,

Home-valorous acts, then, are not inferior vnto militarie exploits. martiall; wherein also more labour and study is to be put. we are to bestow more labour and studie, then in these. For that reputation, credit. honestie which we seek by a lofty and great. hauty and princely courage, is wrought. effected by the strength. power of the minde, not of the body. Yet the body must be exercised and so affected. brought into such order, as that it may bee able to obey counsell and

But that honestie which wee search for, or earnestly require. search out, doth wholly consist in the care and deuising. casting of the minde. Wherin they bring no lesse commodity, who gouerne the common—vvealth being gowned or robed. in peace, then they that make warre. And therefore wars are oftentimes either not vndertaken. begun, or ended, and now and then attempted, by their counsell. aduice: as the third war of Carthage. Punicke warre [was] by the counsell of Marcus Cato: in which the authority of

Wherefore certainely reason or wisedome of decerning or decreeing is to be desired more, or of. wisedome in ending the warre. determining is rather to be desired, then fortitude of striuing. valour in fighting. But we must beware, that wee doe it not rather for the flight of fighting. auoiding of warre, then for the reason of profit. in regarde of commodity. And let war be taken in hand so. And so let warre be taken in hand, that no other thing but peace may seeme to haue beene

Although this is of a [great] minde or courage, that also of a great wit. this proceedeth from a worthy resolution, that also from an excellent wit, to perceiue by casting things to come. to cōceiue aforehand of things to come; and to appoint. determine somewhat before, what may happen or betide, on either part. fall out on both sides, & what is to be done when any thing shall hap pen, nor to commit any thing. doe ought that at any time it should be said I had not thought; or had I thought of such a matter▪ I had done thus or thus. a man shold say, Had I vvist.
                  
                  

                     These are the workes of a great and lofty courage, and trusting to or leaning vpon. relying vpon prudence & counsell. But to be conuersant rashly in the edge or forefront of the battel. for a man to thrust himselfe rashly into the forefront of the battell, & to skirmis

                  Heer Tully (about to teach that to excel in ciuill affaires, is no lesse commendation, then in martiall exploits, but rather greater) sheweth 1. That whereas most men think the contrary, their




opinion is to be cō
                     futed. And this hee doth,
                  1. By propounding the end which most men aime at in war, to wit getting glory and renowne; especially if they bee of high stomacks and excellent wits, and withal fitted for chiualrie and desirous of warfare by nature.
                  2. By sundry examples both of the Grecians and Romanes, of city businesses which haue bin greater and nobler then the Martiall.
                  The first whereof is taken from the Athenians, by comparing and preferring




Solons counsell for Athens before Themistocles victory. That although Themistocles bee rightly cō
                     mended, and his name more famous then Solons; and also that the victory of Themistocles namely at Salamis bee extolled before that worthy counsell of Solon wherby he first ordained the Areopagites: Yet hee thinketh that indeede, this is to bee adiudged no lesse praise worthie then that, but more, and that for these reasons;
                  1. Because that victorie did good to Athens once onely, but this counsell should doe it good perpetually; for that by this, their lawes and the ordinances of their ancestors should bee preserued




inviolable.
                  Secondly, for that Themistocles said nothing whereby he helped that coū
                     sell concerning the Areopagites: but hee was helped by Solon & by them; because that warre was managed by the counsell of the Senate which was was obtained by Solon.
                  The second example, is from the Lacedemonians, in preferring the discipline of Lycurgus the lawgiuer, before the victories of Pausanias & Lisander.
                  Because although the Empire of the Lacedemonians is thought to haue beene inlarged by their noble exploits yet those are in no part to bee compared to the lawes and discipline of Lycurgus.




Besides that by the means of these, they had their armies more readie and valiant.
                  A third sort of examples is taken frō themselues, in sundrie particulars: as in comparing and closely preferring M. Scaurus before C. Marius; and more lately, Quintus Catulus before Cneius Pompeius, the gouernment & counsell of the one before the Martiall acts of the other. And then giueth the reason of it. Because armes are little worth abroade, vnles there be good counsell at home.
                  3. By comparing P. Nasica a priuate man, to Africanus. That although Africanus was indeed a singular man and a worthy Captaine, yet hee did not more seruice to the




common wealt in taking and razing Numance, then Publius Nasica when he slewe Tib. Gracchus. And how beit that act of Nasica might seem not onely ciuill but martiall, because it was done by force and strong hand, yet it was done by the counsell of the city alone without any armie.
                  This point hee further confirmeth by a worthie and general approued speech of his owne, howsoeuer som enuious and lewde persons did carpe at him for it: to wit, this;
                  

                     Let armes giue place to the gowne, the laurel to the Oratours tongue.
                  The truth whereof he verefieth, instancing in his own example, to omit others,
                  By an interrogation to his sonne, as of a matter notoriously knowne; viz. whether in his gouernment, armes did not yeelde to the robe, whenas (though there was neuer sorer daunger no

                     Now hee asketh him, what so great an exploit was euer don i
                        •…
                      war, or what triumph was to bee compared with it.
                  And then giueth a reason of this his bould glorying therein; That it was but vnto him, his sonne, as vnto whō both the inheritāce of his glory, & the imitation of his deedes did appertaine.
                  And secondly hee declareth further the truth heerof by the franke testimonie & commendation of C
                        •…
                     . Pompeius a singular man for all martiall praises, who ascribed thus much vnto him whenas he said, That it had been in vaine for him to haue had a third triumph, but for




that hee had a place in the cōmon weale through 
                        •…
                     ullies wi
                        •…
                     e gouernment, to inioy the same. Whence hee concludeth, that it is no lesse but euen a greater matter, to excell in ciuill gouernmēt, then martiall acts: and that therefore we are to bestowe more labour and studie in those then in the other.
                  And secondly teacheth, that the honour wch is sought by valour, is atchiued chiefely by the power of the mind, and not of the body; although the body must bee brought in order, to become seruiceable




to the mind for executing businesses and induring trauel.
                  But the honour wch is sought by ciuill gouernment, doth wholy consist in the care and casting of the minde.
                  Thirdly, that they bring no lesse commoditie who gouerne in peace at home, then they that make war abroade.
                  And fourthly also, that by the aduice at home, wars are vsually ordered and managed abroade, for the attempting, beginning and endding of them.
                  This hee instanceth in the third Punike war guided by the counsel of M. Cato, which they obeyed euen after his death.
                  

                     Whereof hee inferreth, that wisedome in aduising & determining or ending war, is to be preferred before valour in fighting.
                  Yet heerein hee giueth this caution: That we do not aduise for the ending of war, onely for auoiding the present danger and trouble thereof, but for the good of the commonweale.
                  And that warre is euer to bee 
                        •…
                     o vndertaken, as that nothing may seeme to haue bin sought in it, but an honest & safe peace.
                  Lastly, hee noteth one other token of a true valorous and constant courage, viz. for a man not




to bee daunted or disquieted so, as to do any thing swaruing from reason, whatsoeuer dangers or euils shall betide; but euer to follow the wise aduice of a presēt resolution. And therefore that he haue not onely courage to resolue, but also an excellent wit to conceiue of whatsoeuer may be likely to fall out; & so to determine afore what to doe; and neuer to doe any thing, whereof he may say, Had I wist.
                  

                     These things hee teacheth to bee the works of a great & worthy courage, guided by prudēce and counsell.
                  But contrarily for a man to thrust him selfe into danger, as into the forefront of the battell, or to fight with the enemie hand to hand rashly & without iust cause, hee counteth it a certaine brutish and beastly thing;
                  Although when time and necessitie doth require it indeede, a man is to fight hand to hand, and to prefer death it selfe before slauery or shame.

                     [Heere hee teacheth] crueltie and also rashnesse [to be] far off frō the dutie of a worthie stomack. 
                        that cruelty and also rashnesse are vnbefitting a valorous man.

                  Heere Tully teacheth, how valorous men are to car rie themselues in the razing and sacking of cities.
                  That they are then to take heed of two faults principally, viz. rashnesse, and cruelty.
                  2. That in the end of all, the victorie being fully gotten, they looke to these three things chiefly: viz. to punish the chiefe offenders; to preserue the multitude or common sort; and finally, to maintaine right and honesty in ech state and degree.

                        How perils are to bee 
                        vndertaken of a valiant man. 
                        aduentured by a valiant man.
                     
                  
                  FOr as there are some (as I said before) who preferre martiall matters or affaires, to ciuill. martiall prowesse before Citie businesses: So you shall find many, to whom dangerous. perillous and subtile. crafty counsels. deuices seeme more bright. gloriouser & grea ter then quiet cogitations or counsels. cō

                  1 we must neuer at all. Indeed wee must neuer commit for flight of perill. so carry ourselues for auoiding danger,




that wee should seeme cowardous, and timorous. cowardes and but. dastards;
                  2 that also is to be 
                           〈◊〉
                        . Yet q we must also take heede of this, that we offer not our selues to. thrust* that. not our selues into dangers without cause; then which, nothing can be more foolish.
                  3 Wherefore in going vnto or aduenturing. attempting dangers, the custome [or guise] of Physicians is to be imitated. wee are to imitate the course of Physicians, doe lightly cure. who vse light cures to men being sicke lightly. them who are lightly diseased; but are inforced to vse pe
                           •…
                        ilous & doubtfull cures. to minister dangerous and doubtfull medicines to sorer sicknesses. more grieuous diseases. wherefore to wish an aduerse [or boysterous] tempest in a calme, is of a mad man. Therefore in a calme to wish a




sore tempest is the part of a mad man; but to helpe the tempest [or make shift in a tempest] by any meanes. preuent the danger of the tempest, by all maner of meanes, is the part of a wise man: and so much the rather if you may obtaine more good, the matter beeing dispatched, then good the matter being doubtfull. when the matter is dispatched, then hurt while it is in doubt.
                  4 and the doing of things. Moreouer, the managing of great attempts. things is dangerous partly to thē who vndertake, partly to the Common-weale. And also some are called into daunger. are brought into hazard of [their] life, others of [their] reputation and fauour of the people. glory, and goodwill of [their] Citizens.




We ought therefore to bee more readie, vnto our owne perils then common [dangers.] to aduenture our own then common perils; and to fight more readily concerning or about honour. for honour and glory, then for other commodities. But there had. haue beene many found, who had. haue been ready to spend not onely [their] substance. mony, but also their life. but euen [their] very life for their Countrey, [& yet] the same would not make the least losse [or hazard] of their glory, not the commonweale requiring. vvould not lose, no not the very least iot of their glorie; no though the Common-weale required it: 1 As, Callicratides, who when he was Captaine




of the Lacedemonians in the Peloponesian war, and had done many things egregiously or very worthily. very notably, ouerturned all at the last. in the end, when he obeyed not the counsell of them followed not their aduice, who thought good to transport. remoue the Nauie from Arginuse and not to fight vvith the Athenians. To whom hee answered, the Lacedemonians, that nauy being lost, to be able to prepare another. that the Lacedemonians, though they should lose that Nauie, might make forth. prepare another, himselfe not to be able to flie. [but] that hee could not fly without his reproach or shame. dishonour. And this was indeede. no doubt a

How much better [did] Quintus Fabius Maximus? Of whō 
                     Ennius [wrote thus;]
                  One man hath restored [our] matter or wealth to vs. State by pausing or prolonging of time. delaying:
                  For, hee put not before mens speeches. preferred not rumors before our safety:
                  Therefore the glorie of the man is famous both after & more. euer the longer his renowne




is more famous.
                  Which kinde of offending or misdoing. fault must also be auoided in citie businesses. ciuill affaires. For there are [some] who although that which they thinke, be neuer so good. the very best, yet they dare not speake it. vtter it for feare of enuy.
               
               
                  
                  Tully, being heer about to set downe some other duties of valour in warre, sheweth, that as there be some such, as prefer martiall prowesse before city businesses; so there are many who thinke subtile and dangerous plots, more glorious then quiet and safe consultations.
                  And heer teacheth, 1. That wee neuer so carrie our selues




in war, as that for auoiding daungers, wee should seeme cowards & dastards. 2. That wee neuer thrust ourselues into daungers without iust cause; for that, that is, of all other, most foolish.
                  3. That in dangers we imitate the courses of good Physicians, who vse but light cures in light diseases; whereas in more grieuous and desperate diseases, they are inforced to vse more desperate cures.
                  The contrarie practise hee sheweth to bee the part of a




mad man rather then of one wise; & to bee as if a mariner should in a pleasant calme wish a sore tempest; wch a wise man should by all manner of meanes seek to preuent.
                  And for this he teacheth, that wee are the rather to labor vnto it; if wee may obtaine more good by it, when the matter is quietly and safely dispatched, thē we could whilst it was doubtfull.
                  4. Whereas the vndertaking of such may be daungerous partly to them who vndertake them, & partly to the commonweale: also that thereby some hazard their liues, others their glorie, & good will of their citizens; hee teacheth




for the first, that we are to bee more readie to aduenture of any perill to our selues then to the common weale:
                  And for the second, that we are to fight more readily for honour and glorie then for other commodities; and so rather to lose life and all, then true glorie. And yet heere hee giueth warning of a great fault in sundry against the former of these two.
                  That there haue beene many, who though they would readily aduenture not onely their money but euen their verie liues for their countries; yet wold not lose, no not the verie least iot of their owne glorie for the same, although neuer so great dammage should come to it thereby.
                  

                     This he confirmeth by three memorable ensamples:
                  1. 
                        •…
                     e of Callicratides a famous captaine of the Lacedemonians, in the Peloponesian war: who hauing there done many things verie worthily, yet in the

                     d ouerturned all vtterly hereby, when he would needes fight with the Athenians contrary to all aduice, and aduenture rather the losse of their whole fleete as it came to passe, then by withdrawing his ships a little and auoiding that fight, to be thought to flee with disgrace; saying that althogh they should los
                        •…
                      their nauy they might prouide a nother, but he cold not flie without his dishonour.
                  A second ensample




is of Cleombrotus another captaine of the Lacedemonians; who vpon the like surmise of disgrace, would needes encounter rashly with Epaminōdas; wherin his armie beeing ouercomne hee vtterly ouerthrew that whole estate.
                  But for the contrary, he sheweth how much better it is, by one worthie ensample in Q. Fabius Max. who deferring to ioyne battel with Anniball vntill hee sawe that hee was able to ouercome him; howsoeuer by delaying hee receiued some present disgrace, yet at lēgth setting fiercely vpon him and ouercomming him▪ recouered eternall glory to himselfe & safety to his countrey, for which hee is so highly extolled




by Ennius in verse.
                  Lastly, hee giueth warning of the like fault in ciuil affairs: for that therin som dare not vtter their mindes for feare of enuy, though they thinke that which is the best.

                     They that shall gouerne the common weale, let them altogether [or euer] keepe two precepts, &c. WHosoeuer shall bee gouernours in the Common-weal, let them euer obserue two precepts of Plato. 1 One [is] that they so maintaine the profit of




the citizens. commons, that vvhatsoeuer they doe, they referre it thereunto, forgetfull. forgetting their owne priuate commodities. 2 Another [is] that they care for or look to haue care for the whole body of the Cōmonweale: lest whilst they defend [or maintaine] any part, they forsake the rest. vphold som one part, they leaue the rest destitute. For as a wardship or custodie of a childe. gardianshippe, euen so the procuration or administration. gouernement of the Common-weale, is to be done. vsed to the commoditie of them who are com mitted [to the gouernment of others. be gouerned] and not of them to whom the gouernment is, &c. it is committed. But they that prouide for part of the citizens, and neglect part. But
who so prouide




for [one] part of the people, that they neglect [another] part, do bring in a most pernicious matter into the Commonweal,
                        q citie. [to wit] sedition and discord: wherupon it happeneth. falleth out, that some seeme people-pleasers. popular, some studious of euerie best [or greatest] man. affectionate to the nobility, [but] few to the
                        q fewe of all. whole. Hereupon great discord or breaches. dissentions sprang amongst the Athenians; and not only seditions, but also pestiferous or sore. pestilent ciuill warres in our Common-vveale. Which a graue & stout citizen, and worthie of principalitie or dominion. rule




in the Commonweale, will fly and hate, and will giue himselfe wholly to the Commonweal, neither will hee follow after or pursue. hunt after riches or power; but. and vvill so defende it wholly. the whole estate that hee may prouide for all [men.] Neither in truth will hee call. bring any man into hatred or enuy by false accusations; but will so cleaue altogether. alwaies so cleaue to iustice and honestie, that so long as, or whilst. so that hee may maintaine it, hee may. will grieuously offend any one. incurre the grieuous displeasure of any; and desire death rather, then forsake those




things which I haue spoken of.
               
               
                  Chap. 29.
                  Tully here, about to set downe some Duties of ciuill gouernours, teacheth that they must euer obserue two precepts of Plato.
                  1. That they alwaies prefer the common




good before their owne priuate, and referre all that they doe, thereunto.
                  2. That they euer haue care for the whole body of the common wealth; lest vpholding som one part, they leaue the rest destitute. For the first of these he sheweth it by the example of a gardianship: That as it is to be vsed for their commoditie who are committed to be gouerned, not of them to whom they are committed; so it must be in the commonweale.
                  For the second hee confirmeth it by a dangerous effect that otherwise may insue; That prouiding for one part




with the neglect of an other, cause sedition and discord, which are most pernicious to the commonweale.
                  And moreouer that some of them seem popular, others set to please the nobilitie, but fewe that regard the whole.
                  The mischiefe hee manifesteth by particular instances, both amongst the Athenians and them selues:
                  That heereupon great dissentions sprung among the Athenians; and not onely seditions, but also pestilent c
                        •…
                     uill wars fel out in their owne cōmonweale. Now these things he teacheth to bee such, that a graue and stout citizen, fit to beare rule will




slie, and giue himselfe wholly to the care of the common wealth, without hunting either after riches or greatnesse; and will so defend the whole state, as he may pro uide for the good of each one.
                  Lastly, hee noteth this as another property of a worthie magistrate, that hee will not bring any into hatred or disgrace by false accusations; but contrarily will euer so cleaue to iustice & honestie, as that he will rather incur displeasure or danger, yea euen death it selfe, then leaue the maintenance & iust defence thereof

                  This hee teacheth by two testimonies of Plato;
                  1. Comparing their contentions to the contentions of mariners




striuing wch of them should gouerne the ship, & in the meane time indanger all.
                  And secondly, directing that wee should take them onely for enemies who beare armes against vs; notthose who striue to helpe to preserue the cō

                  This later sort of contention Tully approoueth by the example of the dissension between P. Africanus and Q. Meteilus, which was for the more safe preseruation of the common weale, without any bitternesse.

                  Chap. 31.
                  Heer Tullie, about to teach that it is the property of true fortitude to moderate anger,
                  1. Reproueth them as vnworthie to be heard, who houlde this opinion, That we are to be exceedingly angry withour enemies, and iudge it to bee the propertie of a valiant man.
                  2. Sheweth that cō
                     trarily nothing is more commendable, nor more beseeming a great & noble personage, then placabilitie & clemencie.
                  

                     Thirdly, that amōg all free people, and which inioy equalitie of lawe, mildenesse & gentlenesse must be ioined with nobleness of mind. Because otherwise the magistrates, being angry either with such as come at vnfit times, or who are too boulde or importunate, fall into testinesse or rage, which is both vnprofitable and odious.
                  Lastly, giueth this caution, that yet gentlenesse and clemencie are so to be approued of, that seueritie be also vsed sometimes for the common good, for that without it a citie cannot bee gouerned.

                        wee must temper our selues especially from anger in punishing. 
                        We must especially abstaine from anger in all kinde of Correction.
                     
                  
                  
                     But both all punishment. ALL punishmēt ought to bee voide of taunting reproch or contempt. contumely; neither to bee referred to the commoditie of him who punisheth any. and not bee done to serue his turne who punisheth or chastiseth in words. rebuketh any, but to the behoofe. commoditie of the Common-weale. 3 We must also beware, lest the punishment be greater then the fault, and lest some be punished for, &c. that the punishment be not greater then the fault; 4 And that some be not punished for the same causes, others be not indeede called, [or spoken to.] not so much as spoken




to. 5 Also anger is to be prohibited [or auoided] in punishing. Likewise, wee must chiefly refrain from anger in punishing. For he that goeth about to take punishment. goeth to punish [others] being angry, shall neuer keepe that measure. mediocrity which is betweene ouermuch. too much and too little. Which mediocritie.

                  But that [affection of angrynesse. affection] is in all cases. things to be refused. eschewed: and it is to be wished, that they that are ouer such as gouerne




the Commonweal, be like of lawes. be like the lawes; which are led or drawne mooued to punish not by wrath. angrinesse, but by equity.
               
               
                  
                  In this chapter, Tully setteth down certaine Duties to be obserued in all maner of correction: as,
                  1. That all punishment and chastisement ought to bee done without contumely, viz. without taunting or bitter speeches or contempt to the partie punished.
                  2. That it bee not done to serue his turn onely who inflicteth the punishment, but for the good of the commonweale.
                  3. That there bee speciall care had, that the punishment be not greater then the fault.
                  4. That all offending alike, be punished




alike; & not some punished, others not so much as spoken to.
                  Lastly, that they who are to punish others doe refraine from anger; and that for this cause chiefly;
                  Because he that goeth to punish others being angry, can neuer keep the true meane which is betweene too much & too little.
                  And for this keeping a moderation, he commēdeth the opinion of the Peripateticks, only dis liking thē for their approbation of angrinesse, affirming it to bee profitably giuen by nature.
                  But for this passion of angrinesse hee teacheth, that it is in all things to bee eschewed: and that it were to be wished, that such as gouern




the common weale should bee like the lawes; which punish, not by angrinesse, but onely by equitie and iustice.

                        It is [the condition] of a valorous man 
                        of a noble courage, neither to wax 
                        arrogant, disdainfull, proud. 
                        insolent 
                        in prosperous things, nor to be east downe in aduerse. 
                        in prosperity, nor to be deiected in aduersity.
                     
                  
                  
                     And also let vs flie greatly pride, disdainfulnes, & arrogancy in prosperous

                         and flowing to our will. MOreouer, in prosperity, and when things flowe euen at our will, Let vs earnestly fly pride, disdainfulnesse and arrogancy. For as




it is a part of inconstancie to beare aduerse things, so prosperous immoderately. a token of lightnesse, to take aduersity [impatiently]; so likewise to vse prosperitie immoderately.

                     Panetius reporteth, Africanus his hearer [or scholar] to haue bin wont to say. that Africanus his hearer & familiar friend, was wont to sai, that like as [mē] are wont. vse to deliuer to tamers [or horsebreakers] horses vaunting with fierceness for their often contentions of battels. to put to riders, horses waxing ouer fierce for their often fights in battel, that they may vse. haue them the readier. more gentle; euen so should men headie, headstrōg. vnbridled

Moreouer, also in our greatest prosperitie, we are especially to vse the aduice of our friends; and a greater authoritie is to bee giuen to them then before. and wee must giue them also a greater authority then before: and at those same. those times wee must take heede, that wee open not our eares to flatterers,




nor suffer our selues to be clawed with flattery. flattered, wherein it is an easie thing to be deceiued. For we then thinke our selues to be such as we may be praised by by right. such, that of right wee may be praised: whereof innumerable faults doe arise. spring; whenas men puft vppe with opinions. conceites, are shamefully scorned, and are conuersant [or intangled.] vvrapped in the greatest errours. in very grosse errours. But truly these matters hitherto. But of these matters thus farre.
               
               
                  Tully, here proceeding to teach other conditions of a noble courage, sheweth,
                  1. That in prosperitie, and when all things flowe according to a mans wil, hee is carefully to shun these vices viz. pride, disdaine, arrogancie, which vsually attend vpon prosperity & great courages.
                  Because as it is a token




of inconstancy and leuitie, to beare aduersitie impatiently; so of the other side to vse prosperitie so immoderately, as to fall into these vices.
                  2. He teacheth that a continuall euennesse kept in all a mans life, and as it were the same coū
                     tenance, and one manner of cheere, is verie commendable.
                  This hee proueth, first, by the examples of Socrates & C. Lelius.
                  Secondly, of Philip king of Macedonia; who howsoeuer he was inferiour to Alexander his sonne, in valorous acts & glorie: yet for continuall gentlenesse 
                        〈◊〉
                      curtesie was so




far superiour vnto him, that he was alwaies noble; whereas Alexander by the contrarie cariage was oft verie base & ignoble, through the vices mentioned.
                  Hence hee gathereth this, as a worthy aduertisemēt; That the higher wee are, the lowlyer we cary our selues.
                  Thirdly, he illustrateth it by the testimonie of Panetius, cōcerning a speech of Africane his hearer and famili
                        •…

                     t to say, and so to vrge this point, by this similitude, That like as men are wōt to put their great horses to riders, to the ende to haue them more gentle, whereas otherwise they would proue ouer fierce, through their often




fights in battel; euen so men beeing too vnbridled through an ouerweening of themselues, are to bee brought within the compasse of reason and learning, that they may throughly beholde the frailtie of all the things of this life, and the inconstancie of fortune.
                  Lastly, he directeth that in our greatest pro

                     peritie wee bee especially carefull to v

                     e the aduice of our friends, & then also to giue them greater authoritie ouer vs then euer before, for the free aduising of vs.
                  And, of the otherside, to take heede chiefely at such times, that wee harken not to flatterers;




nor suffer our selues to bee flattered in any case; because it is so easie a matter to be deceiued by them. for that, listning to thē, we think our selues worthie of what praise soeuer they giue vs: whereof he sheweth, that innumerable euills doe spring; and namely this, that being puft vp with conceitednesse of our selues, wee are oft times scorned and abused very shamefully, & wrapped in verie grosse errours.

Lastly, let it bee increased by discretion. discretion, diligence and sparing. thrift; neither let it lie, or neither that it lie open to, &c. and let it not lie open rather to lust and riot, then to liberality and bountie. It is lawfull for a man obseruing these prescripts to liue. Hee that obserueth these precepts may liue magnifically, &c. roially, grauely, and couragiously or stoutly. stoutly, and also plainely, faithfully, and friendly, to the life of men for the life of man.
               
               
                  
                  Chap. 34.
                  Tully heer (being about to teach that there may be a noble minde, euen in a priuate life, & some Duties thereof) declareth first,
                  That although the noble acts & which beseeme best the greatest courages, are to bee vndertaken by them chiefly who gouern the commonweale, because their gouernment appertaineth to the most; yet that there bee and haue bin many of noble mindes who haue liued a priuate and a quiet life,
                  Who would still be either searching out




or indeuouring som great matters, yet keeping themselues within the boundes of their owne callings & businesses; Or else being of a middle ranke betweene Philosophers, & those that rule the commonweale, haue delighted themselues with their owne domesticall affaires and estate; not heaping vp riches by any ma ner of bad means, nor excluding others from the vse the
                        •…
                     eof; but rather imparting their goods both to the vse of their friends, and of the common weale, if there haue beene neede at any time.
                  Secondly, he giueth certaine precepts concerning the substance of such.
                  1. That it bee well




gotten▪ and not by any dishonest or odiou▪ game.
                  2. That they haue it euer in readinesse for the good of all who stand in neede thereof being worthie, and to whom they are more specially bound.
                  3. That it be increased by discretion, diligence and thrift, & be readie alwaies to be bestowed not on lust and riot, but on liberalitie and bountie.
                  Lastly, he declareth the benefits of obseruing these precepts; that a man may liue royally, brauely and stoutly; and also honestly & profitably for the life of man.

A temperate man, quoth hee, desireth those things vvhich hee ought, and as hee ought, and when hee ought. The head. principall point heereof, is, that the desire obey reason, as the childe [his] Scholomaster. From thence ariseth that comlinesse.

                  IT followeth, that wee speake of that one part of honesty remaining. one other parte of honesty which remayneth, wherein shamefastnesse. bashfulnesse, and temperance, as it were a certaine ornamēt of life. of mans life, and also of modestie, and all quieting of the perturbations. appeasing of the passiōs of the mind, and the measure of things, is seene. That [comlines] is contained in this place. In this place is contayned that [comlinesse] which may bee called in Latin decorum; for




it is called in Greek 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . The force of this. nature heereof is, that it cannot bee separated from honestie: For both that which becommeth is honest, & also that which is honest becōmeth. But what a difference there is of honestie and comlinesse. But what difference is betweene honestie & comelinesse, may more easily. sooner be vnderstood. conceiued then explaned. expressed. For whatsoeuer it is which becometh it then appeareth. doth then appear, when honestie is. hath gone before.
               
               
                  
                  
                  Tully, comming to speak of the fourth fountaine of Duty, viz. temperance, which he calleth the other part of honestie; sheweth first what parts it containeth vnder it: to wit, bashfulnesse & temperance, which he termeth to bee a speciall ornament of mans life: and withal, modesty & calmnesse in appeasing all passions of the mind, and moderation in keeping a measure in all things: and finally that comlinesse wch is called in Latine decorum, as it is

                  Secondly, he teacheth the nature of this comlinesse to be such▪ as that it cannot be separated from honestie: because that which becometh is honest, & that which is honest becommeth; But for the difference that is beween these two viz. betweene honestie and comlinesse, that it may sooner bee conceiued in our mindes then expressed in words; And that comliness doth then onely appeare when honesty hath gone before.

                        There is a double decorum.

                     THerfore it appeareth what is becommeth. decent, not onely in this parte of honesty, whereof we must dispute. wee are to discourse in this place but also in the three former. for both it becommeth one. For [as] it is decent both. to vse reason and speech discreetly, and to doe that which a man should doe aduisedly. you doe, considerately; and also both to see and to defend in euerie matter that which is true. to espie and maintain that which is true, in euery matter; [and. so] contrarily it doth as much disgrace to erre [or misse.] to erre, to slippe, to bee deceiued, doth as much disgrace, as to dote, and to be taken [or distraught] in minde. distract in minde. All




iust things also are comely; and contrariwise all vniust things, as they are dishonest, so they are vncomly. There is a like reason of fortitude. The nature of valour is like hereunto. For what thing. that which is don manfully and with a great courage, that seemeth. seemeth meete for a man, and comely: and what. and that which [is done] otherwise. contrarily, as it is dishonest, euen so it is vncomely.

a certaine gerall meane.

                        q subiect to this, viz. a speciall comlinesse. to euery seuerall parte of honesty.

                     But which part is subiect vnto the generall, they define it thus, that. But they define that part wch is vnder the genenerall [viz. the speciall]▪ in such sort, that they will haue that to be comely, which is so agreeable

                     Therefore a certaine reuerence is to be giuen. There must be vsed therefore a certaine reuerence towards men, both of euery best [or chiefe] man. to euery one of the best sorte, and also of the rest of meaner degree. to others.
                  
                     for it is not onely [the part] of an arrogant man but also dissolute, to neglect what euery one 
                           〈◊〉

                  But there is that differeth. a certaine difference that differeth. 
                     Al in each respect
                        Al. in hauing a respect of men. to bee had, betweene iustice & shamefastnesse. modestie. The parts of iustice are. It it is the parte of iustice not to wrong any by violence. to offer men no violence; of modestie, not to giue offence to to offēd [thē]: wherein the force. nature




of comelynesse is most throughly seene. seene especially. These things therefore thus declared, I thinke it vnderstood or plaine. sufficiently vnderstood, what a one that thing is. what it is which we affirme to be decent. say, to become.
               
               
                  
                  
                  Heere he, proceeding to handle this matter of comlinesse, sheweth, 1. How in a generall maner it appertaineth to euerie part of honesty, viz. to euerie of the other three vertues as well as to temperance.
                  And first, how it belōgeth to prudēce, by a comparison, Because as it is decent to vse reason & speech discreetly, & to doe whatsoeuer a man doth advisedly, and withall both to espie & to maintaine onely that which is true in euerie matter; so contrarily, to erre & to be deceiued, doth as much disgrace as to doate or to bee distracted in minde.
                  

                     Secōdly, how to iustice: because all iust things are comly; and contrarily all vniust things, as they are dishonest, so they are also vncomely.
                  And thirdly, for valour: because that which is done manfully and with a valiant courage is cō
                     ly for a man; & cō
                     trarily, what soeuer is done otherwise is dishonest and vncomely. Whence hee concludeth this first point, that this comlinesse appertaineth to each part of honestie; & that so, as it may be seen therein not darkely or in a hidden maner, but openly.
                  

                     Yet so, as that it can hardly be separated from the seuerall vertues themselues; but that it is rather distinguished, by imagination and in a mans conceipt; then indeede.
                  This hee also illustrateth by a fit resemblance: That as fairnesse of bodie cannot be separated from health; so neither this comliness can be distinguished from vertue, but onely in our minde and conceipt: because it is so wholly mixed therewith.
                  In the second place he cometh to diuide this comlinesse, making it to be of two




sorts, viz. generall and speciall, & then defineth them seuerally.
                  And first, for the generall he sheweth that it is wont to be defined thus;
                  That it is such a comlinesse as is agreeable to the excellencie of man in all things; wherein his nature differreth from other liuing creatures.
                  The speciall comlilinesse is that, which is so agreeable to




nature, as that both moderation & temperance may appear in it, with a shewe of honestie.
                  That the philosophers did take these things so, he prooueth it by the testimonie of the Poets in that comlinesse which they follow:
                  Of whom wee say, That they obserue a right decorum; whenas they bring in euerie person both saying and doing that, which is fit ting vnto him.
                  And contrarily that they should vtterly misle this decorum (As for example) if they should bring in Eacus or Minos




wickedly, it would be very absurde, because they were knowne to bee iust men:
                  Whereas bringing in Atreus so speaking, it wold be verie comly and moue a great applause, because he was a vile man.
                  Also the reason why they obserue this decorum is, Because they iudge by the persons what is comely for euerie one.
                  Secondly, he declareth it frō the work of nature it selfe: because it hath giuen man a personage of great excellencie & preheminence aboue all other liuing creatures.
                  

                     Whence the Poets will, in great variety of persons, discerne what is fitting and what vnfitting to each.
                  And moreouer, for that nature hath giuen vs the seuerall parts of constancie, moderation, temperance and modestie, and teacheth vs withall, that wee bee not carelesse how we behaue our selues towards euerie man; it sheweth vs likewise how far that generall comlineste, which appertaineth to all honestie doth extend it selfe; and also that speciall comliness,




which is seene 
                        〈◊〉
                      euery seuerall kinde of vertue.
                  For the excellencie of this comlinesse kept in euerie action, and how it winneth the approbation of all, he illustrateth by a verie familiar and notable ensample.
                  That as the fairness of the bodie and comlie proportion of euery part mooueth the eies of others, and delighteth them with the grace appearing therein; euen so a comlinesse shining in our life, winneth the good will and liking of all with whom we liue, by obseruing order, cō stancie, and mode▪ ration, in all our words and deeds.
                  

                     Also for the more full accomplishmēt of this comelinesse, he teacheth moreouer that we must vse a certain reuerence towards all sorts, not onely them of higher ranke, but also others of meaner degree. Because this will bring vs a good estimation with all men. Wheras contrarily to bee retchlesse what euerie one thinketh of vs, is not onely a signe of an arrogāt body, but also of one altogether dissolute.
                  Lastly, to this purpose hee setteth downe a difference betweene iustice & modesty:
                  That it is the part of iustice not to offer violence to any; but of modesty, not to offend them; & that heerein the nature




of comlinesse is seene especially.
                  And so endeth this point, what comlinesse is; as beeing plaine enough by that which hath bin said.

But the greatest force. efficacy of comeliness, is in this. standeth in this parte whereof vvee dispute. For not onely the motions of the body, which are apt, or befitting nature. agree vnto nature,




but much more the motions of the minde, which are likewise agreeable vnto nature, are to be approued.

                  So that he sheweth that there is a comlinesse in all these three parts of honestie; yet so, as that the greatest efficacie of it consisteth in this fourth part of honestie, to wit in temperance. And that, because all motions not onely of




the body, but much more those of the minde, if they be agreeable to nature, are approoued and liked of by all.

                  The other sort consisting in reason: which reason teacheth and sheweth plainly, what is to bee done and what to be avoided. Wherupon it is that reason is to rule, appetite to obey. And thēce he sheweth that these properties ought to be in euerie action: 1. That it bee free from rashnesse and negligence; and that so far, as that a man ought neuer to doe any thing whereof hee is not able to rēder a probable reason. For that this is almost the definition of Dutie.
                  

                     2. That our appetites or willes must neither run before reasō through rashnesse, nor leaue the following of it through sloth or cowardlinesse. 3. that our desires and motions must bee quiet & free frō all perturbations & passions of minde; and so thereby all constancie and moderation shal plainly appeare.

                  And lastly, hee further declareth this euen from nature it selfe: That wee are not bred by nature for play and spor

                  This hee teacheth by a comparison in an instance of that libertie which wee graunt to children: That as we graunt not to them liberty of al maner of play, but onely of such playes and sports as are not estranged from honest exercises; so likewise in all our owne iesting and sports, some light of an honest disposition should euer shewe it selfe.

                  And to this kinde of iesting he teacheth that all wittie




speeches of learned men do appertaine; as namely those called Apothegms, gathered by old Cato and others.
                  Thence he concludeth, that the difference between these two kindes, viz. betweene an ingenuous and base iest, is plaine:
                  Also that the one of them, viz. an ingenuous iest is befitting an honest man, especially if it bee done in season and mildely; but that the other, viz. a base

                  Heer he sheweth the meanes how we may keepe a measure in our play and sports. And this point hee teacheth to belong to euery question of Dutie. The first meanes is this; By hauing euermore in minde, how far the nature of man exceedeth the nature of beasts. Which he teacheth to appeare heerein especially, for that they perceiue nothing but pleasure, & are carried thereunto




with all violence: whereas contrarily the minde of man is nourished by learning, and is euer searching out some matter by meditating and deuising or performing something of more worth; and is euermore led with a delight of seeing or hearing some great matter.

                  A second means, to keepe a measure in our pleasures, especially if we bee too much giuen therto, is; So to moderate our diet and apparell, as that wee vse them onely so, as they may bee best




for our health and strength, and not for voluptuousness. A third meanes is, by considering aright what an excellencie and dignitie there is in the nature of man: by the due meditation whereof, wee shall see plainely, how vnbeseeming it is for man to lauish out all riotously, & to liue deliciously & wantonly; and contrarily, how comly it is to liue frugally, continently, sagely and soberly.

                  Tully (still going on to set out more fully the nature of comlinesse, and the fountaine thereof) teacheth.

                  The one of them common; which is in that wee are all partakers of reason and of that excellency whereby we surmount brute beasts: & from this hee sheweth that both all honestie & comlinesse are deriued, & the way of finding out Dutie.
                  The other proper: to wit, that which is properly assigned to euerie one in regard of the speciall constitution both of his body and minde, and therein the speciall differences amongst men.
                  This hee noteth by experience,
                  1. In the bodies, for that we see som to excell in swiftnesse for running, others in strength

                     tenances a maiesty, others being amiable.
                  2. By experience in the mindes, & that therein also are greater varieties and differences.
                  This he proueth by sundry particular examples, and first, amongst themselues: as,
                  That there was much pleasantnesse of speech in L. Philippus, but greater and more of sette purpose in C. Caesar L. his sonne.
                  Likewise at the same time, that there was in M. 
                        〈◊〉
                      sus, though but a young man, a singular grauity; much mirth in Caius Lelius; In Scipio his familiar friend grea ter ambition with more austeritie.
                  

                     Secondly, amongst the Grecians, as he had heard by report; As that Socrates was sweete & pleasantly conceited, and also of a merry discourse, an Eironist in all his speech.
                  Contrarily, that Pithagoras and Pericles were of greater esteeme, yet without any mirth at al.
                  So amongst great Captaines: as, that Haniball of Carthage was very subtle; Q. Maximus one of their owne Captaines, very cū
                     ning




in concealing his purposes, dissimulation, plotting and preuenting the deuices of the enemie.
                  And that among the Grecians, Themistocles the Athenian Captaine, and Iaso the Pherean are renowned for the like.
                  Finally, that Solon the lawgiuer is famous for policy; & namely in that act, where in to the end, that his life might both be safer, and he do the better seruice to the cōmon weale, hee fained himselfe mad.
                  Sundry other examples hee brings




to this purpose not vnlike to the former, to shewe the great varietie of dispositions amongst men.
                  As that there are some plaine and open hearted, enemies to all deceipt:
                  Others who can indure any thing, serue any man, so they may obtaine their desire: as Sylla, M. Crassus, and Lysander the Lacedemonian; though Callicratides, who succeeded Lysander in the admiralty of the nauie, was of a contrarie disposition.
                  

                     Others excelling in curtesie of speech, and in affabilitie; so as thogh they were verie great men, yet could frame themselues to the common sort so, as to winne the hearts of all; like as they had seene in the Catuli both in the father and the sonne, and also in Q. Mutius Mancinus.
                  The like hee sheweth to haue bin reported of P. Scipio Nasica, tho his father, otherwise a worthie mā (as who auenged the mischieuous enterprices of Tiberius Grachus) yet had no affabilitie of speech at all.
                  

                     No nor Xenocrates who was the verie sagest of al the Philosophers, and for that cause a great & famous man.
                  And thus hee sheweth that there are innumerable diuersities of natures and dispositions; yet not to be dispraised.
                  Now in these seuerall varieties and all other hee giueth this rule;
                  That euerie ones owne proper gifts are carefully to bee maintained; thogh not any such qualities as are vicious, yet all such gifts as are naturall, and whereby that comlinesse which wee seeke may be retained more easily.
                  

                     And so long as wee striue not against that nature which is vniuersall, that each of vs follow our own proper nature.
                  Whence hee teacheth this as a second lesson; That although there might be other grauer & better studies to be followed of vs, yet that we are to measure & limitour studies by the rule of nature, to doe nothing against it.
                  Because it doth not auaile to fight against nature; or to pursue any thing▪ wch we haue no hope by nature to

                  And that heereupon it appeareth more fully wherein true comliness consisteth; that we do




not any thing as it were, against nature; but onely that whereto we are fitted by it.
                  Because, if wee euer follow nature, wee shal be able to keep an euen and a constant course, both of our whole life▪ & of e

                  Again, he teacheth that the differences of natures are of so great power, that that may bee commendable in one, which should bee faulty in another.
                  As for example: that one man ought to lay violent handes vpon himselfe, wch should be reproueable in others in the same cause.
                  This hee instanceth in M. Cato slaying himself, rather then to yeeld vp himself to Cesar in Africke as others did; wheras it had bin faultie in the rest of them, to haue done the like, because their liues had bin more




pleasant, and their maners more mild: yet in him it is cō
                     mended, for that he was of such an vncredible grauitie by nature, and had confirmed the same by perpetuall constancie, and al

                  2. In comparing the faults of Vlysses and Aiax together: That whereas this was an honour to Vlysses to haue indured the things wch he did, in his long trauels, and that he had beene able to yeelde himselfe to do seruice to women, as to Circe & Calipso, (if they were worthie to be named women) & to shew himselfe so affable & curteous

                  Hence hee concludeth, that we are necessarily to weigh what gifts each of vs hath properly, & to vse the same aright; and not to

                  This also he vrgeth by a reason taken from players; Lest they should seeme to haue more discretion heerein then wee.
                  Because they chufe not the best interludes to act; but those that are fittest for them, in regard of their pronuntiation,




or gesture, and which they can performe the best; as hee sheweth in sundrie particulars:
                  Whence hee inferreth againe what an absurd thing this is, that a player should see that on the stage, which a wise man cannot in his life.
                  And so shutteth vp this point, That we are chiefly to labor in those things whereunto wee are most apt.
                  Yet here he giueth two cautions.
                  1. That if at any time necessitie shall inforce vs vnto those things to wch we ar not apt by nature; that then wee specially vse all care,




meditation and diligence that we may performe them, if not comlily, yet with as little vncō
                     linesse as may be.
                  2. That we do not so much indeuour to attaine the vertues to which wee haue no aptnesse by nature; as to shun those vices to which wee are by nature strongly inclined.

                        gotten to our selues.

                  In this chapter Tully teacheth▪ that besides those two persons spoken of before, which euerie one hath by nature, we haue other two also.
                  The first whereof is that, which euerie one hath imposed vpon him, by some chance, or in regard of the times: as to bee Kings, Emperours, nobles, honorable, rich, mightie and the like, or such as are contrarie to these: which as they cōsist in fortune, so are they ordered according to the times The later is that which wee fit vnto our selues, according to our iudgement applying our selues thereunto; for that it proceedeth from our own will, what course of life we will follow.
                  

                     Hence are the diuers studies of men; that some applie themselues to Philosophie, others to the ciuill lawe, others to eloquēce, and that one chooseth to excell in some one of these vertues, another in another.
                  More specially, that those whose fathers or auncestors haue bin famous for any kind of glorie, doe for most part

                  Hence also it is that sundrie increase the




glorie of their auncestors: as hee instanceth in Affricanus that hee increased his martiall glory by his eloquence; and in Timotheus Conous sonne who by his wit and learning augmented the renowne which hee had receiued from his auncestors by their martiall praises.

men wee vvould be. haue our selues, and in. of what kind of life: Which consultation or aduice. deliberation is the hardest of all other.

And therefore hee is entangled with some certaine kind and course of liuing, before then. that hee could. bee able to iudge, what should be best. For that Prodicus saith wheras Prodicus saith, Hercules. that Hercules (as




it is in Xenophon) so soone as he began to haue a beard, or came to maturitie or ripenesse of yeares. began to come to mans estate, (which time is gran ted by nature, to chuse what course or trade of life each will follow vvay of liuing euery man will enter) to haue gone forth. went forth into solitarie place or wildernesse. a desart place, and sitting there, doubted long and much with himselfe. long with himselfe and much, when he beheld two waies, the one of pleasure, the other of vertue, whether of them it should be. were better to enter into.

                  And that howsoeuer Hercules (as




Xenophon reporteth) at this age of youth, when he began to come to mans estate, going into a desert place, and there beholding two waies, the one the way of plea sure, the other of vertue, & after long deliberating with himself whether of them he shold take, made choice of the better; viz. the way of vertue:
                  Yet, this hee thinketh might befall to Hercules being sprung of the seed of Iupiter, & so of a diuine vnderstanding and iudgemēt: but that there is not any hope that any of vs should make such a choice.

                  Chap. 49.
                  Heere T. proceedeth to shewe more specially how comlinesse may bee retained in all these, viz word, deede, motion, gesture, that we may bee approued of all.
                  And first, that wee are chiefly to follow nature heerein likewise:
                  That as it seemeth to haue had a great




respect of our body, hauing sette in open view our coū
                     tenance and the rest of our shape, wherin the principall comlinesse is; but hid those parts wch beeing giuen onely for necessitie of nature would bee vncomly to looke vpon so the modestie of man doth & ought to follow this so cunning a worke of Nature: which he declareth euidently he

                     reby;
                  Because what things nature hath hid, those all who are wel in their wits doe keepe fo
                        •…
                     th of sight; and do what they can to serue




the necessitie of nature as secretly as may be.
                  Likewise, of what parts of the bodie there are more seruile and base vses, they doe not somuch as call them or their vses by their owne names. So that, that which it is no shame to do so it be secretly, yet it is vncleanly to reporte.
                  Whence it is, that the doing of those things openly cannot be without impudencie, no nor the verie speaking of them can be free from dishonestie. And heere he confuteth & reproueth the Cynicks as vnworthy to be heard




and also the Stoicks who were almost Cynicks in this point, who vsed to scoffe at them for this; because they affirmed that these things are shameful to bee vttered, in words, which are not dishonest indeede: and yet they vsed to tearm other things by their owne names, which were dishonest & vile indeed, as namely to rob, cos

                     ut to beget children a matter honest in it selfe, they accounted vncleanly to be vttered.
                  This and other like reasōs they brought against modestie.
                  

                     But for answere heereof hee setteth downe this as a sure rule;
                  That we are heerin to follow nature, & to shun euery thing which our eyes dislike to beholde, or our eares to heare. So likewise that our standing, going, countenance, eyes & gestures keep the same decorū, as that they may be approued of all.
                  And here he giueth warning of two principall faults:
                  1. To beware that we doe nothing e

                  The other, that wee doe not any thing rudely or clounishlie.
                  After, he vrgeth this point for obseruing comlinesse:

beautie, to wit fairnesse and maiestie; that fairness belōgeth more properly to the woman, as more comely for her, maiestie to the man as more gracing him. Whence he giueth these lessons:

                  2 That they neither vse ouer, violent motions like wrastlers, nor too much gesture or other foolish toyes like players; but that such as are most plaine are best.

                  This later hee giueth speciall warning to preuent by the inconueniences following thereof; as shortnesse of breathing, changing of the countenance, disfiguring the face; whence ariseth a great presumption of lacke of staiednesse in the party.
                  7. That yet aboue all these, wee looke to the motions of our mindes, that they swarue not frō nature.
                  And withall teacheth how wee may attaine thereunto; viz. if wee bew are that we fall not into passions, and apply




our mindes to preserue comlinesse.
                  Lastly, hee giueth this aduice, That whereas the motions of the minde are of two sorts, som of the thoghts others of the appetite; that wee carefully imploy our thoughts about the verie best matters, and euer make our appetites obedient to reason.

                  3 For the more vehement; that sith




our voice is giuen vs to be the declarer of our minde, and that in it wee seeke these two things, that it be cleare and sweet; hee teacheth that although both of them are to bee fetched from nature, yet they may be much helped; the clearnesse by continuall exercise, the pleasantnesse by imitation of them who speak most pithilie & pleasantly.
                  That these two doe exceedingly cōmēd the voice, he prooueth by instances in the Catuli, who were thought to be of exquisite learning, & to excell others, who were as learned; and to surpasse others in the Latine tongue, only




because their pronuntiation was so sweet.
                  Their letters were neither too much mouthed, nor drow ned in their pronū
                     tiation, lest their speech should haue bin either darke or vnpleasant. Their voice also without strayning, neither too weake nor too shrill. So that although the speech of L. Cr. was more flowing & no lesse conceited, yet for eloquence the Caruli were in as great estimation.
                  Lastly, hee teacheth by the example of Caesar, Catulus fathers brother, that each should labour to excell in wit and pleasant conceipts;




that heereby, in his verie familiar talke he went beyond the eloquēce of others; And therefore concludeth that we are to take paines in euerie one of these, if we seek to attaine what is decent in euerie matter.

                  1. That it hee altogether voide of anger, because in it nothing can bee done well or aduisedly.
                  2. That it be done in as milde a maner as may be, yet tempered with grauitie, that a wholesome




seueritie may bee shewed, & all contumely auoided.

of them who are present.
                  Lastly, hee giueth this aduice, that in speaking of our owne matters, wee beware how we report any great things of our selues especially false, seeming to imitate therein the glorious souldier, with the scorning of the hearers.

                  Chap. 53.
                  Here T. desirous to pursue euery point wherein comlinesse may consist, cometh to buildings, for the order and decencie to bee obserued in them.
                  

                     And first, for the house of a Prince or an honourable man, he giueth this precept, That althogh for the frame and forme of it, it must be fitted especially according to the end of it, which is chiefly the vse thereof: yet notwithstanding that there must be a due respect had, to the state and comlinesse of it, meet for the place and honour of the owner.
                  This hee sheweth, 1. By the example of Kn. Octauius, the first that was Consull of that familie: who by reason of a goodly house which he had built in the palace, yet such as was befitting him, is reported, not onely to haue receiued much honour, but also through the concourse




of the vulgar sorte to view it, and of other beholders, to haue bin aduanced to the Consulship; being otherwise a man but new ly comne vp.

                        •…
                     e, but also shame and miserie in the end, whē hee was not able to maintaine it.
                  And therefore heer he giueth two rules to this purpose.
                  1. That a mans honour is to be set out




by his house, and not to bee wholly sought from his house.
                  2. That the maister is not to looke to be graced by his house, but his house by him.
                  A second precept for such buildings is this, That a man therein haue regard not only of himself, but also of others.
                  And therefore in great mens houses into which many strangers are to bee receiued, & a great number of all sorts to bee admitted, there must bee speciall prouision for conuenient roome, so as it may bee large enough, and the owner able to main tain the port▪ that it may euer be wel fild; for that otherwise a large house may proue a disgrace




to the maister if it come to be solitary, especially if it was euer well filled by another maister.
                  This disgrace hee exaggerates by the odious speeches of the passers by, as might be truly verified of many in his daies.
                  A third precept is, that in such buildings a measure be kept for sumptuousnesse and magnificence.
                  

                     Because thereby otherwise ariseth much euill, euen by the example. The reason is: for that verie many do earnestly imitate the workes of princes chiefly, in this behalfe, although they neuer regarde their vertues.
                  This he instanceth in L. Lucullus a singular man for vertue: yet none imitated him in that; but verie many in the sumptuousnesse of his man our places. And therefore hee concludeth, that in all these things a measure is to bee kept, and all to bee reduced thereunto: and finally that that same mediocritie is to be referred to the common vse and ornament of life.

                  A third thing is, that wee take heede, Al. 
                     
                        Al. that those things which appertaine to an honest shew be moderated by dignitie. that we moderate those things which appertaine to liberality, by an honest shew and dignity. seemly grace. And the best meane is, to keepe that comelinesse, whereof we spake before; no

                  2. That wee consider wisely of each matter which wee desire to bring to passe; and so also of a meet diligence for the sure effecting thereof, and neither more nor lesse care




then the matter requireth.
                  3. That in things which chiefely appertaine to honesty, wee euer moderate all, by retaining a decent shewe and seemely grace according to our place & estate; and in all things euer to striue to keepe that comlinesse which hath bin taught; & and not to goe beyond it.
                  Finally, he concludeth, that yet of these three this is the chiefe, That appetite euer obey reason.

                     furthermore wee must speake. NOw wee are to speake of the order of things and opportunity of times: and herein is contayned that science or skill. know ledge which the Grecians name. call

is thus defined of the Stoicks: that moderation. discretion is a science. the knowledge of placing or disposing. setting those things which shall bee done or said, in their owne. proper place. And so it seemeth there will be the same force or property. power of order and placing or disposition. disposing things aright. For thus also they define Order, to be a framing or ordering things. a composing of things in apt and fit. conuenient places. Also they say, place to be of the action, opportunitie of the time. And place they say belongeth vnto action, but opportunity vnto time. Also the seasonable [or fit] time of an action. the time conuenient for the doing of any thing

                      Latine it is called occasio. So it commeth to passe. it is, that this discretion, which wee interpret, as I haue said, is a knowledge of the opportunity of fit times to do a thing. seasons to doe any thing. But. Yet there may be the same defini

                     , viz. discretion, or keeping order.
                  2. He teacheth how




this is defined by the Stoicks, viz. That discretion is a science of setting those things, which are done or said, in their proper place and order. And so maketh it nothing but a facultie of ordering & disposing things aright. Because thus they define order also;
                  That it is a composing of things in apt and conuenient places; And say that place belongeth to action, but opportunitie to time.
                  3. For the time cō
                     uenient for the doing of things, hee first sheweth it by the names; that it is

                      is a knowledge of the opprotunities, or fit seasons to doe any thing,
                  Also that prudence (spoken of before) may be defined after the same maner.
                  To conclude this chapter, he sheweth that heere he speaketh concerning discretion and temperance, and other vertues like vnto them, hauing spoken before of prudence and the properties thereof, in the right place; and




that now he is only to speake of such other vertues, as appertain to modesty, and to gaine the good likeing of them with whom we liue.

                        What 
                        becommeth. 
                        is decent in euery place and time, and vvhat

                     we are therefore to keepe such an order. SVch an order then of our actions is to bee vsed. obserued, that all things be fit and agreeable among themselues, as in a constant oration, so in the life. that as in a well framed oration, so in [our] life all things bee fit. apt and agreeable




among themselues. For it is a dishonest thing and very faulty, in a seuere. sage matter to bring in any speech meet for a feast, or delicate. to bring in any table talke, or wanton speech. Well spake Pericles, vvhen he had Sophocles the Poet his collegue or fellow. ioyned with him in the Pretorship▪ 
                     and they had talked of the common Dutie. and these two were cōmuning about their office; and a faire boy passed by, by chāce. as by chance a well fauoured boy passed by, and Sophocles had saide, Oh faire boy

Now if Sophocles had spoken this same in the approbation of wrastlers, or where wrastlers are allowed or tried. in a place of approbation of wrastlers, hee had wanted. beene free from iust reproofe. So great force there is both of place and time, that if any man, when hee is to plead a cause do muse. meditate with himselfe in his iourney, or in his walking, or deuise any matter more attentiuely. think of any other thing more seriously, he may not be reproued; but if he doe the same thing the like at a feast he may be thought vn

In which kinde it is not amisse or inconuenient. incommodious to iudge by others, what a one. of what sort each of them is: that if any thing bee vndecent in others, wee our selues also may auoid it. For it comes to passe, I know not by what meanes. I wot not how, that wee see more

Therefore in learning, [those scholars] are very soone corrected, whose faults the masters doe imitate for the cause of amending [them.] counterfeit, to the end to amend them. Neither indeed is it amisse to adde learned men, or also those who are skilfull by practice, to chuse those things, which may bring doubt, and to search diligently concerning euerie kinde of duty, what liketh them to vse the aduice of learned or experienced men, for the choosing of those things, vvhich may bee doubtfull, and to q enquire what liketh them concerning euery kinde of Duty.

In which things wee are not onely to consider, what euery one speaketh, but also what euery one iudgeth. thinketh, and also why each man thinks so, or what their reason is. for what cause each man thinketh so. For as painters, & they who frame signes or make pictures. picturers, and also the true Poets euerie one desireth his work to be considered of the common people. are desirous to haue their workes seene of all sorts of men, that if any thing bee reprehended. found fault with by many, it may be corrected; and they doe diligently examine. enquire both vvith themselues and others, vvhat is missed or faulty therein. done amisse in it: So very many things are to bee

As for those things that are done by custome. after the custome and ciuill institutions. ordinances, nothing is to be giuen in precepts concerning them: for these verie things are precepts. there is no precept to bee giuen of them: for they are precepts of themselues. Neither ought any man to be led. caried with this errour, that if Socrates or Aristippus haue done or spoken any thing against the [vsuall] maner and ciuill custome. ciuill order and custome, he shold thinke the same thing to be lawfull

To the sum [or summarily] that I may not deale of euery one. In a word (that I may not intreate of euery particular) we are bound to loue, maintaine and preserue the common reconcilement and consociation of the whole kinde of men. agreement, and

                  Chap. 56.
                  In this chapter T. being to shew what is decent in euerie action, time and place, teacheth,
                  1. That such an order is to bee kept in all our actions, that in our whole life, all the parts and euerie thing therein, bee apt both for place and time, & agreeable




amongst them selues; like as in a wel framed oration. And secondly, that of the contrary it is dishonest and verie faultie, to doe that which is vnbeseeming in any action. As for example: If a man in a sage matter, should bring in table talke, or any wanton or idle speech.
                  This he confirmeth by a witty speech of Pericles: who when Sophocles the Poet was ioyned with him in the pretorship, and they two were of a time cō
                     muning about matters of their office; as by chance a faire boy passed by, Sophocles saide, Oh faire boy! Pericles reprehending him, spake thus vnto him again: But Sophocles it becommeth a Pretour to haue




not onely stayed hands, but continent eyes also.
                  Now concerning this speech T. sheweth, that if Sophocles had vsed it in some other place, as where maisteries are beholden or the like, he had beene free from any iust reproofe: whereas doing it in this place and at this time, hee was iustly reproued, for that ther is such great force of time and place herein.
                  3. Hee setteth it forth by another example illustrated by a comparison of contraries, thus; If any man when hee is to pleade a cause, doe meditate of it in his iour
                        •…
                     ie or as he is walking, or doe then think
                        •…
                      more seriously of any other matter, he is not disliked: whereas if he shold




doe the like at a feast, hee would bee thought verie vn
                        •…
                     iuill, for hauing no regarde of time or place.
                  4. Hee teacheth, whereas some disorders are so gros
                        •…
                     e, and so far disagreeing frō all ciuility, as they neede not greatly any admonition or precept, as to sing in the pleading place or the like; that wee are therefore to shun more carefully those faults which seeme to bee but small, and cannot be perceiued of euery one but only of the wise, for that they are to iudge euen of the least disorder.
                  This he teacheth by a fit similitude taken from musiciās; who auoid the least iarre in their instruments, because the verie least is easily




obserued, of the skilfull: and so wee likewise are to demeane our selues in our whole life, that nothing chance to iarre therein. And that this wee are to doe so much the rather, as an harmony of deeds, is greater and better then a harmony of soūds. Then, where as it may bee said, But how shall I come to discerne of these little faults; hee answereth it by a fit similitude;
                  That as the musicians eares doe perceiue euen the least discords, in instruments, by a diligent obseruation and cōparing of sounds; so we, if we will be
                        •…
                      diligent markers & iudges of faults, shall be able to vnderstand euen the least.
                  Secondly, he giueth




speciall direction how we may iudge by others: viz. by obseruing the fixing of their eyes, the smooth looking or bending of their browes, their dumpishnesse, mirth, laughing, speech, silence, or ouer much lifting vp or falling of their voices, or the like; so in them to iudge what was don fitly, what otherwise, And then what we haue obserued to bee vndecent in others, to auoide the same in our selues.
                  After, he giueth the reason hereof.
                  Because it vsually commeth to passe, that we see more in




others then in our selues if any thing be ami
                        •…
                     se, and so do better amend our faults thereby.
                  This he confirmeth by an instance in scholars, who are the eas
                        •…
                     yest corrected, by their masters counterfetting their faults, to let them see the ill fauourednesse of them.
                  5. Hee directeth what meanes are best, to know what is the fittest in euery kinde of dutie, and so in all doubtfull matters; viz. To vse the aduice of learned or experienced men herein. Because the greater part of men is vsually caried whither




they are led by nature.
                  Therefore wee are not onely to consider what euery one speaketh▪ but what he thinketh▪ & why he thinketh so; wch wise men can giue the best reason o
                        •…
                      and so to vse them chiefly.
                  And that we are to doe herein as painters, pictureres and Poets; who are not only desirus to haue their workes seene of all sorts, that if any thing be generally or iustly disliked, it may bee amended: but also to this ende do diligently inquire, what is amisse in the same. Euen so that




we are to doe, or leaue vndone many things, according to the iudgement of others, and likewise to change and to amend them.
                  6. Hee giueth this rule: That in what things we haue customes & ciuill ordinances to follow, we carefully obserue them; For that they are precepts of thē selues, and so need not to haue any pre cepts giuen of them. And that we are not by any priuate mans ensample, though neuer so wise or of the greatest authoritie, to be drawne to do or speake any thing against ciuill orders and customes; no not by the

                     nsample of Socrates or Aristippus. Because they might haue




that liberty by their great and diuine gifts, which wee cannot haue.
                  Yet here hee giueth a caueat, That for the fashion & guise of the Cynicks, it is wholly to bee reiected, as contrary to all modestie, without which nothing can be right or honest. Lastly, he giueth some fewe other particular directions, concerning this point, and so concludeth: as,
                  1. That we ought specially to obserue and reuerence them whose liues haue bin throughly tried in honest and great matters; chiefly being sound louers of the commonweale, hauing alreadie deserued well of the same, &




aduanced to any honour or place of gouernment.
                  2. That wee much respect olde age.
                  3. That we yeelde & submit our selues to them that are in office.
                  4. That wee put a difference between citizens and strangers; and yet in the very strangers to consider whether they came of their owne priuate busisinesse, or about the affaires of the commonweale: And in a word to looke carefully to this generall, as comprehending many particulars;
                  That each knowe himselfe bounde to loue, maintaine & preserue the common agreement & societie of all sorts

                  First, those gaines. kinds of gaines are disallowed which run into the hate of all. which are odious to all, as [the gaine] of customers taking tole of hauens. tolefarmers, and




vsurers. The gaines also of all who serue for hire or wages. all hirelings, whose labour and not their arts are bought. whose labour is bought & not their cunning, are seruile & base. for the very hire in them. For in them the very wages. hire is [as it were] the obligation or presse-money. bond of their bondage. seruitude.

in truth can the workehouse. shoppe haue in it any ingenuous thing. any thing beseeming a gentle-man; and in no wise are those trades to bee approoued which be seruers of pleasures; [as] Trinkermen. fishmongers of great fish, butchers, cookes, puddingmakers, fishermen, as, Terence speaketh: adde to these, if q you it please you. please, list. perfumers, dancers, and all makers of sweet oyles, or perfumers. play at dice.

And furthermore, if it beeing satisfied. satiate or rather content with gaine, as it hath oft comne from the deepe. sea to the hauen, so [it shall change or be changed into lands and possessions to settle thereon. betake] it selfe

                  Chap. 57.
                  T. in this chapter still pursuing this point of comlinesse and honestie, cometh to speake of trades and kindes of commodities; and teacheth in the first place, what sorts of them are to bee accounted liberall and honest, what base according to the common esteeme of men.
                  And first hee reckneth vp sundry of those kindes which are disallowed as base and odious: As, 1. The trades and gaines of tolefarmers & vsurers.
                  

                     2. The gaines of all sorts of hirelings, whose labours are bought, & not their cunning. Because in them their hire is, as it were, the bond of their seruitude.
                  3. They who buy of the marchants such commodities, as they presently retaile againe.
                  For that these vsually gaine little or nothing, vnlesse they lie exceedingly: then which he sheweth that nothing is more dishonest.
                  4. He teacheth that all kinde of handycrafts men serue in base occupations;




because that in truth, the shop cannot haue, in it, any thing beseeming an ingenuous or free man.
                  5. Aboue all other, he accoūteth those trades most base, which are for seruing the pleasures of men: as of fishmongers, butchers, cookes, pudding makers & the like, and more specially perfumers, dancers, and all gaining by dicing and such vnlawfull games.
                  In the second place hee sheweth what arts are to bee accounted liberall and honest.
                  As first, All arts & sciences, wherein there is either greater wisedome required, or no small gain sought: as namely physicke, casting plots for buildings;




and so all maner of learning of honest & worthie matters; for that these are comly for them, for whose state and degree they are conuenient.
                  2. Marchandize, which howsoeuer being small, it is accounted but base; yet if it be great, bringing in commodities from forraine countries, and dispersing the same into many mens hands for the common good, so that it be without lying, is not much to bee dispraised, but rather commended.
                  And especially if the marchant, being thereby sufficiently inriched, shall content himselfe and buy




lands & possessions therewith, to settle himselfe thereupon, for the good of his countrie.
                  3. Of all things from which gaines are sought, he preferreth husbandrie, for that nothing yealdeth greater increase, nothing more pleasant, nothing meeter for a free borne man.
                  But for this matter of husbandrie, hee referreth vs to his booke de senectute, where he hath written of the delight of it at large, that from thence we may learne whatsoeuer wee desire in this behalfe.

But a contention of those very things which are honest, may oft fall out. Yet of those same things which are honest, there may fall out oft times a question, and a cō

And that wisdome which the Greekes tearme or name. call sapientia.

So it commeth to passe, that the consociation. accōpanying together of men &




common society, far surmounts the study of knowledge. Neither is it true which is saide of certaine. some, therefore this. that therfore this community & society with men, to be for the necessitie. is for the necessity of life, because wee could not attaine nor bring to passe. effect without others, those things wch nature might desire. For if so be that all things which appertaine to the food & ornament of life. furniture of life, were afforded or found. ministred vnto vs as is were, by the diuine rod. grace of God, as they say; then euery one of the best wit [or of an excellent wit.] of a good wit, all businesses omitted or▪ set aside. omitting all other businesses, would

                  [And] therefore euery dutie which appertaineth to maintaine the coniunction, &c. to the maintenance of the neighborhood & society of men, is to be preferred before that duty which is contained. consisteth in knowledge and science.
               
               
                  
                  Chap. 58.
                  T. hauing finished the first maine question concerning honesty, to wit, how Duty may be deriued from the foure chiefe fountaines thereof, and also whether the thing to be deliberated of be honest or dishonest; cōmeth now to the second question, arising from the comparing of honest things amongst themselues: viz. Of two honest things propounded whether is the more honest: which point hee sheweth as before, to haue bin omitted by Panetius.
                  Secondly, he giueth the reason heereof: That all honestie springeth from out of these foure foū
                     taines,




                     viz Prudēce, Iustice, Fortitude, Temperance; that in the making choice of what duties wee are to performe, we vse oft to compare these among them selues. And 
                        〈◊〉
                      hee teacheth, that those dut
                        •…
                     es are more agreeable to nature wch spring from our communitie with others, viz. from Iustice, then those which are fetched from prudence; and so to bee preferred before them.
                  This he confirmeth by sundry argumē
                     
                        •…
                     s from the necessitie of humane societie, from which the duties of Iustice doe proceede. Which societie he sheweth to be so necessarie, That if a wise man should happen on such a life, that hee




should be inriched with all abundance of good things, and should haue both abilitie & leasure enough to contemplate and consider of all things worthy the knowledge of mortall man; yet if his solitarinesse, should be such that hee could not see a man, hee would wish much rather to die then to liue.
                  Secondly, frō that wisedome which is called in Greeke 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , and in Latine sapientia, from which these duties of Iustice & communitie are likewise deriued:
                  This wisedome he sheweth to bee the princesse of all vertues, and distinct from that which is called in Latine prudentia, & in Greeke 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which




is defined thus, viz A knowledge of things, meet to bee desired or eschewed:
                  Where as this wisedome called sapientia is the knowledg of diuine and humane things, wherin is contained the cōmunity of Gods and men, and their societie amongst themselues.
                  Whence hee reasoneth thus:
                  If that vertue of wisdom from which these duties proceed be the greatest and as it were the princesse of all vertues, that then these duties flowing frō it must needs be the greatest also. And that they doe proceede hence, hee proueth further; for that the contemplation and knowledge of nature is maimed




and vnperfect, if no performance of deeds follow
                        •…
                     : which performance he declareth to appeare especially in defending the commodities of others, and so appertaineth to the societie of man-kind; & therfore to bee preferred before meere knowledge.
                  Thirdly, he proueth it by the examples of the best disposed men; who vse to cast aside all duties of getting knowledge, whatsoeuer, that they may helpe their countrie in any extreame perill. For example, he asketh this question, who there is so studiously set in searching out the nature of things, if tidings should be brought him of a suddaine,




of some great imminent perill of his countrie, which hee might bee able to preuent; though he were contemplating matters most worthie of all other to be knowne, which would not yet cast aside all those studies: yea although hee thought hee should bee able by his searching, to number the starres, and to measure the greatnesse of the world.
                  And moreouer, for that hee would not onely doe this for his countrie, but euen in the verie cause of the perill of his parents, or friendes. Whence he concludeth euidently againe, that




the duties of Iustice appertaining to the profit of mankinde, then which nothing can bee dearer vnto vs, are to be preferred before duties of knowledge.
                  Fourthly, hee further demonstrateth it by other generall ensamples in this kind. As,
                  First, in that they whose studies and whole life haue bin spent in seeking out the knowledge of things, yet haue not withdrawne themselues from indeuouring to inincrease the commodities of men. As those who haue instructed many, to make them the better citizens, & more profitable to the




commonweales. Of this sort hee giueth sundrie ensamples: as,
                  1. Of Lysias the Pithagorean philosopher, who instructed Epaminondas of Thebes.
                  2. Of Plato, who taught Dion the Siracusian, and many other haue done the like.
                  3. Hee sheweth for himselfe, that whatsoeuer benefit hee had brought to the commonweale (if he had brought any at all) he had attained vnto it by beeing himself instructed by teachers, and so furnished with learning.
                  Secondly, in that such doe not onely instruct them that are desirous of learning, whilst they




are aliue and present with them; but they also effect the same euen after their death much more effectually, by the monuments of their learning left behinde them.
                  Thirdly, in that they omit no point which might concerne the lawes, customes & discipline of the commonweale: so that they may seeme to haue imployed all their leasure for the benefit of posteritie.
                  Thus hee sheweth, that they being giuen to the studies of learning, bestowed all their wisedome and vnderstanding for the good of the commonweale, and so did euer preferre duties belonging to the societie of men.
                  

                     Fourthly, he prooueth it by this instance▪ That for this cause alone it is bet ter to speake copiously, so it be wisely, then to meditate most wittily without vtterance.
                  Because meditation serueth only within ones selfe, but eloquence serueth for the good of all with whom we conuerse, and many others. Fiftly, because wee could not deuise nor effect matters sowel alone as with others. This hee proueth by a fit similitude taken from Bees: That as they swarme together, not to the ende to make combs, but being thus swarming by nature doe make their combs more ea
                        •…
                     ily; euen so and much more also, men being of a




sociable nature, do vse their cunning in doing and deuising much the better & more speedily.
                  Sixtly, in that know ledge separate from iustice or imployment for the common good, remaineth fruitlesse and barren. And so likewise fortitude or valour separate from humane societie & friendship, viz if it be not vsed for the good of others, is nothing else but sauagenesse & cruelty. Whence he concludeth, Duties appertaining to the societie of men to




bee far greater then the studies of know ledge.
                  Lastly, he answereth an obiection of som, who affirmed, that wee vse duties appertaining to societie, for our owne necessitie (for that wee could not effect nor attain with out others, those things which nature might desire) & not for the good of others.
                  Wherevnto hee answeres; That if this were true, then if a man had all things necessary for liuing, ministred (as it were) by the grace of God, without any labour or helpe of others; if the same man were of a good wit, hee omitting all other businesse would




wholy imploy himselfe in knowledge and science.
                  But he teacheth that this is false; Because euen such a man would still flie solitarinesse, and seeke some companion for his studies, and would desire still both to teach and learne, to heare and speake.
                  And therefore vpon all these groūds he concludeth this point, That euerie dutie which appertaineth to the main tenance of humane societie, is to be preferred before such as consist in knowledge and science.

                        Whether Iustice or Tēperance be better.
                     
                  
                  
                     That preaduenture may be asked. THis question may peraduenture be well asked, whether this cōmunity which is especially apt. most agreeable to nature, be also euer to be preferred before moderation and modestie. temperance? It pleaseth not. I thinke not so. For there are certaine things. som things partly so filthie. dishonest, partly so haynous, that a wise man wold not doe them, no not for the cause of preseruing of, &c. for the preseruing of his country. Possid. hath gathered many of them together; but some. certain of them so foule. vile [&] so filthy, that they




may seme filthie or dishonest. shamefull euen to be spokē. Not any man therefore shall vndertake these things for the cause of the commonweale. These things therefore ought no man to vndertake for the cause of the Cōmonweale, neither indeed would the Commonweale them to be vndertaken. haue them vndertakē for her sake. cause.
                  But this matter hath it selfe more commodiously. stands so much in better case, for that there a time cannot happen. can befall no time, that it should benefit or further concerne the Commonweal, for a wise man to do any of them. Wherfore let this be concluded in chusing of Duties, such kinde of Duties to excell especially, which is kept in the societie of men. that such kind of Duties excel most, wch cō
                     cerne the society of men. For considerate dealing▪
                      wise performance will follow




knowledge & prudence. So it commeth to passe, that to doe aduisedly to performe [our] actions considerately, is better. of more [worth] then to deuise or think of, or ponder wisely wisely to meditate. And indeed let these things [suffice] hitherto. And thereof thus farre. For the place it selfe is set open. this point is sufficiently layd open, that it is not a difficult thing. difficult in the searching out of Duty, to perceiue. see what is to be preferred of euerie one or what [duty] is to be preferred before euerie other. what euery one is to preferre. Moreouer, in that the communitie it selfe. that very cōmon society, there be degrees of Duties, whereby it may may be knowne what one is aboue the other. of wch it may bee vnderstood what excelleth euery other: so as. that the first [Duties] be due] to the immortall Gods, the next. second, to




[our] country, the third to [our] parents, furthermore the rest are due to others by degrees. & so forth by degrees, Al. the rest are due to the rest. to others.
                        Al. some. Of which things disputed briefly, or handled shortly. thus briefly discoursed of, it may bee vnderstood, men to be wont. how men are wont not onely to doubt that thing. to doubt, whether a thing be honest or dishonest, but also two honest things being, &c. of two honest things set before them. pro pounded, whether is the more honest. honester. This [common] place. point (as I said before) is omitted of &c. ouerslipped by Panetius. But now let vs goe forwarde to those things which remaine. proceed to the residue of duties. the rest.
               
               
                  
                  Chap. 59.
                  Heere 
                        •…
                     . proceedeth to speak of the cōparing of duties; and first, somewhat in comparing the dutie's of Iustice & Temperance, sheweth that this question may chance bee propounded; Whether duties of societie be euer to be preferred before others of moderation & temperance. Whereunto he answereth, that hee thinketh not so; and giueth his reason, for that there are some things partly so dishonest partly so hainous, that a wise man would not doe them, no not for the preseruing of his countrie. Of this sort hee sayth, that Possidonius hath gathered many: certaine whereof are so odious that they are shamefull




to be vttered. Now, these hee teacheth that a wise man ought not to vndertake, no not for the cause of the commonweale, neither that indeede the commonweale would haue them vndertaken for her cause. But for these he sheweth that ther cannot befall any time wherein it can concerne the good of the commonweal for a wise man to doe any of thē. And therfore, notwithstanding all these, he concludeth this point concerning the choosing of duties;
                  That euermore such duties be preferred which concerne the good of others; And that wise performance of our actions will




euer follow knowledge & prudence. Whereupon it commeth to passe, that considerately to per forme our actions for the good of others, is more worth thē to meditate wise ly. So he shutteth vp this whole matter as sufficiently layed open, that in the choosing of duties it is not difficult to see what euery one is to preferre.
                  Lastly, for the ending of this whole treatise, & the right performance and preferring of duties, hee aduiseth to remēber that which was taught before; That in the common societie, there are degrees of duties, whereby it may be best vnderstood what duties are especially to be preferred and and performed first and chiefely.
                  

                     As first those which are due to God; next, such as are due to our countrie; thirdly, those to our parents, and so the rest according to degrees as they are due to others in order.
                  And thus finally he sheweth, that wee may easily vnderstand by the things handled before, both these questions, whereof men are wont to doubt, viz. first, whether a thing be honest or dishonest▪ Secondly, of two honest things propoūded, whether is the honester; which was ouerslipped by Panetius. And so prepareth himselfe to proceede to that which followeth.
