               wen:
            Triumphantlie by worthie Peeres
            whoſe famous deedes were knowen.
            Amids which troupe was choſe, Mal
                     •
                  erophus the faire:

               phes,
            like Angels did prepare.
            But one among the crewe,
            was Sillerae vnkinde:
            Whom to requite with ſeuere doome,
            the Gods a way did finde.
            So he who ſcorned loue,
            had like for like ordaind:
            The Knightes on Steedes, with ſtaffe in hande,
            to Iuſte and ſporte attaind.
            O cruell fate, and curſed ſtate:
            Preparde, faſt ſnarde,
            For ſuch a ſcornefull mate.

               out her caſt:
            She hied, time ſpied,
            To weare her ſorrowes paſt.
            Vpon a greene willowe, there hanged this Ladie:
            A Tragicall ending, beleeue me as may be.
            
               Malmerophus miſſing the ſight of his Louer,
            went wandring hether and thether:
            And thought if he met her, with faire words to proue her,
            he did ſo, they met both together:
            With ſprite all appalled, and colour cleane changed,
            he cut down his Lady in vayn:
            And found in the Sampler, the words which ſhe fayned,
            that bread this great dolour and payn.

                made no more to doo:
            But there he ended too.
            Her Sampler off he tooke:
            And ſo his life forſooke.
            FINIS.
