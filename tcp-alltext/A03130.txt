               Of Rebels that thought to deuower vs all.
            
            
               REioyce with me ye Chriſtians all,
               To God geue laude and prayſe:
               The Rebels ſtoute haue now the fall,
               Their force and ſtrength decayes.
            
            
               Which hoped through their Traitrous traine,
               Their Prince and natiue ſoyle:
               To put by their deuiſes vaine,
               Vnto a deadly foile.
            
            
               And with their Armies ſtoute in Feilde,
               Againſt their Prince did riſe:
               And thought by force of Speare and ſheilde:
               to win their enterpriſe.
            
            
               It was the Erle of VVeſtmerland,
               
               that thought him ſelfe ſo ſure:
               By the aide of his Rebellious bande,
               his countrie to deuoure.
            
            
               The Erle eke of Northumberland,
               
               his Traitorous parte did take:
               With other Rebels of this Lande,
               for Aue Maries ſake.
            
            
               Saying they ſought for no debate,
               Nor nothing els did meane:
               But would this Realme weare in the ſtate,
               That it before hath ben.
            
            
               What is that ſtate I would faine know?
               That they would haue againe:
               The Popiſh Maſſe it is I trowe,
               With her abuſes vaine.
            
            
               As by their doings may apeare,
               In comming through ech Towne:
               The Bibles they did rent and teare,
               Like Traytours to the Crowne.
            
            
               And Traytours vnto god likewiſe,
               By right we may them call:
               That do his lawes and worde deſpiſe,
               Their Country Queene and all.
            
            
               The lawes that ſhe eſtabliſhed,
               According to Gods word,
               They ſeeke to haue aboliſhed,
               By force of warre and ſword.
            
            
               Forgetting cleane their loyaltie,
               That to their Prince they owe:
               Their faith and eke fidelitie,
               That they to hir ſhould ſhow.
            
            
               And rather ſeeke to helpe the Pope,
               His honour loſt to winne,
               In whom they put their faith and hope,
               To pardon al their ſinne.
            
            
               That if they ſhould their natiue Land,
               Their Queene and God denie:
               They ſhould haue pardon at his hand,
               For their iniquitie.
            
            
               Therfore with thoſe that loue the Pope,
               They did their ſtrength employ:
               And therby ſteadfaſtly did hope,
               Gods flocke cleane to deſtroy,
            
            
               And then ſet vp within this Land,
               In euery Churche and towne:
               Their Idols on Roodeloftes to ſtand,
               Like gods of greate renowne.
            
            
               Their Aulters and tradicions olde,
               With painted ſtocke and ſtone:
               Pardons and Maſſes to be ſolde,
               With Kerye leyſon.
               
            
            
               Friers ſhoulde weare their olde graye Gownes,
               And Maides to ſhrift ſhould com:
               then Prieſtes ſhould ſinge with ſhauē Crownes
               
                  Dominus Vobiſcum
               
            
            
               All theſe and ſuch like vaneties,
               Should then beare all the ſway:
               And gods word through ſuch fantaſies,
               Should cleane be layd away.
            
            
               But like as god did them deſpiſe,
               Which were in Moyſes dayes:
               That did a calfe of gold deuiſe,
               As god to giue him prayſe.
            
            
               And for the ſame Idolatry,
               In one day with the ſword:
               Did thre and twenty thouſand dye,
               That did neglect his worde.
            
            
               The Children eke of Iſraell,
               In Ezechias time:
               He made among their Foes to dwell,
               That did Committe that Crime.
            
            
               But when that Ezechias praied,
               To God to helpe his owne:
               The Lorde forthwith did ſend them aide,
               Their Foes weare ouerthrowne,
            
            
               A Hundred Thouſande Eightie Fiue,
               By Gods Aungelles weare ſlaine:
               And none of them were left aliue,
               That toke his name in Vaine,
            
            
               
                  Senacheris alſo the Kinge,
               Then of the Aſſirians:
               As he his God was honouring,
               Was ſlaine by his two Sonnes.
            
            
               Like as he did thoſe Rebels ſtill,
               Which did his flocke purſewe:
               From time to time of his free will,
               By force of Warre ſubdewe.
            
            
               As Hollifernus and the reſt,
               He put them ſtill to flight:
               That had his little flocke oppreſt,
               In preſence of his ſighte.
            
            
               So hath he now theſe Rebels all,
               Through their vngodly trade:
               Caſt downe into the Pit to fall,
               That they for others made.
            
            
               To whom ſtill daily let vs praye,
               Our noble Queene to ſende,
               A Proſperous Raigne both night and day,
               From her foes to defende.
            
            
               Her and her Counſaile, Realme and all,
               During her noble life:
               And that Ill hap may them befall,
               That ſeeke for Warre and ſtrife.
            
            FINIS.
