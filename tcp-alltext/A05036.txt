            To the Reader.
            COnsidering the reformist Preachers are now become the BB•. trustie actors in their most conning & cruell enterprises, who erewhile would make the world belieue that they neither pleaded for the BBs. tooke their ministrie from them, submitted it vnto them, or subscribed vnto their proceedings, no

I thought it therfore my duetie (that the truth of these things might appeare) to giue thee to vnderstand how they haue behaued themselues in this busines, & what was the power of their weapens in conference against those men, whom they haue so r

And to make the matter more euident, I haue at the latter end anexed certeine Arguments, giuen their cheif Teachers lōg agoe to haue answered by writing, the which they haue (as these Prisoners report) closely put vp, and with an euill conscience spoken euill in their Pulpits, in stead of consent & repentance.

come to light to thy saluation. And (to my grief) I must desire thee to remember, that the Preachers are to nothing more vnwilling, then to grant these sillye men a free conference, making no scruple in the meane time to speak all maner euill sayings of them, vnconuicted by them of anie error or crime, which bewrayeth both their corrupt wayes wherin they walke, that may not be brought to triall, and also their spirit to be voide of true Christian loue, howsoeuer they pretend outward holines.

            The summe of the Conference betwixt Mr. THOMAS SPERIN & me HENRY BARROVV vppon the 14 of the third Moneth in the Fleet, as nere as my ill memorie could carie away.
            
               SPER.
               FIrst Mr. Sperin signified vnto me that he was sent by the Bishop of London to confer with me concerning certeine things that I was said to hold, Namely that there was no Church in England.
            
            
               BAR.
               I answered that for the Bishop of London I had nothing to do with him, neither he with me; what I hold concerning their Church of England the Bishhopps knew long agoe, & neuer as yet would grant either publicke or priuate conference, where the Booke of GOD might quietly decide the cōtrouersies betwixt vs; but they had ymprisoned me in close & most streight ymprisonment now two yeares & well nigh an half, besides manie more greeuous iniuries offred vnto vs, as publishing vs Heretikes, Schismatiks, Anabaptists, Recusants, turbulent, sedicious, & what not in their Pulpits, priuileged bookes, sparsed libells, accused vs for such vnto ou

                  cke Sessiōs &c. Therfore I had iust cause to suspect anie conferencc that he could send vnto me, considering his manifold mischeivous practises against the Gospell & true seruants of CHRIST continually.
            
            
               SPER.
               Herevppon Mr. Sperin protested his comming to be in loue to conser brotherly & christianly with me, not vnto my harme or preiudice anie kinde of way, and began in some faint

               I said that could not be, he was a grievous enemy vnto the trueth, to CHRIST, and his Saintes, now holding aboue 60. of them in sondry Prisons without cause, lawe, or conscience; Y

                  me vnto me, for so I would not denie anie kinde of conference at anie time, which was in my power to grant; but I said that I merueled to see him come now in the BBs. name, because I had heard he had sometymes bene otherwise minded.
            
            
               SPER.
               To this he answered that he euer thought reuerently of the Bishopps, both for their learning, as also because her Maiestie hath authorised them.
            
            
               BAR.
               I shewed their vnlawfull ANTICHRISTIAN Beastlike power & authoritie, as also their barbarous hauock they exercised in the Church, confounding & subuerting all Gods ordinances, & setting vp their owne deuises in stead therof; And therfore they that reuerence theis men call CHRIST execrable, & worship the beast.
            
            
               SPER.
               Here Mr. Sperin obiected against me the place of IVDE, that I despised gouernment, & spake euill of them in authoritie.
            
            
               BAR.
               If the things I haue spoken be true, or that their authoritie be not of God (both which I affirme & will approue by the word of God) then you greatly iniure both this Scripture & me.
            
            
               SPER.
               Their authoritie is of God, in as much as it is of the Prince.
            
            
               BAR.
               The Prince cannot make lawfull that which God forbiddeth, namely to haue & exercise both ecclesiasticall & ciuile authoritie, as this man doth from whom you come.
            
            
               SPER.
               I iustifie not his ecclesiasticall authoritie, but that authoritie he hath from the Prince.
            
            
               BAR.
               If he be a ciuile magistrate whie is he called a Bishop, & vsurpeth an ecclesiasticall function?
            
            
               SPER.
               May not ciuile magistrates be called Bishops?
            
            
               BAR.
               I neuer read that they were so in the new Testament, yet I acknowledg they are called Shepheards in EZEKIEL & MICAH, but this man we speake of was fometimes a Parson of a Towne, if not of more then one, then an Arch-Deacon, now a Lord B. which offices by their vse appeare, and by the lawes of our land are held to be ecclesiasticall.
            
            
               SPER.
               Much is to be giuen to the Princes authoritie.
            
            
               BAR.
               We will afterward speake of the Princes authoritie, let vs first enquire of theis their offices.
            
            
               SPER.
               I will not here reason furder of them; For there were manie in the windowes, & by this time was my keeper retorned with paper & ynke, which he was a litle before sent for.

               SPER.
               The parish assemblies vvhich haue preaching Ministers vvho for life and doctrine are vnreproueable, and vvhich themselues pr

               BAR.
               Hereunto I set downe this other Proposition.
               
               Your parish assemblies as they generallie consist of all prophane, vvicked &c. mingled togeather in one bodie, vvorshipping God after the deui

               I denied also his Proposition, Namely that there were anie such parishes which made such profession of faith & obedience, and had such a Minister as he spake of, which he endeuored to proue thus.
            
            
               SPER.
               They are as lawfull Churches of Christ, as the assemblie of beleeuers in Corinth vvas a lawfull Church of Christ; But tha

               Your first Proposition is denied.
            
            
               SPER.
               What soeuer was necessarie to the decerning of the Church of God in the assemblie of Corinth, is in our assemblies.
            
            
               BAR.
               It is still denyed.
            
            
               SPER.
               The profession of faith & obedience, ministrie & Sacraments, were the necessarie pointes wherby to discerne that Church, but theis we haue in as good or better maner then they.

               Your Church of England hath no such office as the Teachers Office, yt hath no other then Vniuersitie Doctors, which are not in anie office, or therby Ministers: I wene also he hath a dumbe Minister one that cannot preach for his Pastor; so that he is a hireling Curat & no Christian Teacher. As for Mr. GARDINER & your self, you be parish Parsons, & therfore cannot be held christian Pastors.
            
            
               SPER.
               I deny your Argument, it followeth not because they are termed Parsons, therfore they are not Pastors.

               Both the name & Office are diuerse, therfore not the same.
            
            
               SPER.
               The Parson is called in latine Rector Ecclesiae, which name properly agreeth to the Pastor.
            
            
               BAR.
               Your latine name is popish, one of the names of blasphemie written vppon the heades of the Beast, for CHRIST hath appointed many to the office of gouerning & ouerseeing, & not the Pastor only: And therfore this name is not proper to the Pastor.

               To say the trueth neither the one nor the other do gouerne but stand in most miserable & seruile subiection to the BBs. & to their substitutes: or if this gouernment should be their owne (as you surmise) most Antichristian it is, & such as no true Pastors or Elders may execute in the Church of CHRIST: But are you not afeard Mr. SPERIN thus to glose & counterfet to couer these marked souldiours of the Beast, with the names and titles of Christes Officers? will you set downe this vnder your hand?
            
            Whervppon Mr. SPERIN set downe this Proposition.

               BAR.
               Those are wonderfull gouernours as euer I heard of, I had thought theis Church-wardens had rather bene the Collectors or Deacons of your Church, because they gather & dispense th'almes of your Churches. But now to your Parsons, they haue a diuerse and discrepant 1. Name 2. Office 3. Entrance vnto their Office both in Election & Ordination, 4. Administracōn, 5. maintainance or lyuing: For all which reasons seuered, & ioyned none of your Parsons can be true Pastors.
            
            
               SPER.
               The name of Pastor is of no moment, for they are also called Gouernours & Ouerseers, aswell as Pastors.
            
            
               BAR.
               But this name of Pastor is only peculiar & doth distinguish the office of the Pastor from others, & so doth neither the name

of Elder nor Ouerseer, but being in Counsell & gouernment common to him with others, are also gyuē indifferently to him with other: Therfore this name of Pastor is of great monent & can neither be altered nor spared, as wherby the wisdome of GOD doth both distinguish & expresse the Office, therfore if you take away or change this name, you also take away & change the Office, no other name that can be deuised by man sufficing to distinguish & expresse this Office, as this doth.
               Thus the time not suffering to follow or vrge the other pointes alledged against this Office, we for this time ceased; Mr. SPERIN making promise to come againe, and if he could to bring some other with him.

Likewise, that though

one man executed sondry Offices of the Church at one tyme, yet this his ministerie in them all is lawfull also; Yea though the Bishop execute a strange & tyrānicall ministerie, neuer read nor heard of in the Testament of CHRIST, vsurping authoritie ouer so manie Churches & Pastors, possessing the very Chaire of ANTICHRIST, corrupting & changing the whole ministerie and Ordinances of the Gospel&c. Yet are they to be esteemed true Ministers of CHRIST, & their ministeriall actions good. Theis & sondrye other enormous & blasphemous Doctrines you strowed emongst vs, and sought to confirme them by these & such lyke poysoned distinctions, Not simplie euell: Not simply vnlawfull. Good in parte. Though it be vnlawfull to execute diuerse Offices, yet are not his actions therein vnlawfull; Though his Office he executeth in the Church be vnlawfull, yet are his ministeriall actions lawfull.

First we say, there was no cause you should expect to haue euery thing wrytten, that was then spoken, both in regard of our fraile & slippery memories, as also that we signified vnto you our intent to be but to summe vp the discourse of such cheif pointes as were then handled, willingly passing by other impertinent and lesse necessarie speaches. But yet, if you can call anie to remembrance which may anie way benefit you, or preiudice vs, if you shall signifie them vnto vs, we will most willingly insert them. For the order we will not greatly contend, because it is of lytle moment vnto vs; Yet is there cause we should aswell remember it as you, because we were both alyke in the action, & had the Propositions before vs, which you knowe were writtē, as the matters fell out in handling. But now touching your other chardges of adding, peruerting, falsefying &c. Surely if theis things stoode thus, great were our sinne toward God & towards you; Yea woe vnto our selues, if we should walke vvith such festered consciences: Hovv should vve thē appeare before God or men vvith comfort? Though the measure of our gyfts be smale, yet God accepteth the vvorke of his ovvne Spirit: We need not, neither euer did defend his most plaine & pure truth against the most subtile & malignant aduersaries, vvith lyes, falsefying, sclaundering &c. muchlesse in this actiō as you chardg vs. No God is vvitnesse vnto our consciences, vvith vvhat care & vprightnes vve haue set dovvne these things, being guyltie to our selues of no such crimes as you accuse vs. Yea for our further clearing herein, vve haue set dovvne no one poynt of importance vvhich vve tooke not in vvryting from your ovvne mouthes, euen before your eyes, & read it in your presence, and in the hearing of sondry honest vvitnesses: vvhich Propositions & vvitnesses, still remaine to be produced in record of the truth, against you or vs, vvherein vve depart frō the same. And surely much better had you prouided for your ovvne credit, and much more impeached ours, if you had set downe some perticulers, vvherin vve had thus falsified & peruerted, before you had in this maner reproched vs, especially being requested thervnto by vs; vvho, not trusting to much to our ovvne memories, first sent our Copie vnto the vvitnesses, then vnto you, to correct or reproue vvhat you dislyked or thought amisse therein, vve being alvvayes ready & most desirous to alter it, according

to the truth: But you, as though there were no Iudge in heauē, no witnesses in earth of the things that passed betwixt vs, haue most boldlye, without all feare, shame, or truth denied euē what your owne mouth vttered, accusing vs as voide of all vprightnes & true dealing, full of partialitie &c. and all to hide your owne corrupt estate, & the vanitie & weaknes of your defenses from the eyes of the world: Not being able, nor daring to produce or alledge anie one pointe in perticuler, which we haue eyther falsified or peruerted, least you should be taken & reproued, as your associate Mr. SPERIN was this other daye in the exceptions he tooke, both by theis written prapositions, & by sondry eare witnesses that were present vnto his face; Yea euen of that heynous perilous Propositiō

Alas Mr. EGERTON, what shall you gaine by this? Suppose you to buyld or repaire your credit vppon or by the ruynes of ours? Can you immagine to stay the course of that truth which God hath sent forth by so manie witnesses which heard you? Or can you think by these vaine threats to stop our mouthes frō testifying or publishing this or anie other truth of our God vnto all men, by all meanes? We feare not the curse causeles, neither shunne we the light. Our Religiō & honestie we willingly submit, both in this or in anie other thing we affirme or doe, to the christian iudgment of all men.

But such is ours: Therfore our ministerie is not lawfull. For answeare wherof, I denie your Assumption or minor Proposition, and returne the same reasons vpon your head thus.

               ut a short & sudden demonstratiō of the truth of these Positions which you haue collected out of our Letter, and as rashly pronounced, lyes; we doubt not, your present euill estate & bad dealing shall as sodenly lye open vnto all men, & to your self also if you be not of those euill men and imposters the Apostle speaketh of, that shall goe forward to the worse, seducing & being seduced &c.
            Touching your cattologue of lyes wherof you accuse vs, we thus through the grace of God shall cleare our selues, and shew the truth of as manie as we acknowledge &c.
            The first Lye you chardge vs with, is, that your bare affirmations are held authenticall of your auditorye. Our answere is, That you haue drawen an absolute Proposition from conditionall words.
            
               We in our Letter reproued you for not adding Doctrine to your lypps, some proofe to your assertions, saying; that except you would haue your owne bare affirmation to be held as authenticall with vs as it is with your miserable auditorie, that haue no power or freedome publicklie to censure or reproue anie false Doctrine that you publickly delyuer &c. Here is in these words no vntruth; be your Doctrines neuer so blasphemous & pernitious, your Church hath no power presently & publickly to cē
               sure you or them, but must ioyne vnto you still in prayer & Sacraments, vntill their Lord Ordinarie redresse the matter; or if he will not, they must then swallow all vp, how impious soeuer they be. Lo
                     •…
                  ke for this lawe in the booke of your aduertisments in the Articles for doctrine & preaching. Now howe far your Doctrines are authenticall to that woefull people, that haue no power in themselues to call them into question, to examin, trye, or censure thē, iudge you; Yea how Authenticall you would haue your owne bare affirmations esteemed, let these your 3. letters shew; where you haue not added one reason to proue or disproue anie thinge you affirme or denie, but your owne bare word: But they must not be so with vs, who meane to examin them by the Scriptures before we receiue them. The word authenticall peraduenture we had not vsed, had not you gyuen occasion in your former letter in these words. I trust my affirmation shalbe as authenticall as yours. Which presumptuous words you would not haue vsed, if you had not thought well of your self, and some speciall authoritie to be gyuen to your words; As for vs, we seeke no credit furder then we speake according to truth; neither hold or would haue anie thing held authenticall, besides or with the holy word of God.
            The second lye should be that it vvas sufficiently proued in our last Conference,
               2. 
               that your BBs. vvere that Antichrist.
            
            2. This we doubt not to affirme, & you cannot deny but yourScriptures in steade of Lyes. Bishopps were there proued to vsurpe both Ciuile & ecclesiasticall Offices & iurisdiction; that they hold & execute diuers ecclesiasticall Offices of your Church at one time: as to be Doctors,

Lyes: the vvorst vve vvish you is, that you had neuer made, or els had now broken this vngodly oath, & that you had clearly cast of their antichristian yoke, & had deliuered your soule from them, and that you durst indeede boldly speake & stand against their Antichristian authoritie & vngodly proceedings: vve are willing vppon theis condicōns, for your so great good, to suffer more then a lytle reproche.

            The summe of a confuse conference had the 3 of the 4 Moneth, betwixt Mr. SPERIN & Mr. COOPER, IOHN GREENVVOOD & HENRY BARROVV in the Fleet.
            AT the first being set downe at the Table, Mr. SPERIN vsed certaine speach openly in way of prayer.

               SPER.
               I vsed it for my self & such as would ioyne vnto yt.
            
            
               GREN.
               If for your self, yt was to Pharisaicall, & not to haue bene publicke: As for vs, you know we would not ioyne vnto yt.
            
            
               SPE.
               All actions ought to be vndertaken with prayer going before.
            
            
               BAR.
               But prayer ought to be made with one accorde, where with one mynde & one mouth they may praise GOD the Father of our Lord IESVS CHRIST Rom. 15. 6.

               CHRIST & his Apostles vsed prayer when they reasoned with the aduersarie.

               That is not so. vvhere finde you that?

               Your prayers & all your actions are accursed in this popish ministrie you execute.
            
            
               SPE.
               None will say so but such Schismatickes as you, that haue rent your selues from the Church.
            
            
               BAR.
               Yt should seeme you know not what either a Schismaticke or the true Church is: Haue we so largely disprooued your church vnto you at your former being here, yet you now call vs Schismatickes, not being able to approue your Church.
            
            
               SPE.

               There are manie witnesses of this assertion. But I will bring you

vnto it by circumstances, or conuince it by profe. Did you not denie to meddle with that time, because neither you nor I were of age to remember yt?
            
            
               SPER.
               That is true.
            
            
               GREN.
               You then confessed, (& it is manifest) that all the people were then receiued to the Sacramentes, without anie conuertion by Doctrine.
            
            
               BAR.
               You confessed also that this was done by force, & did not alowe therof.
            
            
               SPER.
               Neither doo I now alowe of it, if it were so.

               Whie should you make question of so cleare a thing? we proued it: as also that all your parishes now consisted of the same people & their seed, had still the same ministrie, worship, gouernment &c.

               I then denied & still denie, that the people or ministrie are the same.

               Before we can iudge the false Church, it is expedient that we discerne the true Church, which is thus described in the scriptures.
            
            THe true planted and rightlie established Church of CHRIST is a companie of Faithfull people: seperated from the vnbeleuers and heathen of the land: gathered in the name of CHRIST, whome they truelie worship, and redily obey as thier only King Priest and Prophet: ioyned together as members of one bodie: ordered and gouerned by such officers and lawes as CHRIST in his last will and Testament hath therevnto ordeyned: all and each one of them standing in and for thier Christiā libertie to practise whatsoener God hath cōmaunded & reuealed vnto them in his holie word within the limites of their callings, executing the lordes iudgements against all trangressió and disobedience which ariseth among them, and cutting it off accordinglie by the power which thier lord and King CHRIST IESVS hath comitted vnto them.
            Now who so shall measure thies parish assemblies as they generally stand in England, by this rule: shall euidently finde them in euerie point so transgressing and defectiue: as he that hath eyes to see, or but a will to search cannot be deceaued or mistake these parish Churches for the true churches of Christ.
            Thies parishes consisting of a company of prophane & ignorant people: gathered by the sounde of a Bell in the name of Antichrist: worshipping God after a false & Idolatrous maner: denying all obedience vnto CHRIST in his 3. offices as thier only King, Priest, and Prophet. lyuing in disorder among themselues: standing in confusion being disordered and ouerruled by such lawes & officers as the Pope left and not as CHRIST left, standing in bondage to the Romi
