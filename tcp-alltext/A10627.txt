            To all Fauourers of Learning or the Learned.
            
               ABout ſome tenne yeares agone, when the Supplication of Pierce Pennileſse was publiſhed; the Gentleman who was the author thereof, being mine intimate and neare companion, as one with whome I communicated both my loue, mine eſtate, and my ſtudies, and found euer out of his diſpoſition an equall, or if poſtible a more feruent ſympathie of loke community and affection, ſo as I can not chuſe but ſtill take much delight in his memory; would many times in his priuate conference with me, vnfolde his determination touching the concluding and finiſhing vppe of that moral and w

parte by the ſame title (as heepublikelie did proteſt in an Epiſtle to the Printer ioynde to the ſame treatiſe) his reſolution was to accompliſh his deſire by writing the returne of the Knight of the Poſte, & therin did many times at large, diſcourſe the maine plot and drift, wherein hee meant to beſtow great arte, witte and laborious ſtudie. Now death who many times by an yn charitable or cruell Anticipation preuenteth thoſe deſeignes, which might adminiſter much matter of regarde and commoditie, by taking him too earelie frō the world, who had he liued, woulde haue enricht it with much wittineſſe, left that vneffected, which had it beene by him taken in hand, would doubtleſſe haue ſatisfied many learned expectations. Now my ſelfe who euer challenged moſt intereſt in his loue, and neareſt allyance to his counſailes, ſeeing the turbulencie of this laſt age, and the frantike madneſſe where with the Deuil infecteth the minds of moſt trayterous and wicked perſons, I tooke in hand (albeit as vnfit as Patrocles
               
for Achilles armor) to finiſh vp what hee in former times had intended, wherein if I haue neither the wittie pleaſantnes of his conceites, nor the gaulye bitternes of his pens ſharpenes, to the firſt imagine me of a more ſolide and dull compoſition leſſe affected to delight and variation of humors, and to the latter think it is a bōd whereto I haue bound my ſelfe euer ſince my firſt natiuitie, rather to wiſh my ſelfe dumbe then by foule ſpeech, vncomely parables, or fantaſticall taxations to win either publique note, or elſe brutiſh commendations, and ifin this I haue either pre uented or vnwittingly taken in hand that which peraduenture ſome far better Genius may think fit to beſtow vpon ſome of their wel labored howers, let mine inacquaintance, ignorance, and the reaſons before repeated be mine excuſes, & let thē follow on their learned determinations, with this encouragement, that mine as a foile hath no ambition, but to giue luſture to their more pure Diamondes.

                  There griefe begets as long a wearie day,
                  
                     The marchants loſſe makes loathſome his delight,
                  And pouerty deſpiſed breedeth ſpight:
                  Toile makes the Plowmans ſorrowes to ſurmount,

                  The ſingle life is chainde to forraine paines,
                  Yet marriage of more greater cares complaines,

                  To euery age there doth one care belong,
                  And no man likes the life he leadeth long,
                  The ſucking babe wants ſence of good or ill,
                  And children take inſtruction gainſt their will:
