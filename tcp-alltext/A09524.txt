            To the VVor. and Curteous Gentleman M. Richard Hadersham, H. P. wisheth increase of VVorship▪ and virtue.
            
               I Haue (VVorshipfull & wise) contrary to the expectatiō of many, presumed to publish the formall maner of my priuate sorowes, for the great losse of your late deceased Lady-Mistres, & Englands Soueraigne. And knowing your wor. a sad and pensiue mourner for so great a losse, I haue made bold to shrowd my teares vnder your sad garment, which if you deigne to shadowe from the heate of enuie, there is no fire of malice can haue power to partch them. Shrowd them at your pleasure, keepe them no longer then you please to mourne, which I knowe will be of long continuance; not that you haue cause by this late chāge, but that the memorial of so sweet a Princes can not be sodainly buried in obliuion. God graunt that the auncient saying in this barter may be verified, which is, we haue changed for the better. Is it possible a better then Shee should succeed? but what is impossible with the Almightie? VVhat Eliza was in

her life, you know, nay the world knowes her fame girdles in the earth: what her successor hath been in his Kingdom of Scotland, his subiects they know, and we haue heard, which hath been much to Gods glory, his countries peace and his Maiesties honour; Therefore since it hath pleased God to continue his wonted fauour towards vs in blessing vs his vnworthy seruants, with so gratious a Soueraigne, adding vnto his royall Crowne the highest tytle of Maiestie and earthlie dignitie: Graunt thou most of might (Almightie King) that our dread Soueraign Iames the first of that name of these three vnited Kingdoms, Englād, France & Ireland, and of Scotland the sixt, maye be so directed and gouerned by thy Almightie hand, that he may rule his seuerall Kingdoms in peace to thy glory, raigne in tranquility Nestors yeeres to our comfort, and in the end, dye in thy fauour, to liue againe in glory with his aeterniz'd Sister diuine Eliza. Thus not dreading your kinde acceptance of my loue, I humblie take my leaue.
            
               
                  Your Worships most obsequious: Henry Petowe.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            The Induction.
            
               I That obscure haue wept till eyes be drye,
               Wil teach my pen another while to weep.
               Obdurant hartes that they may mollifye,
               For losse of her that now in peace doth sleep.
               Peace rest with her, but sorowe vvith my pen,
               Till dead Eliza doth reuiue agen.
            
            
               Amongst high sp'rited Paragons of vvit,
               That mount beyond our earthlie pitch to fame,
               Creepes forth my Muse, ye great ones fauour it,
               Take her not vp, alas she is too tame.
               Sheel come to hand if you but lure her to you,
               then vse her kindly, for shele kindly woe you.
            
            
               And if this Infant of mine art-lesse braine,
               passe with your sweet aplause as some haue done,
               And, meane good fauour of the learned gaine
               
                  For showring teares vpō 
                  Eliza's tombe.
               my Muse shall hatch such breed whē she's of yeres
               shall bring you cōfort & dry vp your teares.
            
            
               The last of many, yet not the least of all,
               Sing I a heauie dirdge for our late Queene:
               And singing, mourne Eliza's Funerall,
               The Eperse of all that e're haue beene.
               She was, she is, and euermore shall bee,
               the blessed Queene of sweet eternitie.
            
            
               With her in heauen remaines her fame: on earth
               Each moderne Poet that can make a verse
               Writes of Eliza, euen at their Muses birth.
               Then why not I weeepe on Eliza's Herse?
               Som-where in England shall my lines go sleep
               till England read, and (England reading) weepe.
            
         
         
            
            Eliza's Funerall.
            THen withered the Primrose of delight,
            Hanging the head o're Sorowes garden wall:
            When you might see all pleasures shun the light,
            And liue obscuer at Eliza's fall.
            Her fall from life to death, oh stay not there!
            Thogh she were dead, the shriltong'd trump of heauen
            Rais'd her againe, think that you see her heere:
            Euen heere, oh where? not heere, shee's hence bereauē
            
            For sweet Eliza in Elizium liues,
            In ioy beyond all thought. Then weepe no more,
            Your sighing weedes put off, for weeping giues
            (Wayling her losse) as seeming to deplore
            Our future toward fortunes, morne not then:
            You cease a while but now you weepe agen.
            
               Why should a soule in passion be deny'd
            To haue true feeling of her essence misse?
            My soule hath lost her selfe now deified,
            I needes must moane her losse, though crownd with blisse
            Then giue me leaue, for I must weepe a while,
            Till sorrowes deludge haue a lower ebbe,
            Let lamentation neuer finde a stile,
            To passe this dale of woe, vntill the webbe
            Appointed for my latest mourning weed
            Be spun and wouen with a heauie hand.
            Then will I cease to weepe, I will indeed,
            And euery beating billowe will withstand.
            T'will not be long before this web be spun,
            Dy'd blacke, worne out and then my teares be done.
            
               Of Aprils month the eight and twentith day▪
            
            M. Sixe hundred three by computation:
            Is the prefixed time for sorowes stay.
            That past: my mourning weedes grow out of fashion.
            Shall I by▪ prayer hasten on the time?
            Faine would I so, because mine eyes are drie,
            What cannot prayers doe for soules diuine,
            Although the bodies be mortaliitie?
            Diuine she is for whome my Muse doth morne,
            Though lately mortall, now she sits on hie,
            Glorious in heauen, thither by Angells borne,
            To liue with them in blisse eternally.
            Then come faire day of ioyfull smiling sorow,
            Since my teares dry, come happie day to morow.
            
               Yee Herralds of my heart, my heauie groanes,
            My teares which if they could, wold showre like raine
            My heauie lookes and all my surdging mones,
            My moouing lamentations that complayne
            When will you cease, or shall paine, neuer ceasing
            Seaze on my heart? oh mollifie your rage,
            Least your assaults with ouer-swift increasing,
            Procure my death, or call on tymeles age.
            She liues in peace whome I do morne for so,
            She liues in heauen, and yet my soule laments.
            Since shee's so happie, Ile conuert my woe
            To present ioy, turne all my languishments.
            And with my sorrowes see the time doth wast,
            The day is come, and mid-day welnigh past.
            
               Gaze greedy eye: note what thou dost he holde,
            Our horizon is of a perfect hew,
            As cleere as christall, and the day not olde.
            Yet thousand blackes present them to thy view.
            Three thousand and od hundred clowds appere,
            Vpon the earthly Elament belowe
            As blacke as night, trampling the lower Sphere,
            As by degrees from place to place they goe.
            They passe away, oh whether passe they then?
            Into a further clymat out of sight,
            Like clowds they were, but yet like clowded men,
            Whose presence turn'd the day to sable night.
            They vanish thence, note what was after seene,
            The liuely picture of a late dead Queene.
            
               Who like to Phoebus in his golden Car,
            Was the bright eye of the obscured day▪
            
            And though her glorious prograce was not far,
            Yet like the smiling Sunne this semblance lay.
            Drawne in a Ietty Charriot vayl'd with blacke,
            By foure faire Palfraies that did hang the head,
            As if their Lady-Mistris they did lacke,
            And they but drew the figure of the dead.
            Oh yee spectators which did view that sight!
            Say if you truelie say, could you refraine,
            To, shed a 
                  〈◊〉
                of teares in deathes despight,
            That rest her hence, whome art brought backe againe
                  •
                Queene
            He that knew her and had Eliza seene,
            Would sweare that figure were faire Englands
            
               Faire Englands Queene, euen to the life thogh dead,
            Speake if I write not true, did you not crye?
            Cry foorth amaine and say, her Princely head
            Lay on a pillowe of a crimson dye,
            Like a sweet beauty in a harmlesse slumber:
            She is not dead, no sure it cannot be,
            Thus with vnlikely hopes, the vulger number
            Flatter themselues (oh sweet lyu'd flatterie.)
            Indeed a man of iudgement would haue thought,
            Had he not knowne her dead (but seene her so,
            Tryumphant drawne in robes so richly wrought,
            Crowne on her head, in hand her Scepter to)
            At this rare sight he would haue sworne and said,
            To Parliament rides this sweet slumbring Maide.
            
               But that my warrant's seald by truthes one hand,
            That in her counterfeit Art did excell:
            I would not say that in this little land,
            
               Pigmalions equall doth admired dwell▪
            
            Enough of that, and now my teares are done,
            Since she that dy'd liues now aboue the Spheres,
            
               Luna's extinct, and now beholde the Sunne,
            Whose beames soake vp the moysture of all teares.
            A Phoenix from her ashes doth arise,
            A King at whose faire Crowne all glory amyes.
            God graunt his royall vertues simpathize,
            Which late Eliza's, so God saue King Iames.
            
            He that in loue to this saies not Amen,
            Pray God the villaine neuer speake agen. Amen.
