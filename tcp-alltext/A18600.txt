TEARES,
For the loſſe of Prince HENRY. IN A SERMON PREACHED
in the Citie of Briſtol December
7. 1612. being the day of
his Funerall.
            By E. C. Batchelar in Diuinitie, and
publike Preacher to that Citie.
            
               2. Chron. 35. 25.
               And Ieremiah lamented
Ioſiah, and all Singing men and Singing women
mourned for Ioſiah in their Lamentations
to this day, and made the ſame for an ordinance
vnto Iſrael: and behold they are written in the
LAMENTATIONS.
               
            
            AT LONDON,
Printed by W. H. for William Welby, and
are to be ſold at his ſhop in Pauls
Church yard at the ſigne of
the Swanne.
         
         
            
            
            TO THE HIGH
AND MIGHTY PRINCES;
The moſt illuſtrious and hopefull
Prince CHARLES, Duke of Yorke;
the moſt renowned and vertuous Princeſſe
the Lady ELIZABETH her
Grace; together with her eſpouſed
happy Husband, the thrice-noble
and worthy Prince FREDERIKE,
Count Palatine of
Rheine, and Prince
Elector.
            
               TO whom, vnder
God, ſhould theſe
vowed teares humbly
addreſſe themſelues?
but vnto
you three (thrice excellēt Princes)
               
the neereſt partakers, and
moſt hopefull repairers of the
great and common loſſe that
cauſed them.
            A loſſe indeed, common to
vs the members of this State
and Church, with all the faithfull
inhabitants of the Chriſtian
world: But to expreſſe the
greatneſſe of it, What ſhall wee
take to witneſſe for it? what ſhall
wee compare to it?
               Lamen. 2. 13 
               Whereto ſhall
wee liken it? A breach great like
the ſea: who can heale it? who can
comfort vs in it?
            But bleſſed bee the Father of
mercies, and God of all comfort,
that hath not onely preſerued
vnto vs of this age, the royall

               root and ſtemme: but alſo in you
the princely branches, reſerued
a treaſury of hope & comfort
for the generations enſuing.
            Only, being taught by ſo
heauy an hand,Ierem. 3 23 that the hope of
the hils, and multitude of mountaines
is but vaine, except the
Lord be ſought vnto as the only
health of Iſrael. What ſhall we
ſay? but the Lord giue vs hearts
ſo to repay vnto your Excellencies,
the arrerages of praiers
and thanks, wherein wee are
behind hand to your Princely
Brother; that God may be pleaſed
to repaire by you, the loſſe
that in him we haue ſuſtained.
            So may wee hope, that the

God of mercy the ſtrength of
Iſrael will anſwer vs with words
of peace and truth,
               Eſter 9. 30 ſaying:
            
               Vnto our Soueraigne your
royal father,

one that is mighty: I haue exalted
one choſen out of the people, &c.
            
               Vnto you illuſtrious Prince
Charles,2. Sam. 23. 3 Thou ſbalt beare rule
ouer men, being iuſt and ruling in
the feare of God.
            
               Vnto you gracious Lady, I
will bleſſe thee,Gen. 17. 16 and thou ſhalt bee
the mother of Nations, Kings alſo
of people ſhall come of thee.
            Finally, vnto you happie
Prince, and ſent of God to increaſe
our happineſſe, Come in
thou bleſſed of the Lord,
               Gen. 24. 31 for whom

the choiſeſt pearle in the Chriſtian
world is by God himſelf

               The Lord make her

two builded the houſe of Iſrael.
Let her grow into thouſand thouſands,
               Gen. 24. 60
               and let her ſeed poſſeſſe the
gate of his Enemies.
            
            What remaineth, moſt gracious
Princes? but that, with
humble ſuite, for pardon of
this boldnes, and acceptance
of this poore ſeruice, offred
(in the name of this famous
and loiall Citie) vnto the honorable
memory of your triumphant
Brother, and patronage
of your Princely Graces:
I tender vnto your Highneſſes
               
two requeſts, of an heart zealouſly
deuoted, both to your
preſent honour, and euerlaſting
bliſſe.
            The firſt, that you would alwaies
ſet before your eies, the
Princely patterne of vertue
and pietie, ſo happily expreſſed
in the example of that bleſſod
Soule, whom the world was
no longer worthy to enioy: who
beginning as Ioſiah did,2. Chro. 34. 3. from
his tender yeeres, to ſeeke after
the God of his fathers, hath now
left a ſweet (though mournefull)
memory, of his graces amongſt
vs,(Ecclus 49. 1) 
               like the compoſition
of the perfume made by the art of
the Apothecary.
            
            
               
               The ſecond, that you would
often and ſeriouſly meditate
vpon that hoauenly counſel,
giuen by the holieſt King that
euer raigned, that man after
Gods own heart, vnto his ſonne
the wiſeſt Prince that euer liued;
and therefore well be fitting
your graces Greatneſſe:
And thou Solomon,
               1. Chro. 28. 9 my ſonne,
know thou the God of thy Father,
& ſerue him with a perfect heart,
and with a willing mind: for the
Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and
vnderſtandeth all the imaginations
of thoughts: if thou ſeeke
him, he will be found of thee, but if
thou forſake him, he will caſt thee
off for euer.
            
               
Which, if your Graces ſhall
pleaſe to apply, as ſpoken by
God himſelfe to each of you,
I haue all which my ſoule
herein affecteth; which ſhall
neuer ceaſe to call vpon the
Lord for the continuance of
the ſure mercies of Dauid, vpon
our dread Soueraigne with our
gracious Queene your roiall
Parents, and vpon your excellent
Highneſſes, that you
may long remaine the comfort
of their roial Maieſties, and
crowne of vs their well affected
ſubiects.
            
               Your excellent Graces
in all Chriſtian ſeruice,
moſt humbly deuoted,
EDVVARD CHETVVIND.
            
         
         
            
            ¶To the Chriſtian
Reader.
            
               IT was an old complaint
vttered by a Prophet,
Thou haſte ſmitten
them,
               Ierem. 5. 3. 
               but they haue
not lorrowed: would to God it were
not verified in vs, or that wee had learned,
to liſten to that other Prophets
counſell,Mica. 6. 9. 
               Heare yee the rod, and who
hath appointed it.
            
            Then, might our endeauour for reuiuing
ſorrow, ſeeme at this preſent
needleſſe and impertinent; were our
hearts wrought to awfull feare at the
lions roaring, and not rather hardned
as the Adamant ſtone, againſt both
the voice and rod of the Almightie.
            
               
               But as on the one ſide, the terrours
of the Lord inforce; ſo on the other
ſide, the loue of Chriſt and of his
Church, conſtraineth vs to be inſtant
in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, vpon this
ſecure and ſenceleſſe generation.
               Amos 3. 8. The
Lord hath ſpoken; who can but
prophecie? yea the Lord hath begun
to ſtrike, who when hee beginneth,
will make an end,1. Sam 3. 12. 
               and bring forth
iudgement vnto victory; whoſe
eares can now but tingle? or whoſe
heart but tremble?
            This may bee defence inough for a
man, otherwiſe well pleaſed to liue amongſt
his owne people,
               2 King. 4. 13. to put the
trumpet to his mouth, & (if it may be)
to awaken ſuch as ſleepe ſecure in
Sion, of whom it cannot now bee ſaid,
becauſe they haue no changes,
               Pſal. 55. 19.
               therefore they feare not God: but
rather, as of the deſperate Iewes, in
vaine, ſaith God, haue I ſmitten
your children,
               Ierem. 2. 30. 
               they haue receiued
no correction.
            
            
               
To ſpeake plainely, an heauie ſtroake
of Gods hand is now vpon vs for our
ſinnes: but that which giueth cauſe to
feare, that the ſame hand is ſtretched
out ſtill, is, that to our many other ſins,
we adde this aboue all, not to take to
heart ſo grieuous a viſitation.
            A maine proppe and limme is rent
from the body of this Church and ſtate:
who conſidereth it? Our ſinnes haue
vndoubtedly brought this maime vpon
vs: who, finding the plague in his
owne heart acknowledgeth it? that
which the Lord ſeeketh at our hands,
is, that we come downe, and humble
our ſelues at his footſtoole: who goeth
about it? The only remedy of our woūd,
is our true repentance and conuerſion
to him that hath ſmitten vs: how few
that mind it?
            To reduce to feeling our benummed
hearts, God alone is able: but to ſhew
the only good and right way, I haue
endeauoured, as by preaching at firſt to
thoſe that heard it, ſo now by writing

to ſo many as God ſhal direct to read it.
The Lord grant, that the wofull effect,
may addreſſe vs to the wo-worthy
cauſe, and both of them to the ſowre,
but ſoueraigne medicine of repentance
not to be repented of.
            
            
               ISAI. 57. 1
               The righteous periſheth, and no
man conſidereth it in heart: and mercifull
men are taken away, and no man
vnderſtandeth that the righteous is taken
away from the cuill to come.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            VOTIVAE LACHRIMAE
A VOVVE
OF TEARES,
For the loſſe of
Prince HENRY.
            
               LAMENTAT. 5. verſ. 15. 16.
               
                  The ioy of our heart is gone: our dance
is turned into mourning. 
                  The crowne of our head is fallen: woe
now vnto vs that we haue ſinned.
               
            
            
               What was, vowed in ſecret
before the Lord,
in the day when firſt
ill tydings, as a winged:
meſſenger, came
with the ſharpe ſword

of ſorrow, to pearce through our
ſoules [The publike bewailing, namely
of our ſo great and generall Loſſe] that,
now at length through Gods ouer-ruling
prouidence, in the moſt fitting
oportunity, are we mette in this holy
and great aſſembly, purpoſely gathered,
on this day of ſolemne ſorrow, religiouſly
to performe.
            And for this purpoſe, to mooue
our hearts, (otherwiſe inclinable
inough to follow the faſhion of the
Court,) to ioine at this time in this
occaſion of publike ſorrow: behold,
what choiſe it pleaſed God, at that
very firſt, to ſuggeſt vnto mine heart,
that, and none other, make I bold to
offer.
            A text indeed befitting, as I conceiue
it, if any other, this mournefull
accident, and which I doubt not but
you alſo, Fathers and Brethren, all
heere preſent, will ſo eſteeme; ſhall
ye not onely marke the wordes, like
to Ezekiels role,
               Ezek. 2. 10. all full of Lamentations,
Mourning, and Woe: but withall,
take notice of the ſpeciall cauſe moouing
that holy Prophet Ieremy (a man

liuing if euer any of the Prophets, in
times of miſery) ſo to complaine.
            For howſoeuer it be manifeſt, that
in this booke hee more generally lamenteth
the diſtreſſed ſtate of the
Church of God, the ouerthrow of the
City Ieruſalem, and burning of the
Temple, the ſpoile and ſlauery of the
whole nation; al which he liued to behold:
yet that this his ſo bitter wailing
was in part at leaſt, and that a chiefe
part, for the death of that Prince of ſo
great proofe and hopes, Ioſiah; witnes
what is recorded.verſe 25. 2. Chron. 35. And
Ieremiah lamented Ioſiah, and all ſinging
men and ſinging women mourned for
Ioſiah, in their Lamentations, to this
day, and made the ſame for an ordinance
vnto Iſrael, and behold they are written
in the Lamentations: that is, in this
booke;
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                which howſoeuer in the Hebrew
original, it be without any name,
ſaue onely that it is ſtiled, by the firſt
word of the booke (as are alſo the 5.
Bookes of Moſes) yet is it in the Hebrew
Cōmentaries, as Ierome noteth,
ſo called, and accordingly by the 70.
Interpreters;
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               Lamentations. The

Lamentations of Ieremy.
            
            Wherein, as it is generally agreed,
that hee expreſly mourneth for King
Ioſiahs loſſe, (that being the beginning
and preſage of all their enſuing
ſorrowes) the beſt Expoſitors hereto
referring, that complaint, Chap. 4. 20.
The breath of our noſtrels, the annointed
of the Lord, was taken: of whom we ſaid,
vnder his ſhaddow we ſhall bee preſerued
aliue, among the heathen. So, in more
particular, touching the very words
of my text, I ſee not, why wee ſhould
not take them alſo, as a part of the Lamentation,
if not wholly, yet chiefely,
for that loſſe; the phraſe of the falling
downe of the Crowne, ſo rightly fitting.
            Since, howſoeuer I am not ignorant,
that ſome Interpreters vnderſtand
to bee meant heereby, the defacing
and decay of the Temple, and ſeruice
of God, with other things wherein
that people gloried, as in their
crowne; and others, as if hereby were
ſignified onely, that the garlands, and
other ornaments of delight, vſed in
their nuptials, and other times of ioy,

were now laid aſide; as if the Prophets
purpoſe were hereby only to expreſſe
their wailing and wofull ſtate: yet is
there no interpretation that can bee
giuen, comming neerer to the nature
of the Metaphor heere vſed, then to
vnderſtand it of that, which hee had
before vnder other termes lamented,
the fall of their Soueraigne Prince
wearing the Diademe; according as
of the ſetting vp of ſuch an one, is
elſe where ſpoken in the like phraſe:Pſal. 21. 3.
               Thou didſt preuent him with liberall bleſſings,
and didſt ſet a crowne of pure gold
vpon his head.
            
            Againſt which Expoſition if any ſhal
except, that heere the Prophet ſpeaketh
of the fall, not of the Kings
crowne, but of the peoples rather;
The Crowne of our head is falne; which
may ſeeme more generally to ſignifie,
the decay and fall of all their honour,
wealth, and beauty, all the glory
of both their Church and Commonwealth:
wee will not ſticke to grant
that more generall extent, ſo this particular
of the Princes fall bee therein
eſpecially conceiued; As it needes

muſt bee,Prou. 14. 28. ſince as the wiſe Salomon
hath told vs, that in the multitude of
the people is the honour of a King:
ſo is it certaine on the other ſide,
that the peoples crowne and honour
is in their Prince or King, eſpecially
if a good Prince, ſuch as Ioſiah
was.
            For the ſal of whom therefore, how
well might they lament, as for the falling
downe of their crowne vnto the
ground, crying out, as heere, in bitter
griefe, The crowne of our head is fallen:
eſpecially, ſince this fall of the Prince
did preſage (if they did not with ſpeed
preuent it) Gods farther iudgement
vpon the people, whoſe ſinnes had
doubtleſſe prouoked him thus farre
already: as therefore the humbled
Prophet in their name acknowledgeth
with a prefixed note of ſorrow in the
laſt words, Woe now vnto vs that wee
haue ſinned.
            
            Vpon which ſubordinate cauſes of
ſinne and iudgement, depend thoſe
two conſequents mentioned in the
former verſe; Firſt the inward ſorrow
affecting their hearts whereof hee

complaineth,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                
               The ioy of our heart is
gone, or [ceaſed.]
            Secondly, their Lamentation or
humiliation outwardly expreſſing
that inward ſorrow, and vſed for remedy
to preuent farther iudgements,
which hee thus Emphatically expreſſeth,
Our daunce is turned into Mourning.
            
            And in this order, obſeruing firſt
the cauſes, and then the conſequents;
The meaning of the whole
complaint being a part of the Prophets
praier in the behalfe of the
Church afflicted, and by affliction
now humbled, what is it in effect and
ſumme, but this briefly, That alaſſe!
now they ſee by lamētable proofe,
by the fall of their Crowne, the
taking away of their Prince, that
they haue by ſinning procured their
own woe, and moued God to wrath
and indignation againſt them: and
therefore how can it be but that their
ioy ſhould bee quite gone,
and inſteede thereof bitter griefe
poſſeſſe their ſoules; yea therefore
high time for them to exile and put away

their mirth and dauncings, and
on the contrary betake themſelues
with ſpeed to mourning and repentant
praier, thereby to stay Gods anger,
and ſo to keepe off from their
heads all farther euill.
            
            And this being, ſo farre as I can
reach, the true ſence and ſubſtance of
theſe words; wee ſee, not onely the
ſorrowfull eſtate of thoſe diſtreſſed
people therein expreſſed, but alſo our
owne preſent condition plainely exemplified,
and our ſolues for an holy
vſe thereof directed, to a ſourefold
conſideration. Firſt, what hath been
our loſſe: Secondly, what we may reckon
the cauſe of this loſſe: Thirdly,
how we ſhould bee affected with this
loſſe: Fourthly and finally, how wee
may beſt preuent all farther loſſe. The
firſt and ſecond are offered from verſe
16. for, the crawne of our head is falne,
there is our loſſe; and, Woe vnto vs
that we haue ſinned, that is the cauſe.
To the other two we are pointed var.
15. The ioy of our heart is gone, thus
ſhould we be heere with affected: yea
farther, Our daunce is turned in to nigurning,
               
loe this the meanes to haue all
feares for the future preuented. Of
which therefore in order, beginning
with the conſideration of our loſſe,
from the firſt branch of the latter verſ.
The Crowne of our head is fallen.
            
            What the ſpeciall crowne of their
heads was, from whom wee borrow
this complaint, you haue already
heard, to wit, their worthy and good
King Ioſiah; and whoſe death no maruell
if they reckoned none other, then
the falling of their Crowne downe
from their head, the loſſe and ſpoile to
them of all their glory, with preſage
of farther woe and enſuing miſery.
            But what? is our Crowne (to make
application) ſo fallen from our heades
vnto the ground? Oh, God forbid;
No, bleſſed be the God of Iaacob, the
royall Crowne, and Diademe Imperiall,
ſet by God vpon our heads, it ſtill
remaineth flowriſhing, Great Britains
glory. And long, and long, ſo may
our Hezekiah liue and raigne, and
wretched, thrice wretched may they
be, that euer ſo much as wiſh in heart,
to ſee his fall.
            
               
But it is the Princely Coronet of
hope and future expectation, onely
looked on, and with the luſtre daze
ling our ſight, that we haue loſt; our
good Ioſiah, herein onely differing, in
that before we needed to haue him ſet
as a crowne vpon our head, it hath
pleaſed his God and ours, to take
him hence, to crowne him with an
euerlaſting diademe in heauen. Howbeit
though hee haue thereby gained
rather, yet wee haue loſt, alas, farre
more then euer we enioied, except in
hopes, and downe our crowne is fallen,
as well wee may complaine with
mournefull hearts, before that euer
by Gods hand it was faſtned on our
heads.
            Our Crowne, our Diademe. Oh,
why ſhould wee not ſo reckon him?
who was not onely borne a Prince,
but created alſo our Prince, and acknowledged
to the world by his roiall
Father, long agone (as the beginning of
his might,
               Gen 49. 3. 
               the excellencie of dignitie, and
the excellency of power) to be his deareſt
ſonne,
               
                  Baſilic dor. in epiſtola nuncupstor. 
               and naturall ſucceſſour; the rightfull
heire to the imperiall crowne and

diademe of all his kingdomes. In
whoſe vntimely loſſe (as we may count
it, but that God the king of Kings,
who reſerueth times to his owne prerogatiue,
was pleaſed ſo to order it) behold,
what wee haue ſuffered, all the
true ſubiects of this Realme, the fall of
our very Crowne; our ſecond diademe
now in preſent, and chiefeſt in future
hope: a loſſe inualuable nor of a Prince
onely, but of ſuch a Prince, adorned
with ſo rich graces, in tender yeeres
yeelding ſuch hopes; that (excepting
onely that paragon of, otherwiſe
matchleſſe, price, Edward the ſixth) I
preſume wee may without wrong to
any ſpeak it, neuer yet had this Realme
euery way the like.
            Touching whom, if any yet ſhall
doubt, whether we haue reaſon to reckon
him ſo, as to eſteeme his loſſe the
downe-falling of our Crowne: let vs
for proofe firſt conſider, whether hee
were not as the people ſometimes
ſpake of Dauid,
               2. Sam. 18. 3 
               worth ten thouſand of
vs. Surely if but in regard of his blood
and place, which made vs in reaſon to
conceiue of him, as of an Izhak, an

heire of promiſe, in whome we hoped
for a bleſſing: or as of a Noah borne
in an happy houre to be our comfort;
on whome, howſoeuer not for the preſent,
yet for the hopes of future generations,
was ſet, as Samuel ſometimes
ſpake,1. Sam. 9. 20. 
               all the deſire of Iſrael, as on a riſing
ſunne, hoped to be hereafter, what
Dauid is intituled,2. Sam. 21. 17. 
               The light of Iſrael.
            
            Neither was this the hope of vs
ſubiects onely, but the endeauour and
expectation alſo of his Royall Father,
whoſe Princely care (no way better
approued to God and his Church) for
the welfare of more then one generation;
as it made him more then a Kenophon,
               In Cyro. paed.
euen a Dauid, labouring the
religious inſtitution of this Solomon,
both by his owne treaſury of Kingly
counſels,In Baſilic. dor. and the emploiment for that
ſeruice of men of cheefeſt ability and
truſt: ſo would it no doubt haue been
fully ſatiſfied, had God ſo pleaſed,
that hee might haue left the fruit of
theſe hopefull ſeedes, as a ioifull harueſt
to bee reaped by the enſuing
ages.
            
               
For our parts, we ſaw the blooming,
and reioiced in the ſweet ſent of this
goodly growing plant; yea not wee
onely, but Strangers alſo were ſo affected
with the fragrant odour of the
ſame, that it was doubtfull, whether
our hope in him, or their admiration
of him, were the greater. They, like to
Hiram, ſuch as did but heare of him,
with reioicing bleſſed God for him,1. King. 5. 7. as
for a Wiſe ſonne, appointed to ſucceed
his victorious father ouer this mighty
nation: and how much more with the
Queene of Sheba,
               2. Chron. 9. 3. ſuch as came to behold
and ſee his religious cariage in
the worſhip of God, both in publike
and priuate; his prudent care for the
well ordering of his Court, and that
rare temper of magnificence and frugality,
in the managing of his Princely
eſtate.
            But as for vs, whome the hopefull
appearances of his piety and vertue
did more neerely and properly concerne,
how could we, as many as are
true hearted to the Religion and ſtate;
but ſeriouſly reioice, to foreſee an
Engliſh Ioſiah, beginning in his tender

yeeres to ſeeke after the God of his
Fathers?
               2. Chro. 34. 3. Inſomuch that now, looking
backe to that hope we had too confidently
embraced, we may euen ſeeme
to ſpeake (borrowing to an inferiour
ſence that phraſe of the two Diſciples
trauailing to Emaus) but wee truſted,
               Luke 24 21.
               that it had beene hee, that ſhould haue
deliuered Iſrael.
            
            
               One, who we hoped, and wiſhed,
as Dauid in his praier for Solomon,Pſal. 72. 6
might come downe like the raine vpon
the mowen graſſe,verſ. 7. and as the ſhowers
that water the earth: in whoſe daies the
righteous ſhould flouriſh and aboundance
of peace be happily eſtabliſhed:
of whom, we promiſed our ſelues, that
he ſhould be Iſaiahs good King,
               Iſai. 32. 2. reigning
in iuſtice, and ruling in iudgement,
as an hiding place from the winde, and as
a refuge for the tempeſt, as riuers of water
in a drie place, and as the ſhadow of a
great Rocke in a weary land: finally,
one of whom wee hoped (what the
Aduerſary more then feared) that,
treading in the ſteps of his religious
Father, our preſent gratious Soueraigne,
and going on where he ſhould

leaue (as Ioſhuah after Moſes in ſubduing
of the Canaanites) he would Ioſiah
like compell all that were found in Iſrael
to ſerue the Lord.2. Chro. 34. 33
            
            Behold, beloued, theſe, and many
more not mentioned, the conceiued
hopes that we had in him, who was
expected in the ſucceeding age, not
without iuſt reaſon, to become our
Crowne. The vnexpected loſſe of
whom ſo ſuddenly (Oh that wee
ſhould need ſo lamentable a document;
to make vs giue care to the
Pſalmiſts counſell,Pſal. 146. 3. 
               Not to put truſt in
Princes &c.) Alas! how hath it caſt vs
downe from the hopes, which in him
we conceiued, and forcibly brought
vs to acknowledge, as in our text, The
crowne of our head to be fallen?
            Surely not a great man onely in
Iſrael,
               2. Sam. 3. 38. as Dauid ſometimes ſpake of
Abner, but the very crowne and glorie
of our Iſrael; who, howſoeuer hee be
taken away in Gods great mercy and
loue to him (no doubt,) as Enoch, of
whom is chronicled,Gen. 5. 24. that hee walked
with God, and was no more ſeene; for
God tooke him away; or as Ioſiah, to

Whom was promiſed as a ſpeciall fauour
from the Lord, that he ſhould
be: gathered to his fathers, and be put
into the graue in peace,
               2. Chro. 34. 28 
               that his eies
might not ſee the euils, which God purpoſed
to bring vpon that place and
people: yet for ourſelues, well may
wee dread, leſt this his taking away,
hath beene in Gods diſpleaſure rather
towards vs, who were neither worthy
of, nor yet truly thankfull for, ſuch and
ſo great a bleſſing.
            Whom therefore God, according
to that threat in Ezelkiel, of taking
away the Diademe and the Crowne,
               Ezek. 21. 26.
hath taken away from vs; by the loſſe
and miſſe, to bring vs to conceiue
more rightly of the worth of ſuch a
gift. The Lord grant wee may take
it to heart, to make a right vſe of it.
Since for the cauſe procuring (ſo farre
as it concerneth ourſelues) alas! what
may we reckon it, but our ſinnes deſeruing
iuſtly ſo great, yea a greater
iudgèment? as in deteſtation of our
ſelues therefore, wee truely may, and
wil redily, if once throughly humbled,
acknowledge in our Prophets wailing

words, Woe vnto vs that wee haue
ſinned. Since if wee alſo ſhall more
queſtion of the cauſe, or ſay in our
heart, wherefore are theſe things thus
come vpon vs? leremy our Prophet hath
long agone made vs heereto anſwere,
Ierem. 13. 22. For the multitude of thine
iniquities, are thy skirts diſcouered, and
thy heeles made bare.
            
            For ſurely ſo, as it is generally ſin,
that brings ſhame and iudgement vpon
any people, as on the old world,
on Sodome, and the Canaanites, &c. to
the very rooting out of them from the
earth: ſo more particularly and for the
purpoſe, that it is for the peoples ſins
that princes are taken away, witneſſe
that teſtimony, Prou. 28. 2. For the
tranſgreſſion of a land there are many
Princes thereof; often changes of the
Crowne, being euermore dangerous
to a Common-weale; as wee may ſee
for inſtance. 1. King. 16. In the diſioynted
ſtate of Iſrael.
            
            Yea farther, not to vrge many
proofes to this purpoſe, looke but in
Iſaiah 3. How as a maine iudgement,Verſe 1.
the Lord of Hoſtes threatneth to take

away from Ieruſalem and Iudah,
               Verſ. 2 
               the
ſtay and ſtrength, the ſtrong man, and
the man of Warre, the Ruler, and the
Prophet, the Prudent, and the Aged.
Appointing children to be their Princes,
               verſ. 4
               and babes to rule ouer them. But what
may be imagined the cauſe of all this
ruine? It followeth after, Doubtleſſe
leruſalem is fallen,
               verſe. 3. 
               and Iudah is fallen
downe; becauſe their tongues and works
are againſt the Lord, to prouoke the eies
of his glory. Yea the triall of their countenance
teſtiſieth againſt them,
               verſ. 9. 
               they declare
their ſinnes as Sodome, they hide
them not; and therefore, Woe now vnto
their ſoules, for they haue rewarded
euill vnto themſelues,
               ver. 14. 16. And hee inſtanceth
after in the end of the Chapter, in
two chiefe euils, the tyrannous oppreſſion
of their gouernours, and their
womens want onneſſe and pride. The
fruit of which and all the reſt, redounding
to the ruine and ſubuerſion of the
ſtate, wee may read concluded in the
laſt verſe.verſe 26. Therefore ſhall her gares
lament, and mourne, and ſhee being deſolate
ſhall ſit vpon the ground.
            
            To bring no more for confirmation

of this generall truth, that it is the ſin
of the people that mooueth God to
take away their Princes; a thing which
both Nehemiah and Daniel, and here
and elſewhere our Ieremy, and all the
faithfull in ſuch caſes truly humbled
haue acknowledged: haue not wee
reaſon in this caſe to ſuſpect our
ſelues, yea to conclude that for our
ſinnes, God Almighty in his diſpleaſure,
hath ſent this loſſe of loſſes, and
made this breach vpon vs?
            It may be (to make coniecture) for
our great vnthankefulneſſe; in that
God hauing affoorded vs heretofore
many great and maruellous, if not
miraculous, Deliuerances; as to name
but two moſt memorable, from the
inuaſion of our profeſſed enemies, and
their inuincible Armado in 88; and
ſince from that helliſh deſigne (worthy
a laſting monument for deteſtation)
of the Popiſh pioners: wee haue
not rendred according to the reward beſtowed
on vs,
               2. Chr. 32. 25. 
               but haue had our hearts
lift vp: for which therefore wee may
iuſtly feare, that this wrath is come vpon
vs.
            
            
               
Or may it not be, for yet a farther
degree of foule ingratitude, that hauing
beene bleſſed by God, as much
as euer any Nation, with aboundance
of long peace in a fruitfull Countrey,
wee haue giuen him cauſe to complaine
of vs, as in that ſong of Moſes
Deut 32.Verſe 15. againſt his people, that we
that ſhould haue beene vpright, when we
waxed fat haue ſpurned with the heele;
yea being fatte and groſſe and laden
with fatneſſe, haue either quite forſaken
God that made vs, or not as wee
ſhould regarded the ſtrong God of our
ſaluation,
               Verſe 16. 
               but haue prouoked him to anger,
if not with ſtrange Gods, yet certainclie,
with many foule abominations
and crying ſinnes? So that as
the widowe of Sarephath, when ſhee
ſaw her childe breathleſſe, cried out in
a paſſion vnto Elijab 1. King.
               Verſe 16. 17: O
thou man of God, art thou come to mee,
to call my ſinne to remembrance, and to
ſtay my ſonne? So may wee acknowledge,
with humiliation vnder his
hand, that God is come vnto vs, to
call our ſinnes vnto remembrance,
and therefore hath taken away our

Prince. And whether farther yet, his
purpoſe be to proceede againſt vs, except
by ſpeedy turning from ſinne we
ſtay his hand, wee haue cauſe to
feare.
            But ſurely by this already done, the
Lord God hath more then manifeſted,
that his are vpon vs, (as of
old he threatned Iſrael) as vpon a ſinful
kingdome,
               Amos 9. 8. with whom he hath already
entred action,Leuit. 26 25. as meaning to auenge
the quarel of his couenant: and to maintain
his controuerſie againſt vs; the ſame
verily and none other,Hoſea 4. 1. which in Hoſea
he proſeſſed to haue with the inhabitants
of the Land of Iſrael, viz. for the
crying ſinnes of our Land prouoking
the eies of his glory.
            For howſoeuer by the mercy of
God, we haue wherewith to ſtop the
mouth of the blaſphemous Aduerſary,
both in regard of our profeſſion after
the way which they cal Hereſie,
               Acts 24. 14. 
               worſhipping
the God of our Fathers, beleeuing
all things which are written in the Law
and in the Prophets; and in regard of
practiſe,Rom. 6. 17. not being deſtitute of thoſe,
who from the heart haue obeyed vnto

the forme of Doctrine, whereunto they
haue beene deliuered: yet ſo few in
compariſon are they that ioine theſe
two together, or willingly brooke
the Narrow way to life,
               The ſtrait gate &c. vpon Luk 13 13. 24 (as hath beene
ſhewed in the treatiſe formerly written
touching that Argument,) that
vpon the body of our profeſſors may
iuſtly light that exprobration of the
Propher Ieremy,
               Ierem. 7. 8 viz that they doe but
truſt in lying words when they cry ſo
loud, The Temple of the Lord, The
Temple of the Lord, &c.
            
            For alas ſhow can it ſecure or profit
vs before the Lord, that we haue the vndoubted
marks of a true viſible church,
in ſoundneſſe of Doctrine, and forme
of worſhip, whiles the matter of cortroucrſie
betweene God and vs remaineth,
no truth,
               Hoſca 4. 1. 
               nor mercy, nor found
knowledge of God in the lands No, but inſteed
there of for all the Lords care of
his Vinoyard & our paineful preaching
(and what, then thinke you would be
if the Lord ſhould let fall his care, if
there were no preaching, no planting
of the beſt plants. no plucking vp of
the euill weedes?) A plentifull Vintage

of thoſe wilde and ſowre grapes,
of impiety and vnmercifulneſſe, wherwith
in Eſaies time his teeth were ſet
on edge;Iſai. 5. 4. and which by his Prophet
Hoſea hee caſteth in the teeth of the
wicked Iſraelites,
               Hoſ. 4. 2. who by ſwearing, and
lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and whoring,
are ſaid to breake out and bloud to
touch bloud.
               verſ. 3 And therefore no maruel
if the land mourneth, &c.
            
            And yet behold, we are by the ſame
Prophet immediatly after directed, to
take knowledge of a ſinne of lowder
cry in the Lords eares, then any of the
forementioned, where hee ſaith, yet
let none rebuke nor reprooue another,
               verſe 4 as
if he ſhould ſay, it is but loſt labour,
for thy people are as thoſe that rebuke
the Preiſt.
               Amos 5. 13 
               An euill time indeed when
the prudent ſhall bee aduiſed to keepe
ſilence,
               1. King. 22. 8. becauſe, as Ahab could not away
with Micaiah, ſo, men hate him
that rebuketh in the gate,
               verſe 10 
               and abhorre
him that ſpeaketh vprightly. So euill a
time, that where this ſinne preuaileth
it may bee feared the time of vengeance
is not farre of; as the Lord himſelfe
ſheweth, iuſtifying his ſeuere proceeding

againſt his people in the captiuity
of Babylon,
               2. Chr. 36. 16. becauſe they mocked
his meſſengers, deſpiſed his words, miſuſed
his Prophets, vntill the wrath of
the Lord aroſe againſt his people, and
till there was no remedy,
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                or (as the word
imports) no farther [healing.]
            What ſhal I ſeeke for more particulars?
for thoſe crying ſinnes that pulled
fire from heauen vpon Sodome, euen
thoſe foure Cardinall crimes
which the Prophet Ezekiel: Ezek. 16.
49. expreſly mentioneth, viz. Pride,
Fulneſſe of bread, Abundance of idleneſſe,
Cruelty in not ſtrengthening the hand of
the poore and needy: Oh! that we could
ſay our land were free from them! But
alas, we cannot.
            For firſt, who ſeeth not that Pride,
that ſetteth it ſelfe out to euery eic in
their outward habit, proportionable
neither to the body that weares it, nor
to the eſtate that ſhould maintaine it,
nor to the ſober liking of thoſe that
ſhould approue it? in al which regards,
it falleth vnder the ſame condemnation
with the ſtrange and diſguiſed attire,Iſa. 
                     ••
                  . 
                     •
                  5. Zeph. 1. 3.
by the old Prophets ſo long agoe

ſeuerely cenſured. But there is yet
another Pride, that keepeth it ſelfe
more out of view, ſurking ſecretly in
the heart; yet not ſo ſecretly, but,
either by the trial of the countenance
and geſture, or by words, eſpecially
when there is occaſion of boaſting
and contention, or by port and affecting
of high place; or laſtly by intruding
into Gods office, raſhly paſſing
cenſure vpon anothers ſeruants,
it doth more or leſſe diſcouer it ſelfe
to be that Pride of heart that God abhorreth.
            Secondly for fulneſ of bread, comprehending
not onely gluttonous eating,
but alſo that fowler abuſe, now
a daies, and more vniuerſall deluge of
exceſſiue drinking: are not theſe the
times which our Sauiour ſaid ſhould
paralel the daies of Noah? and we of
this nation the perſons of whom nothing
is to be ſtoried, but that we are
found as it were [at racke and manger]
eating and drinking as if wee had no
other care,Math. 24. 38. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                but to nouriſh our hearts
as in a day of ſlanghter?
               Iam 55. and God
grant it bee not againſt the day of our

owne ſlaughter. So fearefully are wee
ouerſlowne with the inundation
eſpecially of the ſinne of drunkennes,
that it is hardly beleeued that exceſſe
in drinking and quaſſing is a ſinne, in
ſuch as can beare it away or ſtand vpright
with it: although the Prophet
Eſay hath left a ſpecial woe againſt
them that are mighty to drinke wine,
               Iſai 5. 22. 
               and
ſtrong to poure in ſtrong drinke.
               1. Pet. 4. 3. And
Th' appoſtle Peter among the luſts of
the gentiles (of all that truly profeſſe
Chriſt to bee abandoned) reckoneth
euen thoſe [drinkings] and carrowſings;
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
               
the ſhamefull ſinne of our nation.
Oh! if ſome part of thoſe huge
healths, that haue beene heaued vp as
a ſuppoſed honour to our late renowned
Prince, had beene conuerted into
humble and feruent praiers to God
for his preſeruation: we might poſſibly
haue had him now liuing amongſt
vs, and God ſurely leſſe offended
at vs.
            Thirdly, that there is no want among
vs of Aboundant idlenes, witnes
the very liues, that all men looke vpon,
of baſe vagarants; who like thoſe

               afflicted and aſſamiſhed wretches ſpoken
of by the Prophet,Iſai 8. 21. are ſuffered too
much euery where (not for want of
good lawes, but of due execution) to
goe to and fro the countrie, wandring
about in ſwarmes to doe miſchiefe,
and ready when they be hungry to freat
themſelues, and cureſe both their King
and God; whiles they wilfully remaine
in want becauſe their hands refuſe to
worke,
               Prou. 21. 25. hauing nothing but what they
get by ſpoile or beggery from others,
to the ſhame of our chriſtian common
wealth, and contrary to the prouiſion
made by that old ſtatute law in
Moſes;
               Deut. 15. 4. That there ſhould bee no begger
in Iſruel; renewed and confirmed
by Saint Paul as by a latter act of
Parliament vnder the Goſpell, where
he telleth the Theſſalonians,2. Theſ. 3. 10. how he
had warned them here of before, that
if any would not worke being able, hoe
ſhould not eat.
            
            Howbeit, I would to God there
were not others guilty of this Sodomſinne
of Idlenes, that would be accounted
as their place requireth, of farre
better reckoning; yea euen of the

greater ones, the Nobles and gentrie
of our Land, eſpecially yonger brothers,
liuing without any calling careleſly,Amos 6. 1
not a few, who as thoſe in Amos,
againſt whom God denounceth a
fearefull woe,ver. 3 
               liuing at eaſe in Sion, and
therefore putting away farre from
them the euil day,
               ver. 4 doe ſtretch themſelues
on beds of Iuory, eating the lambes of
the flocke, and the Calues out of the ſtall,
ſinging to the ſound of the Ʋioll, &c.
and drinking wine in bowles, no man being
ſorrie for the affliction of Ioſeph. As
if they had beene placed by God on
earth to doe nothing elſe, but what
Leuiathan is made to doe in the ſea,Pſal. 104. 26
euen to play and ſport themſelues; as
thoſe rich ones in Iames,
               Iam. 5. 5 againſt whom
we read that indicement, inough in the
laſt day if there were none other to
condemne them, yee haue liued in pleaſure
vpon the earth.
            
            Fourthly that there is amongſt vs
(notwithſtanding many wholſome
lawes, better then which no kingdome
euer had in that behalfe) cruelty and
miſerable oppreſſion of the poorer
ſort, inſteed of ſtrengthning their hands,
               
practiſed for maintenance of riot and
Idlenes in the rich (for idlenes muſt
haue maintenance from others labors)
as in thoſe idlers in Saint Iames,
               Iam. 5. 4 that
are noted to haue kept backe the Laborers
hire,
               ver 6 and to haue condemned and
killed the righteous, that were not able
to make their partie good againſt
them: let the racking of rents, and raiſing
of fines, turning out of Tenants,
and decay of titlage by incloſures, the
greedines of hard-hearted Vſurers &c.
with the teares of many an oppreſſed
fatherleſſe and widdow, beare witnes;
who if they bee not heard, and their
wrongs redreſſed, God that alwaies
hath an eare open to ſuch complaints,Iſa. 5. 9
will come neere in iudgement, and bee
himſelfe a ſwift witneſſe,
               Mal. 3. 5. againſt ſuch
wrong doers,Col. 3. 25. who ſhall receiue for the
wrong that they haue done, of him with
whom there is no reſpect of perſons.
            
            Adde hereto finally, that luke-warmnes
both in profeſſion and in practiſe,
ouer-ſpreading our Church, ſometimes
reproued in Laodicea,
               Reu. 3. 16. whiles we
conceit but too well of our owne

            All theſe laid now together vpon

what thinke you that wee may iudge

not high time for vs,1. Cor. 11. 31 as the Corinthians
are aduiſed by the Appoſtle, to
iudge our ſelues, that we be not yet farther
iudged of the Lord? yes verily, neither

failing, compaſſions and faithfulneſſe of
the Lord, might wee hope for future
peace or ſafety;2 King. 9. 22. whiles theſe
witchcrafts and whoredomes of that Iezabel
of naturall corruption, are yet in
ſo great number,
               Prou. 30. 20 that if we as the adulterous
woman, ſhould wipe our mouth
and ſay we haue done none iniquity, yet
could the Lord of heauen & earth, euen
the Iudge himſelfe, beare witneſſe and
reproue vs,Amos 5. 1 a ſaying as in Amos, I know
your manifold trāſgreſſions, & your mighty
ſins: To which therefore (to conclude
at length this ſecond point) let vs,
without either blaming ſuppoſed ſecond
cauſes, or accuſing God of too
ſtrict iuſtice in this behalfe, learne in
true humility to referre all our loſſe,
crying as heere our humbled Prophet,
Woe now vnto vs, for we haue ſinned,
and therefore loe the Crowne of our
head fallen. With which fall if yee deſire
to heare how wee ought to bee

               affected, it commeth now to bee conſidered
from the firſt words of the 15.
ver. The ioy of our heart is ceaſed.
            
            For, this being an vndoubted conſequent,
of the feeling apprehenſion
of their preſent calamitie, accompanied
with feare of farther miſerie;
hence (to 
                  〈◊〉
                enlarging) may wee
take direction, how we alſo with our
loſſe ſhould bee affected: how? but
as the holy Virgiue to whom the many
ſorrowes for her bleſſed ſon were
(as old Simcon compared thē) a ſword
that ſhould pearce through her ſoule.
               Luk. 2. 35. A
dangerous wound, and deadly, if not
to the life, yet to the ioy and comfort
of the heart. For verily thoſe hearts
muſt needs bee armed with ſtony, yea
adamantine hardneſſe; which are not
pierced with this ſword of ſorrow:
which melt not,2. Chro. 34. 28 as Ioſiah his heart, at
the apprehenſion of Gods iudgement:
yea which, with Ieremy, wiſh not the
head a ceſterne of water,
               Ierem. 9. 1. 
               and the eies as
fountaines of teures, to weepe day and
night for the fall of their crowne.
            The greateſt cauſe of ſorrow, and
moſt important loſſe, excepting that

one (if that were greater, which was
ſo ſoone and graciouſly by God himſelfe
repaired) of our laſt renowned
Soueraigne Queene Elizabeth, that euer
in our age befell this flouriſhing
ſtate & kingdome: able to make all true
hearted Subiects to weep, til with Dauid
and his followers at Ziklag,
               1. Sam. 30 4 
               we be able
to weepe noe more. If not for him ſomuch,
who was taken from our head to
be tranſlated into bliſſe, yet, as our
Sauiour ſaid to the daughters of Ieruſalem,
               Luk. 23. 28
               for our ſelues and for our children,
who feele all the loſſe.
            Whereat howſoeuer wee haue iuſt
cauſe to grieue, and ſomuch the more
becauſe we may eaſily conceiue how
Gath and Aſhkelon and the vncircumciſed
hollow hearted Philiſtines within
our ſelues,2. Sam. 1. 20 if not happily Moab,
Ammon, and Edom, ſome of our bordering
euill neighbours alſo doe reioice
(to whom wee haue to anſwer with
the Church in Micah,
               Mica. 7. 8. 
               Reioice not againſt
me,
               Lam. 4. 21 
               ô mine enemy, though I fall,
&c. For, may not the cup alſo paſſe

left deſtitute of moſt Princely hopes,

in thoſe royal branches, more thē one,
ſpringing from the ſame bleſſed roots;
and now a third, in lieu of that fallen
off, we truſt by Gods owne hand, for
the increaſe of ſtrength and honour

Match, howſoeuer the il willers to Siō
may maligne it, that hardly could the
Chriſtian world, for purity and parity
of true Religion, in all points fundamentall,
agreeing with our Church
(witneſſe that worthy Palatine Catechiſme,
expounded by learned Vrſinits)
affoard the like.
            That yet we may haue good hope,1. Sam. 4, 21
that Ichabod is not borne,Num, 24, 23 nor the glorie
to depart from Iſrael (for, who ſhall
liue when God doth this?) nor we to be
left,1. King. 22, 17 as Iſrael in Micaiahs viſion ſcattered
vpon the mountaines, as ſheepe
without any Shepheard: vnleſſe as our
vnthankefulneſſe hath already defeated
our firſt hope,Iſa. 9. 12. ſo the want of feeling
of this heauy ſtroake cauſe the
hand of God to bee ſtill ſtretched out
againſt vs,Lam. 3. 65. till, maugre our dulneſſe
and obſtinacie, he haue giuen vs ſorrow

of heart, euen his curſe vpon vs. but,
oh let it thus befall thine enemies and
ours, O Lord! and ſuch as reioice in
our ſorrow, or refuſe to ſorrow with
vs, giue them ſorrow in due time; but
without vs. As for vs, whoſe names
the Almighty hath changed from Naomi
to Marah,
               Ruth 1. 20. teaching vs, not only
by nature to lament the ſorrowfull effect,
but alſo by grace to be humbled
for the ſinnefull cauſe, let vs in the
fourth and laſt place learne how to expreſſe
and teſtifie our repentant ſorrow,
as the meanes to turne away
Gods anger and prcuent our farther
danger, from the practiſe of this holy
Prophet, and people of God, profeſſed
in the laſt words of the 15 verſe,
our dance is turned into mourning.
            
            
               How could they, yea how can wee
better ſuite our ſelues, to the hand and
minde of God, (who calling to mourning,
chargeth men to bee no more
mockers,Iſai 28. 22 leſt their bandes encreaſe)
then when all ioy is darkened,Iſai. 24. 11 and the
mirth of the world is gone away, to turne
our Harpes into mourning,Iob 30. 31 and our Organs
into the voice of them that weepe?

               For, howſoeuer the Lord delighteth
not in the affliction and ſorrow of his
creatures, being therefore to bee euer
magnified,Pſal, 35. 27 becauſe he loueth the proſperity
of his ſeruants; yet knowing beſt
what is for our good, and prouiding
mercifully that by timely ſorrow for
ſinne, we may haue peace in our latter
end: he doth not ceaſe both by voice &
hand, to inforce this duty of humiliation
vpon vs. One while with loud
threatning hee crieth out as by our
Prophet Ieremy 13. 15. 16. Heare and
giue eare, and be not proud, for the Lord
hath ſpoken it: giue glorie to the Lord
your God, before hee bring darkeneſſe,
and or euer your feet ſtumble in the dark
mountaines, &c. Yea, verſe 18. Say
vnto all [high and low] humble your
ſelues, ſit downe, for the crowne of your
glory ſhall come downe from your heads.
Another while, the former not predailing,
hee vndertaketh by ſtrong
hand to create a day, or rather night,
of mourning: In that day, ſaith he by
the Prophet Amos,Amos 8. 9 I wil euen cauſe the
Sunne to goe downe at noone, and I will
darken the earth in the cleere day, &c.

And I will turne your feaſts into mourning,Verſe 10.
and all your ſongs into Lamentations,
and I will bring ſackloth vpon all
loines, and baldneſſe vpon euery head,
and will make it as the mourning of an
onely ſonne, and the end thereof as a
bitter day. One while he informeth vs
how we muſt ſit our ſelues ſo to draw
neere vnto him, that hee may drawe
neere to vs:
               Iam. 4. 9. [Afflict your ſelues] and
ſorrow and weepe;
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                
               yea, let your laughter
be turned into mourning, and your
ioy into [a ſad looked] heauineſſe.
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                
               Another
while, he lets vs vnderſtand, how
indignely he takes it, that when hee
calles to mourning, men ſhould giue
themſelues to mirth and feaſting: It
was declared (ſaith the Prophet) in the
cares of the Lord of Hoſts.Iſai. 22. 14. 
               But what
followeth? Surely this iniquity ſhall
not be purged from you till yee die, ſaith
the Lord of Hoſts.
            A doome ſufficient, if there were nothing
elſe, to awake and rouſe vs vp to
ſorrowing,Zach. 12. 11. to ſend vs to Iladadrimmon,
and make vs all to fall downe weeping
and wailing as in the valley of Megiddon;
yea to preſent our ſelues before

the Lord, that mercifull great King of
Iſrael,
               1 Kings 20. 32 like Benhadads ſeruants, with
ropes about our necks, acknowledging
what wee haue demerited. For
loe this the ready way to find compaſſion
and abundant kindnes with the
Lord; who hath himſelfe, in Ioel 2. 12.
directed vs vnto this courſe, of renting
our hearts,
               ver. 13. 
               and with faſting, weeping
and mourning, to turne vnto him, that is
gracious, and mercifull, ſlow to anger, and
of great kindnes, repenting of the euill.
For,verſe 14 as it followeth, who knoweth, if
hereupon he will repent, and returne and
leaue a bleſſing behind him? eſpecially,
ſhall we to this noiſe of mourning, adioine
the voice of feruent and humble
crying (as verſe 17. they were directed)
both prieſt and people, weeping between
the porch and the altar, and ſaying, ſpare
thy people, O Lord, and giue not thy heritage
vnto reproch, for wherefore ſhould
they ſay among the people, where is their
God? for ſurely being thus once truly
humbled before the Lord, wee ſhall
finde, as there is added ver. 18. that the
Lord he will be iealous ouer his land and
ſpare his people, hee will not giue his heritage

vnto reproch, not ſuffer the enemie
to ſay, where is their God?
            
               No, for ſeeing the kingdome is the
Lords, who howſoeuer mortall Princes
periſh,
               Lamen. 5. 19 
               yet rein lineth for euer, hauing
prepared his throne in heauen,Pſal. 103. 19 and
by his kingdome ruling ouer all, being
he onely by whom Kings doe raigne,Prou 8. 15 
               and
to whom, as Hannah ſung, belong the
pillers of the earth,1. Sam. 2. 8 who will preſerue the
feete of his Saints,verſe 9 when the wicked ſhall
be put to ſilence in the darke; who dwelleth
among vs as a King in the armie,Iob 29. 25
and as hee that comforteth the mourners,
ſaying,Iſai 51. 12 I, euen I am he that comfort you;
who are wee that wee ſhould feare any
mortall man, or the ſonne of man who
ſhall bee made as graſſe?verſe 13 forgetting the
Lord our maker that hath ſpread out the
heauens, and laid the foundation of the
earth, &c. Doubtles there is none like
God,Deut. 33. 20 O Ieſehurun, which rideth vpon the
heauens for thine helpe, and on the clouds
in his glory, nor any like vnto thee ô
people ſaued by the Lord who is the ſhield
of thine helpe,verſe 29 and the ſword of thy
glorie.
            
               Onely let our Aſae, with all Iudah

               and Beniamin heare the condition of
amitie long agoe proclaimed by the
Lords prophet;
               2. Chro. 15. 2 The Lord is with you,
while you bee with him; and if yee ſeeke
him he will be found of you:Iſai 62. 5 
               Then ſhall
we be a crowne of glory in the hand of the
Lord, and as a roiall Diademe in the
hand of our God: yea, he himſelfe, the
Lord of hoſtes ſhall bee vnto vs for a
crowne of glorie,Iſai 28. 5. and for a diademe of
beautie: and to our King eſpecially, as
to his ſeruant Dauid,2. Sam. 22 51 a tower of ſaluation
ſhewing mercy to his annointed, euen to
his ſeruant Iames our Soueraigne, and
to his ſeed after him for euer.
            Wherefore, for concluſion, to apply
our ſelues both to that ancient
counſell, and the preſent hand of God;
(this being as the Philoſopher told the
Romane Emperor,
               Herodian l. 1 Non hoc, Iudorum tempus, ô Commode, &c. 
               no fit time for ſporting,
when as not the ſword of Perennius,
or any mortall enemy, but the
glittering ſword of the immortall God,
may ſeeme to bee vnſheathed and ſhaken
at vs,) let vs, as many as deſire to
ſee the welfare of Ieruſalem, and peace
vpon Iſrael, ſo addreſſe our ſelues to

mourning,Amos 4. 12 that we may prepare to meet
our God comming out againſt vs, who
will no doubt be pacified towards vs,
and repenting of the euill,
               2. Sam. 24. 16 
               will ſay to the
deſtroying Angel, it is ſufficient, hold now
thine hand; when hee ſhall behold vs
humbling our ſelues before him in
vnfained repentance, and hearty
praier.
            
            
               Firſt, in repentance. For ſeeing the
Lord hath himſelfe begunne to ſearch
vs, as he did this people, and that wee
ſuffer doubtles for our forenamed
ſinnes;
               Lament. 3. 40 
               what ſhould we, but (after their
example) ſearch and try our waies, and
turne againe vnto the Lord? who now
aſſuredly hearkneth whether any ſpeake
aright,Ierem. 8. 6 repenting him of his wickednes,
and ſaying, what haue I done? which if
he may heare, behold a booke of remembrance,Malach. 3. 16
ſhall bee written before him for
them that feare the Lord, and thinke vpon
his name. Oh thē, let vs for our parts,
write our booke of Remembrance, &
becauſe of all this,Nehe. 9. 38 make a ſure couenant
with the Lord, and we our Princes & our
Prieſts, put hand and ſeale vnto it. Into

which whoſoeuer ſhall refuſe to enter,
and to ſay with vs, woe now vnto vs that
wee haue ſinned,Ierem. 4. 13 
               ſhall certainly one day
bee forced to cry out, woe and alaſſe
vnto vs, for wee are deſtroied.
            Yea further for a ſpeciall proofe of
our ſincere and ſerious Repentance, let
vs with Aſa and the people vnder him
vpon the forementioned admonition
ioifully enter into a league and oath of
aſſociation,
               2. Chr. 15. 22 not only our ſelues to ſeeke
the Lord God of our fathers, with all our
heart, and with all our ſoule: but alſo
whoſoeuer will not ſeeke the Lord God of
Iſrael (but will cleaue to,verſe 13 or plead for
Baal, and either become themſelues,
or approue of that accurſed Ieſuited
generation, that account it merit orious,
to vndermine and blow vp Parliament
houſes, to murder and maſſacre
ſacred Princes, yea to kill young
and old, nocents, as they reck on them,
and innocents all together, their
friends for company ſo their foes may
periſh) ſhall I ſay according to the iuſtice
of that law, let them be ſtaine, whether
great or ſmall, whether man or woman?
               
nay rather in charity, I wiſh
firſt for their good, that they might be
cōpelled to ſerue the Lord:
               2. Chro. 34. 33 or otherwiſe
for our Churches peace, & kingdomes
ſafety, that either they were exiled
quite from among vs, that they might
infect no longer, or ſo curbed at leaſt,
that their number and ſtrength might
not encreaſe, to endanger vs farther.
            For ſurely (to ſpeake plainely) howſoeuer
it be good to repoſe our confidence
alone in God, of whoſe careful
goodnes this land hath had ſo plentifull
experience; yet ſhall we, as behoueth
vs, conſider the continuall machinations,
and attempts of theſe Ieſuitiſh
Locuſts poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of
their Prince Abaddon,
               Reuel 9. 11 or but looke vpon
the wound that freſhly bleeding in
our neighbors ſides (the reward which
that redoubted French King Henry the
fourth, receiued for taking downe the
ſtatue of reproch, and admitting aagaine
this viperous broode into the
heart of his kingdome) how can wee
iudge it leſſe then a tempting of God

to relie ſtill vpon miraculous deliuerances,
if wee ſuffer meane while to the
preiudice of our head, the taile of the
falſe Prophet,
               Iſai 9. 15 and popery, to ſpread it
ſelf, as a contagion thorough our land?
Surely if the ſwarmes of thoſe Locuſts
fill euery corner, and take liberty
ſecretly to poiſon and infect both the
mother & the children, (if not to packe
them ouer ſea to Rome or Rhemes &c.
to be farther corrupted) we are in danger
neuer to want pricks in our eies, and
thornes in our ſides,
               Numb. 33. 55 
               to vexvs in the good
land, where we dwell; or cruell Eſaus
that gape but for a mournfull day,
               Gen. 27. 41 to
take aduantage againſt their more
bleſſed and therefore hated brethren.
The God of coūſell work in the hearts,
of them who are in chiefeſt place and
power, carefully to prouide for the
welfare and ſafety of this Church and
ſtate, eſpecially of that light that maketh
great Britain glorious, that al the
ſmoke of the bottomles pit may neuer
dazle or eclipſe his ſhining brightnes.
            For vs, the beſt part of our armour againſt

theſe, & al both enemies & euils,
what is it, but (which before was noted
as neceſſary to be adioined to our Repentance)
to poure forth earneſt and
ſeruent praier vnto the Lord, with whō
               hauing power,
               Gen. 31. 28 
               wee ſhall vndoubtedly
preuaile with men.
            
            Firſt, for our ſelues and land in generall,
that our crying ſins, the cauſes of
iudgement, vpon our true Repentance
being pardoned, there may be an
end put to the Lords cōtrouerſie; that
the peace being renewed beween God
and vs,Iob 22. 21 
               we may haue all proſperity; or if
the Lord ſhal ſee that we ſtand in need
of farther chaſtiſement, he would be
pleaſed yet to allow vs Dauids choiſe,
that we may fal into his hands with whō
is mercy,
               2. Sam. 24. 14 
               and not into the hands of vnreaſonable
and ruthleſſe men.
            
            Secondly and principally, let our
praier be vnto God for his royall Maieſty,
as to preſerue his Princely perſon,
making,(Baruch 1. 11) 
               his daies vpon earth as the
daies of Heauen, that vnder him we may
leade a quiet peaceable life,
               1. Tim. 2, 2 
               in all honeſty
and godlines, wiſhing him what the ancient

Chriſtians did vnto their Emperors,Tertul. in apologet, cap. 30. vitam prolixam, Imperium ſecurum, &c.
that God would grant him a long

loue, and with aſſurance of his mercy
towards himſelf, his gracious Queene,

               Yea, let the King reioice

in thy ſaluation. Giue him his hearts deſire,
and denie him not therequeſt of his
lips. Preuent himwith liberal bleſſings, &
keepe the crowne of pure gold vpon his

head. Yea, ô Lord, that hee may long
continue our crown, Adde to his yeers
as to the daies of Hezekiah, and let his
glory be great in thy ſaluatiō, increaſe of
honour & dignity now in his elder yeeres
being laid vpon him. Finally, let him remaine

Lord, making him glad with the ioy of
thy louing countenance. For why? The
King truſteth in the Lord, and therefore
in the mercy of the moſt high hee ſhal not
miſcarry. For behold, Gods hand ſhall
finde out all his enemies, &c.

hitherto alſo dealt miraculouſly in
preſeruing thine annointed ſeruant
Iames our gracious Soueraigne; ſo

               let all his enemies bee clothed
with ſhame, but vpon himſelfe and his,

               let the crown of theſe Kingdomes flouriſh,
that happy he may be for euer,Pſal. 146. 5. 
               hauing
thee the God of Iaacob for his aide,
and wee thy people happy, and our

thy Chriſt for our Soueraigne king,
and our Princes vnder him, maintaining
thy truth,Eccleſ. 10. 17.

               Come, and let vs returne vnto the
Lord: for hee hath ſpoiled, and hee
will heale vs; he hath wounded vs,
and he will binde vs vp.
