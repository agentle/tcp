            To the tune of, When flying Fame.
            
               
                  
               
               A Counsell graue our King did hold,
               with many a Lord and Knight,
               That he might truely vnderstand,
               that France did hold his right.
            
            
               Unto the King of France therefore,
               Imbassadors he sent,
               That he might truely vnderstand,
               his minde, and whole intent:
            
            
               Desiring him in friendly sort,
               his lawfull Right to yeelde:
               Or else, he swore by Dent of Sword,
               to winne the fame in F
                     •
                  elde.
            
            
               The King of France with all his Lords,
               which heard his message plaine,
               Unto our braue A
                     •
                  bassador,
               did answere in disdaine:
            
            
               And said, our King was yet too young,
               and of too tender age,
               Therefore we weigh not of his warres,
               nor feare not hi
                     •
                   courage.
            
            
               His knowledge is, in feats of Armes,
               as yet, but very small:
               His tender Ioynts more fitter were,
               to tosse a Tenis ball.
            
            
               A Tun of Tenis balles therefore,
               in pride and great disdaine,
               He sent vnto our noble King,
               to recompence his paine.
            
            
               Which answere, when our King did heare.
               he waxed wrath in heart,
               He said, he would such, balles prouide,
               should make all Fraunce to smart.
            
            
               And armie then our King did hold,
               which was both good and strong.
               And from South-hampton is our King,
               with all his Nauie gone.
            
            
               In France he landed safe and sound,
               with all his warlike traine,
               Unto the towne of Hurslew next,
               he marched vp amaine.
            
            
               But when he had besieg'd the same,
               against their fenced walles,
               To batter downe their stately Towres,
               he sent his English balles.
            
            
               This done, our Noble King,
               marcht vp and downe the land.
               And not a French man for his life,
               durst once his Force withstand.
            
         
         
            
            ¶ The second part, Of the battell at Agen-Court.
            To the tune of, When Flying Fame.
            
               VNtill he came to Agen Court,
               
               where as it was his chance,
               To finde the King in readinesse,
               with all his power of France.
            
            
               A mightie Hoste he had prepar'd,
               of armed Souldiers then:
               Which was no lesse, by iust account,
               then fortie thousand men.
            
            
               Which sight did much amase our King:
               for hee in all his Hoste,
               Not passing fyfteene thousand had,
               accounted with the most.
            
            
               The king of France which well did know,
               the number of our men,
               In vaunting pride vnto our Prince,
               did send a Harrold then,
            
            
               To vnderstand what he would giue,
               for Ransome of his life,
               When they in Field had taken him,
               amidst that bloudy strife.
            
            
               But then our King with chéerefull heart,
               this answere them did make,
               And said, before this comes to passe,
               some of your hearts shall shake.
            
            
               And to your proud presumptious Prince,
               declare this thing (quoth hee)
               Mine owne heart bloud shall pay the price,
               none else he gets of mee.
            
            
               With that bespake the Duke of Yorke,
               O Noble King, quoth hee,
               The leading of this Battell braue,
               vouchsafe to giue it me.
            
            
               Godamarcie Cousin Yorke, quoth hee,
               I grant thee thy request,
               Then martch thou on corag
                     •
                  ously,
               and Wee will lead the rest.
            
            
               Then come the bragging French men downe,
               with their cruell force and might:
               With whom our Noble King begun,
               a hard and cruell fight.
            
            
               The Archers they discharg'd their shafts,
               so thicke as haile from Skie,
               That many a French-man in the Field
               that happie day did dye.
            
            
               The Horse-men tumbled on the Stakes,
               and so their liues they lost:
               And many a French man there was taken,
               for prisoners to their cost.
            
            
               Ten thousand men that day was slaine,
               of Enemies in the Field,
               And eke as many prisoners,
               that day was forst to yeeld.
            
            
               Thus had our King a happie day,
               and v
                     •
                  ctory ouer France,
               And brought them quickly vnder foote,
               that late in pride did prance.
            
            
               The Lord preserue our Noble King,
               and grant to him likewise,
               The vpper hand, and victorie,
               of all his Enemies.
            
            FINIS.
