                  Brother from Venice, being thus disguisde,
                  I come to proue the humours of my sonne:
                  How hath he borne himselfe since my departure,
                  I leauing you his patrone and his guide?
               
            
            
               Vnck.
               
                  I faith brother so, as you will grieue to heare,
                  And I almost ashamde to report it.
               
            
            
               Fath.
               
                  Why how ist brother? what doth he spend
                  Beyond the allowance I left him?
               
            
            
               Vnck.
               How! beyond that? and farre more: why, your exibition is nothing, hee hath spent that, and since hath borrowed, protested with oathes, alledged kindred to wring mony from me, by the loue I bore his father, by the fortunes might

               Brother, what is the manner of his life? howe is the name of his offences? if they do not rellish altogether of damdation, his youth may p

               Vnck.
               
                  Why Ile tell you brother, hee is a continual swearer,
                  And a breaker of his oathes, which is bad.
               
            
            
               Unck.
               
                  I grant indeed to sweare is bad, but not in keeping those oathes is better: for who will set by a bad thing?
               
                  Nay by my faith, I hold this rather a vertue then a vice,
                  Well, I pray proceede.
               
            
            
               Vnck.
               He is a mighty brawler, and comes commonly by the worst.
            
            
               Fath.
               By my faith this is none of the worst neither, for if he Brawle and be beaten for it, it wil in time make him shunne it: For what brings man or child, more to vertue, then correctiō? What raignes ouer him else?
            
            
               Unck.
               He is a great drinker, and one that will forget himselfe.
            
            
               Fath.
               
                  O best of all, vice should be forgotten: let him drink on,
                  So he drinke not churches.
                  Nay and this be the worst, I hold it rather a happines in him,
                  Then any iniquity. Hath he any more attendants?
               
            
            
               Unck.
               Brother, he is one that will borrow of any man.
            
            
               Fath.
               
                  Why you see so doth the sea, it borrowes of all the smal
                  Currents in the world, to encrease himselfe.
               
            
            
               Vnck.
               I, but the sea paies it againe, and so will neuer your son.
            
            
               Fath.
               No more would the sea neither, if it were as dry as my sonne.
            
            
               Vnck.
               
                  Then brother, I see you rather like these vices in your sonne,
                  Then any way condemne them.
               
            
            
               Fath.
               
                  Nay mistake me not brother, for tho I slur them ouer now,
                  As things slight and nothing, his crimes being in the budde,
                  It would gall my heart, they should euer raigne in him.

                  That may indeed, tis very fitly plyed,
                  I know not how it comes, but so it falles out
                  That those whose fathers haue died wonderous rich,
                  And tooke no pleasure but to gather wealth,
                  Thinking of little that they leaue behind:
                  For them they hope, will be of their like minde,
                  But falles out contrary, forty yeares sparing
                  Is scarce three seuen yeares spending, neuer caring
                  What will inshue, when all their coyne is gone,
                  And all too late, then thrift is thought vpon:
                  Ofthaue I heard, that pride and ryotkist,
                  And then repentance cryes, for had I wist.
