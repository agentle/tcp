            And the prohemye of the auctour begynneth.
            
               Myn auctour wryteth in this prohemye
               That many men / haue trauayled here tofore
               To ſhe we by reaſon and auctoryte
               That it is grete wytte / and wyſdome more

               without conſtraynt / but of his neclygence
               His wyll to folo we / and his vnclene delyte
               As luſty folke in theyr adoleſcence
               Haue ſuche deſyre / and ſo grete appetyte
               On Uenus brydle / for to champe and byte

               wherby full / oft they ſuffre paynes ſmerte
            
            
               Unto whoſe reaſon / and opynyon
               It may be ſayd / and anſwered thus agayne
               Man hath no good wytte ne entencyou
               In his yonge tyme / whan nature dooth conſſrayne

               Of this frayle worlde vnſure and tranſytory
               None other thynge is in his memory
            
            
               As thus whan men in youth couragyous
               with fre wyll ende wed and luſtynes
               Of theyr deſyre / and mynde outragyous

               Nothynge content with theyr felycyte
            
            
               For where as they may frely ryde or go
               And at theyr choyſe / dyſporte them ouer all
               I you enſure theſe younge men wyll not ſo
               whan they leeſt wene / than ſodanly they fall
               And vnconſtrayned make theyr bodyes thrall
               Lyke to a wyght that in to pryſon depe
               without cauſe / all haſtely dooth crepe
            
            
               So do they oft for lacke of kyndely wytte
               
                  And whan they be within this pryſon ſtrayte
               The gayler cometh and faſt the dore dooth ſhytte
               whiche is ofyren ſtronge / and in a wayte

               And ſpecyally men may call hym aſſoted
               Ferre frome reaſon / of wyſdome deſolate
               That thus his tyme myſſe vſed hath and doted

               Some men do call theſe Ioyes ſorowes grete
               But yet they take them well in pacyence
               For of neceſſyte they muſt forgete
               The care / trouble / ſorowe / payne and offence
               The whiche they ſuffre at the reuerence

                  The teeres fell downe fro her eyen two

                  I had be buryed / for neuer ſo grete ſhame
                  
                     Betydde to ony woman ne dyffame
                  As to me and my kynne / now ſhall belayd
                  Alas I laboure ſore / and faſt ſhe ſayd
                  And all the laboure beſyneſſe and coſt
                  That I haue done of many a daye is loſt
                  In twenty places or moo I had be maryed
                  If I ſo wolde / but lyke a fole I taryed
                  For where I myght grete honour & auayle
                  Haue had / and rycheſſe / therof now I fayle
                  I knowe how that theyr wyues be byſene
                  That wolde haue maryed me / which doth me
                  And therfore haue I heuyneſſe and wo
                  That deth the lyfe nyll take my body fro
                  Thus ſhe complayneth her withouten care
                  Of her huſbande / or how the good man fare
                  For hooly ſhe hath ſette her mynde vpon
                  Her owne eſtate / and ſhortely ſhe is gon
                  Unto this maryage / and where ſhe ſholde
                  Haue thought vpon her huſbande ſhe ne wolde
                  But to this poore man putteth all the wyte
                  Lyke as an hors that can bothe playne & byte
                  This woman dooth / and ſhe is cauſe of all
                  For ſhe this man hath made ſo beſtyall
                  Som what for ſorowe / or elles wyſe by playe
                  That well nygh waſted is his wytte a waye
                  So that he wyll not vnderſtonde ne knowe
                  That ſhe is in defaute / wyll he not trowe
                  And though he ſe the maters euydent
                  yet of neceſſytee he is content
                  But of the thought & ſorowes to enquere
                  It is but waaſt / ſyth ye the cauſes here
                  Of this man whiche can neyther reſt ne ſlepe
                  That thynketh euery houre and taketh kepe
                  
                     How that he may in eaſe this woman ſette
                  And fynde ſome remedy to paye his dette
                  But yet is he more angry for his wyfe
                  Whiche curſeth hym / than all that other ſtryfe
                  Thus ſoroweth he / in pouertee downe fall
                  And frome that payne recouer neuer ſhall
                  Prycked he is / but ſmarte can he none fele
                  That all is Ioye / to hym it ſemeth wele
                  Thus is this man within the lepe ycloſed
                  And parauenture ſo he is dyſpoſed
                  That he nothynge therof dooth hym repent
                  For yf that he out of the ſame were hent
                  Soone wolde he go agayne in to that gynne
                  And all his payne and woo newly begynne
                  yet ſholde he neuer be in ſoo good cas

                  And other comēth asnygh her as he may
                  And ſetteth his fote a lofte on hers playne
                  Eke by the honde quyckly he doth her ſtrayne
                  Alſo an other his loke caſteth a ſyde
                  Full pyteouſly and ſharpely for a tyde
                  An other than vnto her dooth preſente
                  A dyamonde ryght fayre and oryente
                  Or elles a ryche rubye with a rynge
                  Whiche ſhe receyueth with ſome other thynge
                  By whiche thynges may ſhe well vnderſtande
                  Of theyr entent / and fele it with her hande
                  If ſhe haue ony reaſon brayne or wyt
                  And other whyles by fortune happeth it
                  That frome her chayre alyght wyll ſhe adown
                  To doo ſome werkes of deuocyon
                  Or vnto Uenus to doo ſacrefyſe
                  But how can I not ſaye ne in what wyſe
                  This ſely man at home in poore degree
                  Is made and brought vnto neceſſytee
                  For thylke eſtate that his wyfe doth pretende
                  The mater thus hath dryuen to an ende
                  And made her go to gaderynges and feeſtes
                  Amonge a wycked company of geſtes
                  For vnto her they yolden be in truſt
                  To haue theyr pleaſures appetytes and luſt
                  Upon none other thynge do they aweyte
                  But how they may doo this poore man deceyte
                  The ſtroke wherof he hath without eſcape
                  Whiche comynly is called but a Iape
                  So he is cauſer of his propre ſhame
                  None other wyght therof is for to blame
                  And thus it happeth by contynuaunce
                  
                     That what by ſygnesſpeche or countenaunce
                  Trouth of the thynge wherof he was in doute
                  All openly reported is aboute
                  Wherby he falleth Ialouſe in a rage
                  Out of the whiche there is no wyght ſo ſage
                  That hym can moue / for who that feruently
                  Of woman feleth the cruell malady
                  There is no medycyne that may hym cure
                  The ſekeneſſe is ſo ſharpe without meſure
                  Than wyll he bete her bytterly and curſe
                  Wherby the werkes maketh he moche worſe
                  For chaſtyce can he not by daye ne nyght
                  His wyfe but by his betynge maketh lyght
                  And hote the loue bytwne her & her frende
                  Thus dryueth he the mater to an ende
                  And ſoo he other whyles fortune may
                  One of her lymmes breke or kytte a way
                  Wherby his caſtell or his pyle he loſeth
                  Than as a maſed beeſt he hym dyſpoſyth
                  Withouten care and all he ſetteth at nought
                  Thus hath he founde ye payne whiche he hath ſought
                  And neuer after wyll ſhe loue hym more
                  Bycauſe that he hath beten her ſo ſore
                  But for to paſſe the tyme and make a ſhe we
                  And of fayre wordes ſpeketh ſhe but fewe
                  There this poore man in turment payne & wo
                  Lyueth and yet he thynketh not ſo
                  And all theſe ſoro wes / he for Ioyes doth take
                  Soo in the lepe he is I vndertake
                  Encloſed depe / and yfhe were withoute
                  Yet ſhortely wolde he in withouten doute
                  There vſeth he his lyfe in paynes alwayes
                  And wretchedly / thus endeth he his dayes
                  
               
               Thus endeth the ſeconde Ioye of maryage.
            
            
               ¶Here begynneth the thyrde Ioye of maryage.
               
                  
               
               
                  ANother Ioye whiche named is the thrydde
                  Of maryage in no wyſe may be hydde
                  The whiche I purpoſe ſhortely to dclare
                  Accordynge to myn auctour and not ſpare
                  The whiche is whan man in youth doth wedde
                  A yonge mayde / and whan they bothe in bedde
                  Haue had theyr pleaſures largely and deſyre
                  And well aſwaged is the brennynge fyre
                  The hoot herueſt is well ouerblowe
                  As it with me and other is I trowe
                  Soone after this her bely doth aryſe
                  
                     And waxeth grete / as is the comyn gyſe
                  Wherof the huſbande alwaye hath the name
                  And perauenture he nothynge to blame
                  Is of the dede / for ſo it happeth ofte
                  As ſome men ſaye in preuy counſeyllſofte
                  And therat meryly wyll laughe or hum
                  But this is de ſecretes mulierum
                  The huſbande than in to ſuche thought doth fall
                  And turmentes that he ronne and trotte ſhall

                  Forth on his Iourney ſwyftely doth he ſpede
                  And yf he tryppe or ſtomble by the waye
                  He may fall in the myre by nyght or daye
                  And grete auenture ſhall be yf he brynge
                  Uytaylles that may be good to her lykynge
                  All thoughe he hath done neuer ſo grete payne
                  Whyles he was out / tyll he came home agayne
                  And ofte it happeth ſo that for ſuche mete
                  As comynly ſhe vſed hath to ete
                  Bothe luſt and appetyte from her do pas
                  Bycauſe her ſtomacke is not as it was
                  Than ſhe deſyreth to haue thynges ſtraunge
                  And noueltees her dyerte for to chaunge
                  For whiche this poore man muſt trotte on fote
                  Or elles ryde there is none other bote
                  Bothe nyght & daye / to gete where he may fynde
                  Suche delycates as may content her mynde
                  And in this turment ſeuen yeres and more
                  Is this good man / and yet ſhe euermore
                  Nothynge wyll do but playe the wanton ſo
                  That therof pyte hath this huſbande tho

                  This poore man doughters hath yet one or twayne
                  The whiche may fortune wolde be maryed fayne
                  They redy be and on the houre they tarye
                  Awaytynge faſt who wyll come them to marye
                  They be in Ioye▪and it may happen to
                  The man is poore / and lyueth in care & wo
                  Nygh moneyles / and hath no grete ſubſtaunce
                  For maryage to make his cheuyſaunce
                  Alſo vnto his ſones he muſt bye
                  His doughters & his other ſmall meynye
                  Doublettes hoſyn kyrtels and vytayle
                  And many an other thynge withouten fayle
                  His ſayd doughters he muſt repayre and kepe
                  All honeſtely and gaye / elles wyll they wepe
                  And for thre thynges this nedely muſt be done
                  One is bycauſe they may be aſked ſone
                  Of dyuers galauntes dwellynge them aboute
                  
                     An other is withouten ony doute
                  All were it ſo that this good man ne wolde
                  yet ſo to be / for nothynge it ne ſholde
                  For why the wyfe hath paſſed the ſame ways
                  And ſhe ne wyll it ſuffre by this daye
                  Alſo there is an other reaſon why
                  Bycauſe they haue good myndes & hertes hye
                  And are accuſtomed to be freſſhe & gay
                  For otherwyſe wyll they not be ne may
                  And in auenture yf they otherwyſe
                  Entred were / anone they wolde practyſe
                  To haue theyr Iolynettes / for helpe and eaſe
                  But there an ende / of that I holde my peaſe
                  So is this man on euery parte dyſmayd
                  Theſe charges berynge / as afore is ſayd
                  And perauenture ſoo he is beſtadde
                  That ſymplely and poorely he is cladde
                  Of whiche araye yet careth he nothynge
                  So he may haue a paſſe tyme and lyuynge
                  And this ſuffyſeth well to hym alwaye
                  As to the fyſſ he doth in the lepe to playe
                  Whyles he may haue a tyme and ſuffraunce
                  Therin to lyue and languyſſhe ni penaunce
                  And yet therby abbredged ben his dayes
                  So fareth it by ſuche a man alwayes
                  The whiche in to the lepe of houſholdynge
                  Is put where he ſhall ſuffre ſuche turmentynge
                  As I haue ſayd / and other innumerable
                  And thus he ſeeth theſe thynges ſo chargeable
                  That all he ſette at nought ſoo he lyue may
                  As doth an hors morfounded by the waye
                  Whiche none accompte doth ſet by ſporre ne thynge
                  That may to hym be done in trauaylyage
                  
                     This not withſtondynge / wheder he wyll or not
                  Forth hym behoueth for to goo and trot
                  To gouerne londe and lyuelode whiche is his
                  Ryght after ſuche eſtate as he of is
                  And perauenture he hath horſest wayne
                  The whiche be lene & poore for lacke of grayne
                  And it ſoo fortune may he hath but one
                  Or yet not one / but forth he gooth anone
                  And .xx. myle or fourty from his place
                  He trauaylleth / within a lytell ſpace
                  Unto the parlyament / or to thaſſyſe
                  Where he hath for to ſewe in dyuers wyſe
                  For ſuche a cauſe▪as other thynges amonge
                  Hath ben dependant in the lawe there longe
                  A payre of botes well of thre yeres olde
                  Or foure he hath to kepe his legges frome colde
                  The whiche full ofte haue mended ben alowe
                  Ryght craftely for drede it ſholde be knowe
                  So that parte whiche was ſomtyme on the kne
                  Amyddes the ſhynne muſt nedely vſed be
                  Full ofte they chaunged haue theyr former face
                  And that hath brought them from aboue ſo bace
                  A ruſtye payre of ſporres he hath eke
                  Wherof one of the rowelles be to ſeke
                  Alſo of .x. yeres olde he hath a gowne
                  Not of the neweſt gyſe ne facyowne
                  The whiche for drede that he ſholde it appere
                  Excepte on hygh feeſtes he nolde it were
                  Or elles whan he frome home ſholde go or ryde
                  All other tymes it was layde clene a ſyde
                  The cauſe why it was of ſo olde a ſhappe
                  May be for ſoo it fallen is by happe
                  That gownes be made all in a newe gyfe
                  
                     But this to hym dooth well ynoughe ſuffyfe

                  To ſaythe trouthe in your entencyon
                  But alway faſt in this opynyon
                  I wote not by my ſoule ſhe ſayth my loue

                  wherof he maketh none accompte ne tale
                  And peraduenture ſhe is whyte or pale
                  Of nature feble / and complexcyon

                     Thynketh on other thynges and elles where
                  She wolde ſhe were / and god wote heuely
                  Is ſhe content / but well and womanly
                  She kepeth her kyll / and dooth hym as rioche good
                  As caſt a ſtone agaynſt a pyece of wood
                  For helpe hym ſelfe / can he not ne ſocoure
                  And ſhe nothynge is gladde of his laboure
                  How be it other dyde ryght well afore
                  And ſhe aſyde turneth her chere therfore
                  A lytell / for that tyme / ſo ſtant the cas
                  For this is not / the good wyne ypocras
                  whiche ſhe afore at other tymes had
                  This dooth her ſore anoye / for it is bad
                  My loue ſhe ſayth / ye make me all a fole
                  Better it were for you vpon a ſtole
                  To ſytte / and of ſuche beſynes you reſt
                  This good man whiche all taketh for the beſt
                  Kepeth hym as well / and derely as he may
                  That he of longe tyme wyll by no way
                  Do her dyſpleaſure / treſpace or offence
                  The payne he dooth endure with pacyence
                  He doubteth lore the good wyfe to dyſpleaſe
                  And ſo he reſteth / ſom what for his eaſe
                  For he beleueth well / that of the game
                  Nothynge ſhe wolde / in ony wyſe attame
                  So putteth he hym ſelfe in ſuche dotage
                  That he ſuppoſeth well it were domage
                  To her complexyon ſhe is ſo lowe
                  And ſymple eke ſuche wordes for to knowe
                  Bycauſe percaſe / that lately of her hewe
                  She is dyſcoloured in a maner newe
                  wherfore the mater better he beleueth
                  And it may fortune after thus it preueth
                  
                     That this good wyfe a goune or other thynge
                  Of her huſbande wolde haue to her lykynge
                  She knoweth well by his condycyon
                  whan tyme is beſt to make a mocyon
                  Aduyſynge in her mynde hym to begyle
                  To haue all her deſyre / and on this wyle
                  Remembreth ſhe / that whan they and no mo
                  In chambre be / and it dooth fortune ſo
                  That they in pleaſures and delytes be
                  And in her mynde / ſhe dooth perceyue and ſe
                  That he with ſome thynge wolde haue to do
                  Then wyll ſhe put her good wyll there vnto
                  And to make hym ſuche dalyaunce and chere
                  That it is meruaylous to tell or here
                  For why / a woman lerned in that arte
                  A thouſande thynges newe vpon her parte
                  Can do / to make good chere and dalyaunce
                  To whome ſhe luſt / ſuche is the guyſe of fcaunce
                  So in this dede the good man is well eaſed
                  For he is not accuſtomed to be pleaſed
                  with ſo good maner chere / and contenaunce
                  She clepeth hym with all the cyrcumſtaunce
                  And on the vyſage / kyſſeth ſhe hym ofte
                  where as ſhe lyketh / with her lyppes ſofte
                  Then this good man in this maner dooth ſay

                  I wolde haue had none other by my choys
                  Though it had ben the dolphyn of vyennoys
                  I thynke almyghty god / wyll it ſo be
                  That I ſhall lyue with you / and you with me
                  For why / my fader and my moder bothe
                  Dyſpleaſed were with me / and wonder wrothe
                  Bycauſe to haue ſuche one I nolde accorde

                  Good reaſon is that he endure therby
                  The ſhame whiche he afore ſought beſyly
                  As in this caſe I counte hym caſt away

                  Grete peryll renneth & aege cometh hym vpon
                  So is he folyſſhe lyke a beeſtly man
                  In euery thynge by reaſon of the play
                  And he within the lepe I dare well ſay
                  Ycloſed is / in ſorowe and heuyneſſe
                  Whiche he doth take / for Ioye and gladneſſe

                  Thus ſhall he dwell in paynes euermo
                  And ſo ſhall ende his dayes wretchydly
                  Syth he wyll fynde / none other remedy

                  Suche is the pleaſure / whiche this man hath founde

                  Sayth that it is grete domage for to ſe

                  It is nothynge but good ryght of the play
                  So lyueth he / with payne in pacyence
                  And all theſe ſore wes dooth hym none offence
                  The whiche for Ioyes alwaye taketh he

                  In ſuche a maner comen hath and gone

                  The ſtreyght entre / and alſo ferthermore
                  He hath her founde whome he demaunded fore
                  And he ſome other myght percas haue had
                  But for no thynge he wolde / and he is glad
                  Of this / for as hym ſemeth he hath ſete
                  His loue ſo wele / that no man coude do bete
                  And that he was ſo happy her to fynde
                  whiche ſo good is / and mete vnto his mynde
                  And peraduenture ſuche a man is he
                  
                     As by her councell wyll well ruled be
                  So that whan ony wyght hath for to do
                  with hym / he ſayth I ſhall go ſpeke vnto
                  The good wyfe of our houſe / and yf ſhe wyll

                  In no wyſe ſhall the mater take effecte
                  As pleaſeth her ſhe wyll graunt or reiecte
                  And here it cometh to the poynte anone
                  I put the caſe he be a gentylmon
                  And that his prynce an army do prepare
                  with whiche he is commaunded for to fare
                  Then yf the wyfe it wyll for the ſhall he go
                  And yf ſhe do replye / he ſhall not ſo
                  Unto the wyfe / thus may he ſay perchaunce
                  My loue I muſt me ſpedely auaunce
                  Streyght to the kynges army well arayed
                  And ſhe ſhall ſay ſyr / be ye not afrayed
                  what wyll ye go and cauſe you to be ſlayne
                  How ſholde we do yfye come not agayne
                  ye thynke but lyte what ſhall become of me
                  And in good poynt / than ſholde your chyldren be
                  But ſhortely for to ſpeke / yf it her pleaſe
                  He ſhall go forthe / and ſomtyme for her eaſe
                  Ofhym the hous ſhe can delyuer clene
                  whan that her lyketh beſt / here what I mene
                  For whyder it pleaſeth her hym out to ſende
                  He ſhall go quyckely forthe / and there an ende
                  Unto ſuche ſayntes as ſhe auo we hath made
                  whiche to perfourme for her he wyll be glade
                  And whyder yt it be wynde / ſnowe hayle or rayne
                  Upon her byddynge ſhall he go certayne
                  And ſo may be a galaunt herynge this
                  The whiche her lemman or her louer is
                  
                     And knoweth the entres of the houſe about
                  Well vnderſtandynge that this man is out
                  Deſyrynge with her for to ſpeke and talke
                  Withouten taryenge wyll to her walke
                  For lenger in no wyſe may he abyde
                  But on the nyght / whan come is the tyde
                  In to her houſe he entreth ſecretely
                  And where as the good man was wonte toly
                  This homely galaunt boldely lyeth hym doune
                  Whiche hath god wote a grete deuocyon
                  For to accomplyſſhe his deſyres and wyll
                  And this good wyfe her kepeth cloſe and ſtyll
                  The whiche dyſdeyneth for to crye or call
                  Ryght well in paeyence ſhe taketh all
                  For whan ſome woman ſeeth a man dooth take
                  Grete payne and labour onely for her ſake
                  Of pyte neuer wyll ſhe hym refuſe
                  And though that ſhe ſholde deye he ſhall her vſe
                  She hath a bowe that by her ſtandeth bent
                  And he artyllery that muſt be ſpent
                  It happeth ofte he in the houſe abydeth
                  And in a corner preuyly hym hydeth
                  Whan that a lytell dogge dooth at hym bay
                  And yf the good man / what is that wyll ſay
                  The wyfe wyll anſwere / ſyr it is a ratte
                  That he dooth barke / or elles at the catte
                  For ofte tymes afore he hath doone ſo
                  Thus wyll ſhe ſay with many wordes mo
                  So ſhortly for to ſpeke this man is trapped
                  And in the lepe he cloſed is and lapped
                  She maketh hym the chyldren for to bere
                  Whan they wolde play / and dady here and there
                  Alſo ſhe cauſeth hym to take and holde
                  
                     Her ſpyndell and the thredes to vnfolde
                  Upon the ſaterday / whan ſhe dooth rele
                  And ſhe wyll chyde yf he do not wele
                  Now hath he foūde a thynge whiche he hath ſought
                  And vpon hym newly dooth fall a thought
                  For warre begynneth in that regyon
                  And euery man vnto the ſtrongeſt toune
                  Wyll drawe that he can fynde to ſaue his lyfe
                  But he at home abyde muſt with his wyfe
                  And may not leue her wherfore he perchaunce
                  Is take pryſoner / and grete fynaunce
                  Then muſt he pay / or elles in pryſon dwell
                  This can this man of care and ſorowe tell
                  Whiche in his huſholde kepynge he hath founde
                  For nyght and day he muſt trotte on the grounde
                  Uytayles to gete / or for ſome other nede
                  And ſhortly for to ſay ſo dooth he ſpede
                  That his poore body neuer ſhall haue reſt
                  Unto the tyme he put be in his cheſt
                  Then falleth he in ſykenes and in aege
                  Wherby with hym is paſt luſt and courage
                  Well leſſe than prayed ſhall he be alway
                  And lyke a foulecouer be caſt away
                  Whiche is not wrothe to occupy that crafte
                  So is all Ioye and pleaſure hym beraft
                  The wyfe hath doughters two or thre or mo
                  Whiche wolde be maryed / and they be not ſo
                  Wherfore they prayſe this good man but a lyte
                  But haue hym in dyſdayne / and grete dyſpyte
                  In to the goute he falleth ſeke and ſore
                  And helpe hymſelfe ſo ſhall he neuer more
                  For euyll paynes ſuche as he hath had
                  Whiche with his wyfe / hath thus ben ouerlad
                  
                     Than may this poore man his ſynnes wepe
                  Within the lepe / where he is cloſed depe
                  Out of the whiche he neuer ſhall departe
                  But ſtyll remayne / and euer take his parte
                  Of Ioyes ſuche as be in maryage
                  Whiche he from youth hath founde vnto his aege
                  And yet hym fallen is more heuyneſſe
                  For he ne dare cauſe for to ſynge a meſſe
                  Ne make his laſt wyll and teſtament
                  But yf his wyfe ther vnto wyll conſent
                  For he to her ſo buxome is and bonde
                  That body and ſoule he putteth in her hande
                  Thus vſyth he his lyfe in languyſſhynge
                  Alway / and eke a ſorowfull endynge
                  He ſhall ſuſtayne and wretchedly his dayes
                  This man ſhall ende withouten myrth or playes
                  And all is the cauſe of his good wyfe
                  That cauſeth hym ſo to be caytyfe
               
               ¶ Here endeth the twelfth Ioye of maryage.

                  Can not of greter payne and ſorowe tell

                  With her and with her huſbande wedded newe

                     They ſhall be ſlayne withouten ony remedy
                  And they aryſe bothe all haſtely
                  A fore that he the doores can vp breke
                  And ryght pyteouſly to hym dooth ſpeke
                  Alas my loue ſhe ſayth / what do ye now
                  I wende ye had ben deed I make auow
                  By many a man it hath benſhewed and ſayd
                  That ye were ſlayne and in your graue ylayde
                  But for that I wolde knowe the certaynte
                  I was vnmaryed more than yeres thre
                  And ſuche a ſorowe made I nyght and day
                  That all my wytte and reaſon fyll away
                  Helples I was / longe tyme in wo and care
                  And god it wote full euyll dyde I fare
                  That ye were deed / eche man ſayd out of doute
                  And I ne coude well brynge ye worlde aboute
                  Wherfore my frendes aduyſed me to mary
                  And ſo I dyde / for what cauſe ſholde I tary
                  Ye neuer ſente me worde / how that ye dyde
                  But ye alway your counceyle fro me hyde
                  And as this wyly woman ſtode and talked
                  The newly wedded huſbande / ſoftely ſtalked
                  And toke a bowe in hande / and dyde it bende
                  And boldly ſayd / he wolde his place defende
                  Than ſayd the wyfe vnto her huſbandes bothe
                  Good gentyll ſyrs / yfye wolde not be wrothe
                  But well agre / I truſt you bothe to pleaſe
                  My ſelfe / and you at euery tyme well eaſe
                  The olde huſbāde thus knowȳge of theyr dede
                  Departeth ſodaynly / for he muſt nede
                  With ſhame ynough / and haſteth hym away
                  And they within the houſe faſt laugh and play
                  And after this ſo ſeke he is and ſadde
                  
                     That he within a whyle is waxen madde
                  Wherfore I ſay / he that may fortune ſo
                  As dyde this man whiche wolde for honour go
                  The way in to the lepe of maryage
                  Streyght hath he founde as byrde in to the cage
                  How be it he afore was not ſo wyſe
                  Of ſo grete Ieoperdyes to take aduyſe
                  So ſhall he lede his lyfe and hym enable
                  To be a ſole / and mete to bere the bable
                  And at the laſt in paynes greuouſly
                  He ſhall his dayes ende / and wretchedly
               
               ¶Here endeth the .xiii. Ioye of maryage.
