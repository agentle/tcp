                  DAVIDS teares By Sr John Hayward knight, Doc. of Lawe
                  LONDON Printed by John Bill. 1623.
               
            
         
         
            
            
            TO THE READER.
            
               HAuing finished my SANCTVARIE, and finding it to haue taken roote and life for some continuance; I could not conceiue any better imployment of those houres, which I haue resolued to sequester for exercises in this kinde; then in making my conceptions legible vpon those Psalmes of DAVID, which liuely describe, both the forme

and the force of true repentance. Partly in regard of the generall dignity of the whole Booke of Psalmes, largely extolled by many; but chiefly in regard of the eminent excellency of these Penitentiall Psalmes, which heereafter I entend particularly to declare. And heerein I aime at no priuate end, but designe, and resigne my endeuors wholly to the Glory of the All-powerfull GOD: to whom Glory is so proper, that nothing is more repugnant to reason, then either not to attribute it to him, or to seeke to draw it to our selues.
            For albeit GOD, who is all fulnesse and perf
                  •
               ction, cannot receiue accesse or increase; yet by praysing and blessing his exteriour workes, we enlarge and spread his glory to others. This praise and glory, because we cannot incorporate into his essence, whereto no addition can bee

made: we are sayd to attribute to his NAME. For the NAME of a thing is separate, and externall from the thing which it serueth to signifie; and neither a part nor of the substance therof.
            But we on the other side, are inwardly hollow and empty, and alwaies wanting some amendment. Wherefore we haue enough to doe to labour in repairing that. We must not play our part for exteriour shewes; but inwardly, within our selues, where no eies shine but our owne. Otherwise we shalbe like to an Egge long couered with salt; the shell wherof wilbe faire and sound, but the inward substance altogether consumed. Or like an vnwise hunger-starued beggar; more desirous of a faire garment, then of necessary meat. Hee who seekes himselfe abroade; who regardes more what hee is to

to others, then to himselfe; who doth honestly, because he would be so esteemed; shall neuer produce profitable effect. As the intention is vaine, so wilbe the euent. But if constantly wee pursue reason and piety, let approbation of others follow if it please: as neither vainly desired, so not rigidly to be contemned.
            Much lesse must they expect any benefit by their trauailes, who retire themselues to priuate studies. For they liue not out of themselues, they study not other mens humours, they applie not their thoughts to the time. And this is the reason wherfore many well esteemed for sufficiency, whose vertue forbids them to be base, hang vnder the wheele, and cannot aduance. Yea, sometimes it happeneth, that whilest they are most honestly busied, men of scornefull and beggarly

ignorance, separate from all imitable qualities or endeauours, will be nimble to nippe from them such small matters as they haue.
            I confesse I haue beene bitten by some such Vipers; who thinke nothing sufficient that they haue, nothing dishonest that they doe. But I enuie not the grauell in any mans throat. It sufficeth for mee that I haue attained a quiet contented life, free either from anguish in my selfe, or enuie at others: free either from wishing great matters, or wanting some small: a life fit for serious cogitations.
            The rich compositions of Ancient times, I reuerence and admire; they doe not only satisfie, but astonish mee. I see them not to the depth, but I see them so farre, that I conceiue the farthest reach of our age cannot neerely approach

them. Of my owne productions, neuer any did fully content mee, and the approbation of others is no warrant to my owne iudgement; tender and seuere in what I doe. They may happily bee somewhat sprinkled ouer, but throughly died, I conceiue they are not. And in case any thing be excusable in them, it is not in regard of themselues, but in comparison of some other form-lesse vnsinewie writings; whereto notwithstanding I finde good allowance to bee giuen. Assuredly, knowing my owne ignorance and defects, I wonder much at the constant assurance of many others.
            But modestie forbids vs to speake good or ill of our selues. I haue heere vndertaken a difficult taske, in writing vpon these high parts of Scripture. I did put forth two of these psalmes at the first, for

an assay, as before I did the like in my Sanctuary. And finding some acceptation I haue now added a third: and intend to proceede in some of the rest. And wherein I finde no encouragement from others, I will remaine satisfied with my owne contentments For by entertayning my thoughts in these sweet retreits, how many tedious and friuolous cogitations haue I auoyded? How many indignities and discontentments haue I therein buried? Let others hungerly hunt after fauour and wealth, the common drudgery of the world: let them spend their spirit and honestie in vnciuill vnderminings. I desire and pray, that this heauenly harmony may alwayes ring in my eares; that I may close the last period of my life with one of these songs of Sion.

            PSALME VI.
            
               
                  
                     O LORD rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy displeasure.
                  
                     2 Haue mercy vpon me, O LORD, for I am weake: O LORD heale me, for my bones are vexed.
                  
                     3 My soule is also sore troubled: but LORD how long wilt thou punish me?
                  
                     
                     4 Turne thee, O LORD, and deliuer my soule: Oh saue mee for thy mercies sake.
                  
                     5 For in death no man remembreth thee: and who will giue thee thankes in the pit?
                  
                     6 I am weary of my groning, euery night wash I my bed, and water my couch with my teares.

                     9 The LORD hath heard my petition: the LORD will receiue my prayer.
                  
                     10 All mine enemies shall be confounded

and sore vexed: they shall bee turned backe, and put to shame suddenly.
               
            
            
               Of the title and parts of this PSALME.
                     1 THE inscription of this Psalme.
                     
                     2. The Authour thereof.
                     
                     3. Wherefore Dauid watered his bed with teares.
                     
                     4 Our conflicts in this life, and the weapons thereof.
                     
                     5 Wherefore the iust are sayd to flourish like a palme tree.
                     
                     6 Wherefore this Psalme is intituled, To him that vanquisheth.
                     7. The parts of this Psalme.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               THis is the first of those Psalms which are called Penitentiall; and according to the version of Saint Hierome and of Felix, beareth this inscription or title, A Psalme of  Dauid to him that vanquisheth (pro octaua) for an instrument of eight strings.
            
            For, that Dauid was the Authour of this Psalme, it  is nothing doubted; not only because it hath beene

both anciently and generally so receiued, but because diuers passages of the Psalme doe plainely seeme to import no lesse. For therein is liuely expressed a most exquisite sense of sorrow and griefe; agreeable, as well to the greatnesse both of the person and sinne of Dauid, as to the large measure of grace, which afterward he did obtaine. It maketh mention also of (stratum) a kinde of couch vsed by men of eminent  dignity; which as Dauid had defiled with adulterous embracements, so did hee there chiefly exercise his sorrow, so did he there plentifully powre foorth his teares. Verely, as the sinnes of Princes are neuer small; so their great sinnes require a great and high degree of repentance.
            
                Now, in this life we are neuer at perfect peace, we are trauayled with continuall conflicts, wherin some armour is of necessary vse. But in these spirituall combats, sorrow, sighes, groanes, and teares are the onely armour of defence, the onely weapons of aduantage; by which wee atchieue true victory and  triumph. For this cause it is sayd, that the iust shall flourish as a Palme tree.
               Psal. 92.11 For as the Palme tree doeth flourish best vnder greatest weight; so vnder many difficulties and oppressions the iust must mount to their highest hopes. And therefore because by these armes Dauid did preuayle, not onely against his outward enemies, not only against his inward troubles and perplexities, but against the wrath and vengeance of Almighty GOD: because by these meanes  his griefe was turned into ioy: because hee beganne with bitter anguishes, and ended in exultation and

triumph: this Psalme is entitled, To him that vanquisheth: therefore also it was appointed to bee sung vpon an instrument of eight strings, called Octaua; vpon which, as S. Hierome sayth,
                  Super paral. ca. 15. In Ci
                        •
                     haris pro Octaua, can
                        •
                     bant Epinicion.
                they vsed to sing Psalmes of triumph and ioy. And so this Psalme falleth naturally into two principall parts, as in the Table following doeth appeare.
            
            
               
               
                  In this Psalme of Dauid is conteyned his
                  
                     
                        sorrow and conflict, wherein is expressed
                        
                           
                              a fearefull apprehension of GODS Iustice, vers. 1.

                     7 Which turneth the trembling soule to GOD.
                     
                  
               
               
                  O Most glorious GOD! infinite in Maiesty, to be both honoured and obeyed; infinite also in might, to be feared: The greater thy Maiesty  is, the greater are my offences against it to bee esteemed; and the

greater punishment may thy Almightinesse inflict. As thy Maiestie is infinite, so is euery offence against it infinite; so is infinite punishment due to such offence. This infinite Maiestie haue I many wayes most grieuously offended; and therefore haue iust cause to feare thy grieuous displeasure, thy grieuous punishment: euen equall to my sinne, and that is infinite.
               
                   I feare not thy reproofe, I feare not thy corection; I dayly expect it, I dayly desire it; because dayly I deserue it. For I know that dayly I offend, and I know that thy diuine Iustice will not suffer offences to remaine vnpunished.
                     Verebar omnia opera mea sciens quod non parceres delinquenti. Iob. 9. If thy Iustice punisheth only in this life, then is it fatherly, then mercifull, then is it iustice tempered with mercy: but if it punisheth in the life to come, then is it extreame Iustice; then extreme rigor and reuenge; then is it as a rod of yron, vpon a potters vessell.
                     Psal
                     ▪ 2. The one is among men, and oftentimes by them; the other is in the company and by the office of Deuils.
                     Sicut erudit homo fi
                           •
                        ium suū, sic Dominus Deus crudit te, vt custodias mandata sua. Deut. 8.5. Heb. 12.6. The first is a gentle instruction, a chasticement, a correction; the last a seuere and finall execution. This rodde of thy correction I kisse, I embrace thy chasticements vpon my knees; If I were exempt from thy Fatherly chasticement, then were I exempt from being thy childe, For thou scourgest euery childe whom thou receiuest. But I feare thy fury, I tremble at thy extreame displeasure. I desire to feele thee as a louing Father, but not as an angry and inflexible Iudge.
               
                  
                  Rebuke me not, O LORD, with thy violent voice, let not thy angry arme beat stiffely vpon me. It will

consume me, as a flaming furnace; It will swallow me, as a deuouring gulfe; It will driue me as a torrent, into the headlong descent of eternall death & damnation. What strength can stand vnder thy Almighty arme? What courage can behold thy fierce bended brow, and not bee astonished, not stroke downe with terrour? LORD, I now feele thy anger in a moderate measure, I now feele thy temporary and temperate wrath, which I am not able to endure; but heereby I am further led to esteeme the ful charge of thy fury, how vnable I shall be to endure thy eternall indignation. How little a portion haue we of him?
                  Iob 26.14. 
                  but who can vnderstand his fearefull power? Assuredly, the generall floud, the destruction of Sodome, all thy punishments which haue beene, shall be, or can be inflicted in this life, are to bee deemed but as a few gentle drops, in regard of the full tempest of thy eternall wrath.
               
               In that day of thy wrath, when we shall stand forth at the barre of thy Iudgement; What soule can sustaine thy angrie eye; whose sight will pierce to the very center of our hearts, and rippe vp euery festred corner of our consciences? What other accusers? What other euidence will thy iustice require? certainely if thy voice was terrible when thou gauest thy Law, if thy chosen people were then afraide;Exo. 20.13 how terrible will it bee when thou shalt demand an accompt of thy Law? when thou shalt giue sentence for the breach therof against thine enemies? Depart from me yee cursed. Out alasse! What a punishment  of losse is this? to be banished from thy face,
                     Poenadamni.
                   whose

beauty cannot be expressed, which the Angels insatiably desire to behold; the sight wherof is the full perfection of all pleasure and abundance, the true ioy and rest of our soules. What death is so grieuous as this departing? But whither (O LORD) doest thou command to depart? Into euerlasting fire. Out alasse!  This is a cruel curse indeed. Whom wil it not appal? whom will it not astonishwith feare?
                     Poenasensus. Isa. 33. What? Into euerlasting fire? without either intermission or end? Alasse! Who can abide with the deuouring fire? Who can dwell with the euerlasting flames?
               
               
                  This is the very habitation of thy wrath, in this place thy fury doth raigne. Our abhominable sins inflame thy wrath, and thy wrath inflameth this fire against vs. Heere thou hast no presence of compassion, none of comfort; none but simply of indignation and wrath. Heere thy wrath will bee so inexorable, that if all the Angels, if the whole court of heauen should intreat thee prostrate vpon their faces, for one drop of water, to refresh one part of a tormented sinner, for a very short moment of time; they should not obtaine, thou wouldest not bee entreated. LORD, let me neuer heare this terrible voice, let me neuer feele this weight of thy wrath; albeit I haue iust cause to feare it. For I haue beene ouercome, I haue yeelded to the sway of my sottish sensuality; I haue disobeyed thee, I haue rebelled against thee, I haue deserued, I haue prouoked thy displeasure against  mee: And now my conscience quaketh, and formeth many fearefull representations to my soule. Mee thinkes I see thee come furiously vpon me; thy

                  wrath (me thinkes) is euen now ready to strike. But stay, patient LORD, hold thy hand, forbeare a while: giue mee leaue to collect my astonished and dispersed thoughts; to erect my soule, and direct it to thee. Before thou commest in iustice to ouerwhelme mee with thy wrath, In Iustice heare what I haue to say for my selfe. Regard the silent sobs which my feeble soule, surprised with feare, sendeth foorth: regard the broken voice, which my trembling tongue addresseth to thee.

Wilt thou make proofe of thy prowesse against my weakenesse? thinkest thou that I am come to combate with thee? to defie thy fury? to wrestle with thy wrath? LORD I am weake; I am wretchedly weake; because my  weakenesse is inclinable to euill.1. Weakenes
                   I am weake in resisting outward prouocations, weake in resisting the pleasures of mine owne appetites and desires. This weakenesse is miserable in me, but hath alwaies been  strong to mooue thee to mercy. For wherefore else hast thou repaired the sinne of man, and not of Angels? Verely because man sinned through weakenes of nature, but the sinne of Angels proceeded meerely from malice of will. For with the more frailty a sinne is committed, the lesse doth it participate of will; and the lesse voluntary a sinne is, the readier is thy mercy to relieue. And therefore seeing thou forgauest Adame, whose nature was entire; forgiue me also I beseech thee, whose nature is corrupt and enclineable to euill: seeing also thou wert mercifull to him who charged his fault vpon another; be fauouable, O LORD, to me who accuse and condemne

only my selfe.Gen. 18.27. 
                  For this cause therefore I will speake vnto my LORD, albeit I am but dust and ashes.
               
               LORD, thou hast, made me, and thou knowest of what temper I am made: For no man is ignorant of his proper work. Thou hast not made my nature of brasse, my sinewes are not of yron, nor my strength of steele; but thou hast made me of fraile flesh, yeeldable to all occasions of euill. My soule thou hast placed in this case of clay, as in a boate, driuen with the strong tyde of sensuall appetites; which cannot be caried against that streame, but by great labor, by strong striuing with armes and with Oares. LORD, I do not lay forth this weaknes of mine, to excuse my sin, but to encline thee to mercy. For the LORD is merciful to them that feare him;Psal. 103. 
                  because he knoweth wherof we be made, he remembreth that we are but dust. I haue sinned indeed, but rather through weaknes, then either malice or proud presumption: rather through a vicious and corrupt disposition infused as an inheritance from my ancestors, then through hellish either haughtinesse or hate originally in my

                   but much more in rising from my fall; in repairing my state, in recouering thy  loue and fauour againe.
                     Perditio tua ex te Israel, tantummodo in me auxilium tuum. Hos. 13. This I can no waies doe by my naturall strength, no wayes without thy speciall power. I am able to offend thee, to fetter my feete in the snares of sinne, to bring my selfe into danger of

thy wrath; but to appease thee, to free & releeue my selfe, I am altogether vnable. I can cast my selfe into the deepe pit of perdition; but come forth and returne backe, by my owne forces, I cannot. And therefore I still straine my voyce vnto thee: Haue mercy vpon me, O LORD, for I am weake. Weake in falling; weake in rising; but most weake I am, either to encounter or endure thy wrath.

Correct mee in fauour, but not in furie: to my instruction scourge me, but not to my destruction. Alas! my weakenesse hath made mee sinfull, and my sinnes haue made me miserable; and my  misery now sueth to thy mercy. If my misery were without sinne, then I would plead it before thy iustice, thy iustice would then relieue my case; but for that it proceedeth from my sinne, I lay my plea at the barre of thy mercy. Haue mercy vpon mee, O LORD, for I am weak

                  : I am not able to beare thy iustice, I am not able to behold it; I am so farre vnable to endure the force of thy wrath, that the feare thereof hath almost vndone me. It hath possessed euery part of my body, It maketh my feeble flesh to  tremble, it doeth torment my very bones. For vnfained feare and griefe of minde, will soone worke effects in the body; because the body and the soule are so firmly and familiarly knit together, that whatsoeuer ioy or griefe happeneth to the one, it is forthwith

communicated to the other:
                     Cor meum & caro mea exultanerunt in Deum vitium.
                   euen as in two roomes ioined together, whatsoeuer motion or stirre is in the one, it is easilie sensible in the other.
               
                  Blessed LORD, thou art alwayes good; thou hurtest no man, vnlesse himselfe be in the blame, vnlesse  it be through his owne default. For as the Sun beame is cleare and comfortable in it selfe, and so is it to the eye that is sound, yet to a sore eye it is very grieuous: not through any default in the Sunne, but by the diseased disposition of the eye: so albeit thou in thy selfe art perfectly good, and doest nothing but good, yet to a sinner thou art grieuous; thy goodnesse can doe no other then trouble and torment him: not through any euill influence from thee, but by reason of euill disposition in himselfe. And therfore, O gracious goodnesse! O mercifull LORD! O louer of mankinde! not onely in pity pardon my weakenesse, but in power remoue it; that I may bee strong and able to enioy thy goodnesse; that thy goodnesse be not greeuous vnto me. LORD! I resort  vnto thee, not only as to a Iudge for pardon, but as to a Physitian for cure. My weakenesse hath taken a deepe surfet of sinne, and it is now growne to a desperate disease. All the faculties of my soule are infected, and the poyson is dispersed through all the members of my body. I can feele no strength, I can feele no quiet: not onely my feeble parts, but they that are most strong are troubled alike. Haue mercy vpon mee, and heale mee. O GOD! Haue mercy vpon my imperfection, and heale my infection, I humbly entreat thee. Let thy mercie extend not only to pardon

mee, but to heale mee: not onely to pardon my sinnes that are past, but to make mee strong and able against sinnes heereafter. For what good will pardon doe mee, if presently I returne to my sinne againe? What will it auaile that I bee washed, if foorthwith I plunge my selfe in the mire? LORD, I present my selfe vnto thee in the lowest degree of humility and griefe; my eies charged with teares, my breast with sighes, my tongue with complaints, my whole bodie with disquiet: Let thine indignation now cease, looke vpon mee with a more calme countenance. Helpe me vp and I will rise, hold me vp and I will stand: comfort and confirme my sin-oppressed sences. Haue mercy vpon me and heale me: giue me thy health and strength, that vnder confidence of thy mercy I may boldly looke thy iustice in the face.

                  AND yet, the trouble of the bodie might bee borne well enough: a mans courage may suffice to beare out any bodily griefe; but who can beare the vexation of the soule? The paine of the body, is but the  body of paine; the sorrow of the soule, is the soule of sorrow. Now thy terrours haue also surprised my soule. Not onely my body is cruelly crushed, both with the sence of my sin, and feare of thy wrath; but my soule also is very grieuously afflicted with the one, and affrighted with the other. This soule which thou hast created to praise thee, is astonished to behold thee, astonished to thinke on thee: this soule which is the breath of thy mouth, is vnable to endure the breath of thy displeasure: this soule which thou hast created to represent thy likenesse, hath no liking, no power to sustaine thy presence. The loue thereof is extinguished with feare; it hath neither roome nor respite to hope in thee. In thee it dares not rest assured, in any other thing it cannot. For  assuredly, whensoeuer earnest and vnfained contrition seazeth vpon the soule, it disturbeth all ioy, it

taketh away pleasure in any thing but teares; it permitteth not to thinke on any thing but what is terrible. And as they who are in danger of shipwracke, cast ouer board their rich and best esteemed Merchandises, to saue their liues: so they who are tossed with the tempest of GODS anger,

The vnderstanding is darkened, the will dazled, the memory confounded, the courage broken and beaten downe: dread and amazement haue dulled my sences. But aboue all, my conscience is goared with the sting of sinne. It anguisheth, it lanceth, it stretcheth, it teareth, it crucifieth the very heart of my soule; It stirreth all vpside downe.

                   Verely, I finde it to be very true, That the heart of a sinner is as the raging sea, which neuer hath rest: The waues whereof are alwaies in motion, and one alwaies dashing against another. I leade a life euer dying, and I feele a death neuer ending: all my choice is concluded in this; whether I will stand still without helpe, or stirre any waies without hope.
               And as a fearefull Doue shaketh at the roaring of thunder, and shrinketh into some obscure hole, supposing it self most safe when it is least seene: so my amazed soule, trembling at the dreadfull sound of thy threats, looketh about for some place of retreit, either

to defend or to hide it from thy furious face. It would flie from thee, but it knoweth not whither: it would be protected against thee, but it knoweth not by whom. O my GOD! I cannot flie from thee, but by flying to thee. And therefore I flie from thee  offended, to thee appeased; I flie from thee through the gate of thy iustice, and I flie to thee thorow the gate of thy mercie; I flie from a iust reuenging Iudge, to a mercifull and indulgent father; whose goodnes is infinite, whose mercie is a spring, a streame, an Ocean that cannot be exhausted: the goodnes no lesse liberall, then the mercie is abundant.

               For sinne is so offensiue, so odious vnto thee, that  wheresoeuer thou findest it, thou canst not affoord a kinde countenance; thou must needes turne away thine amiable eies; thou wilt not displaie thy beautie vpon so filthie a dunghill.
               And this is the cause why wee are so troubled: 
                  For when thou turnest away thy face they shall be troubled.
                  
                     Auertente te faciem tuam turbabuntur.
                   Assuredlie, the vexation of my soule can haue neither end nor ease, vntill thou turnest to mee thy appeased countenance. All other appliancies are as the handling of vlcers and wounds; they doe but draw more humours to my sore; they rather inflame

then any waies asswage it.
               
                   But how long, O LORD! how long will thine indignation? how long, O LORD! shall my anguish endure? how long wilt thou with-hold thy comfort from me? Thou who hast alwaies beene slowe to wrath, art thou slow now to lay downe thy wrath? Thou who hast euer beene patient, art thou now become inflexible? Is thine anger no lesse hard to quench now, then heeretofore it hath beene to kindle? O desire of my soule! thou knowest my tribulations, my thoughts lie naked in thy sight: thou seest how for thee my heart sorroweth, my breast sigheth, mine eie weepeth, my body fainteth, and my soule languisheth. And wherfore tariest thou? wherfore dost thou prolong my longing? wherefore dost thou martyr me with delay? VVhy sufferest thou me thus long to be vexed? Is the cause heereof in thee? or is it in my selfe? Are thy mercies spent? is thy louing kindnesse at an end? wilt thou no more bee intreated by sinners? or am I only cancelled out of thy conceit?
               
                   No, no: I doe not so feelinglie want thee, I doe not so ardentlie desire thee as my case requires. Verelie, the cause is in my selfe, and not in thee. There is some trespasse in my teares, my sorrow is seasoned with some sinne: thou seest some cause for which I cannot see thee: else wouldest thou not thus estrange thy selfe; else thus thou wouldest not giue me ouer. I am rather vnworthy to entertaine thee, then thou vnwilling to come vnto mee. VVell then, I will still stir vp the coales of my dull deuotion; I will heape

on more fewell; I will not cease blowing vntill it rise to a full and constant flame; I will not entreat onely, but I will importune thee; I will wrestle with thee as Iacob did with the Angel: I will not let thee goe vntill thou blesse me.

                  O Come, mercifull LORD! come and turne vpon me thy fauourable face; come exercise vpon me the worke of mercie. Regard me not as sinfull, but as sorrowfull for my sin: punish not my offences, but pity the weaknesse from whence they proceed; pity the distresse whereinto they haue cast me: pitifullie regard my weakenesse and distresse. For I feele my soule plunged in a  vast sea of sinne; I feele how fast it sinketh, how violentlie it is swallowed. I haue greedily grasped at the floating comforts of this life; but I finde no stay in them; I finde they rather pester then releeue me. I finde them like a flash of lightning in a darke stormy night; which serueth to shew the present infelicity, and to increase the horror of ensuing darknesse. And therefore doe I now streine out my voice, and stretch  foorth my hand vnto thee for helpe. Gladlie would I turne to thee, but I am not able: for there is so great a distance betweene a sinner and thee, that by his owne forces he cannot return and come neere thee. Depart from thee, and adhere to euill of our selues we may; but we cannot forsake euill and turne to thee, but by thy speciall power. No man by his proper vertue is able to saue, and consequently to  iustifie himselfe; thy grace must alwaies preuent

him; thou must first call him, before he be able to  cal vpon thee.

The beginning of our conuersion must be from thee, from thy preuenting and inciting grace. And therefore turne to me, and then shall I be turned to thee: Turne vnto me, not by any change in thy selfe, for thou art immutable: but turne to me by thy goodnesse and grace: and I will turne to thee by repentance and amendment of life.
               Oh! how grieuous is it to bee separated and estranged from thee? what good can comfort? what euill will not annoy when thou art turned away? Thou art the rock of my faint faith,

In thee I trust, vpon thee I relye: I am so  earnest in desiring thee, that I neither desire nor almost thinke vpon any other thing. But where art thou? In what cloud doest thou hide thy selfe? what meanest thou to suspend thy comfort so long? to punish my desire so much with delay? Wherefore hidest thou thy face and takest me for thine enemie? Albeit  thou art angrie with me, yet would not I haue thee depart from me: I had rather enioy thee angrie, then not at all;

                        sequimini & comprehendite, quia non est qui eripiat? Psal. 71.9. because thou art most extreamely angrie when thou turnest from vs. When thou art angrie and present, then doest thou instruct vs, then reforme vs: but when thou turnest from vs, then thou giuest vs ouer, then thou leauest vs to innumerable and vnauoidable euils. Albeit my friends forsake me, albeit my enemies persecute me, albeit all the societies of men and of Diuels tumult against mee, yet doe not thou forsake me, doe not thou depart from

me.Hos. 9.12. 
                  For woe to them from whom thou departest.
               
               But take heed, O troubled soule! and consider well  what thou requirest of the LORD. Art not thou a sinner,Iob. 10.6. a grieuous sinner? is not GOD a searcher of sinnes? a grieuous punisher of grieuous sinnes? Doest thou not pray to him to turne away his face from thy sinnes?
                  Ps. 51. Vbi abscondam me a vultu irae tuae, quia peccaui ni mis. Iob. 13 Did not holy Iob say, where shall I hide me from thy countenance because I haue sinned? And wouldest thou haue him turne his face to thee, being a most heynous sinner? Yes, yes: I know well enough what I desire. I know that GOD hath more faces then one.Exo. 33.20 He hath a face of Maiestie which no man can see and liue. This face I cannot see. He hath a face of iustice.

But hee hath another face of compassion and mercie. And this face is like the Sunne: exceeding full both of beautie and of vertue. This face hee hideth from sinners. This face I desire to be displayed vpon me, be it neuer so cloudie, neuer so angrie: the anger of this face, is to make sinners pure.Ier. 50.20. Num. 6.25 
                  LORD make this face to shine vpon mee, and be mercifull to mee. LORD, this face doe I seeke:
                  ps. 27.9.10. 
                  oh hide not thou thy face from mee, nor cast away thy seruant in displeasure.
               
               Come, come, gracious LORD: with-hold no longer. O water of life! O shower of our saluation! distill  into mee one drop of thy dewe. Seeing I am nothing without thee, let me taste the benefit of being thine. I desire thee, and not thine: for thy selfe, not for thy gifts. I desire thee onely; not thee for any

thing, nothing for thee, nothing with thee, nothing beside thee. Come, deliuer my soule from the chaines of sinne, wherewith I am bound to satisfie the rigour of thy iustice, by eternall death and damnation. Deliuer me from long custome of sinne: deliuer mee both from the pleasures and cares of this world; which are cables to tye me, fetters to hold mee captiue from turning to thee. Deliuer my soule and saue me. First, deliuer my soule from present distresse, then addresse me in the right way of thy saluation.
               It is true, that there is no desert, no goodnes in me, that should any wayes mooue thee to pitie or relieue mee. For I haue loosely abandoned thee, I haue trayterously conspired against thine honour, I am altogether vnworthy, but in wrath and reuenge to bee regarded of thee. But I entreat thee by thine infinite goodnesse (which is sufficient to abolish all the sinnes in the world) euen in the lowest descent of humilitie, for thy mercies sake I beseech thee, to saue mee. LORD I crie to thee in the confidence of thy mercies, and not of my merits: whereto no saluation, but eternall death and destruction is due. And if thou wilt not absolutely be entreated, yet this word mercie is a maine argument to mooue thee, or to assure me at the least that thou wilt saue me.
               For thou art merciful, both inwardly in thy selfe, & outwardly to others. It is thy proper nature to beê  merciful: it is more proper for thee to do good,
                     Misericors & miserator Dominus. Psal. 115. to impart thy selfe to al things, then it is for the Sun to enlighten, then for the fire to giue heat: thou canst not but exercise the actions of mercie. But vpon whom?
                  
vpon righteous persons? what needeth that? For they haue no miserie, because they haue no sinne, which only is misery, which onely needeth mercie. Is it then vpon small offenders? is it to a certaine degree and measure of sinne?
                     Patiens & mu
                           •
                        tum misericors. ibid.
                   Why, but thou art exceeding mercifull; infinite in mercie; no lesse infinite in mercie, then in nature: for thou art mercy. Verely, as  the rich man oweth his reliefe to the poore; and the greater his riches are, the greater is his debt: as also the more poore a man is, the more right hee hath to demaund reliefe: euen so, the greater thy mercies are, the more must thou exercise the same vpon miserable sinners; and the more miserable and sinfull a man is, the more boldly may he come to thee for mercie. The miserable sinner, ouercharged with sinnes, may confidently make his suit vnto thee; to doe thy duty, to exercise thy action, to take away his misery, to impart to him thy mercie: that where sinne abounds,
                     Vbi abundauit delictum superabundauit & gratia.
                   grace also may more then abound.
               Men doe therefore giue sparingly, or at the least in some measure, because the more they giue, the lesse they reteine: but thy treasure cannot be either exhausted or diminished; thou departest with nothing  by imparting to others; by giuing abundantly, thou hast nothing the lesse. Thou art a fountaine of pitie and mercie, from whence innumerable streames proceede: the waters whereof are infinite, both in quantitie and in vertue; as well to cure our wounds and infirmities, as to wash away our filthines, and refresh our weakenesse. O infinite fountaine! how canst thou bee dried? O sweetnesse! O sacietie of desires!

what languishing soule came euer to thee, and was not both cured, and clensed and fully refreshed? Doubtlesse O Lord! thou art exceeding mercifull; and wilt both readily and largely distribute thy mercies among offenders. Thou wilt deliuer them & saue them, if they turne vnto thee; if with penitent hearts they desire thy mercie. Thou art more liberall to giue, then they can be either desirous or willing to receiue.

                     6. The discommodities of late repentance.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  AND it is not onely thy mercie which bindeth my reason, but also thy wisedome.  For I am thy creature, the worke of thy hands; the worke which thy wisedome hath framed to some end. Thy wisedome hath framed nothing in vaine, nothing but to some end; without attayning which end it should not perish. But it is all one if I had beene created for nothing and in vaine, and if I should not attaine to the end for which I was created.
               
                   To what end then did thy Wisedome create mee in this World? Certainely, that I should know thee, and that by knowing thee, I should loue thee; and that in louing thee, I should neuer cease to remember thee, neuer cease to praise thee: neuer cease to sorrow when I offend thee. To this end I was created, and I am desirous to accomplish this end: I am desirous to be an instrument for extolling thy praise, and setting foorth thy glory.
               But in case I die thus charged with sinne, before thou turnest thy mercie to me, before I turne to thee by repentance; what honor will thereby rise to thee?  what benefit to my selfe? How shall I then partake of thy goodnesse? How shall I publish and praise the same? For so long as we enioy the benefit of life, We nay repent, we may leaue our sinnes, we may returne to the state of grace. But after death followeth iudgement; when no error can be, either repented, or repaired; but euery man shall suffer according as hee hath done. In this li
                     •
                  e we may both dispose our selues,

and incite others to blazon thy praise; but in the dungeon of death, who will thanke thee? who will thinke on thee? who will sing thy praises in the bosome of Hell? This is not a proper place for the sweet harmony of thy praise, for the ioyfull memoriall of thy name. Thy praise consisteth in a thankefull publication of thy grace, goodnesse and mercie. But this is the house of horror, heere thy full furie and vengeance inhabite: here can bee neither thankfull nor ioyfull remembrance of thee.
               It is familiar to the pleasures of this life (if they be  great) to cause vs to forget both thee and our selues. But we are far lesse sensible of pleasure then of paine; paines are more sharpe to vs, in a high degree, then pleasures are sweet. Sharpe paines doe so strongly affect the bodie, they doe so viòlently possesse the minde, that it cannot once thinke of any other thing. Who may then remember thee as he should, being vnder the hand of thy terrible wrath? Who shall either loue thee or laud thee in the ouglie den of death? where the eies are possessed with hideous hurlemēts; the eares, with desperate & fruitles wailings; all the faculties and parts, both with intolerable and endlesse torments. VVhere nothing is either suffered or done, but effects of thine implacable wrath. Assuredlie, they are cursed by thee who are condemned to this place, and heere againe they curse and blaspheme thee.

               For this cause the wiseman exhorteth vs, to turne to thee, to forsake our sinnes, and to make our prayers before thy face. But what is it to do all these things b

face? euen in this life: in which time thy face shineth vpon vs, in which time wee walke before thy face, and may easilie obtaine thy mercie. But the wicked after death are cast behind thy backe, they are drowned in perpetuall obliuion neuer to be remembred, either for pardō or forbearance. They are as the handfull behind the backe of the Mower,
                  Ier. 9.22. 
                  which no man gathereth. When hay falleth before the face of the Mower, it maie be gathered vp againe: but when it falleth behind his backe, it is not regarded, it is cast awaie and perisheth. During this life, whilest wee are before thy face, we may easilie be recouered and restored to mercie: but afterdeath, no hope of reliefe, no expectation but of iudgment.Leuit. 25. The LORD commanded that if any man had sold a house in a walled city, within a yere he should haue power to redeeme it: But after the yere his power to buy it againe was cut off. Now, if for the pleasures of sin we haue sold our eternall habitatiō,
                  
                     Domum habemus non manu factam eternam in coelis. 1. Cor. 5. Psal. 88. 
                  not made with hands: we haue power to redeem it by repentāce, during the yere of our life: that tearm expired, we haue no abilitie to recouer it again. Then shall that of the Prophet take place, Doest thou shew wonders among the dead? or shall the dead rise againe and praise thee? shall thy louing kindnes be shewed in the graue, or thy faithfulnes in 
                        •
                     estruction? shall thy wondrous works be shewen in the darke? and thy righteousnesse in the land where all things are forgotten? Assuredlie, as after death teares are fruitlesse, repentance vnprofitable; as after death no mercy is to be expected, nothing but misery, nothing but wrath: so is it doubtful & very dāgerous that our teares, sighes & groanes, are of little force at

the verie neere approach of death; whether by age, or by extremities of disease. For at that time, when our powers are either distracted or spent; when wee lie either struggling, or panting vnder the arrest of death; when no part is free, either from the sence or feare of his cruell gripe; we may well be said to be in death; or at least wise in such a condition and state, as doth lesse participate of life then of death. And therfore it is doubtfull at the least, lest at that time we shall not remember thee; lest our repentance at that time shalbe too late. A good husband will repaire his house whilest the weather is faire, and not deferre vntill Winter shall approach: a carefull Pilote will furnish his ship whilest the seas are calme, and not staie till tempests are in rage; and a prouident man will repent his sinnes in the seasonable time of health and strength, and not protract vntill he be in the very armes and embracements of death; when manie occasions may cut from him, either his mind, or power, or time to repent. For we haue iust cause to feare, that if we would not when we might, we shall not be able when we would: that by our will to doe euill, we maie happilie loose the power to doe good: that in trouble and necessitie we shall not find that helpe, which in prosperitie and peace we did not endeauour to prouide.
               This hath our Sauiour declared by a familiar example:Luke 14. For that no king making warre with one stronger then himselfe, but will indeauour to haue peace whilest his enemie is farre off; And not expect vntill the sword shall threaten his throat. Darest

thou, then, O vnfortunate worme! O improuident sinner! Who makest war against the omnipotent LORD, who hath all the powers in heauen earth and hell at his command; darest thou (I say) deferre the making of thy peace with him, vntill the point of his furious approach? Vntill the very houre of his encounter? How vaine is thy confidence? How sottish thy sence? Wherefore wilt not thou make thy peace in time, whilest he is far off? Wherfore wilt thou not intreat his mercy before thou cōmest to feele his power. Assuredly,3. Paralip. 18.24. 
                  the day will come when thou shalt goe from chamber to chamber (from one auoidance to another) to hide thee, and yet shalt find neither couert nor defence.
               
               
                   Alas! who dares trust to the broken reede of extreame sickenesse or age? bruised by originall, but altogether broken by our actuall sinnes? Repentance is often vnprofitable, euen in the best time and state of our life, by reason of defect of a right intention: & therefore we haue good cause not to trust to this late and last time of repentance.Heb. 12.17 For if Esau could not finde repentance, albeit hee sought it with Teares; how reasonable may wee suspect our extreame late seeking for repentance? Not because true repentance is euer too late, but because late repentance is seldome true; as proceeding rather from feare, then from loue; from necessitie rather then from willingnesse and desire; rather outwardly pretended, then intended from the heart. LORD turne to me and deliuer my soule; Enlighten my vnderstanding from this grosse darkenesse; free my desires from these massie yron fetters of

time of sanity and strength; and not deferre the waighty worke of my repentance, vntill either by long custome of sinne, or by debilitie of bodie and minde, I shall not be able to thinke on thee.

Behold, O searcher of hearts, how my sinfull soule hath beene arraigned at the barre of mine owne iudgement; how by the euidence of my conscience it is found guilty of many  grieuous offences, against thee, against many men, and against it selfe. How it is committed close prisoner to sorrow. How by solemne sentence it is enioined, neuer to cease groaning, neuer to cease weeping,

vnder this leaden loade of griefe! behold how I sink vnder this sad charge of sorrow! that as sinne is caused by vnlawfull pleasures, so by true and vnfayned sorrow these pleasures may be extinguished, and the sinnes done away. For our sinnes neuer hurt vs, if  wee remember them with like sorrow, as with pleasure we did commit them.
               
                  Alas! my soule is torne in pieces with remembrance of my sinnes; my strength is broken both with the greatnesse and continuance of my griefe.

On the one side, these penitent pressures haue vowed neuer to forsake me, vntill they haue reconciled me to thee; On the other side, my earnest prayers haue vowed neuer to leaue thee, vntill they haue reconciled thee to me. Many streams of teares haue gushed also out of my eyes; and yet will I not close them in one drie sleepe, vntill I haue obtained thy fauour. For in vaine did I begin to repent, if I perseuere not in a constant course: In vaine did I attempt to knocke at heauen gates, if I should giue ouer before they be opened.
               
                  Perseuerance is so necessary a vertue to all penitents;  that without it they neuer attaine the fruites of their endeuours, they shall neuer haue remission of their sinnes. This is the perfection of all vertues;
                     Qui perseuerauerit vsque in fine, hic saluut erit.
                   the iustice of the righteous, the glory of their sufferings, the triumph of their troubles, the accomplishment of their hopes. Without this, neither he that sighteth shall haue victory, nor the victorious glory: without this, no action is acceptable to GOD. For

where the desire of perfection doth end, there doeth the sinne of defection begin: which not onely defaceth, but depraueth all the good that went before: not onely maketh it to be no good, but turneth it to odious euill. A debtor is not discharged by paying much, but by paying all: nor hee crowned who runneth well, but hee who holdeth out well to the end. They onely shall attaine the end of their endeuours, who turne not their feet backe, like the children of Ephraim;Psal. 78.10 Gen. 19. who turne not their eies backe, like Lots wife; who turne not their thoughts backe, like the people of Israel,
                  Num. 11. Quae retro sunt obliuiscens, ad ea quae priora sunt extendens me ip. sum, addestinatum persequor branium. Phil. 3. when they departed out of Egypt. Only they shall be crowned, who with a constant courage pursue their designes, and neither faile nor faint vntill attainement.
               
                  Well then; I will not remit, not intermit the labours of repentance; my wearinesse shall not cause me to giue ouer my groaning; day and night I will not forbeare to weepe. Repentance is a baptisme of teares; and the greater that our fall hath beene, the  greater must be the torrent of our teares. It is naturall to men, that their lamentation bee in some sort answerable to their losse.
                     Quid prodest homini si mundum vniuersum lucretur, animae vero suae detrimentum pattatur. Matth. Cautarizaetam habentes conscientiā. 1. Tim. 4 But my losse hath beene so great, that no teares are sufficient to lament them. I haue lost the grace and fauour of GOD; I haue lost his righteousnesse, I haue lost both his feare and his loue, I haue lost GOD himselfe, I haue lost mine owne soule. Out wretch! What can I bee sayd to haue, when I haue lost both GOD and my selfe. How obdurate is my heart? how dull, how dead is my soule? how is my conscience cauterized and seared,

if for so great losses I cannot weepe? The soule which is sensible of a needels point? shall it not bleed at the strokes of lances and swords? I can weepe for losses in my temporall estate, for losse of worldly kinred or friends I easily fall to immoderat weeping: and can I not open a veine of teares when I haue lost the riches of heauen? when I haue lost both GOD and my selfe? Assuredly, teares are so precious a liquor, that wee should not spend them for ordinary matters. But if not for other things, if not for GOD, yet am I bound to bestow teares for my selfe.Weep not for mee, but weepe for your selues. Luke 27. If for nothing else I may weepe, yet it is lawfull to weepe for my selfe. For in all other matters teares are lost, in case they be not spent for our selues.
               
                  Oh! that I could weepe an Ocean of teares; to  drowne my sorrow, to drowne my shame. Oh! that I could resolue my bowels into teares. So, so: this is right. Sob, O my heart, vntill thou doest ake: shower downe more plenty of teares, O my eies! set your selues on float in a full tide of teares. As vncleane vessels must be first scoured, and then washed; so my impure soyled soule, must bee first well rubbed with griefe, then washed with teares; and so happily it will appeare beautifull and faire. For teares are nothing  worth, if they proceed from a softnesse and tendernesse of nature, and not from a heart attached with griefe. They must be the sweat of the soule, labouring in sorrow: they must bee the bloud of a wounded conscience: they must bee drops from a heart, pierced with griefe.
               
                  Fauourable LORD, receiue the groanes which my

griefe sendeth to thee; winged with sighes, and poysed with teares. Teares which are able to quench hell fire, let them appease thy fiery furie; thou who art by terrors inuincible, yeeld thy selfe to be vanquished with teares. Ah my GOD! thou hast oftentimes heard my groanes, my teares haue often preuayled with thee: heare now my groanes, bee againe intreated with teares. Let not those faults seeme foule vnto thee, which I haue so often washed with my teares.

                     My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worne away because of all mine enemies.

                     8 Our misery is a good assurance of GODS compassion.
                     
                     9 A prayer to that end.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  IMmortall and immutable GOD! Thou seest how I am cast downe, how low I am fallen; euen beneath the base condition of contempt. I am as a withered flower, without either beautie or sap; I am so consumed with griefe, that there remaineth in me neither fauour nor forme. For I lie vnder the seuere hand of thy wrath; I am assailed with outward calamities, I am disquieted with inward anguishes.  And herew
                     •
                  th my enemies multiply, and tumult against me; not so much to ouer beare me (for that is effected to their hands) as to insult ouer mee. Their insolent insulting doth much increase the sense of my miseries; It is no lesse grieuous to mee, then my miseries themselues. Whatsoeuer either heart or hope my miseries haue left, the same by the insolence of mine enemies is beaten downe. To lie prostrate vnder thy heauie hand, is a heauie case; to be depriued of the poorest comfort of calamitie, pitie, is a  very pitifull state indeede; naturally we desire, if wee cannot be relieued, yet to be pitied: but to be despised and despited in our miseries, to see men so farre from pitie, that they take pleasure at our deiection, what can be said or suffred more? Assuredlie, not calamities, not death it selfe, is so grieuous to a free ingenuous mind, as is derision and despite.
               
                   Now, this being the condition of my case, What rigour wilt thou further vse? What sad seueritie will

thy anger further execute vpon me? What? wilt thou exercise thy strength against so deiected a person? Against a worme? against a leafe? against a shadow? against nothing? Will a Giant make proofe of his prowesse against a Gnat? Or if he do, shall he euer attaine glorie by his atchieuement? Consider, O LORD, first my troubles, then both the multitude and malice of mine enemies, and then see in what sort it may best beseeme thy Almightie Maiestie to deale with me.
               For, as generallie sinne is the first cause of hostilitie  and hate;Gen. 3.15. as enmitie is the curse of sinne
                     •
                   as by sinne man hath lost, not onelie the obedience of other creatures, but amitie both among themselues, and within their owne bosomes: so my particular sinnes haue stirred such s
                     •
                  ore of enemies against me, that I account my selfe of all men most forsaken and forlorne. I haue offended the LORD and Creator of all things, and haue thereby incurred the hostilitie of all creatures; all creatures in his quarrell are in Armes against me. Nothing doth take my part, nothing doth comfort me, all things are violentlie bent to oppresse me. Mine ancient enemies haue doubled, both in malice and in power; manie doe dailie adioine vnto them; my kindred and kinde friendes grow strange. No man but either openlie or secretlie setteth himselfe to pursue mee; some with despite, others with derision and scorne, the residue with forgetfulnesse or contempt. Yea, mine owne conscience most sharpelie pursues me, my most secret thoughts mutine within me; abroad and at home I can find no peace.
               
                  For this cause I haue composed my voice to the tunes of mourning, I haue cast downe my countenance with trembling and shame; all my behauiour is attired in the vnlouelie liuerie of sadnesse. I goe as one vnseene, or vnknowne, or vnregarded; I walke as senslesse of any thing but onely of sorrow. I haue not onely neglected, but euill intreated my filthie flesh, for conspiring to betray my soule to the slauery of sinne; for drawing my soule downe into hell, which should haue soared vp with my flesh into heauen.
               
                  
                  Flesh
                        •
                     , thou corrupt case of flesh and bloud; wherin my soule is pent, as a prisoner in a loathsome Iaile. Thou hast shamefully abused and abased that guest, which hath hitherto supported thee, hitherto preserued thee from putrefaction and stincke. I haue therefore challenged the combat of thee, I am fully resolued to beat thee downe. I will also complaine of thee to the omnipotent Iudge, in the high Court of his Starre Chamber; I will prooue thee a deceiuer, a traitor; I will prooue thee a combiner, a riotour with the world and the Deuill: I will proue thee a forger of false assurances.
               
                   Alasse! there is left in me, neither beautie to be enuied, nor strength to be feared. I am sunke so low, as there needeth now a strong hand to raise me, great power and goodnesse to restore me. VVhat wilt thou do more against me? VVilt thou also presse me downe with thine Almighty arme? But the noble nature of a Lion will not hurt the beast that falleth prostrate before him. And doublesse, the more a man

is endued both with magnanimity and power; the more prone is he, not only to forbeare, but to erect and relieue those that are deiected. For true valour and compassion are alwaies chained together. And therfore thou who art most magnanimous, must also of ne
                     •
                  essity be most compassionate; Thou who art most powerfull and most magnanimious; must also of necessity bee most inclinable, most forward, most desirous to saue.
               O my GOD! whose pitie is equall to thy power;  I am a most miserable forlorne creature: I know it right well, I acknowledge it to thee: Shew now vpon mee thy pitifull power; not onely in sparing, but in sauing me. In this let thy power be knowen: for this let mee glorifie thy name. Deale with mee as thou diddest with those who did foolishly tempt thee; whom thou diddest saue for thy name,
                  
                     Et saluauit propter nomen suum, vt notam fatoret potentiam suam.
                   
                  that thy power might be knowne. For assuredly, thy power may now be shewn more by relieuing, then by further oppressing; thy power shall this way work to thy greatest praise. This will best beseeme thy most excellent Maiestie, this is most agreeable to the greatnesse of thy power; this is most agreeable to the goodnesse of thy will; this will best sort to the glorie of thy Name.

                  BVT loe, this stiffe storme is suddenly blowne ouer: the tempest which did driue so bitterlie in my face, is suddenlie turned to a quiet calme: the cloudes of displeasure which were wrapped about my head, are broken and dispersed; and the sweet Sunshine of mercie hath cleered her comfortable beames vpon me. GOD is now appeased with me; he hath now changed his countenance towards me; and yet remaineth immutable in himselfe. For as naturall causes worke according to the disposition of the subiect (as the same Sunne hardeneth Clay, and melteth Waxe; comforteth some bodies, and scorcheth others) So the cause of all causes, being alwaies one, worketh diuerslie in vs, accordingly as wee are differentlie disposed towards him.
               Come hither now all yee that are oppressed with  griefe; I will tell you that which you will hardlie beleeue. In a darke Dungeon I haue found Paradice; in sorrow, ioy; in trouble, tranquillitie and rest; in want, abundance; in despaire, hope; in trembling and feare, assurance and strength. All this you will hardly beleeue, yet all this hath the sweet hand of the LORD effected for me Loe, he that was once far off, is now present; I embrace him whom once I could not see; he that could not be found, is now discouered, hath now approached. He hath comforted me, he hath cured me, he hath ministred strength and courage to me.
               
                  
                   And therefore, Away from me all ye workers of iniquitie: I will haue nothing to doe with you: your iniquity is contagious, it shall not come neere me, I am now reconciled to GOD, I am restored to his friendship: I will no more bee familiar with you, I can take no pleasure in your societie. I am newly cleansed, I will not defile my selfe with your impure conuersation; your wickednesse shall haue no opportunitie to vndermine my weakenes. If a building be weak, and the walls decline, a smal force is su

                  ficient to prostrate it to the ground. But our weake nature detorted from originall Iustice, and much empaired by frequencie of sinne, is alwaies prone and enclinable to euill: the Imagination of mans heart is euill euen from his youth.
                  Gen. 8.21. And therefore I will auoid all outward occasions that may attract me to euill; among which, familiar conuersing with euill men is the chiefe.
                     Cum sancto sanctus eris, & cum peruerso peruerteris. Psa. 18.25. For if two contraries be applied together, the stronger must necessarilie destroy the weaker. But as we are more enclinable to vice then to vertue; so vice is more strong in the wicked, then vertue in the good: whereby it followeth, that the societie of euill men is most dangerous to the good; and that as an hundred sound men shall sooner take the plague from one infected person,

                        um, Num. 10. then he recouer his health by them; so the good are more often peruerted by the wicked, then the wicked conuerted by the good.
               For this cause GOD loueth nor to see his children among the wicked. For this cause hee commanded his people that they should not ioyne in marriage with the Gentiles. Exo. 34. For this cause also he

commaunded them to destroy the inhabitants of the countrey, which they were to possesse; lest by societie in their conuersation,Num. 33. Psal. 105. they should be drawne into societie of their sinnes; as afterwards they were indeed. Elihu marueiled at Iob;Iob 31. Phil. 2. and the Apostle at the Philippians, that among the wicked they could liue well. Lot who liued in Sodome,Gen. 19. needed the hand of an Angel to draw him foorth. Saint Peter being in the company of the other Apostles, confessed the LORD to be the Sonne of GOD: but denied him in Caiphas house, when he stood among the wicked by the fire.Matth. 26. GOD commanded that no man should touch any creature that was vncleane;Deut. 15. and that whosoeuer touched a dead body, he shoud be vncleane. But no creature is so vncleane as a sinner: no death is like to the death of sinne.
               And therefore I will auoid wicked men, as the most vncleane of liuing creatures, and the most loathsome of those that are dead. I will not regard either kindred or kind acquaintance;
                     Semper aliquid mali propter vicinum malū
                     
                   I will esteeme all the wicked alike. I will cast off my neere friends; I will pull out my eyes, I will cut off my hands, rather then they shall draw me to euill.
               I will rather liue in desarts and caues,Matth. 26. rather with dragons and vipers,
                     Qui tetigerit picem inquinabitur obea. Eccles. 13. then in the society of those that are euill. I will not touch these pitchy companions, I will not in the least matters haue to deale with them. If a small rupture in a bancke be not timelie stopped, it will weare greater, and all the valley will be surrownded thereby.Esay 14.

               But as a man who standeth vpon firme ground will cast foorth boords and lines to saue such as are in danger of drowning, and yet will not approach so neere as to be drowned with them: so I will affoord the wicked what helpes I can, for their safety; but will haue an eie that they fasten not vpon mee, that they draw me not into their destruction.
               
                   Away from me also all yee mine enemies, who intend any wickednesse against mee: take away your malice, for your mischiefe is at an end. The LORD is now at peace with me, hee hath put vp the sword of his iustice, he hath giuen to me his mercifull hand. In vaine shall you now either attempt against mee, or insult ouer me: It is not onely vanity, but iniquity which now you shall contriue against me. You shall neuer effect your euill intentions. Hate me you may, but harme me you cannot. You shall neuer preuaile against him, who hath preuailed against the Almighty.
               
                   My teares haue ouercome the Omnipotent, the voice of my teares hath vanquished the inuincible. These luke-warme droppes haue quenched GODS anger, qualified his iustice, recouered his mercy, won

his loue. True teares are the language of heauen; they speake strongly to GOD, he heareth them well. No voice hath more free and familiar accesse to him; none is more acceptable, none better vnderstood. Hee who often regardeth not the voice of the tongue, will alwaies heare the voice of our teares. The voice of the tongue is framed in the mouth, but the voice of teares proceeds from a heart, surprised either with ioy or with griefe. Hee who regardeth onely the heart, doth much regard this language of the heart. Therefore in all the anguishes of my soule, I will vse few words heereafter, but powre forth my sorrow in silent teares; whensoeuer I sin, I will write my supplication for pardon with teares: whensoeuer I would obtaine any curtesie or fauour from GOD, I will addresse my desire with teares. Teares are too mighty Orators to let any suit fall. When teares crie vnto GOD, when hee is importuned by teares, he will presently grow familiar with vs. They haue so perswading a silence, so conquering a complaint; that by entreating they command, by yeelding they ouercome. When they seeme most pitifull, then are they most powerfull: when they seeme most forsaken, then are they most victorious.
               This dew of deuotion neuer falleth, but it is an  assured signe of a beautifull day; euen of GODS fauour to cleere vpon vs. Vpon what face soeuer it droppeth, it maketh the same amiable in the eies of GOD. I will not therefore giue ouer my weeping, my face must bee still adorned with these liquid pearles, the Angels shall still bathe themselues in

these streames of my eies: vntill death damme vp the springs they shall not cease running.
               
                   But heerein vse some caution (O my soule) for, that thy teares may be profitable, that they may be more acceptable to GOD, they must not proceede from a softnesse and tendernesse of nature:Powre out your hearts before him. Ps. 62.8. but thou must powre foorth thy very heart in teares. They must not proceed from any worldly respect, not from feare of death or of hell, not absolutely from loue of thy selfe: but from loue towards GOD, and from griefe for offending so good a Father, so great a Lord, so pure a perfection and glorie. This loue is the fire, wherwith these siluer drops are melted in the furnace; wherewith the flowers of deuotion and grace are distilled into teares. This loue is the sun which resolueth dark pitchie clouds into raine, which resolueth thicke foggie mists into dew, and maketh the ayre pleasant and cleere. Without this loue, teares are nothing but excrementall water; they are nothing worth if they be not warmed and melted with this heat of loue. For as water taken from pits and welles vpon the earth, is not so fruitfull to make hearbes thriue, as raine water which falleth from heauen; Insomuch as some plants growing in the middest of waters, will wither and die for want of raine: so teares which proceede from terrene respects, make not the soule so flourishing and fruitfull in grace, as teares which fall for the loue of GOD. Such were the teares of the sinfull woman, who watered her masters feet with her teares, who with the teares of her body cleansed her soule. For to her many sinnes were forgiuen, not principally

in regard of her teares, but because shee loued much.
               
            
            
               
                  
                     VERS. IX.
                     The LORD hath heard my petition: the LORD will receiue my prayer.
                  
               
               
                  
                     1 HOW easie GOD is to heare and to pardon.
                     
                     2. No sooner can wee dispose our selues to aske, but wee receiue from GOD some taste of his fauour.
                     
                     3. Wherefore sometimes GOD deferreth for a time.
                     
                     4. Inequality betweene GODS disposition and ours.
                     
                     6. The trophee of repentant Teares.
                     
                     7. Our miseries turned to medicines.
                     
                     8. The world how to be esteemed.
                     
                     9. The experience of GODS liberality and loue, what it worketh.
                     
                     10. Experience surmounteth reason.
                     
                     
                        11 The condition of our assurance.
                     
                     12. When GOD cannot be intreated.
                     
                     13. What giueth wings to our prayers, what weigheth them downe.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  O Incredible clemency and mercy! How commeth it, O LORD, that thou art so ready to heare vs? so easie to pardon vs? did my sorrow sit so neere thy heart? wert thou so stricken with the wounds of my soule, by seeing them bleed so fast at mine eyes? Thou hast now finished my feares, assured my hopes, perfected my ioyes, satisfied my desires. Oh! how good is the LORD? Is any like vnto the most high? who comforteth the afflicted, healeth the wounded, reuiueth the dead? Is any other like vnto him? Learne, O ye feeble soules! how amiable the LORD is; how mercifull, how mild; how hee visiteth his seruants, how hee neuer disdayneth to impart himselfe to them.
               
                   Scarce, O LORD, can we dispose our selues to craue forgiuenesse, scarce open our lips, scarse addresse our selues to sue to thee for mercy; but we receiue some taste of thy fauour. When we are comming to thee slowly and farre off, thou runnest to meete vs; thou embracest vs in the armes of thy loue, thou giuest vs the comfortable kisses of peace.  Or if thou doest deferre thy comfort and consolations for a time, it is to send them in greater abūdance; it is that the long absence thereof, with little hope,

and great desire, should make thy presence the more esteemed. O infinite inequality betweene my disposition  and thine! I am rash in offending thee, and thou art ready to remit mine offences: I runne apace to dishonour thee, and thou hastest more fast to receiue me to grace. I haue searched all places, euen the bottome of the sea, euen the bowels of the earth, to minister foment and food to my sensuall desires: And when these pleasures had poysoned my soule, when I was in a maze of troubles, vnder a Masse of dangers; when I was at the very point to perish, in a moment thou diddest pierce the heauens, and come downe for my deliuerance. Thou diddest not only deliuer me and set me free, but thou diddest comfort and reuiue my languishing soule; euen as a hot Bath refresheth the limbs of a poore tired traueller.
               Behold now the Trophee of my repentant teares;  see how my sorrow triumpheth ouer my sinnes. My hope, which was weighed downe with the leaden plumets of sinne, is now at liberty, now full of liuely courage and ioy. The LORD hath heard my petition. I haue not sorrowed and prayed in vaine; I haue obtained pardon, I haue receiued grace; he hath not been strange of his fauour, he hath not been sparing of his mercy towards me. All my former discomforts  and miseries are turned to the nature of medicines. They haue been like bitter Pils to purge superfluous and corrupt humors; they haue been like Aloes and VVormewood, to weane me from the tea
                     •
                  es of this world. O world! which hast bewitched so many, blinded so many; Thou wert nothing at thy beginning,

thy light is but a shadow, thou art but a smoke in thy greatest height; in shew somewhat, but in substance nothing. Thou art sweet to fooles, thou art either bitter, or without rellish to wise men. VVhosoeuer loueth thee, neuer knew thee; whosoeuer knoweth thee, doth either loath or contemne thee.
               
                   And because now I haue large experience both of the liberality and loue of GOD; I will not hereafter be dismayed, I will not be discouraged: I will assume assurance, that whensoeuer I call vpon him, the LORD will receiue my prayer. Albeit, I see nothing but punishments, and the worst of punishments, feares: albeit I finde no comfort, yet will I hope. I will rather thinke that all my sences are mistaken, then faile in hope; I will first let goe my life, before I will let goe my hope. My reason may be vanquished, but by experience is stronger then reason, my experience cannot be ouercome.
               
                   Approued experience will not be encountered by reason, it prescribeth rules and limits to reason, it is guided by no Law but by it selfe: It hath armed me against all despaires, discouragements, or distrusts. Albeit reason may discourse, that I haue so often prouoked the wrath of GOD, and wearied his patience, that he cannot but now reiect my prayer; yet experience doth warrant mine infirmity, that the goodnesse of GOD is such, that whatsoeuer petitions and importunities I offer, he will neuer be weary to heare them, neuer vnwilling to grant them: that the more we draw of this fountaine, the fuller are the

waters, and the sweeter their taste.
               All this is vnder one condition, if wee abandon our  sinne. For onely our sinne, onely our perseuerance in sinne doeth hinder the approach of our prayers to GOD.
               GOD is neuer inexorable, but when man is incorrigible;  when man will not be amended, then cannot GOD bee entreated. Wee haue sinned,
                  Though you make many prayers, I will not heare: for your hands are full of blood. Wash you cleane, & though your sins were as crimson, they shall be white as snow. Esay 1.15. &c.
                   
                  and prouoked thee to wrath; therefore thou hast couered thy selfe with a cloud, that our prayers should not passe through. Lam. 3. For when we come to entreate him, armed, with those weapons wherewith wee did offend him; when our hearts are bathed in vncleannesse, when our hands smoke with the blood of our sinnes; how should he heare our prayers? how should he not abhorre them? So long as the broken Iron remaineth in a wound, it is but a vaine labour to applie plaisters to cure it. Of no greater force a
                     •
                  e our prayers, and all other religious actions or endeauours, so long as sinne remaineth in the wounds of our will, so long as the pleasure of sinne sticketh fast in our purposes and desires. For as we can neuer qualifie our thirst with drinke, whilest our stomacke is stuffed with such bilious humours, as by drinking enflame the greater thirst; so our soules shall neuer bee refreshed with the goodnesse and mercie of GOD, whilest it is full of the poysonous purpose of sinne.
               Such a soule is a soile, which the more dewe it receiueth, the more weedes it bringeth forth. But if wee be grieued for our sinnes; If we groane vnder their weight, if we wrestle against their malice and power;

albeit the clouds were of Iron, and the heauens of brasse, our penitent praiers will pierce them. The  LORD will receiue our prayers. Verelie, a religious life giueth spirituall wings to our prayers; It maketh them flie like lightning to the presence of GOD. But 
                     •
                  inne weigheth them downe; and so much the more, by how much the more our life is reprooueable.
            
            
               
                  
                     VERS. X.
                     All mine enemies shall be confounded and sore vexed: they shall be turned backe, and put to shame suddenly.
                  
               
               
                  
                     1 OVR enemies shall bee confounded, and how.
                     
                     2. The wicked when chiefly vexed at the prosperity of the godly.
                     
                     3. They shall be extreamely confounded at the mercy of GOD, and wherefore.
                     
                     4. Delay in sinne, maketh the conuersion to grace more hard.
                     
                     
                        5. GOD turneth to the wicked and to the godly in a different sort.
                     
                     6. A short prayer.
                     
                     7. How sinners must seeke.
                     
                     8. And what they shall finde.
                     
                     9. A resolution not to stay one houre in sin.
                     
                  
               
               
                  AND what now shall mine enemies  doe? They shall bee altogether confounded: First, with vexation at my happy estate; afterwards, with shame at their owne repulse, at their sudden ouerthrow, at their perpetuall deiection. They shall be anguished to see their hopes and expectations faile; to see my misery changed to felicity; to see their iniury so much the more cruell, because vniust, turne to my honour; to see him whom they thought to ruinate, whom they had fully destined to death, more highly aduanced then euer hee was before.
               They are generally vexed with the prosperous condition of any man; but more especially if hee be  godly, but most grieuously if they professe to prosecute him with open hate. The prosperity of such a man is more grieuous to them, then their owne calamitie. But when they shall further see, that he hath not onely auoided their attempts, but preuailed against them; that the omnipotent arme of the LORD dasheth them downe; that mountaines of misery do ouerwhelme them; the more apparant their fall shall

be to all men, the more shamefull will it bee to themselues.
               
                   And further, the exceeding mercy and goodnesse of GOD, shall extremely confound them. For the more gracious and mercifull the LORD is, in hearing and receiuing sinners, the more they shall be confounded, if they continue obstinate in their euill, if they will not repent and turne vnto him.
               They shall be confounded (I say) because when they nothing doubt of the goodnesse of GOD, yet do they either not esteeme it, or suppose to haue it at pleasure and will. For nothing shall more confound sinners, then that knowing, as well the riches of GODS mercies,
                     Accedite ad me & illuminamini, & facies vestrae non confundentur. Psal. 34. as his gracious goodnesse; which openeth to all, which inuiteth all, which intreateth all to participate therof; Yet they remaine either altogether carelesse, or heauy and dull in comming to him: they either proudly contemne, or with  false flateries and hopes delay to repent; which the longer they deferre, the more incapable are they made of Grace.
               For as a brand newly quenched, will readily take fire, but the longer it remaineth extinguished, the more hardly can it be kindled againe; so in a sinner, the first decaying and dying of grace may easily be quickened; but the longer he continueth dead in sin, the harder will he be reuiued to Grace.
               Alas! they ioyed at my griefe, and iested at my groning; they made themselues merry with my misery, and built the trophees of their victory vpon my ruines and disgrace. They did swim in the delights

of this world, whilest I bathed my selfe with teares, whilest I chastised and euill entreated my rebellious flesh: But now (Oh shame!) they shall be turned to  another straine. Their ioy shall be turned to smart and sorrow, their pride to contempt, their insolencie to ignominie and reproach. And as the LORD hath sodainely turned his fauour to me, so his fury shall sodainely be turned to them. The wrath of the LORD like a sodaine tempest will strike in their faces; It will astonish them, it will cast them downe, it will consume them.
               
                  Before thunder goeth lightning (saith the wiseman) and no lesse truely may it be said,Eccles. 22.11. that after lightning commeth thunder. What is lightning but the flashes of pleasure in this life? beautifull, but short. The pleasures of this life are like the momentary flashes of lightning; sodainely gone, and seruing for nothing but to increase the terrour of ensuing darkenes. And the more bright the lightning is, the more deepe is the darkenesse, the more dreadfull the thunder which is sodainely to ensue.
               Assuredly they shall be turned indeed. For if they will not turne vnto thee, thou wilt turne them to confusion and shame.
               O most mercifull, most iust GOD! most powerfull, most prone and ready to helpe. How louing a Father art thou to forsaken Orphanes? how fauourable a Iudge to distressed sinners? how sure a friend to those who loue thee, to those who trust in thee? They shall finde thee liberall aboue their deserts, aboue the highest of their desires: a measurer of thy

gifts, not by their worthinesse; but by thine owne goodnesse. Come hither all feeble sinners, whose consciences are afraid of your owne suspicions, who euer thinke you shall be damned: come learne of me what sinners may find, and how sinners must seeke; learne by my affections to obtaine the like effects.
               
                   Rise earelie in the morning of thy good motions, let them not sleepe too long in sloath: Search thine owne soule diligently; let faith bee thine eye, hope thy guide, loue thy light; search whether thou canst finde the LORD within thee. If thou findest him not there; If thou findest that thy sinnes haue chased him away; laie thy soule vpon the racke of repentance. Wring groanes from thy heart, and teares from thine eyes; stretch it from heauen to earth, vntill perforce thou force it to cry, O GOD! Feare no encounters for GOD, out of GOD desire no comforts: let the desire of him either extinguish or ouerrule the desire of all other things.
               
                   Whosoeuer cannot finde GOD; hee doeth not thus seeke him: whosoeuer hath not the like ioy to mine, he neuer had the like sorrow and desire.
               
                   As for me, who feele my selfe freed from this both pressing and piercing weight, from this loathsome load of sinne; who feele my selfe cheered with the liuelie light of grace; I will not remaine hereafter one houre in sinne, one houre in the hatred of my Creator. I will forget all things, and among them my selfe▪ and thinke of him who thus hath saued me. As the highest heauen draweth all the inferiour with the sway thereof, albeit they haue naturally a

contrary course; so my reason enabled by grace, shall draw all my appetites, the whole frame of my inward man; albeit they haue properly a contrary inclination. Gracious GOD! addresse all the instruments of my voice to sing praises to thee; instruct all the faculties of my mind to loue thee, to feare thee, to place my full felicitie in the knowledge and obedience of thy will.
               
                  Praise, and glorie, and wisedome, and strength,
dominion, riches, and power, bee vnto our
GOD for euermore.
               
            
            
               
               
               A SVMMARY PRAYER.
               
                  OMnipotent and eternall GOD! whose iustice cannot suffer sinnes vnpunished; whose mercy would not suffer sinnes vnpardoned: I beseech thee, so to moderate thy scourges with mercy, that I may bee able to abide them. For if thou openest the floud-gates

of thy fury vpon me, the force therof must needes ouer-beare mee, and driue me downe headlong to death. I know, O LORD, that thy chastisements are necessary for vs in this life; I decline them not; I craue no forbearance at thy hand; I rather craue that thou wilt not forbeare me. Deale heerein according to thy wisedome, not to my will; not as shall bee most for mine ease, but as thou esteemest best for my good. This onely I desire; that in all thy punishments, I may not finde thee an angry Iudge, but a most kinde and carefull Fa
                     •
                  her; that thou wilt correct mee, but not giue mee ouer to death;Ps. 118.18. That I may finde both comfort and strength in thy stripes: and that as thy rodde doeth chastice me,
                     Thy 
                           〈◊〉
                         & thy staffe comfort me. Ps. 23.4.
                  
so thy staffe may sustaine mee.
               For I am weake, O Almighty GOD I am so weake that I am altogether vnable either not to deserue thy wrath, or to endure it. My offences haue proceeded from my weakenesse, and they againe haue made mee more weake: they haue made so many mortall woundes in my soule, that I approach neere vnto death. I languish vnder my imminent danger, my owne putrefaction is loathsome to my selfe; and the very sight of thy frowne doeth terribly torment mee. My weake soule is so ouercharged, both with feare and with griefe; that it can neither lift vp it selfe, nor quietly lie still: neither lift vp it selfe against the power of thy wrath, nor

lie still vnder the weight thereof; more horriblie heauie then the flaming Mountaine Aetna. But haue mercy vpon mee and heale mee, O gracious LORD! O my GOD! open to me the ouer-flowing Fountaine of thy euer-flowing mercy; from whence alwayes streame, both the safe, and present, and onely remedy against the malice and maladies of sinne. If thou doe not this, I am vndone; I must presently perish. I am so farre from standing against thy wrath, that my owne weakenesse will draw me downe.
               Ah my GOD! wherefore doest thou so long hold backe thy helpe? Wherefore hast thou cut off thy comforts from me? Wherefore art thou so angry? Wherefore so seuere?

Wilt thou turne away thy face foreuer? Returne, O most mercifull Father! for thy infinite mercies sake, I beseech thee, returne to thy accustomed clemency again. Turne to mee the appeased eyes of thy mercy, let mee againe beholde thy gracious & quiet countenance, which my offences haue caused thee to turne away. Deliuer my soule from these miseries; deliuer it from the importable burthen, both of thy seuerity and of my sinnes. Saue me, for I lie quaking vnder the cruell gripes of destruction: Saue mee, LORD, or of necessity I must perish. Which if I doe, if vnseasonable death seaze vpon mee; then shall I no more prayse thy Name, then shall I neuer make a thankefull

memoriall of thy blessed benefits. But giue me, O good Father! time to repent: as thou hast giuen mee a purpose to prayse thee, so giue mee power and opportunity for the same. If needes thou wilt exercise the rigour of thy Iustice; why then doe it vpon those whose hearts are hardened with obstinate impiety, who willingly and wilfully perseuere in their sinnes; who are nothing touched, either with reuerence of thy Maiesty, or with regard of their owne safety. But I heauily labour vnder the load of my sinnes; I refuse not to vndergoe the hard taske of repentance for them. It displeaseth me much, that euer I displeased thy Maiesty by my sinnes: my grieuous sinnes torment and teare the

most inward sences of my soule: they are most grieuous, most intolerable to me. This is not vnknown to thee, who knowest our secrets better then our selues. This appeareth by the sad groanes which break frō my pained soule: this appeareth by the plenty of teares, which my heart boyling in anguish and griefe, doeth euaporate and distill through the conduicts of my eyes. But especially this appeareth, by the vnlouely state of my body; which is become like a withered weed; so wasted with sorrow, that it hath neither beauty to please others, nor strength to sustaine it selfe.
               But howsoeuer it is with me, I will neuer lay downe my hope; I will neuer despaire or distrust in thy

mercies. I haue alwaies had so good triall of thy fauourable hearing, of thy liberall reliefe; that in all my temptations, in all the anguishes of my soule, I will rest vpon thy goodnesse and grace; with assured confidence, that thou wilt heare my prayer: if not so soone as I desire, yet at such time as shall be most expedient for me. For oftentimes it is more expedient that I should be exercised for a time, then presently eased. I will also rest assured, that my malicious enemies, who vniustly work or wish my destruction, shall neuer preuaile against mee. That their Counsailes shall bee confounded, their practises disappointed, and themselues turned to ignominy and reproach.

                     6 I said, I will confesse my sinnes vnto the LORD: and so thou forgauest the wickednesse of my sinne.
                  
                     7 For this shall euery one that is godly make his prayer vnto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: but in the great water floods they shall not come nigh him.
                  
                     8 Thou art a place to hide mee in, thou shalt preserue me from trouble: thou shalt compasse mee about with songs of deliuerance.
                  
                     9 I will informe thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt goe:

and I will guide thee with mine eye.

               Of the title and parts of this PSALME.
               
                  1 THe title of this Psalme and the reason thereof.
                  
                  2 All worldly knowledges are both troublesome and imperfect.
                  
                  3 The excellency of the knowledge of GOD.
                  
                  4 We are most ignorant of our selues.
                  
                  5 Wherefore this word know thy selfe, was written

vpon the gates of Apolloes Temple.
                  
                  6 How excellent and difficult it is to know our selues.
                  
                  7 The good which GOD worketh out of our sinnes.
                  
                  8 He that is sinfull and secure is doubly miserable.
                  
                  9 Some things are absoultely good, but nothing absolutely euill.
                  
                  10 The LORD is sayd to bee a hard man, and wherefore.
                  
                  11 The appellation and parts of this Psalme.
                  
               
            
            
               THIS is the second penitentiall  Psalme, intitled by some, The vnderstanding; by others, The instruction of Dauid. Partly for that he instructed others therby, but chiefllie, for that he declared that he had receiued instruction, and was brought to vnderstand both GOD and himselfe: Which is the perfectiō of all other as wel diuine as humane knowledge.  Other knowledges bring an endlesse labour to the minde; because the more we know, the more we are desirous to know: But they doe not pacifie the debates, they doe not cure the diseases that are within vs. They make a man learned, but not good; skilfull, but not wise. I say more. They doe but make a man know how little he knowes; because all our knowledge consisteth in knowing our ignorance: and the most that a man can know of any Science in this world, is but the least part of that, whereof he is ignorant.
            
               But the knowledge of GOD, is the foundation of our Spirituall building; the first wheele of the clocke;  the first moueable spheare, which causeth the motion of all the rest. We are created in this world, to the end that we should serue GOD: But wee cannot serue him, vnlesse we loue him, vnlesse also wee feare him; and we can neither loue nor feare him vnlesse we know him▪ euen as some rurall people haue not onely not honoured, but rudely intreated their Prince, comming by aduenture and vnknowen among them. But it is not sufficient to beleeue that there is a GOD, to haue a confused knowledge of him; vnlesse we know what he is to vs, & what we are to him: vnles we put of our shooes, that is al worldly affections, GOD wil not manifest himselfe to vs.
            
               But this done the knowledge of his goodnes will make vs to loue him; of his Iustice, to feare him; of his Maiestie, to honour him; of his Mercie, to hope in him; of his Wisedome, to obey him. My eye seeth thee (saith Iob) and therefore I repent in dust and ashes.
               Iob. 42. As the Philistines did first put out Sampsons eyes, and then tooke him forth to sport with him: so the diuell first laboureth, either to extinguish, or to shadow this our Spiritual fight, & then playeth at pleasure with vs.
            
            And now againe, Albeit nothing bee so neere vs as our selues; yet the knowledge of our selues is furthest from vs. There is nothing almost that wee lesse vnderstand, then our selues. For as our bodily eyes behold other obiects, but not themselues; so the eye of our minde, namely our vnderstanding, is apt to apprehend other things, but not it selfe. It is nimble to

discouer, strong and bold to iudge other matters; but is defectiue both in sight to discerne, and in iudgement to esteeme it selfe: For this cause the ancient Philosophers affirme, that this voice 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; Know thy selfe;  was first sounded from heauen. For this cause it was written in golden letters, vpon the doore of Apollo's Temple; either because it is proper onely to GOD; or because it is the highest wisedome whereto man can aspire; or because it is the onely entrance to the knowledge and seruice of GOD. For albeit GOD may be seene in all his creatures, yet especially in our selues who beare his Image. Thou seekest GOD abroad, but enter the secret chambers of thy soule, and there he may most readily be found. The better thou knowest thy selfe, the better thou knowest GOD; because the knowledge of thy selfe will lead thee to the knowledge of GOD.
            
                Assuredly no knowledge is more high, none more hard and hidden then the knowledge of our selues: 
                  
                     •
                  f I were perfect (saith Iob) yet know I not my owne soule.
               Iob. 21. Man hath no brighter glasse, no learneder booke to looke on then himselfe. The true studie of man is man: All other knowledge without this is defectiue. Hee that spendeth his spirits to attaine the knowledge of other things, and neuer collecteth them to search, know and iudge himselfe, remaines the most sencelesse Sott in the world. Other knowledge puffeth vp: but this humbleth and pulleth downe. For hum
                  •
               litie is nothing else but a true contempt of our selues, which proceedeth from the knowledge of our selues: so as the knowledge of

our selues is the forme of humilitie, and consequently of all other vertues which are deriued from humilitie.
            And this great benefite did the mercie of GOD bring to Dauid, by reason of his sinne; To vnderstand his owne weakenesses and wants; to vnderstand by whom he must be supported in the one, and supplied in the other; To vnderstand (I say) both GOD and himselfe. The fall of Dauid did extinguish in him all puffie pride; it shaked vp his sensuall, or rather sencelesse securitie; it made him neuer to presume vpon his owne strength; but in all temptations and afflictions, to trust truely to the power and goodnesse of GOD; and to hope for no helpe, no stay, but onely from his all-powerfull grace. Hee that is sinfull and yet secure, is doubly miserable; miserable in his sinne, but more miserable in his securitie. And thus GOD neuer suffereth euill but for some great and secret good; euen as Moses had said:
                  Vt sugeret mel de petra, & oleum de saxo durissimo.
                
               He caused him to sucke honie out of the rocke, and oyle out of the hardest stone. O the infinite wisedome and power of GOD! out of the drie and ragged rocke of our sinnes,Deut. 32.13. hee draweth the sweet sappe of humilitie from vs, and of mercie from himselfe; to the sweet safetie and felicitie of our  soules. Assuredly, some things may bee so good, as that they haue no mixture of euill: yet nothing can be so absolutely euill, but some good ariseth from it.
            And hence it is that the LORD calleth himselfe a  hard-man; who reapeth where he did not sow, and gathereth where he did not disperse. But,
                  Quiadurus homo sum, &c. Matth. 25 most righteous and vpright LORD! How standeth this with the square

of Iustice? It is hard indeed; but how is it iust? to reap where thou didst not sow, & gather where thou diddest not disperse? Verely, thou sowest not the seeds of our sinnes; our sinnes are the tares which the Diuell soweth among the wheate: and yet thou reapest out of them, both good to thy seruants, and glorie to thy selfe. By our sinnes thou doest bring vs to vnderstand our selues, and to search after thee: to know our owne exceeding weakenesse and miserie, and to acknowledge thine infinite goodnesse, wisedome and power: to abandon and renounce the one, & to trust entirely to the other.
            Now this Psalme is most fitly termed a Penitentiall  Psalme: because it treateth chiefely of Repentance. The parts are set forth in the Table next adioyning.

                        The power and dignity of repentance, in that it maketh a man blessed, ver. 1.

                     VERS. I.
                     Blessed is he whose vnrighteousnesse is forgiuen: and whose sinne is couered.
                  
               
               
                  
                     1 RIches, honour, power, &c. make not men happy by their owne nature.
                     
                     2 Because they doe not satisfie.
                     
                     3 Because they are deceitfull.
                     
                     4 Because they are inconstant.
                     
                     5 They make not Blessed in regard of indisposition in our selues.
                     
                     6 How they are blessings, and to whom.
                     
                     7 How and to whom they are heauy curses.
                     
                     8 Worldly matters more often hinder then helpe for attayning felicity.
                     
                     9 Who onely is blessed in this life.
                     
                     10 Whether it be not a greater Blessednesse not to sinne, then to haue sinne pardoned.
                     
                     11 Wherefore happinesse consists in forgiuenesse of sinnes.
                     
                     
                        12 Another reason.
                     
                     13 The difference betweene the blessednesse of Saints in heauen, and of repentant sinners vpon earth.
                     
                     14 Forgiuenesse of sinne is no ordinarie blessing, and wherefore.
                     
                     15 It is a very great blessing to haue our sinnes couered, and wherefore.
                     
                     16 How hard it is to hide sinne, and wherefore.
                     
                     17 Onely repentance couereth sinne, and wherfore.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  WHom may we esteeme blessed in this life? The rich? the honourable? the mighty? the politicke and wise? Alasse! miserable are they who esteeme themselues happy, by being any or all of these. There is neither trust nor taste in these false felicities; whether we regard their owne nature, or whether many indispositions in our selues.
               
                   In their proper nature, they doe not satisfie, vntill they cloy; there is alwayes somewhat wanting in them, vntill they ouercharge vs with boysterous abundance; and then they satisfie least of all. If any solid goodnesse were in them, then would they in some degree satisfie. All other things giue some satisfaction; drinke quencheth thirst, meat appeaseth hunger, apparell expelleth cold: but these are so far from quieting the desire, that they make it more vnrestfull and stirring. They are a dropsie; they are a dogges appetite; they may fill, but they neuer satisfie,

vntill they haue made vs like drunkards the next day after a riotous feast; dull and heauy, vnable to speake or thinke of our surfet without loathing.
               Againe, they are deceitfull; fayrer in shew, then in  substance they are found; they seeme better to those who want them, then to those who enioy them; they promise many pleasures, but they come clogged with innumerable cares. They make vs liue in wishing and in repenting; in wishing the future, and repenting somewhat that is past; in loathing what wee haue tasted, and longing for that which we desire; in vaine remembring what is gone, and doubtfull expecting what is to ensue. As for euery present, it is like a waue, one alwayes dashing and driuing forth the other.
               Lastly, they are not constant; for they often  leaue vs: they are not of continuance, for certainely we must leaue them. Nothing is more certaine, as that wee shall leaue them; nothing more vncertaine, as whether they will not leaue vs first.
               In regard of indisposition of our selues, if we bee  attached with sickenesse, if payned in body,Esther 3.5 if disquieted in minde; wee can finde no felicity in them. But especially, if wee endure the combate of conscience; If our conscience be crushed with the weight, if stung with the malice of sinne; they are so farre from yeelding either comfort or quiet, that they are like oyle cast into the fire, to extinguish or abate the flame: They are like the drinking of hot wines, to qualifie a burning feuer; or like the eating of hony, to

asswage the boyling of a chollericke stomacke: a little pleasing in the taste, but much increasing both the paine and danger of the disease.
               These are blessings indeed; but not in themselues,  not for themselues, not indifferently to all. They are blessings in their right vse, they are blessings to a higher end: they are blessings onely to those who should haue beene blessed without them.
               
                   If they bee not rightly vsed, if not vsed to their true end, if so vsed that they drawe or diuert vs from our true end; then are they heauy curses; then should we haue beene blessed, neuer to haue knowen them. Art thou wicked and yet wise? But GOD taketh the wise in their craftinesse,
                  Iob 5.13. Psa. 33.10. 
                  and the counsaile of the wicked is made foolish. Doest thou beare thy selfe proud vpon confidence of thy power?Luke 1.51. and 52. 
                  GOD scattereth the proud, and putteth downe the mighty. Art thou vngodly and yet honourable and rich? But the glory of the wicked turneth to their shame.
                  Phil. 3.19. And what hope hath the hypocrite, when hee hath heaped vp riches,
                  Iob 27.8. 
                  if GOD taketh away his soule? Doubtlesse, the riches of the wicked are rackes and torments; their honours, heauie vanities; their power a tempestuous puffe; their pleasures, sharp feuers of the mind; their serious exercises, childrens plaies. They dazel ignorant eies with exernall shewes; but inwardly they endure many grieuous gripes: they are attended and resorted to by manie; but no otherwise then flies flocke to hony, mice to corne, vultures to a carcasse: The multitude pursue their owne prey; they follow the fortunes of men, not their persons.
               
                  Well then, let worldly matters goe and come: They may helpe, and they may hinder; they doe more often hinder then helpe vs in attaining felicity. Often times we haue no greater impediment to felicitie  in this world, then the world it selfe. He onely is blessed in this life, whose wickednesse is forgiuen, and whose sinne is buried in the tombe of obliuion.
               But stay (my soule) and pawse heere a while: gather a flower or two in thy way; pownd these spices  a little more. Is he only blessed, or is he chieflie blessed whose sinnes are forgiuen? Is not hee more blessed who sinneth not at all? Is it not a greater blessing neuer to sinne, then to haue sinnes pardoned? Yes verely. But this is beyond the nature of man: It is the cursed condition of man to offend. I will neuer esteeme him blessed, I will neuer beleeue him who saith he hath no sinne:Iam. 3.2. For in many things we offend all. We deceiue our selues, we are sencelesse of our sinnes (and being senceles we are immoueable) we are desperatelie sinnefull if we say we haue no sinne. And therefore he onely is blessed whose transgressions are forgiuen, and whose sinne is couered. None other in this world can truely and directly be termed blessed.
               
               For this is a principall propertie of true happines, to bring quiet and contentment to the soule; to set it aboue the region of wishing and of wants; to free it from the tyrannie of feare or desire. Happie is heonly who in soule liues contented; and he most of all vnhappie whom nothing doth content. But this quiet is neuer attained but by remission of sinnes: whosoeuer

hath this mouthfull, he is fully satisfied; he doth not hunger after other things; he no more regardeth either the fauours or persecutions of this life, then doth a dead lumpe of flesh. This is both truely and aptly termed A stood of peace.
                  I will send downe vpon him a flood of peace. Esay There is great peace to them who loue thy Name. Psal. 119. A very flood, indeed; in regard both of the quality, and of the abundance. For it quencheth the flames of our appetites and desires; then which we haue none more deadly enemies, none which more torture and teare our hearts; especially if they be of such things, as either possibly or easily we cannot attaine. But these appetites are drowned and extinguished in this flood: they are either satisfied or silenced by the iustice of this peace. This peace can no man vnderstand,I will giue hidden Manna: which no man knoweth, but he that receiueth it Apoc. 2.17. but he that enioyeth it; because it exceedeth whatsoeuer the vnderstanding is able of it selfe to comprehend.
               
                   Againe, happinesse and miserie are perfect contraries: But sinners because they are vpon their way to miserie, are already miserable; they are already in hell, or rather haue a hell within them: And therefore it followeth, that penitents, because they are vpon their way to felicitie, are alreadie happie, already in heauen; or rather haue a heauen within them. For there are two wayes out of this world; one, through the pleasures of sinne to eternall miserie; the other, through the sorrowes of repentance to eternall glory. Blessed are they who are in this sorrowfull way, for onely they trauaile to eternall happinesse. They are blessed I say by faith, and by hope. For they haue not the full fruition of felicitie, but they enioy it by faith and by hope; and therfore by

faith and by hope they are blessed. This onelie is the difference betweene Saints in heauen, and sinners  that repent vpon earth: the one haue their happinesse in hand, the other in hope: they are at their iourneyes end, these are vpon their way: they haue their blessed estate in possession, these in election. Neuerthelesse they are truely blessed: euen as a Bishop elect hath both the title and honour of a Bishop, albeit he be not stalled in his place.
               Verely, as sinne is no small or ordinarie matter, so  is forgiuenesse of sinne no ordinarie blessing. Sinne is so hainous a thing, that it is a lesse euill to destroy all the creatures in the world, then to commit one sinne against GOD. Yet such is the power of repentance, that by meanes thereof, GOD will not onely forgiue our sinnes, but he will forget them; Hee will so deale with penitent sinners, either as if hee had neuer seene their sinnes, or as if he had perpetually forgot them: Hee will neuer either behold or remember their sinnes to iudge them. Marueilous is the mercy and goodnesse of GOD, towards sinners that repent: The more they remember their sinnes, the more doth he forget them; the readier they are to acknowledge their offences, the readier is he to couer and conceale them.
               It is a verie great blessing to haue our sinnes couered;  because nothing is more hardly kept secret then sinne. Sinne is not couered by cunning contriuance, not with the vaine veile of colourable excuses: the more we endeauour by these meanes to couer it, the more doth it manifest and bewray it selfe.
               
                  
                  
                  Adam did hide himselfe, but his sinne hee could not hide: hee couered his bodie with figge tree leaues, but could finde no couering for his sinne. The more hee endeauored to hide himselfe, the more did his transgression appeare; the very hiding of himselfe did bewray his sinne. For if he had not sinned, hee would neuer haue shrunke aside; he should neuer haue beene attached, either with shame, or with feare. For this cause also GOD said to Cain;Gen. 4.7. 
                  If thou doest euill, sinne lieth at the doore. For assuredly, sinne will not keepe house; It will not lie quiet in a corner; It will abroad, It will stand at the doore; It will manifest it selfe to all that goe by. At the first it is discouered by our owne feares, and by our great diligence to conceale it: afterward, by our loose carelesnesse: Lastly, by our boldnesse and impudency in committing euill. Besides, it is of nature to multiply and encrease; vntill it cannot be contained in secret; vntill it can no more be hidden then the Sunne; vntill by the tumorous turpitude thereof, it doth first manifest, and then ruine and destroy it selfe.
               
                   Onely Repentance is of force to couer sinnes. First, because it cutteth off the encrease, it drieth vp the springs, from whence it swels and ouerflowes, and whereby especially it bewrayes it selfe. Secondly, because it is alwayes accompanied with loue: for Loue couereth the multitude of sinnes.
                  1. Pet. 4.8. Loue maketh the penitent and the innocent of like condition.

                     11 GOD is mercifull in forgiuing, yet hard and seuere in taking accompts.
                     
                     12 Dissimulation doubleth our sinne.
                     
                     13 One sinne sufficient to ensnare vs.
                     
                     14 A true accompt of our sinnes required.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  DIuine Repentance! What shall I say of thee? How shall I worthily either extoll or esteeme thee? Shall I say thou art a vertue? or shall I terme thee some Deitie? Assuredly it seemeth that thou art a Deitie, and that GOD hath imparted a part of his Dominion vnto thee. It seemeth that thou art his Lieutenant vpon earth, and that he hath inuested thee with his owne authoritie: because the same power which GOD exerciseth in heauen, the same doest thou exercise vpon Earth. For as GOD maketh blessed in Heauen,
                     Nisi p
                           •
                        nitentiam egeritis, omnes similiter peribitis. Luke 13.3 so doth Repentance vpon Earth. Only GOD maketh the iust blessed in Heauen, and Repentance maketh sinners blessed vpon Earth: because after sin, no man is blessed, but by Repentance.
               
                   And therefore the Angels that did sinne, shall neuer be blessed; because they cannot repent. Their will is inflexible, they are immoueable from that which once they apprehend:Iob. 41.15 
                  his heart is as strong as stone, and as the Smithes stithe: broken it may bee, but it will neuer bend. That which death is to man, the very same is sinne to Angels: As man after death cannot profitably repent, so cannot Angels repent after  sinne. But the hope of mans blessednesse consisteth in this, that his will is flexible, that his minde may turne to abhorre that which once with pleasure hee  did embrace; that he is capable of Repentance. This is a branch of chasticing Iustice; whereto we can attribute no greater, either praise or power; then that it worketh the same vpon earth, which GOD himselfe

worketh in heauen; by making men happie; by deliuering them from eternall perdition; and by bringing them to vnspeakeable and endlesse ioy.
               And herein it is singular, and eminently alone: herein all other vertues are but handmaides to attend it. For albeit loue be exceeding powerfull,Many sins are forgiuen her for she loued much. Luke 7.47. albeit the fire of loue bee of merueilous force to consume sins; yet doth it neuer attaine this effect, but by vertue of Repentance. In this action of loue, Repentance is the principall worker; loue is a testimonie and declaration, not a proper cause of remission of sinnes. Remission of sinnes is rather the cause of loue,To whom a little is forgiuen he doth loue a little. Luke 7.47. then loue the cause of remission of sinnes.
               It is a very hard thing which GOD cannot doe. But herein hath GOD restrained his power. GOD cannot be mercifull, vnlesse sinners repent: without repentance it is impossible that sinners should be pardoned, because it is impossible without repentance to abandon euill, and turne to GOD. For sinne is nothing else but an auersion from GOD, and a conuersion to creatures; an auersion from an inestimable and immutable good, and a conuersion to a vaine and variable euill. This sinne is neuer pardoned,
                     Quis est homo qui vult vitam, &c. diuerte a malo & fac bonum. Psal. 33. but by forsaking creatures, and by applying our selues againe to GOD; by turning againe from euill to good; by inward loathing the transitory euill, whereto by pleasure wee did adhere; and by fixing our delight vpon that infinite good, which will neuer either varie or faile.
               But this is a proper worke of repentance, this is repentance it selfe. Whosoeuer is thus conuerted in soule, he is truely penitent; hee is blessed in this life,

the LORD will impute no sinne vnto him. And the reason is, because he imputeth sinne to himselfe; hee  preuenteth the imputation of the LORD, by imputing sinne to himselfe: he chargeth, iudgeth, condemneth himselfe; and therefore he shall neuer be, either condemned, or questioned by the LORD.
               For a superiour Iudge will neuer examine that offence, which hee knoweth to be both examined and iusticed by his commission. But GOD hath giuen to sinners, not onely commission, but command, to examine and iudge themselues: which if they will vnpartially doe, hee hath promised that hee will neuer iudge them, that hee will neuer impute sinne to their charge. The Iustice of GOD requireth that sinne should be examined, condemned and punished: but the great mercie of GOD hath made sinners their owne Iudges, their owne executioners and tormentors: It putteth them in choise, either to iudge and condemne their sinne, or to bee iudged and condemned for their sinne: either to put sinne to death in this world, or to die for sinne in the world to come. But blessed is hee who embraceth this mercie; who doeth examine and condemne his sinnes; who doeth impute sinne to himselfe, that GOD may not impute his sinnes vnto him.
               
                  
                  Blessed is he (I say) who hauing sincerely iudged himselfe may boldly looke GOD in the face, and say vnto him:Iob. 10.2. 
                  Condemne me not: tell me wherefore doest thou thus iudge me? Wilt thou proceed against thine owne appointment? Wilt thou violate the direct rule of thy iustice? Thy iustice requireth but one condemnation;

and thy mercy hath giuen me power to condemne my selfe. This I haue already done; I did daily iudge my selfe before thee, and now I did securelie expect thee; I expect not now to bee iudged by thee. For feare of thy iudgment, I haue iudged my selfe; I haue not stayed for thy sentence, I haue preuented it, in giuing sentence against my selfe. Wherefore (then) doest thou thus iudge me? Thou maiest iudge my iudgement, if thou thinkest meet,
                     Iudica iudicium meum.
                   how truely and triely I haue examined my cause before thee, and thy causeagainst me; What good I haue receiued from thee, and what euill I haue returned to thee: Iudge my iudgement (I say) if thou wilt, but doe not iudge (I pray thee) my sinnes.
               For herein especially we must be regardfull, that we iudge vprightlie, that we giue no false sentence, whether by negligence, or by partialitie and selfe-loue: that our iudgement be not either muzled by the one, or misse-led by the other. For he only is in this blessed estate, who maketh a serious search in his soule; who is not deceiued in making his search, who dissembleth not what there he findes: Blessed is he, who deceiueth not himselfe, who dissembleth not with GOD. Who deceiveth not himselfe, in blinding or abusing his owne iudgement; either by a stupendious stupiditie that he hath no sinne, or by a negligent enquirie after them, or by a fauourable estimation of them; or lastly, by a false conceite that he may at leisure and in good time repent. Who dissembleth not with GOD, either in concealing or extenuating any part of his euill; but humbling himselfe

before his presence, laieth open to his view euery vncleane corner within him: and as a poore petitioner, as one who beggeth for a piece of bread, as one who sueth for his very life; rather aggrauate then extenuate his wretched condition.
               For it is in singlenesse and sinceritie of soule, It is by true sence and acknowledgement of our sinnes, that we must both inuocate and obtaine GODS mercy. If we flatter our selues that we are innocent; If knowing our sinnes, we cancell or conceale them, as if we could deceiue GOD, so easilie as we can blinde the world: If (to win opinion) we compose our behauiour to an outward fashion of pietie, and not with the most inward sences of our soule, not with the verie heart of our heart acknowledge and bewaile our fault; If we doe not rather seeke after righteousnes, then make shew thereof: If we do not both promise and purpose and endeauour to amend; If our mind  and our mouth and our outward actions doe not agree;
                     Malus vbi bonum esse simulat, tunc pessimus.
                   we are but hypocrites, the worst of all sinners: VVe increase wrath, we shall neuer come to the presence of GOD. VVolues are neuer more wolues, then when they are apparrelled like sheepe: It is extreame wickednesse to be empty of all goodnesse,The hypocrite shall not come before God. Iob 13.16. Nu. 5.6.7. Leu 5.5. Le. 18.18.22. 
                   and yet aspire to be esteemed good:
               GOD requireth in his Law confession of sinne, before the sinner could be purged: He commanded also that the high Priest should confesse his owne sins and the sins of the people vpon the head of a Goare, and then permit it to escape. For assuredlie, albeit  GOD be exceeding mercifull in forgiuing our debts,

yet is he hard & seuere in taking our accompts.
                     Quia durus homo sum.
                   That which in deed wee cannot, in desire wee are obliged to performe; we must by acknowledgement make tender of that debt, which otherwise we are vnable to discharge. He that hideth his sins shall not prosper, but he that confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtaine mercy.
                  1. Ioh. 1.9.
               
               If we dissemble our sinnes, we double our punishment, because we double our offence: Euen as not onely he that stealeth is an offender, but he also that concealeth a theft. If we dissemble part of our sins, if we keepe backe part, and say that we bring all; we lie to the holie Ghost:Act. 5.3. which is a most fearefull and heauy sinne.
               One hooke sufficieth to take the fish; one snare to fetter the soule: But the Deuill is a most cunning angler, a verie expert fowler; he casteth manie baites, he pitcheth manie snares in our pathes. If we  remaine intangled in any one, if by sincere repentance we free not our selues from all, we shall be sure to be his prey.
               If we acknowledge not our sinnes, we acknowledge  not GODS mercies in forgiuing our sinnes: we we are vnworthie to haue that debt remitted, which we are vnwilling to confesse. So much as we conceale of our sins, so much do we adde ingratitude to iniurie and despight: Wee double the wrong that wee haue done, if to disability for discharge, we adde falshood in our accompt. Let vs first make our true accompt, & then we shall find GOD so easie, as rather to offer then to be entreated; not only to forbeare what we are not ready, but to forgiue what wee are not able to discharge.

                  I MY selfe haue heeretofore beene  either negligent, or ashamed to confesse my sinnes. For I could not bee altogether ignorant; the checke of my owne conscience did often aduertise me, that my soule was drenched in two Stygian streames of corruption, originall and actuall: the one deriued to me by descent, the other proceeding from my proper will. For, by reason of the fall of our  first parent, his bloud was atteint, and corruption was so fast fixed in his nature, that hee transmitted that leprosie to all who euer descended from him. This is the seede of all actuall sinnes, this is in power all sinnes in the world. Not onely if wee act the wicked motions thereof, but if we yeeld consent vnto them, if without consent we take pleasure in thinking of them, then they turne to actuall sinnes. But these delights haue so swarmed in my soule, that I could not but feele the viperous brood within me; I haue so often entertayned them with consen
                     •
                  
                  ▪ so often eyther in deed or by endeuour brought them foorth into action, that I could not but see the hideous heape; And yet I alwayes wanted either remembrance, or disposition to cast vp my reckoning, and to confesse them.
               
                  
                   Sometimes the Diuell did stupifie and benumme my soule; and then I had little or no feeling of my sinne, then sinne lay concealed in me: then either I entertayned no thought, or else was dull and carelesse to acknowledge my sinnes. But as how much  the longer any filthy liquor standeth in a vessell, so much the more is the vessell fouled and stayned, and so much the more hardly can the foule staines bee rubbed cleane: So the longer time that poysonous sinne remayned in my bosome, with a quiet and vncontrouled custome, the more was my vnhappy soule soyled therewith; the more deepe staines were printed therein, and the more hard to be defaced.
               
                   Sometimes I was so sensible of my sinnes, so apprehensiue both of the number & deformity of them, that I became thereby either ashamed or afrayd to confesse them to the LORD; to desplay them before those beautifull eyes, which are much offended with such impure obiects. The shame and the feare which the Diuell tooke away when I committed sinne, hee restored againe when I should confesse them. And as an expert captaine who besiegeth a fort, doeth first blocke vp all passages by which it may receiue any ayd: so the Diuell did in such sort beset and besot my soule, that he stopped all the wayes by which repentance might relieue it. I was easily perswaded not to stirre the vnsauory puddle, not to digge the filthy dunghill of my sinnes to the bottome. For who can answer the iust charge? Who dares thinke vpon the iust punishment for his offences? In this life hee may expect whole armies of euils; and death which is to

others the port of their tempestuous nauigation, to him will seeme a gulfe both of intolerable and eternall torments.
               So I sottishly sought to hide my sinnes in my own  obliuion: I did foolishly flatter my selfe, that thou, O LORD, wouldest neuer remember what I did forget; that my offences locked vp in my owne silence, should bee close shut from thy knowledge or regard: I vainely thought that by not speaking, or not thinking of my sinnes, I should most readily extinguish the memory of them.
               But as fire, the lesse vent it hath, the more furiously it burneth: And as a festred and rotten sore, not opened and cleansed, which the Patient doth not vnfold to the Chyrurgian, and both desire and endure his helpe; putrefieth and enflameth the more, and the more doeth the corruption both penetrate and spread: So my sinnes, whilest they were smothered within my owne conscience, whilest they were not by confession layd open to thee, did not onely more terribly anguish and torment me, but did deeply infect the very substance of my soule. The contagion of sinne did spread like a leprosie ouer euery part; the strongest vertues were infected therewith; all the faculties were drawne to a habite of euill. They did not only anguish me, but they did waste and consume me, they drew thy heauie iudgements vpon me; the dangers which they brought vpon mee, were no lesse then was the disquiet.
               For I felt in my soule, besides the sharpe sting of  my conscience, the heauie blowes, and more heauie

threats of thine indignation. Many calamities thou didst also cast vpon my body, & vpon the issue of my affaires. And so sharpelie didst thou visit mee, both outwardlie and within; that failing, or at least fainting in body and minde, I sunke downe vnder the charge, and melted my languishing soule into moane. My calamities daily encreased, and therewith also my complaints: I complayned dayly, but duly & rightly I did not complaine. For I saw into what miseries  I was deiected, I saw to what mischiefe I did bend my pace: but I neither endeuoured nor intended to cut off, either the cause of the one, or course of the other.
               I did not search into the state of my soule, I did not vnderstand it, I did not lay it open before thee. I did not blame, I did not accuse my selfe vnto thee. I did not returne to thee, I did not put my selfe into thy hands for helpe. I complayned for my calamities; but not for the cause of my calamities. I complayned for the punishment of my sinnes; but I neuer thought of my sinnes themselues. I had onely so much good left, as to see my present euill, and to languish in my distresse: my consuming encreased my complaints, and my complaints encreased my consuming; but I could not spie any sparke of comfort.
               
                   These calamities didst thou execute vpon mee, to draw me to a higher, to driue mee to a deeper consideration of my selfe. For as in diseases, the first degree to recouery, is the finding of the originall cause; so in troubles and distresses, there is small hope of helpe, vnlesse we discerne from what fountaine they

flow. And therefore thou doest often presse vs with a heauie hand, that we should vnderstand our rebellion against thee, that we should both know and confesse our offences, that we should disburthen our consciences of that loathsome loade, which otherwise would poyson our soules to death. This is the cause of our calamities; and from hence must begin our reliefe.
               So thou didst send firie Serpents among thy people, in their passage through the deserts,Numb. 21. which ceased not to sling them to death, vntill they did confesse their sinnes. And for this cause thou didst call Adam
                   in Paradise; not for that thou knewest not where he was, but to giue him occasion to acknowledge his transgression. The Diuell thou didst not call, Thou gauest sentence against the Diuell, vncalled, vnheard; because his will was inflexible, hee could not repent, he would not confesse that hee had done euill. But thou didst call man, because hee could acknowledge his sinne. Because man hath a power to repent his offences, and confesse them to thee, it pleaseth thee still by diuers meanes and occasions to call vs.
               But assuredly, the most powerfull meanes, the  most violent voyce to call vs to thee is by aduersity: more sinners are turned to thee by aduersity, then by prosperity; by feare, then by loue; by shame, then  by hope. Sinners, for the most part,I called vpon the Lord in trouble, & hee heard mee at large. Ps. 118. are like to the spring of the Sun in Sicilie, which at midday is very cold, & at midnight exceeding hot. We grow cold by prosperity; but by calamities our deuotion is enflamed. As much feeding vpon sweet meates, maketh

the body drowsie and dull; so the mind pastured with pleasures, becommeth pestered and heauy in the actions of vnderstanding, and yeeldable to the command of sensuality and sloth.
               
                   Hence it followeth, that it is a great mercy of GOD, to be trauailed and euen tired with labour in this life: It is a true token of his loue, it is a sure signe that hee hath not giuen vs ouer, that he is desirous to conuert vs to him. Man is like the earth, which vnlesse it bee torne vp with the plough, vnlesse it bee harrowed, digged and raked, bringeth foorth wilde weeds, and  little else. Troubles are GODS husbandrie vpon vs. To be spurned by all, to bee a marke whereat all men aime their arrowes, to be pressed with wants, to bee oppressed with wrongs, to haue our life perpetually run in a rugged way; are good assurances, or rather effects, both of his loue and of his care. They are the whips which make madde sinners sober: they are the batterie which enforce obstinate and rebellious hearts, to yeeld to the seruice and subiection of GOD: they are the arrowes which GOD hath taken out of the quiuer of his mercy, and winged with the fire of his Loue. To pierce and to warme our hard icie hearts, he hath tempered his arrowes of tribulation with mercy, and enflamed them with his Loue.

                     22 Contrition is the bruising of a soule betweene feare and griefe.
                     
                     23 The multitude of GODS benefits may much assure vs.
                     
                     24 We must not leaue our repentance vnperfect.
                     
                     25 Sinnes are like a burning ague.
                     
                  
               
               
                  TO this end didst thou beare a heauy hand ouer me; thy punishments did presse me very sore; thou didst multiply many miseries without intermission  vpon me. Thou diddest cast many rugged rubbes in the smoothest passage of my affaires; thou didst beat vpon my body with variety of infirmities; but especially thou diddest lay an intolerable load vpon my soule. My soule thou diddest both charge and torment, with a mountanous heape of

dolours and feares; whereof I was vnable, either to sustaine the weight or endure the griefe.
               Before me were the multitude of my sinnes; behind me, the hideous horrour of them; on the one side, feares approaching; on the other, hopes abandoning; aboue, Iustice threatning; beneath, vengeance expecting: within, agony and anguish of soule; without, terrours, disconsolation, dread, and almost a hellish darkenesse of despaire. For thou diddest not only enuiron and assaile me with furious feares; but thou diddest heape discomforts vpon me: thou diddest cut off the supply of thy sweet consolations; thou diddest drie vp or restraine the influence of thy grace, wherby I should haue been both animated and aided in my distresse; thou wouldest not affoord me one beame of fauor.
               Oh! what a cruell enemie is feare? Shee marcheth  with inumerable troupes in her traine, ranged in order, armed at all points, and shaking their terrible instruments of death. Iustice carrieth the ensigne before her; despaire soundeth the loud alarme; disconsolation, trembling, distrust, with all the curses & threats of the Law, with all the examples of GODS weighty wrath, present the first charge. She marshalleth  al creatures in squadrōs against vs; al our friends she draweth to her part; our secret thoughts she mustereth on her side: She hath a thousand treacherous intelligencies within our owne bosome, which await but hower and occasion to surprise vs. Thus aduancing her selfe in the pride of her power, with a high and horrible voice she cried vnto me;
               
                  Come foorth thou fugitiue! Come thou deiected, thou reiected traitour! tell me, Wretch! Where now is thy assurance? Who shall defend thee? whither wilt thou retire? Goe too now; Goe seeke for some mantle to veile thy obscene darkenesse: For thou canst not with any conscience (in case thou hast any) approach into the presence of the LORD. What? expectest thou to be releeued by him? Thinkest thou he will fauour thee? Nay, Is it possible that hee should forbeare thee? Seest thou not that he also is set against thee? That his hand is rigorous vpon thee? And how can it be otherwise? For GOD is iust; a hard dealer; a seuere exacter of accompts. Looke into the examples of his iustice: How he condemned his angels irreuocablie, for one only sinne; how for one only sinne, not onlie Adam but all his posteritie, and in a manner all creatures were cursed.
               If thou conceiuest comfort by reason of some mercie which followed this iustice; then compare this iustice and mercy together, by the continuall course of their effects. See how in all ages, both the greatest and most flourishing parts of the world, haue lien buried in infidelity. See how in those few parts, ouer which the light of trueth hath displaied her beames, many millions haue bin blinded, either by ignorance, or by superstition and errour. See how many, yea how most of those, who haue receiued true knowledge; either by delicacie, or other viciousnesse of life, reape no benefit thereby. So as it is apparantlie true, that many are called, and few are chosen: that the

way to saluation is so difficult, and the gate so strait, that it is passable for very few.
               Few indeed: For how many were in the whole world, when it was ouerwhelmed with waters? How many in Sodome and the cities adioining to it, when they perished with fire? How many among the chosen people of GOD, when Elias could not espie one? How many, when they were often captiuated, and finally ruined, and dispersed? Yea, seest thou not the iustice of GOD to be so implacable, that when flourishing nations are vtterly rooted out, infants and innocents, who haue not actually offended, are swallowed in the common calamity, for the offences of their progenitors? Compare (I say) these effects of iustice and mercy together, and thou shalt plainely finde, that the first hath farre exceeded the last; that there are many vessels of the one, and few of the other.
               Now if thou hopest to be one of those few; then consult with thine owne conscience, how cleare and vncorrupt thou findest thy actions; how seuerely thou hast restrained thy euill inclinations; how strongly, how violently thou hast endeauoured to mainetaine a vertuous and religious life. No, no; thou art none of those few, who with perpetuall strong striuing shall wrestle through that narrow passage. Thou hast beene vnconstant, both in thy iudgement, and in thy actions: like a loose tooth; not onely vselesse, but troublesome and painefull. Thou hast beene a slander to the Church, and a staine to thy profession: Thou hast beene a derision to the

euill, a shame and sorrow to the good, an offensiue example to the weake. The earth casteth thee vp, heauen receiueth thee not; GOD is displeased with thee, and all creatures are bent to oppresse thee. Goe to then, abandon hope, and yeeld thy selfe captiue to despaire. Thou hast no other remedie against thy feares but to relinquish hope: Cease to hope, and feare will no longer torment thee; for whosoeuer hopeth for no good, he feareth no euill.
               These words she doubled with a terrible voice, and all the hoste cryed aloud, Despaire and Die.
               
               
                   Woe is me! I am vndone. Alas wretch that I am▪ Which way shall I turne mee? Whither shall I flie? What shall I doe? I am assailed with feares; by feares I am betrayed; my enemies are within and without. Who shall deliuer? who shall defend me? I am as a naked tree in a wide plaine, beaten with many bitter stormes: I am as drie open ground parched with the burning beames of the Sunne: I can finde none to protect mee, none to comfort mee; and my owne strength and courage vtterly faileth. Out alasse! who so liueth in feare, he is daily condemned, daily vnder the executioners hand: No man is assured, whom an euill conscience holdeth in feare. O! who is able to endure these confusions? Who can either resist, or rule the violence of these feares?
               
                   Thus whilest I was readie to haue yeelded my selfe to the tyrannie of despaire; loe, Faith from heauen did sodainly cast a glorious beame of her beautie vpon mee; and, with a sober sweetnesse began in this sort, partly to reprooue, and partly to instruct me.
               
                  What? (said she) Art thou such a nouice in my Schoole? such a faint and raw souldier in spirituall combate? Hast thou no more dexteritie in handling thy weapons? Come, stand vp, take courage; I will teach thee both thy fence and thy fight. Come, (I say) and looke thy terrour in the face: It seemeth a Serpent to deuoure thee, but be not dismayed, step  boldly to it, and take it by the taile, and it will forthwith turne to a rod of correction. What? Art thou so much afraid of feare? which is so highly commended Ps. 103.13 & 128.1. prou 10.27. & 14 27. & 19.23 & 22 4. & 28.14. Ecclus. 1. & 2. & 3. & 40.

               What? deemest thou that GOD hath created hell fire onely to punish damned sinners and the Diuell? No verily: but rather to keepe sinners from damnation; to raise them to repentance, and to restraine  them from sin. For so much as a man feareth the punishment that he hath deserued, so much more carefully wil he, both repent and auoid those faults which he hath committed.
                     Non cito perjt ruina, qui ruinam timet. Senec.
                   He that feareth ruine is neither easily nor often oppressed therewith. They haue greatest cause of feare who feare least; who walke in their owne wayes with a sober securitie; who loosely and licentiously pursue vanities; who are flintie 
                  
hearted, without trembling or touch of the threatnings of GOD; who perseuere in sinne, either boldly or sencelesly; and then say, What euill haue I done? Let these feare: It is fearefull for these to fall into the hands of the liuing GOD. Ouer the neckes of these hangs a terrible sword, alwayes shaking, alwayes bent and ready to strike; the lesse they feare it, the more sure, the more sore and heauie will it fall. These are obiects to GODS iustice and wrath; these are abiects from his mercie and grace.
               But repentant sinners, who rise with feare, and run with griefe to the LORD of mercie and say vnto him; LORD be mercifull to me a sinner: Let such bee confident; For he who hath in mercie called them, will assuredly in mercy receiue them. They are not a few  onely, who haue beene receiued; this is a false surmise of feare: let heauen, let earth, let hell be searched, and there shall not one be found, I confidently say, not any one, who returned to the LORD, and was not receiued. Neuer thinke that the iustice of GOD is greater then his mercie. Nothing can bee sayd in GOD greater or lesser; because whatsoeuer is in him, is his very selfe. There was neuer sinner in this world, who hath not had a sweet taste of his mercy; neither was there euer righteous person, who hath not beene touched with his iustice: His iustice and his mercie are extended to all. For all the wayes of the  LORD are mercie and trueth. Besides, mercie bestoweth so many and so great good things vpon the righteous, that her workes farre exceed the workes of iustice. Neuer trouble thy selfe about the small

number of the elect: Assuredly they are not a few, but almost innumerable, whom the LORD will receiue to mercy. Mercy will be no lesse milde, then iustice rigorous: mercy will no lesse finde a meanes to saue, then iustice to condemne. As the number of the elect is knowne only to GOD, so both the time and maner of their calling must onely be referred to him.
               But what mooueth thee to doubt and distrust thine estate? the multitude and grieuousnesse of thy sinnes? Trouble not thy selfe for the multitude and grieuousnesse  of thy sinnes; because the mercy of the LORD doeth infinitely surmount them. Behold, how two contraries applied together, if the one far exceed the other, the greater must needs consume the lesse. But the mercies of GOD infinitely exceed al the sins in the world. All the sinnes of the world are more easily consumed by the mercie of GOD, then is a droppe of water in a hot fiery furnace; then a sparke of fire is extinguished in the sea. Doe but applie now this mercie to thy sinnes; and the infinitenes of the one, must needs consume the multitude of the other.
               But loe, shee hath already applied her selfe: Shee hasted to meet thee; shee hath already kissed thee; she holdeth thee close in her embracements. Yea, when thou didst fall she was present with thee (albeit thou diddest not discerne so much) shee layed her hand vnder thee, to keepe thee from harme, and to raise thee againe. Thou art a vessell both brittle and weake; thou must needs haue beene dashed to pieces, or much bruised with thy fall; vnlesse mercie had laid vnder her hand. This is a great signe that thou

                   art elect; but it is not all. For mercie hath not onely preserued thee from the harme of sinne, but she hath turned thy sinne to thy good: For thereby she hath made both thee more humble in thy opinion, and more heedfull in thy wayes. The fall of the reprobate is like the fall of an elephant; they rise not againe, but impudently make light esteeme of their sinnes; and sometimes with a flintie forehead boast of them: But though the elect fall into the bottome of the sea, yet the same whale which swallowed them vp, must againe cast them vpon the land.
               Arise therefore, and strengthen thy heart: thou hast found how weake thine owne forces are; humble thy selfe vnder the Almighty arme of the LORD. For humility is the foundation of all vertues; the lowest ground-worke of repentance. Humble thy selfe therefore with sorrow for thy sinnes past, and circumspection for thy life to come. If thou canst so  humble thy selfe with sorrow, then neuer feare; this sorrow is the greatest ioy to a godly mind that can be; the more of this sorrow thou findest within thee, the lesse cause thou hast to feare. And to this examination now I leaue thee, to what degree of submisse sorrow thou canst descend; for assuredly, to the same pitch of assurance thou shalt be exalted.
               
                   This said, she glanceth gloriously into heauen, leauing me well confirmed against feare; but altogether exposed to heauinesse and griefe. For when I presented to my rememberance, either the vaine, or vile and base pleasure of my sinnes, the good which I did loose, the euill which thereby I did incurre;

how my most meeke GOD, by the goodnesse of his owne nature was mooued, was prouoked, was inforced by my ingratitude to be wroth; I was forth with ouercharged with heauinesse, which did trouble and torment me day and night; which bereaued mee of all ioy, and was extreamely burdensome to me. She rushed vpon me with her sad troupes; she cried out most bitterly and said;
               How now! presumptuous wretch, Wither art  thou carried? Into what vaine hopes doest thou run? Supposest thou thy selfe to be rapt vp into the third heauen? to be already placed in Abrahams bosome? Alas! deceiued caitiffe; thy faith is but a fantasie; thy hope a proud presumption of spirit; thy comforts but a dreame of a deluded imagination. Thou conceiuest that GOD is mercifull: it is true; exceeding mercifull; infinite in his mercies. But knowest  thou not how odious an offence ingratitude is? How it stoppeth the streames? how it drieth vp the dew of mercy? how no mercy hath influence where ingratitude abides. Ingratitude is the summary of all sins: no euill, no reproach is left vnsaid, when a man is charged to be vngratefull. No beast is either so fierce or so dull, but hath some sence of gratitude, and will loue those who are carefull for them. The hands which feed the Lions, may safely touch their teeth and their pawes: Elephants for their food, make both their courage and their strength seruile to man. So naturall is this vertue, that those creatures which want vnderstanding, are both apprehensiue and obseruant thereof. And so hatefull is ingratitude to

the most mercifull GOD, that he hath threatened by his holy spirit,Pro. 17.13. that Euill shall neuer depart from his house,
                  Sap. 16.19.

                     th euill for good: And that the hope of the vnthankefull shall melt away as the winter yee.
               
               Consider then how vngraciously vngratefull thou hast beene: consider this, I say, and if thy owne heart shall condemne thee, thinke what he will doe who is greater then thy heart, and who hath euen already opened his mouth to pronounce his arrest. He hath created thee according to his owne image: he hath placed thee in the paradise of his blessed Church: with the water of baptisme he sanctified thee; he furnished thee with the knowledge of his trueth, putting his word in thy mouth, and his will in thy minde: with many temporall benefits he did enrich thee; not onely for necessitie, but for an ornament and delight.
               But thou in the leuitie and vanitie of thy braine, diddest runne headlong after thine vnbridled lusts, and plunge thy selfe in many deepe sinnes. Many outward callings he bestowed vpon thee; with many sweet instructions he did aduertize thee; but albeit all the floore was moistened with his heauenly dew, yet thou (like Gedeons fleece) remainedst drie: thou didst keepe thy selfe (like the riuer Nilus) within thy bankes, when all other riuers did ouerflow. He inuited thee, and thou diddest excuse thy selfe; he sent to compell thee, but thou diddest resist. At the last he called thee with a violent voice, and his vnspeakeable goodnesse broke open the gates of thy obstinacy. He raised thee from thy fall by his power;

he instructed, he enlightened thee with his wisdome; he brought thee from the tempestuous sea of this world, to the port of a calme conscience, and planted thee in a land of religious conuersation. Yet thou notwithstanding, either vnmindfull, or vnkind, hast exalted thy heart, and thereby lost that wisedome, which should haue made thy worship and seruice acceptable to the LORD.
               Thou knowing his will, hast beene negligent in performing the same; albeit thou knowest, that, Cursed is hee who doeth the worke of the LORD negligently. Yea, thou hast not done it at all; thou hast manifestly and manifoldly transgressed his will; and therefore art most worthy to be beaten with many stripes. Thou hast forsaken his seruice, who is so bountifull, that he rewards a cup of cold water with eternall life; and thou hast serued sinne, which giueth no wages but death, but eternall death. Oh wofull wages! it were far better to goe vnpaid and serue for nothing.
               
                  O Lucifer! who saidest in thy heart, I will climbe vp into heauen: Thou must humble thy selfe so low as hell, or else neuer looke to encounter mercy. Knowest thou not that rebellious ingratitude giueth limits to mercy? where else were iustice? Who should receiue iudgement, if mercy did alwaies wait vpon sinners? Goe to then deiect thy selfe, abiect wretch; creepe among moathes and wormes; abase thy self to the very gates of despaire, in regard of this thy obstinate vnkindnesse. Open thy vnderstanding; draw all pensiue conceits greedily into thy soule, and

pine away in a consuming langour. Sith thou hast lost thy ioy, make much of thy sorrow; sith thou hast no comfort but in complaints, bestow them largely.
               
                   Oh! what a heauie burthen is heauinesse to the soule? It is more ponderous then the whole masse of the earth; It is more poisonous then the breath of the Cockatrice. It murmureth against, GOD; It prouoketh to blaspheme; It prouoketh to despaire; It turneth all matter of solace and ioy into mountaines of lead, to weigh vs downe; It admitteth neither contentment nor quiet. But as to many sicke persons all sweet things seeme bitter; so to those who are vnder the arrest of heauinesse, all meanes, either of delight, or of comfort, are turned to matter of torment and disquiet. And verely my miserie did so deepelie drowne my memorie and whole minde in sorrow, that all the remembrance of GODs promises lay ouerwhelmed with the thicke throng of discomfortable  thoughts; and heauinesse would haue altogether ouerborne and beaten me downe, had not Faith, and her sweet sister Hope come to my reliefe, and with most comfortable countenance and speech thus sustained me.
               
                   So, so: this worketh kindly, and as it should: this working of the medicine giueth very good assurance of health. Alasse, weake wretched sinners! how are ye deceiued by your sottish sence? The poisonous pleasures of sinne which bane the soule, you sweetly swallow without distaste; but you cannot rellish feare and sorrow, the principall expellers

of this poison. At these you make a sowre face; you can no waies enforce them downe. Whereas a soule once infected with sinne, cannot possibly be recouered to the state of Grace, but it must first be bruised  and broken betweene feare and griefe, as a graine of corne is grinded betweene two milstones. And this moouing of the soule betweene feare and griefe, referred to GOD, maketh a broken and contrite heart, which he doth neuer despise. And this is that contrition which is the first part of true Repentance.
               O louely feare! O sweet sorrow! O happy hand which was so heauie vpon thee,
                     Secundum duritiam tuam & cor impoeniteus thesaurisas tibi iram in die irae.
                   & suffred thee not to lie sencelesse in thy sinnes, heaping to thy selfe wrath against the day of wrath. Let it be a comfort, a great ioy vnto thee, that this heauy hand hath raised and pulled thee out of the ordure of thy sinnes. If heretofore thou hast beene vnthankefull, be thankfull now, and thy former vnthankefullnesse shall not be remembred. The multitude of his benefits is so  far from dismaying, that it may much assure thee. For he who hath so loued thee, will not now leaue thee; He who hath begun his worke in thee, will in time expedient expedite the same. VVhat is more vsuall in noble natures, then to follow their owne fauours? then to loue those most, vpon whom they haue bestowed greatest benefits? to heape many honours vpon such as haue beene first aduanced by them? And hath not the most noble nature said, that, To them who haue, more shall be giuen?
               Againe, what naturall cause beginneth a worke, and leaueth the same vnfinished? The vertue of seed

ceaseth not in the leafe, not in the flower, vntill it hath brought foorth seed to a perfect ripenesse. The bird neuer forsaketh her yong, vntill shee see them able both to flie, and to prouide for themselues. Doeth nature compell inferiour causes to perfect their effects, and shall not the cause of all causes bee mooued by his most infinite goodnesse and loue, to finish the worke which hee hath begunne? Are not all the workes of the mighty GOD perfect?
                     Dei perfecta sunt opera, Deut. 32.4. Hath not the same infinite goodnesse and loue sayd? It is my worke to doe the will of him that sent mee, that I should make perfect his worke. Feare not then: hee who hath begun to loue thee, will neuer change, but will persist to loue thee to the end: the same goodnesse that moued him to conferre many gifts and blessings vpon thee, will mooue him to perfect all by giuing thee euerlasting life. For wherefore did he turne thy heart from sinne? wherefore did hee prouoke thee to Repentance? but because hee purposed to make thee cleane?
               
                   But as thou doest expect, that GOD will not leaue his worke vnfinished in thee; so breake not off thy worke in the middest with him. Thou hast attayned to contrition in a moderate degree: but rest not there; proceed now to confesse thy sinnes; which is the second  part of true Repentance. For sinnes are like a burning agu
                     •
                  , which commonly breaketh foorth at the lippes. So long as the heat remayneth within, it searcheth and anguisheth all the entrailes; but when it breaketh foorth at the lippes, it is an assured signe of health. Goe with vs then, and wee will bring

thee before his presence. Acknowledge there thy sinnes; Hide none of thy transgressions from him. Leaue feare behinde; for milde and mercifull is the LORD, hee turneth to those who turne vnto him: but take sorrow with thee, and season thy confession, therewith, Sorrow will make thy confession not only not offensiue, but pleasing to him.

                  THen I aduanced my selfe to the second forme of repentance; From  contrition I proceeded to acknowledgement and confession of my sinnes. Because I saw it was a childish weakenesse, rather to perish by the disease, then to empty the stomacke of dangerous humours; to suffer sores rather to putrefie and spread, then to endure the cleansing and curing of them: rather to endure a perpetuall toothach, then to haue the tooth pulled foorth. And seeing it was for this cause that GOD was so  seuere against mee, namely for that I would not acknowledge my sinnes; seeing by no other meanes I could wrestle out of those difficulties, wherinto his displeasure had cast me; I forthwith resolued to turn to my GOD, and to turne forth my heart vnto him; to powre out all the putrefaction of my soule before his pure eyes; to open my Conscience, and giue a vent to those filthy fumes, which had almost stifeled my

soule; which were more loathsome, more infectious, then is the damp of dead putrified bodies: In a word, to say with holy Iob; If I haue hid my sinne, as Adam, concealing my iniquity within my bosome.
               
               
                  
                  Iob. 31.33So I presented my selfe before his diuine Maiesty, with the same countenance, wherewith a poore distressed patient, full of impostumes, Fistulaes, and vgly vlcers, presenteth himselfe to an expert Chyrurgian: And being prepared to endure, both the paine of the corosiue, and point of the lance, I thus addressed my speech vnto him.
               
                   O LORD my GOD, most rich, most liberall, most mercifull GOD! who sitting aboue the Seraphims, with thy eyes farre brighter then the Sun, piercest all depthes, and discouerest all things naked and open to thy view: Thou, O LORD, who art so powerfull, and yet so pitifull to that which thou hast made, that thou hearest and regardest miserable sinners; Graciously behold, be fauourably attentiue to me, I beseech thee. Behold mee thy miserable creature, not in anger, not in iustice, but in compassion and mercy; not as a seuere Iudge, but as a skilfull and carefull Physician; not to punish my infirmities, but graciously to cure them. O mercifull GOD! no lesse infinite in Mercy then in Maiestie; In goodnesse and in greatnesse vnmeasurable alike; Behold, my exceeding great miseries; my exceeding great, but not infinite miseries: not such as can beare any proportion  against thy mercies. For betweene great and infinite there standeth no proportion.
               
                  O infinite goodnes & mercie! I am in a most miserable estate, & yet how to better it cānot tel. My doubtfull and perplexed thoughts doe wildely wander in a maze of amazement: And this is nothing else in effect, but to beat out, with what torments I am likest to perish. Alas! O my GOD, wilt not thou relieue mee in these extremities? wilt not thou release me? O infinite goodnes! With al humilitie I entreate thy ayd, not vpon any cōfidence in my selfe, but faith & hope, two twins of thy brest (who neuer yet haue either let  fall, or bin denied any suit) haue guided mee hither, and set me before thee: Loe, they remaine still present with mee. They encourage me, they assure me that the more miserable we feele our selues to be, the more fit we are to receiue thy mercies; and the more standeth it with thy iustice to afford vs the same.
               O thou who art both liberall and rich! relieue my pouertie. O most mercifull and powerfull LORD, release my miseries. Heare my distressed soule, full of wretchednesse, but fuller of guiltinesse, groaning at thy gate of mercie: See how fowlie it is defiled with euill: how deepely corruption hath tainted the verie substance thereof: how the stamps of sinne, by reason of long custome, are so firmely imprinted therein, as it is a hard matter to deface them. I am like an vncleane beast, that hath long wallowed in the proper  dung; whereby both the beautie hath beene defiled, and a loathsome taste is fixed in the flesh. Alasse! I am plunged in sinne as in a sea, wherein I neither see banke nor feele bottome; & wherin my vaine soule at the same time both floateth with the leuity,

and is drawne downe with the leaden weights of sin.
               O GOD of my saluation! my impure soule hath hitherto beene much troubled, much endangered, and almost stifeled by enclosing her corruptions, and not giuing a free passage for them to breake foorth. But now I confesse my sinnes, I confesse how grieuously I haue offended thy maiestie. I haue broken all thy commandements, as if they had beene cobwebs; and my verie best thoughts haue beene poysoned with  taste of things sensuall. The poysonous breath of my thoughts, euaporated from my sensuall soule, hath beene more offensiue and noysome to thee, then the dampes that arise from bodies halfe putrefied in their graues. Of all thy debtors, I confesse that my accompts are greatest, that thou hast most to reckon with mee. but giue mee respite for repentance, and I  will satisfie, if not thy iustice, by payment, yet thy mercie by acknowledgement. Haue patience a while, and by confession I will pay thee all. LORD, I will not hide my offences, for then wilt thou display them: I will lay them open that thou maiest hide them; I will acknowledge them that thou maiest take no knowledge of them: I will not conceale my miserable defects and defections from thee; lest thereby I loose, first thy pitie, and then thy reliefe.
               I will neuer goe about, either to abuse, or to auoid thee, by denying or 
                     •
                  uppressing my sinnes; I will no  waies extenuate, no waies excuse them. I will not extenuate them, either by fauourable comparing them with the sinnes of other men, or by vnderualuing them in their owne nature. I will not excuse them


by casting the blame vpon any other; vpon the malice  and power of the Diuell; vpon the witchcraft of the world; vpon the soft flatteries of the flesh. These are the vaine veyles which our first parents vsed, The woman gaue it me, the serpent deceiued mee: But they cannot suffice to shadow our sinnes. For  they are not able to compell the will, they can no wayes enforce the soule: Allure it they may; but enforce it they cānot: they may knock at our gates; but they cānot breake in, vnles we open to entertaine thē.
               And therefore I will neuer endeauour to excuse that, which my owne conscience conuinceth. I will sincerely acknowledge my sinnes; I will take the whole blame vpon my selfe; I will not transferre any part thereof to any other. For my conscience is so torne with the bitings of sinne, my soule is so stretched vpon the racke of sorrow; that I am enforced to cry nothing else, but, O my sinnes! I charge, I accuse, I condemne onlie my selfe. O my GOD! I haue grieuouslie sinned; my sinnes haue deepelie prouoked thy heauie wrath; I acknowledge them to thee with a free confession. LORD, I appeare before thee no other then I am; euen a most poore desolate and distressed sinner: I can neither boast nor take comfort in any goodnesse in my selfe; but I lay open before thee my sinnes.
               
               And it is vnto thee that I will confesse my sinnes;  
                  vnto thee, against whom onely I haue sinned; vnto thee, who onelie art able to forgiue my sinnes; vnto thee, who onelie art able to iudge of my confession. For it is not alwaies thy pleasure, that we blazon

our owne blame, that our sinnes be rung out to the eares of all men; that they be set foorth vpon the stage of the world. If penitentlie we confesse our sinnes vnto thee, thy compassion will couer them. It will couer them from thy iustice, it will couer them both from the scandall and scorne of other men: thou wilt freelie forgiue both the sin and the shame. Assuredlie the conscience of man is thy little kingdome: It is thy peculiar Consistory and Court. There thou sittest, there thou examinest, there thou iudgest. With this kingdome thou wilt not depart, thou wilt not impart it to any other. None can know the secrets of the soule; none can absolutely, either discerne or command the inward working thereof but thy selfe. Whosoeuer will presume, either to know, or command the working of the spirit; whosoeuer will determine of the last end and state of soules (further then thou hast plainlie reuealed) he vsurpeth thy throne; he wresteth thy scepter out of thy hand. As thou onely art able to iudge of our confession; as thou onlie both knowest and forgiuest sinnes; so vnto thee will I euer acknowledge my sinnes.
               
                   Yet will I not be ashamed that the world also take knowledge, that men also thinke that I haue done amisse. I will not forbeare to abase my selfe by reason of my sinnes, euen in open view; to sorrow, to lament, to be sowre and seuere against my selfe; to abhorre the world and all her sorceries; to loath the poisonous pleasures of the bodie; which are like  to moathes, that consume the garment wherein they breed; to chastice and tame my filthy flesh, for rebelling

against thee, by whose power it was made, by whole prouidence it doeth consist; for conspiring the destruction of my soule, which keepeth it from stincking, from turning to most course and loathsome carrion. I will neuer beare the world in hand, that my offences are either few or light; I will by confession make them knowne to thee; I will by sorrow, and some measure of satisfaction, make them knowne to the world. No shamefastnesse shall retaine me from mourning at any time, from making a sad and seuere reckoning with my body, from holding a sharpe hand vpon it. For assuredlie, either we must lament in this life with profitable teares for a time, or else with fruitlesse and endlesse teares in the life to come: either in this world we must tie our selues to some moderate paine, or else be chained both to intolerable and eternall paines in the world to come.
               Neither will I acknowledge my offenees in part, but I will make an entire confession, and expose all my transgressions before thee. Not only my great sinnes, but my vnrighteousnesse, which seeme of lesser moment; not onely the euill which I haue done, but the good which in dutie I should haue done: I will discouer all my vnrighteousnesse vnto thee. I will doe  as the lepers were commanded to doe, when they came to be clensed by the Priest; I will not only wash my garments, but will haue all my haire;Leu. 14.8. euen my lightest and loosest offences. That thou who numbrest our haires, when thou shalt take a view of my sinnes, shalt not finde one haire of them, which I haue not runne ouer with the razor of confession.
               
                  
                  1. Sam. 15.I will not doe as Saul did, who being commanded to slay all the Amalekites, and all the cattell that pertained to them; destroyed all that was vile & nought  worth, but saued the King, the great King Agag, and the fattest sheepe and oxen aliue. I will not make away my vulgar and vnprofitable sinnes onely, and saue the principall and aduantageable aliue; but I will set the sword of confession to them all. I will not make reseruation of some sweet sinne, and then say with Naaman the Syrian;2. Reg. 5.18. 
                  The LORD bee mercifull to me in this. But I will sweepe the house cleane, or  else can it neuer be furnished and adorned with thy graces, and thereby made fit to entertaine thee. I will cleanse my conscience of all defilements. One drop of poison tainteth a whole tunne of wine; and one mortall sinne infecteth all the faculties and vertues of the soule. One snare is sufficient to entrappe the fowle; one hooke to take the fish; one leake to sincke a ship; one sparke of fire to prostrate a whole City; and one sinne sufficeth to draw both bodie and soule to destruction. I will therfore discharge my selfe by confession of all;Lam. 2.19 
                  I will powre forth my heart as water before thee.

                     17 How ready GOD is to receiue to mercy.
                     
                  
               
               
                  BVT what a maze doe I begin to tread? How shall I euer winde my selfe out of this knotty labyrinth?  Verily if I should make a particular rehearsall of all my sinnes, I should neuer bee able to finish that taske, I should neuer roule the stone ouer that hill: I should no sooner mount it a little, but it would alwaies tumble againe down to the bottome: I should euer finde my worke new to begin. I may well say with Iudas, I haue sinned; but either number, or truly estimate my sinnes, I cannot. If I could number the starres of Heauen, or the sands of the earth, or the drops of water that are in the Sea, or the moments of time since time began; yet am I out of hope to enumerate my sinnes: because they are no fewer in variety then they are in number: in number equall to those which I haue sayd, but farre exceeding them in variety. The summe of them is, the manifold breach of euery branch of thy Commandements; whereof many of the most haynous  sticke stiffe in my conscience, like sharpe stitches in a sicke mans side; whereof the pleasure lieth heauy in

my Soule, like sweet meats of extreame hard digestion. The most especiall of these are, either blasphemous and prophane, or light and vaine vsing of thy most blessed Name: vile and vaine behauiour and speech, vnthankefulnes, couetousnesse, cruelty, pride, ambition, anger, malice, enuie, riot, sloath, violence, hypocrisie, flatterie, &c.
               These particulars I vnfold before thee; in euery of these I haue many times offended; yea, many times whereof I was neuer sensible: For what man knoweth how oft hee offendeth. More also would I acknowledge to thee, if more I could call to my remembrance; and therefore, O cleanse thou me from my secret  sinnes. Which assuredly are so much the more dangerous, in that they lurke within mee secret and vnseene; awaiting aduantage alway to intrap mee, and finally to breake foorth to my destruction.
               But see the milde mercies of our GOD; see the greatnesse of his goodnesse towards vs; see how prone he is to pardon our sinnes, how ready to reconcile vs to his fauour. For I did but say, I will confesse my sinnes; and so he forgaue the wickednesse of my sinne.
                   I had scarce addressed my heart to confesse my sins, scarce let one teare drop from my breast, but I obtained fauour and forgiuenesse of him. I sayd I will confesse my sinnes, and thou forgauest the wickednesse of my sinne. Oh! that wee were such seruants to thee, as thou art to vs a LORD; so ready, so willing to confesse our sinnes, as thou art fauourable to forgiue  them. Thou regardest not the measure, but the trueth of our repentance; not the extension, but the

                  intension; not how ceremonious it is, but how sincere. Our purposes thou takest oftentimes for full performances: oftentimes thou acceptest our designments for deeds: thou who art a spirit, regardest only the spirit; the outward actions are many times supplied by thy grace.
               
                   And this especially maketh vs vnexcusable, if we doe not repent; because pardon may be so easily obtained; because it requireth so little paines. To obtaine pardon of all our sinnes, a full confession is not alwaies necessarie, but a full and sufficient griefe is required. If the griefe be sufficient, it is of force to abolish  sinnes. Such is the vertue of a true contrite heart, that if it be ioined onelie with a will and endeuour to confesse, it blotteth out, it wipeth away the guiltines of sinne; so as the sinner shall neuer be damned, if he returne not to his wickednesse againe. But confession of sinnes, with all the workes of satisfaction which a man can either effect or imagine, without a contrite heart; are nothing auaileable, nothing worth. A contrite  heart is so necessarie for the remission of sinnes, that without it, no man hath euer beene saued; no sinnes haue beene euer remitted. For as GOD is offended onely with the heart, so with the heart onelie is he pleased; he desireth nothing but the heart: Sonne giue me thy heart. Nothing offendeth GOD but the heart; take away the will and intention of the heart, and all our actions are indifferent: and therfore from the heart must satisfaction proceed. The medicine must be applied where the disease is setled; the sinner must vse iustice vpon the same part where sinne was

first hatched, and where it raignes: Euen as offenders are commonlie punished, or branded vpon the same parts of their bodies, wherewith they did offend. Because we sinne with the heart, GOD requireth the punishment of the heart; which is done by full and true contrition.
               To obtaine remission of our sinnes, something is  required on our part, and something from GOD. From vs, sorrow and detestation of our sinnes; and a liuely Faith in our great SALVATION: from GOD, the imparting of his grace: neither of which require any long trace of time; both of them may be done in an instant. For the sorrow of contrition requireth  no determinate continuance of time; but as a man is damned by one peruerse act of his will, so by one contrarie act of his will hee is made fit on his part to bee iustified. Otherwise it would follow, (which the mercy of GOD will neither allow nor endure) that the way of saluation through shortnesse of time, should bee blocked vp against sorrowfull sinners;
                     In quacunque hora ingemueris peccator omnium iniquitatum cius amplius non recordabor. Ez
                           •
                        k. 18. and that at what time soeuer a sinner doeth truely mourn, he should not be releeued.
               
               As for the grace which proceedeth from GOD, much lesse doeth it either require or beare the very least protraction of time. For, because his vertue is infinite, it is not included, it is not excluded by any compasse or measure of time. If there bee no defect of sorrow in vs, there is neuer defect of grace in him; hee doeth iustifie a sinner, and restore him to his fauour in a very instant, euen whensoeuer hee is rightly disposed by sorrow to receiue his grace.

                   GOD is so plentifull in mercies, and so prone to impart them to vs, that wee neede but to open our hands, and they shall bee filled; euen as wee neede but to open our eyes to enioy the bright beauty of the Sunne.
                     Aperi os tutum, &c.
                   The Grace of GOD is so farre from defect,
                     Ecce ego fio ante ostium, & pulso, si quis au lierit vo
                           •
                        em me

                        m, & aperuerit, intrabo ad eum, & cae nabo cum illo & ipse mecum.
                   that it preuenteth our dull desires, it knocketh at our heauy hearts, it worketh in our sluggish spirits; wee can neuer bee so ready to entertaine it, as that is to enter. When our sinnes expell GOD out of our soules, hee will not goe farre, he will stand at the doore; he will there knock, and hourely expect to be receiued againe.
               Blessed bee thou, O omnipotent GOD! who so aboundest in mercie and in loue; who art so  easie to bee intreated for great offences, so ready to bee receiued of those who did despitefully both driue, and for a long time keepe thee out of their gates. Oh! how vndue on thy part, how vndeserued on our is thy goodnesse? how farre beyond all expectation? all hope? Certainely wee can neuer bee left so drie and emptie of thy grace, but out of thy plenty, or rather plenitude and fulnesse, wee may easilie againe be stored.
               O searcher of soules! I haue so far as my weaknesse sufficeth, confessed my sinnes vnto thee; I haue disgorged my stomacke, stuffed with loathsome and dangerous humours; I haue discouered those vnseemely soares, which heeretofore I endeuoured to conceale. And now (mee thinke)  I beginne to reuiue; my feare now beginneth to change into hope. As heeretofore I desired to auoid

thee, as a sharpe searcher, as a seuere iusticer of my offences; so now I runne after thee, and cast my selfe into thy armes, as my onely assured refuge and defence. Blessed be the houre wherein I was first enlightned, first emboldned to acknowledge my sinnes. In this houre haue I receiued a singular testimony, a sweet taste, both of thy loue, and care, and liberality towards me. Let others blesse the time of their birth, the time wherein some prosperous aduenture did befall, the time wherein either they atchieued some great aduantage, or else escaped some disastrous euill: But I will blesse this happie houre, the most happy that possiblie could happen to mee. O my GOD! encrease the pleasure which I haue conceiued, in being displeased with my selfe, for displeasing thee: Let mee take so great contentment and delight in repentance, as euer I did in committing sinne. So shall my felicitie approach, if not equall the felicitie of thine Angels: So shall I bee aduanced from the low condition of my griefe, to the high and glorious state of thy grace.
               O eternall GOD! O true light of our eies! If this  be the effect of troubles and griefe, if this be the worst of them; I will bow my backe, and set my shoulder to the load: I will not onely endure calamities, but I will reioyce in them. I will humbly intreate GOD, that I may neuer want these assurances both of his loue, and of his care; I will earnestly inuite them to come vpon me, to affoord me their help, either in returning, or retaining me to GOD. Assuredly  a life without aduersities is like a standing puddle,

a dead sea: as tempests preserue water and aire from  putrefaction; so doe troubles the mind. He that neuer tasted of troubles, knoweth not himselfe, and seemeth to be little regarded of GOD. He knoweth not himselfe, because he neuer made proofe what he is able to doe: he seemeth little regarded of GOD, as a person without courage aud heart; vnworthy of combate, vnfit for triall. He that neuer knew aduersitie, is ignorant of the greatest part of the affaires of this life: He is exceeding miserable in this, that hee neuer knew what misery meant. Great vertues delight in trouble, as valiant souldiers doe in warre.
               O most louing, most rich, most liberall LORD! How can we be able, I will not say to expresse; but to vnderstand, to imagine thy sweet gentlenesse and loue? I did no sooner thinke to returne vnto  thee, but thou were vpon the way to meet me: I did no sooner say that I would confesse my offences, but thou diddest open thine armes to receiue mee to mercie: I did no sooner call to mind the paines which my sinnes did merit, but thou diddest accord to remit the same. I expected thy rebukes, and thy roddes; but I receiued thy kisses: I looked that thou wouldest haue thundered foorth thy threats, that thy angrie arme would haue dashed mee to dust; but thou diddest encounter mee with thy embracements, thou diddest entertaine mee with a sumptuous feast. Thou diddest more reioice to doe mee good, then I (heauie beast) did to receiue it. O fauourable LORD! How much more ready art thou to pardon, then to punish? How

much more ready to grant thy pardon, then wee to desire it? Verelie, no louing father can so graciously receiue his childe, cast downe at his feet, and in the lowest descent of submission crauing his fauor; as thou hast graciously receiued me.

                     4 Also all the godly vpon earth.
                     
                     5 Who by examples of Mercy, shall bee encouraged to resort to GOD.
                     
                     6 Remission of sinnes, is a case reserued onely to GOD.
                     
                     
                        7 Remission of the least sinne, requires no lesse vertue, then the creation of the world.
                     
                     8 Resort to GOD must bee in a seasonable time.
                     
                     9 The seasonable time in regard of GOD.
                     10 The great difference betweene the seasonable time, and the time ensuing.
                     
                     11 The seasonable time in regard of our selues.
                     
                     12 The dangers which wee incurre by deferring repentance.
                     
                     13 The doubtfull estate of those who repent very late.
                     
                     14 Late repentance little auailable, not by any change in GOD, but by defects in our selues.
                     
                     15 It is little better then desperation, to sinne vpon confidence of repentance.
                     
                  
               
               
                  FOR this cause my heart hoppeth  with in mee for ioy; my spirit is enflamed, and my blood boileth with a holy heat, both to extoll and extend thy praise. My soule glorieth onely in thy goodnes and grace. It blameth, it accuseth nothing but it selfe; It complaineth, it crieth out against none but it selfe. It is my will, it is my actions, it is my selfe that I haue lamented: But GOD hath beene gracious to mee, it is in his grace that I will reioyce. Hee hath opened mine eyes, to see my owne deformities and defects; he hath touched my heart with shame and with griefe; hee hath vnlocked my lippes, both to confesse my faults, and to craue compassion: if not so

soone as it was requisite, yet before it was altogether too late. Although I haue lost much time, yet hath he not suffered me to lose all; although I did not apprehend the first offers of occasion, yet did not hee permit it wholly to slip away. Praise the LORD; O 
                        •
                     y soule!
                  Psal. 146. 
                  whilest I liue will I praise the LORD; yea so long as I haue any being will I sing praises to my God, &c.
               
               
                   But because I am not able sufficiently to praise thee, I will intreat the ayd of all thy creatures; let them all ioine with mee in the sweet harmonie of thy praise. Let all thy wind instruments tune to this consort: Let euery thing that hath breath praise the LORD.
                  Psal. 150.
               
               
                   Especially I incite to this holy office, all thy blessed Saints in heauen; who did heeretofore in like sort participate of thy grace, and now participate of thy glorie. For so many Saints as are now in heauen, so many sinners haue beene vpon earth; there neuer was, nor shall be any but one who may say, which of you can reprooue me of sin? They all needed thy grace to repent, they all receiued thy gift to be forgiuen. Let them all bee examined, Let them answere freely, by whose power they are saued, they will all acknowledge; It was not our sword, and our bow, but thy hand and the strength of thy arme that hath gotten vs the victory.
               
               Also all the godly vpon earth shall praise thee, for this example of thy compassion and loue: For that thou hast declared thy selfe so prone to pardon, so readie to releeue, so rich and plentifull in thy reliefe: For that thou art not onely easilie entreated to remit

our sinnes, but prone and bountifull in heaping thy graces and fauours vpon vs. They shall also be encouraged  heereby, to flie vnto thee, to pray vnto thee. When their sinnes and offences lie heauie vpon them, when they are enuironed and oppressed with distresse; they shall neuer despaire, neuer distrust to bee both released and releeued by thee. Yea, euen the most righteous and iust shall for this cause addresse their prayers to thee. For there is not one among the sonnes of Adam, but his necessities require that hee pray often to thee; both for pardon and reliefe.
                     Ecce quiseruiunt ei non sunt stabiles & in Angelis suis reperis prauitatem, quant

                        m magis hi qui habitant domos luteas, & terrenum habens fundamentum. Iob. 40. Whosoeuer thinketh that he hath no need, deceiueth himselfe, and in very truth stands most in need. Then doe we begin to bee iust, when wee begin to see our owne vnrighteousnesse; and the further wee proceede in the one, the more shall wee encrease in the other.
               And they shall pray vnto thee, and onely vnto thee: because thou onely forgiuest sinne. Remission of sinnes is so great a worke, that it is a case reserued onely to thee: thou onely forgiuest sinne, who onely art offended by sinne. No creature whether in heauen  or vpon earth,
                     Ego sum, Ego sum ipse qui deleo iniquitates tuas propter me. Es. 43. hath priuiledge to pardon the least sinne: the forgiuenesse of the least sinne requireth no lesse vertue, then the creation of all the world. In creation nature is giuen, in iustification grace; which in many degrees exceedeth nature. If no man bee of  power to giue nature to things,
                     Quis potest facera mundum de immundo conceptis semine monne
                   much lesse is any man of ability to giue grace. When the king of Syria sent Naaman his seruant to the king of Israel, that hee should cure him of his leprosie; the king of Israel tore

his garments and said: Am I a GOD that I should cure a man of his leprosie?
                  
                     t
                           •
                         qui solus es? Iob. 14. But assuredly, if no power but of GOD was able to cure a bodily leprosie, no inferiour power can cleanse the loathsome leprosie of the soule: For this cure must all men resort to GOD.
               
                   But this they must doe in a seasonable time; they must apprehend occasion, which no wise man, either fearing thee, or louing himselfe, will suffer to escape. For as opportunitie at some times of our life, is fairely offered to all; so if it bee not taken when it comes, it can neuer be ouertaken when it is gone. This time is whilest thy treasures are opened, whilest thou maist be approached, whilest thou maiest bee found: whilest thou proclaymest thy pardon, whilest thou repellest no man, whilest thou inuitest all: whilest thou almost entreatest sinners, loaden and perplexed with their heauie charge, to come to thee for releefe. If in this time they pray vnto thee,
                  
                     Iustitia tu
                           •
                         sicut gurgites maris Isai. 48. the floud of thy furie shall not inuolue them; they shall not be swallowed in the rauenous gulfe of thine indignation.
               But if they suffer this time to slippe; if they be so held down with sensual either pleasure or sloath, that they will not awake out of the slumber of sinne; that they will not arise and pray vnto thee: another time shal then succeed; when the full streames and stormes of thy displeasure shall violently breake foorth, and sodainely enwrappe all those, who either through negligence, which is ill; or through obstinacy, which is worse, perseuere in their licentious life. And the longer it be before these flouds come vpon them, with the greater fury will they fall: Euen as riuers,

the greater distance they runne from their springs, the more waters they gather, & with the greater violence they run. Or as the longer a man to be drawing a bowe, the neerer he drawes the arrow to the head, and with the greater strength it flieth from his hand.
               At that time, they who now may haue easie accesse, shall not be able to approch thee; they shalbe driuen away, they shall be commanded with a sad bitter curse, to depart from thee. Thou who now keepest open house, wil then perpetually shut vp doores: thou who now artfull of pity, plentifull in reliefe; wilt then finally iudge, and afterwards eternally punish. Pharaoh did hardly oppresse and detaine the people of Israel a long time; no intreatie, no punishment could mooue him to permit them to depart; he pursued them with an army euen into the sea: But when he saw the waters comming vpon him, he acknowledged the power of GOD, and said:Exod. 14. 
                  Let vs flie, for the LORD fighteth for them. Then he repented, then he would haue gone back; but it was too late. The water flouds came vpon him too fast; sentence of death had then passed against him; then GODS wrath and the waters came vpon him together. When the floud-gates of GODS fury are opened vpon vs, it will so violently driue vs both from his fauour and face, that it will be impossible for vs to approach him.
               Againe, they who let slip the time of their youth, of their health and of their strength; and with varietie of delaies driue off to reconcile themselues to GOD, vntill by age or by sickenesse they become

weake; vntill they arriue to the last period of their  liues: they are in danger to deceiue themselues. They are in great danger, that either their hearts will be so hardened with long custome of sin, that true repentance cannot sinke into them: or else that the feeblenesse of age, the paines of sickenesse, the dismaidnes of death, the horrour of sinne, the terrour of iustice, and a thousand like perplexities, as so many floud-gates, will rush vpon their soules, and altogether ouerwhelme them; so as they shall not be able to approach  neere to GOD. For being rowled in these streames, it cannot but be doubtfull at the least; that they who in former times were forgetfull of GOD, should then be forgetfull of themselues; that they who had no will to repent, whilest they had power to sinne; when they are vnable to sinne, should haue a very weake either will or ability to repent: that GOD will then as little regard their cries, as they did formerly  regard his callings. Not vpon any change in him, but by reason of defect in themselues. Because their complaints and cries at that time; and happilie their sobs, sighes, and teares, are not a voluntary motion of the will, but a violent enforcement vpon necessitie. They are rather effects of amazement, or of despaire; then of any liuely and powerfull repentance.  Verely, it is little better then desperation, to sinne vpon confidence of repentance in times to ensue. There is little, either proofe or thanke in the amendement of our will, when we are past, either the pleasure or the power to proceed in sinne.

                     6 And of these his goodnesse is most excellent and glorious.

                  BVT as for me I will speedily and in good time runne vnto thee, as vnto my assured refuge; against outward feares, against inward weaknesses, against all dangers or disquiets. When I haue offended thee, when I haue stumbled, when fallen into any sinne; I will not basely and beastly lie still; I wil forthwith arise & run vnto thee, as to a place  to hide me in. To hide me vnder thy mercie, both from the stroke, and from the search of thy iustice. When I am assailed by mine own euill inclinations, When my spirituall enemie doth either vrge or allure  me to sinne; I will runne to the protection of thy power, as to the onely meanes to preserue me, against the furies and treacheries of these encounters. When humane hatred doth set vpon me; when molestations, troubles, dangers, doe beset me; when entrapments of all sorts are spread abroad, either

particularlie against my selfe, or more generallie against  others with me; I will runne to the protection of thy prouidence and wisedome, where I shall bee most assuredly preserued. Let others runne whither they please. Let them trust to their friends, to their riches, to their wisedome, to their power, or to any other thing which in the view of the world seemeth able to defend them: I will shrowd my selfe vnder thee. Thou art my refuge, thou art the place to hide and preserue me: In all my necessities thou art my retreit. When Sathan assaulteth, when the world enticeth, when my owne filthie flesh enclineth and betraieth me; when temptations, when aduersities and dangers enuiron and oppresse me; this is my onely comfort, that thou art good, and that I may haue resort to thy goodnesse; which is the most excellent attribute and perfection that thou hast.
               True it is, that among all thy perfections, one is not greater or lesse then another: because euery one comprehendeth the most high and simple nature of thy diuinity, whereinto no comparison can fall. Yet as thou doest manifest thy selfe to vs, three of them are most excellent: thy goodnesse, thy wisedome and thy  omnipotent power. These are the three fingers which sustaine the earth. Of these, thy goodnesse mooueth thee to be bountifull to thy creatures; thy wisedome contriueth how this may most beneficially be done: thy power bringeth the worke to effect. And albeit these are equall in thy selfe, comprised together in thy diuine prouidence; yet as thou declarest thy selfe to  vs, thy goodnesse is most excellent and glorious, from

whence thy mercy doeth proceed. This thou most extollest in thy selfe; this thou most expressest in thy workes, whereof alwayes thy goodnesse is the cause. For thy goodnesse draweth thy infinite wisedome and power to concurre with it, in bringing thy benefits to effect.
               And because it is the nature of Goodnesse to communicate and dilate it selfe; thou who art the originall 
                  Goodnesse, hast imparted many good things to thy Creatures. Not for any necessity to thy selfe, not for any increase of thy glory: for neither art thou defectiue in any thing, neither can any thing enlarge thy glorie: but because thou wilt not be good alone. Because thy goodnesse is of nature to extend it selfe, it hath made other creatures to participate therof. Thy goodnesse and thy glorie thou hast imparted to other creatures; that as thou enioyest thine owne essence and beautie, so they also should behold, loue and enioy the same: albeit not in the same degree with thy selfe: because they cannot comprehend thee, as thou comprehendest thy selfe. This is the felicitie and glorie which filleth the capacitie of our soules, and maketh them happie. And to this end it pleased thy infinite goodnesse to create, not onlie Angels, but also men: That so abiect a creature, in one part neerest to beasts, should sit at thy table, and feede of thine owne dish.
               Blessed be this noble Goodnesse, which hath so  freelie and mercifullie communicated it selfe to so base creatures. This Goodnesse is the contentment and delight of my heart; this onelie is able, not onely

to refresh, but to reuiue the soule with inward consolation: There is no solid, either comfort or assurance, but in this Goodnesse.
               
               And therefore whensoeuer I am enuironed and  euen oppressed with dangers; when infinite euils shall on euery side assaile my body or my soule; with humble haste I will runne to thy Goodnesse: thy Goodnesse shall then be not onely a buckler, but a bulwark to defend me. Vnder the defence of thy Goodnesse, I shall not onely be safe, but secure: Not onely safe from dangers, but secure also and free from feare. Although the earth tremble, and the mountaines be carried into the bosome of the sea; yet vnder this protection I will not feare. For among other things, this is one of thy chiefe endeuours and cares, to deliuer thy seruants and friends from dangers; to appease their mindes from disquiet; because thou knowest what wee are, and whereof wee are made. Thou knowest how feeble our forces are; feeble by nature, but by often transgressions altogether disabled  from releeuing our selues; altogether vnable either to resist, or to beare the calamities and dangers which presse vpon vs. A man may destroy himselfe,
                     Perditio tua ex te Israel, in me auxilium tuum. Hos. 13.9. he may cast himselfe into an Ocean of misery without thee; but saue and releeue himselfe without thee he cannot; this is a speciall worke of thy goodnesse and grace. In this worke all power without thee is  weake, with thee no weakenesse but is sufficient: VVithout thee life is dead,
                     Pone me iuxta te & cuiusuis manus pugnet contra me. Iob. 17. with thee death it selfe is aliue. All power is weake against him who is vnder thy power; If thou be at my hand, no hand is of force

against me: my weakenesse shall bee supported by thine omnipotent power.
               
                   And I shall not onely be defended vnder protection of thy goodnesse, I shall not onely be deliuered and preserued against mine enemies; but I shall preuaile and be victorious against them. As I was before beset with dangers, so shall I bee there enuironed with ioy: I shall not onely bee free from feare, but filled with vnspeakeable ioy. Oh happy soules! who are arriued in so sure custody; who in all the trauerses of this life, are guarded by the puissant hand of GOD. VVhat euill can either assaile or approach you? VVhat good doe you not enioy? No euill can approach you; because you alwaies flie from euill: you enioy all good, because you enioy that goodness which makes you alwaies doing of good.Fly from euill and doe good.
               
               O good GOD! giue mee a taste of the plentifull  pleasures wherewith their soules are satiated whom thou hast deliuered, whom thou doest defend; from the strong chaines, from the strait prison, wherin the Diuell would hold them captiue. VVho being full of ioy, full of blessed contentment and quiet, liue like thy selfe: without perturbation, without feare or  hope. O my GOD! how vilelie doe they esteeme the voluptuousnesse of this life? How doe they not onelie forbeare to desire, but loath and abhorre to quaffe off that broken bruage, which the flesh with a harlots hand presenteth to them, in the base and impure cup of this world? How little relish haue they in those flashie vnsinewie pleasures, which breake the forces of the soule, and cast it into a drunken dreame?
               
                  They soare aboue the sphere of earthly delights; they neuer stoope vpon so course carrion, but aspire to prey vpon Angels food. And they are no lesse  free from the dangers of the world, then from the delights; no more troubled with the feare of the one, then with desire of the other. They may bee hated, but harmed they cannot bee; they may bee persecuted, but they cannot perish. For nothing killeth the soule but sinne; sin only is the sword that killeth the soule: that soule which sinneth shall die.
                  
                     Eze. 18.4. But nothing is sinne vnlesse it be voluntary; Take away the will and all actions are equall: and therefore a soule doth not perish, vnlesse it will, vnlesse voluntarilie it committeth euill. So it followeth, that they cannot perish, because they will not: Because they will not returne  to their sinnes, they cannot incurre the penaltie of sinne. And this they will not doe, because their spirit is gouerned by thy grace; because their will is subiect to thy will; because thy will and their will are twisted together, as it were into a fast twined threed.

                     4 Correcteth the will.
                     
                     5 Not only instructeth, but leadeth with his hand.
                     
                     6 Enlightneth and guideth with his eie.
                     
                     7 To what end GOD fixeth his eies vpon the righteous.
                     
                     8 The eies of the LORD are working eyes.
                     
                     9 They make a soule both beautifull and rich.
                     
                     10 The incredible goodnesse of GOD.
                     
                     11 The eyes of the LORD not onely teach, but enable.
                     
                     
                        12 A heauenly voice.
                     
                     13 Our eyes must also be firmely fixed vpon GOD.
                     
                     14 But first they must be made cleane.
                     
                  
               
               
                  COME hither now all ye who want  vnderstanding, the very forme and essence of man, and I will instruct you: I will instruct you in that  which is most intelligible, and yet hardest to bee vnderstood. For as nothing is more visible then GOD, yet nothing lesse seene, by reason of his exceeding brightnesse; so nothing is more intelligible then GOD, yet nothing lesse vnderstood, by reason of his surpassing greatnesse. Come hither, I say, all yee, who know not the trueth; all ye who wander out of the right way, come hither to me: come all ye who are desirous to attaine a happie life, whereto all the passage of our life is nothing else but a toylesome trauaile. I will enforme you in the pure trueth, which experience of mine owne errours hath taught mee; I will direct you in the right way, which after long wandring I haue beaten out; I will point vnto you the cleare Sunne of Life, which after many stiffe stormes hath disclosed to me a most louely light: whose bright beames haue dispelled all darke pitchie cloudes of despaire, and reduced my thoughts to a quiet calme. All yee who would taste the great goodnesse of GOD, who would be made happie by remission of your sinnes; ye who would obtaine his ayde in your necessities, his comfort

in your distresse; heare mee whom experience hath taught; Or rather heare the LORD himselfe: Listen well what hee saith vnto you, and lodge vp his words carefully in your breasts.
               Come vnto me, thou miserable man; If thou hast any care of thine owne estate; If thou hast any loue and desire of thine owne safetie, come vnto me; and thou shalt see what I will doe for thee. I will enforme  thy vnderstanding, in what errours and in what dangers thou passest thy life; and how thou maiest in best manner amend the one, and auoid the other. I will instruct thee to know the euill which I hate, and the good which I require; the miseries which awaite the one, and the happinesse which is prepared for the other.
               But because men do not commonly offend through want of vnderstanding, but through peruersenesse of will: For that the knowledge may well bee furnished, partly by the benefit of nature, and partly by instructions from other men; but both these are not of power to rectifie the will and restraine the appetite. They may point out the way, but they cannot giue either appetite or strength to trauaile therein: they may set good meate before thee, but they cannot giue  a stomacke to eate: Come therefore vnto mee, and I will not onelie direct thy vnderstanding, but I will correct the appetites and inclinations of thy will: I wil not onely informe thy iudgement to discerne what is best, but I will conforme thy will to embrace and execute what thou doest discerne. I will not onely remooue errours from thy knowledge, but disorders

also and dulnesse from thy desires.
               And because the way which thou pacest is both  difficult and darke; full of intricate turnings, full of rough and broken places, wherein thou maiest easily wander or fall; full of stoppes to impeach thee; full of snares to entangle thy feet; some of pride, some of auarice, some of riot, some of lust and other trumperies of the world; so as none can escape but by my illustration and aid: I will therefore lead thee vpon my hand, I will both stay and direct thy steppes: I will conduct thee to eternall felicitie and life. I will not commit this charge to my Angels, but as I did lead my people of Israel, in the day by a pillar of a cloud, and in the night by a pillar of fire; so day and night I will be thy guide. In the day of prosperitie, with my grace of moderation; in the night of aduersitie, with my grace of comfort: these two pillars shall neuer forsake thee. I will remooue all impediments from before thee: I will make thy passage both streight and smooth.
               Let great persons of the world send their harbengers before them,Thou shalt make equall the righteous path of the iust, Psal. 26.7. to make their iournalls both easie and safe. But I my selfe will leuell thy way; I will remooue and auoide all hinderances, I will make thy walke both pleasant and plaine. Anchore not thy minde to things of this world;Crooked things shal be made streight, and rough wayes bee made plain, Luk. 3.5. Let not thy thoughts bee troubled either with hope or with feare; Arrest thy selfe wholy vpon mee, and I will take the charge into my hands: I will haue a care ouer thee, as a father hath ouer his child. I will neuer turne my countenance from thee, thou shalt walke alwayes in my 
                  
sight, I will firmely fixe mine eyes vpon thee: I will watch ouer thee, so as nothing shall faile which may aduance thee to a happy life. Mine eye shall enlighten thee, mine eye shall direct thee, mine eye shall furnish thee with all supplies; vntill thou arriue at the place, where thou shalt want nothing but what thou wouldest not haue: where thy aboundance shall equall thy desires.
               O sweete wordes! and what frozen heart can receiue them, and not bee melted into delight? and not bee enflamed with the loue of his creator? What? Wilt thou fixe thine eyes vpon vs indeede? Yes verely;Psal. 34.14 Psal. 33.17 
                  The eyes of the LORD are ouer the righteous: The eyes of the LORD are vpon them that feare him, and put  their trust in his mercy. But to what end? To deliuer their soules from death, and to feede them in the time of dearth.
                  Psal. 33.18 Good: And so it seemeth, that they shall neither perish nor want. For they shall bee deliuered from death, and fedde in the time of dearth. Thine eye is so fixed vpon them, that whosoeuer toucheth them to harme them, hee toucheth the apple of thine eye. All sweete saciety is plentifully powred from thine eyes.
               
                   Assuredly, the eyes of the LORD are working eyes; grace streameth from his eyes, as light and heat streame from the sunne. The sunne doeth not so much both adorne and enrich the earth with his illustrous beames, as the eyes of the LORD by their influence both enrich and adorne the soule of man;  as they make it radiant both in pure beauty, and in plentie of good workes. O mercifull GOD! how

sweete is thy Spirit? What comforts and delights breathe hourely from thee? How art thou so enamoured with our sinnefull soules, that thou wilt not turne the eyes of thy Maiesty from them? How come they so deare vnto thee, that neither danger nor want can seize vpon them? LORD, I am astonished at  this vnmeasurable goodnesse; my thoughts are so ouerwhelmed and confounded therewith, that I am enforced to crie vnto thee;
                     Ps. 141.3. 
                  What is man that thou hast such respect vnto him? or the sonne of man that thou so regardest him?
               I did once goe astray, ouer carried with the company  of ordinary men. But since the LORD hath vouchsafed to cast his countenance vpon me, since he hath turned to me his amiable eie of compassion and grace; I haue not only beene instructed what to doe, but enabled to performe the same. New forces, new life hath beene infused into me: I haue not only been directed which way to walke, but I haue beene guided and supported in that way. And now (me think) this heauenly voice perpetually soundeth in mine eares.
               
                  FEare not, behold, as I haue infused a soule into thy body, so will I infuse my spirit into thy soule; to guide all the actions and motions therof: that as thou hast a naturall life by the one, so thou mayest haue a spirituall life by the other. This spirit shall cleere thy vnderstanding, encline thy will, rule and moderate all thy steps. And further, mine eye shall not be off thee, my hand shall continually support thee: euen as (yea much more then) a carefull mother beareth a vigilant eie and hand ouer her tender childe,

going in places, where it is both easie and dangerous to receiue a fall.
               
               
                   When I heare this voice, I fixe likewise mine eies immoueablie vpon my guide: euen as a diligent pilot fixeth his eyes vpon the starre whereby hee steereth the course of his nauigation. As the moone receiueth her light from the sun, so shall my eyes receiue both their light and their life from those gracious  eies. I will first make them cleane, and then turn them like chrystall glasses, to reflect the impression of those glorious lights. I will put my selfe into the conduct of him, who only both is able, and hath promised to guide me to eternall happines. I will carefully obserue those louely and liuely lookes, which doe so carefully preserue me.

                  BE ruled by me then, & doe as I haue done, (O my friend) take it from my experience for the best. Range thy selfe in order, and bee guided by his Grace. Haue recourse to him in due time, whilest hee permitteth, whilest he inuiteth, whilest he entreateth thee to come. Now he gently calleth thee into the right-way of saluation, now hee courteously offereth both his direction and aide: Heare him,  regard him, obey him. If thou wilt not doe this in respect of him, doe it at least in respect of thy selfe, in respect of thine owne benefit, in respect of the condition of thine owne nature. Doe (I say) accordingly

as thou art, and as the nature of thy being requires.
               Thou art a man, endued with reason and vnderstanding, wherein GOD hath engrauen his liuely image. In other creatures there is some likenesse of him, some footsteps of his diuine nature; but in man, he hath stamped his image. Some things are like to  GOD, in that they are; some, in that they liue; some in their excellent propertie and working. But this is not the image of GOD. His image is onely in that we vnderstand: which is so neere a resemblance of him, that nothing in all his creatures can so cleerely expresse him. For as GOD doeth vnderstand and loue  himselfe; so man by his intellectuall power, is both apt and inclinable to vnderstand and loue him. And the more perfectly man doeth vnderstand and loue GOD, the more liuely doeth he expresse his image.
               Seeing then that thou art of so noble a nature, & that thou bearest in thine vnderstanding the image of GOD; so gouerne thy selfe as is fit for a creature of vnderstanding. Bee not a man onely in name, and in outward feature, but in conditions of mind a beast; plunging thy selfe in those brutish pleasures and desires, whereby the flesh vanquisheth and destroyeth the spirit. Bee not like the brute beasts which want  vnderstanding; either wilde and vnruly, or else heauie and dull: the one whereof must alwaies haue the snaffle betweene their teeth, the other the spurre vpon their side. Be not stiffe necked, be not slow paced; doe not furiously fling after the pleasures, doe not obstinately insist in the customes of a licentious life. Be not caried with the sway of thy appetites, with the

tempestuous rage of thy sensuality, without any discourse, without any rule, or restraint of reason.
               Thinke that thou art a more excellent creature, then to be anchored like a beast, to earthly thoughts: Thinke that thou art bound to declare that difference which nature hath set betweene thee and bruit beasts, not in outward appearance and behauiour, but chiefly by the disposition of thy mind. Vnderstand thy state, vnderstand thy dangers; and then expresse some iudgement, care, and industry, how to auoid them. For assuredly, thou wantest either faith, if thou doest not beleeue thy danger; or vnderstanding, if with all care and diligence thou doest not endeauour to auoid it.
               Aboue all, be not halfe a man, be not carefull and  regular in thy life to halfes: for such a one liueth most miserably, because he enioyeth neither GOD nor the world. He enioyeth not GOD, because he hath not grace enough to make him his owne: The world he doth not enioy; for that hee hath so much taste of grace, as to discouer the vanitie and iniquity of his pleasures.
               Thou mayest happily obserue foure degrees of  sinne: the desire, the action, the custome, the obstinacy or contempt. Desire bringeth forth action; frequencie of action, draweth on custome; custome runneth into habite; habite, into nature; from whence proceedeth obstinate contempt. Whensoeuer therfore thou fallest into any degree of sinne, lie not still, beware of custome; for this will soone rise into contempt,

which is not pardonable; because so long as  contempt standeth,
                     Insanabilis est fractura tua. Ier. 30. it is not possible that the sinne should bee remitted. Obstinate impenitencie is said to bee impardonable, for that thereby a sinner disesteemeth and despiseth the mercie of GOD: which if he would entertaine and embrace, then is hee not obstinate, then are his sinnes both possible and easie to be forgiuen. For no sinne is vnpardonable with GOD, when with sinceritie and humility of heart, the sinner desireth mercie; which contempt will neuer permit him to doe.
               And therefore at the very first summons that GOD  shall make, range thy selfe readily vnder his obedience. Doe not struggle against his directions, be not slow in performing his pleasure: Doe not either by obstinate rebellion resist, or by cold dulnesse extinguish the good motions of his grace enspired into thee. Doe not constraine him by afflictions to constraine thee to his seruice; as a beast is constrained by bridle and whippes to be seruiceable to man. Be not good onely vpon compulsion and feare, neither let compulsion and feare deterre thee from goodnesse: But be like a sure blade, whereof albeit the point bee bowed to the hilts, yet will it not so stand, but returne foorthwith to the straightnesse againe. Weigh thine actions with vnderstanding, do them with loue, walke cheerefully in the wayes of the LORD; bee readie, be desirous and ioyfull to be guided by him. For GOD who is a spirit, respecteth the spirit; he desireth, he accepteth principally the heart: he is better pleased with the manner of our doing, then with that

which we can possible doe.
               
                   Certainely, of all the creatures vnder heauen, which haue receiued being from GOD, none degenerate, none forsake their naturall dignity and being, but onely man; Onelie man, abandoning the dignitie of his proper nature, is changed like Proteus, into  diuers formes. And this is occasioned by reason of the libertie of his will: which is a facultie that transformeth men into so many things, as with violent  appetite it doth pursue. Hence it proceeded, that in the creation of other things, GOD approoued them and saw that they were good; because he gaue them a stable and permanent nature. But of the goodnesse of man no mention at all. Mans goodnesse was left vnapprooued at the first; because GOD gaue him libertie of will; either to embrace vertue, and be like vnto GOD; or to adhere to sensualitie, and be like vnto beasts.
               
                   And as euery kinde of beast is principally inclined to one sensualitie more then to any other; so man transformeth himselfe into that beast, to whose sensualitie he principallie declines. For as the first matter is apt to receiue the impression of any forme, so man by reason of his affection and will, is apt to be transformed into any beast. This did the ancient wisemen shadow foorth by their fables, of certaine persons changed into such beasts, whole crueltie, or sottery, or other brutish nature they did expresse. And what else did others signifie, by seeking for a man with a candle, in the greatest assemblies of a most populous city, but that all were degenerated

into beasts?Cap. 5.1. 
                  Run to and fro (saith the Prophet Ieremie) by the streets of Ierusalem, and behold now, and know and enquire in the open places thereof, if ye can finde a man. And againe the same Prophet saith:Cap. 10. Cap. 21. 
                  Euery man is a beast by his owne knowledge. And againe: The Pastors are become beasts, and haue not sought the LORD; therefore haue they no vnderstanding.
               
               And hereby thou maiest discerne (O man) the deformitie  of thy most seemely sinnes; which raseth the image of GOD out of thy soule,Psal. 18. alias 19. and transformeth it into the image of beasts. For Man being in honour, and without vnderstanding, is compared to the foolish beasts, and is made like vnto them.
               
               O sonnes of Adam! created after the image of GOD; adorned with many naturall and supernaturall gifts. Doe not abandon your selues, Doe not abandon reason to embrace sensualitie; doe not cast off the dignitie of your condition and state, to follow the base fashion of beasts. Euery thing naturally loueth the life. You haue no similitude with beasts; but GOD hath created you to his owne image, to the end you should loue him. GOD hath endued you with reason, to make you differ from beasts: vse it, and vse it well. If you doe not vse it, then are you beasts; If you vse it not well, but abuse it, then are you  worse then beasts; then are you deuills. If it pleaseth you not to be as you are, I will tell you how you  shall best transforme your selues: endeauour to resemble GOD, to transforme your selues into him, by imitation (so much as it is possible) of his sanctity and puritie: Euen as he hath said: be ye holy, as I am

holy. This is a blessed change; this is the greatest perfection that can be either wrought or wished to a reasonable creature.
               
                   What man will desire or endure to serue his enemie, his fellow, or his seruant? The Diuell is your enemie; the flesh your fellow; the world your seruant. The first seruice is vnprofitable, for it affoordeth no wages but death: the second vncertaine, for you are alwayes menaced to be turned out of dores: the third is most base and vaine: for suppose you could atchieue all the world, what is it? A needles point, a moat, a mite, a nothing.
               You are now in your passage through a wide and wilde forrest, wherein you may be easily lost, wherein easily you may lose the vse of that sunne, which should both enlighten and direct you to your iourneyes end. You are trauersing through an intricate labyrinth, out of whose entaglements you can neuer winde, neuer free your feet, vnlesse you follow that pathe which GOD hath lined foorth vnto you. You a

                  e sailingin a dangrous sea; beneath paued with shelues, on euerie side walled with rockes, aboue beaten with terrible tempests. You must be not onlie skilfull, but carefull of your course; you must alwaies beare your hand on the helme, your eie on the compasse; lest it come to passe that you neuer escape.
               
                   If you doe not this for the loue of GOD, doe it then for the loue of your selues; whereunto by all rules of reason and nature you are stronglie bound. If you doe not loue or regard your good, at lest bee  not in loue with your euill: The loue of miserie is

farre worse then miserie it selfe. Assuredly, in case you continue in this carelesse course; in case you still beare your selues, either desperate in running from GOD, or dull and heauie in comming to him; in case neither his benefits can allure, nor his chasticements enforce you to a change of life: he will cast his plagues vpon you so thicke as haile; which will make you more miserable then you can imagine.

                     16 A short prayer.
                     
                  
               
               
                  CErtainely if you wil not embrace this friendly aduice; If you esteeme these warnings to be of no weight; If blinded, either with dulnesse, or with malice, you perseuere in your sinnes; If neither benefits nor scourges can hold you in obedience; If neither promises nor threats can any deale mooue you; If you can be reteined in order, neither by hope nor by feare; If, like vntamed beasts, you still wildlie runne through the thorny thickets of all vices, and esteeme euerie lustfull thing lawfull to be done: hee hath heauier hammers to breake your obstinacie, to bridle your  boldnesse and pride, and to beate downe your rebellion against him. Verely not the starres in the firmament, not the sands of the earth, not all the creatures in heauen and vpon earth are so manie in number, so vnresistable in force, as are the punishments which the obstinate shall endure. Their infelicity houereth ouer their heads; their curse traceth them step by step, vntill it shall ouertake them in hell.
               Here the most pleasant retreits are full of hideous  hurlements: nothing but terrours, torments and teares; without intermission or end. Here is griefe

without remedie, complaint without, pity, repentance without mercy. Here death alwaies liueth, and life alwaies dieth; death here & life are immortall together: life in dying and death in enduring. Here both body and soule shall eternally liue in eternall death: they shall liue together in a double death, and both eternall: the death of sinne, and the death of punishment due to sinne.
               On the other side, they who contemne the vanitie of the world, and apply themselues onlie to GOD; they who repent them of their sinnes, be they neuer so great (if they doe not despaire) shall vndoubtedlie  be receiued to pardon and mercy. For this is most easie for GOD to doe, by reason of his goodnesse, and the greatnesse of his mercies; in comparison wherof, all the sinnes of the world are nothing so little, as a point in regard of the largest circumference; as one sparke of fire in comparison of the vast Ocean. So as if the greatest sinner in the world be penitent, If he desire and sue for mercie; all the water in the sea cannot so easilie extinguish one sparke of fire, as the mercies of GOD will abolish his sinnes. Verelie if a good man will be mercifull to his beast; our good GOD will much more bee mercifull to his creature,  to his seruant, to his childe. Yea, it is not possible but that mercy should be imparted to them that repent. For the infinite mercies of Almightie GOD abound in all places, they fill all things, if they be not excluded and locked foorth. But nothing excludeth mercie but impenitencie and hardnesse of heart. And therefore, if a man be penitent, mercie

will foorthwith enter, because the impediment is remooued; because nothing then remaineth in the soule, which may resist or repell mercie. If the window be opened, the roome will be light; and if the floudgates be vnbarred, the streames will presentlie ouerflow.
               But they who haue receiued mercy, who are vnder  the protection and guard of grace, in what assurance doe they stand? how boldlie do they walke? with what confidence are they caried in all the passages of their life? Mercy encreaseth confidence, and cōfidence againe encreaseth mercy: As guiltines is the cause of feare, so from mercie proceedeth confidence: As all wickednesse is full of feare;Sap. 5. Prou. 28.1 so the iust is confident as a Lion.
               
               And whosoeuer receiueth mercie, they shall be  filled therewith: They shall be so filled, as they shall ouerflow; they shalbe enuironed with mercy on euery side. And being vnder the peace & protection of mercie, hauing firme trust that their sins are forgiuen; O good GOD! to what felicitie are they aduanced? what treasures are there in heauen, which shall not be opened and imparted to them? They shalbe placed by the side of GOD; they shall be apparrelled and adorned with so great glory; so great happines shalbe heaped vpon them, as the spirit of man is vnable to apprehend, much lesse to expresse. The desire, the hope, the full faith and assurance hereof, cannot but worke in them incredible ioy, before they attaine the full fruition; euen whilest they are vpon their passage to it. Oh! with what cheerefulnesse,

with what delight doe they either remooue or surmount all difficulties which lie before them? Howsoeuer their trauaile seemeth troublesome and hard, yet the loue of their iourneyes end maketh it, not onely tolerable, but delightfull: The onely thought of the end of their trauaile, seasoneth all the meanes with sweetnesse, through which they are enforced to wrestle to that end.
               
                   It may be conceiued indeed, that the iust are plagued, and that the wicked chiefly flourish in this life: It seemeth to be so, but it is not so. It is so onely in appearance and shew, but in very deed it is not so. They are either blinded with grosse mists of ignorance, or abused with deceiuable colours and shewes, who thinke it so. It appeareth so only to those who are so rowled vp in flesh and bloud, that they esteeme nothing good or euill, but that which appertaineth to the body. Assuredly, they whose sinnes are forgiuen, enioy the most perfect pleasure euen in this life: which in this sort doeth plainely appeare.
               As the inward vertues and faculties of the soule  are capable of greater pleasure then the outward; partly because they are more noble and diuine, and partly because their obiect is more excellent; which is, GOD himselfe and all goodnesse: So the more perfect those powers and faculties are, the more perfect pleasure they apprehend in their proper obiects; which is euident by all outward and bodily sences.
               But penitent persons whose sinnes are forgiuen, haue the inward capacitie of their soules more perfect and cleere then other men: Because nothing either

defileth or defaceth the inward vertues of the soule, but onely sinne; neither is there any meanes to purge the one, or repayre the other, but by repentance.
               Heerehence it followeth, that penitents only enioy pure pleasure in this life; as proceeding from the purest and highest faculties of the soule; much cleansed by repentance from corruptions of sinne.
               But the pleasures of the wicked proceede onely  from the outward sences, common to them with bruit beasts; and so much inferiour to the pleasure of beasts, by how much they participate of sinne. It is true indeed that their sensuall appetites present to them a thousand pleasures; but the reckoning being cast, what pleasures are they? pleasures tempered with vice, which hold them still in a restlesse feauer: pleasures sweet for a moment, but leauing a long and loathsome taste behinde them: pleasures onely to couer dangerous hookes: pleasures which carry their punishments with them. As for their inward vertues and powers, they are so dulled and dimmed, and sometimes stupefied and benummed with custome of sinne, that they affoord no pleasure at all; But either lie as sottishlie sencelesse, or else expres
                     ••
                   life only by vpbrayding the polluted pleasures of the flesh.
               It cannot bee denied, that many penitents are almost  alwaies vnder correction, that the scourge is almost alwaies vpon their backes; but heerein also I esteeme them blessed: For, Blessed is the man who is chasticed of the LORD.
                  Iob. 5.7. The reasons whereof are

mainelie two. First, for that this correction proceedeth from the loue of GOD; either as a gentle bridle, to restraine them from licentiousnesse of sinne: or as a forge, hammer and file, to consume the consuming rust of sin. For as a man will file and scoure that instrument or vessell which he regardeth, to make it bright; as beat and brush that garment which he affecteth, to make it cleane: So GOD chastiseth that person whom he loueth; either to purge, or to preserue him from the soile of sin.

                           •

                           •
                        m filium quem recipis. Heb. 12.6 If GOD scourgeth the iust; if hee debarreth, if hee depriueth them of health, riches, honour, or any other fauour of the world; it is onely for loue vnto them: It is to make them onely to loue him. For GOD is a iealous GOD, & so loueth those that are his; that he will not endure them to loue any thing but himselfe, vnlesse it be for his sake. GOD esteemeth not himselfe loued enough, if the loue of any other thing be ioyned with the loue of him. The sence of this loue of GOD doth so inflame their loue towards him, as they become sencelesse of any worldly accidents or affaires.
               
                   The second reason is, for that albeit they bee neuer so much chastised,
                     Tribulationem patimur, sed non destituimur, 2. Cor. 4.8. yet are they neuer forsaken: but in the middest of their miseries, mercy shall encompasse them. They are neuer cast off, neuer cast away; but are alwayes guarded by the mercies of GOD: the mercies of GOD wil defend them for the present, and deliuer them in very good time. For the present it doth enable them, not onely willingly, but ioifully and desirously to suffer the momentany afflictions of this life: For the future it prepareth for them an eternall

crowne of glory; to which the short afflictions of this life, are an ordinary and almost necessary passage. The afflictions of this life, are both naturally  
                  momentany, and by grace light;
                     Id enim quod in prae senti est momentaneum, & leue, aeternum gloriae pondus operatur. 2. Cor. 4.17 but the glory whereto they lead, is both eternall, and of exceeding weight. As the grace of GOD maketh the afflictions of this life light; so without that speciall grace, the nature of man is altogether vnable, either to beare, or to behold the weight of glory which shall succeed. We haue a naturall inclination to it, but all our naturall abilities & forces are insufficient, either to attaine, or to sustaine it.
               O LORD of this eternall weight of glory! Let  me suffer corosiues, cauterizes, cuttings, lancings,

The more bitter the potion is, the more medicinable and healthfull will it be: the more sharpe the file is, the lesse rust will it leaue behind. The more a garment be brushed and beaten with roddes, the lesse it remaines defiled with dust.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     VERS. XII.
                     Be glad, O ye righteous, and reioyce in the LORD: and be ioyfull all ye that are true of heart.
                  
               
               
                  
                     1. TO whom it is proper to iudge of the pleasure of the righteous.
                     
                     2 A true Iudgement touching worldly pleasures.
                     
                     3 Pleasures of the soule dilated often to the body.
                     
                     4 They who haue the fauour of GOD, haue GOD himselfe.
                     
                     5 Who are inuited to reioyce.
                     
                     6 For what causes.
                     
                     7 How gloriously the soules of them who loue GOD, sort out of the miseries of this world.
                     
                     8 Who are forbidden to reioyce.
                     
                     9 The ioy of the wicked no true ioy, and wherefore.
                     
                     
                        10 The ioy of the righteous must not be placed in worldly matters, and wherfore.
                     
                     11 But it must be lodged onely in GOD.
                     
                     12 No limits to be prescribed to this ioy.
                     
                     13 Theologicall vertues consist not in a mediocritie, like Morall vertues.
                     
                     14 The attaining worldly felicities is laboursome, the enioying often loathsome.
                     
                     15 We cannot ioy in earthly, and in heauenly things together.
                     
                     16 A short prayer.
                     
                     17 Feare and ioy, how combined.
                     
                  
               
               
                  I Suppose there are not manie, who haue not often tasted the ioy and pleasure of the soule, after some measure of repentance; but happily not sufficient to arrest a iust Iudgement of them. For when two  things are compared together, the difference is best vnderstood by the iudgement of those, who haue had best experience of both. For as a sicke man, whose palate is affected with vicious humours, cannot well iudge of the taste and rellish of meates; so wicked men, whose mindes are infected with the poison of sinne, cannot rightly iudge of the pleasure of the righteous. This is proper to them whose soules haue a true taste, not any wayes depraued.
               Now, many haue had good experience of the disposition and state of the soule, both in fruition of the

                   world, and in a penitent life: But let them say, in which they tooke the greatest pleasure. The first is tearmed by some a meere Vanitie;
                     Et vili quod hoc quoque esset vanitas. Eccl. 1.2. by others no better then dunge. All esteeme the felicities of this world, not onely vaine, but exceeding vile and base, in regard of the ioyes which succeed and proceed from true repentance.
                     Arbitror vt stercora. Phil. 3.8. Their thoughts being once acquainted with this reall trueth, they neither desire, nor regard the supplie of shadowes: They cannot but bee strangers to worldly delights;I haue taken greater pleasure in the wayes of thy cōmandements, then in all maner of riches. Psal. 119. in which they see nothing but some scattered crummes, and hungry morsels of the heauenly banket. O LORD of hostes! how great are the pleasures which they enioy, who are reconciled by repentance to thee? which albeit they be properly receiued into the soule, yet sometimes they are so great; that, as riuers encreased by the fall of raine  ouerflow their bankes, so they cannot be contayned within the soule, but are imparted also to the bodie.
                     Anima mea, & caro mea exultaue
                        
                           •
                        unt, &c. Psal. 83.
               
               I will therefore reioyce in the mercies of my GOD: I will place all my pleasure in the contemplation of those felicities, which he reserueth in his treasurie of heauen, to enrich, to adorne, to crowne the iust. This shalbe the food of my thoughts; the ambition of my highest hopes and desires. Vpon confidence that I am in the fauour of GOD, I will accompt GOD  himselfe to be mine; because his loue is mine. For to whomsoeuer he giueth his loue, he giueth himselfe; because loue is no guift, vnlesse the louer be giuen therewith. Yea, loue is no loue, vnlesse he that loueth be no lesse liberall to impart that which hee is, then that

which he hath: vnlesse I haue the partie, I can neuer haue his loue.
               To this ioy I inuite you all, who stand sworne to  the seruice of the LORD; who loue his goodnesse, who reuerence his iustice. All ye who are vpright, both in action & in hear
                     •
                  , I inuite you to two things; First, that you reioyce; Secondly, that you reioyce not in your selues,
                     Exulsaslo iusti in Domino. Ps. 32. not in any thing that the world affoords, but onely in the LORD.
               You (I say) who walke not in the crooked and craggie wayes of sinne, but in the right path of righteousnesse; who in this passage commit your selues altogether to the power and goodnesse of GOD. All you I inuite to reioyce, to power forth your spirits into ioy; and that for two causes. First, because you  enioy a sweet quiet of conscience, which is to you, a perpetuall feast. Secondly,
                  
                     Prou. 15. because you expect both an end, and a reward of all your trauailes. You expect that in short time you shall exchange the thornes and thistles of this wretched life, for the flowers of eternall felicitie; that the sweat of afflictions shall bee wiped from your faces; and that you shall bee both clothed and crowned with heauenly honour. Assuredly, gold runneth not so pure out of the flames of the furnace, to be cast into the image of some great Prince, or to serue for the ornament of some rich iewell; as the soule of one who loueth GOD, doth beautifully sort out of the miseries of this world; to behold, to participate, to be fully satisfied with the glorious presence and maiesty of GOD.
               But all the wicked I forbid to reioyce; Away 
                  
hence▪
                  
                     Noli latatari Israel quia fornicatus es a Deo tuo. Prou. 2.14. you may freely depart, because you haue no part in this ioy: you haue time little enough to lament. For albeit sinners reioyce in doing ill, and take most delight in worst things; yet is not this the  ioy that I meane. This is no true ioy, this is no ioy at all; It is only a fained and forced appearance of ioy. It is as the ioy of hypocrites, short and sowre; It is but a flash to lighten them to their death. First, because it proceedeth from an euil conscience, which hath so many thornes as it hath thoughts: alwaies pricking,
                     Sub sentibus delicias esse computabunt. Iob. 30. sometimes tearing the soule, and crying out in the midst of their mirth. Oh impure pleasure! Oh vnlawful ioy! Oh iust reuenge that must ensue! Secondly, because it is both short, and the symptome of a deadlie disease. For they ioy at their sinnes, which will eternally ruine both their bodies and soules; they ioy in that condition of life, for which they cannot sufficientlie lament. Therfore the ioy of sinners is like the witlesse laughter of fooles, when they are lashed; like the sencelesse laughter of mad men, when they either doe or suffer some mischiefe; like the sicke laughter of some diseased persons, euen when they lie at the point of death. When Dolphins leape and plaie in the sea, it is a sure signe of tempests approaching; and when the wicked sport and solace in their sins, it is an infallible argument of their ruine at hand. If Epicures reioice, who deny that GOD doth either order or regard the affaires of this world; If Athiests reioice, who are of opinion that the soule and bodie determine together; It maie beare some appearance of ioy: But when they reioice in their sinnes, who

beleeue the immortalitie of the soule, who know both the iustice and power of GOD, who know how horrible it is to fall into his hands after separation from him by sinne; It beareth no shadow of ioy; It is a plaine token of a minde, either sencelesse or madde.
               So then, it is proper to you onel
                     •
                  e (O yee righteous) to bee glad; it is neither lawfull nor possible for any other truely to reioyce. But because this your ioy is the treasure of your soules, you must in any case be carefull to place it well: As treasures must be safely laide vp, so your ioy must bee lodged safe: and that cannot be but onely in GOD. For if you place it in honour, riches, beautie, power, or any other faire fauour of this world, it cannot be safe: because these things are transitory, and subiect to variations and dangers; because they will passe away and perish in a moment. And therefore the ioy that riseth from them is neuer dureable, and many times lesse then the griefe which they cause when they forsake vs. As they who ioy in GOD, need not feare any euill, because all their euils are conuerted to their good: so should they not hope for any good from the world; because the Diuell, GODS professed enemie, is the great Prince of the world; and will endeuour to conuert that good to their euill.
               Goe too then, reioyce onely in GOD, who forgiueth your iniquities, who doeth tolerate and conceale your weakenesses, who liberally imparteth his  mercies to you. Settle all your delights vpon him, settle all your pleasures and wishes in the loue of his

goodnesse: For hee imbraceth you with a fatherly loue; and will then chiefely stand by you, when all other comforts and supports will forsake you▪ Ioyne no partener with him in the small possession of your ioy: Ioy onely in him, whom you shall alwayes finde, aboue you powerfull, beneath you plentifull, before you watchfull, behinde you carefull, on this side bountifull, on that side mercifull, on all sides wonderfull.
               Reioyce not in your owne worthinesse, but in his infinite goodnes, who driueth all dangers from your bodies and soules; who so prouideth for you, that you want nothing necessarie for this life, and doe assuredly expect blessed abundance in the life to come. Reioice onely in him, who doeth comfort and relieue you in your passage through this world, and will conduct you to the ioy of his heauenly kingdom, whereof you shall neuer bee disposse
                     •
                  sed.
                     Et gaudium vestrum nemo tollet a vobis.
                   Reioice I say, in him, who is the very Ocean of ioy, from whom all ioyes of the soule are deriued: who onely giueth true ioy, and full ioy, and perfect ioy; and ioy which shall neither end nor abate.
                     Inebriabuntur ab vbertate domus tuae, & torrente volaptatis suae potabis cos. Psal. 36. Of which ioy, the onely hope is sufficient both to refresh and sustaine vs, in all the trauerses of this life; which incomparably exceedeth, not onely all humane ioy that can be found, but whatsoeuer can be either guessed or imagined.
               
                   And therefore I will not prescribe any limits to your ioy, because it must not be moderate; it cannot bee contained in any meane compasse. If worldly ioy exceede golden meane, then is it vicious; but it is not so in spiritual ioy, no more then it is in loue, from

whence it proceedes. All morall vertues consist in a mediocritie, which is limited by prudence: But it is  not so in loue, or in any other diuine vertue. As there is no mediocritie or meane in louing of GOD, so is there not in reioicing in him. The more we loue, the more we reioyce; and the more excessiue our loue and ioy is, the more doe they draw to their perfection.
               Wherefore then doe wee not with a holy scorne, cast behinde vs the base vanishing pleasures of this world, and bend all our endeauours after these heauenly felicities? Or rather wherefore doe we, with a sleepie sensualitie, cast behind vs these heauenly felicities, and bend all our endeuours after the base vanishing pleasures of this world? Alasse!
                     Me dell querunt fontem aequae viuae, & foderunt sibi cisternas: cisternas dissipatas, quae no

                         valent tener
                           •
                         aquas, Iere 2.13. Wherefore doe wee forsake the liuing springs, and digge broken pits that will hold no water? Is it out of opinion of safetie? or is it for idle ease? Goe wee then to the dead sea of this world, let vs draw of their muddie waters of honour, riches, authoritie, or any other witcherie of the world: Certainely it will bee with great paine, with great care, and many times with great danger. And then what followeth? the atteining  of them is not so laboursome,
                     Haurietis 
                           •
                        quas in gaudio de fontibus Saluatoris, Isa. 12.3. as they are loathsome (many times) when they are atchieued. Onely out of these liuing springs, out of these sauing waters wee may alwaies draw, both with safetie, and with ioy.
               Away then yee painted pleasures of this world: mine eyes are dazeled with the blaze of too bright a Sunne, to admit the beames of your pale light: I am wholly inherited by a higher ioy, which hath taken

so absolute a conquest ouer all my powers; that neither my sence can discerne, nor my minde conceiue any other obiect. As a man cannot looke with one eye vpon heauen, and another vpon the earth; so  can hee not diuide his minde to ioy both in earthly and in heauenly things at once: hee must die to the one, if he intend to liue in the other.
               Lord, take from me all pleasure, take away all patience  in the flashie felicities of this life. Let nothing stoppe, let nothing hinder me from entring into thy house; to behold thy bright and pure beautie, to bewaile the deformitie of my sinnes, which haue banished mee so farre from thy fauour; to deplore my weakenesse, and to implore thy grace; to compose my behauiour, and d
                        •
                     spose all my abilities to doe thee seruice. O my GOD! marshall my vnruly appetites, traine them in thy discipline, binde them vnder the commaund of reason and grace. Let not my soule be chained in me, but let it aspire to thee: For in mee it is but in a prison, in thee it is in paradise.
               Reconcile and combine in mee two contrary affections;  feare and ioy. That as a tired trauailer, ranging in a wilde desert, reioyceth to see the first cracke of day; and yet is not altogether free from feare of the darkenesse and dangers of the night: so, albeit my errours past bee fearefull to mee, yet let me entertaine a sweete hope, to enioy those approaching ioyes, whereof there is neither saciety nor end. Thus cleansed by thy mercy, and furnished with thy grace, I renounce my will, I offer it a sacrifice to thee; I yeeld my selfe wholly to thy obedience. O my GOD! doe not refuse mee.
               
                  
                  Prayse, and Glory, and Wisedome,
and Strength, Dominion, Riches,
and Power bee vnto
our GOD for euermore.
               
            
            
               
               
               A SVMMARY PRAIER.
               
                  O Omnipotent GOD! most manifest and yet most secret and hid: O bountifull Giuer! and yet seuere exacter! Thou, O LORD, who sitting aboue the Seraphims seest all things, and in all things mayest bee seene:

Thou who art most powerfull, and yet so pitifull, that thou releeuest miserable and vile sinners: O most glorious & incomprehensible GOD! encline thine eye fauourably to my distresse; fauourably regard my poore petition, which breaking from a broken soule, must needs make an vntunable sound.
               There is nothing, O LORD, which my soule more desires: nothing is more due and delightfull to thee, then that I should Loue thee. Thou hast created mee to loue thee, thou hast commanded mee to loue thee; in this loue thou hast placed my felicity and my peace: In this loue consist all good things, which we enioy vpon earth, and the greatest part of those which we hope for

in heauen. But no man can loue thee vnlesse hee know thee: the knowledge of thee is necessary to beget this loue; because wee cannot truely loue thee, vnlesse wee vnderstand that all causes of loue are perfectly in thee. O true delight of our hearts! I cannot liue, vnlesse I loue thee: and I cannot loue thee vnlesse I know thee. What then shall I do to atteine this knowledge.
               The knowledge that wee haue comes by our sences; which are as gates, through which the representation of things sensible enter into our vnderstanding. But neither can thy greatnesse enter through so narrow passages, neither can wee imagine any representation, whereby our vnderstanding may apprehend

thee. Thou hast formed all creatures, in number, weight, and measure; their nature and vertues are limited; thou hast giuen them their bounds which they cannot exceed: and therefore our vnderstanding is able to embrace them. But thou art infinite: thy being is boundlesse. Nothing is aboue thee, nothing beyond thee, nothing wide of thee, nothing without thee: our vnderstanding cannot comprehend the confines of thy being. As thou art infinite in power, so art thou in nature: thy nature is no lesse infinite in extent, then eternall in continuance.
               No man hath hitherto beene able to vnderstand the essence and nature of his owne soule, whose offices and operations hee dayly discernes:

and this is because it beareth thy Image. And how then shall I be able to vnderstand thee? If my ignorance bee so dull and heauy in my selfe, how shall I be of capacity to know thee? O noble nature! O infinite essence! O incomprehensible Maiesty! How shal I know thee? For I cannot see thee. My sight is dimme, and thou art a light which canst not be approached. Thou art most high, and so must hee be whosoeuer shall attaine thee. Who then will giue me the eyes of an Eagle, that I may beholde this Sunne? Who will giue mee wings, that as a Doue I may approach this height?
               But yet will I not thus giue ouer the chase: the more hard it is,

the more hardly will I pursue it. There is no wisedome but in knowledge of thee: there is no rest but in louing thee: there is no ioy but from beholding thy beauty. I will not liue without this knowledge, which is the originall both of loue and of ioy. My eyes are dimme, yea darke and blinde: but grace will enlighten me, Grace will effect that which Nature cannot. And albeit I know thee very little and obscurely at the first, yet is it better so to know thee, then perfectly to know all things besides. Albeit I cannot fully know thee, yet will I aspire to such measure as I may, and this will I loue, and heerewith my soule shall rest content: euen as a bird is content with the water which she taketh in

her bill, albeit shee bee not able to take the whole fountaine. Yea, thy grace will assist mee, that if I shall but begin to loue thee a little, thou wilt discouer thy selfe more plainly to my knowledge, euen as thou hast sayd, He that loueth me, shall bee loued of the Father, and I will loue him, and manifest my selfe vnto him.
               
               And to this end thou hast opened two bookes, to the two eyes of my vnderstanding: Faith and Reason. To the eye of my Faith thou hast opened the booke of the sacred Scriptures; wherein thou doest manifest thy merueiles, and vnfold thy mysteries; to beget in vs a loue and reuerence of thy Maiestie.
               To the eye of my Reason thou hast opened the booke of thy

creatures; which in their perfections manifest thy beauty, and thy goodnesse in their vse. For this visible world, this fabricature of creatures is a faire Booke, wherein all men may read, and thereby learne, what thou art; euery creature being so many letters, to declare the excellencie of their maker. Some declare thy beauty, some thy greatnes, some thy power, some thy wisedome, some thy prouidence; all with different sweet sounds, in a well tuned harmony, set foorth thy goodnes and glory. They are as a bright glasse, wherein wee may behold thee: that as thou art a glasse in heauen, wherin all thy creatures are seene, so are thy creatures a glasse vpon earth, wherein we may behold and know thee.
               
                  They are trumpets of thy honor, witnesses of thy worth; bellowes of our loue, spurres to our dulnes, and Iudges of our vnthankefulnes. They alwayes beat at our vnderstanding, to instruct vs some part of thy perfections: and shall we be so senceles, that we cannot behold in them the Maiesty of their Creatour? Shall we be like witlesse children, who turne ouer bookes to please their phantasie, in viewing pictures and colours; but neither can read one letter, nor vnderstand what the pictures represent? O wasters of time! we take pleasure onely in beholding thy signes, but nothing regard what is signified and taught. Assuredly, we haue good cause to feare, that which the Wise man threatneth:

that all creatures shall rise in armes against them who will not vnderstand.
                  
                     Sap. 5.
               
               O Father of light! suffer not, I beseech thee, such an Aegyptian mist to enwrap my head, that in neither of these bookes; that neither by Faith, nor by Reason I can discerne thee. Enlighten my eyes that I may see thee; enlarge my heart that I may know thee, loue thee and adore thee: not onely by Faith, as thou hast reuealed thy 
                     •
                  elfe in thy word; but by euidence of nature, by plaine inuincible demonstration of Reason, as thou art declared by thy workes. That I may praise thee, not only for the vse of thy creatures, but for attayning by them to some knowledge of thee.
               We cannot now see thee, but couered

with the veile of thy greatnes: The dampie fogges of my sinnes wherein hitherto I haue liued, doe altogether obscure thee. No lesse then it hapneth vpon the first eruptions of fire from the mountaine Aetna; the smoake whereof so darkeneth the confining countries, that one man cannot see another. But O fountaine of light! dispell these filthy fumes, with a gracious cast of thy countenance; and then I shall be both able and desirous to beholde thee. Make mee blessed by forgiuenes of my offences; Couer my 
                     •
                  innes, O LORD, and thereby thou shalt Discouer thy selfe.
               To this end remooue both from my tongue, and from the most secret retreates of my soule, all odious hypocrisie;

that by thy grace I may sincerely, without faining or fainting in spirit, repent my sinnes: that I may applie my selfe to thy worship and seruice; not in outward shew of pietie onely, but with all the most inward sences and forces of my soule: that I may not wilfully endeuour, either to couer my sinnes by dissimulation, or to extenuate them by excuse; whence intolerable anguishes, tortures, gripes of conscience will certainely ensue. But that casting away both vnseasoned pride, and vnseasonable shame (two great impediments to repentance) I may freely lay open the very bowels of my soule, and truely touch euery vntuned string of my heart before thee: knowing right well, that the

more ready we are to confesse our offences, the more ready thou wilt bee to forgiue them; and the more diligent we are to conceale our sinnes, the more powerfull thou wilt declare thy selfe, both openly to publish, and sharply to punish them.
               In all temptations, inward or outward (wherewith my soule is dayly trauayled) defend mee with thy inuincible ayd; especially when furiously they assaile me, when tempestuously they breake vpon mee. Then O LORD, stand firmely by me, then couer me with thy mighty arme; lest ouerflowing the bankes of thy protection, they ragingly oppresse me, and driue me, like waterfloods, from all sight and sence of thee. For thou LORD, art my reliefe

in all my necessities: in all my dangers thou onely art able, both powerfully to deliuer, and safely to place me. And therefore so season my soule with thy heauenly Grace, that it settle neither confidence nor delight in any of thy creatures; but that it be fixed onely vpon thee; in whom it shall perpetually find both secure rest, and perfect ioy.
               
                  Informe my vnderstanding to know thee; Conforme my wil to obey thee; Confirme my steps in the way of thy Commandements, which will lead me to eternall blessednesse. Set thy eye of fauour vpon me; that by the gracious influence thereof, I may be both directed & strengthened in that way; and neither turne aside, nor make stay vpon any desires

or delights of the world; like bruit beasts, empty of vnderstanding.
               Haue mercy vpon all miserable men, who stiffely sticke in the mire, either of ignorance, or of false opinions, or else of worldly pleasures or cares; thinking very seldome and little, either of thee, or of their own deplorable estate; and stopping their eares to all aduice, which soundeth against their sensuality. If they will not be guided by thy gentle hand, If thy fatherly benefits or promises can nothing auaile, vse some seuerity vpon them. Put a sharpe bitte betweene their teeth; binde their iawes with iron hookes; lay the whippes of chastisement vpon their backes: Tame their vnbrideled

wantonnesse, breake their obstinate either fury or dulnesse; that by repentance they may turne vnto thee.
               Deliuer mee from the innumerable & insupportable plagues, which thy Iustice hath addressed for the wicked; partly in this life, but most especially in the life to ensue. And because I haue reposed my confidence in thee, enuiron me with thy mercies: that being free both from dangers and feares, I may reioyce onely in thee; and with purity and integritie of heart, adore and prayse thee all the dayes of my life.
               
                  
                  Prayse, and Glory, and Wisedome,
and Strength, Dominion, Riches,
and Power bee vnto
our GOD for euermore.

            DAVIDS TEARES.
            PSALME CXXX.
            
               
                  
                     OVt of the deepe haue I called vnto thee, O LORD: LORD heare my voice.
                  
                     2 Oh let thine eares consider well: the voyce of my complaint.
                  
                     
                     3 If thou LORD wilt bee extreame to marke what is done amisse: O LORD, who may abide it?
                  
                     4 For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.
                  
                     5 I looked for the LORD, my soule doeth wait for him: in his word is my trust.
                  
                     6 My soule fleeth vnto the LORD: before the morning watch, I say, before the morning watch.
                  
                     7 O Israel trust in the LORD, for with the LORD there is mercy: and with him is plenteous redemption.
                  
                     8 And hee shall redeeme Israel: from all his sinnes.
               
            
            
               
                  Of the title and parts of this PSALME.
                     1 THe title giuen to this Psalme is common to fifteene Psalmes together.
                     
                     2 Wherfore these fifteene Psalmes are entitled Psalmes of degrees.
                     3 The most followed opinion.
                     
                     4 What was figured by the stepps of the Temple, and consequently by these Psalmes of degrees.
                     
                     5 Many excellencies of this Psalme.
                     
                     6 The more deepe we are suncke into sinne, the more forceably we must cry.
                     
                     7 The degrees or steps of a sinner falling and sincking from GOD.
                     
                     8 This Psalme conteineth a plaine prophecy of the Messias.
                     9 It is a Penitentiall Psalme and wherefore.
                     
                     10 The parts thereof.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               
               THis Psalme is intitled a Psalme of degrees, or of ascending. A title not proper to this Psalme alone, but common to fifteene together: whereof the first is the 120. the last the 134. But wherefore they are termed Psalmes of degrees, as writers doe much vary in their opinions, so all agree that it is not much materiall to know: for that it pertaineth not to any point of doctrine, but to some ceremonie in singing them, whatsoeuer it was.
            
                Some are of opiniō that they are so entiled, because the Leuits or Priests did sing them in some conspicuous place, wherto the ascent was by steps or degrees. Others, that because they are very short, they are compared to so many degrees. Others, that they tooke that name from the tunes wherwith they were appointed to be sung; which might be in a kinde of graduall ascending. Others, that they serued to distinguish the parts of the diuine seruice vsed by the Iewes; and to bring the same as it were by steps to  an end. But the most followed opinion is; that they were so called, 
                  •
               ecause they were sung vpon the fifteen steps of the ascent to the Temple, at such time as the high Priest entred the Sanctum Sanctorum.
            
            Now, because (as Saint Paul saith) all things happened to the Iewes in figures:1. Cor. 10. these steps of the Temple,  and consequently these Psalmes of degrees, are a type and shadow of our ascending to the eternall

Temple and habitation of GOD: which is not by a start, but by many degrees; rising alwaies from one vertue to another, vntill we arriue at the happy end of our hope; euen to the vision of Almightie GOD. The same also was figured by the ascent to the glorious seat of Solomon, which consisted of six steps or degrees.3. Reg. 10. And likewise by the ladder which the strong wrestler Iacob saw in a vision, extending from earth to heauen,Gen. 28. which could not but consist of very many steps: wherby we are giuen to vnderstand, that no man can attaine this happy height, no man can climbe the ladder, at the top whereof the LORD doth stand; but by degrees of many vertues, whereof euery one hath many steps. But hereof more shall be said vpon the sixt verse of this Psalme.
            
            This is an excellent Psalm for any man who is charged with crosses and calamities of this life. For it leadeth vs to the true cause of our calamities; namely our sins. And therby directeth vs to the true remedy; by crying to GOD. Not vpon trust of any worthines or worth in our selues; but vpon humble acknowledgement of our miserable weakenesse; & trusting only in the mercy of GOD (whereof he hath made many liberall promises) and in the vnmeasurable merits of our Redemption. It further teacheth vs, to expect the LORD patiently; neuer to suspect him, neuer to respect any other thing. And albeit he deferre his reliefe, yet we must still preferre our complaints, and both earlie and earnestlie addresse our selues to him: nothing doubting, but that with him is mercy, that his redemption is plenteous, and largly sufficient for all our sins.
            
               
                But the more deepe we are sunke in sin, the more forceably must we cry: euen as the more inueterate a disease is, the more strong must be the medicine. For assuredly, as the righteous approaching daily to GOD aduance into heauē by degrees; so sinners falling from GOD, since downward by degrees, into many deepe dangers: and the deeper he sincketh in sinne,  the deeper he diues into danger, vntill at last he plung  into the horrible pit of hell. The first step of his deep falling, is a deliberate consent to motiues of sinne.  Next ensueth his busie endeauour in searching time and opportunitie to accomplish the sinne. And then  it is time to cry vnto GOD. After this the act followeth;  and that requireth a greater crie. Then frequencie of acts draweth into custome; and the longer the custome hath beene, the deeper is the descension (albeit the sinner be not alwaies sensible thereof) and the harder is he to bee raised againe: euen as a beast lying in the mire, although it seemeth to lie at ease, yet the longer it lyeth, the deeper it sinketh, and the more hardly can it struggle foorth: And therefore this degree cryeth for a vehement cry.
            
                Now beneath this another followeth, when the sinner reioyceth and boasteth of his sinne; and then he is sunke exceeding deepe, beyond the bounds of feare and of shame: two strong reines against disordred desires. When the Diuell hath gained this point of a sinner, hee hath then brought him into a sad and sencelesse securitie, he is then so farre from crying to GOD, that scarce any cry will stirre him.
            
                The next ensueth, when the sinner will defend his

sinne, and endeauour to make others to be of his manner; and whosoeuer falleth into this profunditie, he falleth thereby into contempt. He contemneth GOD;
                  Impius cum in profunc
                        •
                      malorum venerit, contemnit. Pro. 18. he contemneth his own soule, he contemneth al remedies, he contemneth all meanes of his safetie: he will not suffer on any condition the grieuous sores of his soule to be touched. This sinner the Diuell claspeth close in his armes; he holdeth him fast locked in his power, imprisoned vnder his streight arrest. This sin requireth a hideous cry. Out of this depth the next  fall is into despaire. This is not onely a very deepe pitt, but a great stone rowled ouer the mouth;
                  Non credit quod de tenel
                        •
                     is riuersi possit in lucem, circum
                     
                        •
                     pectans vndique glatium.
                so as any cry can hardly be heard. Of all sins this maketh vs most of the condition of Diuells, who euer despaire to be forgiuen. This is the verie mouth of hell: from hence there is no fall but into the inward entrailes of hell, out of which no crie shall euer be heard.
            This Psalme conteineth an euident prophesie of the  Messias; in setting foorth his plentifull redemption, and that he should redeeme Israel, that is the Church, from all their sinnes. Which wordes in full sence were vsed by an Angel to Ioseph in telling him,Math. 1. that the childs name should be IESVS: because hee shoul
                     •
                   saue his people from their sinnes. It is rightly ranged among the penitentialls; and is fit to be seriously said  by such, as weakely sincke vnder the weight of their sinnes, as are feeble spirited against the terrour o
                  •
                GODS Iustice, as are either inwardly or outwardly lashed for their euill, and are readie to faint vnde
                  •
                
               
                  •
               he sad charge of griefe and of feare. Because these can find neither comfort nor hope in rigid and seuere

Iudgement; let them out of the depth of their miseries, out of the depth of their sinnes, and from the depth of their hea
                  •
               ts implore GODS mercy; without any confiden
                  •
               e in themselues▪ but onely in his goodnesse, and in his plentifull redemption. For albeit the Psalme beg
                  •
               nneth with extreme anguish and anxiety of minde, yet it endeth with cheerefull assurance and trust.
            The whole Psalme falleth into two principall parts, and those againe into others, as in the Table following appeareth.

                     24 When we must giue ouer weeping.
                     
                  
               
               
                  O Iust GOD! no lesse terrible in thy iustice, then vnresistible in thy power and will: when I descend into the secrets of my conscience, and call my memory to an accompt; I find my selfe plunged very deepe in sinne, and the yoake of the Diuell so heauy vpon me, that I am not able to lift vp my loaden head; scarce able to aduance my voice vnto  thee. LORD, I haue grieuously sinned against thee; I haue grieuously prouoked thy wrath against mee. I haue not onely foolishly disobeyed thee, but proudly rebelled against thee. I haue forsaken thee, and delighted to liue among bruit and sauage beastes; I made my selfe a bed of thornes; I slept among hornets and scorpions: amidst these torments and dangers I expected rest. I am as one most wretchedly wrecked; who hauing lost all his rich loading, hath hardly escaped naked to the shore.
               
                   My sottish soule poysoned with taste of things sensuall, hath taken pleasure to wallow in impure

thoughts day and night, as swine take pleasure to wallow in mire, or dogs in carion: insomuch as nothing else hath beene delightfull; nothing else easie for me to do. But I haue found this liquerice liquor to resemble milke; which is sweete in taste, but soone groweth sowre, and readily conuerteth into hurtfull humors. These beginnings were neglected, and happily contemned at the first; but since they haue prooued the sparkes of that flame wherin I consume, the seedes of all my huge haruest of sinne.
               As for my words, I will not say with the Prophet, 
                  Woe is me that I haue beene silent:
                     Vae mihi quia tacui. Es. 6. but woe is me that I haue spoken; because I am a man of vncleane lips. But oh! that a coale, or rather a ball of fire would flame from thy Altar, to scoure the rotten rust which hath deepelie ouergrowne all the instruments of my speech. Alasse! how many vaine and foolish, how many false, how many foule things haue I belched foorth of this vnsauorie mouth, wherewith I now offer to speake vnto thee? How hath my tongue galloped to destruction, euen vpon credite? euen for companie and fellowshippe of others? without any sensible pleasure or profit to my selfe? O my GOD! who will endure the breath from a man, whose stomacke hath bin stuffed with onions or garlicke? or if it were possible the fountaine were pure, yet the poisonous passage must infect the waters. I know not how to speake vnto thee, either pleasinglie or without offence; but (me thinkes) I heare thee hourelie thundering against me: Wherefore doest thou presume to assume my Name within thy leprous lips.
                  Psal. 50.
               
               
                  
                   Touching actuall sinnes, I haue so heaped them together; I haue so runne like a blind man, stumbling and tumbling from sinne to sinne; I haue so descended the steps of sinne, from one degree to another; from foolishnesse and leuity, to carelessenesse; from carelessenesse, to boldnesse; from boldnesse, to contempt; from contempt, to a brauerie and boasting in my sinne: I am so fallen from frequency of actions, to custome; from custome to habite; from habite, to nature: that I am now plunged in the deepe gulfe of sinne, which hath no bottome, but the bottomelesse pit of hell.
               
                   Out of this gulfe it is impossible for mee by the force of my owne armes to wrestle. Flattering Dalilah, euen the whorish daliancies and pleasures of this life, haue cut away the haires of my strength. And now the infernall Philistins haue made me captiue; they haue put out the eyes of my vnderstanding, they haue fettered me with many cords and chaines of wilfull transgressions; they haue throwne me into the dungeon of habite and nature; Insomuch as I haue not more naturally desired to eate drinke and rest, then to sinne: they haue made me scornefull and odious to all the world.
               
                   This depth of sinne hath drawne vpon me another depth; and that is of afflictions and calamities, the attendants of sinne: For sinne onely prouoketh thy wrath, and thy wrath draweth many punishments vpon vs. As sinne is the onely cause, so are punishments the effects of thy wrath. Impiety and impunitie goe seldome together; thy wrath will not

permit them quietly to concurre in one subiect. Punishment is so naturall for sinne, that if sinne bee not smitten with the sword of chasticement in this life, it is in danger to be smitten in the life to come, with the sword which guardeth the passage into paradise.
               For this cause thy hand hath beene exceeding heauy vpon me. My indignity hath stirred thine indignation: I haue sinned and thou hast smi
                     ••
                  en. I am inuolued in troubles, as in a deluge; the storms of disquiet beat stifly vpon me. I am so deeply drowned in aduersities and miseries, that I am scarce either bold or able to looke towards thee.Psal. 42. And yet One depth calleth another.
               
               For these depths of sinne and of calamities, haue  drawne vpon me another depth of astonishment and trembling. For when I call to my consideration thy infinite hate against sinne, the extreame seueritie of thy iustice and rage of thy wrath; neuer incensed but by sinne; and the greater the sinne is the more incensed. Terrour seazeth vpon my soule, and it faintlie sincketh into the darke and deepe cauernes of anguish, dread and almost despaire. It is no ordinary matter that doeth perplex me, not the crosses and trauerses of this world; but being oppressed with my owne guiltinesse, and sharply assaulted with the terrour of despaire; I haue iust cause to feare, that thou hast vtterly forsaken me, that thou hatest and abhorrest me for my sinne. These troubles are most terrible, these touch not my externall affaires, but the internall and eternall state of my soule. Against external
                  
calamities some remedies may be found; but against internall biting of vniust sinnes, and expectation of thy iust and eternall reuenge, there can be found neither remedie nor rest. This wound is incurable but by thy hand.
               
                   And now againe these depths haue called another depth. For it is not with a lofty looke, not with a careles & negligent conceit, but out of the depth of humility; & sorrow that I cry vnto thee. A little sorrow is not sufficient for me, my sorrow must be great; so great as it may make a great sound in thy eares Whosoeuer cryeth to thee with great sorrow & griefe, may wel be said to cry, Out of the depth. But this cry must be soft, without noise of words; it must be in the secret retreits ofthe heart; no voice, no soūd in any wise added. Contrition is an inward griefe, seated in the heart, it neuer breaketh forth before confessiō; confession must open a passage for it. This sorrow hath depressed my sincking soule down so low, as it seemes to be led through all the torments which vnrepentant sinners must endure: So as out of this depth also I cry vnto thee. Oh! that I could meet thine Angell in this fierie valley, as the children of Israel did in the valley of weeping;I
                        •
                     dic. 2. that I might extinguish these flames with my teares, that I might turne them into riuers of teares.
               
                   Lastly, not onelie from the outward gates of my lips, not onelie from the vnstable wagging messenger of my tongue, apt vpon euerie sudden passion to riot (for I am not one of those who honour thee with their lips but their heart is farre from thee) but out of the depth of my heart,Es. 22. from the very bottome of a

troubled soule I cry vnto thee. Assuredly,
                     Profundum est cor hominus. LORD purge me from my secret sins. Psal. 25. the heart of man is exceeding deepe, it hath many hidden roomes and retreits. It conteineth many secret matters, whereto the vnderstanding can neuer approach; it chambreth many secret sinnes: whosoeuer cryeth from this depth vnto thee, hee fetcheth his cry farre; he cannot but make a forceable battery against thine eares.
               Out of these depths, of sinne, of afflictions, of astonishment  and feare; out of the depth of humility and sorrow; and out of the very depth of my heart, I cry vnto thee. As Ionas cryed to thee, not only out of the depth of the sea, but out of the depth of the whales belly; so out of all these depths I stretch forth my voice to thee for helpe. I cry not for helpe to the world, I want no externall comforts; and none can giue internall but thou. Alasse! who will aske an  almes of a begger? what comfort from confusion; what comfort from them who no more vnderstand one another, then did the builders of Babell? Itis the world which hath betrayed me, it is the world which hath vndone me. It setteth vs to gather strawes, as Pharao did the children of Israel; and scourgeth vs when we haue done. I will not cast the Anchor of my rest in the stormy vnstable sea of the world. It is like a beautifull flower, but stincking: like a faire reede, but of no strength. It is rightly termed an hypocrite: without faire, but within full of corruption and vanitie: In sensuall matters it seemeth good, but all is nothing but painting and lies. Caine who was the first builder of a city vpon earth, was the

first man who lost his habitation in heauen.
               
                   But onely vnto thee doe I call, who art both enclinable to heare, and able to helpe. Being buried and lost in these bottomlesse depths, I find nothing in the world, but terrours and despaire of reliefe; nothing in my selfe, but trembling and dismay: no hope of help but only from thee. And therfore with all deiection of soule I addresse my spirit to call vpon thee. I beseech thee most gentle Father, heare my voice: Let my humble prayer ascend, from the low vale of miserie and teares, to thy high throne of maiesty and glory: let the secret groanes of my soule, and the open cries of my voice haue accesse to thy presence: heare (I say) the inward sorrow and griefe of my heart, and the outward confession of my mouth.
               
                   I haue grieuously offended thee; by shaking off thy subiection, and bearing my selfe rebellious against thee: by exposing my selfe to all euill, and opposing my selfe against any good. When thou wert to me as the sunne is to the earth, infusing heat light and life into it; I was to thee as the earth is to the sunne, sending vp grosse vapours, whereby tempests  are raised and the sunne obscured. I haue offended other men, either positiuely by wronging some in their estates or estimations, and by wringing and inclining others by my example to euill; or else priuatiuelie, in not affoording them that good, which both by actions and examples I might and should.  I haue offended the blessed Angels and Saints; who are no lesse grieued at sinne, then they ioy at conuersion from sinne: who as they ioy at the conuersion
                  
of sinners, so are they sorrowfull at their conuersation in sinne. I haue (which is strange) offended hell. For the more the multitude of the damned are, the  more doe their torments increase. For which cause the rich man intreated Abraham to send Lazarus to conuert his brethren:Luke 16. not for any loue to them, but that his owne torments by their damnation should not be enlarged. I haue offended all creatures, by diuerting  them from their proper end. For when man by sinne is turned from GOD, whilest other creatures serue him, they are also turned with him from GOD. For they were created for the seruice of them who should serue GOD: but they are diuerted from this their proper end, when they are seruiceable to them who serue not GOD. For which cause the Apostle saith; that all creatures expect when the sonnes of GOD shall be reuealed: and that they groane with vs and trauaile in paine.
               
               But especially I haue offended against my owne  soule: which being dispoiled by sinne of the grace and fauour of GOD, remaineth blind, naked, wounded, poore, pitilesse and miserable. Assuredly, it is true that no man is hurt but by himselfe. For onelie sinne (our owne viperous brood) is properly euill; take away sin, and all externall euills produce good effects. Because when sinne is away, GOD is present: but when the soule is possessed with sinne, all good things perish, all euils flourish and ouergrow. And as sinne is an offence against GOD and against all his creatures, so by sin we incurre the hostility of GOD and of all his creatures: wherof Ismael was a type,

of whom it is sayd: that his hand was against all, and the hands of all against him.
                  Gen. 16.
               
               Therfore O LORD, sweet and gentle to all them who call vpon thee, I haue great cause to call to thee alowde: but in vaine shall I call vnlesse thou heare me; vnlesse thou encline thy mercifull eare. Heare mee O LORD,Exo. 22.23. 2. Sam. 22.7. 
                  Who hearest the afflicted and troubled calling vpon thee; heare my voice; giue mee strength so to cry to thee, that my voice may be heard. For as all the droppes of raine which fall vpon the earth, are originally drawen out of the sea, which is both the fountaine and receipt of all waters: so all the goodnesse which is in man is deriued from thee; who art the foundation and receipt of all goodnesse. O Infinite goodnesse, infuse thy selfe into me: Breath foorth thy spirit, and the waters will flow. LORD, the desiring of thy graces is the beginning of obteyning them: and therefore with fie
                     •
                  ie and inflamed sighes I entreat thee. Breath foorth thy spirit, to mooue me to send to thee a full flood of boyling teares; and to crie to thee with vnspeakable groanes.
               
                   Alasse! It is the most bitter part of my misery, that I know how infinite the losse is that maketh mee miserable. I haue lost the beauty of the world; the highest marke of a good mans ambition. I haue not only lost him, but incurred his hostility, without whom there is no ioy; the breath of whose fauour is the breath of life: whose presence is the greatest felicity in Heauen,Depart from me ye cursed, &c. whose departure is the most grieuous punishment in Hell. And now, mine eyes tell

me, that euery thing is attired in sorrow; mine eares perswade me, that all sounds are tuned to mournfull notes: all things seeme to inuite mee to weepe. If I see any thing that beareth some resemblance of ioy; it is to me like the spoiles of a vanquished kingdome, in the eye of a captiue prince; scornes of his misery, and whetstones of his sorrow.
               O my LORD! I cannot hide me from thee, but I haue hid thee from me. Thou seest mee, but I see not thee. Thou seest all my actions, both light, and yet darke; but I see no beame of thy beauty; no spark of thy fauour appeareth to me. O my GOD! Why  doest thou leaue me in this distressed case? In how wilde a chase doe my perplexed thoughts wander? My vnderstanding is darke; my will either crooked or weake; my imagination, vnquiet; my appetite, disordered. I feele so many deathes, as I liue dayes. For dayly, yea hourely, my oppressed conscience enditeth me for many grieuous offences; and my owne knowledge enforceth the euidence to be true: wherupon my iudgement condemneth mee to eternall death, vnlesse a pardon can be obtayned. To this end my eyes are enioyned to a fresh shower of teares; my breast to a new storme of sighes; and my soule to remaine in the most deepe dungeon of sorrow and griefe; and out of this depth (like a most miserable prisoner) neuer to cease calling vpon thee, neuer to cease crying and crauing for thy pardon.
               O my soule! weepe bloudy teares, if it be possible: fill heauen and earth with cries, groanes and

sighes: plunge thy selfe into a sea of teares; to wash thy sinnes, and to extinguish the wrath of GOD against them: for what anger is so fierie, that teares cannot quench? as Pharao and all his hoste was drowned in the waters, so may the Diuell and all thy sins be stifled with teares.
                     Qui dolet delet.
                   The weeping for sinne is the wiping them away. Drie earth bringeth foorth vnprofitable weedes and hurtfull Serpents: and a soule neuer watered with teares, bringeth foorth much vanity and vncleannesse. As raine fructifieth the earth, so teares make a barren soule fruitfull.
               
                   Godly teares are of two sorts: some proceed from griefe for our sinnes; others from loue, ioy, and desire of GOD. Both which he so highly esteemeth, that he will not suffer one of them to be lost: he preserueth them in his treasury with great regard, to water therewith the garden of our good purposes and endeuours. For as good seedes and plants without raine, so are good thoughts and endeuours without this heauenly dew of deuotion.
               But be not satisfied, O my soule, with once or twise weeping; Bee not weary of bewayling thy sinnes, cease not to weepe,Io. 16. Hier. 31. vntill GOD shall wipe away teares from thy eyes. O happy eyes which shall bee wiped with that heauenly hand. Not only their teares shall be perpetually dried, but their sorrow shall bee turned into ioy. And according to the multitude of their sorrows, his comforts will refresh their soules.
                  Ps. 93. Goe too then, vnfruitfull soule! write all thy sinnes with teares, in the

large volume of thy heart, read them ouer againe, and againe: wash them with a few more droppes of deuotion: let thy words be watered with teares, and warmed with sighes: and againe addresse to thy suite, and say.

                  LORD, I do often ingeminate this  petition, because no plenty, no weight of words is sufficient to expresse the anguish of my soule. For it is no light either sorrow or danger that is lighted vpon me. I complaine not of the malice or fraud of my enemies, not of any wordly losse or euill; which happily may bee either auoyded or well endured. I complaine not also of sinnes esteemed of inferiour nature: not of the slippes of youth, not of imperfections of age, not of errours and escapes either ordinary or vnknowe to my selfe: against which appliances are easilie entertained. But my soule being a nest of sinne and goared with the sting of conscience, is now oppressed with such heauie cogitations, with such mortall wounds, and with such terrible assaults of despaire, that I feele that (as it seemeth to mee) which no man feeleth but my selfe: that I can see nothing▪ but that thou hast not onlie couered thy

countenance, but cast mee off, and away for euer. Great are my externall oppressions, but these are the terrours which thunder vpon me; this is the loade vnder which I labour, this is the labour wherein I sweate: euen the threats of thy Law, and guiltines of my grieuous sinnes.
               
                   Alasse! I haue lost my selfe in a labyrinth of doubts. I am in such extreame miserie, that I haue not wherewith to foster my famished soule. The violence of my greefe hath so oppressed me, that hope can now do no more; It hath done enough, in keeping my  heart from breaking. And herein I susteine the more cruell combate, because my quarrell is against my selfe: because I haue no challenge but against my own soule. Oh! that I could so hate it, as the loue of thee requires. Oh! that I were so angrie therewith, as thou mightest be appeased with me. Sometimes I haue beene desirous to run away, but then (vaine thought) I must runne from my selfe: my disease is fast fixed in my bones.
               I haue linked together the chaine of my owne miseries: I haue voluntarilie run into the awaitments of death. The enemie pitched snares in my pathes: but I despised them, and walked secure: I was violently swaied with the inclination of my appetites.  I flattered my selfe, that in youth it was a fault to be without fault: I said with my selfe; why thinkest thou vpon the end, before thou approachest the middest? Euerie part of our age, hath both errours and amendments proper to it. GOD seeth it well, but he doth not regard it: he is most easie to forgiue,

and I may heereafter conuert when I will. Thus I thought, vntill custome challenged mee for her slaue. I strugled to breake from her, but shee held me fast: I could not shake off the yoake, which had beene long buckled about my necke: I could not be ridde of the bridle, which I had willingly taken betweene my  teeth: I willingly consented, and therefore am I worthily lost.
               Whither then shall I flie? for I am fast bound, and my refuge is farre off. How shall I free my selfe from the iawes of death? from the gripes of hel? For, alasse! I finde, that there is no sinne which I haue not both seriously and sauourly committed. All my faculties both inward and outward I haue defiled; all my sences I haue feasted, I haue surfetted with pleasure: All thy benefits I haue either buried, or else abused to thy dishonour; euen as thou diddest complaine by thy Prophet,Ezek. 16. 
                  The siluer and gold which I haue giuen thee, thou diddest conuert to serue Baal.
               
               What hath beene all the course of my life, but a net of errours, a confused Babylonian building of treasons, pride, auarice, riot, lust, swearing, lying, hate, enuie, murmuring, flattering, detracting, disobedience, blasphemie, and other innumerable euils. I haue been ouerborne with the violent storm of my passions, which I haue let loose without any limits: neuer endeuouring either to abate or diuert their fury. I haue beene laced and buckled in the snares of the Diuell. I haue pursued my inordinate appetites in all things like a beast, without respect to the Law of iustice or of reason. I haue liued worse then an

Ethnick; as if I were perswaded either that there is no GOD, or that he neither regardeth vs in this present life, nor rekoneth with vs in the life to come.
               
                   My trauailing phantasies haue made a long voiage in waies both dangerous and vnknowne. Before me hath gone my aduerse will to that which is good; behind a pleasing remembrance of that which was euill: On this side want of patience in aduersitie: on that side too much hautinesse in prosperitie: On euery side, wounds and skarres stamped into the substance of my soule by custome of sinne.
               I haue often worne a burthened conscience, and yet felt no tortures within me; and therein was I miserable indeed: For therein I was either stupid or dead, I carried a sencelesse soule in a liuing bodie; euen as it must needes be a dead and senceles hand, which can hold fire without feeling any sting of heat. None are more dead then they who can beare fire in their hand or sinne in their conscience without sence of smart. But out wretches! the houre will come, when the remembrance of sinne will so much the more sharpely teare, by how much it was lesse grieuous before. Assuredlie, if we could conceiue the terror of our generall accompt, we would not faile to accompt euerie day.
               O dead sencelesse soule! where are thy complaining cries? where are thy teares, to bath the bruises which thy sinnes haue made? wherefore doth not thy leaden heart melt? wherefore doth not thy yron eies breake foorth into riuers of teares, as did the rocke which Moses smote with his rod? O LORD

GOD! sweet and gentle to all those who call vpon thee. Remember that I am but dust, and supplie (I beseech thee) my drie defects.Psal. 147.18. 
                  Breath forth thy spirit that the waters may flow: that teares of true contrition, accompanied with the saddest groanes of my soule, may plentifully breath foorth. Or if by thy iust iudgement I can finde no passage for teares of my eyes; let me not be depriued of groanes of my heart, let my heart sweat bloudie teares. Or if I bee vnworthy of that; yet let me loue groanes and teares; let me earnestly desire them; let me ardently sue to thee in my prayers for them.
               Alasse! what auaileth it that many of my sinnes are not knowen to others, when they are well knowen to my selfe. Miserable that I am, if I lightly regard this bosome witnesse: this witnesse that cannot keepe counsaile long, but will discouer my secrets to all the world. The longer time I haue liued the more I finde my life couered and ouergrowen with sinne; euen as a riuer, the further it runneth from the head, the more waters it gathereth and the greater doeth the streame encrease: or as a man riding in dustie waies, the further hee rideth the more dust he gathereth vpon him. I can finde in my selfe no light of goodnesse no calme of righteousnesse. I haue bin so loaden with the yron yoake of the Diuell, the troupes of my sinnes so muster vpon mee; that out of the depth of my miserable estate I am enforced with sighes groanes and teares to cry vnto thee.
               Oh! I am a most grieuous sinner. I thinke my selfe the most grieuous sinner in the world: I think my self

(which I tremble to speake) a more grieuous sinner  then the Diuell himselfe. For albeit the Diuell participateth of all sinnes whereto he draweth miserable men; yet of his owne nature he is not a glutton, not a drunkard, not sloathfull, not libidinous not coueteous of riches or hono
                     •
                  s, or any other worldly thing. For because nothing is affected with that which is not agreeable to the nature thereof, it followeth, that a spirituall substance cannot bee affected with goods properly corporall; but onely with those which are spirituall. But in affecting spirituall goods there can bee no sinne, vnlesse the rule of a superiour be thereby transgressed: and this is by the sinne of pride, in being disobedient to a superiour, and in affecting a singular excellencie. But consequently enuie may ensue, by enuying the good of others, whether in GOD or in man, as a hindrance to their proper ends. But so enuy must not be taken for a passion, but for a will wrestling against anothers good. And hereby it appeareth, that the Diuell properly and in his owne nature sinneth onely in pride and in enuie; which onely are pure spirituall sinnes. But besides these, I haue committed so manie other sinnes, that I am both vnable and vnworthy particularlie to confesse them; much more vnworthy to receiue pardone for them. I haue made so great ruine and waste in all the faculties of my soule, that it seemeth impossible they should be repaired.
               
                   Oh wretch! what haue I done? what did I entend to haue done: The law accompted those beasts vncleane which did not chew the cudde: not lesse vncleane

cleane are they who will not ruminate and consider, either the condition of their present state, or what in future is either necessarie or in aduenture to ensue. But alasse! I neuer thought on my danger, vntill all hope of remedie was past: I neuer regarded my steps, vntill I was in the snares of hell. And now, what death can I feare, when I haue lost the life of my soule? without which any other life is death? and which maketh death a pleasant passage to life? Being deepely wounded with the greatest griefe, what sence can I haue of ordinary euill? my deepe miseries haue drowned both my minde and my memorie in so deepe sorrow, that all hope of reliefe is ouerwhelmed with the thicke throng of present discomforts.
               And yet I will not cast downe my hope in the  LORD, I will not despaire of his gracious helpe. For he hath not cast me downe to cast mee away: hee hath not thus terrified mee, to the end I should abandone all hope, to the end I should be swallowed vp in the monstrous mouth of despaire; but rather he calleth mee to him, to the end that I should call vpon him. The first worke that the LORD did in the conuersion of Saint Paul, was the casting of him to the ground;Act. 9. whereby thou doest instruct vs (O LORD) that our deiection in our selues, is the first step of our aduancing to thee. And assuredly, thou wouldest neuer haue giuen me this grace to be sorrowfull, if thou haddest not therewith intended to giue me life.
               And therefo
                     ••
                   albeit I bee cast downe to the verie gates of hell, yet will I call vpon thee to raise mee againe: albeit I bee crushed and broken to pieces, yet

will I call vpon thee to heale mee: I can neuer bee so low driuen, neuer so ouercharged with sorrow or with feare, but still I will call vpon thee for comfort. For what other remedie haue wee feeble wretches? tossed in the vaste gustie sea of this world; beaten with most raging tempests; driuen among so many rockes and shelues, so many infernall monsters gaping to deuoure vs; what other remedie haue wee I say, but to call and crie to thee with the distressed disciples? awake LORD least wee perish. Assuredly, if out of these depths of danger and distresse we cry not out to thee for helpe, then are we neere the greatest depth that can bee; then are wee slipping into the depth wherein Cain was eternally swallowed: then are wee readie to roare out his cursed complaint: my sinnes are greater then can be forgiuen.
               
               
                   It is true, Cain, indeede thy sinne in it selfe was very great: but in comparison of the infinite goodnesse of GOD it was not great. Thy sinne might haue bin pardoned well enough, but thy opinion and conceit that it did exceede the mercies of GOD; that impious opinion, so long as it stood, could not be forgiuen. Thy despaire was a greater sinne then the murther of thy brother: thy despaire was the cause wherefore the murther of thy brother could not bee forgiuen. Thy damnable repentance left no place for repentance to life.
               The same trace followed they whom the Prophet  described to speake in this manner; Our sinnes are vpon vs,
                  Ezek. 33. 
                  and in them we consume, how then should wee liue? But O Omnipotent GOD! is this a good reasoning

with thy goodnesse? My sinnes are vpon me how then shall I liue? Desirest thou then the death of a sinner? desirest not thou rather that sinners should liue? I know rightwell that my sinnes are vpon me: But I expect againe thy mercie vpon my sinnes. My iniquities, I know, are gone ouer my head: but they haue not ouergone thy goodnesse. Pal. 38. Come to me all ye that are loaden, & I will ease you. They are a burthen too heauie for me to beare: and therefore I resort to thee, who hast promised to ease me. My sinnes shall neuer driue me to despaire, but rather to repaire to thee for reliefe.
               But is it not vsuall that GOD listneth not to sinners? that he turneth away his eare, and will not heare them? Yes verelie. But this is by reason of the cry of their sinnes; this is when the cry of their sinnes drowneth the cry of their complaints. Fauorable LORD! stop thine eare, I beseech thee, against the crie of my sinnes; but graciously incline it to the cry of my complaint. Silence my sinnes, LORD, for a while; bid them stand aside vntill I haue fullie confessed them to thee; vntill I haue manifested my contrition for them: and then let them appeare againe if they will; for then they shall not appeare alone. They shall be then accompanied with my teares and my griefe, which will abate if not abolish their crie. They shall not then prouoke thy iustice, but helpe to inuoke thy mercies for me.
               Assuredly, O my soule! the crie of thy complaint  hath no greater obstacle then the cry of thy sinnes, vntill by repentance the barre be remooued. And therefore if thou wouldest haue the LORD to heare the voice of thy complaint, first drowne thy sins with

teares of repentance, then cast away their dead carcasses from thee. Away with all the trumperies of the world; away with the vanities of pride, auarice, surfet, reuenge; away with all impediments of sinne. For vnlesse thou abandon thy vanities, thou shalt vainely implore the Omnipotent to heare thee. He cannot heare a voice proceeding from a heart and lips loaden with iniquities: he cannot be mercifull  vnlesse thou repent. Heare the condition whereupon thou maiest be heard. Let the wicked forsake his wayes, and the vngodly man his cogitations, and turne to  the LORD, and he will haue mercy vpon him.
               
               Why so thē fauorable LORD, So now I here present my selfe before thee; not proudly standing vpon my iustifications; but with a sad broken spirit, from a low deiected heart, I humbly turne, and breath forth my complaints before thee. Hitherto my daies haue I vnprofitably wasted; I haue hitherto spent my time in purposing, but neuer beginning to pursue. But now I turne and come vnto thee, stooping and staggering vnder the importable fardage of my flesh: euerie where I finde enemies, I am grieuous to my selfe both within and without. I haue many complaints to present to thee, and now sue for a fauouble hearing. Shut not thine eares, neither hold them as indifferent, but inclineable and fauourable to my petitions. LORD I acknowledge to thee all my impurities, and earnestlie entreate both thy comfort & cure. Behold how the necessitie of my miserable estate draweth sighes from my heart, teares from my eies, and complaints from my

tongue, Yeeld LORD, a fauorable eare; declare thy selfe so farre from dispising, as attentiuely to listen  to the voice of my complaint. And albeit thou beest in the highest seat of glory, and I in the lowest center of sinne, yet be pleased to heare; for no distance can hinder thy hearing, who by thy goodnesse in all places art present. The prayers of those who call vpon thee with their heart, shall neuer resolue into winde, by reason of any distance of place; because  thou art neere to all those who call vpon thee faithfully.
               And if my sinnes still thrust themselues betweene thy hearing and my complaint; If still they step forth to stop thy eares against my voice; if they still make a hideous cry, to awake thy iustice, to quicken thy wrath, to make my prayers not onlie vnacceptable, but hatefull to thee; chase them awhile with one glorious glance of thy eie; close a little thy eie of iustice, vntill I haue once againe confessed them to thee, and presented to thy gentle hearing my petition for grace. For I know rightwell, that the petitions  and confessions of penitent sinners vpon earth, are no lesse pleasing and delightfull to thee, then are the praises of thy blessed Angels in heauen.

                  HEauenly LORD! Albeit my oppressed soule lieth buried in the deepe loathsome denne of sin, yet is there no centre so deepe, but thou mayest easily affoord thy hearing. For thou fillest heauen  and earth; in all places thou art present; not onely in regard of thy power, but in regard of thy true and reall essence. For wheresoeuer any thing is, that hath a being, there art thou also, who art the cause of that being: for the cause and the effect are necessarily together; they doe necessarily cohere: the cause doeth necessarily support the effect. But after a more singular maner thou art present  with those who pray vnto thee: euen as the great Prophet Moses doeth in these words assure: What nation is so great, to whom the GODS come so neere,
                  Deut. 4.7.
                  
                  as the LORD our GOD is neere vnto vs, in whatsoeuer we call for to him.
               
               What then shall I say now I am in so neere distance before thee? Alasse! I am come to speake for my selfe; but I canne speake nothing but that which is against me. If the holy Patriarch Abraham in speaking to thee, did call to mind that hee was but dust and ashes; If hee was so humble, If hee bare such awfull reuerence to thy Maiestie when hee entreated for others; what shall I poore miserable sinner doe, when I am about to entreat for my selfe?  what? Dust and Ashes? Nay, a bottomlesse depth of sinnes and of miseries: to whom delight in sinne, the power of the diuell and the violence of custome, haue beene in stead of three cords, or rather cables, to hold mee captiue to hell.
               
                   O most high and powerfull Creator! when I turne my eyes into my selfe, when I make a priuie search in my owne conscience, I finde the multitude and varietie of my sinnes to bee such; that I esteeme my selfe vtterly vnworthy, whom thou shouldest not onely helpe, but heare: because in comparison of my sinnes, the miseries are nothing which I endure. I haue so deepely offended thee, that in reason I can expect no fauour from thee. For what day? what hower hath passed in all my life, wherein I haue not  deserued a world of torments? Insomuch as albeit thou shouldest discharge vpon mee all the horrours of hell, yet should the greatest part of my offences remaine vnpunished.
               Thou hast spared mee, but I haue not spared thee:

thou hast spared to strike mee with the sword of Iustice, but I haue not spared to smite thee with the fist of iniquitie. Thou hast shewed thy selfe a Father to mee; but I haue not behaued my selfe as a child. How shall I looke so good a Father in the face, beeing so lewd a child as would disthrone and destroy that good Father if I could? Suppose the Father will bee content to forgiue; yet it is doubtfull that the LORD will not. Hee that forbeareth his vnrulie childe, will he also forbeare his vngracious seruant? But thou art not onely a LORD but a LORD of Maiestie. A LORD must bee feared, Maiestie must bee reuerenced, both obeyed. If hee who contemneth humane maiestie be guiltie of treason, what shall bee done to him who despiseth and dishonoureth the diuine omnipotent Maiestie, alwayes iealous of derision and neglect; whose frone no creature is able to endure? Dare vile dust, subiest to dispersion by euery puffe, presume to prouoke a LORD of such terrible Maiestie?
               Therefore seeing I haue displeased so good a Father, so great a LORD, seeing I haue so lewdly wasted all the partes of my life, so notably ruined all the powers of my soule, that I am no wayes able either to recouer the one, or to repaire the other: Whither shall I turne mee? What shall I say? If I looke vpon Mercy I thinke my selfe vnworthy of the least of her fauours: If vpon vpon Iustice, I condemne my selfe to the most seuere sentence that it can pronounce. But then againe I returne to Mercy, and prostrating my selfe at het feete, with sorrow in

my heart and teares in my eyes, I thus addresse my desires vnto her.
               
                   O mild mercy! I acknowledge my self vnworthy of thee; vnworthy either to enioy, or to behold thee. But because I haue iudged and condemned my selfe, protect me that I be not arreigned at the bar of Iustice; answere thou the charge of her accusation, couer me with thy shield against her blowe; stand betweene her and me, I beseech thee. O gentle mercy! my sorrow-beaten soule applieth it selfe to thee, hoping in despaire and perseuering in hope. My sins are such as for number can not, for nature should not be rehearsed: all my teares are not sufficient to cleanse one spotte of them, or to quench one sparke of the fury which they haue kindled:Paralip. 2. vlt. Alasse! I haue sinned aboue the number of the sandes of the sea. My iniquities are multiplyed, and I am not worthy to behold the height of heauen, by reason of the multitude of my iniquities.
               
               
                   And thou, O Father of Mercy, and LORD of Iustice; whose goodnesse canne neuer bee either exhausted or diminished: I doe not intend to contend with thee in Iudgement; but I lay hold vpon the horne of thy Altar of grace. Here I rest, here onely I repose my assurance. For if thou shouldest keepe a true registrie of our sinnes, If thou shouldest exactly examine them according to the seuere law of thy Iustice; If thou shouldest perpetually reteine in mind the offences for which wee are sorrowfull, and which thy goodnesse hath promised to forgiue: If thou shouldest cast them into the ballance of thy Iustice, and weigh them to a graine; or if thou shouldest

heape them together against the triall of thy inflexible Iudgement: What then shall become of vs? Who can stand before thee? Who can endure thy heauy charge?
               For assuredly, all reasonable creatures, as well  Angels as men, considered in their proper nature, may sinne: Whatsoeuer creature participating of reason doth not sinne, it is not by condition of nature, but by a speciall gift of grace. The reason is, because sinne is nothing else but a declination from the streight rule whereby an act is to bee performed: and that as well in naturall acts, as in artificiall, and also in morall. But there is no act which is not subiect to such deflection, vnlesse the rule thereof depends vpon the will of the Agent. And therefore, because the will of GOD only is the rule of what he doeth, as not ordeined to any higher end; onely in the will of GOD there can be no sinne. In other inferiour wills there may bee; because they giue not the rule to their actes, but are to bee directed by the will of GOD; whereon they should depend, as vpon their last and highest end.
               Now in that some Angels neuer sinned, they had  therein supportance by grace; and besides, they drew no originall eyther weakenesse or corruption from those which fell. But the nature of man is so  depraued by disobedience of our first parents, that originall sinne inherent in our very substance, makes vs not onely inclineable, but headlong to all actuall sinne. Insomuch as albeit many are preserued by grace from offences of highest quality; yet all are

so obnoxious to infinite infirmities, that wee dayly slippe, wee dayly fall; that nothing is more naturall to vs then dayly to fall; that the Iust fall seuen times a day. Yea, if the best of our actions should bee exactly examined, they will appeare so full, either of staines or of defectes, that we rather merit reproofe and punishment thereby, then either curtesie or reward. All our actions are euill, and the best seeme better then they are.
               
                   And this was a principall cause, wherefore man was redeemed rather then Angels. For all Angels perished not by the fall of some; the fall of some Angels was no impeachment to those which stood; because no naturall imperfection or infection was deriued from the one to the other. But by the fall of our first parents all mankind was inuolued in destruction; as being Siens of that corrupted tree, Runnells flowing from that poysonous spring. If man had not beene redeemed, the whole stocke, race and kinde of man must haue beene damned.
               And againe; The Angels fell meerely by malice of their will; but the first man was tempted and prouoked, and his posteritie dayly fall by inclination of their Nature. Nothing is imputed to Angels but their proper sinne: but to man is imputed the sinne of another. And therefore O LORD of infinite goodnesse! Let these reasons which mooued thee to redeeme mee, mooue thee also to heare mee; let sinne no more hinder thee from hearing, then it did from redeeming. For if sinne bee an impediment that prayers cannot bee heard, neuer shall any mans

prayer approch thine eare.
               For we are all borne sinners, wee liue and we shall  die sinners, wee cannot contend with thee in iudgement, wee cannot dispute our righteousnesse against thee. If thou wilt bee onely a iudge to obserue and examine our actions, if thou wilt call vs to triall at the barre of thy iustice, of necessity we must perish: none can stand before thee and say, I am innocent. Wherefore we decline from thy court of iustice, and desire to be heard in thy court of mercy: wee stand before thy mercy: for if mercy were not with thee, sinners could hope for nothing from thee, which is a higher court then thy court of iustice. For otherwise wee  could not appeale from iustice to mercy, because no appeale can be made but to a higher court. LORD, we appeare before thy high court of mercy; wee acknowledge that all of vs are sinners, and that if mercy were not with thee, we could not hope for anything from thee. We humbly acknowledge, that we haue done nothing perfectly well; and our imperfect doing of any thing well, is no thanke to vs, it is thy free gift: but if thou close not thy eyes against our offences, we must despaire, we cannot be saued. For our life resteth in remission of our sinnes; that thou hast couered or rather buried them; that thou wilt neuer obiect them against vs. All haue gone out of the way, we are all become vnprofitable:
                  
                     Inutiles facti sunt. ps. 13. 
                  there is none that doth good, no not one.
                  
               
               But wherefore is a sinner sayd to bee vnprofitable? Verely all things are vnprofitable which serue not to the end for which they were created. Now man

was created to the glory of GOD: but a sinner so long as he remayneth in sin, is altogether vnprofitable for that end. And how should man be pure, who springeth from a rotten root? How should there not be sin in man, apparelled with filthy flesh, when his seruants were not stable, and when hee charged his Angels with folly.
                  Iob. 4.
               
               
                  
                  All the wayes of the LORD are mercy and Iustice. No other way hath hitherto been knowne to attaine felicity. By the way of iustice our great Sauiour only  hath gone: none other but hee could euer say, Which of you could reprooue me of sinne? By the way of Iustice hee hath merited for himselfe and for vs: for himselfe the glory of his humanity; for vs, Grace  heere, and heerafter Glory. But by the way of mercy all we must walke; because we haue walked in the wayes of sinne; because by nature we are children of wrath. VVithout mercy and iustifying Grace wee cannot be saued. The doore of the entrance to the Oracle in Salomons temple,
                     
                        •
                     . Reg. 6. was made of wood of the Oliue tree: which being a type of mercy, did shadow to vs, that no man can enter the holiest place, but thorow the doore of mercy.
               And albeit GOD holdeth in his hand both iustice and mercy, yet by his antecedent will, he desireth all  men to be saued. His iudgement is exalted by his mercy;
                     Indulsisti genti Domine, indulsisti: nunquid glorificatus es? Es. 26. Ps. 145.9. he delighteth to spare sinners, hee reioyceth at occasions to shew his mercy; he esteemeth himself more glorious by shewing mercy, then by exercising his power. In his mercy (if I may so speake) hee seemeth to goe beyond himself, for his mercy is ouer all his

workes. In mercie hee would haue vs like vnto him. Bee yee mercifull as your heauenlie Father is mercifull. Hee enioynes vs not to imitate  his power, whereto Lucifer proudlie aspiring was deiected into hell. Nor his wisedome;Luc. 6.36. which Adam vainlie affecting, was elected out of Paradise: but his mercie, which wee humblie practising may bee erected into heauen. As it is mercie whereof wee stand most in neede, so is mercy chiefly required of vs.
               But the readiest way to attaine mercy, is by acknowledgement  of our sinnes. He that acknowledgeth not his sinnes, acknowledgeth himselfe vnworthy of mercy, vnworthy to be acknowledged of GOD He who hideth or excuseth his sinnes, struggleth against the streames of Grace; and debarreth himselfe of all hope of pardon: he doth vainelie search after GOD, who will not search into himselfe, and freelie confesse what there he findes. Alasse! How manie are held in the yron chaines of sinne and the deuill, who neither bewaile, nor confesse, nor see their miserie? who, ignorant of their owne estate, suppose they walke a full pace the right way to heauen? Such were the Israelites whom the Prophet thus reprooued for like affected ignorance.Hier. 2.23. 
                  How canst thou say that I am not polluted? neither haue I followed Baalim? Behold thy wayes in the valley, and know what thou hast done. O blind and foolish man! who wilt endeauour to iustifie thy selfe? open thy eyes which the deuill hath closed; and behold thy wayes in the valley of thy life. Assuredly thou shalt finde it full, of contempt

against GOD, of iniuries against others, of impurities and vanities in thy selfe. Thou shalt espie many grieuous sinnes, which others happily haue espied before: thou shalt find many Monsters lurking in thy bosome, which awaite opportunitie, sharpely to assaile thee. Verily, it is a greater fault to conceale or defend a fault, then it is to commit it.
               
                   And now, (O holy GOD) now I haue confessed to thee my owne sinnes in particular, and generally the sinfulnesse of all: what wilt thou doe? how is it thy pleasure to deale with me? Shall thy wrath still contend with thy mercie against me? shall my sinnes surmount thy goodnesse? shall my sinnes be stronger to condemne me, then thy mercies to saue mee? O my hope! Are thy benefits become so chargeable to thee? doest thou loose any thing by giuing to me? Wherefore then withholdest thou thy mercy in displeasure? or tell mee: what els requirest thou from me? Requirest thou griefe? why, that is such, that I would I had died when I did displease thee. Requirest thou punishment? Loe here my poore perplexed bodie: binde it, scourge it, satisfie thy indignation thereon: but so, as thou forbearest not to affoord thy mercie. LORD! I desire not honour, not authoritie, not riches, not any thing created: all these cannot satiate my desire; without thy mercy all is pouertie. I desire only thy mercie; giue me thy mercie and I shall be satisfied.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     VERSE IIII.
                     For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.
                  
               
               
                  
                     1 THe greatnesse of GODS mercy.

                     3 The very thought of mercy hath a powerfull operation.

                     8 Three things most like to hinder mercy.
                     
                     9 Sinnes can be no impediment.
                     
                     10 Iustice can be no impediment.
                     
                     11 The ordinance of the Law is no hinderance to mercy.
                     
                     12 The goodnesse of GOD assureth his mercy.
                     
                     13 The same is assured by his Loue.
                     
                     14 His promise doth binde him to bee mercifull.
                     
                     15 His power doth also assure his mercy.
                     
                     16 Albeit wee often sinne, yet GOD is bound by

his promise to be mercifull.
                     
                     17 By reason of our sinnes, we are rather capable, then vnworthy of mercy.
                     
                     18 Wherefore GOD hath commanded vs to trust in him.
                     
                     19 A praise of GOD for his mercies.
                     
                     20 One caution to be respected, if we expect mercy.
                     
                     21 A second caution.
                     
                     22 Wherefore GOD is to be feared.
                     
                     23 Hope and feare how conioyned.
                     
                     24 Feare a temperature betweene despaire and presumption.
                     
                     25 A prayer for feare.
                     
                  
               
               
                  O Mild Father! how sweet is thy spirit? who will not loue? who  will not laud thee? Albeit thy displeasure be daily prouoked; yet it is thy pleasure, it is thy glory, not only to forbeare but to forgiue sinners: thy mercie is so great, that thou neuer desirest the death of a sinner. Thou knowing how weake we are, how inclineable to euill, wilt not try all our actions by the try touch of thy iustice; but like a gracious Father wilt dissemble many of our imperfections, and powre forth large streames from the euer-flowing and ouer-flowing fountaine of thy mercie, both to cleanse and to cure them. Thy nature is goodnesse; thy propertie is to haue mercie;

thou art easie, thou art readie, thou art desirous to pardon. No man is so readie to intreat thee, as thou  art easie to be intreated. Thou art alwaies readie to giue and to forgiue; to giue vs thy goodnesse, and forgiue vs our euill. Thou canst not denie vs thy mercie, whensoeuer we repent and turne to thee.
               This Ocean of mercie hath neither bottome nor bound; it cannot be fathomed, it cannot be surmounted. No sooner can a sinner call mercie to his  mind, but he is sencible of the working thereof. For it breaketh and disperseth the hell of remorse, which did chill his heart with astonishment and feare: the dampes of pensiuenesse vanish away; the punishment which hung ouer his head, is chased farre off. Or if any punishment be inflicted, it is not the punishment of a iudge, but the chasticement of a Father; it is both temporall, and tempered with mercie; which maketh it not onely tolerable, but easie and sweete. In this Ocean of mercy I will cast the anchor of my hope, & ride securely against al rage of wheather; here hope will hold mee firme and immoueable against all approaches.
               O heauenlie hope! whose face heauinesse cannot  endure: how wonderfull is thy sweetnesse and thy power? What louely lookes doest thou cast vpon those whom thou encountrest? what vnspeakeable ioyes doest thou kindle in their hearts, who entertaine thee? Loe, she came vnto me attended with many comforts, and with a diuine countenance and voice vsed these speeches. Come feeble wretch, I  will lead thee into the Sanctuary of the LORD, and

place thee before his mercie-seate. Come, I say, enter bouldly, I will excuse thee. Thou shalt finde him alone expecting thy comming. Away with all worldly comforts; it is no lesse dangerous for a soule to be pestred with them in time of troubles, then it is for a shippe to be ouerburthened with rich merchandise in a tempestuous sea. It is he onely who knoweth how to deliuer thee, how to saue thee: cast thy selfe on him, and he will helpe thee.
               
                   Thus shee said: but finding me heauie and little moued, her sacred lippes began againe in this manner to infuse her selfe into my dull earthy spirit.
               
                   What? said hee: doest thou any thing doubt of the great mercies of GOD? wilt thou still sucke sorrow out of euery vaine surmise? why, search the Scripture, and thou shalt there finde mercie so much extolled, so faithfully promised, and so often and strangely practised vpon sinners; that he seemeth too obstinate, who will not submit himselfe lowly to embrace sure confidence therein. But goe too. I see I must take a little more paines: I will therefore descend to particulars with thee.
               
                   Three things (if any thing) are most like to withhold GOD from exercising his mercie. 1. The greatnesse of sinnes. 2. His righteousnesse and iustice. 3 The institution and ordinance of his law. But neither any nor all these are able to hinder the forgiuenes of sins: needs must GOD be merciful notwithstanding these impediments, to such as are sorrowfull for their misse-liuing.
               
                   1. For thy wickednes cannot either extinguish or abate

his mercie, in case thou be penitent, and beare a constant mind to amend. Otherwise the condition of all men were dangerous. For when men offend, if GOD were not mercifull, if hee were hard and vnwilling to exercise his mercie, what should they doe? how should they order themselues to auoid despaire? For despaire is nothing else but want of true trust in the mercie of GOD to remit sinnes. But doubtlesse it is not so: he is mercifull, and alwaies readie to forgiue. Sunes are so farre from being an impediment to mercie, that they are the proper obiect thereof, without which mercy hath no action: for take away sinnes, and where then is pardoning mercy.
                     Omnes peccauerunt & eguerunt gratia & miseri
                           •
                        ordia Ion. 4.2. Many glorious Saints in heauen are witnesses hereof, who were once grieuous sinners vpon earth. This also did Ionas know rightwell; and for this cause he was vnwilling to bee a messenger from GOD of his wrath against the Nineuites. For I knew (said he) that thou art a gracious GOD and mercifull, slow to anger and of great kindnesse, and repentest thee of the euill. And obserue, weake sinner, whosoeuer thou art, who for the greatnesse of thy sinnes art caried downe to the gates of despaire; obserue how GOD dealt with these condemned Nineuites. Hee suspended his sentence of condemnation, and could not proceede to execution thereof, so soone as they manifested their repentance. Feare not then the greatnesse of thy sinnes, for they are not neere so great as his mercy: his mercy is farre aboue thy neede.
               2. The iustice of GOD can be no impediment. For  iustice requires no more then a recompence for a trespasse;

and forthwith the offence to be forgiuen. But  thy redemption is made, thy reckoning is abundantly paide, there remaineth nothing for thee to discharge. This redemption is of such power and grace that it not onely satisfieth GODS iustice, but winneth him to great fauour and loue. Doe but remember who is the priest and what is the sacrifice, and thou shalt finde the iustice of GOD easily answered: for it was more that GOD died, then all man-kind had perpetually perished. This is such an offering, as if euery houre, euery minute it were newly offered. And therefore it is called an eternall redemption;
                     Epist ad Heb.
                   because by it all true penitents are redeemed for euer. All therefore who are penitent, and haue a full purpose neuer to offend,
                     Ipse est propitiatio pro peecatis nostris, non pro nostris tantum, sed & totius mundi. Io. Epist. 1. and a trust by GODS grace to continue in that purpose; may bee assured that by this redemption they shalbe forgiuen. This redemption is the very strength of repentance: hereby the iustice of GOD is no obstacle to his mercie.
               3. Now touching his ordinance of the law: Of a  troth the law was fearefull and seuere; and therefore is termed the law of death: euery soule that sinneth shall die. But this seueritie is past and done. A new law is made; the law of grace, the law of mercie and of life. Repent and the kingdome of heauen is at hand. This is a milde law; but in any case the condition must bee performed. Thou must applie thy selfe to repentance in any case: GOD will not bee mercifull, vnlesse sinners repent. Notwithstanding, if at any time through weakenesse thou offend, doe not fall from him into despaire; but trust in him: sticke stiffelie

and constantlie to him: and so shall thy trust support his mercy in thee, and againe his mercy shall support thy trust: euen like a proppe against a wall, which holdeth vp the wall, and is againe sustained by the wall.
               The impediments of mercy being thus remoued, it remaineth plaine, that mercy may easily bee obtained, and that for diuers respects; and especially these:
               First, for that the goodnesse of GOD assureth his  mercy. For to one who is good, nothing is more naturall then to doe good; which is the proper action of goodnesse. But because no greater good can be done to another, then to make him good, it followeth, that it is most proper to one who is good, to make others good: to communicate his goodnesse to others, vntill he hath made them so good as himself. And this is so farre true, that the more goodnesse any one hath, the more is he enflamed with this desire, and the greater difficulties will hee vndertake to atchieue it: euen as the greater a fire is, the greater heat it casteth foorth, and the more matter it is able to consume. But GOD is so good, that in comparison of him, none other can be said to bee good:Why callest thou me good, &c. all goodnesse is attributed onely to him. And therefore the more hee exceedeth in goodnesse, the more desirous is he to communicate himselfe. As he hath made himselfe like vnto thee, so will he make thee like vnto him: hee will not cease to informe, to reforme, conforme, transforme thee dayly, vntill hee hath vnited thee to him. He communicateth himselfe to all creatures

in their degree, but in most especiall manner to man. Assuredly, it is not so naturall for light things to mount vpwards, for heauie things to draw downward, for the heauens to mooue round; as it is for the goodnesse of GOD to doe good. For the propertie of all creatures is accidentally in them; but the property to good is essentially in GOD. GOD is an essentiall goodnesse. So simple, pure and immutable is his substance, that no accident can adhere vnto it: whatsoeuer is in GOD, is GOD.
               
                   Againe, his loue may perswade thee that hee will bee mercifull. For hee did not beginne to loue thee when first thou wert borne, not when the world was created: but thou diddest sleepe in his bosome euen from eternitie.
                     In charitate perpetua dilexite, ideo attraxi te miserans.
                   His loue to thee is no lesse ancient, then the ancient of dayes; euen then himselfe: Who as hee is from eternitie, so from eternitie hath hee loued his elect. When his naturall Sonne was begotten, then wert thou adopted for his Sonne; and euer since hee hath cast vpon thee a fatherly eye; alwayes remembring what glory hee hath appointed for thee. The Scriptures much commend an ancient friend. Loe here is an ancient Friend indeed: a friend who hath loued thee from all eternitie. Verely if immemoriall possession maketh a right, thou hast now a good title to his loue; thou hast now prescribed it for thine owne: and hereby thou hast a good claime to his mercie. And because likenesse is not onely a signe, but a cause of liking and loue; hee hath formed thy soule according to his Image: for as nothing vpon earth resembleth him more, by nothing

hee canne more easily bee knowen. And hence it is that the substance or essence of the soule cannot bee vnderstood; because it is like the diuine substance, which no man in this life can vnderstand. Hence also proceedeth the admirable capacity thereof, which all the creatures and riches of this world can no more fill, then a graine of mustard can fill the world.
               And further, he hath bound himselfe by his  promise and word,
                     Conuertimini & agite poeni. temiam ab om
                           •

                   that in case thou conuert and repent; thou shalt neuer bee ruined by thy sinne. And therefore seeing GOD hath made so large a promise, seeing hee is now become a debtor of mercy, seeing hee hath made his gift his debt; Dare any sinner despaire? Say, I pray thee: What is the worst that a sinner can feare? Eternall damnation. By whose appointment? By the authority and command of Almighty GOD. But the same GOD who inflicteth this paine, hath giuen a supersedeas; hee hath giuen thee his warrant, that if thou repent, thou shalt not be damned. Take heede; they bee his wordes; they are spoken to all sinners, bee they neuer so great. Wilt thou not beleeue them? wilt thou not giue credite to Almighty GOD? verely thou must:

                   But happily thou wilt say: I know well that GOD is both mighty and true: and I nothing doubt of the performance of his word. But when hee hath once forgiuen a sinner, it seemeth to be a discharge of his promise: In case the sinner fall againe, is GOD bound againe to forgiue him? Verely yes. For GOD hath commanded vs to forgiue our brother so often as hee shall offend: and hath further added, that If wee forgiue, wee shall bee forgiuen. Whereby it followeth,
                     Remittite & remitetur vobis,
                   that if wee bee not wearie to forgiue others, GOD will neuer bee wearie in forgiuing vs: that by enioyning reuengfull man to forgiue others, hee hath therereby enioyned himselfe to forgiue them. What? Dost thou thinke that GOD will not be more mercifull then man? Shall man forgiue sooner and oftner then GOD? It cannot bee. For, because mercie proceedeth from goodnesse, and goodnesse is originally in GOD; who can be so mercifull as hee? He who forgaue 10000. talents, what may wee thinke he will not forgiue?
               
                   And therefore, Albeit thou hast sinned neuer so grieuously, neuer so often; forgiue others, and aske forgiuenesse meekely, and mercy will follow. For wherefore is remission of sinnes promised, if sinners may not enioy it? Do sinnes make thee vnworthy of mercy? No. But rather by reason of thy sinnes, mercie pertaineth to thee. Wherefore neuer distrust, but

turne to the LORD, who hath promised mercy, and who hath commaunded thee to trust in his promise.
               O the great vertue of hope! As the sunne spreadeth light and heat to all the earth, so grace streameth from her countenance to all who behold her. O sacred hope! to whose presence heauinesse dares not approach. Although the weight of sinne doeth grieuously oppresse mee, yet will I trust in the mercie of the LORD, because hope hath emboldned me, and because hee hath commanded me so to doe. But wherefore hath hee so commanded! Verely because  hee desireth to saue mee; for so hee hath sayd: Because he trusted in me, I will deliuer him.

                         in eo. Psal. 37. in fine.
                   O most mercifull LORD! With what wordes shall I prayse thee for thy exceeding mercies, who doest deliuer vs for no other reason but because wee trust in thee. LORD, thou art in greatnes infinite, in vertue Omnipotent, in goodnesse chiefe; in wisedome inestimable, in counsailes terrible, in iudgements iust; in cogitations secret, in word true, in workes holy; in mercy plentifull, patient towards sinners, and pitifull when they repent. For such I confesse thee, for such I praise and glorifie thy Name. Powre, I beseech thee, thy light into my heart, and thy words into my mouth; that my thoughts may alwaies meditate on thy mercies, and that my tongue may ouerslow with praises for the same. That I may not only in my selfe be fruitfull of thankes, but stir vp others to doe the like. O giue thankes vnto the LORD, for hee is gracious, and his mercy endureth for euer.
                  Ps. Vid. 
                  O giue thankes vnto

the GOD of all GODS, for his mercy endureth for euer. O thanke the LORD of all LORDS, for his mercy endu

               But take heed, O my soule! For reuerence of the dreadfull maiestie of GOD, beware of two things, whereof hope hath not forgotten to giue thee warning. One is, that thou expect mercy onely from the LORD: for with him is mercy. Trust not in any worthinesse in thy selfe, who art a dunghill couered with snow; a filthie vessell, which corrupteth all liquors that are powred into it; a barke set in the gustie sea of this world, beaten with all stormes and incursions of weather. Trust not in any trumperies of the world: for no quiet can be expected from that which is alwaies in motion and change; which is alwaies busied like the spider, in making artificiall nets to take flies. If thou pursuest the comforts of the world, thou art one of those of whō the Prophet Ieremie speaketh,

                   that they should serue strange gods, who would not suffer thē to rest day nor night. Assuredlie, the conscience shall neuer find comfort nor rest, but when altogether stripped of all other confidence, it committeth it selfe naked to the mercy of GOD.
               
                   The other is, that hereby thou beest not imboldned to sinne, but rather held in bridle by feare. Vpon any condition be not bold to sinne, because the mercy of GOD is readie to forgiue: If therby thou beest imboldned, thy transgressions are the greater. Feare alwaies to offend such inuincible mercy; feare the iustice which will punish the contempt of that

mercie. Feare to offend thy iudge: feare to offend him who onely is able to pardon thy offence. Prostrate thy selfe, and liue in awe of 
                     •
                  hat maiestie, in whose mercy thou hast placed thy hope; respect him with dutie, from whom thou expectest all thy good. As thy desires are guided by hope, so let them be followed with feare. The more thou hopest, feare the more; both at one time, and without measure in both. Neither feare abating hope, nor hope enfeebling feare: But maugre all feare, let thy hope mount to the highest pitch; and maugre all hope, let feare stoope to the lowest downe come.
               If any other could forgiue sins, then thou mightest  happlyappeale to him, and the more lightly esteeme the maiestie of GOD:
                     Qui
                           •
                         potest facere mundum de immundo? tu quisolus

                           •
                        . 14. but because this iudiciary power resteth onely in GOD, because he hath shut vp all within mercie; thou must needes feare him, and tremble to offend him. If a souldier hath offended one captaine, he may serue vnder the colours of another: He who hath lost the fauour of his king, may liue vnder protection of another, euen as when the Gentiles conceiued that one of their gods was offended with them, they endeauoured to reconcile the fauor of others. But when thou shalt offend thy only omnipotent GOD, to whom wilt thou resort for reliefe? Who will not feare the king of nations? who,Hier. 10. albeit he aboundeth with mercy, yet is not he disarmed of iustice. Albeit grace reigneth with him,
                     Ego sum, ego sum ipse qui deleo iniquitates tuas propter me. Es. 53. yet is not the law abolished. Thou must liue in feare not to offend the Law, but to trust to be saued only by mercie. The Law must continue for a holy obedience,

                   to those who beleeue to be saued by mercy. By this meanes hope is alwaies accompanied with feare; hope apprehendeth mercie in the end, feare bridleth offence in the passage to the end.
               Of the righteousnesse of the Law, nothing can follow but either despaire or presumption; in the first whereof the deuill was plunged, but the nature of man is most inclineable to the second: feare is a temperature  betweene them both. To this vertue despaire is contrary on the one side, and presumption on the other. Despaire hath too much feare, presumption too little: take away both, and feare will remaine, accompanied with hope. If thou fearest without hope, thou sinckest into despaire; and art like some miserable worldling, who forsaking some part of his estate, departeth with his life. If thou hopest without feare, thou mountest like Icarus to thy deadly downefall. To feare GOD is to reuerence and worship him: to acknowledge that he is plentifull in mercie and goodnesse. Take away mercie, and take away feare: for he that expecteth not good, feareth no euill.
               
                   O LORD of all mecy! Grant I beseech thee, that my soule may feare thee; because thou art no lesse worthy of feare then of loue. For as thou art a GOD of mercie, so thou art a GOD of maiestie; as thou art infinitelie mercifull, so art thou infinitely iust: as thy workes of mercie are innumerable, so is there no number of thy workes of iustice: And (which is most fearefull) the vessels of wrath doe farre exceed the vessels of mercy. And therfore (O LORD) so work

in my heart, that I may feare thee; for the height of thy iustice, for the depth of thy iudgements, for the glory of thy maiesty, for the immensitie of thy greatnesse and power; for the multitude of my sinnes, for my inconsiderate boldnes in sinning; and aboue all, for my rebellion in resisting thy holy inspirations.

                  BVt how long wilt thou suspend thy  mercie and grace? How long shall I bee as if I were, either not remembred, or little regarded? how long shall this hungry appetite torment my soule? looke vpon me, O LORD, and let me haue some sence of thy mercie. LORD, I desire not the aboundance and dainties of thy children, but will remaine satisfied with a few cast crummes from thy table. Behold LORD I come to thee, as a poore hungrie whelpe, to a rich mans table: I see what thou eatest, and how richlie thou feedest thy children. I looke thee in the face, I obserue thy countenance, I manifest my desires by all the gestures and behauiours I can; I vse many prouocations to moue thee to bestow some meane morsell vpon me. But when, O LORD, when wilt thou regard me? Now, gracious GOD, euen now I pray thee, to fauour me

with some crummes of thy loue, wherto with all my soule I aspire.
               
                   But stay, impatient soule, be not so violent in thy desire: GOD hath long expected thy repentance, and canst thou not a while expect his mercie? As he hath delayed his anger, so it is reason thou shouldest awaite, albeit he delay his fauour. Hee was slow to wrath, and wouldest thou haue him sodaine in mercie? He did not presentlie strike when thou diddest offend, he did not make payment ouer the naile: and must he needes at the very first presenting thy selfe applie himselfe to thee? He hath a long time bin calling thee to repentance, and thinkest to thou haue his mercy at the very first cal? How often hath his iustice taken the whip in hand, to chastice thy sinnes? but mercie hath met her, and wrested away the scourge. If iustice had continued her course, no house of Aegypt, no habitation of sinners, but had rung with loude lamentation for their dead: and wouldest thou haue all his graces at pleasure and command? Iustice hath proceeded slowlie, that sinners might haue time to repent; and must mercie  foortwith gallop to them? Nay, soft; sodaine repentance is not alwaies sincere; if it be sincere, it will be of coutinuance: shew the sinceritie of thy repentance by thy perseuerance: perseuere, and doubtlesse thou shalt obtaine.
               
                   In case GOD deferreth to heare thee, it is for one of these three causes.Hope deferred is a fainting to the soule, but when the desire commeth, it is a tree of life. Pro. 13.12. Either to make his gifts more highly esteemed: or else because he delighteth in thy companie; because he taketh pleasure, that

thou shouldest conuerse with him, talke with him, sue to him; because he so delighteth in thy resort to him, as hee will not loose it by a speedy dispatch. Or else it is because he entendeth to giue to thee in a larger measure. He stoppeth the streames that the waters may swell: but in the end he will powre them foorth; not as it is fit for thee to aske, but as it is fit for him to giue.
               Or happily thou art deceiued (O blinde soule) he seemeth to delay, when hee doeth but expect the most conuenient time; when he doth but await, vntill thou beest ready to receiue. Assuredly, GOD is so mercifull, that he doeth not onely heare sinners who wait for him; but he calleth vpon them, hee awayteth to be entreated by them. Obserue what hee sayth, Behold, I stand at the doore and knocke; If any man heare my voice and open the gate vnto me, I will enter into him and suppe with him, and he with me. Listen, I pray thee, how strongly hee knocketh, how loud hee calleth. Runne; open to him the gates of consent of thy will; open thy doores which the loue of this world hath barred against him. Away for shame. VVhat? wouldest thou suffer any meane friend to stand thus long wayting at thy doore? List: list. Out vpon thee! there  is such a hideous noise within thee, that thou canst not heare. Auarice, ambition, pride, enuie, hate and a thousand worldly cares, keepe such a yeelping with their monstrous mouthes, that the sweet voice of the LORD cannot be heard; thy hearing is stopped by their horrible howlings, as if it were with a ring of belles at thy eares. But if thou wilt heare his calme 
                  
calling, silence these hagges, quiet thy disordered desires, banish the choaking cares of this world; resigne thy will, keepe silence and peace within doores; and then thou maiest say with holy Iob:
                     Vocabis me & ego resp
                           •
                        ndebo tibi. Iob. 15 
                  Thou shalt call me, and I will answer thee.
               
               Neuer feare that he will proue a chargeable guest;  he bringeth all his prouision with him; he will richly feede and feast thee of his owne. VVhen thou hast but once tasted of his fare, thou shalt neuer hunger more after the course seruices of this world: his banquet only, as well for daintinesse, as for plenty will largely suffice: Open thy mouth wide, and he will fill it. Not the mouth of thy body, for a small thing may fill that: but the mouth of thy soule, namely thy desire; which nothing can fill but GOD. VVhen GOD had created man according to his Image, the Scripture sayth, that he rested from his worke; hauing finished his perfectest piece: in whom it seemeth that heauen and earth were knit together. And certainly, a reasonable soule created after the image of GOD, hath no rest but in GOD;Who filleth thy mouth with good things, Ps. 103. the appetite thereof will neuer rest in any other thing. The vessell which is capable of GOD cannot be filled with any other substance. A soule is no more satisfied with bodily matters, then a body can be satisfied with winde: because there is no conueniency between the one & the other.
               
                   O my soule! bee content patiently to looke and wait for the LORD, as hee hath looked and waited for thee.4. Reg. 2. Doe not as Heliseus did, when hee smote the waters with the mantle of Elias: and because they deuided not at the very first stroke, hee began to distrust

and sayd, Where is the GOD of Elias? Bee not like the Leopard, which if it taketh not his prey at two or three leapes, giueth ouer the pursuit. This is a common disease of the sonnes of Adam, if they haue not releefe presently from GOD, they resort to the world, and sometimes (with Saul) to the Diuell for helpe. But thou, O my soule, perseuere with patience: fasten thy thoughts vpon the end,
                     Si moram fecerit expecto cum, quoniam veniens veniet, & non tardabit, Habbac. 2. without regard what happeneth by the way. What auayleth it to haue a goodly hope of haruest in the blade, if it be blasted or otherwise destroyed in the eare? What profit is it that trees blossome fairely, if they neuer atteine perfection in the fruit? The Crabbe is easily taken, because it creepeth forward, and backward, and euery way: so they who sometimes sinne, sometime repent, then sinne againe, are easily made a prey to the Diuell. But they who wayt on the LORD shall renue their strength; they shall mount vp with wings as Eagles: they shall runne and not be weary, they shall walke and not be faint. Esay 40. in fi.
               
                  Wait therfore, and looke for the LORD, with constancie  and fortitude, to the end of thy life, to thy very last breath. VVisedome is the eie of life, patience the staffe. Take this staffe in thy hand and walke on thy way; thou shalt neuer giue ouer, neuer be weary, but cheerefully looke towards heauen, and say: As the eyes of seruants looke vnto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a mayden vnto the hand of her mistresse: euen so our eyes wayt vpon the LORD our GOD, vntill he haue mercy vpon vs. Ps. 123.
               If any man wrong thee, swallow it with patience,
                  
for vengeance is the LORDS: In case thou reuenge,Rom. 12. the LORD shall finde nothing to chastice. VVhen Mary Magdalene was vniustlie reprooued by a censorious pharisee; she held silence; but what lost  she thereby? The LORD tooke her part, and answered for her. If trifling troubles be cast in thy way, neuer regard them: they are but tokens of loue which GOD disperseth amongst his friends. Pitch be it neuer so blacke, beat it to powder and it wil turn white: there is no sinner so Aethiopian blacke, but by the blowes of aduersitie will change his hue. VVhat? knowest thou not that holy men, the ancient worthies of the world, sailed for the most part with the winde in their face? And haddest thou rather be euer without GOD, then with aduersity to attaine him? A good rider will exercise his horse daily, to keepe him in breath, and to holde him able to performe good seruice: and so GOD dealeth with those whom hee hath conuerted to his seruice: A Bee drowned in honie, put into vineger reuiueth aagaine: and so GOD dealeth with those whom hee intendes to conuert. Their soules stifled in the pleasures of this world, must with sharpe medicines be reduced to life. Both those must patiently looke and wait for the LORD.
               
                   Patience is a great part of discretion; An impatient sicke man maketh a cruell Physition. It is a preseruatiue of other vertues: as ashes preserue fire from extinguishing, so patience preserueth other vertues from languishing and decay. Other vertues without patience are like desolate and friendlesse widowes.

Patience is a hid treasure, deepely couered with silence; It is a most acceptable sacrifice to GOD.Heb. 10.36. without patience wee shall not enioy the promises of GOD: without patience wee enioy not our selues:Ye haue need of patience, that yee may enioy the promise. Luke. 21.19 For without it we haue neither dominion nor possession in our owne soules: because by patience we possesse our soules.
               
               But patience must bee coupled with trust: which rightly laide vpon GOD hath euer beene in steade  of merit. For it giueth both vnderstanding in this present lifeWisd. 3.9.; and the holy mountaine of GOD,
                  Esa. 57.13euen eternall life in the world to come. But this trust is not a naked expectation of somewhat to ensue, it resteth not onely vpon the verity of the promises of GOD, but vpon the interest that wee haue in them; and so it is accompanied with faith. For as Amber hath no smell of it selfe, but mingled with muske smelleth most sweetly; so trust of it selfe is altogether vnsauoury, but put faith to it, and nothing is either more pleasant or more assured. Who soeuer is well  acquainted with this trust, the more violent tempests beat vpon him, the more will he trust: Euen as the more strokes are set with a hammer vpon a naile, the more stiffely doeth it sticke. Albeit he were with Daniel in the Lions denne; albeit with Ionas in the VVhales belly; yet would hee trust. Of this trust the VVise man hath made a kinde of generall Proclamation in these words: Be it knowen to all nations and people, that no man euer trusted in GOD,
                  
                     Respicite filij, nationes hominum, & scitote, &c.
                   
                  and was confounded.
               
               O GOD! most faithfull in thy promise. O most

mercifull LORD! was neuer man hitherto confounded who trusted in thee? And shall I (most meeke GOD) be the first? It cannot bee. Peraduenture I am not so sorrowfull for my sinnes, as others haue bin; peraduenture I am not so assured in trust: yet my desire is to bee no lesse sorrowfull, no lesse assured then they. My will is good; I would faine bee an vnfained penitent. Blessed LORD! If neither my sorrow, nor my trust be so perfect as they should bee, thy goodnesse may easily either encrease them, or supplie their defect.
                     Humiliatu
                           •
                         sum & liberauit me.
                   And therefore most lowly I entreat thee, to sincke my soule more deepe into sorrow, that thereby I may more strongly rise into true trust: and then I shall not be confounded.
               
                   Now this trust must not bee grounded vpon any imaginarie or seeming power; not vpon riches, honour or anie other vanishing vanitie of the world; but vpon the word of GOD, which abideth for euer. All things vnder the Moone are like the Moone it selfe,Esa. 40. inconstant and changing euery day: yea, heauen and earth shall passe, but the word of the LORD shall neuer passe.
                  Luk. 20. And therefore O distressed soule! forsake not the veritie to follow vanitie. Trust not to the course comforts of the world, more bitter then the waters of Hiericho. Such bitter waters make barren land, the ground will neuer be fruitfull that is watered with them.

but this is repugnant to his nature, this he cannot doe. As he cannot die, as he cannot erre, so hee cannot  lye. But haply thou wilt say, that GOD is Omnipotent, and may doe whatsoeuer he will. It is true: GOD is Omnipotent: But I will tell thee what GOD cannot doe. GOD cannot lye, either by himselfe or by his messengers. If GOD could lye by himselfe, then were he not GOD: for GOD is trueth. Neither is he thereby the lesse Omnipotent: it i

                  impotencie and not Omnipotencie to lie. If hee could lye by his messengers, then some contrarietie might be espied in the holy Scriptures, which hitherto could not bee found. Assuredly, the word of the LORD is more immoueable then the poles of heauen, then the centre of the earth. Let the heauens be foulded together, let the earth dissipate into dust, let the nature of all things dissolue: the word of the LORD shall constantly remaine.
               O infallible! O vnresistable veritie! without either actiue or passiue deceit? O true GOD! O essentiall veritie! who canst no lesse cease to be true, then to bee: whose diuine wordes can neuer fall without effect. As they giue the wounde, so also the salue to cure it, bee it neuer so deadly. LORD thou hast promised remission of sinnes, if vnfainedly wee abhorre them: thou hast promised thy grace, if by griefe and sorrow we be truely disposed to receiue it. I haue thy word, and that is thy selfe.GOD is the word. Io. 1. I here arrest thy gracious word, and therewith thy selfe. I will neuer release this debt; I will neuer discharge thee without performance.
               
                  Wherefore, O redeemed soule! approach with trust to the throne of grace: approach without feare, albeit thou hast offended, albeit thy sinnes haue prouoked wrath. Hee hath obliged himselfe by his word; he hath made himselfe thy debter by his promise: neuer doubt but hee will truely discharge his credite; but he will faithfully performe, whatsoeuer  he hath mercifully promised. Trust in his word, hope in hi

                   mercie: but take this with thee. Vnlesse thou repent thy sinnes, vnlesse thou cleanse thy heart, vnlesse thou wash it with teares of contrition; thy trust will deceiue thee, thy hope will faile, thou shalt neuer attaine thy expected desire. In vaine doth he trust in the promise of GOD, who doth not repent and forsake his sinnes. The trust of an obstinate sinner, who pastureth in his sinnes, and thinkes to bee saued without repentance; is no true trust, but proud presumption.
               
                  Offer the sacrifice of righteousnesse, and put thy trust in the LORD.
                  Psa. 4. First offer the sacrifice of righteousnesse; which cannot bee done so long as thou continuest in sinne; and then put thy trust in the LORD. But what is this sacrifice of righteousnesse? It is thus described by the Apostle.Rom. 12. 
                  I beseech you brethren, that you giue vp your bodies a liuing sacrifice, holy acceptable vnto GOD: which is your reasonable seruing of GOD. Many persisting in sinne doe pray, fast, giue almes, and exercise other workes of deuotion. But those are dead offerings, they want the life of grace. These men preferre matters of deuotion, before those which perteine to obedience and band: a most dangerous and

frequent errour in religion. First, offer thy selfe a liuing sacrifice of righteousnesse, then mayest thou safely trust in the LORD. I will speake this plainely in a word: sacrifice thy will, and trust in the LORD. The will is a most inward facultie of the soule: a mistresse, a Queene. Whosoeuer offereth this, he offereth the best and highest thing in his kingdome. He sacrificeth his sonne Isaac; euen that which he most deerly loueth. This doth the Chaldee paraph
                     •
                  ase, in these words declare: Tame your concupiscences, and it shall be reputed to you as a sacrifice of righteousnesse. Doest thou trust in GOD? expectest thou saluation by him? Tame thy concupiscencies, and then thy trust is pure, and truely grounded: then feare nothing, hope then in the great mercies of GOD: this trust will then procure thee present grace and glory in the end. Otherwise, thou hast no true ground of thy trust; otherwise thy trust is a dangerous security: euen as Iob sayth: The hope of the wicked is an abhomination of the soule.
                  Iob. 11
               
               O GOD! faithfull in thy promise, and fearefull  in thy reuenge; My soule fixeth the eyes of her faith vpon thy word, neuer so soone spoken, as sure to bee performed. Howsoeuer externall matters fall, I will neuer bee pulled from assurance in thy word: my soule shall alwayes confidently expect performance of thy promise: albeit thou seemest slow; albeit thou seemest altogether to abandon me. The mountaines of my misdeedes haue tumbled vpon mee, drawing after them thy importable wrath; which is also followed with many sad afflictions. I groane vnder my

sinnes, I pant and tremble vnder thy wrath; helpe LORD with thy powerfull hand, for I am vnable to stand vnder this heauie charge. But touching my afflictions, according to the measure of stripes which storme vpon my backe, I will looke backe alwayes to thee, and say;
               O most mercifull, most Iust GOD! in whom mercie  and Iustice is one! I humbly bow, I prostrate my selfe wholly to thy holy will. But equall my forces to my afflictions; giue me patience, proportionable to my paynes; as my troubles encrease, encrease therewith also my courage and my trust. Gentle LORD! I quietly endure thy heauie hand, I patiently expect thy fauourable forbearance: I expect vntill, like an expert Phisition, thou shalt wholly remoue the cause, that is, my sinnes and thy wrath; and then the effects, which are my miseries, will suddenly vanish. I call to my consideration thy word, I fixe thy promises both liberall and sweet before the eye of my vnderstanding. This is the proppe whereto I leane, this is the pillar whereon I stand; by this all the forces of my soule are sustained. All the forces of my soule embrace thy word, euen as the iuie embraceth a tree, by fastning rootes into the body thereof. From hence I will assuredly expect, to bee released from all these euils. I haue no trust but in thy goodnesse and trueth. So long as this anchore holdeth, I shall bee safe from shipwracke, in all the tempests of temptations in this life.
               All the reasons which bind mee to loue thee, compell mee also to trust in thee. For in whom should I

trust, but in him, who so loued mee? in him who hath heaped so manie benefits vpon mee? in him who hath suffered so grieuously for mee? In him who hath so often called, so long expected, so carefully perswaded mee? In him who is so mercifull, pitifull, louing, gentle, patient, and ready to forgiue,? In him who is a Father, an Almighty Father? A Father to loue mee, Almighty to helpe mee? A Father that hee will, Almighty that hee can doe good vnto mee? A Father that hath greater care and prouidence ouer his spirituall children, then any Father can haue ouer his carnall? Lastly, in whom should I trust but in him, who hath commanded me to approch to him, to trust in him? And hath promised mee many fauoures and rewardes, if I will so doe?
            
            
               
               
                  
                     VERS. VI.
                     My soule flieth to the LORD before the morning watch, I say before the morning watch.
                  
               
               
                  
                     1 TWO lights of our vnderstanding.
                     
                     2 Our weakenesse not so great as wee pretend.
                     
                     3 Our owne indeuour must be added to the working of the LORD, and that in two points.
                     
                     4 In swiftnesse.
                     
                     5 In timelinesse.
                     
                     6 We are not perfect at the first, and wherefore.
                     
                     7 A prayer.
                     
                     8 Wherefore we are to resort to GOD.
                     
                     9 Ioy answereth desire, as rest answereth motion.
                     
                     10 In afflictions we must especially addresse our selues to GOD, and wherefore.
                     
                     11 Also whensoeuer we sinne, and wherefore.
                     
                     
                        12 How dangerous it is to perseuere in sinne.
                     
                     13 Examples and reasons proouing the same.
                     
                     14 A sinner vpon hope is little better then a sinner vpon despaire.
                     
                     15 Times not well imployed are often shortned.
                     
                     16 Deferring of repentance will hearden our hearts.
                     
                     17 How GOD may answer late repenting sinners.
                     
                     18 How fearefull it is to trust to late repentance.
                     
                     19 It is a long walke to happinesse, and by many steppes.
                     
                     20 The cause of the fall of Angels.
                     
                     21 We finde rest onely in GOD, and wherefore.
                     
                  
               
               
                  BVT do not so looke for the LORD, O my soule, that thou remaine without motion in thy selfe; stand not looking like a sencelesse statue, but applie the forces wherewith GOD hath originally endowed thee: for hee that made thee without thy selfe, without thy selfe will not saue thee. Thou hast two lights, two eies of thy vnderstanding, faith and reason. Faith is wrought in thee by his word; reason is naturally planted in thee: as he worketh extraordinarily by his word, so nature is his ordinary power. But nothing is more comfortable & contenting, then when both concur & agree together. Thou doest often complaine of weakenesse: but examine thy selfe well, and thou shalt not finde so great cause to complaine of thy weakenesse, as of thy will; thy

weakenesse will not appeare so great, if thy endeuour be an
                     •
                  werable to thy power.
               
                   And therefore, O my soule, as thou lookest for the LORD, so looke that thou adde thy owne endeuour. Especially looke that thou bee diligent, and that in two points: in swiftnesse, Flie to the LORD: and in  timelinesse, before the morning watch. It was commanded in the Law that the Paschall Lambe should bee eaten in haste. Whereby is signified, with what feruour of spirit, with what hungry hast, wee must applie our desires to our heauenly repast: otherwise it will neuer either fill or content vs. Doe not linger lazily as Lot did in Sodome: bee not slow paced to forsake the world; which is no better then a denne of theeues, a stable of beasts, a puddle with swine, a dunghill with snakes; yea, a part of Hell: bee not heauie and dull to resort to GOD. Breake off all  dangerous delayes, whereby the Diuell endeuoureth to deuoure all thy time: but as a Doue hasteth her flight from the pursuit of an Eagle; so earely and in good time begin to take wing, and dispatch thy selfe from the world, to flie to the LORD. Bee not taken sleeping, as was the slothfull seruant; but addresse thy selfe to the LORD. As GOD doth helpe right earely, so right earely seeke for his helpe: euen before the morning watch:
                  Psa. 46.5. 
                  I say before the morning watch.
               
               All effects conuert to their cause, to receiue from thence their last perfections. The chicken so soone as it creepeth foorth of the shell, will resort vnder the wings of the hen. The Lambe so soon as it is brought

foorth, will apply it selfe to the teats of the damme; it will know her, it will follow her among all the flocke. But tell me, reasonable man; what reason hast thou not to doe that, which thou seest vnreasonable beasts performe? Thou art not perfect; thou  wantest many things. This doth the restlesse appetite of thy nature conuince; alwaies desiring somewhat, and neuer fully content. GOD would not make thee perfect at the first: not because he was sparing, but because he knew it fittest for thy good; not as denying, but as suspending his plentie; not to make thee poore, but humble; not because thou shouldest alwaies want, but because thou shouldest alwaies depend vpon him. LORD, thy workes are  perfect, and I am the worke of thy handes: I am fearefully and wonderfully, but not perfectly made. Thy hands haue made me and fashioned me: but stay not here, gracious LORD,Psal. 119. proceede still to perfect thy worke; O giue me vnderstanding, that I may learne thy commandements. I was created vnperfect, like a blind whelpe; but open thou the eyes of my soule, and therewith infuse thy light; that I may discerne my defects, and resort to thee daily, to adde something toward perfecting thy worke. For of whom should I desire that which I want, but of him who hath giuen me that which I haue? There is no doubt, but he who hath giuen the beginning, will also knit vp and finish the end.
               LORD, If thou beest my beginning and my end, whom else should I desire? If all the good which I either haue or expect floweth from thy most liberall

hand, vpon whom else should I depend? if thou beest my Father, my king, my Lord, my creator, my preseruer, my gouernour, my redeemer; if I dailie receiue, not my preseruation onely, but some part of perfection from thee; to whom else should I hastily flie? Seruants follow their masters for a small reward; and wherefore am not I diligent and readie both to serue and obserue thee, who hast deserued so much, and reserued farre greater matters for me? O my LORD! since I haue so iust causes and reasons, to resort vnto thee, wherefore is not my soule and all the abilities thereof enflamed with desire of thee? wherefore doe I not take the wings of the morning and flie vnto thee? O my hope! my glory! my delight! O my beginning! my perfection! my end! O my GOD! when shall I truely long after thee? when shall I hasten to approach thee? when shall I finde all impediments remooued which hold me from thee? when shall I find all that dead in me, which is not delightfull to thee? when will the houre come, wherein nothing shall liue in me but thy selfe? when wilt thou violently rauish me? When inebriate me with desire of thee? when shall I be whollie thine? when wilt thou transforme mee wholly into thee? when shall I see the day, wherein I shall be one spirit with thee, and neuer after be deuided from thee?
               I beseech thee, O my GOD! giue me wherwith to pay that which I owe thee; that albeit I cannot thus enioy thee, yet with all my heart I desire thee, and with all my endeauours aspire vnto thee: because, as in no other thing there is perfect ioy,

so our desires and endeauours should aime at nothing else. For ioy answereth desire, as rest answereth motion;  as rest is when motion ceaseth, so then is ioy when nothing is desired. But because in matters of this world desire hath no perfect rest,

                           ••
                        abor cum apparueris gloria tuae. Ps. 16. it followeth, that it hath in them no perfect ioy: but as thou only fillest our desires, so in thee onely is perfect ioy. And therefore grant to my soule, I humbly intreat thee, such large proportion of ioy in thee, that my ioy may enflame my desire to be with thee, and my desire may draw my endeauours to flie vnto thee. That my ioy in thee may be such, that I propound nothing interially to my desires, nothing exterially to my endeauoures, but onely to enioy thee.
               Especiallie, O my soule, when thou art whipped  with any affliction, addresse thy selfe foorthwih to the LORD. So soone as thou feelest his stripes on thy backe, make no stay, (for this may procure thee a dreadfull, if not a deadly blow) but presently start vp and flie vnto him. For assuredlie, at these times he worketh vpon thee, to aduance thee towards thy perfection; at these times he contriueth thee to some speciall end for himselfe.1. Pet. 2.5 The godlie are termed liuely stones for a spirituall building, but a stone must bee squared and hewen, and by many sad strokes made fit, or else will not serue for a beautifull building. No doubt is made of the saluation of Dauid, who liued alwayes vnder the rode; but of the saluation of Solomon, who liued alwaies in prosperity and peace, much question is made. For doubtlesse as it is more dangerous sailing in fresh waters then in salt,

so a prosperous life is more obnoxious to perils, then a life trauersed with many troubles. The more the people of Israel were oppressed, the more they encreased: the more the waters of the deluge swelled, the neerer was the Arke eleuated towards heauen: and calamities of this life are not only sure signes of the fauour of GOD, but meanes also to procure the same.

Ps. 117 For they stirre men to resort to GOD, and neuer to giue ouer their swift pursuite, vntill the dawning of diuine comforts open vpon them; aswell to dispell the thicke damps and mists of their miseries, as both to enlighten and refresh their soules, ouerclouded with heauinesse, and to erect them by hope to secure quiet and ioy.
               
                   Also whensoeuer thou fallest into any sin, do not lie still, either pleasuring or sleeping therein, but early arise and flie to the LORD: haste thee presentlie; rather cut the knot, then stay to vntie it. Seeke the LORD whilest he may be found,
                  Es. 55.6. 
                  call vpon him whilest he is neere. But when is he more neere then at the present Novv? When may he more easily be found? when better called vpon, then at the very Novv euen Novv when he calleth to thee. Now is the acceptable time, Now is the day of Saluation.
                  2. Cor. 6.2.
               
               All agree, that after sinne there is no hope of felicitie; no hope of eternall life but by repentance. Herein all are agreed, but wherein then lieth the difference? Not in the summe of the debt, but in the dayes of payment. All agree that repentance is due; but most perswade themselues that the payment may be made at leasure. But assuredly there is no

time so fit as the present. For what stupendious  stupiditie is it, to deferre the most weightie worke of repentance to a future time? whereby, besides that the time may bee taken from thee, thou shalt daily growe more vnfit to repent. For by reason of long continuance and frequencie of acts, custome will grow strong and inuincible; whereby, nature is corrupted, grace estranged, and the power and tyrannie of the Diuell much confirmed.
               Obserue hereof a familiar example. If a childe  be brought from a distant country, he will perfectly pronounce our language in a very short time: If hee be a man of yeeres, hee will hardly or neuer rightly pronounce it. What is the cause? confirmed custome, which can hardly be broken: we are hardly drawen either to forget or forsake that, whereto of long time we haue bin enured. And assuredly, change of life is no lesse vneasy then change of language: and therefore repentance must needs bee so much the harder, by how much it is later. Oh! how many would gladly forsake their wicked liues? but being fast locked and chained in the prison of euill custome, they are not able to breake from themselues.
               He who hath a great estate may well endure some wast expence: but he who oweth more then hee is worth, had neede be a good husband of that which he hath. Thou art not well assured to liue one houre, and darest thou make to thy selfe a prodigall promise of manie yeeres?

                  he destruction of many: a sinner vpon such hope is little better then a sinner vpon despaire: for both sinne

                   alike vpon different reasons. The desperate sinneth because he thinketh hee must bee damned; the presumptuous because he hopeth he may at pleasure repent: he sinneth, because he despaireth; this hopeth because he will sinne. Woe to this hope, woe to that presumption; both are fearefull and dangerous alike. GOD hath promised pardon to repentance; but he hath not promised either time, or abilitie, or mind to repent. Hee hath alreadie giuen thee a faire time to repent: but he hath put times and seasons in his owne power;Act. 1.7. and will assuredly shorten them if they  be not well imployed. For so in the dayes of Noah he gaue 120. yeeres for man to repent; which because they did abuse, he strooke off 20 yeeres, and raised the deluge in the hundreth yeere.
               Thou art carefull to cure the least hurts of thy bodie forthwith: and wilt thou neglect or deferre to remedie the mortall and immortall woundes of thy soule? When euery day thy miserable soule is hewen, burnt, poisoned, precipitated, torne in pieces; when euery day it perisheth a thousand wayes; wilt thou be nothing sensible thereof?Exod. 8.10. wilt thou be like Pharao, who when all Aegypt, as wel in the fields, as in the houses, swarmed with frogges, yet would haue prayer deferred vntill to morrow.

If the world calleth thee aside, to riches, honour, pleasures, or any other of her entising harlotries, tell her thou canst not come; thou hast a great important busines in hand, and but a small time to performe it: thou hast neither leisure nor lust to listen to her.
               When Ioab had defeated Abner,
                  2. Sam. 2. and chased his armie with a long execution, Abner cried to him; Shall the sword deuoure for euer? to whom Ioab answered: As GOD liueth, if thou hadst spoken in the morning, the people had gone away, euery one from following his brother. The like may GOD answer to sinners, who  all the day of their life beare armes against him, and at the night of their death desire to bee at peace. As I liue, if you had spoke to mee in the morning, if in seasonable time you had desired mercy, I would haue spared you: but now execution is in the heate, you come somwhat late: you must neuer stand to the courtesie of iustice, you come now vpon ineuitable necessitie, vpon base seruile feare, which neuer iustifieth. Your repentance now is not frō the heart. You are now like merchants, who when their ship is in danger, throw their riches ouerboard; but when the tempest is ouer, search euery shoare to find them againe. Your apprehension of present danger hath perswaded you against your wils to disgorge your

consciences, and cast vp your pleasures: but if the feare blow ouer, if you recouer your former estate, you will foorthwith returne to your former life.
               Thus may GOD say, and thus for the most part it happeneth. We neuer examine our great accompt, wee neuer addresse our selues to bee at peace with GOD, so long as we haue one vanitie vnspent. But when time hath beaten from vs both youth, pleasure and health; when it hath made vs both insociable to others, and burthensome to our selues; when our attendants are variable sickenesses and paines; when the soule loathes her ruinous and excrementall lodging: then looking into our consciences, which pleasure and sloth had locked before, we behold therein the fearefull images of our actions past, and withall this terrible sentence engrauen: that, GOD will bring  euery worke to iudgement.
                  Eccl. 12.14. But how dare wee trust to our repentance at that time, when the will by long custome is stiffe, and almost inflexible; when the vnderstanding partly weakened, partly amazed, is vnable to behold diuers obiects perfectly. Assuredly, to neglect GOD, to offend him willingly, casting our hopes on the peace which wee trust to make at our parting, is a high presumption, or (which is worse) a scornefull con

               Of all things that can be desired, eternall felicity is the chiefe. No man but doeth naturally desire it. No man with deliberate reason would lose it for the empire of all the world; no merchant is so foolish, who would exchange the hope thereof, for any aduantage that can be set foorth: no man vpon any

condition would bee quite cast out of that hope. Now the ordinary way which GOD hath appointed to attaine felicitie, is a long and laboursome walke, a great iourney, from vertue to vertue, from strength to strength, vntill wee appeare before GOD in Sion. This was figured by the ladder which Iacob saw in a vision; extending from earth to heauen, and consisting (doubtlesse) of many steppes. Signifying, that no man can attaine that happy height, no man can approch him who standeth at the toppe, but by many degrees of vertues, whereof euery one also hath many steppes. Consider with mee but a few of these, and namely the mortifying of all affections, either vicious or impertinent and vaine: then the treading in all the steps of humility, patience, meekenesse, mercifulnesse, temperance, obedience, feare, fortitude, true discretion, pure intention, sobrietie, modesty, externall composition, sweetnesse to others, seueritie against our selues, and all other vertues required; and verely thou shalt finde it a long ladder indeede, and that which will require a long time to climbe. This climbing or walking is otherwise termed an edification or building. For as a great building cannot be mowlded vp in an instant; but first the foundation must bee layde, then the walles erected, and lastly the roofe and floores framed: so in this spirituall building, a sure foundation must bee layd vpon earth, if we intend to raise it to reach into heauen.
               And therefore it is a point of extreame either blindnesse or madnesse, to aime at this end, this happie

end, this last end, and not to obserue the meanes appointed to attaine it. This is thought to bee the cause of the fall of Angels;

                   euen because they aspired to their highest end, without due obseruing the meanes. For as sparkes strooke from a flint, if they flie vpward, they extinguish; but if they bee caried downeward, they take fire and burne: so those Angels which humbled themselues and embraced the meanes, attained to glory; but they who proudly presumed by their owne abilities suddenly to attaine it, not onely failed thereof, but were deiected into hell. In like maner wee all desire happinesse, there is not any who would not bee happie: but wee regard not the meanes appointed for that end. Wee will not worke, wee will not walke; wee will not addresse our forces to the workes, nor our feete to the waies which bring to happinesse. We will not take either time or paines; but thinke to mount to heauen, at a leape, at a iumpe; at the last time of our age, at the last minute of our life; by a few short wishes rather then prayers. But blessed is the man (O LORD) whose strength is in thee, in whose heart are thy wayes. They shall goe from strength to strength, and vnto the GOD of gods appeareth euery one of them in Sion.
               
               Wherefore, O my soule! howsoeuer others either linger or giue ouer; betake thou thy selfe speedily to the LORD. For to whom else shouldest thou resort? he is thy prefection, thy last end, the rest and satisfaction of all thy desires. Thou doest naturally desire nothing but him; the desire of worldly things is but a disease. Goe too then, tumble vpon

the bed of honour, riches, or pleasure; thou shalt neuer find rest,GOD formed man, and breathed into him the breath of life. because thou cariest thy disease within thee: ridde thee of thy sickenesse, and thou shalt finde rest onely in GOD. The reason is plaine. GOD made thee only for himselfe; and therefore being thy last end, thou canst not find quiet, but onely in him. Againe, GOD onely is agreeable to thy nature:Gen. 2.7. thou art his image, thou art breathed from him. No worldly thing hath any proportion with thy nature, and therefore can not giue thee true satisfaction. A horse is not satisfied with flesh, nor a Lion with grasse; because such foode agreeth not with the nature of those beasts. No lesse can a spirit be satisfied with corporall things, because they are not conformable thereto. The gifts and graces of GOD are conformable to thy nature, they only giue thee both nourishment and delight. Pride and enuy are spirituall things; but they no more nourish a soule, then poison nourisheth a body. God only is agreeable to thy Nature, GOD onely filleth thy desire. And yet neither by filling thy desire hee doeth extinguish it; neither by enflaming thy desire he ceaseth to fill it. Wherefore (O my soule) Loose not time, but since he hath created thee: Remember thy maker in the dayes of thy youth. Since thou hast no satisfaction but from him, take the wings of the morning, and flie vnto him.

                  O Heauenly hope! there is no labour, no calamitie, albeit daily storming, daily encreasing, but by thee is made tolerable? Without thee, many would faint and fall vnder their heauie burthens: but thou suppliest, not only strength to endure, but courage to beare ouer all extremitie. This was figured by the windowe in Noahs Arke, which was made aboue towards heauen; signifying, that in that cruell calamitie, reliefe was to bee expected onely from thence. Death triumpheth ouer all earthly things, but thou triumphest ouer death; thou art more victorious then death. And therefore albeit Iacob was dying, yet his hope died not when he said:
                     Expectabo tuum salutar
                           •
                         domine
                   
                  I will looke for thy saluation, O LORD. Here hence holy Iob also in his greatest extremities said:
                     Gen. 40. Iob 19.25 26. 
                  I know that my Redeemer liueth: and though wormes destroy this body,

yet in my flesh I shall see GOD. Wherfore, O my soule! doe not onely flie to the LORD vpon the wings of thy hope, doe not thou onely rest assured vpon confidence in his worde, but perswade all others to do the like.
               O my friendes, O all ye of the house and Church of GOD! Trust in the LORD. Attend for succours only from him: for he is both ready and most assured. Albeit your distresse bee great and fearefull; albeit you be not presently heard, albeit you seeme to bee forsaken, yet trust in the LORD. Against all hope, hope in him: euen when your case seemeth desperate and forlorne, euen vnto death stand steadie as a rocke,  and trust in the LORD. It is a familiar fashion with our LORD, to suffer his friends and faithfull seruants to sweat vnder the sad burthens of aduersities, and to seeme as if he neither heard their prayers, nor regarded their griefes. And this he doth only to exercise them; that their faith, patience, constancie, and other vertues may more gloriously appeare: for that which the file is to yron, and fire to gold; the same is trouble to the friends of GOD. Hee loadeth them with labours, because thereby ariseth their reward; which in no case he will suffer them to loose.
               If GOD hath not hitherto thus dealt with some, it is because hee knoweth their weakenesse, hee knoweth their cowardice, hee knoweth how vnfitte they are to bee his souldiers; hee will not take them into his pay. they who neuer tasted troubles, haue great cause to feare, that they are vnder no fauourable hand. For it is a propertie of the diuell to blinde men

by liuing in prosperity, as men are blinded by walking in the snowe. Hee leadeth his seruants like a hangman, by the broad and faire way of false pleasures and comforts, to the place of their execution: he mounteth them vpon high scaffolds, to the end to dispatch them with the greater griefe and shame. So was the rich man aduanced, when hee boasted of his wealth: but the same night he lost both his riches and his soule. When the deuill most flattereth, then hee hunteth; then you are most in danger of his snares.
               And therefore (O my friends) In all your troubles trust in the LORD; for this is one of the principall conditions of obtaining your desires. So soone as hee heareth the faithfull crie of his faithfull seruants, so soone as he perceiueth their true intention; so soone shall they finde their deliuerance at hand. Turne not from the LORD to put your trust in Princes, or in the sonnes of men. And good cause why?Ps. 146. 
                  For when the breath of man goeth foorth, all his thoughts perish. Oh! that wee could discerne the secret thoughts of diuers princes, what stately towers they build in the wind; what walles, what pallaces they frame, as it were by art of Incantation. Such kingdomes they will ouercome; such cities they will beat downe; such spoyles their souldiers shall haue; such treasures shall rise to themselues: all which is puffed away with a breath. Euen as when Pharaoh sayd: I will pursue, I will ouertake, 
                  Exod. 15. 
                  I will diuide the spoyle, I will draw my sword, my hand shall consume them: the winde blew, and the sea couered them.
               
               Trustnot also in worldly things, of which the wise mā saith; that they passe away like a shadow. A shadow is

the counterfeit of a body, it representeth a body in euery point. It seemeth to haue head, armes, legges; to moue, to rest: when in very truth it is nothing. So all matters of the world are full of deceit. They are somwhat in appearance, but in trueth nothing: nothing in the world but a meere aperie. They are presented to our eyes, but they do not continue: they are caried as a shippe vnder sayle, which hath not one moment of rest: as the world turneth round, so are all who trust in it, turned as in a wheele. This raiseth in them a spirit of giddinesse or error,
                  Es. 10.14 which tosseth them forward, and backward, and turning, as a man rapt with a whirlewind; or as a drunken man in a daunce. It is a proper name of GOD, to be: He that is (saith Moses) hath sent mee: but nothing is more strange to worldly things then to bee.
                  Exod. 3. And therefore Cursed is hee that trusteth in man,
                  Hier. 17. or any worldly meanes. But, Blessed is hee who trusteth in the LORD.
                  Ps. 84. & 146.
               
               Neuer conceiue that you cannot trust in him, because you are sinners, because you are obnoxious to many infirmities, because you haue not performed obedience to him: Verely, you are most vnworthy to bee regarded of GOD, when you most respect your owne worthinesse and merits. What? would you ground your trust vpon such a false foundation? Nay, it must haue a more firme footing then so. It must rest vpon two steadie stayes. One is, the goodnesse and mercy of GOD: the Other is, the plentifull merittes of our redemption. These are the immoueable pillars whereon our trust must bee grounded. For with thee there is mercie, and plenteous redemption.
                  
And therefore bee not dismayed at your owne vnworthinesse, but direct your thoughts to his vnmeasurable mercies, & to his plentifull redemption; and therein aduance your hope to him and say; wee haue sinned and done wickedly,
                  Dan. 9. 
                  wee haue rebelled and departed from thy Iudgements. O LORD, Righteousnesse belongeth to thee, and vnto vs open shame. O LORD, vnto vs pertaineth open shame, because we haue sinned against thee: yet compassion and forgiuenesse is with thee, O LORD our GOD; albeit wee haue rebelled against thee.
               
               If you will settle a true iudgement vpon his mercie, you may make the estimate by the immensitie of his diuine substance: For, as his greatnesse is,
                  Eccl. 2.21 
                  so is his mercie. And therefore as hee is infinitely great, so is hee infinitely mercifull: and as hee hath infinite riches to bee distributed, so is hee infinitely liberall to distribute the same. Otherwise there shall bee a defect and disproportion in the diuine substance; If hauing infinite goods to bee distributed, hee should not haue an infinite mind and will for distribution. This great mercie of GOD was not vnknowen to the idolatrous Philistims;1. Chr. 6.3 who vpon presenting their offerings to him, assured themselues that they should be healed. O the bowels of his mercie! hee so loueth his creatures, that it grieueth him to see them perish: scarce doe his eyes behold their miseries, but he is forthwith mooued to mercy. LORD, they who know thy Name will trust in thee: for thou hast neuer failed them who seeke thee. Psal. 9.10.
               There are two perfections in GOD, Mercy and

Iustice, both cut by the same measure and compasse: neyther canne bee greater nor lesse then the other, because both are infinite. Yet in two points they differ; in two points mercie is preferred before Iustice.  First because GOD by his own nature is more inclinable to mercy.
                     Indignatio non est mihi. Es. 27.4. For his essentiall goodnesse leadeth him to mercy: but hee proceedeth not to vengeance vnlesse hee bee prouoked by our sinnes. And therefore when hee scourged sinners out of the temple, he brought no whippe with him, but made it of cords which hee found amongst them: he taketh both the cause and the matter of the scourge onely from our selues. The second is because hee offereth his mercie generally to all: but his punitiue Iustice remaineth onely for those who contemne his mercy. All they who embrace his mercy, shall neuer tast the smart of his iustice.
               
                   Againe, albeit all the diuine perfections are not onely equall, but one in GOD; yet hee is most rich in the workes of mercie, and hath done greater things to demonstrate his goodnesse and mercie, then his other vertues and perfections besides. To manifest his wisedome and power, hee created the world; to declare his iustice, hee drowned it: but to shew his mercie, hee died for it. Oh! how inestimable greater is the worke, that GOD suffered for the world, then that hee created it? that GOD died for man, then that all men should haue perished.Exod. 34.6 
                  O! the LORD, the LORD; strong, mercifull and gracious; slow to anger, and abundant in goodnesse and trueth: reseruing mercie for thousands, and forgiuing iniquitie and sinne.
               
               
                  And therfore (O distressed men!) whensoeuer you approach to GOD for mercie, neuer distrust: neuer think your importunitie displeasing, or the opportunitie not fit. Neuer think that you offer him a matter, which eyther hee will bee vnwilling, or hath beene vnaccustomed to doe; but rather that you present him with occasion of acquiring praise, and to doe that which is most agreeable, both to his glory and to his nature. It is his nature and propertie to haue mercy.
                   Not that other perfections are not also proper to him: but this hee hath in greatest estimation, for this especially hee will bee praysed. Assuredly if his mercie were not infinite, if it were little and limited, which might receiue diminution or increase, then were something imperfect in GOD: but nothing in him canne bee imperfect; therefore his mercy is infinite, without eyther measure or end. Goe vnto him, any person, at any time, you shall alwayes finde that with him is mercy:
               The fountaine of his mercy and grace which springeth from his fatherly heart, can neuer be either stopped or spent: the waters thereof are of singular vertue, not only to cleanse the filthinesse of sinne, but to enrich soules with heauenly beauty. Neuer feare  that you cannot bee refreshed with these streames. I will tell you what you shall doe, and you neede not feare. Detest your sinnes and trust in the LORD, and his mercies will ouerflow, hee will bee infinitely succourable to you. His goodnesse will wipe away all sorrow that you haue beene

                  ners, and make you reioyce that euer you fell: as hauing made triall that

as your offences surmount all measure, so his mercies and grace exceed your offences: yea, it is not possible that GOD should denie his mercy to penitent sinners, who trust in him; for then he should not make good his word, then he should denie himselfe, which is not possible for him to doe. But if they trust without repentance, they doe not then trust, but presume.
               
                   But as I haue tolde you (O yee seruants of the LORD) repent your sinnes and trust in him: and then perswade your selues that with GOD is no anger: nothing but mercy and loue: because he cannot but loue those who beleeue in him. And therefore if any calamity fall vpon you, it is in mercy; endure it patiently, and hope to bee deliuered when GOD shall thinke fit. If you haue committed any sinne, yet, with GOD is mercy; trust to this mercy, and you shall neuer be indamaged by your sinnes. Albeit to your sence hee appeareth to bee angrie, regard not your sence, but stedfastly beleeue, that in heauen and vpon earth, there is nothing but mercy: if you should die for it, neuer suffer this trust to be wrested from you. Beleeue not your sence, but beleeue the word which hath sayd, that with the LORD is mercy, for those who trust in him. Write this promise in your heart; that if you truly trust in his mercy, you shall not perish, albeit all sence, reason and experience should perswade the contrary. In your selues you shall find nothing but wrath, in the Diuell nothing but malice, in the world nothing

LORD, thou hast made vs of nothing, we are feeble flesh. VVe daily sinne, we dayly aske pardon. Shall we now be despised, and neuer any despised before? Our sinnes indeed are great; but thy mercies exceed all greatnesse and measure. Our sinnes are many: but there is no number of thy mercies. Our sinnes after forgiuenesse are many times renued: but thy mercies are not limited either to number or time. For with the LORD IS mercy. At all times mercy; nothing but mercy; mercy neuer either exhausted or with held.
               The second foundation of your trust must be vpon the merits of our Redeemer. For with GOD there is not onely mercy, but plenteous redemption. The plenty  and riches of this redemption is the innocent and precious bloud of IESVS CHRIST: which as it maketh a treasure of innumerable riches, so can wee not doubt, either of his power or of his will to distribute the same: His power dependeth vpon his will; and his will is guided by his loue, wherewith he offered his

bloud for our redemption. This loue enforceth his will; and his will is alwayes followed by his power. So as being largely assured of his loue, wee must nothing doubt, either of his will, or of his power. And the better to assure vs heereof, hee was not sparing, but rather seemed prodigall, in expence of his most blessed bloud. Physitions prescribe bleeding in a moderate measure; but our redeemer out of his vnmeasurable loue made a profuse effusion of all that hee had. One drop of his bloud in regard of the inestimable value thereof, might haue sufficed for redeeming many worlds: but to make our redemption plentifull, hee did not reserue one drop to himselfe. His bloud, his precious bloud, euery drop of his precious bloud, was poured foorth for our redemption. After that his externall parts were emptied of bloud, by sweating, scourging, crowning and nailing: His internall and vitall parts were also drayned by the stroke of a speare. For in that water flowed foorth, without any tincture of bloud, it was an euident proofe that all the bloud was spent. A little bloud will giue colour to much water: and therefore if any little bloud had remayned, the water must haue been somewhat coloured thereby.
               
                   This is the treasure, this the ransome wherewith sinners are redeemed. This most precious bloud was shed without measure: to the end, that be our sinnes neuer so grieuous, so many, so often repeated, wee should heere finde a plenteous redemption: whensoeuer with penitent mindes we craue benefit therof. VVho will despaire? who can doubt of his deliuerance?

VVhen GOD of his owne will hath so plentifully redeemed vs. VVho can suspect that he will be lesse willing to distribute this treasure, then hee was to amasse it? Assuredly there is no default in  GOD if sinners be damned, for hee desireth not the death of a sinner: there is no default in GOD for not giuing, but there may bee default in sinners, for not desiring. GOD desireth that his mercy bee magnified aboue his iustice; but sinners desire rather to prouoke his iustice, then to inuoke his mercy.
               By this redemption wee are not onely deliuered  both from the guilt, and eternall punishment of our sinnes; but wee are also enriched with the righteousnesse of our Redeemer. All the merits of his penury, trauailes, watchings, groanings, sweat, teares, and bloud, are our rich treasure. All his innocence and righteousnesse is ours. For the righteousnesse of the second Adam is no lesse ours, then was the transgression of the first Adam: wee no lesse participate of the innocencie and sanctity of the one, for our saluation, then of the disobedience of the other for our damnation. And therefore as Iacob being apparelled with the garments of his elder brother Esau, procured a blessing which by right of birth was not his due; so if wee bee clothed with the righteousnesse of our Redeemer, wee shall obtaine a blessing, whereto wee can otherwise pretend no right. In offering this sacrifice, and in presenting these merits, what can we feare? GOD is our Redeemer: it is GOD who iustifieth, who can condemne?
                  Rom. 8.31. & 33. GOD is our patron and Aduocate: If GOD bee on our side who can bee against vs?
                  
This is he to whom all the Prophets witnesse:
                     Act. 10. 
                  That through his name all that beleeue in him should receiue remission of sinnes.
                  Destroy this Temple, &c. Iohn 2.19. Their sacrifices I wil accept vpon my Altar. This is the true liuing Temple of GOD; of whom the Temple of Salomon was but a figure. This is the Altar, whereon all the prayers which we offer to GOD are acceptable to him. This is our only Priest, our only Sacrifice, our only Temple, our only Altar whereby we are made acceptable to GOD.
               
                   I will make this which I haue said a little more familiar by an example. Albeit a man hath deserued nothing of his Prince whereby he may claime either respect or reward; yet if his father haue performed great seruices, If he hath spent his trauailes, his estate, his life in his Princes employment; the sonne may no lesse both boldly and iustly sue for reward,  then if in his owne person he had deserued it. Our case is not vnlike; for all who are in the state of grace, are the adoptiue sonnes of IESVS CHRIST, hee is their Father, their second Adam; they are his sonnes,
                     Filius? ergo Heres.
                   and consequently his lawfull heires. Not as if hee had died intestate; but by his last will and testament, which hee made the euening before his death, at his last supper, and soone after confirmed it with his blood.
                     Hic est sanguis meus qui pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum. Matth. 26. By this testament he gaue vs his bloud: and thereby hath made vs heires of all the merits for shedding his bloud. Hereby wee haue good right to demand the reward due to all his labors,  and to the losse of his bloud, and that with full assurance; not only in regard of mercy, which drew him so liberally to lay foorth his bloud; but also of

Iustice, which thereby is largely satisfied. For whatsoeuer he either did or endured in this world, all the sharpe stony steps which he trode, was in no part for himselfe, but altogether for vs. For vs he was incarnate and borne; for vs he sustained many contemptible both indignities and wants; for vs hee fasted, watched and prayed; for vs hee did groane, weepe and bleed: Lastly, for vs he died,
                     Consummatum est. 10.19.30. which was the accomplishment of our redemption. Of all this he hath made vs heires in his last will and testament; and that by his free goodnesse and grace. For he was innocent, and needed not to discharge any thing for himselfe: neither had hee any neede of vs, to encrease by that meanes either his greatnesse or his glory.

                  COme with me then, and I will carrie you to the toppe of a high watch-tower, where you may behold marueilous things. Here with great humilitie & reuerence of your soules lift vp your eyes aboue the clouds, and aboue all the heauens, surmount all the companies of Cherubin and Seraphin, and aduance to the highest throne of Maiestie. There fasten your thoughts vpon the most pure diuine substance, which

there keepeth state: that beautifull light, that vnapproachable light, which no mortall eye did euer behold. That glorious LORD, in whom are the beauties and perfections of all creatures, in farre greater excellencie then in themselues: Him who with the bare inclination of his will created all things: Him whose bright Maiestie as we are vnable to behold, so without the light thereof we are blind: Him whose wisedome, power, beauty, Maiestie, greatnesse, cannot bee expressed, cannot be comprehended. Who remaining vnmoueable giueth motion to all things; who gouerneth all things, yet applieth himselfe to nothing; who vseth all things, and needeth nothing; who changeth his workes, and yet remaineth constant in his counsailes: whom all the starres, all the Saints and Angels praise and adore. At whose presence the pillars of heauen tremble,
                     Quis appendit iti bus digitis molem terra? Es. 40. who poiseth the whole masse of the earth with three fingers; and in whose sight all nations are as if they were not. Him whose happinesse is such, that it cannot be either encreased or diminished: Insomuch as his glory will be nothing the more, if all men should be saued and praise him: nor any deale the lesse, if all should be damned and curse him.
               
                   When thou hast stayed there awhile, and feasted thy desires vpon this high substance; descend againe by the same steps (as if it were vpon Iacobs ladder) and behold the same substance couered and disguised, not onely with humane flesh, but with all the miseries incident to humane flesh: not onely as a seruant, the basest sort of men; but as a most contemptible

seruant, suffering both such miseries, and such indignities as greater could not be endured; and offering himselfe in loue to vs, and obedience to his father, euen to death; euen to the most painefull and ignominious death of the crosse.
               This obedience of the Sonne, was farre more pleasing  to the Father, then the disobedience of the first man was offensiue: his glory by this obedience, is farre aboue the offence by the sinnes of all men: the odour of this sacrifice, offered with the fire of loue, vpon the altar of the crosse, was more sweete, then the fume of all the sinnes of the world was noisome. To vnderstand this we must conceiue, that as nothing is so hatefull to GOD as vice, so nothing is so precious as vertue and sanctitie. How acceptable then may we thinke this sacrifice to be, wherein so many vertues were conspicuous in the highest degree of perfection? Here was most perfect obedience. Here was most earnest zeale of the glory of the Father, to satisfie the offence and contempt against his diuine Maiesty. What need I speake of his high humility; by which he would be accounted worse then Barabbas? what of his most perfect patience, both in iniuries and in torments? what of his admirable fortitude and perseuerance, wherewith as a giant without stop or stay he performed his enterprise? But aboue all his loue was most illustrious; his loue, I say, both of the saluation of man, & of his Fathers glory. This loue made his wil so ready & his desire so great; that he was prepared to endure not onely the crosse, but a thousand deaths beside, in case the iustice of his

Father had so required. Hee loued much more then he suffered; and was ready to haue suffered much  more then he did, if it had beene so appointed. Wherfore if we consider a part, what he suffred, & what he was prepared in desire to haue suffred; wee may discern two most acceptable sacrifices: one, partly seen, in that which he suffered: another, altogether inuisi
                     ••
                  e, which was his will to haue suffered more then he did. And there is no doubt, but that the holy Father who principally respecteth the heart, did more accept the inward sacrifice of his will, then he did the sacrifice of the passion which he did outwardly both act & indure.
               
                   And seeing it is necessary that so great oblations merit a reward, it followeth that the father must reward the sonne: Otherwise he should be either vnable or vniust, both which are impossible. But there can be no recompence, but either in giuing that which one hath not, or in forgiuing that which he oweth; neither of which could bee done to our redeemer. For what could be giuen to him who wanted nothing? what forgiuen him who neuer offended? Therefore it is necessary, seeing a reward is due, and seeing it could not be giuen to himselfe; that it bee giuen to some other for him, to some other for whom hee will require it. But for whom should hee require it; if not for those for whom hee merited it? and to whom hee hath made himselfe an example? wherefore hath he commanded them to imitate his righteousnesse, if they shall not be partakers of his reward? whom should hee more iustly appoint for his heires, then his parents, his brethren, his children;

who are grieuous debtors, and for whom hee hath vndertaken payment? Assuredly, the father will driue no man from him, who commeth to him in the glori

               But stay a while, & pound these spices somwhat more O my soule; dwell a little vpon perusall of this rich  piece▪ what busines is this which is done with so great solemnitie? wherfore did the LORD sweare? was it not sufficient for him who is truth, to haue giuen his word? wherefore also doth he adde that hee will not repent? can the LORD repent of any thing that hee saith or doeth? Assuredly no. But all this is to confirme our confidence: that whatsoeuer petitions and importunities are offered in that sacred name, the eternall Father will neuer bee wearie to heare them, neuer vnwilling to grant them. Men doe often repent of their promises, when the performance of them is either aboue their power, or to their disaduantage. But the high wisedome of the father cannot be ouertaken with such ouersight: hee will neuer repent him of his promise; as knowing right well, both what he promised, and for whose sake. Hee hath consecrated his sonne to be a Priest for euer. Hee is alwayes in his sight, hee alwayes sheweth that holy humanitie, those deepe and wide woundes which he

receiued for our sake. This is his perpetuall representation, this the perpetuall intercession which hee maketh for vs: LORD open my mouth to praise thee, who hast opened so many mouthes as thou hast receiued wounds, to pray to thy father for mee.
               Blessed be such a redeemer, blessed be such an intercessour; blessed bee such prouidence and such power, either to preuent our miseries, or to preuaile against them. Cursed be our distrust, cursed our negligence whereby the benefit of our redemption is often lost. The father hath deliuered the keyes of his infinite treasure to his sonne, and our brother; to our flesh and blood. He hath opened them, he hath power to dispose them so largely as he please, and is pleased to doe it so largely as he can: but wee often faile, either in will to desire, or in capacitie to receiue them.
               
                   Indeede the capacitie of our hearts is so narrow and straite, that it seemeth a small thing would satisfie our desires. For when wee pray, wee so pray, that it seemeth a little would content vs: our heauinesse is such, that wee know neither how nor what to desire. So they who are in heauinesse, would bee content with a little comfort: they who are in pouertie, would be glad but of a little reliefe. But GOD thinketh not this enough: For hee giueth aboue all that wee can aske or receiue: no man either can or dare aske so much, as he is both willing and ready to giue. As wee slenderly beleeue, so wee slenderly aske; but GOD rayneth plentifully vpon the little

poore sparkes of our prayers; and if we can awaite the time, will recompence our stay with inestimable aboundance. GOD is the first who loueth, and the last who leaueth: he neuer forsaketh vs, vnlesse wee 
                     ••
                  rst giue ouer to trust in him, and pray vnto him. This it is to bee GOD; euen to redeeme and deliuer: and that with greater Maiestie and glory then can bee conceiued. GOD is plenteous in all his workes; but in none so plenteous as in his great worke of redemption.
               It was a merueilous redemption whereby the people of Israel was freed from the seuere seruitude of Egypt: but it was not like this whereof I speake, it was but a type and figure thereof. This redemption is vniuersall; it hath discharged not one people alone, but all the world: There is no sinne, not onely committed, but possible to be committed, which by this redemption is not discharged. And this is true in regard of sufficiencie; but in regard of efficacie it perteineth only to the elect; who are the Church, the true house and familie of Israel. But there can bee no offences, either for number so great, or for qualitie so grieuous, but this redemption is sufficient for them. Can this redemption which is of infinite value, bee restreined to any limits of offences? Shall not hee whose arme is neuer shortned, be alwayes able to forgiue? Shall not he who forgaue to one debtor 10000. talents, be alwayes willing to forgiue? verely in case that debtor had owed more talents, vpon his submission more had bin forgiuen. Such is the pitie of almighty GOD towards miserable men; that hee neuer

reiecteth their vnfained repentance: albeit a sinner be at the height of euill, let him in singlenesse and sinceritie of soule turne to the LORD, and he shall be embraced.
               
                   If you finde in the Scriptures any sinnes termed vnpardonable; as the sinne against the holy Ghost: the sinne vnto death:1. Iohn 5. for which wee are forbidden to pray: you must not vnderstand it as if they could not bee pardoned,
                     Sect. in 2. d. q. 3. in case the sinner did vnfainedly repent; for this were no better then bitter blasphemie.Psal. 65. v. 24. & 28. But such sinnes are said to bee vnpardonable, because they deserue blindnesse and hardnesse of heart, and to bee depriued of the effectuall ayde of Grace: because the sinner neuer either turneth or stoppeth, but alwayes runneth forward, from badde to worse.Psa. 69.24.28. 
                  Let their eyes bee blinded that they see not, and euer bowe downe their backes. Let them fall from one wickednesse to another, and not come into thy  righteousnesse. Not that GOD doeth positiuely blinde any man, or bowe downe their backes; but priuatiuelie; in that hee doeth not enlighten and direct them. His sufficient ayde hee denieth to none; but by reason of some, e
                     •
                  ther heinousnesse, or obstinacie in sinne, hee denyeth his most speciall and effectuall ayde to some. Hereupon their sinnes are sayde to bee vnpardonable; because, albeit they might repent, yet they did not.
               
                   Wherefore, O man! to bridle thy broad bouldnesse in sinne,
                     Aug. de vita Christi. c. 3. & 4 vnderstand that there are certaine periods and bounds, which when sinners exceede, GOD leaueth them destitute; sometimes by denying his

effectuall ayde, sometimes by abridging the terme of their life:Psal. 55. For the bloudie and deceitfull man shall not liue out halfe their dayes. When the number of sinnes prefixed by GOD are once exceeded, when the measure runneth ouer,
                     super tribus sceleribus Dam
                           •

                   when the sinner hath digged his owne pitte; Death shall come hastily vpon him, and take from him both the present and future life at once. Verely hee that hath appointed barres for the proud waues of the sea, hath also set limits and termes to thy sinnes: hee hath prefixed limits for his effectuall grace, but his aboundant redemption is alwayes sufficient.
               
               And therefore (O feeble sinner) albeit thou hast  offended the most High, and conspired against his Maiestie; albeit thou hast forsaken his Law, and forgotten his benefits; albeit thou hast harlotted with thy owne humours, and fouled his honour vnder thy feete; in a word, albeit thou hast merited more torments then hell canne afford, yet neuer despaire, neuer bee terrified by thy weake suspicions. But abstaine from thy sinnes, let thy will abhorre them; and then approach with trust to the throne of mercie: and assuredly thou shalt finde grace, not onely sufficient but effectuall for all thy sinnes. For then thy Redeemer by his inualuable blood will free thee from the seruitude of sinne, whereto thou haddest voluntary sould thy selfe; then will hee take vpon him the paine which thou haddest incurred; then discharge the obligation which thou haddest forfeited.
               But herewith thou must bee incorporate into the 
                  
family of Israel, namely the Church of GOD; thou must with Nathaniel be an Israelite indeede,
                  Io. 1. 
                  in whom is no guile: for to these onely this redemption pertaineth. Thou must earnestly endeauour first to bridle thy sensuall appetites, and by degrees to mortifie them. Thou must serue GOD in righteousnesse, and both constantly and closely adhere to him by loue. So shalt thou bee rightly disposed to participate of thy redemption: so shall riuers of heauenly riches flowe into thy soule. But whosoeuer is a stranger to this house of GOD, or liuing therein is no part thereof: whosoeuer (I say) doeth eyther obstinately or carelesly perseuer in sinne, and neuer regard to disingage himselfe by repentance; hee shall neuer participate of the infinite treasure of this redemption; the floudes of GODS mercies and of the merits of his Redeemer, shall neuer enter or approach his soule; they are sufficient, but not effectuall for his discharge.
               
                   And further, so ample and aboundant is this redemption, that thereby the LORD will deliuer his people, not onely from their sinnes and from eternall punishments due to their sinnes; but hee will finally free them, from the miseries and calamities which in this life driue in their faces. Or if hee deferre this deliuerance for a time, yea, if hee stay vntill hee deliuer them at once, from the calamities of the world and from the world it selfe; yet is hee present with them all the meane time; hee refresheth them with his spirit, he sprinckleth the diuine dewe of his Grace vpon them: which maketh aswell their

life, as the calamities of their life, not onely tolerable, but sweete. For they who beleeue, although they be faint and feeble hearted; yet they know, that neither death nor the diuell shall preuaile against them; because GOD is their Redeemer. This is the office of GOD, thus will hee haue to doe with sinners: to abolish their sinnes, to abolish either their miseries, or the sence of their miseries; and to create in them rig

                   the LORD doth not only eyther end or ease our miseries, but he doeth more: he conuerteth  them to our good. It is a propertie of the greatest goodnesse to change the nature of euill, and to conuert it into good. If a vine bee not pruned, it runneth out into superfluous stemmes and branches; and growes feeble and fruitlesse in the end. Bee content therefore, that thy desires be pruned with afflictions: It is painefull to bleede, but it is mortall to wither. In this life (pascimur & patimur) wee are so nourished with the blessings of GOD, that therewith also wee are nurtured with his crosses.
               And shall I tell thee, O my friend? shall I acquaint  thee with an infallible experience, how all the calamities of this life may not onely bee endured, but vtterly broken? how thou mayest obtaine a most glorious conquest? This is worth the knowing, and by assistance of grace not vneasie to bee done. The Apostle findeth in one man two: the spirit and the flesh; the minde and the members; the soule and the body. These are so chained together as they make but one; and yet so contrary, as they make two.

They are so contrary, as the life of the one, is the death of the other; the raising vp of the one, is the ruine of the other: whereupon the Scripture saith; that hee who loseth his life shall saue it. That is, hee who loseth his sensuall life, shall saue his spirituall life. Betweene these two men there is such a perpetual combate, that therupon the life of man is termed a warfare: betweene these two men, all the maine businesse of this life consistes.
               Now then, beate downe this mortall and bodily man, breake thy vnbrideled appetites, set aside thy carnall pleasures and desires; and thou shalt liue peaceably and at sweet content: no worldly troubles shall molest thee. Thou complainest of externall oppositions; but thy enemies are within, thy proper passions make warre against thee: Vanquish these enemies, and thy complaints will cease. He is a great LORD who commandes himselfe; hee who commandes, his owne will, is more powerfull then many  great kings. Many great kings cannot make their enemies to be friendes; but this is done by commanding thy will. For wherefore are iniuries and aduersities troublesome to thee? be
                     •
                  ause thou canst not endure them: thou esteemest them thy enemies, therefore they perplexe thee. But bee friendes with them, and loue them, and then they will not molest thee; then they will bee pleasant to thy taste, thou wilt be gladde then and glory in them. If worldly troubles bee grieuous to thee, the fault is in thy selfe, it is in thy power to loue them: doe but cutte off the desires of the world, and thou wilt neuer complaine of any

worldly thing. Complaine of thy inward desires  thou mayest; but of externall accidents thou canst not iustly complaine, because they cannot hurt thee vnlesse thou wilt. If any thing seemes grieuous to thee, take thy selfe in hand; chastice thy inward enemies, and thou shalt bee quiet. As moathes consume the cloath, and wormes the wood wherein they breede; So thy owne concupiscences consume thy heart. They gnawe thy bowels like the vipers broode, and worke out their birth by thy torment and death. It is most infallible, that no man is wronged but by himselfe. Thou art thine owne enemie. Master thy selfe, and thou shalt haue calme quiet and ioy of spirit. As swine will not wallow in drie clay; so distempered passions will not tumult in a mortified mind.
               Open my lippes, O LORD my GOD, that  my voyce may vent foorth those prayses to thee, which the boyling desire of my heart canne possibly frame: that it may exhaust the very spirit of my soule in praysing thee for this inestimable benefit of my redemption. Abase me to the knowledge of my selfe, abase mee in the knowledge of my selfe; to the end that I may aduance to the knowledge of this great misery.
               LORD, I haue nothing in my selfe to offer to  thee; either in recompence of all the good which thou hast done vnto me, or in satisfaction of all the euill which I haue done against thee: Whatsoeuer I haue is already thine, as flowing from thy plentifull hand▪ wherefore I offer them wholly to thee, to be directed

to thy seruice. And not onely all that I haue, but I offer my selfe to bee thy perpetuall seruant. That heereafter I no more bend or binde my selfe to accomplish my will, but thine: that I seek not my owne pleasure or aduantage, but what is pleasing and acceptable to thee. LORD, I prostrate my selfe before thy feet, I yeeld my selfe wholly into thy holy hands: deale with me as a Lord deales with his vassall or slaue, dispose of me euen as thou wilt.
               But because all this is no more then nothing, I approach with trust to thy throne of grace, and present to thee the most precious oblation, the most rich treasure that can be found in heauen or in earth; namely, the life, death, bloud, labours, vertues, and merits of my Redeemer: which albeit they were proper to him, in regard of his passion; yet in regard of his satisfaction, they are more mine then his. I offer to thee, I say, his base birth, his extreme pouerty, his trauailes and banishment, his precious teares, his blessed bloud, his baptisme, his temptation, all the contradictions and rude reuilings of his enemies, all the sowre sorrowes and torments of his passion: the whippes, the crowne of thornes, the nailes, the speare, the crosse and the tombe. I offer to thee his infinite zeale of thy glory, his perfect obedience to thy will, his ardent loue towards vs. I offer to thee, his incredible humility, his inuincible patience and gentlenesse, and all other glorious vertues which sparkled in him, as starres in the firmament, as precious stones in a princes crowne. I offer to thee all his merits; not as a treasure of others, but as my owne riches by inheritance.

His workes were finite, but the merits of his workes are infinite. I offer him wholly to thee; hee is wholly mine, in that his loue is mine. For when he gaue me his loue, he gaue me himselfe: sith loue is no gift vnlesse the giuer be giuen with it: yea it is no loue vnlesse it be as liberall of that which it is, as of that which it hath.
               O holy CHRIST! the repayrer of our life, the  sweetnesse of our soule, the refuge against our calamities; what flintie heart regarding what thou hast suffered, will not be enflamed with the fire of thy loue? will not aduance into hope of thy mercy?
               And blessed be thou, O All-powerfull, and All-mercifull GOD! who hast giuen vs such right and interest in him, that wee may make this oblation to thee, both in thankefulnesse for ALL thy benefits, and in full satisfaction for ALL our sinnes. I beseech thee, O LORD, for his sake, forgiue ALL my sinnes, who for our sake endured ALL the punishments of my sinnes. I will not enquire into the depth of this mystery, but I will embrace it with the loue of my will. The more incomprehensible it is, the more worthy is it the LORD who is incomprehensible; not onely in himselfe, but in his workes. He hath so loued vs, that he hath done many things for vs, which farre exceed the faculty of our vnderstanding: by which hee hath much more deserued our loue, then by those things which wee are able to vnderstand.
               
                  
                  Prayse, and Glory, and Wisedome,
and Strength, Dominion, Riches,
and Power bee vnto
our GOD for euermore.
               
            
            
               
               A SVMMARY PRAYER.
               
                  O Almightie GOD! the beginning & the end; in whom the beginning and the end are one: when thou diddest fashion and create man, his soule thou diddest frame

as of a most diuine matter;
                     He breathed in his face breath of life. Gen. 2.7. thy proper breath; so in a most diuine forme; euen in thy owne Image. For this glorious guest, thou diddest prepare the palace of his body,Gen 1.27. not onely commodious for vse, but curiously both framed, and furnished for delight. But afterwardes by reason of his transgression, this palace was turned to a prison: whereby it was much changed in condition. For as if a man for some offence be committed prisoner to his owne house, hee becommeth soone weary of the place, wherein hee tooke much pleasure before; especially if not onely in regard of himselfe, but in the proper nature his house bee turned to a prison: so albeit the body of man was once a pleasant habitation, yet when

by sinne it was turned to a prison; the soule findeth therein, many miserable molestations.
               A prison is a place horrid and vncleane; wherein the companions are theeues, murtherers, and other malefactours: the place commonly a sinke, whither all the filth of a city doth draine. And albeit a childe born
                     •
                   and brought vp in a prison, and neuer acquainted with other life, will laugh and desport, and not onely take contentment, but delight in that place; yet if an honest man who knoweth liberty, chance to come there, how is he annoyed with the filth? How with the vile society which he is constrained to endure? What friends, what suit will hee make for his discharge? So they who

neuer looked out of their body, are well pleased with the euill qualities thereof. But they who haue conuersed in a heauenly life, and yet are gayled in this prison of mud, and tied to the society of a thousand disordred appetites, as so many malefactors, how vnquiet are they? how wary? how desirous to be at liberty? Heereupon one cried,Psalm. 142 vlt. 
                  Bring my soule out of prison, and I will prayse thy name.
                  Philip. 1 And another: I desire to bee dissolued.
                  Rom. 7. And againe: Who shall deliuer me from this body of death.
               
               Out of the deepest dungeon of this prison (O LORD) I crie vnto thee: deepely couered with naturall corruption, deepely ouerwhelmed with actuall transgressions, deepely charged both with sence and feare

of thy wrath, I streine foorth my voice vnto thee. LORD, thou art alwayes farre distant from sinners, and now out of this deepe distance, I doe not weakly desire thee, but with deepe sighes and groanes from the depth of my heart, I call vnto thee. I haue sinned, and thou hast punished: I haue displeased thee, and thou hast disquieted me; according to the greatnesse of my sinnes, thy punishments haue beene great vpon mee. Out of this depth both of infirmities and of calamities, with an inflamed spirit, I lift vp my voyce, hands, eyes, and soule vnto thee. Heare me (O LORD) who doest no sooner heare then helpe: Oh! let the complaint of my sobbing soule haue accesse to thy gentle audience.

Looke not vpon my sinnes and vpon thy iustice; but looke vpon my miseries, and vpon thy mercies: turn away thy face from me, as I am sinfull, but regard me as I am sorrowfull for my sinnes. Despise not (O LORD!) the worke of thy hands.
               For thou knowest of what mettall we are made, thou knowest the bad temper thereof; thou knowest, not only our weakenesse, but our prone inclination to euill. Insomuch as if thou shouldest examine our actions by the exact ballance, and then smite them by the seuere sword of thy Iustice; all must despaire; wee must all bee damned. For there is none so innocent vnder heauen, who canne eyther answere thy Iustice or endure it. Not one canne

stand before thee in Iudgement; not one canne answere one for a thousand.
               
               But thou wilt not bee so rigid and seuere against thy feeble creatures. For with thee abideth not onely Iustice, but also Mercie; not onely Iustice, for obstinate sinners, but Mercie for the penitent. Thou art aboue measure milde and fauourable to all that repent; thou canst not deny thy Mercie from any who desire it from an humble heart. And therefore albeit my sinnes presse heauie vpon me, albeit they trouble my soule with many terrours; yet will I worship thee, with a dutifull and obedient feare. I will hope in thee, but not cease to feare: I will hope, but not

presume, and therefore must I feare. I will hope, in regard of thy goodnesse; I will feare, in regard of my owne euill: I will hope in thee for thy mercies, and I will feare thee for thy iustice.
               Vpon these two wings will I flie vnto thee; with these two eyes will I looke for thee: but my trust addresseth it selfe especially to thy mercy. 
                  
                     •
                  f this mercy thy word hath giuen assurance: thy word expresseth much fatherly affection; thy word is full of many sweet promises of remission of sinnes: and therefore my trust laieth hold vpon thy word. For were it not a dishonour to a King? would not people speake shrewdly of him, if hauing promised his pardon, hee would execute men for the same offence?

Assuredly, whatsoeuer some Kings may doe, thou canst not: thou canst not denie thy word, because thou canst not denie thy selfe. Thy iustice will not suffer thee, either to reuoke, or lightly to regard the promises of thy mercy, in case we apprehend them in seasonable time.
               And therefore I will not be either betrayed by pleasures, or benummed by sluggish sloath: I will not suffer time to passe, vntill time shall be altogether past: When there cannot possibly be any harme in haste, I will not aduenture vpon the dangers of delay. O LORD my maker! Quicken me with thy inciting grace, that I may with all speed addresse my selfe both to entreat and to embrace thy mercy; that I may timely begin to

attend vpon thee. For albeit no part of my life should be either shortned or mispent; Albeit I should be most couetously carefull to imploy euery minute thereof: yet is man too mortall to attaine performance of the least part of his duty to thee. And although I bee not presently releeued, although for a long time thou with-holdest thy helpe; let not my hope be wearied in wayting for thee; let me both patiently and constantly expect thy pleasure.
               And so must all doe who sincerely serue thee; who put their trust in thy word: and so they shall neuer be disappointed of their hope. For not only thy Mercy is most faithfully assured by thy word; but thy Iustice also is plentifully satisfied, by the inualuable

blood of our Redeemer: which is so noble and precious in thy sight, that there neither are, nor can be any sinnes, for expiation of which it doeth not suffice. It openeth the gate of grace to all that repent; it excludeth none, it sufficeth for all. Let no man feare the multitude of his sinnes; this Mercy and this Redemption doe infinitely surmount them: they infinitely ouerballance the sinnes of all men, in case they repent. LORD! thou art a great Physition; thou knowest all our sicknesses, and art most expert in all sorts of remedies. Whatsoeuer our diseases are, neuer so grieuous, neuer so desperate; thou hast variety of remedies in store, and knowest right well how to applie

them: thy Mercie and thy Redemption thou hast alwayes at hand.
               Wherefore with all feare and reuerence which my weakenesse is able to apprehend, I resort now to thy throne of Grace; most humbly entreating thy Mercie, and the benefit of thy plentifull redemption. Repell mee not from thy presence, I beseech thee; vntill I bee reconciled to thy fauour. For I am no stranger to thy house; I am one of thy people, a citizen and member of that Church, which thou hast so aboundantly redeemed. Grant mee (O gracious GOD!) a longing desire to be with thee; for whosoeuer desireth to be with thee, shall be welcome to thee; whosoeuer desireth not to be with thee, shall neuer

approach thee. Deliuer mee from all my sinnes; deliuer mee from al the calamities which I suffer in this life: and enroll mee for the life to come, among thy blessed elect Citizens of Heauen. That as heere with sinners I pray vnto thee, so there with thy Saints I may eternally prayse thee.
               AMEN.
            
            
               
               Prayse, and Glory, and Wisedome, and Strength, Dominion, Riches, and Power be vnto our GOD for euermore. Amen.
