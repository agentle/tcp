after his father Dauid, was annointed
king, they blew the trumpet, and
all the people said, God saue king Salomon,
and reioyced with great ioy, so
that the earth rang with the sound of
them. We haue thought, no trumpets, no
proclamations, no bonefires, no bells sufficient;
neither haue we heard the earth
onely ring-out, but also the heauens redouble

but that out of all countries & shires,
they runne and flocke together, to behold

all subiect doth not blesse God, and blesse
himselfe that he liues to see this happie
time, which was feared would prooue full
of great disorder and trouble, so wisely
and wonderfully caried (God as it were

that as none are more familiar with God
then godly Kings: so no treatises can be
more welcome to godly kings, then such
as may draw them into greatest familiaritie
with God. And I doubt not but
that your Highnes hauing hitherto had

your heart's desires giuen you, because
you haue delighted in the Lord, wil here
after, if it be possible, much more delight
in the Lord, that he may yet giue you
more desires of your heart. Nay I am so
farre from doubting of this, that I dare
be hold to conclude with the Psalmist.
                  The King shall reioyce in thy
strength,Psal. 21. 1. O Lord: exceeding glad
shall he be of thy saluation.
                  Thou hast giuen him his hearts
desire: and hast not denied him the
request of his lippes.
                  For thou shalt preuent him with
the blessings of goodnes: and shalt
set a crowne of pure gold vpon his
head.
                  His honour is great in thy saluation:
glorie and great worship shalt
thou lay vpon him.
                  For thou shalt giue him euerlasting
felicitie: and make him glad with the
ioy of thy countenance.
                  
                     
And why? Because the King putteth
his trust in the Lord: and in the
mercie of the most High he shall not
miscarie.

            THE TEXT.
            
               Delight thy selfe in the Lord, and he
shall giue thee the desires of thy heart.
               Psal. 37. 4.
            
            
               SAint Iohn saies in
one place, Loue not
the world, nor the
things of this world;
if any man loue the
world, the loue of
God is not in him.
So may I say, delight not in the world,
nor in the things of this world: if any
man delight himselfe in the world, he
cannot delight himselfe in the Lord.
Therefore saith Martial an auncient
Bishop,Quid ad no
                     •
                   delectatio msidi?

                  . What haue we to doe with
the delight of the world? You may

call it as you will; pleasure, if you will;
pastime, if you will; mirth, if you will;
gladnes, if you will; ioy, if you will:
but in Gods dictionarie it hath no
such name. In the holy Scripture, it is
otherwise called. It is called, Adams
goodly apple, which beeing eaten,
depriued him of Paradise; Esaus red
broth, which being supt vp, bereaued
him of his birthright; Ionathans
sweete honie-combe, which beeing
but tasted, was like to cost him his life;
the whore of Babylons golden cup,
which filled her full of all abhominations;
the traytour Iudas sugred sop,
which made a way for the deuill to
enter into him; the prodigall childes
wash or draffe, which he most miserably
swilled vp with the swine. Thus
is all the delight of the world called
in Gods dictionarie, which is the holy
Scripture. It is called Adams apple,
Esaus broth, Ionathans combe, Babylons
cup, Iudas soppe, the prodigall
childs swill. So that all this delight

is no delight. Or suppose it were: yet
certainly it shall not giue thee the desires
of thy heart. Nay it shall be so
farre from breeding thee those ioyes,
which thy heart most desireth, that it
shall bring thee those torments which
thy heart most abhorreth. It may,
saith Chrysostome,
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . delight thee perhaps
for a while, but sure it shall torment
thee for euer. As any sollide bodie,
though it haue neuer so faire a
colour (as crimson, or carnation, or
purple, or skarlet, or violet, or such
like) yet alwaies the shadowe of it is
blacke: so any earthly thing, though
it haue neuer so faire a shew, yet al
waies the shadow of it is blacke, and
the delight thou takest in it, shall
prooue to be grieuous in the ende.
Therefore Philo calleth it a sweet bitter

                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                thing. As that little booke in the
Reuelation, was sweete in the mouth,
but bitter in the bellie: so all worldly
delight, is a sweete bitter thing, sweete
in the beginning, but bitter in the ending.

Which they of Ierusalem had
experience of. For beeing giuen to
transitorie pleasure, they areLamen. 3. 15. saide to
be made drunken with wormewood.
Now we know that drunkennesse is
sweete, but wormewood is bitter. And
such a sweete bitter thing, such a drū
               kennes
of wormwood, is all the drunken
delight of the world. So that as
one said,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                
               Call me not Naomie, but call

                     〈◊〉
                   Mara, call me not sweete, but call
me bitter: so must we call worldly
delight, not Naomie, but Mara, because
it is nothing so much Naomie,
sweete and pleasant at the first, as it is
Mara and Amara, bitter and loathsome
at the last. Like to a song of the
Syrens, which are mentioned in the
propheciechap. 13. v. 22. of Esay. A Syren is a monster
of the sea, the head whereof resembleth
a virgin, but the feete a fish.
And such a monster is all worldly
delight, the head whereof, the beginning,
allureth vs as an amiable virgin,
but the feete, the ende, deuoureth vs

as a rauenous fish. Therefore as Vlysses
stopt his eares and bound himselfe
to the mast of the ship, that he
might not hea
                  •
               e the Syrens song: so
must we stoppe our eares, and refuse
to heare the voice of these charming
Syrens, charme they and sing they neuer
so sweetly; yea we must bind our
selues to the mast of the shippe, that
is, to the crosse of Christ,Si de Vlys

                  ? &c. Ambr. serm. 55 euery one
of vs saying with our heauenly Vlysses,
God forbid that I should delight
in any thing, but in the crosse of
Christ, by which the world is crucified
vnto me, and I vnto the world. For
the world and all worldly delight, is
likened to a hedgehogge.Esa. 14. 23. A hedgehogge
seemes to be but a poore silly
creature, not likely to doe any great
harme, yet indeede it is full of bristles
or prickles, whereby it may annoy a
man very shrewdly. So worldly delight
seemes to be little or nothing
dangerous at the first, yet afterward
as with bristles or pricks, it pearceth

through the very conscience with
vntollerable paines. Therefore we
must deale with this delight, as a man
would handle a hedgehogge. The
safest way to handle a hedgehogge is
to take him by the heele. So must we
deale with this delight. As Iacob took
Esau that rough hedgehogge by the
heele: in like sort we must take worldly
delight not by the head, but by the
heele, considering not the beginning,
but the ending of it, that so we may
neuer be deceiued by it. For though
it haue a faire shew at the first, yet it
hath a blacke shadow at the last:
though it be sweete at the first, yet it is
bitter at the last: though it be drunk
                  •
               nnes
at the first, yet it is wormewood
at the last
                  •
                though it be Naomie
at the first, yet it is Mara at the last:
though it be a song at the first, yet it is
a Syren at the last: though it be a silly
hedgehogge at the first, yet it is a
sharpe prickle at the last. Wherefore
delight not thy selfe in the world, for

it shall not giue thee the desires of thy
heart: but Delight thy selfe in the Lord,
and he shall giue thee the desires of thy
heart.
            
            Here is a precept: here is a promise.
A precept in these wordes, Delight
thy selfe in the Lord. First delight,
then thy selfe, lastly in the Lord. A promise
in these words, And he shall giue
thee the desires of thy heart, First, & he
shal giue thee, then, the desires, lastly, of
thy heart. Delight thy selfe in the Lord,
and he shall giue thee the desires of thy
heart.
            
            First, Delight. Well saies Synesius,

                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . The spirit of God, as it is a cheereful
thing it selfe, so it maketh all them
chearefull which are partakers of it.
Indeed the wicked cōtinually mourn
and lament. There was a great crie in
Egypt, because in euery house among
them, there was some one or other of
their first borne dead. But the voice of
ioy and gladnesse is in the tabernacles
of the righteous.Psal. 118. 15. They euermore

               delight in the Lord. I readAelianus in varia histo. l. 
                     •
                  . cap. 14. of one Leonides
a captaine, who perceining his
souldiers left their watch, vpon the
citie walles, and did nothing all the
daie long but quaffe and tipple in
alehouses neere adioyning, commanded
that the al
                  •
               houses should be remooued
from the place where they
stood, and set vp close by the walles.
That seeing the souldiers would neuer
keepe out of them, at the least wise
they might watch as well as drinke in
them. So, because pleasure we must
needs haue, & we cannot be kept frō
it, god hath appointed that we should
take Delight enough, and yet serue
him neuer a whit the lesse. For it is no
part of Gods meaning, when thou
enterest into his sweete seruice, that
thou shouldst abandon all delight,
but onely that thou shouldst change
the cause of thy delight. That whereas
before thou diddest delight in the seruice
of sinne, now thou shouldest delight
as much, or rather indeed a thousand

times more, in the seruice of the
Lord. It was not Gods will that I
                  •
               aak
should be sacrificed, but onely the
ramme. And so God would haue vs
sacrifice onely the ramme, that is, all
rammish and rancke delight of the
world. But as for Isaack, he must be
preserued still, and kept aliue: Isaack,
in whome Abraham did see the day
of Christ and reioyced: Isaack, that is
all spirituall laughter, all ghostly ioy,
all heauenly delight. For as no man
might come into the court of Ashuerus,
which was clothed in sackcloath:
Ester. 4. 2. so no man may come into the court
of our king, which is clothed in sackcl
                  •

and hath not on the wedding
garment of ioy and delight in the
Lord. Which is the cause why Christ

most stoutly against the enemie, then

they sing most merily vnto the lord.

                  m pugnantem. Moral. l. 27. cap. 27. I admire
king Dauid a great deale more, when
I see him in the quire, then when I see
him in the campe: when I see him singing
as the sweete singer of Israel,
then when I see him fighting as the
worthy warriour of Israel. For fighting
with others, he did ouercome all
others, but singing, & delighting himselfe,
he did ouercome himselfe. Eue
                  •
               
as his sonne Salomon saies for him,
speaking to Christ. Turne away
thine eies from me, for they doe ouercome
me, they wound my heart: they
make me sicke for loue
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  . 4. 6.. When Dauid
fought with others, he ouercame
others; he wounded others; he made
others sicke; but when he daunced
before the Arke, and delighted himselfe,
he was ouercome himselfe,
he was wounded himselfe, he was
sicke himselfe. But feare you nothing.
I warrant you this sickenesse
will doe him no harme. I will plaie

still (saies he) that others may stil play
vpon meLudam, inquit, vt illudar. Bonus ludu

                  reg. Mag.. For it is good sport whē
God is delighted, though Michol be
displeased. So that of Dauids sicknes
we may say, as Christ said of Lazarus
sicknesse. This sickenesse is not vnto
death, but for the glorie of GodIoh. 11. 4..
And therefore it is for the glorie of
God, because it is for the loue of god.
For Dauid is sicke no otherwise for
loue of the sonne of God, then God
is sicke himselfe, for loue of the sonne
of Dauid. This is my beloued sonne (saies
he) in wh
                     •
                  me I am delighted
               Math. 17. 5.. This is my
beloued sonne: there he is in loue. In
whome I am delighted: there he is sicke
for loue. Which is the cause why he
commandeth vs also to be delighted
in his loueProu. 5. 19.. For as a double desire is
loue: so a double loue is delight. And
therefore he saies not simply, loue
him; but, he delighted in his loue. Delight
thy selfe in the Lord, and he shall
giue thee the desires of thy heart. Delight.
            
            
               
Then, Thy selfe. I would hate mine
owne soule (saies Bernard) if I found
it any where else then in the Lord and
in his loue
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
               . So that it is not enough
for thee to delight, but thou must delight
thy selfe, that is, thy soule. Saying
with the blessed Virgin, My soule
doeth magnifie the Lord, and my spirit
reioyceth in God my Sauiour. Otherwise,
as Diues did see Lazarus a
farre off lying in Abrahams bosome,
beeing himselfe all the while tormented
in hell, and hauing not so much as
one drop of water to coole his tōgue:
so, eue
                  •
                in laughing the soule may be
sorrowfullPro
                     •
                  . 14. 13.. The wretched soule of
a sinner may see the face a farre off
laughing, and lying (as I may say) in
Abrahams bosome, beeing it selfe all
the while tormented (as it were) in hel▪
and hauing not so much as one drop
of delight to asswage the sorrowes of
it. And like as Sampsons lyon had
great store of honie in him, but tasted
no sweetnesse of it: euen so if thou reioyce

in the face, and not in the heart,
2. Cor. 5. 12. thou maiest well perhaps haue great
store of honie in thee to delight others;
but thou canst neuer taste the
sweetnesse of it to delight thy selfe.
Therfore saies the princely prophet,
O taste and see how sweet the Lord
is. It is not enough for thee, to see it a
farre off, & not haue it, as Diues did;
or, to haue it in thee, and not to tast it,
as the lyon did: but thou must as well
haue it as see it, and as well tast it as
haue it. O taste and see (saies he) how
sweete the Lord is. For so indeede
Christ giueth his Church, not onely a
sight but also a taste of his sweet

A sight is where he saies thus,Can. 7. 12. We
will rise vp earely, and goe into the
vineyard, and see whether the vine
haue budded forth the small grapes,
and whether the Pomegran
                  •

There is a sight of the vine. A
taste, is where he saies thus,Can. 8. 2. I will
bring thee into the winseller, & cause
thee to drinke spiced wine, and newe

               s. There is
a taste of the wine. The Church, not
onely goes into the vineyard, and sees
the wine, but also goes into the wineseller
and tastes the wine. But yet thou
must goe further then this, before
thou canst come to thy selfe. For there
are diuers degrees of tastes. The Egyptians
in their Hyroglyphickes,Or

when they would describe an vnperfect
taste, paint meate in the teeth,
when a more perfect taste, the beginning
of the throat. Such an vnperfect
taste had the Israelites of the sweetnes
of God. God was most sweete vnto
them, when he gaue them quailes to
eate. Yet while the meate was but in
their teeth, the wrath of God was
kindled against themNu

meate in the teeth: an vnperfect taste.
But the spouse of Christ hath a more
perfect taste of the sweetnesse of god.
For likening him to an apple tree, she
saies, I delight to sit vnder his shadow,
& his fruit is sweet vnto my throat.Can. 2. 3.
               
There is the beginning of the throat:
a more perfect tast. But notwithstanding
all this, thou art not yet come to
thy selfe. Therefore this taste must not
content thee: because this tast cannot
delight thee. For thy delight must not
sticke in thy teeth, or in thy throat,Non

the infinit light and loue of God, and
so being lifted vp farre aboue it selfe,
doeth now disdaine to stoupe downe
so lowe as 
                  •
               o it selfe. And therefore
doeth not delight it selfe in it selfe, but
delights it selfe in the Lord. Hereupon
a father saies, O lord, graunt that I

may knowNouerim me, nouerim te. my selfe, and know thee. That knowing my selfe and thee, I
may loath my selfe in my selfe, and delight
my selfe onely in thee. Truth indeede,
O man, so thou oughtst to doe,
saies God. For if thou didst know thy
selfe and me, then thou wouldest displease
thy selfe, and please me. But
because thou knowst neither thy selfe,
nor me, therefore thou dost please
thy selfe, and displease me. But the
time shall come, when thou shalt neither
please thy selfe, nor me. Not me,
because thou hast sinned: not thy
selfe, because thou shalt be burned.
So that then thou shalt please none,
but the deuill: both because thou hast
sinned, as he did in heauen, and also
because thou shalt be burned as he is
in hell. Therefore he that delights
himselfe in himselfe, delights not himselfe,
but onely the deuill in himselfe.
Whereas on the other side, he onely
delights himselfe, which not onely
delights himselfe, but addes also, In the

Lord; and so delights himselfe in vertue,
delights himselfe in godlines, delights
himselfe in God himselfe. This
Christ

                  ed?
He that leanes vpon himselfe, can neuer
abound in delights: but he alone
aboundeth in delights, which leaneth
vpon his welbeloued. So did S. Paul:
I ha
                     •

he. There he abound

Yet not I, but the grace of God which is
in me. There he leaneth vpon his welbeloued.
And again, I can doe al things,
saies he. There he aboundeth in delights.
In him that strengtheneth me.
There he leaneth vpon his welbeloued.
In one word, when as he saies, He
that would reioyce and glorie, let him▪
reioyce and glorie in the Lord: it is all
one, as if he should haue said, He that
would abound in delights, let him
leane vpon his welbeloued. Let him

delight himselfe in the Lord. Let the
SaintsIn letitia letentur. psal. 68. 3. reioyce in ioy, let them delight
in delight. He that delights in an
earthly thing, delights in vanitie, he
delights not in delight. But he onely
delights in delight, which makes God
onely the ground of his delight. According

Sapi. 16. 20. had all manner of good tasts in it:
so the Lord onely, hath all manner of
good things, all manner of true delights
in him. Therefore the Church,
hauing first bestowed the greatest
part of Salomons song, altogether in
commendation of the beautie and
comelines of Christ, at length concludeth
thus; Thy mouth is as sweete

things, and thou art wholly delectable:
how faire art thou, and how pleasant
art thou, O my loue, in pleasures?
So that when I seeke my loue, my
Lord, then I seeke a delight, & a light,
that passeth all lights, which no eye
hath seene: I seeke a sound & an harmonie,
that passeth all harmonies,
which no eare hath heard: I seeke a
sent and a sauour, that passeth all sauours,
which no sense hath smelt: I
seeke a relish and a tast, that passeth
all tasts, which no tongue hath tasted:
I seeke a contentment and a pleasure,
that passeth all pleasures, which no
bodie hath felt. Nay, I cannot hold my
heart, for my ioy; yea, I cannot hold
my ioy, for my heart, to thinke that he
which is my Lord, is now become my
father, & so that he which was offended
with me, for my sinnes sake, is
now reconciled to me, for his sonnes
sake. To thinke, that the high Maiestie

of the dust, and so that I, which am

now a poore worme vpon earth, shall
hereafter be a glorious Saint in heauen.
This, this makes me delight my
selfe in the Lord; saying, O thou that
art the delight of my delight; the life
of my life; the soule of my soule; I
delight my selfe in thee, I liue onely
for thee, I offer my selfe vnto thee,

writers: and all the grasse piles vpon
the earth were pennes: and all the
water

                in the sea were ynke: yet, I assure
you faithfully, all these bookes,
all these writers, all these pennes, all
this ynke, would not be sufficient to
describe the very least part, either of
the goodnes of the Lord in himselfe,
or of the louing kindnes of the Lord,
towards thee. Wherefore, Delight thy
selfe in the Lord, and he shall giue thee
the desires of thy heart. Thus much for

the precept, in these words, Delight
thy selfe in the Lord.

to reward his owne mercies, as if

but wholly his: so he chaungeth the

                  ..
Especially it is a diuine thing, to loue
so dearely, as God loueth vs. Who,
though he doe not loue to erre, yet

he doeth erre for loue. Counting and
calling, that which is onely our commoditie,
his owne commoditie. So,
Christ is saidCan. 2. 16. to be fed amongst the
lylies. The lylies of the fieldes, are the
millions of the angelsLilia agro rum, millia angelorum. or of all those
which lead a pure, and an angelicall
life. These indeede Christ feedeth. He
feedeth them in the greene pastures,
and leadeth them forth, by the waters
of comfort. Yea, not onely he feedeth
them, but also by this figure, the error
of loue, he is said to be fed with them.
Because though he for his part, haue

                  •

open the doore, I will suppe with him, and
he with me
               Reu. 3. 20.. We indeede sup with
Christ. Generally, whensoeuer he
giues vs grace to feele in our affections,
the rauishing ioyes of the spirit.
As when he saies, I haue eaten my honie
combe, with my hony, I haue

drunken my wine, with my milke: eat
you also, O my friendes, drinke and
make you merie, O my welbeloued.
But more especially we suppe with
Christ, when he cals vs to the holy
Communion, and biddes vs to the
Lords supper. For then he staies vs
with flaggons, and comforts vs with
Cant. 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                apples: with apples and flaggons:
with bread and wine: with his owne
deere bodie, and his owne pretious
blood. Thus do we suppe with Christ.
But how doth Christ suppe with vs?
Is it possible? possible, that he which
shall neuer hunger, or thirst any
more? possible, that he, which is fulnes
it selfe, in whome, all the fulnes of
the Godhead bodily dwelleth? Is it
possible (I say) that he should stand
without, knocking at the doore, as a
begger, to get a meales meate of vs?
Yea sure: doubt you not. It is possible
enough. By a certaine figure, (I
weene you call it the errour of loue:
thats it: by this figure, the errour of

loue) it is a very possible thing: nay, it
is a very easie thing to doe: yea it is a
very great pleasure to him to doe it.
Behold (saies he) I stand at the dore and
kn

                  cke: if any man heare my voice, and

                     •
                  re, I will come in vnto him,
and will suppe with him, and he with me.
Well then, how doth Christ suppe
with vs? Christ suppe
                  •
                with vs, when
we entertaine him, as Marie did, with
the salt teares of repentance & griefe:
and as Lot did, with the sweete bread
of sinceritie, and truth. For the salt
teares of our repentance, are the onely
drinke, which Christ will drinke
with vs. And the sweete bread of our
sinceritie, is the onely bread, which
Christ will eate with vs. But what
meate hath he to his bread? I haue a
meate (saies he) which you know not
of. My meate is to doe the will of him
that sent me. In the volume of thy
book it is written of me, that I should
doe thy will, O my God, it is my delight,
it is meate and drinke to me, to

doe it. And as it is meate to him, to
doe it himselfe: so is it meate to him,
to see vas doe it. Then doth he suppe
with vs. And this is the first seruice.
But what hath he for a second course?
A dish of apples, gathered of the tree
of life. For toward the latter ende of
the supper, when they come to their
fruit, a Christian saies to Christ,Can. 7. 13. Omnia pom
                     •
                   vetera & nova. Vulgata trans.

                  .
Contrition, humiliation, denying of
thy selfe, mortificatiō of the old man:
these are old apples. Sobrietie, innocencie,
holines of life, viuification of
the new man: these are new apples.
And when a Christian feasts, & feedes
Christ with such diuers and daintie
fruits of righteousnes, then he saies to
him, O my welbeloued, I haue kept for
thee all manner of apples, both old and
new. But what musicke hath 
                  •
               e now?
We must needes haue some musicke.
Christ cannot suppe without musick.
Drinke, and bread, and meate, and

apples, will make him but a slender
supper, except we mend it all the better
with musicke. This must be the
very best part of the supper. For a c
                     •
                  
                  ̄

pleasant
               Ecclesiasticus cap. 32. vers. 5. 
               banquet. Therefore when
Christ supps with vs, we must be sure
he haue musicke. We must welcome
him, and cheare him vp, with psal
                     •
                  es,
and hymnes, and spirituall songes, singing

with vs. But nowe to returne to the
maine point againe, from which we
haue a little digressed, As else where,
by the errour of loue, Christ is said, to
be fedde among the lylies, whereas indeede

man of God, as Moses was: if thou be
a friend of God, as Iohn was: if thou
be a begger of God, as Lazarus was:
he shall giue thee all that thou canst
begge, or desire. For, to speake no
more of those three children, these
three men, which I named last vnto
you; Moses, the man of God: Iohn the
friend of God: Lazarus, the begger
of God; did lie in three bosomes. In
Moses bosome: in Christs bosome: in
Abrahams bosome. Moses hand, did
lie in Moses bosome
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
               : S. Iohn did
lie in Christs bosome: Lazarus, did lie

in Abrahams bosome. Moses bosome,
is lawe: Christs bosome, is Gospel:
Abrahams bosome is glorie.
Therefore, feare must driue thee out
of Moses bosome: faith must keepe
thee in Christs bosome: felicitie must
bring thee to Abrahams bosome. For
first, thou must with Moses, put thy
hand into Moses bosome, and there
seeing how full of leprosie thy hand
is, and howe wicked all thine owne
handy workes are, thou must abhorre
thy selfe, in thy selfe. Afterward, thou
must with Iohn, conu
                  •
               ie not thy had
onely, but thy whole bodie, and thy
soule also, into Christs bosome, and
there seeing how thou art▪ clensed frō
the leprosie of thy sinne, and freely iustified
by faith in Christ, thou must
delight thy selfe in the Lord. Then,
thou must be carried into Abrahams
bosome, and there, both louing to desire
God, and desiring to loue God,
he shall giue thee thy desires. First, I
say, lie in Moses bosome, and abhorre

horre thy selfe in thy selfe: afterward,
lie in Christs bosome, and delight thy
selfe in the Lord: then, thou shalt lie
in Abrahams bosome, (O blessed bosome!
O sweet bosome!) And he shall
giue thee, thy desires. Delight thy selfe
in the Lord, and he shall giue thee the
desires of thy heart. The desires.
            
            Lastly, Of thy heart. Thy heart
here, is all one with thy selfe before. As
if the words had stood thus, Delight
thy selfe in the Lord, and he shall giue
thee the desires of thy selfe: or els
thus, Delight thy heart in the Lord,
and he shall giue thee the desires of
thy heart. To the point then. Augustine

was boyled in the bowels of the

to his soule, My soule returne vnto

whereas before, thou hadst lost thy
selfe: lost thy selfe in the tempest: lost
thy selfe in the sea: lost thy selfe in the
whale: nowe the Lord hath restored
thy selfe vnto thee. Wherefore the
heart of man hath lost all rest; nay it
hath lost it selfe, before it be cast vpon
the sea shore; before it be cast vpon
God: but when once it delighteth in
the Lord, when once it findeth God,
then it findeth it selfe, thē it returneth
vnto rest. Nicaula queene of Saba,
could neuer be quiet in her owne
countrie, till shee came to Salomon:
but when shee sawe his glorie, and
heard his wisdome, then her heart

failed her, shee had enough, she could
desire to see and heart no more. And
so the heart of a Christian, can neuer
be quiet in the straunge countrie of
this world, till it come to Christ,
which is the true Salomon, the prince
of peace; whē it comes once to Christ
then it saies thus to God, Lord nowe
lettest thou thy seruant depart in

I haue seene them; then I am quiet

finde no rest for the sole of her foote,
all the while she was flickering ouer
the flond, till she returned to the arke,
with an oliue branch in her mouht: so

the heart: of a christian, which is the
turtle doue of Christ, can find no rest
all the while it is houering ouer the
waters of this world, till it haue siluer
wings as a doue, and with the oliue
branch of faith, flie to the true Noah,
which signifieth rest, till Iesus Christ
put forth his holy hād out of the arke,
and taking this heart into his hand,
receiue it to himselfe. Euen as one
good heart saies for all, I will not
climbe vp into my bedd, nor suffer
mine eies to sleepe, nor mine eielidds
to slumber, nor the temples of my
head to take their rest, vntill I find a
tabernacle for the Lord, an habitation
for the mightie God ofPsal. 132. 4. Iacob. Vntill
I find, that my heart is not in mine
owne hand, but in Gods hand: vntill
I find, that God dwelleth in me, and
I in him: vntill I find, that my soule is
a tabernacle for the Lord, and my
heart is an habitation for the mighty
God of Iacob, I cannot rest, saies he.
But when I find this once: when I

come to Noah in the arke: when I
delight my selfe in the Lord; then I
will climbe vp into my bedd, and suffer
mine eies to sleepe, and mine eieliddes
to slumber, and the temples of
my head to take their rest. But whats
the reason of all this? I am somewhat
bold to aske, because I would be glad
to know: whats the reason I say, that
the bull, can neuer be quiet, till he
come to the staule; that the bucket,
can neuer be quiet, till it come to the
water; that the needle, can neuer be
quiet, till it come to the north poole;
that Ionas, can neuer be quiet, till he
come to the sea shore; that Nicaula,
can neuer be quiet, till she come to
Salomon; that Noahs doue, can neuer
be quiet, till it come to the arke;
that mans heart, can neuer be quiet,
till it come to God? The reason of it is
this. When God created heauen and
earth, he rested not in the heauen, or
in any heauēly thing, not in the earth,
or in any earthly thing, but onely in

man, which is both. A heauenly thing
for his soule, and an earthly thing for
his bodie. As soone as he had made
man, he kept a sabboth, and rested.
Euen so the heart of man, resteth not
in the earth, or in any earthly thing,
not in the heauen, or in any heauenly
thing, but onely in God, which is
lord of both. Lord of heauen and
earth: Lord of soule and bodie. As
soone as it commeth to God, and delighteth
in him, it keepeth holy-day,
and resteth. Gods heart neuer resteth,
till it come to man: mans heart neuer
resteth till it come to God. For as god

kind of foode proper vnto it. Offer a

the world, which is as the flower of
Esa. 40. 6. grasse, it is neuer a whit the better

Offer it Christ, who saies, My flesh is
meate indeede, then it is satisfied. Therfore
one saies, The lyons want, and suffer
hunger, but they that feare the Lord,
want no manner of thing that is good.
The lyons: such lyons, as haue no
grace, but grasse onely to feede vpon,
they want and suffer hunger. Hungrie
and thirstie their soule fainteth in
Psal. 107. 5. them. But they that feare the Lord:
such lyons, as by faith feede vpon the
flesh of Christ, delight in the Lord,
feede vpon God, they are fat, and well
liking, they want no manner of thing
that is good. For as the people sitting
vpon the grasse, and feeding vpon
the bread, were allMark. 6. 39. satisfied: so these
lyons are all satisfied, because sitting
vpon the grasse of the world, yea not
onely sitting vpon it, but also treading
vpon it, and trampling it vnder
their feete, they feede onely vpon the
bread of life. For these lyons can easily
conceiue, that if at that time, fiue
loaues beeing blessed by our Lord,

did satisfie fiue thousand, then much
more our blessed Lord himselfe, can
satisfie euery heart, which hungreth
and thirsteth for him. Therefore
these lyons, saue the very fragments
of this feast, and keepe them in their
hearts, as in baskets, knowing that all
the grasse of the world, cannot doe
them halfe so much good, as the very
least crumme of Christs comfort.
For so one lyon saies among the rest,
My soule refuseth comfort. But when
I remember God, I am
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                
               delighted. As
if he should say, I haue a lyons heart
in me; my soule refuseth to feede vpon
the grasse of the world: it goes against
my stomack: I cannot brooke
it; I cannot digest it: thats but a cold
comfort: My soule refuseth all such
comfort: But when I remember God, I
am delighted. Though I cannot see
God presently before me; yet if I doe
but remember him; if doe but meditate
of him; if I doe but thinke of him;
if I doe but dreame of him; I am
                  
                     〈…〉
                  . delighted.

Though I cānot haue a whol
loafe, yet if I can get but a fragmēt: if I
can get but a shieue: if I can get but a
morsell: if I can but any little crumme
of comfort, that falls from the table
of the Lord; my heart is sufficiently
refreshed and fedde. But as God onely
feedeth the heart: so God only filleth
the heart. For the heart of man, as
for the manner of diet, it is like the
heart of a lyon: so for the bignesse of
it, it is like the heart of the Ibis. Orus
Apollo writeth, that the Egyptians,
when they would describe the heart,
paint that bird, which they call the Ibis.
Because they thinke that no creature,
for proportion of the bodie, hath
so great a heart, as the Ibis hath. But
me thinkes, they might better paint a
man. Because no creature, no not the
Ibis it selfe, hath so great a heart, as a
man hath.Eccles. 1. 8. For the eie is neuer filled
with seeing, nor the eare with hearing,
and much lesse, the heart with
desiring. But euen as the Poets faine,

that the fiftie daughters of king Danaus
killing their husbands, are inioyned
for their punishment in hell, to
fill a tunne with water, that is bored
full of holes, which though they labour
neuer so much about it, yet they
can neuer bring to pass

               : semblably,
he that would goe about to fill his
heart, with worldly delightes, were
as good poure water into a fiue, as we
say, for any pleasure he shall haue,
after all his labour and paines. Salomon,
hauing had a long time, tryall
of all transitorie pleasures, at length
frankly confessed, that they were so
farr from being a contentation to his
heart, that they were a very great vexation
to his spirit. Nay Alexander▪
though he had conquered the whole
world, yet still he said with the king
of Spaine, Non sufficit arbi
                     •

                     〈…〉
                  
               : yea in
the ende, he grew to be very malecontent,
and found himselfe greatly
greiued, because there were not forsooth,
many more worldes for him

to conquer. By which example of
Salomon and Alexander, (though otherwise
a heathen,) it doth plainly
appeare, that if it had pleased God, to
haue created as many worlds, as there
are creatures in this one world, (which
he might haue done with the least
word of his mouth,) yet this infinite
number of worldes, which should
haue beene created, could not haue
filled the verie least heart, of any one
man, without the creatour himselfe.
This Orontius an excellent Mathematitian
sheweth, who describing the
whole world in the forme of an heart,
leaueth many voide spaces in his heart
which he cannot fil vp with the world.
For as a circle, can neuer fill a triangle,
but alwaies there will be three empty
corners in the triangle vnfilled, if there
be nothing els to fill it, but the circle:
so the round world, which is a circle,
can neuer fill the heart of man, which
is a triangle, made according to the image
of the Trinity, but alwaies there

will be some emptie corners, in the
triangle of the heart vnfilled, if there
be nothing els to fill it, but the circle
of the world. Onely the glorious trinitie,
filleth the triangle of the heart,
and filleth euery corner of it, and filleth
euery corner of it fuller, then it
can possibly

                hold. For, suppose almightie
God should now worke a
miracle, and giue some one man a
heart, as large, and as huge, not onely
as all the hearts of all the men, that euer
were, are, or shall be, but also as
all the affections of all the angels, and
heauenly powers aboue; yea I will
say that, which shall be yet much
more maruelous, if this one heart
were so great, that it could at one instant,
actually containe in it, more
corporall and spirituall things, then
are in all the deepes beneath, in the
vallies, in the mountaines, and in all
the heauens aboue: yet as true as
God is in heauen, this so large, and so
huge a heart, could not be able to hold

the very least part, of the perfection
of God; but if one droppe of his deitie
and glorie, were powred into it, by
and by it would burst in a hundreth
pieces, and flie a sunder, as an old vessel,
filled with newBehold the heauens and the heauens of heauens are not able to containe thee. 1. Reg. 8. 27. wine. O what a
wonderfull strange thing is this? what
shall we deuise to say of it? Ten thousand
worlds, cannot fill one heart: and
yet ten thousand hearts, cannot hold
one God. Therefore, as much as one
heart, is too good and too great, for
ten thousand worlds: so much is one
God, too good and too great, for ten

Armenia, a noble ladie, beeing bidden
to king Cyrus wedding, went thither
with her husband. At night, when
they were returned home, her husband
asked her, how shee liked the
bridegroo
                  •
               e, whither shee thought
him to be a faire and beautiful prince,
or no? Truth, saies shee, I know not.
For all the while I was forth, I cast
mine eyes vpon none other, but vpon
thy selfe. So basely did this noble ladie
esteeme of king Cyrus beautie,
who was the Monarch of the world,
in respect of that entire good will and

affection, shee bare to her husband,
which was so great, that her eyes
could neuer be from him. And so
must we, set God alwaies before our
eyes, and not once looke aside, or be
enamoured with any gaud of worldly
glorie, but despise euery blaze of
beautie whatsoeuer, that may draw vs
from beholding our heauenly husband,
and delighting onely in him,
which is fairer then the children of
men. S. Paul beeing rapt vp to the
third heauen, knowes not, whither it
were with the bodie, or without the
bodie. And because we should marke
it well once, he sets it downe twise.
That he was rapt vp to the third heauen,
he is sure; that he heard words
which no man can vtter, he is sure;
that he was exceedingly delighted in
the Lord, he is sure. But whither his
bodie were with him or no, he knows
not. So much did he forget and neglect,
euen his owne bodie, which is
so neere, and so deare a thing, in comparison

parison of that incomparable delight,
which then he tooke in the Lord. S.
Peter, seeing but a glimps of Christs
glorie, vpon mount Tabor, stood so
astonished and amazed with it, that
he was in a sort beside himselfe, when
he was at that time beside Christ.
Master, saies he, it is good for vs to be
here. As if he should haue said, Nowe
farewell Galilie, and all my goods:
farewell fellow Disciples, and all my
friends: farewell wife, & all the world:
so I may inioy this heauenly sight, and
be continually thus delighted in the
Lord. Holy Ignatius, going to his
martyrdome, was so strangely rauished
with this delight, that he burst out
into these wordes, Nay, come fires;
come beasts: come breaking of all my
bones: come racking of my whole bodie:
come all the torments of the deuill
togither vpon me: come what can
come, in the whole earth, or in hell either
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .,
so that I may inioy Iesus
Christ, and may be continually delighted
in the Lord. And so must thou

(deare brother) insult ouer all creatures,
and exsult only in thy creatour.
Thou must contemne all beautie, as
Armenia did: yea thine owne bodie,
as Paul did: yea all the world as Peter
did: yea thy very life, as Ignatius
did: and be content to doe any thing,
though it were to be torne and pulled
in a thousand peeces: or for a time, if
it were possible, to suffer al the paines
which the fiends and furies of hell can
inflict vpon thee, so as in the end, thou
maiest delight, either the Lord in thy
selfe, or thy selfe in the Lord. Then,
then He shall giue thee: and not, He
shall giue thee onely, but The desires,
also: and not The desires onely, but
Of thy heart, also. Then he shall giue
thee the desires of thy heart. And againe
I say, He shall giue thee: and againe
I say, The desires: and againe I
say, Of thy heart. Then he shall giue thee
the desires of thy heart. Then, though
thou haue a long time plaied the vnthrift,
and wasted all thy goods in the

world: yet, if with the lost childe, thou
returne home againe, to thy fathers
house, he shall graunt thee thy hearts
desire, and receiue thee with minstrelsie
and dauncing, and all manner of
festiuall ioy, and that plentie of bread,
which nourisheth euery hired seruant
in his house, shall much more feede
thee, which art his louing child, vnto
euerlasting life. Then, though all the
leekes and onyons of Egypt, which is
the world, haue failed thee: yet, if with
Israel, thou depend onely vpon God,
he shall distill the dewe of his grace,
into thy heart, and lay aside a chosen
raine for thee, and cause thee to
drinke of the sweete christall streams
of his pleasure, and giue thee to eate
of that hidden and heauenly Manna,
which no man knoweth, but he that
receiueth it. Then, though all the
clothes and couerings in the world,
cannot keepe thee warme; yet, if with
Dauid, thou be a man according to
Gods owne heart, he shall send thee

that mysticall Abishag, which shall
comfort thy heart, and make thee hot
and feruent in spirit, which shall renue
thy strength and make thee yong
againe, and lustie as an Eagle. Then,
though thou haue a long time lost thy
labour, in seruing Laban, which is the
world: yet, if with Iacob thou returne
home againe to thy fathers house, god
shall meete thee by the way, and, as
the Prophet Osey speaketh, he shall
allure thee as thy paramour, and lead
thee into the wildernesse, and there
speake according to thine own heart,
friendly, and louingly vnto thee. And,
euen as louers, are oftentimes disposed
for the nonce, to take a fall of one
another, the stronger of the weaker:
so God shall wrestle a fall with thee,
as he did with Iacob, and yeeld so
much in loue to thee, as that he shall
suffer thee to giue him the fall, and to
preuaile against him. Iesus: what exceeding
loue is this? why are we not
euen nowe, in the name of God, inflamed

with the loue of God: and wholly
rauished with delight in the Lord?
At least wise I maruell, what a mischeife
many base minded worldlings
meane, that they had rather feed
vpon the huskes of hogges, then the
bread of mā? that they had rather eate,
the ony ons of Egipt, then the manna
of heauen? that they had rather lie
acold, frozen and shiuering in sinne,
then be reuiued and cherished by Abishag?
that they had rather take vnsupportable
paine, to serue Laban,
then take vnspeakeable pleasure, to
serue God? Fy vpon it: what a vile
folly is this? what a starke madnes is
this? what is this els, but to be euen bodily
tormented, whereas they might
be most spiritually delighted? what is
this els, but to goe out of one hell, into
another hell, where as they might
goe out of one heauen into another
heauen? For, why do you (beloued)
why doe you tell me so much, of I
know not what: of a worme, that neuer

dieth? of a fire, that neuer is quenched?
of a lake, that burneth with brimstone?
of weeping, and gnashing of
teeth? Thus I tell you (good christians)
and I tell you truly, and God in
heauen heares what I say, though you
heare me not; I tell you as loud as euer
I can; that, to serue sinne so slauishly:
to please the deuill so wretchedly: to
delight in the word so brutishly, as
many men doe: this is worse then all
wormes: worse then all fires: worse
then all lakes: worse then all weeping:
worse then hell it selfe. Whereas, on
the other side, to serue God, to please
God▪ to delight in God, to reioyce &
solace thy soule in the Lord, which
hath alwaies giuen thee, and will alwaies
giue thee, the desires of thy
heart; this is better then all treasures:
better then all crownes: better then all
kingdomes: better then all immortalitie:
better then heauen it selfe. This,
this it is, which shall bring thee, out of
one paradise, into another paradise.
