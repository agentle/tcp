               As I could neuer spend one idle walke,
               But Ned and I would peece it out with talke.
               So you my Lord when you haue got your Ione,

               Balioll.
               
                  I tooke this lesson Edward from my booke,
               To keepe a iust equality of minde,
               Content with euery fortune as it comes,
               So can

               Balioll.
               Then will I keepe insilence what I meane,
               
                  
Since Edward thinkes my meaning is not good.
            
            
               Edmund.
               Naie Balioll speake forth, if there yet remain,
               A little remnant of perswading Art.
            
            
               Balioll.
               If cunning haue power to win the king,
               Let those imploy it that can flatter him.
               If honored deede may reconcile the King,
               It lies in me to giue and him to take.
            
            
               Edward.
               Why what remains for Balioll now to giue?
            
            
               Balioll.

               The greater hope in them that once haue falne.
            
            
               Edward.

               O sweete aflwagers of our martiall misse,
               Desired death depriue me of my life,
               That I in death maie end my life and loue.
            
            
               King.
               
                  Gloster thy King is partner of thy heauines,
               Although nor tongue nor eies bewraie his meane,
               For I haue lost a flowre as faire as thine,
               
                  
A loue more deare, For Elinor is dead,
               But since the heauen lie ordinance decrees,
               That all thinges change in their prefixed time,
               Be thou content and beare it in thy breast,
               Thy swelling griefe as needes I must mine,
               Thy Ione of Acon and my Queene deceast,
               Shall haue that Honor as beseemes their state.
               You peeres of England, see in ro

                   bodies be entombed straight
               With tried colours couered all with blacke,
               Let Spanish steedes as swift as sleeting winde,
               Conuaie these Princes to their sunerall,
               Before them let a hundred mourners ride,
               In euerie time of their enforste aboade,
               Reare vp a crosse in token of their worke,
               Whereon faire Elinors picture shall be plaste,
               Arriued at London neare our Pallas bounds,
               Interre my louelie Elinor late deceast,
               And in remembraunce of her roialtie,
               Erect a rich and statelie carued Crosse,
               Whereon her stature shall with glorie shine,
               And hence forth see you call it Charing crosse,
               For why the chancest and the choisest Queene,
               That euer did delight my roiall eies,
               Their dwell in darkenes whilst I die in griefe,
               But soft, what tidings with these Purciuants?

               How nature store in them to shew their Art,
               In shine, in shape, in colour and compare,
               But now hath death the enemie of loue,
               Staind and deformed, the shine, the shape, the reede,
               With pale and dimnes, and my loue is dead.
               Ah dead my loue, vile wretch whicam I liuing?
               So willeth fates, and I must be contented,
               All pompe in time must fade and grow to nothing,

               Then cease my sighs since I maie not regaine her,
