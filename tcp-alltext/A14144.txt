Forthermore as the huſbonde marieth not his wife / yt ſhe ſhulde contynue vnfrutefull as before / & as ſhe was in y• ſtate of virginire (where in it was īpoſſible for hyr to bere frute) but cōtrary wife to make hir frutefull: even ſo fayth iuſtifieth vs not / that is to ſaye / maryeth vs not to God / yt we ſhuld continue vnfrutefull as before / but that he ſhulde put the ſeade of his holy ſprite in vs (as ſainte John in his firſt piſtle calleth it) and to make vs frutefull. For ſayth Paule Epheſ. ij. By grace are ye made ſafe thorowe fayth / and yt not of your ſelves: for it is the gift of God ād cometh nor of the workes / leſt any man ſhulde boſt hym ſelfe. For we are his workemanſhipp created in Chriſte Jeſu vnto good workes / which God hath ordeyned yt we ſhulde walke in them.

               GRace and peace with all maner ſpirituall fealinge and livinge worthy of the kyndnes of Chriſt / be with the reader and with all that thurſt the will of God Amē. The cauſe why I ſett my name before this litle treatyſe ād have not rather done it in the new teſtament is that then I folowed the cownſelf of Chriſt which exhorteth men Matth. vj. to doo theyr good deades ſecretly ād to be contēt with the cōſcience of well doynge / and that God ſeeth vs / and paciently to abyde the rewarde of the laſt daye which Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs ād now wold fayne have done lyke wyſe / but am compelled other wiſe to doo.
            While I abode a faythfull cōpanyon which now hath takē a nother vyage apō him / to preach Chriſt where (I ſuppoſe) he was never yet preached (God which putt in his herte thither to goo ſende his ſprite with him / cō forte him and bringe his purpoſe to good effecte) one Williā Roye a man ſomewhat craftye when he cometh vnto new accoyntaunce and before he be thorow knowen and namely whē all is ſpēt / came vnto me ād offered his helpe. As longe as he had no money / ſomwhat I could ruele hī. but as ſone as he had goten him money / he became lyke him ſelfe

agayne. Nevertheleſſe I ſuffered all thinges fill y• was ēded which I coulde nor doo alone without one both to write & to helpeme to cō
               pare y• textes together. Whē that was ended I toke my leve ād bode him farewell for oure two lyves / ād as mē ſaye a daye lōger. After we were departed he went / and gate hym new frēdes which thinge to doo he paſſeth all that ever I yet knewe. And there when he had ſtored him of money he gote him to Argentine where he profeſſeth wonderfull faculties and maketh boſt of no ſmall thinges. A yere after that and now .xij. monethes before the printinge of this worke / came one Ierō a brother of Grenewich alſo / thorow wormes to Argētine / ſaienge that he entended to be Chriſtes diſciple a nother while ād to kepe (as nye as God wolde geve him grace) the profeſſion of his baptim / and to gett his lyvinge with his handes / and to live no lenger ydely and of the ſwete ād laboure of thoſe captives which they had taught / not to beleve in Chriſt: but in cutt ſhowes and ruſſet coetes. Which Ierom wyth all diligence I warned of Royes boldneſſe ād exhorted him to bewarre of him and to walke quyetly and with all pacience and longe ſofferinge acordinge as we have Chriſte & his Apoſtles for an ēſample / which thinge he alſo promiſed me. Nevertheleſſe

when he was comen to Argentine william Roye (whos tōge is able not only to make foles ſterke madde / but alſo to diſceave the wiſeſt that is at the fyrſt ſight ād accoyntaunce) gate him to him and ſert him a werke to make times / while he him ſelfe tranſlated a dialoge out of laten in to engliſch / in whoſe prologe he promyſeth moare a greate deall than I fere me he will ever paye. Paul ſaith the ſecō

Iff god at any time will geve them repentaunce for to know the throuth. It becometh not then the lordes ſervante to vſe raylinge rymes / but Gods wordes which is the right wepon to ſlaye ſinne / vice and all iniquite. The ſcripture of God is good to teach and to improve. ij. Thim. iij. and .ij. Theſ. ij. Paul ſpeakinge of Antichriſte ſaieth / whom the lorde ſhall deſtroye with the ſprite or breth of his mouth that is / with the worde of God. And .ij. Corinthians .x. The wepons of oure warre are not Carnall thinges (ſayth he) but mightye in God to caſt downe ſtronge holdes and ſo forth / that is / to deſtroye hye byldinges of falſe doctrine. The worde of God is yt daie wher of

Paul ſpeaketh .j. Corint. iij.) which ſhall declare all thinge / ād that fyre which ſhall trye every mans werke and conſume falſe doctrine: with that ſwerde ought mē ſharply to fyght / and not to rayle with foliſhe rymes. Let it not offende the that ſome walke inordinatly let not the wickednes of Iudas cauſe the to deſpice the doctrine of his fellows. No man ought to thinke that Steven was a fals preacher be cauſe that Nicolas which was choſen felowe with him (Act. vj.) to miniſtre vnto the widowes fell after ī to great hereſies as hiſtoryes make mencion. Good and evell goo alwayes to geder / one can not be knowē with out the other. Marke this alſo above althinges that Antichriſt is not an outwarde thīge that is to ſaye aman that ſhuld ſodenli appere with wonders as our fathers talked of him. No verily for Antichriſte is a ſpirituall thīge And is as moch to ſay as agaynft Chriſt / that is one that preaches falſe doctrine cōtrarye to Chriſt. Antichriſt was in the old Teſtamē
               te and fought with the Prophets / he was alſo in the ryme of Chriſt and of the Apoſtles as thou readiſt in the Piſtles of John ād of Paule to the Corinthiās and Galathians / and other Piſtles. Antichriſt is now ād ſhall (I dout not) endure till the worldes ende. But his nature is (when he is vttered ād overcome with

the worde of god) to go out of the Playe for a ſeaſon and to diſgyſe him ſelfe and then to come in agayne with a new name and new raymente. As thou ſeiſt how Chriſt rebuketh the ſcribes and the Phariſes in the Goſpell (which were very Antichriſtes) ſayīge wo be to you phariſes for ye robbe widowes houſes ye praye lōge prayers ūder a coloure / ye ſheet vp the kīgdome of hevē and ſofre not thē that woold to enter in / ye have take awaye the fay of knowleage / ye make mē breake gods commaundementes with your tradicions / ye begyle the people with ypocreſy and ſuch lyke. Which thīges all oure prelates doo: but have yet gotē them newe names and other garmentes / and are other wiſe diſgiſed / Ther is differēce in the names betwene a pope / a Cardinall / a Biſſhope / and ſo forth / and to ſay a ſcribe / a phariſey / a ſeniour and ſo forth: but the thinge is all one. Even ſo now when we have vttered hym / he will chāge hym ſelfe ones moare ād turne hym ſelfe in to an angell of light .ij. Corinth. xi. Reade the place I exhorte the / what ſo ever thou art that readeſt this ād note it well. The Jewes loke for Chriſte ād he ys come fyftyne hundred yeres a goo and they not ware: we alſo have loked for Antychriſte ond he hath regned as longe and we not ware: and that becauſe eyther of vs loked

carnally for him and not in the places where we ought to have ſought. The Jewes had founde Chriſt verely if they had ſought hī in the lawe and the prophetes / whither Chriſte ſendeth thē to ſeke. Jhohn .v. We alſo had ſpied oure Antichriſte lōge a goo if we had loked in the doctriue of Chriſte ād his Apoſtles / where be cauſe the beeſt ſeeth hī ſelfe now to be ſought for / he roereth & ſeketh new holys to hide him ſelfe in & chaungeth hī ſelfe in to a thowſande fafcionis with a

If Chriſt & they may not raygne together / one hope we have that Chriſte ſhal live ever. The olde Antichriſtes brought Chriſte vnto Pilate ſeinge / by onr lawe he ought to die / and when Pilate bade thē Judge him after there lawe they anſwarad it is not lawfull for vs to kyll any man which they did to the entente that they which regarded not the ſhame of there falſe excōmunications / ſhuld yet fere to confeſſe Chriſte becauſe that the tēpo

ſaint Paul Gal. iiij.) They wolde devide you from Chriſte ād his holy teſtamēte / and ioine you to the pope to beleve in his teſtamēte and promiſſes. Some man wil aſke parauenture why Itake the laboure to make this worke in as moch as they will brūne it ſeinge they brūt the Goſpel I anſware in brunninge the new teſtamente they did none other thinge thē that I loked for / no more ſhal they doo if the brunne me alſo if it be gods will it ſhall ſo be. Nevertheleſſe in tranſlatinge the new teſtamente I did my durye / and ſo doo I now / and will doo as moch more as god hath ordened me to doo. And as I offered that to all mē to correcte it / who ſo ever coulde even ſo doo I this Who ſo ever therfore readeſt thys / cōpare it vnto the ſcripture. If gods worde beare recorde vnto it and thou alſo feleſt in thine herte that it is ſo be of good comfort and geve god thankes. Iff gods worde condemne it / then hold it a curſrd / and ſo do all other doctrines As Paul counſeleth his galathiens. Beleve not every ſprite ſodenly / but iudge them by the worde of god which is the triall of all doctrine and laſteth for ever Amen.
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶ The parable of the wicked mammon.
            
               THere was a certayne rich mā / which had a ſtewarde that was acuſed vnto him that he had waſted his goodes And he called him and ſayd vnto hym. Howe is it that I heare this of the? Geve a cō

            Thē called he all his maſters detters / and ſaid vnto the fyrſt / howe moche oweſt thou vnto my maſter? And he ſaid / an hondred tonnes of

oyle / and he ſayd to him. take thy bill / and ſitt doune quickly / ād write fiftie. Then ſayd he to another / what oweſt thou? And he ſayde. an hondred quarters of wheate. He ſayd to him. Take thy bill / ād write foure ſcoore. And the lorde cōmē

And I ſaie alſo ūto you / make you frendes of the wicked māmon / that when ye ſhall have nede / they may receave you into everlaſtinge habitacions. Luke xvj. Chapter.
            Foras moch as with this and divers ſoch other textes / many have ēforſed to drawe the people from the true fayth and from puttinge their / truft in the trueth of Goddes promyſes and in the merites and deſervinge of his Chriſte oure lordes and have alſo brought it to paſſe (for many falſe prophetes ſhall aryſe and deceave many and moch wekednes muſt alſo be / ſaith Chriſte Mat. xxiiij. And Paul ſaith ij. Timoth. iij. Evell men and deceavers ſhall

preuayle in evell while they deceave ād are deceaved them ſelves) and have taughte them to put there truſte in their owen merites and brought them in belefe that they ſhal be inſtified in the ſight of god by the goodneſſe of there own workes and have corrupte the pure worde of god to confirme their Ariſtotell with all. For though that the philoſophers ād wordly wiſe mē were enemies above all enemies to the goſpell of God / and though the wordly wiſdome can not comprehēde the wiſdome of god as thou mayſt ſee .j.

               THat fayth only before allwerfes and whith out all merites / but Chriſtes ōly iuſtifieth & ſettith vs at peace with god ys provid by Paule in the firſt chapter to the Ro. I Am not aſhamed (ſaith he) of the goſpell / that is to ſaie / of the glad tithīges & promiſes which god hath made & ſworne to vs in Chriſt. For it (that is to ſaye the goſpell) ys the power of god vnto ſalvacyon / to all that beleve. And it foloweth in the forſaid chapter / the Juſt or rightewes muſt live by faith. ¶ For in the faith which we have ī Chriſt ād in godes promiſes finde we mercye / lyfe / favoure / ād peace. In the law we find deth / dā
                  natiō / & wrath: more over the curſe & vēgeaunce of god apō vs. And it (that is to ſaye the lawe) ys called of Paule .ij. Cor. iij. the miniſtra ciō of deth ād damnaciō. In the lawe we are proovid to be the enimies of god / and that we hate him. For how can we be at peace with god and love him / ſeinge we are conceaved and borne vnder the power of the devill ād are his poſſeſſion and kingdome / his captives and bondmē / ād leade at his will / and he holdith oure hertis / ſo that it is īpoſſible for vs to conſent to the will of god / moch more is it impoſſible for a man to fufill the lawe / of his awne ſtrnegth and power ſeynge that we

are by byrth and of nature the heires of eternall damnacyon. As ſayth Paule Ephe. ij. We (ſaith he) are by nature the chylder of waath. Which thīg the lawe doth but vtter only and helpyth vs not / yee requiryth impoſſyble thinges of vs. The law whē it cōmaundeth that thou ſhalt not luſt / geveth the not power ſo to do / but dānenith the / becauſe thou canſt not ſo doo.
            
            
               IFF thou wylt therfore be at peace with God and love him / thou muſte turne to the promyſes of God and to the Goſpel which is called of Paul in the place before reherſed to the Corinthiās / the myniſtracion of ryghtweſnes and of the ſpyryte. For fayth bryngeth pardō ād forgyvenes frely purchaſed by Chriſtes bloud ād brīgeth alſo the ſpryte / the ſpryte loeſeth the bondes of the devyll ād ſetteth vs at lybertye. For where the ſpryte of the lorde is there is libertie ſaith Paul ī the ſame place to the Corinhtiās / that is to ſaye / there the hert is fre ād hath power to love the wyl of God / and there the hert morneth that he cā not love ynough. Now is that cōſent of the hert vnto the law of God eternall lyfe / yee though there be no power yet in the mēbres to ſulfyll it. Lat every mā therfore (according to Pauls coūcell ī the .vj. ch. to the epheſ.) are me himſelfe with the armoure of God / that is

               Se therfore thou have Godes promyſes in thyne herte and that thou beleve thē wyth out waveringe: and when rētacyon arriſeth / and the devyll layeth the lawe ād thi deades agaynſt the / anſware him wyth the promyſes ād turne to God and confeſſe thy ſelfe to hym and ſay it is even ſo / or elſe how coude he be mercyfull? but remēbre that he is the God of mercye ād of truth and cā not but fulfyll hys promyſes. Alſo remembre that hys ſonnes bloud is ſtronger thē all the ſynnes and wyefydnes of the whole worlde and there wyth quiet thy ſelfe and there vnto commit thi ſelfe and bleſſe thi ſelf in all temtatyon (nameli at the houre of death) with that holy candle. Oelſe periſhiſt thou though thou haſt a thouſande holy candles aboute the / a hundred ton of holy water / a ſhipfull of pardones / a cloth ſack full of freres coetes and all the ceremonyes in the world and all the good workes / de ſervynges and merytes of all the men in the world / be they or were they never ſo holy. Godes word only laſteth for ever and that

which he hath ſworne doth abide / when all other thinges periſhe. So lōge as thou findiſt ani cōſent in thine hert vnto ye lawe of God / yt it is righteous and Good / & alſo diſpleaſure yt thou canſt not fulfill it / deſpere not / nether doute / but yt Godes ſprite is in ye / ād yt thou art choſen for Chriſtes ſake / to the enherytaunce of eternall life.
               And again Ro. iij. We ſuppoſe yt amā is iuſtified thorow faith with out ye deades of ye lawe. And like wiſe Ro. iiij. we ſaie yt faith was rekened to Abrahā for rightweſnes. Itē Ro. v. ſeing yt we ar iuſtified thorowe faith / we are at peace with God. Itē Ro. x. With ye hert doth a mā beleve / to be made righteous. Item Galat. iij. Receavid ye ye ſpirite by ye deades of ye lawe or by hearīge of ye faithe? Doth he wihich miniſtreth ye ſprite vnto you and worketh miracles amonge you / do it of the deades of the law or by heringe of fayth? Even as Abraham beleved God and it was rekened hym for righteouſnes. Vnderſtande therfore (ſaith he) that the chyldern of fayth are the chyldern of Abraham. For the ſcripture ſawe before / that God wold iuſtifye the hethen or gentyls by fayth and ſhewed before Glatydinges vnto Abrahā / in thy ſede ſhall all naciōs be bleſſed. Wherfore they which are of fayth are bleſſed / yt is to were made rightewes

with righteous Hbrahā For as māy as are of the deades of the lawe are vnder curſe. For it is writtē / ſayth he curſed is every man that cōtynueth not in all thīges which are writtē in the boke of the lawe to fulfyll them.
               Itē Gala. ij. where he reſyſted peter in the face he ſayth. We which ar Jewes by naciō ād not ſynners of the gētyls / knowe that a mā is not iuſtyfyed by the deades of the lawe / but by the fayth of Jeſus Chriſt and have therefor beleved on Jeſus Chriſte / that we might be Juſtified by the faith of Chriſt / ād not by the deades of the lawe: for by the deades of the lawe: ſhall no fleſh be iuſtyfyed. Itē in the ſame place he ſayth / twichīg that I now lyve I lyve in the fayth of the ſonne of God / which loved me and gave him ſelfe for me I deſpice not the grace of God. For if righteouſnes come by the lawe / thē is Chriſt deade in vayne. And of ſoch like enſamples are all the epiſtles of Paull full. Marke howe Paull laborith with hīſelfe to expreſſe the exceadīge miſteryes of faith in the epiſtle to the epheſiās / and in the epyſtle to the Colloſſyans. Off thes and many ſoch like textes are we ſure that the forgivenes of ſynnes and iuſtyfyinge ys appropriate vnto fayth only wythout the addinge to of workes.
               Take for the alſo the ſicknes that Chriſt ma▪
                  
keth Mathei. vij. A good tree bringeth forth good frute. And a bad tree bringeth forth bad frute. There ſeiſt thou that the frute maketh not the tree good / but the tree the frute / and that the tree muſt afore hand be good or be made good: yer it can bringe forth good frute As he alſo ſayth Math. xij. ether make the tree good and hys frute good alſo / ether make the tree bad and his frute bad alſo. How can ye ſpeake well while ye youre ſelfes ar evill? So lyke wiſe ys this true and no thing more true / that a man before all good workes muſt fyrſt be good / & that it is impoſſible that workes ſhuld make hym good / if he were not good before / yer he did good workes. For this ys Chriſtes prīciple & (as we ſay) a generall rule. How can ye ſpeake well / while ye are evyll? ſo like wiſe how cā ye doe good / while ye are evil.
               This is therfore a playne / & a ſure cōcluſion not to be dowred of / that there muſt be fyrſt in the hert of a mā before he doe any good worke / a gretter & a preciouſer thīg thē all y• good workes in y• world to recōſile hī to God to brī

Or elſe how cā he worke any good werke that ſhuld pleaſe God / if there were not ſome ſupernaturall goodnes in hī givē of god frely where of ye good worke muſt ſprīg? evē as a ſick man muſt firſt be healed or made whole / ye

               That preciouſe thinge which muſt be in the herte yer a mā cā worke any good worke is the word of god / which in y• goſpel praecheth profereth & brīgeth vnto all that repēt & beleve / the favoure of God in Chriſt. Who ſo ever herith the word and belevith it / the ſame is there by righteouſe and there by is geven hym the ſprite of God / which leadith hym vnto all that is the wylll of God and is looſed from the captyvyte and bondage of the devyll / and hys hert is free to love God / and hath luſt to doe the will of God. Therefore it is called the worde of lyſe / the word of grace / the worde of health / y• worde of redēciō / the word of forgevenes / & ye worde of peace / he yt hereth it not or belevith it not / can by no meanes be made rightous before god.

               IFF it be ſaid that Paul (whē he ſaith in the .iij. to the Romains / no fleſh ſhalbe or canbe iuſtyfied bi the deades of the law) meaneth it of the ceremonies or ſacrifices / it is a lye verilye. For it foloweth immediatly / by the lawe cōmeth the knowleage of ſinne. Now are they not the ceremonies that vtture ſinne / but the lawe of cōmandemētes. In the .iiij.

Therfore is it mighty in operatiō / full of vertue and ever workinge / which alſo renueth a man and begettith him a freſhe / alterith him chaungeth him / and turneth him all togedre in to a new nature and converſacion: ſo that a man feareth his hert all togedre altered and chaunged & ferre oderwiſe deſpoſed thē before / and hath power to love that which before he could not but hate / & deliteth ī that which before he abhorred / ād hateth that which before he coulde not but love. And it ſetteth the ſoule at libertie and maketh hyr free to folowe the will of god / and doth to the ſoule even as health doth vnto the bodie / after that a man is pined and waſted a waye with a lōge ſoekinge diſeaſe. The legges can not beare hym / he can not lift op his hādes to helpe him ſelf / his taſt is corrupte / ſuger is bitter in his mouth / his ſtomake abhorrith longinge after ſibberſauſe and ſhaſhe / at which a whole ſtomake ys ready to caſt his gorge. Whē health commith / ſhe chaūgeth & altereth hym cleane / 

gevith hym ſtrength in all hys membres and luſt to doe of hys owne accorde that which before he could not doe neder could ſuffer that any man exhorted hym to doe / and hath now luſt in holſome thinges / and his mēbres ar fre and at libertie and have power to doe of ther owne accorde all thinges which belōge to an whole mā to doe / which afore they had no power to doo / but were in captivitie & bondage So like wiſe in all thīge doth right faith to the ſoule.

which he before hated / ād hateth that which he before loued / ād is cleane altered ād chaunged and contrarie deſpoſed / and is knyt and coupled faſt to Gods wyll / and naturally bringeth forth good workes / that is to ſay / that which God commaundeth to doo / and not thinges of his owne ymagynacyon. And that doth he of hys owne accorde as a tree bringeth forth frute of hyr owne accorde. And as thou neadiſt not to byd a tree to bringe forth fruyte / ſo is ther no lawe put vnto hī that beleveth & is iuſtified thorou faith (as ſaith Paule ī y• fyrſt piſtle to Timothe the fyrſt Chapter) Nether is it neadfull. For the lawe of God is written and graved in his herte / 
                     •
                  o his pleaſure is therein. And as wyth out commaundement but even of his owne nature / he eateth drinketh / ſeeth / hereth / talketh / and goeth: even ſo of hys owne nature / wyth out coaccion or compulſyon of the lawe / bryngeth he forth good workes. And as a whole man when he is a thurſt / taryeth but for drinke / ād when he hongreth abideth but for meate / and then drinketh and eateth naturally: even ſo ys the faythfull ever a thurſt and an hongred after the wyll of God / and taryeth but for occaſyon. And when ſo ever an occaſyon is geven / he worketh naturally the wyll of God. For thys bleſſinge ys geven to all them that

truſt in Chriſtes bloude / that they thruſt and hongre to doo Gods wyll. He that hath not thys fayth / ys but an vnprofytable babler of fayth and workes / and wotteth nother what he bableth nor what he meaneth or where vnto hys wordes pertayne. For he fealeth not the power of fayth nor the workynge of the ſpirite in his herte / but enterpreteth the ſcriptures which ſpeake of fayth and workes / after his owne blynd reaſon and folyſh phantaſies and not of any fealinge that he hath in hys herte: as a man reherſeth a tale of an other manes mouth ād wotteth not wether it be ſoe or noe as he ſayth / nor hath any experyence of the thinge ſelfe. Now doth the ſcripture aſcrybe both fayth and workes not to vs / but to god only / to whom they belonge only / and to whō they are appropiate / whoſe gyft they are and the proper worke of his ſpirite.
               Is yt not a froward and perverſe blindnes? they reach how a man can do nothinge of hys owne ſelfe / and yet preſumtuouſly take apon them the greatyſt and hyeſt worke of God / even to make fayth in them ſelfes of theyr owne power and of ther owne falſe ymaginacion and thoughtes. Therfore I ſaye / we muſte deſpere of our ſelfes / ād pray God (as Chriſtes Apoſtels dyd) to geve vs fayth / ād to encreaſe our fayth. When

we have that / we neade no other thinge moare. For ſhe bringeth the ſpirite with her / & he not only teacheth vs all thinges / but workes thē alſo mightly in vs and carieth vs thorou aduerſite / perſecutiō / deeth and hell / vnto heven and everlaſtinge life.
            
            
               MArke diligently therfore ſeinge we are come to āſware. The ſcripture becauſe of ſoch dreamers ād fained faithes ſake / vſeth ſoch maner of ſpeakinges of werkes / not that a man ſhuld thereby be made good to Godwarde or iuſtified / but to declare vnto other / and to take of other the differē
                  ce betwene falſe fained faith and right faith. For where right faith ys / there bringeth ſhe forth good workes / yf ther folowe not good workes / it is no doute but a dreame & an opinion or fained faith.
               Where fore loke as the frute maketh not the tree good / but declarith ād teſtifieth outewardly that the tree is good (as Chriſt ſaith) every tree ys knowē by his frute: evē ſo ſhall ye knowe the right faith by hir frute.
               Take for an enſample mary that annoynted Chriſtes feete / Luke .vij. Whē Simō which bade Chriſte to his houſe had condemned hir / Chriſt defended hir and iuſtified hir ſainge: Simō I have a certaine thinge to ſay vnto the. And he ſaid maſter ſaie on. There was

a certayne lender which had two detters / the one oug
                     •
                  te five hundret penſe / and the other fiftie. When they had nothinge to paie he for gave bothe. Which of them tell me / will love him moſt? Simon anſwered & ſaid: I ſuppoſe that he to whom he forgave moſt. And he ſaid to him / thou haſt truly iudged. And he turned him to the woman / & ſaid vnto Simō Seiſt thou this woman? I entred in to thine howſe / and thou gaveſt me no water to my feete / but ſhe hath weſhed my feete with teares / & wipte them with the heeres of hir heed Thou gaveſt me no kiſſe / but ſheſens the time I came in / hath not ceaſed to kiſſe my feete. My heed with oyle (which is but a vile thīg) thou haſt not annoynted. And ſhe hath annoynted my feete with coſtlie & preciouſe oyntement. Wherefore I ſay vnto the / many ſinnes ar forgeven her for ſhe loveth moch. To whom leſſe is forgeven / the ſame doth love leſſe &c. Hereby ſe we that deades and workes are but outward ſignes of the inwarde grace of the bounteous and plenteous mercy of god frely receaved / with out all merites of deades / yee ād before all deades. Chriſt teacheth to knowe the inwarde fayth and love / by the outwarde deades. Deades are the frutes of love / and love ys the frute of faith. Love and alſo the deades are great or ſmall accordinge

to the proporciō of fayth. Where fayth is mighty & ſtrong there is love fervent ād deades plentuouſe and done with excedinge mekenes Where fayth is weake / theris love colde and the deades fewe and fadith as flowres & bloſomes in winter. Simon beleved ād had fayth / yet but weaklie / ād according to the proporcyon of his fayth loved coldlye / ād had deades therafter: he bade Chriſte vnto a ſimple and a bare feeſt only / and receaued hī not with ony great humanite. But Mari had a ſtronge fayth / and therfore burninge love / and notable deades done with exceadinge profounde and deape mekenes. On the on ſyde ſheſawe her ſelfe clerely in the lawe / both in what daunger ſhe was in / and her cruell bondage vnder ſinne / hyr horryble damnacyon and alſo the fearfull ſentence and iudgement of God apon ſynners. On the oderſyde ſhe herd the goſpell of Chriſt preached / and in the promyſſes ſhe ſawe wyth egles eyes the exceadinge abundaunt mercye of God / that paſſeth all vtteraunce of ſpeach / which is ſet forth in Chriſt for all meke ſynners. Which knowleage ther ſynnes. And ſhe beleved the word of God myghtylye and glorifyed God over his mercye and truth / and being overcome and overwhelmed with the vnſpeakeable yee and incomprehenſyble aboundante ryches of

the kyndnes of God / dyd enflame and burne in love / yee was ſo ſwolne in love / that ſhe cowld not abyde nor hold / but muſt breake out / and was ſo dronke in love that ſhe regarded no thinge / but evyn to vtter the fervent and burnynge love of hyr hert only. She h

Even as Paule ī the neynth Chapter of his pyſtle to the Romyans was dronke in love and overwhelmed wyth the plentuouſnes of the infinyte mercye of god (which he had receaved in Chryſte vnſought fore) wyſhed hym ſelf baneſhy
                     •
                   from Chriſte and damned / to ſave the Iewes / if it myght have bene. For as a man fealeth God in hym ſelfe / ſo ys he to hys neghboure.
               
                  Marke an oderihinge alſo. We for the moſt part becauſe of our groſſenes / in all oure knouwleage proceade from that which is laſt and hinmoſt vnto that which is firſt / beginninge at the later ende / diſputinge ād making our argumentes backwarde. We beginne at the effecte and worke and procede vnto the naturall cauſe. As becauſe of an enſample we firſt ſe the mone derke / ād then ſherch the cauſe / ād find that the puttinge of therth betwene the ſone ād the mone is the naturall cauſe of the darknes and that the erth ſtoppeth the light. Thē diſpute we backewarde ſayinge: the mone is darknede / therfore is the erth directli betwene the ſone & the mone. Now yet is not the derknes of the mone the natural cauſe that therth is betwene the ſone and the mone / but the effecte therof and cauſe declarative / declarīge and leadinge vs vnto the knowleage / how that the erth ys betwene the ſone and the mone directlye ād cauſeth the derknes / ſtopping the light of the ſonne frō the mone. And cōtrar
                     •
                  e wiſe the beinge of the erthe directelye betwene the ſone and the mone is the naturall cauſe of the derknes. Lyfe wiſe he hath a ſone therfore is he a father / and yet the ſone is not cauſe of the father / but contrarie wiſe. Not with ſtondinge the ſonne is the cauſe declarative / where bye we knowe that

the other ys a father. After the ſame maner here / many ſynnes ar forgeven her / for ſhe lovethe moch / thou mayſt not onderſtand by the worde for / that love is the naturall cauſe of the forgeuinge of ſynnes / but declareth it onli / and contrary wiſe the forgevenes of ſynes ys the naturall cauſe of love.
               ¶ The workes declare love. And love declareth that ther is ſome benefite & kīdnes ſhewed or els wold ther be no love. Whi worketh one and an other not? Or one more then an other? Becauſe that one lovyth and the other not / or that the one loveth more then thother. Whilovyth one and an other not / or one more then an other? Bycauſe that one fealeth the excedinge kyndnes of god in hys herte and an other not / or that on fealeth it more than an other. Scripture ſpaeketh after the moſt groſſeſt maner. Be dilygent therfore that thou be not deceaved wyth curyouſnes. For men of no ſmall reputacyon have bene dceeaved wyth ther owne ſophiſtrye.
            
            
               HEreby nowe ſeiſt thou / that ther is great difference betwene beinge righteous & good in a mās ſelf / & declarīge and vtterīge righteouſnes and goodnes. The faith ōly maketh a mā ſafe / good / righteouſe and the frēd of god / yee and the ſonne and the heire of God and of all hys goodnes and poſſeſſeth

vs wyth the ſpyryte of God. The worke declareth the ſelf fayth & goodnes. Now vſeth the ſcripture the cōmune māner of fpeatinge / and the very ſame that is amonge the people. As whē a father ſayth to hys chyld / go ād be loving mercyfull and good / to ſoch or ſoch a pore man / he byddyth hym not / there with to be made mercyful / fynd and good: but to teſtyfye and declare the goodnes that is ī hym all redie wyth the outward deade: that it maye breake out to the profet of other / and that other maye fele it which have neade ther of.
               After the ſame maner ſhalt thou enterprete the ſcriptures which make mencyon of workes: that God therby wyll that we ſhewe forth that goodnes which we have receaved by fayth / and let it breake forth and come to the profet of other that the falſe fayth may be knowen and weded oute by the roetes. For God geveth no man hys grace / that he ſhuld let it lye ſtyll and doe noo good wyth all: but that he ſhuld encreace it and multyplye it wyth lendinge it to other / and wyth opynly declaringe of it wyth the outward workes / provoke and drawe other to God / As Chriſt ſayth in Mathew the fyft Chapter let youre lyght ſo ſhyne in the ſyght of men that they maye ſe youre good workes / and gloryfye your father which is in heven. Or els were it as a treaſure

dygged in the ground and hyd wyſdome / in which what profett is ther?
               More over ther wyth the goodnes / favour / and gyſtes of God which are in the / not only ſhalbe knowen vnto other / but alſo vnto ▪thyne awne ſelf / and thou ſhalbe ſure that thy fayth is right / and that the true ſpyryte of God is in the / and that thou art called and choſen of God vnto eternall lyfe / and looſed from the bondes of Sathan whos captyve thou waſt / as Peter exhorteth in the fyrſt of hys ſeconde epyſtle / thorow good workes to make oure callinge and elecetyon (where wyth we
                     •
                  ar called and choſen of God) ſure. For how dare a man preſume to thynke / that hys fayth is right / and that Godes favoure is on hym / and that Godes ſpryte is in hym (when he fealeth not the workynge of the ſpyryte / nether hym ſelf deſpoſed to any godly thinge. Thou canſt never knowe or be ſure of thy fayth / but by the workes / yf workes folowe not yee and that of love / with out lokinge / after any rewarde / thou maiſt be ſure that thy faith is but a dreame and not right / and even the ſame that James called ī his piſtel the .ij. Chapter deed fayth and not iuſtifienge.
               Abrahā thorow workes Geneſis .xxij. was ſure of hys fayth to be ryght / and that the true feare of God was in hym / when he had off

ered hys ſonne (as the ſcripture ſaith) Now knowe I that thou feareſt god / y• is to ſaie Now is it open & manyfeſt that thou feareſt God / in as much as thou haſt not ſpared thy only ſonne for my ſafe.
            
            
               SO now by this abyde ſure and faſt y• a man inwardly in the hert & before God is ryghteons and good thorow faith only before all werfys. Not wyth ſtandinge yet outwardly & opēly before the people / ye & before him ſelf / is he righteons throw the worke / that is / he fuowith and is ſure throw the outwarde worke that he is a true belever and in the favure of God and righteous and good thorow the mercy of God / that thou mayſt call the one an opyn ād an owtward rightweſnes / ād the other an inwarde righteouſnes of the hert (ſo yet) that thou vnderſiond by the outward righteouſnes / no oder thinge ſave the frute that foloweth / and a derclaringe of the inward Juſtyfyinge & righteouſnes of the hert / and not that it maketh a man righteous before God / but that he muſt fyrſt berighteons before him in the hert. Even as thou maiſt call y• frute of the tree / the outward goodnes of the tree which folowith & v

               This meaneth James in hys pyſtle where he ſaith / fayth wythout worfes is deed thes

ye / if workes folowe not / is a ſure and an evydent ſygne / that there is no fayth in the hert / but a deed ymagynacyon and dreame which they falſſly call fayth.
               Off the ſame wyſe ys this ſainge of Chriſt to be vnderſtande. Make you frendes of the vnrighteous mammon / that ys ſhowe youre fayth openly and what ye are within in the hert / with outwarde geving and beſtowinge youre good is on the pore / that ye maye obtayne frendes / that is / that the pore on whom thou haſt ſhewede mercy maye at the daye of Judgement teſtyfye and witneſſe of thy good workes. That thy faith & what thou waſt wythin in the hert before God maye there apre by thy frutes openly vnto all men. For vnto the right belevinge ſhall all thinges be confortable and vnto conſolacyon at that terryble daye. And contrary wyſe vnto the vnbelevinge / all thynge ſhalbe vnto deſperacyon / and confucyon / and every man ſhalbe iudged openly and outwarly in the preſens of all men / acordinge to ther deades and workes. So that not wyth oute a cauſe thou mayſt call them thy frendes / which teſtyfie at that daye of the / that thou levedſt as a true and a right Chriſten man and folowedſt the ſteppes of Chriſt in ſhewinge mercy / as no donte he doth which fealeth God mercyfull in hys

herte. And bythe workes ys the fayth knowen / that it was right ād perfect. For the outwarde workes can never pleaſe God nor make frende / except they ſpringe of fayth. For as moch as Chriſt hym ſelfe Maith. in the .vi. and .vij. Chapter dyſaloweth and caſteth awaye the workes of the phareſeys: yee propheſyenge and workinge of miracles and caſtynge out of devyls / whych we counte and eſteme for veray excellent vertues. Yet make they no frēdes with there workes / whyle ther hertes are falſe and vnpure and ther eye double. Now wyth out fayth is no herte true or eye ſyngle: ſo that we ar cōpelled to cōfeſſe that the workes make not a mā righteous or good but that the hert muſt fyrſt / be righteous and good yer any good worke procede thenſe.
            
            
               SEcōdarily all good workes muſt be done free with a ſyngle eye with out reſpecte of any thinge / and that no profet be ſought thereby.
               That commaundeth Chriſt / where he ſayth Mar. x fre have ye receaved / fre geve agayne. For loke as Chriſt with all his workes did not deſerve heven / for that was his all redye / but dyd vs ſervyce therwith / ād nether loked nor ſoughte his awne profit

                   / but our profit / & the honoure of God y• father only. Evē ſo we with all oure workes maye not ſefe oure awne profit / 

nether in this world nor in hevē / but muſt ād ought frely to worke / to honour God wyth all / and without all maner reſpecte / ſefe oure neyghbours profit and do hym ſervice. That meaneth Paul Philip. ij. ſayng. Bemynded as Chriſt was which beinge in the ſhappe of God / equall vnto God and even very God / laid that a part / that is to ſaie / hyd it. And to
                  
                     •
                  e on him the forme ād faſeyon of a ſervaunt. That is / as cōcerninge hym ſelfe he had ynough / that he was full / & had all plentuouſnes of the Godhed / ād in all his workes ſought our profit and became our ſervant.
               The cauſe is. For as moch as faith inſtifieth and putteth a waye ſynne in the ſight of God / bringeth lyfe / helth and the favoure of God / maketh vs the heyres of God / powreth the ſpryte of God in to oure ſoules and fylleth vs with all godlifulnes in Chriſt / it were to great a ſhame / rebuke and wronge vnto the faith / yee to Chriſtes bloud / iff a man wolde worke any thinge to purches that where wyth fayth hath indued him allredye / and God hath geven hym frely. Even as Chriſt had done rebuke and ſhame vnto hym ſelfe / yff he wolde have done good workes and wrought to have bī made therby Gods ſonne & heire over all / which thing he was allredie. Now doth fayth make vs the ſonnes or chyldern of God.

Johan. i. he gave them myght or power to be they ſonnes of God / ī that they beleved on his name. Iff we be ſonnes / ſo are we alſo heires Ro. viij. and Gala. iiij. How can or ought we thē to worke / for to purches that entherytaunce with all where of we are heyres all redye by fayth?
               What ſhall we ſaye then to thoſe ſcriptures which ſownde as though a mā ſhuld do good workes and lyve well for hevēs ſake or eternall rewarde? As theſe are / make you frē
                  des of the vnrighteous mammō. And Mat. vij. Gather you treaſure together in hevē. Alſo Mat. xix. If thou wilte enter in to lyfe kepe the commaundemētes and ſoch lyke. Thys ſaye I / that they which vnderſtonde nor / nether fele in ther hertes what fayth meaneth / talke and thinke of the rewarde evē as they do of the worke / nether ſuppoſe they that a man ought to worke but in a reſpecte to the rewarde. For they ymagen that it is in the kingdome of Chriſt / as it is in the worlde amonge men / that they muſt deſerve heven with there good workes. How be it there thoughtes are but dreames and falſe ymaginacions. Off theſe men ſpeaketh Malachias Chap. i. who is it amonge you that ſhutteth a doere for my pleaſure for nought? that is / with out reſpecte of rewarde. Theſe are ſervātes / that ſeke gaynes

and vauntage / hyrelinges and day labourers which here on erth receave there rewardes / as the phareſes with there prayers: and faſiīges Matth. v.
               But on this wiſe goeth it with hevē / with evirlaſting lyfe and eternall rewarde / like wiſe as good workes naturally folowe fayth (as it ys above retherſed) ſo that thou neadeſt not to cōmannde a true belever to worke or to cō
                  pell hym with any lawe / for it is vnpoſſible that he ſhuld not worke / he taryeth but for an occaſiō / he is ever deſpoſed of hym ſelfe / thou neadeſt but to put him in remembrauuce / and that to knowe the falſe fayth frō the true. Evē ſo naturally doth eternall lyfe folowe fayth and good lyvinge / without ſekingfor / and is impoſſible that it ſhulde not come / though no man thought there on. Yet ys it rether ſed in the ſcripture / alleged and promiſed to knowe the differēce betwene a fals belever ād a true belever / & that every man maye knowe what foloweth good lyuinge naturally ād of it ſelfe with out takinge
                     •
                   thought for it.
               Take a groſſe enſample. Hell that is / everlaſtinge deth is threatned vnto ſynners / and yet folowith it ſynne naturally without ſekinge for. For no mā doth evell to bedāned therfore / but had lever avoyde it. Yet there the one foloweth the other naturally / and though no

man tolde or warned hym of it / yet ſhuld the ſynner fynde it / ād feale it. Nevertheleſſe it is therfore thretened / that men maye knowe what folowyth evyll lyvinge. Now then as after evell levinge folowyth his rewarde vnſought for / even ſo after good levinge foloweth his reward naturally vnſought for or vnthought apon. Even as when thou drinkeſt wine / be it good or badde / the taſt foloweth of it ſelfe / though thou therfore drinke yt not. Yet teſtyfieth the ſcripture / and it is true / that we are by enheritance heyres of damnatyon / and that yer we be borne / we are veſſels of ye wrath of God and full of that poyſon whence naturallye all ſynnes ſpringe / and where wyth we can not but ſynne / which thinge the deades that folowe (when we be holde oure ſelves in the glaſſe of the lawe of God) do declare and vtter / kyll oure conſciences ād ſhowe vs what we were and wiſt not of it ād certyfieth vs that we are heyres of damnacyon. For iff we were of God we ſhulde cleve to God and luſt after the wyll of God. But now our deades cōpared to the lawe declare the contrarie and by our deades we ſe our ſelfes / both what we be & what our ende ſhall be
               Go now thou ſeyſt that lyfe eternall and all good thynges are promyſed vnto fayth and belefe: ſo that he that beleveth on Chriſt / 

ſhalbe ſafe. Chriſtes bloude hath purcheaſyd lyfe for vs and hath made vs the heyres of God: ſo that heven cometh by Chriſtes bloud. Iff thou woldiſt obtayne heven with the merytes and deſervinges of thyne awne workes / ſo dyddiſt thou wronge / yee and ſhamediſt the bloud of Chriſt / and vnto the were Chriſt deade in vayne. Now is the true belever heyre of God by Chriſtes deſervinges / yee and in Chriſt was predeſtynate and ordened vnto eternall lyfe / before the world began. And when the Goſpell is preached vnto vs we beleve the mercye of God / and in belevinge we receave the ſpryte of God / which is the ernyſt of eternall lyfe / and we are in eternall lyfe allready / and feale allready in oure hertes the ſwetnes therof / and are overcome wyth the kyndnes of God and Chriſt and therefore love the wyl of God / ād of love are ready to worke frely / ād not to optayne that which is gevyn vs frely ād where of we are heyres allready.
               Now when Chriſt ſayth. Make you frēdes of vrighteous mammon. Geder you treaſure together in hevē & ſoch lyke. Thou ſciſt that the meaninge and entēt is no nother / but that thou ſhuldeſt do good / and ſo wyll it folowe of it ſelfe naturally / without ſeking & takinge of thought / that thou ſhalt fynde frēdes and

treaſure in heven and receave a rewarde. So late thyne eye be ſingle / ād loke vnto good livinge only ād take no thought for the rewarde: But be contēt. For as moch as thou knowiſt ād art ſure that the rewarde & all thinge cōtayned in Gods promiſes folowe good lyvingenaturally / and thy good workes do but teſtifie only and certyfie the that the ſpryte of God is in the / whō thou haſt receaved in erneſt of Gods truth / and that thou art heyre of all the goodnes of God / & that all good thinges are thine all readye purcheaſed by Chriſtes bloude ād leid vppe in ſtoere agaynſt that daye when every man ſhall receave accordinge to his deades / that is / accordinge as hys deades declare and teſtifie / what he is or was For they that loke vnto the rewarde / are ſlowe falſe / ſuttell and crafty workers / and love the rewarde moare then the worke / yee hate the laboure / yee hate God whych commaundeth the laboure / ād are wery both of the cōmaundement and alſo of the cōmaunder / and worke wyth tediouſnes. But he that worketh of pure love wyth oute ſekinge of rewarde / worketh truly.
               Thrydly that not the Sayntes / but God only receaveth vs in to eternall tabernacles / ys ſo playne and evident / that it neadeth not to decleare or prove it. How ſhall the Sayntes

receave vs in to heven / when every man hath neade for hym ſelf / that God only receave him to heven / and every man hath ſcace for hym ſelf: As it appereth by the fyve wyſe vyrgyns Matth. xxv. which wold not geve of there oyle vnto the onwyſe vyrgyns. And Peter ſayth in the .iiij. of hys fyrſt piſtle that the righteous ys with difficultye ſaved. So ſeyſt thou that the ſayenge of Chriſt / make you frendes and ſo forth / that they may receyve you in to everlaſtinge tabernacles / pertayneth not vnto the ſayntes which are in heven / but is ſpoken of the pore ād neady which are here preſent with vs on Erihe / as though he wold ſaye. What byldyft thou churches / foundeſt Abbays / chauntryes / and colleages in the honor of ſayntes / to my Mother / ſaynt Peter / Paule ād ſayntes that be deed to make of them thy frendes? They neade it not / yee they are not thy frendes but thers. Which lyved thē when they dyd / of whom they were helpen. Thy frendes are the pore which are now in thy tyme and lyve wyth the / thy pore neybours which neade thy help and ſuccoure. Them make thy frendes wyth thy vnrighteous mammon / that they maye teſtyfye of thy fayth / and thou mayſt knowe and fele that thy fayth is right and not fayned.
            
            
               
               UNto the ſecōde / ſoche receavinge in to everlaſtinge habitaciōs is not to be vnderſtonde / that mē ſhall do it. For many to whom we ſhew mercye and doe good shall not cōme there / nether ſkylleth it / ſo we mekely ād lovingly do our dutye / yee it is a ſigne of ſtronge fayth / and fervent love / if we doe well to the evyll / and ſtudye to drawe them to Chryſt in all that lyeth in vs. But the pore geve vs an occaſyon to exercyce oure fayth / and the deades make vs feale our fayth and certyfye vs and make vs ſure that we are ſafe / and are eſcaped and tranſlated from death vnto lyfe / and that we are delyvered and redemed from the captyvyte and boundage of Saran / and brought in to the lybertye of the ſonnes of God in that we fele luſt and ſtrength in our herte / to worke the wyll of God. And at that daye ſhall our deades appere and comfort our hertes / witneſe our faith and truft which we now have in Chryſte which fayth ſhall then kepe vs from ſhame / as it ys wryttryn. None that beleveth in hym ſhalbe aſhamed Rom. ix. So that good workes helpe our fayth / ād make vs ſure in oure conſciences and make vs feale the mercy of God. Not withſtandinge heven / everlaſtinge lyfe / Joye eternall / fayth the favoure of God the ſpyryte of God luſt and ſtrength vnto

the wyll of God / are geven vs frely / of the bountoeus and plenteous riches of God purehaſede by Chriſte / with out our deſervinges / that no man ſhulde reioyſe / but in the lord only.
            
            
               FOr a forder vnderſtandinge of thys Goſpell / may here be made .iij. queſtions. What māmonis / whi it ys called vnrighteous / and after what maner Chriſt byddyth vs counterfet and folowe the vniuſt and wycked ſtuard which wyth his lordes damage provyded for his awne profit and vantage / which thing no doute is vnrighteous and ſynne.
               Fyrſt Mammon ys an Ebrewe worde and ſignifyeth riches or temporall goodes / ād namelye all ſuperfluyte / and all that ys above neceſſyte and that which is requyred vnto our neceſſarie vſes / where wyth a mā maye helpe an other / with out vndoīge or hurtīge himſelfe. For hamon in the Ebrewe ſpeach ſignifieth a multytude or abundaunce or many. And therehence cōmeth mahamō or māmon aboūdaūce or plēteouſnes of goodes or riches
               Secūdaryly / it is called vnrichteous mammon / not becauſe it ys goten vnrighteouſly or with vſury. For of vnrighteous gotē good 
                     •
                  s can no man doo good workes / but ought to reſtore them whom agayne. As it ys ſayd

Yſaias .lxj. I ā a god that hateth offerīge that cōmeth of robbery. And Galo. pro. iij. ſayth / honoure the Lorde of thine awne good. But therfore is it called vnrighteous / becauſe it is in vnrighteous vſe. As Paule ſpeaketh vnto the Epheſiās .v. how that the dayes are evill thoughe that God hath made them / and they are a good worke of Goddes makynge. How be it they are yet called evill / becauſe that evyll men vſe them amiſſe / and moche ſynne / occaſyōs of evill / perrell of ſoulis are wroughte in thē. Evē ſo is riches called evill becauſe that evill mē beſtowe it amiſſe ād miſvſe thē. For where ryches ys there goeth it after the cōmen proverbe. Be that hath money hath what him lyſteth. And they cauſe fyghtinge / ſtelinge / leynge a wayte / lyinge / flatteringe and all vnhappynes agaynſt a mās neyghboure. For all men holde on ryches parte.
               But ſingularly before God is it callled vnrighteous mammon / becauſe it is not beſtowed and myniſtred vnto oure neibours neade For if my neybour nede and I geve hym nor / nether depart lyberally with hym / of that which I have: than wythhold I frō hym vnrighteouſly that which is hys awne. For as moch as I am bownden to helpe hym by the lawe of nature / which is / what ſo ever thou woldeſt that a nother dyd to the that do thou

alſo to hym. And Chriſt Mathei. v. Geve to every man that deſireth the. And John in hys firſt pyſtle / yf a man have this worldes good and ſe hys brother neade / how is the love of God in hym? And thys vnrighteouſnes in oure mammon ſe very fewe men. Becauſe it is ſprituall / and in thoſe goodes which argoren moſt truly and iuſtlye / which begyle men. For they ſuppoſe they do no man wronge in kepinge them / in that they gott them not wyth ſtelinge / Robbinge / oppreſſiō / and vſury / nether hurt any man now wyth them.
               Thrydly many have buſyed thē ſelfes inſtudyēge what or who this vnrighteous ſteward ys / becauſe that Chriſt ſo praiſeth hym. But ſhortely ād playnely this is the anſwere. That Chriſt prayſeth not the vnrighteotus ſtuard / nether ſetteth hym forth to vs to counterfett / becauſe of hys vnrighteouſnes but becauſe of his wiſdome only in that he with vnright ſo wiſely provid
                     •
                  d for hi ſelfe As I if I wolde provoke a nother to praie or ſtudie ſaie. The the ves watche all nighte to robbe & ſtele: why cāſt not thou watche to praye & to ſtudie? Here prayſe not I the thefe and murderer for there evyll doīge / but for there wyſdome / that they ſo wiſely and diligētly waite on ther vnrighteouſnes. Like wiſe when I ſaye miſſe women tyre them ſelfes wyth gold and ſylke to pleaſe

ther lovers. What wylt not thou garnyſh thy ſoule wyth fayth to pleaſe Chriſt? here prayſe I not whordome / but the diligence which the whore myſvſeth.
               Off this wyſe Paule alſo Roma. v. likeneth Adam and Chriſt together / ſayenge that Adam was a fygure of Chriſte. And yet of Adā have we but pure ſynne / and of Chriſt grace only / which are out of meaſure contrarie. But the ſymylytude or lyknes ſtondeth in the origynall byrth / and not in the vertue and vice of the birth. So that as Adam is father of all ſynne / ſo is Chriſt father of all righteouſnes. And as all ſynners ſpringe of Adam. Euen ſo all righteous men and women ſpringe of Chriſt. After the ſame maner is here the vnrighteous ſtuarde an enſample vnto vs in hys wyſdome and dylygence only / in that he provided ſo wyſely for hym ſelfe / that we wyth righteouſnes ſhulde be as dylygente to provyde for our ſoules / as he wyth vnrighteouſnes provided for hys body.
               Lyke wyſe mayſt thou ſoyle all other textes which ſounde as though it were betwene vs and God as it is in the worlde where the rewarde ys moare loked apon / then the laboure: yee where men hate the laboure and worke falſly wyth the bodye / and not with the hert and no longer than they are loked apon / that

the laboure may appere outwarde only.

Now

is it Chriſtes bloud only that deſerved all the promiſes of God ād that which / I ſoffre & do is partly y• curinge healinge and mortyfienge of my mēbres & killinge of that originall poiſon / where with I was cōceaved & borne / yt I might be altogedre lyke Chriſt / & partly ye doinge of my durye to my neighboure / whos detter I am of all yt I have receavid of God / to drawe hī to Chriſt with all ſuffringe / with all paciēs & evē with ſhedīge my bloud for hī / not as an offeringe or merite for his ſinnes / but as an enſample to prouoke hym. Chriſtes bloude ōly putteth awaye all the ſinne yt ever was / is or ſhalbe from them that are electe and repent belevinge the Goſpell that is to ſaye gods promiſes in Chriſte.

But Chriſt ſayth to vs Mat. v. except your righteouſnes excede the righteouſnes of the ſcrybes & phariſes / ye can not enter in to the kingdome of hevē.

blindnes than for hys awne payne / and prayeth God to opē his eyes and to forgeve hym his ſynnes / as dyd Steven in the Actes of the Apoſtles the .vij. Chap. and Chriſt Luc. xxiij.
               A chriſten cōſidereth him ſelf in the lawe of God / ād there putteth of him all maner ryghteouſnes. For the lawe ſuffereth no merites no deſervinges / no ryghteouſnes / nether any mā to be iuſtifyed in the ſight of God. The lawe is ſpirituall and requireth the herte and commaundementes to be fullfillyd with ſoch love and obedience as was in Chriſte. If any fulfyll all that is the will of God with ſoch love ād obediēce / the ſame may be bold to ſell pardons of his merites / and els not.

Be faſteth alſo not one day for a weke / or a lente for an whole yeare / but profeſſeth in hys hert a perpetuall ſobyrnes / to tame the fleſh and to ſubdue the body to the ſpyryte / vntyll he wax ſtronge in the ſpyrite and growe rype in to a full ryghteouſnes after the fulnes of Chriſte. And be cauſe thys fulnes happeneth not tyll the body be ſlayne by deeth / a Chriſtē ys ever a ſynner in the lawe / and therfore faſteth and prayeth to God in the ſpyryte / the world ſeinge it not. Yet in the promyſes he ys ever righteous / thorow fayth in Chriſte ād ys ſure that he ys heyre of all goddes promyſes / the ſpryte which he hath receaved in erneſt / bering hym wittenes / his herte alſo ād his deades teſtifyenge the ſame.

The entēt of the ſimilitude is to ſhowe to whom a man is a neighboure or who is a mans neyghboure (which is both one) ād what it is to love a mās neyghboure as hym ſelfe. The Samaritane holpe him and ſhewed mercy as lōge as he was preſent / ād when he cowld be no lenger preſent / he left his monye behinde him. And if that were not ſufficient / he left his credēs to make good the reſt / ād forſoke him not / as longe as the other had neade Then ſaid Chriſt go thou and do like wiſe / that is / without difference or reſpection of perſons who ſo ever neadeth thy helpe / him count thy neighboure / ād his neyboure be thou ād ſhewe merci on hī as lōge as he neadeth thy ſoccoure / and that is to love a mans neyboure as him ſelfe. Neyghboure is a worde of love and ſignefieth that a man ſhuld be ever nye and at hand and readie to helpe in time of neade.

But vnfrutefull diſputynge & braulinge abowt wordes.

as the wordes ſounde. Rede the ſeconde Chapter of Paule to the Corinthians / the naturall man vnderſtondeth not the thinges of God / but ye ſprite of god only and we (ſayeth he) have receaved the ſprite which is of God / to vnderſtonde ye thinges which ar gevē vs of god. For without the ſprite it is īpoſſible to vnderſtonde thē. Rede alſo the .viij. to the Romayns They that are leed with the ſprite of God / are the ſonnes of God. Now the ſonne knoweth his fathers will & the ſervāt not he that hath not the ſprite of Chriſte (ſayeth Paule) is none of his. Likewiſe he that hath not the ſprite of God is none of Gods / for it is bothe one ſprite / as thou mayſt ſe in the ſame place.
               Now he that is of God / hereth the worde of God Jo. viij. and who is of God but he that hath the ſprite of God. Forther more / ſayeth he ye heare it not / becauſe ye ar not of God / that is / ye have no luſt in the worde of God / for ye vnderſtōd it not / ād that becauſe his ſprite is not in you.
               For as moch then as the ſcripture is no thige els but that which ye ſprite of God hath ſpokē bithe Prophetes & Apoſtles / ād can not be vnderſtāde but of the ſame ſprite: Let every mā pray to God to ſend hym his ſprite to looſe vs frō our naturall blindnes ād ignorāce / and to geve vs vnderſtonding ād fealinge of y• thinges

of God and of the ſpeakinge of the ſprite of God. And marke this proceſſe. Firſt we ar dā

And as thou ſeyſt a yōg chyld / which hath playſure in many thinges where in is preſent deeth / as io fire / water ād ſo forth / wold ſlee hym ſelfe with a thowſande dethes / if he were not wayted apon ād kept therfro. Evē ſo we / if we ſhuld lyve this thouſande yeres could in all that time delite in no other thinge nor yet ſeke any other thing / but that where in is deeth of the ſoule.
               Secūdarily of the hole multitude of the nature of mā / whō God hath electe ād choſen ād to whō he hath apointed mercy & grace in Chriſt / to thē ſendeth he his ſprite / which openeth ther eyes / ſhoweth thē ther miſerye / & brīgeth thē vnto the knowleage of them ſelves / ſo that they hate ād abhorre thē ſelves / are a ſtonyed ād amaſed ād at ther wittes ēdes / nether wott what to do or where to ſeke helth. Thē leſt they ſhuld flee frō God bi deſperacion / he cōforteth thē agayne with his ſwete promiſes in Chriſte ād certifyeth there hertes that for Chriſtes ſake they ar receaved to mercye ād ther ſinnes forgeven ād they electe & made the ſonnes of god ād heyres with Chriſte of eternall life: ād this thorowe fayth ar they ſet at peace with God.
               
                  Now maye not we axe why god choſeth one & not ā other / other thinke that God is vniuſt to damme vs afore we do any actuall deade / ſeing that God hath power over all his creatures of right / to do with them what he lyſt or to make of every one of them as he liſteth. Oure darknes cānot perceave his light. God wilbe fered and not have his ſecret iudgemē
                  tes knowen. More over we bi the light of faith ſe a thouſande thinges which are impoſſible to an infidle to ſe. So like wiſe no doute in the light of the clear viſiō of God we ſhall ſe thī
                  ges which now God wyll not have knowen. For payde ever accompanyeth hye knowleage but grace accōpanyeth mekenes. Let vs therfore gyve dylygence rather to do the wyll of God / then to ſearch hys ſecrettes which ar not profytable for vs to knowe.
               When we ar thus reconſyled to God / made the frendes of God and heyres of eternall lyfe / the ſprite that God hath powred in to vs teſtyfyeth that we may not lyve after our olde deades of ignorance. For how is it poſſyble / that we ſhulde repente and abhorre them / and yet have luſt to lyve in them. We ar ſure therfore that God hath created and made vs newe in Chriſt / and put hys ſpryte in vs that we ſhuld lyve a newe lyfe / which ys the lyfe of good workes.
               
                  That thou maiſt knowe what are good workes / or what workes are good & the ende & entēte of good workes / or wherfore good workes ſerve / marke this that foloveth.
               The lyfe of a Chriſten man ys inwarde betwene hym and God / and properly ys the conſente of the ſprite to the wyll of God / and to the honour of god. And godes honour ys the fynall ende of all good workes.
               Good workes ar all thīges yt are done wyth in the lawes of God / in which God is honoured & for which thākes are gevē to God.

               Almes is a greake worde & ſignifieth mercy One Chriſtē is detter to an other at his neade of all yt he is able to do for hī vntill' his neade be ſuffiſed. Every Chriſtē man ought to have Chriſt all ways before his eyes / as an enſample to counterfaite & folowe / & to do to his neyboure as Chriſt hath done to hī / as Paulteacheth in all his piſtles ād Peter in his fyrſt & John in his firſt alſo. This order vſeth Paule in all his piſtles. Firſt he preacheth ye lawe ād proveth yt the whole nature of mā is damnyd in that y• hert luſteth cōtrary to y• will of God.

Which they that beleve & take it for an erneſt thynge / turne thē ſelves to God / beginne to love God agayne / & to prepare thē ſelves to his wyll by y• working of the ſprite of God in thē. Laſt of all exorteth he to vnite / peace ād ſobernes / to avoyde beaulīges / ſectes / opiniōs / diſputinge ād arguinge abowt wordes / ād to walke ī the playne ād ſyngle fayth ād fealinge of y• ſprite / & to love one an other after y• ēſample of Chriſt / even as Chriſt loved vs & to be thākfull / & to walke worthy of y• Goſpell ād as it becometh Chriſt and with the enſample of pure living to drawe all to Chriſte.
               Chriſt is lorde over all / & every criſtē is heyre ānexed with Chriſt ād therfore lorde of all / ād every one lorde of what ſo ever an other hath. Yf thy brother on neiboure therfore neade and thou have to helpe hī ād yet ſhoweſt not mercy but with draweſt thy hādes frō hī: thē robbeſt thou hī of his owne ād art a theſe. A Chriſten mā hath Chriſtes ſprite. Now is Chriſt a mercifull thinge: if therefore thou be not mercyfull after ye ēſample of Chriſte thē haſt thou not his ſprite. Yf thou have not Chriſtes ſprite / then art thou none of his Ro. viij. nor haſt any parte with hī. More over though thou ſhewe mercye vnto thy neibour / yet if thou do it not with ſoch burnīg love as Chriſt did vnto y• / ſo muſt

thou knowleage thy ſinne and deſyre mercy in Chriſt. A criſtē mā hath nought to reioyſe in / as cōcerninge his deades. His reioyſinge is yt Chriſt died for hī / ād yt he is waſhed ī Chriſtes bloude. Of hys deades reioyſeth he not / nether coūteth his merites / nether giveth pardone of thē / nether ſeketh ā hyer place ī evē of thē / nether maketh hī ſelf a ſavoure of other mē / thorowe his good workes.

Love ſeketh not hyr own profer .ij. Cor. xij. but maketh a mā to forgette hī ſelf / & to turne his profet to ā other mā / as Chriſte ſought not hī ſelfe or hys own profet but oures. This terme my ſelf is not ī y• Goſpell / nether yet father / mother ſiſter / brother / kīſmā / yt one ſhuld be preferred ī love above ā other. But Chriſte is all ī all thīges. Every chriſtē man to an other is Chriſte hym ſelf / and thy neigbours neade hath as good ryght in thy goodes as hath chriſte hym

ſelf which is heyre and lorde over all. And loke what thou oweſt to Chriſte that thou oweſt to thy neybours neade. To thy neybour oweſt thou thine herte / thy ſelfe ād all that thou haſt & canſt do. The love that ſpringeth out of Chriſt excludeth

Yet be cauſe that his abilite of goodes extendeth not ſo ferre / this proviſionis made / that every mā ſhall care for his own howſehold / as father & mother and thine elders that have holpē the / wife chyldern and ſervantes. If thou ſhuldeſt not care and provide for thine howſeholde / thē were thou an infidele / ſeinge thou haſt taken on the ſo to do / and for as moch as that is thy part committed to the of the congregacion. When thou haſt done thy dutie to thine howſehold / and yet haſt forder aboundance of the bleſſinge of God / that oweſt thou to the pore that can not labre / or wold labre and can gett no worke / ād are deſtitute of frendes / to the pore I meane which thou knoweſt / to thē of thine own paryſh.

Thus ys every man that neadeth thy helpe / thy father / mother / ſyſter / and brother in Chriſt: even as every man that doth the wyll of the father / is father / mother / ſiſter / ād brother vnto Chriſte.

But & if he preach willyngly / with a true hert and of conſcience to God: then hath he his rewarde / that is / thē fealeth he the erneſt of eternall lyfe and the workinge of the ſprite of god in hym. And as he fealeth Gods goodnes and mercy / ſo be thou ſure he fealeth hys own infir mite / weaknes and vnworthines / and morneth & knowleageth hys ſinne / in that the hert will not arriſe to worke with that full luſt ād lone that is in Chriſt our lorde. And nevertheleſſe is yet at peace with God thorowe fayth ād truſt in Chriſt Ieſu. For the erneſt of ye ſprite that worketh in hym teſtifieth & beareth wit nes vnto his hert that God hath choſen hī / & that his grace ſhall ſuffice hym / which grace is now not ydle in hym. In hys workes putteth he no truſt.
               Now thou that miuiſtreſt in the kechen & art but a kechē age receaviſt all thinge of y• hond of God / knoweſt that God hath put the in that office / ſubmuteſt thy ſelfe to hye will and ſerveſt thy maſter / not as a man / but as Chriſte hym ſelf with a pure hert / accordinge as Panle teacheth vs / putteſt thy truſt in God / and▪

Now he yt receaveth a prophere in the name of a prophete ſhall receave the reward of a prophet. Math. x. that is / he yt conſenteth to ye dede of a prophete & mainteneth it / the ſame hath the ſame ſprite & erneſt of everlaſting lyfe which the prophete hath & ys electe as the prophete is.
               Now if thou cōpare deade to deade ther ys difference bitwixt / waſſhinge of diſches and preaching of ye worde of God. But as twitehinge to plaiſe God none at all. For nother yt nor this pleaſeth / but as ferforth as God hath choſen a man / hath put his ſprite in hī ād purifyed his hert by fayth and truſt in Chriſte.
               Let every man therfore wayte on the offyce wherin Chriſt hath put him & therin ſerve his bretherne. If he be of lowe degre let him pacyently therein abide tyll God promote hī & exalte hym hier. Let kinges & hed officers ſeke Chriſte in ther offices & miniſtre peace & quietres

Moare over if thou were lorde over all ye worlde / yee of ten worldes byfore thou knewiſte God: yet was not thine appetite quēched / thou thurſtodeſte for more.

It is the ſame God and hath ſworne to vs all that he ſware vnto thē / and is as true as ever he was and therfore can not but fulfyll his promiſes to vs as well as he dyd to them / if we beleve as they dyd.
               The honre ſhall come whē all they that are in the graves ſhall heare his voyce / that is to ſay Chriſtes voyce / and ſhall come forth / they that have done good in to the reſurtection of lyfe ād they that have done evyll in to the reſurrection of damnacion / Jhon .v.

               IF any mā will doe his will (he meaneth the will of y• father) he ſhall knowe of y• doctrine whether it be of God or whether I ſpeake of my ſelfe. Jo. vij. This text meaneth not yt any mā of his own ſtrēgth powere & fre will (as they call it) can doe ye will of God / before he hath receaved the ſprite & ſtrēgth of Chriſte thorowe faith. But here is ment yt which is ſpoken in the thred of John when 
                     •
                  ecodemus marveled howe it were poſſible that a man ſhulde be borne againe. Chriſte anſwered / that which is borne of ye fleſhe is fleſhe ād that which is borne of the ſpryte is ſpryte as who ſhulde ſaye / he that hath the ſprite thorowe fayth and is borne againe and made a new in Chriſte / vnderſtondeth the thinges of the ſprite and what he that is ſpirituall meaneth. But he that is fleſh & as Paule ſaith .j. Corin. ij. a naturall man & leed of his blinde reaſou only / cā never aſcēd to y• capacite of ye ſprite. And he geveth an ēſample ſaīge / y• wīd

bloweth where he lyſteth and thou heareſt his voyce and wotteſt not whence he cometh nor whyder he wyll. So is every mā that is borne of the ſprite / he that ſpeaketh of ye ſprite cā never be vnderſtonde of the naturall mā which is but fleſh ād ſavereth no more then thinges of the fleſh. So here meaneth Chriſt if any mā have ye ſprite / & cōſenteth vnto ye wyll of God / this ſame at ones wotteth what I meane.
            
            
               IFF ye vnderſtonde thes thinges / happie are ye if ye do them Joā. xiij. A criſtē mans herte is with ye will of God / wyth the lawe & cōmanndementes of God / and hō

The outewarde deade teſtifieth what is with in vs / as thou readeſt Joan. v. The deades whych I do / teſtifie of me ſayth Chriſt. And Joā. xiij. hereby ſhall all men knowe that ye are my diſciples / if ye love one an other. And Joā. xiiij. he that hath my cōmaundementes & keapeth thē the ſame it is that loveth me. And agayne / he that loveth me kepeth my cōmaundementes / ād he that loveth me not kepeth not my commaundementes / 

the outwarde deade teſtifyinge of the inwarde herte. And John .xv. Yf ye ſhall kepe my cōmaundementes ye ſhall continue in my love / as I kepe my fathers cōmaundemente and continue in his love. That is / as ye ſe y• love that I have to my father in that I kepe his commaundementes / ſo ſhall ye ſe the love that ye have to me in that ye kepe my commaundementes.
               Thou mayſt not thīke that oure deades bleſſe vs fyrſt and that we prevent God and his grace in Chriſte / as though we in oure naturall gyftes and beinge as we were borne in Adam / loked on the lawe of God and of oure owne ſtrength fulfylled it and ſo became rightewes / and thē with that righteweſnes obtayned the favoure of God. As philoſophers write of righteweſnes / & as the righteweſnes of temporall lawe is / where the lawe is ſatiſfied with the ypocreſie of the outwarde deade. For contrarie to that readeſte thou John .xv. Ye have not choſen me (ſayth Chriſt) but I have choſen you / that ye goo & bringe forth frute / and that youre frute remayne. And in ye ſame chapter. I am a vine ād ye the braunches and with oute me can ye do no thinge. With vs therfore ſo goeth it. In Adam ar we all as it were wilde crabtres / of which God choſeth whom he wyll and plucketh them oute of Adam

and planteth them in the garden of hys mercye and ſtocketh them and graffeth the ſprite of Chriſte in them / which bryngeth forth the frute of the wyll of God / which frute teſtifyeth that God hath bleſſed vs ī Chriſte. Note this alſo / that as longe as we lyve we are yet partly carnall ād fleſhly (notwithſtōdinge yt we are ī Chriſte & though it be not imputed vnto vs for Chriſtes ſake) for there abydeth and remayneth in vs yet of the old Adā as it were the ſtooke of the crabtree / ād ever emonge when occaſion is gyven him / ſhoteth forth hys / braunches and leves / buddde / bloſome and frute. Agaynſt whom we muſte fyght and ſubdue hym and chaunge all hys nature by a lytle and a lytle / wyth prayer faſtinge / watchinge / with vertnoſe meditacion ād holy workes / vntyll we be all together ſpryte. The kingdome of hevē ſayth Chriſt Math. xiij. ys▪ lyke leven which a woman taketh and hydeth in .iij. peckes of meale tyll all belevended. The leven is the ſprite and we the meale which muſt be ſeaſoned with ye ſprite a litle and a lytle tyll we be thorowe owre ſprytuall.
               Wich ſhall rewarde every man accordinge to his deade. Rom. ij. that is accordinge as the deades are / ſo ſhall every mans rewar be / the deades declare what we are / as the frute the tree / accordinge to the frute ſhall the

tree be prayſed. The rewarde is gyven of the mercy and trueth of God / and by the deſervinge and merytes of Chriſte. Whoſoever repenteth / beleveth the Goſpell / and putteth hys truſte in Chriſtes merytes / the ſame ye heyre with Chriſte of eternall lyfe / for aſſuraunce where of the ſprite of God is powred in to his herte as an erneſte / which louſeth hym from the bondes of Sathan / and gyveth hym luſte and ſtrength every day more and more accordinge as he is diligente to axe of God for Chriſtes ſake. And eternall lyfe foloweth good lyvinge. I ſuppoſe (ſayth ſaynte Paule in the ſame pyſtle the .viij. Chapter) that the afflictyons of thys worlde are not worthye of the glorye which ſhalbe ſhowed on vs / yt is to ſay / that which we here ſuffer can never deſerve that rewarde which there / ſhalbe gyvē vs.
               Moare over yf the rewarde ſhulde depēd and hange of the werkes / no man ſhulde be ſaved. For as moch as our beſte deades / compared to the lawe / are damnable ſynne. By the deades of the lawe is no fleſh iuſtyfyed / as it ys wryttē in the thrid Chapter to y• Rom. The lawe iuſtifieth not / but vttereth the ſinne only & compelleth & dryveth the penitēt or repentinge ſinner to fle vnto ye ſeyntory of mercy in y• bloude of Chriſte. Alſo repēte we never ſo moch / be we never ſo well willīge vnto y• lawe

of God. Yet are we ſo weake / and the ſnares ād occaſions ſo in numerable that we falle dayly & hourely. So that we coude not but diſpere / if the rewarde hanged of the worke. Whoſoever aſcribeth eternall lyfe vnto the deſervinge and merite of workes / muſt faule in one of two inconvenientes / ether muſt he be a blinde phariſey not ſeinge that the law ys ſprituall and he carnall / and loke and reioyſe in the outewarde ſhinynge of his deades / deſpyſynge the weke and in reſpecte of them Juſtifie him ſelfe. Or elſe (if he ſe how that the lawe is ſprituall and he never able to aſcende vnto that which the lawe requyreth) he muſt neades deſpere. Let every Chriſten man therfore reioyſe in Chriſte oure hope / truſt and righteweſnes / in whom we are loved / choſen and accepte vnto the enheritaunce of eternall lyfe / nether preſumynge in oure perfectnes / nether deſperinge in oure weaknes. The perfecter a man is / the clerer is his ſight / and ſeyth a thouſande thinges which deſpleaſe him and alſo perfectenes that can not be obtayned in this lyfe. And therfore deſyreth to be with Chriſte / where is no moare ſynne. Let hym tharis weake and can not doe that he wolde fayne doe not deſpeare / but turne to him that ys ſtronge and hath promyſed to geve ſtrength to all that axe of him in Chriſtes name / 

and complaine to God and deſyre him to fullfill his promiſes / and to God committe him ſelfe. And he ſhall of his mercye and trueth ſtrength him and make him feale / with what love he is beloved for Chriſtes ſake / though he be never ſo weake.
            
            
               THey are not righteous before God which heare the lawe / but they which do the lawe ſhall be iuſtyfyed. Romano. ij. This rexte ys playner than that it neadeth to be expouned. In the chapter before Paule proveth that the lawe naturall holpe not the gentyles. For the lawe of God was written in the hertes of the gentyles (as it appereth by the lawes / ſtatutes and ordinaunces which they made inther cytes) yet kepte they them not. The grete kepe the ſmalle vnder forther owne profette with the violence of the lawe. Every man prayſeth the lawe as fer forth as it is profitable and pleaſaunte vnto him ſelfe. But when his awn appetites ſhulde be refrayned / then grudgeth he agaynſt the lawe. More over he proveth that no knowleage holpe the gentyles. For though the lerned men (as the philoſophers) came to the knowleage of God / by the creatures of the worlde / yet had they no power to worſheppe God. In thys ſeconde chapter proveth he that the Iewes (though they had the lawe written) yet is

holpe them not: they coude not kepe it / but were ydolaters and were alſo murtherers / adulters and what ſo ever the lawe forbade. He cō
                  cludeth therefore that the Iewe is as well dā
                  ned as the gentyle. Iff hearinge of the lawe only myght have iuſtifyed / then had the Iewes bin ryghteous. But it required yt a mā do the lawe / if he will be ryghteous. Which becauſe the Iewe did not / he is no leſſe damned then the gentyle. The publiſhinge and declaringe of the lawe doth but vtter a mās ſinne / and geveth nether ſtrength nor helpe to fullfylle the lawe. The lawe kylleth thy conſciens and geveth the no luſt to fullfyll the lawe. Fayth in Chriſt geveth luſt and power to doo the lawe. Now is it true that he which doeth the lawe is righteous / but that doth no man ſave he that beleveth and putteth hys truſt in Chriſte.
            
            
               IFF any mans worke that he hath bylde apon abyde / he ſhall receave a rewarde .i. Corint. ij. The circumſtance of the ſame Chapter / that is to were / that which goeth before & that which foloweth / declareth playnly what is mente. Paule talketh of lerninge doctrine or peachinge. He ſayth that he hym ſelfe hath layd the fundacion / which is Jeſus Chriſte: and that no man can laye any other. He exhorteth therfore every mā to take heade

what he byldeth apon / ād boroweth a ſimilitude of ye goldſmyth which trieth hys metalles with fyre ſayenge that the fyre (that ys) the iudgemente of the ſcripture / ſhall trye every mans worke / that is every mans preachinge and doctrine. Yf any byld vpon the fundaeyon layd of Paule / I meane Jeſus Chriſt / gold ſylver or precious ſtoone / which are all one thynge and ſignifye true doctrine / which when it is examined the ſcripture aloweth / then ſhall he have hys rewarde / that ys he ſhall be ſure that his lernynge is of God / and that Goddes ſpryt ys in hym and that he ſhall have the rewarde that Chriſte hath purchaſed for hym. On the other ſyde yf any man bylde ther on tymbre / heye or ſtubble / which are all one and ſygnyfye doctrine of mans ymagenacyon / tradicyons and fantaſyes which ſtonde not wyth Chriſte when they are examyned and iudged by the ſcripture / he ſhall ſofre damage / but ſhalbe ſaved hym ſelfe / yet as yt were thorowe fyre / that ys / it ſhalbe payneſull vnto hī / that he hath loſt hys laboure / and to ſe hys byldinge periſhe / not wythſtondinge yf he repente and enbrace the truth in Chriſte / he ſhall obteyne mercy & be ſaved. But if Paule were now a live & wolde defende his awne lernīge / he ſhulde be tried thorowe fyre / not thorowe fyre of y• iudgement of

ſcripture (for that lyght men now vtterly refuſe) but by the popes lawe and with fyre of fagottes / 
            
            
               WE muſt all appere before the iudgemente ſeate of Chriſte / for to receave every mā acordinge to ye deades of his body .ij. Corin. v. As thi deades teſtifie of the ſo ſhall thi rewarde be. Thy deades be evyll / then is the wrath of God apon the / and thine herte is evill and ſo ſhall thi rewarde be iff thou repente not. Feare therfore and crye to God for grace / that thou mayſt love hys lawes. And when thou loveſt them ceaſe not tyll thou have optayned power of God to fullfyll them: ſo ſhalt thou beſure that a good rewarde ſhall folowe. Which rewarde not thye deades / but Chriſtes have purchaſed for the / whoſe purchaſinge alſo is that luſt which thow haſt to Goddes lawe / and that mighte where wyth thou

that if the rulers be good / we can not knowe whether we kepe the commaundemente for ye love that we have to Chriſt and to God thorowe him or no. But and if thon canſt fynde in thine herte to doe good vnto him that rewardeth the evyll agayne / then art thou ſure that the ſame ſpirite is in the that is in Chriſte. And it foloweth in the ſame chapter to the Colloſſiens. He that doeth wronge ſhall receave for the wronge that he hath done. That is God ſhall avenge the aboundantly / which ſeyth what wronge is done vnto the and yet ſofereth it for a tyme / that thou myghteſt feale thy pacyence and the workynge of hys ſprite in the / and be made perfecte. Therfore ſe that thou not once deſyre vengeaunce but remitte all vengeaunce vnto God as Chriſt dyd. Whych (Sayth Peter .i. Petri. ij.) when he was revyled / revyled not agayne / nether thretned when he ſofered. Vnto ſuch obedience / vnto ſuch pacyence / vnto ſuch a pore herte / and vnto ſuch fealinge / is Pauls meanynge to bringe all men / and not vnto the vayne dyſputynge of them that aſcrybe ſo hye a place in heven vnto there pylde merytes. Whych as they feale not the workynge of Goddes ſpryte / ſo obey they no man. Yf the fynge do vnto them but ryghte / they wyll interdyte the hole realme / curſe / excomunycate

               THy prayers and almes ar come vp in to remembraunce in the preſens of God. (in the tenth Chapter of the Actes) That is God forgetteth the not / though he come not at the fyrſt callynge / he loketh on ād beholdeth thy prayers and almes. Prayer cometh from the herte. God loketh firſt on the herte / and then on the deade. As thou readiſt Geneſis .iiij. God be helde▪ loked fyrſt on Abell / and then on hys offerynge. Yf the hert be vnpure / the deade veryly playſeth not / as thou ſeyſt in Cayn. Marke the order. In the begynnynge of the chapter thou readeſt / there was a certayne man named Cornelius which feared God / gave moch almes / and praied God alwaye.

What avayleth though a mā ſay that he hath fayth / if he have no deades? cā fayth ſave hī? ād agayne. faith withoute deades is dead in it ſelfe. And y• devils beleve & trēble. And as y• body withoute y• ſpryte is deed / evē ſo faith withoute deades is deed. It is manifeſt ād cleare yt he meaneth not of y• faith where of Peter ād Paule ſpeake in there piſtles / John in his Goſpell ād firſt piſtle / and Chriſte in the Goſpell when he ſaith / thy fayth hath made the ſafe / be it to the accordinge to thy faith / or greate is thy faith & ſo forth / & of which James hym ſelfe ſpeaketh in the fyrſte Chapter ſayinge: of hys own will begate he vs

whith the worde of lyfe / that is in belevīge the promyſes where in is lyfe / are we made the ſonnes of God.
               Whych thinge I alſo thys wiſe prove. Paul ſayth / how ſhall or can they beleve wythoute a preacher? how ſhulde they preach / excepte they were ſente? Now I pray you whē was it hearde that God ſent any man to preach vnto the devyls / or that he made thē any good promes? He threatneth them oft / but never ſent embaſſadours to preach any atonement betwene hym and them. Take an enſample that thou mayſt vnderſtonde. Let there be two pore men both deſtitute of raymente in a colde winter / the one ſtronge that he fealeth no grefe the other grevouſly / morninge for payne of the colde. I then come by and moved with pitye and compaſſion ſaye vnto hym that fealeth his dyſeaſe / come to ſoch a place and I will gyve the raymente ſufficiente. he beleveth / cometh / and obtayneth that which I have promiſed. That other ſeeth all thys and knoweth it / but is partaker of noughte. For he hath no fayth / ād that is becauſe ther is no promiſe made hī. So is i
                     •
                   of the devyls The devyls have no fayth▪ For fayth is but erneſt belevinge of Gods promyſes. Now are there no promyſes made vnto the devyls / but ſore thretninges. The olde Philoſophers knewe that there was one God / 

but yet had no fayth / for they had no powere to ſeke his will nether to worſhippe hym. The turkes and the ſareſons knowe that there is one God / but yet have no fayth. For they have no power to worſhippe God in ſprite to ſeke his playſure and to ſubmytte them vnto hys will. They made an ydolle of God (as we do for the moſt parte) ād worſhipped him every man after hys owne ymagination and for a ſundry purpoſe. What we will have done / that muſt God do / and to do oure will worſhippe we hym and praye vnto him: but what God will have done that will nother turke nor ſareſon nor the moſt parte of vs do. what ſo ever we ymagyon rightheous / that muſt God admitte. But Goddes righteouſnes / will not oure hartes admitte Take an other enſample. Let there be two ſoch as I ſpeake of before & I promiſe both / ād the one becauſe he fealeth not hys dyſeaſe cometh not. So is it of Goddes promyſes. No man is holpe by them but ſynners that feale ther ſynnes / morne and ſorrowe for them and repente with all ther hertes. For John Baptiſte wēte before Chriſte & preached repentaūce / that is / he preached the lawe of God righte / ād brought the people in to knowleage of thē ſelves / & vnto the feare of God / and then ſente them vnto Chriſte to be healed. For in Chriſte & for his ſake only hath

God promiſed to receave / vs vnto mercye / to forgyve vs & to give vs power to reſiſte ſinne How ſhall god ſave the / when thou knoweſt not thye dānacion? How ſhall Chriſte deliver the from ſynne / when thou wilt not knoweleage thy ſynne? Now I pray the how many thowſandes are there of them that ſaye I beleve that Chriſte was borne of a virgī / that he dyed / that he roſe agayn & ſo forth / and thou cāſte not bringe thē in belefe / that they have any ſinne at all?
