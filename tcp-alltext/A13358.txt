               Fairer then rocks of pearle and pretious ſtone,
               More louelie farre then is the morning ſunne,
               When firſt ſhe opes hir orientall gates.
            
            
               Alfon.
               Daughters be gone, and hie you to ye church,
               And I will hie me downe vnto the key,
               To ſee what Marchandiſe is come a ſhore.
            
            Ex. Omnes.
            
               Pol.
               Why how now my Lord, what in a dumpe,
               To ſee theſe damſels paſſe away ſo ſoone?
            
            
               Aurel.
               Truſt me my friend I muſt confeſſe to thee,
               I tooke ſo much delight in theſe faire dames,
               As I doo wiſh they had not gone ſo ſoone,
               But if thou canſt, reſolue me what they be,
               And what old man it was that went with them,
               For I doo long to ſee them once againe.
            
            
               Pol.
               I cannot blame your honor good my lord,
               For they are both louely, wiſe, faire and yong,
               And one of them the yoongeſt of the three
               I long haue lou'd (ſweet friend) and ſhe lou'd me,
               But neuer yet we could not find a meanes
               How we might compaſſe our deſired ioyes.
            
            
               
               Aurel.
               Why, is not her father willing to the match?
            
            
               Pol.
               Yes truſt me, but he hath ſolemnlie ſworne,
               His eldeſt daughter firſt ſhall be eſpowſde,
               Before he grauntes his yoongeſt leaue to loue,
               And therefore he that meanes to get their loues,
               Muſt firſt prouide for her if he will ſpeed,
               And he that hath her ſhall be fettred ſo,
               As good be wedded to the diuell himſelfe,
               For ſuch a skould as ſhe did neuer liue,
               And till that ſhe be ſped none elſe can ſpeed,
               Which makes me thinke that all my labours loſt,
               And whoſoere can get hir firme good will,
               A large dowrie he ſhall be ſure to haue,
               For her father is a man of mightie wealth,
               And an ancient Cittizen of the towne,
               And that was he that went along with them.
            
            
               Aurel.
               But he ſhall keepe hir ſtill by my aduiſe,
               And yet I needs muſt loue his ſecond daughter
               The image of honor and Nobilitie,
               In whoſe ſweet perſon is compriſde the ſomme
               Of natures skill and heauenlie maieſtie.
            
            
               Pol.
               I like your choiſe, and glad you choſe not mine,
               Then if you like to follow on your loue,
               We muſt deuiſe a meanes and find ſome one
               That will attempt to wed this deuiliſh skould,
               And I doo know the man. Come hither boy,
               Go your waies ſirha to Ferandoes houſe,
               Deſire him take the paines to come to me,
               For I muſt ſpeake with him immediatlie.
            
            
               Boy.
               I will ſir, and fetch him preſentlie.
            
            
               Pol.
               A man I thinke will fit hir humor right,
               As blunt in ſpeech as ſhe is ſharpe of toong,
               And he I thinke will match hir euerie waie,
               And yet he is a man of wealth ſufficient,
               
                  And for his perſon worth as good as ſhe,
               And if he compaſſe hir to be his wife,
               Then may we freelie viſite both our loues.
            
            
               Aurel.
               O might I ſee the center of my ſoule
               Whoſe ſacred beautie hath inchanted me,
               More faire then was the Grecian Helena
               
               For whoſe ſweet ſake ſo many princes dide,
               That came with thouſand ſhippes to Tenedos,
               
               But when we come vnto hir fathers houſe,
               Tell him I am a Marchants ſonne of Ceſtus,
               
               That comes for traffike vnto Athens heere,
               And heere ſirha I will change with you for once,
               And now be thou the Duke of Ceſtus ſonne,
               Reuell and ſpend as if thou wert my ſelfe,
               For I will court my loue in this diſguiſe.
            
            
               Val.
               My lord, how if the Duke your father ſhould
               By ſome meanes come to Athens for to ſee
               How you doo profit in theſe publike ſchooles,
               And find me clothed thus in your attire,
               How would he take it then thinke you my lord?
            
            
               Aurel.
               Tuſh feare not Valeria let me alone,
               But ſtaie, heere comes ſome other companie.
            
            Enter Ferando and his man Saunders with a blew coat.
            
               Pol.
               Here comes the man that I did tel you of.
            
            
               Feran.
               Good morrow gentlemen to all at once.
               How now Polidor, what man ſtill in loue?
               Euer wooing and canſt thou neuer ſpeed,
               God ſend me better luck when I ſhall woo.
            
            
               San.
               
                  I warrant you maiſter and you take my councell.
            
            
               Feran.
               Why ſirha, are you ſo cunning?
            
            
               San.
               Who I, twere better for you by fiue marke
               And you could tel how to doo it as well as I.
            
            
               
               Pol.
               I would thy maiſter once were in the vaine,
               To trie himſelfe how he could woe a wench.
            
            
               Feran.
               Faith I am euen now a going.
            
            
               San.
               I faith ſir, my maiſters going to this geere now.
            
            
               Pol.
               Whither in faith Ferando, tell me true.
            
            
               Feran.
               To bonie Kate, the patientſt wench aliue
               The diuel himſelfe dares ſcarce venter to woo her,
               Signior Alfonſos eldeſt daughter,
               And he hath promiſde me ſix thouſand crownes
               If I can win her once to be my wife,
               And ſhe and I muſt woo with skoulding ſure,
               And I will hold hir toot till ſhe be wearie,
               Or elſe Ile make her yeeld to graunt me loue.
            
            
               Pol.
               How like you this Aurelius, I thinke he knew
               Our mindes before we ſent to him,
               But tell me, when doo you meane to ſpeake with her?
            
            
               Feran.
               Faith preſentlie, doo you but ſtand aſide,
               And I will make her father bring hir hither,
               And ſhe, and I, and he, will talke alone.
            
            
               Pol.
               With al our heartes, Come Aurelius
               
               Let vs be gone and leaue him heere alone.
            
            Exit.
            
               Feran.
               Ho Signiour Alfonſo, whoſe within there?
            
            
               Alfon.
               Signiour Ferando your welcome hartilie,
               You are a ſtranger ſir vnto my houſe.
               Harke you ſir, looke what I did promiſe you
               Ile performe, if you get my daughters loue.
            
            
               Feran.
               Then when I haue talkt a word or two with hir,
               Doo you ſtep in and giue her hand to me,
               And tell her when the marriage daie ſhal be,
               For I doo know ſhe would be married faine,
               And when our nuptiall rites be once performde
               Let me alone to tame hir well enough,
               Now call her foorth that I may ſpeake with hir.
            
            Enter Kate.
            
            
               
               Alfon.
               Ha Kate, Come hither wench & liſt to me,
               Vſe this gentleman friendlie as thou canſt.
            
            
               Feran.
               Twentie good morrowes to my louely Kate.
               
            
            
               Kate.
               You ieſt I am ſure, is ſhe yours alreadie?
            
            
               Feran.
               I tell thee Kate I know thou lou'ſt me well.
            
            
               Kate.
               The deuill you doo, who told you ſo?
            
            
               Feran.
               My mind ſweet Kate doth ſay I am the man,
               Muſt wed, and bed, and marrie bonnie Kate.
               
            
            
               Kate.
               Was euer ſeene ſo groſe an aſſe as this?
            
            
               Feran.
               I, to ſtand ſo long and neuer get a kiſſe.
            
            
               Kate.
               Hands off I ſay, and get you from this place;
               Or I wil ſet my ten commandments in your face.
            
            
               Feran.
               I prethe doo kate; they ſay thou art a ſhrew,
               And I like thee the better for I would haue thee ſo.
            
            
               Kate.
               Let go my hand, for feare it reach your eare.
            
            
               Feran.
               No kate, this hand is mine and I thy loue.
            
            
               Kate.
               In faith ſir no the woodcock wants his taile.
            
            
               Feran.
               But yet his bil wil ſerue, if the other faile.
            
            
               Alfon.
               How now Ferando, what ſaies my daughter?
            
            
               Feran.
               Shees willing ſir and loues me as hir life.
            
            
               Kate.
               Tis for your skin then, but not to be your wife.
            
            
               Alfon.
               Come hither Kate and let me giue thy hand
               To him that I haue choſen for thy loue,
               And thou to morrow ſhalt be wed to him.
            
            
               Kate.
               Why father, what do you meane to do with me,
               To giue me thus vnto this brainſick man,
               That in his mood cares not to murder me?
               She turnes aſide and ſpeakes.
               But yet I will conſent and marrie him,
               For I methinkes haue liude too long a maid,
               And match him to, or elſe his manhoods good.
            
            
               Alfon.
               Giue me thy hand Ferando loues thee wel,
               And will with wealth and eaſe maintaine thy ſtate.
               Here Ferando take her for thy wife,
               
                  And ſunday next ſhall be your wedding day.
            
            
               Feran.
               Why ſo, did I not tell thee I ſhould be the man
               Father, I leaue my louelie Kate with you,
               Prouide your ſelues againſt our mariage daie,
               For I muſt hie me to my countrie houſe
               In haſt, to ſee prouiſion may be made,
               To entertaine my Kate when ſhe dooth come.
            
            
               Alfon.
               Doo ſo, come Kate, why dooſt thou looke
               So ſad, be merrie wench thy wedding daies at hand.
               Sonne fare you well, and ſee you keepe your promiſe.
            
            
               Exit Alfonſo and Kate.
            
            
               Feran.
               So, all thus farre goes well. Ho Saunder.
               
            
            Enter Saunder laughing.
            
               San.

               Feran.
               Why didſt thou think that I did not ſpeake wel to hir?
            
            
               San.
               You ſpoke like an aſſe to her, Ile tel you what,

               Cloke on that you haue, chud haue had her before ſhe

               Feran.
               Wel ſirha, & yet thou ſeeſt I haue got her for all this.
            
            
               San.
               I marry twas more by hap then any good cunning
               I hope ſheele make you one of the head men of the pariſh ſhortly.
            
            
               Feran.
               Wel ſirha leaue your ieſting and go to Polidors houſe,
               The yong gentleman that was here with me,
               And tell him the circumſtance of all thou knowſt,
               Tell him on ſunday next we muſt be married,
               And if he aske thee whither I am gone,

               Vale.
               The ſenceleſſe trees by muſick haue bin moou'd
               And at the ſound of pleaſant tuned ſtrings,
               
                  Haue ſauage beaſtes hung downe their liſtning heads,
               As though they had beene caſt into a trance.

               With muſickes ſound in time may be ſurpriſde,

               It is no matter whether I doo or no,

               In you with a peſtlence, are you ſo kind?
               Then make a night cap of your fiddles caſe,
               To warme your head, and hide your filthie face.
            
            
               Val.
               If that ſweet miſtreſſe were your harts content,
               You ſhould command a greater thing then that,
               Although it were ten times to my diſgrace.
            
            
               Kate.

               Kate.
               No, but I meane to moue thee.
            
            
               Val.
               Well, will you plaie a little?
            
            
               Kate.
               I, giue me the Lute.
            
            She plaies.
            
               Val.
               That ſtop was falſe, play it againe.
            
            
               Kate.
               Then mend it thou, thou filthy aſſe.
            
            
               Val.
               What, doo you bid me kiſſe your arſe?

               She offers to ſtrike him with the lute.
            
            
               Val.
               Hold miſtreſſe, ſouns wil you breake my lute?
            
            
               Kate.
               
                  I on thy head, and if thou ſpeake to me,
               
                  There take it vp and fiddle ſomewhere elſe,
               She throwes it downe.
               And ſee you come no more into this place,
               Leaſt that I clap your fiddle on your face.
            
            Ex. Kate.
            
               Val.
               Souns, teach hir to play vpon the lute?
               The deuill ſhal teach her firſt, I am glad ſhees gone,
               For I was neare ſo fraid in all my life,
               But that my lute ſhould flie about mine eares,
               My maiſter ſhall teach her his ſelfe for me,
               For Ile keepe me far enough without hir reach,
               For he and Polydor ſent me before
               To be with her and teach her on the lute,
               Whilſt they did court the other gentlewomen,
               And heere methinkes they come togither.
            
            Enter Aurelius, Polidor, Emelia, and Philena.

               Why Valeria, will ſhe not learne apace?

               Come faire Emelia my louelie loue,
               Brighter then the burniſht pallace of the ſunne,
               The eie-ſight of the glorious firmament,
               In whoſe bright lookes ſparkles the radiant fire,
               Wilie Prometheus ſlilie ſtole from Ioue,
               
               Infuſing breath, life, motion, ſoule,

               Oh faire Emelia I pine for thee,

               Eme.
               Fie man, I know you will not die for loue:
               Ah Polidor thou needſt not to complaine,
               Eternall heauen ſooner be diſſolude,
               And all that pearſeth Phebus ſiluer eie,
               Before ſuch hap befall to Polidor.
               
            
            
               Pol.
               Thanks faire Emelia for theſe ſweet words,
               But what ſaith Phylena to hir friend?
            
            
               Phyle.
               Why I am buying marchandiſe of him.
            
            
               Aurel.
               Miſtreſſe you ſhall not need to buie of me,
               For when I croſt the bubling Canibey,
               And ſailde along the Criſtall Heliſpont,
               I filde my cofers of the wealthie mines,
               Where I did cauſe Millions of labouring Moores
               To vndermine the cauernes of the earth,
               To ſeeke for ſtrange and new found pretious ſtones,
               And diue into the ſea to gather pearle,
               As faire as Iuno offered Priams ſonne,
               And you ſhall take your liberall choice of all.
            
            
               Phyle.
               
                  I thanke you ſir and would Phylena might
               In any curteſie requite you ſo,
               As ſhe with willing hart could well beſtow.
            
            Enter Alfonſo.
            
            
               Alfon.
               How now daughters, is Ferando come?
            
            
               Eme.
               Not yet father, I wonder he ſtaies ſo long.
            
            
               Alfon.
               And wheres your ſiſter that ſhe is not heere?
            
            
               Phyle.
               She is making of hir readie father
               To goe to church and if that he were come.
            
            
               Pol.
               
                  I warrant you heele not be long awaie.
            
            
               Alfon.
               Go daughters get you in, and bid your
               Siſter prouide her ſelfe againſt that we doo come,
               And ſee you goe to church along with vs.
               
                  Exit Philena and Emelia.
               
               I maruell that Ferando comes not away.
            
            
               
               Pol.
               His Tailor it may be hath bin too ſlacke,
               In his apparrell which he meanes to weare,
               For no queſtion but ſome fantaſticke ſutes
               He is determined to weare to day,
               And richly powdered with pretious ſtones,
               Spotted with liquid gold, thick ſet with pearle,
               And ſuch he meanes ſhall be his wedding ſutes.
            
            
               Alfon.
               I carde not I what coſt he did beſtow,
               In gold or ſilke, ſo he himſelfe were heere,
               For I had rather loſe a thouſand crownes,
               Then that he ſhould deceiue vs heere to daie,
               But ſoft I thinke I ſee him come.
            
            Enter Ferando baſelie attired, and a red cap on his head.
            
               Feran.
               Godmorow father, Polidor well met,
               You wonder I know that I haue ſtaid ſo long.
            
            
               Alfon.
               I marrie ſon, we were almoſt perſwaded,
               That we ſhould ſcarſe haue had our bridegroome heere,
               But ſay, why art thou thus baſely attired?
            
            
               Feran.
               Thus richlie father you ſhould haue ſaid,
               For when my wife and I am married once,
               Shees ſuch a ſhrew, if we ſhould once fal out,
               Sheele pul my coſtlie ſutes ouer mine eares,
               And therefore am I thus attired awhile,
               For manie thinges I tell you's in my head,
               And none muſt know thereof but Kate and I,
               
               For we ſhall liue like lammes and Lions ſure,
               Nor lammes to Lions neuer was ſo tame,
               If once they lie within the Lions pawes
               As Kate to me if we were married once,
               And therefore come let vs to church preſently.
            
            
               Pol.
               Fie Ferando not thus atired for ſhame,
               Come to my Chamber and there ſute thy ſelfe,
               
                  Of twentie ſutes that I did neuer were▪
               
            
            
               Feran.
               Tuſh Polidor I haue as many ſutes
               Fantaſticke made to fit my humor ſo
               As any in Athens and as richlie wrought
               As was the Maſſie Robe that late adornd,
               The ſtately legate of the Perſian King,
               And this from them haue I made choiſe to weare.
            
            
               Alfon.
               I prethie Ferando let me intreat
               Before thou goſte vnto the church with vs,
               To put ſome other ſute vpon thy backe.
            
            
               Feran.
               Not for the world if I might gaine it ſo,
               And therefore take me thus or not at all,
               Enter Kate.
               
               But ſoft ſe where my Kate doth come,
               I muſt ſalute hir: how fares my louely Kate?
               
               What art thou readie? ſhall we go to church?
            
            
               Kate.
               Not I with one ſo mad, ſo baſely tirde,
               To marrie ſuch a filthie ſlauiſh groome,
               That as it ſeemes ſometimes is from his wits,
               Or elſe he would not thus haue come to vs.
            
            
               Feran.
               Tuſh Kate theſe words addes greater loue in me
               And makes me thinke thee fairrer then before,
               Sweete Kate the louelier then Dianas purple robe,
               Whiter then are the ſnowie Apenis,
               Or icie haire that groes on Boreas chin.
               Father I ſweare by Ibis golden beake,
               More faire and Radiente is my bonie Kate,
               
               Then ſiluer Zanthus when he doth imbrace,
               The ruddie Simies at Idas feete,
               And care not thou ſwete Kate how I be clad,
               Thou ſhalt haue garments wrought of Median ſilke,
               Enchaſt with pretious Iewells fecht from far,
               By Italian Marchants that with Ruſſian ſtemes,
               Plous vp huge ſorrowes in the Terren Maine,
               
               
                  And better farre my louely Kate ſhall weare,
               Then come ſweet loue and let vs to the church,
               For this I ſweare ſhall be my wedding ſute.

               I would be loth that they ſhould diſagree,

               Did you ſo you damned villaine.
               He beates them all out againe.
               This humor muſt I holde me to a while,
               
                  To bridle and hold backe my headſtrong wife,
               With curbes of hunger: eaſe: and want of ſleepe,

               Ile mew her vp as men do mew their hawkes,
               And make her gentlie come vnto the lure,
               Were ſhe as ſtuborne or as full of ſtrength
               As were the Thracian horſe Alcides tamde,
               That King Egeus fed with fleſh of men,
               Yet would I pull her downe and make her come
               As hungry hawkes do flie vnto there lure.
            
            Exit.
            Enter Aurelius and Valeria.

               As faire as is the milke white way of Ioue,
               As chaſt as Phoebe in her ſommer ſportes,
               As ſofte and tender as the aſure downe,
               That circles Cithereas ſiluer doues.
               Her do I meane to make my louely bride,
               And in her bed to breath the ſweete content,
               That I thou knowſt long time haue aimed at.
               Now Valeria it reſts in thee to helpe

               He is: and Polidor ſhortly ſhall be wed,
               And he meanes to tame his wife erelong.

               Val.
               Thats rare: but what decorum dos he vſe?
            
            
               Aurel.
               Faith I know not: but by ſom odde deuiſe
               Or other, but come Valeria I long to ſee the man,
               By whome we muſt compriſe our plotted drift,

               Then come my Lord and I will bring you to him ſtraight.
            
            
               Aurel.
               Agreed, then lets go.

               Or fall and periſh as did Icarus.
               
            
            
               Aurel.
               Sweetly reſolued faire Emelia,
               
               But would Phylema ſay as much to me,
               If I ſhould aske a queſtion now of thee,
               What if the duke of Ceſtus only ſon,
               Which came with me vnto your fathers houſe,
               Should ſeeke to git Phylemas loue from me,
               
                  And make thee Duches of that ſtately towne,
               Wouldſt thou not then forſake me for his loue?
            
            
               Phyle.
               Not for great Neptune, no nor Ioue himſelfe,
               Will Phylema leaue Aurelius loue,
               Could he inſtall me Empres of the world,
               Or make me Queene and guidres of the heauens,
               Yet would I not exchange thy loue for his,
               Thy company is poore Philemas heauen,
               And without thee, heauen were hell to me.
            
            
               Eme.
               And ſhould my loue as erſte did Hercules
               
               Attempt to paſſe the burning valtes of hell,
               I would with piteous lookes and pleaſing wordes,
               As once did Orpheus with his harmony,
               And rauiſhing ſound of his melodious harpe,
               Intreate grim Pluto and of him obtaine,
               That thou mighteſt go and ſafe retourne againe.
            
            
               Phyle.
               And ſhould my loue as earſt Leander did,
               Attempte to ſwimme the boyling heliſpont
               For Heros loue: no towers of braſſe ſhould hold
               But I would follow thee through thoſe raging flouds,
               With lockes diſheuered and my breſt all bare,
               With bended knees vpon Abidas ſhoore,
               I would with ſmokie ſighes and briniſh teares,
               Importune Neptune and the watry Gods,
               To ſend a guard of ſiluer ſcaled Dolphyns,
               
               With ſounding Tritons to be our conuoy,
               And to tranſport vs ſafe vnto the ſhore,
               Whilſt I would hang about thy louely necke,
               Redoubling kiſſe on kiſſe vpon thy cheekes,
               And with our paſtime ſtill the ſwelling waues.
            
            
               Eme.
               Should Polidor as great Achilles did,
               Onely imploy himſelfe to follow armes,
               Like to the warlike Amazonian Queene,
               
                  Pentheſelea Hectors paramore,
               
                  Who foyld the bloudie Pirrhus murderous greeke,
               Ile thruſt my ſelfe amongſt the thickeſt throngs,
               And with my vtmoſt force aſſiſt my loue.
            
            
               Phyle.
               Let Eole ſtorme: be mild and quiet thou,
               Let Neptune ſwell, be Aurelius calme and pleaſed,
               I care not I, betide what may betide,
               Let fates and fortune doo the worſt they can,
               I recke them not: they not diſcord with me,
               Whilſt that my loue and I do well agree▪
               
            
            
               Aurel.
               Sweet Phylema bewties mynerall,
               From whence the ſun exhales his glorious ſhine,
               And clad the heauen in thy reflected raies,

               Duke.
               Thus all alone from Ceſtus am I come,
               And left my princelie courte and noble traine,
               To come to Athens, and in this diſguiſe,

               More cleere of hew and far more beautifull,
               Then pretious Sardonix or purple rockes,
               Of Amitheſts or gliſtering Hiaſinthe,
               
               More amiable farre then is the plain,
               Where gliſtring Cepherus in ſiluer boures,
               Gaſeth vpon the Giant Andromede,

               Kate.
               Faire louely lady, bright and Chriſtalline,
               Bewteous and ſtately as the eie-traind bird,
               As glorious as the morning waſht with dew,
               Within whoſe eies ſhe takes her dawning beames,
               And golden ſommer ſleepes vpon thy cheekes,
               Wrap vp thy radiations in ſome cloud,
               Leaſt that thy bewty make this ſtately towne,
               Inhabitable like the burning Zone,

               Duke.
               What is ſhe mad to? or is my ſhape transformd▪
               
               That both of them perſwade me I am a woman,
               But they are mad ſure, and therefore Ile begon,
               And leaue their companies for fear of harme,
               And vnto Athens haſt to ſeeke my ſon.
            
            Exit Duke.
            
               Feran.
               Why ſo Kate this was friendly done of thee,
               And kindly too: why thus muſt we two liue,
               One minde, one heart, and one content for both,
               This good old man dos thinke that we are mad,
               And glad he is I am ſure, that he is gonne,
               But come ſweet Kate for we will after him,
               And now perſwade him to his ſhape againe.

               Come louely ſonnes your marriage rites performed,
               Lets hie vs home to ſee what cheere we haue,
               I wonder that Ferando and his wife

               Pol.
               No maruell if Ferando be away,
               His wife I think hath troubled ſo his wits,
               
                  That he remaines at home to keepe them warme,
               For forward wedlocke as the prouer be ſayes,
               Hath brought him to his night cappe long agoe.

               But Polidor let my ſon and you take heede,
               That Ferando ſay not ere long as much to you,
               And now Alfonſo more to ſhew my loue,
               If vnto Ceſtus you do ſend your ſhips,
               My ſelfe will fraught them with Arabian ſilkes,

               Vale.
               And for to honour him and this faire bride,
               Enter the Duke of Ceſtus.

               Duke.
               I am glad ſir that you would be ſo franke,
               Are you become the Duke of Ceſtus ſon,
               And reuels with my treaſure in the towne,

               Why ſir, are you acquainted with my ſon?

               Pardon me father: humblie on my knees,
               I do intreat your grace to heare me ſpeake.

               Peace villaine: lay handes on them,
               And ſend them to priſon ſtraight.
            
            
               Phylotus and Valeria runnes away. Then Slie ſpeakes.

               Lord.
               No more they ſhall not my Lord,

               Are they run away Sim? thats well,

               Ah trecherous boy that durſt preſume,

               That damned villaine that hath deluded me▪
               
               Whome I did ſend guide vnto my ſon,
               Oh that my furious force could cleaue the earth,
               That I might muſter bands of helliſh feendes,
               To rack his heart and teare his impious ſoule.
               The ceaſeleſſe turning of celeſtiall orbes,
               Kindles not greater flames in flitting aire,

               Then let my death ſweet father end your griefe,
               For I it is that thus haue wrought your woes,
               Then be reuengd on me for here I ſweare,
               That they are innocent of what I did,
               Oh had I charge to cut of Hydraes hed,
               To make the topleſſe Alpes a champion field,
               To kill vntamed monſters with my ſword,
               To trauell dayly in the hotteſt ſun,
               And watch in winter when the nightes be colde,
               
                  I would with gladneſſe vndertake them all,
               And thinke the paine but pleaſure that I felt,
               So that my noble father at my returne,
               Would but forget and pardon my offence,
            
            
               Phile.
               Let me intreat your grace vpon my knees,
               To pardon him and let my death diſcharge
               The heauy wrath your grace hath vowd gainſt him.

               Nay then Ferando he muſt needes ſit out,
               For he may call I thinke till he be weary,
               Before his wife will come before ſhe liſt.
            
            
               Feran.
               Tis well for you that haue ſuch gentle wiues,

               How now Ferando you dare not lay belike.
            
            
               Feran.
               Why true I dare not lay indeede;
               But how, ſo little mony on ſo ſure a thing,
               
                  A hundred pound: why I haue layd as much
               Vpon my dogge, in running at a Deere,
               She ſhall not come ſo farre for ſuch a trifle,
               But will you lay fiue hundred markes with me,
               And whoſe wife ſooneſt comes when he doth call,
               And ſhewes her ſelfe moſt louing vnto him,
               Let him inioye the wager I haue laid,
               Now what ſay you? dare you aduenture thus?

               Alfon.
               Why then Ferando he is ſure to loſe,
               I promiſe thee ſon thy wife will hardly come,
               And therefore I would not wiſh thee lay ſo much.
            
            
               Feran.
               Tuſh father were it ten times more,
               I durſt aduenture on my louely Kate,
               
               But if I loſe Ile pay, and ſo ſhall you.
            
            
               Aurel.
               Vpon mine honour if I looſe Ile pay.
            
            
               Pol.
               And ſo will I vpon my faith I vow.
            
            
               Feran.
               Then ſit we downe and let vs ſend for them.
            
            
               Alfon.
               I promiſe thee Ferando I am afraid thou wilt loſe

            Exit Valeria.
            
               Aurel.
               Now for my hundred pound.
               Would any lay ten hundred more with me,
               I know I ſhould obtaine it by her loue.
            
            
               Feran.
               I pray God you haue not laid too much already.
            
            
               Aurel.

               Enter Valeria againe.
               Now ſirra what ſaies your miſtris?
            
            
               Val.
               She is ſomething buſie but ſhele come anon.
            
            
               Feran.
               Why ſo, did not I tell you this before,
               She is buſie and cannot come.

               I pray God your wife ſend you ſo good an anſwere
               She may be buſie yet ſhe ſayes ſhele come.

                  Polidor I dare preſume for thee,

               And I do maruell much Aurelius,

            Enter the Boy againe▪
            
            
               Pol.
               Now wheres your Miſtris?

               She bad me tell you that ſhe will not come,
               And you haue any buſineſſe, you muſt come to her.
            
            
               Feran.
               Oh monſtrous intollerable preſumption,
               Worſe then a blaſing ſtarre, or ſnow at midſommer,
               Earthquakes or any thing vnſeaſonable,
               She will not come: but he muſt come to her.

            Exit Sander.

               Feran.
               The mores the pittie: then I muſt loſe.
               Enter Kate and Sander.
               
               But I haue won for ſee where Kate doth come.
            
            
               Kate.
               Sweet husband did you ſend for me?

               Pull it of and treade it vnder thy feete,
               Tis fooliſh I will not haue thee weare it.
            
            She takes of her cap and treads on it.
            
               
               Pol.
               Oh wonderfull metamorphoſis.

               Bring them perforce and make them come with thee.

               But you ſhall ſee ſhe will do more then this,

               A gulfe of gulfes, a body bodiles,
