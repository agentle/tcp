which the Spanyards had prepared to whippe and torment English men and women:
which were found and taken at the ouerthrow of certaine of the Spanish Shippes
in Iuly last past. 1588.
            To the tune of the valiant Soldiour.
            
               
                  Whippes for the women.
                  Whippes for the men.
               
            
            
               AL you that list to looke and see
               what profite comes from Spayne,
               
               And what the Pope and Spanyards both,
               prepared for our gayne.
               Then turne your eyes and bend your eares,
               and you shall heare and see,
               What courteous minds, what gentle harts
               they beare to thee and mee.
            
            
               They say they seeke for Englands good,
               and wish the people well:
               They say they are such holie men,
               all other they excell.
               They bragge that they are Catholikes,
               and Christes only Spouse:
               And what so ere they take in hand,
               the holie Pope allowes.
            
            
               These holie men, these sacred Saints,
               and these that thinke no ill:
               See how they fought against all right,
               to murder, spoyle and kill.
               Our noble Queene and Countrie first,
               they did prepare to spoyle:
               To ruinate our liues and lands,
               with trouble and turmoyle.
            
            
               And not content by fire and sword
               to take our right away:
               But to torment most cruelly
               our bodies night and day.
               Although they ment with murdring hands
               our guiltlesse bloud to spill:
               Before our deathes they did deuise
               to whip vs first their fill.
            
            
               And for that purpose had preparde
               of whips such wondrouse store,
               So straungely made, that sure the like
               was neuer seene before.
               For neuer was there Horse nor Mule,
               nor dogge of currish kinde,
               That euer had such whips deuisde
               by any sauadge minde.
            
            
               One sorte of whips they had for men,
               so smarting fierce and fell:
               As like could neuer be deuisde
               by any deuill in hell.
               The strings whereof with wyerie knots,
               like rowels they did frame,
               That euery stroke might teare the flesh
               they layd on with the same.
            
            
               And pluckt the spreading sinewes from
               the hardned bloudie bone,
               To pricke and pearce each tender veine,
               within the bodie knowne.
               And not to leaue one crooked ribbe,
               on any side vnseene:
               Nor yet to leaue a lumpe of flesh
               the head and foote betweene.
            
            
               And for our seelie women eke,
               their hearts with griefe to clogge,
               They made such whips wherewith no man
               would seeme to strike a dogge:
               So strengthned eke with brasen tagges,
               and filde so rough, and thin
               That they would force at euery lash
               the bloud abroad to spinne.
            
            
               Although their bodies sweet and fayre,
               their spoyle they ment to make:
               And on them first their filthie lust
               and pleasure for to take.
               Yet afterward such sower sauce
               they should be sure to finde,
               That they shoulde curse each springing braunch
               that cometh of their kinde.
            
            
               O Ladies fayre what spite were this,
               your gentle hearts to kill:
               To see these deuilish tyrants thus
               your childrens bloud to spill.
               What griefe vnto the husband deere,
               his louing wife to see
               Tormented so before his face
               with extreame villanie.
            
            
               And thinke you not that they which had
               such dogged mindes to make
               Such instruments of tyrannie,
               had not like hearts to take
               The greatest vengeance that they might
               vpon vs euery one:
               Yes, yes, be sure, for godlie feare
               and mercie they haue none.
            
            
               Euen as in India once they did
               against those people there,
               With cruell Curres in shamefull sorte
               the men both rent and teare:
               And set the Ladies great with childe
               vpright against a tree,
               And shoot thē through with pearcing darts,
               such would their practise bee.
            
            
               Did not the Romans in this land,
               sometime like practise vse,
               Against the Brittaines bolde in heart,
               and wonderously abuse
               The valiant King whom they had caught
               before his Queene and wife,
               And with most extreame tyrannie
               dispatcht him of his life?
            
            
               The good Queene Voadicia,
               
               and eke her daughters three:
               Did they not first abuse them all
               by lust and lecherie:
               And after stript them naked all,
               and whipt them in such sorte:
               That it would grieue each Christian heart
               to heare that iust reporte.
            
            
               And if these ruffling mates of Rome
               
               did Princes thus torment:
               Thinke you the Romish Spanyards now
               would not shewe their desent.
               How did they late in Rome reioyce,
               in Italie and Spayne:
               
               What ringing and what Bonfires,
               what Masses sung amaine.
            
            
               What printed Bookes were sent about,
               as filled their desire:
               How England was by Spanyards wonne,
               and London set on fire.
               Be these the men that are so milde,
               whom some so holie call:
               The Lord defend our noble Queene,
               and Countrie from them all.
