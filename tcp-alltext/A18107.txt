receiued, that by your Royall authoritie the deceitfull plotters of it were duely puniſhed, I thought it would be ſome reproach to mee, if a Sonne ſhould conferre nothing to the pious vindicating of his Father. And yet it is not ſo much the defence of him, that I haue here vndertaken, as the vindicating of the Truth it ſelfe, which your Maieſ

Patronage, the better to deceiue the world.

            THE DEFENCE AND VINDICATING of IS. CASAVBON;
            
               Againſt thoſe Impoſtors, that lately publiſhed an impious and vnlearned Booke, intituled, The Originall of Idolatries, &c. vnder his name.
            
               VNto how great and various iniuries the names of well-deſeruing men are ſubiect after their death, I would it had been my hap to haue learned any other where, then to haue had ſuch neere experience of it at home. I was in good hope my care had been at an end, in anſwering their ſundrie calumnies, that being of a contrary part, ſet vpon my Fathers name like open enemies; yet theſe,

inaſmuch as they profeſſed themſelues his aduerſaries, and were cleane oppoſite againſt him in the caſe it ſelfe, ſeemed to bee the leſſe dangerous, and not ſo much to be feared. But now I muſt haue to doe with other manner of men, that pretending nothing leſſe then any malice or hatred againſt him, haue vnder faire ſhews of good-will, moſt groſſely abuſed his eſtimation & credit. But the leſſeſuſpicion there is of an iniury, the greater is the iniury done to a man, and the more hainouſly to be accounted of.
            Not many weekes ſince there was a Booke publiſhed vnder the name of Iſaac Caſaubon: Which for the Argument was not altogether vnlike thoſe workes of his, that he had partly publiſhed already, and partly vndertaken to write, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter. And for the place; who would imagine that any thing ſhould come foorth in Print at London to Caſaubon's diſgrace; where, as long as he liued, hee was ſo much eſteemed of by his Maieſtie, and the chiefeſt of the land;

and now hee is dead, I hope I may ſay his memory is precious to all honeſt men? And beſides, for him that procured the booke to be ſet foorth, hee is ſo profuſe in his praiſe, that a man would thinke hee meant him no ſmall addition of glory by his large commendations. But if you once reade the booke it ſelfe, you ſhall ſoone ſee it is ſuch kinde of ſtuffe, as cannot bee imagined to haue been my Fathers, without his great ſhame and infamie, being a Pamphlet full of ſuch groſſe ignorance, malignity, and moſt inſolent deſire of nouitie in Religion. Surely the Author of it deſerues the name of a Schiſmatike, (that I may ſay no worſe) and whoſoeuer hee was, is worthy to bee puniſhed for ſuch a one, as being no leſſer enemy to the Church of England, then hee is iniurious to my Fathers good name.
            But that the Reader may wonder the leſſe at it, it is no new thing for bookes of nouell and vnſound doctrine to bee fathered vpon ſuch men that be free from

error, and ſound in their opinions. Euery one of the worſt and vileſt Heretikes were wont to vſe this craft long agoe, to maske vnder other mens names of eſteem and authority, that ſo they might the better inſinuate their pernicious doctrines into them that little vnderſtood what they were, and ſeduce the ſimpler ſort of people from the right way. And thereupon it came, that ſo many bookes fraught with peſtilent doctrine were a
                  •
               
               tributed of old, to the holy and orthodox Fathers, and at this day goe a great number of them vnder their names; many whereof at the firſt perhaps might be their owne, but afterwards came to bee ſo corrupted and adulterated by other mens impurities, that like baſtards their owne reputed parents would not acknowledge them. Of which thing euen Origen alone may bee a ſufficient example; who was long ſince numbred among the Arch-heretikes themſelues, and yet both by ancient and moderne writers is moſt ſtrongly defended to

haue been an Orthodoxe Father, many things being falſely imputed vnto him by Heretikes, and his Bookes otherwiſe pure and ſound, by them corrupted and plaiſtered ouer with their owne dawbings; as S. Ierome and Vincentius Lirinenfis with others haue written of his old Apologiſts. But, to be ſhort, whether wee exemplifie this kinde of impoſture by old or new times, I dare ſay, that there was neuer any baſtard-booke fathered vpon a man with more notable impudence and fraud, then this was vpon Caſaubon.
            
            What purpoſe they had that were the contriuers of ſuch couſenage, and what ſhould chiefly mooue them to doe 
                  •
               o vnworthy an act, many probable coniectures may be made. It is not vnlikely that ſome ſculking crafty Puritan came ſtealing out with it, to trie if hee could doe the Church of England a miſchiefe. Peraduenture one that bare ſome priuate grudge againſt my Father, thought this way to wound his reputation.

Or rather it is moſt likely that ſome vnletter'd fellow, ſome ſharking companion, lighting vpon an old motheaten Pamphlet, which hee thought to be ſome great treaſure, and hard to be come by; and agreeing with a Sordid Bookeſeller to get it reprinted; thought it beſt to put ſome mans name of note before it, that ſo their gaines, which they gaped for, might come in the faſter by the ſale. And this laſt (howſoeuer the other two coniectures goe, for there may be more in it then this alone) they that haue had to doe, and enquire into the matter, haue found to bee moſt certaine and true.
            In the meane, who would not lament to ſee what a miſerable caſe we are now adayes brought vnto, when ſuch baſe fellowes as theſe, that neuer had any thing to doe with learning, nor honeſtie neither, ſhall take vpon them to iudge what Bookes may benefite the people, and deſerue to bee publiſhed? Vnhappy Theologie! which muſt be

made a refuge for Runagates; and, whether ſhee will or no, be forced to patronize the baſe ſeruice of ſuch diſhoneſt Mountebankes, that doe ſo ſhamefully proſtitute her to their gaine and filthie lucre. The fault whereof, it is a griefe to ſee, how in a maner it comes from the very people themſelues, who hauing once got it by the end, that there is no ſmal religion in making long diſcourſes, and in oſtentation of much reading, gape after ſuch nouell Pamphlets as faſt as euer the Athenians did after newes. And ſo no maru
                  •
               ile if wee haue euery day ſuch dry kickſes & abortiue broods ſent vs into the world, when there are ſo many to buy them vp
                  •
                as children doe babies and toyes. But to make it no wonder, that theſe Impoſtors were in ſuch hope to couſen and deceiue the vnskilfull multitude at eaſe; is it not beyond all the degrees of impudence, that they ſhould goe about to make Them Patrons and witneſſes of their fraud, whom they ſhould much rather haue

feared to be the Reuengers & inſt Puniſhers of it? Lord! what a licentious age doe wee liue in! that ſuch a lurking obſcure fellow (for hee is famous and knowen for nothing but villany) ſhould dare to inſcribe his Booke, which hee knew to be but forg'd and counterfeit, to our moſt Noble and Pious Prince, beſides many other great Lords, and all in hope of reward and gaine! But to let paſſe this iuggling knaue, that ſets vs foorth his wares and toyes with ſuch a vaunting kind of language, and to come vnto the Booke it ſelfe.
            Certainly I ſuppoſe there is no learned man, ſpecially to whom Caſaubon or his Writings were not altogether vnknowen, that can bee ſo ſenceleſſe or groſſe, but vpon the firſt reading of this Booke, hee will preſently both perceiue and deteſt the fraud of theſe cheating companions. And therefore had the Booke come into their hands onely that were able to iudge of ſuch matters, and to diſcerne trueth frō falſhood, I might

haue ſaued all this labour. But inaſmuch as the Booke came forth in Engliſh, and was ſnatched vp ſo faſt by the vnlearned multitude, and is now by their raſh iudgement ſo much commended and approoued; I haue heere briefly vndertaken the examination thereof, both to rectifie the ignorant, and to vindicate my Father from ſuſpicion of impietie; that ſo at laſt the vizard being pulled off the Pamphlet, it may appeare to all, as it is, in its owne naturall likeneſſe.
            And firſt I muſt ſeriouſly confeſſe, that for the originall Author of the Booke, I neither know him, nor euer heard the leaſt rumour of him, what hee was, 
                  
                     •
                  t
                     •
                  r an albus, French or Engliſh, or whether he be yet aboue ground or no; leſt haply ſome might ſuſpect, that I vented any priuate malice of mine owne, while in defending of my Father, I ſeeme to write ſomething ſharpely againſt one whom I know not.
            For his Religion, I thinke it will ſatiſfie a great many, and be enough for his

commendation too, to ſay, hee was no Papiſt, but rather a fierce enemy to them all. Indeed this may be enough for them, that thinke a man preſently right and orthodoxe enough, if hee doeth but once profeſſe himſelfe an Aduerſarie to Poperie; it being their cuſtome to meaſure the integritie and ſoundneſſe of a mans Religion by his hatred againſt Papiſts onely. And it is to bee feared, leſt that the Booke, being written againſt the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, as the Title of it pretends, becauſe I neither approoue the Booke, nor acknowledoe it to be my Fathers, both Father and Sonne, as men taken napping, be by ſome Pu
                  •
               itans reputed for errant Papiſts. But howſoeuer it were a fault, to giue any occaſion of ſcandall vnto the weakeſt members in the Church, yet the loue of trueth muſt more preuaile with me to vndertake her defence, then the prauitie of other mens iudgements to deterre me from it. In my opinion he defined vertue well, that ſaid it was the meane betweene two extreme

vices, which is not onely true in Morall and Practicall, but in ſome Intellectuall vertues alſo; of which kinde the right apprehenſion of Trueth is. And therefore it is no marueile, if they, which take that way in matters of Religion, doe oppoſe themſelues againſt two extremes, and haue two extremes oppoſed againſt them. Yet hee that keepes this middle courſe, howſoeuer he may perhaps differ in opinion from either ſide, yet in charitie he may be vnited vnto both. And for no other cauſe is hee more maligned by the hot-ſpurres on either part, then for ſeeking to procure peace and concord betwixt them, and for doing his beſt endeauour to make vp the great ſchiſme and rent of the Church, that againe wee might come to be all one body. Which miſery an olde Father was wont long agoe to lament in theſe words, that may be very well applied to our times.

            For the Papiſts, I haue nothing to ſay to them now. But I haue heere to doe with ſuch kind of men, who ſtriuing to runne as farre from Papiſts as they can, haue alſo vnaduiſedly runne withall beyond the bounds of Truth. Theſe are the Men, that with incredible pride and arrogancy deſpiſe all Antiquity; that moſt ſuperciliouſly contemne the ancient and holy Fathers, that ſtudie all they can how to abrogate and abandon all the ancient Conſtitutions of the Church; and in the meane while, that arrogate to themſelues a power of making what Lawes they liſt, of appointing Ceremonies at their pleaſure, and of bringing in ſuch a diſcipline, which the Chriſtians of olde neuer heard of, as if they had be
                  •
               ne created the only perpetuall Dictators

and Gouernours of the Church of Chriſt. And though they haue no regard at all of any publique tranquillitie, refuſing to giue way but to the leaſt thing that may make for the peace and vnitie of Chriſtians, yet neuertheles they would faine beare vp their credit, and for a colour of their bad intents, make vs beleeue they are wondrous zealous men. Of which ſort of men that he was one, whoſoeuer was the Author of this Booke, which theſe Impoſtors haue publiſhed vnder Iſ. Caſa
                     •
                  bons name, and that he was no meane one neither, but a chiefe champion among them, I thinke no body will make queſtion, that will but runne ouer the booke, and of thoſe infinite places which prooue the ſame moſt plainely, will but a little more narrowly marke a few. There being I ſuppoſe ſcarce any writing extant in this kind, which doeth more clearely and euidently argue, what an inſolent, peruerſe, and raſh Author it had. A man would verely thinke that hee was one,

who
                  •
                had proclaimed open warre and defiance to all Antiquitie, or one that being ſtarke-ſtaring mad with noueltie and fury, would abandon all the ancient Cuſtomes and Conſtitutions of our Forefathers.
            The Booke indeed by the Title is pretended to be written againſt Papiſts, but in effect it prooues as aduerſe to the Primitiue, as to the Popiſh Church. And whereas the Church of England, cutting off ſuch corruptions as crept in vpon her in declining ages, hath retained many of the Sacred Rites and Ceremonies which the ancient Church had, yet ſhe is alſo cunningly ſtricken at through the Papiſts ſides, with ſo much the more danger, by how much the more craft and cloſe ſubtiltie it is done.
            Therefore let this be the firſt Argument of all the reſt, to prooue, that Caſaubon neither was, nor could be the Author of this Booke. For who was it that euer reuerenced the gray haires of Antiquitie more then hee? Who euer, without

iniuring the holy Scriptures, 
                  •
               ſteemed more highly of the ancient Fathers? And for the Church of England, what ſhould I neede to ſpeake of i
                  •
               ? whoſe Doctrine and Diſcipline, Rites and Ceremonies hee did ſo much approoue and embrace, that hee could neuer ſeeme to himſelfe to haue commended and magnified it enough. Though there were none of his workes and writings left behind him, out of which it might be gathered and demonſtrated what his mind was herein, yet there be many graue and religious men ſtill liuing, whom I could call to witneſſe, how often they haue heard him profeſſe and declare at large, that he was thus affected. But there will be no neede of that, ſeeing his owne Bookes are euery where extant to confirme it. For howſoeuer hee had neuer any occaſion offered him purpoſely and ex profeſſo to handle this Argument, yet ſeeing all his Workes that belong to matters Eccleſiaſticall and Diuine, haue nothing in them, not onely contrary, or

auerſe from the vſe and cuſtomes of this Church, but what is altogether agreeable to the Canons and Conſtitutions of the ſam
                  •
                and which, as occaſion is offered, doe euer and anon defend them; the intelligent Reader will eaſily perceiue, how willingly hee ſubmitted himſelfe vnto the Forme thereof, & reſted wholly content with it.
            
               And for this purpoſe there are not wanting moſt certaine proofes and teſtimonies occurring in many places of his writings, which will be enough to ſtop vp the mouthes of the moſt impudent gain-ſayers. As when in his Preface to his Eccleſiaſticall Exercitations, written to his Sacred Maieſtie, he ſaith, Qui Eccleſiam habeas in tuis Regnis, partim iam olim ità institutam, partim magnis tuis laboribus ità inſtauratam, vt ad florētis quondam Eccleſiae formam nulla hodiè propius accedat, quàm tua, inter uel exceſſu, vel defectu peccantes mediam uiam ſecuta.

By which moderation the Church of ENGLAND hath got this ſpeciall aduantage, that euen ſuch as enuy her happineſſe, are neuertheleſſe oftentimes conſtrained to magnifie her in compariſon of others. Beſides &c. Whereunto theſe words agree in his Epiſtle to Cardinall Perron, written, though in his Maieſties name, yet according to his owne ſence and meaning; Certò, clarè ac liquidò ſibi conſtare, ſi notae 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

plaine and manifeſt unto him, how for matters eſſentiall, and truly neceſſary to ſaluation, or belonging alſo to the beauty and decency of the Church, there was (God be thanked) none in all the world to be found, which came neerer to the faith and face of the ancient Catholike Church, &c.
            It wil not be amiſſe here to ſet downe his iudgement about ſome certain Rites and Ceremonies, which as occaſion ſerued, he wrote and inſerted into his Ephemerides, from whence what hee thought of all others in that kinde, may be eaſily coniectured.

Thankes bee to thee, O Lord, that I was this day admitted vnto thy Holy Table, and made partaker of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Church of England, the Forme of which Adminiſtration, hauing read it ouer yeſterday, I did highly approoue and commend aboue that cuſtome which others vſe.
            And not onely theſe things which concerne the Church of England, but thoſe alſo wherein hee had to doe with

our Aduerſaries alone doe ſufficiently argue for his defence. Euen by his whole manner and genius of writing euery body may knowe that the booke is none of his. For who cannot tell, with what great moderation and mildneſſe Caſaubon was euer wont to treat of Controuerſies in Religion? inſomuch that many prepoſterous Puritanes, out of their ignorant and mad zeale, did blame him for it, and from thence tooke occaſion to ſuſpect him more then they had reaſo
                  •
                to doe. But this was the way that hee tooke; and hee perſwaded himſelfe it was the beſt and ſafeſt way that could bee taken, both for the finding out of trueth, and the redreſſe of error; to follow that path which meekneſſe and moderation either led him, or went along with him in, without all affection or partiality either way; ſuppoſing that ſuch as tooke any other courſe, did put pace in a dangerous and ſlippery path, and put others further out of their way that were gone aſtray one from another.

Now if a man ſhould run through the whole rout of Nouellers, and diligently make inquiry into their writings, I think there could not one bee found for furie, and malice, and b
                  •
               tterneſſe againſt his Aduerſaries, to bee compared with this Counterfeit-Caſaubon; then whom neuer was any man more childiſhly and fondly in loue with his owne fancie, or more bent to his faction. It is but a ſmall matter, that he hath rail'd a little more bitterly then became a modeſt man, againſt ſuch things as were worthy of blame; but ſo infinitely to bely his Aduerſaries, and to put ſuch forged crimes and calumnies vpon them, was vnſufferable, ſpecially in ſuch an vndertaker for the Trueth of Chriſt. Such manner of dealing with Aduerſaries, though it may be pleaſing to ſome hotte fiery Zelotes, whom learning neuer taught any modeſty, yet wiſer men cannot but condemne it, as being fitter to ſpoyle, then to helpe or defend a good cauſe. For if there be

                ſtrict Lawes prouided againſt

ſuch colluding pleaders, that pretending to helpe a man, do of purpoſe leaue out that which ſhould moſt make for his cauſe, and bring nothing but falſe allegations for his defence, ſo to betray his right to his Aduerſaries
                  •
                what is to bee done with ſuch vndertakers of Controuerſi
                  •
               s in Religion, that either of purpoſe, or through groſſe ignorance let paſſe thoſe Arguments that be ſolid, and of greateſt moment, and come in with ſuch idle poore reaſons, as euery childe may anſwer and blow away? Ought not the ſame Law (when the caſe is the ſame) to be made againſt theſe men, as betrayers of an honeſt and good cauſe? What readier way then theirs can be imagined wholly to alienate our Aduerſaries mindes from vs, that being ouercome with the truth on our parts, began ſomewhat to incline vnto vs? Caius Fabritius is highly commended vnto vs by the writers of old times, for his vertue and magnanimity, in ſcorning to accept of that victory in a doubtfull battell, which

was offered him by the perfidie of a trecherous fellow. And is it not a ſhame now adayes, that Chriſtians contending with Chriſtians about the Trueth of Faith, ſhould vſe leſſe faith and conſcience one towards another, then the Pagans themſelues were wont to doe, who regarded nothing but their owne wordly praiſe and honour?
            Can there then be any body ſo iniurious to Caſaubon, or ſo quite bereaued of his owne iudgement, as to thinke theſe things, that ſmell only of a furious Sycophant, and a moſt impudent Calumniator, could come from him? Frō him, I ſay, Whoſe mildneſſe and moderation in matters of Religion is ſo euident in all his writings, that to take any paines to prooue it, were but to waſte time, and to light a candle in the Sunne.
            And howſoeuer it befits not the modeſtie of a ſonne to contend about the learning of his Father; yet I hope I may haue leaue, without the breach of good manners, to ſay that hee was no meere

Blocke, or ſuch a one as had no good learning at all 
                  •
               n him; which, let but be once granted mee, and I doubt not of the good ſucceſſe I ſhall haue, in vindicating his name and eſtimation from theſe Huckſters handes, that put this booke vpon him. A booke which is ſo full of exceſſiue ignorance and ſtupiditie, that whereas euery thing in it (except a few ſcraps taken from others) argue a moſt vnlearned writer; there are many things beſides, which I wonder how they could come from a man that was ſound in his ſenſes: if yet he is to be thought ſound in his ſenſes, whom this peſtilent madde puritaniſme hath once poſſeſſed.
            But I ſuppoſe the Reader expects, that for the better confirmation of what we ſay, we ſhould produce ſome Examples out of the Booke it ſ
                  •
               lfe, concerning theſe things, wherewith we haue all this while charged the Author of it. It remaines therefore, that we briefly runne the Booke ouer, rather pointing at the

places, then vndertaking any refutation of them.
            IN the firſt part of his Booke hee reckons Pag. 2, 3, &c. 8, 9, 21. vp all ſuch things, which either happened by occaſion, or were directly ordained by God in the olde Law, hauing ſome myſticall or typicall ſignification in them; as the Trees of Life and Death, of Knowledge of Good & Euill; the Rainebow; the Feaſt of vnleauened Bread; the cloudie Pillar that went before the Iſraelites in the day; the flame of Fire that guided them in the night; the diuiſion of the Red Sea; the heauenly Manna; the water that guſhed out of the Rocke; Oblations and Sacrifices of diuers ſorts; the Temple of Ieruſalem; the Prieſts veſtments; the water of clenſing, &c. And all theſe he will haue to been no leſſe truely and properly called Sacraments of the olde Teſtament, then Circumciſion and the Paſſeouer were; in place whereof were inſtituted thoſe two Sacraments of the new Teſtament, Baptiſme, and the Supper of the Lord.

I am not ignorant what a large ſignification the word Sacrament hath; but neuer (that I could learne) were all theſe promiſcuouſly accounted, and reckoned vp among the number of Sacraments by the Fathers; and while I weigh this mans words a little better, I finde by moſt certaine confequence, that his meaning and purpoſe was, in making all Sacred Signes to be true Sacraments, withall to make vs beleeue, that the Sacraments of the New Teſtament are nothing elſe but meere naked Signes and Figures. Neither is there any other meaning to be collected from him in all his paſſages about the holy Sacrament of the Euchariſt. For howſoeuer he would ſometimes ſeeme to be farre of another minde, when hee vſeth the words, really and truely; yet he applies them no otherwiſe to the Sacred Symboles of the Supper, then hee doeth to any of thoſe Shadowes and Figures of the olde Law; acknowledging no power in them of really exhibiting, but of ſignifying onely, as

pag. 36. or really ſignifying, at moſt, as pag. 81. vpon which ground, that is to ſay, that there is no more vertue in the Euchariſt, then in thoſe Signes, he thinkes hee hath moſt learnedly and ſtrongly confuted the new opinion of Tranſubſtantiation, (a conceit otherwiſe moſt abſurd and groſſe,) becauſe forſooth there was no Tranſubſtantiation in the Pag. 85, 86. Tree of knowledge of Good and Euill, none in the Manna, or in the Rocke that flowed with water, or in the brazen Serpent, &c. As if it were not eaſie to anſwere our Aduerſaries truely out of S. Auguſtines owne wordes. Prima Sacramenta

In his third Chapter, going about to Pag. 10. 11, &c. ſhew, how from time to time, the Signes & Sacrifices ofthe old Law were depraued, and ſubiect to corruption, without any iudgement, or diſcretion at all, hee reckons vs vp a number of ſins and offences, of a farre different nature; which neuertheleſſe he will needs haue properly to belong vnto the Sacraments; as the Loathing of Manna, and the Peoples murmurring that followed; the ſinne of Achan; the impiety of the ſonnes of Heli; the raſh attempt of Uzzah, and others the like; among which Iephte's vow, and Gedeon's garment are numbred for corruptions of Sacraments. And hither hee referres that of 2. Kings 17. 17. Pag. 15. Where the Iſraelites made their children to paſſe through the fire, which this fellow calls Purgatorie Fire, and ſaith, that from it was deriued the opinion of the Alcoraniſts and Mahumetans at this day for Purgatory: meaning by his Alcoraniſts, the Papiſts of our times. For ſo hee calls them elſe-where, them and their Ritualls

               Durand's Alcoran, Titelman's Alcoran, &c.
            
            In his Seuenth Chapter, hee cites vs his Eccleſiaſticall Commentaries, and Pag. 50. hee ſends vs vnto them againe. Tis very well. Still haue wee the aduantage, & euery where matter enough to detect the fraud of theſe Impoſtors. For whoſe ſoeuer theſe ſame Commentaries be, ſure I am, they bee none of Caſaubon's. Hee neuer publiſhed, neuer wrote any Eccleſiaſtical Commentaries. But I am afraid leſt theſe Commentaries In his Epiſtle to the Reader. and thoſe of Elaſopolitanus, bee twinnes, out of which the Author of this booke himſelfe confeſſeth, he had euery thing to make vs vp this Pamphlet, ſuch as it is. What theſe Commentaries of Elaſopolitan are, I thinke no body yet euer knew, or is like to know, being at leaſt ſo vnknowne and vnheard of, as the very name of the man ſeemed ſtrange and monſtrous to all learned mens eares that I could meete withall.
            In the ſame Chapter, among the ſuperſtitious

Ceremonies of Baptiſme heretofore brought into the Church, he Pag. 27. 28. numbreth vp Chriſme, Exſufflation, and Exorciſmes; which though they were not vndeſeruedly taken away by the Church of England, when they began to bee abuſed vnto ridiculous ſuperſtition; yet inaſmuch as they be knowne to haue been of very great Antiquity, it was not the part of a modeſt man to raile vpon them for abominable things, ſpecially as they were vſed in the Primitiue Church. Certainely the old godly Fathers, S. Cyrill, S. Ba
                     •
                  il, S. Ambroſe, S. Auguſtine and others (a little better Doctors of Religion and Piety, I trow, then our new vpſtart Zelotes) would neuer haue admitted or allowed them, if, as this man affirmes, they had been firſt inuented to adulterate the true vſe and prime Inſtitution of Baptiſme. And for Caſaubon it is not likely that hee would euer haue giuen any ſuch cenſure of theſe Ceremonies againſt the manner and cuſtome of the ancient Fathers, whom how much he reuerenced,

hee hath elſewhere made knowne in matters of greater moment.
            But wee muſt not here let paſſe this one moſt notorious example of the ſenceleſſe ſtupidity and malignitie both of this lewd and idle writer. Wherefore Pag. 28.O you Miſsalians (ſaith the man) haue you foiſted in oyles into the holy Sacrament of Baptiſme, imitating herein the here
                     •
                  ie of Marcus and Marcoſus, who commanded that Infants to bee baptized ſhould bee anointed? In his Margin hee ſends vs to Epiphanius. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . There was one Marcus (ſaith Epiphanius) of whom the Marcoſians were ſo called. Now who would not wonder what a monſtrous blinde bayard this fellow is, to make vs proper names of denominatiues? as if a man ſhould ſay, there were two certaine famous Heretikes called Arrius and Arrianus. But what is the madneſſe of the Marcoſians to the ancient cuſtome of the Orthodoxe Fathers? The Marcoſian Heretikes vſed not their oyle for an indifferent Ceremony in Baptiſme, but made

the vertue and efficacy of the Sacrament to depend vpon it, inſomuch, that ſome of them neuer baptized their yong beginners, if they were once anointed after their owne faſhion with oyle. 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , ſaith Epiphanius there, Some of them thinke Baptiſme ſuperfluous.
            
            A little after hee doth malapertly inueigh Pag. 29. againſt the ancient Biſhops, as if they had permitted women to baptize: which is a meere falſe tale. Tertul. de vel. virg. Nonpermittitur mulieri in Eccleſiâ loqui, ſednec docere, nec tingere, &c. It is not permitted to a woman for to ſpeake in the Church, or to teach, or to Baptize, &c. In a caſe of extreme neceſſitie the very ſame Father ſaith, that Laymen might doe it. Wherupon the Church of England, howſoeuer it alloweth not women or Laymen to baptize, yet the laſt being once done, when neceſſity ſo requireth, it doth not beleeue it to be void, or to haue no account mad

               Pag. 30. Then in his Eighth Chapter, as if hee had all this while thought himſelfe too modeſt, he begins with open face, as they ſay, and a tongue paſt all ſhame to flie vpon the venerable face of Antiquity. And firſt of all, ſee how brauely he giues the onſet. Wherefore when errors came in and preuailed euen in the Apoſtles times, Let no man hereafter thinke it ſtrange, that the Apoſtles Succeſſors frō time to time adulterated the true vſe, and rites of the holy Sacraments. As if it were all one, that there were ſome Heretikes in the Apoſtles times, and that the Apoſtles Succeſſors were Heretikes themſelues. No body will deny but that there haue beene Hereſies from the beginning of the Church, or at leaſt haue

ſprung vp not long after: But if the heads of the Church, immediatly ſucceeding the Apoſtles were tainted, what hope is there, that the reſt of the body, ſpecially in after ages may bee ſound? Wherefore that which hee repeates by Pag. 32. and by againe, w
                  •
                will not care to grant him, that there were from the beginning of the Church many and infinite corruptions crept in
                  •
                but, by his leaue, none of them were receiued by the Church, or approoued by the godly Biſhops, and ſound members of the ſame. It is the open profeſſion of the Church of England, that ſhee doth wholly aſſent, and firmely adhere to the doctrine of the firſt foure hundred yeeres, and more. That which the holy Fathers of thoſe times deliuered, and taught with common conſent, ſhee willingly imbracet
                  •
                That which they did not teach, ſhee forbids to be now taught vnto the people, as neceſſary for them to beleeue; which is apparant by that goldē Canon ofhers (as Caſaubon was wont to call it)

made in a Synode Anno 1571. and ſet forth together with the Articles of Religion, and confirmed by ſubſcription of all: whereby all Preachers and Paſtours In the Chapter of Preachers. are bound, That they ſhould neuer teach any thing, as matter of Faith religiouſly to be obſerued, but that which is agreeable to the doctrine of the Olde and New Testament, and is collected out of the ſame doctrine by the Ancient Fathers, and Catholike Biſhops of the Church.
            
            But a Gods name, what are theſe ſo great corruptions of the Primitiue Church, which this ſame ſwinger of Antiquitie hath made ſuch a ſtirre withall? Pag. 31. 
               Next and immediatly (ſo hee ſayes) after the Apoſtles times there was a contention about a certaine Compromiſsion of dayes, when this holy Sacrament was to be celebrated, and then they began to make Holy-dayes, and appoint dayes of fasting, &c. That there were any dayes appointed for the celebration of the Euchariſt in the Primitiue Church, or that there aroſe any contention among the Biſhops about it, I

thinke is this idle mans fancie onely, and that no ſufficient teſtimonie can be brought to prooue it. For the innocencie and puritie of theſe firſt ages was ſuch, that as the ancient Fathers and other writers doe witneſſe, not onely any day, but euery day was appropriated to this Sacred Celebration; the Chriſtians then for the moſt part neuer miſſing a day, but they did communicate. A long while after, when deuotion began to waxe cold, there grew a neceſſitie of making Lawes, to meet with the peoples contempt of ſo great a bleſſing. Then were times appointed, chiefly to tie thoſe that were ſo negligent and auerſe of themſelues. But this dull Aſſe, liuing perhaps among ſuch as thought it religion enough to communicate once a yeere, whatſoeuer he had read about the Feaſt of Eaſter, which was a long time variouſly obſerued, hee applied moſt fondly vnto the time of receiuing the Lords Supper, as if that had beene the onely appointed day for the celebration

of that Sacrament. But (ſo hee goeth on) the Apoſtles left us nothing in writing about Faſting, and Feaſt dayes. But ſo would Caſaubon neuer haue written in a matter not meerely belonging to Faith, who hath often admired and approoued of that Rule which S. Auguſtine giueth vs. S. Aug. de bapt. contra Donat. l. 4. cap. 24.
                
               Quod univerſa tenet Eccleſia, nec Concilijs inſtitutum, ſed ſemper retentum eſt, non niſi Apoſtolicâ authoritate traditum rectiſsimè creditur. That which the uniuerſall Church holdeth, which is not defined by Councels, but hath beene alwayes retained and uſed, we doe rightly beleeue to be a Tradition of Apoſtolicall authoritie. And for the obſeruation of the Hebdomadaſancta, that Great and Holy weeke before Eaſter, hee freely profeſſeth his mind in his Exercitations. Exerc. pag. 
                     •
                  71. 
               Ego ſanctiſsimam illam conſuetudinem iam inde ab Apoſtolorum temporibus initia habuiſſe, aut non multò poſt facilè crediderim. I doe eaſily beleeue, that either in the Apoſtles times, or not long after, this most holy Custome had its beginning.
            
            In the ſame Chapter, hee tells vs that

Pope Alexander the firſt of that name, who was the fifth from S. Peter, (as Euſebius writes in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, lib. 4. c. 1.) and one that was crowned with Martyrdom, as other Authors teſtifie, that this Alexander going about Pag. 33. to reforme the Goſpel of Chriſt, was the firſt that inuented the mingling of water and wine in the Euchariſt. Concerning which cuſtome, what the practiſe of the ancient Church was, and what S. Cyprian, and S. Auguſtine ſay of it, they that know any Antiquitie cannot be ignorant.
            Againe hee tells vs that from this Cuſtome their Abuſe ſprung vp, who ſteeped 
               Pag. 35. 
               the bread of the holy Supper in the blood of young infants, and ſo celebrated the Sacrament. What a moſt deteſtable wickednes of a man is this, to ioyne the monſtrous impietie of lewd miſcreants, (that went for Chriſtians indeede among the vnskilfull multitude, but were nothing leſſe) & the vniuerſall practiſe of Chriſts Church together! and to aſcribe the

wickedneſſe of heretickes, to innocent and harmeleſſe men! So the Pagans of olde, what villanie ſoeuer any baſe fellow, that was but thought to be a Chriſtian, had done, they were wont to lay it vpon the true Chriſtians themſelues, as the Writers of thoſe elder ages haue ſo often complained. But ſo true is it, that this wicked bloodſhed of infants ſprang from the Cuſtome of the Churches mingling water with wine, whereof hee makes Alexander to haue beene the firſt Inuenter, as that many of better authoritie then hee, fetch the beginning of it from Simon Magus, who was a whole hundred yeeres elder then Alexander. And it was this Alexander alſo, whom he makes to be the Reuiuer of Iewiſh Ceremonies in the Church, and the firſt Inuenter of unleauened bread to be vſed in the Euchariſt. A wonder the man ſhould be no more afraid of the Allobrogicall Conſiſtory, the Tribunall ſeat at Geneua, where the ſame bread, according as the olde cuſtome was, is vſed at this day.

               on: yet for this hee is to bee commended, though for nothing elſe, that he doeth ſo ingenuouſly acknowledge his good Benefactors. But how well this kinde of writing agrees with Caſaubon, to depend wholly vpon new Writers, and neglect the olde, let them ſay, that are fit iudges in theſe matters.
            But it made altogether for his purpoſe, to explicate the Paynim Rites and Ceremonies of the Romans, frō whence hee vndertaketh to deduce the whole Maſſe, and to conuince it of Paganiſme. For his vndertaking, let honeſt and moderate

men iudge how laudable it is. I know hee is not the firſt, or at leaſt the onely man that hath attempted it; there haue beene thoſe that would needes fetch the whole Religion of the Papiſts, both in Faith and Ceremonies, from Turks & Pagans. But ſure I am, that any ſuch thought was very odious to Caſaubon, who was neither ſo inept to beleeue any ſuch thing himſelfe, nor ſo malignant to perſwade other men to it. Which I ſpeake not, as if I meant to excuſe the many and deteſtable ſuperſtitions of Popery: no ſuch matter. But it is one thing, faithfully to reduce errors and corruptions vnto their prime beginnings, which many excellent men haue with great felicitie vndertaken; and another, ſhamefully to detort, and bitterly to exaggerate all things, for the bringing of them into hatred; which the Author of this Booke hath moſt impudently done, aboue all others that euer belaboured themſelues in this kind. And ſeeing the Church of England hath retained many

things in her publike Liturgie, that were before in the Romane Miſſall, the one cannot altogether be accuſed of Paganiſme, without the opprobrious iniury of the other.
            But wee ſaid euen now, and it is too manifeſt, that this Pamphlet is in moſt things repugnant to the Church of England. We will briefly point at ſome of them.

abſurdities, he is not onely ſo impudent to affirme, but he will needs betray and ſhew ſuch great ignorance al

               o to confirme them with reaſons; that a man cannot tell, at what he ſhould wonder moſt, his ignorance, or his impudence. As for example, firſt Pag. 67. bringing that which wee alledged laſt of all concerning Diſpenſations, and auouching them to haue come from the Romans, he ſaith, Ouer theſe Benefices the high Pontife had uſurped a power to giue diſpenſation to whom he would, for the holding of two together, as in I itus Liuius it is related of Fabius Maximus, who by a diſpenſation helde two Benefices, when hee was created Pontife, more then 200. before the Incarnation of 
                     •
                  eſus Christ. Theſe things to be ſpoken by a Pagan after the manner of our own times, who would not marueile at? But in Liuie there is no ſuch matter. Hee ſpeakes not one word of a Diſpenſation. That Fab. Maximus of whom Liuie here writes, was neuer any Pontife neither, but died when he was young. Indeed

his Father, Q. Fab. the elder was ſaid to haue had two Prieſthoods, as they call'd them, of two kinds nothing like one another
                  •
                but not two places, or two preferments in the ſame kinde of Prieſthood. Forſooth, the ſame man was Augur and Pontife too. And not to tell you what Plutarch ſaith, that the name Augur was no title of Magiſtracie or dignity, but of Art and knowledge onely, Liui's words are; Eodem anno Quin. Fabius moritur, &c. Augur in eius locum inauguratus eſt Quin. Fabius Max filius; in eiuſdem locum P

            But this is nothing to the reſt of his abſurdities: whereof that wee may giue ſome taſte, let vs ſee a little how he deriueth the Maſſe from Numa Pompilius.
            
            
               Pag. 48. 49. For the name of the Maſſe, hee likes

not of them, that deriue it from Daniel's

               Maozim, and thinkes it may be much better deduced from the Hebrue Meſſa, which word, hee ſaith, wee haue in 4. King. cap. 11. ſignifying Conculcation. Indeed in the 11. Chap. uer. 6. wee haue 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               Maſſah, which the Septuagint tooke for a proper name, and interpreted 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , which the French Tranſlation alſo following, hath retained the word Meſe in the Text; and yet noted the diuerſe interpretation of Irruption and uaſtation in the Margin: from whence this Aſſe tooke his Conculcation. But if the word be taken in that ſence of Irruption or Conculcation, as hee ſpeakes, the Root will not be 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               Maſah, but

               Naſah: neither will the word Maſſah ſignifie irruption, but, from irruption, the praepoſition being ioyned with the Noune, as the manner of the Hebrues is.
            With the like frenzie doth he deriue vs Miſſel from Miſſeol 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , which doth not ſignifie Hell, but, out of Hell.

               ymologies of the Maſſe,
               
otherwiſe good enough, he thinkes not therefore fit to be admitted, becauſe the Author of the Maſſe, Numa Pompilius, vnderſtood no Hebrew at all: and thereupon he concludeth, that it is a Latine word made by Numa himſelfe, who firſt of all, forſooth, appointed, thoſe words, Pag. 49. & 72. 
               Ite Miſſa eſt, to bee proclaimed vnto the people, when their Sacrifices were at an end. Reader, canſt thou imagine, that this fellow had either any ſhame or conſcience in him to write ſuch things as theſe? Hee ſhould haue produced one of the Ancient Heathen Authors, at leaſt, that had euer vſed the word Miſsa for a Subſtantiue, a name vſuall in their Sacrifices.
            And with as little ſhame is that written of him, when to prooue that the Turkes doe ſo much eſteem of the Maſse, hee deduceth the Arabicke wordes of Mecca, which is a Townes name, and Meſulmanos, which is, Peacemakers, or faithfull and Orthodoxe, and Meſgid, which is as much to ſay as the place of adoration,
               
that is, a Temple, being all corruptly called Meſſa, Meſelman, and Meſsites, all theſe from the word Maſſe.
            
            Such kinde of ſtuffe it is that he ſaith, the old Chriſtians borrowed their Title of Pop
                     •

In the ſame place hee dreames how the Prieſts were called

               Halicar. interprets to be the Flamines, and ſaith they were ſo called from the faſhion of their Bonnets, or the Crownes themſelues that they vſed to weare.
            
               ibid. With the like liberty of lying hee affirmes, that the Romans were wont to call that white garment, which they vſed in their Pagan ſolemnities an Albe; and this moſt abſurd and ſhamefull fancie of his owne he aſcribes to that learned Author Alexander ab Alexandro, in whoſe worke there is no ſuch matter to bee found. And among other Rituall Pag. 52. writers, he brings vs in Philo the Iew to ſpeake of this Albe of the Papiſts. For after hee hath done with the myſticall interpretations, that Titleman, and Gabr. Biel giue of it, he addeth, That Philo in his booke of Dreames, ſubtilly deuiſeth, how the Albe ſignifies the moſt reſplendent light of the Deity, which hee calls Ens.

                that is, as the interpreter renders it, Wee will now explaine the third and moſt perfect colour that is called Alba, or white; which hee doth allegorically expound of the Linnen Garment, that was made of the pureſt fine threed, and vſed to be put vpon the High-Prieſt. Now becauſe all this ſeemed to agree ſomewhat with the Papiſts Albe, the man, being not well in his wits, tooke thoſe words of the Interpreter, Quae Alba nominatur; which is called the white colour, as if Philo had ſpoken it of the Prieſts garment. But that you might not maruell how Philo ſhould come to talke of a Popiſh veſtment, you ſhall preſently heare, how hee was acquainted with the Miſſalia

For hauing reckoned vs vp moſt of the veſtments which the Papiſts vſe in their ſolemne performance of diuine Rites, Pag. 54. 
               To theſe (ſaies he) Philo the Iew addes a Mitre to declare the Miſſalians Royall Diadem. In the place which is cited, Philo treateth of the High Prieſts Mytre among the Iewes: ſo that with this fellow the Prieſts of the Iewes & the Miſſaliſts are all one: and then, inaſmuch as he doth el

               Labarum, the name of a Banner, made famous by Conſtantine, but before Chriſt's time (as farre as wee can finde by the bookes of ancient Authors yet extant) neuer heard of, hee tells vs, was knowne by that name to the old Romans, yea, and as it were older then Rome it ſelfe, he fetcheth it from Antenor of Troy.

For who was euer ſo mad to ſay, that Numa Pompilius celebrated Maſſe 700. yeeres before Chriſt was borne? and yet this Scribler affirmes it almoſt in euery page. And therefore when hee ſpeakes of the Prieſts which Numa conſtituted, hee calls them Maſse-Prieſts; 
               Pag. 55. and in his 13. Chap. alleadging the place of Blondus, concerning the maner of the Pagan Rites in their Sacrifices, that which Blondus ſpeakes of the Gentiles, Dijs ſuperis ſacra facturi, about to ſacrifice vnto the Gods, this man turnes, who were about to ſay Maſse.
            
            In his 15. Chapter he ſaith, that Prieſts

                   of Numa the Magician; for that it was the cuſtome of the heathen Idolaters alſo, to looke heauily, and confeſse themſelues before their offering of Sacrifice. In the cuſtome of Confeſſing, which otherwiſe no body, that is in his right minde, can find fault withall, if the Papiſts haue admitted any thing worthy of blame, I am not hee that will excuſe it. But if that bee their fault onely, that the Heathens vſed ſome ſuch matter, what ſhall be free from reprehenſion, euen in the moſt pure and vncorrupt Religion? For it is well knowne alſo, that the Prieſts vnder the old Lawe did firſt offer Sacrifice for their owne ſinnes; which I thinke no body will ſay the Iſraelites tooke from the heathen Idolaters. And let but a man now denie this fellow, that whatſoeuer matters in Religion are common to vs with the Gentiles, bee in all haſte to be caſt away, the whole frame of his booke will preſently fall aſunder: for this is the onely foundation whereon ſo many vnſauory

diſputes, ſo many fooliſh, vniuſt, and falſe accuſations doe reſt. What the minde of the Fathers in this behalfe was, may be ſhowne by many of their owne teſtimonies. Quoniam idol

As we are not (ſaith hee) to despiſe or deteſt the virginity of holy Nunnes becauſe there haue beene ueſtall uirgins alſo, &c. To that purpoſe Tertullian de praeſcr. aduerſ. haeret. doth abundantly demonſtrate, that the Gentiles had ſome things of neere affinitie with the Ceremonies that wee vſe in the chiefe myſteries of our Religion. And ſo farre were the old Chriſtians from refuſing all the Rites and cuſtomes of

the heathen, that as far as pietie would ſuffer them, they did prudently condeſcend and apply themſelues thereunto, the more eaſily to winne them in matters of greater moment; as by learned men it hath beene obſerued, and may be by many examples made good. But this mans owne words are ſufficient to confound him, and to conuince him alſo of manifeſt impietie.

As for the Gentiles, whether Chriſt had any reference

to their Ceremonies, or no, I will not raſhly ſay: but that hee did ſo accommodate himſelfe to the Iewes, as to inſtitute nothing in Rites and Ceremonies, which was not common and vſuall with them before, many learned men haue made it good by moſt certaine Teſtimonies of the Talmud, and other writings of the Iewes. They therefore that without breach of pietie haue followed Chriſts example in things indifferent, are they to bee eſteemed as impious and profane? or are not they much rather to be ſo accounted, who the more freely to deride their Aduerſaries, ſpare not Gods owne ſacred word, nor abſtaine from horrible blaſphemies? wherein how notorious this Hell-bound hath beene, it will be enough to declare by this one example.

                  •

                     •
                  th ſo confidently auerre them to haue euer beene all moſt deadly enemies unto Chriſtian Religion, and moſt ſtiffe perſiſters in the ſuperſtitions of their Anceſtors. For ſo in his tenth Chapter hee doeth expreſſely, and in ſo many words affirme, that for the ſpace of Pag. 43. 
               400. yeeres, the Romane Church of Emperours and Senators, were alwayes Oppoſites and Enemies unto the Law of Ieſus Christ. But in the next page, that, for the ſpace of 700. yeeres, or thereabouts, after the Incarnation of Chriſt, there was no Emperour, King nor Prince at Rome, that would embrac

                  ce, called the Empire of the Eaſt, and yet hee would neuer embrace the Character of Baptiſme, to be regenerated by the blood of Chriſt, till he was threeſcore and fiue yeeres olde, when hee was baptized by an Arrian Biſhop of Nicomedia, named Euſebius, when the ſame Conſtantine was at the point of death. Wherefore Sylueſter Biſhop of Rome need not vaunt of conuerting the Emperour to the Faith.
            Good God! what a prodigious libertie of lying is here? What fountaines of waters, what ſeas ſhall be able to waſh away the blacke poiſon of this moſt impure Calumniator? What, was not Conſtantine therefore, nor Iouinian, nor Valentinian, Gratian, not hee, whom ſo many

actions, ſo many glorious praiſes of the Chriſtians made famous, Theodoſius the Great, was not Hee a Chriſtian? But whereas hee denieth Conſtantine to haue beene a Chriſtian, becauſe hee deferred his baptiſme, it is well knowen that the moſt godly Emperour did that after the manner of his time then in vſe. For we finde that many in thoſe ages, who had ſincerely taken vpon them the name of Chriſt, deferred and put off their baptiſme a long while; who beleeuing all their former ſinnes to be waſhed away in this ſacred Lauer, did ſuppoſe that time to be the fitteſt for it, (as Euſebius writes in the life of Constantine lib. 4. c. 61.) when their life drew neereſt to an end; that by this meanes they might goe out of the world with a cleane and pure conſcience: againſt which cuſtome notwithſtanding, as being too full of danger and hazard, the F
                  •
               thers both Greeke and Latine that then flouriſhed, did mainely oppoſe themſelues. But there was a peculiar reaſon for Constantine beſides;

               becauſe (as he profeſſeth himſelfe in Euſeb.) if God had giuen him a longer life, his deſire and purpoſe was to haue beene baptized in Iordan, which Christ himſelfe had ſanctified with his owne baptiſme.
            
            
               And if he muſt therefore be thought to be auerſe from Chriſtianitie, becauſe he was baptized ſo late, what ſhall wee ſay of Valentinian, who hauing deferd his baptiſme farre longer, was ouertaken by ſuddaine death? whom neuertheleſſe S. Ambroſe vndoubtedly beleeued to haue beene receiued into heauen when he was dead, much leſſe made any queſtion of his liuing or dying a Chriſtian. Let vs heare S. Ambroſe himſelfe, 
               S. Ambroſ. de obitu Valent. 
               how he comforts the Siſters of this deceaſed Emperour. Sed audio vos dolere, quod non acceperit Sacramentum Baptiſmatis.

Hath he not therefore that grace which hee deſired? not that which he

            Now that Conſtantine was baptized by an Arrian Biſhop, howſoeuer this opinion be fauoured by S. Ierome, yet the contrary is maintained by others. The Emperours that ſucceeded next after Theodoſius the Great, whether they were Romane, or Barbarous, though they were many of them infected with the Arrian hereſie, yet Chriſtians they were all, and, which is moſt to the purpoſe, they were euery one farre from any ſuſpicion of Paganiſme.

The caſe was this. Symmachus was ſent Ambaſſadour by the Heathens to Ualentinian, to get them their Altar of Uictory reſtored, &c. but could not obtaine it.

But foraſmuch as our anſwere both to that, and to the Third part about the Sacrifice of the Church, groweth to a far greater bigneſſe, then wee thought it would haue done at first

                   I thought good to let thoſe Tractats rather bee publiſhed by themſelues, then that they ſhould let, or ſtay the Edition of this worke. But what hee here promiſeth being preuented by an vntimely death, he neuer publiſhed. And whether he began them onely, or brought them to any perfection, and left them ready for the Preſſe, I cannot tell, hauing neuer had any thing of them come into my hands; but ſure I am, that in this Pamplet beſides the very name of Caſaubon, there is nothing of

them at all. None of that candor which he vſed, none of that ſimplicitie, none of that accurate diligence is here to bee ſeene; nor any ſigne of that Method which hee had propoſed. Beſides that which my Father promiſed, he had gathered it all out of the Fathers, and other old Writers; here is no mention of Fathers, no teſtimonies produced from them, except three or foure at the moſt, which are brought in by the By at the latterend of the booke. That which we cited euen now from his exercitations, he wrote in the yeere of our Lord 1614. The French Edition of this Booke, out of which this Engliſh Copie was tranſlated an

And at that time, that is to ſay, in the yeere 1607. was his Booke De Eccleſiaſticâ Libertate vpon publiſhing; howſoeuer his name was ſuppreſſed; and yet that would doe no good, for when there was but a very little part of it printed, the Booke was called in by the Kings authority, and ſo Caſaubon forced to breake off that which he had vndertaken to write. Was it likely therefore that hee durſt venture to ſet foorth ſuch a virulent Booke as this, and one that was ſo vniuſtly written againſt the Papiſts? Or if he had ventured it, could hee haue eſcaped vnpuniſhed? Where were his Aduerſaries at that time, who, after his comming into England, and his firſt beginning to write about matters of Religion, oppoſed themſelues againſt him, in ſuch number, and ſuch bitterneſſe as they did? I haue a Catalogue by me of all the Books which my Father euer publiſhed, written with his owne hand, which elſewhere I haue ſet foorth to the world.

How came it to paſſe, that hee ſhould leaue out this? But what need wee any more, ſeeing the Impoſture of theſe deceitfull men is already detected? who had cunningly printed, and prefixed the name of Iſaac Caſaubon before a French Booke, which was put forth without any name at all, (as in France many are, ſpecially if they be Diuinitie Books;) and ſo by an artificiall immutation of the Arithmeticall figures for the yeere, put a new face vpon an old moth-eaten Pamphlet; ſuppoſing themſelues to be ſafe enough, if they could but any way tranſferre their impoſture vpon others. It concerned after ages, that at no time there ſhould be want of ſuch, as might both deprehend, and reuenge the fraudulent dealings of theſe wretchleſſe and wicked men.
