ſuch ſearch, ſhall not be fully finiſhed, and which, at the
time of ſuch ſearch, view, or ſuruey, ſo to be made as aforeſaid,
ſhall be found to be inſufficiently, falſely, and
deceitfully, made, wrought or repaired, as they muſt needes
be by that meanes dangerous to ſuch as ſhall vſe or imploy
them, to arreſt and ſtay vntill the ſame ſhall be reformed,
amended, repaired, & made fit for Nauigation. And
our further will and pleaſure is, that if the ſaid perſons

perſons or any of them ſhall forth-with charge and warne
the makers or owners of ſuch Shippes, Pinnaces or other
veſſells forthwith to take away the ſaid ſappy wood, redwood,
and other inſufficient wood and timber, and to ſupply
the ſame with other ſufficient timber and wood. And
if within conuenient time after ſuch charge and warning
giuen as is aforeſaid, the ſaid ſappy wood, red-wood, and
other inſufficient wood and timber be not taken away, and
the ſame ſupplied with other good and ſufficient timber
and wood as is aforeſaid. That then, it ſhall and may bee
lawfull to and for the ſaid Maſter and Wardens, or any
two of them, or any two of the ſaid Aſſiſtants, or any ſuch
deputie or deputies as aforeſaid to take and deface all ſuch
ſappy wood, and red-wood, and all and ſinguler ſuch other

timber and wood, which vpon any ſuch ſearch, and view,
and after conuenient admonition and warning giuen. to
take the ſame away and to ſupply it with better and more
ſufficient wood and timber, they ſhall finde to bee put in
or apparantly intended to be put into any Ship, Pinnace,
or other veſſell, or hewen, cut out, or wrought for that
purpoſe, manifeſtly tending to the preiudice and damage
of vs, our heires and ſucceſſors, or of any other our louing
ſubiects, Marchants and Marriners, whoſe goods and
liues are hazarded, & often loſt by reaſon of ſuch ill ſtuffe (the
vſe of all which ſappy and red-wood & other inſufficient
ſtuffe) we do hereby for vs, our heires and ſucceſſors, ſtraightly
prohibit and reſtraine to be vſed or imployed in any ſort
in or vpon any ſhippe or other veſſell. And our will and pleaſure
is, and wee doe by theſe preſents, for vs our heires and
ſucceſſors, grant vnto the ſaid Maiſter, Wardens, and Comminalty
and to their ſucceſſors for the time being, That it
ſhall and may bee lawfull to, and for, the ſaid Maſter, Wardens,
and Aſſiſtants for the time beeing, or the greater part

or both of them, as by the lawes and ſtatutes of this Realme
or by any lawes or ordinances, to bee made by the ſaid Corporation,
as is aforeſaid, ſhall, or may bee impoſed or inflicted
vppon them for their offence in that behalfe: Or otherwiſe,
that the ſaid Maſter and Wardens or any two of
them or ſuch other perſon or perſons, ſo authorized, as aforeſaid,
and which vpon the ſearch ſhall find any of the deceipts
and abuſes aforeſaid, ſhall complaine thereof to ſome Iuſtice
or Iuſtices of the Peace, within the place or county where
ſuch deceipts and abuſes ſhall bee found. And wee doe by
theſe preſents, for vs, our heires, and ſucceſſors, ſtraightly
charge and command, all, and euery our Iuſtice and Iuſtices,
of the Peace whatſoeuer, to whom any ſuch complaint or
complaints ſhall ſo bee made as is aforeſaid, that they and

euery of them, ſhall by all good and lawfull waies and meanes
examine and find out the truth of the ſaid complaints, abuſes
and deceipts. And if vpon due examination thereof, they
ſhall find that any ſuch abuſes and deceipts, haue beene commited
as aforeſaid: That then they cauſe the party or parties,
ſo offending, to be indited or otherwiſe puniſhed, for ſuch his,
and their abuſes and deceipts, either before our Iuſtices of
Peace, in the county where the ſame abuſes and deceipts ſhall
be committed and found at their Seſſions of the Peace, or before
the Iuſtices of Aſſize of the ſame county, or before any
other lawfull Iudge or Iudges, to the end that the ſaid perſon,
or perſons ſo offending, may receiue ſuch condigne puniſhment,
as by the lawes and ſtatutes of this Realme can or may
bee inflicted vpon him, or them, for his or their offence or
offences, in that behalfe. And our will and pleaſure is, And
wee doe by theſe preſents, for vs, our heyres and ſucceſſors,
ſtraightly charge and command the ſaid Maſter, Wardens,

without any reſpect of perſons, or partiality whatſoeuer.
Prouided alwaies neuertheles, and our will & pleaſure is, that
neither the Maſter, nor Wardens, of the ſaid Art or Miſtery,
for the time beeing, or any their Deputy or Deputies, ſo authorized
to ſearch as is aforeſaid, ſhall not by coullor of theſe
Letters Pattents, meddle with, or doe any thing to the hinderance,

Veſſell that is or ſhall bee at the time of ſuch their ſearch as

of the ſame. Any thing in theſe preſents to the contrary
thereof in any wiſe notwithſtanding.Power to trade beyond the ſeas. 
               And further of our
meere eſpeciall grace, certaine knowledge, and meere motion,
wee doe by theſe preſents, for vs, our heires, and ſucceſſors,
graunt vnto the ſaid Maſter, Wardens and Comminalty,

of the ſaid Art, or Miſtery of Ship-wrights of Redreth
aforeſaid and their Succeſſors for the time beeing: That it
ſhall and may bee lawfull to, and for all and euery perſon and
perſons, lawfully vſing or exercizing, or which heereafter

they ſhall thinke neceſſary or conuenient, for the building,
reparing, grauing, or fitting of Shippes, Pinaces, or other
Veſſels, and the ſame ſo bought, and prouided, ſhall and may

Wales or any part or place thereof, and the ſame diſcharge,

the full cuſtome, poundage, and other dueties due, or which
heereafter ſhall bee due to vs, our heires or ſucceſſors;

And whereas for the better mainteinance of Nauigation,
and incouragement of our louing ſubiects, to increaſe ſhipping
within this our Realme,Surueying of Tounage there is and hath bin of ancient
time an allowance giuen by vs, and our predeceſſors of
fiue ſhillings ſterling, for euery Tunne of any new builded
Ship to be rated according to the burden of the ſaid
ſhip, ſo as the ſaid ſhip did containe in burden one hundred
Tonnes or vpwards in Tonnes and tonnage, which laudable
cuſtome wee being pleaſed to continue, and finding
it alſo conuenient aſwell for the auoiding of abuſes that
might be offered in rating and ſetting downe the tonnage
of the ſaid ſhips and otherwiſe, as alſo that the builder might
haue his right and due allowance of tonnage, to appoint
ſome perſon or perſons of knowledge and experience, for
the ſurueying and ouerſeeing of the true rates and tonnage
in that behalfe, Wee did by our Letters Patents vnder

the great Seale of England, bearing date the 24. day of
Aprill, in the third yeare of our raigne, giue and graunt to
Iohn Grent gentleman, for and during his naturall life the
Office and place of Surueyour of the tonnage and burden
of all new builded Shippes of the burden aboue mentioned
or vpwards, from time to time within this our Realme
of England, together with the wages and fee of twelue
pence by the day of lawfull money of England, for the
exerciſing of the ſaid Office or place, together with all and
ſinguler other Fees, profits, commodities and allowances
whatſoeuer to the ſame place or Office in any wiſe due, incident
or appertaining, with a Prouiſo or clauſe therein mentioned,
that the ſaid Iohn Grent in the rating and ſetting down
of the tonnage & burden of the ſaidnew builded ſhips from
time to time ſhould vſe the aduice and aſſiſtance of one of
our ſhip-wrights to be nominated and appointed by our
High Admirall of England for the time being, And that all

ſhillings vpon euery Tonne of the burden of the ſaid Ships
ſhould be firſt allowed vnder the hand of the ſaid Surueyour,
and ſigned by the ſaid Admirall or his deputie for the
time being as hath beene accuſtomed. And whereas by our
Letters Patents, bearing date the 28. daie of Ianuary, in the
fourth yeare of our Raigne wee did graunt, or mention to
graunt vnto Humfrey Iobſon gent. for and during his naturall
life the Reuerſion of the ſaid Office or place of Surueyor of

for the exerciſing of the ſaid office, place, and all, and ſinguler
other Fees, profits, commodities and allowances
whatſoeuer to the ſame place or office in any wiſe due, incident
or appertaining As in, and by the ſaid two ſeuerall

Letters Pattens more at large appeareth. And whereas
of late we haue bin much wronged, defrauded, and abuſed, in
that ſundry of the ſaid ſhippes for want of exact viewing, ſurueying,
and meaſuring, haue beene ouer-rated in their burthen
and tonnage, wherby wee haue beene charged with the
payment of a greater allowance, then in truth wee ought to

And to the end, that we, our heires, and ſucceſſors, may not
at any time from henceforth, in like ſort be defrauded, wronged,
or abuſed, do of our ſpeciall grace, certaine knowledge,
and meere motion, giue and graunt to the ſaid Maſter, Wardens,
and Comminalty, and to their ſucceſſors for euer, the
office, function, and place of Surueyour of the tonnage and
burthen, of all new builded Ships of the burthen of an hundred

wages and fee of twelue pence by the day, and all other fees,
proffits, commodities, and allowances whatſoeuer, to the
ſaid office, or place in any wiſe due, belonging, incident or appertaining,
And them the ſaid Maſter, Wardens, and comminalty
and their ſucceſſors wee doe by theſe preſents, for
vs, our heires, and ſucceſſors, nominate, ordaine, make and
appoynt Surueyours of the tonnage and burthen of all new
builded Shippes from time to time, within this our Realme
of England, and Dominion of Wales. To haue, hold, exerciſe,

examination, iudging and finding out from hence forth
of the true burden and tonnage of euery Ship, and veſſell,
that is or ſhallbe capable of, or intended to haue or require
the ſaid alowance. Wee doe hereby for vs our heires and ſucceſſors

               And
whereas the greateſt number of the workmen and other perſons
imployed in the trades aforeſaid are ſoe very pore and
nedy, and of meane condition as no pecuniary mulct can take
hold of them, and likewiſe ſo rude and diſordered as noe ordinary
or ciuill cenſure can moue them to yeelde obedience
to rule or gouernment. And therefore ſome ſharpe and ſeuere
coertion and conſtraint muſt neceſſarily be vſed towards
them in many caſes. Therefore our will and pleaſure is, and
wee doe by theſe preſentes will and ordaine: That if any perſon

or perſons now vſing, or which ſhall hereafter vſe or exerciſe,
within the ſaid realme of England, or dominion of
Wales, the ſaid Art, Trade, or Miſtery of Ship-wrights, or
other the workes or trades aforeſaid ſhall obſtinately reſiſt

by theſe preſents giuen and granted to the ſaid Maiſter,
Wardens, and Cominalty, and their ſucceſſors for the vniuerſall
benifit and good of our ſaid Realme, dominion and
ſubiects. That the
                  •…
               , or in ſuch caſes, the Lord Admirall of
England for the time being, vpon complaint and profe therof
made to him, ſhall take the body or bodies of all and euery
ſuch notorious offendors and keepe them vnder arreſt, vntill
they ſhall conforme themſelues, and reforme what they
haue done amiſſe as aforeſaide. And for ſo much, as a great
part of the ſaid Art or Myſtery are continually for the moſt
part imploied, and attendant vpon the ſeruice and nauigation
of vs our heires and ſucceſſors. We therefore of our eſpeciall
grace, doe will and grant for vs our heires and ſucceſſors.
That the ſaide Maiſter, Wardens and Cominalty, or
any of them, or their, or any of their ſucceſſors ſhall not at
any time or times hereafter be informed, put, placed, or impannelled
in or vpon any Aſſizes, Iuries, Inqueſts, or attaintes

Pariſhes or places, by reaſon whereof they or any of

them ought to be charged, nor ſhall at any time be preſſed
or inforced to ſerue vs our heires or ſucceſſors as Land-ſoldiers,
but doe abſolutely and freely diſcharge them and euery
of them from any ſuch ſeruice and attendance. And wee doe
further by theſe preſents, for vs our heires and ſucceſſors
ſtraightly charge and commaund all and euery Sheriffes, Bailiffes,
and other officers of vs our heires and ſucceſſors that
they & every of them doe from time to time forbeare to put
or impanel any of the ſaid Maiſter, Wardens, and Cominalty,
or any their deputies or apprentiſes, in or vpon any ſuch
Iuries, or inqueſts as is aforeſaid, contrary to our ſaid meaning
& intent, vpon paine of our diſpleaſure, & of ſuch paines,
penalties, and impriſonments as by the lawes of this our
Realme can or may be inflicted or impoſed vpon them or any
of them for their contempt, in doing contrary to our royall
pleaſure and commandment in that behalfe. And whereas
the Maſter, Wardens, and Cominalty of the ſaid Art or Miſtery
of Ship-wrights of Redrith aforeſaid, and their and euery
of their deputies and apprentiſes being continually for the
moſt part charged and chargeable to be ready and prouided
at an howers warning vpon diuers ſeruices and imployments
as well at the Sea, for the neceſſity, defence, and ſafety of
our realmes and kingdomes, and for the uſe and imployment
of our Marchants for continuance and increaſe of trade and
commerce with forraine Nations, for the benefit and profit
of vs and our ſubiects, as alſo to giue attendance within
our Kingdomes for the new building, repairing, and triming
as well of the Shippes, Pinnaces, and veſſels of vs, our
heires & ſucceſſors, as alſo of the Ships Pinnaces, and veſſels
of our Marchants and ſubiects. Therefore our will and pleaſure
is. That if it ſhall hapen the ſaid Maiſter, Wardens, and
Comminalty, or other perſons, which by the true intent and
meaning hereof are and ought to be diſcharged from ſuch
ſeruice vpon Iuries or Inq
                  •
               eſts, ſhall by Sheriffes, Bailiffes
or other officers, ignorantly or wilfully be put and impannelled
to ſerue vpon Iuries, and Enqueſts, contrary to our

true intent and meaning, in that behalfe, in certaine our former
Letters Pattents graunted, and alſo in theſe preſents renued.
And that any of the ſaid perſons beeing abſent from
their houſes, and places of habitation, at ſuch times as they
were, or ſhall bee ſommoned or warned to appeare vpon any
ſuch Iuries or enqueſts, could not, nor cannot plead or
alleadge the ſaid former Letters Pattents nor theſe preſents,
or the priueledges and authorities hereby giuen and granted
vnto them, for their diſcharge in that behalfe, whereby diuers
iſſues, fines, and amercements are many times returned
againſt them, contrary to our true intent and meaning:
Wee doe therefore graunt for vs, our heires and ſucceſſors, vnto
the ſaid Maſter, Wardens, and Comminalty, and their ſucceſſors
for euer: That if any iſſues, fines, and amercements
ſhall be returned, forfeited or impoſed by, or vppon any of the
ſaid perſon or perſons of the ſaid Corporation, Trade, Art,
or Miſtery, for or in reſpect of not doing, or not performing
of any of the ſaid ſeruices or other things whereof they are
hereby exempted or freed, or mentioned to be exempted or
freed: That then the ſame perſon or perſons, his, or their
heires, executors, adminiſtrators and aſſignes and euery of
them, and all his and their landes, tenements, goods, and
chattels ſhall be for euer freed and diſcharged of and from
the ſame iſſues, fines, and amerciaments, and euery of them.
And wee doe require and commaund the Barons of our Eſchequer
that in reſpect of the pouerty of many that are to
be releeued in this caſe, they giue them all expedition and
eaſe in the proceedings and pleading for their diſcharge in
that behalfe.Submiſsion to the Charter. 
               And becauſe this Corporation of Ship-wrights
hath bin principally inſtituted & made for the mainteinance
and encreaſe of Nauigation and for the better and more ſubſtantiall
making, building and repairing of ſhips, and alſo for
the trayning vp & inſtructing of Ship-wrights, Ship-carpenters,
labourers, and workemen to make them more ready, able
and skilfull for ſeruice, All which things do very greatly concerne
the defence, ſafety, wealth and profit of our ſelfe, our

Kingdomes and ſubiects. Therefore wee doe not onely
ſtraightly charge and command all and euery perſon and perſons
which are or ſhall be of the Cominaltie of this Corporation.
That they doe dutifully ſubmit themſelues to ſuch
good and wholeſome lawes, ſtatutes and ordinances as
ſhall be heereafter ordained and made by vertue of theſe
Letters Patents for the gouernment, rule, order and direction
of this Corporation, and of all the members thereof,
But wee doe alſo ſtraightly require, charge and command
all Maſters, Wardens, and Aſſiſtants, deputies and other the
principall Officers of this incorporation now being, and that
heereafter ſhall bee. That they and euery of them in their
ſeuerall Offices and places, doe carefully, diligently and circumſpectly
looke to the due and ſeuere execution of all ſuch
lawes, ſtatutes, and ordinances ſo to be made as aforeſaid,
that the ſame may be truely performed and accompliſhed
according to the tenor and true meaning of the ſame, vpon
paine of our heauy diſpleaſure and indignation and of
ſuch puniſhment and impriſonment as by our lawes may be
inflicted on them and euery or any of them, wherein our
meaning is to extend the greater puniſhment vpon ſuch
as hauing offices and places of truſt and charge committed
vnto them, ſhall by wilfulneſſe, negligence, remiſneſſe,
partialitie, or otherwiſe offend themſelues, or ſuffer others
to offend in thoſe things, whereof they ought to
bee the reformers and redreſſers, and at whoſe hands wee
expect to receiue and haue amendement and reformation
of all offences that ſhall bee committed by any others
in that behalfe. And foraſmuch as the pouertie
of Ship-wrights and perſons belonging to the ſaid Corporation
is now much more increaſed then in former
times, and not able to be releeued, ſupported and maintained,
by the duties and reuenues of the ſaid Corporation which
heertofore they haue had, or were enabled to haue, being ſo
ſmall in yeerely value.Power to purchaſe. Therefore, and to the end, the ſaid Maſter,
