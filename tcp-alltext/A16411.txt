                  MY Lords, for that
we haue cauſed a treatie
to be made with diuerſe
of the particular
Prouinces concerning the matter of
reconciliation with his Maieſtye,
and fynding, the ſame well inclined
thereto, albeit their deſyre is, that it
ſhould rather proceed from you that
are aſſembled at Antwerpe (his Maieſties
intention and ours concurring
therewith.) We haue thought
good to aduertiſe you of the ſame his
good meaning, that in caſe you haue
any deſire to do the like with conuenient
expedition: (yet lying in you either
to hynder or further all thoſe
harmes, wronges and oppreſſions,
which theſe preſent wars do bring)
you would ſignify your meaning vnto

                  MY Lord we
haue receiued
your Letter,
dated the xii.
of this inſtant
March, touching
the agreements
of the
Prouinces, with our ſouereigne
Lorde the King of Spaine: For aunſwere
wherunto, we aduertiſe your
excellency, that in regard of vs there
hath not bin any duty or good occaſion
omitted that might tend to the
concluding of a good & aſſured peace,
as by our actions may plainely appeare
to the whole world. For in the
moneth of Auguſt laſt, the Ambaſſadours
of the imperial Maieſty, of the
King of Fraunce and the Queene of
England being aſſembled with our

Deputies at Louan a place of th
                  •
               
appointment of the late Lorde Do
                     •
                  
Ihon of Auſtriche, with good hope t
                  •
               
conclude a peace. The cauſe was i
                  •
               
good forwardneſſe, and like to ſucceede
to a good effect. How be it th
                  •
               
King of Spaine, tooke the matter ou
                  •
               
of the hands of the ſaide Don Ihon o
                  •
               
               Auſtriche, and referred the treatie
and negoſiation therof to the Imperiall
Maieſty. Whereuppon for that
no endeuour on our be half ſhould be
ſlacked, which might aduaunce the
foreſaid treaty of peace: the Earle of
Swartzenbergh Ambaſſadour to the
Emprours Maieſty, by our conſent
and requeſt, iorneyed twice to your
excellency to treate and pac
                  •
               fy the viſſagrement
betwixt the Kinges Maieſty
and thoſe Countries according
to the meaning & aſſent of the King
of Spaine, and our-ſubmiſſion. But
notwithſtanding all his endeuour
employed therin, we finde that your

excellency, was not onely farre from
ionyng: but alſo the better to oppoſe
your ſelues to the ſame, entertained
the ſaide Ambaſſadour with
many delayes, and in ſteede of vpright
dealing with ye generalty touching
the ſaide treaty of peace, practiſed
by meanes therof and by indirect
and perticuler treatings, to procure
a ſeperation and diſſention of the
Prouinces: So that we cannot perceiue
any reaſon that your excellency
hath to ſaye, that the ſame hath not
bin in any faulte to agree to a good
peace with all vprightneſſe and ſyncerity.
Neither can we ſee by what
meanes your excellency  can diſcharg
your ſelfe either before the Imperial
Maieſty for the delaies and 
                  〈◊〉
               
vſed toward his Ambaſſadour▪
or before God and the whole world,
for the ſhamefull ſuſpitions and miſſtruſtinges
vſed in y• matter. Which
are encreaſed in all truſty and diſcret

hartes: by reaſon that (the King of
Spaine hauing openly reuoked, diſallowed,
and diſanulled the pacification
of Gaunte, when the Countries
might and greatly deſired to obſerue
and keepe the ſame.) Your excellency
now in this time after ſo many alterations
and troubles preſenteth againe
by the aforeſaid Letter, the ratification
of the ſame peace with this
condition, that the onely exerciſe of
the Catholike Romiſh Religion and
the dutiful obedience to his Maieſty
ſhould be maintained and obſerued,
as it was in the time of the late Emperour
Charles: the which is altogether
contrary vnto the foreſaide pacification
and a manifeſt breach therof,
and ſuch as al the States in generall
haue found to be directly againſt
the common welth and other Countries.
For that in the time of the late
ſaide Emperour Charles, the cruell
burninges, Statutes and other

Rigors were in ſuche force and ſo
ſharplye executed for the preſeruation
and defending of the foreſaid exerciſe
of the Ronuſh Religion, that
the fore ſaide States generally and
with one common accorde, for the
maintenance of the profitable trade
and traficke of merchandize with other
Countries that were for theyr
benefit, were conſtrained to procure
ye ſame to be mitigated & reſtrained.
            Whereby your excellencie may wel
perceyue, what proceedings and effects
we may hope for, by meanes of
ſuch preſentations which are vnpoſſible
to be practiſed or put in effect.
Being moſte ſorye that a caſe of ſo
great waighte and importance, proceedeth
not with more ſpeede and
diſcretion. Not withſtanding to expreſſe
our good willes and ready affections
to the peace, we are ſtill conteut
according to the offer of the imperiall
Maieſtye and conſent of the

King of Spaine that the ſame ſhalbe
negotiated and treated by the ſayde
Ambaſſador wh
                  ••
               e the oportunieye
of the affaires of theſe parties, and
the treaties whereinto we are entred
with others ſhall permitte the
ſame: yet if your excellencie hath an
earneſt & zealous meaning to make
a ſhort treatie and concluſion, and to
reduce the matter to a good end and
aſſured reſt, it may pleaſe the ſame
by vertue of his aucthority without
ſo many delayes and retreaties to
take a ſhorter way to make prouiſion
againſt the deſtruction & oppreſſion
of the cuntreyes ſo greatly and
ſo long time afflicted, agreeing with
ſinceritye and vprightnes to that
which wilbe the proſperity and reſt
of the ſubiects and inhabitants of
the ſame, by the general States and
conſultations which are to be holden
and vſed in that behalfe according
to equitie and reaſon. And we

for our parte (if your excellencye
through longe delaye henceſorth doo
not hinder all occaſions and commodities
to doo the ſame) will not faile
to harken to all reaſonable condicions,
for the performance whereof
we may haue good aſſuraunce and
warrant. Proteſting as we haue
already proteſted to the Barron of
Selles and others, that all inconueniencies
& alterations which hereafter
may happen, ſhalbe knowen,
which with purſuing of warres againſt
theſe Cuntryes, doo giue occaſion
of greater miſtruſting miſliking
and alterations of the ſubiects.
With this we praye the almightye
God (my Lord) to haue your excellencie
in his keeping.
