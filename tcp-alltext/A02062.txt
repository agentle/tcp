            ¶ Whether ye trolle in or els trolle out
            ye trolle vntruly / loke better about.
            
               
                  WHere as of late two thinges ye parused
               Concerning the treason of Thomas Crumwell
               Vndoutedly both your wyt and your syght were confused
               Lackyng a medecyne / blyndnesse to expell
               Put on your spectacles and marke it well
               Than shall you se / and say / maugre your hart
               That trolle in / hath played a true subiectes part
            
            
               
                  ❧ For where as trolle a way (as ye say) tolde trouth
               Declaring the offences / wherin Crumwell offended
               It was not the thyng / wherwith troll in was wroth
               For in that poynt / Troll in / Troll away commended
               But this was the mater / wherfore they contended
               Trolle away / vnder pretence of trollyng against treason
               Practised proude popery / as appereth by reason.
            
            
               ☞ And ye supporting the same / your pen runneth at large
               Boldly as blynde bayerd / ye write in his defence
               And in your myscheuous maner / ye lay falsly to my charge
               Sayeng / who that craftely coloureth any others offence
               Of lykelyhode in his owne hert / hath the same pretence
               But here ye speke of lykelyhode / and so blyndly go by gesse
               your fondnesse is the folyssher / and my faute is the lesse.
            
            
               ¶ An horse beyng nothing galled / of force ye may make to kycke
               With spurryng and with prickinge / more than reason wolde requyre
               But if the horse were lustye / coragious and also quycke
               ye might be the fyrst perchaunce / that might lye in the myre
               As wyse as ye / haue ben drowned in their owne desyre
               Many a man / anothers mischefe / of malyce wyll prepare
               And yet him selfe the fyrst / that is caught in the snare.
            
            
               ¶ Bycause of making stryfe (ye say) ye wyll take neither parte
               But here ye breke promyse / for agaynst all reason and right
                     Ve illi per qem scandalū uenit, Luce, xvij.
                  
               
               Speking with your mouth / that you thinke not with your harte
               Agaynst trolle in / ye take trolle awayes parte / with all your myght
               Thus all thinges lyghtly that ye make / amonge them selues do fyght
               Wherfore whatsoeuer ye write or saye / gretly it shall not skyll
               For if ye speke any thing wysely / I thinke it be agaynst your wyll.
            
            
               ¶ But blyndly haue ye sclaundred me / good maister Thomas Smyth
               Scraping togither scriptures / your madnesse to mayntayne
               Truly your rude rowsty reason / being so farre from the pyth
               Had nede of suche a cloke / to kepe it from the rayne
               For all the worlde may perceyue / how falsly ye forge and fayne
               Yet styll you affyrme your falshed / as though ye knew thinges presysely
               Christes blessyng on your hert / forsoth ye haue done full wysely.
            
            
               ¶ Ye rumble amonge the scryptures / as one that were halfe mad
               Wrestyng and writhyng them / accordyng to your owne purpose
               Facyonyng and framyng them / to your sayenges good and bad
               Lyke as the holy Papystes / were wont to paynt their popysshe glose
               Do ye take the holy scripture to be lyke a shypmans hose?
               Nay nay / although a shypmans hose / wyll serue all sortes of legges
               yet Christes holy scrypture / wyll serue no rotten dregges.
            
            
               
               ☞ Counsell with some tayler / whan that ye wryte nexte
               Take measure of diuinyte / before ye cut the facyon
               So shall ye square your scryptures / and the better trym your texte
               And than shall men of lernyng / commende your operacyon
               But howe shulde he be connyng / that knoweth not his occupacyon
               Howe shuld a cobler cut a core / or a smyth tast good wyne
               Or how shulde you scarsely a clerke / be nowe a good deuyne?
            
            
               
                  ❧ What lyuyng man (excepte it were you) beynge in his right wyttes
               Wolde write as ye haue written / and all not worth a myte
               I thinke it be some peuysshe pange / that cometh ouer your hert by fyttes
               Vnder the coloure of charyte / to worke your cruell spyte
               If men wolde marke your madnesse / and beholde your deuelyssh delyte
               Shuld se how ye wrest ye scriptures to your sayēg / not worth .ii. chippes
               And ioyne them all togither / as iust as Germans lyppes.
            
            
               ¶ Whan ye haue spytte your poyson / and sayde euen the worst ye can
               Than come ye in with charite / wyllyng all stryfe to cease
               But surely good maister Smyth / ye speke lyke a mery man
               Moche lyke a comen pyke quarell / that stryfe wolde encrease
               Continually cryeng in frayes / holde / kepe the kynges pease
               But those be prety peace makers / in dede for euery daye
               That styll bestowe mo strokes / than they that began the fraye.
            
            
               ☞ What wyse man wolde not laugh / for to here you bragge and boste
               Of your name / your seruyce / of your offyce and all this gere
               
                  
                     Qui se laudat stercore coronabit,
                  As though ye were prymrose perelesse / and a ruler of the roste
               By the declaryng wherof / ye thinke to put pore men in fere
               But your braggyng and your bostyng / shall neyther be here nor there
               As longe as I may indifferently / be suffred to vse my pen
               ye shall neuer be able to face me out / with a carde of ten.
            
            
               
                  ❧ A wyse man wolde haue praysed god / and than prayed for the kyng
               The which of their gret goodnesse / to your offyce dyd you call
               And not to haue bragged therof / and than put it out in printyng
               For ye stande not yet so sure / but it is possyble ye may fall
               And though your offyce be great / I trust your power be but small
               Or els parchaūce ye wold quickly thurst a poore man amōg the thornes
               But god almyghty prouydeth well to sende a shrewde cow short hornes.
            
            
               ¶ Christ preserue the kynges most noble grace / & sende him longe lyfe
               Euen Henry the eight (next vnder god) of this church / the hed supreme
               Christ preserue & kepe quene Katheryn / his most lawfull wyfe
               Christ preserue Prince Edwarde / the very right heyre of this realme
