wyll / as if a waspe be put in to the cuppe and geuen a blyndeman to drynke that thirsteth. For nonotherwyse haue they wrapped in the doctryne of the deuyll and cowpled it with their prophane orders / so that if yu wylt be admitted to be preiste to preche the gospel (for Criste knew nonother cheif office of preisthod) whiche thou art bownde in conscience to do if thou beist called therto of God / yet wil they bynde the to lyue sole agēst thy will / & bere y• in hāde that yu vowest their chastite whē yu nether sayist it nor thinkest it / & so clogge the with that tother thinge so couertly inwrapped that it is not in thy lyberte to performe it.

God / which is not geuen to euery man that wolde haue it / wherefore he were but a fole yt wolde make a vowe to expowne scriptures ere God had geuen hym the gifte and so sent him to preche. Nether ar ye giftis of God as faith / hope / loue / to heale the syke or to do miracles comē for euery mā no more then is wyuelesse chastite comō for euery preist / as experiēce techeth vs. yisse (saye thei)The obiecciō of the papistis is soluted. if ye wolde aske it of God as we do / ye shuld haue it as we it haue / for do not Criste promyse (say thei) yt whatsoeuer ye aske the father in his name / he wil ge ue it you? I answere this aduouterouse generacion / yt themselues / as thei neuer beleued this saying of Criste / so did thei neuer aske it in his name / For well I wote / & so do their owne cōsciences & deades tel thē / yt skant one emōge an. c. hath his gift of chastite for al their pray ing / I wold thei which yet kepe whores themselues / & bid vs praye yt wolde or haue wyues / wolde once singe this karoll to themselues / Aske & ye shall haue it / and so put awaye their whores.

But how can thei aske any thing in Cri stis name / when they blaspheme his holy name and dispise his holy ordinances and holesome remedies tempting God so wikedly as thei do? The peticion to lyue sole / as it may not be asked of euery man and woman / so is it not for the glorye of his name euery shauē that bur neth in luste to aske it / when god for his glorye created the remedy & helpe saying vpō siche that it is not good for man alone to lyue / let vs therfore make hym a felowe helper. He therfore tempteth God / which (y• remedye created of god despised) will praye to lyue alone / so farof is this mā to glorifye him. Also if euery man and woman that asketh it shuld haue it / so were it no speciall gift but as comon as the prayer. But be it in case that euery preist asketh it / yet shall not euery preist haue it / for Crist hymself saithe / Euery of them is not apte nor ableMat. xix to receyue it / but thei vnto whom it is geuen.

                   obtayned by peticion is no vowe / but a gifte. by prayer / so were it no vowe no more then faithe or the gift to vnder

stande scriptures. For we praye for that thinge whiche is not in our liberty and power to haue or to do it. And here is it playne / by ye papistis owne reasening that thei destroye their owne vowe of chastite / making it no vowe at all but a gift of God / and not in our lybertye nether to vowe it nor to haue it as we wolde. Wherfore as Wynch. hathe vnaduysedly made vowes to let preistis mariage / so hathe he vnaduysedly diffyned them. Those thingis whiche we ar cōmanded of God to aske of him / ar playnly prescribed vnto vs in his scri ptures / which ar the declaracion of his wyl and of what thinge so euer maketh for his glorye / but it is nowhere redde of any precept or ensample for vs to lyue sole / but that euery man that cannot so liue is cōmanded to marye to auoyde fornicacion and not to praye so to lyue alone / wherfore the remedye so graciously prouyded of God / and set before our eyes / it is not els but a tempting of God and not a praying to hym for the gift. Nonotherwyse then when God

createth meat set before the to eate it & thou forsakest it being hungrye / & prayest God to lyue without meat. Wherefore when our shamelesse chamosts alledge vs theis scriptures to pray for their chastite / they alledge them nonotherwyse to vs then did the deuill vnto Criste brought vpō the pynnacle of the temple / sayinge / If thou be

It is writē that siche yong vowers i. tim. v. at yt age shuld be reiected / And in no place of scripture is there precept or ensample yt god accepted sich supersticiouse
