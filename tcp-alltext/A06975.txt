            To the vnderstanding Reader.
            
               RVMOR that Hydra headed Monster, with more tongues then eyes, by help of his intelligencer enuy hath made strange misconstructions on this dumbe Knight, which then could not answere for himselfe: but now this publication doth vnty his tongue, to answer the obiections of all sharp critticall censures which heretofore haue vndeseruedly past vpon him. And for my part (I protest) the wrongs I haue receiued by some (whose worths I will not traduce) with a milde neglect I haue laught at their follies; for I thinke my selfe happy, because I haue beene enuyde, since the best now in grace haue beene subiect to some slanderous tongues that want worth themselues, and thinke it great praise to them to detract praise from other that deserue it; yet hauing a partner in the wrong, whose worth hath beene often approued, I count the wrong but halfe a wrong, because hee knowes best how to answer for himselfe: But I now in his absence, make this Apologie, both for him and me. Thus leauing you and the booke together, I euer rest yours.

            Act. 1.
            
               Sce. 1. Musicke,
               Enter the King of Cypres, Phylocles, Florio, and attendants in armes.
               
                  Cypr.
                  
                     INnough, these loud sounds deafes my passions
                  How long shall loue make me a slaue to hope,
                  And mixe my calme desires with tyranny?
                  O Phylocles t'is heresie I hold,
                  Thought and affection cannot be controld.
               
               
                  Phy.
                  Yet mai't be bent and suppled with extreames,
                  Sith few dare see the end of violence
                  What makes the skilfull Leech to vse the fire,
                  Or warre her engines, or states policie,
                  But to recouer things most desperate?
                  Reuolt is recreant when pursuit is braue,
                  Neuer to faint doth purchase what we craue
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  True my Phylocles, yet my recreant soule,
                  Slaued to her beauty, would renounce all warre,
                  And yeeld her right to loue, did not thy spirit
                  Mixt with my longing, fortifie these armes.
                  But I am now resolud and this sad houre,
                  Shall giue an end to my disemprature.
                  Summon a parley.
               
               Enter a loft, the Queene of Sicille, the Duke of Epire, Alphouso and attendants.
               
                  Queene.
                  What saies our tyrant sutor, our disease in loue,
                  That makes our thoughts a slaue vnto his sword:
                  What saies my Lord?
               
               
                  
                  Cyp.
                  Madame attend me, this is my latest summons,
                  The many sunnes my sorrowes haue beheld,
                  And my sad nights of longings, all through hope,
                  T'enioy the ioy of earth, (your owne deare selfe)
                  Are growne so infinite in length and waight,
                  That like to wearied Atlas, I inforce
                  These warres as Hercules, to beare my loade:
                  Briefly I must enioy you, or else loose
                  The breath of life, which to preuent, behold,
                  My sword must be my Cupid, and with feathered steele,
                  Force pity from your breast, your Cities walles,
                  Chidden with my Canons, haue set ope a path
                  And boldly bids me enter, all your men of warre,
                  Feebled with famine, and a weary siege,
                  Take danger from mine actions, onely your selfe,
                  Strong in your will, oppose euen destiny:
                  And like the giants warre offend the heauens,
                  Which to preuent, do but discend and giue
                  Peace to my loue-suit, and as orecome thereby,
                  I'le yeeld my selfe your prisoner, and be drawne,
                  A thrall in your triumphant victory.
                  If otherwise, behold these fatall swords,
                  Shall neuer be sheath'd, till we be conquerours:
                  And not respecting innocence nor sexe,
                  The cries of infants, nor the prayers of age,
                  All things shall perish, till within my armes
                  I fould your selfe my thrall and conquerour.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  Thou maiest be maister of my bodies Tombe
                  But for my soule and minde, they are as free
                  As their creation: and with Angels wings
                  Can soare beyond thy reach; trust me king of Cypres
                  
                  Those coales the Roman Portia did deuour,
                  Are not burnt out, nor haue th'Egiptian wormes,
                  Yet lost their stings, steele holds his temper still,
                  And these are ransomes from captiuity.
                  But art thou noble, hast thou one royall thought?
               
               
                  
                  Cyp.
                  Approue me by your question.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  Then briefly thus:
                  To shun the great effusion of their bloods,
                  Who feele no touch in mine affections,
                  Dare you to single combate, two to two,
                  Referre your right in loue?
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  Who are your combatants? we loue equality.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  This is the first, the Epyre duke, a man,
                  Sprung from the line, of famous Scanderbag:
                  
                  The next Alphonso, sprung from noble bloud:
                  Who laden with rich lusitanian prize,
                  Hath rod through Syracusa twice in pompe.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  Their likings to the motion.
               
               
                  Ep.
                  They are like wrath,
                  Neuer vnarmd to beat weake iniury.
               
               
                  Alp.
                  Nay more, we are the sonnes of destiny:
                  Vertu's our guide, our ayme is dignity.
               
               
                  Phy.
                  S'foot king, shalt not forsake them: this I see,
                  Loue, fight, and death, are rul'd by destiny.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  My spirit speakes thy motion.
                  Madame, although aduantage might euade,
                  And giue my loue more hope, yet my bent will,
                  Bowd to your pleasure, doth imbrace your lawe,
                  We do accept the combate, and our selfe
                  Will with that Duke try fortunes, this my friend,
                  The more part of my selfe, me deerest Philocles,
                  
                  One of an Angels temper, shall with that that Lord
                  Trie best and worst the place, the time, the sword.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  They are your rights, we claime as challengers.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  And we would lose that vantage, but since fame
                  Makes vertue dulat, we embrace our rights:
                  The place before these walles, the houre next sunne,
                  The pollax and the hand axe for the fight.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  It is enough,
                  My hostage is my person and my loue:
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  And mine my hope, my faith and royalty.
               
               
                  
                  Epy.
                  They are of poysse sufficient, and one light
                  Shall at one instant, giue vs day and night.
               
               Exeunt. Queene, Mariano, Alphonso.
               
                  Cyp.
                  Shee's gone my Philocles: and as she goes euen so,
                  The sunne forsakes the heauens to kisse the sea,
                  Day in her beauty leaues vs, and methinkes,
                  Her absence doth exile all happines.
                  Tell me my Philocles, nay pray thee tell me true,
                  Euen from that loue
                  Which to vs both should bend one sympathy:
                  Discharge an open breast, dost thou not thinke,
                  She is the mirror of her beauteous sexe?
                  Vnparalleld, and vncompanioned.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  Enuy will say shee's rare, then truth must vow,
                  She is beyond compare, sith in her lookes,
                  Each motion hath a speaking maiesty,
                  She is herselfe, compared with her selfe:
                  For but her selfe, she hath no companion.
                  But when I thinke of beauty, wit and grace,
                  The elements of actiue delicacy,
                  Those all eie-pleasing harmonies of sight
                  Which do inchant mens fancies, and stir vp
                  The life bloud of dull earth, O then methinkes,
                  Faire Mariana hath an equall place
                  And if not outshine, it shewes more beautifull.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  More then my Queene?
               
               
                  Phi.
                  More in the glosse of beauty, lesse in worth,
                  Of wisedome and great thoughts, the one I finde
                  was made for wonder, th'other for admire.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  Thine equall praises makes my facnies rich:
                  And I am pleas'd with thy comparisons,
                  Things of like nature liue in best consent,
                  Beauty with subiects, maiesty with Kings,
                  Then let those two Ideaes liuely moue,
                  Spirit beyond all spirit, in our breasts,
                  
                  That in the end of our great victory,
                  we may attaine both loue and maiesty.
               
               
                  Phy.
                  Although my first creation and my birth,
                  My thoughts and other tempers of my soules,
                  Tooke all their noble beings from the sword,
                  And made me onely for the vse of warres:
                  Yet in this combate, something methinkes apeares,
                  Greater then greatest glory, and doth raise
                  My minde beyond her selfe,
                  S'foot methinkes Casars Pharsalia,
                  Nor Scipios Carthage, nor Emilias acts,
                  Were worthy chaires of triumph, they ore mens
                  Poore mangled bodies, and fire-wasted climes,
                  Made their triumphant passage, but we two
                  Must conquer thoughts and loue, more then the gods can doe.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  True, and therein
                  Consists the glorious garland of our praise,
                  But we neglect th'affaires of preparation. Florio be it your charge
                  To see th'erection of the squared lists,
                  Fit ground for either army, and what else,
                  Belongs vnto such royall eminence.
               
               
                  Flo.
                  How neere will your maiesties hand the lists extend
                  Vnto the Cities walles?
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  So as the dullest eie,
                  May see the heedfulst passage in the fight.
               
               
                  Flo.
                  What square or circuite?
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  Threescore pace each way.
               
               
                  Flo.
                  Your maiesty shal haue your will perform'd.
               
               
                  Phy.
                  Do, and you do vs grace; and now thou sunne,
                  That art the eye of heauen, whose pure sight,
                  Shall be our guide, and Ioues great Chronicler,
                  Looke from thy spheare,
                  No guilt of pride, of mallice or of blood,
                  Puts on our armour, onely pure naked loue
                  Tutors our hopes, and doth our actions moue.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  Enough my Philocles, thine orizons are heard.
                  
                  Come lets away.
               
               Exeunt.
               Enter Lollia, the wife of Prat the Orator.
               
                  Lol.
                  Now fy vpon't, who would be an Orators wife, and not a Gentlewoman if she could chuse? a Lady is the most sweet lasciuious life, conieyes and kisses, the tire, O the tire, made castell vpon castell, iewell vpon iewell, knot vpon knot, crownes, garlands, gardins, and what not? the hood, the rebato, the french fall, the loose bodyed gowne, the pinne in the haire, now clawing the pate, then picking the teeth, and euery day change, when we poore soules must come and goe for euery mans pleasure, and what's a Lady more then another body? we haue legges and hands, and rouling eies, hanging lips, sleeke browes, cherrie cheekes, and other things as Ladies haue, but the fashion carries it away.
               
               Enter Mistresse Collaquintida.
               
                  Col.
                  Why how now Mistresse Prat? i'the old disease still, will it neuer be better, cannot a woman finde one kind man amongst twentie? O the daies that I haue seene, when the lawe of a womans wit, could haue put her husbands purse to execution.

                  O Mistresse Collaquintida, mine is euen the vnnaturallest man to his wife.
               
               
                  Col.
                  Faith for the most part, all schollers are so: for they take so vpon thē to know al things, that indeed they know nothing: & besides, they are with study and ease, growne so vnweldy, that a woman shall neare want a sore stomacke that's troubled with them.
               
               
                  Lol.
                  And yet they must haue the gouernment of all.
               
               
                  Col.
                  True, and great reason they haue for it, but a wise man will put it in a womans hand, what? shee'le saue what he spends.
               
               
                  Lol.
                  You haue a pretty ruffe, how deep is it?
               
               
                  Col.
                  Nay this is but shallow, marry I haue a ruffe is a quarter deep, measured by the yeard.
               
               
                  Lol.
                  Indeed, by the yeard?
               
               
                  Col.
                  By the standard I assure you: you haue a pretty set too, how big is the steele you set with?
               
               
                  Lol.
                  As big as a reasonable sufficient; pitty of my life, I haue forgot my selfe, if my husband should rise from his study, and misse me, wee should haue such a coile.
               
               
                  
                  Co.
                  A coyle, why what coyle? if he were my husband and did but thwart mee, I would ring him so many alarums, sound him so many brasse trumpets, beate him so many drums to his confusion, and thunder him such a peale of great shot, that I would turne his brain in the panne, and make him madde with an eternall silence.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  O mistresse Coloquintida, but my husbands anger is the worst fauouredst without all conscience of any mans in all Sicilie, he is euen as peeuish as a sick munkie, and as waspish as an ill pleasd bride the second morning.
               
               
                  Co.
                  Let your wrath be reciprocall, and pay him at his owne weapon: but to the purpose for which I came, the party you wote of, commends him to you in this diamond, hee that met the party you know, and said the parties partie was a party of a partly pretty vnderstanding.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  O the Lord, Alphonso.
                  
               
               
                  Co.
                  The very same beleeue it, he loues you, and sweares he so loues you, that if you doe not credit him you are worse then an infidell.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Indeede mistresse Coloquintida, he hath the right garbe for apparell, the true touch with the tongue in the kisse, and he dances well but falles heauily: but my husband woman, my husband, if we could put out his cattes eies, there were something to be said but they are euer peeping & prying that they are able to pierce through a milstone: besides: I may say to you, he is a little iealous too, and see where hee comes, wee shall haue a coyle now.
               
               Enter Prate the Orator.
               
                  Co.
                  Begin you to pout first, for thats a womans preuention.
               
               
                  Pra.
                  What Lollia I say, where are you my house lookes you, my men lack you, I seeke you, and a whole quest of inquiry cannot finde you, fy, fy, fy, fy, Idlenes is the whip of thrift, a good huswife should euer be occupied?
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Indeede I haue much ioy to bee occupied in any bodies company.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  Why, whats the matter?
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Why Orators wiues shortly will bee knowne like images on water staires, euer in one wetherbeaten suite, as if none wore hoodes but Monkes and Ladies, nor feathers but fore-horses and waiting gentlewomen,

nor chaines but prisoners and Lords officers, nor perriwigs but players and hotte braines, but the weakest must to the walles still.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  Go to, you shall haue what you will.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Nay nay, 'twas my hard fortune to be your wife, time was I might haue done otherwise, but it matters not, you esteeme me as you doe your selfe, and thinke all things costly enough that couers shame, and that a paire of silken foresleeues to a satten brestplate, is a garment good enough for a capitoll: but is master Wrangle, master Tangle, or master Trobleare of that opinion? in faith sir no.
                  Ther's neuer a gallant in our state
                  That goes more rich in gaudy brauery:
                  And yet I hope for quality of speech,
                  Audacious words or quirkes or quidities,
                  You are not held their much inferiour.
                  Fy, fy, I am asham'd to see your basenesse.
               
               
                  Co.
                  Indeede master Prate she telles you truly; I wonder that you being a proper man and an Orator will not go braue, according to the custome of the country.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  Go to neighbour, he that wil rise to the top of a high ladder must goe vp, not leape vp: but be patient wench, and thou shalt shortly see me gallant it with the best, and for thy selfe my Lollia,
                  
                  Not Lollia Paulina, nor those blasing starres,
                  Which makes the world the Apes of Italy:
                  Shall match thy selfe in sun-bright splendency.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Nay, verily for my selfe I care not, tis you that are my pride, if you would goe like your selfe I were appeasd.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  Beleeue it wench so I will, but to the purpose for which I came, the end of this great warre is now brought to a combate, two to two, the Duke of Epyre and Alphonso for our Queene against the King and Prince Philocles: now wench if thou wilt goe see the fight, I will send and prouide thee of a good standing.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Indeede, for you haue nere a good one of your owne.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  What, President I say?
               
               
                  Pre.
                  Anon, anon sir.
               
               
                  
                  Prate.
                  Why when I say, the villains bellie is like a bottomlesse pit, euer filling and yet emptie, at your leasure sir.
               
               Enter President Prates man eating.
               
                  Pre.
                  I can make no more haste then my teeth will giue mee leaue.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  Well sir, get you without the towne, to the place for the combate, and prouide me for my wife some good standing, to see the conflict.
               
               
                  Pre.
                  How master how, must I prouide a good standing for you for my mistresse? truly Master I thinke a mary bone pye, candi'd erringoes, preseru'd dattes, or marmaladd of cantharides were much better harbingers, cock sparrowes stew'd, doues braines or swannes pizels are very prouocatiue, roasted potatoes or boild skerrets are your onely lofty dishes, me thinks these should fit you better then I can doe.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  Whats this, whats this I say? prouide mee a standing for my wife vpon a scaffold.
               
               
                  Pre.
                  And truely Master, I thinke a priuat chamber were better.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  I graunt you, if there were a chamber conuenient.
               
               
                  Pre.
                  Willing minds will make shift in a simple hole, close windowes, strong locks, hard bed and sure posts, are your onely ornaments.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  I thinke the knaue be madde, sirra you chop logicke, blockhead, you that haue your braine panne made of dry leather, & your wit euer wetshod: pack about your businesse, or Ile pack your pen and inckhorne about your cares.
               
               
                  Pre.
                  Well sir, I may go or so, but would my mistresse take a standing of my preferment, I would so mount her, shee should loue strange things the better all her life after.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  Why when sir.

                  Of philters charmes, of nightspels characters,
                  Or other blacke infernall vantages,
                  But euen with thoughts as pure
                  As your pure vallures, or the sunnes pure beames,
                  T'approue the right of pure affection;
                  And howsoe're your fortunes rise or fall,
                  To breake no faith in your conditions,
                  So help you Ioue.

                  How often doth my maiden thoughts correct
                  And chide my froward will, for this extreame
                  Pursuit of bloud! beleeue me, faine I would
                  Recall mine oathes vow, did not my shame
                  Hold fast my cruelty, by which is taught
                  Those gems are prized best, are deerest bought,
                  Sleep my loues softnes then, waken my flame,
                  Which guards a vestall sanctity; Princes behold,
                  Vpon those weapons sits my God of loue,
                  And in their powers my loues seuerity.
                  If them you conquere, we are all your slaues,
                  If they triumph, weele mourne vpon your graues.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  Now by my maiden modesty I wish
                  Good fortune to that Philocles, my minde
                  Presages vertue, in his eaglets eies.
                  S'foot he lookes like a sparrow hauke, or a wanton fire
                  A flash of lightning, or a glimpse of day,
                  His eie steales to my heart, and lets it see
                  
                  More then it would, peace, blab no secresie,
                  He must haue blowes.
               
               
                  Flo.
                  Sound cornets, Princes respect your guards.
               
               Heere they fight, and Philocles ouerthrowes Alphonso, and Epyre ouerthrowes Cypres.
               
                  Phi.
                  I craue the Queenes conditions, or this blow
                  Sends this afflicted soule to heauen or hell.
                  Speake madame, will you yeeld or shall he die?
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Neither bould Prince, if thou but touch a haire,
                  The kings breath shall redeeme it: madame your loue
                  Is safe in angels guarding, let no feare
                  Shake hands with doubtfulnesse, you are as safe
                  As in a tower of Diamonds.

                  O t'is but glasse,
                  And cannot beare this axes massinesse.
                  Duke, thy braue words that second thy braue deedes,
                  Fils me with emulation, onely we two
                  Stand equall victors; then if thou hast that tie
                  And bond of well knit valure, which vnites
                  Vertue and same together, let vs restore
                  Our captiues vnto freedome, and we two,
                  In single combate trie out the mastery.
                  Where whoso falles each other, shall subscribe
                  To euery clause in each condition.

                  Thou art the index of mine ample thought,
                  And I am pleas'd with thine election.
                  Speake madame, if euer I deserued grace,
                  Grace me with your consent.

                  T'is all my will.
                  Thy noble hand erect and perfit me.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  What saies his maiesty?
                  My starres are writ in heauen, nor death nor fate
                  Are slaues to feare, to hope or human state.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  I neither feare thy fortune nor my ruine;
                  But hold them all beyond all prophesie.
                  
                  Thou hast my free consent, and on thy power
                  Lies my liues date or my deaths hower.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Then rise and liue with safety.

                     Alphonso, here my hand,
                  Thy fortune lends thy peace no infamy.
                  And now thou glorious issue of Ioues braine,
                  That burnt the Telamonian Rauisher,
                  Looke from thy spheare, and if my heart containe
                  An impure thought of lust, send thy monsters forth
                  And make me more then earthly miserable.
               
               Here the cornets sound, they fight, and Philocles ouercomes the Duke, the Queene defends.
               
                  Phi.
                  Yeld, recant or dye.

                  Thine axe hath not the power to wound my thought,
                  And yeelds a word my tongue could neuer sound,
                  I say th'art worthy valiant, for my death,
                  Let the Queene speake it, tis an easie breath.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  Not for the worlds large circuite, hold gentle Prince,
                  Thus I doe pay his ransome, lowe as the ground,
                  I tender mine vnspotted virgin loue,
                  To thy great willes commandement, let not my care
                  My woman tyrannie, or too strict guard,
                  In bloudy purchase take away those sweetes
                  Till now haue gouernd your amazd desires:
                  For trust me king, I will redeeme my blame,
                  With as much loue, as Philocles hath fame.

                  Thus comes a calme vnto a Sea-wract soule,
                  Ease to the pained, foode vnto the staru'd,
                  As you to me my best creation.

                  Thou neuer shalt ore read, because each day
                  It shall beget new matter of amaze:
                  And liue to doe thee grace eternally,
                  Next whom my Philocles my bounteous friend,
                  
                  Author of life, and soueraigne of my loue,
                  My heart shall be thy throne, thy breast the shrine,
                  Where I will sit to study gratefulnes
                  To you and you my Lords, my best of thoughts,
                  Whose loues haue shewd a dutious carefulnes,
                  To all free thankes and graces, this vnity
                  Of loue and kingdomes, is a glorious sight.
                  Mount vp the royal Champion, musicke & cornets sound.

                  How like the sunnes great bastard ore the world,
                  Rides this man mounted engine, this proud prince
                  And with his breath sindges our continents
                  Sit fast proud Phaeton, for by heauen ile kicke
                  And plunge thee in the sea: if thou'lt needes ride,
                  Thou shouldst haue made thy seat vpon a slaue,
                  And not vpon mine honours firmament.
                  Thou hast not heard the God of wisedomes tale,
                  Nor can thine youth curbe greatnes, till my hate,
                  Confound thy life with villaine policy.
                  I am resolu'd since vertue hath disdaind
                  To cloath me in her riches, henceforth to proue
                  A villaine fatall, blacke and ominous:
                  Thy vertue is the ground of my dislike:
                  And my disgrace, the edge of enuies sword,
                  Which like a rasor shall vnplumbe thy crest;
                  And rob thee of thy natiue excellence,
                  When great thoughts giue their homage to disgrace
                  Thers's no respect of deedes, time, thoughts or place.

                  Pres.
                  Indeed they were stiffe whilest they stood, but when they

were downe, they were like men of a low world, a man might haue wound their worst anger about his finger.
               
               
                  Lol.

                  Indeed mistresse, if my master should breake his arrow with foule shooting or so, I would bee glad if mine might supply the whole.

                  Goe to sirra, you will bee obscene, and then I shall knocke you; but to the combate, me thought our side were the more proper men.
               
               
                  Lol.
                  True, and therefore thoy had the worse fortune: but see heere is the Lord Florio.

                  Wife you can haue my seruice no longer. Sirra, President, attend you vpon your mistresse home: and wife, I would haue you to hold your iourney directly homeward, and not to imitate princes in their progresse, step not out of your way to visit a new gossip, to see a new garden-house, to smell the perfumes of Court ierkins, or to handle other tooles then may fit for your modestie: I would not haue you to step into the Suburbs, and acquaint your selfe either with monsters or motions, but holding your way directly homeward, shew your selfe still to bee a rare houswife.

                  Faith my Lord I haue done my best to make somebody relish your sweet meates; but harke you my Lord, I haue strucke the stroak, I haue done the deed, there wants nothing but time, place and her consent.

                  To enioy my loue, is not to possesse my body.

                  Alp.
                  S'foot, thou shouldest but do for him as he does for the whole world; why an Orator were a needle name, if it were not to defend wrong: then wench, do as he doth, write by a president.

                  From the intelligence of his secret spies.
                  I am a very toward Danae

                  The rather sith it euer hath beene said,
                  That walles of brasse withstand not willing mindes:
                  And women when th'are prone make loue admir'd:
                  For quaint indeuours, come instruct thy wit:
                  And finde some scale to our hie hight of blisse.

                  My loue should thus betray my modesty;
                  But make the vse according to your fancy.

                  Night clad in blacke mournes for the losse of day,
                  
                  And hides the siluer spangles of the aire,
                  That not a sparke is left to light the world,
                  Whil'st quiet sleep the nourisher of life
                  Takes full possession on mortality.
                  All creatures take their rest in soft repose
                  Saue malecontents, and we accursed louers,
                  Whose thoughts perturbed, makes vs passions slaue:

                  And a fine straight leg'd Gentleman Vsher,
                  The preface to a kirtill all puffe past.
                  One that writes sonnets in his Ladies praise,

                  A word of least vse in a virgins breath,
                  Vrge not my patience then with fond reply.

                  Yet we must seeke that naught their sight displeases,
                  And mixe our wedlock sweetes with loathd diseases:

                  All our reward is why, t'was but our duty.

                  That humour like a flower soone will fade,

                  Till loue and you reformd my barbarousnesse:
                  Therefore deere Lady, pitty my wounded heart.

                  O do not leaue me, grant me but one request,
                  And here I vow by that diuinest power,
                  The salt-seas glorious issue, whose bright spheare
                  Rules my sick heart, and knowes my chast intent,
                  That if you please t'impose on me that taske
                  Which neither men nor monster can atchieue,
                  Which euen Angels haue a dread to touch,
                  Deedes which outstretch all possibility,
                  S'foot more then can be thought, and i'le effect,

                  Let your request fit virgin modesty,
                  And you obey your vow, I am content
                  To giue your thoughts contented happinesse,

                  Thy life thou shalt not hazard for my loue,
                  Nor will I tie thee to an endlesse taske,
                  But euen with ease, and gentle rangled knots,
                  Thou shalt vntwind thy clew of miseries,

                  Ma.
                  Then Philocles knit silence to my words,
                  And marke thy doome: for thus my strickter will
                  
                  Loads griefe vpon thy vainer leuity.
                  Hence for the space and compasse of one yeare
                  Thou shalt abiure the liberty of speech,
                  Thou shalt not speake for fully twelue months space,
                  For friend nor foe, for danger nor for death;
                  But liue like aire, with silent emptinesse.
                  Breake thou this vow, i'le hold thee for a villaine:
                  And all the world shall know thy periury.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  Be heauen and earth a witnesse of my vow,
                  And mine eternall silence, I am dumbe.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  Why so, now shal I not be troubled with vaine chat
                  Or idle prate of idle wantonnesse:
                  For loue I cannot, therefore tis in vaine,
                  Would all my sutors tongues I thus could raine,
                  Then should I liue free from faind sighes and groanes,
                  With O take pitty, tis your seruant moanes,
                  And such harsh stuffe, that frets me to the heart:
                  And sonnets made of Cupids burning dart.
                  Of Venus lip, and Iunoes maiestie.
                  Then were I freed from fooles and foolerie.
                  In May the cuckoe sings, then sheel'e come hither,
                  Her voice and yours will rarely tune together.
               
               Exit Mariana. Enter Florio.
               
                  Flo.
                  Prince Philocles, the king would speake with you:
                  Speakes louder & louder.
                  Prince Philocles, the king would speake with you,
                  Prince Philocles, the king would speake with you.
               
               Philocles strikes Florio and fels him.
               
                  Flo.
                  The pox rot off your fingers for this blow,
                  It is coronation day, thorow all my scull,
                  Theres such a fatall ringing in my braine,
                  Has woone the selt, has laid fiue fingers on;
                  But twas a knauish part of him to play so.
                  Heare me you Gods for this my open wrong,
                  Make short his fingers as you haue his tongue.
               
               Exit Flo.
               Enter Meshant alone:
               
                  Me.
                  Tis not mans fortune, enuy or neglect,
                  
                  Which makes him miserable, but tis meane fate,
                  Euen sole predestination, a firme gift,
                  Fixt to his birth, before the world was made,
                  For were it otherwise, then within our liues,
                  We should finde some distractions, errours change.
                  And other toies of much vncertaintie:
                  But my mishaps are fixt so to my blood,
                  They haue no sire but my creation:
                  The Queene out of suspition that my loue,
                  First set an edge vpon the Kings desires,
                  And made him wooe her with a victors sword,
                  Casts me from fauour, seazes all my lands,
                  And turnes my naked fortunes to the cold.
                  The King made proud with purchase of his wish
                  Neglects my sufferance for him, and ore lookes,
                  The low-tide of my fortunes; lest my woes
                  Should speake my wrongs to his ingratitude;
                  The whil'st those lords whose supple hams haue bow'd
                  To doe me formal reuerence, now despise
                  And sleight me in their meanest compliments:
                  O tis a torment more then hell yet knowes
                  To be an honest flatterer, or to liue
                  A saint in Limbo, which that I may preuent,
                  Ile be nor best nor worst, but all indifferent.
                  But here comes a noble man, I must turne petitioner.
                  Enter Florio.
                  My Lord, may I not see the king?
               
               
                  Flo.
                  You may not.
                  His maiestie is now downe prest with seriousnesse:
                  As for your suit it is with Prat the Orator.
                  I heard his highnesse giue him a speciall charge
                  For your dispatch with fauour.
               
               
                  Me.
                  O but he doth neglect,
                  And sleights me like his weake orations,
                  And by your Lordships leaue, I do not thinke
                  His wisedome worthy of the conference.
               
               
                  Flo.
                  Nay if you will correct the kings coyne you are not for my conference,

Fare you well.
               
               Exit Florio.
               
                  Me.
                  Why, and fare you well, S'foot this is more then strange,
                  That being grieu'd I may not say i'me paind.
                  Enter Alphonso.
                  But heere comes another: Mine honorable Lord
                  May I not haue some conference with the king?
               
               
                  Alp.
                  You may not, businesse of greater waight
                  Imports both him and vs: nay pray you cease;
                  As for your suit tis with the Orator.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Yet methinkes twere meet
               
               
                  Alp.
                  That you would rather trouble him then me.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Its strange.
               
               
                  Alp.
                  Its strange indeed, to see you wrong your ease.
                  I am not now for idle conferences, adiew.
               
               Exit Alph.
               
                  Me.
                  Why this is court grace to men in misery,
                  And thus these taile-lesse Lions with their roare,
                  Affright the simple heard: O I could now
                  Turne rebell gainst their pride.
                  Enter Epire.
                  But heere comes the Duke:
                  My gratious Lord, vouchsafe to heare my griefes.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  For Gods loue cease your trouble, wee are all
                  Troubled with griefes of stranger qualities.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Words are no heauy burthen.
               
               
                  Epy
                  No, had I no other waight;
                  But we are all downe prest with other poise:
                  As for your suit it is refer'd to Prat:
                  
                  And he must giue you faire dispatch with fauour;
                  VVhich if he sleight for enuy or for bribe,
                  Repaire to me, and I will not forget
                  To giue you ease, and chide his negligence.
                  Meane space I pray you leaue me, for we all
                  Are troubled now with greatest miracles.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Your grace doth do me comfort, and I will
                  Study with seruice to deserue your fauours,
                  And so I take my leaue.
               
               Exit Mershant. Enter 2 Doctors.
               
                  Epy.
                  Your owne content
                        •…
                     ts follow you.
                  Now gentlemen what newes within, can this dumbe wonder speake?
                  
                  Haue you cut off those lets that tied his speech.
                  And made your fame to sound thorow Sicille?
               
               
                  
                     1 Doct.
                  All hopefull meanes that man or art can finde,
                  Haue we made triall of, but tis in vaine:
                  For still my Lord, the cur'es invincible.
               
               
                  
                     2 Doct.
                  Those Organs nature gaue to moue the tongue,
                  He fully doth possesse as well as we;
                  Which makes vs thinke his suddaine apoplexe,
                  Is either will, vow, or a miracle.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  I should thinke strangly, had wee strange things on earth;
                  But wonders now are most familiar:
                  But here comes his maiestie, now we shall see
                  If this dumbe beast can speake before the king.
               
               Cornets, and enter Cypres, Queene Philoclas, Mariana and attendants.
               
                  Cyp.
                  My best of friends, my deerest Philocles,
                  
                  Thy griefes run in my spirit, make me sad,
                  And duls my sense with thine affliction.
                  My soule with thine doth sympathize in woe,
                  And passion gouerns him that should rule all.
                  What say our Doctors is there no hope of help?
               
               
                  
                     1 Doct.
                  No hope my Lord, the cure is desperate.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  Then I am king of greife, for in his words
                  Found I more musicke then in quires of Angels,
                  It was as siluer as the chime of spheares.
                  The breath of Lutes, or ioues deliciousnesse:
                  Next to my Queene, he is my ioy on earth:
                  Nor shall the world containe that happy good
                  Which with my teares I will not wooe for him.
                  My Lord of Epyre, let it be straight proclaim'd
                  Thorow all the cities in our kingdomes verdge,
                  That who so will avow to cure this prince,
                  And bring his worke to wisht effectualnesse
                  Shall haue ten thousand crownes and our best loue;
                  
                  But if he faile in his great enterprise,
                  His daring is the losse of present life,
                  Since no man hitherto could doe him good,
                  The next shall help him or else loose his bloud.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Your Maiesty shall haue your will performd.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  Not all so soone deare brother, what if a womā now
                  Should turne Aesculapius and restore
                  This dumbe Hypolitus? nay do not looke strange,
                  I dare auow and vndertake the cure.

                  You sister, are you in your wits?
               
               
                  Ma.
                  Faith of the out side of them brother, yet a womās tongue
                  Whose burthen still is superfluity,
                  May lend a man an ages complement.

                  Madam I would not haue you with the barke
                  Play your selfe into day net, this great cure,
                  I feare is farre beyond your Physicks helpe.

                  My Lord, you know not how Apollo loues me,
                  I haue beene thought as faire as Oenon was,
                  And dare be bold to claime this miracle.
               
               
                  Cy.
                  
                     Mariana attend, glory & ruine compasse thee about
                  This hand shall raise thee to a golden throne,
                  And grace thee with all stiles of dignity;
                  This cast thee downe.
                  Lower then liues misfortune and orewhelme
                  Thy beauties with thy graue, performe be great,
                  Faile and be worse then worst calamitie.
               
               
                  Que.
                  Stay gentle friend, my loue doth bid thee stay,
                  Attempt not, and be safe from misery.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Sister you shall not graspe with mischiefe thus,
                  My bloud doth challenge interest in your ill,
                  And I coniure you from this desperatnes.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  Brother content your selfe, words but augment our strife,
                  I will performe or else my pawn's my life.

                  Proceed faire virgin.

                  Vouchsafe me priuacy: now Venus be my speed,
                  Speake gentle Philocles, thine oaths bond I vntie
                  
                  And giue thy vowes a free infranchisment,
                  Thy well kept league hath show'd thy strength of truth,
                  And doth confirme me in my vertuousnesse:
                  Thy martyrdome and sufferance is too long,
                  And I restore it to new liberty.
                  Then speake my Philocles, speak gentle Prince

                  No hope is left, deare Philocles regard my miseries.
                  Vntie that wilfull let which holds in speech,
                  And make me happy through thy noble pity.
                  I see the face of mine ill shapt contempt,
                  Where like with like hath quit most iniury:
                  Then speake my Lord, vtter one Angell breath
                  To giue me ioy, and saue me from strange death.
                  What not a word, hath this small silence brought
                  An vtter detestation to thy speech?
                  Wilt thou nor heare, nor speak, nor pity me,
                  The gentle Gods moue thee to more remorse.
               
               
                  Cy.
                  What, wilt not be?
                  Fond maid thou hast drawne affliction on thy head,
                  And thrald thy selfe to worst calamity:
                  Till morrow sunne thy incantations vse,
                  But then effectlesse, all hopes desperate,
                  Wert thou my bosome loue thou diest the death,
                  Best ease for madnesse is the losse of breath.

                  O Philocles I am no courts disgrace,
                  No cities Prostitution, countries shame,
                  Nor one shall bring Troys fire vnto thy house,
                  Turne not away hard harted Mirmidon,
                  
                  See, on my knees Ile follow thee in court,
                  And make the world condemne thy cruelty:
                  Yet if my teares may mollifie thy heart,
                  Receiue them as the floods of strangest rides,
                  Turne not thy face from her that doates on thee,
                  
                  Loue now hath made me subiect to thy will,
                  And pale disdaine hath tane reuenge on me.
                  Behold my nerues Ile weare vpon this earth,
                  And fill this roofe with lamentations.
                  What dost thou smile, hath fury so much sway
                  As euen to banish poore ciuilitie?
                  Then be thy selfe, and breake thine itching spleene:
                  For I disdaine thy ransomes victorie,
                  Life thou art weary brought, welcome my death,
                  Sweet because wisht for, good because my choice:
                  Yet when I am dead, this of me shall be said,
                  A cruell Prince murdered a louing maid.
                  And after ages to th'unborne shall tell,
                  Thy hate, my loue, thy enuie and my hell.
                  Nay do not speak I charge thee, go let nothing moue thee,
                  Death is my glory, since thou wilt not loue me.

                  GRiefe which controles the motions of our thoughts,
                  Raines in my bloud and makes me passions slaue,
                  My sisters miserie torments my soule,
                  And breaks my gall when I but thinke of her:
                  She was bewicht with spelles to her misfortune,
                  Or else borne haplesse vnder a lowring starre,
                  And tis her fate to be thus miserable:
                  O Philocles hadst thou no other scale
                  To mount thy heauen but by our miseries,
                  Must all the noble fame of our great house
                  Waste downe her royall pillars to make steps
                  For thee to climbe to glory? well I see
                  Thou plots our shames in thy great dignity.

                  Patience great Lord, me thinkes these ill raisd stormes
                  Haue not more violence then may be borne,
                  Come we will both go sue vnto the King.
                  
                  We there will kneele and pray eternally,
                  And neuer rise till he remit his dome:
                  It shall be so, I will vnto the King,
                  To beg great fauour for a small offence:
                  But if she dy for this, then King take heede,
                  Thee and thy fortunes by this hand shall bleed.
               
               Exeunt.
               Enter Chyp, Shauenig and others with a Scaffold.

                  Its a signe she deales with sharp tooles & a cruell heads man.
               
               
                  Chy.
                  If I had beene her iudge, she should haue beene tost to death in a blanket.
               
               
                  Sha.
                  No, I would haue had her smothered in a featherbed.
               
               
                  Chy.
                  They say she would not pleade at her triall.
               
               
                  Sha.
                  No thats true, for she had a great desire to be prest.
               
               
                  Chy.
                  And I haue knowne some of her sex, haue got that fauor to be prest for speaking.
               
               
                  Sha.
                  Then she was vnwise to hold her tongue being a woman.
               
               
                  Chy.
                  What is her crime that she must loose her head?
               
               
                  Sha.
                  Because she liued honest, contrary to the statute.
               
               
                  Chy.
                  There is a great number of my neighbors wll neuer suffer for that fault.

                  No nor thou neither if the truth were knowne, for my part I shunne that danger.
               
               
                  Chy.
                  I thinke we are all out of danger of the lawe for that crime.
               
               
                  Sha.
                  I know I am free, for I am a knaue if I haue not forgot what wench had my maiden head.

                  Mercy is banisht courts, the King like flint,
                  Hardens his royall temper gainst our plaints,
                  And makes our woes most vnauoidable.
                  What inauspicious starre raignd at her birth,
                  
                  That heauen thus frownes vpon her misery;
                  And my good Lord, now innocence must die.
                  As white as vntroade snow, or culuer downe,
                  Kings words are lawes, and cannot be withstood;
                  Yet t'is false greatnesse, which delights in blood.
               
               
                  Alph.
                  Patience my Lord, I do not thinke this ill
                  Is yet so big as vnrecouerable.
                  The king doth hold you in most choice respect,
                  And whom kings loue, they study to oblige.
                  Then call your reason home, make not this ciuill ware,
                  To suffer makes woes lesser then they are.

                  How wel the sound can salue the sicke-mans griefe!
                  But O how ill he can disgest his pils!
                  O my good Lord, you shall not lose a sister,
                  That is the ioy and comfort of your breath,
                  T'is not your bloud shall issue from her wound,
                  But mine that runs in riuers from her teares:
                  And rounds my face in her calamitie.
                  Well, let her perish, since her soule is cleare,
                  And for her death, ile make a massacrie.
               
               Enter Cypres, Queene, Philocles, Mariana bound, a guard of halberts and an Executioner.

                  Your suits are bootlesse: for my vowes haue glewd
                  And closd mine eares that they retaine no sound
                  Of your intreaties, and euen now the time
                  Doth run vpon his latest minutes, and
                  Saue but by speech, theres no recouery.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  Haue mercy good my Lord, O let my teares intrude
                  Betwixt your vowes and her calamitie.
                  In her you take from me my best of life,
                  My ioy, my comfort and my play-fellow.

                  Content you madame, for my vow is past,
                  And is like fate still vnreuocable:
                  Ascend poore modell of calamity.
               
               
                  
                  Ma.
                  As lightly burdened with the waight of crimes,
                  As spotesse infants, or poore harmlesse lambes,
                  Thus I ascend my heauen, this first step lower,
                  Mounts to this next, this, thus and thus hath brought
                  My bodies frame vnto its highest throne;
                  Heere doth her office end, and hence my soule
                  With golden wings of thought shall mount the skie,
                  And reap a palace of pure sanctitie.
                  Farewell my soueragine, madame within your thoughts
                  Make me a tombe, and loue my memory.
                  Brother farewell, nay do not mourne my death,
                  It is not I that die to spot our house,
                  Or make you liue in after obloquy.
                  Then weep no more, but take my last adiew,
                  My vertues not my faults preserue with you.
                  Lastly, to you that are my last of hope,
                  Nay do not hide your eies, I loue them still:
                  To part friends now is greatest charitie.
                  O be thy dayes as fruitfull in delights,
                  As Eden in choice flowers, thine honours such
                  As all the world may striue to imitate.
                  Be master of thy wishes: onely this,
                  When the sad nurse to still the wrangling babe,
                  Shall sing the carefull story of my death,
                  Giue me a sigh, from thy hearts purest breath:
                  And so farewell.

                  With all my heart, thou art but lawes poore hand,
                  Thus to my death I bowe, and yet arise,
                  Angels protect my spirits in the skies.

                  You are not charitable vnto my moanes,
                  Thus to afflict me with a double punishment:
                  One death for one poore fault might well suffice,
                  They are most wretched who twice liues and dies.

                  Blacke periury that open eied disease,
                  Which is the plague sore of society,
                  Brands me with mischiefe, and protests I hold
                  Nothing within me but vnworthinesse:
                  And all these ils are your creation.

                  My faith, my seruice, and my loialtie,
                  Shall as thy slaues attend on thy commands,

                  A wretch deformd in nature, loath'd of men
                  Then her that hath bemonster'd my pure soule,
                  Her scorne and pride had almost lost her life,
                  A maid so faulted, seldome proues' good wife.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  What is the reason you not loue her now,
                  And were so passionate in loue before?
               
               
                  Phi.
                  Not that I loue her lesse, but rather more,
                  Run I this backward course; onely my vow,
                  Sith vnperform'd craues satisfaction;
                  Which thus I reconcile, when this faire maide,
                  Shall with as strong a loue, as firme a zeale,
                  
                  A Faith as constant, and a shame as strong,
                  Requit my care, and shew as ample proofe
                  In mine extreames, as I haue in her death,
                  Then will I loue, enioy and honour her.
                  Till when, I will not think a louing thought;
                  Or giue the easie temper of my minde
                  To loue-sicke passion, or delitiousnesse.
                  Onely with those which do adore the sunne,
                  I'le giue her all respect and reuerence,
               
               
                  Ma.
                  I am well pleas'd, and with a doubtfull foe,
                  You haue good reason thus to capitulate,
                  Then hang your colours forth, extēd your thought
                  Muster your strongest powers, of stricktest wit,
                  And when your reasons best artilleries bent
                  Loue not my loue, if it be not excellent.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  I haue not seene a warre breed better wit,
                  Or passion draw on more delightfulnesse:
                  Proceed in your contention, for we boast,
                  That loue is best, which is approued most.
                  But now to reuels, since our tragicke sceane
                  Is turnd to comicke mirthfull constancie;
                  In stead of mourning we will daunce and banquet
                  And fill our emptie veines with all delights:
                  For oft we find that stormes and sorrowes proue
                  The best forerunners of a happy loue.
               
               Exeunt all but Epyre.
               
                  Epy.
                  He will, but he will not, loues but cannot like,
                  Will and affection in this Prince are like
                  Two buckets which do neuer both ascend:
                  Or those star twins which shine not in one spheare.
                  O Philoceles, I see thy soule growes fat,
                  And feeds vpon the glories of my same;
                  But I'le forestall thine Epileptique fits;
                  And by my plots breed thy destruction.
                  Reuenge now rules as soueragine of my bloud,
                  And others ruines shall aduance my good.
                  
                  VVhich once attaind to, I will proue ambitious,
                  Great men like Gods, are nere thought-vitious.
                  Now Philocles stand fast, King guard thy crowne,
                  For by this braine, you both shall tumble downe.
               
               Exit.
               Enter Veloups and Drap. President sitting at his deske.

                  He is very busie in his study.
                  Feed where thou wilt, in mountaine or on dale.
                  Stay a while he will come out anon.
                  Graze on my lips, and when those mounts are drie,
                  Stray lower where the pleasant fountaines lie.
                  Go thy way thou best booke in the world.

                  Pre.
                  A book that neuer an Orators clarke in this kingdome but is beholden vnto; it is called maides philosophie, or Venus and Adonis: Looke you gentlemen, I haue diuers other pretty bookes.
               
               
                  Drap.
                  You are very well storde sir, but I hope your master wil not stay long.

                  Saue you Gentlemen; sir is your master at any leasure?

                  VVe must attend, vm, euen snailes keep state
                  VVhen with slow thrust their hornes peep forth the gate.
                  VVe must attend, tis customs fault not mine
                  To make men proud, on whom great fauours shine,
                  Its somewhat gainst my nature to attend.
                  
                  But when we must, we must be patient,
                  A man may haue admittance to the king
                  As soone as to these long roabes, and as cheap.
                  Come gentlemen shall we walke?
                  Thus are the pauement stones before the doores
                  Of these great tongue guilt Orators, worne smoth
                  With clients dauncing for them.

                  It's strange to see how the world waits vpon them, therein they are the onely men now.
               
               
                  Me.
                  O onely; they of all men in request.
                  Your physitian is the lawier for your health:
                  And moderate vnruly humours best.
                  Others are no body compard with him:
                  For all men neglect their health in regard of their profit.
               
               
                  Dra.
                  True, and thats it makes these men grow so fat,
                  Swell with rich purchases.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Yea with golden fees,
                  And golden titles too, they can worke miracles,
                  And like creators, euen of emptie nothing
                  Erect a world of goodly liuings, faire demeanes,
                  And gallant mannors, heapt one on another.
               
               
                  Ve.
                  They gaine indeed excessiuely, & are not like vs citizens
                  Expos'd to hazard of the seas and trafficke.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Why heres a fellow now, this Orator
                  Euen Prat, you would little thinke it, his father was
                  An honest proiner of our cuntry vines;
                  Yet hee's shot to his foot-cloath.
               
               
                  Drap.
                  O hee is; hee proind him well and brought him vp to learning.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Faith reasonable learning, a smattring in the Latine tongue,
                  A little Rhetoricke, with wrangling sophistrie,
                  Were his preparatiues vnto his art.
               
               
                  Ve.
                  After these preparatiues (if you call them so)
                  The physicke wrought well for a few yeares practise,
                  Brought him in wondrous credit, and preferments
                  Came tumbling in: O such a suddaine rise,
                  
                  Hath fortune for her minions, blame him not then,
                  Though he looke high on't.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Nay for his pride, of weaker soules tearmd state,
                  It hurts none but himselfe.
               
               
                  Dra.
                  Yet to my seeming it is very strange,
                  That from so base beginning, men can breath
                  Such soaring fames.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Srange; it's not strange a whit,
                  Dunghils and marrish bogs, dart store of vapours,
                  And viscous exhalations, against heauen,
                  Which borrowing luster there (though basly bred)
                  Seeme yet like glorious planets fairest starres:
                  To the weake eies of wondring ignorance,
                  When wise men know they are but Meteors.
                  
                  But here comes the Orator.
               
               Enter Prate.
               
                  Prat.
                  What President I say, come and attend me to the senate house.
               
               
                  Pre.
                  I am ready sir, if you haue Copia verborum, I haue Copia rerum in a buckram bagge here.
               
               
                  Prat.
                  Your Lordships pleasure.

                  Nay your Lordship must be briefe, I not attend
                  The shallow sleight of words, your suit, your suit.
               
               
                  Me.
                  The restoration of my lands and honours.

                  Me.
                  My lands confiscat, and my body free?
               
               
                  Prat.
                  My Lord, my Lord, the Queen's more mercifull.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Sir, you forget my place.
               
               
                  Pra.
                  Sir you forget your faith,
                  T'was knowne vnto the Queene, the state and vs,
                  Your malecontented spirit, your disease in duty:
                  Your diligent purturbance of the peace:
                  Your passages, occurrences and—
               
               
                  Me.
                  Sir.
               
               
                  Prat.
                  Sir me no sirs.
                  Do not I know you were the chiefe of those
                  Which raisd the warres in Sicill? and long since
                  
                  Wrought in the kings loues bloody businesse.
                  Did not you hold faire quarter and commerce
                  VVith all the spies of Cypres? fie I am asham'd,
                  Blinde impudence should make you be so bold,
                  To beare your face before authority.
               
               
                  Me.
                  But heare me.
               
               
                  Pra.
                  I will heare no reply, go home, repent, pray & die.
                  Come Gentlemen, what's your businesses?
               
               
                  Ve.
                  Your confirmation to his highnesse grant, touching our trade with Spaine, in which if it please you to assist vs, wee haue a thousand crownes which shall attend you.
               
               
                  Pra.
                  O I haue you in my memory, the suit is great:
                  And I must squeisse forth more then a thousand crownes.
                  Wel attend me to the senate, you shal haue faire dispatches
               
               Exeunt all but Meshant..
               
                  Me.
                  I not attend the shallow sleight of words,
                  Go home repent, pray and die.
                  Excellent precepts for an Orators chamber.
                  VVhere speech must bath a handful deep in gold,
                  Till the poore giuers conduit being drie,
                  The wretch goes home, doth curse, repent and die.
                  It is thy counsaile Orator, thy tale breath
                  Good onely but to season infamie.
                  From this reproch, this incarressing humour
                  Hath taught my soule a new philosophie.
                  I will goe home and there repent all good
                  Done to thy name or thy profession.
                  I will go home and there new frame my selfe
                  More thirstily pernicious to thy state,
                  Then warre or vnabated mutiny.
                  As for my praiers Orator, they are for thee;
                  Thou hast a pretty, louely, witty wife:
                  O maist thou liue, both to be knowne and know
                  Thy selfe the greatest cuckold in our land;
                  And yet not dare to amend or greiue at it.
                  Maist thou imbrace thy shame with thankful armes,
                  
                  Hugge thy disgrace, make thy black poison wine,
                  And cap and crouch to thy dishonor,
                  May thy remembrance liue, vpon my knees I pray,
                  All night in belmens mouthes, with Pasquill in the day.
               
               Enter Alphonso vnbrac't.
               
                  Alp.
                  Day be my speede, night shall not cloake my sin,
                  If I haue naught to doe, its by the Sunne,
                  The light giues leaue to all mine Idlenes.
                  Quick businesse and ope eies cease on mine orator,
                  Whilst I create him horny presidents.
                  Enter Coloquintida.
                  But heeres my bed broker. Now my great armefull of good intelligence, where is my Mistresse?
               
               
                  Co.
                  Fast lockt in her bed with a close ward to deuoure thee my braue Paraquito; but husht no words, there is a calme before the tempest.
               
               
                  Alp.
                  Tut, tell me of no stormes, but direct me to her bed chamber, my noble firelock of a flesh pistoll.
               
               
                  Co.
                  Follow thy colours my braue worthy, mount vp thy standard, so enter and prosper.
                  She puts Alph. into the Orators house.
                  Thou hast a rich roome, safe locks, sweete sheetes, a choice armefull, with ô the rare, rare thought of imagination.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Whats this, whats this, doth this Lord Alphonso turne the
                  Orator to an Antilop? tis more then excellent,
                  And from the iuice of this despight I suck
                  Delight more great then all my miseries,
                  Obserue, deare eies obserue.
               
               
                  Co.
                  Nay go thy way for a Camell or a Camelion, thou maist compare with all Europe, Africke and Asia, and one that will change tricks, though thou wert worthy to be schoolmaster either to Proteus or Aritine: what an excellent gift did God giue vnto man when he gaue him woman, but how much more when that woman was made faire? but ô the most of all when she had wit to vse euery member of her creation. Well Ile stand to it, theirs nothing but beautie, vse and old age that puts weomen of my ranck out of request, and yet like old bucklers though fewe of your gallant cauileres will weare vs, yet many of your stale Ruffins will imploy vs, and thats our comfort still.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Was euer heard a baude more damnable?
                  
                  A very mountebanke of wench flesh, an Emperick,
                  A dog-leech for the putrefied sores,
                  Of these Iust-cankerd great ones, O I could
                  Euen mad my selfe with railing at their vices.
                  Prate knocks at the dore.
                  But hearke one knocks, O for the orator,
                  Heauens I beseech thee, O for the orator.
               
               
                  Co.
                  How now, who knocks so rudely at the dore?
               
               
                  Pra.
                  Tis I I say, open the dore, I am in hast.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Tis he, iust heauens tis he, fore God the orator.

                  Soule of my bawdie office, how are wee betraid,
                  Anon, anon sir, what Mistres Prate I say?

                  I come, I come, Lord God how dull you are
                  When danger's at your heeles, rise quickly.
               
               
                  Pra.
                  Open the dore, or I wil breake it ope.
               
               
                  Co.
                  I come, I come, I thinke hee's mad with hast,
                  What Iohn, what Thomas, Robert, wher's these knaues,
                  What Iulian, Mary, Sislie, neere a maid within.

                  Enter Lollia and Alphonso in his shirt.
                  O mistres Coloquintida, what shall become of vs?
               
               
                  Co.
                  Nay I am at my wits end, and am made
                  Duller then any spurgald, tired Iade.

                  Did euer slaue come thus vnluckily?
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Nay now's no time for passion, good Lord in.
               
               Exit Alph. and enter Prate.
               
                  Co.
                  Fy I haue almost broke my hart with running.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  How now deare husbād, what hath moued this hast?
               
               
                  Pra.
                  I thinke I was not blest this morning when I rose: for through my forgetfulnes I haue left behind me in my study the breuiates of all my causes, and now the Senat is faine to daunce attendance on my leasure, fy, fy, fy.
               
               Exit Prate.
               
                  Lo.
                  Nay if he smell nothing but papers, I care not for his dry foote

hunting, nor shall I neede to puffe pepper in his nostrils, but see hee comes againe.
               
               Enter Prate, and stumbling at his wiues bed, sees Alphonsos rich apparell lying thereon.
               
                  Pra.
                  I thinke the Diuell haue laid his hornes in my way.
               
               
                  Me.
                  Yes, and if you had wit you might coniure him out of your wiues closet.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  
                     Sancte benedicite, what haue we heere, hath the golden snake cast his skinne vpon my bed, go toe wife, I smell I smell, mee thinkes your plaine rug should not agree with this rich counterpoint.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Husband, either I haue fitted you now, or else I shall neuer fit you whilst I breath.
                  You oft haue told me, that like those of your ranke,
                  Who both adorne their credits and them selues,
                  Yea euen their causes with their costly cloaths,
                  Your selfe in like sort would striue to imitate,
                  And now my neighbour heere hath brought this suite,
                  Which if you please to buy, tis better cheape
                  Then ere t'was made by full fiue thousand crownes.
               
               
                  Prate.
                  Saist thou me so wench, a kisse for that ifaith,
                  Fore God it is a delicate fine suite, rich stuffe, rare worke, and of the newest fashion; nay if the Senats businesse were neuer so hasty, I will stay to try it on, come, help good wenches helpe, so there, there there.
               
               The Orator puts on Alphonsos apparell.
               
                  Me.
                  Sfoote will the oxe put on the Lions hyde,
                  He will, he will, tis more then excellent,
                  So guild the tombe which holds but rottennes,
                  Laughter I feare will burst me, looke how hee struts,
                  O God that euer any man should looke
                  Vpon this maumet and not laugh at him,
               
               
                  Prate.
                  Fit fit: excellent fit as though,
                  The body it was made for wore my mould,
                  Wife I will haue it, weele dispute no price.
               
               Enter Velons.
               
                  Ve.
                  Master Orator, the Senat are set, and can dispatch no causes through your absence, therfore they earnestly intreat your presence.
               
               
                  
                  Pra.
                  I come, I come, good friend go say I come,
                  And wife see that you pay for this suite, what so ere it cost.
               
               Ex. Pra.
               
                  Me.
                  Not aboue making you cuckold, thats the most.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  What is he gone?
               
               
                  Co.
                  He is.
               
               Enter Alphonso in his shirt.
               
                  Lo.
                  Why then come forth poore naked Lord.
               
               
                  Alp.
                  What is he gone, may the Diuell and his hornes both follow him.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  He is gone: but yet he hath discouered your treason.
               
               
                  Alp.
                  How?
               
               
                  Co.
                  Yes, and in reuenge thereof hath vow'd, that in this naked sort as you are, you shall doe penance through the Citie for your sinne of vnchastitie.
               
               
                  Alp.
                  I pray thee leaue thy womans phrase, and speake like a man, plainly, plainly.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Then plainly thus, he is gone and hath taken away your apparell.
               
               
                  Alp.
                  Vpon what accident?
               
               
                  Lo.
                  This, when your negligence had left your cloathes vpon my bed, he espied them, taskt me for the owner, I in excuse told him it was a suite brought by my gossip to be sold, hee straight like a childe proud of a new coate, presently puts it on, presently is sent for to the Senat, and at this present hath left you that the world may behold your naked doings.
               
               
                  Alp.
                  I would it were washt in the bloud of a Centaure, that when he puts it off, his skinne might follow it, but how shall I get to my chamber?
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Truly I know not, except you wil weare a smocks vpper-coate.
               
               
                  Alp.
                  What a petticote, you mad me with your mirth.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Then seriously thus, as he hath tane your cloathes, you must take his, and let the world know you haue had more then fidlers fare, for you haue meat, money and cloth.
               
               
                  Alp.
                  Sfoote how shall I looke in this Diuels suite, sure I shall grow sick to see my shape.
               
               
                  Lo.
                  Well extremity must then be your physick, but come, you shall attire your selfe in my chamber.
               
               Exit Alp. Co. and Colo.
               
                  
                  Me.
                  Are these the winding turnes of female shames,
                  Loose womans gamboles, and the tricks of sinne?
                  And are we borne to beare these suffrages?
                  O hee thats tide vnto a brothell bed,
                  Feeles his worst hell on earth, and may presume
                  There is no sicknes like his pestilence:
                  Well, what the issue of this iest will proue,
                  My wit but yet conceiues and after time
                  Shall perfit it and giue it liberty,
                  In such sort, that if it true fire strike,
                  A world of Apes shall study for the like.
               
               Ex.
               Enter the Duke of Epire alone.
               
                  Epy.
                  My thoughts are troubled, Ioy forsakes me quite,
                  And all my meditations are reuenge:
                  Ambition and fell murder ioyne in me,
                  And aid each other to vntwine a state,
                  And make whole millions proue vnfortunate.
                  Now must I practise court art flattery,
                  And wisely temporise with blackest deedes:
                  Ile smile and stab now weepe, then laugh, then frowne,
                  And with sly tricks of state kill all suspition.
                  Diuels must seeme like Angels, saith ambition,
                  The blackest thoughts Ile study to excell,
                  Crownes and reuenge haue made men diue to hell.
                  My plot is currant and it cannot misse,
                  Whilst wisedome windes me on the clew of blisse.
                  The King shall kill the Queene, that acted right,
                  I soone will turne his brightest day to night.
                  Hees simple, honest, and loues downy rest,
                  Then he must fall, tis policie in state
                  To hurle them downe are blest with happy fate.
                  Thus each shall scourge himselfe with his owne rod,
                  Who is all policie, auowes no God.
                  Who is within there hoe?
               
               Enter Florio.
               
                  Flo.
                  Did your grace call?
               
               
                  Epy.
                  I did, where is the King?

                  Go straight and tell him I must speake with him,
                  And say my businesse doth import great haste.

                  Let slaunder rule thy tongue, enuy thy hart,
                  And let destruction be thy period
                  Of what thou speakst; for this my maxim is,
                  But rule no heauen, and but reuenge no blisse.
               
               Enter Cypres, Florio and attendants.
               
                  Cy.
                  Here comes the King, my Lord we must be priuat,
                  Remoue your hearings from our conference,
                  Now speake my Lord, speake freely as to heauen.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  First with my knee I kisse this prostrate earth,
                  And humbly beg, that which my tongue shall speake,
                  So it proceede from loue and vassallage,
                  May beare a pardon or forgetfulnes.
               
               
                  Cy.
                  You haue it, arise, discharge an open breast.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  O my dread Liege, my speech will make you sad,
                  (And Kings doe seldome rellish their distastes)
                  And from that sadnes such a storme will rise
                  As will euen droune vp all credulity.
                  O that my loyall hart could couer sinne,
                  Or that my tongue inured vnto griefe,
                  Might lose his spleene ere it distemper you,
                  But loue and mine alleagance bid me speake.
               
               
                  Cy.
                  Then speake, and doe not rack me with delay.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Women, why were you made for mans affliction,
                  The first that euer made vs taste of griefe,
                  And last of whom in torments we complaine,
                  You diuels shapt like Angels, through whose deedes,
                  Our forked shames are made most visible,
                  No soule of sense would wrong bright Maiesty,
                  Nor staine their bloud with such impurity.
               
               
                  Cy.
                  Nay good Lord leaue this Allegorick speech,
                  
                  And giue me knowledge from a plainer phrase.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Then plainly thus, your bed is prest with lust.
                  I know you doe not credit, nay whats more,
                  I know you hate me for my vertuousnes,
                  Your Queene behaues her like a curtezan,
                  I know you hold me for a vild imposter,
                  O foolish zeale that makes me be so fond
                  To leaue my faith vnto black censuring,
                  O she hath sinn'd and done a double wrong
                  To you, to her and sacred chastity.
               
               
                  Cy.
                  Duke thou art valiant, and with a valiant mind,
                  Slander is worse then theft or sacrilidge,
                  Nay more then murder, or the height of treason,
                  A step beyond the vtmost plagues in hell.
                  Then thou which in that nature wrongst a Queene,
                  Deseru'st a scourge beyond their punishments,
                  Vertue should kill thee now.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Nay doe, my brest is bare vnto thy steele,
                  Kill me because I loue thee and speake true,
                  Is this the merit of a Romane faith,
                  For this haue I obseru'd, pried in vnto,
                  And searcht each secret shift of vanity?
                  Nay pray you kill me, faith Ile patient stand,
                  Liue still a monster, hold shame in your hand.

                  Speake a word more, a King shalbe thy death.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Death is a slaue to him that is resolud,
                  And my soule loathes this seruile flattery:
                  Nor will I couer such intemperate sinne,
                  But to the world make them and that transparent,
                  Vnlesse your selfe will seeke to right your selfe.
               
               
                  Cy.
                  Thou hast awakt me, and thy piercing words
                  Haue split my sense in sunder: yet what ground ha?
                  Remaines wheron to ground suspition? a cuckold, cuckold
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Your absence is the baud to her desires,
                  For their maskes, dauncings, gaming, banquetting,
                  Strange priuate meetings and all to

                     fes in loue.
                  
                  As wanton speeches to stirre Appetite,
                  And all inchantments that inflame desire.
                  When you returne, then all is husht and still,
                  And she demurely walkes like vertues Ghost:
                  Before your face shees like a Puritane,
                  Behind your back a blushes curtezan.

                  O I haue drunck in poison at mine eares,
                  which makes my bloud boile with vnquēched flames,
                  But speake who is it that dishonors me?

                  Nay if thou cease to speake, thou hatst my life,
                  Tak'st thou delight to kill me, then forbeare,

                  Nay be but patient, smooth your brow a little,
                  And you shall take them as they clip each other.
                  Euen in their height of sin then dam them both,
                  And let them stinck before they aske God pardon,

                  To be a cuckold doth exceede all griefe.

                  Lust is the broadest path which leades to hell.

                  Hee's gone with blacke suspition in his heart:
                  And made his soule a slaue to iealousie,
                  My plots shall driue him to his owne destruction;
                  And I gaine both reuenge and dignitie.
                  He shall no sooner put his Queene to death,
                  But ile proclaime her spotlesse innocence.
                  All men will hate him for so vile an act,
                  And mad with rage depose him from his crowne.
                  Then I will be his death, his state doth giue,
                  Kings once deposd, long after must not liue;
                  For like a Phoenix rare in iealousie,,
                  He shall consume himselfe in scortching flames,
                  Whilest from his ashes I a Phoenix spring:
                  Many renounce their God to be a king,
                  And ile be one to kill men with a frowne.
                  None dare dispute the actions of a crowne.
               
               Exit.

               Enter Florio and Meshant.
               
                  Florio.
                  THe Queene is all for reuelles, her light heart,
                  Vnladen from the heauinesse of state,
                  Bestowes it selfe vpon delightfulnesse.
               
               
                  Me.
                  She followes her creation and her sexe.
                  In my conceit it is as vile a thing,
                  To see the worthy modell of a woman,
                  Who had not beene at all; but to giue life,
                  And stirring spleene to mans allacrity,
                  To sit orewhelmd with thought, with darke amuze
                  And the sad sullennesse of a grieued dislike;
                  As to behold an old man in his furres,
                  
                  Whose well spent youth, hath giuen his age full strength
                  To be his countries best physitian,
                  To caper to his graue, and with vaine gaudes
                  Trick vp his coffin, and vpon his tombe,
                  To leaue no knowledge but his leuitie.
               
               
                  Flo.
                  Tis true indeed, and nature in her selfe,
                  Doth giue vs still distaste in contraries.
                  And in my thoughts it is as base to see a woman man
                  As see a man a long roab'd feminine.

                  Obliuion hide his age, hate kill his youth.

                  Now doth her moistning palme glow in his hand

                  Women can blind our sense when we se best,

                  Deuise some new delights to shorten time,
                  This dulnesse hath no relish in my sense,
                  It hath no pith, and sloth in my conceit
                  Is but a tipe of pride in best constructions.

                  A woman faire is like a full blowne rose,

                  Nay good Lord leaue a little,
                  She that is faire is wise, and ought to know it,
                  For to that end did nature first bestow it.
                  Now of this knowledge if we be not proud,
                  We wrong the author, and we are allowd
                  To ranke with sensles beasts, sith carelesse wee
                  For want of pride detract our dignitie.
                  Now knowing it, we know truth in the same,
                  Not to be proud of truth askes follies name.
                  This lesson still is read in beauties schoole,
                  She that is faire and humble is a foole:
                  For neither knowe she how to hold her good,
                  
                  Or to keep safe the treasure of her bloud.

                  Pride giues a luster to a womans faire,
                  Things that are highest prizd, are euer deere.
                  VVhy is the Diamond the Saphyrs king,
                  But for esteeme and rarenesse? both which spring
                  From the stones pride, which is so chast and hard,
                  Nothing can pierce it, it selfe is it selfes guard,
                  Now what is pride? selfe loue, our owne esteeme,
                  A strength to make vs of our selues well deeme:
                  From whence this maxim I collect mongst other,
                  VVho hates her selfe can neuer loue another.
                  And to conclude, mans appetite growes dull
                  To what it may haue, emptie hope is full,
                  To all our sexe on earth, maid, widow, wife and bride,
                  They happy liue, when they liue with chast pride.

                  Against her tyrant husband, thats my claime

                  The king is Gods annointed, my head fits the blocke,

                  Wee haue no cause to grieue at, as for enuies toile,
                  Let her euen break her owne gall with desire,
                  Our innocence is our preuention.
                  Be cheerefull Madam, tis but some villains sound,
                  Made onely to amaze, not to confound.
                  And what must wee doe my Lord?
               
               
                  Flo.
                  To prison are the words of my commission.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  Then leade the way; he hath of griefe no sense,
                  Whose conscience doth not know of his offence.

               Scene. 1. Musique.
               Enter at one dore Epyre, at another Mariana.
               
                  Epyre.
                  HOw now mad sister, your deare loue is condemn'd,
                  A sweete adulterer.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  How, condemd before their tryall?
               
               
                  Epy.
                  No they were condemnd by Act of Parliament.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  I doe not hold thee brother for a man,
                  For it is reasonlesse to mock calamity,
                  If he die innocent, thrice happy soule;
                  If guilty, weepe, that man should so transgresse:
                  Nature of reason thus much doth importune,
                  Man should partake in griefe with mans misfortune.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  For him, if ere mine eies weep, may they drop out
                  And leaue my body blinder then my sense:
                  Pittie my foe the ruine of my house,
                  My valours scandall, and mine honours poison!
                  No let him fall, for bloud must still quench lust,
                  Law hath condemd him, then his death is iust.
               
               
                  
                  Ma.
                  Spit out that monster enuy, it corrupts you,
                  And mildly heare me answere for my loue,
                  What did he gainst you was not honourable,
                  Which you gainst him would not haue gladly done?
                  Will you hate him for acting your owne thoughts?
                  Can it be ill in him yet good in you?
                  Let reason waigh this difference then youle find
                  His honor poizes downe his infamy.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Canst thou loue him that brought thee to thy death?
               
               
                  Ma.
                  No like a God he made me with his breath.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Did he not win thy loue and then reiect thee?
               
               
                  Ma.
                  His honor not his loue doth now neglect me.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Fond maid thy foolish dotage doth mistake him.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  Hell shall haue mercie ere I will forsake him.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Farewell then sister, friend to my greatest foe,
                  Reuenge strikes home, being ended with one blow.
               
               Exit Epy.
               
                  Ma.
                  Preuention thou best midwife to misfortune,
                  Vnfold this vgly monsters treachery,
                  And let his birth be ominous strooke dead,

                  Inuention (hart of wit) possesse my braine,
                  For treason is to treason her owne bane.
                  And you bright heauens, now aid me in my plots,
                  That truth may shine through falshoods leporous spots.
                  My life Ile hazard to redeeme my loue,
                  Firme constancy like rocks can neuer moue.
                  Be bold then maiden hart in his defence
                  He saued thy life, thy life's his recompence.
                  My wit and hopes haue furnisht me with all
                  The helpes of art, to bring forth treasons fall.
                  Now to the meanes: some say that gold hath power,
                  To enter without force a gatelesse tower;
                  And Ile try that, which if it take fast hold,
                  
                  Ile neuer blame them more that doate on gold.
                  Hoe, whose within there?
               
               Enter Gailer.
               
                  Ga.
                  Who calles, what would you haue? I thought you were a womā you were so hasty: O Madam is it you? I cry you mercie.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  My griefe speakes loud sir, and my swift desire
                  Ore rules my tongue, makes it keepe time with thought,
                  I long to see a prisoner in this ill built house.
               
               
                  Ga.
                  What prisoner Madam?
               
               
                  Ma.
                  The worthy Prince, the famous Philocles.
                  
               
               
                  Ga.
                  Madame I dare not, without especiall warrant.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  I haue my brothers strong commission, hold there is gold.
               
               
                  Ga.
                  This golden calfe is an excellent Idoll; and sewe of my profession but serues it this dumb god giues tongue to all men, wit to all mē, honour to any man, but honesty to no man; and therefore as for honesty I meane not to deale with so deare a commodity, but leaue it to my better: Madam those staires direct you to his lodging.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  I thanke you sir.
               
               Exit Mariana.
               
                  Ga.
                  This is a worthy Lady to giue thus much for the bare sight of a man in affliction, if he were at liberty it were nothing: but being as it is, it is most bountifull, but it may be it is for the past houres of former recreations, well let it be what it shall be, I am sure it was not that I should hold this disputation: but see here she comes againe.
               
               Enter Philocles in Marianaes attire, and Mariana in his.
               
                  Phi.
                  Madame my soule cannot consent to leaue
                  Your life in this great hazard, nor can death
                  Carie such vgly shape as doth the thought
                  That you are left in this extremity:
                  Indeede I will not leaue you.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  Will you grow mad? what shall your nobler spirit
                  Which is the schoole of wisdome grow so fond,
                  As to reuolt from all our happines?
                  Our plots you know, and how to manage cares,
                  Whose true euents haue true proportions.
                  
                  Then deare Lord rest resolu'd, the Gailer ouer heares:
                  Liue you with safetie, most worthy maid farewell.

                  Farewell faire Prince; thanks M Iayler and a kind commend.
               
               
                  Gai.
                  As much vnto your Ladiship. So now Ile lock my dores.
               
               Exit Mar. Phi. and Gatler.
               Enter Cypres, Meshant, Florio and attendants.
               
                  Cy.
                  Is our commission, as wee gaue in charge,
                  Deliuered ore to the Corigidors?
               
               
                  Me.
                  It is, and with such strictnes and aduice,
                  For speedy execution of the same,
                  That by this time I know they are in the way
                  Vnto their execution, for the hower
                  Of death doth runne vpon his latest minutes.
               
               
                  Cy.
                  Tis well: for till their shamelesse liues haue end,
                  There can no comfort creepe into my thoughts,
                  Or ought saue mifchief keepe me company.
                  Why was I borne to this malignity
                  And lownesse of base fortune: yet my place
                  Aboue the leuell of the vulgars sight,
                  O it is but to let me know thus much,
                  That those which ly within the richest graues
                  Were at the best but fortunes glorious slaues.
                  But see, here comes my shame.
               
               Enter Corigidors, Queene and Philocles bound, and a guard of halberts with the executioner.
               
                  Que.
                  My dearest Lord.
               
               
                  Cy.
                  Passe and respect me not lasciuious woman,
                  Thy teares are of the speares of Crocodils,
                  See how I stop mine eares against thy plaints,
                  And glue mine vnderstandings from thy charmes,
                  Nay call on him thou hast offended most,
                  Mercy from me were worse then cruelty.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  My dearest dreade, my best best soueraigne,
                  
                  Whom I haue nere offended but with zeale
                  And constant loue, loyall and honorable,
                  Vouchsafe me though a Queene a subiects right,
                  And let me know for what offence I perish.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  For thine adulterat and monstrous lust,
                  Shamefull and grosse and most vnsufferable.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  Who doth accuse vs?
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  Our selfe, and our owne soule that haue beheld
                  Your vile and most lasciuious passages.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  O that my tongue would not betray my knowledge
                  Then would I amaze them all with mine assertions:
                  Madame, challenge the law.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  My gratious Lord, since no desert in me,
                  Can merit your beliefe, nor that your eie,
                  Can rightly iudge my pure complexion:
                  Yet as your handmaid, let me beg the right,
                  Due vnto wretches from our countries lawes.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  The tenure of the law you do demand.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  That in the case of slander, where the proofe
                  Proceedes as much from enuy as from truth,
                  We are allow'd our champions to defend
                  Our innocence, with a well ordered sword.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  I lookt for this obiection and allow it,
                  Nor am I vnprouided for your best
                  And strongest hope in any victory; Lords attend in my Champion.
               
               Here the noble men go forth, and bring in the Duke of Epire like a combatant.
               
                  Qu.
                  Will you my Lord approue the Kings assertion.
               
               
                  Epy.
                  Madame, although against the nature of my spirit,
                  And my first duty, bound to your allegeance,
                  Yet now compeld by duty and by truth,
                  I must of force become your opposite.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  Thou art no true Italian, nor true gentleman,
                  Thus to confound the glory of thy iudgement.
                  
                  Hath not that arme which now is arm'd against me
                  That valour, spirit, iudgement and that worth,
                  Which onely makes you worthy, stood t'approue
                  More then my selfe will challenge to my vertues?
                  And are you now basely turnd retrograde?
                  Well, I perceiue ther's nought in you but spleene,
                  And times obseruance, still to hold the best:
                  Still I demand the Law.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  And you shall haue it in the amplest manner. Sound cornets.
               
               Heere the cornets sound thrice, and at the third sound, enters Philocles disguised like a combatant.
               
                  Flo.
                  There is a cōbatant on the defēdāts part; your maiesties pleasure.
               
               
                  Cyp.
                  Giue him his oath according to the lawes.
               
               
                  Flo.
                  Are the faire ends of this your warlike posture,
                  To proue the innocence of these two condemnd?

                  This coniuration (beleeue it my Lord) shall make me leap out of all fetters, and briefly thus I haue long time loued the faire wife of the Orator; & hauing no opportunity but his absence at the senate, I tooke that season: hee out of negligence, omitting his papers returnd vnseasonably, found mee insufficiently, and forst mee to take sanctuary strangely, which howeuer I purchast, yet hee found mine

apparrell, and mistaken in the tenure, reacht it presently, put it on immediatly: and now in the senat house is pleading in it seriously.

                  Of all which my Lord, I being (in a strict conceit) a baudy witnesse: and hauing both from the Orators scornes and delaies receiued many indignities; though by this discouery to cry quittance with my proud enemy.

                  Why looke you my Lords, this Orator is not like others of his ranke,
                  Who from their ganish and fantasticke humours,
                  Go thorow the streets, spotted in peacocks plumes.
                  Wearing all colours, laces, broderies,

                  That when their gownes are off, you cannot finde
                  In Italy a master shapt more nice.
