            TO MY DEARE COVNTRY, AND ESPECIALLY TO THE dearest part of it, my Country-men of Heauen.
            
            Brethren, by the Flesh or the Spirit▪ or both;
            
               
                  WHEN I sawe the Miseries of these Times, by a successine continuance ouer-taking each other, and the Arrowes of the Almightie to fall thick vpon vs, it

seemed to mee that Wrath was gone out against vs, and that the Hand of God was vpon vs. On the other side, when I saw the dulnesse and deadnesse of Men, who hauing the stripes freshly smarting and bleeding on their backs, and the sp
                  •…
               s galling in their sides, yet are like the Horse and Mule that haue no vnderstanding, the dulnesse of the people seemed to me more fearful then the punishments. For when a Nation growes stupid and senselesse at the Chastisements of God, and doth not or will not vnderstand Gods meaning in them, there goes out a speech from the Highest, Why should they be smitten any more? whereof

this is the meaning; In stead of a fatherly Correction, there must come a sweeping Desolation. Therefore I thought it necessarie to become an Interpreter to the people, though the meanest of a thousand, to shew Gods meaning in his chastisements; for by them God would haue something to be done, the doing whereof may cure and remoue them. It may bee that some will require a propheticall Spirit, rightly to interprete the Iudgement of God, as the rich Man would haue one to come from the Dead to conuert his Brethren; but to these I giue the same answer that was giuen to him; That the Scriptures 
                  〈◊〉
                left vnto

vs for sufficient Interpreters. As Gods chastisements haue beene interpreted in them, so may we still interprete them. By this paterne haue the Fathers and Ancients of the Church made construction of Gods Iudgements, and by great Reason. For God is still one and the same both in Iustice and Mercy, and therefore he hath left one and the same Word, whereby to construe his Iudgements and Mercies. Accordingly from Gods Word in the old Testament,1. Cor. 10. 11 Saint Paul tells vs in the New, That Gods punishments on the Israelites in the first Times of the World, are to be examples to vs on whom the ends of

the World are come. Therefore let vs boldly, because safely, march vnder the Shield of so great an Example, beleeuing with him that now, as heretofore punishments and sinnes are tyed together. Indeed, if God would haue altered his course, and by a new kind of gouernment send generall punishments where there are not generall sinnes, there might haue beene need of new Prophets, to haue broght vs Newes of a new Dispensation. But before wee begin this warrantable Interpretation, let vs turne our Eyes to things most dangerously vnwarrantable, the Abuse and misconstruction of Iudgements

commonly vsed. Some take no notice at all of the strokes of this Wrath, but with the Mirth and Madnesse of Wine and Pleasures, take away the knowledge of it, as the Sacrificers in the Valley of Hinnon, by the n
                  •…
               yse of Instruments tooke away the cryes of their sacrificed Children. Such merry men, singing and dancing to the Violl, and withall forgetting the miseries of Ioseph, no doubt, will cry out with Iudas. Wherefore serueth this waste? and with Dauids brother, out of the pride of thine heart ar

                thou come▪ downe to the battell. But I answere with Dauid, Is there not a Cause; yea, euen

the greater Cause, because the Lion hath roared; and such beasts are not afraid; so that the greater the number is of these mad men of mirth, the greater had neede to be the company of Mourners, or the mourning of that Company. It is the mourning of the penitent, that maintaynes the mirth of the Delinquent, and it is the ten righteous Men that keepe fire and brimstone from a company of abominable Sodomites.
            Others there are that gaze on the stroke, and stand amazed at their miserie, but looke not vp to the highest Striker; yea, by murmuring and re

                  〈◊〉
                to bite the

stones that are throwne at them. A third sort there is, that with earthly Balmes will cure the strokes of Heauen, and by the strength of their plots will binde the hands of Omnipotence, and by the finenesse of their little Wits, will supplant the Counsells of an infinite Wisedome. All these are out of the way, and either seeke no Remedies, or false Remedies, or Remedies out of order.
            Therefore with Elihu, when I saw there was no answere in the mouth of these men, I thought to answere my part and to shew mine opinion. For my Heart was full and the Spirit within constrayned mee. A strong

desire possessed me that God might be pleased and appeased, that my Country-men, euen after the Flesh, might be both temporally and eternally saued, and out of this zeale the fire burst out, and these following wordes haue issued.
            If any finde yet another fault, that the worke is great, and this worke is little, I answere; That a little Boat may land men on a large Continent, and the Discourse that of it selfe is little, may deliuer them into a large Countrey, where by their owne View they may make a large Discouery.

Therefore complaine not that it is little, when thou mayest make it greater thy selfe, and indeed this greatnesse is most to be desired. For then shall it somewhat resemble the Sermon of Ionah, which was little in words, but great in operation; for it turned and saued a populous Citie. But this greatnesse, comes chiefly from the Greatest, to him therefore, let vs pray, Turne vs, O Lord, and wee shall bee turned.

            The Cure of our Miseries is the work in hand; and this work is aduanced by fiue Considerations, whereof,
            
               The first Consideration shewes, That God is offended, when we are punished, and this appeares euen by the weight of the punishments. Sect. 1. pag. 5.

               The second Consideration, that Gods wrath punishing, is prouoked by our great sinning. Sec. 1. pag. 41. Our sinnes are great, for wee may discouer these,

                  A third Consideration; That Gods punishments for sinne, call for Conuersion from sinne. pag. 202.
               
               A fourth Consideration; That Man turning from sinne, Gods wrath returnes from punishing Sect. 1. p. 202. which being first enlarged, & after summed, doth amount to the Medicine of Repentance. Sect. 2. pag. 214. which must haue

                     In it

                           First, A Confession of sinnes. Sect. 3. pag. 219.
                           
                           Secondly, A Detestation of sinne. Sect. 4. pag. 224. From whence issues an Anger and Reuenge on our selues for sinning, and here is set downe the true Doctrine of chastising the Body; by Fasting, &c. Sect. 5. pag. 236. And is farther cleered from the Leauen of Popish satisfaction. Sect. 6. pag. 250.
                           
                           Thirdly, A turning from sinne vnto the contrarie Righteousnesse. Sect. 7. pag. 260. And this is to be aduanced.

                                 Secondly, in others, Sect. 9. pag. 276.

                  A fifth Consideration, Necessarie, if not made vnnecessarie, by the former Considerations; It is this. Where lesser punishments preuaile not to amendment, the greater vsually preuaile to destruction. pag. 306.
                  
                  But I pray God to worke better things in vs, euen such a Repentance as accompanyeth Saluation. Amen.
                  
               
            
            Place this after the Epistle before fol. 1.
         
      
      
         
            
            OILE OF Scorpions.
            
            
               The Miseries of these Times turned into Medicines and Curing themselues.
               
            
            
               THE LORD hath Roared from SION, and sent forth his voice from the Mountayne of his Holinesse. Hee hath bent his Bow and prepared his Arrowes, yea, some of them hath hee shot, and their

wounds are yet greene vpon vs. What remaynes but to seeke remedie for the hurts receiued, & to search out means that the remayning Arrowes may bee retayned. Towards this, euen the Arrows themselues will excellently direct vs. For they are like the Arrowes of Ionathan, that had a message in their wings; for they can tel vs of wrath, and warne vs to auoid it. This language of theirs Dauid doth well vnderstand, euen men after Gods heart, but Children in vnderstanding cannot, or will not perceiue it. Ye

And GOD complayneth that the Death of the Righteous,Esa. 57. 1. a Fore-runner of Iudgement, passeth away without Consideration. It seemes then that God by his Iudgements calleth for Consideration, without which wee are Barbarians to them, and they are meere Torments to vs. Without Consideration, the profitable part of Gods Iudgements is lost, and the Tormenting part is onely left, whereas by it the tormenting part would bee taken away, and the profitable part would remayne with vs for euer. Let vs therefore heare and consider what the Lord speakes to

his Church in his chastisements, and with the blessed Virgin, Let vs lay vp his Words in our Hearts.
            
               The first Consideration.
               
                  SECT. I.
                  OF this profitable Consideration,God is offended before wee are punished. I desire this may be the first step or degree: Let vs consider and esteeme our Miseries as the strokes of wrath, euen of an offended Creator. That we may the better perceiue this Truth, let vs looke stedfastly vpon them, and behold the breadth and depth of these stripes, and I thinke they will shew vnto

vs the very Print and Stampe of diuine Indignation. It is almost an Impression in Nature; surely, it seldome failes in the Sons of Grace, when plagues are notable in Greatnesse, vnNature beleeues it. wontednesse, or vnsutablenesse to their Causes, they crie out, Digitus Dei, The finger of the Lord.

crie vnto the Lord, and by crying to him acknowledge that their plagues come from him to whom they crie for deliuerance.Grace acknowledgeth it. No maruell then, if Moses the friend of God vnderstood Gods punishments, to bee the effects of Gods wrath; who when the plague was begun after the Rebellion of Korah,

                      said plainly, Wrath is gone out from the Lord. And that we may know in some measure, what punishments are the strokes of that wrath, God himselfe giuesLeuit. 26. Deut. 28. the Names of some of them Now let vs looke on our Chastisements, and see if we can find the Names of

them, in those Rolls of Gods Iudgements. Yea, let vs see whether there be not in them that greatnesse or strangenesse which hath drawne an acknowledgement of Gods wrath, I say, not from Saints onely, but from Heathens and Fooles.
               
               
                  
                     SECT. II. The first Iudgement.
                  ANd here in the firstThe weight of the Iudgements shew it. place, let vs call to remembrance a Iudgement of Note, whose stroke by the weight of it, lookes like the blow of prouoked Omnipotence, whose name is found in the Catalogue of

Gods Iudgements, and whereof it hath beene said in the Word of Truth, that the wrath of God hath giuen lesse blowes with the same Rod. The punishment which I speake of, is the Pestilence, which almost deuoured our chiefest Citie, and with the sicknesse of the Head, the Body of this Land was also distempered. I doubt not, but some that haue forgotten it, will be almost angrie to haue it remembred; but it were better to haue a profitable remembrance of the same plague, then to haue a reuengefull remembrance by another. It is the forgetfulnesse of Gods old chastisements

that makes vs so soone to haue need of new ones: for if we laid the former to our Hearts, the latter perchance would not be laid afresh on our backs. Surely, it ought not to bee forgotten vntill it hath done the errand for which God sent it. This it seemes is not yet done, for then new punishments would not be sent vpon the same errand. Let vs therefore remember it, vntill we haue dispatched the businesse of it; and then may we best forget it, when it hath once beene soundly and effectually remembred. For in this case Remembrance is the best way to forgetfulnesse▪

Wee can for our pleasure reade in a Chronicle the storie of a great Mortalitie, how so many thousands died in one weeke, so many were layd in one pit, so few, or so none left to attend, and burie, the dying and the Dead. But to reade of such things for our profit, in a worke of Application is noysome and troublesome. What is this else but to make a meere Recreation of miserie, to

maintenance to many. Neither is this decay of Trade in some lesser limbes and farthest from the Heart of it, but in a principall Member, euen a Member wherein consists, almost the Life of our Liuelihood. For if a man in a Word would name the chiefe Commoditie of this Land, which it nourisheth most, and by which it is most nourished, it is the Fleece of the Flock; and a losse in such a general Good, is a generall punishment. It was reckoned amongDeut. 28. 4. Gods promised blessings, That Israel should be blessed in the flockes of his Sheepe; And it was reckoned among the curses, That

                     Israel should bee cursed in the flockes of his Sheepe. The substance of that blessing is the benefit that Israel should take by the Flocke, and the substance of the Curse was a Losse. So then if wee want the benefit of the Flocke, and haue a losse in stead of it, the substance of the Curse is vpon vs, though the manner may differ. And if we will doubt whether this Losse be a punishment of Gods wrath, Let vs but looke about vs, and see with what Miseries it punisheth vs. The Landlord feeles a losse in his Rents and Fines; the Tenant, a disabilitie in paying either; but especially the

Poore, in his whole Liuelihood. So that to the Poore, the vility of this Commoditie is both a Famine and Nakednesse. For, whereas

                     SECT. IIII. The third Iudgement.
                  FOr another Misery hath ouer-taken vs. And as a Man decayeth two wayes, either by debarring foode that should come from without, or wasting the

bloud that is alreadie within, so doe wee decay both for want of that supply which Trade might return, and by the wasting of that which is returned in an inward Consumption. Whither by the gaine of Transportation, or the practice of some that wish well to our pouertie, but sure I am by Gods permissiue displeasure, the Treasure of the Land is abated, if the voyce of the people be the voyce of Truth. And though Disproportion of Trade, and this Scarsitie be some Kin, yet hath this more kinred besides, for pouertie comes more wayes then one. By the losse of this bloud the

Commonwealth faynteth, and the limbs therof grow feeble. Hospitalitie dyeth, Almes are diminished, and Neede increasing, the supply of Neede decreaseth. Commerce deceiueth and is deceiued, and euen Honestie it selfe growes like Dishonestie, while it fayleth to performe what it promised, because another promise fayled it. No Trade prospers so steadily as the Trade that deuours trades; for the scarsitie of Money makes a plentie of Vsurers; their hunger deuouring most Money, when least is to be gotten. A strange absurditie, that Mony should bring most to the Lender,

when it brings least to the Borrower; and that the Rent of Money should bee dearest, when the Rent of Land is cheapest. By this Meanes pouertie in the Body Politick, is like pouertie in the Body Naturall. For pouertie in both breedes store of Vermine, which being bred of pouertie, doe increase that which bred them. And while Pouertie by the mediation of Vsurie increaseth Pouertie, Vsurie in the middle of these two Pouerties growes the richer by both of them. A Plague begot of a Plague, the effect of an old Want, and the Cause of a New. So while the Dragons giue

their brests to their young ones, and each thing releeueth and preserueth his Kind, Man onely is cruell to his owne Flesh, and enioyeth the Miseries of his owne Kind; he releeueth not Want, but releeues him selfe vpon it. Yet men must bee mannerly in touching this Vice, for else they will amend their fault with a worse, and in stead of a leisurable vndoing by lending, they will vndo men at once by calling in suddenly what they haue Lent. And so from the vnmercifulnesse of an ouer-cruell Lending, they fall into the vnmercifulnesse of not Lending. I wish they could finde the

middle way betweene hurting by lending, and hurting by not lending, which perchance might bee this, when such a Rent is set vpon money, as both the Borrower and Lender might be able to thriue. For this I thinke is the golden Meane of lending in Commerce; though I know there is a Lending beyond this, a worke of Almes and Mercy, which lends to the Lord in the poore, and neither lookes for lending againe in exchange, nor for any other earthly Reward. But auoyding those Rocks in our Sea of Miserie▪ which both make wrack, and yet seeme to entertayne the

wracked, I arriue at this safe and true Conclusion; That if the increase of siluer as stones, was recorded as a blessing in Solomons time, then may this Want be taken for a punishment. Yea, this is the putting of money into a broken bag which the Prophet Haggai
                     Hagg. 1. names for a punishment, inflicted by God vpon the Iewes. And if it be a blessing when Israel lends to manyDeut. 28. 11, 12. Nations and doth not borrow, then is it a Curse when Israel borrowes and dothLeu. 26. 16. not lend. This is a Consumption, which in many hath consumed the Eyes, and caused sorrow of Hart, and yet the wrath of God

is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

                  FOr to vs of late, euen the Lawes of Heauen, haue seemed to change, and the Couenant with Noah fromGen. 8. 22. his generall Course, hath had a particular exception. While the Earth remayneth, saith the Lord, Seedtime & Haruest, Cold and Heate, Summer and Winter, Day and Night shall not cease. True is that which the Lord saith, The course of these things shall neuer generally faile, neither

by their ceasing (as in the Verse before) will hee smite euery liuing thing. But in particular Cases and for the sinnes of particular Nations. The Sunne stands still vpon Gibeon, and theIosh. 10. 12. Moone in the Valley of Aialon. Thou shalt sow, butMica.

their Liues. The Sunne euen in the pride of his Ascending, hath couered his face, with blacke mourning Cloudes, as loth to looke vpon vnmourning sinners. Yea, the teares of Heauen, vnseasonably in regard of the yeere, but seasonably in regard of our sinnes, haue fallen downe to wash away the filthinesse with which we are defiled. The fall of the Leafe hath beene in Summer, and a Spring in the fall of the Leafe. The Husband-man this while stands amazed, at the strange displacing, and confounding of his husbandrie. By incessant showres the Corne brings forth in

the same place where it selfe was bred; and the same wombe where it selfe was bred, is also the wombe in which it brings forth. So that which should haue made bread for food, is turned to an vnkindly Seede; which wil neither be Bread nor Seede. Yea, we haue had a strange kind of Reaping, and that Reaping hath beene also an vnkindly Sowing. For, the Wind hath reaped much Corne, and that Reaping hath bin also a Sowing. So the Husband-man hath saued three labors of Reaping, Threshing, and Sowing, but by all this sauing he hath beene a great Loser. What shall I

say of it? Acerba res est terrae sterilitas & frugum

A bitter thing is an vnseasonable Haruest, and to see the Husband-man sighing ouer his Labours, and looking vpon them as vpon vntimely Births. Wee looked for much and it came too little, God hath blown vpon our Labours, and what is this but a punishment pronounced by the mouth of the Lord of Hosts, in his Prophet?Hag. 1. 6.

So Pouertie in the beginning of the veere, takes lesse because it hath more need; and Riches in the end of the yeer, craue more because they haue lesse need. Yea, Pouertie somtimes at the end of

the yeare payes deare, for that which at the beginning of the yere it selfe sold cheape. This is a Iudgment of God prouoked to anger;Leu. 26. 20. and yet thus the Wrath of God is not turned away, but his Hand is stretched out still.

To this Harmonie the Quier of Angels adjoynes it selfe, and sings a Dittie expressing the Musicke: Glory be to God on High, Peace on Earth, and Goodwill towards Men. When Man giues God in heauen his Glory, then God reacheth out to Man on earth Peace and Goodwill. Now the Peace and Goodwill of God though they passe our Vnderstanding, yet we vnderstand so much of them, that from them flow all the Mercies and Blessings that

wee can conceiue and vnderstand, and those also which the Heart of Man cannot conceiue, nor his Tongue expresse. For the Lord hauing in himselfe, a boundlesse fulnesse of Ioy, and pleasures for euermore, his Goodwill and Peace doth vnlocke vnto Man that Treasurie, and from thence flow forth the innumerable bounties of heauenly and earthly blessings. Hence are those manifold promises of GOD vnto Man, of God I say vnto Man, when Man is conformable vnto God. To Noah, pleasing God in holinesse, is an Arke of Saluation giuen amidst a generall destruction.

To Abraham, pleasing God in the Sacrifice of his Sonne, is a promise giuen that he should be the Father of the Sonne of God. To the Israelites

There is no quarrell between God and Man but Sinne, and this is a mayne one, for it sets Heauen and Earth each against other.

whom thou beleeuest not; or else thou beleeuest that thou shalt bee cursed for swearing, and swearest that thou mayest be cursed. But for my part, I thinke generally the Swearers beleefe in God is very bad. And surely, if he beleeue not in God by whom he sweares, let him excuse me for beleeuing him when hee sweares by that God in whom heeTwo kinds of swearing. beleeues not.

and I thinke it would be best confuted by a Law whereof there was a conception at the last Parliamentarie meeting. For before that time, I knew an order made at a meeting of recreation, that a penaltie should bee payd for euery oath, and that but a little one, and yet it wrought such effect, that they scarce swore three oathes in an afternoone, that by proportion of vsuall swearing should haue sworne threescore, if that order had not beene.

Thirdly, it is a miserable3. To things either lawfull or vnlawfull, if not knowne, and iudged to be that which they are sworne to bee. thing to giue oathes vnknowne. And an oath is vnknowne either where neither the words nor matter of the oath are knowne, or when the words are knowne, but not the matter. For these two latter kinds of oathes, a search and cure were very necessarie. And as in all other places so I wish especially they were examined in the Vniuersitie; That is the

Salt of the Land, and if the Salt haue lost his sauour, how shall the Land be salted; yea, how shall it selfe bee made sauourie? The doctrine of swearing from thence should flow most cleare and vntaynted, and with the cleerenesse of doctrine should be ioyned the puritie of example. And there I wish might bee considered, whether the first degrees haue no oathes giuen them of the Statutes which they know not, and whether it be easie to know them. I haue heard it complayned of; and it is pitie that he should first haue a torne conscience himselfe that coms to heale the broken

consciences of others. There is an excuse, that the submission to the penaltie is a performance of the Oath, but I wish it were well proued, that penalties were added to Laws to dissolue them and not to binde them, to make them safely not to bee kept, and not to make them safely kept.Vide Sayer.

Iudgement; and while they sweare, that they beleeue what they know not, God is inuoked to behold their Ignorance, and not their Beliefe. Neither doth it appeare to me a sufficient answer, That it is a Truth which is sworne, for it sufficeth not to the Swearer that it be a Truth which he sweares, except it be known to him for a Truth. In ciuill Causes I haue heard it taxt in a Swearer, when he hath sworne that such a Man at such a time was at such a place, when himselfe at that time was not at the place, but heard that, which he swore, reported by others. And this meetes with an other

Obiection, That elder Iudgements may bee a ground to the younger. But how is it safe to lay the safetie of a mans conscience vpon another mans iudgement, since it is certayne that man is subiect to errour, and for ought the ignorant Swearer knowes, that may bee the errour, which he sweares to bee a Truth. Is not this to beleeue as the Church beleeues, and to sweare a beliefe in Men, and not the knowledge of a Truth. How pertinent is his Majesties aduice in this Cause? Yee B

                  ANother lothsome Sin of this Land, that calleth for wrath, is beastly Drunkennesse; yea, it is a wrong to beasts to call it their sinne, for generally they are sober. And if the Swine be drunke, who is the Drunkards embleme, it is by Mans acquaintance, for I neuer heard of a wilde Boare that was drunke.Filthy in the people Wherefore it should haue a name inferiour to Beasts, as indeed it makes Men, at least for the time of it; for a Man hauing lost the vse of his Soule, is worse then

as the Eclipse of a Sunne or a Moone. This sinne in the great doth double harme, for by putting out their light, there is lost both the Light of Direction and the Light of Example. If to entertayne a great Man, a Roome should bee drest as this sinne doth dresse it; I think he would lothe both his Host and his Lodging. How much more abominable is it to doe filthinesse then to see it; yea, to doe that Filthinesse which hee cannot abide to fee? I may bee the more earnest with the greater, because this sin is like to part from the Lesser, and hath most possibilitie to remayne with the

Greater. For God hath met it with most kindly Iudgements,Shot at by the Arrowes of the Almightie. euen with Iudgements most proper to pierce the heart of it. For Pouertie & Scarsitie are the great Enimies of Drunkennesse; the Drinke by dearnesse calls for more Money; and the Money that should bee more, growes Lesser; so, the Drinke departs farther from the Money, and the Money farther from the Drinke. Then how shall a poore Drunkard continue his Trade, since it is the equall meeting of Drinke and Money that giues him his drunkennesse, and how shall they meete that are still going farther asunder?

of that Scarsitie that brings forth Sobrietie, that a sober Scarsitie is better then a drunken Plenty. Yet were it best of al if we could both begg and obtayne (and by begging we may obtayne) the grace of Sobriety. Then should wee practise Vertue out of a loue of Vertue, and should not neede a constraint by Scarsitie. Then God would bee pleased while our Sobrietie is voluntarie, and we should be blessed while a needlesse Scarsitie would be turned into Plentie. But if we will needes continue our sinnes, let vs look for continuance of wrath, it being farre better that a Man should bee

miserable then drunken, and most iust that he that is drunke should be miserable. A man of God (saith Huntingdon) fore-told greatHuntingdon. lib. 6. punishments to this Land for great sinnes, and one of them was Drunkennesse.

them there is one as fearefull and dangerous as the rest, and that is Vnthankfulnesse. But there are so many sinnes between that and the Physitian, thatAlmst beyond cure there is almost no hope of comming neere it with a Cure. For before this sinne can come to be cured, the manifold abuses of Gods blessings must be remoued. For how can men bee thankefull to God for his benefits, vntill they leaue to offend God by his Benefits? Can they (though it were but in Words) giue God any praise for his blessings, when in their deeds by these blessings they dishonour him. We haue had

Therfore first I wish they might be brought to leaue the abuse of Gods blessings, and then would there be some hope that they would giue God thankes for them; if once by a right indgement they saw them to come from God, and returned them to the honour of him that gaue them, then would they giue him thanks both for the blessings and the blessed vse of them. And then indeed doe they onely become blessings vnto vs when wee blessedly vse

them: In the meane timeA Cure is yet expected in the godly. I expect onely of the righteous that they be thankfull, for it becommeth well saith Dauid the righteous to bee thankfull. These by their thankfulnesse retaine the blessings for which they are thankfull, for thankfulnesse being bred of Gods blessings preserueth that which bred it. On the other side vnthankfulnesse looseth the blessings, which thankfulnesse might haue preserued, for it is not fit man should receiue blessings from God when God from Man for such blessings hath no returne of glory. It is a small thing to returne thanks for

reall and great blessings, which if we doe we are infinite gayners. Yea, the more we thanke God, the more cause shall wee haue to thanke him. For thanks for old benefits drawes an increase of the benefits for which we gaue thankes, as else-where more at Art of Hap. part. 3. cap. 6. large I haue shewed.

For honestie though it gaine but a little at once, yet it gaines that little often and long; for it keepes the Customers which it hath gotten.

                  THere is another sinne which I would willingly passe by, but that the wrath of God doth not vse to passe by it. In regard of the filth of it, a man can hardly speake of it, and in regard of the wrath of it, a man may not hold his peace. This wrestling of thoughts Epiphanius expresseth, when hee writes against the Gnosticks. He is pained in speaking, and pained in not speaking; if hee speake he feares to discouer

the face of a Basiliske, which may rather bring death then amendment. If hee speakes not he feares the Curse, Cursed is hee that knowes a murther and doth not reueale it. And it may bee (sayes he) someSo filthy that it makes the words that r

                  A sixth Sinne. SECT. VII. Declination to profanenesse.
                  THere is yet another Sin that calleth for Iudgements, and it is a declination from Religion to profanenesse. The ordinarie meanes which Christ hath left to maintayne the life of Religion is the Word and sacraments by the dispensation of his Ministers. Now this Word and Sacraments, and the Ministers that dispense them, for the due performance

of this work must haue a fit maintenance, a fit time, and a fit place. IfBy want of maintenance to the Mi nisterie. any of these be wholy wanting Religion falls to the ground, and as much as they are impaired, so much Religion is diminished. For the maintenance of the Ministrie, Tithes are allowed; for the place, the Church; and for the time, the Lords day. Therefore, the abatement of tithes, the ruinousnesse or the neglect of the House of God, and the profaning of the Lords day must needs be corrosiues to Religion. Yet the first hath long since beene done by Popish superstition, neither hath it yet beene healed by

a due Reformation. I haue spoken elsewhere, and nowMedit. 79. 3. part. heartily pray, That in such places where teaching wants for want of maintenance, that there might bee a supplie of it, by a supplie of maintenance, which it seemes to mee doth not exceed the wit of man to deuise. And till that time that it would please Authoritie either to allow them some helpe from the adioyning Ministers, or permit them to buy bread for themselues, or by some other meanes prouide for that want; since howsoeuer fulnesse of bread be suspected of nicenesse and wantonnesse, yet it is pitie that

want of bread should therefore lacke that compassion which belongs to it. AsBy the neglect of repairing Gods House, or repayring to it. for the place allotted to the Ministerie, it hath of late receiued decent Reformation, but I wish the houses be not emptier as they grow fairer. For Mans corrupt Nature is apt to make ill vse of Libertie and Impunitie, and as there is a Recusancy of a deceiued Conscience, so there is a Recusancy of a No-Conscience; and I wish the latter Recusants make no ill vse of any Libertie giuen to the former, neither that they grow bold vpon any Impunitie not intended to them. Lastly, for the Time, which is

the Lords day, to lay asideBy workes or playes of distraction and incongruitie on the Lords day. all Iewish superstition, it is most assured, That as the Church cannot ordinarily consist without the Word, nor the Word without a Place; so neither can the Word in his place be profitably communicated without an appointed Time. IfDangerous to the very Life of the Church. so; then the Time appointed for the Ministerie of the Word is a mayne preseruatiue of the Church; and on the contrarie, the peruerting of that Time is a very corrosiue and consumption to the Church: Then how wary should men be of encroching vpon that time by any vnfit or derogatorie action, since the ouerthrow

thereof hath such a fearefull effect as the ouerthrow of the Church? It is fit that men should keepe off from the borders of such a capitall Sinne, as they would keepe themselues a good wayes off from the brinke of a bottomlesse pit. And a good and tender Conscience should cast with himselfe, how he may bee sure with discretion to goe farre enough from it, rather then how hee may safely come nee

both the Time and the Place, why should wee not thinke it a profanenesse in turning the time as the place from the worke appointed to it. To turne the place of Gods seruice into a place of sporting, euen when Gods seruice is not there, is in most mens eyes a profane incongruitie and indecencie. And why is it not a like profanenesse to turne the day appointed to Gods seruice into a day of sporting, euen then when the seruice of God is not doing? Surely, to doe the dayes worke in the day seemes to bee most proper and reasonable. If so; then works, or if you will, playes

of distraction that make the proper workes of the day lesse profitable and more forgotten, how can they be iustified?

                  A seuenth Sinne. SECT. VIII. Back-sliding to Idolatrie.
                  I Might here adde as grieuous a Sinne; a backsliding to Idolatrie, but that the falling of some is ouercome by the strong constancy of many.

And surely there is no better meanes of keeping the Truth, then a heartie loue and strong affection. It is

                  A first wretched absurditie. SECT. IX. Apostasie from the spirituall worship of God vnto Idolatrie.
                  A First is that mayn and capitall point of Apostasie,

The turning vnto dumbe Idolls from the liuing God. For if Paul make1. Cor. 12. 2. 1▪ Thess. 2. that the Character of a Conuert, euen the turning from dumbe Idolls to the liuing God, then it is a notable Character of an Apostata to turne from the liuing God vnto dumbe Idolls. For in the same path wherein the Conuert walks from Idolls vnto God, in the same doth the Apostata goe backe from God vnto Idolls. And whereas there hath beene a sleight excuse for so grosse a fault, That an Idoll is the Image of nothing in the world; surely, this answere is nothing in the world. For the

Image of those things that are, may be Idols, if diuine worship bee giuen vnto them, as Aquinas teacheth,Th. Aqu. 2, 2

Yea, which is more, euen the things themselues may be turned into Idols, for so the Starres of Heauen were turned into Idols by the Israelites, and the Licaonians would haue made Idols of the Apostles themselues. The meaning therefore of the Apostle is manifestly this, That an Idoll is not at all that thing for which it is worshipped; or in regard of that Godhead which by worship is attributed to it, it is nothing in the world.

This interpretation dothIdolatrie practised most heartily by the Papists. 
                     Aquinas himselfe giue, and reason it selfe doth shew it. For though as it is a piece of Metall, or a Starre, or Man, it hath a being, yet as it is an Idoll, and by worship made a God, the Idoll of it is nothing in the world. It is a meere lye, as the Prophet sayes, euen an affirmation of that which is not, For it tels the People it is a God when it is not. And for this reason doe we detest this wickednesse of the Romanists, because by curious shapes, rich ornaments, forged miracles, and dangerous Doctrines, theyAnd taught by their Doctors. draw the people to giue diuine worship to that which

is nothing. And lest wee should doubt much whether diuine worship bee by their Doctrine ascribed to Images, wee shall find that in plaine termes they haue confessed it. Indeede the Councell of Trent hathHow the Councell of Trent is a generall Councell. herein dealt most cunningly, yet withall most cōtrarily to the intent of a Coun cell; since herein it onely deserues to be called a generall Councell, because it couers many Questions with generall Termes; and so in this Question it sayes, wee must worship Images debit a veneratione, with due worship. Surely, a Councell should haue resolued doubts, and not haue continued

them, but hereby it appeares that they would not, or could not resolue, either of which is faultie. But if their Councells will not tell vs their Doctrine, we must aske next of their Doctors, and some of them plainly shew vs that Doctrine of Idolatrie. Aquinas though he saith that Idolatrie is the giuing of diuine worship to a Creature, yetAqu. part. 3. quaest. 25. art. 2. 3. he excepteth the Image of Christ, and sayes, diuine worship belongs to that. His reason is most weake for so mightie a Doctor, but we must remember his iudgement was preiudiced by Custome and Education. Because of Christs Deitie,

saith he, Christ must be worshipped, & the Image for representing Christ. But what doth Christs Deitie to the deifying of a piece of wood? Not by Representation, for the Godhead, as Paul saith, is not like siluerAct. 17. 29. or stone. Neither by Vnion or Communication, for the Deitie hath by no meanes giuen it selfe so much vnto stone that it should be worshipped. Yea, the Deitie hath sworne cleane contrarie, that itEsa. 42. 8. will not giue his glorie to grauen Images. AnotherGregor de Valent. Apol. de Idol. citat. à Rainol. & confut. pre

is a chiefe worship due to the true God, and being giuen to an Image, it is true Idolatrie. And though for his owne part, he would fain in this point, as in others, bee somewhat neater then his fellows, yet shal we find in his Doctrine two mayne props or parts of Idolatrie: the one, where he sayes▪ That the worship giuen to the Image, is determined or bounded in the Image. And herein he doth no other, but make the Image, a very obiect of worship. And secondly, lest by making it a lower kinde of worship, and an improper Latria, he might flie out at a back-doore, which hee vsually

leaues open for that purpose: hee saith further, That an Image may properly bee worshipped with Latria, if wee ioyne the ImageCap. 23. and the Paterne in one Imagination. Then a strong or intense Imagination, may worship Images with diuine worship, which is flat Idolatry. This strong imagination is indeed one of the strong delusions, belonging to the Chayre of Pestilence, by which men are led to beleeue lyes. A noble subtiltie, and meere trick of a Iuggler, which makes things really diuided, seeme to be one; and from a seeming Vnitie, will enforce a reall Vnitie of

worship: The Image and the Paterne are asunder in themselues, and together onely in the Imagination, then how can they scape Idolatrie, that giue diuine worship, to a thing really and truly diuided from the Deitie? Surely, Bellarmines reason, if it be holpen, will onely goe so farre, That men may worship the Image which is in their Brayne, and not the Image before their Eyes. For the Image in their Brayne, hath an imaginarie Vnion with the Paterne, but the Image before their eyes hath none at all. But what is this, but to become vaine in imaginations, & while men professe

themselues to bee wise in their subtilties, to become stark Fooles, as Saint Paul speaks vpon the sameRom. 1. 21, 22. subiect. It must bee a reall Vnion, as that is betweene the Deitie and Humanitie of Christ, that must giue a reall Communitie of worship. I would fayne know of Bellarmine, if hee came into the Popes Wardrobe, and there saw the Robes of the Pope, and imagined them on the Popes body, whether hee would fall downe, and giue the same honour to the Clothes, that he would doe to the Pope himself, if the clothes were worne by him. And yet I may tell him farther, That

the clothes being worne by him, there is no reall or personall vnion betweene them, and therefore there is some difference of honor, giuen to the Man, and to the clothes which are no part of the Man.
                  Now, if these great Doctors maintayne sdolatrie, what shall the blinde Multitude doe but stumble, atGal. 5. 20. these stumbling-blocks laid before them by the Learned? The flesh inwardly is prone to Idolatrie, as the Scripture teacheth; the obiect without by beautie and conformitie is fit to tempt to Idolatrie; Ducit enim & affectu quodam infirmo, rapit infirma corda mortalium,

And to the two temptations inward and outward, is ioyned in the Middle a Doctrine to consummate the worke of Idolatrie, by ioyning a carnall Heart, to the beloued Image, in a wretched worship. I may notdenie an election of grace, which was found in Israel, when their estate was outwardly so desperate, That Elias could not see one true worshipper

besides himselfe. But I find both by Doctrine and Practice, that Church is generally and maynly giuen to Idolatrie. Agobardus, a reuerend Bishop, and neare to eight hundred yeeres Antiquitie, saith, Nullus antiquorum

But now this error by growing is made so manifest, that it is come neere to Idolatrie, or the Heresie of the Anthropomorphites, men worshipping Images, and putting their trust in them. So we see how it was in the time before him; the Fathers generally denyed

worship to Images. ButN

apparition of grieuous plagues, successiuely tormenting them for this sin in their successiue generations. And to this day the remembrance of them is so terrible, that of all other sinnes, the Iewes will by no meanes be brought to Idolatrie. And in this respect, I thinke, the Church of Rome by her Idolatrie, is a mayne obstacle to their Conuersion; and it seemes by the same reason, the taking away of that fountain of Idolatrie, would further much the conuersion of the Iewes. Certayne it is, that the Iewes shal be called, and that their Calling shall bee to a pure and primitiue

Truth, for their Calling shall be glorious, euen as aRom. 11. 15. rising from the dead? Neither shall the Gentiles begin their Calling in a primitiue purity, and the Iewes haue their vprising clouded with the Errors and impurities of the Gentiles. If it should be so, where is that priuiledge of loue for the Fathers sakes? If then the Iewes shall bee called by a Doctrine of puritie, what must become of the Romish impuritie, the Mother of superstitions and abominations? But in the meane time, let this be our griefe, that a Nation denyeth Christ which hateth Idolatrie; and a People maintayneth

Idolatrie that professeth the Name of Christ. To conclude this point, if any would feele the weight of the iealousie of God (and iealousie is the rage both of God and Man) threatned in his Commandement; if any man would fayne haue the Iudgements of God powred on him, which were heretofore on the Iewes, of which themselues are wearie: If any would be partaker of the plagues of Babilon, let them be also partakers of Babilons Idolatrie,Reu. 9. 21. euen the worship of Gold, Siluer, Wood, and Stone.
               
               
                  
                  A second dangerous Absurditie. SECT. X. Partaking of a Religion laden with bloud.
                  ANother grosse absurditie and step into Miserie, is the entring into a Religion laden with bloud, euen the bloud of the Prophets and Saints, and those which are slaine vpon earth. When a Murtherer is conuinced of some cruell blood-shed, who would infect himselfe with his guilt, and take part to himselfe of a Murtherers guilt and punishment? But in this purple Congregation, is the bloud of many

thousands; yea, the bloud ofReu. 18. 24. many Prophets & Saints, and of all that were slaine vpon earth. A most grieuous burthen, and pressing down into hell. This mountaine of bloud will make bloud-guilty men to cry for Mountaines of earth to fall vpon them, & couer them. And as vpon the last Ierusalem that slew Christ, the sin of the first Ierusalem thatMat. 23. 34 slew the Prophets; yea, euen before Ierusalem the bloud of Abel the righteous, came altogether in one reckoningYea, with the bloud of al▪ Sai

                        . of punishment; So by the like proportion vpon the latter Rome by which is shed the bloud of latter Christians, shall come the

bloud of the first Christians shed by the first Rome. Yea, I may say that from Abel the Righteous vnto the last Protestant slaine for Religion, all the bloudshed shall bee required of Rome. For first it is said, That in her shall be found the bloud of the Prophets, and all slaine vpon Earth. And secondly, why should not Rome bee as guiltie of the bloud of Abel as Ierusalem, and if of Abel, much more of the bloud of nearer succeeding Prophets. Neither is it without Reason; for the Communication of bloodinesse, is the Communication of blood, the incorporating into a

sinfull societie, partakes the Iudgements of that Societie. For as Saint Austen well obserues, There is one Citie of the Diuell which began first in Cain, and endeth in the last sinner, and they that come to be a part of that Citie shall receiue the Cursed priuiledges of that Citie; they haue a Communitie of plagues byReu. 18. 4. partaking the fellowship of that Communitie. Neither are men in danger onely of partaking their plagues, by partaking the Communitie of Association, but because by the communitie of Association vsually comes the communitie of Infection. So the

associating of a bloudie SocietieYea, tainting with an Infection of crueltie and bloudines. often infects men with a bloudie Conformitie. Romish Religion (if it shall bee called Religion) herein is most contrarie to true Religion. For whereas true Religion, turneth crueltie into meeknesse, and makes the Lyon to sleepeEsa. 11. 6. with the Lambe, this Religion hath turned Lambes into Lyons, and made men of excellent natures to become Sauage and Cruell. There are too many examples to proue this Truth, and wee need not to set sayle for the fetching of them; for euen in this landSir E. Dig. Knight. Amb. Rook. Esquire. to the foulest Treason vpon Earth, hath this Religion

peruerted the fairest dispositions. And howsoeuer the fact being by Gods mercy defeated, now it is stiled by some the deed of desperate and forlorne persons (for such facts Non laudantur nisi peracta) yet these men neither in estate nor disposition were such, but in both eminent; and I pittie much that euer it should come to passe, that sweet dispositions should bee made cruell by any thing called Religion. But as pittifull as it is, yet true it is, That a Popish proselite, being transplanted by a Iesuite, doth too often proue a stocke on which Murther and Crueltie is

grafted. Let vs therefore feare the Communion of this bloudie Citie, lest wee get a Communion of their bloudinesse, which if we doe, let vs looke for a communion of their plagues, let vs expect a part in all the vengeance belonging to innumerable Murthers. Then may wee feare that the bloud of former dayes shed in this Realme, will light vpon vs, when wee partake with the Doctrine that shed it. If the Son seeEzek. 18. 14 his Fathers sinnes, and auoyd them, they shall not bee imputed to him. But if a bloudie Father bring a bloudie Sonne, then the bloudinesse of the Father

descends on the Sonne. In Iosiahs time after Manasses bloudinesse, the destruction of Israell was stayed, and he had a promise of ending his dayes in peace, which he did, for no man fought against him, but he sought warre against himselfe. But when Zedekiah raignes that

                     Iehoiakin is full of bloud and violence,2. Chro. 36. 16. when the Prophets are misused, and there is no Remedie. Then comes the bloud of the Fathers vpon a bloudy posteritie, and Ierusalem is carried away into Captiuitie. So if wee ioyne hands with a bloudy Doctrine, then let vs looke

for a share in the whole reckoning of bloud which that Doctrine hath shed. Our sinnes are great and grieuous, but yet in this sinne, let vs giue Rome leaue to outcry vs, that the greatnesse of their cry may couer ours, and stop it from hearing. And indeed, though our sinnes bee grieuous, yet their sinnes herein haue an eminence, because theirs are sinnes of Antiquitie, and sinnes of Doctrine; Ours, though grieuous, are latter and of fleshly Corruption, not of Doctrine and Instruction. We are naught as wee are men, not as we are Protestants; Their bloudinesse and Idolatrie

hath beene theirs, as they are Papists. Let vs take heed then that we bind not sinne vnto sinne, since one sinne will not escape vnpunished. Let vs not ioyne the sinnes of Antiquitie to the sinnes of latter Ages, nor the sinnes of Doctrine to the sinnes of naturall Corruption.
               
               
                  A third Dangerous Follie. SECT. XI. To runne from God preseruing, vnto God destroying.
                  A Third dangerous Absurditie, is to forsake

the Religion wherein God hath giuen vs miraculous deliuerances, and to runne to that Religion which in the same deliuerances of vs, God hath blasted with fatall ouerthrowes. This was

What a madnesse is this to flie from strength vnto weaknesse, from safetie into danger, from Gods protection into Gods desertion, to rest on the helpe of that, to which God hath shewed himselfe an Enemie. Surely if all the Nations of the earth would

flie from God to Superstition, this Kingdome aboue all other should say with Ioshua, I and my people wil serue the Lord. For our deliuerances haue beene so eminent, that they cry aloud, The hand of God and not of Man.

Yea, it is stranger, that it should be more then able to helpe it selfe, and haue a supererogation of helpe for others. For the helpe of this Kingdome

ouerflowed to Henry the Fourth of France, and to the distressed Prouinces of the Low-Countries; yea, it maintained and ended a most consuming Warre in Ireland. And in the middest of publike oppositions, a multitude of priuate Treasons issued out of Hell, against the person of the most glorious Princesse of the world. Yet was she safe in the midst of dangers; yea safe without danger. For though their malice reached at her, yet shee was in no danger, because their chayne was so short, that she was out of their reach. God at once defended her, and limitted them; yea, she

If at any time he hurt not by nothurting, he endeuours that he may hurt the more hereafter; An Enemie seemes not to hurt, while he is gathering of men, and mustering of his forces, but euen then when hee hurts not, he is commonly in the way to do

                        . That there is a mayne

difference of goodnesse betweene our Religion and that of Rome, and of Gods dispensation to either: The Religion of Rome in the Queenes time, made her own Subiects traytors, and sent forth Assasines against her, but God wholly defeated them. Our Religion neuer suborned priuate Assasines against any King, but GOD gaue vs publikely great successe and oduantage. Wherefore let me heere note, that our Religion agrees better with the ancient Religion of the Sea of Rome, then the Religion of present Rome. For this was the Religion of Gregorie the great. If I

would haue to doe with the death of the Lombards, the Nation of the Lombards, this day had beene without a King. But because I feare God, I feare to medle with the death of any man.

It was God that deliuered vs, and he deliuered vs so, that he would be knowne to be our Deliuerer. For whenStrange, because done by contrarie meanes. God sends a deliuerie by the hands of our Enimies, the deliuerie that cannot be imputed to our Enimies, must be imputed vnto God.

Our Enimies would haue destroyed vs, God would preserue vs, and God resoluing to preserue vs, performes it by our Enimies that would destroy vs. By Traytors he sends notice of the Treason, and so defeats the Treason by the same that should effect it. And he that was wonderfull in sending the words, was wonderfull in giuing the Interpretation. And as once the words on the Wall were by God vnvsually written, and by him in Daniel strangely interpreted; so it pleased God that directed the Letter, to giue his Majestie an vnvsuall interpretation of it, so that Gods

wonderfull Prouidence by that Letter, spake to them to whom the Letter meant not to speake, and spake a meaning in the wordes, in which the Letter had no such meaning. So are there two Senders and two Indi

A strange deliuerie, both in respect of the prodigious danger from which we were deliuered; in regard of the meanes of deliuerie; and lastly, in regard of the opportunitie of it. For our deliuerie from danger was almost in the time when we should haue

Let vs be ashamed to be afraid, since our feare can but betray vs, and make vs weaker, and so more subiect to that which we feare. Wee see here was no feare, nor preuentions carnally politick, the Bastard-issues of feares; and yet while we feared not, nor by feare preuented not, we were deliuered from a destruction most fearfull. Yea, whatsoeuer plots, either feare or

policie shall hereafter vnlawfully actuate, let it still be remembred, That a deliuerie, wherein there was neither feare nor policie giues vs our being. And in that deliuerie it was the Truth to which God gaue our liues as a prey, wherefore it stands vs vpon, to preserue confidently that Truth, by which our liues haue beene preserued. To runne to Popish superstition is to runne to destruction. Let vs therefore abide rather with the Israelites then with the Egyptians, with those that were miraculously deliuered, then with those that strangely perished. I will adde for a

Corollarie some sentences of Gregorie the great, which I desire the Reader to giue to them to whom most fitly they belong.

                     Eccles 7. 25 the foolishnesse of madnesse. A man by creation is the most excellent creature. A woman by creation is inferiour to the man.

                     rthest from them, when they striue to come neerest them. Surely, it is very farre from the power of a Taylor

or a Barber to make a foolish woman resemble a wise man. What an endlesse Maze of Vanitie is this, that after the change of all fashions, Nature her selfe is growne out of fashion, and violent hands are layd on the Creation? Is it not time that the vniuersall Fire should cancell all creatures, when the chiefe of creatures cancell their owne creation? Surely, it seemeth to meeVnnaturall sinnes hasten the end of Nature it self. that these sinnes against nature, as the sinnes of Sodom, aboue all other sinnes, that runne not immediatly against the Deitie, crie aloud for brimstone, and fire, and vtter destruction. For why should they be any longer,

who themselues will no longer be that which they are? Why should the Heauen, the Sea, and the Earth keepe their courses steadily, to maintayne a Creature that runnes all out of course? A strange Patience of the Almightie, that order should continue the nourishment of disorder, and Nature should goe on to maintayne them that sinne against Nature. But let all Vnnaturalists bee fully assured, that Damnation sleepeth not though presently she strikes not; the blow is the greater, the longer it is comming; God shall take part with his Creation, and iustifie it against all that violate

it; yea, he shall condemne such, and cast them farre below beasts and vnsensible Creatures; For these haue generally kept their courses and kinds, but Man, who by his Reason should best haue kept his course, he hath most forsaken it, yea, hee hath made head against it. For the height and perfectionThe top of sinne to which aspireth mans ambitious wickednesse. of Vice is now no other but a maine opposition against Nature, and a turning of kinds out of kind, by abominable Pride and Luxurie.
                  A second kind of monstrousnesse2. Kind of Mostrousnesse; Excesse. hath beene described to be excessiuenesse of measure, or an vnmeasurable greatnesse. This great

excesse in Apparell hath beene too apparent; for it was made of purpose to be seene, and yet the more it is seene the more is our sham
                        •…
                      and vanitie seene. Hospitalitie, Charitie, yea the Patrimonie it selfe hath been cut vp into Cloathes; for an excesse both in costlinesse and varietie hath diminished House-keeping, Almes; yea, somtimes clothes hereby haue taken away the maintenance of Cloathes. Vertues by staruing themselues haue nourished Vice, and that which should haue liued is dead, that what should haue dyed may liue. Besides, this excesse of Ap parell hath remoued the

whole Land out of his place, and lifted it out of the hinges. For by the ambition of cloathes there is a generall remoue, and the Lower is stept into the place of the Higher, and each goes about to bee like them who are vnlike him. Besides, the whole shape of this Nation is changed, and cloathes are no longer interpreters of the wearers, but need themselues an interpretation. So that if a man that for sooke this land some fortie yeares since, should now returne againe; in good manners hee could not but say your Lordship to a Gentleman, and your Worship to the Sonne of a

Farmer. But (which is another mischiefe) if by an interpreter hee once bee brought to know a man, the next time he meets him hee hath need of a second interpretation, for the old man is lost in some new disguised fashion. Such a confusion hath this vice bred, That by it both men and their degrees are growne out of knowledge; for vnknowne they are both to themselues and others. Surely if euer that were true which Hunting don speakes, That the vanitie of mens mindes should expresse it selfe in the strangenesse of Apparell, these are the times wherein as wee haue committed

the sin, why should wee not expect our deserued punishment. Our Ancestors were wise in seekingWhich hath bred a diminution of necessarie duties. remedies for this Vice, and I wish it were seconded; and that it would please Authoritie to enioyne some rules of distinction, and that the ordinary sort of men might be tyed to our owne Cloathes, especially now when our owne Cloathes lacke money to buy them, and men lacke money to buy the Cloathes of other Countries. Why should such buy the stuffes of other Nations, when our owne will very well become them, the Poore shall bee kept in bread by their

worke, flockes and Pastures shall at least keepe their value, and the Land shall keepe her money? It is aThe true way to remoue Losses, is to remoue Vices. most-proper Cure when in one Act a Vice and a Losse are remoued, for the remouing of the Vice is the true way of remouing the Losse. For till God be pleased, by the remouing of Vices, it is in vaine to talke of the remouing of Losses. But if no other Remedie bee giuen, Pouertie the naturall Remedie of Pride, I thinke, at last will cure it. And that either a particular pouertie which is commonly the fruit of prodigalitie; or a generall while needlesse Commodities abroad fetch

away the money that wee need at home. In the meane time this is most certaine, That the wrath of God and the punishments of thatEsa. 3, 22, 24. wrath are denounced against this Monster of Apparell. The changeable sutes shall bee taken away, and in stead of a Girdle shal be a Rent, in stead of welset hayre shall be baldnesse. Yea, God threatneth this sinne by the Prophet Zephanie, saying; In the dayZeph. 1. 8. of the Lords sacrifice I will punish all those that are cloathed with strange Apparell. And that wee may know what kinde of day that day of the Lord is, he giues vs the sight of it.

That day is a day of wrath,Ver. 12, 13, 15. a day of trouble and distresse, a day of darknesse and gloominesse, a day of clouds and thick darknesse. And because these generall vices are vsually accompanied with a generall securitie (for if men did generally feare, they would not generally sinne.) Euen to such fearlesse men thus setled on their lees, and that say, the Lord will doe neither good nor euill to them, it is said; Euen their goods shall become a bootie, and their houses a Desolation.

                     SECT. XIIII.
                     Against mutinous speaches and seandalous libels. A Madnes of the Vulgar, who hauing drawne Miseries on them by sinnes, murmure against their Miseries, but not against their sins. A fault of the Vulgar.
                  BVt before I passe to a farther Consideration, I must needs meet with an ill custome of the Vulgar. When Miseries are vpon them, they haue commonly mutinous and tumultuous thoughts; and from thence issue their censures of gouernment, their outcry for want of Lawes, or want of keeping them. In this is a fault, and I desire they may know it. For whither their censure beetrue or false, they are in either to be blamed. If it be false, an apparant falshod is

an apparent fault, and therfore needs not to bee proued. But if it be true, they are to blame in the vn-due effects that issue from it. For besides that, Mutinie is an ill remedie of Miserie, the greatest Miserie being a bad helpe of the lesser, they are to blame in this, That they looke so farre from them, and aboue them, for the finding and amending of faults, which they should haue done most aptly at home. For if sinnes be the radicall cause of Miseries, then it is also the Cause of the Causes of Miserie. So, if faults in gouernment bee the causes of Miserie, sinne may be thought to be the

cause of those Causes. Accordingly Salomon saith,Pro. 28. 2. That for the sinnes of the Land the Princes are many, that is, because a Land is wicked, it is punished with a confused gouernement. And when God was angrie with Israel, then hee2. Sam. 23. 1 24 left Dauid to a sinne, that by the occasion of Dauids sinne, the sinnes of Israel might be punished. Herevpon Gregorie the Great inferreth,Moral. lib. 25. cap. 14. That according to the qualities of the Subjects, are disposed the acts of the Rulers, so that for the sinne of the Flock, there may be a fault in the life of a good Shepherd. If this be true, let the People amend

the faults in themselues, which they seeke to amend beyond themselues, and by quitting their owne euill, escape that euill which dependeth vpon it. If theEx quorum causa peccauit, saith Gregorie. sinnes of Israel be the cause of the sinnes of Dauid, the taking away of the sinnes of Israel, had beene the readiest way of preuenting that sinne of Dauid. Therefore, if thou wilt haue any thing amended abroad, amend it at home in thy self, for there is thy work which properly belongs to thee. But if thou looke to faults abroad, and leauest faults at home, which may be their causes; surely, wonder not if the faults abroad be not

mended, while the faults at home which caused them bee nourished. Leaue then the Gouernours to their Lord and Gouernour, who if they offend can punish them himselfe. Therefore Gregorie saith of Dauid, beMoral. in Iob lib. 25. cap. 14. cause hee of his owne will growing proud, was not without fault, therefore he also receiued the punishment of his fault; for the raging wrath that strooke the Bodies of the people, strooke the Heart of the Gouernour. But which is farre more comfortable on all sides, Let the amendment of thy heart please the heart of God. For▪ God being pleased, frames the

heart of Gouernours, that they shall bee pleasing to God, and from the abundance thereof send foorth that which shal be pleasant to the hearts of the people.

That the punishments of God for our sins, call vpon vs for a turning from our sinnes vnto God. Our mercifull God, compassionate to Mankinde, powres not out his wrath all at once, but sends lesser chastisements before, to

preuent the greater; and shootes off some warning Pieces, to make vs strike the Saile of our carnall swelling, before he begin mainly to fight against vs, by a destroying and desolating Batterie▪

Yea, God himselfe opens to vs this method of his Chastisements, when he tells the Israelites many times in one Chapter, That hauing punishedLeuit. 26. them sore for their sinnes, if they will not hearken and bee reformed thereby, hee will punish them yet seuen times more; whence it

plainly appeares, that the fruit expected of his former punishments, was a reformation of those sinnes for which they were punished. Elihu, the Spokesman ofIob. 34. 31. God vnto Iob; tells him and vs, what is meet to bee said vnto God in affliction; It is meet, saith hee, to say thus vnto God, I haue born Chastisement, I wil not offend any more. Finally, theHeb. 12. 10. Apostle telleth vs this vse of Gods chastisements; we are chastised (saith he) that wee might profit thereby, and the profit he describeth to be this, That we might be partakers of Gods holinesse. As this hath beene taught by God, so hath it

been practised by the godly,Practised by the Godly. for by Gods chastisements, they haue turned from the sinne for which they were chastised. Before I was chastised, saith Dauid, I went astray, but now doe I keepe thy Law. The very rehearsall of Iudgements vpon sinne, worketh in Iosiah a publique reformation of sinnes. And Solomons
                  Wisd. 12. 2. wisedome, which is a kind of paraphrase of Scripture, herein agreeable to the Scriptures, hath this obseruation: Thou chastnest them by litle and litle that offend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherin they haue offended; that leauing

                   and Heathens beleeued, that conuersion from sinne was Gods end in his punishments for sinne. Therefore the false-hearted Israelites,
                  Iudg. 10▪ 10 16. being oppressed by the Philistines and children of Ammon, runne vnto the Lord; saying, Wee haue sinned against thee, both because wee haue forsaken our God, and also serued Baalim; And they put away their strange gods and serued the Lord. The Niniuites,
                  And Heathen. though Gods iudgements were peremptorily pronounced against them, yet they so farre take notice

of this purpose of God; that by punishmēts threatned or imposed, God aymeth more at the destructions of sinnes, then of sinners; that not withstanding, Ionahs peremptorie affirmation, they will still retayne a hopefull dubitation. Accordingly runs the Kings Proclamation, Let them turne euery one from his euill way, and from the violence that is in their hands, Who can tell if God will turne and repent, and turne away from his fierce anger that we perish not? Thus wee see that God hath a meaning of conuersion in his punishments, and that Man in them hath heretofore

rightly vnderstood this meaning of God. God doth not meerly afflict, as Elihu truly teacheth, but by affliction doth instruct vs, his Rods doe giue vs knowledge, and open the Eares that were sealed. Gods chastisements are like Samsons Lion, which thogh at first they come terribly vpon vs, and with a shew of deuouring, yet after they yeeld vs the Hony of Instruction and Reformation if wee looke neerely into them. The Apostle puts thisHeb. 12. difference between the Father of Regeneration, and the Father of Generation; Our spirituall Father doth punish vs for our profit, the

carnall Fathers sometimes for their pleasure; God delighteth not in torments or death, no not in the death of a sinner, but in the death of his sinnes. What remayneth, but that as God intends his chastisements, and as holy Men; yea, Heathens haue truly construed them, so wee also rightly consider, receiue, and apply them. Let vs heare Gods voyce in his punishments, let vs vnderstand and obey it, and let his Correction bring foorth Conuersion. But I deferre the Exhortation vnto the Conclusion.

By Ezekiel he tellethEzek. 18. 30 vs, Repent and turne your selues from all your Transgressions, so iniquitie shall not be your ruine; yea, he giues vs there particular cases of this Doctrine. If theVers. 14. Sonne see his Fathers sins and considereth, and doth not the like, he shall not die for the iniquitie of his Father, hee shall surely liue.

and right, he shall surely liue he shall not die. Yea, all the transgressions that he hath committed shal not bee so much as mentioned to him. In Ieremie there isIere. 31. 18. a passionate conference betweene GOD and Ephraim, which is a liuely Table and Representation of Gods dispensation vnto Man, formerly expressed in these passed considerations. First, Ephraim acknowledgeth to God that his chastisements were vpon him, Thou hast chastised me, O Lord, and I was chastised. Secondly, that his sinnes were the cause of his chastisements: He confesseth that hee was like a Bullock, vnaccustomed

to the yoke. Thirdly, he shewes the operation of Gods chastisement in him; it stirred him vp to call on God for the grace of Repentance, Turne thou mee and I shall be turned: And fourthly, the tendernesse of Gods mercy to Ephraim, being penitent in most affectionate wordes; Ephraim my deare Sonne and a pleasant Child, since I spake to him I doe earnestly still remember him: Therefore, my Bowels are troubled for him, I will surely haue mercy on him. This one president, if there were no more, doth sufficiently giue a perfect plat-forme of the Cure of our Miseries, either

to the Teacher or the Practiser. The wrath and punishments which sinne hath twisted together, Penitence vntwineth and dissolueth. Sinne calleth for punishments, Punishments call for conuersion from sinne, and conuersion from sin expelleth punishments. Infinite it were to accumulateAnd by the performance of those promises. Gods Promises of mercy to repentance, or examples of such Promises performed. Back-sliding Israel vnder the Iudges often fell backe to their sinnes, yet often returning from their sinnes, were deliuered from their miseries. Yea, euen Ahab by the out-side of repentance, which he wore

on his body, in his garment of sack-cloth and gesture of going softly, deferred the rooting out of his Familie for the terme of his life. When Manasseth had laden himselfe, and Iudah with the roaring sinnes of bloud and Idolatrie, yet Manasseth by repentance is vnladen himselfe, and to Iudah it is offered by Ieremie,
                     Ierem. 26. 2, 3. That yet they should hearken and repent, that God might repent of the euill, which for their euill doings he purposed to doe vnto them. Accordingly in Iosiahs time, which was a time of reformation, God spared Iudah, though burdened with these sinnes, for

one and thirtie yeares. And yet to say the truth, it seems that Iudah all that while was but outwardly reformed, and inwardly rotten. Such a blessing to a peopleIer. 25. 3. 5. 7. Zeph. 1. 1. & 3. 1. 2. is a godly Prince, striuing for a true reformation, though attayning but to a seeming one. Yea, it seemes that God did not punish Iudah, vntill they committed sinnes like to those of2. Kin. 24. 3. Ier. 22. 15. 16. &c. 
                     Manasseth. So doth Tremellius interpret that place; yea, Ieremie affirmeth the substance of this interpretation. For hee saith it was well with Iosiah, who did Iustice and Iudgement, but the eyes and the heart of Iehoiakin the sonne of Iosiah
                     
were not, but for his Couetousnesse, for to shed innocent bloud, for oppression and for violence. Behold, a true paterne of the sinnes of Manesseth; but that yet wee may bee sure to finde none of them wanting, let vs heare the Scripture plainely affirming, He did euill in the sight of the Lord, according to ALL that his Fathers had done. And what followes immediately2. Kin. 23. 31. thereupon, In his dayes Nabuchadnezzer came vp, and Iehoiakin became his seruant, and when he rebelled against him, the Lord sent the Caldees, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites against him; yea, hee

sent them against Iudah to destroy it. Thus wee see that Repentance for sinne preserueth a Kingdome, though taynted with crimson and crying sinnes, but the same Kingdome returning from Repentance vnto sinnes, and by new sins resembling the old, beareth the burthen in a fearefull destruction both of the new and the old. Neither hath the mercie of God extended it selfe onely to the penitence of the Iewes, and the Children of the Couenant, but euen to Nineueh, a Citie of the Heathen, and strangers to the Common-wealth of Israel. Yea, by fact hee there approueth

what by word elswhereGods threatnings though neuer so affirmatiue yet vpon a condition haue an implyed Negatiue. he publisheth. That the sentence of punishment though outwardly neuer so positiue, and resolutely affirmatiue, yet inwardly it hath an implyed negatiue, vpon the condition of conuersion and amendment. The Lord saith by Iermie,
                     Ier. 18. 7. 8. When I shall speake of a Nation, and of a Kingdome, to plucke vp and to pull downe, and to destroy it; behold a peremptory sentence of destruction, If that Nation against whom I haue pronounced it turne from their euill, I will repent of the euill I thought to doe vnto them; behold a negatiue of that Affirmatiue

vppon a Condition. God in his deed to Nineueh, is as good as his word by Ieremie, and as he is yesterday, to day, and the same for euer, so at the beginning of dayes, to day and for euer, Hee speakes the word and it is done, his words are most certainely turned into works. A Nation, not the Nation, not the Nation of the Iewes only, but any Nation of the Gentiles, Nineueh, Tyrus and Sidon, yea Brittaine it selfe, hath an assured interest in this promise of God; If wee repent of the euill of our doings, God will certainly repent of the euill ofHierom in Daniel 4. our sufferings. Neque enim
                     
                     Deus hominibus sed vitijs irascitur, quae eum in homine non fuerint, nequaquam punit quod mutatum est. God is not angrie with men but with sins; which sinnes when they are remoued, he punisheth not a man for the sinne which is not in him.

punishments of that Wrath are vpon vs, That this Wrath and punishmens are vpon vs for our sinnes.

Let the Priests, the Ministers of the Lord weepe betweene the Porch and the Altar, and let them say; Spare thy People, O Lord, and giue not thine heritage to reproach; that the Heathen should rule ouer them, wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God? Then will

the Lord be iealous for his Land, and pitie his People. This is the Repentance which God telleth vs is acceptable, Let vs therefore consider it, doe it, and bee confident of acceptation.
               
               
                  
                     SECT. III. Sound Repentance is found to haue in it. First, A confession of sins.
                  ANd if wee will by the direction of this place, ioyntly with others take a view of the mayne parts of Repentance, wee shall especially discouer these. Wee must confesse our iniquities, confessing wee must loath them, and bewayle them,

and loathing and lamenting wee must turne to the contrarie Righteousnesse, and to this wee must ioyne vehement inuocation. Wee may well confesse our sinnes in Repenting them, for we haue confessed them in acting them: Our sinnes with Sodome were not hid in the doing, let them not with Adam be hid in the curing. Yea, those that are more secret, God by punishments hath now publikely proclaymed, As in Absolons open Incest, Dauids secret Adulterie was punished. Wherefore, if wee had not shame to doe that sinne by which God was offended, and wee are

punished; Let vs not take shame to tell what wee haue done by a confession, wherin God is appeased and wee are eased. Shame properly belongs to sin done, though denied, but shame belongs not to sin vndone, though confessed. And surely, what by corruption hath beene done, by repentance is vndone. In confessing our sins, we accuse our sinnes rightly as the causes of our punishments, and wee glorifie God clearing him and his Iustice in punishing. ThisLeu 26. 48. is that which God calleth the accepting of his punishment, which is one condition of remouing it; for we cannot but approoue and

accept that punishment, which wee confesse hath beene iustly deserued. Accordingly Daniel

For certainly, except wee acknowledge our sicknesse, the Physician that came only to heale the sick wil not heale vs, being healthie in our owne opinion.

Let vs therefore confesse our sicknesse, that wee may be healed, and not couer it with the shew of health, that we may neuer be recouered. When wee confesse our sinnes vnto God, wee tell God no more then hee knowes before, for our sins as all things else are naked before his eyes: But by the telling of our sinnes God knowes, that wee know them to bee sinnes, without which knowledge and acknowledgement there can be no conuersion, and without conuersion there can be no cure. How can any turne from those deeds which they acknowledge not to be sins, and how can that be amēded

which is not known to be a fault? Then is a Man wakened, and ceasseth to dreame when he telleth his dreames, and when we tell the vaine fantasies of our sinfull actions, it is a signe we are departed from them. Therefore Confession must bee the first step to Conuersio

                  TO this Confession of sinnes, should bee ioyned a Detestation of the

sinnes confessed. Wee must detest the sinnes that wee haue done, and our selues for doing them, and out of this detestation must arise an anger, yea, a resolution of reuenge against our selues. That our sinnes may appeare loath some, we need no more but in one view to looke vpon them, and look vpon Gods Law, and the puritie of the one will shew vs plainly the filthinesse of the other. And if we cannot well discerne the vglinesse of our sinnes, Let vs view the shapes which the seruants of God haue drawn of them, whereof some models are giuen in this Treatise, and else where Diseases of the time, &c. enlarged.

Surely, there is nothing more vgly then a sinner. For the face and character of his Creation is like a face whose parts are either scratched away, turned vpside downe, or couered with most lothsome corruption. This vgly deformitieTo detest sinne wee must see it, as God sees it. the Lord seeth plainly, and sheweth it to vs by most forcible comparisons. Hee expresseth the loathsomnesse of Sinners, by the most loathsome estate of a Child in the bloud of his birth. Ezek. 16.

couered ouer all with blisters, swellings and corruption. Againe, if the RighteousnesseEsa. 64 6. of sinfull man be compared to a cloth of extreamest pollution, what comparison can wee fit for his sinfulnesse? Let vs then looke on our selues, with the same eyes that God lookes on vs, and then shall wee see our selues iust as lothsome as God doth see vs. A spirituall eye-sight,That is, Spiritually. quickned by the eye-salue of the Spirit, will make both vs and Laodicea plainlyReu. 3. 11. to behold our Blindnes, our Nakednesse, and our Miserie. If a Drunkard with sober eyes could see himselfe drunke, he would

appeare to himselfe as a most lothsome and beastly apparition. If a Swearer, with a temperate soule and awfull of his Creator, could heare himselfe swearing, cursing, and tearing his Maker and Sauiour, hee would thinke hee heard a mad man, and one farre madder then hee that curseth his Father, and draggeth his Mother by the hayre of her head.

Death, shall be ioyned the terrour of an affrighting Conscience; whereas on the other side, a comfortable Conscience is an absolute Remedie for the terror of Death.

businesse to the Night of Death, wherein men cannot well worke, and wherein vgly sights doe vsually most affright vs. But let vs in our liues with Iehoshua put off the rags of our filthinesse, and with the inuited Guests put on the wedding Garment, that when the Bridegroome calls, wee may haue no other businesse, but to enter with him to his eternall Ioyes.
               
               
                  
                     SECT. V. Anger and Reuenge, the true issues of Detestation of sinne.
                  ANaturall and kindly issue of this detestation

of sinne, is an anger or indignation with our sins, and our selues for sinning. The penitent sinner is at odds with himselfe for his sinnes; yea he, hateth himselfe, and from this Indignation, ariseth a desire of Reuenge vpon himselfe for sinning. A commendable wrath and an excellent reuenge. He confesseth himselfeReuenge two-fold. worthy of all the punishments of God because he hath offended him, and taking Gods part as it were against himselfe, hee pronounceth1. sentence of punishmentOutward. against himselfe, and executeth it soundly. His body he appointeth to the punishment of sackcloath,

ashes, watching, labour and fasting, or other Asperities; on his heart he puts the sack-cloth of compunction2. Inward. and sorrow. And indeed this inward sackcloath is that which giues worth to the outward, for the hanging downe of the head without the humbling of the heart is to God a detestable sacrifice. It can hardly bee, that a heart duly humbled, should not communicate some humbling to the bodie, but if it might be, it were farre better that the heart should bee humbled without the humbling of the body, then that the body should bee humbled without the humbling

of the heart. But it is fittest that since both haueBoth 
                           •…
                        t and vsually necessary. sinned, both should bee humbled; so to auoyd the fault of the superstitious that with a proud and supererogating heart, haue a fasting body, and to auoyd the dissolutenesse of the Licentious that say they are grieued in heart, when the griefe of the heart imparteth not it selfe to the body, that had a chiefe part in the sinne. The Law of sinne Paul calleth the law of the members, Why should not then the members also bee punished wherein is the Nest of the law of sinne? Lust when it defiles the soule by sinne,

the sinne of Lust is commonly vshered with some filthy pleasure. Now when Repentance goes about to cleanse the soule, by a godly sorrow it purgeth away the filth which sinfull pleasure hath left behind it. Yea it is not onely content to sweepe the filth of sinfull lust out of the soule by the besome of sorrow, but by it and exercises sutable to it, it would sweepe it out of the body also, if it were possible, and so make all cleane by sweeping all filth out of doores. Therefore as by sorrow it casteth the dregs of sinfull Lust out of the heart, so by fasting and other mortifying exercises it

seekes to driue it out of the body, that both soule and body may be cleane. Neither let the Papists haue anyAnd therefore no pre-eminence in doing it to be allowed to Papists, but onely in the pride and indiscretion of doing it. aduantage on vs in the exercises of humiliation, but onely in doing it more arrogantly, and more indiscreetly. To doe it for Merit, or to disable the body, Let these be their priuiledges; But in doing it for a penitent humiliation, and with a measure that keepes the body seruiceable to the soule, true Doctrine giues them no precedence. And therefore, though they brag to their Disciples of their Religion as the onely teacher of Discipline, and accuse ours as the teacher of

Licentiousnesse, they deceiue and are deceiued. Licentious men there are on both sides; and as some of ours puffe themselues vp with Libertie after sinning, so some of theirs glut their flesh before their penance for sinne; witnesse the most mad Licentiousnesse that commonly fore▪runs their Lenten-fasting. Vpon this is grounded an Apothegme of an Heathen, that the Christians are mad one time of the yeare, vntill one come and cast Ashes on them, and then they recouer their wits againe. But there are among vs holy and deuout men, that practise and aproue a reuenge

on the flesh, and euen in these times desire it; For most true it is that either for the weakning of sinne in vs, or for humbling vs hauing sinned, the punishment of the flesh is an excellent Medicine. But of aVoluntary penance, no satis

hath tempered the rigour of the Law, for in the Law it is written, He that offendeth let him dye the death, or bee ouer-whelmed with stones. But our Maker hath appeared in our flesh, and to the confession of sinnes (Non paenam fed vitam promittit) he doth not promise a punishment but life; hee receiues a woman confessing her wounds, and sends her away whole.

But vnder the standard of the Scriptures I may march valiantly, because vnresistably. In the storie of Iehosaphat, first is the fast, and then the deliuerance; In the prophesie of Ionah, first is the fast of Nineueh, and then the deliuerance, and without these

deliuerances both the stomacke and the meat had beene lost. In the prophesieI

A short emptinesse, shall bring a long fulnesse; and therefore fast that yee may bee full, for in this point also, Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled. True it is, that turning must bee ioyned with fasting, but fasting also by Gods owne prescription is fit to bee ioyned with turning.Ioel. 2. 12.
                     
And why should we not willingly fast, since wee see it so inseperablie attended with deliuerances and plentie? Wee may be confident in Mercie, since it may not be thought that what hath neuer fayled others, should now begin to fayle vs. Wee haue read that the wrath of God indureth but a moment, but we read that his Mercie indureth for euer. Surely, God is not changeable in his Mercie, wherefore let vs bee the same with others in our humiliation, and let vs be assured that God will be the same for euer in his Mercie.

                        -sauing Papists, that by knowing the proper worke of it, they do not appoint it to doe that for which Christs bloud was appointed. and expulsion of sin. God is satisfied with the Man humbled for sinne, but not with that humiliation as a satisfaction to his Iustice, but as a condition accepted by this mercy and goodnesse. It is the bloud of Christ onely that payes Gods iustice, the iust price of punishment for our sins, but the punishment of our selues is a part of our penitence, and penitence fitteth vs for the receit of the merits and satisfaction of Christ Iesus. For Christ that payed an equall price

for our sinnes by his death, doth not impart this satisfaction of his Death, but to those that by his Spirit are made conformable to his Death. As Christ dyed for sinne, so Christians must die to sinne, and therefore by one Spirit Christ giues vs both the Death for sin, and the Death of sinne; Now in this humiliation and selfe-judging for sinne, we giue his Spirit leaue and power to ransack our harts and to kill the sinne that offended God; yea, by the same wee expresse and testifie our hatred of that sinne, and our cōuersion to God. And we being thus conformed to the death of Christ,

the death of Christ doth giue it selfe to vs, or rather vnto God for vs. For his iustifying Death is imparted by a mortifying and sanctifying Spirit, our penitent Conuersion is the condition of Gods Absolution, and then the Death of Christ is the ransome of our sinnes, when the Spirit of Christ in penitence purgeth the sinne that defileth vs. For as elsewhere I haueArt of H

                      shewed, in sinnes there is guilt and a blot; The soule is thereby guiltie, & thereby filthy. Now, God hath so ordered it, that the taking away of the filth should goe with the taking away of the guilt, and

therefore Christs iustifying bloud is giuen vs by the sanctifying Spirit, & with the taking away of the filth, the taking away of the guilt is conioyned. The Parable of Christ, with some likenesse, and some difference, may make it more cleare to lower capacities. The Father hath two Sonnes, and the yonger cals for his portion and spends it; yea, hee makes a debt beyond it, and sets it on his Fathers Account. Afterward, he is sorry for his prodigalitie, he returns to his fathers house, and there desires his elder brother to mediate for him. The Brother intreates the Father, he offers payment

of the debt, only he intreats mercy and pardon for his Brother. The Father lookes aswell for amendment, as for satisfaction, and wil not accept this elder Sonnes satisfaction, vntill he be assured of his younger Sonnes penitence and conuersion. To testifie this, it appeares to the father that he hateth his former life, because he hateth himselfe for it, and out of that hatred hee punisheth himselfe with fasting, lying on the ground, and humbling himselfe to an equalitie with seruants. Vpon this penitent humiliation, his brothers satisfaction is accepted. It is the elder brother that satisfies,

but the penitence of the yonger makes him capable of that satisfaction. So after our sins, Christs bloud is still the propitiation of our sinnes, but by serious penitence (the fruit of his mortifying Spirit, & wherof these exercises of humiliation are fruits) that propitiation is made ours, and is receiued for vs. This is no new Truth, but hath been anciently known and approued.

Then onely doe the punishments for sinne take their leaue of vs, when wee are thus turned from sinne. For, this turning sets our soules in ioynt againe, which sinne had displaced; yea, hauing set vs in tune within our selues, it tuneth vs also at once to our Maker; And when wee are

Cor. 7. 1. such promises, let vs by true turning and repentance, cleanse our selues from all filthinesse of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holinesse in the feare of God.

punishmens are the part which God deliuereth vnto vs; and such a loathsome looke as the punishments expresse vnto vs, such and a more loathsome looke doe our sinnes present vnto God. So in the one we shall reade the other, in our punishments wee shall reade our sinnes. But if wee blot out that counterpart of our sinnes, God will also blot out that counter part of his Iudgements; and vntill then, let vs complaine of our sinnes, and not of our punishments; of our sinnes that wilfully continue them, and not of the Iudgements which are necessarily continued by our sinnes. For

surely it were pitie, that sin should prosper and grow greater by impunitie. Let our malice therefore bee conuerted from any thing that punisheth vs, to the sinne, by which it came to punish vs; and let vs be assured, that when wee are turned from sinne, the creatures shall bee turned from punishing. In our selfeiudging let vs take greatest notice of our greatest sins, and next of our strongest sinnes, which though lesser in shew, yet comming thicker by their vsuall preuayling, must haue a great strength of opposition and repentance. Wee must turne greatly from our great sins,

and weep bitterly for them, wee must striue mightily with our strong sinnes, and beseech the Lord thrice for them; yea, let vs not leaue prayer and vnutterable groanes, vntill the house of Saul grow weaker, and the house of Dauid grow stronger. Let the Drunkard striue to turne from his drunkennesse, and though he find it a little hard in the beginning, yet at length he shall feele it more easie; and that a custome of Sobrietie, is farre more comfortable to bee kept, then a custome of Beastlinesse. The drie soule is the wisest and best soule, & so most fitClem. Alex. paed. lib. 2. cap. 2. for diuine contemplation,

Let the Extortioner by turning mercifull, once taste the sweetnesse of Mercie, and of that Manna of Charitie, which is the very Honey of Heauen, and hee will say, that the taste of brotherly loue is farre sweeter then the taste of the heart-bloud of his brother.

Let the Sacriligious person striue to turne from his Couetousnesse, and see what odds of comfort there is in the soule of him that hath giuen of his owne to the Church, or giuen freely to the Church the things of the Church, & of him that hath starued the Church or a Church-man, and hee will not spare the Heauen of a good conscience, for all the earthly benefits, that haue Hell by their sides. Yea, let euery sinner looke vpon his euery sinne, either in this Treatise named, in others iustly reproued, or in his owne Conscience registred and he shall gayne thereby to himselfe the

ioyes of a good Soule, and shall procure to himselfe and vs all, a freedome from the euill of punishments.A powerfull goodnes should be placed in the stead of sinne supplanted. Neither let vs onely search out our sinnes and forsake them, but let vs striue to plant in our selues a solide and powerfull goodnesse. For such a goodnesse is only able to keepe out sinne, when it is thrust out, since we haue to doe with strong temptations, and a strong tempter. Thinne and shadowie holinesse, and a shew of goodnesse, betrayes vs to all offers of sinne; and let it be sufficient that hereby wee haue alreadie receiued so many hurts, armed with too sleight an armour for a

Christian souldier, euen with a talking and not a walking holinesse. But let vs striue by all meanes to fortifie the spirit in vs, by which wee are fortified against the spirit which is in the world; and let vs not leaue praying, fasting, reading, meditating, vntill we feele the pulses of the spirit beat strongly, whose strength is the great prefernatiue against sinne, and the mayne stablisher of our feete in the way of peace and holinesse.
               
               
                  
                  
                     SECT. IX. Secondly, Wee should procure others to turne from their sinnes.
                  NEither must wee moue our selues only to confesse, detest, and forsake sinnes; but we must endeuour to draw others also to the same duties of Repentance. There is among vs a Natural communion, a PolitickeBound thereunto by a threefold band. 
                           •…
                        
                      communion, and a Spirituall communion. We are of one flesh and bloud, of one Common-wealth, of one Communion of Saints. And each of these Communions are forcible motiues and reasons, that incite vs to communicate

goodnesse each vnto other; The members wee are of one Nation, of one Kingdome, of one Church; It were a monstrous thing if the hand should not set a playster on a bruised foot, nor the head studie a remedie for a sickly bodie. Yea, there is yet another Communitie, and that is, a CommunionYea, a fourefold. of Misery, and this vsually procures mutuall Pittie, and this pittie, succour and reliefe. As the good Thiefe rescued Christ from the reuyling of the bad one, saying; Wee all are vnder one condemnation; So should wee say, Generall punishments haue inflicted generall smarts,

and losses; Let vs thereforeSt. Iude 22. 23. striue to saue one another with compassion, and1. Heretofore begun by the Magistrat. 2. Chro. 20. 3.
                      to pull one another out of the fire of Gods Indignation. If you aske where this should begin, I will tell you where it hath begun. When a generall Danger threatned Iudah, Iehosaphat the King of Iudah feared, and set himselfe to seeke the Lord, and proclaimed a Fast throughout all Iudah. When Iosiah heard but the threatnings of God against sinnes, and knew that those sinnes were committed, to which those threatnings did belong, the King stood in his place, & made a Couenant before

the Lord, to walke after the Lord, and to keepe his2. Chro. 34. Commandements, and his Testimonies, and his Statutes, with all his heart, and all his soule, and caused all that were present to stand to it. When Ionah did but pronounce the sentence of Destruction vpon Nineueh, (wee heare of no Plagues present vppon it, no Enemies vndermining it by policies, nor oppugning itIona. 3. 6. by force) the King of Nineueh arose from his Throne, hee layd his Robe from him, and couered him with Sackcloath, and sate in Ashes, and it was proclaimed through Nineueh, by the King and the Nobles; Let

neither Man, nor Beast, Herd nor Flocke, taste any thing, let them not feed nor drinke water. But let man and beast bee couered with sack cloath, and cry mightily vnto God; yea, let them turne euery one from his euill way, and from the violence that is in their hands. And as sure as they repented, so sure they were preserued. Now S. Paul saith, That the things whichRom. 25. 14 were written here to fore, were here to fore written for our instruction. Surely, the greatest power worketh greatest effects, and a Reformation is neuer so publike, as when they that haue the most power on the publike

set it on worke. The Magistrate by good Lawes, by causing good execution of good Lawes, and by good Example is a most Catholike Reformer. The people tooke notice of2. Sam.

                     Dauids fasting for the murder of Abner, and it pleased them, for whatsoeuer the King did that pleased the people. And not onely the higher Magistrates are causes of Reformation, but the Lower in being carefull to suppresse Vice by lawfull punishments, and to strengthen Vertue by lawfull incouragements. Yea, their examples also may communicate, either much goodnesse, or much infection.

Next to the publique2. The Minister ought to call others to turne from their finnes. Magistrate, the Minister is a most publique-Person. Therefore it concernes him also to tell the People their sins, and to call them from their transgressions. Ezra the high Priest prepared his heart to seeke the Law of the Lord, and to doe it, and to teach in Israel Statutes and Iudgments. Yea,Ezra. 7. 10. he rent his Garment for the sinnes of the People, and called them to the reuersing of their sinnes, vntill the fierce wrath of the Lord should bee turned away from them. Yea, thisand 9, 10. hath beene the mayne office of the Priests, and Prophets of God to turne them

from their sinnes, and so toFor the Minister is a Watch man to descry both Sins and Iudgements. turn away the punishments belonging to their sinnes. These are the Watch-men set vpon the Towre of diuine Speculation, looking a farre off to see both the sinnes of the People, and the punishments of God comming for their sinnes, and to giue notice of both to the People. Thus standing in their watch, if with the seruant of Eliah they see but a little cloud arising, they call to Ahabs, to Sinners, to escape betime from the Tempests that will follow. In Esay, a WatchmanEsa. 21. 11. standeth in the watch-towr and speakes vnto Sinners. The Morning comes and

also the Night, if yee will enquire, enquire, returne and come. Ieremie was setIerem. 7. in a watch-towre, and then the Word of the Lord comes to him, Make your wayes good and your actions right, And thinke not to steale and kil, and sweare falsly, and to worship Idols, and to trust in the Temple of the Lord, for as I destroyed Shiloh for the wickednesse of Israel, so will I destroy the Temple for the wickednesse of Iudah. Ezekiel
                     Eze. 3. 2. is set on a watch-towre to receiue the Word from God, and to deliuer it to the People. If God say to the wicked he shall die, the Prophet himselfe shall die,

if he doe not tell this message of Death to the wicked: Habbakuk stands in hisHab. 2. watch, to heare what the Lord wil say vnto him, and hauing receiued the Word of the Lord, he proclaimes it to the people. Woe be to him that couets an euill Coueteousnesse, to set his neast on high aboue the reach of Miserie. Woe be vnto him that builds a Citie with bloud, and that establisheth it by Iniquitie. Woe bee vnto him that giueth drinke to his Neighbour, adding his Bottle, and making him drunke, that hee may behold his shame Yea, Christ Iesus himselfe the Mediator of the New

Testament, and our chiefest King, Priest, and Prophet, to the Scribes and Pharises expresseth their sinnes, and denounceth the woes belonging to them. And Ierusalem her selfe with teares he calleth to repentance, offering to gather her vnder the wings of an Almightie protection; Our Sauiour would, but Ierusalem would not. Saint Peter
                     Acts 3. also, an excellent Scholer of that highest Teacher, tells the Iewes plainly, that they haue denyed the holy One, and desired a Murderer, and killed the Prince of Life; and withall he calls them to Repentance and Conuersion, that their sins

may bee blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come. Now, whereunto doth all this amount being cast vp into a summe? That it is the office of the Ministers to see the sinnes of the People, to see the Iudgements of God comming vpon those sinnes, and by Repentance to call the People from their sinnes, and so to saue them from the Iudgements. ThereforeThe Ministers must be Seers and Cryers. euen at this Day must the Ministers bee Seers, they must see sinnes, and see iudgments. And they must be Cryers aswell as Seers, for when they see the sins, they must giue Men notice of the punishments that attend

them, and when they see the plagues, they must giue men notice of the sins that cause them; yea, when they see both, as at this Time, they must giue notice of both. Euen now isEsa. 58. 1. Eze. 11. 13. the word Clama sent out to the Ministers, to cry aloud and spare not, euen to lift vp their voyce as a Trumpet. Wherefore, let them not be silent, nor hold their peace for Sions sake, lest the Prophet die for not spea king, and the People for not hearing: Better it is to cry aloud a cry of penitence that brings forth safetie and rejoycing; then to cry bitterly hereafter in a cry of torment, when there

shall bee none to deliuer. Therefore, let each Pastor of a Flock take heed to the Flock, whereof the Holy Ghost hath made him Ouer-seer, and in his Flock search and discouer the sins that are there most dangerous, and shew his Flock both the sinnes & the danger. Let him cal vpon them strongly for Repentance, euen this three-fold dutie of Repentance: Confession, Detestation, and Conuersion, by them striuing to dismount the sinnes of the Time, which like so many Canons are planted against vs, being full charged with the Iudgements of God. There is none that spareth

his flock more, then he that spares the sinnes of his flockRepentance is euer safe, Impenitence euer dangerous least. You see a strong Ground and impregnable Examples, warranting this Action. And if carnall Securitie could truly say (as it is readie to say any thing; yea, to sinne quietly vnto Death, rather then to take the paines of Repentance) that there is no feare of such a wrath, as speculatiue men may forge out of the strength of Imagination, yet this is all the danger of this side, That by perswading Repentance, men are lesse sinfull, more iust, and more safe; whereas on the other side, If our Sins, and Gods Iudgements bee so

neere together, as the foresaid Proofes doe inforce, the danger of vnrepentance is no little one, but an vtter ouerthrow, and an abomination of desolation. Let vs therefore striue by the profitable practice of penitence, to make our selues assured of safetie, rather then by an vnprofitable Impenitence to hazard an vtter ruine and destruction. Repentance is a thing neuer2. Cor. 7. 10. to be repented of; ButRom. 2. 5. hardnesse of heart, and a heart that cannot repent, heapeth vp wrath against the day of wrath; And then there will bee no place forHeb. 12. 17. repentance; yea, though thou shouldest seeke it with

teares. Next to the Minister,3. The Master of a Familie, ought to turne sinne out of his Familie. let vs speak to the Maister of a Familie, who is a kinde of publique priuate person. For an House, is a little Church, and a little Commonwealth; and of many such little Churches, and litle Commonwealths, doth the great Church and the great Commonwealth consist. Accordingly in this little Church, the Maister of the Familie hath leaue toPro. 23. 13. reforme by instruction, and in this Common-wealthPro. 29. 19. he hath power to reforme by Correction, when Instruction will not serue. Abraham
                     Gen. 18. 19. is loued and commended, because hee will command his children, and

his houshold after him to keepe the way of the Lord. Iaakob also purgeth and reformethGen. 35. his house, putting out the strange gods that were therein. Ioshua is resolute,Iosh. 24. 15. though all Israel be contrarie to him, hee and his house will serue the Lord. Dauid promiseth reformation in his house, as well as in his Kingdom. He that worketh deceit shall not dwell in mine house, he that telleth lyes shall not tarry in my sight. These paternes should the MaistersPsal. 101. of the Families propose; which if they were followed, the reformation of all particulars, would be a reformation of the generall.

The house of the wicked, saith Solomon, shall bee ouerthrowne;Pro. 14. 11. but the Tabernacle of the Righteous shal flourish. Wilt thou then keep that wickednesse that may be the ouerthrow of thine house, and not make Righteousnesse thy Guest, which will make thy house to flourish? Againe, as wickednesse

makes one house to decay, so many wicked houses together by proportion make a Land to decay; so by not reforming thy house, thou art an vndoer of thy familie, and a Traytor to thy Countrey. Lastly,4. Each man striue to turne his Friend and his Neighbor. let euery friend to his friend, euery neighbour to his neighbour (yea, though he be but such a neighbour as the Iew was to the Samaritane) let him by admonition, and instruction call him to reformation. If thou feest thy enemies Oxe goe out of the way, thou must turne him into the way, how much more thine enemies soule, wandring in the way that leadeth

to destruction. Yea, for thine owne sake thou shouldest doe it, for by his sinne, the Land and thou in the Land may perhaps be punished; but by reforming his sinne, the Land and thou in the Land may bee spared. But if the wicked will not be reclaymed from his wickednesse, let the righteous mourne for5. If the wicked fayle, let the righteous turne the more strongly. the wicked, and strengthen each other in Righteousnesse. Let them mourne for the wicked, that so all sins may be repented, if not by the sinners them selues, yet by the righteous, which lament, euen for this that sinners doe not lament. Let that which wanteth in the

wicked bee made vp by the godly, and let them mourne a double mourning, one for their owne, and another for other mens sinnes. So shallAnd double his mourning no sinnes bee left vnrepented, and hereby shall they at the least haue this benefit, they shall be Gods marked mourners, and they shal bee like the marked posts of the Israelites in Egypt; GodsEzck. 9. 4. plagues shall passe ouer them. Let the godly alsoAnd strēgthen each other in holinesse. strengthen each other in goodnesse and godlinesse. For the godly are the buttresses of a Kingdome, and the more ruinous a Kingdome is, the stronger should the buttresses bee that support it. Tenne such Pillars

would haue supported Sodom from falling, and their prayers would haue cried lowder in Gods eares for mercy, then the sinnes of thousands did for vengeance. And if they cannot saue a multitude of sinners, yet themselues shall bee saued from wrath in the Day of wrath. WhenMal

that I make vp my Iewels, and I will spare them as a man spareth his owne sonne that serueth him.

pressed in fasting and weeping) and a conuersion from sinne vnto God; hee also addes; Let the Priests and the Ministers of the Lord betweene the Porch and the Altar say, Spare thy people O Lord, and giue not thine heritage to reproach, that the Heathen should rule ouer them. Wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God? And see what followes immediatly, Then will the Lord be iealous for his Land, and pitie his People. The prayer of a penitent heart is a most acceptable Sacrifice; yea, it is an acceptable Sacrifice offered vp by an acceptable Sacrifice.

For, first a penitent heart it selfe, as Dauid sayes,Ps. 51. is by excellence the Sacrifice of God; and next the calues of our lips are an acceptable sacrifice of that sacrifice. So the penitent heart, which of it selfe is a sacrifice, is to prayer an Altar. An excellent Altar from which ascends a sacrifice of sweet sauour into the presence of the Almightie. Therefore Dauid rightlyPsal. 34. 15, 16. orders his song, when hee sayth; first, Depart from euill and doe good, seeke peace and pursue it, And when hee seconds it thus; The eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous, and his eares are open to his crie.

children of Israel had mockedIudg. 10. 15 with God oft in a false and short repentance, so that God had put them off with a deniall; yet putting away their Idols, and to their repentance ioyning vehement inuocation, they were heard in that which they feared. So true is thatIob 33. of Elihu, The penitent man shall pray vnto God, and he will be fauourable vnto him, and hee shall see his face with ioy. It is sinne only that clogs our prayers, and keeps them from ascending vnto God. The stinking smoake of our sinnes infects the smoake of our prayers, and makes them vnsauorie in the nostrils of

the Almightie. If therefore our sinnes be put away, and a pure heart send vp pure prayers, let it be confident, for there is no doubt of hearing. The Lord hathEsa. 58. 9. said it, whose word is stronger then the Couenant of the Sunne and Moone. Then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer, thou

Let vs neuer complaine of God but of our selues, if wee be not saued, for God hath promised deliuerance to the prayer of the penitent; Let vs therfore neuer leaue reponting and praying, for we may be assured that the end will bee preuayling.

This is the way, let vs walke in it, yea let vs lie downe in it, and with the woman of Canaan, let delayes or seeming denyals increase the strength of our Cries, for there is no doubt but Importunitie will preuayle; and if our prayers mount vp vncessantly to God, our Sauiour wil come to vs assuredly with health vnder his wings.

                  BVt if the present punishments doe not bring foorth this fruit of Repentance, wherof they are in trauell, then must wee needs enter into a fifth Consideration, and that must be this, That where Gods lesser punishments preuayle not to amendment, there the greater will issue forth and preuayle vnto Destruction. This is a most lamentable Cure of our sins, and farre

more bitter then that potion of Repentance which men so much abhorre. Repentance with some sorrow bringeth forth ioy, but in Destruction, sorrow brings forth onely sorrow. GOD himselfe giues vs the Character of it, A trembling Heart, and fayling of eyes, and sorrow of heart. ThyDeu. 28. 65. life shall hang in doubt before thee.

                  Hierom. in Ezek. lib. 1. cap. 1. 
                  &c. Drop thy word to the South. Drop thy word saith Hierome, that the whole wrath of God seeme not to be powred out, but some drop or part of it. But if a Drop bee so full of terrour, how terrible shall wee thinke are the whole showres of his wrath?] Let not then the drops seeme little to vs, least we feele the showres too great for vs. The best and safest way is

to make our sins, and GodsSins and punishments by seeming little grow greater, and by seeming great grow lesser. Iudgements appeare in their true greatnesse; for when wee truely see their greatnesse, that sight in penitent men makes them both to grow lesser. But when they both seeme lesse then they are, then they both grow bigger. Neither let vs be so nice and selfe▪louing, as to thinke that the punishments which we haue suffered, are not great enough to inforce a general humiliation, For one or two of these punishments, haue beene a ground sufficient for the Prophets of God to call for a publike penitence.

Gods armie, the Canker and Caterpiller had destroyed their fruits. And Haggai calls the people to the Consideration and amendment of their wayes, because they sowed much and reaped little, and put their wages into a broken bagge. And a reuerend FatherGreg. Naz. of the ancient Church vpon a tempest of hayle, calls on the people to possesse their soules in teares, to sanctifie a Fast, and to amend their liues. Let vs therefore bee no wiser then the Prophets and Saints; yea, let vs be no worse then the Scribes and Pharises, whom Iohn Baptist termed a generation of Vipers, and

yet were forewarned to flie from the wrath to come. Let vs make profit of Gods chastisements, and let that profit bee Repentance, and the profit of Repentance will bee the remoouing of the Chastisements. Let vs speake vnto GOD in theEzra 9.

Wouldest thou not bee angrie with vs till thou hadst consumed vs? Since Gods punishments

haue beene lesse then our sinnes; yea, hee hath giuen vs many deliuerances, should wee partake with sinnes and sinners any more, that so by increasing our sinnes wee may increase our punishments, vntill they amount to a finall destruction? It is meet to be spoken to God (saith Elihu) I haue borne chastisement, I will not offend any more. If it be meet to be said, let vs say what is meet to bee said, but let vs say it truely, or else we doe not meetly say what is meet to be said. Let vs from the heart make a Couenant with God, and say we haue borne chastisement, wee

will offend no more. Let vs bee contented with these punishments which wee haue alreadie receiued, and let vs not by continuance in sinnes make them too little for vs. Let vs ratherNe
