               AS in all Actions and attemptes (Right Honorable) it is moste requiſite to chooſe out ſuche as are moste politique and prudent performers, ſo in cauſes of protection it is moſte neceſſarie to account of ſuche as are greateſt fauoures of the cauſe, whereuppon: knowyng your Honor to bee a Piller and vnderproppe of true Chriſtianitie, a maintainer of Religion, and a zealous profeſſor of the Gospell, J thought it not amiſſe, to offer theſe trifles (in wiſemens Judgementes, yet diuine miracles in the wilfull and Ignoraunt Papistes opinion) to your Honor, to be ſafcundited vnder your graue title, and the rather, for that my ſimplicitie ſhall finde ſauegarde vnder ſo Honorable a name, and my good meanyng (whiche would ſtretche farre

if abilitie were coreſpondent) might be manifeſt vnto you, who haue bounde me by ſeuerall good turnes, and in whom thoſe in neceſſitie alwaies finde refuge.
            Maie it pleaſe you therefore to giue it the ouerreading, and as it deſerueth, the laughyng at, and as your Honor likes of the miracles, ſo imparte it for the ſtraungenes to thoſe ſhall beſt like you. And thus J moste humbly take my leaue.

            The report of a late practiſe enterpriſed by a Papiste.
            
               THe vnaduiſed regard of the worlde now a daies (courteous reader) in pubilſhing printed vntruthes, to bryng in varietie of vanities (for the better ſatiſfiyng of idle heades) almoſte withdraweth my mynde from my pretenſed purpoſe. But for that I am moſte aſſuredly perſwaded, and not induced onely by reportes, but confirmed by learned and diſcrite beholders, my ſelf beeyng an eye witneſſe to ſome parte, it maketh me therefore nothyng doubtfull to laie open to the worlde, a thyng of moſte aſſured veritie, and with all a moſte peſtiferous practiſe of a groſhedded Papiſte but lately put in vre: Not doubtyng but that all thynges ſhall drawe to a good exigent, ſince the groundes be ſo certaine.
            And whereas it maie be wondered, why amongſt the reſt my ſelf onely adicted to Militarie profeſſion, ſhould dare preſume to enter into thoſe matters, which by Antichriſt and his vpholders are deemed to be more then demy heauenly: Know you, that two ſpeciall cauſes haue drawne me to it: The one the ſeriouſe perſwaſions of deare freendes, namely (amongſt many others) Maiſter Richard Ioyner a Phiſition dwelling in Cheſter, ſometymes a diſciple of the Popes, and a cheefe companion in Oxenford, with our late halowed, Sainct Edmunde Campion, and now (by Gods permiſſion) both hym ſelf freed from his former follies, and deſirous that others ſhould be warned of the like.
            My ſeconde reaſon is, for that I finde the matter ſo ſimple, as I eſteeme it to inſufficient to deſerue the ouerlooking of the learned, and yet ſo pernicious, as it could not eſcape the ſcoffe of a Souldier, who as in tyme of warre, he is bounde to his Countries behoofe with his Pike, ſo in cauſes that grow within compaſſe of his coniecture (beeyng profitable to the Commonweale) 
                  •
               e is not to with holde his penne.
            So it is, that hauyng been in Irelande vpon her Maieſtes

affaires, I made my returne accompanied with the worſhipfull Captaine Thomas North, brother to the right honorable the Lord North Captaine Thomas Maria Wyngfeeld with ſundrie others that can likewiſe teſtifie a truthe in this cauſe, it was our chaunce to ariue at Cheſter on Satirdaie beeyng the thirde of Marche this preſent yere 1582. where amongeſt other matters of worthineſſe, we heard greate good reporte, of that graue and ſtudiouſe diuine Maiſter Goodman, who as we vnderſtoode the next daie was appoincted to preache, we beyng deſirous to ſtaie our Iourney on the Sabboth day, addreſſed our ſelues to Churche, where to our greate edification, wee heard the learned diſcourſe of Maiſter Goodman, whoſe bolſome aduertiſements, tended to the confuſion of errour, admoniſhyng his hearers, to beware of the ſubtill practiſes of Papiſtes, whiche were continually buſied with ſeduſing the ſimple and ignorant.
            In the ende of his Sermon, there ſtoode foorthe in open veiwe a young Maiden, called by the name of Elizabeth Orton borne in Orton Madocke in the Countie of Flint, & Dioces of Cheſter, about the yeres of fourteene or fifteene of proper perſonage, and the Daughter of Ihon Orton yet liuyng, and dwellyng in Orton a foreſaied. This young Maiden, before the whole aſſembly there preſent after the Sermon, deliuered this proteſtation Verbatim as followeth.

                           GOod people, you ſhal vnderſtand, that J Elizabeth Orton haue been ſeduced by a vile runnagate Papiſt, named Sir Hughes, once Scholemaſter in Orton Madocke,

where my father dwelleth, who hauing (as J right well perceiued ſince) an intent to deceiue the ſimple and Ignorant people, and to cary thē from the light of the Gospell into the darkeneſſe of Papistrie, abuſed the ſimplicitie of my tender yeres, and brought me to beleeue, that if I would not doe as he instructed me, J could neuer be ſaued, and ſo puttyng me in feare that my ſoule could not otherwiſe eſcape eternall damnation, he wrought me at length to yeeld to his perſwaſions and allurements, and cauſed me to take vppon me, that J ſawe Ʋiſions of the fire of Purgatorie, and affirme that I was laid therein, and of the Maſſe, and of the Mother of Chriſt, and ſundrie others which of truth J did not ſee: But now beyng of more diſcretion then at that tyme I was, and knowing better of true Religion (God be therefore thanked) then at that tyme J did, I doe here before God and you proteſt, that thoſe Ʋiſions whiche are reported to bee ſeen of me, J neuer did ſee neither did know, what ſuche matter meaneth, neither did euer ſee any Maſſe, or any ſigne of fire of Purgatorie, or any ſuch thing in viſion or out of viſion, but was miſſeled by the wicked counſaile, and falſe practiſes, of that

naughtie fellowe Hughes, to affirme and ſaie, J ſawe ſuche thynges as J did indeede neuer ſee, whereof J doe hartely deſire you all to beware of trayterous Papistes, and to take heede how you harken or giue eare to ſuche forged and vaine tales and reportes, as are raiſed vpon thoſe vnſeene viſions of myne, and to praie to GOD for me, that it would pleaſe him to forgiue all my offences, and this offence eſpecially, whiche I committed of ſimple Ignoraunce, beeyng thereunto perſwaded, by ſuch a craftie and ſubtill ſeducer.
                     
                  
               
            
            Her ſpeeche beyng thus ended, Maiſter Bauyan the Maior of Cheſter inuicted Maiſter North, Maiſter Wyngfeeld, and my ſelf to goe home with hym to Dinner, where wee founde very worſhipfull entertainement, there dined likewiſe other Aldermen and Townes men of Cheſter, amongſt whō I enquired, what might be the meanyng why the yong Maiden had made this open proteſtation, I was aunſwered, that it was now almoſt two yeres paſt ſith ſhe had feined in Viſiō to ſee our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſte, with the Virgin Mary his Mother, S. Anne our Ladies Mother, Mary Magdalene, Sainct Ihon Babtiſt ſaiyng Maſſe, accompanied with the Apoſtles: and that ſhe had ſeen Purgatorie and been in Purgatorie, with many other like reuelations, the whiche ſhe either ſo cunnyngly counterfeited, or at the leaſt her beholders that were preſent duryng the tyme of her extaſies, were ſo credilous, or peraduenture willyng to haue furthered her in her purpoſe, that it was ſtreight waies imagined, by a multitude of dull headded Papiſtes in thoſe partes, that God had raiſed that little yong Propheteſe, to the greate glorie of their holie Father the Pope, and to the high aduauncement of their little

wheaten God: And although that ſith that tyme ſhe had paſſed the examinations of ſo Honorable as the Erle of Darby, and ſo reuerende as the Biſhoppe of Cheſter with ſundry others, yet ſhe ſtill ſtoutly ſtoode to her tacklyng, mainetaynyng her vnſeene reuelations to bee true, till now at the length by the admonitions of this good father Maiſter Goodman, ſhe was become penitent, confeſſed a truth, and in our preſentes, and that open aſſembly ſo diſcloſed and deteſted her errour as you haue heard.
            After this, I had inteligence of a Pamphelet that was ſecretly ſpread, wherein was deſcribed the maner of her Viſions, penned by ſome Archpapiſt that was aſhamed to put to his owne name, and yet of ſuche accoumpt amongſt our Catholikes in thoſe quarters, that it carieth better credite then either the Epiſtles of Sainct Paule, or the Goſpelles of the fower Euangeliſtes: and by the reportes of ſundrie credible perſonages, diuers Copies of it are ſent ouer the Sea as a precious preſent, ſome to Fraunce, ſome to Rome, but very many into Irelande.
            
            The Copie of this Pamphelet was giuen me by Maiſter Gondman, the whiche when I had ouerlooked, I founde in it ſuche profounde and deepe doctrine, as although before me in my yonger daies, I had ouer read the famous Hiſtories of Sir Beuis of Hampton, of Sir Guy of Warwicke, of the Frier and the Boy, of Howleglas, of Frier Ruſhe, and ſundrie other like, yet I dare boldly affirme, that this for matter and circumſtaunce doeth farre exceede and goe beyonde them all: yea, and nothyng put doune but might bee approued by good authoritie, and throughly confirmed by Legenda Aurea: Were it not pittie then that ſo worthie a worke as this, ſhould be ſtill thus ſmothered vp amongſt our Catholikes? the whiche queſtionles if it were publiſhed and brought to light, could not bee but accoumpted of, euen amongſt children and fooles.
            Receiue then with reuerence this precious peece of worke in due maner, as it was firſt penned by that greate Clarke Iohannes ſiue nomine, ſauyng that in the margent I haue

coated doune certaine principall poinctes worthie to be noted: willyng thee (freendly Reader) before thou aduenture to peruſe it, firſt to ſanctifie thy ſelf with Croſſynges and bleſſynges, it ſkilles not how fewe, Pater noſters in Latin the more the better, halfe a doſen of Creedes maie very well ſuffice, but as many Aue Maries as will fill a quarter Sacke, this doen, feare not then thou maiſt reade it at thy pleaſure: But if thou wilt vſe it to thy better auaile, reade it faſtyng, then make thy Dinner with a pound of Potato Rootes, and I warrant thee it ſhall make thée as holy as a poke full of the Popes pardons, and thus followeth the text.

                           An honourable thyng no doubt, to publiſhe lyes.
                           VNderſtanding by the teſtimony of Raphaell the Archangell, it is an honorable thing to publiſhe the workes of GOD, and readyng in the Monumentes of the auncient fathers, the holy Biſhoppes did vſe to declare vnto the people,What a multitude of Fathers he hath brought her for his incouragement, he hath named S Auguſtin who blamed a Gentlewoman, we can not tell wherfore. ſuche Viſions and Miracles as had happened amongſt them, whereof S. Auguſtine hymſelf ſo well liked, that he blamed greatly a noble Gentlewoman of his acquaintaunce for not reuealing the power of God ſhewed vppon her.
                        Wherefore, being incouraged by the holſome admonition of an Aungell, and examples of ſo many graue fathers of greate antiquitie, I am

                        My tyme is appoincted, I haue to remaine but a little ſpace with you, wherefore if I haue offended any of you all, as I knowe I haue doen, euen as you looke to obtaine forgiuenes of God for your owne ſinnes, I deſire you for his ſake to forgiue me (a miſerable ſinfull creature) thoſe thynges wherein I haue offended you. The whiche wordes beyng vttered with merueilous vehemencie, made all the companie that heard the ſame aſtonied: And when they had aunſwered we forgiue with al our hartes, ſhe aroſe and thanked them, wherevpon incontinētly turnyng from them, ſhe ſtared and fixed her eyes towards one place, as beholding ſome bodie, and ioynyng bothe handes in moſt reuerent

maner ſaied theſe wordes: Ieſu forgiue me, Ieſu forgiue me a ſinfull wretche, ſweete Ieſu forgiue me, wateryng her praiers with ſalte teares. Afterwardes pauſing a while and turning againe to the aſſiſtaunce, ſhe ſpake againe on this wiſe.
                        God hymſelf I thanke hym of his goodneſſe hath freely forgiuen me my ſinnes and wickedneſſe, I know it, I know it,A badde forgiueneſſe, if you marke the ſequell. for he hath ſo promiſed me, loe where he ſtandeth, beholde I ſee hym, let me goe to hym, let me imbrace hym, I ſee hym ſtand here before my face, accompanied with his holy Mother, beholde ſhe ſtandeth by hym, and ruſſhyng her ſelf with very greate ſtrength, offered towardes the place where ſhe ſaied Chriſt appeared vnto her, caſtyng both her armes abroade, as one readie to embrace, then ioynyng them againe to her bodie very faſt, ſhe ſaied: Now I haue hym, I haue hym in myne armes, O good Lord forgiue me, thou knoweſt what greate deſire I haue to come vnto thee, fy fy on this wretched worlde, here is no goodneſſe in it, I defy the worlde, I defy the world.
                        With theſe wordes and the like, ſhe mooued her audience to greate remorſe for their ſinnes, and admiration at the ſight, the rather, becauſe thei vnderſtood by her ſober wiſe aunſwers to all their demaundes, that ſhe had the perfecte vſe of her witte and memorie.
                        After this ſtaiyng her ſelf awhile, and beyng ſomewhat more quiete, the aſſiſtauntes hoped the fit was ended, but loe, beſides their expectation,

ſhe began againe to bee pittifully troubled, with intollerable paines, and to powre foorthe teares as before ſhe did, but yet more haboundantly, that thei ſeemed to droppe doune bothe her eyes bigger then Haileſtones, vtteryng moreouer theſe wordes with great vehemēcie.

ſhall appeare anone more plainely by her owne wordes to the holy Virgin: In the meane tyme let the Reader vnderſtande that her pardone was denaied, where at you ſhall haue no ſuche cauſe to maruaile, in beholdyng the Mother of mercie ſo harde to bee intreated,O wiſely conſidered. if you conſider that ſhe might committ ſome ſinne againſt the holie Virgine, that deſerued condigne puniſhement, although to ſaie the truthe vnfainedly, I beleeue that our bleſſed Ladie did therein more for her, then if ſhee had quite releaſed her paines, as thei can beſt teſtifie, who haue euer ſithence perceiued in her life wonderfull alteration.
                        But to returne againe where I left,A greate grace of God that it did not ſette the houſe on fire. the ſeelie wenche beholdyng this fire to drawe nerer and nerer, and fearing that ſhe could not eſcape it, at laſt yeelded her will to Gods determination, vtteryng theſe wordes to the Mother of Chriſt.
                        Well bleſſed Virgine Mary, ſince it is thy will (good Virgine) I ſhould enter into this fire, becauſe I can not haue forgiueneſſe at thy handes I muſt bee contented, and now I goe into it, Ieſu helpe me, Ieſu be mercifull vnto me, wherwt immediatly, ſhe made a ſhew, both by geſture of bodie & wordes, vttered in ſuche lamentable wiſe, that al the lookers on were fully perſwaded, this tender girle to indure vnſpeakeable tormētes, the ſpace of one houre and more, ſuſtainyng to their iudgementes,Or wiſemā able to beleue. greater panges then penne is able to write or tongue is able to

expreſſe, for it ſeemed more terrible then a womans paines in trauaile with Childe, or a man when the ſtitch teareth his bodie in peeces, and woundeth the harte to death: In ſo muche that the beholders wondered greatly, how her yong and tender fleſhe could indure the ſame, for ſhe burned within as well as without, that the heate broyled vp to her mouthe,This fire is more hot then the ſcorching flames of Loue. and her ſkinne ſcorched with ſuche exceſſiue heate, that hardly could any man abide to touche her to be briefe, for very paine her eyes were couered with a miſt, and her mouthe fomed, that all the companie aſſiſtauntes diſpaired of her life, and were fore greeued to ſee ſo heauie a ſpectacle, and to heare ſo pittifull a voyce pearcyng their eares, oh, oh, oh, O good Lorde I burne, good Lorde I burne.
                        The reſt of her words were ſuch as became the ſeruaūt of God, neuer ceaſing, whileſt her bodie laie in the fire, to occupy her tongue wt praiſing God, and calling vpon his holie name, for helpe and eaſe of her paine, vtterly defiyng the whole worlde, withall the vanities thereof, ſinne, and all ſinfull meanes: To conclude, beyng come at the laſt to an ende of her puniſhment, and feeling her poore body vnable to indure the paine, ſhe ſaied: oh that I had one droppe of water to coole this cruell burnyng heate wherein I am, Lorde,
                              Aqua vitae, a precious ointment againſt the fire of Purgatorie. Lorde, if it bee thy will ſende it me: and forth with one of the ſtanders by, ſpilt vpon her a little Aqua vitae, wherevpon in their conceipte, the burning ſlaked ſomwhat, for ſhe ſaid, Lord

I thanke thee now ſome of the greate heate is cooled, I thanke thee good Lorde.
                        Finally, beeyng throughly releaſed from all her paines, ſhe called often vpon a yong Mayd named Alco Ioua, who had been buried the ſame daie, and ſtretching her arme from her, as if ſhe tooke her by the hande, criyng earneſtly vppon her to ſtaie till ſhe was readie, for ſhe would come with her: and this is the effect of her wordes and behauiour during the firſt extaſie, that thei could beare awaie who were neareſt vnto her as I learned out of their mouthes by ſeuerall examinations: Muche more then is here written ſhe ſaied, and did as deuoutly as harte could wiſhe, but their wittes were ſo rauiſhed to behold ſuche a lamētable ſight, that thei had no mynd nor leiſure to marke euery thing particulerly. Neuertheleſſe, by this that is ſpoken,He that will not credite this tale, it were pittie but he ſhould want a merie tale. I hope the deuoute Reader ſhal finde ſufficient inſtruction to credit the Viſion, that dependeth wholy vpon the girles reporte in order as followeth.
                        After all her troubles nowe ended, and the Viſion now vaniſhed, ſome of the companie did conueie her to bed, where ſhe had a ſhorte ſlumber very vnquiete, and loe this while her ſences were ſo taken, that to their iudgements ſhe lay ſtarke dead, but being at the length awaked, ſhe did complaine that all the ioyntes of her bodie were ſo weary, as if thei had been ſtretched out of the Racke.
                        About this tyme, her Stepmother began to

examine her what ſhe had ſeene and heard, but ſhe deſired reſpite, becauſe of her wearineſſe, whereof her ſaied Mother beyng ill apaied, expected better opertunitie, and within fiue houres after, vnderſtandyng the girle to be in very good moode, ſhe brought with her certaine of the companie, that had beene preſent, who demaunded forthwith whither ſhe did remember her talke to them the night before, whoſe aunſwere was, that ſhe neither remembred them to be in place, nor any communication betwene her and them, wherewith thei were not a little amaſed, hauyng alſo knowne her to be in very perfecte health and brode wakyng all the ſaied while, therefore perſwading thē ſelues, that ſhe could not indure thoſe troubles without ſome ſtraunge alteration of mynde, thei exhorted her earneſtly to open what ſhe had ſeen and heard, wherewith ſhe ſpake as followeth.

ſhe ſaied with very great vehemencie, O Lord, he reacheth his hande towardes me, let me goe to hym, let me imbrace hym, wherewith immediatly by meare force in diſpite of them all, ſhe roſe vpon her feete, and ſpreadyng bothe armes ſhe ioyned them againe faſt to her ſtomacke, vtteryng theſe wordes: I haue haue hym now in armes, O good Lord I haue thee, Ieſus help me, leaue me not ſweete Ieſus leaue mee not: neuer ceaſyng to call vpon his holie name. But one of the aſſiſtauntes beeyng wearie to heare the often repetition of Ieſus, of Chriſte, and of our Ladie, deſirous to put her to ſilence, ſaied vnto her: cō

And hauyng no ſoner ended her talke, there came vppon her a merueilous greate terrour and feare, whereof inſued tremblyng of her bodie, pantyng of her harte, woorkyng of her vaines, fomyng at her mouthe, fallyng grouelyng on her bed for paine, ſtruglyng, and criyng out moſt pitifully, defiyng ye worlde,

and all ſinfull creatures therein (for ſo ſhe termed them) and callyng without intermiſſion vpon the holy name of Ieſus, to be deliuered from all paines, whiche laſted two houres long, moſt ruthfull to the beholders, and nothyng inferior to her former puniſhment whē ſhe laie in Purgatorie: and this (as I ſuppoſe) chaunced, for feare ſhe ſhould feele againe the foreſaied torment, being (as it is euident by her owne ſpeech in their hearing) already repreſented before her eyes, for ſhe called often Ales Ioua, and Miſtris Conway her Grandmother, at length ſhe was admoniſhed in her Viſion, to procure that S. Ihons Goſpell written by a Prieſt, might bee tyed about her necke: Whereof beyng very deſirous, one of the aſſiſtantes offered her the Goſpell in writyng, whiche ſhe repelled quickly as made by hym, whom ſhe knewe to bee a ſinfull man, and conſideryng no lawfull Prieſt was to bee had,Prieſtes bee no ſinfull menne. ſhe called importunatly for the Miniſter of Orton, but the meſſenger loitered and went not: whereof ſhe informed the aſſiſtauntes, deſiring them in all haſte to ſende for hym, but one of the companie replied againe, and confirmed it with an othe, that the meſſenger had gone, whom bitterly ſhe rebuked, and ſharpely admoniſhed, that he had ſworne falſly, that whiche in deede after diligent inquiſition, was found to be true. And now the ſaied Miniſter beyng come, he offered her the foreſaid written Goſpell, two ſundrie tymes, perſwadyng the ſame to bee his owne doyng, the whiche ſhe refuſed, and witted

hym to take the paines hym ſelf, for ſhe knewe well he did but delude her: at the laſt, reachyng the Goſpell of his owne hande written; ſhe accepted it thankfully, and the ſigne of the Croſſe beeyng made by her appoinctment in the ende thereof, it was tied faſt aboute her necke, and the ſame foulded croſwiſe by her appointment: wherevpon ſhe had preſently better reſt as thei ſuppoſed.
                        Beyng demaunded, why ſhe deſired the Miniſters helpe, her anſwer was, that This could not bee true, for bothe Chriſte and Sainct Ihon Baptiſt ſtode by, and thei were bothe Prieſtes, or els the Pope would neuer haue ſuffered them to haue ſaied Maſſe, now Chriſte was the firſt that euerſaid Maſſe on Maundie Thurſdaie, when he ſaid hoc eſt corpus meum, & Sainct Ihō Baptiſt ſong maſſe, as you ſhal perceiue by ye whiche followeth preſently. although he was a Miniſter, yet beyng in hart a Catholike, ſhe tooke him to be more fit then any other that were aboute her, and hoped that GOD would not bee offended, knowing her preſent neceſſitie and want of a lawfull Prieſt.
                        Here I would wiſhe the Catholike Reader to vnderſtande, that Sainct Ihons Goſpell maie be lawfully vſed, by the learned iudgement of the famous Ieſuit Father Robertes: But whereas Gods holie ſpirite ſtirred the girle in all haſte to ſende for this miniſter, it is to be referred to his ſecret diſpenſation, whoſe good will & pleaſure was (as it ſeemed) to haue him in place, that he might alſo beare witneſſe to the truthe againſt him ſelf and his owne profeſſion, accordyng to the teſtimonie of our Sauiour Chriſte: Ex ore tuo, te iudicabo ſerue iniquam: O naughtie ſeruaunt, I will iudge thee out of thyne owne mouthe. Immediatly after, ſhe vttered many wordes in his hearyng to the deteſtation of the This ſame Proteſtants Religiō hath ſo diſplaced our holy Father, that the deuil himſelf will neuer be able to ſalue ye ſore again. Proteſtauntes Religion and Seruice, as hereafter

followeth: the whiche truely at that inſtant did worke in his harte greate remorſe.
                        Aboute this tyme, one of the companie reached to her a little Crucifixe,
                           You maie perceiue by this, that there was good cōpany. the whiche ſhe receiued with very great reuerence, and cauſed it to be laied in her boſome, taking occaſion thereby, to call vpon Chriſt crucified, whom the picture preſented, crauyng ſtill for mercie and forgiueneſſe: but what neede I (ſaied ſhe) to haue the Picture of Chriſte, when I ſee hym preſent before myne eyes, and poincted her finger towardes hym.
                        Then ſhe fell to exclaime againſt the Religiō of the Proteſtauntes, and diſpiſing it wonderfully vttered theſe wordes: Fie vpon this wretched worlde, and fie vppon the naughtie Religion now vſed, fie vppon their wicked and accurſed Churche, moſte abhominable in Gods ſight: I will neuer enter into it as long as I liue, to heare their accurſed Seruice, vnleſſe I be caried thether by force: O that you did now beholde the difference that I ſee betwene both.This is like to bee true, you might perceiue that one of them had a crucifixe ſo ready.
                        
                        With theſe wordes and the like, ſhe wearied the eares of the hearers, as beyng (in deede) thē ſelues of the ſame Religion, that the holy Ghoſt through her mouthe accompted damnable and accurſed.
                        Thus I haue declared the effecte of her doynges and ſaiynges, during the ſecond extaſie, as nere as I could carie the fame awaie, by the relation of thoſe that were aboute her all the ſaied tyme: And now remaineth herIf the Viſion contain as good matter as this that is paſt, tis worthie the hearyng.

                           This honeſt companie he might haue ſaied.The aſſiſtauntes whom our Lorde did eſpecially elect to bee witneſſes of this ſtraunge miracle, gatheryng by her wordes and behauiour, that ſhe had now ſeene and heard greater miſteries, then in her former Viſion. Therefore,For feare it ſhould haue been forgotten, and what pitie had that been. beyng not able to content them ſelues any longer, the next daie after, earneſtly deſired to heare the truthe of the laſt extaſie, as thei had heard of the firſt, to whoſe expectation as duetie required condeſcending, ſhe vttered the ſame after this maner and forme.
                        Yeſternight ſtandyng by the fire in the olde Hall (as you knowe) amongſt the reſt of our family, there appeared vnto me a goodly old man all in white, who after he had made twoo or three turnynges before my face, returned to the newe Parler,The old mā went out of the olde Hall into the newe Parlour. from whence he was come as we thought, whither alſo I followed hym to ſee what he did, but miſſing him there, I made haſt towardes the vpper Chamber, where I hoped to finde him, and loe ſodainely no ſmall number of Waxe Candles burned in my fight, whereat gazing with greate admiration (for that I had neuer ſeene the like before) & perceiued the foreſaied old Here you maie ſee the wiſedome of God, to ſend an old man of his arrāde for had it bin a yong man, it had been ſomwhat ſuſpicious, but thei had good ſtore of candell light, yt was the beſt. man him ſelf againe approched nere me, I was afraied: but he comforted me ſaiyng, bee not afraied, for here is none will dooe thee hurte: then pauſing a little he ſaied moreouer, art thou contented to doe after me: I aunſwered

that I would gladly dooe after hym if he came from God, I am (ſaied he) doubt nothing: Wherevppon I wilde hym to tell his meſſage, wherefore with very familier ſpeeche, he admoniſhed me of my nature, muche inclined to vice, bodie ſubiect to greate troubles and daungers, whereof I ſhould feele ſhortly the effecte, if I would not preuent the ſame in due tyme: therefore he exhorted me to faſt and praie, whereby he ſaied I ſhould ouercome my euill deſtinie.
                        As he thus communed with me, beholde I did ſee our Sauiour Chriſt and his Apoſtles after him, accompanied with the bleſſed Virgine Mary, Sainct Anne the holie Virgines Mother, and Mary Magdalene: Wherewith the audience interrupting her talke, examined the Maide of their habit and formes: who tolde them that Chriſt and Sainct Anne did weare Purple roabes, our Ladie Scarlet, all the reſt white garmentes doune to the grounde,It ſhould ſeeme he had come lately from the Barbers. our Sauiours bearde ſomewhat ſhorte, & the heires of his hed thinne, and bothe in colour very blacke, the heire of his holie Mothers heade was Abraham colour, hangyng doune her ſhoulders moſte decently, her face ſhined brighter then any Chriſtall, her voyce amiable beyond meaſure: but her bleſſed Sonnes countenaunce ſhe could not diſcribe, becauſe of the lightneſſe therof, for her eyes dazled to behold his Roabes,It ſhould ſeme his roabes were of Purple in Gr

                           Mary Magdalene ſhe marked not, ſauyng that ſhe rembreth certaine white places in her head, by pluckyng the heires for ſorrowe, cariyng in her hande a peuter bottle full (as it ſeemed) of ſome Belike twas Aqua vitae for ſome of her frendes that were in Purgatorie. liquour. Muche ſhe rehearſed of the Apoſtles perticulerly, the whiche I haue omitted here to auoide tediouſneſſe. And ſo hauyng ſatiſfied their requeſts, ſhe returned to her former talke, as hereafter followeth.
                        As ſoone as this heauenly quire had preſented them ſelues before me, I began forthwith to feare that thei might be ſome wicked Sprites or Goblines: wherevpon Chriſte ſtepped towardes the place where I ſtoode, and reached me his hande to bee felt, the whiche I did handle as the hande of any other man, where withall he ſpake theſe wordes.

                        After this, my guide (whom I ſuppoſed to haue been Sainct Ihon the Babtiſt) laboured muche to reconcile me vnto Chriſte, the whiche he ſaied might not be, vnleſſe I would reconcile my ſelf vnto his Church, and continue in a right faith: for he certified me that I was blindely led, and lacked the true knowledge of his holie will, often repeatyng that I beleued amiſſe: At length beeyng not able to auoide his importunitie, I demaunded whither I muſte beleeue as my

neighbours doe, meaning the Catholikes, who abſent themſelues from the new Seruice now vſed: Euen ſo ſaied he, beleeue as thei dooe, and abſent thy ſelf alſo from that wicked Seruice if thou wilt bee ſaued: Whereat I ſtaied a long tyme, and ſeemed as one very loath to yeeld, for caſtyng in my mynde the daungers and troubles that might inſue thereof. In the meane ſpace he trauailed muche betweene Chriſt and me, perſwadyng ſtill in his name to promiſe amendment.
                        But vnderſtandyng that his perſwaſions could take no place, he repreſented before myne eyes the fire of Purgatorie, & threatned ſharply to plundge me therein if I would not relent: the ſight whereof ſo frited me, that I yeelded to forgo the Church, as I would haue doen gladly to abide any worldly torment, rather then I ſhould be laied againe in that burning furnate:Clapt handes, and ſo twas a bargaine. and ioynyng my hande to his, I confirmed the former promiſe, the whiche I meane by Gods grace to parforme, for any puniſhment in this worlde, becauſe I can not feele greater, then alreadie I haue ſuffered in Purgatorie:Ye maie perceiue ye wēche though ſhe was yong, yet ſhe had wit to make her bargaine And withall I added, vnleſſe I bee brought thether by maine force: wherewith he replied, that they are blameleſſe who be forſed, and their compellers aunſwerable for the fact. To conclude, after many words he commended vnto me Beades hallowed, as of ſinguler vertue to praie withall, and farre exceeding the Beades vnhalowede Muche more talke he had with me that

I haue vtterly forgotten, but in the ende findyng me very tractable, he commended me vnto a Catholike Prieſt by name, demaundyng whither I knewe ſuche a one (this Prieſt had been at that inſtant in the Pariſhe Church adioynyng, openly proclaimed for a ſedicious perſon and ſeducer of the people) my aunſwer was that I knewe hym not, whereat he ſeemed to be angrie, chargyng me that I vttered an vntruthe, for I had ſeen him twice (the whiche indeede ſit hence I remēber well) and commaundyng to ſearche for hym amongſt the Apoſtles, whom diligently peruſing, I ſaid that I could not finde hym: wherevpon he replied, then thou knoweſt hym well, learne of hym what to beleue, his counſaile if thou followe thou ſhalte be ſaued:It ſhould ſeme he was ſome of our Ladies chaplines, that ſhe vndertoke ſo much for his honeſtie.

               TEll me now (freendly Reader) is not this pretie ſtuffe to bee made ſo muche accompte of, muſt not this Religion bee profounde, that is propte vp with ſuche Pillers as this, and yet thou ſeeſt that the greateſt fortification of our

holie Fathers doctrine, conſiſteth in Dreames, olde Wiues tales, Vnknowwen ſcriptures, Traditions of menne, ſtraunge Miracles, Fables, and Follies.
            Truely our countrey is to be lamented, in whiche the Goſpell hauyng raigned long, and Religion floriſhed ſo many yeres, yet Superſtition preuaileth ſo muche, that thei be readie to bee leade awaie with ſuche euident ſhewes of follie, that vnleſſe their eyes were bleared with too muche impudencie, it were not poſſible thei ſhould bee ſo deceiued. But what Aſſe but would haue been aſhamed to haue penned doune ſo ridiculous a matter, vnder ſuche a ſhewe of veritie, but that he knew emongeſt whom to ſende it: For truely the fooliſhe credulitie of the ſimpleſt ſorte of our ignorant Papiſtes is ſuche, that tell them a tale of a Maſſe, Purgatorie, of holie Water, of the ſigne of the Croſſe, or of any other ſuche like vanitie: and thei are ſtreght leade in beleef of ſuche thynges, to bee more then deuine, that (in deede) doe moſte deſerue to bee laught at. You maie ſee thei are driuen to a bare ſhifte, that (for want of better matter) would foiſte in a Religion with ſuche traſhe as this, but vnhappie thei that are ſo blinded in errour, that thei ſhould not bee able to deſcerne vanitie from veritie: And this is the cauſe why thei reſtraine the Laietie, from the readyng of the Scripture, for otherwiſe it were not poſſible, that ſuche Fables could bee ſo preciouſly accoumpted of: And this is the cauſe that I haue laied open theſe Viſions, to the vewe of the worlde, that thoſe that bee wiſe might laugh, at the doltiſhe deuiſes of our ſeducyng Papiſtes, who vnder a ſhewe of learnyng, deceiues the ſimple ſore with ſuche manifeſt vntruthes. But yet to lament the weakeneſſe of thoſe that be ignoraunt, who bee ſtill readie to entertaine ſuche trifles, as deuine and heauenly miſteries, to feede them in their farther follies.
            But I muſt needes blame our aucthour, what ſo euer he was, who (as it ſeemeth) hauyng been long tyme ſchooled in the liyng Legend of Antechriſt, hath yet forgotten the cheefeſt axioma that longes to his profeſſion, whiche is, oportet mendatem eſſe memorem, who lies muſt bee carefull to remember,

for in knittyng vp his Viſions, where he would haue made greateſt ſhewe of veritie, euen there he laies in ſight moſte manifeſt vntruthes: whiche I will not toucht in particularities, for that thei bee freuilous, yet will I note them in generall, for that thei bee odious, and deſerues no better aunſwere, then a ſcoffe or a mocke.
            His exordium taken from the ſanctified Archaungell Raphaell might well haue ſtande, if his cauſe had been iuſte, but now it is confeſſed, that all theſe Miracles were but fantaſies, and the Propheteſſe in her Patheticall extaſies, but a ſillie Maiden, ſeduced by a runnegate Papiſt, as now it is proued: And the matter it ſelf if it bee wiſely marked, is enterlarded with contrarietie of vntruthes: in one place ſhe could diſcribe the roabes whiche Chriſte ſhould weare, to bee of Purple colour, and preſently ſhe feineth them to bee more brighter then the beames of the Sunne: and although ſhe knewe Chriſte, with his mother the Virgine Marie, his Graunde mother Sainct Anne, with Marie Magdalene, and Sainct Ihon the Baptiſt, euen at the firſt ſight, bothe of her firſt and laſte Viſions, yet when Saincte Ihon ſhould come to ſaie his Maſſe, ſhe was afraied of them, and tooke them to bee Goblins, till Chriſt had giuen her his hande to bee felt.
            The aſſiſtauntes ſo many tymes ſpoken of, our aucthour would perſwade thei were Proteſtauntes, and therefore wearied with her exclamations againſt Religion now vſed, yet who would beleeue any woorde to bee true, when one of them had a Crucifixe ſo readie to preſent, and the reſte was ſo fooliſhe to ſuffer her to take it. The Apoſtles when ſhe coumpted them, ſhe ſaieth were iuſte eleuen, I wonder where the twelfe was, or who it was that was miſſyng, but it might bee that this Viſion was reuealed before Mathias was choſen in Iudas roome, or els it was Sainct Peter that was miſſyng, for he is Porter in heauen, and therefore could not bee ſpared out of his office, and I thinke if he had been there, he had been a fitter man to haue ſaied Maſſe, then Saincte Ihon, for that he hymſelf was oure Pope, and therefore ſhould haue ſo muche

the better experience.
            Thus thou maieſt ſee (gentle reader) that varietie, and impoſſibilitie are the twoo beſt ſt
                  •
               ynges that our aucthour hath to his bowe, who findyng no other meanes to maintaine his vncertainties, thinketh vnder diſſeblyng vntruthes, to drawe the ſimplicitie of the common ſorte, from the truthe and right Religion.
            But admitte that theſe feigned Viſions had been ſenciblie ſeen, and that ſome apparaunce had been made of theſe ſurmiſed Reuelations, ſhould wee therevppon ſtraight waies eſtabliſhe a Religion, without any further examination, how thei might ſtande with the will of God. Our learned Fathers lead by the ſpirite of Wiſedome, when thei heard of ſuche Viſions or Reuelations, thei brought them ſtraight to the toucheſtone comparyng them to the holie Scriptures, if thei founde them ſuche as tended to the glorie of God, thei admitted them for good, if otherwiſe miſleadyng to ignoraunce and errour, thei condemned them as illuſions ſent by the Deuill. But is there any thyng more repugnaunte to Chriſtian beleef, then that God is not ſufficient to forgiue vs our ſinnes, but wee muſte haue a quittaunce ſealed from our Ladie, and ſhe that was wont to bee called our Ladie of Pitie, is now become a gentilwoman of too muche crueltie. But our aucthour verie wiſely excuſyng the matter, thinkes there was ſome ſinne, that was committed againſt her ſelf, and though that bothe her ſoonne Chriſt and ſhe had forgiuen all the reſte, yet ſhe might not forgiue that. And beleeue me this maie well bee true, for the Pope hymſelf is of the ſame condition, for he hath Pardons for hym that will kill his father, for hym that ſhould commit inceſtious fornication with his mother, for hym that ſhould bee a rebell to his Prince, a traitour to his Countrey, to be ſhort, Treaſon, Murther, Robberie, Adultrie, Bauderie, Buggerie: and what not but our holie Father will forgiue you, ſo you doe not touche hymſelf, nor none of his broode: but the leaſte offence that maie bee committed againſt any of theſe, though God and our Ladie bothe would forgiue ye, yet I can tell you

the Pope will neuer doe it. But what a pretie wipe hath our aucthour giuen here to our holie fathers Bulles, who ye Deuill will make any accoumpte of them now hereafter this, for the Pope though he bee Chriſtes Vicar, yet he is none of our Ladies, and though he maie diſpence with matters in controuerſie betweene vs and God, yet he hath nothyng adoe betweene vs and our Ladie, vnleſſe it bee by the waie of intreatie, and our Ladie I perceiue when ſhe is angred, hath a womans ſtomacke, ſhe will not eaſily bee pacified, and then there is no ſhift but you muſt to Purgatorie, for Chriſtes forgiueſſe will doe you no good, and the Pope can pardō no more, then Chriſt is able to forgiue: And therefore I perceiue the Prouerbe to bee true, the houſe is too vnquiet where the good wife weares the breeches, and yet you ſee it is ſo in heauen.
            When Marie Magdalen went to the Sepulchre with teares to ſeeke Chriſte, to whom although he firſte ſhewed hym ſelf, yet ſhe might not ſo muche as once to touche hym, yet our yonge Propheteſſe, who as our aucthour affirmeth was ignoraunt, an heretique, one that was ſeuered from the Popes Churche, and therefore by their owne Canons and Generall Counſailes condemned, not worthie to touche any of their holie reliques, and yet ſhe might bee ſuffered to imbrace Chriſte in her armes.
            The matter that our Author by theſe Viſions would faineſt induce you vnto, conſiſteth eſpecially in theſe three pointes. Firſt he would bryng you in good likyng of their bleſſed Maſſe. Seconde, he would make you afearde of their dreadfull Purgatorie: And laſtly, it greeues hym to the harte that any bodie ſhould goe to Churche to heare the worde of God: for if thei could once barre vs from readyng the Scriptures, all the paine were paſt, all the reſt would be eaſily brought to a good paſſe.
            Now, firſt for the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, who doubteth (vnleſſe directly blinded) but thei muſt reſolutely conclude, that our forefathers, Adam, Lot, Noe, Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, with the reſt are ſtopped from the fruition of Heauen, in that

thei could not be partakers of the Reall reception of the Sacrament, vnleſſe it were through faith in beleuyng and ſpirituall feedyng, by the whiche we are likewiſe made partakers all of one bodie, and all through one faith.
            For Purgatorie, if it growe by the multiplication of our ſinnes, either in exceſſe or defecte, what ſhall wee imagine of the Theefe on the Croſſe, who by Chriſtes owne wordes was aſſured this: To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradice: He neuer ſpoke word of Purgatorie. Or what of Mary Magdalene, whoſe ſynnes were freely forgiuen her by Chriſte, without goyng to Purgatorie. And what of the poore Publicane, that acknowledged hym ſelf a miſerable ſinner, and yet was iuſtified by Chriſte. Or who now hence forwarde will giue any credite to Sainct Paule, who writyng to the Hebrewes 9. ſaieth: There is no remiſſion of ſynnes without bloud. When our Catholikes makyng hym a manifeſt lyer, hath founde a waie to ſalue all ſores through the fire of Purgatorie.
            But be that would bee better confirmed in this poinct, let hym reade Ihon Frith againſt the Biſhoppe of Rocheſter: ſir Thomas Moore, and Ihon Raſtell, where thei ſhall finde this phantaſticall Purgatorie ſo vndermined, that no Papiſt but might be aſhamed once to make mention of it.
            Now laſtly as before I haue ſaied: the Pope is very vnwillyng that the Scripture ſhould bee in a knowne language amongſt vs: but in the ſteede of them, he hath bequeathed vs Legenda Aurea, the life of Chriſt, written by a fift Euaungeliſt, named Bonauentura: We haue likewiſe their Feſtiuall, with ſuche other ſtuffe. Theſe we maie reade in Engliſh, you maie eaſily geſſe why, but the Scriptures we muſt not heare but in Latin, becauſe thei ſaie it is daungerous that we ſhould reade the Scripture in a knowne language: ſo that the right conſtruction of this ſentence, Beati qui audiunt verbum dei & coſtodiunt ipſam, after the interpretation of our holie Father, maie thus be vnderſtoode: Bleſſed are thei whiche heare the worde of God and knowes not what it meaneth. Theſe

matters haue been by many men ſo Clarckly diſcourſed, and of ſo long a tyme ſo learnedly confuted, and therefore by me lightly ouerpaſſed: I dooe but onely ayme at the intent and wiſhe the wiſeſt to laugh at the errour.
            Thus (gentle Readers) you ſee the courſe of theſe vnnaturall Antichriſtians, who when thei finde no one waie, to maintaine their vngodly opinions, ſeeke by ſequeſter dealinges to oppreſſe the truthe. But diſſimulation is eſpied by his contrary, and truthe ſpeaketh in no corners: Religiō that is in it ſelf perfect, requireth no fabulous miracles to confirme it: but where vanitie is workemiſtris, then all thynges are confirmed with ſhadowes.
            Truely it ſeemeth ſtraunge vnto me, that either blinded errour ſhould ſeduce vs ſo ſarre, or ſuppoſitions of good meaning blind vs ſo greatly, where the good work is ſo freuilous.
            Let not the God of this world ſo muche bleare your eyes, be not led awaie with euery blaſt of reporte: Symon Magus, though he be his craftes maiſter, he is yet found out by a profeſſed Apoſtle: and the vngracious practiſes, and Ceremonious intentes, of our fooliſhe Maſmongers are proued friuelous, beyng looked into by the true Religion. O call your ſelues home, and remember from whence you are fallen, be not ſeduced by falſe Gods, to forſake the true Lambe, that ſacrificed for you.
            God is truthe, and he that worſhippeth hym muſt worſhippe hym in ſpirite and truthe. Let not phantaſies miſgouerne you, let not your hartes be hardned againſt holſome admonitions.
            Arme your ſelues with the readyng of the worde of God, ſo then charme the Charmer neuer ſo wiſely, he ſhall not yet be able is compaſſe you.
            Peruſe the olde Fathers, examine the holie Scriptures, conferre indifferently bothe literall and ſubſtanciall interpretations, and you ſhall finde that Antichriſt the Pope, doth but diſſemble with you, and that all his allegations, are but falſifications. The poore Publicant ſhall be iuſtified, and the proud

Phariſie ſhall be condemned: Not he that crieth Lorde Lord, but he that doeth the will of the Father. Muche babblyng makes not Religion, nor burning Tapers zelous Oriſons: But that Lorde that knoweth the harte and raines, reueileth his wiſedome to Infantes, and confoundeth the wiſeſt in their owne ouerwenynges.
            The practiſes that of late daies haue beene brought into this Realme, might confirme our Papiſtes neither to bee zelous nor honeſt. Did not Campion ſell Pardons to imploye his money againſt her Maieſtie? did not thei of that confederacie, ſell the death of her highneſſe with the cheefeſt Pillers of the ſtate. But the Lorde preſerued Elizabeth to the comforte of all true Engliſhe myndes, and iniquitie is falne into the pitfall, that he hath prepared for other.
            And here I muſt ſomethyng expoſtulate with ſome our hollowe harted ſubiectes, how thei can without bluſhyng, pronounce that thei loue her Maieſtie, when thei daiely entertaine thoſe Ieſuites whiche ſeeke her deſtruction.
            How maie wee accoumpt them ſubiectes, when thei reiecte lawes: or men of religious conſcience, when in their demeanours thei are ſo traiterous.
            My freendes, turne awaie your face from leaſinges, deſire the Lorde to deliuer you from liyng lippes and a deceiptfull tongue, and he will make you ſpectacles of his mercie.
            Let not forlorne hope miſleade you, or fained miracles withdraw you, nor olde wiues propheſies ſo miſgouerne you, but with all ſubmiſſiō acknowledge gracious Elizabeth your ſoueraigne Queene, who as you are malefactors can and wil puniſhe you, ſo in your humble and hartie ſubmiſſion, no doubt ſhe will receiue you to mercie. The Lorde increaſe her Maieſties raigne, preſerue her Counſaile, continue Religion in the zelous ſubiectes, and graunt amendement to the abſtinat Papiſtes. Amen.
            FINIS.
