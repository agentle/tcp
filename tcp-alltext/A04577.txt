               Essay. 1. OF GREATnes of mind.
            
               GReatenes of Minde is an ornament to vertue, setting it forth in an higher degree of excellency, teaching vs to contemne all these imaginate worldly greatnesses, and confirming vs with a puissant resolution to enter vppon the bracest enterprises: where this aptnesse is wanting, the vertues which specially befitte great fortunes (as depth of wisedome,

height of courage and liberality) are also wanting, and it is as impossible to enlarge a little minde to any of these vertues, as with the puffe of the mouth to force a tall vessell against a strong and deepe streame.
            For how can they bee carried to embrace worthy deedes, who so highly prize this interim of life, how can they bee wise, who distracted with vaine feares, doe not settle in this resolution, that all worldly happinesse hath his being onely by opinion▪ how can they be liberal, whose mindes confined to the world, think of liuing continually?
            Contrariwise, where learning hath gotten such a disposition to worke vppon, it is most powerfull, and can plant an opinion against the strongest feare of death. Then a man is easily induced not to esteeme the giftes of Fortune for their specious shew (for that were to admire them) but for their vse, and that is to gouerne them. 
                  •

               gnifying note of subiection, arguing a defect with acknowledgement of a better. And indeede greate minds cannot endure to make shew of a beholdingnes They loue their own benefites, and it is better by cō
               memoration of former fauoures to drawe them to accomplish our desires, then by mentioning those good good turns, which proceeding from vs to them, might in reason binde a granting our petitions: for by so doing they thinke Destrui fortunam suā
                and interprete it to a diminution of their greatnes, and disabling them of abilitie to requite: and when the benefites are greater then hope of recompence, in lieu of a gratefull acceptance, they are repayed with a most malitious ill will▪ for there is no worse & more dangerous hatred then the shame and inward guilt of an abused benefite
            With those men the most preuailing

manner of intercession is to giue thankes, as in Traians time the best Phrase of suting for offices was to shew that hee had beene lately indowed with one: Optimé magistratus magistratu, honore honos peritur.
            
            These mindes with a noble despisingnes, ouerpassing small matters, contend for an excesse of estimation reseruing and husbanding their prowesse for the greatest employmentes, AEnaeas in the Poet.
            
               -solum densa in caligine Turnū Vestigat lustrans: Solum in certamina poscit.
            
            Neyther can I more fitly compare them, then to those noble dogs; which presented to Alexander by the king of Albanie, would not stirre at small beastes, but with an ouerflowing of courage contemned to incounter but with Lyons and Elephantes.
            They are spare in speech, open in action, euer musing and retired, such as Scipio is described by Cicero,
               
and Sylla (by the most cunning searcher of mens minds) Salust in whom hee sayeth: there was an incredible height of spirite in concealing his courses. They are neyther proudly conceited in prosperity, nor discouraged with the stormes of aduersity, no way impeachable or subiected to the base dominion of Fortune. Such was Furius Camillus, who being alway like himselfe, neyther by attaining the Dictatorship, was enflamed to haughtines, nor by being forbidden his countrie, was strooken into melancholie: and surelie in this vertue the Romains were generally admirable, who neither in their conquering age were puffed vp to insolēcy, nor in their crosse & vnlooked for accidentes stooped to dispaire. As in the disaster at Cannae, (when all the worlde did ring out peales, that their fortunes were dead) they did nothing vnworthy themselues, that might bee a derogation to the auncient dignity of their name: for being driuen to that exigent, that

hauing lost the flower and strength of their nations, they armed their seruantes and aged men to the battell, yet they neuer offered any capitulations for a truce, neyther wold they redeeme their captiues, both which actions imported an inuincible confidence: and afterward in the enterprise of Asia, they proposed before the victorie conditions to Antiochus, as i
                  •
                they had ouercome, and after the conquest out of a wonderful moderation, as if they had not vanquished.
            But little mindes hauing risen with a prosperous winde, are lifted vppe farre beyond the leuell of their owne discourse: Then they beginne to speake in a commaunding accent to condemne other mens actions, to affect singularitie, to vsurpe vndue authorities, to contrauert in argument without respect, and to perseuere with an vnflexible stubbornnes, perswaded that al things becom them, and thus drunken with vaine greatnes, founded vppon no worthinesse

are easilie trayned into opinion, that their state was atchieued by their vertue, and that their vertue was worthy of a better state. But when they beginne to taste any disfauour, presently discountenanced in themselues, they are eyther by seldome comfortlesse flatterers, brought to some vnreasonable purpose (as Claudius blinded with the false informatiōs of Pallas to adopt Nero) or else hauing no greatnes but outwarde, and standing on no true ground inwardly, are more ready to fall then calamity can depresse them, and presentlie like vile and abiect creatures, not aduenturing to recouer, dispaire of renuing, and reintegrating their fortunes.
            But as the best wine becommeth the egrest vinegar, and what degree of goodnesse a thing holdeth while it abideth in his nature, the same degree of euill it taketh, when it is abused: So this greatnesse of mind, if it be not accompanied with vertue, maketh men daungerouslie

bad & terrible, producing the same effectes, which it did in Catiline, Immoderata, incredibilia, nimis alta sē
                  per cupiendo: but being guided by clearenesse of iudgement, causeth men to bee soly earnest for the publique good, not to bee contentious, self-seeking, or any thing respecting their peculiar aduantages.
         
         
            Essay. 2, Of Wit.
            MEN of slowe capacitie, are more apte to serue, then to rule, their conceite is so tough, that neither the rules of learning, nor precepts of wisedome▪ nor habite of vertue can make any impression.

               Tardis mentibus virtus nō committitur, sayeth Cicero. They haue a dulnes enemie to wisedom, a slownes hurtfull to the moments of occasion, a certaine vnderstanding alwaye f
                  •
               aught with suspition, the lesse they perceiue, the more they conceiue, (for the selfe-guiltines of their owne defectes makes them willing to appeare curious) rather following chance, then doing any thing vpon free election: they faile in that greatnes of minde, that noblenes in their ends, that reason to resolue, that spirite to execute, that feeling of disgraces, which a man ought to haue.
            Some in the choice of Ministers, elect men of this disposition, contemptu magis, quam gratia, who stand so farre good, as a simple voidnes of euill serueth them for a groūd of fidelitie: but I cannot see how to allow this opinion, since wee ought to preferre those which are good, and know why they are good, when againe these simple wittes are

easily both altered and deceyued.
            A Witte too pregnant and sharpe is not good: It is like a rasor whose edge the keener it is, the sooner it is rebated, or like soft wood which is readie to receiue the impression of the Limner, but for warping is vnable to keepe, and therefore not fitte for any worthie portraiture.. Men of this disposition are of a more quicke then sound conceite, hauing store of thoughtes rather stirred the disgested, in all their actions vnstayed and fickle, one while embracing an opinion, as seeming the best, then againe looking more nearelie, and not able to aunswere the doubtes, which are readie to enter an open inuention, fall to a straing kind of vncertaintie: the more thinking, the more not knowing what to thinke, verie irresolue where there is some probabilitie to breede on both sides coniecturall likelihoodes: For a working and craftie witte drawes commonlie with it a doubtfull and wauering iudgement: Such was noted

in Tiberius stirring vp trifling regards to containe him in suspence, rather increasing new doubts, then giuing any grounde to settle an opinion, being the true cause, why his speech was commonlie obscurelie doubtfull, subiect to a double interpretation, dissolued in it selfe, and not knit to any constant end. Such was Clement the seuenth, who hauing a pregnant witte, and a deepe knowledge in all the affaires of the worlde, yet comming to pointes of execution, was verie vnfortunatelie irresolute, readie to reduce the reasons into discourse, which first moued him to any deseigne.
            In Negotiations they deeme that of other mens proceeding, which in their owne case they would do, and in this securitie are oftentimes so ouerreached by their aduersarie, that they cannot returne without greate disaduantage and losse: Commonlie they follow rather subtle then wise counsailes, which for the most part doe not speed: they are pri
                     •
                  ae

specie laeta, thinges of apparance, and no substance, rather great and magnificent, then easie and secure, they are Tractu dura, and by how much the subtletie is the greater, by so much it is necessarie, that the handling be verie precise, or else they wil sort to no end, being like the clocke which most artificiously composed, is soonest disordered, and put out of frame, they are Euentu tristia, most odious to the world, & so disfauoured of God, that they are alway waited on with most vnprosperous ends The same of crafte is alway hatefull, and procureth enemies, and these cunning companions are of opinion that they can dispose the whole world at their pleasure, and I thinke this imperfection hath some similitude with that arrogancie of the Stoikes, which maketh men busie-headed and turbulent, desirous to be set a worke.
            Againe, quicke wits are readie in speech, but affected, high-flying Poets, but seldome Graue Orators,

commonlie betaking themselues to an humorous kinde of iesting, to play vpon any thing, and stirre the spleene, rather finding causes why a thing should be amisse, then willing to amende.
            And therefore wit doth in some respect resemble the Sunne, which so long as his beames wander abroad according to their naturall libertie, doth gently warme the earth, but when they are by a violent vnion assembled in the holow of a burning Glasse, consumeth that which ought to be refreshed: so Witte the lampe of mans little world, indewed with a sensible volubilitie, gouerneth our actions according to our desire: but being armed with vehement & working spirits becommeth the traitor of our blessednes, and therefore griefe is saide to bee the touchstone of the finest wit.
            To close vp this discourse, I approue a quiet discourse of reason: It is ordinarilie in a sanguine complexion, which is so tempered

with a measure of melancholie, that the sodaine motions and enforcements of the blood be allayed. These men are of a statelie presence, sound bodie, long life, readie to inuent, firme of memorie, copious to dilate, silent in tongue, secret of heart, determinate in aduise, regular in proceeding, wise in seeing the best, iust in performing it, temperant in abstaining from the contrarie. They are actu otiosi
                     •
                   simillimi they dispatch their buisines with such moderation.
            Such a wit will euen in the execution perceiue, and vpon present occasion determine, and take counsell, as fencers do in the listes, whom the countenance of the aduersarie, the bending of his bodie, the mouing of his handes doth admonish, how to proportion the distance, how to offend where is lest warde, how to defend where is strongest assault.
         
         
            
            
               Essay. 3. Of Education.
            
               EDucation is a good and continuall manuring of the mind, the principall foundation of all humain happinesse, and as the soule is the formall cause of our life: so this is the efficient of a good life, giuing light to the vnderstanding to know Good, and make differen

               e from the contrarie: confinement to the will soly to performe it, restraint to the growing affections, gouernment in actions, ablenes to the bodie, without which, men are burdens and eye sores to the common weale, nothing

but a number.
            
               -Et fruges consumere nati.
            
            Honest companie is like an wholesome aire, a man may profite much euen by the chanceable enterview of a good man, and hee that applieth himselfe to the conuersation of the wicked, is subiected to the cō
               tagion of their vices: but especially it is a thing of great consequence in young mindes, which are pliable & apt to be seasoned, eyther with vertuous or wicked resolutions, and to receiue the impression of any customs which their first companie (a warrant for common errors) shall by the silent perswasions of their proper actions impose vpon them.
            This is the reason why the qualities of the mind do commonlie run on a blood, & become hereditarie, insomuch that some families retaine proper customs naturalized in them. As in Rome the Pisoes were frugall: the Metelli religious: the App

            In restrayning the humors which may feede vices in youth, it is not good to aggrauate smal errors with termes of affected indignation: for it is a daungerous thing to vse a medicine stronger then the nature of the disease & complexion of the patient. The best course and of most efficacy in disposing generous minds is with reprehensions to mixe prayses: imitating wise commaunders, who seeing their souldiers dismayed do not vpb

               aid them with the name of cowardice, but by recording their honourable seruices, enflame them to imitate and surpasse themselues. The forme is in the Poet: O Achilles where is that valour which hath filed the world with your fame: doubtles you forget your selfe in ouerthrowing all the excellent things

you haue done, and distaining them with so shamefull a retirednes Thus hauing awaked him out of his sleepe of idlenes, he telleth him, Tibise peritura reseruant Pergama, and so maketh demonstration how he may honorablie redeeme the alreadie conceiued infamies.
            For as euill eyes, although they they can see there is a Sunne, yet through weakenes cannot delight in the Sunne: so a mind ouerweighed with the violence of passions, hardly admitteth that freenesse of speech, which reason might warrant, but requireth such a Phisition, who can let blood in the right veine, and then againe binde vp the wounde. Such corrections are smoothlie couered with an vnexpected prayse: and the memory of their former vertues toucheth the mind with a noble and feeling shame of the present fault.
            Againe, it is better to entreate by perswasions, then enforce by cō
               maundementes, for feare and seruile restraint (the instruments to compulsion)

exasperate free spirites▪ making them who would bee ouerweighed with the sweete violence of reasonable wordes, to cast awaye shame and perseuere in faultes. Euery man desireth to haue this commendation added to his actions, that they are naturall, and not affected eyther for feare of punishment, or hope of rewarde. Hee gouerneth better, who suffereth men to bee good, then hee that maketh men good: but aboue all I approue that moderation in parents, which shall seeme rather to haue found then rē

yet if there bee not a moderation vsed, young mindes will be presently discountenanced, and great spirites embased with no smal empairement of their worth: for little mindes, though neuer so full of vertue, can be but a little vertuous.

               THe exercise ought to bee such, which may occupie euerie parte of the bodie, as the play at the ball, neuer sufficiently commended by Gallen: or hunting, by which men are accustomed to contraries, to heates, to coldes, to watchinges▪ to fastings, to water▪ to beere, to wine.

            So when Rome was in her flourishing age, and began to terrefie all Countries with the fame of her expected greatnes, euen at that time, Ingeniura nemo sine corpore exercebat, there was none who freed his minde

               Some obiect, that howsoeuer this refiner of inuention learning is commendable in lower fortunes, yet in Greate men it is an occasion of more intollerable vices: that it rayseth their thoughtes into vaine regions of ambition, and to the accomplishment of things not Feasible, that it overmastreth their reasō with the sweete insinuation of haughty matters, directing them to worke their priuate ambitions with the publike inconuenience. To this I aunswere that the argument is taken onelie frō the abuse, and therefore of no validitie, because al reasons eyther of praise or dispraise ought to bee taken from the right vse, to which a thing is directed. Moreouer I thinke, that their conceit is inueagled with the same fury, which possessing some such goodlesse mindes, hath taught them to inueigh against the vnspeakable wisedome of the Creator, for this reason onely, because hee had endewed them with reason. For (say

they) as wine because it doth seldom helpe, but often distemper the sicke, is better deteyned, least through a soothing hope of doubtfull health, a certaine daunger bee incurred: so (this swift mouing of the mind) reason is better denied to creatures, because more abuse it to naughtinesse, then rightlie vse it in vertuous enterprises.
            And a little to vrge on this so strange position, Is there any wrong glozed, any right eluded, any discord sowed, any machination, or guile layed to entrappe the wel-meaning of honest men, but reason worketh it euen with a more refined sharpnes of inuention.

Shee worketh by congratulating her enemies with giftes, knowing that to be a course, where warie distrust might make no preuention of her malice. Nay, to leaue fables, and come to the life of truth historie: had not Nero great reason to supplant all those. whose libertie of minde hee could not endure, as a thing hurtful to his seate of tyrannie. His reason tolde him, that absolute power was giuen him from the Gods, that hee onelie as Lord could giue fortune to the world, and distribute haps, and mishaps at his pleasure▪ that it was an vntimely policy to preserue those men, who standing strong in their owne vertue and loue of the people might heaue him out of that abhominable iniustice and vsurpation.

               EXperience is the guide of the vnderstanding, the rule of will, the ouerruler of opinion, the soule, and most intier parte of wisedome, without which euen the most absolute Schollers cannot attaine to any degree of perfection in ciuil actions.

            For the meane, by which wisedome in ableth vs to foresee the successe, and accordingly after due consideration rule the present is coniecture, which by comparing thinges passed, presupposeth out of the same causes, the same effects: Now in this obscure and incertaine deliberation vpon the future, a man experienced is like him, who hauing tried a daungerous passage in his own person, & noted the by turnings which might diuert him into an error, can in the darkest night with a secure & forwarde alacritie, go the same way, and ouercomming all the difficulties, ariue at the appointed place, wheras another though furnished with the soundest

directions) yet neuer hauing proued it, quaketh at euery shadow) and hauing his spirites shut vp in amazement, plainelie hazardeth his person.

Here are the reasons, why some estates liue quietlie, others turmoiled in continuall disturbances, some flourish by the delights of peace, others by continuing warre, some spend lauishlie without profite, others sparinglie with honor.

            By this obseruation of noting causes and effectes, counselles and successes, likenes betweene nature and nature, action and action, fortune and fortune is obtayned that wisedome, which teacheth vs to deliberate with ripenes of iudgement, to perseuere in thinges deliberated, to execute with readines, to temporise

with inconueniences, to abide aduersitie, to moderate prosperitie, to know the Scriptures, but in such sort, that neyther superstition make vs vainely feareful, nor neglect cause vs to be contemptuously presuming. And by opening to vs the plottes, which gaue life to all the actions, it teacheth more then twentie men liuing successiuelie can learn by practise, as the Generall by seeing the counselles which gouerne the euent must necessarilie profite more then the Souldier, who not able to search into the causes, perceiueth onely the naked euents.
            But as Histories are diuerse, so their operation in benefiting the perusers are diuers. In some as it were in Cleanthes table, vertue is set out in her best ornamentes, as in the describing of famous battelles, where specious wars, the ruine of nations, the scituation of Countries, the vncertaine trauerses of fortune, the death of braue Commaunders, haue a certain kind of Maiesty linked with

delight, and the mind by conuersing in them is not onelie delighted, but also lifted vp with a spirite of better resolution, and raysed to thinke of imitating: These fil a mā with better courage, but faile in inabling him for the manage of ciuill actions.
            Another kind there is like labyrinths, relating cunning and deceitfull friendshippes, how rage is suppressed with silence, treason disguised in innocence, how the wealthy haue beene proscribed for their riches, and the worthy vndermined for their vertue. These prouoke vs to eschew their viletie and lacke of vertue, and to be rather viceles then greatly vertuous: and although they bee distasted by those who measure Historie by delight, yet they are of most vse in instructing the minde to the like accidentes. And sithens men prostituting their wittes to all hopefull endes of gaine, are ready to aduenture themselues in the like actions, they are the most necessarie thinges, that can be warned vs, to

the intent that in the like practises, me may seeke meanes of preuention and frustrate all the attempts of such subtlely euill companions.
            In this ranke I preferre Tacitus as the best that any man can dwel vpon: Hee sheweth the miseries of a torne and declining state, where it was a capitall crime to bee vertuous, and nothing so vnsafe as to be securely innocent, where great mens gestures were particularly interpreted, their actions aggrauated, and construed to proceed from an aspiring intent: and the prince too suspitiously iealous touching points of concurrancie, suppressed men of great deserte, as competitors with them in that chiefest grounde, the loue of the people: When Princes rather delighted in the vices of their Subiectes, eyther because euerie man is pleased with his owne disposition in another, or because by a secret of long vse, they thought those would most patientlie endure seruitude, whose

contemptible manners and viletie, might excuse their base subiection. Hee sheweth how enformers men of desperate ambition, sharpe-sighted in spying faultes, and cunning in amplifying occasions of dislike, forsware all honesty, redeeming the securitie of their own persons with the losse of good name, and liuing on the vices of men, as scarrabeckes on vicerous sores: How vaine men were preferred to be treasurers, that they might fall with their proper vanities and want of gouernment, being vsed like spūges, which after they had beene wet with the spoiles and extortions, were crushed and condemned that their long gathered wealth might returne to the Princes coffers.

            But yet these men ought to remēber that those mischiefes are but mischiefes to a baser minde. Quemcunque sortem videris, miserum neges: that although they were oppressed, yet they remained still superiors, gouernors of necessity, rather directing then obeying the vexations. And I will not denie but such corrupte mindes may also suckle venome out of the most wholesome flowers, and

armed with some dangerous Positions out of the treasure of bookes, may like poyson mingled with the best wine more forciblie hurt by trayning on their mischieuous purposes more cunningly: But yet mee thinkes, men haue great incitements to hold themselues vp in vertue, by seeing euill men so contemptuouslie set forth, quaking with the inner vpbraidings of conscience, not entertaining sleepe, but disquieted with a continually tormenting executioner: Wee may learne also to prayse God for our gratious Soueraigne, vnder whose peacefull raigne, wee are secured from all those miseries, and enioy all those benefites whose worth wee shall know, when wee suffer priuation of thē, vnder whom our subiection is to the law, our seruice obseruation, our obedience a care not to offend.

            In making vse of this Historie knowledge, we must not ascertaine to our selues the sequell of any thing to fall out iust according to the like case in the Historie, but determine of it, as a thing apte to chance otherwise: for an example only enformes a likelyhoode, and if we gouerne our counselles by it, there must be a concurrance of the same reasons, not onelie in generall, but also in particularities.
            In making iudgement of Historie, and consideratelie applying it to our present interestes, wee must speciallie regard the dispositions of the

agentes, and diligentlie remarke how they are affected in minde, which is the least deceyuing ground of forming opinion: for without this pondering, and knowledge of the qualities of those nations, which we meet with in reading, a mā is vnable to make any due comparison betweene the present particular, and the former example. But to leaue these disputations, and the causes of variety in Customes to the schooles, as a matter some will not graunt, & fewer vnderstand, I will onely giue some instances of the proper qualities of some Countries, which most familiarly occurre in reading. The auncient Romaines were men of an inuincible spirit, not dismayed with what frowning disasters soeuer fortune could suppresse their courage, and hauing a minde superior to all aduersitie, resembled Antaeus in the Poet, who so often as hee was thrown to the ground receiued fresh strength, but being lifted vppe, was soone tamed by his aduersary: so

Their valor made them quiet, and quiet wealthy: but according to the reuolution of al things with a swift & violent return

their wealth effiminated their valour with idlenes, idlenes occasioned disorder, disorder made ruine. And as the iron begetteth rust which consumeth it, and ripe fruites produce worms which eate it, so their greatnes nourished such vices as by little and little brought them to confusion, insomuch that a great time their state was maintained more by reputation of thinges done, then any other present foundation.

            But although learning bee of great consequence in perfection of a martiall man, yet experience is the chiefest point, neyther can a man be absolute by reading other mens exploites. The true Schoole of warre, is the fielde, and not the Chamber▪ the teacher is vse, and the best course for attaining is to bee present in the important deliberations, to obserue and ponder vpon the executions, to consider the euents, and the counsels which gouerned them, from which obseruation ariseth that wisedome, which inableth vs to make choice of our aduantages, to aduance opportunities,

               Essay. 10. Of Affabilitie.
            
               Affabilitie is like Musicke, which is made by a iudiciall correspondency of a sharpe and flatte, it is a

mixture of pleasingnes, and seuerity in such sort, that neyther gentlenes by being a derogation, weaken reuerence, nor seueritie loue. It is not sufficient to be alto

               ether reall in performing the effectes of a louing minde: but also euerie man requireth to bee assured by vtter apparances, as messengers of the inner intentions: And if by these oblations a man giue not his friend confidence and suretie, I may not vnfitly compare his beneuolence to an image, which in it selfe well proportioned, but not apparrelled in apte colours, doth want that delightfull lustre, which should satisfie the greedie eyes of the spectators.
            A man must bee not onely present in ministring any conuenience office, but also by sending forth in the countenance the paunes and assurance of loue, by exciting men to open and reueale their businesses, and by promising al conuenient furtherance. For as men warme in the youthfull desires of loue, take greatest

comfort by being seene of their Mistresse, and receiue more ioye from a wanton looke, then from any other sense: so among all the kind offices of friendship, there is none so desired, as this acknowledgement by outward respects, especially whē the ende is meere salutation: for there is no more contrarie enemie to true friendshippe, then the motion of proper interest.
            The Romaines not to defraud any man of a due and conuenient Congie, retained certain Admonitors (called N

                  menclatores) who should suggest the name, qualitie, and accounte of euery one they incountred, that they might be saluted in a conformable stile: for to looke straunge and disdainefull, to bee backward in returning these respects procureth hatred euen in the dearest friendes, so much more daungerous, by how much men can lesse endure to be despised, then iniuried, because other grieuances concerne onelie the bodie, and bringe this comfort,

that hee is some bodie in his conceite that so offended him: but the iniuries of contempte are a disreputation, and the offended taketh himselfe to bee accounted no body, and therefore such omissions can hardlie by any meanes bee redeemed.
            
               Caesar through his wonderful vertues had setled himselfe in the strong loue of the people, and with his easinesse and affabilitie, (as with sugar sprinckled vpon a bitter medicine,) had mittigated the g

               ich if it bee excellent, will easily sute it selfe in these Formes: for (as it was saide by one, whome to name were presumptiō) behauiour is but a garment, and it is easie to make a comly

garment for a body in it self wel proportioned, whereas a deformed body can neuer bee so helped by Taylorsarte, but the counterfeiting will appeare. Obseruation also is a good meane, but a carelesnesse in expressing doth adde a singular grace, as one motion in dauncing kindlie proceeding, performed recklesly, cunningly implieth that a man can doo better then he can. If there bee any art vsed, it must bee in hiding art, otherwise it will hold eyther of affected selfe conceite, or of tedious ostentation.
            Againe, it is not sufficient to prouoke men to disclose their interestes, by giuing ready audience and easie accesse: but also a man must patientlie attend their sutes, the behauiour being such, as may shew all our powers occupied in consideration of them, but by contradicting or foreconceiuing of the conclusion to breake off their conceites is a contempt, which toucheth the mind, and cannot bee redeemed with

neuer so great good pleasures.
            To denie a sute doth dismisse men discontented, therefore in some cases it is better to promise, althogh there appeare no conueniencie for the effectuating: for howsoeuer the present affaire bee disappointed, yet men are more pleased with him, whom they see hindered in dispatch of weightier occurrences, then they would bee if they receiued a flat deniall. This rule although it cannot stand with the strict preceptes and square of honesty, yet it is a speciall point of this qualitie, (which I may call with Cicero, Artificium beneuolentia colligendae) which is eyther a vertue, or cannot stande without vertue.
            Also benefits must seeme to be receiued rather of curtesie then of deseruing: and (amplifications drawne from the circumstances) it is good highlie to esteeme them, as matters of great moment and very necessary, and employed in time: for men loue to be accounted profitatable,

and to haue their seruices acknowledged.

            DIscretion is the Gouernesse of vertue, the rule of our behauiour,

the measure of our affections, the Mistresse of demeanure, that seasoning of our actions, which maketh them acceptable, teaching vs to bee comelie without wantonnes, handsome without curiositie, solemne without tediousnes, learned without vaine-glorie, friendly without factiousnesse, seuere without disquiet, valiant without brauing, courteous with grauitie, and benigne with Maiesty: and to conclude it is the ballance, in which wee should weigh all our actions. But least in setting forth the pointes of this qualitie, I should stray into the confines of wisdome, and intitle it to those actions which holde of an higher vertue, I will restraine it to such indifferent thinges, whose forme and qualitie of vsage may appertaine eyther to vertue or vice: But in performing them a man must bee precise: for the vulgar sort,

            Some men are so incapable, that they make small thinges great, easie businesses impossible, and enterprise nothing, which through their peruerse grace is not difficultly accomplished, whose frowardnesse a man may compare to the vnskilfulnesse of some Chirurgions, who in steade of healing, fester a wound, and in lieu of mitigation make the torments more grieuously daungerous, whereas expert Leaches doe with gentle lenitiues redresse the maladie before the Patient haue any feeling of pain. So men discreete hauing their spirits awaked to all circumstances manage matters with a more delicate deportment, and by certaine premised preparatiues

so dispose the mind of the other agent, as it may bee apt to receiue any form which they shall impose: And with the same art deale with those, who by a crooked nature shew themselues insupportable, or transported with the fury of passions vtter wordes full of disdaine. Now men indewed with this vertue of easinesse, (as cunning Vaulters by a nimble sleight saue themselues frō the impetuous assaulte of the aduersarie) eyther by drawing their reasons frō some vnexpected place, or by passing with a readines of apprehension to a more plausible subiect, or by sounding a farre off with some extrauagant wordes, so follow their vnderstanding, that at length they condescend, vsing the same consideration, which good Players at ball haue, who not to suffer a rest, do not onelie stand attentiue to send it to their companion, but with like heed prouide to retake it, by accommodating their person, & expecting is in the likeliest place: so they to

               IF wee will know, what wisedome is, let vs lay aside the curious questions of Schoolemen, and such as are truelie Nominalles, and consider it in the frame of our Microcosme: where are two eyes signifying foresight with pondering vpon the likelihoode of successe, two eares patientlie to admit the counsell of others, and not

to bee carried away with self complacence: one hart for perseuering in an vniforme resolution, and two handes for quicke dispatching, and putting it in execution: And this is wisedome, whereof there cannot bee deuised a more expressiue Hierogliphicke, then the composition of our bodies.
            This heauenly gifte, begetting in our heartes a secret and inuisible light, hath some resemblance to the eies of some couragious wild beasts, which in the morning when euerie silly creature maketh vse of the sight, repose themselues: but in the darke night see clearest, and then addresse themselues to pray: So wisedome in difficulte affaires such as are beyonde the straine, and leuell of a cō

                a common iudgement would do. Therefore men of a deepe insight & great vnderstanding, hauing neyther

degree nor riches, nor authorities, equall to their sufficiencie in thinges of small momente, as disproportionated to their vertue, behaue themselues sometime inconsideratelie carelesse: but admitted to the sweighing of great matters, vnexpectedlie come to reueale in deedes and conceites that greatnesse and maiestie which by the basenesse of their fortune was oppressed and kept vnder. Excitantur enim ad meliora magnitudine rerum, and they loue to be employed in that which might bee, rare excellent, singular, and aboue the ordinary capacitie.
            
            The first parte of Wisedome is deliberation, in which wee must resolue neyther with hast nor affection, the one not giuing time enough to discusse those thinges which ought to be considered, the other so occupying the minde, that no thought creepe in which doth not in all regards conforme it selfe to giue sufferance to that passion: wee must promise our selues nothing before our

conceptions are by great presumptions assured of successe. For the feruencie of hope maketh men somwhat more reckleshly negligent, insomuch that when they are disapointed, they are as impatiently grieued, as if they had falne from an essentiall felicitie, like nouice Marchantes, who forecounting great gaines, & failing of their fresh expectation, are suddenlie imbarked in that vnrecouerable mischiefe of debt.
            In counsell it is the greatest excellency (and in many natures rather to be wished then hoped for) to preferre the opportunitie of time before the suggestion of disdaine, to moderate deseignes according to the aduerse, or prosperous winde of occasion, to serue time and not obstinatlie wrestle with foule weather, but like an experienced Pilotte put into some harbor till the cleared skie promise a more secure passage. But wee must not betake our selues to those remedies, which doe rather declare the greatnes of danger, then redresse

the inconueniences, neither must we thinke in great deliberations to auoide all inconueniences: for it is impossible that in this worlde one thing be ingendred without the corruption of another, and euery commoditie is vnfortunatelie annexed to some discommoditie, But let vs remember

                  Rade volte aduien, che ad alte imprese

Slow counselles are fitte rather to preserue then encrease a state, speedy and quicke doe rather encrease then preserue: Agendo, audendoque res Romana creuit. But in cases of exigencie, the worst course is to bee gouerned by middle counselles, neither to be cautelous sufficiently in prouiding, nor earnest enough in executing.
            But as mines if they be secretly made, produce wonderfull effects, otherwise endamage more then they auaile: so counsels if they be wrapped vp in silence, are very fortunately powerfull in ciuill actions, but

diuulgated loose their force, when the other partie hath time to frustrate their ends.
            The way to keep a thing priuate is to acquainte no body with it: Those things which are knowne onelie to ourselues, cannot be common, those thinges which are imparted to another cannot be secret. No man but hath some friend, whose fidelitie he holdeth so assured that hee may safelie entrust him with his nearest touching secrete, and hee presently will with equall confidence to another disclose, till at length it be generally known.
            And how can a man exact that faith in another, which he hath violated in himselfe? or how require silence when hee hath not performed it? or what indiscretion is it by opening to another to enter a voluntary seruitude, and to liue awed, lest we discontent him? But in committing any secrets to another, we must imitate those, who in trying a new vesse

For as enuie is the shadowe of vertue: So when vertue shall come to that perfection, as to reueale it selfe to the worlde, then like the verticall sunne it abateth all shadowes, which the low creeping obie

            Essay. 15 Of Reputation.
            
               REputation is a common conceit of extraordinary vertue acquired not by the multitude, but by the gretnes of actes, by so stewarding a mans seasonable endeuours, as that which is done may be apprehended, as rare, singular, great, without paragon, admirable. Small vertues & of ordinary excellency winne both trust and loue: for the vnderstanding presently finding in them a degree of worthines, moueth the will to embrace them: but great vertues drawing with them a certaine diuine

competencie and greatnes, so amuse the intellectuall part in contemplation of their vale
                  ••
               , that the affection of loue is excluded as not able to honor, when the mind is neuer satisfied in admiring.
            Those actions doe chiefely settle this impression, which proceede from a discreete despising of those thinges, which the common sense of worldlinges apprehendeth to be desired: as to refraine from those lustfull affections, into which humaine imbecilitie is prone to seduce the most restrayned imagination: or to resolue against death, and rather incounter the most hideous formes of daunger, then ouercome by any vniust aduantages: or by commanding ouer all priuate interestes, by forgetting all naturall affections, when they stand not with an higher vertue: So Scipio by offering no dishonour or violence to that faire damsel Allucius his Spouse: So Fabritius in returning the traytorous Phisitian to his deserued punishment, So Manlius
               
by performing exemplary iustice vpon his sole sonne, obtained this esteeme, and a loue mixed with authoritie. Surely that action imported a wonderfull temper of mind, & an absolute victory of those passions which in such cases wold ouersweigh the best grounded resolution: For euen Aeneas himself, in whome magnanimitie doth shine through all mistie fearefulnes, hauing with a secure brauerie of mind, passed multitudes of his enemies, yet when hee hath taken charge of his Father, and his son 
                  〈◊〉
               , hee findeth himselfe disarmed of that vertuous indifferency, fearing their feare, quaking at euery shadow,

            To confirme our minds in this despisingnes, wee must direct our course to attaine the Hauen, and quiet of a good conscience, accounting all other thinges in no other proportion, then as the windes and tempestes, which would remoue vs from this determination, by forcing

And as wee must not contemne in this life, fame,

honor, wealth, friendes, and those thinges which in the deceiuable stile of appetite are called goods, and attributed to fortune, but by honest meanes endeuour their fruition, as thinges good or bad according to the vse: so wee must not delight in them for themselues, nor bee troubled in suffering their priuation, nor out of an humor of confidence prouoke miseries: Ascanius in a youthfull brauerie,

                  Optat aprum, aut fuluum descendere monte leonem:
               
But that desire proceedeth from a not well guided (but yet excusable) heate of vnripe yeares: Wee performe our deuoires, if void of feare (the onely thing to bee feared) wee so tollerate vnauoidable mischiefes, that they neither disturbe reason, nor driue the minde to vnrest: otherwise as a feauer do

            This aptresse of resolution, or of disposing a mans inward selfe, is waited on with valour and wisedom which are the two most principal pillers of Reputation, not onely in respect of their coherency in the same manner, as the eye and the hand, but because they rather come of a benefite of nature, then intente & choice (the one proceeding from a readinesse of witte, the other from a presence and courage of minde) drawing with them in a kinde of dependē

               ertues, if the common weale bee a partie in enioying them; win admiration. The actions which chieflie reueale them are victories in the fielde beyonde expectation, surprisinges of Cities, erections of statelie houses for common vses, graue and fortunate counsailing the State, discreete discharging of Embassages.
            To the obtayning this opinion, must concurre two other helping causes, as

thus obtained must bee fed by the like meanes, or else vanisheth as soone as it appeares to the worlde: This cōmendation must be accounted in no other measure, but as an incouragement to doe better, or as the aire, which maketh men grow vp in vertue, and quickneth the appetite to enterprise thinges of high deseruing prayse.
            For preseruing Reputation is required Religion, and (that concurrance of deuine vertue) felicity: When the opiniō of being religious is established, it seemeth that all other vertues must follow of necessitie, and by it all suspitions of any v

            The workes which chiefly betoken a man religious are, to apprehende, to aduance the Ministerie, to prouide for those, who doe not in plausible formes preach themselues, but despising such a pompous and malepert manner breath grace and truth: to furnish them with sufficient liuings, because there is nothing which more impaireth the reuerence due to that profession, then needinesse.

men of merite, when they finde desert vnacknowledged, presently with presumptuous rashnes conclude the defect in the Prince, and by making it the subiect of their conference, increase his esteem that was disappointed: for this reason Cato said, that he had rather that the people shoulde enquire why hee had no statue erected to his memory, then why hee had. And againe, I obserue that at the solemnising of Iunias funeralles among the images of twentie noble houses, were left out that of Cassius, her husband and Brutus her brother, to the intent to extinguish their memory: but yet they did shine aboue all the rest for this onely, because their images were not represented.

               ssions, and as the principal giueth vigor and motion to the rest: but it is a thing doubtfull and deceaueable, in respect of the imperfection of men: for no mam can demeane himselfe with such circumspection, that hee can satisfie and please all, because mens mindes are by nature insatiable, vpon euery accident changing opinion, inconstant, murmuring for trifling regards, alway disliking the present, and preferring thinges of expectation and hope, before certainety and quietnesse, insomuch that one fauour, if it bee not equallie giuen to all, but in any greatet proportion measured to one particular, cleane cancelleth the memory

of forepassed good turnes: Such is the nature of man, that late benefites are cleane lost if there bee not an hope to receiue more, and although the obligations bee neuer so great, yet one thing denied doth soly possesse the memory, and all our fauors are drowned in forgetfulnes. Feare is a more certain ground, then loue for maintaining authoritie, because loue is in the power of the louer, feare in him, that maketh himselfe feared: But yet feare procureth hatred, which although it bee dissembled so long as it is vnable to shake off obedience, yet when a greater force shall vntie that knotte, it will burst out into open contesting.
            Now because men easie bring themselues into contempt, men terrible and austere incurre hatred, there is another middle qualitie, which I may eyther call a louing feare, or a reuerencing loue following Reputation. This is a conseruer

of that obedience and authority, in which men of greate qualitie ought to retaine the multitude: for as the Elementes which otherwise stand at defiance, are by the heauenly Spheares conformed into wel ruled motions without violence or enforcement, onely obeyeing the noblenes of their nature: so men shew themselues willing to bee didirected by those, who preceade, and are enobled by an eminency of vertue.
         
         
            
            Essay. 16. Of Liberality.
            
               SOme receiue and entertaine fauorites with kind gestures onely, vnmeasurable in promises, but spare in ministring to their wantes, whome I may fitly compare to some fruites, which by a lushious smell, & delightfull colour inuite a man to eate, but proue vnsauory & distastfull. They that are the dispensers of Gods temporall graces must apply themselues to find out men of an honest and exemplarie life & to acknowledge their desert, Vt non sit tantum ex conscientia merces. They

are the second causes, which by giuing life and entertainement to vertue, must so dispose and prepare mē of honest demeanure, as they may bee fitte to receiue any forme of honour or place, which (the first mouer of the commō weale) the prince shall bestow vpon them: It is a faire title to bee the fosterer of desert, and the countenance of those, who through modesty are readie to retire from reuealing themselues in doing their countrie good.
            The rewardes of goodnes, or vice frame mē accordingly: few are of so iudiciall a wit, as they measure vertue for the inner peace and contentment, and not according to successe: others seeing the guerdon due to merit, abused in maintaining wickednes, thinke to obtaine by the same meanes, and fashion themselues accordinglie, and when euill men receiue fauour and place (besides the iniurie done to vertue) Ha

            This vertue must be naturall & amongst those thinges which cannot bee imputed to election, and exercised with delight to doe good: when it is encouraged by a grateful return of hoped gaine, it is nothing but a base kind of counterchange & marchandizing; It resembleth the diuine nature, which communicateth to all, and expecteth no future aduantages:

who quicksighted in spying secret dislikes, will make vse of such occasions, and by multiplying suspitions, winde themselues into fauour, by working a more worthier into disgrace: These men know no other habites but auarice, selfeseeking contempt of others, and an high esteeme of their own vnworthinesse. It is a difficult thing to sound their hollow dispositions, and cauterized consciences, but the best notes to know them by are these. They haue no conformitie with themselues, now commending, anone discommending the same thing, taking or putting of a person, as the time or place shall require: they neuer stand well affected with men of their own rancke or societie, but if they loue any, they must be Great men, It is an infallible signe of a crooked nature, (as Cicero sayeth,) to seeme affected to none but to Praetors.
