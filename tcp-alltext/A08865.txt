of saīt
Bernarde / called the
golden epistle / whiche
he sēt to a yōg
religyous man
whom he
moche loued. And after the sayd
epistle / foloweth
four reuelations
of
Saint Birget.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            The golden pystell.
            ¶An epystell of saīt Bernard / whiche
he sente to a yonge relygyous
man whom he moch loued / that is
called the golden Epystell.
            
               THat the wildernesse of
thy religion may waxe
swete & pleasaunte vnto
the / and yt thou shalte
nat be founde vnkinde
in ye syght of him that
was most mekely crucifyed
for the. I coūsayle ye that now
thou hast taken it vpon the thou cast
it nat lyghtly away / lest happely an
other more acceptable to god than
thou / take it and occupye thy place / &
that thou be cast out as a stinking
careyne. Consyder therfore how moche
thou art bounde to the very true
lambe / that is Christ / whiche was
ledde to be offred in sacrifyce for the
vpon the auter of the crosse / and suffred
many repreffes and most harde
scourgīges of them / of whom he had
suche compassyon that he wepte tenderly
vpō them. Therfore that thou

mayst atteyne to lyke thingꝭ / call vnto
thy lorde Jesu wt deuout prayer / beseching
hym that thou maist as a
true membre be onyed through gode
vertuous workes / to the very trewe
heed / that is Christ. But thou maist
nat come to that poynt without hys
grace do helpe thē / as wel before as
after. For without grace al thy workyng
shalbe vnprofitable & vayn / lyke
as he watcheth in vayn that beleueth
to kepe a cyte without our lord
            Therfore if thou wilt finde his grace
and be truely solitary / two thingꝭ
be necessary to the. The first is / that
thou so withdraw thy self fro all trā
               sytory
thinges / that y• care no more
for thē than if ther were none such / and
that thou set thy selfe at so vyle
a price in thyne owne syzt / that thou
accompt thy self as nought / beleuīg
al men to be better thā thou art / and
more to plese god. Also what soeuer
thou here or se of religyous persons
thinke that thei do it to a good intēt
though it seme nat so / for mānes suspytion
is oft disceyued / and therfore

iuge ye nothing in certeyn / speke neuer
any thing that may soūd to thin
own preyse / but labour rather to kepe
thy vertue secrete than thy vices.
In no wise speke no euyll of no man
how true & manifest soeuer it be / and
more gladly giue hering whā a man
is praised thā whan he is dispraised
Also whan thou spekest 
                  •
               et thy wordes
be true / sobre / apte / weighty / &
of god. If a seculer man speke with
the & aske of the many questions / as
sone as thou canst breke of the tale / and
set the to those thīges that be of
god. what worldly thyng of euer be
happē to the or to any other / how dete
beloued soeuer he be vnto the / care
nat for it / if it be prosperous and lyking
ioye nat in it / and if it be mistyking
sorow nat for it / but thinke all
as nought / and laude and prayse almighty
god. Seke solytarines asmoche
as thou can / so y• thou maist dilygently
take hede of thyne own gostly
helth. Fly talking & vayne iangelyng
as moch as thou maist / for it is
more sure way to kepe scylēce thā to

speke. After complyn speke nat tyll
masse be done on the day folowinge / but
it be for a gret cause. whan thou
seest any thyng that dyspleseth the / cōsyder
wheder ther be nat lyke thīg
in ye that displeseth other / & if ther be
cut it lightly away. And if thou se or
here any thyng that pleseth the / consider
wheder it be in the / & if it be holde
it warly / and if it be nat take it to
the / and so it shalbe to the as a glasse
to loke vpon. Grudge at nothing toward
no man / but whan thou belenest
it maye profȳte his soule helth / how
greuous so euer it be to the / neuer
afterme nor deny any thing hedily / but
let thy denyenges & affirminges
be alway tēpred with discretion
Absteyn thy self alway fro al mockī
               ges
and fro al dissolute laughīges / In
all thy sayēges behaue ye so that
thou haue a certaynte of al thy dedꝭ
and wordꝭ that they be true / & those
that be doutful / let thē go as thingꝭ
that be cuyll. The second y• is necessary
to the is / that y• shalte so fully
offre thy self to god / that thou shalt

say nothing nor do nothīg / but that
thou beleuest verily wyl please him / and
take hede of thy seruice wt great
deuotyon / so yt / that thou saiest with
thy mouth be also in thy hert. Haue
these thre thingꝭ always in thy mynde / what
y• hast ben / what thou arte
and what thou shalte be. what thou
hast ben / stinking corruption. what
thou art / a vessel ful of donge. what
thou shalt be / meate for wormes. Also
thīke on the paynes of them that
be in hel / and that they shal neuer be
ended. And y• for a lytel delectatiō in
this worlde they suffre tho paynes.
And lyke wise thinke on the glory of
the kingdom of heuē the which shall
neuer haue ende / & that lyghtly and
in shorte tyme it may be wonne. And
than remēbre how gret sorowe and
wailyng shall be to thē that haue loste
so gret a glori for so lytel a thing
Also whan thou hast any thing that
displeseth the or greueth the / thinke
that if yu shalt come to hel thou shalt
haue alway that dysplesur and al other
also that y• most dredest / whan

any prīcipall feest cometh / thinke on
that saynt that than is worshypped
in the church of god / what thīges he
suffred for Christ for they were but
short / & what he wanne therby for
they be euerlasting. Thīke also that
as well the turmentes of good men
as the ioies of euil men in this worlde
be past & gone / & that neuertheles
good men by their turmētes haue receyued
eternall glory / and euyll men
by their shorte worldly ioye eternall
payne / & though thou be neuer so slothfull / yet
take this lytell writing &
remembre & imagen all these thingꝭ
dilygently that I haue said / & at the
lest bethīke ye on the tyme that thou
thus lesest / & that they that be in hel wold
gyue all ye worlde for it. whan
thou hast any trybulacyons / thynke
that they that be in heuē want thē / &
that they that be in hell haue many mo.
Euery day at the lest whā thou
goest to bed / cramyn dilygētly what
thou haste thoughte the day before / what
y• hast done / & what thou hast
said / & how thou hast spent the precyous

tyme that was gyuen the / to
wyn therin the kyngdom of heuen.
And if thou hast past it well / thanke
god & laude him for it / & if thou hast
spēde it euyl & neglygētly be sori for
it & deferre nat ye next day to be confessed
 / thā I put this in the ende / to
thētent that yu shalt dilygētly imagī
as it wer two cites afore the / one ful
of all turmētes as hell is / the other
ful of al cōsolaciō as is the kīgdom
of heuē / & that it behoueth the of necessyte
to ētre & come in to the one of
thē beholde thā what mizt draw the
against thy wyl to the euyl cyte / and
what mizt let the fro ye good cytie / &
I trow that thou shalt fynde nothīg
that might do it (if thou woldest wt
all thyne heet turne the to god / & put
tyng away al neglygēce / woldest mekely
cal to him for grace & merci) the
which he yt is most blessed aboue all
vouchsaf to graunt vnto vs. Amen.
         
         
            ¶That nothing pleseth god so moche
as that he be beloued aboue all
thing / as our lady sheweth to saynt
Byrget by example of a pagan woman
 / whiche optayned great grace
for the great loue she had to her creatour / as
it appereth in the .vi. boke
of saynt Birgettes reuelations / the
l. chapitre.
            THe mother of god our lady
saynt Mary speketh to the
spouse of her son saint Birgit
 / sayeng thus. Nothing so moch
pleseth god / as that a man loue him
aboue al thing / as I shal shew to the
by a symilytude of a pagan woman / which
knowyng nothīg of the faith
thouzt to her self thus. I know said
she / of what mater I am come in to
this world / & of what thingꝭ I came
in to my mothers wombe. And I beleue
that it had ben impossyble that
I shuld haue had my body so knyt togyther
as it is / and my reson & vnderstanding
 / but they had be gyuē vnto
me / and therfore I know wel ther is
some creatoure & maker of me / that
hath made me a resonable creature / nat
deformed me lyke to wormes or

serpētes. wherfore me thīketh yt though
I had many husbādes & al they
called me / I wold rather com at one
callīg of my creatour / thā at the callyng
of them all. I haue also many
sōnes & many doughters / and neuer
the lesse if I saw them haue mete in
their handes / & I knew my creatour
to want meate / I wolde take ye meat
fro my chyldren and wold gladly gyue
it to my creatour / I haue also many
possessyons whiche I order after
myne own wyl / and neuertheles if I
knew the wyl of my creatour / I wolde
gladly leue myne own wyl & dyspose
thē to his honour. But my doughter / se
what god did wt this pagan
woman. He sent vnto her one of his
elect seruauntes yt enstructed her in
the faith / & god hym self visyted her
hert / as thou maist wel knowe & vnderstande
herafter by the answer of
the woman. For whan that man shewed
vnto her that ther was one god
without beginyng and without ending
 / that is the creatour & maker of
all thinges / she answered & sayde. It

is wel to be beleued that he that hathe
created me / & al thīges / that he
hathe no treatour aboue him / & it is
lyke that his lyfe is euerlastīg that
mizt gyne me lyfe. And whā the woman
herd farther that the same creatour
toke māhode of a virgyn / & that
he preched in this world & tauzt the
people in his own person / she answered.
It is to beleue god ī euery thīg
and thā she sayd further. I pray the
shew me what be the wordꝭ that my
creatour dyd speke & cōmaūde / for I
wyll holly leue myne own wyl & fully
obey to him / & to euery worde that
he hath spoken. Than whā he declared
vnto her of ye passion of our lord
of his crosse / his deth / & of his resurrection / The
woman wt great wepīg
answered & said. Blessed be my creatour
y• so paciētly sheweth his charyte
in the worlde / that be hathe to vs
in heuen. And therfore if I loued hī
               fyrste
bycause he created me / I am
now more boūdē to loue hī / bycause
he hath shewed me the streight way
to heuē & hath redemed me with his

precyous blode / & I am boūde therfore
to serue him with al my strēgth
and al the partes of my body / and I
am boūden also to remoue al my desyer
fro me yt I had fyrst to my possessyōs
& to my chyldren & kinsmen / &
only to desyre to se my creatour in
his glory that neuer shall haue ende
Thā sayde our blessed lady to saynt
Birget. Lo doughter. How great reward
yt womā had for her gret loue.
So is dayly gyuē gret rewarde to euery
mā after the loue that he hathe
to god whyle he lyueth ī this world.
         
         
            ¶Our lorde Jesu Christ gyueth to
his spouse saīt Birget a notable doctryne
of the lyues Actyue & cōtēplatyue
 / which he notably sygnifyed by
Martha & Mary magdaleyn / yt is to
say how a man shall begyn & profyte
in the lyfe spūall & in grace & vertue
that he may finally ascēde to ye high
degre of ye loue of god & of his neighbour / which
doctryn apperith in the
.vi. boke of the reuerlaciōs of saynte
Byrget / the .lxv. chapytre.
            
               
THe sōne of god speketh to his
spouse saynt Byrget / sayenge
thus. There be two lyues which be
lykened to Martha & Mary Magdaleyne
 / and who so euer wyll folow
tho two lyues / must fyrst make pure
confessyon of all his synnes / taking
very contricyon for them / hauynge
full wyll neuer after to offende. And
the fyrst lyfe / as I do witnes my self
in my gospel / Mary magdaleyn did
chuse whiche ledeth a man to cōtemplacyon
 / that is to say to the beholdynge
of heuenly thynges / and that
is the best parte & is the very way of
the lyf euerlastyng. Therfore euery
man that coueyteth to folow the lyf
of Mary / that is to say / ye lyfe cōtemplatiue / It
suffiseth to hī to haue only
the necessaris for the body / that is
to say clothīg without vanyte / mete
and drinke in scarcite / and nat in suꝑfluite.
Chastyte without any euyl delectacion / fastyng
& abstynence after
the ordynaūce of the churche / and he
that fasteth muste take hede ye he be
nat ouermoch enfebled & made weke

by his vnresonable fasting / lest thorow
that wekenesse he be enforsed to
lese his prayers & his counsayle gyuīg / or
other good dedꝭ wherwith he
myght both profite him self and his
neighbour also. And he must also dyligētly
take hede that he be nat through
his fasting the more slow to iustyce
nor more slacker to the workes
of mercy / for why / to punissh rebels
& to bringe infydeles vnder the yoke
of the faithe is required gret strēgth
as wel of body as of soule. Therfore
euery syke person yt wolde rather to
the honour of god fast thā ete / shall
haue lyke reward for his good wyll
as he y• fasteth of charite. And ī lyke
wise he that for obediēce eteth / desyryng
rather to fast than to ete / shall
haue lyke reward as he that fasteth.
Seconde the cōtemplatiue man shal
nat ioye of the honour of the worlde
nor of y• prosperite therof / ne sorowe
for his aduersite / but he shal ioy specially
in this / ye wicked men be become
denoute men / that louers of the
world be becom louers of god / & that

good men profyte in goodnesse / and
be through good labour & dilygence
in the seruyce of god made dayly more
deuoute than other. Of this also
the cōtemplatyue man shall sorow / 
that synners be made dayly worse &
worse / that almyghty god is nat beloued
of his creatures as he oughte
to be / and that the cōmaundemētes
of god be dispised and set at nought.
Thirdly the cōtemplatiue man may
nat be ydell / ne no more may he that
vseth the actyue lyfe / but anon whā
he hath taken his necessary slepe / he
shall ryse and thanke almyghty god
wyth all hys hert / for that he hathe
created & made all thinges / and that
of his charyte by takyng out nature
he hath reformed and renewed man
kynde / shewyng by his passyon and
dethe the loue that he hathe to man / whiche
is so great that none can be
gretter. Also the cōtemplatyue man
shall thanke almighty god for al thē
that be saued / & for all thē that be in
purgatorye / and for them that yet
be lyuynge in the worlde / prayenge

mekely for them vnto our lorde that
he suffred them nat to be tempted aboue
their power. The contemplatyue
man also must be discrete in his
prayers / and be well ordred in hys
laudes and praysynges of god / for if
he haue suffycient to lyue with / with
out labour or busynesse he must make
the lōger praiers. And if he be wery
and temptacyon ryse in his prayers
 / he may labour with his handes
some honest and profytable werke / eyther
for hym selfe / if he haue nede
or for other. And if he be in maner
yrkesome with bothe / that is to saye
with prayer and labour / that he may
haue some other honest occupacyon
or here some good holsom wordes or
profytable counsayles / in all sobrenesse
 / all scurrilytic and vnclene wordes
set a parte tyll the body and soul
be made more apte / and more able to
the seruyce of god. And if the cōtemplatyue
man haue nat suffycyent to
lyue withal but through his labour
than may he make the shorter prayers
for his necessari labour / and that

labour shall be the perfection and encreasynge
of his praier / and if he can
nat labour nor may nat / thā let him
nat be a shamed / ne thinke it nat greuous
to begge / but rather that he be
ioyous for it / for thā he foloweth me
the sonne of god / that made my selfe
poore to make man ryche / and if the
contemplatyue man be vnder obedyeuce / than
he must lyue after the obedyence
of his prelate and his rewarde
shall be double / more thā if he were
at lybertie. Fourthly the contemplatyue
man may nat be couetouse / no
more may the actyue man / nor he
may nat be prodygall / for as the actyue
mā distrybuteth temporall godes
for god so the cōtemplatyue mā
must dystribute his spiritual goodꝭ.
Moreouer if the cōtemplatyue man
wyll haue almyghtye god inwardly
in his herte / let him be ware to saye
thus as many do. It suffyseth to me
if I can saue myne owne soule / for if
I can do so / what haue I to do with
the dedꝭ of other mē / or if I be good
my selfe / what is it to me how other

lyue. O my doughter / they that say
or thynke so / if they sawe their frende
dyshonested and troubled / they
shulde renne with all their power to
the deth / that theyr frende myght be
delyuered out of his trouble / so shal
the contemplatyue man do / he must
sorowe that almighty god is offēded
that his brother which is hys neighboure
hath occasion to offende. And
if any fall in to synne / the cōtemplatyue
man shal endeuour him al that
he can to helpe hym out of his synne
with al dyscretyon. And if he haue
trouble or persecution for it / set him
leue that place and seke another place
that is more quyet. For I my self
that am very god / sayd to my discyples
thus. If they ꝑsecute you ī oue
cytie flye ye in to another: and so did
Paule / the which bicause he shuld be
more necessarye another tyme / was
let go by a walle in a basket. Therfore
y• the contēplatiue mā may be lyberal
& pitious / ther be .v. thingꝭ necessary
to hī. The first is a house / in
ye which his ghestes may slepe. The

secōd is clothyng to clothe ye naked.
The thirde is meate to fede the hungrye.
The fourthe is fyer to warme
thē that be colde. The fyfth is medisyns
for them that be sycke / that is
to say good cōfortable wordes with
the charite of god. The house of the
cōtemplatyue man is his hert / wherof
the cuyl ghestes be al tho thinges
that trouble his hert / that is to say / wrath / heuynesse / couetyse / pryde / and
many other lyke. Therfore all
tho vyces whan the come / they shall
in maner lye as ghestes that be a slepe / and
as they that be at rest. For
as an host receyueth euyll ghestes &
good with pacyence / so the contemplatyue
man must suffre all thynges
for god through vertue of pacyence / and
in no wyse to consente to vyces / nat
to thē that seme leest / ne to delyte
in them / but as moche as he may
be lytell and lytell through the helpe
of grace / to remoue them clerely out
of the herte. And if he can nat clerely
remoue them / he muste suffre theym
pacyently agaynste his wyll as enemyes

 / and neuer to assente to theym
knowynge certaynly that they shall
profyte him to the greatter rewarde
in heuen & nat to dampnacyon. Seconde
the contemplatyue man muste
haue clothes to clothe hys ghestes / that
is to say mekenesse / both inwarde
and outwarde / and compassyon of
mynde for the afflyction of his neybour.
And if the cōtemplatyue man
be dyspysed of the worlde / lette hym
thynke how I the god almyghty beynge
contempned and dyspysed suffred
pacyently / and whan I was iuged
I helde my peace / and whan I
was scourged & crowned with thornes
I murmured nat. The contemplatyue
mā also must take hede that
he shewe nat to them that reproue hī
or rebuke hym any sygnes of angre
or impacyēce / but that he blesse them
that persecute him / that they that se
it may blesse god whom the contemplatyue
man dothe folowe / and almyghtye
god shall gyue blessynges
for the maledictyons. The contemplatyue
man must be ware also that

he do nat speke euyll of them nor rebuke
them that do greue him / for it
is dampnable to bacbyte other and
wylfully to here them that do bachyte
or throughe impacyence to reproue
or rebuke his neyghbour. Than
y• the cōtemplatyue mā may haue ꝑfytely
the gyft of mekenesse and pacyence / he
must study to admonysshe
and warne them that do bachyte other / of
the gret peryll that they stā
               de
in / and that he exhorte them in all
charyte wyth wordes and wyth exāples
to perfyte mekenesse. Also the
clothyng of the contemplatyue man
must be compassyon / for if he se his
neyghbour do any syn / he must haue
compassyon of hym / prayenge to
almyghtye god to haue mercy vpon
him. And if he se him suffre any wrō
               ge
or hurt or reproue / he must be sori
for him / and helpe hī with his prayers / and
with his ayde and dilygēce
and that if nede be / before the great
men of the worlde / for the trewe per
fyte contriciō seketh nat that is his / but
that is his neyghbours. And if

the contemplatyue man be suche one
that he is nat herde with prīces / and
that it profyteth nat that he go oute
of his cell. Than be shall pray hertely
for them that be in trouble / and
almightye god that is the beholder
of mannes herte / for the charytic of
hym that prayeth / shall tourne the
hertes of the people to peace and quietnesse
of hym that is in trouble / so
that he shall either be delyuered out
of his trouble / or he shall haue pacience
sent him of god to suffre it / and
so his reward shalbe doubled. Therfore
suche clothynge / that is to say
mekenesse and compassyon muste be
in the hert of the cōtemplatyue man
for nothynge so myghtely draweth
god in to the hert / as mekenesse and
compassyon of the neighbour doth.
Thirdly the contēplatyue man must
haue mete and drīke for his ghestes / for
somtyme euyll ghestes do lodge
in the herte of the cōtemplatyue mā
that is to say / whan the herte is drawen
fro be holdyng of it self / and coueyteth
thīgꝭ delectable / to se worldly

things / to haue possessyon of temporall
goodes. And whan the eares
desyre to here his owne honour / the
flesshe desyreth to delyte in carnall
thynges / the spyrite leyth excuse of
his fraylnesse / and that synne is but
lyght / and whan ther cometh a painfulnesse
and a hardnesse to do good
bedes / and a forgetfulnesse of thingꝭ
to come. And whan he thinketh his
good dedes gret / and forgetteth his
euyl dedes. Agaynst al such ghestes
it is necessarye for the contemplatyue
man to haue good counsayle / and
nat to dyssemble as though he were
a slepe / but that he armed strongely
with trewe faithe / answere to suche
ghestes / sayenge thus. I woll haue
nothinge of themporall goodes / but
barcly for the sustaynynge of my bodily
kynde / and I wyl nat spende no
hour nor tyme / but to the honour of
god / nor I wyll nat take hede what
is fayr or foule in ye worlde / ne what
is plesant or dysplesaunt to the flesshe / or
sauoury or nat sauoury to the
mouthe / but to the pleasure of god

and helthe of my soule / for I wolde
nat lyue one hour but to the honour
of god. Suche a wyll is meate and
drike for the ghestes that come / and
that answere extincteth and putteth
away all inordinate delytes and plesures
of the worlde and of the flessh.
            Fourthly the contemplatyue man
must haue fyre to warm hys ghestes
and to gyue them lyght / this fyre is
the hete of the holy ghoste / it is impossyble
any man to leaue his owne
wyll / or to forsake the carnall loue
of his frendes or the loue of rychesse
but through the instynte and here of
the holy ghost. Also the coutemplatyue
man / howe holy and perfyte so
euer he be / may nat of hym selfe beginne
nor contynue in good lyf with
out helpe of grace in the holy ghost.
Therfore that the cōtemplatyue mā
may set a lyght before hys ghestes / Fyrst
let him thinke thus: Almightye
god hath created me / that I shulde
honoure hym aboue all thynges / And
in honourynge him / that I shulde
loue him & drede him / and he was

borne of a vyrgyn / to teache me the
way to heuen / and that I shulde folowe
that way in all mekenesse. And
with his deth he opened the yates of
heuen / that I shulde wyth great desyre
hast me thyder. Also the contemplatyue
man must examyn dylygently
al his dedes / all his thoughtꝭ and
all his affectyons / that is to say how
he hath offended god / and howe pacyently
god suffreth man / and howe
many wayes he calleth man vnto hī
such thoughtes and such gh
                  •
               stes of
the contemplatyue man / be in maner
but as they were a slepe / but they be
illumynate with the fyre of the holy
ghost: the whiche fyre than cometh
in to the hert / whan the contemplatyue
man thinketh how resonable it
is to serue god / and whan he thynketh
that he had leuer suffre all payne / thā
wyttyngly to prouoke god to
wrath / by whose goodnesse his soul
is create and made / and is also redemed
with his precyous blode. Than
also the herte hath here of this heuē
               ly
fyre / that is the holy ghost / whan

ye soule thīketh & discerneth to what
intente euery ghest / that is to say / euery
thought cometh. And whether
it moue the mynde to coueyte ioye ꝑpetuall
or transytory / and that he leue
no thought vndiscussed ne vncorrected
wyth drede of god. Therfore
that this fyre may be gotten / & whā
it is gotten that it may be safely kepte.
The contemplatyue man must ley
to drie stickes / that is to say he must
dilygently take hede of the motyons
of the flesshe / that it rebell nat agaynst
the spirite. And he must put
to all his dilygence that the workes
of pytie and good prayers may be deuoutly
encreased / wherwith the holy
ghost may haue delyte / but he muste
specyally knowe and consyder that
where a fyre is made in a close vessel
that hath no auoydaunce / anone the
fyre goth out and the vessell waxeth
colde. So it is wyth the contemplatyue
man / if he wolde nat lyue to no
thinge elles but that he myghte do
honoure to god / it is expedyent that
his mouth be opened / & that ye flame

of his charite go forthe. Thā is the
mouthe opened whan by his spekīg
whiche procedeth of feruent charitie
he getteth spirituall children to god
but the contemplatyue man must take
good hede that he opē hys mouth
to preche / wher good men shalbe made
more feruent / and where euyll mē
may be a mended / where right wysenesse
may be encreased / & euyl customes
maye be put away: For the apostell
Paule somtyme wolde haue
spoken but the holy ghoste dyd prohibyte
him / and so somtyme he helde
his peace / and whan tyme conuenyente
came / he speke / and somtyme he
vsed softe wordes / and another tyme
more sharper wordes / and alway he
ordred hys words to the honour and
glorie of god / and to the confortinge
and strengthuyng of the faithe. And
if the contemplatyue man maye nat
preache / but he hath good wyll and
connynge to prech and lacketh good
herers / he must do as the fore dothe / the
which goth about many mountayns
and sercheth with his fete in

many places / and where he fyndeth
the softest place and most apte for hī
there he maketh a denne to rest hym
in. So the contemplatyue man must
assay with wordes / with examples / and
with good praiers / the hertes of
many people / and where he fyndeth
the hertes most apte to here the wordes
of god / ther he must tary in coū
               saylyng
and in enducyng the people
to god all that he can. The contemplatyue
mā also must labour al that
he can / that conuenyent auoydaunce
may be had for his flame / for ye gretter
that the flame is / the mo be illumyned
and made hote therby. Than
hath the flame cōuenyent auoydaunce / whan
the cōtemplatyue man neither
dredeth rebukes / ne coueyteth
nat his own prayse / whā he neither
dredeth aduersyties / ne delyteth him
nat in prosperyties / and than it is
more pleasure to god that he do hys
good dedes openly thā preuely / that
they that se them may glorifye god.
And it is to vnderstand / that the contemplatyue
man must put forth two

flames / one secretely / another opēly / that
is to say / he must haue a double
mekenes. The first must be wt ī forth
in the hertꝭ the seconde must be with
outforth to the worlde. The fyrst is / that
ye contēplatyue mā thynke him
selfe vnworthy & vnprofytable to al
good workes / & that he preferre nat
hym self in hys own syght aboue no
man / ne y• he couete nat to be lauded
nor to be scene in the worlde / that he
slye pryde / & desyre god aboue al thinge / folowyng
his wordes & his techiges.
And yf ye contēplatyue mā put
forth such a flame wt good workes / thā
his hert shalbe illumined wt charytie / and
all the contraryous thynges
that come to hym shall lyghtely
be suffred and ouercome. The secōde
flame muste be openly / for if perfyte
makenesse be in the hert / it must also
appere in hys apparel without forth
and be herde in hys wordes / and be
performed in his dedes. Trewe mekenesse
is in th
                  •
                apparell whan the
contemplatyue man concyteth, more
to haue clothyng of small pryce / whiche

is profytable / than clothynge of
gretter value / wherhy he may fall in
to pryde / & in to a desyre to be sene in
the worlde / for that apparell that is
lytell worth / & is called in the world
vyle and abiecte / is verye fayre and
precyous before god / for it ꝓuoketh
mekenesse. And that apparel that is
of grette pryce and is called fayre in
the worlde / is very foule and vnsemly
before god / for it taketh away the
fayrenesse of angels / that is to saye
mekenesse. But yet if the contemplatyue
man for any resonable cause be
constrayned to haue an habyt somewhat
better than he wolde / let hym
nat be troubled therfore / for his rewarde
shal therby be encreased. Also
the contemplatyue man muste haue
mekenesse in hys mouthe / that is to
say in spekyng meke thynges / eschewynge
all rybaldry and superfluytie
of wordes / nat spekinge subtelly ne
disceytfully / ne preferring his sentence
before other. And 
                  〈◊〉
                the cōtemplatyue
man here hym selfe praysed for
any good dedes / let him nat be lyfte

vp in his herte therfore / but that he
answere thus. All laude and honour
be to god that gyueth all thynges,
what am I but dust in the wynde / or
what goodnesse cometh of me / that
am nought els but as drie erth withoute
water? And if he be reproued in
the world / let him nat be moued ther
with / but that he answer thus. I am
worthy all this and moche more / for
I haue so oft offended god / and haue
nat made amendes therfore agayne.
Therfore pray ye for me that by suffrynge
of suche temporall reproues / I
may escape the shames and reproues
euerlastynge. Aud if the contemplatyue
man be prouoked to angre
or wrath / by the vnskylfulnes of his
neybours / let him be wel ware & take
good hede that he answer nat vndiscretely / for
cōmenly pryde foloweth
angre & wrathe. Therfore it is good
counsayle that whan angre or pride
come / that he hold his peace so long
tyme / tyll the wyl may aske helpe of
god to suffre / and to take good auysement / howe
& what to answere / that

he may fyrst ouercome him selfe / and
thā 
               
                  •
               he wrath shal be abated in the
herte / so that he may answere wisely
to them that be vnwise. Thou shalt
know also that the deuyll hath gret
enuye to a contemplatyue man / and
if he can nat hinder him by breaking
of the cōmaundementes of god / than
he wyll styrre hī to be either lyghtly
moued with wrath / or to be disposed
to some vayne & vndyscrete myrthe / or
elles to haue some vayne & vnprofitable
wordes. Therfore the cōtemplatyue
man must alway aske helpe
of god / that all hys wordes & dedes
be gouerned by him / & be holly directed
vnto him. Also the cōtemplatiue
man must haue mekenesse in all his
workes / that is to say / that he do no
thyng for worldly prayse / ne that he
attempte no newe thinge of him self
and yt he be nat a shamed of no worke
howe vyle so euer it be / so yt he maye
therby please god / that he flye singularyte / that
he do good to al that he
can / and in euery good dede that he
doth / thīke yt he myzt haue do better

Also he muste chuse to sytte rayther
with poore men than with ryche / rather
to obey than to cōmaunde / to kepe
scylence raither than to speke / to
be solytary than to be with myghty
men or with his worldly frēdes. Also
the cōtemplatyue man must hate
hys owne wyll / ofte remembre his
dethe / flye curiosyte / all murmurīge
and grudgynge / alwaye remembre
the rightwysenesse of god / and take
hede of his own affections. Also the
cōtemplatyne man must ofte vse confessyon
 / be slable and dylygēt in his
temptations 
                  〈◊〉
                to desyre to lyue / to
none other entent / but that the honour
of god & helth of soules may be
encreased. Than if the cōtemplatiue
man that hath suche affectyons and
suche de
                  •
               y
                  •
               es / as is sayde before / be
chosen in to the offyce of an sletyue
man / and of obedyence & charyte to
god / he taketh vpon hym the rule of
other he shal haue a double rewarde / as
it may appere by this similytude
            There was a mighty mā that had
a shippe charged with precyous marchaundises / 

whiche sayd to his seruauntes
thus. Go ye with this ship
to such a porte / for ther I shall haue
ryght great encrease / if the wīde rise
labour manfully and yrke nat at it / for
youre rewarde shalbe great.
            After as the seruaūt sayled / a great
wynd rose / the stormes wered great
and the shyppe was tossed & broken
greuously. Than the gouernoure of
the shyppe wered wery & slowe / and
all that were in the shyppe dispeyred
of their lyues / & agreed to go to some
other porte / whither as the wynde
wolde dryue them / & nat to that porte
that their lorde had appointed thē
to. And that hering / one of the most
faythfull seruauntes & most feruent / sorowyng
through a great zele and
loue yt he had to his lorde / toke vpon
him the gouernaunce of the shyppe / and
with strength brought the shyp
to the porte that the lorde assygned
thē to go to. Is nat that man that
so manfully brought the shyppe to
the porte / worthy to haue gretter rewarde / than
any of his felowes?

yes trewly. So it is of a good ruler
that for the loue of god and helth of
soules / taketh vpon him the charge
of gouernaunce of other / and careth
nat for the honour / & trewly he shall
haue a double rewarde. First he shal
be part taker of the good dedes of al
them that he brīgeth to the safe porte
Seconde his glorie shalbe encreased
without ende. And contrarywise
it shall be of theym that come to honoure
& prelacy by theyr ambytion / for
they shalbe parte takers of al the
paynes and offences of al them / that
they toke vpon thē to rule. Seconde
their cōfusyon shall neuer haue ende
for prelates that coueyte honours / he
more lyke to strumpettes than to
prelates / for they deceyue theyr subiectes
by theyr euyll examples and
their euyll wordes / and be nat worthy
to be called neither Cōtemplaryue
men / nor Actyue men / but they amende
and do due peuaunce. Fyftly
the contemplatyue man muste gyue
medicyns to hys ghestes / that is to
say / he must confort them with good

wordes / and to al thynges that come
lykyng or mislyking / plesaunt or displesaunt / he
must say thus. I wyll
euery thinge that it pleaseth our lorde
that I shulde wyl / though I shulde
go to hell. Aud trewly such a will
is a medicyn to all thīges that come
to the herte / & is a delyte in all troubles
that come / and a great temperaunce
in all prosperite. But bicause
the cōtemplatiue man hath many
enemyes / therfore he must oft make
confessyon / for as longe as he wylfully
abydeth in synne / hauing tyme
and oportunyte to be confessed / and
is neglygent or hebeth it nat / he is
rather to be called an Apostata before
god / than a contemplatyue man.
The Actyue lyfe. Also of ye dedes of
a mā that lyueth in the actyue lyfe.
Thou shalte vnderstāde that though
the parte of the contemplatyue man
be best / that yet the parte of the actiue
man is nat euyl / but it is very laudable
and moch plesaūt to god / therfore
I shall shewe the nowe how the
actyue man must ordre him self. He

must haue as the cōtemplatyue man
hath / fyue thīges. The fyrst is trewe
fayth of holy churche. The seconde
is that he knowe the cōmaundementes
of god / and the counsayls of the
Euangelycall truthe / and theym he
must performe / in wyll / worde / and
dede. Thirdly he must refrayne his
tonge fro all euyll wordes / that are
agaynst god and his neighbour / and
his handes fro all vnhonest and vniaufull
dedes. And his mynde fro ouermoch
desyre of worldly goodes / &
fro ouergret delite of worldly pleasures
and 
                  〈◊〉
                to be contente with
that god hath sente him and to desyre
no superfluous thinges. Fourthly
he shall do the dedes of mercy resonably
in all mekenesse / so yt for trust
of the good dedes / he in nothing offende
god. Fystly he must loue god
aboue all thynges / & that more thā
him self as Martha dyd / for she gaue
her selfe gladly to me / folowyngeiny
wordes & dedes / and afterwarde
she gaue all her goodes for my loue / and
lothed all temporall thinges desyring

onely thynges euerlastyng / &
therfore she sustayned all thīges pacyently
as they came / and cared as
well for the helthe of other as of her
selfe / thinkynge alway of my charytie
and on my passyon / and she was
gladde in troubles / mery in aduersyties / &
loued all people as a mother
her chylde. She wolde also ofte folowe
me / whan I was in the worlde
desyringe nothyng but to here me.
She also had cōpassion of them that
were in trouble. She cōforted them
that were in heuynesse / releued them
that were sycke / she cursed no mā ne
sayd euyll to no mā / but dissymuled
the euyll maners of her neyghbours
all that she myght / & prayed alwaye
for them. Therfore euery man that
desyreth to lyue charitably in ye actyue
lyfe / must folowe Martha / louīg
his neybour / to the ende that he may
come to heuen / but nat to fauour his
synne or euyll lyfe / flyeng his owne
prayse / and pryde / & doublenesse of
herte / and wrathe and enuy he maye
nat folowe. But thou shalte vnderstande / 

that whan Martha prayde
for her brother Lazar that was deed
she came fyrst to me / but her brother
was nat raysed forthwith vpon her
cōmyng / but afterward Mary was
called / and whan she came / thā at the
prayer of them both togyther / theyr
brother was raysed fro dethe. So it
is spyrytually / for he that desyreth
perfytely to come to the lyfe contemplatyue / must
fyrst exercise him selfe
well in the actyue lyfe / labouring all
that he may to the honoure of god in
good bodily labours. And lerne first
to resyst all fleshly desyres / & to with
stande myghtely the fendes temptations / and
than he maye afterwarde
with good delyberatyon ascende to
the hygher degree / that is to say / to
the lyfe cōtemplatyue / for he that is
nat proued & well assayed with tēptations / and
hath nat yet fully ouer
come the euyll motions of the fleshe / may
nat holly sette him selfe to heuē
               ly
thynges. But who is the dedde
brother of thactyue man / and of the
contemplatyue man / but their vndiscrete

dedes / for many tymes a gode
dede is done with an vndiscrete ē
               tente
and of an vnconstaunt mynde / and
therfore it is but as it were deed
wherfore that a good dede may be acceptable
to god / it is raysed agayne
and cometh to lyfe by the actyue m
                  •
               
and by the cōtemplatyue man / that
is to say / whā the neibour is purely
loued for god & to god / & god is only
desyred for him selfe aboue al thīgꝭ.
And than euery good dede of man or
woman is plesaūt to god. Therfore
I sayde in my gospell / that Marye
had chosen the better parte. The
lyfe of the Actyue man is good / whā
he soroweth for the sīues of his neybours / but
his parte is better whan
he laboureth all that he maye that
his neyghbours may do well & perseuer
well vnto the ende / & that he do
all that he doth for the loue of god.
But the parte of the contemplatyue
man is best / whā he onely beholdeth
heuenly thingꝭ & the helth of soules.
whan the mynde is fulfylled wt good
affections / and whā he is wel at rest

fro the clamorous noyce of worldly
busynesse / and thynketh alway god
present vnto him / & setteth his meditations
fully in the loue of god / and
laboureth fruitfully therin both day
and nyght.
