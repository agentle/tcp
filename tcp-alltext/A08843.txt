PALATINATE.
            The affaires of the PALATINATE, conſiſt
in foure principall heads.
            
               Concerning the firſt head.
               FOR this many ages paſt the Realme of Boheme
hath beene alwayes holden both within and without
the Empire for electiue and not hereditarie.
The Letters Reuerſalls of all the Kings of Bohemia
which haue ſucceſſiuely beene, euen to the Emperour
Ferdinand the ſecond, haue a cleare and expreſſe
recognition and confeſſion that they haue, and
poſſeſſe it not by any hereditary right, but by the free
election, good will, and conſent of the eſtates of the
ſaid Realme, according to the Golden Bull, their liberties
and priuiledges. There hath not beene any
but onely the Emperour Ferdinand the ſecond, who
hath challenged a partenſion of a ſucceſſion hereditary,
the which hee foundeth principally vpon a certaine
diſpoſition of the King Vladiſlaus his great
Grandfather by his Mothers ſide, made on the ſixth

day of Ianuary 1510. in regard of the Dutcheſſe Anne
his daughter, who was afterward the wife of the Emperour
Ferdinand the firſt; the Copie whereof enſueth
word for word.
               
                  Vladiſlaus by the grace of God, King of Hungary,
Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatio, &c. Marqueſſe of Morauia,
Duke of Lucemburg and of Sileſia, Marqueſſe
of Luſatia, &c. Be it knowne to all men by theſe preſents,
ſince that God by his diuine grace hath giuen
vs heires both ſonnes and daughters, and that by his
diuine prouidence, as alſo by the aduiſe and counſell
of our Subicots, Prelates, Princes, Lords, and all the
eſtates of our Realmes, wee haue firſt cauſed the moſt
excellent Prince, King Lewes our moſt beloued ſonne,
to be crowned King of Hungary, who afterward by
the free will of the Barrons, Nobles, and Townes of
the Kingdome of Boheme, hath beene crowned and
receiued in the ſame Realme. But if it ſhall happen
that the ſaid King Lewes dye without heires (which
God forbid) then the Dutcheſſe Anne our daughter
ſhall remaine, and be true heire of the Realme of Boheme
land, by power and vertue of the rights, conſtitutions,
and priuiledges of the Realme of Boheme. And we
hauing had regard vnto that, and conſidering the ſingular
affection, deuotion, and promptitude, that our
Subiects of both our Realmes ſhew vnto vs; we thinke
and iudge it to be right and equitable to prouide for
them in ſuch ſort, that for the neceſſities of the affaires
of theſe two Crownes and Realmes, they may treate
and negotiate in their owne mother tongues, with our
heires and their future Lords. And for that cauſe we
haue ordained, and doe ordaine, that our heires haue

to make their abode in a place fit and conuenable, to
the end that the ſubiects of the Crowne of Hungarie,
as well as they of the Crowne of Bohemia, and thoſe
of the Crowne of Bohemia, as well as they of the
Crowne of Hungarie, may enioy and haue their preſence,
and may haue acceſſe vnto them. They ſhall be
alſo bound and obliged to entertaine neere vnto them
an equall number of men and women, Natiues of the
Kingdome of Bohemia and Hungarie, to the purpoſe
that they may learne the Languages of Hungarie and
of Bohemia freely, and without impeachment. And
that the Eſtates of euerie one of the ſame Crownes
may ſufficiently and at large conferre with them in
their owne Languages, touching their neceſſities.
Moreouer, wee promiſe vnto them of the Realme of
Bohemia, not to marry, nor to promiſe in marriage the
Ducheſſe Anne, our daughter, without their counſaile.
And wee promiſe all this which is contained in theſe
preſents, in the word of a King, and doe alſo promiſe
vnto the Barons, Nobles, and all the Eſtates of the
Realme of Bohemia, to obſerue it fully and inuiolably
without any cōtrauention, in any faſhion whatſoeuer.
In witneſſe whereof, wee haue cauſed our Royall Scale
to be ſet vnto theſe preſents aboueſaid. Yeuen in our
Caſtle of Prage, on the Friday after the Feaſt of the 3.
Kings, in the yere of our Lord 1510. and of our raigns,
to wit, of Hungarie the 20. and of Bohemia the 39.
               This diſpoſition of the King Vladeſlaus is ſet downe
by the Emperour Ferdinand at this time, for the ſtrongeſt
Beſe and foundation for the hereditarie right that
he claymeth vnto the Crowne of Bohemia, foraſmuch
as the Ducheſſe Anne, his grandmother, is called heire
of the Realme of Bohemia, and that (as hee ſayth)

by vertue of other precedent agreements. Now I
will not enlarge my ſelfe heere to diſpute vpon this
Foundation (for that the Eſtates of Bohemia haue
alreadie refuted it very amply and ſolidely by their
Writings, and eſpecially by their Booke called the
Deduction, which they publiſhed in the yeere of our
Lord, 1620.) But I would onely (as by the way)
ſhew the manifeſt nullitie thereof, by the contradiction
that is therein.
               For firſt it appeareth by the Reuerſalls of the ſaid
King Vladiſlaus, giuen vnto the Eſtates of Bohemia
on the day of his Aſſumption to the Crowne, that he
acknowledged and confeſſed, that hee obtained and
receiued the ſaid Crowne, by the pure, ſranke, and free
will and election of the ſaid Eſtates, and not by any
right hereditarie. If then hee had not any right hereditarie,
much leſſe had he power to conferre and giue
a right of ſucceſſion hereditarie vnto his daughter.
               Secondly, if in regard of his perſon he had had ſuch
a right of ſucceſſion, yet it had not beene lawfull for
him to diſpoſe thereof vnto his ſonne, for that the
Realme and Electorate of Bohemia was holden of the
Empire only to the heires males, as the other Electorates
be, and cannot fall vnto the Diſtaffe; Women
being vncapable to performe the Functions and Offices
of men, required in the Office of the Electors, by
vertue of the Golden Bull.
               Thirdly, the ſaid diſpoſition containeth a moſt
groſſe and palpable abſurditie, in that the King Vladiſlaus
ſaith in it, that his ſonne hath beene receiuea by the
free choiſe of the Barons, Nobles, and Townes of the
Realme, and that hee addeth then by and by, that his

daughter ſhalbe heire of the ſaid Realme after his death:
for if the ſonne could not come thereto, but by the
way of free election, how can it be concluded, that
the daughter haue a right of ſucceſſion hereditary in
a eſtate taile vnto the heires males, which her brother
had not? And to make this abſurdly more euident,
behold the Copie of another Letter Reuerſall, which
Vladiſlaus gaue vnto the Eſtates of Bohemia, when
that they deſigned & accepted Duke Lewis his ſonne
for to be their future King.
               
                  Vladiſlaus by the grace of God, King of Hungary
and Bohemia: Be it knowne vnto all men whoſoeuer
that ſhall ſee or heare theſe preſents. Foraſmuch as
the Barrons, Nobles, the Townes of Prague, and the
other Townes, together with the communalty of the
Realme of Bohemia, hauing by their free choyſe, and
without any obligation of theirs thereunto choſen and
crowned, in our life time the Sereniſſime Prince and
Lord Lewis King of Hungary, as they before time
haue done vnto vs their affection, by the ſaid election
of King Lewis our ſonne, yet with this charge, that
as long as we ſhall be in life, we ſhall retaine and hold
the gouernment and poſſeſſion of our ſaid Realme,
and the Prouinces incorporated without any impeachment
of King Lewis our deareſt ſonne vntill our
death. That on the other part we will not faile continually
to acknowledge it, and will protect and giue
order, that they ſhall be maintained without any trauerſe
or trouble in their rights, franchiſes, priuiledges,
and cuſtomes, as wee haue promiſed and doe
promiſe them by theſe preſents, when that King
Lewis our moſt deare ſonne ſhall come vnto the age

of maioritie, and after our deceaſe ſhall take poſſeſſion
and adminiſtration of his Realme of Bohemia, hee
ſhall be obliged to doe and accompliſh all that which
the Kings of Bohemia, our predeceſſors, as alſo our
ſelues haue done and accompliſhed by Obligation, in
ſuch manner and forme as wee haue giuen them expreſſe
Letters, ſigned with our hand, and ſealed with
our Scale, with this reſeruation, That if King Lewes
our deareſt ſonue doth not accompliſh all that which
is contained in our ſaid Letters to them exhibited, in
ſatisfying to all that vnto which the Kings of Bohemia
are bound, they ſhall alſo not be bound on the other
part to admit the ſaid King Lewes in the poſſeſſion and
gouernment of the Realme, and that for ſo long time,
and vntill that he hath made totall ſatisfaction, according
to the more ample purport of our ſaid Letters:
but when hee hath made ſuch ſatisfaction, the ſaid Eſtates
and they of the Prouinces incorporated ſhall be
reciprocally obliged and bound to ſweare vnto him
loyaltie, and to be faithfull vnto him in all humilitie,
as vnto their crowned King.
               After the death of King Lewes, who was ſlaine in the
battaile of Mohaz, in the yeere 1526. the Archduke
Ferdinand married the ſaid Ducheſſe Anne, and ſent
the ſame yeere his Embaſſadours vnto the Eſtates of
Bohemia, requiring them to chuſe and receiue him for
their King, alledging amongſt other reaſons, that the
ſaid Anne his Wife was the neereſt vnto the Crowne:
and though that the Eſtates graunted his requeſt, in
giuing the Scepter and Crowne vnto him, this was
not in any ſort in contemplation of the pretenſion
of his Wife, but of their free conſent, as is moſt

euidently ſeene by his Letters Reuerſalls, which
follow:

               True it is, that theſe Reuerſalls were afterward deliuered
vp by the Eſtates of Bohemia vnto King Ferdinand,
at his inſtance, who put in the ſtead of them other
Reuerſalls, where many things are found to be
changed, againſt che intention and approbation of
the ſaid Eſtates.
               The Emperor Ferdinand the firſt, and the ſaid Anne
his wife had a ſonne called Maximilian the ſecond, and
Charles d'Auſtria, the Eſtates of Bohemia choſe Maximilian
the ſecond Emperor, who gaue vnto them Reuerſals,
like in ſubſtance to thoſe which his father had
giuen, in acknowledging their free election, without

pretenſion of any right. After his death, they choſe Rudolph
the ſecond, Emperour, his ſonne; and in the life
time of the Emperour Rudolph, they deſigned for their
King the Archduke Matthias, who was alſo afterward
Emperour. It is fit to be noted, that the ſaid Emperours,
Maximilian, Rudolph, and Matthias, though all
deſcended from the ſaid Anne, and all by right of priority
to be preferred before the ſaid Archduke Charles
and the Emperour Ferdinand the ſecond, his ſonne,
haue at their aſſumption vnto the Crowne of Bohemia,
frankely confeſſed by their Reuerſals not to pretend
vnto it any hereditarie right, but to haue recceiued
it by the free Election of the Eſtates; and eſpecially
the Emperor Rudolph hauing in his life time conſented
vnto the Election of Matthias his brother, gaue them
a very ample and large Letter of Aſſecuration, dated
on the Saterday after Quatuor tempora, in the yeere
1608, That the ſaid deſignation ought to be holden
for a free and voluntarie Election & Reception, without
any preiudice vnto their Priuiledges, Rights, Statutes,
Cuſtomes, and ſuch like things. In like manner,
the Archduke Matthias made his Reuerſals, dated on
the Wedneſday after S. Iohn Baptiſt, acknowledging
and confeſſing by them, repeating it often and in plain
words, That it was not by Obligation, but by a franke
and free Electionand wil, that the ſaid Eſtates had deſigned
and receiued him for King, after the deceaſe of
the Emperor Rudolph, his brother.
               
                  An Extract of the Reuerſals of the Empereur
RVDOLPH.
                  FOraſmuch as wee, as King of Bohemia, haue giuen
our conſent vnto the Eſtates, that at ſuch time as

the ſaid Archduke Matthias of Auſtria, our eldeſt brother,
when he ſhall requeſt them lawfully and duly, according
to their priuiledges and liberties, be choſen after vs
for heire apparant of the Realme of Bohemia, &c.
                  And a little lower:
Wee and the Archduke Matthias, our brother, when
he ſhall haue obtained ſuch prouiſion, will puruey and
aſſure the ſaid Eſtates by Reuerſals ſufficient for that
purpoſe, That the ſame ſhall not bring preſently nor
hereafter any preiudice or damage vnto their priuiledges,
liberties, good and laudable cuſtomes, and vſages, &c.
                  And yet more low:
Wherefore wee for vs, our heires, and the Kings of
Bohemia that ſhall be hereafter, promiſe vnto all the
Barons, Nobles, Townes of Prage, other Townes, and
to all the Communaltie repreſenting the Eſtates of
the Crowne of Bohemia, That the ſaid free Election of
the Archduke Matthias, our moſt deare brother, for to
be heire apparant, and after our death King of Bohemia,
ſhall not apport from henceforth, at this preſent,
nor in times to come, any preiudice, damage, or derogation
vnto them, nor vnto their Rights, Statutes, Priuiledges,
Libertries, Ordinances, Benefits, neyther to
all the old and other Cuſtomes, good and laudable
Vſances, eſpecially vnto the Obligations vnto them
giuen by the King Ottocarus, by the King Iohn, by the
Emperour Charles, by the King Vuenceſlaus, by the
Emperour Sigiſmund, by the King Albert, by the King
Ladiſlaus, by the King George, by the King Vladiſlaus,
by the King George, by the King Vladiſlaus,
by the Emperour Ferdinand, and by the Emperour
Maximilian, our moſt deare Lord and Father, &c.
               
               
                  
                  An extract of the Reuerſals of the Archduke Mathias.
                  THe Eſtates haue choſen vs with one conſent of
their good franke will for heire apparant, and King
of Bohemia, &c. And lower:
                  Wherefore following our ſaid conſent, we promiſe
for vs, our heires and ſucceſſors, vnto all the Lords, Nobles,
and Townes of Prague, as alſo vnto other Townes,
and all the Communaltie, repreſenting the Eſtates of
the Crowne of Bohemia, That this free election of our
perſon, &c. ſhal not bring nor apport any preiudice or
derogation vnto their Rights, Ordinances, Priuiledges,
Franchiſes, Statutes, Benefites, nor to all their iuſt
and ancient Cuſtomes, ſpecially vnto the Obligations
to them giuen by the King Ottocarus, by the King Iohn,
by the Emperour Charles, by the King Vuenceſlaus, by
the Emperour Sigiſmund, by the King Albert, by the
King Ladiſlaus, by the King George, by the King Vladiſlaus,
by the Emperour Ferdinand, our gracious Lord
and Father, and by the Emperour Rudolph, &c. And
yet a little more lower:
                  
                     Item, we promiſe, That during the life of our deareſt
Lord and Brother, not to intrude our ſelfe into the
guidance and gouernment of the ſame Realme of Bohemia,
nor of the Duchies of Sileſia, nor of the high
nor of the low Luſatia, &c. But if it ſhall happen, that
wee will draw vnto vs the domination & gouernment
in the life of his Imperiall Maieſtie, or elſe if wee will
not performe and doe (at ſuch time that wee ſhall
come vnto the Crowne of Bohemia) the ſame which
the Imperiall Maieſtie and the other precedent
Kings of Bohemia haue done and performed touching
the Oath, and all other things pertaining thereunto;

                     The Eſtates ſhall by no meanes be likewiſe bound vnto vs.
Then ſince that the eldeſt ſonnes of the Queene Anne,
and the two eldeſt ſonnes of him, haue one after the
other receiued and accepted the Crowne of Bohemia,
wholy from the pure good will and free election of
the Eſtates, and not by any ſucceſſion hereditary, there
is no likelihood nor reaſon the preſent Emperour Ferdinand,
comming of the younger ſonne of the ſaid
Queene Anne, ſhould haue more right and pretenſion
hereditary vnto the ſaid Crown which they neuer had.
                  To the which you may adde, that after the death
of the Emperour Matthias, in the yeare 1619. when it
was queſtioned to chuſe a new Emperor, the Elector
of Mayence, Arch-Chancellour of the Empire, called
and cited the Emperour Ferdinand (who was not yet
aduanced vnto the dignity Imperiall) vnto the Dyet
of Franckfort, to aſſiſt and to be preſent at the Election
of the Emperour, as King & Elector of Bohemia,
choſen, receiued, annoynted, and crowned by the ſaid
Eſtates, as hee hath expreſſedly declared by his Apologie,
publiſhed and printed againſt the cōplaints the
Ambaſſadours of the ſaid Eſtates made in that time
of ſuch like conuocation, which they ſaid was done
vnto their preiudice, for that they were then in controuerſie,
and had lawfull exceptions againſt the ſaid
Ferdinand: In like manner, the other Electors receiued
him into the Conclaue Electorall, not in reſpect of
any right hereditary, but onely in reſpect of his Election,
reception and Coronation that the ſaid Eſtates
had made of his perſon; this is that which they expreſſed
one to the other in the ſaid Dyet, and that all
the three Eccleſiaſticall Electors haue ioyntly with

the Elector of Saxony reiterated afterwards in their
Letters written from Mulhauſen, as well to the King
Frederick as vnto the ſame Eſtates, & vnto ſome other
Princes of the Empire, for to let them to vnderſtand
that the King Frederick had not entred into a Realme
void of a King, and vacant, but already prouided
of another King, deſigned, choſen, and crowned by
the ſaid Eſtates: So alſo they in the ſaid reception of
him into the Conclaue Electorall, had not any regard
vnto ſucceſſion hereditary, for otherwiſe they had
done wrong vnto the Archduke Albert, to ſet behinde
and exclude him, for by right in that caſe hee ought to
haue beene preferred before the Archduke Ferdinand
now Emperour, his Coſin, iſſued and comming from
the ſecond brother.
                  All this ſheweth ſufficiently, that the Crowne of
Bohemia ought to be holden for Electiue and not hereditary.
As to the limitation that the Emperour alledgeth
thereto, as if the liberty to chuſe the Kings of
Bohemia ought not to be extended out of the houſe
of Auſtria, as long as there be Princes of the ſaid houſe
liuing. This is a pretenſion which hitherto cannot be
debated and decided by any other way, then that of
fact, in the which neither reaſon nor equity can haue
place: for although the Eſtates of Bohemia haue choſen
this many yeares for their Kings ſome of the Archdukes
of Auſtria (which is the ſecond of their grounds)
it doth not enſue thereof, that this continuance of
theirs doth import or make a preſcription of time,
ſince that the Reuerſalls of euery one of them haue
beene as many praecautions, to ſtop and hinder ſuch
pretenſions, euen as the Princes Electors haue neuer

yet auowed vnto the ſaid Archdukes any ſucceſſion
hereditary in the Empire, though that for many yeares
they haue in like manner choſen the Emperours out
of that family.
                  Now it remaineth to touch in one word as it were
by the way, the reception of the Emperor that now is,
vnto the Crowne of Bohemia. In the yeare 1616. the
Archduke Maximilian ſeriouſly repreſented vnto the
Emperor Matthias his brother, by a memoriall dated
the 16. day of February, how much it imported and
concerned the houſe of Auſtria, that his Maieſtie
ſhould be affured in his life time, eſpecially of a ſucceſſor
in the Empire; as alſo in the Realmes of Hungary
and Bohemia, that he could not propoſe a perſon more
capable and fit, then his Couſin Perdinand the Archduke,
and that he had already treated with his brother
Albert the Archduke, for to obtaine his conſent, that
he ought to ſeeke all the meanes he could, to diſpoſe
the Eſtates of Bohemia, & them of Hungary, vnto the
deſignation of his aforeſaid Coſin: that it was needfull
for his Maieſtie to ſpeake himſelfe with the Elector of
Saxony, to gaine and purchaſe his voyce and ſuffrage
in his fauour; that the three Eccleſiaſticall Electors
were for their part enclined thereto already, and that
afterward it behoued him to call a Dyet, in ſome conuenient
place, to make an ouerture of ſuch a ſucceſſion
Imperial, & to proceed with plurality of voices, though
the Elector Palatine & he of Brandemburg would not
yeeld thereto: and for to doe this, to keepe an Army afoot
within the Empire, vnder the pretext of the war
which his ſaid Coſin had at that time in Iſtria againſt
the Venetians, and aduiſe him to effectuate his other

purpoſes and determinations which had beene put in
deliberation betweene them: but aboue all things, that
he tooke great heede that this aduice was not vented
and diſcloſed before the time. This counſell was approued
and receiued by the Emperour Mathias, and
ſoone after divulged and communicated vnto the Elector
of Saxony, and ſundry Princes of the Empire,
but that did not impeach and hinder the effects at all,
for incontinent, ſome began to worke the affaire in
Bohemia, by practiſes, corruptions, and menaces, as
the Eſtates haue largely declared in their Writings,
the Archduke Ferdinand was deſigned King of Bohemia:
the Emperour went vnto the Elector of Saxony
to Dreſden, and alſo called an aſſembly at Ratisbon.
                  At the ſame inſtant that the Electors prepared them
ſelues for the ſaid Aſſembly of Ratisbon, they receiued
newes that the Eſtates of Bohemia, driuen to impatience
by ſo many violences and oppreſſions, continually
and inceſſantly made againſt them, had caſt
downe headlong out of the window of the Councell
Chamber two of the principall Officers of the Emperour,
and a Secretary for many great reaſons by them
deduced and publiſhed, which to be ſhort, are, That
they were conuinced by their owne Letters and Writings,
to haue betrayed their owne Countrey, and
ſerued as inſtruments to depreſſe the ſaid Eſtates, and
to depriue them of their Religion, liberty, felicity, and
happineſſe.
                  The Emperour Mathias being offended with this
procedure of the Eſtates, ſent his Armies into Bohemia,
for to take reuenge thereof, and they ſtood vpon
the defenſiue, whereon enſued a pernicious warre.
                  
                     
The Elector Palatine, after the commencement of
theſe troubles, ſent his Embaſſadours vnto the Emperour,
to requeſt him to giue peace vnto his Realme,
whereby to preuent the ruine of that Countrey, and
other inconueniences; but in vaine: for anſwere was
made by ſome, that his Maieſtie in reputation could
not permit ſuch an affront to goe vnpuniſhed.
                  The Archduke Ferdinand, at that time defigned
King of Bohemia, was reſident and abiding at the
Court of the Emperour Matthias at Vienna, who
for his great debilitie and weakneſſe meddled not
much with the affaires of Eſtate, but all was directed
by Ferdinand.
                  
                  A little while after the Emperour deceaſed, and the
Elector of Mayheme called an Aſſembly of the Electors
at Francfort, for the election of another Emperour,
and called thither (as I haue ſaid) the Archduke
Ferdinand, as King and Elector of Bohemia: The
Eſtates of Bohemia ſent thither their Embaſſadours
alſo, for to proteſt, and to make their exceptions againſt
the ſaid Archduke Ferdinand, whom they ſaid
they could not acknowledge for King: but the Electors
Eccleſiaſticall would not by any meanes ſuffer
them to enter into the Towne, much leſſe giue them
audience, and heare their griefes; alledging, that it
was a particular buſineſſe, and that by the authoritie
of the Golden Bull, it was not lawfull to treat of any
other Affaire in ſuch an Aſſembly, as that which
concerned the election of the Emperor: the which
excuſe had ſome faire apparence outwardly, but if
it were well and narrowly ſeene into, and marked, it
was erroneous, in the regard of the Eſtates of Bohemia;

for they maintained, that the Archduke Ferdinand
ought not to be admitted vnto the Colledge of Electors;
and that therefore it was not a matter particular,
but a point concerning all the Electors, and in generall
all the bodie of the Empire.
                  The ſaid Embaſſadours not obtaining hearing, and
Audience, returned without doing any thing, and
Ferdinand was receiued into the Colledge of Electors
by the haſtie promotion of the three Electors Eccleſiaſticall;
which thing imported the Eſtates of Bohemia
to take the reſolution to reiect Ferdinand. The
Abdication was made in a ſolemne manner; and
ſome few dayes after, the Eſtates paſſed vnto a new
Election.
                  The cauſes of the ſaid Abdication are found, and
are extant, with all the Circumſtances, in the Booke of
the Deduction (made by the Eſtates) and be very many,
of the which I will recite ſome few as briefely and
ſuccinctly as poſſibly may be: The Eſtates affirmed,
That Ferdinand did violate his Oath, and his Reuerſalls,
in that during the life of the Emperor Matthias,
hee intruded himſelfe, and meddled in the affaires of
Bohemia: That he carryed himſelfe like an enemie toward
them: That hee gaue authoritie and gaue order
to make warre againſt them: That he ſollicited the Eſtates
of Morauia to giue paſſage vnto the Armie of
the Emperor: That he himſelfe cauſed his Troupes to
come out of Styria, and ſent them into Bohemia: And
that in their greateſt neceſſities he would not fauorize
them with one good word toward the Emperour,
though they had requeſted him inſtantly in their often
Letters ſo to doe; but that, vnto the contrary, he hath

made them ſeele the effects of his euill will and mallice
in ſundry matters: That after the death of the Emperor,
in ſtead of reſtoring peace vnto them, and of taking
due notice of the bad comportments of the ſaid
Officers, to doe iuſtice thereof, hee hath written vnto
them, and that by his Letters, as by manner of approbation,
and ratification of their offences, he hath reſtored
and put them againe into their Offices and Charges,
ſending vnto them from time to time the confirmation
of the Priuiledges of the ſaid Eſtates, for to
receiue them at their hands: which thing the ſaid Eſtates
could not doe, for that after ſo many euill offices
and acts of hoſtilitie, and rigorous demonſtrations of
Ferdinand, they had need of an aſſecuration better
founded then on a ſimple Writing. To all the which
motiues, and many others, they adioyned the tranſaction
Clandeſtine, made by Ferdinand with Fhilip the
third, King of Spaine, the ſixt of Iune, 1617. By the
which it is treated, concluded, and decreed betweene
them, of a Succeſſion hereditarie, and of the continuation
of the ſame, firſt in the family of Ferdinand, and
afterward in the family of the King of Spaine, according
to the agreements and conditions, as appeareth
in the ſaid tranſaction more at large: Which was
kept very ſecret, and concealed from the Eſtates
of Bohemia, till after the deſignation of Ferdinand,
but it was afterward of it ſelfe diſcouered by another
meanes. And in as much, that it taketh away
from the ſaid Eſtates the libertie to elect, (giuing
vnto them Kings, by way of intruſion, without
their knowledge and aduice) and ouerthrowing as
much as it can, the Lawes Fundamentall, vnto the

obſeruation of the which, all the precedent and former
Kings haue beene bound by ſolmne Oath;
they inferre, that by the ſame, and by his other
deeds aforeſaid, Ferdinand is made incapable of the
Crowne.
                  After this Abdication, the Eſtates of Bohemia
founding and relying vpon their ancient Rights, Priuiledges,
and Liberties, proceeded ſome few dayes
after vnto the election of another King: and ſome
hauing giuen their Suffrages to diuerſe Princes, they
choſe by the moſt voyces, and proclaymed the Elector,
Fredericke the fift, Count Palatine, for their
King. This was on the 16. or 26. of the moneth of
Auguſt: and on the next day, being the 17. or 27. of
the ſaid moneth, the Archduke Ferdinand was choſen
and declared Emperour by the Colledge of Electors,
at that time being aſſembled at Francfort, as is alreadie
ſaid.
                  The ſaid Eſtates gaue notice incontinent vnto the
Elector Palatine (by a perſon ſent vnto him of purpoſe)
of this his Election, approued and ratified by all
the Eſtates of the Prouinces incorporated, requiring
and earneſtly beſeeching him to accept it: which
thing he did not at the firſt, but called together a great
part of his friends and allyes, and ſent Embaſſadours
vnto them who were further off, to haue their aduiſe;
in which ſpace of time, the Eſtates redoubled their
moſt humble inſtances, by their often and iteratiue
Letters, and finally, ſent vnto him into his own Countrey
a ſolemne Embaſſade, compoſed of the Deputies
of euery Prouince, for to preſent the Crowne vnto
him, and to diſpoſe him to accept it, as he did.
                  
                     
One may then ſee by this veritable and irrefragable
information, that the intention of the Prince Palatine
hath not beene to intrude, nor thruſt in himſelfe by
force, nor by practiſe into the Kingdome of Bohemia,
much leſſe to thruſt any other, out of that which was
due or appertained vnto him, but that hee friendly
and without doubt belecued by the circumſtances abone
mentioned, and other moſt pregrant reaſons already
ſet downe in other places, That the Crowne vnto
him ſo ſolemnly offered, was totally vacant, and his Election
very lawfull. Alſo there hath not bin any other
marke or but in the accepting of the Crowne, for no
other cauſe, but to ſuccour the oppreſſed, to preuent
the ruine of the Realme, and to hinder that it ſhould
not fall into the hands of a S
                        •
                     ranger, vnto the great
diſaduantage of the Empire: And for that the effects
had fallen out otherwiſe, we ought to remi
                        •
                      the iudgment
vnto God the director of all things, who will
diſpoſe of them as ſhall ſeeme good vnto him.
               
            
            
               Touching the ſeco
                     •
                  d head.
               FOr to vnderſtand the diference and controuerſie
the better, it is good to vnderſtand and know well
the quality of the ſubiect or matter, and the quality
of the perſons.
               The ſubiect of the controuerſie, is the Realme and
Electorate of Bohemia, the which as it is ſaid, for theſe
many former ages to this time, hath beene holden to
goe by Election, and though it hold in fee of the Empire,
yet it doth not appertaine immediatly vnto the

Emperours no more then the Electors, as well Sec
                     •
                  
                  lars
as Eccleſiaſtiques, and many other as well Electiues
as hereditaries, appertaine not in propriety vnto
the Emperours, for there hath beene many Emperours
of Germany, that haue not been Kings of Bohemia,
and that the Electors are not bound by any
meanes to chuſe the King of Bohemia for Emperour.
Alſo, he hath its priuate or perticular lawes, and is not
in any thing ſubiect vnto the conſtitutions of the Empire:
and likewiſe the Archduke of Auſtria, after the
battaile of Prague haue begun to maintaine publiquely
as well by their pen, as by their ſword, that the ſaid
Realme and Electorate doth appertaine partieulerly
vnto their houſe in propriety. It alſo appeareth by the
tranſaction of Spaine, mentioned before in the firſt
head, that the Archduke Ferdinand now Emperor, attributeth
particulerly to him and his ſonne, not as
Emperour, but as in the quality of Archduke, in the
which yet there is one remarke very conſiderable; to
wit, that after the 
                     ••
                  aking of the ſaid Tranſaction, vnto
the day of his deſignation, made by the authority of
the Eſtates of Bohem
                     •
                  , he durſt neuer vſurpe the title
of King, nor make any mention vnto them of any ſuch
agreements or couenant, 
                     •
                  nowing too well, that for
that the ſame was directly contrary to their priuiledges
and rights of free Election they would haue oppoſed
themſelues, and neuer receiued him: So that
the queſtion, if the Crowne be Electiue or hereditary,
is not debated with the Eſtates of Bohemia by the
Emperour, in the quality of Emperour, but as Archduke.
               Likewiſe one cannot ſay, that by the reiection of

the Archduke Ferdinand, the Eſtates haue reiected
the perſon of an Emperour, for that then the Empire
was vacant, and without Emperour, he comming afterward
to the Imperiall dignity; yea and more, if in
that ſame very time, the body of the Empire had from
it ſelfe offended with ſuch a Reiection, the iudgement
had no
                     •
                   belonged vnto the Archduke Ferdinand, but
rather vnto the Elector Frederick, as chiefe Vicar of
the Empire, repreſenting in that time the perſon of
the Emperour: And therefore it followeth, that the
ſaid Reiection is an act particuler, which doth no
                     •
                  
touch the perſon of the Emperour, nor the body or
corpes of the Empire, who neuer at any time medled
or had to doe with the affaires betweene the Kings,
and the Eſtates of Bohemia: now if ſo be that the
Reiection is a particuler act, ſo alſo is the new
Election which enſued the ſame a little while after,
an act particular, of the like nature and condition.
               So then, if the Eſtates of Bohemia cannot be accuſed
to haue committed the haynous crime of Treaſon,
againſt the perſon of an Emperour, nor againſt the
corps or body of the Empire, by ſuch an Abdication
and new Election: what reaſon is there to accuſe the
Elector Palatine Frederick, of Treaſon in the higheſt
degree, for that hee hath accepted the ſaid Election.
               And it is an obiection very abſurd, to alledge, as
ſome of the other ſide haue done, that the Archduke
Ferdinand, and the Emperour Ferdinand, is but one
perſon, and that hee who reiecteth the Archduke, reiecte
                     •
                  h
the Emperour. This is not but one and

the ſame body, which doth neuertheleſſe repreſent diuers
perſons, and it hath beene already ſaid, that when
the Archduke Ferdinand was reiected, there was no
Emperour Ferdinand at all. The King of Denmarke
is Duke of Holſtein, and becauſe of that Dutchie, hee
is a member of the Empire, hauing a place of ſitting
amongſt the Princes of the Empire, and yet the ſaid
ſitting doth not repreſent the King of Denmarke, but
onely and ſeperately the perſon of a Duke of Holſtein,
inferiour to many other Princes of the Empire.
The King of Spaine is compriſed amongſt the Eſtates
of the Empire, by reaſon of his Prouinces of haſe
Burgundy, and yet is not therefore admitted in the
Seſſions of the Eſtates of the Empire, in quality of
King of Spaine. The Emperour himſelfe maketh vſe
of this diſtinction; For when complaint is made, that
he vſeth the people of the King of Spaine, and bringeth
ſtrange Souldiers into the Empire againſt the ordinance
                     •
                  
of the Empire, and his owne Capitulation:
he anſwered, that he made vſe of the Duke of Burgundy,
and of his aſſiſtance, as of a Prince of the Empire
though yet that he is holpen in this aſſiſtance of the
money and meanes of all his Realmes, and not of his
Prouinces of Burgundy onely: So the Emperour
made not long ſince a like diſtinction about the King
of Denmarke, ſaying in his anſwere to his Ambaſſadour,
that the King of Denmarke could not helpe nor
aſſiſt the circle of the lower Saxony, as King of Denmarke,
but onely as a Duke of Holſtein.
               It is very true that the Palatine Elector is accuſed
by ſome, not onely for that hee hath accepted the
Crowne of Bohemia, but alſo for that hee hath made

an Hoſtile inuaſion into the territory and dominion
of Auſtrich, and by that meanes violated the publique
peace of the Empire: but that is manifeſtly falſe, for
euery one knoweth that it is not he, but the houſe of
Auſtria, who haue kindled the warre in Bohemia, and
conſtrained the Eſtates of Bohemia, to put and ſtand
vpon the defenſiue: and God, (before the entry of
him into Bohemia,) hauing bleſſed their Armes ſo
farre forth, as to repulſe the Counteſſe of Bucquoy,
and of Dampiere with their Armies, and driuen them
backe into Auſtria, from whence they were come, to
inuade and make great hauock in Bohemia, they were
obliged (and ſo they thought themſelues) vpon compulſion
to keepe their forces and Armies within the
ſaid Countries and Dominions of Auſtria, thereby to
impeach their enemies, for comming and getting
within the Realme of Bohemia, and it was not in the
power of the Elector Palatine, to make them retire and
goe backe, although he deſired it neuer ſo much, foraſmuch
as that had beene to expoſe the ſaid Eſtates,
into the danger to ſee themſelues againe incontinently
aſſayled, within their owne borders and confines,
by their ſaid enemies, euen as they had without that
beene very ſhortly after.
               But as concerning the perſons, who be at controuerſie
for this affaire and buſineſſe of Bohemia, euery
one of them hath without compariſon his more eminent
qualities peculiar to himſelfe. But not to ſtay
here to deſcribe that of the Emperor, who is the head
and chiefe of all the Electors, Princes, and Eſtates of
the Empire, whoſe perſon is ſacred, and ought after
God to be honoured and reſpected aboue all others.

It is ſufficient to know, that the Empire is not an Eſtate
Monarchique, where the Prince ruleth abſolutely,
and that the Emperours doe not inherite their
dignities and authorities, but that they be conferred
vpon them, by the hands of the Electors, who, when
they ſhall abuſe themſelues therein, haue the like power
to depriue them, that they had to giue it them,
euen as it is verified by the fundamentall lawes, and
by the examples of the depoſition by them made at
other times, of the Emperours choſen by them.
Alſo it is found in the auncient Letters and documents
of Germany, that the Emperours be called ſoueraigne
Adminiſtrators and Tutors of the Empire,
whereby is gathered and collected, that they cannot
attribute the propriety thereof vnto themſelues,
nor diſpoſe thereof abſolutely according to their
owne fantaſie, but that they are obliged and bound
to yeeld and render an account, and reckoning of
their adminiſtration. And on the other ſide, the
Princes Electors be called by the conſtitutions of the
Empire, and by the Imperiall Capitulation (which
is holden for a fundamentall law) the principall Colomnes
of the Empire, they hauing as Ephori, ſuperintendencie
and ouerſight ouer all the body or
corpes of the Empire, and bee alſo obliged, by
the duty of their Offices, to maintaine, in all, and
through all, the obſeruation of the ſaid Conſtitutions.
               They haue a Colledge apart from others, and
may aſſemble and meete whenſoeuer they thinke
good, to entreate of affaires of State, and bee furniſhed
and endued with (as be alſo the other Princes

and Eſtates reſpectiuely) with many priuiledges, and
immunities, which are confirmed by euery Emperour,
whenſoeuer and as often as they chuſe and elect
and Emperour: before all other things, they preſcribe
vnto him the conditions, vpon which, they put the
Scepter in his hand, and make him to promiſe by a
corporall and ſolemne oath, the obſeruation of them,
and after that, they reciprocally doe vnto him the
oath of fidelity, as to their chiefe head and ſuperiour
by them choſen, of their franke and free will: By
which it appeareth, that there is a very great difference
betweene the Emperours, and the Electors,
and betweene the Kings Soueraignes by nature or
birth, and the Princes and Lords to them immediately
Subiects.
               And eſpecially the Prince Palatine hath dignities
of great eminencie, which are allotted vnto
him pecnliarly, by the Golden Bull. Firſt, in that,
when the Empire happeneth to be vacant, by the
death of the Emperour, or that the Emperour tranaileth
out of the Empire, hee then is to haue the
adminiſtration of the affaaires of the Empire, in the
Countries of the Rhine, of Sueuia, and of the law
Franconien. Secondly, in that by the ſame Golden
Bull, he is conſtituted and ordained Iudge of the Emperor:
when a third perſon hath any different or controuerſie
with him, in the occurrences concerning the
Empire.
               Neuertheleſſe, for all this, hee doth not leaue to
acknowledge the Emperour that now is, for his head,
and ſuperiour, choſen and confirmed in this dignity,

by the plurality of the Electorall voyces: he doth not
diſpute any thing whatſoeuer appertaining vnto the
ſaid Imperiall dignity; Hee (as hee from the beginning
hitherto hath done) doth offer and declare publiquely
to account and reſpect him for ſuch, and in
that quality to giue him all honour, reuerence, and obedience,
conformable and agreeable vnto the Conſtitutions
of the Empire.
               The Crowne of Bohemia in controuerſie betweene
them is, (as it is apparant and euident by the aforeſaid
proofes) a particuler difference, or controuerſie,
which is in queſtion, not as betweene an Emperour
and an Elector, but as betweene two Princes of the
Empire, of the which in this action, the one neither
can nor ought to haue preheminence aboue the other,
but haue neede of a Iudge impartiall, ſuch as the Emperour
that now is, with the Colledge of Electors
might be, if he were not intereſſed in the ſame, as party
principall: And as for the Electors, the moſt part
of them bee, from the beginning of theſe troubles,
made ſuſpected, and incapable to interpoſe their
iudgement: For firſt, and to begin, the three Eccleſiaſticall
Electors fauourizing the Archduke Ferdinand,
euen from before his Election Imperiall, would
not by any meanes heare the griefes of the Eſtates of
Bohemia againſt the ſaid Archduke, when they ſent
for that purpoſe their Ambaſſadors, vnto the Colledge
of Electors, at that time aſſembled at Franckfort, (as
hath been ſaid) but reiecting them, as comming about
a particular difference (though by reaſon of the Electorate
annexed vnto that Crowne, all the ſaid Colledge,

yea, the generalitie of the Empire hath intereſt
therein) neyther ceaſed they, vntill the ſaid Archduke
was brought into the Conclaue of the Electors, as Elector
of Boheme. It is very true, that after this Introduction,
and Election Imperiall, which enſued
thereupon, the Emperour that now is, remitted and
gaue ouer the deciſion of this Affaire vnto the arbitrage
of all the Electors, who aſſigned a day and place
vnto the ſaid Eſtates of Bohemia, for to treat thereof.
But they would not then ſubmit and yeeld themſelues
thereunto, foraſmuch as the matter was not
now entire, and in the ſame eſtate it was, for that
the ſaid Electors, by the ſaid bringing and introduction
of him into the Colledge of the Electors, had giuen
an aduantage vnto their counter-partie. Where
it is to bee remarked, that as well in the ſaid Introduction
as in the Election of the Emperour, the Elector
Palatine did by his Embaſſadors make an expreſſe
reſeruation for the ſaid Eſtates of Bohemia, of
their right that did belong vnto them. As concerning
that after the acceptation of the ſaid Crowne of Bohemia
by the Elector Palatine, the ſaid three Electors
Eccleſiaſticall, and the Elector of Saxony, wrote from
their Aſſembly holden at Mulhauſen, as well vnto the
ſaid Eſtates, as to the ſaid Elector Palatine, and others,
that it appertained vnto them as Electors, to
take knowledge of that fact, as of an Affaire of the
Empire; there is a contradiction to be found therein:
for at Francfort, the three Eccleſiaſticall Electors
declared, That they held the griefes and pretenſions
of the ſaid Eſtates for a particular fact, and would
not by any meanes, that it ſhould be decided by the

Colledge of Electors: yea, which is more, they wrote
vnto the Elector Fredericke, which at that ſame time
was in the high Palatinate, to pray him to come in perſon
to Francfort; and amongſt other points of their
Letters, openly declared, That they would neuer ſuffer
the Eſtates of Bohemia to diſpute or queſtion Ferdinand
about the Crowne of Bohemia: How could they
then, in the interpoſition of their authoritie, vpon that
difference, auoid the ſuſpition of partialitie? Alſo it
is to no purpoſe, to alleage in this difference the authoritie
of the Emperor, to better and gaine the ſuit;
for the authoritie Imperiall, which the Archduke Ferdinand
hath obtained after his abdication in Bohemia,
hath not meliorated his particular cauſe, or made it
more iuſt. For example, if two Souldiers goe to Law,
or contend for ſome Debt, or ſome other Quarrell, and
if that one of them is made Captaine, and hath obtained
authoritie ouer the other, his cauſe is not any way
bettered by this new authoritie. If two Citizens be
at Law for a piece of Land, and if two Princes be in
controuerſie for a Crowne, and one is made Emperour;
ſhall he carrie away the Crowne by his new Imperiall
authoritie? Or elſe is it not lawfull in all cauſes
for an inferior to pretend any right in a particular fact
againſt his ſuperior? Behold then, as concerning the
difference and controuerſie of Bohemia; the deciſion
of which, the Prince Elector Palatine hath beene alwayes,
and is, readie to remit, eyther to a Sentence of
vnpartiall Iuſtice, or to the Arbitrage of eminent perſons,
capable of the cauſe, and not adherent and leaning
vnto the other partie alone.
            
            
               
               Touching the third Head.
               NOw that wee haue heretofore made it apparant,
and euident, by the qualitie of the Controuerſie,
and other circumſtances, that the
Emperour could not interpoſe therein his Imperiall
authoritie, to his owne proper aduantage, and to the
preiudice of the Prince Elector Palatine; this concluſion
followeth thereon, without contradiction,
that the Proſcription is praecipitated, and vnlawfully
done: The which is deduced, ſhowne, and prooued
ſo apparantly, in many other Writings publiſhed,
that it ſhould be ſuperfluous to make any great or
long diſcourſe; but it ſufficeth to adde in this
place ſome example and inſtance of the euident
Nullities which are found in the ſaid Proſcription.
               Firſt, the Emperour (from the beginning) bore
himſelfe as Demaundant and Plaintife againſt the
Prince Palatine, and in ſtead of purſuing him by
the way of vnpartiall Iuſtice, hee hath purſued
him with all Hoſtilitie, with Fire and Sword,
ſhewing by all ſort of violence, that his principall
Butt and Marke was no other, but to reuenge
himſelfe, and to ruinate the other vtterly,
as by his Letters and Writings, as well particular
as publique, and aboue all things, the effects
which haue enſued thereof, haue verified,
that ſuch haue beene his Deſignes. Hee could
not then bee Iudge and Partie at one time,

much leſſe could hee pronounce the Sentence, that
ſhould be vnpartiall, and exempt from the appetite of
bitter reuenge.
               Secondly, the Emperour hath commenced this
Proces, to wit, by the execution, and the afore-mentioned
Hoſtilities, without citation, without iudiciall
recognition of the cauſe, and without hearing the defence
of the Prince Palatine.
               Thirdly, the proſcription hath beene precipitated,
and publiſhed, againſt the Conſtitutions of the Empire,
without the aduice and approbation of the Electors
ioyntly: For though that this Arreſt and Decree
hath beene deliberated on with the knowledge
and conſent of the Eccleſiaſticall Electors; ſo it is,
that that which was done, was done in particular and
in hugger mugger, the ſecular Electors neuer giuing
their conſent thereunto: Neyther was the reſolution
of the ſame taken Collegiately, for it was taken in the
houſe of the Count of Ogniate, Embaſſadour of
Spaine, at Vienna, as it appeareth by the Letters of
the ſaid Count of Ogniate; and information is had
thereof by other meanes alſo.
               For the fourth, it is founded partly vpon certaine
ancient Conſtitutions of the Empire, made againſt
the breakers of the publique peace, who would not
ſubmit themſelues vnto Iuſtice, nor be reduced vnto
Peace, except they were conſtrayned by force of
Armes. The ſaid Conſtitutions doe not any way
touch the Prince Palatine, for that hee did not rayſe
the Warre in Bohemia, and meddled not therein,
but for their defence; being alwayes readie (as hath
beene ſaid) to vndergoe the deciſion of his Cauſe,

eyther by way of Iuſtice, or by an vnpartiall interpoſition:
And as to the authority abſolute, to proſcribe
a Prince Elector without the vniuerſall conſent of the
Electors, without recognition of the cauſe, without
citation, and without the hearing of the iuſtification
of the party accuſed, that is in one word a thing neuer
heard of in the Empire. And though that the Emperour
had had ſuch an authority abſolute, and that it
had beene founded vpon the ſaid Conſtitutions: ſo it
is, that hee cannot make any vſe of it without infringing
the Capitulation, and his oath, which is quite
contrary, as it apparantly and euidently appeareth, by
the enſuing extraict of the 25. and 26. Articles of the
ſaid Capitulation of the clauſe, compriſed in the 28
Article, and of the laſt Article.

                  ALL the other Articles of the ſaid Capitulation
doe containe alſo conditions and promiſes, ſo
aduantageous vnto the Electors, Princes, and
Eſtates of the Empire, that it is impoſſible to make as
much as any one of them valuable or of force, to cloke
or palliate the leſt that may be of the iniuſtice of the
ſaid Proſcription, except that any one will hold and
maintaine, that the ſolemne oath madeby his Maieſty
Imperiall in the confirmation of them, is not obligatory,
and that in reading the ſaid conditions and promiſes,
one ought to vnderſtand them contrary to the
words ſet downe.
                  Behold, I ſay, ſome ſcantlings of the Nullities of the
ſaid Proſcription; for the reſt of the things that are
defectiue in the ſame, I remit you vnto the Treatiſes
and deductions, more amply ſet downe in print, and
publiſhed vnto the world.
                  And beſides the ſaid Nullities, the text of the Proſcription
is farced, and ſtuffed, with many falſe narrations,
by the which, ſome labour to deingrate the
Prince Palatine, and to make him more odious, and
to giue ſome colour of Iuſtice vnto this vniuſt proceedings:
For hee is accuſed to haue practiſed with
the Turke, and to haue expoſed thereby Chriſtendome,
vnto extreame danger, the which calumnious
ſlaunder is drawne out of that, that the Eſtates of
Hungary and Bohemia, conioyntly with the Prouinces
incorporated, ſent in the yeare 1620. an
Ambaſſade vnto Conſtantinople. But it is not enough
to accuſe him, but it is reaſon rather to haue
proofes: the depeach and the inſtruction of the
ſaid Embaſſade (the counter-partie whereof is in

mens hands) ſheweth the quite contrarie. And ſince
that they of the other partie dare not ſhew, nor publiſh
it, becauſe that the ſaid ſlander cannot be verified
thereby, the good compatriotes haue cauſed it not
long ſince to bee publiſhed, and imprinted, that it
might bee communicated vnto all the World, who
may ſee by the ſame, that the Butt and end of the ſaid
Embaſſade was for no other end and purpoſe, then
to obtaine a firme peace with that puiſſant Neighbour,
and Borderer, and redoutable Enemie of Chriſtendome,
and by that meanes to impeach and diuert
him, to make vſe and benefit of thoſe occaſions
that the vnfortunate Warre, rayſed and begun by
them of the Houſe and Family of Auſtria, preſented
vnto him, of inuading and piercing into the ſaid
Realmes, and Prouinces: And that was done the
more, for that the ſaid Houſe of Auſtria had vnarmed
and disfurniſhed the Fortreſſes and Frontiers of
Hungarie of their Munitions of Warre, for to employ
them againſt the Eſtates of Bohemia, where indeed
they ſhould haue made them to ſerue againſt
the inuaſion of the Turke, vnto the which they were
deſtinate and appointed, and vnto which the Eſtates
of the Empire had contributed, with the expences of
their owne money.
                  Now to giue ſome apparance and colour vnto this
vniuſt Proſcription, the contrarie partie maketh a
great ſhew, with rehearſing the example of the Elector
Iohn Fredericke of Saxonie, who in the yeere
one thouſand fiue hundred fortie ſix, was proſcribed
by the Emperour Charles the fift; by the execution
of the which, hee was deſpoyled of one part of his

Countreyes, and of his Dignitie Electorall, wherewith
the Dukes, Maurice, and Auguſte of Saxonie,
and their deſcendents, were inueſted, with the excluſion
of his three ſonnes, and of his brother. But this
example hath no reſemblance with that of the Prince
Palatine.
                  For firſt, after the declaration of the Ban, hee was
offered a Treatie of Peace, by the entermiſe of the Elector
Fredericke the ſecond, Count Palatine, and of
Doctor Eck, Counſellor of the Emperour Charles the
ſiſt; but hee vtterly refuſed it. On the contrarie, the
Elector Palatine hath ſought by all meanes an equitable
peace, and cannot obtaine it.
                  Secondly, the Elector Iohn Fredericke and his
Confederates made open Warre againſt the Emperour
Charles the fift, whom they would not acknowledge
for Emperour, calling him Charles of Gaunt,
who named himſelfe Emperour; and that which is
more, they ſent him a Cartell, or Letter of Defiance,
and in ſolemne manner renounced the Oath they
had formerly made vnto him. But it hath beene demonſtrated
here before, that the Elector Palatine did
not meddle, nor had any contention with the Emperour
Ferdinand, as with an Emperour, but as
with an Archduke of Auſtria; who, before that hee
came to the Crowne Imperiall, had alreadie commenced
and begun the Warre. And as for the Dignitie
Imperiall, the Elector Palatine hath alwayes
proteſted to recognize him for Emperor; and in this
qualitie, to render and to giue him all obedience and
reſpect, in conformitie vnto the Conſtitutions of the
Empire.
                  
                     
Thirdly, the Elector Iohn Fredericke (at that time
detained and kept priſoner) renounced the foureteenth
day of May, in the yeere of our Lord, one
thouſand fiue hundred fortie and ſeuen, in the Campe
before Wittenberg, for him and his heires, all the
Rights that he could pretend vpon the Electorate of
Saxonie; the which Renunciation was ratified by
his three ſonnes, and his brother: which thing cannot
be ſaid on the behalfe of the Elector Palatine.
And though that the example of the Elector Palatine
may not be compared and reſembled with the
example of the Elector Iohn Fredericke of Saxonie:
(betweene the which, there is as much difference notwithſtanding,
then there is betweene Summer and
Winter) ſo it is, that there is not any that can iuſtifie
the ſaid pretended Proſcription, for that the Emperour
which is now at this day, is obliged and bound
by his Capitulation confirmed by his corporall Oath,
not to doe the like thereafter.
                  Since that then the Iniuſtice of the Proſcription
precipitated againſt the Prince Palatine, is ſo vniuſt,
it will not be amiſſe to ſee and view alſo the Iniuſtice,
or more rather, enormious exceſſe of the Execution.
                  The Execution hath beene commenced a good
ſpace of time before the publication of the Sentence;
and as well before, as after, the Palatinate hath beene
made the Scaffold, vpon the which hath beene played
the moſt horrible, the moſt cruell, and the moſt deteſtable
Tragedies, that euer any man heard or ſaw,
ſince the Empire had the Name of Chriſtian.
Some pretend, that the Prince hath offended,

and for it the people haue beene puniſhed. Theſe
poore innocent Countreyes haue beene expoſed in
prey vnto forraine and ſtrange Nations, Coſſaques,
Croatians, and other Barbarians, who vnder the ſacred
Name of the Emperour, haue pilled, ſaccaged,
rauaged, maſſacred them, and burned their habitations
and houſes; in ſuch ſort, that the Heauens doth
bemoane and feele the ſobbes and groanes of manie
thouſand Chriſtian ſoules, that neuer had any knowledge,
and much leſſe of partaking in the Affaires of
Bohemia: The Ayre is yet obſcured and darkened
with the ſmoake of ſo many Townes, Villages, Boroughes,
Caſtles, Houſes, and Hamlets, burned and
conſumed with Fire; and the Earth is yet all moiſt,
and dyed (as it were) with a deluge of bloud, at the
which the liuing haue horror, and the poſteritie will
haue deteſtation. Theſe poore innocents are brought
vnder the yoake of a perpetuall miſerie: there is carryed
away out of the Palatinate a great number of
perſons, women and children, into ſtrange Countries;
of the which, ſome haue beene barbarouſly ſold vpon
the frontiers of Turkie: And in moſt parts of the
Palatinate▪ theſe wretched ſoules are dayly depriued
of the exerciſes of their Religion, that not onely the
ſolace of their bodies is taken from them, but they
are alſo depriued of the conſolation of their ſoules.
The Countrey is diſmembred, the Territories are diuided,
and the Subiects are conſtrained and enforced
to doe homage vnto ſtrangers. The little that remaineth
of their goods, is confiſcated; and eſpecially,
the goods of Officers and ſeruants of the ſaid Lord
are eſcheated. To be ſhort, there is done all the miſchiefe

and euill, that the mallice of men can deuiſe.
                  And for the execution of all thoſe violences
and exceſſes, the Duke of Bauyer, and thoſe
of the League, haue moſt paſſionately and furiouſly
imployed their Armes; and the doing there
of, doth violate and breake the faith and promiſe
by them giuen and made at the Treatie of Vlmes:
in the which it was accorded and decreed, vnder
the Signature, Letters, and Seales of the ſaid
Duke of Bauyer, That they ſhall not make any
Inuaſion, or Act of Hoſtilitie, within the one or
the other of the two Palatinates, vnder any colour,
name, or pretext, whatſoeuer it was,
nor to meddle with any thing within the ſaid
Palatinates.
                  But that is not all: Theſe Outrages were not
committed onely againſt the Elector Palatine, but
they haue driuen away the Duke of Symmeren,
his brother, out of his Patrimonie, his Countreyes,
Goods, and Reuenues; they haue ruined his ſubiects,
who are yet to this day inceſſantly euill entreated,
and conſumed and impoueriſhed with all
ſort of Exactions, Contributions, and other inſupportable
Charges: And yet hee was neuer accuſed,
much leſſe conuicted of any Crime; yea,
rather the Emperour himſelfe hath declared him to
be innocent.
                  The bordering Countreyes haue not beene
much better dealt withall, and entreated, but extreamely
moleſted, pilled, and rauaged, in diuers

quarters, againſt the Treatie of M

                  And not to ſtand and enlarge ones ſelfe vpon
the particulars, but to deſcend and come
vnto the generalitie; this Proſcription, and
Execution ſo vindicatiue, hath in that manner
afflicted all the Corps and Bodie of the Empire,
that it ſeemeth to be the downefall of its
totall ruine.
                  Moreouer, they were not content to depriue
the Prince Palatine of his Eſtates and Dignities
Electoralls, but they haue alſo depriued his
Children, and Brother, and his other neere Kinſmen,
though they were all Innocents, taking away
from them the benefit of their Inueſtitutes
in Remainder, and Reuerſion, for to giue them
vnto the Duke of Bauyer, in recompence of
ſo much bloud hee hath ſhed, and fire kindled;
and when hee hath put him in the pretended
poſſeſſion of the ſaid Eſtates, and Dignities,
the ſaid Kinſmen and Allyes are put vnto ſuite
together, by way of Law, or by an amiable
Compoſition, to whom they ſhall appertaine

after the death of the Dukes of Bauyer: and you
neuertheleſſe, before the Cauſe come ſo farre, there
are giuen vnto the Duke of Neaburg Letters of
expectancie, for to be preferred thereto, and placed
therein, before all others.
                  The true cauſe of this extraordinarie rigorous
proceedings againſt the Houſe Electorall Palatine,
is clearely expreſſed in the Letters written
by the Emperour vnto Don Balthazar d' Cuiuga,
principall Councellor vnto the King of Spaine,
dated the fifteenth day of October, in the yeere
of our Lord one thouſand ſix hundred twentie
and one, to bee ſeene in the Chancelrie of Spaine
(a Booke ſo called) that is to ſay, That foraſmuch
as they haue heretofore made oppoſition
vnto the Houſe of Auſtria, the which thinketh,
that it cannot extend his domination ſo farre, as
it proiccteth, if that the ſaid Houſe of the Palatine
be not vtterly ruinated.
                  So alſo the tranſlation of the Electorate into
the Houſe of Bauyer, expreſſedly declareth in the
Poſt-ſcript of the ſame Letters, That the Butt
thereof is, that by meanes thereof the Catholique
Romanes may haue more, and pluralitie of Voyces,
in the Colledge of the Electors, and that
the Empire may bee perpetuated in the Houſe
of Auſtria; vnto the aduancement of which, the
Duke of Bauyer ſhall be obliged and bound, for
this great benefit receiued from the Houſe of
Auſtria.

make vſe to further their Affaires, and to bring
them vnto the point where they are ſeene to be
at this day, be ſo many in number, that they
would make a great Booke, to compriſe them
all: The intention of this Information, beeing
onely to demonſtrate a farre off the wrong that
is done vnto the Elector Palatine, and his Children
and Friends.
               
            
            
               Touching the fourth Head.
               IT hath beene ſaid in the firſt Head, That
at the verie beginning of the Troubles of
Bohemia, the Prince Elector Palatine deſirous
to ſee the Peace eſtabliſhed there, and the
Subiects reconciled vnto their King, ſent an Embaſſadour
vnto the Emperour at Vienna, for to
deſire him to vanquiſh himſelfe, to lay downe
Armes, and ſurceaſe from violence, and to quench
the fire of a pernitious Warre at the firſt. But
that was in vaine; for the Embaſſadour continued
his Suit inſtantly many moneths together,
to his great charges, at Vienna; but returned,
and obtayned nothing.
               
                  
After the death of the Emperour Matthias, the
King of great Briraine to teſtifie and witneſſe his
good intentions, toward the publique good of all
Germany, ſent the Vicount Doncaſter, Councellor
in his Councels of Eſtate, and Gentleman of his
Chamber, in Ambaſſade vnto the Archduke Ferdinand,
at that time deſigned King of Bohemia,
and other Princes of the Empire, to mediate an accommodation
betweene the ſaid Ferdinand, and
the ſaid Eſtates of Bohemia, and by this ſweet and
milde way, to reduce and bring the parties vnto
repoſe and reſt, and to preuent the euils which
haue afterward miſerably afflicted, doe afflict, and
will afflict ſtill all the corpes and body of the fift
Empire, yea and of all Chriſtendome, if God by
his grace do not giue a conuenable remedie therevnto.
The ſaid Ambaſſadour met the Archduke
Ferdinand at Ratisbone, in the way for to goe vnto
the Dyet of Franckfort, called for the Election of
a new Emperour: he was giuen to vnderſtand, that
in that place of Ratisbone, the affaires of Bohemia
could not be treated of; and that therefore hee
ſhould returne backe, and goe vnto Franckfort,
where there would be better commodity to conferre
with the Electors, and to take a good reſolution
therein; but he thinking to obtaine ſo much as
to enter into the Towne for that purpoſe, was not
permitted ſo to doe, vnder the pretext and colour,
that it was againſt the Golden Bull, to permit ſtrangers,
Princes, or Ambaſſadours, during the holding
of the ſame Dyet, to enter into the Towne.

So that hee was conſtrayned to withdraw himſelfe
vnto Hanau, and there to ſtay a long time
at great charges and expences, for that hee had
a very great trayne: And though hee requeſted
oftentimes, and with great inſtance to be admitted
and heard; yet hee could not obtayne, vntill
that Ferdinand was brought into the Conclaue
Electorall, and by that meanes choſen Emperour:
And for that the Emperour, after that hee
was come, by his reception vnto the Colledge
Electorall, as King of Bohemia, vnto the marke
hee aymed, had remitted the ſaid affaire and buſineſſe
of Bohemia vnto the Arbitrage of the Electors,
the negotiation of the ſaid Lord Embaſſadour
was made fruſtrate, and hee diſmiſſed to goe
vnto the place from whence he came. Behold here
the firſt affront made vnto the King of great Brittaine
in his interpoſition.
               In the yeare of our Lord, One thouſand ſixe
hundred and twenty: The King of Spaine and
the Archduke Albertus ſet on foote a puiſſant Armie
in the Prouinces of Burgogne, in the moneth
of Iuly and Auguſt, the King of great Brittaine
aduertiſed from other places, that it was to
inuade the lower Palatinate, ſent Sir Edward
Conway and Sir Richard Weſton his Ambaſſadours,
vnto the Archduke at Bruxelles, to exhort him
not to make any inuaſion into the Palatinate, with
offers to interpoſe his good Offices for the aduancement
and furthering of an amiable & friendly
compoſition, vnto whom anſwere was giuen:

                  That the King of Spaine and his Highneſſe had aſſembled
and formed an Army for the ſeruice of the Emperour,
and that as yet the reſolution was not taken, in
what place that Army ſhould he employed. Now it is
a thing to be noted, that the ſaid Army marched
already toward the Palatinate, when that they
made this aunſwere full of mockerie vnto the ſaid
Embaſſadours.
               Incontinently after the publication of the Ban
againſt the Prince Pala
                        ••
                     ne, the Princes and Eſtates
vnited, diſpached their Embaſſadours vnto to beſeech
him to ſuſpend the execution thereof, and to
giue way vnto an accommodation, for to ſtop the
euils that would enſue thereof infallibly, aſſuring
themſelues to diſpoſe the ſaid Prince Palatine vnto
all things that ſhould be thought conuenable and
equitable for the cōmon good and repoſt, but ſuch
anſwer was made vnto them in the Emperors name,
that they might vnderſtand that nothing was entended
and to be looked for, but fire and ſword.
               The King of Denmark alſo beſtowing therein the
ſame offices by his Embaſſadours, was paid with
like money as the Princes and Eſtates vnited were.
               And for that the Prince Elector Palatine had betruſted
all this affaire, in the interpoſition of the
Kings of great Brittaine, and of Denmarke, with
promiſe to ratifie and accompliſh all whatſoeuer,
they concluded or accorded in his name, ſo that
it were not againſt his conſcience or his honour: his
Maieſty of great Britaine (vnto whom he afterward
remitted the negotiation thereof, & granting to do

all that he ſhall iudge moſt fitting, for the recouering
of his Eſtates and dignities, and the re-eſtabliſhment
of a firme peace in the Empire) voluntarily
charged himſelfe with this entermiſe, and
promiſed, as he hath promiſed oftentimes hitherto,
to employ therein all his poſſible meanes, and to
expoſe therein, if neede be, all that God hath giuen
him in this world, iudging it better, notwithſtanding,
it to be the better & more reaſonable to ſearch
and make vſe of the way of mildneſſe, before that
he proceeded vnto extremities.
               This is the matter, why his Maieſtie of Great
Brittaine ſent the Lord Digby, Councellour of Eſtate,
and Gentleman of his Chamber, vnto the
Emperour in the moneth of Iune, with large inſtructions
and power, to labour to bring the affaires
vnto ſome good compoſition. The Archduke Albertus
had then graunted a truce in the lower Palatinate
for ſome weekes, which began to expite, and
the high Palatinate was yet in the hands of the
Prince Palatine, but terribly menaced, and in great
feare, by reaſon of the great preparations of warre
made by the Duke of Bauier, to gaine and winne
the ſame vnder the title of a Commiſſion Imperiall
to him giuen. The Ambaſſadour Digby vſed all his
forces and diligences poſſible for the diſcharge of
his Ambaſſade, dayly redoubling his inſtances toward
his Maieſtie Imperiall, the which declared
that hee deſired nothing more, (then peace, 
                     ••
                   the
Prince Palatine would firſt make ſatisfaction, and
ſubmiſſion, vnto the which was added, ſometime

one thing, and then at another time, another
thing; onely (as the effects teſtified) for to gayne
and winne time, vntill the Truce was expired:
And that the Duke of Bauyer might haue an
occaſion to giue a blow vpon the high Palatinate,
without the impeachment of Count Mansfelt,
who had amazed and gathered together
ſome Troupes, vpon the Frontiers of Bohemia.
The ſaid Truce being expired, the Spaniards recommenced
the Warre in the lower Palatinate,
the Emperour not abiding to giue any eare vnto
the prorogation of the Truce, alledging many
new pretexts: yet neuertheleſſe, his Imperiall
Maieſtie, and they of his Councell, put the ſaid
Embaſſadour in hopes, by faire words, and goodly
promiſes, That the Duke of Bauyer (whoſe
Commiſſion had beene ſuſpended by the order of
the Emperour, at the ſollicitation of the ſaid Embaſſadour)
ſhould not receiue any new Commiſſion,
and ſhould be enioyned not to make hereafter
the execution of the Ban againſt the higher
Palatinate. And finally, vpon the reiterated inſtances
of the Embaſſadour, and vpon certaine
Conditions and Promiſes by him offered, his
Imperiall Maieſtie conſented vnto a Treatie, and
wrote vnto the Infanta of Spaine the eleuenth of
September, giuing her power to agree with the
King of Great Brittaine (if the Affaires in thoſe
Quarters permitted her) and decree with him a
ſuſpenſion or depoſition of Armes, that by that
meanes they might enter into a friendly and amiable

conference of a peace and accommodation.
The Embaſſadour truſting and confiding in all
theſe Declarations, Promiſes, and Words, and
not being able to obtaine more at their hand,
tooke leaue of the Emperour, and made haſt in
his returne, with a purpoſe to bring (by the power
of the Commiſſion giuen vnto the Infanta) his Affaires
to ſome good paſſe. But in his returne he was
aduertiſed, and ſaw himſelfe, that the Duke of Bauyer
was made Maſter of all the whole high Palatinate,
and conſtrained the ſubiects to doe him homage;
whereof he made complaints vnto the Emperor
by his Letters of the fift of October, making
vnto him a remonſtration, that the ſame was done
vnto the preiudice of his Declaration, and againſt
that which his Councellors had giuen him to vnderſtand.
               Being arriued at Bruxels, hee aſſayed and tryed
by all meanes to obtaine a ſuſpenſion of Armes:
which thing was impoſſible, foraſmuch as the
Emperour had commaunded the ſaid Infanta, by
other Letters written (vnknowing vnto the ſaid
Embaſſador) That ſhe ſhould not make any accord
of Truce, and that his Maieſtie Imperiall had inioyned
Don Cordua to proceed: So that the contrarietie
of theſe Letters, diſpatched and ſent at one and the
ſame time, vpon one and the ſame ſubiect, is euidently
diſcouered by the anſwere the Infanta gaue
vnto the Embaſſador, on the eight day of Nouember,
a thouſand ſix hundred twentie and one: which
was done not to loſe, but to follow the aduantage

which the counterpartie had gotten by the occupation
of the high Palatine, and the greateſt part of
the low Palatinate, and that there reſted no more to
take, but Heydelberg Manheym, and Frankendale,
and ſome other ſmall places; to the Conqueſt of
which, the Duke of Bauyer ſent the greateſt part of
his Armie, which ioyned it ſelfe vnto the Spaniards
vnder diuers pretexts: inſomuch, that all the endeuors
that his Maieſtie of Great Brittaine had made
at Bruxels, for to procure ſome ſmall releaſe & eaſe
vnto the poore Palatinate, and to mediate a treatie
of Peace, were as vnprofitable as the precedent, and
former at Vienna: where yet neuertheleſſe was
made all manner of faire ſemblant, and ſeeming to
haue a deſire to giue ſatisfaction vnto his ſaid Maieſtie,
who demanded an entire reſtitution of the
high and low Palatinate, and of the Dignitie Electorall,
for his ſonne in law, who on the other part
promiſed to yeeld vp and ſurrender the Crowne
of Bohemia; and as concerning the ſubmiſſion, to
doe (vnto the which, they on the other ſide inſiſted
ſtrongly, without any intention to accept thereof)
all that which might be done, without preiudice of
the Conſtitutions of the Empire.
               The Armie of the Papiſtique League, and thoſe
of the Spaniards, did extreamely rauage the low
Palatinate: vpon which, the Count Palatine was
conſtrained to goe thither in perſon, and to make
all the reſiſtance poſſible with the Troupes of the
Count of Mansfelt.
               His Maieſtie of Great Brittaine ſeeing that the

enemies reenforced themſelues, and grew ſtrong
dayly, and had enterpriſed to import and to conquer
all the low Palatinate, as well as the high
Countrey; hee thought it good to write vnto the
Emperour by a Corrieur, or Poſt, ſent of purpoſe,
and to offer him, in the behalfe of his ſonne in law,
by his Letters (which were of the twelfth of Nouember,
one thouſand ſix hundred twentie and one)
Conditions of Peace, ſuch as he thought as impoſſible,
that the Emperor (of whoſe pacifique intentions
all men ſpoke) ought or could refuſe them. And
to the end he might lay an aſſured foundation vpon
the ſaid offers, hee ſeriouſly exhorted the Prince Elector
Palatine, his ſonne in law, to ratifie them, and
to promiſe the accompliſhment of them, by an authenticall
Inſtrument, ſigned with his hand, and ſealed
with his ſeale; the which hee did, dated the fiue
and twentieth day of the ſaid moneth of Nouember,
preferring the publike peace and repoſe of Germanie,
before all the particular conſiderations of
himſelfe and his Houſe.
               And though there was no ſpeech in the Court
at Vienna, and that of Bruxels, made vnto the Embaſſadors
and miniſters of the King of Great Brittaine,
of any other thing, then of the pacifique intentions
of the Emperour, and of the reſolution
that he had to giue all ſatisfaction vnto his Maieſtie
of Great Brittaine; ſo it is, that yet he did not accept
the ſaid Conditions, and ſo by the refuſall of
them, diſpenſed the Prince Elector Palatine not to
be bound and obliged therewith, & ſent the Count

of Schwartzenburg into England, onely for to
make all ſort of complement, and gaue a new Commiſſion
vnto the Infanta to treate with the King of
great Brittaine about a ſuſpenſion and laying down
of Armes, and alſo of a peace, and made in that
ſame time, the Warre to be continued in the lower
Palatinate, vnto the Princes and Eſtates Euangeliques
of the Empire he diſſimuled, and would not
be knowne of the ſame conditions; but hee cauſed
them to be communicated vnto the Prince Bethelem
Gabor, who vpon that tooke occaſion to make
peace with the Emperour; whereupon it enſued,
that the greateſt part of the troupes which were in
Auſtria, Bohemia, and other places were ſent into
the lower Palatinate, to make an end of all: notwithſtanding,
his Maieſtie of great Brittaine was
continually aſſured of the reſtitution, and offers
were made of a treaty of peace: to be briefe, promiſes
were made vpon promiſe, and ſo his Maieſty entred
into a new parley, and ſent Sir Richard Weſton
vnto Bruxels to treate with the Infanta, who ordained
and appointed Commiſſioners for that effect
and purpoſe, who for to gaine and winne time, exacted
of the ſaid Embaſſadour a plaine power ſigned
with the hand of the Prince Palatine, to the end
(as they ſaid) they might be aſſured, that he would
ratifie and accompliſh all that they ſhould conclude
and determine: and although that his Maieſtie
had already ſufficient power, vpon many Letters
of his ſonne in law; ſo it is, that they would
ſee a plenipotency or full power informe, that

which his Maieſtie graunted them, and cauſed a
plenipotency or full power to be diſpatched by his
ſaid Emb
                     •
                  ſſadour as well in his owne name, as in
the name of his ſonne in law, who ſigned the ſame
ioyntly with his Maieſty, & ſent the ſame to Bruxels,
where the ſaid plaine power being come, the
Commiſſioners found therein one onely word repeated;
to wit, the title of Elector, which was giuen
vnto the ſaid Prince, and prayed that the ſaid full
power might be reformed and renewed, and that
title put out thereof, alledging that they could not
well treate that title being in: and ſo his Maieſtie
to take away all exceptions, made the ſaid power,
with the omiſſion of that title, to be drawne againe;
but yet with an exception that it ſhould not at any
time preiudice him by any means. Theſe commings
and goings too and fro, cauſed by the contreparty,
were for no other end, but draw out and to prolong
the buſineſſe, and to hinder and empeach, that
his Maieſty (who had already promiſed to entertaine
8000. footmen, and 1600. horſe in the Pala
                  
                     •
                  inate,
at his owne charges,) ſhould not ſend thither
any great ſuccour, not make any diuerſion in Flanders,
nor any where elſe. The ſaid power then hauing
bin made, made againe, ſigned, and ſent the
ſecond time at the inſtances of the ſaid Commiſſioners,
his Maieſty receiued Letters from the Emperour,
written the 18. of Iune, by the which he gaue
him to vnderſtand, that the treaty of peace could
not well be made nor concluded at Bruxels, ſince
that the affaire and buſineſſe concerned & touched
all the Empire, and that therefore he had called an

aſſembly of the Electors, and ſome other Princes at
Ratisbone, remitting and leauing it vnto the good
pleaſure of his Maieſty, if hee would ſend any one
thither on his behalfe. The which contrary and vndue
procedure, his Maieſty tooke as ſtrange, and
thereof made ſharp and bitter complaints vnto the
Emperor in his anſwer. And for that the reſt of the
Palatinate ſtood in danger to be loſt, not being able
to reſiſt ſuch puiſſant enemies, his Maieſty in ſome
manner to breake that blow, tooke into his protection
the Townes of Heydelberg, Manheym, and
Frankendale, but that was no hinderance: for the
two firſt were beſieged & furiouſly battered, Heydelberg
taken by aſſault and pillaged, and that of
Manheym taken by compoſition; ſo that there remayned
none but the Towne of Frankendale only;
for the conſeruation of the which, his Maieſty ſeeing
that it would be left in his protection no more
then the other two, found it good, and at the inſtance
& great promiſes of the Infanta, to ſequeſter
it into her hands, and ſhee gaue the gouernment
thereof vnto Don Verdugo, a Nobleman of Spaine,
who put therein a Gariſon, the which at this day
menaceth inceſſantly the poore Burgeſſes, to pillage
them for want of their payment, though it be
not bound to ſatisfie them for the ſame.
               After the taking & total ruine of the Palatinate,
the Emperor made haſt with the Dyet of Ratisbon,
and was there in perſon, where he inueſted publikely
the Duke of Bauier with the Palatinat Electorall,
to the excluſiō of the children of the brother, & the
neereſt kinſmen of the Prince Palatine (againſt the

aduice and oppoſition of the Electors of Saxony
and of Brandemburg, who preſſed by their Embaſſadours,
the entire reſtitution of his Countries
and dignities) And gaue the King of Great Brittaine
to vnderſtand by his Letters, dated at Raitſbone
the fift of March, one thouſand ſixe hundred
twenty and three, in the which hee added amongſt
other cleare teſtimonies of his great good will toward
his Maieſtie, that his tranſlation of the Electorate
in the houſe of Bauiere, was made with expreſſe
reſeruation, That it ſhall be permitted by eſpeciall
grace vnto the Grand children of his Maieſtie,
and vnto his other kinſmen, to treate hereafter in
ſome Towne Imperiall, as Nuremburg, Angsberg,
Vlm, or Franckfort, touching the right that euery
one of them may pretend in the titles and Dignities
Electoralls: and if ſo be that they cannot agree
and accord together, that it ſhall be lawfull
for them to commence ſute, and enter into proces
before the Maieſtie Imperiall, and the Colledge of
the Electors, where they may aſſure and promiſe
to themſelues a quicke diſpatch, and Iuſtice ſoone
adminiſtred, if they themſelues doe not hinder the
ſame, by ſome act of their owne; by the which reſeruation,
his Maieſtie of Great Brittaine may ſee
the moſt ſincere affection the ſaid Maieſtie Imperiall
bore vnto him, and to his poſterity. This is
the ſubſtance of the ſaide Letters of the Emperour.
               Now let euery one giue his iudgement of this
goodly declaration. And it ought not to be paſſed

in ſilence, that at his departure from the Dyet at
Ratisbone, the Emperour, as it is ſaid, made ſhew
in the ſaid Letters to reſerue vnto the children, brother,
and kinsfolkes of the Prince Palatine, ſome
permiſſion to diſpute the right, that they would
pretend after the Duke of Bauier; promiſed the expectancy
of the Electorate vnto the Duke Wolfgang.
William of Neuburg, confirmed by Letters and
Seales.
               And as the Emperour hath alwayes made proſeſſion
of good will toward the King of Great Brittaine,
and to giue eare vnto the entire reſtitution
which hee hath ſought by friendſhip, and by the
way of amity with great trouble and charge; but
in vaine: So alſo hath the King of Spaine done the
very ſame almoſt, vntill that the Palatinate hath
beene reduced vnto the more then miſerable eſtate,
as it is at this day, and that the Duke of Bauier hath
beene put in full poſſeſſion of all the high, and of
the greateſt part of the lower Palatinate, together
with the dignity Electorall: for though the King
of Spaine hath oftentimes aſſured his Maieſtie of
great Brittaine, as well by his Letters as by his Embaſſadours,
ſeriouſly to co-operate and ioyne with
him, for to obtaine the entire reſtitution of the Palatinate
Electorall, and of that which dependeth
thereof, with an expreſſe promiſe for this effect to
ioyne his Armes with thoſe of his Maieſtie if neede
was: This notwithſtanding, when hee hath beene
finally demaunded by his owne Ambaſſadours, a
ſpeciall declaration by writing, hee hath anſwered,

That he cannot doe it, for that, beſide, that it ſhall
be to depriue him to haue any hand in it, and the
Arbitrage in this affaire, as a mediator or friend,
that it may alſo not onely giue cauſe vnto the Emperour
his Vncle, to take an vnkindneſſe or offence
thereat; but alſo, that if he ſhall mingle threates and
Armes, with the Offices of interpoſition, it ſhall
be an vnkindneſſe and diſ-office in his deportment
which he ought in reaſon to vſe toward his Imperiall
Maieſtie: by the which anſwere it appeareth
euidently, that all the ſaid promiſes of Spaine haue
beene nothing but words.
               For the cloſure of this Information, wee are
moreouer to recount an artifice and cunning trick,
whereof the contrary party doth make vſe; That
is: The Infanta of Spaine vnder the colour and diſguiſe
of an Imperiall Commiſſion, and of an extreame
deſire to re-eſtabliſh peace in the Empire,
and to giue ſatisfaction vnto the King of Great
Brittaine, made a propoſition of certaine Articles
of a truce of fifteene moneths in the lower Palatinate,
and generally for all the Empire, to the end,
that in this ſpace of time a treaty of a firme peace
might be had: So, that his Maieſty, after hee had
changed ſome thing in the ſaid Articles, condiſcended
thereunto, and ſigned them, ſending them
vnto the Prince Elector Palatine, for to ſigne them
alſo; who (after he had deferred a little while to conſent
vnto them, becauſe of the captious Articles he
ſaw in them) vpon the inſtances that were made,
and the hopes that the counterparty made him take

of an accommodation, ſigned them in like manner:
but all that came vnto nothing. For neuer ſince
haue they ceaſed to exerciſe againſt the poore Subiects
of the Palatinate, all ſorts of rigours, and violences;
neither will they obſerue the Articles of
truce, vnder diuers new colours & pretexts forged
and framed out of their owne fantaſies and braines.
The Butt and end of this counterfeited & diſguiſed
truce, was, for that Auſtria and Spaine deſired to
take from the Prince Palatine the power of ſeeking
the ſuccours and aſſiſtance of forraigne Kings and
Princes, and eſpecially to preuent, that (peraduenture)
he ſhould not make vſe of the Forces and Armies,
the Duke of Brunſwick, and Count Manſfelt
had then on foot, and that by that occaſion the
Prince Bethelem Gabor ſhould not take occaſion to
make any inuaſion againſt the Houſe of Auſtria.
But at that ſame time, the Armie of the Duke of
Brunſwick hauing been put to rout and defeated by
a fatall deſtinie, Auſtria and Spaine ſeeing thēſelues
come to that Butt they ſhot at, made a mockerie of
the ſaid Truce, & continuated their Hoſtilities, and
a little after departed, and deliuered vnto the Archbiſhop
of Mentz the Country of Bergſtrate (which
is one of the beſt Prouinces of the Palatinate) for to
oblige him ſo much the more ſtrictly to maintaine
and defend their partie againſt the Prince Palatine,
and haue impoſed vpon the poore ſubiects, as well
of the Palatinate Electorall, as vpon the Countrey
of the Prince of Symmeren, diuers impoſitions, to
them inſupportable, which endure yet, and are augmented
euery day.
               
                  
It is alſo to be remarked, that the ſaid Articles
of Truce were communicated in the name of the
Emperour, vnto ſome Princes of the Empire, a
whole moneth before that they were concluded,
and accepted in England; and that in other forme,
and partly in another ſence, onely for to gaine aduantage,
and to render and make the Electors and
Princes of the Empire irreſolute, and to hinder
them from fauouring the Prince Elector Palatine,
whoſe totall ruine and extirpation being
the Butt and Marke (what ſemblant or ſhew ſoeuer
they had made to his Maieſtie of Great Brittaine)
vnto which they haue directed all their
Actions, for to effectuate all their aboueſaid
Deſignes.
               By all the which Drifts and Practiſes it may be
ſeene, as in a Mirrour, with how much miſpriſion
they haue moſt vnworthily abuſed the King of
Great Brittaine; and certes hee had deſired much,
that it might haue paſſed in ſilence. But ſince
that Murther and Slanders be the two Inſtruments,
whereof the adherents of the contrarie partie make
vſe, vtterly to ouerthrow the Prince Palatine, and
his friends; it is ineuitably neceſſarie to repreſent
and demonſtrate all that which is before written,
by this briefe Information. The Murthers be ſeene
by all the World, and the Calumnies and Slanders
are made to ſound in the cares of euerie one,
in accuſing the ſaid Prince and his friends of things
whereof they neuer thought.
               But for to auoid prolixitie, among other things

it is publiſhed, written, and blowne abroad in all
places continually, That the ſaid Lord the Prince
hath not from the beginning of theſe Troubles,
hitherto ſhowne any ſigne of his inclination vnto
Peace; but that all his Deſignes hath beene no
other, then to carrie and beare himſelfe with extremitie
of Warre, to the ruine of the Empire, and to
the perill of Chriſtendome. But before God, and
them who know the contrarie, there is produced
here for Witneſſes and Teſtimonies againſt this
