               Madame,
            
            IN the Age of Sacrifices, the truth of Religion was not in the greatnes, and fat of the Offrings, but in the deuotion, and zeale of the Sacrificers: Else, what could a handful of Gummes haue done in the sight of a Hecatombe? Or how, yet, might a gratefull minde be furnish'd against the iniquitie of Fortune; except, when she fail'd it, it had power to impart it selfe? A way found out, to ouercome euen those, whom Fortune hath enabled to returne most, since they, yet leaue themseluesmore. In this assurance am I planted; and stand with those affections

at this Altar, as shall no more auoide the light and witnesse, then they doe the conscience of your vertue. If what

               Your La: true honorer.

                  •
               ges, and Daunces so raigneth, as to runne away from Nature, and be afraid of her, is the onely point of art that tickles the Spectators. But how out of purpose, and place, doe I name Art? when the Professors are growne so obstinate contemners of it, and presumers on their owne Naturalls, as they are deriders of all diligence that way, and, by simple mocking at the termes, when they vnderstand not the things, thinke to get of wittily with their Ignorance. Nay, they are esteem'd the more learned, and sufficient for this, by the Multitude, through their excellent vice of iudgement. For they commend Writers, as they doe Fencers, or Wrastlers; who if they come in robustuously, and put for it with a great deale of violence, are receiu'd for the brauer fellowes: when many times their owne rudenesse is the cause of their disgrace, and a little touch of their Aduersary giues all that boisterous force the foyle, I deny not, but that these men, who alwaies seeke to doe more then inough, may some time happen on some thing that is good, and great; but very seldome: And when it comes it doth not recompen

                the rest of their ill. It sticks out perhaps, and is more eminent, because all is sordide, and vile about it: as lights are more discern'd in a thick darknesse, then a faint shadow. I speake not this, out of a hope to doe good on any man, against his will; for I know, if it were put to the question of theirs, and mine, the worse would finde more suffrages:

because the most fauour common errors. But I giue thee this warning, that there is a great difference betweene those, that (to gain the opinion of Copie) vtter all they can, how cuer vnfitly; and those that vse election, and a meane. For it is onely the disease of the vnskilfull, to thinke rude things greater then polish'd: or scatter'd more numerous then compos'd.

                  A Master, read in flatteries great skill,
               Could not passe truth, though he would force his will,
               By praising this too much, to get more praise
               In his Art, then you out of yours doe raise.
               Nor can full truth be vttered of your worth,
               Vnlesse you your owne praises doe set forth:
               None else can write so skilfully, to shew
               Your praise: Ages shall pay, yet still must owe.
               All I dare say, is, you haue written well,
               In what exceeding height, I dare not tell.

               To th' Author iustice, to our selues but grase.
               Our Scene is LONDON, 'cause we would make knowne.
               No Countries mirth is better then our owne.
               No Clime breedes better matter, for your Whore,
               Baud, Squire, Impostor, many Persons more,
               Whose manners, now call'd Humors, feede the Stage:
               And which haue still beene Subiect, to the rage
               Or spleene of Comick writers. Though this Pen
               Did neuer ayme to grieue, but better Men;

               The vices that she breedes, aboue their cure.
               But, when the wholsome remedies are sweet,

               But will, with such fayre Correctiues, be pleas'd.
               For here, he doth not feare, who can apply.
               If there be any, that will sit so nigh
               Vnto the streame, to looke what it doth runne,
               They shall finde things, they'ld thinke, or wish, were done;
               They are so naturall follies: But so showne,

                     Alike, with me: and I will make me, a back
                     With the Elixir, that shall be as tough
                     As Hercules, to encounter fifty a night.

                     Downe is too hard. And then, mine Oual Roome,
                     Fill'd with such pictures, as Tiberius tooke
                     From Elephantis: and dull Aretine
                     
                     But coldly imitated. Then, my Glasses,
                     Cut in more subtill angles, to disperse,
                     And multiply the figures, as I walke
                     Naked betweene my Succubae. My mistes

                     To loose our selues in; and my bathes, like pittes

                     I'the iust point: preuent your day, at morning.
                     This argues something, worthy of a feare
                     Of importune, and arnall appetite.
                     Take heed, you doe not cause the blessing leaue you,

                     But your whole worke, no more.
                     That, you should hatch gold in a Fornace, Sir,
                     As they doe egges in Egypt.
                     
                  
                  
                     SVB.
                     Sir, doe you
                     Beleeue that egges are hatch'd so?
                  
                  
                     SVr.
                     If I should?
                  
                  
                     SVB.
                     Why, I thinke that the greater Miracle.
                     No Egge, but differs from a Chicken, more,
                     Then Mettalls in themselues.

                     That cannot be.
                     The Egg's ordain'd by Nature, to that end:
                     And is a Chicken, in Potentia.

                     The same we say of Lead, and other Mettalls,
                     Which would be Gold, if they had time.

To thinke that Nature, in the earth, bred Gold
                     Perfect i'the instant. Something went before.
                     There must be remote Matter.

                     It is, of the one part,
                     A humide exhalation, which we call
                     
                        Materia liquida, or the V

                           ctuous Water;
                     
                     On th'other part, a certaine crasse, and viscous
                     Portion of earth; both which, concorporate,
                     Doe make the elementary matter of Gold:
                     Which is not, yet, propria materia,
                     
                     But commune to all Mettalls, and all Stones.
                     For, where it is forsaken of that moysture,
                     And hath more drynesse, it becomes a Stone;
                     Where it retaines more of the humid fatnesse,
                     It turnes to Sulphur, or to Quick-siluer:
                     
                     Who are the Parents of all other Mettals.
                     Nor can this remote Matter, sodainly,
                     Progresse so from extreme, vnto extreme,
                     As to grow Gold, and leape ore all the meanes.
                     
                        Nature doth, first, beget th'imperfect; then
                     Proceedes shee to the perfect. Of that ayrye,
                     And oyly water, Mercury is engendred;
                     
                        Sulphure o'the fat, and earthy part; the one
                     (Which is the last) supplying the place of Male,
                     
                     The other of the Female, in all Mettalls.
                     Some doe beleeue Hermaphrodeitie,
                     
                     That both doe act, and suffer. But these two
                     Make the rest ductile, malleable, extensiue.
                     And, euen in Gold, they are; for we doe finde
                     Seedes of them, by our fire, and Gold in them:
                     And can produce the species of each mettall
                     More perfect thence, then Nature doth in earth.
                     Beside, who doth not see, in dayly practise,
                     Art can beget Bees, Hornets, Beetles, Waspes,
                     Out of the Carcasses, and dung of Creatures;
                     
                        
Yea, Scorpions, of an herbe, being ritely plac'd.
                     And these are liuing Creatures, far more perfect,
                     And excellent, then Mettall.

                     Hurt it? 'Tis the way
                     To heale it, if'twere hurt; to make it more

                     Shee'll be more knowne, more talk'd of, and your Widowes
                     Are ne'er of any price till they be famous;
                     Their Honour is their multitude of Sutors.
                     Send her, it may be thy good fortune. What?
                     Thou dost not know.
