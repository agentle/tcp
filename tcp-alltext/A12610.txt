            To the moſt Gratious
Lady, Lady ELIZABETH,
eldeſt daughter
of our Soueraigne
Lord the King.
            
               BEing willing, amongſt
others of
my Function, to
performe ſome
office to the glory of Gods
people, & conſidering with
my ſelfe the times we liue
in, together with our owne
frailties: I haue in that regard
(moſt vertuous Lady)
labored to compoſe a ſmall
volume of ſhort Prayers

and to contriue it into this
Method; aſſuring my ſelfe
that nothing is or can be
more acceptable to Almightie
God, then the hartie
Prayers of his people.
            In which Collection I
haue alſo inſerted three
moſt ſweete Prayers, made
by the late Queene Elizabeth
of famous memorie.
Which as vpon her occaſions
ſhe powred forth before
the Lord, (as it is written of
King Salomon) kneeling on
her knees, & ſtretching of her
hands to heauen: ſo I thought
them moſt worthy to be regiſtred
for perpetuall memorie,
being compiled by

ſo renowned a perſon as her
ſelfe, and carying in matter
pithe, in ſtile Maieſtie, and
in words true deuotion.
            And vnderſtanding of
your Graces loue of vertue,
with the humbleneſſe of
your minde, and zeale of
ſeruing God, I am therefore
enboldened in the forehead
of this my Myte, to
ſtampe your royall Name:
not doubting of your Graces
fauourable allowance.
Which being my humble
ſuite and deſire, & crauing
pardon for this boldneſſe, I
ceaſe not as heartily to pray
that the manifold graces of
the moſt High may be multiplyed

vpon your Eſtate,
and your Grace long preſerued
to the ioy and comfort
of your moſt roiall Parents
(our Soueraigne King
and Queene) the good of
Gods Church, and the finall
ſaluation of your owne
ſoule.
            
               From the Parſonage

Anno Dom.

               Your Graces moſt humbly
Thomas Sorocold.
            
         
         
            
            To all deuout
People.
            
               
                  CHRISTIAN brethren,
I haue bin
perſuaded to publiſh
to your view
and charitable interpretation,
this handfull of flowers,
picked, ſorted, and tyed vp
into a bundle, according to
my ſlender abilitie, both of
iudgement and inuention. I
haue preſumed alſo to entitle
them SVPPLICATIONS of
Saints, induced thereunto
by three reaſons. First, becauſe
they are ſquared to the
practiſe of the two holy Prophets,
and the bleſſed Apoſtle,

and Saint, Saint Paul. Secondly,
three of theſe praiers,
(which are indeed praeſtantiores,
far more eminent and
excellent then al the reſt proceeding
from humane conceit)
were vſed and penned by the
late noble Queene of famous
memorie ELIZABETH, and
may iustly challenge the Denomination,
as the remaines
of her Deuotion, who liuing
a Religious and Peereleſſe
PRINCE, was truely accounted
(as the Wiſe-man
ſpeaketh) among the Children
of God:
               Wiſd. 5. 5. 
               and now being
taken from vs, hath her
portion among the Saints.
The third reaſon is, becauſe

I hope they may be the dayly
exerciſe of your ſelues, who
being called to the participation
of Ieſus Chriſt, embracing
the Goſpell of God, and
hauing receiued the Sacrament
of life, haue alſo your
part in the Communion of
Saints.
            I haue not helde ſuch a
courſe as happily other Collectors
of the like Deuotions
haue done, and yet I hope you
will not condemne mee but
vpon good deliberation. I
confeſse, they are not mingled
with diſcourſe, forCommoneri aut doceri noſtra locutione non quaerit. Auguſt. de Mag. lib. 1. 
               God
deſireth not to take admonition
or information from
our reports: neither are

they interlaced with Meditations,
for the places of
Scripture which I haue prefixed
before euery one, will
miniſter matter of that Deuotion:
neither haue I made
any of them very longIn mille verſus extendunt Orationem ſuam, quaſi apud Dominum, multitudo ſermonum opus ſit. Chriſoſt. hom. demuliere Caman. 
               to
draw them into a thouſand
periods (as Chryſoſtom
ſaith) as if it were a goodly
worke to multiply much
ſpeech before GOD: But
I haue made them ſomewhat
briefe, ayming at that Rule
which our Lord and Sauiour
preſcribed, ſaying: After
this maner pray ye. That is
(ſaith Chryſoſtome againe)
Collecte voluit diſcipulos Orare. Chriſoſt. Orat. dom. 
               Hee appointed the Diſciples
to gather the Petitions

of their prayers, into a ſhort
ſumme.
            
            Wherefore if ye find them
worthy the name of prayers,
vſe them: if otherwiſe, yet
take them as meane grounds
of Prayer and meditation, to
ſet your deuout thoughts a
worke: with this liberty, that
where I haue been defectiue,
I referre it to the iudicious
to ſupply: and where I haue
offered any thing vaine or offenſiue,
I am content to admit
a godly Corrector. But
how euer it be, yet let me aduiſe
you not to waxe faint
or ſlacke in Prayer: for ſuch
as haue learned of the Lord
Ieſus (ſaith Saint Auguſtine)
               
true humilitie and meekneſſe
of heart,Plus cogitando & orando profierunt, quam in legendo & audiendo. Aug. Ep, 122. 
               receiue more profit
by meditation and prayer,
then in reading and hearing:
whereby ye may be ſure,
the religious Father meant
not to traduce either the
preaching of the word, or the
reading of any thing that may
make a man wiſe vnto ſaluation;
but enforced the more
reuerend reſpect, and more
frequent vſe of this Ghoſtly
exerciſe, that as men are commanded
to be Doers of the
Word,
               Iam. 1. 22. ſo they ſhould be ſeekers
of Grace to doe it by, &
not Hearers onely, for ſo
ſaith the Apoſtle, they ſhould
deceiue themſelues. For when

               Paul hath planted, and Apollos
watered: when one
hath read a learned treatiſe,
and another hath heard a
fruitfull Sermon, they muſt
refer the reſt to him that giueth
the increaſe: and vnto
whom will he giue it? to him
that ſeeketh, vnto him that
knocketh, to him that asketh
humbly and deuoutly in his
prayer. Follow then his counſell
which ſayeth,Oratio aſcendat, vt Gratia deſcendat. 
               Put vp
your Prayers to him, that
hee may ſend downe his
grace to you.
            
            Againe beloued, all is not
peace, if yee conſider of what
Church we are, while we be
in this world. S. Paul tels

vs that we are in a Warfare,
               2 Cor. 10. 4.
& that Prayer, is a principall
peece of our Armour:
               Epheſ. 6. 12. therefore
his counſell is,Ephe. 6. 28. 
               Pray alwayes,
& watch thereunto.
For wee cannot (as Abiſhai
ſaid to Dauid,
               1 Sam. 26. 8. concerning
his blow) make ſo ſure worke
at one time, that we ſhall not
need to come againe: But rather,
ſo many are our ſinnes,
as the haires of our heads;
ſo many our enemies, as the
stars in the skye, and ſo fierce
and ſtrong the Tempter, as a
roaring Lyon; that as the
Man of God was angry with
the King of Iſrael (becauſe
when he bad him ſmite the
earth with his dart,2 King. 13. 19. he ſmote
onely thrice) who ſhould haue

ſmiten fiue or ſixe times, that
he might haue beene aſſured
of the ouerthrow of his enemies:
So GOD that bids vs
continue in Prayer,
               Coloſſ. 4. 2. will be
angry with vs, if wee pray
not againe, and againe, as the
importunate widdow in the
Goſpel proſecuted her ſuite:Luke 18. 3
yea (to ſpeake of Deuotion as
he doth of compaſſion) if we
pray not ſeuen times,
               Mat. 18. 22. 
               yea,
ſeuentie times ſeuen times,
that wee may obtaine a bleſſing.
I ſpeake to them that
haue vnderſtanding, iudge
you what I ſay, and I ſhall
pray vnto the Holy One of
Iſrael in heauen, that your
inſpirations may be heauenly,

your deſires holy, & your
Prayers here feruent and
frequent, & there acceptable
before the throne of his Maieſtie,
to the reliefe of your
neceſſities, and to the ſetting
forth of his glory in IESVS
Chriſt, Amen.

               THE moſt abſolute
prayer, and
beſt Rule of all
holy Petitions,
is that which our Lord &
Sauiour taught his Diſciples.
A Prayer large for
matter, ſhort for Phraſe,
and ſweet for order, which,
(I hauing thus paraphraſed
as you ſee) thought not ſo
good to inſert it into this
bundle, as to place it here
alone before them all: as
a Supplication not appropriate
to any one part, but
apperaining & giuing life
to all, and fit to conclude euery
one.
            
               
               A Paraphraſe vpon the
Lords Prayer.
               OVR FATHER

                     By right of Creation.
                     Merit of Mercie.
                     Gracious prouiſion.
                  
               
            
            
               Which art
in Heauen.

                     The ſeate of thy Maieſtie.
                     The inheritance of thy children.
                     The kingdome of bliſſe.
                  
               
            
            
               Hallowed

Name.

                     By the thoughts of our hearts.
                     By the words of our mouthes.
                     By the works of our hands.

                     Of glory to crowne vs.
                  
               
            
            
               Thy will be

                     In weale and woe.
                     In fulneſſe and wane.

                     For the nouriſhing of our bodies.
                     For the feeding of our Soules.
                     The reliefe of all neceſsities.
                  
               
            
            
               
               And forgiue
vs our
debts.

                     Whereby thou art diſhonoured.
                     Our Neighbour wronged, or,
                     Our ſelues indangered.
                  
               
            
            
               As we forgiue
our

                     That haue hurt vs in our bodies.
                     Hindred vs in our goods.
                     Wronged vs in our good Name.

                     OH LORD
GOD, Almightie
Father, and

Sonne of the Father,

Ieſus Chriſt, with the holy
Ghoſt, holy, bleſſed and
glorious Trinitie; eternall
God, Lord of the Sabbath,
and the fountaine of all
wiſdome. I do not preſent
theſe my Supplications
before thee for my righteouſneſſe,
but for thy
great mercies. I truſt in
them truely, without diffidence:
I truſt in them only,
without any other plea:
I truſt in them alwayes
without wearines, & therfore
I beſeech thee, grant
mee mercifull audience.
Mercifully heare mee, O
Lord, mercifully heare
me O Lord God. Firſt,

I extoll thy infinite goodneſſe
and mercy, together
with thine eternall wiſedome
and truth, that thou
haſt protected me all this
night paſt, and made me
to reſt and ſleep ſo quietly
and ſecurely vnder the
ſhadow of thy wings. And
(I beſeech thee, from the
bottome of my heart) to
protect me this day with
thy mighty hand from all
dangers, both of body
and ſoule. Giue thy holy
Angels charge ouer mee,
to keepe mee in all my
wayes: driue away from
mee the euill angell and
deadly enemie; remooue

all offences of this world.
Mortifie and kill in me all
carnall luſtes, vnlawfull
pleaſures, and euill affections,
that they may haue
no dominion or raigne in
my mortall body, & giue
me a contrite heart to bewaile
my former life, and
let me find comfort in thy
mercy, for the remiſsion
of my ſinnes.
                  Sanctifie me (O holy
Father) this holy day, with
thine eſpeciall grace, that
I may honour thee as a
Creator, loue thee as a
redeemer, & expect thee
as a Sauiour, and that I
may haue modeſt cariage

in my behauiour, true deuotion
in my Prayers, and
reuerent attention to
heare thy ſacred word;
and ſo vnlocke the eares
of mine vnderſtanding,
that I may obſerue, learne
and imbrace, ſuch things
as are neceſſary for mee,
to the better confirmation
of my faith in Chriſt
Ieſus, and the ſaluation of
my ſoule by his blood.
Rayſe mee, O Father, by
the power of thy ſonnes
reſurrection, from ſinne
and iniquitie, and giue me
ſpirituall, reſt in the communion
of Saints, that
hereafter when I ſhal leaue

this world, I may keepe
the euerlaſting Sabbath
with thee in the Kingdom
of Heauen.
                  Behold (O Lord) I knock
at the doore of thy mercy,
for all theſe graces,
with all the powers of my
ſtrength, ſoule, and mind:
beſeeching thee to continue
vnto mee the right
vſe of all the powers and
faculties of the ſame, and
to ſend thy holy Spirit to
beare witneſſe to my Spirit,
that I am thy child,
and ſhall be heire of thy
Kingdome, with Chriſt Ieſus
our Lord, and through
his merits, for whoſe ſake,

I beſeech thee, to grant all
thoſe things all that I haue
prayed for. Amen.

of the Word.
                  O Lord Ieſus, which haſt
cōmanded vs to pray
for labourers to the Harueſt,
we beſeech thee, ſend
painefull Miniſters into
thy Church. Endue them
with ſuch wiſedome and
ſpeech, as the aduerſaries
may not be able to
gaine-ſay. Open vnto
them the doore of doctrine,

giue them the ſpirit
of boldneſſe, that they
may faithfully diſpenſe
thy Myſteries, and ſpeake
thy Word freely. Take
away all contentions and
differences from among
them. Make them examples
to thoſe that beleeue,
in ſoundneſſe of
Doctrine, and pureneſſe
of life. And becauſe the
rule of our life depends
vpon thy word in their
mouthes, bleſſe them with
all graces fit for their calling,
that wee may giue
thankes vnto thee, and
praiſe thy Name for euermore,
Amen.

I haue either wittingly or
ignorantly done; eſpecially,

God,
which beyond
all meaſure haſt vnlocked
the treaſures of thy fauour
and bleſsing vnto mee,
from time to time: I moſt

heartily thanke thee forthe
ſweet ſleepe and comfortable
reſt which I haue

I conſecrate my ſoule and
body to thy ſeruice this
day againe, and euer hereafter,
deſiring that my
prayer earely now this
Morning, may haue acceſſe

                  O Lord, I pray thee
bleſſe, preſerue, and keepe
me this day, by thy power
from ſinne, ſhame and all
euill, and ſo direct mee
with thy grace, that all my

may pleaſe thee. Stand, I
beſeech thee, between me

haſt now raiſed vp my body
from a ſound and heauie
ſleepe: ſo deliuer my
ſoule from the dead ſleepe
of ſinne, and the darkenes

Lord, the creature which
dependeth vpon thy prouidence
only. Further my
buſineſſe, that I may truly
walke without ſinne, and
ſafely worke without danger
in that vocation
whereunto thou haſt called
me in this life.
                  O Lord Ieſus haue mercy

vpon me miſerable ſinner,
pardon and forgiue

Remember not mine obſtinacies,
and haue compaſſion

Set thy holy Paſſion,
Croſſe, and Death,
betweene thy iudgement
and my Soule, both now
and at the houre of death.
Of thy mercie, O Lord,
ſtrengthen my weakneſſe,
and mortifie my corrupt
nature, enclining to ſwearing,
wantonneſſe, lying,
or any other ſinne whatſoeuer;
and grant that I may
ſo walke in thy wayes, by

the light of thy holy word,
that no worldly vanitie
bewitch me to ſel my ſelfe
to worke wickedneſſe.
                  O holy Father, graunt
me a ſound mind, and the
right vſe of my ſenſes continually,
that knowing
what I doe, and practiſing
what I know, I may worthily
lament the wickedneſſe
of my life, and euer
vpon my vnfained repentance,
feele thy comforts
in my ſoule, and neuer forget
the deſire of the life
to come. O Lord, bleſſe

this life, and after death,
reſtore the ſame body and

ſoule to life eternal. Heare

onely Lord and Sauiour,

creation after thine owne
Image, and all other good
graces now and euer beſtowed

vpon vs. Giue vs

liue as becommeth thy
children, in all holines and
righteouſneſſe. Incline our
harts to thy law, & not to
couetouſnes: open our eies
that wee may behold the
ſecret things of thy Law.
Make vs fruitfull in all
good works, forgiue vs our

proſper the workes of our

Sacrifice of praiſe and

Seaſon, O Lord, my

grace, that with a ſanctified
heart, I may make a
godly vſe of all thoſe good
things which I haue heard,
ſeene, or read this day.
And further, lighten mine
eies that I ſleepe not in

death, nor walke in darkneſſe
ſpiritual or corporal,
to endanger eyther my
body or my ſoule.
                  O Lord, let mine eyes
ſleepe, and inioy that moderate
recreation which
thou haſt appointed for
my weariſome condition,
but let my ſoule continually
watch vnto thee, to attend
thy comming, that
when my ſleepe hath not
beene vnmeaſurable, to
pleaſe exceſſiuely the eaſe
of my fleſh, I may be the
better diſpoſed to thy ſeruice
to morrow.
                  Preſerue me Lord, from
all vncleanneſſe, both of

body and ſoule, from all
dangers that walke in the
night: and keep me from
all temptations of him
that is the prince of darkneſſe.
Forgiue me the ſins
and offences which I haue
committed this day, in
thought, word & deed, againſt
thee, or my neighbour.
Giue mee grace to
water my Couch with
teares, in vnfeined repentance
of my ſins paſt, & ſo
to paſſe the reſidue of my
life, that in regard of thy
iuſtice, I may retaine a holy
feare, to ſtand alwaies in
awe of thee: and in regard
of thy mercy conceyue

ſure hope neuer to deſpaire.
                  O Lord, keepe me this
night, both in body and
ſoule, that I may ioyfully
riſe againe, be thankefull
vnto thee, and diligently
walke in my vocation and
calling, to the glory of
thy holy Name, and the
commoditie of my neighbour,
for Ieſus Chriſts
ſake, our onely
Lord and Sauiour.

in me all godly deſires,
together with true
contrition of heart, that I

the pleaſures of this world,
& with harty repentance

be conuerted vnto thee.
Send thy holy Angell to
guide me, and keepe me
in all my waies; and proſper
the worke of my
hands, that I neuer faile
in my vocation to doe
good, and eſchew euill.
                  O Lord, I beſeech thee,
preſerue and keepe my
ſenſes ſafe and ſound, that
I be neither corrupted
by proſperitie, nor caſt
downe by aduerſitie; nor
be too fearefull of thy
iudgements, or too bold
vpon thy mercy: But grant
mee grace, O mercifull
Lord, that I may apprehend
all things that come

from thee with a religious,
contented mind, and
in the end of my dayes,
by a liuely Fayth, may
ioyfully arriue in the
Land of promiſe, the
Kingdome of HEAVEN,
through the merits of
IESVS CHRIST,
my onely Sauiour
and Redeemer,

whereof I depend

which may come either by
fooliſh dreames, noiſome
ſpirits, or vncleanneſſe of
corrupt Nature. Waken
me againe, O Lord, in due
time, and let mee behold

the light of the next day,
prepare me to thy ſeruice
euery day in all truth and
ſinceritie, that when I
haue run the race of this
life, thou mayeſt be pleaſed
to call mee to be partaker
of a better, that ſo I

Keepe my ſences within

order my iudgement, for
the accompliſhing of thoſe

things that appertaine to
my vocation.
                  O Lord, defend me from
all ſhame and diſgraces:
ſhield me from al violence,
and guide mee ſafely from
all perillous & dangerous
wayes. Make mee as thy
Spouſe, inwardly and outwardly
prepared by thy

pure Virgine vnto Chriſt.
Diſplay vpon me thy banners
of loue, ſpred abroad
in my heart by the Holy
Ghoſt: that with the eye of
Faith, I may beholde and
ſee the Croſſe of Chriſt,
and his ſacred wounds, the
comfortable price of my

redemption; and ſtand ſo
faſt in this Chriſtian warfare,
that nothing make me
yeeld to the temptations of
the Diuell. O Lord, ſo
ſtrengthen mee with thy
grace in this vale of miſerie,
that all my outward
members may follow the
direction of my heart, and
my heart being ſincerely
dedicated vnto thee, I may
ſerue thee in holineſſe and
Righteouſneſſe, all the

mercie. Continue thy
goodnes towards me, I beſeech
thee, though I deſerue
it not: inſpire my
minde with holy motions,
conuert me from euil, confirme

me in al that is good.
Comfort mee, thou comforter,
when I ſhall haue
moſt neede. Cleare the
ſtormes of temptation, and
inflame the coldneſſe of
my zeale, with the fire of
thy loue. Lead me into all
truth, and reclayme mee

I moſt heartily thanke thee
for keeping mee this day
from manifold dangers,
both of Body and Soule,
which might iuſtly haue

fallen vpon mee. Nowe I
humbly beſeech thee,
bring not into iudgement
what I haue done amiſſe
this day, but mercifully
pardon the eſcapes and offences
of the ſame. Forgiue
and forget (O LORD) all
mine idle and vaine words,
and impute not my fooliſhnes
vnto mee. Deſtroy in
me the kingdome of ſinne,
the power of Sathan, the
deſires of the world, & the
vaine delights of the fleſh.
                  Lord, into thy hands I
commend my ſelfe, euen
ſoule and body this night
and euer. Lighten my
darkeneſſe that I ſleepe not

in death, & defend me that
no euill happen vnto me.
Take not thy holy Spirit
from mee, but continue
the motions thereof in my
heart, that when as the
Tempter ſhall come with
his aſſaults, I may be furniſhed
with the ſhield of faith
to quench his fiery darts.
                  Comfort me (ô Lord) in
all thoſe things wherein I
haue beene any wayes diſmayed
this day. Confirme
my weakeneſſe, and grant
that this nights ſleepe may
be ſweet and healthfull to
my body, and a profitable
memoriall of that ſleepe,
which at my laſt end in that

great night, ſhall make a ſeparation
betweene my body
and ſoule. Let thine vnſpeakeable
mercy preſerue
me, thy endles ſweetnes reioyce
mee, thy heauenly
truth ſtrengthen mee, thy
knowledge embolden me,
and thy goodnes keep me,
now & for euermore, from
mine enemies, viſible and
inuiſible: that I may awake
in the Morning in perfect
ſenſe, & good health, and
for the ſame be thankefull
vnto thee, & carefully betake
mee to my vocation
& calling, for Ieſus Chriſts
ſake, my onely Lord and
Sauiour. Amen.

light. Now (I beſeech
thee) by the bleſſed Incarnation,
and holy Natiuitie
of thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt
(the bleſſed day-ſtar that
appeared to the world) let
thy mercy this day ariſe
vpon me, & let the day-ſtar
of thy light ſhine in my

away through the power of

darkenes, to ſpend this day
after mine owne minde and

carefully follow thy fatherly

to beleeue in thee and thy

negligence, nor the infirmitie
of the fleſh, nor the
grieuouſnes of temptation,

LORD, the thicke miſtes
and clouds of mine iniquities,
and waſh them away
in the blood of thy Sonnes

paſſion. Giue me a will to
worke duely in my vocation
this day, that I be not
idle; and order my skil with
the rule of thy wiſedome,
that I bee not vnfruitfull.
Bleſſe my body and ſoule,
that none euill or harme
come vnto me, & my memory
and ſenſes, that they
paſſe not the limites which
thou haſt appointed them.
                  O Lord, lighten my mind
to looke vpon good things
onely, inflame my heart
with the loue of them, and
conduct mee by thy grace
to attaine them: that as
thou haſt awaked my body
from ſleepe; ſo my Soule

may bee rayſed from the
ſlumber of ſinne, and darkneſſe
of this World, and
they both being companions
and fellowes in the
way of godlineſſe, may be
made partakers of euerlaſting
life at the latter day,

diſquieted by dreams,
nor afraid of any terrour.
Haue mercy vpon mee (O
God) haue mercy on mee,
and of thy wonted goodneſſe,
forgiue mee all my
tranſgreſſions, eſpecially
thoſe which I haue committed
this day againſt thy
holineſſe: ſhew mee the

light of thy countenance,
and let me finde comfort in
the remorſe of my conſcience.
Bleſſe mee (ô Lord)
and water mee with the
dewe of thy bleſſings, and
let the drops of thy ſonnes
blood, ſhed for my ſinnes,
(and yet crying for mercy)
diſtill into my heart by a
liuely faith, for the comfort
of my ſoule, and the
amendment of my life.
                  I beſeech thee, O Lord,
take from mee all manner
of darkeneſſe, misbeliefe,
infidelitie, carnall luſts, and
affections; & ſo ſtrengthen
me with thy grace, that the
Barke of my weake Faith

ſinke not, nor I be ouerturned
by the ſtormes of
Sathan, the waues of wickedneſſe,
nor the tempeſt
of a biting Conſcience.
Enter thy iudgements in
the Tables of my heart,
that I may be content to
ſpare of my ordinarie
ſleepe, and be more earneſt
vpon the meditation of thy
ſacred word, then the kings
of the Nations haue beene
to turne ouer their records
in the night ſeaſon. Bee
mindefull of mee, when I
happen to forget my ſelfe,
and thinke vpon me ſleeping
and waking.
                  
                     
Graunt me (ô Lord) this
freedome and liberty, that
I may lie downe in peace
and reſt, and riſe vp againe
in due time ſafely, to the
honour and glory of thy
Name, and the managing
of my worldly buſineſſe in
thy feare, through Ieſus
Chriſt, our onely Lord
and Sauiour,

                     OH IMMORTAL
and euerlaſting
God, Father of
our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, I thy vnworthy ſeruant
beſeech thee, to accept

this my Morning
Sacrifice of prayſe and
thankes, due vnto thee alone,
for protecting me with
thy mighty hand, from the
feares of this night paſt, &
refreſhing my weary body
with naturall and kindely
reſt: and herevnto (I humbly
intreat thee) to ioyne
thy further grace, for the
rouſing vp of my ſlothfull
and ſluggiſh nature, that I
may ariſe from ſinne, and
walke in the way of thy
Commandements with all
chearefulneſſe this day and
euermore.
                  Pardon (O Lord I beſeech
thee) the euils, and

abhominations of my life
and conuerſation. Cut off
the rootes, boughs, leaues,
and fruits, of the euill tree
of my heart: put away the
inward luſts, doubtings,
and denying of thy prouidence,
with all thoſe groſſe
and out-ward ſinnes which
I haue committed daily
againſt thee: and giue me
a ſure hope of euerlaſting
life, that alwaies, while I am
in this world, I may haue
the taſt and feeling of it in
my heart.
                  Giue me grace, O Lord,
to ſhun and auoid all thoſe
things which thou either
hateſt, or haſt no pleaſure

in. Take from mee a proud
looke, and a deceitfull
tongue, bloody hands, and
a heart any wayes giuen to
wicked imaginations. Keep
me this day from all perils
that may come vnto my
ſoule and body, either by
Sathan himſelfe or his Miniſters.
Bleſſe my ſenſes
and vnderſtanding, that in
all things I may heare and
ſpeake reaſon: and ſuffer
me not (I beſeech thee) to
ſpeake, thinke, or doe any
thing this day, but that
which may pleaſe thee, be
anſwerable to my vocation,
and tend vnto the
aduancement of thy glory,

and the health of my ſoule.
                  O Lord, I pray thee, ſend
thy bleſſing vpon all my labours,
and giue me a mind
to helpe them that haue
neede, according to my abilitie.
And ſo prepare my
heart in all my buſineſſe,
that I may alwayes begin
it in thy Name, and goe
forward in thy feare, and
finiſh it with thy bleſsing:
that whatſoeuer I ſhall doe,
it may proſper. Grant this
(O Lord) for Ieſus Chriſts
ſake, our onely Mediator
and Redeemer.
Amen.

                  A Prayer for Patience.
                  O God which art the
God of Patience, and
conſolation to the Patient,
ſtay my vnbridled nature
this day and euer, from all
diſcontentednes of minde,
and furious actions. Giue
mee grace to take in good
part whatſoeuer doth befal
me, and let my heart acknowledge
it to be the
Lords doing, and not by
chance. Quiet my minde

in the manifold diſquietings
of this world, and open
mine eyes that I may ſee
helpe in thee. Preuent all
that is againſt mee, and all
that falleth out, turne to the
beſt for mee. Thy will be
done, and graunt mee
patience for Ieſus
Chriſts ſake.
Amen.

fearefully and wonderfully
made. Meruailous are
thy workes, and that my
ſoule knoweth right well.
                  
                  HOnour and praiſe be
vnto thee, Oh Lord
moſt high and immortall
GOD, for thy gracious
goodneſſe and mercie extended
to me this day, and

alwayes, notwithſtanding
all my wickedneſſes which
cry daily againſt mee, and
mine enemies that would
ſwallow mee vp. I beſeech
thee (ô Lord) continue thy
gracious and mercifull fauour
vnto mee, let the ſhadow
of thy wings be my
couer, thy Holy-ghoſt my
comfort, & thy holy Name
my Rocke and defence, againſt
all feare and trembling
which may ouertake
mee, this night or any
other time. Forgiue me all
that is paſt, euen all the euill
that I haue done or
thought, and graunt that I
may euer hereafter ſerue

and pleaſe thee in holineſſe
and newneſſe of life. Be
thou my ſhield & defence
againſt the ſuggeſtions, illuſions,
and temptations of
Sathan; and all the allurements
& baits of the fleſh,
with all alterations, prouocations,
changes & chances
of the world. Sanctifie
mee with thy grace, that
my body may be kept vndefiled,
as the Temple of
the holy Ghoſt, and my
ſoule defended, cheriſhed,
and tendered, as the apple
of thine eye.
                  O good GOD, the
Sunne is gone downe, the
Webbe of this day is almoſt

ſpun, and the night at
hand. Bleſſe me (I beſeech
thee) this night, and take
mee into thy cuſtodie, ſaue
me waking, keepe me ſleeping,
that I may both ſleep
and wake in peace and ſafetie.
Prepare me (O Lord)
for the day following, the
holy ſabbath, the hallowed
day of thy reſt, and my
great dutie: and then ſo
vnlocke the myſteryes of
thy holy word vnto mee,
that I may therein learne
the leſſons of thy glorious
Maieſtie, and mine owne
mortalitie.
                  Graunt me (ô Lord) ſuch
grace as I may make a right

vſe of all things, and that
the hearing of thy word, &
the good examples of thy
ſeruants, agreeing with the
rule of thy word, may bee
both as a bridle to reſtraine
me from ſin, and a
ſpurre to ſet me forward to
all holineſſe of life, and
conuerſation in this world.
O Lord grant mee theſe &
all other good things, euen
for Ieſus Chriſts ſake my
onely Lord and Sauiour.
Amen.
               
            
            
               
               A Prayer for
the Morning.
               
                  O Lord God, moſt
mightie & mercifull
Father, I
vnworthy creature
acknowledge mine
owne vilenes, naturall corruption
and abhominable
ſinnes, many times committed
againſt thee: I beſeech
thee admit mee to

render thee my bounden
thankes, for thy manifold
mercies extended towards
me this night paſt, and all
other times of my life: for
my reſt and ſleep, my food,
and rayment, my health,
peace and liberty, and the
hope of a better life in the
merites of thy Sonnes bitter
paſsion. Now deare
Father, I beſeech thee to
continue thy mercifull fauour
vnto me this day and
euer hereafter. Forgiue me
all mine vnthankfulnes, vnkindnes
and prophanenes
towards thee, thy word and
ſeruice, or towards my
Neighbour. Set all my

ſinnes ouer to that reckoning,
which thy Sonne Ieſus
Chriſt, my Lord, hath
made vp for them vpon his
Croſſe; neuer lay any of
them to my charge, but
freely forgiue and forget
all.
               O Lord ſtrike my heart
with thy rod, that I may alway
be furniſhed for a true
and vnfained repentance;
that I may not be blinded
in my ſinnes, to delight in
them, or to think that thou
wilt not reſpect my vntowardneſſe;
but that I may
be weary of them, grieue
for them, and by all means
poſsible ſtriue to attaine to

a true mortification of the
fleſh, and ſo liue holily, and
iuſtly, and ſoberly in this
preſent world.
               O good God, I humbly
intreat thee, leaue me not
to my ſelfe, mine owne luſts
and deſires: but aſſiſt mee
with thy grace to hearken
vnto thee and thy word, &
to paſſe my time in feare
and trembling, as an obedient
childe of ſo good a
Father.
               Bleſſe me Lord this day,
and proſper all that I ſhall
take in hand; let mee haue
all my directions from thy
will, and the ſucceſſe from
thy mercifull hand. Giue

mee a competent ſtay for
the maintenance of this
mortall life. Continue may
food, and rayment, health,
peace and liberty, that I
may with a quite minde &
thankefull heart paſſe my
time in this vale of miſerie,
doing good to all men after
mine abilitie, without
diſgrace to my ſelfe, or
harme to any one.
               Grant theſe good things
moſt mercifull God, and
all other needefull graces,
not onely vnto me, but vnto
all thy deere children in
the world, to the good of
our ſoules and bodies, for
Ieſus Chriſts ſake, in whoſe

name I further call vpon
thee, as he hath taught vs,
in his Goſpell, ſaying,
Our Father which
art in Heauen,
&c.
               
            
            
               
               A Prayer for the
Euening.
               
                  O Eternall GOD,
and moſt mercifull
Father, I doe
confeſſe againſt my ſelfe
that my heart and hands
are full of all filthines and
ſinnes whatſoeuer, and I
am altogether vnworthy
to ſpeake vnto thee, or to
come neere thy preſence.
Neuertheleſſe beeing ſo
much bound vnto thee, as
this day paſt, and all other
times of my life doe witneſſe,

I offer vnto thy holines
(by the hands of Ieſus
Chriſt my Mediator)
my humble dutie of praiſe
and thanksgiuing for my
creation, election, redemption,
vocation and ſanctification,
with all other good
graces appertaining to this
life, or that which is to
come. And namely, ô Lord
my tongue and lippes ſhall
glorifie thee, ſitting aboue
the Cherubins, for preſeruing
me this day paſt from
ſo many miſeries and caſualties
whereinto I might
iuſtly haue fallen, if thou
wouldeſt haue entred into
iudgement with mee. But

Lord thou art mercifull &
paſſeſt by my offences, to
winne me by thy long ſufferance:
I beſeech thee
make mee thankfull for all
thy mercies.
               O Lord, pardon and forgiue
mee all my ſinnes:
graunt me euery day more
and more the ſight and feeling
of them, with heartie
ſorrow and vnfained repentance
for the ſame. Giue
mee grace to belieue all
the ſweet promiſes that
thou haſt made vnto mee
in Chriſt Ieſus, both for
the remiſsion thereof, and
the hope of a better life:
ſtrengthen me from aboue

with thy mighty hand, to
walke in euery good way
without feare, and to bring
forth the fruits of a true &
liuely faith in my life and
conuerſation, all the dayes
of my life.
               Arme me O Lord with
thy grace and holy ſpirit againſt
all the common corruptions
of the world, the
temptations of the Diuell,
and the allurements of the
fleſh: and ſettle my minde
to the continuall exerciſe
of deuout prayer, with the
hearing of thy ſacred word
watching for thy comming
both publike and priuate.
               Continue thy goodneſſe

towards mee, in prouiding
for mee ſuch things as are
neceſſarie for the maintenance
of this preſent life,
and bleſſe the ſame vnder
my hand: that the little
which I haue may be increaſed,
and the increaſe
may ſerue, as well to furniſh
my neceſſarie vſes, as
to miniſter vnto the neceſſities
of others, according
to mine abilitie.
               Keepe mee, Lord, this
night from all euils, which
may happen either vnto
my body, or my ſoule. Extend
thy goodneſſe toward
all thoſe that depend vpon
me, or I on them. Giue me

quiet ſleepe and reſt, and
when I ſhall awake, let all
my thoughts and cogitations
be holy meditations on
thee and thy law. Bleſſe me
O Lord, all the nights and
dayes of my life, and at the
end thereof ſend me a bleſſed
departure, and afterward
a ioyfull reſurrection
vnto life eternall.
               Graunt me theſe good
things moſt mercifull father,
and all other needfull
graces, for Ieſus Chriſts
ſake, in whoſe name I further
call vpon thee, as hee
hath taught vs in his Goſpell,
ſaying, Our
Father, &c.

                     GOD of Light,
who haſt preſerued
mee, and
brought mee
from the darkeneſſe of this
night, ſhine into my heart
this day and euer, by thy

bleſſed and holy ſpirit, that
I may be enlightened, and
ledde into all Truth, that I
may walke faithfully, as
the childe of light before
thee, caſting away the
workes of darkneſſe, in the
place that thou haſt ſet me,
doing and performing diligently
thoſe things that
thou haſt required of me,
either to the praiſe of thy
name, or to the comfort of
my Brethren▪ Graunt this
good Lord, I humbly beſeech
thee, for Ieſus
Chriſts ſake.
Amen.

Euening.
                  
                     I Thanke thee O
Father, for thy
gracious protection
of me this
day. I beſeech thee keepe
me alſo this night vnder
thy wing, that I reſting in
thee, may finde ſuch comfort
and ſtrength both in
body and ſoule, as may enable
mee to the performance
of my duty. Grant
this I humbly beſeech
thee for Ieſus Chriſts ſake

               A Prayer to God the
Father, as a Preparatiue
to the Meditation
enſuing.
               O Gracious Lord, almightie
and euerlaſting
God, the father of my
Lord and Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt; who was borne at
Bethlem in great pouerty:
Graunt me, I beſeech thee,
a roome among the wiſe

men of the Eaſt, to offer
the poore talent of my
weake deuotion vnto him
all the dayes of my life:
euen a true Faith, for pure
Gold, the perfume of deuout
Praier, for ſweet Frankincenſe,
and hearty Sorrow,
with bitter Teares of
Repentance, for dropping
Myrrhe.
               
               And becauſe hee came
into this world in ſuch humilitie,
yet furniſhed with
ſuch a meaſure of loue, that
hee was content for my
ſake, to be laden with the
burthen of all our infirmities,
to carry our ſorrowes,
to vnder goe a world of

iniuries and miſeries, and
at the laſt in a ſhamefull
death to offer vp himſelfe
in Sacrifice to thee for my
redemption; vouchſafe me
thy Grace, that I may pick
vp ſome Crummes vnder
his Table, and gather vp
ſome fruits at the foote of
his Croſſe, that when I
haue ſeene, what Iudas
ſould, & the Iewes bought:
what Iudas loſt, and I haue
gained, I may bathe my
ſoule in the purple ſtreame
of his moſt precious blood
and then entombe him, &
lay him vp in a beleeuing
heart, vntill his glorious
appearance: So that all

the dayes of my life, being
waſhed (as the Apoſtle
ſaith) being ſanctified, and
being iuſtified in the name
of the Lord Ieſus, and by
the ſpirit of my God, I may
neuer be without ſorrow
for my Sinnes, thankfulnes
for thy Benefits, feare of
thy Iudgements, loue of
thy Mercies, nor remembrance
of
thy preſence.
Amen.
               
            
            
               
               A
Meditation or Prayer
vpon the Life, Death, and
Paſsion of our Lord and
Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.
               
                  O LORD Chriſt
Ieſus, Sonne of
God, thou holy,
mighty, & wonderfull
God and Man, who
art the life of the liuing,
and the death of Death,
and therefore both in life

and death aduantage:
Whoſe life for my ſake,
was feebled with naturall
infirmities, and death cauſed
by violent ſorrowes, &
yet thy life milde, and thy
death qiuet. I beſeech thee
giue mee a fleſhie heart, to
weepe and ſhedde teares
downe my cheekes, if not
for thy paines (who didſt
ſweat drops of blood trickling
downe to the ground,
& afterward dyedſt for my
ſake) yet for my ſins, which
then bred thy ſorrow, and
now worke my woe.
               Lord, I know that for
me, the tempeſt of thy
Fathers anger, and fire of

his wrath was ſtirred and
kindled againſt thee; wherfore
now with the wiſe men
of the Eaſt, and all the
Iewes, I come to ſeeke thee
in the Stable at Bethleem,
and in Mount Caluarie.
At Bethleem, where the
Manger was thy Bed to be
borne in: in Mount Caluarie,
where the Croſſe
was thy Bed to dye on.
In Bethleem, where a handfull
of Straw was the pillow
for thy ſacred Head to
reſt on: in Mount Caluary,
where a crowne of Thornes
and a number of Nailes
pierced and faſtened both
head and body. In Bethleem,

where courſe ſwadling
clothes were thy beſt
Roabes: and in Mount
Caluarie, where thou didſt
hang naked in much miſerie.
I come to adore thee,
to prayſe thee, to pray
thee, that as in thy life
time, thou waſt content to
be bred, borne & brought
vp in manifold infirmities,
(to ſtrengthen our frailtie,
and to demonſtrate the
truth of thy Humanitie)
and then at thy death, to
diſarme thy ſelfe, and to be
broken with them, for the
diſcharge of our Captiuitie,
& the aſſurance of our
acceſſe to the Throne of

grace. So thou wilt bee
pleaſed as a gracious King
to holde out thy golden
Scepter of mercy to my
fearefull conſcience, that
I may come neere to looke
into thy wounds, to ſue for
compaſſion and pardon, &
to taſte of thy goodneſſe,
who am a ſinnefull wretch,
full of corruption and manifold
infirmities.
               2 O ſweet Ieſus, how ſhall
I recount the large ſeuerals
of thine innocent paſſions,
from thy poore Natiuity,
to thy guiltles death?
From thy bloodie ſweat
and heauie agonie in one

garden, to thy ſtrange buriall
in another? How can
I thinke of thy labours in
preaching, thy wearineſſe
in trauailing, thy watchfulneſſe
in Praying, thy temptings
in faſting, thy teares
in pittying, and not confeſſe
more iuſtly of thee,
then Dauid did of his Ionathan,
Very kinde haſt thou
beene vnto mee: thy loue to
mee was wonderfull, paſsing
the loue of women?
               
               Was it not inough, euen
for loue to mee, to be
cloathed with the vaile of
fleſh, but that thou muſt be
compaſſed with the ſhadow
of death? Was it not

inough to become Earth,
Earth, Earth, but thou muſt
become alſo Woe, Woe, Woe?
The God of heauen to become
the Sonne of Man!
The Lord of life to bee
made the childe of death!
The Maiſter to be turned
to be a Seruant, and from
a Seruant, to be counted a
bad Seruant! No proofe
brought, and yet ſcourged
without meaſure: No Inditement
found, and yet
crucified without mercie!
Oh, the beloued of the
Lord ran through Bryars
of Paſſions! Oh, the holy
Lambe was betrayed, carried
away, bound, condemned,

conſorted with malefactors
and Theeues; and,
like Ionas, plunged in the
maine depth of ſorrowes,
and ſwallowed vp of the
whale of death! O Lambe
of God, that takeſt away
the ſinnes of the world,
haue mercy vpon mee.
               3 O Lord Ieſus, it is the
ioy of my heart, that thou
haſt taken and borne all
mine infirmities. All, ſpirituall
and corporall: true
euidences of thy humanity,
but no impediments to thy
Charitie. All of Soule, all
of Body, and yet neither
deformed in faſhion, nor

diſtempered in paſſion, nor
tainted with any guilt of
ſinne. Thy ſoule heauie to
the death, ſhall bring my
ſoule to life: I ſhould neuer
haue beene heartily
merry, except thou hadſt
beene painefully ſad, and
grieuouſly ſorrowfull. I
ſhould neuer haue beene
verily ſatisfied, except
thou hadſt truely hungred
and thirſted. I ſhould neuer
haue beene deliuered from
feare, and abſolutely bold,
except thou hadſt naturally
feared.
               O thou euer-glorious
God, the conſolation of Iſraell,
and the hope of all

the ends of the earth, relieue
my carefull Conſcience,
that am ſadde, diſordered
and diſturbed in
minde for feare of thy
iudgements, and becauſe
I haue diſpleaſed ſo gracious
a God, and louing Father.
               Oh, neuer let my ſoule
be ouertaken with feare ſo
farre as to diſpaire: nor
ouerwhelmed with the Sea
of thy wrath, nor apparailed
with the ſuggeſtions of
Sathan: But let it alwayes
heare the voyce of thy
Blood, ſpeaking better
things then the blood of
Abell, and crying, not for

reuenge, but for pardon,
for me, who by my manifold
tranſgreſſions haue
robbed God of his honour,
the Church of a member,
and my ſoule of life.
               4 Oh man of ſorrowes,
but mirrour of patience:
What a weeke of paynes
was this to thee? What a
good-Friday was that for
mee? What dayes of ſorrowes
were then one after
another to thee? and yet
with what patience didſt
thou paſſe them ouer?
Patient, when Caiaphus ſo
deſpightfully vſed thee:
Patient, when Pilate ſo vnrighteouſlie

iudged thee:
Patient, when falſe Iudas
ſo cunningly, and treacherouſlie
ſaluted thee, and
deſigned thee to be taken.
Againe, patient, when thou
didſt carry thine owne
Croſſe: patient, when the
Crowne of Thornes drew
blood from thy ſacred
head; and patient, when all
others reuiled, reproached,
beſpitted, ſcoffed, and
abuſed thee.
               Oh thou that ſo patiently
& peaceably, mildely, &
meekely, didſt carry painefull
and pangfull, haynous
and heauie ſorrowes for
mee: I beſeech thee, let

thy patience diſcharge my
impatiencie, and let thine
infirmities which thou
didſt truely take, and willingly
beare with ſuch power
& innocency, informe
mine ignorance, comfort
my ſadneſſe, kindle my
loue, diſcharge my feare,
and moderate my anger.
O Lord, grant me patience
to beare thy holy wil in all
things, and giue me grace
in the midſt of all troubles,
yet to continue in thy
feare.
               5 When I deſire grace,
O ſweet Ieſus, to fulfill thy
commandement of Loue

and Charitie, which is the
end of thy commandement,
out of a pure heart,
and of a good conſcience
& of faith vnfained, where
ſhall I take my patterne
but from thee, ſuch a louer
as is Loue himſelfe? for
whom didſt thou not loue?
As for thy Diſciples, thou
didſt loue them as Schollers,
and cheriſh them as
children, and ſtile them thy
friends. Thou didſt ſtoope
downe to waſh their feete,
that were not worthy to
vntye thy Shooe. Thou
diddeſt reſtore Peter, that
had abiured thee: thou
didſt ſaue the Theefe that

dyed with thee: thou didſt
confirme Thomas that douted
of thee: thou didſt forgiue
Iames and Iohn, that
aſked too much of thee.
The bloody perſecutors &
crucifiers, who did curſe
and execrate themſelues &
their children, to doe thee
a miſchiefe, they, euen they
had thine earneſt prayers,
before thou diddeſt either
diſpoſe of thy Mother, o
                     •
                  
pray for thy ſelfe. Yea, that
Iudas that betrayed thee
and ſould thee for thirtie
pence (making no price of
thee, but taking a baſe offer)
thy holy hands did
waſh his vncleane feet, and

thy ſacred lips did touch
his prophane mouth.
               O thou fountaine of
Loue, that doeſt drench
thoſe that loue thee in the
ſtreame of thy pleaſures, &
imbalmeſt euen thine enemies
with the oyle of compaſſion,
and loueſt Mankinde
with an euerlaſting
loue, ſo farre, that after
they had borne armes againſt
thee, thou didſt embrace
them in the armes
of thy Mercy▪ O thou that
didſt grieue till thou mighteſt
dye for me: Thou that
wouldſt be betrayed with a
kiſſe, as it were to meete
death in the middle way:

Thou that didſt reprooue
Peter, when hee diſwaded
thee from it, and didſt haſten
on Iudas, leſt he ſhould
be too ſlacke to bring thee
to it. Kindle, ô kindle my
deſires to thee, inflame my
heart with thankfulneſſe to
thee, inſpire my ſoule with
the fire of zealous loue to
burne alwayes, and flame
vpon the Alter of my hart,
that for thy loue to mee, I
may euermore loue thee
aboue all things, and my
neighbour as my ſelfe.
               6 This is the Conſummatum
eſt, O ſweet Ieſus:
Thou haſt giuen mee that

which thou didſt not owe
mee, and haſt forgiuen me
that which I did owe thee:
Thou waſt content to be
the By-word of the people,
and the curſe of the Law,
for my ſake. Bleſſed be thy
Name; bleſſed be thy Life;
bleſſed be thy death. For
thy death is my birth: thy
crowne of Thornes is my
garland the ſcarres of
thy body, are the ſtarres of
my firmament. Thy gracious
wounds are my happie
plaiſters. Thy bitter
Mirrhe refreſheth me, thine
infirmities ſtrengthen me,
thy ſtripes heale mee, and
thy blood clenſeth me.
               
                  
Loe, I haue nothing to
take to but what I haue
from thee; Therefore Bone
Ieſu, eſto mihi Ieſus, O good
Ieſus make good thy good
name Ieſus vnto mee, and
let thy Paſſion worke compaſſion
for me, that by thy
mercy I may obtaine remiſſion
of my ſinnes, and
by thy merits may obtaine
euerlaſting ſaluation in
the kingdome of
heauen. Amen.
Amen.

that our firſt care may
be to know thy truth: and
let vs ſo profit in the ſchoole

of Chriſt, that in ſicknes we
may finde patience, in priſon
ioy, in pouerty contentment,
& in all things hope.

labours, and the workes of
our hands, and grant vs to
learne ſomething of euery

with thee in the Kingdome

                  O Lord God, thou
iuſt Maſter of
the VINEYARD,
and louing head
of the Church, ſend thy
Spirit into the hearts of all

them that preach or profeſſe
thy holy Truth: all
men religious and ſecular:
yea, men and women, Princes
and ſubiects, rich and
poore, euen all the people
beleeuing in thy Name,
and depending wholy vpon
thee. Giue vnto them
all, O Lord, one Law, one
Baptiſme, one Hope, one
Spirit, that there may be
but one voyce among all
that profeſſe the Catholique
Faith. Keepe backe
the famine of thy Word,
and ſend ſuch labourers
into thy Harueſt, as be
ſound in doctrine, faithfull
in their worke, and godly

in conuerſation, in number
many, and in power
wonderfull.
               Open, we beſeech thee
the hearts and eares of the
people, for the receiuing of
thy word, that ir may dwell
in them plenteouſly, in all
wiſedome, and bring forth
fruit againſt all the cares,
croſſes and courſes of this
wretched world.
               O Lord, thou haſt found
iniquitie in thy Saints, and
the heauens are not cleare
in thy ſight: Oh then correct
vs in thy iudgement,
not in thy furie; leaſt wee
ſhould be conſumed, and
brought to nothing. Purge

the garden of the Church,
and let no Weedes ouergrow
the flowers. Suffer
neither ſinne nor ſuperſtition
to choake the good
growth of faith or manners
in thy people: but keepe
them from all euill, Hereſies,
phanaticall opinions,
ſeducing ſpirits, and deadly
contentions. Keepe our
neckes from the grieuous
yoke of Antichriſtian bondage,
whoſe religion is rebellion,
whoſe faith is faction,
and whoſe practiſe is
the murthering of ſoules
and bodyes: and repreſſe
the furiouſneſſe of Tyrants,
which labour nothing but

the ſpoile of the Church,
and to aboliſh true Doctrine,
Prayer, and pure religion.
O Lord Ieſus, amend
all that is amiſſe,

                  O Almighty God,
king of all kings,
the Fountaine,
Rule, and ſtay
of all Soueraigntie: wee
moſt humbly thanke thee

that thou haſt not left vs
vnto our ſelues, to doe what
ſeemeth beſt in our owne
eyes, but haſt ſet ouer vs a
Noble, Wiſe, and gracious
King, thy ſeruant Iames, our
ſupreame head, next vnder
thee. Lord make all thy
good to goe before him
day and night: vphold his
Crowne, maintaine his
State, giue him continuall
peace, long life, and much
happines. Endue him with
wiſedome and vnderſtanding,
to do ſuch things both
in the Church and Common
wealth, as may be acceptable
in thy ſight, profitable
to his ſubiects, and

hurtfull to none that loue
thy truth. Mercifully heare
him in all his petitions,
and effectually worke for
him in all dangers, in the
day of battell, in his greateſt
conſultations, in the
time of his recreations, in
the plots of Treaſon, and
in the houre of death.
Make vs thankfull for all
thy preſeruations of him,
both at home and abroad,
in this kingdome, and elſe
where. Bleſſe, preſerue and
keepe him, together with
his royall Queene, and the
noble Prince Henry his
ſonne, and the reſt of all
their hopefull Iſſue, that as

they are like Oliue branches,
to his comfort, round
about his Table, ſo they
may be as the tall & goodly
Cedars, for the defence
of this kingdome from all
euill. Let him ſtill imbrace
the truth, and manfully
mainetaine it againſt all
treacherous plots, and ſiniſter
perſwaſions: diſtaſting
(as he hath alwayes done)
both alteration of religion,
and toleration of another.
Let thy power alwayes goe
forth with his armies, and
giue them glorious victories.
Baniſh from his Court
all priuie foes, forraine and
domeſtical, and keepe him

from al ſort of diſſemblers.
               Let not our ſinnes (O
LORD) prouoke thee to
ſhorten his dayes, and depriue
vs of thy good bleſſings,
but conuert vs to thy
good will and pleaſure, and
giue him the crowne of old
age, long and long to continue
in the wayes of righteouſneſſe.
               O holy Father, giue him
ſuch excellent gifts, as be fit
the Maieſtie which he beareth,
that hee may be in
faith like Abraham; in courage
like Dauid; in wiſedome
like Salomon; and in
hearing good and euill, as
an Angell of GOD. Enrich

his Counſell and Nobles
with wiſedome, loyaltie
and fortitude; and make
his ſeruants that ſtand before
him in their ſeuerall
places (with all other ſubiects)
as ſo many lines
drawne to one Center, that
their hearts being tyed vnto
him, they may be alwayes
fearefull to offend,
willing to obay, and faithfull
to accompliſh whatſoeuer
may ſtand with thy
glory, our Kings honour,
and the good of the Common
wealth, for Ieſus
Chriſts ſake, our
onely Lord &
Sauiour,

which haſt the Kings
heart in thy hand, as the

pleaſeth thee: we humbly
beſeech thee, to keepe thy

Vniuerſall Church, and
our Common-wealth, with
peace and proſperitie, in
thy worſhip and Seruice.
Giue (O Lord) grace vnto
our moſt Noble King
Iames, that hee may loue,
honour, feare, and ſerue
thee, & that he may onely
put his truſt in thee. Indue
him with the ſpirit of wiſedome
and knowledge, and
with all other good gifts
& vertues, neceſſary for his
roial function. And eſpecially
enflame his heart with
an earneſt & true zeale, to
ſet forth thy glory, and to
make thy will knowne vnto
all his Subiects, that they

may both with heart and
minde obſerue and keepe
the ſame: and that both he
and al his ſubordinate Magiſtrates
may indifferently
and faithfully miniſter
iudgement and Iuſtice to
all his people.
               Wee beſeech thee (O
Lord) preſerue his body in
health, his minde in quietneſſe,
and both in all ſincerity
and godlineſſe; that by
his good example, hee may
both ſtop the mouthes of
his aduerſaries, and winne
the hearts of all thoſe that
beleeue. Make his dayes (O
Lord) as the dayes of Heauen,
that hee may raigne

many yeeres ouer vs: and
wee his Subiects may long
liue a peaceable and quiet
life, in all godlineſſe and honeſtie,
vnder his ſacred gouernment.
               Graunt vnto him wiſe
and faithfull Councellors,
louing and obedient Subiects,
dutifull and true ſeruants.
Deliuer him (O
Lord) from all Conſpiracies,
Treaſons, and other
dangers, and grant him alwayes
a glorious victorie
ouer all his enemies. Pardon
and forgiue him all his
ſinnes, make him walke all
the dayes of his life in the
way of thy Commaundements,

that he may liue in
thy feare, and die in thy fauour,
and that in the reſurrection
of all fleſh, hee may
receiue a Crowne of righteouſneſſe,
the onely thing
which hee doth wiſh and
hope for, through the merites

thee keepe my body and
ſoule from all tentations,
and ſnares of the I iuell,
and ſuffer not my ſenſes to
range and wander abroad
in matters of pleaſure and
delight, which are to no

from me that which is deformed
by my corrupt nature,
and continue that
which thy GRACE hath
wrought in mee; that hauing
thy whole armour fitted

Let mee not be drawne
away by ſenſualitie, and the
deſires of the fleſh, but giue

that by ſobriety moderation
and abſtinence from
ſuperfluous things, I may

being changed by the renewing

looking for the bleſſed

appearing of my Lord and
Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.
               O Lord holde backe thy
hand in the day of trial, and
lead mee no further into

make mee able to beare.
               Graunt (O Lord) that I
may with ſtrong faith reſiſt

greatnes infinit,
in power omnipotent,
in counſell
wonderful, & in iudgement
terrible; although I

miſerable ſinner, haue by
thy Iuſtice truely deſerued
euerlaſting damnation for
my horrible ſinnes, yet I
beſeech thee, caſt me not
away with him that had not
on a wedding garment, for
I appeale from thy rightfull
iuſtice to thine vnſpeakeable
mercy, & humbly
caſt downe my ſelfe at
thy feete, and beſeech thee
of compaſſion and pardon.
               Beholde Lord, I am a
piece of that purchaſe that
coſt ſo deere a price as the
blood of thy deare Sonne,
my body and ſoule are the
temples of the holy Ghoſt,
the poſtes whereof are

ſprinkled with his precious
blood, which cryeth for
mercie: therefore enter not
into the courſe of iudgement
with me, (for there
I know I ſhall bee ouerthrowen)
but forbeare, forgiue
me, & acquite me, vpon
that ſatisfaction which
he hath made for penitent
ſinners.
               O Lord, though the ſtipend
of my ſinne be death,
and the merit of my
tranſgreſſion eternall perdition,
yet is thy mercy
aboue all thy iudgements,
and thou canſt forgiue
more then I can offend:
wherefore I pray thee, ſet

his Croſſe and paſſion betweene
thy iudgements &
my ſoule: looke vpon mee
with the eye of mercy and
compaſſion, as thou didſt
vpon the ſinfull woman at
the banket, and the Publican
in the Temple, whoſe
pardons are regiſtred in thy
booke for my Comfort.
               O Lord bow downe the
height of thy Deity, to behold
my vileneſſe and miſerie
(a liuely image of the
prodigall ſonne) who know
no other helpe, but onely
thou my moſt louing Father,
whom I haue ſo highly
offended. Powre the oyle
of mercy into my defiled

and fainting heart: ſearch
it, that I may not flatter my
ſelfe, to extenuate my ſin;
cleanſe it, & ſeaſon it with
the Salt of thy grace, to receiue
and retaine all goodneſſe
hereafter. Lord, I
thanke thee, for thy patience
and long ſuffering,
that thou haſt not ſuddenly
(after my deſert) taken
vengeance on me, but giuen
me a longer time of repentance:
wherefore (I beſeech
thee) appeaſe thine
anger towards mee now,
but looſe in me the workes
of darkneſſe, create in me a
new heart, and becauſe
thou lookeſt for my amendment

that I may haue
thy fauour; I beſeech thee
grant mee thy fauour that
I may haue amendment:
giue mee grace to repent
vnfeinedly, with faſting,
weeping, and mourning,
and make my faith liuely
to beleeue that I am forgiuen
in Ieſus Chriſt.
               Let not the faults of my
forefathers light vpon my
head, who haue walked in
their ſinfull ſteppes, neither
be angry with mee for
their ſakes; but let the
wel-doing of Ieſus Chriſt,
who hath ſhed his blood
for mee, ſuccour mee,
and procure my pardon.
               
                  
Forgiue mee all my
ſinnes of youth and age,
negligences and ignorances,
thoughts, words, and
deedes, and keepe me from
preſumptuous ſinnes. O
Lord, looke not vpon the
Phariſee, for hee diſſembleth:
nor vpon the Publicane
firſt, for he ſaith little
for himſelfe in outward
ſhew: nor vpon Mary Magdalen
onely, for ſhe had but
ſeauen diuels: but looke vpon
me, that of ſinners am
chiefe, worſe then either
Phariſee, Publicane or Mary,
who haue as many ſins
as hayres vpon my head,
and a greater clogge vpon

my conſcience then any
burthen that man hath to
beare. O Lord, keepe vnder
Sathan, that he compel
not my troubled Conſcience
to deſpaire, quench all
the motions of my minde,
ſtriuing againſt thy diuine
pleaſure, and reſtore in me
the Image of thy Son, that
I may liue in thy feare, dye
in thy fauour, reſt in thy
peace, riſe in thy power, &
remaine in thy glory, for
Ieſus Chriſts ſake, our
onely Lord and
Sauiour,

of whom is euery
good giuing, and
euery perfect gift,
I beſeech thee to bleſſe me

with al ſpiritual bleſsings in
heauenly things in Chriſt.
Increaſe the little graine of
my weake and feeble faith,
direct it to the true obiect,
the merites of Chriſt Ieſus,
and let it not be bare and
dead, but effectuall, working
by loue. Make mee
ſtrong therein, & conſtant,
to giue credite to thy word,
without doubting, and pro,
tect mee among the diuers
& manifold errours, ſects,
and hereſies of this world,
that fight againſt the foundation.
Lord let me not be
diſappointed of my hope
which I haue in thee, but
make good thy promiſes

vnto mee, and ſo worke in
my heart, that I may haue
courage in conflict, patience
in trouble, & comfort
in al things. Keepe me from
inſolencie and pride, and
graunt mee true humilitie,
and lowlineſſe of mind, that
I be not puffed vp to contemne
my brethren, but
giue mee that due conſideration
of mine owne vileneſſe
and infirmities, that
as duſt and aſhes, I may
tremble and ſtand in awe of
thy iudgements, and as a
ſinfull man, eſteeme better
of others then my ſelfe.
               O deare Father, when Sathan
ſhall accuſe mee, my

conſcience beare witneſſe
againſt mee, the whole
world forſake mee, and all
things ſet themſelues againſt
me for my ſins, then
ſtrengthen mee (I beſeech
thee) in thy faith, that I fall
not from thee: inflame my
colde heart, with the heauenly
affection of vnfained
loue, that I may loue thee,
(O bleſſed Trinitie) with all
that I haue, aboue all, and
my Neighbour as my
ſelfe.
               Graunt me a compaſsionate
& charitable minde,
to help and ſuccour others
to my abilitie, to forbeare
and forgiue them, though

they be mine enemies.
Purge my veines, and ſuffer
not the ſtinking poiſon
of enuy and wrath to infect
my blood: and ſo moderate
my affections that the
Sunne goe not downe vpon
my wrath, but that I may
be ſatiſfied in knowing that
vengeance is thine. Giue
me grace to follow the examples
of all painefull and
godly labouring men, in
matters of my vocation, &
keepe me from the hatefull
ſinne of ſloth and idleneſſe,
the high-way to beggery.
Graunt mee a contented
mind againſt couetouſnes,
amoderate appetite againſt

gluttony and ſurfets: and a
chaſt bodie from diſordered
luſt. Comfort mee (O
Lord) in all grieuous accidents,
and at the point of
death, & giue mee grace to
faſten all thy confidence in
thee, that whereas now I
ſee by Faith onely (as it
were in a glaſſe darkely) I
may then ſee face, to face,
the onely thing which I
deſire and hope for, thorough
Ieſus Chriſt,

                  O Lord God, mercifull
FATHER,
which after the
ſacrament of regeneration
haſt appointed

vs, to receiue oft-ſoones
the bleſſed Sacrament of
thy Supper, for confirmation
of our faith: haue mercy
vpon mee vile wretch,
who for my naturall corruptions,
and manifolde
tranſgreſſions, am not worthy
to approach vnto thy
Table, or come neere thy
houſe.
               Oh gracious God, pardon
me, and diſdaine not
to accept mee into thy fauour,
but forgiue mee all
my ſins that I haue done,
ſaid, or thought, in pride,
wrath, enuy, gluttony, ſloth,
couetouſneſſe, or wantonneſſe:
giue mee a true and

liuely faith, to beleeue thy
word, and the promiſe of
my pardon annexed to thy
Sacraments.
               Inflame mee with loue
& charity towards all men,
to forgiue and forget, to doe
good, to pray for them, that
I may follow the ſteps of my
bleſſed Sauiour. Open the
eies of mine vnderſtanding
and helpe mee to examine
my ſelfe, concerning my
knowledge, faith, and repentance.
Send mee the
hunger and thirſt after this
righteouſneſſe: ſatisfie me
with this heauenly foode▪
make me verily partaker of
all the benefits of his Paſſion.

Oh deare Lord Ieſus,
ſince thou haſt ſuffred ſo
many things for my ſake,
and haſt commanded mee
not to diſpaire, nor diſtruſt
thy goodneſſe, graunt mee
grace to eate of this bread
and drinke of this Cuppe
worthily, that I may continually
remaine in thy
grace and fauour. O Lord
GOD, the FATHER, giue
mee the full conſolation of
this miſterie and commemoration,
that my Faith
may be increaſed, my hope
confirmed, my charitie inflamed,
my weake conſcience
comforted, all dangers
repelled, and my ſoule

aſſured of her ſaluation in
the blood of Chriſt. Let
no prophaneneſſe enter into
my heart, ſo long as I am
about this holy action; but
giue mee grace to receiue
with puritie of heart, and
cleannes of ſoule, with loue
dread, and ſtedfaſt Faith.
Haue mercy vpon mee
good Lord, that by vnworthy
receiuing, I bee not
guilty of his precious body
and blood, who came
downe from heauen, liued
with men, & ſwam through
a red ſea of blood in his agonie
and paſſion, to be my
Redeemer. Haue mercy
vpon the whole Church,

and to this purpoſe haue
mercy vpon this place, and
this company, that they
may ſerue and pleaſe thee
in this holy ſeruice, and all

                  O Almightie God
and merciful father,
I am a ſecret
ſinner; and
my heart is a bottomleſſe
pit of all corruptions:

wilfully and fooliſhly, ignorantly,
& obſtinately haue
I ſinned againſt thee, vnto
whoſe eye all the ſecrets of
my ſoule lie open: but now
I come vnto thee as a ſicke
man vnto the Phyſitian, as
an vncleane man to the well
of mercie & grace, offered
in the precious bloodſhedding
of Ieſus Chriſt, and
repreſented vnto my ſoule
in this bleſſed Sacrament.
Haue mercie vpon mee (O
Lord) haue mercie vpon
me, and forgiue me all the
euill that I am guiltie of:
Giue me grace that I may
diſcerne the Lords body,
and ſo reeciue ie in this Sacrament

with ſuch chaſtitie
of body, humblenes of
minde, thankfulneſſe of
ſoule, hearty contrition,
dread and reuerence, as is
meet for ſo high a myſtery.
               O Lord Ieſus, it is truely
ſaid of thee, that thou didſt
receiue ſinners and eate
with them, and I verily belieue
that thou art the
ſame ſtill, full of goodneſſe
and mercie: wherefore I
beſeech thee, leaue me not
to my ſelfe, reiect mee not
from thy table. Come into
my heart, and purge me
from all filthineſſe of the
fleſh and Spirit. Enter into
my ſoule, ſeale and ſanctifie

mee, both within and
without. O Lord be not angry
with mee a barren and
dry tree, a creature with a
face of braſſe, and heart of
flint: I haue not ſo many
teares as are ſufficient to
waſh thy feete with Mary
Magdalen, but thou haſt
ſhed as much of thine own
blood, as ſufficeth to waſh
away all the ſinnes of mee,
and all the world: then be
not angry with me, ô Lord,
but let thy grace ſupply
my wants, let thy mercy
pardon my ſins, let thy holy
ſpirit prepare my ſoule,
thy merits inrich my pouertie,
and thy moſt precious

blood waſh away all the
ſpots of my life, that I may
worthily receiue this heauenly
Sacrament: ſo that I
may be ſtrengthened therby,
and throughly filled
with the heauenly food of
thy body and blood: for the
mortification of the olde
man, the confirmation of
my faith, and the finall ſaluation
of my ſoule: O Lord
heare my prayers, and
grant my requeſts
I beſeech thee,
Amen.

                  O Lord God, thou
Keeper of Iſrael,
who preſerueſt
our going out,
and our comming in, into

thy handes I commit my
ſelfe, and all that I haue,
whether I be at home or abroad.
In the Name of him
that was wearied in his
iourney, and ſate downe
vpon the Wel, euen Chriſt
Ieſus, I beſeech thee to direct
my paths in this my
iourney, as thou didſt Iacob
in his Voyage too and
from Haran, Ionas at Sea,
and in the Whales belly,
and the children of Iſrael
when they paſſed ouer Iordan.
Graunt mee health,
giue me ſtrength and courage,
and alſo refreſh mee
when I am weary: keepe me
from the hands of ſpoylers,

the ſleights and deceits of
theeues and robbers, from
ſauage beaſts and euil workers
Graunt that whereſoeuer
I come, I may alwaies
find godly men, which may
honeſtly entertaine & curteouſly
entreat mee. Keepe
mee from lewde company,
that I caſt not in my lotte
with them, to be partaker
of their wickednes: but let
me alwayes haue thy feare
before mine eyes, to auoid
all wandring pathes, knowing
that wherſoeuer I walk,
thou ſpieſt out al my waies.
               Shew mee (ô Lord) in
the day time thy comfortable
Pillar of Cloud, and

in the night thy Pillar of
fire; that both day and
night I may eſcape the
hands of all mine enemies,
and they likewiſe may be afraid
to attempt any thing
againſt me, when they ſhall
ſee thy wonderfull protection
of mee. Yet Lord, if
thou haſt ſo appointed, that
before I returne, I muſt goe
to my long home, and dye
in this voyage, I beſeech
thee, that vpon whatſoeuer
this veſſell of my body be
ſplit, or whereſoeuer this
Tabernacle fall, yet my
ſoule may be ſafe, and arriue
at the euerlaſting land
of Promiſe, the common

Home of the Elect.
               Make me partaker of all
good prayers, and giue me
grace likewiſe to remember
that duetie for all my
brethren. Furniſh me with
neceſſaries while I ſhall be
abroad, giue mee bread to
eate, and clothes to put on▪
and when I ſhall haue finiſhed
my buſineſſe, LORD
bring mee home againe, (if
it be thy will,) and ſhew me
this fauour, that I may find
my friends and fauourers,
wife, children and Family,
in perfect health at my returne
for Ieſus Chriſts
ſake, Amen.

                  O Eternall GOD,
which ſhutteſt,

and openeſt
& no man ſhutteth,

my humble requeſt vnto
thee, is for my ſelfe, and all
ſuch as ſuffer any croſſe or
affliction in body or mind,
that it would pleaſe thee to
open ſuch ſpeedy way and
meanes, as they may be eaſed
and deliuered from the
ſame.
               O Lord, in this affliction,
which doth ſo grieuouſly
pierce my ſoule, I beſeech
thee, giue mee grace
to acknowledge it thy Fatherly
correction for my
ſinne, that I may learne to
be more carefull of my dutie
to thee. I thanke thee,
that thou haſt laid no more
vpon me, nor puniſhed me

to my confuſion: I beſeech
thee grant mee a more patient
minde, and ſtay thy
hand in due time, that I
may recouer my ſtrength
with comfort in thee. All is
thine, and thou art all; to
thee therefore doe I flie for
ſuccour, becauſe there is
no ſuccour but vnder thy
wings. The ſorrowes of hell
doe compaſſe me round about,
the feare of death is
before mine eyes: helpe, ô
helpe mee; ſaue me, oh ſaue
me, for thine owne ſake, for
thy SONNES ſake, for
thy glories ſake, for I am
the workemanſhip of thy
hands.
               
                  
Keepe my ſenſes, vnder,
ſtanding and iudgement,
and ſaue mee from euery
conceite that tendeth to
feare, furie, or diſtruſt in
thy mercie. O Lord, aduiſe
and teach mee wiſedome
and moderation in
my griefe, yea, with thy
power ouer-rule mee that it
be not my ouerthrow.
               Of thy mercy, LORD,
comfort the appalled conſciences
of all thoſe that
grieue vnder the burthen
of their ſinnes, fearing the
heauineſſe of thy wrath for
the ſame Haue mercie vpon
all thoſe whoſe tender
affections are too neerely

touched with the loſſe of
their companions, children
or friends, & let them not
take any thing to heart, otherwiſe
then may ſtand
with diſcretion, reaſon, and
Chriſtian moderation.
               Giue thy comforts and
conſolations vnto all thoſe
that by any meanes ſuffer
trouble or torments, for
the profeſſion of thy Goſpel,
of the ſeruice of their
Prince. And if it pleaſe
thee to detaine ſome vnder
a longer Croſſe, for thy
greater glory, of their further
tryall? yet Lord; let
them not be tempted aboue
their ſtrength, but

arme them with further
patience and hope in thee,
that ſo they may perſeuere
vnto the end. O Lord, weaken
the power of Sathan, &
the tiranny of his miniſters,
which eyther by inward
tentations or outward violence,
haue bred the woe of
thy ſeruants, and ridde thy
ſeruants from all their
troubles, that they may
ſing ioyfull praiſes vnto
thee, through Ieſus
Chriſt, Amen.

and who amongſt other euils

we beſeech thee, take this

and as the ſtench of our

in it: ſo let our humble ſupplications
vpon our knees,
come before thee to procure
our happy releaſe
from it.
               Lord, call back thine angel,
& cauſe him to ſheath
the ſword againe. Wee are
thy children, and the worke
of thy hands: wee are ſorry
for our ſinnes, which are
the cauſe of all this, and

wee purpoſe amendment:
wee are but Men, duſt and
Aſhes, wee are not able to
beare long, therefore Lord,
haue mercy vpon vs, and

our ſorrowes, and ſend
vs comfort, and ſuffer vs
not to periſh after ſo miſerable

               We thanke thee, ô Lord
that thou haſt not left vs
altogether comfortles, nor
caſt vs off without hope, but
haſt ſomewhat with drawne

hundreds of vs, in compariſon
of thoſe whom thou
ſleweſt a little before: and
wee reioyce at this abatement,

yet wee ſtand in awe:
wee preſume vpon this thy
fauour, but with feare and
trembling: wee truſt it ſhall
be euery day better, yet we
are carefull to winne it by
pleaſing thee. Wherefore,
(ô Lord) wee beſeech thee
bleſſe vs and all thoſe that
depend vpon vs: ſet thy ſauing
marke vpon our houſes,
as thou diddeſt for the
Iſraelites in Egypt; & giue
order to the deſtroyer that
hee hurt vs not. Put thy

guard our regard which

thy good bleſſing make the
preſeruatiues of the Phyſitians,

& ourſhifting places

               Giue vs grace (ô Lord)
that we truſt not too much
in outward meanes, but
onely in thy mercie, and
bleſſing vpon them. Keepe
vs in our downe lying, and
vp-riſing, and protect vs
walking in our vocations.
Haue pittie vpon our diſtreſſed
brethren, comfort

               The ancient Prayer,
called, O bountifull
IESV.
               
                  O BOVNTIFVLL
Ieſu,
ô ſweet Ieſu:
ô IESV, the
Sonne of the
Virgin Mary, which art full
of mercy and truth: ô ſweet
Ieſu, haue pittie vpon mee,
according to thy great mercie.

O benigne Ieſu, by
the ſame precious blood
which thou waſt content to
ſhed vpon the Altar of the
Croſſe for vs miſerable
ſinners: I beſeech thee,
vouchſafe to caſt all mine
iniquities out of thy ſight,
and deſpiſe not mee who
thus humbly beg of thee,
crying and calling vpon
thy holy Name Ieſus. This
Name Ieſus, is a ſweet Name:
this Name Ieſus is a Name
of Saluation: for what is Ieſus
but a Sauiour?
               O good Ieſus, which haſt
created me and redeemed
me with thine owne blood,
ſuffer not mee whom thou

haſt made of nought, to
be damned. O good Ieſus,
let not my wickedneſſe
haue power to deſtroy me,
whom thine Almightie
goodneſſe hath made. O
good IESV, reknowledge
that which is thine in mee,
and that which is not of
thee, take that away from
mee. O good Ieſus, euen
now while the time of mercie
is, haue mercie vpon
me, and let me not be confounded
at the time of thy
fearefull iudgement.
               O good IESVS, although
I vile ſinner, by
thy ſtreight Iuſtice, haue
deſerued to be puniſhed

euerlaſtingly, for my moſt
grieuous ſins, yet hauing
ſure confidence in the truth
of thy righteouſneſſe, I appeale
to thine vnſpeakeable
mercy: I am ſure thou
wilt haue mercy vpon mee,
like a louing Father, and a
mercifull Lord.
               O good IESVS, what
profit is there in my blood,
if I deſcend into the pit of
eternall corruption? For
ſurely they that be dead
ſhall not magnifie thee, nor
any that goe downe into
the place of ſilence. O moſt
mercifull Ieſu haue mercy
vpon mee: ô moſt ſweet Ieſus
deliuer mee. O moſt

holy Ieſus, be mercifull vnto
me a ſinner.
               O IESVS, accept mee
wretched ſinner, among
the number of them whom
thou haſt elected to ſaluation.
O Ieſus, the health of
all that hope in thee, the
life of all that beleeue in
thee, haue mercie vpon me.
O ſweet Ieſus, the remiſſion
of all my ſinnes. O Ieſus,
the Sonne of the Virgin
Mary, powre thy grace into
my heart, endue mee with
wiſedome, charitie, chaſtitie
and humilitie, and in all
mine aduerſitie, grant me
a holy, inuiolable and ſtedfaſt
patience, that I may

perfectly loue thee, and
haue my onely delight

Spaniſh Nauy, ſent to inuade
ENGLAND,
Anno 1588.
               
                  MOſt omnipotent
Creator
Redeemer,
and Conſeruer.
When
it ſeemed moſt fit time to

thy worthy Prouidence to
beſtow the workmanſhip
of this worlds Globe: with
thy rare iugdement, thou
didſt diuide, into foure ſingular
parts, the forme of
all this Mold, which aftertime
hath tearmed Elements:
all they ſeruing to
continue in orderly Gouernment
of all the maſſe.
Which all, when of thy
moſt ſingular bountie, and
neuer yerſt ſeene care, thou
haſt this yeere made ſerue
for inſtruments to daunt
our foes, and to confound
their malice. I moſt humbly
with bowed heart, and
bended knees, doe render

my humblieſt acknowledgments,
and lowlieſt thanks.
And not the leaſt; for that
the weakeſt Sexe hath been
ſo fortified by thy ſtrongeſt
helpe, that neither my people
need finde lacke by my
weakneſſe, nor Forreiners
tryumph at my ruine: Such
hath beene thy vnwonted
grace in my DAYES;
as though Sathan hath neuer
made Holy-day, in
practiſing for my life and
ſtate: yet thy mightie hand
hath ouerſpread both with
the ſhade of thy wings, ſo
that neither hath beene ouerthrowen,
nor receiued
ſhame, but abide with bleſſing,

to thy moſt glory, and
their greateſt ignominy.
For which, Lord, of thy
meere goodneſſe, graunt vs
grace to be hourely thankfull,
and euer mindfull. And
if it may pleaſe thee to pardon
my requeſt, giue vs thy
continuance in my dayes,
of like goodneſſe; that my
yeares neuer ſee change of
ſuch grace to me, but eſpecially
to this my kingdome:
which LORD graunt (for
thy Sonnes ſake) may
flouriſh many ages
after my end,
Amen.

Prayer for the ſucceſſe of her

                  MOſt omnipotent
MAKER and
GVIDER of all
Worlds Maſſe,
that onely ſearcheſt and
fadomeſt the bottome of
all hearts-conceits, and

of all actions intended:
Thou that by thy foreſight
doeſt truely diſcerne,
how no malic of reuenge,
nor quittance of iniurie,
nor deſire of bloodſhed,
nor greedines of lucre hath
bred the reſolution of our
now ſet-out Armie, but
a heedfull care, and a wary
watch, that no neglect of
foes, nor ouerſuertie of
harme, might breed either
danger to vs, or glory to
them.
               Theſe being the grounds,
thou that didſt inſpire the
mind, we humbly beſeech
thee with bended knees,
proſper the worke, and with

the beſt fore-windes, ſpeed
the Iourney, giue the victorie,
and make the returne

glory, the trump of thy
Fame, and ſuertie of thy

Keeper and
Guider. Inurement
of thy rare
ſeene, vnuſed, and ſeeldheard-of
goodnes powred
in ſo plentifull ſort vpon vs
full oft, breeds now this
boldnes to craue with bowed
knees, and hearts of humilitie,
thy large hand of
helping-power to aſſiſt with

wonder our iuſt cauſe, not
founded on prides motion,
nor begun on malice-ſtock,
but as thou beſt knoweſt
(to whom nought is hid)
grounded on iuſt defence
from wrongs, hate, and
bloody deſire of conqueſt.
               For ſithens means thou
haſt imparted to ſaue that
thou haſt giuen, by inioying
of ſuch a people, as
ſcornes their blood-ſhed,
where ſafetie ours is none.
Fortifie, deare GOD, ſuch
hearts in ſuch ſort, as their
beſt part may be worſt, that
to the trueſt part meant
worſt, with leaſt loſſe to
ſuch a Nation as deſpiſe

their liues for their Countryes
good. That all forraine
Lands may laud and
admire the omnipotencie
of thy worke, a fact alone
for thee onely to performe.
So ſhal they name be ſpred
for wonders wrought, and
the faithfull encouraged to
repoſe in thy vnfellowed
grace: and we that minded
nought but right, be in chained
in thy bonds for perpetuall
ſlauery, and liue & die

for ſuch obtained fauour.
Warrant deare Lord
all this with thy

euermore hold faſt the bleſſed
hope of eternall life.
               Mortifie and kill all vice
in me, that my life may expreſſe
my Faith in thee:
mercifully heare the humble
ſute of thy ſeruant, and
grant me thy peace all my
daies, graciouſly pardon all
mine infirmities, and defend

mee in all dangers of
body, goods or name, but
moſt chiefly my ſoule againſt
all aſſaults, temptations,
accuſations, ſubtile
ſleights, and baites of that
old enemie of mankind Sathan,

Children or Seruants, and
aide me (ô Lord) with thy

gouerne, nouriſh, and bring
them vp in thy feare and

               Caſt a gracious eye vpon

directing hand, that the labour
and paines which I
am to vndertake this day,
may proſper and let all my

Iames, the Queene his wife,

Henry, and all their Children,
alwaies in thine owne

                  O Lord God which
haſt ſaid, If any
man lacke wiſedome,
let him aske of GOD,
(which giueth to all men liberally,
and reprocheth no
man,) and it ſhall be giuen

him. I beſeech thee, breath
into my Soule the Spirit
of Vnderſtanding, that in
my childe-hoode, I may
learne; and as I grow further
into yeares, practiſe
the ſtudy of thoſe things
only, that are agreeable to
thy lawes. Haue mercy vpon
me, & lighten mine vnderſtanding
with the beams
of thy diuine wiſedom, that
I may haue iudgement to
make the beſt choiſe, witt
and capacitie to conceiue,
and memorie to retaine &
beare away all ſuch good
things as I ſhall either heare
or read.
               Lord, hew and ſquare the

rough table of my heart,
prepare it, and make it
ſmooth & fit to receiue into
it the impreſſions of
thy diuine grace and wiſedome.
Graunt that I may
carefully ſeek for the pearls
of true knowledge, and obediently
ſubmit my ſelfe
to all thoſe that are my teachers,
and haue the ouerſight
of mee. Giue me ſuch
a deſire to attaine vnto
knowledge, that my ſtudy
through thy working, may
be a pleaſure vnto me, and
that I may not wilfully loſe
or vainely beſtow that precious
time, which neuer
can be called againe. Poure

into mee thy holy Spirit,
that all my trauell & paines
in ſtudy being bleſſed by
thee, I may plentifully reap
the fruit of my labours, and
be thankfull vnto thee.
               O louing Father, be thou
my Schoole-maiſter, to inſtruct
mee, and let all my
ſtudies be referred to the
right end, that I be neither
infected with Hereſie, nor
partaker of any Sect or
Schiſme. Lord, when I ſhall
haue attained vnto any
meaſure of knowledge, let
it not puffe me vp to ſtand
high in mine owne conceit,
or be proude of thy gifts;
but let mee be wiſe vnto

ſobrietie, and cary my ſelfe
humbly, lowly, and modeſtly;
and ſo order all my
ſtudies & endeauors, good
Father, that I may firmely
reſolue, ſpeedily be, and
conſtantly continue in performing
any thing that is
agreable to thy will, that ſo
euery thing may ſerue mee
for the furtherance to a
godly and vertuous life, &

with ſighes, and my plants
watered with teares: to thee
I hold vp my hands, to thee
I lift vp my heart, to thee
I pray, requiring thee of
mercie. O Lord, what ſhall
I deſire of thee, that deſerue

nothing at thy hands? what
can I hope for, that am euen

haſt ſaid, Shall not my ſoule
be auenged on ſuch a one as

elſe where, I will haue mercy
on him that could finde no

let the power of thy Sons

               O Lord heare mee ſpeedily,
if thou doe not, then I
am out of hope; my conſcience

accuſeth me, my memory
giues euidence againſt

mee. My ſpirit is
weary of this bondage, and
I haue bid my life farewell.
My conſcience is clogged,
when I behold the bloody
wounds of my ſoule: the
voyce of ioy and mirth is
gone from me: I am deepely
plunged in diſcomfort, I
haue neither worth to appeaſe
thy wrath, nor patience
to endure thy indignation.
I pray thee therefore
ſend the comfort of thy holy
Spirit into my heart, and
ſtrengthen my faith, that I
be not ſwallowed vp with

ouer much heauineſſe. O
Lord let thy Maieſtie appeare
in thy mercy, forgiue
my ſinnes, the vnhappy
ground of all this woe, and
I am recouered of all mine
infirmities. Trye not the
lawe with mee, leſt I come

wherein I ſeeke reliefe, as
Prayer, Conference, Reading,
and hearing of thy
holy WORD. Moderate
and mitigate my vexation,

Take away this Cup from

not in the death of a

pittie, and helpe me in this
day of Viſitation. Poure
thine oyle of grace into my
wounded conſcience, purge
my defiled ſoule, forgiue

competent comfort & conſolation
in this diſtreſſe. Let
me not dye ere I begin to

liue, giue mee time to repent,
& occaſion to amend.
But if thou wilt needs put
any more of thy wine of
correction into my feſtred
ſores, lay no more, (ô Lord)
lay no more vpon me, then
I ſhalbe able to beare▪ make
good vnto mee that goodneſſe,
which thou haſt granted
mee vnder the great
Seale of thy promiſe. Supplie

Lord) a penitent heart for
the time paſt, and promiſe
through thy grace amendment,

if it ſhall pleaſe thee
to draw out the thread of
my life any longer: yet I
neither deſire the continuance
of this mortalitie, nor
a more ſpeedy deliuerance,
otherwiſe then as thou wilt.
Lord looke not vpon my
merits, for they are either
none, or not good: nor
vpon my life, for it hath
been naught: but looke vpon
Chriſt, thy deare Sonne,
who from the Altar of the
Croſſe cryed vnto thee on
my behalfe, and accept his
ſatisfaction for my ſinnes.
               Arme mee with patience
to take vp my Croſſe, and
follow thee, euen to beare

thy viſitation willingly: and
giue mee ſtrength by faith,
to reſiſt the aduerſarie in

be gone foorth, as it was to

to put in order my things
of this world, that I may
depart in more peace: and

when the pangs of death
haue ſhut vp the eies of my

               Theſe things (O Lord)
I enioy, though vnworthy,
by thy goodneſſe: whereas
there be many that haue
not found the like fauour
at thy hands, Bleſſed be
thy Name therefore. And
yet ô Lord, thou haſt been
much more gracious vnto
me: thy Spirituall fauours
and thy Caeleſtial bleſſings
exceed all theſe. Therefore
as I am bound, ſo,
much more I bleſſe thee,

that thou didſt elect me before
all worlds to glorie:
that thou didſt worke my
redemption by the blood
of Chriſt Ieſus in his bitter
Paſſion: that I was borne
in the light of the Goſpel,
to know thee, and through
Sanctification in thee, haue
had the grace to take vpon
mee the profeſſion of the
Truth, to abandon all Superſtition
and Hereſie, to
doe good vnto any, and to
doe any thing that may
doe good, either publike
or priuate, & in ſome meaſure
to keepe my ſelfe vnſpotted
of the world.
               Oh, what ſhall I giue

vnto my Lord, that hath
done ſo great and mightie
things for mee? O Lord,
I giue thee thanks that thou
haſt giuen mee ſuch an honourable
Calling and vocation
of Chriſtianitie, that
thou haſt incorporated me
a member of the Church,
giuing me ſuch a gracious
portion of Faith, hope,
loue, zeale, patience, peace
and ioy, the beginnings of
Regeneration.
               What am I (O Lord)
that thou haſt granted mee
ſuch things? to receiue
ſuch profite by the preaching
of thy Word, and the
Priuiledge of thy bleſſed

Sacraments; to bee waſhed
with thy blood, to ſit at thy
Table, and to feed on thee
the euerlaſting Bread?
               Theſe I thanke thee for,
and for theſe alſo; euen for
my part which I haue in
the Communion of Saints;
for the benefit which I haue
of their Prayers in the
Church militant, the ayde
of their counſels, with the
pleaſure and comfort of
their godly examples, for
the bettering of my life:
that thou haſt giuen me a
care to vſe a good Conſcience
in dealings in this
world, and an earneſt deſire
to continue ſo ſtill: yea, rather

to grow better.
               And in fine, I cannot
forget (O Lord,) thy mercy
of longanimitie and patience
towards mee: That
thou haſt granted mee ſo
long and ſo large a time
of Repentance, and haſt
vouchſafed mee therein,
to haue thy Sonne IESVS
Chriſt, for my Mediatour,
by whoſe interceſſion my
Prayers haue acceſſe▪ vnto
thee, and receiue their happy
anſweres.
               I prayſe thee, I glorifie
thee, I worſhip thee, I magnifie
thy bleſſed Name, O
Lord, by whoſe goodneſſe
I want nothing fitte for a

Chriſtian; nor any thing
that may fit mee for Heauen:
where, I thanke thee,
for making ſo glorious a
prouiſion, and ſuch a gracious
preparation for my
Soule, and whither I beſeech
thee to bring me, O
my GOD, in thy due time,
and in the meane time to
continue thy goodneſſe vnto
mee, for Ieſus Chriſt
ſake, my onely Sauiour
and Redeemer.
Amen.
