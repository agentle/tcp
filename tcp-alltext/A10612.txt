               MIchael Renichon of Templeu, and Parſon
of Boſsier in the County of Namur
aforeſaid (diſpatched with Letters of the
Earle of Barlaymont, in the habite of a
Souldier, from Bruſſel, the tenth day of
March laſt:) was by Convoy conducted
thence to Louen, Dieſt, Herentals, and
Tuernoult: from whence accompanied
onely with one of the garriſon of the ſayd
Towne, he was guided to the Towne of Bredau: where being
entred, he deliuered certaine cloſe ſealed Letters, vnto the Gouernour
there, which were addreſſed from the Earle of Barlaymont
vnto Captayne Larigon Commaunder of the Caſtle of
Tuernoult, importing, that the bringer thereof, was ſent thither
by expreſſe commaundement of Archduke Erneſtus of Auſtria,
to communicate vnto him a certaine enterpriſe, to be done
vpon the towne of Bredau.
            
            The Gouernour deſirous to be by him further inſtructed, as
well of the cauſe of his comming thither, as of the particularities
of the ſaid enterpriſe: Renichon firſt humbly besought him,
that it would pleaſe him to entertaine him into his ſeruice, and
then, perſiſting (though differing and dubling in his aſſertions,
which ſauored of manifeſt vntruethes) that his matter was iuſt
and perfect: Affirmed, that for certaine yeares, he had bene Secretary
to the Abbot of Malonne, and for his knowledge and experience,
he was by him aduaunced to the ſame place, with the
Earle of Barlaymont: from whome hee had after thys manner
withdrawen himſelfe, onely for the feruent deſire hé had to doe
him ſeruice, with ſuch other the like accomplements.
            The Gouernour finding ſmall probability in hys filed ſpeeches,
feared greatly ſome pretence of waightier matter: and for
that cauſe, cauſed him forthwith to be conveighed to the Haghe:
Where, vpon the firſt of Aprill, (fearing what would enſue) he
attempted to ſtrangle himſelfe with a corde made of points and
ſtringes of his Armes, faſtened to a certayne iron in the Gaole,
vnder which he was found all be blouded, and ſpeechleſſe.
            Reuiued now, and come to his ſpeech agayne, one demaunded
for what cauſe he would haue committed this acte vpon himſelfe:
whereunto replying, hee confeſſed volontarily, without

proffer of any torture or conſtraint, as well by word of mouth,
on the ſecond of Aprill, as alſo afterward by his owne hand writing
at ſundry times, as namely on the twentieth day of Aprill,
and laſt of May, the very abſolute trueth of hys comming thither:
affirming the ſpeeches vttered by him and fathered vppon
the Abbot of Malonne, and Earle of Barlaymont, to bee falſe
and forged, acknowledging further.
            That hauing had long proceſſe in Law againſt his Pariſhioners
of Boſsier, touching the reuenues of his Parſonage: as alſo
endamaged through the dayly incurſions of the vnbrideled
ſouldiours: he was enforced by meere neceſſity about ſome two
yeares ſithence, to abandon his Parſonage, and committing the
cure thereof vnto a Chaplaine, retired himſelfe vnto the Towne
of Namours, where he ſupplied the roome of a Scholemaſter.
            The Earle of Barlaymont, hauing had ſome intelligence of
my being there, entreated me by ſome of hys gentlemen, on an
Euening to ſuppe with him: ſupper being ended, the Earle retired
himſelfe into hys Chamber, and commaunded me to bee
brought in to him: where (his people withdrawen) he asked me
how I could with ſo ſmall allowance content my ſelf, and ſpend
my time, to ſo little proffite, adding further, that hee knew the
meanes how to aduaunce my eſtate, if eyther I would ſeeke it
at his handes, or rouſe and plucke vp my appaled ſpirites, for
which his honourable courteſies, humbly thanking him, I preſented
him my beſt ſeruice.
            The which now preſented, hee tooke occaſion to ſend for me
in February laſt paſt, by his Chaplaine after ſupper, falling in
diſcourſe with me, in the preſence of ſome other, of an enterpriſe
to be done vpon the Towne of Bredau.
            
            Likewiſe at an other time being entred into his Chamber, he
ſent for me againe, at which time he tolde mee, that hee was to
communicate vnto me a matter of greater conſequence and importance,
and that if I would employ my ſelfe in the ſeruice of
the king, he would richly and royally recompence me. Vppon
which promiſe, I vowed my ſeruice to him againe.
            Not long after this, I was by him commaunded to follow him
to Bruſſels, where the ſayd Earle diuers and ſondry times frequenting
the Court, at length commanded me to attend on him
thither: with whome paſſing from chamber to chamber, at laſt,

the Earle entred the chamber of the Archduke Erneſtus: whom
I then beheld, minding to follow after hym: at which tyme I
was partly hindered by the ſuddaine falling too of the doore:
which not fully ſhut, (liſtening what might paſſe betwéene the
Archduke and the ſayd Earle,) I eaſely heard them ſpeake Spaniſh
and Latine: and at ſundry times, make repetition of recompence
and reward: The Earle ready to take hys leaue of the
Duke, who brought him to the chamber doore: the Duke at
his laſt farewell, ſayd, Cumulate & largo foenore ſatisfaciam.
When the Earle returned, he told mee, that they had all
that time, conferred about my matters: and that the Archduke
had ordained two hundred Phillips Dollors to be deliuered me.
            Retired now to his lodging, he gaue me further to vnderſtand
that the Archdukes pleaſure and full intention was, to roote out,
or by a third hand violently to murther the Counte Maurice of
Naſſau: and for that end and purpoſe, he had already diſpatched
certaine other perſons, aſſuring me, that if I would likewiſe vndertake
the like action, it ſhould be great aduauncement for me
and all my fréendes: ſaying further, that there were allready
fiftéene thouſand crownes gathered together, to bee disburſed to
him, that firſt ſhould bring to paſſe the foreſaid maſſacre or murther.
            Vppon this point I aunſweared the Earle, that it was an
action méerely impertinent to my profeſſion, who had neuer
borne armes: he replied that it was the will and pleaſure of the
king, and the commaund of the Archduke, and therewithall, fell
to perſwading me agayne wyth many vehement reaſons, in ſuch
ſort, as I promiſed to do my vttermoſt endeuor to that ende.
            Therevppon I deſired the ſaid Earle, to inſtruct mee. how I
might behaue my ſelfe in this enterpriſe: hee aunſweared, that
the Counte Maurice being a yong noble man, very familiar and
popular, it were a very eaſie matter to inſinuate himſelfe in hys
fauor: that it muſt not bee wrought in haſt or raſhly, but wyth
great aduiſe and leyſure, That he was to make hys repaire into
the Haghe, or ſuch other place where the Counte were moſt reſtant:
that there, he ſhould vnder the coullour of teaching a common
ſchoole, expect and waight for the comming of ſuch other as
were aſſigned to the like ende and purpoſe (whereof there were
ſix and he was the ſeauenth, who taking aduiſe and councell together▪
               
vppon one obſeruation made, might eaſely woorke the
depth of their deſire: aduiſing me further, that I was to prouide
my ſelfe of a paire of good Piſtols, with firelockes, the which (biting
carefully and clenly kept) I ſhould charge with two or thrée
bullets, and vpon the firſt occaſion proffered, ſhould ſhoot through
the ſaid Counte, or otherwiſe murther hym▪ by what deuyſe or
practiſe I either beſt could my ſelfe: or the other which yet were
to repayre vnto me. In concluſion affirming, that hee who beſt
and firſt behaued himſelfe in this action, ſhould be best and firſt
rewarded.
            That there were alſo other, which were to be made away by
like practiſe, videlicet, Barneuelt, Longolius, and S. Allegonde:
of whome, or any of them, if he could procure their death and deſtruction:
he ſhould bee richly likewiſe recompenced, charginge
him eſpecially to alter his name, and to apparell himſelfe ſouldiorlike for this purpoſe.
            These and ſuch other exhortations ended, the Counte Barlaymont
cauſed certayne other perſons to bee brought into my
preſence: of whome, he ſaid that one of them, was of the ſix aboue
mentioned: to whome he declared that I was lately adopted into
their fellowſhip: vpon which ſpéech, the ſaid party embracing
me, called me his Camerado: aſſuring me that in ſhort time, he
would follow me into Holland, for and vpon the like occaſions.
            The ſaid Countie further declared, that the ſayde ſixe perſons
are, and haue bene euer ſince the death of the Prince of Parma,
and before, notorious murtherers, and that they are allowed
gentlemens pay in the Court there, by the King, and vppon any
ſuch deſperate action, are onely and euer employed againſt the
ennemy.
            Thus retyring himſelfe from our company, he diſpatched hys
Secretary incontinently to Stephen de Narra, of whome he receiued
in ſundry kindes of quoyne, the foreſayde ſomme of two
hundred Dollars, the which was preſently by him deliuered me.
            Being now furniſhed of all things expedient for my iourney,
and ready to depart from Bruſſels to Andwerpe, I was by one
of the ſixe perſons aboue mencioned, conducted to the Schuite,
who at my very departure ſignified vnto mee, that hee aſſuredly
hoped to haue borne me company to Leiden: of whom demaunding
where that was, and to what ende: hee aunſweared me,

that Leiden was a Towne and an Vniuerſity in Holland, wher
the younge Prince of Orange ſtudied, whether hee ſhould likewiſe
be employed, to the intent that inſinuating himſelfe into
his fauor, he might with better conveniency bereaue hym of hys
life.
            Thus reſolued to obey the Counte of Barlaymonts pleaſure
and commaund, I first cloathed my ſelfe ſouldierlike, named my
ſelfe Michil de Triuier, and arriued at Andwerpe with the forſaid
Letters of the County of Barlaymont, addreſſed to Largion,
where (vnderſtanding that he was vpon occaſions departed from
Tuernault) I was enforced to alter my courſe, and returned to
Bruſſels againe: where receiuing other Letters of the foreſaide
County, tooke my way to Louen, Dieſt, Herentals, and Tuernault,
from whence as aforeſaid, I came to Bredau.
            
            The generall Eſtates of the vnited Prouinces of the Low-Countries,
duely examining the ſtate of this cauſe, finding it a
matter of very euill example, as alſo, that in a Country of Iuſtice,
where all daungerous and perillous actions and euentes
ought to be preuented, and the peace and tranquillity of the ſame
highly preferred and aduaunced, eſtéemed it in their wiſedomes
a matter not onely not tollerable, but rather ſeuerely to bee puniſhed,
to the terror and example of all other: and therevppon
haue condemned and adiudged, and doe by theſe preſentes condemne
and iudge the Author of this intended murther, to be preſently
conveighed from hence to the ordinary place of execution,
and there to be beheaded with the ſword: and afterwardes, hys
body to be quartered, his head to bee put vppon a pole, and the
quarters hanged on the foure corners of the Haghe, declaring
further his goods to be confiſcated.
             This was pronounced in the Audience of the Court of Holland,
the third of Iune 1594. And Signed Nieuelt.
            
            Vnder that was written, The Decree of the foreſaid Councel.
And was ſubſcribed. I. van zuilon.
