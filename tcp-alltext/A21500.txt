The arrerages wherof, beſides the perpetuall payment amounteth to greate ſummes of money. And although the kinges moſt royal maieſtie hath ben by a longe tyme in good hope and truſt, that the ſaid frenche kyng, with gentle and frendly admonitions (whiche hath not lacked) wolde not onely haue deſiſted from intelligence with the ſayde Turke: but alſo payed and ſatyſfied the ſayde pencion. Yet neuertheleſſe his hyghnes nowe perceyuing, that the ſayde frenche kyng wyll not be induced by any gentle meanes, to honeſtie and reaſon, but ſtyll perſiſte and be obſtinate againſt his leage fydelitie othe and honour, moſt ſpecially conſideryng the common cauſe of chriſtendom, and next wayeng his maieſties iuſt tytle to the crowne of Fraunce and other Dukedomes and dominions vniuſtly withholden by the ſaide frenche kynge, for recompence whereof the ſayde pencion was graunted: Hath therfore entred into a mooſt chriſten and ſtrayte leage and amitie with his good brother and perpetual alie the Emperours maieſtie, who ioyntly together, as well for the cauſes aforeſayde, as for other good groundes and occaſions towchyng their pryuate affaires, haue intimate warre to the ſame frenche kyng, he fyrſt refuſyng to receiue their harroldes, whiche were ſent to him to offer honorable and reaſonable conditions of peace, whiche conditions haue alſo bene declared to the frenche kynges ambaſſadour here reſident, and no conuenyent nor reaſonable aunſwere made to the ſame: by reaſon wherof the Emperour and kynges maieſtyes, beinge aſſuredly knytte and conſtantly ioyned togyther, intende ioyntly to procede in the warres againſt the ſayde frenche kynge, and neuer to ceaſſe the ſame, vntyll he ſhall be enforced, not onely to deſyſte from the Turke and all his factions, but alſo yelde and render to eyther of them, all ſuche ryghtes thynges and recompences, as to honour reaſon honeſtie and equitie ſhall apperteyne. Wherfore lyke as the kynges maieſtie our ſoueraigne lord hath thought mete, to notifie the premyſſes vnto al and ſingular his moſt louyng and obedient ſubiectes: So his hyghnes by vertue of this his maieſties proclamation, doth declare the ſayde frenche kyng, to be his highnes ennemie, yeuing licence and auctoritie to euery of his ſayde ſubiectes, to vſe the ſayd frenche kyng, and all thoſe whiche depende vpon him, to their mooſte aduauntage and commoditie, as his maieſties ennemies, as hath in ſuche lyke caſe heretofore bene vſed and accuſtomed.
            God ſaue the kynge.
