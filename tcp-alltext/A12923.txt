miſery haue we fallen into, as
wel bodylye as goſtlye? But

beholde Sathan deſyred. &c.
If Peter here by this text had
not the burden laid vpon him
beynge made chiefe of al, then
the queſtion (who was greateſt)
is yet ſtil vnſolued: which
thinge were a great abſurditie
to graunt. Theophilact therfore
ſaieth here vpon (lu. xxii.)

the ſence herof is playne (ſaith

made was but for one alone to
ſignifie that he as head ſhould
haue the chief cure and charge
committed vnto him. And therfore
he bad hym ſtrengthē and
confirme his brethren. Againe
it was not without high miſterie

that Chriſt thus prayed for
him alone, ſeing that in al places
of chriſtēdome which then
in the primatiue church had receiued
the faythe, the ſame is
now decayed both among the
Corinthians, the Galathiās,

Chriſt would him to be ye head

               ¶The ſixt probation.
               All which profeſſe chriſt truly
are membres of Chriſtes eccleſiaſtical
body vnder hym as
head, whether they be prieſtes
or lay men, Emperours kinges,
or byſhoppes (this no mā
denieth I am ſure) but they cā
not be coūted to be vnder chriſt
as their cheif head, which wilfully
do breake the order that
he toke when he was here in
earth, whiche order was that
Peter ſhould be lafte as head
vnder him ouer all hys flocke
(as I haue and ſhall proue it
ſufficiētly in this ſmal boke by
gods mercyful aſſiſtance) whether
they be of ye laitie or of the
clergie. If thou wilt be one of
chriſtes ſhepe whether thou be
kīg or ēperor y• muſt be vnder

his ſhepeherde. It were a mō
                  ſtruous

                     •
                  yghte to ſe the ſhepe
rule the ſhepherd. Nowe yf ye
ſay thautoritie of Emperours,
kynges & princes in chriſtēdō
ought not to be of leſſe mighte
& power thē is the power and
authoritie amonge the heathē
Emprours and kynges which
be free from any ſuche ſubiection.
Hereunto my anſwere is,
that Seruire deo regnare eſt: Seruitus
enim dei ſumma libertas to
ſerue God and to kepe his ordinaunces
is not to be coūted
ſeruyce, but greateſt fredō: it
is no ſubiection, but moſt libertie.
And yet furthermore here
I ſpeake not of a kynge, as a
kynge to be vnder the head of
Chriſtes churche, but a kynge
as a chriſten man, a kynge as

a member of Chriſte, a Kynge
as a ſhepe of Chriſtes folde, ſo
muſte he be vnder and obedient
to Chriſtes ſhepeherd. For
Chriſt made the law generall
in geuynge to Peter full authoritie
to loſe and bynd withoute
any reſtraynt or anye reſpecte
or conſideration had to
kynge or Emperoure: ſo that
none of Chriſtes flocke be exempte
from this hyghe ſhepeherde,
but of neceſſitie compelled
to obeye, onles they wyll
nedes wilfully breake oute of
the folde, and fle from Chriſt.
Herein thys place I myghte
bringe in to ſerue my purpoſe
that noble Emperour Theodoſius,Theo. li. 9. trip. ca. 30.
whiche wyth all humble
obedyence ſubmitted hymſelfe
(lyke a lambe to the ſhepherde)
vnto that holye father

Ambroſe hys Buſhoppe beynge

And oughte not all men

they wil be exempted frō

they be earles, dukes, or princes?

of? would god that at theſe and
many ſuch like examples, laft
in ſtories for oure inſtruction
kinges and princes now a daies
would take occaſion to acknowledge
them ſelues to bee
liuely membres of Chriſtes eccleſiaſticall
body, and with all
humble ſubmiſſiō to iudge thē
                  ſelues
much inferiors as they
be in dede, vnto the chiefe and
ſpiritual head Chriſtes vicare
their principall guide and ſhepherde.
            
            
               ¶The .vii. probacion.
               It is euident that al the Euā
                  geliſtes
(which as it were with
one month do ī al places geue
preeminēce to Peter puttinge
him euer in the fyrſte place)
were at that tyme aſſured

that Peter was heade and
Prince of all the apoſtles. He
was not firſt called as it is writen
in Iohn the fyrſt chapter:
no nor the Euangeliſtes do obſerue
to recite them after their
callyng, but ſometymes one in
this place and contrarywyſe
the ſame in an other place, but
Peter is euer in the firſt place.
Andrew is put ſeconde in Mathewe
.iiii. in Marke and in the
Actes: Iames is fifte in Mathie,
ſecōd in Marke, & third in
Luke: Iohn is the ſixt in Matheu
ſecōd in thactes in Mark
the third, and in Luke the .iiii.
And likewiſe is the chaūginge
in all other, bycauſe they were
all equall: Yea. Luke himſelfe
in his goſpel doeth vary from
that he writeth in thactes: for

there he putteth Andrew ye ſecōd,
but here he coūteth him the
iiii. but Peter in all places bycauſe
chriſt apointed him to be
chief & head is of al named ſtill
the firſt, yea & that not only nū
                  bring
the Apoſtels, but alſo in
al places where Peter with anye
other is recited: as in healinge
the woman that had the
iſſue of bloud. Luke. xii. And in
the ſecōd and alſo .v. of thactes
Peter is euer the firſt.
            
            
               ¶The .vii. probation.
               The ſcriptures truly vnderſtanded
geue euer Peter ye preeminence,
ſo doth the whole cō
                  ſent
of al the holy fathers, & ſo
doeth and euer hath done the
vniuerſall & catholike churche
of Ieſus Chriſt, whyche is the
foundacion and pyller of all

trueth. Who can then ſtry
                     •
                  e againſt
this, and yet thinke him
ſelfe to be a lyuely member in
Chriſtes churche?
            
            
               ¶The .ix. probation.
               Ruling and obeinge (being
coniugata) can neuer bee one
with oute the other. Therfore
Chriſt bidding Peter rule and
gouerne al his flocke (as it is ī
the ſecond probation) euen by
the ſelfe ſame word commaunded
all the flocke to obey him.
So that whether he be highe
or lowe, if he wilbe of Chriſtes
flocke, he muſte nedes obey
                     •
                  
the ſhepherd.
            
            
               ¶The .x. probation.
               
                  
Both Nicen councell and
moſte parte of all the generall
councels euer ſince haue eſtabliſhed
& cōfirmed (as a verity
receiued frō chriſtes time) that
appellations ſhould be made
to ye ſea of Rome:Iulii primi epi. ad antio. yea and that
no coūcels ſhuld be kept without
the conſent of the biſhop of
Rome: and alſo that lyke as
Peter was the chefe and head
of all the Apoſtels, ſo ſhoulde
ye church of Rome in his name
conſecrate by chriſtes appointmente
be head and chiefe ouer
all other churches, whereunto
euen as vnto the mother all other
churches in al matters of
contrauerſie ſhoulde ſeke: all

and ended. Haec Iulius primus.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xi. probation.
               
                  
Chriſt hath but one ſpowſe
(Vna eſt columba mea,
                  cant. 6. 
                  vna eſt

How be it al ye deuels indeuor

(as ye haue herd) that ye

agaīſt this: Peters ſhipe

neuer drowne, though ſometimꝭ
it be ſore toſſed. Chriſt to
Peter alone as to the heade
ſhepeherd gaue charge ouer al
his ſhepe, biddinge him alone
fede & gouerne them: appoyntīg
him not ouer Rome alone
(ſaith Chriſoſtome) but ouer
the whole worlde (which profeſſe
Chriſt) when at his aſſenſcion,Lu. 19.
he goinge into the farre
countrey (mencioned in ye goſpel)
gaue him that large commiſſion.
So that who ſo euer
obeieth not hereunto he is cut

Chriſtes churche then a roten
bowe cut of the tree and caſt a

church and the Latine playnly
do teache. Clement, Anacletus,

Athanaſius, Ambroſe,

not one can agree with the other?
            
            
               ¶The .xii. probacion.
               The cauſe why Chriſt chaū
                  ged
Simons name and called
him Peter was for yt ye he ſhould
be head after him. And here
firſt note yt rede of no chaunging
of names in ſcripture but
for ſome great benefite, priuelege
or high dignity: as appeareth

in Abrahā Iacob and other.
And as for Peters name
it was not geuē with out moſt
high miſtery, and as a ſigne of
greate priuelege. For Peter is
deriued of Chriſtes own name
a petra of the ſtone which was
Chriſt.1. corin. 10. So yt he had his name
moſt like vnto Chriſtes name
euen deriued & taken forthe of
it, not only thereby to ſignifye
vnto vs that Peter ſhold haue
Chriſtes chiefe authoritie and
office cōmitted vnto him, but
alſo bicauſe chriſt did build his
church here upō,Math. 16. when he ſayd
to Peter, vpō this ſtone I wil
builde my churche. What is yt?
S. Hierom, Hilari, & theophe.
vpō Mat. the .xvi. Tertul. alſo
in. li. de preſc. her. And S. Aug.
con. 26. de ſan. do plaīly declare

& ſay y• chriſt gaue to Peter an
exceding great reward for his
cōfeſſiō, in that he ded build his
church vpon him, he being named
the ſtone of ye church to be
builded. Whereby appeareth y•
Peter was ye ſtone where vpō
the church was builded. This
is the cēſure herein of theſe aū
                  cient
fathers and holye ſaintes.
But of thꝭ matter ye haue

               ¶The .xiii. probation.
               There was ſtil one chief head
in ye olde law, which chriſt (as
he ſaithe) came not to breake.Math. 5.
Therfore one muſt nedes cōtinue
ſtil ī ye new. If ye ſay chriſt
is now ye head whereof ye other
was the figure: trueth is chriſt
was and is the head euer: as

Paule ſayth (Chriſtus heri et
hodie. &c) in thold as wel as in
the new:
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . 13. and yet as he had his
vicare vnder him then, ſo muſt
he haue nowe: as Aaron was
then,1. corin. 10. ſo was Peter nowe. All
chaunſed to them in figure.
               Aaron diuerſlye was a figure
of Peter. Aaron offended in
the calfe, Peter in denying his
mayſter: Aarons highe office
was confirmed with the death
of Chore and his company, ſo
was Peters with the death of
Ananye,Num. & Saphire: Aarons

               ¶The .xiiii. probation.
               
                  
In the ſinagoge,Deut. 17. there was
one head biſhop and diuerſe degrees
vnder him: in the church
triumphant Chriſte the heade
with diuers degrees and ordres
of aungels: ſhall then the
churche militaunt be without
a head? In al natural thinges
there is euer one head. In euery
politike and comen wealth
one heade: one kynge in a realme
(as is in the faurthe probation)
one maior in a citye
one ſhiriffe in a ſhire, one head
in euery houſe, and ſhall there
not be one head in the churche
(vpon whom and vpon whoſe
aucthoritie all other muſt depende)
to deſiſe all contrauerſes?
ſhal Chriſtes church be a
monſter either without a head
or els hauinge many heades?

and euery one to do as he wil?
ſhal we graunt this confuſiō?
Shal not thē euery one wraſt
ſcripture after his owne braīe?
but what ſhall we ſay further?
hath not the ſucceſſiō in the ſea
of Rome continued frō the beginninge?li. 3. ca. 3. &. 4
doeth not Ireneus
declare this? doth not S. Aug.

               If Chriſt had lafte Thappoſtels
without a head (yea or
if ſīce we could haue bene without
one) then muſt nedes haue
chaunſed that which is ſpoken
the laſt chapter of the boke of
Iudges, yt in thoſe daies there

body with manye heades.
For then throughe variaunce,
ſciſme & contention he euer ſoweth

So that ther is no more open
waye to let in all hereſies then
to take awaye Peters primacye
and authorytye frome the

of the church neuer go aboute
to extincte other hereſies tyll
this great wound be healed, &
we clerely reſtored to the vnitye

               ¶The .xvi. probation.
               Aaron was a figure of Peter
like as Moyſes was of
Chriſte.Anacletꝰ he
                        •
                      habet. And as Aaron was
vnder Moyſes ſo Peter was
vnder Chriſt al being prieſtes
(Moiſes et Aaron in ſacerdotibꝰ
eius.) And as Moiſes wt God
and Aaron with ye people hādled
all matters, god ſayinge to
Moyſes,Exod. 4. Aaron ſhall be thy
mouth to the people and thou
his to me, euen ſo Chriſt was

Peters mouth to god whē he
ſaid I haue prayed for the. &c.
               And Peter was Chriſtes
mouthe to the people, when
Chriſte ſayde to him confirme
thou and ſtrengthen thy brethren.
And here obſerue this
(ſayth S. Aug. vpō ye ſaid text
lu. 20.) yt Chriſte neither prayd
for Iames nor Iohn, but only
for Peter, in whom al the other
were cōteined he beinge ye
head of the familie. And therfore
in paying the tribute money
(wherof is ſpokē in the .iii.
probation) which was but one
pece named drachma in value
a payſe grote payd onelye for
the head of euery houſe: Chriſt
cauſed Peter to gyue .ii. peces
in ſygne and token (ſayeth he)
that Chriſt then was ye heade

of the houſe, & that Peter was
after to be ī his ſtede to ſupply
his rowm. wherfore as al then

               ¶The .xvii. probation.
               Many priueleges which S.
Peter had aboue other geuen
hī by Chriſt plainly declare hꝭ
primacy: one is, he gaue Peter
power to loſe & bind ī ye heuēs
& to other but ī one heuē: which
thing plainelye decareth ſayth
Origen (a man of no ſmall authoritie)

vpō yt ſame place Peters
preeminence aboue al the
reſt. An other priuelege is that
thāgel after chriſtes reſurrection
onlinamed peter, ſaying go
tel to the diſciples, and to Peter
whiche was not (as ſome
ſaye) onlye to comforte him,
leſt he ſhoulde haue diſpaired,
ſeinge Chriſtes firſt appering
to him, was ſufficient comfort
for him, but it was (as auncient
writers doo teſtifye) to
ſhew his primacy▪ like as that
was to ſe how al the .iiii. euangeliſtes
ſo exactly do ſet forthe
his .iii. denials. An other priuelege
is that Peter thoughe he
came to the Sepulchre after
S. Iohn yet he went fyrſte
into it: he went fyrſte to Chriſtes
place, whyche after hym

ſhuld be firſt & chief ī ye church.
It was alſo a great

laſt of al chriſt ſaid only to Peter,
folowe me: by which wordes
(ſayth Chriſoſtō) he ſhewed
agayne both his great loue
and charge that Peters cure
ſhould be greater then all the
reſt. Here now then I will demaunde
certayne queſtions, if
Peter ſhould not haue bene ye
chiefe of all, and that euen by
Chriſtes will, why then didde
Chriſte onelye geue to him a
name deriued forth of hꝭ own
name? Why was he
                     •
                   named
firſt in al places? Why was the
churche promiſſed to be buylded
vppon him? Why gaue
Chriſt onely to hym the keyes
of the heauens? Why ioyned
he onelye Peter with him in

paying the tribute? Why prayed
he onely for Peter, committinge
the charge of his brethren
to him? Why did he fyrſte
appeare to Peter alone? Why
did he byd Peter folow him in
kinde of de
                     •
                  th? And why was
onely Peter crucified as chriſt
was? Why had he al theſe priueleges?
Euen bicavſe he was
head of all. And this is the
cenſure and iudgemente of all
the whole churche of Chriſte
and of all the holy Saynctes,
Martirs, and Confeſſoors, euen
ſince chriſtes time hitherto.

and declare euidently yt
he had the keies only, yt he had

there ſpokē by chriſt to him (as
by priuelege) only: & this cauſed
hī euer ſtill to take vpon hī

truſt in Ieſus Chriſt that the

to the fayth and doctrine

                  ¶Here now the councel of Alexandrine
(wherein ye Arians
were condemned) here I ſaye
all ye biſhops of Egipt, Thebeans,
& Libians, among whom
holy Athanaſius was, they
writing to Felix then biſhop
of Rome. Here I
ſay how they ded expound
the former
text.
                  All thoſe holye fathers did
there playnlye declare that it
was decreed in Nicē counſel yt
mē ſhould appeale in certayne
caſes to the ſee apoſtolike, ye ſee
of Rome, to whome Chriſts
gaue by ſpeciall prerogatiue
aboue all other power to loſe

guide and henge in whom all

muſt be ſuſteined, vpholden &
mayntayned, he ſayinge, thou
art Peter, and vpon thy foundaciō
the pillers of the church,
that is to ſaye, the biſhoppes
(whoſe office is to ſuſteyne the
church) are builded and confirmed
vnto thee, the prince, the
teacher, & the head of all chriſtian
religion the keyes were geuen
and power in heauen and
earthe. &c.
                  Oh howe great then is this
authorytye where vnto wyth
one conſente whole chriſtendome
thus doeth agree? Yea
and that not all beinge ſtil gathered
together in one place,
but being ofte ſeperated farre
a ſūder not one knowing of an

faſhion expounding the forſaid

one hereby geuinge to Peter
and his ſucceſſours, the hyghe
preeminence and authority aboue
al chriſtendom. So that
by the conſent of al theſe (both
fathers and counſels) it well
appeareth that Peter aunſwered
onely for him ſelfe, like as
didde the ſcribe marke the .ix.
where as chriſt demaunded a

Sometimes when he demaū
                     ded

when he aſked whom do men
ſaye the ſonne of man is?
                  Sometimes whē he aſked all,Math. 16.
none aunſwered, but euerye
one held his peace: as when he

asked, wherof they reaſoned in
the waye? And ſome tymes
one alone aunſwered,Mar. 
                           •
                        . as did
Peter in the former texte, and
the ſcribe marke the .ix. And
here now I iudge, this obiection
is ſufficiently anſwered vnto,
to ſatiſfye herewith al reaſonable
people: and as for the other
ſorte, God I beſeche him
open theyr eies to ſe the truth,
or els take them awaye quicklye
for feare of infectinge the
flocke of Chriſte and ſpeciallye
the ſimple Lambes of his
folde.
               
            
            
               ¶The .ii. obiection.
               Saynete Auguſtine in ſundry
places (as. 50. tract. in euan.
Ioa) ſemeth to ſaye that chriſte

builded the churche vpon Peters
faith, or vpon his cōfeſſiō,
yea or vpon chriſt him ſelfe. &c.
               
                  ¶Thanſwere.
                  This is fully anſwered vnto
in the laſte reſponſion: but yet
ſomewhat to ſaye further: S.
Aug ofte vſeth in treatinge of
matters to diſpute and reaſon
ſundry wayes: ſo to trye forth
the truthe. But ye muſt marke
that it is not alone to teache a
ſure and true doctrine, and to
diſpute to reaſon or ſerch forth
a verity or doctrine. S. Aug. in
his ſermons wherin he taught
the truethe to the people euer
ſhewed playnlye that Chriſte
buylded his churche vpon Peter
accordinge to the fayth of

the church not mathamaticallye
vpon Peters faith but vpon
faythfull Peter. So that a
catholike fayth is neceſſarilye
required to euerye membre of
Chriſtes church. And thus it
is to be taken that authors oft
do aſcribe it to Peters fayth.
                  For els bothe Nathaniel and
they alſo, which in the tempeſt
that Chriſte ſwaged with his
woorde, made like confeſſion
with Peter and before him,
ought to haue had ye ſame bleſſynge
that Peter had.
               
            
            
               ¶The thyrd obiection.
               The gates of hell ſhall
not preuayle agaynſte the
foundations of the church: but
manye biſhops of Rome haue

bene heretikes, yea and many
other haue bene ſinful in their
liuinge & very wicked, againſt
whom the gates of hell haue
preuayled. Wherfore ye church
is not founded vpon them.
               
                  Thanſwer.
                  If they be wicked they ſhall
not eſcape the hande of God
(Potentes potenter tormenta patienter)
but wicked or not wicked
al we are bound to obeye.Sapi. 6.
The Scribes and Pharaſies
(ſayth Chriſt) ſate vpon Moyſes
ſeate,Math. 23. obei & obſerue al that
they bid. The ſinne of ye ruler
is no derogacion to the power
and authoritie god hath putte
him in, yea and none is pure
wtout al ſinne, neither one nor
other, head nor foote, no nor ye
                     
churche it ſelfe here (whyche is
the congregacion of faitheful
people) is al wholly pure without
ſpot or wrincle: but ye churche
triumphāt in heauē (ephe.
the .v.) ſhalbe al pure holy and
immaculate withoute ſpot or
wrinckle. Peter him ſelfe the
head & foundacion of ye church
after the keyes receiued was
called ſathan, yea and after denyed
his Maiſter thriſe. Wherfore
againſt ye catholyke churche
builded vpō Peter the gates
of hel ſhall neuer preuaile:
that is to ſaye, the faithe ſhal
neuer faile neither in the catholyke
churche nor in the head of
it, neither in Peter nor in his
ſucceſſours: but there the faith
ſhall euer abyde ſounde and
perfecte. The gates of hel

haue preuayled (I graunte)
againſt the perſons of the Popes,
but not againſt the power
&c. The gates of hel ſhall not
preuaile againſte it: that is to
ſay, neither infidelitye nor hereſye.
                  For lyke as ye perfection or integretye
of faithe is the porte
or gate throughe whyche we
enter or goe in to the way that
leadeth to yt kingdome of heauens,
ſo is infidelitie or hereſie
the gate throughe whyche the
enteres go ſtreighte to hel fire.
Now as for that they ſaye the
faith of Peter in manye of his
ſucceſſours hathe fayled, as in
Marcellinus, Liberius, Felix
the ſeconde, Anaſtaſius the ſeconde,
Iohannes the .xxii. Benedictus

the .xi. and Honorius
wyth other, whyche (ſaye
they) dyd erre and their faithe
did faile.
                  And therefore the prayer of
Chriſte is not ſo to bee taken,
that he dyd meane the perſon
of Peter and his ſucceſſours
when he prayde that Peters
faithe ſhoulde not fayle, but he
dyd meane that it ſhoulde not
decay or fayle (ſaye they) in his
whole congregatiō or church:
but that one or other (thoughe
he were not openlye knowen)
ſhould euer kepe the true faith
Here vnto I aunſwere that
Albertus Pighius defēdeth
all theſe Byſhops of Rome
wyth diuerſe other from al errours
& hereſies in the fourthe

boke and viii. Chapiter of his
Hierarchie: ſo that their faithe
(ſaith he) did neuer decaye, no
nor the faithe of any that euer
was or ſhalbe in the place ſet
in Peters cheare. Neuertheles
it is no inconuenyence to
graūt yt ſome of the Popes for
a time haue erred,Errātes rom. pontifices ſe dis authoritas cito correxit, vel eos penitus reiecerit &c. haec platina. but quickelye
by the authoritie of the ſee
and the holy ghoſte the matter
hath bene refourmed againe,
ſo that the faith hath not bene
counted there to faile, no more
then yu righteous man fallinge
vii. times in the day is counted
to loſe ye name of a righteous
man. Furthermore, like as the
vniuerſal church in diſcuſſinge
matters of oure faithe can not
erre (and yet all men as men
may erre) bycauſe of Chriſtes

aſſiſtaunce continuallie gouerning
the ſame, euē ſo Chriſtes
vicar ye pope as a priuate perſon
& as infirme man may erre
both in lyuinge and beleuinge
(and then neither heade nor
member of Chriſtes churche
beinge cut of) but as pope and
head he can not decide nor determine
anye thinge amiſſe.
Marcellinus did amiſſe in ſacrifiſing
to Idoles, yea Saint
Peter offended Galathas the
ſecōde, but neither of them erred
in diſcuſſinge matters of
faith & that through Chriſtes
aſſiſtaunce and his holy ſpirit.
And ſo theuangeliſtes as men
mighte and did offende and
erre but as writers of ſcripture
they coulde not ſo doe.
                  
                     
But here nowe to ſpeake more
of that they ſclaunderouſlye
obiecte, ſayinge, that manye
Popes haue bene nought and
ſinful in lyuinge. What is that
to the purpoſe? the authoritye
remaineth yet ſtil perfite. How
manye of the Kinges euen of
Iuda were moſt wycked? was
their authoritye anye thinge
diminiſhed thereby? No truly.
Ofre for the ſynne of the people
God ſuffereth the wycked
the tirāde or hypocryte to rule:Iob. 34.
beſide mani other plages whiche
he daylye powreth vpon
theym for ſynne: and euen the
ſame he ofte ſendeth in to hys
churche, and yet thauthorytye
is euer to be obeyed. As they
whyche ſat in Moyſes chere,
euen ſo now they whyche ſitte

in Peters ſeate. So though yt
they be euel & nought, thauthoritye
yet ſtill continueth. And
here now forthermore, though
for a time they know not who
is ryght Pope through ye doutes
that may be in elections, or
that for the tyme there be a
Schiſme and then two or thre
named Popes ſedicyouſlye,
whereof in dede none is ryght
Pope, as it appeareth in the
counſel of Conſtancienſe, and
alſo in the time of Henry the ii.
Emperoure, where Benedicte
the ninth, Silueſter the third,
and Gregorie the ſixte, dyd al
contende at one time, and yet
none of the three beynge the
ryghte Pope, nor anye other
then electe (for Clemente

the ſecōde was after lawfully
choſen and they iii. depoſed) yet
ſtil euer remained ye ſee whole,
and thautority firme and ſure:
Chriſtes cote was neuer cutte
nor deuyded. Agayne, we ſee
that through ambiciō of Emperours
Kinges Princes & other
inferior magiſtrates, whiche
ofte cauſe their bloude and
kinred to be choſen and ſet in
higheſt dignities in the church
beinge moſte vnmete there to,
greate ſclaunder and ſore decaye
commeth to the true religion
of Chriſte. We ſee moreouer
yt wycked lyuers ofte falle
into errours and hereſies, and
then lyue more licētiouſlye after
thexample of Paulus ſamoſatenus
whereof Euſebiusli. 7. ec. ca. 26
                     
ſpeaketh. We ſee alſo that God
ofte for the ſynne of his people
ſendeth (as I euen now ſayd)
wycked rulers bothe ſpiritual
and temporal, and ſo greuouſlye
plageth them by that meanes:
as ye bothe rede in Iob &
in Eſaye.Iob. 34. But what maketh
this agaynſt the Popes authoritye?Eſa. 43.
Forſothe nothinge at al.
Howbeit here by we maye be
put in remembraunce ſtyl to
crye vnto GOD to ſende holy
Fathers of the cleregye to bee
ſet in dignities to rule ouer vs.
Which thing I ſuppoſe would
be muche better then ofte it is,
yf temporall Magiſtrates
woulde lette elections of the
Cleregye alone, and that all
myghte be done by callynge of

tholye Ghoſte, wythout ſimonye,
without auarice, without
ambicion, & without deſyre of
pompe in the worlde. But I
wyl not medel with this matter:
it ferre paſſeth my reache.
I wyl onelye ſay with the holy
man Chriſoſtome, O yea men
of the laitie, reioyce not, laugh
not, yf ye ſe wycked and vnmete
miniſters of the Clergye
crepte in to the Churche, but
wepe and wayle, and thinke
that it is for your ſinne: thinke
that if they be braſſe (ſaithe he)
then be ye Irne: yf they be
Irne, ye be earthe. For ye be
euer worſe then they. If the
ſalte of the earth be vnſauery,
where with all ſhal anye thing
be well ſeaſoned? If the lyght
be gone, yf the candel be oute,

howe ſhall ye ſe then in darkenes?
Lorde be mercyful vnto
vs. The ſpiritual miniſters of
god from the higheſt to the loweſt
ſhould be choſen and takē
of the pureſt, of ye moſt godlye,
and of the beſt learned. But
alaſſe of late yeres here in this
Realme of England, the moſt
vnmete, the mooſte vyle and
naughteſt were made bothe
Preſtes and Byſhoppes.
                  Oh what greate plage was yt
to the ſimple ſoules, and innocent
people? (I remember the
like choſynge .iiii. regum .xvii.iii.
regum .xiii. et. li. i. eccle. cap. v
et .xii.) but thākes be to Ieſus
Chriſte ſuche be taken away,
they be well weded fourthe of
the churche, and both godlye &
learned placed in their romes.

But nowe to retourne to my
proceſſe intended.
               
            
            
               ¶The .iiii. obiection.
               Chriſt called Peter checkinglye
ſathan: ſtreight after that
bleſſing and high preeminence
geuen to him. Wherefore it
ſhould appeare that Chriſtes
wordes in that bleſſinge were
only to be referred to ye church
and not to Peters perſon.
               
                  The anſwere.
                  Peters fallynge toke not
away his power geuen to him
before: Chriſtes chekinge him
doth not fruſtrate his bleſſing,
nor take away the ſtrenght of
Chriſtes wordes pronounced
in bleſſing him: whych bleſſing
was geuē for the time to come
and not for the time preſent.

For al the time til thappoſtels
had receiued tholy ghoſte they
were but infirme and feareful
they were vnperfite before the
paſſion ſaith Origen & Hilari.ho. 3. in. mat.
Wherfore if ye aſke how could
he, whyche had opened to him
the highe miſterye of Chriſte
whereby he cōfeſſed him to be
the ſonne of God, now be ignoraunt
of his death and paſſiō?Chriſo. ho. 15. in. math.
the anſwere is, that Peter had
the highe miſterye of Chriſt opened
vnto him that he was ye
ſonne of GOD: but as for the
miſterye of the paſſion it was
hid frō him. Therefore it was
no maruel that he was ignoraunte
of it. Agayne Origen
ſaith that the rebuke or checke
then geuen to Peter callynge
him ſathan (whyche is but aduerſarye)

was but gentel: lyke
a rebuke of the father geuē to
the childe. For Chriſte (ſaithe
he) tourned to him when he
rebuked him: But bleſſed is he
to whome Chriſte doth turne.
He turned to Peter, and that
moſte mercifullye, after that
Peter had denyed him thriſe.
Yea and moreouer Chriſt bad
him here come after hī: whiche
is euer to be taken in the good
parte. Lyke as contrarywiſe,
it is euel and wicked, to go after
youre owne luſt or concupiſcence
(Poſt concupiſcentias
tuas neeas) accordynge to Helias
ſaynge,Eccle. 18. do ye yet halte in
two partes?3. Reg. 18. yf God be he, go
after him, & yf Baal be he, go
after Baal. Finallye, ſome doe
holde, that Chriſte rebuked

not Peter heare, but the euel
ſpirite whiche cauſed him ſo to
ſaye to Chriſte.
               
            
            
               ¶The .v. obiection.
               Some thinges be ſpoken
(ſaithe Sainte Aug.) whyche
are thought properlye to perteine
to Peter,In pſa. 108. & yet they haue
not their chief vnderſtandinge
except they be referred vnto ye
churche, whoſe perſon Peter
was wel knowen to beare in
figure, for ye preeminēce which
he had ouer thother Apoſtels.
As that is, I geue to thee the
keyes of the kingdome of heauens,
with ſuche other.
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  Be it ſo, yt that is true, yt Peter

bare a figure of the church,
and that Chriſtes wordes to
him I wil geue thee the keyes
&c. haue a more highe vnderſtanding
being referred to the
church then if they be referred
to Peters perſon, bycauſe of
the vnitye, the primacie, & prerogatiue
of the church, whych
was begone and inſtitute in
Peter, the geuing of the keies,
and the highe power to loſe &
binde, was not to bee referred
to the onlye perſon of Peter &
there to ende, but to continue
in the churche ſtil by ſucceſſion
yet all this is but referred to
the churche by the meanes of
Peter and through Peter, and
ſo ſhall contynue by ſucceſſion
whiles chriſtēdome endureth.
For whē chriſt ſayd to hī alone

thou art Peter. &c. he made of
hym the beginning of ye church
ſaying I will build my church
vpon the or vpon this ſtone. &c
               
            
            
               The .vi. obiection.
               Chriſte is the foundacion &
heade of the church, how ſhuld
then Peter be the foundacion
or head therof?
               
                  Thanſwere.
                  Chriſt is the chiefe foundacion
whiche by his owne vertue
power and ſtrength vpholdeth
all the building, he is alſo
the chiefe heade from whence
the ſpiritual and liuelye influence
doth deſcende and flowe
into al the members: but therfore
ye can not conclude that
the church hath two foundacions
or .ii. heades, and ſo to be
as monſtruous: ſeing ye Peter

receyued but only of Chriſt to
be the head & the foundacion
after him.Ioa. 8. As chriſt the light:Math. 5.
and the appoſtels the light.Ioa. 10.
Chriſt the ſhepeherd,Ephe. 4. and thappoſtels
the ſhepeherdes.
               
            
            
               ¶The .vii. obiection.
               There is muche a do about
chaunging Simons name in
to peter, as though that made
any thinge for it: ſeing Iames
and Iohn hadde theyr names
chaūged, and were called Bonarges
the ſonnes of thonder.
               
                  ¶Thanſwere.
                  Iohn and Iames had not
theyr names chaunged, but
had a comen name added vnto
them: which neuer is ſpoken
of, but only when it was geuē
in Marke the thirde chapiter:

and yet this their comen name
was not added withoute a
great prerogatiue for yt onelye
Iohn and Iames were admitted
with Peter to be at the trāſfiguracion,Mat. 17.
and at the rayſing
of the ruler of the Sinagoges
doughter,Mar. 3. & alſo at his prayer
in the garden before his death.
Howbeit Peter had his name
chaunged,Ioa. 18. and had a name geuen
which was deriued out of
chriſtes owne name (which is
petra, a ſtone) ſo that chriſt did
communicate his owne name
to Peter, ſignifyinge that he
ſhould kepe his owne place after
him, and be the ſtone the
foundacion of his church. But
of this chaunginge of Peters
name is more largelye ſpoken
in the .xii. probation.
               
            
            
               
               The .viii. obiection.
               Al the apoſtels receyued immediatly
of Chriſt like & equal
dignity power and authoritye
euen ouer thuniuerſal churche
of chriſt, he ſaying to al and to
euery one indifferently, as my
father ſend me I ſend you, receyue
al 
                     •
                  holy ghoſt, go into al
places of the world & preache,
baptiſe, heale diſeaſes, and forgiue
ſinnes.
               
                  Thanſwere.
                  Not onlye thappoſtels but
alſo .72. diſciples receyued all
theſe of Chriſt, in ſo much that
ye people of Samaria through
Phillp the deacons preaching
receyued the ghoſpel and were
baptiſed: then was rather the
tyme to congregate and gether

together with all ſpede
the flocke of Chriſte, then to
make any mention of rulinge
or gouerninge them. Notwithſtanding
before all theſe commiſſions,
Peter was made
head ouer all: Math. the .xvi.
as is declared in the anſweres
to the firſt and tenth obiectiōs
& in ſundrye places mo of this
booke.In epiſt. ad ephe. Wherfore Saynct Ambroſe
ſayth that at the beginninge
all taught and baptiſed
at all times and in all places
(not only in churches) as occaſion
ſerued: but as ſone as the
people were ſomewhat gathered
together in the fayth, and
churches builded, then were
ordres ſette and rulers appointed
by tholy ghoſt, ſome in this
place and ſome in that, euen

as chriſt promiſed. So that
this now iuſtlye weyed, what
maketh this obiection againſt
Peters authoritie which was
geuen to him before by Chriſt?
Surelye no more then now it
ſhould be agaynſt the legates
prerogatiue if Peters ſucceſſour
the Pope woulde for vrgēt
cauſes conſtitute certayne
inferiour Biſhops to be legates
equall with him, geuinge
them all and to euerye one of
them his owne full authoritye
ſome into Germany, ſome into
Denmarke. &c. Yea and beſide
this, who doth not ſe yt though
legates haue the Popes full
authoritie geuen them, yet in
the foundation of the authoritye
all is not equall: no more

then Chriſte geuinge to all the
appoſtelles and to the .27. diſciples
alſo, his owne whole and
full authoritye that he had of
his father, was in the roote &
foundacion to be counted all
equall power and authoritye
with that whiche he him ſelfe
had of his heauenly father. Agayne
what Idiote will iudge
the .27. Diſciples to be equall
with thappoſtels thoughe in
that legacy and imbaſſage concerninge
preaching and baptiſinge
they were appoynted by
Chriſt as all equall? And euen
now here the ſame is to be ſaid
to that in this imbaſſage or legacye
Chriſte for the time ſend
all forthe wyth that equall
commyſſyon to gether the

people, not then ſpeakynge of
anye gonerninge of theym: in
whiche gouerninge (when it
ſhoulde ones be put in execution)
Peter was ordeyned euē
by Chriſt to be the head, Mathue
the .xvi. So that all this
theyr commiſſion and aucthoritye
was but taken forthe of
Peters.
               
            
            
               ¶The ninthe obiection.
               Anacletus and alſo Ciprian
do ſaye that all the apoſtles
had equall power and
dignitye geuen to theym by
Chriſt:In ſimp. 
                        •
                     le. but bycauſe all ſhould
preache one thinge: therfore
the beginning thereof firſt began
by one, which was Peter.

Yea and he ſayeth further,Anacle. ait caeteri apoſtoli cum beato petro pari corſortio p̄
                     diti & honorem et poteſtatem acceperunt. Cip. ait, ꝙ hoc caeteri apoſtoli erant ꝙ petrus fuit, pari conſortio prediti & honoris & poteſtatis. in
the church there is one office of
all buſhoppes, wherof euerye
one hath a part allotted whollye
vnto him.Reſpon̄. Id eſt in ſimil. honoris & poteſtatis. Rurſus: duplex eſt poteſtas, vna, ordinis ſiue conſecrationis, altera, regiminis ſiue adminiſtrationis. Anacle. & cipri. fatentur omnes eſſe pares ſi loquaris de poteſtate ordinis vel conſecrationis, ſed non eſſe pares in regimine, in adminiſtratione, ac iuriſdictione.
               
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  This is ſomwhat anſwered
vnto in the laſt reſponſion. Neuertheles
to ſpeake a lytle further
therin,con. 27. de ſanctis. S. Aug. ſaith that
S. Peter and S. Paule were

equall: but he doth not leue it
ſo raw, but declareth how, ſayinge,
they were equall in merite,
but in power and authorytye
Peter didde farre excell,
like as Paule did in ſcience.
Howbeit in power to forgyue
ſinnes, in power to preache, in
power to miniſter the Sacramentes,
in excommunicatinge
&c. all were lyke, and all theyr
power was like not onelye amonge
thappoſtels, but alſo if
ye ioyne the .72. diſciples wyth
them (as is declared in the laſt
reſponſion) ſo that herein doth
not conſiſt Peters authoritye
aboue others but it doth cōſiſt
in the iuriſdiction aboue all other.
So that thoughe in
ſome thinges all the apoſtels

had equall power and dignitie
geuen vnto thyem by Chriſte,
yet bycauſe they ſhoulde all
preache one thynge, Chriſte
woulde one (that is to ſay Peter)
to be the begynner, the
chiefe and heade of al:Super vnum edificat eccleſi. quamuis omnibus apoſtolis parem dederat poteſtatē (in ſacramento videlicet & poteſtate ordinis ſacer dotalis) vt vnitatem manifeſtaret. vnitatis ita
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         ciuſdem originem ab vno incipientem authoritate ſua diſpoſuit: & exordium ab vnitate proficiſcitur vt eccleſia vna eſſe monſiretur que eſt vna ſemper ordinata hominum multitudo in diuinum cultum. bycauſe
the vnytie of the church ſhould
depende vpon the vnitie of Peters
authoritie. As concerning
thoffice of apoſtelſhip or edifyinge
in fayth, ſo they were equal,
but in gouernement and
power Peter heade of all the
reſt.
                  
                     
And where you ſaye there is
one office of all biſhops wherof.
&c. S. Ciprians wordes be
theſe. Eccleſia vna eſt. &c. epiſcopatus
vnus eſt cuius a ſingulis
in ſolidū pars tenetur, id eſt. The
church is one, the biſhopriche
is one, wherof parte is holden
of euerye one as in the whole.
This is the engliſhe of it (and
not as ye for youre purpoſe
haue tranſlated it) wherby appeareth
nothinge els but that
al dependeth vpon the vnitye.
&c. If this were not here S.
Ciprians meaninge, why then
in other places did S. Ciprian
ſay (as we haue it in the .74
probacion and iu aunſwering
to the firſt obiection) that vpō
Peter Chriſte builded his
church as vpon the firſt in dignity?

And that the ſee of Rome
is the roote and mother of all
churches? And agayne yt al he
reſies and ſchiſmes do ſpringe
only of that men will not obey
the head biſhop? I ſet Ciprian
to anſwer to Ciprian. Thinke
not yt the holy Martir will be
cōtrary to him ſelfe.
               
            
            
               ¶The .x. obiection.
               The keyes were equallye
geuen to al (though he promiſed
them but to Peter alone)
when Chriſte brethed vppon
them and ſayd receyue the holy
ghoſt,math. 16. whoſe ſinnes ye forgiue
they be forgiuen.Ioa. 20. &c.
               
                  ¶The aunſwere.
                  The keyes were geuen to
the churche, but in the perſon
of Peter bicauſe of the vnitye.
And here firſt note that there

is no mention made of the keyes
but onlye Mathue the .xvi.
where as only to Peter Chriſt
promiſed them: but his promiſſe
and his ſaying is his doing.
So that although to forgeue
ſinnes, which was geuen
to all the apoſtels and .72. diſciples
alſo (as is declared in the
laſte anſwere but one) do perteyne
to the keyes as a parte
therof: yet is there in the keyes
a muche more large power
conteyned. For therein is comprehended
the fulneſſe of all eccleſiaſticall
power and dignitye:
whiche euen then in the
xvi. of Mathue Chriſte gaue
onlye to Peter (ſayinge tibi to
thee) and through hym to all
his ſucceſſours. He promiſſed

theym onelye to him but his
promiſſinge or his ſayinge (as
I ſaide) was his doinge (Eius
dixiſſe eſt feciſſe) & that it is ſo,
by goddes helpe I ſhall nowe
trye by ſufficient teſtimonye.
But firſt note that when chriſt
had ſpoken of the churche and
that the gates of hell ſhoulde
not preuayle agaynſte it, he
no further continued hys promiſſe
to the church but turned
then his ſpeache to Peter, ſayinge
I wil giue to thee the keyes:
ſo that the churche receyueth
them throughe Peter, to
whom in his own perſon then
they were geuen as to the
heade and foundacion of the
churche vnder Chriſte.
                  
                     
But now let vs heare teſtimonies
hereof.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              ¶Tertulian libro de
preſt. haer.
                              Was there anye thinge hid
from peter (as ye haue it twiſe
before) whiche was called
the ſtone of the foundacion of
the church? Which had the keyes
of heauens geuen him and
power to loſe and binde both
in heauens and in earthes?
Tertulian here ſpeaketh of
that Chriſt ſayde to Peter after
he had geuen him the bleſſynge
Mathue the .xvi. that

and to forgeue ſinne, was geuen
after the reſurreccion both
to the Apoſtels and to the .27.
Diſciples (as a parte of the

who I praye you is ſo foonde

                  ¶The anſwere.
                  That power geuen Math

the wicked, and to loſe thē
from it againe if they were trulye

And here note wel, that it was
not without great cauſe, that
Chriſte vſed here the plurel

Peter the heade excepte) but it
was geuen to the churche and

any one may excōmunicate,
onely Peter (for him and hys

with the keyes: and therefore
he alone put it in executiō vpō
Anani,Act. 5. &. 8. vpon Saphire, & vpō
Simō Magus. &c. How be it
if a man ſhould graunt, that ye
power of loſing and bindinge
(Mat. xviii) was ſpokē to the
apoſtels as before (Mat. xvi)
to Peter, yet muſt we nedes
confeſſe (as appeareth in the
anſwers to ye .iii. laſt obiectiōs)

that to Peter as to yE head the
power was geuen, & to other
but as vnder him, ſtil kepinge
& obſeruing a due order, which
order is broken, if Peter, the
other Apoſtels, and the .72. diſciples

               ¶The .xii. obiection.
               The .viii. of thactes Peter and
Iohn were ſent by thother apoſtels
to Samaria, but ye ſenders
ſeme to be greater then
they whiche be ſent. &c.
               
                  ¶The anwere.
                  When by Philip the dracon
the people of Samaria were
cōuerted to ye faith, by ye cōſēt of
all ye apoſtles (the holye ghoſte
being ye chief author) Peter as
whoſe authoritie was greateſt

was choſen as beinge thought
moſte mete to goe to confirme
them with tholye ſpyrite, the
matter and caſe then requirynge
the chiefe power. What
did this againſte Peters authoritye?
or to the derogation
of his high power and preeminece?
It ſemeth rather to ſette
fourth his excellent priuelege:
bycauſe none was thoughte
(yea euē to the holy goſt which
was the chiefe ſender) ſo mete
as Peter he being the head of
al to goe to deſtroye the great
member of the deuil Simon
Magus: a thinge of paſſinge
difficultie which required Peters
preſēce. This was an argument
of tharians, the father
ſent the ſonne, ergo the ſonne
was leſſe then the father. How

be it Herode ſent ye .iii. Kinges
to Chriſt, yet he was not greater
then they. May not ye King
and the Counſel of a Realme
finde a cauſe that ſhal ſeme expediēt
yt the Kinge in his owne
perſon ſhall goe? Wil they not
then ſay, it hath pleaſed yt King
& the Councel, ye the King him
ſelfe ſhal goe, & take one chiefe
Duke with him, as Peter had
Iohn wt him? May it not then
be ſayd, the cauſe was ſo great
they haue euē ſende fourth the
King? haue not euen the verye
conſuls of Rome (as hiſtories
declare) ofte ſo bene ſente? was
not therfore the conſuls authoritye
the higheſte, but to be
counted equal with other? yea
haue we not a lyke example in
ſcripture,Ioſ. 2
                           •
                        . how the head of al

Phinees was ſēt & .x. Princes
with him in to the land of Galaad?
euē ſo Peter the head as
moſte mete and as moſt honorable
was put therunto being
ſo ſent to Samaria: yea & note
this that Peter euer vſed humble
ſubmiſſion but where authoritie
was required. But further
yet herein to ſpeake what
derogation were it now to the
Popes authoritie, if the whole
college of Cardinalles did conclude
that it were expediēt for
his fatherhode now to come in
to Englande? Moreouer, note
wel (concerning this obiectiō)
that in thactes Lukes chiefe
purpoſe was to deſcribe ye pere
grinatiō of him ſelf & of Paule
ſo y• not one worde is there of
Peters tarieng nor of his ſtallaciō
                     
at Antioche, nor of ye deuidīg
thapoſtels into ſūdry cū

nor whō they cōuerted nor
what martirdōe they ſuffered.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xiii. obiection.
               In ye xv. of thactes in ye queſtiō
had about the legals Iames
had ye chefe preeminēce for the
coūcel was cōcluded by hī. &c.
               
                  The aunſwere.
                  S. Peter made S. Iames
Buſhop of Ieruſalē,In epiſto. ad epiſco. per Itaiian. as Anacletus
Peters diſciple & ſucceſſour
ſaith:ho. 87. in io
                           •
                        
                      & after him Chriſoſtome
cōfirmeth ye ſame, with
theſe wordes, Peter ye Maſter
of ye whole world made Saint
Iames Buſhope of Ieruſalē.
Do ye thinke then, that Saint
Iames would take vpō him to
be aboue his head? but now I
pray you iuſtlye pouder & wey

the place Actes the .xv. and ye
ſhal fynde that both Peter did
firſt as head ſay his mind (yea
though it were in. S. Iames
ſee) and alſo that which Peter
then ſaid toke place ſhortly after
& yet doth, S. Iames euen
then confirminge Peters ſayinge
with the prophetes teſtimony.
What maketh it then againſt
Peters authoritie that
S. Iames approuing all that
Peter had ſpoken added ſomthīg
to Peters wordes? which
addicion yet ſhortly after was
quite taken awaye and neuer
ſince obſerued, that is to ſaye,
to abſtene from bloud. &c. yea
& may not ye chiefe of a councel
firſt geue his ſētence (as Peter
did here) & yet after him an inferior
may ſay ſomething more,

whyche ſhalbe thought to the
whole coūſel better for ye time?
doeth this any thing againſte
thautoritie of the chiefeſt? Peters
iudgemēt was yt the heathen
people ſhould be quite deliuered
frō al the Iewiſhe burdens:
& ſo ſhortlye after it was
fullye concluded (though for a
ſhorte time S. Iames counſel
was taken) as appeareth by yt
Paule then ſone afterwrote to
the Corinthians:1. cor. 10. bye al that cō
                     meth
into ye ſhambles, eate all
thinges.Tit. 1. &c. & to Tite, all meates
be cleane vnto the pure, &
to the Romās,Rom. 14. no meate is to
be coūted cōmen or vncleane,
ye whyche eate not, miſiudge
not them that eate. Againe, to
the Colloſians let no mā iudge
you in receiuīg your meate.collo. 2. &c

Wherby wel appereth that S.
Peters ſentēce was chiefe, as
ſpokē by the chiefe. But herin
yet more to ſpeake, note wel, yt
Peter ofte amonges thappoſtels
vſed ſuche modeſtye &
humilitie (and in ſo doinge did
folow Chriſtes cōmaūdemēt,
which bad ye higher they were
the lower & more humble they
ought to be) yt he dyd not euer
put his high authoritye in executiō:Ciprian ad 
                           •
                        uintinum.
but as S. Ciprian ſaith
yt Peter whome Chriſte made
head of al, and vpon whom he
builded his church whē Paule
dyd contende with him aboute
circumciſion, dyd not reuenge
or boſte him ſelfe that he was
the Prince or chief of al (as he
iuſtly might haue ſaid) but ſtil
he humbled him ſelfe. But god

forbid yt we ſhould aſcribe this
his hūble & gentil ſubmittinge
to the derogation of his highe
power & authoritie: but thinke
yt euer whē Chriſtes glorye or
the profit of ye flocke required
it, then he vſed his ful and high
authoritye, as appereth in the
puniſhīg of Anany & Saphire
Simon Magus. &c. And yet
furthermore, in the primatiue
churche it was rather time (as
is in the .viii. reſponſion) to cal
people in to Chriſtes flocke,
then to ſet euerye man in his
owne place, or to talke then of
rules and orders or of Peters
authority: that was to be done
afterwarde, the people beinge
firſt inſtructed in ye faith. Thē
was rather ye time to ſeke for gethering,
thē for gouernīg. And

if we loke well, we ſhall fynde
not onlye in the ghoſpel before
Chriſtes aſcēſion, but alſo afterwarde
in thactes, that Peter
behaued him ſelfe as head
and Prince, euer when time required
and occaſion ſerued. He
ſpake for al, he anſwred for al,
he for al ſaid to Chriſt beholde
we haue forſaken al and folowed
thee,Math. 19. what rewarde therfore
ſhall we haue? againe he
ſayde to Chriſte ſpeakeſt thou
this parable to vs,Lu. 2. or vnto all?
& when Chriſte aſked whether
they woulde goe awaye alſo
from him,Ioa. 6. Peter alone made
anſwere, ſaying to whom ſhall
we goe? thou haſt the wordes
of lyfe. None dyd thus but
he, and that bycauſe he was
heade.
                  
                     
Howbe it as yet whiles Chriſt
was preſent with them in his
naturall ſhape (for in ye forme
of breade he is euer ſtil preſēt)
it was not meete that his vicare
ſhould greatlye medle.
                  But after thaſcenſion Peter
firſte ſtode vppe as heade and
made the ſermon at the choſynge
of Mathias,Act. 1. and ſayde
oportet we muſt choſe one. &c.
And after when they had receyued
tholy ghoſte and were
illuded of the people,Act. 2. he alone
ſpake and preached conuertinge
them to the faythe .3000.
people at once. Alſo when he &
Iohn came into the temple at
y• .ix. houre of prayer,Act. 3. he alone
ſayde to the lame creple that
whych I haue I geue the, in
the name of Ieſus ariſe. &c.
                  
                     
The lame mā aſked almes of
both, and Peter bade loke vpon
both, but he ſayd not in the
name of bothe, we haue neyther
golde nor ſiluer, yt whiche
we haue we geue thee. &c. But
as head he in ye ſinguler number
as hauinge a ſinguler authority
ſaid (yea though Iohn
one of the chiefe of the appoſtels
were preſent) I haue neyther
golde nor ſiluer, yt whiche
I haue I geue thee. &c. And
this declareth him to be head.
Likewiſe he alone for all as
head,Act. 4. made the oration to pacifie
the people, and he alone
as prince did ſtrike Ananye
and Saphire.Act. 5. Whiche of all
the apoſtels in the preſence of
Peter did anye thynge that ſemed
to be of authoritye aboue

other? but onely he euer in the
preſence of all (as ye heare) vſed
authoritie aboue al.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xiiii. obiection.
               Paule ſaith that nether Peter
nor other apoſtel gaue or added
any thyng to him.Gala. 2. Wherby
it appeareth that Paule gaue
no place to Peter.
               
                  ¶The aunſwere.
                  Paule moſt reuerently gaue
place to Peter as to the head,
and for that cauſe from a farre
he came to Hieruſalem to ſe
Peter whyche was the chiefe
of the Apoſtels. And that
Paule ſayeth that Peter addeth
nothinge to him nor other
Appoſtels, he ſaythe
it, leaſte Goddes glorye

ſhould haue bene diminiſhed,
and doth meane that he hadde
chriſt to be his authour of his
apoſtleſhip and ſender forth, &
that he was not ſent by any any
apoſtle, but euen by Chriſt
hym ſelfe.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xv. obiection.
               Paule ſayth he did reſiſt Peter
euen openlye in his face at
Antioche.
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  Clemēt Origens maiſter ſaith
this Peter was not Peter the
prince of thappoſtels,Cle. 4. diſp. li. & Euſe. li. 2. eccl. ca. 14. but one
named Peter a diſciple one of
the .72. And of this Euſebius
ſpeaketh affirming the ſame.
Howbeit if we graunt yt it was
euen S. Peter the prince of ye
apoſtels no inconuenience wil
folowe. For Paule was equal

with Peter as concerning the
defence of fayth (quoad fidei de
fenſionem) but not concerning
the dignitye of prelacye.
(non quoad dignitatem prelationis).
Agayne an other aunſwere,
if the ruler ye ſuperiour
or heade do erre, in any point
of his faith, or offēd other and
cauſe thē therby to erre, either
by his ſaying or doinge openly
& ſlaūderouſly, then the inferiour
may charitably, eyther
ſecretelye (if that be ſufficient)
admoniſhe: or els openlye reproue,
if ſuche occaſion ſerue
as did here. Neuertheleſſe S.
Hierome, Chriſoſtome, and
Theophilact affirme that S.
Paule in rebukynge Sayncte
Peter did but feane & was not
in earneſt. So yt like as ſ. peter

did feane before the Iews (for
the time, ſo to winne them the
ſoner) in yt he did kepe theyr legals
being amonge the Gentiles:
euen ſo. ſ. Paule whē the
Iewes were gone ſeing yt many
of the Gentils were offēded
with Peters doing, did feane
an earneſt checkinge agaynſte
Peter, ſo to winne ye Gentilles
(and euen ſo nowe he writeth
to the Galath.) ſo that on both
partes there was a godly feaninge:
the one by Peter the ſoner
ſo to winne the Iewes, &
the other by Paule ſo likewiſe
to winne the Heathens. Yea
and Paule vſed this ofte, as
in circumciding Timothe,Act. 16. & in
ſhauing his head in Chēchreis
as perfourming his vow,Act. 18. and
in like maner actes the .20. &c.

And yet beſide this remember
that S. Ciprian ſayeth (as ye
hearde euen now) that Peter,
whom chriſt made head of all
and vpon whom Chriſt buylded
his churche when Paule
did contende with him aboute
circumciſion, dyd not reuenge
or boaſt him ſelfe that he was
the prince or chiefe of all (as
he iuſtly might haue ſayd) but
ſtil he humbled him ſelfe. &c.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xvi. obiection.Gal. 2.
               
               Paule ſayth that authority
was geuen ouer the Heathen
vnto him,glo. ga. 2. haec habet, euan. creditum paulo ita principaliter vt petro, quod verum eſt de predicatione ad quam ſpirituſſanctus eum ſegregauit ſed non in pote ſtate iuriſdictionis. lyke as vnto Peter
ouer the Iewes.
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  Chriſte him ſelfe ſayde
he was ſente to the Iewes

and not to the Heathens, and
bade the Apoſtels go preache
to the Iewes and not to the
Heathēs: for that firſt he was
ſent chiefelye to the Iewes as
to his people: yea and therfore
S. Peter durſte not medle wt
the Heathen till he had his viſion
actes the .x. (whiche was
ſhewed to him as heade and
neyther to Paule, Iohn, nor
other) and therefore chiefelye
and principallye Peter was
ſente to the Iewes, as Paule
was amonges the Heathens,
but yet Chriſte whiche ſayd he
had other ſhepe beſide theym,Ioa. 10. &. 20
bade Peter fede all his ſhepe,
making him chiefe ouer all.
Alſo Paule preached firſte amonges
ye Iewes (as it is in
thactes we ſhuld haue prechedAct. 13.
                     
to you. &c.) but bicauſe he dyd
moſte good & profyte amonge
the Heathē, and the Iewes refuſed
for ye moſte parte his doctrine,
therfore he gloried in the
Heathen, and not in the Iewes,
callinge him ſelfe theyr apoſtle.
But Peter equally profited
in both being head of all,
but bicauſe he was firſte ſēt to
the Iewes Paule calleth him
their apoſtle chiefely, not wtſtā
                     ding
after he won ye people at
ponthum, Galatiam, Capadociā
Aſiam, et Bithiniam. &c.
                  
               
            
            
               ¶The .xvii. obiection.
               Peter knewe no commiſſion
he had ouer the Heathen, as
appeareth Actes the .x. till he
had the viſion.
               
                  The aunſwere.
                  It is ſufficiently▪ anſwered

vnto in the laſt reſpōſiō. Howebeit
this I ſay further, that he
knew his high commiſſion to
be ouer al the flocke of chriſt.

               Hieruſalem ſhoulde rather
be thought to be the heade ſee
then Rome (if any ſuch ſhould
be) where Chriſte worked our
ſaluacion, & where by Chriſt &
by his apoſtles alſo, the ghoſpell
firſt was preached, as the
prophet before had ſaid,Eſai. 2. ye law

                  ¶The anſwere.
                  Firſt note that the biſhoppe
taketh not his dignitye of the
place, but the place of ye biſhop:
not peter of Rome, but Rome
of Peter. Peter was prince of
all before he was biſhoppe in
Rome. Now as for Hieruſalē
which was vtterli to be deſtroied▪
by gods reuēgemēt for chriſtes
deth & their impenitēt hartes
& not one ſtone to be left vp
on an other, god woulde not y•

chriſte talked goinge towarde

ordeyned by the holy ghoſte in
the primatiue churche amonges
the apoſtles, that Hieruſalem
was not onely none of the
principall and metropolitane
ſees, but was ſubiect vnto the
ſee of Caeſaria, as appeareth in
Nicen counſel. Nowe as for
Antioche rather Hieruſalem
ſhould haue bene head, bicauſe
the worde was firſte preached
there, then Antioche, where
through Paules diligence onlye
the name of chriſtians began.
Howbeit the anſwer is yt
Peter the head biſhop made, ye
head ſee: ſo yt if he had cōtinued
there ſtill and there died heade

biſhop then had Antioche bene
the head ſee for euer. But that
was not gods will. Neuertheleſſe
bicauſe Peter was ones
there biſhoppe, and preached
longe amonges them, and conuerted

an earthlye kingdome,Ioa. 28. ſaying,Ioa. 6.
his kingdome was not of this
worlde: yea & whē they would
haue made him a kinge he fled
awaye.
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  This maketh nothinge againſt

the authority of S. Peter,
or his ſucceſſours yt Popes
holines. Chriſte came not to
reigne in a tēporal kingdome.
No true chriſten man euer beleued
or taught the contrarye.
He came not to depriue kinges
of their worldly dignities and
honours. He came to eſtabliſh
a new kingdome whych is ſpiritual,Apoc. 5.
for the ſaluation of the
ſoule: and here of Saint Iohn
ſpeaketh ſaing thou haſt redemed
vs with thy bloud & made
vs a kingdome to oure lorde,
and we ſhall reigne vpon the
earth. This kingdome Chriſt
did ordeine, and made Peter
head here of & his ſucceſſours
for euer: ſo that euery worldly
Kinge or Prince if he wil be in
this kingedome muſte be ſubiecte

to the head of the ſame, or
els ſhall he neuer come to the
kingdome of heauen, which is
thonly cauſe of comming in to
this ſpiritual kingdome here.
As for infidels and heathen
Princes whyche wyl neither
thone nor thother I ſpeke not
of. Chriſte although he were
Prince of ye kinges of ye earth,
as S. Iohn ſaith, and as mā,
not onlye as God, Kinge of
Kinges and Lorde of Lordes
(his veſture wherin that was
written ſignifyed the humanitye
that couered the godhed)
yet when they woulde haue
made him a Kyng, he fled, and
no meruel for he came not therfore.
                  His onlye comminge was to
redeme mā with his bloud, beynge

obediente to his father,
euen vnto the vileſt death: ſo
that he came not to beare here
in the world an earthlye ſcepter:
& for that he ſayde to a certaine
yonge man requiringe
right at his handes againſte ye
iniuries of his brother: O thou
man who appointed me to be
iudge or deuider betwene you
and your brother? as though
he had ſayd, that is not ye cauſe
of my comminge (at the leaſte
waye principallye) to meddel
with ſuche ciuile matters, but
it is to ſuffer death for mans
raunſome. Howe be it, now to
note a worde or .ii. although
Chriſte in his owne perſon,
came not to take in hand anye
earthly kingdō, being notwtſtā
                     ding
as mā king of al kinges,

yet he would his diſciples, that
is to ſay, al that trulye profeſſe
him, be he of the laitie or clergy
Kinge Byſhop or other (for al
ſuche be Chriſtes Diſciples)

                  ¶The anſwere.
                  
                     
By theſe wordes of Chriſte
there is no derogation againſt
his chief miniſter here in earth
no nor anye power geuē to the
laytye here by to be ouer the
cleregye. For here the wicked
Phariſes came craftely being
determined whether he hadde
ſayde yea or naye to haue had
a great vauntage againſt him
ether as a traitour or els as a
diſſembler, & demaunded not
whether they were bounde to
paye tribute, or whether he
could iuſtlie receiue it: but whether
they might geue tribute to
Ceſar or no he being a ſtraūge
prince: which thīg thei thought
to be againſt the fredō of their
lawe. Nowe Chriſte whyche
ſaw al thinges perceuing their
deceytfull hertes ſayd neither

it was lawefull, nor not lawful,
but only bad geue to euery
one that whych was his right
to haue. And this is euery chriſten
mans dutie to do. But yet
further here in to ſpeake, ī caſe
Chriſte then had geuen commaundemēt
to the Iewes as
his people to haue payde tribute
to Ceſar or to other forē
Princes, his commaundemēt
had bene no more againſte the
Clergie, then againſte anye other
of the laytye be he King or
Emperour, if he be a member
of Chriſtes church and a ſhepe
of his flocke.

                  ¶The anſwere.
                  A man might ſaye it was
no more againſte Peter, then
againſte Chriſt him ſelfe King
and Lorde of al, which here of
humilitye thus ſubmitted him
ſelf for al our exāples whether
we be of the clergye or of the
Laitye if we be his Diſciples.
Chriſtes wordes there biddinge
Peter take fourth of the
fiſhes mouth a pece of money
&c. were ful of high miſteries.
How be it here for this matter
it is ſufficient to note, that by
Chriſtes wordes their in the
proceſſe it plainlye apperethe
that bothe Chriſte and Peter
were free from painge any tribute
mony by any law, but yet

to auoyde ſclaunder & offence
for the time chriſt did permitte
that it ſhould be payed.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xxii. obiection.

to gether aboute ſuperioritye,math. 20.
Chriſte ſayde, amonges
the heathen their kinges haue
rule ouer them.Mar. 10. &c. but amonges
you he that wil be greteſt
muſt be as ſeruaunte.Lu. 22.
               
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  By Chriſtes wordes it plainelye
appeareth that he would
haue ſuperioritye amonge his
Diſciples, but yet it ſhoulde be
with all humilitye and godlynes,
and that the ſuperioritye
or primacie ſhould be without
all ambicion or vaine glorye.
Chriſt ſaid not here, their ſhalbe
amōg you none greter then

other: he ſaide not, amonge my
Diſciples whyche profeſſe me,
there ſhal be no ruler no Kinge
or Prince. &c. but he plainlye
deſcribeth what maner of men
they ſhould be whych amonge
chriſten people ought to beare
rule office and authoritie whether
thoffice and burden be eccleſiaſticall
or polytical: they
ought to rule to ye profite and
commoditye of their ſubiectes
& not to their own luchre pōpe
or vain glorye. For this to rule
is counted mere tirānye which
heathē Princes oft vſe. Amōg
chriſten men it ought to be onlye
to gods glorye & honor, remembring
S. Ambroſe,Li. 9. trip. ca 30. ſaing
to the Emperour Theodoſius
whiche was that his ſubiectes
were ioined vnto him not only

by kind and nature, but alſo by
the commen ſeruice of one god
which is Maſter & lorde ouer
al, both ouer ye Prince and his
ſubiectes. And here note that
chriſt in ye former wordes, ſaīg
amōg ye heathēs their Kinges
haue power. &c. but it ſhal not
be ſo amōg you &c. ſpeaketh to
al hꝭ flocke as wel to ye laity as
to ye clergie, yt is to ſaye, to all yt
be ſubiectes & members of his
yt none of them ſhould rule, be
he Prince or other, after ye maner
of the heathē, which (ſaith
Origē there vpō) only to their

and yt violētly ofte wt ſpoylīg &
killīg not knowīg god,Chriſtꝰ non prohibuit principatum ſimpliciter ſed tiranni cum ac violentum. do exerciſe
great tirāny ouer their ſubiectes.
But thus it ſhall not
be (ſaithe Chriſte) amonge
you, nor anye that profeſſe my

name, whiche know that there
is one god aboue, Lorde ouer
king and ſubiect here in earth,
and ye both Maiſter & ſeruaūt
muſt geue a count as ſeruauntes
together vnto yt one lorde
and god. Ye therefore when
you rule ſe it be with all humilitye
euer loking to their commoditie
ouer whom ye do rule:
to the honour & glorye of god,
& not to your owne pompe or
vaineglorye, to youre owne
pride or couetouſnes.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xxiii. obiection.
               S. Peter forbiddeth any ſpiritual
ſhepherd to beare anye
lordelye rule ouer ye flocke,1. Pet. 5. but
willeth to fede them with all
dilygence. &c.
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  That which is in the laſte

reſpōſion wil ſerue to anſwere
here vnto this obiection. For
neither Chriſte nor Peter forbiddeth
rule gouernaunce or
primacye, ſo that it be accordinge
to the right rule and order,
with al humilitie godlines
and charitie. Both Chriſt and
Peter deſcribe and appoint an
order as wel to the ciuil ruler
(beinge a Diſciple of our ſauioure)
as to the eccleſiaſticall:
notwithſtandinge the eccleſiaſtical
example in ruling, being
more perfite, more high in dignitye,
and the eye of the bodye,
requireth a ſtraiter examination
with al perfection & godlines,
he to gouerne the ſhepe
& ſubdue the wolfes,Haec diuus Barnardus ad euge. he beinge
in the churche of Chriſte the
great prieſt, ye higheſt Buſhop

the Prince of all miniſters,
the very ayer to the Apoſtels,
Abel in primacye, Noe in gouernaunce,
in patriarcſhip Abrahā,
in order Melchiſedech,
in dignitye Aaron, in authoritye
Moiſes, in iudgemēt Samuel,
in power Peter, & in anoynting
Chriſt, one ſhepherd
oboue al, hauing power to loſe
& binde. Wherfore (now to returne)
a chriſtiā ruler whether
he be of the clergye or of the
laytye can not, nor ought to
beare anye lordlye rule after
the maner of the heathē Princes,
which like tirātes vſe their
ſubiectes onlye rigorouſlye to
their owne vauntage. But a
chriſtiās rule and gouernaūce
ouer his ſubiectes is nothinge
els but a charge and a ſolicitude

or carefulnes ouer his
brethren in Chriſte, and a baliſhippe
or ſtewardſhippe ouer
them that be ſeruauntes together
wyth hym vnder god the
commen lorde and Maſter of
all.

ſayth the Apoſtell.
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  Seinge al chriſten men in
baptim do promiſſe and vowe
to fight vnder Chriſte, the forſayd
text doth as wel bind the
laitye as the cleregye beinge
chriſten men: ſo that no chriſtē
man ought ſo to medel with
ſeculer buſines that he forgote

his ſpirituall dutye: whyche
ought to be ye chiefeſt care of al

by their worldlye buſines
and earthlye ſubſtaunce,
but rather thereby great ayde
and helpe (vſinge them wel as

                  Thappoſtel here as wel commaundeth

hereby bynde ye ſhepherd to be

ſhepeherde to pay any tribute
to any membre of the miſticall
body he being the head therof.
I mighte here nowe declare
how not onely among the chriſten
flocke the prieſtes euer
were and ought to be fre from
al exactions tooles, and tributes,
but alſo amonge the Heathē
people they were euer free,
as ye rede in the geneſis in the
time of famine in Egipt: And
likewiſe in the oration of Sun
machus cōſul of Rome, to Valentinian,
Theodoſius, & Arthadius,
emperours, which he
made agaynſt the Chriſtians.
So that Paule did binde no
prieſtes by yt text being amōge
chriſtē men to pay any tribute
or toole. Howbeit if prieſtes or

biſhops of chriſtēdome, yea or
the heade biſhop the pope himſelfe
were in a Heathē realme
he or thei ought to be ſubiectes
to the lawes there, and pay tribute
or toole: For chriſtes law
taketh no right or duety frō any
party. And that is it which
Paule in the former text to the
Romaynes dothe declare: and
Peter alſo, bidding al to be ſubiecte
to kinges and other &c.
euerye one to his ſuperiour? or
to whom he is ſubiect by lawe
or ordre. And this both Peter
and Paule commaunde: for y•
ther were ſome which thought
(but falſely) that chriſtes law
was ſo free, that if ſeruauntes
came ones there vnto, they
ſhoulde be no more bounde to
their mayſters: & yt al chriſtiās

were clerely deliuered from al
Heathē authoritie and duties
doinge. But agaynſte theſe,
Paule biddeth all be ſubiect &
obediēt to authoritie & power
and obſerue and kepe all ciuil
ordres there where thei as ſubiectes
do inhabite. And this to
be referred as well to the clergye
as to the laytye.

ſee geuen him by Chriſte:
whiche ſee by worldlye power
and ſchiſmatical counſels then
did ſeme to haue bene in daunger
notwithſtanding Chriſtes
promiſſe, that hel gates ſhould
not preuayle agaynſte it, that
is to laye, neyther infidelitye,
hereſye, nor ſchiſmaticy. And
theſe eſtabliſhinges of the ſee
of Rome by Emperours lawes
to be chiefe and heade, and

al other ſees, yea al chriſtē mē
to be obedient hereunto, was
euē as Nabuchodonoſer king
of Babilon ſeinge the wonderous
miracle of preſeruing the
iii. men lyinge in the hote fournes
did make a law that there
was no god but the god of Sidrac,
Miſac, & Abedenago, &
that who ſo blaſphemed againſt
him ſhould dye. Here in
Nabuchodonoſer did nothing
els but eſtablyſhe that whiche
he ſawe throughe miracle by
god him ſelfe to be required of
all men: and ſo likewiſe theſe
good emperours did nothinge
els here in Peters ſeat but vp
holde that whiche was geuen
by chriſte him ſelfe from the beginning.
Now to yt of ſ. Greg▪
howe he refuſed to be called

the vniuerſall biſhop. &c. So
it is that one named Iohn thē
biſhoppe of Conſtantinople
dyd greatly ſtriue to haue had
his ſeate chiefe aboue Peters
contrarye to Chriſtes ordynaunce,
and wrote hym ſelfe
the vniuerſall biſhoppe: but
S. Gregory then biſhoppe of
Rome Peters ſucceſſour gretlye
withſtandinge that wicked
man and moſte godlye defendinge
Peters authorytye amonges
other thinges ſayeth,
that neyther Peter nor any of
his ſucceſſours euer wrote him
ſelfe the vniuerſall biſhoppe:qui vniuerſalem ſe facit epiſcopum aliis (inquit▪ epiſcopatus honorē detrahit, quen ſibi arroga vniuerſū hae Greg.
whyche had bene to haue taken
awaye quite all honoure
(ſayeth he) from all other biſhoppes:
for he hauynge all

nothing had bene left behind▪
And therefore Sayncte Gregory
him ſelfe wrote, as al the
holy biſhoppes of Rome haue
done euer ſince, Gregorye the
ſeruaunt of the ſeruauntes of
god. &c. And herein he folowed
the example and biddinge
of Chriſte, whyche was, that
as he came to ſerue and not to
be ſerued, ſo woulde he all his
the higher they were ſo muche
more humble and meeke euer
to be. Notwithſtanding almoſte
euer ſince Peters time
till Sayncte Gregorye came,
the heade biſhoppes in the ſee
of Rome wrote theym ſelues
Byſhoppes of the vniuerſall
churche of Chriſte (but not
vniuerſall Biſhoppes) as appeareth

by Sixtus the fyrſte
Theophilus, Stephanus,
with manye mo: So that it
moſte euidentelye appeareth
that they falſelye do lye whych
ſaye that by Phocas or by Cō
                     ſtantine
the ſee of Rome was
made chyefe and heade, and
not before ſo taken. But yet
herin to ſpeake a litle further;
ſome affirme that Peter of humilitye
and all euer after euen
Sayncte Gregorye and other
refuſed to be called the vniuerſall
Byſhoppe, but yet euerye
one of theym was the vniuerſall
Biſhoppe. Yea and ſayncte
Gregorye him ſelfe affirmeth,
that by this texte Paſce oues
fede or gouerne myſhepe, cure
& charge ouer ye whole church

was geuen by chriſt to S. Peter
being prince of all the apoſtels.
Was he not then the vniuerſal
biſhoppe, the chiefe and
the heade? Saincte Gregorye
of humility to auoyde ambitiō
refuſed to be called the vniuerſall
or generall biſhoppe, neuertheles
he was ye head and
chiefe of all. And therfore he
neyther would nor ought ſuffer
the biſhoppe of Antioche to
be called the vniuerſal biſhop.
Moreouer we maye thinke, yt
that holy councell of Calcedon
would not haue willed ſayncte
Gregorye to be called the vniuerſall
biſhop, if the holy ghoſt
had not that willed, yea and
that according to gods worde.

whoſe time was the .vi. generall
councel) ſent to the emperour
beinge at conſtantinople
to haue his election allowed
before he would be conſecrate.
And this accordinge to the ordre
then accuſtomed: ſo did Vifalianus
and S. Gregory alſo:
as it is in the .63. diſt. in the
chapiter beginning Agatho.
               
               
                  ¶Thanſwere.
                  The time was when neither
the heade biſhop ye biſhoppe of
Rome, nor other biſhops were
choſen withoute the conſente
not onelye of the Emperoure
and the magiſtrates, but alſo

not wtout the conſēt of the multitude
of the comen people.
                  And this the clargye (thoughe
it was theyr onelye office to
choſe) did then ſuffer, yea, then
greately deſired yt it ſo mighte
be, partelye to the intente that
agaynſt the wicked & agaynſt
tyrannye they mighte the rather
be defended with the temporall
ſword, and partlye that
the people mighte the rather
geue eare to chriſtes doctryne

                     e more vertuouſly hauing
him theyr heade & ſhepeherde
whome they loued and
choſe them ſelues. What meruel
was it then that themperours
cōſent (ye chiefe of the comen
people) was deſired in
that electiō? what maketh this
agaynſte our holye father the

popes authoritie? Surely nothīg
at al. Howbeit in proceſſe
of time manye inconueniences
riſing herby (as tirāny ſiniſter
affectiō with diuerſe other corruptions)
it was lafte to the election
of the clergy agayne: &
that euen by the conſent of the
holye emperours: as ye maye
rede in graciā diſt. 63. & in many
other places mo. Wherfore Hildebrād
(which after was pope
named Greg. ye .vii.) anſwered
vnto Otto Archb. of Colen coming
frō Hen. the .iiii. emperour,
that neither emperoure nor any
other but onely the clargye
had any power or Authoritye
in choſing the biſhop of Rome:
& that the permiſſion or ſufferāce
yt emperours for certayne
cauſes had had therin was iuſtlye

for more lawful & more reaſonable
cauſes taken awaye.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xxxi. obiection.
               At Nicē counſel ye biſhop of
Rome was not preſent. &c.
               
                  The aunſwere.
                  What then? his authoritye
was there (as it euer was and
is in all councels lawfully gethered)
by his legates. Theyr
names at that time were, Victor,
Vincentius, and Oſius biſhops
of Corduba. Yea & there
it was declared & confirmed
(not inſtiTute: for yt was done
by Chriſte) that no generall
councel ſhoulde be kept without
the conſent & authority of
the biſhop of Rome. So y• although
ye bring neuer ſo many
coūcels wherein the biſhop
of Rome in his owne perſon

was not preſent, yet his authoritye
and power was neuer abſēt.
And here note further that
in the .iiii. firſte and chiefe general
councels, wherunto S.
Gregory ſaide he gaue credite
euen as to the .iiii. euāgeliſtes,
all the doinges were referred
to be iudged and confirmed by
the authoritie of the byſhop of
Rome.
                  At Nicen coūſel (which was
the firſt of ye . iiii.) they did ſend
this epiſtle folowing. Vnto the
moſt bleſſed Silueſter biſhop
of the citye of Rome, Oſius biſhop
of Corduba, Victor, and
Vincentius prieſtes of Rome
with the reſt of ye biſhops .318,
ſende greting in our lorde.
                  What ſo euer we haue ordeyned
in this counſell of Nicen,

we deſire that it may be confirmed
by the agrement of youre
mouth. And in the ſecond councel
which was the firſt at Conſtantinople,
al that bleſſed cō
                     panye
there gethered obeid vnto
Damaſus Byſhope of Rōe

& Eunomiū. Likewiſe at
the thirde chiefe general councel
which was holden at Epheſus
Neſtorius was cōdemned
by Celeſtine then Buſhope of
Rome being chiefe iudge. And
finallye at Chalcedon, the laſt
of the .iiii. all the councel there
gethered did write as in moſte
ſubmiſſion, vnto the moſt holy
Buſhope of Rome Leo, Byſhope
of thuniuerſal church &c.

Ireneus biſhop of Lyons did
reſiſte Victor biſhop of Rome
euē ſone after ye apoſtels time
concerning ye feaſt of Eaſter.
And Anicetꝰ biſhop of Rome
euen immediatly after thappoſtels
gaue place to Policarpꝰ
S. Iohns diſciple.
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  Anicetus, then Pius & after
them Victor, ſucceſſours vnto
peter made decrees cōcerning
eaſter. And ye Eaſt church firſt
did reſiſt ye ordre bycauſe they
hadde kepte an other cuſtome
(whiche was after the Iewes
faſhion) takē of S. Iohn euā
                     geliſt.
Then Policarp. biſhop
of Smirma in ye greke church,
yea & being S. Iohns diſclple
alſo, came to Rome to Anicetꝰ
to aſke councell of the matter.

And here marke ye al that they
dyd was to edifye & not to deſtroy:
and marke alſo that Policarpus
acknowledged ſupirioritye
when he came to holye
Anicetus Byſhope of Rome
about the determinatiō of Eaſter:
notwithſtanding he was
S. Iohns diſciple, a Byſhop,
yea & that in the greke church.
Agayne, after this when Victor
that holy martir about the
ſame mater would haue excominicate
(as heade of all) the
buſhoppes of the greke church
Ireneus exhorted him to the
contrarye leſt more trouble diſcorde
and diſquietnes thereby
myght haue riſen. What maketh
this obiectiō now againſt
the popes authority? Ireneus

god knoweth acknowledged al
to be ſubiecte to that highe authoritye
as ye may rede in his
worke li. 3. ca. 3. et. 4.

                  ¶The anſwere.
                  Chriſt thereby did no more
burthē the Clergie then he did

that he and his then ſhoulde
come without all worldlye honour

bothe for our example, and
alſo that infidels ſhould haue
no occaſion to ſaye that he had
inſtitute his religion, by violence,

they wold haue done, if he had
commen as he might if it had

would not all thereby ſhortlye
come to confuſion call to your
remēbraūce (I pray you) how
y• Chriſt did ſend his Diſciples
twiſe forthe: ones, long before
his paſſion, and thother time
after his reſurrection. At the
firſt ſending he bad them go al
porely (knowing that al neceſſaries
then ſhould be prouided
for them) to with drawe all
men therby from Auarice: and
that nothing ſhuld be an hindraunce
to the ſettinge fourthe
of his Ghoſpel. But at the ſeconde

tyme of ſendynge them
fourth whyche was after his
reſurrection and aſcenſion (he
byddynge them tarye tyl they
had receiued tholy ghoſt) they
were charged to take all thinges
neceſſarye: yea and ſhortly
after Saint Paule him ſelfe
dyd appoint (beinge euen led
with the ſame ſpiryte of God)
that no mo pore ignoraunte
fiſhers ſhould be made Biſhoppes
or prieſtes but that they
ſhould be bothe doctours and
men of good hoſpitalitye. At
the beginnynge all was rawe
ſymple and rude: yea and at
that time when the Buſhoppes
were ſuche as hadde bene
but poore ignoraunte fyſhers,
then the verye Princes and

rulers came and layde al their
goodes at their fete. If ye now
wil nedes haue ye one ye muſt
then nedes haue ye other. How
be it like as at the begynninge
of the worlde the chiefe Kinge
Adam oure firſte parent was
al naked & bare: whiche thinge
can not proue that all Kinges
ſince ſhould be as pore: euen ſo
in ye primatiue church to ſhew
the pouertye of the Apoſtles,
can not proue that nowe all
ſhould continewe in lyke ſtate:
no more then it wil folow that
a childe newlye borne & wrapt

and want of al perfection, lackinge
knowledge, lackinge

in the ſame miſerable eſtate.
                  
                     
Marke wel this ſimilitude,
ſeinge Paule lickeneth ye miſtical
body vnto ye natural bodye
of man. This both well proue
that al ought not to be brought
to the weake and vnperfite eſtate
of the primatiue churche,
whych yet heretikes for a confuſiō
euer deſired to haue. But
here note alſo, yt we muſt not
chaunge that which was then
in the primatiue churche but

Againe though Chriſt as man

& for our inſtruction, yet as
mā he was king & lord of al, hauing
ſo writtē in the hemme of

nether choſe rich prīces to be hꝭ
diſcip. nor willed his diſci. after

plainly by facte yt which
he taught in worde ſayinge be
not careful for erthly thinges.
but firſt ſeke ye kingdome of heuen

he yt prouided princes to laye
their goodes at Peters feete,
hath euer ſince ꝓuided for Peters
ſee & will do ſtil to ye ende.
He biddeth al be pore in ſpirit,
but as for to be pore in goodes
no mā is cōmaūded, but rather
cōtrari ſeīg he bade al mē make

frēdes of ye wicked Māmon, &
that it is more bleſſed to geue

               Chriſt came not to beare rule
but to be in all ſubiection, & he
would his Diſciples to folowe
his ſtepes, both Peter & other.
Thinke that Chriſtes wordes
were not contrarye to his doinge.
&c.
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  Chriſt came firſt moſt humbly
for our erudicion, but afterwarde
he boldlye ſayde, all power
is geuen to me both in heuen
& in earth. God the father
then did exalt him cauſing al in
heauen hel and earth to bende
and bowe vnto him: and then
he gaue to his diſciples power

to worke miracles to forgeue
ſinnes. &c. Then he appointed
Peter to be porter of heauen
gates: then he made him chiefe
ſhepherd ouer al his flocke &c.
Yea, and yet beſide this Chriſt
in the time of al his ſubiection
and baſing him ſelfe would be
taken & counted to be Maſter
ouer his flocke: ye cal mē Maſter
(ſaith he) and ſo I am. &c.
What then (I praye you) maketh
it againſt Chriſtes Maſterſhipe
or ſuperioritie that he
ſo to teache humility humbled
him ſelfe? yea or what proueth
that leſſon or that example againſt
Peters primacie? Surelye
nothing at all.

               ¶The .xxxvii. obiection.
               In the ſixt councel at Cartage
it was decreid that no appeale
ought to be to Rome, but
ought to be determined with
in the countrye.
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  We rede in Socrates hiſtorye
that there was a determination
made for conſtitucions
prouincial at ye councel of Cō
                     ſtātinople.Li. 9. trip. ca. 13.
And the ſame be ſtil
allowed & approued. But ther
be none of thē which be to ye derogation

of the ſee of Rome.
                  For there it was decreed alſo,
that next to Rome as chiefe
Conſtantinople ſhould haue
his ſee. Now if ye greke church
decreed (as ye ſaye) at yt coūcel
to haue al cauſes wtout appellation
to Rome, to be finiſhed
there wtin ye ſame prouince, we
muſt eyther ſaye that it was to
be vnderſtanded in inferioure
cauſes, or els yt, that reſtraint
notwtſtanding, they ſtill did acknowledge
their obedinēce to
ye ſee apoſtolike of Rome. For
els how could this their doing
agre wt ye appellations had, frō
yt beginning (as appereth in ye
v. probatiō) to ye ſee of Rome?
Therfore thꝭ councel being catholike
did decree nothynge againſt
ye faith of the vniuerſall

church obſerued from ye beginning
both in the Greke and latine
church.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xxxviii. obiection.
               In the .vi. & .vii. article of the
councel Nicē it was decreed y•
in thorient the biſhop of Antioche
ſhould be chiefe: in Egipt
ye biſhop of Alex: about Rome
the biſhoppe of Rome: and in
Iury the biſhop of Hieruſalē.
               
                  ¶The aunſwere.
                  Hiſtories from time to time
haue fully declared yt the ſee of
Rome euer hath had ye preeminēce
ſince Peters martirdome
ouer al chriſtēdome. Loke in
hiſt. tripertita. li. 4. ca. 6. ix. xii. 14▪
19. 23. 24. 29. et li. 5. ca. 29. Therfore
al the determinacion that
was had in Nicē coūcell muſt
nedes ſtand & agre therewt as
no doubt it doth, if it be trulye

applied. For if ye marke well
Oſius biſhop of Corduba in ye
abſence of the biſhop of Rome.
was the chiefe in ye coūcel, only
bicauſe he was ībaſſador there
in ye place of ye biſhop of Rome.
Alſo at yt time it was decreed yt
ye .3. patriarchal ſees ſhuld kepe
theyr dignytyes without anye
derogacion to the ſee of Rome
which then was declared to be
ye head ouer al. And likewiſe in
the great councell of Lateranenſe
vnder the moſt holy father
Innocentius the thyrde
were eſtabliſhed the olde and
auncient priueleges of the patriarchall
ſees of Conſtanti.
Alexan. Antioche and Hiern.
So yt they & euery of thē firſte
receiuing ye paule at Rome as
of ye chiefe & head of all mighte

afterwarde communicate the
ſame to all other accordinglye
being vnder their iuriſdiction:
and alſo might cary theyr croſſes
mall places of chriſtēdome
Rome only except, and where
the pope or his legate ſhoulde
be preſent. The priuelege alſo
of the ſee of Rome to be aboue
all other patriarchall ſees (as
to whom all other owe obedience,
euē from the beginning)
ye haue playnlye declared in ye
decrees diſtinct .80.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xxxix. obiection.
               The ſee of Hieruſalem in the
councel of Conſtantinople (as
ye haue li. 9. tripert. cap. 14.) was
declared to be the mother of al
churches.
               
                  The aunſwere.
                  As ye haue in the ſame chapiter,

that counceil acknowledgeth
Rome to be the chiefe, &
that Conſtantinople ſhuld be
the chefe ſee next to Rome, and
yt hieruſalem there had a great
priuelege graunted: for that it
was the mother of all other
churches (as it is there put in
the margente) that is to
ſaye, the mother and firſte in
time, but not in dignitie. As is
further declared in ye aunſwer
to the .xviii. obiection.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xl. obiection.
               The .xii. appoſtels did choſe
the .vii. deacōs,Act. 6. and not Peter
onely. Wherfore it ſemeth ther
by that Peters authoritye is
not aboue the reſt.
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  As for choſing inferior miniſters,
it is done by eueri biſhop

in his dioces: as it hath bene euer
from the begīning to this
day, Paules example agreing
therwith: yea and at that time
they vſed to haue the conſēt of
ye multitude, bicauſe as Paule
ſayth they ought to haue good
teſtimonye of them whiche be
without.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xli. obiection.
               Al the apoſtels did put their
handes vpon the .vii. deacons.Act. 6.
               
               
                  The aunſwere.
                  That was done for yt through
the prayer of them al together
rhey might receiue more aboū
                     dant
grace.
                  Howbeit an other aunſwere
to theſe two obiections maye
be thys that Peter by his priuelege
might alone haue choſē
Mat. & alſo ye .vii. deacons but

he would not for ſūdry cauſes:
one, leſte he thereby ſhoulde
haue ben thought to haue geuen
and cōferred grace of him
ſelfe: an other, for humility: the
thirde, for to kepe vnitye and
peace: the forth, to folow chriſtes
example and doctrine whiche
bade the higher you be ſo
muche humble youre ſelfe the
more: the fifte and laſt, thereby
to geue honor and reuerence
to the holye councels. Yea and
here note that ſeinge Peter
was not ordeined to putte in
execution the primacye but after
Chriſtes death and paſſion
therefore bicauſe of humilitye
Peter was lothe at the beginning
to take his authority vppon
him but in maner as halfe
againſt his wil: ſo that by litle

and litle his authoritie daylye
increaſed more and more.
               
            
            
               ¶The .xlii. obiection.
               The pope was neuer ruler
of al the world: nether in Inde
Perſidia, Egipt. &c.
               
                  ¶The anſwere.
                  What then? no more is he receyued
in Bohem, nor in parte
of Germany. Is he not therefore
the heade of the whole
churche? yes truly. He is receiued
of all that be neyther infidels
heretikes nor ſciſmatiks:
which be only conuenticles of
the deuil, and not membres of
chriſtes church. But he ſhal be
head of all, when that ſayinge
of Paule ſhalbe fulfilled,Rom. 11. that
all the reſt of the iewes ſhalbe
ſaued,Ioa. 10. & yt ther ſhal be of al one
ſhepecote and one ſhepeherde.

& prieſtes al equall. &c.
               
                  ¶The aunſwere.
                  Though that wer moſt true
(as it is moſt falſe) yt Biſhops
& priſtes wer al equal: yet doth
not ye proue yt ther is noheed of
the church. Howbeit to anſwer
to S. Hiero. he in that epiſtel
doth extolle ſo highly the office
of a prieſt, thereby to ſuppreſſe
a certayne deacons arrogancye
whych preferred him ſelfe
to prieſtes. Writers oft vſe for
theyr purpoſe to do, as a man
that would make a croked rod
ſtreight, doth bend it as farre
the contrarye waye: And ſo
dydde Sayncte Hierome in
that epiſtle, where as in other

places he both declareth the office
of a Byſhope and ye office
of a prieſte to be diuerſe (ye one
to be a name of age,Hiero. ad ruſticum. the other
of dignity) and alſo highly ſetteth
fourth the preemynence &
authority of the high Biſhope

The day was appointed them
for their merit: the place for

So that there ſhoulde

He neither put him to death,
nor cauſed him,vir mortis es id e
                           •
                        t, morte dignus. Lira. 3, reg. 2. to be put to
death. But he put him forth of
his great office and dignitie: to
ſignifye (inquit gloſ. iii. reg. ii.)
that the Iewes ſhould not be
vtterly deſtroyed tho

towarde the ende of the world

That expulſinge of Abiathar
the high prieſte was not done
without the ſpirite of prophecye,
and that the ſcripture of
God (i. Reg. ii) ſpoken of Hely
the prieſt might be fulfilled,
where it was ſayd to him that
for the wickednes of his ſōnes
Ofne and Phinees all his poſteritye,
ſhould loſe thoffice of

the high prieſtehode. And here
note that Aarō the high prieſt
had .ii. ſonnes Eleazar & Ithamar,
& that to Eleazar and his
poſteritye that highe office by
gods oppointmēt did perteine.
How be it through offences cō
                     mitted,
god turned it for a time
vnto Ithamar & after to Hely
and laſt of all to Abiathar of
the ſame lyne: but now in the
beginnīg of Salomōs reigne
God turned it from Abiathar
(whyche came of Ithamar) to
Sadoch whyche came of Eleazar,
to whome and to whoſe
poſteritye god appointed firſte
the highprieſtes office. Marke

Here by puttīg Abiathar forth
of the high Prieſtes rowme &

               King Alex. wrote to Ionathas

Iudas Mathias & other: So
that he now receyued not this

which had no power to gyue it

had had authority & power in

ſurelye nothinge at all.
No more then it were againſt

it was then called ye prieſtly

but now contrariwiſe it
is called a kinglye prieſtehode in

And this is now required in ye

               As tholde law was a figure
of the new, ſo was ye olde prieſthode
a figure of the prieſt

               ¶The .lix. obiectiō.
               Oh howe many ſcriptures
haue bene wtin theſe .xxii. yeares
brought & cited againſt the
popes authority? The anſwer.
               Euer whē ye heare any ſcripture
alleged (ſayth Origē vpō
Mathue) cōtrary to yt which ye
vniuerſal church obſerueth beleue
thē not. Geue no credit to
thē, for they would but deceiue
you wt falſe allegatiōs or falſe
applicatiōs of ſcriptures cōtrary
to ye meaning of tholy goſt.

Thinke yt ſcrypture is no ſcripture,
if the true intente & meaning
be not there: yea if therin
ye folow not ye authority of the
churche. For howe ſhall we
know (I pray you) that Moyſes
wrote al yt is in hꝭ .v. bokes,
ſeing we neuer ſaw his hande
writing? Yea & though we had
ſene it, howe could we know it
to be his hāde he being dead ſo
lōg ago? or if we knew al this,
how were we ſure yt all that he
wrote was true, & yt god ſpake
vnto him? And ye ſame is likewiſe
to be demaunded of al the
prophetes writinges. If ye ſay
chriſt bare teſtimony of Moyſes,
of ye law, & of yt prophetes,
then I aſke further, howe ye
know by chriſtes teſtimonye yt
theſe which we rede be Moyſes
or the prophetes writinges

although we graūt y• by chriſtꝭ
teſtimony Moy. & ye ꝓph. wer
true & faithful? Yea yet further
how know ye yt chriſt bare teſtimonye
of Moyſes & ye prophetes
whō ye neuer heard preche
nor teache? If ye ſay by ye euā
                  geliſtes,
thē I turne agayne &
aſke how ye know theſe to be ye
ghoſpels of Mathue, Marke
or Luke, ſeing ye neuer ſawe
theyr hādes writing? And if ye
had ſene thē, yet ye knewe thē,
not: but ſuppoſe ye know them
how do ye wote yt all is true yt
thei wrote, ſeing eueri mā may
be deceyued, yea ſpeciallye
Marke & Luke whiche wrote
but of here ſay, & dyd neuer ſee
chriſt? If ye ſay, they wrote being
taught by tholy goſt, then
ye ſame doubt cometh agayne,

howe ye knowe tholy ghoſte
taught thē, or how know ye yt
theſe be their writinges wtout
corruptiō or mixture? Cā ye by
any menes ſaue or defēd thautority
of ye ſcripture, but onlye
by thauthority of ye eccleſiaſtical
tradiciōs? ſurely by none other.
Ye know which be the canonical
ſcriptures, & ye true ſēſe
therof, only by ye teſtimonye of
ye church vnderſtād & receiued
by ſucceſſiō of the fathers frō ye
beginnīg til this our time. Dioniſe,
Clemēt, Policarpe, Ignatiꝰ,
Tertuliā. Origē, Ciprian,
Athana. Baſil. Hilari, Chriſo.
Ambroſe, Hierome & Auſtine
wt al holy mē euer ſince had neuer
other rule to know ye truth
of ſcripture by, but onely yt comē
profeſſiō & cōſēt of al the fathers
euer in their time by ſucceſſiō
                  
linking together their teſtimonies
for ye ful knowledge
of ye truth. This is was & euer
ſhalbe ye very piller & foūdaciō
wherunto we muſt nedes lein.
So yt we haue receiued ye truth
of ye ghoſpel by ye eccleſiaſticall
tradiciō rather thē by writing:
yea & ye certitude of our religiō
& ſure fayth hath not depēded
frō ye begining vpō ye authority
of ye goſpels writē, but rather
cōtrarywiſe ye authoriti of ye goſpel
writtē hath depēded vpon
the certitude of our religiō. &c.
Paule whē he ſayd if an angel
frō heuē preche any other ghoſpel
thē thꝭ, curſed be he, did not
meane of any ghoſpel writen,
which thē had no authority ī ye
church, though ſone after ye goſpels
writē for certē cauſes, receued
their authority of ye church

And here is now to be noted yt
we rede in Euſebius how that
Serapion that learned & holy
biſhop of Antioche ſayd,Li. 6. cap, 10. we receyue
Peter & other of thappoſtels
euen as chriſt,Serapiō the viii. Biſh. of Antioche wtin xl. yeres after S. Iohn Euang. he was borne. but we refuſe
ſuch thinges as be falſely
writen vnder their names, bicauſe
we haue no ſuch tradiciō
of the church. &c. This was ye
rule then to know thinges by,
when they euer receiued al as
it were by hād one of an other.
Thē they perceiued yt thauthority
of ye eccleſiaſtical tradicyō
extēded much further then the
authority of ye ghoſpel writen:
& yt in al doubtful caſes it muſt
geue ſētēce & iudgemēt whych
is truth & which is falſily. So
yt here nowe to cōclude though
heretikes wraſt neuer ſo mani
textes of ſcripture agaynſt the

popes authority, it maketh no
force, nor proueth any thing agaynſte
our purpoſe. And yet
moreouer hereby appeareth y•
though there were no ſcripture
at al to proue the popes authority
by (as there be very mani)
yet yt made nothing contrarye
herevnto, ſeing that by ſucceſſeſſion
it hath bene ſtil receiued
euē frō Peters time hitherto.

ſhall not we then thinke ye like
to be done to ſciſmatikes and
obſtinate heretikes gods extreme

where ye ſay ye ſterers to murther
be the children of the deuil
(therby to bringe the Popes
holines & other in to contempt
as murtherers or ſekers of

as to reuenge his owue cauſe

ſo ſeketh to haue gods enemies

puniſhed which be obſtinate in
infidelitye in hereſy or in ſchiſmes,
he ſeketh not hꝭ owne glory

not his owne quarel but gods
quarel. To be remiſſe, to be ful
of lenity, to be ientil & colde, in
your owne cauſe, ī your owne
iniury & wrōg ſufferīg, is both
godlie and vertuous: but to be
tōge tied in gods cauſe, & ſo to
ſuffer hꝭ glory to be diminiſhed
(as it hath bene greatly in thꝭ

both wicked & damnable. Alſo
where ye ſay god abhorreth ſo
wers of diſcord &c. do ye thinke
them to be ſowers of diſcorde,
which being gods high officers
do ſeke meanes to puniſh abhominable
vices, ſciſmes, & hereſies?

               The church of chriſt is vnknowen
and al they whych be of yt

For none be of that church but

without ſpot: thou art all faire

with manye textes mo for the

can not be knowen, how ſhal y•
head be knowē? And if none be
of the church but ye good, who
be then of the churche & where
be they? Euerie man knoweth
that ye ſmaler nomber is euer
ye better: in which nomber neither
the Pope nor the infinite

taketh his part can be coūted.

For their nomber is the greter

Therfore we muſte nedes cō

thꝭ point, in ye ſtate of grace or
not, ī vertue or in vice. And to
this do agre chriſtes parables

& of ye .x. virgins .v. wiſe & .v

now ſhew yt onlye the good in

& agrement here in maketh ye
church to be knowē. How be it
if ye take or count all faithfull
people which are ſinners to be

to be the light, ſo (no doubte) y•
good & bad do not al pertaine
to one cōpanye, but cōſidering

as iuſt mē) in that they be
knit together ī one faith which
is ye light of al faithful ſoules,
ſo they are al coūted to be wt in
the cumpany of thunitie of the
church militant:Ex cE parte (inquiunt ſcholaſtici) qua fideles peccatores ſūt tenebrae & iuſti luz, non poſſunt pertinere ad vnā & eandē ſocietatē: ſed ex ea parte qua in vna integritate fidei (que lux eſtanimarum fideliū) conueniunt, optime poſſunt pertinere ad vnam & eandem ſanctam communitatem vnitatis eccleſiae.

by appeareth, yt only vnitye &
agremēt vnder one head ī one
faith in one baptim & in one order
of ſacramētꝭ, ſacramētalꝭ,
ceremonies &c. in one hope, one
charity, in one ſpirit, & ī one reward

to be receued of one head
in heauē doth make the churche
of chriſt to be knowē: but al we
both good or bad do depēd of thꝭ
vnity vnder one heade: in one
faith, one baptim one hope, one
loue, in one ſpirit, al loking for
one rewarde vnder one heade
chriſt in heauē: therfore all we
(whether good or bad & not errīg
in ye faith) are of thꝭ church
which thē cōſequētly herby appereth
to be knowen. Now for
the profe of al theſe: for ye firſt,
there is one chriſt (ephe. i) whō
God the father ordeined to be
head ouer al his church which
is his bodi miſtical, Peter and
his ſucceſſours being immediate
vicars therof as is fulli declared
in this boke. For the ſecond,
we al are knit in thunity

one faith (i. co. i) ſaie al one thīg
& let ther be no ſciſme amōges
you: for ye are al one (gal. iii) yt
is to ſay, in ye faith of chriſt. For
ye third we al agre in thuniti of
one bapti. (Vnū baptiſmacte.
eph. 4) & that cōcernīg the matter
of bap. concerning ye maner
& forme of bap. & concerninge
alſo the effect & profyt of bap.

Go and teache al nacions baptyſing

is baptiſed ſhall be ſaued. &c.
For the fourthe ye are all
called (Epheſians the .iiii.)

vnto one hope of your vocatiō
                     Hoc eſt in vnā rē ſperatā que eſt
effectus vocationis veſtre. For ye
v, kepe ſtil one charity (phi. ii)
being al of one minde as the apoſtels
were (Actes the .iiii.) &
as we are al being the church
counted as one lofe (i. cor. x) or
one bodye. For as one lofe is
made of manye graines & one
bodye of many members ſo is
the church compacte of manye
faithfull people knit together
in charity. For ye ſixte, i. cor. xii.
the giftes of grace are many,
but al cōmeth of one holye ſpirite.
Be ye therfore carefull
(ephe. iiii) to kepe the vnitye of
this ſpirit, ſeing yt as one ſoule
doth quickē & noriſhe al members
of the natural bodye. So
doth one ſpirit quickē, & noriſh

al the faithfull mēbres of chriſtes
bodi miſtical. For the laſt,
mat. 20. We loke al for one peny
to be geuen of god whyche is
our onely one head (Iohels. i)
rewarder of all, we being then
all brought into one ſhepecote
of hym our onelye one ſhepeherde
and paſtour. By this
aunſwere ye maye fullye perceyue
the palpable darkeneſſe
wherein theſe heretikes blindlye
do walke which obſtinately
holde that the church is vnknowen,
and that none be of
it but ſuch as be all pure without
ſpotte, and that the
ſmaller number is
euer the better

            ¶The concluſion.
            
               WE maye perceyue
now hereby (ientill
reader) howe
weake & feble all
the obiectiōs are,
which be commonlye made agaynſt
the Popes authoritye.
We may perceyue the long cō
               tinuance
of it, euen from Peters
time hitherto, with ſufficient
profes of the ſame. We
may perceyue alſo that thonly
occaſion of all hereſies and other
miſchiefes whiche haue
bene here in Englande, and
cauſed miſerable ſciſmes amō
               geſt
vs in the late miſerable yeres,
was the forſakynge of
the heade of the churche and
breakynge the vnity therof.
            
               
We perceyue moreouer that ye
only cauſe of leauinge and forſakyng
hym, was ſinne aduoutrye
pride and auaryce: but the
cauſe being nought, how could
the effecte be good? Yea howe
nought euil and wicked, the effect
hath bene, and what miſery.
we haue both felt and ſuffered,
ſtill worſe and worſe as
wel bodily as ghoſtlye euerye
good man doth playnly ſe. We
perceiue alſo (by example now
to ſpeake) that lyke as yf ye
take a clue of yearne, and let
the top thred be faſt knit, toſſe,
tipe, and playe at the ball with
it, ſo longe as the toppe threde
breaketh not, all holdeth faſte
together: but breake ones the

toppe threede, and then playe
with it, toſſe it vp & downe, &
all will ſone come to nought: euen
ſo it hath chaunſed here in
England with chriſtes true religiō,
after that we ones brake
the toppe threde. Experience
hereby hathe taught vs, that
amonges chriſten mē nothing
is ſo ſore to be feared as to be
deuided from the vnity of chriſtes
churche, as all they be
whyche forſake the head therof.
            In vnity peace and concord
all thynges do floryſſhe and
proſper: but through diuiſyon
and ſchiſme, what euell commeth
not?li. 9. trip. c

            And that cauſed the holye emperour
Theodoſius ſo greatlye

to laboure for vnytye amongeſt
Chriſtes flocke.
Which thinge nowe earneſtly
pondered and throughlye weped,
let vs with all dylygence,
wyth all ſtudye and prayer endeuoure
our ſelues to kepe vs
in the vnitie of chriſtes church,
and to kepe vp the charet that
it fall no more to the grounde.
Let vs mooſte humblye obey
vnto Peter and his ſucceſſors,
as vnto the heade and chieffe
ſtone (ſayeth Saincte Hierrome)
whervpon Chriſte dyd
builde his churche: whereunto
who ſo euer is not vnyte
and knitte, is but a rotton and
putryfyed bowe, and perteyneth
nothynge to thys ſpirituall
buyldynge of Chriſte: but
ſhall vtterlye periſhe.
            
               
Let vs therefore flee here vnto
as to the chieffe refuge and
holye ancoure in all doubtes:
knowynge that Chriſte prayd
for Peter, that hys fayth ſhold
neuer fail, but yt the truth ſhold
euer ſtill contynue in hys ſee,
ſo that hys ſhyppe ſhoulde neuer
drowne.
            The fayth is quite exyled frō
thoſe churches, whych ſchiſmaticallye
haue diuided them ſelues
from Peters ſee: their ſhippes
be drowned, but Peters
ſhyppe ſhall neuer drowne.
Let vs therefore (for Ieſus
ſake) nowe beynge in hys ſhip
agayne, continue ſtyll therein,
kepynge all in one (as Paule
wylleth vs) and ſaye all one
thynge, ſufferynge no Schiſme
to be amongeſte vs.
            
               
but with al feare and reuerēce
cōtinuing here in, let eueri one
medle with his owne office, &
doe his owne duty ſimply and
warely, euer obeing (as paule
biddeth) our rulers, both ſpiritual
and temporal namlye the
head of all, Peters ſucceſſour.
And then ſhal we perceue how
good and ioyful a thing it is to
continue as brethren all in on.

or publicans.Mat. 18. And note
here, yt as Moyſes chere was
then, ſo is thappoſtolical ſeate
now:Num. 16. As god plaged then Dathan
Chore and Abiron for
ſciſme, ſo hath he done now in
the new lawe, and wil doe ſtil,
except we amende. And as he
caſt Saul fourth of his kingdome,

and ſtroke Ozias the
kyng with lepreſie, for peruerting
his ordor, wherby the vnitie
of his houſe was kepte: So
hath he of late dayes iuſtly plaged
many amonge vs: and wil
do to thende all ſuche as wyll
not mekelye do penaunce & amend
quite forſakīg al ſciſme,
with whom hereſie is euer ioyned:

there is peace and concord.
Here vnto therfore Peter him

ſelfe exhorteth vs, biddinge all
be of one mynde:1. pet. 3. and Saynte
Paule alſo,Roma. 15. God graunt you
(ſaieth he) to be of one mynde
together after the example of
Ieſus Chriſt, that ye all agreynge
together maye wyth one
mouthe praiſe hym: wyth one
mouth ſaith he, one conſent of
manye in God is called wyth
one mouth: but bycauſe a conſente

therfore he addeth ſecūdū Ieſū

the exāple & doctrine of Ieſus
Chriſt.Phil. 2. Like exhortaciō Paule
hath to the Corin. & to ye Philip.

name of our lord Ieſus chriſt
yt ye al ſpeake one thing,1. Cor. 1. & that
there be no diſſētiō amōg you,1. corin. 3.

his father that his Diſciples
might be all one: addinge further
that when they were gathered
together in one in his

And ſo in thactes they getheringe
them ſelues together in
one,Act. 2. wt one accorde, in prayer,
the place moued where they
ſtode, and they all were repleneſſhed
with tholy ghoſt. And
then there was one heart, one
mynd,Act. 4. and one wyl of all that
did beleue. This vnitye tholye
ghoſte had worked amongeſt
them cōming downe inlikenes
of firye tonges, againſt ye colde
poyſon and enuious intiſemēt
of the deuil.Gene. 11. In babilon was ye
               
confuſion, and diuiſion of one
tonge into many, in token that
the deuil author of ſediciō doth
euer deuide a ſūder,Lumē graciae 
                     •
                  oēs idem aſſerere facit ſ. Dion. but tholye
ghoſt as author of vnity & concorde
at his cōminge made a
vnion of all tonges in to one.
See therfore (ſaith.Oratione. 
                     •

that cōmeth by tholy ghoſte, &
the ſchiſme & diuiſion yt cōmeth
through the deuil. At the buildinge
in babilon al their tōges
coulde not make one tonge to
agre with an other, but here
one tonge made al to agree:Act. 2. ſo
that one man ſpeakinge one
language in one tonge was
vnderſtande of all nations.

Oh howe pleaſaunt
and comfortable a thinge is it
for gods people to continue together

in vnity?Ho. de inconprehenſibili dei natu. Holy Chriſoſtome
after he hathe declared
thunitie obſerued amongeſt ye
angels, wt ſettinge forth theyr
laudinge and prayſing of god,
ſayth thus, do ye ſee, what reuerence,
what obſeruaunce,
what ordre the āgels do kepe,
and what negligence, what cō
               tempt,
and diſordre, is among
vs? The angels do laude and
honour god in vnitye and concorde
together, but wycked
men do ſet all at noughte, do
ſearche and ſtryue together,
and that aboue theyr reache,
euer breakynge the godlye vnitye.
            Al thinges (ſaith he) ſaue onelye
man do obſerue the vnitye
and euer kepe ordre.
            The Aungelles kepe theyr

ordre in this vnitye, ſo do the
ſonne, the moone, and the reſt
of the planettes kepe theyr ordre:
the ſtarres, the elementes,
the foules of thayer, the fiſhes
in the ſea, the beaſtes on the
earth euer ſtill kepe their ordre,
onely manne wyll ſtyll be
out of ordre.
            And this is the cauſe (ſaythe
he) whye the vnitye is broken
and not kepte amonge vs.
            And marke here (ſayth he further)
that lyke as in muſycke
when tharmony in ſtringes, pipes,
and tunes, do well agree
together, then is ther ſwet
and pleaſaunt melody, and els it is
grief and no pleaſure to here:
euē ſo it is wt vs the membres
of Chriſtes miſticall bodye.
            
               
If we rede theſe natural examples
which moue to vnity, and
conſider alſo beſide theſe, that
euerye countrey hath a ſundry
gyfte of god, whych other coū
               tres
doe lacke: as ſome haue
ſilkes and veluettes, ſome ſpytes,
ſome wynes, ſome leade,
woole, tinne, Irne, wadde, mather.
&c. and all this for a ciuel
vnitye, and honeſt natural order
to be had and kepte amongeſt
the people, whom god did
creat to liue in one as aſſociate
together (homo eſt ſociale animal)
knowing yt as thethnicke
affirmeth,Concordia paruaeres creſcunt, diſcordia dilabuntur & magnae. Sal. with concorde peace
and vnitye all thinges floriſh
and increaſe, but with diſcorde
ſtriffe and contention al commeth
ſone to ruine and deſtruction.
Oh good Lorde when

we rede or here theſe or ſuche
lyke natural perſwaſions inſtitute
euen by god, according
to oure firſte generation and
birthe, mouinge ſo greatlye to
vnitye what ſhal we then coniecture
or ſay, to the ſupernatural
vniti which ought to be obſerued
and kepte amonge vs
now beinge regenerate and
newly borne againe in Chriſt?
we beinge all of one religion,
all through one regeneracion
grafte in Chriſt, euerye one as
a member of the ſame body hauing
his peculier office to maintayne
this vnitye with all? we
ought then all beinge of one
mynde to be ioyned faſt in one
as members together, hauing
euery one his office vnder one
head appoynted: ſeing one baptime

hathe regenerate vs all
vnto god, and that we haue al
one father in heauen, all brethren
by profeſſion of Chriſtes
true religion, all appointed to
receiue one rewarde of inmortalitye,
euerye one, one penye
for our daye laboringe in the
vineyarde. And for this, the
membres of theſe oure corruptible
bodies doe ſuccoure euerye
one, one another: and in
caſe anye thinge doe chaunce
to one of them, whether it be
good or bad, euerye one of the
other taketh it as their owne.
What ſhall we ſaye then here
in? If euerye mēber haue nede
of other, if euerye member be
member to all other, and doe
miniſter in his office to al: if euerye
membre do helpe other,

and neuer a mēber do grudge
at others preeminence: if
thande do miniſter, the mouth
doe eate, the ſtomake receiue
the feete carye the woole. &c.
Why ſhould not we then, being
al membres of Chriſtes bodye
kepe the ſame cōformity to the
mayntenaunce of this vnitye
wherof now I ſpeke? we ſe yt ī
a material buyldyng one ſtone
ſerueth in one place, which can
not ſerue in an other, and will
not we ſe that amonges the lyuelye
ſtones of Chriſtes ſpiritual
houſe the ſame conformitye
ought euer to be kept, and
al for the defēſe of this vnitie?
knowing that there is but one
hope, one faith, one baptim, on
lorde, and one God, rewarder
of all that kepe the vnitye as

they oughte to doe? whyche
thynge yf all Chriſten men ſtil
had earneſtlye obſerued, then
no doubt the Turke and other
infidels had not ſo preuayled
agaynſt chriſtendome as they
haue done within theſe few. C.
