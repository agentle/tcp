            ¶ To the Christian Reader.
            IT shall not be necessary for me (most louing brethren) to shewe anye causes for mine own excuse why I haue attempted the setting forth of this little Catechisme, as though I had rashly aduentured aboue that was méete, to set forth any thing to be so common by my priuate aduise: Or as though I had presumed aboue mine abilitye to become so general a teacher, hauing my self so meane vnderstandyng. For in these daies in which there is so great licentiousnes of printyng bookes, as in déede it maketh vs all the worse, who can blame it that hath any taste or sauer of goodnes, be it neuer so simple, if it had no other fruite, yet this is great and plentyfull, that in reading it we shoulde keepe our eyes from much godles and childish vanitie, that hath now blotted so many papers. We sée it all, and we mourne for griefe, so many as in spirite and truth do loue the Lord. What multitude of bookes, full of all synne and abomination, haue nowe filled the world? No thing so childish, nothing so vaine, nothing so wanton, nothyng so ydle, whych is not both boldly printed, and plausibly taken. So that herein we haue fulfilled the wickednes of our forefathers, & ouertaken them in theyr syns.

They had their spiritual enchauntmentes, in which they were bewytched, Beuis of Hampton, Guy of Warwike, Arthur of the round table, Huon of Burdeaux, Oliuer of the Castle, the foure sonnes of Amond, and a great many other of such childish follye. And yet more vanitie then these, the witles deuices of Gargantua, Howleglas, Esop, Robyn Hoode, Adam Bel, Frier Rushe, the Fooles of Gotham, and a thousand such other. And yet of all the residue the most dronken imaginations, with which they so defiled their Festiual and high holydaies, their Legendawry, theyr Saintes lyues, their tales of Robyn Goodfellow, and of manye other Spirites, which Satan had made, Hell had printed, and were warranted vnto sale vnder the Popes priuiledge, to kindle in mens hartes the sparkes of superstition, that at last it might flame out into the fire of Purgatorie. These were in the former daies the subtile sleightes of Satan to occupye Christian wyts in Heathen fansies. And we as men that can not learne wisedom by anye examples to kéepe our selues from harme, but as though the wickednes of our forefathers were not yet full, we wyll make vp their measure, and set vp Shrines to the woord of God, and the wrytinges of all hys Saintes, which our forefathers had cast out

of all honor, that their own dreames and illusions might be had in price. To thys purpose I trow we haue multiplied for our selues so many new delightes that we might iustefy the idolatrous superstitiō of the elder world. To this purpose we haue printed vs many bawdy songes (I am lothe to vse such a lothsome woord, saue that it is not fyt inough for so vile endeuours,) to this purpose we haue gotten our Songes & Sonets, our Pallaces of pleasure, our vnchaste Fables and Tragedies, and such lyke Sorceries, moe then any man may recken. Yea some haue ben so impudent, as new borne Moabites, which wallow in their own vomit, and haue not bene ashamed to entitle their bookes, The Court of Venus, The Castle of Loue, and manye such other as shamelesse as these. O that there were among vs some zealous Ephesians, that Act. 19. 29. bookes of so great vanity might be burned vp. The spirite of God wrought in them so mightely, that they contemned the price of so great iniquitie, in one Citie, and at one fire they brought together the bookes valued to twoo thousand markes, and burnt them al at once. O happy light & cleare as the Sun beames, if we might sée the lyke in London, that the chiefe streete might be sanctified with so holy sacrifice. The place it selfe doth craue it, and

holdeth vp a gorgeous Idoll, a fyt stake for so good a fire. O Lord thou art able to woorke what thou wylt, let vs sée this day that Iacob may reioyce, and Israel may be glad. So recompence thine enemies, as they haue recompenced thée. Of old they Iere. 36. 23 burnt the wrytings of thy Prophets, and in their ages following they departed not from the synnes of their fathers, but gaue the An. dom. 290. sub Dioclesianus, et anno. 1559 sub Paulo. 4. holy labours of thy Saintes vnto ashes, nowe let vs sée the iust recompence of anger, and make our good Rulers the instruments to execute thy iudgementes. We haue now long inough played with our own fansies, Lord rayse vp agayne thy word into honour, that our eyes may be occupied in holy readinges.
            And you deare Brethren that are yet in battail to fight against Satan, pray and cease not, that God alone maye be exalted in our daies, that Satan may be troden vnder foote, and that the woord of God, the strong weapen of our strife, may be geuen into the handes of all, that their lyfe may be in safetie. And be perswaded of this, that there is no one thyng more enemy to the woord of God, then these vaine and synfull imaginations of our owne vnbridled wits, which haue now filled so many volumes. And therefore I trust I can deserue no blame to aduenture the setting out

of this short enstruction, sithe my desire is only to aduance Gods glory, and edefie hys poore Church, that is yet so couered in darke ignorance: when so many haue found leaue to spread abroad their labours, that haue no other pleasure then offyn and wyckednes.
            Now for that that I haue taken vpon mee to set forth vnto many this enstruction, beare with me, I beseche you, and praye vnto God that we may all together hold the humblenes of mynde that was in Christ Iesu, that we be not wise in our own conceits, nor thincke of our selues aboue ye which is conuenient, but acknowledging the blindnes of our hart, and the ignorance in which we are borne, we may say with the most happy Apostle, we haue nothing that we haue not receiued. And of many other I do willyngly professe it, I am the least, but by the grace of God I am that I am, and I trust hys grace is not in vayne in me. But this that I here present vnto the Church of God, I haue not done it alone: but another faithfull labourer in the woorke of the Lord, and a good brother in Christ Iesu, whom God hath endued with great knowledge, and blessed with much vnderstanding, he hath taken the greatest paine, and the greatest fruit must grow of his labours. So that I haue not aduentured of my selfe, but haue onely bene an

helper of an other mans labour. And the cause yt hath mooued vs both is suche, as hath made the Children of God euen to faynt in their mourning, vntil they shall sée the great mercies of God to take awaye the cause of their griefe. We sée the great ignorance in which the people are euery wher couered, the cloudes of darknes, more then the darknes of Aegypt, haue so ouer shadowed them, that the light of the Gospel of the glorye of Christ, who is the Image of God, it doth hardlye or not at all shine in their vnbeleuing hartes.
            Scarce one of a great many can giue an accompt of their faith, yet S. Peter requireth it of 3. Pet. 4. 13 euery Christian. A very few haue tasted the beginninges of the Gospel of Christ, and yet S. Paule biddeth that the word dwel plentifulfully Col. 3. 16. in eche one of our hartes. The Apostle blameth the ignoraunce of the people, who haue learned yet no further, then repentance from dead workes, and the first enstructions of the faith toward God: But O Lord, howe Heb. 6. 1. many thousands of vs, of fayth and of true repentaunce can say nothyng? The Prophet speaketh of the kyngdome of Christ, that in those daies the earth should be ful of the know Esa. 11. 19 ledge of the Lord, as the waters that do couer the sea: where is now that blessed spirite of vnderstandyng to be poored vpon vs? And

wher is this riches of the knowledge of God? Are not rather the multitude of our brethren clothed with darknes, so that they grope in their wayes as at midnight, & know nothing of the way of lyfe? We pray dayly according as we are taught, Let thy kingdome come, if we speake not like the Parets, in woordes without vnderstanding, then this is our meaning: let thy spirite beare rule in our hartes, and the knowledge of thy woorde lighten the eyes of our mynde. And what do we then els but dally with the Lord, if we pray styll for knowledge, and yet sleepe stil in ignorance
                  •
                Then thys is (louing Brethren) a good excuse for our boldnes, if in so great necessitye, according to our talentes, we séeke to be profitable vnto many.
            If any thinke that there are already sufficiently set forth many Catechismes, I do easely graunt it, but they are not sufficiently learned, neither yet can be. For it was necessary in the best and most godlye of these labours, whilest the Christian faith is plainly taught, to edifiyng of the simple, and conuincing of the aduersary, that the faithful teacher should vse moe wordes, then can be caried in mynde of the ignorant man. And therefore I thought itgood as briefly as I could, to comprehende the effect of all, that the begynninges beyng

made playne, and easely printed in memory, we might enter into reasoning and disputation with our selues, enstructing one another, and helping one an other, that we might haue the more fruit in the lōger labours of others, but most of all that we might be encouraged to the most holy and liuely woord of God, to drinke wyth continuall desire of the fruitfull spring, euen vntyll the water of lyfe do flow vp in our hartes vnto euerlastyng gladnes, & the day starre do arise in our hartes, which may lighten our mindes in to the knowledge of the God of glory.
            There is nothyng remayning more why this labour should be misliked, except anye man would thinke, that euery Congregation had a sufficient Pastor to instruct those that were ignorant, so that they should not néede any straunge Teacher: God graunt that in time to come this maye be found true. But yet we are farre from it, euen as light from darknes, or death from life, or as knowledge and vnderstanding is from insensible blyndnes. O that we had eyes to see so great miserie: For sure it may not wel be iustified, that in so cleare light of the woorde, as God hath made now to shine vpon vs, that there was euer nation which had so ignorant Ministers We maye here in compare with the man of

synne him selfe. I do not knowe that in the midst of all hys abominations there was a more lothsome sight of that idolatrous priesthood, then we haue set vp among our selues, to be fellow labourers among vs in the Gospell. For what though they excéeded in loosnes of life? Yet their darke and barbarous religion was so thicke a cloude spread ouer their maners, that the fulnes of their lynnes was not easely seue: But we haue the light that hath made althinges manyfest, and the Sunne hath shined that hath disclosed iniquitie, so that there hath not bene among vs any popish Priest so dronken, nor any alehouse Chaplen at such a perpetuall truce with hys drinking pots, that hath possibly purchased so much discredite to his belly God, and kitchin faith, as our dum Dogs and guides, do dayly multiply against the God of Israel, and the faith of his anointed our onely God and Sauiour. It gréeneth me to remember, and lotheth me much more to rehearse the estate of the ministration into whych we are fallen. We haue good time now to complayne wyth the Prophet, like people, like Priest. Euen Esa. 44. 2 the same coueringes of Israel that shadowed then their glory, they haue spread thē selues agayne as the heauens, & are come ouer our head in so great a tempest of blindnes & ignorance,

that they haue shaken the foundations of all our comfort.
            We saw in deede Halcionios dies, the glad and pleasant daies in which our hope shined, when first our happy gouernment turned away our sorrowes, brake the yoke of Antitichrist, deliuered vs from the power of darknes, and caryed vs among the Saints of God into the kingdome of light. But our hope hath since suffered a great Eclipse, from the fulnes of her beutie, (such hath bene the malice of Satan.) He attempted agaynst vs euen at the first his most pestilent practise, and hath brought accordinglye hys purpose to effect. When God had turned the wyl of the Magistrate, Deut. 1. 15 and enclined his eare to vnderstāding: when he had geuen vnto him courage to scatter Exo. 18. 21 the enemies of his truth, and planted true feare in his hart to establish his Gospel: then the subtile Serpent which had turned all his deuices hether, he bent his violence, and thys counsell pleased hym best: To corrupt the Priesthoode, who should instruct the Prince Nu. 27. 21 by Vrim and Thumim, that if thus he might darken the light of the people, it might be the more easy to leade them out of the way.
            Then he entred againe, and with more successe into hys first assaultes, wherewyth he tempted once our sauiour Christ: He robbed

the Minister of his blessed hope in the prouidence of God, and made him seeke the wayes ful of vile shame, to get his bread. He hanged before his eyes an other veale of pompe and vanitie, that he could not with open countenance see Christ, but folowed the present plea sures that better liked him. And so first woū
               ding the head, the infection hath growen since into the other partes of the body, that now al most there is nothyng but woundes & swelling, and sores full of corruption. Looke wher we wyl among the people of the Lord, & how hardly shall we funde the dwellyng place of the godly Pastour.
            If Ieremie were now aliue, he would take Iere. 9. 1. vp againe his old complaintes: O that myne head werefull of water, and mine eyes a fountaine of teares, that I might weepe day and night for the slayne of the daughter of my people. For looke what agrement hath righteousnes with vnrighteousnes, and what fellowship hath light with darknes, what concord Christ with Belial, or what part the beleuer with the Infidel: the same societie is betwene a great number of our English Parsons and Uicars, with the true Preachers & Ministers of the Gospell. Your selues good Christian Readers make the comparison, and be your own Iudges, what cause we haue to

complaine. The true Minister is the salt of the earth, to drye vp corrupt and noysome humors, Mat. 5. 13. and to preserue the substance pure, that the world may be offered vp a swete sacrifice vnto God: But our Uicars and Curates, we haue some of them yet of the old morowmas Priestes, whose salt is vnsauerie with much popish leauen, that there is no taste in them of the Gospell of Christ. Most certaine it is, that the popish Priesthoode is no calling for a Minister of the Gospell: And therefore they that haue not openly forsaken that, and haue geuen a new promise vnto Christ, they may well haue the lyuing, but they cannot be the persons whom God hath called, nor yet the salt to season his elect and chosen.
            The true Minister is the light of the world, Mat. 5. 14 which holdeth foorth the Gospell of Christ in his hand as a lanterne to lighten the steps of a great number, how to walke vnto Christ: but what daylight I beseche you, shineth in the Ministers of our making? They are better séene in their seueral occupations, then in the knowledge of the word, which they should dispence vnto others. The true Minister is a fisher of men, by whom the parish is stirred vp to all loue, to God first, and then mutually one to another: but the Parsons nowe haue either nets so broken, or their baytes so yll,

that we sée the effect is, no gatheryng together, but a wofull dispersion both of Priest & people. How many examples do we sée of a continual dissipation in sutes and controuersies? the Parson against the Uicar, the Uicar against the Parson, the Parish against both, and one against another, and al for the belly. Among whō neither people, Parson, Curate, Uicar, one nor other hath anye care for the Gospel of Christ. As the Lord doth lyue, this is no other fishing, but to suffer that roaryng Lyon to catch al by his enchauntmentes, that he may haue large pasture in the Church of God. The true Minister is the eye of the body: Mat. 6. 22 Mat. 9. 38 Mat. 22. 3 Ma. 23. 34. the woorkeman in the haruest: the Messenger that calleth vnto the Mariage: the Prophet that telleth the wyl of the Lord: the wyse man that teacheth to discerne betwene good and euyll: the Scribe that doth expound Ma. 25. 16 Lu. 24. 48 1. Cor. 4. 1 the law: the Seruant that occupieth his Maisters talentes vnto gayne: the Wytnes that beareth testimony of Christ to all people: the Mathew. 24. 45. Ro. 15. 16. dispensers of the misteries of God: the Stew ard that geueth meate in due time, vnto the residue of the houshold: the Sacrificer of the Gospel of God, to make the oblation of hys flocke acceptable: the Minister by whom the 1. Cor. 3. 5 people doo beleue: the Labourers of God to tyll hys husbandrye, and make vp his buylding: 1. Cor. 3. 9
               
the Shepheard to féede the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his blood. Ac. 20. 28 But alas and wo for vs, if we can sée our sorrow, what one of these excellent vertues shineth in our Pastors? I speake the truth, and God in his good time wyll geue vs eyes to sée his iudgementes. Scarce one Parish of an hundred hath found such a Minister, or scarce two and thrée in a Shéere whom God hath so blessed. If S. Paule say true, or if the voyce of God be fearfull in our eares, that we cannot beleue except we heare, and we cannot Ro. 10. 14 heare wythout a Preacher: where is our glory that we are the people of the Lord? Or where is our reioycing that the Gospell is amongest vs? Were it not that the woorkes of the Lord preached dayly vnto vs, and their voyce had come into our eares, as fully as to Psal. 19. 5. our forefathers, euen in the strongest of our people, it would make their faith to wauer.
            For about vs in our Countrie, wher dwelleth that Minister, or where is his name, that shall strengthen the weake harted, and rayse them vp in hope? He must faith S. Paule, he must be apt to teache that is made Minister: but we haue made the old saying true, Oportet 
               
                  
                     •
                   Tim. 32 
               non habet locum, they are we may say, they are more meete for the plow, that dwell in the personage. Say the Apostle what he

say wyll, he must or 
                  •
               e must not, he shall be made Minister now that pleaseth the maker.
            Euen thus it is, both high and low, as many as God hath sealed with a god spirite, they complayne of it. They say all with Ieremy: 
               Iere. 2. 8. The Priestes say not, where is the Lord? and they that should minister the law, they know nothing. The men among vs that would be our leaders, they may say as of olde time, I wyl prophecie vnto thee of wyne, & of strong Mich. 2. 
                     ••
                  
                drinke, but of the lawe and the testimonies they can no skil. So heauy is the hand of our God ouer our synnes, vntyl we be amended. He hath broken hys two staues of happy féeding, Zech. ii. 13 both bewty and bandes, and geuen in stéede of them the instrumentes of a foolyshe Shepheard, and hath raysed vs vp Pastours which looke not for the thinges that are lost, nor seeke the tender Lambes, nor heale that that is hurt, nor féede that that standeth vp. 2. Chroni. 15. 3. And therfore we may boldly say, God himself being our warrāt, that the Israel of the Lord is without his Pastour.
            But some perhaps wyll thincke this complaint to be gréeuous, God hath not delt thus with vs, but rather hath multiplied a great manye of learned and godly Ministers vnto vs, euen now in great aboundance, as in any age before vs: Most certainly true it is, that

God hath raysed vp in our dayes men of singuler hope, full of excellent giftes, whose vertues in yong yeares hath shined farre aboue the gray heares of their forefathers. Would God we were halfe thankfull inough for so manyfolde blessinges. The ioy of the whole earth, and the gladnes of al the world, that is the blessed hope of the Gospel, it shineth not a litle, euen in their countenances The Lord encrease them a thousand thousand fold, and geue them double his spirit, that they may be greater then all their enemies, & abyde faithfull euen vnto death: that through them the Prince may reioyce, the Magistrate maye be glad, their fellowes may be encouraged, yt peo ple may be taught, al may haue hope, syn may be abolished, Idolatrye rooted out, Antichrist ouerthrowen, Satan troden downe, Hel may be confoūded, the Gospel may encrease, righteousnes maye shine, and God may haue the glory. This desire is the fruite of our lyse, and ther is not in the world a better portion: this we haue chosen, and in this we wil dwel, vntyl the fulnes of tyme, that we shall say in our course: Lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace.
            
            But we haue here not a litle feare, and we sée the stumbling blockes, that haue made our wayes daungerous. True it is many men

ar greatly to be beloued, but this is as true: there is none so good but Sathan wyll seeke to fift him. Noe, Lot, Aaron, Miriam Samson, Dauid, Martha, Mary, men and women of most excellēt vertue, and such as the world was not worthy of: and yet not one of these whom Satan wounded not, yea almost vnto death. The most glorious of all men subiect vnto synne, was Adam him selfe, and yet he was throwne downe into great confusion. So that the Saintes of God (for so I trust I may call them, because of their great 
                  〈◊〉
               ) the Saintes I say, that God hath sent vnto vs, they haue great cause to feare, 
                  •
                to say wyth Paule, VVho seemeth to stand, let him take heede he fall not. Sure they are 
                  •
               f continual assaultes, and euen at this present one aboue other shaketh all their faith.
            Satan hath so rent a sunder the glorye of our Ministerie, that fleshe and bloud is not halfe willing to beare the shame of the world that goeth after it. He hath spoyled it of the due reward: of al authoritie: of al obedience: loue, reuerence & honor that man should gene vnto it. He hath layd vpon it much contempt, many reproches, great pouertie, intollerable bondage, so that though the calling be in deede the most precious inheritance vnder the sun, yet the glory is so darkned vnto mortal eyes,

that al Nobility is quite fled from it, the Gentlemen afraid to come vnto it, the riche man rather chuseth any other kinde of life, the men nest estate so hardly contented with it, that S. Paule him selfe can finde but a few folowers, that wyll cast away from them the clokes of 
                  
                     •
                  . Cor. 4. 2 shame, & not degenerate from the dignitye of their office. But God shall once geue agayne vnto his Ministerie beuty, in stéede of ashes, and ritch apparel in stéede of sackcloth, when he shal turne againe the captiuitie of Syon, & build vp the walles of the promised Ierusalē. In the meane season we wyll lyue in hope, and geue thankes vnto our God that hath brought vs hetherto. One other assault of Sathan hurteth as much as this: yea and so much the more, because it is couered with the cloke of benefite, & sheweth vs a saluing medicine against the former wound. For where as the Ministers liuing in most Churches is but smal, he hath found this remedy, that one man should haue many benefices: & whereas the reproche is not litle, but euen the name is ful of disdain, as to be called maister Parson, Maister Uicar, Syr Iohn, a parish Priest. &c. Agaynst this euyll he hath founde a remedye worse, and geuen liberty to al that wyll, to be Non residentes, to forsake their charge, to go where they wyl like masterles hounds, to fyl

the cōmon wealth with worse then any ydle or vagabond persons. Loe this is the vessel of poyson that Satan hath set a broch, & the cup of whoordome which the Pope hath begun of vnto al the world. This is the head and fountaine of all spirituall darknes: the roote from which the glory of Antichrist dyd first aryse: the filthy spring of al abominations, which by pestilēt encrease hath ouerslowed kingdomes with most shameful slauery: brought Princes into contempt: & set a vile person in the Monarchie of the world. And yet at thys day it doth so dull the spirites of many excellent mē, that their hartes are full of surfeting, and yet they foole not their disease, they wallow (as I said) in their own vomit, and yet they see not their shame. The hainousnes of this syune it is so displeasant in the sight of God, that he hath reuenged it wt one of his greatest plages in hardening the offenders hartes, that they should haue eyes to sée, & not sée, and eares to heare, & not heare, and hartes to vnderstand, and yet not vnderstand. For wher as in many thinges they heare the voyce of God, & follow humbly his calling, yet here they be deafe euen as the Serpent that stoppeth his eares, that he may not heare ye Charmer, charme he neuer so wisely. It is plaine y• the spirit speaketh: Be diligēt to know the state of thy flock, 
               Pro. 27. 23
               
               and take hede to thy heards, for riches remain not alway, nor the crowne from generatiō to generation. But yet the loue of riches, & gorgeous shew of honor hath so deceiued many, that in many yeares they sée not their flocke, nor care not at all in what pastures they be fed. So much in vayne it is that the Apostle speaketh vnto them: He that hath an office, let him attend on his office. The charge that Ro. 12. 7. 
               S. Paul geueth to the Ministers of the Church of Ephesus, is as plaine as may be spoken, yet they cānot vnderstād it: Take hede (saith he) Ac. 20. 28 
               vnto your selues, & to all the flock, of which the holy Ghost hath made you ouersears, to feede the Church of God which he hath purchased wich his own bloud. Oh that this precept were written in our harts with an yron pen, or a claw of Adamant, that we could neuer forget it. The often remēbrance that we haue bound our fayth vnto the spirit of God, that hee hath called vs for the instruction of his people, and that they are the price of the blood of Christ, would make vs at the last so to loue our duty, that the Sunne and Moone should be ashamed at the sound of a Nonresident, & the name of that parson should be odious vnto vs, y• would take vpon him a charge and looke not after it. The Prophet saith, that Ezec. 3. 18 &. 33. 8. if the Minister declare not the iudgements of

God against hym that synneth, the wycked man shal dye in hys syn, but his blood shall be required at the hands of the negligent watchman. And the Apostle to the Hebrewes, speaking of the faithful Minister, sayth that they Heb. 13. 17 watch ouer the soules of those that are committed vnto them, as they that shall geue accompt if any of them perish. If these two be sufficiēt witnes, that according to the law the truth should be estéemed, by their woord most certain it is that our negligent Pastors, who haue couered them selues as Salomon sayth, with thicke clay, and multiplyed their benefices, tyll they be many in number, they must needes thinke they haue an heauy accompt against the day of Christ. Neither gold nor siluer, nor the pride of honor shall be acceptable in stéede of the soules of their brethren. But so it is they are shut vp in blindnes, and God hath couered them with a spirit of slomber, & they are set down in the counsels of the mockers & despisers, which say in much securitye, where is the promise of his cōming? O curssed law of liberty that hath so dulled their spirit: And O bottomles pit and hel of whooredomes, out of which such a stincking sauour cōtinually breatheth of Pluralities, Totquots and al maner faculties, and dronken dregs of popish abominations.
            
               
O Lord God we beseche thée multiply thy spirit yet more vpon thine anoynted & chosen seruantes. Leade them into the mydst of thy Sanctuary, that they may drinke full of thy louing kindnes. And enrich them so far wyth all thy blessinges, that they may sée wyth thy Saintes what is the height, the breadth, the length, the deapth, and how vnsearchable is the ritches of thy glorye, that hast alone immortalitie, and dwellest in light, which shall shine for euer: That thy manyfolde mercies which thou hast multiplyed vnto them, may be made perfect in that fulnes of spirit, vntyl they shal say vnto themselues, euen with the zeale of that noble Prophet and King: I wyll not enter into the tabernacle of my house, nor get vp into my bed, I wil not suffer mine eyes 
               Psal. 132. 2 
               to sleepe, nor mine eyelyds to slumber, vntyl I haue caused this land which thou hast blessed to spue out the surfetings of this deadly poyson. O Lord God thou that art able, bryng this good thing to passe, let not our synnes seperate betwene vs and thy goodnes, but open thine eares vnto our praiers, and poure out thy compassions vpon vs, that we & our Rulers may all reioyce and syng together wyth thy Saintes in the Apocalips, Allelu-iah, saluation, Apo. 19. 2 and glory, & power be to thée O Lord our God, for true and righteous are thy iudgementes,

and thou hast condemned the great whoore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication. And therfore make vs say continuallye Allelu-iah, and her smoke let it ryse vp for euermore. Amen.
            
            Farewell good Christian Reader, and forget not thy deutie to blesse them wyth thy prayer, who haue blessed thée with libertye, and helpe them to the gloryous triumphe of the Gospel of Christ, who haue broken from thy neck the yoke of Antichrist, that they may long rule with righteousnes, with peace, and with ioy in the holy Ghost, whose gouernmēt hath made thée free from the bondage of Aegypt, from the spiritual Baby lou, from Pope and papacie, which shame hath shadowed, and shal at the last close it vp for euer.

             How shall we perfourme this dutie?
            
               Answer.
            
             To perfourme this duty, it is necessary to know vnto Rom. 3. 7. what death we by our selues ar subiect. Rom. 3. 7. What great saluatiō God of his free mercy hath geuen vnto vs throughe faith. And what Ro. 20. 4. thankfulnes we owe vnto him for our deliuerance.

               Iohn. 3. 4. Synne is the breach of the law of God, contayned in the ten commaundements: Rom. 6. 23 and the reward of this synne is eternal death.
            
               Question.
            
             Rehearse the ten Commaundements.
            
               Aunswer
            
             God spake these wordes & sayd. I am the Lord thy GOD whych Exod. 20. 1 brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, thou shalt haue none other Gods but me. &c.
            
               Question.
            
             What meaneth this commaundement, thou shalt haue none other Gods but me?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             The meaning of it is, yt I should acknowledge but Deut. 6. 4. one onely God, that I shoulde Deut. 6. 13 honour and feare him, that I should Deu. 10. 20 cleane vnto him: that I should not do Deut. 8. 19 after ye abominations of anye idolatrous people to worship stocks or stones: that I

               ould not Deut. 13. 1. harken to anye

false Prophetes, that teache their own fantasies, and not the woord of God: That I should not Deu 18.

                  5. seeke to any Sorcerers, Cōiurers, Witches, Soothsayers, Charmers, or any such: Deu. 12. 32 But that I should harken vnto Christ alone, and adde no thing to the woord which he hath spoken, but put all my trust in God alone, call vpon hym alone, feare him alone, and loue hym aboue all. All this is contayned in thys fyrst commaūdement, Thou shalt haue no other Gods but me.
            
               Question.
            
             What meaneth the second commaundement, that we shall not make anye granen Image?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             The meaning of this is, that we shoulde not thinke God to be lyke either Deut. 4. 15. Act. 17. 29. man or woman, or gold or syluer, or anye manner creature, that we should not woorshyp hym vnder the similitude of Leui. 26. 1. Sunne, Moone, or any other thyng what

soeuer it be, to how downe before it. But onely in Ioh. 4. 23. spirite and truth we must woorship God alone, and beside him no other: no Saint, no Angell, no creature. And that the worshipping of God alone, be not according to our fansies, Deu. 12. 32 but onely as hym selfe hath commaunded in hys woord. If in anye of these pointes we be faulty, we haue broken this second commaundement.
            
               Question.
            
             What meaneth the third commaundement, that we should not take the name of God in vayne?
            
               Aunswere.
            
             The meaning of it is, that we shoulde not sweare Leui. 19. 12 falselye, nor Eccles. 5, 1. rashly, nor in light matters, but with Deu 28. 58 feare and reuerence make mencion of the name of the Lorde our God in Iere. 4. 2. truth, in iudgement, and in righteousnes, to the glorye of God, or maintenance of brotherlye loue, in which causes we must sweare by the name of God Deut. 6. 13. alone,

neither by heauen, nor earth, neither by booke, Saint, nor Angell, Ierem. 5. 7 nor any creature. As for Masse, Crosse, Roode, or suche other, we ought so to detest suche manner Idols, that they shoulde not once be Exo. 23. 13 Psal. 16. 4. named among vs. But we should haue onely precious in our eies the Deu. 28. 58 glorious and fearfull name of the Lord our God. This is to obey this thirde commaundement.
            
               Question.
            
             What meaneth the fourth commaundement, Remember that thou keepe holye the Sabboth day?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             To keepe holye the sabboth day, is to come together, and with feare and reuerence to heare Act. 20. 7. the word of God preached vnto vs: to receaue his Sacramentes with fayth and with repentaunce: 1. Cori. 14. 18. to pray together with one heart and voyce: to shewe in outwarde doyng our inwarde sabboth, Num. 29. 7 that we rest from sinne and wickednes: that the spirit

of God dwelleth in vs, and wor keth in this lyfe the beginnyng of our euerlastyng rest. Thys is the fourth commaundement.
            
               Question.
            
             What meaneth the fift commaundement. Honor thy father and thy mother?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             To honour our Parentes, is to Leuit. 19. 3 feare, loue, obey, and reliefe them, or anye other that are vnto vs in their steede. As our Exo. 22. 28 Princes, and Rulers, our 1. The. 5. 12 Pastors and Ministers, our Maisters and Teachers, the Leui. 19. 32 aged and graye headed men: And also all maner of Superiors, that they may be honorable, they must put on a fatherly affection toward their Inferiours.
            
               Question.

             The Lorde here forbyddeth all kyllyng, fightyng, quarrelling, and Iohn. 3. 15. inward hatred, all Leui. 15. 17. desire of reuenge,

all reproches, and mockes of the dumme, the deafe, the lame, or anye other impotent: All Deut. 21. 1. hurt towarde our brother, and that we should do good vnto all, Mat. 5. 44. yea euen to our enemies, and loue one another as our selues.
            
               Question.

               Aunswer.
            
             In thys commaundement the Lorde forbyddeth all fornication, adultery, vncleannes, wantōnes, al Leui. 18. 22 vnnatural lusts, vnpure thoughts vnchaste behauiour, filthye talke, Deut. 22. 12 wanton apparell, ydle pastimes, glottony, dronkennes, Deut. 22. 21 houses of open whoredome, and whatsoeuer els may allure to vncleaues.
            
               Question.
            
             What meaneth the eight commaundement, Thou shalt not steale?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             The Lorde here forbyddeth all stealyng, both in deede & thought,

all 1. The. 4. 6 deceite, all Leui. 19. 11. lying and oppression, all Deu. 24. 14 withholding of the laborers hire, all Exo. 22. 21. vncourteousnes to the straunger, widow, and fatherles: all Deu. 10. 17 gyftes to peruert iudgement: all Leui. 19. 35. false measures, and couetousnes, and chargeth vs to be Pro. 27. 27. content wyth our callyng, and to lyue of our own. To obserue these thinges is not to steale.
            
               Question.
            
             What meaneth the ninth commaundement, Thou shalt beare no false wytnes against thy neighbour?
            
               Aunswer
            
             We are here forbidden to beare witnes in any vntruth, by othe or by word: we are forbiddē al Leui. 19. 16 flatterie and dissemblyng: all flaunderous and yll reportes, either our selues to speake them, or to heare them of others: nor in priuate offences we may not speake the truth to the hurt of our brothers good name, if by Mat. 18. 25. priuate admonitions he mai be won, but carefully & bold ly we must testefy al truth what so Leuit. 5. 1.
               
euer we knowe, to the furtherance of iustice.
            
               Question.
            
             What meaneth the tenth commaundement, Thou shalt not couet thy neyghbours house. &c?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             Here in plaine wordes God forbiddeth all inward desire, what so euer is vnlawful to be done, which desire is not onely synful when we consent vnto it, but Ro. 7. 7. the very motion is enemy vnto God, and banished from his presence. For it is vn possible those bodyes shoulde see God, which can nourish euyll concupiscence in them, euen as it is vn possible that corruption should 1. Cor. 15. 50. inherite incorruption, or that Ro. 8. 6. flesh and bloud in this similitude of old Adam shoulde inherite the kyngdome of God. So that by this commaūdement most clearely we may see the image of that man that plea seth God, euen such a one in whom is nothing impure, neither in wyll nor nature.
            
               Question.
            
            
               
Sithe these are Gods commaundements, I sée now most assuredly how there is no man that synneth not, tell me then what punishment is due vnto our synne.
            
               Aunswer.
            
             The Ro. 6. 23. reward of synne is death, not onely the present and transitory chaunge which we shal all taste of, but 
                  •
                
               Apo. 20. 6. &. 21. 8. second death, an other euerlasting death, the cursse of God, and his heauie wrath which hath no end, euerlasting condemnation, and the Mat 25. 41 Mark. 9. 44. paines of hel which abide for euer, not onelye in soule, whose worme dyeth not, but in body also, whose fyre shal neuer be quenched.
            
               Question.
            
             How say we then that God is merciful, if his anger be such as shall neuer be pacified?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             God is in dede a 2. Cor. 1. 3 God of all mercies, and father of all consolations, whose louyng kyndnesse hath no end, and in the great ritches of hys compassions he hath Eph. 3. 10. 1. Ioh. 3. 2 appointed to

make knowen the glory of his maiestie vnto hys children. But God is also iust & Rom. 2. 2 iudgeth righteously, and therfore to such as through infidelitie despise the ritches of hys goodnes, and disobey the woord of hys gloryous power, he hath appointed a iuste recompence of eternall death.
            
               Question.
            
             Now I know what is sinne, euen the breache of the lawe of GOD. And because of the excellencie of Gods maiesty whiche by sinne is offended, I see the greatnes of sinne, and how it deserueth eternall death, of which without exception by nature we are all gyltie. But tell me now, is there no punishment in this lyfe by which we may recompence our sinne?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             There is no sufficient recompence in the world: Ap. 18. 12. no goods nor multitude of ritches: Luc. 17. 10 no liberalitie to the poore: no whipping nor scourging, Col. 2. 23. nor hurt of thine own body: nothing that thou canst deuise

               Question.
            
             Nowe I know what sinne is, & to what death it hath condemned vs without all remedie in our selues, tell me now how we may be deliuered from the anger of God, and the paynes euerlasting?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             Marke and I will tel thee, pray vnto God to geue thee vnderstanding, and low in humilitie of spirit, I will declare the saluation of the Lorde, when we had sinned, and by sinne had Rom. 3.

Co. 5. 21 he must take this vpon him, & in

his owne righteousnes, he must be deliuered agayne from them.

             Tell me then where shall we finde such a Sauiour?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             The Lord lighten our eyes, that we may vnderstand the ritches of Col. 1. 29 his glorious misterie: the Lorde reueale his secret vnto vs: ye Lord make vs see with all his Saintes Eph. 3. 18 what is the height, the breadthe, the length, the depth, that we may syng vnto him the praises of al his mercies. This Sauior whom we seeke for, who for our synnes must Heb. 2. 9 taste of death, & yet in the power of his Rom. 1. 4 owne ryghteousnes must rise from death to life, he cannot be found Psa. 49. 7 Psa, 59. 1

which was forbydden them. Yea the Iude. 6. Angels of heauen when they kept not the first estate, but Ioh. 8. 44 fell away from the truth in which they were created, they could not beare vp their syn, but it 2. Pet. 2. 4 weyed them downe to hell, and bound them for euer in the chaines of darknes, so that in men and Angels ther is no hope. But God that is Ephe. 2. 4 ritche in mercies, and whose compassions haue no ende: Hee sent hys owne sonne in the Rom. 8. 3. similitude of synfull flesh, to be a redeemer, and to condemne synne in the flesh. So that this is the Sauiour sent into the world, euen Iesus Christ the righ teous, in Colo. 2. 9. whom the fulnes of the Godhead doth dwell bodely, that when there was no saluation in al creatures, GOD myght Cor. 5. 19 bee in Christ, and reconcile the world vn to him selfe.
            
               Question.
            
             If Christ through the power and vertue of his Godhead, did fulfill all righteousnes, and satisfie for our sinne, why then

was he also made man lyke vnto vs?

therfore that God myght be righteous in hys iudgement, Christe was mā like vnto vs, and so in our flesh Heb 9. 14 offered him selfe vnto death, as if he should haue sayd vnto hys father: Execute O God thy iudgements against man, & loe beholde me a perfect man, I will beare thē. And thus was our sauiour Christ perfect God, that he might be stronger then Sathan, and take synne away, and perfect man, that wee might haue part of his redemption Heb. 4. 15 who in all thinges was lyke vnto vs, synne onely excepted.

             Sithe Christ God and man hath thus payde the punishment of our sinnes, are we now all discharged before God?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             No, not euery one shall be saued by Christ, but they alone that doo beleue, & in a true fayth take hold of his mercies.

             Rehearse the Articles of this fayth.
            
               
               Aunswer. I beleue in God the father. &c.
            
               Question. Why makest thou mention of God the Father, God the Sonne, & God the holy Ghost, seing there is but one God?
            
               Aunswer. As the scripture teacheth vs most plainly that ther is but Deut. 4. 32 Ephe. 4. 6. one God, so likewyse it teacheth me that the sa
                  ••
                diuine substance is distinguished into three persons, into Mat. 28. 19 1. Iohn. 5. 7. the Father, the Sonne, and the holye Ghost. Whych three persons are one God Deut. 4. 12. Act. 17. 25. eternall, infinite, & most perfect in it selfe. And when God shall geue vs such eyes as shall be able to see the glorious Maiesty of his Godhead, then we shall haue also such heauenlye wysedome, as shall easely perceiue the distinction of the persōs. In the meane while we wyll beleue the truth of hys eternall woord, and hate and detest all contrary heresies.
            
               Question.
               
God graunt vnto vs al this sobrietie, but tel me now what is the effect of the Articles of thy fayth.
            
               Aunswer.
            
             First I beleue that God the Father, the maker of all thinges, Ephe. 3. 15. for his sonne Christes sake, is my Father, and therfore 1. Ioh. 4. 9. loueth me. Secondly, that God the Sonne was made 1. Tim. 2. 5. mā for me, & hath wrought for me what so euer was needefull to saluation. Thirdlye I beleue, that God the holy Gost Gala. 4. 6. dwelleth in my hart, as the 2. Cor. 1. 22 Ephe. 1. 14, seale of myne election, and perswadeth me that Christes benefites are all myne, & worketh in mee, Collo. 2. 11. that I dye vnto synne, and lyue vnto righteousnes.
            
               Question.
            
             What is it that thou callest the Catholike Church?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             The catholicke Churche is the whole company of the Heb. 11. 39. faythfull, which haue ben here to fore, or are now, or shall be to the latter ende, euen the whole fellowshyp of the

elect of God, I beleue ye God know eth them all, that he hath and wyll take them all into his glory.
            
               Question.
            
             What callest thou the cōmunion of saints?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             The cōmunion of Saintes is the society that we haue all with 1. Iohn. 1. 3. God through Christ Iesu, & the employing of all Gods benefits, both spiritual & temporal, to the mutual help and comfort one of an other, according to the measure offaith that we haue receiued. Thus I beleue the Saints of God wil do, Psal▪ 132.

               Question.
            
             What is it to beleue ye forgeuenes of syn?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             To beleue that the punishment of our synnes is fully payd by Iesus Christ, and therefore freely forgeuen vnto all that beleue in him.
            
               Question.
            
             What beleuest thou of the resurrection of the bodie?
            
               Aunswer.
            
            
               
I do beleue that after thys lyfe ended, Eccle. 12. 7. my soule shal go to God yt gaue it, & that my body shal rest in the graue, till the apointed tyme, & then I shal Iob. 19. 25. see God in my flesh, I my selfe shal see him, & myne owne eyés shall looke vpon hym, euen in this body made glorious, and with out al Phil. 3. 21. corruption, like vnto the body of Christ.
            
               Question.
            
             What is it thou sayest of life euerlasting?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             I beleue yt when God shal raise againe this body, & ioyne agayne in one my body & soule, that then my body shal be without al corruptiō, no more subiect to any chaūge, but that Death it selfe our last enemye shal be taken away, Cor 15. 54 & swallowed vp in victory, & I shall lyue, so that I shal neuer dye. God strengthen vs by his spirit in the inner man, yt we may be able to comprehēd with al his Saints, Eph. 3. 17 what is the lēgth,

the breadth, the height, the depth yt we may know the loue of Christ, and be filled with al fulnes of God.
            
               Question.
            
             The Lord increase this faith in vs: But tell me, haue we this faith in our owne power, to beleue if our selues wyll?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             No, but Ephe. 2. 8. faith is the gift of God, euen as our saluation likewyse is, & of our selues there is not one of vs that 1. Cor. 12. 3 cā so much as name the Lord Iesus, but Iohn 6. 6

               Question.
            
             How many Sacramentes are there?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             Two, Baptisme, and the Lordes Supper.
            
               Question.
            
             What strength of fayth haue we through our Baptisme?
            
               Aunswer.
            
            
               
Baptisme is a seale and token by whych God wyll haue me assured that Act. 22. 17. my syns are forgeuen me, and that my lyfe is acceptable in hys sight: That like as the water washeth away the filthines of our bodies, i. Pet. 3. 21. so our soules throughe the bloud of Christ are made cleane frō the corruption of syn: And as after our outward washing the bodye is more comely, so after our Baptisme the Rom. 6. 4. spirit of God woorketh in vs, that syn is dead in our mortall bodies, and we be rysen vp into newnes of lyfe. And in whom so euer Baptisme hath not this woorke, he may wel haue the name, but in dede he is no Christian.
            
               Question. 
            
            What strengthening of our fayth doo we finde in the vse of the Lordes Supper?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             The Supper of the Lorde doth strengthen my fayth, that I should not doubt, but as surely as I receiue

the bread and wyne into my body, to become of perfect substance with my flesh, 1. Co. 10. 16 so Christ hath giuen him selfe wholy to become mine, & nourisheth my soule to euerlasting lyfe, Rom. 4. 25 his death and passion is my delyuerance from syn, 2. Cor. 5. 21 his ryghteousnes is my iustification, euen so surelye confirmed vnto me, as if I my selfe had perfourmed in myne own body that most holy obedience vnto his father, which he alone fulfilled. Thus I receaue the Sacraments as signes and seales of the righteousnes that is by faith.
            
               Question.
            
             Sithe that this is then the doctrine of saluation, that when we were dead through syn, God of his great mercy sent his sōne to be made mā, and dye for our syns, and to fulfil all righteousnes, that he myght bring againe lyfe into the worlde, and so geue that life vnto euery one, whosoeuer should receiue the holy Ghost to beleue, that so we might be saued by fayth, who before were condemned by our workes: Wherto then now serueth our well doing,

or what auaileth it to do good works▪
            
            
               Aunswer.
            
             True it is, our good woorkes deserue nothing at Gods hand, for in his sight our good workes are not good, but all our ryghteousnes is like a defiled Esay. 64. 6. cloth. And were they neuer so many, yet by them Iob. 35. 7. God receiueth nothyng at our handes, Psal 
                     •
                  6. 2. and all our well doyng extendeth not vnto him, & therfore if we wyll aske any thing by workes, we must aske of them of whō we haue deserued it, at the hands of God we can aske nothing. And therfore as touching merite we wil let our workes alone. But we haue greater causes of well doyng, & which ought more to enforce vs, then eyther lyfe or death. Wee must doo well first, to shew our Collo. 3. 15. thankfull hartes to our Sauiour Christ, and to 1 Iohn. 5. 2. testefie our loue towardes hym, wyth keeping of his commaundementes. Againe, we ought to do wel, that our 1. Pet. 2. 12. example may call out brethren vnto

righteousnes, that they also may become with vs of the houshold of faith. But the greatest cause of all other is, that in our wel doing Mat. 5. 16. we set forth the glory of God, and hys holy name is praysed in our good workes. Thys ought to be so precious in our eyes, that ten thousand hels and heauēs should not so much mooue vs. This is the excellencie of vertue, that God in it is gloryfied, & thys is the great horrour and confusion of synne, that God in it is dishonoured.
            
               Question.
            
             Because that prayer is the especiall meanes which God wyl haue vs vse to encrease in faith, tel me what belongeth to true prayer?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             It is requisite in true praier fyrst that we pray Psa. 50. 13. onely to God: Iaco. 4. 3. Secondly, that we be inwardlye touched with the nede of the thing we aske: 2. Cori. 1. 20. Thirdlye, that we grounde our prayer vppon Gods promyse.

               Luk. 18. 2. Fourthly, yt we continue, though straight we obtaine not: Lastly, that we aske not what we wyll, but suche thinges as we are sure God hath commaunded vs to aske, lyke as we haue example in the Lordes prayer.
            
               Question.
            
             Rehearse the Lordes prayer.
            
               Aunswer.
            
             Our father which art in heauē. &c
            
               Question.
            
             What desirest thou in this praier?
            
               Aunswer.
            
             I desire of my heauenly Father, that his holy name may be glorified among vs, both in his excellent works, & in our liues: That he onely may be had in honour, & all other set asyde. Secondly, I desire that his kingdome may florish, that is, that his holy spirit may beare rule within vs, to all heauenly delights, and that his woord may haue the preeminence, to be our onely law of righteousnes, which we may all obey.

Thirdly, that we may willing ly resigne our selues to him, wythout all murmuring whatsoeuer he shal do. Fourthly, that he wyll minister of his great ritches, althings necessarye for our vocation. Fiftly, that our consciences maye be quiet, and we haue hope, that our synnes ar pardoned and blotted out of memory, euen as we pardon all whosoeuer haue offended vs. Lastlye, that God would strengthē vs with his holye spirite, and encrease our faith, that we maye ouercome the world, and quench the firye dartes of Satan, and so at the last be partakers of his glory.
            
               Question.
            
             Tell me now briefly the effect of all that thou hast confessed.
            
               Aunswer.
            
             By the ten commaundements I see my synne, and howe I haue deserued the wrath of God, & euerlasting damnation. From which because

I coulde not be delyuered by mine own strength, the holy Ghost bi the preaching of the Gospel hath wrought in me fayth, in Christ my Redeemer, by which I am assured that he hath borne the punishment of my syns, & made me heyre wyth him of euerlasting life. And of this that I should neuer doubt, he hath geuē me two Sacraments, as outward signes and tokens to be seene and felt of me, that as surely as I see my selfe made partaker of them outwardlye, so the holye Ghost inwardlye enstructing me, I shoulde not doubt, but inwardly to be partaker of Christ him selfe with al his benefites, that in hym and through hym I shall haue lyfe euerlastyng. And thus beyng regenerate into this liuely hope by ye holy Gost, my waies should be directed by ye same spirit, to walke in holynes & righteousnes al the daies of my lyfe.
