            TO THE RIGHT HONORAble Sir ROBERT LEE Knight, Lorde Maior of the renowned City of London, and to the right Worſhipful the Sheriffes, and alſo to all the right Worſhipfull the Aldermen their brethren, THOMAS THAYRE wiſheth all ſpirituall and temporall bleſsings from the Lord in this life, and in the life to come eternall ſaluation, through Chriſt Jeſu our Sauiour.
            
            
               COnſidering with my ſelfe, Right Honorable, and right Worſhipfull, that nothing is more neceſſary, nor more deſired in the time of dangerous ſickneſſe and perill of death, then to preſent vnto the perſon ſo ſtanding, the meanes to preſerue him from the violence of the ſame, and to reſtore the ſick from imminent perill of death, vnto his former eſtate of health; and perceiuing, right Honorable, that no man had as yet written any treatiſe, wherein was contained ſuch ſpeciall and

excellent medicines, that might be able to reſiſt, and alſo cure this dangerous and contagious ſickneſſe; and likewiſe to giue ſufficient inſtruction & direction vnto the inhabitants of this Citie, for their preſeruation in this infectious time: I was mooued in conſcience (my Lord) for the dutie I owe, and for the loue I beare vnto this honorable city, to cōmunicate vnto them ſuch preſeruatiues, as are, through Gods grace, giuen vnto them able to reſiſt and defend from infection of this ſickneſſe all ſuch as vſe thē. And alſo I haue ſet down moſt excellent & approued medicines, ſuch as I haue practiſed and approued vnto the great vtilitie of manie, beeing able, through Gods mercy, ſpeedily to cure the moſt and greateſt part of al ſuch as ſhall be infected with this ſickneſſe, beeing vſed in time, before the ſickneſſe hath vtterly ouercome nature. And although my inſufficic̄cy to write any publique matter, perſwaded me to relinquiſh my intēded purpoſe in publiſhing this treatiſe, I being the meaneſt of ſo many in this land, and vnable to write any plauſible ſtile: yet the truth & plainnes of the matter, the excellency of the medicines, & the vtility that many ſhould find thereby, being vſed, ouercame that doubt of mind, and animated me to proceede in my intended purpoſe; not doubting, but aſſuredly truſting in the Lord, frō whom commeth all health, that this beeing vſed, many ſhall bee preſerued, and cured thereby, to Gods glory and our comfort: he it is on whom we muſt depend. The Lord hath created medicine ne ope diuina

hearbes, gums, ſtones, and minerals, and all for the helpe of his people in the time of their ſicknes. God make vs thankfull vnto him for them, & giue vs grace to be warned by others puniſhment, and to vſe thankfully and diligentlie, the good means for our health: and then I truſt aſſuredly that the Lord will bleſſe our indeuours, vnto his glory, and our health' and comfort. And for as much as I haue written this treatiſe chiefelie in reſpect of the citie, I haue preſumed to dedicate the ſame vnto your Honor, & vnto the right Worſhipfull the Sheriffes and Aldermen your brethren, as a pledge of my loue and humble duty towards you: which if it ſhall pleaſe you to accept in good part, and vouchſafe to patronize mine indeuours, I doubt not but that manie ſhall finde the benefit therof to Gods glory & their great comfort: and I ſhall be incouraged ſome other time, as occaſion ſhall be offred, to performe a work no leſſe needfull: Thus beſeeching the Almightie to bleſſe your Honor, & the right Worſhipfull your brethren, with all happineſſe your hearts can deſire, I humblie take my leaue.
            
               Your Honors and Worſhips to command,
THOMAS THAYRE.
            
         
         
            
            To the louing Reader grace and health from the Lord.
            
            
               CAlling vnto mind (curteous reader) the ſaying of TVLLY, Non nobis ſolùm nati ſumus, &c. we are not born vnto our ſelues alone, but we owe a dutie and ſeruice vnto our countrey, our parents, & our friends, and conſidering with my ſelf vnto my griefe, the ſickneſſe, the which it hath pleaſed God to viſit vs withall, is greatly increaſed, diſperſing it ſelfe into manie places of this citie to the griefe of manie: I hauing duly conſidered thereof, thought it my dutie to vſe the ſmall talent that the Lord hath lent me vnto his glory, and the good of my brethren: which moued mee to write this Treatiſe ſhewing the cauſes of the peſtilence: the meanes to preſerue vs from the infection of this contagious ſickneſſe: and the way and methode to cure ſuch as ſhall be infected therewith, vſing the remedie in time, I meane in the beginning of the ſickeneſſe, before nature be ouercome, obſeruing the order of this booke. And for as much as this is Gods viſitation for our iniquitie, wee muſt therefore firſt fly vnto him with contrite hearts, fixing our whole truſt in his mercie: And then wee muſt with all diligence and thankfulnes of heart, vſe the good meanes

that the Lord hath ordained for our health. For to neglect the meanes, is to contemne Gods gifts; and we make our ſelues guiltie of our owne death, and before God we are no better then murtherers, becauſe we haue deſpiſed the meanes of our helpe that he hath ordained for vs. But I truſt there are none ſo wilfull and obſtinate in this citie. This Treatiſe (gentle Reader) I haue penned, and preſent vnto thee, plaine and ſimple, barren of eloquence and filed phraſe to delight thee: yet herein is contained moſt excellent and approued remedies, and as effectuall for the curing of this ſickneſſe, as are, or haue beene knowne. Vſe them in Gods name, and doe not truſt vnto light and trifling medicines, conſidering the ſtrength and daunger of this ſickneſſe: Theſe haue power and vertue, through Gods grace, to expulſe and ſpeedily to cure this infectious ſickneſſe: and for preſeruing a perſon from infection I haue ſet downe manie preſeruatiues. And for curing the ſickneſſe I haue ſet downe foure principall medicines, and three others of leſſe ſtrength, to bee vſed when the aforenamed cannot be had. All which you may haue readie or ſpeedily made at euery good Apothecaries. Vſe them I counſell thee in the beginning of this ſickneſſe, for delay breedeth daunger: and death commonly followeth, and medicine comes too late when nature is ouercome by the ſickneſſe. And for as much as I haue written this Treatiſe for the benefit of all men in generall, that thinke good to vſe it, & haue done it in loue & good wil, ſo I hope the well diſpoſed will cenſure it. And no godly and vertuous minded Phyſition will be herewith offended, or enuy my endeuours, conſidering it is for the benefit and helpe of many in this or ſuch like dangerous time, wherein many periſh for want of counſel and helpe in their ſickneſſe, at the beginning

               thereof. And where anie ouerſight or defect hath paſſed in my booke, as I doubt not but that there are ſome, hauing ſo ſhort time, and ſo little opportunity to ouerlooke it, I deſire the learned Reader to correct and amend the ſame: and in ſo doing I ſhall be vnto him beholding. And ſo now taking my leaue, I beſeech God of his great mercy to bleſſe the meanes that we ſhall vſe for our health, vnto the honour, glorie and praiſe of his holy name, and vnto our health & comfort. Farewell luly the ninth.

            A Treatiſe of the Peſtilence: wherein is ſhewed all the cauſes thereof, with moſt aſſured preſeruatiues againſt all infection.
            
            
               THis contagious ſicknes which is generally called the Plague or Peſtilence, is no other thing then a corrupt and venemous aire, deadly enemie vnto the vital ſpirits: moſt commonly What the Plague is. Aerem vitiati ac putridum. bringing death and diſſolution vnto the body, except with ſpéede good remedy be vſed. I mean not that the aire of it ſelf is a verie poiſon, for then conſequently all perſons (for the moſt part) that liue within the aire ſo corrupted, ſhould be infected, and few or none eſcape the danger thereof: but my meaning is, that the aire hath in it ſelfe a venemous qualitie, by reaſon whereof thoſe bodies wherein there is Cacochymia, corrupt and ſuperfluous humours abounding, are apt and lightly infected, thoſe humours being of themſelues inclined and diſpoſed vnto putrifaction. Now I will proceede to ſhew the cauſes of this dangerous ſickneſſe, and alſo the cure thereof.
            Now hauing briefly defined what the Peſtilence is, I will (God aſſiſting me) proſecute mine intended purpoſe. Firſt, in ſhewing all the cauſes thereof, and the cure, and remedie for euerie cauſe.
            Entring into due conſideration of the cauſes of the Peſtilence that now raigneth, Chriſtian Reader, I find there are thrée cauſes thereof.
            
               
The firſt and chiefeſt is ſinne.

            The ſecond is the corruption of the aire.
            The third and laſt cauſe, is the euill diſpoſition of the body, bred by euill diet, and the abuſe of things called Res non naturales, things not natural: not ſo called, for that they are againſt nature, but becauſe through the abuſe of them nature is debilitated, corrupted, and oftentimes vtterly deſtroyed.
            The firſt cauſe, I ſay, is ſinne. The holy Scriptures ſufficiently proueth the ſame, and giueth manie examples 
                  
                     ••
                  e firſt cauſe. how the Lord oftentimes puniſheth his people for their ſin and impietie of life with the Peſtilence. Reade the 14. chapter of the booke of Numbers, and the 11. and 12. verſes: where the Lord ſpeaking vnto Moſes, ſaying: How 
               
                  
                     ••
                  mb. 14. 11. 
               long will this people prouoke me? and how long will it be ere they beleeue me, for all the ſignes I haue ſhewed among them? I will ſmite them with the peſtilence, and will deſtroy them, and will make thee a greater & mightier nation then they.
            
            Why doth the Lord here threaten the children of Iſrael his choſen, to ſtrike them with the Peſtilence? the reaſon is ſhewed in the ſame chapter: becauſe (ſaith he) they haue murmured againſt me, and haue rebelled, not keeping nor obſeruing my lawes. And as the Lord ſpake vnto the children of Iſrael by Moſes, ſo ſpeaketh he vnto vs dayly by his miniſters and preachers of his word.
            Alſo reade Deuteronomy the 28. chap. the 1. 2. 3. and 4. verſes, and there you ſhall ſée the bleſſings that the Lord promiſeth vnto them, that walke in his waies and 
                  
                     •
                  ut. 28. 1. 2. 
                     •
                  . kéepe his commandements: And it followeth in the ſame chapter: But if thou wilt not obey the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep and doe his commandements: The Lord ſhall make the peſtilence to cleaue vnto thee. And many more curſes hee pronounceth againſt them that continue in their ſin and iniquitie of life. And further, The Lord ſhal ſmite thee with a conſumption, & with a feuer,
               
               and with a burning ague, and ſo forth. This ſpake the Lord vnto the children of Iſrael his people, and this ſpeaketh the Lord daily vnto vs: but we are ſlow to repentance and amendment of life.
            Reade Leuiticus the 26. chap. and the 21. verſe. And if you walke ſtubbornly againſt me (ſaith the Lord) and 
               Leuit, 26. 2
                     •
                  
                
               will not obey my word, I will bring ſeuen times more plagues vpon you, according vnto your ſinnes. And in the third verſe following he ſaith: I will ſend the peſtilence among you, and you ſhall bee deliuered into the 
               Verſ. 3. 
               hands of your enemies. This ſpake the Lord vnto the inhabitants of Ieruſalem, and this ſpeaketh hee vnto vs oftentimes by his Miniſters, whom we ought with all reuerence to heare, and with all diligence to follow. Many more places could I cite and inferre out of the ſacred Scriptures, to proue ſinne to be a cauſe of the Peſtilence, and ſometime the onely cauſe thereof: example in Dauid: example in Pharao, and diuers other, which for prolixitie I omit, hoping this may ſuffice to proue ſinne to bee a cauſe of the Peſtilence, which is indéede as a meſſenger or executioner ſometimes of Gods iuſtire. Manie and great plagues hath this our land taſted of in times paſt, and it is not yet tenne yeares ſince this Citie of London was viſited and afflicted with this ſicknes, diſperſing it ſelfe into diuers and many places of this land, cutting off and taking away a great multitude of people: and I doubt not but ſin was a great cauſe thereof. O that man would therefore remember the inconſtancie and ſrailtie of this life! And conſider the end of his creation was to ſerue and glorifie God: but we daily diſhonour him by committing of ſinne, and not giuing vnto him that honor and ſeruice that is due vnto the Lord: But placing all our affections vpon the vaine delights and inconſtant pleaſures of this alluring and deceitfull world, which do as it were bewitch vs, and withdrawe vs from that Chriſtian care that we ought to haue of our ſaluation, abuſing Gods mercie and long ſufferance with our delayes

and procraſtination to turne vnto him, being miſebly deluded by ſatan, and intiſed by the glittering ſhewes of this world, to the loue thereof; and God knowes how ſoone we muſt leaue it. I pray God infuſe his grace and holy Spirit into our hearts, that ſinne may be mortified in vs, and that it may worke in vs a reformation and amendment of life: & that we may henceforth walk in this our ſhort pilgrimage, as Chriſtians and ſeruants of the Lord, ſeruing him in all holineſſe and pietie of life, contemning the vaine pleaſures of this fraudulent world, which are but ſnares to intrap our ſoules, and the baites of Sathan to draw vs vnto deſtruction: then ſhall we not need to feare death, but ſay with Saint Paul, Mors mihi lucrum, Death vnto me is gaine, ſaith he: ſo is it indéed vnto all the godly: but vnto the wicked it is an entrance into a continuall and eternall puniſhment: from the which Chriſt that hath died for vs, deliuer vs. Amen.
            Now hauing ſhewed ſin to be one cauſe of the Peſtilence, and ſometimes the onely cauſe, when it pleaſeth God to puniſh the impietie of his people, vſing it as the executioner of his wrath: it followeth that I ſhewe the other cauſes, whereof the Peſtilence may ariſe. The ſecond cauſe, is the corruption of the aire.

                of the Peſtilence: 
                  Ʋnam, aërem vitiatum ac putridum: alterā, humores corporis vitio ſo victu collectos, & ad putreſo endum paratos; The one cauſe is (ſaith he) an infected, corrupted, and putrified aire: the other cauſe is, euill and ſuperfluous humors gathered in the body through haughtie and corrupt diet, which humours be apt and ready to putrifaction. And this is moſt true, and not onely the opinion of Galen and Hippocrates, the Fathers and princes of Phyſicke, but of all the learned and iudiciall Phyſitions of latter time, and at this day. Now let vs conſider how, and by what meanes the aire may be corrupted and altered from his wholſom qualitie vnto a venemous

diſpoſitiō. Entring into due conſideration therof, I finde many cauſes that may corrupt the aire, all which I will compoſe or include in theſe two.
            The firſt cauſe whereby the aire may bée corrupted, is through the vnholſom influence of yt planets; who by their malitious diſpoſition, qualitie, and operations, diſtemper, alter and corrupt the aire, making it vnholeſome vnto humane nature.
            When the temperature of the aire is changed from his naturall eſtate, to immoderate heate and moiſture, Note. then it corrupteth and putrifieth, and ingendreth the Peſtilence. I emit to write what I haue read concerning the Gal. de diff. febrium lib. 1. cap. 5. alterations and mutations, that are ſometimes cauſed by the ſuperior bodies or planets here below vpon the earth: for vnto the learned it were ſuperfluous, and vnto the vulgar or common ſorte, it woulde rather bréede admiration then credite: but this euerie man is to vnderſtand, Deus regit Aſtra, GOD rules the ſtarres: and yet I doubt not, but through the Eclipſes, Exaltation, Coniunctions, and aſpectes of the Planets, the aire may bée corrupted, and made vnholeſome ſometimes, in ſomuch that diuers griefes are bred thereby.
            The ſecond cauſe, whereby the aire may be corrupted, 
                  
                     The ſecond cauſe of the peſtilence.
                  
                  
                     Rotten exhaltions may corupt the aire.

                           ••
                         of the peſtilēd is the euill dipoſition of the body.
                  
                is a venemous euaporation ariſing from the earth, as from fennes, moores, ſtanding muddie waters, and ſtinking ditches and priuies, or from dead bodies vnburied, ſtinking chanels and mixſones, and multitudes of people liuing in ſmall and little roome, and vncleanlie kept: all theſe are cauſes and meanes whereby the aire may be corrupted.
            The third cauſe of the peſtilence, is the euill diſpoſition of the body, which is bred by euill diet: the bodie being repleat with corrupt and ſuperfluous humors, which humors bereadie to putrifie and rot vpon anie light occaſion: And when ſuch a perſon doth but receiue into his bodie by inſpiration, the corrupted and infections aire, he is therewith by and by infected, his bodie being diſpoſed

thereunto through ſuperfluous and corrupt humors abounding: whereas contrarie wiſe, a body of a good diſpoſition, I meane a body frée from groſſe, corrupt, and ſuperfluous humors, is not caſtlie or lightlie infected, becauſe there is not that matter for the infectious ayre to worke vpon. And againe, nature is more ſtronge to repell the infectious or corrupted ayre, if it be receiued: and perfected

                  . this is the cauſe why one perſon is rather infected then another; namelie the diſpoſition of the bodie.
            Now hauing ſhewed all the cauſes of the peſtilence; I will (GOD aſſiſting mée) ſet downe the cure and remedie for euerie cauſe, which cauſes being taken away, the effect which is the ſickneſſe, muſt néedes ceaſe.
            The firſt cauſe, I ſay, is ſinne: and this ought firſt to be taken awaie, and then I dare vndertake (by Gods aſſiſtance)

                  m eſt. my corporall medicines ſhall ſoone ſtaie this furious ſickneſſe. Sinne is a ſickneſſe of the ſoule; the cure thereof dooth conſiſt in theſe two points. The firſt, is true, hartie, and faithfull repentance, with all contrition of heart confeſſing thy ſinnes vnto the Lorde, with faithfull prayer vnto Chriſt Ieſu, that it will pleaſe him to be an aduocate and mediator vnto the Lorde for the forgiueneſſe of thy ſinnes. Do this, and thou ſhalt find GOD mercifull, hee is readier to forgiue then we to aske forgiueneſſe of him. He would not the death of a ſinner, but with all mercy, patience, and long ſuffering wayteth and expecteth our conuerſion vnto him.
            The ſecond point, is newneſſe of life: for what ſhall it auaile vs to haue forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, if we fall into the ſame againe, and walke in our former euilneſſe of life? This will but increaſe Gods wrath and indignation againſt vs, and exaſperate him to puniſh our impietie of life with all ſeueritie. Therefore, I counſell thee, as thou tendreſt the ſaluation of thy ſoule, flie from euill, and do the thing that is right; walke vprightlie before him in newneſſe and holineſſe of life: for the Lord ſéeth all thy waies, and knoweth the thoughts of thy heart long before.

Then ſhalt thou ſtād before the tribunall ſeat of the Almightie & iuſt Iudge, where all thy whole life ſhal be laide open, and all thy actions, and thoughts of thy heart made manifeſt and knowne. Then happy and ten times happie are they, vnto whom the Lord ſhall ſay: Come yee bleſſed of my Father, receiue ye the Kingdome prepared for you before the beginning of the worlde. But how vnhappie, and in what miſerable eſtate are they, vnto whom the Lord ſhall ſay: Goe you curſed into eternall darkneſſe, a place of puniſhment appointed for you: where there is horror, weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. This is the place appointed for the vngodly worldlings that wallow and continue in their ſinne, neglecting the ſeruice of the Lord: for which end they were created. Conſider this (good Chriſtian Reader) and defer no time to turne vnto the Lord: for this life of ours is fraile, vnconſtant, and very vncertaine. We haue examples daily before our eies of the vncertainty thereof, to day a man, to morrow none. Homo natus Muliere paucorum dierum eſt, & repletur inquietudine, ſaith Iob: Man that is borne of a woman his daies are fewe, and is full of miſery.
            
            For thy further inſtruction, I refer thée vnto the godly and learned Diuines, heare them: for they are the meſſengers and miniſters of the Lorde, appointed to teach his people, and in mée it might be noted for preſumption, to take vpon mée the office of another man, hauing in this point more néede to be taught my ſelf, then able to inſtruct others. The cure of the ſoule belongeth vnto them, and thē cure of the body vnto me. I will now haſten vnto the ſecond cauſe, which is the corruption of the aire.
            I haue ſhewed before all the cauſes that may corrupt the aire: it followeth now that I teach the correction, purging and altring of the aire corrupted, which is the ſecond cauſe of the peſtilence.

            Alſo, that al the pondes, pooles, & ditches about the City, if they yéeld any ſtinking and noiſom ſmels, that they be ſcoured and clenſed: for there ariſeth from them an euill and vnholeſome aire, which furthereth the corruption of the aire, and worſe will do in hotter weather.
            Alſo, that you ſuffer no mixſons to be made ſo néere vnto the Citie as they are, but to be caried far off: neither any dead carion to lie vnburied, as I haue ſéene, but to be

This fumigation hath a moſt excellent and ſingular propertie, to purge and alter a corrupt and vnholſome aire.
            But peraduenture ſome men for want of Iudgement, wil think this my direction ouer curious & of ſmall validity: but I do and will affirme, that the vſe thereof is very requiſite, and of great force & vtility, and the beſt meanes for the purging and altering the euill qualitie of the aire, that is knowne vnto man.
            This fumigatiō is to be vſed where the infection is, in the euening, and alſo in the morning; & is of great force for the

            Now hauing ſhewed the remedies for the two firſt

cauſes; it followeth, that I teach the cure of the third and laſt cauſe, which is the euill diſpoſition of the body, through ſuperfluous, corrupt, and euill humors abounding. Here is the cauſe, and theſe corrupt and ſuperfluous humors muſt be taken away before the body can bée in any good eſtate of health. And this is the reaſon that diuers perſons liuing together in one aire, that one is infected and not another, namely, the diſpoſition of the body: for thoſe naughtie, corrupt, & ſuperfluous humors, are of themſelues apt and diſpoſed vnto putrefaction, and if it ſo chance that they do putrefie of themſelues, then there ariſe dangerous feuers, according vnto the nature of the humor that corrupteth. As for example, If choler do putrifie within the veſſelles, it ingendreth febris ardens or febris cauſon, a hot and a dangerous feuer, working his malice in the concauitie of the liuer and lunges and about the heart, & except remedy be adminiſtred the perſon dieth. And ſo when any of the other humors doe putrefie, there ſpringe feuers, according vnto their nature, as the learned knowe. Now ſuch bodies (I ſay) wherein there is ſuch ſuperfluous humors abounding, in the time of any infection, receiuing into their bodies the corrupt perſons 
                     •
                  t to be 
                     •
                  ed. and venemous aire, are thereby infected: And theſe humors turned not only into putrefaction, but into a venemous qualitie, by the operation of the infectious aire Whereas in bodies voide and frée from ſuch ſuperfluous humors, there the infectious aire hath not ſuch matter to worke vpon: and againe, nature is more ſtrong and forcible to reſiſt and expell a corrupt and infectious aire although receiued.
            Here the reaſon is apparant why one perſon is infected and not another. And very niedfull it is eſpeciallie in this time of ſickneſſe, that this euill diſpoſition of the body be taken away and amended, by purging and euacuating of the perccant humors. For which purpoſe I wil ſet down a very excellent and approued potion, which purgeth the

blood and diſburdeneth the body of ſuperfluous humors both choler, flegme, and melancholie, opening attracting and euacuating the corrupt and vitious humors of the body, to the great comfort, helpe and eaſe of thoſe that vſe it with diſcretion, as I ſhall direct Yet it were good to take counſell of ſome Doctor. them: the making or compoſition whereof I haue here ſet downe.
            But firſt taking this ſirrup thrée morninges before you purge, two ſpoonefuls euerie morning, faſting after it two or thrée houres, and vſe your accuſtomed diet as before.

            Let this infuſion be made in ſome earthen ſtupot cloſe couered and paaſted that no breath or vapor goe forth, and let it ſtand ſeuen or eight howers vpon ſome imbers, or ſmall coles, and but warme: after which time ſtraine it forth and put thereunto of Diacatholicon one ounce, Diaphenicon halfe an ounce, Electuarium Succo roſarum halfe an ounce, mix theſe with the infuſion aboue written, and this will be a ſufficient quantitie for thrée daies, taking the third part the firſt day, and on the ſecond day the halfe of that which was left, and the other part the third day: take it early in the morning, and ſléepe not after the taking of it, neither eate, nor drinke vntill it hath wrought his effect, & then take ſome broth made with

a chicken or a capon, and for want thereof with veale or yonge mutton, as you can bee prouided, with What is to be obſerued in the

When your potiō hath done working you may take of this broth, and alſo a little of your meate ſparingly, and in the euening make a light ſupper with a chicken, or a rabbet, or ſuch like meat that is light and eaſie of digeſtion, yéelding good nutriment: The next day early, take another part of your drinke, and vſe your ſelfe as the day before. And likewiſe the third day, take that part of your potion that remained, and vſe your ſelfe as before taught. This being done, reſt a Gods name, & vſe a good and a moderate diet, and beware of exceſſe and ſuperfluitie; for he that vſeth it ſhall fall into the hands of the Phiſition, but he that dieteth him ſelfe prolongeth his life.
            Now if it ſo happen that your potion do not worke within two howers after the receiuing thereof, which is verie ſeldome ſéene in any body, then take a little of your broth, or if it be not readie a little thinne alebrue, either of which will cauſe it to worke forthwith. Or if you feare through weakenes of your ſtomacke, you ſhall vomit after the taking thereof, then as ſoone as you haue receiued your potion, let there be made ready a browne toſt, which being dipt and ſokened in good vinegar, holde it vnto your noſe, and ſmell therunto ſometime. You ought to kéepe your chamber during the thrée daies, that you take your potion.
            And it is very requiſite alſo, that you kéepe your houſe the day after your purging: becauſe the pores of the body will be opened thereby. This potion is of great vertue, and not only deliuereth the body from a diſpoſition to be infected with this ſickneſſe; but alſo from many other griefes and diſeaſes ſpringing

and ariſing by repletion, and corruption of humors, and very gently and eaſily purgeth both choler and flegme from the ſtomacke without moleſtation And draweth from all parts ſuperfluous humors. of the body, or weakning of nature. And this is eſpeciallie good for ſuch as want appetite vnto their meate, and ſuch as féele an vnweildineſſe, and ſlouthfulneſſe in themſelues, hauing no delight in exerciſe, dulneſſe of the wit and ſences, more ſléepie then accuſtomed to be, ſhiuering of the body, mixed with Theſe are the ſignes of repletion. heate, as if they ſhould haue an Ague.
            And if any thinke this a tedious courſe, and therefore loath, or vnwilling to vſe it, let them conſider that health is not obtained without ſome meanes be vſed, and let them not thinke much to take a little paines for the gaining of ſo pretious a Iewell, without the which although abounding in worldly wealth, yet we can take delight, pleaſure, or contentation in nothing: As for healthy bodies, ſuch as are free from corrupt and ſuperfluous humours, vſing a good diet and exerciſe of bodie, ſuch (I ſay) are not lightly infected as others are, in whom there is repletion: it ſhall be ſufficient for them without purging to vſe anie of the preſeruatiues I haue ſet downe in this booke. And let them bée aſſured by the vſe thereof, and by Gods aſſiſtance, from all infection, although the ſickneſſe were more ſtrong and powerfull then it is: And although I aſſuredly know, that this potion béeing vſed may ſuffice to take away the euill diſpoſition of the body, yet becauſe I know many would bee loth to be inioined to kéepe their chamber foure dayes as they ought to doo, that vſe this potion or any other purging potion, I haue for their benefite ſet downe a moſt excellent pill that purgeth all corrupt, and ſuperfluous humors, and is with all a very good preſeruatiue, defending the body from all infection.

Notwithſtanding you may ſafely goe abroad about your buſineſſe, without any inconuenience at all.
               And hauing now ſhewed how the euill diſpoſition of the body may be amended, and taken away by gentle purging and euacuating of the peccant humors, bred by euill diet, and the abuſe of the ſix things called, Res non naturales, whereof I will briefly ſpeake, teaching what ought to be auoided, as hurtfull and preiudiciall vnto your health.
            
            
               In receiuing of the aire.
               The aire is one of the Elements wherof our bodies are compoſed; and without the inſpiration, and reſpiration thereof we cannot liue: and therefore it ſtandeth much with our health, that the aire which we receiue into our bodies, bée ſwéete, holeſome and vncorrupt. And I counſell al men that they auoide all places of infection, all ſtinking and noiſome ſmels; and when they are diſpoſed to walke, that they walke in gardens, or ſwéete and pleaſant fieldes: but neither

early nor late at night. I haue ſet downe the making of a good pomander, the which I would wiſh to bee worne not only of Gentlemen, but of others alſo for the good property it hath both in reſiſting a corrupt, noyſom, and ſtinking aire, and in comforting the ſenſes. I doe not intend in this place to write of the nature of aires and the election thereof; it would be ouer tedious, who ſo deſireth it, let him reade Hippocrates de flatibus: alſo Auicen, and Raſis haue written copiouſlie thereof. And you ought to obſerue aire as meate, cold ſickneſſes require warme aire, drie ſickneſſes moiſt aire: & ſo in the contraries, to them that be long ſicke, change of aire is very commodious; & to Both in feuers dropſies, rhumes falling ſickneſſe. ſuch as be in health, a temperate aire is moſt holeſom. And where the aire is infected and corrupted, I haue ſet downe moſt excellent perfumes, for the correcting and purging thereof both for the ſtréets, houſes and chambers, and by the vſe thereof the euill qualitie of the aire ſhalbe taken away.
            
            
               In eating and drinking.
               In eating and drinking, we ought to conſider that the meates that we eate and receiue for the nouriſhment of our bodies be ſwéete and holſome, yéelding Galen de humoribus. good iuyce: for ſuch as the meat is, ſuch humors it bréedeth in the body: if it be harde of digeſtion it dooth debilitate and weaken nature, and ouercharge the alteratiue vertue of the ſtomacke: if ſwéet, it bréedeth oppilations, whereof dangerous feuers ariſe; ſower cooleth nature and haſteneth age: moiſt dooth putrifie and haſten age, drie ſucketh vp naturall moiſture, ſalt dooth fret, bitter dooth not nouriſh, ſo that in diuerſitie of meates is great diuerſitie of qualitie. A man that is in health ought to vſe Qualitie. a temperate diet, and féeding ſparingly vpon one,

two or thrée diſhes at the moſt, and if we meane to liue in anie health of bodie all ſuperfluitie, & repletion of meates is to be abhorred. Conſider with thy ſelfe, thou art a man indued with reaſon, and therefore in thy diet and all other thy actions let reaſon and temperance Quantity. gouerne thine appetite & affections: through ſurfetting manie one hath periſhed, but he that dieteth Eccl. 7. himſelfe, prolongeth his life. The varietie of meates at one meale bringeth paine vnto the ſtomacke, offendeth nature, and doth ingender and beget many diſeaſes, as Galen witneſſeth, reaſon teacheth, Galen iuuent. nēbrorum lib. 1. cap. 4. and experience approueth. Therefore whoſo is in health, and deſireth to continue therein, let him obſerue this rule. Let his meate that he vſeth be wholſome & nouriſhing, ſuch as beſt agréeth with his nature and complexion: for vnto ſome men béeſe is more holeſome and better then chickens, or ſuch like fine meates: the reaſon is, digeſtion is ſtrong through heate, as in cholerike perſons, in whom light and fine meates are rather burnt then digeſted: therefore groſſer meates are for them more holeſome and better. And let him alſo note what meates doe offend, or diſagree with him, and let him refuſe it as hurtfull: and in ſo doing he ſhall be a Phyſition vnto himſelfe. Note alſo that thou maiſt eate more meate Heate is the cauſe, of digeſtion. in winter then in ſommer, becauſe digeſtion is more ſtrong, by reaſon that naturall heat is incloſed in the ſtomacke, but in ſummer vniuerſally ſpread abroad into the whole body: ſo the ſtomacke wanting this naturall heate, digeſtion is thereby more weake. Cholerike perſons and children may eate oftner then anie other, by reaſon of their heate and quicke digeſtion. Time and place will not permit mee to write what I would concerning diet, the obſeruation whereof is a verie ſpeciall meanes for the preſeruation of health: & many times ſickneſſes are cured by

the benefit of diet. In hote ſickneſſe vſe a cold diet: in a moiſt ſickneſſe vſe a drying diet, Contraria contrariis curantur: all diſtemperatures are cured by Auicen. Hippocrat. in Aphoriſ. their contraries. I will here end of diet: wiſhing thée to remember this ſaying of Hippocrates, Studium ſanitatis eſt non ſatiari cibis, the means or ſtudie to preſerue health, is to eſchue fulneſſe or ſuperfluitie of meates and drinkes. So is it indéede, and eſpecially in a time of ſicknes, as this is. And it is now excéeding good with all your meates to vſe ſharpe ſauces made with vinegar, or roſe vinegar, Orenges, Limons, Pomegranates, and a little Cinnamon and Maces. But forbeare and refuſe all hot ſpices, and ſtrong wines, Onions, Garlicke, Léekes, Cabage, Radiſh, Rocket, and ſuch like: the vſe of them is verie Except one draught for a cold and weake ſtomacke. hurtfull and dangerous. But theſe are good and holeſome: Borage, bugloſſe, ſorrell, endiue, cichorie, violets, ſpinage, betonie, egrimonie, they are good both in ſalades, ſauces, and broth: and your diet ought in this time of infection to bee cooling and drying.

And ſléep is no leſſe needfull for the preſeruation of our liues then foode. Theſe are of themſelues good, but we, through the abuſe of them, change their natures, and make them hurtfull vnto

vs. Immoderate ſléepe, and ſléeping in the day is very euill: it dulleth the wit, it repleats and fils the bodie with euil humours, it ingendreth rheume, and maketh the body apt vnto palſies, apoplexies, falling ſickneſſe, impoſtumes; and finally, ſlow and vnapt vnto any honeſt exerciſe.
               Note alſo that we ought not to ſléepe immediately after meat before it be deſcended from the mouth of the ſtomacke, for thereby digeſtion is corrupted, and paines, and noiſe in the belly ingendred: Alſo our ſleepe is made vnquiet and troubled by euill vapours aſcending: therefore I counſell all men that are in health, and deſire the continuance thereof, that they auoid ſléeping in the day time, eſpecially

               Of exerciſe and reſt.

Celſus teach, and experience approueth.
               Idleneſſe and reſt is a contrarie vnto exerciſe: it is the mother of ignorance, the nurſe of diſeaſes, it corrupteth the mind, it dulleth the bodie, filling and repleating it with ſuperfluous and euill humours, which breede manie ſickneſſes. And as exerciſe and labour is a preſeruer of health, ſo idlenes is the ſhortner of life, enemy vnto the ſoule and body, and very vnprofitable in a Cōmon-wealth, and alſo hurtful in a priuate houſe. And remember this, that vehement exerciſe be not vſed preſently after meate, for it wil conueigh crude and vndigeſted iuyce vnto each part, which is very euil & hurtfull. But exerciſe is good before meate, and two or thrée howers after meate, being moderately vſed. Exerciſe is beſt and moſt conuenient, when the firſt and ſecond digeſtion is complete, as well in the ſtomacke, as in the vaines. But in ſuch a time of infection as this is, I cannot commend exerciſe, becauſe it will too much open the pores, and the pores being opened, the bodie is apt to receiue the infectious aire. Much more would I ſay of the benefit of exerciſe, and the inconuenience of idleneſſe, but that I ſhould be ouer-tedious in this place.
            
            
               
               Of fulneſſe and emptineſſe.
               All fulneſſe and ſuperfluitie of meates are to be eſchued, for as much as they make repletion: And all bodies in whom there is repletion, are apt to bee infected. And ſuch bodies muſt endeuour to kéepe themſelues ſoluble: All euacuations are good for them, as purging and bléeding, except ſome ſpeciall cauſe doth forbid it: And let them vſe a ſparing and frugall diet. And they may ſafely, and with great profit vſe the pill I haue ſet downe before in my booke. And as I haue ſaid, repletion is an enemie vnto health, bringing and begetting ſickneſſe, and ſometime ſodaine death: ſo is too much faſting and emptineſſe, no leſſe hurtfull: it weakeneth the braine, and drieth the whole bodie, conſuming the radicall moiſture in man, and ſhorteneth life.
               And as repletion is to be abhorred and auoided, ſo alſo increa

               Of affections of the mind.
               Affections of the mind are called by M. Cicero, Perturbations. Galen calleth them Pathemata vel affectus anims, and nothing is more hurtfull in this time of ſickneſſe, nor greater enemie vnto life, then feare, ſorrow, anger, heauineſſe and griefe of mind. Anger is a dangerous paſſion: it chafeth the bloud, and diſquieteth the heart: it inflameth the ſpirits: which aſcending vp into the head, annoieth the animall powers

leſſe hurtfull vnto the body: for they waſte the naturall heat and moiſture, wherein life conſiſteth; making the bodie leane and drie, whereupon conſumption followeſh: it dulleth the wit and vnderſtanding, and draweth the ſpirits and bloud inward to the heart: and withall attracteth the venemous and infectious aire, if we liue within the compaſſe thereof. If I ſhould here ſtand to write of all the perturbations for the mind, defining and diſtinguiſhing them one from another, ſhewing the wonderfull effects of them, and the inconuenience therof, I ſhould be ouer tedious in this ſhort Treatiſe, and it might ſeeme impertinent in this worke: onely this I wiſh thée to remember, Sub te erit appetitus tuus, & tudominaberis illi: Vnder thée ſhall be thine appetite, and thou ſhalt beare rule ouer it, ſaith the Lord. We muſt therefore maiſter our affections: for if they be not ouer-ruled and gouerned by wiſedome, they will excéede, and proue daungerous enimies both vnto ſoule and bodie. And in this time of ſicknes we ought ſpecially to auoid theſe perturbations of the mind, and to vſe all vertuous and commendable mirth, ſwéete muſicke, good companie, and all laudable recreation that may delight you, and vſe the perfumes in your chambers, and in other roomes of your houſes that I haue ſet downe, being caſt into a fuming pot or chafing diſh vpon a few coales. Do this euening and morning: the charge thereof is ſmall, but the vtilitie is great. It purgeth the aire, and taketh away the euill qualitie thereof.
               Now hauing ſhewed what ought to be auoided, it followeth, that I ſet downe preſeruatiues that may reſiſt all infection: which God aſſiſting me, I will do.
               Firſt of all, I counſell all men in whom bloud doth abound, the which they may eaſily know themſelues, by the heate of their bodies, colour, largeneſſe

and fulneſſe of their vaines, that they be let bloud in the liuer vaine in the right arme: and let the quantitie be according vnto the ſtrength of the perſon.
               Alſo that all men in generall auoid all bathes and hote-houſes, and all vehement exerciſe, that may ouerheate the body, and inflame the bloud.
               Alſo the companie of women this hote and contagious time is verie hurtfull, and therefore ought to be vſed with great moderation.
               Alſo walking verie early in a morning, and verie late in the euening, is hurtfull and dangerous. Alſo auoide all preaſe and throng of people where a multitude are aſſembled, & al noiſome & vnſauourie places.
               Now hauing ſhewed all the cauſes of the peſtilence, and ſet downe the cure and remedie for euerie cauſe: I will by Gods aſſiſtance, for the care I haue of the preſeruation of the inhabitants of this honorable citie, and for the loue I beare vnto them and my countrie, communicate vnto them moſt excellent and approued preſeruatiues and of ſingular vertue: which whoſe vſeth them, ſhall not néed to feare the infection of this contagious ſicknes. Firſt, with an humble and contrite heart deſire mercie of the Lord: and then commend thy ſelfe vnto his protection: which being done, vſe the good meanes he hath ordained for thy health.
            
            
               Pilles of eſpeciall vertue in preſeruing all that vſe them.
               
                  R. Good Aloes half an ounce waſhed in roſewater: of good myrrhe, of ſaffron, of each two drams: bolearmoniac. praep. one ſcruple: ſeed pearle one ſcruple: ſir. of limons as much as wil ſuffice to make them in pilles, or in a maſſe.
               
               
                  
Take halfe a dramme hereof made in pilles euerie ſecond or third day in the morning; faſte after it thrée or foure houres: but it ſhall be good for you to take a little thinne broth, or a little alebrue, or ſixe or eight ſpoonefuls of wine within an houre after, and vſe your accuſtomed diet, as before.
            
            
               Another pill that doth more moue the bodie, and giueth two ſtooles, or three in ſome bodies, and this is good for ſuch as are coſtiue, and in whom humours abound.
               
                  R. Good Rubarbe, choſen myrrhe, of each one dram; choſen aloes two drams: zedoarie roote one ſcruple: ſaffron one ſcruple: ſirrup of Roſes ſolutiue as much as will ſuffice to make the maſſe.
               
               This pill purgeth gently, and preſerueth the bodie from all infection.
               Such bodies in whom humours doe abound, and are moſt commonly coſtiue, may vſe theſe pilles, taking half a dram euerie morning, for thrée, foure, fiue, or ſixe dayes together, as they pleaſe. Take after it either a little thin broth, or of an alebrue, or a draught of wine, if it bée not too hote for your complexion, and vſe your ordinarie diet as accuſtomed, if it be good.

But women great with child may not take of theſe pils, neither of the other pils ſet down before: let them content themſelues to eate in a morning, ſome conſerues of ſorrell, roſes, or borrage, wherewith

               But here I had almoſt forgotten one preſeruatiue which many men commend, and is good indéede, but eſpecially for fearefull perſons, ſuch I mean as liue in feare of this ſickneſſe, and although I haue placed it laſt, yet not the leaſt to be regarded: Citò, longe & tarde, we muſt flie away ſpéedily, and we muſt go far off, and returne againe ſlowly, it is good for thoſe that can cōueniently ſo do. Let vs put our whole truſt in the Lord, from whom commeth all helpe, and with contrite hearts for our iniquitie vſe the good meanes that the Lord hath ordeined and created for vs, and caſt away all feare, & I doubt not, but by Gods aſſiſtance this ſicknes ſhall be taken away.
               To eate euery morning as much as the kernell of A preſeruatiue. a nut of Electuarium de ouo, is a good preſeruatiue.
               
                  
So is treacle of Andromachus deſcription, which you ſhal haue at the Apothecaries, mix with it as much Conſerues of Roſes.
               Thrée or foure graines of Bezoar ſtone taken in the morning in a ſpoonefull of ſcabious, or ſorrell water, is a good preſeruatiue.
               So is a little Diaſcordium taken in the morning the quantitie of two white peaſon.
               Alſo to vſe the roote of Angelica, ſtieped in vinegar to chew in your mouth as you go in the ſtréet is good, and to eate a little thereof.
               Gentian, Zedoarie, Turmentill, chewed and kept in your mouth are good.
               Sorrell eaten in the morning with a little good Vinegar like a ſallet, is very good: the vſe of Orenges and Limons is very good, Pomegranates and Vinegar.
               It is good euery morning betime, to take ſome good preſeruatiue, and before you goe abroade, it ſhall not be amiſſe to eate ſomething to your breakfaſt that is holeſome, as bred, and ſwéet-butter, a potcht egge with vinegar, or ſome other thing as you are prouided, & vſe alway in going into any infected place a roote of Angelica to chew vpon in your mouth, a little ſpunge dipt in Roſe-vinegar to ſmel vnto often times is good, put into a pomander box of iuorie.
               Alſo to weare a Pomander about your necke and ſmell to it oftentimes, is very good.
               Let your chāber be dreſt with ſwéet flowers as theſe, ſwéet mints, time, penerial, carnatiōs, roſeleaues: and let your chamber bee ſtrued with gréene ruſhes, Vine leaues, Oken leaues, and Willow leaues & Mintes.
               If you haue any windowes towards the North or northeaſt kéep them open in cléere daies; your chamber ought alſo to bee perſumed oftentimes, with the perfumes taught in this book; you may vſe Iuniper Beniamin, Storax and wood of Aloes.
            
            
               
               For your diet.
               Yong Mutton, Veale, Kid, Capors, Hennes, Chickens, Rabbets, Partridge, Feſant, Quaile, Plouers, ſmall birdes of the fields, Pigeons, ſwéete butter, potched egges with vinegar, but not in hot complexions.

                  Galen commendeth Garlicke, calling it the poore mans treacle, but vndoubtedly it is too hote to be eaten of cholericke perſons, or ſanguine, or in a hote ſeaſon, and therefore I cannot commend it, except in cold, moiſt and rheumaticke bodies, for whom it may be good.

or meaſure of eight ſpoonefuls, & make it warme, and drinke it in Gods name, ſweate well thereupon, and thou ſhalt be deliuered from danger of the ſickneſſe, and is a moſt approued medicine and ſpéedie remedie, if it be taken in time: for herein cenſiſteth the danger, namely delay, in which time the venome pierceth vnto the heart, and there ſetleth, and vanquiſheth the vitall ſpirits.

               The ſignes that ſignifie and declare a perſon to be infected with the peſtilence.
               The firſt is, a great paine and heauineſſe in the head. 1.
               
               The ſecond is, hée féeleth great heat within his bodie, and the outward partes cold and readie to 2. ſhake, and is thirſtie and drie therewithal.
               The third ſigne is, he cannot draw his breath eaſily, 3. but with ſome paine and difficultie.
               The fourth ſigne is, he hath a great deſire to ſléepe, 4. and can very hardly refraine from ſléeping, but beware hée ſléepe not. And ſometimes watching dooth vex and trouble him as much and cannot ſléepe.
               The fift ſigne is, ſwelling in the ſtomacke with 5. much paine, breaking forth with ſtinking ſweat.
               The ſixt ſigne is, diuers & heauie lookes of the eies, 6. ſéeing all things of one colour, as gréene or yellow, and the eies are changed in their colour.
               The ſeuenth ſigne is, loſſe of appetite, vnſauourie taſte, bitterneſſe of the mouth ſowre and ſtinking. 7.
               
               The eight ſigne is, wambling of the ſtomacke, and a deſire to vomite, and ſometime vomiting humors 8. bitter and of diuers colours.
               The ninth ſigne is, the pulſe beateth ſwift and déepe.
               The tenth ſigne is, a heauineſſe, and dulneſſe in 9. all the body, and a faintnes and a weakeneſſe of the 10. limmes.
               
                  
The eleuenth ſigne is, the vrine moſt commonly is 11. troubled, thick & like beaſtes water, & ſtinking, but

               The twelfth and laſt ſigne, and ſureſt of all other, is, there ariſeth in the necke, vnder the arme, or in the flanke, a tumor or ſwelling, or in ſome other part of the 12. bodie there appeareth any red, gréeniſh, or blackiſh coloured ſore, theſe are moſt apparant ſignes to the eye, that this perſon is infected with the peſtilence.
               But take héede, bée not deceiued: for oftentimes a perſon is ſtrongly infected with the Peſtilence, and hath neither Apoſtume, Carbuncle, nor botch appearing, in two or thrée dayes, by which time hée is néere his death: therefore when a botch dooth not appeare ſpéedily, it is alwaies an euill ſigne and dangerous. The reaſon hereof is, nature is weake, and the infection and poiſon is ſtrong and furious: and nature being weake as in children, and in aged perſons, and in others alſo, through the euill diſpoſition of the body, is not able to make reſiſtance againſt ſo furious, and puiſſant an enemie, and to expulſe the infection or poiſon.

and ſo is all other ſickneſſes.

The verie cauſes indeed that ſo many die of this ſickneſſe are two. The firſt is the ſtrength, power, and venemous qualitie of this ſicknes, ſpéedily ſurprizing the vitall ſpirits.
               The ſecond cauſe is, our delay to vſe medicine in time, and not vſing good and effectuall medicines, ſuch as haue vertue by Gods grace giuen vnto them

               And againſt this contagious ſickneſſe, I haue ſet downe good preſeruatiues, which being vſed, will by Gods grace preuent the danger. And alſo moſt excellent and approued remedies for this ſickneſſe, that whoſo vſeth them in time, ſhal vndoubtedly by Gods grace and mercie be ſpéedily cured. Now it followeth, that I teach the vſe of them, and the true and perfect cure of the peſtilence, and what is to be obſerued in the cure thereof.
               And firſt, I will teach the cure of the peſtilence when no botch or ſore appeareth, and how to preuent the riſing of any botch or ſore moſt commonly in all perſons.
            
            
               
               The cure of the Peſtilence, when no botch, or ſore appeareth, and how to preuent the riſing of any botch or ſores moſt commonly in all perſons.
               In the cure of this ſicknes there are thrée intentions eſpecially required. The firſt is to aide and helpe nature, to expell the infection and venemous poiſon. 3. Intentions required in the cure of this ſicknes.
                   The ſecond is to comfort the heart, and other the principall members of the body. The third is a good obſeruation in diet, afterward to be vſed. And at the firſt when any perſon féeleth himſelfe ſicke, let him well conſider, whether any of the ſignes before ſet downe, that ſignifie a perſon infected, be in him or no: & if he find any of them at al in himſelfe, then let him be aſſured it is the ſickneſſe. But héere hée muſt not deferre the time, doubting, and making farther trial, whether it bée or no: For in this time when the peſtilence Beware you ſleepe not vntil you haue taken your medicine, & eight houres after. reigneth, there are few other ſickneſſes. The nature of this venemous and corrupt aire is to alter and conuert other ſickneſſes into the peſtilence, as we find moſt true by experience. And againe, the nature and qualitie of this dangerous ſickneſſe, is, euer with all ſwiftneſſe to approch and aſſaile the heart the principall member and fountaine of life. Héere may it appeare, how dangerous delay is in this ſickneſſe, in not vſing ſome good and approued medicine, that hath vertue through Gods gift to withſtand the force thereof, and power to expell the venemous infection Vſe help in the firſt beginning of this contagious ſickenes. Now to preuent this lyon of his pray, note what is to be done.

And if there ſhould be felt anie foreneſſe in any ſide of the body more then the other; then let him bléede in that arme on the ſide grieued; which being done, let the chirurgion decently bind vp his arme: and if the perſon be weake, then let this be done in his bed, and with ſpéede let him take one of the foure medicines ſet downe before in this booke for the cure of the peſtilencé, the quantitie and the maner is there ſet downe. Let him receiue his medicine warme, and procure him to ſweat: which if he cannot eaſily doe, then muſt you fill ſome bottles with hot water, and ſet them in the bed about him, by which meanes you ſhall cauſe him to ſweate ſpéedily. Let him continue ſweating thrée, foure, or 5. houres, or according to his ſtrength, as he can endure it, giuing him, if he be verie drie in

The patient hauing ſweat well, drie his bodie with warme and ſoft clothes, and if the ſhéetes be wet with ſweat, then pul them away, and let him reſt in Gods name, ſo hee ſléepe not. And giue him to eate ſometimes of one of the confections, that comforteth the heart, that giueth great comfort and ſtrength vnto the body and principall members thereof, and therefore not to be omitted. Two houres after his ſweate giue him to eate ſome broth made with a chicken or a capon. In which broth boile Endiue, Borage, Bugloſſe, and a little parſly, raiſins of

the ſunne, and two or thrée dates, and a little whole mace. Let his drinke be good, ſtale, and middle ale, wherein you muſt boile whole mace and ſome ſugar. What drinke the patient ought to vſe. To mitigate and take away his drineſſe and thirſt. And if he be very drie, as commonly in this ſickneſſe they are, then giue him a ſpoonefull of one of the ſirrups ſet downe in this booke for that purpoſe, which doth both aſſooage thirſt and drineſſe, and comforts the heart withall, he may vſe to take a ſpoonefull when he is drie.

And aboue all things, let him be of good comfort, fixing his hope aboue in the Almightie, from whom commeth all help, health, and God is the author of health. comfort: for obſeruing what I haue taught, there is no danger of death: and for the moſt part all they that vſe this order and direction, recouer and be frée from all danger within two or thrée dayes, except ſome verie few, that haue vnſound and very corrupt

And this will I vndertake by Gods leaue and his holy aſſiſtance to performe, and that not one in ſixe perſons ſhall die that taketh a good medicine, and that vſeth this order and followeth my direction: for by this meanes of taking away of bloud, euacuation by ſweate and purging the bodie, the infection and poiſoned matter is expelled: inſomuch that ſeldome riſeth anie botch or ſore, becauſe the matter whereof the botch ariſeth is otherwiſe caſt forth.

                      vinegar together. him to ſmell vnto oftentimes a cloth wet in roſe vinegar. Now muſt the ſore or botch be looked vnto. And to ripen and bring it to ſuppuration, you ſhall find medicines ſet downe in this booke. If the ſore do ariſe néere the heart, I haue ſet downe meanes to defend the heart, and to drawe the ſore or botch further off: or if the botch appeare in the throte, then likwiſe

draw it further for feare of ſuffocation, or choking the patient. If watching or rauing trouble him, I haue ſet downe meanes to helpe it. If thirſt and drineſſe vexe him, I haue ſet downe comfortable ſirrupes to remedie it, or whatſoeuer he ſhall néed in this cure, if aduiſedly you follow my direction.
               The patient ought to change his chamber ſometimes, Change of chambers is good. and to vſe often the perfumes before ſet down: and to kéepe the houſe all the time of his ſicknes vntill his ſore be well, changing himſelfe in freſh apparell well aired, and perſumed before.
               And thoſe that are about him muſt haue care of themſelues, and eate daily euery morning ſome good preſeruatiue. And aboue all, let them take héede of the aire or breath of the ſore when it is opened: alway holding ſome roote of Angelica ſtieped in vinegar in their mouth, or ſome other ſtrong and good preſeruatiue, and let them eate ſometimes a little good mithridatum, or anie one of the confections preſeruatiue ſet downe in this booke againſt the peſtilence: and alſo let the kéeper take héede how to beſtowe the plaiſters that come from the ſore.
               Well now remember what I haue ſaid ought to be done in this cure of the peſtilence.
               Firſt, that with all ſpéede you vſe remedy without delaying the time, for therein chiefly conſiſteth the danger.
               Secondly, that you bléed, if no cauſe forbid it, as afore is taught.
               Thirdly, that you take one of the medicines before ſet downe in this booke, and ſweate therewithall, and refraine from ſléepe.
               Fourthly, that you vſe the cordials to comfort the heart ſet downe, and that you eat of them oftentimes in the day.
               Fiftly, that if the patient be faint, you muſt vſe the

Epithymum, and cpithymate the heart therewith.

               The ſeuenth obſeruation is, that with ſpéede you apply medicines to ſuppurate the ſore, and drawe it forth.

               The ninth is, that he vſe the diet before taught, eating a little at a time, and the oftner. And to vſe the ſirrups and conſections to coole and comfort.
               The tenth, which ſhould haue béene the firſt, is, that the patient in anie caſe be kept from ſléepe, from his firſt ſickening vntill he haue taken his medicine, and ſweat, and ſire or eight houres after, and then to ſléepe but one houre, and the next day let him ſléepe thrée houres at times, but not aboue one houre at a time: and after the third day you may giue him more ſléepe. But in the beginning of his ſicknes, it is moſt dangerous: for by ſléepe the ſpirits are drawne inward, and therewithall the venome is attracted vnto the heart, and alſo the feuer made more vehement and ſharpe. And this is the cauſe that many die, that might liue if they were kept from ſléepe, and therewithall take ſome good medicine.
               The eleuenth is, that the patient kéepe his chamber during the time of his ſicknes, and refraine all companie, that he hurt not others.
               The twelfth is, that being well, he giue humble thanks to God, and then let him change his apparell, being well perfumed, and in the name of God goe abroade.
               
                  
And if the botch ariſe néere vnto the heart, then before you ſweate, it were good to apply this defenſitiue vnto the heart, being thinne ſpread vpon a fine cloth, as broad as wil couer the heart.

               Oftentimes and moſt commonly in this contagious ſicknes the patient is troubled with lightneſſe in his head, and cannot ſléepe: the reaſon hereof is, Note

the braine is diſtempered by heate: Hote vapours aſcending and flying vp from the ſtomacke. And this is the reaſon they ſléepe not: and the cauſe of their raging is want of ſléepe, and a diſtemperature of the braine.

               Apply this frontall vnto his head, as afore taught. I haue ſet downe theſe meanes to cauſe and prouoke ſléepe, and ſtay the raging that is oftentimes in this ſickneſſe. But you muſt note, that this is not to be vſed in the beginning of his ſickneſſe: For in the beginning of the ſickneſſe the perſon ought in anie wiſe to be kept from ſléepe. For as through ſléepe the ſpirits are drawne inward, and the venome therewith attracted vnto the heart: ſo the heat is alſo excéedingly increaſed through ſléepe.
               Therefore this meanes that I haue ſet downe for cauſing of ſléepe or anie other to ſléepe, may not bée

tops halfe a handfull: woodbine leaues and collumbine leaues, halfe a handfull: ſhred and bruiſe theſe hearbes a little, and then boyle them in a quarte of faire water, which beeing well boyled, ſtraine it forth, and put thereto Diamoron two ounces, ſirrupe of Roſes two ounces, mel Roſarum or honey of Roſes two ounces: mixe theſe, and let the patient vſe it often to waſh and gargarize his mouth.
               
               The vſe of a little white wine ſometimes is good with Roſe-water, and a little vinegar to waſh his moth withal.
               To vomit at the beginning of the ſickneſſe is good: Note this, whē vomit is good. for if a perſon fall ſicke at his meate, or within a while after his meate; then ought hee to prouoke vomite, and when he hath vomited, then to take a medicine ſet downe for the cure of the peſtilence, and ſweat therewithall, and do as I haue taught Cordials and ſweat will ſtay vomiting. in this booke before: but if he bée much troubled with vomiting in his ſickneſſe, then let him vſe this that I ſhall teach him.

               And if his vomiting ſhould not ſtay, then were it good for him to take ſome gentle purging potion to expulſe theſe corrupt humours that ſucketh vp that diſpoſition to vomite.
               I doubt not but what I haue written is ſufficient for the interiour part. Now will I come to the externall and outward application, and ſhew what is to bee done in ſuppurating and opening the ſore.
               
                  
Hauing taken one of the medicines afore taught, and ſweat, vſing the cordiall appointed, apply vnto the ſore this vnderwritten, which will drawe it forth, and ripen it: and you muſt haue ſpecial care that with ſpéede you draw forth the ſore, apoſtume or carbuncle, leaſt it returne againe into the bodie.
            
            
               A plaiſter to ſuppurate, drawe forth, and ripen the ſore or botch, although common, yet very good and commended of al that vſe it.
               Take a great white Onion, & cut off the head of it, & with your knife picke out the coare or middle part, and fill that hollow place full of good treacle, not common treacle, but Theriaca Andromachi, which you ſhall haue at the Apothecaries. Put on the head of the Onion, and paaſt it with a little dow or leuen, and ſet it to roſte in the imbers, and being ſoft roſted, take it forth and pill it, and ſtampe it in a morter, and lay it hote vnto the ſore vpon ſome double cloth, and rowle it ſoftly that it fal not off, & renew it and lay on freſh, euery ſixe houres.
               And here I muſt néeds commend the vſe of a yong cocke to be vſed in this maner vnto the ſore. Pull away the feathers from about the fundament of the cocke, and place the fundament vpon the ſore, and hold his bill ſometime to kéepe in his breath, he ſhall the better draw the venome: & if he die, then take another, and do ſo againe. Then lay on this Cataplaſma, which I haue often vſed, and approued to bee verie good to draw forth and ſuppurate the ſore.
               
                  R. One Lilly roote, young mallowes, one handful, let them be bruiſed in a morter: Lineſeede two or three
                  
                  ſponefuls beaten groſſely, boyle them together in ſufficient water, or as much as will couer them, boyle them vntill they be very ſoft and thick, then put thereunto Figges ſix or ſeuen: halfe a good handfull of raiſins ſtoned, mix theſe together, and put vnto it oyle of Camomil two ſpoonefuls, and being very warme lay it to the ſore, and binde it ſoftly that it may abide on, change it euery twenhoures.
               
            
            
               Another that ripeneth the botch and bringeth it ſpeedely vnto ſuppuration.
               
                  R. Onions and Garlicke heads, of each of them in number foure: roſt them in the imbers, then ſtampe them in a morter, and put thereto of fenegreeck and line ſeede of each a good ſpoonefull, ſnayles with their ſhelles foure or fiue, figs in number foure: leauen as much as a Walnut, barrowes liquor as much as two walnuts, mix them in a morter, and warme it & apply it vnto the ſore.
               
            
            
               An Implaiſter that ripeneth the ſore or botch.
               
                  R. Galbanum Ammoniacum, Bedelium ana j ounce, diſſolue them in vinegar at the fire and ſtrain them and put thereto diachilon magnum ij. ounces, mix them and ſpread it vpon a thick cloth, and lay it to the ſore and change it euery xvi. houres.
               
            
            
               Another plaiſter that draweth forth the ſore and ripeneth it ſpeedily.
               Take a white Lillie roote, yong mallowes two handfull, ſcabious one handfull: ſhred them and bruſe

them, and boile them in a ſufficient quantitie of ale grounds, and put thereto of line-ſéede two or thrée ſpoonefuls beaten, and as much fenegréek beaten likewiſe, ſower leauen as much as two walenuts, mixe them, and lay it warme vnto the ſore, changing it euery ſixtéene houres, two or thrée times vſing it, ripens the botch.
               By vſing any of theſe pulteſſes, or cataplaſmes, you may ſpéedilie ripen the botch or ſore, and béeing breake not ſelfe by meanes dily. ripe, it ought to bée opened by the Chirurgion in the lower part thereof, that the matter may be the better auoided. And remēber this note, that whatſoeuer you apply or lay vnto the botch muſt not be cold, I meane cold in qualitie and operation. For cold medicines would driue backe againe that venemous matter true hath expelled, to the great daunger of the that napatient.
               And if you feare the opening of it, which is indéeds nothing to ſuffer, then let the Chirurgion vſe a potentiall inſtrument, I meane a cauſticke, and béeing done vſe this digeſtion.
               
                  R. Cleare Turpentine waſhed one ounce, a yolke of a newe laide egge, as much: oyle of Saint Iohns worte halfe a dram, of good Mithridatum halfe a dram.
               
               Mixe all theſe together and vſe it vnto the wounde vntill it be wel digeſted, which you may know by the whiteneſſe, thickneſſe, and great quantity of the matter. And notwithſtanding it is now running, yet ſhall it bée good for you to vſe one of the pultiſe afore taught, it will ripen and bring forth the reſt. This is dangerous for thoſe that are about you, therefore bée carefull to kéepe your chamber, and alſo how you beſtow the plaſters that you vſe vnto your ſore, that others

be not infected thereby. You ought to vſe dayly in your chamber the perfumes before ſet downe thrée or foure times a day, to vſe a good diet, and to eate of ſome of the cordials before ſet downe, and your ſore béeing néere well, then ought you to purge with one of the potions before ſet downe.
            
            
               What is to be done when a ſore or botch lieth deepe and commes not forth.
               You muſt take one of the medicines afore ſet down for the cure of the plague, and ſweat therewithall: but 
                     
                        Vſe cordials to comfort the heart.
                     
                     
                        The cauſe why the ſore coms not forth, is weakneſſe of nature.
                     
                   if the Apoſtume or ſorely déep, notwithſtanding your ſweat, then muſt you faſten cupping glaſſes ouer or vpon the ſore, firſt ſcarifing the place, and when you haue vſed your cupping glaſſes, then vſe a yong cock or pullet, as before is taught, pulling the fethers from about the rumpe and taile, putting a little ſalt into the fundament of the cocke or pullet, ſet it vnto your ſore houlding the bil of him ſometime to retaine his breath: and if he die take one more, and do as before, and then apply the plaiſter of onions and treacle ſetdown before: and then applie ſome one of the other which will bring it to ſuppuration, then let it be opened as before taught.
            
            
               What is to be done when the botch wil not come to ſuppuration, but continues hard.
               If a botch come not to ſuppuration within thrée or foure daies, as moſt commonly it dooth, but reſiſteth your application continuing hard, then muſt you vſe ſome cauſtick or ſtrong veſſicatorie, or inſitiō which I like not of, the matter béeing vnripe or not altered into corruption: the continuance of a botch vnſuppurated and not drawn forth is very dangerous: the reaſon is, the venome gathereth ſtrength by putrifaction within

the body and returnes vnto the heart againe. Then farewell life. This I haue knowne, and I am perſwaded may die that might liue, if this were ſéene vnto. Therefore to preuent danger, rather open the botch before it be full turned vnto ſuppuration, and vſe cataplaſmes and pulteſſes to ripen the reſt that remaines. But being ſtill hard, then I ſay you muſt vſe the counſell of a chirurgion, and open it with a cauſticke, as I before ſayd, how and wherewith I 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      with a

               Firſt, before it bée opened, let it be well epithymated: and vſe ſome cordiall ſet downe in this book, two or thrée times a day. And then vſe digeſtions and ſalue to heales.
            
            
               What is to bee done when a botch ſtrikes. in againe.
               Sometimes I haue knowne the botch to appeare, and yet ſodainlie to fall in againe, and this is euer a dangerous and deadly ſigne. But I will ſhewe you all that may bee done: and manie haue by this meanes béene relieued from death.
               Firſt, with all ſpéede giue him ſome one of the foure Electuaries ſet downe in this booke for the cure of the plague, the quantitie is there ſet downe: and procure him to ſweate as long as he can endure it. Then drie him with warme clothes. And giue him cordials to eate of, ſet downe in this booke. Then ought hee to haue a gliſter, the which I will ſet downe, and the next day early giue him my purging potion ſet downe before: the which is good in this caſe: and giue him often cordials to eate. And by

this meanes (by Gods grace) the patient ſhall be deliuered from death.
            
            
               The Cliſter.

               When a botch ariſeth neare vnto the heart, or in the throte: then muſt you deſire helpe of the Chirurgion, When a botch ariſeth in a dā
                     gerous place what we muſt doe. who with cupping glaſſes may drawe the ſore or botch farther off. To ſet downe the maner héere it were néedleſſe, euery chirurgion that hath anie iudgement and practiſe knowes how to do it.
