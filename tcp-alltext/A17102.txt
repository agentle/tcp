               QUhairas of thynges iudicially determinit within any dominioun, to haif accompte demandit by strangeris, is to sic as be not subiect to forane iurisdictioun, baith strange, and also for the strangenesse displeasant, to vs aboue all vther it ought to be most greuous, quha are driuen to this streight of necessitie, that quhase fautes we desire to couer, thair liues we are enforced to accuse, vnlesse we will our selues be accompted the most wicked persons that lyue. But a great part of this gréef, is releued by your equitie (most excellent Quene) quha take it no lesse displeasantly to sée your kinswoman, than we to sée our Quene thus in speche of all men to be dishonorably reported, quha alswa are for your part no lesse desirous to vnderstand the truth, than we for ours to auoide sclaunder. Thairfoir we will knit vp the mater as bréefly as possibly may be, and declare it with sic shortnesse, as we may rather seme to haue lightly runne ouer the chéef pointes than to haue largly expressed tham, begynnyng

at the Quenes first inconstancie. For as in making of her mariage, her lightnes was very hedlang & rash, so sodanely followed either inwart repentance, or at least outwart tokens of change of her affection without any causes appearing. For quhair before time the king was not onely neglected but also not honorably vsed, at length began open hatred to breake out against him, specially in that winter quhen he went to Peble with small traine euen too meane for the degrée of a priuate man, not being sent thether a hawking, but as commandit away into a corner far frō counsell and knawledge of publike affaires. Nouther is it necessarie to put in writing those thinges, quhilk as thay were than as a spectacle noted of all mens eyes, sa now as a fresh image thay remane imprintit in all mens hartes. And though this were the beginning of all the euills that followed, yet at the first the practises were secrit, sa as not onely the commoun pepill, but alswa sic as were right familiar and present at the doing of many matters, could not vnderstand throughly, what

thing the Quene than chéefly intended.
            At the last about the moneth of Aprill in the yeare 1566. quhan the Quene was returned from Dunbarre to Edinburgh, and was lodged in the castell, she keipt her thare till the time of her trauaile of childe. After her deliuerance immediatly the secret counsels of the intendit mischeif began to breake out, quhairof the effect was this, to dispatch away the king by one way or vther howsoeuer, and to mary with Bothwell. And that her selfe should not be touchit with suspicion of the murder, she began secritly by littil and littill to sow sedes of dissentioun betwene the king and the Lordes that were than in Court, and by mair and mair inflaming tham, to bring the mater to deadly feude. And if at any time she espied the suspicions of the one against the vther to languish, by and by with new reportes to baith partes, she whetted tham on againe to fresch displeasuris, persuading the Nobilitie against the king, and the king against the Nobilitie, that either intendit vthers destruction. And she thought nothing so long as to sée the mater come

to strokes, for douting whether of thā she had rather to haif the victorie, she accounted the losse on either side for her auantage, as hoping thairby to auance forward one degrée neirer to that quhilk she intendit. Finally in short time she so filled all thair hartes with mutuall ialousies one against an vther, that thare was not a man of any reputatioun in the Court, but he was driuen to this necessitie, either with dishonour to yeld to rumors fained against him, or to enter into combate with the reporters, or to withdraw him home. And though we shall passe ouer the rest for desire to hast to the cheif point of the matter, yet this one notable sclanderous practise at that time, is nat to be omitted. For on a time quhen the king had ben in talke with the Quene till it was farre in the night, the summe in a maner of all her communicatioun was, that almost all the nobilitie had conspirit his death, & wer deuising how to dispatch him. After the kinges departure from her, she sent forthwith for the Erle of Murray hir brother, wha after was Regēt, with this message, that the matter was

hainous, and necessarily requiring his presence without delay. He being awaked out of sound sléepe, in great feare, cast a night gowne ouer his shirt, and as he was halfe naked ranne to her in hast. To him than she vsed euin the like talke as she had before to the king, informing him that the king boyled in such deadly hatrit against him, and tooke it so displeasantly that he stood so hyely in her grace, that he was fully determinit, so soone as any possible opportunitie serued, to murder him. So, as mekle as in her lay, she left no meane vnassayit to set tham together by the eares, and without all dout had done it in deid, if it had not ben Gods gude pleasure to deliuer the innocent persons frō so perilous treasons, & to disclose her wicked trechery.
            Quhen this attempt failed her, she assayit the yong & vnexperienced gentlemā with ane new suttilpractise. She earnestly labored him, that quhile she was great with childe,The Quene offreth to be baude to hir owne husband. he should choose him some yong gentlewoman, quhairof thare was great store, quhose companie he might vse in the meane time. She promised him her assent and furtherance,

with pardon and leaue to cō
               mit the offence. She named to him the Erle of Murrayes wife, not for that she estemed that most noble Lady most apt for sic a villanie, but because she thought by that way to be reuenged of thrée enemies at once, the king, the Erle, and his wife, and therwithall to winne a colour and cause of diuorce to make empty bedroome for Bothwell. After that she was deliuered of childe, though she courteously enterteined all vther, yet as oft as word was brought her that the king was come to sée her, baith she and her company so framed thair speche & countenance, as if thay semed to feare nothing mair than that the king should perceaue that thay lothed him, and that his comming and presence was displeasant to tham all. On the vther side Bothwell alone was all in all, he alone was gouerner of all her counsels and all her affaires. And so desirous was the Quene to haue her hartie affection towart him vnderstood of all men, that if any sute were to be made to her, thare was no way of speding for any man but by Bothwell to obteine it.
            
               Nat lang after her deliuerance, on a day very early, accompanied with very few that wer priuie of her counsall, sche went downe to the water side at the place called the New hauen, and while all maruelled whether she went in sic hast, sche sodenly entred into a ship there prepared for her, quhilk ship was prouided by William Blacater, Edmond Blacater, Leonard Robertson, and Thomas Dicson, Bothwelles seruantes & famous robbers & pyrates. With this trayde of thiefes, all honest men wonderyng at it, sche betooke her selfe to sea, takyng nat ane vther with her, na nat of her gentlemen nor necessarie attendantes for common honestie. In Aloe castell, where the shyp arryued, how sche behaued her selfe, I had rather euery man should with hym selfe imagine it; than heare me declare it. This ane thyng I dare affirme, that in all hir wordes and doynges sche neuer kept any regard, I will nat say of Quenelike maiestie, but nat of matronelike modestie. The kyng, quhen he heard of this sodeine departure of the Quene, followed after with all

the hast that he possibly cauld by land, and there ouertuke hir, in purpose and hopyng there to be her company and to enioy the mutuall louyng fellowshyp of mariage. But how louingly he was receiued of her, baith all they that wer present, and sic as haue heard tham report it, can well remember. For being scarcely suffered to tarry there a few houres, while hys men and horses bayted, he was enforced to get hym away in hast agayne an peine of further perill. As for hir self, sche pastimed there certayne dayes, if nat in princely magnificence, yet in mair than princely or rather vnprincely licentiousnesse. There went sche a huntyng, ones at the riuer of Magat, an vther tyme at the forest of Glenartue. There how coylye, yea how loftily and disdaynfully she behaued her selfe to the kyng, quhat nede it be rehearsed, for the thing was opēly done in all mens sight, & continueth emprint it in all mens memorie.
            Quhen sche was returned to Edenburgh, sche tuke nat her ladgyng in her owne palace, but in a priuate house next adioyning to Ihon Balfoures.

Thense sche remoued into an vther house quhair the yerely courte, quhilk they call the Exchequer was then kept: For this house was larger, and had pleasant gardens to it, & next to the garden altogether a solitarie vacant roome. But there was an vther mater quhilk, mair thā al these things, specially allured her thether. There dwelt hardby one Dauid Chambers, Bothwels seruāt, whoes backdore adioynit to the garden of the Quenis ladging. The rest, wha gesseth nat? for the Quene hir selfe confessed the mater baith to many vther & also namely to the Regent & hys mother. But sche layed all the blame vpon my ladie Rerese a womā of maist vile vnchastitie, wha had sometime been one of Bothwels harlots, and than was one of the chefe of the Quenis priuie chamber. By this woman, wha now in her age had from the gayne of horedome betaken hir selfe to the craft of bawderie, was the Quene, as her selfe sayd, betrayed. For Bothwel was through the garden brought into the Quenis chamber, & there forced hir agaynst hir will forsothe. But how much agaynst hir

will Dame Rerese betrayed her, tyme the mother of truth hath disclosed. For within few dayes efter, the Quene intending as I suppose to reaquite force with force and to rauish hym agayne, sent Dame Rerese, (who had her selfe also before assayit the mans strength) to bryng hym captiue vnto her hyghnes. The Quene with Margaret Carwod, a woman priuie of all her secretes, dyd let her downe by a stryng ouer an auld wall into the next garden. But in sic weirlike affaires, all thynges can not euer be so well foreséen, but that some incommodious chaunce may ouerthwartly happen. Behald, the stryng sodenly brake, and downe with a great noyse fell Dame Rerese, a woman very heauy baith by vnweldy age & massy substance. But sche an auld beaten soldiar, nothyng dismayed with the darkenes of the night, the heighth of the wall, nor with the sodennesse of the fall, vp sche getteth, & winneth into Bothwels chamber, sche gyt the dore open, and out of his bed, euen out of his wiues armes, halfe a slepe, halfe naked, sche forceably bringes the man to the Quene.

This maner and circumstances of the dede, nat onely the maist pairt of tham that then wer with the Quene haue confessed, but also George Daglish Bothwelles chamberlane, a litle before he was executed playnly declared the same, quhilk hys confessioun yet remayneth of recorde.
            In the meane tyme, the kyng commanded out of sight, & with iniuries and miseries banisched from her, kept hym selfe close, with a few of hys seruantes at Stereline. For alas quhat should he els do? He could nat créepe into any pece of grace with the quene, nor could get so much as to mainteine his dayly necessarie expenses to finde his few seruantes and hys horses: and finally with brawlynges lightly rising for euery small trifle, and querels vsually piked he was chaced out of her presence. Yet his hart, obstinately fixed in louing hir, cauld not be restrained, but he must neidis come backe to Edenburgh of purpose with all kinde of seruiceable humblenesse to get some entrie into hir former fauour, and to recouer the kinde societie of mariage. Quho ones againe with maist dishonourable

disdaine excludit, anes again returneth frō quhense he came, thare as in solitarie desert to bewaile his woefull miseries.
            Within few dayes after, quhen the king determined to goe to Iedworth to the assises thare to be halden, about the beginning of October, Bothwell maiketh his iorney into Liddesdale. Thare behauing himself nouther according to the place quhairto he was called, nor according to his nobilitie of race and estimation, he was waunded by a poore théefe that was him selfe ready to dye, and caryed into the castell called the Heremitage, with great vncertaintie of his recouerie. Quhan newes hereof was brought to Borthwik to the Quene, she flingeth away in hast like a mad woman, by great iourneyes in poste, in the sharpe time of winter, first to Melrose and than to Iedworth. Thare though she heard sure newes of his life, yet hir affectioun impatient of delay cauld not temper it self, but nedis she must bewray hir outragious lust, and in an vnconuenient time of the yere, despising all discōmodities of the way & wether, & all dangers

of theifis, she betooke hir self hedlong to hir iourney with sic a company as na man of any honest degrée wald haif aduentured his life and his gudes amang tham. Thense she returneth again to Iedworth, and with maist earnest care & diligence prouideth & prepareth all thinges to remoue Bothwel thether. Quhen he was ones brought thether, thair company and familiar haunt togither was sic as was smally agreing with baith thair honours. Thare, whether it were by reason of thair nightly and daily trauailes, dishonourable to tham selfis and infamous amang the pepill, or by some secrit prouidence of God, the Quene fell into sic a sore and dangerous sickenesse, that scarcely thare remained any hoip of hir life.
            Quhan the king heard thairof, he hasted in post to Iedworth, to visit the Quene, to comfort hir in hir weakenesse, and by all the gentill seruices that he possibly cauld to declare hys affectioun and harty desire to do hir pleasure. So far was it of that hys lodging and thynges necessary was prouidit for him agaynst his cōmyng (quhilk is

wont to be done euin for meane persons) that he found nat any ane token toward him of a freindly minde. But this was a point of maist barbarous inhumanitie vsed against him, that the Nobilitie and all the officers of the Court that were present were specially forbidden, not anes to do him reuerence at hys comming, nor to yeld him thair lodging, nor to harber him so mekle as for ane night. And quhairas the Quene suspected that the Erle of Murray, quhilk afterward was Regent, wald shew him curtesie, she practised with his wife to goe home in hast and faine hir selfe sicke, and kepe hir bed, that at least by thys colour, vnder pretense of hir sicknesse, the king might be shut out of doores. Being thus denied all duties of ciuile kindnesse, the next day with great gréef of hart he returned to his auld solitarie corner. In the meane time quhile the king in that want of all thinges, and forsaken of all freindes, scant with begging findeth rowme in a cotage, Bothwell out of the house quhaire he was lodged befoir, as it were in triumph ouer the king, was gloriously remoued in sight

of the pepill into the Quenis a win lodging, and thare layed in a lower parlor directly vnder the chamber quhaire the Quene hir self lay sicke. Thare quhile thay baith were yet feebill & vnhealed, she of hir disease, and he of his wound, the Quene being very weake of hir body, yet visited him daily. And quhan thay were baith a littill recouered, and thair strengthes not yet fully settled, thay returned to thair auld pastime againe, and that so openly as thay semed to feare nathing mair than least thair wickednes should be vnknawen.
            About the v. day of Nouember, being remoued from Iedworth to a towne called Calco, thare she receaued letters from the king. Quhilk quhan she had red in presence of the Regent, the Erle of Huntley, and the Secretary, she cast a pitious luik, and miserably tormented hir selfe as if she wald haif by and by fallen down againe into hir former sicknes, & she plainly and expresly protested, that vnlesse she mought by some meane or vther be dispatched of the king, she should neuer haife ane gude day. And if by no vther way she cauld atteine it, rather than

she wald abide to liue in sic sorow, she wald slay hir selfe.
            Within few dayes after, quhile in hir returne through Marchelād she lay at Coldingham, Dame Rerese passed through the watch and was knawen and let goe. Quhat company she had, and whether she went at that time of night, it is nat vnknawen to the Quene. From thense about the end of Nouember she came to Cragmillar, a castell about twa miles from Edenburgh. Thare in presence of the Erle of Murray (quhilk afterward was Regent, and now is him selfe also slaine) and of the Erles of Huntley and Argyle, and the Secretarie, she fell into hir sayd former discourse, and also added the maist commodious way, as she thought, how it might be brought to passe, that is, to sue a diuorce against the king. And she douted not but it might easily be obteined, forasmuch as thay were the one to the vther in sic degrée of consanguinitie,Cosin germanes. as by the Popes law might not marry together, specially (quhilk was easie for hir to do) the Bull being conueyed away quhairby the same law was dispensed

with. Here quhen ane had cast a doubt, that if sche should goe that way to worke, thair sonne should be made a bastard, being borne out of lawfull wedlocke, specially sith neither of hys parentes were ignorant of the causes quhairby the mariage should be voide: this answer quhen sche had a quhile tossed in hir minde, and knew that he sayd trouth, and that sche durst nat as yit disclose hir purpose to make away hir sonne, sche gaue ouer that deuise of diuorce, and yit from that day forwart sche neuer cessed to pursue hir intentioun of murdering the king, as may easily be perceiuit by that quhilke followid.
            The King being returnid from Stereline to Cragmillar, quhen he hoipid to finde hir mair gentill towart him, and hir displeasure by processe of tyme somequhat appeasid, he so found na tokē of change of hir affectioun, that he was nat allowed any thyng for his dayly sustenance, vnlesse he kept him still at Stereline. Quhilk thing exceedingly encreased the pepils suspicioun, vtherwise of it selfe alredy enough inclined to that iudgement, of

the vnchast companiyng of the Quene with Bothwell
            About the beginning of December, quhen there wer Embassadours come out of France and England, to the Christening of the king that now is: that Bothwell might be gorgiously beséene amang the Nobilitie, sche hir selfe layed out the money to bye hym apparell, and sum sche baught hir selfe of the marchantes for him, and sche sa applied hir selfe with sic diligence in ouerseing the making therof, as if sche had bene, I will nat say his wife, but euen his seruaunt. In the meane time hir lawfull husband, at the Christening of his awn childe, nat onely wanted all hir maintenance for his necessary expensis, but also was cōmaundid nat ones to cum in the Embassadours sight, his ordinarie seruantis were remouid from him, the nobilitie weir enioynid nat ones to attend on him, nor to do him honor, nor in a maner to know him: the forren Ambassadouris wer warnid nat to talke wyth him, quhen yet the maist pairt of the day thay wer all in the same Castel quhere he was.
            
               The young gentleman thus contemptuously and vnkindly vsed, fell in sic despeire, that he departed from Stereline and went to Glascow to his father. At his departure the Quene still pursued him with hir wonted haitred. All his siluer plate quherewith he was serued from hys mariage tyll that day, sche tooke it away euery whit, and appointed pewter in the s
                  •
               eede thereof. But let this serue onely to proue hir contempt of him: the rest that followed are euident argumentes of outragious crueltie and vnappeasable haitrid. Ere he was passid a mile from Stereline, all the pairtes of his bodie wer taken with sic a sore ache, as it might easily appeare that the same proceded nat of the force of any sickenesse, but by playne trecherie. The tokens of quhilke trecherie, certayne blacke pimples sa soone as he was cum to Glascow, brake out ouer all his hole bodie, with sa great ache and sic peine throughout all his limmes, that he lingred out his life with very small hoipe of escape: and yet all this quhile the Quene wald nat suffir sa much as ane Phisitioun anes to cum at him.
            
               Efter the Ceremonies of the Christening ended, sche practisid with hir brother the Erle of Murray, that quhē he should go to cōduct the Erle of Bedford, the Quene of Inglādis Ambassador to S. Andrewes, he should require Bothwell also to beare him companie. Quho in deide frankly promised sa to do, howbeit baith he and the Quene the deuiser of that dissimulatioun, thoght nathing lesse, as the successe schewed. For sa soone as the king was gone to Glascow, and the rest towart S. Andrewes, sche with hir Bothwell got hir to Drumen, and from thence to Tylebarne. In quhilke housis they sa passid the time about viij. dayes, in euery corner, and in familiar haunting together, as all (sauing themselues alone that had throwē away all schame) wer hiely offended with their cōtempt and vile regard of publike fame, seing them now nat ones to séeke to couer thair filthy wickednesse.
            Quhen about the beginning of Ianuary thay wer returned to Stereline, sche begā to finde fault with the house quherein hir sonne was nursed, as incommodious becaus it stoode in a colde

and moyst place, dangerous for bringing the childe to a rewme. But it shall easily appeare that this was done for vther purpose, for as much as all these faultes that sche pretended baith weir nat in that house, and also wer in deid in the vther house to quhilke the childe was remeuid, beyng set in a low place and a very marishe. The childe being scarcely aboue vj. monethes olde, in the déepe of a sharpe winter, was conueyed to Edenburgh. There, because the first attempt preuailed nat, and the force of the poyson was ouercome by strength of nature, that at length yet sche might bring furth that qhuerwith sche had sa lang traueiled, sche entreth into new deuises for the murder of the King.
            Hir self goeth to Glascow, sche pretendeth the cause of hir iorney to be to sée the king aliue, quhoes deith sche had continually gapid for the whole moneth befoir. But quhat was in deid the trew caus of that iorney, ech man may plainely perceiue by hir letters to Bothwell. Being now out of care of hir sonne, quhom sche had in hir awne warde, bending hir selfe to the slaughter

of hir husband, to Glascow sche goeth, accompanied with the Hameltons and vther the kings naturall enemies.
            Bothwell, as it was betwene tham befoir accordid, prouideth all thyngis redy that were nedefull to accomplishe the haynous act, first of all a house nat commodious for a sick mā, nor comely for a king, for it was baith torne & ruinous, & had stand empty without any dweller for diuerse yeares befoir: in a place of small resort, betwene the auld fallen wallis of two Kirkes, neare a few almes houses for poore beggers. And that no commodious meane for committing that mischiefe might be wāting, there is a posterne dore in the towne wall hard by the house, quhereby thay might easily passe away into the fieldes. In chusing of the place sche walde needes haif it thoght that thay had respect to the holesomnes. And to auoyde suspicioun that this was a faynid pretence, hir selfe the two nightes next befoir the day of the murder, lay there in a lower roome vnder the kingis chamber. And as sche did curiously put of the shewes of suspicioun from hir selfe, sa the executiomn of the

slaughter sche was content to haue committed to vther.
            About thre deyes befoir yt the King was slaine, sche practisit to set hir brother Robart, and him at deadly feude, making reckening that it schould be gayne ta hir, quhilk sa euer of tham baith had perishit. For mater to groūd thayr dissentioun, sche made rehersall of the speach that the King had had with hir concerning her brother. And whan thay baith sa grew in talke, as the one seemed to charge the vther with the lye, at last thay were in a maner come from wordes to bloes. But while thay were baith laying thayr handes on thayr weapons, the Quene fayning as thogh sche had be perilouslously affrayit of that quhilk sche earnestly desirit, callith the Erle of Murray her vther brother to the parting, to this intent that sche might eyther presently bring him in danger to be slayne him self, or in time to come to bear the blaime of sic mischeife as than might haif happenit. Whan this way the successe fell nat out as sche desirit, sche deuisit a new way to transferre the suspicion from her self. While the Erle

of Murray dyd willinglye keipe himself from the Court, and had reasonable excuse for hys absence, for that his wife bying neir her time, was beside that alswa very sicke: at the same time thare was an Embassador come from the Duike of Sauoy. This the Quene tuke for a conuenient colour to sende for her brother: but the trew cause of hyr sendyng for hym was, that sche had a desire to throw the suspycioun of the Kyngis murder vpon hym, and vpon the Erle Moreton, and therwythall alswa at ones to procure the distructioun of those twa being men acceptable to the pepill and likely aduersaries to her practise quha entendyt to set vp a tyranicall regiment. But Gods gude clemēcy that oft befoir had deliuerit the Erle of Murray fra many tresons of hys enemeis, dyd than alswa manifestly succour hym: for vpon the sonday quhilk was the ix. day of Februarie, quhen he was going to the Kirk to ane sermon, a letter was brought him that hys wief was deliuerit afoir hyr time, and in veray small hoip of lief. Quhen he being dismayit with these soden newes, prayd leaue of

the Quene to depart, sche aunswerit, that gif the caas wer sa, it wer a superfluous iourney for hym to go to hyr, beyng nat abill to do hyr any gude in hyr sicknesse. But quhen he was styll mair importunate, sche prayit hym, that he wauld yit tary but that one night, and take hys iourney the next day to his wyfe. But the clemencie of God, as at many vther times, baith deliuerit the innocent gentleman fram present peril, and alswa tuke away the occasioun of sclaunder agaynst hym in time to com. Howbeit for al this thogh there were no cause of suspitioun, yit he eschaped nat free from sclander: for Huntley and Bothwell, though thay could nat iustly charge hym, yet laboured by infamous libelles quhilk thay spread abroad, to disteyne hym wyth the maist foule spotte of that schamfull act. And quhairas the murder was cō
               mitted after midnight, they had befoyr daylight caused by speciall forapointid messengers rumors to be spred in Ingland, that the Earles of Murray and Moreton were doers of that sclaughter. But that rumour, so soone as the light of the truth ones brake forth, sodenly

vanisched away, as vther falshodes are commonly wont to do.
            Quhen all thingis were redy preparit for perfourming this cruell fact, and yit all occasiouns cut of to diuert the blame thayrof, the partenaris of the conspyracie fearyng lest lang delay shauld eyther bryng some impediment to thair purpose, or disclose thayr counselles, determynit to dispatch it in hast. The Quene thairfoir, for manners sake after supper, goeth vp to the Kingis lodging. Thare, being determinit to shew him all the tokens of reconciled gude will, sche spent certaine houres in his company, with countenance and talke mikle mair familiar than she had vsid in sixe or seuen monethis befoyr. At the comming in of Paris sche brake of hir talk, & prepared to depart. This Paris was a yong man borne in France, & had liued certayne yeires in the houses of Bothwell, & Seton, & efterwart with the Quene. Quhairas the vther kayis of that lodging wair in custody of the Kingis seruants, Paris by fayning certayne fond and sclender causis, had in keipyng the keyis quhilk Bothwell kept backe, of the back gate

and the posterne. He was in specyall trust with Bothwell and the Quene, touchand thayr secrete affayres. His comming (as it was befoyr agreit emang tham) was a waitchword that all was ready for the matter. As sone as the quene saw hym, sche rose vp immediatly, and feyning an vther cause to depart, sche sayid, Alas I haif mikle offendit towart Sebastian this day that I come not in a maske at hys mariage. This Sebastian was an Aruernois, a man in greit fauour with the quene for his cunning in musike, and his mery iesting, and was maryit the same dey. The king thus left in maner alone in a desolate place, the quene departith accompanyit wyth the Erles of Argile, Huntley, and Cassilis, that attendit vpon hyr. Efter that sche was come into her chamber after midnicht, sche was in lang talke with Bothwell, none byeng present but the capitayne of her gard. And quhen he alswa withdrew him selfe, Bothwell was thare left alone without vther cumpany, and schortly efter retyred into hys awin chamber. He chainged hys apparell, because he wald be vnknawin of sic as

met hym: and put on ane lose cloke, sic as the Swartrytters weare, and sa went forwart thorow the watch to execute hys intendit trayterous fact. The whole order of the duyng thayrof, may be easely vnderstude by thayr confessions quhilk were put to deith for it.
            Bothwell efter the dede was ended that he wēt for, returned, & as if he had ben ignorant of al that was don, he got him to bed. The Quene in the meane time in greit expectation of the succes, how finely sche played hir part (as sche thoght) it is maruell to tell. For she nat anes stirred at the noise of ye fall of the house, quhilk shooke the hale towne, nor at the fearfull outcryis that followit, & confused cryes of the pepill, (for I thinke there happenit hir nat any new thyng vnlukit for) till Bothwell fayning hymselfe afrayde, rose agayn out of his bed and came to hir with the Erles of Argile, Huntley, and Athole, and with the wyues of the Erles of Athole and Murray, and with the Secretarie. There quhile the monstrous chaunce was in tellyng, quhile euery one wondered at the thyng, that the kyngis ladging was euin from the very

foundation blown vp into the ayre, & the kyng him self slayne: in this amasednesse & confusit feare of all sortes of persons, onely that same heroicall hart of the Quene, maintenit it selfe so far from castyng hir selfe downe into base lamentations and teares vnbesemyng the Royall name, blud, and estate, that she matched or rather farre surmounted all credit of the constancie of any in former tymes. This also proceded of the same nobilitie of courage, that she sēt out the mair part of tham that wer then about hir, to enquire out the maner of the doyng, and commandit the soldiars that watchit to follow, & she hir selfe settlit hir selfe to rest, with a countenance sa quyet, and mynde sa vntroublit, that she swéetely slept till the next day at noone. But least she should appere voide of all naturalnesse at the death of hir husband, by litil and litill at length she kept hir close, & proclamed a mournyng nat lāg to endure.
            The commoun pepill, nat certainly knawyng whether she laughed or lamented, wer diuided into sondry imaginations, sith it was perilous dealing with the disguising of the court, either

in knawyng it to seme to mock it, or in nat cunnyngly dissemblyng to seme to knaw it. Quhile some talked of one sorte, some of an vther, in the meane tyme of any inquirie to be had of the murder, there was na mention made at all. At length, the day followyng, at efternoone, quhen baith shame and feare constrainit them thereto, Bothwell the principall doer of the vyle act, with certaine vther that wer priuie to the same, assemblit together with the Erle of Argyle for that he is by inheritance the Iustice to deale with crimes punishable by death. First as though thay had bene vtterly ignorant of all that euer was done, thay begynne to wonder at the strangenesse of the mater, sic as neuer was heard of, and incredible. Then thay begyn to be busie a litill about thair inquirie, thay sent for a few poore silly women that dwelt there about. Quhilk poore saules standing in dout whether it wer better for tham to tell or hald thair peace, though thay deintily tempered thair spech, yet quhen thay had blabbed out somwhat mair then the iudges luked for, thay wer dismissed againe as fooles that had

but vndiscretly prated. For thair testimonies, though thay touched some folkes shrewdly, yet thay were sic as thay might easily set lyght by. Then were called and examined the kyngis seruantes that wer of hys houshold, sic as wer left vndestroyit with the cruell chaunce. Thay denyed that thay had the keyes in kepyng. Beyng examined quho had tham, thay sayd the quene. So the enquirie for maners sake was adiornit, but in dede suppressit, for feare least if thay proceded further, the secretes of the court might hap to be disclosed. Yet least the mater should seme nat to be regarded, out goeth a proclamatioun with rewardes promised to hym that could geue informatioun of it. But quho durst accuse the quene? or (quhilk was in maner mair perilous) quho durst detect Bothwell of sic a horrible offence: specially quhē he hym selfe was baith doer, iudge, inquirer, and examiner? Yet this feare quhilk stoppit the mouthes of euery man in particular, could nat restraine the hale multitude in generall. For baith by bukes set out, & by pictures, and by cryes in the darke night, it was

sa handelit, that the doers of the mischeuous fact might easily vnderstand that those secretes of thairs wer come abrode. And quhen euery man was now out of dout, quho dyd the murder, and quho gaue furtherance vnto it, the mair that thay labored to kepe thair own names vndisclosit, so much the peoples grudge restraynit brake out mair openly. Though thay tuke vpō tham as if thay regardit nat these thynges, yet sometyme the rumors sa nerely prickit them to the quick, that thay could by no meanes hyde thair anger. Thairfoir, discontinuyng thair searchyng for the kynges death, they begyn a new enquirie, farre mair earnest, against the authors of bukes, and the sclanderers of Bothwell as thay tham selues termed tham. These examinations wer sa rigorously put in excutioun, as nouther money, nor labor of men nor horses was spared about it. All the paynters were callit togither, all that earned thair liuing by writyng, wer assembled, to iudge of the pictures and bukes that had ben set out. And if ane painter had nat of hys awn accord confessit, that it was he of quhoes

worke thay inquirit, an vther that was not gilty therof, but touchit a litill with a slight suspicioun, had suffred for it. There was published a proclamatioun agreable with the maner of the Inquisition, quhairin it was made death, nat onely to set out any sic mater, but also to rede it beyng set out by ane vther. But these persones that with thretenyng of death practised to stoppe the speche of the pepill, yet nat satisfiit with maist cruell murder of the king, cessit nat thair hatrit against him quhē he was dead. All hys gudes, armure, horses, apparell, & vther furniture of his house, the quene diuidit, some to tham that slew hym, and some to hys fathers auncient deadly foes, as if thay had vpon atteinder come to hir by forfaiture: and hys fathers tenantes, as though thay had ben alswa part of hir conquerit booty, she sa scraped till she brought tham in a maner to extreme beggerie.
            But this was a strange example of crueltie and sic as neuer was heard of befoir, that as she had satisfied her heart with hys slaughter, sa she wold nedes fede hir eyes with the sight of

hys bodie slayne. For she lang beheld, nat onely without grefe, but alswa with gredy eyes, hys dead corps, the gudlyest corps of any gentleman that euer liued in this age. And than sodenly, without any funerall honor, in the night tyme, by commoun carriers of dead bodies, vpon a vile béere, she causit hym to be buryed hard by Dauid Rizo. Quhen these doynges were knawin abrode, and that the indignatioun of the pepill had ouercome the threatnynges of penalties, and the frāknesse of sorrow surmounted feare, by litill and litill she beganne to set hir face, and with counterfaiting of mournyng she labored to appease the hartes of the grudgyng pepill. For quhair the auncient maner hath ben for quenis efter the death of thair husbandes, by the space of fortye dayes, not onely to forbeare the companie of men, but alswa from lukyng on the open light, she attemptit a disguisit maner of mournyng. But the myrth of heart far passing the fayned sorrow, she shut the dores in dede but she set open the windowes, and within fower dayes she threw away hir wayling wéede, and

gane to behald baith sunne and open skye agayne. But this ane thyng fell very ouerthwartly. For quhen Henry Killegrée, was come from the quene of Ingland to comfort her, as the maner is, this gentleman strangeris hap was to marre the play and vnuisor all the disguising. For quhen he was, by the quenis commaundement come to the Court, though he beyng an auld courtier and a gud discrete gentleman, did nathyng hastily, yet he came in sa vnseasonably ere the stage wer prepared and furnished, that he found the windowes open, the candeles nat yet lighted, and all the prouision for the play out of order. Quhen of the forty dayes that are apoyntit for the mournyng, scarce twelue wer yet fully past, and the counterfaityng wald nat frame half handsomely, & to disclose hir true affections so soone she was somewhat ashamit, at length takyng hart of grace vnto hir, and neglectyng sic trifles, she commeth to her own byace, and openly sheweth hir owne naturall conditions. She posteth to Setons house, with a very few and those not all of the saddest company. There Bothwel,

though it semed that for the great fauor he than had in court, and for the nobilitie of hys byrth, & other respectes of honor, he should haue ben, next efter the quene, most honorably receiued, yet was ludged in a chamber hard by the kitchin. Howbeit the same was a place not altogether vnfit to asswage thair sorrowes, for it was directly vnder the quenis chamber: and if any sodein qualme of grefe should haue hapned to come ouer hir hart, there was a paire of stayres, though somewhat narrow, yet wyde enough for Bothwell to get vp to comfort hir.
            In the meane tyme, efter the rumor hereof was spred into France, Monsieur de Croc, quho had often befoir ben Embassadour in Scotland, came in sodenly vpon tham, God wote full vnseasonably. By hys aduise she returned to Edenburgh, out of that denne quhilk euen as far as France was infamous. But in Setons house were sa many commodious opportunities for hir purpose, that how soeuer hir gud name wer therby appeyred, nedes she must ga thether agayne. There were conselles holden of the great affaires

of the realme. The end of the consultatioun was, that Bothwell shold be arrainit of the murder, and acquitit by iudges therto chosen for the nones and constrainit. It was concludit, that the meaner sorte of the iudges might with fauor and fayre promises. be ledde, and the rest of the greater and grauer sort (whom for fashions sake thay were driuen to call to the mater) might be drawen with feare to acquite hym. For byside libelles therof commonly throwen abrode, the kyngis father the Erle of Lennor did openly accuse hym for principall author of the murder.
            The assemblie of the states in parlament was at hand, quhilk was to be halden the xiij. of Aprill, befoir quhilk day thay wald nedes haue the arrainement dispatchit. That great hast was the cause, quhy in that preceding and triall nathyng hes ben done according to the forme of law, nathing in order, nathing after the auncient vsage. There ought to haue bene publike summons of the accusers, the next of the kinne, the wife, the father, and the sonne, eyther to be present thamselfis,

or to send thair proctors. The law also gaue tham tyme of forty dayes. But hair the father was commaundit to cum within xiij. dayes, and that wythout any assembly of his frendis, wyth hys awne housholde retinue anely, quhilk by reason of his great pouertie was now brought to a few: quhile in the meane tyme Bothwell with great bandes of men, dayly mustered about the towne. And bycause he verely beleuit that in sa assurit perill na man would take vpon hym to be hys accuser, he grew to sic ane negligence, and sic contempt of law and iudiciall procedyng,Enditement. that the dictay was framit of ane murder supposit to be done the ix. day of February, quhen in dede the Kyng was slayne the x. day. In choosing and refusing of the Iudges, the lyke seueritie was vsid, for the murderers tham selfis made the choise of the Iudges▪ quhen there was na man to take exceptioun against tham. The Erle of Cassiles, willing raither to pay hys amercemēt as the maner is, than to be a Iudge in the matter, quhen he had stoode in it a quhile and wald nat appeare at the Quenis request & manacing,

yea though sche sent hir ring for credit baith of hir earnest prayer and threatning, at length constraynit with feare of exile and punitioun, he yelded. There sate the Iudges, nat chosin to iudge, but piked out to acquite: the cause procedit wythout any aduersarie: a triall in a matter of life & deith, quhen there was neuer ane accuser, but suborned by the partie accused: so as a man might well thinke it not the triall of a cause in a court but the playing of ane enterlude vpon a stage. In all this recklesnesse of all thinges, yet behald I pray you of quhat force is the testimony of conscience on either side. Sodenly, vnluked for, there starteth vp a youngman of the Erle of Lennor house, in quhame the respect of dutie vanquishit the feare of danger. This youngman made ane open protestatioun that the same assembly of Iudges was nat lawfull, bycause in thair proceding there was nathing done according to law nor order. At thys saying the Iudges were all striken in sic a feare, that thay all by and by with one mouth made protestatioun, with promise that it should nat hereafter be preiudiciall

to tham, in that thay acquited a prisoner quhame na man accused, and that thay had acquitit him of a murder allegit to be committit the ix. day of February quhen the kyng was slayne the x. day. This is that saim nobill triall and iudgement, quhairby Bothwell was, not cleansed of the crime, but as it weir washed with sowters blacking, and sa mair comely prepared to goe a wooing to wed the Quene, and sa to become a husband to hir greater schame than he was befoir an adulterer. To make vp yet the full perfectioun and encrease of this iolly acquitall, there was set vp a writyng in the most notorious place of the court, that though Bothwell had by iust triall and iudgement bene lawfully cleansed and acquitit of the murder quhairof he had ben falsely accusit, yet for mair manifest declaratioun of his innocēcie to the hale world, he was redy to trie it in combat, if any man of gude fame and a gentilman borne would charge him with the murder of the king. The next day after, there was ane that set vp a bill in open place, and offred to accept the

combat, sa that there might for the battell be sic a place appointed, quhairin the partie mought safely without feare disclose his name.
            Quhile maters and mens affections were in this styrre, the parlament assembled. There after thay had for viij. dayes together, in maner done nathing but treated of reuersing ye iugement, quhairby the Erle Huntleyes father had ben attaintit of treason, & for restoryng the sonne to hys fathers possessions and honors: there were alswa certaine plausible thyngis grauntit to please the pepill, and specially for the Kirke, namely the repellyng of certain lawes of popish tyrannie made for punisching of sic as durst ones mutter agaynst the decrées of the sée of Rome. Though these thingis were acceptable among the commonaltie, yet there remainit ane thyng quhilk na lesse vexed the quene thē offended the pepil, that is to say, hir cōpanieng with Bothwel, not altogether sa openly as she wald faine haue had it, and yet not sa secretly but that the pepill perceiuit it, for that all mens eyes were gazyng vpō tham. For quhairas Bothwel had

a wife of his owne, & to tarry for a diuorce was thoght an ouerlang delay, and in the meane time the quene could nouther openly auow to haue him, nor secretly enioy hym, and yit in no wise could be without hym, some shift, though nat an honest ane, yit a shift forsothe, must be deuised. And quhen thay could nat thinke vpon a better, it semit tham a maruelous fine inuentioun god wote, that Bothwell should rauishe and take away the Quene by force, and sa saue hir honour. Sa within a few daies after, as the quene was returning from Stereline, Bothwell forceably toke hir by the way and cariit hir to Dunbarre: whether with hir will, or agaynst hir will, euery man may easily perceiue by hir awin letters that sche wrote to him by the way as sche was in hir iourney. But howsoeuer it weir, that the wrong of the rauishment might be defaced with honest colour of mariage, Bothwels wife was compelled, in twa courtis to sue a diuorce against hir husband.
            Befoir Iudges delegate appointit by the quenis authorifie to haif iurisdictioun in sic causis, the wife accuseth

the husband of adulterie, quhilke with tham was a iust cause of diuorce. Befoir Popishe Iudges quho in deed by law weir forbidden, yet by speciall dispensatioun of the Bischop of S. Andrew, weir for the hearing of this cause anely permitted, Bothwell was accusit, that befoir his mariage with hys wife, he had committit fornicatioun with his wiues neare kinswoman: howbeit all this quhile thay kept close the Popis Bull by quilk the same offence was dispensit with. The diuorce was posted forwart without any slacknes either in the witnesses or in the Iudges. Within the space of x. dayes, the matter was taken in hand, began▪ and intented, ioynit vnto, tryit and iudged befoir baith the companies of Iudges. Quhen the sentence of diuorce was geuen and sent to Dunbar, Bothwell by and by assembleth together frō all pairtes, all his friendis, his seruantis, and reteiners, to conuey to Edenburgh the quene, quho wauld then nedes take vpon hir to be a prisoner. Quhen thay weir thus gatherid together, the maist pairt of tham in armour, by the way as thay weir conducting

the quene, many of tham weir sodenly striken in some feare, least in time to cum they might be chargit for halding the quene as prisoner, and that though there were none vther euidence, yet this ane thing would be profe enough against tham, that in time of peace thay were found armid about hir. Quhile thay were in thys doubt, in the middest of thair iorney thay all threw away thair launces, and in mair peasabill array, at least in schew, thay conueyed hir to the castell of Edenburgh, quhilke castell was also the same tyme at Bothwelles commaundement. There sche taried with Bothwell, quhile the banes weir publishing. Then sche came downe out of the Castell into the towne, to the commoun assembly of the Iudges, and there pronouncit hir selfe to be frée and at hir awne libertie. And sa at length within viij. dayes sche finished that vnmatrimoniall matrimonie, all gude men sa farre detesting or at least grudgingly foreiudging the vnlucky end thereof, that Monsieur do Croc the French kinges Embassadour, a mā very well affectionit to the quene,

ane of the factioun of the house of Guise, and soiorning very neare to the place, though he were earnestly required, yet thoght he could nat wyth his honor be present at the feast.
            These thyngis wer done about the xv. of May, in the yere. 1567. The xv. day of Iune followyng, Bothwell beyng either dismayed with gilty conscience of the vile fact, or sent away by the quene, she came her selfe to the Lordes of the realme, quho earnestly requirit the publike kyng murderer to be brought forth to due executioun. Quhat hath sins ben done, perteineth nat much to this present mater. And though my spech haue perhappes ben langer than you luked for, yet I playnly perceiue in my selfe, that quhile I seke to make end of my tale, many thyngis I haue omittit, and many thyngis for hast I haue but lightly touchit, and nathing haue I accordyng to the haynousnesse of the offense fully expressit.
         
         
            
            Ane oratioun, with declaration of euidence against Marie the Scotishe Quene quhairin is by necessarie argumentis plainely prouit that sche was giltie and priuie of the sayde murder.
            SIth these thingis are by writings and witnesses sa prouaible, and stick sa fast emprimtit in the knaledge of all the pepill, that sic as wald maist haue thaim hidden, yet can nat deny thaim: quhat plaice is here left for cunning, or quhat neid can be of diligence, to preue or repreue a thing sa plaine and euident? For all thingis are sa cleir, sa manifest, and sa mutually knit together, ech pairt to strengthen vther, that there is na neid of foreine probations, and all thingis sa fully witnessit, that there is na necessitie of vther argumentis. For if any will aske me, as in vther matters is wont to be askit, the causes of sa fowle a fact, I might alswa likewise aske of hym, sith the time, the plaice, the deede, and the autor is sufficiently knawen, to quhat purpose is it to stand vpon searching the causes, or to enquire by quhat meanes it was atcheuit? Agayne quhen there be extant sa many causes of hatrit,

and sa many taikens thereof do offer thamselues to knawlege, as may well be able to bryng euin thyngis vncertain to be beleuit, surely sa farre fet an explicatioun of the act committed may right well seme superfluous. Nat the lesse, for as mikle as sa great is the impudence of the vile offenders in denyeng, & sa confident the boldnesse of impudent persones in lyeng, let vs assay to see with quhat wepons truth is able to defend innocencie agaynst those wickit monsters. If than thay demand the cause of sa haynous a dede, I answere, it was vnappeasable hatrit. I demand of tham agayne if thay can denye that sic hatrit was, or that the same hatrit was sa great as without blud cauld nat be satisfiet? If thay denie that sic hatrit was, than let tham answere me, why she a yong woman, riche, noble, and finally a Quene, thrust away from hir in maner into exile the yong gentleman, beautifull, nere of hir kin; of the blud royall, and (that maist is) entierly louyng hir, in depe of sharp wynter, into places nouther frutefull of thyngis necessarie, nor replenished with inhabitantes, and cōmōly perilous with haunt of theifes? why sent she him away into desert and barren craggy mountaines, without prouision, into open periles, and in maner without any cōpanie? Quhat wald

she els haue haue done if she had maist dedly haitit hym, & couaitit to haue him dispatchit? But I trow she feared na sic thyng. But that voydenesse of feare, I construe to be a note of maist obstinate haitrit, specially sithe she baith knew the places and was nat ignorant of the dangers. That husband thairfoir, to quhom she was but laitely weddit, against the liking of hir subiectes, against the will of the freindis on baith sides, without quhom sche cauld nat endure, quhom sche scarcely durst suffer out of her sight, hym I say she thrusteth forth to vncertaine death and maist certaine perils.
            Will ye aske of me the causes of the chainge of her affectioun? quhat if I say I ken tham nat? it sufficeth for my purpose to proue that sche haitit hym. What if I aske agayne, why sche sa extremely loued the yongman quhom she neuer saw befoir? quhy she sa hastily maried him, and so vnmeasurably honorit him? Sic are the natures of some wemen, specially sic as can nat bruike the greatnesse of thair awne gud fortune: thay haue vehement affections baith wayes, thay loue with excesse, and hait without measure, and to quhat side sa euer thay bend, thay are not gouerned by aduised reason, but carried by violent motion. I cauld out of the monumentes

of antiquitie rehearse innumerable examples, but of hir selfe I had raithest beleue hir selfe.
            Call to minde that part of hir letters to Bothwell quhairin sche maketh hir selfe Medea, that is, a woman that nouther in loue nor in hatrit can kepe any meane. I could alswa allege vther causes of hir hatrit, although in dede nat reasonable causes, yet sic as are able to shooue forwart and to push hedlang a hart for outrage nat able to gouerne it selfe. But herein I will forbeare. And, if hir selfe will suffer me, howsoeuer she hath deseruit of hir subiects, yit sa much as the cōmoun cause wil permit, I will spare her honor, yea I will spare it mair than the cause will allow me. I omit thairfoir hir vther causes of hatrit, and returne to this, that she hatit and nat meanely hatit hym.
            Wil ye see alswa an vther profe of hir hatrit? The tēder wife forsoth so louing and fond of hym, quhen she could nat do him the dutie of a wife, offreth to do him the seruice of a bawde. Hir owne brothers wife she made choise of, to put to hym in hir place. Quhat shal we thinke to be the cause of this sa sodein change? Sche that quhilere gapingly sought for euery small breath of suspicioun against hir husband, and quhaire trew causes weir nat to be found, sche inuentit sic as

weir manifestly false, and this sche curiously did, nat quhen sche louid hym, but quhen sche had begon to hate hym, and quhile sche was fisching for occasions to be diuorced from him, euen sche I say now of hir awne accorde offreth him a louer, declaireth hir awne contentatioun therewith, and promiseth hir furtherance. Quhat can we imagine to be the cause hereof? Was it to pleasure hir husband? no, for sche hatit him, and although sche louid him, yet sic maner of doing in a woman is vncredible. Was it that he knawing himselfe likewise gilty of adulterie on his pairt, might the maire willingly beare with a partner in vse of his wife? No, for he bare withall perforce against his wyll. Was it to finde cause of diuorce, and sa to driue him to leaue his bed empty for Bothwell? Yea, that was it in deede that sche sought for, but yet nat that alone. For in this woman ye must imagine na single mischefe. Sche hatit the Erle Murrays wief, euin with sic hatrit as all vnhonest persons hait the honest. The difference of thair twa fames mikle vexit hir, & thairwithal alswa she couitit to set the gud ladies husband & the king together by the eares, & sa rid hir selfe of twa combrances at ones. Thus see you how many and how greit thingis sche practisit to dispatch with ane labour.

Hir paramors enemie, the bridler of hir licentiousnes, & hir awne hatit husband she hopith to rid all at ones, quhile by sa sondry sortes of wickit doynges she maketh hast to hir maist wickit weddyng.
            Quhairto tended that fearefull hasty callyng for the Erle Murray at midnight? Cauld she nat tarrie til day light? quhat was the occasioun of sa sodeine feare? The gude woman, God wote, carefull for cōcord of the nobilitie, derely louyng hir brother, and maist derely louing hir husband, was afrayd forsoth, least hir brother shold in the night haif ben assaltit by the kyng, quhom she hir selfe had disarmit? disarmit, sayd I? Yea she had disfurnished him of all conuenient companie for his estate, & made hym be shaken vp with womens scoldyng, & that by one of hir awne traine, one past all shame and of prostitute vnchastitie. She feared perdie, least the yongman, destitute of all freindes, beset with all sortes of miseries, shold make assalt in the night tyme. Upon quhat person? the Quenis brother, a man of a great reputatioun and power, and in hyest fauour with all estates. And quhair should he haue assailit him? in a maist strong castell, quhair vpon the dede done nouther was issue for him to flee, nor meane of refuge to the Quenis mercie. For quhat cause shold he assaile hym? There was

no enimitie betwene tham but sic as she had sowed. Quhat say you, if she couetit that thyng maist quhilk she most faynit hir selfe to feare? For to quhat purpose ells sent she for hir brother to come to hir in the night tyme, vnarmed? Why dyd she nat aduise him of this one thyng at least, that because he was to passe by, and hard by the kyngis dore, he shold in any wise put on his armour? Why did she nat either forewarne hym of the danger, or differre the callyng of him till the next morning? Na na, she had a far vther purpose in hād. She had but newly sent the kyng away, inflamed (as she hopit) with hatrit of the Erle Murray. So thoght she it nat vnlikely but that the kyng, kindlit with fresh displeasure, rash by feruor of youth, lightly beleuing hir by excesse of loue, wald haue aduenturit to slay his supposed enemie, nakit, vnaccompanied and vnarmit. So sent she the king ragyng in anger to commit the slaughter, and practisit to draw the Erle Murray nakit, vnaccompanied, vnwarnit, to be sodenly trappit in treason. This was hir meanyng, this was hir desire. But wickit counsells, how suttle soeuer they be, are nat alway prosperous.
            What meant this, that after hir deliuerance of childe, at quhilk time vther women do cheifly comfort tham selues

in the louingnes of thayr husbandes, & confes that thay finde some ease of paine by sight of tham, sche at the same time driueth her husband away? Quhat els shall we say sche meant thareby, but as the Poet sayth, for pure loue God wot, she shut him out of dores. But this tender creature, that eyther shutteth out hir husband, or assone as he is come chaceth him away agayne, whoes stomach turnit at the sight of hym, quho is sodenly taken with pangis at hys presence, quhen sche was in the pynnesse amang pyrates and theefis, sche could abide at the powpe, and ioyit to handle the boysterous cables. Now aske I quhame sche loued, and quham sche haytit. For that at Aloe sche droue away the combersome interrupter of her pastime, that agayne quhen he came to hir to Edenburgh, sche reiected him, I blame hyr nat. I am content to beleif sche did it nat for hate to hir husband, but for hyr fansies sake. That agayne at Iedworth sche suffrit him nat to come at hir, let it be borne withall: For nat without cause sche fearit lest the force of hyr sicknesse wauld encrease at sight of him, whoes deith sche sa earnestly desyrit. That sche gaif speciall commaundement that na man shauld lodge him, na man shauld relieue him with meat or drincke, that sche in maner forbad him the vse of fyre

and water: thys is vndoubtedly a token of outragious haytrit. But it seemeth sche fearit the veray infectioun of hir husband, if he wer in any place neir hyr. That sche sent hym backe from Cragmillar to Stereline, I complayne nat. But that sche bereued him of all his necessaries, that sche tuke from him hys seruauntes, that sche abatit the allowance for hys expensis, that sche alienit the nobilitie from hym, that sche forbad strangeris the sight of him, and (as much as in hyr lay) tuke from him euen quhile he liued, the vse of heauen, earth, and ayre: thys, I say, I doubt quhat to call it, vnnaturalnesse, hatreit, barbarous fiercenesse, or outragious crueltie? That quhen he went from Stereline sche tuke away all his plate, let it be pardoned, for what need had he of siluer, that caryit with him present deith in his bosome? But this this I besech you consider how greit indignatioun of all men it hath kindlit, that quhen the King pure saule hardly shiftit wyth lief in desolatioun, in sorrow, and in beggery, in the mean time Bothwell, as an Ape in purple, was triumphantly shewed to the Embassadoris of foreine natiounis, euin that saim partener of hyr husbandes bed, nat sa mikle for loue of him selfe, as for despite of hyr husband, was caryit abroad, set out with

all kindes of ornamentes, euen that adulterous partener I say, that neyther in byrth, nor in beautie, nor in any honest qualitie was in any wise comparable with hyr disdayned husband. Now let tham denay that here were tokens of hatreyt.
            But how great and how vnappeasable this haitrit was, euen by this ye may gather. Hir husband sa oft shut out, sa oft sent away with dispite, driuin to extreme pouertie, banisched into a desolate corner, farre from the court, farre from presence of men, spoyled of hys seruantis and furniture of housshold, bereuit in a manir of his daily necessary sustenance, yet by na iniuries can be shaken from hir, by na feare of deith can be withdrawen, but with seruiceablenesse and patience he assayeth, if nat to ouercome, yit at least sumwhat to asswage the violent crueltie of hir vnkind courage. In the meane tyme quhat doth this gude gentill wife, this mercyfull Quene, that is at beholding of mēs miseries sa kinde and pitifull? Neither is sche anes mouit with the louing doingis, nor with the wretched plight, nor with the miserabill wofulnesse of hir husband, nor appeasit by tyme, nor satisfy it with tormentis, but rathir wyth his seruiceablenesse sche is irritatit, with hys humble prayers sche is mair inflamit,

& at euery tyme of his comming she deuiseth some new encrease of spitefull dishonor. Quhairin quhen she had spent the vttermaist of all hir force, of witte, & bitternes of nature, quhen sche saw the poore yong gentilman, neyther to geue ouir by faintyng, beyng oppressit with pouertie, and though he weir despisit of all men, and sa oft throwen into opin perillis, neyther to despeire nor vtherwise mair cruelly to misdoe to himselfe, at length as it weir gluttit with sight of his miseries and tormentis, sche determinit presently to ridde him of hys calamities, hir selfe of irksomnesse, and hir adulterer from feare, and sa by certayne speciall personis thereto appointit, sche causit hym to be poysonit, that being absent from hir, he might sa die wyth lesse suspitioun. But of the poyson I wyll say mair in an vther place.
            Quhen this practise framit nat fully to hir desire, sche goeth hir selfe to Glascow, that quhom being absent she could nat kill, sche might hir selfe in presence satisfie baith hir cruell hart and hir eyes with sight of hys present miseries. And as if hir selfe alone weir nat sufficient to execute the cruell tormenting of hym, sche bringeth into his sight the ministers of hir haynous doinges, and hys auncient naturall enemies, and wyth these outragis trauailed to vexe hys

saule at his last breath. But quhairto gather we argumentis as in a doubtfull case, quhen sche hir selfe will nat suffir vs to doubt at all? sche the Quene hir selfe I say opinly protestit, nat to hir louer in bed, nat amang hir confederatis in secret chamber, nat befoir few and meane personis, of estait apt to flatterie, constraynit by pouertie, or of purpose affectionit, sche hir selfe I say opinly confessit, that sche could nat liue ane gude day if sche weir nat ridde of the kyng: and that nat ones, nor vnaduisedly, but in presence of those personagis quhome sche vsit to call to counsell in the weightiest affaires. For it can nat be sayd vnaduisedly slipped from hir that was sa oft spoken, in sa many, sa farre distant placis, with tearis alswa addit to moue credit, befoir men notabill, baith for their nobilitie, wealth, & wisdome, and quhairin sche declairit hir awne opinioun, practisit to winne thair assent, and harkenit for thair aduises. But be it that she forgid al these things, be it that hir tearis weir faynit, let thaim nat beleue it that heard it, let the greatnes of the outrage make the report vncredibill. I my selfe alswa would gladly be ane of that number, to thinke these thingis vtterit by hir rathir to groape the myndis of vther, than that she hir self sa thoght in hir hart, if it weir

nat sa that the thing it selfe confirmeth the report, that the outragiousnesse of the doingis farre surmounteth all bitternesse of vtterance.
            Quhen he was preparing to depart from Glascow, sche causit poyson to be geuen hym. You will aske, by quhom? in quhat maner? quhat kind of poyson? quhair had sche it? Aske you these questions? as though wickit Princis euer wantit ministeris of thayr wyckit treachereis. But still you presse me perhaps and still you aske me who be theis ministeris? Fyrst that poysoned he was, it is certeinly knawin: for though the schamlesnesse of men wald nat sticke to denay a thyng sa manifest, yit the kinde of disease, strange, vnknawin to the pepill, vnacquainted to phisitiones, specially sic as had nat bene in Italy and Spayne, blacke pimples breaking out ouer all his body, greuous ache in all his limbes, & intollerable stinch, disclose it. If thys cause wer to be pleaded befoir graue Cato the Censor, all thys were easie for vs to proue befoyr hym that was perswadit, that there is na adulteresse, but the saim is alswa a poysoner. Need we seek for a mair substantial witnesse then Cato, euery of whoes sentences antiquitie esteemed as sa many oracles? schall we nat in a manifest thing beleue him whoes credite hath in

thingis doutfull sa oft preuayled? Loe here a man of singular vprightnes, and of maist notable faythfulnes and credite beareth witnesse, agaynst a womā burnyng in hatrit of hir husband, & in loue of ane adulter, and in baith theis diseasis of corrupt affectiounis vnbridelit, vntemperable by her estayt, raging by hyr power, and indulgently following the wantonnes of hyr wealth. But let vs omit auld and dissused thingis, and let vs seuer the credite of inconstaunt multitude from the case of Princes. Let vs in sa greit a mater admit no witnesse in quhom eyther hys estait may be suspectit, or his manners may be blamit. Quhat witnessis than schall we vse? for by thys conditioun, we may bring forth none vnder the royall degree of a King or a Quene. But sic vile actis are nat wont to be committit by noble and gud men, but by leud and wickit ministeris. Howbeit that herin alswa the maist precise may be satisfyit, go to, let vs bring forth a royall witnesse. Read her awin letter, her letter (I say) written with her awin hand. What mean theis wordes, He is nat mikle deformit, and yit he hes receiuit mikle. Quairof baith he receauit mikle? The thing it selfe, the disease, the pimples, the sauour do tel you. Euin that perdy he receauit, that broght deformitie, forsoth veray poyson. But

her letters name not poyson. Thys is sufficient for me that is thare sayit, that though he receauit mikle, he is nat mikle deformit, or, though he be nat mikle deformit, yit he receauit mikle. Quhat meaneth this word Yit? quhat els but this, that quhat sa euer it was that he receauit, the saim was the cause of hys deformitie, quhilk though it were mikle, yit was it nat mikle enough to worke sic deformitie as was desyrit. But be it, it wer not poyson. What then was it els? You can finde na thing that can with conuenience of reason be named in place of it. Finally quhat sa euer it be that is meant by thys worde mikle, it is sic, as sche hyr selfe in sa secreit and familiar a letter dare not call by the right name. Yea and though we wald schyft it of by cauillous expounding, yit sche hyr selfe will nat suffer vs. Compare that quhilk went befoir with that quhilk foloweth, and by hyr deuise and purpose for tyme to come, ye schall easely vnderstand quhat it is that sche hath done in time past. First sche sayth it is needfull that he be purged, then sche determineth to cary him to Cragmillar, quhaire baith the phisitions, and (quhilk is mair dangerous than any phisition) sche hyr selfe may be presēt. Finally she asketh counsell of Bothwell, quhether he can deuise any secreter way by medicince, and that

at Cragmillar, & after a bath. See how all thingis hang together. He haith receuit mikle, he must be purged, and at Cragmillar, that is, in a desolate corner, in a place by reason of smale resorte very apt for a mischief to be committed. And Medicine he must vse, and quhat forsooth? euen the same quhairof he had befoir receauit mikle. How schall that appeare? Sche wil haue the maner of ministring the medicine to be secret. If it be to heal him, quhat need that secrecie? quhy is it nat ministrit openly and in a notorious peoplid place? Now he is eased of hys sickenesse, lusty and healthy, why is he purged in an vnusuall maner and an vnhaunted corner? But perhaps it was a strange kynde of disease, it had nede of strange remedies. Quhat Phisicions then called she to counsell? to quhom is this charge committit to seke out a new medicine and curyng for the kyng? Forsothe to the kyngis enemie, to the Quenis adulterer, the vilest of all twa-footit beastes, quhoes house was in France defamit of poisonyng, & quhoes seruantis wer there for the same cause, some torturit, some emprisonit, and all suspectit. Quhen was he pointed to receiue this noble medicine? either at hys bathyng quhair he should wash alone, or after his bathyng quhair he should suppe alone. So forsothe are medicines

accustomit to be prouidit by enemies, in secret place, without witnesses. That thairfoir quhilk an adulterer, an adultresse, and the partener of his wiues bodie, curiously prepareth, and secretly ministreth: quhat kynde of medicine it is, let eche man with hym selfe weye and consider. By this tyme I suppose you see▪ the hatrit of the Quene, how vnappeasable, how outragiously cruell, how obstinate it was agaynst hir husband, quhom she thrust amōg theiues, quhom she practisit to match in feude and battail with the nobilitie and with hir brethren, quhom nakit & poore, loden with dispites, vexit with raylinges, assailit with poisoun, she droue away into solitarie corner there to dye with extremest torment. Now let vs procede to the vther causes.
            This hatrit it self was of it self sufficiēt to pricke hir forwart to hir enemies slaughter, often sought, ones attemptit, and almost atcheued. Yet was there besides, ane stronger enforcement, able to enflame hir hatrit it selfe, I meane the loue quhairwith she intemperately fansied Bothwel: Quhilk loue quhosoeuer saw nat, and yet hath seen him, wil perhaps thinke it vncredible. For quhat was there in hym, that was of a womā of any honest countenance to be desired? Was there any gift of eloquēce? or grace

of beautie? or vertue of mynde, garnishit with the benefites quhilk we call of fortune? As for his eloquence and beautie, we nede not make lang tale of tham, sithe baith thay that haue sene hym can well remember hys countenance, his gate, and the hale forme of his bodie, how gay it was: thay that haue heard hym are not ignorant of his rude vtterance and blockishnesse. But, ye will say, he was in executyng attemptes, wise and politike: in auenturyng of periles, hardy and valiant: in franke geuyng, liberall: in vse of pleasures, temperant. For wisedome, cuin thay that be maist affectionate vnto him, dare nat charge him with it. Of valiantnesse in dede he laborit to winne some estimatioun, but among horsemen, on a swift stede well mountit, well prouidit for his awne safetie, a beholder of vther mens fighting, sometime hardly chacing tham that fled, but his enemies face towart him nere hand he neuer durst abide. Wil ye haue an example of his excellent valiantnesse? Of a theife, a notable cowart, quhom beyng yelded and vnware he had deadly woundit he was throwen downe to the ground, hurt, brusit with drye strokes, and had ben starke slayne if the poore theifes strength beyng redy to dye had nat fayled hym. I cauld rehearse hys glorious vayne braggeries

in France, I cauld tell of his last fearefull flight as far as to Denmark. But I had rathest rubbe vp the remembrance of that day quhen the Quene forsakyng him, came to the nobilitie that protestit to reuenge the slaughter of the kyng. The armyes stode redy in array, Bothwell in number of men was equall, in place had the auantage: there stode befoir him to be his reward beyng vanquisher, a Quene maist fansiefully louing him, a kyngdome, wealth, and honor, for him and his posteritie, mairouer impunitie for his offenses passit, extreme libertie to do quhat he list in tyme to come, abilitie to auance his freindes and be reuenged on his enemies, and on the vther side if he were vanquishit, dishonor, pouertie, and banishment, finally all thingis that thereafter happenit or hereafter may happen weir then befoir his eyes. There weir also present beside the twa armies, beholders and witnesses of ech mans valiance and cowardice, the Quene the price of the battayle, and Monseur de Croc the Embassadour of France. Now you luke to heare how this magnificall boaster of valiantnesse did acquit hymselfe. First, mountit vpon an excellent horse, he came brauely fourth befoir the armye. There the man forsoth very sparing of hys countrimēs

blude, and lauishe of his awne, calleth for ane to trie it wyth hym by combat man to man. And quhen there weir many on the vther side of honorabill birth and estaites, that offrid to accept the cumbat, by and by his violent heate cooled, and his glorious speche quaylit: and had it nat bene that the Quene, as it weir some God out of a ginne in a tragedie, had by hir auchoritie taken vp the mattir, and forbidden hir prety venereous pigioun to do battaile, he had fayled to finde nat onely a meane but alswa an honest colour to refuse to fight. And sa the combat interruptit, yit in the ioynit battayle he valiantly behauit hym. Farsoth the first man, almost at the beginning, and alone, he ranne hys way, and sa at length drew the rest of his pairt to flee after hym.
            But his defaultes in martiall feates, parhappes the man supplied with ciuile vertues. Alas quhat weir thay? or quhat vertues coulde be luked for in him? a man perdie broght vp in the byschop of Murrayes palace, to wite, a maist wickit corruptit house, in dronckennes and horedomes, amanst maist vile ministeries of dissolute misorder. After that he was growen towart mās estait
                  •
               
               ▪ at dice and amang harlottes he so wast it a maist gudely large reuenue of his inheritance, that (as the Poet

sayth) at his nede he had nat lest quhair
                  •
                with to buy him a halter to hang hymselfe, he I say that defilit nat onely vthir mens houses with cuckoldrie, but alswa hys awne with incestuous vilanie.
            This man therefoir quhen I say to haif ben belouit of the Quene, and nat onely louit, but also outragiously and vntemperately louit, they that knawe it nat, will paraduenture thinke that I tell monstrous wonders. But some man parhaps will say: was there none vther in all the troupe of the youth of nobilitie, beside him mair worthy to be belouit? Certes there were full many. And ane there was, in all thynges that are wont to allure luif, of all vther maist excellent, euen hir awn husband. Quhat was it than that ioynit sa vnegall luif and sa farre against reasoun? If I shall say it was likenesse of conditions, I shall name a likely cause of luif, though to some men parchance it shal seme ane vntrue cause of thair luif. Neither am I willing to enter into that discourse. Neither do I affrime the rumors spred of hir in France in time of hir frst mariage▪ howbeit the wickitnes of the rest of hir life make some proofe that thay rose nat all of nathing. And many thingis that haif bene noysit of hir 
                  〈…〉
                returne into Scotland, I haue 
                  〈…〉
                to beleue. As for me I am content thay be

buried in forgetfulnes, or if that can nat be, let thaim be discreditit, let thaim be taken for false and fainit. Neither also is it necessarie ouercuriously to examine causis in luif, quhilk is vsually sa caryit with rashe violent motioun of a muddy troublit minde, that for the maist pairt it endeth in madnes, quhilke if ye labour to gouerne by discrete aduise, ye do nathing els but as if ye shold endeuour to be mad with reason. But yit here also there want na causis, for there was in thaim baith a likenesse, if nat of beautie, if nat of outwart thingis, if nat of vertues, yit of maist extreame vices. Sche a young woman, sodenly aduancit to the hiest degree of authoritie, quhē sche had neuer seene with hir eyes, heard with hir eares, nor considerit in hir hart the forme of a kingdome gouernit by law, and thereto was furnishit with the vntemperate counsels of hir kinsmen, quho thaimselfis practisit to set vp a tyrannous rule in France, endeuourit to draw right, equitie, lawes, and customis of auncesters to hir awne onely becke and pleasure.
            Of this immoderate desire there brast out from hir many times many wordes disclosing it. This she studied day and night. But agaynst this desire there withstode the custome of the contrey, the lawes and statutes, and principally

the consent of the nobilitie, quho remainyng safe she cauld neuer attaine it. To the end thairfoir that she might be able violently to atcheue it, she determinit by force to remoue all that stoode in hir way. But she wist not well, by quhat meane, or by quhoes help to attempt it.
            Fraude was the way to worke it, for that vtherwise it was not possible to be obteined. For this purpose thairfoir Bothwell onely semed the fittest man, a man in extreme pouertie, doutfull whether he wer mair vile or mair wickit, & quho betwene factions of sondry religions, despising baith sides, coūterfaitit a loue of tham baith. He quhē he had ones befoir offrit ye Hamiltounis his seruice to murder ye Erle Murray, gaue thairby a likelihode that vpō hoipe of greater gayne he wald not sticke to aduenture some greater enterprise, beyng one quhom the ruine of his awne decayed familie pricked forwart hedlang to mischef, and quhom na respect of godlynesse or honestie restrainit from vngracious doyng. As for excessiue and immoderate vse of lecherie, he therin no lesse sought to be famous than vther mē do shunne dishonour and infamie. Sche thairfoir a woman gredily coueting vntemperit authoritie, quho estemit the lawes hir prison, and the bridle of iustice hir bondage, quhen she saw in hir husband nat

mettall enough to trouble the state, she piked out a man for hir purpose, quho nouther had in his wealth any thyng left to be lost, nor in his fame any thyng remayning that might be stainit, and yet sic a one as stode nat vpon any sic strength but that he might easily be ouerthrowen agayne quhen she should ones waxe wery of him: sic a one as she might easely snare his incontinēce with wanton allurementes, satisfie his nede with money, & binde his assuritnes vnto hir with gilty cōscience cōfederatit in mischefis. These be the foūtaines of that same nat vnmeasurable but mad loue, infamous adulterie, and vile parricide, quhairwith, as with a pledge, that bludy mariage quhas plightit. These thairfoir wer the causes of enterprising that haynous act, to wyte, vnappeasable hatrit of hir husband and vntemperabill luif of hir aduoutrer. There was mairouir a hoipe, that the crime might be diuirtit from thaim to vther, and the executioun for it might be layde vpon vpon the poore liues of thair enemies, and that men maist giltlesse of the fault might be thrust in thair place as sacrifices to appease the pepils displeasure. If nat, quhairto then seruit that battaile almaist begun to be foughten betwene the kyng and Lord Robart hir brother? Quhairto tended those seedis of discorde

scaterit betwene the kyng and the nobilitie? Quhairto reachit that curious entreatie to stay the Erle Murray wyth hir the day befoir the murder was committit? Or quhat cause was there to send for hym? There was an Embassadour come out of Sauoy. For quhat cause? Surely it behouit to be a great cause, and sic as coulde nat be ended without assembly of the nobilitie. No, God wote. The Embassadour of Sauoy, being bidden to late to the christening, came quhen all was ended, nat for ane Embassadour to the christening, but as ane sent to excuse the neglecting of doing that kindenesse, quhen baith he liked not to send sa farre for sa small a mattir, and he was somequhat aschamit to haif faylit in presence, quhen the Frenchmen and Inglishmen had alredy done it. For the maire honorabill dismissing of hym, the Earle Murray was sent for, and that with sondry messingers to cum from his wife that lay dying. Quhat nede was there then of his presence? to draw hym to be a partner in conspiracie of the slaughtir? Quhy was it neuer attemptit befoir? Thought thay it best, then at the last point, at the very instant quhen the murder shoulde be committit, to ioyne him to thair fellowschip, as a light man, incōstant, and shifting his purposis at euery moment

of tyme, infamous in his former life, and nat well assurit in his present staite? Na there is none of these thingis that they yet dare say of hym? Sith then thay can nat imagine a false cause to stay hym, quhat was the trew cause in deid ech man may easily gather: euen the same that causit first the Earle of Athol, & afterwartis hym to depairt from the court: the same that sa oft broght hym in dangir of deith: the same that had sclanderit hym wyth false rumors scaterit in Ingland: the same that presecutit hym with infamous libelles of the murderers thaimselfis: the same that made him to chuse raither to goe into banischment, than to remayne in court amang ruffians weapons with great perill of his life.
            But quhat auayleth thys equitie of the cause befoir hearers eyther vtterly ignorāt of the mater how it was done, or of tham selfis disfauouring this pairt and enuyous, or apt to be caryit away with faynit rumors, quhilk esteme the sclanders of maist lewd slight persons, for sad testimonies, and geue credite to these men, quho boasting at home that thay are able to do what that list, yit neither dare commit thayr cause to the sentence of the Iudges, nor were abill to defend tham selfis in battaill. And as by giltie conscience of offensis thay fearit

iugement: so by raige growen of thayr giltinesse thay runne hedlang to battail, and from battayll runne cowartly away: and now againe quhen standing vpon the aduantage that they haif baith in number and wealth, thay scorne the wisedome of thair aduersareis, and despise thair power in comparison of thair awin: yit distrusting to preuayle by trew manhoode, they fall to robbery, and turne thayr vngracious minde tormentit with inwart terrouris of giltie cōscience, to sclandering, cauillyng, & lesing, quhom yet for the gude wil that I beir to my conterymē, I waid aduise to cease from thys folly, or fury, or disease of euill speiking, lest in time to come, quhen truth shall shine out, thay shut vp and stop with hatrit of tham those persons eares to thayr petitiounis, quhom now they new fill & lode with false rumouris, for thare wyll nat alway be place for forgeuenes: but as darcknes at the sunne shining, so lyes at the light of treuth must vanische away.
            As for the commodious meanes for committing that vile fact, and the hoipe of hiding it, I neid nat to pursue the declaring of tham in many wordis, sith baith the easinesse to do it, the opportuteis of placis, and all aduauncementis of occasiouns and seasons were in their owne power. And to hide the fact quhat

neidit thay, quhē thay fearit na punishment gif it were publishit? For quhat punischment cauld they feir in sa strang a conspiracie? quhen baith the force of lawes, quhairof tham selfis wer gouernours, was vtterly extinguishit, and the mindis of maist pairt of men weir eyther snarit with partenerschip of the mischieuous fact, or caryit wyth hoip, or forestallit wyth rewardis, or discouragit and bridelit wyth feare of sa greit a power on the vther pairt? But how sa euer thys be, yit schall it be gude to see throughly baith the order of the duing, the vnaduisidnes, inconstancie, and end of thayr deuisis. For tharwithall schall ye perceiue that thare wanted nat desire to hyde the fact, but that the furor of a distracted minde ouerthrew all the order of thair coūsels, quhile some time as desyrous to beguyle publike fame, thay endeuourit to keip close thayr intendit mischiefe, yit thay dealt tharein sa opinly, as gif carelesse of thair estimatioun thay seemit to make small accompte howe men iudged of thayr duyngis. For the poysoun at his preparyng to go to Glasco was geuen hym secretly, and thay thoght thay had sufficiently well prouidit that he should in hys absence from tham be consumit with pynyng sicknesse. But the rest of thair dealinges towart hym wer sa cruelly handlit, that

though his disease shold haue happenit to be naturall, yet it wald haue ben suspectit for poysonyng. For he hir husband, the father of hir onely and first borne childe, the father I say of that sonne quhoes Christenyng was solemnisit with sa great pompe and glorie, beyng escapit away in maner nakit as it wer out of his house flamyng in fier, tormentit by the waye with greuous peine, quhē he lay at Glascow of a dangerous sicknesse likely to dye, quhat did hys excellent gude wife the quhile? Quhat dyd sche? At the first newes of it dyd she hast to him in post? Doth sche with her presence, with hir freindly familiar spech, or with hir louyng countenance comfort hym in sicknesse? quhen she can nat stay him in life, commeth she to receiue his last breath? closeth she hys eyes at his deyng? doth she the vther kinde duties of honest matrones? No. But she that had now let him escape to goe and dye, and hopit that he cauld not linger out hys vnhappy life but a few dayes langer, getteth hir a cleane contrary way into an vther contrey in progresse, and with hir faire Adonis she visiteth noble mens houses, and stayneth the houses that harborit them with the spottes of thair vnchastities, and iust about the tyme of hir husbandes death (as she gessit by the strength and workyng

of the poysoun) she returneth to Stereline. Quhen the mater wrought not sa fast as she lukit for & the strength of his youth had wrastlit with the sorenesse of the peine, least she shold seme to haue altogether forsaken hir dutie, sche daily prepareth to go to Glasco, but neuer goeth. At the last disapointit of the hope that sche had conceiuit in hir hart, she taketh hir to vther deuises. She commeth to Edenburgh and there calleth to counsell hir aduoutrer and a few vther priuie of those secrets. There thay decree that in any wise the kyng must be slayne. Yet wer thay nat fully aduisit with quhat kinde of death he should be murderit. Quhilk may easily be gatherit by hir letter quhairin she partly compareth hir selfe with Medea a bludy woman and a poysoning witch. Alswa by an vther of hir letters quharin she asketh aduise about the poysonyng him. The kyng quho had alredy tastit of hir louely cuppe, doutyng whether he wer better any mair to beleue hir flattering speches, or to feare the shrewdnesse of hir nature, though sometime he despeirit not of hir reconciliation, yet euer was somewhat mair feareful and suspicious. But quhen he saw that nouther his life nor his death wer in his power, he was constrainit in silence to purse vp his passit iniuries, to dissemble hys present

feare, and to fayne him selfe some hope for tyme to come. Sa was he led out nat as a husband, but carried out as a corse, or rather drawen as it wer to the shambles. The Quene gloriously shewyng hir selfe in pompous maner goeth befoir in triumph ouer the yong gentleman vexit with all kynde of iniuries, tormentit with poyson, entrappit with treasons and drawen to execution. There followe after the triumphant carre, the auncient enemies to his fathers house, brought thether for the nones, that thay alswa might fede thair eyes with that woefull spectacle, and quhoes death at hād thay lukit for, thay might in the meane tyme take pleasure of the sorow of his hart. And that na ceremonie of solemne sacrifices might be wāting, Ihon Hamilton Archbishop of of S. Androwes was present as thair priest, a man befoir defiled with all kind of wickitnesse, pāpered with the spoyles and murders of hys contreymen, ane auld conquerour of many murderyng victories. The pepill, all alang the way lukyng pitiously shewit a foreboding of na gude lucke to come. The Quenes companiōs, could nouther well enough faine thair sadnesse nor hide thair gladnesse, quhen the haynous outrage of the vile fact intēdit held thair vnmesurable ioy in some suspense vpon expectatiō of

the successe. Thus led they him to Edē
               burgh, nat into the quenis palace. Why so? Least the infection of the pestilent disease forsoth might hurt hir yong sonne: as though thay that be poysonit wer alswa to be shonned for feare of infection. But the truer cause was this, least hys presence should trouble tham, in interruptyng thair free enioyng thair pleasures, and thair consultations about his murder. Quhether then is he led? into the maist desolate part of ye town, sometime inhabitit quhile the popish priestes kingdome lastit, but for certayne yeares past, without any dweller, in sic a house as of it selfe wald haif fallen downe if it had nat bene botched vp for the tyme to serue the turne of this nightis sacrifice. Quhy was this place chiefly chosin? they pretend the holesomnesse of ayre. O good God. Going about to murder hir husband, seeketh sche for a holesome ayre? to quhat vse? not to preserue hys life, but to reserue his body to torment. Hereto tend hir wifely diligent attendance & hir last care of hir husbands life. She feareth least he should by preuenting death be deliuerit from peine, sche wald fayne haue him feele himselfe dye. But let vs see quhat maner of holesomnesse of ayre it is. Is it amang dead mens graues to seeke the preseruing of life? For hard by there were the ruines

of twa Kirkes: on the East side a Monasterie of Dominike Friers: on the West a Kirke of our Ladie, quhilke for the desolatenes of the place is callit the Kirke in the fielde: on the South side the towne wal, and in the same for commodious passage euery way is a posterne dore: on the North side are a few beggers cotages, thē redy to fall, quhilk sometime seruit for stewes for certayne Priestes and Monkes, the name of quhilke place doth plainely disclose the forme and nature thereof, for it is commonly callit Theifis Lane. There is neuer an vther house nere, but the Hameltons house, quhilke is about a stonis cast distant, and that also stoode voyde. Thether remoueth the Archbyschop of S. Andrewes, quho alway befoir was wont to be lodgit in the maist populous pairtes of the towne. He also watchit all that night that the kyng was slayne. Now I beseche you, sith you can nat wyth your eyes, yet at the least wyth your mindes behalde, a house quhilome of auld Priests, amang grauis, betwene the ruines of twa temples, it selfe also ruinous, neere to the theefis haunt, & it selfe a receiter of theefis, nat farre from the fort and garrisoun of hys enemyes that stoode right ouer against the dore, by quhilke if any man should flye out, he could nat escape thair traiterous embushment.

The very shape of this place quhen ye consider in your minde, quhen ye heare of the ruines of Kirkes, grauis of dead men, lurking corners of theefis, brothelhouses of harlotes, doth nat, I say, nat the house onely, but also euery pairt neare about it seeme to proclaime mischiefe and trecherie? Semeth here a king to haue gone into a house for lodging, or to be thrust into a den of thefis? Was not that desolate wastnesse, that vnhauntit place abil of it self to put simple men in feare, to make wiser men suspicious, & to geue naughty mē shrewd occasions? Quhat ment his enemyes vnwontit repayre into those pairtes, and watching all night in maner harde at hys gate? Quhy chose he now thys plaice for his lodging against hys former vsage? The house, ye will say, was empty, and his brothers house, and neare to the kynges lodging. It was empty long befoir, quhy lodgit you neuer there befoir? Quhy forsooke you the populous places in the hart of the citie, and nearenesse to the Court, and thrust your selfe in a desolate corner? quhat profite, quhat commoditie, quhat pleasure herein respectit you? was it your meaning that you beyng ane that euer had bene a gredy coueiter of popular fame, and catcher of courtiers wyth baytes of gude chere, now wald of your

awne accorde goe hide your selfe in a blynde hole out of all companie and resort? that you one raither ouerwhelmit than laden with plentie of benefices, went thether to delite your hart in the ruines of temples? But bee it that your comming thether was but by chaunce, and that you had some causes to goe thether, though nat trew, yet somequhat likely. Quhat meant your vnwontit watching all night? quhat meant the fearefull murmuring of your seruantis that night, quhom yet in that publike tumult you commaundit, nat ones to stirre out of dores? But quhat cause had they to goe out? was it to haif vnderstanding of the matter quhairof your selfe were an autor and deuiser? no, for out of your awne watch tower, you heard with your eares the noyse of the ruine, you saw the smoke and ashes with your eyes, you dranke vp the ioy thereof in your hart, and the sauor of the gunnepouder you in maner snuffed vp at your nose. Perhappes you meant to send out some to receiue thaim that fled. but you saw no man flee. And therefore the lightes that were seene out of the hyest part of your house all the night long, were, as vpon the lucky ending of the thing that you lookit for, euen then sodenly put out.
            But let vs return to the King. Thay

thought it nat enough to haue set opin the posterne in the wall, to let in thiefis thereat, nor to haue set an ambush befoir the dore, that none shauld eschaipe, but alswa thay kept wyth tham selfis the kayis of twa doris, the one of the lower roome quhare thay had vndermynit the wall, and fillit the holes with gunpowder, and the vther of the vpper roome, that the murderaris might come to the King in hys bed. Than of theis few seruauntis that he had, they withdrew the greiter number, beyng sic as wer befoir set about him nat sa mikle to do him seruice, as to be spyes of hys secretes, and cary newis to the Quene. The last that was lefte, one Saunder Duraine, quhen he could finde no reasonable excuse to depairt, was thrust out by the Quene her selfe. Sche in the meane time, meaning not to fayle in playing hyr pairt, quhile Bothwell is in preparing the tragical stage for the murder, dayly visiteth the King: hys heart passionit with loue sometime sche comforteth with sweete promisis, sometime sche vexeth with brawlinges, and styll kepeth his witte occupyit wyth suspitiounis, and rightly representith in action the Poetes fable, quharin is faynit, that Prometheus his liuer daily growing to suffice to new tormentes, is daily gnawin and tyerit vppon by an Egle.

For after the veray saim manner sometime sche cherisheth and refreshith the silly yong gentleman, to none vther end but that he may haif lyfe remayning to suffer moe sorowis.
            Now I beseech you euery one thinke with your selfis vpon the fresh duing of the fact, how mens hartis were mouit, quhen euin now theis thingis can not be heard reportit without indignation. There was prouidit by the maist wickit man in the warld, by hys enemie, by his wiefis aduoutrer, a house in maner seuerit from all haunt of men, fitter for a sclaughter house, than for mans dwelling: it is prouidit for a yong gentilman, vnprouident by youth, easie to be trappit in treasoun by loue, spoylit of hys seruauntes, forsaken of hys frendis: a house (I say) torne, solitarie, on euery syde not onely nat close, but alswa opin to passe through, the kayes therof in his enemeis custodie, no man lefte within but a yong man nat yit recouerit of sicknesse, and an auld man feble by age, and twa strangeris vnacquaintit with the places, matter, and persons, no man dwelling neire but hys enemeis and thiefis. But as for danger of thiefis the gude forecasting woman had well prouidit, for sche had left him na thing to allure a thief withall: and as for hys enemeis, sche had appointed tham to be

but lukers on, and nat pairtplayers in this tragedie: but the glorie of the fact sche reseruit to hyr self and Bothwell.
            Quhat in the meane time doth the Quenes greit carefulnesse? quhat meaneth hir vnwontit resort? quhat hir malicious, and not obsequious diligence? Sche visiteth him daily, sche prolongith hir talke with hym many houris together, twa nightis sche resteth in a lower chamber vnder him, gif giltie conscience of maist haynous duingis can from tormentis of furies suffer that outragious hart to rest at all. Sche fearit perdie, lest if the lower place of the house were left emptie, the noyse of the vnderminers working, and of the bringers in of the powder, should bring some of the seruantes in some suspitioun of treachery. Besyde that sche had a minde to see the thing done her selfe rather then to commit it to the trust of any vther. She had a desire to take a foretast of the ioye to come, and quhen sche could nat wyth hir earis, yit at leist with hir hart to conceiue aforehand the fyre, the smoke, the powder, the cracke of the house falling, the fearefull troubill, the tumulte, the confuse dismayednesse of the doers, the thiefis, and the pepill. All thingis thus preparit for that dolefull night, then entreth sche into the last care of hir gude fame: sche endeuourith to diuert all suspiciounis

from hir, sche goeth to hir husband, sche kisseth him, sche geueth him a ring for pledge of hir loue, sche talketh with him mair louingly then she was wont to do, and promiseth mair largelie, sche faynith that sche hath greit care of his health, and yit her companieng with hir adulter sche surceaseth nat.
            Thay that mair nerely notit these thyngis, prognosticatit na gude thyng to come. For how mekle the greater tokens that the Quene shewit of reconcilit affectioun, so mekle the mair crueltie dyd euery man in his hart fore conceiue of all hir intentions. For els quhense commeth that sodein chaunge? Quhense commeth sa great a care for hym quhom she had poysonit but the moneth befoir, quhom euin lately sche nat onely wishit dead but alswa desirit to see hym dye, quhoes death sche set hir brother, yea baith hir brethren, to procure, and sche like a mayster of mischef thrust forth the kyng to fight, and hir selfe in the meane tyme preparit for his buriall? Not past a few monethes befoir, sche hir selfe was desirous to dye, bycause she lothed to see the king alyue. Quhense commeth now this sodeine care for his health? I luke she shold say she was reconcilit to him. Were you reconcilit to your husband, quhom you sent away into ye desert, that camp of furies as the Poet calleth it? for

quhom among brothellhouses of harlottes, among beggers cotages, among theifes luckyng holes, you preparit a house sa open to passe through that you left therin mair entries then men to shut them? you that allurit and assemblit ruffians to his slaughter, and theifes to his spoyle? you that droue away hys seruantes that shold haue defendit his life? you that thrust hym out nakit, alone, vnarmie, among theifes to be slayne? quhen in all this miserable state of your husband, your adulterer in the meane tyme dwelt in your palace, dayly hauntit your chamber, day & night all doores wer open for hym, quhile your poore husband barred from al companie of the nobilitie, his seruants forbiddē to come at hym or sent away from him, was forsaken and thrust away into solitarie desert for a mockyng stocke, and I wald to God it had ben for a mockyng stocke onely? Of his vther seruantes I enquire nat. I do nat curiously questioun why thay went away, why thay then specially forsoke the kyng, quhen he chefely neded thair helpe and seruice, quhen he was newly recouerit, quhen he began to go abrode and had none vther companie. Of Sawnder Durain I can nat kepe silence, quhom you had for his keper and your spie. Quhat was there for hym to espie? was there any

thyng for him to bryng newes of to an honest matrone, louyng to hir husband, faithfull in wedlocke, and fearefull of a partener of his loue? Fearit she least he a yongman, beautifull, and a king, shold cast wanton eyes vpon some vther woman in her absence? Na God wot. For that was it that she maist desired. For sche hir selfe had practisit to allure him thereto befoir, she hir self had offrit hym the occasions, and of hir selfe shewit him the meanes. This was it that most greuit hir quhile she was sekyng causes of diuorce, that she could nat finde in hym sa mekle as any sclender suspicioun of adulterie. Why then were spies set about hym to watch him? was it not that none of the nobilitie, none of his seruantes, nor any stranger at all should come at hym, that na man should speake with him that might disclose the treason and warne hym of his daunger? This same very Sawnder how carefully sche saueth, quhen she goeth about to kill hir husbande? how late sche sendeth hym away quhen the reste were gone, euen at the very point of hir husbandes death, quhen she had now na mair nede of espialles? For the day befoir the murder committit, there was none of the ministers that were priuie of hir secret counsels left behinde but onely Sawnder. He quhen he saw that night no lesse

dolefull then shamefull to approche, prepareth, as hymselfe thought, a fine suttle excuse to be absent, so as rather chaunce might seme to haue driuen him out, then he him selfe willingly to haue forsaken his maister. He putteth fire in his awne bedstraw, and quhen the flame spred further, he made an outcrie, & threw his beddyng halfe singit out of the kyngis chamber. But the next day quhen that excuse seruit nat sa handsomly as he desirit, for that in the Quenis hearyng, the kyng very swetely entreatit him nat to leaue him alone that night, and alswa desirit him to lye with him selfe, as he had often vsit to do, for the kyng entierly louit hym aboue all the rest, Sawnder in perplexitie wanting quhat to answere, addit to his first excuse feare of sicknesse, and pretendit, that for commodious takyng of phisike for his health he wald lye in the town. Quhen this wald nat yet serue him, the Quene addit hir authoritie and told the kyng that he dyd nat wel to kepe the yongman with him against the order of his health, and therwith sche turnit to Saunder, & bad him goe quhair was best for hym: and forthwith as sone as the word was spokē he went his way. I will nat here precisely trace out all the footynges of the wickit doynges. Nouther will I curiously enquire, whether that former dayes fier wer happenit by casualtie or kindlit by

fraude. Neither will I aske why he that had sa oft ben receiuit to lye in ye kyngis awn bed, doth now this only night specially refuse it. Let vs suppose that sicknes was ye cause therof. This onely ane thing I aske, quhat kinde of sickenes it was, that came vpō him at the very instant, & befoir morning left him agayne without any phisitions helpe, and quhairof neither afoir, nor since, nor at that present, there neuer appearit any token? And I trust, though he hold his peace, ye all sufficiently vnderstand it. In the man gilty in conscience of the mischeuous intentioun, feare of death ouercame regard of dutie. Had it nat bene that Saunder, befoir time a spie & talebearer, now a forsaker and betrayer of his maister, was ioynit to hir in priuitie of all these wickit doinges, wald nat the Quene sa cruell in all the rest, haue founde in hir hart to bestow that ane sacrifice vpon hir husbandis funerallis? Quhile these thyngis were in doing, the night was farre past, & my Lady Rerese a lusty valiant soldiar, befoir signe geuen cummeth forth into the field out of array, abroad sche goeth, getteth hir to Horsebacke, and though sche were somewhat afrayd, as ane that foreknew of the storme to cum, yit sche sate still on horsebacke tarying for the Quene, but yit a gude pretie way from the house. In the meane tyme Paris

cummeth, & then the communicatioun brake, and they rose to depart. For by and by vpon sight of him came to hir remembrance that haynous offence that without great propitiations coulde nat be purgit, forsoth that the Quene had nat dauncit at the wedding feast of Sebastian the minstrell and vile iester, that sche sate by hir husband quho had nat yit fully recouerit his health, that at the banquet of hir domesticall parasite sche had nat played the dauncing skit. A matter surely worthy of excuse. But quhat should she els do? sche must nedes goe as sone as sche saw Paris, for sa it was agreit, and somequhat must neides be pretendit. How happenit it that the vther nightis befoir quhen sche went away earlyer, sche made na excuse at all, and now hir departure about midnight must nedes haif an excuse allegit? But be it sa. Coulde sche remember na better excuse than Sebastians wedding? No no, I say to the contrary that if sche had left the wedding of hir awne naturall brother, or hir sister, to visite hir husband though but a little crased, sche had had a iust excuse befoir all men sa to do. Quhat if sche had done the saime kindnes for the kyng being nat hir husband, or for any vther of the nobilitie? Is Sebastians wedding of sic a value, that a masking daunce thereat is to be

preferrit befoir wiuely dutie and loue? But surely in this curious excusing and pretendit sorrow of neglectit dutie, somequhat lieth hidden, and yit nat sa hidden but that it appeareth through the closure. This ouirmickle precisenes of diligēce, in excusing quhair na nede is, haith some suspicioun of some secrit mischiefe that you are loth to haue disclosit, and the slightnesse of the excuse, encreaseth the suspitioun, specially quhē there were vther matters enow that she might better haue allegit. But let vs admit ye excuse, sith ye quene hir self hath thought it reasonabill. Quhether then goeth sche? streight into hir chamber. Quhat doth sche next? wery it wyth the dayes trauaill and the nights watching goeth sche to bed? no, but sche falleth to talking with Bothwell first almaist alone, and afterwart alone altogether. Quhat talke she had, ye matter it self declareth. For Bothwell after that he had put of his clothes as if he wald haue gone to bed, by and by putteth on vther apparell. Going to do the deid, he wald nat be knawen. I like well the mās policie. But his way was to goe through the watch. Here I maruell at hys madnesse. But mens wittes beset with giltinesse of mischiefis, do commonly bewray thaimselfis by their awne inconstancie, and blinde to all vther

thingis, do see onely that quhilk thay haue bent thair mynde vnto. Quhat he did, the kingis deith, hys awne running away, the confessioun of the gilty personis, & vther thingis that folowit the murder, do declaire. After the great vprore in the towne about it, he as ane vtterly ignorant of all, returneth thorough the saime watch to bed. Quhen noyse of the ruine had fillit all mens eares, and the cracke of it had shaken all the houses, onely the Quene intentiue to expectatioun of the chaunce and broade awake, heareth nathyng at all, and Bothwell heareth nathyng. O marueilous deifnesse! All vther thorough out the towne, as many as were awake were affrayit, and as many as slept wer awakit. At the last Bothwell ryseth agayne, and in one self enterlude sodenly shifting his part from the Poet beōmeth a messenger, he runneth to ye Quene, and thether resort alswa vther that lodgit in the palace. To some the matter seemit true, to some faynir, to some marueilous. Quhat doth the Quene the quhiles? Quhat should sche do? She temperately brooketh hir gude lucke, sche resteth sweetly till the next day at noone. Yit the day folowing, to obserue decorum and comely conuenience in hir pairt without marring the play, sche counterfeiteth a mourning,

quhilke yit neyther hir ioyfulnes dwelling withall in hart suffreth▪ lang to be faynit, nor schaime permitteth to be quholy neglectit. Theis thingis thus lying opin befoir your eyes, thus palpable with handis, thus fast emprentit in mens earis and knowledge, stande we yit in enquiring for the author of the murder, as though it were doubtfull? But ye say, the Quene denyith it? What denyith sche? Forsooth that sche did the murder: as though there were sa greit a difference if ye be the author or the executor, gif ye commaund it or commit it. Sche gaue hir counsell, hir furtherance, hir power and authoritie to the duing of it. Neither is the cause vnknawin quhy sche did it, euin that the saim filthy mariage with Bothwell might be accomplishit. Though all which argumentis and sa many witnessis of thame that wer priuie to it faylit, yit by hir awin testimonie, by hir awin letters it must neidis be confessit. And though all vther thingis wantit, these thingis that folowit the murder do plainly declare the doer, namely, that at ye slaughter of hir husband she sorrowit nat, but quietly restit as after a gay enterprise well atchieuit: that sche mournit nat, but in maner openly ioyed: that sche could abide not onely to luke vpon his dead body, but alswa gredely beheld it:

that sche secretly in the night buryit him without funerall pompe, or rather hid him like a thief: for that fame so inconstant counterfeiting of mourning did plainly bewray it selfe. For quhat ment that remouing to Setons? quhy shonned sche the townis resort and peoples eyes? Was it because sche was aschamit to mourne openly? or because sche could nat wel cloke hir ioy? or secretly to giue hir self all to sorow? No, for at Setons sche threw away all hir disguisit personage of mourning, sche went daily into the fieldes among ruffians, and nat only resortit to hir former custome, but alswa affectit to exercise manly pastimes, and that among men and opinly. So lightly sche despisit the opinioun and speich of her countrey. But I beshrew that same Kiligree, and that saim Monsieur de Croc, that came vpon hir sa vnseasonably, and schewit to vther hyr counterfeited person vnuisorid. For, had not they bene, many thingis that were done might haif bene denyit, many thingis might haif bene handsomely faynit, and mikle the matter might haif bene holpen by forgit rumouris.
            But they will say thare was a solemn enquirie for the murder. Forsooth by Bothwell him selfe principally, and by some vther that than laboured, and yit at this day do labour to deliuer the persons

giltie thereof, from punischement of law, and do now plainly shew quhat they than secreitly meant. But wyth quhat diligence, with quhat vpright seueritie was that enquirie handlit? A few poore saules the nexte dwelling neighbouris to the Kingis lodging being callit, neither durst tell quhat thay had seene and heard, and gif thay touchit any thing neir the matter, eyther they wer with feare put to silence, or dispisit as of na credite: the wiser sort of them durst not offende Bothwell that sate among the Iudges. Ane or twa of the Kingis seruantis that eschapit the mischaunce, wer examinit quhilk way the murderaris came in. Forsoth, sayit thay, we had not the kayes. Quho then had them? It was aunswerit that the Quene had them. So began the secrets of the Court to break out. Then was ye enquirie adiornit, & neuer recontinuit. Quhat can be more seuere and vpright then this enquirie? & yit they preuailit nathing by it. For quhat the examiners wald haif had kept secret, that the pepill cryit out opinly: that quhilk they supressit, bursteth forth: that quhilk they cloke in secreit, breaketh out into broad light. But there was a proclamation set forth, with pardon of the fact and promise of rewart to him that wald vtter it. Why? quho had ben sa mad, that he durst in sa

manifest perill of his life beare witnesse or geue information agaynst the iudges tham selues in quhoes power lay hys lyfe and his death? It was likely forsothe, that they quhilk had murderit a kyng, wald spare him that shold disclose ye murderer, specially quhen all men saw that the enquirie of the kingis slaughter was quite omittit, and the vther enquirie seuerely pursuit concernyng bukes accusing the slaughter. What maner of iugement it was quhairby Bothwell was acquitit, you haue heard. Forsothe by hym selfe procurit, the iudges by him selfe chosen, the accusers by him self subornit, lawfull accusers forbidden to be present vnlesse thay wald yeld thair throtes to thair enemies weapons: the assise apointit nouther to a day accordyng to the law of the land, nor after the maner of the contrey, nor to enquire of the murder of the kyng, but of sic a murder as was allegit to be committit the day befoir that the king was slayne. Here quhen Bothwell by his frendship and power, and the Quene by prayer & threatenings trauailit with the iudges, do you now expect quhat sentence men chosen agaynst law, and agaynst the custome of the land haue pronounced? In thair iugement thay touchit the mater nathyng at all: onely this thay haue declarit, that it was na lawfull iugement,

in this that with ane speciall protestatioun thay prouidit, that it should nat be preiudiciall to tham in tyme to come.
            Then, that all men might vnderstand what it was that thay sought by sword, fire, and poisoun, thay iumble vp mariages: one is diuorcit, an vther is conplit, and that in sic posting spede as thay might scant haue hastit to furnish a triumph of some noble victorie. Yet that in those vnlawfull weddinges, some shew of lawfull order might be obseruit, the gudely banes were openly proclamit. For publishyng wherof though the Minister of the Kirk were thretenit with death if he did it not, yet at the tyme of his publishyng, hym selfe openly protested that he knew cause of exceptioun why that mariage was nat lawful. But in sic a multitude assemblit, how few wer thay that knew it nat? sith all could well remember that Bothwell had then alyue twa wiues alredy not yet diuorcit, and the thyrd nouther lawfully marijt nor orderly diuorcit. But that was nat it that was intendit, to obserue the ceremonies of lawful order, but (as thay vse to do in enterludes) thay prouidit a certain shew or disguisit counterfayting of commoun vsage. For he that hath oft broken all humane lawes, and hath cast away all conscience and religion, could easily neglect the course of Gods law.
            
               Now I suppose I haue brefely declarit (in respect of the greatnesse of the mater) and yet perhaps in mair wordes then nedit (the playnnesse of the proues considerit) of quhat purpose, by quhat counsell, and vpon quhat hope, that hainous murder was attēptit, with what cruelty it was executit, by quhat tokens, aduertisements, testimonies, and letters of the Quene hir selfe the whole mater is prouit, and sa plainly prouit, that it may be as openly seene as if it lay befoir your eyes: yet will I shew fourth the testimonie of the hale pepill, quhilk I thinke worthy nat to be neglectit. For seuerall men do commounly deceiue & ar deceiuit by vther, but na mā deceueth all men, nor is deceiuit by all. This testimonie of the pepill is this. Quhen at the Quenis going abrode amang the pepill, the greatest pairt of the commōs were wont to make acclamations, wishing hir well and happily with sic speches as either luif enforceth or flatterie inuenteth: now at hir going after the kingis slaughter to the castell through ye chiefe and maist populous strete of the towne, there was all the way a sad glū
               ming silence. And quhen ane woman alone of the multitude had cryit God saue the Quene, an vther by and by sa cryit out as all men might heare hir, Sa be it to euery ane as thay haif deseruit.
            
            
               Albeit these thingis were thus done as I haue declairit, yet there are some that stick nat to say that the Quene was nat onely hardly but also cruelly dealt with, that after sa detestabill a fact sche was remouit from regiment: and quhen thay cānat deny the fact, thay complaine of the punishment. I do nat thynke there will be any man sa schamelesse to thinke that sa horribill a fact ought to haue na punishment at all. But if thay complayne of the greuousnesse of the penaltie, I feare least to all gude men we may seeme nat to haue done sa gently & temperately as loosely and negligently, that haue layde sa light a peine vpon an offence▪ sa hainous and sic as was neuer heard of befoir. For quhat can be done cruelly against the author of sa outragious a deid, quhairin all lawes of God and man are violate, despisit, & in maner wholy extinguishit? Euery seuerall offence hath his punishment baith by God and man appointit: and as there be certaine degreis of euill deides, sa are there also encreases in the quantities of punishmentis. If one haue killit a mā, it is a deid of it self very haynous. Quhat if he haue killit his familiar frend? quhat if his father? quhat if in one fowle fact he hath ioynit all these offences together? Surely of sic a ane, neyther ran his life suffice for imposing, nor

hys body for bearing, nor the Iudges policie for inuenting payne enough for him. Quhilke of these faultes is nat cō
               prisit in thys offence? I omit the meane commoun matters, the murdering of a young gentleman, an innocent, hir coū
               triman, hir kinsman, hir familiar, and hir cousin germane. Let vs also excuse the fact if it be possible. She vnaduisitly, a youngwoman, angry, offendit, and ane of great innocencie of lyfe tyll this time, hath slaine a lewde youngman, an adulter, an vnkinde husband & a cruel king. If nat any ane, but all these respectes together, were in this matter, they ought nat to auaile to shift of all punishment, but to rayse some pitie of the case. But quhat say you that none of these thingis can sa mickle as be falsly pretendit? The fact it selfe, of it selfe is odious: in a womā, it is monstrous: in a wife nat onely excessiuely louit, but also maist zelously honorit, it is vncredibill: and beyng cōmittit against hym quhoes age crauit pardon, quhoes harty affectioun requirit loue, quhose nighnesse of kinrit askit reuerence, quhose innocencie might haif deseruit fauour, vpon that youngman I say, in quhom there is nat sa mickle as allegit any iust cause of offence, thus to execute and spend, yea to exceede all tormētis due to all offencis,

in quhat degree of crueltie shall we accompt it? But let these thingis auayle in vther personis to rayse haitrit, to bring punishment, and to make examples to posteritie. But in this case let vs beare mickle wyth hir youth, mickle with hir nobilitie, mickle with the name of a Prince. As for myne awne pait I am nat ane that thinke it alway gude to vse extreme strictnesse of lawe, na nat in priuate, meane, & commoun personis. But in a maist hainous misdeed, to dissolue all force of law, and quhair is na measure of ill doing, there to descend beneath all measure in punishing, were the way to the vndoing of all lawes, & the ouerthrow of all humaine societie. But in this ane horribill act is sic a hochepot of all abhominabill doingis, sic an egernesse of all outragious crueltie, sic a forgetfulnesse of all naturall affectioun, as nathing mair can be faynit or imaginit. I omit all former matters. I will nat curiously enquire vpon princis doingis, I will nat wey thaim by the cōmoun beame. I will nat restraine thaim to commoun degreis of duties. If there be any thing that without great offence may be passit ouer, I will gladly leaue it vnspoken of. If there be any thing that may receiue excuse, either by respect of age, or of womankinde, yea or of vnaduisitnes, I will nat vrge it.

And to passe ouer all the rest, twa haynous offences there be, that neither according to thair greatnes be fully expressit, nor accordsng to thair outrage be sufficiently punishit, I meane the violating of matrimonie, and of Royall maiestie. For matrimonie (as the Apostle sayth) doth truely cōteine a great misterie. For as being obseruit, it compriseth within it all inferior kindes of duties, sa being broken it ouerthroweth thaim all. Quho so hath misusit his fathar, semeth to haue cast out of hys hart all naturall reuerence: but for the husbandis sake, ane shall leaue baith father and mother. Of all vther duties the degreis or like obseruancis, either are nat at all in brute creaturis, or nat sa playne to be discernit: but of matrimoniall loue there is almaist na liuing creature that hath nat some feling. This misterie therefoir quho so nat anely violateth, but also despiseth, he doth nat ouerthrow all the foundations of humayne fellowschip, but as mickle as in him lyeth, dissolueth and confoundeth all order of nature. Quhosoeuer, I do nat say hurteth the king that is the true image of God in earth, but slayeth hym wyth strange and vnwontit sort of crueltie, sa as the vntemperāt and vncredibill outragiousnes is nat contentit with simple torment, semeth he nat, as mickle as in

him lyeth, to haue a desire to pull God out of heauen? Quhat refuge haue thay then left themselfis to mercie that in satisfying their lust of vniust hatrit haif excedit not only all measure of cruelty but also all likelihode that it can be credible?
            But they will say, we ought to beare with and spare hyr nobilitie, dignitie, and aige. Be it sa, gif sche haif sparit him in quhom all theis respectes were greiter, or at leist egall. Let the maiestie of royall name auayle hir. How mikle it ought to auayle to hyr preseruing, hyr selfe hath shewit the example. May we commit our safetie to hyr quho a sister hath butcherly slaughterit hyr brother, a wief her husband, a Quene her King? May we committe our▪ safetie to hyr, quhome neuer shame restraynit from vnchastitie, womankinde from cruelty, nor religion from impietie? Schall we beare with hyr age, sexe, and vnaduisednesse, that without all iust causis of hatreit, despisit 
                  •
               ll theis thingis in hyr kinsman, hir King, hyr husband? Sche that hath sought sic executioun of hyr wrongfull wrath, quhat shall we thinke sche will do being prouoked by reproches to men nat knit to hyr by kindred, subiect to hyr pleasure, not matchit with hyr in egall fellowschip of lyfe, but yeldit to hyr gouernance, and thrall to hyr tormenting crueltie? quhen rage for interrupting

hyr pleasure, and outrage of nature strengthenit with armour of licentious power, shall ragingly triumph vpon the goods and blude of poore subiectis? Quhat is then the fault quhereof we are accusit? quhat crueltie haif we shewit? That a woman raging without measure and modestie, and abusing to all hyr subiectis distructioun the force of hyr power that sche had receyued for theyr safety, we haif kept vnder gouernance of her kinsmen and well willing frendes: and quhom by right we might for hyr haynous deides haif executit, hir we haif touchit with na vther punischment, but onely restraynit hyr from doing mair mischief. For we depriuit hyr nat of libertie, but of vnbridelit licentiousnes of euil duing. Quherin we mair feare among all gude men the blaime of too mikle leuitie, than among euill men the sclander of crueltie.
            These were the causis that mouit the Quene to thys▪ mater. Bothwell also had hys reasons, quhilk nat a litle troublit hys mynde. For quhen that same infamous acquitall rather encreasit than abatit the suspicioun, and the matter coulde nat be alway kept

close, he fleeth to his last refuge, to obteyne of the quene a pardon of all hys offences. But quhen by the lawe of the land in sic charters of pardon, the greatest offence must be expressely mentionit, and the rest it sufficit to include in general wordes: and expressely to confesse, the murder of the kyng semit to stand neyther wyth hys honor nor wyth his safetie: he was driuen of necessitie eyther to inuent or commit some vther crime, eyther maire greuous, or at ye least as haynous, vnder quhilk the sclaughter of ye kyng might lurke in shadow of generall wordes vnexpressit. They could deuise none vther but the same counterfait rauishment of the Quene, quhairby baith the Quene prouidit for enioying hir pleasure and Bothwell for hys safetie.
            
               
               
                  MEmorandum that in the castel of Edenburgh there was left by the Erle Bothwell befoir his fleing away, and was sent for by one George Daglish his seruant, quho was taken by the Erle Moreton, one small gilt cofer nat fully ane foote lang, beyng garnishit in sondry places with the Romaine letter F vnder ane kyngis crowne, quhairin were certaine letters and writynges well knawin, and by othes to be affirmit, to haue béen written with the quene of Scottes awne hand to the Erle Bothwell.
            Beside those writynges there was alswa extant a writyng written in Romane hand in French, to be auowit to be writtē by the sayd quene of Scottes hir self, beyng a promise of mariage to the sayd Bothwell: quhilk writyng beyng without date, and though some wordes therein seme to the contrary, yet is vpon credible groūdes supposed to haue been made and written by hir befoir the death of hir husband, the tenor quhair of thus begynneth.
            
               Nous Marie par la grace de Dieu. &c.
               
                  We Marie by the grace of God. &c.
            
            There is also ane vther writyng in Scottish auowit to be quholly written by the Erle of Huntley, datit the v. of Aprill. 1567. conteyning ane forme of contract for mariage betwixt the sayd quene and Erle Bothwell, subscribit Marie, quhilk is to be auowit to be the proper hād of the sayd quene, and vnderneth it Iames Erle Bothwel, quhilk alswa is to be auowit to be the proper hand of the said Erle Bothwell, at quhilk tyme he was commonly defamit of the kyngis slaughter and nat cleansit or acquitit therof befoir the xij. of Aprill followyng. The tenor of quhilk contract here ensueth.
            
               
                  
                     
                        AT Seyton the v. day of Aprill, the yere of God. 1567. The richt excellent, richt high & mighty Princesse Mary, by the grace of God Quene of Scottis, cōsidering the place & estait quharin almighty God hes constitute hir highnes, And how by the decesse of the king hir husband, hir Maiestie is now destitute of ane husbād, liuyng solitary in the staire of widohede. In the quhilk kinde of life hyr maiestie maist willingly wald

continue, gif the weill of hir realme and subiectis wald permit it. But on the vther pairt considering the incōueniencis may follow, and the necessitie quhilk the realme hes that hir Maiestie be couplit with ane husband, hir highnes hes inclynit to marry. And seyng quhat incommoditie may cum to this realme, incace hir Maiestie should ioyne in mariage with any forein prince of a strange natioun, hir highnes hes thoght rather better to yelde vnto ane of hir awin subiectis. Amangis quhome hir Maiestie findis nane maire able nor indued wyth better qualities than the right noble & hir deare cousing Iames Earle Bothwell. &c. Of quhais thankfull and trew seruice hir highnes in all tymes bypast hes had large pruif and infallible experience. And seing not onely the same gude mynde constātly perseuering in him, but with that ane inward affectioun & harty luif towardes hir Maiestie, hir highnes amangis the rest hes maid hir choyse of hym. And thairfore in the presence of the eternall God faithfully and in the word of ane Prince by these presentis takes the sayd Iames Erle Bothwell as hir lauchfull husband. And promittes and oblissis hir highnes, that how sone the processe of diuorce intentit betuix the sayd Erle Bothwell and Dame Iane Gordon now hys pretensit spouse beis

endit by the order of the lawis, hir Maiestie shal God willing thairefter schortly marry and take the sayd Erle to hir husband, and compleit the band of matrimony wyth hym in face of haly kirk. And shall neuer marry none vther husband but he onely during his life time.Item to the Duke of Norfolke. &c. And as hir Maiestie of hir gracious humanitie and proper motiue without deseruing of the sayd Erle hes thus inclynit hir fauor and affectioun towardes hym, he humbly & reuerently acknawledging ye same according to his bounde dewtie, and being as free and able to make promise of mariage, in respect of the sayd processe of diuorce intentit for diuerse reasonable causes, and that hys sayd pretensit spouse hes thairunto consentit, he presently takes hir Maiestie as his lauchfull spouse in the presence of God. And promittis and oblissis hym as he will answere to God and vpon his fidelitie and honor, that in all diligence possible he shall prosecute & setforwart the sayd processe of diuorce alredy begon and intentit betuix hym and the sayd Dame Iane Gordon hys pretensit spouse vnto the finall end of ane decreit and declarator thairin. And incontinent thairefter at hir Maiesties gude wyll and pleasure, and quhen hir highnes thinkes conuenient shall compleit and solemnizat in face of haly kirk the sayde

band of matrimony with hir Maiestie, and luif, honor, and serue hir highnes, according to the place and honor that it hes pleasit hir Maiestie to accept hym vnto, And neuer to haue any vther for hys wife during hir Maiesties life time. In fayth and witnessing quhairof hir hyghnes & the sayd Erle hes subscribit this present faithfull promise with thair handes as followis, day, yeare & place foirsaidis, befoir these witnes, George Erle of Huntlie, and Maister Thomas Hepburne Parsoun of Auldhāstock. &c.

            Here note that this contract was made the v. of April within viij. wekes after the murder of the kyng quhilke was slayne the x. of the Februarie befoir. Also it was made vij. dayes befoir that Bothwel was acquitit by corrupt iugement of the sayd murder.
            Alswa it appereth by the wordes of the contract it selfe that it was made befoir sentence of diuorce betwene Bothwell and his former wife. And alswa in very truth was made befoir any sute of diuorce intentit or begon betwene hym and his former wyfe, though some wordes in this contract

seme to say vtherwise. Quhilk is thus proned. For this contract is datit the v. of Aprill, and it playnly appereth by the iudiciall actes befoir the twa seuerall ecclesiasticall ordinarie iudges, quhairin is contained the hale processe of the diuorce betwene the sayd Erle and Dame Iane Gourdon hys wyfe that the one of the same processes was intentit and begon the xxvi. day of Aprill, and the vther the xxvij.

                  Qui vient d'aymer de trop▪ d'affection,
                  Son doig monstroit, la tristesse de coeur
                  N'ayant plaisir de vostre grand ardeur
                  En ses habitz monstroit sans fiction
                  Qu'elle n'aucit paour qu'imperfection
                  Peust l'effacer hors de ce loyal coeur.
                  De vostre mort ie ne vis la peaur
                  Que meritoit tel mary & seigneur.
                  Somme de vous elle à eu tout son bien
                  Et n'à prisé ny iamais estimé
                  Vn si grand heur si non puis qu'il n'est sien
                  Et maintenant dit l'auoir tant aymé.
               
               
                  Et maintenant elle commence à voir
                  Qu'elle estoit bien de mauuais iugement
                  De n'estimer l'amour d'vn tel amant
                  Et voudroit bien mon amy deceuoir
                  
                     Par les escriptz tout fardez de sçauoir
                  Qui pourtant n'est on son esprit croissant
                  Ains emprunté de quelque autheur eluissant,
                  A faint tresbien vn enuoy sans l'auoir
                  Et toutes fois ses parolles fardez,
                  Ses pleurs, ses plaincts remplis de fictions,
                  Et ses hautz cris & lamentations,
                  Ont tant gaigné qui par vous sont gardez
                  Ses lettres escriptes ausquelz vous donnez foy
                  Et si l'aymez & croyez plus que moy.
               
               
                  Vous la croyez, las trop ie l'apperçoy
                  Et vous doutez de ma ferme constance,
                  O mon seul bien & mon seul esperance,
                  Et ne vous puis asseurer de ma foy
                  Vous m'est imez legier qui le voy,
                  Et si n'auez en moy nul asseurance
                  Et soupçonnez mon coeur sans apparence
                  Vous deffiant à trop grand tort de moy.
                  Vous ignor ez l'amour que ie vous porte,
                  Vous soupçonnez qu'autre amour me trāsporte,
                  Vous estimez mes parolles du vent,
                  Vous depeignez de cire mon las coeur,
                  Vous me pensez femme sans iugement.
                  Et tout cela augmente mon ardeur.
               
               
                  Mon amour croist & plus en plus croistra
                  Tant que ie viuray, & tiendray à grandheur,
                  Tant seulement d'auoir part en ce coeur
                  Vers qui en fin mon amour paroistra
                  Sy tres à clair que iamais n'en doutra.
                  Pour luy ie veux recercher la grandeur,
                  Et feray tant qu'en vray cognoistra,

                  Duquel alors il n'auoit pas le coeur.
                  Puis me donna vn autre dur alarme,
                  Quand il versa de son sang mainte dragme,

                  Dieu detourne toute malheureux augure.
               
               
                  Ne vous voyant selon qu'auez promis
                  I'ay mis la main au papier pour escrire
                  D'vn different que ie voulu transcrire.
                  Ie ne scay pas quel sera vostre aduis
                  Mais ie scay bien qui mieux aymer scaura,
                  Vous diriez bien que plus y gaignera.
               
               
                  
                     O Goddis haue of me compassioun,
                  And schew quhat certaine profe
                  I may geif, which shall nat seem to him vaine,
                  Of my loue and feruent affectioun.
                  Helas, is he nat alredy in possessioun
                  Of my bodie, of hart, that refusis no payne,
                  Nor dishonour in the life vncertaine,
                  Offence of frendes, nor worse afflictioun,
                  
                     For him I esteme al my frēds les thē nathing,
                  And I will haue gude hope of my enemeis.
                  I haue put in hasard for him both fame & consciēce,
                  I will for his sake renounce ye world,
                  I will die to set him forwart.
                  Quhat remayneth to gief proofe of my constancie?
               
               
                  In his handis and in his full power,
                  I put my sonne, my honour, and my lyif,
                  My contry, my subiects, my soule al subdewit,
                  To him, and has none vther will
                  For my scope, quhilk without deceit,
                  I will folow in spite of all enuie
                  That may ensue: for I haif na vther desire,
                  But to make him perceiue my faythfulnes,
                  For storme or fayre wedder that may come,
                  Neuer will it chainge dwelling, or place.
                  Schortly I sall geif of my trueth sic profe,
                  That he sall know my constancie wtout fiction,
                  Not by my weping, or faynit obedience,
                  As other haue done: but by vther experience.
               
               
                  Sche for hyr honour oweth you obedience:
                  I in obaying you may receiue dishonour,
                  Nat being (to my displesure) your wife as she.
                  And yit in this poynt she shall haue na preheminence.
                  Sche vseth constancy for hyr awin profite:
                  For it is na litle honour to be maistres of your goodes,
                  And I for luifing of you may receiue blame,
                  And will nat be ouercumme by hyr in loyall obseruaunce.
                  Sche has no apprehension of your euyll,
                  I feare so all appearing euill that I can haue na rest.
                  Sche had your acqueintance by consent of hyr freindes,
                  
                     I against al thair will haue borne you affectiō.
                  And nat the lesse (my hart) you doubt of my constance,
                  And of hir faithfulnes you haif firme assurāce.
               
               
                  By you (my hart) and by your aliance
                  Sche hath restored hyr house vnto honour,
                  By you she is become to that greitnes,
                  Of quhilk hyr freindis had neuer assurance,
                  Of you (my wealth) sche got the acquentance,
                  And hath conquest the same time your hart.
                  By you sche hath pleasure and good lucke,
                  And by you hath receiued honour & reuerence,
                  And hath nat lost but the reioysance
                  Of one vnpleasāt foole, quhilk she louit deirly.
                  Than I moane hyr nat to loue ardently
                  Him that hath none in wit, in manhead,
                  In beauty, in bounty, in truth, nor in cōstancy,
                  Ony second: I lief in the beleif.
               
               
                  Quhen you louit hyr sche vsit coldnesse,
                  Gif you suffrith for hir luif passioun,
                  That commith of to greit affectioun of luif,
                  Hyr sadnes schew the tristesse of hyr hart,
                  Taking na pleasure of your vehemēt burning,
                  In hyr clothing she schew vnfaynitly,
                  That sche had na feir, that imperfection
                  Could deface hyr out of that true hart.
                  I did not see in hyr the feir of your death,
                  That was worthy of sic husband and Lord.
                  Schortly sche hath of you all hyr wealth.
                  And hath neuer weyit nor estemit
                  One so greit hap, but sins it was nat hirs,
                  And now she saith that she loueth him so well.
               
               
                  And now sche beginneth to see,
                  That sche was of veray euill iugement,
                  To esteeme the loue of sic ane louer,
                  And wald fayne deceiue my loue,
                  
                     By writinges and paintit learning,
                  Quhilk nat the lesse did not breid in hir braine,
                  But borrowit from sum feate authour,
                  To fayne one sturt and haif none.
                  And for all that hyr payntit wordis,
                  Hyr teares, hyr plaintes full of dissimulation,
                  And hyr hye cryes and lamentations
                  Hath won that poynt, that you keip in store,
                  Hir letters and writinges, to quhilk you geif trust,
                  Ye, and louest and beleuist hyr more than me.
               
               
                  You beleue hir (helas) I perceiue it to well,
                  And callist in doubt my firme constancie
                  (O mine onely wealth, and my onely hope)
                  And I can not assure you of my truth.
                  I see that you esteeme me light,
                  And be no way assurit of me,
                  And doost suspect (my hart) without any appearing cause,
                  Discrediting me wrangously.
                  You do nat knaw the loue I beare to you.
                  You suspect that vther loue transporteth me.
                  You thinke my wordes be but wind:
                  You paint my wery hart, as it were of waxe,
                  You imagine me an womā without iugement.
                  And all that encreaseth my burning.
               
               
                  My loue increaseth and more and more wil increase,
                  So lang as I shall lief, and I shall holde for ane greit felicitie
                  To haue onely pairt in that hart,
                  To the quhilk at length my loue sall appeare,
                  So clearely, that he sall neuer doubt.
                  For him I will striue against wan weard,
                  For him I will recerse greitnes,
                  And sall do so mikle that he shall know
                  That I haif no wealth, hap, nor contentation,
                  
                     But to obay, and serue him truely.
                  For him I attend all gude fortune.
                  For him I will conserue health and life,
                  For him I desire to ensew courage,
                  And he shall euer finde me vnchangeable.
               
               
                  For him also I powred out many tearis,
                  First quhen he made himselfe possessor of thys body.
                  Of the quhilk then he had nat the hart.
                  Efter he did geue me one vther hard charge,
                  Quhen he bled of his blude great quantitie,
                  Through the great sorrow of the quhilk came to me that dolour,
                  That almost caryit away my life, and the feire
                  To lese the onely strength that armit me.
                  For him since I haif despisit honour,
                  The thing onely that bringeth felicitie.
                  For him I haif hazardit greitnes & conscience.
                  For him I haif forsaken all kin and frendes,
                  And set aside all vther respectes,
                  Schortly, I seke the aliance of you onely.
               
               
                  Of you I say onely vpholder of my lyfe,
                  I onely seke to be assuerit,
                  Ye, and dare presume so much of my selfe,
                  To win you in spite of all enuy:
                  For that is the onely desire of your deir loue,
                  To serue and loue you truely,
                  And to esteme all wan hap lesse then nathing,
                  And to follow your wyll wyth myne,
                  You shall knaw wyth obedience,
                  Not forgetting the knawlege of my leal deuty,
                  The quhilke I shall study to the fine that I may euer please you.
                  Louyng nothyng but you, in the subiectioun
                  Of quhome I wyll without any fictioun,
                  Liue and die, and this I consent.
               
               
                  
                     My hart, my bloud, my soule, my care,
                  Helas you had promisit that I should haue that pleasure.
                  To deuise wyth you at leysure.
                  All the night quhair I lye and languishe here,
                  My hart beyng ouerset wyth extreme feare
                  Seing absent the butte of my desire.
                  Feare of forgetting sometyme taketh me,
                  And vther tymes I feare that louesum hart,
                  Be not hardenit agaynst me
                  By sum saying of ane wickit reporter,
                  Uther tymes I feare sum auenture,
                  That by the way should turne abacke my loue
                  By sum troublous and new accident.
                  O God turne abacke all vnhappy augure.
               
               
                  Not seing you as you had promisit,
                  I put my hand to the paper to write,
                  Of ane differens that I haue willit copye.
                  I can not tell what shalbe your iugement,
                  But I knaw well quho can best loue,
                  You may tell who shall winne maist.
               
            
            
               
                  A letter written by hir from Glascow to Bothwel prouing hir hate to hir husband and some suspicicions of practising hys death, quhilk letter was writtē in Frēch, and here ensueth translatit word for word.
                  IL semble qu'auecques vostre absence soit ioynt l'oubly, veu qu'au partir vous me promistes de vos nouuelles. Et toucesfoys ie n'en puis apprendre. &c.
                  
                     IT appearis that with your absence there is alswa ioinit forgetfulnes, seand that at your departing you promisit to make me aduertisemet of your newis from tyme to tyme. The awaytyng vpō tham yesterday, causit me to be almaist in sic ioy as I wilbe at your returning, quhilk ye haue delayit langer then your promise was. As to me howbeit I haue na further newes from you accordyng to my commissioun, I bryng the man with me to Cragmillar vpon monday, quhair he wilbe all wednisday, and I will gang to Edenburgh to draw blude of me, gif in the meane tyme I get na newes in the contrarie fro you. He is mair gay thē euir ye saw him, he puttis me in remembraunce of all thyngis that may make me beleue he luffis me. Summa ye will say that he makis loue to me: Of the quhilk I take sa greit plesure, that I entir neuir quhair he is bot incontinent I take the seiknes of my sore side I am sa troublit with it. Gif Pareis bryngis me that quhilk I send hym for, I trust it sall amend me. I pray you aduertise me of your newes at length and quhat I sall do, in case ye be nat returnit quhen I am come thare, for in case ye worke not wislie I see that the hale burdyng of this will fall vpon my shoulders. Prouide for all thing and discours vpon it first with your selfe. I

send this by Betoun, quha gais to ane day of law of the lard of balfouris. I will say na further, sauffyng that I pray you to send me gude newes of your voyage. From Glascow this saterday in the mornyng.
               
            
            
               
                  An vther letter to Bothwell concerning the hate of hir husband & practise of his murder.
                  EStant party du lieu ou i'auois laissé mö coeur il se peult aysément iuger quelle estoit ma contenance, veu ce qui peult vn corps sans coeur, qui à esté cause que iusques à la disnée ie n'ay pas tenu grand propos, aussi personne ne s'est voulu aduancer iugeant bien qu'il n'y faisoit bon. &c.
                  BEyng departit frō the place quhaire I left my hart, it is easie to be iudgit quhat was my countenaunce, seing that I was euen asmickle as ane body without ane hart, quhilke was the occasioun that quhile dinner time I held purpois to na body, nor yit durst any present thamselfis vnto me, iudging that it was not gude so to do. Fower myle ere I came to the towne, ane Gentleman of the Erle of Lennox came and made his commendations vnto me, and excusit hym that he came not to meete me, by reason he durst not enterprise the same

because of the rude wordes that I had spoken to Cūningham, & he desirit that he should come to the inquisition of the matter that I suspectit hym of. Thys last speaking was of hys owne head without any commissioun. I aunswerit to hym that there wes no recepte could serue against feare, & that he would not be afrayed in case he were not culpabill, and that I aunswerit but rudely to the doubtis that were in his letters. Summa, I made hym holde hys toung, the rest were lang to write. Sir Iames Hammeltoun met me, quho schewd that the vther time quhen he heard of my cō
                     ming, he departit away, and sent Houstoun to schaw hym that he would neuir haue beleuit that he would haue pursuit hym, nor yit accompaneit hym wyth the Hammeltonis. He aunswerit that he was onely cum but to see me, and that he would neyther accompany Stewart nor Hammiltoun but by my commaundement. He desyrit that he would cum & speake wt hym, he refusit it. The Lard of Luse Houstoū & Cauldwellis sonne, wyth xl. horse or thairabout came and met me. The Lard of Luse sayd he was chargit to ane day of law, by the kingis father, quhilk should be this day, against his owne hand writ, quhilk he hes. And yit notwithstandyng, knowyng of my cūmyng it is delayit, he was inquirit to

cum to hym, quhilk he refusit, & swearis that he will indure nothing of him. Neuir ane of ye towne came to speak to me, quhilke causis me thinke that they are hys, and neuerthelesse he speakis gude, at the least hys sonne. I see na vther Gentilman but thay of my cumpany. The kyng sent for Ioachim yesternight and askit at hym quhy I lodgeit not besyde hym, and that he would ryse the soner gif that wer, & quhairfoir I come, gif it was for gude appointment, and gif ye wer thair in particular, and gif I had made my estait, gif I had taken Pareis and Gilbert to wryit to me,This berer wil tel you sumwhat vpon this. and that I would send Ioseph away. I am abashit quho hes schawin hym sa farre, yea he spake euin of the mariage of Bastian. I inquirit hym of his letters, quhairintil he playneit of the crueltie of sum, aunswerit that he was astonyshed, and that he was sa glad to see me that he beleuit to die for gladnes, he fand great fault that I was pensiue, I departit to supper, thys bearer wyll tell you of my arriuyng, he prayit me to returne, the quhilke I did, he declarit vnto me hys sicknes, and that he would make na testament but onely leif all thyng to me, and that I was the cause of hys malady because of the regrait that he had that I was so strange vnto hym. And thus he sayd, ye aske me quhat I meyne by the

crueltie conteynit in my letter, it is of you alone that will not accept my offeris and repentance. I confesse that I haue fayled, but not into that quhilke I euir denyit, and sic lyke hes fayled to sundry of your subiectis quhilk ye haue forgeuen. I am yong. Ye wyll say that ye haue forgeuen me ofttimes, and yet that I returne to my faultis. May not ane man of my aige for lacke of counsale 
                        •
                     all twyse, or thryse, or in lacke of hys promyse, and at last repent hymselfe and be chastised by experience? If I may obteyne pardoun, I protest I shall neuer make fault agayne. And I craue na vther thyng but that we may be at bed and bourd together as husband & wyfe, and if ye wyll not consent heirunto, I shall neuir ryse out of thys bed, I pray you tell me your resolution. God knowes how I am punisht for making my god of you, and for hauing no vther thought but on you, and if at any time I offend you, ye are the cause, because quhen any offendis me, if for my refuge I might playne vnto you, I woulde speake it vnto no vther body, but quhen I heare any thyng, not beyng familiar wyth you, necessitie constreynes me to kepe it in my breast. And that causes me to tyne my wit for very anger. I aunswerit ay vnto hym, but that woulde be ouer long to write at length. I askit

quhy he would passe away in the Inglishe schip, he denyes it and sweares thairunto, but he grantes that he spake wyth the mē. After thys I inquirit him of the inquisitioun of Hiegait, he denyit the same quhile I shewed hym the very wordes was spokin. At quhilke tyme he sayd that Mynto had aduerteist hym that it was sayd that sum of the counsell had brought ane letter to me to be subscriuit to put hym in pressoun, and to slay hym if he made resistence. And he askit the same at Mynto hymselfe, quho aunswerit that he beleuit the same to be true. The morne I will speake to hym vppoun thys point. As to the rest of Willie Hiegaites he confessit it, but it was the morne after my cumming or he did it. He wald very faine that I should lodge in hys lodging, I refusit it, and sayd to hym that he behouit to be purgeit, and that could not be done here, he sayd to me I heare say ye haue brought ane lytter wyth you, but I had rather haue passit wyth you. I trow he beleuit that I would haue sent hym away presoner: I aunswerit that I woulde take hym with me to Cragmillar quhair the medicinar and I myght helpe hym, and not be farre from my sonne, he aunswerit that he was reddie quhen I pleasit, so I would assure him of hys request, he desires no body to see hym, he is angry

when I speake of Walcar, and sayis that he shall plucke the eares out of hys head, and that he lyes. For I inquirit him vpoun that, and that he was angry wyth sum of the Lordis & would threten tham, he denies that & sayis he luifs tham all, & prayes me to geue trust to nathing against him, as to me he wald rather geue hys life or he did any displesure to me. And after thys he shewd me of so many little flatteries, so couldly, & so wyislie, that ye will abash thereat. I had almaist forgot that he sayd he could not doubt of me in this purpois of Hiegaittis, for he would neuer beleue that I quho was his proper flesh would do hym any euill, alsweill it was schawin that I refusit to subscriue the same: but as to any vthers that would pursue him at least he should sell hys life deare enough, but he suspectit no body nor yit would not, but would luif all that I luffit, he would not let me depart fro hym but desirit that I shoulde wake wyth him, I make it seeme that I beleue that all is true, & takes heed thereto, and excusit my selfe for this night that I could not wake, he sayes that he sleepes not well, ye saw him neuer better nor speike mair humblier. And if I had not a pruif of hys hart of waxe, and that mine were not of ane Dyamont, quhairintill no shot can make breach, but that quhilk

comes forth of your hand, I would haue almaist had pitie of hym. But feare not, the place shall holde vnto the death. Remēber in recumpēce therof that ye suffer not yours to be wonne by that false race that wil trauell no lesse with you for the same. I beleue thay haue bene at scholis together, he hes euer the tear in his eye, he salutes euery body, yea vnto ye least, and makes pitious caressing vnto them to make them haue pitie on hym. Thys day hys father bled at the mouth & nose, gesse quhat presaige that is. I haue not yit sene hym, he keepes hys chamber. The kyng desires that I should geue hym meate wyth my owne handes. But geue na mair trust quhair you are thā I shall do here. This is my first iorney, I shall end ye same to morrow. I write all thynges, howbeit thay be of littill weight, to the end that ye may take the best of all to iudge vpon. I am in doing of a werke here that I hait greatly. Haue ye not desire to laugh to see me lie so weill, at the least to dissembill so weill and to tell hym truth betuix handes. He shewd me almaist all that is in the name of the byschop and Suderland, and yit I haue neuer toucheit ane word of that ye shewd me, but allanelie by force flattering, and to pray hym to assure hymselfe of me. And by playning on the byschop I haue drawen it all out of hym.

Ye haue heard the rest. We are coupled wyth twa false races, the deuill sunder vs, and God knitte vs together for euer for the maist faythfull couple that euer he vnitid. This is my fayth I wyll die in it. Excuse if I writ euill, ye may gesse the halfe of it, but I can not mende it because I am not weill at ease, and yit very glad to writ vnto you quhen the rest are sleepand, sithe I can not sleipe as thay do and as I would desire, that is, in your armes my deare loue, quhom I pray God to preserue from all euyll and send you repose, I am gangand to seke myne till the morne quhen I shall end my Bybill, but I am fascheit that it stoppies me to write newis of my self vnto you, because it is so lang. Aduertise me quhat ye haue deliberat to do in the matter ye know vppon thys point, to the end that we may vnderstand vthers weill, that nothing thairthrough be spilt. I am irkit & ganging to sleipe, and yit I cease not to scrible all thys paper insamickle as restis thairof. Waryed might this pokkish mā be ye causes me haue sa mickle paine: for without him I shold haue ane far plesander subiect to discours vpoun. He is not ouermickle diformit, yet he hes receiued verie mickle. He hes almaist slayne me with his breth, it is werse thē your vncles, & yet I cum na nerar vnto him but

in ane chayre at the beds fute, and he beyng at the vther end thairof.

                  Of my estait, of my cumpany, of the occasioun of my cumming, and of Ioseph.
                  Item, the purpois that he and I had together.
                  Of the desire that he hes to please me, and of hys repentance.
                  Of the interpretatioun of his letter.
                  Of Willie Hiegaittis matter of hys departing.
                  Of Monseur de Leuingstoun.
                  I had almost forgot that Monsier de Leuingstoun sayd in the Lady Reres eare at suppar, that he wald drink to the folke that I wist of, if I wald plege thame. And eftir suppar he sayd to me quhen I wes lenand vpoun hym warming me at the fyre: ye haue fayr going to se sik folk, yit ye can not be sa welcum to thame, as ye left sum body this day in regrait, that will neuir be blyth quhill he se you againe. I askit at hym, quha that wes? With that he thrustit my body and sayd, that sum of hys folkes

had seene you in fascherie, ye may gesse at the rest. I wrought thys day quhill it wes twa houris vpoun thys bracelet, for to put the key of it wythin the lock thereof, quhilk is coupled vndirneth with twa cordwinis. I haif had sa littill time that it is euill mayd: but I sall mak ane fairer in the meane tyme. Take heid that nane that is heir se it, for all the warld will knaw it: because for haist it wes maid in thair presence. I am now passād to my faschious purpoes. Ye gar me dissemble sa far that I haif hor
                        •
                     ing thairat: and ye cause me do almost the office of a traitores. Remember how gif it wer not to obey you, I had rather be deid or I dyd it: my hart bleides at it. Summa, he will not come with me except vpoun conditioun that I will promeise to him that I sall be at bed and bourde with hym as of befoyr, and that I sall leaue him na oftar: and doing thys vpoun my worde he will do all thingis that I pleis, and cum with me: bot he hes prayit me to remane vpoun hym quhill vther morne. He spake verie brauely at the beginning, as thys bearar will schaw you, vpoun the purpois of the Inglismen, and of hys departing: bot in the end he returnit agane to hys humilitie. He schewit amangis vther purposes that he knew weill anewch, that my bruther had schewin

me that thing quhilk he had spoken in Striueling: of the quhilk he denyis the ane half, and aboue all, that euir he cum in his chamber. For to make him traist me it behouit me to fayne in sum thingis with him: therfoyr quhen he requestit me to promeise vnto him, that quhē he wes hail we sould haif both ane bed. I sayd to him, fayningly and making me to beleue his promisis, that gif he changit not purposis betuix this and that time, I wald be content therewith, bot in the meane tyme I bad him take heid that he let na body wit thereof: because to speike amangis our selfis the Lordis could nat be offendit, nor wyll euill thairfoyr. But they wald feire in respect of the boasting he mayd of tham, that if euir we aggreit togidder, he should make tham know the litil compt thay tuke of him: and that he counsallit me not to purches sum of tham by him: thay for thys caus wald be in ielosy, gif attanis without thayr knawlege, I sould breke the play set vp in the contrair in thayr presence. He sayd very ioyfully: And thinke you thay will esteme you the mayr of that? bot I am very glad that you speike to me of the Lordis, for I beleue at thys time ye desire that we shold leif togidder in quietnes: for gif it wer vtherwayis greitter inconuenience might come to vs baith

than we are ware of: But now I will do quhat euir ye will do, and will lufe all that ye lufe, and desyres you to make thame lu
                        •
                     e in like maner: for sithe thay seeke nat my lyfe, I lufe thame al equally. Upoun this poynt this berar will schew you many small thinges. Becaus I haif ouer mikle to write, and it is lait, I gief traist vnto him vpon your word. Summa, he will ga vpoun my word to all places. Alas, I neuir deceiuit any body: but I remit me altogidder to your will. Send me aduertisement quhat I sall do, and quhatsoeuer thing sall come thereof I sall obey you. Aduise to with your self if ye can finde out ony mair secrete inuentioun by medicine: for he should take medicine and the bath at Cragmillar. He may not cum forth of the house this lang time. Summa, by all that I can lerne, he is in greit suspicioun: and yit notwithstanding he geiues credeit to my word: bot yit not so farre that he will schew any thing to me. Bot neuirthelesse I sall draw it out of him, gif ye will that I auow all vnto hym. Bot I wil neuir reioyce to diffame ony body that trustis in me: yit notwithstāding ye may commaund me in all thingis. Haue no euill opinioun of me for that caus, by reason ye are the oecasioun of it your selfe, because for my awin parciculer reuenge I

wald not do it to him. He geues me sum checkes of that quhilk I fearit yea euen in the quicke, he sayis thys far, that hys faultis were publeist, bot thare is that committis faultis that beleues thay wil neuir be spoken of, and yit thay will speike of greit and small. As towart the Lady Reres he sayd, I pray God that sche may serue you for your honor. And sayd, it is thought and he beleuis it to be trew, that I haif not the power of my selfe into my selfe, and that because of the refuse I maid of his offeris. Sū
                     ma, for certantie he suspects of the thing ye knaw, and of hys lyif. But as to the last, how sone that I spake two or thre gude wordis vnto hym, he reioysis & is out of dout. I saw him not this euening for to end your bracelet, to the quhilke I cā get no lokkis, it is reddy to tham, and yet I feare that it will bring some malheur, and may be seene if ye chaunce to be hurt. Aduertise me if ye will haue it, and if ye will haue mair siluer, and quhen I shall returne, & how far I may speake. He inragis quhen he hearis of Lethington, or of you, or of my brother. Of your brother he speikis nathyng, he spekis of the Erle of Ergyle. I am in feir quhen I heare him speike: for he assuris him self that he hes not ane euill opinioun of him. He speikes nathing of tham that is out nouther gude nor euil,

but fleis that point. His fader kepis his chamber, I haif not seene him. All the Hammiltonis ar heir, that accompaneis me verie honorably. All the frendis of the vther conueyis me quhen I gang to se him. He desiris me to come, and see him ryse the morne betime. For to make schort, this berar will tell you the rest. And if I learne any thing heir, I wyll make you memoriall at euin. He wyll tell you the occasioun of my remaining. Burne this letter, for it is ouir dangerous, and na thing well sayd in it: for I am thinkand vpoun nathing but fascherie. If you be in Edinburgh at the receit of it, send me word sone. Be not offendit, for I gief not ouir greit credeit. Now seyng to obey you, my deir lufe, I spare nouther honor, conscience, hazarde, nor greitnes quhatsumeuir, take it I pray you in gude pairt: and not eftir the interpretation of your false gude brother:Huntley. to quhome I pray you gyif na credit, aganis the maist faithfull luffar that euir ye had, or euir sall haif. Se nat hir quhaies faynit teares should nat be sa mickle praysit nor esteemit,

                     as the trew and faythfull trauails, quhilke I sustayne for to merite hir place. For obtayning of the quhilke agains my naturall, I betrayis thame that may impesche me. God forgyif me, and God gyif you my onely lufe the hap and prosperitie,

quhilk your humble and faythfull luif desiris vnto you, quha hopis to be shortlie ane vther thyng to you for the rewart of my irksum trauellis. It is lait, I desire neuir to ceisse fra writyng vnto you, yit now after the kissing of your hands I wil end my letter. Excuse my euill writing and read it twise ouer. Excuse that thing that is scribled, for I had no paper yisterday quhē I wrait that of the memoriall. Remember vpon your luif, and write vnto hyr, and that verie oft. Loue me as I sal do you.

                  MOnsieur si l'ennuy de vostre absence, celuy de vostre oubly, la crainte du danger, tant prouué d'vn chacun à vostre tant aymée personne. &c.
                  MY Lord if the displeasure of your absence, of your forgetfulnes, the feir of danger so promisit by euery one

to your so louit person, may gif me consolation, I leif it to you to iudge, seyng the vnhap that my cruell lot & cōtinuall misaduenture, hes hitherto promisit me followyng the misfortunes and feares asweill of lait as of a lang tyme bypast, the quhilke you do knaw. But for all that I will in no wyse accuse you, nouther of your litle remembraunce nouther of your litle cair, and least of all of your promise broken, or of the coldnes of your writyng, since I am ellis so far maid yours, that that quhilk pleasis you is acceptable to me, & my thoghtes are so willyngly subduit vnto yours, that I suppois that all that commeth of you, procedis nat by any of the causis foresayd, but rather for sic as be iust and reasonable and sic as I desire my selfe. Quhilk is the final order that you promisit to take, for the suretie and honorabill seruice of the onely vphold of my lyfe. For quhilk alone I will preserue the same, and without the quhilk I desire nat bot suddain daith. And to testifie vnto you quhow lawlie I submit me vnder your commaundementes, I haue send you in signe of homage by Paris the ornament of the hed quhilk is the chief guide of the vther members.A head.

You had promisit me that you would resolue all, and that you would send me word euery day quhat I should doe, you haue done nothing thairof. I aduertisit you well to take heede of your false brother in law: he came to me, and without shewing me any thing frō you, told me that you had willit him to write to you that that I should say, & quhaire and quhan you should cum to me, and that that you should do touchand hym, and thereuppon hath preachit vnto me that it was a foolishe enterprise, & that with mine honour I could neuer marry you, seing that being maryed you did carry me away, & that his folkes would not suffer it, and that the Lordis would vnsay themselfis, and would deny that thay had sayd. To be short, he is all contrary. I tolde hym, that seing I was cum so farre, if you did not withdraw your selfe of your selfe, that no perswasioun nor deith it selfe should make me fayle of my promise. As touching the place you are to negligent (pardon me) to remit your selfe thereof vnto me. Chuse it your selfe, and send me worde of it.

you haue not thought therupō in time. And if you had not mair chaungit your mynde since myne absence than I haue, you should not be now to aske such resoluing. Well there wanteth nothing of my part, and seing that your necligence doth put vs baith in the daunger of a false brother, if it succeede not well, I wyll neuer rise agayne. I send this bearer vnto you for I dare not trust your brother with these letters nor with the diligence. He shall tell you in quhat stait I am, and iudge you quhat amendment these new ceremonies haue broght vnto me. I would I wer deid, for I see all goeth ill. You promisit vther manner of matter of your forseyng, but absence hath power ouer you, quho haue twa stringis to your bow.An other wife. Dispatch the aunswere, that I fayle not, and put no trust in your brother for this enterprise, for he hath tolde it, and is also all against it. God geue you gude nicht.

            IMmediatly after the death of the kyng quho was murtherit and hys house blowen vp with gonnepoulder the ix. day of February in the night. 1567. Proclamatioun was made that quhosoeuer could bewray the murtherers of the king should haue two thousand pound. Unto the quhilk proclamatioun, reply was made and set vp priuely vpoun the tolbuith doore of Edenburgh the 16. of February in this maner.
            Bycause proclamatioun is made that quhosoeuer will reueale the murther

of the kyng shall haue two thousand pound, I quho haue made inquisitioun by them that were the doers therof, affirme that the committers of it were the Erle Bothwell,If this be not true spere at Gilbert Bawfoord M. Iames Balfoure, the Persoun of Flisk, M. Dauy Chambers, Blacke M. Iohn Spence quho quhas principall deuiser of the murther, and the quene assentyng thairto through the persuasioun of the Erle Bothwell, and the witchcraft of the Lady Bucklowgh.
            Upon this, new proclamation was made the same day, desiryng the setter vp of the sayd Bill to come and auowe and subscribe the same, and he should haue the summe promisit in the first proclamatioun, and further accordyng to his abilitie, and sight of the quene, and hir counsell.

            FOrasmekle as proclamatioun hath bene made since the settyng vp of my first letter, desiryng me to subscribe, and auow the same, For aunswer, I desire the mony to be consignit

into an éeuenly mans hand, and I shall compéere on Sonday nexte with iiij. some with me, and subscribe my first letter, and abide therat. And further I desire that Senior Frauncis, Bastian, and Ioseph the quenes goldsmith be stayit, and I shall declaire quhat euery man did in particuler, with their complices.
            To quhilk bill none aunswer was made.
            The xiiij. day of Aprill the Erle Bothwell commyng to the Sessions at Edenburgh with antesigne displaide & the stréetes full of armed men of hys factioun, was arreynit for the murther of the kyng, and acquit of the same by a pariurde iury: quhairupon he set vp a challenge to fight hand to hand with any man (beyng no person diffamed) that wald auow the matter. Hereunto aunswere was made by an vther Bill set vy in the same place anone after. That for asmickle as the sayd Erle Bothwell had set vp a writyng subscribed with his awne hand, quhairby he dyd chalenge any man (nat diffamed) that would or durst say

he was giltie of the kyings death, and therwithal did giue the ly in his throte to him that wald auouch the quarell: a gentleman & a man of gude fame did by those presentes accept the offer and offers, and wald proue by the law of armes that he was the chefe author of that foule and horrible murther, albeit an inquest for feare of death had slyghtly quyte hym. And bycause the kyng of Fraunce and the quene of England had by thair Ambassadours desired that tryall and punishement might be had for the same, he maist hartily thairfoir craued of thair Maiesties, that thay wald desire of the quene hys souereine, that by hir consent thay might appoynt the day and place within their dominions for the triall therof accordyng to the law of armes, in thair presences or in thair deputies. Quhilk day & place he promised by the faith of a gentlemā to appeare at, and to do his deuoyre, prouided alwayes that thair Maiesties by open proclamatioun shall giue assurance too hym and to hys companie, too passe and repasse through thair countryes, without hurt or impediment.

Quhat iust cause he had too desire the kyng of Fraunce and the quene of England too be iudges in the case, he remitted too the iugement of the readers and the hearers, warnyng by those presentes the rest of the murtherers to prepare them selues, for thay should haue the lyke offer made vnto them, and thair names giuen in wrytyng that thay might be knawin too all men.
