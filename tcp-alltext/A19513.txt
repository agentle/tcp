                           Psal. 137. 5. 6. 
                           forget thee O Ierusalem, let my right hand forget (to

play;) if I doe not remember thee, let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth: if I preferre not Ierusalem to my chiefe ioy: We are heere in a strange land, shall we forget Our Sion and Ierusalem which is aboue. Alas, that wee are bewitched with the pleasures of Babel, and do not long as we should to see our Fathers house, that wee may be for euer with the Lord.
                     
                     
                        
                        I goe to prepare a place for you.
                        THe second degree of2 The secōd degree of the comfort, is a consideration of the right wee haue to these heauenly mansions. the comfort is in these words: the disciples and others his Saints might haue said, Lord, it is ioyfull for vs to heare of thy Fathers house, and of the many Mansions which are in it; but what is that vnto vs? what right or interest haue we in it? To this doubt, the Lord opposeth this second degree of comfort; wherein that which hee spake generally in the

first, hee applies particularly to them: the Mansions of my Fathers house are for you and such as you are: I shall make you a right vnto them; for this cause came I into the world; for this cause goe I vnto my Father, that I may prepare a place for you.
                        This comfort is mostWithout this, the first degree of comfort could not availe vs. And why? necessary: for what auails it vnto vs to heare of the ioyes of that life to come, and of the glory of that kingdome, vnlesse wee know, that it belongs vnto vs? The wicked heareth tell of it, but shall

euer see it, yea, they may st of the powers of the life come, but shal neuer en

WeIn the Mystical body all the life is in the head, and hee will not faile to draw all his members after him. speake it of the naturall body, where the head goes through, it will draw the whole body after it: this is much more true in the mysticall body; for whereas in the naturall

body there are moe vitall parts then one, in the mysticall there is no vitall part but the head: so long as there is life in the head, and that shal be for euer; for Christ is now risen from the dead, and can dye no more, the members shall not want life. Such as are in him feeles vertue flowing frō him, to draw them vp to himselfe, to renew and prepare them for these new Heauens, wherein dwelleth righteousnesse, and into the which no vncleane thing can enter. Aboue all things let vs take heede that wee finde

this attractiue vertue in our selues: for thereby shall wee know that our Lord is preparing a place for vs in these heauenly Mansions.

Apostle vseth not the word

                           eauen more clearly manifested; and to say, that the way and dore of heauen was closed & locked

vp before, til Christ came and opened it: and therfore the Iesuites themselues are forced to translate this word as I haue alledged; The way of the holiest was not yet manifested. They had the same Couenant of Grace that wee haue, but they had it infolded & couered with figures and shadowes, we haue it outfolded and clearely proponed without figure or shadow. The Sunne before his rising sends out a light, whereby any man that hath eyes may see the way wherein he should walke,

but when it riseth, it brings with it a greater light, whereby the way is more clearly manifested. The Lord Iesus before his in carnation sent out a light, which shewed the way of saluation to so many as were appointed for it, and by that light they walked vnto it; but much more clearely hath hee manifested it by his owne comming. These words are abused, when another sense is inforced vpon them.

the word, strengthens Faith, and remoueth all causes of dubitation furnished by infidelitie. But that I may eschew repetition, he that lists may read this matter entreated at greater length on the eight to the Romanes, where we haue also proued that Saints called once by grace, and iustified by Faith, are sure of finall perseuerance.

Both night and day hee cryed in the mountaines and in the graues, and strucke himselfe with stones. But here is the great inconsideration of men: A man this way bodily possessed, is pityed of all that behold him: but though hee be spiritually possessed, and oppressed by the enemies

of his soule, to raging, railing, blaspheming, whoring, and all sort of impietie, who doth regard it? Alwayes, to returne great is the praise of Patience, that it makes a man possesser and master of himselfe.
                        The reason of this is,Patience is neuer alone without the rest of the Graces. because Patience is neuer alone, all the remanent Graces of the Spirit frequent the Palace of Patience, there are they preserued, and entertayned. As vices are linked together, so are Vertues: they march in battle against the spirituall

him, which without failing comes alway in the time of neede. And this is the way whereby the Saints of GOD possesse their Soules in Patience.
                        Of this it is euident,No true Patience can bee, where Truth, Loue, and Faith, &c. are not. that no true Patience can bee, where Truth, Faith, Loue, and the rest of these Graces are not: and therefore the greatest sufferings of Ethnikes, Heretiques, and others voyd of Faith, Truth, and Loue, are iustly excluded from the praise of Patience: Ethnici multa tulerunt animo forti, nulla

tamen cum solida consolatione: Ethnikes haue suffered many things with a strong, or rather an obstinate heart, but without any solide consolation. Curtius a Romane

                        And of this same natureSufferings of Heretikes in like manner are not to be esteemed Patience. is the Patience of Heretiques: they may make a shew of voluntary Religion in not sparing the body, but seeing they haue not the truth of GOD, how can they haue true Patience? The Baalites of Idolatrous Israell launcing themselues with kniues: the Gymnosophists of India, who pine and distresse their bodyes with labour not required at their hands: the Poenitentiaries of Rome (so much boasted

of) who scourge themselues, and spare not their owne flesh: the foure religious Orders of superstitious men among the Turkes, who in hard vsing of their bodies goe beyond these I haue spoken of: yet are they all strangers from this Praise of Patience. Cum ergo vider is

thing patiently, prayse not thou incontinent his Patience, for patient suffering cannot bee commended, vnlesse the cause of the suffring be known: if the cause bee good, then the Patience is good also.

in his learned Disputes,Aug. de temp. serm. 223. pulleth from them the Praise of Patience: Quid miseri faciunt, qui cum non solum impietatis aduersus Deum, sed etiam ipsius, quam in se exercuerunt crudelitatis, luant poenas, insuper & quaerunt Martyrum glorias? What doe these miserable men, who when they suffer punishment of their impietie toward GOD, and crueltie toward themselues, yet out of such suffering seeke the glory of Martyrdome? An impatiens passio coronabitur? Shall an impatient

passion bee crowned? Aut quomodo innocens iudicabitur cui dictum est, diliges proximum sicut teipsum, si homicidium committit in seipso, quod committere prohibetur in altero? Or how shall hee be iudged innocent, who is commanded to loue his neighbour as himselfe, if hee commit murther in himselfe, which hee is forbidden to commit in another? Si enim parricida
                           The worst sort of homicide is selfe-murther.

Here is a Preseruatiue able to keepe peace in thy heart, and to banish all perturbation. And it serues for all tentations, for all places, for all persons. Are thy tentations immediately
