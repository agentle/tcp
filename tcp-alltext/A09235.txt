               Iohn Felton his freend is hangd in a rope:
               And farther, a right his grace to enforme,
               He dyed a Papiſt, and ſeemd not to turne.
            
            To the tune of Row well ye Mariners.
            
               WHo keepes Saint Angell gates?
               Where lieth our holy father ſay?
               I muze that no man waytes,
               Nor comes to meete me on the way.
               Sir Pope I ſay? yf you be nere,
               Bow downe to me your liſtning eare:
               Come forth, beſturre you then a pace,
               Fo I haue newes to ſhow your grace.
               Stay not, come on,
               That I from hence were ſhortly gon:
               Harke well, heare mee,
               What tidings I haue brought to thee
            
            
               
                  ❧The Bull ſo lately ſent
               To England by your holy grace,
               Iohn Felton may repent
               For ſettyng vp the ſame in place:
               For he vpon a goodly zeale
               He bare vnto your common weale
               Hath ventured lyfe to pleaſure you,
               And now is hangd, I tell you true.
               Wherfore, ſir Pope,
               In England haue you loſt your hope.
               Curſe on, ſpare not,
               Your knights are lyke to go to pot.
            
            
               ¶But further to declare,
               He dyed your obedient chylde:
               And neuer ſeemd to ſpare,
               For to exalt your doctrine wylde:
               And tolde the people euery one
               He dyed your obedient ſonne
               And as he might, he did ſet forth,
               Your dignitie thats nothyng worth.
               Your traſh, your toyes,
               He toke to be his onely ioyes:
               Therfore, hath wonne,
               Of you the crowne of martirdome.
            
            
               ¶Let him be ſhryned then
               Accordyng to his merits due,
               As you haue others doen
               That proue vnto their Prince vntrue:
               For theſe (ſir Pope) you loue of lyfe,
               That wt their Princes fall at ſtryfe:
               Defendyng of your ſupreame powre,
               Yet ſom haue paid ful deare therfore.
               As now, lately,
               Your freend Iohn Felton ſeemd to try
               Therfore, I pray,
               That you a maſſe for him wyll ſay.
            
            
               ¶Kyng all the belles in Rome
               To doe his ſinful ſoule ſome good,
               Let that be doen right ſoone
               Becauſe that he hath ſhed his blood,
               His quarters ſtand not all together
               But ye mai hap to ring them thether
               In place where you wold haue them be
               Then might you doe as pleaſeth ye.
               For whye? they hang,
               Vnſhryned each one vpon a ſtang:
               Thus ſtandes, the caſe,
               On London gates they haue a place.
            
            
               ¶His head vpon a pole
               Stands wauerīg in ye wherlīg wynd,
               But where ſhoulde be his ſoule
               To you belongeth for to fynd:
               I wyſh you Purgatorie looke
               And ſearch each corner wt your hooke,
               Leſt it might chance or you be ware
               The Deuyls to catce him in a ſnare.
               Yf ye, him ſee,
               From Purgatorie ſet him free:
               Let not, trudge than,
               Fetch Felton out and yf ye can.
            
            
               ¶I wyſh you now ſir Pope
               To loke vnto your faithful freendes,
               That in your Bulles haue hope
               To haue your pardon for their ſinnes,
               For here I tell you, euery Lad
               Doth ſcoff & ſcorne your bulles to bad,
               And thinke they ſhall the better fare
               For hatyng of your curſed ware.
               Now doe, I end,
               I came to ſhow you as a frend:
               Whether bleſſe, or curſe,
               You ſend to me, I am not the worſe.
            
            
               Steuen Peele.
            
            ¶FINIS.
