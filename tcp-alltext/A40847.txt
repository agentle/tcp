            To the Tune of, Five Sail of Frigats bound for Malago, &c.
            
            
               
            
            
               COme all you brave Sailors
               that ſails on the Main,
               I'll tell you of a Fight
               that was lately in Spain,
               
               And of five Sail of Frigats
               bound to Malago,
               
               For to fight the Proud Spaniards,
               
               our Orders was ſo:
            
            
               There was the Henry and Ruby,
               
               and the Antelop alſo,
               The Grey-hound, and the Bryan,
               
               for Fire-ſhips muſt go,
               But ſo bravely we weighed,
               and played our parts,
               That we made the Proud Spaniards,
               
               to quake in their hearts
            
            
               Then we came to an anchor
               ſo nigh to the Mould,
               Methinks you Proud Engliſh
               
               do grow very bold:
               But we came to an anchor
               ſo near to the Town,
               That ſome of their Churches
               we ſoon battered down.
            
            
               They hung out their Flag of Truce,
               for to know our Intent,
               And they ſent out their Long-boat,
               to know what we meant:
               But our Captain he anſwered
               them bravely, it was ſo,
               For to burn all your Shipping,
               before we do go.
            
            
               For to burn all our Shipping,
               you muſt us excuſe,
               'Tis not five Sail of Frigats
               ſhall make us to muſe.
               But we burnt all their Shipping,
               and their Gallies alſo,
               And we left in the City
               full many a Widow.
            
            
               Come then, ſays our Captain,
               leſs fire at the Church;
               And down came their Belfrey,
               which grieved them much;
               And down came the Steeple,
               which ſtandeth ſo high;
               Which made the Proud Spaniards
               
               to the Nunnery flye.
            
            
               So great a Confuſion
               we made in the Town,
               That their lofty Buildings
               came tumbling down:
               Their Wives and their Children
               for help they did cry,
               But none could relieve them,
               though danger was nigh.
            
            
               The flames and the ſmoak,
               ſo increaſed their woe,
               That they knew not whither
               to run nor to go;
               Some to ſhun the Fire,
               leapt into the Flood,
               And there they did periſh
               in Water and Mud.
            
            
               Our Guns we kept firing,
               ſtill ſhooting amain,
               Whilſt many a Proud Spaniard
               
               was on the place ſlain:
               The reſt being amazed,
               for ſuccour did cry,
               But all was in vain,
               they had no where to flye.
            
            
               At length being forced,
               they thought it moſt fit,
               Vnto the brave Engliſh Men
               for to ſubmit:
               And ſo a concluſion
               at laſt we did make.
               Vpon ſuch Conditions
               as was fit to take.
            
            
               The Spaniſh Armado,
               did England no harm,
               'Twas but a Bravado
               to give us alarm;
               But with our five Frigats
               we did them bumbaſt,
               And made them of Engliſh Mens
               Valour to taſte.
            
            
               When this noble Victory
               we did obtain,
               Then home we returned
               to England again;
               Where we were received,
               with Welcomes of Ioy,
               Becauſe with five Frigats
               we did them deſtroy.
