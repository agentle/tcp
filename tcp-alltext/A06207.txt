                  The hand of Heauen is on me, be it farre

                  Haue pul'd this curſe vpon me, lend me teares.
                  Enough to waſh me white, that I may feele
                  A childlike innocence within my breſt;
                  Which once perform'd, O giue me leaue to ſtand

                  To take by treaſon hence this loathed life,
                  That would but be to ſerue her, I haue pardon'd
                  And pardon'd, and by that haue made her fit
                  To practiſe new ſinnes, not repent the olde;
                  Shee now has hir'd a ſlaue to come from thence

                  Tooke, and condemn'd, and executed there
                  The carefulſt ſeruant: Heauen let me but liue
                  To pay that man; Nature is poore to me,
                  That will not let me haue as many deathes
                  As are the times that he hath ſau'd my life,

                  Made me forget my naturall offices;

                  Nay, let me ſtay alone,

                  VVill build me ſomething to diſtinguiſh me
                  From other women: Many a weeping verſe

                      hight,

                  Tigr.
                  Alas, that thou wilt aske me; Aske the man
                  That rages in a feauer, why hee lies
                  Diſtemper'd there, when all the other youths
                  Are courſing ore the Meadowes with their loues?
                  Can I reſiſt it? am I not a ſlaue
                  To him that conquer'd me?

                  That conquer'd thee, Tigranes he has won but halfe of
                  Thy bodie; but thy minde may be as free
                  As his, his will did neuer combate thine,
                  
                     
And take it priſoner:
               
               
                  Tigr.
                  But if hee by force
                  Conuey my bodie hence, what helpes it me
                  Or thee to be vnwilling?
               
               
                  Spa.
                  O Tigranes,
                  
                  I know you are to ſee a Ladie there,
                  To ſee, and like I feare: perhaps the hope
                  Of her makes you forget me ere we part,
                  Be happier then you know to wiſh: farewell.

                  In ſhort deſtruction meete me, that I may
                  See it, and not auoid it when I leaue
                  To be thy faithfull Louer: part with me
                  Thou ſhalt not, there are none that know our loue;
                  And I haue giuen gold to a Captaine
                  That goes vnto Iberia from the King,
                  That he would place a Ladie of our Land
                  With the Kings ſiſter that is offer'd me;
                  Thither ſhall you, and being once got in,
                  Perſwade her by what ſubtile meanes you can
                  To be as backward in her loue as I.
               
               
                  Spa.
                  Can you imagine that a longing maide
                  VVhen ſhee beholds you, can be puld away
                  VVith words from louing you?

                  Diſpraiſe my health,

                  VVhy, I had rather looſe you: Can my heart
                  Conſent to let my tongue throw out ſuch words,
                  And I that euer yet ſpoke what I thought,
                  Shall find it ſuch a thing at firſt to lie:

                  So doe I my Lord.
                  I ſorrow for her that ſo little grace
                  Doth gouerne her, that ſhee ſhould ſtretch her arme
                  Againſt her King, ſo little womanhood
                  And naturall goodneſſe, as to thinke the death
                  Of her owne Sonne.

                  Thou know'ſt the reaſon why,

                  There is a Ladie takes not after you,

                  Whoſe teares paid downe his ſinnes, marke how ſhee weeps,

                  To ſorrow, yet by gracefulneſſe in her
                  Find out the way, and by your reaſon weepe:
                  All this ſhee does for you, and more ſhee needes,
                  When for your ſelfe you will not loſe a teare,
                  
                     
Thinke how this want of griefe diſcredits you,
                  And you will weepe, becauſe you cannot weepe:

                  No Virgin beares about her; ſhould I excuſe

                  In looſing which, a brother and a King
                  Were taken from me; If I ſeeke to ſaue
                  That life ſo lou'd, I looſe another life
                  That gaue me being, I ſhall looſe a Mother,
                  A word of ſuch a ſound in a childes eare,
                  That it ſtrikes reuerence through it: May the will
                  Of Heauen be done, and if one needes muſt fall,
                  Take a poore Virgins life to anſwere all.

                  But Gobrias let vs talke; you know this fault
                  Is not in me as in another woman▪

                  Nay, ſhould I ioine with you,

                  Gob.
                  And to mee
                  He writes, what teares of ioy he ſhed to heare
                  How you were growne in euery vertuous way,
                  And yeilds all thankes to me, for that deare care
                  Which I was bound to haue in training you:
                  There is no Princes liuing that enioyes
                  A Brother of that worth.
               
               
                  Pan.
                  My Lord, no Maide longs more for any thing, or feeles more heate and cold within her breſt, then I doe now, In hope to ſee him.
               
               
                  Gob.
                  Yet I wonder much at this, hee writes he brings along with him a husband for you, that ſame Captiue Prince;
                  And if he loue you as he makes a ſhew,
                  He will allow you freedome in your choiſe.
               
               
                  Pan.
                  And ſo he will my Lord, I warrant you
                  He will but offer, and giue me the power
                  To take▪ or leaue.
               
               
                  Gob.
                  Truſt me, were I a Ladie I could not like
                  That man were bargain'd with before I chuſe him.
               
               
                  Pan
                  But I am not built on ſuch wild humors,
                  If I find time worthy, he is not leſſe,
                  Becauſe hee▪s offerd.
               
               
                  Spa.
                  Tis true, he is not, would he would ſeem leſſe:
               
               
                  Gob.
                  I thinke there is no Ladie can affect
                  Another Prince, your Brother ſtanding by;
                  He does eclipſe mens vertues ſo with this.
               
               
                  Spa.
                  I know a Lady may, and more I feare
                  Another Lady will.

                  Would I might ſee him:
               
               
                  
                  Gob.
                  Why ſo you ſhall: my buſineſſes are great,
                  I will attend you when it is his pleaſure
                  To ſee you Madam.
               
               
                  Pan.
                  I thanke you good my Lord.
               
               
                  Gob.
                  You will be ready Madam:
                  Exit.

                  Yes.

                  I doe beſeech you Madam ſend away
                  Your other women, and receiue from me
                  A few ſad words, which ſet againſt your ioyes,
                  May make vm ſhine the more.

                  Sirs leaue me all.

                  I kneele a ſtranger here to beg a thing
                  Vnfit for me to aske, and you to grant,
                  Tis ſuch another ſtrange ill laid requeſt,
                  As if a beggar ſhould intreat a King
                  To leaue his Scepter and his Throne to him,
                  And take his rags to wander ore the World
                  Hungry and cold.

                  That were a ſtrange requeſt.

                  Alas, tis of that nature, that it muſt
                  Be vtterd, I, and granted, or I die:
                  I am aſham'd to ſpeake it; but where life
                  Lies at the ſtake, I cannot thinke her woman,
                  That will not take ſomething vnreaſonably
                  To hazard ſauing of it: I ſhall ſeeme
                  A ſtrange petitioner, that wiſh all ill

                  Nor wiſe, for in your ill conſiſts my good:
                  If you were fooliſh, you would heare my prayer;
                  If foule, you had not power to hinder me:
                  He would not loue you.
               
               
                  Pan.
                  VVhats the meaning of it?

                  Nay, my requeſt is more without the bounds
                  Of reaſon yet; for tis not in the power
                  Of you to doe what I would haue you grant.

                  VVhy then tis idle, prethee ſpeake it out.

                  Your brother brings a Prince into this Land
                  Of ſuch a noble ſhape, ſo ſweete a grace,
                  So full of worth withall, that euery maide
                  That lookes vpon him, giues away her ſelfe
                  To him for euer; and for you to haue
                  He brings him: and ſo mad is my demand,
                  That I deſire you not to haue this man,
                  This excellent man, for whom you needs muſt die,
                  If you ſhould miſſe him. I doe now expect
                  You ſhould laugh at me.

                  Truſt me, I could weepe

                  Tis by me,

                  His owne deſire, why credit me Thaleſtris
                  
                  I am no common wooer: If he ſhall wooe me,
                  His worth may be ſuch, that I dare not ſweare
                  I will not loue him; but if he will ſtay
                  To haue me wooe him, I will promiſe thee
                  He may keepe all his graces to himſelfe,
                  And feare no rauiſhing from me.

                  Tis yet
                  His owne deſire, but when he ſees your face,
                  I feare it will not be; therefore I charge you
                  As you haue pitty, ſtop thoſe tender eares
                  From his inchanting voice, cloſe vp thoſe eyes,
                  That you may neither catch a dart from him,
                  Nor he from you: I charge you as you hope
                  To liue in quiet, for when I am dead
                  For certaine I ſhall walke to viſit him,
                  If he breake promiſe with me: for as faſt
                  As oathes without a formall ceremony
                  Can make me, I am to him:
               
               
                  Pan.
                  Then be feareleſſe,
                  For if he were a thing twixt God and man,
                  I could gaze on him; (if I knew it ſinne,
                  
                     
To loue him) without paſſion: Dry your eyes,
                  I ſweare you ſhall enioy him ſtill for me,
                  I will not hinder you; but I perceiue
                  You are not what you ſeeme: Riſe, riſe, Thaleſtris.

                  That Lady Sir.
               
               
                  Arb.
                  It cannot be.
               
               
                  Tigr.
                  Piſh, this is tedious,
                  I cannot hold, I muſt preſent my ſelfe;
                  And yet the ſight of my Spaconia,
                  
                  Touches me, as a ſudden thunderclap
                  Does one that is about to ſinne.
               
               
                  Arb.
                  Away,
                  No more of this; here I pronounce him Traytor,
                  The direct plotter of my death that names,
                  Or thinkes her for my Siſter: Tis a lie,
                  The moſt malicious of the World, inuented
                  To mad your King; he that will ſay ſo next,
                  Let him draw out his Sword, and ſheath it here,
                  It is a ſinne fully as pardonable:
                  Shee is no kinne to me, nor ſhall ſhee be;
                  If ſhee were any, I create her none,
                  And which of you can queſtion this, my power
                  Is like the Sea, that is to be obey'd,
                  And not diſputed with: I haue decreed her
                  As farre from hauing part of bloud with me,
                  As the nak'd Indians: Come, and anſwer me,
                  He that is boldeſt now; Is that my Siſter?
               
               
                  
                  Mar.
                  O this is fine.
               
               
                  Beſ.
                  No marry is ſhee not an't pleaſe your Maieſtie:
                  I neuer thought ſhee was, ſhees nothing like you.
               
               
                  Arb.
                  No, tis true, ſhee is not:
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Thou ſhouldſt be hang'd.
               
               
                  Pan.
                  Sir, I will ſpeake but once: By the ſame power
                  You make my bloud a ſtranger vnto yours;
                  You may command me dead, and ſo much loue
                  A ſtranger may importune, pray you doe;
                  If this requeſt appeare too much to grant,
                  Adopt me of ſome other Family
                  By your vnqueſtion'd word; elſe I ſhall liue
                  Like ſinfull iſſues that are left in ſtreetes
                  By their regardleſſe Mothers, and no name
                  Will be found for me.
               
               
                  Arb.
                  I will heare no more;
                  Why ſhould there be ſuch muſicke in a voice,
                  And ſinne for me to heare it: All the world
                  May take delight in this, and tis damnation
                  For me to doe ſo; you are faire, and wiſe,
                  And vertuous I thinke, and he is bleſt
                  That is ſo neere you as your brother is:
                  But you are naught to me but a diſeaſe,
                  Continuall torment without hope of eaſe;
                  Such an vngodly ſickneſſe I haue got,
                  That he that vndertakes my cure, muſt firſt
                  Orethrow Diuinity, all morall Lawes,
                  And leaue mankinde as vnconfinde as beaſts,
                  Allowing them to doe all actions
                  As freely as they drinke, when they deſire.
                  Let me not heare you ſpeake againe; yet ſo
                  I ſhall but languiſh for the want of that,
                  The hauing which would kill me: No man here
                  Offer to ſpeake for her; for I conſider
                  As much as you can ſay: I will not toyle
                  My body, and my mind too, reſt thou there,
                  Heres one within will labour for you both.

                  I would I were paſt ſpeaking.
               
               
                  
                  Gob.
                  Feare not Madam,
                  The King will alter, tis ſome ſudden change,
                  And you ſhall ſee it end ſome other way.
               
               
                  Pan.
                  Pray God it doe.
               
               
                  Tigr.
                  Though ſhee to whom I ſwore be here, I cannot
                  Stifle my paſſion longer: If my Father
                  Should riſe againe diſquieted with this,
                  And charge me to forbeare, yet it would out:
                  Madam, a ſtranger, and a priſoner begs
                  To be bid welcome.

                  You are welcome Sir
                  I thinke, but if you be not, tis paſt me
                  To make you ſo: for I am here a ſtranger,
                  Greater then you: we know from whence you come,
                  But I appeare a loſt thing, and by whom
                  Is yet vncertaine; found here in the Court,
                  And onely ſufferd to walke vp and downe,
                  As one not worth the owning.

                  O, I feare
                  
                     Tigranes will be caught, he lookes me thinkes
                  As he would change his eyes with her; ſome helpe
                  There is aboue for me I hope.

                  VVhy doe you turne away, and weepe ſo faſt,
                  And vtter things that misbecome your lookes,
                  Can you want owning?

                  Perhaps I told you ſo,
                  If I had ſworne it, had you ſo much follie
                  To credit it: The leaſt word that ſhee ſpeakes
                  Is worth a life: rule your diſorderd tongue,
                  Or I will temper it.

                  You breake the law of Nature, and of Nations;
                  You talke to me, as if I were a priſoner
                  For theft: my tongue be temperd? I muſt ſpeake

                  You will not let your ſiſter

                  By no meanes Gobrius, I haue done her wrong,
                  And made my ſelfe beleeue much of my ſelfe,

                  Shew a contempt as large as was my owne,
                  And I will ſuffer it; yet at the laſt forgiue me.

                  Beſ.
                  They talke of fame, I haue gotten it in the warres, and will affoord any man a reaſonable penny-worth: ſome will ſay they could be content to haue it, but that it is to be atchieued with danger; but my opinion is otherwiſe: for if I might ſtand ſtill in Canon proofe, and haue fame fall vpon me, I would refuſe it: My reputation came principally by thinking to runne away, which no bodie knowes but Mardonius▪
                      and I think he conceales it to anger me. Before I went to the warres, I came to the Towne a young fellow without meanes, or parts, to deſe
                        •
                     ue friends; and my emptie guts perſwaded me to lie, and abuſe people for my meate, which I did, and they beate me: then would I faſt two dayes, till my hunger cride out on me, raile ſtill; then me thought I had a monſtrous ſtomacke to abuſe them againe, and did it. In this ſtate I continued till they hung me vp by th'heeles and beate me with haſle ſticks, as if they would haue baked mee, and haue coſen'd ſome bodie with mee for Veniſon: After this I rail'd, and 
                        •
                     ate quietlie: for the whole Kingdome tooke notice of me for a baffel'd whipt fellow, and what I ſaid, was remembred in mirth, but neuer in anger; of which I was glad,

I would it were at that paſſe againe: After this, God cald an Ant of mine, that left two hundred pounds in a Coſens hand for me, who taking me to be a gallant young ſpirit, raiſ'd a company for mee with the money, and ſent me into Armenia with vm: Away I would haue runne from them, but that I could get no company, and alone I durſt not run. I was neuer at battle but once, and there I was running, but Mardonius cudgel'd me; yet I got looſe at laſt, but was ſo afraid, that I ſaw no more then my ſhoulders doe, but fled with my whole company amongſt my enemies, and ouerthrew vm: Now the report of my valor is come ouer before mee, and they ſay I was a raw young fellow, but now I am improu'd. A plague of their eloquence, twill coſt me many a beating: And Mardonius might helpe this to if he would; for now they thinke to get honour of me, and all the men I haue abuſ'd, call me freſhly to account, worthily as they call it, by the way of challenge.

                  And a ſlight note I haue about me for you, for the deliuerie of which, you muſt excuſe me; it is an office that friendſhip calles vpon mee to doe, and no way offenſiue to you, ſince I deſire but right on both ſides.

                  An inuiting? O crie you mercie, what a complement he deliuers it with? he might as agreeablie to my nature preſent mee poyſon with ſuch a ſpeech: vm reputation, vm call you to an account, vm forſt to this, vm with my ſword, vm like a gentleman, vm deare to me, vm ſatiſfaction: Tis verie well Sir, I doe accept it, but he muſt awaite an anſwere this thirteene weekes.
               
               
                  
                  Gent.
                  Why Sir, he would be glad to wipe off his ſtaine as ſoone as hee can, Sir vpon my credit I am already ingag'd to two hundred and twelue, all which muſt haue their ſtaines wipt off, if that be the word before him.

                  Sir, if you be truly ingaged but to one, he ſhall ſtay a competent time.

                  Good morow good Sir. Certenly my ſafeſt way were to print my ſelfe a coward, with a diſcouerie how I came by my credit, and clap it vpon euery poſt: I haue receiued aboue thirty challenges within this two houres, marry all but the firſt 
                        •
                      put off with ingagement, and by good fortune the firſt is no madder of fighting then I, ſo that that's referu'd. The place where it muſt be ended, is foure dayes iourney of, and our arbytrators are there: He has choſen a gentleman in trauell, and I haue a ſpeciall friend, with a quarterne ague likely to hold him this time here, for mine; and when his man comes home, wee are to expect my friends health: If they would ſend me challenges thus thicke, as long as I liu'd I would haue no other liuing; I can make ſeauen ſhillings a day o th paper to the Grocers: yet I learne nothing by all theſe but a little skill in comparing of ſtiles. I doe find euidently that there is ſome one Scriuener in this Towne, that has a great hand in writing of challenges, for they are all of a cut, and ſix of vm in a hand; and they all end, my reputation is deare to me, and I muſt require ſatiſfaction: whoſe there? more paper I hope; no, tis my Lord Bacurius, I feare all is not well betwixt vs.

                  Tell not me of your ingagements, Captaine Beſſus; it is not to be put off with an excuſe: for my owne part, I am none of the multitude that beleeue your conuerſion from coward.

                  I will make better vſe of this, then of my ſword: A baſe ſpirit has this vantage of a braue one; it keepes alwayes at a ſtay, nothing brings it downe, not beating. I remember I promiſt the King in a great audience, that I would make my back-byters eate my ſword to a knife, how to get another ſword I know not, nor know any meanes left for me to maintaine my credit but impudence: Therefore will I outſweare him and all his followers, that this is all is left vneaten of my ſword.

See, here he is, I doe not vſe this, yet I know not how, I cannot chuſe but weepe to ſee him: his very enemies I thinke, whoſe wounds haue bred his fame, if they ſhould ſee him now, would find teares in their eyes.

                  My wrongs without more day would light me to you:
                  I muſt ſpeake ere I die; were all your greatneſſe
                  Doubled vpon you, y'are a periur'd man,
                  And onely mighty in the wickedneſſe
                  Of wronging women. Thou art ſalfe, falſe Prince,
                  I liue to ſee it: poore Spaconia liues
                  To tell thee thou art falſe; and then no more:
                  Shee liues to tell thee thou art more vnconſtant
                  Then all ill women euer were together;
                  Thy faith as firme as raging ouerflowes,
                  That no banke can command; and as laſting
                  As boyes gay bubbles blowne in the aire, and broken:
                  The wind is fixt to thee, and ſooner ſhall
                  The beaten Marriner with his ſhrill whiſtle,
                  Calme the loude murmurs of the troubled maine,
                  And ſtrike it ſmooth againe; then thy ſoule fall
                  To haue peace in loue with any: Thou art all
                  That all good men muſt hate, and if thy ſtorie
                  Shall tell ſucceeding ages what thou wert,
                  O let it ſpare me in it, leſt true Louers
                  In pitty of my wrongs burne thy blacke legend,
                  And with their curſes ſhake thy ſleeping aſhes.
               
               
                  Tigr.
                  Oh, oh:
                  The deſtinies I hope haue pointed out
                  Our ends alike, that thou maiſt die for loue,
                  
                     
Though not for me: for this aſſure thy ſelfe,
                  The Princeſſe hates thee deadly, and will ſooner
                  Be wonne to marrie with a Bull, and ſafer,
                  Then ſuch a beaſt as thou art: I haue ſtrucke
                  I feare too deepe; beſhrow me fort: Sir,
                  This ſorrow workes me like a cunning friendſhip,
                  Into the ſame piece with it; hee's aſham'd,
                  Alas▪ I haue beene too rugged: Deare my Lord,
                  I am ſorrie I haue ſpoken any thing,
                  Indeed I am, that may adde more reſtraint
                  To that too much you haue: Good Sir be pleaſ'd
                  To thinke it was a fault of loue, not malice;
                  And doe as I will doe: forgiue it Prince,
                  I doe, and can forgiue the greateſt ſinnes
                  To me you can repent of; pray belieue▪me.

                  Tigr.
                  I thanke you:
                  My vſage here has beene the ſame it was
                  Worthy a royall Conquerour. For my reſtraint
                  It came vnkindly, becauſe much vnlookt for;
                  But I muſt beare it:
               
               
                  Arb.
                  VVhat Lady is that Bacurius?

                  One of the Princeſſe women Sir.
               
               
                  Arb.
                  I feard it: why comes ſhee hether!

                  From whom Bacurius?
                  
               
               
                  Bac.
                  From the Princeſſe Sir.
               
               
                  Arb.

                  Mardo.
                  His fit beginnes to take him now againe
                  Tis a ſtrange Feauer, and twill ſhake vs all
                  Anone I feare; would he were well cur'd of this raging folly: Giue me the warres, where men are mad, and may talke what they liſt, and held the braueſt Fellowes; This pelting pratling peace is good for nothing: drinking's a vertue to it:
               
               
                  Arb.
                  I ſee theres truth in no man, nor obedience,
                  But for his owne ends, why did you let her in?
               
               
                  Bac.
                  It was your owne command to barre none from him,
                  Beſide the Princeſſe ſent her Ring Sir
                  For my warrant.
               
               
                  Arb.
                  A token to Tigranes, did ſhe not:
                  Sirra tell truth.
               
               
                  Bac.
                  I doe not vſe to lye Sir,
                  Tis no way I eate or liue by, and I thinke
                  This is no token Sir.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  This combat has vndone him: If he had beene well beaten, he had beene temperate: I ſhal neuer ſee him hanſome againe, till he haue a Horſe-mans ſtaffe poak't through his ſhoulders, or an arme broke with a Bullet.
               
               
                  Arb.
                  I am trifled with.

                  would I might doe ſo.

                  I haue found it out, this woman carries letters.

                  Gob.
                  My ſeruice, and this letter to your grace.
               
               
                  Arb.
                  From whom?
               
               
                  Go.
                  From the rich mine of vertue, and all beautie,
                  Your mournefull Siſter.

                  She is in priſon Gobrius, is ſhee not?
               
               
                  Gob.
                  She is Sir till your pleaſure doe enlarge her,
                  Which on my knees I beg; O tis not fit
                  That all the ſweetneſſe of the world in one;
                  The youth, and vertue, that would haue wilde Tygers
                  And wilder people, that haue knowne no manners
                  Should liue thus Cloyſterd vp, For your loues ſake
                  (If there be any in that Noble heart)
                  To her a wretched Ladie, and forlorne,
                  Or for her loue to you, (which is as much
                  As Nature, and obedience euer gaue)
                  Haue pittie on her beauties.
               
               
                  Arb.
                  Prethee ſtand vp, tis true ſhe is too Faire,
                  And all theſe commendations but her owne:
                  VVould thou hadſt neuer ſo commended her,
                  Or I nere liu'd to haue heard it, Gobrius;
                  
                  If thou but knew of the wrong her beautie does her,
                  Thou wouldſt in pittie of her be a lyar:
                  Thy ignorance has drawne me wretched man
                  
                     
VVhether my ſelfe nor thou canſt well tell, O my Fate,
                  I thinke ſhee loues me; but I feare another
                  Is deeper in her heart: how thinkſt thou Gobrius?
                  
               
               
                  Gob.
                  I doe beſeech your Grace beleeue it not,
                  For let me periſh if it be not falſe:
                  Good Sir reade her letter.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  This loue, or what a diuell is it, I know not, begets more miſchiefe then a wake. I had rather be we I beaten ſtaru'd, or lowſie, then liue within the aire ont. He that had ſeene this braue fellow charge through a groue of pykes but tother day, and looke vpon him now, will nere beleeue his eyes againe; If he continue thus but two daies more, a Taylor may beat him with one hand tyed behind him.
               
               
                  Arb.
                  Alas ſhe would be at libertie,
                  And there be thouſand reaſons Gobrius
                  
                  That will denie it:
                  Which if ſhe knew, ſhe would contentedly
                  Be where ſhe is and bleſſe her vertue for it,
                  And me though ſhe were cloſer, She would Gobrius,
                  
                  Good man indeed ſhe would.
               
               
                  Gob.
                  Then good Sir for her ſatisfaction
                  Send for her, and with reaſon make her know
                  VVhy ſhe muſt liue thus from you.

                  I will goe bring her to me.

                  Nay Gentlemen, and my deare friends oth' Sword,
                  No complement I pray; but to the cauſe
                  I hang vpon, which in few, is my honour.
               
               
                  2.
                  You cannot hang too much Sir for your honour,
                  But to your cauſe, be wiſe, and ſpeake truth.

                  My firſt doubt is my beating by my Prince.

                  Stay there a little Sir, doe you doubt a beating,
                  
                     
Or haue you had a beating by your Prince.
               
               
                  Beſ.
                  Gentlemen ath'ſword, my Prince has beaten me.

                  Brother what thinke you of this caſe

                  If he haue beaten him, the caſe is cleare.
               
               
                  2
                  If he haue beaten him I grant the caſe;
                  But how? VVe cannot be too ſubtill in this buſineſſe
                  I ſay, but how?

                  Euen with his royall hand.

                  Was it a blow of loue or indignation.

                  T was twentie blowes of indignation gentlemen,

                  Two blowes oth'face, and giuen by a worſe man, I muſt confeſſe as we Sword-men ſay, had turnd the buſineſſe: Marke me brother, by a worſe man; but being by his Prince, had they beene ten, and thoſe ten drawne ten teeth, beſide the hazard of his noſe for euer; all theſe had beene but fauours: This is my flat opinion, which Ile die in.
               
               
                  2.
                  The King may doe much Captaine beieeue it, for had hee crackt your skull through like a bottle, or broke a rib or two with croſſing of you, yet you had loſt no honour: This is ſtrange you may imagin; but this is truth now Captaine.
               
               
                  Beſ.
                  I will be glad to imbrace it gentleman;
                  But how farre may he ſtrike me?

                  Theres another,
                  A new cauſe riſing from the time, and diſtance,
                  In which I will deliuer my opinion:
                  He may ſtrike, beate, or cauſe to be beaten; for theſe are naturall to man: your Prince I ſay may beate you ſo farre forth as his dominion reacheth; that's for the diſtance, the time, ten mile a day▪ I take it.
               
               
                  2.
                  Brother you erre, tis fifteene mile a day,
                  His ſtage is ten, his beatings are fifteene.
               
               
                  Beſ.
                  Tis a the longeſt, but we ſubiects muſt
                  Be ſubiect to it: you are wiſe, and vertuous.

                  Obedience euer makes that noble vſe ont,

I muſt trouble you a little further Gentlemen oth' Sword.

                  No trouble at all to vs Sir, if we may

                  It ſhewed diſcretion the beſt part of valour.

                  He ſhould haue kickt him after the deliuerie,
                  Which is the confirmation of a coward.

                  In a word I ha done.

                  A tall man, but vntemperate; tis great pittie:
                  Once more ſuppoſe the boy kickt.

                  Forward.

                  So much for vs; proceede.

                  It lies ith beating Sir,

                  2.
                  The error, and a ſore one, as I take it;
                  Lies in the thing kicking.
               
               
                  Beſſ.

                  1.
                  That is according to the man that did it.

                  1.
                  The cauſe is mightie, but had it beene two Lords,
                  And both had kickt you, if you laught, tis cleere.
               
               
                  Beſſ.
                  I did laugh,
                  
                     
But how will that helpe me Gentlemen?
               
               
                  1.
                  Yes, it ſhall helpe you, if you laught alowd.
               
               
                  Beſſ.
                  As lowd as a kickt man could laugh, I laught Sir:
               
               
                  1.
                  My reaſon now; the valiant man is knowne
                  By ſuffering and contemning, you haue
                  Enough of both, and you are valiant.
               
               
                  2.
                  If he be ſure he has beene kickt enough:
                  For that braue ſufferance you ſpeake of brother,
                  Conſiſts not in a beating, and away,
                  But in a cudgeld bodie, from eighteene
                  To eight and thirtie: in a head rebuk't
                  With pots of all Size, daggers, ſtooles, and bedſtaues,
                  This ſhewes a valiant man.
               
               
                  Beſ.
                  Then I am valiant, as valiant, as the proudeſt,
                  For theſe are all familiar things to me:
                  Familiar as my ſleepe, or want of money.
                  All my whole bodi's but one bruize with beating,
                  I thinke I haue beene cudgeld with all nations,

                  Ile tell thee then: I ſhall be ſuch a creature,

                  What follie is this in thee? is it not
                  As apt to miſchiefe as it was before?
                  Can I not reach it thinkeſt thou? theſe are toyes

                  Of Fate were here, my ſword is not ſo ſure,
                  But I ſhould get it out, and mangle that
                  That all the deſtinies ſhould quite forget
                  Their fix't decrees, and haſt to make vs new
                  
                     
Farre other Fortunes, mine could not be worſe,

                  God put into your boſome temperate thoughts,
                  Ile leaue you though I feare.
                  Exit.

                  To me, and thou didſt write how well ſhee lou'd me,

                  Thy husband and the Land: Adulterous witch

                  The Serpent you haue got; there is no beaſt
                  But if he knew, it has a pedigree
                  As braue as mine, for they haue more diſcents,
                  And I am euery way as beaſtly got,
                  As farre without the compaſſe of a law,

                  And by a paire of women of her owne.
                  VVhich ſhee had charm'd, ſhee made the world belieue
                  Shee was deliuer'd of you: you grew vp
                  As the Kings ſonne▪ till you were ſixe yeere olde;
                  Then did the King die, and did leaue to me
                  Protection of the Realme; and contrarie
                  To his owne expectation, left this Queene
                  Truly with childe indeed of the faire Princeſſe

                  A Traytor, and her talke would haue beene thought
                  Madneſſe or any thing rather then truth:
                  This was the onely cauſe why ſhee did ſeeke
                  To poyſon you, and I to keepe you ſafe:
                  And this the reaſon why I ſought to kindle
                  Some ſparke of loue in you to faire Panthaea,
                  
                  That ſhee might get part of her right agen.
