loue, yt ye beare to iuſtice, whiche ye haue and do dayly declare and expreſſe to the worlde. And ſyth it hath pleaſed almyghtie God, and the kynges moſte gracious maieſtie, to conſtitute and depute you in the chiefeſt authorite and office vnder his highnes in this realme, to bee to his maieſtie in ye ſtede and lieu that Aaron was to Moyſes (the chiefe myniſter of God ouer the childrē of Iſrael) whiche is to be his graces mouth, to vtter to vs his moſte humble ſubiectes, yt his highnes ſhal receiue of God, to be to yt comē lawes of this hys realme a lifely equytee, hauīg power by your cōſciēce to ordeine remedy, wher it hath prouided none, to mytigate theſame, where it ſhal ſeme to be rigorous: we ought daily not onely to geue

prayſe & thākes to his moſt excellent goodnes for theſame, but we bee alſo bound to ſtudie & deuyſe to our power, howe ſo iuſte and vertuous an offycer maye longe continue emong vs. For as they that beare good wyll, and loue to the comen wealth mooſte reioyſe and be glad, whē iuſtyce and the lawes be iuſtly executed and myniſtred, and hertely deſire that they may be ſo maynteyned and kepte as pyllers withoute the whiche no publique weale can ſtāde, no, nor any lytle famyly cā endure. So ought they to be ioyfull, when the rulers and myniſters therof bee in healthe & proſperitee hable to execute theſame: and beſydes to ſtudye and endeuour how they maye ſo cōtynue. For as a woman that hathe no

hed nor gouernour is lytle hable to gouerne and rule her ſeruaūtes, if thei be froward: ſo can iuſtice & lawe litle do in a comen wealthe, where people be euill diſpoſed, yf thoſe lacke yt ſhuld ſupporte, maynteyne and put theim in execucion.

And as Iethro ſeeyng Moyſes ouermuche troubled in hearyng the peoples ſuites and cauſes, ſaied: It is not well dooen thus to conſume and waſte your ſelfe: So maye

                bee

iuſtly ſaied to ſuche as bee in authoritee and office, hauyng their mynde ſo fixed to the expedicion of cauſes, that they regarde not their healthe: Ye dooe not well, thus to coſume your ſelfes. For as in a campe or army, no ſouldiour maye departe without licence and paſporte of his Capitayne, but muſt ſo vſe hym ſelfe whyle he is there, as he maye bee at all times ready and hable to ſerue at commaundement, ſo ought euery chriſten man to lead his life in this world, not to ſeke or laboure to bee out of it, not to ſhorten his daies, but to tary vnto ſuch tyme as he ſhall haue licence and paſporte of the Lorde almighty, and not in the meane ſeaſon to make his bodye feble and weake, that he ſhall not bee hable to do that

he is elected and called vnto.
            
               Plato ſaieth that Aeſculapius (who for his excellēt knowlage in phiſyk is called God therof) would not that ſuche as profeſſed yt facultie and ſcyence, ſhould enterpriſe or take in hand to cure ſuche as wer of nature ſubiecte to diſſeaſes, or had gotten ſikneſſe willingly by intēperaunce, although they wer neuer ſo ryche. The one, becauſe they engendred & begate chyldren lyke theim ſelfes, that is feble, weake, ſyckely, not hable to ſerue in the common wealthe. And the other, for yt they wyllingly vnhabled theim ſelfes to ſerue therin, and yet beſides conſumed that others lacked, who wer both hable & wylling. But men ſomtyme wyllingly muſt bryng their

bodies out of temper, & ſoneſt of all ſuche as bee great rulers and Counſailours, who for ye ſafete of the hoole cōmen wealth be enforced vpon preſente occaſion, to prouide preſent remedye, to dooe thinges out of hand, which without great daunger will not tarye time, whom neither Aeſculapius nor any man that hath reaſon, would to bee without redreſſe. For the whiche cauſe many excellent clerkes aſwell in other ſciences as in phiſycke, haue deuiſed how to reſtore ſuche mēne to their priſtyne ſtate and health of body, & emong others the exellent clerke & graue Philoſopher Plutarchus Chaeronenſis bothe Scholemaiſter and Counſailour vnto the moſt vertuouſly diſpoſed Emperoure of all Gentiles

And that the cold of the extreme partes of the bodye, whyle it dyd dryue the heate inwarde, dyd induce a famylyaritee & cuſtome of the feuer. On the other parte in caſe thoſe thynges, that come outewardely vnto ye extreme partes dooe brynge and beſtowe the matter together wyth the heate through all the bodye,

by vppon the ſame dooe eftſons put it to aſmuch payne as it is able to beare. For nature deſyreth not ſuche patching and botching of the body, but the folyſh mynde rather beyng intēperate and vnnaturall.
