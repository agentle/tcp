lord & maſter Edward de Vere Earle of Oxenford,
vicount Bulbecke, lord of Eſcales & Badleſmere,
& Lord great Chamberlayne of England.
Iohn Farmer wiſheth long and happie life with
encreaſe of honor.
            
               IT was mine exerciſe, right
honorable and my ſinguler
good Lord, to make
vppon a playnſong not
long a goe fortie ſeuerall
waies of 2. parts in one,
with what cōmendation,
I ſhall then perceiue, when other ſhall haue
iudged, with what ſtudy, my ſelfe am priuie:
neither long, nor ſerious. This poore conceit I
haue preſumed of your honorable fauour to
preſent vnto your Lordſhip: vnder couerture
of whome, to the view of the world: not but
that I knew it, vnworthie of ſo high a perſonage,
but rather that it needed the more noble
patronage, the leſſe is in it to recōmend it ſelfe,
which how litle it is, I am greatly in feare Hervnto,
my good Lord, I was the rather emboldened
for your L. great affection to this noble

                  ••
               ience, hoping for the one you might pardō
               
                  〈◊〉
                other, & deſirous to make knowē your inclination
this way. For howſoeuer my ſkill be

nothing ſuch, as in leaſt part to expreſſe the
dignitie of the art, yet this I am ſure of, if graue
auctors haue rightly informed mee, that the
wiſest men as Pythagoras & Plato, haue made
it their ſtudie, and moſt honorable perſons as
Hercules and Achilles, their earneſt practiſe.
Beſides this, my good Lord, I beare this conceit,
that not onelie my ſelf am vowed to your
commaundement, but all that is in me is dedicated
to your Lordſhips ſeruice: ſo that, albeit
I am vnable to make ſhew of my deuty in ſuch
ſort, as I wiſh: yet to tranſport to other, what I
owe to your Lordſhip I demeed not to ſitte
with ſuch a profeſſion. Onelie if it ſhall pleaſe
your honorable minde to meaſure my deede
by my deſire, it may happily ſeeme ſomewhat,
which of it ſelfe is leſſe then nothing. Which
beſeeching your Lordſhip with all inſtancie,
and as before hoping, ſo now moſt humbly
crauing pardon of my preſumption, I reſt in
prayer for the preſeruation of your honour in
long life, and great happyneſſe, in the one to
match the oldeſt, in the other the bleſſeddeſt.
            
               Your Lordſhips moſt bounden
ſeruaunt, and at all commaundement
moſt ready.
Iohn Farmer.
            
         
         
            
            
               Philomuſicis.
            
            
               MAruaile not gentlemen, who
ſoeuer ſhal ſee this little book,
that Muſicke ſhewes hir ſelfe
in this vnuſuall vayne. For if
in other arts it be a common
practiſe (and yet not ſo ordinarie
as commendable) euerie
way to deuiſe to further the
ſtudie of each perticuler, why
ſhould Muſicke be denied that, which is graunted
the reſt? Certes how men do thinke of hir, I do not
know (I doubt but baſſely) how they ſhould I am
out of doubt, that is moſt honourablie. No man can
denie, but that God is authour, as of all other excellent
qualities, ſo of this (for ſo euen the Philoſophers,
who had not right knowledge of the heauenlie
maieſtie, by inſtinct of nature did ſee and confeſſe)
and as of the 7. liberall ſciences, which therefore haue
that name, becauſe they are befitting men of moſt
free birth, ſhe is one in number, ſo peraduenture,
nay, without peraduenture not the laſt, if not the
firſt, in dignitie: for delight wonderfull, for depth
infinite, for commoditie it may happilie be doubted,
whether any more neceſſarie. Were it not ſo, it
had not beene to write, which Tullie writes truelie
of the countrie of Graecia, where being the
fountaine of all learning, and the verie ſeate of wisdome,
ſic Muſici floruerunt, as he ſaith, vt omnes id
diſcerent, nec, qui neſciebat, ſatis excultus doctrina putaretur.
In the ſame countrie Themiſtocles a Prince of

               Athens, for that at a feaſt he refuſed to play on the
Harpe, an inſtrument at that time of higheſt credit,
although in other reſpects in a maner peereleſſe, onely
for this defect, was thought ſomewhat rude. The
ende of my ſpeech and purpoſe is this, that the ſcience
being ſo excellent, and yet ſo couldlie followed,
euerie one that knowes any thing of her, ſhould euerie
waie be doing for her aduauncement, and ſuch
as are not, are greatly in her debt, ſuch as are, are
fauorably to be accepted, howſoeuer it be not each
mans fate to performe what is ſinguler. I profeſſe (if
any leſſe wiſe, then I could wiſh them, miſconstrue
my meaning) to doe nothing of oſtentacion (for alas
what is this, nay what haue I in me, whereof iuſtlie
to boſt?) I was in hope that ſtudents in this art, ſuch
as may learne, as my ſelfe may, and haue not yet proceeded
ſo farre as I haue, might finde ſomthing heere
not vnworthie their labor. If it ſo fall out, I ſhall be
glad, if otherwiſe, it was the error of myne opinion,
which I deſire may be pardoned to my good will, ſo
ſhall I endeuour my ſelfe to continue my poore labours,
without repentance for this I haue done. Fare
yee well.
