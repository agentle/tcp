               Aug. ep. 3. Nullorum disput. &c.
               We ought to haue no men their disputations (although men Catholike and praise worthie) in that count as we haue the Canonicall Scriptures: so that it should be vnlawfull for vs to improue and refuse some things in their writings, if happily we finde that they thought otherwise then the truth hath. Such a one am I in other mens writings, and so would I haue others to vnderstand of my writings.

            Principall positions proued in the discourse of the Parable.
            
               1 That the kingdom of heauen (Math. 13.24.) it is not vsed for the
state of the world, but of the new Testaments Church.
               2 That the Church is Catholike, and in some measure euer visible in
this life.
               3 That the Church of Christ was planted here in England, in the Apostles
times: and continued notably vncorrupted till about, Anno
Domini. 600.
               4 That Anti-christianitie (or the marke of the beast) it is not considered
in separable accidentall corruption in faith or manners: but
in that is essentiall and fundamentall.
               5 That the Tares in this Parable are wicked within the Church, and
visible to the gouerners thereof.
               6 That the Tares are onely such wicked as cannot with Churches
peace and safetie be pulled vp.
               7 That such Tares are of holy pollicie to be permitted: and yet no defilement
to spirituall communion.

So that I (if any) haue cause to auow allegiance (not Tam Marti quam Mercurio, but) to the Christian subiects of Wisdome and Valour. The schedule I present, it is an exposition of that 
                  Mat. 13 24. &c.
                Parable of Tares, propounded by our Lord and Master Christ Iesus. Wherein is considered, first, the glorious estate of the New-testaments Church, first planted throughout the world by the Ministerie of the Apostles: then secondly, the corruption thereof through Ministers sleepie negligence: yea, the corruption so deeply setled therein, as well it might be in these latter times Reformed, but neuer quite purged of visible euill (nor Replanted) vntill the Sonne of man in his great day of haruest, doe that by the ministerie of his Angels. A doctrine so necessary, as without the knowledge thereof, a man shall either rush on the error of the right hand (through desperate vn-bridled Zeale) or on that on the left hand, through a frozen cold securitie.

Sure, he shall beare his iniquitie. These two lawes haue enforced me, first publikely to preach; then secondly to publish the sequell in print. And so much the more, as the former two decrees of mount Sion, they concerne neerer then many.
            In my first looking after religion,A ground of the Authors aberration. my lot was to associate such onely, as onely tasted and affected another kind of ministerie, which (as they said) yet we had not in England. And that they tearmed the ministerie of Pastor, Doctor, Elders, Deacons, Widowes, due to euerie particular Church. Those words I soone learned: as also, that the Pastor was to exhort, the Doctor to teach or deliuer doctrine, the Elders to gouerne and exercise the disciplinall cens

               res in common with Pastor and Doctor, the Deacons onely to attend poore and loue-feastes, the widowes to wait on the sicke.
            That platforme once swallowed, I then was easily perswaded that our Bishops, their Ordinations and all ministerie standing vnder them, it was Antichristian, and an Image of the beast. And looke how many corruptions, so many markes of the beast, which whosoeuer receiued in forehead or hand,

euen all such should drinke of the cup of the wine of God his wrath.
            
               The authors voyages, yet he could be resolued.All this so hanging togither, except I would practise contrarie to my perswasion, (as many deceitfully haue done) out of the land I must, as I loued my libertie. I did so. First into the Low-countries I went, Afterwards into Scotland. After that againe into the Low-countries. Then again into Scotland: And once againe into Netherland, &c. Sometimes haled by this faction, sometimes pulled by that faction. But (the Lord being mercifull vnto me) howsoeuer I was notablie distract about externall Church-gouernment, yet (as all my printed bookes will testifie) I kept me euer fast vnto the maine point, that is,The time when, and Bishop by whom he was ordained to Presbyteral function. vnto the foundation of the Gospell, I had before here receiued: and had in Lancashire for some two yeares publikely ministred, being before (now some nine yeares since) ordained fully thereto by Bishop Wicham then Bishop of Lincolne.
            About some fiue years since, it pleased God to giue me an earnest desire to search antiquitie,A meanes for his setling and reducement. if happily that way I might find any assured footing of scriptures sence, touching externall Church orders. Togither with this desire, the Lord afforded me plentie of bookes, first in Scotland, after in Netherland. The more I read those writers that liued in the first 400 years, the more I perceiued the former scales to fall from mine eies. And as the light of the faithfull increaseth till it be perfect day; so, togither with my last returne for England, the foggie mist was risen and fled, the Sunne of righteousnesse shined vpon me: and that (to the praise of God be it spoken) in such euidence of scripture, as I hope my selfe enabled to draw (as on a table) an euident Idea and shape of that miscarying way, if so men will waigh it in simplicitie of spirit. Yet this must here be done but briefly according to the nature of an epistle.
            
               Pastors and Doctors, their late description of offices, too to fantastical and new.Pastor and Doctor are distinguished by them (from Rom. 12.7.8.) by exhortation and doctrine. The Doctor is to be first exercised in doctrine, the Pastor in the second place is to exhort from that doctrine. From hence then must needs follow: first, that the Doctor is aboue the Pastor; seeing the Pastor

but buildeth vpon the doctrine of his Doctor: Euen as the Apostles laying the foundation, then were in an higher office then the Euangelistes or Pastors that but builded on the Apostles ground. And for this consideration, the Apostle Paul would not worke vpon others building. The order then must be thus; Doctor, Pastor. And in Rom. 12.7. Doctrine indeed is put before exhortation. Secondly, if doctrine and exhortation distinguish them, then it shall be as verily sinne for the Doctor in his exercise to meddle with exhortation, or for the Pastor to meddle with doctrine, as it was for Vzzah an inferiour Leuit to touch the Arke of God (though in a danger to fal) which medling with the Arke distinguished Aarons family, from the other two Leuits. Thirdly, then it skilleth not though the Pastor be a man of no learning (for all the learning to speake of, lieth in a deliuerie of the scriptures naturall sense, with a drawing out of his proper doct
                  •
               ines) and to exhort, is so farre inferiour to doctrine, as the application of the medicine (to a seen sore) doth vtter no such knowledge, as the prouision and composition of the medicine. If they say, the Pastor is to exhort, but not onely, he may also teach: the like (say I) with as good reason may be spoken of the Doctor, not onely to teach, but principally. Which toyish order of teaching & exhorting, as no reformed Church abroad is acquainted with it (for they acknowledge no sole Doctor, but of the schooles) so their distinction of Not onely, but principally, as it may be vsed likewise in the following offices, so let vs see how much it maketh for them.
            The Elders they distinguish by Ruling (from 1. Tim. 5.17.) as the Pastor and Doctor,Their Lay-Elders as fond. by the word and doctrine. Here say they, are both sorts of Elders: Rulers in the first place, teachers in the second. First, touching the term
                  •
               s (word and doctrine) doctrine being onely that which is drawne from the word, here so is no speech of the Pastor and his exhortation: and so no double honour for the Pastor. Secondly, if by Ruling in the first place, be meant onely a gouerning of the Church without doctrine, then the deliuerer of the word and doctrine last mentioned, he must be debarred Rule▪ rule appertaining to the

first; doctrine, to the second. If it be replied, that the Pastor and Doctor also are to rule though not principally: so others may aswell reply, the Elders are not onely (though principally) to be exercised in Ruledome, for they also may teach. That the Elders might onely rule, not teach; though they make him a Bishop (in english Ouerseer) yet they will vnderstand him vnder the word Deacon: for thus it is in the demonstration of discipline.

            Marke well, how first he maketh two sorts of Bishops (Pastors and Doctors) then two sorts of Deatons; Ouerseers and distributors. First, a right plaine man may obserue, that to make an Ouerseer (or gouerning Elder) to be a Church-seruant, it is verie ridiculous. Secondly, to make Bishops one in the first diuision, & Ouerseers another in the second diuision: it is to make a difference between I and I: that is, a difference where none is. For Bishops and Ouerseers are all one: Bishops being the Greeke word, and Ouerseers the English. The diuision so of the offices, not onely void of diuinitie and art, but also of verie common sense. Yet a correction due to the sons of God, when they seeke to bring in their owne inuentions. But to what purpose haue they thrust the word Ouerseer vnder the word Deacon? Because forsooth in 1. Tim. 3. they would not vnderstand the office of Elders in the word Bishop: because it is there required, that euerie Bishop (or Church ouerseer) he should be Apt to teach: and they would haue Elders of another stampe. Whereas that in 1. Tim. 3.1.2. (together with Act. 20.17. where Elders are by vers. 28. expounded Ouerseers or Bishops, on all which the Apostle enioyneth teaching as he before had) it plainly euinceth, that all Ouerseers are to be exercised in teaching. By both which plaine places, that more obscure place in 1. Tim. 5.17. (They that rule well are worthie double honour, specially they that tyre themselues in the word and doctrine) it must be vnderstood, either of one and

the same sort of Elders in the Church; whereof all deseruing well, some (by reason of more trauaile) deserue better: or else (whereto I rather condescend) the first is spoken of Ouerseers to a particular Church: the latter (for Kopiontes importeth we ari
                  •
               omenes by trauelling to and fro, as in Iohn, Ch. 4. vers. 6.) it implieth such Elders as Paul, Iohn, Peter, & others that trauelled from place to place, hauing care ouer many churches.
            Touching the Deacons (who are to be employed onely in and about the poore and tables) I take that onely were better (as before) turned into principally:Their Deac
                     ••
                   mutilation. and that by reason of more sufficient teachers present, as also such occasion about the tables and poore, as was in Ierusalem at the time of their first institution. But that there is no time nor place for the Deacon to preach and baptize, the scripture affordeth not that. The contrarie appeareth in Philip, preaching and baptizing in Samaria, before the Apostles came thither to promoue him into an Euangelists place: or yet the Angell had called him to any busines with the Eunuch. Besides, seeing the scripture requireth such a one to hold the mysterie of faith, to be full of the holy ghost, and of wisedome, it plainly argueth, it is, because he may assist in that busines. And seeing (by all probability) those seuen Deacons were of the 70 disciples (for then they were in that Church; and be sure that the people would choose the best) it cannot be auoided, but Deacons must be fitted that way: that so ministring well, they may be preferred in time to a greater degree.

For euerie child knows that He is not a She. The Brownists to couer this foppery, they say not Widowes, but Relieuers: that so vnder this new word they may steale into y• Church, Widowers: so well as Widowes. Yet, where it is said, they should attend on sicke, as scripture speaketh of no such matter; so, if we remember that she must not be vnder 60. years aged, as also one that hath no helpe from her kindred, it should seeme to me, that she is rather receiued to be ministred vnto, then to minister.

Yet because first abroad, and now at home I resist those nouelties according to knowledge: the Brownists abroad sparse notable vntruthes against me (witnes those, to whom my treatise of the sinne against the holy ghost is dedicate) and the seditious at home quickly sup vp the euomitings of the Brownist, that so thereby they may defile me and my ministery.

Common doctrines of ordinarie course I here haue omitted, holding me (for the most part) vnto certaine grounds of controuersie, by the which disquieted soules may be setled. I choose this Parable before other scriptures, because it is a ground of grounds for direction vnto Churches state and condition: the verie scripture which many peruert to their owne ruine: and yet (ni malè memini) the first scripture whereby I recouered my standing. Pray in humilitie yet thou read. Read without preiudicate affection. Ponder what thou readest: But giue no definitiue sentence, before thou haue read the whole.

            Math. 13.24. Another Parable put he forth vnto them, &c.
            
               SEeing speech is here of a Parable, it would be considered, first, whether the word carie with it mo senses then one in Canonicall writ: and then, in what sense it is peculiarly vttered.
            For varietie of sense, I rest well resolued in that auncient collection of the Greeke father Chrysostome: who vpon the 48. Psalme according to the Septuagints or Greeks account (for they ioyne the 9. and 10. Psalms in one; with vs and the Hebrew distinctly two: and then for keeping the number of 150. psalmes, they cut the 147. psalme into two: beginning their 148. with the 12. verse, Laud the Lord O Ierusalem, &c. which account the old Latine also obserueth) on the same 48. psalme, he collecteth two senses from the olde Testament, according to the Septuagints version: and other two senses in the new Testaments Greeke: that is, foure senses in the whole.
            In the olde Testament, he first obserueth it for a Rebuke or opprobrie: as where in psalme 44. we read, Thou hast set vs for a Parable, that is, for a by-word or marke of rebuke. And in Iudges 14.14. it is taken for a Riddle: where of Samson Be-dan (sprong of Dan) it is written, Out of the eater came sweet, &c. which in vers. 12. is termed well a Riddle, but in the Greeke, a Parable. In the new Testament lieth other two senses, which Hysteron proteron (for methode sake) I rehearse thus. In Hebr. 11.19. (speech hauing passed of Abraham his offering Isaac) it is said, That from the dead he receiued him (En parabole) in a Parable or type; or (as we haue it well) after a sort. The fourth sense is that which here in Mathew is vsed, and that is for a Similitude: as if he should haue said, Another similitude Iesus he put forth vnto them. Wherin if we obserue, first the partie which propounds

the parable; then secondly, the parties to whom it is propounded, it shall carrie with it his proprietie of edification.
            The propounder is Iesus, in plaine English, Math. 8.21. He that was appointed to saue his people from their sin: appointed by God the father to saue the whole Israel of God. The heroicke condition of his person (essentially God, essentially man, by true distinction of natures, constituting but one person, Mediatour Christ) it may cause vs with more reuerent attention to listen his similitude. For sentences deliuered by persons of state, they ordinarily stand for Maximes of mightie consequent. And if we consider his inestimable loue towards his people, that may moue vs more: for who will not be vrged by a sweet and trustie friend? But if it be remembred, that he is not onely our mightie friend, but also He, whom the Prophets call Isa. 9.6. 
               Counsailor, and the Pro. 8. & 9. Psa. 104.24. 
               Wisedome of God in whom the whole worke of Creation restes, surely, this may be a furtherance, (not onely to attention, but also) to perswasion for a readie receipt of those words of wisedome.
            Touching the parties to whom this Sauiour of ours speaketh, it is the multitude, his disciples not exempted. The Parable vnexpounded, is principally because of the people; concerning whom the scripture had foretold Vers. 14. &c. 
               That in hearing they should not vnderstand, and seeing they should not perceiue, because of the fatnes of their hearts, &c. So that our Sauiour vseth not Parables so, but when he hath warrant of scripture: nor fat hearted and insensible soules are not so spoken vnto, but when scripture will be so verified vpon them. Our Sauiours enigmaticall speeches may teach vs to obserue the times (and so Origen and others do read, Rom. 12.11. Seruing (Kairô) Time, not (Kuriô) the Lord) considering, Prou. 25.11. 
               A word spoken in his place, is like Apples of Gold and pictures of Siluer. Vnto some, holy mysteries are to be sealed: but vnto leane hearted disciples, and such as will not play the hogs and dogs with pearles, the written mysteries of God are to be reuealed. His truthes are not like Isis and Osyris mysteries in Aegypt, who are to be locked vp in the bosomes of their sacred priests. Indeed, the priests of spirituall Aegypt do locke vp all from the people in an vnknowen

tongue, saying: that Hosius de expresso verbo Dei. 
               The people are swine and dogs, and holy things are not to be giuen vnto them. But no people are we to terme so, who minister an outward hope (though mixed with infirmitie) of being truly desirous to heare and vnderstand, not for cauillation but for edification.
            And seeing a Parable or similitude expounded, it is the plainest doctrine or forme of teaching of all others (seeing it hath allusion to common naturall things, where with man is well acquainted) as also, considering with the plainnes there is an eloquence naturall ioyned for beautification thereof vnto the eye of nature; it should teach all ministers herein sometimes to be exercised, as was Salomon that great preacher of Israell: for of him (carying a representation of our Iesus) it is thus written: Eccle. 12.9.10. 
               The wiser the preacher, the more he taught the people knowledge, and caused them to heare, and searched forth and prepared many Parables. The preacher sought to find out pleasant words and an vpright writing, euen the words of truth. Yet, seeing Parables of themselues doe not naturally conclude or proue, but onely explaine and illustrate doctrine alreadie proued (euen as in all schooles the axiome runs: Similia illustrant non probant: Similies do beautifie, but proue not) therefore Parables must be no further pressed then may be found consonant to the analogie or proportion of faith. And for this cause, they may be termed as one well termed Aliegories, namely, Zuingl. on his 52 art. 
               Sawces which none eate alone, but for seasoning of meat. So much briefly for the terme Parable, now to the matter so termed. It followeth in the text.
            
               Vers. 24. The kingdome of heauen is like, &c.] Euerie comparison consisteth (as Greekes speake) of his Protasis and Apodosis: that is, of his proposition and reddition. The proposition is the thing propounded, the reddition is the application thereof. Here we haue to resolue the Parable thus: Looke how it befalleth a field first sowen with wheat, where into afterwards steps the enemie and scattereth his tares, &c. Euen so it befalleth with the kingdome of heauen. In the 12. Mat. 12.43.44.45. Chapter of this present Euangell, our Sauiour propoundeth a person out of whom the vncleane spirit goeth, but afterwards returneth to a stronger

possession of that soule: he then applieth it to that generation saying: Euen so shall it be with this wicked generation. But his methode here contrariwise, euen so it shall befall the kingdome of heauen, As vnto a field sowen, &c. Placing that in the first place, which by the former president should naturally come in the second place. And this to teach vs, to vse and not to vse a naturall methode: that is, to our Christian libertie herein; not to make our selues slaues to one forme, when Christ hath made vs free. And yet this no cloake for ignorant bablers, who oft speake despitefully of methode; not because they know what it is (for it may be they are void of all Art and learning) but because literature hath no such enemie as ignorance. But let vs come vnto the thing compared.
            
               The kingdome of heauen is like, &c.] To the sense of these words, first seuerally, then ioyntly. The word Kingdome (as is also the Hebrew and Greeke) it is deriued of the word King, as being the thing where abouts a King is exercised. And which more is, I take it to be compounded of King and Doome, (and so by contraction Kingdome) because hereabouts a King doth exercise his doome or iudgement. Vnto which kingdomes Constitution is required, first a King; secondly a People; thirdly Doome, iudgements or lawes; fourthly, an Execution therof according to equitie. Which I passe by, as ordinarie common places.
            Touching the word Heauen (or rather as it is in the originall So the Hebrew (Shammajim) plural. (Ouranôn) Heauens in the plurall number) it is sometimes taken for the ayre (as when we say, Frigidum Coelum, a colde heauen, that is, a cold ayre: or as the birds are said of Gen. 1.20. 
               Moses to flie in the open stretching forth of the heauens) sometimes it is taken onely for stretched out spheres, globes or seuerall circles wherein the stars be. Of which, some be termed in the Greeke, Iude. 13. 
               Planets, in english, Wanderers, because of their swift and speedie motion: and those be seuen in number, wherof the Moone (the lowest) and the Sunne (the middlemost) are principall to vs ward for operation. But the one and the other restrained from Psal. 121.6. 
               Smiting those that put their confidence in Israels God: not (as Ier. 10.2. 
               the heathen doe) fearing the heauens face as a

God. The other heauens are eyther the firmament wherein all the common stars be (commonly termed fixed) whereto Iehouah willeth Gen. 15.

               Abraham to cast his eye, telling him, so infinite should his seed bee. In which firmament are the stars, whereof the Lord speaketh to Iob, namely, Plejades, Orion, Matzaroch, Arcturus. Or else they be heauens inuisible, beyond the reach of our sight, whereof to dispute it is not fitting this place. Yet so farre as God reuealeth his workes vnto vs, so farre we may search, and with humilitie enquire for our comforts: yea, that so thereby we may so much the more be pricked to praise him in his workes: so much for the words seuerally, now ioyntly.
            The Kingdome of heauen, it being a phrase not fully found in those syllables, in any one place of the olde Testament, we are to seeke the originall vse thereof in the newe. The first Preacher of this phrase, it is Iohn Baptist in this present gospell, and Chap. 3.2. where he cries, Repent, for the kingdome of heauen is at hand. In which speech he hath relation vnto that kingdome whereof Daniel speaketh, Chap. 7.14. giuen by the ancient of daies vnto One like the sonne of Man: which in vers. 22. & 27. he communicates with the Saints of the most high, a kingdome after the receipt and possession thereof, appointed to endure for euer. Whereunto if we adde that to the Hebrewes, touching the remouall of the olde heauens and earth (that is,Heb. 12.27.28. of the Iewish Church and pollicie) that so a new kingdome might be receiued of the faithfull that should neuer be shaken, it shall so appeare euidently, that the kingdome of heauen here spoken of, it is no other thing then the state of the newe Testaments Church, whereto Iohn Baptist prepared the way, and baptized. Yea, that this conclusion is Catholike and subscribed vnto of all, euerie one that is read, can well enough testifie.
            The state of new Testaments Church it being so called, we therby may collect the grosse darkned iudgement of the world, who takes it rather for a kingdome of hell, then of heauen: and the rather because the appendices of this kingdome or Commonwealth are like to Iesus incarnate: that is, Isa. 53.2.3. 
               Out of a drie ground, void of for me and beautie

and therefore a Kingdome like to the King, not of this world: but rather alotted to hang on the Crosse by the hands of the world. And for this cause, the Psalmist saith that, Psal. 45.

               inceth many of ignorance: who contrarie to scripture, all antiquitie and experience doe affirme, that there hath beene no visibilitie of the Church for former hundreds of yeares. Besides that, such a position is opposite to all those scriptures, Psal. 72.5.17. Isa. 59.21. Math. 16.11. 1. Tim. 3.18. Reuel. 11.2.3. (for as the Centurists well reason, if it continue vnder Antichristes tyrannie and exaltation, much more after) but also, it is an embasing of this kingdome before the kingdome of Moses. For, was not the ancient Church (the figure and type hereof) was it not alwaies visible? No, saie our ignorant Reformists and Schismatikes. The Church was inuisible in the time of Elias. But the Lord saith no: Rom. 11.3▪4.5. First, by rebuking the Prophet, pronouncing vnto him that there were 7000. in Israell that did no outward homage vnto Baal. Nor let a man iudge otherwise it could be, seeing not onely there were plentie of Prophets when Obadiah hid them by 50. and 50. in a caue; but also, 2. King. 2.
                     •
                  .5.7. &c. there were schooles of Prophets what time Elias was readie to be rapt vp. Secondly, the holy Ghost recordeth Elijah to haue spoken against Israel, not against Iudah. For as he knew that good Iosaphat at that time raigned in Iudah, so he wel knew, that there was not only the church visible, but also mightily reformed. Nor can I but wonder that man can read the third Chapter of 
                  Luke 3 23. &c. 
               Luke, where the principall starres of the Church from the first Adam to the second are genealogically numbred, and yet after the reading thereof, not to see that euen in them the Church was ay visible.
            
               But those peruerters vnable to answer those scriptures, they will now presse me with men (although at no hand we may presse them with men) and that thus: To teach the Church ay visible, is to teach Poperie, and all our learned men haue alleadged this of Elijah against that doctrine, &c. I answer, it is false: not onely all ancients euer hold the Churches Euer-visibilitie, but also, all learned men of our age, (amongst the rest read Caluin his Institutions, booke 4. Chap. 2. Section. 12. and Chap. 7. Sect. 25. Peter Martyr in his common places, Classis. 4. Sect. 41. place 6. the foure Centurists in Centurie 1. booke 2. Chap. 4. Also our Nowell on the Article, Communion of Saints, &c.) to which purpose our mē against the Romanists haue commonly vrged that of Tertullian (Tertul. exhort. ad castitat. 
               Vbitres, Ecclesia est, etiamsi Laici) A Church is where but three be, although they be Lay-people. They haue not alledged Elijahs complaint against Israel for prouing al nullity of Churches visibility (for that is not the question betweene vs and Papists) but it is alledged against visible Constitution of Church in Israel. The Romanists vrging their Church for vniuersall, and ay constituted according to the first patterne of externall pollicie, we affirme that the new Testaments Church sometimes looseth such visibilitie of vniuersalitie and externall constitution: euen as the ancient Church her figure did. If we consider typicall Israel, first we see her great and glorious going out with army of banners. Anone ten parts fall away, though midst these ten God ay stirred vp Prophets and prouoked some to an essentiall obedience at home, destitute of Iudahs sacrifices, and Church pollicie. Anone the two tribes goe into Babel, and Ierusalem is trampled vnder foote for many sabaoths. Yet the Church visible (true Iewes and true Prophets) though Priest and Teraphim ceased. Anone they returne backe by Cyrus, but still trampled vnder foot by Persians, Grecians, Seleucians. And all out of order when Messiah came: yea, high-priests made by Herod, that were not of Aarons line, as Iosephus

                  lan, Iunius, Napeir haue well obserued) during which time our Church was in the midst of Babel: and the man of sin exalted in the midst of it. Which point obserued, it not onely stoppeth the Romanists mouth demaunding of vs, what are become of Grandfathers and Grandmothers? but also it dammeth vp a foule stream that carieth many head-long into Schisme, expecting euerie sect a new forme of Churches beginning. Whereas alas, it may be reformed and purged, but no more is to be planted as at first it was by the Apostles▪ For as the beginning of plantation was euer practised by miraculous ministers (witnesse Moses and Aaron to Israel, and the Apostles to the new Testaments kingdome) so besides that, it was to incommend vnto such Churches new lawes for the substance therof, which before they had not. As for vs Christians, we receiued such a kingdome, as for the substance thereof, it hath euermore preuailed against infernall powers.
            And gladly I would know of our Schismatikes, if so the Being vnder Romes gouernment, it simply or essentially caused all such to be limmes of Antichrist; and that to be the beastes marke for the which all such should drinke of the wine of God his wrath, I would then demaund of them: First, where the Church then for 1000. yeares hath been visible; and so consequently, what assurance they haue that their present faith for the substance therof hath preuailed? They can make no answer but against all scripture. Secondly, I would know of them why the corrupt gouernment of Rome should make all vnder it Antichristian; and then the Reuel.

Which opposite ground as it was long in laying, so it was fully setled by thē in that infamous Held in Anno Dom. 1545 Councell of Trident.

For the vnderstanding whereof, let vs heare what exposition our Sauiour himselfe giueth hereon. In verse 37. he saith, He that soweth the good seed is the sonne of man. And in the next verse, And the field is the world, and the good seed they are the children of the kingdome. A certaine poore soule once ignorant how any open wicked might vpon any occasion be suffered once to grow in the Church, he makes such an exposition here, as whereby he may shut Tares quite out of the Church, for thus he writes, M. Bar. in his Disc. pag. 19. 
               Did not God at first make the world, and all things in the same good? was it not corrupted, &c. to this question I answer, it is true, he did so: but this is not consonant to this place: for the Sonne of man is not God the Creator, but God the Redeemer, neuer called Sonne of man vntill he was incarnate. So that here is no speech of worlds Creation, but of Christ Iesus incarnate: who by his owne ministerie and the ministerie of his Apostles did plant the childrē of the kingdome or new Testaments Church in the face of the whole world: and this by preaching the word of the kingdome, termed also the immortall seed of God. For here is no comparison framed to the world, but to the kingdome of heauen, the state of the new Testaments Church.

And this by ancient Gildas testimonie should be in the yeere of Christ, 60. Gildas sapiens de excidio Britanniae. Who also saith that they suffered a notable persecution here by Diocletian Romes Emperour. The excellent Theodoret writeth, Theod. l. 9. de cur. Graec. affect. that the Apostle Paul (presently after deliuerance out of his first captiuitie at Rome) hee came then hither. This Apostle in his second Epistle to Timothie and last Chapter, he remembreth one Claudia an excellent christian woman then at Rome, whom Martial the Poet affirmeth to be of Brittaine, thus:

            In a word, the ancient Registers haue so vniformely consented in this point (namely, that Britannia in the Apostles times it receiued the holy faith: as also that the Ministers were maried, nor after 600. y. (what time Austin the Monke came hither from Rome) could or would giue any hope of yeelding therein to Romes perswasion, whose Cities Ministerie then was much gone out of the way) this point I say, is so vniformely witnessed, as our Schismatikes may so well aske me what assurance I haue that here was a king Henry, as demaund what assurance I haue of the other. And this comfortable point I haue the rather vrged, because some too ignorantly seeke the beginning

of a Church here within these hundred yeeres▪ and the Schismatikes impudently affirme, that they themselues are the first visible Church sprung vp in England. The founder whereof was Browne. Which man, if so he had been stirred vp by God to such a miraculous worke, not onely he should haue been vpheld in that worke (as Moses and Aaron to the old Church, and the Apostles to the new Church: for God neuer forsooke his principall Church-planters) but also, he should haue begun that worke with a better miracle, then by alluring seruants from their masters, children from their parents, wiues from their husbands, Psa. 15.

               Eusebius recordeth that Tiberius Caesar hearing of the excellent things of Iesus, he motioned vnto Romes Senate, that Iesus might be enrolled in the number of their gods. The Senate replied, that now they could not consent to that, because the people alreadie had begun such a blaze, They hauing not first approued the same. Which no doubt (saith Eusebius) was done for this end, that the wholsome doctrine of diuine preaching it should not need the allowance and commendation of men. And surely (were it not that with God euerie thing is possible, as also that the euent makes the thing manifest) how hard a thing should it be to thinke, that the field of the world ouergrowen with Idols and diuels, it should by so weake an instrument as preaching (and that of a Iesus crucified, and that by so meane persons as he sent out) it should (I say) be subdued vniuersally in so small time, vnto the obedience of the Gospell? But this was, that so the word of auncient prophecie it might be fulfilled. So much for the Churches vniuersalitie. It followeth.

               in the midst of the wheat, and went his way. The enemie that soweth those Tares (saith our Sauiour, vers. 39.) is the diuell: and in the verse before, the Tares are the children of the kingdome or Church. As the son of man did not sow his children but by begetting them through the doctrine of truth; so the diuell

doth not create or sow these his children, but by causing them to be such through the doctrine of vntruth. And this his fact of vnhappines is said to be done of him while men slept, that is, while the Church (and specially the Ministers thereof) they were secure and watched not. The Apostle Act. 20.28.29. &c. 
               Paul knowing by faith in this doctrine, that after his departure Wolues would enter into his Church (yea, that of their owne selues some should arise, speaking peruerse things for drawing disciples after them) he tels them the way of preuenting this euill, namely, that they should watch ouer themselues, and ouer the flocke (for God neuer exacteth our seeking his glorie (nor can we) by the neglect of our owne soules: though some would closely teach the contrarie, namely, that they might doe euill to themselues that so good might come thereof, whose damnation is due) for drowsie sleepines (which after came to passe) it would cause confusion enter and arise to the disturbance of all good.
            That it is said, the diuell soweth this tarish doctrine (though he doth it onely by his ministers) we must maruell thereat nothing at all. When the wicked were to cast some of the Smyrnians in prison, the holy Ghost saith, Reuel. 2.10. 
               The diuell shall cast some of you in prison. A King is said to doe that he doth by his Embassadour; nor must the factors of Sathan thinke much to be called Sathan, Math. 16. when as to Peter for an excellent dehortation our Sauiour saith vnto him, Come behind me Sathan: as for Iscariot, he was plainly termed Diuell. But this and some other common places I passe by, and come (for that I specially professe herein) vnto the points in controuersie.
            It is euer accorded vpon, that the Tares are wicked-ones, but what kind of wicked-ones, as also whether within the Church or without, therein is much dissonancie. Libertines say, that they are the whole bodie of wicked people in the Church: and so from our Sauiours speech (Let them grow) they would haue all excommunication ouerthrowen, and all wicked that wil, be admitted vnto the holy supper. Others, that they be heretikes, who are to be permitted of the Magistrate, if so happily they may become wheat by repentance. Others, (whereof hereafter)

they vnderstand them to be such wicked only as are permitted of godly pollicie: that is, not for loue to them, but to the wheat or children of the kingdome. Touching their place, the Browniste affirmes them to be without the Church; because our Sauiour saith, Let them alone: applying the Apostles speech thereto, 1. Cor. 5.1

One great scholler writeth thus: I grant it no shame to the Churches to haue hypocrites, for as much as the iudgement of man cannot discerne them: and of them & no other is the Parable of Tares, which forbiddeth weeding vntill the day of haruest.

            When it is said, that the Tares are in the midst of the wheat (and the wheat is in the Church) it presently conuinceth those that say, they are without. And when as it followeth.
            Vers. 26. And when the blade was sprung vp and brought forth fruit, the Tares APPEARED also. It hereby plainely 
                  •
               nough appeareth, that so verily as the wheat appeared, so verily the Tares appeared. The children of the kingdome appearing such by their fruit, the children of Sathan that way appearing also. Nor appeares this lesse in this, that the Ministers after are grieued at the Sight of them: and for that doe interrogate, if so they may pull them vp? If they had been without, it would not so haue troubled the minds of those that were within: and if they had been hypocrites or inuisible wicked, it could not haue troubled them at all. Those errors are by the Parable it selfe plainely ouerturned. But more plainely (if God permit) it shall appeare by conference of other scriptures. when as I come to examine our Sauiours words, Let both grow together, &c. Meane time obserue, that two sundrie seeds are sowen, & thereof ariseth two sundry sort of people within the Church. The first not onely within the Church, but of it also: and therefore termed children of the kingdome. The other within the

Church, but not of it, and therfore termed children of the wicked. Contrarie seeds, so haue contrarie effectes. The house of Cloë in Corinth, by the fruit shewed thēselues to be true members; others by vnbeleeuing the resurrection did show themselues to be troublous members: or rather a corrupt humour in the bodie that deserued to be purged. And surely, as we would be deemed followers of the sonne of man in a care of planting good, so we must endeuour our selues to sow onely good seed. If we come into pulpit with vnresolued opinions, we must leaue behind vs an vnresolued people, staggring, reeling and caried away with euerie wind of doctrine. But if we sow tarish doctrine in the pulpit, let vs know that the diuell will water it blade and fruit. If we will watch ouer the flocke, we must first watch ouer our selues: yea, take heed to our tongue, least it be set on fire from hell, and so conuert the Churches peace into a flame.
            Who would haue thought that Sadduces (deniers of the resurrectiō) should haue appeared in the Church of Iudah? But the Leuites (some of them) leauing the altar, and betaking them For this doe read the state of Maccabees in Ben-Gorion.
                to Iudahs crowne and scepter, the Lord therefore did punish them with vnbeliefe, who should haue taught others the true beliefe. Who would haue thought that in the Asian Christian Churches such notable heresies could haue risen? who would haue thought that in our Brittaine Churches so many horrours should haue risen? But it is not to be wondred at: first because our Sauiour foresaw and forespake hereof, when as he thus assimilated his kingdome of heauen. Not saying it should be so in the world, but it should be so in the Church. Secondly, as through other Churches, so through ours this sleepie ministery hath passed, wherby an entrance hath been made, & a way paued vnto an Ocean of euils. And that which worse is (of those that would be deemed Reformers) many proue Deformers: and if in zeale they haue once stepped ouer shoes, they count it credit rather for Constancie sake to slosh in ouer boots, then with Augustine to write a booke of Retractations; or with 2.

Constantines I haue met with abroad, and now find no such enemies at home. Let the secret Pharisaicall practices of some witnes that, euen what time I was publikely (to the comfort of distressed soules) exercised in Southwarke vpon this present parable. But the Lord rebuke Sathan. If I being once ouer-caried with their tarish doctrine, doe now go before them in pointing out, and remouing such scandales (& all this without Magistrates constraint, or worlds allurement, witnesse my writings abroad published before in forraine parts) then let them not thinke scorne or take it for a discredit to follow: least euerie faithfull Minister that commeth after, do both by word and writing cast the doung of their solemne assemblies in their faces. If they looke to be saued by holding the foundation, they must not be vnwilling to suffer the losse of their timber, hay, and stubble, when the fire of God in his spirit and word do offer to burne it. By the practise of the law, our own hand should first be vpon the beast, and this done voluntarily: but if men vpon a good meaning will couer those cattell of Agag, yet they shall bleat, crie out and pursue them vnto destruction. It followeth in the text.
            Vers. 27. Then came the seruants of the householder and said vnto him, Master, sowedst thou not good seed 
                     En sô so agrô.
                   in that thy field, from whence then hath it Tares? 28. And be said, the enuious man hath done this.
            
            Two questions are propounded by the seruants vnto the householder, whereof this is the first, together with the answer. For the householder or master of the field, it is plaine before to be the sonne of man. Touching the seruants, some take them to be Magistrates in the Commonwealth: some take them to be Ministers in the Church: I vnderstand it to be spoken of both, and so both will well inough fit, first the Analogie and proportion of faith; secondly, it accordeth aptly vnto the experienced state of Church and Commonwealth, though principally of Ministers.
            
               Then, when? After the field (through Ministers and Magistrates sleepie securitie) was ouergrowen with Tares or

do arise: they ouersee the Catholike Church: they spie not onely offensiue things in the world (whereof no maruell) but also in the kingdome or new Testaments Church. They grieue at the sight, and troubled they are in their soule about the present Confusion. All this notably and comfortably laying downe, that in those last dayes God would not onely stirre vp zealous Ministers for Church reformation, but also excellent Magistrates (as were Zerubbabel, Nehemiah and others) for the reformation of Iudah.
            Nor was this vnseene of Iohn in Patmos,Reuela. 17.12 13 14 15 16 17 18. what time the Angell of God telleth Iohn (in the solitarines of his spirit) that the ten hornes (or ciuill powers) which once had subiected themselues vnto the whorish Citie (Metropolitane then of the earth) what time they lay asleepe by drinking her spirituall fornications, they finally should awake, And hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh and burne her with fire. For God hath put into their hearts to fulfill his will and to do with one consent, for giuing their kingdome vnto the Beast, vntill the words of God be fulfilled. But those wordes of God (for the time of their sleepe) once fulfilled, they arise (as did Henry, Edward and Elizabeth in England) setting fire on the whore for burning vp her abominations. And therefore thrice abominable those spirits, that by word or writing proclaime them Schismatikes (as do the Papists) or Suborners of the beasts kingdome (as doe blind Reformists, Brownists, Anabaptists and Arrians).
            Touching the Ministers, seeing vnto them the more excellent charge of the Church is giuen, by how much more those euils creepe in through their predecessours negligence, by so much the more those their successours are stirred vp in an holy fierie zeale for remouing of present euils. Such a one was He florished Anno. Dom. 1260.
            
            For this purpose let the yong Student read the succession of Doctors, written by Simon de Voyon. William of S. Amour a doctor of Paris. After him Laurence an English man and doctor also there. Then Iohn Wicliffe here in England: and with him, Sautre a Priest. Iohn Hus a Bohemian, first student in Oxford. Ierom of Prage also a Bohemian: with multitudes not onely of Ministers, but also of inferiour callings, whom God stirred vp in all parts for recouerie of a better Ierusalem, then that in Iudea of Beniamin.
            
               But marke that those seruants of Christ, they trust not to their owne iudgements herein: and therefore, they runne vnto Christ to be enformed, by what meanes all this euill is come. Who, as they seeke to him, so from him they receiue a ready and faithfull answere. Who hauing vnderstood by the word of the Lord, that all this was the worke of Satan in his ministers, what time men lay asleepe in securitie (euen as a Garden sowen and planted with good, it bringeth forth readily weedes of all sorts, after a little time of rest) vpon this assurance;
            
               Then the Seruants said vnto him, wilt thou then that wee goe and gather them vp? 29. But he said, No: least while ye goe about to gather the Tares, ye plucke vp the wheat with them also.
            
            The second Interrogatorie and his answere followeth. The question propounded by the same seruants (Magistrates, Ministers, zealous people) the answere is returned by the same Housholder and Master of the Church Christ Iesus. By those holy hearted seruants their second demaund (Wilt thou that we goe and gather them vp?) it plainly appeareth, that they not onely were grieued to see the Church pestred with such tarish companions, but also that they had a zeale burning in them, for rooting them vp: and yet discretion ioyned with zeale, in that they will not walke herein by any conceit of their owne, but onely by the rule of their Master Christ. Griefe at such tares (I doubt not) there is in many: zeale also for tearing vp such tares, I doubt not also there is in many: but a true contentment to passe by their owne conceipt, and to search out their Masters meaning for reformation, it resteth in ouer-few. Hee will walke by this rule, another by that rule for reformation of faith and manners. As for the Brownist, Anabaptist and Arian, they will walke by no rule for reformation of this wheat field, and purging it from weedes: but at one choppe, they hew downe all for Antichristian, and will haue no visible Christian to be found in this confusion of the field. Tut say they, labour we for curing Babel (misapplying Ierem. 51.9. 
               Ieremies speech thereto) we would haue cured her, but could not, therefore my people Go out. And so, when they haue separated from all, condemned all (good and bad, Church and Babel: condemning the substance

of faith and manners in all, because of some disputable accidents, or at most, because of some accidentall euils) they must euery head beginne a new field, a new Church, and all new. And because all are not of one mind, therefore euery one begins a Church (spicke and span new) of a sundry fashion.
            The Brownist keepes the Baptisme he hath in our Church, but denieth the Ministeriall ordination; appointing their lay-people to lay hands on Ministers heads, and so blesse them to their ministeriall office: alleadging the practise of Israels people, laying their hands on the Leuits heads Nomb. 8. Whereas alas, that was but their forme of Approbation, not of Ordination. For when the people (or Elders of the people) had laid on hands, the Leuits thereupon might not administer before the Lord: for their Ordination and blessing resteth to the high Priest: and thereupon came the holy Canon, Hebr. 7.7. 
               Without all contradiction, the lesser is blessed of the greater. For in Nombers 8. it followeth, that Aaron tooke the Leuites, filled their hands with oblation, with his hands did shake them before the Lord: and so (after benediction) did set them to the Altars worke. And this hath Pet. Mar. on 1. Sam. 7. 
               Peter Martyr well obserued and distinguished. And indeed, the ancients made This (not Teaching) to be a cause of distinction betweene Episcop & Presbyter (or Bishop and Priest: for these words are of the former Greeke corrupted) namely, That the Bishop might ordaine, the Elder not) for so Chrysostome (hauing said that So do all Ancients.

                  ene a Bishop and Elder there is almost no difference. For by Ordination alone, they are their superiours: and this (power) onely they are thought more to haue, then haue the Presbyters, or Elders or Priests. Therefore (passing by Priestes, as all of them figures of Christ) they casting eye vnto Church-order, they ordinarily cause resemblance alike to be had betweene Bishop & Presbyter, as was of old time betweene the high Priest and the ordinarie Priests: and the resemblance of common Presbyter and Deacon, to lie in such difference as was betweene the ordinarie Priest and common Leuits. And indeede, the trueth is such: though such as despise ancient record and reading do (as

some doe at home) make sacred Ordination a friuolous ceremonie. Whereby the Brownists of common inferiour lotte, they haue learned to bid their father (hee that begot them to that faction) to kneele downe, and they t

            Touching the Anabaptists, they stand not partaking in the matter (as doth the Brownist) but they exusflate or blow off our Baptisme, so well as Ordination, saying: All that floweth from Antichrists ministers, it must be Antichristian. And so, one baptizeth I knew one such, and sundry can witnes it. himselfe (as Abraham first circumcis

Lucifer. as he left such practise free vnto others their iudgement, imposing no law on any (as appeareth in his epistles to Iubaian and Stephen Romes Bishop) so the same opinion after was retracted by the Bishops. And in a detestation of such rebaptization it was which caused Chrysost. on hebr. 6. 
               Chrysostome thus to write: Qui secundo &c. He that the second

            Touching our English Arrians, they deny all Baptisme and Ordination, till new Apostles be sent to execute those parts to the Gentiles, and Elias the Thisbite do come for that end vnto the Iewes. Thus (not to speake of other their doctrines) euery sectarie and schismatike hath his sundry Church and fashion of constitution: all of them (in trueth) notable schismatikes from the Common-wealth of Israel: as Moab, Ammon, Edom, and others made brea

               h from the orderly seede of Abraham. But let them goe, the seruants of Christs fielde, they consult with

their Master, and from him they receiue this answere: Do not teare vp the tares, let both grow togither vntill the last haruest &c. so farre is he from bidding them to go out, or yet pull them vp.
            Two notable questions do arise from hence: first, Whether perm
                     •
                  ssion of open wicked in the Churches fellowship (for such be those tares) it do not ouerthrow the Rule of excommunication taught in Matth. 18.17. & 1. Cor. 5. Or if it do not, how then those places can be reconciled? Secondly, How the permission of these shal not pollute, seeing some open wicked do pollute in 1. Cor. 5.6. and Galat. 5.9. Touching the first, I answere: Permit vnto Doomesday, and Excommunicate before Doomesday, they are as easily reconciled, as Dauids worde and practise is found good. When for his word it is written, Psal. 101. 
               That he would not suffer a wicked man in his family: and yet for his practise, 1. King. 2. 
               he suffered Ioab in his family, leauing the slaughtering of him to Salomon his sonne succeeding. And in a word it is thus: Those that can be excommunicate without harming the wheat (that is, without rending Churches peace and vnitie) those are to be excommunicate: but such are to be permitted (not for loue to them, but to the Lords wheat) as the excommunicating of whom would rend the Church in peeces. The contrary practise is, to be peniwise, pound-foolish. Nor is this resolution new, but ancient: for Augustine to the Aug. cont. Parm. l. 3. whom Iohannes Wolphius followeth in his answere to certaine questions touching the Church. Donatist hereof writeth thus: Ipse Dominus &c. To the seruants willing to gather the tares, the Lord hi
                     •
                  
                  selfe saith: Suffer yee both to grow vntill the haruest: The cause hee premiseth saying: Least peraduenture while ye would collect the tares, together with the same ye pull vp the wheat. Wherein he sufficiently sheweth, when such cause of feare is not (but a certaine safetie altogither of the graine with certaine stabilitie, abideth: that is, when as euery such one his crime is knowne to all, and to all appeaereth execrable, insomuch as it hath no one, or not such defenders through whom a Schisme may fall out) then (Non dormiat seueritas disciplinae) Let not disciplines seueritie sleepe. Then this may well be done without spot of peace and vnitie; as also, without detriment to the wheate, &c. Wherein he concludeth, a practise of disciplines seueritie, when Churches peace and vnitie may be preserued, but otherwise

not. Nor is this permission a stranger in scripture, no more then the practise of excommunication. For as in 1. Cor. 5. the Apostle Paul vrgeth a putting out: so the Apostle Iohn 
               
                  
                     •
                  . Iohn 9. 
               Diotrephes the affector of preeminence, a pratler, a busie bodie, and one that would neither himselfe harbour such as came from the Apostle, nor yet suffer others. The Apostle promiseth (if hee come) to lay him out in his colours, intending thereby no doubt to prepare a way for his casting out: but meane time hee permits him, inasmuch as he bids them not deliuer him to Satan. Such tares were the factious teachers in Galatia Churches (ioyning Circumcision and Baptisme together &c.) whom the Apostle in those wordes (Would to God they were cut off) doth secretly permit, in that he dare not (as in another 1. Cor. 5. case) giue it in command. And when to the Corinthes he writes, I feare when I come againe, my God abase me among you, and I shall bewaile many: of them which haue sinned ALREADIE, & haue not repented of their vncleannes and fornication & wanto
                     •
                  nes which they haue committed: here the Apostle not wishing the Corinthes to deliuer such to Satan (as in 1. Cor. 5. he willeth the incestuous to be giuen vp, for whose behoofe no one with face could stand) but plainly seeing (yet after a sort halfe winking at) those notable euils, he giueth notice (as Augustine also hence vrgeth) that it was because of their tarish clasping condition. And for no loue to the tares, but for loue of Church and Common-wealthes peace it was, that Dauid permitted Shimei of Beniamins quarrelling tribe fauourite to Saul: as also suffered bloody Ioab to liue all his dayes, for that otherwise he might haue brought all the souldiers on his necke, for auenging the death of their worthy Generall.
            Now (if a Tares condition be considered) can any other conclusion be vrged? for it is not, as many weeds who may be seuered without daunger: but as it growes vnder the leaues of wheat vnseene, like an hypocrite at first, so it

               ation of life. And for this cause (namely for preseruation of life, and auoiding some great euil ensuing) we oftentimes permit that we like not. Nor is he fit to gouerne a family (much lesse a Church) that walketh not by this rule & consideration. If any now demand what if Diotrephes repent, or for want of repentance he be by Iohn in after time cast out, is such a one yet a Tare? Two answers are hereto framed. The first is, yea: as Simon was surnamed Leper (because once a Leper) so may such a one be called a Tare, because once a Tare. The second answer I giue thus: if either of the former things fal out, he may be said to haue stood (for the former clasping season) as a tare, but now he bewraies himself not to, be such: Euē as, the 1. Cor. 5. incestuous person was deliuered vp to Satan for leauen & a seruant to Satan, who 2. Cor. 2. after proued a man of true spirit & holines. The Parable (as other Parables) it must not be stretched beyond the purpose of our Sauiour made manifest by other consent of scripture: and so I haue proued Augustines collection to be found & irrefragable. If any reply, only those open wicked ones are Tares as die Tares (because it is after said, they shall by the Angels in the great haruest be gathered vp) 
                  •
               so could add, because Tares are bid to grow vntil the last haruest, therfore none are Tares that liue not vntill the last haruest. As also, by that reason we should neuer know who are Tares vntill death: and so to no purpose commaunded to let them grow togither, seeing after death they can no more grow togither. To auoid such foolish consequents, the proprietie of a Parable must therfore ay be heeded.
            The former conclusion remembred, downe fals the Libertines collection, who would haue all publike wicked permitted: seeing here is not speech of all euill ones, but of a kind of euill-ones which cannot with kingdomes children their good be pulled vp, or cut off, by Magistrate or Minister. Euen as in the Parable of the Math. 25. fiue foolish virgins, he declareth not open wicked, but hypocrites (seeing they had their lamps and lights and went to meet the bridgroome so well as the other fiue. Nor was their foolishnes discouered to the Church, vntill they

had slep the sleep of all flesh (good and bad) and were raised againe by the shout of the Archangell) so euerie Parable hath his owne propriety. Here also falleth to ground all such as haue with Chrysostome and Erasmus vnderstood them to be heretikes, whom the Magistrates should permit to growe, vntill happily they might become wheat. Yet Chrysostome addeth: Chrysost. hom. 47. on. Math. 
               Non prohibet, &c. Our Sauiour forbiddeth not to dissipate the conuenticles of heretikes, the stopping of their mouthes, to cut off all libertie of speaking: onely he forbids the killing of them. But as he hath no warrant hence of preseruing heretikes liues, so he hath warrant inough from many places, for scattering the assemblies, stopping their mouthes, &c. And surely, the Magistrate can neuer be thought to be zealous for the Lord, when he beares (as the ordinarie States of Germanie doe) a sword for their ciuill matters, but none for the Lords religion. To ground also here falleth the Anabaptistes doctrine of Christians vnlawfulnesse for bearing and exercising the sword against trangressors: seeing (say they foolishly from hence) they may liue to become true Christians. In a word, diuers fantasies here fall downe (as Dagon before the Arke) nor meruell, seeing tymber, hay and stubble is in the Lords day appointed to burne; that so, gold, siluer, and precious stone it may be discouered for only sutable to the foundation of this heauens kingdome.
            Now to the second question, How the permission of such Tares (or tarish persons) they shall not pollute the fellowship? That such permission is not sinne or pollution to the permitters, it appeareth if but in this, that Christ not onely aduiseth, but also commaundeth such permission for the peace & good of his wheat, or true sonnes of the Church. If first such open wicked vpon due sight and search be found (not thistles, da

               ke or such separable weeds: for it is presumed that such the seruants here had and would pull vp, but) Tares, or to vs ward in a tarish estate: and if in the second place we permit those Bastards for the childrens sake onely, then such permission is no pollution to vs that haue so seene, sought and permitted. First, because our Sauiour enioineth such sufferance, and who dare make him a counsailour to euill, a maintainer of sinne? Secondly, if the

                     .) so vnderstands it: accounting the opinion of perfection to the Manechists: and ordinarily all our late writers so take it. Apostle touching sinne in his owne flesh resisting his will (or law of the mind) hauing will present with him, but wanting meanes to performe that is good: if notwithstanding this vnrulines of the flesh, he proclaimes himselfe deliuered from this sinne (or bodie of death) by Christ ruling in him by his spirit, &c. If I say, sinne dwelling in him, he is not therfore seruant to sinne but to Christ, because a better spirit or lawe ruleth in him: much lesse can another mans sinne pollute me or my new man created in Christ, who is so farre from being led captiue by his sinne, as I hate it; and as meanes by God are giuen vnto me in my place, do labour the slaughter of his sinne and expulsion thereof: and when such meanes of remouing him is lacking to me, yet the good-will of remouing such a scandale is neuer lacking. Keeping thus my heart and conscience cleane, all things that are without, are to me cleane & pure. But if the conscience be priuie to a liking of the scandale, and negligent in vsing the fit meanes God hath granted for remouing such a scandale, then he is pollution vnto me, and my soule is attainted with his sinne. The one and the other of those conclusions, haue their ground also from that to Titus 1.15. and in Marke 7.18.19.20, 21.22.23. But it will be obiected, in those two scriptures speech is onely of indifferent things: I answere, the doctrine is generall, and therefore appliable not onely to those indifferencies there mentioned: for nothing (whatsoeuer) is without can be pollution to vs, prouided there arise not in our heart a liking or consent to such euill, nor yet of vs be permitted, when apt meanes are granted for remoual, at least for bridling such euill. Touching this point, it is thus written in Origen on Exod. 20. & 
                     •
                  . comm. 
               Origen (whether by him or another I contend not) Illud tacendum non est, &c. That neither is to be concealed, (namely) that the knowen wicked hurt the Church, if so be that, either power of prohibiting them the Communion be lacking, or some reason of conseruing peace do hinder. It is plain that this is not hurtful to a man (namely) That there is some wicked man (yea, a knowne wicked) present with thee at Christ his Altar: though he be not prohibited, prouided by a good conscience discontented with him, he be separated from him. Manifest therefore it is, that to run with a thiefe, it is no other thing then

eyther to steale with him, or with a pleasing heart to accept of his stealth. And that the Church hath euer been so minded, consider not onely her recordes for iudgement, but also for her continuall practise. Whatsoeuer therefore in any of my writings may seeme to conclude oppositiuely, I desire it may be reduced hither, where so fully and plainely I haue discussed the q

Nor let any distinguish here (against the streame of the whole Church) between common communion, and the communion in the Lord his supper: for, besides the Ancients their meaning is plaine, we are to consider; first, that the Church is commaunded by suppers administration to set forth Chri

But if they cannot with peace and Churches vnion be restrained, they must be rather suffered to Grow in their euil, then (by hindering the Lords raine and sacramentall showers) the wheat should be hindered in their grouth. Let them grow togither (saith our Sauiour) vntill the haruest: though to the one sort, word, sacraments, fellowship shall be a sauour of life vnto life, but to the other a sauor of death vnto death: euen a sit was vnto such as brought oblations vnto the tabernacle, wherof some by the faithfull Priest were freely admitted: others against his wil (as Ioab & Shimei) but admitted, because otherwise by the sword they could not be peaceably cut off. So much for this point: it followeth.
            Vers. 30. Let both grow togither vntill the haruest, and in the time

of haruest I will say to the Reapers, gather ye first Tares, and binde them in sheaues to burne them, but gather the wheat into my barne.
            
            As our Sauiour will haue the tares to grow togither with his children in the Church (& this vntill the great haruest of God: that is, as is expounded vers. 40. vntill the end (namely of all things) what time he will send forth his Angels for gathering all those offensiue ones forth of the kingdome, vers. 41.) As I say, our Sauiour willeth so long sufferance of the tares, so hence we are to obserue the forme of speech (Let them grow togither vntill the haruest) whence some conclude euery tare his particular haruest at the time of his death, as also a generall haruest of all in the end of the world. Touching such particular haruest here is no speech (although it be true from other scripture, that the tree falling into the cold nipping Eccles. 11.3. North it shall there lie) the speech here is onely of the great vniuersall haruest, wherein finall doome is giuen to all. If any say, but all the tares which haue been some 100. yeares since are dead, &c. I answer, our Sauiour promiseth to his Apostles, that in executing their commission, he would be with them vnto the end of the world, and lo they died and ceased preaching and baptizing 1500. yeares since. The Apostle charged Timothie to keepe the commaundement vnspotted till the appearance of Christ Iesus, and Timothie fell on sleepe about 1500. yeares since also. As in the Apostles and Timothie, the whole bodie of ministery succeeding in that worke, it is vnderstood, so in the tares first considered amidst the wheat, there is vnderstood the whole corporation of such wicked in succession vnto the worlds end. A bodie of sinne or corporation of wicked, Christ Iesus speaketh vnto, when he thus saith to the Pharisees: Fulfill the measure of your sins, &c. that vpon you may come all the righteous blood of Abel the righteous,Math.

If I say, the open wicked could be cald departed from (as that rebellious

For separation in such case, it is (as Cyprian. l. 3. epist. 4. 
               Cyprian wel saith) first a vendicating of that authoritie to our selues, which the Father hath giuen to his Sonne alone: and secondly, it is but a proud obstinacie and sacrilegious presumption (quam sibi furor prauus assumit) which a wicked frenzie assumeth to it selfe. Which speech of Cyprian, old Augustine borroweth and oft applieth against Donatus.

               And if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant) that so fulfilling and vpheaping the measure of sinne, they may afterwardes haue the more notable fall, & breake-necke downe-fall. Were it not for this haruest, as the faithfull of all others were most miserable, so those grapling tares triumphing ouer the Lordes people, they were of all men most blessed. But, yea I say againe But there is a day comming, a blacke day, a gloomie day, a day of terrour and horrour to all the children of Belial.
            
            A haruest must haue reapers, & the reapers here be Angels. The greatnesse of the Reapers, it argues the greatnesse of the haruest. Nor maruell that both Haruest and Reapers be great, when as the great GOD is the sender forth of those Angels, and people are the matter that must be reaped. This Haruest is represented vnto Reuel. 15.18. &c. 
               Iohn in Patmos, vnder the reaping of Grapes with a sharpe sickle; and there by the ministerie of an Angell commanded so to by another Angell which had authoritie ouer fire. As it is very true, that Christ hath all absolute power giuen him ouer fire, water and euery creature, so I well like the iudgement of such as teach that the elements are committed by the Lord vnto the Angels, for vsing the same against the wicked, and in the behoofe of his children. Touching whose ministration Peter Martyr hath this: Pet. Mart. on 1. King. 5. 
               Redeo ita

                   ad ipsos Angelos &c. I returne vnto the Angels themselues, by whose ministerie also I affirme, that God gouerneth physicall or naturall things. For by their meanes vndoubtedly the celestiall Spheres or heauens. Orbes are turned about: and admirable thinges be produced in Nature. For which cause it is elegantly written, That God himselfe is carried by the Cherubims. Here saith our Sauiour, the Sonne of man shal send forth his Angels, how doth this agree with that of Paul, 
               1. Thess. 4.16. 
               The Lord himselfe shall descend from heauen with a showte, with the voyce of the Archangell, and with the trumpet of God? By which showte our Sauiour afterwards in the Gospell saith, Matth 25. all the wise and foolish Virgins shal awake and be gathered to iudgement. Touching the sending forth of Angels (or as Iohn hath in his Reuelation, an Angell) as also touching those tearmes, a Showte, the voyce of a Trumpe, I take them to bee borrowed phrases adapted to haruest and sleepe. For a haruest, there must be Gatherers: for

raising people out of sleepe, there must be some showte or loud voyce: euen so, for gathering this spirituall haruest, and for awaking the spirituall sleepers in the earths bowels, there must be a Gathering and a Noise: but touching the forme of all this in proprietie, I take it, we now are vncapable. Yet (as in another place) Lazarus his soule is by Angels ministerie conuayed into Abrahams bosome: and well inough also may be iudged on the other side, that the Gluttons soule was conuayed into hell (according to that speech vnto another Miser, Thou foole, this night They shall take away thy soule) so it may well be, that by the ministerie of Angels, the soules vnited to their bodies for ful doome, they shall be presented vnto iudgement. But yet this ministerie a power in mediatly deriued from the Archangell (Iombard l. 4. dist. 43. B.Christ Iesus) according to that in Iohns Gospel chap. 5.28. The houre shall come, in the which all that are in the graues shall heare his voyce, that is (as before) the voyce of the Sonne of man: that is, of Christ Iesus in our nature appearing.
            
               Cerinthus. Now must Cerinthus (if before death he repented not) now must he come forth and make his answere, for teaching that Iesus was not borne of Marie, otherwise then by knowing Ioseph her husband carnally. That he was not Christ; but that Christ came vpon him in the forme of a Doue. And that Iesus suffered, but Christ fled away &c. Against whose abominable opinion touching Iesus his onely being man, Iohn is said to haue written his Euangell: which indeed affordeth arguments, specially for proofe of his Diuinitie.
            Now must the Nicolaitans Carpocratians. Nicolaitans that died such, come forth & answere for their communitie of women. As also the Carpocratians for denying saluation to the flesh: with others their followers, holding it of the diuell: giuing it vp to all filthinesse, as it were therby to be auēged on the body, their soules prison.

And for this cause worshipped the serpent for Christ &c. vpon which the Church gaue them that name Ophitai or Serpentinists.) Now must they come forth and know to their shame, that they worshipped the diuel of hell in stead of Christ.
            
               The Montanists Montanists, who held Montanus for the holy Ghost, condemned mariage for filthinesse &c. now those blasphemous filthy tongues must come out and bee tormented with Diues tongue in hell fire.

Arians (who taught that there was a time wherein God was not a Father, nor the Sonne a Sonne: that the Sonne was not of one substance with the Father, but of another nature; a creature and meere man: tearmed God onely in regard of office, as Magistrates be, &c. Now must they stand forth before that God who will to them indeed proue no Father, but a consuming fire.

               Eutychians.Now the sect of Eutyches (who held that Christ assumed no nature of ours: the Anabaptists doctrine in these dayes) they shall in this day learne, that that body and soule shall be damned, the first fruites whereof were not first assumed by Christ Iesus.
            The Monothelite.Mono-thelites (so tearmed for teaching that Christ Iesus had onely one will) they in this day shall be taught to their shame, that Christ had two wils vnconfounded: the one peculiar vnto his Godhead, which was (as the nature was) Infinite:
               
the other peculiar to his manhood, and (as it was) finit. The first Will strong as God, the second infirme as man, but infirmity without sinne. In a word, all the wicked (tares or other weeds) they must now be seuered from the Lord his wheat: and that which more is, they must be collected and bound vp in sheaues. Not in one sheaue but sundrie, according to the measure of their euils. One faction in one sheafe, another faction in another sheafe: but all prepared for one hell, for one fire, euerlastingly burning.
            Yet (though but one hell, one fire of wrath) scripture seemeth to imply (by vniuersall consent of the Church) that the measure of torment shal be Reue. 18.6. diuersly proportioned, according to the proportion and qualitie of sinne in the subiect. Nor dislike I a certaine Ancient his iudgement touching this, namely, that as in creatures all apt to burne, yet some feede the fire more then the other (as for example: oylie and gummie timber, more then fewell of a diuers nature) euen so, of sinners damned, all capable to burne: but the same fire and torment more enlarged by the subiect it worketh vpon, as his sinne shall be more large and notable. Sin (be it more or lesse) is so considered as the subiect whereon the burning wrath of God shal haue matter to feed vpon for euer. And this is the way, whereby the iustice of God against sinne, it shall be declared a Iustice for euer. In this day, the Originists (who haue taught that diuell and all shall once come out of that fire and be saued) they shall find that sinne in the damned neuer dies (nay, I rather thinke that it is encreased: if so sinne can be enlarged in hell: seeing sinne vnmortified, is budding & bringing forth more euil in thought word, worke) and so consequently, the Isa. 66.24. Reuel. 14.11. gnawing worme neuer to die, that fire neuer to be put out.
            And as the tares (the most politicall wicked) together with the whole corporation of Satan, they thus shal find in the end, their glorie turned into shame, & their temporarie heauen into an eternall hell. So the Lord his wheat or children of the kingdome (for though the other were in it, yet they were not of it) they are in this great day gathered into the Lords barne. Though they grew together here, they must be seuered there. The wicked shall not stand in the assembly of the

righteous: nor after that day, shall the soule of any righteous Lot, be combred and galled with Sodome. The Iebusits gall vs heere, but they drinke gall and wormewood for it there. We contentedly suffer here, but it is appointed that we shall be glorified there. Into the Lords barne, Abrahams bosome, Paradise, heauens glory we shall all be receiued: and there for eternitie placed.
            But as there is more or lesse measure of torment for the wicked; so, shall there not be a diuersitie of glorification in Christ Iesus his members? The vniuersall streame of antiquity concluding affirmatiuely, I dare not ioyne with them that conclude negatiuely. Besides, the scriptures they vrge to this purpose, I cannot see them otherwise applied then aptly and fitly. For our Sauiours words in Iohn, 
               Iohn. 14.2.3. 
               In my fathers house are many dwelling Mansions (if it were not so I would haue told ye) I go to prepare a place for you. Where they reply that these seuerall mansions are to be vnderstood here in the Church: I answer, that cannot be: for the sundrie mansions must be considered in the place whither Iesus was repairing (namely, in heauens glory) and not in the earth whence he was departing. Which better appeareth in that after he preoccupates this questiō of the Apostles (What shall become of vs meane time?) whereto he answereth their thought, saying: Though I go to prepare a place for you, I will come againe. And where the auncients do alleadge that of Paul: There is another glorie of the Sunne, and another glory of the Moone, and another glory of the Stars, (for one Starre differs from another in glory) 
               This clause in proprietie is the end of the verse. 
               So also in the resurrection of the dead. If any here reply, that this is to be vnderstood of the first resurrection (which is here) from sinne, he speakes openly against the generall and scope of the Chapter: which was to teach the resurrection of our bodies (not soules) against some that in the Church denied it. Againe, if they say that the comparison is between earthly and heauenly bodies, in this place it is apparantly false: for here he concludes: Looke what difference in the glorie of Starres, (though all glorious) euen such difference in the resurrection of bodies, though all glorious: for before the resurrection, no bodie is glorious. And surely, were it we considered but the state of a bodie (where we see all the members excellent, yet a difference

of excellency: and yet the difference no cause of emulation in the bodie, because ech member hath that which is fitting his own place) as also, if we consider that all the beauteous order of God it lieth in distinctions, it must help to perswade, that in his mysticall bodie there be an Identitie (or One-nes) touching the generall, Eternall life: yet there must be distinction or difference touching the measure of glorification.

The Apostle hauing taught the Corinths so plainly of a difference (not between corruptible and incorruptible bodies, but) between glorie and glorie of bodies risen; it shall be preposterous after so plain assertion, to conclude the contrary from a darke phrase.

And surely, as the contrarie perswasion doth effect in men a remisnes and slouthfulnes in the Lords worke; so, the beliefe of this doctrine is (as a goad) in our sides for stirring vs forward in the works of the vineyard: for out of the vineyard or Churches fellowship, no promise of peny or eternall life.

With whose appearance, as our glory shall begin, so neuer shall it end (though wicked Chiliasts haue pronounced it to be but of a thousand yeares durance) but as verily as we are by the holy Ghost ioyned to the Sonne, and the Sonne to the Father: so verily we cannot be any more pulled from the possessed glory, then the spirit can be rent from the Sonne, and the Sonne from the Father, and the father from himselfe.
