            ¶To his specyall good
frynde Maister Griffine
Tyndale, Iohan Bale wisheth
longe and prosperous
welfare in
Christe.
            
               AT the instaūt request
(dere frynde Maister
Tindale) of an olde &
familiar acquaintaūce
of myne, Iohan Uogler
an Almayne borne,
I translated this litle
wurke oute of Latine
into Englishe, and from poesye to prose
aboue iii. years ago. And now it came
in my mynde, not only to make it commen
vnto you, but a so to dedicate it, &
so publysh it fourth in your name The
author therof, called Baptista Mantuanus,
was an excellent Poete in the prouynce
of Lumbardye, brought vp in the
noble cyt
                  •
               e of Mantua, where as Uyrgyle
the famouse Poete was borne also.
And though he wer a supersticious fryre
of the secte of reformed Carmelytes, as
they there called them, yet was he a man
of most excellent learnynge in Latine,
Greke▪ and Hebrue, & smelled out more
abuses in the Romysh churche, then in
those daies he durst wele vtter, Notwithstāding

he spared not in his earnest writtynges,
at times, both breuely and sharply
to towche them.
            In hys fift Egloge, in declarynge the
nature of Auarice, he bryngeth in Rome
for example Rome (sayth he) rendereth
nothynge els, but very tryfles. And for
them agayne she receyueth good golde.
Uayne promyses shall ye haue there, and
nothynge els▪ For alas, all that she seketh
is moneye. Couetousnesse at thys
daye rewleth all there, and vertu is vtterly
bānyshed. And in the .ix. Egloge he declareth
at large, that all kyndes of vyces
are at Rome muche made of, and be had
in great honour. Also in Libro .ii. Syluarum,
he saith: Mars is father to the Romanes,
and Lupa their nource, for in lecherie
and murther spende they all their
lyues and studie. If ye mynde to lyue
wele (sayth he) come not at Rome. For
though ye maye at Rome do all other
thynges, yet ye may not there lyue wel,
or leade an honest lyfe.
            In hys first boke de Sacris diebus, as
he dare, he holdeth with the maryage of
Byshoppes, and sayth: That in the prymatyue
churche their lyues were muche
better, and more holye hauynge wyues,
then now hauyng none. And that it was
a more sure waie a great deale, and more

agreable wyth gods lawe, then thys other,
consyderynge that God neuer abhorred
marryage, but sanctified it. The
vnmarried state is ieopardous (he saith)
and suche a bytter yoke when it is professed,
as Christ wold neuercharge any
man with. Yea so cruell a burden, as yet
to thys daye bryngeth fourth many vnnaturall
monsters (abhomynacyons he
wolde saye) and by an horrible presumpcyon
was first inuented. In the xii▪ boke
of the same wurke he reprehendeth the
Schole doctours, for sophistically contendynge
about tryhles, and vanitees,
as was the questyon of our Ladies concepcion
amonge the orders of fryers:
and the argument of leuended or vnleuended
breade in the sacrament, agaynst
ye Grekes. Many great strifes hath bene
(he sayth) and brawlyng battailes, wise
men sumtyme lawghynge both the parties
to scorne, as they haue in high seats
dysputed the matters. For both labours
hath bene vayne, presumptuouse, rashe,
and folyshe, theyr reasons weake and
theyr matter vnauaylable, more for ostetacyon
then any good learnynge.
            In hys seconde boke of the lyfe of Nicolas
Tolentyne, in speakynge of Bishoppes
and priestes, he sheweth of what
ambycyon, tyrannye, pryde, and deadly

hate they were in hys tyme. They spent
all theyr dayes (sayth he) in banketynge
and lecherie, yea Rome that is boasted
so holye, becommynge a most execrable
brothell house▪ The popes most holie palace
(whych is. S. Peters owne chamber)
is now so pestered with whores, that
it stynketh to hell gates. Ye the sauour
therof so molesteth heauē, yt it is now become
to all the whole worlde abhomynable.
The great byshops, Ordynaries,
Abbottes, Deanes, Prouostes, and suche
other, whych dailye offer vp the vnsau
                  •
               
               ry
sacryfyces (or synge masses whether
ye wyll) & eate theyr vnleuened cakes
or whyte waffers, care neyther for Christ
nor hys doctryne. They thynke there is
no manner of lyfe after thys, for they
neyther double hell nor dampnacyon.
In dyuers of hys bokes, he hath many
lyke sentences, whych noteth hym not
altogether to be a Papyst, though he
were in the tyme of most depe papistrye,
and a Fryre.
            By this we maye wele perceyue, that
in all ages and in all congregacyons,
some godly men there were, whych hauynge
the ryghte sprete of the chyldren
of God, smelled out that fylthie Iakes
of the Deuyll, that malygnaunt synagoge
of Rome, what though they dyd

               
                  〈◊〉
                by the vnpurenesse of the tyme in
manye other thynges. The worlde was
yet neuer so sore oppressed with the depe
slepe of darkenesse and ignoraunce, but
some lyuely spretes were alwayes vygilaunt,
to wake the multytude. For he
that kepeth Israel, doth neyther slūber
nor slepe. Psal. C.xx. And as concerning
thys present treatyse, that deathe is not
to be feared, whych Baptista first wrote
to a frynde of hys, a peere or senatour of
Bononye, called Iason Castelius, he
sheweth hym self no lesse dyuynely then
naturally, no lesse christenly, then poetycally
to handle that matter. But this I
leaue to the dyligent reader, because the
sayd treatyse doth follow here in course.
            In confirmacyon of that Christē rule
whych he hath therin very plenteouslye
persuaded, the scriptures of God hath
muche to vtter, if they were throughly
searched. If God hath enacted it, that
all men, ones shall dye. Hebre ix. who cā
withstand it? Who can auoyde it? If all
men haue one enteraunce vnto lyfe, and
one goynge out in lyke maner agayne.
Sap. vii What man wyll alwayes lyue,
& neuer se death? Psal. lxxxviii. If prosperyte
and aduersyte, lyfe and deathe,

He yt heareth my wurdes (saith Christe)
and beleueth on hym that sent me, hath
euerlastynge lyfe, and shall not come in

            ¶A lamentable cōplaynt

Paraphrastycallye translated

English tūge

Bale.
            
               O Folyshe mynde or
waueryng conscience,
whi art thu sorowfull?
why desparatlye fearest
thu Deathe, as one of thy
selfe forgetful? O blynde sowle,
and vndiscrete hart, why dost thu
so muche regarde thys wretched
weake bodi? Whiles thu sore trē
               blest,
that fearefulnesse of thyne
tormenteth my bowels. The terrour
thereof slydeth downe from
my hart, & accombreth my whole
body. My sycke face in waxinge
pale, confesseth thy grefe, and the
colde caulme thereof ouerwhelmeth

my feble stomacke. Set a
part such heauinesse, considering
that deathes power extendeth
not ouer all. The more parte of
thinges created, feareth nothing
the dartes of Deathe. For God
hath graciously gyuen the chefe
Empyre to lyfe, to deathe hath
he in comparyson graunted but
a very small power. The water
and the earthe are subiect to corrupcyon,
so are the ayre and fyre
with all those thynges whō they
bringe fourth, or yt are made of
their mixtures. For so much as ye
hygh heauen, and the fixed stars
therin, were created of a far other
matter, thei neuer chāge their coū
               tenaūces,
but remayne alwayes
incorruptible. And although the
creator of all thynges, beynge
an omnipotēt God, might at his
pleasure, reduce them agayne in

to theyr olde Chaos, or confuse
matter wythout shape. Yet wyll
not hys deuine goodnesse so do,
but of most louyng fauer he permitteth
those his creatures, both
to liue and remaine. Yea, he suffereth
them not only to continue,
but also to mynystre theyr vertues
and properties, eche one in
hys kynde, and gyueth them his
dayly strength in perfourmaūce
of the same. The thynges which
he made durable, persyst styll in
theyr strength, and can by no violence
be destroied, but must for
euer endure. The thinges which
he constituted corruptible & mortall,
must be consumed of tyme, &
so haue theyr endes by corrupcion.
All that is aboue the regyon
of the Elementes, he hathe appointed
to remaine for euer. Under

ye Mone hath he placed such
workes as naturallye muste perysh.
The florishinge borders of
lyfe, are therefore moste large,
Deathe beinge an enemye, holdeth
empire vnder the starres, in
places much more narrowe. Yet
are not all thynges vnder the
Mone, subiect to corrupciō. Life
wythdraweth sumwhat frō Deathes
iurisdiccion. For though the
bodies of men be mortal by commixtion
of Elementes, yet haue
theyr sowles a substaunce of dyuyne
simplicite, wherby they are
immortal. Symplicite withoute
mixture dyschargeth deathe, for
so much as it can not of it selfe be
deuided, neyther can it dysseuer
one part from an other. The simple
is not compact of the .iiii. Elementes,
but that noble worke

God created of nothing. O foolyshe
mynde, why art thou than
heauy? yea, why fearest yu death?
as one of thy self forgetfull? why
dost thu so vndiscretely loue that
carrian carcas of thyne? That
feble bodye thou fauourest, by
whose accombraunce thou art
not only vexed, but also both oppressed,
weltered, and made vyle
in his filthynesse. So that thou
hast no power to loke towardes
heauen whych is thy natural mā
               siō
but thou art inforced to neglect
yt eternall benefyght. Thou
hast pleasure in that wretched body,
whose felyshyp violētly draweth
the into all shame, filthynes,
& synne. By a thousand naughty
affectes, or yll mocyons▪ art thou
led, to thy notable infamy, not vnlyke
the oxe that is vnder a most

heauy yoke. Under thys greate
wayght thu lyest, as dyd the Giaunte
Enceladus, whose members
the Poetes report to be buried
vnder the mighty hyl of Aethna.
The wanton pleasures or
entisementes of the body, are thy
cruell enemyes, yet wylt thu not
so take them, for theyr propertie
is to ouerthrow the vnbewares.
By them fell Adam our fyrst parent,
from Paradise his first mā
               sion,
and became a miserable exyle,
by tastynge the forbydden
frute. Looke wele vpon it, what
careful sorowes, and what paine
full dyseases that vyle and wretched
fleshe bryngeth wyth hym?
Beholde how lyghtlye it is corrupted,
and whan it hathe neede
of necessary foode, how extremelye
euer more it calleth vppon

the for help: Alwaies is it weake
vntowarde, negligent, and hath
deathe at hande. Euermore bryngeth
it pensyuenesse, euermore
anguysh and trouble. O folysh
hart whye sorowest yu? Why fearest
thu deathe so moche, as one
of thy self forgetfull: yea, why delyghtest
thu so moch in that mortall
bodye of thyne? God hathe
made the, ye lady gouernour therof,
and thu art redy to become a
slaue to these stynkynge mēbers
and carryage of rott. Awake out
of thys slomber, and shake away
frō the, these vnprofitable cares.
Leyserly gather thy wyttes togyther,
and loke to thy naturall offyce,
as one of power or in autorite.
Leaue these earthely studyes
and consider who ruleth the heauens,
who reuolueth the clere shinynge

starres? Tell me hardely,
what powers they are that moueth
so myghty substaūces: How
cōmeth it to passe, that the spring
tyme the haruest, the cold winter,
and the hotte drye sommer, returneth
to vs yearly: what is he that
causeth these contynuall courses
by ye worldes reuolucion: Bodies
are subiect to spretes, & lyfe quickneth
them. A lyuely mynde is it,
that ruleth and reuolueth the heauens.
A most worthy mynde is it
(yea, God hym selfe) whych holdeth
resydence in the clere toppe
of the worlde, or the heauen imperyall.
Thys mynde not only conserueth,
but also disposeth, & quickneth
forewarde hys owne large
wurke. Thys eternall mynde is
it, that created all thynges in .vi.
dayes. Alone amonge all other,

haue thys minde rested euer sēce.
Thys worthy mynde, vseth all other
myndes as hys mynysters, &
tempereth by them, hys vnyuersall
worke at hys heauenly pleasure.
To the lowar planetes thys
mynde or power adioined the inferyour
mindes, and taught them
the true offyces of their admynystracyons.
These starres (sayth
he) shall engender the cloudes,
these shall prouoke the wyndes.
This admixture shal bring forth
increase, this wil minister famine.
That planete shal moue battail,
that planete shall cal vpō peace.
That starre engēdereth a scarsenesse,
that starre wyll brynge habundaunce.
Some causeth men
to take thought, some moueth thē
again to reioice. Some bringeth
men a loste, some agayne throwe

them vnder foote. Of some of
these bodyes take vertues theyr orygynall,
of other taketh rote such
inordinate loue as bringeth forth
all fylthy lyuynge. One starre anoyeth,
an other prospeareth, in
kyngdomes beynge at variaūce.
One wyll take awaye lyfe, an other
wyll geue it. All starres whiche
commenlye alter or chaunge
the corruptyble world from tyme
to tyme, God hath made knowen
to the ethereall spretes. So hathe
his eternal good minde towardes
man, geuē rules and arte to moue
that wayghtye worke of hys, and
by those iust lawes, the starres do
gouerne the world. The mynde
sent into this corruptible bodi, entereth
as doth a maier into a citie,
& that body as a lyttle pryson, becommeth
a subiecte to the sowle.
            
               
As a place of exyle to the lyuely
spretes, hath god appointed that
myserable bodye, that they maye
therin brydle all worldly affeccions
by offyces of iustyce and godly
workes of faythe. Thys lyfe is
lyke an horse waye, and as it wer
a great Theatre or place where
people do assemble to behold sō
               dry
feates, where euery man receiueth
prayse or autoritie accordynge
to hys fyne doynges. Eche
manne laboureth for hys parte.
Some there are whych seketh to
get heauen, & some ronne headlynges
to the deuyll, and axe all
their fryndes no leaue. Lyke as
the superyour spretes, haue a superyour
sprete whych ruleth thē,
so hath the inferyour mynde a gouernaunce
ouer the inferiour mē
               bers.
In his power is it, to represse

all yre & to asswage both glottenouse
and lecherouse affectes, also
to subdue all fylthy couenaūts
To that intent (o my mynde) hath
God made the maister ouer all
these members, that thu shuldest
with all spede subdue faythfully,
that hys lawes hath forbydden
the. Hyde not the powers whych
he hath lyberally gyuen the, neyther
yet withhold them from due
exercyse, cōsyderynge the charge
is left to, thy arbytryment. As the
eternall God, & the great mighty
heauen with the elementes, is
called the greatter worlde, so are
we here named the lesser worlde.
Yea, we I say agayn, for in dede
we are many thynges, whō a serten
copulacyon maketh one, and
that is called the lesser worlde. Al
that we se done in the greatter

worlde, we maye in lyke manner
beholde nowe in our selues. The
hart, the lyuer, and the heade, are
in vs as the heauens, the senses
are as the starres, the mynde ioyned
wyth reason and vnderstandynge,
is in vs as God. All other
thynges, if we dylygently search,
wyll seme within manys body, to
do theyr diuerse offices. The four
humours are vnto the, as the .iiii.
elementes, and that commeth of
them, thou shalte iustlye call the
myxt or componed bodyes. Into
dyuerse kyndes generall, maye
these be dyuyded, and into specyall
matters also. Many of them
wanteth life, yet is there in vs all
kind of liuelines. The heares ar
in maner as a wode or forest, the
vncomly partes may be cōpared
to beastes vnreasonable. The
fleume or reume which issueth frō
               
the ouermost partes of the head,
maye wele be taken for the rayne
showres droppyng out of ye skye.
As a ragynge floude shall that
moyst humour be, whych cōmeth
fourth of the nosethrylles. The
wynde of the stomacke, the pauch
and bellye euermore retayneth.
And as the angels do mynyster
vnto God in great nomber, in the
higher world, so hast thu alwaies
here bineth moch copy of spretes
assistēt euer vnto the. Some ther
be, whych are engendered of the
liuer, some are created of the hart,
some fatche their oryginal frō the
ouermour fortresse of the heade.
These be the instrumentes of thy
bodely powers, & swiftly thei rōne
ye way which thu appointest them
Thu therfor art the god, yu art the
first power of this thy world, & by
yt meanes haste yu the rule of thys

lesser world. Be therfore watching,
& take vpō the that autorite &
lawes whych are gyuen the. Loke
vp towards heauen, & se how the
starres holde their course without
breache of order. O vndyscrete
mynde, why sorowest thu?
yea, why so fearest death, as one
of thy self forgetfull? Thu ydyote
fole, why delightest yu so moche
in that wretched body? Call thy
wyttes to the, as yet dispersed, or
dyuersly affected to thinges whiche
are corruptyble. And fall not
from God for thynges so deceytfull
and vayne. Conuert the vnto
thynges whych are essencyally
good, and shall neuer perysh,
whych are celestyall causes, and
lete no paines that are to be takē
for gods honour terrify ye. A battayie
must be (no questyon) no tryumph

is obtained without fight,
neyther yet any garlande geuen
but to hym that manfully stādeth.
God is the rewarde of thys conflyct,
so is heauen the eternall stipend.
Lete these gyftes prouoke
ye to esteme thys battayle so much
the lyghter. For cherefully shalt
yu passe after deathe, into the plesaunt
campes of heauen. Conuenyent
is that place to them which
hath mynded eternall thynges.
The spretes of heauē will receiue
the, as a fryndely companyon of
theirs, into the portalles of clerenesse,
where as thu shalt fynde very
commodyouse dwellynges.
Thus shalt thu at ye latter, come
from greuouse cares and frō lōg
contynued troubles, into a peaceable
rest, and mansyon of quyetnesse.
In the paradyse aboue, or

like place of pleasure, among the
departed saints, shalbe thy cotynuaunce
hauynge euermore all
the heauens at thy pleasure. Amonge
other habundaunte feastes
& plenteouse bankettes, thu
shalte taste of immortall waters
and delycates vuspeakeable.
A celestyall songe wyll be vttered
at those recreacions, and so
sweete melodyes as are able to
moue ye starres. With the saintes
departed hēce shalt thu liue, and
with them shalt thu reigne in heauen,
so much glory herafter shalt
thu haue, & so much heauenly honour.
In that place is eternal quiet,
in that place is eternal plesure
& a life replenished with felicityt
perpetuall. O folysh mynde, why
waylest thu: why hast thou such a
feare to death, and art become as

a parsone all wytlesse? Thu insipient
sot, why dost thu so moch regard
that carrayn carkeys, Thu
fearest the departure of thy body
that latter conflicte troubleth thy
weakenes, excedinge doubt hast
thu of the tyckle name of deathe.
Uery certain is it, that the mortal
body shal return to earth, yet wil
not that slepe be continual. Our
sowles must again returne to the
bodies, and the members shalbe
restored to their righte places.
Why then doste thu folyshly fear
consyderynge that in deathe are
no doloures? If anye sorowe be
founde therein, it ryseth of a desperate
feare. Do fearfulnes therfor
awai, & death wil be but a slepe
Yea, it will apeare a wonderfull
quyet, the senses wythdrawē frō
the feble weake bodye. The ignoraūce

of causes, maketh death
to men rerrible, but he little knoweth
what he feareth, which feareth
hys owne death. Where as
syckenesse begynneth myghtely
to inuade the feble hart, in all ye
whole bodye besydes, the senses
waxe dulle. The battayle anon
after ceaseth, so soone as nature
gyueth place to hys mortall poison,
& the enemy obtayneth vyctory.
Then is strēgth ouerthrowen,
a colde fayntenesse so entereth
in by force, & wasteth awaye
the aydynge or confortes of lyfe.
Anon Death beholdinge a farre
of, hys banner erected, entereth
the members quyetlye subdued.
For syckenesse fyrst of al beynge
the wyly wepon bearer of death,
secretly seketh destrucciō by pryuye
assaultes. Neyther trumpet

nor waytes, nor yet brasen horne
maye gyue warnyng, no, neither
mouth nor armour maye seme to
make any manner of dinne, as is
heard in other skyrmishes. That
sycknesse as a prompt warriour,
shuld be ready at the walles with
out warnynge gyuen, whyche is
to destroy the body vnbewares,
God hath appointed him to haue
swyft fete. These are the armyes
of deathe, wyth these souldiours
doth bytter syckenesse fyght, and
is as a messenger sent fourth before
that vngentle Deathe. And
as concernyuge hys diffinicion,
Deathe is a swyft flyght or passage
from the corruptyble body,
rather to be desyred, than to be
fled from, of men that are godly.
O folysh mynde, why sorowest
thu thē? yea, why fearest yu death

as one forgetfull of thy self? Whi
dost thu vndyscretely loue that
frayle body of thyne: Sceuola ye
noble Romane contempned the
death, so ded the valiaunt Greke
Achilles, with many other renomed,
worthye, and excellent captyues
more, sett it all together
at nought. Yea, some which haue
had no hope of the lyfe to come,
neyther haue they knowne of our
christen faythe, yet haue they estemed
the death as nothyng. Now
to the, whych hast rereyued holy
baptym, and to whome the clere
light of the gospel hath bene minystred.
Thu hast lesse strengthē
thē a Pagane, for thu vnfaithfully
fearest the deathe, yet knowest
it of suertie yt death bringeth with
it a moch more excellent & precyouse
kinde of lyfe then was the other.

Neuerthelesse if thu saye vnto
me, yt in deathe are such signes
of dolour, as are able to moue the
most myghty and valiaunt harts
For so much as we behold in dayly
experyence both the eyes and
the mouthes of them that depart
at the fearful enteraunce of death
to haue mooste wonderfull mouinges,
Take thys for an earnest
warnynge, and be not deceyued
with so doutful similitudes, neither
yet faynt at them as doth an
olde dottynge gossyp. For take
this of me. If the sycke creatures
which are at the poynt of deathe,
do shew such terrible tokēs, it mai
not be reckened that they come of
the extreme paines or grefes of the
body. Many vain fantasies doth
occupy the imagynacyon of the
minde, and they trouble the soule,

& brynge the hart in much feare.
In profe of thys, we haue hearde
it ofte reported, that menne manye
times in a rage, haue leaped
down from hygh hilles and depe
buyldynges to their deadly parell.
Thys hath only their deceitfull
ymagynacyon wroughte in
them, and not the payne whych
hath come of theyr greuous sickenes
When the fyre is ones put to
the straw and the stocke throughly
kyndled, thyncke heauynesse
ryghtly to be represented or sygnyfyed.
O mynde, why art thu sorowful?
and wherfore fearest thu
deathe, forgettynge thy selfe, so
madly? O imprudent asseheade,
why louest thu that frayl body of
thyne so inordynatly: Why goest
thu so farre out of square, that thu
so much regardest thynges mortall?

and wylt neyther regard thy
oryginal nor yet wherto thu wert
created? whyles yu hast a spiritual
power, and thy first formacion
from heauen, why is it thy desyre
to dwel styll in thys earthely pryson?
What haste thu to do wyth
stones insensate? why settyst thu
so much by vile earthe & by clay?
Thu bearest the symylytude and
true image of god. Leaue to brute
beastes thys earthly, dwellynge,
for heauen is thy due herytage.
Thys worlde is to vs, no contrey
natyue, but a very vncommodyouse
exile, I pray the thē tell me,
why dost thu preferre this wylde
place of thy bānishment, to the plesaunt
land thu art borne to? yea,
why haddest thu rather to be locked
vp in that darke dongiō, thē
to enioye the cōmodytees of that
fredome? A swete thynge were it

for the, from hence to be remoued
to the plesaunt socyete of the olde
holy fathers, and so to beholde
those men, which haue of the scriptures
most worthi praises. What
syght in the worlde can be to vs
more delectable: thē in one place
to beholde all ages, or men of all
generacions sens the worldes beginninge?
If it chaunce to come
into thy head to feare ye tormētes
of helle, or doubtest to be brent in
the burnynge lake therof? Thu
oughtest first to cōsydre, that god
is no enemy to vs mortall creatures.
Unsemynge is it that he be
reckened an vngentyll or vnmercyful
father. As it becometh him
of his godly nature to be pityful,
so is he of vs to be reckened very
pytieful For he that thinketh him
to be without merci, doth not rightly
iudge hym a father. No, no, he

accounteth hym to be no father.
For what mad man wold graunt
him to be a God, whom he cā iustly
denye to be mercyfull? God is
our vnyuersal goodnesse. Al thinges
that are precyouse and hyghlye
to our profyt, god ministreth.
But what thyng cānyst thu iudge
to be more better thā mercy? why
sorowest thu then, thu waueringe
mynde? yea, why fearest yu death,
forgetfull of thy self? How cōmeth
it to passe thu dottynge fole, that
thu art so carefull for that wretched
bodi of thine? The high heauen
loketh for the, the prynces famyly
there doth call the by name,
and also the holy senate or counsell
of the eternall father, do couete
the very moche. Tell me ernestly,
why dost thu loue thyne
own dammage? why dost thu desyre
thyne owne hurte or decaye?

Dost thu not thynke that a want
or losse is a great discommodite?
Shew me by thy faith, O minde
vnquiet, why dost thu feare to resort
to such places, where as non
are but thy fryndes? why dost thu
doubt payne? why dreadest thu
punyshmente? If thy conscience
beare the wytnesse of most greuouse
synnes, and so accombre
the, repēt them wyth al thy hart.
For repentaunce taketh al sinne
away. We are certaine and sure,
what the gentilnesse, the clemency,
and the mercy is, of oure heauenly
father. Yea, we perfyghtly
know it, how swiftly he will bend
hym selfe, to heare oure humble
prayers. If we do wele, we shall
gyue to God our hartes, & wyth
bytter teares we shall do sacryfyce
to hym. No offerynge in the
worlde, can be more acceptable

or plesaunt vnto him. If thu bewayle
or lament thy synnes, such
a gentyll father hast thu, as wyll
clerely remyt them. God alone requyreth
a contryte hart. He onlye
accepteth an humble request. God
doth not regarde the smoky sacrifices,
neyther yet is he pacyfyed
with aulters nor with offeringes
if the harts religion be wanting.
A yonge sprynge wyll bow wyth
a westerne winde, with a string is
a bow made croked. Fire melteth
stele, bloud breaketh an adamāt
& god is mollified by lowlines of
the hart. Leaue your eartheli care
or study, ye most filthy bandes or
mortal mēbers. Giue ouer thy possessiō,
yu stinking dōgiō, & trouble
no more the mindes yt are godlie.
Worship, plesure, honour, possessiōs,
with other cōmoditees worldly,
are subiect to fortune and destenye.

These be the thynges that
rauysh those myndes which haue
no foresyght, and throwe them in
to hel. These are the snares that
are wont to detayne vs, and lette
vs in all good workynge. O my
christen sowle, I tel thys tale to
the. Body and goodes with other
lyke, wyll perysh, as thynges corruptyble
and mortall. Thu only
shalt contynue as a thing immortal.
Thu art the doughter of the
eternal god, my gentyl minde, desyre
thy fathers kingedome than
wyth a cherefull countenaunce.
Runne to thy lounig father, slyde
into his bosom, hold him, embrace
him, & kisse him, for he with al his
housholde, wyll most louingly receiue
the. Garlands prepare thei
to thy head, a semely white garmēt,
beutified wt stars & fine gold
shall reache to thy verye feete.

Thu shalt wonder to behold the
innumerable multitude of saintes,
clappynge hādes and reioycynge
at thy commynge. In such
peace and concorde agreeth the
heauenlye cytiezens, that theyr
loue ouerfloweth, as doth a great
myghty sea. The partycular armes
or sygnes of honour, obtayned
by valeauntnesse of mannehead,
causeth one man to be knowen
frō an other. But loue hath
an other propertye. He suffereth
nothing to be particular. As charite
is cōmon, so maketh he al cō
               mon
to all mennys needes. For
nothyng holdeth a perfyght loue
to hys owne vse only. O vndyscrete
mynde, why sorowest? yea,
why fearest deathe so vnwysely?
O dottynge fole, why fauourest
that vyle carrayne of thyne so
muche? Then wyth a good harte

and wyllyngly, ouerleape ye thre
sholdes of deathe, and fear in no
wise the fantastical name therof.
            ¶Thus endeth the lamentable songe or
complayute of Baptista Mantuanus,
that deathe is not to be feared,
familyarly translated
into Englysh by
Iohn Bale.
