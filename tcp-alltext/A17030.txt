            THE ARRAIGNment, Conuiction and execution of certaine Witches at Northampton, the 22. of Iuly last past.
            
               AMongest the rest of sinnes where-with the perfection of God is most of all displeased in the corruption of man, There is none (I suppose) more distastfull or detestable to his Purity, then this damnable and Deuillish sinne of Witchcraft; For that it seemes to make an eternall seperation, and an irreconciliable diuorce betwixt the pure Mercies of God, and the tainted soules of such miserable people: Who for the most part, as they are of the meanest, and the basest sort both in birth and bréeding, so are they the most vncapeable of any instruction to the contrary, and of all good meanes to reclaime them.
            
               But as there are many, that remaine yet in doubt whether there be any Witches, or no, or any such spirits, who offer their seruice vnto them, or rather who by fained seruice doe tyrannize ouer them: So to answere their doubts, would aske a greater labour, and perhaps more art, and better experience then I intend, or happily can shew. Onely this, that if neither those confutations that are already learnedly set forth, Nor ancient records of the Witches called Druides, in old time confinde into the Isle of Man, nor the ordinary reportes of the strange mischiefes done by the Witches of Norway might séeme sufficient proofes of this matter: Yet mee thinkes that the common experience, which our learned and Reuerend Iudges of the Land, finde daily in their yéerely Circuites by the conuictions of suth offendors, and the plaine and manifest Euidences brought in against them, who being in this this kinde dangerously infected, haue from time to time stood foorth vpon their Arraignement, and as their 
                  •…
               ues haue béene held to bée the most detestable, so their deathes haue béene obserued to proue the most desperate, might put it out of question, that some such there be abroad in the world, who by the damnable practise of Witch-craft haue sold themselues to the Deuils seruies. In regard whereof I may conclude, that either it must be granted that there are Witches both in name, and nature, or else the Oppositors, that being (I suppose) more precise then wise, standing rather vpon the singularity of their owne opinions, then the certainty of Reason or Iudgement, must needs doe palpable wrong and open Iniury to the discretions, or consciences

of our learned Iudges, and the power and vertue of our Lawes, in the excecution of Iustice, making that hated, and vnheard off Tyranny, which is done by the lawfull power and vertue both of the Soueraigne, and Subordinate authority.
            Some doe maintaine (but how wisely let the wiser iudge) that all Witchcraft spoken of either by holy writers, or testified by other writers to haue béene among the heathen or in later daies, hath béene and is no more but either méere Cousinage, or Collusion, so that in the opinion of those men, the Deuill hath neuer done, nor can do any thing by Witches. It may be, some will say, what hurt can grow from this opinion? The hurt that may ensue and grow thereof, none can tell that hath not first séene somewhat by experience. Wée all sée that one kernell of Wheat béeing sowne, a whole eare growes vp, and sometimes brings forth an hundreth kernils in it. If an error be planted, who can tell what increase it▪ may yeild in time? The ground doth not bring forth the corne with such increase as the heart of Man doth errors. If we draw in one linke of a Chaine, anether followes, and is by and by in sight, which draweth wée knowe not how many after it, vntill we sée the last. There is no Error that goeth alone, or that is not linked vnto another. That holy Wrytte therefore (which makes the Man of God perfect and perfectly instructed vnto euery good worke) must iudge and decide the controuersie in this case. Let vs then sticke vnto the same for testimony and proofe.
            
               
               What a Witch is, and the Antiquity of Witchcraft.
               TO know things aright and perfectly, is to know the causes thereof. A Definition doth consist of those causes which giue the whole Essence, and containe the perfect nature of the thing defined: where that is therefore found out, there appeares the very cléere light. If it be perfect, it is much the greater, though it be not fully perfect, yet it giueth some good light.
               For which respect though I dare not say, I can giue a perfect Definition in this matter, which is hard to doe euen in knowne things, because the Essentiall forme is hard to be found, yet I doe giue a Definition, which may at the least giue notice, and make knowne what manner of Persons they be, of whom I am to speake. A Witch is one that worketh by the Deuill, or by same Deuillish or Curious Art, either hurting or healing, reuealing things secret, or foretelling things to come, which the Deuill hath deuised to entangle, and snare mens soules withall, vnto damnation. The Coniurer, the Enchaunter, the Sorcerer, the Deuiner, and whatsoeuer other sort there is, are indéed compassed within this circle. The Deuill doth (no doubt) after diuers sorts, and diuers formes deale in these: But no man is able to shew an Essentiall difference in each of them from the rest.

I hold it no wisedome, or labour well spent to trauell much therein; One Artificer hath deuised them all▪ They are all to one end and purpose, howsoeuer they much differ in outward Rules for practise of them, that is little or nothing besides meere delusion. Euery Man will confesse that the father of lies is not to be trusted. Euery man knowes that all his dooings are hidden vnder coulorable shewss. Shall wée then seeke for stedfastnes in his wayes? Shall wée be so foolish as to imagine that things are effected by the vertue of words, gestures, figures, or such like? All those are doubtlesse but to deceiue, and draw men forward, and so plung them more déepely into sinnes, and errors.
               Touching the Antiquity of Witchcraft, wée must néeds confesse that it hath béene of very ancient time, because the Scriptures doe testifie so much, for in the time of Moses it was very rife in Egipt, Neither was it then newly sprong vp, beeing common, and growne vnto such ripenes among the Nations, that the Lord reckoning vp diuers kinds, saith that the Gentiles did commit such abhominations, for which hée would cast them out before the Children of Israel. How long it was before that time cannot for certainty be discussed: Sauing that (as is sayd) it was not young in those daies when Moses wrote. If wée mainetaine that it was before the flood, there is great reason to iustify the Assertion. Wée know that the Deuill was excéeding crafty from the beginning, alwaies laboring to seduce, and deceiue after the worst manner. If he fayled of his desire, it was because Men had not procured Gods displeasure to

come vpon them, to deliuer them ouer vnto strange delusions, but God complaineth, that men had wonderfully corrupted their waies, long before the Flood: God beeing then prouoked by the wickednesse of the world, what should make vs doubt but that through his Iust iudgement the Deuill had power giuen him and was let loose, that he might seduce, and lead the prophane Nations into the depth and gulfe of all abhominable sinnes? Thus much concerning the certainety of Witches, and the Antiquity of Witchcraft, This that followes shall in some sort shew their Diuil

               The Arraignement and Execution of Agnes Browne, and Ioane Vaughan or Varnham his daughter, who were both executed at Northampton the 22. of Iuly last.
               
                  THis Agnes Browne led her life at Gilsborough in the county of Northampton, of poore parentage and poorer education, one that as shée was borne to no good, was for want of grace neuer in the way to receiue any, euer noted to bee of an ill nature and wicked 
                     〈◊〉
                   position, spightfull and malitious, and many yeeres before shee died both hated, and feared among her neighbours: Beeing long suspected in the Towne where she dwelt of that crime, which afterwards proued true. This Agnes Browne had a daughter whose name was Ioane Vaughan or Varnham a maide (or at least vnmaried) as gratious as the mother, and both of them as farre from grace as Heauen from hell.
               This Ioane was so well brought vp vnder her mothers elbow▪ that shee hangd with her for company vnder her mothers nose. But to the purpose. This Ioane one day happening into the company

of one Mistris Belcher, a vertuous and godly Gentlewoman of the same towne of Gilsborough. This Ioane Vaughan, whether of purpose to giue occasion of anger to the said Mistris Belcher, or but to continue her vilde, and ordinary custome of behauiour, committed something either in spéech, or gesture, so vnfitting, and vnséeming the nature of woman-hood, that it displeased the most that were there present: But especially it touched the modesty of this Gentlewoman, who was so much mooued with her bold, and impudent demeanor, that shée could not containe her selfe, but sodainely rase vp and strooke her, howbeit hurt her not, but forced her to auoide the company: which this Chicken of her Dammes hatching, taking disdainefully and béeing also enraged (as they that in this kind hauing power to harme, haue neuer patience to beare) at her going out told the Gentlewoman that shee would remember this iniury, and reuenge it: To whom Mistris Belcher answered, that shée neither seared her nor her mother: but bad her doe her worst.
               This trull holding her selfe much disgraced, hies home in all hast to her mother, and telles her the wrong, which shée suggested Mistris Belcher had done vnto her: Now was the fire, and the tow met, all was enflamed: Nothing but rage and destruction: Had they had an hundred Spirits at command, the worst, and the most hurtfull had béene called to this counsell, and imployed about this businesse. Howbeit vpon aduise (if such a sinne may take or giue aduise) they staied thrée or foure daies before they practised any thing, to auoide

suspition, whether the mother aduised the daughter, or the daughter the mother I know not, but I am sure the deuill neuer giues aduise to any man or woman in any act to be wary.
               The matter thus sléeping (but rage and reuenge doe neuer rest) within a while was awaked, which Mistris Belcher to her intollerable paine too soone felt: For being alone in her house, she was sodainely taken with such a griping, and gnawing in her body, that shée cried out, and could scarce bee held by such as came vnto her, And being carried to her bed her face was many times so disfigured by béeing drawne awrie that it bred both feare, and astonishment to all the beholders, and euer as shee had breath, she cried, Heere comes Ioane Uaughan, away with Ioane Uaughan.
                  
               
               This Gentlewoman béeing a long time thus strangely handled, to the great griese of her friends, it happened that her brother one Master Auery, hearing of his Sisters sicknesse and extremity came to sée her, and béeing a sorrowfull beholder, of that which before hée had heard, was much mooued in his minde at his Sisters pittifull condition, and the rather for that as hée knew not the nature of her disease, so hée was vtterly ignorant of any direct way to minister cure or helpe to the same. Hée often heard her cry out against Ioane Vaughan alias Varnham, and her mother, and heard by report of the neighbours that which before had happened betwixt his Sister, and the said Ioane: In so much as hauing confirmed his suspition that it was nothing else but Witch-craft that thus

tormented his Sister, following Rage rather then Reason, ranne sodainly towards the house of the said Agnes Browne with purpose to draw both the mother and the daughter to his Sister for her to draw bl

                  ud on: But still as hee came neere the house, hee was sodainely stopped, and could not enter, whether it was an astonishment thorough his feare, or that the Spirits had that power to stay him I cannot iudge, but hee reported at his comming backe that hee was forcibly staied, and could not for his life goe any further forward, and they

                  eport in the Country that hee is a Gentleman of a stoute courage: Hee tried twice or thrice after to goe to the house, but in the same place where hee was staied at first, hee was still staied: Belike the deuill stood there Centinell, kept his station well.
               Upon this Master Auery béeing sory and much ag ieued that hee could not helpe his Sister in this tormenting distresse, and finding also that no physicke could doe her any good or easement, tooke a sorrowfull leaue and heauily departed home to his owne house.
               The Impe of this Damme, and both Impes of the Deuill, beeing glad that they were both out of his reach, shewed presently that they had longer armes then he, for he felt within a short time after his comming home that hee was not out of their reach, beeing by the deuillish practises of these two hel-hounds sodenly & grieuously tormented in the like kind & with the like fits of his sister, which continued vntill these two witches either by the procurement of

Maister Auery and his friends (or for some other Diuillish practise they had committed in the countrey) were appr

                  ole where theoe Witches were detained, hauing once gotten sight of them, in their fits the Witches being held, by scratching they drew blood of them, and were sodainely deliueted of their paine. Howbeit they were no sooner out of fight, but they fell againe into their old traunces, and were more violently tormented then before: for when Mischiefe is once a foote, she growes in short time so heaost

                  ong, that she is hardly curbed.
               Not long after Maister Auery and his Sister hauing beene both in Northampton and hauing drawne blood of the Witches, Ryding both homewards in one Coach, there appeared to their view a man and a woman ryding both vpon a blacke horse, M. Auery hauing spyed them a farre off, and noting many strange gestures from them, sodainely spake to them that were by, and (as it were Prophetically) cryed but in these words▪ That either they or their Horses should presently miscarcy, And imediately the hor

fell downe dead. Wherevpon Maister Auery rose vp praysing y• grace and mercies of God, that he had so powerfully deliuered them, and had not suffered the foule spirits to worke the vttermost of their mischiefe vpon men made after his image, but had turned their fury against Beasts. Upon this, they both hyed them home, still praysing God for their escape, and were neuer troubled after.
               I had almost forgotten to tell you before, that M. Auery was by the Iudges themselues in y• Castle yard of Northampton, séene in the middest of his fits, and that he strangely continued in them vntill this Ioane Vaughan was brought vnto him.
               But now to draw néere vnto their ends, this Agnes Browne and her daughter Ioane Vaughan, or Varneham béeing brought to their Arraignement, were there indighted for that they had bewitched the bodies of Maister Auery and his sister Mistris Belcher in manner and forme aforesayd, Together with the body of a young Child to the death (the true relation whereof came not to my hands) To all which they pleaded not guilty, and putting themselues vpon the couutrey were found guilty. And when they were asked what they could say for themselues, why y• sentence of death should not be pronounced against them, they stood stiffely vpon their Innocence. Wherevpon Iudgement béeing giuen, they were carried backe vnto the Gaole, where they were neuer heard to pray, or to call vppon God, but with bitter curses and execrations spent that little time they had to liue, vntill the day of their Execution, when neuer asking pardon for their offences either of God, or the world, in this

their daungerous, and desperate resolution, dyed.
               It was credthly reported that some fort-night before their apprehension, this Agnes Browne, one Ratherine Gardiner, and one Ioane Lucas, all birds of a winge, and all abyding in the Towne of Gilsborough did ride one night to a place (not aboue a mile off) called Rauenstrop, all vpon a Sowes backe, to sée one mother Rhoades, an old Witch that dwelt there, but before they came to her house the old Witch died, and in her last cast cried out, that there were three of her old friends comming to sée her, but they came too late, Howbeit shee would méete with them in another place within a month after. And thus much concerning Agnes Browne, and her daughter Ioane Varnham.
               
            
            
               
               The Arraignement, Conuiction and Execution of one Arthur Bill of Raundes in the County of Northampton.
               
                  THis Arthur Bill, a wretched poore Man, both in state and mind, remained in a towne called Raunds in the County aforesayd, begotten and borne of parents that were both Witches, and he (like a gratious Child) would not degenerate, nor suffer himselfe to stray from his fathers wicked Counsels, but carefully trode the steps that hée had diuillishly taught him.
               This Arthur Bill was accused that he should bewitch the body of one Martha Aspine alias Ieames, the daughter of one Edward Aspine of the same towne, to death. But this matter remaining doubtfull that it could not be cléerely tryed vpon him, hée béeing strongly suspected before, by bewitching of Diuers

kinds of cattle, to be guilty of that crime, And béeing also publiquely knowne to bée of an euill life and reputation, together with his father and mother. The Iustices and other officers (thereby purposing to trie the said Arthur by an experiment that (many thinke) neuer failes) caused them all to bee bound, and their Thumbes and great Toes to bée tied acrosse, and so threw the father, mother and sonne, and none of them sunke, but all floated vpon the water.
               And hereby the way, it is a speciall thing worthy generall noting and obseruation, that there are two signes or tokens which are tokens as more certaine, then others, to detect and find out Witches by. The one is the marke where the Spirits sucke, and the trying of the insensiblenesse thereof. The other is their fléeting on the water. Concerning which though I dare affirme nothing for certainty, there béeing (for ought I know) neither euident proofe in nature, nor reuelation from heauen to assure vs thereof: yet mée thinkes I may say the like of this, as is held of the bléeding of a slaine body in presence of the mutherer. For as in a secret murther, if the dead Carkase bée at any time either seene or handled by the murtherer, it doth streitway gush out of blood, as if the blood should by issuing foorth in such strange manner cry vnto heauen for reuenge of the murtherer, God hauing as may séeme appointed, that secret supernaturall signe for triall of that secret vnnaturall crime, that the blood left in the body should thus appéere,

and as it were challenge the murtherer, for that blood whi

minde, they both ioyned together, and bewitched a round ball into the Throat of his Father, where it continued a great while, his Father not beeing able to speake a word. Howbeit the ball was afterwards had out, and his Father prooued the principall witnesse against him.
               His Mother for feare of hanging, (not any hatred, or detestation shee bare vnto the sinne) many times fainted, and would often pitifully complaine vnto her Spirit, that the power of the Law would bée stronger then the power of her art, and that she saw no other likelihood, but that shee should be hanged as her Sonne was like to bee: To whom her Spirit answered, giuing this sorry comfort, that shee should not bee hanged, but to preuent that, shee should cut her owne throate: Shee hearing this sentence, and holding it definitiue, in great agony, and horror of minde and conscience fell a rauing, crying out that the irreuocable Iudgement of her death was giuen and that shee was damned perpetually, cu

               Her Neighbours often hearing her bitter execrations bad her call vpon God, and to be sorry for the sinnes which shée had committed, But shee could in no case endure to heare it: And hauing thus for 3. or 4. daies tormented herselfe in this Agony, at last she made good the Deuils word, and to preuent the Iustice of the Law, and to saue the hangman a labour, cut her owne throat.
               Her Sonne beeing all this while in prison, and

hearing of his Mothers death, and that his Father was become a witnesse against him, was much perplered in his minde, that his Mother was dead, in whom he most trusted, and his Father liuing, whom he most feared, Howbeit hee stiffly stood still in the deniall of euery thing, pleading nothing but his innoceney, Notwithstanding that hee had before at vnawares confest, that he had certaine Spirits at commaund, which béeing imployed, would doe any mischiefe to any man, woman or child that hée would appointe.
               It said is that hee had thrée Spirits to whom hée gaue thrée speciall names, the Diuell himselfe sure was godfather to them all, The first hée called Grissill, The other was named Ball, and the last Iacke, but in what at shapes they appeered vnto him I cannot learne. For Diuels can appéere both in a bodily shape, and vse spéech and conference with men. Dur Sauiour saith, That a Spirit hath neither flesh nor bones: A Spirit hath a substance, but yet such as is inuisible, whereupon it must néedes bée granted, that Deuils in their owne nature haue no bodily shape nor visible forme, it is moreouer against the▪ Truth and against Piety to beléeue, that Deuils can create, or make bodies or change one body into another, for those things are proper to God.
               It followeth therefore that whensoeuer they appeare in a visible form, it is no more but an apparition and counterfeit sh

to beare the likenes of another, it is but a colour. Some man will say, what reason is there to shew they can doe so much, beeing of an essence inuisible? Wee may not stay heere within the limits of our owne reason, which is not able to comprehend, what way Deuills should be able to worke such operations. Wée may not (I say) measure their power, and subtilties in working for our owne capacity and vnderstanding: But wée must looke what the Cannon of Scripture doth testify in this behalfe. Wée haue manifest proofe that the Deuill can take a bodily shape. For when Aaron had cast downe his staffe, and it was turned into a Serpent, The enchaunters of Egypt cast downe their staues, and they became Serpents, which was indéed but in shew, and appearance, which the Deuill made, For he deluded the Sences both in hiding the forme of the Staues, which indéed were not any way changed: As also in making a shew of such bodies, as were not.

man) lying in prison from the 29 day of May to the 22 of Iuly following, many resorted to him, willing him to leaue off all colour and dissimulation, and not to suffer his Conscience to double with his Tongue, But to cleere his heart and his thoughts before the Maies

               But his Conscience béeing feared, and his heart stéeld, could receiue no impression, but stood like an Image of Adamant, more easy to be broken in péeces, then bée peirced. In this obduracie of mind and Spirit hée continued vntill the

               Uppon the verdict whereof, his countenance changed, and he cried out, that he had now found the Law to haue a Power aboue Iustice, for that it had condemned an Innocent.
               It séemes to me that these vilde Spirits, which these Witches haue at commaund, and by their imployment are suffred to haue power to hurt the bodyes of others, haue a greater Power ouer them that set them a worke, For they doe not onely féed vppon them participating with the blood of humane

flesh for the redemption wherof Christ shed his owne precious blood, But it appeares that they haue also power euen ouer their Soules, leading them into wandring by-waies, and such erroneous Laberinths, that in the wilfull obstinacie and peruerse sufferance of their owne minds to stray in this daungerous desart of obduracie, they are lost for euer.
               But to conclude with this Arthur Bill, that se ill concluded with the world, He béeing brought to the place of Execution, and standing vppon that fatall stage for offenders, pleaded still his innocencie, that Authority was turned to Tyranny, and Iustice into extreame Iniury, to the great wonder, and disdaine of all the lookers on.
               Thus with a dissembling Tongue and a corrupted Conscience, hee ended his course in this world, with little hope or respect (as it séemd) of the world to come.
            
            
               
               The Arraignement, and Execution of Hellen Ienkenson.▪
                  
               
               
                  THis Helen Ienkenson dwelling at a Towne called Thrapston in the County of Northampton, was noted a long time to be of an euill life and much suspected of this crime before her apprehension, for bewitching of Cattle and other mischiefes, which before time she had done.
               This Helen was apprehended for bewitching of a Child to death, and committed to Northampton Gaole the 11 of May last by Sir Thomas Brooke of Okeiy Knight. A little before whose apprehension, one Mistris Moulsho of the same Towne (after she was so strongly suspected) getting her by a wyle into a place conuenient would néeds haue her searched, to sée if they could find that insencible marke which commonly all Witches haue in some priuy place or other of their bodies. And this Mist

                  is Moulsho was one of the chiefe that did search her, and found at the last that which they sought for to their great amazement: at that time this Mistris Moulsho had a Bucke of clothes to be washt out. The next morning the Mayd, when shée came to hang

them forth to dry, spyed the Cloathes, but especially Mistris Moulshoes Smocke to be all bespotted with the pictures of Toades, Snakes, and other ougly Creatures, which making her agast, she went presently and told her Mistris, who looking on them, smild, saying nothing else but this; Heere are fine Hobgoblins indéed: And béeing a Gentlwoman of a stout courage, went immediately to the house of the sayd Helen Ienkenson, and with an angry countenance told her of this matter, threatning her that if her Linnen were not shortly cléered from those foule spots, she would scratch out both her eyes: and so not staying for any answere went home, and found her linnen as white as it was at first. This Helen being brought to the barre, and béeing indicted of the murther of the Child, pleaded thereunto not guilty, but the verdict béeing giuen vp against her, shée cryed out, woe is mee, I now cast away, But (like the rest) did stoutly deny the accusations, and sayd that she was to die an Innocent, I thinke as Innocent as the rest: And at the place of Execution made no other confession but this, That she was guiltlesse, and neuer shewd signe of Contrition for what was past, nor any sorrow at all, more then did accompany the feare of death. Thus ended this woman her miserable life, after she had liued many yeares poore, wretched, scorned, and forsaken of the world.

So without any confession or contrition, like birds of a feather, they all held and hanged together for company, at Abington gallowes hard by Northampton, the two and twintith day of Iuly last past: Leauing behinde them in prison many others tainted with the same corruption, who without much mercy and repentance are like to follow them in the same tract of Precedencie.
