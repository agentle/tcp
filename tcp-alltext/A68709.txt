            THE KINGS MAIESTIES DECLARATIOVN
            
               FOR ſamekle as thair is ſome euill affect it men, that gois about, ſo fare as lyeth in thame, to inuent lies and calumnies, to ſtanȝie & impair the Kings Maieſties fame and honour, and raiſis brutis, as gif his Maieſtie had declynit to Papiſtrie, and had, made many actis, to derogate the frie paſſage of the goſpell, gude ordour and diſcipline in the kirk: Quhilk brutis are nuriſhit and interteneit be rebellious ſubiects quha wald glaidly couer their ſeditious interpriſes, vnder Pretext of Religioun (albeit thair can be na godly Religioun in ſic, as raiſis armour, and diſquietis the eſtate of their natiue Souerane, and periuritly hes contrauenit the aith, band and obligation of their faith, quhairvnto they haue ſworne and ſubſcryuit.) Thairefore, that his Maieſties faithfull ſubiectis be not abuſit with ſic ſclanderous reports, and his Hienes gude and affectionat freinds in vther countries may vnderſtand the veritie of his vpricht intentioun, his Hienes hes commaundit

this breif declaratioun of certaine of his Maieſties actis of Parliament haldin in Maij 1584. to be publiſhit and imprentit, to the effect, that the indirect practiſes of ſic as ſclanderis his Maieſt. and his lawis, may be detectit and diſcouerit.
            IN the firſt act, his Maieſtie ratifeis and appreuis the trew profeſſioū of the Goſpell, ſinceir preaching of the word, and adminiſtratioun of the Sacramentis, preſently be the gudenes of God eſtabliſhit within this Realme: & allowis of the confeſſioun of the faith ſet doun be acte of Parliament the firſt ȝeir of his Maieſties Regne. Lyke as his Hienes not only profeſſis the ſame in al ſinceritie, bot prayſit be God, is cum to that maturitie of iudgement, be reiding and heiring the word of God that his Hienes is able to conuince and ouerthrawe be the doctrine of the Prophetis and Apoſtles, the moſt learnit of the contrary ſect of the aduerſaries: Sua that: as Plato affirmes that cō
               moun wealth to be moſt happie, quhairin ane Philoſophour regnis, or he that regnis, is ane Philoſophour: we may mekle mair eſteeme this countrie of Scotland to be fortunat, quhairin our King is ane Theologue, & his hart repleniſhit with the knawledge of the heauenly Philoſophie, for the comfort not onely of his gude ſubiects and freinds in vther countries; bot of them that profesſis the goſpell eueriequhair: He being ane King of great expectatioun, to quhom his birthricht hath not only deſtinate and prouydit great kingedomes, bot mekill mair his Hienes vertew, godlines and learning, and daylie increſſe of

all heauenly ſciences, dois promeis and aſſure him of the michtie protection of God, and fauoure of all them that fearis his holy name.
            IN the ſecoūd act, his Maieſties royall authoritie ower all eſtaites, both ſpirituall and temporall, is confirmit. Quhilk act, ſome of malice, and vtheris of ignorance dois traduce, as gif his Maieſtie pretendit to be callit the heid of the Kirk, Ane name quhilk his Maieſt. acknawlegis to be proper and peculiar to the ſonne of God, the Sauiour of the warld, quha is the heid, and beſtowes life ſpirituall vpoun the members of his miſticall bodie: and he hauing reſſauit the holie ſpreit in all aboundance, makis euerie ane of the faithfull pertakers thairof, according to the meſure of faith beſtowit vpoun thame. Of the quhilk number of the faithfull vnder the heid Chriſt, his Maieſt, acknawlegis him ſelfe to be ane member, baptizit in his name, partaker of the myſterie of the croce and holie communioun, and attending with the faithfull for the cumming of the Lord, and the finall reſtitutioun of Goddis elect. And notwithſtanding his Maieſtie ſurelye vnderſtandis be the Scriptures, that he is the cheife and principall member, appointed be the lawe of God to ſee God glorifiit, vice puniſhit, and vertue mainteinit within his realme: and the ſoueraine iudgement for ane godly quietnes and ordour in the commoun wealth, to apperteine to his Hienes cair and ſollicitude. Quhilk power & authoritie of his hienes, certaine Miniſters, being callit before his Maieſt, for their ſeditious & factious ſermonis

and ſteiring vp of the people to rebellion aganis their natiue King, be the inſtigatioun of ſindrie vnquiet ſpirits, wald in na wayes acknawlege, bot diſclamit his Maieſt. authoritie, as ane incompetent Iudge. And ſpecially ane callit M. Andro Meluile, ane ambitious man, of ane ſalt and fyrie humour, vſurping the pulpit of Sandrois without ane lawfull calling, and privie at that tyme to certaine conſpiraceis attemptit aganis his Maieſtie and Croun, went about in his ſermon vpon ane Sonday, to inflāme the hartis of the People, be odious compariſons of his Maieſties progenitours and counſale; Albeit the dewtie of ane faithfull Preachour of the Goſpell be rather to exhort the people to the obedience of their natiue King, nor be popular ſermonis, quhilk hes bene the euerſioun and decay of great cities and common welthis, and hes greatly in times bygane diſquietit this eſtate, to trouble and perturbe the countrey. The ſaid M. Andro wllit before his Hienes, preſumptuouſlie anſwerit, that he hald not be iugit be the King and Counſale, becauſe he had ſpok in the ſamein pulpit, quhilk pulpit, in effect, he allegit to be eximit from the Iugement and correction of Princes. As gif that holie place, ſanctifeit to the word of God, & to the brekking of the bread of life, micht be ane cullor to eny ſedition in word or deid, aganis the lawfull authoritie, without puniſhement. Alwayis his Maieſtie (being of him ſelfe ane maiſt gratious Prince) was not willing to haue vſit ony rigour aganis the ſayde M Andro, gif he had humbly ſubmittit him ſelf▪ acknawled git his offence, and creuit pardon: quha notwithſtanding

affrayit of his awin gyltines, being priuie to dyuers conſpiraceis of before, fled into the Realme of England. quhais nauchty and preſumptuous refuſing of his Hienes iudgement, was the occaſioun of the making of the ſecound act, That nane ſoulde declyne his Hienes authoritye: in reſpect that the common prouerbe beiris, Ex malis moribus bonae leges natae ſunt, that is, Of euill maners gude Lawes procede. And in verie deid it laketh not ane richt intollerable arrogancie in ony ſubiect, callit before his Prince, profeſſing, & authoriſing the ſamin treuth, to diſclame his authoritie: nether do the Prophetes, Apoſtles, nor vthers conductit be the ſpirit of God, miniſter the lyke example. For it is a great errour to affirme, as mony do, that Princes and Magiſtrats hes only power to take ordour in ciuile effaires, and that Eccleſiaſticall maters dois only belang to the miniſtry. Be quhilk meanis, the Pape of Rome he exemit him ſelf & his clergie from al iugement of Princes, and hes made him ſelf to be Iuge of Iuges, and to be iugit of na man: quhair as, be the contrair, not only be the exāples of the godly gouernouris, Iuges and Kings of the ancient Teſtament, bot alſo be the new Teſtament, and the haill hiſtory of the primitiue kirk, in the quhilk, the Emperours iugeit ouer the Biſhoppes of Rome, depoſit them from their ſeates, appointit Iudges to cognoſce & decyde in cauſis Eccleſiaſticall, vindicat innocent men, as Athanaſius, from the determinatioun of the concile haldin at Tyrus, and be infinite gude reaſouns, quhilk fall be ſet doun, be the grace of God, in ane

ſeuerall work, ſalbe ſufficiently prouen and verifeit. Bot this appeareth at this preſent to be ane vntymely and vnprofitable queſtioun, quhilk hes no ground vpoun their parte, bot of the prepoſterus imitatioun of the pretendit iuriſdiction of the Pape of Rome. For gif their were ony queſtioun in this land,, of hereſie, quhairby the profound myſtereis of the Scriptures behouit to be ſearchit furth, his Maieſtie wald vſe the ſamin remedy (as maiſt expedient) quhilk the maiſt godly Emperouris hes vſit: and his Maieſtie, following their example, wald conuene the counſell of learnit paſtours, that be conference of Scriptures, the veritie micht be opinnit, and hereſie repreſſit. Bot, praiſit be God, we haue no ſic controuerſies in this land, nather hes there ony hereſie taken ony depe rute in the cuntrey: bot certane of the miniſtrie, ioyning tham ſelfis to rebellis, hes trauellit to diſquiet the eſtate with ſic queſtiouns, that the people micht imbrace ane ſiniſtre opinioun of his Maieſties vpright proceidinges and factiouns micht be nuriſhit and intertenyit in the cuntrye. Nather is it his Maieſt. meaning nor intention in ony ſort to tak away the lawfull and ordinarie iudgement in the Kirk, quhairby diſcipline and gude ordour micht decay: bot rather to preſerue, maintene, & increſſe the ſame. And as thair is in the Realme Iuſtices, Conſtables, Shirreffis Proueſtis, Bailleis, and vtheris Iudges in temporall materis, Sa his Maieſtie allowith, that all things micht be done in ordour, and ane godlie harmonie may be preſerued in the haill eſtait, the ſynodall aſſembleis, be the Biſchoppes: or commiſſionaris quhair the place vakis, to

be conuenit twyſe in the ȝeir, to haue the ordinarie tryell of materis belonging to the miniſtrie and thair eſtait: Alwayes reſeruing to his Hienes, that gif they or ony of thame do amiſſe, neglect their dewty, diſquiet the eſtate, or offend in ſic maner & ſort, that they in no wayes pretend that immunitie priuilege & exemptioun quhilk onely was inuentit be the Papes of Rome, to tred vnder fute the ſceptres of Princes, and to eſtabliſh ane Eccleſiaſticall tyrannie within this cuntrey, vnder pretext of new inventit preſbyteries, quhilk nather ſould anſwer to the King, nor biſhop vnder his Maieſt. bot ſould haue ane infinit iuriſdiction, as nather the law of God, nor mā can tolerate. Quhilk is only his Maieſt. intentioun to repreſs, and not to tak away ony godly or ſolide ordour in the Kirk, as heirefter ſall appeir.
            THe ferd act of his Maieſt. foreſaid Parliament, diſcharges all iugementis Eccleſiaſticall, and all aſſembleis quhilk ar not allowit be his Maieſt. in Parliamēt, quhilk act ſpecially concernis the remouing and diſcharging of that forme lait inuentit in this land, callit the preſbyterie: quhairin ane nūber of miniſteris of ane certane precinct & bounds, accompting thame ſelfis all to be equall, without ony difference, & gaddering vnto thame certane gē
               tilmen and vtheris of his Maieſteis ſubiectis, vſurpit all the haill Eccleſiaſticall iurisdictioun, and alterit the lawes at thair awin appetite, without the knawledge & approbation of the King or the eſtate. Ane forme of doing without ony exampill of ony natioun, ſubiect to ane

Chriſtian Prince. The perrell quhairof did ſa incres, that in cace, in dew ſeaſoun it had not bene repreſſit and forbidden be his Maieſt. lawes, the ſamin had troublit the haill cuntrie. And it being tryit be his Hienes to be the ouerthraw of his Maieſt. eſtait, the decay of his Croun, and ane reddie introductioun to Anabaptiſtrie and popular confuſioun in all eſtaites, his Maieſtie hes contramandit the ſame. And that the Reidar may vnderſtand the danger thairof be mony incōuenientis quhilk thairby inſewit in this land, I will only ſet down ane, quhairby ȝe may vnderſtand quhat perrell wes in the reſt. The Ambaſſadour of France returning hame to his awne cū
               trie, the Kings Maieſtie cōmandit the Proueſt, Bailleis, & Conſale of Edinburgh to gif him the bāket, that he micht be dimiſſit honorablie, according to the amitie of ancient tymes betuix the twa nationis. This command wes geuin on ſettirday be his Hienes: and the banket appointit to be on the mounday. A nōber of the foirſaid pretendit preſbyterie vnderſtanding thairof, convenit them ſelfis on ſonday in the morning, & preſumpteouſly determinat & agreit, that the Miniſteris of Edinburgh ſuld proclame ane faſting vpon the ſamin monunday, quhair thrie ſeuerall Miniſteris, one efter ane vther, made thrie diueris ſermonis invectiues aganis the Proueſt, Bailleis, and Counſale for the tyme, and the noble men in the cuntrey, quha aſſiſtit the banket at his Maieſt. command. The foirſayd preſbyterie callit and perſewit thame, and ſcarſlie be his Maieſteis authoritie culd be withhaldin from excommunicating the ſaidis Magiſtratis and noblemen,

for obeying onely his Hienes lawfull commaund, quhilk the law of al cuntreyis, callit Ius gentium, requyris towards Ambaſſadours of foraine cūtreis. And not only in this, bot innumerable vther things, their cōmandemēt wes opponit directly, vnder the pane of excōmunicatiō, to the K. Maie. & his lawes. Quhilk forme of doing ingē
               derit nothing bot diſquietnes, ſedition, & trouble: as may manifeſtly appeir, in that, the ſpeciall authoris of the inuenting, promoting, and aſſiſting of the foirſaid pretendit preſbytereis, hes ioynit thame ſelfis with his Maieſties Rebels: and fleing furth of the realme, in reſpect of their giltines, hes diſcouerit quhat malicious practiſes wes de uyſit amāgis thame, gif God had not in tyme prouidit remedie. The vther forme of Iugement quhilk his Maieſtie hes diſchargit, is the generall aſſemblie of the haill Clergie in the Realme: vnder pretence quhairof, ane number of Miniſteris from ſindrie Preſbitereis did aſſemble, with ſum gentlemē of the countrie, quhairof ſum for that tyme malcontents of the eſtate, ſocht that cullour as fauoriſeris of the miniſtrie, be the quhilk they haue practiſit mony interpriſis in the realme: quhair there wes no certane law in Eccleſiaſticall effaires, bot all dependit vpon the ſayd generall conuentioun, quhair the lawes of the Kirk were alterabill efter the pluralitie of votis, quhilk for the maiſt part ſuccedit vnto the maiſt vnlearnit of the multitude. This generall aſſemblie amāgis vther things did appoint and agrie with his Maieſt. regentis in his Hienes minoritie, that the eſtate of biſhoppes (quhilk is one of the eſtates of Parliament) ſuld be maintenit & authoriſit:

As it is regiſtrat in the bukes of counſell, and ſubſcryuit be the commiſſioners for the tyme. Quhilk order wes obſeruit many ȝeiris, and Biſhops be their conſentis, appointit to the dioceis, quhill within this lait tyme, in aſſembleis haldin at Dundie and Glaſgovv, reſpectiue, the foirſaid miniſters and aſſemblies, tuke vpoun them, contrary to their awin hand writ, to diſcharge the eſtate, and to declare the ſamyn to be vnlawfull, in their pretendit maner. And there cōmandit the Biſhops of the countrey to demit and leaue their offices and iuriſdictions, and that in na wayes they ſould pas to the Kings Maieſties counſell, or parliament, without commiſſioun obtenit from their aſſemblie: That they ſould vote na thing in Parliament and counſell, bot according to their actis & Iniunctions. And farder, they directit their Commiſſioners to the Kings Maieſtie, commaunding him and the Counſel vnder the pane of the cenſuris of the kirk (quhairby they vnderſtude excommunication to appoint no Biſhop in tymes to cum, becaus they had concludit that eſtate to be vnlawfull. And notwithſtanding, that quhilk they wald haue deiectit in the biſhops, they contendit to erect in thē ſelfis, deſyring that ſic commiſſioners as they ſuld ſend to parliament & counſel, micht be authoriſit in place of the eſtate, quhairby it ſuld haue cū to pas, that quhair as now his Maieſtie may ſelect the maiſt godly, learnit, wyſe and experimentit of the miniſtrie, to be on his Ma.eſtate, his Hienes ſuld haue bene be that meanes compellit to accept ſic as the multitude, be ane od vote of the maiſt vnlearnit ſould haue appointit: quhilk could not tend bot to the ouerthrow

of the Realme, quhairof that eſtate hathe bene ane ſpeciall ſtoupe. Efter they had diſchargit Biſhops, they aggreit to haue Superintendentis, Commiſſionaris and viſitouris: bot in the end, they decernit that thair ſuld be no difference amangis the Miniſteris: and imaginit that new forme of preſbyterie, quhairof we haue ſpokin before. Nether was there ony vther appearaunce that they ſould haue ſtayit from ſic daylie alterationis in the commoun wealth, quhilk could not bot continually be diſquiettit, quhair the law of conſcience, quhilk they maintenit be the ſword of curſing, wes ſubiect to ſic mutationis, at the arbitriment of ane number, quhairof the maiſt part had not greatlie taiſtit of learning. Attour the foreſaid aſſemblie wes accuſtumit not onely to preſcryue the lawe to the King and eſtate, bot alſo did at certane tymes appoint generall faſtingis throughout the Realme, ſpecially quhen ſome factioners in the cuntrey was to moue ony great interpriſe. For at the faſt, all the Miniſteris wes commandit be the ſayde aſſemblie to ſing one ſong, and to crye out vpoun the abuſes, as they termitit, of the Court and eſtate for the tyme: quhairby it is maiſt certaine great alterationis to haue enſewit in this land, quhill at the gude pleaſour of God, and his bliſſing towardis his Maieſtie, the pretext of the laſt faſt wes diſcouerit, and his Hienes delyuerit from ſic attemptatis: quhairby his Maieſtie hathe bene iuſtly mouit to diſcharge ſic conuentionis quhilk micht importe ſo preiudicially to his eſtate

Bot ſpecially his Maieſt. had no ſmall occaſion, quhairas the ſamin aſſemblie being conuenit at Edinburgh, the 
                   _____ 
                day of 
                   _____ 
                did authoriſe and avow the fact perpetrat at Ruthvē, in the taking of his Hienes maiſt noble perſone. The quhilk deid, notwithſtanding his Maieſtie with the aduyſe of his eſtates in Parliamenthes accompted to be treſſonable, the ſaid aſſemblie eſteming their iugemēt to be the ſoueraine iugemēt of the realme, hes not only approvin the ſame, bot ordanit all thame to be excommunicat quha wald not ſubſcryue & allow the ſamin. Sua the actis of this aſſemblie, and the lawes of the eſtate directly fechtand in ciuill materis, with the quhilk the aſſemblie ſould not haue midlit, it behouit his Hienes, ether to diſcharge him ſelf of the Crowne, or the miniſtrie of that forme of aſſemblie, quhilk in very deid, in the ſelf, without the Kings Maieſties licence and approbation culd not be lawfull. Lyke as generall councilis at no tyme could gudely aſſemble, bot be the commandement of the Emperour for the tyme: & our King hath no les power within his awne realme, than ony of thame had in the Empyre. Zea, the Biſhop of Sanctādrois had not, in tyme of Poperie, power to convene the biſhops and clergie, out of his awne Dioceſe, without licence impetrat before of his Hienes moſt noble progenitours of gude memorie, and the eauſis thairof intimat and allow it. Notwithſtanding, that his Maieſties intentioun and meaning may fullelie be vnderſtaund, It is his Hienes will, that the Biſhop or Commiſſionar of ony dioceſe or prouince, or part thairof, ſal at their viſitatioun

appoint in euery paroche, according to the gretnes thairof, ſum honeſt, vertuous and diſcreit men, to concur and aſſiſt the Miniſter, and to haue the ouerſicht, and cenſure of the maners and behauiour of the people o that parochin. And gif their be ony notable offence worthie of puniſhment, that the Biſhop and Commiſſionar be aduertiſit thairof, quha ſhall haue ane officer of armes, to concur with his decreit, for the puniſhment of vice, and executions to follow thairvpoun: that they quha contē
               nis the godly and lawfull ordour of the kirk, may find be experience his maieſties diſpleaſure, and be puniſhit according to their deſeruings.
            And forder, his Maieſtie vpoun neceſſare occaſiouns, quhilk may fall furth be dyuers maners of wayis amang the clergie, vpoun humble ſupplicatioun maid vnto his Hienes will not refuſe to grant them licence to cōuene: To wit, the Biſhoppes, Commiſſioners, and ſome of the maiſt verteous, learnit & godly, of their dioceis, quhair ſic Eccleſiaſticall maters, as appertenis to the vniformitie of doctrine, and conſeruation of ane godly ordour in the kirk, may be intreatit & concludit in his Maieſties awin preſence, or ſome of his Maieſteis honnorable counſell quha ſal aſſiſt for the time. Quhair, gif neceſſitie ſo require ane publict faſt throuchout the hail Realme may be decernit, and be his Maieſt, authoritie proclamit, to auoyd the imminent diſpleaſour and daunger of the wraith of the Lords iudgements: quhilk is the richt end of publict humiliatioun: and not vnder pretext theirof, to couer ſic interpryſes, as hes heirtofore greatly diſquyetit and troublit

the peax of this common welth.
            THE xx. act ratifeis and approuis, and reſtabliſis the eſtate of the biſhoppes within the Realme, to haue the ouerſicht and iuriſdictioun, euerie one in their awin dioceis. Quhilk forme of gouernamēt, and reule in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, hes not onely continuit in the kirk, from the dayis of the Apoſtles, be continuall ſucceſſioun of tyme, and many Martyrs in that calling ſhed their blude for the treuth: bot alſo, ſen this Realme imbracit and reſauit the chriſtian Religioun, the ſame eſtate hes bene maintenit, to the weilfair of the kirk, and quyetnes of the Realme, without ony interruptioun, quhill within thir few ȝeirs, ſome curious and buſie men haue practiſit to induce in the Miniſtrie, ane equalitye and paritie in althings, alſweill concerning the preiching of the worde, miniſtratioun of the Sacraments, as lykewayes in diſcipline, ordour and policie. The quhilk confuſion his Maieſtie finding be maiſt dangerous experiēce, to haue bene the mother and nuriſh of great factions, ſeditions & troubles within this Realme, hes with aduiſe of his Hienes eſtates, maturelie and aduyſitly concludit the ſaid pretendit paritie in diſcipline, ordours and policie in the kirk, to be na langer tolerat in this countrie: bot the ſollicitude and cair of ma kirks of ane dioceſe, to apperteyne to the biſhop and commiſſionar thairof, quha ſall be anſwerable to God, and his Maieſtie, and eſtates, for the richt adminiſtratioun and diſcharge of the office of particulare Miniſters, within the bounds of their iuriſdiction. For

as it becūmis his Maieſtie, as Euſelius wrytis of Conſtantinus the great, to be ane Biſhop of Biſhops, and vniuerſall Biſhop within his Realme, in ſa far as his Maieſtie ſould appoint euery ane to diſcharge his dewtie: ſwa his Hienes can not, his countrey being large and great, take him to euerie Miniſter that ſall offend, and tranſgreſſe aganis dewtie, or querrel with the haill nomber of the Miniſtrie: bot it behoueth his Maieſtie to haue Biſhops and owerſears vnder him, that may be anſwerable for ſic bounds, as the law and ordour of the countrey hes limitat and appointit vnto euerie ane of thame. And that they hauing acces to his Maieſt. parliament and counſel may interceid for the reſt of the brethren of the Miniſtrie, propone their greifs vnto his Hienes and eſtatis, and reſſaue his Maieſt. fauourable anſwer thairin. The quhilk forme dois preſerue ane godly harmony, vnitie, concorde, and peax in the eſtate, and ane ſolide ordour in the kirk.. As contrariwyſe, the pretendit equalitie deuydis the ſamin, and vnder pretext of equalitie, makes ſome of the moſt crafty and ſubtill dealers to be aduancit and inrychit: and in pretending of paritie, to ſeik nathing bot their awin ambitioun. & aduancement aboue the reſt of the ſimple ſort. And notwithſtanding that his Maieſtie hes reſtabliſhit the ſaid eſtate, it is not his hienes will and intention, that the foirſaid biſhop, ſall haue ſic full power, as to do within his dioceſe quhat he pleaſis. For as his Maieſtie cā not allow of ane populare confuſion, quhairin▪ as the prouerbe witneſſis, Nulla tyrannis aequiparanda eſt tyrannidi multitudinis, That is, No tyrannie can be comparit to the

tyrannie of ane multitude, hauing commandement and power in their hands: Sua vpoun the vther part, his Ma. will is, that the Biſhops authoritie in ony graue mater, be limitat, & circumſcryuit to the counſell of XIII of the maiſt ancient, wiſe, and godly paſtours of his dioceſe, ſelectit furth of the haill ſynodall aſſemblie of the prouince: be quhais aduiſe, or at the leaſt the maiſt part thairof, the graue and wechtie effairis of the kirk may be conductit and gouernit, to the glorie of God, and quyetnes of the realme. Forther, it is his Hienes will, & expres commandement, that thir biſhops, or commiſsionars, twyſe in the ȝeir, to wit, ten dayes efter the Paſche tyme, & the ſext of September, hald their ſynodall aſſemblies, in euery dioceſe, for the keping of gude ordour thairin. And gif ony be refractar or contemnar within their bounds, of the gude ordour of the kirk, they may be declarit vnto his Maieſtie, and puniſhit, in exemple of vthers, according to their deſeruings. Nather is it his Maieſt. meaning or intentioun, that ſic biſhops or commiſsionars, as ſall be appointit, ſall reſſaue their only and full commiſsioun of his Maieſtie, without admiſsion ordinar, be ſic as are appointit to that effect, in the kirk: bot hauing his Hienes nominatioun, preſentatioun, and cōmendatioun, as lawfull and only patroun, they to be tryit, and examinat, that their qualiteis ar ſic, as they are able, and ſufficient to diſcharge their cure and office. And gif it ſall happin ony of the ſaidis biſhops, or commiſsionars, to be negligent in their office, or to be ſclanderous and offenſiue in their behauiour, lyfe, and maners, in ony tyme cumming,
