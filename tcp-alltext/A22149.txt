            To all to whom theſe preſents
ſhall come, greeting.
Whereas wee haue bin lately
informed, that the Seas neere
and about the parts of Wintertonneſſe
in our County of Norffolke
are of great danger and perill for paſſing of
Ships ſayling vnto the North Coaſt in darke and
foule nights, by reaſon of a Sand lying in length
from the maine land two furlongs or there abouts,
vpō the which of late yeares many great loſſes haue
happened to our Subiects ſayling neere the ſame
Coaſt, aſwell by the lamentable wracke of diuers
Ships there as by the loſſe of many of our ſubiects
their liues and goods, which haue beene occaſioned
by the want of Light howſes and lights that might
haue beene prouided and ſet vp, at or as neere the

ſaid Neſſe for direction of Saylers trading or paſſing
to and fro thoſe parts which by the helpe of ſuch
Light-houſes and lights might haue well bin ſaued
and preuented. And that for the ſcaping and preuenting
of the dangers of thoſe parts for the time to
come, it is very conuenient and neceſſarie that light-howſes
ſhould be there erected with lights therein
continually burning, and maintained in the night
time, for the direction and ſafe conduct of Shippes
paſſing by or alongſt the ſaid coaſt in the night time
in darke and fowle nights, and that almoſt all the
maſters and owners of Shippinge, trading to our
Towne of Newcaſtle for Coales, Fiſhermen and other
Maiſters and Owners of other ſhipping, tratrading
vppon the ſaid North coaſt, haue heretofore
greatly deſired the erection of light-houſes & lights
there to be ſet vp and maintayned, and haue offered
to contribute for, and towards the erection and continual
maintenance of the ſame, as by an inquiſition
or certificate taken at the Cittie of Norwich in the
Coūty of Norffolke the eight day of Ianuarie laſt paſt
before Iohn Corbett, Iohn Smith, Owen Sheppard,
and Roger Godſalue, Eſquires: our Commiſſioners
by vertue of Our Commiſſion vnder our great
ſeale of England, baring date at Weſtminſter the ſixteenth
day of December laſt paſt, vnto them and others
directed by the oathes of ſundry good & lawfull
men of our Townes of great Yarmouth and
Winterton in the ſaid County, and returned into and
remaining of record in our Court of Chancery: amongſt
other things more at large it doth and may
more appeare. Wee therefore out of our princely

office and care intending heereafter to prouide for
as well the ſafety of the liues and goods of our ſubiects
& others as of the ſhipping of our Kingdomes,
(being a principall honour & ſtrength of the ſame)
and vnwilling that our louing ſubiects and others
paſſing by the ſaid North Coaſt ſhould vndergoe &
continue ſtill vnder the danger and hazard of the
ſaid perilous Sands whereunto by woefull experience
they haue heretofore beene too much ſubiect.
And hauing beene enformed by our learned Counſell
that the erection and mayntenance of ſuch Light-houſes
and Lights in places needfull for the ſafetie of
our ſubiects, is a right and power remaining in vs,
notwithſtanding the power or authoritie heretofore
giuen by the ſtatute made in the eight yeare of the
Raigne of our late decre Siſter Queene Elizabeth to
the Maiſter, Wardens, and Aſſiſtants of the Trinitie-houſe
of Debtford Strond for erecting of Beacons,
Signes, and Sea markes, haue thought fit and neceſſarie,
and by theſe preſents wee doe for vs, our Heirs &
ſucceſſors, will ordaine and appoynt that ſome one
or more conuenient Lighthouſe or Lighthouſes ſhall
be erected made and ſet vp, at or neere ſuch fit and
conuenient place or places at or within the ſpace of
two miles of Winterton aforeſaid as by the perſons
heereafter by vs named & authoriſed in that behalfe
their Executors, Adminiſtrators or Aſſignes their
ſubſtitute or ſubſtitutes or ſome or one of them ſhall
be thought meete and neceſſarie from time to time
and that continually in the night ſeaſon in darke &
foule nights ſufficient lights ſhall therein by the
perſons hereafter named their Executors or Aſſignes,

ſubſtitute or ſubſtitutes, or ſome or one of
them and at their proper coſts and charges from
time to time be kept and maintained for the direction,
condition, and preſeruation of Ships, Hoyes,
Barkes, Fiſhermen or other veſſells whatſoeuer
which ſhall ſaile or paſſe by or alongſt the ſaid North
Coaſt, and that as well the ſaid Lighthouſe or Lighthouſes
which ſha I hereafter be by them ſo built and
erected, ſhall or may from time to time by the ſaid
perſons hereafter by vs named and appoynted their
Executors, Adminiſtrators, or Aſſignes, ſubſtitute
or ſubſtitutes bee altered, renewed, remoued, and
changed as by the accidents and mooueables, and
channels at or neere Wintertoneſſe aforeſaid ſhal or
may require for the ſafer conduction & guiding of
Saylers ſhips, Fiſher-barkes, and other veſſells
whatſoeuer, paſſing or repaſſing from Port to
Port, by or alongſt the ſaid Coaſt as well by night
as by day.
            And for aſmuch as the erection, reparation, remoouing,
changing, and continuall maynteyning of the
ſaid Light-houſes and Lights in the ſame there Will
from time to time require a great and continuall
charge for the ſupportation and maintenance of the
ſame. Wee will, ordaine, and appoynt for vs our
Heyres and ſucceſſors that there ſhall be collected
and taken of an for euery Shippe, Hoy, Barke,
Fiſherman, or other veſſell whatſoeuer that ſhall
paſſe from porte to porte by or alongſt the ſaid
North Coaſt a duty or payment of one penny vppon
the Tunne according to the burthen of the ſaid
ſhippe, Hoy, Barke or veſſell, in the whole voyage

outward and inward, (that is to ſaye) one halfe
penny vpon euery Tuune for the ſaid whole voyage
outward and inward of and from the Maſters
or owners of ſuch ſhippes, Barkes, Hoyes,
and veſſells & one other halfe penny vpon euery
Tunne as aforeſaid of and from the Marchants or
owners of the goods in the ſaid Shippes, Barkes,
Hoyes or veſſells for the time being, which ſaid dutie
or payment of one penny to be paied vpon euery
Tunne as aforeſaide wee will ſhall bee deliuered
and payed to the hands of ſuch officer and officers
or other perſon or perſons as the perſons hereafter
named, or either of either of them, their, or eyther
of their executors Adminiſtrators or aſſignes
or any of them ſhall nominate, depute and appoynt
in any our cuſtome-houſes, to receiue and take the
ſame by the Maſters and owners of the Shippes,
Hoyes, Barkes or veſſells, for the time being, who
ſhall and may lawfully demaund, receiue, and take
the moyetie, or one halfe thereof, according to the
true meaning of this our graunt, of, and from the
Marchants & owners of the goods in the Ships,
Hoyes, Barkes and veſſells, from time to time, according
to the quantitie of the goods & Marchandizes
wherewith the ſaid Shippes, Hoyes, Barkes
or veſſells ſhall be fraught or laden.
            And that the ſaid perſons hereafter named, their
or either of their executors, Administrators or Aſſignes,
ſubſtitute or ſubſtitutes one or more of them
ſhall or may likewiſe lawfully demaund, receiue &
take of euery Shippe, Hoye, Barke, Fiſhermen or
veſſell being the Shippe, Hoye, Barke or veſſell of

any Aliene, Denizen or ſtranger, not being our naturall
borne ſubiects, that ſhall happen to ſayle, or
paſſe from port to port, by or alongſt the ſayd North
coaſt, the like dutie of one pennie vpon the Tunne,
in the voyage outward and inward, as aforeſaid,
which we will and ordaine, for vs, our Heires, and
Succeſſors, ſhalbe collected and taken by the perſons
hereafter named, their Executors, Adminiſtrators,
Deputies, or Asſignes, at or in the Port,
Harbor, Creeke, or Roade within in any part of our
Dominions where the ſaid Ships, Hoyes, Barkes
or veſſels of any ſuch ſtranger, ſhall harbor or put in
although the ſame ſhippe, or veſſel ſhall not be there
vnloaded or diſchardged of any the goods or Marchandizes,
wherewith it ſhall be fraught or laden.
            And that the ſame dutie of one pennie vpon the
Tunne as aforeſaid being once paide, and the receipt
thereof being teſtified by thoſe who ſhall be appoynted
to receiue the ſame, the ſaide Maſters and
owners of ſhipps aud other veſſells, aſwell our naturall
borne ſubiects as ſtrangers, ſhall be then freed
and diſcharged of and from the payment of the
ſaide dutie, in euery or any Port or Ports in which

and requiſite, ſuch & ſo many conuenient Lighthowſes,
with continuall Lights to be burning in them
during all the night time, whereby the ſaid Seafaring
men may take notice and be warned of the dangers
thereabouts and ſo be the more able to auoide
and eſcape them, and the ſaid ſhips and veſſells may
the better ariue and come into their Ports and Harbors
without perill, as to them the ſaid Sir William
Erskine and Iohn Meldrum, their Executors, Adminiſtrators
and Aſſignes or any of them ſhall be
thought fit, requiſite and needfull.
            And for the great and continuall charges to be
from time ſuſteyned & borne in and about the erecting
