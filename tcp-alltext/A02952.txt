            ¶A DECLARAtion
of the Kinges pleaſure,
publiſhed after his departure
from Paris: importing the
cauſe of his ſudden and forced
going away.
            
               TRuſty and welbeloued.
Being
in our Towne
of Paris, where
we bent our only
cogitatiōs to
no other thing but the appeaſing
of all ſorts of ielouzies and
diſturbances in Picardy and elſe
wher, which hindered our iourney
into our Country of Poictou,
there to proſecute the warres
enterprized againſt the Huguenotes,
according as we had reſolued,
our coſen the duke of Guize
               
vnwares to vs, did there ariue
the ninth of this moneth. His
comming after that ſort ſo encreaſed
the ſaide ielouzies and
diſtruſtes, that wee were much
troubled therewith: the rather
for that before we had from diuers
places beene aduertized,
that he ſhould come in ſuch maner:
alſo, that he was looked for,
by ſundry the inhabitantes of
the ſame towne, who were ſuſpected
to bee the authors of the
ſaide diſtruſts, beſides that our
ſelfe had before for the ſame
cauſe giuen him to vnderſtād, yt
wee were nothing deſirous of
his comming before we had appeazed
the aforeſayde troubles
of Picardy, and quite taken away
the cauſes of the ſame. Conſidering
neuertheleſſe, that he came
accompanied onely with fourteene
or fiftene horſes, we were

content to ſee him, and that the
rather to the ende to endeuour
ſo to deale with him that all occaſions
of ielouzie and diſtruſt
might be extinguiſhed: wherein
ſeeing how ſmally wee profited,
as alſo that our ſaide Towne
grewe dayly more and more repleniſhed
with Gentlemen and
ſtrangers, retayners to the ſaid
Dukes trayne: alſo, that ſuch
ſearches, as we cauſed the magiſtrates
and officers thereof
to make, were through the fear
wherinto they were driuen, performed
to halues: likewiſe, that
the harts and affections of ſundry
the enhabitants were dayly
prouoked, and more and more
alienated: together with the ordinary
aduertizementes wherby
wee were from time to time
enformed of ſome great troubles
to fal out in ye ſame towne,

we determined to cauſe the ſaid
ſearches to be more exactly performed
throughout al the quarters
thereof thou the former, to
the end thereby to diſcouer and
truely finde out the ſtate of the
ſame, alſo to auoide ſuch ſtrangers
as ſhoulde be found not to
be aduowed as they ought. For
the performance whereof wee
thought it good to ſtrengthen
certaine the bodies of the gardes
of the enhabitants and burgeſes
of the ſame Town whom
we had appointed to be planted
in foure or fiue corners thereof,
with the companies of Suitzers,
and ſuch as were of the regiments
of our guard: who before
were lodged in ye ſuburbs:
alſo to commaunde diuers the
Lords of the counſail & knights
of our order of the holy ghoſt, to
march along the ſtreets & quarters

thereof accompanied with
the quarter maſters and others
the officers of the ſaid Towne,
ſuch as haue bene vſually accuſtomed
to make the ſaide ſearches,
to the end by their countenaunce
to authorize and aſſiſt
them in the ſame, as hath ſundry
times bin practized. Wherof
alſo we gaue notice to the ſaid
Duke, and all the enhabitantes
of the ſaide Towne, leaſte any
thereof ſhoulde take allarom
or any whit doubt of our entent
in this point, which order at the
beginning the Burgeſes and
dwellers ſeemed to take quietly
and in good part: Howbeit
within a while after matters
grewe ſo whot and that the rather
through the induction of
diuers who wandering vp and
downe enformed the ſaid enhabitāts
that we had not brought

in the ſaid forces for auy other
end, but only to eſtabliſh forrein
gariſons within the Towne aforeſaid,
yea, and to deale worſe
then ſo: whereby in ſhort ſpace
they had ſo animated and ſtirred
them vp, that if wee had not
expreſſely forbidden the leaders
of our troopes from attempting
any thing againſt the ſayde enhabitants,
& withall commaunded
them rather to beare and
endure all extremities then to
offer any violence, wee doe vndoubtedly
beleeue that it had bin
vnpoſſible to eſchue the general
ſacke of the Towne and much
bloudſhed. This when we perceiued,
wee determined to ceaſe
the execution of the ſearches aforeſaid,
alſo to cauſe our forces
to retire whome wee had not
brought in, but vpon that onely
occaſion: as alſo it was no other

like, but that if we had mēt
otherwiſe wee woulde haue attempted,
yea, and peraduenture
put in execntion whatſoeuer
our purpoſes before the riſing
of the ſaid enhabitantes, eyther
that they had drawne their
chaynes or erected their defenſes
in the ſtreetes, which immediatly
after noone they went in
hande withall, and in a manner
in one inſtant thronghout all
the ſtreetes of Paris, being thereto
induced and perſwaded by
ſundry gentlemen, Capteines
and other ſtraungers ſent in by
the ſaide Duke of Guize, who to
the ſame end, in very ſhort ſpace
appeared, deuided and aranged,
throughout euery quarter of the
Towne. Hereupon cauſing the
ſayde Switzers and french companies,
to returne, the ſayd enhabitantes
to our great greefe

diſcharged diuers Harquebuze
ſhot, & dealt ſome blowes which
light cheefely vpon the ſayde
Switzers, whome the ſame euening
we commaunded to retire
and lodge about our Caſtle of
the Loure, there to expect the
euent of this commotion of the
ſaid townſe-men: for the appeaſing
wherof, we did all that poſſibly
we could, yea, ſo farre forth
as the next day to procure all
the ſayd companies, except ſuch
as before their comming in we
had placed in guard before our
ſaid Caſtle, to depart the town,
as beeing enformed that in ſo
doing, we might greatly contēt
and pacify the ſaid inhabitants:
as alſo wee cauſed to ſtay ſome
remaynder of the companies of
foote-men of the regiment of Picardy,
albeit they were as yet ſeuen
or eyght leagues off, togither

with diuers Lordes and
gentlemen our ſeruaunts that
drewe vnto vs: as conſidering
yt the ſame had bred ſome ſhadowe
to this people, alſo yt they
took hold of this pretence, wher
by the more to prouoke & ſtirre
them vp. All this notwithſtanding,
in liew of finding our wiſhed
effect to their own benefite
and our contentation, they neuertheleſſe
ſtill proceeded in raiſing
their bulwacks, ſtrengthening
their guarde night & day,
& approching the ſame toward
our ſaid Caſtle of the Loure, euen
to the very ſentinels of our ordinary
guarde, as alſo they ſeazed
vpon the townhouſe of the ſame
towne, togither with the keyes
of S. Anthonies gate and other the
gates therof: ſo that by the thirteenth
of this moneth, matters
were runne ſo farre that it ſeemed

vnpoſſible by mans power
to ſtoppe the effect of greater violence
and commotion, euen before
our ſayd caſtle gates. This
when wee perceiued, and being
neuertheleſſe vnwilling to employ
our ſayd forces againſt the
ſaid enhabitantes, as hauing euermore
helde the preſeruation
of the ſayde Towne with the
enhabitants thereof, as deere as
our owne life, as in ſundry their
occaſions they haue well tryed
and is euident to all men, wee
determined the ſame day to depart,
and rather to abſent our
ſelues, and abandon the place
which aboue all the world wee
moſt loued, and ſo doe ſtill deſire
to doe, then to ſee it encurre further
hazarde or receiue greater
domage: hauing withal entreated
our moſt honourable Lady
and Mother to ſtay, & try whether

ſhe might through her diſcretion
and authoritie in our
abſence bee able to finde anye
means, how to appeaze the ſaid
tumult, which notwithſtāding,
whatſoeuer her endeuours, ſhe
conlde not in our preſence performe,
and ſo are come into this
our Towne of Chartres, from
whence wee thought good immediatly
to ſende you theſe preſentes
therein deſiring you to
conſider of the conſequence of
this cauſe, how preiudiciall and
hurtfull it will be, in caſe it goe
forward, vnto the cōmon cauſe,
eſpecially to our holy catholike,
Apoſtolike and Romiſh religiō,
ſith that they who were wont
to fight togither for the propagation
therof, ſhal through this
accident (if it bee not remedied)
be diſvnited and forced to turne
their weapons eache againſt other:

to eſchue the falling wherinto
we pray you to beleeue that
for our partes we wil do whatſoeuer
poſſibly we may: of ſuch
force is the zeale that we beare
vnto our ſaide religion, as hetherto
we haue ſufficiently cauſed
to appeare. We alſo, ſo much
as in vs lyeth, exhort and pray
you to procure ſupplications to
God in your Churches for this
revnion, as alſo that the obedience
vnto vs due, bee obſerued
according as is meete, and not
to ſuffer the enhabitants of our
Towne of M. to depart the
right pathes thereof: but to admoniſh
and perſwade them to
remaine quiet and conſtant in
their loyalties to their King: &
in vnion and concord one with
an other, ſo to mayntayne and
preſerue themſelues vnder our
obedience, and not to encurre

the diſcōmodities for them prouided,
if they take any other
courſe. Thus beſides that you
ſhal performe an action worthy
your diſcretions, fidelities and
duties, which may bee a notable
example to all ſubiectes, we ſhal
yeelde you thanks for euer, &
acknowledge it to you
and yours.
