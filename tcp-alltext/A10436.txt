To whome Gyngemyn answered / and sayd that y• opynyon was but folysh and agayns all good naturall reason / bycause that all people in y• world of what cōtrey so euer they haue be or be / or of what law & secte so euer they haue be or be / aswel the Panyms / the Iewes / and you that be of Chrystes fayth / & we that be of Machomets law / and all other that euer lyued or do lyue after the order of any good reason / haue euer byleued and do byleue that there is a purgatory / where mannes soules shall be purged after this mortall lyfe. Therfore quod he I meruell greatly that there shuld any suche fond opinyon begynne amonge the people now in any contrey / consyderynge y• there is no reason to maynteyne theyr opynyon that euer I coude here.
            ¶ The reasons of them that holde opynyō that there is no purgatory. To whom Comyngo y• Almayne answered & sayd that they had dyuers reasons to maynteyne theyr opiniō therī / wherof one is this. ¶ They say y• contrycyō whiche some call repentaunce / is that whiche is the very payment and satysfaccyon for synne / and they say that when a man commyttyth a synne / and after is repentaunte therfore / that god of his goodnes doth forgyue hym / and that y• repentaunce is the onely satysfaccyon that god wolde haue to be made and done for that synne. And than syth that a man whiche is a synner / by suche repentaunce hath made suche paymēt and satysfaccyon for his synne as god wolde haue to be made therfore / yf than that man shuld go to purgatory / and haue a new punyshmēt after his deth / that repentaunce that he had before shuld be but voyde.
            ¶ A nother reason / they alege that man was ordeyned and made to haue an infynyte beynge / therfore after this mortall dethe he must haue infynyte ioy or infynyte payne. So thā he is not ordeyned to haue payn in purgatory that hath an ende.
            ¶ A nother reason they alege and that is this. God by the order of his iustyce hath ordeyned heuen / where that good men shall be rewarded / & hell where synners shall be punysshed / and in bothe those places orders and degrees / that is to say / that he whiche deserueth a great and an hye reward shall haue in heuen a great ioye / and he that deserueth a smaller rewarde / shall haue a smaller ioye / and also he that deserueth a great punyshment / shall haue in hell great payne / and he that deserueth a lesse punyshment / shall haue in hell lesse payne. So that whether a man haue deseruyd a great ioy or a small ioy / a great payn or a small payne god may by his order of good iustyce rewarde or punysh hym accordyng to his deseruynge so that there nedeth no place of purgatory.

               THe very operacyon & properte of the reasonable soule is to know and to vnderstande / then yf the grosse body of man be the cawse of the beynge of the soule / so that the soule take his perfeccion ano corrup cyon of the grosse body / then can the soule neuer vse hys operacyon & pro perte wythout the body.

For this we see oft by experyence yt many a man in his slepe dothe speke and moue / and yet he dremeth not / nor seeth no thyng / nor when he is wakynge can nother tell nor remember that he dre med of any thynge / all the whyle that he so spake in his slepe / nor saw no thynge that whyle: & so that somtyme a man speketh and maketh noyse

But yet there is no brute beste in the world whych is able to make any noyse crye / or sowne in his slepe other wyse, yt it is able to do when it is wakynge / but when it is wakynge / it is not able to do any thing / touchyng only the operacyon and properte of y• reasonable soule / for yt can not reken nor count no nombers nor dyscusse what is ryght and wronge / good nor bad / nor make no argumentes nor reasons / whyche operacyon & propertees of the reasonable soule no brute beste can haue nor vse in his slepe / because he can not haue them nor vse them when he is wakyng / but a man hath those propertees of the soule / as well wakynge as slepynge. For wakynge he can reken and counte nō bers and reason and dyscusse what is ryght and wronge / good and bad / and inuente and fynde many sutell reasons and argumentes / whiche the brute beste can not do / a man can also vse the same lyenge a slepe in hys dremys / for many man also beyng a slepe in his dreme / doth fynd dyuers reasons & argumentes ꝓuynge some conclusyon of some scyens and faculte / whych reason cam neuer to hys mynd before whyle he was wakig / also many a man in his dreme hath had dyuers vysyons / & hath forseen & had knowlege of thynges to come / whyche hath afterwarde fallen playn ly and truely accordyng to his vysyon / some of promocyon & wynnyng / and somtyme of losse and bodely hurte / whyche after hath fallen to hym and many a man in his dreme hath seen and knowē his owne destrucciō and dethe.

But fyrste I wyll shewe the an example of thyngys hauynge soule vegetatiue as an apple whyche hath but soule vegetatiue yf such an apple growyng on the tree be hurt with som great stroke / & therby in some parte somwhat rotten & peryshed / & if that apple immedyatly after be pulled frome the tree / now that apple can neuer len ger growe: and then yf thou woldeste kepe that same apple to the intent to serue the at thy table at some grete dyner & feaste that thou woldest af terwarde make to thy frendys & louers / this appell shall not be able than to do to the no good seruyce / because the lenger thou kepeste it / it wyll be wors & worse / and by reason of that stroke it wyll wax more rotten / and at the laste wax all to nought and not able to be eten: and also if thou lay that appell amonge other apples / it wyll infecte all thos appels / whyche lye nygh it / and make them rotten & nought. But yet yf such an appell ha uynge such a stroke growynge vpon the tree / be suffered styll to growe & not pulled of the tree / such an apple oftymes wyll naturally preserue and hele it selfe agayne / and the radycall naturall humour of that appell wyll increase whyle it is growynge / and expulse those humours whyche were corrupte by reason of the sayd stroke / and so make that appell a hole and a sownde appell / able to be kepte to do thy seruyce after at thy table / whē thou shalt make thy dyner and feast to thy frēdes and louers. But yet yf thou take an appell from that tree / whych is a sownde appell but yet it is not fully rype / because there remayneth i it such a sowre watery humour which maketh yt not pleasaunt to be eten / yet yf thou laye that appell in fayre strawe in some howse where the temperate eyer may come to it / thā that eyer wyll puryfye & purge that appell frome that sowre humour and vapour out the tartnes and sowernes of that humour / & so make it melowe & pleasaūt to be eten. So lyke wyse now I may say of a man whych hathe soule intellectyue / yf he be infecte or corrupted withe the stroke of

doynge some great mortall synne and offence agayns god / and than the soule immedyatly pulled & separate frō the body by naturall dethe wythout repētaunce / thā the soule of that man shall neuer be able to be receyued of god / & do hym seruice in heuē / because it hath such a mortall woūd wherby it is infecte & putryfyed not worthy to be admytted to accōpany wyth ye clene pure soules in heuē. And yet yt man whyle his soule was ioy nyd wt y• corruptyble body myght haue takē repētaūce which myght haue restored hym agayne to helthe and to vertue.

Or cllys yf such bestys haue taken some dysease by ex cessyue colde or hete / & the flesh not putryfyed nor corrupte / but bare and lene / and therfore not pleasaunt to be eten for mannys mete: yet yf those best vs be kylled / yet thou mayst make the flesshe of those bestys / though it be neuer so lene by sethynge or rostynge it wyth butter or fat larde to be good mannes mete / and pleasaūt to be eten able to serue the at thy dyner

or feast for thy frendes and louers. So in the same maner it is / whā that a man is infecte wyth a great mortall synne which he hath commytted agayns god.

For as ye see by experyence as the eyer / whych of yt selfe is myche more pure and clene than the element of the yerth / yf there be any corrupt stynkynge water or other humoure vpon yerth / that water or humoure by the hete of the sonne vapored vp in to the hye regyone of the eyer / is there so puryfyed that when yt descendyth it is wythout any corrupcyō stynke or salt taste / but fresh / swete & clere / that yt can neuer be purer / so that the hye region of the elemēt of the pure eyer wyll suffer no water nor other humour to abyde there / whych is not clene and pure.

Than syth that god by hys wonderfull power great wysdome and good nesse hath created those visible thynge / which appere to vs of such puryte and clennes that no fylthy nor foule thyng nor other thynge vnpure can remayne in them or nyghe them / yt semeth than that by all conuenyence of reason yt must nedys folowe that that gloryous place of heuen / whych is a place more hygher and excellent than those other places / which be the regyons elementall and regyons ethereall / and where his mageste is glo fyed / and eternally honoured by his aūgels and sayntes / must be clene & pure fayre / and aboue all other places / and that there can be no thynge suffred to be there / but that whych is all clene and pure wythout any ma ner spotte or token of vnclennes / so yt it foloweth that no soule can be suf fered to be there yt shulde haue any spotte or token of synne in yt / or any maner of deformyte whyche shulde be in any wyse vnpleasaunt. For all though that there be places in heuē some pure and clene / and some more pure & some more clene.

A reall thynge is that whych is perceyued by the organes & instrumentes of the. v. wyttys / as the thyng whych may be seen hard tasted / felt or smelled / be called reall thynges. But racyonall thynges be those whych be not perceyued by y•. v. wyttys / but only be per ceyued by reason / and they be thynges incorporal / as loue / charyte / meke nes / abstynēs / pryde / malyce / slouth and suche other. Further thou must cōsyder that of places there be thre dyuersytees. One is a place contynen tyue / a nother is a place lymytatyue / and the thyrde is a place operatyue. A place contynentyue is that / wherin reall thynges as bodyes / images & figures be cōteyned / as y• tonne wherin the wyne is conteyned / is y• place contynentyue of the wyne. A place symytatyue is / where thynges racyonall and incorporall be lymyted to be / as the place lymytatyue for loue / is that thynge whych is loued / & that thynge whych is so loued / is y• place lymytatyue for that loue / and there the loue is in hys place lymytatyue / whyche place lymytatyue of loue can not be euer certayne but mutable / & because loue may be at onys in dyuers thynges / therfore loue may be in dyuers places lymytatyue at one tyme. A place operatiue is y• place wher the operacyon of the thynge is / as because we see that the meruelous

                     e racyon of god is the meruelous swyft mouynge of the heuēly speres and bodyes aboue / which do appere to vs / therfore we say that the place wher god is / is heuen: so that wher so euer the operacyō of god appereth / there is the place operatyue of god / and there god is. Therfore as touchynge thy questyon where purgatory is / I say to the yt is no place certayne con tynentyue / for that y• a place contynētyue is that whych conteyneth with in yt thynges that be corporall. But because purgatory is a place by god lymyted and ordeyned / for the purgynge of soules / whych be thynges racyonall and incorporall / therfore purgatory can be no place cōtynentyue but purgatory maye be a place lymytatyue / and also a place operatyue. For where so euer that god doth lymyt the soule of man after it is separate from the body to be purged / there is y• place lymytatyue of the soule / and there is the purgatorye of that soule. For there can be no purgatory / but there where the soule is purged / and where so euer god doth lymyt y• soule to be purged / there is y• lymytatyue place of purgatory. Also where the vertuous operacyon of god is / and where hys vertuouse worke doth appere / there is the operatyue place of god / and there god hym selfe is in hys place operatyue: and therfore because the meruelous operacyon and worke of god appereth in euery place of the worlde: therfore god is in euery place and parte of the worlde accordynge as I haue proued to the here before in our fyrst dyaloge. And also because that purgatory where me

                     nys soules be purged is that / where god worketh hys vertuous operation

in execuciō of his iustyce: therfore that purgatory is the very place operatyue of god / whych is in no certayne place contynentyue / but there where pleaseth god / and there & in such tyme / or tymes / where & whē and how his pleasure is that it shall be. Therfore to thy questyon I say / y• pur gatory is no place contynentyue of it selfe / because yt conteyneth no reall nor corporall thynges within it / because it is ordeyned only for purgyng of soules / whych be thynges racyonall and incorporall. Nor also purgato ry is within no place contynentyue / because it is no suche reall thynge of it selfe / that may be perceyued by any of our fyue senses and wyttes.

And mercy is no more but the mynde of a pytefull affecte / and meryte is the execucyon of iustyce / and remyssyon is ye execucyon of mercy: and meryte is alwaye incydent to iustyce / so that god by the order of iustice must gyue to euery creature his own meryte accordyng as it doth deserue to haue / that is to say for synne and offence to gyue punyshment of payne or sorowe / and for vertue to gyue rewarde of ioye or pleasure. And that as meryte is of necessyte incydent to the iustyce of god / so is re myssyon incydent to the mercy of god: so that god can not mynyster hys mercy to no creature without remyssyon. And euery synne that is cōmyt ted / by y• iustyce of god it must haue punyshmēt / and by the mercy of god remyssyon. And as thou dydest graūt me ere whyle / y• synne is alway put away expelled and destroyed by the only medecyne of repentaunce: and than as punyshment by the iustyce of god is incydent to the repentaunce which taketh a way ye synne / so as god by y• order of iustyce ought to gyue punyshment for the synne whyche remayneth / so lyke wyse he ought by y• order of iustyce to gyue remissyon for that medecyn of repentaūce / which hath taken away the synne. And because the iustyce of god and the mercy of god be so correlatyue / that the one can not be wythout the other / than
