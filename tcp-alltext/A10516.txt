                  PROV. 16. 31.
The hoarie head is a Crowne of glorie, if that
it be found in the way of righteousnesse.
            
            
               MAns life is but a iourney to the
graue,Via vita dicitur per quam quiliber natus properat ad finem, Basil. in Psal. 1. Exod. 12. 8. 11.
a way, a short way to death:
Infancy the way to childhood,
childhood to youth, youth to the
strongest age, that to olde age,
and old age the Thule, and ne plus
vltra of Nature,Baculus sustentatio est senectutis Chrysost. in Psal.

                  2. Ezek. 19. 7. Isai 36. 6. is the confines of Death. The old
man standeth like the Israelite departing from
Egypt, eating the Passeouer with sowre hearbs, and
his Staffe in his hand. Some leane on superstitious
vanities, their Staffe teacheth them, but to erre; others
to that Staffe of Reede, the World: which
confidence is an Egypt to Israel,Baculus intelligitur ae que ipsa lex, quae

glorie. These words containe this proposition, the
old age of a righteous man is honorable and blessed:
yet in a second view I see them,Gen. 2. like the riuer of
Paradise, diuiding themselues into foure heads.
            
                The first runneth towards the last part of mans
earthly pilgrimage, set downe heere vnder hoarie
haires, an effect or signe of Old Age.
            
            
                The second proposeth a reward to those which
arriue at this age of sorrow and care, A Crowne of
dignitie.

Iustice, beholding all our way, and accordingly rewarding
as it is found.
            
            
                The last pointeth out the only meanes to obtaine
that Crowne of glorie, an honourable old Age,
which is to be had in the way of righteousnesse.

                  l. 1. ho. 1. is our present lesson,
We must be old. There is a certaine course, and one
onely path of Nature, an headlong way of time,
wherein is no stay, but such easie passage, that
the Infant and lame old man runne with equall
pace to a more distant or neerer end. Mans state
was by creation immortall, but the day that sinne
was borne, man began to die: had he not sinned,
there should haue beene a comfortable maturitie
in age; and if our liues like some long kindled
lampes should haue consumed, it must haue beene
without all paine, sicknesse, want of strength, sense
or feare of death; for without sinne there could
haue beene no punishment: so that if we define old
age, a c

               rtaine ripenesse of life, and length of time
to a blessed translation, then age is naturall;Ipsa senectus est morbus. Membra torpent, praemoritur visus, auditus, incestus. Plin. l. 7. c. 50. Eccles. 12. De fide resur. c. 9. but if
we describe it according to our present being, it is
a continuall disease, the grounds and lees of life, in
which the bodie languisheth, one part forerunning
the rest toward the graue; in which the
keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men bow
themselues, the gri
                     •
                  ders cease, and they waxe darke
which looke out of the windowes: therefore I may say
of it as Ambrose of death; God gaue it not a principio,
sed pro remedio—non naturaest sed malitiae: 
               
                  〈◊〉
               
is no Child of Nature but Disobedience, and now
our liues decay is a remedie against the life of sinne,
that therefore in this senio mundi, do

the mercy of God, that our sinnes so quickly mature, should not liue too long, to greaten his iudgements.

               adeth, as it loseth the
blossomes of youth, it findeth a Crowne of dignitie,
abundance of dignitie, which euen like a crowne
compasseth euery part.
            This point well learned,Vse. would first, better nurture
those despisers of the aged, who haue learned
of the wicked children of Bethel,
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                to mocke the aged;
or (as if they had taken vp the inhumane custome

                  es, and Berbuces) with vnreuerent
vsage, to eare vp their aged Parents, whom God
commandeth them to honour.
            Secondly, it would comfort the aged, if they knew
the dignitie of their age, and that it is a Crowne of
glorie, which consisteth in the benefits and blessings
which God giueth them by their age, for their
age, and at the end of their age: of which I will
speake in order, if you will first consider with mee

these six things which seem to make old age vnhappy.
Some are troubled,Exod. 20. 12. Leuit 9. 32. Turpe est sapienu, cam habe
                     •
                  t anim

                     •
                   laudes ex corpore. for their beauties decay in
age; they may learne a worthy saying of a most vnworthy
Iulian: It is a shame for the wise to be ambitious
of his bodies praise, since hee hath a soule:
beautie is fading, a fraile good, vnworthy a wise
mans care in possessing, or sorrow in losing.
            Secondly, for that it is full of infirmities: but they
which so obiect, doe more properly blame the disease,
then age. To these I only say, if thou art good,
thine infirmities cannot make thee vnhappy.
            Thirdly, for that age like Delilah, cutteth off our
strength as we sleep in her lap;Plut. leauing old men like
Mercuries, which they painted without hands &
feete, vnapt for imployment: but it is neither
strength of old men, nor counsell of young which is
expected: happy state where yong mens armes, and
old mens counsel preuaile. When Soph
                     •
                  cles sonnes
before their time, enquired into their fathers yeres,
he repeated to the Iudges the verses he was making,
for which he was iudged able still to manage his affaires:
greatest a

much by strength as wisedome. But who so weake

               nnot serue God? Remember that thou art
subordinately borne for thy Countrey, thy friends,
thy selfe, but primarily for Gods seruice.
            Fourthly, because it 
                  〈◊〉
                pleasures: but since
we want to our opinion, onely what we desire; that
fault is not in age, but euill appe
                  •••
               e of things at least
not seasonable; and to reason, nothing is properly
wanting which is not numerable among things necessarily
good. Want of abundan
                  •
                riches, or youil

full pleasure, are improper, and abusiue speeches; for
one we should say, want of a mind not coueto
                  •
               s; for

                  •
               he other, want of temperance, though with some
diff
                  •
               rence: abundance may be more happily enioyed
then desired, (all may possesse, none may be co
               
                  •••
               ous)
but pleasures are for the most part more
happily desired then enioyed. For they like one Zoroastres,
laugh at their birth,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                but like all others borne
& dying, end with sorrow: pleasure is counsels foe,
reasons snare, and the wits tyrannicall master; it is
the deuils grand-factor, the baite to couer the hooks
of sinne; the sweete mortall poyson which drieth
the veines, and enfeebleth the sinewes of vertue: no
wonder if Marcus Curius wished his enemies giuen
to pleasure, he knew suchidefendants vnhappy, next
them against whom death fighteth with his double
armour, the Sword, and Famine. Happy age then
which taketh 
                  〈◊〉
                which would make vs
more vnhappy,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                which maketh vs lesse desirous of
that which wee should not desire: so many are the
mischiefes which this bewitching Siren conueieth
to the hart through the senses, that many may auow
that which Appius Clau
                     •
                  ius said (when he heard the
ouerthrow which Pyrrh

which seem to pron

hearers, I dare conclude, that the damned haue experience
hereof, it had bin better for them to haue bin
blind and deafe,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                then to haue their pleasures in this

                  〈◊〉
               , changed for eternall torments in hell.
            Fiftly, that which some obiect, the aged are froward,

petish, hasty, malicious, dispraising the present,
praising the ages past, selfe-opinioned, forgetfull,
and the like, is not our ages fault but ours: that it is
talkatiue, he well confessed and excused who said, I
thanke mine age which made me lesse intemperate
though more talkatiue: young men blame the aged
for speaking much when their owne eares itch to be
running out into their tongues, or when they heare
their iust reproofes: the speaker maketh discourses
long or short. I neuer heard a wiseman speake too
much, or a foole too little.
            Lastly, some therefore esteeme old age vnhappy,
because it is neere death: these may as iustly think al
the life wretched, of which no part is far from death:
and if this life be but a shadow of true life, then hee
that hath most to spend of an vncertaine life, is neerer

                  〈◊〉
                euill to be feared, then the aged, who as he is
in probability neerer death, so in truth is he neerer
the beginning of a true and eternall life.
            Opposite to these seeming euils, are sixe reall benefits,
whereof God giueth the first foure by our
age; the fift, for our age that is with man, the last at
the end of our age: and these are like sixe pretious
Iewels set in this crowne of glorie, dignifying a righteous
old man.
            The first is wisedome,Gloria senum est canities, 
                     •
                  d est 
                     〈◊〉
                  , Bed exp. in Sam c. 2. the beauty and vigor of the
mind. The ancient heathen pourtrayed out our ages
with the same colours and pensill, which now opinion
worketh with: making thē like Nebuchadnezzars
Image, an head of gold, breast of siluer, the last par
                  •
               
mixed with Iron & clay. But the word of God doth
otherwise describe, youth an age of errour and folly,
but old age the last golden part, a crown of dig
                  •
               ity.

Some may truly say, it is more easie and common to
be old then wise:Si sum Sophocles non delito, id
                     •
                  l
                     •
                  o non sum Sophocles. I must borrow his forme of speaking;
If Sophocles, no doter, if a doter, no Sophocles: if
any be this blessed old man, he is wise, if not wise, not
this righteous old man; as will appeare in the last
part. What thē if these wrincles are the monuments
of thy beauties ruine and decay? yet in those furrowes
experience hath sowed wisdome. The spring
is louely for hopes, but the autumne for fruits: the
glory of yong men is their strength,Prou. 20. 29. and the beauty of old
men is the gray head. There is beauty for beauty: but
as God hath giuen the flower of our life to adorne
our youth, otherwise full of deformities of mind, so
hath he giuen the fruit of wisedome, the late comlinesse
of mind to honor age,S
                     ••
                  a foecunditas. Ambr. l. 5.epist. 31. else full of infirmities:

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                age is the flowre of wisedome, or rather
wisdome is the fruit of age; as if God made this
age amends with greatest excellency of mind: not
to tell of the aged necessitie of aged experience, to
the happy being of a State, where like the contrarie
motions of the heauens, Rehoboams yong States-men
are to be moderated by the aged: nor of the miserie
of that Common weale, where Princes are children,
where those young Phaetons obtaine power, to set
the world on fire. I may easily say, it is the helme of
the minde, and age bringeth that maturitie which
maketh wisedome a skilfull Pilot, which in the
yong, at best is but in Theorie, in hope.
            The second is, age maketh vs abandon many noysome
affectiōs which loaded our youth, as the storm
forced Ionahs Mariners to cast their wares ouerboard:
when once we haue receiued the sentence of
death in our selues, we do without much difficultie,

cast off the care of vain delights. Barzillai (who liued

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . It is a world to see the vaine opinions of
some men, they would lay violent hands on vnconquered
nature, and be yong againe,Antis
                     •
                  . apud Laert lib. 7. so their age the
onely desired thing they hate: their desire of youth
in age is but a second childishnesse of the old; there
being nothing more vnreasonable, then to loathe
that state and age to which with wishes and feare of
failing we haue attained: and why? forsooth they
want those pleasures which attended their youth. It
is true, Sathan giueth the yong man pleasures freely:
but as the reuengefull Selymus bestowed these
farmes on his Ianizaries, that he might sequester thē
to the slaughter; which dangers the good mans
age teacheth him to loathe: which falling vpon the
delights of giddy youth like Pythagoras on the company
of drunkards,Dorion 
                     〈…〉
                  . lib gent. biddeth the Musitians change
the harmony, & sing a sadder note; at which becomming
sober, they cast off their garlands, and are ashamed
of their folly. Doest thou then blame thine
age for disburdening thy mind of eui
                  •
               s? Recount
thine age, number thine errors, and thou wilt bee ashamed
of that thou hast beene: as the starres vanish
at the fight of the Sunne, so do our foolish delights
at the rising and approach of true wisedome shewing
vs some light of the ioyes of heauen. Age taketh

not away, but changeth the delights, giuing true
for false; reall for seeming; blessed for dangerous,
pleasures: I will dismisse this age as Iacob his Asher,
with this blessing,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                it shall giue pleasures for a king: the
greatest and most solid delights.
            The third is a willingnes to die; for we die not all
at once, but part after part decaying, giueth vs an
easie passage. The old man departs as out of an Inne
the yong is pulled out of his house: the yong dieth
as fire quenched with water violently, the old man
like a lampe burnt out.
            The fourth is a neerer view of the most blessed estate
of heauen: doubtles God reserueth the greatest
comforts for this greatest triall: the neerer death
the more the righteous man is sensible of heauen:
therefore how euer in his trials, he be toffed betwixt
feare & hope, like Iacob at the report of his deare Iosephs
life,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                yet whē he seeth the charets ready to carry
him away, then his spirit reuiueth: as he said of his Bethel,
so may I of this last age, it is the gate of heauē, it

are foure benefits which God giues vs by age: the 5.

                or in respect of age, that is, honor amōg
men. As the law makes a diadem the signe of honor
& maiesty, so God by nature makes the hoary head
a crown of dignity. Therefore the Greeks do aptly
expresse age and honour by the like word they had
their Presbytery, the Magistracy so named of the Roman
Senate was so called of age:

a holy crown of life dignity. Thou wilt say, thou hast

not thine honor. Wonder not, thou liuest amongst
men,Quosiudices 
                     〈◊〉
                  . of whom God receiueth not what they owe.

honor the aged, but of the godly I may say as Lysander
of Sparta, It is the most honourable house for
age: they giue it the best entertainment.
            The last is the dignity which God giueth at the
end of a righteous age, a glorious and eternall life.

euen God, vnto whose eyes all things are open, shall
discouer it. Dauid well knew that God spyed out all
his pathes, and that if he enclined to any euill, the
Lo
                  •
               d would finde it out, who saw the secrets of the
heart. By three discoueries God manifesteth himself
a present beholder of all the wayes of man.
            First, more immediately smiting the conscience,

with a dreadfull apprehension of his presence: which
commeth as Iesus to Magdale
                     •
                  
                before present, but
after making his presence knowne; opening the eye
of the soule, awakening the conscience to behold
the eye of God looking on vs: which falling on the
heart like some dreadfull light from heauen, siniteth
downe some like Paul bound for Damascus, that hee
may raise them: openeth others eies and discouereth
the iudgement,Num. 22. 31. standing like the Angell before
Balaam in a narrow way with his sword drawne in
his hand: or like the fingers of an hand writing on
Belshazzars wall,Dan. 5. 5. 27. loosing his ioynts, and striking him
with a cold shaking at the sight of this sentence, thou
art weighed in the ballance, and FOVND too light. So
God found Iudas conscience, though a little while
he enioyed the price of blood, yet presently his conscience
is found,Mar. 27. and he confesseth I haue sinned in
betraying innocent blood. Cain was sicke of the same
disease, & whilst none pursued him, his conscience
told him, who euer found him would slay him. Whē
               Aristubolus had murdered his brother, and starued
his mother: his conscience was found, and
he could neuer get those bloody staines out of his
minde, till with extremitie of feare and griefe',Ioseph. lib. 1. de bell. Iud. c: 3. Sperandum certe non crat vt maximum deilumen facta 
                     〈…〉
                  
                his
bowels perishing he cast vp blood, which casually
throwne down where his brothers was not yet washed
out, to the amazement of the spectators drew
out this desperate confession of a wounded conscience:
There was no hope, I should conceale my wicked
deeds, frō the great light of God. Such is the violēce o
                  •
               
these E
                  •
               nas, fires of hel, by the breath of God set on
fire in the reprobates conscience, that he that hath

concealed it all his life, hath often beene compelled
at his death to vtter it to his shame. God heareth the
secret parly of the heart; hee heard Moses prayer vnspoken.
The tonglesse Creatures speake in his eares,
the voyce of Abels blood cried to God,Gen. 4. 10. the stones
cry out of the wall in the oppressors house. Hath
blood a voyce? can senslesse creatures speake? or
doeth this intimate God a present Seer of euery
action, in all more certainly informed then if the
Creatures could tell. Much more doeth he heare a
thousand witnesses crying in a sinners conscience,Origen. vocat signataspecatorum imagin
                     •
                  s.
in which all the world at the iudgement shall reade
the crimes written with a pen of Iron. Lucian wittily
feigned in his Menippus, that certaine shadowes attending
our bodies in this life, accused vs to the infernal
powers. Our conscience is that shadow which
(when the light of God hath found vs) wee cannot
outrunne. Euery one hath such a register, a witnes
a iudge, a seuere reuenger in his own bosome. Therfore
(saith Ambrose) if a man be alone, let him bee
more ashamed for his owne conscience,
                  Si quis solus est,

                and rather
stand in awe of himselfe present then a thousand others:
for all the world may be deceiued in thee, but
thy conscience will speake the truth.
            God findeth out good men in their errors, but as
the stranger yong Ioseph, to direct him in his way to
repentance: the sinner Luc. 7. long hid her workes of
darkenesse, yet being found she watred Christs feete
with teares. Peter denyed and forswore his Master:
but when Iesus looked backe, and found his conscience,
he went out and wept bitterly.
            The second discouery is by the word preached:

some thinke the word finds not the reprobate, but it
is euer mightie in operation,Hebr. 4. 12. sharper then a two
edged sword, and entreth through, euen vnto the diuiding
asunder of the soule; it is powerfull to harden
and conuict the conscience of the rebellious.
            
               Dauid heard the parable, but till God by the ministry
of Nathan commeth to a neerer application &
findeth him,2. San
                     •
                  . 12. he giueth sentence as on another man:
When the Iewes heard Peter, their hearts were pricked:
God had discouered their waies to them, then
they begin to conceiue a dreadfull presence of God,
and the miserable estate they were in. It is no wonder
though we haue for a time Adams thickets to run
into, strange Labyrinths and excuses to hide vs in,
so that the word findeth vs not, but when God will
finde vs: hee that being God and man did often find
the hearts of his hearers,Math. 8. Non ad verba sed ad animū respondet. often answered as to their
minds which spake, will by the same spirit direct the
prophesie to our consciences: and howeuer opinion,
securitie, or wandring thoughts haue bard vppe the
doores of our hearts, when God will enter to finde
vs, they shall flie open like the Prison doores before
the Angell.
            The third discouery of mans waies is by iudgement.
Ionah fled from God,Act 12. 10. sonah. 1. 3. and was embarked for
Tarshish, & when God found him hee confessed his
sin. Many yeeres Iosephs brethren hid their mischieuous
practise against poore Ioseph, but at the sight &
first appearance of affliction, they confesse, We haue
sinned against our brother,Gen. 42. 22. 
                     〈◊〉
                   44. 16. 
               in that we saw the anguish
of his soule when he besought vs, and we would no
                     •
                   heare
him: and again to Ioseph, God hath 
                     •
                  ound out the wickednes
of thy seruants.
            
            
               
               Achan had buried his theft,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                but who can hide from
God, who being in euerie place, leaueth none secure
for the wicked? God findeth him out by lot. Ahab
changed his apparell when he entred into the battell,
but God singled him out, the arrow found
him betwixt the ioynts of his armour. How often
doth God finde out the adul
                  •
               erer with shame and
pouertie? if perhaps he escape both these, yet rotrennesse
sendeth, 'as Ioab after Abner, and smiteth
him vnder the fifth ribbe: how euer hee hide,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                God
will finde him. I need not added to your experience
any relatiō of the discouery of murthers,1. Sam. 15. & oppressions,
the iniuries like Saules Amalekitish cattell, neuer
ceasing crying till the crime be found out. But how
euer God let the sinner goe in this life, his iudgements
shall finde him in that to come.
            This were enough to teach the sober minded to
keepe a good conscience,Vse. and to lay the word to
heart, and pull off the false visours of hypocrisie,
thou must not thinke to goe a way which God seeth
not: it is true, neither shall any thing bee found
which thou hast not done, (there is no cup in B
                     •
                  niamins
sacke) neither any thing hidde which thou
hast done: If thou doe well,Gen. 4. 7. shalt thou not be accepted?
Will hee not crowne thee? And if thou
doest not well, sinne lyeth at the doore. Sinne shall
hunt the wicked person to destruction: sinnes
like Acteons dogges, pursue their Masters to the
death. If 
                  •
               hou wert to deale with man, thou
mightst call thy temporizing in Religion policie,

comitie; thy lying, equiuocating; thy symonie,
gratitude; but none of these shifts and disguises wil
auaile thee: it is God which shall iudge thee according
to thy waies. There is but one path to heauen,
the way of righteousnesse in which the blessed are
found,Pars vl
                     •
                  . In the wa
                     •
                   of righteousnesse. Non de aetate sed de mente iudicium est, Origen. Non annorum canities est laudanda sed morum. Ambr. Perfecta aetas est vbi perfecta virtus, Ambr. orat. 
                     •
                  un. which is my last part. The old man is honorable:
but where shall I finde the man? there are
many of yeares, but few honorably old; they are not
gray haires and wrincles, which beget a reuerent esteeme
with man, much lesse the Crowne of glorie
with God. There is a young old man, as there are
some old young men: he a childe at an hundred
yeares, these old with few. Honor is due to the aged,
not to all, but to the righteous: to all other their
gray haires are the displayed banners of Gods iudgment,
a Crowne, but a Crowne of thornes; which
teacheth vs,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                that the onely way to an honorable and
comfortable old age, is an holy life: the promises
of a blessed age are to the righteous. And by the
Prophet he saith; There shall be no more a childe of
daies, nor an old man that hath not filled his daies; for
he that is an hundred yeeres old shall die as a yong man,
but the sinners being an hundred yeeres old shall be accursed.
And of Elies family, he saith; There should
not be an old man for euer: and to the wicked hee
threatneth a trembling heart, and a sorrowfull mind,

                     •
                   life hanging before them, feare both night and day,
without assurance of life. The vngodly shall not
liue out halfe his daies: therefore S. Peter saith, If
a man long after li
                  •
               e, and would faine see good
daies, let him refraine his tongue, eschew euill▪ and

doe good. There is no meanes to obtaine a comfortable
old age, but by this narrow way of righteousnesse.
            There are two waies;
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                the one rough, but straite;
the other easie, but like the rocke at Massada, a snaky
way full of turnings, and narrow in the end: in these
are contrarie leaders; the Deuill saith, as Abner to
Asahel, Turne thee either to the right hand or to the
left, God saith, Make straight steps vnto your feete:
there is but one short and strait line betwixt two limits:
And they who carrie the Arke of Gods Couenant
in their breasts, goe like the Philistims kine to
Bethshemesh, in one path, turning neither to the
right hand nor to the left: though continually expressing
fraile affections,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                of returning & deuiation.
            There are that blame their age as full of inconueniences;
but the 
                  •
               ruth is, it is onely sinne which maketh
them vnhappie. As Esau said of his brother,Gen. 27. 36. 38. so
may we of sinne, it tooke away our birth-right, and
it will also haue our blessing: was it not iustly called
a deceiuer? Esaus teares must be our tutors, hee
sought the blessing, but too late.
            There are many Arguments to perswade the old
man to this way of righteousnesse.
            First, let this haue the first place: all other comforts
in this winter of life are striken dumb: as Lamech

a carefull diet, that it may serue them in their age,
but it is a slender fortresse which will not hold out
the assault of few daies sicknesse: perhaps some are
so strong that they come to fourescore yeares; but
then nature commeth like an instant Credi

legs, our hands, our eies, part after part. Vertue onely
hath an immunity and groweth not lame with age.
            Some of the Cynicks opinion,Diog apud. Laert. l. 6. that there is nothing
more wretched, then a poore old man, leane only to
the deceitfull staffe of wealth: but righteousnesse is

riches are but like Elishaes staffe in Gehazies hand,2. King. 4. 29. 32. in

an afflicted mind for a time, the best of them being
as merrie company to bring vs before the Iudge,
by which the way may seeme shortned, but the
doome nothing lightned. In these or the like waies
there is a Crowne:Plut. but as Seleucus said of his, If any
knew the miseries which belonged to it, and how
heauy it is, he would not take it vp if he found it in
the way. Of all such I may say as Paul, They haue all
gone out of the way,
               Rom. 3. 12. 16. 17. 
               destruction and vnhappinesse are in
their way, and the way of peace haue they not knowen.
Many yeres once told, can no waies comfort a foolish
old age: but the conscience of a well spent life, is
an happy possession.
            Secondly, there is no other meanes to be honorable
before God and good men. It is true, the godlesse
Americans honour the Deuill, wicked men will
idoll the vngodly. For a time the rough garment
may couer the wickednesse of an old Prophet: perhaps
sinne may be folded vp in the large robes, and
in the large pleates of Magistracy: but then God
will at the last, if he find any such, brand them with
finall confusion: and howeuer they shined like glorious
lights (whilst feare and obseruance awed the
vulgar) yet they shall at last goe out, with an ill-sauouring
snuffe, and Death shall freely confesse what
they are, though life dissembled what they were.
Time is a slow speaker of the Great, but it will once
tell all.

                hee shall be but a
child of yeares, and God will make his old age most
despised.
            Thirdly, old mens evill examples are double sins.
As the Ephesians had three degrees in their presbytery:
the first were learners; the second, practisers;
the third, teachers; so are there in our ages; the last
must be a teaching age: to teach 
                  〈◊〉

it auaileth much, to see how old men liue; example

Princes, it hath an hundred tongues: D

Some thinke if they be rigid censurers of the
yong, it is enough; but see thou giue good example,
remember thouart old, & many yonger eies deriue
their libertie of sinning from thine intemperance.
            
               
Fourthly, there is nothing in the world more
wretched then a vicious old man: who in a diseased
bodie hath a more corrupted soule. The Heathen
said wel,

                We must not burden old age, alreadie ouer
loaden with miseries. Some men may say, Peccatum
reuixit, ego autem intery: the more they grow, the
more youthfull their sinne.1. T

dropsie of the soule, the disease of age, Couetousnesse
maketh an old man vnhappie, at euen burieth
him aliue in the earth: Sathan hath his variable
Porters to watch at the doores of this world;De d

                   &c. at
our comming in, he fetteth his faire sweete-singing
hand-maids, those are pleasures: at our going out,
standeth his eager long-fingered Groome, Couetousnesse,
to attend our age, which commeth (like
and enuious Philisti
                     •
                  , to Isaacs Well,) with his earth
to fill vp our hearts: you shall haue many men, how
carelesse soeuer they haue beene in their youth, yet
in their age their thoughts are fixed on the world,
as Archimedes on his Geometricall Tables;Plot. when
his seruants pulled him vp to eate, and had annointed
him, he pourtraied his workes vpon his oylie
bodie. Heare they, pray they, if you could open
their heart, you might see the picture of the world
sitting like Silenus Image in the broken stone:Plin l. 36. c. 5. De bell.

                     〈…〉
                  
                therefore,
though Couetousnesse be the roote of all euill,
yet it is like Iosephus Baaras, it is death to pull
it vp, it is rooted in the heart. All the best riches are
but a viaticum, enough is vsefull, too much a burden:
good men vse the world as if they vsed it not;
as Plinies Cranes about to flie ouer the Seas, take
vp stones in their feete, and sand in their throat, to

giue them weight against the winde, and as they
came neere the land, they by little and little, cast
them downe, so lightning themselues, that the desired
shoare seeth the last stone, not taken away,
but let fall; So the Children of God take vp the
care of riches to serue them in their life, but as they
come neerer their desired rest, they more and more
disburthen themselues. What old mens Couetousnesse
meaneth, I know not; why they should be so
carefull for this nothing, so nothing carefull for the
life to come, there is no reason. In the reserued
Manna of euery day there was a Worme, saue
onely that which was laied vp for the Sabbath:
that which thou laiest vp for the eternall rest, shall
not perish, what euer else thou storest vp shall bee
lost, and thou canst carrie nothing with thee. Saladin
would therefore haue his exequies thus solemnized:
a shirt fastned to the point of a lance, in
fashion of a banner, and a Priest going before, crying,
Saladin Conquer our of the East, of all the greatnesse
and riches he had in this life, carrieth not with
him after his death, any thing more then this shirt. If
there could be any excuse for the couetous, the yong
man had most rightto it. Couetousnesse is vaine in
any,2. King. 5. 26. but in the old it is most vnseasonable: as Elisha
said to Gebaza, Is this a time to take money, and to
receiue garments, and Olines, and vineyards, and sheep

with a dying hand? with one leg in the graue? what
more foolish then to take vp more prouision for the
iourney, by how much lesse thou hast to go? which
bringeth me vpon my next Motiue.

the Bridegroome will come: Sleepe not without

There is nothing more to be admired, then a wicked
old man, who being placed at the doore of
the world, neuer looketh out, albeit a thousand
forerunners continually cry, The Iudge is at the
doore.
            Seuenthly, the old man hath many remembrancers:

Eliah on Carmel; if we escape the first, the last bringeth
vs downe. The first relleth vs of Deaths ambushments:
the second, of the Sable flag displayed;

the third of the battle ioyned. Infirmitie seemeth to
instruct age the second childhood, bending him
downeward, as if it sayd, Man behold thy mother, into
whose bosome thou art returning for thy long rest.
But old age full of infirmitie, being the last scene of
our life, assureth vs we are neere death.
            Eightly, it is a marke of Gods children to be more
fruitfull in age:Pli. l. 16. c 27 Cursu opus e

abounding with fruit as more in yeares. It is a way
of righteousnesse, importing, we must not stand still
in it: our life is a course, and we must runne, and that
strenuously: like him which as he passeth, regardeth
not rayling, mocking, prayses, disprayses, wife, children,
friends, any thing which may hinder him, onely
he hastneth for the crowne. Some say, I haue been
zealous in my youth, then I fasted, prayed, heard,

of mercy against himselfe. How canst thou say, forgiue
me the sinnes of my youth, which committest
the same in age?
            Lastly, thou hast lesse excuse for thy sinne, for as
much as the sinnes of youth which carryed thee likeLu

repentance,Beatus qui sub ictu mor
