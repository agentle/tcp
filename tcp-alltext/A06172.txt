There came to my hands lately a litle (woulde God a wittye) pamphelet, baring a fayre face as though it were the scoole of a buse but being by me aduisedly wayed I fynd it the oftscome of imperfections, the writer fuller of wordes then iudgement, the matter certaiuely as ridiculus as serius. asuredly his mother witte wrought this wonder, the child to disprayse his father the dogg to byte his mayster for

his dainty morcell. but I se (with Seneca) y• the wrong is to be suffered, since he disprayseth, who by costome hath left to speake well. but I meane to be short: and teach the Maister what he knoweth not, partly that he may se his own follie, and partly that I may discharge my promise, both binde me. therefore I would wish the good scholmayster to ouer looke his abuses againe with me, so shall he see an ocean of inormities which begin in his first prinsiple in the disprayse of poetry. And first let me familiarly consider with this find faulte what the learned haue alwayes esteemed of poetrie. Seneca theughe a stoike would haue a poeticall sonne, and amongst the auncientest Homer was no les accompted then Humanus deus. what made Alexander I pray you esteme of him so much? why allotted he for his works so curious a closset? was ther no fitter vnter prop for his pillow thē a simple pamphelet? in all Darius cofers was there no Iewell so costly? forsoth my thinks these two (the one the father of Philosophers, the other the cheftaine of chiualrie) were both deceiued if all were as a Gosson would wish them, yf poets paynt naughte but palterie toyes in vearse, their studies tended to folishnesse,

and in all their indeuors they did naught els but agendo nihil agere. Lord howe Virgils poore gnatt pricketh him, and how Ouids fley byteth him, he can beare no bourde, he hath raysed vp a new sect of serius stoikes, that can abide naught but their owen shadowe, and alow nothing worthye, but what they conceaue. Did you neuer reade (my ouer wittie frend) that vnder the persons of beastes many abuses were dissiphered? haue you not reason to waye? that whatsoeuer ether Virgil did write of his gnatt, or Ouid of his fley: was all couertly to declare abuse? but you are (homo literatus) a man of the letter little sauoring of learning, your giddy brain made you leaue your thrift, and your abuses in London some part of your honestie. You say that Ports are subtil, if so, you haue learned that poynt of them, you can well glose on a trifleling text. but you haue dronke perhaps of Lethe, your gramer learning is out of your head, you forget your Accidence, you remēber not, that vnder the person of Aeneas in Virgil the practice of a dilligent captaine is discribed vnder y• shadow of byrds, beastes and trees, the follies of the world were disiphered, you know not, that the creation is signified in the Image

of Prometbeus, the fall of pryde in the person of Narcissus, these are toyes because they sa uor of wisedome which you want. Marke what Campanus sayth, Mira fabularum vanitas sed quae si introspiciantur videri possunt non vanoe. The vanitie of tales is wonderful, yet if we aduisedly looke into them they wil seme & proue wise, how wonderful are the pithie poemes of Cato? the curious comidies of Plautus? how brauely discouereth Terence our imperfectiō in his Eunuch? how neatly dissiphereth he Danus? how plea sauntly paynteth he out Gnatho? whom if we should seeke in our dayes, I suppose he would not be farr from your parson. But I see you woulde seeme to be that which you are not, and as the prouerb sayth Nodum in Cirpo quaerere: Poetes you say vse coullors to couer ther incouiences, and wittie sentences to burnish theyr bawdery, and you diuinite to couer your knauerye. But tell mee truth Gosson speakest thou as thou thinkest? what coelers findest thou in a Poete not to be admitted? are his speaches vnperfect? sanor they of inscience. I think if thou hast any shame thou canst not but like & approue thē, are ther gods displesant vnto thee? both Saturne in his maiesty moue thee? doth Iuno
               
with her riches displease thee? doth Minerua with her weapon discomfort thee? doth Apollo with his harping harme thee? thou mayst say nothing les then harme thee because they are not, and I thinke so to because thou knowest them not. For wot thou that in the person of Saturne our decaying yeares are signified, in the picture of angry Iuno, our affections are dissiphered, in yt person of Minerua is our vnderstāding signified, both in respect of warre, as policie. when they faine that Pallas was begotten of the braine of Iupiter their meaning is none other, but that al wisedome (as the learned say) is from aboue, and commeth from the father of Lights: in the portrature of Apollo all knowledge is denocated. so that, what so they wrot, it was to this purpose, in the way of pleasure to draw men to wisedome: for seing the world in those daies was vnperfect, yt was necessary that they like good Phisions: should so frame their potions, that they might be appliable to the quesie stomaks of their werish patients. but our studientes by your meanes haue made shipwrack of theyr labors, our schoolemaisters haue so offended that by your iudgement they shall subire pae nam capitis for teaching poetry, the vniuersitie is litle beholding to you, al their practices

in teaching are friuolus. Witt hath wrought that in you, that yeares and studie neuer setled in the heàds of our sagest doctors. No meruel though you disprayse poetrye, when you know not what it meanes. Erasmus will make that the path waye to to knowledge which you disprayse, and no meane fathers vouchsafe in their seriouse questions of deuinitie, to inserte poeticall sensures. I think if we shal wel ouerloke ye Philosophers, we shal find their iudgemēts not halfe perfect, Poetes you saye fayle in their fables, Philosophers in the verye secrets of Nature. Though Plato could wish the expulsion of Poetes from his well publiques, which he might doe with reason, yet the wisest had not all that same opinion, it had bene better for him to haue sercht more narowly what the soule was, for his difinition was verye friuolus, when he would make it naught els but Substantiam intelectu predictam. if you say that Poetes did labour about nothing, tell me (I besech you) what wonders wroughte those your dunce Doctors in ther reasons de ente et non ente? in theyr definition of no force, and les witt? how sweate they power soules in makinge more things then cold be? that I may vse

your owne phrase, did not they spende one candle by seeking another. Democritus, Epicurus, with ther scholler Metrodorus how labored they in finding out more worlds thē one? your Plato in midst of his presisnes wrought that absurdite that neuer may be redd in Poets, to make a yearthly creature to be are the person of the creator, and a corruptible substaunce, an incomprehensible God: for determining of the principall causes of all thinges, a made them naughte els but an Idea which if it be conferred wyth the truth, his sentence will sauour of Inscience. but I speake for Poetes, I answeare your abuse, therefore I will disproue, or disprayse naught, but wish you with the wise Plato, to disprayse that thing you offend not in. Seneca sayth that the studdie of Poets, is to make childrē ready to the vnderstanding of wisedom, and ye our auneients did teache artes Eleutberias. i. liberales, because the inst ructed childrē by the instrumēt of knowledg in time became homines liberi. i. Philosophye. it may be that in reding of poetry, it happe ned to you as it is with the Oyster, for she in her swimming receiueth no ayrs, and you in your reeding lesse instruction it is reported that the shepe of Enboia want ther gale,

and one the contrarye side that the beastes of Naxus haue distentum fel. Men hope that scollers should haue witt brought vpp in the Uniuersite, but your sweet selfe with the cattell of Enboia, since you left your College haue lost your learning. you disprayle Max iminns Tirius pollicey, and that thinge that that he wrott to manifest learned Poets me ning, you atribute to follye. O holy hedded man, why may not Iuno resemble the ayre? why not Alexander valour? why not Vlisses pollice? will you haue all for you owne tothe? must men write that you maye know theyr meaning? as though your wytt were to wrest all things? Alas simple Irus. begg at knowledge gate awhile, thou haste not wonne the mastery of learning. weane thy selfe to wisedome, and vse thy tallant in zeale not for enuie, abuse not thy knowledge in dispraysing that which is pereles: I shold blush from a player, to become an enuiouse preacher, if thou hadst zeale to preach, if for Sions sake thou coldst not holde thy tougue, thy true dealing were prayse worthy, thy reuolting woulde counsell me to reuerence thee. pittie weare it, that poetrye should be displaced, full little could we want Buchannans workes, and Boetius comfortes may

of a worthy warrior a poore poet, for a couragious Themistocles a silly Tirthetus, a man of great eloquence and singuler wytte, yet was he but a lame lymde captaine more fit for the coche then the field, the Lacedemonians trusting the Oracle, receued the cham pion, and fearing the gouernment of a stranger, made him ther Citizen. which once don and he obteining the Dukdome, he assended the theater, and ther very learnedly, wyshing them to forget theyr folly, and to thinke on victory they being acuate by his eloquēce waging battail won the fielde. Lo now you see that the framing of common welthes, & defence therof, proceedeth from poets, how dare you therfore open your mouth against them? how can you disprayse the preseruer of a countrye? you compare Homer to Methecus, cookes to Poetes, you shame your selfe in your vnreueren similituds, you may see your follyes verbum sapienti sat. where as Homar was an ancient poet, you disalow him, and accompte of those of lesser iudgement. Strabo calleth poetry, primam sapientiam. Cicero in his firste of hys Tusculans attributcth y• inuencion of philosophy, to poets. God keepe vs from a Plato that should expel such men. pittie were it that the

memory of these valiant victours should be hidden, which haue dyed in the behalfe of ther countryes: miserable were our state yf we wanted those worthy volumes of poetry could the learned beare the losse of Homer? or our younglings the wrytings of Mantuan? or you your volumes of historyes? beleue me yf you had wanted your Mysteries of nature, & your stately storyes, your booke would haue scarce bene fedde wyth matter. if therefore you will deale in things of wisdome, correct the abuse, honor the science, re newe your schoole, crye out ouer Hierusalem wyth the prophet, the woe that he pro nounced, wish the teacher to reforme hys lyfe, that his weake fcholler may proue the wyser, cry out against vnsaciable desyre in rich men, tel the house of Iacob theyr iniqui ties, lament with the Apostle the want of laborers in the Lords vineyards, cry out on those dume doggs that will not barke, wyll the mightye that they ouermayster not the poore, and put downe the beggers prowde heart by thy perswasions. Thunder oute wyth the Prophete Micha the mesage of the LORD, and wyth hym desyre the Iudges to heare thee, the Prynces of Iacob to hearken to thee, and those of

the house of Israell to vnderstande then tell them that they abhorre iudgement, and preuent equitie, that they iudge for rewardes, and that theyr priests teach for hyre, and the prophets thereof prophesie for money, and yet that they saye the Lorde is wyth them, and that no euil can befall them, breath out the sweete promises to the good, the cursses to the badde, tell them that a peeace muste needes haue a warre, and that God can rayse vp another Zenacharib, shew thē that Salamons kingdome was but for a season and that aduersitie cometh ere we espye it. these be the songes of Sion, these be those rebukes which you oughte to add to abuses recouer the body, for it is sore, the appedices thereof will easely be reformed, if that wear at a staye, but other matter call me and I must not staye vpon this onely, there is an easier task in hand for me, and that which if I may speak my conscience, fitteth my vain best, your second abuse Gosson, your second abuse your disprayses of Musik, which you vnaduisedly terme pyping: that is it wyll most byte you, what so is a ouerstay of life, is displesant to your person, musik may not stand in your presence, whereas all the lear ned Philosophers haue alwayes had it in

reuerence. Homar commendeth it highly, referring to the prayses of the Gods whiche Gosson accompteth folishnesse, looke vppon the harmonie of the Heauens? hange they not by Musike? doe not the Spheares moue? the primus motor gouerne. be not they inferiora corpora affected quadam sumpathia and agreement? howe can we measure the debilitie of the patient but by the disordered motion of the pulse? is not man worse accompted of when he is most out of time? is there any thinge that more affecteth the sence? doth there any pleasure more acuat our vnderstanding. can the wonders y• hath wroughte and which you your selfe confesse no more moue you? it fitteth well nowe that the learned haue sayd, musica requirit generosum animū

Plutarch your good Mayster may bare me witnes, that the ende whereto Musick was, will prooue it prayes worthy, O Lorde howe maketh it a man to remember heauenly things. to wō

can stay the souldiars sworde from slayinge an Orator, and shall not musike be magnified which not onely saueth the bodye but is a comfort to the soule? Dauid reioyseth singeth and prayseth the Lorde by the Harpe, the Simbale is not remoued from his sanc tuary, the Aungels syng gloria in excelsis. Surely the imagination in this present instant, calleth me to a deepe consideration of my God. looke for wonders where musike worketh, and wher harmonie is ther foloweth increcible delectation. the bowels of the earth yeld. where the instrument soundeth and Pluto cannot keepe Proserpina if Orphe us recorde. The Seas shall not swallowe Arion whilst he singeth, nether shall hee perish while he harpeth, a doleful tuner yf a di ing musition can moue a Monster of y• sea. to mourne. a Dolphin respectet a heauenlye recorde. call your selfe home therefore and reclayme thys follye, it is to foule to bee admitted, you may not mayntaine it. I hadd well hoped you woulde in all these thynges haue wiselye admytted the thyng, and disalowe naughte but the abuse, but I see your mynde in your wrytinge was to penn somewaht you knowe not what,

and to confyrme it I wot not howe, so that your selfe hath hatched vs an Egge yet so that it hath blest vs wyth a monsterus chickin, both wythoute hedde, and also tayle, lyke the Father, full of imperfection and lesse zeale. well marke yet a lyttle more, beare with me though I be bytter, my loue is neuer the lesse for that I haue learned of Tullye, that Nulla remedia tam faciunt dolorem quam quae sunt salutaria, the sharper medycine the better it cures, the more you see your follye, the sooner may you amende it. Are not the straines in Musike to tickle and delyght the eare? are not our warlike instruments to moue men to valor? You confesse they mooue vs, but yet they delight not our eares, I pray you whence grew that poynt of Phylosophy? it is more then euer my Mayster taught mee, that a thynge of sounde shoulde not delyghte the eare. belyke yee suppose that men are monsters, withoute eares, or else I thyake you wyll saye they heare with theire heeles, it may bee so, for indeede when wee are are delighted with Musike, it maketh our heart to scypp for ioye, and it maye bee perhaps by assending from the heele to the hygher partes, it may moue vs, good

policy in sooth, this was of your owne coyning your mother neuer taught it you, but I wyll not deale by reason of philosophye wyth you for that confound your sences, but I can asure you this one thinge, that this principle will make the wiser to mislike your inuention, it had bene a fitter iest for your howlet in your playe, then an ornamēt in your booke. but since you wrote of abuses we may licence you to lye a little, so y• abuse will be more manifest. lord with how goodly a cote haue you clothed your conceiptes, you abound in storyes but impertinent, they bewray your reeding but not your wisedom would God they had bin well aplyed. But now I must play the musitian right nolesse buggs now come in place but pauions and mesures, dumps & fancies & here growes a great question, what musick Homer vsed in curing y• diseased gretians, it was no dump you say, & so think I, for y• is not apliable to sick men, for it fauoreth Malancholie. I am sure, it was no mesure, for in those days they were not such good dāsers for soth thē what was it? if you require me. if you name me the instrumēt, I wyl tel you what was y• musik, mean while a gods name let vs both dout, y• it is no part of our saluation to know what it

was nor how it went? when I speak wyth Homer next you shall knowe his answere. But you can not be content to erre but you must maintain it to. Pithagoras you say alowes not that musik is decerned by eares, but hee wisheth vs to assend vnto the sky & marke that harmony. surely thys is but one doctors opinion (yet I dislike not of it) but to speake my conscience my thinkes musike best pleaseth me when I heare it, for otherwise the catter walling of Cats, were it not for harmonie: should more delight mine eies then the tunable voyces of men. but these things are not the chiefest poynts you shote at, thers somewhat els sticketh in your stomak God graunt it hurt you not, from the daunce you runn to the pype, from 7. to 3. which if I shoulde add I beleeue I coulde wrest out halfe a score incōueniences more out of your booke. our pleasant consortes do discomfort you much, and because you lyke not thereof, they arr discomendable, I haue heard it is good to take sure fotinge when we trauel vnknowen countryes, for when we wade aboue our shoe latchet Appelles wyll reprehende vs for coblers, if you had bene a father in musick and coulde haue decerned of tunes I would perhaps haue like

your opinion sumwhat where now I abhor it, if you wear a professor of that practise. I would quickly perswade you, that the adding of strings to our instrument make the sound more hermonious, and that the mixture of Musike maketh a better concent. but to preach to vns killfull is to perswad y• brut beastes, I wyl not stand long in thys point although the dignitye thereof require a volume, but howe learned men haue esteemed this heauenly gift, if you please to read you shall see. Socrates in hys old age will not disdain to learn y• science of Musik amōg child ren, he can abide their correctiōs to, so much accoūted he that, wt you contemn, so profitable thought he y•, wt you mislik. Solon wil esteme so much of y• knowledg of singing, y• he wil soner forget to dye thē to sing.

These therefore, these wer they that kept men in awe, these restrayned the vnbridled cominaltie, whervpon Horace wisely sayeth.

            Yea would God our realme could light vppon a Lucillius, then should the wicked bee poynted out from the good, a harlot woulde seeke no harbor at stage plais, lest she shold here her owne name growe in question: and the discourse of her honesty cause her to bee hated of the godly. as for you I am sure of this one thing, he would paint you in your players ornamēts, for they best becam you. But as these sharpe corrections were disanulde in Rome when they grewe to more licenciousnes: So I fear me if we shold prac tise it in our dayes, the same intertainmente would followe. But in ill reformed Rome what comedies now? a poets wit can correct, yet not offend. Philemon will mitigate the corrections of sinne, by reprouing them couertly in shadowes. Menandar dare not offend y• Senate openly, yet wants he not a parasite to touch them prinely. Terence wyl not report the abuse of harlots vnder there proper stile, but he can finely girde thē vnder the person of Thais. hee dare not openly tell the Rich of theyr couetousnesse and seuerity rewards their children, but he can controle
