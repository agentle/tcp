preached at the Tower of
London, by M. Dering
the xi. day of Decē

               Cum gratia & Priuilegio
Regiae Maiestatis per
Decennium.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
               John 6. 34.
               
                  Then they sayd vnto him, Lord
geue vs euermore of this bread.
And Jesus sayd vnto them. I
am the bread of lyfe: hee that
commeth vnto me shall not hū
                     ger,
and he that beleueth in me
shall neuer thirst.
               
            
            
               
                  WE haue (dearlye
beloued in our Lorde
& sauyour Christ) we
haue in this portion
of scripture to consider: First this
petitiō or request which ye Iewes
make vnto Christ in these words:
Lorde geue vs euermore of thys
bread. Then, the answere that our
Sauiour Christ maketh agayne?
I am the bread of life, &c. Theyr request
riseth of certayne wordes,
spoken immediatly before, where
Christ sayth: My Father geueth vnto

you from heauen the true bread.
For the bread of God is he that cō
                  meth
downe from heauen, and geueth
lyfe vnto the world. Through
whiche wordes they breake out
straight into this prayer: O Lord
geue vs alwayes this bread. These
wordes they doe not vtter wyth
any good affection, or longing desires
to be partakers of the mercies,
which are offered vnto all in
Christ Jesu: but rather of a distē
               pered
mynde, drawne into contrary
desires, seeking by all meanes
to fil themselues with happinesse,
and yet to jeste and scoffe at the
doctrine of Christ. The thoughtes
of them myndes are made manyfest,
both by these words of Christ:Joh. 6. 26.
               Ye seeke me because you eate of the
loaues and were filled: and also by
theyr owne wordes to the same
effecte,Joh. 6. 31. where they say: our fathers
did eate Manna in the wildernesse,
likewise requiring yt Christ would

so feede them still by miracle, and
then they would follow him. And
afterward also when Christ had
further taught them yt he woulde
in no such sort feede them deintelye
on earth, but if they would eate of
the bread that he would geue they
must renounce such fleshly concupiscence,
crucify themselues vnto
the worlde, and be with a liuelye
fayth incorporate into hys bodye,
then they shoulde eate of liuing
bread: as soone as they had heard
this, they murmured at him, shewing
yt he was not the bread that
they did seeke for, and then declared
what was theyr scoffing spirite,
and sayd openly:Joh. 6. 4. 
               Is not this
Jesus the sōne of Joseph, whose Father
and mother wee knowe? howe
came he down from heauen? Thus
dearely beloued, we learne what
mindes these men had yt would so
fayn haue bene fed with the bread
of lyfe. They would liue for euer 
                  •
               
               
but they woulde liue as they liste.Joh 6, 28
They would followe Christ: but
they woulde neyther hunger nor
thirst. They would do the will of
God: but they would not crucifie
theyr affectiōs. They would come
vnto heauen, but they would not
be led by Jesus the poor Carpenters
sonne. Theyr carnall fancies
beguyled them. Their scoffing at
Jesus Christ made their hartes so
blinde: and their desire of happines
was nothing but the shew of
their owne folye. Now let vs beware
by other mens harmes.Heb. 4. 11. Let
vs not fall after the same example
of disobedience. Yf we bring our
carnall fancies to the worde of
God,2 Cor. 2. 14. we shall neuer vnderstād it.
The naturall man perceyueth not
the things that are of God. Such
grose imaginations deceiued Nicodemus,Joh: 3, 4.
that he knew not what
it was to be borne a newe.John. 4, 15 Such
fancies made blinde the weoman

of Samaria, that she knew not
howe to aske for the water of lyfe.Mar, 16. 38.
Such carnal imaginations made
the children of Zebedie to aske of
our Sauyour Christe, they knew
not what.Luke. 18, 38. Yea all the disciples of
our sauyour Christ, by such fleshly
desires oftentymes vnderstoode
him not. And how muche more
ought we to take heede that haue
so barren hartes, not watered so
plētifully with gods sprite? Whether
shall we be led, yf wee bryng
vnto Gods word our sensuall appetites?
sure euē thether, whether
these Jewes are gone before vs,
to murmur agaynst Christe, and
despise his crosse. Let vs thē take
heede while it is yet tyme, and in
obedience of Gods worde banishe
farre from vs our own vnderstā
               ding,
and yf we will be taught of
the Lord God,2. Cor, 19. let vs leade into
captiuity all our own cogitations
and seeke no better estate for the

Gospell of God, then he hymselfe
hath appoynted by hys holy wisedome.
Otherwise it will surelye
come vpon vs, that came so long
agone vpon these carnall Iewes,
& wee shall haue so good liking of
our owne delight, yt we shall contemne
the poore Galilean, & with
a proude countenaunce wee shall
thinke much scorne, that the Carpenters
sonne should bee our mayster.
This is the fruyte yt groweth
out of mans wisedome. Here it is
plainely testified in this 6. of John.
It is testified in the Scribes and
Pharisies,Mat. 27. that so often scoffed at
our Sauiour Christ: in the Soldiours
that vppon the Crosse had
him in such derision: in the whole
multitude of the Iewes yt stroke
him and spitte on hym,Math. 26. 8. & bid hym
areade, who had hurt him. Thus
after that by carnall reason they
woulde needes iudge of Christe,
they grewe more & more in hardnes

of hart, till they thought it
good wisedome to speake so great
blasphemye. Such Gospellers
there were many in the primitiue
Churche, that thought themselues
wyse in makyng a ieste of Christ.
So Iulianus the Apostata when
ye Christians asked helpe agaynst
all theyr iniuryes with mockes
and scoffes hee woulde aske why
they did complayne,Math 5. 49. whē the Galilean
theyr mayster bad them doe
good for euyll: yf any would take
away theyr coate, that then they
shoulde geue him also their cloke.
So, many wicked Magistrates
spoyled the Christians of theyr
monye, and would taunt them
merelye with the saying of theyr
God:Prudence 
               Quod Caesaris scis, Caesari da,
geue that vnto Cesare that thou
knowest is Cesars. Such Gospellers
at this day, wee haue a great
many in Englād, yt laugh smothly
in their sleeues, at theyr madnes

(as they thinke) that followe so
earnestly y• Gospel.
                  
                     •
                  et. 44. So S. Peter
hath borne witnesse generally of
the wicked of all ages: that they
shall thinke it much madnes, that
other will not runne to like effusion
of riot: but let them alone yt
seeke willingly to goe so farre astray.
This is the time of their reioysing.
The daies of repentaunce
are not yet come. When they haue
done with their mocking, them
selues shalbe then mocked at, and
for all their pleasaunt sporting,
they shalbe called to Judgement.
            An other thing I noted vnto
you in ye petition of these Iewes,
& that was a desire of happinesse
which they wished to come vnto:
and in ye middes of their malice,
yet an inward sighing of spirite,
that they might once eate of the
bread of lyfe. They pleased them
selues exceedingly in fighting agaynst
Christ, and yet agayne in

remorse of conscience, they wished
to be partakers of eternall lyfe.
And this is that sparkeling of the
grace of god, which is kindled in
the harts of all men,John. 1. 9. of which S.
John sayth, that Christ lighteneth
all men that come into this worlde.
Cayne had this light,Gene, 4. 13. when the
burden of his sinne seemed so heauy
vnto him, that it could not be
pardoned.Gene, 27. 38. Esau had this light,
when for losse of his fathers blessing,
he lifted vp his voyce and
wepte. Pharaoh had this light,
when in remembraunce of all his
plagues he cried at the last:Exo. 9. 27. 
               The
Lord is righteous,
               Exo, 8, 19. 
               but I and my people
are wicked. The sorcerers of Egipt,
they had this light, whē God
confounded theyr wisedome in a
most vile creature, and they confessed
before Pharaoh: This is the
finger of God.
               Math. 2
                     •
                   24, Pilate had this light:
when he washed his handes, and
cried before all the Jewes, that he

was innocent from the bloude of
Christ.
               Act. 8. 13. Simon Magus had this
light when hee wondred at the
signes and miracles that were
wrought by ye Apostles, & would
haue geuen monye for the holye
Ghost.Math. 6. The Gentiles themselues,
they had all this light. Antiochus
when he wept for all the euill that
he had done at Jerusalem. Julianus
whē he cried, vicisti Galilaee, O
man of Galile, thou hast gottē the
victory. Adrian at his death, whē
he spake vnto himselfe, Animula vagula,
blandula, hospes comès
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   corporis,
quae nunc abibis in loca, n
                     ••
                   vt soles dabis
iocos, pallidula, rigida, nudula? Brutus
had this light, when the night
before he was slayne, he thought
he sawe a sprite that cryed thus
vnto him: Ego sum tuus malus genius
Brute: hodie me in Phillippis videbis,
But what neede I (dearely beloued)
to make this longe by examples,
You your selues (I am sure)

you can witnesse with this trueth.
There is none of you so far geuen
ouer to vncleanes, but I am sure
sometyme you say with these vncleane
Iewes: O Lord geue vs one
day the bread of lyfe. This is the triumph
that vertue hath our vice,
that whereso euer she is most hated,
there she is often wished for.
And this is the great punishment
that God bringeth vpon the wicked,
euen as the Poete sayde: Virtutem
vt videant, intabescant
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   relicta,
that though they loue not vertue,
nor can not like to follow her, yet
they should pyne away with a lō
               ging
desire after her. And this I
am sure it striketh deepe, & woundeth
the conscience of the wicked.
Though they haue set their harte
as an Adamant stone, and made
their face like stint, yet grace perseth
throughout their concupiscēce
& they say sometime, ye way of vertue
is better. There was neuer

so impure and disolute and adulterer,
but he hath said sometime: ye
chaste body is beste. There was
neuer so blasphemous nor vile a
swerer, but sometyme he hath trē
               bled
at Gods Maiestie.
                  
                     •
                  a
                     •
                  . 5. 2. There
was neuer man so proud and ambitious,
but sometyme he remembreth
he is but earth and ashes.
There was neuer such an vsurer,
nor couetous wretch, but sometime
he thinketh his Gold & siluer
shall canker, & the ruste of it shall
be a witnesse agaynst him. There
was neuer so riotous a person,
sumptuous & prodigall, but sometyme
he condemneth hys owne
doing,Psal. 37, 12 and sayth with the Prophet:
The vnrighteous man boroweth
and payeth not agayne. And
what should I say more? There
was neuer so high minded nor
vayneglorious a king, but hee
hath sōtyme thought his crowne
would fall from his head, and the

crowne of righteousnes was better,
which was in the kingdome
of Heauen. And this dearely beloued,
as it is in a wicked lyfe, so
likewise it is in corrupt religion.
Truth that is strongest and ouercommeth
all, in Religion forceth
the enemy oftentymes to confesse
her. There was neuer papist that
so magnified merites, and talked
of his workes of supererogation,
but oftentymes in his cōscience he
would surely confesse,Luc. 17, 16. 
               that when
he had done all, yet he was vnprofitable.
There was neuer any so
great an enemy to fayth, but whē
his conscience was touched with
the greife of sinne, he would cry a
loude: Fayth alone doth iustifie.
There was neuer (I am sure) papist
yet so dronken, that made so
much of all his fleshlye worshippinges,
of Organes, and singing,
of altares and altareclothes, of
francomesence and sweet 
                  〈◊◊〉
               
               
sauours: of banners & streamers:
of goodlye tunes and melody:Esa. 1. 12.
of siluer crosses and chalices,Joh. 4. 23.
but he hath sayd sometime, who
required these things at our hands?
the true worshippers do worship in
spirite & veritie. There was neuer
Papist in so deepe a sleepe of pardons
and of purgatory, but hee
hath surely sayd it, such weake engines
can breake downe but paper
walles, and such could water
can quench but paynted fyres.
There was neuer Pope nor generall
counsell so desperately bent
to set vp worshipping of Images,
but theyr owne hartes haue often
cryed within them: they haue
mouthes and speake not,
               Psal. 115. 5 
               they haue
eyes and see not, they haue eares &
heare not, they haue noses and smel
not, they haue handes and touche
not, they haue feete and walke not:
thou shalt not bow downe to them,
nor worshyp them. There was neuer

Papist so blinded wyth the
great absurditie of transubstantiation,
but some tyme seyng the
wyne in the chalice, he hath bene
afrayde to say: by this and by nothing
els, let my sinnes be washed
and seing the cake in the Priestes
handes: thou alone hast redemed
me, and alone by thee I looke to
be saued. This doubt ye not (dearly
beloued) is the working of the
Lord in the hartes of all his enemyes.
Refuse hym how ye wyll
in lyfe or in Religion, you shall
cary day and night a witnesse in
your brest agaynst your selues, &
your hartes will condemne you,
that cry euermore agaynst you: yt
way vnto true happines is neyther
by sinne nor superstition: neither
by open rebellion, nor yet by
accursed idolatry. And thus farre
out of this petition of ye frowarde
Iewes I haue noted vnto you,
what I haue thought best for our

common instruction. The Lorde
graunt vs that we make the like
request, but with a better spyrite
and pray euermore vnto hym: O
Lorde geue vs alwayes the bread of
life.
               Joh. 6. 34. Now let vs consider the other
part which (I sayd) is ye an̄swere
of our Sauyour Christe. in these
wordes: I am the bread of lyfe, he
that commeth vnto me shall neuer
hunger,
               John. 6. 35 
               and he that beleueth in me
shall neuer thirst. Out of this place
(dearly beloued) I will note vnto
you, as the text geueth me occasion,
these three poynts. First who
is the bread of lyfe, then by what
meanes he is eaten, and thyrdly,
what fruite commeth of such sustenaunce.
Who is thys breade,
Christe sheweth in these wordes:
I am the bread of lyfe. By what
meanes he is eaten, it is shewed
in these wordes: He that commeth
vnto me, he that beleeueth in mee.
What fruyte commeth of it, it is

shewed in these wordes: he shall
neuer hunger, he shall neuer thyrst.
I am the bread of lyfe. These words
they signifie thus much, that in
Christe alone we haue life, and all
confidence of saluation must bee
grounded on hym & on none els.
Christ crucifyed is a continuall sacrifice
of reconciliation standyng
betweene God & vs, so that what
so euer grace, mercy, and peace is
poured vpon vs by God the Father,
it commeth downe through
the body of Christ vpon the crosse:
and what soeuer ioy or comforte
we can haue in beyng vesseles of
mercye, thus it is made perfecte:
whē with a liuely fayth wee looke
through Christ crucified, and so go
with boldnesse vnto the throne of
grace. Thus Christ is called the
bread of lyfe: the foode of our soule
& nourisher vp of our consciences
to a perpetuall quietnes. This the
scriptures testyfy most plentifully

in all places witnessing, that
when soeuer wee feele our selues
hungrye,Math. 11. 28. that is, laboring & heauy
lodē with the burden of our sinnes,
we must come vnto Christe: and he
will refresh vs. Frō our first father
Adam vntil the last man that shal
be borne vpon earth, neuer was
nor shall be one yt shall finde other
foode of life. Adam by whose sinne
we were all condemned, when hee
was cast out of Paradise, that is,
out of Gods fauour and the place
of rest, he could not feede his soule
neither with the labour of hys
hand, nor with the sweate of
his browes, but the first foode of
life he found in this promise, that
the seede of the Woman shoulde
tread down the head of the serpent.
               Gene. 3. 15.
Abraham, Isaak, and Iacob, in al
theyr wandryng iorneyes, they
liued not by this, that theyr posteritie
should be multiplied, and enioy
a land that flowed with milke &

hony, but this was the breade of
lyfe that made theyr harte glad,
euen the sight of Christe, and by
thys promyse euery one of them
liued:Gene. 12. 3 and 26. 4. and 28. 14. 
               In thy seede all the nations
of the earth shalbe blessed. The
law that came after and taught
vs true obedience,Rom. 7. 7. we learned nothing
by it,Rom 5. 20 
               but the knowledge of
our sinne, nor it wrought nothyng
in vs but the multiplying of our iniquitie.
The lawes and ordinaunces,Heb. 9. 9.
which were in meates and
drinkes,Heb. 10. 4. aud carnall rites and ceremonies,
they could not feede the
conscience of him that did the seruice:
the sacrifices and offeringes
were not such yt they coulde geue
vnto vs the foode of lyfe:Gal. 3. 24. 
               It was al:
together vnpossible, that the bloud
of Bulles and Goates shoulde take
away sinnes, but so farre the law did
feede our soules, as it shutte vs vp in
the faith that should be reueled, and
led vs as a scholemaster vnto Christ
               
The Prophetes that came after,
raysed vp of God to teach his people,
they shewed no other marke
to looke on, nor other hope to liue
by, but that child that shoulde bee
borne vnto them, and that sonne
that should be geuen them,
               Esa. 9, 6 
               whose
name was wonderfull, coūseler, the
mighty God, the euerlasting Father
the Prince of peace.
               Ephe, 4, 11 The Apostles
& Euangelistes now sent in these
latter dayes for the worke of the
ministery, to gather together the
saintes, and buyld vp the bodye of
Christ, they feede vs not with the
foode of our owne workes or
weldoing, but to make our fayth
strong, & the promise of God sure,
they tell vs: Christ is our peace, and
there is no other name vnder Heauen
geuen vnto men,
               Rom, 4. 16 
               by which wee
shall liue,
               Ephe. 2. 14 
               saue onely the name of Iesus
Christ.
               Act. 4. 22 Thus Christe is our
bread of lyfe, and if we will builde
our selues vpon Abraham, Isaak,

or Jacob, to be of theyr posterity
if we will be led by the lawe and
the Prophetes, by the Apostles &
Euangelistes, to finde the foode of
life: if we heare Christ himselfe, or
wilbe his disciples, thē this is our
Religion: Christ is the bread of life,
to to wretched haue the preachers
bene yt haue called you from this
bread, to feed you with theyr corrupt
leauen, from this fountayne
and welspring, to theyr owne puddles
that can hold no water. Thus
they haue all done that haue ledde
you any whether sauing to Christe
alone, yt haue taught you to praye
vnto sayntes, aungels, or archangeles,
to be your mediatours, that
haue tolde you of iustification in
your owne workes, that haue sold
vnto you their Masses as sacrifices
propitiatory for the quicke and
dead, that haue bid you truste in
pardons and indulgences for remission
of sinnes, yt haue broughte

you vnto the Pope, a sicke head of
an ill disposed sinagoge, to hange
your fayth vppon his sleaue, that
hath told you of generall Coūcels,
they coulde not erre, but what
so euer they shoulde decree, you
shoulde so receaue it, as the holy
Euāgelists. Thus haue these mō
               sters
spoken, and thus they haue
deluded you, and yet they say still:
wherein haue we offended? but
the Lord be praysed, that hath deliuered
vs out of the kingdome of
such darknesse, and brought vs againe
into the light of hys Gospel.
Let vs nowe walke in it accordingly,
and confesse Christe alone
to be the bread of lyfe. The second
thing that I noted vnto you in
this aunsweare of our Sauyour
Christ, is: how we do eate of this
bread, & that (I said) was shewed
in these wordes, he that commeth
vnto me, he that beleeueth in mee.
To come vnto Christ, to beleue in

Christ, this is to eat Christ, so that
we may wel say as S. August.
               August. tract 25 said:
Quid paras dentes aut ventrem, crede
& manducasti?
               Upon the 
                     〈◊〉
                   of John. 
               It is no neede to prepare
tooth or belly, beleue and thou hast eaten.
But here (dearlye beloued) I
must first admonish you that thys
place, nor this vi. Chapter of John.
is not ment of the Sacrament, as
some popish interpreters haue ignorātly
told you. The Sacramēt
was not yet instituted, nor any
nowe present knewe whether hee
would euer ordaine any such Sacramēt
of his body & bloud, or no:
So that yf he had spoken thereof,
he had tolde them that, whiche
they coulde not vnderstand. But
this Christ doth, without all consideration
eyther of Sacrament
or no Sacramēt. He telleth them
how and by what meanes his body
can be eaten, whether it be in
your inward fayth, when secretly
and with your selfe you feede vppon

his body, or whether it be in
outward signe or Sacramente,
which is a helpe of our infirmity,
the more liuelye to tast of his mercies.
There is but one & the same
way, neyther to eate his flesh, nor
to drinke his bloude: the whiche
way playnely & expressely here is
deliuered vs by Christe, that wee
neede not to erre except wee will.
And this was Christs great mercy
to prepare the harts of his children,
that they shoulde not bee offended
with any manner of vnderstandyng,
when they should
heare in the institution of the sacrament,
take, eate, this is my body.
They are before well instructed,
and they knowe what to beleeue.
The grosse and carnall fancyes of
transubstantiation, coulde not
disquiete them. They knew there
was no way to eate Christe, but to
come vnto hym, nor to drinke his
bloud, but to beleeue in him. And

thus fayth was ye more precyous,
the further of his bodely presence
was remoued from them,Heb, 13. 
               They
knew faith was the taking hold and
substaunce of things we hoped for,
and the sure apprehension & profe
of thinges that were not seene. So
that they knewe howe to feede of
hys bodye with great boldnesse to
lift vp theyr soule, and take holde
of his mercy that sitteth in heauen
at the right hande of hys Father.
Whence vndoubtedly all the merites
of his passion doe presentlye
flow vpon hys poore children. His
conflictes and agonies with sinne
and condemnation, to set vs free
from Gods wrath & displeasure,
and all his obedience shewed here
in flesh, from his corporall, reall,
and substantiall bodye, commeth
downe vpon vs, to cloth vs wyth
righteousnesse, that wee may bee
found vnblamable before hys father.
Thns much y• disciples well

vnderstoode, and they murmured
not at these wordes, this is my
body. Thus muche let vs learne
out of this place against we come
vnto the sacrament, that to come
vnto Christ & to beleeue in Christ,
that is truely to eate Christ. Thys
beyng proued true vnto you, you
well soone set your selues free frō
all popish idolatry. And how true
it is, marke well, I beseech you,
what are the wordes. I am sayth
Christ, the bread of lyfe. He that cō
                  meth
vnto me shall not hunger. Yf
Christe had spoken still properly,
accordyng to ye metaphore, he had
sayd thus: I am the bread of lyfe,
he that eateth me, shall not hunger.
Now he himself hath said: he
that commeth, in stead of this, he
that eateth, if you will beleue him
you must needes confesse it. To
eate Christe, is to come vnto him.
So in this other sentence. He that
beleueth in me, shall not thyrst. If

he had kepte ye property of speach,
he had sayd thus: he that drinketh
of me shall not thyrst. In stead of,
drinketh, he sayth, beleeueth, and
therefore it is moste certayne, to
drinke of Christe, is to beleeue in
Christe. So that this is now an
vndoubted truth, to eate Christe,
to drinke Christe, to come vnto
Christe, to beleue in Christ, these
are all one. And who hath eares
to heare and heareth not this? or
whose iudgement is so blind that
he can not perceyue it?John. 5 
                     •
                  ; Compare
the sayings of Christ in this chapter:
you can not (if you wil not) be
deceyued. He that beleeueth in mee
hath euerlasting life. And after. He
that eateth of this bread, hath euerlasting
life. Exceptye eate the flesh
of the sonne of man, and drinke his
bloud, you haue no lyfe in you. He
that beleueth on him that sent mee,
               John. 
                     ••
                  
               
               hath lyfe euerlasting.
               Joh. 
                     ••
                  
                
               You will not
come vnto me that you may lyue.
               
Who seeth it not here, to eate,
to come, to beleeue, is all one,
Againe: He that beleeueth in me, I
will rayse him at the last day. And
he that eateth my flesh, & drinketh
my bloud,
               Joh, 6. 54. 
               I will rayse him vp at the
last day. After all those sayinges of
eating his flesh in deede, and drinking
his bloud in deede, at which
the Capharnaites were offended,
& diuerse of his disciples forsooke
him, Christe sayth then vnto hys
Apostles, will you also go away? As
if he should haue sayde, are these
wordes so strange that you also
will be driuen a way? Unto which
Peter aunswered: Lorde to whom
shall we go, thou hast the wordes of
eternall lyfe, & we beleue and know,
that thou art Christ the sonne of the
liuing Lord. Loe here, how Saint
Peter himselfe, of whose name the
Pope braggeth so much, and yet
vtterly renounceth hys fayth. S.
Peter (I say) vnderstandeth, all

these wordes of life, of the eating
and drinking of Christes flesh and
hys bloud, he expoundeth them
thus: to beleue in Christe, and to
knowe him to bee the sonne of the
liuing God, euen as Christ hym
selfe had before taught hym: The
wordes that I speake are spirite aad
life, it is the spirite that quickeneth,
the flesh profiteth nothyng. If all
this be not playne enough, looke
yet, & let S. John expound hym
selfe. Here Christ sayth: he that
eateth my fleshe, and drinketh my
bloud dwelleth in me, and I in hym.
The same S. John that wrote
this,1. Joh. 4, 15, sayth thus agayne: Who so
confesseth that Iesus is the sonne of
God, God dwelleth in him, and hee
in God. Wherby it is playne, he
that confesseth thus of Christ, he
eateth his fleshe and drinketh hys
bloud. This (dearely beloued) is
no newe doctrine but taught by
Christe, receiued by his Apostles,

written for all ages by hys holy
Euangelistes, now preached to ye
comfort of all true Christiās, and
in the primitiue Church beleeued
of all the holy Fathers. I would
alledge you theyr owne sayinges
but that the tyme passeth, & you
haue thē plentifully set out vnto
you, you may reade them when
you will. These places alledged
out of the Scriptures, one expoū
               dyng
an other, they are the surest
witnesses, to know the meaning
of the holy Ghost. And what if
here I should reason out of our
Christes owne wordes to proue,
there can bee no transubstantiation.
He sayth for proofe, that hys
naturall body is rysen. See my
handes and my feete, touch me and
handle me,
               Luke 24. 33. 
               it is euen I. Seyng
Christe will haue our senses to
iudg of his body, let vs do so. See
feele, touch, tast, is it ought but
bread? this argumēt me thinketh

is good and well warranted by
Christ him selfe, and it semeth not
so onely to me, but S. Augustine
thought so nowe eleuen hundred
yeare agon. See, De doctrina Christian.
lib. 3. cap. 16. & there yon shall
finde it. But the tyme passeth, and
I will come vnto that, that I
thynke you looke for, and whych
the Pope hath made the substance
of all his masses. Christ saith thus:
Take,
               Math. 26. 26. 
               eate, this is my body. And
what then? is there any obscuritye
in these wordes? Is it not often
and playnely spoken, what it is to
eate is body? are not his disciples
well taught? knew they it not lōg
before? As it is playnely said: this is
my body, so is it not playnely expounded,
these wordes are spirite
and lyfe?
               Joh. 6. 14 No man can here be offended,
but he that is dull of hearyng,
and hath not harkened before
to the wholesome doctrine of
truth. But you will say, why could

not Christ as well haue sayd: this
is a figure, or signe, or token of my
body. I aunswere. Fyrste these
wordes are without daūger, that
his disciples should dream of trā
               substātiation:
they are so assuredly
taught before how they should
eate or drinke Christ. Then I say,
thys our sauiour Christ did choose
to speake, to shew his great and
aboundaut loue to warde vs, that
wee should be so fully perswaded
that he were our head, & wee his
members, as if hys naturall and
reall body, were substantiallye
within vs, that we should know,
what so euer we could wish from
his mercy to comfort vs, by this
Sacrament or couenaunte of his
mercy wee shoulde so assure our
selues of it, as yf we eate his very
flesh, or drinke his natural bloud.
The like phrases or speaches are
plaine and often in the scripture,Eph. 5. 24
               Christ is our head, and we his members

hee dwelleth in vs and wee in
him. He is the corner stone, & wee
are the building vp.Ephe. 2. 
                     •
                  . 
               Hee the vine,
and we the braunches.John. 1
                     〈…〉
                  ; His body
is the meate aud wee the eaters.
Whose harte is so dull that is not
stirred vp with these speaches? or
who vnderstandeth not by these
speaches yt Christ would shew the
aboūdance of his loue toward vs,
and the great boldnes that Christ
will haue vs to put in his mercy?
As for transubstantiation, it is so
straunge from the sence of the scripture,
that yf the Pope had not
bene, I thinke it neuer had bene
thought of. And yf the Councell of
Lateranne had not bene, it had neuer
bene named. But let vs way
the wordes a litle, and conferre
thē with these late popish follies.
Christ sayth,Math. 26. 
               take, eate, thys ys my
bodye. But the Pope sayth, take
not, eate not, site a farre of, and
tooke on, fall downe and worship.

This is my body. Was not this
theyr manner of preaching? How
els could this haue bine your mā
               ner
of practise, when you came to
the Sacrament, or as you rather
called it, the sacringe of your
Masse? Christ sayth: Drink you al
of this:
               Math. 26. 
               this is my bloud. The Pope
vtterly denieth it, & proueth it by
good reason. His body (sayth he)
cānot be with his bloud: there is
concomitantia, the one followeth
the other, and therefore you shal
not drinke it, yet it is his bloud.
Christ sayth,
               Cor. 11. 
               as ofte as you doe this,
preach forth the death of the Lorde
vntill he come. The Pope sayth,
that is not necessary. If you
say Masse dayly, it skilleth litle,
though you preache not once in a
yeare. What maner of vicar call
you this man, that dispenseth his
masters doctrin thus deceitfully?
or what hope can you haue of trā
               substātiation,
whē it hāgeth vpon

his credit, ye dealeth thus vnfaithfullie?
O (dearely beloued) be not
deceiued. These thinges bee to
playne to be dissembled. It is his
owne mouth that speaketh these
thinges, which (sayth he) can not
erre. Wee know that there is no
truth in hym, and whatsoeuer hee
doth, it is against Christ, and his
eternall Gospell. For the wordes,
thys is my body (I trust) I haue
proued it, they be not wordes of
errour, to make you beleeue the
thing that is not: the meaning is
plaine. The bread is a warrant, &
pledge vnto you, that as sure as
you eate it, which is the signe? so
sure your fayth feedeth on all the
fruytes of his Passion, and the
righteousnesse and true holines of
his humaine bodye couereth all
your sinnes before God his Father,
and clotheth you roūd about
with ioy and gladnes. These are
the riches of Gods aboundant

graces, which make the poore penitent
sinner to seeme more glorious,
then all ye worldly treasure.
This is the secret Manna with
which God fedeth his elect, yt maketh
the hungrie hart more glad &
joyfull, then all the bread of Princes.
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
               
These riches they haue spoyled
you of, that haue sold vnto you
so deare theyr transubstantiation.
This foode they haue taken from
you, yt haue fed you so long with a
fancie of Christes naturall body.
For the wordes, this is my body,
are not straunge.
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                Such phrases in
ye scripture are euer vsed vpon like
occasiō. In ye 33 chapter of Gene.
Iacob calleth his altar the mightye
God of Israell:
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                   24. yet ye altar was not
God, but set vp in memory howe
mightely God had preserued him.
In the 12. of Exod. God sayd to
Moses of ye Pascall Lābe. This is
the Lordes passouer, & yet it was
not the passeouer,
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   12, 1. but the sacrifice

of the Lordes passouer, when in
killing the first borne in the lande
of Egypte, he passed ouer the houses
of the children of Israell. In
y• 7. chapter of Leuitieus, where
God geueth to Aaron, ye shoulder
and brest of the sacrifices for hys
portion,Leuit 7. 3. he sayth thus: this is the
annoynting of Aaron, yet the breste
and shoulder of the beastes, were
not the oyle wherewith Aaron was
annoynted, but a signe or token of
his annoynting. In the 6. of Numery,
when God setteth forth the
law of the Nazarites, he forbiddeth
them to defile them selues at
the death of theyr father, mother
brother, sister, & added this clause:
Because the consecratiō of his God
is vpon his head.
               Num. 6. Yet the heare vppon
his head was not his consecration,
but the signe of his consecration.
In the 5, of Numery,
where God setteth forth the law
of gelousie, the water whereby the

woman is tried,
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      5. 11 is called often the
cursed water, and yet the water
was not cursed, but shewed the
woman to be accursed & detestable.
In the 19. of Deuteronomye,
speaking of a false witnesse, bothe
parties are bid to stand before the
Lord.
               
                  
                     •
                  ut. 19 Yet he meaneth before the
Priest, in whose brest was Urim
and Thummin, a liuelye representation
of the Lord. In the 26.
of Deuteronomye, teaching what
they shall doe that offer theyr first
fruytes,
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   26. 5. it is written: Thou shalt
say this before the Lord: Yet he
meaneth before the altar, a present
signe of the Lord.
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   31. 11. 
                     〈…〉
                  2 Oftentymes in
the law, the Arke is called the Lord
God. Yet the Arke was not God
but a liuely representation of the
Lord God. In the 17. of Genesis,
God speaketh of circūcision: this
is my couenaunt:
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                   17 
                     〈◊〉
                   11. Which yet God
him selfe expoundeth in the verse
following, this is the token of my

couenaunt. And what can be more
plaine thē this? so S. Paule saith:
the rocke was Christ.
               1, Cor. 19. 3. Yet Christ
was not the rocke that was in
Horeb: but the water of the rocke
was the signe of Christes bloud,
which quencheth the thirst of all
his elect and chosē. So S. Paul
calleth Baptisme,Tit. 3. 5. 
               Lauacrū regenerationis,
the washing of the new byrth:
               
yet ye water doth not regenerate
but the holy Ghost. An hundreth
such speaches you haue in the scripture,
where the signe hath the
name of the thyng signified. And
how are you so bewitched, that in
this one Sacrament of the body
and bloud of Christ, you can not
beare yt phrase which is so vsual
in the scriptures? But so it is, S.
Paules prayer hath taken effect
in the Popish kingdome: he that is
ignoraunt,
               1. Cor. 14. 38. 
               let him be ignorant still.
But I hope (dearly beloued) better
of you. God I trust hath lightned

you, and you doe vnderstand
his holy scriptures. You wil come
inspirite and trueth to these holy
misteries, and you haue forsaken
your olde leauen of al Romish Idolatry.
Now a woord or two of
the fruite of eating and drinking
Christ, & so I will make an ende.
To eate and drink Christ, is as I
haue sayd, to come vnto Christ, to
beleeue in Christ, and the fruit of
this is: he that commeth vnto him,
he shall not hunger. Againe, and he
that beleueth in him, shall not thirst
any more. This (dearly beloued)
is that great fruyt, that vnspeaable
benefite, yt endlesse mercye,
which they taste and eate of that
laboure and are loden and come
vnto Christ: My tounge can not
expresse it: your eares cānot heare
it: our hartes can not imagine it,
what is ye fulnes of ioy that springeth
out of this foūtain. To thirst
no more, to be no more an hungred,

is to see God as he is and
to contemne the world, to haue al
teares wiped away frō our eyes,
and be no more sorowful, to haue
the glory of God to shine vppon
vs, & no more to regard the light
of Sun or Moone. This shalbe
then perfect, when Christ shal appeare
in glory and maiestie, and
wee shalbe clothed with righteousnes
and immortality. Now in
this body of sinne, this happines
is tasted of, when we feele the spirite
of adoption to crie vnto our
spirite,Gala. 4. 6 
               Abba Father. When the
mercies of Jesus Christ do so cō
               passe
the inner man, that we see
& feele the kingdome of Heauen
pictured in our consciences, when
with a great and longing desire,
euen as the hart longeth after the
water brookes,
               Psal. 12. 51 we cry with saint
Paule:Phil. 1. 21. 
               Cupio dissolui. When we be
touched inwardly,Apoc. 22. and say with
the saintes in ye reuelation: Come

Lord Jesu, come quickly. These are
yt beginnings of those euerlasting
ioyes, that can neuer bee madefull
till this mortallitie haue put on immortalitie,
               1. Cor. 15. 53.
               and this corruptible, incorruption,
and wee haue geuen
into our mouthes, the songes of
our triūphe: O death where is thy
styng?
               1. Cor. 15. 55. 
               O hell where is thy victorye?
The songes of our joy,Apoc. 14. 
                     〈…〉
                  
                
               such as none
can vnderstand, saue the hūdreth &
foure and fortie thousand, that are
bought from the earth. He that eateth
of Christe to this purpose, he
is nourished, and he that drinketh
of Christ to this hope, he is quickned.
With this meate and drink,
Abraham was filled,Gene. 12. 1. 
               when he forsooke
his fathers house, his kindred,
his countrye, to go into a lande that
God would shew hym. With thys
meate and drinke Moses was filled,
when he rather chose to be a miserable
seruaunte among his brethren
of Israel,
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                   11 
               then to be a mighty Prince

in the court of Pharaoh.Psa. 84. 1 With this
meate and drinke was Dauid filled,
when he wished rather to be a dore
keeper in the house of God, then to
dwell in the Pallaces of Princes.
With this meate and drinke was
Paule filled,Phil. 3. 8. when hee sayde, he
accompted all the worlde as dunge
that he myght winne Christ. With
this meate & drinke who so euer
is filled,Math. 19. 19. 
               he will forsake father and
mother,
               Luke. 14. 26, 
               brother and sister, wyfe and
children, house and landes, yea euen
his owne soule, & take vp his crosse
and follow Christ. The remembrance
of immortalitie that Christ
shal geue vnto him, wil make him
hartely to cōfesse, yt this life is but
a momēt. The length of his daies
that liueth for euer, will make him
behold his owne body,Esay. 4. 6. and say: all
flesh is grasse. The glory of hys maiestie
that shineth world without
end, will proue the glory of man to
be but as a flower in the fielde. It

will make his harte to crye often
within him:Ioh. 16. 34. 
               Lorde feede vs euer
with this bread. And sure (dearelye
beloued) the cause is soone espyed,
why the worlde is so droncken,
with these transitorye vanities:
they neuer felt what the thynges
are, that abide for euer. He neuer
tasted of Christ that hungreth &
thirsteth after vayne glory, to become
honorable in this world. He
neuer tasted of Christ, yt heapeth
vp siluer and gold, and cānot tell
for whome he gathereth it. He neuer
tasted of Christ, that spendeth
his dayes in wantonnesse, and
harkeneth not to the sentence that
shalbe spoken vnto him:Luk. 16. 3 
               Come,
geue accompte of thy stewardshipe.
He neuer tasted of Christ yt hath
his eyes open to behold vanitie, &
seeth not Christ crucifyed for hys
sinnes. He neuer tasted of Christ,
that hath his eares open to al vngodlye

                  〈◊〉
                and heareth not

the Trumpet that one day shall
blow a loude: Arise ye dead, and
come vnto iudgement. To be short
he neuer tasted of Christ, that is
not crucified vnto the world, and
the world vnto him, so farre that
synne raygne not in hys mortall
body. The Prince neuer tasted of
Christ, yt putteth the glory of hys
court in concupiscence, in pride, in
blasphemie. The noble mā neuer
tasted of Christ, that braggeth &
boasteth of his parentage, and
knoweth not yt he is but dust. The
magistrate neuer tasted of Christ
