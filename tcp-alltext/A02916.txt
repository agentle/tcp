            TO THE
RIGHT HONORABLE,
and vertuous Ladie, the Ladie
ANNE, Counteſſe
of OXENFORD:
much honour, with increaſe
of godlineſſe
and vertue.
⁂
            
               
                  ALL THE
gouernement,
(Right Honorable)
of the
true, holie,
and Catholike
Church, which
hath ben from
the creation of
the world, vntil
this preſent age
is comprehended
in fiue orders
or degrees: the firſt of the Fathers, beginning at
Adam, &c: the ſecond of the Patriarches, beginning
at Abraham: the third of the Prophets, beginning
at Samuel: the fourth of the high Prieſts, beginning
at Iehoſhua, otherwiſe called Ieſus: the fift and



laſt of the Apoſtles, beginning at Saint Iohn Baptiſt.
            Among all which Apoſtles, none was more wonderfullie
called to the preaching of the Goſpell, than
S. Paule, who being a bold & common blaſphemer,
a bloudie and mercileſſe perſecuter, afflicting the
flocke of Chriſt with moſt terrible torments, was
notwithſtanding euen in the fire of his furie reclaimed,
and became the great teacher of the Gentiles,
deliuering vnto them ſuch heauenlie doctrine, as he
receiued by diuine inſpiration, apt to inſtruct, exhort,
rebuke, correct, and reforme, that the man of God
might be made perfect in all good workes.
            This Apoſtle, as before the time of his conuerſion,
which was in the verie yeare of Chriſts aſcenſion,
he ſhed much innocent bloud, making hauocke
of the members of the Church, with the ſword of
perſecution: ſo after the renouncing of his apoſtaticall
tyrannie, he ſaued manie thouſand ſoules, by the
preaching of the Goſpell, & word of reconciliation.
            For he taught the truth of the eternall God, whoſe
miniſter and veſſell of election he was, ordeined to
ſet forth his glorie before the face of the mightie, inſtantlie,
in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, by the ſpace of
thirtie ſixe yeares, to manie nations, profoundlie and
zealouſlie, beginning in the nineteenth yeare of Tiberius
at Damaſco: continuing it through out a great
part of the world, as appeareth by his painfull peregrination:
and finiſhing that good worke of his, in
the thirteenth yeare of Nero, whoſe priſoner he was,
and at his commandement put to death in Rome,
for the teſtimonie of the truth, which he ſealed with
the loſſe of his life, vnto the glorie of the great God.
            This bleſſed Apoſtle Saint Paule, was founder



of the Church of Chriſt at Epheſus, where he
preached the Goſpell of peace moſt ſincerelie: and
inſtructed the Epheſians in the neceſſarie doctrines
of their ſaluation, and in the deepe points of true religion:
as in predeſtination and election, in faith and
iuſtification, in praier and inuocation, in grace and adoption,
in manners and conuerſation, &c. as doth
manifeſtlie appeare in his Epiſtle, written to this people
out of bonds and impriſonment.
            The expoſition wherof (Right Honorable) M. Nicholas
Hemming, a learned, godlie, & excellent Diuine
vndertaking, & accompliſhing, hath ſo orderlie
& plainlie opened al the principal points therin conteined,
that nothing can ſeeme doubtfull or difficult,
no not to the ſimple and ignorant: beſides that, ſo
briefelie, that the memorie of the reader ſhall be able
to carrie awaie both his method and matter.
            Whoſe worke when I had read and peruſed, I turned
familiarlie into our Engliſh tong, becauſe I ſawe
it was a booke verie like to be beneficiall vnto euerie
priuate perſon. And hauing ended mine honeſt trauell,
I remembred (among diuers fauourers of learning,
and louers of godlineſſe) your good Ladiſhip:
whom as I honor for the ſame reſpects, ſo finding in
your Ladiſhip, among your other vertueſ, a zealous
loue to religion, and to the ſincere ſeruing of GOD,
(rare things in the multitude, what then in the honorable?)
I haue bene thereby induced, and thus boldlie
haue preſumed, to preaſe with this my poore preſent
vnto your Ladiſhip, in waie of dedication: and
doe praie your fauourable protection of the ſame.
Beſeeching, euen with humbleneſſe, that this my
homelie handeled Expoſitor, a ſtraunger borne, and



newlie araied with courſe Engliſh cloth, maie finde
ſuch fauour in your Ladiſhips preſence, as to be interteined.
            Not doubting, but the Author for his excellent
learning, and profound knowledge vttered therein,
ſhall thereby be able to withſtand all ſeditious Sciſmatikes,
quarelling Sycophants, impudent Papiſts,
peſtilent Pellagians, blaſphemous Anabaptiſts, licentious
Libertines, whoſe perillous opinions are by him
confuted: and finallie, all the malicious members
of Sathan that old ſerpents ſynagogue: to the
preferring of the truth, and the increaſe of
Gods glorie, vnto whoſe protection I commend
your good Ladiſhip: whoſe happineſſe
God graunt maie be ſuch,
both heere and aboue, as your
owne heart would wiſh, and as
my continuall and dailie
praier ſhalbe,
Amen.
            
               Your Honourable Ladiships
Moſt humblie to be commanded,
Abraham Fleming.
            
         
         
            
            TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, LEARned,
godlie, and excellent Diuine, M. Henrie
of Hertoghenboſch, of the auncient houſe of the
Bruchoffens, Deane of the Chapter of Lunden in Denmarke,
and his beloued brother in Chriſt,
NICHOLAS HEMMING wiſheth
health and welfare.
            
               I Heard (Right Worſhipfull) vpon
a time, at the mouth of that
good and godlie man, M. Philip
Melancthon, that There is no
worke more excellent, than to
teach & learne the word of God.
And it maie bée ſo verie well.
For, without heauenlie doctrine,Ephe. 4. 17. 18.
wée proll in moſt thicke
darkneſſe and ignorance: or (to vſe S. Paules ſpeach) We
walke in the vanitie of our minde, we wander through
our owne blinde vnderſtanding, and are farre off from the
life of God: becauſe our ignorance, and the hardneſſe of
our heart bringeth to paſſe,2. Cor. 7. 10. that we are touched with no
féeling at all of ſorowe for our ſinnes: without which féeling,
the voice of the Goſpell doth neuer waxe ſwéete vnto
man: but rather lie wide open, and giue vp our ſelues, to
the committing of all filthineſſe.
            Now, the word of God is a ſouereigne ſalue to heale vp
theſe ſores: when the ſame is ſincerelie taught, and faithfullie
learned. Which thing that kinglie Prophet Dauid
knowing well inough,Pſa. 119. 9. witneſſeth, ſaieng: In quo mundam,
&c. Wherewith ſhall a young man redreſſe his
waie? In taking heede thereto according to thy word:
which word (doubtleſſe) he ſaith in the ſame Pſalme,Pſa. 119. 24.
is his delight and counſellers. For this cauſe the ſame
Prophet,Pſa. 119. 127. preferreth that verie word, before all the
riches of the world, ſaieng: Diligo mandata, &c. I
loue thy commandements aboue gold: yea, aboue moſt



fine gold.
               Pſa. 119. 162. Againe, Laetabor ego ſuper, &c. I will reioice at
thy words,
               Pſa. 119. 72. 
               as one that findeth a great ſpoile. Againe, Melior
mihi lex, &c. The lawe of thy mouth is better vnto me,
than thouſands of gold and ſiluer.
            
            
               Dauid therefore confeſſeth, that the word of God, is the
moſt pretious treaſure in the world: and that our life is
vncleane, and our waie filthie, vntill they be cleanſed by
the word of God, as with water of the cleareſt fountaine.
Which thing is then done, when we obtaine faith by hearing,
and receiue the holie Ghoſt. For, then the miſtineſſe
of our mindes is driuen awaie, our vnderſtanding is lightened,
and our heart which was hard before like a ſtone, is
made fleſhie and ſoft: ſo that the lawe of God maie bée
written therein, euen to be touched with the féeling of ſin,
to defie and ſpit at ſinne, and to followe the counſels, not
of the fleſh, but of the ſpirit, in framing and ordering our
life. Séeing the doctrine of Gods word bringeth ſo manie
and great benefites, that notable man (whom euen now I
named) ſaith, euen vpon iuſt cauſe, that Among all the
workes of men, to teach and learne the word of God is the
moſt excellent.
            
            Now, forſomuch as the word of God is a treaſure ſo pretions,
& to teach and learne the word of God, a worke ſo
excellent, what ſhall we ſaie of the ſincere & true teachers
of this word? What ſhall we ſaie of them, which deliuered
the word of God, as it were from deſtruction, when it laie
ouertroden with the horrible imaginations of men, and
deuiſes of diuels, as in moſt filthie mire, and made the
ſame faire and cleane with their ſound and ſincere expoſitions?
We are greatlie indebted to them, which ſée to the
prouiſion of ſuch neceſſaries as belong to the maintenance
of this life, and without which theſe fraile bodies of ours
cannot continue in health: but we are neuer able to requite
them with the like, which haue reſtored and made
doctrine pure againe, béeing the verie treaſure, without
the which we fall from all hope of euerlaſting life, and



haue deliuered the ſame doctrine vnto vs, both by word
of mouth, and in writing, ſound and ſincere.
            In the number of theſe I reckon M. Philip Melancthon,
               M. Philip Melancthon commended.
our ſchoolemaſter, a man worthie of the firſt place
next vnder M. Martine Luther: than whom all Germanie
neuer bred and brought vp one ſharper in wit, quicker
in iudgement, perfecter in knowledge, greater in
learning, readier & ſounder in expounding the ſcripture
roundlie: yea, & more than that, zealouſer in godlineſſe,
and earneſter in religion▪ In conſideration of which notable
and ſingular gifts, he is had in great account and
eſtimation, not onelie of them which profeſſe the ſame religion
with vs: but alſo of the verie enimies of true religion.
            When Saint Paule wrote to the Philippians of his
time,Phi. 2. 29. concerning Epaphroditus, ſaieng: Excipite ipſum
in domino, & Receiue him in the Lord, with all gladneſſe,
and make much of ſuch: the holie Ghoſt meaneth
indéed thereby: yea, willeth vs, to take them for Gods
inſtruments: openlie to confeſſe the benefits which wée
receiue by the meanes of ſuch men, to be of God: to reuerence
them as our ſchoolemaſters: to loue them as
our fathers: to eſtéeme of them as the builders vp of
Gods Church: and to make accompt of them as the moſt
principall pillers of Gods Temple. Thus much doeth
godlineſſe deſire: and their trauels deſerue no leſſe.
            We muſt not therefore giue them anie place, whoſe
practiſe it is to deuiſe ſlauders, reproches, and foule ſpeaches,
thereby doing what they can, to put out ſo great
lights of the Church: who, if they ſéems to haue done amiſſe
in anie thing, let vs make the beſt of it, for Chriſtian
charitie, and méekneſſe ſake. It is a true ſaieng of
Xenophon: 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               .
Which ſound thus béeing
expounded: It is a hard matter for men ſo to do a thing,



that it be amiſſe in no point: and it is hard for them alſo
that do a thing in no reſpect blame-worthy, not to light
vpō ſome quareling findfault. For the weaknes of men
is great, and manie eſcapes are made in a mans life,
which are rather friendlie & fauourablie to be couered,
than maliciouſlie and enuiouſlie to be made worſe.
            There is alſo in manie a great lightneſſe, which maketh
men to be ſharper iudges againſt others, that haue
not offended at all. As for our weakneſſe, let vs lament
it: and as for our lightneſſe, (which is the cauſe that
they are euill thought of, whoſe labours are greater, and
their gifts excellenter,) let vs leaue it: giuing God
thankes, who ſendeth into his Church, for the edification
or building vp thereof, ſuch healthfull inſtruments.
            And although verie great thankes (as méete is) are
due to them, which haue found out & made redie the firſt
waie: yet notwithſtanding, others that haue followed
after in their place, and trie all the maſteries they maie,
for the edification or building vp of the Church, and the
knitting together of the Saints, are not to bée ſette at
naught: but euerie one in his place is to be had in accompt.Acts. 18. 3 & 20. 34
Saint Paule was a worthie and choſen inſtrument
of God, than whom not one of the Apoſtles laboured
more,2. Cor. 11. 22. 23. 24, &c. nor ſpread the Goſpell of Chriſt further. Titus
alſo, who remained in the Iſle of Crete, was leſſer
than Saint Paule,
               1. Theſ. 2. 9. 10. both in giftes and labours: and alſo
in degrée of calling. Héere I acknowledge and giue
Saint Paule his title,Tit. 1. 5. to be the great teacher of the
Gentiles: and as for Titus, I reuerence him according
to his place, who learned at S. Paules mouth
thoſe things, which afterwards he deliuered to his hearers.
            In like ſort, I acknowledge and reuerence M. Martine
Luther, & M. Philip Melancthon, as the principall
and chiefeſt teachers that euer Gods Church had in our
age: the like I doe alſo to all, and euerie one of them in



their place, as the healthfull inſtruments of God in his
Church: by whoſe workes I ſet great ſtore, & am alſo
right glad, that it was my lucke to be of their number,
which acknowledge & reuerence M. Mart. Luther, &. M.
Philip Melancthon, their ſchoolemaiſters For, out of the
riuers, which they fetcht from the fountaines of Iſrael, I
confeſſe my ſelfe to haue drawne that which I ſet abroch,
and teach in this Vniuerſitie of Coppenhagen, as a miniſter
of the Goſpell of God, and according to the order
of my calling.
            I deſpiſe no man, I thinke not better of mine owne
opinions than of other mens iudgements: but I yeeld
and ſubmit my ſelfe to the Catholike Church of God, as
my iudge: which Church I de
                  •••
               re to be, not the Fathers
and Mothers of Neptune counſell: but thoſe that i
                  •
               boare
Auguſta confeſſion: that is to ſaie, all ſuch as holde the
Creeds ſound & vncorrupt: in what place ſo euer they be
ſcattered. I condemne no man, if he diſagree from mee: ſo
that he ouerthrowe not the foundation: that is to ſaie,
the Créeds.
            I acknowledge the weakneſſe of vs all, which I both bewaile,Pſal. 127. 1.
& beſéech God to ſet to his owne hand to the building.
Niſi enim Dominus, &c. For except the Lord build
the houſe, they labour in vaine that build it. I allow
euerie ones endeuour, that beſtowe anie paines at all toward
the building of Gods Church: in whoſe number,
although I graunt my ſelfe to be the verie leaſt: yet notwithſtanding,
I am of this minde,Mat. 25. 14, &c. that the talent which
God hath giuen me, muſt not lie hid vnoccupied.
            And becauſe it is not my ſéeking, to ſerue the hearers
preſent onelie, but thoſe that are abſent alſo: yea, the
whole Church of Chriſt, I haue put ſome of mine owne
writings to the preſſe, cauſed them to bée printed, & ſent
them abroad. With like aduiſement alſo, I haue publiſhed
theſe my notes vpon the Epiſtle of S. Paule to
the Epheſians: beeing willing to haue them come abroad



vnder your name (Right worſhipfull:) that ſome token of
my thankfulneſſe to you wards maie be ſéene, whom it
hath pleaſed, not onelie to ſtand my good & ſincere friend,
all the time that you tarried in this realme: but alſo to
vouchſafe the beſtowing of verie manie benefits vpon
me: as for thoſe great benefits & good deeds, which you
haue done to our Vniuerſitie, & to euerie ſtudent of the
ſame, I let them paſſe vnſpoken. For I know, your worſhip
is of their number, which had rather do good, (God
beholding it,) than to be praiſed of men, and to hunt
after vaine glorie at their mouth. For they that doe
ſo,Mat. 6. 1. 2 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , receiue their reward.
For they are hirelings which ſerue for hire, and not the
children of God, which doe God ſeruice of their owne
accord.
            Well maie your worſhip fare, and I praie you take in
good part the gift that I ſend, fauourablie iudgeing of the
ſame, according to your manner: and if anie thing miſlike
you, let me haue vnderſtanding thereof. For your
iudgement ruleth me much. Once againe I wiſh you
well to fare, with that right honeſt Gentlewoman, miſtreſſe
Anne your wife, who (as I heare ſaie) hath increaſed
your houſhold with a yong babe. God grant that
it maie turne to his glorie, and to yours, and the mothers
ioie and comfort. I praie you haue me commended to M.
Tyco your Biſhop, M. Veſſele your Chaunter, M.
Balthaſar your Archdeacon, M. Magnus your diuinitie

            ¶The Argument vpon the Epiſtle
of the Apoſtle Saint Paule to the
Epheſians.
            
               THat we may the more fully perceiue and
vnderſtand the argument of this moſt holy
Epiſtle, written to the Epheſians, out
of the priſon at Rome: wée muſt make
declaration of thoſe foure points, which I
am wont to touch in the beginning of
mine expoſitions vpon the holy Scriptures.
            
               The foure pointes are theſe.
            
            Firſt, Who was the Author of this Epiſtle. For to
knowe this, maketh very much for the winning of worthineſſe,
and authoritie to this Epiſtle.
            Secondly, What was the occaſion why the ſame was
written. For the marking héereof, maketh very much,
both to vnderſtand the perfect diſcourſe of the whole matter,
and alſo to declare the order of the queſtions.
            Thirdly, What is the ſtate or principall queſtion,
whereby the kinde of the cauſe is knowne: & the ende or
ſcope of him which ſpeaketh is vnderſtoode.
            Fourthly, What is the order of handling: which being
not vnderſtoode, the weight & importaunce of things cannot
be obſerued. To conclude, it often times falleth out,
that the methode or manner of ſpeaking béeing not marked,
circumſtances contrarie & beſide the meaning of the
writer, are heaped vp together, and many things are wreſted
of heretikes, for the confirmation of their wicked &
erronious opinions: as is to be ſene in their writings, who
in iudging, vſe not the rule of Logicke: but handle all
and euery ſeuerall part or parcell, as it were members
plucked off from the bodie.
            Of theſe foure points therfore we will orderly intreat,
to the intent that we may the more eaſily attaine to the



vnderſtanding of this diuine Epiſtle.
            
               Of the firſt.
               THe Authour of this Epiſtle is the Apoſtle Paule, that
great Doctor or teacher of the Gentiles: who, as he
was called to the office and miniſterie of an Apoſtle, by
the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo was he inſtructed and
taught the myſterie of ſaluation, by the ſame Ieſus
Chriſt. This Apoſtle, like a valiaunt ſouldier of Chriſt,
being adorned and deckt with ſouldierlike enſignes and
armes of the field, to wit, with ſundry ſorts of tribulations
and perſecutions,2. Cor. 11. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. with whippings, ſtonings, buffetings,
reuilings, &c. by the ſpace of fiue and thirtie yeres
almoſt, wrote this Epiſtle in Priſon at Rome to ye 
                  Epheſians,
drawing to an end of his life. Forſomuch therefore
as the Authour of this Epiſtle, is a man of ſuch accompt,
it is not lawfull to call in doubt, either the weightineſſe
of the matter, or the authoritie of the writer. Wherfore,
whatſoeuer things are deliuered vnto vs in this Epiſtle,
we ought no leſſe to reuerence and conſider, than the verie
things themſelues, which God by his owne mouth
hath vttered and ſpoken from Heauen. And therefore,
as the doctrine conteined in this Epiſtle, is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  :
that is to ſay, by inſpiration from God: ſo hath it
verie great weight & force to confirme the articles of our
religion, and to confute errours, and that in ſuch ſort, as
that no man, vnleſſe he be altogether godleſſe, and a profeſſed
or ſworne enimie to Chriſt, will ſet himſelfe againſt
the worthineſſe and authoritie of this moſt holie
Epiſtle. Many more things, touching this our Apoſtle,
may be read in the Actes of the Apoſtles, & in his owne
Epiſtles to the Galathians, the Corinthians, and others.
            
            
               Of the ſecond.
               AN offence taken at the croſſe, miniſtred an occaſion
to the Apoſtle, of writing this Epiſtle. For at ſuch



time as Paule, hauing finiſhed his courſe of preaching,
was caſt into priſon at Rome, and that the godlie euerie
where were afflicted, not onely by Tyrants, but alſo
of falſe Apoſtles: he thought it a part of his charge and
calling, to confirme the Epheſians, by writing to them,
whom bicauſe of his abſence, he could not teach: leaſt
that, either for his owne croſſe, or for the perſecutions of
the Church, which at that time were excéeding great, they
ſhould fall from that grace, wherof they were made partakers
by the preaching of the Goſpell. As therefore the
offence of the croſſe, moued this moſt holie Apoſtle of
Chriſt to write: ſo the ende of his writing was, to arme
the Epheſians, that they might inuincibly ſtand, & perſiſt
in that doctrine of Chriſt, which they had learned of him.
            
            
               Of the third.
               BEcauſe the ſpeciall part of this Epiſtle conſiſteth in
expoſition, the full ſcope thereof doth leſſe ſhew it ſelfe,
than if it were reaſoned and diſputed vpon: which notwithſtanding
ſhall eaſilie be atteined, when the ende of
his writing is perceiued. Out of the firſt, ſecond & third
Chapters therefore is this principall ſcope or ſumme gathered:
namelie, That the doctrine concerning the grace
of God, and his mercie through Ieſus Chriſt, is no newlie
vpſtart doctrine, neither belongeth to one ſort or ſect of
men onelie: but that the ſame, euen from before the world
was created, vntill this day, was in ſuch order ſtabliſhed
by God himſelfe, yt ſo manie ſhould be ſaued in Chriſt,
as beléeued in him,Rom. 1. 16 not onelie Iewes, but alſo Gentiles,
among whom were the Epheſians. This ſcope or ſumme
is declared in a large expoſition, & trimlie ſet out or deckt
with weightie words and ſentences: and this is done in
the thrée firſt Chapters. Héereby moſt euidentlie apeareth,
how neceſſarie the doctrine is, which is deliuered in this
Epiſtle. In the thrée laſt Chapters, diuers exhortations
are interlaced, and duties alſo, as well common to all eſtates,
as peculiar to ſome, are commended to the godlie.
            
            
               
               Of the fourth.
               THe occaſion, the full ſcope or ſumme, and the ende,
why this Epiſtle was written, béeing knowne, the
order or method of handling the ſame, may the more eaſily
be declared, and alſo vnderſtoode. There are (beſides
the title, the gréeting, and the knitting vp or farewell of
this Epiſtle) two principall parts, namely, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is to ſay, Doctrine and Exhortation:
wherof doctrine is by nature the firſt, & exhortation the ſecond
by order. For this is the perpetual order of Moſes, of
the Prophets, of Chriſt, of the Apoſtles, and of all ſuch as
teach aright: that vpon doctrine, which they deliuer in the
firſt place, they frame & bring in their admonitions, their
exhortations, their comminations or threatenings, their
reprehenſions or rebukings, their conſolations, &c. For ſo
doe they applie their doctrine to the hearers. And ſurely,
a ſmall matter it is to teach well, except therwithall thou
ſtirre vp the ſlouthfull with certeine pricks, except thou
refreſh and comfort the fearefull, except thou rebuke and
chide the ſtubburne and wilfull, &c.
               Furthermore, the former part, which is called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
Doctrine, is not 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : that is to ſay, ſtandeth
not vpon diſputation or reaſoning: but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is
to ſay, conſiſts in expoſitiō. For it conteineth an expoſition
of the myſterie of our ſaluation, & that firſt in generall,
towardes all the elect or choſen, declaring, that it is not a
new myſterie of ſaluation, but in ſuch ſort ordeined and
eſtabliſhed, before the creation of the world, by the méere
goodneſſe of our heauenly Father, that he would ſaue all
beléeuers, in his beloued ſonne. Then he diuideth the
generalitie, & applieth the ſame to the ſpecialties: ſhewing,
That the benefit of reconciliation or attonement, doth
indifferently belong to the Iewes and to the Gentiles,
among whom were the Epheſians. And as Rhetoricians
teach, what is to be obſerued in the expoſition of things,



ſo he beateth in more déeply the cauſes & the circumſtances.
For he ſetteth downe moſt diligently, the cauſes efficient,
materiall, formall and finall of this myſterie, making
a repetition of the ſelfe ſame things yet againe, both
that a deſire of this ſo great a myſterie, might be kindled
the more in the mindes of the Epheſians: & alſo that
they might not (for any cauſes whatſoeuer) fall from ſo
great grace. Héerevpon alſo it ariſeth, that he ſaith, he giueth
God thankes, for that he hath vouchſafed to reueale
his myſterie of the ſaluation of mankinde, to the Epheſians:
& that he witneſſeth likewiſe, that he praide vnto God
for the Epheſians, that they might profit daily more and
more, in the knowledge of this myſterie.
               Now, that he might perſuade the Epheſians, that ſaluation
fréely giuen, doth alſo pertaine to them, he ſheweth
how he himſelfe was called and taught, by the reuelation
of Ieſus Chriſt, to preach the Goſpell or glad tidings
of ſaluation freely giuen, not to the Iewes onely but
to the Gentiles alſo, the difference betwéene the Iewes and
the Gentiles being taken away by the cōming of Chriſt:
ſo that ſaluation fréely giuen, is indifferently, and without
reſpect, offered to the Gentiles, and to the Iewes: faith
béeing the inſtrument whereby it is receiued.
               Hitherto haue we touched the former part of this Epiſtle,
which he knitteth vp and endeth with a thankſgiuing,
according to his vſuall manner.
               Héere let the Readers diligently marke, how fitly
all things are applied to the ſcope and ende of his writing.
If grace be powred out ſo plentifully vpon all
men: if the myſterie of ſaluation decréed, and purpoſed
before the creation of the world, be preached: if in his beloued
ſonne he loueth the beléeuers: if he ſeale ſaluation &
grace by his ſpirit: if he ſende Apoſtles and Ambaſſadours
with grace of this myſterie: if it bée a gift and
benefit fréely giuen: if by the preaching of this benefit the
praiſe and glorie of God is teſtified: to be ſhort, if the



holineſſe and ſaluation of men be ſought: what man or
woman, vnleſſe they be wodde & witleſſe, contemners and
deſpiſers of their owne ſaluation, but will confeſſe that it
is meruellous neceſſarie to ſtand ſledfaſtly in this doctrine,
& with a valiant & inuincible minde and courage,
to ſuffer rather any torments, than to fall from ſo great
grace and ſaluation.
               The latter part which ſtandeth vpon exhortation,
is diuerſe & manifolde. For in this the Apoſtle exhorteth
firſt of all to the vnitie of ſpirit in loue & charitie: then he
goeth to common dueties, as it were to ye ſpecialties of the
generalitie. Then, by reaſons repugnant & contrarie to
our vocation or calling, he weaneth and withdraweth
vs from viceſ, and declareth (by compariſon) what
the godly ought to do. Heerevnto he addeth precepts concerning
domeſticall diſcipline, or houſehold gouernment.
For he inioineth huſbands & wiues, parents & children,
maiſters and ſeruaunts, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  officia ſib
                        •
                     
inuicem reddere, that is to ſay, to vſe ſemblaunt and
proportionable duties one towards and other: all which he
draweth out of the fountaine of faith & loue, applieng to
each ſeuerally that which to them is conuenient. After
this he maketh vp the panoplie or warlike furniture of
Chriſtian ſouldiers, and therwithall he armeth the Epheſians,
againſt Sathan the enimie of mans ſaluation: vnto
this part be ioineth are queſt, that the Epheſians would
pray for him. Laſtly, he maketh mention of Tychicus,
whom he ſent vnto them with this Epiſtle, of whom (as
he certifieth them) they might know his eſtate: & ſo at the
length, with a well wiſhing vnto them, according to his
cuſtome, he maketh en ende. Let this be ſufficient to be
ſpoken of the order and method of handling this Epiſtle.
Now, in the explication or expounding of euery ſeuerall
Chapter. I will (after my manner) kéepe this order. Firſt,
I will gather & drawe euery ſeuerall Chapter to a certaine
ſummarie or head Secondly, & will ſet downe the



order and parts of euery ſeuerall Chapter. Thirdly and
laſtly, I will adde an expoſition, & an obſeruation of ſuch
doctrines as we ſhall méete, with an applieng of them to
our vſe and practiſe. The firſt bringeth this benefit,
that whatſoeuer is Rhetorically ſpoken, the ſame béeing
examined ſummarily by Logick, may the more eaſily bée
vnderſtood, and in few words or ſhort ſpeach once conceiued,
may ſticke the faſter in memorie. The ſecond, which
is the middlemoſt, doth helpe as well the interpreter or
teacher, as alſo ye learners or ſcholers. It helpeth the interpreter
or teacher, leaſt he, forgetting thoſe things wherof
ſpeciall conſideration ſhould be had, might breake out into
ſtraieng opinions, nothing belonging to the Authors
meaning: which thing in ſequele ingendreth many corruptions,
diuerſitie of opinions, vnprofitable diſputations,
ſects & hereſies. It helpeth ye learners or ſcholers, bicauſe
they (beſids obſeruation & marking of the order, than the
which nothing is more handſome & commendable) ma
                     •
                  
the more narrowly ſée into ye pith & ſubſtance of things
whereby iudgment is formed in the learners, to the end
yt they in other writings may obſerue & marke the phraſe
and manner of ſpeach. The laſt examineth the order of
things, bringeth light to that which is hidden & darke, vntieth
yt which is intangled & ſnarled, & ſheweth the vſe of
thoſe things, which are declared in our life: by which
meanes it commeth to paſſe (as the Apoſtle ſaith) that out
of the Scriptures we draw knowledge, comfort, patience,
and hope.
            
         
         
            THE FIRST CHAPTER.
            
               The ſumme of the firſt Chapter.
               AS God reuealeth ye miſterie of ſaluation by his goſpel
vnto them, whō (according to his good wil & pleaſure)
he hath choſen in his beloued ſonne, for the praiſe of his
glorie: ſo he ſealeth them with his ſpirit: & Paule teſtifieth
yt the Epheſians are in ye number. Wherfore he giueth



God thankes for them, and praieth that they might more
and more abound.
            
            
               The order and partes of the Chapter.
               THe order of the Chapter is this. After the inſcription
or title, & the deſire or wiſh, followeth in the firſt place
a thankſgiuing, a reaſon béeing taken from the manifolde
bleſſing & grace of God, moſt liberally powred foorth vpon
all mankinde. Héerevnto is added a notable expoſition
of this grace of God towards all mankinde, and that
altogether Rhetoricall. For firſt of all he ſetteth out and
commendeth this grace of God towardes mankinde: and
by reaſons drawn from the Cauſes and Effects he amplifieth
and inlargeth it. Then he goeth from the generalitie
vnto two ſpecialities: and this partaking of grace hée
applieth firſt to the Iewes, and ſecondly to the Gentiles,
but vnder the name of the Epheſians. Moreouer, to the
ende that the Epheſians might acknowledge the greatneſſe
of this grace, and thinke vpon perſeueraunce or conſtancie,
he ſaith that he giueth God thankes for reuealing
vnto them the myſterie of ſaluation, and that he praieth
vnto God, that they may increaſe & abound therein more
and more. From whence he falleth againe into the ſetting
foorth and commending of Gods benefits.
            
            
               ¶The expoſition of the firſt Chapter, with the obſeruation
of doctrines therein contained.
               
                  
                     1. Verſe.
                  
                  PAVLE an Apoſtle of Ieſus
Chriſt by the will of God, to
the Saintes which are at Epheſus,
and to the faithfull in
Chriſt Ieſus.
                  PAVLE an Apoſtle of Ieſus
Chriſt by the will of God. To
the Saintes which are at Epheſus,
and to them which beleeue in Ieſus
Chriſt.
                  
                     THere are two partes of this inſcription
or title, the firſt whereof containeth
thrée things, to wit. The proper name
of the perſon which writeth. The worthineſſe
of his office, and the authoritie
of his function Apoſtolicall. Héerevpon



we may gather firſt of all, what accompt is to be made of
the doctrine of the Apoſtle, who was made an Apoſtle
of Ieſus Chriſt, by the will of God. Secondly, we may
learne heereby in generall, not onely what the authoritie
of Miniſters is, which bring Paules doctrine: but alſo
what manner confeſſion of their function and calling is
required. Wée muſt conclude vpon both, that we muſt
not giue place to aſſemblies of men ſitting in councell,
or to the authoritie of any man or men, if they commaund
or bring in any thing contrarie or againſt this doctrine
of the Apoſtle. For it is not méete that the authoritie and
vioce of God ſhould giue place to the traditions, or
to the ſuperioritie of men or diuels. To this agréeth that
ſaieng of Saint Paule to the Galathians. If an Angel
from Heauen preach otherwiſe than we haue preached,
let him be accurſed.
                  
                  The ſecond part of the inſcription or title, doth not onely
name them, vnto whome the Apoſtle writeth, to wit,
the Epheſians: but alſo adorneth and beautifieth them with
moſt excellent titles, whilſt it calleth them by the name
of Saintes and Faithfull. Which two names are ſo iointly
linked together by nature, that of whome ſo euer the
one is ſpoken, the other alſo is moſt truely meant and vttered.
For they cannot be ſeparated either from other:
bicauſe, who ſo euer is faithfull is a Saint: and who
ſo euer is a Saint is faithfull. Whoſoeuer beléeueth
truly is holie: and againe, euery one that is holie doth beléeue.
                  Now, we are made Saints, or holie by this meanes.
The faith of the Goſpel doth ſeparate vs from the vnholineſſe
of the world, & bringeth vs vnto ye familie or houſeholde
of God: by this ſelfe ſame faith we are purified and
made cleane. For whoſoeuer beléeueth in Chriſt, is both
purged and alſo healed by his bloud. Furthermore, by this
ſelfe ſame faith we are preſented before God, that we
might be a liuelie ſacrifice, pleaſing God thorough Ieſus



Chriſt. Whoſoeuer therefore is ſeparated from the vnholineſſe
of the world, is purified by the bloud of Chriſt, &
is ſlaine to be a liuely ſacrifice vnto God, through Ieſus
Chriſt, the ſame is a Saint & holie in déede, notwithſtanding
he perceiue in himſelfe certaine ſpottes and blemiſhes,
which he doth what he can to waſh away & auoide.
                  This place doth ſhew, as well what things are ioined
to a true faith: as alſo that the faithfull is reputed
a Saint or holie one before God, euen by the iudgement
of the holie Ghoſt. The wordes of Chryſoſtome in this
place are excellent. Loe (ſaith he) Saint Paule calleth ſuch
men Saintes, as had wiues, children, and an houſeholde.
For afterwards followeth the proper termes whereby
he termeth them, to wit, Husbands, wiues, maiſters and
ſeruaunts, and to them he commendeth mutuall dueties.
By this terming of them Saints therfore, ye peſtilent errour
of Monks is confuted, who put ſanctitie or holines
in ſingle life, and in fained or diſſembled virginitie. Vnto
theſe alſo I adde, that they likewiſe are confuted by this
place, who bragged and boaſted of a preciſe choice of pouertie,
as of the perfection & fulnes of Chriſtian holines.
For among the Epheſians, were many ſaithfull perſons,
which did abound in riches & wealth: yet they, notwithſtanding
their conuerſion by the preaching of Paule,
caſt not away their riches, or ſet their ſubſtaunce at
naught.
               
               
                  
                     2. Verſe.
                  
                  Grace be vvith you, & peace,
from God our Father, and from
the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                  Grace bee with you, and peace,
from God our Father, and from
the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                  THis deſire or well wiſhing of the Apoſtle, comprehendeth
a ſummarie of the benefits of the Goſpell. Firſt
he wiſheth vnto the Epheſians Gods grace: which ſignifieth
vnto vs, as well the free good will of God, as alſo
euerie gift whatſoeuer is giuen vs of God. Secondly hée
wiſheth peace vnto them, that is to ſay, reconciliation or



attonement of our ſelues with God: he wiſheth likewiſe
vnto them ſuch things as are ioined with this reconciliation:
namely, the ioy of ſpirit, and a quiet conſcience.
                  Now, from whence this grace and peace procéedeth,
& by whom we poſſeſſe them, the Apoſtle declareth, when
he ſaith (From God our Father, and from the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt.) From God the Father, as from the beginning &
fountain: & from ye Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as frō ye Mediatour.
For as the Father is the fountaine of all graces: ſo the
ſonne is both the matter & merit of all grace & peace. Héere
therefore, euen in the verie enterance of this Epiſtle, all
merits of men, and all dreames of Monks, touching their
traditiōs, all their Merita congrui, digni & condig
                           ••
                        : that
is, of congruitie & worthineſſe, &c. are put to ſilence. For
ſo often as grace is preached ſo often are the merits of
men ouerthrowne and condemned. For how can that be
of merit, which is of grace? For that ſaieng of the holie
Ghoſt ſtandeth vnremouable, Si ex gratia, non ampliùs
ex operibus:
                     Rom. 11. 6 
                     alioqui gratia non eſt gratia, &c. If it be of
grace, it is no more of works, or elſe were grace no more
grace. But if it be of works, it is no more grace, or elſe
were worke no more worke. The Apoſtle, in this place
doth ſo oppoſe and ſet grace and worke one againſt the
other, that both of them can by no meanes be attributed
to one ſelfe ſame third thing, neither yet the one aſcribed
to the other.
                  Moreouer, this well wiſhing doth teach vs, that we
can obtaine no good thing at Gods hand, but that
which procéedeth from God, by and through our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt. Saint Paule therefore ſendeth vs to the
Well head of all goodneſſe, and there withall requireth
faith, which is the bucket, whereby wee drawe all goodneſſe
out of this Well head. For as the foundation of
this grace and peace, is the good will of God, and his fatherly
loue, in hauing compaſſion of man: ſo man is the
marke or ende wherevnto this foundation is referred,



but yet by faith. For faith is the inſtrument, whereby
this grace and reconciliation offered vnto vs, is receiued,
and poſſeſſed.
               
               
                  
                     3. Verſe.
                  
                  Bleſſed be God, euen the father
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                  Bleſſed be God the Father of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                  THe apoſtle beginneth with thankſgiuing: which tendeth
héerevnto, euen to admoniſh vs of our duetie. For it is
not conuenient, that we ſhould lightly paſſe ouer and let
ſlip any grace of God, without praiſing & magnifieng his
name for the ſame.
                  The word (Bleſsing) which Saint Paul vſeth in this
place hath not a ſimple ſignification, but varieth in conſideration
of that wherevnto it is applied: for God bleſſeth
man, man bleſſeth God, and man bleſſeth man: howbeit
diuerſe and differing waies. When God is ſaid to
bleſſe man, ye meaning is, That God in ſpeaking the word,
proſpereth and dealeth well with him. For the worde of
God is his worke: and what he ſaith, is done. Man is ſaid
to bleſſe God, when with a true faith he praiſeth & glorifieth
God for his benefits, through Ieſus Chriſt, and that
with the heart, & outward confeſſion of the mouth. That
this is ſo, it is euident: bicauſe the Scripture vſeth theſe
wordes, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (well wiſhing, and bleſſing)
indifferently, the one for the other. Man is ſaid to
bleſſe man, when he wiſheth him proſperitie, and praieth
that all things may goe well with him.
                  
                     Furthermore, the prieſtlie bleſſing is not to be ſuppoſed
the bleſſing of man onely, but rather of God: in which
bleſſing the commaundement & the promiſe is to be marked.
The commaundement is this: Benedicetis, &c. (Thus
ſhall you bleſſe the children of Iſrael (ſaith the Lord) &
ſay vnto them:Num. 6. 23 The Lord bleſſe thee and keepe thee, The
Lord make his face ſhine vpon thee, & be mercifull vnto
thee, The Lord lift vp his countenaunce vpon thee, and



giue thee peace.) The promiſe is this: Inuocabunt Sacerdotes,
&c. The Prieſts ſhall put my name vpon the children
of Iſrael, and I will bleſſe them.) This promiſe is
to be receiued by faith, and it ſtaieth vpon the merite of
Chriſt, in whome all the promiſes of God are, yea, and
Amen.
               
               
                  
                     3. Verſe.
                  
                  Who hath bleſſed vs vvith all
ſpirituall bleſſing, in heauenly
things in Chriſt.
                  VVhich hath bleſſed vs with all
manner of ſpirituall bleſſing in
heauenly things by Chriſt.
                  THis is the reaſon of his thankſgiuing, wherein hee
comprehendeth very great things in ſingular ſhortnes.
For firſt of all he ſetteth foorth the fountaine and Author
of all bleſſing, that is to ſay, of all proſperitie: namely,
God the Father, who of his fatherly good will bleſſeth vs.
Secondly, he giueth vs a ſight of the obiect: to wit, man, vpon
whom God hath powred his bleſſing moſt liberally.
Thirdly, he declareth the peculiar bleſſing, which is handled
in this place, to be ſpirituall grace, whereby wée are
adopted, and made heires of euerlaſting life. Fourthly, he
ſheweth that this peculiar and excellent bleſſing is not to
be ſought for in the worlde, but in heauen: and that it is
begun firſt heere, but there ended and made perfect. Fiftly
and laſtly, he addeth the matter of this ſpirituall bleſſing.
For Chriſt is the matter and merite of the ſame.
                  Marke how many and how heauenly things the Apoſtle
knitteth vp in a very few words. As the firſt and the
ſecond point teach vs, that God is the Fountaine of all
good: ſo they beate downe and kéepe vnder all arrogancie,
and pride of man. The third point teacheth vs, that the
benefits of the Goſpel are ſpiritual. The fourth ſendeth vs
to heauen by faith, where the treaſure of all bleſſing is laid
vp in Chriſt. The fift and laſt ouerthroweth mightily all
merites of men. For the merit of this heauenlie bleſſing
is in none other, but in Chriſt alone.
               
               
                  
                  
                     4. Verſe.
                  
                  As he hath choſen vs in him,
before the foundation of the
world, that vve ſhould be holie
& vvithout blame before him.
                  According as he hath choſen vs
in him before the creation of the
world, that we ſhould be Saints &
vnreproueable before him in loue.
                  THis is a reaſon of that which the Apoſtle ſaid before.
For as in the laſt verſe he ſet downe a reaſon,
why we are bound by dutie, to extoll the goodneſſe
of God: to wit, becauſe he hath moſt liberallie powred
his ſpirituall bleſſing vpon vs, whereby he hath bleſſed
vs in Chriſt: ſo héere is annered a reaſon of that reaſon,
by expoſition. Wherein, as he comprehendeth the foundation
and matter of that heauenlie grace or ſpirituall
bleſſing: ſo likewiſe he ſhutteth vp, as it were in a verie
briefe Aphoriſme, the time and laſt ende of the ſame: to
the intent that this myſterie might the more manifeſtlie
appeare before our eies.
                  The foundation of our ſpirituall bleſſing, or heauenlie
grace, or of our ſaluation, the Apoſtle maketh Gods eternall
election, whereby he vouchſafed to chooſe ſuch as
ſhould beléeue in him, before the creation of the world.
                  The matter thereof is Chriſt. For in him onelie heauenlie
grace doth reſt: yea, our life & ſaluation is in him.
Héere we muſt take verie great héede, that we ſeparate
not election from his proper matter. For we muſt not
dreame of anie election without Chriſt. God hath not choſen
vs ſimplie, but in Chriſt, that is to ſay, as members
of Chriſt, knit by faith vnto Chriſt our head. He ſaith that
this election in Chriſt, was therefore wrought before the
world was made: leaſt the Epheſians ſhould thinke, that
this Goſpell or doctrine of obteining ſaluation by Chriſt,
was preached by Paule at happe hazard or aduentures,
as a doctrine but latelie hatcht: but that they might rather
know, that it was the eternall counſell or purpoſe of
God, to giue ſaluation to all that beléeue in Chriſt.
                  The laſt ende of this heauenlie bleſſing is added, to
wit, (That we ſhould be holie, & without blame before



him in loue,) which is the fountaine of all other chriſtian
duties. This high and excellent calling therefore doeth
require holineſſe and innocencie of life, as the laſt end or
effect of ſpirituall bleſſing.
                  Thus far we haue ſhewed the meaning of ye Apoſtle, now
let vs ſee what doctrine & comfort is to be gotten therby.
                  Firſt therefore, where he ſaith, that (We are choſen in
Chriſt before the foundation of the world) we may thervpon,
as vpon an vnmoueable principle, conclude theſe
ſpecialties: to wit, That our election is frée, that it is
without vs, that election is not to be ſought in the matter
of man, that election is firme & ratified, that our ſaluation
is founded in Chriſt alone, that all merits of men are
excluded, that they are called elect or choſen, which are in
Chriſt by faith: for the principle of our ſaluation ſtandeth
ſtedfaſt, He that beleeueth in the ſonne, ſhall not
periſh, but ſhall haue euerlaſting life. For by faith a paſſage
is made frō eternal election, to glorification to come.
                  Some, out of this place doe reaſon in this manner, God
hath choſen ſome, in Chriſt, before the foundation of the
world, Ergo God ordeined the fall of man before the foundation
of the world. For of them which fell, ſome are choſen
to life, and ſome are reſerued or kept to due condemnation.
Now ſéeing it is neceſſarie, that men ſtood, before
their fall: it followeth, that God ordeined the creation of
man in righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, from the which he
fell by ſinne. Therefore, the creation of man, his corruption,
his election, & his reprobation are ordeined of God.
                  To this argument I aunſwere: That to ordeine and
bring to paſſe is one thing: to foreknow in eternall counſell
another. God ordeined the creation of man to his
owne Image or likeneſſe, that he ſhould be righteous and
holie: & it was the fatherlie will of God, that his creature
ſhuld continue ſuch a one. He did foreknow yt man ſhuld
fall after Sathan had deceiued him, yet notwithſtanding
he ordeined not his fall: yea rather, this his fall was



contrarie to Gods ordinaunce, els had it not bene deadly
vnto man. But in ſo much as God foreknew mans diſcaſe,
he ordeined a remedie, to wit, his election after his fal
in Ieſus Chriſt.
                  Therefore, the foreknowledge of God is not the cauſe of
mans fall: but contrariewiſe, his fall which was to come,
was the cauſe of Gods foreknowledge. For the thing
dependeth not vpon knowledge, but knowledge vpon the
thing. Againe, we haue to vnderſtand, that the election of
God is eternall, and before all time: ſo that therein, in reſpect
of time, nothing is to be thought before or after. S.
Paule therefore when he ſaith (That God hath choſen vs
before the foundation of the world) ſpeaketh in reſpect of
vs, who are then in déede ſaid to bée elected, and choſen by
Gods eternall decrée, when we beleeue in Chriſt, and indeuour
to liue in holineſſe and innocencie.
                  Héerevpon it followeth, that the blaſphemous ſpeaches
of ſuch are execrable & accurſed which ſay: If I am elected
and choſen, why then mine iniquitie ſhall not condemne
mée, the counſell of God is vnchaungeable. If I be not elected
and choſen, why then neither faith, nor deſire to liue
vertuouſly will doe me any good. The manner of election
which is conditionall, confuteth theſe kinde of ſpeaches.
We are choſen in Chriſt, Ergo we are choſen vpon this
condition, if we be in Chriſt: that is, if we ſhall beleeue
in Chriſt. Wherefore he that is condemned is condemned
through his owne default, bicauſe when he was fallen, he
refuſed to take hold of Gods right hand, whoſe wil it was
to lift him vp againe. This is proued by the ende of the
miniſterie of the word. For God ſent the Apoſtles, & their
ſucceſſors alſo abroad to this end, That they ſhuld preach
the Goſpel, & that they which beleeued ſhould haue life
euerlaſting. Our ſaluation therfore out of doubt is conditional,Col. 1. 13.
as theſe words of Paule beare record, Si modo, &c.
If you continue grounded and ſtabliſhed in the faith.
Participes,
                     Heb. 3. 6. 
                     &c. We are made partakers of Chriſt, if we



hold faſt the confidence, and the reioicing of the hope
vnto the ende.

                     Mulier, &c. The woman ſhall bee ſaued,
if ſhe continue in faith. Si tamen, &c. If ſo be we ſhall
be ſound cloathed & not naked.
                     2. Cor. 5. 3. Chriſt in like caſe beateth
into our heads this condition,Ioh. 3. 18. 
                     Qui crediderit, &c. He
that beleeueth, ſhall not be condemned: but he that beleeueth
not,
                     Luke. 13. 5 
                     is condemned alreadie. Niſi, &c. Except yee
amend your liues,
                     Ioh. 15. 7. 
                     ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh. Si manſeritis,
&c. If ye abide in me, & my words abide in you,
aske what ye will, and it ſhall be done vnto you. Vpon
this ſimplicitie of Gods word, let vs ſtedfaſtlie ſtaie our
ſelues, neither let vs ſuffer our ſelues to be withdrawn
from it by anie ſophiſtrie: let vs giue to God the praiſe
of truth: and let vs be trulie reſolued in our ſelues, that
Gods will is to do that indéed, which he witneſſeth in his
word he will doe.
                  
                     But if we be not able to aunſwere to all the craftie
concluſions of Sophiſters, which wreſt the Scripture diuerſlie,
to mainteine & vphold their decrees of deſtinie:
let vs confeſſe, that we are but babes in the ſchoole of
Chriſt, and let vs hold faſt the grounds of godlines, which
we haue atteined vnto, by an vnfeined faith: neither let
theſe moſt ſweete and delicate ſaiengs be ſnatcht from
vs,
                     1. Tim. 1. 15. Fidelis ſermo, &c. This is a true ſaieng, and by all
meanes worthie to be receiued, that Chriſt Ieſus came into
the world to ſaue ſinners.1. Tim. 2. 3 4. 5. 6. 
                     Againe, Hoc honeſtum, &c.
This is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Sauiour,
who will that all men ſhall be ſaued, and come
vnto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God,
and one Mediatour betweene God and man, which is
the man Chriſt Ieſus, who gaue himſelfe a raunſome
for all men. And the Lord himſelfe ſaith, Venite, &c.
Come vnto me,Matth. 9. 13. all ye that labour & are heauie loaden
and I will refreſh you. And againe, Non veni, &c. I came
not into the world to call the righteous,2. Pet. 3. 9 but ſinners to
repentaunce. Againe, Deus eſt, &c. The Lord is patient



                     towards vs, & would haue no man periſh, but would
all men to come to repentaunce.
                     Rom. 10. 11. 12. Againe, Omnis, &c.
Whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhall not be aſhamed: for
there is no difference betweene the Iewe and the Grecian:
for he that is Lord ouerall, is rich vnto all that
call vpon him. Againe, Apparuit, &c. For the grace of
God,
                     Tit. 2. 11. 12. 13. 
                     which bringeth ſaluation vnto all men, hath appered:
& teacheth vs that we ſhould denie vngodlines, &
worldlie luſts, and that we ſhould liue ſoberlie & righteouſlie,
and godlie in this preſent world: looking for
the bleſſed hope & appearing of the glorie of the mightie
God, and of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. Theſe and ſuch
like ſaiengs let vs ſet againſt all ſophiſtrie, nothing regarding
the fowle language of ſophiſters, albeit they miſcall
vs at their pleaſure, tearming vs, fooles, dolts, blockheads,
aſſes, and otherwiſe as they liſt. Let Chriſt alone
be our wiſedome, who (as we know well inough) hated
all ſophiſtrie.
               
               
                  
                     5. 6. & 7. Verſes.
                  
                  
                     5 Who hath predeſtinate vs,
to bee adopted through Ieſus
Chriſt vnto himſelfe, according
to the good pleaſure of his vvil,
                     6 To the praiſe of the glorie
of his grace, vvhervvith he hath
made vs accepted in his beloued,
                     7 By vvhom vve haue redemption,
through his bloud, euen
the forgiuenes of ſinnes, according
to his rich grace.
                  
                  VVho hath predeſtinate vs
vnto the adoption of his children,
through Ieſus Chriſt vnto
himſelfe, according to the good
pleſure of his will, to the praiſe
of his glorie & grace, whereby
he hath made vs acceptable in
the beloued, in whom we haue
redemption by his bloud, euen
the remiſſion of ſinnes, according
to the riches of his grace.
                  THis is an expoſition, or rather a certeine notable, &
excellent repetition of the laſt reaſon, with greater
weight of things & words, & alſo a noting of circūſtances.
For in this place ye Apoſtle fetcheth further, & beateth vpō
that, which before he had ſpoken, heaping vp ſuch things



together, as ſéemed to make the more for the plaine proofe
of the matter. Now, that we may the better drawe out
ſuch treaſure, as is ſtored vp in this part, and applie the
ſame to our vſe, let vs lay it downe in points, and let vs
conſider and examine euerie particular member by it
ſelfe ſeuerallie, and weight them throughlie, and (as they
ſay) to the proofe.
                  
                     Of this part, there are eight members,
which thus followe in order.
                     IN the firſt place he maketh mention, of the verie:
foundation or principall cauſe of our ſpirituall bleſſing,
that is to ſay, of our ſaluation, namelie predeſtination:
wherby God had a foreknowledge of their ſaluation
(euen before the world was made) which ſhuld beléeue in
Ieſus Chriſt. For as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt alone, is the
matter of our election, ſo is he alſo of our predeſtination.
                     In the ſecond place he ſetteth downe the forme or
manner of predeſtination: to wit, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        : that is to
ſay, adoption: whereby we are adopted into the ſonnes,
which were before, through ſinne, the ſonnes of wrath.
This predeſtinate adoption, is applied vnto vs by faith,
according to that ſaieng of the Apoſtle.Ioh. 1. 12. 
                        Poteſtatem dedit,
&c. He hath giuen power to them that beleeue in him,
to be the ſonnes of God. Now, ſeeing God, by the preaching
of the Goſpell, calleth (all men) vnto faith, there is
no doubt but Gods will is indéed, that (all men) ſhould be
ſaued. For, farre be it from the mindes of the godlie, to
haue ſuch a thought: namelie, that the heart of him which
hath mercie differeth from the voice of him which calleth.
                     In the third place, becauſe it is come to paſſe through
the ſinne of our firſt parents, and by our owne default,
that we are eſtraunged from God and put backe a farre
off from Gods houſhold, the Apoſtle ſheweth a meane,
whereby we are ioined to God againe, receiued into his



houſholde, and adopted for his ſonnes. This remedie or
meane is Ieſus Chriſt, the onelie Mediatour of God
and men, who is apprehended and taken holde vpon by
faith in the preaching of the Goſpell, wherein the holie
Ghoſt is effectuall and mightie in working. Héere all merites
of men, which make nothing for our ſaluation, are
manifeſtlie ouerthrowne and laid along: likewise all prerogatiue
and boaſting of the fleſh is héere confounded,
That he which glorieth,
                        1. Cor. 1. 31 
                        might glorie in the Lord, in
whom we are both elect and predeſtinate.
                     In the fourth place he expreſſeth the compelling cauſe
of this excellent grace and adoption: namelie, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
that is to ſay, the bountifull, liberall, and
fatherlie affection, or entier loue of our heauenlie father
towards mankinde. This good will and loue of God, the
Angels blaze abroad at the birth of Chriſt,Luke. 1. 14 ſaieng: Gloria,
&c. Glorie to God on high, in earth peace, & toward
men good will. The verie ſame hath our heauenlie Father
himſelfe teſtified from heauen,Math. 3. 4▪ 17. & 17. 5 
                        Hic eſt, &c.
This is my beloued ſonne, in whom I am well pleaſed,
that is to ſay, in whom I am become bountifull and fauourable
towards mankinde to worke his ſaluation. Let
vs therefore take héede, that we ſéeke not the good pleaſure
and will of God towards vs elſewhere, than in Ieſus
Chriſt alone, becauſe in him, without all doubt, we
ſhall finde the ſame by faith.
                     In the fift place, the laſt ende of our adoption is added,
which is thriſe repeated in this Chapter: to wit,
That the glorie of his grace might be praiſed. For as
our adoption is from God, ſo muſt the ſame be referred
to God, that his goodneſſe might be praiſed and magnified
through Ieſus Chriſt. This end is not to be ſeparated
from the grace of adoption: whereby manifeſtlie appeareth,
how neceſſarie new obedience is, in them which
are regenerate and borne againe by faith. For
héerein conſiſteth new obedience, that we ſhould glorifie



God in our minde, in our heart, in our voice, in our
works, and (to be ſhort) in our whole life. Let them
therefore be aſhamed of their follie, which teach, that the
good works of Chriſtians, are not onely not neceſſarie,
but alſo hurtfull vnto men.
                     In the fift place, he declareth from whence, and out
of what fountaine that fatherlie good will and grace of
God towards vs doth flow, when he ſaith: (Wherewith
he hath made vs accepted in his beloued▪
                        ) This beloued
Ieſus Chriſt, is that fountaine, out of which that exceeding
great grace of God towards vs doth iſſue: where vpon
that falleth out iump which we noted before, that none
ſhall be partaker of this grace, but they which lay hands
vpon this beloued ſonne of God by faith.
                     In the ſeuenth place, ſome thing is ſaid of redemption:
to wit, That the beloued ſonne of God hath redéemed
vs by his bloud, and waſhed away our ſinnes, that
how many of vs ſo euer reſt vpon him with a ſtedfaſt
faith, might appeare iuſt and righteous in the ſight of
God.
                     In the eight place, the principall cauſe of our redemption,
wrought by Ieſus Chriſt, is touched, where it is
ſaid, (According to the riches of his grace:) that is to ſay,
according to the euerlaſting & vnſpeakable grace of God,
whereby he would that his beloued ſonne ſhould be made
a cleanſing ſacrifice for the ſinnes of men: that the iuſtice
of God, by that meanes might be ſatiſfied, and that place
might be left for his mercie. (The riches of his grace)
doe ſignifie, (after the Hebrew phraſe) Gods vnmeaſurable,
bottomleſſe, and euerlaſting grace (as I ſaid euen
now:) which manner of ſpeach the Apoſtle vſeth vpon
eſpeciall reaſon, and ſingular purpoſe. Let vs therefore
conſider, not onely of what great price the bloud of Chriſt
is in the ſight of God: but alſo, how great the abundance
of Gods grace is, flowing from the ſame: leaſt any ſhould
thinke, that this grace of God ſtretcheth it ſelfe but to a



few: or that it is all ſpent long agoe, conſidering the degrees
of ages paſt, and by that meanes, not to be ſufficient
for the cleanſing of our ſinnes, vpon whom the end of the
world is come.
                     See how richly ſtored this ſhort point is, with moſt
excellent and heauenlie things. Wherefore let the ſame
be diligently learned, & each ſeueral word therof throughly
conſidered. For, the myſterie of our ſaluation is no
where, either more briefly, or more fitly deſcribed.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 8. 9. &. 10.
                  
                  
                     8 Whereby hee hath bene abundant
towards vs, in all vviſdome
and vnderſtanding.
                     9 And hath opened vnto vs
the myſterie of his vvill, according
to his good pleaſure,
vvhich he had purpoſed in him.
                     10 That in the diſpenſation
of the fulneſſe of the times, hee
might gather together in one,
all things, both vvhich are in
heauen, and vvhich are in earth,
euen in Chriſt.
                  
                  VVhich grace he hath ſhed
vpon vs abundantly in all wiſdome
and prudence, in making
knowne vnto vs the myſterie
of his will, according to
his good pleaſure, which hee
purpoſed in himſelfe, to haue
it declared when the time
was full come to gather together
all things in Chriſt,
both the things which are in
heauen, and alſo the things
which are in earth, euen in
him.
                  LET the trim order of Paules words be marked. Hetherto
he hath handled the cauſes of our bleſſing and
ſaluation wonderfully, both with weightie words and
matter. Now he commeth to the inſtrument, whereby
that ſpirituall grace is reuealed, offered, and communicated
vnto vs: namely, to the verie miniſterie of the
worde, of which miniſterie he ſpeaketh, not after a common
manner, but déeplie and diuinelie, euen to this
ende, that he might kindle in vs a greater zeale of this
heauenly grace. The ſumme of this point, therefore
is this. That the Apoſtle teacheth, that the grace of God
which bringeth ſaluatiō to all men, is plentifully powred
vpon vs by the Goſpell, according to the good pleaſure of



God, that at the length all might bée gathered againe in
Chriſt. Now let vs throughly cōſider the ſeuerall words.
In the firſt place ye Apoſtle vſeth this word (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                     to abound) whereby thoſe riches of Gods grace are ſignified,
wherof he ſpake before: that we might know, that the
grace of God is ſufficient to ſaue all men. For the fountaine
of grace is neuer drawn ſo drie, but euerie one may
fetch frō it to ſerue their turne, ſo they carrie faith with
them: neither can the ſins of men be ſo many & ſo great,
but they may be ouerwhelmed & drowned in the floud
flowing from this fountaine, ſo that men ſéeke to get into
Noes Arke, that is to ſay, into the houſhold of God, by the
faith of Chriſt. Let no man therfore deſpaire for ye greatneſſe
& multitude of his ſins, but whiles the time of grace
yet laſteth, let him earneſtly repent, & flie vnto him for
ſuccour who crieth out, That he came into ye world to ſaue
ſinners, & to receiue the repentant into grace & fauour.
                  He addeth the effect or fruit of the Goſpell in the hearers:
to wit, that thereby they are inſtructed (In all wiſdome
and vnderſtanding.) For ſo doth the old Interpretour,
and Eraſmus, tranſlate the words verie well. Now
theſe words are rightly diſcerned, if we referre wiſdome
(
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) to knowledge: and vnderſtanding (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     )
to practiſe. For theſe two things we muſt fetch from the
preaching of the Goſpell. Wiſedome therefore ſignifieth
the knowledge of the Goſpell, that is ſay, the knowledge
of God, and of all thoſe things which are néedfull to be
knowne for the obtaining of ſaluation. Vnderſtanding,
being the gouerneſſe of all our purpoſes and enterpriſes,
applieth that knowledge to the framing of our life, and
practiſing of that which is good: that we may abound, not
onely in knowledge, but alſo in iudgement, as the Apoſtle
ſaith to the Philippians.
                     Philip. 1. 9. Out of this effect or fruit of
the Goſpell, theſe ſpecialties following may be gathered.
                  The firſt, that the preaching of the Goſpell is the reuelation
of Gods grace towards mankinde: & alſo of his



election, whereby he choſe vs in Chriſt.
                  The ſecond, that the perfect wiſdome and vnderſtanding
of Gods children is contained in the Goſpell, ſo much
as is ſufficient for the obtaining of ſaluation.
                  The third, which is concluded vpon the two former,
that it is lawfull for Gods children, to ſet light by and to
haue in contempt, without feare, all doctrines of men and
Angels contrarie to the Goſpell,Gal. 1. 8. yea, to count them accurſed,
according to that ſaieng, Let him bee accurſed
which preacheth anie other Goſpell.
                  
                  Furthermore, whereas the Apoſtle preſently addeth,
(And hath opened vnto vs the myſterie of his will, according
to his good pleaſure) he commendeth yet againe
the Goſpell vnto vs, in which commendation thrée things
are principally to be marked.
                  Firſt, that he calleth the Goſpell, a myſterie: that is to
ſay, a ſecreat: wherevpon it followeth, that it is not the
wiſdome of mans reaſon, but of heauenlie grace. For if
the reaſon of man could reach vnto it, Paule would not
haue called it a myſterie. A reaſon why he calleth it by
ſuch a name,Rom. 16 25. 26. is expreſſed in his Epiſtle to the Romans,
in theſe words: Iuxta Euangelium, &c. According to
my Goſpell, and preaching of Ieſus Chriſt, by the reuelation
of the myſterie, which was kept ſecreat ſince the
world began: But now is opened and publiſhed among
all nations, by the Scriptures of the Prophets, at the
commaundement of the euerlaſting God, for the obedience
of faith.
                  
                  Secondly, that the Goſpell is the myſterie of Gods
will, according to his good pleaſure? But what is that
will of good pleaſure in God? That all nations might beléeue,
and obey the Goſpell. For ſo we taught euen now
out of the Apoſtles words.
                  Now, in that the euent or ſucceſſe is not aunſwerable
to the will of Gods good pleaſure, the default is in
men, who (to their owne deſtruction) maliciouſly refuſe



ſaluation fréely offered. Therefore, the preaching of grace
if thou looke to the purpoſe of God, and his good pleaſure,
is vniuerſall, and ſtretcheth vnto all. But if thou conſider
the euent or ſucceſſe, it ſéemeth to be particular, & to reach
but to ſome, which (doubtleſſe) commeth to paſſe through
mans owne fault, not through the appointment of God
which created him,1. Tim. 2. 4. & gaue his ſonne to redéeme him. For
God in deede would haue all men ſaued, and come to the
knowledge of the truth: as we haue ſhewed before at
large, where we declared that our election was cōditional.
                  Thirdly, that the Apoſtle maketh the good pleaſure of
God the Father, the cauſe of the reuelation of this myſterie,
as before he made it the cauſe of our election and
predeſtination. Whereby we are admoniſhed, that wée
muſt iudge of our election and predeſtination by our calling:
which calling, ſéeing it is as well vniuerſall, according
to yt ſaieng: Ite in vniuerſum, &c. Go ye throughout
the whole world, and preach the Goſpell vnto euerie
creature, (whiles he nameth (euerie creature), he taketh
away the difference of people and perſons:) as alſo conditionall,
namely, the condition of faith, according to that
ſaieng: Qui credident, &c. He that beleeueth ſhall be ſaued:
therefore ſhall election and predeſtination be likewiſe
conditionall, which are not to bée ſeparated from
Chriſt, who is the matter of them both.
                  Now followeth a double circumſtance of this good pleaſure
of God, the firſt is, of the time of the reuelation of the
myſterie of the Goſpell: the ſecond iſ, of the ende of the
reuelation. For when he ſaith (In the diſpenſation of the
fulneſſe of the times) he ſignifieth, that the good pleaſure
of God was then reuealed, when the time was come,
which God had appointed with himſelfe. Now, this time,
as it was marked of the Patriarch Iacob with a ſpeciall
ſigne & token: ſo was it noted of Daniel the Prophet with
a certaine bound & limit.Gen. 49. 1
                           •
                        . 
                     Iacob ſaith, Non auferetur, &c.
The ſcepter ſhall not depart from Iudah, vntill Shilo



come: that is to ſay, The ſeed promiſed to our forefathers.
Daniel reckoneth thrée ſcore & ten wéekes of the yeares
from the captiuitie of Babylon,
                     Dan. 9. 24 vntill the comming of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Of this time ſpeaketh Paule, ſaiing:Gal. 4. 4. 5
                     Quando vent, &c. When the fulneſſe of time was
come, God ſent foorth his ſonne made of a woman, and
made vnder the law, that he might redeeme them which
were vnder the lawe. The word (Diſpenſation) which
Paule vſeth in this place, is called in Gréeke 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
of which word there is a double vſe. For one while (and
that according to the Etymologie or right propertie of the
ſame) it ſignifieth a care or charge, & good ordering of an
houſe and houſhold. An other while (but Metaphoricallie,
or by tranſlation,) it ſignifieth a diſpoſing and fit framing
of things which are to be done: or, a certaine kéeping of
order in handling of matters.
                  The ſecond circumſtance is of the ende of the reuelation
of Gods good pleaſure, which is (To gather together
in one, all things euen in Chriſt.) The Greeke word

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which Saint Paule vſeth, doth
ſignifie, to ioine together into one bodie as it were, things
ſet a ſunder and ſcattered, and to knit them to one head.
For the Subſtantiue 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , (from the which the
Verbe is deriued) is (as it were) a certain ſummarie, & a
gathering together of ſundrie parts in one whole bodie.
The Apoſtle therefore meaneth, that creatures, which
were ſcattered, are gathered together in one, through Ieſus
Chriſt, that béeing gathered together, they might bée
all vnder one head. The diuiſion following comprehendeth
the whole Church. (Which are (ſaith he) in heauen)
that is to ſay, the holie Angels, and beléeuers, which departed
this life, before the ſonne of God tooke fleſh of the
Virgin: (And which are in earth,) that is to ſaie, all
ſuch as doe beléeue, and ſhall beléeue in Chriſt, alreadie
reuealed and come into the world, ſhall be vnder one
head, as it were a bodie conſiſting of many and ſundrie



members. Héere we are put in minde of faith, whereby
we are knit vnto Chriſt our head: and of loue, wherby we
are coupled in brotherhoode one with an other. This
brotherhood or fellowſhip, is commended vnto vs by the
Sacraments of the Church. Baptiſme beareth witneſſe
that we are baptiſed into one bodie. The ſupper of the
Lord, is a token of ye Communion which we haue with
Chriſt: & it is a certaine teſtimonial & aſſured warrant of
ſpiritual fraternitie and felowſhip betwéene our ſelues.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 11. &. 12
                  
                  
                     11 In whom alſo we are choſen,
vvhen vvee vvere predeſtinate,
according to the purpoſe
of him, vvhich vvorketh all
things, after the counſell of his
ovvne vvill.
                     12 That vve vvhich firſt truſted
in Chriſt, ſhould bee vnto
the praiſe of his glorie.
                  
                  In whom alſo we are choſen, being
predeſtinate according to
the purpoſe of him which worketh
all things according to the
counſell of his will, that wee
which before hoped in Chriſt,
ſhould be vnto the praiſe of his
glorie.
                  THus farre the Apoſtle hath ſpoken of all the elected
and choſen in Chriſt generallie: now by diſtribution
he applieth the generalitie, vnto two ſpecialties: and firſt
he toucheth the Iewes, declaring that they are made partakers
of heauenlie grace. And he ſetteth downe in order
three cauſes of this heauenlie grace: to wit, the efficient,
the finall, and the inſtrumentall cauſe.
                  Hée ſheweth the efficient cauſe, when he ſaith, (Predeſtinate
according to the purpoſe of him.) Concerning
this cauſe, read that which we haue noted before
alreadie.
                  He addeth the finall cauſe, (That we ſhould bee vnto
the praiſe of his glorie,) that is to ſaie, that God himſelfe
might be praiſed for the greatneſſe of his grace and
mercie ſhewed vnto vs.
                  He ioineth héer vnto ye inſtrument, when he ſaith, (That
we which firſt hoped or truſted in Chriſt.) For vnder ye
name of hope, he doth in this place comprehend faith alſo.



Now, whereas I expound that of faith, which is héere ascribed
to hope, therein is no obscuritie or hardneſſe. For,
as faith is oftentimes taken for hope, ſo is hope taken for
faith, by reaſon of a mutuall conſequence, or following
one of an other. For that, which faith laieth hold vpon &
poſſeſſeth preſently, that doth hope looke and waite for to
come héereafter. Theſe thrée cauſes of grace the Apoſtle
ſetteth downe in this place, which grace, (as before he called
it Gods bleſſing, or his adoption:) ſo héere it may be vnderſtood
by this word (Choſen) or choice: euen to this end,
that we may know it is Gods frée gift. For it goeth not
by lot that man is choſen, but it is the will of God which
offereth ſaluation fréely vnto all. Now, where he addeth,
(Which worketh all things after the counſell of his owne
will) he giueth vs a double doctrine, or leſſon to learne.
The firſt is, that God is not tied (according to the deſtinie
of the Stoikes) to ſecond cauſes, but at frée & full libertie
to doe what hée liſt. For hee, which by his counſell can,
and by his power will do, is not compelled by any manner
of neceſſitie at all to doe this or that. For things depending
vpon neceſſitie, are neither gouerned by counſell,
nor diſpensed withall by will. The ſecond is, that
God worketh in his Church all things that are wholeſome
and good: and nothing that is euill, or commeth of
ſinne: as ſome out of this place vnaduiſedly conclude, ſaieng:
He that ſaith all things, excludeth nothing. But their
reaſon is ouerthrown by the Apoſtles words. For if God
worketh all things by the counſell of his will: & his will
be moſt holie, & ſo good as nothing better, intending nothing
that is euill in anie reſpect,Pſal. 5, 4. as the Pſalmist moſt
plainly pronounceth, Non volens, &c. Thou art a God
which canſt not away with iniquitie: truly it cannot be
that God ſhuld be the author of ſin, or of anie euill procéeding
of a fault. Laſtly, ye circumſtance of the place reſtraineth
yt vniuerſal word (all things) to one certeine kinde of
action or déede. For ye text hangeth thus together, (Which



worketh all things, that we ſhould be vnto the praiſe of
his glorie,) that is to ſay, he bringeth to paſſe, that we
both wil & do thoſe things, which turne to the glorie and
praiſe of God. The Apoſtle therefore ſpeaketh manifeſtlie,
of the wholſome or healthful workings of God in his
Church. For he moueth our will, that we may will, and
our ſtrength, that we may not will in waſte.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 13, &. 14
                  
                  
                     13 In vvhom alſo ye haue truſted,
after that ye heard the
vvord of truth, euen the goſpel
of your ſaluation, wherein alſo,
after that ye beleeued, ye vvere
ſealed with the holie ſpirit of
promiſe.
                     14 Which is the earneſt of our
inheritance, vntill the redemption
of the poſſeſſion purchaſed
vnto the praiſe of his glory.
                  
                  In whom alſo ye (hauing
heard the word of truth,
euen the Goſpell of your
ſaluation, wherein ye beleeued,)
were ſealed with
the holie ſpirit of promiſe,
which is the earneſt of our
inheritaunce, vnto redemption,
to the praiſe of his glorie.
                  THis is an other member of our diuiſion, wherein
he applieth the partaking of heauenlie grace, ſpirituall
bleſſing, adoption, and election with the Saints, vnto
the Gentiles, vnder the name of the Epheſians, drawing
his argument from the effect or fruit of the Goſpell preached
among the Epheſians. But becauſe this part is
verie full of ſpirituall doctrine, I will lay it open, and
declare it in his proper members, to the intent that the
doctrine may the more plainlie be perceiued, and made to
ſerue our vſe.
                  In the firſt place mention is made of the preaching
of the Goſpell, whereby God reuealeth vnto the world
his will touching ſaluation fréelie giuen, and offereth the
ſame indifferentlie vnto all,Marke. 16. 15. without reſpect of perſon or
people, according to that ſaieng, Goe ye throughout the



whole world, and preach the Goſpell vnto euerie creature.
                  
                  In the ſecond place followeth faith, which being conceiued
in vs by the Goſpell preached, the holie Ghoſt
working effectually in our hearts, laieth faſt holde vpon
the ſaluation which the Goſpell offereth, giuing vnto
God the praiſe of his truth.
                  In the third place is added the ſealing of the
holie ſpirit, wherewith we are then ſaied to be ſeaſed,
when we bring forth the true fruites of faith, by the
faith of Ieſus Chriſt. This holie ſpirit, the Apoſtle calleth
(The ſpirit of promiſe,) both bicauſe it ſealeth vnto
vs the good things promiſed, and alſo bicauſe it is giuen
vs by promiſe.
                  In the fourth place is added the vſe of this holie ſpirite
giuen vnto vs: namelie, (That it ſhould be the
earneſt of our inheritance:) which we doe not yet perfectlie
poſſeſſe, but looke & waite for the ſame, héerafter to
come. For as that is an earneſt, when ſome thing of the
price is giuen, which is not to be drawen backe againe,
but to be perfourmed and fullie downe paid: ſo the giuing
of the holie ſpirit, is a certaine part of our inheritaunce,
beſtowed vpon vs, for this ende: to wit, that we
might be aſſured of the full and perfect poſſeſſion of the
whole inheritaunce, which is euerlaſting life. And why
is it called an inheritance, but becauſe it pleaſed God, of
his fatherlie goodneſſe, without our merites, to appoint
the ſame our portion, which are made the members of
Chriſt the naturall ſonne of God, vnto whom all things,
which are his fathers, doe belong.
                  In the fift place the circumſtaunce of time is noted,
(Vntill the redemptiō of the poſſeſſiō purchaſed,) ſaith
the Apoſtle: that is to ſay, vntill the day of iudgement,
when we which are redéemed with the price of Chriſts
bloud, ſhall obtaine and enioie our full inheritance. (Vntill
the redemption) therefore, that is to ſay, vntill the



day of redemption: (Of the poſſeſſion purchaſed,) that
is to ſay, for vs, who by our redemption wrought in his
bloud, are put in poſſeſſion of the promiſed inheritance.
                  Hetherto we haue vntwiſted, as it were, and laid open
this preſent point, in his proper parts or members: in
the which our Apoſtle ſetteth out verie trimlie, the manner
and order of our reſtitution or redemption. For he
beginneth at the preaching of the Goſpell, and teacheth
vs, that faith muſt be added therevnto: which being
done, the ſealing of the holie ſpirit is felt in the heart,
which is a certaine earneſt as it were of the promiſed inheritance.
The laſt end of all theſe, is the glorie of God,
of his mercie healing, and alſo ſauing all ſuch as beléeue.
For (saith Saint Ambroſe) as it is ye Phyſicians praiſe
and commendation, if he heale manie: ſo the praiſe of
Gods glorie is, when manie are wonne to beléeue with
vnfeigned faith. Finallie, we muſt marke, that the Apoſtle
decketh the Goſpell of Chriſt with a double title.
For firſt, by the figure Antonomaſia, he calleth the Gospell
(The word of truth:) which title is taken of the
matter conteined in the Goſpell. For the Goſpell doeth
conteine the euerlaſting truth of God, & an vndeceiuable
teſtimonie of obteining ſaluation through Chriſt. The ſecond
is, (The Goſpell of ſaluation,) which is taken of the
end of the Goſpell. For the Goſpell was ordeined and giuen
for our ſaluation. For, as the Law, whiles it requireth
righteouſneſſe, promiſeth ſaluation and life to them
which fulfill the ſame: & contrariwiſe, threateneth damnation
& death to all the tranſgreſſours thereof: ſo the
Goſpell, becauſe we haue not the righteouſnes which the
Lawe requireth, ſheweth Chriſt vnto vs, who is ye end of
the Law to all them that beléeue. Thus ye righteouſnes &
ſaluation, which we could not reach vnto in doing, we obteine
in beléeuing, whiles ye righteouſnes of Chriſt being
imputed vnto vs, & our ſins waſhed away by ye ſacrifice
of himſelf, we are made righteous, & heires alſo of ſaluation.



Neither is this ſlightlie to be ouerſlipped, that as
before he made the glorie of God the end of our election,
of our predeſtination, and likewiſe of our calling: ſo héere
alſo, he maketh the ſame the ende of our ſanctification.
Wherevpon it followeth, that all glorie of ſaluation,
muſt be taken quite away from euerie creature, and merite
of man, and giuen to God alone by Ieſus Chriſt.
Wherefore, as in all things that are good, ſo héere chiefelie
that ſhort ſentence of Nazianzen taketh place, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
that is to ſay, Make
God the beginning and ende of euerie thing.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 15, &. 16.
                  
                  
                     15 Therefore alſo, after that I
heard of the faith, vvhich ye
haue in the Lord Ieſus, & loue
towards all Saints,
                     16 I ceaſe not to giue thanks
for you, making mention of
you in my praiers.
                  
                  For this cauſe I alſo hauing heard
of your faith in the Lord Ieſus, &
your loue towards all the Saints,
ceaſe not to giue thankes for you,
making mention of you in my
praiers.
                  THe Apoſtle hauing reckoned vp the benefites of God
beſtowed vpon mankinde, doth ſhew, what the thinking
vpon theſe benefites wrought in himſelfe: namelie,
a mouing and ſtirring of him vp to giue God thankes,
who is the Authour and fountaine of ſo great good. It is
méete that this deede of the Apoſtle, ſhould be vnto vs a
rule well worthie the marking, throughout the whole
courſe of our life: that the remembraunce and calling to
accompt of Gods good gifts and benefits, might ſtirre vs
vp to thankeſgiuing. For he which thinketh vpon Gods
benefites, or heareth them rehearſed or named, and burſteth
not foorth with an affection of heart into thankeſgiuing,
beſides that he is vnthankfull to God, and therfore
vnrighteous: ſo he deſerueth by his vnthankfulneſſe, to
be ſpoiled of all Gods graces. For, as in the poſſeſſion
of things, not onelie the right of poſſeſſing, but alſo the



lawfull vſing of them is required: ſo it is méete, that a
Chriſtian vſe thoſe graces, which he poſſeſſeth by the merite
of Chriſt, and therefore by good right, to the glorie of
God the giuer, with thankeſgiuing. Laſtlie, this place
teacheth, that this is a moſt right order: namelie, that
thankeſgiuing for benefits receiued goe before, and that
praier followe by and by at the foote thereof, wherein we
muſt craue of God, the kéeping of his benefits receiued,
and other healthfull gifts, good and neceſſarie. Furthermore,
this place teacheth vs, that the profiting of men in
godlineſſe, is the méere benefit of God. For, whiles
Paule giueth God thankes, that the Epheſians profit in
hope and charitie (or truſt and loue,) he acknowledgeth
that God is the Author of this good. For he, of his frée
goodnes, raiſeth vp good gouernours of Common wealths,
and ſendeth ſincere miniſters of the Goſpell: beſides
that, he is forceable in working by his ſpirit, in the hearts
of the hearers of his word, both whiles they are preſent
at the preaching thereof, and alſo otherwiſe exerciſed in
the ſame: bringing this to paſſe in them: namelie, that
they ſhould both beléeue and loue him. Moreouer, this
place teacheth, what be the principall duties of Chriſtians,
which he draweth vnto two heads, to wit, to ye faith
of Ieſus Chriſt, and to loue towards the Saints. Theſe
notwithſtanding ought ſo to be vnderſtood, that together
with them, all things which are naturallie ioined with
them: namelie, their neceſſarie effects or fruits be alſo
vnderſtood.
                  Faith therefore, when it hath hope ioined with it, inuocation
or calling vpon God, the feare of God, loue, patience,
and ſuch like, they are not giuen vnto vs, without
their fruites.
                  Semblablie, loue comprehendeth the duties of loue
towards all men.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Verſe. 17. & 18.
                  
                  
                     17 That the God of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, the Father of glorie,
might giue vnto you, the
ſpirit of vviſedome & reuelation,
through the knovvledge of
him,
                     18 That the eyes of your vnderſtanding
may be lightened.
                  
                  That the God of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, the Father of glorie,
might giue vnto you the
ſpirit of wiſedome and reuelation
in the knowledge of himſelfe,
& lighten the eies of your
minde.
                  THe Apoſtle declareth, what he wiſheth to the Epheſians
in his praiers: to wit, (The ſpirit of
wiſdome and reuelation, through the knowledge of Ieſus
Chriſt,) that is to ſay, a true knowledge of the myſterie
of the Goſpell, which the ſpirit reuealeth, when the
Goſpell is effectuall in the hearts of the hearers thereof,
and the meditaters therevpon. For ſéeing the Goſpell
guideth vs to the knowledge of Chriſt, who is the wiſedome
of his Father giuen vnto vs of God: we are alſo
poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of wiſedome, whereby the eies of
our minde are enlightened, to vnderſtand the myſterie
of the Goſpell. Now let vs ſée the circumſtaunces of the
Apoſtles praier. The firſt is, that he praieth vnto God,
who as he alone is the Authour of all good things: ſo he
alone is to be called vpon. The ſecond is, by and through
whom he praieth: this he ſheweth when he ſaith, (The
God of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:) as if he ſhould ſay: I
leane not to mine owne merites, but boldlie ſtaieng my
ſelf vpon the interceſſion, of Chriſt, I call vpon God. For
he alone is the Mediatour betwene God & men: & therfore
he himſelfe ſaid,1. Tim. 2. 5 
                     Quicquid, &c. Whatſoeuer ye ſhall
aske the Father in my name,
                     Math. 7. 7 16. 
                     he ſhall giue it you.
                  
                  
                     Athanaſius putteth theſe words (Of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt) in a Parentheſis,Mark. 11. 24. that glorie ſhould goe with the
word,Luke. 11. 9. 
                     God, and not with the word Father. But this is
pinched in too much,Iohn. 14. 13 & 15. 7. & 16. 24. or too ſtrait laced: let vs rather place
the words in this order, (The God of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, and Father of glorie.) For the Apoſtle ſéemeth
to haue an eie to the words of the Lord after he was raiſed



vp from the dead,Iohn. 20. 17. and ſpeaking in this manner, I aſcend
to my Father, and to your Father, to my God, and
to your God. Therefore was Chriſt borne a man, not
onelie that he might haue a common Father with vs, but
alſo a God: from whom the greateſt comfort of the faithfull
floweth. For thus doth faith conclude. The Father
and God of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, is likewiſe our Father
& God. Therfore, we are partakers of all heauenlie
benefits with Chriſt, our copartner. Therfore his will &
pleaſure is to doe vs good: and he both knoweth and alſo
can giue vs thoſe things, that are healthfull to ſerue for
our ſaluation. But how hangeth this together? What?
Is not the ſonne equall to the Father? As (doubtleſſe) he
is conſubſtantiall, ſo is he coequall with the Father: But
the ſonne abaſed himſelfe,
                     Phi. 2. 7. 8. 
                     putting on the ſtate and condition
of a ſeruant. And albeit it agréeth properlie with
the nature of man, that Chriſt ſhould be ſubiect vnto God
the Father: yet neuertheleſſe, that is referred to the verie
perſon, in reſpect of the vnitie of the perſon, bicauſe
Chriſt is both God & man. Furthermore, God is called
(The Father of glorie:) firſt, bicauſe all things are full of
his glorie: ſecondlie, bicauſe all glorie belongeth to him alone:
Laſtlie, bicauſe he is the Author & fountaine of all
glorie. Now the cauſe why Saint Paule in this place
giueth God this title, is this. He praieth vnto God, that
it would pleaſe him to giue the Epheſians the ſpirit of
wiſedome, &c. Which gift (doubtleſſe) both tendeth to the
glorie of God: and alſo bringeth to paſſe, that the Epheſians
are made partakers of heauenlie glorie. For it is a
common thing and much vſed in the ſcriptures, to giue
certeine titles vnto God, in conſideration of the matter
which is handeled. Wherevpon it followeth, that one
while he is called,2. Cor. 1. 3. 
                     Pater miſericordiarum, The Father of
mercies:
                     2. Cor. 1. 3. another while, Deus omnis conſolationis, The
God of all comfort:
                     Pſal. 88. 1. 
                     Deus ſalutis, The God of ſaluation:
Deus pacis & dilectionis,
                     2. Cor. 13. 11. 
                     The God of peace & loue. Of



this kinde there are manie examples in the Pſalmes of
Dauid,
                     Pſal. 17. 1 as when it is ſaid, Dominus fortitudo, &c. The
Lord is my ſtrength,
                     Pſal. 43. 2 
                     and the horne of my health. Againe,
Dominus,
                     Pſal. 118. 14. 
                     &c. The Lod is my rocke. Againe, Deus, &c. God is my refuge & my ſtrength. Againe, Deus,
&c. The Lord is a God of vengeaunce, the Lord is a
God of iudgement.
                  
                  It ſhall be good and profitable for vs, to followe and
kéepe this order in our praiers. For it is much materiall
and auailable, to ſtirre vp and quicken our mindes as
we are a praieng.
                  The third circumſtance is, that Saint Paule wiſheth
healthfull things to the faithfull Epheſians in Chriſt: to
wit, (The ſpirit of wiſedome and reuelation, and the
enlightning of the eyes of their minde,) that they might
knowe Chriſt. This circumſtaunce admoniſheth the miniſters
of the word of their dutie: namelie, that they
ought not onlie to teach their hearers healthfull things,
but alſo to wiſh them healthfull things.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 18. 19. & 20.
                  
                  
                     18 That ye may knovve vvhat
is the hope of his calling, and
vvhat is the riches of his glorious
inheritaunce in the Saints,
19 And what is the exceeding
greatnes of his povver tovvards
vs, vvhich beleeue, according to
the vvorking of his mightie
povver,
                     20 Which he vvrought in
Chriſt.
                  
                  That ye may know what is
the hope of his calling, & what
be the riches of the loue of his
inheritaunce in the Saints, and
what is the ſuperexcellent great
neſſe of his power to vs ward,
which beleeue according to the
working of the power of the
might which he hath wrought
in Chriſt.
                  THe Apoſtle declareth to what ende (The ſpirit of
wiſedome and reuelation) which he wiſheth to the
Epheſians, perteineth vnto wit, & knowledge, that they
might vnderſtand, how great that treaſure of heauenlie
grace is, which they obtaine in Chriſt.
                  
                     
And he vſeth in this place a figure of Rhetorike, called
Expolitio, both to amplifie & inlarge the thing: & alſo, that
this treaſure may the better be valued, (as much as may
be) according to the price and worthineſſe of the ſame. In
the firſt place he wiſheth, that the Epheſians may know
(What is the hope of their vocation or calling:) that is
to ſaie, that they might vnderſtand, how notable, precious,
and excellent, thoſe heauenlie graces are, which Chriſt
ſetteth foorth in his Goſpell, and to the which, ſuch as beléeue
are called. In the word (Hope) is contained a figure
called Metonymia. For (Hope) in this place is taken for
the thing whereto it is applied, that is to ſaie, for the
thing hoped.Gal. 5. 5. So the Apoſtle to the Galathians, calleth
hoped righteouſnes, The hope of righteouſneſſe, whereby
we are made like vnto God in all eternitie or euerlaſtingneſſe,
after we haue departed this life in true faith
and Chriſtian calling. The hope therefore of our calling,
is that happineſſe, wherevnto the Goſpell calleth vs.
                  This hope the Apoſtle expoundeth, ſaieng: (And what is
the riches of his glorious inheritaunce) that is to ſaie,
That ye may know how great and ineſtimable that glorious
inheritaunce of the children of God is: namely, of
them which beléeue the Goſpell.
                  Héerevnto is added an amplification or enlargement
drawn from the cauſe (And what is the exceeding greatneſſe
of his power, towards vs which beleeue:) as if hée
ſhould haue ſaid, We obtaine not that treaſure of heauenlie
graces by our owne ſtrength & abilitie, or by our
owne merits and deſerts: but by the power of God. Neither
muſt we idley paſſe ouer that, where he ſaith, (Towards
vs which beleeue.) For he meaneth, that faith
is the inſtrument, whereby wée receiue and poſſeſſe this
treaſure, the holy ſpirit béeing an aſſured earneſt of the
ſame, as we haue declared before.
                  And where he addeth, (According to the working of
his mightie power) that is done for vehemencie and force



ſake, that we might be quickned, earneſtly to cōſider what
the cauſe ſhould bée, from whence ſo great a treaſure of
ſaluation doth come: and that we might not, either by
ſlouthfulneſſe, or miſtruſtfulneſſe ware faintharted and
wearie, to goe forward in the courſe or race which we
haue begun.
                  The words Robur, Potentia, & Efficacia, in Engliſh,
Power, Might, and Working, ſerue to none other
ende, but to teach vs that the power of God cannot
bée ouercome, whereby as he is able to do what he will:
ſo he will giue to them that beléeue, the treaſure promiſed
in Chriſt, in due time: of which thing he ſetteth
downe a certaine token, ſaieng: (Which he wrought in
Chriſt,) that is to ſaie, which power God declared in
Chriſt: as if he ſaid, God ſhewed no ſmall ſigne of his
power in Chriſt your head, whoſe members ſéeing you
are, he will glorifie you, which beléeue, with the like
power.
                  The words, Robur, Potentia, & Efficacia, are thus diſtinguiſhed,
and diſcerned, the one from the other. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
Robur, is of nature, and is properly, actiuitie or might.

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Potentia, that is power or abilitie, hath reſpect
vnto the things whereto they are applied. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
Efficacia, that is, efficacie or working, is the effect of
both. Some make the difference thus, that Robur is as
it were the root, Potentia the trée, and Efficacia the fruit.
                  Out of this place of the Apoſtle, let vs learne to ſette
the power of God, both againſt the miſtruſtfulneſſe of
our fleſh, and alſo againſt the arguments of fooliſh reaſon,
wherewith the diuell bewitching mens mindes,
would withdraw vs from the hope of our calling, which
we haue in Chriſt Ieſus.

hand in the heauenlie places,
                     
                        
21 Farre aboue all principalitie,
and povver, and might, and

onelie, but alſo in that vvhich is

                     22 And hath made all things
ſubiect vnder his feet, & hath
appointed him ouer all things,
to be the head of the Church,
                     23 Which is his bodie, euen the
fulneſſe of him that filleth all in
all things.
                  
                  VVhiles he raiſed him from
the dead, and made him ſit at
his right hand in heauenlie
things, aboue all principalitie
(or rule) & power, & might,
and dominion (or Lordſhip) and
aboue all names that are named,
not onelie in this world,
but alſo in the world to come,
and hath put all things vnder
his feete, & ſet him aboue all
things, euen the head of the
Church, which is his bodie, and
the fulneſſe of him that filleth
all in all.
                  WHat maner of working the excéeding power of
God hath, which ye Apoſtle ſaith, God hath wrought
in Chriſt, he declareth by a verie trim diuiſion, wherein
the glorie of Chriſt triumphing is ſet before our eyes: and
the principall points of our faith in Chriſt are recited, the
expoſition whereof more at large, is to be fetcht out of
other places of holie Scripture.
                  Now, to the intent we may effectuallie applie euerie
thing to the ſtirring vp and confirming of our faith, wee
will laie it downe in partes, and diuide this concluſion
into ſeuen partes or members: then will wée ſhew, and
that brieflie, what our faith may gather out of them ſeuerally.
                  The firſt member is declared in theſe words, (When
he raiſed him from the dead,) that is to ſaie, God, in raiſing
his ſonne from the dead, ſhewed the working of his
excéeding power.Ioh. 19. 33 Of this firſt member, there are thrée
points. The firſt, of the Lordes death. The ſecond, of his
reſurrection. The third, of the power whereby he was
raiſed.Iohn. 20. 1. 2. &c. Of theſe thrée pointes wée will giue you a verie
ſhort admonition The hiſtorie of the Lords death, is well
knowne by ye writings of the Prophets, ye Apoſtles, & the
Creeds. But ye power & working therof is diligentlie to be
diſtinguiſhed & ſundered, frō the paſſions or ſufferings, &



the deaths of other Saints or holie men. For the paſſions
or ſufferings, and the deaths of other Saints, were either
martyrdoms, or trials of their faith and confeſſion:
or els, as for example in the théefe, certaine puniſhments
for offences. But the death and paſſion of Chriſt is farre
otherwiſe to be conſidered, which Chriſt himſelfe defineth
to be ſanctification, that is to ſaie, an offering vp of
himſelf for many. And he defineth the ſame 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : for
he ſaith thus,Mat. 20. 28. 
                     The ſonne of man came not to be miniſtred
vnto, but to miniſter,
                     Mark. 10. 45. 
                     and to giue his life 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
a redemption for many. Nowe, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      is not
redemption,Luke. 22. 27. as the olde intrepreter hath tranſlated it, but
the price of redemption. For, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in Gréeke
ſignifieth, whatſoeuer is paid downe for their redemption,
which are kept in captiuitie, which Homer in his
Iliads calleth 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is to ſay, the price of redemption.
                  The paſſion and death of Chriſt therefore is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
the price downe paid for the redemption of men, who
were held captiues and priſoners vnder the power of the
deuill: which price was paid to God, by whoſe iuſt iudgment
we were captiues. This price hath his infinit eſtimation,
& vncountable value, from the wonderfull vnion
or knitting of Gods nature and mans in one perſon.
Wherevpon Saint Paule doubteth not to ſpeake
thus:Acts. 20. 28. 
                     Eccleſiam, &c. The Church of God which he hath
purchaſed with his owne bloud.
                  
                  Héerevnto we will adde a fuller definition for declaration
ſake. The paſſion and death of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, God and man, is a propitiatorie ſacrifice, or ſacrifice
of attonement, wherein the eternall ſon of the eternall
God, béeing made man, offered himſelfe by the eternall
ſpirit vnto his father, that by this his oblation & obedience,
he might both purge the ſinnes of the world, and
appeaſe the wrath of God, to the ende that all ſuch as
beléeue, might be ſanctified vnto life euerlaſting through



him. As by this definition our vnderſtanding and iudgement
is rightly informed and taught concerning the paſſion
and death of Chriſt: ſo our faith muſt be ſtirred vp
and ſtedfaſtlie reſolued, that ſinne is ſo waſhed awaie by
the death of Chriſt, as that God doth remember it no
more. Moreouer wee muſt and ought, with continuall
thankfulnſſe, and innocencie of life, to aduaunce and extoll
this great benefit.
                  The ſecond point of this firſt member is, of the
Lordes reſurrection, wherof wée will ſhew brieflie what
is to be thought faithfullie and godlie. Firſt of all we
muſt holde faſt the teſtimonies of his reſurrection, which
are of thrée ſortes, as commonlie I make them: touching
theſe, the Catechiſme, and the hiſtorie of Chriſts reſurrection
ſet foorth in the Goſpell, muſt bée looked vpon
and conſidered. The definition of the Lordes reſurrection
muſt bée maintained: to wit, that the reſurrection
of Chriſt from the dead, is Chriſts victorie, and his triumph
ouer ſinne, death, hell, and ouer the whole kingdome
of Sathan. For Chriſt by his reſurrection, fulfilled
the promiſe:Gen. 3. 15. 
                     Semen mulieris, &c. The ſeede of the
woman ſhall bruſe the Serpents head: that is to ſaie,
(as Saint Iohn the Lords Apoſtle expoundeth it,)1. Ioh. 3. 8 
                     Chriſtus
apparuit, &c. Chriſt appeared that hee might deſtorie
the workes of the diuell. Chriſt therefore riſing
againe, is conquerour ouer Sathan, which Sathan lieth
conquered and cruſhed vnder the féete of Chriſt the
conquerour, that hée is no more able to drawe the faithfull,
that is to ſaie, the members of Chriſt, into death
and deſtruction, although he beare full ſwaie ouer the
reprobate and obſtinate: and vſeth manie and ſundrie
guilefull ſleights, to prouoke the faithfull to taſt the forbidden
fruite, and ſo to be caſt againe out of the
Lordes Paradiſe: that is to ſaie, hée goeth about with
corrupt doctrine, and lewde manners, to infect and poiſon
the faithfull, that the holie Ghoſt might be driuen



out of them, and ſo they, through the loſſe of faith, might
bée ſhut out of Gods houſholde, and ſo become caſtawaies.
In the third place the fruites of the Lords reſurrection
muſt bée gathered, which the godlie alone enioie:
the firſt wherof is,1. Cor. 15. 17. remiſſion of ſinnes. Si Chriſtus, &c.
If Chriſt bee not riſen, ye are yet in your ſinnes. Héerevnto
ſerueth that ſaieng of the Prophet Daniel:
                     Dan. 9. 24 
                     Auferetur,
&c. Wickedneſſe ſhall be finiſhed, ſinnes ſhall be
ſealed vp, and iniquitie reconciled. And although the
reconcilement of iniquitie, bée moſt properlie appertaining
to Chriſts paſſion and death, as before is declared:
yet notwithſtanding, it is alſo verie well applied to his
reſurrection, bicauſe this is the accompliſhment of all
Chriſts benefits. The ſecond is, our iuſtification: Reſurrexit,
                     Rom. 4. 25
                     &c. Chriſt is riſen againe for our iuſtification.
And Daniel ſaith,Dan. 9. 24 
                     Adducetur, &c. Euerlaſting righteouſneſſe
ſhall be brought in. Doth not Saint Paule
likewiſe define the obedience of Chriſt to bée our righteouſneſſe?
Both are true. For whatſoeuer is giuen to one
action or déede of Chriſt, the ſame is rightlie giuen to
them all, by reaſon of the ordinarie appointment and ordinance
common to all his works and actions. The third
is,Ioh. 16. 7 the giuing of the ſpirit. Niſi, &c. Except I goe my
waie, that comforter ſhall not come. And Paule ſaith, Emiſit,
                     Rom. 8. 15
                     &c. He hath ſent the ſpirit of his ſonne into your
hearts,
                     Gal. 4. 6. 
                     which crieth, Abba Pater, Abba Father. The
fourth is, the confirming of the couenant of grace, or an
aſſurance and certaine warrant of a good conſcience before
God. For ſo ſaith S. Peter, Habentes, &c. Hauing
a good conſcience.
                     1. Pet. 3. 16, &. 21 And, In that a good conſcience maketh
requeſt vnto God, The words at large lie in this
order, Cui reſpondens, &c. To the which alſo the figure
that now ſaueth vs (euen Baptiſme) agreeth: (not
the putting awaie of the filth of the fleſh, but in that
a good conſcience maketh requeſt vnto GOD) by the
reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt. The fift is, the renewing



of our ſelues, which is after two ſortes, to wit, of
our ſoules, and of our bodies. Of our ſoules, according
to that ſaieng of the Apoſtle,Rom. 6. 4. 
                     Reſurrexit, &c. Chriſt
was raiſed vp from the dead, by the glorie of his Father,
that wee alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of life.
Of our bodies, according to the wordes of the Apoſtle,
Chriſtus reſurrexit,
                     1. Cor. 15. 20. 21. 22 
                     &c. Chriſt is riſen from the dead,
and was made the firſt fruites of them that
ſlept. For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo
the reſurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die,
euen ſo in Chriſt all ſhall be made aliue. The ſixt is,
the bonde of mutuall fraternitie and brotherhoode.
For ſo the Lorde himſelfe riſing from the dead, ſpeaketh
to the women by, Aſcendo, &c. I go vp to my Father,
and to your Father: my God, and your God. If
therefore wée all haue but one Father in common
to vs all, if wée all are brothers and ſiſters in Chriſt:
it is méete, that like brothers and ſiſters wée bée all of
one minde, and tender one an other with brotherlie
affection and loue. The ſeuenth is, a generall remedie
againſt all calamities, againſt all woundes or ſores
of the ſoule, of the bodie, of our name and fame. Heerevnto
ſerueth the ſaieng of the Apoſtle to Timothie,
                     2. Tim. 2. 8.
                     Memento, &c. Remember that Ieſus Chriſt is riſen from
the dead: as if he ſhould haue ſaid, In this thy miniſterie
and office thou ſhalt féele manie diſtreſſes, thou ſhalt ſuffer
manie temptatious of the Diuell, and of men: but in
all theſe, take vnto thée for thy ſuccour & ſaftie, this notable
Treacle, namelie, the meditating of the Lordes
reſurrection: which as in the Lorde himſelfe it was the
victorie ouer all temptations and afflictions: ſo likewiſe
in vs it ſhall bée the ſame victorie, when we ſhall
be raiſed vp from the dead, by the power of Chriſts reſurrection.
The eight is, a perfect hope, or aſſured perſuaſion
of our glorious ſtate and immortalitie. Saint



                     Peter ſaith,1. Pet. 1. 3 
                     Regenuit nos, &c. Hee hath begotten vs againe
vnto a liuelie hope, by the reſurrection of Ieſus
Chriſt from the dead.
                  
                  The third point of this firſt member is, of the power
whereby the Lord was raiſed from the dead.Ioh. 10. 17. Chriſt ſaith,
Poteſtatem habeo, &c. I haue power to put away my life
from me, and to take it againe. Now, in this place, God
the Father is ſaid to haue raiſed him vp. In theſe words
there is no contrarietie of ſpeach. Chriſt in déed raiſed vp
himſelfe, as God, that is to ſaie, hée raiſed vp the nature
of his manhood, by the power of his Godhead: and
the Father raiſed him vp, as man. To bée ſhort becauſe
the eſſence or béeing of the Father, the Sonne, and
the holie Ghoſt is all one, and the ſelfe ſame, as touching
their diuinitie or Godhead, their works are vnſeparable.
Let theſe things ſuffice to be briefly ſpoken, concerning
the firſt member of this point: whereof in generall
there is a double vſe: to wit, that wée ſhould be confirmed
and eſtabliſhed in the knowledge of Chriſts death
and reſurrection: and that we ſhould proue and trie in our
ſelues a liuelie and quicke féeling of the ſame. In which
ſenſe S. Paule ſpeaketh to the Romanes,
                     Rom. 6. 4. 6, &c. where he aſcribeth
mortification & viuification (or for the better vnderſtanding
of the words, the making of vs dead, & the making
of vs aliue) that is to ſaie, newneſſe of life, vnto the
Lords death and reſurrection.
                  The ſecond member now followeth, wherof the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh, ſaieng: (And hath ſet him at his right hand
in the heauenlie places.) This member conteineth two
Articles of our beliefe: the firſt is, The Lords aſcending
into Heauen: the ſecond is, his ſitting at the right hand
of God. For his aſcending thether went before his ſitting
there. Nowe, this aſcending of the Lord was
done viſible. For hée was carried vp into heauen in
a bodilie and naturall manner from the ſight of his
Diſciples. For ſo it is ſaide in the Actes, Cernentibus



ipſis,
                     Acts. 1. 9. 
                     &c. While they beheld, hee was taken vp:
for a clowde tooke him vp out of their ſight. And
from thence was he caried aboue al heauens, & placed in
heauenlie places, at the right hand of God his Father:
as Saint Paule ſheweth in this place, and in the fourth
Chapter following. The Article therefore of the Lords
aſcending, ought to be vnderſtood of Chriſts true and verie
bodie, and of the naturall placing thereof in heauen,
leaſt we ſhould thinke, that Chriſts manhood was ſwallowed
vp of his Godhead, as Stenkfield dreamed: or that
it was extended & ſpread throughout all places with his
Godhead, as the heretike Eutyches doted. For both their
opinions doth take away the truth of his humanitie or
manhood. The ſaieng therefore of Saint Cyprian is to
be allowed, in theſe words: Aſcendit in coelis, &c. He
aſcended into heauen, not where God the word was not
before: but where the word being made fleſh ſate not
before, to wit, in a bodilie place. The ſitting at the
right hand of God his Father, belongeth to the power of
ruling, wherein the ſonne being equall with his Father,
doth as it were part ſtakes, and poſſeſſeth equall rule and
regiment with him. For the right hand of the Father, betokeneth
a diuine power, maieſtie, and dominion. Wherfore,
to ſit at the right hand of the Father, is to be equall
with the Father in diuine power, maieſtie, and dominion.
And becauſe the Apoſtle maketh mention of (The
right hand of the Father in heauenlie places,) he therefore
giueth vs to note by the right hand of the Father,
the place of bleſſedneſſe, happineſſe, and euerlaſting
reſt and quietneſſe, promiſed to all faithfull beléeuers,
which place the bodie of Chriſt alreadie poſſeſſeth.
                  But this is not againſt the ſaieng of Chriſt,Matth. 28. 20. 
                     Ero vobiſcum,
&c. I wil be with you euerie where, euen to the end
of the world: neither doth it take away the truth of the
Lords bodie and bloud in the holie Supper. For Chriſt



is all whole, whereſoeuer it is his will to be. More of
this matter, and that verie learned and godlie, is to be
read in the Commentaries of Philip Melancthon vpon
the firſt Chapter to the Coloſsians.
                  
                  Furthermore the fruite of either article: namelie, of
the Lords aſcending, and of his ſitting at the right hand
of the Father, is declared at large in the fourth Chapter
folowing,Pſa. 68. 18 where ye Apoſtle expoundeth this ſaieng of the
Pſalmiſt, Aſcendit in altum, &c. He aſcended vp on
high, he lead captiuitie captiue, & gaue gifts vnto men.
                  
                  The third member is an expoſition of the ſecond.
(Farre aboue all principalitie, & power, and might, and
domination, and euerie name that is named, not in this
world onelie, but alſo in that which is to come.) For in
theſe words the Apoſtle ſheweth verie notablie, what
Chriſt, ſitting at the right hand of his Father in heauenlie
places, is. For, by theſe words, the Apoſtle meaneth nothing
elſe, than to ſignifie Chriſts rule, which is noted to
be excéeding great, as the Article of his ſitting at his
Fathers right hand importeth: and that he hath no rule,
either in this world, or in the world to come, aboue that.
Now, whereas Dionyſius out of theſe words of the Apoſtle,
maketh I wot not what orders of Angels, it is
but weake. Neither is it to anie purpoſe to knowe, what
orders of Angels, and what degrées of dignities are in
Heauen: ſéeing that the word of God ſheweth no ſuch
thing vnto vs. Onelie let this be inough for vs to vnderſtand,
That Angels are miniſters: & (as in the Epiſtle
to the Hebrewes is declared, miniſtering ſpirits miniſters
of the Churches,Heb. 1. 14. of Commonwealths, & of houſholds in
the world. Now, touching the words of Saint Paule, this
is worth the knowing, that he maketh difference verie
trimlie of degrées in dignities by theſe foure words,
(Principalitie, Power, Might, and Domination.)
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Principalitie, ſignifieth an order of the higher
to the lower, from whom obedience muſt procéede to the



higher, as to the better. When therefore the Apoſtle
ſaith, (That Chriſt ſitteth farre aboue all Principalitie,)
he meaneth, that Chriſt is Lord and King 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
that is, at no mans call or commaund, to giue a reckoning
of his rule. For he hath no Prince aboue him, to
whom he is compelled as a ſubiect to be obedient, & to
ſerue. For, as he is of one & the ſelfe ſame nature with
his Father touching his Godhead: ſo hath he equall
rule with his Father. Héerehence let euerie faithfull
ſoule comfort himſelfe againſt the enimies of Chriſt, and
againſt all principalities of the world and of Hell: yea,
let him make full accompt, that it ſhall one day come to
paſſe, that whatſoeuer is alofte, ſhall be brought downe,
and made ſubiect, (will they, nill they,) to the rule of
Chriſt. Let no Chriſtian therefore, if he loue godlineſſe,
become obedient, either to men or Diuels, if they commaund
anie thing that is againſt the lawes of Ieſus
Chriſt our Prince.
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Power, betokeneth the right of ruling: which
right is due to Chriſt, for two reaſons, Firſt, in reſpect
of his nature, as he is God, whereby he is one & the ſame
God with the Father and the Holie Ghoſt, to whom all
things are of right in ſubiection. Secondlie, in conſideration
of the victorie, whereby he ouercame the Diuell
our open aduerſarie: ſo that Chriſt is aboue all, by the
right of ruling both waies.
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Might, noteth the ableneſſe of his rule,
ſo that no force or puiſſance can empaire his rule, or leſſen
it. Héereby faith hath wherewith to encourage it ſelfe, in
temptations, and at the point of death, againſt all the
aſſaults of the Diuell. For if the might of Chriſt doeth
ouermaſter all other manner of mights, then there is
no cauſe why the faithfull ſhould feare the gates of
hell.
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Domination, hath relation to all creatures,



good and badde, whom Chriſt is able to make couch and
lie at his feete, by the vertue of his power: and can conſtraine
them, (will they, nill they,) to confeſſe Chriſt their
King and Conquerour. Héerevpon it is written to the
Romanes,
                     Rom. 14. 11. and to the Philippians, Quòd omne genu, &c.
That at the name of Ieſus, euerie knee ſhould bow, both
of things in Heauen,
                     Phil. 2. 10. 
                     and things in earth, and things vnder
the earth, acknowledging his rule and power. Héervnto
Saint Paule addeth the generalitie, ſaieng: (And
aboue euerie name that is named) that is to ſay, aboue
euerie thing, which excelleth anie manner of way, whatſoeuer.
The diuiſion which followeth, (Not in this
world onelie, but alſo in that which is to come,) is referred
to the foure former members. For it importeth
thus much, That Chriſt is far aboue all things, not onelie
in this tranſitorie world now preſent, but in the
euerlaſting world which is to come. The prerogatiue
therefore or ſouereigntie of Chriſt, aboue all principalitie,
power, might, and domination, is not temporall, but
eternall: for it ſtretcheth out euen to the world to come.
There is no cauſe therfore why the faithfull ſhould feare,
leaſt Chriſt being at anie time diſgarded, and put beſide
his rule, they ſhould ſuffer the iniuries, and féele the tyrannies
of their enimies: or ſhould bée preſſed downe,
and wrongfullie kept vnder, with the rule of ſome new
Lord ſuccéeding.
                  The fift member conteineth the largeneſſe of his rule
and kingdome. The Apoſtle ſaith, (And hath made all
things ſubiect vnder his feete.) For as before, he was
made the ſeruaunt of all, that he might ſaue man, who
was loſt and caſt away: ſo now, being made Conquerour,
he hath all things at his commaundement and ſeruice:
inſomuch that all things are forced to fall at his
féete, and to ſtand in awe of his gouernment. Neither is
this ſubiection proper to his friends and houſhold onelie:
but perteineth alſo to his enimies, to all diuells, & wicked



men, inſomuch that the verie Diuels themſelues obeie
Chriſt with quaking and trembling. Héerehence hath
faith wherewith to ſtrengthen it ſelfe againſt all the
gates of Hell. For faith muſt be 
                        •••
                     ſuaded, and builded
vpon this ſure ground, that 
                        〈◊〉
                      much ſtronger, than
that anie can or dare ſpoile him, and take anie thing from
him againſt his will.
                  The ſixt member conteineth a certeine ſingular forme
or manner of Chriſts rule and regiment, whereby he gouerneth
the Church of God. For the Apoſtle ſaith) (And
hath appointed him ouer all things, to be the head to
the Church.) Now whereas Chriſt is héere ſaid (To be
appointed of the Father the head to the Church,) this
doth neuer a whit leſſen or diminiſh the maieſtie of
Chriſt, whereby (according to his nature, as he is God,)
he hath rule ouer all things with his Father. For Chriſt
(as Gregorie of Nice ſaith) is ſaid to take or receiue that
as man, which he hath naturallie as God.
                  By this tearme Head, is ſignified, both that ſupremaſie
or ſouereigne rule of Chriſt, which he alone hath
ouer the Church: and alſo the glorie of the Church. For,
if Chriſt be the head, and the Church the bodie, then
(no doubt) great is the glorie of the Church. For,
where the head is, there is likewiſe the bodie. For there
is no middle place, whereby the head ſhould be ſeparated
from the bodie. Whoſoeuer therefore (beſides Ieſus
Chriſt alone) taketh vnto himſelfe this honour, and will
be counted, called, and knowne the head of the Church,
he is a right Antichriſt, and one which traiterouſlie ſéeketh
to robbe Chriſt of his honour. As for that which the
Popes mainteiners bring, who imagine that the Church
hath two heads: the one gouerning, as principall: the
other obeieng as vaſſall: it is nothing. For the miniſters
of the Church of God, though ſome haue this degrée
of dignitie, or place of preeminence: other ſome
that, for the better ordering of the Church: yet notwithſtanding,



all are miniſters, neither is one the others head,
but fellowe ſeruants in the Lord. So Saint Paule calleth
them which were miniſters vnder him, Fellowe ſeruants,
                     Col. 1. 7. & 4. 7. 9.
                     fellowe ſouldiors, fellowe workers of God, & bretheren.
Furthermore, Chriſt is called (The head of the
Church,)Phil. 2. 25. foure waies. Firſt, in power and force. For
as the powers of man,3. Ioh. 1. 2. comming from the head, are conueied
throughout the whole bodie, by the veines and ſinewes:
ſo the faithfull, what force ſoeuer they haue,
they receiue it from Chriſt. For, in that the faithfull are
mortified in the fleſh, and quickened in the ſpirit, they
haue that by the power of Chriſts death and reſurrection,
who is their head. For the power and vertue of Chriſts
death kéepeth the fleſh vnder in the beléeuers: and by the
efficacie and force of Chriſts life, a new ſpirit is begotten
in man: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that he walketh
in newneſſe of life. Secondlie, Chriſt is called (The
head of the Church) in perfection. For he alone deſerueth
the praiſe of perfection in the Church. For all vertues in
him are moſt perfect, from whom certeine beames (as it
were from the Sunne) doe ſhine & ſhoote vpon the faithfull.
Thirdlie, Chriſt is called (The head of the Church)
in merit. For he alone in the Church hath merits, wherewith
he merited and deſerued for vs the heauenlie inheritaunce.
Fourthlie, Chriſt is called (The head of the
Church) in dignitie, order and authoritie. For he alone is
the Monarch of the Church, and a Prince at no mans
controllment.
                  But leaſt anie ſhould thinke, that S. Paule ſpeaketh,
of Chriſt onelie, as of the Prince of the Church, he addeth
a ſeuenth member, and ſaith: (Of the Church, which
is his bodie.) Chriſt therfore is the head, & the Church his
bodie, to whom all efficacie force, & power floweth from
the head Heere we haue to marke a verie trimme definition
of the Church, whereby it is defined to be (The bodie
of Chriſt,) not naturall, but myſticall. Of this bodie



there are two ſorts of members: to wit, dead and liuing.
They are dead members, who with the outward aſſemblie
of the Church, & viſible congregation make confeſſion
of their faith, but yet are void of ye ſpirit of faith: ſuch
are Heretikes, Hypocrites, & carnall Goſpellers. The liuing
or liuelie members are they, which being indued wt
a liuelie faith walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit,
whereby they are lead to be briefe, whoſoeuer do ſincerelie
liue in Chriſtianitie, they are the liuelie members
of Chriſt As for the Turkes, vnbeléeuing Iewes, & other
Heatheniſh hearted people, they all are to be reputed &
thought neither liuelie nor dead members of the Church.
                  Moreouer, when the Apoſtle ſaith, (Euen the fulnes of
him, that filleth all in all things,) he ſheweth why he calleth
the Church (The bodie of Chriſt:) and therewithall
declareth, how great the loue of Chriſt is towards his
Church: which he calleth (The fulneſſe of himſelfe.) For,
ſuch is ye loue of Chriſt towards his Church, that althogh
he perfourme all healthfull things in all men: yet notwithſtanding,
he thinketh himſelfe a head halt & lame, vnleſſe
he haue ye Church as his bodie knit vnto him. Héerevpon
it followeth, that Chriſt is oftentimes taken for the
whole Church together, ioined vnto hir head, as when it
is ſaid:1. Cor. 12. 12. &. 13. 
                     Sicut enim vnum corpus, &c. For as the bodie is
one, & hath many members, & all the members of the bodie,
which is one, though they be manie, yet are but one
body: euen ſo Chriſt. For by one ſpirit are we all baptiſed
into one bodie: that is, that we might be made one bodie
with Chriſt, that we might grow into one body of Chriſt,
that ye whole church might be nothing els but one Chriſt:
of which growing together, Baptiſme & the Lords ſupper
are effectuall ſignes. Héerevnto ſerueth the ſaieng of the
Apoſtle, Abrahae dictae ſunt, &c. To Abraham and his
ſeede were the promiſes made.
                     Gal. 3. 16. 
                     He ſaith not, And to the
ſeedes, as ſpeaking of manie: but, And to thy ſeede, as of
one, which is Chriſt. Héere the Apoſtle calleth Chriſt.



(The whole bodie gathered together in one,) whoſe
head and life Chriſt alone is: the members of whom are
the faithfull, being partlie Iewes, and partlie Gentiles.
This he concludeth in the ende of the Chapter more
plainlie in theſe words,Gal. 3. 28. 
                     Omnes vos, &c. Ye are all one
in Chriſt Ieſus. Héerehence had theſe manner of ſpeaches
their vſe and cuſtome, To be made one with Chriſt,
To be with Chriſt, Chriſt to be in vs, To be lead by
the ſpirit of Chriſt, To be choſen in Chriſt, To be called
& iuſtified in Chriſt, To liue in Chriſt, To die with
Chriſt, To be crucified, buried, and riſe againe with
Chriſt. Héereto alſo ſerueth that which followeth in
the third Chapter following,Epheſ. 3. 6. 
                     That the Goſpell was preached
and reuealed to the Gentiles, that they ſhould be
inheritours alſo, and of the ſame bodie, and partakers of
the promiſe in Chriſt. Héerevnto alſo perteineth the
words of Saint Paule to the Galathians,
                     Gal. 2. 20. where he ſaith,
That he liueth in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him. And to this
alſo belongeth that ſpeach of Chriſt:Actes. 9. 4. 
                     Saule, Saule, why
perſecuteſt thou me?
                  
                  Now, what haue the faithfull to gather héereby? Euen
to build their hope and comfort vpon this, that Chriſt
cannot periſh, of whom they are members by faith. Héerby
alſo haue the faithfull to ſuccour & ſtrengthen themſelues,
in life, in death, and euerie daunger: bicauſe
they are aſſured that the time will come, when Chriſt
ſhalbe glorified with his whole bodie: howſoeuer his
members amidſt the hurlie burlies of this world be contemned,
and ſpitefullie ouertroden. But to the end we
may knowe, that Chriſt of himſelfe néedeth not this fulneſſe,
the Apoſtle addeth, (That filleth all, in all things.)
For indéed, if Chriſt filleth and perfourmeth all in all
things, then doubtles he ſtandeth not in need of anie mans
helpe hérein towards this fulneſſe: but ſo far forth as it
pleaſeth him, of his vnmeaſurable & bottomles bountie,
to vouchſafe ye Church to be ioined vnto him, as if it were



his bodie. This place likewiſe containeth a plentifull
teſtimonie touching Chriſts Godhead. For ſéeing it doth
properlie belong to the nature of God, (To fill all in all
things:) & ſeing this abilitie is héere aſcribed vnto Chriſt,
That he filleth all in all things:) it followeth, that
Chriſt is true God, and in perſon infinite and eternall.
                  It is therefore well ſaid in the Church: Chriſt is all
in all euerie where, Chriſt filleth all in all, The ſonne of
the virgin is God. For theſe titles are right wel applied to
his perſon, in reſpect of the nature of his Godhead, not in
reſpect of the nature of his manhood, which hath his peculiar
properties, the taking awaie wherof, is the taking
awaie of the truth of Chriſts manhood, & the ouerthrowing
of the hope of our reſurrection. Wherefore that ſaieng
of S. Paule to the Philippians is throughly to be ſetled
in memorie,Phil. 3. 21. 
                     Noſtra corpora, &c. That our vile bodies
ſhall be changed, and faſhioned like vnto Chriſts glorious
bodie.
                  
                  Now, if Chriſts manhood were turned into his Godhead
(as in times paſt the Eutychians wickedlie maintained,
and at this daie Stenkfield traiterouſlie teacheth,)
there ſhould remaine for vs no hope at all of our reſurrection.
Let this ſuffice to be ſpoken of this part or
parcell, wherein Saint Paule ſetteth foorth the principall
points of our faith concerning Chriſt, and verie brieflie
commendeth vnto vs the fruite of them therewithall.
               
            
            
               ¶OF PREDESTINATION.
               NOw, forſomuch as there is often mention made of
Predeſtination & Election to euerlaſting life, in this
Chapter, it ſéemeth a neceſſarie labour vnto me, to adde
héervnto certaine aſſertions or auouchments, which ſhall
containe in them the ſum of the doctrine touching Predeſtination:
which I haue done, to this purpoſe, that this



doctrine, which is the ground worke of our ſaluation,
may be the more manifeſt, and the thinking therevpon
ſwéete and comfortable to the godlie Reader, when the
circumſtances of the ſame are dulie conſidered.
               
                  I.
                  It is verie néedfull, that the Church be inſtructed and
taught throughlie, concerning the eternall Predeſtination
and Election of men to the bliſfull & euerlaſting life. For
as no doctrine can miniſter comfort more abundantlie,
to true Chriſtian conſciences, than the doctrine of Predeſtination
rightlie declared: ſo, nothing is more daungerous,
than to ſwarue and ſtraie from the true meane
and manner of Predeſtination.
               
               
                  II.
                  Wherefore, to the end we may not ſwarue and ſtraie
from the meane and manner of Predeſtination & Election,
which the Scripture commendeth vnto vs, there muſt
good héede be taken. For whoſoeuer ouerſhooteth & miſſeth
the marke thereof, hée is carried into a perillous
breaknecke, whereout he cannot recouer himſelfe, except
he haue ſuccour from heauen.
               
               
                  III.
                  Some there are, which when they heare, that our ſaluation
ſtandeth vpon the purpoſe & Election of God, neglecting
the true meane and manner thereof, imagine to
themſelues certaine dreames of the Sto
                           •
                        kes, & tables of
deſtinie: wherewith they both intangle themſelues miſerablie,
and leade others out of the waie daungerouſlie.
               
               
                  IIII.
                  For it cannot otherwiſe be, but that hée which imagineth
bookes of deſtinie & lucke, whereby to learne & know
who ſhall be ſaued, & who damned, either ſwelleth with
vaine hypocriſie, or pineth away with dedlie deſperation.
               
               
                  
                  V.
                  For ſome, laieng faſt holde vpon a certaine kinde of
fleſhlie careleſneſſe, run headlong with full libertie into
all kinde of miſchiefe and villanie: to themſelues vndoubted
deſtruction, to others a grieuous offenſe.
               
               
                  VI.
                  Otherſome are carried into a contrarie euill: who,
whiles they dreame of a particular promiſe of grace, againſt
the word of God, they are plunged ouer head and
eares, into the bottomleſſe pit of deſpaire: wherein they
muſt néeds be caſt alwaie for euer, vnleſſe the right hand
of God, raiſing them vp in time, they earneſtlie repent.
               
               
                  VII.
                  Wherefore, ſéeing that we heare the myſterie of Predeſtination
commended vnto vs in the word of God: it behoueth
vs to ſéeke the meane, the manner, & true cauſe
therof in ye Oracle or word of God likewiſe: which if we
haue once rightlie learned, it ſhall fill vs with ercéeding
great comfort, & ſhall be vnto vs not onlie a ſpur to prick
vs forward to all exerciſes of godlineſſe, but alſo an aſſured
anchor, wherevppon to ſtaie, euen at the pointe of
death.
               
               
                  VIII.
                  
                     Now, the meane and manner of Predeſtination is moſt
true,
                     Ephe. 1. 4. 
                     which S. Paule ſheweth vnto, vs, when he writeth
thus to the Epheſians, (Elegit, &c. He hath choſen vs in
Chriſt, before the foundation of the world, that wee
ſhould be holie,Ephe. 1. 5. & without blame before him in loue.)
Againe, (Praedeſtinauit nos, &c. He hath predeſtinated
vs, to be adopted, through Ieſus Chriſt, vnto himſelfe.)
Againe,
                     Ephe. 1. 6. 7. (Gratos nos, &c. He hath made vs accepted in
his beloued, by whom we haue redemption throgh his
bloud.Ephe. 1. 9. 10. (Againe, Propoſuit, &c. Hee hath purpoſed
to gather together in one,Ephe. 1. 11. 12. all things in Chriſt.) Againe,
(In quo, &c. In whom alſo wee are choſen, when wee
were predeſtinate, according to the purpoſe of him,



which worketh all things, after the counſell of his owne
will, that we which firſt truſted in Chriſt, ſhould be vnto
the praiſe of his glorie:)Ephe. 1. 13 14. 
                     Againe, (In quo, &c. In
whom alſo ye haue truſted, after that ye heard the word
of truth, euen the Goſpell of your ſaluation, wherein
alſo, after that ye beleeued, ye were ſealed with the
holie ſpirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritaunce.)
               
               
                  IX.
                  Heere Saint Paule moſt plainlie declareth the meane
and manner of our Predeſtination, whiles he ſaith, that
God hath predeſtinate vs to ſaluation by and in Chriſt.
By Chriſt, as our mediatour and redéemer. In Chriſt, as
in and with our head: whoſe members we are made by
faith, which the Goſpell preacheth vnto all people and
perſons indifferentlie.
               
               
                  X.
                  God therefore hath predeſtinate vs, not by regiſtring
our names in bookes of deſtinie and fortune, as
Zeno and his ſchollers doted: but by appointing and ordeining
an aſſured meane and manner of ſaluation by
and in Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of his will.
               
               
                  XI.
                  In this meane and manner the condition of faith is
contained. For, when we are graffed into Chriſt by faith,
we are made members of his bodie: and therefore are
wée called (Elect and choſen) bicauſe we are the members
of Chriſt.
               
               
                  XII.
                  
                     Now, how neceſſarie this condition is, by Gods good
appointment, the teſtimonies are many which declare it.
S. Paule reaſoning of Predeſtination,
                     Rom. 9. 30 31. 32. 
                     beateth much vpon
this condition, ſaieng: Quid igitur dicemus? &c. What
ſhall wee ſaie then? That the Gentiles which followed



not righteouſneſſe, haue attained vnto righteouſneſſe,
euen the righteouſneſſe which is of faith? But Iſrael.
which followed the lawe of righteouſneſſe, could not
attaine vnto the lawe of righteouſneſſe. Wherefore? Becauſe
they ſought it not by faith, but as it were, by the
workes of the lawe.Rom. 10. 2 &c. 
                     This condition likewiſe the Apoſtle
rehearſeth in the tenth Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle,
and laboureth verie much thereabout alſo elſewhere:
                     Coloſs. 1. 23.

in the faith:1. Tim. 2. 15. 
                     Alſo, Participes, &c. Whoſe houſe we are, if
we holde faſt the confidence, and the receiuing of the
hope vnto the end: Againe, Mulier, &c. The woman

&c. I chaſtiſe my bodie, and bring it downe in
ſubiection, leaſt while I preach to other, I my ſelfe proue
a caſtawaie. If therefore S. Paule, the choſen veſſell of
God, duetifullie diſcharged his obedience towards God
by faith, then (no doubt) through the want of faith he had
fallen from grace, and through his owne default, become
a caſtawaie. To the ſame end driue the words of the
Prophet leremie, in the perſon of the Lord, ſaieng: Si poenitentiam
egerit,Iere. 18. 8. 10. &c. But if this nation, againſt whom I
haue pronounced, turne from their wickedneſſe, I will
repent of the plague that I thought to bring vpon them.
But if it doe euill in my ſight, and heare not my voice, I
will repent of the good that I thought to do for them.
               
               
                  XIIII.
                  Héereby plainlie appeareth, that Gods predeſtination
is ratified & confirmed by & in Chriſt: and that therefore
it requireth at our hands the condition of faith, whereby



wée are graffed into Chriſt, and ſo numbered among the
choſen.
               
               
                  XV.
                  Vpon the things which we haue hetherto ſpoken,What Predeſtination is. let
vs make this definition of Predeſtination: Predeſtination
is the ordinance of God, whereby he hath appointed
by and in Chriſt, before the foundation of the world was
laide, according to his good pleaſure, and the counſell or
purpoſe of his will, all ſuch to life euerlaſting, as ſhould
beleeue in Chriſt their redeemer, that they might be holie
and blameleſſe before him, & that they might magnifie
the praiſe of the glorie of his grace, for euer & euer
world without end. The oppoſite or contrarie to Predeſtination,
is Reprobation, whereby ſo manie as care not
for beléeuing in Chriſt, & ſo manie as continue not in the
faith of Chriſt to their liues end, are cut off from grace,
baniſhed from euerlaſting life, and like bondſlaues condemned
to perpetuall paines. The cauſe of this reprobation
is the ſin of men, & the iuſtice of God puniſhing offenders,
which foreſlowe to flée for ſuccour to the mercie
ſeate, which God hath vouchſafed to ſet before men, in
open ſight.
               
               
                  XVI.
                  Furthermore, when we require the condition of
faith, we do therewithall reproue Phariſaicall errour,
touching the worthineſſe of perſons, the prerogatiue of
fleſh, the merits of mens works, &c. Wherevpon this alſo
followeth, That we muſt not iudge of this great myſterie,
either after reaſon, or according to the law. For, as
reaſon ſéemeth to make the worthineſſe of perſons, & the
prerogatiue of fleſh, the cauſe of election: ſo the law likewiſe
ſéemeth vnto Hypocrites, (but yet amiſſe) to make
the merits of works the cauſe of election.
               
               
                  XVII.
                  The cauſe therefore of our predeſtination is not in vs,
as the Monks thought, who were farre wide, but in God:



which cauſe the Apoſtle calleth (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,Ephe. 1. 5. 
                     voluntas
Dei, The good pleaſure of Gods will,) And S. Auguſtine,
Miſericordiſsimam Dei voluntatem, The moſt
mercifull will of God. Of this will of God toward men,
when we are well warranted, & certeinlie aſſured, then
haue we an vnmouable foundation of our predeſtination.
For (God worketh all things,
                     Ephe. 1. 11 
                     after the counſell of his
owne will,) as Saint Paule witneſſeth.
               
               
                  XVIII.
                  The moſt mercifull will of God, is not vnknowne, or
hidden from vs: but deliuered & opened by the voice or
ſound of the Goſpell: & in foure things chieflie it is to be
ſeene: namelie, In the ſending of his ſon, In the promiſe,
In the commandement, and In the ſealing of grace.
               
               
                  XIX.
                  This ſending of the ſonne, is a ſubſtantiall teſtimonie
of Gods fatherlie will towards vs, according to this ſaieng
of the ſon:Iohn. 3. 16 
                     Sic Deus, &c. So God loued the world,
that he gaue his onelie begotten ſonne,
                     1. Ioh. 4. 9 
                     that as manie as
beleeue in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting
life.
                     Rom. 5. 8. And againe, Commendat Deus, &c. God ſetteth out
his loue towards vs, ſeeing that whiles we were yet ſinners,
Chriſt died for vs. The price therfore which he paid
downe, is a ſufficient amends for the miſdéedes of the
world. For the Father himſelfe confeſſeth, That in his
ſonne he is well pleaſed,Mat. 17. 5 and biddeth vs boldlie heare
him.
               
               
                  XX.
                  No man hath to thinke, that the ſonne was ſent into
the world, to redéeme a certaine number, put a part
from the reſt of mankind onlie: but rather, to take awaie
the ſins of the whole world, according to that ſaieng: Ecce
agnus,
                     Iohn. 1. 29 36. 
                     &c. Behold the lambe of God, which taketh away
the ſins of the world. For, as he toke vpon him ye nature



common to vs all, ſo with our nature, he tooke likewiſe
our cauſe. For ſo he ſaith openlie of himſelfe, Filius
hominis,
                     Math. 18. 11. 
                     &c. The ſonne of man came to ſaue that which
was loſt. Now, there were not a few handfuls of mankind
loſt, but all mankinde, one with an other. As therefore
in Adam we all fell:
                     1. Cor. 15. 22. 
                     ſo the promiſe of the ſeede which
ſhould bruſe the ſerpents head, is giuen to all Adams ofſpring.
                     1. Ioh. 3. 8.
Héerevpon ſaith S. Iohn, Chriſtus apparuit, &c.
Chriſt appeared, to deſtroie the works of the Deuill.
Wherfore (as S. Paule ſaith,1. Tim. 1. 15.) Fidelis hic ſermo, &c. This
is a true ſaieng, & by all meanes, worthie to be receiued,
that Chriſt Ieſus came into the world to ſaue ſinners.
                  
               
               
                  XXI.
                  Now, in that the ſucceſſe (the more pitie) is not anſwerable
to the fathers will, who ſent his ſonne: nor to the
deſire of the ſonne, who ſuffered puniſhment for mans
ſinne: that proceedeth from their own malice & wilfulnes:
for that they béeing bidden of a moſt mercifull & gentle
father, to the mariage of his beſt beloued ſonne, & might
be welcome gueſts, cared not for comming, but vnthankfullie
ſet at naught his kindnes: as Chriſt himſelfe complaineth,Math. 20. 16, &. 22. 14.
ſaieng: Multi ſunt vocati, &c. Manie are called,
but few are choſen: that is to ſaie, Few beléeue & bring
foorth fruits worthie of repentaunce. This is the cauſe
why they are ſhut out of the Bridehouſe, as gueſts not
garniſhed with a wedding garment.
               
               
                  XXII.
                  THE PROMISE OF GRACE, which
in déede ſtretcheth vnto all, doth likewiſe commend vnto
vs the moſt mercifull will of our heauenlie father. Heervnto
ſerue manie ſaiengs, & among the reſt theſe which
followe. Haec eſt voluntas, &c. This is the will of my
Father,Iohn. 6. 40 which ſent mee, that (all) which ſee the ſonne, &
beleeue in him,Mat. 18. 14. ſhould haue life euerlaſting. Againe, Sic
non eſt, &c. So is it not the will of your Father which



is in heauen, that (one) of theſe little ones ſhould periſh.
Againe,
                     1. Tim. 2. 4 Deus vult, &c. It is the will of God, that (all)
ſhould be ſaued,2. Pet. 3. 9. and come vnto the knowledge of the
truth.Ezek. 18. 23. 32. 
                     Againe, Deus longanimis, &c. God is patient and
long ſuffering towards vs, and would haue (no man) to
periſh, but would (all men) to come to repentaunce. To
this alſo perteineth that place of the Prophet, Nolo
mortem, &c. I will not the death of a ſinner: but that
he repent and liue. Héerevpon ſaith Saint Barnard, Prodit
in lucem, &c. The great counſell, which from the euerlaſting,
laie hid in the boſome of euerlaſtingneſſe, is
come abroad in light, for the comfort of the miſerable
and diſtreſſed: bicauſe God will not the death of a ſinner,
but rather that he ſhould repent and liue.
               
               
                  XXIII.
                  This promiſe of grace, as it reacheth vnto all, ſo is it
alſo fréelie giuen, and is to be receiued by faith alone.
The Apoſtle moſt plainlie auoucheth both, in the 9. 10.
& 11. Chapters of his Epiſtle to the Romanes: where
he aloweth no place at all to the prerogatiue of the fleſh,Eſai. 28. 16
nor to the merits of workes,Ioel. 2. 32. & concludeth, that (Whoſoeuer
beleeueth,
                     Actes. 2. 21 
                     ſhall not be put to ſhame. For (ſaith he)
there is no difference of the Iew and the Gentile.
                     Rom. 10. 11. 12. 
                     For
the ſame Lord of all,
                     Rom. 9. 33 
                     is rich vnto all that call vpon him.
                  
               
               
                  XXIIII.
                  Héereto ſerue thoſe notable figures, which the ſame
Apoſtle ſetteth foorth, when he bringeth in Iſmael and
Iſaach, the two ſonnes of Abraham: and Iacob and Eſau,
the two ſonnes of Iſaach. Which figures are thus to be
applied. In aſſured bleſſings and benefits belonging to
this life, not all which are borne of Abrahams & Iſaachs
ſéede, are counted their children: much leſſe in ſpirituall
things ſhall they be taken for their children, which come
of the loines of theſe holie Fathers. Wherefore, as in



the bleſſings or benefits belonging to this life, they onelie
are reputed the children of the holie Patriarches, concerning
whom they had promiſes: (as Abraham of Iſaach,
and not of Iſmael: Iſaach of Iacob, and not of Eſau:)
euen ſo in ſpirituall things, they onelie are to be accounted
Abrahams children, which beléeue in the frée promiſe,
and not they which ſwell and are proud of the prerogatiue
of the fleſh.
               
               
                  XXV.
                  As for the Apoſtles concluſion, it hath none other meaning:Rom. 9. 16
                     Non eſt igitur, &c, It is not therefore in him which
willeth, nor in him which runneth, but in God which
hath mercie. Of which concluſion, this is the true and
perfect meaning without doubt. It is not in him which
willeth, nor in him which runneth, to wit, according to
the fleſh: becauſe the will of the fleſh, and the running of
the fleſh, ſtaie vpon the prerogatiue of the fleſh, and the
merits of workes: and therefore they are flat againſt the
mercie of God, and the merite of Chriſt. But it is in him
that willeth, and in him that runneth, according to the
promiſe, that is to ſay, of him which beleueth: bicauſe, All
things are poſsible to him that beleeueth.
                     Mark. 9. 23 For this will,
and this running commend the mercie of God, & reſt onelie
vpon the mercie promiſed in Chriſt. What followeth
héerevpon? Euen that which the Apoſtle hath ſet downe:
namelie, That the children of the promiſe, and not the
children of the fleſh are heires.
                  
               
               
                  XXVI.
                  
                     Now, who are the children of the promiſe? Forſooth,
as manie as beléeue in the promiſe, as Abraham did beléeue.
For the Apoſtle nameth them the children of the
promiſe,
                     Rom. 4. 12 Qui inſiſtunt; &c. Which walke in the ſteps of
Abrahams faith. And he ſaith yet againe, Scitote, &c.
Knowe you therefore, that they which are of faith, the
ſame are the children of Abraham.Gal. 3. 7. If they be children,
then are they alſo heires, according to the promiſe.
               
               
                  
                  XXVII.
                  They which denie this grace of God reaching vnto
all, (ſo much as belongeth to the fatherlie will of God,)
beſides that they ſet themſelues againſt Saint Paule, and
heaue and ſhoue to ſhake in ſunder the conſent of the
whole ſcripture, they offend moſt grieuouſlie otherwiſe.
For, firſt of all, they make God a reſpecter of perſons: &
againe, they imagine in God two contrarie willes.
               
               
                  XXVIII.
                  But that God is no reſpecter of perſons, there are
manie places of ſcripture which giue manifeſt proofe. For
God doth alwaies allow the good cauſe, & euermore condemneth
the euill cauſe: according to this rule, Fideles,
&c.
                     Pſa. 31. 23 
                     The Lord keepeth the faithfull, as for the proud, he
will paie them their hire. Nothing therfore is more certeine,
than that God receiueth the repentaunt to grace
and fauour: contrariwiſe, that he giueth ouer the vnrepentaunt,
ſetting apart all reſpect of perſons.
               
               
                  XXIX.
                  Now,Tvvo faithfull perſons, the one a beggar, the other a Lord. &c. whereas it pleaſed Gods will, that Lazarus
ſhould begge, & that Ioſeph ſhould be a Lord or Prince
in Aegypt: this doth not proue that God hath anie reſpect
of perſons. For the hauing of reſpect of perſons hath
place in iudgements, where equall things are giuen to
vnequall perſons: and vnequall things to equall perſons.
Now, ſéeing that God reckoneth ſtill vpon this
rule of iudgement, That he would ſaue (all) that beléeue
in Chriſt, and puniſh with euerlaſting paines, (all) ſuch
as ſet light by his ſonne, and lie ſoaking in their ſinnes,
there is (I thinke) no reſpect of perſons in God.
               
               
                  XXX.
                  Furthermore, that there are not in God cōtrarie wils,
héereby it is manifeſt: bicauſe, as he is moſt true: yea,



euen truth it ſelfe, ſo he cannot away with a double heart,
but vtterlie condemneth it. Whereas therefore it is thus
written, God will that (all men) be ſaued: Againe, God
will that (none) periſh, but that (all) repent: the contradictories
of theſe propoſitions, are at no hand to be allowed,
which are theſe: God will that (not all men) be ſaued:
God will that (ſome) periſh, and that (not all) repent.
               
               
                  XXXI.
                  How then commeth it to paſſe (thou wilt ſaie) that
manie are damned, ſeing God will haue (all) ſaued? If we
haue an eie to the purpoſe of God in our creation, and of
ſending his ſonne into the world, then we ſhall ſée indeed
that the will of God is, that (none) ſhould periſh. But if
we looke againe to the euent or ſucceſſe, we ſhall ſée that
the will of God is, that (all) vnrepentant, (all) wilfull,
ſtubborne, and maliciouſlie minded perſons ſhall periſh.
An earthlie father would gladlie haue all his children
inherite: for this is the true fatherlie loue in a good
father after the fleſh. But if he perceiue anie of his
children ſo froward, vnrulie, diſordered, & diſobedient, that
neither rebukes with words, nor the ſmart of the whip,
or ſuch like ſharpe correction will make him amend, the
wiſe father putteth him by his inheritaunce, and reckoneth
him no more in the number of his children.
               
               
                  XXXII.
                  
                     Of this thing we haue a paterne before vs in Deuteronomie,Deut. 21. 18. 19. 20. 21.
                     where the Lord ſaith thus: Si genueris, &c.
If anie man haue a ſonne that is ſtubborne and diſobedient,
which will not hearken vnto the voice of
his father, nor the voice of his mother, and they haue
chaſtened him, and he would not obeie them: Then
ſhall his father and his mother take him, and bring him
out vnto the Elders of his citie, and vnto the gate of the
place where he dwelleth, and ſhall ſaie vnto the Elders



of his citie: Filius noſter iſte, &c. This our ſonne is ſtubborne
and diſobedient, and he will not obeie our admonition:
he is a riottour, and a drunkard. Then all the
men of his citie ſhall take him, & ſtone him with ſtones
vnto death, &c. Will not the Father heere haue his ſonne
ſtoned with ſtones euen to death, though nature ſhould
moue him fatherlie to loue him? After the ſame manner
dealeth God. For God, of his fatherlie goodneſſe, would
haue (all) made heires of euerlaſting life: but yet notwithſtanding,
he hath appointed the ſtubborne and obſtinate
their portion, euen perpetuall puniſhment.
                  
               
               
                  XXXIII.
                  Wherefore we muſt héedefullie make a difference betweene
the fatherlie will of God, which the Diuines call,
(Antecedent: that is, going before,) and that will of his
which followeth the wilfull ſtubborneſſe of men, which
is alſo called (Conſequent: that is, following after.)
               
               
                  XXXIIII.
                  The commaundement (for this is the third thing,
wherein we haue ſet foorth the will of God towards all
men) commendeth likewiſe vnto vs, the true fatherlie
will of God towards all. For it cannot be, that the will
of God ſhould wreſtle with his commandement. Wherefore,
when he biddeth the whole world heare his ſonne,
his will doubtleſſe is, that all ſhould heare him, & his will
is by hearing they ſhould haue faith. For the preaching
of the Goſpell requireth ſaith. Gods will alſo is, that ſuch
as beléeue ſhould be ſaued. Beſides this, the ſonne, who
is the wiſedome of his Father, ſendeth out his Diſciples
throughout the whole world, with this commandement,
Ite in mundum,
                     Luke. 16. 15. 16. 
                     &c. Goe ye into all the world, & preach
the Goſpell vnto (euery creature.) He that ſhall beleeue
and be baptiſed, ſhall be ſaued: but he that will not beleeue,
ſhall be damned. This commandement, forſomuch



as it reacheth vnto all, plainlie proueth, that Gods will
is to haue (all men) ſaued: but yet vpon the condition of
faith, as the promiſe ioined to the commandement declareth.
The Lord ſtraineth his voice, crieng: Venite, &c.
Come vnto me all ye that are wearie and laden,
                     Math. 11. 28. 
                     and I
will eaſe you. Héere doe both: namelie, the commandement
and the promiſe teſtifie, that the will of God is fatherlie,
that (all) ſhould come to Chriſt calling them, and
that (all) ſhould obtaine in him their ſaluation.
               
               
                  XXXV.
                  This therefore is boldlie and vndoubtedlie to be built
vpon, that the eternall and vniuerſall commandement of
God, is an vndeceiuable witneſſe of his will towardes
all men. Séeing therefore he commandeth all to heare
his ſonne, and to beléeue in him: his will ſurelie is thereafter,
that all ſhould heare, that all ſhould beléeue, that
all ſhould be iuſtified, that all ſhould be ſanctified, and
that all ſhould be ſaued. Be it farre from a Chriſtian
heart to thinke, that God forgiueth all men outwardlie
and in words: and hath an other will and ſecret meaning
of his owne inwardlie.
               
               
                  XXXVI.
                  But one or other will ſaie peraduenture: Faith is
the gift of God, and the worke of the holie Ghoſt: Ergo,
no man can beléeue, but he which receiueth faith from aboue.Ioh. 6. 44.
Againe, No man commeth to the ſonne, vnleſſe
the Father drawe him. This (I graunt) is verie true.
But when Saint Paule ſaith, Faith commeth by hearing,
                     Rom. 10. 17.
                     and hearing by the word of God, he meaneth
that the preaching of the Goſpell is the ordinarie inſtrument
to obteine faith: wherein God (according to his
promiſes) will be faithfull and effectuall, & will drawe
and knit vs vnto his ſonne by the word and the ſpirit.



But manie, when God draweth them, ſet ſhoulder againſt
him, whom they maie as well (I wiſſe) obeie.
This is plainlie proued by the complaint of Chriſt, lamenting
and wéeping ouer the Iewes,Math. 23. 37. for their frowardneſſe:
Quoties volui, &c. How often would I haue
gathered thee together,
                     Luke. 13. 35. 
                     as the henne gathereth her chickens,
and thou wouldeſt not? The like ſtubborneſſe,
and wilfull obſtinacie, Saint Stephen caſteth in the téeth
of the Iewes in his time,Act. 7. 51 ſaieng: Duri ce
                           •
                        uice, &c. Ye
ſtiffenecked and of vncircumciſed hearts and eares, ye
haue alwaies reſiſted the holie Ghoſt. And the Lord
by his Prophet Eſaie ſaith,Eſaie. 56. 2. 3. &c. 
                     Tota die, &c. I haue ſtretched
out my hands all the daie long, to a ſtubborne
people that haue reſiſted me.
                     Actes. 13. 45. 46. 47. By this ſelfe ſame teſtimonie
of authoritie, Saint Paule ſheweth the rebellion
of the Iewes, which he proueth to be the cauſe
of their caſting off. And although our minde, whiles
it is enlightened, prepared, altered, chaunged, diſpoſed
and ordered, is the patient or ſufferer: yet
notwithſtanding, in reſpect of conſent and agréement,
our will being taught by the word, and ſtrengthened
by the holie ſpirit, is the agent alſo or dooer.
               
               
                  XXXVII.
                  
                     Héerevnto ſerueth the example which Saint Auguſtine
ſetteth downe, of Nabuchodonoſor and Pharao,
in theſe words: Quantum ad, &c. In reſpect
of their nature, they were both men: in reſpect of
their dignitie, both Kings: in reſpect of their cauſe,
both keepers of Gods people in captiuitie: in reſpect
of their puniſhment, both gentlie admoniſhed and
warned by chaſtiſements. What then made their endings
diuerſe? Forſooth this, becauſe the one feeling
Gods hand, mourned in the remembrance of his owne
ſinne and iniquitie: the other wreſtled with free will



                     againſt the moſt mercifull good pleaſure of God.
                  
               
               
                  XXXVIII.
                  But héere speciall héede muſt be taken, leaſt anie
through wantonneſſe and long cuſtome of ſinning, abuſing
the gentleneſſe and long ſuffering of God, calling
them to repentaunce, purchaſe vnto themſelues Gods
heauie iudgement that in his wrath he forſake them, and
giue them ouer into a reprobate minde. When this is
come to paſſe, men waxe deafe, and hard of hearing the
word of God, drawing to themſelues ſuch a vſe and neceſſitie
of ſinning, by their owne will, that they can doe
nothing elſe but ſinne. For it fareth with them, as with
him, that pitcheth himſelfe headlong from the toppe of a
ſtéepe hill, which deede being once done, there is no calling
of it backe againe, becauſe it is paſt recouerie.
               
               
                  XXXIX.
                  We muſt therefore in time obeie the voice of God
calling vs, we muſt repent and walke warilie (as the
Prophet giueth vs counſell) before our God. For, he that
refuſeth to heare God, calling vs by his miniſters, runneth
with full raine, into the puniſhment of wilfull obſtinacie:
wherevpon followeth, that he, being more and
more faſt bound with the chaines of ſinne, till at length
he become ſenſeleſſe and ſorowleſſe, and ſo turne topſie
torue all the meanes of ſaluation. Heere therefore that
common verſe hath fit place:
                  
                     If thou to daie vnmeete be thought,
                     To morrowe doubtleſſe much more nought.
                  
               
               
                  XL.
                  The ſealing of grace commendeth vnto vs moſt manifeſtlie,
the fatherlie will of God: for this followeth in
the fourth place among thoſe markes & tokens, which ſet
before our eies, how fatherlie the will of God is towards
all men. For, whiles he biddeth (all nations) to be baptiſed,



hée will alſo (no doubt) that his grace and moſt
mercifull will be ſealed vnto (all nations.) For he would
neuer call (all nations) to Baptiſme, but that his will is to
giue ſaluation to (all nations) which he ſealeth with Baptiſme.
For this is an vnmouable ſequele. God offereth
ſaluation vnto (all:) Ergo his will is that (all) be ſaued.
               
               
                  XLI.
                  Now in that Baptiſme is but onelie literall in manie,
this commeth not to paſſe by the counſell & will of God,
who giueth his grace truelie, and ſealeth the ſame in
déede by Baptiſme: but through the default of men, who
ſhrinke ſhamefullie from the couenaunt which they
made with God in Baptiſme.
               
               
                  XLII.
                  For, as God promiſeth, and ſealeth his promiſe with
Baptiſme: ſo it is méete that man, on the other ſide, haue
faith in this behalfe. For, in euerie couenant, either partie
muſt and ſhall kéepe the conditions and appointments
of the couenant. And for that cauſe S. Peter defineth it, A
good conſcience making requeſt to God.
                     1. Pet. 
                           •
                         21. For God in giuing
Baptiſme, promiſeth grace: now, a conſcience in
faith agréeable, reſteth vpon the couenant, béeing well aſſured
of Ieſus Chriſts reſurrection.
               
               
                  XLIII.
                  Séeing therefore theſe proofes doe moſt plainlie laie
before vs the fatherlie will of God, which is the cauſe &
groundworke of our Predeſtination & election, requiſite
it is that we haue a ſtedfaſt beliefe of our ſaluation, and
that we betake our ſelues to the fatherlie will of God (as
to a moſt ſtrong & well fenſed tower) expreſſed & ſhewed
vnto vs, In the ſending of his ſonne, In the promiſe, I
                           •
                        
the commaundement, and in the ſealing of grace: not
paſſing a point for the opinions & decrées of the Stoikes,
touching Fortune or deſtinie, though they haue iollie
wiſe fellowes for their maintainers.
               
               
                  
                  XLIIII.
                  Furthermore, Saint Paule maketh two endes of our
predeſtination & election, writing to the Epheſians: wherof
the firſt is, (That we ſhould bee holie, and without
blame before him, that is to ſaie, that wée ſhould giue
our ſelues to holineſſe & harmeleſneſſe, & ſhould alwaies
haue before vs a good minde, purpoſe, and honeſt endeuour:
the laſt, (That the glorie of his grace might bee
praiſed of vs for euer.)
               
               
                  XLV.
                  It remaineth now, that wée ſpeake ſomewhat of the
vſe of the moſt ſwéete doctrine of Predeſtination and Election,
which is of two ſortes, as maie be gathered out
of Saint Paules Epiſtles to the Romanes & Epheſians.
The Apoſtle therefore writeth to the Romanes concerning
Predeſtination, that hee might conclude out of the
cauſe, the manner & meane, and the condition alſo of Predeſtination,
that the prerogatiue of the fleſh; & mans merits,
are no kinde of cauſe of ſaluation. The Apoſtle therfore
ouerthroweth the prerogatiue of the fleſh, & all merits
of men, that the mercie of God in Chriſt Ieſus, might
take place, and that a waie of ſaluation maie bée made
vnto all ſuch as refuſe not to beléeue in Chriſt. In his Epiſtle
to the Epheſians, he hath the ſame matter in hand,
to the end he might ſhew, that the Goſpell of Chriſt, is
no new vpſtart doctrine, ſet abroch of the Apoſtles: but
that the ſame was laid vp and kept in the boſome of God
himſelfe, before the world was made, and in due time
opened and deliuered to the world.
               
               
                  XLVI.
                  Beſides this double vſe; whereof the firſt ſerueth to
confirme righteouſneſſe fréelie giuen, and grace ſtretched
out & offered vnto all: the laſt, to commend the ancientneſſe
of the Goſpell: there is yet an other vſe, (which



Saint Paule toucheth in his Epiſtle to the Romans) That
the godlie maie be bolde,
                     Rom. 8. 33 34. 35. &c. 
                     that no croſſe, no affliction, no
miſerie: to bee ſhort, nothing whatſoeuer is able to
hinder or let the ſaluation of the beleeuers, which is builded
vpon the eternall ordinance of God.
                  
               
               
                  XLVII.
                  From hence ſpringeth an excéeding greate comfort in
the agonie of death, and an vnſpeakable reioiſing: inſomuch,
that the partie which lieth gaſping, and drawing to
his long home, maie ſaie, as it were in triumph: In Domino,
&c.
                     Pſal. 57. 10

                     Wherefore, according to Saint Paules aduiſe, we muſt
take a triall of our ſelues, Vos ipſos tentate, &c. Prooue
your ſelues (ſaith he) whether ye are in the faith:2. Cor. 13. 5. examine
your ſelues. Knowe you not your owne ſelues, how that

                  Theſe words of the Apoſtle teach vs a moſt certaine
and aſſured manner of trieng our ſelues, which is,



to proue and examine, whether we are in the faith, & whether
Chriſt dwelleth in vs. Which prouing doubtleſſe)
cannot from elſewhere proceede, than from the effects and
working of Chriſts ſpirit. For they that are lead by
Chriſts ſpirit, are his: and they that are lead by Chriſts
ſpirit, thinke, loue, followe, and excerciſe in life, the things
that are of Chriſt, eſteeming nothing more precious, than
ſo to order and frame their liues, as that God ſhould like
well and allow of them. Héerevpon ariſeth that ſharpe
combat of the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, neuer ceaſſing in
the godlie.

                     Milita, &c. Fight a good fight, keepe the faith, and a
good conſcience. For theſe are moſt aſſured teſtimonies
that Chriſt dwelleth in vs. For Where faith is, there the
conſcience is cleanſed from all dead works. Wherefore,
both a good conſcience, and a godlie purpoſe are vndoubted
warrants of a ſincere faith. Contrariwiſe, where the
conſcience is béeſmeared with ſinne, and an euill purpoſe
of dooing amiſſe, there is no faith at all, but a kinde of
Hypocriticall bragging of faith peraduenture,
which to bee moſt vaine and fooliſh, the
workes themſelues ſpringing from
the ſame, doe ſufficientlie declare,
and Saint Iames
alſo ſaith no

            ¶THE SECOND CHAPTER.
            
               THE SVMME OF THE SEcond
Chapter.
               IT pleaſed God to quicken and make aliue in Chriſt,
by grace through faith, not the Iewes onelie, a
people dead to ſinne, and the children of wrath: but alſo
the Gentiles, which in times paſt were not of Gods
houſholde: taking away all difference betwixt the Iewes
and the Gentiles, and making peace betwixt them both:
which he hath done to this end, that he might ſhew vnto
all ages and poſterities his plentifull and euerlaſting
grace towards the faithfull, who are builded vpon the
foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Chriſt béeing
the corner ſtone. Or thus more brieflie: God vouchſafeth
to take the Iewes and the Gentiles, great ſinners, to
grace and fauour, for his ſonnes ſake Chriſt Ieſus.
            
            
               ¶THE ORDER OF THE SEcond
Chapter.
               THe beginning of this Chapter doth fitlie agrée with
the end of the Chapter going before. For the Apoſtle
héere applieth a generall doctrine to the Iewes and the
Gentiles: that is to ſaie, turneth ouer the generalitie,
to the ſpecialties. For, in this Chapter hée repeateth in
particular, that which in the former Chapter hée ſette
downe in generall: howbeit, in an other forme and manner
of ſpeach, for the more approuing of the matter, and
giuing of it greater force. Now he vſeth a compariſon of
the ſtate of man, which is of two ſortes: namelie, of the
former, to wit, before grace: and of the latter: that is, vnder
grace. Before grace, men were dead in their trāſgreſſions
and ſins, vnder grace they were quickened & made
aliue by Chriſt, through faith. This compariſon firſt of



all, as in the propoſition, he applieth vnto them both: afterwards,
he turneth it both to the Iewes, and alſo to
the Epheſians: adding therevnto a certaine ſhort Aphoriſme,
wherein he laieth wide open the ſumme of ſaluation.
Then he applieth the ſame compariſon more at large to
the Gentiles, vnder the name of the Epheſians: declaring
how the Gentiles, who in times paſt were ſtraungers
from the Commonwelth of God, are made Citizens with
the Saints, and of Gods houſhold: all which is wrought
by the croſſe of Chriſt, the vertue and power whereof is
made knowne vnto men, by the preaching of the Goſpell.
Laſtlie, he ioineth héerewithall a concluſion, with a
notable enlargement. All theſe things tend wholie héerevnto,
that the Epheſians might eſtéeme and thinke of the
grace of the Goſpell, according to the worthineſſe therof,
leaſt they being made partakers of ſo heauenlie a myſterie,
ſhould vnaduiſedlie fall awaie from it againe.
            
            
               ¶THE EXPOSITION OF THE SEcond
Chapter, with the obſeruation of doctrines
therein conteined.
               
                  
                     Verſe. 1. &. 2.
                  
                  
                     1 And you hath he quickened,
that vvere dead in treſpaſſes and
ſinnes.
                     2 Wherein in time paſt, ye vvalked,
according to the courſe of
this vvorld, and after the Prince
that ruleth in the aire, euen the
ſpirit, that novv worketh in the
children of diſobedience.
                  
                  And you when you were dead
in the treſpaſſes and ſinnes
wherein you walked, according
to the trade of this world,
after the Prince that ruleth
in the aire, euen the ſpirit,
which now worketh in the children
of vnbeliefe.
                  
                     ALthough the wordes of this ſpeach or
ſentence, ſtand out of order: yet notwithſtanding
there is no diſorder of matter.
Wherfore, to the intent it maie be perfect
and full, the Nominatiue caſe and
the Verbe, muſt be fetcht out of the



words which followe, after this maner, (God the Father
hath quickened you together with Chriſt, when you
were dead in ſinnes.) Now let vs weie the ſentence well.
In the ende of the former Chapter, the Apoſtle calleth
Chriſt, (The head of the Church:) and héere he placeth
the Epheſians vnder Chriſt the head, that they might aduiſedlie
cōſider, to how great dignitie & glorie they are called,
by the goſpel. Now, yt this paſſing great benefit might
become more ſweet to the Epheſians, he ſetteth downe a
compariſon of a double ſtate, common to the Iewes and
the Epheſians, that is to ſaie, the Gentiles. The former
ſtate is of them both before their conuerſion: the latter after
their conuerſion. Before their conuerſion, S. Paule auoucheth,
that they both were dead in treſpaſſes & ſinnes.
After their conuerſion, hée ſaith, that they were diſcharged
from the guiltineſſe of their ſinnes, and were
quickened in Chriſt. By (Treſpaſſes) vnderſtand the
beginnings as it were of ſinnes: and by (Sinnes) the
cuſtome of ſinning. And that the Epheſians were dead
in treſpaſſes and ſinnes; before their conuerſion, he proueth
by two reaſons. For, hée ſendeth them both to
experience or proofe, and alſo to the cauſe and Prince
of all euill and miſchiefe. Experience would not ſuffer
them to be ignorant, how defiled and vncleane they
were (According to the courſe of the whole world,) béeing
indéede plunged ouer head and eares in the bottomleſſe
pit of ſinnes. For (According to the courſe of this
world,) ſignifieth the trade, faſhion, cuſtome, and vſe
of this worlde, which delighteth in nothing elſe but
in ſinnes.
                  They are not ſaid, in this place, (To bee dead
in treſpaſſes and ſinnes) whoſe ſinne i
                        •••
                     ut out: but they
whom ſinne hath wounded & ſlaine, as guiltie before the
iudgement ſeat of God. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſpiritual
death, which is a ſeparation of Gods ſpirit & grace from
man. From whence alſo yt death, which we call the firſt



death: to wit, the departing of the ſoule from the bodie:
and the ſecond death, which is death euerlaſting doe
procéede. Let vs now ſée what doctrine is miniſtred vnto
vs out of this place.
                  Firſt, we learne héerehence, that men deſtitute of
Gods grace, can doe nothing elſe but ſinne, in euerie
thing that they take in hand. Secondlie, that Sathan
hath full ſwaie in the children of vnbeliefe: that is to
ſaie, in them which beléeue not the Goſpell. Thirdlie,
that the life and conuerſation of men, is a teſtimonie
and witneſſe, by what ſpirit they are lead, whether by
the ſpirit of God, or the ſpirit of the Diuell. Fourthlie,
that ſuch as beléeue in Chriſt, are ſet frée from the tyrannie
of Sathan, that hée hath no power ouer them, to
egge them, as hée liſt, to this ſinne and that.
                  There are two cauſes of ſinnes noted héere, to wit,
(The courſe of this world,) and (The Prince that ruleth
in the aire.) But of theſe I will ſpeake héereafter,
when I ſhall ioine vnto theſe, other cauſes alſo, as the
words of the Apoſtle ſhall moue me: to the end wée may
haue all the cauſes of ſinnes in the vnbeleeuers noted together;
and ſo with the greater diligence take héede of
them.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 3.
                  
                  3 Among vhom vve alſo had
our conuerſation in time paſt,
in the luſts of our fleſh, in fulfilling
the vvill of the fleſh, and
of the minde: and were by nature
the children of vvrath, as
vvell as others.
                  Among whom likewiſe all wee
were ſometimes conuerſant, in
the concupiſcence of our fleſh,
dooing the will of the fleſh,
and of the minde, and we were
by nature the children of wrath
as well as others.
                  THis is ſpoken by waie of application, and ſerueth to
this end, that the Epheſians looking vpon the Iewes,
as vpon a paterne or example, might hope well. For, ſéeing
ye Apoſtle ſaith, That the Iews were no leſſe giuen to



the lewd luſts of the fleſh, and vnto doing the will of their
wicked thoughts, whereby they became the children of
wrath, by the like corruption of nature which reigned in
the reſt, than the Epheſians or other Gentiles, and
yet affirmeth that they were taken to grace, and receiued
into fauour, it putteth the Epheſians in good hope & comfort,
that they ſhould be receiued into fauour alſo, and be
ſaued, through the ſelfe ſame goodneſſe of God.
                  Héerehence let vs learne the vſe of ſuch examples as
the holie ſcripture commendeth vnto vs. For they (to
ſpeake brieflie) beſides the doctrine which is to be gathered
by them, ſet before our eies, Gods iudgement and
his mercie, that we might be inſtructed and taught, hauing
ſuch godlie examples of them both, in preſent
view.
                  (The luſt of the fleſh) is that, which ſpringeth from the
corruption and naughtineſſe of the fleſh, that is, of originall
ſinne. For héere this word (Fleſh) ſignifieth the whole
man not yet renewed. In the (Fleſh) dwelleth (Luſt,)
whereby man is egged to do thoſe things, which the fleſh
and the wicked thoughts of the ſame doe like. The Apoſtle
in this place ſéemeth to make two parts of a corrupt
and naughtie nature, to wit: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     :
that is to ſaie: the fleſh, and the minde, or the vnderſtanding
part. By the firſt is meant that part of the
minde, which the Philoſophers call, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the appetite,
or deſire, which is void of reaſon. By the laſt, that
part which they name, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the reaſonable part.
Wherevpon it commeth to paſſe, that the whole man, before
the grace of regeneration, is by nature, that is to ſay,
not by cuſtome and imitation, but by neceſſitie of birth &
conception, after the fall of our firſt parents, the childe of
wrath, that is to ſaie, by the iuſt iudgement of God, angrie
and diſpleaſed with him, guiltie of euerlaſting death,
through ſinne. For the childe of wrath is Paſſiuelie taken,
and not Actiuelie. For, he is not héere ſaid to be the



childe of wrath, which is angrie: but he which ſuffereth
anger by deſart, and therefore is appointed vnto puniſhment.
Alſo before, the childe of wilfulneſſe and ſtubborneſſe
is Actiuelie taken: for it ſignifieth one that is froward,
malicious, diſordered, and a wreſtler againſt the
word of God and his will. It is to be noted therfore, that
this word Filius, Childe, ioined with Genitiue caſes of
Nownes appellatiues, is ſomtimes Actiuelie taken, that
is to ſaie: ſignifies a man giuen to that propertie or qualitie,
which by the Genitiue caſe is expreſſed: & other ſometimes
againe, it is Paſſiuelie taken, that is to ſaie, ſignifieth
him that is made ſubiect to ſuffer that thing which the
Genitiue caſe declareth. In this place let vs firſt of all
marke, how miſerable our ſtate and condition is without
Chriſt. For, we are carried a maine into all kinde of ſin
and wickedneſſe, euen as the luſt of the fleſh moueth vs, &
not onlie ſummoned, but alſo tried & found guiltie before
Gods iudgement ſeate, as offenders deſeruing the wrath
of God, and eternall death. Let this thinking vpon our
euill caſe admoniſh vs, how swéete the Lord is, and how
comfortable his word, who by his grace deliuereth vs
out of theſe daungers, and remoueth vs into his glorious
kingdome. Beſides that we haue ſaid, by this and
the former part we maie gather the cauſes of ſinnes bearing
full ſwaie in the world, which kéepe order in following
one another.
                  The firſt is the fleſh it ſelfe. Now this word (Fleſh)
is diuerſlie taken in the Scripture. For, ſometimes it
hath a proper, and ſometimes againe a figuratiue or
borrowed meaning. When it is properlie taken, it ſignifieth
the fleſhie ſubſtance of liuing creatures: as when
Saint Paule ſaith thus,1. Cor. 15. 39. 
                     Non omnis caro eadem, &c.
All fleſh is not the ſame fleſh, but there is one fleſh of
men, and another fleſh of beaſts, and another of fiſhes,
and another of birdes. It is figuratiuelie taken alſo,
ſometimes by the figure Synecdoche, and ſignifieth the



whole man,1. Cor. 1. 29. as in that place of Saint Paule, Vt non, &c.
That all fleſh maie not boaſt, that is to ſaie, man or anie
other liuing creature: as in that place alſo of Geneſis,
Finis,
                     Gen. 6. 13. 
                     &c. An ende of all fleſh is come before me. Sometimes
by the figure Metaphora: for as the fleſh doeth
properlie ſignifie, a thing ſenſible, which maie be fealt and
ſéene: ſo Metaphoricallie it ſignifieth the outward ſhewe
or appearaunce of things: as in that place, where it is
ſaid:Ioh. 8. 15. 
                     Vos iudicatis, &c. Ye iudge after the fleſh. Sometimes
by the figure Metalepſis: for, bicauſe the fleſh is
ſoft, it is otherwhiles taken for ſoft, and ſet againſt hardneſſe:
as in that ſaieng of the Lord, Auferam, &c. I will
take from their fleſh,
                     Ezek. 11. 19. & cap. 36. 26 
                     their ſtonie heart: and I will giue
them a fleſhie heart: that is to ſaie, a ſoft heart, not reſiſting
God, but beléeuing in the word of God. Sometimes
by the figure Metonymia, for ſomething to him belonging,
and that diuerſlie: otherwhiles for the iudgement
of reaſon,Math. 16. 17. as in that ſaieng, Caro & ſanguis, &c.
Fleſh and bloud, hath not opened this vnto thee, that is
to ſaie, by the iudgement of reaſon thou perceiueſt not,
that I am the Sonne of God, and the true Meſsias.
Sometimes for the beginning of mans corrupt nature:
that is to ſaie, for originall ſinne, as in Saint
Paules Epiſtles euerie where maie be ſéene:Rom. 8. 6. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     :
that is to ſaie, The wiſedome of
the fleſh is death.
                     Rom. 8. 13 Againe, Si ſecundum, &c. If ye liue after
the fleſh, ye ſhall die. And in that ſpeach of the Lord,
Quod natum eſt,
                     Ioh. 3. 6. 
                     &c. That which is borne of the fleſh,
is fleſh. And in this ſenſe is the word (Fleſh) taken,
when we make it the firſt cauſe of ſinnes, reigning and
ruling among men. Againſt this is ſet, as it were
flat contrarie, the ſpirit of the new borne: that is
to ſaie, a motion or working, which the holie ſpirit
ſtirreth vp in the hearts of the beleeuers, which
is the firſt cauſe of godlie purpoſes and exerciſes in
men.
                  
                     
The ſecond cauſe of ſinnes ſwaieng in ſuch ſort, is
the luſt of the fleſh, whereby the fleſh, or originall ſinne
is made luſtie & effectuall to bring foorth verie ill fruits.
The force of this luſt all men féele & trie in themſelues.
Againſt this is ſet, as flat contrarie, the luſt of the ſpirit,
which hath place onelie in the godlie, and in ſuch as haue
chaunged their copie by repentaunce: and this is the ſecond
cauſe of godlie purpoſes and exerciſes in the good.
                  The third cauſe of treſpaſſes and ſinnes is the vnderſtanding,
or (as Saint Paule ſaith) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : that is,
the minde: when the minde or vnderſtanding being attainted,
& raiſed vp of luſt, beginneth to talke and reaſon
with it ſelfe of thoſe things, wherevnto the luſt moueth
and pricketh it. Againſt this is ſet (as flat contrarie)
the vnderſtanding of the ſpirit.
                  The fourth cauſe of ſinnes and offenſes is, the will
of the fleſh, and thoughts of the ſame: as Saint Paule
ſaith. And although the will ſometimes replieth vpon
the reaſoning of the fleſh: yet notwithſtanding, in them
that are not new borne, it is violentlie caried away (yea
verie often) with the force of the fleſh: euen as a Pinniſſe
or ſmall Barke is with contrarie windes and weather,
though the mariners doe what they can for the ſafegard
of the ſame. Héereto ſerueth the ſaieng of Medea: Laudo

                           •••
                        liora, &c.
                  
                  
                     The better I allow as true,
                     But yet the worſt I will enſue.
                  
                  Againſt this will of the fleſh, and the thoughts of the
ſame, is ſet (as flat contrarie) the will of the ſpirit,
commanding things, which the fleſh can in no wiſe awaie
with: and this is the fourth cauſe of godlie purpoſes and
actions in the good.
                  The fift cauſe of ſinnes is, (as Saint Paule ſaith,)

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , The common courſe of this world:
that is to ſaie, the peruerſe and froward faſhions of this



world, infinite offenſes dailie giuen, and examples of moſt
miſchieuous déedes without number. This euill cuſtome
of the world, is a kinde of fodder & ſuſtenaunce of ſinne:
wherewith manie among them that were minded to
feare God, being fedde fat, ware wilde, and kicke vp the
heele againſt him. Héerehence ſpringeth this, that the euill
manners of parents, is ths euill bringing vp of their
children. For, whiles men doe amiſſe, and liue after the
manner of the multitude, they excuſe themſelues by example,
as they in olde time did, who ſetting good Noe at
naught, were paid home at length, féeling in the floud due
puniſhment for their diſobedience. Againſt this froward
and wilfull wicked world, maie be ſet (as flat contrarie)
as well the examples of holie Angels, and other Gods
good creatures in heauen: as alſo of Saints and holie people,
which eſtéemed nothing more pleaſant, nothing more
precious, and nothing better in their life, than to be obedient
vnto God by faith.
                  The ſixt cauſe of ſins ouerrunning the world, is (The
Prince that ruleth in the aire,)Pſa. 109. 7 that is to ſaie the Diuell.
For he,Math. 27. 4. 5. as the holie hiſtorie beareth witneſſe of traiterous
Iudas,
                     Mark. 14. 21. 43. 44. 45. entreth into mens hearts, and pulleth them
forward into diuers ſinnes and offenſes, that they
ſhould not be ſaued. Againſt him (as flat contrarie) maie
be ſet the Prince that ruleth in the Church,Luke. 22. 22. 47. 48. Chriſt Ieſus,
who giueth his holie ſpirit to them that aſke it. And
he is the firſt and chiefeſt author:Ioh. 17. 12. & Chap. 18. 3. 4. 5. &c. yea, the cauſe of cauſes
of all godlie purpoſes and exerciſes whatſoeuer, in
them that are turned, and become new creatures.
                  Hetherto we haue ſhewed,Act. 1. 16 17. 18. &c.
                      what be the cauſes of treſpaſſes
and ſinnes ouerſpreading the world, againſt all
which, the onelie & ſouereigne remedie is Faith in Ieſus
Chriſt.1. Ioh. 5. 4. 
                     This is the victorie which ouercommeth the
world, euen your faith. In this are conteined the cauſes
of doing good déedes, which cauſes I haue alreadie rehearſed:
in this is Chriſt the conquerour of the kingdome



of darkeneſſe poſſeſſed: in this we are made new men,
and regenerated: by this a new ſpirit, wherewith we
withſtand the fleſh, is obteined: finallie, by this the whole
bodie of ſinne is ſtriken dead and mortified.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 4. 5. 6. &. 7.
                  
                  
                     4 But God, vvhich is rich in
mercie, through his great loue,
vvherevvith he loued vs,
                     5 Euen vvhen vve vvere dead
by ſinnes, hath quickened vs
together in Chriſt; by vvhoſe
grace ye are ſaued,
                     6 And hath raiſed vs vp together,
& made vs ſit together in
the heauenlie places, in Chriſt
Ieſus,
                     7 That he might ſhew in the
ages to come, the exceeding riches
of his grace, through his
kindneſſe tovvards vs in Chriſt
Ieſus.
                  
                  But God, which is rich
in mercie, for the great loue
ſake wherewith he loued vs,
euen when we were dead
by ſinne, hath quickened
vs together with Chriſt.
(For by grace are ye ſaued)
and hath made vs ſit together
in heauenlie things in
Chriſt Ieſus, that he might
ſhew in times to come, the
abundant riches of his grace,
in kindeneſſe to vs ward in
Chriſt Ieſu.
                  THis is an amplification or enlargement, and an Antitheſis
or oppoſition, whereby the common ſtate of
the Iewes and Gentiles vnder grace is declared. Before,
the Apoſtle ſpake ſeuerallie of them both: now he
comprehendeth and putteth them both together, that he
might ſhew the equall condition and ſtate of them both.
The ſumme of the ſentence is this. As God made the
Iewes partakers of heauenlie glorie, euen thorough his
méere grace & goodneſſe: ſo did he alſo the Gentiles. But
the Apoſtle, to the ende he might enlarge his ſpeach, amplifieth
the ſame according to his manner, by the place of
cauſes and effects: rehearſing the ſelfe ſame things here,
which he ſpake in the firſt Chapter touching this myſterie.
For in the firſt place he ſetteth downe the principall
ground, or chiefe cauſe of our reſtitution and recouerie: to
wit, the méere mercie of God, wherewith he loued vs in



Chriſt. After that, he maketh mention of the fruites of
this mercie, which is of thrée ſorts: namelie, of life, of reſurrection,
and of heauenlie grace in Chriſt. For the life
of Chriſt, his reſurrection, and his ſitting in heauenlie
places, is a certeine aſſurance, a pledge, and merit of our
life, our reſurrection, and heauenlie grace. For ſeeing we
are the members of Chriſt, we ſhall be partakers of the
ſame happineſſe and glorie with our head. And as the Apoſtle
maketh Chriſt the meane, by whom theſe ſo great
benefits are conueied vnto vs: ſo he maketh the declaring
of Gods grace towards men, the end of theſe benefits,
giuen and beſtowed vpon vs. Neither is this a declaring
of Gods temporall goodneſſe, but an vnſpeakable
token and ſigne of his perpetuall goodneſſe. For, that
which Chriſt once did, that remaineth for euer, as an aſſured
warrant of Gods goodneſſe towards vs. Now, touching
that which is incloſed in a Parentheſis, (By grace
ye are ſaued,) it is indéed a verie ſhort ſaieng, howbeit the
ſame conteineth the whole ſumme and cauſe of all Gods
good graces, powred vpon vs through Chriſt: the benefit
it ſelfe, is (Saluation:) the cauſe is (Grace:) that is, the
honour of God, which is grounded in Chriſt, and from
him conueied vnto vs, as from the head to the members.
Héere againe is commended vnto vs a generall doctrine
of the Church of God: to wit, that vnto God alone, for
Chriſt his ſonnes ſake, our redemption is to be aſcribed.
By which doctrine their vanitie is diſproued, who referre
the benefit of our ſaluation to mens workes & merits, either
going before, or following after, or ioined with iuſtification.
But this doctrine is treated vpon more at large,
in the point or diſcourſe following: and it is amplified
by it owne proper cauſes, vnproper cauſes put apart.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 8. 9. &. 10
                  
                  
                     8 For by grace are ye ſaued,
through faith, (and that not
of your ſelues: it is the gift of
God.)
                     
                        
9 Not of vvorkes, leaſt anie
man ſhould boaſt himſelfe.
                     10 For we are his vvorkemanſhip,
created in Chriſt
Ieſus vnto good workes, that
vve ſhould vvalke in them.
                  
                  By grace are ye ſaued through
faith (and this is not of your
ſelues, it is the gift of God,)
not of workes, leaſt anie man
ſhould boaſt. For we are his
workemanſhip created in Chriſt
Ieſus vnto good workes, which
God ordein'd (or prepared) before,
that we ſhould walke in
them.
                  HEere the Apoſtle gathereth as it were into one Aphoriſme,
the whole matter which hetherto he hath handeled:
to the ende it maie the better be ſéene, and that
the circumſtances and cauſes alſo being placed together,
might the eaſier be borne in remembraunce, and vnderſtood.
Firſt therefore he ſetteth downe (Grace) whereby
God taketh vs againe vnto him, of his meere mercie, for
Chriſts ſake, who is the matter of our ſaluation. The
effect of this grace, he maketh to be (Saluation:) that is,
our iuſtification, and our glorification. He addeth the inſtrument
whereby the ſame is receiued, euen (Faith.)
For by faith we receiue the promiſe of ſaluation which
the Goſpell doth preſent and offer vnto vs.
                  But bicauſe falſe Apoſtles, ſworne enimies to grace,
haue for the moſt part attributed the benefit of ſaluation
to the works of men: the Apoſtle diſproueth them, taking
his reaſon from the contrarie cauſe. Saluation ſaith he, is
the gift of God, Ergo, it is not of workes: For theſe two
can agrée in no caſe: To haue ſomwhat of frée gift: and,
To obteine the ſame by deſart of workes. This is auouched
by S. Paule,
                     Rom. 11. 6 ſaieng: Si ex gratia, &c. If it be of grace,
it is no more of workes, or elſe were grace no more grace:
but if it be of workes, it is no more grace, or elſe were
worke no more worke. How often ſoeuer therefore our
ſaluation is ſaid to be either the gift of God, or to be of
grace, or to be obteined by faith, or to be ours without
works, all manner of merit in man, touching the worke
of our ſaluation, is tript and throwne vnder foote.
                  Now, why ſaluation is not of works, he ſheweth a reaſon
in theſe words, (Leaſt anie man ſhould boaſt.) Herto ſerueth



that ſaieng alſo,Rom. 3. 27 
                     Vbi eſt gloriatio, &c. Where is then
the reioiſing? It is excluded. By what lawe? Of workes?
Naie. But by the law of faith. For that which is obtained
by faith, is altogether of frée gift, & therfore it excludeth all
reioiſing or boaſting: contrariwiſe, whatſoeuer wée get
by our owne workes and trauell, that is matter to vs
of boaſting.
                  Furthermore, bicauſe the fleſhlie minded, hearing this
benefit of ſaluation to be ours by frée gift, and without
workes or merits, that is to ſaie, without the deſart of
workes, ſnatch at it, and therevpon take full libertie to
ſinne: the Apoſtle méeteth them in the mouth, and laieth
againſt them, the verie next or néereſt end of ſaluation,
which he did beate vpon in the firſt Chapter: namelie,
our ſanctification. (For we are his workmanſhip, created
in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good workes, that we ſhould
walke in them.) The word (For) is oftentimes ſo taken in
an obiection, that it ſéemeth to carrie a reaſon or cauſe
of a thing with it. But yet notwithſtanding, it doth not
render a reaſon or cauſe of the former ſpeach, but rather
giueth a priuie aunſwere to the aduerſaries obiection.
For when Saint Paule ſaith, that we haue ſaluation
without workes, one or other maie thus obiect and ſaie:
If we obtaine ſaluation without workes, then what néed
we doe good workes? The Apoſtle aunſwereth that it
followeth not. For we are created in Chriſt vnto (good
workes.) And thus the word (For) conteineth a reaſon to
reproue the replie of the aduerſaries: whoſe obiection
the Apoſtle aunſwereth in this place. The obſeruation
of the vſe of this word (For) is profitable, that we may
knowe and vnderſtand whereto the ſame ſerueth.
                  Thus farre touching the meaning of this Aphoriſme.
Now let vs to the ſpecialities of the ſame in due order.
The firſt, The frée goodneſſe of God is the onelie cauſe
of our ſaluation. The ſecond, By faith alone we are made
partakers of ſaluation freelie giuen. The third, Mans



workes are neither the cauſes, nor the merites, nor part
of our ſaluation. The fourth, Good workes are ioined
with faith, as a neceſſarie and vnſeparable accident. The
fift, All mans reioiſing or boaſting in the worke of ſaluation
is excluded. The ſixt, Regeneration or new birth
in Chriſt, is the cauſe of good works. Theſe ſixe ſpecialties
are in the words of this ſhort péece of doctrine, which
containe the principall and chiefe grounds of Chriſtian
Religion, & confute manie foule and groſſe errours. For,
firſt of all, they are confuted héere, which will haue ſaluation
to ſtand vpon faith and works together, as vpon the
parts thereof. But Saint Paule in this place doth manifeſtlie
exclude works, and ſetteth downe faith, not as a
part, or as a cauſe of ſaluation, but as an inſtrument only.
                  Secondlie, they are alſo confuted by this ſaieng of S.
Paule, who, whiles they graunt with vs, that men are iuſtified
by faith alone, exclude works, not onelie as cauſes
and merits, but alſo as neceſſarie conſequents: as though
good works were not neceſſarilie required in ſuch as are
iuſtified, and haue obtained ſaluation by frée gift. Againſt
whom S. Paule in this place doth plainlie reaſon, requiring
(Workes) as a neceſſarie conſequent of ſaluation,
and as a neceſſarie and vnſeparable accident of regeneration.
Workes therefore (as S. Barnard ſaith) are not
the cauſe of reigning,
                     Rom. 3. 28 
                     but a waie to reigne: not the cauſe
of our comming to Gods kingdome, but a waie thervnto.
                  
                  Furthermore, by this ſaieng of S. Paule are ouerthrowen
all preparing workes (as they terme them) to
iuſtification. For if our works were required, as preparatiues,
then would not S. Paule haue ſpoken thus, Abſque
operibus, Without works. Let vs therefore beare awaie,
& hold faſt this ſpeach of ye Apoſtle, wherby we are
inſtructed in our ſaluation, & armed againſt the errours,
both of the Papiſts, and the Phariſies: beſides that, wée
are warned what our dutie is, which haue obtained ſaluation
fréelie through Chriſt.

                     11 Wherefore remember,
that ye being in time paſt Gentiles
in the fleſh, & called vncircumciſion
of them, which are
called circumciſion in the fleſh
made vvith hands,
                     12. That ye vvere, I ſaie, at that
time vvithout Chriſt, and vvere
aliants from the Cōmonvvealth
of Iſrael, and vvere ſtraungers
from the couenants of promiſe,
& had no hope, & vvere vvithout
God in the vvorld:
                     13 But novv in Chriſt Ieſus, ye
vvhich once vvere farre off, are
novv made neere by the bloud
of Chriſt.
                  
                  VVherefore bee yee mindfull,
that yee were Gentiles in the
fleſh, which were called vncircumciſion
of them that are called
circumciſion in the fleſh
made with hands, bicauſe at
that time yee were without
Chriſt, aliens (or foreners)
from the Commonwealth of Iſrael,
and ſtraungers of the
teſtaments of promiſe, hauing
no hope, and without God in
the world. But now in Chriſt
Ieſu, ye which ſometime were
farre off, are made nigh in the
bloud of Chriſt.
                  THis is an other part of the compariſon: to wit, of the
ſtate of the Gentiles before grace, and vnder grace:
which part of the compariſon, doth not in verie deed, but
after a certaine manner onelie differ from the former:
which manner ſtandeth vpon circumſtances. Nowe the
Apoſtle ſaith, that the Gentiles did differ from the people
of God in two circumſtances: firſt, in the ſigne: ſecondlie,
in grace. In the ſigne, bicauſe that, as the Gentiles
were vncircumciſed, in witneſſe of their vncleanneſſe: ſo
the Iewes had the circumciſion of promiſe. In grace, bicauſe
that, as the Gentiles were (Without Chriſt,) who
is the onelie waie of ſaluation, (Out of the Commonwealth
of Iſrael,) that is to ſaie, not of Gods people,
(Straungers from the couenants of promiſe,) that is to
ſaie, without the witneſſes and teſtaments, wherby God
bound himſelfe to his people, (Without hope, and without
God,) that is to ſaie, men liuing in the world, vtterlie
voide of Gods feare & ſeruice: ſo the Iewes had all theſe
things of grace. For they had the promiſe of the Meſſias,
they were in the Commonweath of Iſrael, they were
heires of the couenants of promiſe, they had the hope of
ſaluation, and they knewe God.
                  
                     
To this he addeth an Antitheſis or oppoſition, teaching
that the Gentiles are now reconciled vnto God, by
the bloud of Chriſt, & receiued into the Commonwealth
and houſhold of God, through the ſame Ieſus Chriſt:
Yee (ſaith the Apoſtle) which once were farre off▪
                     
(namelie from grace) are now made neere, to wit, by the
meanes of Chriſts bloud. All theſe things ſerue to this
ende, that he might beate downe the pride & 
                        •
                     igh mindedneſſe
of the Epheſians: and that he might awake them,
to wonder at this ſo great a treaſure: leaſt béeing vnthankefull
to God, they ſhould fall againe into their olde
ſuperſtition: that is to ſaie, leaſt forgetting Chriſts benefits,
they ſhould ſlide backe from the Goſpell, being deceiued
with the wilie ſlights of Sathan and the world.
This is the ſumme of all. Nowe, to touch the circumſtances
of the text particularlie, which néedeth both expounding,
and aduiſe, we will thus procéede. Firſt, hée
willeth the Epheſians to (Remember.) And whie ſo? Becauſe,
when men are aduaunced from a lowe degrée to a
higher, they quicklie & eaſilie (God wot) forget their former
ſtate. By this aduiſe therefore, or warning, it is the
Apoſtles minde to humble the Epheſians, & to admoniſh
them of conſtancie, of continuance, & of thankeſgiuing:
that they might diſcharge themſelues by their duetifulneſſe,
and giue God the glorie, to whom it doth of right belong,
for powring vpon them ſo manie great benefits, and
that of his frée goodneſſe and liberalitie.
                  Héerehence haue we alſo, which liue at this daie, to be
warned and well aduiſed, that becauſe God hath vouchſafed,
of his méere goodneſſe, to call vs out of the darkeneſſe
of Poperie, into the cléere light of the Goſpell, that
we liue worthie of ſo greate grace, and by the hainouſneſſe
of our ſinnes prouoke not Gods wrath againſt vs,
leaſt he iuſtlie and deſeruedlie take that from vs againe,
béeing vnthankfull, which before he gaue vs of his
good grace, when we were, vnworthie. That is a verie



euill vnthankfulneſſe, when men vouchſafe not to giue
men thanks for their good turnes: but farre worſe, & more
abhominable is that, whereby we ſhew our ſelues vnthankfull
vnto God, who would that his déere ſon ſhould
die for vs, that we might liue. Beſides this, when the Apoſtle
ſaith thus, (Gentiles in the fleſh, and called vncircumciſion
of them which are called circumciſion in the
fleſh, made with hands,) he noteth two things: Firſt,
that the Iewes called the Gentiles, by the reprochfull
name of vncircumciſion: which Iewes indéed bragged
much more than they néeded, of that outward marke in
their ſkinne or fleſh. Of this bragging and boſting, there
is an example in Geneſis:
                     Gen. 34. 14. 
                     Non poſſumus, &c. We cannot
(ſaie the ſonnes of Iacob) doe this thing, to giue our
ſiſter to an vncircumciſed man.
                     1. Sam. 16. 26, &. 36 Againe, Dauid being full
of Gods ſpirit, ſpeaketh of Goliath in this manner, Et
quid, &c. Who is this vncircumciſed Philiſtine, that hee
ſhould reuile the hoaſt of the liuing God? This vncircumciſed
Philiſtine ſhall bee as one of th
                           •
                        m, ſeeing he
hath railed on the hoaſt of the liuing God. Againe, S.
Paule in this place maketh two ſorts of Iewes, and two
ſorts of Gentiles. For ſome of the Iewes were circumciſed
in the fleſh, and in the ſpirit: as Moſes, Aaron, Ioſue,
Phinees, Abraham, Iſaach, Iacob, Ioſeph, Dauid, Ioſias,
Daniel, Simeon, Nathanael, &c. to be ſhort, all that
receiued the outward circumciſion of the fleſh, with faithfulnes
of heart in the Meſſias promiſed. Some were circumciſed
in the fleſh onlie: to wit, they which had the outward
marke without the ſpirit, ſuch were manie: yea, the
moſt of ye Iewes, ſpeciallie at the time of ye Lords cōming:
the firſt are called (The children of promiſe:) the laſt,
(The children of the fleſh:) which names the Apoſtle
giueth to them both. In like manner Paule maketh two
ſorts of Gentiles. Some were Gentiles onelie in ye fleſh,
hauing vncircumciſion, the badge of their Gentiliſme:
howbeit in ſpirit they were circumciſed: namelie, which



had the vncircumciſion of the fleſh, with a liuelie faithfulneſſe
in and vpon the frée promiſe of ſaluation. In the
number of theſe were Iob, Melchiſedech, Iethro, the thrée
Wiſemen, & all, as manie as trulie beléeued in the Meſſias.
Otherſome were Gentiles, both in the fleſh & in the
ſpirit: namelie they, who by the outward badge in their
fleſh, declared ye vncircumciſion & vncleanes of their hart.
                  Furthermore, where he addeth, (Yee were without
Chriſt, ye were aliants from the Commonwealth of Iſrael,
and ye were ſtrangers from the couenants of promiſe)
theſe words are ment, & muſt be vnderſtood by compariſon.
For the Gentiles, in reſpect of the people of Iſrael, &
ye certein time, are ſaid to be without Chriſt. Now, in ſaieng
(They were without Chriſt,) he meaneth that they
had not ſuch cléere knowledge of Chriſt as the Iews had.
(And aliants from the Commonwealth of Iſrael,) that
is to ſaie, (Straungers from the couenants of promiſe:) by
theſe words he noteth, that the Iſraelites had their Commonwealth
diuided & parted from the Gentiles, as one
houſhold is ſet aſunder from an other. For the Iewes
had their couenants, their ordinances, and ſeruice of God:
their promiſes, their kingdome, and their Prieſthood, &c.
of which S. Paule ſpeaketh to the Romans. Of this difference
in like maner,Rom. 9. 4. the Pſalme maketh mention, ſaieng:Pſal. 147. 19. 20.
                     Qui annunciat, &c. He ſheweth his word vnto Iacob,
his ſtatutes and his iudgements vnto Iſrael. Hee
hath not dealt ſo with euerie nation, neither haue they
knowne his iudgementes.
                  
                  The words which folowe, (And had no hope, & were
without God in the world,) are concluded vpon ye words
which went before. For whoſoeuer is without Chriſt,
how is it poſſible he ſhould haue hope. Whoſoeuer is
without Chriſt, he indéed is without God: for all that abide
not in ye doctrine of Chriſt, haue not God. Contrariwiſe,2. Iohn. 9.
he alone is ſaid to haue God, he (I ſaie) yt is in Chriſt
by faith. Herto ſerueth the ſaieng of S. Iohn, Omnis qui,



&c. Whoſoeuer trangreſſeth, & abideth not in the doctrine
of Chriſt, hath not God. Hee that continueth in
the doctrine of Chriſt, hee hath both the Father and
the Sonne.
                  
                  The compariſon which followeth, (Yee which once
were farre off, are made neere by the bloud of Chriſt,)
doth ſignifie the Epheſians, which were before out of the
Church, but now, through grace, receiued and brought into
the Church▪ and reconciled vnto God by the bloud of
Ieſus Chriſt. All theſe things tend herevnto, as I haue
ſaid alreadie, that we remembring ſo great a benefit of
heauenlie grace, ſhould walke in the feare of God: being
mindfull, that this our ſtate requireth new maners, and
a new life: to wit,Tit. 2. 12. 13. 14. 
                     That we ſhould liue holilie, and honeſtlie,
godlie, and vnblameablie in this world, looking
for that bleſſed hope, and comming of the glorie of the
great God, and our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who gaue himſelfe
for vs, to redeeme vs from iniquitie, & to cleanſe vs
a peculiar people vnto himſelfe, and followers of good
workes.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 14. 15. &. 16.
                  
                  
                     14 For he is our peace, which
hath made of both, one: & hath
broken the ſtop of the partition
vvall,
                     15 In abrogating, through his
fleſh, the hatred, that is, the lavv
of commandemēts, vvhich ſtandeth
in ordinances, for to make
of tvvaine, one nevve man in
himſelfe, ſo making peace,
                     16 And that he might reconcile
both vnto God, in one bodie, by
his croſſe, & ſtaie hatred therby.
                  
                  For hee is our peace, which
hath made both one, breaking
downe the wall that was a
ſtoppe betweene vs, and putting
awaie through his fleſh the
lawe of commaundements, contained
in the lawe written, that
of twaine hee might make one
newe man in himſelfe, ſo making
peace, and might reconcile
both in one bodie, by
his croſſe, ſtaieng hatred thereby.
                  IT is ſaid, that the Gentiles, which were ſometimes
out of Gods houſholde, are nowe taken in,
and made of the number, by Chriſts bloud. Nowe,
there is added a notable figure of Rhetorike, called



                     Expolitio, wherby that is expounded more at large,
which was ſaid before brieflie & in ſum. For the maner
of reconciliation or attonement betweene both people: to
wit, Iewes and Gentiles, is declared. And to begin withall,
Chriſt is made the foundation of this reconciliation or
attonement, when it is ſaid thus of the Apoſtle, (Hee is
our peace,) that is to ſaie, He is the Author of the reconciliation
or attonement, whereby of two people: namelie,
Iewes & Gentils, there is made one: that is, one Church,
which is the peculiar houſhold of God. After this is ſhewed
the manner of reconciliation, firſt in a ſimilitude: then
in plaine and euident words.
                  The ſimilitude is this, (The ſtop of the partition wall)
that is to ſaie, the hedge put betwéene them is cut downe
and laid waſt. The ſimilitude muſt be expounded in this
ſort. As he that is minded of two houſholds to make but
one, pulleth downe the wall which was betwéene them,
and made them two ſundrie houſholds, whereby they are
now made but one: ſo God, minding to make one people,
one Church, or one houſhold of the Iewes & the Gentiles,
tooke awaie (The partition wall) which ſet them aſunder.
Now what this (Partition wall) betwéene ye Iews
and the Gentiles was, he ſheweth in theſe plaine words,
(The hatred, that is, the lawe of commandements which
ſtandeth in ordinances.) Here, by the figure Metonymia,
he calleth (Hatred) the cauſe of the ſeparation betwéene
the Iewes and the Gentiles, which cauſe he maketh to
be (The law of commandements which ſtandeth in ordinaunces.)
Now, when he maketh this cauſe to be the
lawe, he meaneth not the morall lawe, which is perpetuall:
but the ceremoniall lawe onelie, which was a ſhadowe
of things to come. And this is that which the Apoſtle
ſaith, (He hath taken awaye hatred, euen the
lawe of commandements, which ſtandeth in ordinaunces,)
that is, in rites and ceremonies: (Through his
fleſh,) that is, by offering vp his fleſh a ſacrifice. A ſigne



or token of this abrogation or taking awaie of the lawe,
was the renting of the temple in ſunder,Mat. 27. 5. when the Lord
gaue vp the ghoſt vpon the altar of the croſſe. He addeth
alſo the end of this abrogation or aboliſhment,Mark. 15. 38. ſaieng: (To
make of twaine,
                     Luke. 23. 45. 
                     one new man in himſelfe.) By the figure
Metonymia, he caleth two nations of people, as it were diuerſe
houſholds, by the name of (two men.) He calleth the
Church of God one man, which is as it were one houſhold:
yea rather, one man, whoſe head is Chriſt: he calleth
this man, (the new man:) hauing an eie to the faſhion
& cuſtome of the world, which vſeth to call them (new
men) that being but baſe borne, or comming but of meane
ſtocke and parentage, become noble and honourable. For
we being the ofſpring of Adam, our forlorne father, are
made (new men,) and adopted into the ſonnes of God,
whiles we faſten our faith vpon Chriſt: ſo that we are
no longer called the children of Adam, but the children
of God. He rehearſeth this ende yet more plainlie, ſaieng,
(That he might reconcile both vnto God in one bodie,
by his croſſe,) that is: by the oblation which he
made vpon the croſſe. For vnder this word (Croſſe) is
meant the manner of making the oblation, whereby a
double reconciliation or attonement was made: the one,
of men with God: the other, of men with men: namelie,
of the Iewes and Gentiles betwéene themſelues.
                  Thus farre concerning the meaning of Saint Paules
words, now let vs marke the ſpecialties, which this place
doth offer and affoord.
                  The firſt is, that betwéene the Iewes and the Gentils
there is no difference, in reſpect of the communion
and partaking of grace. Wherefore let none be proud,
becauſe he is a Iew: and let none deſpaire, becauſe he is
a Gentile. For one nation hath no more prerogatiue or
excellence than another,Actes. 10. 34. 35. before God. God is no regarder
of perſons: but in all people, he that feareth him is accepted
before him: and he that worketh righteouſneſſe



is eſteemed. Grace is common vnto all, and it is offered
to euerie one.
                  The ſecond is, That the lawe of Moſes is abrogated
and put downe, (I meane for outward rites and ceremonies:)
inſomuch, that none ſtands compellable to receiue
it: yea, whoſoeuer receiueth it, denieth Chriſt, and deſpiſeth
the vertue of Chriſts croſſe.
                  The third is, That the death of Chriſt is the reconciliation
& attonement of man with God: wherin we are
borne (new men) & ingraffed into Chriſts bodie, as members
of the ſame. The fourth is, That without the croſſe
of Chriſt, we can, by no meanes, be at peace with God.
                  The fift is, That as in Chriſt we haue peace with
God: ſo it is méete, that in him alſo we labour to be at
peace and vnitie one with another: which (doubtleſſe) can
neuer be, vnleſſe we be lead by Chriſts ſpirit, and haue
faith in him. For by faith we are ingraffed into his bodie,
that all of vs, as manie as beléeue in Chriſt, maie be
made the members of Chriſt. Wherfore it is reaſon and
dutie, that one of vs ſhould make much of another, as
members of one and the ſelfe ſame bodie.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 17. & 18.
                  
                  
                     17 And came and preached
peace vnto you, vvhich vvere a
farre off, & to them that were
neere.
                     18 For through him, vve both
haue an entrance vnto the Father
by one ſpirit.
                  
                  And comming, he preached
peace vnto you, which were far
off, & to them that were nigh.
Becauſe through him we both
haue an open waie in one ſpirit
vnto the Father.
                  THe matter of reconciliation or attonement betwéene
the Iewes and the Gentiles being expounded, the Apoſtle
commeth to the inſtrumentall cauſe thereof, which
is, The preaching of the Goſpell. For it is Gods pleaſure,
that his Goſpell ſhould not onelie be an inſtrument of
ſaluation, but alſo a witneſſe and warrant of his good
will. Wherevpon it commeth to paſſe, that the Goſpell
is vnto vs, a moſt aſſured and certeine meſſenger, and tidings
bringer of peace, betwéene God and vs. For which



cauſe the Goſpell is named,2. Co. 5. 19 
                     Sermo reconciliationis, The
word of reconciliation. The diuiſion following, where
Chriſt is ſaid to haue come, and to haue preached to them
(which were a farre off, and to them which were neere:)
that is to ſaie, to the Iewes, and to the Gentiles, noteth
vnto vs, that Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles to preach the Goſpell
of peace vnto all people, one with an other, none excepted:Mark. 16. 15.
according to that ſaieng: Ite in mundum, &c.
Goe ye throughout all the world, and preach the Goſpell
vnto euerie creature. The fruite of their peace made
with God is alſo added, which is, that both of them: to
wit, the Iewes and the Gentiles, (Haue entraunce vnto
the Father, by Chriſt, and that in one ſpirit:) that is to
ſaie, by the ſelfe ſame ſpirit of Chriſt, which maketh vs
crie,Rom. 8. 15 
                     Abba Father. Chriſt therefore is as it were a doore
vnto vs,Gal. 4. 6. whereby we come to the Father, being reconciled
and ſet at one with vs, in faith and beliefe. Now the
holie ſpirit is our guide, by whom we being ioined and vnited
in Chriſt, comming to the doore, are let in, and haue
entrance to the father. Hereto ſerueth that ſaieng of Iohn,
Amen,
                     Ioh. 10. 1. &. 7. 
                     Amen dico vobis, &c. Verelie Verelie I ſaie vnto
you, he that entreth not in by the doore into the ſheepfold,
but climeth vp another waie, he is a theefe, and a
robber. And a little after, Ego ſum ianua ouium, I am the
doore of the ſheepe. Furthermore, here are two places to
be marked: the one is, what accompt we ought to make
of the miniſters of the Goſpell, who when they preach
to vs the goſpell, Chriſt himſelfe is ſaid to preach vnto vs.
Wherfore we ought no leſſe to regard their voice, than if
we heard Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaking vnto vs. Herto ſerueth
that ſaieng of Saint Paule,
                     2. Co. 19. 20. 
                     Nomine, &c. Now then are
we ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though he did beſeech you
through vs, we praie you in Chriſts ſtead, that ye be reconciled
to God. The other place is, of the fruit of ye goſpell:
namelie, that ſuch as beléeue ye goſpel, are reconciled
vnto God through Chriſt, by whom they haue entraunce



vnto God. The Apoſtle ſaith, Iuſtificati, &c. Being iuſtified
by faith,
                     Rom. 5. 1. 2 
                     we haue peace towards God, through our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whom alſo we haue entraunce, &c.
Contrariwiſe, who ſo hath not Chriſt, that is, beléeueth
not in Chriſt, he is void of the fruite of the Goſpell: and
therefore is to be thought and taken for a wicked perſon,
and an enimie to God.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 19. &. 20.
                  
                  
                     19 Novv therefore, ye are no
more ſtraungers and forreigners,
but Citizens vvith the
Saints, and of the houſhold of
God,
                     20 And are built vpon the
foundation of the Apoſtles &
Prophets, Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe
being the chiefe corner ſtone.
                  
                  Now therefore, ye are no more
ſtraungers and forreigners, but
fellowe citizens of the Saints, and
of Gods houſhold, being builded
vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles
and Prophets, the chiefe corner
ſtone whereof is Ieſus Chriſt
himſelfe.
                  THis is a generall concluſion of the whole Chapter,
wherin he reckoneth vp the principall points. For,
firſt he ſheweth what manner of people the Epheſians
were, before the grace of regeneration or new birth, & by
them all other Gentiles, likewiſe. Secondlie, he declareth
what they haue gotten by grace. Indéede they were aliants
& ſtrangers before, that is, out of Gods houſhold, as
we haue ſhewed alredie. But now being made frée of the
Citie, common to all the Saints, they are receiued into
Gods houſhold: becauſe (They are built vpon the foundation
of the Apoſtles and Prophets,) that is to ſaie, becauſe
they are receiued into fauour and grace by faith,
which is their leaning ſtaffe, to reſt themſelues by, vpon
Chriſt their onelie foundation. For no man can laie anie
other foundation,
                     1. Co. 3. 11 
                     beſides that which is alreadie laid,
which is Ieſus Chriſt.
                  
                  Now, Ieſus Chriſt is called (The foundation,) both
becauſe the promiſe of ſaluation was made in him, and



alſo, becauſe Chriſt alone is the ſaluation of the Church,
vpon whom ſhe ſtaieth her ſelfe. For, without Chriſt, the
whole building of the Church ſhrinketh and falleth flat
to the ground: yea, without him, it cannot be ſo much as
once begun. He is alſo called (The foundation of the Apoſtles
and Prophets,) not onelie becauſe the Apoſtles
being built vpon that foundation obteined ſaluation: but
alſo, and that much more in reſpect of the Church. For,
the Apoſtles did build the Church vpon this foundation.
                  Moreouer, when the Apoſtle addeth, (Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe
being the chiefe corner ſtone,) he teacheth vs, by
what power & vertue, the building of the Church, conſiſting
of two diuerſe people, Iewes & Gentiles, continueth:
namelie, becauſe (Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe is the chiefe corner
ſtone.) For, as the corner ſtone ioineth walles together,
and beareth vp the whole burthen of the building:
yea, preſerueth it: euen ſo our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by the
doctrine of faith, and by the efficacie and forceable working
of his ſpirit, knitteth the Iewes and the Gentiles, in
vnitie of faith and peace: and ſo he himſelfe vpholdeth
and mainteineth this ſpirituall building.
                  
                     This ſimilitude is borowed of the Prophet Eſaie, whoſe
words lie thus in order, Ecce, ego ponam in Syon lapidem,Eſaie. 28. 16.
&c. Behold; I will late in Syon a ſtone, a tried ſtone,
a precious corner ſtone, a ſ
                        ••
                     e foundation: He that beleeueth,
ſhall not make haſt: namelie, to his owne counſelles,
but ſhall attend and wait for the counſell and purpoſe
of God, which if he doe, he ſhall not be put to ſhame.
The ſelfe ſame ſaieng of the Prophet, Saint Peter reherſeth,
the ſenſe reſerued, but the words a little chaunged.
For thus ſaith he: Ecce, ponam, &c. Behold, I will put
in Syon a chiefe corner ſtone,1. Pet. 2. 6. elect and precious, and he
that beleeueth therein, ſhall not be aſhamed. Of this
ſtone, mention is alſo made in the Pſalme: Lapidem
quem,Pſal. 11. 8 22. &c. The ſtone which the builders refuſed, is the
head of the corner.
                  
                     
Beſide that which is ſaid, we haue to gather out of
Saint Paules words, theſe ſpecialties following.
                  The firſt is, That of Iewes and Gentiles there is
one Church of Chriſt made and ioined together, as we
haue ſhewed alreadie.
                  The ſecond is, That Chriſt alone is the foundation of
the Church.
                  The third is, That whoſoeuer is without Chriſt, he
alſo is without the Church.
                  The fourth is, That the doctrine of the Apoſtles and
Prophets alone, ought to haue authoritie in the Church
of God, and is the onelie badge and cogniſance of the true
Church.
                  The fift is, That Chriſt alone vpholdeth, kéepeth, and
mainteineth the Church.
                  The ſixt is, That the Church is not without miniſterie,
which preacheth vnto vs the ſame corner ſtone which
Saint Paule commendeth vnto vs heere.
                  Theſe ſpecialties ouerthrowe manie errours of the
Papiſts: and chiefelie of them, which will haue vs truſt
and betake our ſelues to mens merits and ſafegards: and
which alſo, in the place of the Prophets and Apoſtles
doctrine, plant mens traditions and forgeries. Let Poperie
therefore be vnto all the godlie, a thing moſt accurſed:
which it behoueth all true Chriſtians to auoid and
flie from, leaſt they themſelues be ill fauouredlie defiled
therewith, and being defiled, be alſo caſt off againe, and
forſaken of God.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 21. &. 22.
                  
                  
                     21 In vvhom all the building
coupled together, grovveth
vnto an holie Temple in the
Lord,
                     22 In vvhom ye alſo are built
together, to be the habitation
of God, by the ſpirit.
                  
                  In whom the whole building
(or frame) coupled together
accordinglie, groweth vnto an
holie Temple in the Lord, in
whom alſo ye are built together
to be Gods dwelling in the ſpirit.
                  THe Apoſtle enlargeth his concluſion, by a tranſlation,
or turning of the ſpecialties into a generalitie, & by an



exhortation. He ſaid that the Epheſians were built vpon
the foundation of the Apoſtles & Prophets: now he applieth
this to all the faithfull in generall. For, he ſaith, that
(The whole building,) that is, the whole Catholike
Church, and all the members thereof, being builded vpon
this one corner ſtone, (Groweth into an holie temple:)
that is to ſaie, that the whole building is made one holie
temple, & that in the Lord, as the onelie foundation of the
temple. Now, S. Paule in this place vſeth a verie full,
ſignificant, and pithie word: namelie, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     :
that is (coupled together) wherby is ment, that ye building
of the Church is ſo knit and couched together, ſo framed,
I ſaie, and wrought, that all and euerie part thereof is
fitted and faſtened, in ſuch méete proportion, euen meaſure,
and apt agréement, with ſuch ſound & ſtrong ioints,
that they hang one by an other verie orderly, as the members
and lims of the bodie. Now, this knitting or conpling
of the ioints is done in this manner. Firſt, all the
faithfull cleaue vnto Chriſt their head by faith, and vpon
him, as their onelie foundation, ſtate themſelues. Then
they cleaue together among themſelues, one wt another,
according to the meaſure of faith in euerie one of them,
and according to the diuerſitie of gifts, which God hath
giuen them: that they might all make one bodie, & one
holie temple of God, of which temple, all the faithfull are
liuelie ſtones, in ſuch excéeding comelie order and agréement
knit together, & wrought in one, that there is not a
corporation or companie of men to be found in all the
world, linked in like loue, concord, and vnitie among
themſelues. Furthermore, when we heare either the
whole Church, or the ſeuerall members thereof, called
(The holie temple of God,) let vs thus ſuppoſe
with our ſelues: Firſt, That the Church is Gods
building. Secondlie, That God dwelleth, in this temple,
which is appointed and ordeined for his glorie. Thirdlie,
That as it is a fowle and hainous offenſe▪ to defile this



temple with anie vncleanneſſe, ſo it becommeth all the
gooue, to bend their endeuours euerie waie, that they
maie lead their life in holineſſe & vnblameableneſſe, leaſt
through their default it come to paſſe, that the Maiſter
builder caſt them out, and throwe them awaie, as rotten
and mooldering ſtones ſeruing to no good vſe. I would to
God this could ſinke into their hearts, which either with
their owne priuate lewd dealings blemiſh the Church: or
with their vnprofitable quarelings, cut in péeces the vnion
or agréement of the Church.
                  Heere the reaſon muſt be marked, why the whole
Church of God is called (One temple:) and why euerie
ſeuerall beleeuer, is named (The liuelie temple of
God) in like caſe. The whole Church is therefore called
the temple of God, both becauſe it is reared vp and
built vpon one foundation: and alſo becauſe all the faithfull
being ioined together in the vnitie of faith and loue,
haue God dwelling in them, whom they ſerue and worſhip.
Euerie ſeuerall Chriſtian is therefore called the
liuelie temple of God, both for that euerie of them is builded
vpon one onelie foundation, which is the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt: and alſo, for that God dwelleth in euerie of them,
whoſe mightineſſe is to be praiſed and magnified of all
generallie, and alſo of euerie one particularlie.
                  The exhortation of the Apoſtle doth folowe. (In whom
(ſaith he) ye alſo are built together to be the habitation
of God, by the ſpirit.) (In whom.) to wit, the corner
ſtone, (ye alſo are built together:) namelie, by the faith
of Chriſt, and loue among your ſelues one with another,
renouncing and forſaking all vnholineſſe, heatheniſhneſſe,
and vncleanneſſe. After this manner the Apoſtle ſpeaketh
elſewhere, in an exhortation, drawing his argument
or proofe from the dignitie or worthineſſe of Gods temple.1. Co. 6. 9
For theſe are his words, Ah: Non ſcitis, &c. Ah:
Know ye not, that your bodie is the temple of the holie
Ghoſt, which is in you, whom ye haue of God?
                  
               
            
         
         
            
            ¶THE THIRD CHAPTER.
            
               ¶THE SVMME OF THE
third Chapter.
               I Paule a Priſoner of Ieſus Chriſt, beare ambaſſage
for your behoofe, O ye Gentiles, to open
and make knowne vnto you the myſterie of ſaluation.
Wherefore I requeſt you to continue conſtant and ſtedfaſt
in the doctrine which ye haue receiued: whereto, that
the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, would vouchſafe to
giue you ſtrength, I bow my knees, to whom be glorie
for euermore.
            
            
               THE ORDER AND PARTES OF
the third Chapter.
               OF this Chapter there are foure partes. The firſt is,
a comfirmation of the calling of the Gentiles, wherof
he reaſoned in the laſt Chapter: which confirmation
is taken from Saint Paules Apoſtleſhip, or from the end
whereto it was ordeined: the ſumme of it is this. God
hath made and appointed me Paule an Apoſtle of the
Gentiles: therefore belongeth the Goſpell to the Gentiles
in déede. This part hath his amplifications or enlargements,
whereby both the Goſpell is aduanced, and
Saint Paules Apoſtleſhip alſo commended.
               The ſeconde part ſtandeth vpon an exhortation to
conſtancie and perſeueraunce, which is the ende of his
whole writing: as I gaue you to note euen nowe, in
the declaration of the Argument or ſumme of the Epiſtle.
               The third part is a ſignification of Saint Paules praier
for the Epheſians, that it would pleaſe God to giue
them ſtrength and perfect knowledge of Chriſt.
               The fourth is a thankeſgiuing. The firſt of theſe



partes is didaſcalicall, that is, ſeruing for doctrine, from
the which the reſt haue their iſſue, wherein the doctrine
is applied to the Epheſians.
               
            
            
               ¶THE EXPOSITION OF THE THIRD
Chapter, with the obſeruation of doctrines
therein contained.
               
                  
                     Verſe. 1.
                  
                  1 For this cauſe, I Paule am the
priſoner of Ieſus Chriſt, for
you Gentiles.
                  For this things ſake, I Paule am
that ſame priſoner (or captiue) of
Ieſus Chriſt for you Gentiles.
                  
                     THis is the firſt part of the Chapter: to
wit, a confirmation of the calling of the
Gentiles. The meaning of the wordes is
this. Mine Apoſtleſhippe which I beare
among the Gentiles, and for the which
I am now kept priſoner, is a proofe ſufficient,
that the Goſpell pertaineth to the Gentiles. (The
priſoner or captiue of Chriſt,) is paſſiuelie taken, and
betokeneth to ſuffer. For Saint Paule was taken and
kept priſoner for the glorie of Chriſt, ſhewed vnto the
Gentiles. I haue added the particle (Sum, Am,)
as Eraſmus doth, to make the ſentence fall perfect and
ful, that (Priſoner) might be the Predicatum, which therfore
hath verie well his Article ioined with him, bicauſe
it is taken figuratiuelie, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      for excellencie ſake,
as in that of S. Iohn, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , I am not
that ſame light. And againe, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
I am that good ſhepheard. So héere alſo, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
I am that ſame priſoner of Ieſus Chriſt, who haue
the name euerie where to bee him, that would make
the Gentiles equall with the Iewes: for which things
ſake, I am now lead awaie to Rome, and there kept priſoner.
Héere thrée places offer themſelues vnto vs. The
firſt, That the preaching of the Goſpell is ordeined for the



building vp of the Church. The ſeconde, That the godlie
preachers of the word, muſt looke for nothing but
trouble and perſecution at the hands of the world. The
third, That the preaching of the Goſpell is a moſt aſſured
token and vndoubted warrant of Gods fauour.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 2. 3. &. 4.
                  
                  
                     2 If ye haue heard of the diſpenſation
of the grace of God,
vvhich is giuen mee to you
vvard,
                     3 That is, that God by reuelation
hath ſhevved this myſterie
vnto me, as I vvrote aboue in
fevv vvords:
                     4 Whereby, vvhen ye read, ye
maie knovve mine vnderſtanding
in the myſterie of Chriſt.
                  
                  If ye haue heard of the diſpenſation,
(or miniſtration) of
the grace of God, which is giuen
me to you ward, to wit,
that God by reuelation hath
made the Goſpell knowne vnto
me, (as I wrote vnto you before,
whereby, when yee read
ye may vnderſtand my knowledge
in the myſterie of Chriſt.
                  THis is a cauſe of the former reaſon, taken from the
cauſe efficient, which (he ſaith) was not vnknowne to
the Epheſians. Firſt he ſheweth, he was called of God
to the office of an Apoſtle. Secondlie, he declareth ye manner
of his calling. Thirdlie, he auoucheth that he learned
the Goſpell from aboue, euen of God, concerning which
thing he wrote to the Epheſians before, as he ſaith, to the
intent that they in reading, might vnderſtand & knowe
the certeintie of his doctrine and calling.Acts. 9. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. &c. All theſe points
pertaine to this purpoſe, that we may be aſſured, that S.
Paule was an Apoſtle of the Gentiles, by the appointment
and commaundement of God,Acts. 22. 4 5. 6. 7. &c. ſo that wée neede not
at anie hand to doubt of the certeintie of his vocation or
calling:Acts. 26. 12 13. 14. 15. &c. teſtimonies whereof may bée read in the Actes
of the Apoſtles, in his Epiſtles to the Galathians, and the
Philippians.

                  Héere thrée things méet vs worthie of marking.Phil. 3. 4. 5 &c. Firſt,
How neceſſarie the certeintie of their calling is, which



teach in the Church. The ſecond, That the Goſpell is a
myſterie vnknowne to mans reaſon: flat againſt that
moſt filthie and beaſtlie knaue, which braggeth without
ſhame, that he (forſooth) by naturall reaſon found out
the neceſſitie of the Goſpell, and the ſending of the Meſſias
into the world, without the writings of the Prophets
and Apoſtles. The third, That the certeintie of the Apoſtles
doctrine is vnmoueable, ſtedfaſt, and vndeceiuable.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 5. & 6.
                  
                  
                     5 Which in other ages vvas
not opened vnto the ſonnes of
men, as it is novv reuealed vnto
his Apoſtles and Prophets,
by the ſpirit,
                     6 That the Gentiles ſhould be
inheritours alſo, & of the ſame
bodie, and partakers of his promiſe
in Chriſt, by the Goſpell.
                  
                  VVhich in other ages (or
times) was not knowne to the
ſonnes of men, as it is now opened
vnto the holie Apoſtles
and Prophets, by the ſpirit,
that the Gentiles are coheires
and of the ſame bodie, and
partakers of his promiſe in
Chriſt, by the Goſpell.
                  THis is an amplification or enlargment by compariſon,
wherein a reaſon is rendered, why the Goſpell
of the calling of the Gentiles is named (A Myſterie:) to
wit, bicauſe it was vnknown to the world, till ſuch time
as it was opened by heauenlie reuelation: that it was
not made manifeſt to all the Gentiles indifferentlie, one
with an other: that the knowledge of this myſterie was
not ſo euident to the olde Prophets, as it was to the Apoſtles.
For, although the olde Prophets propheſied
much of the calling of the Gentiles to the Goſpell: yet
notwithſtanding, the time and the manner thereof were
not ſo cléere to them, as to the Apoſtles, Nowe, what
kinde of myſterie this is of the Goſpell, which hee hath
in hand, he declareth, in ſaieng, (That the Gentiles
ſhould be inheritours alſo, and of the ſame bodie, and
partakers of his promiſe, in Chriſt, by the Goſpell.) The



myſterie of the Goſpell therfore is this, That the Iewes
and the Gentiles are made ioint-heires of the heauenlie
inheritaunce, that they all make one bodie in Chriſt, and
that the promiſe of grace, which is offered by the Goſpell,
pertaineth vnto them both alike. This equalitie, or
making of the Iewes and Gentils all alike, ouerthroweth
the prerogatiue or title of excellencie, whereof the
Iewes maie ſéeme to vaunt. For, ſaluation is a méere
frée gift, which is alſo offered fréelie to the moſt vnworthie
Gentiles, and to Idolaters, but is receiued by faith
alone. For when the Apoſtle ſaith, (Of his promiſe in
Chriſt,) and when he maketh the Iewes and the Gentiles
euen and equall: what elſe doth he, but exclude and
harre out all degrées of worthineſſe in merites, and requireth
the faith of the promiſe? The ſpecialties of this
place followe in order.
                  The
                        •
                      firſt, That the Goſpell is a myſterie, which
mans reaſon cannot of it ſelfe, by anie meanes, reach
vnto.
                  The ſecond, That the myſterie of the Goſpell is reueled
by the holie Ghoſt, in preaching with liuelie voice,
and ſounding vtterance. For outward preaching auaileth
and profiteth little, vnleſſe there be preſent within
vs, the true teacher: namelie, the holie Ghoſt, which
is effectuall and forceable in the worde, and with the
word.
                  The third, That all Chriſts faithfull ones, are heires
of one and the ſelfe ſame inheritaunce, members of one
and the ſelfe ſame bodie, and partakers of one and the
ſelfe ſame ſaluation, by one and the ſelfe ſame Ieſus
Chriſt.
                  The fourth, That the dignitie of the miniſtrie of the
Goſpell is excéeding great, and the neceſſitie thereof is
not ſmal. For, by the ſame, the promiſe of ſaluation, which
is to be receiued by faith alone, is offered vnto all in
Chriſt Ieſus.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Verſe. 7.
                  
                  7 Whereof I am made a
miniſter, by the gift of the
grace of God, giuen vnto
me, through the vvorking
of his povver.
                  VVhereof I am made a miniſter,
according to the gift of
Gods grace, giuen vnto me, according
to the working of his
power.
                  SAint Paule méeteth them in the téeth, which would
charge him with arrogancie, for that he doth ſo highlie
aduance his miniſterie, & he vſeth a certaine ſhifting
off from himſelfe to an other. For, he doth not make his
owne merit or vertue, but Gods grace, the cauſe that hée
was called to be an Apoſtle. Againe, he aſcribeth it to the
working of Gods power, that by his Apoſtleſhip, it pleaſed
God to build his Church. For ſéeing God is able to
bring to paſſe, that things which are not, maie bée: why
then might he not of a bloudſucker make a
                        ••
                      Apoſtle? why
then might he not of an arrogant perſon, make a wiſe
preacher? why then might he not of a weakling, make a
Champion? Let euerie one of vs ſet before his eies this
example of S. Paule, & if we couet & deſire to ſéeme anie
thing in ye houſe of God, let vs confeſſe, that it is the gift of
God: if anie of vs haue ſome place of dignitie & account
in the Church, let him acknowlege that it was the working
of Gods power: if anie thing that is ſingular & excellent
proceede from him, let him caſt awaie all vaine
arrogancie & bragging, let him abaſe himſelf before God,
let him knowe that greater gifts are giuen him, that he
might be more bound to ſerue others, & not to take vpon
him the office of a Controller, to reproue & finde fault
with others: but let him honour & reuerence euerie one,
according as his place and degrée ſhall require.
                  
                     Athanaſius noteth vpon this place,Three things neceſſarie in the Miniſters of Gods vvord. that in the miniſters
of Gods word, three things are neceſſarie. The firſt,
a ſtoute and valiant heart that will not ſhrinke in anie
daunger: as heere S. Paule writeth and preacheth Chriſt
boldlie, and with a courage, euen in bonds and impriſonment.
The ſecond, wiſdome and vnderſtanding, without



which he is not able to diſcharge this hard & buiſie
office. The third, an vpright life, holie, and honeſt. For
it is the dutie of a ſhepheard to goe before his flock, no
leſſe in life than in voice: and as well in deed, as in word.
When theſe thrée things ſhine in the miniſters of God,
their labour cannot be without plentifull fruit. Contrariwiſe,
when the hearts of the miniſters are ſtriken dead
with the feare of Tyrants, when they are diſcouraged,
when the foundations of their doctrine are not faithfullie
laid, when their life is not anſwerable to the worthineſſe
of their calling, then the church of God is in a miſerable
taking. For what ſhall become of the ſhéep, when either
the ſhepheard is deuoured of the woolfe, or elſe vnarmed
fléeth from the woolfe, leauing his ſhéep at hap hazard?

Saints is this grace giuen, that I
ſhould preach among the Gentiles,
the vnſearchable riches of
Chriſt,
                     9 And to make cleere vnto all
men, vvhat the fellowſhip of
the myſterie is, vvhich from the
beginning of the vvorld hath
bene hid in God, vvho hath created
all things by Ieſus Chriſt,
                     10 To the intent that novv,
vnto principalities and powers
in heauenlie places, might bee
knovvne, by the Church, the
manifold vviſedome of God,
                     11 According to the eternall
purpoſe, vvhich he vvrought in
Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.
                  
                  Vnto me the leaſt of all Saints
this grace is giuen, euen to
preach among the Gentiles, the
vnſearchable riches of Chriſt,
and to make euident vnto all
men, what the followſhippe (or
communion) of this myſterie is,
which hath bene hidden from
beginnings in God, who made
all things through Chriſt, that
now might bee knowne vnto
rules and powers in heauenlie
places, by the Church (or congregation,)
the manifold wiſedome
of God, according to the
eternall purpoſe, which hee
purpoſed (or decreed) in our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                  THat which the Apoſtle had brieflie touched, he diſcourſeth
vpon more at large: namelie, that he was
called of God to be an Apoſtle of the Gentiles. And this
is the ſum of this long period or point. But, that we maie
gather greater fruite thereout, I will ſeuerallie intreat
vpon euerie part of this amplification or enlargement,



and make the ſame ſerue to our vſe
                  Firſt therefore when he ſaith, (Vnto me the leaſt of
all Saints, is this grace giuen,) he doth not abaſe his office,
but acknowledgeth the condition of his own perſon:
and that for this purpoſe, that the greatneſſe of: Gods
grace towards him might the more excell. What learne
we by this? Euen to magnifie & aduance our office, whervnto
we are called, with thankſgiuing, and to take nothing
vnto our ſelues arrogantlie. If therefore we do anie
thing aright, let vs aſcribe the ſame wholie vnto Gods
grace, not to our ſelues, who without the grace of God
are vtterlie vnprofitable inſtruments. Let the godlie
ſhepheard therefore not ſuffer his office to bée deſpiſed, although
he acknowledge himſelfe vnable and vnfit for ſo
great a calling. Againe, let him not ſette light by other
his fellow-labourers, as his vnderlings, and himſelfe
their better: but let him confeſſe that they all (as
well as hée) are ſtewardes of the myſteries of God.
                  Secondlie, when the Apoſtle addeth, (That I ſhould
preach among the Gentiles the vnſearchable riches of
Chriſt,) hée ſheweth the ende of his Apoſtleſhippe. For
he ſaith, he was made an Apoſtle. Whie? Not that vnder
this title hée ſhould boaſt in idlneſſe: but (That hee
ſhould preach the vnſearchable riches of Chriſt,)
which (as Saint Ambroſe ſaith) hée vouchſafed to
beſtowe vpon the Gentiles, a people paſt hope, that
without workes they might bée ſaued, euen through
faith.
                  Nowe, he calleth them (Vnſearchable riches of
Chriſt,) not onelie bicauſe the ſearching of them out is
beyond the reach of reaſon: but alſo bicauſe they cannot
be found out at the full in this world: no, not of the faithfull:
but a taſt onelie giuen vnto them, which is inough
for the hope of ſaluation. By this ſpeach therfore of the Apoſtle,
not onlie their arrogancie is rebuked, which thinke
that they haue in their heads, whatſoeuer is conteined in



Gods holie word: but there is alſo commended vnto vs
a ſingular and ſpeciall diligence, that we ſhould trauell
(tooth and naile) all that we maie, to profit continuallie
in the ſchoole of Chriſt: ralling vpon the holie ſpirit our
teacher, without whoſe aſſiſtaunce and aide, our labour
is vtterlie loſt, in ſeeking to obteine this ſpirituall wiſedome.
Againe, they are alſo put to ſilence, & daſht, which
vainlie cogge and lie, that they are Saint Paules ſucceſſors:
albeit they preach not with Saint Paule, (The vnſearchable
riches of Chriſt,) touching remiſſion of ſinnes
fréelie giuen: but either liue like idle and lazie lubbers:
or elſe bring a doctrine, which is at defiance and daggers
drawing with the Goſpell of Chriſt.
                  Thirdlie, when this is added, (And to make cleare
vnto all men, what the fellowſhip of the myſterie is,)
the Apoſtle expoundeth the clauſe going before. For that
which he called euen now (That vnſearchable riches of
Chriſt,) he expoundeth now a certeine fellowſhip & partaking
of the benefits of Chriſt, which the Goſpell offereth:
to wit, That the Iewes and the Gentiles are partakers
of the ſelfe ſame redemption in Chriſt. Herehence
let vs therefore learne, that all difference of people, perſon,
eſtate, and degrée, is taken awaie: for the kingdome
of Chriſt meddeleth with no ſuch matter:Ro. 10. 12 
                     For one and
the ſame Chriſt is rich inough vnto all that call vpon
him.
                  
                  Fourthlie, when it is thus ſaid, (Which from the
beginning of the world hath bene hidde in God, who
hath created all things by Ieſus Chriſt,) he cutteth off
their obiection, which deſpiſed the Goſpell, as a doctrine
but latelie hatcht: as manie alſo in the Apoſtles time
did. Héereby let vs take heart at graſſe againſt the enimies
of the Goſpell, which fowlie béelie vs; calling vs
brochers and builders of a certeine new and ſtraunge
doctrine. For, our cauſe is common with the holie Apoſtles
of God. Neither are theſe words added in waſte,



(Who hath created all things by Ieſus Chriſt.) For this
ſaieng is a teſtimonie and witneſſe of our new creation.
For it is méete and conuenient, that by him we ſhould
be newlie created, by whom we were firſt created. As
therefore God, in olde time, created the world by Ieſus
Chriſt: ſo is his good pleaſure, by the ſame Ieſus Chriſt,
to reſtore the world againe, and to create it anew. Out
of this place is likewiſe gathered, not onelie the eternitie
and euerlaſtingneſſe of the ſonne: (For if God by his
ſonne created all things, then ſurelie the ſonne himſelfe
was not created, becauſe he was before euerie creature,
and therefore God:) but alſo a vnitie of two natures: to
wit, of the Godhead, and the Manhood: being ſuch a vnitie,
that the properties of both, by reaſon of the vnitie of
the perſon, are communicated: and yet the properties vnconfounded.
Therefore Saint Paule ſaith héere verie
well, (That God made and created all things by Ieſus
Chriſt:) becauſe this Ieſus Chriſt is verie God.
                  And although it be rightlie ſaid, Ieſus the sonne of
Marie created all things: yet notwithſtanding, it is amiſſe
to ſaie, That the nature of Chriſts manhood created
all things. For the nature of Chriſts manhood is indeede
a creature, and not a creator. For the interchanging
of properties, whereby that which is proper to one,
is aſcribed and giuen to the other, for the communion of
them in the ſame perſon, is at no hand to be allowed or
graunted in names of nature, or (as the vſe is to ſpeake)
in the Abſtract: becauſe, neither thoſe things which
are proper to the Manhood, are to be aſcribed to the Godhead:
as, To be created, To ſuffer, To be temporall,
To be limitted, &c: neither are thoſe things which belong
onelie to the Godhead, in anie caſe to be attributed
to the Manhood: as, To be vncreated, Not to ſuffer, To
be eternall, To be vnlimitted, &c: but in the Concrete
either naturall, or perſonall, either expreſſing one nature,
or declaring both, this interchaungeable applieng



of properties maie well be, becauſe of the identitie or
ſelfeſameneſſe of the Hypoſtaſis or perſon, and a certeine
neceſſarie ſequeale or following: as, that thoſe
things which are proper vnto man, ſhould be aſcribed vnto
God,2. Cor. 28. and to the ſonne of God, as when it is ſaid, The
Lord of glorie was crucified:
                     Mat. 26. 2 to wit, The ſonne of man
was crucified: now, The Lord of glorie: and, The ſonne
of man, is all one: therefore the Lord of glorie was alſo
crucified: which is made manifeſt ſtreightwaie by a
Syllogiſme expoſitorie, or by a reaſon conſiſting in expoſition.
So God, in the latter daies became a little childe:
of whom the Prophet ſpeaketh in this manner,Eſaie. 9. 6. 
                     Puer
natus eſt nobis, &c. For vnto vs a childe is borne, and
vnto vs a ſonne is giuen: and the gouernment is vpon
his ſhoulder, and he ſhall call his name, Wonderfull,
Counſeller, The mightie God, The euerlaſting Father,
The Prince of peace, &c.
                  
                  Fiftlie, when he ſaith, (To the intent that now vnto
principalities, and powers in heauenlie places,) that
is, to Gods holie Angels, (might be knowne by the
Church, the manifold wiſedome of God,) farre aboue all
wiſedome of creatures, he extolleth the perfect knowledge
of Gods myſteries, touching the ſaluation of the Gentiles
by faith, that he might the more deteine and kéepe
the Epheſians in admiration and wondering at this myſterie.
For, why ſhould it not be wonderfull, that contrarie
things are made of contrarie things? For, by death,
life was recouered: by weakneſſe, power was obteined:
by ſhame, glorie was gotten: to be ſhort, by death and
the curſſe, life and ſaluation was giuen to them that were
dead and damned. And héereof it commeth, that the
Angels of Heauen are ſaid, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , euen to
ſtoope downe,1. Pet. 1. 12. as it were, and attentiuelie to behold
and liſten, what the Apoſtles doe preach. Howbeit,
this is not ſo to be taken, as though the Angels profited
by the preaching of the Church: but becauſe in the



Church aſſembled and gathered out of Iewes and Gentiles,
they behold, as in a glaſſe, this wiſedome of God,
and are aſconniſhed (as it were) at this ſtraunge ſpectacle,
that the Lord Chriſt vouchſafed the wicked & wretched
world ſo great glorie, that all beléeuers ſhould be
bleſſed, and liue with him euerlaſtinglie.
                  Sixtlie, when it is added (According to the eternall
purpoſe, which he wrought in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord,)
he calleth vs backe, both to the firſt cauſe of our ſaluation:
to wit, the eternall purpoſe of God, whereby he decréed
with himſelfe from euerlaſting, to ſaue mankinde:
and alſo to the matter of this ſaluation: namelie, Ieſus
Chriſt. But of theſe cauſes we haue ſpoken largelie
inough in the firſt Chapter.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 12.
                  
                  12 By vvhom vve haue boldneſſe
and entrance, vvith confidence,
by faith in him.
                  By whom we are bold to drawe
nigh, in that truſt which we haue
by faith in him.
                  THe Apoſtle ſetteth downe the ſumme of the benefits
of the myſterie reuealed: that is to ſaie, of the Goſpell:
and he addeth the manner or meane whereby men
receiue thoſe benefits. Now, the ſum of the benefits is,
that we haue peace with God, by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
For whoſoeuer is not afraid boldlie to come before God,
they are perſuaded out of doubt, that God is at one with
them, and fauourable vnto them: yea, they dare call vpon
him in all their neceſſities: to be ſhort, they looke for
all good and healthfull things at his hands. The meane
whereby we receiue theſe benefits, is expreſſed, when he
ſaith, (By faith in him,) that is to ſaie, by beléeuing in
him.
                  This place is to be marked againſt the Papiſts,That Chriſt was born was crucified, vvas buried, &c.
which ſaie, That faith is onelie a knowledge and an aſſenting
to the ſtorie. For Saint Paule expreſſelie in this



place ioineth confidence with faith, which is the note or
marke of a iuſtifieng faith. Againe, héere are ſet downe
for vs to view, thrée degrées of faith. The firſt is, to beléeue
and agrée to the promiſes of the Goſpell. The ſecond
is, confidence of mercie craued in Chriſt. The third
is, boldneſſe to goe vnto God, and to call vpon him. To
conclude, this place teacheth vs, that calling vpon God
cannot be without confidence in Chriſt. For, as by confidence
we haue entrance vnto God: ſo without confidence,
there is no comming to God.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 13.
                  
                  13 Wherefore I deſire that ye
faint not at my tribulations, for
your ſakes vvhich is your glorie.
                  VVherefore I deſire, that you
faint not, becauſe of mine afflictions,
for your ſakes, which is your
praiſe.
                  THe ſecond part of the Chapter now followeth, which
ſtandeth vpon exhortation. For the Apoſtle exhorteth
the Epheſians that they fall not from the Goſpell, becauſe
he being their Teacher is perſecuted & troubled. Now,
this propoſition is brought in vpon the former matter,
in this ſort: Becauſe the myſterie is ſo excellent, which
God hath opened vnto you, concerning the obteining of
ſaluation fréelie giuen, by me, whom God hath called to
be your Apoſtle, I would not wiſh you to plaie the ſlowbackes,
or to growe out of heart, for the afflictions
and croſſes ſake which I ſuffer, and am preſſed downe
withall.
                  To this propoſition he addeth two reaſons: the firſt,
from the cauſe efficient: the ſecond, from the end of perſecution,
and the fruite of conſtancie. (For your ſakes,)
ſaith the Apoſtle, that is to ſaie: For this cauſe haue the
ſpitefull Iewes deliuered me vp priſoner into the hands
of the Romans, becauſe I haue preached the Goſpell vnto
you, therfore I lie bound in priſon, not for anie déede



that I haue committed like an offender: but for faithfullie
diſcharging my dutie and office, whereto God hath
appointed me.
                  Afterwards, in ſaieng: (Which is your glorie,) he
noteth, that the ende of his perſecution is not the ſhame
of the Epheſians, but rather their glorie, ſithence they
maie ſee themſelues embracers of ſuch a doctrine: as for
the truth and excellencie whereof, their teacher is not afeard
to ſuffer, euen extreame troubles. Wherefore, it is
meete, that they alſo be conſtant to mainteine this doctrine,
and valiant likewiſe againſt the ſharpe ſtormes of
afflictions. Hetherto we haue declared the Apoſtles meaning:
now let vs gather a fewe ſpecialties to ſerue our
owne vſe.
                  The firſt, The godlie, knowing the worthineſſe and
excellencie of the Goſpell, ſhall take héede, that they ſuffer
not themſelues to be pulled from the ſame, either
with ſmooth flatterings, and alluring meanes: or with
bitter threats, and ſharpe perſecutions.
                  The ſecond, The godlie ſhall take héede, that they be
not deceiued with the iudgement and cuſtome of the
world. For, the world is woont to ſet light by thoſe things,
which men of authoritie make no accompt of. Againe,
which waie ſoeuer Fortune turneth her ſelfe, that waie
will the fauour and eſtimation of men be ſure to bend.
For preſent proſperitie, Oh: that is welcome to all.
This errour of the world being verie great, as it is dangerous,
ſo it muſt be auoided of the godlie. For godlineſſe
muſt not be iudged by the outward appearaunce,
but the nature and qualitie of the thing is rather to be
looked into, and a deliueraunce patientlie to be waited vpon,
according to the vndeceiuable promiſe of God.
                  The third, Let the miniſters of the Goſpell learne (by
the example of Saint Paule) a godlie and holie carefulneſſe
for their flocke, that it maie be kept and continued
in ſinceritie of doctrine. For, it is not inough to haue



taught aright, vnleſſe thou alſo take héede, with all thine
endeuour, that the pureneſſe of doctrine be not, by anie
kinde of occaſion, poiſoned or infected.
                  The fourth, The conſtancie of the miniſters of the
word, in bearing the croſſe, maketh the Goſpell more honourable:
& it is confirmed with the bloud of the Saints,
as it were with a certeine ſeale or ſignet.
                  The fift, A conſolation againſt the offenſe of the croſſe:
wherein this is to be learned, and borne awaie, that the
croſſe of the godlie is not ſhamefull before God, but rather
glorious: and then chiefelie, when anie one ſuffereth
for the confeſſion of true doctrine. As Saint Peter
alſo teacheth, who ſaith, that to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake,
is the great glorie of Chriſtians. For the counſell and
purpoſe of God in this point is to be conſidered,1. Pet. 13. 14. 15. &c, whoſe
pleaſure it is, to make them like to his ſonne in this
world, whom he determined with himſelfe long ſince to
glorifie with him.
                  The ſixt, Héerehence let the miniſters of the Goſpell
peculiarlie learne, not onelie when they are well, and
all things ſafe, ſtoutlie to doe their dutie, and to followe
their office manfullie: but alſo to ſhewe themſelues valiant
hearted, & noble Champions: yea euen then, when
the burthen of the Croſſe doth bow them, euen till they
bend vnder it. A ſmall matter for vs (ſaith he) which are
in health, to giue good counſell to the ſicke: A ſmall
matter conſtantlie to teach the Goſpell, when all things
are in ſafetie, when there is no ſhewe of danger toward.
But this is the propertie of a right noble heart, in the
middeſt of afflictions, in the middeſt of the flaming fire,
(as Saint Paule and other Saints haue done,) couragiouſlie
to comfort ſuch as neuer yet taſted the Croſſe, againſt
ſharpe ſhowres and tempeſts of tribulations to
come.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Verſes. 14, 15. 16. 17.
18. &. 19.
                  
                  
                     14 For this cauſe I bovv my
knees vnto the Father of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                     15 (Of whom is named the
vvhole familie in heauen & in
earth)
                     16 That he might graunt you,
according to the riches of his
glorie, that ye maie be ſtrengthened
by his ſpirit, in the inner
man,
                     17 That Chriſt maie dvvell
in your hearts by faith, that ye
being rooted and grounded in
loue,
                     18 Maie be able to comprehend
with all Saints, vvhat is
the breadth, and length, and
depth, and height:
                     19 And to knovve the loue
of Chriſt, vvhich paſſeth knowledge,
that ye maie be filled
vvith all fulneſſe of God.
                  
                  For this thing ſake I bow my
knees vnto the Father of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, of whom all
Fatherhood is named in Heauen
and in earth, that he would
giue you, according to the riches
of his glorie to be ſtrengthened
with power by his ſpirit in
the inner man, that Chriſt may
dwell in your hearts by faith,
that ye might be rooted and
grounded in loue, and maie be
able to comprehend with all
Saints, what is the breadth, &
length, and depth, and height:
and to knowe the loue of
Chriſt, which paſſeth (or is aboue)
knowledge, that ye
might be filled with all fulneſſe
of God.
                  THis is the third part of this Chapter, conteining a teſtimonie
or witneſſe-bearing of Saint Paules praier
for the Epheſians, which praier hath thrée circumſtaunces,
the firſt whereof is concerning God, whom Saint
Paule doth call vpon, who is the Father of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt.
                  The ſecond conteineth a reaſon why God alone
ſhould be called vpon: to wit, becauſe vpon him alone
all fatherlie rule & gouernment doth depend, both in heauen
and alſo in earth. The word (Fatherhood) is héere
taken for fatherlie rule & gouernment. Now, ſeing he alone
is to be called vpon, in whoſe power the ordering of



all things is, it followeth, that the Father of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt alone muſt be called vpon. But yet, this
ſpeach doth not exclude the Sonne and the holie Ghoſt:
becauſe there is one diuine eſſence or béeing, power,
and glorie of the Father, the Sonne, and the holie
Ghoſt.
                  The third circumſtance conteineth a rehearſall of thoſe
things, which the Apoſtle wiſheth to the Epheſians: to
wit, that in the partaking and poſſeſſing of heauenlie
things, they might be verie rich and plentifull. But the
Apoſtle doth firſt make his rehearſall, and afterwards in
the end compriſeth all things in generall.
                  But becauſe in this point of doctrine, there is much
to be marked, I will laie it downe in partes, to the end,
that euerie thing maie the plainlier be conſidered, and
the more easilie applied to our vſe.
                  The firſt part therefore of Saint Paules praier is
contained in theſe words: (That he might graunt you,
according to the riches of his glorie, that yee maie bee
ſtrengthened by his ſpirit, in the inner man.) Héere S.
Paule wiſheth to the Epheſians ſpirituall ſtrength: and
he ſheweth the fountaine from whence euerie good thing
floweth vnto all creatures: to wit, (The riches of his
glorie,) that is to ſaie, the euerlaſting & bottomleſſe mercie
of God. When we are praieng therefore, what muſt
wée doe? reckon vp our merits and deſeruings? No, but
boldlie truſting to Gods exceeding great goodneſſe & clemencie,
we muſt praie with faith in Chriſt. So praieth
Dauid,
                     Pſal. 51. 1. ſaieng: Miſerere, &c. Haue mercie vpon me, O
God, according to thy great mercie, & according to the
multitude of thy mercies. He addeth the cauſe efficient,
or the working cauſe, which is inward: to wit, the holie
Ghoſt, wherby we are ſtrengthened: & what maner of
ſtrength it is, which he wiſheth vnto them, he expreſſeth
in theſe words, ſaieng: (That your inner man may bee
ſtrong in the Lord.) Now, our inner man is our ſoule,



ſo farre forth as it is broken and trained vp in obedience
vnto God: ſuch a ſoule as mindeth inward things, and not
outward, eternall & heauenlie things, not temporall and
earthlie things. The ſtudies and endeuours of the outward
man are diuerſe from this. For he neglecting that
which is inward and heauenlie, is buiſie in outward,
temporall, and earthlie toies and traſh.
                  The ſecond circumſtance is declared in theſe words:
(That Chriſt maie dwell in your hearts by faith.) This
circumſtance ſheweth plainlie from whence the ſtrength
of Chriſtians doth come. For it defineth our ſtrength, to
be Chriſt himſelfe. But how? Euen by dwelling in vs.
How is this dwelling brought to paſſe? Euen by faith.
Where, or in what part of vs? Euen in our hearts. For
it is not inough to haue a kinde of knowledge of Chriſt,
it ſkils not what, or how: but the affection of the heart
muſt be preſent, which is a ſtedfaſt confidence in Chriſt,
with which confidence béeing armed, we cannot be ouercome,
but are able to withſtand hell gates, according to
that ſaieng of S. Iohn,
                     1. Iohn. 5. 4 
                     Haec eſt victoria, &c. This is the
victorie which ouercommeth the world, euen your faith.
This place deſerueth chieflie to be marked. For it doth
not onelie teach, that Chriſt dwelleth by faith in them
that belieue: but it diſproueth the Papiſts, which define
faith to be a certaine knowledge and agréeing to theThe meaning of this place is before ſet dovvne. ſtorie,
without confidence of heart.
                  The third circumſtance, (That ye maie be rooted
and grounded in loue,) teacheth vs what is the force of
faith, in reſpect of our neighbour. For, ſo ſoone as he had
made mention of faith, by and by hée ſetteth downe the
effect or fruite of the ſame: to wit, true and heartie loue
towardes our neighbour: which hée doth for a double
purpoſe: namelie, to ſhewe the true qualitie of faith: and
alſo to teach vs, in what thing the perfection of Chriſtians
doth conſiſt. But what manner of loue doth faith
require? Forſooth, ſuch a loue as is rooted and grounded:



that is to ſaie, ſuch a loue as is ſound & ſteddie, which is
not moued & made to vaniſh like ſmoke, vpon euerie light
occaſion. Héerehence let vs learne, that how much more
we profit and doe good in the ſchoole of Chriſt: ſo much
more we growe and increaſe in the workes of loue, and
are, as it were rooted. For it cannot bée, that he ſhould
be voide of loue, which poſſeſſeth Chriſt truelie by faith.
                  The fourth circumſtance is, (That yee maie be able
to comprehend with all Saintes, what is the breadth, &
length, and depth, and higth:) to wit, of the myſterie
of Gods grace, and Chriſts loue towards vs. For ſo the
Apoſtle expoundeth himſelfe, ſaieng: That ye maie know
the vnmeſurable loue of Chriſt towards you. For as the
mercie of God the Father paſſeth all his workes, according
to the wordes of Dauid:
                     Pſal. 145. 9 ſo the loue of God the
Sonne, is beyond all meaſure alſo. For, if thou beholdeſt
the breadth thereof, it cannot be compaſſed within anie
boundes: if thou conſidereſt the length thereof, it reacheth
euen to all the ends of the world: if thou caſt thine
eies vpon the deapth thereof, it ſtoopeth downe, euen to
the vileſt and baſeſt things in the world: if thou looke aloft
vpon the higth thereof, it is farre aboue the heauens.
This is the plaine and true meaning of this place: as
for the trifles and toies of the Lordes woodden croſſe,
and of the round globe or compaſſe of the whole worlde,
let vs leaue them, they are nothing: and therefore let
them goe.
                  This place miniſtreth a moſt fruitfull comfort againſt
all lets and impediments, which ſéeme to hinder our ſaluation.
For, if Chriſt loueth vs ſo déerelie, it cannot be,
(ſo that we abide in him by faith, euen to the end) that any
creture ſhould caſt a blocke betwéene vs & our ſaluation.
                  The fift circumſtance, (That ye maie be filled with
all fullneſſe of GOD) comprehendeth in a ſumme,
whatſoeuer belongeth to that perfection and fulneſſe,
which GOD requireth of vs. Nowe, the fulneſſe



of God, is Chriſtian perfection, whereby we doe fullie,
that is to ſaie, without colourable diſſembling and hypocriſie,
ſubmit our ſelues vnto God. Such are all they,
which kéepe the faith, and a good conſcience.
                  Héerehence we learne, in what things Chriſtians muſt
chieflie finde themſelues occupied: namelie, in labouring
more and more to come by perfection. For there is none,
that hath profited and done ſo much good in the ſchoole of
Chriſt, but hath néede of increaſe. Héere therefore is their
vanitie and péeuiſhneſſe reproued, which hauing ſcarſlie
had anie ſmacke at all of things belonging to God; and
ſauouring of heauenlie wiſdome, thinke none ſo ſpirituall
as themſelues, not once minding to profit anie more,
or to goe forward anie whit at all.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 20. & 21.
                  
                  
                     20 Vnto him therefore that
is able to doe exceeding abundantlie,
aboue all that vve aſke
or thinke, according to the
povver that vvorketh in vs,
                     21 Be praiſe in the Church by
Chriſt Ieſus, throughout all generations
for euer, Amen.
                  
                  But vnto him that is able to
doe moſt abundantlie aboue all
that we aſke or thinke, according
to his power working in
vs, euen vnto him bee glorie in
the Church by Ieſus Chriſt,
through out all generations
from age to age, Amen.
                  THis is the fourth part of this Chapter, conteining a
praiſing or glorifieng of Gods name, whereinto the
Apoſtle falleth, anon after he had made rehearſall of
Gods benefits. For, the whole benefit of our redemption
ſerueth héereto, that all glorie might be giuen to God.
Wherefore the Apoſtle (ſurelie verie well) hath ſhut vp
the firſt part of his Epiſtle with thankeſgiuing.
                  Furthermore, bicauſe there are diuerſe circumſtances
of this place, let vs conſider and ſkanne them ſeuerallie.
The firſt is, a making mention of Gods (Power) whereby
he is able to do all things whatſoeuer hée will: and



will performe all things whatſoeuer he hath promiſed.
This (Power) of God ſhould firſt of all eſtabliſh our hope
touching Gods promiſes, then it ſhould be ſette againſt
the Diuell, death, and hell: yea, againſt the ſubtile reaſons
of the fleſh, whereby the faith of weaklings is oftentimes
ſhaken. Beſides theſe, it ſhould ſtirre vs vp to
the feare of God: for God by his (Power) can puniſh
the ſtubburne, and make them ſtoope. Laſtlie, it maie bée
laide in their waie, which erroniouſlie and blaſphemouſlie
robbe God of his glorie, and giue the ſame to Saintes
and Idols.
                  The ſecond is a mention making of Gods liberalitie,
who beſtoweth vpon vs farre greater benefites, than either
we can craue or conceiue. This ought not onelie to
pricke vs vnto thanksgiuing: but to kindle in vs a greater
and a feruenter faith.
                  The third, from whence the deſire and delight in vs
to praie doth procéed and come: namelie from hence, becauſe
the (Power) of God is forceable in vs: which (Power)
doubtleſſe, is not of fleſh, or bloud, but of the ſpirit of
God, and of faith.
                  The fourth is a pointing out (as it were) of the
place, where true glorie maie be giuen to God, which is
the Church of the Saintes, or congregation of the faithfull.
For the Church is a certaine Theatre in the
world, whereon God will haue his glorie ſhewed and
ſéene, according to that ſaieng of Dauid: Laus eius in
Eccleſia Sanctorum,
                     Pſal. 149. 1 
                     His praiſe bee in the congregation
of Saints.
                  
                  The fift is a declaring of the meane or waie, whereby
glorie ought to be giuen unto God, (By Chriſt Ieſus,)
ſaith the Apoſtle. For none can giue praiſe and glorie to
God, vnleſſe they be in Chriſt by faith. Therefore ſaith
Saint Ambroſe, Per Chriſtum, &c. Through Chriſt we
muſt giue God thanks, becauſe God giueth vs all things
through Chriſt.
                  
                  
                     
The ſixt is the continuance and long laſting of the
praiſe and glorie which is to be giuen to God. (Through
out all generations, ſaith the Apoſtle, for euer, Amen.)
This euerlaſting praiſe and glorie of God, putteth vs
in minde of two things. The firſt is, that we which are
the members of Chriſt, ſhould perpetuallie and for euer
praiſe and glorifie God in Chriſt, after the example of
Dauid,
                     Pſal. 119. 164. who ſaith thus: Septies in die, &c. Seuen times a
daie I haue ſong praiſes vnto thee, bicauſe of the iudgements
of thy righteouſneſſe. The ſecond is, that we
ſhould knowe, that the Church of God ſhall perpetuallie
and for euer remaine, and neuer haue end. For, if glorie
and praiſe muſt be giuen to God (For euer), & that cannot
be done elſe-where, ſaue in the Church, it followeth
that the Church ſhall neuer be put downe, or come to an
end. Then ſéeing it is ſo, it ſhall be preſerued and
maintained héere in this world, till the daie of
iudgement: and alſo after the reſurrection
of all fleſh it ſhall continue
in all eternitie and euerlaſtingneſſe,
praiſing and
glorifieng God
for euer.
               
            
         
         
            
            ¶THE FOVRTH CHAPTER.
            
               ¶THE SVMME OF THE
fourth Chapter.
               OYe Epheſians, forſomuch as ye are called vnto ſo
great grace, méet & requiſite it is, that in harmeleſnes
and vprightneſſe of life ye aunſwere ſo holie a calling.
Wherefore I exhort you, that yée abandon all Gentiliſme
or heatheniſhneſſe, and endeuour your ſelues to holineſſe
of life.
            
            
               ¶THE ORDER OF THE
fourth Chapter.
               AFter Doctrine the Apoſtle addeth exhortations, according
to the manner of the Prophets and Apoſtles:
and firſt he ſetteth downe a generall propoſition: to wit,
That the Epheſians ſhould walke worthy their vocation.
Then, like a workman, by litle & litle he procéedeth from
the cauſes, and gathereth in what the whole ſumme conſiſteth:
namelie, in mutuall loue: wherevnto he ioineth
reaſons. But leaſt anie ſhould abuſe the excellencie of
gifts, to the contempt and deſpite of their neighbours, hee
ſheweth the end of thoſe gifts▪ wherwith Chriſt doth beautifie
his Church. To this alſo he addeth manie ſpecialties,
which in a full propoſition, as in a generalitie, are conteined,
and interlaceth compariſons of vertues and vices.
He putteth them in minde of their former ſtate vnder
Gentiliſme or heatheniſhneſſe, to the end that the filthineſſe
of their offences béeing diſcouered and knowne,
they ſhould giue themſelues to holineſſe of life, and abandon
vices. And ſo, as the former part of the Epiſtle
is didaſcalicall, that is to ſaie, tending to inſtruction,
and conteineth the doctrine of ſaluation freelie giuen:
euen ſo the latter part thereof is paraineticall,



that is to ſaie, ſtandeth vpon exhortation, and frameth vnto
vs a Chriſtian life.
            
            
               ¶THE EXPOSITION OF THE
fourth Chapter, with the obſeruation of
doctrines therein contained.
               
                  
                     Verſes. 1. 2. &. 3.
                  
                  
                     1 I therefore beeing priſoner
in the Lord, praie you, that ye
vvalke vvorthie of the vocation
vvherevnto yee are called,
                     2 With all humbleneſſe of
minde, and meekneſſe, vvith
long ſuffering, ſupporting one
an other through loue,
                     3 Endeuouring to keepe the
vnitie of the ſpirit in the bonde
of peace.
                  
                  I therefore, which am in bonds
for the Lordes ſake, exhort you
that yee walke worthie of the
calling wherewith yee are called,
in all lowlineſſe and meekneſſe,
with long ſuffering, forbearing
one an other, in loue,
doing your diligence to keepe
the vnitie of the ſpirit in the
bond of peace.
                  
                     THe propoſition ſtandeth vpon exhortation
or perſuaſion. For the Apoſtle exhorteth
and perſuadeth the Epheſians, to the leading
of a life worthie of the Goſpel. In
this propoſition there are manie things
to be marked. Firſt, the Apoſtle maketh
mention of his impriſonment, & that not onelie to declare
his affection towards the Epheſians: who, although hée
was caſt into priſon for the Goſpels ſake, yet he did not
ceaſſe to exhort them to things ſeruing for their ſaluation:
but alſo that he might grow in countenance & credit
among them, for whoſe ſake he feared not to aduenture
the vttermoſt dangers. In this place therefore let the miniſters
of the Goſpell be admoniſhed, of the lot & croſſe,
that is common to them all, which they are compelled to
beare, through the tyrannie of this vnthankfull world: &
by the example of S. Paule, let them learne to be conſtant,
leaſt through accuſtomed vnthankfulneſſe they renounce
their profeſſion, & leaue the ſtanding wherein God hath



placed them. 
                        〈…〉
                      to ſuffer for the profeſſion
of 
                        〈…〉
                     ; but rather an exceeding glorie. For
to 
                        〈◊〉
                      the greateſt daungers of all, with a willing
mind, for the goſpell ſake, is a certeine ſeale (as it were)
of their doctrine.
                  Secondlie, when the Apoſtle ſaith, (I praie you that
you walke worthie of the vocation wherevnto ye are
called,) he compriſeth in a ſumme, what beſéemeth Chriſtians,
which are called to the partaking of heauenlie
grace. Now, in this place that generall vocation or calling
of all Chriſtians is to be vnderſtood, whereby we
are called from darkneſſe, to light: from ſinne, to righteouſneſſe:
from curſſe, to bleſſing: from death, to life:
from damnation, to iuſtification and ſaluation: from
hell, to heauen: to be ſhort, from the kingdome of the
Diuell, which is full of all kinde of miſeries, to the glorious
kingdome of Chriſt. This wonderfull chaunging
of our condition, ought worthilie to ſtirre vs vp to thankfulneſſe.
For, if in the world, he that diſchargeth his office
notablie, and is aduaunced into higher place of promotion,
thinketh it a filthie thing, to ſtaine his degrée of
honour with ſome fowle fault: and on the other ſide, who
ſoeuer outreacheth the reſt, in vertue & noble déeds, bringeth
the more beautie and renowme to his place: what
ſhall we ſaie of them, which haue obteined this dignitie,
to be called and counted not onelie Holie Prophets,
Kings, or Spirituall Prieſts: but alſo The children of
God. This neceſſitie therefore of chaunging the condition
of our former ſtate, being badde, into a better, is diligentlie
to be conſidered, that it might ſtirre vs vp to
lead a life worthie of ſo great and excellent a calling, in
all ſoberneſſe, righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe. For we are
called (as Saint Paule ſaith elſewhere) Not vnto filthineſſe,
                     1. Cor. 1. 2.
                     but vnto ſanctification and holineſſe.
                     2. Cor. 7. 1. Héereto
ſerueth that place alſo of the Apoſtle to Titus:
                     1. Theſ. 4. 7 
                     Apparuit
gratia,
                     Tit. 2. 11. 12. 13. 14. 
                     &c. The grace of God, that bringeth ſaluation



vnto all men, hath appeared: and teacheth vs that we
ſhould denie vngodlineſſe, and worldlie luſts, and that
we ſhould liue ſoberlie, and righteouſlie, and godlie in
this preſent world: looking for the bleſſed hope and
appearing of the glorie of the mightie God, and of our
Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: who gaue himſelfe for vs, that he
might redeeme vs from all iniquitie, and purge vs to
be a peculiar people vnto himſelfe, zealous of good
workes.
                  
                  Thirdlie, becauſe the Apoſtle is exhorting the Epheſians
to (Vnitie of ſpirit,) that is to ſaie, to concord and
agréement, he laieth the foundations thereof, whiles
he requireth at their hands, (Humbleneſſe of minde,
meekneſſe, long ſuffering, and bearing one with an
other through loue.) Of theſe Chriſtian vertues I
will ſaie ſomewhat, to the ende that the differencies
and properties of them maie the better be ſeene and
knowne.
                  (Humbleneſſe,) which the Greekes call 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
is a vertue of the minde, which doth ſo rule a godlie
man, that he thinketh not too well, either of himſelfe,
or of his giftes: but rather abaſeth himſelfe vnder all
men, in the feare of God, giuing to God all glorie and
praiſe. This vertue is the verie next fruite of true repentaunce,
which taketh vnto it dailie new increaſings,
ſo that it be true and naturall, and not falſe and counterfait.
Now, this holie (Humbleneſſe) increſeth & groweth
by foure things. The firſt is, by the acknowledgement
of our owne vnableneſſe and weakneſſe. The ſecond is,
by conſidering the ende of Gods giftes, which he hath giuen
vs: for our giftes are diuerſe. And why? Euen that
the benefite of them maie be common: that is to ſaie, to
the edifieng one of another, in the bodie of Chriſt. The
third is, by binding our ſelues to ſerue others, according
to the parable in the Goſpell. For, Of him which hath
more, more ſhall be required. The fourth is, by thinking



throughlie vpon Gods counſell, purpoſe, and prouidence,
who oftentimes bringeth to paſſe, that they which
ſéeme to haue but ſmall giftes, beſtowe more trauell in
building vp Gods Church, than they which excell in diuerſitie
of gifts.
                  (Meekneſſe) followeth Humbleneſſe aptlie, after the
Apoſtles order: and it is the childe as it were of Humbleneſſe.
Now, (Meekneſſe,) which the Greekes call

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , is a kind of calmeneſſe in the mind, whereby as
anie one bridleth himſelfe from being angrie or wroth:
ſo he ſheweth himſelfe gentle and faire ſpoken to others.
The contraries to this, are fierceneſſe, madneſſ, frowardneſſe,
ſtubborneſſe, waiwardneſſe, and ſuch like vices,
which turne the calmeneſſe of the minde, into a
ſtorme and tempeſt.
                  (Long ſuffering,) which the Greekes call 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     :
the Latiniſts, Longanimitas: is a companion of
Méekneſſe: and it is a certeine mildeneſſe of the minde,
giuing place vnto wrong, and parting from ones owne
right, for quietneſſe ſake. For ſo Saint Paule ſéemeth
to define this vertue, when he addeth theſe words, (Supporting
one another through loue, endeuouring to keepe
the vnitie of the ſpirit,) that is, the concord or agréement
of mindes, (In the bond of peace.) For loue knitteth
vs together as it were with linkes: euen as the
members of the bodie, béeing faſtened together by
ioints, are ruled by one ſpirit. When therefore the
heart is reformed by Gods ſpirit, and brought vnder,
by true humbleneſſe, méekeneſſe, and long ſuffering,
we ſhall then well inough awaie with others, amend
them that haue done amiſſe, and alſo loue one another
with true loue, according to the Lords commandement.
                  This place of the Apoſtle is diligentlie to be marked.
For he ſheweth, at what thing the true agréement
of mindes in the Saints muſt take beginning: namelie,



at the rooting out of all ſuch vices, as are plagues to concord
and vnitie: ſuch are theſe, hawtineſſe, haſtineſſe, frowardneſſe,
fierceneſſe, waiwardneſſe, &c. Heereto ſerueth
the ſaieng of Solomon,
                     Pro. 13. 10 
                     Onelie by pride doth man make
contention.
                     Matt. 11. 29. And Chriſt ſaith, Learne of me, becauſe I
am meeke and humble in heart. In which words Chriſt
commandeth the bridling of two affections: namelie, deſire
of reuengement, and pride. For as (Humbleneſſe)
of heart is flat againſt pride: ſo is (Meekneſſe) flat againſt
deſire of reuengement. Chriſt ſaith, that the brideling
of theſe affections, is the bearing of his yoke. For
he that hath found reſt in Chriſt, and a refreſhing after
his labours, & an acquittance from the Lawe which condemneth,
ought not therevpon to take libertie to ſinne:
but 
                        〈◊〉
                     , being raiſed vp and comforted by the grace
of Chriſt, to take vp Chriſts yoke, and to chaine in the
lewd luſts of the fleſh.
                  This yoke of Chriſt ſhall not then be cumberſome
or tedious vnto vs, but eaſie and light, when we are once
vſed to (Meekneſſe and humbleneſſe,) after his example,
being propt vp with true confidence and beliefe in him.
Contrariwiſe, ſuch as hold ſcorne to carrie the yoke of
Chriſt, let them hardlie (euen as they deſerue) be made
ſubiect to the rule and power of the Diuell, and lie troden
vnder his féete. For it cannot otherwiſe be, but that
euerie one of vs muſt beare the yoke, either of Chriſt, or
elſe of Chriſts aduerſarie.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 4. 5. &. 6.
                  
                  
                     4 There is one bodie, & one
ſpirit, euen as ye are called in
one hope of your vocation.
                     5 There is one Lord, one faith,
one baptiſme.
                     6 One God and Father of all,
vvhich is aboue all, & through

                           〈◊〉
                        , and in you all.
                  
                  There is one bodie and one
ſpirit, euen as ye are alſo called
in one hope of your calling. There
is ou
                        •
                      one Lord, one faith, one
baptisme, one God and Father

                        〈◊〉
                      all which is aboue all, and
through all, and in you all.
                  
                     
THis is a confirmation of the propoſition, wherein is
ſet downe before vs, a heape of reaſons or arguments,
all which hang vpon this one principle: That
which is one, ought in no caſe to be at ſtrife and debate
with it ſelfe. The aſſumption or minor is this: The
Church is one: héervpon followeth the concluſion, which
is this, Ergo the Church ought in no caſe to be at ſtrife
& debate with it ſelfe. The aſſumption or minor, becauſe
it is to be proued, is confirmed with ſtore of reaſons.
But that all things maie be knowne at the full, we will
conſider euerie thing by it ſelfe ſeuerallie, and that
briefelie.
                  Firſt therefore he ſaith, that (There is one bodie, and
one ſpirit,) that is to ſaie, Euen as Chriſtians are the
members of one and the ſelfe ſame bodie:1. Co. 12. 12 ſo it is meete,
that they being quickened by one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit,
ſhould agree together in holie loue. For, as all the
members of one and the ſelfe ſame bodie, are quickened
and gouerned by one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit: euen ſo
muſt all Chriſtians behaue themſelues one towards another,
that they maie ſeeme to be lead and guided by one
minde & heart, ſéeing they are all but one bodie in Chriſt.
Whoſoeuer therefore departeth from vnitie and concord,
he muſt néeds depart from the bodie of Chriſt,
which is the Church.
                  Héerevpon it followeth, that they, which mainteine
not ſtedfaſtlie holie loue and vnitie among themſelues,
doe boaſt and bragge of the title of the Church, all in
waſte. And leaſt we ſhould ſuffer our ſelues to be withdrawne
and pluckt awaie from the Church, vnder a
vaine ſhewe & counterfaite colour of vnitie, let vs marke
the reaſon of vnitie, which followeth: (Euen as ye are
called in one hope of your vocation,) ſaith the Apoſtle:
that is to ſaie, I would ſo haue you all to be one, euen as
ye are called to one and the ſelfe ſame inheritance, which
at this inſtant ye poſſeſſe by hope, according to the word



of your calling. It is the Apoſtles will therefore, that
we ſhould not depart from the word of our calling, that
is to ſaie, from the pure doctrine of our calling, from
whence the ſoundation of loue and vnitie muſt be fetcht.
For he that departeth from the Goſpell, whereby God
calleth: he departeth from the vnitie of the Church,
from the which when a man is once ſeparated, it cannot
be that he ſhould be gouerned by the ſpirit: euen as anie
member or limme of the bodie, being cut off from the bodie,
is no more ruled by the life, which is in the bodie.
                  Now followeth the heape of reaſons. (There is one
Lord,) to wit, of the Catholike or vniuerſall Church:
namelie, Chriſt Ieſus, whom all the faithfull ought of
dutie to ſerue, in vnitie of ſpirit, and agréement of mind.
For, if it be a fowle and reprochfull thing, that houſehold
ſeruaunts, which haue but one and the ſelfe ſame
earthlie maiſter, ſhould fall out and brall among themſelues:
and not rather with one conſent & agréement do
that which they are commanded: what (I beſéech you)
ſhall be more fowle and reprochfull, than that Chriſtians,
which haue but one maiſter in heauen, the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, ſhould be at diſagréement & defiaunce among
themſelues? ſpeciallie, ſéeing there is (But one faith) of
all in him, whereby they ſtaie and reſt themſelues vpon
him alone, being the onelie Lord and alone redéemer of
all: which (Faith) indéed, ſéeing it is but one and the
ſelfe ſame: that is to ſaie, of one and the ſelfe ſame promiſe:
it is méete, that they to whom this (One faith)
is giuen, ſhould alſo maintaine among themſelues, one
vnitie, or oneneſſe.
                  To this alſo belongeth that which followeth. (One
baptiſme:) to wit, common to all, whereby we are ingraffed
into Chriſts bodie, & as it were incorporate with
him. (One God and Father of all, which is aboue all, and
through all, and in you all:) that is to ſaie, which ruleth
ouer all, and by his prouidence and gouernment ordereth



and diſpoſeth all, dwelling in all the godlie by faith. And
although theſe words, (Aboue all, & through all,) maie
be referred to the vniuerſall gouernment and rule of all
things: yet the circumſtanunce of the place maketh a reſtraint,
ſo that they are to be applied to the Church, chieflie
in this place. The meaning of the words therfore is
this, (Aboue all) noteth the ſouereigne rule of one God
ouer the Church: (Through all,) betokeneth his prouidence
ouer ſpreading all and euerie member of the
Church: (In all) ſignifieth the coupling or knitting of
vs together with Chriſt. Whoſoeuer therefore breaketh
brotherlie loue or agréement, he neither knoweth nor
confeſſeth theſe thrée doctrines. To be briefe, whoſoeuer
is not moued with theſe reaſons and arguments of vnitie,
to deſire and endeuour to liue in loue and concord, we
maie well enough thinke that he or ſhe hath not ſo much
as one little crumbe of the ſame in them.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 7.
                  
                  7 But vnto euerie one of vs is
giuen grace according to the
meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.
                  But vnto euerie one of vs grace
is giuen, according to the meaſure
of Chriſts gift.
                  THis is a figure called Prolepſis, and maie be called
in Engliſh, Preſumption, whereby the Apoſtle
cutteth off a quarrellous demand. If all things, which
are héere rehearſed, are common the Chriſtians, how
then commeth it to paſſe, that we are not equall in
giftes belonging to the Church? Why hath this man
a greater gifte, and that man a leſſer? Surelie this
vnequall giuing of giftes, is the ſéede of ſtrife and enuie:
as maie be ſéene in the Corinthians, and in manie
others.
                  The Apoſtle anſwereth, that grace is giuen to euerie
one, euen as it pleaſeth Chriſt, who beſtoweth his gifts,



not onelie to the priuate vſes of euerie one for himſelfe,
but alſo to the profite, maintenaunce, and preſeruation of
the whole bodie: to wit, that one ſhould edifie another
with their gifts, in the bodie of Chriſt. Hauing therefore
ſhewed the authour and giuer of diuerſe gifts in the
Church, he cutteth off all matter of boaſting, and all
cauſe of deſpiſing others, which ſéeme to haue receiued
ſmaller gifts. If manie would conſider this well, they
would not ſwell ſo much in their owne wiſedome, but
euerie one would ſerue other the more, with their gifts,
through loue. Let vs therefore learne héerehence, to be
content both with our eſtate, and giftes: and to laie out
vpon the edifieng one of another, whatſoeuer giftes the
Lord of life hath lent vs.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 8.
                  
                  8 Wherefore he ſaith, When he
aſcended vp on high, he lead captiuitie
captiue, and gaue giftes
vnto men.
                  VVherefore he ſaith, VVhen
he aſcended vp on high, he lead
captiuitie captiue, and gaue gifts
vnto men.
                  BY the teſtimonie of Dauid he proueth, that Chriſt is
the Author of all ſuch giftes, as euerie ſeuerall member
hath in the Church. Now this teſtimonie is well to
be marked, becauſe it conteineth a Propheſie concerning
the triumph of Chriſt aſcending vp into heauen, which
triumph Dauid ſawe in ſpirit, a thouſand yeares before
it came to paſſe. This teſtimonie is taken out of the
68. Pſalme, which is a praiſing of Chriſt triumphant,
whom Dauid confeſſeth openlie to be Iehouah,
                     Pſal. 68. 4. that is,
the true God.
                  Furthermore, this verſe of the Apoſtle, borrowed of
Dauid, conteineth two things. The firſt, a Propheſie of
Chriſts aſcending into heauen. The ſeconde, a double
fruite of his glorious aſcending: the firſt whereof is, his



triumph ouer death, ſinne, hell, and the Diuels kingdome,
which is to be vnderſtood vnder this word (Captiuitie.)
This triumph, as it began in Chriſt our head: ſo
it ſhall be ended in the reſt of his bodie, which is his
Church, at ſuch time as we ſhall all riſe againe, at the
commaundement and voice of Chriſt. For then ſhall all
the godlie enioie euerlaſting victorie with Chriſt, their
enimies béeing vanquiſhed and ſhaken off with ſhame.
The thinking vpon this our triumph to come, ought of
right to comfort vs, when we be kept vnder the Croſſe.
For he, which is certaine of a glorious deliuerance, ſetteth
leſſe by his preſent gréeuance.
                  The ſecond fruit of the Lordes aſcending, which the
Apoſtle toucheth, is conteined in theſe words, (And gaue
gifts vnto men.) For, to this purpoſe Chriſt aſcended,
that he might deale gifts vnto his Church, whereby ſhée
might be edified & maintained in this life. For, as on the
day of Pentecoſt, he ſent the holie Ghoſt downe to his Apoſtles,
appearing in a viſible ſhape vnto them, & likewiſe
gaue them power againſt the Diuell and his members:
euen ſo at this daie alſo, the ſame Lord Ieſus beautifieth
his Church with diuerſe gifts, and he alone mainteineth
the ſame, neuer purpoſing to forſake and leaue her
vnprouided.
                  Héerehence therefore let vs fetch comfort, when wée
lie groning vnder the Croſſe. For, although the Diuell
ſetteth vpon the Church, with ſundrie kindes of engines,
& by ſubtile ſnares violentlie ruſheth vpon euerie member
of the ſame: yet ſhall he not in triumph tread ſtill
vpon her necke, & kéepe her vnder alwaies, though ſhée be
held downe for a time. For Chriſt is the triumpher, who
ſitting at the right hand of God, maintaineth his Church,
defendeth her, and ſtrengtheneth her: yea, hée comforteth
all and euerie one of her members with his holie ſpirit.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Verſes. 9. &. 10.
                  
                  
                     9 Novv, in that he aſcended,
vvhat is it, but that he had alſo
deſcended firſt into the lovveſt
parts of the earth?
                     10 He that deſcended, is euen
the ſame that aſcended, farre aboue
all heauens, that he might
fill all things.
                  
                  Now, that hee aſcended,
what meaneth it, but that hee
alſo deſcended firſt into the
lower partes of the earth. Hee
that deſcended, is euen the ſelfe
ſame that aſcended aboue all
heauens, that hee might fill all
things.
                  THeſe words muſt be read in a Parentheſis. For, out
of the teſtimonie of the Pſalmiſt alreadie cited, the
Apoſtle gathereth two things, by the figure of Digreſsion.
The one is of Chriſts abaſing: the other of his glorifieng.
For, in that (He aſcended) he ſignifieth that (His
deſcending), that is to ſaie, his abaſing went before,
which came to paſſe, by taking vpon him mans nature,
by his paſſion, and by his death. This argument or reaſon
of the Apoſtle were altogether weake, if hée had not
vnderſtood and knowne, that the word which was in the
beginning, and euerlaſting, abaſed himſelfe, in taking vpon
him the ſhape of a ſeruaunt, wherein hée was alſo
mad? obedient euen to the death of the croſſe. Againe, in
that he (Aſcended), Saint Paule gathereth the glorifieng
of Chriſt, and his power, whereby hee now fulfilleth
all things, which make for the perfect eſtate of his
Church.
                  Moreouer, they which out of this place doe conclude,
that Chriſt deſcended and went downe into hell, and to
the place of the damned, build (God wot) vpon a verie
weake foundation. For, the Apoſtle heere doth not make
a compariſon of one part of the earth to an other: but
compareth the whole earth with heauen, as if he ſhould
ſaie: The eternall word vouchſafed to come downe from
his heauenlie glorie, vnto vs miſerable men, which
liue and are conuerſant héere in earth, that he might be
made man, and become an oblation for mankinde.
                  
                     
Furthermore, becauſe the Lord is heere ſaid, (To haue
aſcended farre aboue all heauens,) there are ſome which
gather thervpon, that the bodie of Chriſt is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
not limitable. For (as they ſaie) aboue the heauens there
is no place. But as for this ſubtile ſhift, let vs leaue it
to Sophiſters and Queſtioniſts: and let vs conſtantlie
kéepe and ſticke to the Articles of our beliefe, wherin we
confeſſe, that Chriſt was verie man, & ceaſeth not yet ſo
to be: wherefore it is true, that he hath a verie bodie, limitable:
and a verie ſoule, limitable likewiſe, wherewith
he ſhall come at the latter daie to iudge the quicke &
the dead. For, he aſcended not to chaunge the nature of
his manhood, into the nature of his Godhead: but, as the
Apoſtle ſaith (I'o fill all things), and that by the maieſtie
and power of his godhead, wherewith he will be preſent
with vs, euen to the ende of the world, according to his
promiſe.
                  
                     Héereof the Catholike Church of Chriſt beareth witneſſe
with vs. Saint Auguſtine ſaith, Sed quoniam, &c.
But bicauſe that is true,Mat. 28. 20. which hee ſpeaketh: Beholde,
I am with you euen to the end of the world, he is both
gone from vs, and he is heere among vs, and he is come
againe vnto vs, and he hath not lefte or forſaken vs. For
he carried his bodie with him into heauen, he toke not
awaie his maieſtie out of the world. Touching this, read
more in the Hiſtorie of Chriſt, which we haue written
vpon the firſt Chapter of Saint Iohn.
                  Furthermore, this place of Saint Paule ſerueth vnto
this end, euen that we, by the example of Chriſt, ſhould
be abaſed and humbled, and one ſerue an others néede
through loue, looking for the communion and partaking
of Chriſts glorie: we (I ſaie) which héere on earth, after
Chriſts example, ſuccour and make one of an other, and
edifie them with diuerſe and ſundrie duties and ſeruices
in the bodie of Chriſt.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Verſes. 11. 12. 13.
                  
                  
                     11 He therefore gaue ſome
to be Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets,
and ſome Euangeliſtes,
and ſome Paſtours, and Teachers.
                     12 For the gathering together
of the Saints, for the vvorke of
the miniſterie, & for the edification
of the bodie of Chriſt,
                     13 Till we all meere together,
(in the vnitie of faith, & knowledge
of the ſonne of God,) vnto
to a perfect man, and vnto the
meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe
of Chriſt.
                  
                  And he in deede gaue ſome to
be Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets,
and ſome Euangeliſts, and ſome
Paſtours, (or Shepheards,) &
ſome Doctours, (or Teachers)
for the reſtoring of the Saints
to the worke of the miniſterie,
and to the edifieng of the bodie
of Chriſt, till we all meete together
in the vnitie of faith &
knowledge of the ſonne of God,
vnto a perfect man, to the meaſure
of the age of Chriſtes
fulneſſe.
                  THis is a rehearſall of the giftes, wherewith Chriſt
chieflie beautifieth his Church: and it is a ſignification
alſo of the end whie theſe gifts are giuen, and whereto
they are ordeined. The gifts are theſe, (Apoſtles, Prophets,
Euangeliſts, Paſtours, and Teachers.) Although
the laſt ende of theſe be all one: to wit, (The edification
of the bodie of Chriſt:) yet their offices and charge is
diuerſe, as in the deſcriptions of them ſhall be declared.
                  The (Apoſtles) were the verie next men immediatlie
choſen of Chriſt, appointed and ordeined to teach & preach
the Goſpell, and that not in ſome certaine place, but euerie
where throughout the whole world, according to this
commaundement of Chriſt,Mark. 16. 15. 
                     Ite in vniuerſum, &c. Go ye
ouer all the world, & preach the Goſpell to euerie creature,
&c. Such were thoſe twelue, which are alſo peculiarlie
called by the names of (Apoſtles.) To theſe was S.
Paule alſo afterwards ioined,Mat. 10. 2 3. 4. who was chieflie appointed
an (Apoſtle) for the Gentiles, that he might carrie the
name of Chriſt among them. But, bicauſe this order and
degrée of men was made, that by them God might haue



his Churches gathered together and eſtabliſhed throughout
the whole compaſſe of the world: therefore ceaſſed
they (the Apoſtles I meane) when the Churches were
thus by them ſet in order and edified.
                  Of (Prophets) we maie make two orders, whereof
the one was in the olde Teſtament, the other in the
new. The (Prophets) of the olde Teſtament were they,
which béeing taught by ſpeciall reuelation from Heauen,
euen of God himſelfe, propheſied of things to come:
which when they came to paſſe, warranted the hearers
of their wordes, that their propheticall doctrine
was not voide of truth. The euents therefore, and fallings
out of their propheſies, and the ſucceſſes of the
ſame, were certaine ſeales of that heauenlie doctrine
which they deliuered to the Church. The (Prophets)
in the new Teſtament, were men indued with ſingular
wiſedome, whoſe charge and office it was, not onelie
to expounde the Scriptures, but alſo to gouerne
and keepe in order the Churches, which the Apoſtles
had aſſembled and edified: and that one while in one
place, an other while in an other place, euen as it pleaſed
the Apoſtles. This order therefore was likewiſe
temporall, and had but his time.
                  The (Euangeliſts) were companie-kéepers with the
Apoſtles. For the Apoſtles ioined the (Euangeliſtes)
with them, for the eaſing of their labours. And although
theſe alſo preached the Goſpell, as the Apoſtles did:
yet notwithſtanding, they were of a lower degrée than
the Prophets. Such were Titus, Syluanus, Apollo,
Marcus, Lucas, and Timothie, whom Saint Paule
exhorteth to doe the woorke of an (Euangeliſt:
                     2. Tim. 4. 5)
which worke appeareth to haue bene inioined to the Apoſtles,
in beſtowing their trauell in preaching the Goſpell
of Chriſt euerie where. The (Euangeliſts) therefore
were not ſent next & immediatlie of Chriſt, as the
Apoſtles were. They had not the ouer ſight and rule of



the Churches, now theſe, now thoſe, which the Apoſtles
had planted, as the Prophets did: but they were the Apoſtles
companions onelie, whoſe helpe and ſeruice they
vſed, in the diſcharging of their office. And although that
the name of an (Euangeliſt) ſignifieth generallie, anie
Preacher of the Goſpell, whom ye will: yet notwithſtanding,
it is héere taken for one certaine charge and
office, as we haue alreadie ſhewed. Sometimes alſo
thoſe foure, which wrote the hiſtorie of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, commonlie called the Goſpelles, are named
(Euangeliſtes), of whome two were likewiſe Apoſtles:
to wit, Saint Matthew, and Saint Iohn: and two
were companie-kéepers with the Apoſtles: namelie, S.
Marke, and Saint Luke.
                  
                  Thoſe were (Paſtours), whom at this daie we call the
Rectors or Miniſters of Pariſhes, (ſome, after the
olde faſhion, Pariſh Prieſts.) Theſe were appointed and
ſet ouer certaine Churches, that by preaching or making
of Sermons, by miniſtring the Sacraments, and
by a kinde of holie diſcipline and order, they ſhould rule
and gouerne them. Theſe are not for a time, but for
euer, euen to the daie of iudgement: their office is ſo
néedfull in the Church.
                  They are (Teachers,) whom the Church in olde time
called by the name of Catechiſers: whoſe office was to
ſet downe a forme and order of doctrine, and to deliuer
certaine foundations and grounds of doctrine, which the
Paſtours afterwards ſhould tie themſelues vnto, and diligentlie
folowe. Such are they which at this daie teach
and inſtruct youth in ſchooles the principles and rules of
Chriſtian religion. Theſe haue an eie to this: to wit,
that true expounding, and right order in teaching, be
kept in the Church.
                  But although in the Apoſtles time, the ceremonie of
promotion & preferment was not receiued, which at this
daie is in vſe: yet notwithſtanding, thus much we muſt



knowe, that the godlie gouernors of Churches & ſchooles,
ordeined degrées of promotions vpon good and profitable
aduiſement: both that the arrogant and hautie hearted,
ſhould not vſurpe and challenge vnto themſelues the title
of honour and worſhip, without the iudgement of the
Church: and alſo, that by open witneſſe they might be
warranted fit for that place & office, and growe in countenance
and eſtimation. Neither is this againſt the
dignitie of theOr Churches holie gouernement. eccleſiaſticall Hierarchie: which the holie
Ghoſt commendeth vnto vs. For, when the holie
Ghoſt commendeth vnto the Epheſians an order and
comelineſſe to be kept, he leaueth vnto himſelfe, the
authoritie to eſtabliſh and make rites and ceremonies,
which doe tend vnto the kéeping of order and comelineſſe.
                  There is no cauſe therefore, that we ſhould care
for the ſpeaches of proud praters, (Diuels in déed,) which
haue theſe degrées in contempt: ſo that they, on whome
theſe degrées are beſtowed, remember who they be that
ſo deſpiſe them, and alſo bethinke them, that their places
of preferment, are not ſignes or tokens of an arrogant
ouerlooking and ouerruling of others: but rather open
witneſſes of their office and charge, which they
owe vnto the Church: and to the performance whereof
they are bounde, as it were, by ſacred and ſolemne
oth.
                  But the aduerſaries peraduenture laie this in our
waie. The Church of Chriſt ſhould not be acquainted
with pompe, ſhe ſhould not be ſkilfull in ſuch things: let
her haue the triall and examining of faith and holineſſe:
let her haue praiers, and the laieng on of handes.
I aunſwere, that it is not a thing vnworthie for Chriſtians,
to beſtowe vpon godlie and learned men,
teſtimonies of their learning and honeſtie: that the
Church ſhould knowe, to whom ſhée might ſafelie commit,
and boldlie put in truſt, the gouernement and charge



of doctrine. And although ſuch manner of promotions
haue bene a long time abuſed, that makes no matter: ſo
that wée reſerue and keepe in Churches and Schooles,
ſuch things as are profitable and neceſſarie: all droſſe and
dregges béeing cleanſed quite awaie.
                  Againe,Math. 23. 8. they trip vs in our talke, ſaieng, That the
Lord did forbidde anie to be called Rabbi, and Maiſters
vpon earth, bicauſe there is but one Maiſter. I aunſwere,Mat. 23. 9
that the ſame Lorde ſaith, wée muſt call none
Father vpon earth: and yet he in his lawe giueth vs commandement
to honour our Fathers.Exod. 20. 12. Wherefore this
is to bée vnderſtoode,Mark. 7. 10. not of the name, but of ſome other
thing which was forbidden. Beſides this, the cirumſtance
of the place is ſufficient diſproofe againſt them,
which ſheweth what this forbidding meaneth. For
this followeth,Mat. 23. 11. 12. 
                     Qui maximus, &c. Hee that is greateſt
amongeſt you, ſhall bee your Miniſter, Againe,
Hee that exalteth himſelfe,
                     Luke. 14. 11. 
                     ſhall bee brought lowe.
                  
                  The Lordes will therefore was not by his forbidding,
to take awaie the name of Father, Maiſter, or
Teacher: but all arrogant confidence, and ſelfe-liking
in vs. Hée will not that wée ſooth and ſmooth our ſelues,
if wée ſéeme to excell others in ſome kinde of giftes.
Hée will not that we proudlie preferre and thinke better
of our ſelues than of others: but that hée rather,
which is the greateſt, ſhould ſhewe himſelfe a miniſter
vnto all. He will not that we ſhoulde deuiſe and ſet
abroch a new and ſtraunge doctrine, but that we ſhoulde
faithfullie followe our onelie Maiſter Ieſus Chriſt, in
matters of ſaluation.
                  Now, in that they laie load at vs with the ſaieng of S.
Iames,
                     Iam. 3. 1. 
                     Ne ſitis multi magiſtri, &c. My bretheren, be
not manie Maiſters, knowing that we ſhall receiue the
greater condemnation: that is ſoone aunſwered. For
Saint Iames to that his forbidding, addeth a reaſon,
ſaieng: In multis, &c. For in manie things we ſinne



all. So that the meaning of this inhibition or forbidding,
is this: I would that ye ſhould not be ſharpe controllers
of other mens manners.
                  Now let vs come backe to the expoſition of our text,
where the Apoſtle ſetteth downe the end of thoſe giftes,
wherewith Chriſt hath and doth beautifie his Church.
(For the gathering together of the Saints for the worke
of the miniſterie, and for the edification of the bodie
of Chriſt.) To this ende belongeth all Chriſts beſtowing
and giuing out of his gifts. This (Gathering together
of the Saints,) is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in Gréeke,
and ſignifieth properlie, a reſtoring or repairing of a
thing decaied: as when the members of the bodie, as
the bones, or ſuch like, are looſe, out of order, or beſide
their right place: but afterwards ſet in againe, faſtened,
and made ſound and whole, that all and euerie part of
the bodie, maie be in good making and liking.
                  Héerehence Saint Paule, who compareth the Church
to the bodie, applieth the word to the ſtate of the Church
well ordered and gouerned. The diuerſitie of gifts therfore,
wherewith Chriſt beautifieth his Church, belongeth
to the well ordering and gouerning of the Church. For
to this thing, as it were to the proper end, theſe gifts are
appointed. This followeth, (For the worke of the miniſterie,)
that we might knowe, what inſtrument Gods
will is to vſe, (For the gathering together of his Saints:)
to wit, (The miniſterie of the word.) Afterwards the
Apoſtle expoundeth this (Gathering together of the
Saints,) and calleth it, (The edification of the bodie of
Chriſt,) concerning which we haue ſaid ſufficient in the
ſecond Chapter.
                  Now followeth an amplification or enlargement, taken
from the circumſtance of the time, and the manner
of (the edification of Chriſts bodie, Till we all meete
together in the vnitie of faith, and knowledge of the
ſonne of God:) that is to ſaie, Till we all are made one



                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     


                     
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     


                     
in faith and in the knowledge of Chriſt. In that he
ſaith, (Till we all meete together,) it is to good purpoſe.
For he ſignifieth, that it is not one daies worke for all
of vs to be made full and perfect in Chriſt: but that it
muſt be our dailie labour, till at length we come to that
vnitie of Chriſts bodie, the cauſe of which (Vnitie) is
faith. This (Knowledge) is not a knowledge onelie of
the minde concerning Chriſt, but alſo a confidence of the
heart. For, it is not enough to knowe that Chriſt is God,
man, one perſon in Trinitie, King, Prophet, and Prieſt:
vnleſſe with ſtedfaſt confidence and boldneſſe we build
vpon him.
                  Héere the degrées of (Vnitie) muſt be marked, the
firſt whereof is, the (Knowledge) of Chriſt: from
whence (Faith) ſpringeth. By this (Faith) we are ingraffed
into Chriſt, and made as it were of his bodie.

                        •
                     eing therefore ingraffed into him, & made of his bodie,
it is our part, like members of one & the ſelfe ſame bodie,
to haue care & regard one of anothers health and good
caſe, through loue: this (I ſaie) is our dutie, who are
ioined together one with another among our ſelues, by
the ſpirit of Chriſt. Out of theſe things therefore is to
be gathered, that the (Vnitie) of the Church conſiſteth
not in traditions of men, nor in ceremonies, but in
the conſent of true doctrine and faith, from whence the
loue of one another doth ſpring.
                  Moreouer, when it is ſaid, (Vnto a perfect man, &
vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt,)
the Apoſtle expreſſeth, by a notable & trimme Metaphore,
the increaſe & growing of the Saints. For, as there are
diuerſe degrées of age: as, infancie, childhood, middleage,
oldage, dotage, &c. ſo muſt Chriſtians growe by litle
and litle, in the faith & knowledge of Chriſt. They muſt
not kéepe ſtill at the nethermoſt ſteppe, and ſtaie there:
but they muſt goe vp higher and higher, till they come to
perfectneſſe: which notwithſtanding they ſhall not obteine



at full, before they, hauing put off the olde man,
ſhalbe glorified both in ſoule and bodie, with a bleſſed life.
                  Theſe words therefore of the Apoſtle muſt not be
referred to the bodie, which is but an idle lumpe: but
to the light of the minde, and the affection of the heart:
to wit, that we ſhould knowe Chriſt trulie, and leane vpon
him with a liuelie faith, that we ſhould not be wauering,
like children, who by reaſon of their young yeares
haue not a ſettled iudgement: but like men growne to
full age, whoſe iudgement being ſteddie, they conſtantlie
mainteine the truth.
                  For, whatſoeuer is héere ſpoken of the bodie, and of
the (Meaſure of age,) it is to be applied vnto the ſpirit,
and the increaſe of the ſame. For, as the Lord himſelfe
grewe in bodie, till ſuch time as he became (A perfect
man,) and had the iuſt meaſure of his full age: euen ſo
we muſt growe in faith, and the knowledge of Chriſt,
till we are come to perfectneſſe. This to be the true
and naturall meaning of Saint Paules wordes, that
which followeth is witneſſe. For the Apoſtle is not in
hand héere with our bodies, wherewith we ſhall riſe againe:
as ſome verie vnaduiſedlie doe gather in this
place. For that maketh neuer a whit for the drift of
this preſent diſcourſe.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 14.
                  
                  14 That vve hencefoorth be
no more children, vvauering,
and carried about with euerie
vvinde of doctrine, by the deceipt
of men, and with craftineſſe,
whereby they laie in
waite to deceiue.
                  That we ſhould be children
no more, to wauer, and be carried
about with euerie blaſt of
doctrine, by the wilineſſe of
men, by craftineſſe, (or ſnares
of deceipt.)
                  THe Apoſtle declareth and ſheweth the fruit of the
ſound knowledge of Chriſt, and of faith. For, the



ſound knowledge of Chriſt, and a ſtedfaſt faith, ſtrengthen
the minds of men againſt all ſuch tempeſts, as the
ſouldiers of Sathan, dare or ſhall raiſe vp againſt the
Church. For, they that are not indued with the ſound
knowledge of Chriſt, and with faith, they eaſilie ſtagger,
and reele. And as a little ſhip or ſmall barke, not hauing
a Pilot to rule and guide it, is driuen hether and thether
with the waues and ſtreame: or as a réede is ſhaken to
and fro, according to the variableneſſe of the winde: euen
ſo they are carried awaie from true doctrine, by deceiuers
and Heretikes. We haue therefore commended vnto
vs héere, the word, and an earneſt ſtudie and endeuour
in the word, that thereby we maie be ſo confirmed,
as not to ſuffer our ſelues to be withdrawne from the
ſame, by anie craft or deceipt.
                  Furthermore, he nameth two weapons, which deceiuers
vſe againſt the Church: not that theſe are all, as
though they had no more: but becauſe theſe are the principall
& chiefe. The firſt is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which ſignifieth properlie,
the caſting of the dice, or dice-plaie, from whence
Saint Paule borrowing it, applieth it vnto ſubtile ſophiſtrie,
or wittie wiles to wreſt the ſcripture, and to deceipts,
wherewith the ignoraunt and vnlearned are eaſilie
inſnared and taken. The ſecond is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
whereby is ſignified, a certeine kinde of craftineſſe,
or ſubtile fetching in of a man: when one doth all that
he can for his life, by wiles to winde in another, and ſo
to deceiue him.
                  This the Apoſtles expoundeth himſelfe, when he ſaith:
(Whereby they laie in waite to deceiue,) that to ſaie,
by which deceiptfull déede of theirs, and craftie dealing,
they laie ſore at men to drawe them from the truth. Let
theſe things admoniſh vs, not onelie of the daunger that
commeth by falſe teachers, which goe to worke all the
waies they can, maliciouſlie to turne men from the true
knowledge of Chriſt, and from faith: & alſo of diligence



and endeuour, that we béeing eſtabliſhed in true doctrine,
maie be able both to defend our ſelues againſt all
the ſnares of deceiuers, and alſo to ſtoppe their
mouthes.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 15.
                  
                  15 But let vs follovve the truth
in loue, and in all things grovve
vp into him, vvhich is the head,
that is Chriſt.
                  But following the truth in loue,
let vs grown vp in him through all
things, which is the head, euen
Chriſt.
                  THis is an Antitheſis, or oppoſition, to the former
member. For as he made mention there, that we ſhuld
take héede of falſe doctrine, and of ſnares which deceiuers
laie to choke the true doctrine: ſo héere he biddeth
vs (Followe the truth,) that is to ſaie, ſticke to the true
doctrine, and in the faith. (For he vſeth the figure Synecdoche,
whereby vnder the word (Truth) is alſo
compriſed the affection following, according to the manner
of the ſcripture,) (And in loue one towards another:)
whereby it ſhall come to paſſe, that we ſhall (Growe vp
into Chriſt himſelfe,) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , euerie waie, (In all
things,) he béeing our head. For, how much more we
growe in the knowledge of Chriſt, in faith, and (In loue:)
ſo much more we growe in Chriſt.
                  As children therefore growe by little and litle, till
they are come to their perfect age: euen ſo it is the dutie
of Chriſtians, to growe daie by daie in the knowledge of
Chriſt, in faith, and in loue, and neuer to ceaſe till they
haue gotten perfectneſſe. All this ſerueth héereto, that
we ſhould ſubmit our ſelues vnto Chriſt our head, and
mainteine vnitie among vs one with another, as we
are all ruled by one and the ſame ſpirit of Chriſt.
                  Furthermore, Chriſt is ſaid to be the head of the
Church, in working, in perfection, in merit, and in
order. In working, becauſe he quickeneth, ſuſtaineth, and



kéepeth the Church by his ſpirit. In perfection, becauſe
he excelleth both Angels and men in wiſdome and righteouſneſſe.
In merite, becauſe he hath taken awaie
our ſinnes by his obedience of the croſſe: and by the obedience
of the lawe, hath made ſatiſfaction to the righteouſneſſe
of God, that as manie as doe beléeue in him,
ſhould be counted righteous, through the righteouſneſſe
of Chriſt. In order, bicauſe he is the Monarch and onelie
Souereigne of the Church.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 16.
                  
                  16 By whom all the bodie
beeing coupled and knit together,
by euerie ioint, for the
furniture thereof, (according
to the effectuall power, which
is in the meaſure of euerie
part,) receiueth increaſe of the
bodie, vnto the edifieng of it
ſelfe in loue.
                  By whom the whole bodie beeing
coupled and knit together, by
euerie ioint, wherewith one miniſtreth
(or ſerueth) another, according
to the operation (or working)
in meaſure of euerie part,
cauſeth (or maketh) the increaſe
of the bodie, vnto the edifieng of
it ſelfe through loue.
                  THe Apoſtle giueth a reaſon, why he calleth Chriſt the
head of the Church: and the Church the bodie of
Chriſt. Although this place appeareth at the firſt bluſh
verie obſcure and darke: yet notwithſtanding, the
meaning ſhall be verie eaſie, when the words are made
plaine, and the ſimilitude, which the Apoſtle doth not
expreſſe héere, is alſo declared. He calleth the Church
(A bodie,) howbeit not anie bodie, what ye will: but
(A bodie knit together,) or (as Saint Paule ſpeaketh
more pithilie) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is to ſaie, ſo knit and
coupled together, that it maie well and fitlie be ioined to
the head: euen as an houſe built and raiſed vpon the
foundation, by the rule and ſquare of the workeman.
Vnder this word therefore, the relation of the bodie to
the head, that is to ſaie, of the Church vnto Chriſt, is
meant, and vnderſtood.
                  
                     
Afterwards, the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Church is (A
bodie knit together by ioints:) the Gréeke word is,

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is to ſay, ſo coupled & faſtened,
that the members of the ſame hang one vpon another in
due proportion, and agrée verie well together. And thus
the relation and proportion of the members betwéene
themſelues, one with another, is ſignified (as you ſée,)
vnder this word. He ſaith this bodie is (Knit together
by euerie ioint, for the furniture thereof:) that is to
ſaie, by ioints, which carrie breath and life from one
limme to another: which breath and life is diſperſed
from the head, through all and euerie member of the
bodie, euen by the benefite and good ſeruice of the ioints,
by whoſe meanes the members of the bodie, hang one
by another, (According to the effectuall power of euerie
part,) that is to ſaie, of euerie member. For ſome
members receiue, and haue more breath and life from
the head than other ſome, whereby the whole bodie taketh
increaſe.
                  Now, the ſimilitude ſhalbe eaſier to vnderſtand. As
the bodie of man is to the head, euen ſo is the Church of
Chriſt vnto Chriſt her head: but the bodie of man ioined
vnto the head, & knit together by ioints in euerie member,
by due proportion and order, receiueth all breath and
life from the head: Ergo the Church of Chriſt ioined vnto
Chriſt her head by faith, and made fit by ſundrie ſorts
of ſeruices & vſes of loue betwéene themſelues, as it were
members, draweth all ableneſſe, and life from her head,
euen Chriſt Ieſus. Or if you pleaſe, frame the ſimilitude
in this manner.
                  As breath and life deſcending or comming
downe from the braine, by and through the ſinewes,
veines, and artires, bringeth féeling and liuelineſſe
vnto all the members, according to the proportion
of euerie one in his kinde: euen ſo Chriſt giueth
vnto vs, who are his members, his gifts, and that not at



happe hazard or raſhlie, but according to the meaſure of
euerie member: that is to ſaie, as euerie member is able
to receiue and take: and thus he maketh the whole
bodie to be builded vp, and growe together into him.
This point of doctrine deliuered vnto vs by Saint Paule,
offereth vnto vs manifold leſſons for our learning. For
firſt of all, we haue to gather héerehence, that all and euerie
of them are out of the Church, how manie ſoeuer,
which ſubmit not themſelues vnto Chriſt, in the true
knowledge of Chriſt, and in faith: and which ſetting
light by loue, are at daggers drawing one with another,
ſo excéeding great is their hatred betwéene themſelues.
                  
                     Furthermore, a true and euident deſcription of the
Church maie heerehence be taken, that it is An aſſemble
of ſuch as beleeue in the Goſpell, who cleaue ſo
cloſe vnto Chriſt their head, and are ſo knit and ioined
together betweene themſelues, according to the meaſure
of euerie ones faith, according to the diuerſitie of the
giftes of the holie Ghoſt, & according to the condition
of callings, that they all, & euerie of them liue and are
lead by one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit, and that they ſuccour
and maintaine one another in mutuall goodwill,
charitie, and loue.
                  Moreouer, this place alſo ſheweth vs the trimme,
handſome, and neate order of Chriſtes Church. For, ſuch
is the order of the Church, as of the members of one and
the ſame bodie, vnder one and the ſame head. Againe,
this preſent place teacheth vs, what manner of like-ſuffering
& conſent, or agréement, there ought to be among
Chriſtians one with another. For, as in one bodie, when
one member is pained and ſuffereth, the reſt of the members,
all and euerie of them, are partakers of that paine,
and ſuffer therewithall: euen ſo Chriſtians, who are
members of the ſame bodie, ought to be like minded one
towards another, that as well in aduerſitie, as in proſperitie,
one ſhould take part with another. To this



ſerueth the precept of S. Paule,
                     Rom. 12. 15. 
                     Gaudete, &c. Reioice
with them that reioice, & weepe with them that weepe.
                  
                  Finallie, and laſtlie, we muſt marke, that the Apoſtle
placeth (The edification of the bodie of Chriſt,) chiefelie
in (loue.) For, by (loue) the knowledge of Chriſt is
made fruitfull, and faith effectuall: yea, both of them are
made more notable and excellent. For, where (loue) is
not, there doubtleſſe the knowledge of Chriſt is but ſmall
and ſlender: as for faith, it is ſo little, that there is neuer
a whit. For, according to the meaſure of faith, (loue)
is more or leſſe.

                     17 This I ſaie therefore, and
teſtifie in the Lord, that yee
henceforth vvalke not as other
Gentiles vvalke in the vanitie of
their minde,
                     18 Hauing their cogitation
darkened, and beeing ſtraungers
from the life of God, thorough
the ignorance that is in
them, bicauſe of the hardneſſe
of their heart.
                     19 Which being paſt feeling,
haue giuen themſselues vnto
wantonneſſe, to vvorke all vncleanneſſe,
euen vvith greedineſſe.
                  
                  This I ſaie therefore and teſtifie
in the Lorde, that yee
walke no more as the reſt of
the Gentiles walk, in vanitie
of their minde, blinded in
their vnderſtanding, beeing
ſtraungers from the life of
God, through the ignorance
which is in them, bicauſe of
the hardnes of their hearts,
which being paſt repentance
(or ſorow) haue giuen themſelues
vnto wantonneſſe, to
commit all kinde of vncleanneſſe
with greedineſſe.
                  THe Apoſtle, vpon a generall ſentence or clauſe, frameth
particular exhortations. Firſt, his admonition
is to all, teaching vs from what kinde of manners wée
ſhould abſteine: to wit, from the maners of the Gentiles:
which he confirmeth from contrarie cauſes: and firſt,
from the beginnings of actions or cauſes. The beginnings
of actions in the vnholie & heatheniſh Gentiles, he maketh
to be of thrée ſorts: to wit, The vanitie of their mind,
the darkneſſe or blindnes of their vnderſtanding, & the
hardneſſe of their heart. The (Minde) is that, which the



Philoſophers call 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , to wit, when a man
by the light of reaſon, diſcerneth, perceiueth, and iudgeth
of things honeſt and diſhoneſt: but the Apoſtle auoucheth
that this (Minde) was vaine (Cogitation or vnderſtanding),
which in Gréeke is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , is that
naturall abilitie, whereby we deuiſe, determine, remember,
reaſon, and gather ſomewhat by and out of thoſe
things, which our minde quietlie ſéeth and perceiueth,
without debating or reaſoning: but the Apoſtle ſaith,
that this vnderſtanding was darkened or blinded: wherby
it came to paſſe, that the Gentiles béeing ignorant
of God, became eſtraunged (From the life of God.)
Now (The life of God) in this place is that, wherby God
liueth within, in the heart, and vpon the which, all abilitie
and deſire to doe anie good, dependeth.
                  Vnder the word (Heart) the Apoſtle compriſeth all the
luſts and appetites, attributing (Hardneſſe) vnto them:
whereof it commeth, that men are not touched with anie
ſparkle of the feare of God, but rather runne headlong
whether ſo euer their lewd luſtes, & filthie affections carrie
or driue them. Theſe are the beginnings and cauſes
of morall actions, or behauiours (touching religion) in
the Gentiles, which as yet are not turned vnto God.
                  But that theſe things maie ſomewhat the more plainlie
bée perceiued, we will inlarge and lighten the ſame
by examples. The (Minde) of man ſéeth that there is a
God, and iudgeth that he is to be worſhipped: which
iudgement, although it be true, yet notwithſtanding it is
héere accuſed of vanitie by the Apoſtle: and good reaſon
whie: euen becauſe it vaniſheth to nothing, and by the
corruption and naughtineſſe of nature is choked and
ſtrangled, before the matter commeth to action & practiſe.
                  For, when the (Vnderſtanding) reaſoneth out of this
beginning, principle, or ground, & yet ſtraieth from the
true God, & from the right waie of worſhipping him, the
(Minde) in deed ſéeth that there is both a God, and that



he alſo is to be worſhipped, but the (Vnderſtanding) in
the Babylonians reaſoneth that Bel, in the Aegyptians
that Apis, & ſo in other nations other idols are to be worſhipped:
& that one while by oblations of men, an other
while by other rites and ceremonies, the méere deuiſes of
men. And this is that which Saint Paule ſpeaketh of,
ſaieng,Rom. 1. 23 that The Gentiles turned the truth of God into
a lie, and worſhipped and ſerued the creature, forſaking
the Creator.
                  
                  Furthermore, the Apoſtle addeth the fit fruites of ſuch
cauſes: namelie, (Ignorance of God, eſtraunging from
the life of God, and hardneſſe of heart,) which is, ſenſleſſe
blockiſhneſſe, or numneſſe, not ſuffering them to
féele the greatneſſe and gréeuouſneſſe of their ſinnes, but
to growe paſt all remorſe of conſcience or repentance: ſo
that they ceaſſe vtterlie, and altogether leaue off to bée
ſorrie for their ſinnes. A certaine inclination to all (Wantonneſſe,)
followeth this ſenſleſſe duineſſe, or blockiſhneſſe:
yea rather, a certaine vnbrideled deſire to ſinne,
which the Apoſtle tearmeth heere by the name of (Wantonneſſe.)
This gréedie luſt burſteth out into all kinde
of villanies and abhominable miſbehauiours, which are
héere noted vnder the word (Vncleaneſſe,) all which are
increaſed & made more by (Greedineſſe,) the vtter aduerſarie
to contentation or temperance: vntill it throwe a
man downe headlong into the bottomleſſe gulfe of damnation.
For, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      is an vnmeaſurable luſt or deſire,
which hauing neuer inough, is alwais ſéeking to haue
more. In this place is firſt to be marked, what a wretched
creature man is, without the grace of regeneration, or
new birth, after the fall of our firſt parents: to wit (Vaine
of mind, blind of vnderſtanding, & hard in hart:) wherby
we may eaſilie perceiue, what manner of frée will that is,
which the Sophiſters & Schoolmen haue in ſuch count, & ſo
highlie praiſe, euen in ſuch as are not regenerate or new
borne. If therefore (according to the doctrine of S. Paule)



our intents, our procéedings, and our verie dooings are
faultie and ſinfull: what ſounde thing is remaining?
Tell mée that. And although the Apoſtle doth
not take from man his naturall abilities: yet notwithſtanding,
hée proueth that they were corrupt, after
his fall.
                  Moreouer, we haue héere to marke, that Saint Paule
ſpeaketh not of actions naturall, or ciuill, which are ruled
& gouerned by the mouing and geſture of the bodie. For
in theſe remaineth ſome libertie, in ſuch as are not yet
regenerate or borne a new: but he ſpeaketh onelie of
the actions which concerne Gods worſhip and ſeruice: of
which actions there are thrée cauſes. The firſt is, the
word, which inſtructeth the minde, and frameth the iudgment.
The ſecond is, the holie Ghoſt, which is effectuall
in the word, to the inlightening of the minde, and the inclination
or bending of the will. The third is, the will
of man reſting in the worde, and giuing place to the holie
Ghoſt, of whom it is both inſtructed and moued.

                     20 But ye haue not ſo learned
Chriſt:
                     21 If ſo be ye haue heard him,
and haue bene taught by him,
as the truth is in Ieſu.
                  
                  But ye haue not ſo learned
Chriſt, if ſo bee that yee haue
heard of him, and are taught
in him, euen as the truth is in
Ieſus.
                  THe Apoſtle ſheweth the cauſe whie the Epheſians
ought not, (as other hetherniſh Gentiles doe) to liue
in the ignorance of the Goſpell of Chriſt: to wit, bicauſe
they haue learned Chriſt. For, as a little before, he rehearſed
the cauſes of manie fowle ſinnes in the Gentiles,
which cauſes are theſe: namelie, (The vanitie of
their minde, the blindneſſe of their vnderſtanding, and
the hardneſſe of their heart:) ſo in this place he ſetteth
flatlie againſt all theſe, the knowledge of Chriſt aloue:



and further auoucheth, that the ſame is the cauſe of leading
a godlie and an honeſt life.
                  This knowledge therefore of Chriſt ought to bréed in
vs an other manner of liuing, than is in the Gentiles,
which are not yet (to this daie) turned vnto God, by and
through the preaching of the Goſpell. For, this effectuall
& forceable knowledge of Chriſt, what doth it? Forſooth,
it reformeth the minde, it inlighteneth the vnderſtanding,
and if ſofteneth the heart: to be ſhort, it reneweth
the whole man by the ſpirit of God, that now he beginneth
to liue (The life of God.) And this is that which
the Apoſtle ſaith, (As the truth is in Ieſus:) that is to
ſaie, the true waie to liue well, ſet foorth vnto vs in an
excellent and notable example. For, in Chriſt appeared
no kinde of marke or token of the olde man: becauſe
he bare the verie image of the Father, and béeing
full of the holie Ghoſt, obeied his Father in all things.
The word (Truth) therefore doth ſignifie, not onelie the
aſſent of trueth, but alſo the action which followeth
the aſſent: by the figure Synecdoche much vſed in Hebrew.
                  This place therefore is diligentlie to be marked,
which teacheth, that the knowledge of Chriſt, or of the
Goſpell, is but vaine: vnleſſe wée haue ioined therewithall,
ſuch manners as are worthie of Chriſt, and the
Goſpell. For the knowledge of the Goſpell, ſtandeth not
vpon a naked contemplation or gazing at things, not
in idle diſputations, &c: but in the ſingle knoweledge
of Chriſt, in faith, and in harmeleſſeneſſe of life:
or, as Saint Paule ſaith elſe-where, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
that is to ſaie, In knowledge and vnderſtanding.

                     22 That is, that ye caſt off, concerning
the conuerſation in



time paſt, the olde man, which
is corrupt, through the deceiuable
luſts,
                     23 And be renevved in the ſpirit
of your minde.
                     24 And put on the nevv man,
vvhich after God is created in
righteouſneſſe, and true holineſſe.
                  
                  That ye ſhould caſt off, (or laie

                        〈◊〉
                      from you) after the former
conuerſation, the olde
man, which is corrupt, thorough
the concupiſcenſes of
error: and ſhould be renewed
in the ſpirit of your minde,
and put on the new man,
which after God is ſhaped in
righteouſneſſe and holineſſe
of truth.
                  THe Apoſtle declareth, in a ſhort rehearſall, but yet
full and pithie, what it is, to haue learned Chriſt
trulie, what truth is in Ieſus, and what manner of life
the life of a Chriſtian ought to bée. Of this rehearſall
there are thrée partes: to wit, (To put off the olde
man, to be renewed in the ſpirit, and to put on the new
man.
                  
                  The firſt part therefore, is the putting off of the olde
man. The (Olde man) ſignifieth, not the ſubſtance, but
the qualitie: namelie, vice and corruption, & all cuſtome
of ſinning, according to the conuerſation of old. This cuſtome
of ſinning, S. Paule would haue all Chriſtians to
put off, that the rule and gouernement of the ſpirit might
be effectuall and full: of which thing he ſheweth the
cauſe (Which is corrupt through the concupiſcences of
errour,) that is to ſaie, whome deceiuable luſtes do corrupt,
whiles they drawe men into corruption and deſtruction.
                  
                     Whoſoeuer therefore deſireth to eſcape deſtruction
and vtter vndooing, let him put off the (Olde man). Now
the (Olde man) is then ſaid to be put off, when the bodie
of ſinne is weakened and brought vnder, that wée
ſhould ſerue ſinne no more. For ſo the Apoſtle expoundeth
his owne words, ſaieng, Hoc ſcientes, &c. Knowing
this,Rom. 6. 6. that our old man is crucified with him, that the bodie
of ſin might be deſtroied, that henceforth we ſhould
not ſerue ſinne. In this ſpeach of Saint Paule, the
word (Crucified) muſt be conſidered. For by that is ſignified



the efficacie and working of Chriſts croſſe, and this
death in vs, to the crucifieng and mortifieng of the (Olde
man.)Rom. 6. 12 13. 
                     To this ſerueth the exhortation of the Apoſtle, Neigitur,
&c. Let not ſinne therefore reigne in your mortall
bodie, that ye ſhould obeie it in the luſtes thereof:
neither giue you your members as weapons of vnrighteouſneſſe
vnto ſinne: but giue your ſelues vnto God, as
they that are aliue from the dead, and giue your members
as weapons of righteouſneſſe vnto God.Mat. 10. 38. 
                     This agreeth
alſo with the ſaieng of our Sauiour, Si quis vult, &c.
If anie man will come after me,Mat. 16. 24 let him denie himſelfe,
and take vp his croſſe dailie, and let him followe me.Mark. 8. 34.
                  
                  The ſecond part of the rule héere ſet downe is, (To
be rehewed in the ſpirit of our minde,)Luk. 9. 23. that is to ſaie,Luk. 14. 27 to
haue our minde made ſo bright and cléere with new light,
that the vanitie of our minde, and the blindneſſe of our
vnderſtanding béeing chaſed awaie, our inwarde man
maie taſte, ſauour, deſire, diſcerne, perceiue, vnderſtand,
thinke vpon, and reaſon of thoſe things which are of the
ſpirit.1. Cor. 2. 14. For, ſeeing The carnall or naturall man, perceiueth
not thoſe things that are of Gods ſpirit, it is behoouefull
that ſuch a renewing of the ſpirit bée wrought
in vs, as thereby we maie be able to ſubmit and bring
vnder our ſelues to the rule of the ſpirit.
                  The third part of the rule is (To put on the new man,
which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true
holineſſe.) Of this part there are thrée members. The
firſt is, to put on the new man by forſaking ſinne, and a
renewed ſpirit. The ſecond, the qualitie of the new man:
to wit, that he is (Created after God:) that is to ſaie, after
Gods image or likeneſſe. The third conteineth the things
wherin that newnes or likenes of God conſiſteth: namelie,
(Righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe,) with the former
whereof we ſerue men, according to the tenour of the
ſecond table: and with the latter wée worſhippe God
purelie and ſincerelie. The worde (True) ſtandeth



for a title due vnto holineſſe: (after the manner of the
Hebrew phraſe,) whereby is meant, that not a fained
or counterfaite (Righteouſneſſe), not an outward
(Holineſſe) onelie, but a perfect (Righteouſneſſe)
and an (Holineſſe) of hart, agréeing with the rule of Gods
will, is required. This place of Saint Paule is diligentlie
to be marked: not onelie, bicauſe it conteineth brieflie,
and in a verie trimme definition, the partes of a Chriſtian
life: but alſo, bicauſe it ſetteth foorth a cléere and
euident definition of (Gods image) in man. For, heerehence
we haue to vnderſtand, that (The image of God)
is a conformitie or agréeableneſſe of man with God (In
righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe). Héerevpon it came,
that our ancients or elders defined Chriſtianitie to be an
imitation or following of the diuine nature.

vnto his neighbour, for vvee
are members one of an other.
                  VVherefore caſting awaie
lies, ſpeake yee the truth,
euerie one to his neighbour,
bicauſe wee are members
one of an other.
                  NOw he gathereth the ſpecialties, which riſe of the
generalitie, or generall rule, concerning the putting
off of the olde man, and the putting on of the new:
beſides, he rehearſeth certaine members of either man,
for examples ſake. The firſt ſpecialtie is: following
(Truth) & plaine dealing: or ſingleneſſe and of (Lieng)
that is, of auoiding all manner of coulourable excuſes,
and doubleneſſe. The Apoſtle gathereth this ſpecialtie,
in this ſort: The olde man muſt bée put off, and
the new man muſt bée put on, who is created after God
in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe: Ergo (Truth) is to
bée followed as a member of the new man. As for (Lieng),
that muſt bée cut off, and caſt awaie as a member of



the olde man, to the ende we maie liue with our neghbours
vprightlie, plainlie, and neighbourlie.
                  To this ſpecialtie he addeth another reaſon drawne
from things iointlie knit together: (We are, ſaith, hée
members one of another,) Ergo we ought to ſuccour
and make much one of another, in (Truth) and honeſtie,
without all diſſembling and deceipt. After this ſort alſo
the reſt of the ſpecialties following are to bee ordered,
all which are continued in diſcourſe, by an Antitheſis or
oppoſition, euen to the end of the Chapter.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 26. 27.
                  
                  
                     26 Be angrie, but ſinne not:
let not the ſunne goe dovvne
vpon your vvrath.
                     27 Neither giue place to the
Diuell.
                  
                  Be angrie, and ſinne not: let
not the ſunne ſet vpon your anger,
and giue not place to the Diuell
(or backbiter.)
                  HE exhorteth vs, that we ſhould not be (Angrie.) But
becauſe it happeneth oftentimes, that euen the godlie
are moued, when things fall out amiſſe, and through the
weakneſſe of their owne nature: it commeth to paſſe,
that they can not be altogether frée from (Anger.)
Wherefore, the firſt thing that he doth, what is it? Euen
to ſet a ſtint, and to bound in our (Anger.) Secondlie, he
giueth vs counſell and aduiſe. Thirdlie, he addeth a reaſon
of his counſell. The ſtint of our (Anger) is, that we
ſhould not ſinne in being (Angrie:) which is done, ſo often
as we be (Angrie) either through our owne default,
or the default of others. But there is a kinde of praiſeworthie
(Anger,) which is kindeled either againſt our
owne ſinnes, to repent and be ſorie for them: or againſt
the ſinnes of others, to correct and puniſh them: and this
onelie (Anger) hath an eie to Gods glorie, and kéepeth a
certeine ſtint.
                  But, becauſe it falleth out ſo, that we can not bridle



our (Anger,) but through our owne follie it will drawe
to it ſome other ſin: the Apoſtle giueth vs counſell, (That
we ſhould not let the ſunne goe downe vpon our anger
or wrath:) that is to ſaie, that we ſhould not let the
ſinne of (Anger) reſt long in vs: but as it riſeth with
the ſunne, ſo to let it fall with the ſunne. This ſelfe ſame
meaning hath Pythagoras his poſie,Meaning ther by, that our anger muſt be no more perceiued than the print of a pots foot vvhen the imbers are raked abroad. 
                     Ollae veſtigium
cinere turbato, The print of a pots foote, when the aſſhes
be ſtirred. For if anger continue anie long time, it
commeth to paſſe, that the Diuell will enter into that
angrie mans heart, wholie to poſſeſſe it: ſo that by litle
and litle he ſhall be ſwallowed vp at length in the
gulfe of deſtruction. And this is the ſenſe of that which
the Apoſtle addeth, (Neither giue place to the Diuell.)
This place is diligentlie to be conſidered, which beareth
witneſſe, that the Diuell hath entraunce and roome made
him to dwell in the heart of man, (By anger and wrath.)
Séeing it is ſo, fie vpon it: and if we loue our ſelues, let
vs flie from (Anger and wrath,) as from the nette and
ſnare of Sathan.

                  28 Let him that ſtole, ſteale
no more: but let him rather labour
& vvorke vvith his hands
the thing vvhich is good, that
he maie haue to giue vnto him
that needeth.
                  Let him that did ſteale, ſteale no
more, but labour rather, working
that which is good with his hands,
that he maie haue to giue vnto
him that ſuffereth neede.
                  VNder the name of (ſtealth or theft,) the Apoſtle, by
the figure Synecdoche, vnderſtandeth all deuiſes and
waies whatſoeuer of deceiuing. And as he giueth counſell
to cut off this (Theft,) as a member of the olde
man: ſo he requireth diligent trauell, and earneſt labour
of euerie man in his vocation and calling, as a member
of the new man. He addeth the ende of this precept:
namelie, (That euerie one maie haue to giue vnto him



that needeth:) to wit, vnto them which either by ſickneſſe
or olde age being-hindered, are not able to get their liuing
with their hands. This place is to be marked againſt
théeues and pilferers, which liuing idelie, deuoure
the fruits of other mens labours.

proceede out of your
mouthes: but that vvhich is
good, to the vſe of edifieng,
that it maie miniſter grace vnto
the hearers.
                     30 And grieue not the holie
ſpirit of God, by vvhom ye are
ſealed vnto the daie of redemption.
                  
                  Let no filthy ſpeach come out of
your mouthes, but if anie doe,
let it be good & edifieng when
neede is, that it maie giue
grace to the hearers: and
grieue ye not the holie ſpirit of
God, by whom ye are ſealed vnto
the daie of redemption.
                  AS he exhorteth vs to cut off filthie ſpeaking and ribauldrie,
being one of the naſtieſt and fowleſt members
of the olde man: ſo he giueth vs counſell to vſe good
and honeſt talke, as neceſſarie for edification, béeing a
member of the new man: that in ſo doing it might (Miniſter
grace:) that is to ſaie, might turne to the profit and
commoditie of the hearers. For, vnder this word (Grace)
anie kinde of commoditie and profite whatſoeuer is in
this place to be vnderſtood.
                  Furthermore, to his exhortation he ioineth a ſubſtantiall
reaſon, ſaieng: (And grieue not the holie ſpirit of
God:) to wit, with your filthie talke. Now there is héere
to be marked a double figure. The firſt is called, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
whereby the affections and properties of man,
are applied vnto God. The ſecond is Metonymia. For,
(To grieue the ſpirit,) is to offend the ſpirit: yea, in
ſuch ſort to moue him, that he forſaketh man vtterlie,
in whom he tooke vp (as it were) his Inne. For, as
a gueſt béeing thruſt out of his Inne by violence,



feeleth himſelfe therewith greatlie grieued: euen ſo the
holie ſpirit is ſaid to be grieued, when he forſaketh the
heart of man, wherein he lodged before by faith: ſéeing
manie a fowle ſinne harboured in the ſame.
                  This exhortation of Saint Paule, if it take place among
them, which profeſſe the name of Chriſtians, there
would be fewer offenſes giuen by their life, and greater
quietneſſe among men. But lewd cuſtome, mens maliciouſneſſe,
the diuels temptations, and the wickedneſſe
of the fleſh, pull on the moſt part of men (the more pitie)
to the contrarie, and that not without great offenſe
to the Church, and the vndoubted deſtruction of manie.
                  The weapons therefore, wherewith we muſt fight againſt
this auncient lewd cuſtome, againſt mens maliciouſneſſe,
againſt the diuels temptations, and againſt the
wickedneſſe of the fleſh, are faith and praier. That
which the Apoſtle addeth, (By whom ye are ſealed vnto
the daie of redemption,) hath excéeding great weight in
it to exhort. For the holie ſpirit is an aſſured ſeale, and a
certeine marke, whereby the godlie and elect are diſcerned
from the wicked and reprobate, euen till the daie of
iudgement and redemption, when we ſhall be quit and
ſet free from all miſeries.

                     31 Let all bitterneſſe, and anger,

ſpeaking be put avvaie from
you, vvith all maliciouſneſſe.
                     32 Be ye courteous one to another,

for Chriſts ſake forgaue you.
                  
                  Let all bitterneſſe, & grudging,
& anger, & roaring, & blaſphemie,
(or curſed ſpeaking) be remoued

(or wickedneſſe.) And be
ye mercifull one to another, forgiuing
one another, euen as God
forgaue you in Chriſt.
                  HE perſuaded vs before to cut off anger, as a certeine
ill-fauoured and filthie member of the olde man:
now he willeth vs to pare awaie quite all the parts



thereof, as ioints of this member: and biddeth vs plant
in their places, the vertues which are contrarie to theſe
vices.
                  But becauſe the names of the vices, rehearſed héere,
are ſomewhat like in ſignification, they are therefore to
be diſcerned and knowne by their difference. (Bitterneſſe,)
which in Greeke is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , is the roote of
anger and grudging: this bréedeth grudging or indignation,
which in Greeke is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , being a certeine
furie or madneſſe of the minde thirſting after reuengement.
Indignation or grudging bréedeth wrath, which
burſteth out euen to the deede doing. This wrath, is the
mother of (Crieng or roaring,) that is to ſaie, of quarrellous
words, tending wholie to contention & ſtrife. (Crieng
or roaring) bringeth foth (blaſphemie, or curſed & euill
ſpeaking,) whereby one doth what he can to nicke anothers
name to raiſe vp an ill report vpon him, & ſo to ſéeke
his diſcredite & vndooing. The Apoſtles minde is, that
all theſe ſinnes and (Maliciouſneſſe) alſo with them,
be vtterlie put awaie: for theſe be the weapons, wherewith
men arme themſelues, to wound and hurt their
neighbours.
                  Moreouer, the Apoſtle ſetteth flat againſt theſe members
of the olde man, the members of the new man:
to wit, (Courteſie, mercifulneſſe, or tender heartedneſſe,
and forgiuing one another.) And to the ende he might
perſuade the Epheſians héerein, he bringeth the principall
paterne of all paternes: namelie (God the Father, who
for Chriſtes ſake forgaue vs.) All Chriſtians therefore,
as manie as couet like children to boaſt of ſo great a
Father, it behoueth them to applie themſelues to this
paterne. For, is it not a filthie thing, that children
ſhould not followe the vertues of their Father, ſo farre
as they maie?Luke. 6. 36 Héereto ſerueth the commandement of
Chriſt, Eſtote miſericordes, ſicut & Pater veſter coeleſtis
miſericors eſt: Be ye mercifull, as your heauenlie



Father alſo is mercifull. Saint Ambroſe frameth the
Apoſtles argument in this manner: Si Deus per filium
ſuum ſeruorum miſertus eſt, quanto magis ſerui
ipſi inuicem ſibi debent miſereri & donare, ſralter in
alterum peccet? In Engliſh thus: If God
for his ſonnes ſake, had compaſsion of
vs being but ſeruaunts: how much
more ought we being ſeruaunts,
to be pitifull, and forgiue
one another, if one
offend another.
                  
               
            
         
         
            
            ¶THE FIFT CHAPTER.
            
               ¶THE SVMME OF THE
fift Chapter.
               AS God the Father is to be followed in all holineſſe
and pureneſſe: euen ſo is mutuall loue and charitie
to be mainteined, after Chriſts example: to the ende
that all filthineſſe and vncleanneſſe being put to flight,
we ſhould liue holilie and honeſtlie. Furthermore, ſubiects
muſt be godlie diſpoſed among themſelues, and liue
Chriſtianlie one with another. And, as it becommeth
women to be obedient to their owne huſbands: euen ſo
on the other ſide, it is the dutie of huſbands to loue their
wiues, after the example of Chriſt, who loueth and tendereth
the Church his déere ſpouſe.
            
            
               ¶THE ORDER AND PARTS
of the fift Chapter.
               THe beginning of this fift Chapter, is concluded vpon
the laſt verſe of the fourth Chapter. For, as the Apoſtle
did there take an argument or reaſon of mutuall
goodwill and forgiuing one another, euen from the example
of our heauenlie Father: euen ſo héere in the beginning
of this fift Chapter, he fetteth downe another example
of the ſame Father, generallie to be folowed of all:
& he maketh a certeine ſouereigne or principall ground,
of the ſpecialties following. To this example he addeth
an exhortation to mutuall loue, taking his reaſon from
the example of Chriſt: from whence, (I meane from the
example of the Father and of Chriſt,) he is carried againe
to the ſpecialties, compared by ſetting contraries
againſt contraries: and he reckoneth vp diuers duties of
Chriſtians not a fewe, interlacing reaſons drawne from
the diuerſitie of our eſtate, being of two ſorts: namelie,
before the light of Chriſt was knowne, and vnder grace.



Laſtlie, he entereth againe into a generall exhortation
concerning mutuall ſubmiſſion, or dutifulneſſe, which
he diuideth ſtreight-waies into more ſpecialties, & handeleth
two of them at large in this Chapter. The firſt
whereof is touching the ſubmiſſion, which women ought
of dutie to ſhew and perfourme to their huſbands. The
ſecond concerning the dutie of huſbands, that they ſhuld
loue their wiues, euen as Chriſt loueth his Church.
            
            
               THE EXPOSITION OF THE FIFT
Chapter, with the obſeruation of the doctrines
therein conteined.
               
                  
                     Verſes. 1. 2.
                  
                  
                     1 Be ye therefore follovvers
of God, as deere children,
                     2 And vvalke in loue, euen
as Chriſt hath loued vs, & hath
giuen himſelfe for vs, to be an
offering, and a ſacrifice of a
ſweete ſmelling ſauour to God.
                  
                  Be ye therefore followers of
God, as beloued children, and
walke in loue, euen as Chriſt loued
vs, and gaue himſelfe for vs,
an oblation and ſacrifice of a good
ſweete ſauour vnto God.
                  
                     THe example of God ſet downe in the
end of the fourth Chapter in ſpeciall, I
applie in generall: to wit, that in all our
actions and doings: yea, in the whole
courſe of our life, we ſhould be (Followers
of God as deere children.) This
(Following) conſiſteth in true holineſſe, wherby the ſpirit
is kept pure and perfect, and the ſoule and bodie with
out complaint: that is to ſaie, it is framed to the rule of
Gods will, declared in his Lawe. Hereto ſerueth the ſaieng
of the Apoſtle,1. Theſs. 5. 23. 
                     Ipſe Deus pacis, &c. The verie God
of peace ſanctifie you throughout, that your whole ſpirit,
and ſoule, and bodie, maie be kept blameleſſe, vnto
the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                  
                  This is the (Following) which God requireth, when
he ſaith,Leu. 11. 44. 
                     Sancti eſtote, &c. Be ye holie, becauſe I the



Lord am holie,
                     Leuit. 19. 2 
                     and haue ſeparated you from other people,
                     Leuet. 20. 7. 8.
                     that ye ſhould be holie. After the ſame manner alſo
Chriſt ſetteth before vs the example of his Father to bée
followed,1. Pet. 1. 16. ſaieng, Eſtote vos perfecti, &c. Be yee perfect,
euen as your Father which is in heauen is perfect.
                     Mat. 5. 48 The
Lord in this place requireth not an equall perfectneſſe,
but a like perfectneſſe, according to the meaſure which is
in vs, till we are come to true perfectneſſe in déed, which
is ſignified by this word (Following.)
                  This place is diligentlie to be marked. For it teacheth,
that whoſoeuer will be in the number of Gods children,
they muſt followe the example of their heauenlie
Father, in all holineſſe and pureneſſe. They that neglect
this, and doe it not, wrongfullie take vnto themſelues
the name of children, ſeeing they are rather baſtards, than
lawfullie begotten. Héerevnto he addeth the example of
the Sonne, whereby hée exhorteth vs to loue one an other.
                  And that this preſent example might haue the more
weight, he ſheweth brieflie from the effect, how the loue
of the Sonne of God is towards vs: to wit, (Bicauſe hee
hath giuen himſelfe to be an offering & a ſacrifice vnto
God for vs:) that is to ſaie, a ſlaine ſacrifice, whereby
ſatiſfaction was made to God for our ſinnes, (Hauing a
ſweet ſmelling ſauour,) that is, with which onelie ſacrifice
God was delighted and well pleaſed. Now there is
to be marked in this place a double figure. Firſt, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
For the Apoſtle in this place (after the example
of Moſes) putteth vpon God the perſon of a man,
that he might frame himſelfe to our capacitie & knowledge.Gen. 8. 21.
For thus ſpeaketh Moſes, Oderatus eſt odorem
ſuauitatis, The Lord ſmelt a ſauour of ſweetneſſe. Secondlie,
Metalepſis, a figure in great vſe with the Hebricians.
For, by the ſwéete ſmelling ſauour is vnderſtoode,
a ſacrifice acceptable & pleaſing vnto God. The Author
of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, vſing a proper ſpeach,



whereby he expounding the phraſe of Moſes, ſaith: Talibus
hoſtijs,
                     Heb. 13. 16 
                     &c. With ſuch ſacrifices 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
God is onelie delighted or well pleaſed.
                  
                  This Argument of Chriſts loue towards vs, conteineth
in it thrée things. The firſt is, that the death of Chriſt
is the onelie price of our redemption. The ſecond, that
God performed all theſe things, vnderſerued on our part,
of his méere goodneſſe and loue. The third, that the thinking
vpon this excéeding great loue of Chriſt, ought rightwell
to put vs in minde of louing one an other. Wherefore,
if we will be partakers of Chriſt, let vs endeuour
our ſelues to loue one an other: ſpeciallie, ſéeing he himſelfe
ſaid thus, In hoc cognoſcent homines, &c. By 
                           〈◊〉
                        
ſhall all men knowe that ye are my diſciples,
                     Iohn. 13. 35 
                     if ye haue
loue one to an other, as I haue loued you.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 3.
                  
                  3 But fornication, and all vncleanneſſe,
or couetouſneſſe,
let it not bee once named among
you, as it becommeth
Saints.
                  But as for fornication, and all
vncleanneſſe, or couetouſneſſe,
let it not be once named among
you, as it becommeth
Saints.
                  THe Apoſtle beginneth to reckon vp ſuch ſinnes as
fight with the true following of God our heauenlie
Father, to wit, with holineſſe, which God will haue to
be the beautie and ornament of his children: and he ſetteth
downe thrée: namelie, (Fornication,) that is to ſaie,
a wandering fleſhlie luſt: (Vncleanneſſe) that is to ſaie,
all kinde of concupiſcence, wherewith the ſoule and the
bodie is defiled: (And couetouſneſſe,) which quencheth
and putteth out quite all hope & truſt in God, and nouriſheth
vp a wicked confidence in monie, as in an idole.
                  The Apoſtles minde and will is, to haue theſe vices
ſo wéeded vp, that they ſhould not be once named among
Chriſtians, much leſſe vſed. S. Paule ſeemeth to haue had



ancie vnto that place in Deuteronomie,
                     Deut. 23. 27, where it is ſaid,
Non ſit meretrix, &c. There ſhall be no whore of the
daughters of Iſrael, neither ſhall there be a whoore-keeper
of the ſonnes of Iſrael.
                  
                  But (alas) the wounds of the Church are iuſtlie to
be lamented. For theſe moſt filthie & noiſome plagues,
are not onelie wantonlie named, but alſo lawleſlie committed:
yea, euen of ſuch as brag and boaſt, that they
execute the iudgement of God. But it is the duetie of
the godlie to take héede, leaſt with the multitude of ſinners,
and their horrible offenſes, they fall into Sathans
net, and ſo either to blaſpheme and ſlaunder the word of
God, through the lewde behauiours and beaſtlie maners
of ſuch, as will be counted iollie fellowes in the Church
of God: or elſe to be allured by example to folowe their
filthie faſhions, which is done too ſoone (God wot) where
no héed is taken. For men do much ſooner followe the
vice of one, than the vertue of manie. Now, the reaſon
whie S. Paule would not haue theſe vices named, ſtandeth
vpon diſagréements. Chriſtians muſt be holie, Ergo
they ſhall not meddle with any thing that is beaſtlie and
abhominable.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 4.
                  
                  4 Neither filthineſſe, neither
fooliſh talking, neither ieaſting,
which are things not comlie:
but rather giuing of thanks.
                  And filthineſſe, and fooliſh talking,
and ribauldrie, (or beaſtlie
and vnhoneſt ieaſting) which
become not: but rather thankeſgiuing.
                  YEt againe the Apoſtle ioineth thrée vices together,
which doe likewiſe fall at defiaunce and open fight
with the following of God, & true holineſſe: againſt which
thrée vices, he ſetteth the vertue 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (Thankeſgiuing:)
a vertue in déed, which doth not onelie ſignifie a
praier wherein we giue God glorie, thanks, & praiſe: but
alſo language or ſpeach ſeaſoned with comlineſſe & ſwéetnes.
For God loueth not that Stoicall ſowrenes., & glummie
countenance whereby men are made afraid to be conſant



with vs: but as his will is to haue vs gentle and
ſwéet in our life and conuerſation one towardes an other,
ſo he requireth communication ſeaſoned with godlie
ſwéetneſſe.
                  Furthermore, where the Apoſtle interlaceth this,
(Which are things not comelie:) it is an argument
drawne from diſagréements. For all manner of filthineſſe,
ribauldrie, and diſhoneſt ieaſting, either in behauiour,
or in talke, is vtterlie at daggers drawing with the
dutie of a Chriſtian.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 5.
                  
                  5 For this ye knovve, that no
vvhooremonger, neither vncleane
perſon, nor couetous
perſon, vvhich is an idolater,
hath anie inheritaunce in the
kingdome of Chriſt, and of
God.
                  For this you knowe, that no
whooremonger, or vncleane, or
couetous perſon, or which is an
image worſhipper, (or idolater)
ſhall obtaine anie inheritaunce
in the kingdome of Chriſt, and
of God.
                  THe Apoſtle addeth vnto the wordes going before, a
verie heauie threatening: or a reaſon drawne from
the puniſhment which hangeth ouer the heades of
(Whooremongers, vncleane and couetous perſons:) to
wit, that they are ſhut out from the inheritance of Chriſt
and of God. And no meruell: for (wot you what) a iuſtifieng
faith can by no meanes ſtand or agrée with theſe
plagues. Neuertheleſſe, hope of pardon and forgiueneſſe
is not denied or withheld from the offender, by this threatening:
but the puniſhment due by deſert to ſuch fowle
ſinnes is onelie ſignified, that the filthineſſe of ſinne, béeing
once knowne, and the greatneſſe of our guiltineſſe
therein vnderſtoode by the puniſhments, we might fall to
repentance, and defie all ſuch filthineſſe.
                  For the rule of the Prophet, concerning the repentant,
as it is alwaies, ſo is it now to be laid faſt hold vppon:Ezech. 14. 15.
                     Cùm receſſerit, &c. When the wicked ſhall turne



from his ſinne, and doe that which is lawfull and right,
he ſhall ſurelie liue,
                     Ezech. 33. 11. 
                     and not die. Againe, Nolo mortem,
&c. I deſire not the death of the wicked, but that the
wicked turne from his waie, and liue. But ſpeciall héede
muſt be taken, that we abuſe not this rule to the diſhonour
of God, and our owne deſtruction. Let vs therfore
beware, that we runne not with full raine into a lewde
cuſtome of ſinning, leaſt God giue vs ouer into a reprobate
minde, and wée become careleſſe of our wicked
déedes, minding nothing leſſe than to bee ſorrie for
them.
                  For, if we ſet at naught the outcries of the holie Ghoſt,
ringing in our eares by the preaching of the Goſpell,
& calling vs to repentance: it is to be feared, that we ſhall
be quite caſt awaie by Gods iuſt iudgement, and counted
dead creatures, and damned ſoules, ordeined to eternall
torments, before God. Which puniſhment doubtleſſe is
moſt worthie, that God therewith ſhould take vengeance
vpon the malapert vntowardneſſe, ſawcineſſe, and péeuiſhneſſe
of men.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 6. &. 7.
                  
                  
                     6 Let no man deceiue you
vvith vaine words: for, for ſuch
things commeth the vvrath of
God vpon the children of diſobedience.
                     7 Be not therefore companions
vvith them.
                  
                  Let no man deceiue you with
vaine ſpeches. For by ſuch things
commeth the wrath of God, vpon
the children of diſobedience.
Bee yee not therefore
made partakers with them.
                  IN theſe words the Apoſtle vſeth the figure Prolepſis,
which in Engliſh maie be called a Preſumption,
whereby he catcheth their obiection & excuſe by the head,
which diminiſh and leſſen the ſinnes aboue rehearſed,
ſaieng, that they are but eſcapes and defaults following
mans frailtie & weakneſſe: and that God is not ſo cruell
a tyrant, that for ſuch offenſes he will quite caſt men awaie:



Moreouer, that there were diuerſe: yea, euen of
the moſt holie Fathers, in all ages and times, which fell
in the like: againe, that grace ſo aboundeth, as it ſwalloweth
vp the ſinnes of the whole world: and finallie,
that it is inough, if a man be brought to the repentaunce
of his ſinnes committed, when he is going out of this
world, and giuing vp the ghoſt.
                  With theſe and ſuch like reaſons, manie doe miſerablie
deserue themſelues, vntill they tumble downe headlong
into euerlaſting deſtruction. But yet our Apoſtle
doth admoniſh the godlie in this place, that they ſuffer
not themſelues to be deceiued, inſnared, and tangled with
(Vaine words), whereby as with a hooke Sathan draweth
them into hell. There is no poiſon more dangerous,
than are thoſe excuſes & delaies, which kéepe, embolden, &
harden vs in our ſinnes. For, whoſoeuer liſteneth vnto
ſuch (Vaine words,) & is in liking with them, ſaie what
ye will, he is vtterlie voide of the feare of God. For, this
is proper to the feare of God, (as the ſonne of Syrach
ſaith,) euen to driue out and chaſe awaie ſinne.
                  I ſaie therefore, that we muſt flee from the ſpéeches
of ſuch heatheniſh & vnholie men, not as from the ſwéete
and entiſing ſongs of Syrens, but as from the deadlie
ſtings and wounds of Sathan. For, theſe men turne the
iudgement of God, and the rebuking of ſinnes, into toies
and merriments. Let vs rather be moued with the examples
of the whole world, which for ſuch ſinnes ſake, felt
the heauie wrath of God, that is to ſaie, the vengeance
of God falling vpon (The children of diſobedience:) that
is to ſaie, vpon ſtubburne and wilfull men.
                  The floud is a witneſſe héereof, the burning vp of Sodom
maketh it a cléere caſe, verie manie ouerthrows, and
horrible changes of diuerſe kingdomes, Commonwelths,
and honourable houſes auouch it for a truth. And that it
is no lie, the torments of the wicked, wherwith God will
puniſh their ſtifneckedneſſe and neglect of dutie, ſhall bée



a ſufficent triall. Let vs therfore obeie the holie ſpirit, exhorting
& commanding vs (That we ſhould not be companions
with them:) & let vs earneſtlie & in time fall to
repentance of our former life, leaſt the Lord in his furie
moſt iuſtlie caſt vs off, and giue vs ouer into a reprobate
minde, till we growe paſt grace & be vtterlie void of anie
féeling of ſorowe for our ſinnes. Let not the multitude of
miſliuing ſinners moue vs, let not lawleſnes be a cloke to
couer our ſhame, let not ſcaping ſcot frée, when we haue
done amiſſe, deceiue vs. The puniſhment is not forgiuen
or forgotten, though for a time it be forborne and driuen
off. Let vs not therefore ſet light by Gods gentleneſſe,
and long ſuffering, dailie calling vs to amendement.

                  8 For ye vvere once darkneſſe,
but are novv light in the Lord:
walke as children of light.
                  For ye were ſometimes darkneſſe,
but are now light in the Lord, as
children of light ſo walke.
                  HE fetcheth the reaſon of hisexh ortation, from a compariſon
of the Epheſians double eſtate: to wit, of that
wherein they were before their conuerſion: and of this
wherein they are now placed after their conuerſion. For
it is méete, that euerie one ſhould anſwere in life & manners,
the degrée and place wherein he is ſet: and ſhould
alſo take héed that he ſtaine not his eſtate with anie ſpot,
leaſt through his owne follie and fault, he fall from that
dignitie, whereto he was aduaunced, both to his owne
ſhame and reproch, and alſo to the ruine and decaie of others,
which by their example are the worſe.
                  The Apoſtle in this place calleth men that are blinded
in their ſinnes, & liue altogether diſorderedlie & villanouſlie,
by the tearme of (Darkneſſe:) ſuch are all they,
(manie, or few,) which are not yet conuerted or turned
by the Goſpell. Now, this figure Metonymi
                           •
                        ,
hath in it great force, as when we call a wicked man,
wickedneſſe it ſelfe. The meaning therefore is this.
                  Before your conuerſion, (O yée Epheſians,)



what were ye? Euen men made of the méere darkneſſe
of ignorance and maliciouſneſſe: ſo that there was not
one mite of true and healthfull light remaining in you.
But now you are light, walke therefore as children of
light. The word (Light) is attributed and giuen to the
faithfull: both bicauſe they are inlightened in themſelues
with true light: and alſo, bicauſe they giue more light,
and ſhine brighter than others: inſomuch that they doe euen
reproue and finde fault with the life of the wicked:
that is to ſaie, make the ſame more manifeſt.
                  This place is principallie to be marked, which admoniſheth
vs, that the thinking vpon the dignitie and worthineſſe
of Chriſtians, ought to be a pricke vnto them,
to ſtirre them vp to liue holilie and vnblameablie: both
that we ſhould performe to God ward all due obedience,
and alſo drawe others forward by our example to godlineſſe.
Beſides that, this place teacheth vs, that ſuch as
profeſſe themſelues to be Chriſtians, and yet liue wickedlie,
deceiue themſelues, and laie themſelues wide open to
greater danger of damnation. For they are not the (Children
of light), that is to ſaie, they are not inlightened
with the true light, vnleſſe they defie and forſake the

We which beléeue, are regenerate or new borne, and

                     11 And haue no fellowſhip
vvith the vnfruitfull workes of
darkneſſe, but euen reproue
them rather.
                  
                  Allowing that whereby the
Lord is well pleaſed, and haue
nothing to doe (or meddle not)
with vnfruitfull (or vnprofitable)
workes, but rather rebuke
them.
                  THe Apoſtle declareth, what it is (To walke as children
of light,) and he draweth the endeuours or ſtudies
of the children of light, as it were to thrée heads.
For his will is firſt, that we ſhould ſearch out and approue
whatſoeuer is acceptable vnto God: that is to ſaie,
whatſoeuer is commanded and ſet downe in his word.
For, as the word of God alone inſtructeth and teacheth
vs, what pleaſeth him, and what diſpleaſeth him: ſo
this word alone ought to be the rule of life vnto the
godlie.
                  Secondlie, the Apoſtle requireth vs (Not to haue
anie fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull) that is to ſaie, vnprofitable
& hurtfull (works of darkneſſe:) to wit, which
procéed from the ignorance of the Goſpell, & of Chriſt,
and which haue in them as their cauſe, concupiſcence ingendered:
ſuch are the heatheniſh and horrible ſinnes,
wherewith they that are ignoraunt of the Goſpell, defile
and ſtaine themſelues▪ Now, we are ſaid then to haue
fellowſhip with heinous and great diſordered ſinnes, both
when we either make proofe anie manner of waie, one
or other, that they pleaſe vs, or when we ouerſlip them
with ſilence, and that moſt of all, if our calling otherwiſe
ſéeme to charge vs, that we ought openlie to profeſſe our
ſelues diſpleaſed with them.
                  Thirdlie, that we ſhould rebuke the workes of darkneſſe,
and that as well by our holie and honeſt life, as alſo



by liuelie voice, ſpringing from a certeine zeale of the
glorie of God: and thus muſt we chieflie doe, if it ſtand
with the order of our vocation and calling. But, if we
maie not doe it in words: yet notwithſtanding, wée
muſt ſhewe one waie or other, that theſe ſinnes and
offenſes like vs not in anie caſe, but altogether irke
and loath vs.
                  This place is to be marked. For the Apoſtle doeth
not compriſe in a ſhort Aphoriſme, the duties of the children
of light: to wit, of Chriſtians onelie: but alſo diſproueth
and throweth vnder foote the vanitie of them,
that giue a geſſe, (as the blinde man ſhootes his bolt,)
that they doe their duties to the vttermoſt, if they ſinne
not themſelues in their owne perſon, being neuer a whit
carefull for others. Moreouer, the Apoſtle teacheth in
this place, that they alſo are out of the waie, and twang
vpon a wrong ſtring, who though they liue in blind Poperie,
thinke notwithſtanding that it is enough to abhorre
vngodlineſſe, and defie papiſticall ſuperſtition in
minde and thought, ſuppoſing that to be preſent at the
abhominable,Becauſe that in beeing buiſie thereabouts, they pilfer and ſteale frō God, part of his honour and ſeruice. théeuiſh, and heatheniſh deuotions of Papiſts,
for outward peace and quietneſſe ſake, is nothing
hurtfull. For they, which either by their preſence ſéeme
to allowe theſe trumperies, although in minde they
miſlike them much: yet notwithſtanding, they put
the halter of wicked fellowſhippe about their owne
neckes.
                  And what doe they? They vnderſtand not, that it
makes no matter, whether they doe it of blinde ſuperſtition,
or of craftie and cloſe diſſimulation: ſeeing that
by either euill, as well this, 
                        〈◊〉
                      that, men make a mocke
of Gods holie religion, and by their example, partlie confirme
and embolden the ignoraunce of the blunter ſort
in more obſtinate ſtubborneſſe: and partlie inféeble and
ſhake the doubtfull and wauering conſciences of weaklings.2. Reg. 5. 18.
As for Naaman the Gouernour of Syria, hée



makes verie litle or nothing on their ſide, who at ſuch
time as he aſked God forgiueneſſe of one thing: to wit,
if he entered into the temple of Rimmon with his Lord
and King, and worſhipped there: the Prophet let him
goe in peace. For that worſhipping was not a falling
downe before idols: but a certeine ſtooping and bending
forward of his bodie, that the King might the
more eaſtlie leane vpon him, as he ſtaied and bare
him vp. That this is ſo, the hiſtorie it ſelfe plainlie
proueth.

                     12 For it is ſhame, euen to
ſpeake of the things which are
done of them in ſecret.
                     13 But all things, vvhen they
are reproued of the light, are
manifeſt: for it is light that
maketh all things manifeſt.
                     14 Wherefore he ſaith, Avvake
thou that ſleepeſt, and
ſtand vp from the dead, and
Chriſt ſhall giue thee light.
                  
                  For it is filthie to tell what
things are done priuilie of thē:
but all things, whiles they are
rebuked of the light, are made
manifest. For whatſoeuer maketh
manifest, the ſame is
light. VVherefore he ſaith, Ariſe
thou that ſleepest, & ſtand
vp from the dead, and Chriſt
ſhall giue thee light.
                  THe Apoſtle maketh the ſinnes and offenſes of the
heatheniſh Gentiles the more grieuous, and ſheweth
therewithall the fruite of rebuking and reprouing:
whereby the godlie, through their honeſt and holie life,
may rebuke the vncleanneſſe and wickedneſſe of the vngodlie.
For, by ſuch kindes of rebuking, wicked men
come to the knowledge of themſelues: and when they
take a view of the manners of the godlie, they confeſſe
their owne beaſtlineſſe: and ſo at length beginne to bée
aſhamed of the filthineſſe of their faultes and vices.
This is the meaning of this part or parcell of doctrine.
                  
                     
But, becauſe the words of the Apoſtle haue neede to
be erpounded, we will ſaie ſomewhat, that the weight of
his words maie be marked. For firſt of all, when he
ſaith, (It is ſhame euen to ſpeake of the things which
are done of them in ſecret,) it is a making of the matter
worſe, by laieng two euill things together. It is
leſſe to ſpeake of offenſes and faults, than to commit or
doe them: now, if ſo be it is ſhame, euen to ſpeake or
talke of ſuch miſdéeds as they haue done, trulie then the
doing of a filthie déede is moſt of all to be defied and ſpet
at. Anon after, when he ſaith, (All things, when they
are reproued of the light, are manifeſt,) he declareth the
fruite of brotherlie rebuking or chiding one another.
                  
                     The ſenſe or meaning of the words is this, as Saint
Ambroſe doth expound them, Then doe wicked men
and offenders appeare, and are ſeene in their colours,
when they are taken vp for their faults: becauſe he
which offendeth, ſo long as he is not rebuked, hee ſeemeth
in his owne eies not to offend at all. Now they
are made manifeſt by the light, becauſe the children of
God, who are called, The children of light, rebuke them
by their life, their doctrine, & wholſom admoniſhments.
The proofe of this ſpeach followeth, euen frō the nature
of light. (Light, ſaith the Apoſtle, maketh all things
manifeſt.) For, as darkneſſe ſhadoweth and couereth all
things, and maketh them ſecreat and hidden: ſo the
light bringeth that out into open ſight, and bright noone
tide, which laie lurking and ſhroonke vp in darkneſſe.
                  
                  To this alſo he addeth another compariſon drawne
from authoritie of Scripture: (Awake, ſaith he, thou
that ſleepeſt:) that is to ſaie, thou that ſnorteſt in thy
ſinnes, forſake thy ſinnes, and (Ariſe from the dead:)
that is to ſaie, abſteine from ſinnes which bring death
with them. (And Chriſt ſhall giue thee light:) that is to
ſaie, thou ſhalt féele conſolation by the ſpirit of Chriſt.
For how much more we ſlie from the darkneſſe of



ſinnes, ſo much more ſhall Chriſt the ſunne of righteouſneſſe
ſhine in our hearts. Saint Hierome denieth that
this ſaieng is anie where to be found in the Scriptures.
Some there be, which thinke that the Apoſtle had an
eie to that place of the Prophet, where it is ſpoken thus,
Surge, illuminare, &c. Ariſe, be bright: for thy light
is come,
                     Eſai. 60. 1 
                     and the glorie of the Lord is riſen vpon thee.
Other ſome referre it vnto an other place, becauſe it
ſhould not ſeeme to be vnwarranted, where it is ſaid
thus, Populus qui ambulat, &c. The people that walked
in darkneſſe haue ſeene a great light:
                     Eſai. 9. 2. 
                     they that
dwelled in the land of the ſhadowe of death, vpon
them hath the light ſhined.
                  
                  Other ſome ſuppoſe that it is ſpoken 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , by
waie of imitation. For, all the Prophets and ſincere
preachers of Gods word, whiles they doe their endeuour
to call men backe from ſinne, doe vſe theſe or ſuch
like words in effect. For, firſt of all, they exhort men (as
indéede it is meete) to repentaunce and amendement.
Secondlie, they ioine therevnto the word of promiſe,
and conſolation alſo, whereby the repentaunt are raiſed
vp and comforted. To conclude therefore, let vs all
learne, that the ſpirit of Chriſt ſpeaketh vnto euerie one
of vs, and ſaith: (Surge qui dormis, &c. Awake thou
that ſleepeſt, and ſtand vp from the dead, and Chriſt
ſhall giue thee light.)
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 15. 16. & 17.
                  
                  
                     15 Take heede therefore that
ye vvalke circumſpectlie, not as
fooles, but as vviſe,
                     16 Redeeming the time, for
the daies are euill.
                     17 Wherefore be ye not vnvviſe,
but vnderſtaud vvhat the
vvill of the Lord is.
                  
                  See therefore that ye walke
warilie, not as vnwiſe, but
as wiſe, redeeming the time,
becauſe the daies are euill.
VVherefore, be ye not vnwiſe,
but vnderſtand what the
Lords will is.
                  
                     
THat which the Apoſtle ſpake metaphoricallie before,
vnder the names of light and darkneſſe, now hee expreſſeth
in proper and familiar ſpeach. (Take heede
therefore, ſaith he, that ye walke circumſpectlie, not as
fooles:) that is to ſaie, ignoraunt of Chriſt and of the
Goſpell: (But as wiſe:) that is to ſaie, taught the trueth
of God, and knowing the will of God. He addeth a reaſon
of his exhortation drawne from the circumſtance of
the time: (Redeeming the time, ſaith he, sor the daies
are euill.) Now, what (Redeeming the time) doth meane,
we ſhall ſoone vnderſtand by laieng the contraries
together. To let the time paſſe, by hauing ſome vaine
matter in hand: and, To redéeme the time, are contraries.
As that therefore, is the tricke of a negligent and
looſe fellowe: ſo is this the point of a thriftie and wiſe
man, who doth not onelie, not abuſe time, but alſo redéemeth
the ſame, with a thouſand honeſt recreations.
                  The Metaphore is borrowed of merchants or occupiers,
who are verie buiſie about their mart, and make
more accompt of ſome ſmall gaine, than they doe of all
fond delights▪ and then chiefelie, when the times bée
troubleſome, and the daies daungerous: as when hunger,
or ſcarſitie increaſeth, or when they haue to deale
with craftie yonkers, or when their ware is dead, and
ſéemeth to lie vpon their hands at hap hazard, or otherwiſe
to hang vpon doubtfull fortune. For then merchants
and occupiers buiſilie beſtirre them, and doe all
things circumſpectlie, watching (I warrant you) for opportunitie
in their affaires.
                  Séeing therfore we are ſaid to redéeme the time, when
wée prouide againſt the loſſe of ſuch things as we loue
in this world: let vs (for ſhame) take the true opportunitie,
and fit time of ſaluation, offered vnto vs by the Goſpell.
For that ſhalbe the price of our redemption, if wée
renounce all entiſements and impediments, which maie
withdrawe and kéepe vs backe from the kingdome of



Chriſt: and by all manner of meanes waite and watch
with broad waking eies for the occaſion, or due time of
repairing our ſaluation. And why? Euen becauſe the
daies are euill.
                  He ſaith that (The daies are euill,) not in reſpect of
the ſpaces of houres, and courſe of the ſunne: but in
conſideration of the corrupt manners of the world. For
the figure Metony
                           ••
                        a is heere vnderſtood, whereby
time is taken for the thing done in time. By theſe
words he bringeth in that which he ſet downe before in
other words, and ſaith: (Wherefore be ye not vnwiſe,
but vnderſtand what the will of the Lord is:) as if the
Apoſtle ſhould ſaie, Forſomuch as ſo great daungers doe
incompaſſe the godlie round about on all ſides, it is
behouefull, that ye take diligent heede of the maliciouſneſſe,
and corrupt manners of the world, leaſt ye
ſuffer your ſelues through fooliſhneſſe to be withdrawne
from the right waie: but ye muſt rather regard this,
that the will of God be alwaies before your eies, and
in your minde, which ought to be the continuall rule
of your race, throughout your whole life, and in
all your dooings. The Apoſtle declareth by an Antitheſis,
or oppoſition, whome hée calleth (Vnwiſe.)
For hee ſetteth flatte againſt them, (Such as vnderſtand
what the will of God is.) They therefore, by
proofe of this place, ſhalbe (Vnwiſe,) which liue careleſſelie,
litle thinking vpon framing and ordering their
life according to the will of God.
                  Furthermore, this place of Saint Paule is
worthie to bée alwaies in our ſight. For it giueth
vs warning, that wée ſhould not ſuffer our ſelues
to bée throwne headlong into all ſorts of ſinnes, after
the example of the multitude: from which ſinnes,
wée muſt altogether and vtterlie abſtaine, if wee
will bée godlie indeede: and wee muſt endeuour our
ſelues to doe the will of God, albeit we renounce and



forſake euerie thing that pleaſeth the fleſh. Héere let
each one of vs eramine and proue himſelfe, taking héede
therewithall, that we caſt not at our tailes too ſawcilie
and ſcornfullie, this wholſome exhortation of the holie
Ghoſt, making much of the alluring pleaſures of the
fleſh, and other things, which are of force to turne our
hearts from the deſire of true godlineſſe.

hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongs,
ſinging and making melodie
in your heart to the Lord, giuing
thankes alwaies for all
things, in the name of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                  THe Apoſtle (for example ſake,) ioineth vnto his generall
exhortation, certeine ſpecialties: and he commendeth
vnto vs in the firſt place ſpirituall reioicing,
perſuading vs from fleſhlie reioicing or carnall gladneſſe.
For, as ſpirituall reioicing as a certeine ſpirituall
wiſedome: ſo fleſhlie or carnall reioicing, which is dronkenneſſe,
is a kinde of fooliſhneſſe. As therefore he giueth
vs counſell to leaue this: ſo his aduſe is, to take
the other: the argument, which he vſeth in this caſe, is
drawne from the effect of either of both, and that by

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , demonſtration. For, there is a reaſon
framed orderlie againſt either of both, as in manie like
things before hath bene done. (Be not dronke with wine)
ſaith the Apoſtle: that is to ſaie, Take not occaſion by
ouer drinking your ſelues, to be merie & reioice. Why ſo?



Bicauſe therein conſiſteth ſottiſhneſſe: that is to ſaie,
all kinde of wantonneſſe, lewdneſſe, filthineſſe, and intemperance.
For, dronkenneſſe cauſeth a man to runne
headlong into all manner of miſdemeanour, & to commit
much miſchiefe, according to theſe verſes, not ſo olde as
true: Quid non ebrietas, &c.
                  
                  
                     What doth not dronkenneſſe deale with all?
                     To blab our ſecrets comes from thence:
                     It biddes be bolde: and greeu'd at gall,
                     Inforceth fight where is no fence.
                  
                  
                     Cicero in his ſecond booke De finibus, declareth who
they bée, that are called ſots, his words are theſe: Noli
mihi, &c. Tell not me, as ye are wont, of ſuch ſots as ſpue
at the table, and are faine to be carried awaie from bankets,
and hauing ſurfetted, goe againe afterwards, and
cramme themſelues full like Capons. This therefore
doth not onelie offend God moſt gréeuouſlie, and put out
the light of the holie ſpirit in our heart: but alſo eſtrangeth
and beſtraughteth the mind, diſcloſeth ſecrets, kindleth
luſt, weakeneth the bodie, breedeth verie manie diſeaſes
of minde and bodie: of which thing the whole world
almoſt is a witneſſe.
                  Againſt this the Apoſtle ſetteth (The fulneſſe of the
ſpirit,) that is to ſaie, ioie in the holie ſpirit, whereby we
burſt out into godlie ſpeaches, concerning God and heauenlie
things, into (Pſalmes, hymnes, ſpirituall ſongs, &
thankſgiuings,) vnto almightie God our bountifull Father,
who giueth all things abundantlie to his children,
for his ſonnes ſake Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. For, therefore
he ioineth (God) and (Father) together in this place,
not that they are two, but one God: whoſe great power
doubtleſſe, is ſignified by the name of (God:) and his
good will noted, vnder the true name of (Father.)
                  Moreouer, the difference betwéene (Pſalmes, hymnes,
and ſongs,) is this. They are (Pſalmes,) in ſinging whereof



Muſicians vſe ſome manner of inſtrument, beſides the
tongue (Hymnes) conſiſt in praiſes, ſounded either with
the tongue alone, or ſome other waie. (Songs) are vttered
with the voice, and belong not onelie to praiſes▪ but
alſo to oth
                        •
                     r things, as propheſies, doctrines, erhortations,
&c. Now, Saint Paules meaning is, to haue all theie (Spiri
                        •
                     uall)
that is to ſaie, not idle, fooliſh, and wanton: but
tending wholie to edification. For this word (Spirituall,)
put to, ought to be referred vnto the argument and end.
As for the words of S. Paule which followe, they are not
at ſqua
                        •
                     e with theſe things, (Speaking vnto your ſelues:)
againe, (Singing and making melodie in your hearts:)
For the phraſe of Scripture, (Speaking to your ſelues,)
is as much as, betweene or among your ſelues: & (Singing
in your hearts,) as much as, from your heartes. The
Apoſtle cannot awaie with wanton ſongs, and vaine pipings,
twangings, whiſtlings, and ſuch like, wherewith
the conſcience is neuer a whit edified: but the conſcience
by them is rather troubled, godlie praiers
hindered, deuotions ſlackened, and the heate of ſeruing
God quenched. The ſongs which he requireth are
ſuch onelie, as proceeding from a pure and cleane heart,
bring ſpirituall gladneſſe and reioiſing to godlie Chriſtians.
                  This place of the Apoſtle therefore doth teach, in what
things the reioiſings of the godlie doe conſiſt: to wit,
in ſpeaking one to an other of God, and heauenlie matters,
and in godlie ſongs, whereby our hearts are ſtirred
vp to greater faith and confidence.
                  Furthermore, although dronkenneſſe is to bée defied,
and fled from, as a moſt noiſome plague or peſtilence:
yet notwithſtanding, honeſt and ſober meetings of Chriſtians,
to make merrie and banket together, are not to
be condemned. For, theſe maie bée certeine prouokements

                  21 Submitting your ſelues
one to an other in the feare of
God.
                  Submit your ſelues one to an
other in the feare of Chriſt.
                  HEtherto the Apoſtle hath reaſoned of common duties
of Chriſtians: taking in hand now to commend vnto
the Epheſians the ſundrie duties of ſeuerall perſons, he
ſetteth downe firſt of all a generall rule or precept concerning
ſubmiſſion one to an other: and therevpon afterwards
bringeth in certeine degrées and particularities
touching the ſame matter. Moreouer, in this generalitie
two things are diligentlie to be marked: to wit,
the precept, and the rule, or tho reaſon of the rule. The
precept is this, (Submitting your ſelues one to an other.)
This precept perteineth to all men, of all ſtates
and degrées whatſoeuer. For, there is none, but ought
of dutie to doe good vnto others, and to ſerue them in
loue and charitie So kings and princes ſerue their ſubiects.
For, whereſoeuer truth poſſeſſeth the minde, there
is alſo preſent a readie will to ſhew all kinde of ſeruice,
and obeiſance.
                  The rule of ſubmiſſion one to an other, is (The feare
of Chriſt.) This (Feare) is nothing elſe, but the ſeruice of
faith and ſubmiſſion. This (Feare) taketh awaie quite
all arrogancie, whereby men, as it were ouerlooking
one an other from aloft, deſpiſe each other. This
(Feare) bringeth to paſſe, that wée denieng our
ſelues, forſake all things, which Chriſt cannot abide
to be in his. To bée ſhort, this (Feare) worketh
in vs, that we, after Chriſtes example, ſerue all
men, that by our obedience God might be glorified,



and that we might be knit one to an other in all duties
of loue and charitie. This rule of ſubmiſſion therefore,
ought to be laid vp in ſtore, euen in the ſecreteſt place of
our hearts. For, whoſoeuer doth not followe this rule,
in performing Chriſtian duties, he maie traiterouſlie vſurpe
and take vpon him, the name of Chriſt, but as
for the rule of the ſpirit of Chriſt, and the gratious gouernement
hereof, he hath malapertlie ſhaken it off.

                     22 Wiues, ſubmit your ſelues
vnto your huſbandes, as vnto
the Lord:
                     23 For the huſband is the
wiues head, euen as Chriſt is
the head of the Church, & the
ſame is the ſauiour of his bodie.
                     24 Therefore, as the Church is
in ſubiection to Chriſt, euen ſo
let the vviues be to their huſbands
in euerie thing.
                  
                  VViues be yee ſubiect to
your owne huſbandes, as to the
Lord, becauſe the huſband is
the wiues head, euen as Chriſt
is the head of the Church, &
he is the ſauiour of the bodie.
But as the Church is ſubiect
vnto Chriſt, euen ſo let wiues
be to their owne huſbands, in all
thinges.
                  THE Apoſtle laid before vs a generall doctrine of ſubmiſſion
one to an other: now he taketh examples
from domeſticall or houſholde eſtate, and ſheweth in order
the mutuall dueties of wiues and huſbandes, of children
and parents, of ſeruants and Maiſters: and he handleth
in the firſt place, the duties of wiues towards their
huſbands. He confirmeth his propoſition by compariſon,
and ſheweth the manner of ſubiection or ſubmiſſion.
                  The propoſition ſtandeth vpon compariſon, in this
ſort:Gen. 3. 16. (Wiues ſubmit your ſelues vnto your husbands,
as vnto the Lord.) This lawe of obedience is laid vpon
the woman, becauſe ſhe ſuffered hir ſelfe to be deceiued of
the ſerpent. And although in the firſt ſtate of man, the



wife was made ſubiect to the huſband: yet notwithſtanding,
that ſubiection differed from the other, which
was afterwards laid vpon the woman. For the firſt ſubiection
was, as it were frée and not hard a whit: but
the ſecond ſubiection brought with it a heauie yoke,
which kept hir vnder, and this was the puniſhment of
hir ſinne. But this yoke is made pleaſant, rather than
gréeuous, to godlie women, when they looke vpon the
Lords will, for whoſe ſake they owe ſubiection to their
huſbands.
                  The Apoſtle addeth a reaſon to his propoſition, which
reaſon riſeth from the ordinance of God, and from that
which is profitable. (Becauſe the huſband is the wiues
head,) ſaith Saint Paule: that is to ſaie, not onelie the
higher, as the head in the bodie: but alſo, as the head giueth
power & ableneſſe to the bodie, whereby the health of
the bodie is mainteined: ſo the huſband ought to haue a
regard to the welfare of his wife. That this was the
meaning of S. Paule, by this word (Head,) the compariſon
following doth declare. (As Chriſt is the head of the
Church, and the ſame is the ſauiour of his bodie.) Now,
Chriſt is the (Head) of the Church, both becauſe he alone
is chiefe gouernour thereof, and alſo bicauſe that whatſoſoeuer
good thing the Church hath, it procéedeth from
Chriſt hir (Head:) as we haue declared in the ſecond
Chapter.
                  Now followeth the manner of ſubiection. (Therefore
as the Church is in ſubiection to Chriſt, euen ſo let the
wiues be to their husbands, in euerie thing.) This (Subiection)
therfore ought to be frée, voluntarie, willing, readie,
chéerefull, pleaſant, dutifull, chaſt, honeſt, godlie, and ſo
foorth. And although Chriſt and the huſband, are not equall
in authoritie: yet notwithſtanding, huſbands haue
rule ouer their (Wiues), after the example of Chriſt, and
repreſent a certaine image of the Lorde Chriſt in his
Church.
                  
                     
The firſt is, that wiues which are diſobedient and
ſtubburne againſt their huſbandes, are ſo farre from
béeing obedient vnto Chriſt, that they intangle and
winde themſelues in Sathans nettes and ſnares.
                  The ſecond is, that wiues maie receiue great profit
by godlie obedience and ſubiection: euen as the bodie,
which cleaueth vnto the head, borroweth and
taketh from thence all his liuelineſſe and abilitie.
                  The third is, that wiues muſt be content with their
owne huſbands, whom they muſt endeuour, to the vttermoſt
of their might, to pleaſe, with all godlie dutie, and
honeſt ſeruice.
                  The fourth is, that the ſubiection of wiues, is not
onelie to be allowed, for domeſticall or houſholde profits
ſake: but alſo bicauſe it is a ſeruice pleaſing God,
when it iſſueth and commeth from true faith and
loue.
                  The fift is, that the errour of the olde heretikes is
héere ouerthrowne, who eſtéemed and tooke marriage for
a prophane and vnholie thing, and after a ſort vnworthie
for Chriſtians. But the holie Ghoſt in this place
is of a farre contrarie minde, who compareth honeſt
marriage, to the coupling of Chriſt and his Church.
Heere let vs note well that ſaieng in the Epiſtle to the
Hebrewes,Heb. 13. 4. a ſaieng deſeruing due memorie: Honorabile
inter omnes, &c, Marriage is honourable among all,
and the bed vndefiled: but whooremongers and adulterers,
God will iudge.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 25.
                  
                  25 Husbands, loue your wiues,
euen as Chriſt loued the
Church, and gaue himſelfe for
it.
                  Huſbandes loue your wiues,
euen as Chriſt loued the
Church, and gaue himſelfe for
the ſame.
                  
                     
THis is the ſecond example or ſpecialtie of the
generaltie alreadie paſt, and conteineth thrée
thinges: to wit, the precept, the cauſe, or the reaſon,
and the manner of loue. The precept is, (Husbandes,
loue your wiues.) The cauſe or reaſon is, (Euen
as Chriſt loued the Church.) The manner is expreſſed
by example, (And gaue himſelfe for it.)
Héerehence doth appeare the greatneſſe of Chriſtes
loue. If therefore huſbandes will rule ouer their
wiues, after the example of Chriſt: let them then
learne and knowe, that they are warned by his example,
to declare their loue by their déedes, if occasion
ſo require: euen as Chriſt did, whiles he ſought
and bought the life and ſaluation of his Church,
with his owne death.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 26. &. 27.
                  
                  
                     26 That he might ſanctifie
it, and cleanſe it by the vvaſhing
of vvater, through the
vvord:
                     27 That he might make it vnto
himſelfe, a glorious Church,
not hauing ſpot, or wrinkle,
or anie ſuch thing: but that it
ſhould be holie and vvithout
blame.
                  
                  That he might make her holie,
cleanſing her with the
waſhing of water, in the
word, that he might make
her vnto himſelfe a glorious
Church, not hauing blemiſh
or wrinkle, or anie ſuch
thing, but that ſhe ſhould be
holie and blameleſſe.
                  THE Apoſtle hauing taken occaſion by the example
of Chriſt, louing his Church, and giuing himſelfe
for it, maketh a fitte enteraunce into the commendation
of the grace of Chriſt towardes his Church, according
to the order of ſuch benefites, as Chriſt of
his méere grace, beſtowed vpon his Church. For,
firſt of all, hee loued the Church. Secondlie,



for that loues ſake he gaue himſelfe for hir. Thirdlie, he
ſanctified his Church: that is to ſaie, he ſeuereth and taketh
hir apart to himſelfe, and maketh hir holie vnto
God, through the forgiueneſſe of finnes, and the ſpirit of
regeneration, or new birth. Fourthlie, the Apoſtle addeth
the manner how Chriſt ſanctified his Church, ſaieng:
(Cleanſing it by the waſhing of water throgh the word.)
Fiftlie, the end of the ſanctification of the Church is ſet
downe: to wit, That the Church might be faire & beautifull,
without ſpot or wrinkle, deckt and garniſhed with
holineſſe and vnblameableneſſe.
                  But the fourth and the fift degrée, doe néede a larger
expoſition. For, they conteine diuerſe and manifold doctrines.
When the Apoſtle therefore ſaith, (Cleanſing it
by the waſhing of water through the word, ) he moſt
liuelie ſetteth foorth the force of the ſacrament of Baptiſme.
For, if we ſhall as it were vnfolde and laie open
theſe wordes, we ſhall ſée fiue thinges in Baptiſme
méete and worthie of marking. The firſt is, Chriſt cleanſing
vs.1. Ioh. 3. 8 For, to Chriſt alone this honour doth agrée and
belong, Who appeared to this end, that he might deſtroie
the works of the diuell, and take awaie ſinne. Héereto
ſerueth the ſaieng of S. Iohn: Sanguis Ieſu, &c. The
bloud of Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God,
                     Heb. 9. 14. 
                     cleanſeth vs
from all ſinne.
                     1. Pet. 1. 18 19. The second is, (The waſhing of water,)
which is the outward ſigne of grace,1. Ioh. 1. 7. and the ſeale of our
inward cleanſing.Reuel. 1. 5. The third is, the truth anſwering vnto
the ſigne, which is to be conſidered: this is a ſecret
cleanſing of our ſoules, and an inward waſhing awaie of
our ſinnes. The fourth is, (The word) that the force and
vertue of Baptiſme maie be vnderſtoode by the worde of
promiſe. The fift is, the analogie or proportion of the
ſigne to the truth: which analogie or proportion is diligentlie
to be conſidered in euerie ſacrament. The ſigne
is, The waſhing of water: the analogie or proportion is,
As water cleanſeth the bodie without: ſo the bloude of



Christ waſheth awaie the filth of ſinne from the ſoule
within. This analogie or proportion the Apoſtle ſignifieth
vnto vs, under this word (Cleanſing.)
                  Theſe things throughlie conſidered, and rightlie
weighed: it is eaſie to knowe, in what accompt the ſacraments
of the Church ought to be. For, they are
ſignes, ſeales, & tokens, whereby God offereth his grace:
and giueth euidence, that he will indéed perfourme that,
which the outward things themſelues do repreſent. For,
the truth of the thing vnséene, is alwaies ioined with the
ſacraments ſéene: and ſo is the giuing it ſelfe, which is
throughlie done by the ſecret working of the holie ghoſt.
Not that the holie Ghoſt ſtandeth in neede of anie outward
helpe, but there is conſideration had of our
weakneſſe.
                  Out of these things it is eaſie to gather, that a ſacrament
is rightlie defined in the new Teſtament, to bée
a ſigne ſéene and fealt, ordeined euen of Chriſt himſelfe,
to ſeale the word of grace and promiſe, which is to be receiued
by faith. And although the wicked are neither
waſhed with Baptiſme, nor nouriſhed by the Lords ſupper:
yet notwithſtanding, the ſacraments kéepe their
force and vertue, in reſpect of God: becauſe howſoeuer
the vnthankfull will none of it, Gods grace is offered
vnto them neuertheleſſe.
                  Furthermore, the deſcription of the Church, which
followeth, doth not belong to outward ſhewe and faſhion,
but to the inward cleanneſſe of the heart. This is
rightlie to be vnderſtood, becauſe of them which denie
that there is a Church, where anie ſuch are aſſembled,
as beare about with them, anie manner of ſpot, blemiſh,
or ſtaine whatſoeuer. To the boulſtering vp of which
errour of theirs, they wreſt this place of Saint Paule:
If (ſaie they) the Church haue no spot, and no wrinkle:
if the Church be holie and without blame:Epheſ. 5. 26. 27. then ſhall
not this aſſemblie, where ſo manie miſliuers are met



together be the Church.
                  
                     This errour is diſprooued, by the order of praieng,
which the Lord left vs for a paterne. For we are bidden
to praie thus,
                     Mat. 6. 12. Remitte nobis debita, &c. Forgiue
vs our treſpaſſes. And in the Pſalme it is ſaid, Pro iniquitate,
&c.Pſal. 32. 5. 6. For the remiſsion of ſinnes, euerie holie &
godlie one ſhall praie vnto thee. If therefore all the holie
ones, (commonlie called Saints,) haue néede to
praie dailie for the remiſſion of ſinnes, they ſhall not
then be altogether frée from euerie ſpotte. And Saint
Iohn ſaith,
                     1. Iohn. 1. 8. 9. Si dixerimus, &c. If that we ſaie we haue
no ſinne, we deceiue our ſelues, and truth is not in vs.
If we acknowledge our ſinnes, he is faithfull and iuſt,
to forgiue vs our ſinnes, and to cleanſe vs from all vnrighteouſneſſe.
                  The Apoſtle doth not therefore meane, that the
Church is alreadie cleanſed, and void of all blemiſhes or
freckles: but rather, that ſhe groweth vp dailie, and continuallie
profiteth, directing her courſe wholie thither,
whither ſhe will neuer be able to come, whiles this
world laſteth. For, ſo long as the Church abideth in this
world, ſhe is ſtained and ſpotted two waies. For, firſt of
all, there is no member of hers ſo pure and perfect, but
is attainted with diuers ſinnes and vices. All the
faithfull therefore,Rom. 7. 16. 17. 18. 19 20. 21. 22. &c. for the time of their tarrieng heere,
haue alwaies ſome vncleanneſſe, which remaineth in
their fleſh, as plainlie is proued, by the experience of the
Saints, or holie ones.
                  Furthermore, Hypocrites and fowle offenders, who
with their filthineſſe infect the whole Congregation, are
alwaies mingled with the good and godlie in the Church:
as Saint Paule manifeſtlie teacheth, writing to the Corinthians.
For, he adorneth and beautifieth the Corinthians,
with the title of the Church: howbeit, there
were among them manie high-minded, manie defiled
with things offered vp vnto idols, ſome that had ill



names for committing inceſt: verie manie vſed the Lords
holie ſupper vnreuerentlie, not a few which called the
riſing againe of the dead in doubt: as euidentlie appeareth
in the Epiſtles. The Lord alſo himſelfe ouerthroweth
this, by the parable of the darnell.
                  Whereto then ſerueth that ſtatelie and loftie ſpeach
of the Apoſtle, calling the Church of Chriſt his ſpouſe,
(Not hauing ſpotte or wrinkle, holie, and without
blame?) I aunſwere: the Church is to bée conſidered after
two ſorts: to wit, in her ſelfe, and in Chriſt. As
the Church is conſidered in her ſelfe, ſhe hath manie
ſpottes doubtleſſe, wherewith ſhée is blemiſhed: which
notwithſtanding are not imputed and laide to her
charge, whiles the ſpirit hath the vpper hand in her.
But as ſhée is conſidered in Chriſt, ſhée is not onelie
without ſpotte, but alſo excéeding gorgeouslie garniſhed:
to wit, with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,
which ſhée hath obteined by frée gift. Saint Auguſtine
maketh a difference betwéene the ſtate of
the Church in this life, and in the life to come. In
this life preſent, the Church hath her ſpots. In the life
to come ſhe ſhall be without all ſpot, pure, holie, and
without blame in verie deede.
                  
                  This place of the Apoſtle teacheth, comforteth,
and diſprooueth. It teacheth, to what ende wée are
waſhed with holie Baptiſme: namelie, that wée
ſhould endeuour our ſelues to bée pure and cleane.
It comforteth them which grone vnder the burden
of their ſinnes, and lament that they are ouerladen
with them. For the time will come, when their
full cleanſing ſhall bee. To this perteineth the complaint
of the Apoſtle, and his comfort by and by
following:Rom. 7. 24. 25. 
                     Infoelix homo, quis me eripiet ex hoc
corpore morits, &c. O wretched man that I am:
who ſhall deliuer mee from the bodie of this death?
I thanke God through Ieſus Christ our Lord.
                  
                  
                     
It diſproueth them, which brag and boaſt of Baptiſme,
and in the meane time lead an vncleane life, flatlie withſtanding
the analogie or proportion of Baptiſme, which
putteth vs in minde of continuall repentaunce.
                  Héere maie that be alledged, which Siant Paule
alledged against the Iewes of his time, Circumciſio
quidem prodeſt,
                     Rom. 2. 25 
                     &c. Circumciſion verelie is profitable,
if thou doe the Lawe: but if thou be a tranſgreſſour
of the Lawe, thy circumciſion is made vncircumciſion.
Euen after the same manner we maie procéede againſt
them, which are Chriſtians onelie in name: saieng,
Baptiſmus quidem prodeſt, &c. Baptiſme verelie is
profitable, if thou do the lawe of Baptiſme, that is to ſay,
if thou kéepe the couenant of Baptiſme: but if thou be a
tranſgreſſour thereof, thy Baptiſme doth thée no good.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 28.
                  
                  28 So ought men to loue their
vviues, as their ovvne bodies.
                  So ought men to loue their
wiues euen as their owne bodies.
                  THe Apoſtle yet more manifeſtlie declareth and ſheweth
the manner of louing our wiues: hauing an eie to
the firſt couple that euer were married, euen Adam and
Eue. When Adams wife was brought vnto him, he
ſaid: Hoc nunc os de oſsibus meis, & caro de carne mea:
This now is bone of my bones,
                     Gen. 2. 23. 
                     and fleſh of my fleſh.
And therefore of Adams ribbe, the Lord made the woman:
that thereby he might repreſent his Church: and
alſo ſhew, of what minde huſbands and wiues ought to
be, either to other in holie matrimonie. For, the huſband
and the wife are (as it were) one and the ſelfe ſame fleſh:
that is to ſaie, one and the ſelfe ſame bodie. Vpon this
ground Saint Paule buildeth this reaſon: (No man euer
yet hated his owne fleſh:) but the wife is one fleſh,
or one bodie, with her huſband: Ergo, huſbands ought



to loue their owne wiues, as their owne fleſh and bodies.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 28. 29. 30. 31.
                  
                  
                     28 He that loueth his vvife,
loueth himſelfe.
                     29 For no man euer yet hated
his ovvne fleſh, but nouriſheth
and cheriſheth it, euen as the
Lord doeth the Church.
                     30 For we are members of his
bodie, of his fleſh, and of his
bones.
                     31 For this cauſe ſhall a man
leaue father and mother, and
ſhall cleaue to his vvife, & they
tvvaine ſhall be one fleſh.
                  
                  He that loueth his wife,
loueth himſelfe. For no man
euer yet hath hated his
owne fleſh, but nouriſhed
and cheriſhed the ſame, euen
as the Lord doth the church,
becauſe we are members of
his bodie, of his fleſh, and
of his bones. For this things
ſake, ſhall a man forſake father
and mother, and ſhall
ſticke by his wife, and theſe
two ſhall be one fleſh.
                  THe Apoſtle defendeth and proueth that we muſt loue
our wiues, and ſetteth downe in the firſt place, two
ariomes, principles, or grounds, which are the propoſitions
of two ſyllogiſmes. Afterwards he addeth other
two arguments: the firſt whereof is fetcht from the example
of Chriſt, the ſecond from the ordinance of God.
Theſe latter arguments are added, to confirme the former.
The firſt ſyllogiſme is this, being made vpon the
firſt principle: (He that loueth his wife, loueth his owne
ſelfe:) But euerie huſband loueth his owne ſelfe: Ergo,
he ought to loue his wife. The ſecond ſyllogiſme riſeth
out of the ſecond principle, in this wiſe: (No man
euer yet hated his owne fleſh, but nouriſheth and cherriſheth
it:) but the wife is the fleſh of her owne huſband:
Ergo, the huſband ought not to hate his wife, but
rather to nouriſh and cherriſh her. To this he ioineth an
argument drawne from example: (Becauſe ſhe is fleſh
of his fleſh, & bone of his bones.) This he proueth and
defendeth by authoritie out of Geneſis, ſaieng: (For this
cauſe ſhall a man leaue his father and his mother,
                     Gen. 2. 24 
                     and
ſhall cleaue to his wife, and they ſhall bee two in one



fleſh. As if he ſhould ſaie. A man were better forſake
his father and his mother, though he be bound vnto them
by the lawes of nature: than to leaue his wife, with
whom he is one fleſh, ſo long as the ſubſtaunce of matrimonie
remaineth ſafe and ſound. For if adulterie
creepe in betwéene, the guiltie partie is cut off from that
vnitie or oneneſſe of the fleſh, which the Lord requireth
in honeſt matrimonie. Now, the huſband and the wife
are ſaid to be (One fleſh,) not in ſubſtaunce, but in affection
and loue. For, the huſband ſhall loue his wife and
cherrish her, euen as his owne fleſh: the wife in like
caſe ſhall loue her huſband as her owne fleſh. The huſband
and the wife therefore are one, out of which vnion
or oneneſſe,Matth. 19. 3. 4. 5. 6. &c. Chriſt maketh his aunſwere to the queſtion
concerning diuorcements.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 32.
                  
                  32 This is a great ſecreat, but
I ſpeake concerning Chriſt, and
concerning the Church.
                  This myſterie is great, but
I talke as touching Chriſt, and
the Church.
                  THis is an admonition or aduertiſement. For, the Apoſtle
could not ſufficientlie vtter in words, what a
wonderfull liuelie image of the coupling of Chriſt and
the Church, marriage, is which God ordeined in Paradiſe.
And although marriage be an outward thing: yet
notwithſtanding, the Apoſtle auoucheth, that it was a
certeine figure of Chriſt the Bridegroome, and of
the Church the Bride. For, as the woman was taken
out of the ſide of the man, as he laie a ſléepe: euen ſo the
Church groweth vp by the power and vertue of Chriſts
death. And as ſhe forſaking father and mother, cleaueth
vnto her owne huſbande, and holdeth her ſelfe content
with him alone, like an honeſt wife: euen ſo the Church
forſaking idolatrous fornication, ſhall cleaue vnto her
onelie Bridegroome Chriſt Ieſus, and ſhall rather leaue
her most ſwéete and tender parents, than depart from



Chriſt her huſband.
                  Furthermore, as Eue was created and made out of
Adams ſide: that is to ſaie, out of the middeſt of his bodie:
euen ſo the Church ſpringeth out of the fleſh and
bones of Chriſt, which indéed hath a secret ſignification,
and is myſticallie meant. For, there is a certeineThe latine copie hath Anagogia, vvhich cannot ſtand with the ſenſe of this place, as the learned doe knovve. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
or proportion, of the thing ſeene, to that which is
ſpirituall, and not ſéene: wherevpon S. Paule calleth it,
(A myſterie or ſecret:) that is to ſaie, a ſacrament. For
marriage leadeth vs after a ſort, by the thing ſeene, to a
thinking vpon the inward coupling together of Chriſt &
the Church, which marriage firſt repreſented. And this
is Saint Paules meaning, when he ſaith: (But I ſpeake
concerning Chriſt, and concerning the Church:) as if
he ſhould ſaie, The marriage of the man and the woman,
was ordeined of God in Paradiſe, not onelie for
the helping one of another, & for the begetting of children:
but alſo, that the ſame ſhould be a certeine ſigne of the
coupling together of Chriſt and the Church: ſo that vnder
things ſéene, a ſpirituall matter is repreſented as it were
by liuelie image. Wherfore ye definition of (Myſterium,
a Myſterie or ſecret,) in great vſe among the Gréekes,
maie fitlie be applied héerevnto. For the Gréeke diuines
doe make this definition of (Myſterium, a Myſterie)
That it is a viſible action or déed doing, hauing ioined vnto
it a certeine ſpirituall contemplation or meaning. And
although this definition doth generallie agrée to the Sacraments
of the Church of Chriſt: yet notwithſtanding,
the reaſon is farre otherwiſe of Sacraments, ſo called

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , for their excellencie. For, they were onelie
ordeined and appointed of Chriſt, to be certeine ceremonies
& tokens of the inuiſible grace, which the Goſpell
offereth: of which ſort there are onelie two in the new
teſtament: namelie, Baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper.
                  Moreouer, as the Papiſts haue wickedlie wreſted
this place, to proue, that matrimonie is to be reckoned in



the number of the ſacraments of the new Teſtament:
ſo they truu to a weake foundation, which thinke that
the Papiſts are ſufficientlie diſproued héereby: becauſe
(forſooth) the Gréekes write it a myſterie, & not a ſacrament:
when indéed theſe two words do as much differ in
generall ſignification, as (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) and (Candidum,) both
which words doe ſignifie (White.) For, that which the
Gréeke Diuines haue called (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) the Latines call
(Sacramentum:) which is all one. Wherefore, as our
aunceſtours thought, that matrimonie was rightlie called
of Paule, a myſterie, or ſacrament: ſo it is not to be
doubted, but they harpe vpon a wrong ſtring, which
reckon matrimonie for a ſacrament of the new Teſtament.
Becauſe it is neither a proper ceremonie of the
new Teſtament, neither doth it aſſure ſufficientlie of it
ſelfe, the promiſe of the grace of the Goſpell, neither is
it a token or badge belonging to the Church alone: but
it is a ſtate and degrée of life common to all mankinde.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 33.
                  
                  33 Therefore, euerie one of
you, doe yee ſo: let euerie one
loue his wife, euen as himſelfe:
and let the vvife ſee that ſhee
feare her huſband.
                  Let euerie one of you therefore
loue his wife as his owne ſelfe,
and let the wife feare her huſband.
                  LEaſt anie ſhould thinke, that holie matrimonie is but
a bare badge or ſigne onelie: and that therefore, the
words which haue bene alreadie ſpoken, concerning the
compariſon of Chriſt with the Church, to be referred to
the marriage of our firſt parents alone: the Apoſtle outreaching
them that thus might ſuppoſe, applieth the example
vnto all generallie: and ſhutteth vp in a short
ſumme, ſuch things as hée handeled, touching
the
duties of married couples, one to another. And
as hée draweth the duties of the huſband towards



the wife, vnto one head or ſpring of loue: ſo hée affirmeth,
that the dutie of the wife is, to feare and reuerence
her huſband, as her head.
                  Vnder this word (Feare,) all duties of the wife,
to the huſband are conteined. The huſband, which loueth
his wife vnfeinedlie, imbraceth, tendereth, and maketh as
much of her, euen from his heart roote, as he doth of his
owne ribbe: that is to ſaie, as S. Paule ſpeaketh héere,
as his owne ſelfe: that is, as his owne fleſh. For the
Apoſtle painteth out before vs this manner of loue:
therefore he thinketh well of it, he ſpeaketh honeſtlie of
it, his aduiſe and endeuour is not lacking to further it: finallie,
he beſtoweth all duties of courteſie, humanitie,
and gentleneſſe vpon it: yea, as he would doe to himſelfe,
ſo doth he vnto it, according to the lawe of God, and
the ordinance of nature.
                  The dutie which ſhall anſwere on the other ſide vnto
this loue, is conteined in this word (Feare,) wherby the
reuerend ſeruice and dutifulneſſe is vnderſtood, with the
which the wife béeing the inferiour or lower, ſerueth
hir huſband being the ſuperiour or higher, & ſheweth vnto
him all duties of subiection belonging vnto him. Shée
murmureth not againſt her huſband, ſhe ſwelleth not at
him, ſhee ſets not ſhoulder againſt him, ſhée ſéekes not
to be head and ruler ouer the whole houſe: but performeth
all manner of duties and ſeruices to her huſbande,
with a godlie loue, honeſt affection, and Chriſtian tenderneſſe.
                  This ſubiection, when it procéedeth from faith and
the feare of God, it is the trimmeſt ornament, and the
faireſt furniture that an honeſt woman can haue. This
place therefore teacheth vs, thatThat is, the regiment of the people, vvhen all rule lieth in their hands, not allovving anie gouernour, but themſelues. Democracie, or ſéeking
to be all alike in rule, is in a manner againſt nature.
For the rule of the huſband ouer the wife, in the houſe,
doth ſhew the forme and order of Ariſtocracie, or the
verie beſt and vprighteſt kinde of gouernment that is.

Chapter.
               CHildren and parents, ſeruaunts and maiſters, muſt
diſcharge ſuch dueties one to an other, as belong to
their calling. All muſt arme themſelues with the furniture
and weapons of the ſpirit, to withſtand the kingdome
of Sathan. Praie yée for all men, and for mée,

you.
            
            
               THE ORDER AND PARTES OF
the ſixt Chapter.
               AS hée treated of the duties of married folkes, one to
an other, in the end of the fift Chapter: ſo he ſetteth
downe the duties of children and parents, of ſeruaunts
and maiſters, in the beginning of this ſixt Chapter. Afterwards,
the Apoſtle commeth backe to a generall exhortation,
aduiſing the Epheſians to furniſh themſelues
with ſpirituall armour, againſt ſpirituall enimies, of
whom he maketh a ſhort deſcription, and laieth out the
ſpirituall armour, péece by péece, as it is to be put on.
Moreouer, the Apoſtle deſireth them to praie for him, and
certifieth them, that he ſent Tychicus vnto them, to comfort
them. Laſtlie, he ſhutteth vp his Epiſtle, after his
woonted manner, with bleſſing & welwiſhing vnto them.
            
            
               ¶THE EXPOSITION OF THE SIXT
Chapter, with the obſeruations of the doctrines
therein conteined.
               
                  
                     Verſe. 1.
                  
                  1 Children, obeie your parents
in the Lord.
                  Children obeie your parents in
the Lord.
                  
                     
                     THis is the third ſpecialtie: to wit, obedience
of children towardes their parents,
wherin we méet with two things
to be marked. The firſt is, that vnder
this word (Obedience,) the holie ſcripture
compriſeth honour, whereof obedience
is a moſt aſſured token: by the figure Synecdoche,
commonlie in vſe. This honour hangeth vpon two
points: namelie, in affection, and in effect. The honour
which ſtandeth vpon affection, is true godlineſſe towards
our parents, true loue, and feruent good-will likewiſe,
wherewith we make much of them, and dutifullie
behaue our ſelues towards them, bicauſe they are our
parents.
                  The effect of honour due to our parents is, to be fullie
perſuaded in minde and conſcience, that their eſtate
is in déede a diuine order and degrée appointed by God:
& for that cauſe to bée had in eſtimation and account. Let
children therefore, euen willinglie, ſtand in awe of their
parents, ſubmit themſelues vnto them, obeie them in all
things that are honeſt and lawfull, let them ſhew themſelues
thankfull, gentle, dooing them good in word and
in déed, couering the faults of their elders with méekeneſſe,
or at leaſt wiſe making the beſt of that which is
amiſſe.
                  The ſecond thing, which I ſaid was to be marked in
this place, is: that this obedience ought to be performed,
(In Domino, In the Lord:) which putteth children
in minde of two verie great things. The firſt is,
To obeie for the Lords ſake, or for his commandements
ſake, and that faithfullie, or in faith. Héereto
ſerueth that ſaieng of Ieſus the ſonne of Syrach, Qui
timet, &c. He that feareth God, honoureth his parents.
The ſecond is, To knowe that a meaſure of obedience is
appointed them: leaſt they ſhould obeie their parents
in things which withſtand the Lordes will. For, if parents



ſhall take in hand anie ſuch thing, let children
learne and knowe, that the lawe of their parents after
the fleſh, laid vpon them in that ſort, is quite diſplaced by
the commandement of a higher gouernour, euen their
heauenlie Father.
                  
                     If parents therefore inioine and charge their children
to doe anie thing, either againſt religion, or againſt honeſtie,
or to the hurt of their common countrie: the children
owe no obedience at all vnto their parents in this
caſe: yea rather, let them ſet themſelues flatlie face to face
& fiſt to fiſt againſt them, prouided alwaies, that they paſſe
not beyond the bounds of godlineſſe. To this belongeth
that notable ſaieng of Auſonius: Parentibus, &c. Then
doth a child obeie his father & his mother, when hee or
ſhe doth that of their owne will & accord, which they
are rightlie & well commanded to do. With this alſo agréeth
that ſaieng of our Lord,
                     Mat. 10. 37. Si quis vult, &c. If anie
will come to me, & hateth not his father & his mother,
he cannot be my diſciple.Luk. 14. 26 
                     Our parents therfore are to be
loued, but yet our Creator is to be preferred. Heerevpon
S. Ambroſe ſaith: Si officium, &c. If dutie is not to be
denied, but to be diſcharged towards our parents: how
much more then to the maker, cauſer, & procurer of our
parents: namelie, God, whom thou art bound to praiſe &
thanke for thy parents? And the ſame S. Ambroſe ſaith:
Vt paſ
                        •
                     endos, &c. As the Scripture commandeth vs to
feed and cheriſh our parents: ſo it biddeth vs giue them
ouer and forſake them, if they ſhall bee hinderers of a
deſire and diſpoſition to holineſſe and deuotion.
                  The hate therefore which Chriſt teacheth vs to beare
towards our parents, is but a diſſembled hate, or a hate in
ſhew: whereby we ſeeming deafe and hard of hearing,
regard not, but lightlie paſſe by the ſwéete ſugred ſongs
of Syrens: that is to ſaie, of our parents, dooing what
they can, with the balmed baites of this world to vndoe
vs, and to drowne vs in the waues of wickedneſſe: but



we ought not to giue them the hearing, much leſſe the doing.
This hate therefore is the hate of diſſimulation, not
of perſecution: of auoiding, not of annoieng: of eſchewing,
not of vndoing: of godlineſſe, not of cruelneſſe. For,
then ought we, as it were to hate them, to paſſe by them,
to kéepe vs from them, when we cannot ſerue God and
them both at once. But ſurelie, if both could conuenientlie
be done, then doubtleſſe God firſt of all muſt haue his
honour, & ſecondlie our parents their dutie and ſeruice.
               
               
                  
                     Verſes. 1. 2. &. 3.
                  
                  
                     1 For this is right.
                     2 Honour thy father and mother,
(vvhich is the firſt commandement
vvith promiſe:)
                     3 That it maie be vvell vvith
thee, and that thou maiſt liue
long on earth.
                  
                  For this is right. Honour thy
father and thy mother (which
is the firſt commandement in
promiſe:) that it maie goe well
with thee, and that thou maiſt
liue long vpon earth.
                  THis is a reaſon of the exhortation ſet downe before:
and it ſtandeth vpon thrée pointes: namelie,
vpon that which is honeſt, vpon the cauſe commanding,
and vpon that which is profitable. It is honeſt and right
to giue thanks for good turnes: to our parents ſpeciallie,
which begot and brought vs vp. The cauſe commanding,
is the lawe of God, which chargeth children
to honour their parents. It is profitable ſo to doe.
Whie? Bicauſe of the happie ſucceſſe, good lucke, and long
life, which followeth therevpon.
                  But héere certeine queſtions are to be canuaſſed and
ſifted out, the firſt whereof is this: Doth it not oftentimes
fall out, that godlie and vertuous children die before
their time, and too too ſoone? How then ſhall this promiſe
of long life vpon earth be ſure, ſteddie, and
vndoubted, to truſt vnto? Doe not vngodlie and vngratious
children liue a long time, and ſée manie daies? I
aunſwere.
                  
                     
This muſt firſt of all bée conſidered, that what earthlie
benefite, or temporall gifte ſo euer, our moſt louing
and heauenlie Father doth promiſe vs, the ſame is to
bée receiued vpon this condition: to wit, ſo farre foorth
as it turneth vs to good, and ſerueth for the ſaluation of
our ſoule. Wherefore it commeth to paſſe, and that not
ſeldome, that how much more God loueth his childe, ſo
much the ſooner he taketh him out of this life: according
to that ſaieng, Ablatus eſt iuſtus, &c. The iuſt and
righteous man is taken awaie before his time, leaſt wickedneſſe
ſhould chaunge his diſpoſition, and maliciouſneſſe
marre his manners.
                  
                  Now, becauſe it happeneth ſometimes, that wicked
and vngratious children liue long: the cauſe thereof is
the long ſuffering and gentleneſſe of God, calling them
to repentance, which if they ſet at naught, they laie
vp for themſelues, treaſure againſt the daie of wrath,
that they maie euen then be tormented with euerlaſting
paines for their ſtifnecked ſtubborneneſſe.
                  Whie doth the Apoſtle call this commaundement,
(The firſt with promiſe,) béeing in déede the fourth in
place and order: ſéeing alſo the firſt commaundement
hath a promiſe ioined with it, euen the promiſe of Gods
fauour and mercie? I aunſwere: Wée muſt marke,
that in the lawe of God, promiſe is of two ſortes: the
one generall, the other ſpeciall or particular. That is
a generall promiſe, which the firſt commandement hath
hanging vpon it, which is in déede a promiſe of a vniuerſall
or whole obedience to the lawe of God: that
is to ſaie, it doth not properlie belong to the firſt commaundement,
but vnto all the commaundements, or to
the vniuerſall and whole obedience of the lawe. The ſpeciall
or particular promiſe is that, which particularlie and
ſeuerallie by it ſelfe is tied to ſome one commandement:
as, long life is promiſed in the fourth commandement, to
be the reward of obedience towards our parents,
                  
                     
Furthermore, the demand touching the neceſſitie of
the end of euerie ones life, appointed by deſtinie, is aunſwered
out of this place. For theſe words of the Apoſtle
do manifeſtlie diſproue & ouerthrowe them, which ſaie,
that the terme of life cannot be ſhortened by ſinne & offenſe:
nor yet prolonged by dutie & obedience. Which if
it ſhould be true, the holie Ghoſt would not in anie wiſe
promiſe happie ſucceſſe, and long life vnto them, which
honour their parents: and it were flat againſt all reaſon,
if this obedience ſhould doe no good at all, either for
the proſperous falling out of things, or for the lengthening
of life.
                  Againſt this falſe imagination therefore of the Stoikes,
which doth not onelie hurt and rauiſh manners, but
alſe quite putteth out and deſtroieth all exerciſes of godlineſſe,
moſt ſure and ſtedfaſt teſtimonies muſt be prouided,
and learned: of which teſtimonies there are thrée
kindes ſpeciallie, which ouerthrowe this neceſſitie of
the terme or end of our life, which deſtinie hath made
certeine, vndoubted, and vnmoueable, as ſaie the Stoikes.
the Teſtimonies are theſe, promiſes of obedience,
threatenings for ſtubborneneſſe, and examples of
both.
                  
                     Teſtimonies of promiſes, becauſe they are manie,
theſe few ſhall ſerue the turne. It is thus ſaid in Exodus
& Deuteronomie, Honora patrem tuum, & matrem tuam,Exod. 20. 12.
&c. Honour thy father, and thy mother, that thy
daies maie be prolonged vpon the land,Deut. 5. 16 which the Lord
giueth thee.Prou. 9. 11 
                     Againe, in the Prouerbs: Per me multiplicabuntur,
&c.Prou. 10. 2. 27. Thy daies ſhall be multiplied by me, and
the yeares of thy life ſhall be augmented. Againe, Iuſticia
liberabit, &c. Righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death.
And againe, Timor Domini, &c. The feare of the Lord
increaſeth the daies.
                  Of theſe promiſes there are manie examples.Deut. 9. 13 14. When
God threatned that he would deſtroie the ſtifnecked people,



                     Moſes intreateth for them, and according to promiſe,
the penitent were ſpared. The deſtruction & ouerthrowe
of the Niniuites was pronounced euen by Gods owne
mouth,Ionas. 3. 2. 4. 10. to fall vpon them the fourtith daie after Ionas began
to preach: but yet according to promiſe, the penitent
were ſpared.2. Sam. 14. 17. 18. 21. 25. 
                     Dauid maketh his praier vnto God,
and reared vp an altar, that the peſtilence might ceaſe:

                        ſaie. 38. 3. 5. As for Ezechias, what ſhould
I ſpeake of him? His repentance got him fiftéene yeares
longer life.
                  There are verie manie teſtimonies of threatenings
for ſtubborneſſe, ſtiffeneckedneſſe, and diſobedience, ſuch
as theſe:Pro. 20. 20 
                     Qui maledicit, &c. He that curſeth his father
or his mother, his light ſhall be put out in obſcure places,
or in the middeſt of darkneſſe.
                     Pro. 10. 27 Againe, Anni impiorum,
&c. The yeares of the wicked ſhalbe diminiſhed.
                     Pſa. 54. 23
Againe in the Pſalme, Viri ſanguinum, &c. The
bloudie and deceiptfull men, ſhall not liue halfe their
daies. In the 20. Chapter of Leuiticus, the Lord threateneth
a rooting out of wicked offenders from among
their people, which rooting out, can be nothing elſe, but a
ſhortening and cutting off of their life, for the fowle offenſes
which they committed.
                  Of theſe teſtimonies, there are manie examples. Her
the ſonne of Iuda,
                     Gen. 38. 7. 9 10. becauſe he was wicked in the ſight of
the Lord, it is ſaid that the Lord ſlew him. Againe, Onan
ſpilling his ſéede vpon the ground, leaſt he ſhould
raiſe vp iſſue vnto his brother, was alſo ſlaine of the
Lord.Ioſua. 7. 1 25. 26. 
                     Achan, for the ſpoile of the excommunicate thing,
was commaunded euen by Gods owne mouth, to bée ſtoned
to death. Theſe promiſes, and threatenings, with
their examples, doe plainlie enough diſproue and ouerthrowe
the opinion of the Stoikes, touching the end and
ternie of life, guided by deſtinie.
                  With theſe reaſons accordeth the ſaieng of Iob:
                     Iob. 7. 1.
which they wreſt to the ſtabliſhing of their opinion.Iob. 14. 5 For



                     Iob ſpeaketh vnder condition, wherevpon it is manifeſt,
nothing can be proued. And although one or other ſtand
in it ſtoutlie, that by the words of Iob there is a certeine
end of life limitted, ſet and appointed: let him or them
knowe, that the ſaieng of Iob, concerning the ende of life
limitted, ſet, & appointed, is not to be referred vnto cauſes
of deſtinie, but to the obedience and diſobedience of Gods
commaundement.
                  Heerevnto alſo ſerueth the demaund touching the vanitie
of Natiuitie-caſters, and Fortune-tellers: that is to
ſaie, of them, which by birthſtarres: that is, by ſtarres
which ariſe at euerie ones comming into the world, tell
folkes fortunes, their good lucke, and their ill lucke. And
although it is to be graunted, that all earthlie things,
andAl things vnder the moone are ſo called inferiour bodies, haue a kinde of affinitie or kinred
(as it were) with the courſe of the ſtarres, and ſo come
by their diſpoſition and qualitie: yet notwithſtanding,
the knowledge and certeintie of euerie mans diſpoſition
and manners, their health and ſickneſſe, what ſhall
chaunce vnto them, and what they ſhall doe or ſuffer
in their life: beſides all that, when, where, and after
what ſort they ſhall die: cannot bée concluded therevpon.
                  Theſe are in a manner, the things which our Chaldeans,
Aegyptians, or Aſtrologers profeſſe themſelues ſkilfull
& cunning to tell, before they come to paſſe. For, as
we denie not vnto that moſt noble Art, which they name
naturall Aſtrologie, the knowledge of Natures order,
and the mouings of heauenlie bodies: euen ſo we vtterlie
miſlike their ſuperſtition, who profeſſing indiciall Aſtrologie,
(for with this great and glorious title they
decke and garniſh their ſuperſtition,) doe meaſure and
geſſe euerie mans fortune by the houre of his birth. For,
to ſpeake of euerie mans manners, and of their health or
ſickneſſe, ſtrength or weakneſſe, diſpoſitions and complexions,
I ſaie and auouch it, that there can no certeintie



bée concluded by the ſtarres.
                  And although there be ſome conſent & accord of the
ſtars with theſe inferiour bodies, wherby the properties
& eſtates, which peculiarlie belong to bodies, are framed:
and ſometimes alſo perteine to affections in men, which
for the moſt part conſiſt in complexions: yet notwithſtanding,
the Natiuitie-caſters, and Fortune-tellers,
doe farre ouerſhoote the marke, when they giue iudgement
according to the time of birth. For, whiles they
confeſſe, that recourſe muſt be made from the time of
bearing, to the time of begetting: what doe they elſe, but
bewraie their owne vanitie? For, it is not poſſible, that
Natiuitie-caſters and Fortune-tellers ſhould heare and
knowe for certeintie, the verie time of conception or
begetting.
                  For, ſeeing that the time of birth, is not onelie oftentimes
ſooner than it ſhould be: but alſo (and that not ſeldome)
put off and delaied the longer, through the weakneſſe
of the woman with child, or which lies in labour:
how is it poſſible (I beſéech you) to knowe the verie inſtant
of ones begetting? Speciallie, if but in the miſſing
of a verie few minutes of an houre, there is woont to be
a verie great inclination and mouing of the heauens
and the ſtarres? He therefore that will certeinlie, & vndoubtedlie
tell before hand, by the time of birth, what
ſhall happen héereafter, he had néede, taking his Aſtralobe,
and holding it in his hand, to ſtand by, euen at the
time of begetting, when the verie deede is a dooing.
For, it is no ſure truſting of Clockes or Dialls in ſo
weightie a matter.
                  Furthermore, ſéeing manie are borne at one and the
ſelfe ſame inſtant of time, and yet nothing like in nature
and manners, what man béeing well in his wits,
will beléeue, that the manners of men depend vpon the
ſtarres? Beſides that, the force of the seede, which bréedeth
the childe, is much greater than the force of the



ſtarres, as touching the framing of manners. For we ſee
manie expreſſe the nature and manners of their parents,
of whoſe ſeede they were begotten. As for the ſpirituall
begetting, whereby the manners of the ſaints are framed,
it hath no place héere. For, that begetting dependeth
not vpon the ſtarres, but vpon the will of God.
                  Now, touching bodilie health, although I iudge that
in ſome part, the ſtarres haue to deale therein: yet notwithſtanding,
I flatlie denie, that it can be certeinlie
told of Natiuitie-caſters, and Fortune-tellers: becauſe
of the vncerteintie of begetting. Vpon the ſelfe ſame
foundation are their flim flam tales builded, which profeſſe
that they can tell (as right as a rams horne,) what
ſhall chaunce to euerie man in his life: and this (forſooth)
they will ſhewe you by the ſtarre, vnder which they
were borne. For as the time of begetting is vncerteine,
as hath bene alreadie declared: ſo the cauſes of chaunces
in a mans life, proceed from ſome other meanes & place.
The ſaieng of the Lord remaineth faſt and ſure, Honora
parentes,
                     Exo. 20. 12 
                     vt benè tibi ſit, Honour thy parents, that
it maie goe well with thee.
                     Deu. 5. 16. This oracle is as certeine,
as what is moſt certeine, which no decrée of Natiuitie-caſters
and Fortune-tellers: nor anie birthſtarre is able
to chaunge or take awaie.
                  Touching their tittle tattle of the kinde and time of
death, it is a tale as vaine as the reſt. For this is to bée
abidden by, that in one ſkirmiſh, and in one houre thréeſcore
thouſand men were ſlaine, all which (out of doubt)
had diuers and ſundrie birthſtars. It is as true alſo, that
at one inſtant of time, children haue bene borne, who
notwithſtanding died at ſeuerall times.
                  Out of theſe I conclude, that their ſuperſtition is
moſt vaine, which will haue mens chaunces and fortunes,
ſubiect to their iudiciall Aſtrologie. Let them
gainſaie what they can, theſe reaſons maie ſuffice to
ſpie their iugglings, and to auoid their wiles. The birthſtarre



of a man, it dependeth either vpon the time of his
conception or begetting, or elſe vpon the time of his natiuitie
or birth: but both are vncerteine vnto ſuch, which
holding in their hand an Aſtralobe, ſtand not by them
that are a begetting, and them that are in childbearing.
Againe, if the iſſue of things commonlie called (Lucke)
depend vpon the ſtarres, then ſhall the deſtinie of all ſuch
as haue one and the ſelfe ſame birthſtarre, be alike: but
euerie one that is well in his wits, will ſaie that this is
ſtarke falſe.
                  If good lucke depend vpon the ſtarres, then ſhall obedience
to Godward, depend vpon them too. For this is the
proper cauſe of that. Furthermore, if the kind of death,
and all manner of miſfortunes depend vpon the ſtarres,
then ſhall ſinnes depend vpon them too: which is horrible
to be ſpoken. Séeing the caſe ſtandeth ſo, I wiſh
the wiſer ſort to be warned, that as it is méete to ſette
ſtore by true and naturall Aſtrologie, which is verie profitable
in our life, and a notable and excellent gifte of
God: ſo to take héede and auoid theſe deceiuers, theſe
Iacke iugglers, and common Couſeners, which profeſſe
that they can certeinlie tell, by birthſtarres, what good
lucke, and what ill lucke, ſhall light vpon a man, or a
woman in this life: ſpeciallie, ſéeing that ſuperſtition is
meruellous hurtfull to good manners, flat againſt honeſt
and good lawes, and as it were a diſgracing of God: who
witneſſeth, his owne ſelfe, that as a proſperous eſtate,
and happie ſucceſſe of all things, are the rewards of obedience:
ſo miſfortunes, and all kinde of diſcommodities
and miſchiefes are the puniſhments of ſinne.
                  As for that which ſome bring in, going about to make
the beſt of theſe mens madneſſe: to wit, that the ſtarres
haue not a ſure, a ſtedfaſt, & an vndoubted working: Againe,
that ſtarres doe gentlie incline or drawe to, and
not roughlie compell: I ſaie ſo too, ſo that this inclination
or bending be referred onelie to bodies, and complexions



of bodies, by their leaue: and not vnto the
mindes & willes of men, which haue in them 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
that is, election or choice: which is an abilitie,
not bound, but at libertie, whereby the will hauing great
choice of things, taketh this and that, according as it is
lead: as, to followe vertue, and auoid vice.
                  But this is little agreeable to the goodlie and gaie
promiſes of our Chaldeans, Aegyptians, or Aſtrologians,
who will haue their Art and cunning ſo firme, faſt,
and vnmoueable, as they dare boaſt, that nothing can
be done, but according to the rule and appointment therof.
For, an inclination is not a neceſſarie cauſe of anie
thing, ſpeciallie in men, who maie be gouerned by the
iudgement of the minde, euen contrarie to inclination, if
it be euill. And, to hold my peace a while, there is nothing
more fooliſh and vnfit, than certeinlie to conceiue the
effect and full accompliſhment of a thing, vpon a péece of
a cauſe, the ſame being of the baſeſt order, & leaſt force
to bring forth an effect and full accompliſhment.
                  Now, in that the Mathematicians can foreſhew the
Eclipſes, and change of weather: this commeth to paſſe,
becauſe they depend vpon certeine cauſes, which cauſes,
according to the ordinance of God, do ueuer alter or varie.
And theſe: to wit, change of weather dependeth vpon
the inclination of ſtarres, which inclination neuer deceiueth
for the moſt part in things that lacke life. Wherfore
as Eclipſes ſtand vpon demonſtration: ſo change of weather
ſtandeth vpon coniecture. It is far otherwiſe in the
reaſonable abilities of the minde, ſpeciallie in the wils
of men, which are indifferenlie inclined vnto contraries,
as hath bene alreadie ſhewed.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 4.
                  
                  4 And ye, fathers, prouoke
not your children to vvrath, but
bring them vp in inſtruction,
and information of the Lord.
                  And ye, fathres, prouoke not your
children to anger, but bring them
vp in learning, & the rebuking (or
feare) of the Lord.
                  
                     
THis is the fourth ſpecialtie, anſwerable to the former.
For, as that required of children their obedience:
ſo this aſketh a dutie of parents, like in proportion and
meaſure towards their children. And in the firſt place,
the Apoſtle ſetteth downe, of what things fathers ought
to take heede: ſecondlie, what they ought to do with their
children. He giueth them warning, to beware in anie
wiſe of too ſtreight and ſharpe handling, ſeaſoned with
no loue or gentleneſſe. For hard handling, wherein appeareth
no fatherlie loue or affection, hath manie inconueniences
ioined with it. For, firſt of all, it maketh their
children dizzards, dolts, blocke-heads, heauie-hearted,
and dull of ſpirit. Secondlie, it bréedeth hatred by little
and little in their tender mindes, againſt their parents.
Thirdlie, this hatred, which they haue continued, maketh
place for ſtubborneſſe and rebellion: ſo that, when
thou wouldeſt win them by gentlenes & faire meanes,
the miſchiefe being ſo far growne, thy labour is but loſt.
But where parents execute their rule and power well ouer
their children: there doth authoritie hold them in
feare, & willingneſſe to obeie▪ and kindneſſe keepeth them
in loue and readineſſe to pleaſe. As therefore too much
making, and as we ſaie, cockering of our children, is the
next waie to make them ſluggards, & wantons: ſo a wiſe
bringing of them vp, & a right and orderlie vſing of them,
maketh them quicke ſpirited, honeſt, & thriftie. Now, the
apoſtle addeth, what parents ought to do with their children,
and that brieflie, when he ſaith: (But bring them vp
in inſtruction, & information of the Lord.) Saint Paule
in this place requireth thrée things of godlie parents.
Firſt, (Bringing of them vp,) which thing parents are
bound to do to their children, by the lawe of nature. Secondlie,
(Diſcipline or inſtruction,) wherby as their children
maie be enured to the knowledge of godlie & honeſt
things, euen ſo they maie be made milde gentle, & courteous:
in ſo much that their wiſe conuerſation and



honeſt behauing of themſelues, ſhall turne in the end to
the comfort and honour of their parents, and to the profite
and commoditie of the Commonwealth.
                  For, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in Gréeke, Inſtruction in Latine, is a
certeine abilitie of the minde, whereby a man is made
friendlie to himſelfe, and louing to others: which thing
doubtleſſe cannot come to paſſe, without honeſt bringing
vp, and well inſtructing of them in the knowledge of
things profitable and neceſſarie. Héerevpon it is, that this

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      or Inſtruction, doth ſignifie ſometimes, by the
figure Metonymia, the verie inſtructing it ſelfe.
                  Againe, becauſe the ſtint of inſtruction is humanitie,
therfore doth 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      or inſtruction, ſignifie other while,
by the figure Prolepſis, humanitie it ſelfe alſo: that is
to ſaie, a méeknes, & courteſie in maners, and a tractableneſſe
in a mans whole life. Thirdlie, (Information of
the Lord.) The olde Interpreter hath ſet downeOr Chaſtiſement: The Latine copie hath Correptio, which I cannot more aptlie Engliſh. 
                     Rebuking
in ſtéede of Information, which is not well done.
For the Gréeke word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , betokeneth in generall,
ſuch an information, wherby that is put into ones mind,
which is néedefull to be done.
                  The genitiue caſe, Domini, (of the Lord,) is in place
of an Adiectiue. For the Apoſtles meaning is, that ſuch
things ſhould be put into tender and young mindes, by
dailie admoniſhments, as tend to true godlineſſe, and to
the feare of the Lord: beſides this alſo, that they maie
be drawne to the learning of ſuch arts and ſciences, as
they ſéeme to be moſt fit for by nature.
                  
                     Nazianzenus writing to Eudoxus the Rhetorician,
ſaith, it was an auncient lawe in Athens: yea, a verie good
lawe, which gaue commandement, that ſo ſoone as children
came to yeares of diſcretion, they ſhould be put out
to learne arts & ſciences: which thing was done in this
manner. There were brought & laid in open place, inſtruments
or tooles belonging to euerie art & occupation: now
ſir, the youth of that countrie being brought thither, choſe



euerie one for himſelfe, ſuch tooles as ſerued that trade
of life, wherein they moſt delighted: héerevpon commandement
was giuen by the magiſtrate, that they ſhould
learne that ſcience and occupation, which they had taken
themſelues vnto, nature hauing giuen plaine proofe therof
before. To this perteineth that ſaieng of the Poet:
Tuï nihil, &c.
                  
                  
                     That thing thou ſhalt not ſaie, or do,
                     Which Nature noddeth not vnto.
                  
                  It is the parents charge therefore, diligentlie to marke
and conſider, for what trades of life their children ſeeme
moſt fit. Let parents alſo themſelues learne firſt of all
héerhence, that God requireth earneſtlie at their hands,
to inſtruct their children, euen with their owne voice and
information, in true religion. And let none thus thinke
with himſelfe, that to indue tender & young mindes with
doctrines or leſſons of godlineſſe, belongeth to Churchmen,
and Schoolemaiſters onelie: but alſo, that it is the
dutie of parents much more to do this: who ought to ſowe
the ſéeds of godlineſſe in their childrens tender mindes,
together with their milke.
                  Let children alſo learne, that it is their part, not onelie
to obeie their parents, training them vp in godlineſſe:
but alſo to frame their manners & behauiours diligentlie
to the rule of godlineſſe. They therefore that thinke but
ſo ſo of the ſtudies & endeuours of godlineſſe themſelues,
or cauſe others by their meanes, to neglect & paſſe little
for inſtructing their children, euen in their young years,
with all diligence in Chriſtian religion, let them ſée to
it, what anſwere they will make vnto our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, who (by the holie mouth of Saint Paule) commendeth
euen to children the ſtudie and learning of the
holie Scriptures.

                     5 Seruants, be obedient vnto
them that are your maiſters: according
to the fleſh, vvith feare
& trembling, in ſingleneſſe of
your hearts, as vnto Chriſt,
                     6 Not vvith ſeruice to the eie,
as men pleaſers: but as the ſeruants
of Chriſt, doing the will
of God from the heart,
                     7 With good vvill ſeruing the
Lord, and not men.
                  
                  Seruants obeie your maiſters,
according to the fleſh, with
feare and trembling, in ſimplicitie
of your heart, as vnto
Chriſt, not ſeruing to the eie
as pleaſing men, but as the
ſeruants of Chriſt, doing the
will of God from the heart,
with good will, ſeruing the
Lord, and not men.
                  AS the Apoſtle commended before, vnto children, and
fathers of families, duties anſwerable to their callings:
ſo héere he appointeth ſeruants their duties towards
their maiſters, according to the fleſh. And although
ſuch kinde of ſeruice, as was vſed in Saint Paules time
among manie, is ſeldome ſéene among vs: yet notwithſtanding,
this precept of Saint Paule, belongeth to our
men and maiden ſeruants. But the circumſtances of this
precept, are diligentlie to be conſidered.
                  For, firſt of all, he requireth at ſeruants hands, (Obedience
with feare:) that is to ſaie, an obedience ioined
with a carefull reuerence. Secondlie, his will is, that
this obedience ſhould procéed from (Singleneſſe of heart:)
which kéepeth frowardneſſe and hidden hatred out of poſſeſſion.
For, S. Paules meaning is, that the heart ſhould
not diſagrée from outward obedience. Thirdlie, he ſetteth
downe the cauſe, and the manner, when he ſaith, (As
vnto Chriſt.) For, the Apoſtle in theſe words giueth vs
this leſſon, that ſeruaunts ſhould haue an eie, in euerie
thing, which they are about, to the will and commaundement
of God. As therfore ſeruants owe obedience to their
maſters, for Gods commandement ſake: ſo they ſhall take
héed, that they do nothing, for their bodilie maiſters pleaſure,
againſt the commandement of God. Fourthlie, becauſe



ſeruants are woont, for the moſt part, to ſerue to the
eie, and not to the minde: therefore doth Saint Paule
charge Chriſtian ſeruants to doe their dueties with diligence
in the preſence of the Lord, Abſque 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
that is to ſaie, without (Eie-ſeruice,) and flattering
faſhion: thinking heerevpon, that the Lord requireth at
their hands, a ſeruice from the heart, with a good minde,
and a good will.
                  Furthermore, this place of the Apoſtle, doth moſt plainlie
diſproue the errour of the Anabaptiſts & Libertines,
who will haue (forſooth) among Chriſtians a certeine barbarous
& brutiſhWhich ſignifieth rebellion, libertie, an aboliſhing or vtter diſplacing of rule & gouernement, &c Anarchie, that none maie obeie other,
but be all alike, chéeke by choule checkmate. For, they define
Chriſtian libertie amiſſe, in ſaieng: that it is a kind
of manumiſſion or ſetting frée from all maner of ſeruice
or bondage, as well temporall as eccleſiaſticall: not knowing
this, that Chriſtian libertie conſiſteth in the ſpirit,
and not in the fleſh.
                  Againe, this place both teacheth, and alſo comforteth
godlie ſeruants. It teacheth them verilie, that the ſtate of
life, wherein they liue, pleaſeth God, if they behaue themſelues
according to the rule ſet downe before them by
Saint Paule. It comforteth them alſo, which are kept vnder
with a ſeruice ſomewhat hard and ſtreight, whiles
they, learning this leſſon of Saint Paule, perſuade themſelues,
that they are not onelie ſubiect to the will of God:
but alſo take this for a ſure ground, that God counteth
that done to himſelfe, which is done with ſingleneſſe to
their maiſters after the fleſh. Let no ſeruant therefore,
neither hée nor ſhée, ſhake off their yoke of ſeruice,

what good thing ſoeuer hee
doth, ſhall receiue of the Lord
whether he bee bonde, or
free.
                  SAint Paule addeth a confirmation or proofe, taken
from a well knowne ſpeach vttered in Scripture.
For God beateth much vpon this promiſe euerie where
in the Scriptures,Ruth. 2. 12 that he will remember our labour,1. Sam. 26. 23. and
the worke of our hands, promiſing a large reward to all
them that obeie his voice.2. Chro. 15. 7. Seruants therefore ought to
haue an eie to this promiſe in their labours and handie
works,Pſal 18. 20 making this full account,Prou. 13. 21 that God is true & iuſt
in his promiſes,Eſaie. 1. 19 and that the reward promiſed for their
obedience,Eſaie. 40. 10. is to be looked for from God.
                  But, becauſe the Papiſts abuſe ſhamefullie, theſe and
ſuch like ſaiengs,Eſaie. 62. 11. concerning the rewards of good works,
to the ouerthrowing of Gods truth touching frée iuſtification:Eſaie. 65 6 7. 8. 9.
therefore I will brieflie declare, how theſe and
ſuch like ſaiengs are to be vnderſtood,Iere. 31. 14 according to the analogie,Tob. 4. 19.
proportion,Eccle. 11. 17. and rule of faith.
                  Firſt of all we muſt knowe, that theſe and ſuch like
generall promiſes,Mat. 7. 11. are to bée applied vnto all men, but
not after one and the ſelfe ſame manner.Pſal. 62. 12 For, there are
two ſorts of men, according to whoſe diuerſitie, the application
of the promiſe muſt be made. For, ſome are godlie,
that is to ſaie, borne a new, and the children of God.
Otherſome are vngodlie, not borne a new, and the children
of wrath.
                  If thou wilt applie the ſaiengs touching promiſes of
rewards, to the latter ſort of men, thou proueſt nothing
elſe thereby, but that they remaine the children of wrath,
vnder wrath. For, they are able to doe nothing that can
pleaſe God, although their workes heare an outward
ſhew of ſpeciall holineſſe. For, this Oracle of the holie
Ghoſt abideth alwaies ſure and ſtedfaſt, Impoſsibile eſt
placere Deo, ſine fide: It is vnpoſsible to pleaſe God,
without faith.
                     Heb. 11. 6. So long therefore as men are voide of



faith, they are like rotten trées, which can beare no fruit.
So that it maie be concluded héerevpon, euen by moſt
manifeſt and ſound proofe, that when God giueth the
wicked, the reward due to their works, hell and damnation
ſhall be their recompenſe.
                  But if thou wilt applie the promiſes of reward to the
former ſort of men: to wit, the children of God, then muſt
thou thinke vpon theſe points in thy mind, orderlie. Firſt
of all, thou ſhalt build vpon this, that the godlie are deliuered
from the rigour of the lawe, through Chriſt, as S.
Paule ſaith:Gal. 3. 13. 
                     Chriſtus redemit nos, &c. Chriſt hath redeemed
vs from the curſſe of the lawe,
                     Gal. 4. 4. 5 
                     beeing made a
curſſe for vs.
                     Tit. 2. 14. The condemning ſentence therefore of the
lawe, cannot hurt the children of God: that is to ſaie, the
beléeuers. Secondlie thou ſhalt conſider, that the beléeuer
maie pleaſe God, by faith, and maie be an heire of euerlaſting
life. Thirdlie, thou ſhalt perſuade thy ſelfe, that
God doth not onelie require new obedience at the hands
of the beléeuer: but alſo promiſeth a reward: howbeit,
not of dutie, for the worthineſſe of the worke: but of his
méere grace, for his fatherlie promiſe ſake. Fourthlie, thou
ſhalt make this reckoning, that works done by faith, are
witneſſes of faith: and the effects of faith, moſt aſſured
ſignes of their proper cauſe. Héerevpon God is ſaid to
paie euerie man his reward, according to his workes:
becauſe works are true euidences of faith, and the feare
of the Lord.
                  This ſolution or anſwere maie trimlie be made plainer,
by a compariſon betwéene the heauenlie Father, and
an earthlie Father. For, as an earthlie Father doth promiſe
vnto his children, ſometime a large inheritaunce,
ſometime a rich reward, &c. as the wages or reward for
their worke, if they ſhew themſelues dutifull and obedient,
although they were not heires before by nature:
euen ſo God the heauenlie Father, promiſeth to his children,
whom he loueth in Chriſt, euerlaſting life, as the



reward for their obedience ſhewed by faith. The promiſes
of reward, being thus applied, ſtirre vp in the godlie
an endeuour to obeie: beſides that, they make nothing at
all for proofe of the Papiſts wicked doctrine.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 9.
                  
                  9 And ye maiſters, doe the
ſame things vnto them, putting
avvaie threatenings: & knowe
that euen your maiſter is in
heauen, neither is there reſpect
of perſon with him.
                  And ye maiſters doe ye the
ſame things towards them, letting
goe threatenings, knowing
that euen your maiſter alſo is
in heauen, and there is not anie
reſpect of perſon with him.
                  THis is the laſt exhortation touching the ſeuerall duties
of one to an other, in their calling: and it anſwereth
that which went next before. The Apoſtle requireth
two things of maiſters. The firſt is, (To do the
ſame things vnto them:) to wit, vnto their ſeruants, that
they kéeping the right rule of proportion, maie ſhew to
their ſeruants good will againe for their ſeruice. For, the
Apoſtle doth not require in maiſters, ſuch and the like labours,
ſuch and the like diligence, ſuch and the like ſubmiſſion,
as he requireth in ſeruants: but a dutie anſwerable
to their place and perſon.
                  Let the ſeruant therefore labour faithfullie, and let
the maiſter againe on the other ſide, make much of his
ſeruant, giue him his wages for his worke, & ſée that hée
lacke nothing that is neceſſarie: all this muſt be done,
(In Domino, In the Lord.) For this is the meaning of
the Apoſtle, when he ſaith, (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , The ſame things,)
to the intent, that a iuſt proportion of duetie might bée
kept, betwéene the maiſter, and the ſeruant. The ſecond
thing, which the Apoſtle requireth of maiſters, is: (To
put awaie threatning.) By which word of (Threatning,)
he meaneth all manner of hard handling towardes
their ſeruants.
                  
                     
To this exhortation he addeth a reaſon drawne from
like matters, and ſaith: (And knowe, that euen your
maiſter alſo is in heauen.) As if he ſhould ſaie, There is
no cauſe whie ye ſhuld ouercrowe your ſeruants, & think
your ſelues iollie fellowes, in reſpect of them, for your
maiſterſhip ſake: no, no. For, euen ye your ſelues haue
a maiſter alſo in heauen, who can be with you to bring,
notwithſtanding your maiſterſhip, or the pouertie of your
ſeruants, which are not things that he is lead by. For,
there is no reſpect of perſon with him, as there is with
wicked and vniuſt iudges: but according to the truth &
vprightneſſe of the cauſe, ſo he frameth his iudgement.
For the Lord (ſaith S. Ambroſe) is a righteous iudge,
looking vpon the cauſe, and not eieng the perſon. The
word (Perſon) in this place, doeth not ſignifie the ſubſtance,
but the qualitie: that is to ſaie, whatſoeuer
is regarded in iudgement, beſides the trueth of the
cauſe.
                  Theſe wordes therefore (Of reſpect of perſons,)
ought not to be wreſted to a contrarie meaning. For,
there is in them a compariſon betwéene God and men
Men (for the moſt part) giue iudgement after the things
which they ſée with their eies, and which outwardlie appeare:
they are moued with linage or birth, with riches,
with kinred, and with friendſhippe: againe, ſometimes
with hatred, with loue, and other affections:
whereby it commeth to paſſe, that they ouerſlipping the
trueth and equitie of the cauſe, giue wrong iudgement.
                  As for God, whoſe iudgement is right, and according
to truth, he chaungeth not his righteous iudgement
for the maiſters ſake, not yet for the ſeruaunts
ſake: but he iudgeth according to the truth of the cauſe,
not hauing anie regard to this or that perſon. For hée
followeth without ſtint, & inceſſantlie, this vnremoueable
rule of iuſtice. For, he receiueth the repentant into fauor:



as for the vnrepentant and ſtubborne, he cannot awaie
with them, they are outlawes.
                  Héerehence all godlie maiſters haue to learne to humble
themſelues before God, who is their maiſter, as well
as their ſeruants maiſter: and let them be mindfull, by
his example, not to ſet their ſeruants at naught, becauſe
of their outward perſon: that is to ſaie, their vile & baſe
eſtate: but rather to make more account of them. And
whie? For, although the condition of ſeruaunts differ
from that of maiſters héere on earth: yet notwithſtanding,
they haue all one maiſter in heauen, whome
both of them ought to ſerue and obeie, as fellowe-ſeruaunts.

                  THE Apoſtle returneth to a generall exhortation,
where (after the doctrine of grace, after exhortations
to vertues worthie of the Goſpell, & after peculiar duties
belonging to certeine ſeuerall degrées of men,) he calleth
vpon all the godlie, vnder the name of the Epheſians, and
exhorteth them to be ſtrong in minde: taking vnto them
ſuch armour, as maie withſtand the ſnares of the diuell:
a verie mightie enimie doubtleſſe, if we ſhall
looke vpon his manifolde aſſaultes, his ſubtile vnderminings,
his ſundrie waies of laieng in waite,
and our owne ſtrength, which is but weakneſſe:
howbeit, a diſcomfited enimie, and not able to reſiſt, if
we beholde him, in whome reſteth our whole power



and valiantneſſe. For, when we leane vpon him, with a
ſteddie and ſure confidence: it commeth to paſſe, that the
Diuell, be he neuer ſo big, ſuffereth ſhipwracke himſelfe,
though he ſtirreth vp tempeſts, and raiſeth ſtormes, to
ſinke the ſeruants of God.
                  In the Apoſtles words, the manner of exhortation is
to be marked. He ſaith thus, (Be ſtrong in the Lord, &
in the power of his might.) Firſt, there is ſignified vnto
to vs, by this manner of exhorting, that without the
Lord, and without his mightie power, we can preuaile
nothing at all, againſt ſo terrible and violent an enimie
as the Diuell. Secondlie, that we being made members
of the Lord, are alſo made ſtrong by his ſtrength, to reſiſt
Sathan and his fierie weapons.
                  Of this ſtrength we are then made partakers, when
we truſt to, and ſtaie vpon our Lord Chriſt, with a liuelie
confidence, when we are made the children of God,
and the members of Chriſt: which is euident by
theſe words of the Apoſtle,1. Ioh. 5. 
                     Haec eſt victoria, &c. This
is the victorie which ouercommeth the world, euen
your faith. Therefore, that ſtrength which maketh vs able
to withſtand Sathan and the fleſh, is not of nature,
but of grace. And Chriſt is that ſtrength, on whom wée
laie faſt hold by faith. Héereto ſerueth that ſaieng of
Saint Paule,
                     1. Tim. 18. 19. 
                     Milita honeſtam militiam, &c. Fight a
good fight, hauing faith and a good conſcience, which
ſome haue put awaie, & as concerning faith haue made
ſhipwracke.
                  
                  And although this ſtrength commeth from the Lord:
yea, the Lord himſelfe is that ſtrength: yet notwithſtanding,
when the Apoſtle exhorteth vs to (Be ſtrong,)
and to (Put on the whole armour of God,) he requireth
our trauell and endeuour. It is neceſſarie therefore, that
our will ſhould runne actiuelie therewithall, and not
onelie paſſiuelie. For, as we maie, if we will, caſt off
faith, and reſiſt the holie ſpirit: ſo being conuerted and



turned, we can kéepe faith and the holie ſpirit by grace,
and ſtirre vp the gift of God in vs,2. Tim. 1. 6. as Saint Paule ſpeaketh.
For, the gift of God is a certeine quicke and liuelie
flame, as it were, in the hearts of beléeuers, which
Sathan and the fleſh can ſmoother and choke vp: whiles
we lie ſlugging & ſnorting in our neaſts. Wherefore, S.
Paules warning to Timothie is not in waſte, where he
ſaith:2. Tim. 1. 6. 
                     Stirre vp the gift of God which is in thee. This
gift therefore muſt not be quenched and put out. To
the ſame purpoſe alſo ſerueth that ſaieng of the Apoſtle
to the Theſſalonians,
                     1. Theſ 5. 19. 
                     Quench not the ſpirit.
                  
                  It is the part of a Chriſtian man therefore to walke
warilie, and carefullie before his God: and euermore to
take héede, that he loſe not the gifte, which he hath receiued
by grace, through his owne ſlothfulneſſe and idleneſſe.
To this belong all exerciſes of goodlineſſe, all exhortations
of godlie Shepheards, and the whole diſcipline
of the Church. For, theſe are certeine bellowes,
as it were, which doe quicken and raiſe vp
the flame kindeled in vs from aboue, by Gods good
grace.
                  Moreouer, this place of Saint Paule doeth teach all
the godlie, that they are ſet in a verie hot and heauie ſkirmiſh,
where they muſt fight it out, euerie one in his
ſtanding: looking for no truce, becauſe there is none to
be graunted. For, our aduerſarie is alwaies harneſſed,
weaponed, and keeping the field. And indéede (as Saint
Peter ſaith) He neuer reſteth raunging vp and downe,
                     1. Pet. 5. 8.
                     roaring (like a Lioneſſe that hath loſt her whelpes,) and
ſeeketh whom he may deuoure. This doth he one while
by offering open violence, another while by craftie ſaieng
in waite.
                  For, when he putteth men in the head, to caſt from
them, as a thing of naught, the doctrine of God: when
he bringeth in a traine of moſt filthie manners, ſlatte againſt
the lawe of God: when he filleth all places with



offenſes, and ſlaughters: then offereth he open violence,
and profeſſeth himſelfe the ſworne enimie of Chriſt. But
when he diſguiſeth himſelfe into an angel of light, and
putteth vpon vices the vizards of vertues: when he giueth
ſuperſtition a counterfaite face of holineſſe: when
he dealeth in this wiſe, then he lieth in waite craftilie
to catch vs. To them therefore, which are
not furniſhed with the whole armour of GOD,
the diuell is more terrible, furious, violent, and preuailing.
                  What ſhall we gather by this? Séeing the life of a
Chriſtian in this world, is a certeine ſpirituall warfare
and that againſt ſo mightie an enimie: it is méete verelie,
that we be like to, and alſo plaie the part of valiant
hearted ſouldiers, whom ſwilling, ſurfetting, or
ſléeping make not ſlouthfull & heauie-headed, béeing to
ſéeke in the time of moſt néede: but alwaies prouided
and prepared at the pinch, readie to fight with their enimies,
hand to hand: leaſt they ſhould be ſette vpon,
and ouerrunne at vnwares. Thus if we doe, we néed
doubt no daunger. For, when the Apoſtle addeth theſe
words, (That ye maie be able to ſtand againſt the aſſaults
of the diuell,) he meaneth, that we ſhall ouercome,
and get the victorie, if we holding faſt the armour, which
God reacheth out and giueth vs, ſhall fight ſtoutlie vnder
Chriſts banner, hauing full confidence in him.
                  The righteſt waie to ouercome this inuiſible enimie, is,
if thou begin with thine inward and houſhold enimie, to
tame him, & bring him vnder. This enimie is the fleſh, againſt
whom the ſpirit maketh batell. For the fleſh tempteth
vs with nothing, but that fleſhlie thing, which beareth
rule in vs: & thither ſhe bendeth her full force, whither
ſhe ſéeth men inclined of their owne accord. And ſo ye
fleſh turneth our owne weakneſſe, to the weapons of her
wickedneſſe, & vſeth the diſeaſe of our owne fleſh againſt
our ſelues: that is to ſaie, ſetteth vpon vs with our owne



affections, luſts, and deſires, as it were with warlike engines.
                  But if anie one demand, why God giueth the Diuell
leaue to haunt and laie ſuch hard hold at mankind,
in this manner? Athanaſius anſwereth in theſe words:
That they (ſaith he) which loue God,
                     In his eleuenth queſtion to Antiochus.
                      
                     maie bee made
manifeſt: and they that are giuen to vaine pleaſures
maie be turned off, and put awaie. For, if there were no
enimies to make warre, how ſhould the valiant ſouldiers
of a king be tried? To them therefore that loue
God, the Diuell is made the cauſe of victorie, of their
crowne or garland, of their reward and triumph.
Thus farre Athanaſius. But I aunſwere in a word,
that it is Gods decrée and appointment, to haue all his
children made like vnto his ſonne, in the croſſe and perſecution,
whom his purpoſe was long agoe, to glorifie
with his ſonne.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 12.
                  
                  12 For, vve vvreſtle not againſt
fleſh and bloud, but againſt
principalities, and againſt povvers,
& againſt the worldlie gouernors,
the princes of the darkneſſe
of this vvorld, againſt ſpirituall
vvickedneſſes, vvhich are
in the high places.
                  Becauſe our wrestling
is not againſt fleſh and bloud,
but againſt principalities (or
rules,) againſt powers, againſt
the worldlie gouernours of the
darkneſſe of this world, againſt
ſpirituall wickedneſſes, in heauenlie
places.
                  THis is a reaſon of the exhortation, drawne from the
greatneſſe of the daunger. For, after he hath ſet foorth
the fearefull power of a fearefull enimie, he ſtirreth vp
the Epheſians to the greater watchfulneſſe, leaſt they
ſhould ſuffer themſelues to be ouerrunne of ſo craftie
and mightie an enimie. For, the Apoſtle declareth and
laieth open before our eies, the forces of our enimies to
this ende: that thereby he might make vs the more



readie and couragious to fight. Now, in that the Apoſtle
ſaith, (We wreſtle not againſt fleſh and bloud,) hee
doth not denie, that we muſt haue a ſkirmiſhing againſt
men, and our owne fleſh: but he ſpeaketh by waie of
compariſon, as if he ſhould ſaie thus: If we looke vpon
the ſpirituall enimies, whom we haue haunting vs, that
ſkirmiſhing ſhall be accompted no fight, which is betwéene
vs and fleſh and bloud.
                  By this manner of ſpeach therefore, the greatneſſe of
the daunger, the kinde of the battell, and the qualitie of
the enimies, are ſignified and meant. Our enimies are
not fleſh and bloud: therefore our enimies are ſpirituall.
The battell which we muſt abide, is ſpirituall, doubtfull,
and daungerous: therefore ſpirituall weapons are
required, as S. Paule alſo putteth vs in minde, ſaieng:
Non ſunt carnalia,
                     2. Co. 10. 
                     &c. The weapons of our warrefare,
are not carnall, but mightie through God: that is to
ſaie, ſpirituall.
                  
                  Now, when the Apoſtle calleth our enimies, (Principalities,
powers, &c.) he doth not reckon vp diuers orders
and degrées of diuels: but he deſcribeth the power
of thoſe ſame enimies, by ſundrie names. For, when
he calleth diuels, by the name of 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is to ſaie,
(Principalities) and Empires, he doeth not onelie admoniſh
vs, that they are not enimies lightlie to be ſet by▪
as though they were not able to make anie power, or
had not in them ſtrength to reſiſt: but he alſo requireth
vs, to ſhake off their yoke, and caſt it from vs:
which we then doe, when we defie and forſake them, by
faith and truſt in Chriſt. For, they beare rule ouer
none, but ſuch, as of their owne accord, put their
neckes vnder the yoke, and are content to weare it▪
For, principalitie and ſubiection are correlatiues: that
is to ſaie, things of ſuch a qualitie, that where the one is,
the other muſt be.
                  Againe, when the Apoſtle calleth diuels 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     :



that is to ſaie, (Powers,) by which hée ſignifieth,
a right in ruling: which diuels execute and put in vre
ouer men, for ſinnes ſake, and that by Gods iuſt iudgment.
By this name therefore we are put in minde,
to flie from all and euerie ſinne, as béeing deliuered
from ſinne by and through Chriſt, leaſt the diuell
make claime to his right, and get rule ouer vs againe.
                  The name which followeth next, is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     :
that is to ſaie, rulers of the world: which ſignifieth, that
diuels haue the ouerſight and dealing in euill deedes onelie,
and that they hold them vnder their yoke, which
are intangled & caught with the baits of worldlie deſires.
For this word (World) doth not ſignifie in this place,
this goodlie frame and compaſſe, created of God, and furniſhed
with ſtore of all things, which God alone faſhioned
and made of his goodneſſe for man to liue in: but it
ſignifieth worldlie minded men, ſléeping in ſinne, and the
verie ſinnes themſelues: as plainlie is proued by the expoſition
following, when he defineth the world to be darkneſſe.
Now, it is commonlie knowne, that by darkneſſe,
the ignoraunce of God, and anie other ſinne whatſoeuer,
is meant. As therefore Chriſt ruleth and gouerneth
them, which are light: ſo the diuell pricketh forward,
and throweth headlong into all miſchiefe and villanie,
thoſe that are darkneſſe.
                  Laſtlie, when Saint Paule addeth theſe words:
(Againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſes, which are in the
high places,) he giueth vs thereby to note, the nature
of our enimies. For, they are ſpirituall enimies.
Thereby alſo he ſheweth vs, that they are ſwift and inuiſible:
by the former we are willed to take heed, becauſe
the daunger is great: by the latter to beware, becauſe
the ſnares and aſſaults are ſecreat. For, when our
enimies are inuiſible, they are about our ouerthrowe, euen
then, when we doe leaſt of all thinke it. We ought
therefore to bée preciſe and warie, leaſt we be ſet vpon,



ſooner than wée thinke.
                  Héereto ſerueth the word (Wickedneſſes,) whereby,
as the endeuour and order of diuels to deceiue is ſignified:
ſo are the godlie warned, continuallie to watch and
ward againſt ſo wicked and miſchieuous an enimie, who
will take no conditions of trace, nor enter into anie
league, vnleſſe we yéelde vp our ſelues wholie vnto his
power and rule, renouncing the faith of Chriſt.
Touching that which is added: to wit, (In the high or
heauenlie places:) it is diuerſlie expounded. Saint Ambroſe
vnderſtandeth the firmament of the world, by high
or heauenlie places: other ſome vnderſtand thereby, this
darke and miſtie aier: other vnderſtand by it, heauenlie
things: for which (ſaie they) is all this fighting and
ſkirmiſhing. For, this battell is taken in hand, not about
the kingdomes of the world, but about heauenlie
things. And ſurelie, although the matter be ſo indéed: yet
notwithſtanding, the plainer meaning is this: to wit,
that the place is noted from whence our enimies ſhall lay
load at vs. For, they ſet vpon vs from aloft, & are euen
vpon our neckes: in ſuch ſort, that they neuer reſt from
trieng of maſteries, no not the twinkling of an eie. This
therfore wherto ſerueth it? Euen to put vs in mind, how
doubtfull & dangerous an encounter it is, to come out &
wage battell with ſuch an enimie, who can, euen by the
nature of his place eaſilie ſet vpon vs, ſoone downe with
vs vnderfoote, & diſpatch vs with the turning of an hand.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 13.
                  
                  13 For this cauſe take vnto
you the whole armour of God,
that ye maie be able to reſiſt in
the euill daie, and hauing finiſhed
all things, ſtand faſt.
                  Take vnto you therefore the
whole armour of God, that ye
maie be able to reſist in the euill
daie, and ſtand faſt when
all things are finiſhed.
                  THis is a concluſion and repetition of the propoſition,
which is entered in this manner. The enimies



of the Church are mightie and malicious: therefore it is
méete, that Chriſtians, being furniſhed with the whole
armour, or complet harneſſe of God, ſet themſelues againſt
their enimies: at this time ſpeciallie, when all
things are full of doubts, troubles, and dangers. For, the
Apoſtle calleth the whole time of ſkirmiſhing, by the
name of (The euill daie:) which indéed is not euill of
it ſelfe, or by nature: but it is called euill, in reſpect of
the troubles and dangers which then doe chaunce. The
reaſon of the propoſition rehearſed, is verie full of comfort.
For, it promiſeth, that the children of God ſhall
certeinlie haue the victorie, if ſo be they hold out, and
abide the brunts ſtoutlie, vnder the banner of Chriſt.
For, when the Apoſtle ſaith, (And hauing finiſhed all
things, ſtand faſt,) he requireth labour in ſkirmiſhing,
without wearineſſe, and continuall conſtancie, euen
till the encounter be done: that is to ſaie, euen to the end
of this fraile life, after which ſhall followe a glorious triumph
ouer our enimies.
                  Out of this place of Saint Paule, our Auncients ſéeme
to haue taken the difference of the Church, calling one,
The Church militant: the other, The Church triumphant:
not that they are two ſundrie Churches: but becauſe
of the condition of the citizens of the ſame Church.
For, whiles we are in this life, our whole life is a kinde
of warfare againſt the fleſh, the world, and the diuell.
To this perteineth that ſaieng of Iob,
                     Iob. 7. 1. 2. 
                     Militia eſt vita noſtra
ſuper terram, Our life is a warfare vpon earth. But
when we ſhall depart out of this life, we ſhall be partakers
of Chriſts triumph, ſo that we ſhall be no more in
daunger of Sathans deadlie ſhot.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 14.
                  
                  14 Stand therefore, and your
loines girt about vvith veritie.
                  Stand therefore, and your loines
girded about with truth.
                  
                     
NOw followeth a declaration of the armour of God,
which Saint Paule would haue vs weare, againſt
the ſnares and aſſaults of the diuell: wherein (by the figures
Hypotypoſis, and Metaphora, he deſcribeth the
ſpirituall armour of our mindes, making an alluſion to
the armour of the ſouldiers of this world. And firſt of
all, the Apoſtle will haue vs gird vp our loines with
truth. What this ſhould meane ſhall ſoone appeare, when
the Metaphore is made more plaine. For, as the loines,
wherein the ſpeciall power & ſtrength of the bodie doth
lie, are girt vp with a girdle, leaſt the ſouldier in fighting
ſhould fall and miſcarrie: ſo the minde muſt be made
ſteddie & faſt, with the truth of God, leaſt the diuell laie
vs along the more eaſilie, and ſlaie vs the ſooner, when
hée findeth vs doubtfull, wauering, and inconſtant.
                  Let the minde therfore of a Chriſtian ſouldier, whiles
he is in this hot ſkirmiſh, bee firſt of all perſuaded of
Gods truth. Héereth ſerueth that ſaieng of our Lord in
the Goſpell:Luke. 12. 35. 
                     Sint lumbi veſtri, &c. Let your loines bee
girded about, & your lights burning. This ſpéech of our
Sauiour Chriſt, requireth as well conſtancie in doctrine,
as alſo innocencie in manners. And Saint Peter ſaith,
Praecincti lumbis,
                     1. Pet. 1. 13 
                     &c. Wherefore, gird vp the loines of
your minde: be ſober, and truſt perfectlie on the grace
that is brought vnto you, by the the reuelation of Ieſus
Chriſt.

                  14 And hauing on the breſt
plate of righteouſneſſe.
                  VVearing on the breſt plate of
righteouſneſſe.
                  HEere the breſt is defended. For, as the breſt plate
defendeth the breſt of a wordlie ſouldier, ſo innocencie
of life, or righteouſneſſe, defendeth a mans minde, and
ſo harneſſeth it, that the weapons of the diuell haue no



power to pearſe vnto the heart, and to quench the religion
of Chriſt, there abiding.

the preparation of the Goſpell
of peace.
                  Your feet ſhod with the preparation
of the Goſpell of peace.
                  AS ſouldiers defend their féet, to the end they maie bée
ſafe, when they are going to battell: ſo it behoueth
Chriſtian ſouldiers to be ſhod with the Goſpell: to the
intent they maie holde out ſtoutlie in ſkirmiſh, not being
once harmed. For this worde (Preparation,) the
Greekes vſe, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , whereby is ſignified a certeine
readineſſe and chéerfulneſſe, wherewith the faithfull doe
embrace the Goſpell of peace. The Genitiue caſe (Pacis,
of peace) hath the place of an Epitheton, or Adiectiue:
and vnder the name of (Peace,) the fruit of the Goſpell
is meant. For, the Goſpell is a proclamation touching
the attonement and reconciliation betwéene God & vs.
               
               
                  
                     Verſe. 16.
                  
                  16 Aboue all, take the ſhield
of faith, vvherewith yee maie
quench all the fierie darts of
the vvicked.
                  Aboue all things, taking vnto you
the ſhield of faith, wherewith ye
maie be able to put out all the
darts of the wicked.
                  AS the whole bodie is defended and ſaued with the
ſhield, that it maie be kept ſafe from blowes, and
wounds: ſo an ardent and vndoubted faith kéepeth and
defendeth the minde euerie where from hauing hurt. And
as the ſhield is held out, to beare off the darts & ſtrokes
of our enimies weapons: ſo a true faith ought to be
ſet againſt all kinde of temptations. Touching this matter,
there are more examples rehearſed in the Epiſtle to
the Hebrewes. The Apoſtle calleth deadlie darts, (Fierie
darts:) by the figure Metalepſis. For he alludeth to the



faſhion and dealing of warriours, who in olde time,
beſméered the heads of their dartes with poiſon, that the
bodies of the wounded might ſo bée inflamed, as that it
ſhould not be poſſible to heale them, and make them
ſound againe.

                  17 And take the helmet of
ſaluation.
                  And take the helmet of health,
(or ſaluation.)
                  AS the head béeing defended with an helmet, is ſafe:
ſo hope of ſaluation to come, muſt be ſet flat againſt
euerie aſſault of the diuell. For, from this hope ſpringeth
moſt abundant comfort in all aduerſities. It is called
(The helmet of ſaluation,) by the figure Metonymia:
to wit,1. Theſ. 5. 8. becauſe it ſaueth harmeleſſe. This helmet of
ſaluation, our Apoſtle calleth by the name of hope, in his
Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians.

                  17 And the ſword of the ſpirit,
vvhich is the vvord of God. is
                  
                  And the ſword of the ſpirit, which
Gods word.
                  THus farre the Apoſtle hath armed a Chriſtian ſouldier,
with thoſe weapons and harneſſe, wherewith
hée maie ſafelie withſtand the aſſaultes of the diuell.
Now he deliuereth him in hand a ſword, with
the which hée maie ſet vpon his enimie, and driue him
backe. And becauſe the enimie is ſpirituall, it is conuenient,
that the ſword alſo be ſpirituall, wherewith
hée maie be put to flight: euen the ſame ſword,
which the Lorde himſelfe ſmote Sathan withall,
and made him take his héeles, when he preſumed
to tempt and encounter with Chriſt.Math. 4. 1 2. 3, &c. This is the
ſword of the Lordes owne mouth, wherewith hée



ſlaieth the vngodlie. For, ſo often as we giue the diuell
the foile, by the word of the Lord, he is laid along with
the ſword of the Lords owne mouth.
                  But héede muſt be had héere, leaſt we be entangled in
the error of the Papiſts, & embrace the letter for the ſpirit.
For, the words of the Apoſtle are not meant of anie
ſorcerous rehearſall of words, or of the caſt of coniuring,
ſpoken & done according to the words ſpecified (as though
there were ſome forceableneſſe in the ſound of the words,
beſides that which it hath by the ordinance & appointment
of God:) neither are they meant of the writing of
the words, and the hanging of them about our necke:
(as they thought, the beginning of Saint Iohns Goſpell,
written in fine parchment, and hanged about ones
necke, to be the ſame ſwords of the ſpirit, which S. Paule
ſpeaketh of in this place.) But the word of God, then:
yea, euen then, is the ſpirituall ſword, when it is forceable
in vs by faith, and when it is written in the tables
of our heart, by the ſpirit of God. For then in déede this
ſword is fit, and ſerueth well, for the defacing and diſpatching
of our aduerſarie the diuell.
                  Héerehence it appeareth, how cruell a tyrant Antichriſt
of Rome is, who beſtirres him all that he maie, to
take from Gods people this ſword of the ſpirit: not onlie
by falſifieng & wreſting the Scripture to a contrarie and
vnnaturall meaning: but alſo by making lawes, that it
ſhould not be ſet forth in a common and knowne tongue,
for the behoofe of Gods Church, that euerie one might
read and vnderſtand it.

                  Praieng alwaies in ſpirit, with
all manner of praier and ſupplication:
and watching to
this end, with all continuance

THe Apoſtle hauing furniſhed the Chriſtian ſouldier,
with double armour, bringeth him vnto his Captaine,
to march ſtoutlie and manfullie vnder his banner:
and if the ſkirmiſh bée too daungerous, to flie for ſuccour
vnto his Captaine, leaſt he be ouertroden of his
mightie and ſtrong enimie. For, by praier we come to
Chriſt our Captaine: prouided alwaies, that this praier
be not a babbling with the lips: but a lifting vp of the
heart in faith vnto God, ioined with a deuout ſound of the
mouth, all béeing done with a ſure tr
                        •••
                     , and confidence
in Chriſt our mediatour.
                  
                     Now, what it is to praie in ſpirit, Saint Ambroſe
ſheweth by a verie trimme antitheſis or oppoſition, in
theſe words: Hoc eſt ergo, &c. This is therefore to praie
alwaies in ſpirit, euen to make our praiers vnto God,
with a cleane conſcience, and an vpright faith. For, hee
praieth in the fleſh, which praieth with a defiled mind.
Thus farre hée.
                  
                  As for that which is added: to wit, (For all Saints, &
for me,) it ſerueth to this end, that the endeuour of ſuccouring
and aſſiſting one an other in this ſpirituall warfare,
might bée commended vnto vs. For, we ought to
vſe theſe two weapons: namelie, (The ſword of the ſpirit,)
and (Praier,) not onelie in defence of our ſelues:
but alſo for the helping and aiding of others, ſpeciallie,
when we ſée them in danger. And although we muſt
praie for all men: yet notwithſtanding, we muſt haue
principall care and regard to the Saints: that is to ſaie,
to them that are ioined with vs by faith and loue, béeing
in déede members of one, and the ſame myſticall bodie, as
well as we.
                  Touching the words of the Apoſtle laſt ſet downe:
(And for me,) they put the godlie in minde of their duetie:
which is, to praie continuallie for the miniſters of
Gods word, and for the preſeruation and maintenance of
their miniſterie.

                     19 That vtterance maie bee
giuen vnto me, that I maie open
my mouth boldlie, to publiſh
the ſecret of the Goſpell,
                     20 Whereof I am the Ambaſſadour
in bonds, that therein
I maie ſpeake boldlie, as I
ought to ſpeake.
                  
                  That ſpeech maie be giuen me,
in the opening of my mouth,
with boldneſſe, that I maie vtter
(or declare) the myſterie of
the Goſpell, whereof I beare
ambaſſage in chaines, that I
maie behaue my ſelfe boldlie
therein, a sit becommeth me to
ſpeake.
                  THe cauſes whie Saint Paule deſireth the Epheſians to
praie for him, are ſet downe, & they are thrée in number.
The firſt, (That he might open his mouth boldlie:)
that is to ſaie, that a conſtant mind might be giuen vnto
him, whereby to confeſſe and profeſſe the doctrine of the
Goſpell, without feare, before the whole world. For, he
calleth the opening of the mouth, a frée confeſſion of doctrine,
ſimple, plaine, cléere, without diſſembling, counterfeiting,
and cauilling, without feare, and doubting to
diſpleaſe, which often times doth ſo ſhut vp and make faſt
the mouthes of a great manie, as they remember not,
that it is the ambaſſage of Chriſt Ieſus, which they haue
in charge.
                  Héere all the godlie, and ſpeciallie the miniſters of
Gods word, are admoniſhed, what boldneſſe of confeſſion
ought to be in them: to wit, that no feare, no heauineſſe,
no threatenings, no torments make them giue ouer:
but that they maie teach and preach the Goſpell with a
courage.
                  The ſecond cauſe is, (That I ſhould publiſh the
ſecret of the Goſpell.) For, this is peculiar to Paule,
and the miniſters of the word, that by preaching, euen
with their owne voice, they ſhould publiſh the ſecret of
the Goſpell. This place therefore is at defiance with
the Anabaptiſts, who coutemning the worde vttered by
voice, looke for reuelatious, viſions, inſpirations, and
I wot not what. But what is that which is added.
