realmes dominions and ſubiectes Protector, and others of his moſte honorable counſaill, for the repreſſyng of certain Sedicious and Diſobedient perſones.
            
               WHereas vpon credible informacion of ſundry decaies of houſes and encloſures,
made by diuerſe perſones contrary to the Kynges Maieſties
lawes and ſtatutes of this realme: His highnes by the aduiſe of his dereſt
vncle, the Lorde Protector, and others of his maieſties priuie counſaill,
myndyng a gentle reformacion of theſame, gaue warnyng by Proclamacion
to the offendors, to redreſſe and amende their offences in that
behalf, before a certain daie, entendyng after theſaied warnyng, to haue
executed his highnes ſaid lawes and ſtatutes ſharpely againſt ſuche as
notwithſtandyng theſaied warnyng, would haue continued in their ſaied offence: Beeyng enformed that
certain nombers of diſobedient and ſedicious perſones, aſſemblyng theimſelfes together vnlawfully, in
ſome partes of the realme, haue moſte arrogantly and diſloyally vnder pretence of theſaied Proclamaciō,
taken vpon theim his Maieſties aucthoritie, preſumed to plucke his highnes ſworde, out of his hande,
and ſo gone about to chaſtice and correct, whom thei haue thought good: in pluckyng doune Pales, Hedges,
and Ditches, at their will and pleaſure, contrary to their dueties of allegeaunce, and to the daunger
of his maieſtie, and al other his highnes good and louyng ſubiectes. Like as his Maieſtie, by the aduiſe
and counſaill aforeſaied, hath reſolued to take ſuche ordre for the one partie, as theſaied decaies and encloſures

                reformed accordyng to his maieſties lawes.
ſtatutes: And on the other parte, theſe outragious attemptates, of theſaied ſedicious and leude perſones,
ſtaied, corrected, and puniſhed, accordyng to iuſtice, for the more ſuretie of his highnes, good and louyng
ſubiectes, ſo hath his Maieſtie thought good, to will, charge, and commaunde, like as by theſe preſentes,
his maieſtie doth ſtraightly charge and cōmaunde, all and ſynguler his highnes good ſubiectes, of what
eſtate, degree, or condiciō ſoeuer thei be, not onely to beware how thei preſume, at any tyme frō hencefurth
to make any ſuche riottes, or vnlawful aſſēbles, for any cauſe whatſoeuer, vpon pain of his highnes vtter
indignacion, and as thei will auoyde the extremitie and vttermoſte perill, that maie enſue for the contrary:
But alſo, aſſone as by any meanes, thei ſhall haue any certain knowlege, intelligence, or vehement
ſuſpicion, of any ſecrete or open conſpiracie, or vnlawfull aſſembly of any multitude, either for the breakyng
doune of Hedges, Paies, Ditches, or encloſures, or for any other vnlawfull purpoſe whatſoeuer,
that in euery ſuche cace, thei and euery of theim, hauyng any knowlege, or vehement ſuſpicion, as is aforeſaied,
faile not with aſmuche ſpede, as he or thei poſſibly maie, to geue notice and informacion, to the
next Iuſtice of Peace, for the more ſpedy ſtate, and repreſſyng thereof.
            And his highnes further pleaſure is, that if any perſone or perſones (this the declaracion of his maieſties
pleaſure notwithſtandyng) ſhall preſume (as his Maieſtie truſteth none will) to make any the like
ſedicion, aſſembles, routes, or riottes, that the Sherief, and Iuſtices of Peace in euery Shire, within this
his highnes realme, and euery of them ſhall not onely extend their forces, with all their poſſible diligence,
for the ſtate therof, as is aforeſaid, but alſo, that thei and euery of thē, faile not to proſecute by the ſworde,
and with all force and extremitie, all ſuche offendors: and alſo, when thei ſhalbe departed from their houſes,
to any aſſembly for any ſuche vnlawfull purpoſe, to ſpoyle and rifle their houſes and goodes to their
vtter ruyne and diſtruccion, and the terrible example of others: ſtraightly chargyng and commaundyng
all Maiors, Bailiefes, Hedborewes, Conſtables, and all other his maieſties officers, miniſters, true and
faithfull ſubiectes, that thei and euery of them, be aidyng and aſſiſtyng, to theſaid Sheriefes and Iuſtices,
and to euery of them in and aboute the execucion of the premiſſes, as thei will auoyde his Maieſties
indignacion, and impriſonment duryng his highnes pleaſure, without baill or mainpriſe, and make further
aunſwere at their vttermoſte perill.
            And yet his maieſtie doth his highnes good and louyng ſubiectes to vnderſtand, that if any of them
do or ſhall ſuffer any wrong or
