And vpon this poynte, I wyll ceſſe frome lenger to fynde the cōmunicatiō, to take away from the thoccaſyō more timportune me thynkynge to tourne my voyage. And therfore my ſuſter ſpeake not to me therof at any tyme herafter, wherfore after I was hole of my woundes I went, to the kynge whom I prayed to gyue an huſbande to my ſuſter, whiche he promyſed me to do. And after that in this caſe, his wyll and my deſyre were executed, I was greatlye importuned by hym vpon the delaye of myne enterpryſe. But for ſomoche as his wyll was contrarie, and diſcor daunte to myne intention, we taried in cōtraryete of opinion leuenge hym aſſured of my departure, whereof he

was ſo dyſpleaſed, that he wolde not gyue me lycence, but puttynge backe all thynges ſpecyally the wepynges, and lamentacyons of my dere ſuſter. After many farewellys and enbraſemētes of my frendes I toke my iourney, wherof the kynge beynge aduertyſed wolde with his gentyluiē do me ſomoche honoure as to conducte me out of the Cytye. But bycauſe yt with out to moleſte the, I can not declare to the the matyers that than paſſed betwene vs. I am content to concele them.

deſyred more that I ſholde lyue the reſt of my dayes amonges ye beaſtes brute, than among creatures reaſonable, albeit that theyr condytours be entyerly differēt from ours.
