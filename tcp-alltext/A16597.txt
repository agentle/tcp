            HE, that generallie readeth the hiſtories, not oneli of the old auncient Philoſophers but alſo of al writers in theſe daies, ſhal eaſely perceiue and vnderſtand, that the moſt hard and difficill thīge of al other is, for any mortal man to wythſtande the inuincible force of nature, who as we ſee dayly endeuoreth her ſelfe to the verye houre of death, to ouercome mans witte, reaſon and force. For althogh we be encouraged earneſtlye, by our maſter and ſauyoure Chryſt, with the hope of perpetuall pleaſures, and the perfyte beliefe of euerlaſtinge lyfe, to leaue theſe vayne, folyſhe and moſt vncerteine deſiers or delectacions of thys moſt wretched world, and boldely, without feare, to paſſe through the ports of death, out of this vile,

caducke,If nature be of ſuch ſtrength, neuer thinke that Spaniardes can chāg their vile nature. and moſt tranſytorye life: yet ye ſee, that nature is of ſuch a mightie power, in her moſte ouerthwart operacions, that al manlines, all force, ſtrength, power, riches, honor, wiſdome, and knowledge not with ſtanding, ſhe compelleth all mē generallye to feare death, to reſiſte death and to flye from that porte, throug
                  •
                the whiche we ſhould paſſe to euerlaſting life, and eternall felicite. I meane that like as nature forceably compelleth vs, contrarye to all reaſon, to reſiſte death, for the vtter moſte of oure power, when by no meanes we can eſcape or flie from it: Euen ſo nature cōpelleth me, being an Engliſhe mā, for the natural loue which I beare towardes my countrye, to take vpon me contrary to al wiſedome, if I would ſeke mine own priuate ſafetye, to declare the nature of ſpaniardes, ct diſcouer their moſt vile, and deteſtable treaſons, whiche by no meanes I can deuiſe to expres

plaīly, or to bryng to any perfect end and good order, becauſe their moſte curſed condicions be ſo vncerteyne and notable. But although I can not expreſſe my maters, either wittelye, eloquently or learnedlye, yet I ſhall deſier thee, moſte gētile reader: al rethoricall writinge, and eloquent ſtile layde a parte, to haue an earneſt reſpecte to the perfecte grounde of the matter: whiche is either the preſeruacion, or deſtruction of the whole realme. The preſeruaciō of the land, if all Engliſhe men wil loue charitably, faithfully, truly, and Iuſtly together, and euery one from the hygheſt degree, to the loweſte, ſeke, as we ar moſt bounden, ſtoutly, boldelye and iuſtly, to defende his natiue countri, and without feare manfully to wyth ſtande, and reſiſt the fallible force, of our enemyes. The deſtructiō of our moſt noble kingedome, if one part of our nobilite and commons doe reſiſt another, and treaterouſli receaue our enemyes, aſſiſt them, aide them,

And finally if there fall amongeſt Engliſhe men diſſenſion, ſtrife, treaſon, ſedicion or rebellion: the whole realme ſhalbe deſtroyed, and all englyſhe men brought to perpetuall bondage and ſlauery: yea the firſt, chefe, and principall workers of theſe miſcheffes, how many ſo euer they be, ſhall be brought to the moſt ſhameful death as thou maieſt plainly perceiue in reding this letter that foloweth. In the firſt parte of the whiche letter, thou ſhalt finde ſuche examples, as if thou diligentlye peruſe and folowe, according to my exhortacion and doctrine,

thou ſhalt finde out eaſely a million and moe miſcheues touchynge the vile nature of Spaniardes, then I haue plainly expreſſed in writinge: In the ſeconde part I haue diſcouered ſuche treaſons, as I founde written in their letters. And I declare theyr wordes, whereby thou mayeſt plainly perceaue, to what purpoſe al their flattering promiſes, craftye polices, great giftes and large bribes, be pretēted: and how it appeareth playnly, by their own wordes and letters, that they pretende none other thing but only to bryng our countrye vnder their ſubiectiō, & then to bring all our nobilitie to their vtter confuſion and deſtruction.

One thinge I haue thought neceſſary to admoniſh the in, good reder, becauſe I am but yonge, and a ſeruyng man, continuallye brought vp in ſeruice, without all knowledge, or learnyng, and am at this preſent among Spaniardes, where I can haue the aduiſe of no lerned

Yet though we doe al thys, we cannot iuſtifie oure ſelues, becauſe we can not fulfill the lawe.

The Spaniardes wold ended this or you ſhold vnderſtode it & therfore now denye it. before ye know them, and your head ſhall perhaps pay for the firſt. My lord of Darby ſhal perceiue, that nother he, nor his ſonne ſhal liue long after the kīg is crownd. The Erle of Shreuſbery may well perceiue they flatter hym ſhamefully, when they goe about to deſtroy the noble lord Talbot. I am ſorie that my lord of arundell hath eſcaped ſo many treaſons as haue beē inuented beefore agaynſt him, and ſhall now be diſceaued and deſtroied amongſt vile, treaterous, and moſte falſe flattering Spaniardes. And yet I am ſory that the realme ſhould be robbed of ſo wiſe, ſo noble and ſo manlike a gentell man, as the Lorde matreues his only ſonne: do ye thīke theſe thinges wil not come to paſſe or doe ye beleue, I haue not told you trueth, or truſte you to liue ſtyll in your countre: ye vndoubtedlye my lords, they dare not ſuffer you. The

reaſon is this, thei ſay, that nacion & thoſe men, that will woorke treaſon and be falſe traitours to, and againſt their own naturall kynge and countrey, the ſame men ſo ſone as they be agreued, and beginne to ſmart, will woorke treaſons againſte them, and their king: but theſe thinges may be wrought in their time.
            Ye thinke I ſpeake my pleaſure, but I aſſure you moſt truely I wryte nothinge of ſuſpeccion, nor blinde iudgemente, but thoſe things, which I haue ſeene and proued perfectlye and that be moſte ſurely pretended and will vndoubtedly be wrought, if ye take no better counſell to withſtand them. Marke my lordes if theſe bee well gotten goodes, that ſhalbe the deſtruccion of you, & your countrey for euer: doe ye not encreſe your rentes properly, when ye ſeke the loſſe of your liues, and children, without remedy: be not thoſe bribes dere bought that bring with thē the ruine and the ſubuerſion of youre

So my lord Darbes ſōnes title to the croun by hys wife will coſt al iii. their life the bondage of the lande, the ſuppreſſion of the cōmen wealth the beggerie of al the quens ſubiects, the loſſe of our liberte, the death of our nobilite, the perdicion of al oure rentes, lāds, goods and childrē, theſe thinges I haue found in their letters bu

And folowe youre lordſhips, for the preſeruacion of youre lyues, honor and children, this worthy and notable example of the moſt worthy king Codrus, who ſeing his countrey aſſauted, by the moſt cruell tiranny of his enemies, ſought by all meanes poſſible to deliuer his people from bondage, with leaſt deſtruccion of his ſubiectes bloud: and being anſwered that there was no way to preſerue his realme, except he himſelfe ſhould be ſlaine, appareled hys moſt princelike perſon in a poore palmers wede, and after great lamentacion of

but al the world can not expell her ſo much, but ſhe returnth in ſhort ſpace. what deueliſhe nature is this, that no man can ſuffer: the time is ſhorte, or els I wold tel you much more: their pride is of ſuch nature, that ſhe can ſuffer no man, to be felow with her.The nature of Spani. Pride would euer be the higheſt, and then who hath more pride then Spaniardes, who canne beare rule aboue thē.Doubteles I know no man can ſet forth more myſery, then the peo / ple be in in Naples and if ye go forth; ye ſhal come to the lyke. The Spaniardes denie not them ſelues to be the proudeſt and moſte lecherous men liuing, and can they then be without all other vices, ſeeing pride is the roote of al ſinne, and the mother of all miſchiefe. Their hartes wil boile and borſt, to ſee any nacion nere about them proſper in welth and tranquilite. I heare ſaye there be certeine bokes amongſt you whiche in dede I neuer ſawe, as the lamentacion of Naples: the mourninge of Millane, and ſuche other, which haue ſhowed you the tiranny that Spaniardes haue vſed in other

For when the king is crowned, who dare withſtand his doings doe not the lawes of Englande bind al men to obeie him: but ſeing thei vnderſtande not our lawe, maye not the kinge chaunge it, as ſhall ſeeme good for him, by the aduiſe of his coū

Yf ye read the enchiridiō of Eraſmus in the leafe,Eraſmus. lxxv. ye ſhall finde that the Quenes highnes or any other Prince,VVhat the quene oughte to doe. that wil folowe goddes commaundement and ſeke the kingdom of heauen, ought not to make any lawes or ſtatutes agaynſte the commen wealth of her countr, and that ſhe ought not to doe that, which ſhe may by her power, but that which ſhe maye doe iuſtlye by the lawes of the realme.A trewe example For lyke as Chriſte was not borne for himſelfe, nor died not for himſelfe, but was borne to fulfil the

law, liued to teache vs the perfecte trueth of the law, and died to redeme al thoſe that woulde folow his ſteps and kepe his commaundementes: euē ſo the Quene ought not to do that thing which is for her own profet, her own pleaſure or her own pryuat commodite but that which is for the commodite of the whole countrey, the profite of her poore people, and the ſtrength, aide, preſeruacion, and the comfort of the whole realme.How the Quene ought to gouerne vs Her grace ought not to gouerne vs if ſhe wil folowe Chriſte, but to ſe vs gouerned vprightly in all ſpirituall maters after gods worde, and in all temporall maters accordinge to the lawes of the realme iuſtlye, for oure preſeruacion

and folowe it in this caſe. But if the Quenes grace wil not ſeke to winne heauen, with folowing Chriſte and keping his order, for the commodite and profet of all her people, then ſhe muſt without grace, in breakeynge Chriſts order, and leauing his ſteps, without any ſeconde way folow the ſteps of the deuill, and ſo ſeking her owne priuat commodite, her owne wil & her own pleaſure, rūne ſtraight headlong to hell. Mary if the Quene be the laſt heire, ſo that the crown remaine wholly, perfectly and lawfully in her, without any other diſcente, ſhe may by gods lawe geue it for the commen wealth of her ſubiects and the realme, where or to whom ſoeuer pleaſeth her, and then if it be for the commen wealth of the realme, as ye ſe plainly it is not, ſhe mai geue it to her graces huſbande the kinge: but if it belong to the heires of the realme, after her death, and if ther be any heires in Englande liuing after

Yf ye could reſtore it againe afterwardes, and ſo make them recompence, ſhe myghte haue pardon of god: but I am ſure the Quenes grace, and all her honorable counſell, haue ſeene the kinges ſtyle where he writeth himſelfe kinge of xxviii kingdomes, with Englande, Fraunce, and Yrelande, and there ye perceue, that he leaueth out the quen in all his writinges and deades, whatſoeuer he maketh or confirmth.

               The Spaniards hath ſworne vs to defēd,
               So that we betraye Englande to them:
               Make hauock now the people to ſpend,
               
                  As Herode did once in Bethleem.

               Their hart is driuen into their hoſe.

               If we draw backe our kingdom wil fal,
               If we be ſtoute nothing ſhal vs faile

               Beare out al matters be they vntrew:
               Say trew men be traitors & the Qu. foe,
               Baniſh al trueth and falſhode renewe.

               Our iuſt muſt we haue, who can ſai nay,
               This god once ſaid to our father Caine,
               
                  The world is our reigne & worldli ſtaie,
               VVe ſhal not decaye but alwais remaīe.

               The authour to Englande his naturall countreye.
               England repent whiles thou haſt ſpace,
               If thou couldeſt repent as Niniuie did,
               Then ſholdeſt thou be ſure of gods grace
               And ſo might thy enemies quite be rid.
               But if thou be blinde and wilt not ſee,
               Thē haſteth deſtructiō for to deſtroi the.
            
            FINIS.
