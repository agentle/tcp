               MADAME, ACCORDING to your request I haue p
                  •
               rused your studious labour of trāslatiō profitably imploied in a right cōmendable work. Whereof for that it liked you to make me a Iudge, and for that the thinge it selfe hath singularly pleased my iudgement, and delighted my mind in reading it, I haue right heartely to thanke your Ladi

               ship, both for youre owne well thinking of me, and for the comforte that it hathe wrought me. But far aboue these priuate respectes, I am by greater causes enforced, not onely to shewe my reioyse of this your doinge, but also to testify the same by this my writing prefixed before the work, to the commoditie of others, and good incouragement of your selfe. You haue vsed your accustomed modestie in submittinge it to iudgement, but therin is your

prayse doubled, sith it hath passed iudgemēt without reproche. And whereas bothe the chiefe author of the Latine worke and I, seuerallye perusinge and conferringe youre whole translation, haue without alteration allowed of it, I must bothe desire youre Ladiship, and aduertise the readers, to thinke that wee haue not therein giuen any thinge to any dissemblinge affection towards you, as beinge contented to winke at faultes to please you, or to make you without cause to please your selfe: for there be sundry respectes to drawe vs from so doinge, althoughe we were so euil minded, as there is no cause why we should be so thought of. Your own iudgement in discerning flatterie, your modestie in mislikinge it, the layenge open of oure opinion to the world, the truth of our friendship towardes you, the vnwillingnesse of vs bothe (in respecte of our vocations) to haue this publike worke not truely and wel translated, are good causes to perswade, that our allowance is of sincere truth and vnderstanding: By which your trauail (Madame) you haue expressed an acceptable dutye to the glorye of GOD, deserued well of this

Churche of Christe, honourablie defended the good fame and estimation of your owne natiue tongue, shewing it so able to contend with a worke originally written in the most praised speache: and besides the honour ye haue done to the kinde of women and to the degree of Ladies, ye haue done pleasure to the Author of the Latine boke, in deliueringe him by your cleare translation from the perrils of ambiguous and doubtful constructions: and in makinge his good woorke more publikely beneficiall: wherby ye haue raysed vp great comforte to your friendes, and haue furnished your owne conscience ioyfully with the fruit of your labour, in so occupienge your time: whiche must needes redounde to the encoragemente of noble youth in their good educatiō, and to spend their time and knowledge in godly exercise, hauinge deliuered them by you so singular a president. Whiche youre doinge good Madame, as God (I am sure) doth accept and will blesse with increase, so youre and ours moste vertuous and learned soueraigne Ladie and Mastres shal see good cause to commende: and all noble gentlewomen shall

(I trust) hereby be alured from vain delights to doinges of more perfect glory. And I for my part (as occasion may serue) shal exhort other to take profit by your worke, and followe your example: whose successe I beseche our heauenly father to blesse and prospere. And now to thende bothe to acknowledge my good approbatiō, and to spread the benefit more largely, where you Ladishippe hathe sent me your boke writen, I haue with most hearty thankes returned it to you (as you see) printed: knowing that I haue therin done the beste, and in this poynte vsed a reasonable pollicye: that is, to preuent suche excuses as your modestic woulde haue made in staye of publishinge it. And thus at this time I leaue furder to trouble youre good Ladishippe.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            An Apologie or aunswere in defence of the Church of England, with a briefe and plaine declaration of the true Religion professed and used in the same.
            
               IT HATH BEEN AN olde complaint, euen from ye first time of ye Patriarks & Prophetes, and confirmed by the writinges and testimonies of euery age,Tertull. in Apologetico. that ye Truth wandereth here and there as a straunger in the world, & doth redily fynde enemies and slaunderers amongst those that knowe her not. Albeit perchaunce this may seeme vnto some a thinge harde to bee beleeued, I meane to suche as haue scante well and narowly taken heed thereunto, specially seing all mankind of natures very motion without a teacher doth coueite the truth of their owne accorde: and seinge oure Sauioure Christe hym selfe, when

he was on earthe woulde bee called the Truthe, as by a name moste fytte to expresse all hys diuine power: yet wee, whiche haue been exercised in the holie scriptures, and which haue bothe redde & seene what hath happened to all godly menne commonly at all tymes, what to the Prophets, to the Apostles, to the holie Martyres, and what to Christe hym selfe, with what rebukes, reuilings and dispightes they were continually vexed whyles they heere lyued, and that onely for the truthes sake: wee (I saye) do see, yt this is not onely no newe thinge or harde to be beleued, but that it is a thing already receaued and commonlye vsed from age to age. Nay truly, this might seeme muche rather a meruayle and beyonde all beleife, yf the Diuell, who is the Father of lyes and ennemye to all truthe,
                  Iohn. 8. woulde nowe vppon a sodaine chaunge his nature, and hope that truthe might otherwyse be suppressed, then by belyenge yt: Or that he would

beginne to establishe his owne kingdom by vsing now any other practises, then the same whiche he hathe euer vsed from the beginning. For since any mans remembraunce, wee cen

               e skante finde one time, either when Religion did first growe, or when it was setled, or when it did a freshe springe vp againe, wherin truth and innocencye were not by all vnworthy meanes and most despit

               ully intreated. Doubtlesse the Dyuell well seeth, that so longe as truth is in good sauery, hym selfe cannot be safe, nor yet maintaine his owne estate.
            For lettinge passe the auncient patriarkes and Prophetes, who, as we sayd, had no parte of their lyfe free from contumelies and slaunders. Wee knowe there were certaine in tymes past, whiche said & commonly preached, that the old aūcient Iewes (of whom we make no doubt but thei wer the worshippers of the onely and true God) did worshipp

                and that all the same Religion was nothinge els, but a sacriledge and a plaine contempt of all godlynes. We know also that the sonne of God, our Sauioure Iesu Christe,
                  Mar. 11.
                when hee taughte the truthe, was coumpted a Iugler and an enchanter, a Samaritan, Belzebub, a deceiuer of the people, a dronkard, and a Glutton. Againe, who wotteth no

                what woordes were spoken agaynste Sainct Paule the most earnest and vehement preacher and maintainour of ye truth? Somtime that he was a sedi

               ous and busy man, a raiser of tumultes, a causer of rebellion: somtime againe that he was an heretique, sometime yt he was mad: Somtime that onely vppon strife and stomacke he was bothe a blasphemer of Gods lawe, and a despiser of the Fathers ordinances. Further who knoweth not howe Sainct Stephan after he had throughly & sincerely embraced the truth, and beganne franklye

and stoutly to preache and set forthe the same as he ought to do, was immediatlye called to aunswere for his life, as one that had wickedly vtered disdain
                  •
               ul and haynous wordes against the lawe, against Moyses, against the Temple, and against God? Or who is ignorant that in tymes past there werre some which reproued the holye Scriptures of falsehood, saying they conteined thinges both contrary and quite one against an other:
                  Marcion ex Tertul. Aelius è Lactantio.
                and howe that the Apostles of Christe did seuerallye disagree betwixt them selues, and that S. Paule did vary from them all? And not to make rehearsal of al, for that were an endles labour: who knoweth not after what sorte our Fathers were railed vpon in times past, which first began to acknowledge and professe the name of Christe,
                  Eusib. li. 5. cap 11. Tertull. in Apologe. 3. Idem. 1.2.3. & 7.8.9. howe they made priuat conspiracies, deuised secrete councels against the common welth, & to that end made earelie and priuie meetinges in the darke, kylled yonge babes,

fedd themselues wt mens fleshe, and lyke sauage and brute beastes, didde drinke their bloude? In conclusion, howe that after they had put out the candels, they committed adulterye betweene themselues, and without regarde wrought incest one with an other, that Brethren laie with their sisters, sonnes with their Mothers, without any reuerence of nature or kynne, without shame, without difference: and that thei wer wicked men without all care of Religion, and without anye opinion of God, being the very ennemies of mankinde, vnworthy to be suffered in the worlde, and vnworthie of lyfe?
            All these thinges wer spoken in those daies against the people of God, against Christ Iesu, against Paul, against Stephan, and against all them whosoeuer they were, which at the first beginninge imbraced the truthe of the Gospell, and were contented to be called by the name of Christians; which was then an hatefull

name amonge the common people. And although the thinges whiche they said, wer not true,
                  Tertull. in Apolo. cap. 3. yet the Diuel thought it shoulde be sufficient for him, yf at the least he coulde bringe i
                  •
                so to passe, as they might bee beleeued for true: and that the Christians might bee brought into a commō hatred of euery body, and haue their death and destruction sought of all sortes. Herevpon Kings and Princes beinge ledde then by suche perswasions, killed all the Prophetes of God, lettinge none escape: Esai with a sawe, Ieremy with stones, Daniell with Lyons, Amos with an yron barre, Paule with the sword, & Christ vpon ye crosse, and condemned all Christians to imprisonmentes, to tormentes to the pikes, to be thrwone doune headlong from rocks & stepe places, to be caste to wild beastes and to be burnt,
                  Suctoni in Tranquill. in Nerone.
                & made great syres of their quicke bodies, for ye only purpose to giue light by night, & for a very scorne & mockinge stocke: and didde compt them

no better then the vilest fylth, thofscouringes and laughing games of ye whole worlde. Thus (as ye see) haue the Authors and professours of the trueth euer ben entreated.
            Wherefore wee oughte to beare yt the more quyetlye, which haue taken vppon vs to professe the Gospell of Christ, yf we for the same cause be handled after the same sorte: and yf wee, as our forefathers weare longe ago, bee lykewyse at thys day tormented & bayted with raylings, with spitefull dealinges and with lyes, and that for no desert of our owne, but onely bicause we teach and acknowledge the truthe.
            They crye out vpon vs at thys present euery wheare, that we are all heretiques, and haue forsaken the fayth, and haue with newe perswasions and wicked learninge vtterly dyssolued the concorde of the Churche, that we renew, & as it weare, fetche againe from hell, the olde and many a daye condempned heresyes:

that we sow abroade newe sects, and suche broyles as neuer yearst weare hearde of: also that we are already deuided into contrarye partes and opinions, and coulde yet by no meanes agree well amonge oure selues: that wee be cursed creatures, & lyke ye Gyauntes do warre againste God him selfe, and lyue cleane without any regarde or worshippinge of God: that we despise all good deedes: that we vse noe discipline of vertue, no lawes, no customes: that we esteeme neither righte, nor order, nor equitie, nor iustice: that we geue ye brydell to al naugh tines, and prouoke the people to all lycenciousnes and lust: that we labour & seke to ouerthrowe the state of Monarchies and Kyngdomes, and to bringe al thinges vnder the rule of the rashe incō
               stante people and vnlearned multitude: that wee haue seditiously fallen from ye Catholique Churche, and by a wycked schisme and diuision haue shaken the whole worlde, and trobled the common

peace and vniuersal quiet of the church: and that as Dathan and Abyron conspired in times past against Moises and Aaron, euen so wee at this day haue renounced the Byshop of Rome without anye cause resonable: yt we set nought by the aucthoritie of thauncient fathers and Councels of oulde time: that wee haue rashly and presumptuously disanulled the olde cerimonies, which haue ben well alowed by oure fathers and forefathers manye hundreth yeare past, bothe by good customes and also in ages of more puritie: and that wee haue by our owne priuate head, without the aucthoritie of any sacred and general Councell brought new traditions into ye Church, and haue don all these thinges not for Religions sake, but only vppon a desyre of contention and stryfe.
            But that they for theyr parte haue chaunged no maner of thinge, but haue helde and kepte still suche a nomber of yeares to this verye day all thinges as

they were deliuered from the Apostles, and well approued by the most auncient Fathers.
            And that thys matter shoulde not seeme to be don but vppon priuie slaunder, and to be tossed to and fro in a corner, onely to spyte vs, there haue ben besides wy
                  •
               ely procured by the Bysshop of Rome, certaine parsons of eloquence yenough, and not vnlearned neyther, whiche shoulde put theyre helpe to thys cause now almost despaired of, & should polyshe and set furth the same, both in bookes and with long tales, to the end, that when the matter was trymlye and eloquently handled, ignorant and vnskilfull persons mighte suspecte there was som great thing in it. In deede they perceiued that their owne cause did euerye where go to wracke, that their sleightes were nowe espyed and lesse esteemed, & that their helpes did dayly fayle them, & that their matter stoode altogether in great neede of a conninge spokesman.

Now as for those things which by thē haue been layed against vs, in part they be manifestly false & condempned so by their owne iudgementes whiche spake thē, partly again, though thei be as false to in deede, yet beare thei a certain shew and colour of truth, so as the Reader (if he take not good hede) may easily be tripped and brought into errour by them, specially when their fine and cunninge tale is added thereunto: and part of them be of suche sorte, as wee oughte not to shunne them as crimes or faultes, but to acknowledg & professe them as thinges well done, and vpon very good reason.
            For shortely to say the truth, these folke falsely accuse and slaunder all oure doinges: yea the same thinges whiche they themselues can not deny but to be rightly and orderly don, and for malice do so misconstre and depraue al our sayinges and doinges, as though it were impossible, yt any thinge could be rightly

spokē or don by vs. They should more plainly & sincerely haue gon to worke if thei would haue dealt truely, but now they neither truelye nor sincerelye: nor yet Christianly, but darklye and craftely charge and batter vs with lyes, and doe abuse the blindenes & fondenes of the people, together with the ignoraunce of Princes, to cause vs to be hated, and the truth to be suppressed.
            This, lo ye, is the power of darkenes, and of men which leane more to the amased wondering of the rude multitude and to darknes, then they doe to ye truth and light: and as S. Hierome saieth, which doe openly gain say the truth, closing vp their eyes, and wil not se for the nonce. But wee giue thankes to the most good & mighty God, yt such is our cause, wher against (whē they woulde faynest) they were able to vtter no dispite, but the same which might aswell bee wrested againste the holye Fathers, against the Prophetes, against the Apostles,

against Peter, against Paule, and against Christ himselfe.
            Nowe therefore, if it be lee
                  •
               ull for these folkes to be eloquent and fine tonged in speaking euil, surely it becōmeth not vs in our cause, being so very good, to be dumme in answering truelye. For men to be carelesse what ys spoken by them and their own matter bee it neuer so falselye and slaunderouselye spoken, (especiallie when it is suche, yt the Maiestie of God and the cause of religiō may therby be dammaged) is the part doubtles of dissolute and retcheles persons, & of them which wickedlye winke at the iniuries don vnto the name of God. For although other wrōges, yea oftentimes great, may be borne and dissembled of a milde & Christiā man, yet hee that goeth smothelye awaye and dissembleth the mater when he is noted of heresy, Ruffinus was wont to deny that man to be a Christian. We therefore will do the same thinge which all lawes, which natures

owne voyce doth command to be don, and whiche Christe him selfe did in like case when he was checked and reuiled, to the intent we may put of from vs these mens slaunderous accusations, and may defend soberly and truely our own cause and innoncencie.
            For Christ verelye when the Pharysies charged him with sorcery as one yt had some familiar Spirites, & wrought many thinges by their helpe, I saide he, haue not the Dyuell, but do 
                  •
               e glorifie my Father: but it is you, that haue dishonored me, and put me to rebuke and shame. And S. Paul when Festus the Lieutenaūt scorned him as a mad man: I (saide he) moste deere Festus, am not madde as thou thinkest, but I speake the wordes of truth and sobrenes. And the auncient Christians when they wer slaundered to the people for mankillers, for adulterors, for committers of incest, for disturbers of common weales, and did perceaue that by suche slaunderous accusations ye Religion which they professed,

might be brought in question, namely if they should seeme to hold their peace, and in māner to confesse the fault: lest this might hinder the free course of the Gospell, they made Orations, they put vp supplications, and made meanes to Emperors and Princes, that they might defend them selues and theyr fellowes in open audience.
            But we trulye, seeing that so many thowsandes of our brethren in these last twenty yeares haue borne witnes vnto the truth, in the middest of most painfull tormēts that could be deuised: and when Princes desirous to restraine the Gospel sought many wayes but preuayled nothinge, and that now almost the whole worlde dothe begynne to open theyre eyes to behold the light: we take it that our cause hath already ben sufficiently declared and defended, and thinke it not needfull to make many wordes, since ye very matter saith inough for yt selfe. For yf the Popes woulde, or els if they could

weigh with their own selues the whole matter, and also the beginning and procedinges of our Religion, how in a mā
               ner al their trauail hath com to nought, no body driuing it forwarde, and without any wordely helpe: and howe on the other side, our cause, againste the will of Emperoures, from ye beginning against the willes of so many Kynges, in spite of the Popes, and almoste maugre the head of all men, hath taken encrease, and by little and little spredde ouer into all countries, and is com at length euen into Kings courtes and Palaices. These same thinges me thinketh might bee tokens greate ynough to them, that God him self doth strongly fight in our quarrel, and doth from heauen laugh at their enterprises: & that the force of the truth is suche, as neither mans power, nor yet hell gates are able to roote it oute. For they be not all mad at this day, so many free Cities, so manye Kynges, so manye Princes which haue fallen away from

the Seate of Roome, and haue rather ioyned themselues to the Gospell of Christe.
            And although the Popes had neuer hetherunto

               ter oughte to seeme ye worse. Or yf they perchaunce will not see that whiche they se in deede, but rather will withstande the knowen truth, ought wee therefore by and by to be coumpted heret
                  •
               kes, bycause we obay not their will and pleasure? Yf so be that Pope Pius were the man (we say not which he would so gladly be called) but i
                  •
                he were in deede a man that eyther woulde accoumpte vs for his brethrene, or at least woulde take vs to be men, he woulde firste diligently haue examined

our reasons, and woulde haue sene what might be saied with vs, what againste vs, and woulde not in his Bull whereby he lately pretended a Coūcel, so rashely haue condēned so great a part of the worlde, so many learned and godly men, so manye common wealthes, so many kyngs, and so many Prynces, only vppon his owne blynd preiudices and foredeterminations, and yt without hearing of them speak, or without shewing cause whye.
            But bycause he hath alredy so noted vs openlye, least by holdynge oure peace we should seme to graunt a fault, and specially bycause we can by no meane haue audience in ye publik assembly of the general Councel, wherein he would no creature should haue power to geue his voice or declare his opinion, excepte he were sworne and straightly bounde to maintaine his aucthoritie.
            For wee haue had good experience hereof in his last conference at the councel

at Trident, where the embassadours & diuines of the Princes of Germany and of the free Cities were quite shutte out from their company: nother can we yet forget, how Iulius the third, aboue ten yeares past, prouided warely by his writt, that none of our sorte shoulde bee suffered to speake in the Councell (except there were som paraduenture yt wolde recante and chaunge his opinion). For this cause chieflye we thoughte it good to yelde vp an accoumpte of oure faith in writing, & truely and openly to make aunswere to those things wherwith wee haue ben openly charged, to thende the worlde may see the partes and foundacions of that doctrine, in the behalfe whereof so many good men haue litle regarded their oune lyues. And yt al men may vnderstand what manner of people they be, and what opinion they haue of God and of Religion, whome the Bysshop of Rome before they were called to tell theire tale, hath condemned for heretikes,

without any good consideratiō, without any exaumple, & vtterly without lawe or righte, onelye bycause he hearde tell that they did dissente from hym and his in som pointe of Religion.
            And although S. Hierome would haue no bodie to be patient when he is suspected of heresy, yet we wil deal herein nether bitterly nor brablingly, nor yet be caried away wt angre & heate, though he ought to be reckned neither bitter nor brabler yt speaketh ye truth. We willingly leaue thys kynde of eloquence to oure aduersaries, who whatsoeuer they say against vs, be it neuer so shrewdly or dipitefully sayde, yet thinke it is sayd modestely and comely ynough, and care nothing whether it be trew or false. Wee neede none of these shyftes which do maintaine the truthe.
            Further, yf wee do shewe it plaine that Gods holie Gospell, the aunciente Byshops and the primatiue Churche do make on our syde, and that wee haue

not without iust cause left these men, and rather haue retourned to the Apostles and oulde catholique Fathers. And yf wee shall be founde to doe the same not coulorably or craftely, but in good faith, before God, truly, honestly, cleerely and plainly: and yf they thēselues which 
                  •
               ye our doctrine and woulde be called Catholiks, shall manifestly see how al those titles of antiquitie whereof they boste so much, ar quite shaken out of their hāds, and that there is more pith in this oure cause then they thoughte for, wee then hope and trust that none of them wil be so negligent and careles of his own saluation, but he will at length studye and bethinke him selfe, to whether parte hee were best to ioyne him. Vndoubtedlye, excepte one will altogether harden his hearte and refuse to heare, he shal not repent him to geue good heede to this out defence and to mark well what wee say, & how truly and iustly it agreeth with Christian Religion.
            For where they call vs Heretikes,

it is a crime so haynous, yt onles it may be seene, vnles it may be felt, & in māner may be holdē with hands and fingers, it ought not lightly to be iudged or beleued when it is 
                  •
               aide to the charge of any Christian man. For heresy is a 
                  •
               orsaking of saluatiō, a renouncing of Gods grace, a departing from the body and spirite of Christe. But this was euer an olde and solempne propretye with them and theire forefathers, yf any did complaine of their errours and faultes, and desired to haue true Religion restored, streighte waye to cōdemne such one for heretikes, as men new fangled & factious. Christe for no nother cause was called a Samaritan, but onely for yt he was thoughte to haue fallen to a certaine newe Religion, and to be the Aucthor of a newe sect. And Paul thapostle of CHRISTE was called before the Iudges to make aunswere to a matter of heresy, and therfore hee saied:
                  Act.

all thinges which be written in the law and in the Prophets.

                was called firste of the heathen people a Sect & Heresy. With these termes did they alwaies fil prīces eares, to thintent when they had once hated vs with a foredetermined opinion, and had coumpted all that wee sayed to bee faction and heresy, they might be so ledd away from ye truth & right vnderstāding of the cause. But the more sore and outragious a crime heresye is, the more it ought to be proued by plaine and strong argumentes, especially in this time, whē men begin to geue lesse credite to theyre words, & to make more diligent searche of theyr doctrine then they were wont to do. For ye people of God ar otherwyse instructed now then they were in times past, when all the Bysshopps of Romes sayenges were allowed for Gospell, & when all Religion did depende only vpon

their aucthoritie. Nowe a daies the holie scripture is abroad, the writinges of the Apostles & Prophets ar in printe, whereby all truth and Catholyke doctrine may be proued, and all heresie may be disproued and confuted.
            Sithens then they bring furth none of these for them selues, and call vs neuertheles Heretiques, which haue nether fallen from Christ nor from ye Apostles, nor yet from the Prophets, this ys an iniurious and a very spitefull dealinge. With this sword did Christe put of the Dyuel when he was tempted of him: wc these weapons oughte all presumption which doth auaūce it selfe against God, to be ouerthrowen and cōquered.

none other force then with ye holy scriptures.

                All those things (sayth he) which without the testimonie of the scriptures are holden as deliuered from ye Apostles, be throughly smitten down by the sword of Gods worde. S. Ambrose also to Gratianus ye Emperour: Let the scripture (sayeth he) bee asked the question, let the Apostles be asked, let ye Prophets be asked, & let Christ be asked. For at that time made the Catholik Fathers and Bysshops no doubt, but that our Religion mighte be proued out of ye holy scriptures.

               itike, whose errour they coulde not euidently & apparently reproue by the selfe

same scripturs. And we verely to make aunswere on this wise as S. Paul did: According to this way which they cal heresie, we do worship God and the father of our Lorde Iesus Christ, & do allowe all thinges which haue ben written either in ye Law or in the Prophet
                  •
               , or in ye Apostles workes.
            Wherefore yf we be heretikes, and they (as they woulde faine be called) bee Catholikes, why do they not, as they see the fathers which were Catholike men, haue alwaies don? why do they not conuince and maister vs by the diuine scriptures▪ why do they not call vs agayn to be tryed by them? why do they not lay before vs howe wee haue gon away frō Christ, from the Prophets, from the Apostels, and from the holy fathers? why stick they to do it? why are they afraide of it? It is Gods cause: whye are they doubtful to commit it to ye trial of gods worde? yf wee be heretkes which referre all our controuersies vnto the holy scriptures,

& report vs to ye selfe same words, which wee knowe were sealed by God him self, and in comparison of them set little by all other thinges whatsoeuer may be deuised by men, howe shall wee say to these folke I pray you, what mā
               ner of men be they, & howe is it meete to call them, which feare the iudgement of the holy scriptures, that is to say, ye iudgement of God hym self, and do preferre before them theyr owne Dreames, and full colde Inuentions: and to maintaine their owne traditions, haue defaced and corrupted now these many hundred yeares the ordinances of Christe and of the Apostles?
            Men say that Sophocles the tragicall Poet, when in his oulde dayes he was by his own sonnes accused before the Iudges for a dotinge and sottishe man, as one that fondelye wasted hys owne substaunce, and seemed to neede a Gouernour to see vnto him: to thintent he might cleere him selfe of the faulte, he

came into the place of Iudgemente, and when he had rehearsed before them his Tragedye called Oedipus Coloneus, which he had written at the verye tyme of his accusation, maruelous exactly and conningly, did of him selfe aske the Iudges, whether they thought any sottish or doting man could do the like peece of worke.
            In like manner, bycause these men take vs to be mad, and appeache vs for heretikes, as men which haue nothing to do neyther with CHRIST, nor with the Churche of GOD, wee haue iudged yt shoulde be to good purpose and not vnprofitable, yt wee doe openlye and frankely set furth our faith wherein we stande, and shew al that confidence which wee haue in CHRISTE IHESV, to the intent al men may se what is oure iudgement of euery pa

               From that place also wee beleeue that Christ shall com againe to execute that general iudgemēt, aswel of them whom he shall then synde aliue in the bodye, as of them that be already dead.
            Wee beleeue that the holy Ghoste, who is, the third person in the holie Trinitie; is very God: not made, not

               reat, not begotten, but proceding from both the Father and the Sonne, by a certain meane vnknowen vnto men & vnspeakable, and that it is his propretie to mollifie and soften ye hardnes of mans heart, when he is once receiued thereunto, eyther by ye holsom preaching of the Gospell, or by any other way: that he dothe geue men light, and guide them vnto the knowledge of God, to al waye of truth, to newnes of the whole liefe, and to euerlastinge hope of saluation.
            Wee beleeue that there is one Church of God, and that the same is not shutte vp (as in times past amonge the Iewes) into some one corner or kyngdome, but

that it is catholique and vniuersall, and dispersed throughout the whole worlde. So that there is now no nation which can truly complaine that they bee shutt furth. & maye not be one of ye Church & people of God: And that this Churche is the Kingedome, the bodye and the spouse of Christe: and that Christ alone is the Prince of thys Kyngedome, that Christ alone is the heade of this bodye, and that Christ alone is the brydgrome of this spouse.
            Furthermore that there be dyuerse degrees of ministers in the church, wher of some be deacons, some preestes, some Byshops, to whom is committed the office to instruct the people, and the whole charge and settinge furth of Religion: yet not withstanding we say that there neither is nor can be any one mā, which may haue the whole superioritie in this vniuersall state, for that Christe is euer present to assist his Church, and nedeth not any man to supply his roome, as his

onely heyre to all his substaunce: and y• there can bee noe one mortall creature, which is able to comprehēd or conceaue in his minde the vniuersall Churche, y• is to witte, all the partes of the worlde, muche les able to put them in ordre and to gouerne them rightly and duely.

And as for the Byshop of Rome, who nowe calleth all matters before him selfe alone, except he do his deuty as he ought to do, except he administer the sacraments, excepte he instructe the people, excepte he waxue them and teache them, wee say yt he ought not of right once to bee called a Bysshop, or so much as an elder. For a Byshop, as saith Augustine, is a name of labour and not of honour: bycause he would haue that mā to vnderstand him selfe to be no Byshop, which will seke to haue preeminence, and not to profyt others: And that neither the Pope nor any other worldly creature, can nomore be head of the whole Church or a Byshop ouer all, then he can be the brydegrome, the lighte, the saluation, and lyfe of the Church. For these priuileges and names belong onely to Christe, and be proprely & onely fyt for hym alone. And that no

               ciēt Coūcels & cōtrary to ye old Fathers. We beleue that he doth giue vnto himselfe▪ as it is written by his owne companyon Gregory,
                  Gregor. epistola. li, 4. epist. 76.78.80. Et lib. 7 epist. 6.6. a presūptuous, a prophane, a sacrilegious and Antichristian name: that he is also the kinge of pryde, that he is Lucifer, which preferreth himselfe before his bretherne: that he hathe

forsaken the faith, and is the foreronner of Antichriste.
            Further wee saye, that the Minister ought laufully, duely, and orderly to be preferred to that Office of the church of God, and yt no mā hath power to wrest himself into ye holy ministery at his own pleasure & list. Wherefore these persons do vs ye greater wrong, which haue nothing so common in their mouthe, as ye wee do nothing ordrely and comely, but al thinges troublesomly and without ordre: and that wee alow euery man to be a preest, to be a teacher, and to be an Interpretour of the Scriptures.
            Moreouer we say, yt Christ hath geuē to his ministers power to bind, to loose, to open, to shutt, and yt the office of loosing consisteth in this point, that ye Minister should either offer by ye preaching of the gospel the merits of Christe & full pardō, to suche as haue lowly & contrite hearts, and do vnfa
                  •
               nedly repent thē, pronoūcing vnto ye same a sure & vndoubted

forgeuenes of their sins, & hope of euerlasting saluation. Or els yt the minister, when any haue offended their brothers mindes with a greate offence, & with a notable & open tault, wherby they haue as it were bannyshed and made themselues straungers from the common fellowship, and from the bodye of Christe, then after perfitte amendement of suche persons, doth reconcile them, and bringe them home againe, and restore them to the company and vnitie of the faithfull. We say also that the minister dothe execute the aucthoritie of binding and shutting, as often as he shutteth vp the gate of the kingedome of heauen against the vnbeleeuing and stubborne persons, denouncing vnto them Gods vengaunce and euerlastinge punishmente. Or els when he doth quite shut them out from the bosome of the Churche by open ex-communicatiō. Out of doubt, what sentence so euer the Minister of God shall giue in this sorte, God him selfe doth so

well alowe of it, that what soeuer here in yearth by their meanes is loosed and bounde, God him selfe wil loose & binde, and confirme the same in heauen.
            And touchinge the kayes wherewith they maye either shut or open the kyngdome of heauen, wee with Chryso
                  ••
               om saye, they be the knowledge of the Scriptures: with Tertullian we say, they be the interpretation of the lawe: and with Eusebius we call thē the worde of God.
            Moreouer that Christes Disciples did receiue this aucthoritie, not that they shoulde heare priuate confessions of the people, and lysten to their whisperinges, as the cōmen Massing preestes do euery where nowe a dayes, and do it so, as though in that one poinct laye all the vertue and vse of the kayes: but to thend they should goo, they should teache, they should publishe abrode the Gospell, and be vnto the beleuing a swete sauour of lyfe vnto life, and vnto the vnbeleuing and vnfaithfull, a sauour of death vnto

death: and that the mindes of godly persons being brought low by the remorce of their former lyfe and errours, after they once begonne to looke vp vnto the light of the Gospel, and beleue in Christ, might be opened with ye worde of God, euē as a dore is opened with a keye. Cō

Paul sayeth,2. Tim. 1. waxe worse and worse. This take we to be the meaning of the keyes: and that after this fashion mens consciences eyther to be opened or shut. We saye that the preist in deede is Iudge in this case, but yet hath no maner of right to chalenge an auctoritie or power,

Seing then the keye whereby the waye and entery to yt kingdom of God is opened vnto vs, is the worde of the Gospell and thexpounding of the Lawe and Scriptures, we say plainely, where the same woorde is not, there is not the keye. And seyng one maner of worde is geuen to al, and one only keye belongeth to al, we say there is but one only power of all ministers, as concerning opening and shutting.

And although he tought and instructed the people (as woulde to

Also that these be the heauenly voices, wherby God hath opened vnto vs his will, and that onely in them mans hearte can haue setled reste: that in them be habundantly and fullye comprehended all thinges what soeuer be nedefull for our saluatiō, as Origene, Augustine, Chrysostom & Cyrillus haue taught: That they be ye very might and strength of God to attaine to saluation: That they be the foūdations of the Prophetes and Apostles, whereupon is buylte the Churche of God: That they be ye very sure and infallible rule, wherbe may be tryed whether ye Church doth stagger or erre, and wherunto all ecclesiasticall Doctrine ought to be called to accompte: and that against these scriptures neyther lawe nor ordinaunce, nor

any custom ought to be hard, no though Paule his owne selfe or an Aungell frō heauen shoulde come and teache the contrarie.
            Moreouer we alow the sacramētes of the Churche, that is to saye certaine holy signes & ceremonies whiche Christ woulde wee should vse, that by them he might set before our eyes the mysteries of our saluation, and might more strongely confirme our faith which we haue in his bloud, and might seale his grace in our heartes. And those sacramentes togither with Tertullian, Origene, Ambrose, Augustin, Hierome, Chrysostome, Basill, Dionysius, and other Catholique Fathers do we call figures, signes, markes or badges, printes, copies, formes, seales, signettes, similitudes, patterns, representations, remembraunces, and memories. And we make no doubt togither with the same Doctours to say, that those be certaine visible wordes, seales of righteousnes, tokens of grace:

and do expresly pronounce, that in the Lords supper, there is truelye geuē vnto the beleuing, the body and bloud of the Lord, the flesshe of the sonne of God, whiche quickeneth our soules, the meate that cometh from aboue, the foode of inmortalitie, grace, truth, and lyfe. And y• supper to be the cōmunion of ye body and bloud of Christ, by the partaking whereof wee be reuiued, wee be strengthened, and be fed vnto immortalitie, & wherby we are ioyned, vnited, & incorporate vnto Christ, that we may abide in him and he in vs.
            Besides wee acknowledge there be two sacramentes, which wee iudge proprely ought to be called by this name, that is to saye Baptisme, and the sacramētes of thankes giuing. For thus many we see were deliuered and sanctified by Christ, and well allowed of the oulde fathers Ambrose and Augustine. We say yt Babtisme is a sacrament of the remissiō of sinnes, and of that washing which we

haue in the blood of Christe, and that no persō which wil professe Christes name, oughte to bee restraigned or kepte backe therefrom: no not the very babes of Christiās, forsomuche as they be borne in sinne, and do pertaine vnto the people of God. We say that Eucharistia, the supper of the lorde, is a sacramente, that is to wytte, an euident token of the body and blood of Christe: wherein is set as it were before our eyes, the death of Christ and his resurrectiō, and what act so euer he did whilest he was in his mortall body, to thende we may giue hym thankes for his deathe, and for our deliueraunce. And yt by the often receauinge of this sacramente, wee may daily renewe the remembraunce of that matter, to thintent we being fedd with the body and blood of Christ, may be brought into the hope of the resurrectiō and of euerlasting life, and may moste assuredly beleue, that the bodye and blood of Christe dothe in like manner feede our soules, as breade and

wine doth feede our bodies. To this bā
               kett wee thinke the people of God ought to be earnestly bidden, that they may all communicate amonge them selues, and openly declare and testifie both the godly societie whiche is amonge them, and also the hope which they haue in Christ Ihesu. For this cause yf there had ben any which would be but a looker on, and abstaine from the holy Cōmunion, him did the old fathers & Byshops of Rome in the primatiue Church,

               Moreouer when the people commeth to the holy communion, the Sacrament ought to be giuen them in both kindes, for so both Christe hath commaunded, and the apostles in euery place haue ordayned, and all the auncient Fathers and Catholique Bysshops haue folowed the same.

            Besides, though wee saye we haue no meede at all by oure owne woorkes and deedes, but apoint all the meane of oure saluation to be in Christe alone, yet say we not that for this cause men ought to liue looslie and dissolutely: nor that it is ynough for a Christian to be Baptized onely and to belieue, as though there were nothing els required at his hande, for true faith is liuely, and can in no wise be idell.

            To conclude, we beleue that this our selfe same flesh wherin we liue, although it dye and come to dust, yet at the last day it shall retourne againe to lyfe by the meanes of Christes spirite which dweleth in vs, and that then verely whatsoeuer we suffer heere in the meane whyle for his sake, Christ wil wipe from of our eies all teares & lamentation, & that we through him shall enioy euerlasting life, and shall for euer be with him in glory.

He should haue commenced his sute rather against Christe, against the Apostles, and against the holy fathers. For these thinges did not only procede from them, but were also apointed by them: except perhaps these menne will say (as I thinke they will in deede) that Christe hath not instituted the holy Communion to be diuided amongest the faithfull: Or that Christes apostles and the auncient fathers haue saide Priuate masses in euery corner of the Temples, nowe tenne, now twenty togithers in one day: Or that Christ and hys Apostls bannished all the common people from the Sacrament of his bloud: or that the thing whiche them selues do at this day euery wheare, and do it so as they condemne him for an heritike whiche dothe otherwise, ys not called of Gelasius their owne doctour plaine sacriledge: or

Of a truthe, vnitie and concorde dothe best become Religion, yet is not vnitie the sure and certaine marke whereby to knowe the Church of God. For there was the greatest consente that might bee amongest them that worshipped the Golden calfe, and among them whiche with one voice ioyntly cryed against our Sauiour Iesu Christe, Crucifie him. Nother bicause the Corinthians were vnquieted with priuate dissensions, or bicause Paule did square with Peter, or Barnabas with Paule: or bicause the Christians vpon the very beginning of the Gospell were at mutuall discorde, touchinge some one matter, may we therefore thinke there was no church of God amongest them▪ And as for those personnes whom they vpon spite cal Zwinglians and Lutherians, in very deede they of bothe sydes

be Christians, good friendes & brethern. They vary not betwixt thēselues vpon the principles and foundacions of oure religiō, nor as touching God nor Christ nor the holy Ghoste, nor of the meanes to iustification; nor yet euerlasting life, but vpon one onely question, whiche is neither weightie nor great: neither mistrust we or make doubte at all, but they will shortely be agreed. And if there bee any of them whiche haue other opinion than is meete, we doubt not but or it bee longe, they will put apart all affections and names of parties, and that God wil reueale it vnto them: so that by better considering & searching out of the matter, as once it cam to passe in the Councel of Calcedone, al causes & seedes of dissension shall bee throughly pluct vp by the roote, and be buried and quite forgotten for euer. whiche God graunt.

It is doubtles an odiouse mater for one to leaue the fellowshipp whereunto he hath ben accustomed, and specially of those men, who though they be not, yet at leaste seme and be called Christians.

Thus with a gay and iolie shewe deceiue they the simple, and seke to choke vs with the very name of the church.

But as I said, leaste men should thus speake still, Paul the apostle found the like faultes and falles euen then in the prime and chiefe of the Gospel, in chiefe perfection, and in lighte, so that he was compelled to write in this sorte to the Galatians, whom he had wel before that instructed: I feare me (quod he) leaste I haue laboured emongest you in vayne, and leaste ye haue heard ye Gospel in vaine, O my litle Children, of whom I trauaile a new, til Christ be fashioned againe in you: And as for the Churche of the Corinthians, how fouly it was defiled, is nothing needeful to rehearce. Now tel me, might the Churches of the Galathians and Corinthians goe amisse, and the churche of Rome alone may it not fayle ner goe amysse?

For wel nere in all controuersies, and namely touching the vse of the holy communion vnder both kindes, although the wordes of Christ be plaine and euident, yet doth Hosius disdainefully reiect them, as no better then colde and dead elementes: and commaundeth to giue faith to certaine new lessons apointed by the Church, & to I wot not what reuelations of the holye Ghoste. And Pighius saieth, men ought not to beleue, no not ye most cleare and manifest wordes of the scriptures, onles the same be allowed for good by the interpretatiō and auctoritie of the churche.

So (in good faith) doe these menne when they woulde haue all their owne doinges in estimation, as though they had ben deliuered to vs euē from the Apostles or from Christe hymselfe, to thende there might be founde no where any thinge able to conuince such

                Heretiques, saith he, shutt vp the doores against the trueth: for they know ful wel, yf the doore were open, the Churche shuld be none of theirs. Theophylact also: Gods worde saith he, is the Candle whereby the theefe is espyed: and Tertullian saith, the holy Scripture manifestlye findeth out the fraude and theafte of Heretiques. For why do they hyde, why do they kepe vnder the Gospell, whiche Christ would haue preched alowde from the house top? Why whealine they that light vnder a Bushell, whiche ought to stande on a Candlestick? why trust they more to the blyndenes of the vnskilfull multitude and to ignoraunce, then to the goodnes of their cause? thinke they their slightes are not alredy perceiued, and yt they cā walke now vnespied, as though

they had Giges tyng to go inuisible by, vpon theyre finger? No no: all men see nowe well and well agayne, what good stuffe is in that Chest of the Bysshop of Romes bosome. This thinge alone of it selfe maye be an argumente sufficiente, that they worke not vprightly and truely. Worthely ought that mater seme suspicious which fleeth trial, and is afrayde of the light: for he that doth euill, as Christ saith, seekith darkenesse, & hateth light. A conscience yt knowith it selfe cleere, cōmeth willingly into open shew, that the workes whiche procede of God may be seen. Neither be they so very blind, but they se this wel ynogh howe their owne kyngedome strayght way is at a pointe, yf the scripture once haue the vpper hande: and that lyke as men say, the Idolles of diuells in times past, of whom menne in doubtfull matters were then wont to receiue aūswers, were sod

into the world: euen so they see that now al their suttle practises wil sone fal down hedlong vpon the sight of the Gospell. For Antichrist is not ouerthrowen but with the brightnes of Christes cōming.
            As for vs, we runne not for succour to the fyer as these mennes guyse is, but we runne to the scriptures: neyther doe we reason with the sworde, but with ye worde of God: and therewith as saythe Tertullian, do we feed our fayth: by it do we styr vp our hope, and strengthen our confidence. For wee knowe that the Gospell of IESV CHRIST is the power of God vnto saluation, and that therein consisteth eternall lyfe. And as Paule warneth vs, wee do not heare, no not an Aungel of God coming from heauen, yf he go about to pull vs from any parte of this doctrine. Yea more then this, as the holy martyr Iustine spekith of hym selfe, we would giue no credence to God him selfe, yf he should teache vs any other Gospell.
            
               For where these menne byd the holie Scriptures away, as domme and frutles, and procure vs to come to God him selfe rather, who speaketh in the Church and in Councelles: whiche is to saye, to beleue their fansies and opinions. This waye of fynding out the truth is verye vncertaine and exceding daungerous, & in māner a Fantastical & a mad way, and by no meanes allowed of the holye Fathers. Chrysostom saith, there be many oftentymes whiche boast themselues of the holye Ghoste: but truelye who so speake of their owne head, doe falselye boast they haue the spirite of God. For like as, saith he, Christ denied he spake of him selfe when he spake out of the lawe and Prophets, euen so now, yf any thing be preassed vpon vs in the name of the holy Ghoste saue the Gospell, we ought not to beleue it. For as Christ is the fulfilling of the lawe and the Prophetes, so is the holye Ghoste the fulfyllinge of the Gospell. Thus farre goeth Chrysostom.
            
               But here I looke thei wil say, though they haue not the Scriptures, yet maye chaunce they haue the Auncient Doctours, and the holy Fathers with them. For this is a high bragge they haue euer made, how that al antiquity and a continuall consent of all ages dothe make on their side: and that all our cases be but new & yester dayes worke, & vntill these fewe laste yeares neuer heard of. Questionlesse there can nothing be more spitfully spoken against the religion of God thē to acuse it of noueltie, as a new comē vp matter. For as ther can be no chaūge in God him selfe, no more ought there to be in his religion.
            Yet neuertheles we wote not by what meanes, but we haue euer seene it come so to passe from the first beginning of al, that as often as God did giue but some light, and did open his truth vnto men, though ye truth wer not only of greatest antiquitie, but also from euerlasting, yet

of wicked men & of the aduersaries was it called Newfāgled and of late deuised. That vngracious and bloud thrist

            But how if the thinges whiche these men are so desirous to haue seeme newe, be found of greatest antiquitie? Contrariwise, howe if all the thinges well nye, whiche they so greatly set out with the name of antiquitie, hauing been wel and throughly examined, be at length founde to be but new, and deuised of verye late? Southly to say, no man that had a true and right cōsideracion, would think the Iewes lawes and cerimonies to be new for all Hammans accusation: for they were grauen in very auncient Tables of most antiquitie. And although many did take Christ to haue swarued from Abraham & the old fathers, & to haue brought in a certaine newe religion in his owne name, yet aunswered hee them directly: Yf ye beleeued Moyses, ye woulde beleeue mee also, for my doctrine is not so new as you make yt. For Moses an author of greatest antiquitie, and one to

whome ye geue al honor, hath spoken of me. Paule likewise, though the Gospell of Iesus Christe be of many counted to be but new, yet hath it (saith he) the testimonie most old, both of the law and prophetes. As for our doctrine whiche wee may rightlier cal Christes catholik doctrine, it is so farre of from newe, that God who is aboue all most auncient, & the father of our Lorde Iesus Christe, hath left the same vnto vs in ye Gospel, in ye prophets & Apostles woorkes, beinge monuments of greatest age. So that no man can nowe thinke oure doctrine to be newe, onlesse the same thinke either the prophetes faithe, or the Gospell, or els Christe himselfe to be newe.
            And as for their religion, if it be of so longe continuance as thei woulde haue men weene it is, why doe they not proue it so by the exaumples of the Primatiue Churche, and by the Fathers and Councells of olde tymes? Whye lyeth so auncient a cause thus longe in the duste,

destitute of an Aduocate? Fyer and sworde they haue had alwayes ready at hande, but as for the olde Councels & the fathers, al Mum, not a word. They did surely against all reason to beginne first with these so bloudy and extreme means if thei could haue found other more easy and gentle wayes. And yf they truste so fully to antiquitie, and vse no dissimulation, why didde Iohn Clement a countrye manne of owres, but fewe yeares past, in the presence of certaine honest menne and of good credite, teare and cast into the fyer certaine leaues of Theodorete the moste aunciente Father and a greeke Bysshoppe, wherein he plainelye and euidentlye taughte, that the nature of breade in the Communion was not chāged, abolished or brought to nothing And this didde he of purpose, bicause he thought ther was no other copy thereof to be foūd.

            But yf they will saye that all these thinges are worne now out of vre, and nye dead, and pertaine nothing to these present tymes, yet to thend all folke may vnderstande what faith is to be geuen to these men, and vpon what hope they call togithers their generall Councelles, let vs see in few wordes what good heed they take to the selfe same things, which they them selues these very last yeres (& the remembraunce thereof ys yet new & freshe) in their owne generall Councell that they had by order called, decreed and commaunded to be deuoutely kepte. In the last Councell at Trident, scant fourtene yeares paste, it was ordeined by the common consent of all degrees, that one man shoulde not haue two benefices at one time. What is become now of that

ordinaūce? is ye same to so sone worne but of mynde and cleane consumed? For these men ye se giue to one man not two benefices onely, but sundry Abbaies many times, sometime also two Bishoprykes, sometime three, sometime foure, and that not onely to an vnlearned man, but often times euē to a man of warre.
            In the sayde Councell a decree was made, that all Byshops should preach ye Gospell. These menne neyther preache nor once go vp into the Pulpet, neyther thinke they it any parte of their Office. What great pompe & crake then ys this they make of antiquitie? Why bragge they so of the names of the auncient Fathers, and of the new and olde Councelles? Whye will they seme to trust to their auctoritie, whome when they lyft, they despise at their owne pleasure?
            But I haue a special fansy to cōmon a worde or two rather with the Popes good holinesse, and to saye these thinges to his owne face. Tell vs I praye you,

               o, be the orient colours and precious sauours of Christian religion: these thinges doth God looke vpon, & accepteth them thankfully: these must come in place to be honored and put quite away, the institutiōs of Christ and of his Apostls. And like as in times past when wicked kinge Ieroboam had takē from the people ye right seruing of God, & brought them to worship golden calues, least perchaūce they might afterwards chaunge their minde and slippe awaye, gettinge them again to Ierusalem to the Temple of God there, hee exhorted them with a long tale to be stedfast, saying thus vnto them: O Israell, these Calues be thy Gods. In this sorte commaunded your God you should worshippe him. For it shoulde be wearisome and troublous for you to take vpō you a iorney so farre of, and yearly to go vp to Ierusalem, there to serue and honour your God. Euen after the same sorte euery whit, when these men had once made the lawe of God of

none effect through their owne traditions, fearing that the people should afterwards open their eyes and fall an other way, and shoulde somwhence els seeke a suret meane of their saluation, Iesu, how oftē haue thei cried out: This is the same worshippinge that pleaseth God, and whiche hee straitly requireth of vs, and wherwith he wil be tourned from his wrath, that by these thinges is conserued the vnitie of the Church, by these al sinnes clensed and consciences quieted: and who so departeth from these, hath left vnto himselfe no hope of euerlasting saluation. For it were wearisome and troublous (saye they) for the people to resorte to Christ, to the Apostles, and to ye auncient fathers, and to obserue continually what their wil and commaundement should be. This ye may se▪ is to wt
               draw the people of God frō ye weake elements of the worlde, frō ye leauen of the Scribes & Pharisies, and from the traditions of mē. It were reasō no doubt yt
               
Christes commaundementes and the Apostls were remoued, that these their deuises might come in place. O iuste cause I promise you, why that auncient and so longe alowed doctrine should be now abolished, and a newe forme of religion be brought into the Churche of God.
            And yet whatsoeuer it be, these menne crye stil that nothing ought to be changed, that mens mindes are well satisfied here withal, that the Churche of Rome ye church which cannot erre, hath decreed these thinges. For Siluester Prierias saith yt the Romish churche is the squyer & rule of truth, and that ye holy scripture hath receiued from thence bothe authoritie and credite. The doctrine saith he, of the Romish church, is the rule of moste infallible faith, from the whiche the holy scripture taketh his force. And Indulgences and pardons (saith he) are not made knowē to vs by ye authoritie of the scriptures, but they are knowē to vs by the authoritie of the Romyshe Church,

and of the Byshops of Rome, whiche is greater. Pighius also letteth not to say, that without the licence or the Romyshe Church, we ought not to beleue the very plaine scriptures: much like as yf any of those that cānot speake pure & cleane Latin, and yet can bable out quickely & redily a litle some such law Latin as seruith the Courte, would needes hold that all others ought also to speake after the same way which Mametrectus & Catholicō spake many yeare ago, & which them selues doe yet vse in pleadyng in Courte, for so may it be vnderstand sufficiently what is said, and mennes desires be sati

But what yf Ieremye tell them, as is afore rehersed, that these be lyes? what yf ye same Prophete saye in an other place, that the selfe same menne who ought to be kepers of the vineyarde, haue brought to naught and destroyed the Lordes vynearde? How yf Christ saye, that the same persones who chiefely ought to haue a care ouer the Temple, haue made of ye Lords Temple a denne of Theues? Yf it be so that the Churche of Rome cannot erre, it must nedes folowe, that the good lucke therof is farre greater then al these mennes policie. For suche is their lyfe,

their doctrine and their diligence, that for all them the Churche may not onely erre, but also vtterly be spoyled and peryshe. No doubt, yf that Churche maye erre whiche hath departed from Godds worde, from Christes commaundementes, from the Apostls ordinaunces, from the primatiue Churches examples, from the old Fathers and Councelles orders, and from their own Decrees, and which wil be bound wt in the compasse of none neither oulde nor new, nor their owne, nor other folkes, nor mannes lawe, nor Goddes law, then yt is out of all question, that the Ro
                  •
               yshe Churche hath not onely had power to erre, but that it hath shamefully and most wickedly erred in very deed.
            But say they, ye haue ben once of our felowship, but now ye are become forsakers of your profession, and haue departed from vs. It is trew we haue departed from them, and for so doing we both giue thankes to almightie God, & great

lye reioyce on our owne behalfe. But yet for all this, from the primatiue Church, from the Apostles, and from Christ wee haue not departed, true it is. We were brought vp with these menne in darkenes, and in ye lack of knowledge of God, as Moses was taught vp in the learning and the bosome of the Egyptians. We haue ben of youre company saith Tertullian, I confesse it, and no maruaile at all, for saith he, menne be made and not borne Christians. But wherefore I pray you haue they them selfe, the citizens and dweliers of Rome remoued, and come downe from those seauen hilles, whervpon Rome sometime stood, to dwel rather in the plaine called Mars his field? They wil say peraduenture, by cause the conductes of water, wher with out menne cannot commodiouslye liue, haue now failed and ar dried vp in those hilles. Well then, lett them giue vs lyke leaue inseeking the water of eternal lyfe, that they giue them selfes in seekyng the

water of the well, for the water verely fayled amongest them. Thelders of the Iewes sayth Ieremye, sent their litle ones to the waterings, and they finding no water, beyng in a miserable case and vtterly marred for thurst, brought home againe their vessells emptie. The nedye & poore folke saith Esaye, sought about for water, but no wheare founde they any, their tonge was euē withered with thirst. Euen so these menne haue broken in peeces al the pypes and cōduites, they haue stopped vp al the springs, & choked vp the fountaine of liuyng water with durte and myre. And as Caligula many yeres past locked fast vp al the storehouses of corne in Rome, & thereby brought a generall derth and famyne amongest the people, euē so these men by damming vp all the fountaines of Goddes word, haue brought the people into a peetiful thirst. They haue brought into ye world as saith the Prophete Amos, a hungre and a thurst, not the hunger of breade,

nor the thurst of water, but of hearing the worde of God. With greate distresse went they scattering about, seeking some sparke of heauenly light to refresh their consciences withall, but that light was alredy thoroughly quenched out, so that they could finde none. This was a rueful state. This was a lamentable forme of Goddes Churche. It was a miserie to liue therin without the Gospel, without light, and without all comfort.
            Wherfore though our departing wer a trouble to them, yet ought they to consider withall, how iust cause wee had of our departure. For yf they wil saye, it is in no wise lawfull for one to leaue the felowship wherein he hath bē brought vp, they maye aswell in our names or vpon our heades condemne both the Prophetes, the Apostles, and Christ him selfe. For whye complayne they not also of this, that Lot went quitte his way out of Sodome, Abraham out of Calde, the Israelites out of Egypte, Christ frō the

Iewes, and Paule from the Pharisees? For except it be possible there maye be a lawful cause of departing, we see no reasone whye Lot, Abraham, the Israelites, Christ and Paule may not be accused of sectes and seditiō, aswel as others. And yf

                these men will needes condemne vs for Heretiques, bycause we do not all thinges at their commaūdement, whom (in gods name) or what kynde of menne ought they them selues to be taken for, whiche despise the commaundement of Christ, & of the Apostles? If we be scismatiques bycause we haue lefte them, by what name shall they be called themselues which haue forsaken the Grekes, frō whom they first receiued their faith, forsaken the primatiue Church, forsaken Christ hymselfe and the Apostls, euen as Children should forsake their parentes? For though those Grekes, who at this daye professe religion and Christes name, haue many thinges corrupted amō
               gest them, yet houlde they still a greate

numbre of those thinges whiche they receiued from the Apostles. They haue neyther priuate Masses, nor mangled Sacramentes, nor Purgatories, nor Pardons. And as for the titles of hygh Byshops, & those glorious names, they estime them so, as whosoeuer he were that woulde take vpon hym the same, & woulde be called eyther Vniuersall bysshop, or the Hed of the vniuersal church, they make no doubt to call suche a one, both a passing proude man, a man that worketh despite against all y• other Bysshoppes his bretherne, and a plaine Heretique.
            Now then synce it is manifest and out of all peraduenture, that these men are fallen from y• Grekes, of whom they receiued the Gospell, of whome they receiued the faith, the true Religion and ye Church, what is ye mater why they will not now be called home again to ye same men, as it were to their originals & first founders? And whye be they afraide to

take a paterne of the Apostles and olde Fathers tymes, as though they all had ben voyde of vnderstanding? Do these menne, wene ye, see more or set more by the Church of God, then they dede who firste deliuered vs these thinges?
            We truely haue renounced that church wherin we could neyther haue ye worde of God sincerely taught, nor the Sacraments rightlye administred, nor the name of God dewly called vppon, whyche Churche also themselues confesse to be faulty in many poin

            Wee haue broughte againe the Lords supper vnto Christes institution,

and will haue it to be a Communion in very deede, common and indifferent to a great number, accordinge to the name. But these men haue chaunged al things contrarie to Christes institution, & haue made a priuate Masse of the holy Communion: and so it commeth to passe, that we giue the Lordes supper vnto the people, and they giue them a vaine pagent to gase on.
            We affirme togither with the auncient fathers, that the body of Christe is not eaten but of the good and faithfull, and of those that are endued with the spirit of Christe. Their doctrine is, that Christes very bodie effectually, & as they speake, really and substantially, may not only be eaten of the wicked and vnfaithful men, but also (which is monstrous to be spoken) of myse and dogges.
            Wee vse to praye in Churches after that fashion, as accordinge to Paules lesson,

            But not to tarry about rehearsing all poyntes wherein we and thei differ, for they haue wel nye no end, we tourne the scriptures into al tongues, they scant suffer them to be had abroad in any tongue: we allure ye people to reade and to heare Gods word, thei driue the people frō it. We desire to haue our cause knowen to al ye world, they flee to come to any trial. We leane vnto knowlege, they vnto ignoraunce: We trust vnto light, thei vnto darkenes: We reuerence as it becōmeth vs, the writings of ye Apostles and Prophetes, & they burne them.

            But peraduenture they will saye, it was treason to attempt these matters without a sacred generall Councell: for in that consisteth the whole force of the Churche: there CHRIST hath promised he will euer bee a present assistant. Yet they themselues without tarrienge for anye generall Councell, haue broken the commaundementes of Godde, and the decrees of the Apostles: and as wee sayde a little aboue, they haue spoyled and disanulled almoste all, not onelye ordinaunces, but euen the doctrine of the primatiue Churche.

Peter verily, whome the Pope hath oftener in his mouth and more reuerently vseth to speake of, then he dothe of Iesu Christ, did boldly stand against the holy Councel, saieng, It is better to obey God, then men. And after Paule had once intirely embraced the Gospel, and had receiued it not frō men, nor by man, but by the only will of God, he did not take aduise therin of fleshe and bloud, nor brought ye case before his kinsemen & brethren, but went furth with into Arabia to preache Gods diuine mysteries, by Goddes onelye authoritie

In times paste when Nazianzene sawe in his daies how men in suche assemblies were so blynde and wilfull, that they were caried with affections, and laboured more to get the victory then ye trueth, he pronounced openly, that he neuer had sene a good ende of any Councell: what woulde he say now yf he were

wil neyther haue the case to be freely disputed, nor yet how many errours soeuer there be, suffer they any to be chaunged. For it is a cōmon custome of theirs, often and shameleslye to boast that their Churche cannot erre, that in it there is no faulte, and that they muste giue place to vs in nothynge.

and Deacons as saith Cyprian, and certeine also of the cōmen people were called ther vnto, and made acquainted with ecclesiasticall matters.

Or as Esaias saith, what yf al ye watchemē of ye city are become blind? what yf ye salt haue lost his propre strength and sauerines, and as Christe saith, be good for no vse, scant woorthe the castyng on the doungehyl?
            Wel yet then, they wil bring al matters before the Pope, who cannot erre. To this I say, firste it is a madnes to thynke that the holy Ghoste taketh his

flight from a generall Councell to run to Rome, to thende yf he doubt or sticke in any matter, and cannot expound it of him selfe, he maye take counsell of some other spirite, I wote not what, that is better learned then him selfe. For yf this be true, what neded so many Byshopps, with so great charges and so farre iorneyes, haue assembled their Conuocatiō at this present at Trident? Yt hadde ben more wisedom and better, at least it had ben a moche nearer way and handsommer to haue brought all thinges rather before ye Pope, and to haue come streght furth, and haue asked counsell at his diuine breast. Secōdly, it is also an vnlaufull dealing to tosse our matter from so many Byshoppes and Abbottes, and to bryng it at laste to the trial of one onely man, specially of hym who him selfe ys appeached by vs of hainous and foule enormities, and hath not yet put in hys aunswere: who hath also afore hand cō

Is not this the course of the Councelles in these dayes? are not all thynges remoued from the whole holy Councell and brought before the Pope alone? that as though nothing had ben don to purpose by the iudgementes and consentes of suche a numbre, he alone maye adde, alter, diminishe, disanull, alow, remytt and qualifie what soeuer he lyst? whose wordes be these then? and whye haue the Byshoppes and Abbottes in the last Councell at Trident but of late concluded with sayng thus in thende, Sauing alwyes the auctoritie of the sea Apostolique in all thynges?

How yf he haue renounced the faith in Christ, and become an Apostata, as Liranus sayth many Popes haue bene? And yet for all this, shall the holye Ghoste with turning of a hand, knock at his breast, & euē wheter he will or no, yea & wholy against hys will, kindle hym a lyght so as he maye not erre? shall he streght waye be the head spring of al right, and shal al treasure of wisdome and vnderstanding be founde in him, as it were laide vp in store?

In dede Peter Asotus and his companion Hosius sticke not to affirme,
                  Hosius cō Brentium. Lib. 2.
                that the same Councell wherein our sauiour Iesu Christe was condemned to dye, had both the spirit of prophesieng, and the holy Ghost, and the spirite of truth in it: and that it was neither a false nor a trifflinge saieng, when those Byshoppes sayde, We haue a lawe, and by our law he ought to dye, and ye thei so sayenge did light vpon the very trouthe of iudgement: for so be Hosius wordes,

and that the same plainelye was a iuste decree, whereby they pronounced that Christ was worthy to die. This me thinketh is straunge, that these men are not able to speake for themselues and defend their owne cause, but thei must also take parte with Annas and Caiphas. For yf they will call that a laufull and a good Councell, wherein the Sonne of God was moste shamfully condemned to dye, what Councell will they then alowe for false and naught? And (yet as all their Councels, to say truth, commōly be) necessitie compelled them to pronoūce these thinges of the Councell holden by Annas and Caiphas.
            But wil these men (I say) refourme vs the churche, beinge themselues both the persons guilty and the Iudges to? Will they abate their own ambitiō and pride? Wil they ouerthrow their owne matter, and giue sentence against them selues, that they must leaue of to be vnlearned Byshoppes, slowbellies, heapers together

of benefices, takers vpon them as princes and men of warre? Will the Abbottes the Popes deere darlinges iudge that monke for a theefe, which laboureth not for his liuing? and that it is against all lawe, to suffer suche a one to liue and to be found either in citie or in countrie, or yet of other mennes charges? Or els that a monke ought to lye on the groūd, to liue hardly with hearbes and peason, to study earnestly, to argue, to praye, to worke with hande, and fully to bend him selfe to come to ye ministery of ye church? In faith, assone will the Pharisies and Scribes repaire agame the Temple of God, and restore it vnto vs a house of prayer, in steede of a theeuish denne. Ther haue ben, I know, certain of their own selues which haue foūd fault, we many errours in ye church, as Pope Adrian, Eneas siluius, Cardinal Poole, Pighius & others, as is afore saide, thei held afterwards their Councel at Trident in ye self same place where it is now appointed.

There assembled many Byshoppes and Abbottes and others whom it behoued. For that matter they were alone by themselues, whatsoeuer they did no body gainesaid it: for they had quite shut out and barred oure syde from all manner of assemblies, and there they sat sixe yeares feedinge folkes with a meruelous expectation of their doings. The first sixe moneths, as though it were greatly nedeful, they made many determinations of the holy Trinitie, of the Father, of ye Son, and of the holy Ghost, which were godly thinges in deede, but not so necessarye for that time. Let vs see in all that while of so many, so manifest, so often confessed by them & so euident errours, what one errour haue they amended? from what kinde of idolatrie haue they reclaimed the people? What superstition haue they taken away? What peece of their tyranny and pompe haue they diminished? as though all the worlde may not nowe see, that this is a Conspiracie and

not a Councell, and that these Byshopes whom the Pope hath now called to gether, be wholy sworne & become bounde to beare him their faithfull allegiaunce, and wil do no manner of thing, but that they perceiue pleaseth him, and helpeth to aduaunce his power, and as hee will haue it: Or that they reckon not of the number of mennes voyces, rather then haue weight and consideracion of the same: Or that myght doth not often times ouercome the right.
            And therefore we knowe that diuers times many good men and Catholique Bysshops did tarry at home, and would not come when such Councels were called, wherein men so apparauntly laboured to serue factions and to take partes, bicause they knewe they should but lose their trauaile and dooe no good, seeinge where vnto their enemies mindes were so wholye bent. Athanasius denyed to come when hee was called by the Emperour to his Councell at Cesarea, perceiuinge

plaine he shoulde butte come amonge his ennemies whiche deadly hated hym. The same Athanasius when he came afterwarde to the Councell at Sirmium, and foresaw what would be the ende by reasone of the outrage and malyce of his ennimies, hee packed vp his carriage, and went away immediately.

were named Patropassians. Paulinus Bysshoppe of Tryer, and manye others moe, refused to comme to the Councell at Millaine, whenne they vnderstoode what a styrre and rule Auxentius kepte there: for they sawe yt was in vaine to go thither, where not reasone but faction shoulde prevayle, and where folke cōtended not for ye truth and right iudgement of the matter, butte for partialitie and fauour.

Or yf the sayd kynges & Princes happen to entermedly in suche matters, and take vpon them to do that they may do, that they be commaunded to doe, and ought of duty to do, & the same thinges that we know both Dauid and Salomon and other good Princes haue don, that is, yf they whiles the Pope and his

Prelates slugge and sleepe, or els mischevouslye withstande them, doe bridle the Preistes sensualitie, and driue them to do their dewty, and kepe them still to yt: yf they do ouerthrow Idols, yf they take away superstition, and set vp again the true worshiping of God, whye do they by and by make an out crye vpon them, that suche Princes trouble all, and presse by violence into an other bodyes office, and do therby wickedly and malepartly. What scripture hath at any time forbidden a Christiā Prince to be made priuey to such causes? Who but themselues alone made euer any suche lawe?

Setting these thinges aside, what teache they? what say they? what doe they? how lyue they? I saye not, as maye become a Byshopp, but as may become euen a Christian man, Is it so great a mater to haue a vaine title, and by chaunging a garment onely to haue the name of a Byshop?
            Surely to haue the principall staye & effecte of all maters commited wholy to these mennes hands, who neyther know

nor will know these thinges, nor yet set a iote by any poinct of Religion, saue yt which concernes their belly and Ryot, & to haue them alone sit as Iudges, and to be set vp as ouerseers in ye watch tower being no better then blynd spyes: of the other side, to haue a Christian Prince of good vnderstanding and of a right iudgement, to stande still like a blocke or a stake, not to be suffred: nother to giue his voice, nor to shewe his iudgement, but onely to wayt what these men shall well and commaund, as one whiche had neyther eares nor eyes nor wytt, nor hearte, and whatsoeuer they giue in charge, to alowe it without exception, blindly fulfilling their commaundementes, be they neuer so blasphemous and wicked, yea although they commaunde him quite to destroye all Religion, & to crucifie again Christ him selfe. This surely besides that it is proud and spitefull, ys also beyond all right and reason and not to be endured of Christiā and wyse Princes. Why

I praye you, may Cayphas and Annas vnderstand these matters, and may not Dauid and Ezechias do the same? Is it laufull for a Cardinall being a man of warre and delightius in bloud, to haue place in a Councell, & is it not lauful for a Christian Emperour or a kynge? wee truely graunt no further libertie to our Magistrates, then that we know hath both ben giuen thē by the word of God, and also confirmed by the exāples of the very best gouerned cōmon welthes. For besids that a Christian Prince hath the charge of both Tables cōmited to him by God, to thende he maye vnderstande that not temporall matters only, but also Religious & ecclesiasticall causes pertaine to his Office. Besides also that God by his Prophettes often and earnestly cōmaundeth the king to cut down the groues, to breake downe the Images and aultres of Idoles, and to write out the boke of ye law for him selfe: and besides that the prophet Esaias saith, a

kyng ought to be a patrone and nurse of the Churche: I saye besides all these thinges, we se by histories and by examples of the best tunes, that good Princes euer tooke thadministration of ecclesiastical matters to partain to their duety. Moses a Ciuile Magistrat & chief guide of the people,

            And to rehearse no more exampls out of the old law, let vs rather cōsider since the birthe of Christ, howe the Churche hath ben gouerned in the Gospels time. The Christian Emperours in old time, appoincted the Councelles of the Bysshops. Constantine called the Councell at Nice, Theodotius the first, called the Councell at Constātinople. Theodotius the second, the councel at Ephesus, Martian

the Councell at Chalcedone: and when Rufine the heretike had alleadged for authoritie, a Councell whiche as hee thought, shoulde make for him: Hieroin his aduerrsarie to confute him, Tell vs (quod hee) what Emperour commaunded that Councell to be called? The same Hierome againe in his Epitaphe vpon Paula, maketh mention of the Emperours letters, whiche gaue commaundement to call the Bysshoppes of Italie and Grecia to Rome to a Councel. Continuallye for the space of fiue hundreth yeares, Themperoure alone appointed thecclesiasticall assemblies, and called the Councelles of the Bysshops togither.
            We nowe therefore maruail the more at the vnreasonable dealinge of the Bysshoppe of Rome, who knowinge what was the Emperoures right when the Churche was well ordered, knowinge also that it is nowe a common right to all princes, for so muche as Kinges are now fully possessed in the seuerall partes

of the whole Empire, dothe so without consideration assigne that office alone to himselfe, and taketh it sufficient in summoning a general Councel,

In the second Councell called Arausicanum, the Princes Embassadours being noble menne borne, not only spake their minde touching Religion, but set to their handes also, aswel as the Byshops. For thus is it writen in the later end of that Coū
               cel, Petrus, Marcellinus, Felix and Liberius, being most noble menne, and the famous Lieutenauntes and Capitaines of Fraunce, & also Peeres of the Realm, haue giuen their consent, and set to their handes. Further, Syagrius. Opilio, Pantagattus, Deodatus, Cariattho and Marcellus, menne of very great honour haue subscribed. Yf it be so then, that Lieutenauntes, chyefe Capitaines and

Peeres haue had authoritie to subscribe in Councell, haue not Emperours and kinges the like authoritie?
            Truely there hadde been no neede to handle so plaine a matter as this is, with so many wordes and so at length, if wee hadde not to doe with those menne who for a desire they haue to striue and to winne the mastery, vse of course to deny all thinges be thei neuer so cleere, yea the very same which they presentlye see and beholde with their owne eyes. The Emperour Iustinian made a law to correct the behauiour of ye Cleargie, and to cutt shorte the insolencie of the priestes. And albeit hee were a Christian and a Catholique prince, yet putte hee downe from their Papall Throne, twooe Popes, Syluerius and Vigilius, not withstandinge they were Peters successours, and Christes vicars.
            Lette vs see then, suche men as haue authoritie ouer the Bysshoppes, suche menne as receaue from God commaundementes

concerning Religion, suche as brynge home againe the Arke of God, make holy hymnes, ouer see the preistes, builde the Temple, make Orations touching diuine seruice, clense the Temples, destroye the hil Aultres, burne the Idolles groues, teache the preistes their dewtie, write them out Preceptes how they should lyue, kill the wicked Prophetes, displace the high Preistes, call togyther the Councelles of Byshops, sit togither wich the Byshoppes, instructing them what they ought to doe, condemne and punysh an Hereticall Byshop, be made acquaynted with matters of Religion, whiche subscribe and giue sentence, and do al these things, not by an other mans Commissiō, but in their own name, and that both vprightly and godly. Shall we say it perteineth not to suche men to haue to do with Religion? or shall wee saye, a Christian Magistrate whyche dealith amongest others in these maters doth either naughtelie, or presumpteouslye,

or wickedlye? The moste aunciente and Christian Emperoures and kinges that euer were, didde busy themselus with these matters, and yet were they neuer for this cause noted eyther of wickednesse or of presumption. And what is hee that canne finde oute either more catholique princes or more notable exaumples?
            Wherefore yf it were lawfull for them to dooe thus beinge but Ciuile Magistrates, and hauinge the chiefe rule of common weales, what offence haue oure Princes at thys daye made, whiche maye not haue leaue to dooe the lyke, beinge in the like degree? Or what especiall gifte of learninge or of iudgemente, or of holynes, haue these menne nowe, that contrarye to the custome of all the aunciente and Catholique Bysshoppes, who vsed to conferre with princes and peeres concerning religiō, thei do now thus reiect and cast of

Christian Princes from knowing of the cause, and from their meetinges?
            Well thus doinge, they wiselye and warelye prouide for them selues and for their kingedome, whiche otherwise they see is like shortly to come to naught. For if so be, they whom God hath placed in greatest dignitie, didde see and perceiue these mennes practises, howe Christes commaundementes be despised by them, how the light of the Gospell is darkened and quenched out by them, & how themselues also be subtilly begiled and mocked and vnwares be deluded by them, & the way to ye kingedom of heauē stopped vp before them, no doubt they would neuer so quietlye suffer them selues neyther to be disdaigned after suche a prowde sorte, nor so dispitefully to be scorned and abused by them. But nowe through their own lacke of vnderstanding, & through their owne blyndenesse, these menne haue them fast yoked▪ and in their daunger.
            
               We truely for our parts, as we haue sayd, haue don nothing in altering Religion, either vpon rashenes or arrogantie, nor nothing but with good leasure and great consideration. Neyther had we euer intended to do it, except both the manifeste and most assured will of God opened to vs in his holy scriptures, and the regarde of our owne saluation had euen constreyned vs there vnto. For though wee haue departed from that Churche which these menne call catholique, and by that meanes gett vs enuy amongest them that want skill to iudge, yet is this ynough for vs, and it ought to be ynough for euery wise and good man, and one that maketh accoumpte of euerlasting lyfe, that we haue gon from that Church whiche had power to erre, whiche Christ, who cannot erre, tolde so long before it should erre, and which we our selues did euidently see with our eyes to haue gon both from ye holy Fathers and from the Apostles, and from Christ

his own selfe & from the primatiue & catholique churche: and wee are come as nere as we possibly could to the Church of the Apostles and of the old catholique Byshops and Fathers, whiche Churche we knowe hath hetherunto ben sounde and perfite, and as Tertullian termeth it, a pure virgine spotted as yet with no Idolatrie, nor with any foule or shamefull faulte: and haue directed according to their customes and ordinaunces not onely our doctrine, but also the Sacraments & the fourme of common prayer.
            And as we knowe both Christe hym selfe and all good men here to fore haue don, we haue called home againe to the originall and first foundation that Religion which hath ben fowly forslowed & vtterly corrupted by these men. For wee thought it mere thence to take ye paterne of reforminge Religion, from whence the ground of Religion was first taken, Bycause this one reasone, as saythe the most auncient Father Tertullian, hath

great force againste all Heresies. Looke what soeuer was first, that is trew: and what soeuer is latter, that is corrupt. Ireneus oftentimes appealed to ye oldest Churchs, which had ben nerest to Christes time, and which it was hard to beleue had erred. But whye at this daye is not the same respect and consideratiō had? Whye returne wee not to the paterne of the ould Churches? whye maye not we heare at this time amongst vs ye same saiing which was opēly pronounced in times past in the Councel at Nice by so many Byshopes and Catholique Fathers, and nobody once speakyng againste it.

            The Prophet Aggeus, after the Tē
               ple was repaired againe by Esdras, and the people mighte thinke they had a very iuste cause to reioyce on their own behalfe, for so great a benefit receiued of almightie God, yet made he them al burst out in teares, bycause that they whyche were yet aliue, and had sene the former building of the Temple before the Babylonians destroyed it, called to mynde how far of it was yet from that beautie and excellencie whiche it had in the olde

times past before. For thē in deed would they haue thought ye Temple worthely repaired, yf it had aunswered to the auncient paterne, and to the maiestie of the first Temple. Paul bycause he wold amende the abuse of the Lordes supper which ye Corinthians euen then begonne to corrupte, he sett before them Christes institution to folow, sayng: I haue deliuered vnto you ye which I firste receiued of the Lord. And when Christ dyd confute the errour of the Pharisees, Ye must, saith he, retorne to the first beginning, for frō the beginning yt was not thus. And when he founde great faulte with ye preists for their vncleanes of lyfe and couetousnes, and woulde clense the Temple from al euil abuses, This house saith he, at ye first beginning was a house of praier, wherin all the people myght deuoutely and sincerely praye together, and so were your partes to vse it nowe also at this daye. For it was not builded to thende it should be a denne of theues.

Likewise al the good and commendable Princes mentioned of in the Scriptures, were praised, specially by those wordes that they had walked in the wayes of their Father Dauid. That is bycause they had retorned to the first and originall foundation, and had restored Religion euen to the perfection wherin Dauid left it. And therfore whē we likewise sawe all thing es were quite trodden vnder foote of these men, and that nothing remained in the Temple of God but piteful spoyles and decayes, we reckened it the wisest and the safest waye to sett before our eyes those Churches which we knew for a suerty that they neuer had erred, nor neuer had priuate Masse, nor prayers in straynge and Barbarous language, nor this corrupting of Sacramentes and other toyes.
            And forsomuche as our desire was to haue the Temple of the Lord restored a new, we would seke no other foundatiō, then the same which we knew was long

agone layde by the Apostles, that is to wyte, our sauiour Iesu Christ. And forsomuch as we heard God hym selfe speaking vnto vs in his word, and sawe also the notable Examples of the oulde and primatiue Churche: againe how vncertaine a mater it was to wait for a generall Coucell, and that the successe therof woulde be muche more vncertaine, but specially for so muche as we were moste ascerteined of Goddes will, and counted it a wickednes to be to careful and ouercumbred about the iudgementes of mortall menne, we could no longer stand takyng aduise with fleshe and bloud, but rather thought good to do ye same thing that doth might rightlye be don, & hath also many a time ben don aswel of good men as of many catholique Byshopes: that is, to remedie our own Churches by a Prouinciall Synode. For thus know we the ould Fathers vsed to putt in experience before they came to the publique vniuersal Coūcel. There remaine

yet al this daye Canons writen in Coū
               celles of free Cities, as of Carthage vnder Cypriā, as of Ancyra, of Neocesaria and of Gangra, also whiche is in Daphlagonia as some thinke, before that ye name of the generall Councel at Nice was euer heard of. After this fashion in olde time did they spedely meet with, and cut short those Heretiques ye Pelagians & the Donatistes at home with priuate disputation, without any general Councell. Thus also when the Emperour Constantius euidētly and earnestly toke part with Auxentius the Byshop of the Aerians faction, Ambrose the Byshopp of the Christians appealed not vnto a generall Councel, where he saue no good could be don

                Synode. And thus it was decreed in the Councell at Nice, that the Byshop

it was decreed, that the Bysshops shoulde meete togeather in eche of their prouinces, at least once in the year, which was done as saith the Councel at Chal

               undus and Palladius reiected the Coū
               cell at Aquila, bicause it was not a generall and a common Councell, Ambrose Bysshoppe of Millaine made aunswere, that no man ought to take it for a newe or straunge matter that the Bysshops of the weste parte of the worlde didde call togeather Synodes, and make priuate assemblies in their Prouinces, for that it was a thing before then vsed by the west Bysshoppes no fewe times, and by the Bysshoppes of Grecia vsed oftentymes and cōmonly to be done. And so Charles the great being Emperour, held a prouinciall Councell in Germanie, for puttinge

awaye Images, contrary to the seconde Councell at Nice. Neither pardy euen amongest vs is this so very a straunge and newe a trade: for we haue hadde ere nowe in Englande prouinciall Synods, and gouerned oure Churches by home made lawes. What shoulde one saye more? of a truthe euen those greatest Councelles, and where moste assemblie of people euer was (wherof these menne vse to make suche an exceedinge reckeninge) compare them with all the Churches whiche throughout the worlde acknoweledge and professe the name of Christe, and what els I praye you can they seeme to bee, butte certaine priuate Councelles of Bysshoppes, and prouinciall Synodes? For admitte peraduenture, Italie, Fraunce, Spaine, England, Germanie, Denmarke, and Scotlande meete togithers, yf there want Asia, Grecia, Armenia, Persia, Media, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, and Mauritania, in all whiche places

there bee bothe manye Christian menne and also Bysshoppes, howe canne anye man, beinge in his right mynde, thinke suche a Councel to bee a generall Councell? or where so manye partes of the worlde doe lacke, howe canne they truelye saye, they haue the consente of the whole worlde? Or what manner of Councell, weene you, was the same last at Trident? Or howe might it bee tearmed a generall Councell, when out of all Christian kyngedomes and Nations, there came vnto it butte onelye fourtye Bysshoppes, and of those some so cunninge, that they might be thought meete to bee sente home againe to learne their Grammar, and so well learned, that thei had neuer studied Diuinitie?
            What so euer it bee, the truthe of the Gospell of IESVS CHRIST dependeth not vpon Councelles, nor as S. Pawle saithe, vpon mortall creatures iudgementes. And if they whiche ought to be carefull for Gods Churche,

will not be wyse but slacke their duety, and harden their heartes against Godde and his Christe, goinge on still to peruert the right wayes of the Lorde, God will stirre vp the very stones, and make children and babes cunninge, whereby there may euer be some to confute these mennes lyes. For God is able (not onely without Councelles, butt also will the Councelles nill the Councelles) to maintaine and auaunce his owne kingedom. Full manye bee the thoughtes of mans heart (saith Salomon) but the counsell of the Lorde abydeth stedfast. There is no wisedome, there is no knowledge, there is no counsell against the Lorde. Thinges endure not, saithe Hilarius, that be set vp with mennes workemanship: By an other manner of meanes must the Churche of God be builded and preserued, for that Churche is grounded vpon the foundacion of the Apostles and Prophets, and is holden fast togeather by one corner stone, which is Christ

Iesu.
            But merueilous notable and to very good purpose for these dayes bee Niecomes wordes: Whosoeuer (sayth hee) the Diuell hathe deceiued and enticed to fall a sleepe as it were with the sweete & deathly enchaūtments of ye marmaids the Sirenes,

                the Apostles and the Euangelistes:

And when the people shall flee for succour to suche hilles, and shall bee exercised in the reading of those kind of mountaynes, though they finde not one to teache them (for the haruest shall bee greate, butte the labourers fewe) yet shall the good desire of the people bee well accepted, in that they haue gotten them to suche hilles, and the neglygence of their maisters shall bee openly reproued. These bee Hieromes sayenges, and that so playne, as there needeth no Interpretour. For they agree so iuste with the thinges wee nowe see wyth oure eyes haue already come to passe, yt wee maye verelye thinke hee mente to foretell, as it were by the spirite of prophesie, and to paincte before oure face the vniuersall state of oure tyme, the fall of the moste gorgeous harlotte Babylon, the repairinge againe of Goddes Churche, the blyndenesse and slewthe of the Bysshoppes, and the good will and forwardenesse of the people. For

who is so blinde that hee seeth not these menne bee the maisters, by whome the people, as saythe Hierome, hathe been ledde into errour, and lulled a sleepe? Or who seeth not Rome, that is their Niniue, whiche sometime was paineted wt fairest colours, but now her vizer being pulled of, is both better seen and lesse sette by? Or who seeth not that good menne beinge a waked as it were out of their deade sleepe, at the lighte of the Gospell, and at the voyce of God, haue resorted to the hilles of the Scriptures, waiting not at all for the Councelles of suche maisters?
            Butte by your fauoure, some will saye, These thinges ought not to haue been attempted without the Bysshoppe of Romes commaundement, forsomuche as hee onely is the knotte and bande of Christian societie: he onely is that priest of Leuies order, whom God signified in the Deuteronomy, from whom counsell

in matters of weight and true iudgemēt ought to be fetched, and who so obeyeth not his iudgement, the same man ought to bee killed in the sight of his brethren: and that no mortall creature hathe authoritie to bee iudge ouer him whatsoeuer hee dooe: that Christe reigneth in heauen and hee in earthe: that hee alone canne dooe as muche as Christe, or God hym selfe canne dooe, bicause Christ and hee haue but one Councell house: That without him is no faythe, no hope, no churche, and who so goeth from him, quite casteth awaye and renounceth his owne saluation. Suche talke haue the Canonistes, the Popes parasites surely, but with small discretion or sobrenesse: for they coulde stant saye more, at leaste they coulde not speake more highlye of Christe him selfe.
            As for vs truely, we haue fallen from the Byshoppe of Rome vpon no maner of worldlye respect or commoditie, and woulde to Christe hee so behaued himselfe,

as this falling away neded not: but so the case stoode, that oules we left him, wee could not come to Christ. Neyther will he now make any other league wt vs, then suche a one as Nahas the kyng of the Ammonites would haue made in tymes past with thē of the citie of Jabes,1. Reg

                whiche was to put out the right eye of eche one of the Inhabitantes. Euen so will the Pope pluck from vs the holye Scripture, the Gospell of our saluation, and all the confidence which we haue in Christ Iesu. And vpon other condition can he not agree vpon peace with vs.
            For wheras som vse to make so great a vaunte, that the Pope is onely Peters Successour, as though therby he carried the holy Ghost in his bosome & cannot erre, this is but a matter of nothing and a very trieflyng tale. Gods grace is promised to a good mynde, and to one that fearith God, not vnto Sees and Successiōs. Riches saith Ierome, may make a Byshop to be of more might then the

rest: but all the Byshoppes whosoeuer they be, are the Successours of the Apostles. Yf so be, the place and consecrating onely be sufficient (why then) Manasses succeded Dauid, and Caiphas succeded Aaron. And it hath ben often seene, that an Idoll hath stand in the Temple of God. In old tyme Archidamus the Lacedemonian boasted muche of hym selfe, how he came of the bloud of Hercules, but one Nicostratus in thys wise abated his prydes Nay, quod he, yu semest not to descende from Hercules, for Hercules destroied yll men, but thou makest good men euill. And when the Pharises bragged of their linage how they wereof ye kynred and bloud of Abraham, Ye saith Christ, seeke to kyll me, a manne whiche haue toulde you the trouth as I heard it from God: thus Abraham neuer did. Ye are of your Father the dyuel, and wil nedes obey his will.
            Yet notwithstandyng, bycause wee will graunt somewhat to succession, tell

vs, hath the Pope alone succeded Peter▪ and wherein I praye you, in what Religion? in what Office? in what peece of his lyfe hath he succeded hym? What one thing (tel me) had Peter euer like vnto the Pope? or the pope lyke unto Peter? excepte paraduenture they will saye thus: that Peter when he was at Rome, neuer taught the Gospell, neuer fedde ye flock, toke away the keyes of the kingedom of heauē, hyd the treasures of his Lorde, satte him downe onely in his Castle in S. Iohn Laterane, & poincted out with his finger al the places of Purgatorie, and kyndes of punyshementes, cōmittyng some poore soules to be tormented, and other some againe sodenlye

               leasing thence at his owne pleasure, taking money for so doing: or that he gaue order to say priuate Masses in euery cornere or that be mumbled vp the holy seruice with a lowe voice and in an vnknowen language, or that he hāged vp ye Sacrament in euery Tēple and on euerie Aulter, and caryed ye same about before

hym whether soeuer he went, vpon an ambling Iennett, with lightes and belles: or that he consecrated with hys holy breath, oyle, war, wulle, belles, chalices, churches & aultres: or that he solde Iubilees, graces, liberties, aduousons, preuentions, first fruits, Palles, the wearing of Palles, bulles, Indulgences and pardons: or that he called hym self by the name of the head of the Churche, The highest Byshop, Byshop of Byshopps, alone Most holy: or that by vsurping he tooke vpon hym selfe the right and aucthoritie ouer other folkes Churches: or that he exempted him selfe frō the power of anye civilie gouernement: or that he mainteined warr

of noble menne. These things no doubt did Peter at Rome in times past, and left them in charge to his Successours as you would say, from hand to hande: for these thinges be now a dayes donne at Rome by the Popes, and be so done, as though nothing els ought to be don.
            Or contrarie wise paraduenture they had rather saye thus, that the Pope doth now all the same thinges whyche wee knowe Peter did many a daye a goe: that is, that he rounneth vp and downe into euerye Countreye to Preache the Gospell, not onelye openlye abroad, but also priuatelye from house to house: that hee is diligente, and applyeth that busines in seasone and out of seasone, in dewe tyme, out of dew time: that he doth the part of an Euangelist, that he fulfilleth the worke and ministerie of Christ, that he is ye watcheman of the house of Israel: receaueth answeares and wordes at Goddes mouth: and euen as hereceiueth them, so deliuereth them ouer

to the people: That he is the salte of the earth: That he ys the light of the world, that he doth not feed his owne selfe but his flock, that he doth not entangle him selfe with the worldlie eares of this lyfe, that he doth not vse a soueraintye ouer the Lordes people, that he seeketh not to haue other menne minister to hym, but him selfe rather to minister vnto others, that he taketh al Bishops as his felows and equals: that he is subiect to Princes as to personnes sent from God, that he giueth to Cesar that whiche is Cesars: and that he as the old Bishops of Rome dyd (without any question) calleth the Emperour his Lord: Onles therfore the Popes do the like now a dayes, and Peter did the thinges a foresayd, there is no cause at all why they should glorye so of Peters name and of his succession.
            Muche lesse cause haue they to complaine of our departing, and to call vs againe to be felowes and frendes with them, and to beleue as they beleue. Men

saye that one Cobdon a Lacedemonian, when he was sent Embassadour to the kyng of the Persians to treate of a legue, and founde by chaunce them of the court playng at dyce, he returned streight waye home againe, leauing his message vndone. And whē he was asked why he did flacke to doe the thinges whiche he had receiued by publique commission to do, he made aunswere, he thought it should be a great reproche to his cōmon welthe, to make a legue with Dicers. But yf we should content our selues to retorne to the Pope and his popyshe errours, and to make a couenaunte not only with dicers, but also with men farr
                  •
                more vngracious and wicked then any dycers be: Besides that this should be a great blot to our good name, it shoulde also be a very daungerous matter both to kindle Goddes wrath against be, and to clogge and condemne our owne soules foreuer. For of very trouthe we haue departed from hym whome we saw had

blinded the whole worlde this many an hundred yeare. From hym who to farre presumpteouslye was wont to saye, he coulde not erre, and whatsoeuer he dyd no mortal man had power to condemne hym, neyther kynges nor Emperours, nor the whole Clergie, nor yet all the people in the worlde togyther, no and though he should carrie away with hun to Hell a thousande soules. From hym who toke vpon him power to cōmaund not only menne but euen Goddes Aungels, to go, to returne, to leade soules into Purgatorie, and to bring them back againe when he lyste him selfe: whome Gregory said, with out all doubt is the very foreronner and standerd bearer of Antichrist, and hath vtterly forsaken the catholique faith: From whome also those ringeleaders of owers, who now with might and maine resist ye Gospel, & the trouth whiche they knowe to be the truth, haue or this departed euery one of their owne accorde and good will, and

woulde euen now also gladly depart fró hyin, yf the note of inconstancie & shame and their owne estimacion amonge the people were not a let vnto them. In conclussion, wee haue departed from hym to whom we wer not bound, and who had nothyng to laye for hym selfe, but onely I know not what vertue or power of the place where he d'weleth, and a continuaunce of seccession.
            And as for vs, we of all others moste iustely haue left him. For our Kynges, yea euen they whiche with greatest reuerence dyd folow and obey the aucthoritie and faith of the Byshops of Rome, haue long synce founde and felte well ynough the yoke & tyrannye of the Popes kingdome. For ye Byshops of Rome toke the Crowne of from the head of our Kynge Henrye the second, and compelled him to put a side all maiestie, and lyke a meere priuate man to come vnto their Legate with great submission and humilitie, so as all his subjectes might

laugh him to scorne. More thē this, they caused Byshops and Monkes and some parte of the nobilitie to be in the feelde against our Kynge Iohn, and sett all the people at libertie from their othe wherby they ought allegeaunce to their king: and at last, wickedly and most abhominablie they bereaued the kyng not onely of his kyngdome, but also of his lyfe. Besides this, they excommunicated and cursed Kyng Henry theight, the most famous Prince, & stirred vp against him sometime the Emperour, sometime the Frenche Kyng, & as muche as in them was, putte in aduenture our Realme to haue ben a very praye and spoyle. Yet were they but foules and mad, to thinke that eyther so mighty a Prince could be scared with bugges and rattles: or els ye so noble and great a kyngdome myght so easily, euen at one morsel be deuoured and swalowed vp.
            And yet as though all this were to litle, they would nedes make all the Realme

tributarie to them, & exacted there yearely most vniust and wrongfull taxes. So deere cost vs the freendeshyp of the Citie of Rome. Wherefore yf they haue gotten these thinges of vs by extortion thorough their fraude and suttle sleightes, we see no reason why we may not plucke awaye the same from them againe by laufull wayes & iust means. And yf out kynges in that darknes and blindenes of former tymes gaue them these thinges of their owne accorde and liberalitie for Religion sake, being moued with a certaine opinion of their fained holines, now when ignoraunce & errour is spied out, may the Kinges their successours take them awaye againe, seing they haue the same auctoritie, the Kinges their auncestours had before. For the gyft is voide, except it be alowed by the will of the giuer: and that cannot seme a perfit will, which is dymmed and hindered by errour.
            Thus ye see good Christian Reader,

howe it is no new thing, though at this day the religion of Christ be enterteined with dispites and checkes, being but lately restored and as it were comming vp againe a new, for somuche as the lyke hath chaunced both to Christ hym selfe and to his Apostles: yet neuerthelesse for feare ye maye suffer your selfe to be led amysse and seduced with those exclamations of our Aduersaries, we haue declared at large vnto you ye very whole maner of our Religion, what our opinion is of God the Father, of his onely sonne Iesus Christ, of the holy Ghost, of the Church, of the Sacramentes, of the ministery, of ye Scriptures, of ceremonies, and of euery parte of Christian beleue. Wee haue sayde that wee abandon and detest as plagues and poysons all those oide? Heresies, whiche eyther the sacred Scriptures or the auncient Councelles haue vtterly condemned: that wee call home againe asmuche as euer wee can, the right Discipline of ye Church, which

our Aduersaries haue quite brought into a poore & weake case: That we punnishe all licentiousnes of lyfe and vnrulynes of maners by the olde and long continued laws, and with asmuch sharpenes as is conuenient and lyeth in our power: That we mainteine still the state of kingdomes, in the same condition and plight wherin we haue found thē, without any diminishing or alteration, reseruinge vnto our Princes their maiestie and worldly preeminence safe and without empayring, to our possible power: That we haue so gottē our selues away from that Church which they had made a denne of Theeues, and wherein nothing was in good frame or once like to the Churche of God, and whiche them selfes cōfessed had erred many weies, euē as Lott in times paste gat hym out of Sodom, or Abraham out of Caldie, not vpō a desire of contention, but by ye warninge of God him selfe: And yt we haue searched out of ye holy Bible whiche we are sure cannot deceiue, one sure fourme

of Religion, and haue retorned againe vnto the Primatiue Churche of the auncient Fathers and Apostles, that is to say, to the first ground and beginning of thinges, as vnto the very foundations & head springes of Christes church. And in very troth we haue not carried for in this matter the auctoritie or consent of the Trident Councell, wherein we sawe nothing don vprightly nor by good ordre: where also euery body was sworne to the maintenaunce of one man: where our Princes Embassadours were contemned: where not one of oure diuines could be heard, and where partes taking and ambition was openly and earnestlye procured and wrought, but as the holy Fathers in former time, and as our predecessours haue commonly don, wee haue restored our Churches by a Prouinciall Conuocation, and haue cleane shaken of as our dewtie was, the yoke and tyrannye of the Byshop of Rome, to whome we were not bounde, who also

had no manner of thying lyke neyther to Christ nor to Peter, nor to an Apostle, nor yet like to any Byshopp at all. Finally, we saye that wee agree amongest our selues, touching the whole iudgemēt and chiefe substaunce of Christian Religion, and with one mouth and with one spirite do woorshipp God and the Father of our Lord Iesu Christ.
            Wherefore O Christian and godlye Reader, forsomuche as thow seest the reasons and causes both whye wee haue restored Religion, and whye wee haue forsaken these men, thou oughtest not to maruaile, though wee haue chosen to obeye our Maister Christe rather then menne. Paule hath giuen vs warning how we shoulde not suffer our selues to be carried away with suche sundry learninges, and to fly their companies, in especiall whiche woulde sowe debate and variaunces, cleane contrarie to the Doctrine whithe they had receiued of Christ and the Apostls. Longe synce haue these

mennes craftes and treacheries decaied and vanished and fled away at the sight and light of ye Gospell, euen as the owle doth at the sunne rysing. And albeit their trumperye be builte vp and reared as highe as the Skye, yet euen in a momēt and as yt were of the owne selue fallyth yt downe againe to the ground, and cō
               meth to naught. For you must not think yt al these things haue com to passe rashly or at aduēture: It hath ben gods pleasure yt against al mennes willes wel nye, the Gospell of Iesu Christe shoulde be spread abroad thorough out the whole worlde, at these dayes. And therfore men folowing godds biddings, haue of their owne free will resorted vnto the Doctrine of Iesus Christ. And for our parts truely wee haue sought hereby neyther glorie nor welthe, nor pleasure nor ease. For there is plentie of all these thinges with our aduersaryes. And when wee wer of their side, we enioyed such worldlye commodyties muche more liberallie

and bountefullye, then wee doe nowe. Neyther doe wee eschew concorde and peace, but to haue peace with man, wee will not be at warre with God. The name of peace is a swete and pleasaunte thinge, saith Hilarius: But yet beware, sayth he, peace is one thinge, and boundage is an other. For yf it shoulde so be as they seeke to haue it, that Christe shoulde be commaunded to keepe silence, that the truth of the Gospell should be betraied, that horrible errours should be cloked, that Christian mennes eyes shold be bleared, & that they might be suffred to conspire openlye against God: this were not a peace, but a moste vngodlye couenaunt of seruitude. There is a peace saith Nazianzene, that is vnprofitable: againe there is a discorde saith he, that is profitable. For we muste conditionallye desire peace, so farre as is laufull before God, & so farre as we may conueniētly. For otherwise Christ him self broughte not peace into the worlde, but a sworde.

Wherefore yf the Pope will haue vs re
               
                  •
               onciled to hym, his dewty is first to be reconciled to God: for from thence saith Cyprian, spring schysmes and sectes, bycause menne seeke not the head, and haue not their recourse to the Fountaine of ye Scriptures, and kepe not the Rules gyuen by the heauenly teacher: for saith he, 
                  •
               hat is not peace but warre: neyther is he ioyned vnto the Churche which is seuered from the Gospel. As for these men 
                  •
               hey vse to make a marchaundize of the name of peace. For that peace whiche they so faine would haue, is onely a rest of idle bellies. They and we might easily be brought to atonement touchyng all the

               ellyes. Many a day a go and in the old worlde, a wonderfull great aduantage grew hereby to these kinde of people, but now they recken all is losse vnto them that Christ gaigneth. The Pope hym selfe maketh greate complaynere at this present, that Charitie in people is waxen coulde. And why so trow ye? Forsooth because his profittes decaye more and more. And for this cause doth he hale vs into hatred all that euer he maye, laieng lode vpon vs with dispitetfull raylings and condemning vs for Heretiques, to thende they that vnderstande not the matter, maye thinke there be no woorse menne vpon earth then we be. Notwithstanding we in the meane season are neuer the more ashamed for all this: neyther ought we to be ashamed of ye Gospell: for wee sett more by the glorie of

God then wee doe by the estimation of menne. Wee are suere all is true that we teach, and we may not either go against our owne conscience, or beare any witnes against God. For yf we denye any part of the Gospel of Iesu Christ before menne, he on the other side wil denye vs before his Father. And yf there be anye that will still be offended and cannot endure Christes doctrine, suche saye wee, be blynd &, leaders of ye blynde: the truth neuertheles must be preached and preferred aboue all: and wee muste with patience wayte for Goddes iudgement. Lett these folke in the meane tyme take good heed what they do, and let them be well aduised of their owne Saluation, and cease to hate and persecute the Gospell of the sonne of God, for feare least they feele hym once a redresser and reuē

                  de, and be well hable to instruct the people in ye holy scriptures.
               Euery one of the Archebyshops and Byshops haue their seuerall Cathedrall churches. Wherein ye deanes beare chiefe rule, being men specially chosen both for their learning and godlines, as neere as maye bee.
               
                  These Cathedrall Churches haue also other dignities and Canōries, whervnto bee assigned no ydle or vnprofitable persones, but suche as eyther bee Preachers, or professours of the Sciences of good learninge.
               In the saide Cathedrall Churches, vpon Sondayes and festiuall dayes, the Canons make ordinarilye special Sermons, wherevnto duely resorte the head Officers of the Cities and the Citizens: and vpon the workendayes thryse in the weeke, one of the Canons doth read and expound some peece of holy Scripture.
               Also the saide Archebyshops and Bysshops haue vnder them their Archedeacons, some two, some foure, some sixe, accordinge to the largenes of the dioces, the whiche Archedeacons keepe yearly twoo visitations, wherein they make diligent inquisition, and searche both of the doctrine and behauiour as well of the ministers as of the people. They punishe

thoffendors: and if any errours in religion and heresies fortune to springe, thei bring those and other weighty matters before the Byshops themselues.
               There is nothing read in oure Churches but the canonical scriptures, which is done in suche ordre, as that the Psalter is read ouer euery moneth, the new Testament foure times in the yeare, and the olde Testament once euery yeare. And if the Curate be iudged of ye Byshop to be sufficiently seene in the holy scripturs, he dothe withal make some exposition and exhortacion vnto godlines.
               And for somuch a

                   our Churches and Vniuersities haue ben wōderfully marred, and so souly brought out of al fashion in time of papistrie, as there can not be had learned pastors for euery parysh, there bee prescribed vnto the Curates of meaner vnderstandinge, certaine Homelies deuised by learned men, whiche doe comprehende the principall poinctes of

Christian doctrine: as of Originall sin, of Iustification, of Faith, of Charitie, & suche like, for to bee read by them vnto the people.
               As for Common prayer, The lessons taken out of the Scriptures, thadministringe of the sacramentes, and the residue of seruice done in the Churches, are euery whitt done in the vulgare tongue whiche all may vnderstande.
            
            
               Touchinge the vniuersities.
               Moreouer, this Realme of England hathe twoo Vniuersities,

                     Cambridge and
                     Oxforde.
                  
               
               And the manner is not to liue in these within houses that be Innes or a receipt for common geastes, as is the custome of some vniuersities, but they liue in colledges vnder moste graue and seuere discipline, euen suche as the famous learned man Erasmus of Roterodame, beinge heere amongest vs about fourtie yeares

past, was bolde to preferre before ye very rules of the Monkes.
               
                  In Cambridge bee xiiii Colledges, these by name that folowe.

                     And besides these Colledges that be in the Vniuersities, this Realme hath also certein collegiate churches, as Westmynster, Windesour, Eaton, and Wynchester. The two last whereof do bring vp and fynde a greate number of yong Scholers, the whiche after they be once parfect in the rules of Grammer and of versifieng, and well entred in the principles of the Greeke tong and of Rhetorike, are sent from thence vnto the vniuersities: as thus. Out of Eaton colledge they be sent vnto the Kynges colledge at Cambrydge, & out of Wynchester, vnto the New colledge at Oxford.
                  The Colledges of both the Vniuersities be not only very fayre and goodly builte thorough thexceding liberalitie of ye kynges in olde time & of late dayes, of Byshopps and of noble men, but they be also endowed with marueylous large liuinges and reuenewes.
                  In Trinitie colledge at Cambrydge,

and in Christes colledge at Oxford, both whiche were founded by Kyng Henry theight of most famous memorie, are at the least founde foure hundreth Shollers: and the like number wel neere is to be seene in certen other Colledges, as in the Kynges Colledge & S. Iohns Colledge at Cambrydge: in Magdalene colledge and New colledge of Oxford: besides the rest which we now passe ouer.
                  Euery one of the Colleges haue their Professours of the tonges and of the liberal Sciences (as they cal them) which do trade vp youth priuatly whithin their Halles, to thend they may afterward be able to go furth thence into the common scholes as to open disputatiō, as it were into plain battail, there to try themselfe.
                  In the cōmon Scholes of both the Vniuersities, there are found at the Kinges charge, and that very largely, fyue Professours & Readers, that is to saye,

                        
                        The Reader of Diuinitie.
                        The Reade
                              •
                            of the Ciuill lawe.
                        The Reader of Physike.
                        The Reader of the Hebrewe tongue. and
                        The Reader of the Greeke tongue.
                     
                  
                  And for the other Professours, as of Phylosophie, of Logique, of Rethorike, and of the Mathematicalles, the Vniuersities themselues doe allowe stipendes vnto them. And these Professours haue the ruling of the Disputaciōs and other schole exercises whiche be dayly vsed in the common Scholes: Amongest whome, they that by the same Disputations & exercises are thought to be come to any tipenes in knowledge, are wont according to ye vse in other vniuersities, soleniply to take degrees, euery one in ye same science and facultie which he professeth.
                  Wee thought good to annexe these thinges, to thende wee might confute &

confounde those that spread abroad rumours, how yt with vs nothinge is don in order & as ought to be don: yt there is no Religiō at al, no Ecclesiastical Discipline obserued, no regard had of the saluacion of mennes soules, but that all is don quite out of ordre and seditiouslye, yt all antiquitie is despised, that libertie is giuen to all sensualitie and lewde lustes of folkes, that the liuings of the Church be conuerted to prophane and worldlye vses, wheras in very trouth we seke nothing els but that, that God aboue all moste good, may haue still his honoure truely and purely reserued vnto hym, that the rule and waye to euerlastinge Saluacion maye be taken from out of his very word, and not from mens fantasies, that the Sacramentes maye be ministred not like a Maskary or a stage playe, but religiously and reuerently according to the rule prescribed vnto vs by Christ, and after the example of the holy Fathers whiche florished in the primatiue

Churche: that that most holye and godly fourme of discipline, whiche was commonly vsed amongest them, may be called home againe: that the goodes of ye Churche may not be laūched out amō
                     gest worldlinges & ydel persōs, but may be bestowed vpon the godlye Ministers and Pastours which take paine both in Preaching and teaching: that there may from tyme to tyme arise vp out of the Vniuersities learned & good ministers & others meete to serue ye cōmon welth: And finally, that all vncleane and wicked lyfe may be utterly abandoned and banyshed, as vnworthy for the name of any Christian. And albeit we are not as yet able to obteine this yt we haue said, fully & perfitlie, (for this same Stable, as one may rightly call it, of ye Romish Augias, cannot so soone be thorouglye cleansed and ridd from the long growen filth and mucke) neuerthelesse this is it whereunto we haue regarde: hether doe wee tende: to this marke do wee direct

our paine and trauaile, and that hitherto (thorough God his gracious fauour) not without good successe and plenteous encrease: whiche thing may easily appeere to euery body, yf either we be cō
                     pared with our own selues in what maner of case wee haue ben but few yeares synce, or els be compared with our false accusers, or rather our malicious slaunderours.
                  The Lorde defende his Churche, gouerne it with his holy Spirite, & blesse the same with all prosperous felicitie.
                  Amen.
