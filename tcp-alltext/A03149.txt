            TO THE MOST EXCELLENT PRINCE, CHARLES, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall and Yorke, Earle of Chester, &c.
            
               SIR,
            
            ACtion is the life of a Prince; speculation of a Scholler. In this you haue beene truely your selfe, and haue in person made it good: whereof we shall enioy the benefit, posterity the story. Those parts which other Princes haue visited only in a Map, you haue honoured with your owne survey; and seene more, then they haue read. To your Highnesse therefore, as the greatest and best accomplished traueller; doe I here present, what by speculation I haue attained vnto: my Little VVorld made bigger. Not that I presume to informe you, in any thing you knowe not; or confirme you in any thing you doubt. I am too sensible

of mine owne defects, to conceaue impossibilities. Only I desire, that vnder your G
                  ••
               
               cious protection others may peruse it, whom God hath made no lesse your inferiours in knowledge, then greatnesse. Such, perhaps, it may both delight, and satisfie: to your Highnesse it can doe no other seruice, then to set forth the lustre of your owne most iudicious obseruations. If I haue any ambition beyond this, it is but to expresse the zeale I beare to the true renowne of your Princely vertues: & the affection, duty, and reuerence, wherewith in all humilitie I subscribe my selfe
            
               
                  Your Highnesse most humbly deuote
                        •

I haue lately (good Reader) new-begotten him, and brought him to that strength and stature thou now soest. I am not the first of whom it was said, secundae cogitationes sunt meliores: neither is it a thing rare for children of this nature, to be as often perfected, as borne. Bookes haue an immortality aboue their Authors. They, when they are full of age, and guiltinesse, can be re-taken into the wombe which bred them: and with a new life, receaue a greater portion of youth and glory. Every impression is to them another being: and that alwaies may, and often doth bring with it, a sweeter addition of strength & louelinesse. Thus with them, age, & each seuerall death, is but an vsher to a new birth: each severall birth the mother of a more vigorous perfection. The truth is, in my former Edition of this worke, I dealt with pettie chapmen, pedlers of History and Geography: wit i

            At the first, there went to the making vp of this Little world, these six integrall parts, History, Geography, Policie, Theology, Chronologie, and Heraldrie. It is now enlarged in all those particulars, & in nothing is deficient which the other did afford thee, but the faults. To these I haue vpon diuerse occasions added diuerse Philologicall discourses; not much impertinent to the places, wherein they are inferred. At the worst, thou canst but call them

               Digressions; I am sure they are not Extrauagancies. Digred

            These additions and corrections haue swelled the volume bigger then I expected: yet if to thee the l

               t. It is now come to a iust growth, and hath receaued my last hand. Hereafter I will looke on it, only as a stranger. Thou needst not feare any future enlargements, which may make thee repent thy present markets. I haue now giuen ouer these younger studies; and, beleeue me, 'twas more then time: for I gazed so long on the porch, that I had almost forgotten to goe into the house. If euer I am induced to look further into it, it shall be only to amend such crimes, whereof a cleerer iudgement then mine owne can enforme me. For my part, I see not any: and when thou hast by the Errata corrected the Copy: I dare almost perswade my selfe, thou wilt (for materiall faults I meane) pronounce it, not guilty. Yet I exempt not my selfe from the common frailtie of nature; possibility of erring. Tis a misery from which his Holinesse, euen when he sitteth on his very Porphyry chaire, is not priuiledged. When by the strength of mine owne iudgement, or any ingenuous information, I am convicted: I will at once confesse my ouersight, and mend it.
            Thus haue I laid before thee, as in a Map, all that I haue performed, in this new creation of this Little world: in which I haue equally endeauoured thy good, and mine owne credit. To petition thy good opinion of my labours, is a thing infinitely below me. This were rather to extort commendation, then deserue it. Such requests are punished in themselues; and need no wretchednesse without them. The fauours they aime at, haue somewhat in them, common to ignoble quarrells, vbi & vincere inglorium est; & atteri, sordidum: and are not more infamous in the deniall, then the suit. A modest and voluntary acknowledgment of my industrie, I would gladly entertaine; but not invite. Guests of this qualitie, when they bid themselues, bring with them their owne welcome. When they come vpon entreatie, they come vnwillingly: and are not then receaued, but rauisht. Good Reader, iudge of me, as thou findest me worthie: for my selfe, I am neither ambitious of applause, nor afraid of censure. Giue me leaue so farre to be mine owne para

               If so, what needs my second Bush? 'Tis wast.
            
            
               Yet well thy choice Minerua merits this
               This Ivie-garland, euerlasting greene;
               Which like the Graces cup proportiond is,
               Where-out thou drink'st, wherein their Liquours beene.
               Nor wouldst thou scape the lash of Nemesis,
               
               If with Diogenes thou shouldst refuse
               To let the thirstie drinke there-hence, 'Twere newes.

               Tis slender Meede, yet who such pay disdaines?
               
                  Good wine may haue a Bush, though it need none.
               Nor let these lines of mine seeme partiall straines:
               Thy Worke ingenuous is: and Vertues brood,
               As it, increaseth with due praise. 'Tis good.

            THE GENERALL PRAECOGNITA OF GEOGRAPHIE.
            
               GEOGRAPHIE is (according to Ptolomey) an imitation of the picture of the whole Earth. But since the methode I intend to followe cannot bee confined within the limits of this briefe definition, it is requisite I should propose another of more large extent, which may be correspōdent to my purpose. Which before I will here set down, I will briefly explane certaine Geographicall notions, and rehearse some of her generall Praecognita. And since Ovid hath giuen mee so exact a methode, I cannot but make vse of it. The words are these with some little alteration. Met. lib. 2.

               A Continent is a great quantity of land, not separated by the Sea, in which many kingdomes and principalities are confined, and conioyned.
               An Iland (called in Latine Insula, quasi in salo) is a part of the earth enuironed round with waters, as Brittaine, Corsica, &c.

As concerning the situation of Ilands, whether commodious or not, this is my iudgement. I finde in Machiauell, that for a Citty whose people couet no Empire but their owne townes, a barren place is better then a fruitfull, because in such seats they are compelled to work and labour, by which they are free from idlenesse, and by consequence from vitiousnesse: but for a citty whose inhabitants desired to enlarge their confines, a fer

of the waies, he is not so well able to supply & keep such forces as he hath on the continent. An example hereof is England, which hath euen to admiration repelled the most puissant Monarch of Europe; but for the causes aboue named cannot shew any of her winnings on the firme land, though shee hath attempted and atchieued as many glorious exploits as any country in the world.

                  The Zones are spaces of earth, included betwixt two lesser circles. They are in number fiue, one ouer-hot, two ouer-cold, and two temperate.
               The ouer-hot, or Torrid Zone, is betwixt the two Tropickes, and continually scorched with the presence of the Sunne.
               The two ouer-cold, or Frigid Zones, are situate between the two Polare circles and the very Poles, continually wanting the neighbourhood of the Sunne.
               The two temperate Zones, are betwixt the Tropick of Cancer and the Articke; and twixt the Tropicke of Capricorne and the Antarticke circles; enioying an indifferency betweene heat, and cold: so that the parts next the Torrid Zone are the hotter; and the parts next the Frigid Zone are the colder.
               These fiue Zones are disposed according to the order of the Zones in heauen.

                  Parallels called also Aequidistants, circle the earth from East to West, and are commonly tenne degrees asunder. Such are the Parallels which are set downe in our Mappes and Globes. But there are another sort of Parallels, two of which goe to a Clime.
                  
These are called Artificiall Paralels, because they shew the differences of the artificiall daies. They are of vnequall breadth, as you shall see in the table following. The vfe of these latter Parallels, is to shew the Climats.
               A Clime is a space of the earth comprehended between two Parallels, or three lesser innominate circles: they serue to distinguish the length and brevity of the daies in all places. For vnder Aequator, the dayes are of the iust length of twelue houres; but after, in every clime they increase the length of hal

The climes toward the north were formerly knowne by the peculiar names, as Di

                     roes, Dia Sienes, &c. and the climes toward the South by the same names, only with the addition of Anti, as Anti Dia Meroes, and Anti Dia Sienes. Indeed the ancient Cosmographers made but 7 Climes, and some 9; neither needed they to adde more, since they knewe not the extent of the habitable world toward each Pole, so exactly as now we doe.
               Now because the climes are not of an equall latitude or extent, for which cause it is impossible to comprehend the nature of them in any rules generall or particular: I haue inserted this insuing Table, taken partly out of Clanius on Sacrobosco; and partly out of Mr 
                  Hues discourse of the vse of the Globes. It is divided into 7 columns. In the first is shewed what climes are inhabited by the Amphiscij, Heteroscij, and Periscij tearms which wee will presently expound: In the second is set downe the number of the climes themselues. In the third the number of the Parallels. In the fourth the length of the dayes in summer. In the fift the distance of every Climat and Parallel from the Aequator. In the sixt, the breadth and extent of every climat in it selfe. And in the seauenth, the name of the place through which the midst of the three circles, whereof every clime consisteth, doth passe.

Because it is a body not so heavy. 2. It is obserued by Saylers, that their ships fly faster to the shore then from it; whereof no reason can bee giuen, but the heighth of the water aboue the land. 3. To such as stand on the shore, the Sea seemeth to swell into the forme of an hill, till it putteth a bound to their sight. That the Sea houe

               The Northerne man is more strong, the Southerne more politicke; the Northerne more able, and the Southerne more couetous of veneriall combats, &c. Men also are (according as they are treated of in Geographie) diuided either in respect of their shadow,

                  Amphiscij are such as dwell betweene the two Tropickes, so called, because their shadowes tend both wayes: sometimes, (when the Sunne is North) to the South; sometimes (when the Sunne is South) to the North▪

                  Heteroscij are such as dwell in either of the two temperate Zones; so called, because their shadowes reach but one way; viz. in our Zone to the North onely, in the other to the South onely.
               
                  Antoeci are such as dwell vnder the same Meridian, and the same Latitude or parallel, equally distant from the Aequator: the one Northward, the other Southward; the dayes in both places being of a length; but the ones Summer being the others Winter.
               
                  Perioeci are such as dwell in the same parallel, on the same side of the Aequator, how distant soeuer they be East & West; the season of the yeare, and the length of dayes being to both alike, and the ones midnight, the others noone.

                  1. First then there is required to the magnificence of a city, a navigable riuer, or easie passage by Sea; by which there may be a continuall concourse of all kind of Merchants, as now at Venice, Amsterdam, London, Constantinople.
                  
                  2. The Palace of the Prince; for Vbi Imperator, ibi Roma, & where the Court is, there will continually be store of young Nobles to buy, and Tradesmen to sell vsuall commodities: as now Madrid in Spaine, growne from a meane Village, to a populous City, only by the Kings Court.
                  3. The residence of the Nobility which raiseth a City with stately and beautifull buildings: hence the Cities of Italy excell ours, their Nobles and Gentrie still liuing in the Cities, ours in the Villages, and priuate houses.
                  4. The Seate or Tribunal of Iustice, which inuiteth Lawyers and their Clients in abundance, to the great inriching of a City; as the Parliamentarie Cities in France doe euidently testifie, and Spiers in Germanie.
                  
                  5. Publique schooles of good literature, which summon the youth of the adjoyning Countries (as it were) to make their personall appearance, to the great benefite of a towne, as Paris well knoweth, and other townes haue felt.
                  6. Immunities from taxes and the like oppressions, which draw men from all quarters to inhabite there; their income being in such places greatest, their priuiledges most, and disbursing least; as in Naples, Florence, and Venice: which being almost desolate by a plague, were againe very suddenly peopled, by granting immunities to all commers.
                  7. Opinion of Sanctity, whether it be for relickes of Saints, for holy shrines, for the residence of some famous man, or for the seat of Religion, is not the least benefit for the inriching and inlarging of a citie: people (I meane the superstitious Papists) gr

               There are many other secundarie causes, as commodity of conduct, pleasantnesse of site, fruitfulnesse of soyle, and the like; which much further the populousnesse, riches, and flourishing beauty of Cities.
               For a generall example we need not go farre. Worcester hath a pleasant site, and fruitfull soyle, Bristoll a commodious Hauen, Oxford is a famous Vniuersity, and Yorke is a seat of Iustice; yet are all but of a meane compasse. But London hauing al the requisite conditions, lifteth vp a head of maiestie as high aboue the rest, as the Cypresse trees aboue the low shrubbes.

               FLVMINA.
               Riuers are said to be ingendred in the hollow concauities of the Earth,
                     Magirus.
                   & deriue both their birth & continuall sustenance from the Aire; which penetrating the open chinks or Chasma's of the Earth, and congealed by the extreame cold of that Element, dissolues into water (as we see the Aire in Winter nights to be melted into a pearlie dew, sticking on our glasse windowes) and being growne to some quantity, will) like Annibal in the Alpes) either find a way, or make a way to vent its superfluity. This beginning is seconded by the Ocean, which running through the hidden passages of the Earth, joyneth it selfe with this aëriall vapour, & continueth the begun current. This Seawater (though in it selfe of a salt and brackish sauour, yet passing through diuers windings & turnings of the Earth, is depriued of all vnpleasantnes: & by how much the Spring-heads of riuers are remote from the Sea, by so much are their waters affected with a delightfull rellish. Riuers hauing thus entred themselues in a good course, are neuer without the assistance of neighbouring springs & riuers, by whose addition they augment their waters, till they dischannell themselues into the Sea. Now there is of riuers a treble vse. First, that out of them, drink may be afforded to man and beast. Secondly, that running through the Earth, as blood through the body, by interlacing it, and sometimes ouerwhelming it, it might make the Earth able to produce those fruits which are necessary for the life of

man. The last vse of riuers is easiues & speedines of conduct, & hereto are required foure conditions. First the depth; because deep waters sustain the bigger burdens, & on them navigation is more safe. Secondly pleasantnes, whereby the passage is easie both with the streame and against it; whereas in riuers of a violent current, or in such as fall down by great locks or cataracts, the sailing or towing vp the water is as dangerous, as laborious. Thirdly, the thicknes of the water; for by how much the more slimie & grosse a water is, by so much can it carry the heauier burdens. So Tiber a riuer of more fame then depth, or bredth, is better for navigation by reason of its fatnes, then the pure and thinne waters of the large and excellent riuer Nilus, Fourthly, the broadnes of the channell, that ships & other vessels may conveniently winde & turne, & giue way to each other. Some of the old Philosophers reputed this conduct so dangerous, that one of them being asked, whether the liuing or the dead were the greater number, would not answere, because he knew not in which ranke to place such as were at Sea. And Cato Maior thought that men neuer committed greater folly in their liues, then in venturing to goe by water, when they might haue gone by land. I am none of that sect, yet I cannot but hold with him that said, dulcissima est ambulatio prope aquas navigatio iuxta terram.
               
               The chiefe riuers of Europe are Danubius and the Rhene; of Africa, Nilus and Niger; of Asia, Ganges and Euphrates; of America, Orenoque and Maragnon.

                  And she not being he was none.
               
I may justly say of these two Gemini, History and Geography.
            
               Before we come to the definition of History,
                  Pezelius,
                it is requisite we should distinguish it from such as at first blush doe challenge this name, and then to diuide it into its subordinate Species.
            The Treatises to whom this name is generally giuen, and from which History is indeed really distinct, are Commentaries, 2. Annals, 3. Diaries, and 4. Chronologies.
            
            
               1. Commentaries set down a naked continuance of the euents and actions, without the motiues & designes, the counsels, speeches, occasionsa, nd pretexts, with other passages: so that Caesar modestly rather then truly, applied the name of Commentary, to the best History in the world; though that Archcriticke Lipsius call them, nuda & simplex narratio. His reason is, Commentaria enim sunt, whereby you may perceiue the fe
                     •
                  low had read the title: & nihil pollicentur praeter nomen, by which it seemes, he looked no further. The worth of this History hath a more sacred Advocate,
                     Basilicon Doron.
                   euen our dread Soueraigne, who exhorting his Son to the study of Historie, aboue all prophane Writers commendeth him to his reading, both for the sweet flowing of the stile (I can vse no better words then his own▪) and the worthinesse of the matter it selfe. For I haue euer (saith he) bin of the opinion, that of all Ethnick Emperours, or great Captaines that euer were, he hath farthest excelled both in his practise, and in his precepts in martiall affaires.
               
               2. Annals are only a bare recitall of the occurrents hapning euery yeare, without regard had to the causes, and with a generall neglect of Historical ornaments: so that Tacitus named his worthy book much amisse.
               3. Diaries containe (as the name importeth) the particular actions of euery day, now not vsed but by Princes in their journeyes, and trauellers in their voyages.
               4. Chronologies are only bare supputations of the times, without any regard of the acts then happening, such are the Chronologies of Funccius, Scaliger, and Helvicus. Of which last man, the incredible paines he hath taken in, and the infinite proficiencie which he hath brought vnto this study: I cannot but giue that excellent testimony which Paterculus affordeth

                  Ouid, Perfectissimus est in forma operis sui.
               
            
            But History is as it were a quintessence extract out of those 4 Elements, borrowing from them all somwhat to beautifie her selfe withall; especially from Annals, time; from Commentaries, matter; and from Chronologies consent of times, & Coetanity of Princes Hauing thus gotten matter to worke on, and time in which she may effect her enterprises, she addeth of her own store, whatsoeuer ornaments are deficient in the rest, and maketh her selfe complete in euery particular.
            Hauing thus distinguished History from its Cognata, it remaineth we should diuide it into its subordinate Species.
            Histories are either of the

                  Greater World,
                  Lesser World, or of man that

                  The two eyes of the body of a well-compacted History, are place and time; the former belongeth to Geography, the latter is the terminus of all Epoches in computation. Now an Aera or Epoche is the terminus à quo, from which euery reckoning of times takes its beginning.

The Mahumetans begin their Hegira (for so they tearme their Computation) from the returne of their Prophet to Mecha, after he was driuen thence by the Philarcha, which hapned Ao Chr. 617. The Grecians reckoned by Olympiads, the first of which is placed in the yeare of the world, 3187. but this account perishing vnder the Constantinopolitan Emperours, they reckoned by Indictions, euery Indiction containing 15 yeares, and the first beginning Ao C. 313. which among Chronologers is still vsed. The Romans reckoned first from the building of their City, which was A.M. 3213. and afterward from the 16. yeare of the Emperour Augustus A.

                     Cicero beautifieth History with these attributes, Lux veritatis, testis temporis, vitae magistra, nuncia vetustatis, & vitae memoriae; concerning which particle, I find these verses prefixed to a Chronicle of our state, written by M. Martin;

            They which haue taken a delight in resembling every particular countrie to things more obvious to the sight and vnderstanding,

haue likened EVROPE to a Dragon, the head thereof (forsooth) being Spaine, the wings Italie & Denmarke. In like manner they haue beene curiously impertinent in resembling France to a Lozenge or Rhomboides: Belgia to a Lyon, Brittaine to an Axe: Ireland to an Egge: Peloponnesus to a Plantane leafe: Spaine to an Oxe hide spred on the ground: Italy (which indeed holdeth best proportion) to a mans leg, with diuers the like phantasmes of a capricious braine: these countries no more resembling them, then pictures made when painting was in her infancie, vnder which they were faine to write, this is a Lion, and this is a Whale; for feare the spectators might haue taken one for a Cocke, and the other for a Cat.

               EVROPE though the least (as being in length but 3800, in breadth but 1200 miles) is yet of most renowne: first because of the temperature of the ayre, & fertility of the foyle; secondly, from the study of all Arts, both ingenious and mechanicall: thirdly, because of the Romane and Greek Monarchies; fourthly, from the puritie and syncerenesse of the Christian faith: fiftly because we dwell in it, and so first place it.
            EVROPE is diuided into Continent and Ilands; the Continent is subdivided into 1. Spaine. 2. France. 3. Italy. 4. Belgia. 5. Germanie. 6. Denmarke 7. Norway. 8. Sweden. 9. Muscovia. 10. Poland. 11. Hungarie. 12. Dacia. 13. Sclavonia & 14. Greece. The Ilands are also in generall, either dispersed in the 1. Aegean Sea. 2. the Ionian Sea. 3. the Adriatique. 4. the Mediterranean. 5. the Brittish. and 6. the Northerne Seas, of all which in the order and method, here and before proposed.
            EVROPE is so called from Europa, daughter to Agenor, King of the Phoenicians, brought hither (as the Poets faine) by Iupiter in the shape of a Bull: but as Histories write, by a Cretan Captaine named Taurus, or in a shippe whose beake had wrought in it the figure of that beast.

            I had almost forgot the Etymologie of EVROPE according to Becanus, who thinking it vnmeet that Europe being first inhabited by the Gomerites or Cymbrians, should haue a Greeke name; maketh it Europe quasi Verhopp by the transposition of the two first letters; Ver forsooth signifying (though I knowe not in what language) excellent, and Hopp a multitude of people: because Europe containeth (oh the wit of man!) a multitude of excellent people.

               The figure of it is by Strabo compared to an Oxehide spred on the ground, whose necke being the Istmus which tieth it vnto France, is not of such breadth, but that in a cleare day one may discouer the Sea on both sides.
               The Countrie hath beene in diuers ages diuersly named, as 1. Hesperia either from Hesperus a supposed King hereof, or

from Hesperus the euening Starre, vnder which it was supposed to be situate, as being the farthest Countrie Westward. 2. Iberia either from the famous riuer Iberus, or from the Iberi, inhabiting the Countrie in Asia, which we call Georgia. 3.

For indeed their gate is (Gennet-wise) very stately and maiesticall. But not to conceale their vertues and make our selues merry only at their follies, wherein all other nations beare more or lesse a share with them; they are questionlesse a people very graue in their carriages, and in offices of pietie very devout, to their King very obedient, and of their ciuill duties to their betters not vnmindfull. But that which in them deserueth the greatest commendations, is an vnmoued patience in suffering aduersities, accompanied with a setled resolution to ouercome them: a noble vertue, of which in their Indian discoueries they shewed excellent proofes: and receaued for it a glorious and a golden reward.
               It is said, that the French are wiser then they seeme, and the Spaniards seeme wiser then they are; wherein they agree with many particular men of other nations, who carry the basest spirits vnder the prowdest lookes, and little found schollership vnder the most promising visages: and according to the Philosopher, Sapientes potius cupiunt videri & non esse,

                  The language hath much affinity with the Latine. Brerewood in his Enquiries teporteth that he hath seen a letter, euery word whereof was both good Latine and good Spanish. Merula shewes a Copy of the like, pag. 300. By reason of this consonancy with the Latine, the Spaniards call their language Romance. The other ingredients of this tongue are generally the Gotish, Arabique, and old Spanish; and in some places the French also: these people hauing made great conquests, & hauing had great negotiations in this countrie. It is said to bee a very loftie swelling speech, full of complement and courteship.

                  The Country heretofore was very abundant in Mines, insomuch that it was neuer free from Rouers of al nations. And it is affirmed that Annibal out of one only Mine in the Country of the Turdetani (now part of Andaluzia) receaued 3000l daily. It is enriched also with Sackes, Sugars, Oyle, Mettals, Liquoras, Rice, Silke, Lamb-skinnes, Wooll, Corke, Rosen, Steele, Orenges, Raisons, and fruit of the like nature, which owe most of their being to heat.

Quintilian the Oratour, Lucian, and Martial, excellent in their kindes, and Pemponius Mela the Geographer. In the middle times Fulgentius, and Isidore Bishop of Sevill. And in our Fathers dayes Arias Montanus,

               The Christian Religion was first here planted (as they say) by St 
                  Iames Anno 37. They were all constant to the Bishop of Rome, insomuch that in the sixt Councell of Tolledo, it was enacted that the King should suffer none to liue in his Dominions that professe not the Roman Catholike Religion; of which their King is so great a Patron, that a late Pope being sicke, and hearing divers moane his approaching end; vttered words to this effect, My life can nothing profit the Church, but pray for the king of Spaine as its chiefe supporter.

                   For indeed the Kings of Spaine, hauing framed to themselues an hope of the Westerne Monarchie;

& finding no fitter means of enlarging their own tēporal, then by cōcurring with the Pope in vpholding his spiritual Empire: haue linked thēselues most fast to that See. To this end they haue takē vpō thē to be the executioners of his excōmunicatiōs, by which office Ferdinand the Catholike surprised Navarre; hoping in time to worke so vpon the rest of the interdicted states of Europe: which Monarchie of the Spaniard is by the Iesuites (who in all their perswasions couple, as one God, and one Pope, so one King) taught to be the only meanes to vnite the differences of the Church, and subdue that great enemy of religion the Turke. And though by this office the kingdome of Spaine and Popedome of Rome, be thus straightly combined; yet herein the Popes haue ouershot themselues, in that leaning so much to the Spaniard, and so immoderately increasing his dominion; they doe in a manner stand at his deuotion, and may peraduenture in the end bee forced to cast themselues into his armes as their good Lord and master. For certaine it is that the Spanish Agents haue openly braued the Cardinals, and told them that they hoped to see the day, wherein their King should offer to the Pope halfe a dozen to be made Cardinals, and hee not dare to refuse any: and that they themselues should choose no Pope but one of their masters naming. So great an inconuenience it is more then possible it may bee to the Popes, in making this Prince the one and only string to their bowe.

                  The chiefe Riuers are 1. Tagus, celebrated for his golden sands, the head of it is in the mountaine Seira Molina neere to Cuenca, from the which it runneth by the citty Tolledo, & then smoothly gliding by the walls of Lisbon, doth pay his tribute to the Westerne Ocean. 2. Ana (now Guadiana) which rising about the same place, runneth afterward vnder the ground the space of 15 miles, and hence the Spaniards bragge, that they haue a bridge whereon 10000 cattle dayly feed. This is an accident common to many rivers, as to Mole a small riuer in Surrey, Erasinus in Greece, and Lycus in Anatolia, of which last thus Ovid.

Hispanus whence they conceit the name of Hispania to be deriued. 3. Tagus. 4. Baetus, and 5. Anus, whence the three famous Riuers in Spaine so called, must by all meanes be deriued. 6.

                   Of these 3 parts, Boetica was in most esteeme vnder the Romans, insomuch that in this Prouince there were reckoned to be 8 Romane Colonies; 8 municipall Citties, and 29 other Townes, endued with the rights and priuiledges of the Latines. The reason hereof was, that the people of this Country hauing beene formerly broken by the Carthaginians, with more quiet endured the yoke of the Romans; whereas the rest for a long time resisted the entrie & Empire of that prevailing Citty.

At first the Romanes fought not with the Spaniards, but the Carthaginians in Spaine; then perished both the Scipio's, viz▪ the father and

the vnkle of Africanus. Viriathus held warre for 20 yeares: Numantia resisted 15 yeares, the Astures remained vnconquered; and also stiffely maintained their particular liberties, that dijundicari non poterat (saith Velleius) Hispanisne Romanis plus esset in armis roboris, & vter populus alteri pariturus foret. Such were the ancient Spaniards. This Country continued a Romane Province till about the yeare 400, when it was subdued by Gundericus and his Vandals: of which people, their beginnings, atchieuments, and period, we will dilate when wee come into Africa, where the glory of them was most eminent, and where they ended like a Candle in a stinke. These Vandals were not warme in their new conquests, whē the Gothes (of whom more in Sweden) seazed on this country; confining the Vandals within Baetica, which afterward they left, partly to eschew the neighbourhood of a potent enemy, and partly on better hopes in Africke.

This people were Christians; though infected with Arrianisme, which ended in the dayes of Leonigild, anno 586. Their Kings were chosen by election, and an excommunication laid on such by the fift councell of Tolledo, as withstood the choice of the people. Their lawes most in vse were customary, written Statutes being first made by King Henry, which the ensuing Princes perfected and established.

                      erected their kingdome. It is recorded that at the first comming of Tariff into Spaine, a poore woman of the country being willingly taken prisoner, fell downe at his feet, kissed them, and told him that she had oft heard her father (who was lettered) say, that Spaine should bee conquered by 2 people, whose Generall should haue a mole on his right shoulder, and in whom one of his hands should be longer then the other. Hee to animate his Souldiers against the next encounter, vncloathed himselfe and shewed the marke, which so encouraged them, that they now doubted not the victory. Rodericke had in his army 130000 foot, and 25000 horse: Tariff had 30000 horse, and 180000 foot. The battaile continued 7 days together from morning to night: at last the Moores were victorious. What became of king Rodericke was neuer knowne; his Souldiers tooke one arrayed in their kings apparel, whom vpon examination they found to be a Sheepheard; with whom the king after the discomfiture had changed cloaths.

                     That kingdomes are to be kept by the same meanes they are got, is an axiom among Politicians: but that they are lost by the same, would seeme harsh vnto them; yet so it hapned to the Moores. The lust of Rodericke, a Spanish king, brought them thither; and the lust of Magnutza, a Moorish Viceroy, gaue the first checke to their fortune, which proued at last the ouerthrow of that kingdome: for Magnutza hauing employed Pelagius, a young Prince of the Asturia's, on an Embassie to Musa, the Captaine Generall of the Moores, then resident at Corduba; in his absence rauished his sister, and at his returne died by the edge of his sword: in applause of which noble act, & hope of greater exploits, Pelagius was by the people made King of Oviedo.

During the life of his father hee had reduced many townes to the obedience of the Church; but af

                     er his death hee was by Pope Iulio the 2, confined. From Rome he stole to Gonsalvo, Viceroy in Naples, for Ferdinand the Catholique; who, notwithstanding his safe conduct giuen, sent him prisoner to Spaine: from hence he escaped desperatly, (sliding down a window) into Navarre, where he was (as we haue said) slaine by an ambush. So many times was Machiavels great Politician ouer-reached by bookemen and souldiers. 3. Sanguessa, whose Inhabitants and neighbours in the beginning of this Pyrenean kingdome, paid a tribute of kine yeerely.

                  It took the name of Navarre, either from a town amongst the mountaines, called Navarrin, a place most likely, by reason of its strong situation, to resist the fury of the Moores, and to support the title of a new Potentate: or 2 from Navois, signifying a champion Country. It was also called the kingdome of Sobabre,
                     
                        Hist. of Sp.
                      for that the Pyrenei are in this place so called. The first king was Garcia Ximenes, who with 600 men only, began to oppose the Saracens, and left both title and possession vnto his successours. The sixt from this Garcia, was Inigo surnamed Arista, who began the ceremony of crowning and anointing in this Continent, according to the Spanish History. But the old Romane Prouinciall, cited by Mr 
                     Selden in his Titles of Honour, acknowledgeth no such honour due hereto: ascribing it only to the Emperours of the East and West, the Kings of Hierusalem, England, France, and Sicily. The 13th King was Sancho, for his valour and potencie surnamed the great; He was the first that euer did write himself King of Spaine, his predecessours calling

themselues kings of Navarre, his cōtemporaries kings of Leon only, the Gothes Kings of the Gothes in Spaine, and so the Vandals and Suevi. The reason was, because being a Prince of great power-ablenesse, he had also almost all Spaine, which belonged not to the Moores, in his possession. The Earledome of Arragon was vnited to this Navarre, Ao 867, when Garcia king hereof was married to Vrraca heire of Arragon▪ Castile he held in the right of his wife Donna Nugna, sister and heire to Earle Sancho: & as for Leon, he forcibly detained a great part of it vnder his Empire. Had all those Estates continued vnited vnder one head, questionlesse the Kingdome of the Moores had not so long subsisted; but this Sancho louing all his sonnes alike, gaue them alike portions and honours, bequeathing to his eldest son Garcia, Navarre; and that part of Leon which he conquered: to his second son Fernando, Castile: to his base son Raymir, Arragon, both which he had erected into Kingdomes. By meanes of this vnpolitick course, his sonnes being of equall powers & honours, insteed of opposing the common foe, bandied against each other; which, had all these principalities remained joyned, or the latter not dignified with the title of Kingdomes, had bin avoyded. The 30th King was Charles the 2d, whom I mention not for any glorious actions atchieued in his life, for that was full enough of ignominie; but for the strangenes and hideousnes of his death. He was a king much giuen to voluptuousnes and sensuall pleasures, which so wasted his spirits, that in his old age he fell into a kind of a Lethargie. To comfort his benummed joynts, he was bound and sowed vp naked in a sheet steeped in boyling Aquavitae: The Chirurgion hauing made an end of sowing him, and wanting a knife to cut off the threed, tooke a waxe candle that stood lighted by him; but the flame running down by the threed, caught hold on the sheet, which (according to the nature of Aquavitae) burned with that vehemencie, that the miserable King ended his dayes in the fire. The 38th Princes were Katharine Queene of Navarre, and Iohn Earle of Albret in Gascoigne, her husbād; in whose reigne Navarre was surprized by Fernando the Catholique, as anon I wil more particularly tell you. In the mean time let vs summe vp the Kings of this hillie Realme.

The honour of the day fell vnto Caesar, who then made an end of the ciuill warres, which that very day foure yeares before, were begun by Pompey the Father. In this battaile Cneius Pompeius was slaine, and his strength broken; Neither did Caesar escape without great losse, he neuer being before so put to his last trumpe: for seeing his souldiers giue back, he resolutely maintained the fight, bidding them remember they had at Munda forsaken their Generall. Shame, & his noble example, encouraged the souldiers to a new onset, which was honoured with the tropheyes of victory. This was the last field that Caesar euer was in, he being not long after, murdered in the Senate-house. In other places he vsed to say, he fought for honour; in this for his life. 2.

In the tenth yeere of this mans reigne, about the yeere 1492. the Empire of the Moores ended in Spaine, by the valour of Ferdinand the Catholique, and Isabel his wife, after their first entrance into it more then 760 yeeres. Such as after the decay of their kingdome stayed in Spaine, were by a statute in that case prouided, to be Christened; and that they might be known to bee as they professed, the Inquisition was ordained, consisting of a certaine number of Dominican Friers; who finding such counterfeiting Christians, were first gently to reproue and exh

This custome in it selfe was wondrous tollerable & laudable; but from the Moores it is turned on the Protestants, and that with such violence and extremity of torture, that it is counted the greatest tyranny and seuerest kind of persecution vnder heauen: Insomuch that many Papists who would willingly die for their Religion, abhorre the very name and mention, and to the death withstand the bringing in of this slauerie among them. This is it that made the people of Arragon and Naples rebell, countries where the people are all of the Papall side: and this was it which caused the irremediable revolt of the Low-countries; the greatest part of that nati

This racking of mens consciences is committed to the most zealous, fierie and rigorous Friers in the whole packe. The least suspition of heresie, affinity, or commerce with Heretikes, reprouing the liues of the Clergie, keeping any bookes, or editions of bookes prohibited; or discoursing in matters of Religion, are offences sufficient. Nay they will charge mens consciences vnder paine of damnation, to detect their nearest & dearest friends, if they doe but suspect them to be herein culpable. Their proceedings are with great secrecie & seuerity: for 1. the parties accused, shall neuer know their accuser, but sh

And as for torments and kindes of death, Phalaris and his fellow-tyrants, come farre short of these bloud-hounds. Each of those Inquisitors is honoured with the title of Lord, and are a great terrour to the neighbouring Peazants. There goeth a tale, how one of their Lordships desiring to eate of the peares which grew in a poore mans Orchard not farre off, sent for him to come vnto him: which put the poore Swaine into such a fright, that he fell sick, and kept his bed. Being afterward informed that his peares were the cause of his Lordships message, he plucked vp the tree by the roots, carrying it with all the fruit on it vnto him: and when he was demanded the reason of that vnhusbandly action; he protested that hee would neuer keepe that thing in his house which should giue any of their Lordships a further occasion to send for him.

                     Gallicia hath on the East the Asturia's, on the West & North the Sea, on the South the riuer Minius. The former Inhabitants were of Gallaici, whence the name is deriued. The Country is

like that of the Asturias, mountainous, and almost inaccessible; and so the fitter to hold out against forreine invasions, and to defend the person of its own Princes, and the common liberty.
                  The chiefe Cities are 1 Compostella, vulgarly called St 
                     Iago, in the honour of Saint Iames, who lieth here buried, and of whom there is an order of Knights.

The third king Reccaire did receiue the Christian Faith, & with it also Arrianisme: hee surprized Navarre and Arragon; but could not defend his owne countrie from Theodoricke the Gothe; who after gaue the Gallicians leaue to choose a new King. Hereupon ensued diuers bloudie factions betwixt the more potent of the Nobility, till at last the honour fell on Arismund. Finally after this kingdome had endured 177 yeares, it was subdued by Leonigild a king of the Gothes. It was againe made a kingdome by Alphonso the great of Leon, and by him giuen to his sonne Ordogno, Ao 886. and was again incorporated to Leon by Alphonso the sixt, who wrested it from Don Garcia,

                  The people of this Prouince vse a language different from the rest of Spaine, and is reported to haue continued without great alteration, since the confusion at Babel.
                     
                        Brerewood.
                      That it is of this age, I will not stand to proue; though an argument hereof may be, the small or no affinity it hath with other tongues, Yet that it was the ancient language of Spaine, is more then probable, because this people haue euer continued without any mixture of forreine Nations; as being neuer throughly subdued either by Romanes, Carthaginians, Gothes, or Moores; and so they remained, as in their liberties not mastered; so in their language not altered In like manner the Arabique continueth vncorrupt in the hillie parts of Granada; the tongue of the old Brittaines in our Wales, and the ancient Epirotique, in the high and woodie parts of that countrie. Neither doe these Biscaines differ from the rest of Spaine in language, but in customes also, three of which I will set down as a light to the rest. First they account themselues free from taxes, and contributions to the kings of Spaine, yeelding them obedience with their bodies, but not with their purses. And when any of the Spanish kings in their progresses come to the Frontiers of this Countrie, hee bareth one of his legs, and in that manner entreth into it. There he is met by the Lords and Gentlemen there dwelling, who proffe

                  The ancient inhabitants were the Cantabri, a people of that courage, that they defended the liberty of their Country against the Romans, when the residue of Spaine was subdued; and were at last not without great effusion of blood, and manifest tokens of manly resolution, and Heroick spirits, on their parts; vanquished by the darling of Fortune, Augustus. Such hillie & mountainous people are alwayes the last that are conquered, and the first that stand on their own guard, as besides these Biscanies, the Navarroys and Asturians here in Spaine, in respect of the Moores: and our Brittaines in relation to the Saxons. Whether it be, that liuing in a sharpe aire, and being inured to labour, they proue on occasion, good and able men: or that the Forts of Natures own building, are not so easily wonne, as defended: or that the vnpleasantnesse of the Country, & vhfruitfulnesse of the soile, yeeld no occasion to strangers to desire & adventure for it, I cannot determine.
                        Hist. of Sp.
                      These Biscanies were the last also that submitted to the fury of the Moores, whom shortly after they droue thence by the valour of Soria a Noble Scot 870; whose posterity enjoyed this proprietary Lordship, till that Nero of Spaine, Don Pedro, violently tooke it from the true Heire, Donna Iane, and her Husband, 1358.

It is seated in the very center almost of Spaine, and is passing well inhabited, as well by Noblemen who reside there for pleasure; by merchants who resort thither for commodity; and by men of warre who are garrison'd there for the defence of it. This city was taken by the Moores at their first entrance into Spaine,

                  Next it was the feare of the Moorish Princes; and now of the Archbishops, who are the chiefe Prelats of Spaine, and Presidents for the most of the Inquisition. Their revenewes are certainly the greatest of any spirituall Prince, except the Popes, as mounting to the yearely value of 300000 Crownes. This City is honored with an Vniversity, famous for the study of the Ciuill and Common Lawes; as also with 18 Nationall Councels here held vnder the Gothish kings. The next City of any note is Calatrava, on the riuer Ana, famous for its order of Knights. It standeth on, or neere vnto the place where in former times stood the strong and famous city Castulo;

                      which being vnder the command of the Romanes, was by the Gyresoeni, a people that dwelt on the other side of the riuer, suddainly entred and taken. But Sertorius entring after them at the same gate, put thē to the sword; and causing his men to apparell themselues in the cloathes of their slaine enemies, he led them to the chiefe Cities of the Gyresoeni; where the people supposing them to be their companions, opened their gates, and were all either slain or sold

for slaues. The third towne of note is Talbora, vulgarly called Talveira di Roina, a very neat and sweet towne, seated on the Tagus.

It is now famous for the Hauen which it hath, very capacious, & of that safety, that that worthy Sea Captaine Andreas Doria, Admirall vnto Charles the fift, vsed to say, that there were but three safe ports in the Mediterranean, which were Cartagena, August & Iuly: meaning, as I conceaue, that those two months being commonly free from winds and tempests, were no lesse secure to marriners then the port of Cartagena. See, I beseech you, the priuiledge of autority and antiquity; for had a meaner man spoke this in those times, or a greater man in these wherein we liue: neither the one nor the other would haue bin remembred for it. But one inch of greatnesse, and another of age, hath I perceaue, the prerogatiue to put such saplesse & vnworthy conceits vpon the Register, which in our daies would either not be obserued, or else scorned.

                  8. CASTILE.
                  CASTILE is bounded on the East with Navar, Arragon, and the Country of Tolledo; on the West with Portugal; on the North with the Asturias; on the South with Andaluzia and Granada. This was the most preuailing kingdome to which the rest were all vnited, either by conquest, or inter-marriages. It is now diuided into the New and the Old.
                  
                  The Old Castile is situate on the North of the New. The chief Citties are, 1 Soriae or Numantia, in which 4000 Souldiers withstood 40000 Romans, for fourteene yeares. During which time hauing valiantly repulsed,

It was reckoned one of the 7 ancient Vniuersities of Spaine, but afterwards falling to decay, it was restored by king Philip the 2d, whose birth place it was; & who erected here a College among others for the education of young English fugitiues, 4 Avila, called formerly Abule, of which Tostatus was Bishop, and is therefore called Abulensis. Hee was, as the Epistle to his workes informeth me, President of the Councell to Iohn the 2d, King of Arragon; and will bee eternally famous for his learned and paineful Commentaries on the Bible: for so great they are, that it is supposed (if we had all his workes) that he wrote as many sheets as he liued daies; and for the worth of them take along with you this eulogie which Casaubon in his worke against Baronius, affordeth him, Lando acumen viri si in meliora incidisset tempora longe maximi. 5 Burgos built, or rather repaired by Nugno Belides a German; this Towne contendeth with Tolledo for the Primacy of Spaine.

                  The old inhabitants of these Castiles, were the Vaccai, Ventones,

Carpentani, Oretani, Bastitani, Dittani, &c. From none of which the name of Castile can bee deduced; so that wee must fetch it either from the Castellani, once the inhabitants of Catelogne, or from some strong fortified Castle in these parts. This last coniecture may seeme probable, because the Armes of this kingdome are Guies, a Castle triple-towred Or: Neither is it any way strange for Prouinces, especially smaller ones (for such at the first this was, though now much extēded both in bounds and power) to take their names from a Castle. For (to goe no farther) euen with vs, Richmondshire, was so called from the castle of Richmond, there built by Alaine Earle of Brittaine: and Flintshire tooke denomination from a Castle built of flintstones by Henry the 2d. We may see hereby how much Celius Secundus Curio was deceaued, who writeth that Alphonso the third hauing ouerthrowne Mahomet Enasir the King of Morocco & Granada, & put 60000 of his men to the sword: assumed these Armes, that thus named this kingdome, which was before called the kingdome of the Bastitanes; because that victory like a strong castle (forsooth) confirmed his kingdome vnto him. And for the former Etimologie it appeareth most euidently, in that the people are by the Latines called Castellani, the Countrey Castella.

This mony by the negligence of the Kings Officers, grew so great a sum; that to satisfie Gonsales, the King made him the Proprietary Earle of Castile 939. The heire to the fift Proprietary Earle, was Donna Nugna married to Sancho the great of Navarre, 1208: by whom this Earledome was made a Kingdome, and giuen to Ferdinand his sonne, 1034.

So that the whole time of his sitting in the Chaire of Estate was 72 yeares; a longer enioying of soueraignty then euer any Prince since the beginning of the Roman Monarchie attained to.

For he twice ouercame this great Pompey, the first time dangerously wounding him, the second time driuing him out of the field. But when Pompey and Metellus ioyned, he was ouer-matched, and yet seemed to retire out of the field rather then to flie. Certainly the Spaniards behaued themselues very valiantly

                  The chiefe Cities are 1 Girone, the title of the Arragonian Prince, seated on the riuer, Baetulus. 2 Barcelone on the Sea, a town of good strength & antiquity, as rising out of the ruines of Rubicata, an old Colony of the Africans, before the comming of the Romanes into Spaine. It hath belonging vnto it an indifferent faire Hauen, and is the seat of the Vicegerent. 3 Perpigna (called in Iohnsons Map of Spaine, Perpinha) in the County of Rossillon. This town & the Country was pawned by Iohn king of Arragon 1462. to Lewis the 11th of France, for 300000 Crownes: & restored to Fernand the Catholique by Charles the 8th 1493, that he might uot be hindred in his journy to Naples. Francis the first, king of France, partly to requite the Emperour Charles the 5. for the warre he made in Provence; and partly to get into his hands a town, which is as it were one of the doores of Spaine: sent his son Henry (afterwards King) with a puissant

army to force it, Ao 1542. But the town was so well fortified, so brauely manned, & so abundantly stored with munition, that this journey proued as fruitlesse and dishonorable to the French king: as the invasion of Province, and siege of Marseiles, had bin before to the Emperour.

The present name is taken from Tarragon, a city which once gaue denomination to the greatest part of Spaine, and is situate on the borders of this Country, where it is confined with Catelogne. This town was built, fortified & peopled by the two Scipioes, the Father and Vncle of Africanus; to oppose and bridle Cartagena, not long before built by the Carthaginians.

And well may they thus doe, for at other times they sit rent-free as it were: only they acknowledge the king of Spaine to be the head of their Commonwealth. This revenue is proportionably 200000 Ctownes a yeare, all which if not more, the king again expends, in maintaining his Viceroyes in these seuerall Prouinces. 3 Iaca situate on the very Northerne edge of all the Country.

                      One of the kings was Aigoland, who long time made Charlemaigne belieue he would be baptized; and the time now at hand in which he should fulfill his promise, he very gallantly accompanied, came to the French Court: where seeing many Lazars and poore people expecting almes from the Emperours table, he asking what they were, was answered, that they were the Messengers & seruants of God: ou these words he speedily returned, desperatly protesting that he would not serue that God, which could keep his seruants no better. This town was recouered from the Moores by Alphonso of Navarre 1118. 7 Bilbilis (now Calataiub) the birth-place of Martial

                  THE MONARCHIE OF SPAINE.
                  Before the reigne of the last Ferdinand of Arragon, Spaine being diuided amongst many Potentates, was little famous, lesse regarded: the kings, as the Author of the politique dispute, &c. well noteth, being only kings of Figges and Orenges. Their

whole puissance was turned one against the other, and final atchieuements had they out of the Continent, vnlesse those of the house of Arragon in Sicile, Sardinia, and the Baleares. Thuanus a diligent writer of the History of his own times (if in some respects he sauour not more of the party then the Historian) telleth vs, that till this kings reigne, the name and glory of the Spaniard's was like their Country; confined and hemm'd in by the Seas on one part, & the mountains on the other; potius

                  But this Prince, worthily named the Great, seized on the Kingdome of Navarre, ruined the kingdome of the Moores in Granaeda, began by the conduct of Columbus the discouery of the Westerne Indies, banished 124. families of the Iewes, surprised the kingdome of Naples, vnited Castile to Arragon, & lastly by marrying his daughter Ioane to Philip, sonne to Maximilian the Emperour, Duke of Burgundie, and Lord of Belgia, laid the foundation of the present Austrian greatnes.

Indeed to his Countrymen the French, the name & puissance of the Spaniard hath ministred no small matter of feare and terrour; yet are there some others, who being weighed in the scales of war with them, would find them to be but light coyne, at least if they knew their own waight. Yet without doubt this Realme is euen to wonder strengthned and enlarged; strongly vnited and compacted with all the ligaments of power & state in it selfe; and infinitly extended ouer the most principall parts of not Europe onely, but of the World also: his dominions beholding, as it were, both rising and setting of the Sunne in his East and Westerne Indies, which before the Spaniard, no Monarch could euer say. A great change, which 140 yeares since, no man would

haue belieued to haue bin possible to be effected.

On this and other cousiderations the Author of the generall History of Spaine reckoneth his reuenewes according to diuers opinions, to 14, 18, and 23, Millions of Crownes. To make vp the summe, he addeth the first fruits, and some part of the Tithes, amounting vnto three millions; and the Author of the Politique dispute about the happiest, &c. affirmeth

For the kingdome of Naples giueth him euery third yeare a million & 20000 crownes; and (to omit others) Castile did of late grant him a contributiō of foure millions to be paid in 4 yeares. Yet is not this Prince very rich, his expences being very great, first in keeping Garrisons in the heart of all his Countries, against the reuolt of the natiues: secondly in maintaining the fortresses on the frontires, against forraigne inuasions: thirdly in continuall pay of an Armada, for the conducting of his gold from America: & fourthly the vnprofitable warres of Philip the second haue plunged the Crowne so in the gulfes of Bankers and mony men, that much of the Kings lands is ingaged for their repaiment.

                  nstrument of it being Minier the President of the Councell of Aixe. For having condemned this poore people of heresie, he mustred a smal Army and set fire on the Villages. They of Merindoll, seeing the slame, with their wiues and children fled into the woods, but were there butchered, or sent to the gallies. One boy they took, placed him against a tree, & shot him with Caliuers: 25 which had hid themselues in a Caue, were in part stifled, in part burned. In Cabriers they so inhumanely dealt with the yong wiues and maids, that most of them died immediatly after: The men and women they put to the sword; the children they rebaptized: 800 men were murdered in a Caue, and 40 women put together in an old Barne and burned. Yea such was the crueltie of the Souldiers to these poore women, that when some of them has clambred to the top of the house, with an intent to leape downe, the Souldiers beat them backe againe with their pikes. The Massacre of Paris was more cunningly plotted. A peace was made with the Protestants, for the assurance whereof a marriage was solemnized betweene Henry of Navar, cheefe of the Protestants partie; and the Lady Margaret the Kings sister.

At this wedding there assembled the Prince of Conde, the Admirall Colligni. & divers others of great note. But at this solemnity there was not so much wine dranke, as bloud shed. At mid-night the watch-bell rang, the King of Nauarre, and the Prince of Conde were taken prisoners; the Admirall most villanously slaine in his bed; and to the number of thirty thousand and vpward, of the best, and most potent of the Religion, sent through this red sea, to the land of Canaan.

                  The lawes of this Kingdome are either temporall: or fundamentall, which no King or Parliament can alter. Of the latter

of these the chiefe are two, the Salique, and the law of Apennages. This of Apenuages is a law whereby the younger Sonnes of the King cannot haue partage with the elder. This law was made by Charlemagne, before whose time France was diuidable into as many Kingdomes, as the King had sonnes. By this law the younger (though sometimes they are content with ye

This law they pretend to haue beene made by Pharamond their fast King, and that the words, Si Aliqua, so often mentioned, gaue it the name of the Salique law: Hailan, one of their best writers, saith it was neuer heard of in France till the dayes of Philip the faire 1321. Others say it was framed by Charles the great after his conquests in Germany, where the incontinent liues of the women liuing about the riuer Sala (in the Country now called Misnia) gaue both the occasion & name to this law, the words are these,

This interpretation admitted, the sense of the law must be, that in lands holden of the King by Knights fee, or the like military tenure, only the males should inherit, because the women could not performe those seruices by which the lands were holden. In England we deale not with women so vnkindly, but permit them to enioy such lands after their age of 15

yeares, because then they may take such husbands as are able to doe the King the duties and seruices required. But this interpretation, how good & genuin soeuer indeed it be, cannot stand with the French Glosse: For then the Crowne being holden of none but God only, & so not properly called a fee or feife, were vncapable of that priuiledge of exclud

For wee read in Numbers cap. 27. that the daughters of Zelopedah were adiudged to possesse the inheritance of their father. All Kingdomes else admit women to the Regency; yea euen France it selfe most seruilely hath submitted it selfe twice, to the imperious command of two women of the Medices. But suppose this law to be made by Pharamond, to concerne France, to bee consonant with the lawes of other nations, and the word of God; doth it therefore appertaine to all France? Nothing lesse. Pharamond had then not so much as the Il

               Againe, we see the French for their own particular good, not a whit to haue regarded it, King Pipin hauing put his Master Childericke into a Monastery, to patch vp his broken title to the Crowne, drewe his pedegree from some of the daughters, of the issue of the former Princes. As also Hugh Capet putting aside Charles of Lorraine, the right heire of the stocke of this Pepin; to make his bad attempts more seemingly honest, drewe his title by the Daughters of the issue of Charles the great. And Lewis the ninth, so renowned for his sanctity, neuer inioyed the crown with a quiet conscience, till it was proued vnto him, that by the Grandmothers side, hee was descended from the heires of the fore-mentioned Charles of Lorraine.

I aske then this question; did this law extend to one only part of France (namely the Isle wherein Pharamonds posterity first reigned) or to euery part? If to all ioyntly; with what right could Charles the 8th possesse himselfe of Brittaine, in right of his wife, who no question was a woman: when there were some of the male line of that Ducall family surviuing? If it belong to that part only; with what colour can they dawbe their forcible withholding of it from the true heire of Anne the Dutches; whose daughter and heire Claude, had issue by Francis the 1 her husband, Henry the second, her sonne and heire: whose eldest Daughter and Heire (after the death of her foure brothers, Francis the second, Charles the 9th, Henry the 3d, and Francis Duke of Aniou, all dying without issue) was Elizabeth, married to Philip the 2d of Spaine.

The Gothes possessed all the country betweene the Rhoane, East; the Aquitaine Ocean, West; the Loyre, North; and the Pyrenean hills, South. The Burgundians had all which lieth betweene the Alpos & the Rhene, East; the Rhoane West; Lorreine, North; and the Mediterranean, South. All the rest together with Belgia belonged to Franks, whose King Charlemaine vtterly ruined the kingdome of the Gothes: & his successours by little and little haue brought to almost nothing, that of the Burgundians. By the Romans this country was diuided into three parts, viz: Belgicam, environed with the Rhene, the Marne, the Seine, and the Ocean: 3ly, Aquitanicam, which reached from the Pyrenean hills to the Garound; and contained also all the sea coasts vp to the Loyre: 3ly, Celticam, which comprehended all the rest; and was subdiuided into Lugdunensem, containing Daulphine, Savoy, and both Burgundies; and Nar

So did our William the Conquerour; who at his arriual into England, burnt the shippes which transported his Army, thereby giuing his Souldiers to wit, that their liues lay in the strength of their armes, & courage of their hearts; not in the nimblenesse of their heeles. Tariff the leader of the Moores into Spaine, burnt likewise all his Navy, one only Pinnace excepted, which he reserued to carry tidings of his successe. When Charles Martell encountred that infinite hoste of the Saracens, (of which you shall anon heare more) hee commanded the people of Toures to open their gates onely to the Victors: then he led his Army ouer the Loyre, placing on the bankes thereof certaine troupes of horsemen, to kill all such as fled out of the field: Hereby informing his men, that there was to them no more France then what they fought on, vnlesse they were conquerours.

The King of France inuadeth Britaine, The Duke ouercharged with melancholy, dies, 1488; leauing Anne his daughter and heire, in the power of his enemy Charles the eight: who contracts a marriage with the Orphan, and vniteth Brittaine to France. There were many impediments which might haue hindred this marriage, but Charles breaketh through them all. First Charles himselfe had bin formerly contracted to Archduke Maximilians daughter; but this he held voide, because the yong Lady was not of age at the time of the contract. 2ly 
                     Anne the Dutches was also contracted to Maximilian; and this he held vnvalid, because the Dutchesse being his homager, could not bestow her selfe without his licence. & 3l• 
                     Maximilian had by proxie married her, which marriage he consummated by a ceremony in those daies new; For his Embassadour attended by a great traine of Lords and Ladies, bared his leg vp to the knee, and put it into the Dutchesses sheets, thereby taking possession of her bed and body: But Charles consulting with his Diuines, was told that this pretended consummation, was rather an invention of Court, then any way firme by the Lawes of the Church. Certainely God blessed not this wedding; for of three children which they had betweene them, not one liued. Charles being dead, his successor Lewis on the same policie, divorced himself from his own wife, & married this Dutchesse. From this second mariage, the Acrhdutchesse Isabell descended; for whom, when her Father King Philip made a claime to this Dutchy,

After this wicked act, his conscience accusing him, and the Roman Bishop exhorting to repentance, he erected the Lordship of Ividot to a kingdome; assigning the posterity of Gawter all the prerogatiues of a free Monarch, as to make Lawes, coine money, and the like. From hence the French call a man that hath but small demaines to maintaine a great title, a Roy d' Ividot. At last, but at what time I know not, it fell again to a Lordship, and belongeth now to the house of Bellay in Little Brittaine.

This town was in the first ciuill warres in France about religion, yeelded into the hands of Elizabeth of England by the Prince of Conde and his faction, as a towne of Caution, for such forces as she should on their behalfe leuie. The French king not liking a neighbour so potent, made peace with the Protestants, on that condition that they should driue home the English. By this meanes he weakned their forces for the present; depriued them of all hope of future aide from our Queene; twisted his own plots closer; and the next yeare began a stronger warre vpon them, now ashamed anywhere to demand succour.

These Francones were a people which liued in the great Forrest called Sylva Hercyma in Germany,

They were gouerned by Dukes till the yeare 420, when Pharamond took on him the title of king. As for France, the first that euer set foot there, was Moroucus, who seeing the Romans on one side put to the worst by Theodoric and the Gothes; entred together with the Burgundians on the other, seazed on the Isle of France, subdued Paris, & made it the seat of his Kingdome.

Afterward when they had fully seated thēselues here, the kings vsed to diuide their kingdome according to the number of their sons:

Francis the first, whom the French call the father of the Muses, intended, (being perswaded thereunto by Reucline and Budaus, as great restorers of letters in those parts, as Moore in England, or E. rasinus in Germanie) to haue built here a Colledge, wherein should haue bin Professours of all Arts and Languages. He would haue endowed it with 50000 Crownes of yearely revenue, for the maintainance of his Professours and Schollers, whose number in all should haue bin 600. But it went no further then the intent, for death took from him time to actuate it. This City is in compasse 12 miles, and is reported to haue bin built in the time of Amasias King of Iudah. It standeth in a most fertile soile, insomuch that when it was besieged by the Dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Brittaine, with an army of 100000 men; neither the assailants without, nor the defendants within, felt any want of victuals; and yet the Citizens besides the common souldiers, are reckoned to be 4 or 500000. It is honoured with a Parliament, to which all other may appeale, from which not one. These French Parliaments are as our Law-Courts are, our Parliaments as their Conventus ordinum. It is seated on Seine, which serueth the Town with little boates and barges (as the Thames Westward doth London) the riuer ebbing and flowing no farther then Pontclarch, distant from Paris 75 miles, or thereabout.

But Clotayre the 2d to ease himselfe and his successours of a burden so weighty; made the Mayres Vicars generall of his Empire. From henceforward the Kings followed the

Vnder Degobert the first, Pepin was Mayre; who continued in that office till the reigne of Clovis the third, and then he died, leauing his authority to Charles Martell his base son. This Charles did to the Kings of France great seruice, for which he was created Duke or Prince of the French. Yet would not he (though the Estate was at his disposure) settle it in himselfe; it being his vsuall saying, that he had rather rule a King, then be one. As for his son Pepin, he succeeding his Father in authority but not in vertuous resolutions, was by Pope Zachary the first invested with the Diademe of France; and the vnfortunate king Childericus, had his powle shauen, and was thrust into a Monastery. For this investiture, both Pepin and his son Charles the great, did good seruice to the Romane Prelates, and they to requite their kindnesses, gaue vnto the last, the Empire of the West; and the title of most Christian King. The sonnes of this most worthy Emperour, did most vnworthily degenerate.

In the yeare 1250, or thereabouts, they were by a long and bloudy warre waged against them by the Popes and French Kings; almost vtterly rooted out: when vnder the conduct of Raimond Earle of Tholouse, they had for 28 yeares made good their side by

Here they liued a godly and laborious life, painefully tilling the ground, restoring hamlets, which formerly had beene destroyed by warre; and teaching the very rocks in a manner to yeeld herbage for the nourishment of cattle: insomuch that places which at their comming thither scarce yeelded 4 crownes yearly; were by their good husbandry made worth 350 crownes a yeare vnto the Lord of them. Lasciuiousnesse in speech one with another they vsed not; blasphemy against the honour of God they abhorred; neither was the name of the diuell at any time in their mouths: and this their enimies were enforced to acknowledge and confesse when they were afterward in troubles. All the faults proued against them were, that when they came into any neighbouring Churches they prayed immediatly to God, without relation to any of the Saints: and when they came by Crosses erected in the high way, they bowed not before them. Thus liued this poore people, neither embracing the Popes doctrine, nor acknowledging his supremacie, the space of 300 yeares vntouched and vnquestioned; euen till the latter end of the raigne of Francis the first. But then persecutions raging against the Lutherans, they were accused, & inhumanely handled in the massacre of Merindol and Cabrieres abouementioned. Yet here vnto this day they liue and continue in the faith. If now the Papists aske mee where was our Church before the time of Luther; I answere that here it was; that here God was worshipped according to the manner by himselfe prescribed, and by the reformed Churches followed. Here I say were those few Israelites hidden, which had not bowed their knees vnto Baal.

These Colonies were instituted partly to represse rebellions in the conquered countries; partly to resist a forraine enimie; partly to reward the ancient Souldiers; partly to relieue the poorer sort; & partly to purge and empty the Citty of the superfluity and redundance of her people.

                      the word, Immensi tremor Oceani. It tooke the name from the picture of Saint Michael, conquering the diuel, which was annexd' to the Collar. Some thinke that the invention of Saint Michael, was in allusion vnto the 10th of Daniel: Others say he took Saint Michael in regard of an apparition of that Saint, to his Father Charles the 7 on Orleance bridge, in the warres against the English.
                  
                  5. Of the Holy Ghost, ordeined by Henry the third, Ao 1570. The Knights are sworne by solemne Oath, to persecute the Hugonots, and fauour the Romish Catholiques. Their Robe is a black veluet mantle, powdred with Lillies, & flames of gold & siluer; none are admitted to this order, who cannot proue their Nobility, by three descents at least. The Collar is of Flowers de lys, and flames of gold; with a Crosse, & a Doue on it, pendant. The reason of the institution was, because the order of Saint Michael began to grow too common among the vndeseruing; which order he took not away, but mingled with this; it being by him ordained, that the next day aster the Collar of the Holy Ghost is giuen; that of Saint Michael should bee added, if the honoured had it not before. It was called by the name of the Holy Ghost, because this Henry was on a Whitsunday chosen King of Poland.

length of it is ninety miles, the breadth sixty.
                  The people are much renowned for warlike affaires, marching vnder the colours of diuers Princes, vnder the name of Wallons. This name is giuen vnto this people by the Dutch, who vsing W for G, insteed of Gallons (or Galloys) cal them Wallons. Others report, that when the Burgundians came first into Gaul, they asked the people of the Country running to see them, On allons, that is, whither goe wee; and that thereupon they got the name of Wallons: a proper invention, and of the same pitch as that of the Hugonots.

                        Ortelius.
                     LORREINE is compassed about with part of Belgia, Alsatia, the County of Burgundy, and Champaigne: The former name of it was Austrasia, being then of a farre greater extent then now it is: it borrowed the name of Lotharingia, from Lotharius, Nephew to Charles the Great, by his sonne Lewis.
                  
                  The length of it; is about some foure dayes journey, the bredth almost three; and is sufficiently famous in that that famous warrier Godfrey surnamed of Bulloigne, which wonne Hierusalem from the Turkes, was Duke here.
                  This Countrey aboundeth with corne and wine, an excellent race of horses, plenty of mines, store of salt and fish.
                  
                     
                        Grimstons estates.
                     The people (as neighbours to both) participate of the French complement, and German drinking, but more moderatly then either: They are hardie and politick, as they which cannot otherwise maintaine their state, bordering vpon so many Princes. They liue in a very happy condition vnder their Duke, grow daylie more rich, and are not oppressed at all with taxes: which make them affectionate vnto him, and louing one towards another.
                  Here is in this Countrey good store of Lakes replenished with fish; but one there is of most note, being 14 miles in compasse, the fish whereof yeeldeth to the Duke 2000l yearely.
                  The riuers of chiefe note are 1 Martha, or the Meure; 2 Mosa, or Meuse,
                     
                        Grimston
                      and 3 Moselle: this last riuer is famous for the designe which Lucius Verus, gouernor here vnder Nero, had vpō it. For whereas it ariseth in the mountaine Vogese, not far from the head of the riuer Soane; and disburdeneth if selfe into the Rhene at confluence: he intended to haue cut a deep and large channell from the head of this riuer, to the head of the Soane, that so there might be a more quicke and easie passe from the Mediterranean into the Ocean; the Soane emptying it selfe into the Rhone; and the Moselle into the Rhene.
                  
                  The chiefe townes are 1 Nancie seated on the Meure, the

                  When the Germans chose themselues an Emperour, this Province was the cause of many troubles betweene them and the French; the former keeping possession, the latter pretending a title Charles sonne to Lewis the 4th king of France,
                     
                        Hist. of Fr.
                      being left to the curtesie of his brother, and by him not regarded; was invested in this Dutchy by Otho the Emperor, Anno 981. for which cause he shewed himselfe so alienated from the French, & wedded to the Germans; that the French after the death of his Cosin Lewis the 5, reiected him, and chose Hugh Capet for their King. This Charles had one sonne name Otho, (who leauing no issue male, instituted one Godfrey, from whom descended Godfrey of Bulloigne, his successour) and one daughter called

                     Hermingrade, from whom came Isabell, wife to Philip the second; vniting the bloods of Pepin, and Hugh Capet, to the great content of her grandchild St 
                     Lewis, who being a man of very tender conscience, is said neuer to haue joyed in the Crowne of France, till it was proued that by his mothers-side hee was the right Heire of Charles of Lorreine, whom Hugh Capet had so vniustly dispossessed. This principality continueth to this day without any great alteration of linage.
                  The Armes of Lorreine are Or, a Bend Gules, charged with three Larkes Argent. But herein I find Bara the old and expert Herauld, to differ from Paradine, the most exact Genealogist of the French Nation. For Bara saith that the Bend is charged not with three allouettes Larkes; as Paradine, but with three Allerions, or Allelyons, which are in blazon, small birds wanting beak, feet and legges. Of this last opinion is that most worthy Antiquary Camden Clarencieux, who withall telleth vs, that when Godfrey of Bulloigne was at the siege of Hierusalem, shooting at Saint Dauids towre there, he broched three feetlesse birds called Allerions vpon his arrow,

                  16. SAVOY.
                  The Dukedome of SAVOY is confined with Daulphine, Bresse, Switzerland, and Peidmont.
                  
                  This Countrey for the streight and narrow passages, & them too full of theeues, was once called Malvoy; till a worthy adventurer of the Countrey, with industry and exemplary iustice, reformed both the vilenesse of the people, and the passages: then was it called Savoy, or Salvoy, quasi Salva via.
                  
                  Within the limits of this Dukedome standeth the famous city of Geneva, being yet but two English miles in circuite, and hauing territories streaching no farther then two leagues and a

halfe on each side: The revenue therof is about 60000 crownes. The towne standeth at the end of the Lake Lemanus, and by Rhoane is diuided into two parts. The gouerment is by a common Councell, consisting of 200; the foure chiefe whereof are called Syndiques.
                  
                  Their Ministers cannot but be poore, hauing no tithes but stipends; the greatest whereof comes not to 80 pounds yearely: and after this rate also is it with the Clergie, in all the Churches of France and Germany, which follow the Discipline of Geneva: For the tithes are taken by the Ciuill Magistrate, and distributed partly among the poore, partly layde vp in the cō
                     mon treasury: But out of this there is againe some portion deducted, to bestow the daughters, and bring vp the sonnes of such of the Ministers, who die poore, or leaue their children vnprouided; the most commendable part in my conceit, of the whole Discipline.
                  The Church-gouernment consisteth of a Miscellany of Laymen and Ministers,
                        M. Hooker
                      which gouernment was begun by Mr 
                     Calvin, Anno 1541: and hath since without mature consideration bin headily receiued in most Churches of France & Belgia. The people had banished their Bishop 1535, and then seeing Calvin, and two of his Fellow-Ministers, vsurpe the prerogatiue, though not the title of Bishops, banished all three. Desiring to recall him againe, they were content to receiue a Discipline, if not ouer-prejudiciall to the City: Calvin framed this, consisting of two Laymen annually chosen for euery one Minister; which also with much grumbling was receiued by them.
                  This City was once diuided betwixt the Bishop and the Savoyen; till at last the Bishop got the entire possession, leauing the Duke the soueraignty and homage; in whose name, lawes were made, and mony was coyned. But the people hauing banished their Bishop, haue stood since on their owne liberty; and aided by England with 13000; by Venice with 24000 Crownes; and by Florence with intelligence, resisted the great siege of the D. of Savoy, Anno 1589. They allow all manner of honest recreations vpon Sundaies; Fornication they punish with nine dayes fasting; Adultery with death. They haue a law,

that if any Malefactour flie to them for refuge▪ they punish him after the custome of the place in which the crime was committed: otherwise,

Through these hills Annibal made a way, with fire & vineger, for the passage of his army into Italy: whence it was said of him, viam aut inveniet Annibal, aut faciet.

                  There are fiue passages ouer these hills into Italy, viz: three out of France, and two out of Germany; the first from France is through Provence, & so close vpō the Tyrrhenian seas, through

                  Liguria, which is the easiest, The second is through the hills called Gen
                        •
                     ura, into the Marquisate of Saluzzes, and so to Lombardic: this is the place through which the invincible Annibal trauelled with such difficulty; and through which also Charles the 8 marched toward Naples. The third is ouer Mount Conis, through the country of Turin, which was first hanselled (if we beleeue antiquity) by Hercules. From the passage of these captaines, were these latter hills called Alpes Graiae
                  ▪ and the former Alpes Penninae, or more truly Paeninae from the Paeni, or Carthaginians. The first way out of Germany into Italy, is through the Country of the Grisons, by the Town of Veltlyn; which the Spaniard hath seased into his hands: so that by the keeping of this Veltlyn, or Valtolin, and manning of the Fort Fuentes, which he also erected; he is in a manner the Lord of this passage, not only to the discontent of the Natiues, but to the distaste of his neighbours the Savoyards and Venetians. The other way out of Germany into Italy, is through the County of Tirolis, by the towns of Inspruch and Trent. This passage is commanded by the Castle and Fort of Eresberge, seated on the confines of this Country towards Suevia, & from Inspruch is two dayes journey distant. This Fort in the warre which the Protestant Princes made against Charles the 5, was surprized by Captain Schertelin, so to hinder the comming of the Popes Forces into Germany: for which the Emperour so hated him, that when all the rest of the faction were pardoned, he only continued a Proscript, his head being valued at 4000 Crownes. The taking also of this Fort, and the Castle adjoyning, to D. Maurice of Saxony
                  ▪ made the said Charles then being in Inspruch, fly out of Germany.

                  The language of Italy was diuers, in Apulia they vsed the Mesapian tongue: In Calabria the Greeke: In Etruria the Thuscan; and in Latium the Latine, which yet so altered in a little time, that Polybius saith, that the Articles of peace made between the Romans and the Carthaginians, could not be vnderstood by the best Antiquaries of his time. That the Latine tongue was generally spoken in all the Prouinces of the Roman Empire, as some hold, I dare not think; being better perswaded

The next that setled themselues here, was Aeneas and his Troians; who flying from their ruined countrie, and enraged enimies, & seeking new habitations, were by tempest first cast on the shore of Africa. There they were (as Virgil hath it) entertained by Dido, then busie in the building of Carthage; who so much doted on the perfections of this new commer, that she yeelded her body and Citty to his disposall. But this being not the place where Aeneas posterity was to erect a fourth Monarchie, hee priuately stole thence nto Italy, wherevpon the discontented Lady slew her selfe. This relation h

Credible it is that Aeneas being driuen on the coast of Africke, was by some Prince there curteously entertained, as a man whose same had beene his harbinger: but why the story should fasten it on Dido, I see not. Perhaps the vnfortunate death of this Queene, who laid violent hands on her selfe, gaue occasion to the Poet to faine that it was for the loue of Aeneas; whereas it was indeed to avoid the lust and furie of Iarbas, a potent king in Africke, who violently desired to haue his pleasure on her. Whether Aeneas euer were in Africke or not; or who it was that welcomed him thither, it matters not: certaine it is, that in Italy he ariued in an happy houre. For he was no sooner landed then gently entertained by Latinus King of the Laurentini; who to make his loue more apparant, espowsed his only child Lavinia vnto him. Hence grew the warres between Turnus K. of the Rutili a former suiter, and him; which being extinguished by the death and vanquishment of the Rutilian, confirmed the Troians in a setled peace. For now growing with the Laurentini, by many intermarriages, into a more constant bond of friendship; they built the Towne called after the name of their Queene, Lavinia; making it their residence for their Princes, till Longa Alba was built by Alba Silvius, a succeeding King, and made the chiefe of the kingdome.

Then Romulus laid the foundation of Rome, & tempered the morter with the bloud of his brother Rhemus, who disdainefully had leapt ouer the new walls.

vulgarly called the Ovation; which differed in many circū
                     stances. For 1 the Triumpher entreth in a royall Chariot, and is met by the Senatours in their ornaments: but the Ovator entreth on foot, and is met only by the Knights and Gentlemen of Rome. 2•, The Triumpher had a Lawrell Crowne, & entered with the noyse of Drummes and Trumpets: but the Ovator, a Garland of Firre, with Flutes & Hoboyes playing before him. 3•. The Triumpher was attired in a garment of state; the O

                        or in a plaine purple gowne only. 4ly, In a Triumph the Souldiers cryed out Io triumphe: in an Ovation they cryed onely O, O, O; the often doubling of which noyse made it bee called (as some thinke) Ovation. 5ly, and lastly, the Triumpher vsed in his sacrifice to offer a certaine number of Oxen: but the Ovator only offered a sheepe; whence the name is more properly to be deriued. Now Ovation was in three cases granted. 1 If the Generall had subdued his enimies with little or no bloudshed, so that there were not slaine 5000 men; or by perswasion more then battaile. 2ly, If the warres had been flight, cursory, or not lawfully managed. And 3ly, if it had beene against an ignoble enimie. Of this last we haue a faire instance in P. Rupilio, who being Victor in the Servile war (or the war wherein the bondslaues made head against the R

                           •
                        . The greater Triumphs were indeed full of magnificence: the state whereof, who list to see, may finde it fully set downe by Plutarch, in the Tr

                        mph of Paulus Aemylius. Yet by this which wee haue said by way of Antithesis, not a little may be obserued. This greater triumph was notwithstanding, not alwaies giuen to such as deserued it; there being many waies to hinder, or forfeit it. 1 Sometimes it was denied a Conqueror by the strength of a contrary faction: so Pompey denied Metellus his Triumph for the conquest of Crete. 2l, Sometimes it was by the Conquerours omi

                     l, Sometimes the Souldiers hauing beene ill paid, or too much streightned;

would not permit their Generall to triumph: and this was P. Aemylius case, because hee deuided not among the men of war (according to his promise) the spoyles of Greece. 4ly, Sometimes because the Generall had borne no publique office in the Citty: so (in Livie) Lentulus returning Proconsull out of Spaine required a Triumph: to which the fathers answered, that he had indeed done things worthy that honour, but they had no president for it; Vt qui ne

                           que
                         Praetor res gessisset, triumphaxet. 5ly, Sometimes the Generalls themselues omitted it, for the furtherance of some of their other designes: So Caesar comming toward Rome in Triumph, the same time the Consulls were chosen; quitted his Triumph to sue for the Consulship: it being the custome that such as demanded the Triumph should abide without the Citty, and such as sued for the Consulship must of necessity be within. 6ly, It was denied whē the warre had beene vndertaken without the command of the Senate: So it hapned to Manlius, hauing to the great enlargement of the Empire; yet without commission surprized Gallatia; quia causam belli Senatus non approbauit. 7ly, If the warres had beene ciuill betweene the Romans themselues, there was no Triumph allowed to the Victor; because in all such victories the Commonwealth was depriued of some part of her selfe: So Pompey and Metellus hauing vanquished Sertorius in Spaine; Externum magis id bellum quàm ciuile videri voluerunt vt triumpharent. 8ly, If the conquest had beene gotten not without great losse on the Romans side: For this was Valerius conquerour of the Gau
                           •
                        es denied this honour; Quia magis dolor ciuibus amissis, quàm gandium fusis hostibus praevaluit (saith Macrobius) 9l•, and lastly, if the seruice had not beene performed in the Generalls owne Province: So when Livius and Nero being Consuls▪ ouercame Hasdrubal, Livins only triumphed because the warre had beene managed in his Prouince; whereas indeed Nero was the man that wonne the day. And these are all, or at least the chief causes of hindring or omitting this honor: which certainly was the most eminent that euer the free state was capable of. When the Commonwealth was changed into a Monarchie, this honour seemed too great for Subiects; & was first

The last Emperour whom wee finde in Histories to haue triumphed was Probus, after his victories ouer the Germans: and the Blemyi a people of Africke, about the yeare 284. But I haue beene too tedious in this discourse. I returne vnto Romulus, who hauing vanquished the Ceninenses, & made peace with the Sabines, reigned victoriously in his new Citty the space of 37 yeares.

The last Consull was one Basilius in the raigne of Iustinian, Anno 541. The first were two worthy men, namely Collatinus, husband to Lucretia; & Iuniu

The people free from feare of the Kings, for want of imployment at home, ouerburdened their neighbours abroad, whom after the space of 500 yeares they subdued: a matter truely worth consideration, that the Italians should hold out against the puissance of Rome 500 yeares, when as almost all the rest of the world was subdued in little more then 200. So great a matter was it (saith Florus) to contract the many bodies of Italy vnder one head.

               After Italy was subdued, Pyrrhus of Epirus was beaten home by them; and next the ouerthrow of the Carthaginians cast many faire possessions into the lap of Rome: who now become the mistrisse of the world, grew likewise oppressed by her owne greatnesse; and therefore willing to be supported. This aduantage Caesar espying, like an officious Gentleman Vsher laid hold of her armes, and from her seruant became her master; first with the title of perpetuall Dictator, and next of absolute Emperour: and after he had ruled fiue yeares, was with 23 wounds murdered

                  43 Constantinus M. 31. This Emperour though very religious, as being the first Christian Emperour, did more preiudice the Empire then any of his predecessours, first in translating the Imperiall seat from Rome to Bizantium, by which transplantation the Empire lost much of its naturall vigour; as we see in Plants and Flowres, who being remoued

A second fault of this Constantine was the diuiding of the Empire betweene his children For though it was quickly againe reunited, yet by his example others learned the same lesson, renting the Empire in peeces, which occasioned the losse of the whole. The former Emperours vsed indeed to associate sometimes their sonnes or brothers with them; yet so, that they were ioyntly Lords of it, as of one entire regiment: but Constā
                        tine, if I remember aright, was the first which allotted to particular men, particular iurisdiction. The third fault of this Prince, was his translating the Legions and Colonies which lay on the north Marches, into the easterne country, as a Bulwark against the Persians: thereby opening that passage, by which not long after the barbarous nations entred. For though insteed of these Colonies, he planted Garrisons & Forts, yet th

So that Zosimus (though in other of his reports concerning this Prince hee bewrayes much malice) truely calleth him the first subverter of that flourishing Monarchie. To these three causes may bee added a fourth, concerning the Emperours in general, namely their stupid negligence, and degenerate spirits. Italy notwithstanding continued a member of the Empire till the yeare 399, in which Theodosius the great diuided againe the Empire:

                        , rumpo; because that here it is thought that Sicily was broken from Italy. 5 Locris, where liued the Lawmaker Zaleucus, who ordering adultery to be punished with the losse of both their eyes, was compelled to execute his law on his son the first offender. Therfore to shew the loue of a Father, and sincerity of a Iudge, he put out one of his sonnes eyes, and one of his own. He also prouided in his Lawes, that no woman should be attended with more then one maid in the street, but when she was drunk; that she should not goe out of the City in the night, but when she went to commit adultery: that she should not weare gold or embroydered apparel, but when she purposed to be a common strumpet: that men should not weare rings and tissues, but when they went a-whoring and the like: by which lawes both men and women were restrained from all extraordinary traines of attendants, and excesse of apparell; this last, asault in our times too common. This town was formerly also famous for the victory of Eunomus, an excellent Musitian; vpon Aristonus of Rhegium, an other of the same profession. For though Aristonus had made his prayers to Apollo, the god of Musick, to grant him the conquest; yet Eunomus plainly told him, that nature was against him; who had made all the Grasse-hoppers on his side of the water, mute. The day being come, one of the strings of Eunomus harpe in the midst of his playing, brake; when presently a Grassehopper leaped vpon his harpe, and supplyed the defect of his string, by which means the victory was adjudged to Eunomus. And indeed it is by diuers affirmed, that betweene Locris & Rhezo i

These men hauing bin often terrified with a vain rumour of their enemies approach; promulgated a law, forbidding all such reports: by which meanes their enemies comming vnawares vpon them, took the town.

They were so effeminate and delicate, that they permitted no smith or copper-man to dwell in their town, lest the noyse of the workers should disturbe their rest. Fidlers and singers they had in request; which occasion the Cretonians their aduersaries embracing, entred the town, apparelled like Musitians, and mastred it. Before this accident, there was a prophesie giuen, that the town should neuer be taken, till men were more esteemed then gods. It happened that a seruant being beaten by his master, and for the gods sake obtaining no mercy, fled to the monument of his masters Auncestors, & was pardoned. Amyris the Philosopher hearing this, forsooke the town; most men holding him mad, in a time of no danger to leaue so delicious a seat; hence grew the proverb, Amyris insaint, applyed to such as vnder shew of madnes, or folly, prouide for their own safety. 6 St Severine.

There was by hap a little child of this familie left at home, who did againe restore the house, & was the Ancestor of Fab. Maximus, the preseruer of Italy against Annibal. This citty at last, after a tenne yeares siege was taken by Furius Camillus, and not long after leuelled with the earth, because the Roman people so delighted in the situation of the place, that they were resolued to haue forsooke Rome, and dwelt there. 9 Tivolis where there is a fountaine, which by artificiall workes driuen with water, representeth the notes of diuers birds. 10 Rome, once the Mistresse of the vniverse, famous for her triumphs and antiquities; is seated on Tiber now well growne by the receit of 42 riuers, and is distant from the Sea fifteene miles. This citty built by Romulus, was in circuit about two miles, and contained 30000 inhabitants: which in the flourishing of that common-wealth, increased to 463000,
                           Ortelius.
                         and the compasse of the Towne to fiftie miles, there being on the walls aboue 740 Turrets. When I said there were 463000 inhabitants, I mean not also seruants, women and children; but men able to beare armes, free denizens, & such as were inrolled into cense. To these if we adde their children, wiues, and seruants, we cannot probably coniecture them to haue beene fewer then 3 or 4 millions: and so Lipsius in his tract de magnitudine Romana, is of opinion. The extent of the Roman Empire was answerable to the multitude of inhabitants,
                           Brerewood.
                         the revenue correspondent to the extent. It was in length about 2000 miles; namely from the Irish Ocean West, to the riuer Euphrates on the East: in bredth it reached from the Danubius Northward, to mount Atlas on the South, about 2000 miles. And though the Romans had extended their Dominions sometimes farther East then North; yet could they neuer quietly settle themselues in these conquests. Nature, it seemeth, had appointed them these bounds, not so much to limit their empire, as to defend it; for the enimies found these riuers, by reason of the depth of the channell, and violent current of the streame as a couple of impregnable fortresses, purposely erected to hinder them from harasing the Roman Country. The revenewes Lipsius in the former tract esteemeth to be about 150 millions of Crownes▪ and that they were no lesse, may bee made more then

probable by these reasons. 1 It is affirmed by diuers, & among others by Boterus that the yearely revenewes of the king of China amount vnto 120 millions of Crownes; & if this be true (as few question it) we cannot in proportion guesse the whole Empire of the Romans to yeeld lesse then 150 millions: especially considering what arts masters the Romans were in levying and raysing their taxes, and customary tributes. 2ly, The Legionary Souldiers which were dispersed ouer the Provinces, receaued in ordinary pay (besides provision of corne, apparell, & officers wages) fiue millions, and 516062l and 10s of our money; which amounteth vnto 16 millions of Crownes, or thereabout. In the Citty it selfe there were kept in continuall pay, 7000 Souldiers of the watch, 4 or 6000 for the defence of the Citty, and 10000 for the guard of the Emperours persons. The two first had the same wages; the last, the double wages of a Legionary Souldier. Adde hereto the expences of the pallace, and other meanes of disbursalls, & I thinke nothing of the sum can be abated. 3ly, we read that C. Caligula spent in one yeare two millions and 700000 of Sestertiums: how Nero most lavishly gaue away two millions and 100000 of Sestertiums: & how Vitollius in a few months was 900000 of Sestertiums in arrerages. All huge and infinite summes. 4ly, When Vespasian came to the Empire, the Exchequer was so impouerished, that he protested in open Senate, that hee wanted to settle the Common-wealth 40 millions of Sest
                              •

                              •
                            est. Now vnlesse the ordinary revenewes came to as much, or more then we haue spoken, by what meanes could this extraordinary summe be raised. 5ly, Wee may guesse at the generall revenew, by the monies issuing out of particular Provinces; and it is certaine that Aegypt afforded to the Ptolomies 12000 Talents yearely, neither had the Romans lesse, they being more perfect in inhancing then abating their intradoe. France was by Caesar cessed at the yearely tribute of 20 millions of Crownes: And I thinke the rest of the Provinces were rated accordingly. 6ly, and lastly, the infinite summes of money giuen by the Emperours in way of largesse, are proofes sufficient for the greatnesse

of the income. I will instance in Augustus only, & in him, omitting his donatiues at the v

The maine argument the aduersaries haue out of the Scriptures is taken out of the first of Peter, the fift Chap. and 13 ver. where the Apostle saith, The Chu

Since they so honestly and freely grant the one, I see not any inconuenience that would follow if we granted the other. And so let Peter bee at Rome, and Rome be Babylon, the Popes the whores therof. That Peter was the Prince of the Apostles, or that his suffering there could cō

with the Bishops of Rome for superiority; the seat of Religion commonly following the seat of the Empire. And the Bishops of Constantinople prevailed so farre, that with the permission of Mauritius the Emperour, hee tooke vpon him the title of Vniuersall Patriarch. Gregory the great (of whom it is said that he was the worst Bishop of all that went before him, and the best of all that came after him) was at that time Bishop of Rome. He sharply inveighed as well against the Emperour, as the Patriarch of Constantinople for this title; and plainely maintained that whosoeuer called himselfe Vniuersall Bishop, was the forerunner of Antichrist. As for himselfe, it is probable that he tooke the title of servus servorum Dei, more in opposition to him of Constantinople, then with an intent to be so. To this our aduersaries answere, that Gregory did not absolutely condemne this title; but only blamed Iohn the Constantinopolitan Patriarch, for assuming to himselfe the attribute which properly belonged to the See of Rome. But this cannot be; for then we should either in the old Bulls of the former Popes, find mē

                        180 Vrban III. now liuing. To These 180 Popes, adde the 63 Bishops; & they make the full number of 243.
                     
                     It were a taske too great for Hercules, to shew all the acts and pious decrees of all these ghostly fathers: We will therfore only make mention of some principall passages, for the better vnderstanding of their history and policies.
                     
                        1. Paschalis the first, caused the Priests of some Parishes in Rome, by reason of their neerenesse to his person, their presence at his election, and to honour their authority with a more venerable title, to be called Cardinals. They are now mates for Kings, and numbred about 70.
                        2. Eugenius the second took on him the authority of creating Earles, Dukes, and knights; as the Exarchs of Ravenna had formerly vsed to doe.
                        3. Sergius the second was the first that changed his name; for thinking his own name Bocca di Porco, or Swines-mouth, not consonant to his dignity; he caused himself to be called Sergius: which president his successours following, doe also vary their names. So that if one be a coward, he is called Leo; if a Tyrant, Clemens; if an Atheist, Pius or Innocons; if a Rustick, Vrbanus; and so of the rest.
                        4. Nicholas the second, took from the Roman Clergie, the election of the Popes, allotting it to the Con

                           laue ol Cardinals.
                        
                        5. Nicholas the third, was the first Pope that practised to enrich his kindred, and his successours haue studied nothing more then to aduance their Nephewes, (for by that name the Popes vse to call their bastards:) whence came that worthy saying of Alexander the third; The lawes forbid vs to get children, and the Diuell hath giuen vs Nephewes in their steed.
                        6. Iohn the eight, is by most writers confessed to be a woman,

and is vsually called Pope Ioane. To auoid the like disgrace, the Porphyrie chaire was ordained; Vbi ab ultimo Diacono, &c. so that both in a literall and mysticall sense, this woman may be called, The whore of Babylon.
                        
                        
                           
                              Fox Mart.
                           7. Innocent the third held a councell in Rome; in which it was enacted, that the Pope should haue the correction of all Christian Princes, and that no Emperour should be acknowledged, till he had sworne obedience to him: He invented Transul stantiation; and ordeined that there should be a Pix to couer the Bread, and a Bell to be rung before it. He also brought Aur

                              cular Confession into the Church.
                        8. Sixtus the fourth builded in Rome, Stewes of both sexes, he brought in Beades; and made our Ladies Psalter.
                        9. Sergius the third instituted the bearing about of Candles, for the purification of the blessed Virgin Mary.
                        
                        10. Nicholas the first prohibited the Clergie marriage, saying; that it was more honest to haue to doe with many women priuatly, than openly to take one wife. Insomuch that a Priest of Placentia being accused to haue wife & children, was depriued of his Benefice; but proouing the said woman to be the wife of another man, and but his Concubine, he was again restored.
                        11. Celestine 2d was the inventor of that mad cursing, by Bell, Booke, and Candle.

Leo 10th sent a consecrated rose to Fredericke Duke of Saxonie, desiring him to banish Luther. The like did Clement 7th to our Henry 8th, for writing against Luther. So Paul the third sent an hallowed sword to Iames the fift of Scotland, when he began the warre with our Henry 8th. The like did Iulius the second to our Henry 7th, in his warres against his Rebels.
                        15. Boniface the eight, instituted the Roman Iubile, and decreed that it should be solemnized euery hundred yeare; but by Clement the sixt, it was brought to fifty.

Peter, and his successours. Hereunto they joyned the merits of the Virgin Mary, & all the Saints; so that this treasure can neuer be drawn dry: and hereon he founded the vertue of Pardons and Indulgences.
                        18. Leo the tenth, was indeed a great fauourer of learning, but so little sauoured he of Religion, that he was often heard to say, Quantas nobis divitias comparavit ista fabula Christi: a speech so blasphemous, that Porphyrie, or Iulian the Apostata's could neuer match it. In his time began the Reformation according to the Word of God taught by Luther.

                     We before touched at Constantines donation, avouching it to be forged; and well might we so doe, considering how fearefull the Popes are, in hauing their title disputed, insomuch that many leaues are razed out of Guicciardine by the Inquisition, where this donation was called in question. In the place, the hist
                           ••
                        rian not only denieth the fained donation of Constantine, but affirmes that diuers learned men reported Silvester and him to haue liued in diuers ages. Then he sheweth how obscure and base the authority of the Popes was, during the time that the barbarous Nations made havock of Italy: 2ly, that in the institution of the Exarchate, the Popes had nothing to doe with the temporall sword; but liued as subiects to the Emperours, 3ly, that they were not very much obeyed in matters spirituall, by reason of the corruption of their manners. 4ly, that the ouerthrow of the Exarchate, the Emperours now neglecting Italy, the Romans began to be gouerned by the aduice and power of the Popes. 5ly, that Pepin of France, and his son Charles; hauing ouerthrowne the kingdome of the Lombards, gaue vnto the Popes, the Exarchate, Vrbine, Ancona, Spoleto; and many other townes and territories about Rome. 6ly, that the Popes in all their Bulls or Charters, expressed the date in these formall words; Such a one our Lord the Emperor raigning. 7l•, that long after the translation of the Empire from France to Germany, the Popes began to make open protestation, that the Pontificall dignity was rather to giue Lawes to the Emperours, then receiue any from them. 8ly, that being thus raised to an earthly power, they forgot the saluation of soules, sanctity of life, and the commandements of God, propagation of Religion, & charity towards men. To raise armes, to make warre against Christians, to invent new deuices for getting of money, to prophane sacred things for their own ends, and to enrich their kindred & children; was their only studie. And this is the substance of Guicciardine in that place, an author aboue all exception; he was a

man whom the Popes imployed in many businesses of rare importance, so that no hate to them, but loue to the truth made him write thus much. As for the city of Rome, so vnlikely is it to haue bin giuen by Constantine, that neither Pepin, nor Charles his son could be induced to part with it. Lewis surnamed Pius is said to be the first donour thereof, and a copie of this donation is found in the third booke of Volaterran, subscribed by the Emperour, his three sonnes, ten Bishops, eight Abbots, fifteene Earles, and the Popes Library-keeper. Yet Lampadius in his Comment on Sleidan affirmeth, that it was by many learned and judicions men maintained, that all this was foisted into the text by Anastasius the Popes Library-keeper, who is cited as a witnes of the donatiō. Let vs hear what the recorder of Florence saith in this case. Rome (saith he) was alwaies subiect to the Lords of Italy, till Theodorick king of the Gothes remooued his seat to Rauenna, for hereby the Romans were enforced to submit themselues to the Bishops, Ao 460 or there about. And againe talking of the estate of the Popedome in the yeare 931. The Popes (saith he) had in Rome more or lesse authority according to the fauour they found with the Emperours, or others then most mighty. But the leauing of Italy by the German Emperours, seated the Pope in a more absolute soueraignty ouer the Citty.
                     Hauing thus a little glanced at the meanes by which the present demaines of the Church of Rome, were first gotten and increased: Let vs consider by what policies this Papall Monarchy hath beene vpheld in respect and magnificence. They may be diuided into three heads. 1 Those by which they haue insinuated and screwed themselues into the affections and affaires of the most potent Princes. 2 Those by which already they haue and by which hereafter they will be a
                           •
                        le to secure their own estate. And 3d, those by which they keepe the people both in blindnesse, and due obedience.
                     1. Concerning the first:
                           Sands relig.
                         First, the donation of seuerall kingdomes to them that haue no right or title, but from the Pope, and in force of his donation; cannot but oblige them to him, without whom they could lay no title to what they possesse.

2ly Next the readines of their Ministers to kill such as resist thē, cannot but deterre Princes from injuring them, and constraine them to seek their friendship: especially since by a w
                           •
                        it of Excommunication they can arme the subiects against the Soueraigne; and without levying a Souldier, either vtterly destroy him, or bring him to good conformity. 3ly Then followes their allowance of marriages prohibited by God & Nature, the issue of which, cannot but vphold the Popes infinite authority; without whom, their birth is vnnaturall, and their persons not capable of the estates which by his allowance they hold; wherein they strengthen themselues more, by vnlawfull matches of others, then euer Prince could by lawfull marriage of his owne. 4ly They commeth in their dispensing with the Oathes of Princes, by which such Princes both preserue their credit, in not being perjur'd, as they think, since allowed by the Church: and also get somewhat for which they cannot be vnthankfull to the Papacie. 5ly Then succeedeth in order the choosing of the yonger sons of potent families into their Cardinalships: by which meanes, the whole linage are ready to support him, as the chief staffe of their brother or Cosens preferment. 6ly As by these courses hee holds in with all Princes of his religion in generall; so hath he fastned o
                           •
                         the King of Spaine in particular, by making him and his successours the executioners of his excommunications. By this office Ferdinando the Catholique surprized Navarre; and Philip the 2d had no small hopes to haue done the like on England and France.
                     
                     2. Concerning the second: so it is, that first their state hath the firmest foundation of any; as being laid in the conscience of men, by perswading them of their infallible power: and the Ecclesiasticall and temporall jurisdiction ouer Heauen, Hell, Earth and their Purgatory. 2ly Next commeth the innumerable preferments for men of all sorts and humors, (as hauing well high in their disposing, all the Benefices and Bishopricks of Italy, halfe in Spaine, diuers in France and Germany:) which keep the Clergie in a perpetuall bond of allegeance; especially inioying diverse priuiledges which they of the Temporalty are not capable of. 3ly Then consider the multitude of Friers, all whose

hopes depend on his safety: they are known to be more then a Million, of which halfe at least would grow fit to be imployed in any warlike seruice; all which they doe maintaine at other mens cost, themselues not disbursing a penny. 4ly Their Revenues they increase by their Pardons and Indulgences; amongst others I read of a Pardon giuen by Pope Boniface 8th, of whom it is said, he entred like a Fox, liu'd like a Lyon, and died like a dog▪ it was a Pardon for 82000 yeares to all them, which would say such a prayer of St 
                        Augustine, and that for euery day

                           ties quoties. 5ly The next help of their Coffers is their dealing with Peniten
                              •
                           s, whom in the agony of their soules they perswade, that no help will be easily had, vnlesse by a donation of part of their estates to the Church. 6ly The last string to this Bow, is the invention of spirituall fraternities, which are appurtenances or annexaties to the orders of Friers; and may in number perhaps equall them. Into these the lay-people of all sorts, men and women, married and single, desire to be inrolled; as hereby injoying the spirituall prerogatiues of Indulgences and speedy dispatch out of Purgatory.
                     3. Concerning the thi
                           •
                        d; 1, they deterre the people from reading the Scripture; alledging vnto them the perils they may incurre by misinterpretatiō: 2ly they breed an antipathy between the Papists and the Protestants; insomuch that a Papist may not say Amen vnto a Protestants Deo gratias. 3ly they debarre them all sound of the religion, in prohibiting the bookes of the reformed Writers; & hiding their own treatises, in which the tenent of the Protestants is recited only to be cōfuted: insomuch that in all Italy you shal seldome meet with Bellarmines works, or any of the like nature to be sold. 4ly They haue vnder pain of excommunication, prohibited the Italians from trauell & traffick with hereticall countries▪ or such places where those contagious sounds and sights (as they tearme them) might make thē returne infected. 5ly The seuerity, or tyranny rather, of the Inquisi
                              •
                           ion, of which we haue elswhere spoken, crusheth not only the beginnings, but the smallest suspitions of being this way addicted. And 6ly the people thus restrained from trauell, are taught to belieue, that the Protestants are blasphemers of God

and all his Saints: that in England Churches are turned to stables, the people is growne barbarous, and eat young children: that Geneva is a professed sanctuary of roguerie, and the like. We haue yet two later examples of their dealing in this kind: 1 the grosse slander of the Apostasie (or as they call it, the revnion) vnto their Church, of the right reverend Father in God, D• 
                        King, late Lord Bishop of London; a Prelate of too known a faith and zeale, to giue occasion for such a calumnie. The second is a book by them lately published, and comm
                           •
                        nly sold in Italy, and France; containing a relation of Gods Iudgments, shown on a sort of Protestant-Hereticks, by the fall of an house in Blacke-Friers in London, in which they were assembled to heare a Geneva Lecture; by which dealing, the simple people are made to belieue that to be a judgment on vs, which the authors of that pamphlet well know, to be a calamity (I will

                     Had these Pontificall Prelates bin chosen young, or of the same family, so that the successour had not through envie, or a new humour, crossed the designes of his predecessour: it cannot be but that this Monarchie had bin greater and better established, then the old Romane in her greatest glory. But this course is distastefull to the ambition of the C

                        e by all meanes, both of loue and money, to that dignity. Now the elections of the Popes are made in this place and manner: for I suppose it will not be impertinent to speak a little hereof. In the Popes Palace in the hill Vatican, are among other buildings, 5 halls, 2 chappels, and a gallerie 70 foot long. The gallery is appointed for conference; the one chappell for the masse, & for the election; the other with the Halls are for the Cardinals lodgings. Euery Hall hath two rowes of chambers, which are purposely for the time made of green or violet cloath. To each Cardinall is allowed foure seruants to lye in his chamber. They that are once within, are compelled, vnlesse they be sicke, still to continue there: and such as are once out, are no more permitted to goe in; lest by that meanes the Cardinals should maintain intelligence with any forraine Princes. To this Conclaue
                        
(for by this name the place of the election is called) is but one doore, to which belongeth foure locks, and as many keyes. One key is in the keeping of the Cardinals; one of the City-Bishops; one of the Roman nobility; and one of the Master of the ceremonies. There is in this doore a litle wicket or hatch, which is opened only at dinners and suppers; and whereof the Master of the ceremonies keepeth the key. At this hole the Cardinals seruants receiue their Meate; euery dish being first diligently searched, lest any letters should be conveyed in them. As for the Lodgings, they haue neither holes nor windowes to giue light, so that there they make day of wax-candles: And lest the Pope should be made by force, both the City and Conclaue are strongly guarded. When the Cardinals are going to election, the priuiledges of the Cardinals are recited; which euery one sweareth to obserue, in case he be chosen Pope. Then the Master of the ceremonies ringing a Bell, calleth them all to Masse; which ended, there is brought to euery Cardinall, a chaire, and therein a scroll of all the Cardinals names. Before the altar is set a table, couered with a purple cloath, whereupon is set a chalice, a siluer bell; and about it six stooles, on which sit two Bishops, two Priests, and two Deacons. Euery Cardinall writeth is voyc

The first Bishop taketh out all the papers, and deliuereth them to the first Deacon, who vnfolding each of them, readeth (without mentioning the name of the Electour) the name of the elected: and euery Cardinall in his particular scroll, noteth how many voices euery one hath.

He that hath the most voyces, so that his voyces exceed the proportion of two parts of three, is acknowledged Pope, and adored by the rest of the Cardinals; but if they exceed not that number, they must begin all anew. If in the space of 30 dayes the election be not

fully ended▪ then must the Cardinals be kept from fire, light & victuals, till they are fully agreed The

                        r of the Monkes: he

liued 105 yeares, and died Anno 345.
                     After this foundation, the Monasticall building increased so fast, that it seemed necessary to prescribe them orders: Hereupō 
                        St. Basil gathered them together, liuing formerly dispersed, and was the first that built Monasteries; he is said to haue ordained the three vowes, 1 of Pouerty, 2 of obedience to their rules; and 3 of perpetuall chastity: he instructed them in good Arts, and true Religion, and the seruice of God, with Watchings, Prayers, and Hymnes.
                     The next that prescribed orders was St 
                        Austin, borne Anno he being thirty yeares old, obtained a garden without the walls of Hippo, where he begun this order, assuming onely twelue into his company. The first Monastery of them was erected by William Duke of Guyen at Paris; and Anno 1200, they began to flourish in Italy by the fauour of Iohn Duke of Mantua.
                     
                     The third was Benedict, borne at Nursia in Vmbria, Anno 482, he gathered the Monkes of Italy together, and gaue them a rule in writing; he liued till he had seen twelue Monasteries filled with his Disciples: Their habit was a loose gown of black, reaching down to their feet: their vnder garment was white woollen, their legges booted, their Crownes shaued; their heads hooded. Of this order haue bin 52 Popes, 200 Cardinals, 1600 Archbishops, 4000 Bishops, and 50000 Saints, which haue bin approued by the Church.
                     The fourth was St 
                        Francis, borne at Asis, he fell from M

                        rchandise to Religion, going barefoot, and behauing himself very penitently; hereupon great store of disciples following him, he gaue them a rule wherein they are bound to professe pouerty and beggery; he caused them to be called Minors, to shew their humility; but now they are called Franciscans. This order was confirmed 1212.
                     Now concerning these orders of Friers, certaine it is, that at their first institution they were a people much reueren
                           •
                        ed for their holy life, as men that for Christs sake abandoned all the pompes and vanities of the world. And questionlesse they then were a people altogether mortified; and who by their very aspects

would gaine vpon the affection of the hardest hearts;
                           Sleidan com.
                         insomuch that not only meane men, but great personages also did desire to be buried in a Friers weed: as Francis the 2d, Marquesse of Mantua; Albertus Pius an other Prince of Italy; & in later times the great Scholler Christopher Longolius. But as Florus saith of the ciuill warres between Pompey and Caesar, Causa huius bell▪ eadem quae omnium, nimia felicitas: so may I say of these cloystred Friers, the greatnes of their wealth, which many on a superstitious deuotion bequeathed to their houses, brought them first into a neglect of their former religiou

                         and demure carriage: 2ly into a rechlesnesse of their credit and actions: and lastly by consequence into contempt: so that there was not a people vnder heauen that was more infamous in themselues, or more grossely abused by others. Hence the vulgar saying of the people, When a Frier receiveth the razor, the diuell entreth into him: and Friers weare crosses on th

                        Thomas Moore, who in the Popes cause lost his head, sticketh not to call them in his Vtopia, Errones maximi; and that they were to bee comprehended vnder the statutes, made against vagabonds and sturdy beggers. Now to shew both the passions of respect and contempt of these Friers: There goeth a tale how the Lady Moore, S• 
                        Thomas his wife, finding a Friers girdle, shewed it with great joy to her husband, saying; behold Sir Thomas, a step toward Heauen: to which, he with a disdainfull laugh made answere, that he feared that step would not bring her a step higher. As for this retirednesse and solitarinesse of life, so it is, that many Kings, chiefly of our Kingdome, and especially vnder the Saxon H

and the Iewes which liue aboundantly in Rome and Italy, euen abhorre this vnsociable life; preferring a ciuill life farre before a solitary; as being to nature more agreeable; to man more profitable; and by consequence, to God more acceptable. So hauing spoken thus much of Friers in generall, I descend now to particulars.
                     
                        The particular orders of Friers.

                           4. Of Comald, begun in Italy, 1012, by Romoald of Ravenna. Their first Monastery was built nigh vnto Arezzo in the Dutchy of Florence, by one Comald, hence the name: they continue in their old strictnesse; their Roabe is white; they follow the rule of Saint Benedict.
                        
                        3. Of Val d'Ombre, begun by Iohn Gualbert a Florentine, 1040, who betaking himselfe to the study of Religion, retired to a place in the Appennine called Val Ombreux: his followers weare a smoakie habite, and follow the rule of Saint Bennet.

They eat no flesh; liue by couples; neuer meet but on Sundayes; labour with their hands, Watch, Pray, &c. their Roabe is white, with a short Cape.
                        5. Of Cisteaux, instituted by Robert, Abbot of Molesme, who with 21 of his religiousest Monks, retired to Cisteaux in Purgundie; where Bernard a great Lord, became of their Order: who built and repaired 160 Abbies. Their Roabe is a white Cassock, girt with a girdle of wooll; the rest black: they eat no flesh; and follow Saint Bennet.
                        
                        6. Carmelites, so called from Mount Carmel in Syria, were insti

                           7. Dominicke, Preaching, or Black-Friers, instituted by Saint Dominicke a Spaniard; he put himselfe in orders with 16 of his disciples 1206▪ then sent he his associats to preach the Gospel euen to the farthest parts of the world, which both they did, & thei

                        8. Celestines, instituted by one Peter a Samnite, borne 1215 He alwayes wore a chaine of iron next his flesh, & ouer that a shirt of haire. Pope Gregory the eleuenth confirmed this rule: they follow Saint Bennet, and took name from the said Peter, who for his sanctity was chosen Pope, and called Cel

                        10. Capouchins, so called of their Cowle or Capouch, ordeined by Mathew Basci of Ancona. Frier Lewis his companion obtained of the Pope, the habit and rule of S. Francis, 1526: in the space of 42 yeares, they increased to 2240 associats, had 222 Monasteries, and were diuided into fifteen Prouinces.
                        
                           11.

Crossed Friers, vulgarly called Crouched Friers, were ordeined by Cyriacus a Hierosolymitan Bishop, who shewed vnto Helena the place where the Crosse was hid: hence this order: which being almost decayed, Pope Innocent the third repaired. Their roabe was of watchet colour, and in their hands they carried the figure of the Crosse.

It is reported, that a Iesuite being in the midst of his Masse, which they call the sacrifice of the altar, was sent for by Ignatius, to whom, leauing off his Masse, he went immediatly: Ignatius hauing no businesse wherein to employ him, told him, that he only sent for him to try his obedience; and withal prophanely added, that Obedience was better taen sacrifice: and this is called, the blind obedience of the Iesuites.

Of these Nunnes I will instance only in two orders, viz: that of Saint Clare as being the strictest, and that of Saint Brigit, as inioying most liberty.

                        Clara was a Knights daughter of Asis, where Saint Francis was borne, with whom she was contemporarie; and with whose austere life she was so affected, that she forsooke her fathers house, and followed him. Hauing learned her lirrie of that Frier-monger, she composed an order of Religious Virgins, and had it confirmed by Pope Honorius 3d, Anno 1225. Her followers professe pouerty, goe barefoot, feed meanly, and are indeed too much straightned.
                     Saint Brigit was Queene of Swethland, & comming to Rome on devotion, obtained of Pope Vrban the 5th, that Friers and Nunnes might in some places liue together, Anno 1372. For she being a widow and a woman, knew best without question, what was good for both sexes; but little needed this cohabitation, for they had formerly bin conioyned in carnall affections, though parted by walls; neither were the Visitations so

                        Robinson, whom I aboue named, telleth vs, that at the time of his seruice in the English Nannery at Lisbone, he was shewed a trick, by which this vncharitable Grate, that seemed to keep the Friers from the company of their sweet votaries; might be, and was vpon such occasion, vsually remooued; and free accesse opened into one anothers beds. This he writeth of them, and for my part I dare beleeue it of all the rest of this order.
                     And now I returne to my Friers, who besides the maintenance which by their Founders is allotted vnto them; are kept in continuall possibility of attaining greater honours, if they continue dutifull to that See. For 1 there is not one of them, which hopeth not to be the Prior of his Covent; 2 Provinciall of his order, in that Country where he liueth; 3 the Generall of his order; 4 the Generals are most likely to be Cardinals; 5 your Cardinals are in the

But multitude of gouernours being for the most part accompanied with confusion, they chose them a Duke, Anno 709. Vnder these Dukes, they haue gotten that great Dominion, which they now inioy. The Dukes authority is but small, as being in all things subiect to the Senate, and three officers called the Capi; without whose consent he may not goe out of the town, & by whom he is prescribed an order in his apparell: So that he may be counted litle better then an honourable slaue. His revenue is as little as his authority, he being allowed out of the common treasurie, but 40000 Duckats in a yeare. The people of this City are either Gentlemen, or Artificers and Commons.

It is animated with all the vertues of old Rome, but if I coniecture aright, knit with a more constant temper; so that the present Rome, is but the carkasse of the old, of which she retaineth nothing but her ruines; and the cause of them, her sins.

It hath beene taken by the Venetians, and lost againe diuers times; but was finally conquered Ano 1390, or thereabout, Antonio Vermero being Duke of Venice. 2 Padua, formerly called Patauium, was built by Antenor, whose Tombe is still here to be shewne. The Vniversity was established Ano 1220, famous for Physitians, who haue here a garden of Simples, and for the birth of Livie, Zabarell, and Maginus. It was much renowned in former times for the humanity of the men, and chastity in the women: which was so eminent and famous,

In which negotiation he behaued himselfe so fully to the content of those that imployed him, that Paul the 3d intended Anno 1541, to haue made him Cardinall, had not some who envied him this honour, accused him of Lutheranisme. Hee to purge himselfe beganne to write a booke entituled Against the Apostata's of Germany: in the pursuit whereof pondering Luthers reasons, he became of his opinion; which once knowne, he was driuen from Iustinople. He submitted himselfe and his cause to the Fathers at Trent but could not get a hearing. Thence hee went to the D. of Mantua, from him to the State of Venice; but no where finding protection, he retired into Rhetia, and there preached the Gospell, till Christopher Duke of Wirtenberg, Ao 1548 placed him in his Vniver

Beatrix the Emperours wife, comming to see the Towne, was by the irreuerent people, first imprisoned; and then most barbarously handled. For they placed her on a Mule with her face towards the tayle,

which she was compelled to vse insteed of a bridle; and when they had thus shewne her to all the towne, they brought her to a gate, and kickt her out. To revenge this wrong the Emperour besieged and forced the Towne; and adiudged all the people to dye, saue such as would vndergoe this ransome. Betweene the buttocks of a skittish Mule, a bunch of Figges was fastned; and such as would liue, must with their hands bound behind, runne after the Mule, till with their teeth they had snatched out one or more of the Figges. This condition, besides the hazard of many a sound kicke, was by most accepted and performed. Since which time, the Italians when they intend to scoffe or disgrace one, vse to put their thumbe betweene two of their fingers and say Ecco, la fico: which is counted a disgrace answerable to our English custome, of making hornes to that man whom wee suspect to bee a Cuckold. After this, this Citty againe rebelled; and was by the same Emperour leuel'd with the ground, the wals pulled down, & all the platforme of the Citty ploughed vp and sowne with salt; that being the Embleme of a towne neuer in possibility to be reedified. This notwithstanding Millaine was againe rebuilt, and the Pope by the Millanoys & Venetians helpe, had the better of the Emperour; to whom the Pope inioyned a seruice in the Holy land. At this time, seeing the Emperour troubled with warres, the people began a Commonwealth, which continued about 56 yeares; when the Visconti, a potent fam

The first of this family which obtained the title of Duke, was Iohn called Galeazo, because at his birth the Cocks crew more then was ordinary: who for his dignity paid to the Emperour Wenceslaus 100000 Crownes. This Iohn so increased his dominions, that he was Lord of 29 Citties and their territories, & died going to Florence, that he might bee crowned king of Tuscany. He left one daughter married to Lewis Duke of Orleans; & two sonnes: Iohn Maria the elder, was slaine by the people; and Philip Maria succeeded in Millain. He dying, left one illegitimate daughter called Blanch, married to Francisco Sforza a braue

Souldier; and in his will named Alphonso of Arragon his heire▪ but in vaine, for Sforza was possessed of the Citty. In his line it continued, till the comming of Lewis the twelfth into Italy; who was King of France, sonne to Charles Duke of Orleans, sonne to Lewis a

Against these in severall Lewis prevailed, as also did Francis the first his next successour: but when the right of Spaine and the Empire met together in Charles the fift, then was King Francis taken prisoner, and for his release, was glad to release all title to Naples and Millain. A release long before endeauored by some French Politicians, because the keeping of this Dutchie, or its title, had brought such dammage to that Crowne: and as much opposed by Chancellour Prat; because it both kept the French in a continuall and certaine discipline of warre, and serued as a purgation of idle and superfluous people. Notwithstanding this release, king Francis renued the warre againe; during which the poore Millancys endured all the wretchednesse imaginable in a country so banded for, and tost from Potentate to Potentate. Antonio di Lena, the French gouernour in Millain, to provide for the pay of his Souldiers, had drawne into his hands all the victuall of the Citty, which he sold at his own price; which many poore people hauing no meanes to giue died in the streets. Yet this sufficed not. His Souldiers he quartered in the Citty; every of which, vsed as often as they wanted money, to chaine their hosts and then ransome them. Such as vpon this vsage fled the Citty, had their goods confiscate: the Nobles went but poorely arrayed; the principall places of the Citty were ouergrowne with Nettles and Brambles. In this miserable estate it continued, till Charles hauing totally driuen thence the French, restored it to Francis Sforzi brother to the l

While they were vnder the tuition of Millaine, their good Master Lodowicke Sforza, exacted a great masse of mony of them.

               OF BELGIA.
               ON the Northwest of Italy, lieth Germany, which is diuided into the higher, and the lower; this latter is called BELGIA, and Gallia Belgica:
                     Maginus.
                   It is bounded on the East with the Ems, and part of Germany; on the West with the German Sea; on the North with East-Freizeland; and on the South with the Some, Champaigne, and Lorraine.
               
               The names pertaining to the whole Region, are Belgia, from Belgus, once a King of this Country; and also the Low-Countries, and the Netherlands, from their low situation. The more peculiar is Flanders, which though but one of the Prouinces, hath yet for its fame, giuen denomination vnto Belgia; all whose inhabitants were once called Flemmings.

First, they were the farthest from Provence, where the Roman ciuility, & more affable course of life was embraced. 2ly, They dwelt on a Sea, not then frequented by Merchants; and so wanted those allurements to effeminacie, which are in Countries of

traffique. And 3ly they bord

But seeing they could not draw him out of his sortresse, they retired againe; but in such disorder, that three Legions (for no more was Caesars army) put them to an infinite slaughter. After this, Caesar fighting against them seuerally, ouercame them all.
               
                  Belgia, or the Netherlands, is in compasse 1000 miles, situate in the North temperat zone, vnder the 8•h and 11th Climats, the longest day being 17 houres.

                   The Aire in these latter dayes, is growne much more wholesome then formerly it hath beene, partly by the wonderfull increase of the Inhabitants; & partly by the industry of the people; who by drawing the marishes, & converting the standing waters, or channels, into running streames, haue purged the Aire of many grosse vapours, thence vsually arising.

To them also belong the invention of Chariots; the laying of colours with oyle; the working of pictures in glasse: and the making of Worsted, Sayes, Tapestrie, &c. The women generally are of a good complexion, wel proportioned, especially in the leg and foot; honourers of vertue, actiue, and familiar, Both within doores, and without, they gouerne all; which considering the naturall desire of women to beare rule, maketh them too imperious and burdensome.
               They vse the German or Dutch tongue, with a little difference in Dialect; and in some places adjoyning to France, they haue a little smattering of that language.
               The Country lieth exceeding low vpon the Seas, insomuch, that it is much subiect to inundations. In the time of Henry the 2d, Flanders was so ouerflowne, that many thousands of people,

whose dwellings the Sea had deuoured, came into England to beg new seates; and were by that King first placed in Yorkeshire, and then remoued to Pembrookeshire.

He is chosen by the Chapter of S. Lambert, which is the chiefe Church in Leige, or Luyck, the chiefe towne seated on the Meuse. The buildings of this town are very faire, especially the Monasteries and Abbeyes; for which cause it is called the Paradise of Priests.

                  In the skirts of this Countrey, towards France, standeth the Dutchy of Bovillon; the Prince whereof is of the French Nobility & a great assistant to the Protestants: his chief Towns are Sedan & Bouillon. Of these, Bouillon is in the hāds of the Bishop of Leige; to whō

His successours joyntly ruled in both Provinces, the space of 130 yeares: during which time, Luxenbourg was made a Dutchy, by the Emperour Wenceslaus. This mans brother Sigismund, sold it to Antony Duke of Brabant, in respect of a marriage betweene the said Antony, and Elizabeth daughter to Iohn D. of Gorlits, younger brother to this Sigismund. After the death of Duke Antony and his wife, this Dukedome sell to Philip the Good; the Dukes elder brother, and heire.

The causes of the great increase of this towne were three: 1 Two Marts holden here euery yeare, either of them during 6 weekes; in which space no man can either in his person, or his goods, be arrested. 2ly, The King of Portugall hauing in the yeare 1503, diuerted the course of traffique from Alexandria and Venice, to Lisbon: kept here his Factor, and sent hither his spice; for which cause, Anno 1516, many Merchants left Bruges, and dwelt here. 3ly, In the warres betweene the French, and Charles the fift, many Gentlemen and others forsooke the Villages, and built here; so that Antwerpe is since that time bigger then it was, by aboue 3000 houses.
                  These two Provinces were vnited to Lorreine till the dates of Otho the 3d:
                        Munster.
                      who gaue the Dukedome of Brabant to one Conrade, 985, The Marquisate was by the same Otho erected, for the dowre of his aunt Gerberge, mother to Lotharius King of France. How they became vnited, I haue not yet learned. In the yeare 1385, died Iohn D. of Brabant, leauing his estate to his eldest daughter Iane; who dying without issue, gaue this Dutchie to Antony, who was second son of Philip Duke of Burgundie
                     
and to Margaret; danghter vnto Margaret her younger sister. After this Antony, succeeded his two sonnes Iohn and Philip; who quickly dying left their estate to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundie.

The men of the Iland attire themselues in beasts skinnes, and then fall a dancing and leaping; with which sport the fish being delighted, make out of the water toward them. When they haue left the water, there are nets pitched betweene it and them; which done, the men put off their disguizes, and the frighted Fishes hasting

After the establishment of Philip in the gouernment, they to gaine his favour, gaue him 40 millions of Florens: but hee vnseasonably transported with a superstitious zeale, forgot both that, and his fathers Legacie; intangling himselfe and them in a tedious and bloudy war: from which he was compelled to desist with losse of men, mony, and credit. So that now the countrey is diuided betweene the States, and the Archduchesse.

                  The profits which the Arch-Duke reapeth from his part of the country, are not great: his Souldiers pay is great, and hee is loath by taxes and other the like burdens, to exasperat the people, incite them to another rebellion, or startle their resolutions to some farther designes against his quiet.

This not a little grieued the Spaniards, that such base and vnworthy people (for so they esteemed them) should in such liberty possesse so braue and rich a Country; their King bearing no title of maiestie, or absolute command ouer them. Besides the reformation of Religion, which then began to growe to some strength, moued the King to reduce thē by Spanish Rhetoricke (that is by the Sword and the Cannon) to the Romish Church. To these ends hee sent the Duke of Alua, an old and expert Captaine, as hauing 60 yeares beene a Souldier, with a puissant army, to bee his Vice-Roy

At that time the two chiefe men were the Prince of Orange, and Count Egmont; the first was more potent with the people, the latter with the Souldiers. Had these two joyned together, they might easily haue preuented D. Alba's entrance; but Egmont was so soothed vp with letters from Spaine, that he beleeued not the intelligence which the Prince had, concerning the Dukes Commission. The Earle exhorted the Prince to submit himselfe to the pleasure of the King, and so to preuent the ruine of his house: the Prince desired the Earle to maintaine the liberty of his country; as for himself, he had rather bee a Prince without an hous

This was a warre of State, not Religion; the most part of the Hollanders being Papists, at the time of their taking Armes. During these troubles, the Prince of Orenge was not idle; but he in one place, and Count Lodowicke his brother, in another; kept D. Alva imployed: though diuers times not with such fortunate successe, as the cause deserued. In the yeare 1572, Flushing was surprized by Voorst, and Berland, as we haue before said. So also was the Brill in Voorne, an Iland of Holland, by the Count de la March: And not long after, all Holland, except Amsterdam, followed the fortune and side of the Prince, together with all of the Townes of Zealand, Middlebourg excepted.

We may hereby also perceiue what advantages a small State gaineth, by fortifying places and passages:

there being nothing which sooner hindreth a great Prince, then to beleaguer a well fortified towne: for that herein he consumeth his time, and commonly looseth his men, credit, & mony: as the Romanes before Numantia; the great Turke in Malta; and Charles of Burgundy before Nancie. For where warre is drawn out of the field vnto the wals, the Mattock and Spade being more necessary then the Sword and Speare: there the valour of the assailants is little auaileable, because it wanteth its proper obiect.

               The titles of the Fathers descend to all the children, euery son of a Duke, being a Duke; and euery daughter a Dutchesse: a thing which the Italians hold so ridiculous, that they put it in the fore-front of this facetious Satyre. The Dukes and Earles of Germany, the Dons of Spaine, the Monsieurs of France, the Bishops of Italy, the Nobility of Hungary, the Lairdes of Scotland, the Knights of Naples, and the younger brethren of England, make a poore company. For by this common assuming of the Fathers honour, and parting his lands among all the brethren; the Nobility is beyond reason multiplied,

This Swarte was a Franciscan, and studious in Alohymie. For the finding out of experiments in this Art, he was one euening tempering brimstone, dried earth, and certain other ingredients, in a mortar, which he couered with a stone. The night growing on, he took a tinderbox to light him a candle; where striking fire, a spark by chance flew into the mortar, and catching hold of the brimstone, and salt-peter, with great violence blew vp the stone. The cunning Alchymist guessing which of his ingredients it was that produced this effect, made h

are parts of the Empire, but acknowledge no subiection▪ as Denmarke, Switzerland, and the Seuenteene Provinces; Some again acknowledge a kind of subiection, but come not to the Diets, as some Italian Potentates, the Dukes of Lorreine and Savoy; and some both confesse the Emperours soueraigntie, & come to all Councels, namely the Germaine Princes; who all pay certain monies, which they count a contribution, but no tribute. The cities of this country are of 3 sorts, Hansetownes, which enjoy large pr

                  uiledges and immunities,

                   and are in number 72: such are Lubecke, Hambourg, Madenbourg: Each of which is able to put to sea 150 good Ships. The second sort are they which are holden by inheritance of some Princes. The third sort are the Free or Imperiall cities: Free for their great prerogatiues of coyning moneys, and ruling by their owne lawes; Imperiall, as knowing no Lord or protectour, but the Emperour; to whom they pay two third parts of such contributions, as are assessed in the assemblies, and about 1500 Florens yearely, for themselues and their territories. This revenue as it is certainely knowne not to be very great, so cannot wee certainly know how great or litle. These cities enioying so many priuiledges, and hauing so full a command ouer the neighbouring country, and the villages thereof, are exceeding rich & potent. I will instance only in Norimberg, by which wee may guesse at the rest: and in Norimberg also I can but ayme at the whole wealth, by a particular losse, which was thus. Ao 1554. when Maeurice Duke of Saxony,
                  
                     Sleid. Com.
                   and his associats, had driuen the Emperour Charles out of Germany, Albert Marquesse of Brandenbourg, whose sword was in a manner his law, and his revenue, besieged this City: He burnt 100 of the villages belonging to it, 70 manors and sermes appertaining to the citizens: 3000 acres of wood: and after all this spoyle, compoundeth with them for 200000 crownes, and sixe pieces of Ordinance. As for the Religion in these free and Imperiall townes professed, it is in a manner totally the reformed; there being 3 onely, which adhere wholly to the Church of Rome, which are Gmond, Vberlinque, or Whirlingen, and Dinkelspuhel; three smal townes in the lower Suevia, and in some few of the rest, both

religions are permitted. In briefe these are called free Citties (as Guicciardine the Historian defineth them) which acknowledging by a certain determinate tribute, the authority of the Empire, doe notwithstanding in all other things, gouern themselues after their own lawes: not seeking to amplifie their territories, but to defend their liberties. They are in number 60, as Francsort, Norimberg, with the rest: which together with the Princes in time of warres, are to aide the Emperour with 3842 horse, and 16300 foot; but how small a triste is that, in respect of so huge a Country.
               The principall riuers are 1 Danubius, which rising out of Nigrasylva, and receiuing amongst others, 60 navigable riuers, disgorgeth his full stomack out of his 7 mouthes, into the Euxine seas, after it hath streamed along for the space of 1500 miles.

                   (if wee may beleeue what we find recorded) one Teuto the son of Gomer, came into Germany; of whom the people of his posterity were called Teutones: by which name, many of them were known to the Romanes, though not without a miscellaneous admixture of others; as the Cha

                  Romane vntill the dayes of Phocas; when France, Spaine, and Germanie, at a clap shaked off all allegiance to the Empire; so detestable is a tyrannicall vsurper, that euen barbarous and ignoble spirits abhorre his gouernment. Germanie being now slipt from its former bondage, was distracted into many petty royalties; all or most of which, were extinguished by the greater light of the French Monarchie, vnder Pepin and Charles, Kings of France: the latter being for his many seruices to the Church, made Emperour of the West, containing vnder its command, part of Spaine, and Italy, all France, and Germanie, which last hath bin the seat of most of his successours. So that now the prophecie of the Druides, concerning the remouing of the Empire into these parts, seemeth to haue bin fulfilled, though Tacitus in his time accounted it a vaine and idle prediction. For when Civilis raised a rebellion in Germany against Vespasian, then newly made Emperour; possessionem rerum humanarum Transalpinis gentibus portendi, superstitione vanâ Druidae canebant. And by this erecting of the Westerne Empire, we see the prophecie to haue bin good; though it was not so soone fulfilled, as was expected.

The craft of the Popes extended yet farther, euen into Germany; where by granting royall prerogatiues to the tributary Princes, they much weakned the state of the Empire: It was vtterly ruined by Venceslaus, who sold Lombardie to the Visconti of Millaine; and gaue to the Princes many possessions of the Empire, for their fauours in his election; which they then willingly receiued, and since powerfully defended; few of them not being able to wage war

                           ice a helping hand, to driue him out of Germanie. The reason why Charles did institute this Rex Romanorum, was questionlesse a desire to perpetuate the soueraignty in his owne house; but his pretences were 1, because he hauing the command of many Nations, could not alwayes be present in Germany. 2ly the troubled State of Christendome, by reason of Luthers preaching, especially there; 3ly the violent power of the Turkes, who now began to be nigh neighbours vnto them; 4ly the late rurall warres, raised by the Boores, and scarce yet thoroughly extinct; and 5ly an imminent disobedience in euery part of the Empire, seemed to require a powerfull coadjutor. The wise Duke of Saxonie, through all these faire pretences, truely saw the maine plot; which was to make Germany (as Galba in his excellent oration to Piso, said of the Romane Empire) unius quasi familiae haereditatem: and therefore he first flatly denied to yeeld to any such institution. Then he motioned that there might be an acte made, to prohibite the continuance of the Imperiall autority, longer in one family, then for 3 successions: But preuailing in neither, he left the Electours: by whom Ferdinand was chosen, and not long after crowned at Aken or Aquisgrane in Cleueland, the 16 of Ianuary, Anno 1531. This policie hath bin euer since continued by his successours, to which the Germanes are more willing; because the Austrian Princes are natiues of the Country, and able to backe out the Empire, in its compleat countenance of Maiestie.

Nigh vnto this citty did Caesar with incredible expedition make a bridge ouer the Rhene, which more terrified the barbarous enemy, then the reports of his valour; so powerfull is laborious industry, that it ouercommeth all disasters, & maketh the most vnpassable waters, yeeld to Heroicke resolutions. The Archbishop of this citty is the second spirituall Electour of the Emperour, & Chancelour of Italy. In this towne (as it is supposed) are nigh 100 priuate Schooles. In this Towne also are said to lye the bodies of the three wise men, which came from the East to worshippe our Sauiour, vulgarly called the three Kings of Collen. The whole story is at large written in tables, which are fastned vnto the Tombes. The pith whereof is this. The first of them called Melchior, an old man with a long beard, offered gold as vnto a King. The second called Gaspar, a beardlesse young man, offred Frankincense as vnto God▪ The third called Balthasar, a blackmoore with a spreading beard, offred Mirrh, as vnto a man ready for his Sepulchre.

To epitomize the story would quite spoile it, and therefore I referre the reader to the 10th book of Sleidans Commentaries, who excellently, and at large describeth, the beginning, progresse, and end of this fanaticall kingdome.

All these Townes, or at that time rather garrisons, were vnder the command of the captain or Duke of Mentz, to whom the defence of the frontiers was committed. As long as these places were well garrison'd, the Empire continued impregnable on this side: But when Constantine to make resistance against the Persians, transplanted these forces into the East; the barbarous people entring at this gap, quickly defaced and ruin'd the Empire. On the South end of Alsatia stand Colmar, Hagenaw, and Schleistat, or Selestadium, three faire and ancient townes belonging to the Empire.
                  This Country neuer had any peculiar Prince, but alwayes acknowledged the Emperour for their Lord: in the falling of whom, part was seized on by the Duke of Wittenberg, part was alienated to the house of Austria, the rest remaining imperiall.
               
               
                  5. FRANCONIA.
                  FRANKELAND is bounded on the East with Boheme & Saxonie, on the West with Elsas, on the North with Hassia, on the South with Suevia, Bavaria, and Helvetia. The old inhabitants were the Francones. They receiued the Christian faith by the preaching of Boniface (or Winifrede) an Englishman, Anno 730. It is at this day diuided twixt the Palatine of Rhene, the Duke of Wittenberg, the Marquesse of Auspach and Baden, the Bishops of Mentz, Bamberg, Westberg, and the Emperour. It once belonged totally to the Bishops of Westberg, vnto whom it was giuen by Charles the Great, Anno 772. Afterwards Otho the Great invested Conrade,

                     Henry married Agnes his yongest child, to Fredericke Barbarossa: and their issue being extinct by the death of Conrade the fourth, Anno 1254; this Country was diuided betweene the Princes and Prelats aboue-named.
                  1 The PALATINATE of RHENE containeth in length from Coub to Gomersheime, north and South, 72 miles: and in bredth, from Sweibracken to Lauden, East and West, 96 miles. In this compasse are some townes of the Empire, and not a few Lordships belonging to the Bishops of Wormes & Spires two imperiall cities in this Country, and both seated on the Rhine. Spires was formerly called Nemetes, and is sufficiently famous for the imperiall Chamber here continually kept, and that the name of Protestants was first here giuen vnto the Princes and followers of the reformed Religion, 1529. Wormes was of old called Vangionium Speculum. In this towne did Luther make his first appearance before the Emperour Cha

It is the most pleasing and delicious part of all Germany, stored with al fruits and mettals; abounding with those coole wines, and growing on the banks of Rhene, which are by vs called Rhenish wines; adorned with many gallant towns, if we consider either strength or brauery; and finally, watred with the famous riuers of Rhene, and Neccar.

It is now famous for being the seat of the Palsgraues; for the sepulchre of Rodolphus Agricola; and for an Vniversity founded by the Emperour and Palatine Rupertus Anno 1406. On the banks of the Rhene stand 1 Baccharach, so called quasi Bacchiara, for the excellent wines. 2 Coub on the other side of the water; nere vnto which is the old and faire castle called Psalts, from whence the name Psalts-graue or Palsgraue seemeth to haue bin deriued.

WIRTENBERG is about the bignesse of Yorkeshire; the ancient inhabitants were the Tectosages, and Virthungi, from which last, the name of the whole Country is deriued; it hauing bin formerly called Virthunberg. The chief towns are 1 Tubing an Vniuersity. 2 Stutgard the D. seat. 3 Marbach. 4 Caustat: and three Townes of the Empire, Esling, Wiler, and Rutling, all on the riuer Neccar.

                     This Country was made an Earledome in the yeare 1300; in which state it continued, till Earle Eberhard was by the Emperour Maximilian, made D. of Wittenberg in the yeare 1495: in which time, his successours haue added some dominions in Elsas and Suevia; so that his revenues may equall them of the Palatine. His Armes are Or, three attires of a stagge, borne palie barrie; Sable.
                  3. ANSPACH, or Onalsbach is a town of Franconia, distant 5 Dutch, or 25 English miles from Nurenberge. The Marquesse hereof is master of no small part of Franconie: but his estate (as the other Germane Princes are) is mixt and confused, with his neighbours. His chief towns then are 1 Anspach, or Onolsbach, 2 Hailbrun, seated on the edge of Wirtenberge; it was walled Ao 1085; and in it were publique schooles erected by Marquesse George Fredericke, Anno 1582. 3 Pleinfelt not farre from Nurenberge. To this Prince also belongeth a great part of Voiteland,

where he possessed the townes of Culmbach; and 2 Hoffe (formerly called Curia Pegniana) with diuers others.
                  These Marquesses are of the puissant family of Brandenburg,

                      the first which inioyed this title, being M. Fredericke, grandfather to M. Albert, who in the dayes of Charles the 5th, so harassed this country. George the first Marquesse Brandenburg of Iagendorfe, was son vnto this Fredericke: so also was Albert the first Duke of Prussia. The present Marq. Anspach, is Ioachimus Ernestus, youngest brother to the last Electour Sigismund; & was by the Princes of the Vnion, made Generall of their Forces, for the defence of the Palatinate 1620; a charge in which he bare himself, either cowardly, or not faithfully.
                  4. BADEN was made a Marquisate by Frederick Barbarossa. It lieth between the riuers Rhene and Neccar,
                     
                        Munster.
                      and is a fine pleasing and fruitfull place. The first Marquesse was Hermannus, who took to wife Iudith, Countesse of Hochberg in Suevia; by which marriage, many fair possessions accrewed to him in those parts. His successours also had many fair Estates & Lordships in the Palatinate, which the Palatines of the Rhene by litle and litle, haue brought vnder their Dominion. His chief townes are 1 Turlach, or Durlach. 2. Pfortshaimie; and 3 Baden, a proper neat town, seated on the Rhene. Here the D. keepes in the winter, but at sommer he retireth to his fair castle of Milberg. Famous is this town for its hot bathes, being no lesse then 300 in number; from hence the town seemeth to haue tooke denomination, in respect of which, our Bathes in Somersetshire, wer

                      but not comparable to his of Collen. Two of the Moguntine Bishops I cannot omit, the one as infamous for his life, as the other was for his doctrine. The first was Hatto or Hanno, who in a yeare of scarcity, gathered all the poore people in the Country into an olde barne, pretending a generall

almes: but being there, he burnt them all, saying, they were the rats and mice which deuoured the corne: after this inhumane act, he was so haunted with rats and mice, that to auoide them, he built him a palace in the midst of the Rhene, whither also the rats and mice followed and deuoured him. The second was Boniface, who was the first that taught, that though the Pope neglected all Christianity, yet ought no man to rebuke him for it. It seemeth that this Boniface was a sound in Philosophy, as Religion; for hapning to see a Tractate written by Virgilius Bishop of Salizburge; of the Antipodes; and supposing that vnder that strange name some damnable doctrine was conteined; made complaint first to the D. of Boh

Into this league entred Charles the Emperour, Fernando king of the Romanes; the Bishops of Mentz, and Salisburg; William & Lewis Dukes of Bavaria, Henry Duke of Brunswicke, and George Duke of Saxony. Keckerman reporteth that at the comming of Maximilian, the Emperour toward this Towne; a wooden Eagle made by an Artizan here dwelling, flew a quarter of a mile out of the town to meet the Emperour: and being come to the place where hee was, turned backe againe of her owne accord, and accompanied him home to his lodging.

But herein they fell out of the fryingpanne into the fire: for Ferdinand King of the Romanes then Archduke, being possessed of the Towne; ceazed on the common treasurie, and all the writings belonging to the Towne; he commanded that no Cittizen should weare a sword, and that within eight dayes all the Ministers of the Gospell should depart the Citty.

                     Zwitzerland in Caesars time was so populous, that the Countrey not being able to sustaine the people, they set fire on their Townes and houses, and went all with a generall resolution to seeke new dwellings. The men, women, and children amounted to the number of 3680000: which notwithstanding were by Caesar compelled to returne into their pristine habitation. During the Empire of the French, they were accounted French;
                        Munster.
                      and Germane, when the Empire was devolved vnto Germanie. But being at last ouer-burdened with the tyranny of their Gouernours; and seeing the Empire by the

Popes Fulminations, distracted into diuers factions; they contracted an offensiue and defensiue league: into which first entred the Vranians, Swits, and Vndervaldens, Ao 1316; neither were they all vnited into one consederation till the yeare 1513. At their first beginning to free themselues from bondage, Fredericke Duke of Austria, sent his sonne Leopold to war vpon them; but they protesting that they neuer acknowledged the Dukes of Austria for their Lords, but only such of this family as were Emperours; encountred and ouerthrew him, more by the convenience of the narrow passages, through which his army was to passe,
                        Cominaus.
                      then their own valour. The first time that euer they got any reputation by their valour, was in the warres which Charles Duke of Burgundy made against them; when they discomfited in three set battailes: a warre begun on very small occasions, and lesse hopes: the country being so barren, & the people so poore, that their Embassadour to the Duke protested, that if all his countrimen were taken, they would not be able to pay a ransome, to the value of the spurres and bridle bits in his campe. Certainly at that time they were so poore, that they knew not what riches was; for hauing wonne the first battaile at Granson, (the other two were those of Morat and Nancie) one of the goodliest pauilions in the world, was by them torne into peeces, and turned into breeches and sidecoats: diuerse siluer plates and dishes they sold for two souse apeece, supposing them to be powter; and a great Diamond of the Dukes, which was the goodliest Iewell in Christendome, was sold to a Priest for a guilder; and by him again to some of the Lords of the country for three franks. After their valour shewed in those battailes, Lewis 11th took them into pension, giuing them yearely 40000 Crownes, viz: 20000 to the cities, and 20000 to particular persons. These pensions, when by their assistance Lewis 12th had conquered Millaine, they desired to haue enlarged, which when he denied, they with-drew themselues from the amity of the French, and entred into the seruice of Pope Iulio 2d;
                        Guicciard.
                      who therefore stiled them the Defenders of the Church, Anno 1510. Francis, successour to this Lewis, considering what damage his Realme had sustained by the revolt

of these auxiliaries to his enemies, renewed the confederation with them, on condition that he should restore the ancient pension of 40000 Crownes: secondly, that he should pay vnto them at certaine termes, 600000 Crownes: thirdly, that hee should entertain 4000 of them in his pay continually: fourthly that for the restoring of such places as they had taken from the Dutchy of Millaine, he should giue vnto thē 300000 crowns: fiftly, that he should giue them three months pay before-hand: sixtly and lastly, that Maximilian Sforce, whom they had estated in Millaine, and were now going to dispossesse; might by the King be created Duke of Nemours, endowed with 12000 frankes of yearely revenue, and married to a Lady of the blood royall. On these conditions, as honourable to them, as burdensome to the King, was the league renued Anno 1522: since which time, they haue obtained, that 600 of their Countrie are to be of the French Kings guard; 500 of which, waite without at the gates of the Court, the other hundred in the great hall.
                  As for the Religion of this people, they are diuided into Papists and Protestants; fiue Cantons being wholly Papists; viz: Swits,

But in the yeare 1531, an absolute peace was concluded between them, so that notwithstanding this diuersity of Religion, they liue now in a happy vnity, gouerning after a Democraticall for me. The country is in length 240, and in bredth 180 miles; and is thought to containe three millions of people.

The whole Region is diuided into three confederations. 1 Lega Cadi Deo, whose chiefe City is Chur or Coyra, on which, as being the Metropolis of the Grisons, I will the longer insist. It was built Anno 357, seated about halfe an houres journey from the Rhene: for forme it is triangular, the houses indifferent hansome in themselues, but not vniforme one with the other. In one corner of it, on a hill somewhat higher then the rest of the towne, standeth the close, within which is the Cathedrall Church; a stately piece of building, rather in the account of the natiues, then strangers; the Bishops palace, and the Canons houses, all well built, and sufficiently adorned. This Town, together with all the rest of the Country in 2 manner, was taken by the Spaniard, Anno 1622. This Liga Cadi Dio comprehendeth 21 corporations, and sendeth to the generall Senates 23 Commissioners. The 2 is Lega Grisa, whence all the people are called Grisons: It sendeth to the Senates 28 Deputies, & comprehendeth 19 Commonalties; the chiefe of which is Musocco. The 3d is Lega Dritture, containing 10 Corporations, the chief Townes of which are Bormio and Sondrio; and sendeth to the Senatehouse 14 Commissioners. The gouernment of this Country was giuen Anno 744, by Charles the great, to `the Bishop of Coyra, who being molested by his neighbours of Tirolis, entered confederation with the Switzers, 1471. They haue free vse of Religion, both they of the Romish, as they of the Reformed Church.
                  Lower SVEVIA, or the country now called the Dukedome SCHWABEN; is limited on the East with Bavaria, on the West with Danubius, on the North with Francoma, and on the South with Tirolis and the Grisons. The chiefe Townes are 1 Vlme, so called for the company of Elmes which inviron it. 2 Lind

                  The former inhabitants were the Rhaeti, and the Vindelici; these latter, if I coniecture not amisse, deriuing their name from the riuer Lycus, which bounded the East side of their country. They were both bitter enemies to the Romans, on whom they executed all manner of crueltie, that a barbarous rage could invent. To represse these insolencies, Augustus sent against them his sonne-in-law Drusus, being the father of Germanicus, who subdued them: but not without great resistance: the women throwing their young children at the Romans, insteed of darts.

After his death, the issue of the former Dukes fayling, Rodolphus Haspergensis seized on the greatest part of this Countrey, for Austria & the Empire: the rest was shared, though not equally, betweene the Dukes of Bavaria, and Wittenberg.

It is bounded East and North with Bohemia; West with that part of Franconie, which belongeth to the citty of Nurenberge; and South with Danubius. It belongeth totally to the Palatines of the Rhene, and so hath done euer since the yeare 1339: when Lodovicus the Emperour, and and first Duke of Baniere, after the diuision aboue-mentioned made between him and Rodolphus the Palatine; gaue it for euer

It is seated on the Danubius, & is doubtlesse one of the brauest and beautifullest Townes in Germanie: adorned with many magnificent Temples, and stately Monasteries; but aboue all, with a most sumptuous and princely Palace, wherein the Archdukes keep their residence, built by Ottocarus King of Bohemia, during the little time that he was Duke here. This town was anciently called Fabiana, but being ruined by the Hunnes, and again by the natiues reedified, obtained this new name. 2 Emps so called of the riuer Ems, on whose banks it is seated. 3 S.

                     Austria was formerly called Pannonia superior; and afterward being subiected to the French Monarchie, was called Ostenrich or Austrich. It was wrested from the Empire, during the raigne of Arnulphus, by the Hunnes; from whom it was recouered by Otho the first, with the aid of many Nobles, amōgst whom the Country was distributed; which Families being extinct, Otho the II gaue the Prouince to a yong Gentleman called Lupoldus, with the title of Marquesse, Anno 980. This Marquisate was by Fredericke Barbarossa raised to a Dukedome, 1158, Henry being the first Duke, whose brother Leopold, took Richard the first of England, prisoner, in his returne from Palestine: for whose ransome he had so much money, that with it he bought Carniola, the Counties of Neobourgh, and Luitz; & walled Vienna. His son Fredericus Leopoldus was for his manifold deserts, made King of Austria, by the Emperour Frederick the second, Anno 1225. Eleuen yeares he continued in this dignity; at the end of which, he was spoyled of his royal ornaments by the same Emperour, for patronage of villainous actions in his kingdome, and scorning to appeare to his answere at the

summons of the Emperour. Finally, he died in the yeare 1246, leauing two daughters. His sister named Margaret was

The effects of this Councell I cannot better describe, then in the words of the history hereof, which are these: This Councell desired and procured by godly men, to re-vnite the Church, which began to be diuided; hath so established the schisme, and made the parties so obstinate, that the dis

Before this time also the workes of Wickliffe were brought into Bohemia, by a certain scholler who had beene a student in the Vniuersity of Oxford, which happening into the hands of Iohn Husse, and Hierome of Prague, two men whereof the Country may worthily boast; wrought in their hearts a desire to reforme the Church: a businesse which they prosecuted so earnestly, that being summoned to the councell of Constance, they were there condemned for hereticks, and burned, Anno 1414. yet had their doctrine such deep root in the Bohemians, that it could neuer by warre or persecution be plucked vp; but to this day continueth, though abundantly perfected by the writings of Luther, Calvin, and other painful labourers in Gods Haruest.

It consisteth of foure seuerall Townes, euery of which hath its peculiar Magistrates, lawes, and customes. The principal is called the old town, adorned with many goodly edifices, a spacious market place, and a stately Senate house. The second is called the new Towne separated from the old by a ditch of great depth and widenesse. The third called the little towne, is diuided from the old towne by the riuer Mulda, and ioyned to it by a beautifull bridge, consisting of 24 arches; and in this towne is the hill Rachine, on the sides whereof are many fayre and stately houses belonging to the nobility; and on the toppe thereof a magnificent pallace, wherein the Bohemian kings, and the latter Emperours, kept their residence. The fourth Towne is that of the Iewes, who haue here fiue Synagogues, and liue according to their owne particular lawes and liberties. Neere vnto this Towne was fought that memorable battaile betweene the Duke of Bavaria and Count Bucquoy, Leistenants for the Emperour Ferdinand, with 50000 men on the one side; and Fredericke newly elected king of Bohemia, with the Prince of Anhalt, the Count of Thurne, & 30000 men on the other side. It was fought on the eight of Nouember stylo nouo being Sunday; wherein (such was the vnsearchable will of God) the victory fell vnto the Imperialls, the yong Princes of Anhal

                     The Marquisate of BRANDENBOVRG is limited on the East with Poland, on the West with Saxony, on the North with Pomerania, on the South with Lusatia: it is in compasse 520 miles, in which are contained 50 Citties, and 64 walled towns, the chiefe of which are 1 Brandenbourg, built by Brando a Prince of the Franconians, Anno 140. 2 Francofurt (for distinction sake named) ad Oderam, which was made an Vniuersity by Ioachim the Marquesse 1506. It is situate in a soyle so plentifully stored with Corne and Wines, that it is not easie to affirme whether Ceres or Bacchus be most enamoured of it.

                      Here is also at this Towne a famous Empory, but not comparable to that of the other Francfort on the Moenus. 3 Berlin, the ordinary residence of the Marquesse. It is situate on the riuer Spre, a riuer which arising in Lusatia, emptieth it selfe into the Albis; 4 Hauelbourg, seated on the little riuer Havell, the seat of a Bishop, who acknowledgeth the Archbishop of Maydenbourg for his Metropolitan. This Marquisate is diuided into the new and the old; the river Odera watering the last; the Albis the first.
                  
                     Brandenbourg was taken from the Frankes and Vandalls, by the Emperour Henry the first,

This Henry gaue the Country of Brandenbourg with the title of Marquesse, to one Earle Albert: whose issue being extinct, Lodovic: Bavarus gaue this Marquisate to his sonne Ladowicke, Ann. 1314. His grandchild Otho, sold it vnto Procopius Marquesse of Moravia, Ao 1373: whose issue failing, it was giuen to Fredericke the Burgraue of Neurenberge, Anno 1417, by the Emperour Sigismund. The posterity of this Fredericke to this day inioy it, possessing also part of Prussia; and the three Dukedomes of Cleus, Iuliers, and Berge, or Montz, the Signiories of Prignits, and Crossen, the confines of Silesia, and this Marquisate; together with the coū

and multitude of subiects; but fall short of them in the largenesse of their revenew. This augmentation of their Dominions is of no great standing; Prussia was estated on M. Albert, Anno 1525, and by a marriage betweene Anne the Neice and heire of this Albert, and Sigismund the late Electour, is newly added to the Electorall family.

And 3ly, Iohannes Georgius of Iagendorfe, brother to the last Electour, who hauing faire possessions in Silesia, and furthering the election of his Cosen the Palatine of Rhene, to the Crowne of Bohemia: is dispossessed of his estates, and proscribed by the now preuailing Emperour; whom hee ceaseth not most couragiously with all his force and pollicy continually to disturbe.

Not much aboue tenne miles from Lubecke, is Hamborough, in which Towne are 777 Brewers, one Lawyer, one Phisician, & 40 Bakers. The reason why there is such an huge disproportion betweene the number of Brewers, and that of Lawyers and Physicians; is, because a cuppe of nimis is their best vomiting potion; & their differences are sooner decided ouer a Canne, then by course of law. Not far hence but on the other side of the riuer is Stoade, where the English men haue a house to sell abroad their cloathes and other commodities.

                     4 SAXONY is on the North of Turinge & Misnia; her chiefe Towne is Parthenopolis now Meydenberg, or Magdeberg, which belonged to the Empire; but now is vnder the patronage of the Dukes of Saxonie. For when this Town refusing to receaue the Interim, was outlawd by the Emperour, and giuen to him that could first take it; it was attempted by the Duke of Megelberg; but he was in a Camisado taken prisoner, his Army routed, his Nobles made captiue, and 260 horses brought into the Citty. Next it was besieged by Duke Maurice, who on honourable tearmes was after a long siege receaued into it; Ao 1550, when it had stood on its owne guard the space of 3 yeares. This long opposition of one Towne, taught the Germane Princes what constancie could doe; it held vp the coales of rebellion in Germanie; and indeed proued to be the fire which burned the Emperours trophies. For here Duke Maurice comming acquainted with Baron Hedecke, hatched that confederacie, by which not long after this great Emperour was driuen out of Germany. 2 Worlits seated on the Albis. 3 Heldericke. 4 Wittenberg, the seat of the electours of Saxonie, and an Vniuersity of Diuines, founded by Duke Fredericke, Anno 1508.

Famous is this town for the Sepulchres of Luther and Melancthon; but chiefely for that here were the walls of Popery broken downe, & the Gospell of Christ reduced to perfection. The whole story in briefe is this.
                  
                     Luther was borne at Isleben in Sax. and studied first at Magdeburg; but at the establishing of the Vniuersity of Witte

                        berg, he was chosen to prosesse there. It hapned in the yeare 1516, that Pope Leo hauing need of money, sent about his Iubiles and Pardons: against the abuses of which, Luther inueighed both priuatly and publikely, by word and writing. This spark grew at last to so great a coale, that it fired the Papall Monarchy; for the Germane Princes cleaued to the doctrine of Luther, & protested they would defend it to the death: hence were they first called Protestants. Yet was not this reformation so easily established. Christ had foretold that fathers should be against their

sonnes, and brothers against brothers for his sake; neither doe we euer finde in any story, that the true religion was induced or religion corrupted about to be amended, without warre and bloudshed. Charles the Emperour whetted on by the Romane Bishops, had long borne a grudge against the reformation; but especially against the confederacy of Smalc

                        ld. After long heart burnings on either side, they brake out at last into open warre, which at first succeeded luckily with the Princes. But there being an equality of command, betweene Iohn Fredericke the Electour, and Philip the Lantgraue; one sometimes not approuing, otherwhiles thwarting the others proiects: the ende prooued not answerable. Besides the politique Emperour alwaies eschewed all occasion of battaile; and by this delaye wearied out this Armie of the Princes; which without performing any notable exploit, disbanded it selfe: Euery man hastning home to defend his owne. The Duke of Saxonie had most cause to hast
                        •
                     n homeward; for in his absence, his cousin Maurice forgetting the education he had vnder him, and how formerly the Duke had conquered for him, and estated him in the Prouince of Misnia; combined himself with the Emperour, and invaded his Vncles Country. But the Duke Electour, not only recouered his own, but subdued all the Estates in which he had formerly placed his vngratefull and ambitious kinsman. The Emperour all this while was not idle, but waited advantage to encounter the Duke, which at last he found righ vnto Mulberg, where the Duke was hearing a Sermon. The Emperour giueth the alarum: the Duke startled from his religious exercise, seeketh to order his men: but in vaine. For they supposing the Emperour to be neerer with all his Forces, then indeed he was; add the wings of feare, to the feet of cowardice, and flie away; yet did the Duke with a few resolute Gentlemen as well as they could, make head against the enemie; till most of them were slaine, and the Duke himself taken prisoner. The morrow after this ouerthrow, he was condemned to loose his head, but pardoned he was at last, on condition he should ransomlesse set free Marquesse Albertus, renounce his dignity of the Electourship; resigne vp al his

inheritances, with the like harsh Articles. It was also vrged that he should alter his religiō; but that he so constantly denied that it was om

After this victory, the Emperour fraudulently intrapped the Lantgraue; then marched he against the cities, in all which he prevailed, restored the Masse, and draue them to hard composit

                     eces of Ordinance. The imprisonment of the Lantgraue, contrary to the Emperors promise, was the chief thing which ouerthrew his good fortune For Duke Maurice hauing pawned his word, and giuen vnto the Lantgraues children his bond, for the safe returne of their Father, found himself much wronged and grieued. Therfore consulting with Baron Hedeck, he entreth league with the French King, associateth himself with Marquesse Albert, suddenly surpriseth Auspurg, and by the terrour which his haste brought with it, forced the Emperour to flye from Inspruch, & the Fathers to break vp the Councell of Trent. The Emperour now brought low, easily hearkned to an honourable composition, which not long after was concluded; the Cities recouering their priuiledges; free passage being giuen to the Gospell; and all things being reduced to the same state they were in before the warres; the restoring of Iohn Fredericke to his Dukedome and Electourship, only excepted. So did this Duke Maurice both ouerthrow the liberty of his country, and restore it; so was the preaching of the Gospell by his meanes depressed, by the same again reviued, and established stronger then euer. Thus we see

But God grant that their hopes may be frustrated, & we will say with the Poet,

                        —Hae manus Troiam origent?

He demaunded what she carried in her lap, she answered, puppies: he desired to see them, she denied him. The Lord on this growing angry, opened her apron, & there sound eleuen of his own sonnes, pretty sweet babes, and of most promising countenances. The Earle examined the matter, found out the truth; inioyned the old trot to be secret, and put the children to a miller to nurse. Six yeares being passed ouer in silence, the Earle making a solemne feast, invited most of his wiues and his own friends. The yong boyes he attireth all in the same fashion, and presenteth them to their mother: she misdoubting the truth, confesseth her fault, is by the Earle pardoned, and acknowledgeth her children From Welfus the eldest of these brethren, descended Earle Henry, son and heire to the Lady Luitgardis Queene of the Franks and Bavarians. His posterity held Bavaria 109 yeares. Afterward they came to be Dukes of Saxony, vnder whose command & Empire, Brunswick & Lunebourg once were;

                      till Duke Henry called the Lyon, was proscribed by the Emperour Fredericke Barbarossa, and disinherited both from Brunswicke & Saxonie. At last his grand-child Otho got by his submission, the Dukedome of Brunswicke, together with the title of Lunebourg, by the grant of Fredericke the second. This Otho died 1252: whose posterity injoyed these Dukedomes joyntlie, till the yeare 1430; in which the Country was diuided between William the Victorious, who had the title of Brunswicke: and his Vncle Bernard who had the title of Lunebourg. In their posterity both these Dukedomes still remain, though Brunswicke be the greater.

a great part of their Country compelled them to seeke new seates; whereupon in great multitudes abandoning their dwellings, they petitioned the Romans, then lording it ouer a great part of the world, for some place to settle in. This request being denied, they proceeded in an other manner, winning with their swords, what their tongues could not obtain. Manilius, Sillanus, and Cepio, all Roman Consuls, perished by them; so that now (saith Florus) actum esset de imperio Romano, nisi illi seculo Marius contigisset; for he, as we haue elsewhere told you, vtterly ouerthrew them. The next inhabiters hereof were the Saxons, of whom we haue already spoken; and as for the Danes they were a people inhabiting the Ilands of Sinus Codanus, who about the yeare 500,

Of late they haue had no warres but with the Swethlanders, to whose kingdome they pretend a title from their Q. Margaret; who vanquished Albertus the King of Swethland, and gouerned it: as also did many of her successours, as shall be shewed in the Catalogue of the Swethland Kings. I will now reckon vp such Kings of the Danes, as haue bin since Charles the Great, the former of which were in number 44, hauing no certainty or apparance of continuance.

They deuoure like the Locusts euery green thing on the earth, and at a certain time die all in heapes (as it were) together: and with their stench so poison the aire, that the poore people are long after troubled with the Iaundies, and with a giddinesse in the head. But these beasts come not often.

They were once famous warriers, they conquered Neustria in France, since called Normandy, vnder the conduct of Rollo; England vnder the leading of D.

               Townes here are exceeding thinne, and in them the houses very miserable and poore; for the most part patched vp of durt and hurdles, not much vnlike our ordinary village-houses in Lincolneshire, The chief of these towns are 1 Nidrosia, the See of an Archbishop, who is the Metropolitan of Norwey, Island, and Groinland. 2 Bergen, one of the foure ancient mart-townes of Europe; the other three being London in England, Novigrod in Muscovie, and Bruges in Flanders. But of these, three are decayed, viz: this Bergen, which hath yeelded to Wardhuis; Novigrod which by reason of the change of navigation through the Balticke, into the Northerne passage, hath giuen way to S. Nicholas: and Bruges which was depriued of her traffick by Antwerpe, from whence it is remoued to Amsterdam: For the Hollanders by blocking vp the hauen; but especially by keeping Bergen aep Zome, haue such a command ouer the riuer; that no vessell can passe or repasse without their licence. 3 Asloya, a Bishops See, and the place in which Iustice is administred for all the kingdome: and 4 Staffanger.

and 3 Wardhuis seated in the very Northerne end of all the Country; a towne very profitable and seruiceable to the King, in that it a weth the Lappians, who border on this Prouince: and because ships must of necessity touch at it in their passage to Muscouie. It is so called, for that it standeth in a little Iland called Warde.

The Christian Faith was first preached here by the meanes of Pope Adrian the fourth. They followed the reformed Church after the opinions of Luther; and speake the Dutch language; which is also common to their Lords of Denmarke, and neighbours of Sweden.

               OF SWETHLAND.
               SWETHLAND is bounded on the East with Muscouie, on the West with the Dofrine hils, on the North with the Frozen Seas, on the South with the Balticke seas. These Balticke Seas are they which beginning at the narrow passage, called the Sound, interlace the countries of Denmarke, Swethlaud, Germany, and Poland, and extend euen to Livonia and Lituania. These Seas are by some called Mare Su

                     vicum; by Pomponius Mela, Sinus Codanus; by Strabo, Sinus Venedicus: but generally Mare Balticum, because the great Peninsula of Scandia was called Baltia. The reasons why this sea being so large, doth not ebb & flow, are 1 the narrownesse of the streight by which the Ocean is let unto it; and secondly the Northerne situation of it, whereby the celestial influences produce therein the lesser operation.

               The soyle is so fertill, that to see a bigger is a difficult matter; and the aire so healthfull, that it is ordinary to see men of 130, or 140 yeares of age. The country aboundeth with Mines of Lead, Copper, and Siluer, which are transported into other Nations, together with hides of Bucks, Goates, and Oxen, Tallow, Tarre, Barley, Malt, costly Furres, and the like.

They are of an indifferent good stature, and passing well skilled in Archerie.

Phritigernes being ouerthrowne fled to Valens, and of him receaued such succours, that encountering againe his enimy, he wonne the day; & to gratifie the Emperour (who mainely was addicted to Arrianisme) he commanded his subiects to embrace that doctrine. Vliphas, Bishop of the Gothes, at the same time inuented the Gothicke letters, and translated the holy Scriptures into that language: Which labor the good old man might wel haue spared,

But this is not altogether in my conceit so likely; for in fatali illa gentium emigratione, when almost all nations shifted their seats; these Sueui retired partly into Swaben, and the rest into Spaine, as we haue there said: of any expedition of theirs into this Country negry quidem, wee read not a word. Mine owne opinion (if it be lawfull for me to insert mine owne) is twofold: First, I referre their originall to the Suiones mentioned by Tacitus, and by him reputed to be strong in men, armour, and shipping. That these Suiones were inhabiters of Scandia, appeareth by two circumstances of the same author; viz: I that the people were not permitted to weare weapons, quia subitos hostium incursus prohibet Oce

by the names of Sueones or Sueci are they called both in Munster and Crantzius abouenamed. My second derivation is from the Suethans and Suethidi, mentioned by Iornandes, and by him placed in the Ile of Scanzia; for such, by old writers, was this great Peninsula esteemed to be. Now that these are the Suecians or Swethlanders, appeareth first by the propinquitie of the names. 2ly, In that he maketh the Finlanders or Finni and Finnauhae to be their neere neighbours: and 3ly, in that by the same author they are affirmed to haue furnished the Romanes with rich Furres, and the skinnes of wild beasts; with which commodities this countrey is abundantly stored. To which of these opinions to adhere, I am not yet resolute: what now, if I should say that these Sueones and Suethans, were but one people, & to haue had these diuers names according to the diuerse ages of Authors? If I did, it were but my guesse; and sometimes better men coniecture as improbably.

                  The men of warre are more obedient to their Prince then any Northerne Souldiers whatsoeuer, because the King giueth vnto every souldier victuals, and that according to their obedience and desert: 2 If a Souldier be taken by the enimy the King doth vsually redeeme him: 3 If a Souldiers horse bee slaine vnder him, the King most graciously giueth him another.

This Country standeth partly in Europe, partly in Asia. It taketh its name from Musco, the chiefe Citty; and is also called Russia alba, to distinguish it from Russia nigra, a province of Poland. The reason whereof, saith one, speaking of the Muscovite, is, quod incolae omnium regionum ipsius imperio subiectarum, vestibus albis & pileis plerun

The Commons liue in miserable subiection to the Nobles; and they againe in as great slauery to the Duke or Emperour: to whom no man dareth immediatly exhibit a petition, or make known his grieuances: nay the meaner Lords are squeamish in this kind, and but on great submission will not commend vnto the Duke a poore mans cause. They are altogether vnlearned; euen the Priests are meanely indoctrinated; it being cautionated by the great Duke that there be no Schooles, lest there should be any Schollers but himsel

The women are private fearefull to offend, but once lasciuious, intollerably wanton. It is the fashion of these women to loue that husband best which beateth them most; and to thinke themselues neither loved nor regarded, vnlesse they be twice or thrice aday welfauoredly swadled. The author of the Treasurie of times, telleth a story of a German Shoomaker, who trauelling into this Country, and here marrying a widdow, vsed her with all kindnes that a woman could (as he thought) desire; yet did not she seem contented.

At last learning where the fault was, & that his not beating her, was the cause of her pensiuenesse; he took such a vaine in cudgelling her sides, that in the end the hangman was fain to breake his necke for his labour.
               They vse the Sclauonian language, and receaued the Christian saith Anno 987: in which they follow the Church of Greece, and differ from the Romish and reformed Churches: 1 Denying the holy Ghost to proceed from the Father, and the Sonne. 2ly, Denying Purgatory, but praying for the dead. 3ly, Beleeuing that holy men inioy not the presence of God, before the resurrection. 4ly, Communicating in both kindes; but vsing leauened bread, and mingling warme water with wine: which both together they distribute with a spoone. 5ly, Receauing Children of seauen yeares old to the Sacrament, because then they begin to sin

                  e. 6ly, For bidding extreame vnction, confirmation, and fourth marriages. 7ly, Admitting none to orders but such as are married; and prohibiting marriage to them who are actually in orders. 8ly, Reiecting carued Images, but admitting the painted 9ly, Obseruing foure Lents in the yeare. 10ly, Reputing it vnlawfull to fast on Saturdaies. This diversity betweene the Romanists and this people in points of religion; hath bred such a difference betweene them in loue, and made the one so hard cō

               In matters of warre the people are indifferently able,

                   as being almost in continuall broyles with their neighbours; & haue a custome that when they goe to the warres, euery Souldier giueth vnto the Emperour a peece of money; which after the end of the warres, he againe receaueth of him: by which meanes the number of the slaine is exactly knowne. At their funeralls they vse to put a penny in the mouth of the deceased, a paire of shoes on his feet, and a letter in his hand directed (such is their superstition) to St 
                  Nicholas, whom they deeme to bee the porter of heauen: an opinion doubtlesse very preiudiciall to the Popes,

and St 
                  Peters prerogatiues.
               This Country is not so populous as spacious, the Easterne parts are vexed with the Tartars, who like Aesops dogge will neither dwel there themselues, nor suffer the Muscovite to plant Colonies there: the Westerne parts are almost as much molested by the Sweden & Polonian Kings: the Southern by the Turks and Precopenfes: & the Northerne by the coldnesse of the aire; which is of such vehemency; that water throwne vp into the ayre, will turne to ice before it fall to the ground. The better to resist this extremity of this cold, not onely the cloathes of this people, but their very houses are lined with thicke furres. Every Gentleman or man of note hath in his dwelling house a Stoue, or hot-house; in which they keepe, as it were, to thaw themselues. Such as trauell on the way, vse often to rub their nose & eares with snowe or ice, to settle and recall the motiue spirits into these parts; which otherwise they would bee in a danger to loose: the ignorance of which preventing chirurgery, was not the least cause that in the yeare 1598, of 70000 Tu

                     kes, which made an intode into Muscovie, 40000 were frozen to death. This excesse of cold in the ayre, gaue occasion to Castilian in his Aulicus, wittily and not incongruously to faine, that if two men being somewhat distant talke together in the winter, their words will be so frozen that they cannot bee heard; but if the parties in the spring returne to the same place, their words will melt in the same order that they were frozen and spoken, & bee plainely vnderstood. Such is their Winter, neither is their Summer lesse miraculous. For the huge seas of Ice, which in a manner couered the whole surface of the Countrey, are at the first approach of the Sunne suddainly dissolued, the waters quickly dryed vp, and the earth dressed in her holyday apparell, such a mature growth of fruits, such flourishing of hearbs, such chirping of birds, as if

                  ere were a perpetuall spring.
               The chiefe commodities which they send abroad, are rich Furres; others of lesse note are Flaxe, Hemp, Whales grease, hony, Wax, Canvasses, Nuts, and the like.
               The revenues of this Empire cannot but be great, the Great Duke being Lord both of the liues and goods of his Subiects:

                  Mahomet a Turkish Bashaw was wont to say, that his master & the Muscovite were the most absolute Princes in the world. His revenewes in mony (his houshold charge being defrayed) amount to 3 Millions of Rubbles. He is apparelled like a King and a Bishop; wearing with his royall vestiment a Miter and a Crosier staffe. When he sitteth in his state, all the plate of his house is set before him; with a great number of the grauest and seemliest men of all Musco, and the adioyning Citties richly apparelled out of the wardrope:
                     Archb. Ab.
                   which to Forreiners, not knowing this cunning fraud, appeare so many Princes & Noble men; and is no small cause of admiration and wonder at his magnificence.
               The Country may bee (as rightly it is) called the Mother of Rivers; the chiefe of which are Don or Tanais, which was by the ancient Geographers, thought to bee the onely bound twixt Europe and Asia: it disburdeneth it selfe into Palus Maeotis, 2 Duina, which entreth into the Scythian Seas, at the Abbie of St 
                  Nicholas; where the English since the discouery of the Northerne passage, vse to land; and disperse themselues into all the parts of this vast Empire. And truly there is no nation so kindly entertained amongst the Russians both Prince and people, as the English; who haue many immunities not granted to other nations. The cause I cannot but attribute to the neuer-dying fame of our late Queene, admired and loued of the Barbarians; and also to the conformable behauiour of the English in generall; which is so accepted, that when Wasiliwich or Basiliades nayl'd the hat of an other forraine Embassadour to his head for his peremptorinesse: hee at the same time, vsed our S•

               The revenues of the kingdome are about 600000 crownes, most of which are put vp in his Treasury: For the Kingdome is diuided into 4 parts, euery part of it keeping the King and his Court, in allowance and all expences a quarter of a yeare: and contributing money to the marriages of his daughters.
               The chief riuers are Vistula, which hath its fountaine in the Carpathian mountaines, which part Hungary from Poland; his mouth is in the Balticke sea▪ and is navigable 400 miles. 2 Neister, which parteth it from Moldavia. 3 Neiper. 4 Ruben. 5 Beg. 6.

                        Munster
                      on the North with Finland; and on the South with Lituania. It is in length 500, in bredth 160 miles, and is a country exceeding mountainous and fennie; yet withall so abundantly fruitfull, that no small store of prouision is sent hence into other countries. The people receiued the Christian Faith partly by the preaching of one Meinardus, Ao 1200: and partly by the compelling of the Knights, called the Enfifers, or of the Portglaiue, who seconded the good beginnings of that reuerend man. The chiefe townes are 1 Riga an Archbishops See. 2 Derpt, a town of great commerce. 3 Rivallia a strong fort in the hands of the Swe

They vse here to be diuorced and remarried as often as they list. For a man to vse the bed or body of an harlot, is counted a most opprobrious crime: but for a woman to haue her stallions, is so frequent and vnblameable, that the husbands call them Connubij adiutores, or their fellow-labourers, and prize them far aboue all the rest of their acquaintance.
                  3 VOLINIA is environed with Lituania, Podolia, and Russia; the people are strong and warlike. It hath as chief townes in it Kiovia, and Circassia, on the banks of the riuer Neiper, and is a small woodie Prouince.

It hath the attribute of Nigra, to distinguish it from Muscouia, which is Russia Alba; and was formerly called Ruthenia and Roxolania. It is also called Russia Meridionalis, and is a very fruitfull Country, well stoared with faire horses, and numerous heards of cattell.

They continued long in warres with the Prussians themselues, whom they found to be tough meat, and neither easily chewed, nor quickly disgested. Hauing made an end with thē, they were assaulted by the Polanders, vnto whose King Casimire, they were compelied to become tributary, Ao 1450, Lodovicus being the present, and from Henry Walpat the 18th Master. Yet was not Lodovicus easily vanquished, he hauiug formerly driuen the King out of the field, routed his whole Army, slaine 3000 of his men, and taken 136 of his Nobility. Neither was he now ouercome but by the rebellion of his own people. Finally, peace was made between the Prussians and Poles, conditionally that the King of Poland should haue Dantzicke, & the Westerne parts; and that Albert the Marquesse of Brandenbourg, and then Master of the order, should possesse Regimount with the title of Duke; and should doe homage for it to the Polonian, taking in all assemblies his place at the kings right hand.

                     The Marian or Dutch knights, instituted vnder the walls of

                     Acon, Ao 1190; Their first master being Henry Walpot. They took their first name from S. Maries Church at Acon, when their order was allowed; and their second when they had conquered Prussia. Their Ensigne was a black Crosse. The 34 Master of the order was Albert, Marquesse of Brandenbourg, who revolting from Sigismund King of Poland, to whose Predecessour Casimire, the Knights had submitted themselues, drew on the Country a long and miserable warre 1511. Hauing for 14 yeares valiantly maintained the liberty of the Country, and the credit of the order; and in vaine for 4 yeares together importuned the assistance of the Emperour and Princes of Germanie: he casteth the order, and is by King Sigismund made D. of Prussia, for him and his heires for euer, Ao 1525, after this manner. Albert attired in a complete habite of a master of the order, presented himself humbly on his knees before King Sigismund, sitting in his Throne. The King raising him from the ground, causeth him to put off those Roabes, and attire himself in a Dukall habite; which done, he gaue him the Dukedome of Prussia, to hold in see of him and his successours Kings of Poland. The cō
                     pany of Knights wonderfully storme at this action, and retiring into Germany, chose one Walter Croneberg for their titulary master. About 1549 they began to waxe weary of their places; & no new knights being desirous of that profitlesse order, it vanished in short time into nothing.
                  2 Of the sword-bearers or Portglaiue in Livonia, and Lituania; it was confirmed by Innocent the third; was allied to the Marians, and separated, Anno 1541. The last Master was Vnivus, in whose time the Lutherans reformation here receiued, extinguished this order of knighthood.

This Caganus was the first that euer vanquished the Scythians: he made warres against the Turkes, which people was at this time first made known to the inhabitants of Europe: he also with the help of his associats the Hunni, invaded and possessed Pannonia, hauing vanquished the Gothes and Gepidi, who here dwelt. Against this Caganus, Mauritius the Emperour waged warre, more with an intent to reuenge himself on his own souldiers, which had formerly offended him, then with hope of preuailing against the enemie. Comentiolus according to the Emperours directions, betrayeth his Armie, 12000 of them were slaine, and the rest taken. Caganus a heroick and mercifull Conqueror, offers to ransome them for 8s 6d apiece, (for somuch was that nummus, or

This they did, and she showing them to her Husband, he demaunded of her, Qui sunt isti Longobardi? Hence the name. They were compelled by scarcity of victuall, to seek new habitations:

Of the Longobardian Kings ensuing, I will particularly make mention onely of Lamissus, and of him this Story. Agilmond the second King of the Lombards, one morning went a hunting. As he was riding by a fish-pond, he spied seuen children sprawling for life, which one (as faith Paulus Diaconus) or (it may be) many harlots had bin deliuered of, & most barbarous

                  y thrown into the water. The King amazed at this spectacle, put his borespeare or hunting pole among them. One of the children hand-fasted the speare, & the King softly drawing back his hand, wafted the child to the shore. This boy he named Lamissus, from Lama, which in their language signified a fish-pond. He was in the Kings Court carefully brought vp, where there appeared in him such tokens of vertue and courage, that after the death of Agilmond, he was by the Lombards chosen to succeed him.

                  12 Alboinus, who by the sollicitation of Narses, went into Italy, and erected there the Longobardian Kingdome; which 200 yeares after, was demolished by the puissance of Charles the Great. The History of this people is Epitomized by Silvester, in his Du Bartas, thus:

                        The Lombard strong who was in Scowland nurst,
                        On Rugeland, and Liuonia seazed first.

                        The death of Agilmont; the bold Barbarian
                        Surprises Poland; thence anon he presses
                        In Danows streames to rense his amber tresses:
                        When he straight after had surrendered
                        The double-named Isters flowrie bed,
                        To scarre-sac'd Hunnes: he hunteth furiously
                        The rest of Gaules, from wealthie Insubrie.
                        There raignes 200 yeares, triumphing so,
                        That royall Tesin might compare with Po,
                        Which after fell in French mens hands againe,
                        Wonne by the sword of worthy Charlemaine.
                     
                  
               
               At the departure of the Lombards into Italy, the Hunnes again settled themselues in this Country, which they had before bin compelled by the Lombards to abandon. These Hunnes were a people of Asia,

                   Their first expedition was against the Ostrogothes, inhabiting the shores of Pontus Euxinus, and Moeotis; whom without great difficulty they vanquished: and pursuing their victories, broke into this Country, then called Pannonia. Macrinus the Roman Lieftenant here encountred them in two set battailes; in the first he was victorious, but not without great losse, there being slain on both sides, aboue

300000 men; in the second he was slaine, and his army routed, the Hunnes buying this victory with the losse of 40000 souldiers, Anno 401. These Hunnes after this battaile, quietly setled themselues in this Prouince, and some 38 yeares after their first entrance into it, chose for their King one Attila, a wise and valiant man; of whose warres, and how he should be called

                   this renowned and victorious Captaine, are (by Bara) said to be Gules, a Falcon displayed Or, membred and armed Argent. After the death of Attila, who reigned 44 yeares, the glory of the Hunnes began to decline, and was then in the Ecclipse, when the Lombards vnder the King Adoinus, forsook their habitation which they had settled in the North parts of Germanie, & subdued this Country, Anno 530. The Lombards stayed not here long, but they were by Narses sollicited to come into Italy, which invitation they willingly accepted; and re-yeelded ap Pannonia to the Hunnes, conditionally, that if their journey succeeded not prosperously, they might be receiued and permitted to liue amongst them. The Hunnes hearing how happily the designes of the Lombards thriued in Italy, expected not their returne; but sent for the Avares, and others their confederates and allies, to inioy together with them the riches and goodnes of this Region, which about this time, and at their comming in, begun to be called Hungavaria. Long after they were expelled by Charles the Great, but returned again to the number of one million, in the dayes of the Emperour Arnulphus, about the yeare 900, and recouered their forsaken habitations. Here haue they since continued, but not without a miserable affliction by the Tartars; 500000 of whom, tyrannized here for the space of 3 yeares, committing incredible spoyles and massacres, Anno 1248.

This people was by Strabo the Geographer called Davi: from which the Athenians in their Comoedies, called the Servants and Sycophants by the name of Davus, because the Daui were so servile and officious.
               They were long free from the command of the Romans, and had their proprietary kings, of whom the last was Decebalus, a man both ready in advice and quicke in execution.

When they meet at feasts or bankets, they drinke small draughts at the beginning; which by degrees they increase, till they come to the height of intemperancy: at which point when they are arriued, they keepe no rule or order; whereas before, to drinke out of ones turne is accounted a point of incivility. Hence, as I beleeue, sprung our by-word, As merry as a Greeke, and the Latine word Graecari.

A language excellent for Philosophy and the liberall arts, but more excellent for so great a part of the meanes of our saluation deliuered therein: for the lofty sound, significant expressions of the mind, genuine suauity and happy composition of diuers words in one, so excellent aboue others; that euen in the flourishing of the Roman Commonwealth, it ouertopped the Latine; insomuch that most of the histories of Rome were writ in this tongue, as Polybius, Dion Cassius, Appian, and the like. It also was once of wonderfull extent, in Greece, Natolia, Italy, Province, and almost all the Ilands of the Mediterranean. But now partly through mutilation of some words, and compaction of others; partly by the confusion of the true sound of vowells, dipthongs, and consonants; and the translating of the Accents; to which may be added the commixtion of the language of forraine nations: the language is not only fallen from its elegancy, but also frō its largenesse of extent; as being confin'd within Greece, and there not only much corrupted, but almost quite devoured by the Sclavonian, and Turkish tongues.

                     PELOPONNESVS is a peninsula rounded with the Sea, except where it is tied to the maine land of Greece, by an Istmus of 5 miles in breadth; which the Grecians and Venetians fortified with a strong wall, and 5 Castles. This was called Hexamilium, and was ouerthrowne by Amurath the second, who harassed and spoyled all the Countrey. It was afterwards in the yeare 1453, vpon a rumour of a new warre, built vp againe by the Venetians (who then had the greatest part of this Country) in 15 daies: there being for that time 30000 men imploied in the worke. This wall extended from one sea vnto the other; which had it beene as warily guarded, as it was hastily built; or as it was well fortified, had it beene so well manned: might easily haue resisted the Turks, vntill more meanes had bin thought on to defend it.

Yet at last the Souldiers, being frighted with the blood which abundantly broke forth; with the groanes and roarings which they continually heard▪ and with the Hobgoblins & Furies, which were alwaies in their sight: perswaded the Emperor, now halfe out of the humour, to leaue this, and inioyne them some more profitable seruice.

This Elis was of old called Olympia, famous for the Statue of Iupiter Olympicus, one of the worlds 7 wonders, being in height 60 cubits; composed by that excellent workman Phidias, of gold, and ivory. In honor of this Iupiter were the Olympicke games instituted by Hercules on the hill Olympus in Thessalie. The 2 d City is Pisa, whose people following Nestor to the warres of Troy, in their returne were by tempest driuen to the coasts of Italy; where they built the City Pisa.

In this City Menelaus was king, whose wife the faire Helena, was the cause of the destruction of Troy. 2 Pilon, where Nestor was King, now called Navarino. 3 Methone or Medon. This people had once great sway in this Peninsula, for whose sole Empire they were long corriuall with the Spartans: who at last getting the vpper hand of them, oppressed them with miserable slauery.

                      In the confines of this Country stood a Temple of Diana, common alike to the Messenians, Spartans, & Dores. It hapned that some Spartan Virgins were by the Messenians here rauished; which abuse, the Spartans pretended to be the ground of their warre; the true reason indeed being, their couetousnes of the sole Empire. This warre broke out 3 times. The first continued 20 yeares, in which space the Lacedaemonians fearing their absence would hinder the supply of yong children

This warre prospered, till Aristocrates King of Arcadia, one of the confederates, revolted, to side with Lacedaemon. Then began they to decline, and Aristomenes was thrice taken prisoner, still miraculously escaping. His last imprisonment was in a dungeon, where by chance espying a Fox deuouring a dead body, he caught hold of her taile: The Fox running a way, guided Aristomenes after; till the straitnesse of the hole by which she went out, made him leaue his holt, and fall to scraping with his nailes; which exercise he neuer left, till he had the hole passable, and so escaped; and hauing a while vpheld his falling Country, died in Rhodes. The third warre was like drops after a tempest. In this the Messenians were forced to abandon their Country; which they could neuer again recouer, till Epaminondas hauing vanquished the Lacedaemonians at Leuctra, restored them to their ancient possessions.

A rare mixture of gouernment. The discipline of this citty, both in warre and peace, made it feared by the neighbours as well as honoured.

                      The people were accounted the chiefe of all the Grecians, and directed the rest as subordinate to them. At last the Athenians hauing conquered many large Prouinces in Asia, began somewhat to Ecclipse their glory; which they not enduring, warred against Athens; and after many losses on their parts susteined, took the city, and dismantled it. Immediatly followed the warre betwixt them, & the Boeotians; the Athenians couertly, and the Persians openly assisting the enemy. Here their prosperity began to leaue them; for beside many small defeates, Epaminondas the Theban so discomfited them, at the ouerthrowes of Leuctra and Mantinea; that Sparta it selfe was in danger of vtter ruine. Not long after hapned the Holy-warre, wherein they also made a party: but this warre being ended by King Philip, they scarce breathed more freedome, then he gaue aire to. But when Alexanders Captaines fought for the Empire of their master, all these flourishing Republickes were either totally swallowed into, or much defaced by the Kingdome of Macedon. The Lacedaemonians held the chiefe strength of a towne to consist in the valour of the people; and therefore would neuer suffer Sparta to be walled, till the times immediatly following the death of Alexander the Great: yet could not these Fortifications defend them from Antigonus Doson King of Macedon; who hauing vanquished Cleomenes King of Sparta, entred the towne, and was the first man that euer was receiued into it as Conquerour; so much different were the present Spartans from the valour & courage of their ancestors. Here liu'd the famous Captaines Euribiades, the Admirall of the Navy against Xerxes, Lisander: & Agesilaeus. The second City of note is Leuctra on the sea side. 3 Thalana, nigh

vnto which is the Lake Lerna, where Hercules slew the monster Hydra, & the mount Tenarus, from whence the same champion drew the three-headed Dog Cerberus, as the Poets called him; and 4 Selassia, where Antigonus vanquished Cleomenes.

Worse fared the Guise and Byron in France; worse Essex, and Dudley of Northumberland with vs; neither will I omit William Duke of Suffolke, who hauing serued 34 yeares in our French warres, and for 17 yeares together, neuer returning home, was at his returne, basely made away.

For this fact, the Athenians so honoured his memorie, that they thought no man worthy to succeed him as King; and therefore committed the managing of the state to Gouernours for terme of life, whom they called Archontes,

What successe the Persians had in Greece, the Histories of these times abundantly informe vs. Darius being vanquished by Miltiades at Marathron; and Xerxes by Themistocles at Salamis: yet did not Athens scape so cleare, but that it was taken by Xerxes,

fortified it with high & defensible walls; which done, they put their Fleet to sea, & spoyled the coasts of Persia in all quarters; enriching their city with the spoiles, & enlarging their power & dominion, by the addition of many Ilands and sea-townes. Hereby they grew vnto that wealth & potencie, that they were suspected by their weaker neighbours,

In the beginning of this warre the Athenians not only resisted the whole powers of all Greece confederate against them; but so exceedingly prospered, that the Spartans sued for peace, and could not get it. But the scales of Fortune turned; for after they had held out 28 yeares, they were cōpelled to pluck down the walles of their town, & submit themselues to the order of the Lacedaemonians, now by the puissance of Lysander victorious. Then was this Virgin-Town prostituted to the lust of 30 Tyrants, whom not long after, Thrasibulus a braue souldier, & one that loued the liberty of his Country, expelled. This warre was called Bellum Peleponnesiacum. Not long after, the Persians seeing how the State of Sparta, for want of the opposition of Athens, began to worke vpon their Empire; furnished Conon a worthy Gentleman of Athens, with a Navy so wel furnished, that therewith he vanquished the Lacedaemonian Fleete; & put the Athenians by this victory in so good heart, that they once more reedified their walls. Immediatly after followed the warre against Thebes,
                     
                        Plutarch.
                      called Bellum sacrum, which in the end was composed by Philip of Macedon, by bringing as well the Thebans whom he came to succour, as the Athenians, Spartans, & Phocians, whom he came to oppose, all vnder his owne dominion: from which slauery, Greece neuer recouered, till as well Macedon, as she, became follow-seruants to Rome.

                  2 MEGARIS hath on the East Attica, on the West Sinus Corinthiacus, on the North Boeotia, & on the South the Isimus. The chiefe city is Megara, now Megra, where Euclide taught Geometrie. Ovid maketh mention of one Nisus King of this Country, not so happy that his head was circled with a Coronet, as that thereon grew a purple haire; to which was annexed the preseruation both of his life & Kingdome. This Iewell his daughter Scylla deliuered to King Minos, her Fathers enemy: who ioyfully receiuing the present, commanded her to be cast into the Sea; where she was (as some write) turned to the gulfe so named. I leaue the moralizing of the Fable, to such as prosesse Mythologie; obseruing only by the way, the antiquity of that politique practise, to loue the Treason, & hate the Traitours. This Country after shaking off the Cretans, became sui iuris; and amounted to that height of prosperity, that they contended with the Athenians for the Iland of Salamis, & so crushed them in one fatall ouerthrow, that a Law was enacted in Athens, that whosoeuer mentioned the recouery of Salamis, should loose his life: so that Solon was compelled to fain himselfe mad, the safelier to motion the matter, which had a prosperous end. This fortune of the Megarenses lasted not long in so eminent a degree; yet they continued a free people, till the comming of the Macedonians. The second town of note in Megaris is Eleusis, vvhere Ceres had a Temple, vvhich is hence called Ceres Eleusina.

                  The chiefe citty is Thebes, built on the brook Cephisus, by Cadmus the Phoenician. Famous it is for the warres here made of old between Eteocles & Polinices, sonnes to that vnfortunate Prince Oedipus, & his mother & wife Iocasta. The History of this warre is the most ancient piece of story which we finde of all Greece; the former times & writings containing nothing but Fables, little sauouring of humanity, & lesse of truth: As of well changed into Monsters, the adulteries of the gods, & the like.

                      that they could neuer after re-obtaine their former puissance. This Common-wealth long flourished, & at last being ouerburdened in the Phocian warre, was glad to submit it selfe to the mercy of the Macedonians, vnder the leading of King Philip: who by this meanes first got footing in Greece, into which afterward he thrust his whole body. Vpon the death of Philip, Thebes revolted from the Macedons; but Alexander his successor quickly recouered it; & to dishearten the Greeks in the like attempts, he razed the city, selling all the inhabitants of age & strength: only Pindarus house he commanded to be left standing, in honour of that learned Poet. At the sack of this town, one of the Macedon souldiers entred the house of a principall woman, named Timoclea, rauished her, and rifled her coffers: but still demaunding more treasure, she shewed him a deep Well, saying that there all her mony was hidden. The credulous villain stooping down to behold his prey, she tumbled into the Well, and ouer-whelmed with stones; for which noble act, the generous Captain highly commended, & dismissed her vnhurt. The City was re-edified by Cassander, & is now called Scibes. 2 Daulis, which was vnder the subiection of Tereus King of Thrace, who hauing rauished Philomela, daughter to Pandion, King of the

                      There were slain in this battail, Mardonius himselfe, & 260000 Persians; but on the side of the Grecians, 31 Lacedaemonians, 52 Athenians, 16 Arcadians; and of the Megarenses about 600. The Lieftenant-Generall was Pausanias, who afterward plotting to make himself the Tyrant of all Greece, and being discouered, fled into the Temple of Pallas. In this place it was almost a sacriledge to meddle with him; & therefore they resolued to close vp the doore, his mother voluntarily laying the first stone. Before this battle, the Athenians had an Oracle, that they should be conquerours, if they fought in their own territories; whereupon the Plateans, within whose iurisdiction the battle was fought, gaue that part of their Country to the City of Athens: In requitall of which worthy donation, Alexander the great re-edified & inlarged their city. 4 Leuctra, where the Thebans vnder the conduct of Epaminoudas, vanquished the Lacedamonians, slew their King Cleombrotus; & not only preserued their own liberty, but brought their enemies to that fall of courage and reputation, that they could hardly euer rise again. 5 Asc ra, the birth-place of Hesiod, a man (according to Paterculus) elegantis ingenij, & carminum dulcedine memorabilis: though the proud Critick Scaliger, intending to deifie Virgil, most iniudiciously and absurdly preferreth the worse Verse in the Georgickes of the one, before the whole workes of the other. 6 Cheronea or Coronea, the birth-place of Plutarch.

that vpon this divulging of his passion, the diuels who vsed to deliuer Oracles, with great grief and lamentations forsook the office, which had bin so profitable to them in seducing the blind people.

Here is no incestuous mixture of father & daughter; no pandarismes of old midwiues, no vnseemly action specified, where heat of blood and opportunity meet: nor in deed any one passage vnworthy the chastest eare. 2 Lamia where the Athenians after the death of Alexander, hoping to recouer their freedome, besieged Antipater. This war was called Bellum Lamiacum, and was the last honourable action, vndertaken by that great and renowned Citty. 3 Demetrias seated on Sinus Pelasgicus. 4 Larissa, situate South of Demetrias on the same bay, where Achilles was borne. 4 Pharsalis, nigh vnto which was that bloody battaile betweene Caesar & Pompey, for the Lordship of the vvorld. Caesar herein vvas conquerour. The victory vvas more famous then bloody,

Before the field vvas fought, the Pompeians vvere in such a miserable security, that some of them contended for the Priesthood, which vvas Caesars office: others disposed of the Consulships and offices in Rome▪ Pompey himselfe being so retchlesse, that hee neuer considered into what place he were best retire, if he lost the day; or by what meanes he might prouide for his safety, & raise new forces. As if the warre had beene made against some ignoble enimy, and not against Caesar; who had taken 1000 Townes; conquered 300 nations; tooke prisoners one million of men, and slaine as many. In the same fields but somewhat nigher to the City of Philippi, was the like memorable conflict betweene Augustus and Antoni

latter being by fortune rather then valour ouerthrowne. For either thinking the other vanquished, slew himselfe: these two being the last that euer openly stood for the common liberty; or as Cordus in Tacitus calleth them, Vltimi Romanorum, The last of all the Romans. And 5 Pherae where Alexander the tyrant raigned; against whom that notable Captaine Pelopidas fighting, was slaine. He was in the end murdered by his wiues brothers: all Thessalie by his death recouering liberty.

He was originally of Argos; and by an oracle commanded to lead a Colonie into this Country; and to follow the first flocke of Cattell he saw before him. Being here arriued in a tempestuous stormy day, he espied a heard of Goates flying the fury of the weather. These Goates he persued vnto Aedessa, into which by reason of the darknesse of the ayre he entred vndiscouered; wonne the towne, and in short space became Lord of all the country. 2ly

Antipater in the mean time succeeding Perdiccas in the Proctourship, died▪ which advantage Olympias (whom Antipater, extreamely hating her, had banished into Epirus) taking, entred Macedonia, put to death Aridaeus and his wife Euridice, and proclaimed Hercules the sonne of Alexander, king; but was not long after, together with her nephew and daughter, barbarously slaine by Cassander. The royall blood thus extinct, Antigonus took on himselfe the title of King: the like did Seleucus, who had now recouered all the Persian Prouinces beyond Euphrates: the like did Ptolomie in Egypt, and Cassander in Macedon.

And here raigned King Cotis, whom I mention not as a Tyrant, but propose as a patterne of rare temper, both in mastering and preuenting passion. For when a neighbor Prince had sent him a present, of accurately wrought, and purely mettall'd Glasses; he (hauing dispatched the messenger with all the due complements of Maiesty and gratitude) broke them all to pieces; lest if by mishap, any of his seruants doing the like, might stirre him to an intemperate choller.
                  This Country fell into the hands of Philip of Macedon, by a strife between two brothers for the kingdome, who after many acts of hostility, at last appealed to this Philip; and he making his best advantage out of their disagreement, seazed on it to his own vse.

It was from the first taking of it, the seat of the Turkish Kings, vntill Mahomet the Great by the disunion of Christendome, forced Constantinople, and transferred the seat to that city. 9 Pera, of old Galata, a Town of the Genowaies: It was taken by Mahomet the Great, Anno 1453: in which yeare he brought such a reckoning before Constantinople, that she not able to discharge her score, forfaited her liberty. 10 Constantinople is seated in a commodious place for an Empire, ouer-looking Europe and Asia; & commanding the Euxine Sea, Propontis, and Hellespont. It is in compasse 18 miles, in which compasse are comprehended 700000 liuing soules: yet certainly it would be more populous, if the plague like a Tertian ague, did not so rage amongst them euery third yeare. It was built by Pausanias a Lacedaemonian Captaine, 663 yeares before Christs appearing in the flesh; and was by him called Bizantium: It was of wonderfull strength at the beginning of the Roman Empire. The wals were of a iust height, euery stone being cemented together with brasse couplets, that the whole wall seemed to be but one entire stone: neither wanted there turrets, bulwarkes, and other fortifications▪ This City sided with Niger against Severus, and held out a siege of three yeares, against almost all the forces of the world. During this time they endured such want of sustenance, that men meeting in the streetes, would (as it were) with ioint consent, draw and fight, the victor still eating the vanquished: For want of artillery to discharge on the assailants, they flung

at them whole Statua's made of brasse; and the like curious Imagery. Houses they plucked down to get timber for shipping; the hair of their women they cut off, to inch out their tacklings: and hauing thus patched vp a Navy of 500 saile, they lost it all in one tempest. When they had yeelded, the Conqueror hauing put to the sword the chief of the Nobles, and giuen the rest as a spoyle to the souldiers, dismantled the Town, & left it almost in rubbish: yet there appeared such signes of beauty & strength in the very ruines, V

Afterwards it was reedified by Constantine the Great, who made it the seat of his Empire, and thus named it, Anno 315. He adorned also this City with magnificent buildings, with curious statues, and the like ornaments: which he hither transported from Rome: which City he spoyled of more ancient and costly monuments, then any twenty of his predecessours had brought thither. At this day the chief buildings are the Turkes Seraglio, and the Temple of Saint Sophia, which as they differ not much in place and situation,

                     Sophia, was, if not built, yet reedified by the Emperour Iustinian. It is built of an ovall forme, surrounded with pillars of admirable workmanship, adorned with spacious and beautifull galleries, roofed all ouer with Mosaique worke, and vaulted vnderneath very strongly for the fabrick, and pleasing for the eye. The doores are very curiously wrought, and plated; one of which by the superstitious people is thought to haue bin made of the planks of Noahs Arke: and yet this Temple is litle more then the Chancell of the ancient Church, which contained in length 260 foot, and 180 in height; and to our Saint Pauls in London, may seeme for the bignes to haue bin but a chappell of ease. It is now a Turkish Mosquo, and ioyneth close to the Seraglio, which is diuided from the rest of the City by a lofty wall 3 miles in circuit. It was first built by the Emperour Iustinus, and hath bin by the Ottomans much enlarged; the buildings yeelding to those of France, and Italy, for contriuement: but farre surpassing them for cost and curiousnesse. It conteineth 3 Courts one within the other, very pleasing both for exercise and recreation.

                  What were the revenues of this Empire since the diuision of it into the East and West, I could neuer yet learne. That they were exceeding great, may appeare by three circumstances. 1 Zonaras reporteth that the Emperour Basilius had in his treasury 200000 talents of gold, besides infinite heapes of siluer & other moneyes. 2ly 
                     Lipsius relateth how Beniamin a Iew, in his discourse of Europe, saith that the customes due to the Emperor, out of the victuals and merchandise sold at Constantinople onely, did amount to 20000 Crownes daily. 3ly we find that at the sacke of Constantinople, there was found an invaluable masse of gold, siluer plate, and Iewels, besides that which was hid in the earth. For so the couetous Citizens chose rather to imploy their wealth, then afford any part of it to the Emperour, who with teares in his eyes, went from doore to doore to beg or borrow money, wherewith he might wage more souldiers for the defence of the Town.
                  The Armes of the Empire are Mars, a crosse Sol, betweene foure Greek Beta's of the second; the foure Beta's signifying, (as Bodin saith)

               THE GRECIAN ILES.
               HAuing discoursed of the Continent, & its particular kingdomes; we will say somewhat also of the Sea, & its particular Iles: which lye dispersed either in the Grecian, 2 Cretan, 3 Ionian, 4 Adriatique, 5 Mediterranean, 6 Brittish, or 7 Northerne Seas; and first of such as are about the coasts of Greece.
               
               The first Sea which offreth it self vnto vs, is Palus Maeotis, so called of the Maeotae, who formerly inhabited about the banks of it. It is nourisht by the riuer Phasis, Tanais, & infinit others, & aboundeth with a kind of fish, which the ancients called Maeotides. The present name of this Sea, is Mar di la Tana, & hath in it no Iland of note. Hence the Sea going Southward, is brought into a narrow streight, called Bosphorus Cimmerius, from the Cimmerij who here dwelt: of no great bredth, in that oxen haue swomme ouer it, and in length about 27 miles. This streight openeth into Pontus Euxinus.
               
               
                  Pontus Euxinus is in compasse 2700 miles,
                     Boterus.
                   and was first called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , from the inhospitablenesse of the neighbouring people, which being brought to some conformity, caused the sea to be called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . It is now called Mare Maggiore for its greatnes: and the Blacke Sea, because of the darke mists thence arising. Others not improbably affirme, that it is called the Blacke sea, from the dangerous and black shipwrackes here happening: For it is a very dangerous shore, full of rocks and sands: and for this cause there is on the top of an high towre, a lantherne, in which there is a great panne full of pitch, rozen, tallow, and the like, in dark nights continually burning, to giue warning to marriners, how neere they approach the shore. This Sea being the biggest of all these parts, gaue occasion to them which knew no bigger, to call all Sea a by the name of Pontus, as

Of this sea the chiefe Iles are 1 Thinnius, and Erithinnus, little famous.
               
                  
                     Strabo.
                  The Sea bending Southward, is coarctated into narrow bounds, not being fully a mile broad; and called Thracius Bosphorus: Thracius for its site nigh Thrace; and Bosphorus for that Oxen haue swomme ouer it. It hath no Iland worth naming.
               This straight hauing continued 20 miles in length, openeth it selfe into the Propontis 330 miles in compasse, now called Mare di Marmora, from the Iland Marmora: which formerly called Proconesus, hath for its abundance of Marble, purchased this new name.
               The Sea hauing gathered hir waters into a lesser Channell, is called Hellespont; from Helle, daughter to Athamas King of Thebes, who was here drowned. Ouer thi

                  ts. When all the Persians soothed the King in the vnconquerablenesse of his forces, Artabanus told him, that he feared no enemies but the Sea and the Earth; the one yeelding no safe harbour for such a Navie; the other not yeelding sufficient sustenance for so multitudinous an Armie. His returne ouer this Hellespont was as deiected, as his passage magnificent; his fleet was broken by the valour of the Greekes, and the fury of the sea; so that for his more speedy flight, he was compelled to make vse of a poore fisher boat. Neither yet was his passage secure: the boat being ouer-burdened, had sunke all, if the Persians by casting away themselues, had not saued the life of their King: The losse of which noble spirits so vexed him, that hauing giuen the Steeresm

It is now called the castles, or the sea of the two castles; which two castles stand one on Europe, the other on Asia side; in the same places where once stood Sestos and Abydos. These castles are exceeding well built, and abundantly furnished with munition. They search and examine all shippes that passe that way: they receiue the Grand Signieurs customes; and are in effect the principall strength of Constantinople. At these castles all shippes must stay three dayes; to the end, that if any slaue be runne away from his master, or theeues haue stollen any thing, they may be in that space pursued and apprehended. In this Hellespont is the Iland Tenedos, on Asia side. It is in compasse ten miles, and was so called from one Tenes, who abhorring the lasciuious intreaties of his mother, was by her command cast into the Sea, fast locked in a Chest; and here most miraculously deliuered, as Strabo writeth:

                     Insula diues opum, Priami dum regna manebant.

                        Strabo.
                      and little famous: only proud in this, that Pythagoras that diuine Philosopher, and Samo one of the Sybils, were here borne. Here also was Iuno by the Poets fained to haue bin borne, because Iuno allegorically signifieth the Aire, which is here most cleare and pure. The chief town is Samia, beautified with a goodly harbour, but now by the pyrats often infesting these seas, almost left desolate.
               
               
                  
                  2 LEMNOS.
                  LEMNOS containeth in circuit 100 miles. The chief citty was Hephestia, where Vulcan was adored, who being but a homely brat, was by Iuno cast down hither, and so no maruaile if he haue got a halting. Here is digged the soueraigne minerall against infections, called Terra Lemnia, and Sigillata. The former name proceedeth from the Iland: the latter is in force, because the earth made into little pellets, is sealed with a Turkish Character or signet, and so dispersed ouer Christendome. It was once called also Diospolis from the two chief cities herein, of which the first was Hephestia aboue-named, now altogether decayed: the 2d 
                     Lemnos or Myrina, yet continuing, though with no great lustre. The Country is plaine, is compared with the adjacent Ilands, the Westerne parts dry and barren, the East more fat and fruitfull. It containeth in all 75 Villages, inhabited by the Greekes all except three, which are fortified by the Turkes; who being Lords of the whole Iland, call it by a new name, Stalimene.

                     LESBOS on the Asian side, containeth in compasse 168 miles: the South and West parts being but mountainous and barren, the rest leuell and fruitfull. The chiefe cities are Erissus. 2 Methimna, and 3 Mitilene. The former is of little estimation, the two latter took name from the two daughters of Macarios; the elder of which Mitilene was married to Lesbos (the son of Lapithus) of whom the whole Iland took denomination.

               This Country was subiected to the Romans by Marcellus, (surnamed for this action) Creticus: and being afterward part of the Greeke Empire, was called Candie, either from the chiefe city, or the white rockes: It was giuen by Baldwin Earle of Flanders, the first Latine Emperour of Constantinople, to Boniface of Montferrat; who sold it Anno 1194, to the Venetians: who notwithstanding all real rebelliōs of the natiues, & threatned invasions of the Turkes, still enioy it. For for the defence of it from a forraine power, they haue furnished the Iland with 78 or 80 Galleyes for the defence of the shores: and haue exceedingly fortified the hauen of Suda, with two strong castles; this hauen being capable of more then 1000 vessels, and therefore meritoriously reputed the doore and entrie into the country. It is reported that the King of Spaine, Philip 2d, did offer vnto the Venetians for this hauen, money more then inough; but it could not be accepted. For though the Spaniard seemed only to intend the retreit and reliefe of his own Navie, when he should vndertake any expedition against the Turke; yet the wise Venetians saw, that by this hauen he might at all times awe, & when he listed, surprise the whole Country. Against the attempts of the natiues, they haue garrison'd Canea with 7 companies of souldiers: Candie with 2000 souldiours, and the lessers cities proportionably; ouer which there is set so streight a guard, that a naturall Cretian is not permitted to enter weaponed into any of them.

                  CORCYRA (now Corfu, formerly Phaeacia) so called from a virgin of that name, whom Neptune here deflowred; is distant 12 miles from Epirus. It stretcheth East and West in forme of a bow, and in length is 54 miles, 24 in breadth; and is seated cō;veniently for the Venetians, as being the center of their Lordship by sea. The chiefe Citty is Corfu, which the Turks by their repulses haue found impregnable. For it is situate at the foot of a mountaine, on the topp of which are built two vnaccessible fortresses, as being strongly fenced with a naturall rocke. The one of these is called The old fortresse; the other The new; both iustly esteemed the chiefe bulwarkes of Venice, whose trade & potēcy would soone fayle, were these forts in any others hands. For this cause the two Captaines are sworne before the Senate of Venice, neuer to haue mutuall conuerse or intelligence one with the other, either in word or writing: least by the corruption of one Captaine, the other might perhaps be wrought from his allegeance. Neither is their command there for more then two yeares, their commission then terminating, and new successours being sent them. 2 Pagropoli. 3 Castello St

it Sicania. As for the name of Sicilia, some deriue it from Sicileus a supposed king of Spaine, who is fabled to haue conquered this country: but the truth is, it came from the Siculi, who being by Evander and his Arcadians, driuen out of Latium, came into this Iland: to which, hauing mastred the Sicani, they left their name. In succeeding ages there came hither diuers Colonies of the Greekes, who planting themselues only in the coast-parts of the country; altered not the name, by which at their comming they found it called.

The totall number of them is about one million and 300000 soules.

In this Country is the hill Hybla, so famous for bees & honey, and the hill Aetna, now called Montgiball, which continually sendeth forth continuall flames of fire, to the astonishment of a

The reason of these fires is the abundance of sulphure & brimstone, contained in the bosome of this hill; which is blowne by the winde, driuing in at the chappes of the earth, as by a paire of bellowes: through which chinkes also, there is continually more fuell added to the fire, the very water administring an operatiue

It was built by Archias of Corinth, who being for an vnnaturall rape committed on a yong Gentleman, banished his Country, together with his friend and companion Miscellus; consulted with the Oracle of Delphos. The Oracle demanded whether they affected rather wealth, or health; to which when Miscellus replyed health, and Archias wealth, the Oracle directed the former to Crotona in Italy; and the latter hither. It contained in it 4 Townes as it were, viz: Ile, Acradin, Neapolis, and Tyche, together with the Fort Hexapyle, commanding all the rest. It was the custome of this Towne, when any of the Nobility began to grow too potent among them, to write his name in an Oliue leafe, which being put into his hand, without any further ceremony, banished him for fiue yeares.

                  After this Iland was once known to the Greekes, there came from all parts of Greece, colonies to inhabite it, as from Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Mesene, Megaris, and the rest: who winning vpon the Natiues, planted themselues in the Country. Here in tract of time was managed a great part of the Peloponnesian warre, the Athenians siding with the Leontines; and the Spartans with the Syracusians: in which the whole power of Athens was broken by sea and land; and their two Captaines, Nicias & Demosthenes, murdred in prison.

The conditions by the Pope proposed, were so impossible for the Earle to performe, that his Agent told the Pope, he might as well say to his Master, I giue the Moone, climbe vp, catch it, and take it. The Earle thus refusing it, it was offered to the King his brother, for his second son Edmund, who was invested by the gift of a ring, and in his name the Pope coined money, with the inscription of Aimundus Rex Siciliae.

Here is also great aboundance of cotton-wool (Gossypium the Latinists call it) which they sow as we doe corne. The stalke is no bigger then that of wheat, but stronger and tougher, the head round bearded, and hard as a stone, which when it is ripe, breaketh, & is deliuered of a white soft bumbast, mixed with seedes; which they separate with an instrument, selling the wooll, and reseruing their seed for the next haruest. This Iland is in the Scriptures called Molita, and is said to be the place where S. Paul shooke the Viper off his hand. Famous also is it for the Councel held here against Pelagius, by Pope Innocent the first, at which S. Austine was present, and 214 Bishops.

Concerning the originall and riches of these Knights, we shall speak when we come into Palestine; now a word or two only of their places, and the election of their great Master. None are admitted into the order, but such as can bring a testimony of their Gentry for six descents; and when the ceremonies of their admission (which are many) are performed▪ they sweare to defend the Church of Rome, to obey their superiours, to liue vpon the revenues of their order only, and withall to liue chastly. Of these there be 16 of great authority (Counsellers of state we may call them) called, the Great Crosses, out of whom the officers of the order, as the Marshall, the Admirall, the Chancellor, &c: are chosen; and who, together with their Master, punish such as are cōvict of any crime, first by degrading him, 2ly by strangling him, and 3ly by throwing him into the sea. Now when the Great Master is dead, they suffer no vessell to goe out of this Iland, till another be elected, lest the Pope should intrude on their Election, which is performed in this manner. The seuerall Seminaries nominate two knights, and two are also nominated for the English: these 16 from amongst themselues choose 8: these 8 choose a Knight, a Priest, and a Frier servant; and they three, out of the 16 Great Crosses, elect the great Master. The great Master being thus chosen, is stiled though but a Frier, The most illustrious, and most reuerend Prince, the Lord Frier N N:

From these the Genowaies conquered it, from them it was taken by the Pisans: but recouered again by the Genowaies, who still enioy it.
                  The people are churlish, stubborne, poore, vnlearned, & vse a corrupt Italian. They are said to be the progeny of the 52 daughters of king Thespias, who being gotten with childe by Hercules in one night; were by their father put to the mercy of the Sea; which wrought them to this Iland; which they and their posterity peopled, till the comming of the Tyrians.

               ANd now we are come into the OCEAN, that ingens & infinitum pelagus, as Mela calleth it: in comparison of which the Seas before mentioned are but as Ponds or Gullets: a sea in former times knowne more by fame then triall, and rather wondred at on the shoare side, then any more remote place of it. The Romans ventured not on it with their vessels (vnlesse in the passage from France to Brittaine) and much famed is Alexander for his hazardous voyage on this vnruly Sea, hee having sayled in all but 400 furlongs from the shoare, The name and pedegree take here both from the Poets and Etymologists. The Poets make Oceanus to be the sonne of Coelum and Vesta, or of heauen & earth. They tearmed him the father of all things as Oc

                      whose comming into and denominating this Iland, is rather a fabulous report, then a well grounded historicall truth: I will take the Etymologie of M. Camden, as most probable, who fetching it from the Brittish language; deriueth it from Brit, signifying painting, and Tayne, signifying a nation: which agreeth not only with the Brittish tongue, but with the records of the most sincere & trusty Historiographers; all with one consent, affirming, that the Brittaines vsed to paint themselues, to make them shew more terrible to the enimy. For that there was no such Brutus, is euident, 1 by the newnesse of his birth; Geofrie of Monmouth, who liued in the dayes of Henry the 2d, being his first father. 2ly By the silence of the Roman histories, in which it had beene an vnpardonable negligence, to haue omitted an accident so remarkable, as the killing of a father by his sonne, and the erecting of a new Troian Empire in Brittaine. 3ly By the arguments which Caesar vseth to proue them to bee deriued from the Gaules; as speech, lawes, customes, disposition, structure, & the like. 4ly by the testimony of all the Roman writers, who affirme the Brittaines to haue beene distracted into many petty royalties, and not to be vnder the command of any one Prince: Summa belli administrandi communi consensu permissa est Cassivella

This same wall was built by Severus the Emperour for a fortresse against the Picts: at every miles end was a Castle, betweene every Castle many watch-towres; & through the walls of every Towne and Castle, was conveighed a pipe of brasle; which from one Garrison to another conveied the least noise without interruption: so that the newes of an approaching enimy was quickly divulged ouer the borders, & resistance made accordingly. In after times insteed of this wall, the strong Townes of Berwicke & Carlile were the chiefe barres by which we kept the back-dore sh

Within the heart of the land there were indeed too many, which being in the hands of subiects, was no small incouragement to their often rebellions, and no little incombrance in quenching them to the Kings: vntill toward the end of the reigne of K. Stephen, 1100 of them were laid leuell with the ground, and the few which remained were dismantled & made vnseruiceable. This care was taken to disable the Lords & Commons at home: but for keeping the Sea-coasts from forraine enimies, little or no care was taken. The dangerous rockes and steepe cliffes were accounted a strength sufficient. Only the Castle of Douer, and a few of the like peeces were well fortified & furnished, as well for the safety

of the land, as the command of the sea. Afterwards in the yeare 1539 Henry the eight hauing shaken off the Romish tyranny, and seeing how the Emperour Charles was offended for the divorce of his aunt, the Queene Katharine; how the French King had married his sonne to the Popes Neece, & his daughter to the King of Scotland: thought it best to prouide for himselfe and his people.

Yet did neither of these erect any Castles in the inward parts of the realme, herein imitating nature, who fortifieth the head and feet only, not the middle of beasts: or some Captaine of a fort, who plants all his ordinances on the walls, bulwarkes, and out-workes; leauing the rest as by these sufficiently guarded.
                     The whole Iland was once called Albion, not from the Giant Albion, but ab albis rupibus, the white rocks towards France. Afterwards it was called Brittaine, which name continued till the time of Egbert the first Saxon Monarch, who called the Southerne part of the Iland, England: from the Angles, who with the Iu

It is in length 320 miles; enioying a soyle equally participating of ground fit for tillage & pasture: yet to pasture more then tillage are our people addicted, as a course of life not requiring so many helpers, which must be all sed and paid; and yet yeelding more certaine profit. Hence in former times husbandry began to be neglected Villages depopulated, and hindes, for want of entertainment, to turne way-beaters: whereof St

To prevent this mischiefe there was a statute made in the 4th yeare of Henry the seuenth, against the converting of errable land into pasture ground: by which course husbandry was againe reuiued, and the soyle made so abounding in corne, that a deare yeare is seldome heard of. Our Vines are nipped with the cold, and seldome come to maturity, & are more vsed for the pleasantnesse of the shaddowe, then for the hopes of wines.

Hence it flyeth through Berks, Buck: Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, & Essex; and so weddeth himselfe with the Kentish Medway, in the very iawes of the Ocean. This glorious river seeleth the violence of the Sea more then any riuer in Europe, ebbing & flowing twice a day more then 60 miles: along whose banks are so many faire Townes and princely pallaces, that a German Poet thus truely spoke.

                         In an absolute woman, say the Italians, are required the parts of a Dutch woman, from the girdle downeward; the parts of a French woman, from the girdle to the shoulders; ouer which must be placed an English face. As

their beauty, so also their prerogatiues are the greatest of any nation; neither so servilely submisse as the French, nor so iealously guarded as the Italian; but keeping so true a decorum: that England, as it is tearmed the purgatory of Servants, & the hell of Horses; so it is acknowledged the Paradise of Women. And it is a common by-word among the Italians, that if there were a bridge built ouer the narrow seas, all the women of Europe would runne into England. For here they haue the vpper hand in the streets; the vpper place at the table; the thirds of their husbands estates; and their equall shares in all lands, yea euen such as are holden in knights service; priuiledges wherewith other women are not acquainted.
                     The Wooll of England is of exceeding finenesse, especially that of Cotswold in Glocestershire; that of Lemster in Herefordshiere; and of the Ile of Wight: Of this wooll are made excellent broad cloaths, dispersed all ouer the world, especially high Germany, Muscovie, Turkie, and Persia; to the great benefit of the Realme: as well in returne of so much mony which is made of them; as in setting to worke so many poore people, who from it receaue sustenance. Before the time of King Edward the third, Engl

                           shmen either had not the art, or neglected the vse of making cloaths: in which times our wooll was transported vnwrought. And as his successours haue laid impositions on euery cloath sold out of the realme; so his predecessours had, as their occasions required, some certaine customes granted on euery sack of wooll. In the beginning of this Edwards warres with France, the citties and townes of Flanders, being then euen to admiration rich, combined with him and ayded him in his wars there. And he for his part by the composition then made was to giue them 14000 pounds ready mony; to aide them by Sea and land if need required; & to make Bruges, then a great mart towne of Christendome, the St

                         and he hauing by experience seen what the benefit of these Staples were; remoued them from Bruges into England. And for the ease as well of his subiects in bringing their wools vnto the ports, as of such forraine marchants as

came to buy, he placed his Staples at Excester, Bristoll, Winchester, Westminster, Chichester, Canterbury, Norwich, Lincoln, York and Newcastle, for England: at Ca

                           hmen should transport this stapled commodity; no not by licences (if any such should bee granted) on paine of confiscation, and imprisonment during the Kings pleasure. Lastly he allured ouer hither diuerse Flemmings which taught our men the making of cloathes (who are now growne the best cloathworkers in the world:) and to encourage men in this art, it was by a statute made the 27th of Edward the 3d, enacted to be felonie, to carry any wools vnwrought. When England had for some short time inioyed the benefit of these Staples, the King remoued them to Calice, which hee had conquered and desired to make wealthie. From hence they were at severall times and occasions translated, now to one, now to another towne in Belgia: and still happy was that towne in what Country soeuer, where the English kept a house for this traffick▪ the confluence of al people thither to buy, infinitly enriching it. Antwerp in Brabant long enioyed the English Merchants, till vpon some discontents betweene K. Henry the 7th, and Maximilian Archduke,

And the giuing of some Cotswold sheepe by K. Edward the 4th to Henry of Castile, and Iohn of Arragon, Anno 1465: is counted one of the greatest preiudices that euer hapned to this kingdome. The English house is now at Stoade, being by reason of the warres in these parts, remooued from Antwerpe.
                     
                     The wooll transported bringeth into the kingdome no lesse then 1500000l, and the Lead halfe that summe; so that Lewis Guicciardine reporteth, that before the warres of the Low Coū

                     After the Popes traditions had long annihilated the worth of the Scriptures, it pleased God to stirre vp Luther and the rest, to endeauour a reformation; which in other Countries receiued tumultuously, was here entertained with mature deliberation; the English bearing respect neither to Luther, Zwinglius, not Calvin, as to the square of their faith; but abolishing such things as were dissonant to Gods word, retained such ceremonies, as without offence the liberty of the Church might establish. Wherein certainly they dealt more advisedly then their neighbours, who in meere detestation of the Romish Church, abrogated such things altogether, which their abuse had defiled, though neuer so decent; & allowed in the Primitiue Church. And no doubt, had the reformed part continued an allowed correspondency in some circumstances, with the Romish Church, a

A resolution worthy him that spake it.

                        England is patible of a threefold division. 1 into 6 circuits, destinated to the Itinerary Iudges. Secondly, into 22 Episcopall Dioceses: Thirdly, into 40 Shires. The Realme was first diuided into circuits by King Henry the second, who appointed, that twice in the yeare, two of the most graue and learned Iudges of the Land, should in each circuit administer Iustice in the chiefe or head townes of euery country. Of these Iudges, one sitteth on matters criminall, concerning the life and death of melefactours; the other in actions personall, concerning title of land, debts, or the like, between party & party. The first circuit (for we will begin at the West) comprehendeth the Counties of Wiltes, Somerset, Devon, Cornewall, Dorset, & Southampton: the second containeth the Counties of Oxford, Berkes, Gloucester, Monmouth, Hereford, Worcester, Salop, & Stafford. The third hath in it the Counties of Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Essex, and Hartford. The fourth consisteth of the Shires of Buckingham, Bedford, Huntingdon, Cambridge, Norfolke, and Suffolke. The fifth of the Shires of Northampton, Rutland, Lincolne, Nottingham, Derbie, Leicester, and Warwicke. And the sixt and last, of the Shires of Yorke, Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancaster. So that in these six circuits are numbred 38 Shires. The two remaining, are Middlesex, & Cheshire; wh
                           •
                        reof the first is exempted, because of its vicinity to London: and the second, as being a Countie Palatine, and hauing peculiar Iudges, and Counsellers to it selfe.
                     Our Church-gouernment is as we haue said, by Archbishops, & Bishops, which are in number 22; and so many are the Episcopall Dioceses. Archbishops we haue two, one of Yorke, vnder whom are Bishops of Chester, Durham, & Carlile; the other of Canterburie, who is Primate and Metropolitan of all England, vnder whom are the 17 other Bishops of England, and the 4 of Wales. This Archbishop of Canterburie vsed to take place in all Councels at the Popes right foot: which took beginning at the Councell of Lateran, when Vrban the second

called Anselme the Archbishop from among the other Prelats then assembled, and placed him at his right foot, saying; Includamus hunc in orbe nostro, tanquam altorius orbis Papam, Ao 1099. They also were accounted Legatinati; which honourable title was first giuen to Archbishop Theobald by Pope Innocent the second, and so perpetuated to his successours. Both these Archbishops, together with all the Bishops of Wales and England, haue their place and suffrage in the high Court of Parliament, as Barons of the Realme; and that in a double respect: first in relation had to their offices; next to their Baronries which they hold of the King. Yet doe they not inioy all the prerogatiue of temporall Barons; for they must not be tryed by their Peeres, but must be left to a Iury of 12 ordinary men: neither can they in examination, make a protestation on their honour, but must be put to their oathes. As for the Ecclesiasticall Courts, besides such as appertaine to the Archbishop himselfe, besides such as the Chancellour of euery Bishop holdeth in his Diocese; besides Courts holden in priuat Parishes, which are called Peculiars, & besides the Visitations, which are the assemblies of all the ministers in a Diocese, before their Bishop or his ordinary, there is the Synode or Convocation, which is as it were a Parliament of the Cleargy. In this Synode there assemble for the reforming of the Church, whether it be for point of faith or discipline; & for the granting of tenths & fifteenths vnto the King; all the right reuerend Fathers the Archbishops & Bishops; the Deanes of Cathedrall Churches. & a certain number of ministers chosen out of euery Diocese; these last being as it were the Knights & Burgesses of the house.
                     The Shires were first made by King Alfred, both for the easier & speedier administration of iustice:

                         & because the naturall inhabitants of the Land, after the example, and vnder colour of the Danes, committed sundry outrages & robberies Ouer euery one of these Shires & Counties, he appointed a Sheriffe; and diuers Iustices, to see into the behauiour of priuate men▪ and to punish such as were deliquent: and in times of warre either already begun, or intended, he instituted a Prefect or Liestenant; to whom he gaue autority to see to their musters, their prouision

of armes; & if occasion serued, to punish such as rebelled or mutinied. This wise King ordeined also, that his subiects should be diuided into tens or tithings, euery of which seuerally should giue bond for the good abearing of each other; and he who was of that dissolute behauiour, that he could not be admitted to these tithings, was forthwith convayed to the house of correction. By this course men were not carefull only of their own actions, but had an eye to all the nine, for whom he stood bound; as the nine had ouer him; insomuch that a poore girle might trauell safely with a bagge of gold in her hand, & none durst meddle with her.

Of those shires the biggest is Yorkeshire, out of which it is thought that 70000 footmen might be leuied, and in them all are comprehended 145 Castles, or rather the ruines of Castles, of which few are of any strength, and such as are, are in the Kings custody: it being nothing profitable to the State, to permit any man to fortifie himselfe in a well-contriued Castle. Here are also 9725 Parishes, besides Chappels, equal in bignes to many Parishes. Of these Parishes there are 585 Market Townes, being no Cities; the chiefe of which are Shrewesbury, Northampton, Southampton, Leicester, &c.
                     The Cities are in number 22, the chiefe of which are 1 London, pleasantly seated on the Thames, which diuideth it into two parts: ancient is this City, and long flourished before the Roman conquest, by whom it was called Augusta. Her circuit may containe 8 miles, in which space are 121 Parish Churches; the Palace of the King, the houses of the Nobility; Colledges for the study of the Lawes, (I meane not the Ciuill Law, which is Ius gentium, but (as we call it) the Common Lawes, appropriate only to this kingdome, of greater antiquity and indifferency then the Ciuill. It is wondrous populous, containing well nigh 400000 people, which number is much augmented in the

That the Vniuersitie of Cambridge is not of so great a standing, as that of Oxford, is euident by the testimonie of Robertus de Remington, cited by M.

For by this ouer-straining his worths, the pidling writers of former times haue onely giuen posterity iust occasion to suspect that vertue, which they so much thought to adorne: and filled vs with as much ignorance of the Story, as admiration of the persons. But this hath not bin King Arthurs case alone; for in the same measure & kind, haue the French Monkes vsed Charlemaigne, and the 12 Peeres of France. This Arthur is said to haue begunne the custome of solemnizing the Natiuity of our Sauiour, for the 12 dayes next after his birth-day; with such feasts and sports, as are yet vsed by the lords of misrule in some Gentlemens houses: an ordination which the Scottish Writers of these times much blame, it being a time fitter for our devotion, then our mirth.

They were both vnited vnder the name of Northumberland by Ethelsride.

                     Now concerning the Danes abiding here, and going hence, as they did, I obserue three customes yet in vse amongst vs. First, each English house maintained one Dane, who liuing idly like the drone amongst the bees, had the benefit of all their labours, and was by them called Lord Dane: and euen now when we see an idle fellow, we call him a Lurdane. 2ly The Danes vsed, when the English drank, to stabbe them or cut their throats; to avoid which villanie, the party then drinking, requested some of the next sitters to be his surety or pledge, whilst hee paid nature her due: and hence haue we our vsuall custome of pledging one another. 3ly The old Romans at the expulsion of their kings annually solemnized the Fugalia: according to which patterne, the ioyfull English hauing cleered the country of the Danes, instituted the annuall sports of Hock-tide; the word in their old tongue the Saxon, importing the time of scorning or triumphing. This solemnity cōsisted in the merry meetings of the neighbours on those dayes, during which the festivall lasted; & was celebrated by the younger sort of both sexes, with all manner of exercises and pastimes in the streets; euen as Shrouetide yet

                        15 Edward the Confessour. This King collected out of the Danish, Saxon, and Mercian lawes, one vniuersall & generall lawe; whence our Common lawe is thought to haue had its originall: which may be true of the written lawes, not of the customary and vnwritten lawes; these being certainly more ancient. He was in his life of that holinesse, that he receaued power from aboue to cure many diseases; amongst others the swelling of the throat, called by vs the Kings evill: a prerogatiue that continueth hereditary to his successours of England. Finally after his death he was canonized for a Saint: & died hauing raigned 24 yeares.

Hee was with all ioyfull acclamations saluted King of England, March the 24, Anno 1603.
                     
                     The revenewes of this kingdome were in King Henry the sevenths daies, reckoned by Boterus to be but 400000 crownes: which afterward he saith to be improu'd to a milliō & 300000 crownes; yet falleth he farre short of the true proportiō: which since I doe not directly knowe, I will not ayme at, lest I should shoot as wide from the marke.
                     Concerning the place due to the Kings of England in generall councells, and the ranke they held among other Christian Princes, I finde that the Emperour of Germany was accounted Maior filius Ecclesiae; the King of France, Minor filius; and the King of England, Filius tertius, & adoptivus. The K. of France in generall councels had place next the Emperour on his right hand; the King of England, on his left hand; & the King of Scotland next before Castile. Now indeed, the King of Spaine being so much improued, is the deerely beloued sonne of the Church, & arrogateth to himselfe the place aboue all other Princes: but in the time of Pope Iulius the 2d, controversie arising between the Embassadours of these two Princes for precedency: the Pope adiudged it to belong of right vnto England. And Pope Pius the fourth, vpon the like controversie, arising between the Embassadours of France and Spaine; adiudged the precedency to the French.
                     
                     The Armes of England are Mars, 3 Lions passant Gardant, Sol. The reasons why these Armes quartred with the French,
                        
take the second place; are 1 because that France is the larger & more famous kingdome: 2 That the French seeing the honour done to their Armes, might more easily be induced to haue acknowledged the English title. 3 Because the English Armes is compounded of the Lion of Aquitaine, and the two Lions of Normandie; being both French Dutchies.

Arthur, there where Sir Vr a wounded knight, came to be cured of his hurts, it being his fate, that only the best Knight of the whole order could be his Chirurgion. The principall of thē were Sir Lancelot, Sir Tristrum, Sir Lambrocke; Sir Gawaine, &c. They were all placed at one Round Table, to auoide quarrels about priority and place. The Round Table hanging in the great hall at Winchester, is falsely called Arthurs Round Table; it being not of sufficient antiquity, and containing but 24 seats. Of these knights there are reported many fabulous stories. They ended with their founder, and are fained by that Lucian of France, Rablaies, to be the Ferry-man of hell: and that their pay is a peece of mouldie cheese, and a phillip on the nose.

                         instituted by King Edward the third, to increase vertue and true valour in the hearts of his Nobility; or as some will, in honour of the Countesse of Salisburies Garter, of which Lady, the King had formerly bin inamoured. There are of this order 26 knights, of which the kings of England are Soueraignes: and is so much desired for its excellency, that 8 Emperours, 22 forraine kings, 20 forraine Dukes, and diuers Noblemen of other Countries haue bin followers of it. The ensigne is a blew Garter, buckled on the left leg, on which these words are embroydered, viz: Honi soit qui mal y pense. About their necke they weare a blew ribbond, at the end of which hangeth the image of S. George, whose day is the installation day.

                     VVALES is bounded on all sides with the Sea, except the East, where it is separated from England by the riuer Dee, and a line drawne to the riuer Wie. But the most certain and particular limit is a huge ditch, which beginning at the influxe of Wie into the Seuerne; reacheth vnto Chester, where Dee is mingled with the sea, euen 84 miles in length. It was built by Offa king of the Mercyans, and is in Welch called Claud Offa, that is, Offa's Dike. Concerning this ditch King Harald made a law, that what Welchman soeuer was found with a weapon on this side of it, he should haue his right hand cut off by the kings officers.
                     The ancients were the Silures possessing Radnor, Brecknocke, Monmouth, and Glamorgan shires: the Dimetae inhabiting Carmardan, Penbrooke, & Cardigan shires: the Ordouices dwelling in Montgomerie, Merioneth, Denbigh, Flint, and Carnarvon shires.
                     As for the name of Wales, some deduce it from Idwallo, sonne to Cadwallader, who with the small remainder of the Britons, retired vnto this Country. But this Etymologie is by the greater number not approued, though we find many etymons farre more wrested then this is. Others very iudiciously coniecture, that as the Britons deriue their pedegree from the Gaules, so they also retaine the name. For the Frenchmen to this day call this people Galloys; and the Country Galles: which by vsing W
                        
for G, according to the custome of the Saxons, is Walloys and Walles: And further, the Germans as yet call some nations of France by the name of Wallons. I for my part dare be of this opinion▪ though I know the generall conceit is, that after the Saxons had gotten plenarie seisin & deliuerie of England, the Brittaines who fled hither, were by them called Walli or Welshmen, because they were of diuers manners and language; this name importing as much as Aliens.
                     The Country is very mountainous and barren. Their chiefe commodities are woollen cloathes, as cottons, bayes, &c. These merchandises are from all parts of Wales brought vp vnto Oswestre (which is the farthest town in all Shropshire) as vnto a common emporie. For hither on Mundayes (which are the market dayes) come from Shrewsbury the cloath-merchants, and drapers there dwelling; buy these commodities, carry them home, and from thence disperse them into all parts and places of the kingdome.
                     They haue here also a tripartite division, 1 into three circuits; for the administration of Iustice. The first conteineth Flint, Denbigh, and Montgomerie shires; the second Radnor, Glamorgan, and Brecknocke shires: the third Cardigan, Carmarthen, and Pembrooke shires: and the fourth the Counties of Merioneth; Carnarvon, and the Isle of Anglesey, Wales is secondly diuided into foure Dioceses for Ecclesiasticall discipline: and thirdly into twelue Shires; in which are comprehended Snowdon hils, the Brethen, and Plinlimmon: 1 chase, 13 forrests, 36 parkes, 99 bridges; 2
                           •
                        0 Riuers: the chiefe of which are Dee, arising nigh Carduvaure hils, in Merionethshire, and falling into the sea not farre from Chester. Ouer this riuer Edgar K. of England was rowed by 7 inferiour kings. 2 Wie in Latine called Vaga, arising in Plinlimmon hills, and emptying it selfe into the Seuerne at Chepstowe. The riuers which are more in the heart of the Country, (for these two are but borderers) are 1 Conwy, which arising in Merionethshire, and diuiding Denbigh from Carnarvonshire, mingleth with the sea at Aberconney. 2 Tiuie, which arising in Montgomeryshire, and passing betweene Carmarden, Penbrooke, and Cardigan shires; runneth into the sea a little below

                        Cardigan: and 3 Chedhydy, which running quite through Pembrookeshire, emptieth it selfe into Milford hauen; one of the most safest and capacious hauens, not in England alone, but in the whole world.
                     The men are of a faithfull carriage, one especially towards another, in a strange Country; and to strangers in their owne. They are questionlesse of a temper much inclining to choller, as being subiect to the passion called by Aristotle 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ; by which men are quickly mooued, and soone appeased, of all angers the best and noblest. The Welch language hath the least commixture with forreine words, of any vsed in Europe; & by reason of its many consonants, is lesse pleasing.
                     Here are 1016 Parishes, of which are 56 market towns, (being no cities, and in them 41 castles) and 4 cities, viz: S. Dauids or Meneuia in Pembrookeshire: 2 Bangor in Carnarvonshire; 3 Asaph in Flintshire. 4 Lannaff in Glamorganshire, being all the seates of so many Bishops, who comprehend vnder their seuerall Dioceses all Wales, and acknowledge the Archbishop of Canterbury to be their Metropolitan. As for S. Dauids, it was in former times an Archbishops See; but a grieuous pestilence here raging, the See was translated into litle Brittaine in France. The ordinary market-townes; for so many as I haue seene, are generally fairer then ours in England, and were for the most part built not onely for mutuall commerce of the neighbouring villages; but also for strength and ability of resistance; as being well seated and fortified with walls & castles: Though now partly by the iniquity of time, which is

                     In this country & (as I am informed) in Cardiganshire, haue lately some siluer-mines bin found out, by that industrious & worthy Common-wealths-man, Mr. Thomas Middleton: to the glory of this particular Country, & the profit of the whole Monarchie of Great Brittaine.

In him ended the line of the Princes of North-wales, who had for the space of 405 yeares, resisted not only the priuate vndertakers of England, who were commonly of the Nobility; but the whole forces also of many most puissant Monarchs: Whose attempts they alwayes made frustrate, by retiring into the heart of their country, and leauing the English more woods and hills to encounter, then men. But now the fatall period of the Brittish liberty being come, they were constrained to yeeld to the stronger.
                     
                     What Prouinces North-Wales containeth, is before said; to these we must adde the Ile of Anglesey, (which hereafter wee shall describe) in one of whose townes, called Aberfrawe, the Princes hereof vse to reside; and thereupon were called kings

of Aberfrawe. Shrewsbury also as long as they continued masters of it, was the seat royall of these Princes, who had heere a very faire palace: which being burned in some of their broyles with England, is now converred into priuate gardens, for the vse of the citizens. The farthest bridge of

                     The Armes of the Princes of North-Wales, were quarterly Gules and Or; foure Lyons passant gardant, counter-hanged.

This Country was by th'aboue-mentioned Rodericke giuen vnto his second soone Amarandus; whom he chose to rule ouer the borders, because he was a man of approued valour. The residence of these Princes was at Mathrafall, who for that cause were called kings of Matrafall. It was then a great and a faire town; now nothing in a manner, but a bare name: and standeth in an equall distance betweene Welch-poole, and Lanvilling, in Montgomeryshire.
                     
                     It continued a principality, till the time of Edward the first. To whom at a Parliament holden at Shrewsbury, Owen ap Griffin Prince thereof, resigned his lands & title: and receiued them againe of the King to hold in Capite, and free baronage, according to the custome of England. Avis or Havis daughter and heire to this Owen, was married vnto Iohn Charleton a Valect, (or Gentleman of the priuie Chamber) to Edward the 2d: by

whom in right of his wife, he was made Lord of Powis. It continued for foure descents in this line; and then the marriage of Iane, daughter and heire of Edward the last Lord, vnto Sir Iohn Grey, conveighed vnto him this title: which together with his issue, is now extinct.

                        10 Griffin II, in whom ended the line of the Princes of South-wales, after they had with great struggling maintained their liberty, the space of 300 yeares or there-about. The English nobility had at seueral times plucked many townes, Lordships, and almost whole shires, from this principate: which were all againe recouered by this last Griffin; who not long enioying his victories, left the fruits of them to his two sonnes, Cynericke, & Meredith, both whom our Henry 2d tooke, and put out their eyes. Yet did the Welchmen, as well as in such a time of calamitie they could wrestle, & tugge for their liberty; till the felicity of Edward the first, put an end to all the warres and troubles in these part.
                     
                     It may perhaps be maruailed at, why Rodoricke the great, in the diuision aboue-mentioned, gaue vnto his yongest sonne, the greatest & most fruitfull part of this whole Country. To which we answere, that South-wales indeed was the greater & richer; but yet accompted the worser part; because the Nobles there refused to obey their Prince; and also for that the Sea-coasts were grieuously infested with Flemmings, English, & Normans. In which respect also the Prince was enforced to remoue his seat from Carmarden, then called Maridune; vp higher vnto Dynefar or Devenor castle, where it continued euen till the Princes themselues had left to be: who for this cause were called Kings of Dynefar.

                        When King Edward had thus fortunately effected this great businesse, he gaue vnto his English Barons, and other gentlemen of good revenue and potencie, diuers signieuries & estates here; as well to honour their valour shewed in the conquest, as to engage so many able men, both in purse and power, for the perpetuall defence and subjugation of it. As for the lordship of Flint, and the townes and estates lying on the sea-coasts, he held them in his own hands, both to keep himselfe strong, and to curb the Welch, and (wherein he dealt like the politique Emperour Augustus) pretending the ease of such as he had there placed; but indeed to haue all the armes, and men of imployment vnder himselfe onely.
                     This done, he diuided Wales into six shires, viz: 1 Glamorgan, 2 Carmarden, 3 Pembrooke, 4 Cardigan, 5 Merioneth, and 6 Carnarvon, after the manner of England. Ouer each of these as he placed a particular English Lieftenant; so was he very desirous to haue one generall English Vicegerent, ouer the whole body of the Welch. But this when they mainly w
                           •

                         the king assembled the Brittish Lords, and offered to name them a Gouernour borne in Wales, which could speak not one word of English, & whose life no man could taxe. Such a one when they had all sworne to obey, he named his yong son Edward, since which time, our Kings eldest sonnes are Princes of Wales. Their investiture is performed by the imposition of a cap of estate, & a coronet, on his head that is invested, as a token of his principality: by deliuering into his hand a verge, being the embleme of gouernment: by putting a ring of gold on his finger, to shew him how now he is a husband to the Country, & a father to her children; & by giuing him a patent, to hold the said principalitie to him and his heires Kings of England. By which words, the separation of it from the Crowne is prohibited; & the Kings keep in themselues so excellent an occasion of obliging vnto them their eldest son
                           •
                        , when they pleased. In imitation of this custome, more ex Angliá translat

                         (saith Mariana.) Iohn the first of Castile & Leon, made his son Henry Prince of the Asturia's; which is a Country so craggie and

mountainous, that it may not improperly be called the Wales of Spaine. And all the Spanish Princes euen to these times are honoured with this title of Prince of the Asturia's.
                     
                     Notwithstanding this prouident care of Edward the first, in establishing his Empire heere, & the extreme rigour of Law here vsed by Henry the fourth, in reducing them to obedience after the rebellion of Owen Glendower: yet till the time of Henry the eighth, and his father, (both being extract from the Welch blood) they neuer contained themselues, or uery seldome, within the bounds of true alleageance. For whereas before they were reputed euen as Aliens; this Henry made them (by act of Parliament) one Nation with the English; subiect to the same Lawes; capable of the same preferments; & priuiledged with the same immunities. He added sixe shires to the former number, out of those Countries which were before reputed as the borders or marches of VVales; and enabled them all to send knights and burgesses vnto the Parliaments; So that the name and language only excepted, there is now no difference between the English & Welch; happy vnion.
                     The same King Henry established for the ease of his Welch subiects, a Court at Ludlow, like vnto the ordinary Parliaments in France; wherein the Lawes are ministred according to the fashion of the Kings Courts of Westminster. This Court consisteth of one President, who is for the most part of the Nobility, and is generally called the Lord President of Wales; of as many Counsellers as it shall please the King to appoint; one Atturney; one Sollicitour; one Secretary; and the foure Iustices of the counties of Wales. The same Ludlow, (for this must not be omitted) is adorned with a very fair castle; which is the Palace of such Princes of VVales, of the English blood, as haue come into this Country, to solace themselues among their people. Here was yong Edward he fift, at the death of his father: and here died Prince Arthur, eldest son to Henry 7th, both being sent hither by their fathers to the same end, viz: by their presence to keep in order the vnquiet Welchmen. And certainely as the presence of the Prince was then a terror to the rebellious, so would it now be as great a comfort to this peaceable people.
                     
                        What the reuenues of this principality are, I cannot say; yet we may boldly affirme that they are not very small, by these two circumstances, in the marriage of the Lady Catharine of Spaine, to our abouenamed Prince Arthur. For first her father Fernando, being one of the wariest Princes that euer were in Europe, giuing with her in Dowry 200000 Ducats; required for her iointer, the third part only of this principality, & of the Earldome of Chester. And 2ly after the death of Prince Arthur, the Nobles of the Realme perswaded Prince Henry, to take her to wife; that so great a treasure, as the yearely revenewe of her ioynture, might not be carried out of the kingdome.
                     The Armes of the Princes of Wales differ from those of England, only by the addition of a labell of three points. But the proper and peculiar device, and which we commonly, though corruptly, call the Princes Armes; is a Coronet beautified with three Ostrich feathers, and inscribed round with Ich

This Coronet was wonne by that valiant Prince, Edward the blacke Prince, at the battaile of Cressie, from Iohn King of Bohemia, who there wore it; & whō he there slew. Since which time it hath beene the cognisance of all our Princes.
                     I wil now shut vp my discourse of Wales with that testimony of the people, which Henry the 2d vsed in a letter to Emanuel Emperour of Constantinople, The Welch nation is so aduenterous, that they dare encounter naked with armed men; readie to spend their bloud for their Country, and pawne their life for praise: and adding only this, that since their incorporating with the English, they haue shewed themselues most loyall, hearty, and affectionate subiects of the State.

                     THE BORDERS.
                     BEfore we come into Scotland, wee must of necessity passe through that batable ground, lying betweene both kingdomes,

called THE BORDERS: the inhabitants wherereof are a kinde of military men, subtile, nimble, & by reason of their often skirmishes well experienced, and aduenturous. Once the English border extended as farre as vnto Edenborough, East; and to Sterling, West: nigh vnto which last towne, there was ouer the Friths of Dunbritton, a bridge built; and in a crosse thereon standing, there was written this pasport,

                           I am free march as passengers may kenne;
                           To Scots, to Brittans, and to Englishmen.
                        
But when England groaned vnder the burden of the Danish oppression, the Scots well husbanded that aduantage; and not only enlarged their border to the Tweede; but also tooke into their hands, Cumberland, Northumberland, and Westmorland. The Norman Kings againe recouered these Prouinces, making the Borders of both kingdomes to bee Tweede, East; the Solway, West; and the Cheviot hills in the midst. Of any great warres made on these borders, or any particular officers appointed for the defence of them, I finde no mention till the time of Edward the first; who taking aduantage on the Scots disagreements, about the successour of Alexander the third; hoped to bring the Country vnder the obedience of England. This quarrell betweene the two nations he began, but could not end; the wars surviuing the author. So that what Velleius saith of the Romans and Carthaginians, I may as well say of the Scots and English: for almost three hundred yeares together, aut bellum inter eos populos, aut belli praeparatio, aut infi
                              •
                           a pax fuit. In most of these conflicts the Scots had the worst, so that Daniel in his history seemeth to maruell how this corner of the Ile could breed so many, had it bred nothing but men, as were slaine in these wars: yet in the raigne of Edward the 2d, the Scots (hauing thrice defeated that vnhappy Prince) became so terrible vnto the English Borderers, that an hundred of them would fly from three Scots. It is a custome among the Turkes not to beleeue a Christian or a Iew complaining against a Turk

neuer to beleeue any Scot complainining against an Englishman, vnlesse some other Englishman will witnesse for him; & so on the other side: Ex iure quodam inter limitaneos rat

                        ere were diuers here liuing, which acknowledged neither King: but sometimes were Scots, sometimes English, as their present crimes and necessities required protection or pardon. To keepe in this people, and secure the Borders, there were in each Kingdome three officers appointed called the Lords wardens of the Marches: one being placed ouer the East, the other ouer the West, the third ouer the middle borders. In England the Warden of the East Marches had his seat at Berwicke (a towne of great strength, and which for the conveniency of its situation, was the first thing which the English tooke care to defend, and the Scots to surprise) of which he was also gouernour. The Warden of the West Marches, had his seate in Carlile, which Henry the 8th for that cause well fortified. The Warden of the middle Marches had no set place of residence, but was sometimes in one place, sometimes in another, according as occasions required. But Imperij medium est, terminus ante fuit, by the blessed marriage of the kingdomes, that being now the middle of one, which was then the bounds of two Empires: these officers, and the cause of them, the warres, are quite extinct.
                  
                  
                     SCOTLAND.
                     SCOTLAND is the Northerne part of Brittaine, & separated from England by the riuers Tweed, and Solway; and the Cheuiot hils extending from the one to the other. It is in length (according to Polidor) 480 miles, but of no great breadth; there being no place distant from the Seas 60 miles; and the Country ending like the sharpe point of a wedge.

                        Scotland is by the best iudgements reckned to be 160 longer then England; England is in these Mappes made well nigh 100 miles longer then Scotland.

                     The Country is diuided into the Highland and the Lowland. The people of the former are either liuing on the Westerne cō
                        tinent of Scotland, and haue some smacke of ciuility; or in the Out-Iles, which (as his Maiestie hath in his Bas: Doron) are all vtterly barbarous, and are no waies to be reduced to ciuility, but by planting Colonies of the more in-land & orderly Scots amongst them. The Lowlanders bordering on the East are of the like ingenious dispositions and language, almost with the English. They are the ofspring of the Saxons, as euidently doth appeare, 1 by their behauiour; 2 their language; and thirdly by the testimony of the Highlanders (who are the true Scots, and speake the Irish tongue) who call both the Lowlanders, and the English, Saxons. And very probable it is (for so much I haue heard a judicious Gentleman of this nation affirme) the Scots & Saxons invading this Iland nigh at the same time; that the Saxons might seaze vpon the Easterne parts, confronting their coū
                        try; as that the Scots did possesse the Westerne side, which lay next vnto Ireland and the Westerne Ilands, from whence they first came into Brittaine.
                     
                     
                        Scotland is farre more barren then England. The chiefe commodities are course cloathes, Freezes, Fish, Hides, Lead-oare, &c.
                     The Gospell was first preached here by Palladius, Ano 431: they now follow the reformation begun by Luther, and seconded or perfected by Zuinglius and Caluin.
                     
                     The people had not long since one barbarous custome:

which was, if any two were displeased, they expected no law; but bang'd it out brauely, one & his kindred, against the other and his, and thought the King much in their common, if they granted him at a certaine day to keepe the peace. This fighting they call their Feides▪
                         a word so barbarous, that were it to bee expressed in Latine, or French, it must be by circumlocution. These deadly feids, his Maiestie in his most excellent Basilicon Doron, aduiseth his sonne to redresse with all care possible; but God hath giuen him a long life, to see it in his owne daies remedied▪ wherein he hath gotten a greater victory ouer that people, then euer any forraigne Prince, or any of his predecessours: an act indeed truely royall, and worthy himselfe. An other custome they once had of that nature, that the like hath hardly beene in Christendome; which tooke beginning as the Scottish historians affirme, in the raigne of Ewen the 3d, who is the fifteenth King in their Catalogue, after the first Fergus. This Ewen being a Prince much addicted, or rather wholy giuen ouer vnto lasciuiousnesse; made a law that himselfe and his successours should haue the maidenhead or first nights lodging with euery woman, whose husband held land immediatly from the crown: and the Lords & Gentlemen of all them, whose husbands were their tenants or homagers. This was it seemes the Knights service, which men held their estates by; & continued till the daies of Malcolme Comnor, who at the request of his wife Margaret (she was the sister of Edgar Etheling) abolished this law: ordaining that the tenants by way of commutation, should pay vnto their Lords a marke in mony, which tribute the historians say is yet in force.

It hapned at the last that Achaius married Fergusia, sister to Hungust King of the Picts; by her he had issue Alpine: who after the death of Hungust dying without issue, was in the iudgement of the Scots, to succeed in the Pictish Kingdome. But the Picts alleaging a law of not admitting Aliens to the crown, chose one Ferereth for their king; with whom A

This quarrell thus begunne, was maintained by their successours, till after many bloudy victories, and ouerthrowes on both sides; Kenneth K. of the Scots vanquished Donsken King of the Picts, and extinguished not only their kingdome, but their very name: (vnlesse we will beleeue that some of them did fly into France, & there forsooth vanquished, and inhabited the Countries called now Pictavia and Picardie.) From this Kenneth the first Monarch of all Scotland, we will beginne our Catalogue; leauing out that rabble of Kings mentioned by Hector Boetius, in his hist
                           •
                        ry of this kingdome and nation. Neither shall I herein I hope offend the more iudicious sort of the Scottish nation, especially since I

deale no more vnkindly with their Scota, and her successours; then I haue done already with our own Brutus, & his. The first Scottish King that setled himselfe in the North of Brittaine, is according to the aboue-named Hector Boëtius, one Fergus; which in the time that Coyle gouerned the Brittans, came, forsooth, into these parts out of Ireland. From him vnto Eugenius, we haue the names of 39 kings in a continued succession; which Eugenius, together with his whole nation, is said to haue beene expelled the Iland, by a ioynt confederacie of the Romans, Brit
                              •
                           ns, and Picts. Twenty & seuen yeares after the death of this Eugenius, they were reduced againe into their possession here, by the valour and conduct of one Fergus the 2d of that name. To this Fergus I referre the beginning of the Scottish kingdome in Brittaine, holding the stories of the former 39 Kings, to bee fabulous and vaine: neither want I probable coniecture for this assertion; this expedition of Fergus into Brittaine, being placed in the 424 yeare of Christ, at what time the best writers hold the Scots to haue first seated themselues in this Iland. The king of chiefe note betweene this Fergus, and Kenneth the first Monarch of all Scotland; was Achaius: who contracted the offensiue and defensiue league with Charles the great, betweene the kingdomes of France and Scotland. The conditions whereof were. 1 Let this league betweene the two kingdomes indure for ever. 2 Let the enimies vnto one be reputed and handled as the enimies of the other. 3 If the Saxons, or Englishmen invade France, the Scots shall send thither such numbers of Souldiers, as shall be desired: the French King defraying the charges. 4 If the English invade Scotland, the King of France shall at his own charges, send competent assistance vnto the King of Scotland. Neuer was there any league, which was either more faithfully obserued or longer continued, then this betweene these two kingdomes: The Scots on all occasions so readily assisting the French, that it grew to a prouerb, or by word, he that will France winne must with Scotland first beginne.
                     
                     Now before I come vnto Kenneth, I will in this place relate the story of Machbed, one of his successours: a history then which for variety of action, or strangenesse of euent, I neuer

met with any more pleasing. The story in briefe is thus D
                              •
                           ncan King of Scotland, had two principall men whom he employed in all matters of importance; Machbed and Banquho. These two travelling together through a forrest were mette by three Fairies, or Witches (Weirds the Scots call them) whereof the first making obeisance vnto Machbed, saluted him Thane (a title vnto which that of Earle afterward succeeded) of Glammis, the second, Thane of Cawder. and the third, King of Scotland. This is vnequall dealing said Banquho, to giue my friend all the honors and none vnto me: to whom one of the Weirds made answere, that he indeed should not be King, but out of his loynes should come a race of kings that should for euer rule Scotland. And having thus said they all suddenly vanished. Vpon their arriuall to the Court, Machbed was immediatly created Thane of Glammis; and not long after, some new seruice of his requiring new recompence, he was honoured with the title of Thane of Cawder. Seeing then how happily the prediction of the three Weirds fell out in the two former; hee resolued not to bee wanting to himselfe in fulfilling the third; and therefore first hee killed the King, and after by reason of his command among the Souldiers and common people, he succeeded in his throne. Being scarce warme in his seat, he called to minde the prediction giuen to his companion Banquho, whom herevpon suspecting as his supplanter he caused to be killed, together with his whole kindred, Fleance his son onely with much difficulty escaping into Wales. Freed now from this feare, he built Dunsinane Castle making it his ordinary seat: and afterward on new feares consulting with certaine wizards about his future estate; was by one told that he should neuer bee ouercome till Bernane wood (which was some few miles distant) did come to Dunsinane Castle: and by the other that he neuer should be slaine by any man borne of a woman. Secure then as he thought, he omitted no kinde of libidiuousnesse or cruelty for the space of 18 yeares, for so long he raigned, or to say better, tyrannized. Mackduffe gouernour of Fife, ioyning to himselfe some fewe Patriots, which had not yet felt the tyrants sword; priuily met one night at Bernane wood, and early in the morning marched, euery man bearing a

                         slaine by any man borne of a woman. Now then is thy fatall houre come, said Mackduffe, for I was neuer borne of a woman, but violently cut out of my mothers belly, she dying before her deliuery: which words so danted the tyrant, though otherwise a man of good performance, that he was easily slaine; and Malcolme Conmor the true heire of the Crowne, seated in the throne. In the meane time Fleance so thriued in Wales that he fell in loue with the Welch Princes daughter, and on her begat a sonne named Walter. This Walter flying Wales for a murther, was entertained in Scotland, and his descent once knowne, he was preferred to be Steward vnto King Edgar, from which office the name of Steward became as the sir-name of all his posterity. From this Walter descended that Robert Steward, who was after in right of his wife, King of Scotland; since which time there haue been successiuely nine Soueraignes of this name in Scotland. But it is now high time (the prophecies being fulfilled, and my story finished) to attend King Kenneth, & his successours.

                     The Iland hath by some bin tearmed Scotia, because the Scotti comming from Spaine, dwelt there. The most vsuall name amongst old writers, is Iernia; the moderne, Hibernia; the English, Ireland; & though some frame a wrested Etymologie frō 
                     Iberus a Spanish Captaine, some from Irnalph a Duke hereof, & others ab Hyberno aëre, the winter-like and cold aire; yet certainly the name proceedeth from Erinland, which in their old language signifieth a westerne land.

such places where the English discipline is heartily embraced, are conformable to ciuility; the Kernes (for by that name they call the wilde Irish) extreamely barbarous; not behauing themselues as Christians, scarcely as men.
                  They vse the Irish language, spoken also in the West of Scotland, and the Hebrides or westerne Ilands. They receiued the Christian faith by the preaching of S. Patricke, Anno 335. At this present, the more ciuill sort follow the reformation according to the Church of England; but the Kernes either adhere to the Pope, or to their own superstitious fancies.
                  The soyle of it selfe is abundantly fruitfull, as may be seen in such places, where the industry of man playeth the midwife with the earth, in helping her to bring forth; but on the contrary, where agriculture, and laborious manuring of the ground is deficient, there also the fruits of the earth are not, and cannot be abundant.
                  Famous hath this Country bin in former times for the piety and religious liues of the Monkes; amongst whom I cannot but remember Columban, and of him this memorable apothegme: He being offered many faire preferments to leaue his Country, replyed, It becommeth not them to embrace other mens riches, that for Christs sake had forsaken their owne. But now I should sooner find pietie amongst the Cannibals of America, then the Kernes of Ireland.
                  
                  Amongst other prerogatiues of this Iland, this is one, that it breedeth no venemous serpent; neither will any liue here, brought from other Regions. Hence of her selfe she thus speaketh,

                  The whole number of Counties in Ireland is 32, in euery of which is a Sheriffe, and diuers Iustices of peace, as in England.

                     Ireland once was diuided into fiue several Kingdomes, & first suffered a forraine power vnder Turgesius and his Norwegians, who were soone rooted out by the policy of the petty king of Meth, who was the only Irish Prince in fauour with the tyrant. This king of Meth, (by name Omalaighlilen) had to daughter a woman of renowned beauty, whom Turgesius lusting after, demanded of her father to be his Concubine. The Methian Prince vnwilling to grant, yet daring not to deny this petition, or, to say better command, for such are tyrants petitions) made answere, that he had in his tuition besides his daughter, a beuie of most beautifull Virgins, out of which he should choose as many as he pleased for his priuate pleasures. Turgesius reioycing at this motion, desired him with all speed to effect this meeting.

But the King of Meth attiring in the habits of women, a company of yong Gentlemen, who durst for the common liberty, adventure their seuerall liues, conducted them into the tyrants bed-chamber. And they according to the directions giuen thē, when for that little modesties sake he had in him, he had commanded all his attendants to auoide the roome: assaulted him now ready for, and expecting more kind embraces; and left him dead in the place. The Methian King had by this time, acquainted diuers of the better sort with his plot; all which vpon a signe giuen, rush into the palace, and put to death all the Norwegians, and other attendants of this tyrant. After this the Roytel

To this petition, Henry the second, then King, condescended, sending him ayde vnder the leading of William Strongbow Earle of Penbrooke, who restored King Dermot, & brought a great part of the Iland vnder the English subiection. Iohn king of England was the first who was intituled the L. of Ireland, which stile was granted him by Pope Vrban the 3d, who for the ornament of his royalty, sent him a Plume of Peacocke feathers, (and when Tir Oen stiled himselfe Defender of the Irish liberty, he was by the then Pope honoured with the like present.) The Kings of England retained this title of Lords til the yeare 1542, in which Henry the 8th in an Irish Parliament, was declared K. of Ireland, as a name more

Since the first plantation there, of our English people, the Countrey haeh bin gouerned by a Vice-Roy (whom we vsually call the Lord Deputie) then whom there commeth no Vice-gerent in Europe more neere the Majesty and prerogatiue of a King.

First then, a barbarous coūtry is like a field ouer-grown with weed, which must first be well broken with the plough, and then immediatly sowne with good and profitable seed: so must a wild and vnciuill people be first broken and ploughed vp by warre, & then presently sowne with the seed of good lawes & discipline: lest the weedes reuiue in the one, and ill manners in the other. Here then was the first defects in our English Kings, not to tame and take down the stomack and pride of this people; though either ciuill or forreine warres perhaps occasioned this neglect: & also of the Ir

The 2d ouer-sight concerneth particularly our kings, who gaue such large possessions and regalities vnto the first conquerours, that the people knew no authority in a maner, aboue their immediate Lords. 3ly The Laws of England were not indifferently communicated to all the Irishrie, but to some particular Families and Prouinces onely; whereby the rest of the people being in the condition of outlawes, or at the best of aliens, knew not how to behaue themselues as subiects: and this concerneth the Kings also. The 4th defect was particularly in the deputies, who hauing made good and wholsom
                        •
                      lawes against the barbarous customes of the common-people, and inhumane oppression of the Lords; neuer put them in execution: as if they had bin made rather for a terrour, or a shew, then any intent of vse or benefit to the state. And to these foure may most of the rest be reduced.

                     Thus haue you seene Ireland, which before serued onely as a graue to burie our best men, and a gulse to swallow our greatest treasures; being gouerned neither as a country free nor conquer'd; brought in some hope by the prudence & policie of her present king & late Deputies, to proue an orderly Commonwealth, ciuill in it selfe, profitable to be the Prince, and a good strength to the British Empire.

                  The revenues of this kingdome are said by Walsingham, in the time of Edward the third, to haue beene yearely 40000 pounds; but his successours to this present age, haue scarce got so much as the keeping of it cost them; King Richard the 2d being by the same Walsingham reported, to haue spent 30000 markes out of his own purse, ouer and aboue the money which he receiued there. Whether this Country were so profitable to Edward 3d or not, I dare not determine: certain I am, that the revenues at this time are double what they were before; and more orderly payed into the Exchequer then euer: the customehouse yeelding yearely no lesse then 30000 pounds.

                     THE ORCADES or Isles of Orkney, are in number 32, and are situate against the most Northerne Cape of Scotland, the chief of which is Pomonia, whose prime town is Kirkwall, honoured with a Bishops See, and strengthned with two castles. This Iland is well stoared with tinne and lead, and is at this day by the Inhabitants called Mainland. The second Iland of note is Hethy, called by Ptolomy, Ocetis. The people are (according to Maginus) great drinkers, but no drunkards, bibacissimi sunt incolae, nunquam tamen inebriantur: they vse the Gothish language, which they deriue from the Norwegians, in whose possession they once were, and of whose qualities they still retaine some smacke. These Iles in Solinus time were not inhabited, being ouer-grown with rushes; now they are in a measure populous and fertile; and were first discouered by Iulius Agricola, the first that euer sailed about Brittaine. In latter times they were possessed by the Normans or Norwegians, who held them till the yeare 1266: when Magnus King of Norwey surrendred them vp to Alexander King of Scotland; which surrendrie, some of the succeeding Kings did afterwards ratifie.
                     Two dayes sayling North of these Orcades, lieth Shetland, an Iland belonging to the Crown of Scotland; and is by many supposed to be the Thyle of the Ancients. For first it standeth in the 63 degrees of latitude, in which Ptolomie placeth Thyle: 2ly it lyeth opposite to Bergen in Norwey, against which Pomponius Mela hath seated it: and 3ly 
                        Caspar Peucerus hath obserued, that this Shetland is by marriners called Thylensell; a name in which that of Thyle is apparantly couched. That I and was not Thyle (as most say) we shall anon shew you.

and are called Redshankes; a people, as his Majestie in his Basilicon Doron teacheth vs, allutterly rude, and without all shew of ciuility; such as permit not themselues to be gouerned by the Lawes, nor to be kept vnder by Discipline, legum severitate, & iudiciorum metu se illigari non patiuntur, saith M. Camden. These Ilands were also bought by Alexander the third, of Magnus King of Norwey.
                     
                  
                  
                     THE SORLINGES.
                     These Ilands being called by the Belgians or Netherlanders SORLINGS; by the English, Silly; by Antonine in his Itinerary Sigdeles, by Solinus, Silures; and by some Greeke Writers Hesperides, and Cassiterides: are situate ouer against the most Westerne Cape of Cornewall, from which they are distant 24 miles: They are in number 145, of which ten only are of any estimation, viz: 1 Armath. 2 Agnes 3 Sampson. 4 Silly, the name-giuer (as it seemeth) vnto the rest. 5 Brefar, 6 Rusco. 7 S. Helens. 8 S. Martins. 9 Arthur, and 10 S. Maries, the chiefe of all the rest, as being eight miles in compasse, sufficiently fruitfull, & strengthened with a castle called Stella Maria, built by Queene Elizabeth, and by her furnished with a garrison. These Ilands are well stored with Grasse, Graine, and Lead, which last from hence was first carried into Greece. Hither the Roman Emperours banished condemned men to worke in the Mines. These Ilands were subdued to the English Crown by Athelstane.

                         I know not in what generall name I may more fitly include them: the chiefe of which are 1 Man, 2 Anglesey, 3 Iarsie, 4 Gernsie, 5 Wight.
                     
                     1 MAN is situate iust ouer against the Southerne part of Cumberland, from which it is distant 25 miles, and was judged to belong to Brittaine rather then to Ireland, because it fostred venemous serpents brought hither out of Brittaine. It is in length 30 miles, in bredth 15 miles, and but 8 in some places. The people hate theft, and begging; they vse a language mixt of the Norvegian and Irish tongues. The soyle is abundant in

Flax, Hempe, Oates, Barley, and Wheat, with which they vse to supply the defects of Scotland, if not the Continent it selfe, yet questionlesse the Westerne Iles, which are a member of it. For thus writeth the Reuerend Father in God, Iohn Mericke, late Bishop of this Iland, in a letter to M. Camden, at such time as he was composing his most excellent Brittania. Our Iland (saith he) for cattle, for fish, and for corne, hath not onely sufficient for it selfe, but sendeth also good store into other Countries; now what Countries should need this supply (England and Ireland being afore-hand with such prouisions) except Scotland, or some members thereof, I see not. Venerable Bede numbred in it 300 Families, and now it is furnished with 17 Parish Churches. The chiefe Townes are 1 Balacuri, and 2 Russin or Castle-towne, the seat of a Bishop, who though he be vnder the Archbishop of Yorke, yet hath he no voice in the English Parliament. In this Iland is the hill Scea-full, where on a cleare day one may see England, Scotland, and Ireland: here also are bred the Bernacles or Soland Geese, of rotten wood falling into the water. This Iland was taken from the Brittaines by the Scots, and from them regained by Edwin king of Northumberland; afterward the Norwegians seazed on it, from whom Alexander the third wrested it: and about the yeare 1340. William Montacute Earle of Salisbury, descended from the Norwegian kings of Man, wonne it from the Scots, & sold it to the Lord Scroope; who being condemned of treason, Henry the fourth gaue it to Henry Percie Earle of Northumberland: but he also proouing false to his Soueraigne, it was giuen to the Stanlies; now Earles of Darbie.

It was once the seat of the Druides, first conquered by Suetonius Paulinus, & vnited to the English Crowne by the valour of Edward the first.
                     3 IARSEY is in compasse 30 miles, and sufficiently strong,

by reason of the dangerous Seas. It containeth 12 Townes or Villages, the chiefe being S. Hilarie, and S. Malo. The ground is plentifull in graine, and Sheep, most of them hauing 4 hornes; of whose wooll our true Iarsie Stockings are made. This C

                     4 GERNSEY (formerly Sarnia) is distant 20 miles from Iarsey, to whom it is farre inferiour in respect of fertility and largenesse; but more commodious because of her safe harbours. It containeth 10 Parishes, the chiefe being S. Peters. These Ilands lye both nigh vnto Normandy and Brittaine; the people vse the French tongue, and are the only remainder of the English rights in France. In their Ecclesiasticall Discipline they follow the Church of Geneva, as most affected by their French Ministers, and are both subiect to the Diocese of Winchester.
                     
                     5 WIGHT is seuered from Hampshire by a little narrow, & dangerous straight of the Sea. It containeth 20 miles in length, and 12 in bredth; the soyle is very answerable to the husbandmans expectation, the Sheepe beare delicate fine wooll, and the trees store of fruit. Here are 2 Parkes, and one Forrest, as also 36 Townes and Villages, the principall being Newport, Yarmouth, and Brading. The Iland is very strongly seated and strengthened. The South part toward France is vnaccessible, by reason of the steepy and ruggie rocks which there guard it; the North shoare toward Hampshire is flat and leuell, and for that cause fortified with three castles: viz: Yarmouth, the Cowes, and Sandhead castle. In the midland there is Garesbrooke castle only, in which is prouision of armour for 5000 men; in euery village is a great piece of Ordinance: yet are not these external strengths so much auaileable, as the internall animosity of the inhabitants. It is subiected to the County of Southampton for her gouernment, and was taken from the Brittaines by Wolphar King of Mercia. Of this Iland Henry the sixt crowned Henry Beauchamp Earle of Warwicke, king; which title ended not long after in the death of this Beauchamp.

               OF THE NORTHERNE ILANDS.
               THe NORTHERNE sea is by some called Mare Scythicum; by Iuvenal, Oceanus Glacialis; by the Cimbrians in their tongue Marimorusa, that is, the dead sea; and by Tacitus, Mare Pigrum. The Tacitus best describeth it, & out of him I afford it you. Trans Suionas mare aliud pigrum, & prope immotum quo &c. Beyond the Swethlanders there is another sea so slow, and almost immoueable, that many think it to be the bounds which compasse in the whole World.

               1 GROENLAND is situate vnder the Northerne cold Zone, the ongest day in Summer being 3 moneths & a halfe: it is in length more then 600 miles. This Country

                  is not yet sufficiently discouered, but generally knowne to abound in grasse, which nourisheth great store of cattle: & giueth aire to a people dwelling in caues, and delighting in Necromancie. The chief Town is S. Thome, and Alba the next. In this Iland the Londoners haue met with a good trade of fishing; and for that cause, further searching into it, and oftner frequenting it, haue giuen it the new name of King Iames his new land.
               
               2 ISLAND is about 400 miles in length, a damnable cold Country, whence it seemes to take its name: The people hereof, (as some in Norway) vse dryed fish insteed of bread, the best commodity is their fish, which they exchange with forraine

Marchants for other things, of which they haue more vse, and lesse abundance. The Island Ling is famous all ouer Europe. The chiefe Townes are Hallen, and Seh

The reason which perswadeth them to this conjecture, is, because it is indeed the remotest part of the old world: but greater reasons are against it. For when Solinus saith, Multa sunt circa Britanniam insulae, è quibus Thyle ultima; I hope Thyle must be one of the Brittish Iles: and when Tacitus saith, Insulas quas Orchadas vocant, invenit domuit

               3 FREEZLAND, called in Latin Frizlandia, to distinguish it from Frizia or Freizland in Belgia; is vnder the North-frigid Zone, but not so farre within the Artick Circle as Island: the longest day being here almost 20 houres. The only riches of it is their Fish, for which commodity it is neuer without the ships of Flemmings, Scots, Danes, Hautsmen, and English, which especially so frequent it, that it hath by some bin called the Westerne England It is almost as bigge as Ireland, and is subiect to the King of Denmarke.

            OF ASIA:
            ASIA is separate from Europe by the Aegean, Propontis, Euxine Sea; by Palus Moeotis, Tanais, Duina, and a line drawne from the one to the other: and from Africk by the Red-Sea, and the Aegyptian Istmus.
            
            This most famous Country borroweth her denomination from ASIA, daughter to Oceanus and Thetis, wife to Iapetus, and mother to Prometheus. It stretcheth in length 5200, & in breadth 4560 miles.
            This Country hath worne the Garland of supereminency: 1 Because here man was created & put to till the land. 2ly Here our Saviour Christ was borne, wrought his diuine miracles, & suffered for our saluation on the Crosse. 3ly Here were done the actions memorized by the holy pen-men of the Old and New Testament. 4ly Here were the first Monarchies of the Babylonians, Assyrians, Persians, and Medes. 5ly This is the common mother of vs all, from whence, as from the Troian horse, innumerable troopes of men issued to people the other parts of the vnhabited world.
            Through this Country runneth the hill Taurus, which reckoning his seuerall bendings in and out, is 6250 miles long, and 375 broad. For it beginneth about Caria and Lycia in Anatolia, and is in diuerse places called by diuerse names, as Caueasus, Parapomisus, Niphates, Sarpedon, Periadres, Gordiaei, Anti Taurus, &c. Through this hill are three principall passages, viz: 1 Out of the rest of Anatolia into C
                     •
                  licia, called Pylae Ciliciae, of which more anon
                  •
                2ly Out of Scythia into Armenia, of which more at large when we come into that Country. and 3ly One of Scythia into Media, which are cal'd by reason of their neighbourhood to the Caspian Sea, Caspiae portae. These are the most

famous, containing eight miles in length, but for breadth scarce wide enough for a Cart to passe, and are supposed to haue been the worke of men rather then nature. The 2d mountaine of note is Imaus, which beginning in the shore of the North Ocean, & running directly towards the South, keepeth almost the same Meridian, viz: the longitude of 130 degrees, and crosseth the hill Taurus, euen in a manner at right angles. And as Taurus diuideth the North of Asia from the South; so doth this the East from the West: & maketh that ancient diuision of Scythia, into Scythia intra Imaum, and Scythia extra Imaum.
            
            The principall regions of Asia are 1 Anatolia. 2 Syria. 3 Palestina. 4 Armenia. 5 Arabia. 6 Media. 7 Assyria. 8 Mesopotamia. 9 Persia. 10 Chaldaea. 11 Parthia. 12 Hircania. 13 Tartaria. 14 China. 15 India. 16 The Ilands which lay dispersed either in the Indian Seas, or in the Mediterranean.
            
            
               ANATOLIA.
               
                  
                     Maginus
                  ANATOLIA is limited on the East with the riuer Euphrates; on the West with Thracius Bosphorus, Propontis, Hellespont, and the Aegean; on the North with Pontus Euxinus; on the South with the Rhodian and Lycian Seas.
               It was formerly called Asia Minor, to distinguish it from Asia the greater: but now Anatolia (and corruptly Natolia) from its more Easterne situation in respect of Greece 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . There is another Asia contained also in this Natolia called Asia Propria, and Asia 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which comprehendeth Caria, Ionia, Lydia, Aeolis, and both the Phrygia's. This is that Asia which is meant Act. 19.10. where it is said that all Asia heard the word of the Lord Iesus: and Act. 19.27. where it is said that all Asia and the world worsh
                        •
                     pped the Temple of Diana: neither of which places can be vnderstood either of Asia the greater, or of Anatolia, but of this only.
               This Country is situate vnder the fift and sixt Climats of the Northerne temperate Zone, the longest day being 15 houres & a halfe. It is adorned with many commodious Hauens, and was once of great fertility, but is now laid wast and desolate, greivously

lamenting the ruines of 4000 Citties and Townes.
               The people were once valiant and industrious, now so much addicted to a luxurious effeminacy, that the Turkes (vnlesse cō
                  strained by vrgent necessities) neuer inrole their children in the number of Ianizaries. Here once florished the faith of Christ, sealed by the blood of many of this nation. Here were the seaven Churches to which Iohn dedicated his Reuelation; 1 Ephesus, 2 Smyrna, 3 Thiatyra, 4 Laodicea, 5 Pergamus, 6 Philadelphia, 7 Sardis: All whose Candlesticks haue beene long since remoued, and now Mahumetisme hath so farre encroached on them, that few Christians remaine, and they which are, are of the Church and communion of Greece.
               
               This Region comprehendeth the seuerall Prouinces of Cilicia. 2 Pamphylia. 3 Lycia. 4 Caria. 5 Ionia. 6 Lydia. 7 Aeolis. 8

                  1. CILICIA.
                  On the South-east of Anatolia is CILICIA, watred with the riuer Cidnus, whose water proued very infectious to Alexander the Great; & deadly to the Emperour Fredericke the first, who was here drowned as he was bathing himselfe.
                  In this Province is the hill Anti-Taurus, in the straights of which mountaine called Pylae Ciliciae, was fought that memorable battaile, betwixt Seuerus and Pescenninus Niger, for the Monarchie of the world. Wherein the Nigrians being possessed of the entrance into the straights, manfully withstood the Seuerians, till at last a sudden tempest of raine and thunder, continually darting in their faces, the very heauens seeming to bee against them; they were compelled to leaue the passage, and the victory to the enimy, hauing lost 20000 of their fellow Souldiers. Nigh vnto this place Alexander with 30000 men, ouercame the Army of Darius king of Persia, consisting of 600000 Souldiers, whereof 110000 lost their liues. The chiefe Citties are Nicopolis, built by Alexander, in memory of his victory. 2 Pompeiopolis, built by Pompey the great, after his victory ouer the Pirats: who not only Lorded it ouer the Sea, but wasted &

spoiled the villages of Italie it selfe. Pompey being victor & having inflicted exemplary punishment on the ringleaders, with the rest peopled this new Towne and the Country adioyning; allowing them competent possessions, least want and necessity should againe enforce them to the like courses. An action truly commendable, and worthy so great a Captaine, rather to take occasion of offending from the people, then after offence done to punish them. Hythlodaeus in the Vtopia, somewhat bitterly, though perhaps not vniustly, inueigheth against our lawes, for ordaining death to be the guerdon for theft; Cùm multo potius providendum fuerit, vti aliquis esset prouentus vitae; ne cuipiam

                        it tam dira furandi primum, deinde pereundi necessitas. 3 Alexandria, built also by Alexander, and to distinguish it from Alexandria of Aegypt, called Alexandretta, and now Scanderone, a famous hauen. And 4 Tarsus, the birth-place of S. Paul, to which place Ionah intended to fly when he was sent to Niniueh. The inhabitants are giuen most to the pasturing of Goats of whose Fleeces they make their Chamblets: and to the keeping of horses, of which here is such store, that the Turkish Emperour culleth euery yeare from hence 600 horses of seruice.
               
               
                  2 PAMPHILIA.
                  On the West side of Cilicia lieth PAMPHILIA, watred with the riuers Melas and Oestros; whose chiefe Townes are Seleucia built by S

                        leucus, one of Alexanders successours. 2 Perga where Diana was worshipped, and 3 Faselis. The people of this Countrey, and of Cilicia, were called Soli, from whose barbarous kinde of pronunciation came the word Soloecismus. Amongst these Aratus was borne. In this Country is the riuer Eurymedon, in and nigh vnto which Simon the sonne of Miltiades, captaine generall of the Athenians, ouerthrew the sea and land forces of the Persians in one day. Hee tooke and sunke no fewer then 40 ships, and 300 Gallies in the sea-sight: which ended, he stowed the Persian ships with his best men attired in the h

                     bit, and wauing the colours of the Persians. Vpon their approach the Campe was opened, and all prepared to entertaine their victorious Countrimen. But the Greekes once in, suddenly put them to the sword, and tooke 20000 of them prisoners.
               
               
                  
                  3 LYCIA.
                  On the West side of Pamphilia is LYCIA, watred with the riuer Xanthus, of which the people hereabout were called Xanthi: who being too weak for Harpagus the Persian Kings Leiftenant, first burnt their wiues, children, seruants, and riches, and then made a sallie against Harpagus, who put them all to the Sword. They were called Lycij afterward from Lycus, sonne of Pandion. Before the Roman conquest this Prouince was gouerned by a common Councell of 23 men, culled out of their 23 Citties, of which the chiefe now is Patras. 2 Isaurus, which being brought vnder by Servilius, gaue him the surname of Isauricus. 3 Phaselis, a Towne as much enriched, & haunted by Pirats, as Algeirs is now adayes. This Towne was taken by the same Servilius, at what time Pompey scoured the Seas; whose victory ouer that rabble of pirats we cannot sufficiently admire, if either we consider the speedinesse, as gotten in little more thē a month; the easinesse, the Romans not loosing one vessell; or the euent, the Pirats after that time neuer infesting & troubling the Seas.
               
               
                  4 CARIA.
                  On the West side of Lycia is CARIA, so called from its king Cara, who first inuented the science of Diuination by the flying of Birds called Augurie. The people hereof were in former times accounted very valiant, and as saith Mela, Eò armorum pugnae

The chiefe Citties are Mindum, which being but a small Towne had great Gates, so that Diogenes the Cynicke cried out; Yee Cittizens of Mindum take heed your Citty runne not out of your Gates. 2 Halicarnassus, where Dionysius Halicarnasseus was borne, who writ the history of Rome for the first 300 yeares. The whole Prouince is in some approued Authors named

                     Halicarnassus: and Artemisia, who aided Xerxes against the Grecians, is called the Queene of Halicarnassus. This is she, who in the honour of her husband Mausolus, built that curious sepulchre, accounted one of the worlds wonders; it being 25 Cubits high, & supported with 36 curious pillars: of which Martial.

So that he might well say periissem nisi periissem. The King also was in a manner ouer-ioyed with his presence, as hauing (as he thought) on his side the man which had most hindred his conquest of all Gre

                  These 4 Countries are now called Caramania, from Caramon a Captaine of Aladine, the last Turkish King of the Zelzuccian familie: who after the decease of his Soueraigne, erected here a kingdome; which remained till Baiazet the second of the Oguzian or Ottomanicall family subverted it. It is now a Zanziack-ship, and yeeldeth to the great Turke 80000 Duckats yearely.
               
               
                  5 IONIA.
                  On the North side of Carta is IONIA, whose chiefe Citties are 1 Miletum, the birth-place of Thales and Anaximeres. 2 Smyrna. 3 Colophon, both which stroue for the birth of Homer, as also did fiue others.

For being sorely vext with famine iu the time of Atis one of the progenitours of Omphale, they deuised these games, & euery second day by playing at thē beguiled their hungry bellies. Thus for 22 yeares they cōtinued playing and eating by turnes; but then seeing that themselues were more fruitfull in getting and bearing children, then the soyle in bringing forth sustenance to maintaine them: they sent a Colonie into Italy vnder the conduct of Tyrrhenus the sonne of Atis, who planted in the Country, called at first Tyrrhenia, and afterward Tuscanie.
                  
                  This Country was also called Moeonia, and was thought to haue beene the birth-place of Homer, who is therefore called Moeonius vates, also Moeonides; and carmen Moeonium is vsed for Homers poeticall abilities, as carmine Moeonio consurgere in Ovid. Bacchus is also diuerse times called Maeonius, but for a different reason; because indeed here are in all this Country no trees but of Grapes.
                  The chiefe Citties are Sardis the royall seat of King Croesus. 2 Pergamus where King Attalus raigned, who made the Romans his heire: where parchment was inuented, and therefore

called Pergamenum: where Galen was borne, and liued healthfully 140 yeares: whereof he assigneth these reasons: He neuer eat or drunk his fill; 2ly he neuer eat any raw food; 3 he euer caried some sweet perfume with him. 3 Laodicea. 4 Theatyra. 5 Philadelphia.
                  
                  Of these Sardis was the strongest; and when it was once taken by the Grecians, Xerxes gaue commandment, that euery day at dinner one speaking alowd, should say, that the Grecians had taken Sardis. Such an order the French had in their Parliaments during the time that Calice was English; and it were not amisse if we vsed the same custome, till it be againe recouered.
                  
                     Lydia tooke its name, either from Lydus a Noblemā of great power: or from Lud the fourth sonne of Sem. It became to bee a Kingdome somewhat before the building of Rome, vnder one Ardisius, lineally descended from Hercules, and Omphale; who was once Queene of Lydia: but after the kingdome decayed, & now was restored.

                     4 Candaules, who shewing his wife naked to Giges, was by him slaine, who marrying his wife succeeded him in the kingdome. 17. The whole story is this. Candaules had to his wife a woman of vnparallel'd beauty; and supposing the greatnesse of his happinesse, not to consist so much in his owne fruition, as the notice which others might take of it; intended to shew her in natures brauery to Giges the master of his heards. Giges at first disswaded him from an attempt so foolish; but seeing no perswasion could prevaile, he condescended. When hee had seene the naked Queene, and was ready to depart, Candaules cryed to him Esto fidelis, Giges: which words the Queene marking, and seeing the backe of Giges as he left the chamber, the next morning sent for him. When holding a ponyard in her hand, she gaue him this choice, either presently to be slaine, or else to kill the King and take her to wife, with

the kingdome for her dowre. He made choice of this latter euill, and killed the foolish Candaules.

The chiefe Citty was Lampsacus, where the beastly God Priapus, was worshipped in as beastly a manner and forme. It is recorded that when Alexander was in Asia, hee intended vtterly to raze this Citty; and seeing Anaximenes come to him as an Embassadour from the Towne, bad him be silent, and swore vnto him he would deny whatsoeuer he requested: wherevpon Anaximenes intreated him to destroy the Citty, which for his oathes sake he could not doe; and so Lampsacus at that time escaped. 2 Cyzicus.

                     Ilium, or Troy, a famous Towne, from the people whereof, all nations desire to fetch their originall. The beauty of it may be (as some write) yet seene in the ruines, which with a kinde of Maiestie entertain the beholders, the wals of large circuit, consisting of a black hard stone cut foure-square: some remnants of the Turrets which stood on the wals, and the fragments of great marble tombes and monuments of curious workmanship. But certainly these are not the ruines of that Ilium, which was destroyed by the Grecians, but another of the same name, built some foure miles from the situation of the old, by Lysimachus one of Alexanders Captaines, who peopled it from the neighbouring Citties. Now concerning old Ilium and the fall thereof, take with you this epitomated story.

                        And the soyle's fatted with the Phrygian blood.
                     
Concerning the taking of this Towne, two things are considerable. First whether the Grecians in these ten yeares lay continually before it; and it seemes they did not: but that rather they did beat vp and downe, wasting the Country, and robbing the Seas for the first nine yeares, and in the tenth only laid a formall siege. This is the more probable, because that in the tenth yeare of the warre, Priam is recorded by Homer in the 3d of his Iliads to haue sate on a high Tower, and learned of Helen the names and qualities of the Greeke commanders: which hee could not be thought ignorant of, if they had for so long together layne in eye-reach. Secondly by what meanes the Towne was taken; and here we finde a difference: for some historians tell vs that Aeneas and Antenor betrayed it to the enimy: but this Virgil could not brooke, as preiudiciall to his Aeneas, whom he intended to make the patterne of a compleat Prince. Hee t
                        •
                     erefore telleth vs of a wooden horse wherein diuers of the Greek Princes lay hiddē; which by Sinon, one of the Grecians, was brought to Troy gates; and that the people desirous of that monument of the enimies flight, made a breach in their wals▪ the gate not being high enough to receaue it. That this fiction of Virgil might be grounded on history, it is thought by some that ouer

the Scaean gate where the Greekes entred, was the picture of a large and stately horse: and by others, that the walls were battered by a wooden engine called a horse, as the Romans in after times vsed a like engine called a R
                           •
                        mme. Neither of these is much improbable, but with me they perswade not the integrity of Antenor and Aeneas.
                  
                  This Province together with Aeolis and part of Lydia, are now called Carausia, from Carasus a Turkish Captain; who after the death of Aladine the last Turkish Sultan of the Zelzuccian Tribe, here erected a petty kingdome, long since swallowed by the Ottoman Emperours.
               
               
                  9 PHRYGIA MAIOR.
                  On the East side of Phrygia minor is PHRYGIA MAIOR, watred with the riuers Sangarius and Marsyas; this latter being so called from one Marsyas, who striuing with Apollo for preheminence in Musicke, was by him stead: which fact (say the Poets) was so lamented, that from the teares of the mourners grew this riuer. The chiefe Townes are 1 Gordion the seat of Gordius, who from a plowman being raised and chosen King of this kingdome, placed the furniture of his waine and Oxen in the Temple of Apollo; tie

                        a Pesinuntia. The Romans were once told by an oracle, that they should bee Lords of the world if they could get this Goddesse. Herevpon they send to the Phrygians to demand it. The Phrygians willing to please a potent neighbour, especially the Romans being their Countrymen, as descended from Aeneas and his Troians:

granted their request, and the Goddesse is shipt for Rome. But behold the vnluckinesse of fortune. The ship, Goddesse, and all made a stand in Tiber, neither could it be againe moued forward by force or sleight. It hapned that one Claudia a Vestall virgin being suspected of incontinency, tied her girdle vnto it; praying the Goddesse, that if she were causelesly suspected, she would suffer the ship to goe forward, which was no sooner said then granted; Claudia by her girdle drawing the ship vp the streame to Rome, where I leaue the people wondring at the miracle.
                  The Phrygians were by Psamniticus King of Aegypt, accoū
                     ted the ancientest people of the world, & that forsooth on this wise experiment. Psamniticus desirous to knowe to whom the greatest antiquity of right belonged, caused two children to be shut vp in a

                     old, where they were suckled by Goats, al humane company being on a great penalty prohibited to visit them. All the language which the children had learned of the Goats their nurses was Bec; which with the Phrygians signifying bread, and in no other tongue, as it seemeth, bearing any signification at al, gaue the verdict on their side: but as it appeares the other nations of the world not yeelding to this sentence, by a writ of Ad melius inquirendum, impannelled a new Iury, wherein it was pronounced that Scytharum gens semper erat antiquissima. In this kingdome raigned Niobe, who preferring her selfe before Latona, had all her children slaine before her face, and shee her selfe was turned to a stone. Here also raigned Tantalus, who being rich & wāting wit to vse his prosperity, is fained to stand in hell vp to the chinne in water, and vnder a tree whose apples touch his lips; yet both the one and the other flie from him, of which thus Ovid,

This Country together with the other part of Lydia, was once the Territory of the Aidinian Kings, so called from Aidin, another Turkish Captaine; who after the death of Aladine possessed

these parts with the title of King; long since ouerthrowne by the Ottoman Familie.

For what cause this most excellent Poet was banished, is not yet agreed on. Some say it was for the vnlawfull pleasures, which he enioyed with Iulia, Augustus daughter; whom, in his Amorum, he celebrateth vnder the borrowed name of Corinna. Others imagine, that he had seene Augustus himselfe vnnaturally vsing the company of the same Iulia, his daughter; for which the offended Prince banished him: to which, it is thought he alluded, in his booke de Tristibus, where he saith, Cur aliquid vidi, cur nexia lumina feci? &c.

Sylla, Lucullus, & Pompey the great, three of the greatest Souldiers that euer the Roman Empire knewe: yet did not the Roman puissance so much plucke downe his prowd heart, as the rebellion of his son Pharnaces against him; which he no sooner heard, but he would haue poysoned himselfe: but hauing formerly so vsed his body to a kinde of poyson allaid (which from his inuenting of it we now call Mithridate) that the venome could not worke vpon him, he slew himselfe. He is said to haue beene an excellent Scholler, and to haue spoken perfectly the languages of 22 nations. After his death the Romanes easily recouered their own, & made that kingdome a Prouince of their Empire.

                  On the Southside of Paphlagonia is GALLATIA, so called of the Gaules, who here planted themselues vnder the leading of Brennus: to the people of this Prouince did S.

                  The people hereof were Gaules only in name, retaining little in them of their Ancestours valour. For as the plants and trees loose much of their vertue, being transplanted into another soyle; so these men lost their natiue courage, strength, and hardinesse, being weakned by the Asian pleasures and delicacies. So as Tully saith, for a man to be good in other places, is no masterie; but in Asia to lead a temperate life, is indeed praise-worthy. So might one haue said to the Gaules: To be couragious & patient of trauell among the mountaines, was no whit admired; but to haue continued so amidst the delights of Asia, had bin indeed meritorious. But these men were so farre from assailing the Romans in the Ca

                  On the East side of Lycaonia is PISIDIA, whose cities are Antiochia and Lisinia. The people of this Country hauing offended Cyrus the brother of Artaxerxes Mnemon, gaue him good occasion to leuie an Army, pretending revenge on them; but intending to dispossesse his brother of the Persian Monarchie. But Tisaphernes, Lieftenant for the King in Asia, seeing greater preparations then were sufficient, to oppresse the weak Pisidians, made the King acquainted with his suspicions, who accordingly prouided for resistance. Cyrus Army consisted of 12000 Grecians, and 100000 Persians: the Kings forces were no fewer then 9000000 fighting men. They meet at Cunaxa not farre from Babylon, where Cyrus lost both the victory & his life. The Grecians who had made their side good, and stood on termes of honourable composition, being by Tisaphernes betrayed, lost the best of their company. The rest vnder the conduct of Xenophon, made a safe retreit home, in despite of 200000 men, which followed at their heeles. This Xenophon was an agent in, and the historian of this expedition, by whose example the Spartans, and after them the Macedonians, first attempted the conquest of Persia. Eastward from Pisidia is ARMENIA MINOR, which by some is thought to be the Land of Ararat, on whose mountaines the Arke rested, the Remnants of which, Iosephus saith, were in his time to be seene. The chiefe town is Melexona, whose territory is abundant in oile and wine.

taken from them by the Grecians, vnder the prosperous ensignes of victorious Alexander. After his decease, the Empire being diuided among his Captaines: Asia fell to the share of Antigonus; whose son Demetrius seised on the kingdome of Macedonia, and left Asia, subdued by Seleucus Nicanor K. of Syria & the East, being also one of Alexanders heires. The sixt from this Seleucus, was Antiochus, called the Great; who waging warre with yong Ptolomy Philopater, King of Egypt, committed by his father to the protection of the Romanes, prouoked the Senate of Rome to send Scipio (surnamed for his Asian victories) Asiaticus, against him; who compelled him to forsake Asia, which the Romans presently took into their possession. Other motiues there were to cause this warre; as that Antiochus entertained Annibal, being a professed enemy to the state of Rome; that he demanded restitution of the City Lysimachia, possessed by the Romans; that he had took into his protection Thoas, a Prince of Aetolia, revolted from the seruice of their state; but chiefly that the Romans by the ouerthrow of a King so potent, might adde to their fame and Dominion. Vnder the Romans this prouince long continued, till the Turkes by little and little, wrested it from the Empire of Greece, and subdued it to their Mahumetan superstition.

The white turbant they weare like the Turks; circumcision they abhor; from wine they refraine not, & account it lawful most vnlawfully to marry with their own daughters. They are a people very warlike, stoue, and resolute; and haue with great valour resisted all the attempts and warres of the Turkish Sultans. The country which they possesse, is environed with the confines of Ioppa aboue Caesarea and Palestine; and within the riuers of Iordan & Orontes, stretching it selfe euen to the plaines of Damasco. They were in the time of Amurath the 3d, gouerned by 5 Emirs or Princes, one of which was ManOgli, who so resolutely resisted Ibrahim Bassa, Anno 1585. This Man-Ogli then kept his Court and

residence at Andirene a strong place situate on a hill, and was of that wealth, that he sent to make his peace vnto the aboue-named Ibrahim, 320 Arcubuses, 20 packs Andirene silkes, and 50000 Duckats; At a second time he presented him with 50000 duckats more, 480 arcubuses, 1000 goats, 150 Camels, 150 Buffes, 1000 Oxen, and 200 weathers; by which rich gifts we may not a little coniecture at the revenue of the present Emir of S

Here was once a kingdome of great antiquity, and long continuance; the most famous of her kings were Hyram, in a strict bond and confederacie with Salomon: & Pigmaleon the brother of Dido,

This gaue way to the Persian Monarchy, and after the ouerthrow of Darius, was beleagured by Alexander, who with great expence of men and mony, together with extraordinary labour & toile, at last took it. This rendition of the town was diuined by the Soothsayers which followed the camp of Alexander, vpon a dreame which he not long before had.

               The second Prouince of Syria is CAELOSYRIA, whose chiefe cities are 1 Hieropolis, famous for the Temple and worship of the Syrian goddesse; the tricks and iugglings of whose

Priests to deceiue the silly people, who list to see; may find them abundantly described in the Metamorphosis of Apuleius: the relation whereof seemeth to be a discourse of the tricks of legerdemaine, which the Friers and Pardoners at this day vse in the Papacie. 2 Damascus so pleasantly situate, that the impostor Mahomet would neuer enter into it; fearing (as himselfe vsed to say) lest being ravished with the ineffable pleasures of the place, he should forget the busines about which he was sent; & make this town his Paradise. For it is seated in a very fruitfull soyle, bearing grapes all the yeare, and girt round about with most curious and odoriferous gardens. This town is famous for her founders, being Abrahams seruants; for the tomb of Zacharias; and for the conversion of Paul, who here first preached the Gospell, and scaped the snares of his enemies, being let down the walls of the house by a basket: The Syrian kings mentioned in the Bible, were of this Syria, as Benhadad &c.
               The third Prouince is SYRO-PHOENICIA, whose chief cities are 1 Beritus a famous mart-town, formerly called Iulia faelix, and now Barutti; nigh vnto which, St 
                  George deliuered the Kings daughter, by killing of the Dragon. In memory of which exploit, there was a castle & an oratory built in the same place and consecrated to S. George, by whose name the valley adjoyning is yet called. 2 Aleppo, so called of Alep, which signifieth milke, which here is in great plentyl it is called in the Scriptures Aram Sobab, 2 Sam. 8.3. This town is famous for a wonderfull confluence of Marchants from all parts, who come hither to traffique. 3 Biblis. 4 Tripolis, so call'd because it hath bin thrice built: and 5 Antiochia, built and named by Antiochus her founder. Two things doth this city glory in; first that she is the Metropolis of all Syria; & therfore Hadrian being offended with the citizens hereof, intended to haue separated Phoenicia from Syria; Ne tot civitatum metropolis Antiochia diceretur (saith Gallicanus.) Secondly, because the Disciples of IESVS were here first called Christians; a people by the Heathen so hated, that they ceased not to malice and slander them continually, as men that at their devout meetings devoured infants, and had carnal company with their mothers and sisters. Among the rest, Tacitus hath shot his sooles bolt, calling

them, homines per flagitia invisos, & noviffima exempla meritos. Yet this defamation notwithstanding, they grew in 40 yeares to that number, that they were a terrour to their enemies; who suggested by that old enemy of piety, the Diuell, grieuously afflicted them with ten generall persecutions vnder the Emperours, 1 Nero, Ao 67. 2 Domitianus, Ao 96. 3 Traianus, Ao 100. 4 Marcus Antoninus, Ao 167. 5 Severus, Ao 195. 6 Maximinus, Ao 137. 7 Decius Ao 250. 8 Valerianus, Ao 259. 9 Aurelianus, Ao 278. 10 Dioclesianus, Ao 293. These persecutions were so cruell, that S. Hierom writeth in one of his Epistles, that euery day in the yeare there were murthered 5000, excepting only the first day of Ianuary: But sanguis martyrum, semen Ecclesiae; and this little grain of mustard seed, planted by Gods own hand, and watred with the blood of so many holy men, grew so great a tree, that it dispersed its branches through euery Prouince & city of the World. Neither were the Imperial armies without a wonderfull number of them, as appeared when Iulian the Rennegate hauing vomited out his soule with a Vicistitandem Galile: They elected Iovinianus Emperor, with this joyfull acclamation, Christiani omnes sumus. Constantine the Great, put an end to all persecutions, & embraced the Christian Faith on this occasion. At the same time that Constantine was appointed Emperour in Brittaine. Maxentius was by the Praetorian souldiers chosen at Rome; and Lycinus nominated successour by Maximinus. Against these, Constantine marching, and being in his mind somwhat pensiue, he cast his eyes vp to Hea

Constantine obeyeth the vision, and is accordingly victorious. After this he not only fauoured the Christians, but became one of that holy profession. This is the story according to Soc

                     ates Scholasticus, who writes, that the banner was in his time reserued in the Emperours palace. But Zozimus an Heathen historian, partly vpon malice to the Christians in generall,

and partly on a particular grudge to this Emperour, of whom he neuer speaketh well, deliuereth the cause of his conversion farre otherwise. Questionlesse he was a great instrument of Gods glory; In whose time God gaue such increase to his Gospell, that at last it got the vpper hand of Heathenisme: And here flourished, till the sins of the people prouoked God to remoue his Candle-stick from those places, and leaue them as a prey to misbeleeuers and Idolaters.
               In Syria also was the town and Prouince of Palmyra, famous in that it was vnder the gouernment of Zenobia; a woman of such worth, that she was counted worthy the purple roabe, and to stand in opposition with Gallienus for the Empire of the world. She swayed these Easterne parts during the reigne of Gallienus, Claudius, Quintilius, and Aurelian: who taking her prisoner, led her in triumph through Rome, ita ut eâ specie nihil unquam esset pompabilius.
               
               The Syrians are called in the Bible Aramites, who were an obscure people subiect to the Persians, & subdued by Alexander the Great; after whose death, this Country, together with Persia, & other adjacent Prouinces, fell to the share of Seleucus Nicanor, a man strangely preferred. For being at the first, Gouernour of Chaldea only, he was forced to leaue Babylon, and forsake his Prouince, for feare of Antigonus, then dreadfull to all the Macedonian Captaines; and to fly into Egypt, where he became Ptolomies Admirall. After, Ptolomie fighting a pitched field with Demetrius, son to Antigonus, took Seleucus with him; and hauing wonne the battaile, gaue him aid and licence to recouer his former gouernment. Seleucus welbeloued of the people, soon made himself Master, not of Chaldea only, but of all the Persian Prouinces beyond Euphrates, & not long after (being seconded by his good friend Ptolomie, Cassander, & Lysimachus) he encountred Antigonus at Ipsus in Cilicia, where Antigonus himself was slain, & his whole Army routed. This victory made Seleucus Lord of all Asia; from whence passing ouer into Europe, he vanquished and slew Lysimachus: seauen moneths after which victory, he was slain by Ptolomie Ceraunus, whose patron and protectour he was: being yet the last surviuour

of all Alexanders Princes, and the only possessour of all the Dominions which his Master had, either by inheritance, or conquest. His successours although they were Lords of all Asia, yet since in Syria they kept their residence, were commonly called Kings of Syria.

Finally, being again broken and vanquished by Lucullus, he yeelded himself to Pompey, who being appointed Lucullus successour, depriued him of the honour of ending that warre; & retaining to himself Armenia and Media only, he left all Syria to the Romans, hauing raigned 18 yeares: The gouernment of this Country vnder these new Lords, was accounted to be one of the greatest honours of the Empire; the Praefect here of hauing almost regall iurisdiction ouer all regions on this side Euphrates, with a superintendencie ouer Egypt. Niger the concurrent of Severus, was Praefect here; and also Cassius Syrus, who being a natiue of this Country, and welbeloued by reason of his moderate & plausible demeanour, had almost tumbled M. Antoninus out of his Throne. On this occasion it was enacted by the Senate, that no man hereafter should haue any militar or legall command in the Prouince, where he was borne: Lest perhaps supported by the naturall propension of the people, one of their own Nation; and hartned by the powerablenesse of his friends, he might appropriate it to himself, which was common to the Senate and people of Rome. From the Romans this Prouince, and Palestine (as we shall presently shew you) were extorted by the Saracens.

Their Religion in its purity was first taught by diuine inspiration; afterward published in the two Tables of the Law at mount Sinai; but now they haue added their own inventions, giuing as much credit to the Talmud, as to the Scriptures. They were of 3 sorts or sects; 1 Iewes, 2 Samaritans, 3 Proselites. The first were of the naturall language, and originall of the Tribes: the second were such as Salmanasser placed in Samaria, from whence he carried the Israelites captiues; these retained only the fiue bookes of Moses: the third were such as came from other Countries to learne the Religion of the Iewes. They were subdiuided also into other sects, as Pharises, Sadduces, Esseni, a

was double; 1 to read & expoūd the Law in the Temple & Synagogues: & 2ly to execute the office of a Iudge, in ending and composing actions. The Esseui are so called from Ascha, that is, facere; because they wrought with their hands. They liued together, as it were, in Colledges, and in euery one had their

The Sadduces deriue their name either from Sado

They belieued not the being of Angels or spirits, the resurrection of the body, & that there was a Holy Ghost, they credited not, they receiued only the Pentateuch, and in many other things agreed with the Samaritans. The Pharisees owe their name to Phares, which signifieth both interpretari & separare, as being both interpreters of the Law, and separatists from the rest of the Iewish Church. They held the contrary opinions to the Sadduces, and besides the Pentateuch, or fiue bookes of Moses, adhered also vnto traditions. They denied also the sacred Trinity; they held the fulfilling of the Law to consist in the outward ceremonies; they relyed more on their own merits, then Gods mercy; they attributed most things to destiny; & refused commerce with Publicans & sinners. Their Philacteries were broad scrolls of parchment bound about their heads, wherein were written the 10 Commandements, vainly so interpreting that of De

               This Country hath had diuers diuisions; as first into the seuerall Nations of the Amorites, Perezites, Philistines, &c. After the conquest of these people, it was diuided between the people of Israel into 12 Tribes, as the Tribe of Iuda, Beniamin, Ephraim, &c. When Ieroboam had made that great breach in the kingdome of Dauid, it was diuided into the kingdomes of Iuda and Israel: of which the former contained only the two Tribes of Iuda and Beniamin; the latter the other ten.

In the Tribe of Napthalim the principall townes are and were, Iabin where the 24 Kings met to giue battle to Ioshua: to the King of this Towne also was Sisera Leiftenant, who was ouerthrowne by Debora, and slaine by Iael. It was also called Hazor. 2 Capernaum (seated on the influxe of Iordan into the Sea of Galilie) so often mentioned in the Scriptures.

                  3 Cinnereth called afterward Genesareth, whence the Lake or Sea of Galile is called the Lake of Genesareth. That the children of Dan were here in part seated is easily prooued out of Ioshua, the 19. and 47 vers. where it is said that the coast of the children of Dan being too little for them they went vp, and fought against Leshem, which they tooke and called Dan. This Leshem, is rendred by some interpreters Laish, and is the place where Abraham vanquished Chedorla

               The Lower Galile containeth the Tribes of Zabulon, and Isachar. In the Tribe of Zabulon, the chiefe Citties are or were Gaba, called since Hippopolus, of a regiment of horse, there garisond by Herod. 2 Cana where our Sauiour wrought his first miracle, turning water into wine. 3 Bethsaida, the birth-place of Peter, Andrew, and Philip. 4 Tiberias on the Sea of Galile, which is also called the Lake of Tiberias. In this Citty was Mathew called, and the daughter of Iairus raised from death to life. 5 Sephoris made by Herod Antipas the regall seat of the Lower Galilea. and 6 Nazareth, where Mary was saluted with those ioyfull tidings by an Angell as she sate in her chamber. Of this chā
                  ber I cannot but insert this famous legend. It was after the virgins death had in great reuerence by the Christians, and remained in this towne till the Holy-land was by the Turkes and Saracens subdued Anno 1291. Then was it most miraculously transported into Sclauonia; but that place being vnworthy of the Virgins diuine presence, it was by the Angells carried ouer into the sea coast of Italy Anno 1294. That place also being infected with theeues and pirats, the Angells remoued it to the little village of Loretto, where her miracles were quickly divulged: Insomuch that Paul the 2d built a most stately Church over this Chamber; and Xistus the fift made the Village a Citty. And thus we haue the beginning of our Lady of Loretto. Here is in this Tribe also the brooke Chison, and mount Tabor, where

Christ was transfigured. Here also is the high seated Citty of Iotapata, which Iosephus the historian, being gouernour of both Galilies, so brauely defended against Vespasian. In the Tribe of Isachar the chiefe Citties are Tarichaea with great difficulty taken in the Iewish warres. 2 Enhadda, nigh vnto which Saul slew himselfe, and 3 Daberoth, seated in the valley of Israel: a valley famous for the many battails fought in it. As of Gedeon against the Madianites; Saul against the Philistines; Ahab against the Syrians; the Christians against the Sarracens; and Iohn against Iehoram. In this Lower Galile was our Saviour very conuersant, wherefore Iulian the Apostata called him a Galilean.
               
               2 SAMARIA is not here taken in that large extent by which it comprehended the kingdome of the ten Tribes; but in a stricter limit for that part of Palestine which is seated between Iudaea and Galilie. The people hereof were as we haue said the discendants of such Assyrians, as were by Salmanassar sent hither to possesse the inheritance of the captiue Israelites. They were to the Iewes in their aduersity most deadly enimies: but when God had giuen them rest and felicity, who but the Iewes shalbe their Cosens. This hollow-hearted dealing so offended the Iews that they reputed the Samaritans for reprobates and schismatickes. So that when they went about to calumniate our blessed Sauiour, they could finde no more grieuous reproach, then to say he was a Samaritan, or (as if they had beene alone) one that conuersed with Diuells. And though the Iewes would not vouchsafe to marry with them, yet they inhabited most of their good Townes; some of which they had totally wrested into their owne hands: in the others they were mingled. This Province of Samaria comprehended the Tribes of Ephraim, Gad, Ruben; and the two halfe Tribes of Manasses; the one situate on the Mediterranean, the other beyond Iordan. In the halfe Tribe of Manasses on the Mediterranean, the chiefe Citties are Bethsan, which being growne old, was by the Scythians at their irruptions into Asia the lesse, reedified, and named Scythopolis. On the walls hereof did the Philistines hang the bodies of Saul and his sonnes. 2 Thebes where the bastard Abimelec was woū

Here Paul disputed against Tertullus, in the presence of Festus the Roman President: here Cornelius was baptised by Peter: & here Herod Agrippa was smitten by an Angell, and eaten of wormes; after his rhetoricall Oration, which the people called the voice of God & not of man. 7 Antipatris, whether the Souldiers lead Paule by the command of Lysias. 8 Megiddo, &c.

It hath beene also in the time of the Roman Monarchy called Trachonitis, because it is bounded Eastward with the hills of Gilead, which the Cosmographers of that age called Trachones. Some also call it Iturea, but improperly: for Iturea was seated more toward Syro-Phoenicia & North to Damascus, and was so called from Ietur one of the sonnes of Ismael. It was also a part of the Country of Decapolis, so named of ten prime Citties in it, which extended from Bethsan South, to Libanus North; from the mountaines of Gilead East, to the Mediterranean West. Of this Decapolis wee finde frequent mention in the new Testament, as Math. 4.25. Mark. 7.31. &c. Thus hauing cleered my passage in respect of the diuersitie of names. I will proceed to the Citties: The chiefe whereof are Butis, Berenice, or Pella demolished by Alexander Iannaeus King of the Iewes. 2 Edrey, the royall seat of Og King of Basan. 3 Astaroth sometimes peopled with Giants, for which cause the Country adioyning is tearmed the Region of Giants. Here Astoreth the Goddesse of the Zidonians was worshipped in the forme of a Sheep. 4 Gaulon where the sect of the Gaulonites began, and 5 Hus, the birth-place of Iob. The chiefe Citties of the Gadites are Gadara & Gergesa, the people whereof intreated our Sauiour to depart frō their coasts: for to both these people the story is attributed: by Mathew to the last; by Luke and Marke to the first: not that they were both one, but because they were neighbour Citties, and so their bounds confounded. 3 Iab

At the siege of this Towne, that most excellent and politique

Captaine Ioab hauing brought it to tearmes of yeelding, sent for the King to haue the honour of taking in so defersible a City. In the Tribe of Reuben the chiefe Citties are 1 Machaerus an exceeding strong Citty, standing vpon so high a rocke that it is euery way inaccessible. In this town Iohn the Baptist was slain. 2 Beth Bara where Iohn baptized, and where Moses made his diuine exhortations to the people, 3 Abel-Sittim seated in the Country called the plaines of Moab. This was the last encamping place of the Israelites vnder Moses. It was after called simply Sittim, and yeelded the wood so often mentioned in the Scripture whereof the Arke was made. 4 Ramath Baal, to which place Balack brought Balaam to curse the people. This was the chiefe Citty of the worshippers of Baal; which was, as some say, the same with Priapus.
               
               IDVMEA, was the habitation of the Edomites, the of-spring of Esau, who also inhabited the Country South of Israel, called Mount Seir, or the wildernesse of Edom; in which the children of Israel were stung with the fiery Serpents; and which is counted a part of Arabia the stonie. This Idumea of which we treat, was not wholy in the hands of the Edomites, but possessed in part by the Philistines, a people which of all other most vexed the Israelites, and kept them in that bondage, that they left thē not a Smith in any of their Citties and Townes to sharpen their irons with. These Philistines together with the Edomites were by King Dauid made subiect, but neuer could they be expelled the land. In the raigne of King Ioram, we finde how the Philistines brake into Iuda, ransacked the Kings pallace, and tooke prisoners his wife and children. What was the end of this nation, I as yet knowe not; this I answere, that for the puissance of this people, the whole Country was by heathen writers tearmed Palestine. In the raigne of King Ioram, also the Edomits revolted; and continued in that free state till the time of Hireanus the high Priest: who taking most of their Townes, made them subiect to the Iewes, compelled them to be circumcised, & from thenceforth they were reputed as Iewes. This Country of Idumea contained the Tribes of Dan, and Simeon. The chiefe Citties of the Tribe of Dan are Ioppe (now Iaffa) a famous Mart

Towne, where Ionah tooke ship to fly vnto Tarsus; where Peter raised Dorcas from death to life; and where he lying at the house of Simon a Tanner, was in a vision taught the conuersion of the Gentiles. This Citty they report to haue beene built before the flood; and here they say raigned Cepheus, whose daughter Andromeda was by Perseus deliuered from the sea-monster; some of whose bones the people vsed to shew to strangers euen till the flourishing of the Romans.

The chiefe Citties of Simeon, are 1 Ascalon where Semiramis was borne; so also was Herod that killed the infants; who comming to be King of the Iewes, verified the prophecy of Isaak to his sonne Esau: that the children of Esau should not only breake the yoke of Iacob from off their neck, for that hapned vnder Ioram; but should also haue dominion ouer them, which was now fulfilled. 2 Gaza an exceeding faire and strong Towne, in which the Persians did lay the tributes and customes of these Westerne Provinces; from whence all riches & treasures are also called Gaza. 3 Cariaths

               IVDAEA is of the same extent now, as it was when it was

the kingdome of Iuda, containing the two great and puissant Tribes of Iuda, and Beniamin. The chiefe Citties in the Tribe of Iudah are Arad situate in the entrance from the Wildernesse of Ed

Nere vnto this Towne Iudas Maccabaeus ouerthrew Gorgias. 5 Emaus, nigh vnto which Iudas Maccabaeus (after he had formerly beaten Apollonius) gaue Gorgias the third ouerthrow. Here our Redeemer shewed himselfe after his resurrection to two of his Disciples: it was afterward called Nicopolis. 6 Hebron one of the ancientest Citties of Canaan. It was the seat of the Giants called Anakim, or the sonnes of Anak. This word Anak signifyeth a chaine worne for ornament; and it seemeth that this Anak enriched with the spoiles of their enimies, wore a chaine of gold; leauing both the custome and name to his posterity. We read the like of Manlius Torquatus in the Romane histories. This Towne did Abraham buy for a buriall place for his dead, and in it his wife Sarah was first buried; and after her, foure of the Patriarchs. Adioyning to this Town is the plaine of Mamr

                   where Abraham the father of the faithfull sitting in his Tent, was visited from heauen by God in the shape of a man. Here Dauid kept his Court before the winning of Ierusalem; to this place came the Tribes to anoynt him King ouer Israel; and hither came Absalom vnder the pretence of paying his vowes, to vsurp the kingdome of his father. 7 Tecoa, the Citty of Amos the Prophet; as also of that woman, who by the words which Ioab put into her mouth, perswaded the King to call Absolon from exile. In the Wildernesse of Tecoa, there assembled the inhabitants of Moab, Ammon, and Mount Seir, to ouerthrow Iuda. But the Lord being appeased by the publique fast, proclaimed and kept by Iehosophat and the people, sowed dissentions amongst them; So that the children of Ammon and Moab stood vp against the inhabitants of mount Seir vtterly to slay & destroy

them; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another. 8 Libna, a Citty seated in a corner of Iuda, running betweene the Tribes of Dan and Beniamin. This Citty revolted from Ioram King of Iudah, at the same time the Edomites did: and continued a free state euen as long as Iudah continued a kingdome. 9. Ziph, in the Wildernes whereof Dauid hid himselfe from the fury of Saul. Hither when Saul persued him, Dauid came into his Camp (the watch being all a sleep) and tooke thence his speare, and a Cruse of oyle, & departed. Abishay would faine haue killed him; but Dauid though he knew that Samuel had ministerially abdicated Saul from the kingdome, and that himselfe was appointed in his steed; would not touch him, but left him to the iudgements of the Lord▪ whose annointed he was. 10 Bethlem, or (to distinguish it from another of this name in Zabulon, called) Bethlem Iudae, where Christ was borne; and the innocent suffered for him, before hee had suffered for them. In this generall Massacre of young children, a sonne of Herods which was at nurse, was also slaine. Which being told vnto Augustus, he replied, he had rather be

On the frontire of this Country towards the Philistines, was that strong Castle, which Herod repayring called Herodium; It was seated on a hill, the ascent vnto which, was made with 200 steps of marble exceeding faire and large. In this Country also, are the hills of Engaddi, in a Caue of which Dauid cut off the lap of Sauls garment; and all along the bottome whereof were the gardens of Balsamum or Opobalsamum: the trees of which were by Cleopatra (at such time as she gouern'd M. Antonie and the East) sent for to be replanted in Heliopolis of Aegypt; & Herod, who durst not deny them, plucked them vp by the roots and sent them to her.
               In the Tribe of Beniamin, the chiefe cities are 1 Gilgal where Ioshua first did eat of the fruits of the land; where he circumcised such of the people as were borne in the perābulation of the Wildernesse, where he kept the Passouer; nigh to which he pitched vp the 12 stones as a memoriall to posterity, that the waters of Iordan had diuided thēselues to giue passage to the children of Israel; and where Agag King of the Amalekites was

hewne in peeces by Samuel. 2 Mispah famous in being the ordinary place of assembly for the whole body of the people, in matters of warre or peace; as also in that standing in the midst of Canaan, it was (together with Gilgal) made the seat of iustice, to which Samuel went yearely to giue iudgement to the people. 3 Gebah the North border of the kingdome of Iuda, toward Israel. 4 Gibba, where the abusing of the Levites wife by the young men of this towne; had almost rooted the Tribe of Beniamin out of the garden of Is

Saul about 400 yeares after slew some of them, for which fact the Lord caused a famine of the land, which could not be taken away till seuen of Sauls sonnes were by Dauid deliuered vnto the Gibeonites, and by them hanged. This famine did God send, because in killing these poore Gibeonites, the oath was broken, which Iosuah and the Princes swore concerning them. 7 Iericho de
                     •
                  troyed by the sounding of Rammes hornes, was not only leueld by Iosuah to the ground, but a curse inflicted on him that should attempt the building of it. This curse notwithstanding, at the time whē 
                  Ahab raigned in Israel, which was about 500 yeares from the ruine of it; Hiel a Bethelite, delighted with the pleasantnes of the place reedified it. But (as it was foretold by Iosuah) as he laid the foundation of the walls, he lost his eldest sonne; and when he had finished it, and was setting vp the gates thereof, he lost also his yongest. It may bee Hiel when he began this worke minded, not the prophecy; it may be he beleeued it not: peraduenture he thought the words of Iosuah not so much to proceed from the spirit of prophecie, as from an angry and vexed heart; they being spoken in way of wish or execration. And it is possible, it may be he chose rather to build the eternity of his name, vpon so pleasing and stately a Citty; then on the liues and issue of two young men. Ouer against

this Iericho on the other side of Iordan, are the mountains of Nebo, on which the Lord shewed vnto Moses the Country which he had promised to the posterity of Iacob. 10 HIERVSALEM the Citty of the Lord, built by Mel

This Citty was strongly seated on the mount Sion, and strengthned with a ditch cut out of the maine rock, which was in depth 60, and in bredth 250 foot. It continued vnconquered for the first 400 yeares after the entrance of the children of Israel; & when Dauid attēpted it; the people presumed so much on the strength of the place, that they told him their blind and lame could desend it against him. Notwithstanding Dauid by the valour of Ioab, that fortunate and couragious leader, carried the town, & made it the seat royall of the Kings of Iuda. Here was the most glorious and magnificent Temple built by Solomon, in prouiding the materials whereof, there were 30000 workmē, which wrought by the 10000 a month in Lebanon: 70000 labourers that bare burdens▪ 80000 quarrymen that hewed in the mountaines: and of officers and ouerseers of the worke, no lesse then 3300 men. The description of this stately fabricke you may read in the first of Kings Chap. the 6 and 7. It was destroyed by Nabuchadnezar, at the taking of Hierusalem, Ao. M. 3350. After the returne of the Iewes againe from the Babylonian captivity, it was rebuilt; but with such opposition of the Samaritans, that the workmen were faine to hold their swords in one hand & their tooles in the other, to repulse, if need were, the violence of the enimy. This Temple was not answerable to the state and magnificence of the former, so that the Prophet Haggai had good occasion to say vnto the people cap. 2. v. 3. Who is lest among you that saw this house in her first glory? Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it, as nothing? Moreouer in fiue things it was defectiue. For it wanted the potte of Manna which the Lord commanded Moses to lay vp before the testimony for a memorial, Exod. 6.32. 2ly The Rod of Aron, which only among all the Rods of the Princes of Israel, budded: and was by God commanded to be kept before the testimony, for a tokē against

Certainly it is worth the noting (I hope I shal not herein be accounted superstitious) to see how happy or vnfortunate one and the same day is in diverse causes.

To omit our Henry 7th, whose luckie day was Saturday; I will returne to this Temple, which on a Sabaoth day, or Saturday, was taken by Pompey, on the same by Herod, on the same by Titus. After this ouerthrow, the Temple lay vnbuilt and in rubbish▪ till the raigne of Iulian that politicke enimy of the Church; who to diminish the numbers of the Christians, by the increase of the Iewes, began againe to build this Temple. But no sooner were the foundations laid, but an earthquake cast them vp againe; & fire from heauen consumed the tooles of the workmen, with stones, timber, and the rest of the materialls. As for the Citty it

selfe, it was reedified by Aelius Adrianus, who named it Aelia, draue thence the Iewes, and gaue it vnto the Christians. This new Citty was not built in the place of the old, for within this is mount Oliuet also comprehended. It is now famous for the Temple of the S
                        •
                     pulchre built by Helena (whom most report to haue beene daughter to Coylus a Brittish King) mother to Constantine the great. Much adoe had the good Lady to finde the place where the Lords body had bin laid; for the Iewes & Heathens had raised great hillocks on the place; and built there a Temple to Venus. This Temple being plucked downe, and the earth digged away, shee found the three crosses whereon our blessed Sauiour, and the two theeues had suffere
                     •
                  . To knowe which of these was the right Crosse, they were all carried to a woman, who had long been visited with sicknesse, and now lay at the point of death. The Crosses of the two theeues did the weake woman no good; but as soone as they laid on her the Crosse on which the Lord died, she leaped vp and was restored to her former health. This Temple of the Sepulchre euen at the first building, was highly reuerenced and esteemed by the Christians of these parts, and euen vntill our daies is it much resorted to, both by Pilgrims from all parts of the Romish Church, who fondly and superstitiously hope to merit by their iourney: and also by diuerse Gentlemen of the reformed Churches, who trauell hitherward; partly for curiosity, partly for loue to the antiquity of the place; and partly because their generous spirits imitate the heauen and delight in motion. Whosoeuer is admitted to the sight of this Sepulcher, payeth nine Crownes to the Turkish Officers; so that this tribute only is worth to the grand Signeur 80000 Duckats yearely.
               All this while we haue made no mention of the Levites, for they indeed made no Tribe, but had assigned vnto them 48 Cities for their habitations, proportionably taken out of the 12 Tribes. So was it ordered by the Lord, partly that they being set apart to his seruice, might be in euery place ready to instruct the people; & partly to fulfill the prophecy which hee had spoken by Iacob, who told Leui at his death, that hee would divide him in Iacob, and scatter him in Israel. The like fortune hee prophecied

to Simeon, of whom we read in the 19 of Ioshua, v. 19, that he had no setled habitation; but was taken

               The Iews called also Hebrews from Heber, one of Abrahams progenitors; or Hebraei quasi Abrahaei: at their descent into Egypt were but 70 soules; being the issue of Iacob and his 12 sons; namely 1 Ruben, 2 Simeon, 3 Leui, 4 Iudah, 5 Zabulon, 6 Issachar, 7 Dan, 8 Gad, 9 Asher, 10 Naphali, 11 Ioseph, 12 Beniamin. The posterity of these Patriarchs continued in bondage 215 yeares, vntill the yeare of the world 2453: at which time the Lord, mooued with their oppressions by the Egyptians, with a strong hand deliuered them; & placed them in these parts inhabited by the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perezites, the Iebusites, &c. At their first comming hither, and long after, they were gouerned by Iudges; whom God ordained, & the people elected: of whose acts, as also of the Acts of the Kings, I hope I shal not need to make any mention; there being none who either doe not, or ought not to knowe them. I will only obserue Chronologically the times of their gouernment, & specifie such things as the sacred pen-men spared.

During the gouernments of these Captains since the Babylonian captiuity, the kingdome of the Iewes was plagued on both sides by the Kings of Egypt and Syria: who ransacked their Cities, slaughtered their people, made hauock of their goods, and compell'd them to eat forbidden flesh, and sacrifice to Idols. To reforme these enormities, Mattathias and his fiue sonnes resisted the impetuous fury of Antiochus Epiphanes, and his Syrians; ouer whom when they had victoriously triumphed, the Iewes chose Iudas, surnamed Macchabaus, one of the worlds nine Worthies, for their Captaine.

Alexander escaping out of prison, troubled the quiet of his Country, till he was surprised by Gabinius, and slain by Seipio; after whose death Antigonus set free by Iulius Caesar, depriued Hircanus of his kingdome, and cut off his eares: revenge suddainly followed this villany; for he was slain by Marcus Antonius, and his kingdome giuen to a stranger.

                  4 Agrippa minor, before whom Paul pleaded, was the

last king of the Iewes; for in his time Ierusalem was ouerthrowne, and the kingdome made a Roman Prouince, Anno 73.
               
               When Salmanassar had subdued the 10 tribes, and carried them captiue, he planted a new set of inhabitants in this country; that so fruitfull & well situate a part of his Empire might yeeld its iust tribute; and not lye open to the fury of the next invader. But the Romans not hauing (it seemeth) so much policie or prouidence, as those whom they accounted barbarous; hauing laid the Country desolate, left it vnfurnished of new Colonies; whereby the Persians, next the Saracens, and after them the Turkes, entring the Roman Empire at this doore, haue successiuely driuen the Romans out of the whole house. Now that we may the better perceiue how the Romans had weakned, and almost vtterly rooted out the Iewish Nation: we will relate some of their particular massacres: which were not more cruelly inflicted on them by their enemies, then iustly deserued by themselues: they wishing (though, I suppose, not desiring) that the innocent bloud of our Sauiour should be on them and their children. First then the inhabitants of Caesarea slew of the Iewes in one day, about 20000: & such as fled were took and imprisoned by Florus the Lieutenant of Iudea. To reuenge this slaughter of the Iewes, set vpon the Syrians; in which skirmish 13000 of them were slain: The people of Alexandria put 50000 of them to the sword: they of Damascus 10000. Antonius a Roman Captain, slew in Ascalon 10000 of them; & Cestius an other Captain, 8040 persons. Now to come to the warres here managed by Vespasian: This Vespasian in the siege of Aphaca, slew & took prisoners 17130 persons; in Samaria 11600 persons; in Iosopata 42200 persons; in Ioppa so many killed and drowned themselues, that the Sea threw vp againe 4200 dead bodies, and the rest so totally perished, that there remained none to carry tydings vnto Hierusalem of the losse of the town. In the city of Tarichea were slain and made captiues 45000 persons, besides those which were giuen to the king Agrippa. In Gamala there perished 90000, and none left aliue but only two women. In Gascala 5000 men died by the

sword In the city of Gadara there were slain 32200, besides an infinite number of such as had drowned themselues. In Hierusalem it selfe there died 1100000 of them, partly by the sword, and partly by the famine, the worser enemy of the two; there were found 2000 in priuies and sinkes; and 97000 taken prisoners, insomuch that 30 Iewes were sold for a pennie. Now that Hierusalem was able to contain so huge a number of people is euident, in that when Cestius was Lieftenant of Iewry, the high Priest did at his request number the people which came thither to eat the Paschall Lambe, and found them to be two millions and 700000 liuing soules, all sound and purified. For to Leapers, or men hauing a flux of seed, or women in their monethly tearmes, or to strangers, it was not lawfull to eat it. And when Titus laid siege to the City, it was in the Feast of the Passeouer, when most of the people were there assembled, God (as it were) thus imprisoning them. All these massacres, besides diuers others which I haue omitted, and infinite numbers which were slain in the fields & villages, which drowned themselues, and which were priuatly made away, amounting in all to almost two millions of people, hapned in the compasse of foure yeares, beginning at the 12th of Nero, and ending at the second of Vespasian: Yet was not the whole Nation rooted out, till the yeare 136; for then this miserable people hauing stirred two notable rebellions; the one vnder Traian, and the last vnder Adrian the Emperours, were generally banished their natiue country, and neuer again permitted to inhabite it, otherwise the
                     •
                   as strangers. After this desolation, the Iewes were dispersed all ouer the World, & especially in Spaine, where Adrian commanded many of them to dwell: yet they found euery-where so little fauour, that hauing diuers times bin put to grieuous mulcts and ransomes, they are at last euen quite thrust out of Europe also. They were banished out of England by Edward the first, Anno 1290: Out of France by Philip the faire, 1307; Out of Spaine by Ferdinand the Catholique, 1492: Out of Portugall by Emanuell 1497: Out of Naples and Sicily by Charles the fift, 1539: yet are they found in great numbers in the Romish parts of Germany and Poland; in most Cities of Italy, especially

                  Rome, where there are no lesse then 15000 or 20000 of them, and also in the Popes Country of Avignion. The reason why they are permitted to liue thus vnder our holy fa

                     Sands rel.
                   is forsooth an expectation of their conversion: Which is a meere pretence, the reason indeed being the benefit hence arising to his Holines coffers. But the hopes of their conversion is small, and the meanes lesse. For besides the scandall, datum & acceptum, by the Papists fond worshipping of images so peremptorily contrary to the first table of the Law; they are not permitted to see any books of the Christian Religion, no not so much as the New Testament: and (which worketh most vpon men of their mettall) because at their conversion they must quit all their goods to the Church; as being ill gotten, and so by consequence the workes of the diuell, which in their baptisme they promise to renounce. They haue also a Synagogue at Amsterdam, and are pretty thick spred ouer the Dominions of the Turkes; who notwithstanding so hate them for crucifying of CHRIST, that they vse to say in detestation of a thing, I would I might dye a Iew: Neither will they permit a Iew to turn Turke vnlesse he be first baptized.
               What the revenues of this kingdome haue amounted to, since the diuision of it vnder Roboam, I know not. The Word of God specifieth the sum of them in the dayes of Solomon, 2 Chr. 9, 13: viz: 666 Talents of Gold (besides his Custome-house) which amounteth to two Millions & 997000 pounds a yeare, a huge summe for so small a kingdome.
               
                  Ierusalem was reedified by Aelius Adrianus, and giuen to the Christians; from whom it was taken by Cosroes & the Persians, Anno 615. from them it was forcibly wrested by Haumar and the Saracens, Anno 637. Next it fell into the power of Cutlu Moses and the Turkes, Anno 1009: vnder whose oppression when it had long groaned, Peter the Hermite stirred vp the Westerne Princes to relieue the distressed Christians; whose designes obtained their wished effect, vnder the banners of that victorious Prince Godfrey of Bullen, Anno 1099. This Godfrey for his merits, was to haue bin invested with the royall wreath of Maiesty; which he denyed, thinking it vnmeet to

weare a Crown of Gold, where his Sauiour had worne a crown of Thornes.

                  9 Guie of Lysingham, the last king of Ierusalem; during whose time Saladine the Sultan of Egypt won the kingdome, Ano 1187: which his successours defended against all invasions, till the yeare 1517, in which Selimus the first, Emperour of the Turkes, added the Holy land, together with Egypt, to his Empire. When Ierusalem was taken by the Christians, the German Emperours name was Fridericus; the Popes Vrbanus, the Hierosolymitan Patriarchs Heraclius, and so also were they called when the Christians again lost it. This is the conceit of Roger Houonden, in the life of Henry the second: but how it can agree with Chronology, I see not.
               
               After the taking of Hierusalem by Sultan Saladine, the Christians retired their forces into some of the other townes of the Holy land, which they made good against the Enemy; and defended them vnder the gouernment of these three kings following, viz:

                     10 Conrade M. of Montferrat.
                     
                     11 Henry E. of Champaigne.
                     
                     12 Iohn di Brenn; the last Christian king that euer had possessions in Syria, or Palestine. Yoland the daughter of this Iohn di Breenn, was wife to Fredericke King of Naples, who in her right entituled himself king of Hierusalem, and so now doe the Kings of Spaine; as heires vnto, and possessers of the kingdome of Naples. Concerning this title, it would not be amisse to insert this story. When the late warres were hot

betwen England and Spaine, there were Commissioners of both sides appointed to treat of peace. They met at a Town of the French kings, and first it was debated what tongue the negotiation should be handled in. A Spaniard thinking to giue the English Commissioners a shrewd gird, proposed the French tongue as most fit; it being a language which the Spaniards were well skilled in; and for these gentlemen of England, I suppose (said he) that they cannot be ignorant of the language of their fellow-subiects: Their Queene is Queene of France as well as England. Nay infaith my Masters, replyed Dr 
                        Dale, (the master of the requests:) the French tongue is too vulgar for a businesse of this secrecie and importance, especially in a French Town. We will rather treat in Hebrew, the language of Hierusalem, whereof your Master is king; and I suppose we are therein as well skilled as you in the French. And thus much for this title.

                  The Armes of the Christian kings in Ierusalem was Luna, a crosse crosset crossed, Sol, which was commonly called the crosse of Hierusalem.
               
               After the recouery of the Holy land from the Turke, these 3 orders of knighthood were instituted,
                     Grimston.
                   viz:

                     1 Of the Sepulcher, instituted by Queen Helena, the Mother of Constantine the Great. They were bound to defend the blessed Sepulcher, to warre against the Infidels, and to defend Pilgrims.
                     
                     2 Of St 
                        Iohn of Ierusalem begun by one Gerard, not long after Godfrey of Bullen, Ano 1124, and confirmed by Pope Gelasius the second. The roabe is a white Crosse of 8 points, their duty is to defend the Holy land, relieue Pilgrims, and succour Christian Princes against the Infidels, they were to be of noble extraction. They grew in time to be infinit rich, especially after the Templars were suppressed; most of whose possessions were transferred vnto this order:
                           Stow in the surv. of London.
                         insomuch that they had at one time in Christendome no fewer then 20000 Lordships; and in England the Prior of their order was accounted the prime Baron of the Realme. But now their intrado is not a little diminished by the with-drawing of the Kings of England, and other Protestant

Princes from the Church of Rome. We haue spoken of these Knights already, when we were in Malta: now I will only tell you, that their first Master was Foulke of Villaret; the last that had his residence in Hierusalem, Peter of Aste, in whose time they being expell'd Palestine, seised on Rhodes, are now seated in Malta, the present Master being Aloph of Vignacourt.
                     
                     3 Of the Templers, instituted by Hugh of Payennes, Ao 1113, & confirmed by Pope Eugenius. Their ensigne was red crosse, in token that they should shed their blood to defend CHRISTS Temple. They were buried crosse-legged, and wore on their backs the figure of the Crosse; for which they were by the common people called Crossebacke, or Crouch-back, and by corruption▪ Crook-backe. Edmund Earle of Lancaster, second son to our Henry the third, being of this order, was vulgarly called Edmund Crookebacke; which gaue Henry the 4th a foolish occasion to 
                           •
                        aigne, that this Edmund (from whom he was descended) was indeed the eldest son of King Henry: but for his crookednes and deformity, his yonger brother was preferred to the Crown before him. These Knights had in all Prouinces of Europe their subordinate gouernours, in which they did possesse no lesse then 16000 Lordships: the greatnes of which revenue was not the least cause of dissoluing the Order. For Philip the faire, King of France, had a plot to invest one of his sonnes with the title of King of Ierusalem, and did procure of the Pope the revenue of this Order: which he might the better doe, because Clement the 5th then Pope, for the loue he bare to France, had transferred his seat from Rome to Avignion. But heerein his hopes deceiued him; for this Order being dissolued, the lands thereto belonging were giuen to the Knights Hospitalers, or of S. Iohn. The crimes prooued against this Order was 1 their revolt from their professed obedience vnto the Patriarch of Hierusalem who w

                           •
                        ide; and thirdly their sinnes against nature. The house of our Law-students in London, called the Temple, was the chiefhouse of the Knights of this Order in England; & was by the Knights of S. Iohn, whose principall mansion was in Smithfield, sold vnto

the Students of the Lawes, for the yearely rent of 10l; about the middle of the reigne of Edward the third.
                  
               
               These three orders M. Selden (and deseruedly) putteth not in his Titles of Honour, in that they were prohibited to kisse a woman; honourarie knighthood, and the loue of Ladies, going together like vertue and reward.
               Thus much of Syria and Palestine.
               
            
            
               OF ARMENIA.

                  Euphrates and the Euxine sea; on the North, Tartary; on the South, Mesopotamia. But before we descend to the particulars of this Country, it is necessary we should take a survay of those mountaines, which lying East of Euphrates, part this Country from Anatolia.
                  
                     Knolles.
                   These mountaines are reputed to be those parts of the hills Taurus, and Anti-taurus; which are called Periadres, Scodrisci, and Amamus. The people here inhabiting, are more famous for nothing then their want of all things, stout, cruell, and warlike; maintaining themselues by hunting and stealing: as men liuing in so barren a soyle, that husbandry were vain and fruitlesse. They haue among them many beggerly villages, and few townes, the chiefe whereof is Maras, once the seat of their Kings; the people for the most part following the temperature of the Aire, and the fauourable aspect of the Sunne, in their remooues and dwellings. Their last king was Aladeules, whom the Turkish histories (who make frequent mention of him) call the mountaine king. He was a man who shrewdly molested Baiazet the second, in his conquest of Carmania; and Selmus the first in his warres against Persia; & hauing for many yeares molested, and impeached the victories of the one and the other; he was by Selimus taken & slain: & his kingdome being made a Turkish Prouince, these mountaines & their passages became subiect, and open to that Nation, Anno 1515.
               The Armenians are generally good Archers, merry, carelesse of honour, desiring ease, great bodied, comely, & willing to be soothed.

The women tall, but homely, kind to their children, poore and incontinent; accounting it a great credit to them, if they can please and become acceptable to such guests, as their husbands bring into the house: and most of the Virgins becomming mothers at ten yeares old; and bearing about in their armes, the witnesses of their abilities in that kind. Swearing is had in great respect with both, and such as cannot pick and steale, are deemed block-heads and sheep-biters.
               The whole Country is diuided into three Prouinces. 1 Colchis. 2. Georgia. 3 Turcomania.
               
               COLCHIS lyeth on the Euxine Sea, towards the North & East;
                     Brerewood.
                   the people hereof receiued the Christian Faith by Matthias; and now differ from other Christians their neighbours, in three circumstances only; viz: 1 in not baptising their children till the eighth yeare: 2ly in not entring into the Churches til the 60th yeare; but hearing diuine seruice, standing without the Temple: and 3ly in dedicating their youth to theft and rapine; their old age to the difficult work of repentance; They are vnder the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople.
               
               In this Country raigned Aetas, from whom Iason stole the Golden Fleece, by the aid and sorceries of Medea. This Country is now called Mengrelia: the chief townes whereof are 1 Aluati, and 2 Fassum on the banks of Phasis, 3 Dioscurias, where there were 300 seuerall languages spoken, because of the abundance of Marchants of all kingdomes: so that the Romans kept here continually 30 Interpreters, to mediat between the people and the Gouernour.
               2 GEORGIA hath not its name from S. George, whom here they greatly reuerence; but from the Georgi, who long before that time inhabited the adjacent Countries. It is bounded on the East with Media, on the West with Colchis; on the North with Albania, or Swiria; and on the South with the greater Armenia, or Turcomania: so that it lyeth just between the Euxine & the Caspian seas. The people are good souldiers, and receiued the Gospell in the time of Constantine the Great, on an occasion related by Socrates Scholasticus, indeed very miraculous, and (I doubt) vnworthy credit, and therefore I omit it. At this day

they consent in most doctrinall points with the Grecians, only they acknowledge not the Patriarch of Constantinople, but haue a Patriarch of their own, who is for the most part resident in his house on Mount Sinay in Palestine, and hath vnder his iurisdiction 18 Bishops.
               This Prouince was formerly called Iberia; the chiefe townes being 1 Lori, 2 Bascapan, 3 Testis, exceeding strongly fortified by the Turkes, to defend their new conquests from the Persians; and 4 Tomanis. Out of this Region, the Egyptian Sultans vsed to chuse their Souldiers or Mamaluskes, who at last grew so powerfull, that they assumed to themselues the kingdome of Egypt; which they long time valorously defended.
               TVRCOMANIA is seated in the midst between Colchis & Iberia. The chiefe Townes are Albanopolis, where S. Bartholomew was buried. 2 Van, which both by its naturall seat, and artificiall fortresses, is a strong bulwark against the Persian invasions. 3 Arminig the Metropolis of the Country at this time. 4 Trigranocerta, built by Tigranes, one of the most mighty Kings that euer ruled in this Country, as hauing added Media, Syria, and Parthia, to his own Dominions. This Prince married the daughter of Mithridates K. of Pontus, & aided him against the Romans: but with what successe, we haue already told you in Syria. As for his new city Tigrano certa, it was by Lucullus the Roman Generall, besieged & taken; wherein besides other riches was found 3000 talents in ready mony. 5 Artaxata, once the chief city of Armenia, so called, either because it was seated on the riuer Araxis; or from Artaxes a progenitour of Tigranes, who was the Founder of it. It is now called Coy, and was in the middle age named Esechia. Famous it is for two notable bat

                   Anno 1514. A victory which he bought with the losse of 30000 of his best men, and such a terrour to the whole Army; that the Turkes to this day call it, the only day of doome. The fields adioyning to the towne

wherein this cruell battaile was fought, are called the Chaldean fields. 6 Sebastia, the residence of the Patriarch of the Armenians, who differ from their neighbour Christians, in receiuing infants to the Lords Table, immediatly after Baptisme: secondly, in abstaining from vnclean beasts: thirdly, in fasting on Christmasse day: and fourthly, in holding their children ouer the fire, as a necessary circumstance in Baptisme, because Iohn the Baptist told the people which followed him, that CHRIST should baptise them with the spirit, and with fire; in which place he meaneth not materiall fire, but the liuely purgation of the Holy Ghost, according to the nature of fire. The Church of this sect is gouerned by two Patriarchs, whereof the one hath vnder his iurisdiction this Turcomania, comprehending 150000 Families, besides very many Monasteries: and the other hath vnder him the two Prouinces of Armenia the lesser, and Cilicia, comprehending 20000 Families or thereabouts.
               This Country being formerly, and properly called Armenia the greater, to distinguish it from a lesser of the same name in Anatolia, is now vulgarly called Turcomania; which name it deriueth from the Turkes, who being a people of Scythia, & too populous to be sustained with sufficient food in so barren a Country; broke through the Caspian streight, and seated themselues here in the yeare 844. Here they liued an obscure life, neither knowne nor regarded, till such time as Mahomet a Saracenicall Sultan of Persia, hauing imbarqued himselfe in a needlesse warre against the Caliph of Babylon, (which warre he could neithet finish with sa
                     •
                  ety, nor remit without losse of reputation) hired those Turkes to strengthen his part against the Caliph, by whose multitude and valour, he got a noble victory of his enemy. Perceiuing now how necessary it was to hinder their returne homeward, he stoppeth all the passages towards Armenia, intending to vse the Turkes (as they doe now their Asaph) to blunt the sword of the enemy. This treacherous dealing of Mahomet, could not but stirre vp a fury in the inraged multitude; who presently arme themselues, and by the fortunate conduct of Tangrolipix, gaue the Persians such an ouerthrow; that they lost, and the Turkes wonne, he Persian kingdome,

Anno 1030.
               Thus was Tangrolipix inthronized in the Persian chaire of Estate, which he not long after left to his son Axan; against whom Cutlu Moyses stirr'd vp some vnnaturall commotions: which seeming preiudicial to their new seated Monarchy, were strangled in their cradle, and Cutlu Moyses was sent with an army, to conquer what he could from the Christian Emperours; the report of whose approach, made all Asia to tremble, and many of her Prouinces, to submit themselues to his vict

                  As Axan successor to Tangrolipix, furthered the conquest of Cutlu Moses against the Christians; so he imployed Melech and Ducat, two of his kinsmen, against the Saracens; from whom they quickly conquered Syria and the Holy land, not long after recouered by the Princes of the West; against whom the Sultans of Damascus opposed themselues diuers times to their detriment. It fortuned at last that Almericus King of Ierusalem, made warre with the Caliph of Egypt, who vnable to resist him, implored aid of Noradin King of Damascus. He sent vnto his succour, Sarracon a fortunate Captaine; who not only repell'd the force of the Christians, but subdued the kingdome to himselfe. His successor Saladine also recouered the Holy land: but after his death, Palestine was lost to the Tartars; and Egypt to the Mamaluckes, who not long after regained Ierusalem. And thus ended the Zelzuccian Tribe in all the Turkish Dominions.

To him succeeded his son Ottoman, Anno 1280, who to reuenge some iniuries done to his people by the improuident Christians, took from them the City Nice; and took vpon him the title of Sultan, after the death of Aladine, in the yeare 1300.

                  The Turkes are generally well complexioned, of good stature, proportionably compacted, no idle talkers, no doers of things superfluous, hot & venerious, seruile to their Emperour, and zealous in religion. They nourish no haire on their head, & therefore keep on of all sides, counting it an opprobrious thing to see any vncouer their head, and vse to say when they dislike any thing which they haue seene or heard.

In their familiar salutations they lay their hands on their bosomes, and a little decline their bodies: but when they accost a person of ranke, they bow almost to the ground, and kisse the hem of his garment. Walking vp & downe they neuer vse, and much wonder at the often walking of Christians. Biddulph relateth, that being at his ambulatory exercise with his companions; a Turke demanded them whether they were out of their way, or their witts? If your way (quoth the Turke) lay toward the vpper end of the Cloister, why come you downwards: if to the neather end, why goe you backe againe. Shooting is their chiefe recreation, which they also follow with much lazinesse, sitting on carpets in the shaddow, & sending some of their slaues for their arrowes. They preferre, as they passe the streets, the left hand before the right; as being thereby made master of his sword with whom they walke. As they shaue their heads, so they weare their beards long, a signe of freedome; but the

These women liue in great awe and respect of their husband, neuer sitting with him at the table, but waiting till he hath done, and then withdrawing into

some by-roome. If their husband haue bin abroad, at his comming in they all rise from the stooles whereon they sate, kisse his hand, make their obeisance, and stand as long as he is in presence. The children which they haue, they carry not in their armes as we doe, but astride on their shoulders. They liue immured from the sight of the world, and permit not any male children, no not their owne sonnes, to come amongst them after they are 12 yeares old. From their husbands they cannot be divorced but on speciall occasion: but their husbands may put away them, or giue them to their slaues, when, and as often as they list. Far better is it with the sisters, or the daughters of the Sultan, to whom, when her father or brother bestoweth her on any of the Bassa's, he giueth her a dagger, saying, I giue thee this man to be thy slaue and bedfellow, if he be not louing, obedient, and du

When they are married, their husbands come not to bed vnto them vntill they are sent for, and then also they creepe in at the beds feet. That euer any of these Ladies made vse of their dagger I could neuer read: only I finde that Lutzis Bassa the chiefe man in the whole Empire next the Sultan himselfe, & of him very much beloued, hauing giuen his wife which was sister to Solyman the magnificent, a box on the eare; was vpon complaint by her made, thrust from all his honours, banished into Macedon, and had doubtlesly beene slaine, if the Emperors loue, and his own merits had not pleaded for him. And this is all the prerogatiue of a Sultans daughter, her sonnes being accounted as meere and ordinary Turkes only, and neuer being preferred aboue the ranke of a common or inferiour Captaine.
                  The better sort of the Turkes vse the Sclauonian tongue, the vulgar speake the Turkish language; which being originally the Tartarian, borroweth from the Persian, their words of state; from the Arabicke, their words of religion; from the Grecians, their words and tearmes of warre; and from the Italians, their tearmes of nauigation.

                  His forces are either for the Sea or the Land. His Sea forces are great in regard of his spacious sea coasts; vast woods, and number of subiects: he neuer suffered aboue one defeat, & that at Lepanto; yet the next yeare he shewed his Nauy whole and entire. Gallies are his only vessells, which being vnable to cope with ships of any bignesse, were not only the occasion of that ouerthrowe; but also haue heartned the Florentine, only with 6 great ships of warre to swagger in the Seas; so that for more safety, the tribute of Egypt is of late sent to Constantinople by land. The Captaine Bassa, or Admirall notwithstanding with a Nauy of 60 sayle, maketh a progresse about the Seas and Sea-Townes, to annoy the enimy, suppresse Pyrats, collect the tributes, and to redresse the abuses committed in the maritine Town

                  Their land-forces are either horse or foot. They which serue on horseback, are the Spahi and Asapi: these latter seruing to weary the enimies, and dull their swords with their multitudes of whose bodies the Ianizaries vse to make mounts whereon to assault the walls of a besieged Towne; and are by them so cō
                     temned, that a Ianizarie once sold two of them for a sheepes-head. As for the Spahi, they till they are inrolled into pay, are of the same originall and education with the Ianizaries; & called by the same name Azamoglans. Their pay is 10 Aspers a day▪ The Turke is able, and doth maintaine 150000 Horse at little or no cost; which no other Prince can doe with 14 Millions

of Gold: for wheresoeuer any parcell of land is conquered, it is diuided into diuers parts, and committed to the manuring of diuers men whom they call Timariots. These are to pay vnto the Emperour certaine rents, & at their own charges to send to his wars so many horse, excellently appointed for the field: and which is the chiefe point of their seruice, to keepe the subiects in all parts of his Empire in awe; for being as they are dispersed in all quarters of his dominions, the people can no sooner stirre, but these will be assembled and be vpon them. These Timariots are in all accounted to amount to 719000 fighting men; whereof 257000 haue their abode in Europe; 462000 in Asia and Africa. Were it not for these Timariots, as the Turks saying is, no grasse would growe where the Grand Signeurs horse hath once set his hoofe: for if the care of manuring the ground were committed to the peasants, and not to militarie men; the greatest part of the groūd in this Empire would grow wast and desolate. These Timariots were instituted by Othoman the first Turkish King of this family; and a curse by him laid on them that should annihilate the institution. The name is deriued from the Turkish word Timar, signifying a stipend.
                  But the nerues and sinewes of this warlike body are the Ianizaries, who by originall being Christians, are chosen by the Turkish officers euery fiue yeares, out of his Europaean dominions: and so distributed abroad to learne the language, customes & religion of the Turks: afterward according to their strength, will, or disposition, placed in diuers chambers. They of the first Chamber, are preferred some to bee Chiausies, such as goe on Embassies, and execute iudgements: others to be Sansiaks, or Gouernours of Citties, some to bee Bassa's, or commanders of Horsemen, and others to be Beglerbigs (id

These, before they are inrolled in pay, are called Azamoglans, & behaue themselues with much submissenesse toward their Seniours and Governours: but when once they are honoured with the title of Ianizaries, they grow by degrees into an intollerable pride and haughtinesse, Till of late, they were not permitted to marry; neither now can any of their sonnes be accounted any other thē a naturall Turke (whom of all people they account the basest) the eldest only excepted; to whom this prerogatiue was granted by Amurath the 3d when he came to the Crowne. They are in number 40000, of which 16000 are alwaies resident in Constantinople. In this Citty they are diuersly imployed, being as Constables to see the peace kept; as Clarks of the market to see to the weights and measures; as Officers to arrest common offenders; as Warders to looke to the gates; to guard the houses of Embassadours; and to trauell with strangers for their more safety; in which charge they are very faithfull. Their pay is but fiue Aspers a day, and two gownes yearely; neither are their hopes great, the command of 10, 20, or 100 men being their greatest preferment: yet are they very obsequious to their captaine or Aga; who is in autority inferiour to the meanest Bassa, though in power perhaps aboue the chiefest. For the crafty Turkes ioyne not power and authority together and if they obserue the Ianizaries to loue and respect their Aga too much, they quickly depriue him of life and office. The founder of this order was Amurath the first, Ano. 1365; their greatest establisher Amurath the 2d; their name signifieth young Souldiers. Now concerning these Ianizaries, we will farther consider the sway they beare in designing the successour: 2ly their insolency toward their Emperours and his Officers. 3ly Their behauiour in the vacancy of the throne: and 4ly their punishments.
                  
                     1 Concerning the first, I neuer find any particular sway the Iauizaries carried in the designation of their Emperour, till the death of Mahomet the great; when the Bassa's hauing chosen Corcut the sonne of Baiazet, were ouerruled by the Aga and

his Ianizaries, who more inclined to Baiazet his father, and son to Mahomet. Though I am not ignorant, that when this Mahomet succeeded in the Throne; the ioyfull acclamations made by these Souldiers, were accounted the chiefest signe of his secure and perpetuated establishment. But the chiefe instance of their power herein, was the inthronizing of Selimus; who being but the 7th sonne to this Baiazet, was not only preferred by thē before his brethren in his fathers life time; but by their aids also he seuerally mastered them, and in the end poysoned his father. To omit other examples, euen the last yeare Anno 1622, they slew the young Emperour Osmen, drew the now Sultan out of prison, and established him in the royaltie.
                     2 As for the next, the first example in which I find them peccant toward their Prince, was at the beginning of the raigne of the aboue mentioned Baiazet; when hearing of the intended death of Achmetes Bassa whom they loued, they brake open the Court gates, and told the Emperour, they would teach him like a drunkard, a beast, and a rascall as he was; to vse his great place and calling with more sobriety and discretion. Not long after conceauing farther displeasure against the said Baiazet, they shook their weapons against him, and refused to take him in the midst among them; and were not, without great and vile submission on his part, appeased. Against Selimus the first they also mutined, when being resolued to winter in Armenia, for the better pursuit of his victories toward the Persian; he was by them forced to returne home vnto Constantinople. Against Solyman they mutined so violently, that they compelled him to displace Rustan his chiefe Bassa and fauorite. Against Amurath the 3d, for placing ouer them a new Aga, they so strongly opposed themselues; that first they set fire on Constantinople, and burnt therein, besides shops and warehouses, 25 great Innes, 7 Temples, & 15000 houses: and in the end constrained him to giue them money; and to yeeld also into their hands two of his chiefe Counsellours, by them supposed to be their aduersaries; whom they drew about the streets. Finally (to omit the late tumult 1622 abouenamed) in the yeare 1600, they grew so disco
                           •
                        ented with Amurath the 3d, that they not only threatned to

destroy the principall officers of the Court, and the banishment of the Sultanesse his mother, but the deposing of himselfe also.
                     3 Now for the third. I finde it to haue beene the custome of these Ianizaries, betweene the death of an old Emperour, & the beginning of the new; to commit diuerse enormities: as the rifling of the houses of the Iewes, and Christians, among whom they dwelt; the murdering of the Bassa's, and principall men about the Court, whom they suspected not to haue fauoured them; and a number of the like outragious insolencies; for of these we finde frequent mention: as after the death of Amurath the 2d, and Mahomet the great, this last time the Marchants of Constantinople being naturall Turkes, scaped not their rauenous hands, neither could Mahomet Bassa avoid the fury of their swords. This spoile they tooke for so certaine a due, that if they were disappointed of it, they would presently raise commotions both in Court, Field, and Citty; vnlesse some present satisfaction were made them. To this end Achmat distributed among them 2 Millions & a halfe of Duckats: Selimus the first two Millions; others made an increase of their daily pay. But Selimus the 2d distributing among them 100000 Sultanies only, was by them prohibited to enter into his Seraglio, till he had inlarged his bounty; and the great Bassa's were wrapped about the pate with their Calliuers, for perswading them to quietnes. Now to preuent the dangerous and factious liberty, which in the vacancy of the Empire was vsually committed; the death of the old Emperour was with all secrecy concealed, till the arrivall of the new. To omit others, I will instance in the deaths of Mahomet the first, and Solyman only. This Solyman died at the siege of Sigeth in Hungary, which was so cunningly concealed by Mahomet Bassa the space of 20 daies: that before the Ianizaries knewe of it, his sonne Selimus had possessed himselfe of Constantinople, & came also to their army then in retreit homeward. For this Mahomet priuatly strangled the Physitians and Apothecaries which knewe of his death; commanded the Souldiers to goe on in their siege; and diuerse times shewed them their Emperour sitting in his horse-litter, as (being troubled with the Gout) he vsed to doe; and when the Citty was taken,

marched homeward with his dead body sitting still in the same manner. So after the death of Mahomet, the Bassa's of the court called their Diuanos as formerly they vsed; gaue order for the leuying of an Army, as if some war were intended: & the Kings Phisitians went vp and downe with their potions, as if they had him still in cure. But the Pensioners and Ianizaries misdoubting the matter, with all eagernesse desired to see him: which when the Bassa's durst not deny, they appointed the next day for their visitation. The next day the dead body was apparelled in royall large roabs, placed in a chaire at the end of a long Gallery, & a little boy cunningly placed behind him, to mooue the Kings hand to his head, as if he should stroke his beard, as his manner was: which signes of life and strength, the Souldiers seeing, held themselues contented, and so was his death concealed the space of 41 daies.
                     4 As for the last. These insolent & vnsufferable pranks committed so commonly by these masterfull slaues, so exceedingly stomached Baiazet the 2d, that he secretly purposed with himselfe, for curing so dangerous a disease, to vse, a desperate remedy: which was to kill and destroy suddenly all the Ianizaries. It is like that this Baiazet being a Scholler, had read how Constantine the great had ca
                           ••
                        ed the Praetorian Souldiers, & destroie their Campe, as men that were the causes of all the stirs in his Empire, and whose pride was come to an intollerable heighth: and hauing the same cause to destroy his Ianizaries, hoped to produce on them the same effect. But they hauing notice of the plot, for the time continued so vnited and linked together, that he durst not then attempt it; and they afterward siding with his some Se
                              •
                           imus, cast him out of his throne into his graue. Since which time the Emperors neuer durst punish them openly, but when any of them proueth delinquent, hee is sent priuily in the night to Pera; where by the way he is drowned, and a peece of Ordinance shot off, to signifie the performing of the Sultans command.
                  
                  Now for the Emperours themselues, we will consider them in matters of pleasure; in matters of ceremony; and in matters of state: these last being considerable in their three main points,

which are the murdering of their bretheren; the remoouing of their sonnes; their reuenue: and therein a touch of their gouernment. To these we will adde what apparent symptomes may be obserued to prognosticate the standing, decreasing, or increasing of this puissant Monarchy.
                  1 For the first, he hath not so few as 500 (sometimes 1000) choice Virgins, kept in a Seraglio by themselues; all slaues, born of Christian parents, and indeed the rarest beauties of his Empire. When he is disposed to take his pleasure with any of them they are all ranked in a long Gallery, and she is by the Aga of the women prepared for his bed, to whom hee giueth his handkercher. She that beareth him the first sonne is honoured with the title of Sultanesse (Queene mother we may call her) neither can he make any of them free, vnlesse he marry them. When the Sultan dieth, all his women are carried into another Seraglio, where they are strictly looked to, and liberally prouided for, & not seldome times are bestowed by the succeeding Sultan on his great Bassa's, and such as hee chiefly fauoureth, which is a principall honour. They are attended on by women onely, and Eunuches, these being not gelded only, but depriued of all their genitalls, and supplying the vses of nature with a siluer quill; which inhumane custome was brought in among them by Selimus the second, because he had seene a gelding couer a mare.
                  2 Their ceremonies are either performed by them, which is for the most part the building of a Mosche only to help to the saluation of their soules: or towards them by others, which are most apparant in the entertainment of Embassadours. For whē such come to his presence, they are led betweene two of his Courtiers, & comming before the throne on both sides whereof the Bassa's sit with admirable silence, resembling rather statua's then men; they bow themselues to the ground with all humility, laying their hands on their breasts, but neuer vncouering their heads, which (as wee before noted) is an vndecency. When they are to depart they goe all backwards, it being accounted very irreuerent to turne their backe parts towards a Prince so glorious. The reason why they are thus brought in betweene two, is said to be for their great honour; but is indeed

a feare they haue, lest the grand Signeur vnder the pretence of a salutation, or the deliuery of an embassie, should be stabbed. This warines they haue vsed euer since Miles Cobelits a Seruian; who scrambling from among the slaine at the battle of Cassoua, and being admitted to the speech of Amura
                           •
                        h the first, the author of that ouerthrowe; stabbed him into the belly with his dagger.
                  3 Amongst all the iarres and discontents that be, none haue beene with more vnkindnesse begun, or more eagernesse prosecuted, then those of brothers; not only in priuate families, but in the stemmes of Princes: the multitude of pretendants, being the originall of most ciuill warres. To preuent these publike emotions, the Emperours of Habassia vse to immure vp all their younger children in the hill Amara; the Persians to put out the eyes of their yonger brothers; and the Turkes to murther them: strange and horrid courses; whereby to auoid the feare of a warre in the state, they stirre vp a warre in their owne bowels. The first that among the Turkes began this barbarous cruelty, was Baiazet the first, on his brother Iacup: whom immediatly after his fathers death, he strangled with a bow-string: this being the ordinary instrument of their fratricide, because thereby none of the blood-royall of Ottoman is spilt. After him Mahomet the great caused his young brother then at nurse, to die the death, and was not without much adoe, perswaded from being the executioner himselfe. Amurath the 3d caused his fiue brethren to be at once strangled before his face; and Mahomet his sonne, no fewer then 19 in one day. By this course they imagine their owne estate to be infinitly secured, as knowing that Mustapha a younger sonne, stirred a rebellion against Amurath, aud Zemes against Baiazet, both the second of those names: that Solyman, Musa, and Isa, seuerally afflicted Mahomet; and Corcut, Selimus; the first of these names also. But yet they wil not knowe, that nothing sooner putteth their younger brothers into these acts of hostility, then an ineuitable certainty of a violent and vnnaturall death: whereas were they but secure of life, and a liberall and Princely maintenance, it is more then probable, they would rest content, as in other kingdomes the yonger

Princes doe. And notwithstanding this barbarous pollicy, they are not quite free from feare; as knowing that counterfeits haue heretofore much disturbed the qui

Mary. To preuent walking spirits, Mahomet the third, laid out the dead bodies of his father and 19 bretheren, as a common spectacle for all that passed by, or would come to behold them. The present Grand Signeur Mustapha, miraculously scaped the bowestring twice; first when his brother Achmat, & secondly when Osmen his young cosen were made Sultans; and is the first that in this Empire did euer succeed in the collaterall line.
                  4 The remouing of the young Princes is done for three reasons: 1 to weane them from the pleasures of the Court; 2l
                     
                        •

                        •
                     e them to hardnesse: and 3ly, and principally, to auoid the danger of a competitour, whereof old Princes are especially iealous. The common places destinat to this princely exile, are Amasia in Cappadocia, Magnesia in Caria, and such l
                        •
                     ke townes of Natolia. Neither doe the old Sultans by such a great distance think themselues secure altogether: but carry a vigilant eye ouer their sonnes actions, & haue intelligence of almost euery particular thought; the least suspition being cause sufficient to destroy them. So we finde Mustapha sonne to Solyman, the hopefullest branch that euer sprang from the Ottoman tree, to haue beene shamefully strangled by the command of his father; vpon a rumour only of a marriage,

which hee was said to haue negotiated with the Persian Kings daughter. When these Princes are once setled in their gouernments, it is a crime meriting no lesse punishment then death, to depart thence and come vnto Constantinople, before their fathers death, or vnlesse they are by their fathers sent for. Of this we haue a tragicall example of Mahomet, a Prince of great hope sonne to Baiazet the 2d: who desiring to see the fashion of his fathers Court, left Magnesia where hee was by his father confined; and attended by two or three Gentlemen came in the habit of a sea-faring man to Constantinople; and hauing obtained his desire, he returned to his charge. This strange action being quickly divulged abroad, and by diuerse variously interpreted, stirred such iealousies in the suspitious head of his old father; that he tooke order not long after to haue him secretly poysoned.
                  5 As for the ordinary reuenue, it consisteth either in mony receaued, or in mony saued. The mony saued is first by the Tartars, of whom he can continually command 60000 to attend him in his warres without any pay, but the spoile of the enimy. And 2ly by the Timariots, who nourish and bring into the field more horses then any Prince in Christendome can keepe (as we haue already said) for 14 millions of gold. The mony receaued is (according to Boterus) only 15 millions of Sultanies, which is nothing in respect of so great an Empire: the chiefe reasō where of is the tyrannicall gouernment of the Turke, which dehorteth men from tillage, marchandize, & other improuements of their estates; as knowing all their gettings to lye in the Grand Signeurs mercy. His extraordinary reuenew is vncredible: for besides that no Embassadour commeth before him empty handed; no man is master of his owne wealth farther then stands with the Emperours liking. So that his great Bassa's are but as spunges, to suck vp riches till their coffers swell, and then to be squeezed into his treasurie. These men as he aduances without enuy, so can he destroy without danger; no man here hoping for partakers if he should resist, as not being ignorant that one mans fortune is built on the defined ouerthrow of another. Such riches as they gaine, if they hap to die naturally, returne to the

Emperours coffers; who giueth only what he pleaseth to the children of the deceased. These Bassa's haue in their particular Prouinces, their Divanos, or Law courts, where iustice hath formerly beene administred with great integrity, but now not a little corrupted: yet the comfort is, that such as miscarry in their right, shall without delaies knowe what to trust to; & the Bassa's vpon complaint to the Emperour, are sure to die for it. Ouer these Bassa's (the chiefe of whom is the Vic

                  6 Concerning the present state of the Empire, many iudge it to be rather in the wane, then the increase; which iudgement they ground vpon good reasons; whereof these are the chiefe. First that the body is growne too monstrous for the head, the Sultans neuer since the death of Solyman accompanying their armies in person; but rioting and wasting their bodies and treasures at home: that the Ianizaries who haue beene accounted the principall strength of this Empire, are growne more factious in the Court, then valiant in the camp; corrupted with ease & liberty, drowned in prohibited wines, enseebled with the cō
                     tinuall converse with women, and fallen from their former ancestry of discipline: that of late they haue giuen no increase to their dominions: and as in the paths of vertue, non progred

                        est regredi, so in Empires by violence gotten, when they cease to be augmented, they beginne to be diminished: that rebellions haue in these latter times beene in this Empire strangely raised, and mightily supported; which commotions the former Sultans were neuer acquainted with: that the greatnesse of the Empire is such, that it laboureth with nothing more then the waightinesse of it selfe; so that it must in a manner needs decline pondere pressa suo, ouerburdened by its own mightinesse: that as in a naturall body surfet killeth more then a fasting; so in the body politike, too much extent sooner ruineth then too little or a mediocrity: that the sonnes of the Grand Signeur, whose brauenes of minde is by their father euer suspected; are (contrary sometimes to their owne nature and will) nursed vp in all effeminacy which once rooted in their youth, doth alwaies after assubiect

                     te him, the Florentine with 6 Ships only aweth him; and the Emir of Sidon ceaseth not daily to affront him: that by the auarice and corruption in the Court now raigning, all peace and warre, all counsells and informations, all wrongs and fauours are made saleable: that is more then apparant that their Empire is at the height, Et quod naturaliter procedere non potest (saith Velleius) recedit; Empires when they can ascend no higher, must by the ordinary course of nature haue a fall. All these are indeed more then probable prognostications of a dying Monarchy: but yet there is one greater, which is the present face of the state. The late Emperour Mustapha is yet childlesse, and as report giueth vs vtterly disabled for generation. The young brother of Osmen, is but a weake staffe for so huge an Empire to leane on, considering not only the infinite sicknesses
                        •
                     , and casualties of childhood; but also the danger he may iustly expect from Mustapha his vnkle. For likely it is that he hauing at the death of Achmat, receaued the gouernment, and after by the faction of Osmen being deposed, restored and displaced againe, & his life continually indangered: will secure himselfe from the like afterclapps, which may happen vnto him, when this young boy shall be a little older; by the taking of him away, if it bee (as no question but it is) possible. And so wee haue the end of the Ottoman race. Supposing then the O

                        toman line to faile (as in all likelyhood it may) what then becommeth of this vast Empire? Three there are which will bid faire for it, viz: the Crim Tartar, the Bassa's, the Ianizaries. The Crim Tartar may plead a composition, which is, that he supplying the Turkes Armies with 60000 men without pay; is for these succours to succeed in this Empire, whensoeuer the heires male doe sayle: & besides this, he may hope for no small succours from his confederate, &

allye the great Cham, to recouer his pretended right; & adde to the present glory of the Tartars, the renowne of getting so glorious a booty. The Bassa's may conceaue no small hope of dividing the whole Monarchie among themselues; partly by the example of Alexand
                           •
                        rs Captains, who after their masters death there being yet some of the blood royall remaining, parted among themselues his dominions: partly by an example in their owne state, when after the death of Aladine 2d; Caraman, Sarachan, Aidin, Carasus, and the rest of the more powerfull captaines, divided among them, the Turkish kingdome in lesser Asia,: and partly because being seated in most of the Prouinces as gouernours, and hauing diuerse bands of Souldiers at command; they may easily make that their owne, in which they are so fairely estated already: for so we finde the Sultans, or prouinciall gouernours of the Caliphs, to haue vsurped those Countries as proprietaries, to which they came but as substitutes. The Ianizaries may also build their hopes on very faire foundations, as being the sword and buckler of the Ottoman Empire: by their valour it being not only gotten, but preserued. We see the Praetorian Souldiers (or Ianizaries) of the Empire of Rome, which was a body farre more politique and better compacted then this, to haue created out of the Souldiers their Emperours; the Senate and Prouinces neuer daring not to confirme their election. But aboue all examples, that of the Mamaluckes of Aegypt is most pregnant, who were borne of Christian parents as these are; appointed for the guard of the Sultans, as these are; purposely hi

Add hereunto that they are already (in a maner) possessed of Constantinople, the head town, and heart of the Empire; and their hopes are not vaine. For my part, I hold thē to be the men most likely, vnlesse the Princes of Christendome, laying aside priuat malice, ioyne all in armes to strip this proud Peacock of her feathers: and (vpon so blessed an aduantage) to breake in peeces with a rod of iron, this insolent and burdensome

Monarchy. A thing rather to be desired thē expected. But this by way of supposition only, and as in a dreame. I awake.
                  And thus much I thought conuenient to insert in this place, concerning the originall, proceeding, & continuance; the naturall dispositions, pollicies, and forces of the Turkes.
                  
                  These three Prouinces of Armenia being iointly considered, haue suffered much viciscitude of Fortune. For after they had long breathed a free aire, they were all subdued, 1 to the Persian Monarchy by Darius. 2 To the Groeians by Alexander, after whose death the Country was gouerned by an interrupted succession of many tributary Kings.

               OF ARABIA.
               ARABIA is bounded on the East with the Persian Gulfe
                  ▪ on the West with the Red Sea; on the North with Mesopotamia, and Palestine; on the South with the Ocean.
               
               The people hereof are extreamely addicted to theft, which is the better part of their maintenance: they hate all sciences, as well Mechanicall as Ciuill, yet boast they much of their Nobility: they are of meane statures, feminine voices, swift of foot, raw-boned, and tawny. They differ not much from the old Arabians, who were a vagabond and theeuish nation. The most

ciuill of them were they of Arabia Faelix, who yet wanted not many barbarous customes; one whereof was the community of one wife only, amongst a whole stocke or kindred: & for her to accompany another man, was the death of them both. A king of this Country had 15 sonnes and but one daughter, who according to the custome was when she came to age, the cōmon wife of all her brothers. The young Lady wearied with such a continued excesse of dalliance, vsed this deuice to prohibit their too frequent accesse to her. It was the fashion that euery one which vsed to one woman, had staffes of a like making; and when any of them went in to their common wife, the setting of the staffe before her chamber dore, forbad entrance to the rest till it were remoued. This young Princesse secretly got a staffe like vnto these of her brothers, which when she was desirous of priuacy, she placed at her chamber dore, and so diuers times deceaued her brothers of their pleasures. It hapned that all the brothers being together, one of them departed towards his sisters lodging where finding a staffe before the dore, and knowing where he had left the rest of his brothers; he accused her of adultery; but the truth being knowne, the Lady was quitted, & her brothers visitations were afterwards limited.
               This Country is 4000 miles in compasse, and is vsually divided into Arabia Deserta, Petrosa, and Foelix. The people of al vse the Arabicke language, which not being confined within the narrow bounds of this one Prouince, extendeth it selfe through Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, Egypt, all Barbary, (excepting Morocco) and is the sacred language of the Mahometans.
               
               ARABIA DESERTA, is the place where the people of Israel wand
                     •
                  ed 40 yeares long, vnder the command of Moyses; being fed with Manna from heauen, & waters out of the dryest rocks. The soile is neither fit for herbage nor tillage, being couered ouer with a dry and thick sand. These sandy desarts are Seas of Arabia; their ships, the Camels; being beasts content with little sustenance, vsually carrying 600 waight, and sometimes a thousand. The inhabitants of this region are few, so are their Citties, the chiefe whereof is Bassora.
               
               ARABIA PETROSA is so called, either because it is so

rocky; or from Petra the chief Town, now called Rathalalah: the second town of note, is Aresh, or Arissa, consisting of a few houses, and a royall Castle, garrison'd with a hundred souldiers. 3 Ezion Geber on the coast of the Red sea, where Solomon's Navy kept station, before they put saile towards Ophir; and after they returned thence. The Country is barren and desolate, bearing neither grasse, nor trees; the palme only excepted; good store of dromedaries it hath, a beast of such swiftnes, that it will easily carry a man 100 miles a day. Here is also good store of Ostriches. But I returne to Petra, which I find to haue bin straightly besieged by Seuerus, and before him, by Traian but with like successe: The Romans in the skirmishes and assaults being alwayes put to the worst: nor did Traia

                     e escape so free, but he was compelled to cast away his Imperiall habite, and flye for his life; the next man vnto him being slain with a dart. Nay (if we may credit Dion, who is neuer sparing of the like prodigies) the Heauens fought against the Romans, with thunders, lightnings, whirlewinds, tempests; as often as they made any battery against the City. This Country containeth the regions Nabathaeae, and Agara, whereof the first is somtimes vsed for all Arabia, as in Ovid,

The other was possessed by the Saracens or Hagarens, descended of Abraham and Hagar. Here also dwelt the Emmins and Zanzummims cast out by the Amorites and the Moabites: here also dwelt the Midianites, to whom Moses fled & kept sheep: here also is Mount Horeb. This part of Arabia was first subdued and made a Prouince of the Empire by Palma, Lieftenant of Syria, vnder the aboue-mentioned Traiane.
               
               ARABIA FOELIX containeth the Peninsula, girt almost round with the Persian Gulfe, the Red sea, and the Ocean. In this Country is the Phoenix, which growing old, burneth it selfe, and from the ashes a new Phoenix is ingendred. This is the most fruitfull and pleasant Country in Asia, abounding with Gold and Pearles, with Balsamum, Myrrhe, and Frankincense,

especially about Saba the principall City, (whence that of the Poët, Thure Sabaeo:) the rest of note being 2 Medina, in or nigh vnto which, the Impostor Mahomet composed his Religion. This Town was the first that yeelded vnto Mahomet, after he began by force of Armes to establish his Religion, and begin his Empire. And questionlesse the taking hereof gaue great reputation to his enterprise; for Medina being taken, what City durst make resistance? 3 Zarvall the residence of the Caliphs, till the building of Bagdet by Bugiafer. 4 Mecha, wherein Christians are not permitted to enter, lest (I suppose) they should see the absurdities of the Mahumetans adoration of their great Prophets Sepulchre: whose body inclosed in an iron Coffer, was by an Adamant drawne vp to the roofe of the Temple, where it still hangeth. 5 Oran, the key of the South Ocean. 6 Danchali. 7 Elter, the only Town in Arabia, where the Christians are of the greater number. The first Roman that euer made expedition into this Country, was Largus, President of Aegypt vnder Augustus; one Samos being then King hereof. The Romans at first entrance, found no resistance; but when by the extraordinary heat of the aire, and drinking salt water, sicknes began to grow hot among them, the Arabians lustily falling vpon them, made them retire with more speed, & lesse honour, then they came thither. This Arabia is by Curtius called, Odorum fertilitate nobilis regio, for the Frankincense, wherwith (as we now said) it aboundeth: & is indeed so delicious a coū
                  try, that Danaeus, in his Commentary on Augustines Enchiridion ad Lawrentium, is perswaded, that it was the locall place of Paradise; Dicitur (saith he) terrestris Paradisi regio & pars quaedam esse Arabia, quae nunc appellatur Foelix.
               
               This Country followed the fortune of the foure great Monarchies, and was long subiect to the Greeke Emperours, euen vntill the raigne of Heraclius: who imploying certain Arabians in an expedition against Persia: not only denied them wages, but told them, that that was not to be giuen to dogs, which was prouided for the Roman Souldiers. Hereupon the Arabians revolt, and chuse Mahomet for their ring-leader.
               This Mahomet was borne in Itrarip, a Village of Arabia,
                  
Anno 572 his father was a Pagan, full of Idolatry; his mother a Iew blinded with superstition: from which worthy couple, could not but descend so godly an Imp as was Mahomet. At the Age of 16 yeares, he bound himself to a Marchant, whose affaires he managed with such care and discretion, that vpon the death of his Master, his Mistris took him for her husband; he being then aged 25 yeares. With her he liued till the 38th yeare of his age; but then God permitting, & the Diuell tempting him to it, he began to affect the name and estimation of a Prophet; and so cunningly he demeaned himself, that a sudden opinion of his sanctity was quickly divulged. After this he exhorted the Arabians, to renounce their alleagiance to the Greeke Emperours. Thus he being now made Captain of a rebellious multitude, inducted among them a new Religion, consisting partly of Iewish ceremonies, which he learned of one Abdalla; partly of Christian precepts, taught him by Sergius a Nestorian Monke; and partly of other phantasticall fopperies, which his own inventions suggested vnto him.
               The book of this Religion is called the Alcoran. It was composed by Osmen the 4th 
                  Caliph; who seeing the Saracens daily inclining to diuers Heresies, by reason of some false copies of Mahomets Lawes; and that the Empire by the same meanes was likely to fall into ciuill dissentions: By the help of his wife, who was Mahomets daughter, he got a sight of all Mahomets papers, which he reduced into 4 Volumes, & diuided into 206 Chapters: commanding expressely vpon paine of death, that that book, and that only, should be receiued as Canonicall, throughout his Dominions. The whole body of it is but an exposition and glosse of these 8 Commandements.
               First, euery one ought to beleeue that God is a great God, and only God, and Mahomet is his Prophet. They hold Abraham to be the friend of God, Moyses the messenger of God, & Christ the breath of God; whom they deny to be conceiued by the Holy Ghost
                  ▪ but that Mary grew with Child of him by smelling to a Rose, and was deliuered of him at her brests. They deny the mystery of the Trinitie, and punish such as speake 
                     •
                  gainst CHRIST, whose Religion was not (they say) taken away,

but mended by Mahomet. And he who in his Pilgrimage to Mecha, doth not comming or going, visit the Sepulchre of CHRIST; is reputed not to haue merited, or bettered himselfe any thing by his iourney.
               2 Euery man must marry to increase the Sectaries of Mahomet. Foure wiues he alloweth to euery man, and as many concubines as he will, between whom he setteth no difference either in affection, or in apparell, but that his wiues only can inioy his Sabbaoths benevolence. The women are not admitted to their Churches, nor after death to Paradise: and whereas in most or all other countries, fathers giue some portion with their daughters, the Saracens giue money for their wiues: which being once payed, the contract is registred in the Cadies booke, and this is all their formality of marriage. More of this theame we haue spoken in Turcomania.
               
               3 Euery one must giue of his wealth to the poore. Hence you shall haue some buy slaues, & then manu-mit them: buy birds, and then let them flie. They vse commonly to free prisoners, release bond-slaues, build Can
                     •
                  s for the reliefe of Passengers, repaire bridges, and mend high wayes. But their most ordinary almes consist in Sacrifices of Sheep or Oxen, which when the solemnity is performed, they distribute among the poore: insomuch that you shall hardly find any beggers among them.
               4 Euery one must make his prayers fiue times in a day. When they pray▪ they turne their bodies towards Mecha, but their faces sometimes one way, sometimes another way, beleeuing that he shall come behind them, being at their devotions. The first time is an houre before Sun-rising; the second at noone day; the third at three of the clock afternoone, the fourth at Sun-setting; the fift and last before they goe to sleep. At all these times the Cryers keep a bawling in the steeples (for the Turkes and Saracens haue no bels) for the people to come to Church. And such as cannot come, must when they heare the voyce of the Cryers, fall down in the place where they are, doe their deuotions, and kisse the ground thrice.
               5 Euery one must keepe a Lent one moneth in the yeare. This Lent is called Ramazan, in which they suppose the Alcoran
                  
was giuen vnto Mahomet, by an Angell. This fast is only intended in the dayes, the Law giuing leaue to frolick it in the nights, as they best please.
               6 Be obedient to thy parents; which Law is the most neglected of any, neuer any Children being so vnnaturall as the Turkish.
               
               7 Thou shalt not kill: which they keep vnviolated amongst themselues: but the poore Christians are sure to feele the smart of their fury. And as if by this Law the actual shedding of blood only were prohibited, they haue invented punishments for their offenders, worse then death it selfe; as 1 the strappado, which is hanging of them by the Armes drawne backward: when they are so bound, they are drawne vp on high, and let downe again with a violent swing, which vnioynteth all their back & armes. Secondly, they vse to hoyse vp their heeles, and with a great cudgell to giue them 3 or 400 blowes on the soles of their feet. Thirdly, it is ordinary to draw them naked vp to the top of a gibbet, or towre, full of hookes; and cutting the rope, to let them fall down again. But by the way they are caught by some of the hookes, where they commonly hang till they die for hunger.
               8 Doe vnto others as thou wouldst be done vnto thy selfe. To those that keep these Lawes, he promiseth Paradise, spred here and there with silk carpets, adorned with flowry fields, watred with Crystalline riuers, beautified with trees of Gold, vnder whose coole shade they shall spend their times with amorous Virgins, whose mansion shall not be farre distant. The men shall neuer exceed the age of 30, nor the women of fifteen; and both shall haue their virginities renewed as fast as lost.
               Friday he ordained to be the Sabbaoth day, partly to distinguish his followers from the Iewes, and Christians, who solemnize the dayes ensuing; but principally because he was on that day proclaimed Caliph, & solemnly so created. Wine, & swinesslesh are the principall things forbidden by the Alcoran, the last whereof they abstemiously refrain from; but on the first they are so sotted▪ that when they come at it, they seldome goe home again vnled; insomuch, that all the Wines in Constantinople haue bin thrown about the streets, and death made the penalty

for any that will presume to bring any more into the City.
               
                  Mahomet taught them that euery one should be saued by his own Religion, him only excepted that revolteth from the Alcoran, vnto another Law; and that at the end of the World▪ all men that professed any Religion, should goe into Paradise; the Iewes vnder the banner of Moses, the Christians vnder the banner of CHRIST, and the Sarracens vnder the banner of Mahomet. They compell no man therefore to abiure the faith in which he was borne, but commend & approue secretly such as they find zealous and constant in their own Religion: yet holding it an especiall honour to haue dayly new Proselites, they incite them by hope of freedome and preferment, which with many are motiues too much preuailing. Hence I haue heard many say, that it is better for a man that would inioy liberty of conscience, to liue in the Countries professing Mahumetanisme, then Papistry: for in the one he shall neuer be free from the bloody Inquisition; in the other he is neuer molested if he meddle not with their Law, their Women, or their slaues.
               The opinions which they hold concerning the end of the World, are very ridiculous; as that at the winding of a horne, not all flesh only, but the Angels themselues shall die; that the Earth with an Earth-quake shall be kneaded together like a lump of dough; that a second blast of the same horne shall after 40 daies restore all again; that Cain shall be the Captaine or ring-leader of the damned, who shall haue the countenances of dogs and Swine; that they shall passe ouer the bridge of iust

                  Mahomet was of low stature, schald-headed, euill proportioned, and as euill conditioned; being naturally addicted to all villanies, infinitly theeuish, and insatiably leacherous. He was troubled almost continually with the Falling-sicknes; to mask which infirmity, as repugnant to his pretended omnipotency; he said it was only a diuine rapture, wherein he conversed with the Angel Gabriel. He was well seen in Magick, by whose aid and help of the Di

From this returne of his, after his flight from Mecha, the Sarracens began their computation of yeares (as we from CHRISTS Natiuity) which they call the Hegira; which beginneth about the yeare of our redemption 617: concerning which time, I cannot but obserue, that Mahomet compiled his diuelish doctrine, beginning his Empire; and Boniface the third his Antichristian title, beginning his Empire, nigh about the same yeare.

The office of the Caliphs is now executed in the Turkes Dominion by the Musti, or chief Priest of the Sarracens.
               
               As Mars shewed himselfe a coadiutor to these Moores in their stupendious triumphs, so also did Phoebus powre down no lesse celestiall influence, on such as addicted themselues to schollership. Bagdet in Chaldea, Cairoan, Fess, Morocco in Barbary, & Corduba in Spaine, were their Vniuersities: out of which came the Philosophers, Avicen, and Averroes: the Physicians Rhasis, and Mesue: The Geographers Leo and Abilfada; & almost all the Textuaries and found Writers, as Hali, Algazel, Albumazar, &c. in Astrology; from whom the greatest part of our Astronomicall and Astrologicall termes are borrowed.
               There is now no Kingdome, Iland, or Prouince, which acknowledgeth the Empire of the Saracens, but the Kingdome of Fesse, and Morocco in Barbary. And now it is time to returne again to Arabia, which followed (as we told you) the fortune of the foure great monarchies. In the conquest of it by the first three, there occurreth nothing of any note; in the last, this is most remarkable. When Alexander was in his adolescencie or boyage, he on a time sacrificing to the gods, cast into the fire with both his hands, abundance of myrrhe and frankincense; which Leonidas one of the Nobility marking, aduised him to be more sparing of that precicus and deare commodity; til he was master of the Country where it grew. This admonition Alexander
                  
(when he had conquered Arabia) remembring, sent a ship laden with frankincense to Leonidas, bidding him hereafter serue the Gods more liberally, It was subdued vnto the Turks by Selimus the first, immediatly after his conquest of Egypt: yet are the people rather tributaries vnto, then prouincialls of the Turkish Empire. Two kings they haue of their own, whereof the one continually resideth in some good town of Arabia: the other haunteth about Syria, and the Holy land; liuing in tents, & being followed by the wild and theeuish Arabs.

               It is a custome, which hath from all antiquity bin vsed in this Country, that the maides which are marriageable, are yearely brought forth in publick, and set to sale to such as would marry them: and the mony which was giuen for the fairest, was by the Arithmeticall proportion of Iustice, giuen to the more deformed for their portions, to make them goe off the better and quicker. And hence perhaps the Fathers of our times vse to giue least mony with such of their daughters, whose beauty is a sufficient dowry: but to grease the fat sowes, with the addition of some hundreds of pounds; which made the merry fellow say, that the mony was a good match, if the wench were absent.

               Through this City ranne the faire and famous riuer Euphrates; of which there was an old prophesie, that the town should neuer be forced, till the riuer prooued its enemy. This made Sardanapalus make it the seat of warre against Belochus and Arbaces; who hauing for three whole yeares besieged it, the riuer ouer-flowed its bankes, and ouer-threw twenty furlong of the walls: Which accident compelled Sardanapalus to that desperat extremity, that he burned himself; and the enemy entred the Town. To this City Ionah was sent to preach, here being 1200000 persons that knew not the right hand from the left. 2 Arzeri, whence the whole Region is called Arzeri. 3 Aruela, nigh vnto which, Alexander fought his third and last battle against Darius, & his Persians; who being in number 800000, went home fewer by farre then they came thither.

               MESOPOTAMIA hath on the East Tigris, on the West Euphrates, on the North the hill Caucasus, on the South Chaldea. This Country in holy Scriptures is called Padan Aram; as also Mesopotamia, quasi 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , because it is invironed with the riuers Tigris and Euphrates, which ouerflow the Country, as Nilus doth Egypt, making it very fertile; and now it is called Dierbecke.
               
               The soyle is exceeding fertile, yeelding in most places 200, in some 300 increase. Here Abraham was borne: hither he sent his seruant to choose a wife for his son Isaack: hither Iacob fled from his brother Esau. And here Paradise is by men both skilled in Diuinity, and Geography, affirmed to haue stood. Yet

amongst all sorts of Writers we find different opinions. Some make Paradise to signifie a place of pleasure, and the foure Riuers to be the foure Cardinall Vertues: but these allegories on the Scriptures are not warrantable. Others place it in the aire, vnder the circle of the Moon; and tell vs that the 4 riuers in the Scriptures mentioned, fall down from thence, and runn
                     •
                  ng all vnder the Ocean, rise vp again in those places where they are now found: but this is so vain a foppery, that I will not honour it with a confutation. Such as make Paradise locall, are also diuided into 3 ranks, (for I omit the rest) whereof some place it vnder the Aequator; but this agreeth not with the bounds prescribed by the Holy Ghost. Some conceiue the 4 riuers to be Tigris, Euphrates, Nilus, and Ganges; and that Paradise was the whole World: but this cannot be, for then when Adam was driuen out of Paradise, it must also follow that he was driuen out of the World, which were absurd. Those of the soundest judgments place it here, in an Iland which is made by the Riuers Tigris and Euphrates, and some branches running from them: the vppermost of them they defend to be Pison (falsely rendred Ganges) which watereth the land of Havilah, now called Susiana; and the lowermost to be Gihon (improperly translated Nilu
                        •
                     
                  ) as running through Aethiopia Asiatica, which we shall further explain when we come into Africke. The reasons are, because Nilus and Ganges are too farre distant, and different in their course to spring from one fountaine, and that this Country is situate East of Arabia, where Moses was when he wrote Genesis.
               
               The chief Cities are Rechiais, formerly Edessa, whereof Agbarus was gouernour, who writ an Epistle to our Sauiour CHRIST,

                   and from him receiued an answer; the Copies wherof Eusebius setteth down in the end of his first book. Neare vnto this town Antoninus Caracalla, son to Septimius Severus, Emperour of Rome, was slain by the appointment of Macrinus, Captain of the Guard, herein disappointing Caracalla, who intended to haue made Macrinus shorter by the head. For Caracalla, conscious of his own vnworthines to rule the Empire, and fearing reuenge for the many murders he had in Rome committed;

sent to Maternianus his friend, desiring him to enquire of the Magicians, who should be his successour: He returned answer, that Macrinus was the man. The packet of Letters among which this was, was brought to Caracalla, as he was riding in his Chariot, who therfore deliuered them to Macrinus, whose office (besides the gouernment of the Praetorian gua
                     •
                  d) was to read and answer Letters of ordinary import. The Letter concerning himself comming to his hand, he seeing his imminent perill, resolued to strike the first blow; and to that end entrusted Martialis, one of his Centurions, who killed the vnfortunate Emperour, as he with-drew himself, levandae vesica gratia. It will not be any way amisse in this place to note; that all, or most of the Emperours before Constantine (who first receiued the faith) died vnnaturall deaths: but such as succeded him, went to their graues in peace, and full of yeares: from Iulius Caesar vnto Constantine, are numbred 40 Emperours, of which, Iulius was openly murdred in the Senate-house: Augustus death was hastned by his wife Livia; Tiberius by Macro, Caligula was slain by Cassius Chereas; Claudius poysoned by Agrippina: Nero and Otho laid violent hands on themselues. Galba and Vitellius were massacred by the Souldiers; Domitian by Stephanus; Commodus by Letus and Electus; Pertinax, and Iulianus by the tumultuous Guard; Caracalla by the command of Macrinus; Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander Severus, Maximinus, Maximus, and Balbienus, successiuely by the men of warre; Gordianus by Philip; Philip by the Souldiers; Hostilianus by Gallus & Aemilianus; they by the Souldiers; Valerianus died prisoner in Parthia; Florianus and Diocl
                        •
                     sian were the Authors of their own ends. Aurelianus was murdred by his houshold seruants. Gallienus, Quintilius, Tacitus & Probus by the fury of the military men. I haue out of this bedroll, purposely omitted such Emperours as were made by the Armies, without the approbation of the Senate; as also the Caesars, or designed successours of the Empire; most of whom got nothing by their designation or adoption, but ut citius intersicerentur. Some of these were cut off for their misdemeanours: some for seeking to reviue again the ancient Discipline: and some that others

might inioy their places. The chief cause of these continuall massacres, proceeded originally from the Senate and Emperours themselues. For when the Senatours had once permitted the Souldiers to elect Galba, and had confirmed that election, Evulgato (saith Tacitus) imperij arcano, principem alibi quam Romae fieri posse; more Emperors were made abroad in the field by the Legions, then at home by them. Secondly, from the Emperours, who by an vnseasonable loue to their guard souldiers, so strengthened them by priuiledges, and nusled them in their licentious courses; that on the smallest rebuke, they which were appointed for the safety of the Princes, prooued the Authors of their ruine; so truly was it said by Augustus in Dion: Metuendum est esse sine custode, sed multò magis à custode metuendum est. The last cause (be it causa per accidens, or per se) was the largesse which the new Emperours vsed to giue vnto the men of seruice. This custome was begun by Claudius Caesar, and continued by all his successours; insomuch that the Empire became saleable, and many times he which bade most, had it: As we see in Dion, when Sulpitianus offering twenty S

But it is now high time to goe on in my journey to Carra, obseruing only by the way, that when the valorous Christians had recouered this Country, and the Holy land; for the more facile administration of Iustice, they diuided the whole Conquest in 4 Tetrarchies; namely 1 Hierusalem, 2 Antioch, 3 Tripolis, 4 This Edessa; vnder euery one of which were many subordinate Lords, being all subiect to the Kings of Hierusalem. 2 Carra, called (Genesis 12.) by Moses, Haran; where Abraham dwelt, hauing left Vr. In this town the Moon was worshipped in both sexes: some honouring it as a female; then she was called Dea Luna; others as a male, and then Deus Lunus was his name: but with this fortune, both: Qui Lunam faemineo nomine putabat nuncupandam,

is mulieribus semper inserviat; at verò qui marem Deum esse crediderit, is uxori dominetur. I dare presume there were but few men of the former Religion: So vnwilling are they to be vnder the command of their wiues; neither will I herein blame them. Nigh vnto this town was Crassus the Romane Lieftenant, and one of the richest men that euer that Commonwealth knew▪ (for he was worth 7100 talents; the tenth being deduced, which he offered to Hercules, and three moneth corne giuen to the poore) vanquished by the Parthians, and their King Herodes.

               The chief Citties were Vr, now Horrea, whence Abraham▪
                   departed when he went to liue at Haran. 2 Erech. 3 Accad. 4 Carnell. and 5 Babel (Gen. 10.10.) This Babel (in the Hebrew it signifieth confusion) is famous for the confusion of languages, which here hapned: for immediatly after the Vniuersall deluge, Nimrod the son of Chus, the son of Cham, perswaded the people to secure themselues from the like after-claps, by building some stupendious Edifice, which might resist the sury of a second deluge. This counsell was generally embraced, Heber only and his Family, contradicting such an vnlawfull attempt. The maior part preuailing, the Towre began to reare a head of Maiesty, 5164 paces frō the ground: hauing its basis & circumference equall to the height. The passage to goe vp, went winding about the out-side, and was of an exceeding great bredth, there being not only roome for horses, carts, & the like meanes of carriage, to meet and turne; but lodgings also for

man and beast, and (as some report) grasse and corne-fields for their nourishment. But God beholding from high this fond attempt, sent amongst them (who before were one language) a confusion of 72 tongues: which hindred the proceeding of this building, one not being able to vnderstand what his fellow called for.

                     Bring me (quoth one) a trowell, quickly quicke;
                     One brings him vp a hammer: hew this bricke
                     (Another bids) and then they cleaue a tree:
                     Make fast this rope, and then they let it flee:
                     One calls for planks, another morter lackes:
                     They bring the first a stone; the last an axe.
                  
Thus being compell'd to desist from so vnluckie an enterprise, they greedily sought out such as they could vnderstand, with whom consorting themselues, they forget their former acquaintances, and now are diuided into 72 different nations: comprehending about 24000 men, besides women and children. Of these 72 nations, 27 of seuerall language, being the posterity of Sem, dispersed themselues about Asia: 30 others, of the loines of Cham, peopled Africk: and 15 more, being the issue of Iaphet, withdrew themselues towards Europe, and Asia the lesse. The sonnes of this Iaphet were first Gomer, from whom are descended the Germans and Gauls, called of of old Gomeri, and Cimbri. 2 Magog, father to the Magogins, or Scythians. 3 Madus, the author of the Madians, or Medes. 4 Tubal, the progenitour of the Spaniards. 5 Iavan, the parent of the Greeks and Ionians. 6 Meschus, the founder of the Mescates

                  Sem had fiue sonnes: from Elam descended the Elamites or Persians: from 2 Assur the Assyrians: from 3 Arphaxad the Arphaxadians, or Chaldes (his sonne Heber was father to the Hebrews

from 4 Aram the Aramites, or Syrians: and from Lud, the peoply of Lydia.

The sonnes of Ham were foure only: from Canaan descended the Cananites, being subdiuided into Hittites, Perezites, Amorites, Iebusites, &c. 2 from Cush, the father of the first Babylonian Monarch Nimrod, sprang the Cushians, or Aethiopians
                  ▪ from 3 Phut, the Phutians, Lybians, and Mauritanians, among whom there is a riuer of this name. from 4 Misraim the Aegyptians.

               These being thus dispersed, and afterward growing too populous for their first habitation; continually went out to seeke new dwelling places▪ So the Gauls filled Brittanie, the Brittaines Ireland; the Irish Scotland, and the Iles; so the Tyrian and Phoenicians planted their Colonies in diuers places, the Saca came into Saxonie, and the northerne regions continually vsed to send abroad the superfluity of their inhabitants. And thus much in this place concerning the confusion of tongues, & peopling of the world by diuers nations after the vniuersal deluge.
               
                  Babylon, howsoeuer the towre was hindred, went forward & was finished by Semiramis, whose wals were in circuit 60 miles 200 foot high, and 50 Cubits broad. As Semiramis once was platting her haire, newes was brought her of the revolt of this Towne; wherevpon leauing her head halfe vndrest, she went & besieged it; neuer ordering the rest of her haire till she had againe recouered it. How it fell into the hands of Cyrus, we learn out of Xenophons Cyri paideia which was in this manner. The riuer Euphrates ranne quite through the towne, round about whose banks the politike Prince cut many and deep channells: into which, when the Babylonians were securely merry at a generall feast, he suddainly drained and emptied the riuer, conueying

his whole forces into the Towne all along the dry & yeelding Channell, and in little time made himselfe master of it. From the Persians it revolted in the raigne of Darius Histaspis, and that sustenance might not be wanting to the men of warre they strangled the most part of the women; being in actions of this quality, not so much as necessary euills. When they had for twenty months so defended the Towne, that the Persians had lesse hope then euer of preuailing; Zopirus one of Darius Captaines, mangling his body and disfiguring his face by cutting oft his nose and eares; fled to the Babylonians, complaining of the tyranny of his King. They crediting his words, and knowing his prowesse, committed the charge of the whole army vnto him; as a man, to whom such barbarous vsage had made the King irreconcileable. But he taking his best opportunity, delivered both the Towne and Souldiers into the hands of his Soveraigne. Here died Alexander the Great, after whose death the Grecian Captaines regardfull rather of their owne ambitio

A wonderfull change of fortune: he who liuing thought the world too little for his valour, being dead found no place big enough for his body. Aristotle saith, that when Babylon was taken by the Greeke army, vnder the leading of this Macedonian Captaine; it was 3 daies, before one part tooke notice of the conquest. Nabuchadnezar mightily increased this Citty; which being almost ruined, was reedified by Bugiafar, Caliph of the Sarracens, at the expence of 18 millions of gold: and because of the many Gardens contained in it, hee caused it to bee called Bagadet or Bagdet, from Baga, in the Arabian tongue signifying a Garden. This is still a Towne of great traffiq

Between these two places they haue a custome of sending Post-pigeons, or sending by Pigeons letters of all occurences in hast; which is done in this manner. When the hen-doue sitteth and hath young, they take the Cock Pigeon, & put him into a cage; whom when he is by the Carauan carried a daies iourney off,

they set at liberty, & he straight flyeth home to his make. When by degrees they are perfectly taught, the Carriers & Marchants on any accident, fasten a letter about one of their necks; & they being freed, without any stay hast to the place from whence they were brought. And such as at home doe watch their returne, clime their hole, and taking a way the letter, are certified of the estate of the Carauan, or any other tidings whatsoeuer.
               The chiefe principall riuers of these Countries are 1 Euphrates beyond which the Romans could hardly extend their Empire: and 2 Tigris so named for its swiftnesse; the word in the Medians language signifying an Arrow: this riuer ariseth about Libanus, and disburdeneth himselfe into the Persian Sea.

               Of these 38 Kings we finde scarce any thing remaining but the names, which are in this order registred by Berosus, or rather by Annius a Monke of Viterbum in Tuscanie, who hath thrust vpon the world the fancies of his owne braine, vnder the name of that ancient historian. The chiefe Kings of note after Semiramis were,

                     1 Ninus, Amraphell or Zameis her son, who sudued the Arians, Bactrians, & Caspians; but was otherwise a man of effeminate and vnkingly carriage.
                     2 Belus extended the Assyrian Monarchy to Iudaea, subduing many nations: he was for his valour sirnamed by the after-writers Xerxes, i. e. the warriour, or the conquerour.
                     3 Mamitus reuiued againe the ancient discipline, corrupted by his predecessours; he awed Syria, and Aegypt.
                     
                     4 Ascatades perfected the conquest of Syria.
                     
                     5 Belochus Priscus was the author of diuination, by the flying of Birds called Auspicium. Of soothsaying there were in all 4 Kings; 1 this Auspicium, quasi auispicium, taken from the flight of Birds, either on the right or the left: and hence the proverb commeth ami sinistra, good lucke; because in giuing the right hand is opposite to the receauers left: or from the number of the Birds, whence Romulus was promised the Empire before his brother, because he had seene the double number: or lastly, from the nature of them, whence the same Romulus seeing the vultures was, saith Florus, spei plenus vrbem bellatricem fore, ita illi sanguini & praedae assuetae aves pollicebantur. 2ly 
                        Aruspicium ab aras inspiciendo, in which the Soothsayers obserued whether the beast to be sacrificed, came to the Altar willingly or not; whether the intrailes were of naturall colour, exulcerate, &c. or whether any part was wanting. All Histories and Poets afford variety of examples of this kinde; I need giue no particular instance. This diuination was first practised by the Hetrurians, who receaued their knowledge from one Tages, who arising to certaine plowmen out of a furrow, taught them this skil and then vanished. 3ly 
                        Tripudium quasi ter
                              •
                           ipudium, or terripanium, was a coniecturing of future successes, by the rebounding

of crummes cast into chickens. Wee haue an instance of this in the life of Tiberius Gracchus, who being busie about the Law Agraria; was forewarned by the keeper of his Chickens to desist, because when he had cast the crummmes to the coop, one only of the Chickens came out, and the same without eating returned in againe: which was a signe of ill lucke, as the greedy devouring of them had beene of good. But Tiberius not regarding the omen, was that day slaine. It is said to haue beene invented by the Lycians. 4ly 
                        Angurium ab auium garritu, was a pr
                           •
                        diction from the chirping or chattering of Birds; as also by the sounds and voices we heare we knowne not whence, from what cause. In this latter kinde, the death of Iulius Caesar was diuined, by the clattering of the armour in his house; & the poisoning of Germanicus by the sounding of a Trumpet of it's owne accord. In the former an Owle schreeching in the Senate house, was deemed ominous to Augustus: and a company of Crowes accompanying home Seianus, with great clamours and croakings; was deemed fatall to that great fauorite: and so it prooued.
                     6 Sardanapalus being wondrous effeminate, and vnworthy to gouerne so potent a nation; was deposed by Arbaces, Captaine of Media; and Belochus, Leistenant of Babylon; who compelled Sardanapalus to burne himselfe with all his riches for feare of more paine.
                  
               
               The treasure which Sardanapalus burnt with him, was 100 millions of talents in gold; and 1000 millions of talents in silver: which in our mony amounteth to 20 thousand and 500 millions of pounds. A masse of mony which surely had not seen the Sunne in many yeares, (I had almost said ages) & therefore growne rustie, desired a fire to purge it. This Sardanapalus afforded it; it may be to end his life with that, in which he placed his Summum bonum: It may be in spight vnto his enimies: and it is possible it might be in policy; that so great a treasure not fallen to the possession of his foes, might so much the more disable them from making resistance against, or detaining the Empire from his next successor. For it is of all things the most foolish both to loose our treasure, & with it to enrich our aduersaries.

On which consideration the Spaniards fired their Indian fleet at Gades, & the Genoais theirs at Tripolis; that their lading might not come into the possession of their enimies; the English and Mahumetans. After the death of this Sardanapalus, Arbaces tooke Media and Persia with the confining Prouinces: Belochus strengthned himselfe with Assyria, Chaldaea & the adiacent regions; his kingdome being called the new kingdome of Assyria.

                           ch, a Prince of dissolute and cruell nature, was assailed by Darius & Cyrus successours of Astiages, by whom his Empire was taken from him, and himselfe slaine 17. A.M. 3426.
                  
That this was the end of Balthassar, is the common opinion. But Ioseph Scaliger in his learned and industrious worke, de emendatione temporum, maketh him to bee slaine in a tumult by his owne people: who elected into the Empire a Noble man of the Medes, called in prophane stories, Nabonnedus; in diuine Darius Medus; who after a 17 yeares raigne, was slaine by Cyrus King of the Persians. By the leaue of so worthy a man, this cannot hold good. For the Lord by his Prophet Ieremie, had pronounced (Chap. 27.) That all nations should serue Nabucadnezzar, and his sonne, and his sonnes sonne: whereas Nabonnedus was a Prince of a strange bloud, and so the nation were not to serue him; and in Balthassar, the sonnes sonne of Nabuchadnezzar, was this oracle finished. But let vs examine his arguments; and withall the scoffes, which very prodigally he bestoweth on such as maintaine the contrary opinion. Natio Chronologorum, the whole rout of Chronologers: boni & diligentes viri, good simple meaning men: & addunt alia nihilo veriora, are his first complements. Vt igitur, quod chronologorum est, omnes resipiscant, &c. therefore that they may repent their euer being Chronologers, he bringeth in Berosus, cited by Iosephus, in his first booke against Appion. But Berosus there maketh Nabonnedus (to whom he saith the kingdome of Balthassar was by the people deliuered) to be a Babylonian; and not as Scaliger would haue him say, a noble man of the Medes: neither can the authority of Berosus, countervaile that of Daniel, who in his 6 Chapter telleth Balthassar, that his kingdome should be divided among the Medes and Persians. His 2d argument is drawne from the nature of the word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as it is in the same Chapter; and Darius the Mede tooke the Empire: by which word, tooke, is implied,

not a forcible inuasion, but a willing acceptance of the Empire offered. To this we answere, that Darius indeed tooke the Empire quietly and willingly▪ being offered vnto him by Cyrus, and his armie, consisting of Medes and

                     ersians: who according to the word of God, had taken it from Baltassar, Darius being then absent. Quid si probauero (saith he) eum cognominatum fuisse Medum? he hath yet one tricke more then all these: and Medus must not be the nationall name, but the surname of Darius; which he proueth out of a fragment of Megasthenes, cited by Eusebius, in his worke de praeparatione Euangelica, where he is called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. an argument of all others the most slight and triuiall. For beside

                   may there as well be the name of his nation, as his family; and besides that it thwarteth the places of Ieremie and Daniell already quoted: it is diametrally opposite to another place of the same Daniell, in his nineth Chapter, where he is called Darius of the seed of the Medes. Of this Darius more anon when we come into Media: As for Nabonnedus, questionlesse he was the same with Balthassar. For besides that Iosephus, and Berosus attribute to either of them the raigne of 17 yeares: the same Iosephus (who might best knowe the truth in this case) telleth vs, that Balthassar was by the Babylonians, called Naboandel; a name not so great a stranger to Nabonnedus, as Scaligers Darius, or Herodotus his Labinitus. But in this, wee must pardon Ioseph: scorne and contradiction was a part of his essence. For had he not beene in some things singular; in all, peremptory: he had neither beene a Scaliger, nor the sonne of Iulius.
               
               After the death of Balthassar, these Prouinces haue hitherto followed the fortune of the stronger potentate: as being subiect to 1 The Persians. 2 Graecians. 3 Romans. 4 Persians 5 Sarracens. 6 Persian Sophies; from whom during the Persians civill warres, Amurath the 3 Emperour of the Turkes subdued them.

This Sea is so call'd from the Caspij, a people of Scythia, whose Southerne coast bordreth on this Sea. 2ly The Hircanian Sea, of Hircania, a neighbour Province of Persia: and now 3ly

               This Country is generally barren, especially in the northern parts; so that they make their bread for the most part of dried Almonds, their drinke of the roots of certaine hearbs, and feed ordinarily on Venison. Yet is it not defectiue in pasture groūds, here being some grassie plaines of that bignesse, that 50000 horses may pasture on them. Here was that liquor called Oleum Med

               The chiefe Citties are Sultania, famous for the fairest Mosque of the East. 2 Symmachia, the strongest place of all Media, taken by the Turkes An. 1578; and made the seat of a Turkish Bashaw by Osman Beg, immediatly after the taking of Tauris 1585. 3 Nassivan called of old Nasuana. 4 Eres another strong peece. 5 Ardonille, the birth-place and seat of residence and dominion, to Bunie and Aider, the first authors of the Sophian sect and Empire in Persia: and the buriall place of Ismael the first Sophie or Emperour of Persia, of this line. 6 Tabris, or Tauris, in compasse 16 miles, containing in that space about 200000 inhabitants. The ayre hereof is very wholsome, but windie and cold; the cause why the Persian kings made it their place of residence in the summer; as they did Susis in the

winter. This Tauris is by some supposed to bee the same with Ecbatana, and hath beene thrice taken by the Turkes; namely, by Selimus the first; 2 by Solyman the magnificent; 3 by Osman, Generall to Amurath the 3d; who hath fortified it with a Castle. 7 Seruan, whence the whole Prouince is called Sh

The chiefe riuers of this Prouince are Arasse, and Ciro. The ancient Citties of this Country were Laodicea. 2 Apamia. 3 Rhaga, &c
               PERSIA is bounded on the East with the riuer Indus, on the West with the Persian Gulfe, on the North with the Caspian Sea, and the riuer Oxus; on the South with the maine Ocean. This Oxus is famous, first for being a bound fatall to monarchies, as we shall tell you when we come into Tartarie: and 2ly for the famous passage of Alexander ouer it. For hauing pursued Bessus, the murderer of Darius, vnto this riuer, & not knowing how to passe ouer it; there being neither ships on it, nor any timber nigh at hand to build them: hee caused a great many bagges and bladders to be stuffed with strawe; and so on them in six daies transported his whole armie. So that I may truely say with his owne historian, Vnum id consilium quod necessitas subiecerat, inijt, necessity is the best author of inuentions. The men are much addicted to hospitality, and poetrie; Lordly

in their complements, phantasticall in their apparell, magnificent in expences, louers of learning, maintainers of Nobility, & desirous of peace. The women are gorgeous in attire, delightsome in sequestration of pleasure, truly louing, neat & cleanly.
               Their religion is Mahumetanisme, in which they differ from the Turks about the successours of Mahomet (as shall be shewed anon) and some other circumstances; hence the Turks reputing them schismaticall, continually persecute them with the fire and the sword. Their language is as much vsed in the East, as the Latine in the West.
               The Christian religion was planted here, as also in Media, Hircania, Carmania, &c, by S. Thomas; and in other of the Provinces by S. Andrew.
               
               This Empire containeth these seuerall Prouinces.
               
                  1 PERSIS, now called Far, abounding in mettalls of Gold, Siluer, and pretious stones; euery where is moistned with ample lakes, and pleasant springs: a Country fertile in all things, except fruit, which they most want; as hauing no trees but Palme trees. The chiefe Citties are 1 Siras or Persepolis, built by Perses, sonne to Perseus sonne to Iupiter and Danae; who also chang'd the name of Elamites into that of Persians. For so we are informed by Isidor Persae (saith he) populi sunt à Perseo rego vocati, qui à Graecia Asiam transiens, ibi barbaras gentes graui diuturno

It is also called Hispaan, and is said to be a daies iourney about on horse backe. It is well walled, and fortefied with a strong fort; and beautified with two Seraglioes, the walls whereof are made of red marble, and paued with Mosaique worke. The chiefe street hereof is called the Atmaidan, being in figure fouresquare; euery side a quarter of a mile in length: round about which are scaffolds set, for the people to sit and behold the King and his Nobles, at their exercises of shooting, running, and the like:

                        m, the son of Noah; who first peopled here, and afterward withdrew himselfe more Southwestward, where the three Arabians now are, calling them the land of Chus: which are that land of Chus (our translatours read it the land of Aethiopia) which the riuer Gihon is said to encompasse, Gen, 2.13. this Gihon being indeed the more Westerly branch of the riuer Emphrates. Chus being thus departed this Country, left it to his son Hauilah; from whence it is in the Scriptures called the land of Hauilah where there is Gold, and which the riuer Pison is said to compasse Gen. 2.11. which Pison is the Southerne branch of the riuer Tigris or Hiddekel, called by Curtius, Pisotigris, and Pasitigris; Peruenit (saith he) rex ad fluvium, Pasitigrin incolae vocant, which he presently affirmeth to fall into the Persian Sea, as Tigris and Euphrates also doe. Now that there was another land of Hauilah, beside that in India, which we shall in due time mention; is euident out of the Scriptures: for whereas Saul smote the Amalechites from Sur to Hauilah, 1. Sam. 15.7. certainely it must be vnderstood of this Hauilah or Susiana, being the Easterne bound of that nation; and not of Hauilah in India; it being no where found that Saul was so great a traueller. The chief Citties hereof are 1 Susa, where the ancient Persian Princes vsed to keep Court in time of winter, as being more Southerly then Ecbatana, 2 Saum. 3 Casa.

                        Plutarch.
                      In this Country it was that Alexander being returned out of India, kept his Bacchanalia, in imitation of Bacchus, who had first conquer'd that nation, Night &

day he was continually feasting with his friends, on a scaffold drawne with 8 horses; his companions following in their chariots, some adorned with purple and silke, others with flowres & greene boughs, themselues wearing garlands on their heads, and carrying their carowsing cups in their hands. In this army there was neither helme, sword, arrow, or buckler seene

                      al their armour was cups, barrells, and flaggons; their skirmishing, eating, drinking, laughing, and singing. Attended they were by minstrells, playing on their Flutes, by women dancing, boyes shooting, all playing the drunken fooles most naturally. Thus marched they through the Country of Carmania, in as great dissolutenesse, as if Bacchus himselfe indeed had beene there, & lead the mummery; and for seauen whole daies this sottishnes continued. So that Curtius well obserueth: Si quid victis saltem aduersus comessantes animi fuisset, mille hercule viri, modo & sobrij, septem dierum crapula graues in suo triumpho capere potuerun
                           •

                      and extendeth to the riuer Indus. The chiefe Citty is Gedroson. In this Country it was that Alexander placed the monument of his Indian conquest. For intending to make his name immortall among that barbarous people, he made on the Westerne banke of Indus (which is in Gedrosia the forme of a campe; enlarged it with greater Cabbins then were sufficient for a man to lodge in; and builded in it higher mangers then horses could feed in. He caused also armours to be made of bigger proportion then his Souldiers bodies; & Bits for horses of extraordinary compasse and length; all which hee scattered about his Campe for the sauage people in time to come to wonder at. All that he did in this was, the occasioning of a suspition in many vnderstāding men, that his actions were lesse then it is thought; since hee laboured so earnestly to make them thought more then they were.

Some attribute this fiction of Paradice to Aladeules the mountaine-King of Anti Taurus, vanquished by Sel

                        m the first. The whole story is thus: Aladine inhabited a vallie in this Country,

                      the entrance into which he fortified with a strong Castle called Tigado. Hither hee brought all the lustie youths, and beautifull maidens of the adioyning Prouinces▪ The women were confined to their chambers, the men to prison; where hauing endured much sorrow, they were seuerally cast into dead sleepes, and conueyed to the women, where they were entertain'd with all the pleasures youth & lust could desire, or a sensuall minde affect. Hauing inioyed this happinesse a whole day, they were in a like sleepe convaied to their irons. Then would Aladine informe them how they had beene in Paradice, and that he could seat them there eternally, if they durst hazard their liues in his quarrells. This when they had sworne to doe, they were destinated to the massacre of such Princes, as were like to proue his bad neighbours; and they accordingly did execution. These men the Italians call Assassines (whence we vse the phrase to Assassinate) the name importing as much as theeues or cut-throats: such a one was he who murdered the Count to Tripolis in the warres for the holy land; and such a one was he who so desperately wounded our Edward the first, at the siege of Ptolemais or Acon.
                  
                  6 ARIA is situate North on Drangiana, it is now called Sargulzar, the chiefe Citty being called Aria. The people of this Country hauing rebelled against Alexander, were by him vanquished; and compelled to hide themselues in a Caue, situate on the top of an vnaccessible rocke; and with small strength easily defended. But to Alexander nothing was impossible, for he piling vp a great masse of timber euen with the caues mouth when the winde conueniently serued, set it on fire. By this device the Caue was filled so full of heat and smoake, that most

were stifled, some halfe burnt, and the rest contented to yeeld to the Victors mercy. In this Country also it was that Philotas his treason against Alexander was discouered, & himselfe accordingly rewarded. Finally, of this Country Satibarzanes was gouernour, who reuolting from Alexander, and ioyning battailes with him, boldly challenged any of Alexanders Captaines. This challenge was accepted by Eriguis, an aged, but spiritfull Souldier; who speaking alowd, quales milites Alexander habeat ostendam, gaue the onset, and at the second venew slew him. After whose death the Arians returned to their obedience.
                  7 ARACHOSIA is Eastward on Drangiana. Hereabouts the mountain Taurus is called Caucasus, on which vinctum Promethea fuisse antiquitas tradit, saith the Historian. Prometheus is indeed by the Poets sained to haue stolne fire from heauen, and to haue made a man of clay: for which presumptuous fact, Iupiter bound himon the hill Caucasus; where a vulture cōtinually fed on his Liuer. But according either to the truth of story, or their guesse at least, who make some story the ground of euery Fable; Prometheus being a very wise man, instructed the dead and clayie carcasses of others with wisdome: and that being very desirous to learne the nature of the starres, (which is the fire he stole from heauen) he made the highest part of Mount Caucasus his studie: where the inward care he had to accomplish his desire, might iustly haue bin compared to a vulture gnawing on his entrailes; and of this opinion is S. Augustine. The chiefe cities of this Countrie are 1 Sin, 2 Cabul, called anciently Alexandria, or (for distinctions sake) Alexandria Arachosiae. It was built by Alexander, at the foot of the hill Caucasus, and made a Macedonian Colonie; here being 7000 old Macedonian souldiers left by him to people and inhabite it. The whole Country is called now by the new name of the towne Cabul.
                  
                  8 PARAPOMISVS is North to Arachosia, it tooke its name from the mountaine Taurus, which extending it selfe through all Asia, is called according to the diuersity of places after diuers names; and in these parts. Parapomisus. A mountainous

and hillie Countrie it is, scarce knowne in the time of Alexander to its next borderers: at what time the people were so rude, that the barbarous Nations their neighbors held them not worthie their acquaintance. Agreste hominum genus, & inter Barbaros maximè inconditum, saith Curtius. The hills were high and barren, the valleyes indifferently fruitfull, but so shadowed with the mountaines, that their clearest day was but a twilight. Their buildings were base and low, their villages smal and beggerly: Their chiefe towne is now callrd Candatura, a well frequented market.
                  9 SACA lyeth yet more North on the borders of Scythia, the people hereof called the Sacae, were the progenitours of the Saxons; who leauing their country, seated themselues in the North part of Germanie: where they increased both in multitude & valour, growing a terror to their neighbours. The people of this Country liue yet in a barbarous fashion, hauing neither towne, nor house; but liuing in caues, and making theft their best calling.
                  10 HIRCANIA is situate somewhat Eastward from Sacae, and bordereth Northward on the Hircanian or Caspian Sea. The whole Prouince is nothing but a continued Forrest in a manner; and so Alexander when he conquered this Countrie found it. For the Hircanians so tied the boughs and spriggs of the trees together, that it was impossible for Alexander to come at them, till with incredible paines to his souldiers, he had caused the wood to be cut downe: at sight of which, the people whose hope was, that the Kings more earnest affaires would not licence him to stay so long about the enterprise; yeelded themselues. These Forrests giue lurking holes to infinit numbers of Tigers, celebrated in all Writers for their horrible fiercenesse; whence it grew to a common adage concerning cruell men, that they had sucked a Hircanian Tiger.

Particularly the riuer Zioberis in Hircania, is most famous; which rising out of the hils of that Country, and hauing runne a long continued course, hideth his waters vnder the earth for the space of 38 miles, and riseth againe into the riuer Rodagho, an other riuer of that Country also. It is said that Alexander made tryall of the truth hereof, by casting into the water two oxen, whom the streame at its owne rising cast vp againe.

He preserued the life of the yong infant, whose fortune at last lifted him vp to the Persian Monarchie; when abhorring his Grandfather for that intended cruelty, he both bereft him of his kingdome, and confined him to Hircania, when he had raigned 35 yeares, A.M. 3406.
                  3406
                  10 Cyaxares, sonne to Astiages, of the age of 52 yeares, succeeded his father. For Cyrus pretending no quarrell to his Vncle, who had neuer wronged him; left vnto him the Kingdome of Media, and tooke vnto himselfe the soueraigntie of Persia, which before was tributary to the Medes.
                  
               
               At this diuision of the Median Empire, as Torniellus in his Annals, (and that not improbably) is of opinion, it was also agreed on, that Cyrus should take the daughter and onely child of Cyaxares to wife; that they should both ioyne together in subduing of their neighbours; that whatsoeuer they wonne, should then belong to Cyaxares, (who was euen then an olde Prince) during his life; and that Cyrus should bee his heire. In the twentieth yeare of their seuerall raignes, they tooke Babylon, slew Baltazar, and destroyed the Empire of the Chaldeans. This action, the Scriptures attribute wholly to Cyaxares (who is by them called Darius Medus) whereof S. Hierome alleageth three reasons, 1o 
                  ordo aetatis, 2o 
                  regni, 3o 
                  propinquitatis: 1 Darius was older, 2ly the Empire of the Medes was more famous then that of the Persians; and 3ly the Vncle ought to bee preferred before the Nephew. We may adde to these three, the composition

aboue-mentioned, made betweene these Princes, at the beginning of their diuided reignes. The Greeke Writers attribute the victory onely to Cyrus, and that on three reasons also. 1 the Persians desirous to magnifie Cyrus their owne Country-man, gaue him all the glory of the action; and from the Persians the Greekes had it. Secondly, Cyrus only was imployed in the siege, (Darius then being absent) and by his valour and conduct, was the Empire of the Chaldaeans ruined: and thirdly Darius liued not fully two yeares after this great victorie, so that before remote Nations had taken notice of the conquest, Cyrus was in the Throne. Iosephus onely in the II Chapter of his 10 Booke, cutteth the thread euen betweene these two Princes, & telleth vs that Darius with his allie Cyrus, destroyed the estate of the Babylonians. That this Darius Medus of Daniel, is the Cyaxares of the Greekes, is more then manifest. For Iosephus in the place aboue-cited telleth vs,

But discords daylie arising, and the Macedonian puissance by these often broyles not smally broken; Arsaces one of the Parthian nobility, perswaded the barbarous people of the East, and among them the Persians, to cast off the Greeke yoke, and stand for their libertie: he himselfe taking vpon him the title of King, & investing himselfe with a Diademe, A.M. 3718.

This was a good beginning for the Persian Empire, the establishment followed not long after; Aurelianus the Emperour being vanquished and taken prisoner by Sapores the second King of this race; so that now the name of the Persian grew so terrible to the Romans, that Constantine the Great transplanted all the Colonies and Garrisons of the North-west parts of the Empire, into the East; to keepe the Persians from growing too farre vpon the Roman Prouinces: & remooued also the seate of the Empire nigher vnto them, from Rome to Constantinople. And thus hauing shewne you the beginning and establishment, the foundation and building of the new kingdome of the Persians; take along with you the Catalogue of their Kings, vntill they once more lost the soueraignty of their own Nation, and became slaues againe.

After their death, Hali hoped a more comfortable Sunne would shine vpon his sincere proceeding; but Mnavias a valiant man of warre obtained that dignity; and to hinder all future claimes, slew Hali with his sonne Ossan, and 11 of the sonnes of this Ossan, the twelfth escaping with life. From this twelfth sonne, by name Musa Ceresin, one Guine Sophie deriued his pedegree, Anno 1360; & considering that now there had no Caliph beene in long time, began to contriue the establishing of that honourable estate, in his owne family: but he leauing this life, left also the rude lump

of his begunne proiects, to be licked ouer with the industrie of his sonne Aider Sophie: He being a man of great sanctity and much power, as fortified with the surest bulwarke, viz: the constant affection of the people; was thought by Vssan Cussanes, a husband worthy of his daughter.

After this victory, he being crowned King or Sophie, or Shangh of Persia, altered the forme of Religion, making Hali and himselfe the true successours of Mahomet: but condemning Ab

Surius in his Commentaries, writing purposely the acts of this Ismael, saith; that the Iewes on some fond conceit, were strongly perswaded that he was their Messias: but it proued quite contrary, there neuer being man that more vexed and grieued them, then he.

Vnder the walls of this Town died Iulian the Apostata, a bitter enemie to the Faith of Christ. For though he was no open persecutor, yet he forbade the Christians the vse of prophane learning: thinking the prohition of that, to bee the principall meanes to weaken the Faith of Christ; the vse whereof our moderne Schismatickes thinke to bee the onely hinderance of the inlargement of the number of the faithfull. Not considering how that confutation is most powerfull, which is drawne from the doctrine and tenets of our aduersaries: nor calling to minde how S. Paul in his Epistles, citeth in the first of Titus, Epimenides; in the 17th of the Acts, Aratus; and in the first and 15th of the Corinths, the Poet Euripides.

Next the Parthians, I am perswaded that the English haue bin reputed the best bow-men; these hauing gotten as many noble victories ouer the French, as euer the other did ouer the Roman. At this time archery is euery-where neglected, the gunne silencing all former offensiue weapons, but how iustly I know not: it is a disputation aboue my moderating, Sir Iohn Smith, and Sir Roger Williams hauing defended their seuerall parts in it, and

many good iudgements siding with the one and the other. I come now to the Kings.

                  This subuersion of the Parthian state, as it was primarily wrought by the vnresistible power of Heauen; so may wee referre it, as to a second cause vnto the barbarous massacre of this people by Antoninus Caracalla, and a quarrell thence arising, Caracalla hauing negotiated a marriage with this Artabanus daughter, and going to solemnize the nuptials, was met by the old King; accompanied with the flower of his soldiers, people, and nobles, in their triumphall ornaments. No sooner was this honourable retinue come nigh his Armie, but the watch word giuen, the Roman soldiers (according to their Emperours directions) put them all to the sword; the King himselfe hardly escaping with life. Caracalla being dead, Macrinus his successor was assaulted by the reenforced Parthians, who after a three-dayes battaile, hearing how Caracalla had bin slaine by Macrinus, made peace with him, there hauing beene in these 3 dayes businesse, great losse on both sides: so that it was now no mastery for the Persians to surprise a kingdome thus weakned, and vnable to make resistance.
               
                  Parthia thus conquered, Anno 228, continued a member of the Persian Monarchie, till the ouer-throw of Ormusda the last of the second race: when this Country falling together with Persia into the hands of the Caliphs, had her proper Sultans. Ao 1350, Gempsas a Soldan of this Countrie, recouered the reputation of the Parthians, by subduing the Persians, as we haue told you: and together with Persia, it is now subiect to the Sophios.
               
               Thus much of Parthia.
               
            
            
               OF TARTARIA.
               
                  
                     Maginus.
                  TARTARIA is bounded on the East with the Easterne Ocean, on the West with Muscouie, and Moldauia; on

the North with the Scythicke, or frozen Ocean; & on the south with Mare Caspium, the hill Taurus, and the wall of China.
               
               This Country extendeth it selfe from East to West, 5400 miles; and from North to South, 3600 miles.
               This Country was of old knowne by the name of Scythia; whose inhabitants were the posterity of Magog, the son of Iaphet; called first Magogins afterward Scythes from Scythus their first King. The seuerall inhabitants were first Essedones, men who reioyced most at their parents deaths; of whose heads trimly wrought, and rounded with Gold, they vsed to make their carowsing cups. 2 Agathyrsi, who vsed to paint themselues; euery one the more noble he was, the more deformed & stained: for which cause, some haue conceited our Pictes, to haue drawne their originall from hence. 3 Nomades, who having no houses, vsed there to abide longest, where the fodder for their cattle was best; which being once consumed, they departed. 4 Axiacae, who were very valiant, but withall barbarous and inhumane; vsing in their warres to drinke the blood of him whom they first slewe, euen as it distilled out of his wounds. 5 Geloni, who vsed to apparell themselues with the skinnes of their enimies heads; and their horses with the skinne of their bodies. and 6 Neuri, of whom (beleeue it who list) it is reported, that they could turne themselues into Wolues, and anon againe resume their true being.
               The Country by reason of the many riuers running through and sometimes ouerflowing it; was very abundant in grasse: but in fuell so deficient, that their fires were made of bones, insteed of wood. This name of Scythia extending it selfe into Europe, euen vnto all regions lying North from Danubius, called also Sarmatia, and Scythia Europaea: and so populous hath it alwaies beene▪ that it is by diuerse authors stiled the mother of all inundations, vagina gentium, and officina genoris humani.
                  
                     From hence indeed Hunns, Herules, Franks, Bulgarians,
                     Circassians, Sueues, Burgundians, Turkes, Tartarians,
                     Dutch, Cimbers, Normans, Almaines, Ostrogothes,
                     Tigurins, Lombards, Vandals, Visigothes:
                     Haue swarmed like Locusts round about this ball,
                     And spoyl'd the fairest Prouinces of all.
                  
                  
As she was populous, so were the people also valourous. They thrice ouerranne all Asia, ouercame the Egyptians, Parthians, Medes,
                  
                     Heredotus
                   and Persians; these last by the hands of a woman, viz: Tomyris: who to reuenge the death of her son Spargapises slaine by Cyrus, encountred him in open field, cut of 200000 of his men, & chopping off his head threw it into a cauldron of bloud saying, Satia te sanguine quem sitisti. Darius the successour of Cambises, either to reuenge this ouerthrowe, or to get reputation, or to requite a former incursion of this people into Asia, in the time of Cyarxes which we before haue mentioned; entred with a huge armie: but with little honour and lesse safety, as we shall anon perceaue. These were the only armies that euer were brought into Scythia, no potentate after this daring to enter the Country in hostile manner.

                  17 Lanthinus, in whose time the Persian king Darius leading an Armie of 700000 men, was vanquished by the Amazons, Hircanians, and other nations of Scythia. The whole narration is thus. Darius on the causes lately mentioned, intended an expedition into Scythia: from which neither the example of Cyrus, nor any reason could disswade him. For his better iournying, he built a bridge ouer Thracius Bosphorus, and another ouer Ister; about that place where it parteth Bulgaria from Moldauia. To the keepers of this last bridge hee left a cord hauing in it sixtie knots; willing them every day to vntie one of them, and if he returned not till the knots were all vntied, he licenced them to depart. This done hee marcheth vp into the Country, the Scythians still flying before him, and leading him into the most desert and vnuitualed parts of the Countrey.

When they had him at this pinch, they sent to him an Embassadour with a bird, a mouse, a frogge, and a handfull of arrows, b
                        •
                     dding the Persians, if they could, to read them that riddle; and departed. Darius coniectured that the Scythians had submitted themselues, by deliuering into his hands their Earth, Ayre, Water, and Armes; hieroglyphically specified in their present. But Gobrias one of the seauen Princes gaue this interpretation. O yee Persians, vnlesse yee can like a Bird fly through the ayre, like a Frog swim through the water, or like a Mouse make your way vnder the earth; ye can by no meanes escape the Scythian Arrowes. Indeed this commentary agreed best with the text: for the Scythians following him, or rather driuing him before them, cut off many thousands of his Armie.
               
               There was a long controuersie betweene the Aegyptians & those people for antiquity; which was at last pronounced to belong to the Scythian
                  ▪ with this verdict, Scytharum gens semper antiquissima. Anacharsis the Philosopher was of this countrey.
               There were diuers other Kings of Scythia, whose names lye obscured for want of a Historiographer: And now the very name of Scythia is extinct.
               As for the Tartars, they are by some supposed to be the ofspring of the ten Tribes, whom Salmanassar led away captiue; and that especially for two reasons.
                     Breerwood
                   The first is, that the word Tatari (by which name they rather ought to be called, then by that of Tartari) signifieth in the Syriacke and Hebrew tongues, a remnant. To this we answere, that the name of this people is deriued from the riuer Tartar, as some; or from the region called Tartar, where they first dwelt, as most thinke: and againe that though the Hebrew word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   signifie a remnant, yet can it not be properly applyed to the Tartars, who so infinitely exceed the Iewes, that they cannot be thought to bee a remainder of them. 2ly They alleage for proofe, that this people vse circumcision, the character of the Iewish nation. To this wee reply that circumcision was common to many people besides the Iewes, as to the Aegyptians, Aethiopians, &c. and that rather as a nationall custome, then a religious ordinance: and againe that

the Tartars cannot be proued to haue receaued circumcision, before they receaued Mahumetanisme. 3ly There is brought to confirme this opinion, a place of Esdras, chap. 13. lib. 2. where it is said, that the ten Tribes (that they might the better keepe Gods statutes) passed ouer the riuer Euphrates, and after a iourny of a yeare and a halfe, came into a country called Arsareth. This we refell by shewing the impossibilities; for the Tartars (when their name was first known) were meere Idolaters, had no remembrance of the law, obserued not the Sabboth, nor any other points of the Iewish religion: and so the ten Tribes retired not hither to keepe Gods statutes. 2ly 
                  Euphrates lieth quite West from Assyria, & those places to which Salmanassar transplanted the Israelites; and so it could not bee passed ouer in a iourney toward the North. And 3ly it is very improbable that the ten Tribes should either bee so simple, as to leaue Assyria where they were peaceably setled; or so valiant, as to force a passage through those Countries of Scythia, which neither Persians, Greekes, or Romans were able to withstand. But of this people more anon.
               
                  Tartaria is now vsually diuided into these parts,

                  TARTARIA PRECOPENSIS containeth all Taurica Chersonesus, and the Asiatican banks of Tanais. The chiefe citties are 1 Precops, whence the whole nation is called Precopensis. 2 Crim, the ancient seat of the Tartarian rulers, whence named they were the Crim Tartars. 3 Oczackow, the residence of the present Princes. 4 Capha (anciently Theodosia) a towne of great trafficke, which Mahomet the Great took from the Genois. The Tartarians were first placed in this Country by Baido (or Roido) a braue Captaine, which subdued all Muscovia. Mahomet the great cōtracted with them a league; that the Tartar should aid the Turke on all occasions with 60000 men, and those to demand no pay: to requite which, the Tartar is to succeed in the Turkish Empire, if at any time the issue male should happen

to faile. After this couenant, the great Turke vsed (as still hee doth) to send the new elected Cham a banner, as a token of his approbation of their election.
               The men of this Country,
                     Boter.
                   as of the other 4 parts, are swarth, not so much by the heat of the sunne, as their own fluttishnesse; illfauored, thick-lipp'd, flat-nosed, broad-shouldered, swift of foot, laborious, and vigilant; barbarous euery where in behaviour, especially in Antiqua and Asiaticae. In religion they are some Pagans, some Mahumetans. The women are sutable to the men, wanting & scorning mony; adorning themselues with gew-gawes of copper, feathers, and latton.
               TARTARIA ASIATICA, called also Muscovitica, and Deserta (as anciently Sarmatia Asiatica;) is situate about the bankes of the riuer Volga. The people here for the most part, liue in Tents made of beasts skinnes, and account it a great misery to stay longer in a place, then the pastures afford meat for their Cattle. For this reason they sow no corne, making horseflesh their chief food, either warmed a little at their saddle bow or schorched with the sunne; and vse to drinke sowre Mares milke. They liue together in troopes, which they call Hordes, and in their iournies and remoues too and fro, they obserue the Pole-starre. Of these Herdes the more inclinable to ciuility are they of Astrachan and Casan; who liue in houses, sowe Corne, and build defencible Townes: which good orders haue beene but of late vsed, viz: since they were made subiect to the Muscouite, by the valour of Basilius and his sonne Iohn Basiliades. Before they were subdued by the Muscouite,

                   they were diuided states, and had two seuerall Kings or Rulers. Casaus last King by name Chelealcezks, submitted himselfe to the Emperour of Russia, and became his tributary: but againe reuolting, hee was vanquished in field, and his people eternally made subiect Ano 1553. The Horde of Astrachan is situate Southeast of Casan, downe toward the Caspian Sea, and was conquered by Basilius Anno 1494. Next to these, the principall hords are Zavoll, and Noyhan. Zavoll called the great Hords, or the Hord of the Zavolhenses, lieth betweene the riuer Volga, and Iaich: and is as it were the mother of the rest. It had particular kings till the

yeare 1506, when the Cham of the Precopenses subdued them: but they discontentedly bearing the yoke, gaue vnto Basilius a faire opportunity, to bring them vnder the empire of Muscouy: which accordingly hee did. Noyhan called the Horde of the Noyacenses, is the most Northerne Horde of all, and hath the most warlike people. They were first gouerned without any King after the manner of Venice: but at last the Country was diuided betweene three of the most potent among them. Now they are againe vnited vnder one Prince or Duke, who is tributary to the Muscouite.
               
               The chiefe Citties are 1 Casan. 2 Noyhan. 3 Scarayckzicke. 4 Astrachan, nigh vnto which Selimus the second, receaued a memorable ouerthrowe by Basiliades. Betweene this Country Precopense, and Muscouia, liue the Mordwits: a Tartarian people, which participate of all religions; being baptized like the Christians, circumcised as the Iewes, and Turkes, & worshipping Idols like Pagans.

The people are iust of the same life and conditions with them of Asiatica. This Country lieth farthest North, as extending beyond the Polare circle, and butting on the frozen Ocean; and though the vulgar lie either in skinne Tents, or vnder their Carts, yet haue they some

The people hereof account it a great honour, to haue their wiues & sisters, at the pleasure of such as they entertaine: and when vpon the command of Mango Chan, they had for three yeares abstained from this beastly practise; they obtained a restitution of it againe, vpon a protestatiō, that they could neuer thriue since they left it.
               Here is in this Country a beast of exquisite shape, about the bignesse of a Goat; which euery full Moone hath a swelling vnder the belly: which, the hunters (at that time chasing the said beast) hauing cut it off, and dried it against the Sunne; proueth

a most dainty pleasing perfume. In this Country is the Wildernesse or Desert called Lop: From whence came King Tabor, whom Charles the fift burned at Mantua 1540; for perswading the people to returne to Iudaisme: and in this Countrey groweth Rhubarbe, an herbe of that excellent nature, that the whole world is beholding to these Barbarians for it, as a soueraigne helpe for many diseases.
               ZAGATHAI, called of old Scythia intra montem Imaum, is situate about the Caspian Sea; extending to the borders of the Sophian Empire. It comprehendeth the Prouinces of Bactria, Sogdiana, Margiana, Turchestan, and Zagataia.
               
               
                  Margiana lieth South to Tartaria Antiqua, & East to Hircania: the chiefe Citties are 1 Indion, called once Alexandria Margianae; a Towne which Antiochus Soter king of Syria fortified with a strong wall. 2 Maran, nigh vnto which Ismael Sophie ouerthrew the Cham of Tartarie.
               
               
                  Sogdiana, lieth on the North of Bactria: The chiefe Citties are Oxiana, seated on the riuer Oxus. 2 Maruca. 3 Alexandria Sogdianae built by Alexander at his going toward India. Here also stood in the time of Alexander, the strong and famous City of Cyropolis, built by Cyrus, to fortifie his borders against the Scythians. It held out against that great Macedonian, a long time; and he himselfe comming nigher to the walls, then discretion would permit an ordinarily Generall; had such a blow on the necke with a stone, that he fel to the ground, his eyes swimming in his head, and his whole armie giuing him for slaine. But reuiuing, he tooke the towne by a mine, and leuel'd it with the ground.
               
                  Bactria lieth East to Margiana, and South to Sogdiana; this Country is now called Chorazzau, the two former Iess

Ouer these Bessus was Captaine, who so villanously betrayed Darius; and was by Spitamenes serued with the same sawce; who deliuered

In the time of the Assyrian Monarch Ninus, here raigned the first king Zoroastes, who is said by some, first to haue inuented Astronomy: which assertion I dare not affirme, considering that the fathers before the flood were well seene in this science. Perhaps the inuention hereof is attributed to the king, either for that he first committed that to writing, which was taught by tradition: or else compiled the confused writings of others, into one methodicall body. Against him Ninus made warre, but was forced to fly with the losse of 10000 Assyrians; and hauing againe repaired his armie, encountred Zoroastes, slew him, & vnited Bactria to his Monarchie. Afterward it was made subiect to the Persians, then to the Syrian successours of Alexander, til the yeare of the world, 3720: in which time Theodates, one who was but gouernour of 1000 Citties & Townes (by which we may guesse at the former populousnesse) assumed to himselfe the title of King: which honour continued in his family, til the yeare 3786; when Enchrendes the last king, was slain by the Bogdians, and Drangians. Then returned it to the Syrians; afterwards it was sub

                  ected to the Romans, vnder whom it receaued the Christian faith by the preaching of St 
                  Thomas, together with the other two Prouinces. The Persians, Sarracens, & now the Tartars haue beene successiuely their Lords.
               
                  Turchestan, is the Country where the Turkes first inhabited, before their irruption into Armenia. The chief Cities are Calba, and Ocerra. That this people tooke the name of Turkes, either from the Teucri, the Troians, or from Turca a towne of Persia, is friuolous to affirme; considering how long before the Turks had any commerce with the Persians, Pomponius Mela placeth the Turcae and Thyrsagetae together in this tract: and as for their descent from the Troians, I hold it so vaine, that it needeth no confutation. The first time that euer this people tooke on thē any military emploiment, was in the raigne of the Emperour Mauritius, about the yeare 600: when they were discomfited

by Chaganus, Captaine or Cham of the Avares, another Scythian nation, of whom wee haue before spoken in Hungarye. Their second expedition as it was more necessary, hunger enforcing them to it; so was it also more prosperous: stating them in a great part of the greater Armenia, Anno 1844; and what they haue since done, we haue there told you.
               
                  Zagataie, the name giuer at this day to all the Prouince; tooke its name from Sachetaie a Noble man of the Tartars: to whose care this part of their new Empire was committed. To him succeeded Ogg, who was the father of Tamerlane; who by marriage with the daughter and heire of Gino Chan, obtained the Tartarian Empire. Hee subdued the Aegyptians, Syrians, Persians, and Turkes; against whose vnfortunate King Baiazet the first, he conducted an Army of 700000 fighting men, and wonne a famous victory of his enimy: hee terrefied the Muscovites, and frighted the puissant King of China: and dying diuided his Empire amongst his sons; who lost it in as short space as their father had conquered it: nothing remaining not subdued, of which Tamerlane was not possessed, before his warre-like expeditions.
               The chiefe Citties are 1 Bochara, the seat of the Prouinciall Gouernour. 2 Sarmachand, which gaue both a Cradle and a Graue to mighty Tamerlane. This Citty hee enriched, with all the treasurie and spoiles of his manifold victories; and in one instance to speake the rest, he sent hither from Damascus only, 8000 Camels laden with spoiles, & choicest moueable goods. From this Tamerlane the great Moguls are descended. This Towne was originally called Matacanda, and was by Spitamenes (who hauing deliuered Bessus into the hands of Alexander, afterwards revolted from him) made good against the Macedonians: Menedemus with 3800 men besieging it. But Spitamenes preuailed, slew Menedemus, and 2300 of his Souldiers; & then fled to Bactria: where he was slaine by his wi
                     •
                  e, and his head presented to the Conquerour. At this Towne also was it that Alexander in a drunken fury, slew his friend Clytus; who at the battaile by the riuer Granvicus, had saued his life, by receauing a blowe directed at him.
               
                  CATHAIE is bounded on the East with the Orientall Ocean, on the West with the other Tartarian Prouinces, on the North with the Scythicke Sea, and on the South with China. This is thought to haue beene the ancient habitation of the Seres; who being excellent in the weauing of silkes, which they made of a fine wooll growing on the leaues of trees, occasioned all silkes to be called Serica. It is said of this people, that they had neither theefe, nor whore among them.
               The soyle aboundeth with variety of fruits; superfluously furnished with Rice, Graine, Wooll, Silke, Hemp, Rhewbarbe, Muske, and excellent fine Chamlets. So that it scorneth to giue precedency to any of the flourishing Prouinces in Europe.
               
               The people are very warlike, strong in matters of action, fearelesse of the greatest dangers, & patient of labour & want. They are of meane stature, little eyes, sharpe sight, and weare their beards thinne. They are of a very good wit, dresse them selues gorgeously, and fare on occasions sumptuously. Finally these and they of Zagataie are the most honourable people of the Tartars, indifferently ciuill, louers of arts both mechanicall and ciuill, and inhabiting diuerse faire Citties. The chiefe are 1 Caraian where the women vse to gild their teeth. 2 Tebeth, famous for her abundance in Corall. 3 Cambalu, seated on the riuer Polysanga, honoured with the great Chams residence, and enriched with a mighty confluence of Merchants of all sorts: besides other merchandises, there are euery yeare 1000 Carts loaded with silke, sent thither from China. This Citty is in compasse 28 miles besides the Suburbs; in which besides other inhabitants of all sorts, are 50000 Astrologers, or rather fortune tellers. 4 Xaindu, the Pallace of the Emperor, is of a fouresquare figure, euery side extending 8 miles in length: within this quadrate is another, whose sides are 6 miles long, & within that another of foure miles square, which is the Pallace it selfe. Betweene these seuerall walls, are Walkes, Gardens, Orchards, Fish-ponds, places for all manner of exercise, & Parkes, Forrests, Chases for all manner of game.
               
                  Cathaie was anciently called Scythia extra montem Imaum, and tooke, no doubt, this name from the Cathei, whom the textuarie

Geographer Strabo, placeth in this tract. The people hereof were conuerted by S. Andrew, & long continued Christians though infected with the opinions of Nestorius, whose sect at this day is spread all ouer the East. They differ from the Church of Rome and Greece, saying that in Christ were two persons, as well as two natures. 2, that the Virgin Mary ought not to be called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 2 Their Priests may marry when and as often as they will. The chiefe meanes by which this heresie is so propagated, was by the wickednesse of Cosrees, a king of Persia; who vpon a meere hatred to Heraclius the Greeke Emperour, inforced all the Christians inhabiting his dominions, to become Nestorians, or abandon their country. Their Patriarke hath his residence at Musal in Mesopotamia; which dignity is not electiue, but descendeth from the Father to the sonne. The solemnities of marriage because they are somewhat vsuall, I will now relate vnto you. Their wiues they see not till they are married, but hearing a good report of the young woman, sollicite her father for her. If he yeeld, then they meet at the Chancell of the Church, in which there is a partition: the man and his friends standing on the one side; the womar and her friends on the other. When they are met, the Cassise, or Churchman, biddeth the yong man put his hand through a hole in the partition, and take his wife by the hand; which he doth. Then commeth the mother of the young woman, & with a sharpe pointed instrument all to be pricketh the new married mans hand. If when he feeleth the smart, hee letteth his wiues hand goe; they take it for a signe that he will not loue her: but if he hold her fast, and wring her by the hand till she cry; then is he counted a louing man, and her friends are glad that they bestowed her on him. After the marriage consummate, if a male child be borne vnto them, the father looseth his owne name, & is called by that of his eldest sonne; and if the fathers name bee Moses, and the sonnes name Ioseph; the father is no more called Moses, but Aben Ioseph, that is the father of Ioseph: so highly doe they reuerence marriage, and the fruit thereof posterity.
               The people of this Country inioyed all the immunities of good subiects vnder the Nestorian kings of Tenduch; to whom

                  ightly belongeth, then to the Emperour of Habassia, or Aethiopia interior. The last of these Kings of Tenduch was Vn-cham, who vsing indirect dealings towards the Tartars, a base and obscure people; prouoked thē now ready to leaue his neighbourhood, and seeke new habitations, to turne their whole forces against him: whom they easily vanquished, & made Cingis their Captaine king of T

                     nduch.
               
               It is recorded that Cingis before he ioyned battaile with Vn-Cham, consulted with his diuiners and Astrologers of the successe. They taking a greenereed cleft it asunder, writ on the one the name of Cingis, and Vn-Cham on the other: and placed thē not farre asunder. Then fell they to reading their Charmes and coniurations, the two reeds fell a

                  ighting in the sight of the whole army, and Cingis Reed ouercame the other: whereby they foretold the ioyful newes of victory to the Tartars, which accordingly hapned. And this was the first step by which this base and beggerly nation beganne to mount vnto the chaire of Empire and Soueraignty: whereas before they liued like beasts hauing neither letters nor faith, nor dwelling, nor reputation, nor valour, nor indeed any thing fitting a man.

The great distance of Countries and difficulty of the iourney haue hindred further discoueries: For the great Cham, the Duke of Muscovie, & the king of China, will neither suffer any of their subiects to travel abroad; nor permit any forrainers to view their dominions, or enter into them, vnlesse either Embassadours or Marchants.
               
               This gouernment is tyrannicall; the great Cham is Lord of all; and in his tongue, besides which they haue almost no laws consisteth the power of life or death: he is called by the simple vulgar, the shaddow of spirits, and sonne of the immortall God. At the death of the Cham, the 7 chiefe Princes assemble to crowne his sonne; whom they place on a blacke course cloath, telling him if he raigne well, heauen shall be his reward: if ill, hee shall not haue so much as a corner of that black cloath to rest his body on: then they put the Crowne on his head, and kissing his feet, sweare vnto him fealty and homage. And at the funerall of these great Monarchs they vse to kill some of his guard souldiers, whereof hee hath 12000 in continuall pay: saying vnto them: Ite & domino nostro seruite in alia vita. Paulus Venetus reporteth, that at the obsequies of Mango Cham, no sewer then 10000 were slaine on this occasion.
               These Chams are for the most part seuere iusticers, & punish almost for euery small fault with sudden death; but theft especially: insomuch that a man in Cambalu taking a paile of milke from a womans head, and beginning to drink thereof; was vpon

the womans outery apprehended, and presently cut in sunder with a sword; so that the blood and the milke came out together. The next capitall crimes to these are lying & adultery; which among the very first lawes of Cingis, were enacted to be punishable also by death.
               This Country is vnder the same clime with Muscovia. The chiefe riuer of the Precopenses, is Tanais: of Asiatica, Volga,

This last is a fatall bound of Monarchies: the Persians neuer passed it to extend their dominions, but receaued some notable ouerthrowe, as that of Cyrus against the Scythians: and the Tartars fare in the same manner attempting the like matter, as when Saba the Cham of Zagataie, was ouerthrowne by Ismael Sophie of Persia. These two last arise from the branches of Mount Taurus, & exonerate their full stomackes into the Caspian or Hircanian Sea.
               Thus much of Tartaria.

               INDIA is bounded on the East with China, on the West with the riuer Indus, from whence it taketh denomination; on the North with Tartarie, on the South with the Ocean.
               This Country extendeth in length from China to Persia, 3600 miles; and stretcheth from Taurus to the Ocean: this being the biggest country, comprehended vnder one name, of any in the world, excepting Tartaria and China. It is situate betweene the first and sixt Climats, the longest day being in the South parts of 12 houres only; but in the North fifteen houres and a halfe.

                     •
                  ous fables which fore-going times haue deliuered vnto vs, giue me leaue to say; that as the Poets of old, vsed to fill vp the times of which they were ignorant, with strange fictions, & prodigious metamorphoses; or as our

moderne Geographers in their Maps of the world, fill vp those vnknowne parts thereof, of which they can giue vs no certaine description, with strange pictures, and vncouth shapes of beasts and trees: so also the writers in former ages, haue filled the more remote Countries of which they knowe little, with such impossible and incredible relations. Hence there haue beene attributed to this India, the tales of men with dogges heads; of men with one legge only, yet of great swiftnesse; of such as liue by sent; of men that had but one eye, & that in their foreheads; and of others whose eares did reach vnto the ground. It is reported also, that this people by eating a Dragons heart and liver, attain to the vnderstanding of the languages of beasts; that they can make themselues, when they list, inuisible; that they haue two tubbes, whereof the one opened yeelds winde, the other raine, and the like. But of these relations & the rest of this straine, I doubt not but the vnderstanding Reader knoweth how to iudge, and what to beleeue; for my part I am of the same minde with Curtius, Plura equidem transcribe quàm credo; nec enim affirmare ausus sum quae dubito, nec subducere sustineo quae accepi.
               
               The old inhabitants of this Country were the Daedalae, Mazaga, Abisarae, Sop

                     ites, Gangarides, Phartasii, Sobij, Malli, Sabracae, Musicani, Oxydracae, &c. all conquered by Alexander in his expedition into this Country. The Malli and Oxydracae are most famous, for a story attributed vnto thē, which is this. Alexander besieging the chiefe Citty of the Oxydracae, saith Curtius (of the Malli, saith Plutarch) was the first that scaled the walls, and the last that could doe so; the ladder breaking as soone as he was at the top. Standing thus alone as a marke to all their darts, he was by his Souldiers desired to leap downe among them; but he in a daring brauado leaped into the towne among his enimies: where it was not only his good hap to light vpon his feet, but to haue an old tree at his back to defend him behinde. In this posture he is said to haue maintained the fight a long time against all the townsmen; killing two of them with his owne hands, and by that example teaching the rest to bee more mannerly: till being wearied and dangerously wounded,

he was forced to leaue his feet, and commit the weight of his body to his knees. In this case Leonatus Peucestes, and some other of his Captaines came to assist him, who defended their dying master, till the whole Army entred the Towne, and put all the people to the sword; in reuenge of their King, whose life they had little hope to enioy, though he with much danger did afterward recouer. For my part, I giue little or no credence to this story, ranging it in the same catalogue of truth with the aduentures of Donzel del Phoebo, Rosicleer, Beliauis, Amadis, and the rest of the rabble of Knights errant: neither is this the first time that Curtius hath disgraced the soundnesse of Alexanders iudgement, and the truth of his actions, with the like idle and impossible tales, though indeed in this particular he saith that it was multò magis ad temeritatis quàm ad gloriae famam.
               
               The principall riuers of this Country are, 1 Indus the boundary of the Persian and Indian Empires; which hauing his head in the mountaine Caucasus, now called Naugrariot; openet

                   himselfe with two mouthes into the Indian Ocean; hauing first runne a course of 900 miles. 2 Ganges, of which more anon. 3 Hydaspes, on whose banks Alexander built Bucephalia in honour of his horse Bucephalus there dying. On the bankes of this riuer stood the Citty of Nysa also, the chiefe Citty of India in the time of Alexander. 4 Acesines. 5 Hirotis. and 6 Zaradus; all three emptying themselues into the Indus.
               
               This Country, euen in ancient times hath beene noted for abundance of all things, either necessary for the maintenance of life, or pleasant to the relish of the palate: as also for abundance of Camels, Apes, Dragons, Serpents, Rhinocerots, & Elephants. These Elephants doe seeme to haue a smack of reason, and certainely partake more of humane ingenuitie, then any othe
                     •
                   brute creature whatsoeuer. The Elephant which King Porus rode on, seeing his master strong & lustie, rushed into the thickest of Alexanders Armie; but when he perceaued Porus to grow faint, he withdrew himselfe, and kneeling down receaued all the arrowes shot against his master in his owne trunke.
               
                  Bacchus was the first that entred and conquered this Country, as indeed what regions first or last hath not he brought vnder

his winie Empire. Hence one thus descanteth,

                     First Bacchus did this Country ouer-runne,
                     And set vp trophies in the conquered East:
                     Oh would he had gone on as he begunne,
                     And neuer turned to subdue the West.
                     Might Indus banks haue borne his branching vines,

After Bacchus, Semiramis Q. of Assyria was the first that euer entred India in hostile manner; part whereof she made tributary, and slew Staurobates the king thereof. Next vnto her, Alexander the great invaded it, at which time there were many kings and free Cities▪ whom the Gymnosophists perswaded to defend their liberty. These Gymnosophists were to the Indians as the Druides to the Brittaines, and are called by the Indians, Brachmanni. These are had in great reuerence: and liue for the most part, a very austere and solitary life, in caues and desarts, seeding on herbes, and wearing poore thinne weedes: and for a certaine time abstaine from all kind of vice: But that time once past, they may (as it were) by priuiledge, defloure virgins, and commit what riots they list. Others of them liue together with the people, as being their ordinary Priests. Of these Alexander surprised 10, one of which was Calanus, to whom hee propounded strange questions, and receiued strange answers. Hee first dealt with Taxiles a prudent Prince, whose kingdome was bigger then Aegypt; who both ouercame and was ouercome by Alexander in curtesie. Next with King Porus in a more hostile manner; for he discomfited his Army, and tooke Porus prisoner, who was foure cubits and a shafes length high. Afterward he sailed downe the Ganges, vnto the maine Ocean; and was the first and last (till of late) that euer durst adventure such a navigation. After this expedition of Alexand

beasts till then, the Roman people had neuer seene;) and which was most pleasing, a litle boy borne without armes, who with his feet could bend a bow, shoot, and play on a winde instrument as exactly, as others with their hands. Traian the Emperour had a great desire to see this Countrie; but after these times by litle & litle, histories haue bin in a manner silent concerning it. For notwithstanding that there was continuall trafficke from the Red sea hither: and betweene the Persian, Turkish, and Indian merchants for spices, and the other commodities of this Region: yet were not these merchants acquainted with the state of the country; because they entred not into it, but were met by the Indian merchants at Sarmachand, being (as it were) the common Emporie. Neither did the Aegyptians at all enter into India, but were met by the Indians at Ormus, or some other Iland: (euen as now the Chinoys make some of the Philippinae, the staple of their trade with the Spaniards; whom they licence not to come into the Continent among them:) but our moderne navigations haue with-drawne the Maske of obscurity, and shew vs her liuely portraiture in as liuely colours. It enioyeth two summers, an exact temperature of the aire, and double increase. Abound it doth in all manner of Mineralls, except Copper and Lead: stored with all sorts of Cattle, except horses: more particularly with Mines of gold, precious stones, spices of all sorts, and Ciuet: Wheat only and Vines are wanting, that so this Countrey might be beholding to others, as others to this.

               They are now a natioo composed of 5 seuerall people, 1 the Indians or natiues, which are in part Gentiles, in part Christians. Those which are Gentiles retaine among them many of their old customes, as not knowing their wiues after they haue borne them two children; not accompanying them if after fiue yeares cohabitation they can raise no issue by them, but exchanging them for others; as neuer being rewarded for any military

exploit, vnlesse they bring with them an enemies head in their hand; killing their friends before sicknesse withereth them, &c. As for the Christians (to which Religion they were converted by S. Thomas) they still retaine the name and profession, which they haue now reformed (I should haue said deformed) according to the Church of Rome; which was effected in a Synode held for that purpose at Goa, Anno 1599, at what time they deliuered vp all their bookes to the censure of the Roman-Spanish Archbishop of Goa, to be by him corrected; and permitted their Liturgie also to be by him altered. Before this vnion, they vsed 1 to administer the Sacrament with bread seasoned with salt; 2ly insteed of wine (because India affordeth none) to vse the iuyce of rasins, softned in water one night, & so pressed forth: 3ly not to baptize their children til 40 daies old, vnlesse in danger of death: 4ly to permit no images in their Churches but of the Crosse onely: 5ly to debarre their Priests from second marriages: and 6ly to paint GOD with 3 heads on one body, denotating thereby the Trinity. The second sort of people which inhabite this Country, are Mahumetan Persians and Tartars, especially since the Moguls great victories here. 3 Iewes, who liue straglingly dispersed in all quarters. 4 Arabians, or Moores, who 200 and odde yeares past, seazed on some hauen-townes, driuing rhe Natiues vp higher into the inland Countrie. And 5 the Portugals, who possessing some few Sea-townes, commodious for trafficke, bragge of the conquest of the whole Country, which they are in no more possibility to conquer, then the French was to subdue Spaine, when he was possessed of the fort of Perpignan, pawned to him by Iohn King of Arragon and Navarre.
               
               The riuer Ganges ariseth in the Scythian hils,
                     Purchas.
                   and carrying with it an incredible breadth and depth, disburdeneth it selfe into the South Ocean. The breadth of it is in the narrowest place 8, in the broadest 20 miles; the depth of it is neuer lesse then 100 foot. That this riuer is not that which is called in the Scriptures Pison, which compasseth the land of Havilah, where there is gold; we haue already proued in Mesopotamia: our reason being drawne from the ouer-large extent which must then

be necessarily giuen to Paradise; in which the riuer Pison is said to haue risen. And though indeed India is thought, & that truely, to be the land of Hauilah; yet why should Ganges that diuideth India, be thought to be Pison, rather then Indus which boundeth it; and which also lieth farre neerer to Tigris & Euphrates, then this Ganges? But to make it more plaine: certaine it is that there were two lands of Hauilah; the one so named from Hauilah, the sonne of Iocktan, (who with his brothers Ophir and Iobab, dwelt toward the East, Gen. 10. ver. 29.30,) which is this India, or a part of it: and the other so named from Hauilah, the sonne of Chush, (of whom mention is made in the 7 verse of the same Chapter,) which is the land of Susiana, a butting North on Mesopotamia. This Ganges yet, though it be none of the riuers of Paradise, is as famous as those which are. For downe this riuer did Alexander with such danger saile to see the Ocean: To this riuer the superstitious Indians goe deuoutly on pilgrimage; strongly beleeuing that they are secure of saluation, if at the time of their death they may drinke of this water. This riuer-flowing the Country, enricheth it, as Nilus doth Egypt: and finally it diuideth the whole Countrey into two parts, viz: India intra Gangem, and India extra Gangem.

This kingdome is confined with the mountaine Guate on the West; and the Gulfe of Bengala on the East, with the mount Guadaverno on the North, and the Promontory Comari on the South: and is in compasse 3000 miles.

There are 7 Prouinces, viz: 1 Trauanear, 2 Colan, 3 Cochin, 4 Crangonar, 5 Tauo, 6 Cononor, 7 Calecute, all borrowing their names from their chiefe townes. These were all vnder one king, till about 80 yeares agoe, and somwhat more: at what time Sema Pereimal the last king, being a Mahumetan; and intending to finish his dayes in Mecha; diuided his kingdome into 6 parts, giuing them to sixe of his kinsmen. Fiue of these at this day are vnder the great Mogul, the other obeyeth the K. of Calecute, who is able to bring into the field 100000 fighting men; of whose valour the Portugals haue had often experiment, but alwayes to the losse of the Indians. The chiefe of these townes are Cononor, pleasantly seated for trafficke, as

hauing a harbour no lesse safe, then capacious: it is distant from Calecute 10 leagues. 2 Coccinum, or Cochin, distant from Calecute 30 leagues. The gouernour of this Town is the Pope or summus Pontifex of the Brachmans: and 3 Calecute, which for 3 miles together lyeth along the Sea shore It is a custome here for the King to giue to some of the Brachmanni, the hanselling of his nuptial bed. For which cause not the kings, but the kings sisters sonnes, succeed in the kingdome; as being more certainly knowne to be of the true royall blood: and these sisters of his, choose what Gentleman they please, on whom to bestow their virginities; & if they proue not in a certain time to be with child, they betake themselues to these Brachman stallions. Calecute is a famous mart town, & the staple of al the Indiā

               3 BALASSIA, or the kingdome of Bocan, is famous for its inexhaustible Mines of Gold and Siluer; the chiefe Cities are 1 Balassia, 2 Bocan, whence the duplicity of the kingdomes name: the first is seated on the riuer Gaibon; the last was once the seat of her own Kings. 3 Senergian.

                   on the North Dulcinda; on the South the Ocean. It is a Country very fruitfull, and exceedingly thick set with men and villages, of which last here is thought to bee no lesse then 600000. It was once the seat of the Rusbeti, who are the ancient nobility of this Countrie: whom the Saracens vnder the leading of one Machumat, subdued about 160 years since. To this Machumat succeeded his sonne Mamudius, to him Badurius; who making an vniust warre against the King of Mandao, compelled him to call Miramudius a Mogul Tartarian of Zagatai to his aide: who crushed by force of Badurius, and subdued the great Kingdome of Cambaia to himselfe; and yet the armie of the Cambaian consisted of 150000 horse, and 500000 foot, he had 1000 peeces of Ordinance, 500 Wagons laden with Gun-powder & Bullets, 200 Elephants, and 500 chests full of Gold and Siluer. In this kingdome are 60000 Villages, Townes, and Cities. The chiefe whereof are 1 Ardauat once the kings seat. 2 Campanael, 3 Citor, a City of 12 miles compasse,

This Mandao was a kingdome of power sufficient, till Badureus of Cambaia oppressed it; after whose defeat, Marhumid the Mogul feazed also on this kingdome: shewing that the easiest way for a Prince to ruine his own estate, and endanger his neighbours, is to make a gap open for a forrain power, to compose a homebred dissention.
               6 BENGALA is famous for its multitude of Rhinocerots; a kingdome once free, till Echebar the Mogul vnited it to his Empire. Tbe chief Cities are Catigan and Satagan on the banks of Ganges (called also Chaberis and Guenga.) 3 Bengala, nigh vnto Sinus Gangeticus, now called the Gulfe of Bengala. Nigh vnto this towne is the place called Gongasagie, that is the entrie into the sea; in which are many fishes called Sea-dogges; into which place they which are wearie of this world, and desire to haue a quick passage into Paradise, cast themselues to be devoured of these fishes: perswading themselues that the next & readiest way thither, is through their iawes. 4 Ouros, the seat of the Bengalan kings: and 5 Banneras, seated on the riuer Ganges.

Many of the people haue their legges made after the manner of an Elephants legge, which punishment the rest thinke to be inflicted vpon them, because their Progenitours massacred the blessed Apostle. The chiefe Cities are 1 Orissa, once the Kings seat. 2 Ramana, 3 Vlna, where (if I remember aright) the women in a foolish pride, blacke their teeth, because dogges teeth (forsooth) are white.
               8 CANORA, called also the kingdome of Decan, was the

habitation of Venozarares; whom Sanosaradine king of Delli either totally cast out, or subiected to his command: and as his deputie substituted one Abdessan, to whom in that regencie succeeded his sonne Mamudza In his time Sanosaradine dying, left his sonne to inherit his estate; as able to rule so many different nations, as Phaëton to rule the Chariot of the Sun. This defect Mamudza perceiuing, made himselfe absolute King of Canora; and diuiding the whole into 18 parts, he appointed as many Lieftenants Generall to gouerne them. These 18 Captaines combining together, stripped him of all his dominions; and then falling at oddes about the extent of their kingdomes, were quickely brought vnder subiection by Adabar the Mogul.

This part of India, Maginus maketh to be the kingdome of China; but vpon what ground, or by what reason perswaded, I know not: Sure I am that Ptolomie placeth the Sinae or Chinoys, East of India, and therefore cannot be part of it. As for his diuision of India intra Gangem, into the lower, containing the Countries already described; and the higher, comprehending the Countries here vnder-named; I will not stand to examine it: well knowing this diuision to haue bin

Souldiers, and forced it: He entred the kingdome of Siam, and totally subdued it, making all the rest of his neighbours his homagers.

It is now subiect to the Portugals, who haue here an Archbishop and a Colledge of Iesuites. 2 Siam, the people whereof are very opiniatiue, that after 2000 yeares, the World shall bee consumed with fire; and that vnder the ashes shall remaine two egges, whence shall come forth one man, and one woman, who shall repeople the World anew.

This is a most pleasing city, whose statelinesse giueth name to the whole kingdomes. Here are besides the Natiues, about 30000 housholders of Arabians. 2 Odia on the riuer Cuipumo, on which 200000 boats great and litle, are continually floating: This Towne containeth 400000 families, and is the residence of the Kings of Barma. 3 Tonazarin, where they vse to hang their dead bodies, supposing it to be more honourable to be eaten of birds, then wormes.

                        Maginus.
                      is blessed with a rich soyle. and a harborous sea-shore, extending 300 miles in length, in which the principall hauen is Martabane. As for the city of Pegu, it is the fairest and most elegant City of all India; strengthned with large and defensiue walls, and adorned with neat and proportionable houses. It standeth on a riuer so named, and is distant from the sea 25 miles. The other townes of note are Tauay, and Losmin; a Towne of great commerce. This Country about the yeare 1560, acknowledged no king but her owne; whom about that time one of the Gouernours of Tangu
                     
deposed; possessed himselfe of the chiefe City Pegu; & Anno 1567, hauing discomfited the king of Siam, vnited these diuers members vnder one head: and dying, lest his new-rais'd Empire to his sonne, a Prince of a vicious and tyrannicall nature; & not more cruell to his subiects, then they disobedient to him. Whereupon preparations are made on both sides, the people to defend their liberty, the king to preserue his royalty. During these ciuill discords, the titulary King of Siam, whose late ouerthrow was not yet fully digested; came violently into the Country of Pegu: burning Corne, Grasse, and Fruits; kil

                     ing man, woman, and childe; and hauing satisfied his fury, returned to his home. This spoyle of the fruits of the earth, was but a prologue to an vnsupportable famine; which consumed all the inhabitants of this flourishing Kingdome: except such whom the Granaries of the City Pegu preserued, Anno 1598. For here the fathers deuoured their children: the stronger preied vpon the weaker; not onely deuouring their more fleshie parts, but their entrails also: nay they broke vp the skulls of such as they had slaine, and sucked out their braines. This calamity incited another tributary Prince of Tangu, to make his best advantage out of his neighbours affliction; he therefore assaulted and entred Pegu, where he found as much treasure as 600 Elephants, and as many horses, could conveniently car
                        •
                     y away. This hauock being made, he villainously murdred the King, Queene, and their children, and departed; leauing the gleaning of his spoyle to the King of Arrachan; who, Anno 1600, was expelled by the King of Siam, who inioyed it not long: for the King of Barma hauing with an Army of 100000 fighting men, and 40000 Elephants, subdued the kingdomes of Macin and Arrachan: followed the current of his victories; conquered Siam, droue the King thereof from Pegu, where he hath built a most magnificent palace; and is now the sole Monarch of the 12 kingdomes of this India.
                  
               
               A more particular relation of this king, and his new-setled estate, we cannot yet vnderstand: what his revenues are, what his gouernment, what his forces. M

From the description of the body, to proceede to that of the minde: it is said that the Chinoys are ingenuous and politicke, much delighting in proficiencie in manuall arts: for the sonne is bound to follow the fathe

In giuing almes they are bountifull to the maimed and the lame, but reiect the blinde, as being sufficiently able to get sustenance for themselues, by corporall labour, as grinding of Corne, &c.

                   hand to the right; nor as the Iewes, from the right to the left: but from the top of the leafe, downward to the bottome. Gunnes also haue bin vsed among thē time out of minde: whence they are so well conceited of themselues, that they vse to say; they themselues haue two eyes, the Europaeans one, and the rest of the people, not one.
               
                  That gunnes were in vse among them euen when Bacchus made his expedition into India (which was some three or foure yeares before or after the departure of Israel out of Egypt) Sir Walter Raleigh seemeth to affirme: because Philostratus in the life of Apollonius Tyanaeus, telleth vs, how Bacchus was beaten from a city of the Oxydracae by thunder and lightning; which he interpreteth to be the Cannon. Certainly himselfe in another place of his most excellent booke, acknowledgeth this Philostratus to haue written fabulously; and therefore no fit foundation for a conceit so contrary to probability, and the opinion of all times. Besides, whereas Dion telleth vs, that by the benefit of Thunder and Lightning from Heauen, Severus discomfited Pesceninus Niger; and by the same meanes was himselfe repulsed from the walls of Petra, in Arabia: we may (if this interpretation hold good) as easily maintaine, that Seuerus had great Ordinance in his campe, and the Arabians in their town. As for Printing, whether Iohn Gertrudenberg learned it of the Chinoys; or whether good Inventions like good wits do sometimes jumpe, I dare not determine: sure I am that hee first taught it in Europe; and as some say, in the yeare 1440. At Harlem it is said to be first practised, and at Mentz perfected. Now whereas it is by some doubted, whether the Art of Printing be auaileable to the proficiencie & aduancement of Learning, or no; I must not herein be both iudge and party: but must leaue the decision hereof to such who are not all interessed in the cause. Only this I dare boldly say, that this most exquisite Invention is too much abused, and prostituted to the lust of euery foolish and idle paper-blurrer; the Treasury of Learning being neuer so ouer-charged with the froath and scumme of foolish and vnnecessary discourses. And herein (though all nations haue their share) the Germans are most blame-worthy; whose Treatises (though neither worth the Printers hand, nor the Readers eye) flye so thicke amongst vs, euery yeare twice: that we may iustly thinke them as ouer-wise in their owne, so somewhat short of a true proportion of discretion, in our conceits. And so I leaue the Chinoys and their inventions.

               The Country is for the most part very plain, insomuch that they haue Coaches and Carts driuen ordinarily with sailes; & the seas so calme, that the small barkes in which they saile, haue only an high bough standing in the midst of them, by the helpe whereof they saile swiftly along the coasts. These plaines are tilled and sowed with all manner of fruit, of more excellency & perfection then those of the Westerne parts;
                     Boterus.
                   as also are their pearles, and the Bezoar, better then those of America. It yeeldeth an hearbe out of the which they presse a delicate iuyce, which serueth them insteed of wine; and also preserueth their health, and freeth them from those euils, which the immoderat vse of wine doth breed vnto vs. They haue two, and in some places three haruests in a yeare: few mountaines, but plaines of an hundred leagues compasse. They eate thrice in a day, but sparingly: their drinke they drinke hot, and eate their meate with two sticks of Ivory, Ebony, or the like; not touching their meat with their hands, and therefore no great filers of linnen: The vse of siluer forkes in eating with vs, with our sprucer gallants, so much vsed of late, was no doubt an imitation of this.
               The riuers and waters of all sorts runne gallantly through these plaines, with an vnspeakable profit for navigation & tillage: neither doe the waters in abundance of fish, yeeld at all to the fertility of the soyle in fruits. The chiefe riuer is Polisango.

As for the name of China it is vsed only by vs of Europe, the inhabitants calling themselues Tamans, and Tabencos; the Arabians, Tzinin; Paulus Venetus▪ Mangi; & their neighbours, Sangley: China therefore is to be deriued from the Sinae, a people, whom Ptolomie the old Geographer, knowing

the name of them, rather then the power▪ placeth in those parts: which seemeth the more probable, because the Latine Writers doe yet call it Sinarum regio. And concerning the posi

From such a number of subiects, and superfluity of Marchandise; he raiseth a reuenew of 120 millions of crownes yearely.

                  We haue said that the number of inhabitants is no lesse then 70 millions, which if it seeme incredible, may bee made probable enough: if wee consider the spaciousnesse of the Country; 2 the secret goodnesse of starres, and temperature of the ayre. 3 the abundance of all things necessary to life. 4 That it is not lawfull for the King to make any warre but meerely defensiue, and so they enioy perpetuall peace. 5 That it is not lawfull for any Chinois to goe out of the Country. And 6, that here the sea is as well peopled as whole Prouinces elsewhere: for the ships doe resemble a Citty, in them they buy, sell, are borne, & dye.

When any of them dieth they cloath him in his best apparell all perfumed, set him in his best chaire; and there all his nerest kindred kneeling before him, take their leaue with teares. When he is coffined they place him in a roome richly furnished and set by him a table full of viands and good cheere, with candles continually burning on it. Not much vnlike to which ceremonies, we finde, how whilst the funerall was preparing for Francis the French Kiug; his Statua apparelled in royal roabes, with the Crowne, Scepter, &c, was laid on his bedde: whether dinner and supper was duely serued in, with the like state and solemnity, as when he was liuing. But to returne againe to my dead Chinois; when he hath layen, as is aboue said, 15 daies; he is carried forth to his funerall, the place whereof is in the fields:

for to be buried within the walls, were a thing of all others the most wretched: hither when they are in the manner of a procession, come; they burne his body, and with it men, cattle, and other prouision, for his attendance and sustenance in the other world.
               The first King of China was named Vitei,
                  
                     Hist. of China.
                   who raigned 100 yeares: from whom to the present king, Boneg, are numbred 262 Kings; which haue swaied the regall Scepter of these parts in a continuall succession, the space of 4000 yeares and more, if we will credit the relations wee haue from thence. And which addeth to the miracle, they haue alwaies liued vnconquered, vnlesse it were in the daies of Farfar, the 242 king. He was told by prophecy, that he should bee depriued of his kingdome, by one which had 100 eyes: which 
                     •
                  ell out accordingly, when Chisanbaan (which name signifieth 100 eyes) Lieftenant to Vzan a Tartarian Prince, subdued China: which when it had beene for the space of 93 yeares vnder 9 Tartar Gouernours; was freed by the valour of one Gombu, chosen for this act by the people the 51 king of China.
               
               The greatest Courtiers belonging to this Prince are Eunuchs, whom their parents in their infancy geld to make them capeable of this preferment; and of whom there are no fewer then 160000, continually attending. His Pallace where hee is most resident is in Paquin, cōpassed with a triple wall (the outwardmost of which would well environ a large town) within which space, besides the many lodgings for the Eunuches; are Groues, Hills, Fountaines, Riuers, and the like places of pleasure: yet is it not equall in workmanship to the Pallaces of the Princes of Europe.
               
               The Empire of China did once extends its power ouer all the Orientall Ilands,
                     Boterus.
                   and, as some affirme, ouer no small part of America, and almost all Scythia. But as we finde in ancient historians, that the Romans hauing by the fury of two violent tempests, lost no fewer then 206 of their ships and gallies; resolued to abandon (and for a long time did forbeare) the Seas, which had vsed them so vnkindly: So the Chinois hauing receaued a great ouerthrowe, & losse of 800 ships, nigh vnto Zeilan; they

freed all the Ilands from obedience vnto them, and contented themselues with the bounds which nature had bestowed on them. And of their moderation herein, we haue a late example. For when the people of Corea, a small Prouince abutting on the confines of China, were inuaded by the Iaponites; they submitted themselues vnto the King of China: who hauing repulsed the enimy, and thereby cleared his own Country from danger; presently redeliuers ouer vnto the Coreans, their Towne and libertie.
               Thus much of China.

The soyle & the people participate much of the nature of China, but that the Iaponites are more superstitious, as washing their children as soone as borne, in riuers; and putting off their shooes before they enter into the dining chamber. Perhaps these may bee the Ilanders, who in meere opposition to the Chinois, put off their shooes in salutation, because they of China put off their hats: To whom our factious Puritans are fitly compared; who oppose themselues against the Papists in things decent and allowable, though this opposition be accompanied wi

of these petit Realmes, all lying about Meacum; & doth now Lord it ouer 50 of these 66 kingdomes: so that the K. of Tenze writeth himselfe the Soueraigne Prince of Iapon. This augmentation of the Tenzean kingdome, came wholy by the valour of Faxiba, the father of Taicosama now liuing; who the better to assure himselfe of his new conquests, transported the vanquished Kings from one Country to another: to the end that being remoued out of their commands, & placed among strange subiects, they should remaine weake, and without meanes to reuolt against him: a politicke and mercifull course. What the reuenewes of this King are, we cannot certainly tell, onely wee may guesse them to be very great, in that he hath two millions of gold, for the yearely rent of that Rice, which is gathered out of the possessions which he hath reserued for himselfe.
               This Iland was discouered by Antonio Mota, a Portugall, and his fellowes, An. 1542. It is much frequented by the Iesuites, of whom 200 are said to liue here; Xavier one of Ignatius first companions leading the way.

                  4 IAVA is either the greater or the lesser. The Greater is in compasse 3000 miles, and for its wonderfull fertilitie, is called the Epitome of the world. The inhabitants vse to eat the bodies of their dead friends, accounting no buriall so honourable, nor obsequie so applausiue. This is also a custome among many of the rest of the Indians,
                  
                     Herodotus.
                   and so hath beene euer since the beginning of the Persian Monarchie. Herodotus reporteth how Darius Histaspis vnderstanding this custome; and withall knowing how the Graecians vsed to burne their dead bodies: sent to the Greekes, that it was his pleasure they should eat the bodies of their dead: But they vsed all meanes of perswasion & entreatie, not to be inforced to so brutish and barbarous an obseruation. Then commanded he the Indians to conforme themselues to the fashion of the Graecians; but they also more abhorred to burne their dead, then the Greekes did to eat them. So impossible is it for a custome either to be suddainly lest off, or to seem vndecent and inconvenient. The ch

               5 BORNEO is equally diuided by the Aequinoctiall into 2 parts; putting, as it were, bound between the dominions of the king of Borneo, on the North side; & of Laus, on the South side. The Idolatrous people reuerence the Sunne and Moone, whō they deeme to be man and wife; and thinke that the starres are their children. They salute the Sunne at his rising with great reverence, repeating certaine verses. Their publike affaires are handled in the night; at which time the Counsellours of state meet and ascend some tree, viewing the heauens till the Moone rise, and then goe into the Senate house.
               6 SVMMATRA was by Aristotle in his booke de Mundo, esteemed to be the biggest Iland of the world: but modern experience hath found it otherwise; it being onely 700 miles long, and 200 broad. The Aequator cutteth through it, so that the Sunnes vicinity doth make it abundant in Pepper, Ginger, Aloes, Cassia, Silke, Gold, and Siluer. Here are 29 kings, the chiefe being of Pedir and Aceni; whose subiects are the most louing men to their enimies that are, for otherwise they would neuer eat them. They vse the skulls of their eaten enimies insteed of mony, exchanging them for their necessaries; and hee is accounted the richest man that hath most of these in his house. Here is a hill called Balalvanus which continually burneth: & here are reported to be two strange fountaines, whereof the one runneth pure Balsamum, and the other the best Oyle. The chief Citties are Daren. 2 Pazzen. and 3 Androgeda.
               
               7 The PHILIPPINAE are so called of Philip the second of Spaine, in whose time they were discouered by Legaspi a Spaniard, Ao 1564. They are in number 11000, of which 30 are vnder the King of Spaine; and haue receaued Christianitie, the rest remaining in Idolatry. The Chinoys were heretofore Lords of these Ilands, till they did voluntarily abandon them, confining their Empire within the continent. Vpon this relinquishment the people fell into ciuill warres, euery man becomming a tyrant, and the stronger preying on the weaker: which diuisions and factions gaue, no doubt, great helpes to the Spaniards in their conquest of them.
               
                  There is another great frie of Ilands ouer against China, which the Marriners affirme to be no lesse then 7448; and another skull of them about India, no fewer in number then 127000, all which laid together would make a continent as large as three foure parts of Europe, and are still groaning vnder the burden of heathenisme. These Ilands stand so nigh the one vnto the other, that they seeme not only to such as are a far to bee all but one firme land: but whosoeuer also passeth between them, may with his hands touch the boughes of the trees on the one side, and on the other. Of these and the other Indian Ilands, trauellers relate many incredible fables; as that here be hogges that haue two teeth growing out of their snowts, & as many behind their eares, of a spanne and a halfe long: a tree whose westerne part is ranke poison, and the Easterne part an excellent preseruatiue against it. They tell vs also of a fruit, that whosoeuer eateth shall for the space of 12 houres be out of his wits; and of a stone, on which whosoeuer sitteth, shall suddenly haue a rupture in his body. Wee are told also that hereabouts are taken Tortoises of that bignesse, that ten men might sit and diue within one of the shells; and that here is a tree which all the day time hath not a flowre on it, but within halfe an houre after sunne-set, is full of them. All huge and monstrous lies.
               It shall not be amisse before we leaue these Easterne Countries, to take a superficiall survey of such Castles, Townes, and Ilands, as are at this day in the possession of the Spaniards; who by this meanes are a terrour to the neighbouring Princes.
               In the Persian Gulfe they possesse the Ile of Ormus, which though it be barren, yet it standeth conueniently for the trafficque of Persia, Arabia, and India. The customes only of this little Iland, afford the King, which is a Mahumetan, 140000 Seraffs yearely. This kingdome is tributary to the Portugalls, who first fortified themselues here, Ao 1506. Of this Iland the Arabians vse to say,

                     Si terrarum orbis, quaquà patet, annulus esset,

               3 In Decan or Canora, they haue Chaul, which Misamalucco a potent Prince of these parts besieged, but could not force it, Ao 1573. They haue also Goa the Spanish Vice-Roys residence, who hath here his Councel, Chanceries, and officers. This town was beleagured by Idalcan another Prince, with 35000 horse, 6000 Elephants, and 250 peeces of Ordinance; but in vaine.
               4 In Malauar they haue Chalen and Colan.
               
               5 In Zeilan they haue fortified Columbus, bragging of one of the fairest hauens in the world.
               6 In Siam they are Lords of Malaca, and the adioyning Castle; in which when they surprised it, they found 900 peeces of Ordinance.
               7 In the Moluccoes they enioy Terenate. Yet for all these fortresses, the English and Hollanders will not be hindred from trafficke with these Indians; by which commerce what benefit accreweth to our State, I meddle not.

For in the Empire of Traiant, the Iewes inhabiting Aegypt, and the confining Countries, ioyned themselues together, and chose one Artemio their Captaine; vnder whose conduct they entred into, and laid desolate this Iland killing in it 240000 liuing soules; and not without much bloudshed were presently vanquished and slaine by Lucius the Emperours Lieftenant. Since which time the Cypriots permit no Iew to enter the Country; but come he thither voluntarily, or be he beaten in by force of tempest, they lay hands on him & put him to execution.
               This Country is famous for the birth of 1 Aesclepiades, the author of the verses so named;

               The Iland is diuided into 11 Prouinces, in which the chiefe riuers are Pedeus and 2 Tenus.
                  
                     Maginus.
                   The chiefe Citties are 1 Paphos, built, as it is by most said, by Cineras (the father of Myrrha, & father and grandfather to Adonis) who so called it in memory of his father Paphus. It was of old famous for the Temple of Venus. 2 Famagusta on the South-Sea, built by Teucer, & called Salamine: at the besieging of which town the Turkes spent 118000 great bullets. 3 Nicosiae, almost in the midst of the Country. This Towne was anciently called Fremitus, & Leucetum. 4 Amathus where Venus also was worshipped, & from whence the whole Iland was called Amathusia. 5 Ceraunia, now called Cerines, built by Cyrus when he had vanquished the 9 Kings of this Iland. 6 Arsinoe now called Lescare renowned for the groues of Iupiter.
               
               
                  Cyprus was first made a kingdome by Teucer, who after the Troian warre came hither: afterwards it was diuided betweene nine petty Princes, all of which were subdued by Cyrus the first Monarch of the Medes and Persians. His Empire being subuerted by Alexander, this Iland was giuen to the Ptolomies of Egypt: from whom M. Cato conquered it to the benefit of the Roman Empire. The treasure which Cato found here in ready mony and moueables, amounted vnto 7000 Talents: which he fearing to loose by Sea, diuided the summe into many small portions, which he put into seuerall boxes, viz: in euery box 2 Talents and 500 Drachmas. At the end of every box he fastned a long rope with a peece of corke at the end; by which floating aboue the water, the money if by shipwrack it were lost might be espied again: which were not much vnlike the buoyes which Marriners fasten by long ropes to their anchors, that they may be the sooner found. The pretence of the Romans to this country was very weake, Avarius magis quam iustius sumus assecuti, are the words of Sextus Rufus. Cyprus being made a Romane Prouince, was in the diuision of the Empire assigned to the Constantinopolitan Emperour,
                     Turk. hist.
                   and gouerned by a succession of Dukes, till the yeare 1184. At this time, Andronicus Comnenius vsurping the Greeke Empire, compell'd Isaacius Comnenius,
                  
one of the bloud royall to shift for himselfe; who seasing on this Iland made himselfe king hereof, and ruled till the yeare 1191. In which Richard the first of England, being denied the common curtesie of taking in fresh water; and seeing the Souldiers abused by the Cypriots, not only tooke the King prisoner, but subdued the whole Iland. And as Paterculus telleth vs, that when Marcus Antonius had captiued Artamasdes king of Armenia, Catenis, sed ne quid honori d
                        •
                     esse, aureis vinxit. So did our Richard keepe herein a decorum toward this prisoner, binding him not in bonds of iron, but siluer. King Richard hauing thus possessed himselfe of this Country, sold it for ready mony, (which for the managing of his intended wars against the Turks he most needed) vnto the Templers; and taking it vpon I know not what discontent againe from them, he bestowed it on Guy of Lusignan, the titulary and miserable king of Hierusalem, receauing in way of exchange the title of that lost and shipwraced kingdome, with which title he and some of his successours were for a time honoured. In the posterity of this Guy, this Iland continued free and absolute till the yeare 14
                     •
                  3, when Melechella (or Melech
                        •
                     aset) Sultan of Aegypt, inuaded this Country, took Iohn, king hereof prisoner, ransomed him for 150000 Sultanies, restored him to his kingdome, and imposed on him & his successours, the yearely tribute of 40000 crowns. This Iohn was father to another Iohn, whose two children were Carlotte a legitimate daughter, and Iames a bastard sonne. Iames after the death of his father, dispossessed his sister Carlotte of the Crowne, by the consent and helpe of the Sultan of Aegypt; and the better to strengthen himselfe against all opposition, he took to wise Catharina Cornerie, daughter by adoption to the Venetian Senate. Her, he dying made his absolute heire; and she seeing the factious nobility, too head-strong to bee bridled by a female autority, like a good child, resigned her Crowne and Scepter to the Venetian Senate, An. 1473. These defended it against all claimes (paying only as tribute to the Egyptian, and after to the Turkish Sultans, the 40000 Crownes) till the yeare 1570; when Mustapha generall of the Turkes wrested it from the Venetians to the vse of his master Selimus the second, who

pretended title to it as Lord of Egypt. The gouernour of the Venetian forces at the time of this vnfortunate losse, was Signior Bragadino; who as long as hope of succours, meanes of resistance, or possibility of preuailing continued: with incredible valour made good the towne of Famagusta, in whose defence consisted the welfare of the whole Iland. At last hee yeelded it on honourable conditions, had they beene as faithfully kept, as sincerely agreed on. For Mustapha the Turkish Generall inuiting to his Tent the principall men of worth in the Town, caused them all to be murdered: and as for Bragadino himselfe, he commanded his eares to be cut off, his body to be flead aliue, & his skinne stuffed with straw to be hanged at the maine yard of his galley. The chiefe of the prisoners and spoiles, were in two tall ships and one gallion sent vnto Selimus, but hee neuer saw them: for a noble Cyprian Lady destinated to the lust of the Grand Signieur; fired certaine barrells of powder; by the violence whereof both vessells and bootie were in part burned, in part drowned. A famous and heroicke act. The yeare after this losse, the Venetians wonne the battle of Lepanto; which so fleshed them, that they said that their little losse in that fight was but as a bloodletting for the generall good: but a Turke ingeniously compared the losse of Cyprus to the losse of an arme, which could not without a miracle be recouered; and the losse of Lepanto battle to the shauing of ones beard, whose haire groweth the thicker: For the next yeare the Turke shewed his Armada whole and entire, brauing with it the whole Christian forces.
               What the reuenue of this Iland is I cannot certainely determine.
                     Maginus.
                   The profits of salts only and the custome house yeelded to the Signeur of Venice, when it was in their hands, a million of Crownes yearely. For these customes and profits were farmed for 500000 Crowns a yeare, which being turned into the chiefe Cypriot commodities, were at their vnlading in Venice counted double worth the mony. To this adde the lands belonging to the former kings, & now by deuolution to this state; and the reuenue cannot but be much more.

               OF RHODES.
               RHODOS, or RHODES, is situate in the Carpathian Sea, ouer against Caria a Prouince of lesser Asia. It is in circuit 120 miles, and taketh denomination from Rhodes the chief Citty, honoured with the mighty Colossus; made by Chares of Liudum, in the space of 12 yeares. This Colossus was made in the image of a man, being 80 cubits high, and so bigge that the little finger of it was as bigge as an ordinary man: the brasse of this statua was so much, that when Mnaui generall of Caliph Osmen, vnited this Ile to the Mahumetan Empire; it loaded 900 Camels. This image was made in honour of the Sunne, who once a day at least kisseth this Iland; bee the ayre in all other places neuer so ouercast with clowdes: And it is by some said that from hence the people were called Colossians. Whether this be a truth or a coniecture I wot not, certainely they were not those Colossians, to whom S. Paul directed one of his Epistles, they being inhabiters of Anatolia, & there haue we made mention of them.
               The people of this Ile were alwaies very expert in maritine affaires, and are called by Florus, Populus Nauticus. They aided the Romans against Philip king of Macedon; and when all the other Ilands of the Mediterranean reuolted to Mithridates of Pontus, this only adhered to the Romans. And Pate

It fell in diuision of the Empire to the Graecians, from whom the Sarracens tooke it and held it, til that the knights of S. Iohn in Hierusalem, being vtterly driuen out of

                  Asia by the Turkes, ceased on it; 1308. These knights sorely infested the Turkes till the yeare 1522, in which Solyman the Magnificent inuaded it; and Lilladamus Villiers being great Master desended it as farre as humane puissance, or warlike pollicie could extend; but multitude ouermastred valour, and on Christmas day, the Turk entred Rhodes as conquerour. Though he might say (as Pyrrhus once said of his victory ouer the Romans) that such another victory as that would haue vndone him; he lost so many of his best Souldiers, and brauest commanders. The Towne Rhodes whereof the Iland taketh its name, and on whose strength both formerly & at this time dedendeth the welfare of the whole Iland; is situate on the East part of the Ile, on the bottome of a hill, and the brinke of the Sea: so that it enioyeth a faire and a safe hauen for commodity, and for strength hath two walls, 13 high Towres, 5 bulwarks, besides diuers sconces and outworks; this towne and Famagusta being indeed the two most defensible holds in all the Turkish Empire. It is inhabited only by Turks and Iewes, the Christians hauing free commerce and traffice in it all the day time: but on paine of death leauing it at the night time. It was formerly a famous Vniuersitie, this Rhodes, Marseils, Alexandria, Athens, and Tarsus being the old Academies of the Romane Monarchie: and hither Tiberius withdrew himselfe, when Augustus had declared Caius and Lucius to be his heires; pretending only a desire to study, whereas the true cause was his enuy of the young Princes preferments.
               West of Rhodes, betweene it and Crete, lieth Carpathos, an Iland of 70 miles circuit, now called Scarpanto: famous only in causing the adiacent waters to be called the Carpathian Sea.

This Isthmus is but 60 miles in length, so that diuers haue begun a Trench to let in the Mediterranean: as first Sesostris; secondly Darius the King of Persia and Egypt; thirdly one of the Ptolomies; and fourthly a capricious Portugal; that an easier way might be found toward India, and the Easterne Countries: but they all desisted on the same reason, viz: lest the Sea (being obserued to be higher then Egypt) should sometimes ouer-flow the Country,

                and spoile the waters of Egypt. A greater proiect then this we now recited, was by Cleopatra the last Queene of the Ptolomean line in Egypt, attempted on this Isthmus, which was this: When Marke Antonie was by Augustus encountred in the Navall battail at Actium, Cleopatra fearing the successe, fled out of the battail with the 60 ships appointed to her guard. Being come to the North part of this Isthmus, she gathered together all her portable riches, & intended to hoist her shipping out of the Mediterranean sea, and hale them ouer this Isthmus into the Red sea: whence shee had intended to take saile, and together with her Antonie, and some of her choyce fri

            The old Geographers knew very litle of this Country, supposing most or all beyond mount Atlas, not to be inhabited; because it is situate vnder the Torrid Zone, and therefore tooke its name from

Pomponius Mela guessed the more inward parts thereof to be inhabited with strange people, as 1 Augilae, whose wiues on the marriage night, vsed to prostitute themselues to all commers; she being had in most honour, which had that night accompanied most men. But after that night, coniugall chastity was highly prized among them. 2 Gampsaphantes, a naked people, and ignorant of the vse of weapons. 3 Blem

These people (as he thought) possessed some small part of the Country; the rest he knew not, or with others deemed it inhabitable. But later discoueries haue seene the cō

The battle of Merida ruinated the power of those nations; so that the Vandals could not but willingly accept the offer of Bonifacius, the Emperors Vicegerent in Africa; who stomaching to see his office bestowed on Castinus, an vnworthy man, and his Enemy; betrayed the Country to these Vandals, in the last yeare of the life & reigne of Gundericus.

This Eudocia was wife to the Westerne Emperour Valentinian; who hauing a minde to a Lady of Rome, the wife of one Maximus; he cunningly slipped Maximus Ring off his finger, and by that token sent for the Lady to come to Court, & when she was come, rauished her. To reuenge this disgrace, Maximus slew Valentinian, made himself Emperour, and forced Eudocia to be his wife. But she stomaching a match so vnequall to her high birth, and hauing some incling of the manner of her husbands death, sent for Gensericus into Italy. This Gensericus conquered Carthage, and Hippo, and reigned 40 yeares.

               Belisarius, after this good seruice, was imployed by Iustinian against the Gothes then raigning in Italy; against whom he proceeded very fortunatly. But being on I know not what envy called to Constantinople, his eyes were put out, and he was faine to beg his bread, at the gate of the Temple of S. Sophia. A bad reward for so good a seruant.

Those Souldiers on a superstitious feare, would not fight on the Sunday: but the Romans hauing no such scruple, assaulted them, and put them all to the sword; leauing not one to carry newes of this ouerthrow. I dare not so far put my sickle into this Haruest, as to limit out the extent of Sabboth-keeping; which commanding vs to doe no worke, doth seeme to prohibit vs to work for our own safe-guard. Neither can I impute this abstinence from defence, to Religion, but superstition: for workes of necessity are allowed by the best Diuines, as consonant to Gods Word, to be done on that day. But on a meere fancy to destroy our selues, and bereaue God of that glory, which resistance might yeeld in such a case; is not only not cō

Captain obseruing, vsed no assault on the week dayes; but Saturday being come, with all his forces he assaulted the Town, & in the end on that day, took it. Vpon the same aduantage, was it afterwards taken by Sosius and Herode; and on the same, a third time, by Titus Vespasian: the Iewes being all this while so superstitiously sottish, that no example or danger would moue them to repulse the enemy.

Now concerning the other workes allowed on this day, as those of charity and Religion, together with those of magnificence, (as the adorning of our bodies with our better rayment, and the furnishing of our Tables with more hospitable prouision) I will here say nothing, as not pertaining to my story of the Gothes discomfiture, whose superstition occasion'd me to digresse so farre. To conclude all, let me tell you how a Iew (which people to this day doe very strictly and superstitiously obserue their Sabboth) being at Alexandria, and refusing to take ship, when the wind serued very happily to saile into Palestine, because it was Saturday; the better to cousen his conscience, hired a Ianizary to beat him aborde; which taske the Ianizary partly in loue to knauery, and partly in hate to the Nation, performed not by halfes, and in jest; but lashed him sorely, and to the purpose.

It contained 21 miles in circuit: the Citizens were called Poeni, and are still infamous for their periury, and false hearted dealing. That they were of the Canaanitish race, may be proued, 1 by the name Poeni, or Phoeni, litle differing from the Phoenices. 2ly we find in Herodotus, how Cambises hauing totally conquered Aegypt, intended a warre against the Carthaginians, who were then a state (it seemeth) of some power; but the Phoenicians, being the only sea-faring men, Cambises then had absolutely denied to be agents in that seruice; they being sprung from the same tree that the Carthaginians were. 3ly we read in Procopius, (out of whom it is cited by Evagrius Scholasticus) how on two marble pillars, situate nigh vnto Tingis, or Tanger, there was in the Phoenician language and character engraued, Nos fugimus à facie Iosuah praedonis, filij Nave. This last we before touched.
               The Common-wealth of Carthage was in these parts so potent, that they stroue with the Romans tooth and naile for the Empire of the World, but lost their owne liberty, being ouerthrowne in 3 seuerall warres by the Romans. The first was for the possession of Sicilie, Sardinia, and Corsica: The second was begun by Hannibal, who terrified the Romans with many fatall ouer-throwes; but was at last ouercome by Scipio, hauing kept the Romans worke 18 yeares; and then this great City submitted. But being vnwilling to endure such a mutation, from being Queene of Africa, to be a handmaid to Rome, she again revolted, and was vtterly razed to the ground. Caesar after rebuilt it, and planted therein a Colonie of the Roman people. It grew in small time to be frequently inhabited, and abounding in riches: yet so farre from her ancient reputation, that her chief glory was to be rather sought in her ancient, then present fortunes. Populi Romani colonia, olim imperij eius pertinax aemula; &

priorum excidio rerum, quam ope praesentium clarior: was her true character in the Geographer Mela's dayes. Long after this in the flourishing of Christianity in these parts, the Archbishop hereof had vnder his iurisdiction 120 Suffragan Bishops. Out of the ruines and cinders of Carthage, finally destroyed by the Vandals, and Saracens; like the yong Phoenix out of her dams ashes, arose Tunis, a City of 9000 families, seated nigh vnto a most delicate safe harbour,

               This Country was called Numidia, containing also Africa propria, and was the Kingdome of Masinissa, whom his sonne Micipsa succeeded; after whose death, Iugurth hauing kill'd his brethren Adherbal, and Hiempsal, manfully withstood the Romans; whose attempts sometimes by force, sometimes by subtilty but chiefly by money and bribes, he ouer-threw & made frustrate: & fuit in Iugurtha (saith Florus) quod post Annibalem timeretur. At last being broken by Metellus, vanquished by Marius, and by Boechus deliuered into the hands of Sylla: he was by Marius led in triumph vnto Rome. In this triumph was carried 3700 pound weight in golde; in siluer wedges 5775 pound weight; and in ready coyne, 28700 Crownes: it being the custome of the Romans in their triumphs, to haue carried before them all the riches and money, which they had brought out of conquered Countries, to put into the common Treasurie. Thus besides others did Paulus Aemylius, when triumphing for his victory ouer Perseus king of Macedon, he caused the ready money which he had brought out of Greece, to be carried in 750 vessels; euery vessell (as Plutarch relateth) containing 3 talents: a masse of treasure so infinite, that the Roman people were for many yeares after, free from all kind of taxe & imposition.
               After the death of Iugurth, who at Rome was starued in prison; Numidia was giuen to some of the confederate Kings of the Romans; whose guise it was (as Tacitus noteth) habere servitulis instrumenta etiam reges. The first King was Hiempsal,
                  
who relieued Marius in exile: the second was Hiarba, an other of the Marian faction, vanquished by Sylla's Captaines. The third was a second Hiempsal, sonne (if I e

The last was Iuba, sonne to this Hiempsal, of whom, more annon: who being slain, Numidia was made a Roman Prouince, Crispus Salustius being the first Lieftenant of it. The Romans lost it to the Saracens, after whose conquest this Prouince had many Kings, all forced to bow vnder the command of the Kings of Morocco: one of whose Deputies in these Countries, vsurped the soueraignty, and left it intire to his posterity: who peaceably enioyed it, till Muleasses the yongest son of Mahomet, hauing kill'd his eldest brother, and put out the eyes of 20 of the other, tooke on him the kingdome. Roseta the only one, which escaped this massacre, by the aide of Solyman the magnificent, regained, and was enforced to leaue it as a prey to Muleasses, by the valour of Charles the fift, and his Castilians, Anno 1535. After many troubles this tyrant had his eyes put out by his son Amida. He was dispossessed by his brother Mahomet: In whose life, the Turkes razed the Spanish fort of Goletta; and after his death, succeded him in his kingdome of Tunis.

He was after the ouerthrow & death of Pompey, encountred and discomfited by Caesar himselfe; who presently made Numidia a Prouince of the Empire, giuing Mauritania to Bacchus and Bogud, two of his consederates. These continued not long friends: for during the succeeding

                  Triumvirate, Bacchus dispossessed Bogud of his part, and was confirm'd in both by Augustus Caesar: but he suddenly after dying, the whole Country of Mauritania, as well this called Caesariensis, as that other called Tingitana, were Prouinces of the Roman Empire, and so it continued, till the Vandals, and after them the Saracens made hauocke of it.

These long enioyed the benefite of proprietary Princes, till such times as Selimes, and Mahomet, falling out, made the first, & that an irreparable breach in the gouernment; for Selimes to strengthen his side, implored the aide of Hairaccius Barbarossa, a noble Pirat; who taking his best advantage, slew the dis

The two kingdomes were thus ioyntly gouerned, till the yeare 1212; in which, when Alphonso King of Castile had slaine King Mahomet Enaser; and his sonnes were at oddes about the inheritance: one Habdulach, of the Marine Family, made himselfe King of Fesse; and by the valour of his sonne Ioseph, made Morocco tributary. This Habdulach by cō
                  putation of time, seemeth to be the Admiralius Murmelius, mentioned by Mathew Paris, to whom our King Iohn, Anno 1214, sent such a base, degenerous, and vnchristian-like embassage. This strange name Admiralius Murmelius, was by that good Writer vnhappily stumbled on, insteed of Miramumalim; which also is corrupted from Amir Elmumenin, that is, princeps fidelium; an attribute which these Princes as yet retain. The story is this. King Iohn being ouer-laide in his Barons warres, sent certaine Embassadours to this great Monarch for aide; offering to hold his kingdome of him, and to receiue the Law of Mahomet. The Moore maruailously offended with this offer, told the Embassadours, that he had lately read Paules Epistles, which he liked so well, that were he now to chuse a Religion, he would before any other embrace Christianity; but euery one ought (said he) to die in his owne Religion, and for leauing the Faith wherein he was borne, was the onely thing which he disliked in that Apostle. This said, he called vnto him Robert of London, Clearke, one of that Embassie, of whom he demaunded the forme of our gouernment, the wealth and situation of the Country, the manners of the people, the life and person of the King; in all which particulars being satisfied, he grew into such a dislike of our king, that euer after he abhorred the mention of him. In the posterity of this Habdulach, the two Kingdomes remained, till the yeare 1508, when as Mahomet Ben Amet, called by his own command Xeriff, (which is the name that the lineall successours, and kindred of Mahomet are called by) being a poore Hermite, plotted to make his sonnes

the chiefe Princes of Mauritania Tingitana. For this cause, he sent them in pilgrimage to Mecha, whence they returned with such an opinion of Sanctity, that the King of Fesse made Amet, one of them, Gouernour of the famous Colledge Amadorac; & Mahomet, the other, Tutor to his children: the yonger, Abdel, staying at home with their father. In those dayes, the Portugals grieuously infested the tributary kingdome of Morocco

               This Country takes its name from the Numidae, which may perhaps be so called from their manner of life, which is after the custome of the Nomades, liuing without houses, vner their Wagons, and Carts, as Lucan testifieth of them.

And worthily may they owe their names to them, from whom they borrow their nature: for the people to this day spend their liues in hunting, and stay but three or foure daies in a place, as long as the grasse will serue the Camells. This is the cause why this Country is so ill peopled, the Townes so small in themselues, and so remote from others. An example hereof is Te

The Country aboundeth with Dates, whence it is called Dactylorum regio, and in the Arabicke Biledulgerid, which signifieth also a Date region. These Date tree▪ are some male, some female; the first bringeth forth only flowres; the other, fruit: yet herein is the male beneficiall to the increase of the Dates: for vnlesse a flowred bough of the male, be ingrafted into the female, the dates neuer proue good. This fruit is the chiefe diet of the people; but this sweet meat hath sowre sawce; for it commonly rotteth their teeth betimes: as for the stones of these Dates, they feed their Goats with them, whereby they growe fat, and yeeld store of milke. It is ill inhabited, by reason of the abundance of sands, so that in some places the towns are 300 miles distant. The ayre is of that nature, that if any one bee troubled with the French disease, he shall here finde present remedy. The inhabitants are base and vile people, theeues, murderers, & ignorant of all things: but the Arabians that are mingled with them, are ingenious, liberall, and ciuill.

               The name of Lybia is to be deduced either from Lybs a king of Mauritania, or Lybs the South winde, which gently breatheth from these places; or from Lybia a Queene hereof. It is now called Sarra, which signifieth a desart: for the whole country is full of great sandy desarts, to which the violent heat of the Sunne addeth continuall nourishment.

                     Hence Lybia, all its moisture drawne on high
                     By the attractiue Sunne, is made so dry.
                  
Those desarts are so tedious, that Marchants vse commonly to trauell eight daies, without sight of any riuer, lake, bush, or tree. The greatest are of Azacad, and Zanhaga.
               
               The people differ not much from the Numidians; but if there be a worst, certainely it must fall to the Lybians share. They worship a God called Psaphon, who, when he liued, taught divers Birds which he caught, and then set at liberty, to say, that Psaphon was a great God: wherevpon the simple people, smitten with admiration, afforded him diuine worship.
               The chiefe Citties are 1 Huaden. 2 Guargata, and 3 Toherraum.
               
               The people in matters tending to religion, are heathens, for the most part; but some there are of the naturalls, among whō the Saracens, comming out of Arabia and Barbarie (Countries almost totally Mahumetan) haue planted their superstition: & in matters of pollicy, both these nations follow one methode, hauing no king nor lawes; but are gouerned by the chiefe man in euery Tribe.
               Thus much of Numidia and Lybia.

The inhabitants doe almost want the vse of reason, most alienat from dexterity of wit, and all arts and sciences, prone to luxury & are for the greater part Idolaters, though not without some small admixture of Mahumetans, & Christians. When the Portugalls first sailed into these coasts the people hereof took their ships for great Birds with white wings: and after, vpon better acquaintance, they could not be brought to beleeue, but that the ey

The very Nobles, (if so noble a name may without offence be giuen to so blockish a people) are so stupid, that when they are in presence of their king, they neuer looke him in the face, but sit flat on their buttocks, with their elbowes on their knees, and their hands on their faces: & for their greater gallantrie, they annoint their haire with the fat of fishes, which maketh them stinke abominably.
               The Country is abundantly stored with gold and siluer, very fine and pure: so that had not the Portugals affected the honor of discouering new worlds, as much as wealth; they might haue made as rich a factory here, as at the Indies.
               
               It is so called, either because the people are of a blacke colour, or from the riuer Niger. This riuer from the fifteenth day of Iune, ouerfloweth al the adiacent fields, the space of 40 daies And in so many more recollecteth his waters, into their proper Channels: the whole country being indebted to these inundations, for its fertility, which otherwise could be but small; since

the drinesse of the soyle can afford no exhalations, whereby clowdes may be generated, and the earth refreshed with moysture. This riuer hideth his Channell vnder ground, the space of six miles. The second riuer of note is Senega, vpon whose Northerne Banke, the people are cole blacke; but on the south only tawnie.

               OF AETHIOPIA SVPERIOR.
               
                  PRius diuidenda antequam definienda sunt aequivoca, is as vndoubted a truth in nature, as a true rule in Logicke: and therefore before I come to the particulars of Aethiopia, I will cleere my passage, in respect of some ambiguity of the na
                     •••
                  . For, whereas the Interpreters of the Bible in all lang
                     •
                  ages, render the word Cush by Aethiopia, and the Cushites by Aethiopians: they therein giue occasion to many incongruities in sense, and reason. For should we suppose the riuer Gihon, mentioned in the second of Genesis, to compasse about this Aethiopia; we should make Paradise to be of too large extent. 2ly, Whereas it is said in the second of Chron: cap. 14. that Zerah king of the Aethiopians, came against Asa, with an hoast of a million and 300 Chariots: this cannot properly be attributed to this Aethiopia, both, for that it is likely that the king of Egypt, would neuer suffer so huge an army to passe through his Country; and for that we finde in the same chapter, how Asa, to reuenge this inrode, destroyed the Citties of Zerah, euen vnto Cera; which is well knowne to stand in Arabia Petraea on the South border of Iudaea. 3ly, Whereas it is said in the 29 of Ezechiel, that the land of Egypt should be laid wast from the towne of Siene, to the borders of Aethiopia: if it bee meant of this place it cannot be good sense; Siene being the very border towne, betwixt Egypt and Aethiopia; and is as if one should say, the English conquered all France, between Callice and Douer. Aethiopia therefore mentioned in these and sundry other places, must bee conceaued to be the land of Chus, or the Cusi

to dislike all translations, one distinction will salue all; which before I set downe I must tell you, (referring the first peopling of this Country till anon) that the Graecians gaue it the name of Aethiopia, from

               Now that you may not suspect this distinction to be meerly fained, and gathered vpon no grounds; see what I haue transcribed out of Herodotus, speaking of the expedition of Xerxes, against the Greekes.

                  , &c. Arsames (saith he) was Captaine of the Arabians, and the Aethiopians, that are beyond Aegypt. The more Easterne Aethiopians, were ranked with the Indians, nothing differing from the other in the structure of their bodies, but in their haire and voice only: the Easterne Aethiopians wearing their haire smooth; they of Lybia, curled. The Aethiops of Asia were armed like the Indians, &c. but the Aethiops of Africke (the very words of my distinction) were arayed with the skinnes of beasts, &c. So farre Herodotus.
               
               AETHIOPIA called SVPERIOR, because it is more north then the other: and also Interior, because it is encompassed about with the other (vnlesse where it is bounded with Lybia, and the land of Negroes North) is called also Abasine, either from Abas a prime riuer hereof, or from an Egyptian word signifying scattered nations. It comprehēdeth the regions, once called Aethiopia sub Aegypto, Trogloditica, and Cinnamomifera.

Plinie reporteth two strange things of this Country; 1 that the ayre & ground are so parching hot, that the people not only dare not goe out of dores without shooes; but that they rost their meat also by

setting it in the Sunne. 2ly That here is a lake, whose waters are thrice a day, and thrice a night, exceeding salt and vnpleasing, but at all other times most sweet and delicious to the pallat. Iosephus writeth that Moses hauing slaine the Egyptian, fled into this Country, and here married the daughter of Iethro Prince of it: but this is vtterly false, for Moses fled into the land of Madian, Ex. 2.15. which is on the other side of the red Sea, in Arabia Petraea.

               The Christian faith was first preached here by the Eunuch of Q. Candace, who was baptized by Philip the Deacon; but not totally propagated ouer the whole Empire, till the raign of Abraham, Anno 470: who in his life, entituled himselfe Defender and propagator of the religion of Christ; and was after

his death, canonized for a Saint, The particularities of their opinions, wherewith they haue infected the true purity, I finde thus registred. 1. They vse to circumcise both males & females. 2 They baptize the males 40, the females 80 daies, after their circumcision. 3 After the receit of the Sacrament they are not to spit tell Sunne-set. 4 They professe but one nature, and one will in Christ. 5 They accept only the three first generall Councells. 6 Their Priests liue by the labour of their hands, for they allow them nothing, and permit them not to begge. 7 They rebaptize themselues euery Epiphany day in lakes and ponds; because that day they suppose Christ to haue beene baptized by Iohn, in Iordan.

In this Countrey are many Sluces, Ditches, and by-channells, to curb the otherwise vncontroleable power of the riuer, which else would ouerflow all Egypt. In respect hereof the Sultans of Egypt, haue a long time paid vnto the Emperour of the Abassines, a great tribute: which when the great Turke, supposing it to be a needlesse custome, did deny; this people, by the command of their Emperour, did breake downe their dammes, and open their sluces: whereby drowning Egypt, they inforced the Turke not only to continue his tribute, but to giue them also great summes of mony for the remaking of these dammes and sluces. The fourth river of note is Zairo, which arising in the more mountainous parts, endeth his long pilgrimage in the lake Zemre. Here are also some lakes reported to be of that poisonous nature, that whosoeuer drinketh of them, either falleth immediatly madde, or is for a long time trobled with a drowsines.

                  Chus was the first Prince of this Country, Regma the 2d, & Dodan the 3d. From these kings till the time of Aruc, the people liued in Caues, and rockie holes. He taught them to build houses; and to lead the way, built Aruma. The fourth from Aruc, was Maqueda, called in holy writ the Q. of Saba, & of the South. She went to Hierusalem to heare the wisdom of Solomon, and see the order of his house: & as their stories relate, returned home great with child by Solomon. This child being borne was called by his mother, Melilech; but by Solomon, Dauid: since which, the Kings were called Dauids; till Indian the Eunuch of Q Candace returning home, baptized his young Prince, calling him Philip. Hitherto we haue spokē out of their owne Chronicles, but they we knowe are no Gospell. That Chus planted in Arabia, we haue already told you, as also what absurdities arise, from supposing the land of Chus to bee this Aethiopia: most probable therefore it is, that this country was in processe of time, peopled by the progeny of Ludim & Phu

Now whereas Stephanus hath, in his opinion, decided the controuersie, making Sheba, the sonne of Chus, the father of the Arabians; and Sheba, the sonne of Regma, the father of the Aethiopians, & for this cause hath found out a pretty criticisme that Sheba, when it was writtē with

                  , is in my opinion (as the rest of that straine are) more nice then wise; it being euident, that both Sheba the son of Chus, & Sheba the son of Regma, peopled Arabia. As for Q. Maqueda, doubtlesse she was Queene of the Sabaeans, not the Aethiopians. For, besides the longsomnesse of the iourney, too much for a woman and a Queene to trauell; it is very probable when Shisacke king

of Egypt spoyled Hierusalē, in the raign of Rhehoboam; that the King of Aethiopia, who, if this be true, was at that time the sonne of Maqueda; would not haue suffered Egypt to haue laien quiet, whiles his brother Rhehoboams Country was a wasting, if there had beene any such tie betweene them. To leaue these fables then, the first story which we meet with concerning the Aethiopians,
                  
                     Herodotus.
                   is in the time of Cambises, long after Solomon, who hauing vnited Egipt to Persia, intended also to haue vnited Aethiopia to Egypt. Vpon this motion, Embassadours were sent to trie the strength of the King, and search the passages of the Country: carrying with them as presents, a purple habit, some brace
                     •
                  ets, a box of sweet oyntments, and a tunne of wine. The Aethiopian receauing these tokens, accounted the vnguent and purple, slight and effeminate; the bracelets he openly laught at, as being too weake to hold in a prisoner (for he took them to be bonds:) only the wine he was delighted with, and sorrowed that this country yeelded no such liquor. At the dismission of these Embassadours, they were amongst other guifts, presented with a bowe of wondrous strength; the Aethiopian bidding thē tell their master, that vntill euery Persian could bend that bow, it would be no safe medling with his people: adding withall, that Cambises might thanke the Gods, for giuing the Aethiopians so contented mindes, that they thought not on conquering their neighbours kingdomes. To returne againe to our Aethiopian story, which now beginneth to be more credible. After the baptizing of the first Philip by the Eunuch, all the succeeding Emperours were called Philip; till the religious raigne of Iohn, honoured with the title of Saint: since whose death till this present time, they are called Iohns, with the praenomen, as some will of Presbyter; affirming that he executeth as well the ministeriall as the kingly office, Idem hominum Rex, divum

                      Sacerdos: But as others, and that more probably, of Pretiosus; for the word Prete-gian, by which name his subiects vse to call him, importeth no lesse. They neuer had disastrous successe in any affaires, till the yeare 1558, in which the Turks seazed on Barnagassum: and since, Anno 1603, when the last Emperour was slaine by the King of Adel. The person of this Emperour is much honoured,

nay adored by his subiects, to whom he sheweth himselfe but thrice in a yeare, viz: on Christmas, Easter, & Holyrood day: by which retirednesse he maketh his presence more acceptable, as holding nothing to be more derogatory from the Maiesty of a King, then to make himselfe too common an obiect, for the eye of the vulgar. The like kinde of state, was once kept by those kings of France, who withdrawing themselues from all publike affaires, vsed only to shew themselues (as wee haue already said) on May-day. A greater retirednesse then this, is that of which Velleda, Queene of the Tencteri, a people of the Rhene, is reported by Tacitu

                   to haue vsed. For when the rest of the Germans then in armes, sent Embassadours to her, to informe her of her victory against the Romans; they were prohibited either to speake to her, or see her; Arcebantur aspectu, quo venerationis plus inesset. Such a keeping of state, the politique Prince Tiberius vsed, when the German legions mutined; for he daigned not to goe himselfe to see them pacified, but the reason was, quia maiestati maior è longinquo reuerentia. And no doubt the same keeping of distance, swaied much with him when hee forsooke Rome, and kept Court priuatly at Caprea; though I deny not, but a propension to follow his vnnaturall pleasures, the more securely, together with the deformities on his face, had also their powers vpon his resolution.
               The title of this great and mighty Emperour, runneth thus. N.N. supreame of his kingdomes, and the beloued of God, the piller of faith, sprung from the stocke of Iudah, the son of David, the sonne of Solomon, the sonne of the columne of Sion, the sonne of the seed of Iacob, the sonne of the hand of Mary, the sonne of Nahu after the flesh, the sonne of St

conceiue themselues to be sprung from Solomon, and Maqueda (or Nizaule as Ioseph nameth her) the Queene of the South. For better confirmation whereof, it is by some reported, that the Armes of this kingdome, are the same with those of the Tribe of Iuda, which are a Lyon rampant in a field Or; & that the motto of them is to this effect, viz; The Lyon of the Tribe of Iudah shall ouercome. But Bara an expert Herald, giueth this Prince no such coat-armour: his Armes according to him being Luna, a crosse portate Mars, charged with a crucifixe Sol; betweene two scourges of the second.

               MONOMOTAPA, Bonomotapa, or Bonemotaxa, is environ'd almost round with waters; hauing on the West & South the riuer called Rio d' Infanto; on the East, the Ocean; and on the North, the riuer Quama. This Country is in compasse 450 miles, & aboundeth with such store of Elephants, that no lesse then 5000 are yearely kill'd, for their teeths sake. Here are said to be 3000 mines of Gold, the chiefe being Manica, Boro, and Quitiavi.
               
               The chiefe Prouinces are 1 Motana, 2 Tocoa, 3 Melcucba. 4 Quinibebe, 5 Berfaca, 6 Bavagal. The chiefe Cities are Monomotapa, Zimbas, and Tongum the Kings seat, where Anno 1560, one of them was christned by Gonsaluo a Iesuite, whom not long after by the perswasion of some Arabians, he caused to bee slaine.
               The people hereof are Heathen for the most part, yet they worship not idols, but beleeue in one god, whō they call Mozimo, and in some places are very prone to receiue the Faith of CHRIST. They punish nothing more seuerely then witchcraft, theft, & adultery. In the punishment of Delinquents, they

vse no prisons, but execute them assoone as they are apprehended; which is the cause that the vulgar sort haue no doores to their houses, this being an honorable priuiledge belonging to Lords onely. The King of this Country is alwayes called by the name of Monomotapa: he is serued on the knee; and when he drinketh, or cougheth, all that are about him, make such a shout, that all the Towre rings of it. All that come into his presence, must sitdown, for to stand is a signe of dignity, and the chiefe honour that can be afforded vnto any. He is said to haue for his guard 200 mastiues. The women are here much respected. The Monomotapa himselfe if he meet them in the street, giuing them the way. They are not to be married, till their menstrua, or naturall purgation, testifie their ability for conception; and therefore they solemnize the first fluxe thereof, with a great feast.
               CAFRARIA hath on the East Rio d' Infanto, on the West and South, the Ocean; and on the North, Lunae montes. It taketh its name from Cafars, which in the Arabicke signifieth Heretickes: which though common to all Heathens, is yet appropriated to this Region, as destitute of another name. This Country extendeth towards the South with a long Promontory, called Caput bonae spei, or C

The top of this Cape is a faire and pleasing plaine, adorned with great variety of flowers, and couered with a carpet of grasse; it is called the table of the Cape, and yeeldeth a large prospect ouer the Sea on all sides. The Sea here is very rough & tempestuous, & hath to the Spaniards proued oftentimes very vnkind: whereupon a Spanish Captain being sorely vexed with a storme, expostulated with GOD, why he suffred so good Catholickes to endure such torments; and permitted the English Heretickes & blasphemers to passe so easily. The people liue like beasts, are black as pitch, and therefore vse when they would represent any vgly thing, to make it white: they haue flat noses, and thick lippes. They haue some villages in which they liue together; & in euery village a king or lord to whom they are subiect.
               
                  MANICONGO hath on the East, Habassia; on the West, the Aethiopique Ocean; on the North, the land of Negroes; on the South, the hills call'd Lunae montes. These Countries were discouered by Dego Can, a Portugal, Anno 1486. They are very populous, insomuch that they sell vnto the Portugals yearely, 28000 slaues, as it is supposed; who are all carried to Brasil, there to worke in the mines. The principall Townes are 1 Benza, called by the Portugals, since they initiated this Nation in the Faith of Christ, S. Sauiours, or S. Salvedore, 2 S. Paul lying on the Sea shore, a Town built and fortified by the Portugalls, for the better assurance of their trade: and 3 Loanda, seated iust opposite to S. Paul, in an Iland of the same name; caused (as it is thought) by the mud and dirt, which the riuer Coanzo brought thither. It is the principall hauen-towne of these parts.
               This Country is watered by the riuers Bengo. 2 Coanzo. 3 Dande. 4 Loz

                     Maginus.
                  EGYPT is bounded on the East with the Red Sea; on the West, with Cyrene; on the North, with the Mediterranean; on the South, with Habassia. In the place where this Aegypt and Habassia meet, is the last cataract of Nolus; which is a fall of the waters, after much struggling with the rocks for passage, an incredible way downe into the lower valleyes. The hideousnes of the noyse which it maketh, not onely deaueth all the bydwellers, but the hills also are torne with the sound: For as Lucan:

                     Cuncta tremunt undis, & multo murmure montis
                     Spume
                           •
                        s invictis albescit fluctibus amnis.
                     The noyse the mountaines shakes, who roare in spight
                     
                        
                           Sands.
                        To see th'vnvanquish'd waues cloath'd all in white.
                  
Yet you may diuerse times see the Countrey people, in a litle boat, able to containe but two onely, venture down these falls; aed appearing after they are long lossed in the waters, a great distance off, as if they had beene shot out of an engine.
               This Country was first inhabited by Misraim, the sonne of Chus, the sonne of Cham, & was called in the Hebrew tongue Misreia: the footsteps of which name remaineth amongst the Arabians, who call it Misre. 2 It was named Oceana, from Oceanus a King hereof. 3 O
                        •
                     iriana, from Osiris. 4 Aegyptus, from Aegypt; being the surname of Rameses, a Prince of great power.
               The Country is in length from Siene, to the Mediterranean Sea, 562 miles; and in bredth, from Rosetta West, to Damiata East; about 140 miles. But it continueth not alwayes in this bredth for lessening it selfe Southwards, like a Pyramis reversed, it is in some places but 37 miles broad, & at the very point or bottome, but foure. It is situate betweene the second and the fift Climates, so that the longest day is 13 houres, and a halfe.
               The inhabitants, though this Countrey lie in the same Climate with Barbary, are not black, but tawnie and brown. They were the inventers of the Mathematicall Sciences, and are still

endued with a special dexterity of wit; but are somwhat slothfull, and giuen to riot and luxury; merry also and sociable companions. The old Egyptians are by Pomponius charactred, to haue vsed to weepe and mourne ouer their dead bodies, dawbed ouer with dung; to haue held it almost a piacle to burne or bury them, but hauing embalmed them, to haue laid them in some inward roome of their houses. The men (saith he) keepe home, and spinne; the women manage the greater businesses: the men carry burdens on their heads, the women on their backs. Not much vnlike to which last custome, they haue still one of a new stampe; for here the women pisse standing, and the men couring on their knees. They worshipped in euery Town and its Territory, particular gods; but the god by them most adored, was Apis; an Oxe, blacke all ouer his body, hauing a white starre in his fore-head, the effigies of an Eagle on his backe, and two haires only in his taile. It seemeth his deity was not much respected by strangers; for Cambises when hee conquered Egypt, ran him with his sword through the thigh, causing all his Priests to be scourged: and Augustus being here,
                     Dion.
                   would not vouchsafe to see him, saying; 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , dios se colere consuevisse, non boues, a speech worthy so braue a Prince.
               For its abundant fruitfulnesse this country was called Horreum populi Romani; and in the time of Ioseph, supplied Iacob and his Family with corne. Now also is the goodnesse of the soyle such, as is contained in these two verses of Lucans.
                  
                     Terra suis contenta bonis, non indigna mercis,
                     Aut Ievis; in solo tantatest fiducia Nilo.
                     The Earth content with its owne wealth, doth craue
                     No forreine Marts, nor Ioue himselfe; they haue
                     Their hopes alone in Nilus fruitfull waue.
                  
This Nilus hath his head either in the mountains of the Moon, or the lake Zembre in Aethiopia interior: and running in one continuall Channell, till it washeth the midland of Egypt, is before its influx into the Sea, diuided into 7 other Channels, or mouthes; namely 1 Heracleoticum, 2 Bolviticum, 3 Schaniticum, 4 Patinicum, 5 Mendesium, 6 Caniticum, 7 Pelusiacum. The

first and last of these currents being sarre distant at the Sea; and growing into one, at the first point of the riuers diuision; make the part which is called Delta. because it ve
                     •
                  embleth the Greek letter Δ. The other part is called Thebais, from Thebes, the chiefe Town of it. This Nil
                        •
                     s, from the 15 day of Iune, swelleth aboue his banks the space of 40 dayes; and in as many more gathereth his waters again to their proper bounds. If it flow not to the height of 15 Cubits, then the Earth is deficient in her abundance of increase, for want of moisture: and if the waters surmount the superficies of the Earth, more then 17 cubits; then like a drunken man it cannot produce its naturall operations, as hauing its stomach (as it were) ouer-laid, and surcharged with too much liquor: but if the meane be granted, there is no Country can brag of such abundance, the corne being all inned before the end of May. During this inundation, the beasts and cattle liue on the hills, and in the Townes, to which they are before-hand driuen; & there are, til the decrease of the waters, foddered. As for the Townes and villages, they stand all on the toppes of the hills, and at the time of the floud, appeare like so many Ilands. Commerce and entercourse is not a 
                     •
                  ot diminished; for skiffes and the like boates, supply the places of horses and camels, transporting safely and speedily, the marketmen and their commodities, from one Town to another. When the riuer doth not thus ouer-flow the Country, it is not onely the vsher to a following dearth; but prognosticateth some ensuing mischiefe to the State and Princes thereof. And it is by Authors of good credit related, that in the 10th and 11th yeare of Cleopatra, the riuer increased not: which was obserued to be a fore-teller of the fall of two great Potentates, this Cleopatra, and her sweet-heart Antonie. A second commodity arising frō this inundation of the Nile, is the health it bringeth with it; for the plague, which here often miserably 
                     •
                  ageth, vpō the first day of the floud doth instātly cease: insomuch that wheras 500 dye in Caire, the day before; the day following there dieth not one. A third strangenesse in this riuer is, that keeping its waters together, it changeth the colour of the Sea farther into the Mediterranean, then the sea can thence be discerned. A fourth miracle

is, that not in fruits onely, but in producing liue creatures also, it is euen to wonder fruitfull: as Ovid,
                  
                     Nam
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         ubi deseruit madidos septemfluus agros
                     Nilus, & antiquo sua flumina reddidit alveo;
                     Plurima cultores versis animalia glebis
                     Inveniunt—
                     For when the seauen-mouth'd Nile the fields forsakes,
                     And to his ancient Channell him betakes;
                     The tillers of the ground liue creatures finde
                     Of sundry shapes, ith' mud that's left behinde.
                  
This riuer is in length almost 3000 miles, and being the onely riuer of Egypt, affordeth the onely drinke to the Egyptians, and is of such vertue, that when Pesceninus Niger saw his Soldiers grumble for wine; what (saith he) doe you murmure for wine, hauing the waters of Nilus to drinke? On the bankes of this riuer, down towards Alexandria, stood that famous Labyrinth, built by Psamniticus. It contained within the compasse of one continued wall, 1000 houses, and 12 royall palaces, built and couered with marble. It had onely one entrance, but innumerable wayes within, turning and returning, one sometimes ouer the other, and all in a manner invious to men not acquainted. So Mela describeth it. The building was more vnder the Earth, then aboue, the marble stones being laid with that art, that neither wood, nor cement, was imployed in any part of the fabricke. The chambers were so disposed, that the doores vpon their opening, did giue reports no lesse terrible then thunder: and the maine entrance all of white marble, adorned with stately columnes, and most curious workes of imagerie. On the bankes of this riuer also, grew those sedgie weedes called Papyri, of which Paper was in former times made. They diuided it into thinne flakes, whereinto it naturally parteth: then laying them on a table, and moistning them with the glutinous water of the riuer; they pressed them together, and so dried them in the Sun. By meanes of this Invention, bookes being easier to be transcribed and reserued; Ptolomaeus Philadelphus made his excellent Library at Alexandria; and vnderstanding how Attalus king of Pergamum, by the benefit of this Aegyptian paper,

striued to exceed him in that kind of magnificence, prohibited the carrying of it out of Aegypt. Hereupon Attalus invented parchment, called from the place of its invention, Pergamena; from the materials thereof, being sheepe skinnes, Membrana: the conveniencie whereof was the cause, why in short time the Aegyptian paper was worne out; in place whereof succeeded our paper made of ragges: the Author of which invention, our progenitours haue not committed to memorie. Before the vse of these papers and parchment was knowne, I obserue 3 kindes of writing: 1 on the inward side of the barke of a tree, which is in Latine called Liber, and whence we call our bookes Libri. 2ly on tables framed out of the maine body of a tree, which being called Caudex, gaue the Latines occasion to call a booke Codex, 3ly they vsed to couer their Tables ouer with waxe, and thereon to write what they listed, from whence tabellarius now signifieth a letter carrier. The instrument with which they wrote, was a sharpe-pointed iron, which they called Stylus, a word now signifying (the originall hence taken) the peculiar kind of phrase, which any man vseth; as negligens stylus in Quintilian; and exercitatus stylus in Cicero. I should haue told you how they vsed also to write in leaues, and how the Sybils Oracles being thereon written, and scattered abroad, were called Sybillae folia; and from whence perhaps, we still vse to say, a leafe of paper: but of this enough.
               The people of this Country were instructed in the Gospell by Saint Marke, which they generally retained till the comming of the Saracens: at what time most of them embraced Mahumetanisme. The remainder of the Christians, being in a country so populous not aboue 50000, are called Copties; and that either from 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , scindo, because they vse Circumcision: or from Coptas, a town where the most of them reside: or from Aegophti, a name corrupted from Aegypti. They are in a manner all Iacobites, from whom notwithstanding, as from all other Churches, they differ in some things, viz: 1 They conferre all sacred orders, vnder the Priesthood, vpon Infants immediatly after Baptisme; their parents till they come to 16 yeares of age, performing their office for them: secondly they allow marriage

in the second degree of consanguinity, without any dispensation: thirdly, they obserue not the Lords day, nor any other festiuals, but onely in the cities; and fourthly they embrace and 
                     •
                  ead in their Liturgies, a Gospell, written (as they say) by Nicodemus.
               
               In the time of Heathenisme, the Priests were held in equall honour with their kings; who expressed their conceits, both belonging to Religion and worldly affaires, by the shapes of beasts, birds, trees, &c. which they called Hieroglyphickes, of which two or three examples out of Orus will not be impertinent. For aeternity, they painted the Sunne and the Moone, as things which they belieued had no beginning, nor would haue any end. For a yeare, they painted a snake, with his taile in his mouth; to shew how one yeare succeeding another, kept the world still in an endlesse circle. For a moneth, they painted a palme tree; because at euery new Moon it sendeth forth a new branch. For God, they painted a Falcon; as well for that he soareth so high, as that he gouerneth the lesser birds for integrity of life, they painted fire & water, both because these Elements are in themselues most pure, and because all other things are purified by them. For any thing that was abominable to the gods, they painted a fish; because in their sacrifices, the Priests neuer vsed them; and the like. From this manner of expressing ones selfe, the invention of letters is thought to haue had its originall; the history whereof, take briefly, & word for word, out of Tacitus: Primi per formas animalium Aegypti, &c. The Egyptians first of all expressed the conceptions of the minde, by the shapes of beasts; and the most ancient monuments of mans memory, are seene grauen in stones, and they say, that they are the first inventers of letters. Then the Phoenicians, because they were strong at sea, brought them into Greece, and so they had the glory of that, which they receiued from others. For there goeth a report, that Cadmus sayling thither in a Phoenician ship, was the inventer of the art among the Greekes, when they were yet vnexpert and rude. Some record that Cecrops the Athenian, or Livius the Theban, and Palamedes the Grecian, did finde out 16 Characters, at the time of the Troian warre; and

that afterward Simonides added the rest. But in Italy the Etrurians learned them of Demaratus the Corinthian; and the Aberigines of Evand

                     ns were the first inventers of Letters, I dare not affirme; & as backward am I to referre the glory hereof to the Egyptians; for certainly the Iewes were herein skilled before either: yet that the Phoenicians were herein Schoolmasters to the Greekes, I thinke I may with safety affirme, hauing Lucan in consent with Tacitus.

The chiese of the present are 1 Alexandria, built by Alexander the Great, now called Scanderia, a Town of great Marchandize; and which in the Nicene Councell, was ordained to bee one of the foure Patriarchall Cities: the other three being Antioch, Rome, and Constantinople. The inhabitants of this Towne, as they abound in all wealth and pleasure, so in all licentiousnes of life and speech; not sparing their Gouernour, nor the Roman Emperours, Lords Paramount of their Country. Caracalla, sonne to Seuerus, euen when he came to honour their City with his presence, scaped not scot-free. But he of a hasty nature, and impatient of all personall and verball abuse; calling an assemblie of all the youths of the City, as if out of them he would choose some to attend on his person; suddenly commanded his souldiers to put them all to the sword. The slaughter was so great, and the waters of Nilus so discoloured with blood, that now the riuer might not improperly bin called the Red Sea. In this Town, Anno 180, Gautenus read Diuinity & Philosophy; from whom it is thought, that the orders of instituting Vniuersities first began in Christendome. 2 Pelusium, now called Damiata, besieged often by Christian Armies. The most famous of these sieges, was that of Iohn di Brenne, the titu'ary King of Hierusalem, & the confederate Princes of Europe, Anno 1220, This siege continued 18 moneths, during which time, the plague and want of sustenance so raged together, that the Town was in a manner dispeopled. Of these extremities the besiegers knew nothing, till it fortuned that two ventrous soldiers, admiring the silence and solitude of the people, in a bravada scaled the walls, but saw no man to make resistance. This being certified to the Captaines, the next day the whole Army entred the Town, where they found in euery house, and euery corner of the streets, whole heapes of dead bodies, some slaine by famine; others by the pestilence: a lamentable and ruthfull spectacle. 3 Bubastis, where Diana was worshipped. 4 Heliopolis, (now called Betsamis)▪ whereof Potipharah, whose daughter Asineta, was by Pharaoh giuen in marriage to Ioseph, was

On the East side of Egypt is the Red Sea, so called of the colour of the sands: as also Sinus Arabicus. It is in length 1600 miles. It is

                  amous for the miraculous passage of the Israelits through it, & the drowning of Pharaoh Cenchres, & his people; as also for that through it the spices of India & Arabia were brought to Alexandria; and thence by the Venetians dispersed through all Europe, Africa, and Asia. I suppose I shall not doe amisse to set down Historically, a relation of the beginning, continuance, and period of the traffick through this Sea. Ptol. Philadelphus, 277 yeares before the Incarnation, was the first that set a foot this navigation;
                     Galvano.

                        •
                     s) on the Sea side, was the ordinary Hauen, out of which they hoysed 
                     •
                  aile for India; and into which they returned full fraught with their commodities. From hence they were by land conveighed to Coptus, and so downe the Nile to Alexandria: by which trafficke, the City grew exceeding rich; insomuch, that the custome-house there yeelded Ptol. Auletes, 7 millions and a halfe of gold, yearely. The Romans being Lords of Egypt, enhanced the customes to double that summe. They sent into India euery

yeare (as Pliny witnesseth) 120 ships, whose lading was worth 1200000 Crownes; and there was made in returne of euery Crowne, an hundred. When the Vandals, Lombards, Gothes, & Moores, had torne in pieces the Roman Empire, all commerce between Nations began to cease; at last perceiuing the inconvenience, they began anew; conveighing the Indian commodities, partly by land, partly by water, vnto Capha, in Taurica Chersonesus, belonging to the Genoys. Next, Trabezond was made the Mart-Towne; then Sarmachand in Zagetace; where the Indian, Turkish, and Persian merchants, met to barter wares: the Turks conveighing their merchandise to Damascus, Barutti, and Aleppo; from whence the Venetians transported it to Venice, making that the common Emporium of Christendome. Once againe, viz: Anno 1300, the Soldans of Aegypt restored the passage by the Red Sea: which hauing continued more then 200 yeares, is discontinued by the Portugals, Spaniards, English, and Dutch, which bring them to their seuerall homes by the backe side of Africke; so that not only the traffick of Alexandria is almost decayed; the riches of the Venetians much diminished; but the drugs and spices haue lost much of their vertue, as impaired by too much moisture.
               This sea is also called Mare Erythraeum, on whose bankes dwelt that Sybill which was called Erythraea. These Sybillae seem to haue taken denomination from 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , 1. Iovis consiliorum consciae. They were in number ten, viz: 1 Persica: 2 Lybica. 3 Delphica. 4 Cumaea. 5 Samia. 6 Hellespontiaca. 7 Tiburtina. 8 Albunea. 9 this Erythraea. 10 Cumana, which last is affirmed to haue writtē the 9 books of the Sybils. They were al presented by an old Woman to Tarquinius Superbus; but he not willing to pay so great a summe of money as was demanded, denied them: whereupon the old woman burnt three of them, requiring as much money for the other sixe, as for all; which being denied, she also burned the other three, asking as much for the three remaining, as for the rest: which Superbus, amazed, gaue, and the old trot vanished. These bookes contained manifest prophesies of the kingdome of Christ, his name, his birth, and death; these were burned by the arch-traitour Stilico: So

that those prophesies which are now extant, are onely such as are extracted out of others writings, wherein mention of them was made.
               All along the shores of this Sea, as also in the most desart places of the country, are abundance of palmes; trees of very strange properties. They growe in couples male and female, both thrust forth cods full of seed; but the female is only fruitfull, and that not except growing by the male, and hauing his seeds mixed with hers. The pith of these trees, is an excellent sallad, better then an hartichoke, which in tast it much resembleth. Of the branches they make bedsteeds, lattices, &c. Of the leaues, baskets, mats, fannes, &c. Of the outward huske of the Codde, cordage; of the inward brushes. The fruit it beareth is like a figge, and finally it is said to yeeld whatsoeuer is necessary to the life of man. It is the nature of this tree, though neuer so huge or ponderous a waight were put vpon it, neuer to yeeld to the burden; but still on resist the heauinesse thereof, and to indeauour to lift and raise it selfe the more vpward: for which cause it was giuen to conquerours in token of victory, it being the embleme or hierogliphicke of a souldiers life, and perseuerance. Hence figuratiuely it is vsed, sometimes for precedency, as huic equidem consilio palmam do, in Terence, sometime for the victory it selfe, as non auferent tamen hanc palmam, in Plinie; & plurimarum palmarum homo, for a man that had wonne many prizes in the fence▪ schoole, in Cicero pro Roscio: but for the signe of victory more naturally, as in that of Horace,

               Sithence that Cyrene, and the Ile Pharos, are reckoned as part of Egypt; we will describe them here, as members of the same body.
               CYRENE hath on the East Egipt; on the West, the kingdome of Tunis; on the North, the Mediterranean; and on the South the hill Atlas. The most ancient name hath beene Pontapolitana, from the fiue Citties, Cyrene, Ptolomais, Arsinoe, Apollonia,
                  
and Berenice. The soyle is barren both of fruits, & waters, the people rude, and liuing by theft: yet hath it giuen ayre to the ingenious spirits, of Aristippus the Philosopher, Callimachus the Poet, Eratosthenes the Mathematician, and Simon of Cyrene, whom the Iewes compelled to carry our Sauiours Crosse.
               In the borders of this Country toward Barbary, stood the famous altars, called Arae Philenorum, erected on this occasion. There had beene many iarres and discontents, betweene the citizens of Carthage and Cyrene, for their bounds. At last it was agreed, that at a set time, two men should bee sent out of each Towne, toward the other; and where they met, there should be erected a boundary of their seuerall dominions. These Phil

The young men preferring common good before priuate safetie, accepted the first; were murdered: and the Carthaginians in their honours founded these altars.
               In this Country stood the Oracle of Iupiter Hammon, whither when Alexander trauelled, hee saw for foure daies space, neither Man, Beast, Bird, Tree, nor Riuer: this Temple lying on the more Southerne part of the Country, which is sicke of the same disease with Numidia, and Lybia. For this Country is all ouer couered with a light sand, which the windes remooue continually vp and downe, turning valleyes into hills, and hills into valleies.

               Of these fiue Latti, two only are of fame, viz: Amenophis, of whom we haue already related a pretty story: and Vexores, or Sesostris, who being a Prince of great wealth and puissance, had brought in subiection all his neighbouring kings; whom hee compelled in turnes to drawe his Chariot. It hapned that one of these vnfortunate Princes, cast his eye many times on the coach wheeles; and being by Sesostris demanded the cause of his so doing, he replied: that the falling of that spoke lowest, which but

                  ust before was in the height of the wheele, put him in minde of the instabilitie of fortune. The king deeply waighing the parable, would neuer afterward be so drawne in his Chariot. He also was the first that encountred the Scythians in battle; for hauing already in conceit conquered them, he led his army against them. The Scythians maruelled that a king of so great reuenewes would wage warre against a nation so poore, with whom the fight would be doubtfull, the victory vnprofitable, but to be vanquished a perpetuall infamie and disgrace. For their par

                  7 Nectanebos, II. In the 18 yeare of the reign of this King, Egypt was againe recouered by the valour of Ochus, the eight Emperour of Persia. And when Alexander had ouerthrowne Darius, he came, and without blowes wonne this fertile kingdome, which yeelded him, during his life, the yearely value of 6000 talents. After his death, this kingdome fell to the share of Ptolomeus the sonne of Lagi, from whom all the subsequent Kings of Egypt were called Ptolomies.

These Ptolomean Princes of Egypt, were for the most part in warres with the kings of Syria, in which they were by turnes victorious, and vanquished: neither Prince hauing cause to boast of his bargaine. After the death of Cleopatra, whose life and loue with Marcus Antonius, I will not now relate; this Country fell to the share of the Roman Emperours, and was by them highly prized, & warily looked into. The Gouernour hereof, was at the best but a Gentleman of Rome; no Senator being permitted to come into it: it being a maxime of state, not to suffer men of great houses, to come into that country, whose reuolt may indanger the whole Empire. Of this nature was Egypt, for besides the naturall situation of the place very defensible; and besides the abundance of money with which it was stored▪ this Country alone

But by the leaue of so worthy a man, this cannot hold good: or the Mamalucks, as we shall anon see, succeeded not the Caliphs in the gouernment of Egypt; but the Turkish kings. As for the names recited, I suppose them only to be the names of the Turkish kings, corrupted, or altered, according to the diuersity of language; for who seeth not Sarracon to bee meant by Assareddin, Salad

                  5 Melechsela a worthy Prince, who ouercame S. Lewis the ninth, king of France; and going with him towards Damiata, was villanously slaine by his Souldiers, called Mamaluckes.
                  
               
               These Mamaluckes were the of-spring of Georgia, and Colchis, vulgarly called the Circassi: whom this Melechs
                        •
                     la bought either of their parents, or of the Tartars, then newly possessed of these Countries, to supply the defect of the effeminate Egyptians. These slaues now knowing their own abilities, slew their Lord and Master Melechsela; and appointed one Turquimeneius, a man of great spirit and valour, for their king; and loath to re-giue the supreame authority into the hands of the Egyptians, nor permitting their sonnes the name and prerogatiue of Mamaluckes; they yeare by yeare chose some of their owne Country, whom they gaue to diuers countrymen to learne the languages and religion of Mahomet. This being effected, they allotted them to higher preferment, vsing such discipline with them, as the Turkes doe now with their Ianizaries: who perchance may make as great a mutation in the Turkish Empire, as the Mamaluck
                        •
                     s did in the Egyptian. So vnsafe it is for a Prince to commit the tuition of his person, or the defence of his Realm to such; whom hope of profit, and not naturall allegiance maketh faithfull. Our Constance was murdered by his Guard of Picts. Most of the Roman Emperours by such Souldiers, whom hope of prey, not free seruice to the Prince, drew into the field. And I thinke no man is ignorant how often principalities, especially those of Italy, haue beene indangered by mercenary Martialists. Francisco Sforza fought vnder the banners of the

                  Millanoys, and on hope of more allowance reuolted to the Florentines, the enimies of that Dutchie. Guiacopo Picinino with his dependants, followed the ensignes of Ferdinand of Naples; left him to fight for his vowed enimy, Iohn of Aniou; whom also he forsooke in his greatest need. I will not specifie, yet I will not exempt the Switzers, and their dealing in this kind towards the French: so that I may apply that which the Gospell speakes of the hireling Ministers, to the hireling Souldier, They will flie when the enimie commeth, and not lay downe their life for their flocke. Now as it is vnsafe for a Prince to commit the guard of his person to the faith of forrainers: so also is it dangerous for him, in the defence of his Realme or State, to rely on their fidelitie. A moderate supply of men, mony, or munition, from a confederate King, is, I confesse, in most cases conuenient, in some necessary: as well to saue the natiues from the sword; as to trie a friend, and interest an allie in the same cause. But to inuite so great a number of succours, as from helpers may become Masters, and oppresse the people whom they came to defend: is that rocke on which many Realmes haue suffered shipwracke; and which a good Pilot of the state, should with all care avoid. For as in the sicknesse of the body natural, it is hurtfull to a mans health and life, to take more physick then it may (after the effect thereof be wrought) either digest, or put out againe: so in the body politick, it is a perillous matter to receaue more succours, then what (after they haue done the deed they were sent for) we may either with conueniency reward and settle with vs; or at liberty expell. Of all surfets, this of forraigne supplies is most vncurable; and Ne quid nimis, if in nothing else true, is in this case, oracle. There is no kingdome (I am verily perswaded) vnder the Sun, which hath not beene by this means conquered; no Commonwealth, which hath not beene by this meanes ruined. To relate all examples, were infinite and tedious: to inferre some, pleasing to the reader; and to illustrate the point, not vnnecessary. To beginne with former times. Philip of Maced
                        •
                     n, called into Greece, to assist the Thebans against the Phocians, brought all that Countrey vnder his command. The Romans by ayding the Sicilians against the Carthaginians,
                  
possessed themselues of that flourishing Iland: by assisting the Hodui, against the Sequani, mastred France: by succouring Androgeus, against Cassibelan, seazed on Brittaine: by siding with the Aetolians, against Perseus, vnited to their Empire, all the Empire of Macedon; and by the same course what not? In after ages, the Brittaines called in the Saxons, & were by them thrust out of all: the Irish called in the English, by whom they were in processe of time totally subdued: and the Indians called in the Mongull Tartars, who now Lord it ouer them. These forraine supplies are inuited or let into a Country, commonly in three cases. First, when some one man vpon discontent, or desi

And 3ly when a king ouerburdened by a forraine

                        ••
                     dico est quàm à morbo mali: so the Neapolitans being ouerlaid by the French, implored the ayd of the Spaniards: & so the last Caliph of this Egypt, where we now are, being ouercharged by Almericus king of Hierusalem, receaued succours from the Turkes: by which meanes both these kingdomes became a prey to their friends, & auoiding Scylla, fel into Charybdis. Nay somtimes it so hapneth, that these forraine succours ioyne with those whom they came to expell, and hauing vanquished the natiues, diuided the Country betweene them: and so we finde the Burgundians, being by Stilico called into Gallia to expel the Franks then newly entred; to haue ioyned forces with these Franks, and neuer to haue parted, till they had in a manner cast the deceaued Romans quite out of Gaule. Only among so many histories, we find the Low-countrymen to haue thriued by these courses, who by the assistance of forraine friends cleered themselues

from the fangs of Spaine: which obiection I confesse to be true, and for the honour and integrity of the English nation, am aboue measure glad of it; who saw no further then the defence of their neighbours, and aimed at no other end then the vertue it selfe.. But giue me the like instance and I will quit my cause; for the same Low-countreymen, found the French & German Souldiers, vnder the Prince of Orange, to bee but turne-tailes; and as for Francis Duke of Alanson, whom they had made Duke of Brabant, and their gouernour generall: his chief plot was to make himselfe an absolute tyrant ouer them. So that I thinke I may safely conclude, that forraine succours are of all remedies, the least to be trusted, and the last to be tried: but it is now more then time that I returned vnto the Mamaluckes.

               1 MAGADASCAR, called also the Iland of S. Laurence, aboundeth with all manner of fruits; as also Beasts wild & tame. The inhabitants are of a duskie colour, curled haire, and Idolaters. The chiefe Towne is Magadascar. This Iland is in length 1200, in compasse 4000 miles; and situate vnder the Southern Tropique. It was discouered by the Portugalls, Ao 1506; The people are trecherous and vnhospitable; they vsed not to trade with others, neither suffered they others to trade with them: & though the Portugalls haue obtained a little trafficke with them, yet are they not permitted to come on land. The soyle yeeldeth cloues, Ginger, and Siluer; it is enriched with safe harbours, faire riuers, and plentie of fruit, and cattle: a Countrey too good for so base a people. For besides their two good qualities aboue-mentioned, they are ignorant of prayer, and festivals:

they haue no distinction of months or yeares, neither haue they any proper names for the daies of the weeke. The onely thing laudable in thē is the restraining themselues to one wife.
               2 ZOCOTARA lieth iust at the mouth of the Red Sea, and is some 10 degrees North from the Aequator; being in length 60, in breadth 24 miles.

The chiefe Citty is Zocotara, the place of the kings residence: whose subiects are of tall stature, ash

The Iland though deficient in necessaries to life, is yet well replenished with Apothecaries drugges, and in especiall it yeeldeth the Aloe Zocatrina, Nigh hereunto are two Ilands, the one inhabited by men only, the other only by women, who at certaine times doe meet but stay not long together: the ayre of the one (as it is reported) not being healthie to the others inhabitants.
               3 St THOMAS is in compasse 180 miles: It is of a round figure, and lieth directly vnder the Equinoctiall line. It is so fruitfull of sugar, that 40 shippes are loden with it euery yeare: The prime Citty is Pavoasan. When it was first discouered, it was nothing but a wood; but is now inhabited by Portugalls, and Negroes: the Negroes attaining diuerse times to 100 yeares of age; the Portugalls neuer exceeding 50. Wheat here sowne never commeth to any good; neither will it beare any fruit that hath a stone in it.
               4 The Ile Del Principe, or the PRINCES ILAND, is situate betweene the Aequator, & the Tropicke of Capricorne; nigh vnto it is the Ile of Helens: they are both vnder the command of the Spaniard. The last took name from the Saints day where on it was discouered; and the first, because when the Portugalls had conquerd it, the reuenues hereof were allotted to the Portugall Prince.
               5 The GORGADES, anciently called the Gorgons, where Medusa, and her two sister dwelt. This Medusa is said by the Poets, to haue beene a woman of great beauty; who either for

The Historians (for as some think omnis fabula fundatur in historia) relate, how this Medusa was indeed a Lady of such exceeding beauty, that all men that saw her were amazed; and of such wise and subtile brain, that for that cause only men attributed vnto her a Serpents head: She abounding in wealth, and by piracie molesting the Seas of Europe, was inuaded by an army of Grecians, vnder the leading of Perseus, who in a single combat slew her. Perseus when he plucked off her helmet, admiring that beauty which he had destroy

               7 THE AZORES are in number 9, viz: 1 S. Marie; 2 S. Michael, 3 Gratiosa, 4. S. George, 5 Pico, 6 Faiall, 7 Flores, 8 Corvo, 9 Tercera, which being the principall, giueth now name to all the rest, being called at this day the Tercera's. They were first discouered by the Flemings, and called the Flemish Ilands. Tercera it selfe aboundeth in Oade, called by vs Iland Oade: It is in compasse 18 miles, and was the last place that held out for Don Antonio against the Castilians. The second Iland of note is S. Michaell, famous in that our moderne Geographers, haue from the Canaries, or Fortunate Ilands (where the ancient Geographers placed it) remooued hereunto the first Meridian, whose office is to d

All these Ilands were subdued by the Portugalls, vnder the conduct of Prince Henry, (sonne to Alphonso the fift, and father to Iohn the second) who first made the Portugals in love with the seas, Anno 1444.

For here dwelt the daughters of Atlas; here grew the golden apples kept by a dragon, and taken hence by Hercules; and here was the abode of blessed creatures, said to be called the Elysian fields. Of any Writer in my conceit, Plutarch best describeth them, and out of him I afford it vnto you;

They haue raine there very seldome, but a fine sweet dew, which maketh the earth very fertile, with litle or no paines to the husbandman. The weather is continually faire, the seasons all temperate, and the Aire neuer extreme.

            OF AMERICA.
            THis great tract of Land is most aptly called the NEW WORLD. New, for the late discouery; and World, for the vast spaciousnesse of it.

                The most vsuall, and yet somwhat improper name, is AMERICA, because Americus Vespuccius discouered it: but sithence Columbus gaue vs the first light to discerne these Countries, both by example and directions; and Sebastianus Cabot touched at many parts of the Continent which Americus neuer saw: why is it not aswell called Columbana, Sebastiana, or Cabotia? The most improper name of all, yet most vsual among Marriners, is the WESTERNE INDIES: Westerne, because of the West situation; and India, because by that one name they expresse all wealthie (if remote) countries.
            Many are of an opinion, and that rather grounded on coniecturall probabilities, then demonstratiue arguments; that this America was knowne long before our late discoueries. Their first reason is drawne from the doctrine of the Antipodes, which being among the ancient Philosophers, cannot but inferre a knowledge of these parts: to which we answere, that there was indeed a knowledge of the Antipodes by demōstratiō only; but not in fact: or if you will, we will say that it was known there were Antipodes; but the Antipodes were not knowne. Secondly, they say that Hanno a Carthaginian Captaine, discouered a great Iland: but he (saith Mela) sailed not Westward, but Southward, and lighted on a great Iland, which whatsoeuer it was (perhaps Magadascar) sure I am it was not America, and returned home, wanting not (as he told the Senate) Sea-room,

but victuals. Thirdly they produce these verses of Seneca, to inferre a knowledge of this great Country.

He considering the motion of the Sunne, could not perswade himselfe, but that there was another world, to which the Sunne imparted his light, after his departure from our Horizon. This world he hoped to discouer, and opening his intent to the Genowaies, Anno 1486, was by them reiected. Hereupon he sent his brother Bartholomew Columbus, to motion the matter to Henry the 7th, then King of England: but he vnfortunatly hapned into the hands of Pirats, who after long imprisonmēt, enlarged him Assoone as he was at liberty, he came to the English Court, & sollicited his brothers cause: the King ioyfully entertained the action, and sent for Christopher Columbus to come vnto him. But God had otherwise disposed of this rich purchase; for Columbus not knowing of his brothers imprisonment, nor hearing any thing of his hoped successe: thought his proffer to haue bin neglected or contemned; and thereupon he made his desires knowne at the Court of Castile; where after many delayes, he was furnished with two ships only; & those not for the conquest, but discouery. With this small assistance, he sailed in the maine Ocean, more then 60 dayes, yet could not as yet descry any land; so that the discontented Spaniards began a mutiny, & desirous to returne, would not goe a foot forward. At last the wary Italian, seeing the cloudes carry a clearer colour, then hitherto they had done; & thinking that this

clearenesse proceeded from some nigh habitable places; restrained the time of their expectation within the compasse of three dayes: in that space, if no land offred it selfe to their view, ingaging himselfe to returne. At the end of these three dayes, one of the company descried fire, an euident argument of the adiacent Country: which presently after, they apparantly discerned, Anno 1492. This Region was an Iland, by the inhabitants called Hailie; but by Columbus in honour of the Spaniards, Hispaniola Afterward he discouered Cuba, and with much treasure & greater content, he returned to Spain-ward: & after two great navigations (besides this) finished, he died, and lyeth buried at Seuill. The Spaniards notwithstanding the good seruice of this man, did not sticke after his death onely, to depriue him of the honour of these discoueries, attributing it to I know not what Spaniard, whose Cardes & descriptions this Columbus had met withall: but in his life also they would often say, that it was a matter of no such difficulty to haue found out these Countries; and that if hee had not done it, some-bodie else might.
            At the first arriuall of the Spaniards into this Country, they found the people without all manner of apparell, nought skilled in Agriculture, making their bread of a kind of root, called Maiz, a root wherein is a venomous liquor, not inferiour to most deadly poysons; but this iuyce they crush out, and after hauing dryed and prepared the root, make their bread of it. They worshipped diuelish spirits, whom they called Zemes; in remembrance of whom they kept continually certaine images as it were, made of cotton wooll, like to our childrens babies. To these they did doe great reuerence, as supposing the spirit of their Zemes to be in them: & the diuel to blind them the more, would make th

They stood also in great feare of them; for if their wills were not fulfilled, the diuell straight executed vengeance on some of the children of this blinded & infatuated people. They thought the Christians to be immortall, wondring at the masts, sailes, and tacklings of their ships, (themselues knowing no ships, but 
                  •
               uge troughs made of some great-bodied trees) but this opinion

of the Christians immortality continued not long; for hauing taken some of them, they held their heads vnder the water till they were choaked; by which they knew them to bee mortall. They were quite destitute of all good learning, reckoning their times by a confused obseruation of the Moone; and strangely admiring to see one Spaniard know the health and affaires of another, by a letter only. They were of a simple honest nature, without fraude, giuing entertainment after their kind, and grossely conceiued the immortality of the soule, supposing that beyond certain hills, they knew not where, those that died in defence of their country, should inioy eternall happinesse. They esteemed of Gold and Siluer, as of drosse, with which notwithstanding for the colour sake they adorned themselues, as also with Shells, Feathers, and the like, &c.
            The inhabitants (though a great part of this Country lieth in the same parallell with Ethiopia, Lybia, and Numidia) are of a reasonable faire complexion, and very litle (if at all) inclining to blacknesse. So that the extraordinary & continuall vicinity of the Sunne, is not (as some imagine) the operatiue cause of blacknesse: though it may much further such a colour; as wee see in our Country lasses, whose faces alwayes are exposed to winde & weather. Others, more wise in their owne conceit, though this conceit know no confederate, plainly conclude the generatiue seed of the Africans to be blacke; but of the Americans to be white: a foolish supposition, and convinced not only out of experience, but naturall Philosophie. As for that foolish tale of Cham's knowing his wife in the Arke, whereupon by diuine curse his sonne Chus with all his posterity, (which they say are the Africans) were all blacke: it is so vaine, that I will not endeauour to refell it.

            They are without question the progenie of the Tartars, which may bee proued by many arguments, some negatiue, some also affirmatiue. The negatiue arguments are, 1 they haue no relish nor resemblance at all, of the Arts, Learning, and ciuility of Europe. Secondly, their colour sheweth them not to haue descended from the Africans, here being no blacke men

in all this Country, but some few which inhabite the sea-coasts ouer against Guinea in Africke: from whence they are supposed by some tempest to haue bin brought hither. Thirdly, they haue not the least token or shew, of the Arts or industry of China, India, or any ciuill Region on that side of Asia. The affirmatiue arguments proue first, that they came from Asia; next in particular from Tartarie. That they came out of Asia, is more then manifest, in that the west side of the Country towards Asia, is farre more populous then the East towards Europe: of which there can be no other reason assigned, then that these parts were first inhabited; and that from hence the rest was peopled. Next for the next, the idolatry of this people, and the particularities thereof; their inciuility and barbarous properties, tell vs that they are most like the Tartars, of any. Secondly the west side of America, if it be nor Continent with Tartary, is yet disioyned by a very small straight, as may be perceiued in all our mappes, and Cardes; as also in the descriptions of these Countries: So that there is into these Countries, a very quicke & easie passage. And thirdly the people of Quivira, which of all the Prouinces of America is the nearest vnto Tartary, are saide to follow in the whole course of their life, the seasons & best pasturing of their oxen; iust like the Scythian Nomades, or Tartarian hords: an euident argument of their descent and originall.

When she was dead, Fernando licenced generally all the Spaniards, excluding onely the Portugals. But so rich a prize could not so warily be fenced, but that Portugals, French, English, and now of late the Low-countrimen, haue layed in their owne barnes, part of the Spaniards haruest, who well hoped to haue had a monopolie o

For proofe of which, I will draw down a small History of Navigation, from its infancie, till this perfect & complete growth. In the worlds beginning, men quietly liued at home, neither greedy of forrain commodities, nor inquisitiue after their liues or fortunes; and as the Poët hath it

But when the prouidence of God had instructed Noah how to build an Arke, for the safety of him and his, from the vniuersall Deluge; this Arke setling on the mountaines of Ararat, & there long time remaining; gaue the Phoenicians, a sea-people, a patterne, whereby they might make the waters passable. The heathen writers which knew not Noah, attribute the invention of

shipping to diuerse men: Strabo, to Minos King of Crete; Diodorus Siculus, to Neptune; who was therefore called the god of the Sea: and Tibullus, to the City of Tyre, a most potent and flourishing Common

The Aegyptians receiued this invention from the Tyrians, and added much vnto it. For whereas first the vessels were either made of an hollow tree, of sundry bordes ioyned together, and couered with beasts skinnes, which kinde of vessels are still in vse in America: the Phoenicians brought them to strength & forme; but the Aegyptians added deckes vnto them. This vse of shipping was taught the Greekes, by Danaus King of Egypt, when he fled from his brother Rameses, Nave prunus ab Aegypto Danaus advenit (saith Pliny) ante enim ratibus navigabatur: where we may see the difference betweene navis, a ship; & ratis, a barge, or open vessell; of which last sort were they, which waf

Of all the Grecians, the Cretans were this way most industrious, which gaue both occasion to Aristotle to call Crete the Lady of the Sea; and to the Prouerbe, Cretensis nescit pelagus? The Carthaginians being a Colonie of Tyre, were perfect in this Art, and thereby much damaged the Romans: till it hapned that a tempest, separating a Quinqueremis, or Galley of fiue oares, from the Carthaginian Fleet, cast it on the shoare; of Italy, whereby the Romans learning the Art of ship-wrights, quickly became masters of the Sea. This chanced about the beginning of the first Punicke warre. That France, and Spaine, learned this Art from the Phoenicians, is more then probable: Marseiles in the one, and Cadiz in the other, being both Tyrian Colonies. As for the Belgians, till the Romans taught it, there was no shipping, Caesar himselfe affirming, that Ad eos mercatores minimè cōmeant. And the seas twixt Brittaine, and France, were so ill furnished with vessels, that Caesars souldiers were compelled to make shippes, for the transportation of his Army; singulari militum studio, (they are his owne words) circiter sexcentas & d

The Phoenicians (as we haue before said) invented open vessels; the Aegyptians, shippes with deckes; they also invented the Galley of two bankes on a side, which vessels by length of time grew so large, that Ptolomie Philopater made one, of no fewer then 50 bankes of oares on one side, Large ships of burden called Circera, we owe to the Cypriots; cockboats, or ski

As for the tacklings, the Boeotians invented the oare; Daedalus, and his sonne Icarus, the masts & sailes; which gaue the Poëts occasion to faigne, that those two made wings to their bodies, and fled out of Crete; & that Icarus soaring too high, melted his wings, and was drowned: the trueth indeed being, that presuming too farre on his new invention▪ he ranne against a rocke, and so perished: For hippagines, ferrieboats, or vessels for the transporting of horse, we are indebted to the Salaminians; for grappling-hookes to Anach

The greatest voyages which I haue met withall in old stories, are those of Iason, Vlysses, and Alexander, with the Fleetes of Solomon, and the Aegyptian Kings. Of these, Iason and his companions, sailed in the ship Argo, (whereof Typhis aboue-mentioned was master) through the Euxine sea, and part of the Mediterranean: Vlysses through the Mediterranean only, smal gullets if compared with the Ocean. Alexander's iourney so famoused, and accounted so hazardous, was but sayling down the riuer Ganges, and 400 furlongs into the Ocean: and for the Fleets of Solomon, and the Kings of Aegypt, it is very apparant that they went with great leisure, and crawled close by the shore side; otherwise it had bin impossible to haue consumed 3 whole yeares, in going from Ezion Geber, into India, and returning

againe, which was the vsuall time of these voyages, as appeareth in the 1 of Kings, chap. 10, verse 22. After the fall of the Roman Monarchie, the most potent states by sea in the Mediterranean, were the Genowaies, and Venetians: in the Oce

By meanes of this excellent instrument, and withall by the good successe of Columbus: the Portugals, Eastward; the Spaniards, Westward; and the English, Northwards; haue made many a glorious and fortunate expedition. And now I returne to my particular descriptions of America; onely telling you by the way, that the chiefe writers in Pilotisme, or the Art of Navigation, are Petrus de Medina; Peter Nonius in his Regulae artis navigandi; and Iohannes Aurigarius in his Speculum Nauticum.

The chiefe City is Tlascalan, the chiefe city of all these parts next vnto Mexico, vnto whom only it yeeldeth precedencie. It is seated in the pleasantest part of all the country; rich it is, populous, and gouerned after the forme of a Common-wealth, vnder the protection of the King of Spaine. 2 Villeriche, a port-towne, very wealthie, because all the traffick, betwixt the olde and new Spaines, doth passe through it. The Spaniards haue in it two Colonies, viz: Pamico, and S. Iames in the valleyes.
                  
                  4 Tremistatan or Mexico, is the greatest and noblest of these foure: in it are the cities 1 Villarucca, 2 Antichero, 3 Meccioca, 4 O
                           •
                        topan, 5 Mexico, the seat of an Archbishop, and of the Spanish Vice-Roy; whose power is to make Lawes and Ordinances, to giue directions, and determine controuersies, vnlesse it be in such great causes, which are thought fit to be referred 
                        •
                     0 the Councell of Spaine. This City is situate on the Lakes & Ilands like Venice, euery-where interlaced with the pleasant currents of fresh, and sea waters; and carrying a face of more ciuill gouernment then any of America; though nothing, if compared with Europe. The plaine wherein the Town standeth, is said to be 70 leagues in compasse, environed with high hills, on the tops of which, snow lieth continually. The Lake on whose banke it standeth, is 50 miles in compasse; all along whose bankes stand pleasant Townes, and diuerse houses; on which Lake also, 50000 wherries are continually plying. Mexico is in compasse 6 miles, and containeth 6000 houses of Spaniards,
                     
and 60000 of Indians. It is a by-word, that at Mexico there are foure faire things, viz: the women, the apparell, the horse
                        •
                     , and the streets. Here is also a printing house, an Vniuersity, and a Mint.
               
               Nigh to this Citty is the gulfe of Mexico, whose current is so swift and heady, that shipps cannot passe directly to and fro, but are compell'd to beare either much North, or much South. It is 900 miles in compasse; and hath two ports, one betweene the farthest part of Iucutan, and the Ile of Cuba, at which the tide with a violent streame entreth: the other between the said Cuba, and the farthest point of Florida, at which the tide with like violence goeth forth. The Sea is very tempestuous, & hath only two safe portes, viz: Havana on the North side: and 2 St 
                  Iohn de Lua, strongly fortified by the Spaniards, on the South.
               The people of Mexico, or Tremistitan, are witty and industrious, full of courage and valour; good handicraftsmen if they giue their mindes to it, and rich marchants, such as so apply themselues. In their warres they vsed slings and arrowes: and since the comming of the Spaniards among them, the harcubuise. Their kings succeeded not by right of bloud, but by election; and were commonly actiue, lusty, and fit for war; the people holding it lawfull to kill their kings, if they were reputed cowards. They had among them an order of Knights instituted by the last king, which were licensed to weare gold and siluer, to be cloathed in Cotton, & to weare breeches; all which were prohibited the vulgar.
               This Country is inferiour to Peru in the plenty and puritie of gold and siluer, but farre exceeding it both in the mechanical and ingenious arts here professed; & in the abundance of fruits and cattle: of which last here is such store, that many a priuate man hath 40000 kine and oxen to himselfe. Fish is here also in great plenty, that only which is drawne out of the lake whereon Mexico standeth, being reputed worth 20000 Crownes.
               The Mexicans first were the inhabitants of Nova Gallicia, whence they made a violent irruption, as is coniectured, Anno 720. They lingred in diuers places, till the yeare 902, when vnder the leading of Mexi their Captaine, they built this Citty,

and called it after the name of their Generall. They were in all, 7 Tribes; which ruled long in an Aristocraticall state, till the most puissant of the Tribes called Nauatalcas, elected a king to whom they submitted themselues.

               The most fortunate of these Kings was Izchoalt, who by his Cosen Tlacaellec, subdued the other 6 Tribes, & brought them vnder the Mexican Kings. After the death of Izchoalt, Tlacaellec was by the Electours (which are six in number) chosen K. as a man of whose vertue they had formerly made triall. But he very nobly refused it, saying, that it was more conuenient for the commonwealth, that another should be king, and that hee should execute that which was for the necessity of the state, thē to lay the whole burden vpon his backe: and that without being king, he would not leaue to labour for the publike, as well as if he were. Vpon this generous refusall, they made choice of Motecumo the first. The most vnhappy, at whose birth could not but be some disastrous aspect of the Planets, were the two last: who were both vanquished by Fernando Cortez & Mexico was made subiect to Spaine, Anno. 1521. The army which Cortez led with him, to conquer this so puissant and florishing estate, consisted of 100000 Indians, or Americans, 900 Spaniards only, 80 horse, 17 peeces of small ordnance, 13 brig
                     •
                  ndines, and 6000 wherry-boats, which he imploied in infesting Mexico from the lake aboue mentioned. Most of these 100000 Indians were of the Citty and territory of Tlascalan, who never held good side with the Mexicans: for which cause that citty enioyeth many immunities to this day.
               QVIVIRA is seated on the most Westerne part of America, iust ouer against Tartary, from whence being not much distant, it is supposed that the inhabitants first came into this new world. It is full of herbage, and enioyeth a temperat ayre:

the people are desirous of Glasse more then of Gold; & in some places are Caniballs. The chiefe riches of this Country, are their kine, which are to this people, as wee say with vs of our Ale to drunkards; meat, drinke, and cloath, and more too. For their hides yeeld them houses, or at least the couerings of them; their bone, bodkinnes; their haire, threed; their sinewes, ropes; their hornes, mawes, and bladders, vessells; their dung, fire; their Calues-skinnes, budgets to draw and keepe water; their bloud drinke; their flesh, meat. There is thought to be some trafficke from China or Cathay hither: For when Vasques di Coronado conquered it, he saw in the further sea certaine shippes, not of common making, which seemed to be well laden; and bare in their prowes, Pellicans: which could not be cōiectured to come from any Country, but one of these two. Hauing now said thus much concerning Quiuira in generall, it is time we should proceed to her Prouinces, which are Cibola, and Noua Albion.
               
               
                  Cibola, lieth on the East side, and taketh its name from the chiefe Citty: the next to which is Totontoa, situate on a riuer so called. 3 Tinguez burnt by the Spaniard, who vnder the conduct of Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, made this Prouince subiect to their King, Anno 1540.
               
                  Noua Albion lieth on the West side, towards Tartary. It was discouered by that Noble Captaine, Sr 
                  Francis Drake, A. 1585 and by him called Noua Albion: because the King did willingly submit himselfe to our Queene. The Country is abundant in fruit, pleasing both the eye and the pallat; the people are giuen to hospitality, but withall to witchcraft, & adoration of diuels. The chiefe Citty is called after the name of the Prouince. Here is a Hare resembling a Want in his feet, & a Cat in his taile; vnder whose chinne nature hath fastned a little bagge, which she hath also taught him to vse as a storehouse; for in this, hauing filled his belly, preserueth the remnant of his prouision. The bound betweene this Quivira, and Mexicana
                        •
                     , is Mar Vermiglio, or Califormio.
               
               NICARAGVA is Southeast from Mexico, with whom it agreeth in nature, both of soyle, and inhabitants. For the people are of good stature, and of colour indifferent white. They

had before they receaued Christianity, a setled & politike form of gouernment: only as Solon appointed no law for a mans killing of his father, so had this people none for the killer of a king both of them conceiting, that men were not so vnnaturall as to commit such crimes. A theefe they iudged not to death, but adiudged him to be slaue to that man whom he had robbed, till by his seruice he had made satisfaction: a course more merciful, and not lesse iust, then the losse of life. The Country is so pleasing to the eye, and abounding in all things necessary, that the Spaniards call it Mahomets paradise; and among other flourishing trees, here groweth one of that nature, that a man cannot touch any of their branches, but it withereth presently. It is as plentifull of Parrets, as England is of Crowes; and hath a lake 300 miles in compasse, which hauing no entercourse with the Ocean, doth yet ebbe and flowe continually. The chiefe Citties are 1 New Granado. 2 Leo a Bishops See.
               IVCVTAN, was first manifested to the Europaeans, by Francisco Hernandes di Cordoua, Anno 1517. It was called Iucutan not as some conceit it, from Ioctan the son of Heber, who they thinke came out of the East, where the Scripture placeth him, (Gen. 10.30) to inhabit here: but from Iucutan, which in the American tongue, is, what say you. For when the Spaniards at their first comming hither, asked the name of the place; the Savages not vnderstanding what they meant, replied Iucutan, that is, what say you: wherevpon the Spaniards alwaies after called it by this name. The Country is 900 miles in circuit, and is a Peninsula. This Country is very fresh and plentifull, but especially about Guatimala. It is situate ouer against the Ile Cuba, & is diuided into three parts: I, Iucutan, whose Citties of greatest worth, are Campechium, Sidalancum; and one, which for its greatnesse and beauty, they call Caire. II, Guatimala, whose inhabitants haue lost halfe a million of their kinsmen and friends, by the vnmercifull dealing of the Spaniards: The chiefe Townes are Guatimala, Cassuca, and Giapa. III, Acasamill, an Iland ouer against Guatimala, vulgarly called Santa Cruza, or Insula S. Crncis. The chiefe towne is Santa Cruza.
               
               FLORIDA hath on the East Mare del Norte; on the West,

                  Mexico; on the North, Noua Francia; & on the south, Virginia. It was discouered by the English, vnder the guiding of Sebastian Cabot, Anno 1497. Afterward it was possessed by Iohn Ponce, a Spaniard, 1527; who called it Florida, because hee came first to it on Easter day, which the Spaniards call Pascha Florida; or else quia Florida erat regio, because it was a flourishing Country. For indeed the Country aboundeth with goodly fruits, & hath good quantity of gold and siluer: Emeralds are also found here, and so are Turquosies and Pearles. The men of this country doe naturally loue warre and reuenge, insomuch that they are continually in warre with one or other. They are crafty also and very intelligent, as appeareth by the answere they gaue to Ferdinando Soto, a Spaniard, who was here among them Ao 1549. For when he went to perswade the people that hee was the sonne of God, and came to teach them the law: not so, replied a Floridan, for God neuer bad thee to kill and slaie thus, and worke all kinde of mischief amongst vs. The women when their husbands are dead, vse to cut off their haire close to their eares, and strew it on his sepulchre: and cannot marry againe, till their haire be grown long enough to couer their shoulders. Hermaphrodites are here also in great plenty, whom they vse as beasts to carry their luggage, and put them to all kinde of drudgery. They haue all a grosse beleefe of the soules immortality, but are otherwise idolaters. After the discouery of Ponce, this Country fell next into the possession of Iohn Ribaulte and the French, Anno 1562: but the Spaniards vnwilling to let the French be eye-witnesses of their rich booty, waged warre with them so long; that there was not a man left on either side to maintaine the quarrell: and Florida was againe abandoned, Ao 1567. The principall Citties are 1 Arx Carolina built by the French and ruined by the enimy: 2 S. Helens. 3 S. Mathewes, built by the Spaniard. Here are also three strong forts holden by the Spaniards, and well garrisond, viz. S. Iames, S. Philip, & S. Augustine; which last was taken and burnt by Sr 
                  Fraenis Drake, Ao 1586, and is againe repaired. These three forts are all which the King of Spaine hath in this Country, so that it seemeth he is not so desirous to plant it himselfe, as to hinder others from doing it.
               
                  VIRGINIA called by the natiues Apalchen, hath on the East, Mare del Noort; on the West, we yet knowe not what limit; on the North Norumbega; and on the South, Florida. It is so fruitfull, that two acres of land will returne 400 bushells of corne. There is said to be rich vaines of Allum, Pitch, Tar, Rozen, Turpentine, store of Cedar, Grapes, Oyle, plenty of sweet Gummes, dies, timber trees, mines of iron and copper; and abundance of fruit, Fishes, Beasts, Fowle, and that hearb or grain which they call Maize.
               
               The people are of indifferent stature; they vse to paint their bodies with the pictures of Serpents, and other vgly beasts; & are cloathed in a loose mantle made of Deeres skinne, & weare an apron of the same before their nakednesse. They worship all things, and them only, which are able to hurt them, as fire, water, lightning, thunder, &c.
               There is but one entrance into this Country by Sea, which is at the mouth of a very goodly bay: the Capes on both sides, being called Cape Henry, and Cape Charles, are after in some sort fortefied. It is watred with the riuers Quibequesson, and Apanawapeske. The chiefe Towns are 1 Kequoughton, 2 Iames Towne. 3 Dalefeguift. It was discouered by the English at the directions and charges of Sr 
                  Walter Rawleigh, Anno 1584, and in honour of our Virgin Queen, was called Virginia. The English haue diuerse times gone thither to inhabit; some not liking the Country returned homewards, others abided there still, & were not long since in number about 800 men, women, and children: but now the number is much diminished, the barbarous people hauing in the yeare 1622, slaine treacherously about 300 of them. The Northerne part of this Virginia, being better discouered then the other, is called NEW ENGLAND full of good new Townes and sorts, and is likely to proue an happy plantation.
               NORVMBEGA, hath on the North, Nova Francia; on the South Virginia. The ayre is of a good temper; the soyle fruitfull; and the people indifferently ciuill: all of them, as well mē as women, painting their faces. The men are much affected to hunting, & therefore neuer giue their daughters to any, vnlesse

he be well skill'd in that game also. The women are here very chast, and so well loue their husbands, that if at any time they chance to be slaine, the widowes will neither marry, nor eate flesh, till the death of their husbands be reuenged. They both dance much, and for more nimblenesse sometimes stark naked. The chiefe Towne is called Norumbega, and is possessed by the French.
               
               NOVA FRANCIA hath on the North, Terra Corterialis; on the South, Norumbega. The earth is barren, the people barbarous. It was discouered by Iaques Cartier, of France, Anno 1534: and is inhabited besides the natiues, with some few Frenchmen. The chiefe Townes are Canada. 2 Sanguinai, seated on riuers so called. And 3 Hochelaga, a towne round in shape, and compassed about with three course of timber rampires, one within the other, sharp at the top, & two rods high. It hath about 50 great houses, & but one gate, which is shut with piles and barres. The people beleeue that when they dye they goe vnto the Starres; vnd that from thence they are conveied into certaine green fields, adorned with trees, flowres, &c. The common people which inhabit not the Townes abouenamed, dwell in their boats, which they turne vpside downe, and lye vnder them.
               TERRA CORTERIALIS, or Di Laboredora, hath on the North, Estotiland; on the South, the riuer Canada. This great riuer ariseth out of the hill called Hombuedo, his whole course is 900 miles long, 800 mile nauigable: at his aestuarium 105 miles in breadth. It is called also the riuer of the three brothers, and by some the riuer of S. Laurence. It taketh name from Gaspar Corterialis, a Portugall, who first discouered it, Ao 1500. The men are barbarous, of colour brown, swift of foot, cloathed in beasts skinnes, and are very good archers. They liue in Caues, or base Cottages, adorne themselues with siluer and brasse bracelets, and generally feed on fish. The chiefe of their Villages are 1 Breste. 2 Cabo Marzo. and 3 Santa Maria.
               
               ESTOTILAND hath on the South Terra Corterialis; and on the North, the Streights called Fretum Davisij, from Iohn Davis an Englishman: who endeauoured to finde out a more

commodious and quicke passage to Cathaia and China, than was yet discouered, by the North of America: which designe of his he beganne luckily, but accomplished it not with the like prosperous euent. Yet was not he the first that euer attempted this passage, Sebastian Cabot giuing the first ouset, Anno 1497; and Sr 
                  Martin Frobisher seconding his beginnings, 1576. He made in all three seuerall voyages, brought with him some of the natiues, and a great deale of Ore, which being in England tried, did scarce quit the cost: a great promontory hereof hee called Queene Elizabeths foreland, and the Sea running by it Frobishers straights. On the other side of these straights, lieth Groenland; and not farre distant Freizland: one of whose kings by name Zichmi, imployed Nicholas and Antonio Zeni, two brothers, to discouer the adiacent Countries. This they vndertook with a noble resolution, & performed with as much care; discouering the shore of this Country, and then returned, Anno 1390. The soyle is sufficiently enriched with naturall endowments: the inhabitants also are indued with a greater readinesse of wit, and soundnesse of iudgement, that the other Americans. This Prouince is called by vs English, New found land; and was rediscouered by some of our Captaines, 1527; who imposed most of their names, which are yet retained. The Seas about this Country abound with fish, insomuch that in 4 houres, 2 or 300 of them are commonly taken. They are hence conveyed into all parts of Europe, and vented by the name of New found land fish. The natiues vse also to fish, and venture on the great Ocean in little boats made of leather: which, when their fish is caught, they carry home vnder their armes.
               Thus much of Mexicana.
               
            
            
               OF PERVANA.
               PERVANA containeth the Southerne part of America, and is tied to Mexicana, by the Istmus or streight of Darien being no more then 17 miles broad; others make it 12 only. Certaine it is, that many haue motioned to the Counsell of Spaine, the cutting of a nauigable channell through this small Istmus,
                  
so to shorten the common voyages to China and the Moluccoes. But the Kings of Spaine haue not hitherto attempted it, partly because if he should employ the Americans in the work, he should loose those few of them, which his people haue suffered to liue: partly because the slaues, which they yearely buy out of Africa, doe but suffice for the mines and sugar-houses: but principally, least the passage by the Cape of good hope, being left off; those seas might become a receptacle of Pirats. I haue read of many the like attempts begunne, but neuer of any finished. Sesostris king of Egypt, Darius of Persia, one of the Ptolomies, and a late capricious Portugall, had the like plot, to make a passage from the red Sea, to the Mediterranean: so had Caesar, Caligula, and Nero, Emperours of Rome, vpon the Corinthian Istmus: another of the same nature had Charles the great, to let the Rhene into the Danowe: the like Lucius Verus, to ioyne the Rhene and the Rhone; all which in their peculiar places we haue already touched. Nicanor also king of Syria, intended to haue made a channell, from the Caspian to the Euxine Sea; an infinite proiect: but neither hee nor any of the rest could finish these workes; God, it seemeth, being not pleased at such prowd and haughty enterprises; and yet perhaps, the want of treasure hath not beene the least cause, why the like proiects haue not proceeded: besides the dreadfull noyses and apparitions, which (as we haue already said) continually affrighted the workemen.
               The compasse of this part of America, is 17000, of the other, 13000 miles: It comprehendeth 1 Castella Aurea. 2 Guiana. 3 Peru. 4 Brasile, 5 Chile.
               
               CASTELLA AVREA, so called for the abundance of gold; containeth the Northerne part of Peruana, and part of the Istmus. It is admirably stored with Siluer, Spices, Pearles, and medicinall hearbs: and is diuided into foure Prouinces, viz: 1 Castella del Or.o 2 Nona Andaluzia. 3 Noua Granata. 4 Cartagena.
               
               
                  Castella del Oro situate in the very Istmus, is not very populous, by reason of the vnhealthfulnesse of the ayre, & noysome sauour of the standing pooles. The chiefe Citties are 1 Theonyma,
                  
or Nombre di dios, on the East; & Panama, on the west side. They were both built by Didacus Niquesa; and the first had this name, because Niquesa hauing beene crossed with many dismall chances, and misaduentures; when he came hither, bad his men now goe on shore, en nombre di dios, in the name of god. The ayre in the place where he built them, being very vnhealththie; the King of Spaine, Ao 1584, commanded that they should be plucked, both of them, downe, and rebuilt in a more conuenient place: which was performed by Peter Aria. Through these two Townes, commeth all the trafficke that is betweene Spaine and Peru, for whatsoeuer commodity commeth out of Peru is vnladen at Panama, carried by land to Nombre di dios, and there shipped to Spaine: & vice versa.
               
               I should wrong my Countrey, in concealing the worth of her people,
                     Camden
                   if I omitted the attempt of Iohn Oxenham, one of Sr 
                  Francis Drakes followers, on this place. This man arriuing with 70 companions, a little aboue these townes, drewe a land his ship, couered it with boughs, and marched ouer the land with his company guided by Negroes, vntill he came to a riuer where he cut downe wood, made him a pinnase, entred the South Sea, went to the Ile of Pearles, lay there 10 daies, intercepted in two Spanish shippes, 60000 pound weight in gold, 100000 pound waight in barres of siluer, and returned safely againe to the maine land. And though through the mutinie of his company, he neither returned to his country, nor his hidden ship; yet is it an aduenture not to be forgotten, in that neuer by any other attempted, and by the Spanish writers, with much admiration, recorded.
               
                  Andaluzia Noua hath on the North, Castella del Oro; on the South Peru. The best Citties are Tocoio, now S. Margarets, & 2 Santa Espritta.
               
               
                  Noua Granada is situate on the south side of Carthagena: The chiefe Citties are Tungia, directly vnder the Aequator 2 Tochaimum. 3 Popaian, built by one Sebastian Belalzar, who first subdued this Country. 4 S. Foye an Archbishops seat, and a Court of Iustice. 5 Palma. and 6 Merida, called after this name from Merida in Spaine. This Country is very strong, by

reason of its situation among stonie rockes which enuiron it & through which there are very narrow passages: yet is it full of pleasing valleyes which yeeld much fruit; and hath in it some mines of gold and siluer.
               
                  Cartagena hath a fruitfull soyle, in which groweth a tree, which if any one touch he will hardly scape a poisoning. The chiefe Citties are Cartagena (called by the natiues Calamur) which Sr 
                  Francis Drake surprized, 1585; and besides inestimable summes of wealth, tooke with him from hence 240 peeces of Ordnance. 2 Abuida. 3 S. Martha on the riuer d' Abuida (called also S. Iohns, & Rio di Grand) 4 Venezuela. 5 New Cales. These three last regions are called Terra Firma, and are the Basis of this reuersed Pyramis.
               
               GVIANA hath on the East, and South, the riuer Maragnon called also Amazone, and Orellana; on the West, the mountains of Peru; and on the North, the great riuer Orenoque, or Raliana. This riuer is nauigable with ships of burden 1000 miles, but with Boats and Pinnases almost 2000 miles; and borroweth his latter name from S. Walter Raleigh, who first of all, to any purpose, made a plenary survey of this Country, her commodities, and situation, Anno 1595. The riuer Maragnon, called Amazone, from the Amazons, which are fabled to liue here; and Crellana, from one so called, who first (Anno 1543) sayled in it, is nauigable almost 6000 miles, and broad towards the Sea 200 miles.
               This country is directly situate vnder the Aequinoctiall line, and is the fruitfullest part of Peruana. The inhabitants in winter time dwell in trees for feare of inundations, making on them many artificiall Villages, and ranges of building. The like habitations they also haue in Brasil, & in Golden Castile: in which last Country, we finde Abibeiba the King hereof, to haue had his pallace on a tree; from which Francisco Vasques, a Spanish Captaine, could by no Rhetorick intreat him to descend, till he began to cut downe the tree, and then the poore Prince came downe, and bought his life at the Spaniards price. The old Iucolae were the Caribes; the present are the Samai, the Assawi, and the Wikeri, nations of Peru: which, when as Francisco Pizarro
                  
had subdued that Realme, fled hither; and driuing out the Caribes, planted themselues here.
               When this Country was first opened, and the riches of it plainely manifested, suit was made that some English forces might be sent thither, and a Colonie erected. Which motion, on mature consultation, was at last concluded to be preiudicial to the state; because of the distance of our body of warre. 2ly Because that the Spanish Armies and Colonies bordering euery way on it, might cast out our small strength

Here is also great store of Tobacco, which though in some respect, being moderately taken, may be seruiceable for Physicke: yet (besides the consumption of the purse, & impairing of our inward parts) the immoderate, vaine, and phantasticall

abuse of this hellish weed, corrupteth the naturall sweetnes of the breath, stupefieth the braine, and indeed is so preiudiciall to the generall esteeme of our Country men, that one saith of them, Anglorum corpora qui huic plantae tantopere indulgent, in Barbarorum naturam degenerasse videntur.

For the second good quality attributed vnto it, I thinke it rather to consist in opinion then truth; the rhewme which it voideth, being only that which it selfe ingendreth.

               This Prouince aboue any other in America, is abundant in Gold and Siluer; the mines wherof in diuers places, yeeld more of these mettles, then of earth: by which abundance, not Spaine only, but all Europe also, is more stored with pure & fine coine, then euer formerly it was. Our ancestors the Brittaines, vsed brasse rings, and iron rings, for their instruments of exchange, The most vsuall materiall of mony among the Roman Prouinces, was seldome gold or siluer, most times brasse, sometimes leather: Corium forma publica percussum, as Seneca hath it. This last kind of mony, was by Fredericke the second made currant when he besieged Millaine; the like is said to haue beene vsed here in England, at the time of the Barrons warres: & why not? Since no longer agoe, then in the yeare 1574, the Hollanders then being in their extremities, made mony of past-board. But this hapneth only in cases of necessity; the two mettals of gold and siluer, hauing for many hundred yeares, though not in such abundance, beene the principall instrument of exchange, & bartery; & so questionlesse will continue to the end of the world.

Now saith he, the reason why they had any gold or siluer at al among them, was not for any esteeme they had of it, but to hire and wage forraine souldiers withall, when the necessities of their state required it. How this deuice would sort with the people, which Lucian fableth to be in the Moone. I knowe not, though perhaps it might fit them well enough. But I am sure in this s

For, (as that excellent Sr

As for that question, whether of the two kingdomes be happier, that which supplieth it selfe with mony, by trafficke and the workes of art; or that which is supplied by mines in it growing, as the gift of nature: I finde it by this tale in part resolued. Two Marchants departing from Spaine to get gold, touched vpon part of Barbary; where the one buyeth Moores to dig and delue with; the other fraughteth his vessell with sheep: and being come to the Indies
                  
the one finding mines, set his slaues to worke; & the other hapning on grassie grounds, put his sheep to grasing. The slaues grow cold and hungry, call for food and cloathing; which the sheep-master by the increase of his cattle, had in abundance: so that what the one got in gold, with toyle, charges, and hazard; he gladly gaue vnto the other for continuall supplies of victualls and rayments, for himselfe and his seruants. In the end, the mines being exhausted, and all the gold thence arising being exchanged with the sheepheards, for such necessaries as nature required: home returneth the Sheepheard in triumph, his companion hauing nothing to shew for the improuement of his stocke. But I dare not determine a question so weighty, only I will tell you that the Hollanders and English, by the benefit of trafficke and marchandize only, wearied the late king of Spain

               The most luckie Prince of these 8, was Guaimacapa; who extended his Empire to the largenesse it now hath. Since his death, fortune hath frowned on them all. For his two sonnes Guascar, and Atabalipa, immediatly after the solemnizing of his funerall, striued for the Empire, till Francisco Pizarro, a Spanish Captaine, ended the controuersie; by seasing on the kingdome, to the vse of his master of Spaine. Guascar was slaine, and Atabalipa seeing the whole kingdome lay at stake, laid all his riches, life, and liberty against it; and cast the Dice on a plaine, nigh to the City Caximalos, where the Dice running on the Sp

& liberty; a house piled vp on all sides, with refined Gold & siluer, being in estimation about 10 millions: which when they had receiued, they most perfidiously slew him. His two successours laboured the restoring of their ruinated inheritance, but preuailed nothing: For the wickednesse of the Peruvian was now full, and God sent these Spaniards amongst them, as executioners of his vengeance, Anno 1533. This Pizarro who subdued this most potent and flourishing kingdome, and made it a member of the Spanish Empire, was borne at Trusiglio, a village of Navarre, and by the poore whore his mother, laide in the Church porch, and so left to Gods prouidence: by whose direction, (there being none found that would giue him the brest) he was nourished for certaine dayes, by sucking a Sow. At last, one Gonsalles, a soldier, acknowledged him for his sonne, put him to nurse, and when he was somewhat growne, set him to keepe his swine: some of which being strayed, the boy durst not for feare returne home, but betooke himselfe to his heeles, ran vnto Sevill, and there shipped himselfe for America; where he so prospered, that he was by the King of Spaine honoured for his good seruice, with the title of Marquesse Anatillo, Anno 1535. The strange fortunes of this man, call into my minde the like of Sinan, a great Bassa in the court of Selimus the first; who being borne of base parentage, as he being a child was sleeping in the shade, had his genitals bitten off by a Sow. The Turkish Officers which vsually prouided yong boyes for the seruice of the Grand Signeur, being in Epyrus, (for that was Sinans country) and hearing of this so extraordinary an Eunuch, tooke him among others, along with them to the Court: where vnder Mahomet the great, Baiaz

But this is perhaps impertinent.
               BRASILE hath on the North Guiana; on the South, Rio de la Plate, & Chile; on the East, the Ocean; and on the West, the mountaines of Peru, called the Andes; which diuide the

Country of Peruana, as Taurus or Imaus doe Asia; and mount Atlas, Africke. These hills are high, craggie, and very barren; full of rauenous beasts, and poisonous serpents, which they say destroyed a whole Army of one of the Peruvian Kings, in their passages that way. Here also liue a mountaine people, farre more barbarous then the rest of the Americans, as being hairie all ouer their bodies, going altogether naked, and liuing without houses or bedding. And so I descend into the valleyes of this Country.
               The Aire here is of a healthfull temper, the Earth fat and alwaies flourishing. Great store of Sugars, and wonderfull rich mines, are the sinewes of this Region. Hence commeth our red wood, which we vse in dying of cloathes, called Brasile; the trees of which are of that bignesse, that whole families liue in an arme of one of them, euery tree being as populous as many of our Villages For which cause the cities here are neither many, faire, nor populous. They which are, are called 1 S. Anna Equitum, 2 Ascensio, 3 Pernambuco, or Pernambucke, from whence I suppose that that Brasil wood is with vs called Fernanbucke, which they vse in dying and colouring cloathes red.

These festiuall daies are, when a company of good neighbours come together to be merry, ouer the roasted body of a fat man, whom they cut in collops called Boucon, and eat with g

                  sse, and as much delectation. They haue two vile qualities, they are mindfull of iniuries, and forgetfull of benefits. The men cruell without measure, and the women infinitely lasciuious. They cannot pronounce the letters LFR: The reason of which one being demaunded, made answere, because they had amongst them neither Law, Faith, nor Rulers. They are rather swimmers, as well women as men, and wil stay vnder water an houre together. Women in trauell are here deliuered

without any great paine, and presently goe about their businesse belonging to good house-wiues: The good-man (according to the fashion of our kinder sort of husbands in England, who are said to breed their wiues children) being sicke in their steed, and keeping their bed; so farre that he hath brothes made him, is visited by his gossips or neighbours, & hath iunkets sent to comfort him.
               There is in this country a litle beast, which cannot goe in lesse then 15 dayes, as farre as a man can throw a stone; and is therefore called by the Spaniards, Pigritia. Here is also an herbe called Sentida, or Viua; which if one touch it, will shut its leaues and not open them, till the man which did displease it be gone out of sight: Here also flying fishes are said to be, but I binde you not to beleeue it.
               This Country was first discouered by Peter Alvari Caprali, at the expences of Emanuel K. of Portugal, Anno 1500: more exactly surveyed by Americus Vespuccius, at the charges of the said Emmanuell: next by Iohn di Empoli, a Florentine, 1503: afterward by Iohn Stadius, a German, Anno 1554. And by the Edict of Pope Alexander the sixt, was appropriated to the Portugall; the rest of America being allotted to the Castilians. In the right of Portugall, the Castilians now possesse it; though (as 
                     •
                  eport goeth) they are like to loose their footing. For it is said, that the West-Indian company of the vnited Prouinces, haue taken a Towne called Todos los Sanctos, standing on a capacious Bay, with the forts belonging to it; and haue since marched higher into the Country to besiege Pernanbuco, the chief town of it.
               CHILE hath on the East, the Virginian Ocean; on the West, Mare del Zur; on the North, Peru; on the South, the straights of Magellanus. It containeth two Prouince
                     •
                  , viz: Chica, and the Patagones. It taketh denomination from the vehemencie of the cold here, (the name, it seemeth, importing as much;) which is said to be such, especially in our Summer Solstice, that horses and their riders are frozen to death, and hardened like a peece of marble. The Country toward the midland, is very mountainous and vnfruitfull; toward the sea shore, leuell,

fruitfull, and watred with diuerse riuers, flowing from the mountaines; this being the chiefe benefit the Country reapeth from them. The Spaniards finde here good plenty of golde, abundance of hony, store of cattell, and of wine enough for their owne vse: the vines brought hither out of Spaine, exceedingly prospering, as also doe all their fruits, and plants, from thence transplanted hither.
               The people are very warlike, and of a gigantine stature; as being 11 foot high. Here is a riuer which runneth in the day time with a most violent force; and in the night hath in it no water at all: The reason is, that this riuer hath no constant spring, but is both begun and continued by snow falling from the mountaines; which in the heat of the day melteth into waters, and are precipitately carried to the Sea: but in the chilly coldnesse of the night, are congealed; and cannot minister new supplies to the empty Channell.
               This Country was discouered by Almagrus, one of Pizarroes colleagues: and subdued by one Baldiuia, who being vnfortunatly taken prisoner by the inraged Chilois, was choaked with melted gold.
               The chiefe Townes are 1 Arequipoum, much defaced by an Earthquake, 1582: 2 S. Iames, built by the Spaniards, 3 Cocimbum, 4 Villadiues, 5 Baldiuia, which for spight to its founder, was pulled downe, Anno 1599: and 6 The Imperiall, which is the best Colonie of this Country; and was, before the taking of it by the Spaniards, so populous and rich, that in a war against the Araugues their neighbours, they put into the field 300000 fighting men. It was called by the Spaniards, Imperiall; because at their first comming into this Prouince, they found Eagles with two heads, made of wood, set vpon the doores & houses of it, made perhappes by some Germans which had beene here shipwracked.
               The Pyris of this American Pyramis, is called Caput Victoriae, from the ships name, wherein some of Magellanus Souldiers, by this Cape did first compasse the world. This Ferdinando Magellanus a Spaniard, and expert in navigation▪ was earnestly intreated by Charles the fift, to finde (if possible it might be)

a shorter cut to the Moluccoes; this request, he willing to performe, addressed himselfe to the voyage, Anno 1520, and striking Southward, passed along by this Cape; and so through the narrow Seas, since called Fretum Magellanicum, and being now arriued at the Moluccoes, was there killed in a battaile against the Ilanders; but the ship called Victoria, returned to Spaine in safety.
               We vse to say that Sir Francis Drake was the first that sayled round about the world, which may bee true in a mitigated sense; viz: that he was the first Captain or man of note that atchieued this enterprise; (Magellanus perishing in the midst of it:) and therefore is reported to haue giuen for his deuice a Globe with this motto, Tu primus circumdedisti me. This navigation was begun Anno 1577, and in two yeares and a halfe, with great vicissitude of fortune, finished: concerning which his famous voyage, a Poët then liuing directed to him this Epigramme:

                     Drake, pererrati nouit quem terminus orbis,
                     Quem

                     Sol nescit comitis immemor esse sui.
                     Drake whom th'encompass'd earth so fully knew,
                     And whō at once both poles of heauen did view;
                     Should men forget, the Sun could not forbeare
                     To chronicle his fellow-trauailer.
                  
               
               This Fretum Magellanicum, these Magellan straights, are by M. Iohn Dauies, who professeth to know euery creeke in them, thus described. For 14 leagues within the Cape of S. Marie, lieth the first straight, where it ebbeth and floweth with a violent swiftnes: the straight not being fully halfe a mile broad, and the first fall into it very dangerous and doubtfull. Three leagues this straight continueth, when it openeth into a sea, 8 miles long, and as many broad; beyond which lyeth the second straight, right West South-West from the first, a perillous and vnpleasing passage, 3 leagues long, and a mile in bredth. This straight openeth it selfe into another Sea, which is extended euen to the Cape of Victorie, where is the straight properly called

the straight of Magellane: a place of that nature, that which way soeuer a man bend his course, he shall be sure to haue the winde against him. The length hereof is 40 leagues; the bredth in some places 2 leagues, in others not halfe a mile; the channell on the shore-side 200 faddome, and so no hope of ancorage; the course of the water full of turnings and changings, and so violent, that when a ship is once entred, there is no returning. On both sides are the high mountaines, continually couered with snow, from whence proceede those dangerous counterwindes that beat on all sides of it: a place certainly vnpleasing to view, and hazardous to passe. So farre, and to this purpose, M. Dauies.

               THE AMERICAN ILANDS.
               The AMERICAN ILANDS are either

                     In the Verginian Sea, or Mare del Noort.
                     
                     In the Pacifique Sea, or Mare del Zur.
                     
                  
               
               THe Ilands in the Pacifique Ocean, or Mare del Zur, are

                     1 INSVLAE SOLOMONIS, which are in number many: the chiefe of which are 18, the rest not worth the looking after. Of these 18, the three greatest are, Gaudalcanall, S. Thome, and S. Isabella. The Ilanders are of a yellowish colour, and goe naked. They were discouered by Lope Garcia di Castro, Anno 1567: and called Insulae Solomonis, because he thought them to be the land of Ophir, to which Solomon sent for his gold.
                     2 INSVLAE LATRONVM, vsually called Ladrones, were discouered by Magellanus; who gaue them that name, because the inhabitants stole away his cock boate.
                  
               
               The Ilands of the Verginian Ocean, so called a vergendo, or Mare del Noorte, are

                     1 MARGARITA, and CVBAGNA, situate nigh vnto Castella Aurea. They are deficient in Corne, Grasse, Trees, and Water; insomuch that sometimes the people gladly change for a tunne of Water, a tunne of wine. The abundance of precious

stones, maketh some amends for these defects, from whence the name of Margarita is imposed on it: in especiall, it yeeldeth the gemmes which the Latine Writers call Vniones, because they alwaies grow in couples.

                     3 TRINIDADO is not farre distant from the former. It was discouered by Columbus, in his last voyage, Anno sc: 1497: and is well stored with Tobacco.
                     
                     4 BACALAOS are certaine Iles iying against the influxe of Canada, nigh vnto Corterialis; and owe their first discouery vnto Sebastian Cabot, Anno 1447. The people of these Ilands, in their most formall expression of reuerence to their King, vse to rubbe their noses, or stroake their for-heads: which if the king accepteth or obserueth, and meaneth to grace the party so adoring him, he turneth his head to his left shoulder; which is a note of especiall fauour.
                     5 BORIQVEN is diuided into 2 parts, whereof the North part is most plentifull of gold; the South part, of vitall prouision; as birds, cattle, and corne. Some riuers here are, but of no greatnesse; the principall being called Cairobonus. This Iland is 
                           •
                        ituate North of Guiana. It is in length 50, in bredth 18 miles; and is called also Insula S. Iohan. The first that set foot in it was Iohn Ponce a Spaniard, Anno 1527. The principall cities are S. Iohns, and 2 Port Rico; ruin'd by Henry Earle of Cumberland, Anno 1597.
                     6 IAMAICA or Insula S. Iacobi, was once very populous, but now almost destitute of inhabitants; the Spaniards hauing slaine in this and the former Iland, more then 60000 liuing soules: insomuch that women, as well here, as on the Continent, did kill their children before they had giuen them life; that the issues of their bodies might not serue so cruell a nation. This Iland is in length 280 miles, in bredth 70 miles. It is well watred hath two townes of note; Oristana, and Seuill; & acknowledgeth Columbus for its first discouerer.
                     7 CVBA, called also Fernandina, is long 300, and broad 70 miles. It is full of Forrests, Lakes, and mountaines: and was

first made knowne to the Europaeans, by Columbus his second navigation. The people here are prohibited the eating of serpents, as a dainty reserued for the higher powers. The Ai

It aboundeth also with ginger, cassia, masticke, aloes, cinamom, sugar, and hath of flesh, fish, and fowle, no scarcity. The people before the Spaniards arriuall here, were tenants in common, money not being knowne among them, nor the meaning of meum and tuum vnderstood by them. The chiefe Cities are S. Iago, a Bishops See: and Hauana a safe rode for shippes, and the staple of Merchandise. Here also rideth the King of Spaine's Navie, till the time of the yeare, and the conveniency of the winde, ioyne together to waste them homeward. It is seated on the Northerne shore, as also is S. Iago, this last being built by Iago, or Iames de Valasco, and of him so named. The other Towns of note are S. Christophero, and 4 S. Trinitie on the South.

                     9 BERMVDAE, are called also Summer Ilands, because Sir Thomas Summers gaue vs a more exact relation of them, then before had beene. They receiued their first name from one Iohn Barmudaz, who first gaue vs notice of them: they are in number no lesse then 400: The biggest resembling a halfe Moone, hath in it a Colonie of English; who affirme it to bee very fruitfull, and agreeable to an English nature.
                     10 HISPANIOLA, called by the natiues, Haitie; now lamenteth the losse of 3 millions of her inhabitants, murdred by her new masters of Spaine. It is in compasse 1400 miles: inioyeth a temperate Aire, a fertile soyle, rich mines, Amber, & Sugar. In 16 dayes herbes will ripen, and roots also, and be fit to be eaten: a strong argument of the exact temperature of the Aire. It giueth place in no respect to Cuba, but excelleth it in diuerse, three especially: 1 the finenesse of the gold, which is here digged more pure and vnmixed: 2ly in the increase of the sugar; one sugar-cane here filling 20, and sometimes 30 measures: and

3ly in the goodnesse of their soyle for tillage, the corne here yeelding an hundred folde. This fertility is thought to be caused by foure great riuers, which water and enrich all the foure quarters of the Country, viz: 1 Iuna, the East; 2 Attihinnacus, the West; 3 Iacchus, the North; and 4 Naihus, the South▪ all foure springing from one mountaine, which standeth in the very midst and center of the Country.
