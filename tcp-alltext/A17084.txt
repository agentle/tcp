            I taught furthermore that the matter it selfe geueth euydent iudgement how so many ministers of religion are not found, that make them selues chast for the kyngedom of heauens sake, as there shoulde be, whiche abstinence is onely meate for preesthode.

any estimatiō, as they ought to be (for they hange vpon Gods verie worde & lawe) proue that of a thousande preestes at this daye, scarse on can be founde whiche may remaine in this holye ministerye: & that not allonlie for their vitious and filthie castitie, but also because they be entangled in the busines of the worlde & are nother learned nor diligent to feade the lordes flocke, so that they take not their v

            This foundations therfor of oure trenth, Uvinchester going about to vnderminde, fyrst hath taken vpon him to defende that interpretaciō of Christes wordes, All men can not awaye with that saing &c. And he that can take it, let him take it: wherin not a fewe wold haue this words (take, & cā take) to be of like signification wt (wil take) as tought the lord wolde haue saide: All men wil

not take this sainge, & he that will take it, let hym take it: and hereof he picked a quarell that I wold haue this the lordes sainges spoken by a fygure in Rhetorike named Ironia, no otherwise then it is communely said of a thi

            For soethe (as all men may reade in my booke vnto Latomus) I spake not a worde of Ironia, but haue therin manifefflye confessed that it is graunted to manye to take thys sainge, yet not to al. And I go about there that which the lord spake euidently: All take not this saing. And let him take it that cā, for he said not, all wyll not take this, & he that will, let him take if.
            Uvho doubteth that Christ our lord the onlye geuer of trewe & holy chastitie, and chefe alower of the same, yf he had put in euerie mans wyll to take it, and had not thought to permit manie more to receaue copled chastitie, then abstinence, at the sai

But that he wolde not haue all to folwe this kinde of lyuing, yet that they shoulde whiche are willinge, and he wyll not fayle to helpe suche as secke and laboure for it. But now it is not so, for he said on this maner. All can not away with that saing, sauinge they to whom it is geuen. By the whith wordes (if ye wreste and writhe them not) what other thinge I praye yow may a man gather, but that the lord saide: All take not this thinge, because it is not geuen to al, but to certaine men only, electe from aboue to this kinde of lyuinge.

            S. Hierom in dede a great defender of the solitarie lyfe writ against Iouinianus,S. Hier. in that booke wherin he defendeth to the vtter moste, the diguitie of trewe chastitie.
If al might be virgiues the lorde wold neuer haue said, he that can take it, let him take it: And the Apostle wold neuer haue sticked to swade the same. Also he writtinge vpon the selfe same place of Mathewe, after he had denied yt this the lordes sainge (they alone take that saing to whom it is geuen) shold be referred to destyme, fortune or chaunce, but muste be vndrstanded that it is geuen to such as praye, make dilygence inquisytion and laboure to get it, shewed this reason of that his exposytyon.
Bycause all that aske, do receaue, & that seke, do fynde, and to them that knocke, the dore is opeind. Notwythstandynge sone after he expounded (he that can take it, let hym take it) he added this whervpō (he saith) the lord bringeth in.

Hila. that the lorde wolde therbye admonishe vs to be lyke vnto him, which hath willingly decred to be vnmaried, yf we can: he saith not, if we will So S. Austine also wher as he writteth.S. Augustin. De adulterinis nuptijs .xix. capi. ad Pollentium, speaketh of that the Apostle writ (he that ioyneth hys virgin in mariage▪ doth well, but he yt doth not ioyne his virgin in mariage, doth better) and saith,he is prouoked yt can take it. who so can take it, is motioned vnto the better by the Apostles counsayle. Marke, he saith not, that euerye man is motioned to chastitie by the Apostles cousayll, but they onlye which can take it.
            Upon this S. Gregorie also in his booke De pastorali cura,S. Gre. capi. xxix. Part. iij. writeth that the faithfull and godlye shepherdes should admonishe the chast, that if they sustaine the stormes of temptatiōs with the diffycultie of their helth, they should drawe to the

               e fassyon, as we. Yet is not Uvynchester ashamed to affyrme, and write that we interpreted it of oure owne braine, and otherwise then the right opinionid haue done. And therfor ye see by thys one place what a thankelesse thinge it is to answere such manifeste, and impudent quarellynges, and brablinges. Yet do I not gainsaye but Uvinchester hathe certaine of the olde writers whom he recitethe for the authores of his interpretation, though they be verye fewe, and in thys exposytyon not to be compared withe ours. And besydes that, the lordes verie saing maketh with vs. Ye se therfore by what audacitie Uvynchester hath written that we brought this interpretation out of our owne brayne, and contrarie to the meaninge of the right opinionid.
            And when I had confyrmed oure interpretation which we brought, by S. Pauls anthotitie, alleaginge this place: I wold all men were as I my selfe ame. But euerie man hathe

his proper gyft of God, one after this maner an other after that. Uvynchester went about to wreste and writhe this place also. For he saith: In that, some men haue not the gyfte of Chastity it is by theyr owne defalt, for God offereth thys gyfte equally. And of this hys saynge he bringeth thre reasons. One bycause Saynt Paule sayth.Uvynchester taketh it to be spoken vndeterminatly, thoughe it be spokē determinatly It is good for a man not to towche a woman: and sayth not, it is good for hym, or hym, but vndeterminatelye for all. And for a more probation thereof he addeth. I wolde all men were as I my selfe am, but the Apostle wolde not haue wysshed for all, the thynge that colde by no meanes agre to al, or disagre to Gods bountyfull goodnes, that he shold geue it to some only with respecte of parsonnes, whiche he spake by the Apostles mouthe to be expedyent for all men.
            
               Bicause ye Apo. wisshed all to be chaste, it is not cō
                  cluded, ye chastitie is profitable for all.Do ye not se (most deuout mē) how moche thys Bysshope presumeth vpō Gods worde? Dyd the Apostle then speake vniuersally and vndeterminatlye (It is good, & to be desyreth for of

all men not to touche a woman) because he saide I wolde all men were as I my selfe ame? Dyd he not furthwithe add a contraction and exposytion of his sauing. But euerie man hathe hys proper gift of God, one after this maner an other after that, and immediatlye after. They that can not abstaine, let them marye. Also, It is better to marie, thē to burne. As to his forsaing, It is good for a mā not to touche a woman. He added incontinently hys exposytion. But for to auoide fornicatiō, let uery man haue his wyfe?
            Uvhich when Uvinchester interpreteth of him yt is now already maried, & saith that it is good for such an one to touche his wyfe, if she also agre not to vnmaried state. Notwithstāding euery maried man ought to rendre mutualle beneuolence of wedlocke to his wyfe, agreable to the holie ghoste. How dare he be so bolde to saye that God speake by the mouthe of Paule that it is conuenient and good for all vniuersallye and vndeterminatlye, not to touche a woman? Uynchester therfor after his

accustomed maner vnderstod it here to be spoken vniuersallye & vndeterminatlye, which is spoken particulerlye and determinatlye. And so of a false argument a man may brynge in what he lyste.
            Also if Paule had not added suche an euident and oft recited exposytyon after thys hys saynge vndeterminate. Yet by thes wordes (I wolde all men were, as I my selfe ame) it colde not be gathered, that abstinence therfor shold be such a gift whiche God of hys infynyte bountie sholde geue vnto all, vnlesse he wylbe counted parciale, and to haue respect of parsons. The selfe same thynge dothe he write to the Corinthians in the same Epistle, xiiij. chap. (I wolde ye all spake with tunges,Bicause the Apostle said, I wolde yt ye all spaeke wt thūgs and prophecieed, it foloweth not yt it is good for al to speake with tū
                  ges. bnt rather that ye propheryed) & addeth to thys hys wyshe no contraction, as he dyd before cōcerning chastitie. Hereof therfor (yf Uyinchesters argumet be trew) we may conclude that all they whiche onlye put to theyr

wyll and praye, maye receaue the gift of tunges & prophecie of GOD. And that it is contrarie to Gods bountyful goodnes to geue that thinge to certaine with respecte of parsons, whiche he hath spoken by the Apostles mouthe so manifestlye to be good and worthie to be desyred for of all men. But the holy ghost spake by Paul yt he distributeth his giftes as he thinketh mete and that without respect of parsons. For he hathe respect of no parson, but onlie hys holye and iuste will, and vtylytie of his churche, when to one he geueth the gyft of prophetye, to an other the gift of thunges, to an other the gift to discerne spirytes, to an other the gyft to heale, to an other the gyft to gouerne & rule. So in lyke case dothe he geue to an other the gift to leade a solitarye life, to an other to 
                  •
               e coopled in holye matrymonye, regardinge no parson, but onlye accordinge to his vocation, and commoditie of his churche.
            Uverfor as by ye saīg of ye apostle (I

wolde ye all prophecied) is it not concluded that this gyft is therfor geuen of Gods immunifycens to all, or that there is respect of parsons before God So maye it be moche lesse concluded, that because the Apostle wisshed all to be vnmaried as he hym selfe was, chastitie sholde therfor be good for all men in this present lyfe, and geuen of God, or that God hathe respecte of parsone. For when the Apostle had wisshed chastitie vnto all, he added a moderation of this his generall wishe, whiche after the wyshe of prophecye he did not. Also it is manifeste that the gift of prophecye, of it selfe, bryngeth a lytle more profyt to the churches, then dothe the gyft to be vnmaried.
            But what nede so moche a do? Did not the Apostle playnlye saye, and wythout anye exposytyon, the fyrst Timothe. fyfte, I wyll the yonger we, men to marye? May we therfor herof conclude takynge for example Uvinchesters argument, that it is good for all yonger Uvomen to marye,

and euyll, yf any vnmaried kepe her selfe chaste in the lorde? And whē the same S. Apostle said:Rom. ix I haue wysshed my selfe to be cursed from Christ, may we cōclude that it were better for him to be caste out of Christes fauoure, thē raigne with him in heauen? Ye se therfore (Christiā people) yt so much erudition & foresight is not in this Bisshoppe, as furiousnes & crakyng agaīst vs.
            Let vs now come to Uvinchesters other reason wherewith he goeth aboute to proue,Uvynchesters seconde reason▪
                that God geueth the gyfte of chastitie equallye to all men. He sayth, there are onlye two conditions of oure lyfe,Iu. i. Epistola Uvin toniensis Ca. 4 the maryed and the vnmaryed state, and God geueth to euery man the possybylytie of them both. And ther for offereth vnto euery man the election of them bothe also, and al necessaryes appertaynyng there vnto. Uvhich yf he should not, to ye one condition should pertayne no wil, election or possibilitie agreable to hys gyft: but rather compultion, & should ryghtlye to the one parte be named constraynt, which is farre alienate frō
               
the gyfte and vocation:Uvynchesters two false principles that God of what thī
                  ges he leaveth fre election, he geueth also the facultie of the same thī
                  ges, and excepte he do so, he compelleth them. and that God sholde not seme to be liberall towardes some. This is Uvynchesters secōd reason, wherin he declarethe agayne his stiffe audacity in taking principles whiche God neyther graunted him, nor we. Uvhereof the one is, That what thinges or cōditions of lyfe, god hathe graunted euerye mā in generallye to chose which of thē he wil, therof also he geueth euerye man powre to take whiche he will & to vse it to him selfe. The seconde is For all that god by his Apostle offerithe to euery man fre election of Chastitie or matrimonie: & yf he geue not power acordinglie to eche one yt he may receaue whether of thē he willi yet dothe he not in dede geue yt fre electiō, though in wordes he setteth it furth by yt Apostle generallye, but euery mā muste be dr

               te all good artes in mans fre power, no lesse then chastitie and matrimonye. For yf any man chose to hym the arte of tyllynge the grounde, or any handy craft, or anye arte whiche hathe the vse of reason in it,God geueth not furthe with the power of thes thī
                  nges, wherof he hath made fre election. in that forsoeth by it selfe he sinneth not. For good neuer prohibited anye to learne these artes. Wherof truelye can not followe that God therfore geueth to euerye one the verye facultie, that what arte soeuer a man hath chosen to him, the same also he may throughlye learne, and that without God geue it, he shoulde seme not to be liberall towardes some. As for example, yf anye be made and borne to the workes of the bodye, and verye vnapte to those artes, wherevpon the exercyse of the mynde consisteth, but yf he put hys wyll to, and wyll pray that he maye be indued with the facultye to learne many tunges, and the Philosophycall artes muste it therfor be graunted that god (yf he wyll

not seme to shewe more liberalitie to some then to other) will graunte hym that facultie that he may be shortlye cunnynge in many tunges and artes? But to spreade abroade and to furnish Gods kyngedom, the knoweledge of tunges and good artes are of more effecte, then to be without a wyfte: whiche thyng chauncheth bothe to childrē and fooles, and yet by their chastitie may they not profit the churche, as the other can that are indued with good artes.
            God in verye dede hath left to men fre chose of al thynges, conditions of of lyfe, and actions, wherof he gaue not preceptes expressedly. And thys chose he wyll not haue done rashely, & vnknowen to him, but circumspectely and godlye: that is to saye, makynge diligent inquisition therfor (after the inuocation of hys spirite) wherevnto God hath created euery man apt and called hym. For we must with diligēce searche out in all thynges, what pleaseth the Lorde and looke that we lyue circumsyectely not as fooles, but as

wyse: not as vnwyse, but as vnderstā
               dyng what the lordes pleaser is.Eph. v. And by Gods verye gyftes and faculties, whiche he hath geuen to euerye man, it muste be knowen, to what kynde of lyfe, to what artes and actions he hath destyned eche one. For to what kynde of lyfe so euer god hath destined euery one and made hym, to the same also geueth he vnto euerye one aboundantly gyftes and facultyes, whiche the wyse men emonge the Heythen acknowleged. And therfor in the educatiō and bryngyng vp of youth, they gaue commaundement firste of all to looke vnto what arte and estate euery one semeth to be borne and made.
            Nother may God therfore be counted to kepe backe hys liberalitie from some, yf he geue not to al lyke gyftes, seynge he geueth verye manye to all men:i. Co. xij althoughe to some one and to some other. Nother maye it therfore be sayde, that God heareth not the prayers of some contrarye to hys promyse. For God promysed not to geue eare to oure prayer, whatsoeuer we aske

of hym:God wil geue all thynges whiche we aske in the name of hys sonne, but by hys name we can aske nothyng perfectlye, but suche thynges as belōg to hys glorye. but yf we aske oughte of hym throwghe the name of his sonne, by whose name we cā aske nothinge perfectlye, and without this condition, yf the father will haue that we aske to be of anye valu to sanctyfye his name, granishe and aduaunce his kyngdome, sauinge thos gyftes, wherof we haue receaued his expressed preceptes, that we sholde desire them. Yf that be trew we haue no precept to require of him anie power to lyue without a wife. as we haue to pray for the increace of faithe and loue, and all thinges in general which the father wolde haue to preuaile anie thinge to the sanctifiynge of his name, and aduauncement of his kingdome. Therfor Whynchesters firste principle of his second reason is false. that is to say. That God geuethe to euery man the facultie and gyftes to obtaine & performe al thinges wherof in his scriptures he hathe left fre election. or that he semethe to withdrawe his liberalitie from some.
            And no lesse vaine is Uvynchesters other principle, That God hathe not

left to man fre wil to chose chastitie or mariage, but euerye man must of necessitie be compelled and constrayned to the one,God therfore compelleth not to anye kynde of lyfe, bycause he callethe theyder, and leadeth withe hys gyftes. Yf God geue not lyke facultye to euery one, to take eyther, whether it be chastitie or matrimony. For Christes spirite (whereby al gods chyldren are leade) bryngeth to passe, that euerye one which is willyng taketh the kynde of lyfe, wherevnto he feeleth hymselfe to be called from aboue by thesame spirite and giftes geuen to the same. And seyng that God distributeth to hys chyldren hys gyftes and spirituall facultyes, for thys onely purpose, that they shoulde take in hande the functions of lyfe, whiche he hathe appoynted before vnto euery man with a more sure iudgemente of mynde, and a more ready and constant wil. In verye dede Wynchester bringeth in thys verye vncircumspectlye and to baselye for a diuine, that men stopped from free wyll and election, shoulde be compelled to chastitie or matrimonye. Yf it be trewe whiche we affirme, that one receauethe

of God that gyft of matrimonie, & an other the gyft of chastitie, and that no man can take vpon him holie chastitie, but he to whom it is peculierlie geuē: like as he cā not also take holie matrimonie, whiche hathe not receaued the gyft therof.God leaueth vnto his the fre election of many thynges but that he ruleth accordyng to hys arbitryment. And God dothe not so distribute the fre election of thinges, cō
               ditions, and actions, of this presēt lyfe to his, that when as he hathe geuen to euerie man some certaine kinde of lyfe and actiōs, he sholde so moche the lesse lead and guide him withe his spirite & instructe him withe his gyftes. And barrethe them not therfor from their fre electiō & arbitrimēt, nor cōstraineth them, bycause he leadeth hys in al pathes to the whiche he hath chosen, destined, & made eche one, & distributed his gyftes, for he bringeth to effect in his, bothe to will ād to do what so euer shalbe for their profit, acordinge to his fatherlie beneuolence towardes thē.
            In his lawe hath set furthe lyfe and deathe to euery mā, and therof geueth fre choyse. Yet dothe he effectouslie moue his electe to chose lyfe, that is,

the obedience of the lawe,God draweth hys to hys sonne, yet for all yt they come vnto hym of theyr fre wyl. and to refuse deathe, that is, the disobedience of the lawe, and mouethe not the other so effecteouslie, whiche also the better schoolmē knewe. And by this meanes it is that as thei nother heare nor learne of the father, and he drawethe them not to his sonne, so maye they not come to Christe oure lorde: Yet are they nother compelled to deathe, nor the other to lyfe: Nother maye the other boaste that they haue receaued lyfe, without the peculier gyft of God, and suche a gyft as is not shewed to some: nor they complaine that they haue iniurye, yf owght be kept from thē, that is geuen to other. Of this pointe s. Austine speakethe verie wiselie in his booke:S. Austyne cōcernyng the gyft of continence. De sancta virginitate, cap. 40. And the Apostle speakethe of Continence it selfe (but I wolde al mē were as I my selfe ame, notwithstandinge euerie mā hathe his proper gyft of God, one after this maner, an other after that) who therforgeuethe thes thīges? Uvho distributeth his owē to euery man as he thinketh beste? Truelye

GOD, with whome is no parcialitie. And hereby to knowe by what equitie he distributeth to one after thys maner, to an other after that, it is other impossyble for man to knowe, or verye harde. Yet is there no doubte, but he doeth it with equity. For what hast thou, whiche thou receaueste not? or by what frowardnes wilt thou loue hym lesse, of whome thou hast receaued so largelye? These are hys wordes, In the whiche marke howe thys man of God graunteth that suche as make them selues chaste for the kyngdom of heauens sake, receaue a farre greater gyfte of God, then other, and that of Gods very fre wil, who distributeth hys owne to euery man, as he thinketh beste, and not for theyr powers and facultyes whiche they haue receaued equallye with other. It is therfor manyfest, by that we haue here alleaged, making with vs the better parte of the holye fathers, that some are so indued with holy matrimonye, and other with holye chastitie, that the one can not commodyously receaue

matrimony, nor the other chastitie for their furtherance, and therfor it cā no
                  •
                be gathered how the one sholde be cō
               pelled and constrayned to chastitie, or the other to matrimonie, hauing their fre will and electiō barred from them: so that therbye the cleane contrarye may well be concluded: that is to say. That euery man shold take and folow the kind of lyfe destined vnto him, withe a sure and Godlie election, and a pure and fre wil, seing he hathe receaued of God gyftes, and spirituall faculties to the same.
            The thirde reason he saithe he bringethe againste me bycause that in his opinion,Uvynchesters thyrd reason. I denied the extremitie of his induction agaynste reason, seinge I graunted the first parte. For belike he supposethe that God geuethe the gyft of chastitie to all, by such an inductiō: God gaue this gyft to Paul, he gaue it to S. Iohan, and gaue it to manie a thowsande in tymes paste bothe Mō
               kes & Nunnes: Nother hath he at this day withdrawē it cleane a way. Ther

for he geuethe it to all desiring it hartelie, and labouring greatlye to obtayne the same: Uvhich when I denie, he requireth of me an expressid testimonie of scripture, wherby the largenes of this gyft sholde not extende so farr as to al: & accuseth me of vnshamfastenes and rashenes for denijnge I knew not what. To say, bycause I denyed without an expressed testimonye of scripture, that God geueth the gyfte of chastitie to all willynge, and to suche as laboure for it, seing I graunted he gaue it to some.
            
               Uvynchester layth to Bucer, that he speketh without scripture, yet doth he hymself recite the scriptures whiche he followeth in thys behalfe & teacheth not whether thei be well recyted or no.But when Uvynchester had bethawght hym self that I denyed not without authoritie of scripture, that God geueth the gyfte of chastitie to al: at lengthe he hym selfe recyteth the testimonyes of scripture, whiche I folowe in thys behalfe, after he had sufficientlye refresshed hym selfe with hys

               aylynge wordes: namelye thys .i. Co. iij. Euery man hathe hys proper gyfte of God, one after this maner, an other after yt. And that one is called to matrimony, & an other to chastitie, as god calleth

one to bōdage, an other to liberty. But whē he seeth yt these testimonyes of scripture are more euydent, then he can cōfute, he passeth them ouer stoutlye, and in the meane season maketh an out crye, that I am a stowte defende, and sayth. I had not in mynde by these thynges, to debilitat and ouerthrowe my reasons, whiche I brynge concernynge Goddes diuerse gyftes, & vocation. But he bryngeth no other argumente of thys hys crakynge, sauynge allonely that schoolishe reason, which ryght nowe we confuted. That bothe gyftes are offered vnto all men, els shoulde there be no chose of the one because of one parte there is no chose, & it can not be wel sayd, yt he may take chastitie, which maye not also leaue it.
            But we haue shewed that bycause God hath offered to hys in hys scriptures the fre election of diuerse thynges, it foloweth not therfor that he geueth to euerye one lyke power for bothe partes, and for euerye thynge lyke gyftes. For God hathe set furth (as I foresayd) to all men death and lyfe, and

the fre election, whiche he hath lefte of them bothe: But for so muche as the holpe chose lyfe, receauynge Christ in faythe, that can they not do withoute they be indued with the spirite of faythe: and they can not sinne, that is chose deathe, bycause they haue remaynynge vpon them the seade of God, that is to saye, the efficacye & strength of faythe, and blessed regeneration, and yet by thys gyfte of fayth it is so farre of, that ye fre wyll is taken frō the godlye, In so moche that by thys gyfte theyr wyll is made fre in dede at the fyrste,Ioh. viij. as the trewe libertie commeth of the Lorde onelye and of hys spirite.ij. Co. iij. ¶These thynges whiche he bryngeth oute of hys philosophye.Thys is false yf a man can do any thynge by the gyfte of god, that he maye as well not do thesame.

                matter. For we entreat of here Gods gyftes and faculties which are not geuen to bothe partes, but to one. For he that is indued withe the gyft of wisdome or faithe: we say with good reasō that

he maye be wise, and not as well, that he may be foolyshe, That he may beleue and not as well that he can not beleue. And so after the same maner, he that hathe the gyfte of holye, chastitie, we saye with good reason that he can lyue a solitary life with godlynes: and not as well that he can receaue the cō
               trarye waye of lyuynge. Ye se (moste deuout men) into what scoolyshe reasons (vnsemelye for our profession) we are wrapped, whyles we wyll answere thys Bysshop to euerye poynt?Uvho so hath any good thynge aboue other, yt hath he not but by ye peculier gifte of god wherewith those other are not indued.
            
            Yet wolde I, that Uvynchester wolde made answer to thys, whyles he contendeth that the gyfte of chastitie is geuen equally to all men, and that they which burne in the vnmaryed lyfe, and are destitute of thys gyfte are destitute of it by theyr owne ignauye and sluggyshenes. Howe commeth thys facultye and wyll to receaue and to vse thys offered gyft of chastitie to other, who lay

them selues or of God?A secte of heretiques, Yf he say of thē selues, he shall affirme with the Pelagianes, that a mā may haue some good thyng, which he receaueth not of gods free gyfte. But yf he saye of God, thē must he nedes graunt that they which burne not, and vpon that receaue the worde of chastitie promptlye and stedfastlye, haue receaued a gyfte from aboue, which is not geuen to suche as burne and therevpon refrayne not thē selues, how soeuer theyr ignauye and sluggyshnes be in the cause. And so let Uvynchester turne hym whiche waye he wyll, yet shal he eyther falle to the Pelagyans, or graunte that suche as make them selues chaste for the kyngdom of heauens sake, receaue a gyfte, which is not geuē to other, that refraine not themselues, but burne, & therefore are licensed to marye.

yea with the doctrine of dyuels, forbedding holye matrymonie, and gaensaynge the holye ghost, which sheweth euidentlye, that matrymonye is a holye thinge, and that they syn not which receaue it, but do well, and that such as burne shold marie, and therbye do better, then if they remayne vnmaried.
            In this point Uvinchester laiihe against me, that I dreame certayne vocacions in chastie,In hys fyrst Epistle D. i. &. ij and that I retayne with my selfe a sense in the worde of vocation, whiche is farr alyenat from the trenth of the catholike churche. As thought God had fayned to chastytye certaine bodies of mē,Bucer neuer spake nor writ no suche thynge therfore Uvynchester maketh a lye vpon hym. and thos by the moderation of humors, wherwith he shold be pleasyd and contēt to receaue this gift, that they shold retayne and kepe it without all striuing of nature and without al force. Thes he saith are my wordes.
            Trulye seing the holye ghost by his seruaunt Paule settheth Godlye matrymonie emonge Gods holye vocations, Christian men can not cast me in

the tethe, for gladly vsing this word. Uvhereby vnto god & our maker with a more ful confessyon I may referre all good thinges, who bringeth to effect al thinges in all men. Nother do I retayn wyth my selfe anye sense of this worde contrarye to the treuthe of the catolyke church. For thos thinges, concerning the moderation of humors, which should bringe to passe that suche as are indued with the gift of abstinēce sholde retaine and kepe this gift, against all stryfe and force of nature. Uvynchester hath brought furthe of his owne, and not of myne, for he neuer read thē in anie of my writtynges.

               But this (takinge for example the eternall worde of God, set forthe in the holye scryptures) I confesse not without cause, that God, who bringeth in all men all thinges to effecte by hys euerlastinge wisdome, reachinge mightylye from ende to ende, and guidinge all thinges plesently, lyke as he calleth his elect, beinge nothinge, to be somwath so calleth he them also to their being, and to thos thinges wherunto he hath destinid euerie man. And that

he fassyonithe thē to thes giftes assigned of hym to eche one, in theyr mothers wombe. And also that from the mothers womb, he seperateth them to him selfe, and that he maketh apt aud instructed them with the giftes both of bodie and minde to the selfe same offyces, that they may receaue them well and happilye to the glorie of his name and edifijng of his churche.
            Notwythstandinge God hath the heares of oure head numbred, and not one of them perissheth from our heade without his sure prouidens, and sholde he not then certainelye determine before, in whether kynde of lyfe euerie mā shold serue him, other in the state vnmaried or maried?
            Euerie wise workeman in his worke forcasteth and shapeneth all thinges to the ende, which is apointed in the same worke. And should we doubt that god (who alone shapeneth all our membres in ye darkenesse of our mothers wōbe) forechasteth and apointeth all partes and possibilities both of bodie and minde, to ye selfe same functiōs of life whervnto he hath chosen eche one before

the creation of the worlde.
            
               Dionisius Bisshope of corinth writ an Epistle to ye Guosians, wheryn he admonissheth & instanly exhorteth ther Bisshop Pinitus that he will not layd the brethren with the great burthēs of cōpultion to vowe chastitie for so he might chaunce to put ye ī firmite of manie in a hasarde.

Yet notwithstanding, bycause the holie ghoste him selfe willeth them that can not refraine to be copled in matrimonye, and declarethe openlye that this is better for such as burne: and willethe thos wemē that are in ieopardie of vnpure lyfe to marie, we affyrme hereof that the vocation of matrimonie sholde be obserued and proued, if anie fele him selfe to be in a hasarde by the reason of to feruent burning. yet not furthwithe. For we teache that first of al christes spirite must be called vpon, which is the guide vnto all veritie, and wherwith Gods chyldren are leade in all pointes. Afterward that counsayle must be demaunded of godlye and wyse men, and specyallye of suche vnto whom the Lorde

hath peculyerly committed the charge of them. Laste of all, that it must well be consyderyd by the same spyryte of Christe, what thos offyce and functiōs of lyfe be, wher vnto God hath called enerye man, and whether kynde of lyf chastitie or matrimony (in going about thos gyftes Godlye) is moste commedious & profytable, or incommedious & vnprofytable. For he is a very foole that consyderithe not Gods worke in other, but he is more foole that consyderith them not in hym self. Uhich the wyse men of the worlde knewe so, that they iudged them not without cause to stryue against God, which go about to applye them selues to other actions of lyfe,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . then they perceaue them selues to be borne and made vnto. Upon this ye holye fathers also, as it is to be sene by the places aboue rehersed, geueth them counsayll that will take vpon them the vnmaried state, fyrste of all deuoutly to examine them selues, and to knowe whether they haue receaued strengthe and giftes of God to this kinde of lyfe.
            
               Emonge all thes thinges, what is not taken owt of the holy letters, what is not agreable to the catholyke cōsent oft he holye fathers, what fynallye dothe not condescende to the trewe holines. And by this ye perceaue howe vngodly Uvinchesters quarellīg is,Uvinchesters notable quarelling. in that he layeth to vs, that we make such a gift of chastitie, whiche may now be properlye named n

               ther continence, nor abstynence, nor impotence, nor yet the vnaptnesse of the bodye to fylthye lustes. And that we make the tokens of thes gift, to be moued by no prickingges of nature to fylthye lustes: lyke as the tokens of the vocation to matrimonye, yf men (after they haue loste with riatousnes and excesse in carnall pleasures, the gift of chastitie) fele them selues to be inclyned to matrymonye. But where hathe he read thes thinges in anie of oure writtinges, or in what communication hath he euer harde thē of vs? Seinge therfor he hathe replenisshed his writinges with such manyfeste and open lyes, ye perceaue what credite a man should geue to their testimonies.

Uve folowing our onlye M. Iesus Christe in heauen,what ye gift of chastitie is called and of what effect it is name the gyft chastitie, abstinence for the kingdome of heauēs sake & a spirite of chastitie & vncorrupt holynesse, wherby they may that are indued therwithe, beinge fre from matrymony, cleaue so moche the more without seperation vnto God, and receaue so moche the sooner and stedfaster the holy ministeries and offyces, to the whiche matrymonie shold be a hinderance and impediment. As for impotence, and the vnfitnes of the bodye to fylthye lustes, are mete names for him, that maketh a sporte of such things, for the whiche the sonn of God was crucyfyed. So therfor we make not that, no man or some man feleth motion vnto fylthie lustes, or tokens of the offeryd gyft of chastye and matrimonie. But as I said, the counsayles of parentes, and of godlye and wyse men in Chryst,Signes of ye gift of chastitie. and the very functions of the lyfe offerid from aboue, & the Godlye affayres readie at hande, whiche in chastitie or matrimonie may cōmodiously be takē to gods glorie, & to

the furtherance of the church. Also the Godlye propentions and inclinations of mindes to eyther kinde of lyfe, & the facuties both of body & minde. Certainlye the vnmaried state of it selfe pleaseth not God, and they receaue the rewarde of the fooliysh virgines whiche take and kepe it not for the kingdome of heauens sake that is to say, that they may be the more readye, stedfaste, and frutfull to serue the lord in more large charges and duties, then the maryed lyfe can sustayne, and whose vtilitie extendeth farther. Thes tokens therfor wolde we haue suche to obserue, that make inquisytion whether they are called to the state vnmaried or no.burning is also a token of the vocation to matrymonie. But bycause (as I haue said) the holye gooste, the thefe teacher and distributer of trew holynes pronunceth euidentlye hym selfe that suche as burne, that is, (as Chrisostome expoundeth) such as sustaine moch force and burninge, and for that cause are in ieopardie of fallyng, shold put them selues out of such a dauniger be matrimonie. Uve cā not gain saye nor ought nor, yt they whiche

sustaine such force and burninge, and can not auoide it by prayers or trew mortifying of the fleshe, and also perceaue that they haue more occations offered vnto them to serue God accordinge to his preceptes in matrymonye then castitie, do wel and Godlye seing thes tokens declare their vocation to matrymonye.
            Now haue I sufficiently spoken concerning the fyrste place of our defense, wherin I purposed to proue, that certaine are so called and geuen from aboue to holye matrimony, and emonge them, not a fewe indued and geuen to the holye ministerye of the churches, that they sholde frustrat theyr laboure in praynge for the gift of chastitie, and should neuer lead this kinde of life godlye nor yet happily. The which things (most deuout men) I commit to yowr iudgement, and all other mens that wyll read and ponder godlye what the holye letters in all places both teache in preceptes and set furth in examples.of what principles▪ mā may decerue & iudge of ye present disputatiō.

            Now therfor wil we passe ouer to ā
               other place of oure present defense, and teache, that what so euer be in the offerid gift of chastitie geuē other to all mē indisserentlye (which Uvinchester will haue) or to certaine onlye, and men chosen from aboue for the same purpose, (which we haue proued and vanquisshed by the worde of God & authoritie of the holy fathers) And other place of this defense, what so euer be of ye gift of chastitie, yet y• this is against ye lawes of god and the churche, bycause ye abstinence from holy matrimony is required of al preestes and solytarye parsōs. Yet that this is cleane contrarye to the lawes of God, and of the church, & againste the authoritie of holye fathers, to require at this daye the foreswearinge of matrimony and abstaininge from the same, of all such as muste be admitted or are admitted into presthood or professyon of solytarines. Fyrst therfor I exhorte all mē that loue christes kingdom, & that desyre the comelynes of Gods howse, and the trew holines of preestes to be restored again, that it maye be Godly pondered what God him selfe (who alone konweth what gyft he hath geuen or will geue to euerye man, and what is more deceut and furtheraunce to the

prystlye lyfe teacheth and cōmaundeth concerning the mariage of prestes, in that he dothe it in two places by hys Apostle Paul, & in thos places wher as he speaketh euidentlye of the holynes and vertues of preestes, that a prest should be the husbande of one wife, & a good instruct
                  •
               r of his children, Thys doth he set to be the chefe of thos vertues which he requireth in a Bisshop & other ministers.
            Then do I desyre them to confert Godlye with this holy precept, ye lawe of ye romish seate (whose defense Uvinchester hath taken vpon him) wherbye no man be he neuer so holy in all his tyme, or furnisshed with all giftes of the holy ghost to the ministerye of the holye church is admitted in to the order of prestes, without he vowe him selfe to be the husbande of no wife & is put besyde his presthod, who so euer marieth a wife therin, and then let them iudge whether this lawe of the pope of Rome, be not cleane contrarye to the lawe of God? For God as well in the order of preestes as of Bisshops doth

both require, and also plainlye admyt, a maried mā. But the pope of Rome 
                  •
               oth nother admitt a maried man in to this order, nor yet bye any meanes sufferith him therin. Let Uvinchester therfor expounde vnto vs, how the pope of Rome, an erthly God, therin speaketh not cleane contrarye to the heauenlye, and trewe God?
            Here yf Uvinchester flie to the authoritye of thos fathers which wolde haue this precept of God so to be vnderstanded, that therbye they should be excluded from presthoode, which haue more wyues then owne, and yet they should not be admitted to presthod whiche haue one, and will kepe her in the vse of matrimonye, and laye againste vs the church of Egipt, of the chaste, & of the apostolycall seate, which now in S. Hierōs tyme were wont to receaue for prestes none, except they wer other no maried men, or els had resigned it. Uve again laye vnto him. Fyrst the saing of the holye ghost, in the whiche is not one worde wherbye may be gathered, that he onlye should be admitted

to presthood which was, and is not the husbande of one wife. Further more Uvinchester is not ignorant, that no lawe, necessarye for oure helthe, can be apointed by the authoritie of holye fathers. Also he can not denye that S. Chrisostoms authoritie and others yt make with vs, sholde be anie lesse sett bye, then the authoritie of his holye fathers, yea theirs sholde be so moche the more sett by, as their interpretation is more agreable with the wordes of the holy ghooste. But they vnderstoode & expounded this saing (the husbande of one wife) in the same meaning as we, & tawght plainelye that the holye ghoste by this precept, that a Bisshope shold be the husband of one wife) wold commē
               de the dignitie of matrimonye, and condemne before thos heretiques, whiche blasphemed that there was some vnpurenes in matrimonye, & that bicawse he teachethe in this place, that matrimonye is such a holy thing and honeste, yt therwith a man may ascende, yeuen vnto ye holye throne, that is to say, the seat of a Bisshoppe. In fine Uvinchester knoweth also this, yt S. Chrisostoms

interpretation, & others making with vs, is reiected of none of the holye fathers, that it shold not be counted to be of the right opinion, no truly not of S. Hierom, who notwithstāding alleaged it in expoundinge this place. Let winchester therfor now declare, by what authoritie ye romisshe seate prohibiteth to followe S. Chrisostoms opinion, & other fathers that agre wyth vs, and constraineth (leauinge this as erronious) to followe the interpretatiō of S. hierom, and such other that make with him. Let hym shewe, whye it is thrust furth vnto vs for a catholik law which was neuer catholike, no not by thos fathers yt alowe it.1. Tim. 3. Act. i. Furthermor Uvīchester knoweth that the holye fathers made fyrme with manie lawes, and that with the lawes of God, that no man, what so euer he be, sholde be admitted in to anie degree of the Cleargie, or els if anie be admitted, shold be sufferid to remaine therin, if he be foūde to haue liued or do lyue, of anie likelihood, with impuritie & vncleannes of life: moch lesse if he be founde to liue dishonestly in

the face of the worlde. And so therfor let him make answere, what spirite the Romains folowe, and suche as make with them, whē they exalt to the chefe orders of holye ministerye, and suffer therin to remain, & that now such a lōg continuance of tyme, them that lyue wt open dishonestie. Let him also shewe what spirite shold be thanked for this, that they not contented to caste from holye ministeries, but besydes that punishe cruellye prestes that marie wiues, against diuerse lawes, & thos apoī
               ted by mā, lyue they neuer so Godly & holyly, and be they neuer so studious & apt to edifie Gods churche. And in yt mean season prestes and Bisshops implicated in manifest hore huntinges, defyllinges of virgines, adulterie, and other greather myschewes, and which newer came to the perfect knowledge of anie parte of the pastorall mynystery, & moch lesse purposed by al meanes to go about it, they do not onlye leue vnponisshed, but also eft sones adorne them with the chefe and highest degres of ye ecclesiastical dignitie & powr.
            
               Besides this Uvynchester knoweth also that all the fathers acknowleged that chastitie,Chastitie yf it be not taken yt thou mayest haue the more leser 
                     •
                  o godlye dedes & ministeryes, is abominable to God. thowghe it be purelie kept for as much as pertayneth to the bodie, yet that the hypochrysye of it is abominable before God, yf it be not taken and kepte for thys intent, that euery man maye cleaue so moche the more without separatyon vnto God, and exhibite hys mynysterye vnto hym the more perfectely to the edifyenge of the churche. It is knowen vnto hym well ynoughe, as I suppose, yt Saynte Chrysostome writteth vpon thys place of Saynte Paule. (Thys do I saye for your profitte, not that I shoulde tangle you in a snare, but for that which is honeste and comely vnto you, and whiche herevnto conduceth, that ye maye perfectely, and without separation sticke vnto the Lorde) that she is nother virgyn, nor yet honeste, whiche is wrapt, and tyed faste in the cares of the worlde. For the Apostle when he said, that a woman and a virgyn are separated, in so saynge he sette the difference betwext them, that is to

saye, because the one taketh care for the thynges of the worlde, and the other for the thynges of God, and gaue a definition of a virgyn, not maringe nor continence, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                other to be deliuered from the cares of the worlde,The holy fathers had rather haue had shepeherdes maryed mē geuē to holy thī
                  ges, then vnmaryed, implicated in the cares of ye worlde. or to be wrapped in them: Uvherfore the holye fathers made neuer so moche of chastitie, for all they counted it of great valu, but that they supposed maryed men shoulde rather haue the gouernaunce ouer the churches, which setting a part a worldly busines, shoulde be more geuen to heauenly cares? then virgynes and vnmaryed, whiche shoulde be slacker in the trewe studye of religyon. Uvherof S. Hierom writ these thīges agaynst Iouinianus. And howe commeth it to passe (ye will say) that the vnmaryed eft sones in ye prestlye ordinaunce is not regarded, and the maryed chosen? Because purchaunce he hath no other workes agreable to hys vnmaryed state. Or els is thought to be chaste and is not, or elles hys chastytye is slaunderous, or els

at the least wyse by hys chastitie he waxeth hye mynded, and whyles he standeth in hys owne concept of the onelye chastitie of the bodye he neglecteth other vertewes: Nouryssheth not the poore, is greadye of money: these are hys wordes. Beholde thys man of God graunteth worthilye to be secluded from holy ministerye, not them all onely whose virginite is fayned, slaunderous and suspicious: but they also whose virginite wanteth other vertues and workes correspondent to virginite: whiche nouryshe not the poore, whiche are couetous or gready of money.
            Here let Wynchester make answer by what face or audacitie,That whiche shoulde be chiefly saught for in the chastitye of preestes the abstinence frō ye busynes of the worlde is cleane neglected of the Romanes. the Romysh seat and suche as make with it, may in thys cause brynge forthe agaynste vs the authoritie of holy fathers, whiche requyre not of theyr preestes so moch as the chastitie of the bodye, and moch lesse suche a chastitie, whiche (al worldly cares set a parte) shoulde be onelye geuen to Heauenlye thynges, by suche seueritie and such cruelnes,

as they make diligente searche that no man haue a leaful wyfe? And here lett Uvynchester also examyne hys lyfe, hys dedes, and hys Episcopalle gouernaunce, and acknowelege hym self, how farre wyde he had declared hym, to be from suche an one as the holy fathers confesse to be onely a Christian, moche wyder from the chastitie that ought to be in a preeste. And that fyrst of all performe in hym selfe: then requyre and put it from other, whether they be of the Cleargye or of the Laytye, which at some tyme were fruetful vnto hym.How vacant Wynchester is from the cares of the worlde I call not here to remembraunce how he refused or tooke vpon hym worldlye busynes, and functions whiche pertayned not to a Bysshope: howe he diminysshed or increaced the pōpious court in his familie. Let him be his owne accuser and iudge: but accordinge to the lawes of God and the churche. In verie dede I chatter not furthe as he reproued me in his last epistle (yf he haue done his prince anie seruice to the weale publike, and edifiinge of the church: For I knowe what

ambasages S: Ambrose hath gone for his rulars: and busines S: Gregorye hath done for the Romanes. And what other moste holye fathers tooke vpō them at the present necessities of their princes, and of Christes people, & for the commune weale and tranquilitie? But for all that what a crosse it was to them to be absent the space of one houre from their proper ministeries, they haue witnessid in verie deed: and not in wordes onelye.
            But Uvynchester doubteth not of thys also,The old auncient iudged it a mad thynge yf the churches had bē soner ministred by no pastores or els very ill vnmaryed, that emonge al the olde antiquitie of the church it hath ben counted a madde thynge, yf any had rather the churches shoulde be destitute of all pastorall cure, or destroyed by manyfest wicked shepeherdes: then to be ministrede Godlie & helthsomlie, by godlie & apt ministers, thowghe they were maried.
            Epiphanius writethe that when in his tyme the lawes were purelie obserued, ther were none taken in to the order of elders, deacons, or subdeacōs but they that wer eyther withowt a

wyfe, or els had refrayned thē selues frō their wyfe: yet doth he graunt that at the same tyme in certaine places, the custome was to chose thos, that as yet begat childrē in to this order. And writeth that the cause therof was emōge some of the multitude of churches that wanted ministers, and the lacke of verie chaste men, which notwithstāding shold haue byne instructed in other necessarye gyftes also of holie ministery emonge other the fainte obseruation of the lawe,Epiphaniꝰ was in opinyon, that wheras wante mete ministers, there shoulde maryed mē haue the gouernaū
                  ce ouer ye Churches wt good ryghte and the proper minde of tho
                  •
                churches & bisshopes wich receaued in to the higher orders of holye ministery, such that as yet, begat children. For all that, this man of God is not in opinion that thos churches, or bisshops shal be excluded from the ecclesiastical cōmunion, or that thei sholde be barred from this libertye.
            It appeareth also ye S▪ Hierom was in the same opinion. wherfore Epiph. reputethe it not vnto them for anie reproche, which receaued maried men in to the order of preestes driuen by the want of vnmaried ministers, whiche

had ben apte to feade the Lordes shepe. For he acknowleged to be farre better to haue apte shepeherdes of the people, thoughe they be maryed men, then none and vnapte.Epiphanius and Hierom coūt not thē flagitious, whiche by no necessitie made maryed men the gouernars ouer the Churches. Albeit he iudged them, whiche dyd it, other by the wante and imperfection of more seuere or sharpe disciplyne, or els because they supposed it to be more fyt and cō
               modyous, to haue declyned by so doynge from the receaued discyplyne of the churche, yet dothe he not count thē scismatyques, nor writte oughte vehementer agaynst thē. He noteth them onelye to make a certayne declination from the more syncere discyplyne.
            He that shall nowe reade withe a good zeale and depelye consyder these thynges, whiche the holye fathers haue lefte in writynges, partely concernynge the relygyon of holy ministery, & the holynes of ministers, & par
                  •
               ly also concerninge chastitie. He shal neuer stande in doubte, that those verye holye fathers, thowghe they praysed

the vnmaryed lyfe.The holy fathers wold at thys day cast forth the vnmaryed yt take the cure euer the churches: and wold set maryed men in theyr place. Yf they were now present, and sawe those vnmaryed mē, which now many yeares haue had the gouernaunce ouer the churches, wold by all meanes exhorte that, by admitting maryage of prestes. Yet some regarde of godlynes, & disciplyne might be renued in thys order, and that (settynge a syde those vnmaryed men, whiche nowe destroye the churches so miserablye) maried men, yf they were indued with anye godlynes, and knowelege and cure of Christes kyngdome, shoulde verye sone be receaued to take the cure of the churches. And maryed men (yf they be godlye, & instructed to Christes kingedome, and of a good iudgement) maye edifye Gods churches: whereas vngodly men, and suche as haue nother the studye nor intelligens of Christes kyngdome, may rather destroye the churches, then edifye them: Though they be more chaste then stones. They are vngodlye and without all knoweledge and studye of Christ, whosoeuer persiste in theyr manyfest mischeues. ¶Here therfore let

Uvynchester answere what authority of the olde auncyent, the Bysshops of Rome with theyr adherentes folowe,The old fathers suffered the churches to be ministred by laye mē and that in theyr presens. for so moche as now of late they haue sufferid Christes people not onlie to be robbed of all apte and mete shepeherdes (which how great a damnage it is, ye most deuout men, now perceaue & fele, whiles ye go about to repaire emonge yow the ecclesiastical busines) but also to be dissipated and oppressed in the steade of shepherdes, withe so manie reproches of men, & to be without all Christian religion: and that at this daye they had rather all christian religion, sholde go to wracke, then to suffer suche afflicte & decaide churches to be ministred by maried mē, that are godlie and instructed to Gods kindome.
                  The old Bysshops receaued both the lay men and also husban
                        •
                      men, & prefarred thē before them selues to teach ye people when they founde thē more mete thervnto then themselues.

                Moreower auntient trewe bisshops receaued to teache thei people in their presens lay men, and thos also maried: wheras they founde them to be more apt for this office then themselues. But our bisshops (which in thē selues and theirs no lesse contēne the authoritie of the olde auntient then

obiect it odiouslie against vs (before they wil licēse maried men, be they neuer so holie and apt to teache Christe to bestowe the talentes they haue receaued of the lorde in feadinge the lordes flockes, suffer rather that the lordes flockes want not onlie the pastores of euerlastinge lyfe? but also be scattred abroad, torne, and lost by manifest theues & robbars, that is to say. suche as come vp some other waye, & fede thē selues, For how many deuout mē, and such as were called of the lorde him selfe to feade Christes people, haue byne dryuē from this ministery, by this forbeddinge of matrimonie, y• greatlie to be bewayled wāt of good pastores declarethe more thē so moch, And this seing Uvynchester perceaueth sufficiently, why doth he not suppose & thinck yt therin the authoritie of the olde auncient sholde be folowe, to thentent he sholde iudge that princes & bisshops owght most especiallye to regarde thys, that Christes doctryne, and discyplyne maye therebye be purelye and faythfully ministred to his

people: and that they sholde admitt to this office, whome so euer it appeared were made and instructed of the Lorde therevnto: and therfore also called: whether they lyue holilye and godlye in matrimonye or chastitie: seynge that the trew chastitie whiche the holye fathers sowghte for in the ministers of the churches, and whiche alone is acceptable before GOD, hathe a good whyle a go ben lefte of to be searched for: and that whiche is accustomed to be searched for, hathe brought suche a great stynkynge puddle of impuritie into the order of preestes. For that the Churches shoulde haue very holye and profytable preestes. Uve knowe it muste nedes be profytable to all mens helthe. But that preestes shoulde onelye be withoute lefull wyues, whome I pray you dothe it profyt a pynne:No constrained vowes please God. yet what a ruyne and decay it hathe ben and is to the churches, who can expresse it, as it shoulde be? Fynallye thys is also manyfest vnto Uvinchester, yt a vowe

can not be acceptable before GOD,Uvhat vowes are acceptable to God without it be taken by the faythe of hys worde and be of power to sanctifye hys name. And he knoweth howe vncircumspectlye, and constraynedlye and howe many tymes vngodly vowes are made of diuers preestes, and monastical parsons, whiche emonge a thousande, truelye scarse one hath in mynde to kepe, especyally godlye, to saye, to serue God therebye, and to execute the ministerye of the church so moche the more holye and fru

               tfully. Uvhiche they all declare to grosselye, who are by no externall compultyon restraynt, and had rather take vpon them any labours or paynes, then those that properlye pertayne to the monasticall and priestlye order.
            
               Howe gentlye God & ye holye fathers remytted rash vowes.To be short Uvynchester knoweth thys also with what clemencye God hym selfe and the holye fathers remitted them the vowe of chastitie, that obserued it euell. The holy ghooste planelye commaunded the yonger wemē to marye, which had broken theyr first

promyse, after they were in ieopardy of vncleannes and euell reporte. These, seynge they are Gods wordes, bothe belonge vnto all, that fynde themselues in that ieopardye, that is here expressed, and also are greater then all the exception of mans vowe or decre. Saynte Cyprian perceauynge thys,Ciprianus. writte concernynge the vyrgynes, which professed chastitye, and that not of hys owne opinyon onlye, but also of certayn that were of the same order, yea and of the whole churche to. Yf they wyll not continewe, or can not, it is better for them to mary, then to falle into the fyre, by theyr deliciousnes: Truely they shoulde offende nother bretherne,Epiphanius. It is better in takynge a wyfe after the vowe, & to fall in to iudgement. then in nor systerne. So Saynt Epiphanius declareth also that it is better for hym that leaueth the iournaye, and vowe of chastitie to marie a wyfe openly agreable with the lawe, and so to fall 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . that is, as he him selfe interpreteth it, into the iudgemente of repentaunce done for a season, whiche fynysshed, he maye be brought into the churche agayne, then

vnder the dissimulation of chastitie, to be dayelye wounded with priuye dartes, and so for fornication to falle 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is, into condemnation, wherebye suche are cleane expelled out of Christes kyngedome.

And the great assemble at Calcedonia licensed expressedly Bysshoppes to remit the vowe of chastitie. Also Galatyus the Pope left the wemen, that maryed after they professed and vowed chastitie to God, to theyr owne conscience.
            ¶Here therfore let Wynchester answere fro whens he and hys fellowes haue so moche the more seueritie and cruelnesse graunted them to make inquisition for vowes, then those holye fathers had? But what saye I? to make inquisition for vowes? To seeke, I

shoulde haue saide, that no man after he ha
                  •
               he vowed chastitie be lefullye maried. For that the vowes of holye Chastitie shoulde excell: that is to say: that they who so haue made suche vowes, shoulde cleaue so moch the more without seperation vnto God, and serue the churche more fruetefullye, who maketh inquisition? Nother may that fayned matter concernynge the symple and solemne vowe make anye thynge agaynste thys. For the religyon of all vowes made vnto GOD is equalle, so that the godly shoulde obserue it, yf it agre with the lawe of God: and forsake it, yf it disagre to the worde of God. It is also euydente ynough, that no greater thyng can be in suche vowes, as the authoures of that fayned matter make solemne, then is in the other, whiche the holye fathers (whose opinions I haue alledged) thought best to be remitted and broken: For with these vowes men haue consecrated themselues vnto God, as it is the chiefest thynge requyred in euerye godly vowe.
            
               Thes thinges let Uvynchesters waye, and depelie consyder, and yf he cā, shew that it is not here made plain, that the same lawe (whose defense he hathe taken vpon him) whiche forbiddethe al that are ons receaued or must be receaued in to the order of prestes or salitarie lyfe, to marye, cā not onlie be defended by no authoritie o
                  •
                Christes churche or holye fathers, but also is cleane cōtrarye both to Gods very lawe, and also to the trewe and catholike Canons of Gods holye churche, and to the wholl consent of all the holye and right opinionid fathers.
            Herin therfor let Uvynchester do the office of a bisshop, & shewe (yf he cā) by trewe argumentes that we are in an erroure, and cease to depraue by suche triflinge and vngodlie tawntes the dyuine and holie fathers sentenses. and to peruerte and mistake with his rayling sophistrie, owre confessiō settforthe plainelie and holilie, & to scrape to gether withe moche a do (wynking at oure perfecte & sounde argumētes here and there a worde by his scoffinges

& to boaste an derake hym selfe in doubtfull places, wherin the cause cōsisteth not, leapinge ouer to fauorablie & gently the trewe foundations of oure confessyon, and the moste clere testimonies of the holy scriptures.
            For thes thinges are farr vnsemelye, not onlye for a Bisshope, but for an other man, with that currishe and doggishe eloquence, wherof he coulde in thes his writinges against me, make nother measure nor ende.
            And this I suppose be suffycyentlye spoken concerninge the seconde place of oure defense. Uvherin I tooke vpō me to teache, that the aucthoritie of the holye fathers is cleane contrarye both to the lawe of God, and also of his church: for so moche as they require and compell all that are, or must be admitted to preesthod or monasticall lyfe to forsweare, and to abstain from holye matrimonie.
            Now let vs make answere to the lye whiche Uvinchester falselye and wrongefullye laythe to my charge, wherof I entended to speake in some certain

place Uvinchester denieth that ye same fained matter, concerning the necessite wherbye ye father shold be constrained to geue his doughter in mariage, by ye reason of his smale substāce, came into his braine, which I affirmed vnto Latomus, I harde of him in oure communication together.

doth he affirme thesame. Who therfor shalbe the iudge betwext vs? He despaireth of witnesse and writeth that I receaue no witnesse / but such as are conspired: whom I should call Godlye men / and worthie credit. And therfor he requireth witnesse of the marter it selfe: And as Sophocles purged him selfe of dotage by the settinge furth of the tragedie he had at the same time in hande: So doth he demaūde of the rightous good reader whether it be likelie that he answered me at anie time such foolishe thinges / so vnsauerie / and so farr alienat from all knowleg of scriptures / seing he wrate thos thinges / that I shold kepe secrete / and suche thinges again as he publisshed abroad against me the second time: For he wold haue thes his writinges to seme to haue some affinitie with the knowledge of holie scripture / & with the quicnesse of iudgement / so that it should be rekened incredible that he answered me anie thinge so foolish / and vnworthie for him that hath taken vpon him to entreat of diuinitie / thes thinges doth he writ in his laste epistle against me.
            
            In verie dede I wyll with all my hart admit,Uve admit gladlye anye mete witnesse. to geue sentence of oure communication, anie whose iudgemēt and sentense in suche a cause owght and may haue anie waight. Nother do I knowe anie conspired, without he meane suche as haue holylye and Godly sworne, as I haue done, to christe, and vnto their prynces and magistrates. Also I esteme them Godlye

and worthie credit, yt may be knowen to be suche by theyr fructes of godlynes. Suche therfor whether they pertaine to his householde, or are peculierlye ioyned to me in the lorde, may declare & witnesse, what so euer they remembre of oure communication.
            Nother do I refuse the testimonies of his owne writtinges, but a me contented therof to iudge, both how trew Uvinchester is in alleaging oure sainges, and how sure and trustie in interpretinge Gods scriptures.Uvinchester complaineth ye Bucer keapeth close his writing and yet he setteth it not forth in print hī selfe. He reproued me, bicause I kepe secrete his writinge: but if he suppose that his cause hath therby anie with the more furtherance, whye did not he him selfe longe a go put them forthe? For he affyrmed that he hath with him his owne hande writtinge. Trulye I thought it euer best to reserue it to myne answere as now euerie day the matter it selfe wyll declare. But at this present tyme, seinge I haue nother tyme ne place to set owt all that, I will shewe as moche therof as is requisyte for this present cause, and that wyll I compare with

hys writinges imprinted, to thentent all men maye se what credite his writinges deserue, & how they shold be estemed. For yf so be the lawe of witnesse be commune to vs both, that theyr testimonies may not be receaued whiche speake contrarye to themselues. Winchesters owne writinges shall conuince him selfe of vanitie and quarellinge, and not me.
            For in his writing which after oure communication he sent vnto me, when he had gone about to proue that this place of Paule (But if anye thinke it vncomelye for his virgine if she passe the tyme of mariage) should be vnderstanded of the virgin now affyaunced, and whose tyme is past, when the father promised to geue her to a husbande. He writ thus.
            But (saith Paule) that father being of a fyrme and stedfaste minde to kepe his doughter a virgin nothinge wauering and which as yet hath in his handes to apointe with him selfe to marye her or to kepe her chaste.Uvinchesters wordes owt of hys hād writīge. Also the whiche is constrainid by no necessytie that

rise the eyther of that, that he can not easelie finde her a husbande, eyther is alleaged, by the reason of the cōuenantes that are to be obserued, is compelled to marye his doughter: but hathe the power ouer his owne will so, that as yet he maye chose whether he will geue her to matrimonye or no. Finallye hathe decreed withe the sure decree of his minde to kepe his virgin, this father, I saye, by Paules iudgement, whiche keapeth his virgin by the perpetual stedfastnes of his minde as cō
               secrated and dedicated vnto God, doth a dede whiche profiteth not onlie the virgin, as he said before, but also the father him self before God, And therfor saithe Paul, he dothe wel. And this is Paules proper meanīg, thus moch hathe he writtē, whiche he maye know by his hande writing that he hath kept withe him,
            Trulie in thes wordes is not expressidlie set that interpretation, which Winchester brought in oure communication together, concerninge the necessitie to marie ye doughter, for ye pe

            I wyll continewe on to shewe how manye wayes his writinges disagre to thē selues, and euerte one an other. Uvherof that shal not only be manifeste, how he with his owne with witnesse shalbe conuinced of falshoode, but also it shalbe knowen that it is no maruayle, if he changed afterwarde in writinge that in oure disputation he spake vnaduisidlie, seinge he reuoked afterwarde thos thinges whiche he writt with great deliberation, and that not onlye in his other, but also in the selfesame writinge, and that openlye publysshed abroade.
            Understande ye therfore of thys thinges, which I haue brought owt of his owne hand writinge. Fyrste howe Uvynchester interpreted this sainge of Paule (and hath no nede) not onelye out of hande,Wintonien adsertor stoicus. and without puttinge anie doubt, and in one simple meaning▪ but also that he added vnto this his interpretation an assured affyrmans. For this is (saith he) Paules proper meaninge,

Afterwarde, that he hath interpreted this place of the necessitie to marie the doughter, and not to kepe her. Last of alle concerninge the necess

            Now with thes thinges conferr that he writ against me in his fyrst epistle which he publisshed abroade. For therin he accuseth me of vngodlye audacitie, bycause I brought of this place of Paule, whiche is harde and of an vncertaine sense, one sense & that certaine, which he wil not presume vpon him to do.Uvinchester is an vncertan sceptical coniectu

            And to make men to haue a farther opinion of this my ignoraunce and arrogantye, he subscrybeth greke glo

are asscribed vnto one Photius & Oecmenius, nother auncient interpreters, nor yet of anie approued authoritie. And whiche both interprete this place (And hath no ned) not to marye, but to kepe the vyrgyn. And toughe the one of them, Photius writeth that this palce may as properlye be vnderstanded of the necessytye to marye the doughter. Yet doth he meane the same necessytie that we whiche shold come of the condition and wyll of the doughter, and not that whiche Uvinchester hath fained, that it shold eyther ryse of the diffycultie to get her a husband, eyther be alleaged by the conueuantes of mariage.
            Furthermore this same interpretation of Photius, concerninge the necessytie to kepe the doughter whyche he graunteth to be longe no lesse properlye to this place of Paule, then the other he spake of before. Uvinchester in his hande wrytynge sent vnto me, and in the same also he hath imprinted, oppugnethe and ouerthrowethe

with all his myght and with his moste presumptious scoldinges, namynge it colde, foulysh, tryflynge, and not agreable wyth Paules wordes, but cleane contrarye vnto them, wherof sone after I wyll speake more.
            To be short, besydes this, that he oppugneth so greatlye, and so shamefullye rebuketh this interpretation, no more owrs and Photius ys. Then all the olde very holy fathers, he laith also againste vs, that in this behalfe, we bringe in oure owne fayninges, and prefarr them before the interpretation of the olde auncient antiquitie.

hys doughter a virgyn, as he hath rather necessitie to marye her. There Uvynchester denyed that the father hathe necessitie to marye hys doughter, of the doughter her selfe, and then he cam in, withe hys fayned matter, concernynge the tenuite and smalle portyon of substaunce, whiche somtyme constrayneth parentes to marye theyr dowghters. But I stooke in thys vndoubted pryncyple of holye scripture, that the father

                haue no power to kepe hys doughter, excepte he perceaue it to be for her profyt. Yf he feareth that it wyll chaunce otherwyse, that he hathe nede to marye her, ouer whome he hathe the gouernaunce in steade of her GOD, that trewe father, as farre as her profitte extendeth.
            Thys when Wynchester had belyke wayed more exactely with him self, he sent a wrytynge vnto me, wherein he interpreted thys clause, (And hathe no nede) as before I recyted

hys wordes of the necessitie to marye the dowghter, whiche eyther riseth of that, that he can not easely fynde her a husbande, eyther that is alleaged by the couenauntes of wedlock. Uvherin before thys he brought also this glose, that Paul in thys place answereth of the virgyn nowe betrothed by the father, & not cleane fre Uvherof he spake not a worde in oure communication together lyke as he hath fayned it of hym selfe alone without anye author. In thys behalfe Uvynchester writeth that I answered hym beynge trobled in mynde with moche stammerynge & stutrynge, and therfore had great maruayll at me. But coniecture you your selues (most worthy people) what troble or stammerynge myghte let me in thys behalfe to answer Uvynchester. For what thynges in our communication came into hys mynde and mouth, ye maye easelye coniecture, for so moch as he clothed them afterwarde withe wrytynges depely purposed for. The whiche nowe after what sorte they are and howe groundlye Uvynchester

hathe proued them, let vs marke diligentlye.
            First he castethe in ower tethe that of this oure interpretatiō, of ye necessitie to marye the dowghter (which the father is constrayned to do, yf he perceaue that his dowghter is called and geuen to mariage, and not to chastitie) we be the onlie authores, and that it is oure inuētion and fayninge.
            Secondarily that it is very foolesh, absurde, and nothinge agreable withe the Apostles▪ wordes, 
                  〈…〉
                contrarye to them, In fine that it is suche an interpretation which yf it take place it must nedes be graunted yt Paule vsed an obscure wrappynge together of wordes, and nothynge pertaynyng to the matter he wolde entreat of, and that he caste forthe or

               abled wordes in vayne, and without sense.
            Thys doth Uvynchester lay agaīst oure interpretation in hys fyrste imprinted writynge against me. The latter two obiections he goith aboute to proue, but with what argumentes we shall se hereafter. Fyrste he counteth

it sufficient, that he hathe onely made obiection agaynst vs, saynge he alleaged the gloses of Photius and Oecomenius whiche haue interpreted thys clawse (and hathe no nede) otherwyse For all that Photius, as I afore sayd, alleaged oure interpretation, and declareth it to belonge no lesse properlye to thys place of Paule, as soone after we will shewe.
            But that the vanitie of Uvynchesters fyrst obiection, may more playnelye manyfeste it selfe, wherewith he laythe agaynste vs, that the same interpretation, whiche we alleaged here is oure owne inuention and faynynge, we thynke conuenyent to bringe forthe of thys owre interpretatyon not the authores (for the verye author therof is the holy ghooste, of whose wordes we gathered it) but the mete & ayte witnesses of the old auntient antiquitie of the church, whiche folowinge the same authore gaue the self same interpretation also vpon Saynt Paules wordes.
            
               S. Ambrose.Saynt Ambrose therfore vpon this

(Yf any man thinke it vncomelye for his virgyn, yf she passe the tyme of mariage, &c.) for so he interpreted this place of Paule, after he had spoken diuerse thynges before his interpretation, after other thynges writ thus also. Yf therfore anye virgyn be in desyre of mariage, now rype for a man, the Apostle teacheth here that it is better she marye openly agreable with the lawe, then priuately do it dishonestlye, and so turne to her shame. And vpon these the Apostles wordes (neuerthelesse he that hathe stedfa
                  •••
               y appoynted in his harte, and hath no nede &c.) he writ so. This he sayth, that who so hath a virgyn, whiche hathe no mynde to mary, shoulde kepe her: and not lay vnto her the playster of matrimonye, whome he perceaueth hathe no mynde to marye.
            Truely in these expositiōs ye se clerely howe S. Ambrose also ment that the Apostle wolde here teache, that it is the offyce of a good and GODlye father to consyder the disposition and wyll of hys doughter: and yf he

perceaue her to haue a desire to mary, to know yt he hath no powr to kepe her but hathe rather nede to se her maryed and so behouethe it to be done, least the doughter haue therebye occasyon to fall. But yf he se that hys doughter hath no mynde to marye, that he shoulde then kepe her, and in no wyse laye the plaister of mariage vnto her, but minyster all necessaryes accordynglye, wherebye she may kepe her virginite to Christe oure Lorde. And in thys commentaryes which are asserybed to S. Hierom, we reade, vpon this (And so ought it to be done) yf it shall so be requysite for the doughters wyl: For the parentes ought to kepe her, vntyl she come to her leful age, and to instrucie her to the better. But yf she wyl not, let that be done whiche muste nedes. And vpon thys (notwithstandynge he that hathe stedfastlye apoynted in hys harte &c.) he hath stedfastly apoynted, whose virgines agremente establyssheth the wyl of the father: and the necessitie of the doughter cōpelleth hym not to do, that she wolde. And

therfor it is playne, that this same interpreter sawe the same thynge in the Apostles wordes that we do. To say, that the pore to kepe and necessitie to marye the virgin consisteth in the condition and will of the virgyn.
            The self same thynge vpon these wordes of Paul, and in a maner in the same wordes dyd saynte Primasyus the Bysshop of Utica and disciple of Saynt Austyne writte.S. Primasius. For thys (and so oughte it to be done) he interpreted on thys sorte.Necessitie for ye wyl of ye mayden So must it nedes be for the necessitie of the damsell. And this. (He that hath stedfastly appoynted in hys harte) He hath stedfastly appoynted▪ whose wyll is establysshed by the wyll and mynde of the doughter.He byddeth euery man to take counsail of hys fleshe what he can sustayne. The same also he writteth in thys place. Yf euery man confer this matter withe hys flesshe, and seeth that he can not kepe hys virginite, let hym marye, lest in playinge the adulterer he dishonest hym selfe.
            In lyke maner concerning the doughter, yf she wyll, let that be done whi he muste nedes.
            
               
               The latter interpreters agre also.In the same meanynge dyd Thomas Aquinas, and the ordinarye glose, and Nycolas Lyranus expound these the Apostles wordes: and Erasmus Roterodamus, who in the interpretation of the same place a
                  •
               ded this also. That mariage is a lefull thynge, honeste, and for some necessarye.
            Nowe let vs marke Photius his other interpretation vpon thys same place of Paule, whome Uvynchester hathe brought forthe agaynste me, as a chiefe witnesse of the olde antiquitie. He added thys, after hys fyrste interpretation, concernynge the necessitie to kepe the virgyn.
            Notwithstandynge this sentense (And hathe no nede) may be otherwyse taken, and no lesse properlye, that he hathe no nede to do the contrarye to hys doughters wyll. For yf he se the disposition of hys doughter to be so that he muste nedes geue her to mariage, he ought not to kepe her a virgin: and so compell her to do the contrarye agaynste her inclination and wyl. For

virginitie is a thynge vuluntarye and not vnuoluntary. For yf she be kept a virgyn agaynste her will, and enclyneth to the euill parte, she excuseth her self, and laythe the cause of her fall vpon hym that constrayned her to kepe her virginite. This sayth Photius.
            Here I beseche you, what one thing of all those thynges, whiche I haue written aboute thys place, do ye 
                  •
               ot se expressed? Dothe not thys interpreter also euidently witnesse, that to haue no nede, is as moche, as the father is not constrained by his doughter to marye her? And that the father oughte to make diligent inquisitiō for those thinges, yt are in hys doughter, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is the disposition of her nature and inclination of her mynde: and not agaynst her mynde to kepe her a virgin.
            But when Uvynchester forcaste with hym selfe at the fyrste dashe, that I wolde obiecte thys vnto hym preuentynge my obiection writteth, that he graunteth howe Photius

iudgement is that a man shoulde not kepe his virgin against her will. But by what meanes (saith he)? bicause she is not called? No, not so. But, bissope, what is this to your purpos
                  •
               ? Though for all that, when Photius commaundethe to consider suche thinges as pertaine to the dowgther the disposition of her nature & inclinatiō of her mind, trulie he willethe to haue a respecte in the virgin bothe vnto her gyft, & also vnto her vocation: as it is manifeste. Inoughe by the forsainges, & herafter I will make it more plaine. But that Uvynchester cōtended in oure cōmunication,Uvynchester wil haue that the father may tangle hys doughter in ye snare of virginitye. was this: Seinge the father hathe right by this place of Paul to kepe his virgin agaynst her will, and to tangle her in the snare of virginitie whiche Paul wolde not do (For thes are his wordes, in his hande writinge vnto me) It is also in the princes hāde to tangle anie of his subiectes whō he will, be they neuer so lothe, in the snare of chastitie. Doth not Photius such and olde and laudable interpreter of Paul (in wynchesters opiniō) planilie

speake againste this fained glose? For he sheweth very plainlye how the Apostle teacheth here that the father ought not to kepe his doughter a virgin against her wyll, nor to constrain her againste the dissposition of her nature & inclination of her will. And that virginitie is a thinge voluntarie and not vnuoluntarie. And if anie interprise to geue his virgin an occation, that she sinne that shal not be imputed vnto her, but to him whiche hathe vp compultion constraned her to leade suche a kinde of lyfe.
            It is therfor manifeste that so farr as the gift and vocation extendeth, Photius maketh therin, against Uvinchester, with vs, bycause he acknowleged that the holy ghost teached herebye his Apostle, how the father ought not to tangle his vnwillynge doughter in the snare of virginitie, and that he should measure the steadfastnes of his iudgement concerning the keaping of his doughter, by her cōdition & will, though she be weake of age and kynde. And that it can not therfor be concluded

by this place of Paul, that anie potestate of the worlde hathe anye ryght to tangle anie of his subiectes in the snare of chastitie. And fynally that Uvī
               chester scorneth no lesse his Photius and other moste holye fathers & trewe interpreters of the Apostle, then vs, for so much as he writeth. Speake Bucer whens cōmeth steadfastnes?Uvinchesters scoffinges. sholde he (yow beinge the author) take counsaile of the mayden whiche is weake both in kinde & age? And in his hand writinge vnto me: The father had nede to be a cunninge phisitian, and verye well practysed that sholde fynde by the behauioure of his doughters body, maners, or wordes som thinge, wherby he may stedfastlye determine and apoint in his harte about the keapinge of her a virgin,Photiꝰ will haue ye giftes & vocatiō of God cō
                  sidered. without all ieopardie of fornication. But now let vs se whether Photius willeth not, that the Apostle commaunded the father to consyder Gods gift and vocation in his doughter, for so moch as he graunted, that he commaunde the father to beholde and marke suche thinges as belonge to his

doughter, & the disposytion of her nature and inclination of her minde. Truly he expounded Paul and was no peliagian as I suppose. And so seinge the Apostle in this selfe same chapter maketh it the peculier gift of God & certaine vocation to take chastitie or matrimonie vpon one godlye, how shold not Photius also acknowledg that the inclination of the doughters nature and intention of her minde to eyther kinde of lyuinge, is ye gift of God which he hath geuen to the doughter for her vocation? For what hast thow (said the Apostle) which yu hast not receaued?
            But what nede so moche a do about so vngodly and wrangling schoolyshe brawlynges? For whether (I beseche yow) shold a godly father consyder in his doughter sooner such thinges as are vitions of her selfe, and pernicyous, layd vnto her by the dyuell, or such helthsome thynges as are geuen her of GOD, from whom procedethe all good gyft? Sholde the Godlye father count it temerious desyre or

               upiditie in his mayden, or rather whither as Gods wyll calleth her who le

               h so his children with his spirite, & so bringeth to effect in them to wyll & to do that that is good, that euerye mā may be the more certain of his vocation and others that belong vnto him, yf he searche Godlie for it after praier and obserue the tokens and apointmē
               tes of the same.
            And so by this it is manifeste that the interpretation whiche we alleaged vpon this place of Paule (And hath no nede) is knowen and geuen as the verye proper and peculier interpretatation both by ye Apostles very words and also by the trew author therof, the holye ghost, and taken of all that interterprete it anye thinge to the purpose both olde and newe: Yea and euen of Photius him selfe whom Uvinchester brought against vs with suche a supercelyous and proude preiudice, as a witnesse of all the olde antiquitie.Uvinchesters manifest vanitie.
            
            Therfor let Uvinchester acknowlege him selfe her of to be conuict not onlye of a moste impudent lye, seinge

he dare write, that we are thonlye authores of this interpretation, and that it is oure inuention and faiuinge: but also to be a detestable babler and railer against the trewthe, and the reuerent antiquitie of holye fathers for bycawse thos his scoldinges and raylinges (of a foolyshe interpretation, colde peruerse not agreable to the Apostles wordes, and cleane con

               ye to them) be longe no lesse to them then to vs, who gaue ye selfe same interpretation vpon this place, as we do.
            Now therfor let vs se with what argument Uvinchester went about to shew that she's his reproches sticke in this interpretation, whiche is no more ours, then his Photius and all holye fathers that were ye beste interpreters of Paul. 
                  •

                  •
               ycientlye declared it to be a colde interpretation absurde, foolyshe and vnworthie for an Apostle, by thes argumentes.
            It appeareth not (saith he) yf we receaue this sense what ambiguitie or doubt the Apostle made plaine here with so manie wordes and so waighty

(Yf anie think that it is vncomelye for his vyrgin &c.) or to what dowbt he answered the Corinthiās. Nother that there is anie apointed tyme to marye a virgin, or that anye man sholde doubt to kepe his virgin that forsaketh matrymonye. Also (he saith) the Apostle myght haue spoken that we interprete, yf he had minded to teache it, in more open and lesse wordes, to saye. Let the father kepe his virgin, yf she be dysposed to lyue in her virginitie: Yf not, let hym marye her, wheras (yf we wyll ascribe oure sense to the Apostle) he sholde seeme to haue vsed an obscure tumblynge together of wordes, and farr from the purposed matter, and to speake wordes in vayne and wythout sense. On this fassyon doth Uvinchester reason in two of his writinges, in his hande writinge that he sent me and in the fyrst imprinted.
            Now therfor we are put to our shiftes to shewe bothe to what dowbtfull matter it is lykelye Paule made answere, and wyth how apt and mete wordes he dyd the same. Surelye the

holye fathers thought this no strange thinge, nor yet do anye at this day thinke the contrarie, yf they are indued with the cūmune sense, that at the same tyme in the churche of Corinthe, when they sowght for the Apostles mynde in thys behal
                  •
               e, there were not a fewe fathers (of the which sorte diuerse are founde emonge ours) which thought it an vncomelye thinge for them selues, and theyr doughters, and that they did not wel therin, if they kept their doughters at whome longe after they came to the age, mete to be maried▪ For Paule sayth 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                that is, paste theyr yonge age. For they lyued emonge the Heythen, and in a cytie that was so geuen to lecherye and excesse in carnall pleasures, that thervpon came the prouerbe. It is not for euerie man to visitie Corinthe. And besydes that, certain as yet of the Corinthians had in suche estimation the good wyll, & vitious iudgementes of the citisyns, and their frindes whiche were also of the Heythen, that they communycated of their Idolatrous sacrifices. And as yet

had suche peruerse iudgementes concerninge trew chastitie, that they had nede of admonissyon, how Christian men, and specyallye so manie, sholde

            And therfor who seeth not that of lykelyhood ther was verye moche dowbt and more then behoues, emonge the Corinthians, about the keaping of their doughters in their virginitie, after the tyme of mariage, whiche the Apostle ought by his doctrine to put out of dowbt, in the teachinge how they may kepe their doughters Godly, virgines,

or marie them. Therfor there is nothinge at all accordinge to our interpretation in this the Apostles answere whiche maye seme to be in vaine, and written for a iuste & necessary cawse.
            As moch appearethe therin, that it shold seme to be spoken subtyllye, obscurely or not aptlye and fyttlye to the matter. The Apostle preached to very manie the holy
                  •
               es and comodities of chastitie, so that it may seme therby (as Ambrose writ vpō this place) that wedlocke is vnprofitable and nothing to be regarded. Lyke as therfor he did in his firste answeres written in this chapter, so wolde he do in this answere also, yt is to saye, to take dilygent hede to the estimation and vse of holye matrymonye, and to teache by what deuotion the trew and exceptable chastytye vnto God sholde be taken and preserued. For he sawe before in speryte yt cruell ruinge and destruction of the churche, which Sathan had brought in to it by the preposterous and superstytyous praysynge of chastitie.
            He writ therfor. Yf anie man count it

litle honestie for him selfe & his doughter, other for the fore iudgemētes of other men, or in his owne iudgement, namelye bicawse he standeth in fere, that other vice or reproche will fall vpō his doughter to kepe his doughter after ye tyme, when as they are counted mete to be maried and behoueth so to be, let him do what he lysteth, he synneth not, let her be coopled in matrimonie. In thes wordes when he added. And behoueth so to be, did he 
                  •
               ot euidentlye teache, that the father owght to haue a religious respect of his iudgement, and ye Godlye, and also to ponder circonspectlye agreable to the word of God, what God hath apointed for his doughter, But whē he added this also (he sinneth not let her be coopled in matrimonye) therbye he confyrmed the holie estimation and Godly vse of mariage, wherof to be diligently admonisshed, if they had no nede to whom he wrate at that present tyme, yet he sawe before that their posteritie sholde haue. For he knewe he had the destribution of Gods worde, and doctrine, wherby the Godlye

sholde be instructed and gouerned vnto the ende of the worlde. Uvherfor he admonished suche as entended to kepe their doughters virgines, in manye wordes, who (so he saith) ha

Uvherbye he taught how devoutly the father owght to enquire whether God hath ordained & iudued his doughter with his giftes to Godlye virginitie, and whether he hath geuen him power to kepe his doughter, or offerithe him rather necessitie to marie her, wherupon it behoueth not rashlye and without anie aduisement of his owne, or his doughters affection or persuasyon to decer

wordes on this maner, what I beseche yow, may seme there, specially to godlye men not to be written playnly euydentlye, to the purpose and Godlye? But though Uvinchester supposethe that thes wordes of the Apostle, want their trewe and right sense, and seme foolyshe and vnmete for the purpose, yet wyll they neuer iudge it, which are indued with ye spyrite of Christe, and a pure mynde.
            He myght haue expressid this sentē

               de. Let him therfor shew him selfe what according to oure interpretation, is superstuous in them, or disagreeth to the matter he intreated vpon. Not onlye we perceaue no such thinge, but also so manye moste holye fathers and mete interpreters of ye Apostle sawe no such thinge. Herof therfor it may be sufficiē
               lye knowen with what vngodlye malepertnes Uvinchester hath spitefully reproched, that this not so moch oure interpretation, as all the holye fathers,

and his Photius is, & therfor hitherto his own also, is verie foolish, colde, obscure, and which maketh the holye ghostes wordes to be frustrated, and spokē in vaine, and without sense.
            Now let vs throughlye marke whether in thes the Apostles wordes, takē after this oure interpretation and the holye fathers, there seme to be anye 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , or owght contrary to it self. For that will Uvinchester haue to appeare by thes his two gloses. The one is that Paul saith: Notwithstanding
                  •
                if anie haue purposed surelye in his hart, but ther can be nothing stedfastly apoī
               ted by the father, concerning his doughter? Yf he ought to take into his counsayl her waueringe condition and wyl, and speciallye seinge we saye that no man at all, can at anie tyme knowe for a certaintie whether he him selfe be called to perpetuall chastitie. The other is yf the father folowe Gods vocation in his doughter, whether he shold apoint, to kepe her or to geue her to matrimonye, he shold euer haue necessitie of his iudgemēt, & neuer y• fre power of hys

Unto the first scholishe reason we answere, that in verie dede no mā, and moche lesse the mayde beinge a virgin, can for a suretie know by him self, what God hath apointed of him, no not so moch as at the tyme presēt, moch lesse for the tyme to come or for euer. But such as vnfainedly pray vnto god that he wolde vowchesafe to teache thē to knowe and in all pointes to folowe his will, and to lead them in his pathes thos doth not the moste bountifull father suffer to stycke in anye doubtfull deliberations,God maketh stedfaste the condicious of his. but openeth vnto them (as the spalmiste declareth) and teache them his wayes and pathes. For the lorde guideth the gentle in the iudgement, and teacheth the meeke his wayes. O who is he? The mā I saye, that feareth the lorde, for he wyll teach him the waye whiche he hath chosen. But this benefit of God and all other thinges, muste be sowght and prayed for with Godlie studye and holy praiers.

And when the father prayeth, and maketh inquisitiō one this maner to knowe and to accomplishe what so euer God him selfe will haue done with her, God oure moste boutifull father will graunt that he shall so determine of his doughter, and apoint the thinge whiche like as God hath apointed and ordained it before, so must it nedes be to the furtherance & honesty both of the father and of his doughter. And yt will God hī selfe make so firme

and steadfaste, yt ye doughter shal serue him in the stedfaste sanctitie of her bodye and sowle, albeit she be weake and of an vncertaine purpose of her selfe. For ye lordes counsaille endureth for euer,Psal. 39. & establissheth the worke him selfe, what so euer he worketh in his, that it maye continue for their furtherans to the verie ende. And so God will make fyrme and stedfaste holye chastite also, in all them whom he hath called therunto, so long as it shalbe to their furterance. When it beginneth to be to ye cō
               trarie, it is their dutie to follow God yt calleth them, and at his cōmaundement to make a permutatiō of the vnmaried state with holye matrimonye, and he wil not any man̄ of vnstedfastes or any other vice, especially emonge the children of God. For they whom God iustifieth and glorifyeth are wonte to be condemned, and to be mocking stockes to the men of this worlde.
            Thes thinges may Uvynchesters holynes and stedfastnes now mocke & scorne at his pleasure, yet do such as in yt trew obediēce of god, studie for trew

holynes and stedfastnes, place all their tymes,Psalm. xxxi. Ps lxxiij Ps. Cxi▪

            Thes thynges therfor who so godly ponder, shall knowe sufficientlye, yt there is nothynge in oure interpretation vpon thys place of Paul, whiche dothe not manifestlye condescend and agre with those the Apostles wordes, wherewith he requyreth, that the father shoulde appoynte and iudge stedfastlye in his harte about the keapyng of hys doughter.
            But for so muche as Uvynchester now agayne playeth the blynde sophister about the necessitie of the fathers decree, because the father, after oure interpretatyon, whiche requyreth that he folowe the vocation of the Lorde,

               d neuer the power ouer his owne wil, because the holy father must nedes folowe Gods vocation in hys doughter, these thynges ye se your selues howe vnworthy they are, that we shoulde speake moche of them. For yf the father perceaue that his doughter is called to chastitie, hathe he then any necessitie to marye her? But fre power he hath to kepe her a virgin. On the contrary parte, Yf he know, she is called to holy wedlock hath he any nede to kepe her a virgyn? But he hath fre power to marye her althoughe in verye dede it behoueth, and is necessarye so to be seynge it so pleaseth God. Uvynchester euer sticketh in that erroure, as thoughe all necessitie shold fight with fre wyll because yt necessitie is agaynst the lyberty of the wyl, which hath in it any compultion or force: but no suche necessitie can happen to them, that in trewe faythe folowe Gods worde. For lyke as in God and in the blessed with hym vpon this, there is great necessitie

of ryghte wyl and lyfe, because it is moste fre vnto them,Al necessitie is not agaynste fre wyll but that necessitye only which is of compultion. and all wyll of good and ryght is moste plesaunt so in the faythe of Christ, and in the dedes of faythe, wherbye we haue here a lytle taste to lyue a heauenly and holy lyfe, there is so moche the more fre and glad wil, as the necessitie of trueth and goodnes is more abundaunt in them, that is to saye, a more pure and perfect action of God. It is a requysite thynge vnto helthe to loue God: and who so knoweth hym perfectly of necessitie also loueth God. But vpon that who maye saye, that they that beleue in God, loue God agaynst theyr wyll, and haue not, as a fre wil so also fre power to loue God? He that is borne of God, can not synne, doth he therfor abstayne from synne beyng cōstrained, or hathe he not fre power to do well? But here of we entende to speake more in oure iuste defense agaynste Uvynchesters quarellynges.
            Notwithstandynge those thynges we haue nowe spoken are sufficient to thentent, thys maye be seene, that it

commeth not to passe by thys Uvynchesters faynynge the propriete and difference emonge them selues of these voyces, and matters of power and necessitie, that anye thynge is contayned in oure interpretation, which in al poī
               tes is not agreable and consentient to the Apostles wordes and meanynge. And so it is manifest that those Uvinchesters raylinges, of a colde interpretation, folyshe, peruerse, and not agreynge, but fyghtynge with the Apostles wordes, be all founde in hys owne gloses: and that not one of them maye cleaue or sticke in the enar

               atyon of thys place, whereof we entreat, which we haue alleaged after so manye holy fathers and approued interpreters of the Apostle. And that Uvinchester hym selfe, and not we is conuict of an vngodly malepertnes against the wordes of the Apostle: and agaynste the auncient antiquitie of the churche, not onelye of a proude despecte and contempte, but also of a wicked detractiō, and yll reporte.
            
               The cō
                  clusyon.Thus muche I thought beste to answere

somewhat at large concernynge the interpretation of this place (yf any thynke it vncomelye for hys virgyn &c.) agaynst Uvynchesters quarellinges and sophisticall determinations: because the trewe and naturall vnderstandynge of thys place maketh well to oure instituted defense of Christian libertye, whiche euer extendeth to holy matrimonye, as well, as to holy chastitie: And also, because Uvynchester in thys place braggeth to importunatelye agaynste vs. The matter it selfe constrayneth me to serue for oure iust defense agaynst hys checkes and sophystrye, those thynges wherin he hathe played the sophyster agaynst the fyue prepositions of Paul, which I noted in my answere vnto Latomus he made in the commendation of chastitie, sythe our present answere hath stretched so farre.
            Notwithstanding I thynke it necessary to admonyshe the reader of two places, because that by the proper vnderstandynge of them, it is very manifeste, how the holye gooste wolde confirme

vnto his the lyberty of matrimony, by suche thynges as in the fyrste Epistle to the Corinthians, the .vii. Chapter, he disputed concernynge the maryed and vnmaryed state. And also about the handelynge of these places, Uvinchester maketh great triumphes ouer vs, not yet vanquyshed. The one of those places is, the agremente and exposition of these sentenses. It is not good for a man to be alone, And it is good for a man not to touche a woman The other place is the interpretation of thys saynge: But for to auoyde fornication let euery man haue hys wyfe. &c.
            
               It is not good for a mā to be aloneConcernyng therfore the first place, Uvynchester blameth vs, because we affyrme, that the saiynge of the Lorde, whiche he spoke of Adam as the parēt of mankynde, and spake it not of euery man, pertayneth to al men, whiche are apte for matrimony: and not called to chastitie. But what man not cleane ignorāt of Christ hys doctryne knoweth not that they whiche are nother vnapt to matrymonye: nor destyned nor called

in mynde nor bodye to the solitary lyfe for the kyngdome of heauens sake, That is to saye, which are comprehended in no kynd of those men, whome the Lord hath except from the vocation of holye matrimony (Math. xix.) are (forsomoch as pertayneth to holye matrimony) in the same condition, that Adam was fyrste made in, so that it is not good for thē to passe hys lyfe with out wyues. For because the bountiful God hath called thē to matrimonye, & willeth them to serue hym in thys vocation, and not in the vnmaryed lyfe. And so it is good for these, both to touche a womā, yf they haue any (as Uvī
               chester graunteth) and also to take one, Yf they be without, which in lyke maner he must nedes grāt without he wil speake agaynst the holy ghost in these. Yf they can not refrayne, let them be coopled in matrimonye. It is better to marye then to burne. I wyll the yonger woman to marye. Albeit the matter be so about y• called vnto matrimony, yet because we shal at some tyme

be lyke vnto the Angels of God,It is good for a mā not to touch a womā
                cleane without matrimonye, and the holye ghoost pronounced thē so moch the more blessed, which by the holye chastitie drawe nerer vnto thys felicitie. Uvhy shoulde we not as wel say, that it is a good thynge by it selfe for euery man, not to touche a woman for the kyngdome of heauens sake. Yf we marke yt vniuersall condition, and not the vocation in thys lyfe, yf it be to matrimonye?
            Lyke as Paule sayde it was moche better for hym to be lowsed, and so to be with Christe, To saye, whan he sawe throughlye hys vniuersall vocation, and the lyfe euerlastyng recouered by Christ, and yet incontinently after he added to thys hys saynge.Phil. i But to abyde in the fleshe, is more nedeful for you, and therfor hitherto also better, namely for hys vocatyon, and the worke of the helthe of many, whiche the Lord intended to do by thys his Apostle. And so that whiche the Apostle thought to be of it selfe better and more to be desyred, he acknoweleged was not

so good, because of the tyme, & cōmaundement of God, as the contrarye, and in so doynge he requyreth it the more, but yet for hys owne tyme onlye, by so muche as he knewe it to be more necessary, to saye more acceptable to god and greater furtheraunce vnto men.As anye thyng is more necessary, so is it to ye godly more voluntary So dothe necessitie and fre will agre together, as I foresayd, in matters of faythe.
            These thynges I desyre the (moste Christian reader) to loke vpon more narrowlye, and then iudge thy selfe yf altogether after the same maner the vnmaryed lyfe. Yet in no wyse y• for the, whiche Wynchester fyghteth so stoutlye, but the Godlye and angelycall to saye, whiche al together ser

                be not of it selfe more to be desyred for of all GODS electe, and therfor better, then the maryed lyfe, because it conteyneth a more full meditation and taste of the heauenly lyfe, then dothe the other? Notwithstandyng, seynge God wyl dayly prolonge & brynge

vp men, euē vnto the very ende of this worlde, and that by the ministerye of hys sayntes, whiche may here also call vpon, and glorifye hym, euery one of hys sayntes, whome God hath called to the maryed lyfe, maye well saye with the Apostle. I wold wyshe truly beynge delyuered of the bonde of matrimonye, to stycke without separation vnto my God, and to aduaūce and fornyshe hys kyngdome, to serue hym so moche the more diligently and holilye, and thys shoulde be moche better: but sythe I se the other to be more necessary, because it is my Goddes pleasure (vpon whome alone dependeth to be good and profytable, whatsoeuer is lyke therevnto) that I shoulde serue my God vnder the yoke of matrimonye, hsy wyl be done, and let hym graunt, that in thys condityon of lyfe, whiche is harder & fuller of calamitie, I maye performe my ministerye acceptable vnto hym, and helthsome to hys churche.

Se that ye haue salt in your selues. For Uvynchester wyll haue thys word (haue) to haue as moche strengthe as, Let hym kepe her, and vse her whiche he hathe nowe already. In dede there wante not here to Uvynchester authores of thys hys interpretatyon of the holye fathers: as of hsy coniecture also, whiche he followeth, about the question of the Corinthiās, whereunto Paul in this place maketh answere. But Uvynchester

knoweth also thys, that by the authoritie of the holye fathers there cā no rule of faythe be authorysed or appoynted: nor yet any interpretation of scripture, whiche all men ought of necessitie to receaue. He knoweth also, yt the demonstration of oure opinyon cō
               cernyng chastitie consisteth not vpon the interpretation of this worde (haue) nor yet vpon the coniecture of the question of the Corinthians. The principles wherevpon it consisteth I haue here to fore recited: they remayne vnto vs vnlyfted at, whatsoeuer he hath cō
               cernynge the question of the Corinthians, or the proper sense of this precept. For to auoyde fornication, let euerye man haue hys wyfe. The trew and naturall interpretation of the whiche I haue graunted to hange vpon the question of the Corinthyans, whereunto the Apostle in thys place purposed to make answere: but what thys questiō shoulde be, it must be coniectured by the Apostles answeres: for a certanytie it can not be knowen. But Uvynchester declareth openly as it were for a suretye, that the Corinthians were

in a doubt,Uvynchesters hold affirmans in a doubtful matter. whether it were leful for a Christian to cleaue styl vnto hys wyfe which he maried before his Christianitie, and that they requyred of the Apostle to be instructed therof: and hath no other reason of thys hys coniecture, but that the Lorde sayd. Who so forsaketh no theyr parentes, wyfe, and children, can not be hys discyples, and suche lyke thynges concernynge the contempte of the world and this present lyfe: and that through these the Lordes saynges the Corinthyans conceaued suche a feruent burnynge to the vnmaryed lyfe, that they were in doubte of matrimonye, whether it myghte be kepte in Christianitie: here haue ye the reason and cause of Uvynchesters cō
               iecture. But confer ye thys with those the Apostles reprehentions and admonicions, wherebye he noted the Corinthians of very great negligence in keapynge the trewe chastitie of the lyfe, & in dryuynge a waye, and expellyng frō them manifeste vncleannes, fornicatiō, and adulterye. These reprehentions & admonicyons I say, whiche we read in the first Epistle to the Corinth. the .v.

vi. and .vij. chapt. And in the laste the xij. chapt. ponder ye godly and then discerne, what lykelyhode Uvynchester and his coniecture and the cause of his coniecture haue, and iudge howe it agreeth with suche great desyre of chastitie as Uvynchester attributeth vnto them. For yf the Corinthiās vpon those the Lordes saynges, wherin he requireth the forsakynge of wyues, childrē, the whole worlde, and of a mans own lyfe▪ began to be so feruent in the desyre of the chaste and heauenly life (whiche glose Uvynchester bryngeth in) yt they shoulde stande in doubt, whether it were leful for a Christian to reserue his wyfe now maryed: how colde they come into so moch lightnes and astoniyng in christes discipline, yt they had nede to be quickened of the Apostle with such a sharp taunt,i. Cor. v & reprehētiō, yt they shold not suppose suche fornication in theyr churches to be winked at, or dissē
               bled, as was not hard of emōg the gē
               tiles, yt any should haue his steppe mother to wyfe? & had nede to be taught & admo
                  •
               yshed with so many and so sore argumentes, yt fornication is to be fled

of Christians, & that it separateth thē from Christe, and excludeth them forth of hys kyngdome. Now, after these so sore and quycke reprehentions & admonitions,i. Co. xij the Apostle wrate vnto them, that he feared hym, lest when he returneth to them agayn, God should humble hym, so that he shoulde be dryuen to take vpon hym the sorowe of repentaunce for them, which dyd no repentaunce for theyr vncleannes, fornication and wantonnesse, which they cōmitted. Is it therfor any thyng likely that they were so by yonde al reason feruēt in the studye of chastitie, that the Apostle (as Uvynchester writteth) shoulde bestowe great labour to moderate thē in y• feruētnes. May it not moch more probable, that firste there were a fewe in the churche of Corinthe, whiche vnderstode the makyng chast for the kingdome of heauens sake, and in dede toke in hande to receaue it, and were to theyrs the authores that they shoulde take it vpon thē. Then that other as well they whiche were so hardely kept in coupled chastitie, as very many also which by ye misorderīg of thes feared yt
               
chastitie of others, which began to professe chastitie, were cleane against this new studye of chastitie emonge them, and perceaued thys kynde of lyuynge to be other litle worthy, or not very expedient for Christians. Lyke as not onelye the wise men of the world, whome certayne of the Corinthians as yet yonglynges in Christ, & carnall, made more of, then it behoueth, but also the Hebrues whiche professed the doctrine of God, rebuked chastitie, and praysed matrimony. For the moste auntient emong the Hebrues declared them opē
               ly, which remayned vnmaryed after theyr leful age to mary, yf it were not for the cause to learne Gods lawe, to be gilty of the cryme of bloud, sheddinge, and of the diminisshyng of the glorye and honour of God emong the people of Israel, and therfor vnworthy to be suffered emōg Gods people. They made so moche of the offyce of begettynge children emonge the people of Israel. The wise men emong the Grecyans agreynge with thes, were in opinyon, that they which were vnmaryed vnto fyue and thyrthye yeres, shold

not only be punisshed by the purse, but also put to shame, & that expressidly, to thentent no man shold do them yt honoure, which is accustomed to be done of ye yonger vnto the elders. By thes cawses therfor it is verye lyke, that there arose contentions emonge the Corinthians about this matter, as they were besydes full of cōtention. And for that cawse the wholl churche though mete to demaunde by epistle of the Apostle whether chastitie, & what chasttite shold be comelye for Christian relygion? In dede the Apostle in this place maketh farr greater a do and tarieth lenger in praysing chastitie then matrimony, for what shold ye prayse therof nede emōge them, whiche were now so feruent in ye studie of chastitie. But for somoch as ye Apostle in thes his answeres passed not matrimonye without commendation, it semeth he did it rather for this cawse, leaste the cōmendation of chastitie (which yet came to passe) sholde be taken in a backewarde sense of their posteritie, then yt the Corinthians had nede at that tyme to be taught, yt matrimonie is lefull and holye, which were

so hardlye persuaded that fornication is vnlefull, and against the holynes & profession of Christians.
            Make yow iudgement both of the coniecture & also of the reasons of ye coniectures of them both: yet (for all ye see how moche oure coniectures are more probable, then Uvinchesters) we sticke not vnto them in this cause, but vnto thos clere, and manifestlye pronunced oracles of God, which I haue here to fore recited, and wherupon I haue concluded oure demonstrations: Thos yf Uvinchester can, let him disconfecte, & bring forth the perfect foundations of his opinion, not such not trifling sophistrie, and querelinge scholishe reasons. But he in both his epistles against me braggethe hī self moste in thos places, wherin cōsisteth not the state of the state of the controuersyes betwext vs lettinge stippe like a valiaunt mā thos argumentes wherupō oure doctrine speciallye consysteth, and the contrarye therof, cleane ouerthrowen.

In ye meane season he maketh not word of the state it selfe of oure controuersy. And though we graunt the authoritye of this place to oure aduersaries, yet with how many euident and vndoubted testimonies of scrypture haue weshewed that whyche we contende together in this controuersye, to say

that it behoueth euerie Christian mā to knowe & to iudg him self by ye spirite of God, what so euer be offerid him in ye steade of Gods worde or precept, of whom so euer it be offerid, so that euerye man shold be truelye instructed of God, & vnfainidly beleue not man, but God, and recken it cursed if an Angell come from heauē and teache yt cōtrary.

That this moste large benefit of God, shall through yow passe through manie regions of Europa, ye feruent loue and vnfeaseable studie of youre Kynge in this age, & puissance of royaltie which he beareth towarde Christes pure religion & good letters, bringeth vnto vs no smale hoope, then that singuler and durable beneuolence of God towardes youre realme, wherbye he hath vowched safe to geue yow eft sones kinges which were chefe fauores and no wrisshers of good letters and artes nowe euer sins ye moste prudēt king Sigibertus,

By ye whiche gift of God the moste prudent & victorious kinge Henry the viij. so excelled that at this daye there is not one realme yt hath more well learned & godlye men in authoritie, nor none wherin Bisshops excell in so moche doctrine and puritie of life who so euer my Uvinchester hath not yet made subiect to the crosse of Christ his erudition which he hath verie largely receaued of God.
            It is therfor our parte, & all others that beare feruent loue to Christes kingdom continuallye to praye oure father most feruently through his sonn oure lorde Iesus Christe, that it wolde be his pleasure to continewe, & to brīg to passe with lyke prosperitie this his worke, begone emonge yow so luckily the worke of healthe, and not of yowrs onlye, but of manye of Gods Chyldren, throwghe yow the restytututyon I meane, of hys Kyngdome.
