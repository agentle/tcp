               IT behoueth / and it is necessary also: That euerye Christen mā know & beleue / owr lord Iesus Christe not to haue ouercharged his chirche with ouer many ceremonies / rites / lawes and preceptes. And also to knowe which be the principall lessons / doctrines / and preceptes all redy in nowmbre / concerning the verye trwe worship of god / and owr christen religion: whereby the cōgregaciō of christe is so perfytely and sufficiētly enstruct / that we can / ne oughte not to seke for / or desyer anye more.
         
      
      
         
            
            
               PAul / the chosen vessel of God / writing vnto his disciple Timothe / prophesied that in the later dayes / there shulde be men all for them selues / the louers of them selues / and of no man els / couetuouse / stoute / stobborne / and prowd / which wil be sene to haue a glittering shewe of godlines:ij. Timothe .iij. but they will renownce the pithey power & effecte thereof. And the thing it self they vtterly denie and reiecte. And therfore be they euer lerning / and neuer comen to the knowlege of the trowthe. And euen this same prophecie / many of vs reade it / but all we vnder stāde it not: as trwely in these owr dayes / as in tyme paste to be fulfylled. For the lawes concerning the welthe / gouernance / & good order of the chirche / they are nowe fermely decreed & set faste / and to morowe vnmade and marred agene / they ar treated & refracted / acted & vnacted / then thei reason for the reformacion of the chirche / and of the maner of the reformacion therof / whether this maner or waye ought to be directely or vndirectely / tolerable / iuste or absolutely / aperte / 

playne / or by colowr couertly brought to passe. And it is so subtyly disputed & so craftely hādled / that there is no maner nor mesure / non ende / nor no certaynte / forme nor fasshiō of their wauering lawes / incōstante actes / crafty counsels / forewritinges / afterwritinges / opinions / doctrines / sentences & myndes. There were once wrytē grete and many brode bokes of their decrees / decretalles Clementines & addicions / extrauagātes wandering far beyend & oute of the trwthe. Who is able to nowmbre and recyte the bokes / lawes & sentēces of all them that wrote for popes and papistes pleasurs? Who cā tel vs all the actes of parlementes / ordinances / and institucions of counsells and bisshops in their owen diocesses? By the which / all the people of God hath bē so combred / snarled / tyed and perplexed / that thei strongly & stoutely did lerne / yea and that alweys at all tymes / and yet coude they neuer come vnto the iuste knowlege of the trwthe. Yea thou shalt fynde euen emōg the peple many that abhorre and deteft these sayd holy popes decrees / lawes &c̄ / as roten / stinking running sores. And as touching the doctryne of the gospel / whiles theis lawers & scolemen studye these decrees and scole mater / thei finde

nothing in it ferme nor certayne (their iugemēt is so corrupt) nor obteyne thei any godly frute for their saluacion / but poyson & corrupcion of their owen soules / & of their iudgemēt. But yet thei lerne stoutely theise deuillisshe antichristen decrees and lawes &c̄ / and neuer come thei vnto any good and perfit ende of any good learning / so that their myndes maye be satisfied and at reste in guyette / their selues neuer hauinge in any iuste nowmbre the cheife articles and principall poyntes of the trwe religiō. Wherefore that it might apere / euē but to mene lerned & simple wittes / owr lord Iesus not to haue onered / burdened and charged his chirche with any constitucions and rytes / ether heuye or many / or obscure derke / or harde / or vnable to be expressed / but that tharticles of owre faythe (whereby the faythefull ar made perfet) be sewe & sone tolde: we shal laye forthe theise thinges which the lorde hathe deliuered to vs / & which be ower articles in brief summe / where with his chirche is content & fynissed. But let no man thinke this mater to be longer in telling / then that it maye be but in fewe wordes fynished. For the treatese of the trwthe and religiō is contēt with very fewe wordes / nothing regarding nor

requiring any curiouse & laborouse loquacite or longe babling. I therfore shall endeuour my selfe syncerely so to treate this mater so profitable and necessary / that not with oute great frute this wolde be read and herde.
            That our Lorde Iesus hath not onered his chirche / but subdewed it vnto a pleasaunt yoke of a swete seruitute / him selfe witnesseth in Math. xi. sayīg.The lorde hathe not ouercharged his chirche. All thingis ar delyuerd to me of my father / & noman knoweth the sone but the father / nether any man knoweth the father but the sone / and vnto whom soeuer the sone will reuele him. Come ye all vnto me that labour and ar burdened / and I shall ease and refresshe you. Take my yoke vpon you / & lerne of me which am mylde / meek & humble hearted / and ye shall fynde ease and quyetnes in your soules. For my yoke is pleasaunt / & my burdē light.Iere. ij. Firste of all he saithe himself to be the fontaine of all goodnes / and euen that liuely plentuouse spring neuer to be drye drawne / which will satisfie his childerne moste plentuouslye. Then he addeth / himselfe to be that heuenly and faithfull teacher / which one onely maye trwly delyuer & geue forthe the celestiall wysedom & perfit doctrine. Hereof he exhorteth all men to come to him / how many so euer ar perplexed

               ted / greued / troubled & pressed downe with to heuye burdēs. For vnto all mē he promiseth counforte and quietnes present helpe / remedye / and saciete / that is to satisfye their desier with all goodnes / and to be brief / euen the trewe institucion and enstrucciō in all trwthe / and a iuste tranquilyte of myndes.Psalm. c.ij. He exhorteth also / that (the yoke of the world caste of) mē submitte and put their neckes vnder goddes holye swete yoke. For this yoke he pronownceth it to be pleasaunt & light. Not onely be cause ther is nothing harde to a louing & willing mā / but also for that this doctrine is the moste playne and simple / And euē the worde (as saith the prophete) which is abreuiated & made shorte Where of the same prophete also prophecying of the kingdō of Christ (which is his doctrine cryeth in the persone of God sayinge Herken you that be thirsty.Esay. x.
               Esa. lv. Come ye all vnto the waters / euen he that hath no money Come / bye and eate. Come (I saye) bie with out money wyne and mylke / yea / and with oute any price. Wherfore laye ye forth your money for that at fedeth not / and spende ye your labour about that at fedeth not? Heare heare (I tell you) me / and eate that at good

Heare me (I saye) and your soule shall liue: & I shall smyte vp an euerlasting couenaunt with you / euen the faithefull mercies promised to Dauid. Behold I haue geuen him to testifye of me to the gentyls / to be a leader & master to the populouse heithen. By these wordes / owre benigne and trwe god prouoketh all mortal men to come to him onely / he excludeth none at all. For he calleth thē not vnto certayne heuey burdēs to be borne / for he foreseing these heuey infinite dampnable burdens of mens ceremonies / rites and tradicions / institucions / inuencions / actes / articles (and I can not tell what) commaunded non to be so hardy / as to beare a tankerde of water thorowe Solomons temple. By water fetched at muddy pyttes (as Ieremy expowneth it) meaning the heuey vnsauerye and vnprofitable ceremonies / rytes &c̄ / invē

               Ephe. iiij. He rebuketh also our folisshnes / which ar caried aboute and diuersly

vexed with varye / dyuerse / contrarye / and moste harde kyndes of sondrye doctryne / of whiche there cometh no profite / but greate hyndraunce and vndoyng to oure housholdes and goodes. Come therfore to me (saith he) heare me / me (I saye) and your soules shall liue. For he offereth to these obayers & comers to him a greate gyfte in couenaunt / promisyng vs euē Christe him selfe / in whō onely he promiseth hymselfe / to geue vs all thinges. Let vs nowe therfore see how God hathe performed thys couenaunt and promise / and what thynges the father hath geuen vs in christe / euē christe hymselfe to witnes.
            When the onely begoten sonne of God / which is in the bosome of the father / descended from heuē vnto vs / and being very god and man Iesus Christe shuld preche the heuenly wysedom / euen the gospell / vnto the hole worlde / and shuld enstructe & institute his chirche in the trwe religion:The doctrine deliuerd of chryst to his chirche. he wrapped not / nor combred / nor clogged not the myndes and soules of his peple with diuerse and manyfolde tradiciōs: nether disputed he nor reasoned he with them any lōge tyme / ether obscurelye / or sharpelye of the trwe saluacion and iustificacion / snarling their consciences / inuoluing the christē religion in any subtily

and harde questions: but often tymes in one lytle shorte sermone he gaue vs all thinge what so euer is necessary & ꝑteyning vnto owr very saluaciō / which thinge we shall nowe clerely setforth in playne examples.
            In Iohn / the .iij. the Lorde receyuing Nicodemus vnto him fully and perfytlye to be taught in all that same lesson and in his institucion / he dothe nothing els teche him / but that this master of Israel might vnderstāde and knowe that who so euer will aspire vnto life euerlasting / he muste be borne agene from aboue / euen of the holye goste: that is to saye / these same owr owne strengthe / enforcementes innated and ingrauen in to vs from owr firste birth / to haue nothing at all no disposicion of owre selues / no inclinacion promptnes / nor red

And also that man nowe takē vp to him from oute of the derkenes of errours and synnes / he might ꝑfitlye walke in the lyghte of trwthe and puernes. What coude haue bē spokē (I praye you) in so grete & waighty a mater more briefly? or coude haue ben sayd playnelier and more fullye & ꝑfetly? I thinke there can nomā this taught in this heuēly philosophie require any more Nether any other wyse or by other meanes did he instructe the woman of Samarye at the well / but that he semeth there to haue vsed a more compēdiouse briefnes.Ioā. iiij. In the scole at Caperne / whē he was desyered of some men and asked what thei shuld do / that they might worke the workes of god?Ioā. vi. he answerde them with one worde. This is the worke of god / euen to beleue in him whom he hath sent / albeit by and by he added a lytle lēger exposiciō of the same / how that him selfe being the breade of lyfe was comen in to the world / howe and by what wayes he shulde prepare his owne flesshe and his bloude in to the meate and drynke which geueth life to the soule. And agene vnder what maner he wolde be eaten and dronkē / euen spiritually thorowe faith. But yet is that same exposicion

so playnly and so briefly wound vp that vnto noman it can apere to be onerouse and heuey / euen as thexposicion of the lawe in Mathew is a lytle largelyer drawen at length / but a non after it is briefly knit vp & gadered agene into this one sentēce. Mat. v.vi. & vij. Wherfore all thynges what souer ye wolde men shuld do to you / euen so and the same do you vnto them. For into this ende tēde the lawe and prophets. Vnto this agreeth also that at the lorde on this maner saith in Iohn.Ioā xiij. and .xv. This is my precept that ye loue one a nother euen as I haue loued you / euen the same that is red in Paul / owe ye nothing to any mā but this onely / euē one to loue a nother.

                  o. xiij. For he that loueth a nother hath fulfylled the lawe Who can saye that these lessons be to longe or confusely inuolued / or to derke and obscure? In that same his laste souper when nowe he shuld opē to his disciples the greatest and hyghest mysteries and secretes of owr faith & shuld powerforth all his hole godly breste vnto sauit Thomas whē he asked him / Master / we knowe not whother thou goist / and how might we knowe the waye? With one sentence he expowning and shewing them / whother he went / wherfore he muste dye / & which is the sewerest & most certayne waye vnto heuē / sayd. I am the waye / the trowth

and the lyfe. There cometh noman to the father but by me. In which wordes he expressed the cause and frute of his deth / & shewed them the waye vnto heuē / yea and that moste playnely he shewed it them. And besydes thys all wother wayes ordened or inuented by mē besides this waye / he plucked them vp / he destroied / casted down / and stā
               ped thē vnder his feet for naught / euē wrōg wayes / dampnable and vngodly. Whereof verely Iohn boldened / said in hys canonik pistell. God hath geuen vs eternall life and this life is in hys sone / and whoso haue the sone hath life / and he that hath not the sone hath not life. Vnto the which saingis iustely agreeth euē the same that s. Paul ꝓpowned with a meruelous euidence vnto the Ephesiens / God to haue rehersed / and (as in brief some) brought it / and in Christe concluded. so that nowe oute of this same only Christ / as it were oute of the barne of all goodnes / men myght fetche the thynge which before as it were by pece mele / was fetched out of many sondry partes of scripture / yea / and euen the Lorde Iesus himselfe in Mathew dampneth / and techeth vs to auoid / and abhor these men who soeuer thei be / which deuyde the myndes of the faithfull / and induce them vnto many and dyuerse thinges as

necessary or profitable vnto thobteyning of saluaciō. For if any mā (saith he) tell you. Lo here is Christ / or there is he / beleue him not For ther shall aryse false anoynted and false prophetes & shall shewe forth tokens & prodygiouse wonders / so that (if it were possible) euen the very elect might be brought in to erroure.Math. xxiiij. Take heed (sayth Christe) for I haue now told it you before. If therfor they tel you / Lo he is in the deserte & solitary places of religiō / go not once forth / or say / see he is in the secrete places as in the p̄uey pixe and secrete ciborye / beleue it not. What thē shall the faithfull soule do? He shall depende of the mouthe and grace of the onlye Lorde / which hath cōmaunded his chosen tobe ware and auoide these maner abhominable deceytes of men sondrelye knittinge / smytinge / and diuidyng into many opiniōs the hertes of the faithfull with this wyked scysme: and hath set forth before vs himself onely the teacher of the trwth and in fewe wordes thexpiacion of synnes & purging from the same euen the mercy seat of grace and forgiuenes in euery necessite to be sought / and to flye vnto him. For this is euē he / that same master geuen vnto all the worlde / whych also hath dyed for vs / yea and euen he that is rysen

agene vnto life / and sitteth on the ryght hande of god / there makinge continuall intercession for vs / being that onely all alone perpetuall preist with onelye one sacrifyce for euer finisshing and perfet making them which ar sanctified. Euery man (I suppose) clerely vnderstondith and perceyueth it wel that in / and for Christe / the father hath geuen vs all thinges. All men see what maner teching was the doctrine of the Lorde cōcerning owr saluacion / wherby we be iustified and who is the life of the faithfull / a doctrine (I saye) which is short and brief / but yet clare / manifest / full and perfet in euery parte. Hitherto perteynith also his tradicion of the benefittes & good will to be geuē forth / of the prayers of the faithfull / and of fasting and chastysing of the bodye / euē siche doctrine as is bothe brief and cleare (as ye may see in Mat. vi. cap. hauing nether any difficultye nor burden. Which tradicion and doctrine of christe notwithstōding yet apereth intolerable & vnable to be expressed & vnderstā
               dē of the laye peple / if thou estemest it of the disputaciōs of sophisters / & take it at the subtile setting forth of the scolastical scolders.
            Here folowe all the Sacraments that Christe delyuered to his chirche.
            
               Now as towching the sacraments / very fewe they were which the Lorde commytted vnto his chirche / euen onely these tweyne / baptisme and the signe or remembraunce of his body and blode. For as for Iohn his baptisme / he dyspiced it not / but with the s
                  ••
               e himselfe was sanctified. And eftesone after he sending his disciples into all the worlde to preache his gospell and to declare it vnto all naciōs and gentyles sayd. See that ye be going to teache all the gentyles or nacions / who soeuer thei be / baptising them in to the name of the father / the sone / & the holy gost. In which institucion thou shalt neuer fynde any thing ether harde or heuye or not playnly spoken and expressed. And as for himself whiles he lyued vpō the erth and layd forth the holsome preching of the gospell / baptysed noman / but his disciples he commanded to baptise. For the worde of god is more beter and more preciouse then the sacrmentes yea / and faith its elfe is more noble then the sacramētes.Hebre. xi. For with oute faith it is vnpossible for eny man to please god. And with out faith / sacramentes may be ministred: but ꝓfit shall thei not.

                substanciall body of Christe really naturally substancially corporally as longe / as brode / as thyke / as heuey (& I can not tell what nor howe) as he hāged on the crosse. And agene

what into what thing is cōuerted / whether brede is turned into nothinge / or in to Christus body? what substance abideth still and remayneth? what substance is loste or ceasseth to be? and in so ceassing from his owne substance / whether it be nothing at all / the accidents / that is to saye / whightnes / lightnes / heuynes / taste breking baking &c̄ / whether thei there abide still with out substance / and whether he be whol with all his membres in the wholl sacramēt or brede / and wholl in euery peese broken / whether one bodye may be in heuen and erth and in a thousande places at once. And howe so grete a bodye may be wholl in so lytle a crome of breade. And whether there be his gloriouse immortal impassible bodye / or his body mortall and passible as it was in his souper sittynge with his disciples? But Christe at his souper taughte thē playnely the ferme faith in / and to beleue in god / he disputed of brotherlye loue clerely / and treated of the remission of synnes / of pacience and constancye in aduersite / and preched them of the adsewered certayn hope of that blessed lyfe to come. For these thynges ar holsome and aperteyning to owr saluaciō / & to the knowlege of god / these thingis requyreth he of his peple.
            
               Whē owr Lorde Christe had delyuered this doctryne concerning the christē religiō / and the discipline of the sacramentes priuatly to his disciples and openly to all men dispersed thorowe Galyle and Iewrye / and also after that he had purged by his innocent dethe on the crosse the sinnes of the hole world:What thinges were delyuered vnto the chirche by the holye goste. & was bureyd / the third daye he ryseth from dethe / and by .xl. dayes he apered to his disciples / and leste thei shuld haue douted of his resurreccion / he shewed himself vnto them by many euident profes / himselfe verelye to haue had rysen from dethe / in the mean tyme geuing also precepts vnto the apostles / of the chirche or cōgregacions to be called togither and constituted thorowe out all the worlde / and thus all thingis finisshed / he is ascēded into heuen: and sitteth in glorye at the right hande of the father. And the precepts which he gaue vnto his / were of this maner. That thei shuld go forth into all the rownd world and preche his gospell / that is repētāce and remissiō of sinnes in the name of christe / and that thei shuld also baptyse the beleuers therof / teaching them to kepe all thingis which himself had commaūded them. By the which thing verely he signified the moste ꝑfit kynde of techinge to be delyuered to them. For

that at he addeth / Thei shuld abyde and wait for the coming of the holy goste / pertayneth to that purpose vnto the which many mē violently pluk it / as thoughe this holye goste shuld haue delyuered to them a nother news and more large doctryne thē Christe had before taught them. For euen himselfe openly sayd in his gospell. He shall not speke out of him self / but all thingis what soeuer he hath herde shall he speke / & agene.Ioā. xvi He shall receyue it out of my precepts and doctrine / and so shall he shewe it vnto you. Agene. That same counforter and techer euen the holy spirit whom the father shall sende in my name / he shall teche you all thingis / and shall laye vpon your hertis imprīted theryn faste all those things what soeuer I haue tolde & taught you. Lo / he sayth he shall teche you all thingis and because thei shuld not vnderstonde it of any new doctrine / or thinke that Chryst perchaunce had not taught them all thingis necessary for theirs and owr saluacion / but had left out some vnwriten verites. He addeth for a more declaraciō. And shal all those thingis prynte in your hertis the which I my self tolde and spake vnto you. Wheresoit folowthe that owr Lorde Christe taughte them all thīgis / but by the reason of their infirmite

and weaknes those all thingis or els many of them / thei had foregoten / so that it was necessarye for them those lessons by the holy spirit to be called agene and beaten faster into their myndes and memory / & there depelyer to be infastened / & euery thing fullyer at large to be explicated & declared.
            But now / lest any man shuld doute of these thingis / we wyll gladlye also gather agene togither into a some / what thingis the apostles aftir thei receyued the holy gost gaue & deliuerd to the chirchis to be obserued.What the apostles delyuered vnto the chirche And that we might begyn this demonstraciō euē of S. Peter. Ye shall see that he was called forth on a tyme vnto Cornelye the capitayn of the Italyk legiō. For the angell of the lorde had told him / that he shuld sende men vnto Ioppen called now porte Iaph / and call Symō peter.Actu. x. For he shall tell the what thou muste do. Which when he was called & now comen / and shuld tell him what he shuld do: he prescribed him no nother thynge els then that he muste beleue in Iesus Christe. For he prechid not els to him but chryst euē to be crucified for vs / buryed / and the thirde daye to haue had rysen from deth / yea and himself in the same his preching witnesseth himselfe not to haue had receiued any thing els of the

Lorde to be preched saying. The Lorde commaunded vs to preache to the people and to testyfye that it is he which is constituted of god to be iuge of the quyk & dede. Vnto this mā all the prophetes bere witnesse that who so beleue he shall receiue remission of his sinnes thorow his name. Who here of (I praye you) vnderstāde the apostles not to haue had delyuered anye wother thingis to the peple dispersed thorow out the worlde then the same which thei receiued delyuered to them of the lorde? Who seeth not thissame tradicion and doctryne delyuered to be sufficient vnto saluaciō to be obtayned / and vnto the perfitfull religion of christe? For the angell tolde him clerely that Peter shuld shew him what he muste do. And Luke added by & by what he shewed and prescribed him / euen nothing els then that at is expowned and layd forth in these fewe wordis. And a non he baptised him with his familye. Peter thrusted in nothing into Cornelius of any auriculare confessiō / nor of any puate absoluciō / he taught him nothinge of cases reserued to the Pope. He forgote satisfaccion indulgēcis pardons and popisshe penaunce to be enioyned him. He deliuered him nothing of merites and celebracion of mysses or of vowes of chastite

to be payd and kept. Nothtng of inuocacion of sayntes / nor worshiping of images / he cō
               maunded him nothing concerning pilgrimages to Rome or to Hierusalem / no mencion of matens euēsong ladypsalters sensing candies processions nor yet of holy brede nor holy water nor asshes: but he preched him Christe playnly and in him onely he shewed him all thīgis. And euē the same Peter the most constant and feruent affirmer and defender of the simplicite and playnesse of the faith & doctryne of christe / in the counsel holden at Hierusalem in the which this question was treated: Whether onely faith iustifieth / and whether the workes of the lawe called good werks shuld be ioyned to faith vnto the ꝑfecciō of a christē man: he riseth vp & with great grauite pronounceth into these wordes. Ye men and brethern / ye knowe that of the olde tyme god chose out among vs / that throrow my mouthe the gentyles shuld here the worde of the gospell & beleue it.Acts. xv And god which knowth mens hartis hath testifyed vnto thē geuing them the holy goste as well as vnto vs / no difference putting betwixt vs and thē when by faith he hath purifyed the hertis of them. Nowe therefore / wherefore tempte ye god / that anye yoke shulde be layd vpon the

neckis of the disciples / which nether owr fathers nor we haue ben able to beare? But by the grace of owr Lorde Iesu christe we beleue to be salued euen as thei beleued and were saued. Hitherto haue we recyted the wordis of saynt Peter. Here he saith there is but one / and that is a sewer and certayne waye vnto saluacion / but one & that the moste full and perfit forme of iustifying / euen by the grace of owr lorde Iesu christe. Vnto this tradicion Cornelius with all his familye familiar & kinsfolk cleaued fast with all his whol herte and with trwe faith & receiued the testimony of the sones of god / in this mean ceason (saith Peter) I nether added nor layd vp on his shuldern any burden of the lawe: onely preched I Christe into whom he beleued. Wherfore / the grace of god & faith into christe is sufficient vnto saluaciō / nether is it necessary any thīge to be added out of the lawe to make perfit owr iustificacion. And as for those fewe tradicyons whiche there in that chap. a non ar red & added or sayd to be putto / were obserued for the cōsideracion of the tendernes yet of the tyme / & for the maners yet of the men of that worlde / not that they shuld be perpetuall / but for charityes sake kept in the cities for a litle time in the which

cytes Moses was yet red openlye in their synagoges and scoles.
            Nowe of the .xiij. chap. of the actes & .xv. ca. is it manyfest / that nether Paul himself the apostle taught ether other thingis / or moo / or not the same to the chirches of the gentyles. But in his pistles right diligently he declareth all faitfull / in christe to haue and fynde all thingis which ar necessary vnto the very saluacion and perfeccion of christes religion / nor to nede any other meanes els besydes Christe or with christe to lyue blessedly. For euē in the pistle to the philippians. The things which once were lucre and plesaunte to me (he sayth) I nowe knowe the same for christis sake to be hurte and hindrance to me yea I knowe now all things to be damage / for that excellent knowleges sake of Chryst Iesu my lorde / for whose sake I reputed all thinges to be hurtfull and damage and estemed and reputed them for dunge and dyrte / that I my self might get christe for my lucre and aduauntage and that I might be founde in him / hauing not my nowne rightwysnes out of the lawe and good workis / but that same rightwysnes whiche is thorow the faith of christe. And for this cause he euery where exhorteth almē vnto the faith into owr lorde

Iesu / with the which faith also he commē
               deth and setteth forth as the frutes of faith / as innocency of lyuing / charite and also feruent prayers vnto the Lorde. And this apostle baptized as the Lorde had commaunded him / althowgh he confesseth himselfe in the mean ceason / very fewe or non to haue baptized.i. Cor. i. The souper of the Lorde he celebrated no nother wise / nor in no nother wyse commaunded he the Corīthes to celebrate it / thē the lorde himself had instituted and fyrst ordened it.i. cor. xi. For as for me (he sayth) I haue not delyuered vnto you any thinge concerninge this souper / but euen the very same that I haue receiued of the lorde &c̄ / the place is openly knowne .i. Corin. xi. These (I saye) ar the tradicions which S. Paul / at the precept of the lorde hath deliuered vnto the chirches euen an absolute perfit and full example of an absolute crystē doctryne & of a iuste chirch And now verely there is nothing more certayn thē that all the mother apostles folowed the same self waye and maner of prechīge when thei all with one instituciō & one spirit gathered togither the cōgregaciōs of god. Owt of these all / I suppose it to be clere and playne / Owr Lorde Iesus not to haue had 
                  •
               nerated his chirche: and which be the verye

principall cheife poyntes and articles fewe in nowmber by the which his congregacion and chirche is fully and perfitly so finisshed / that it want nothing:Whiche be these cheif pncipal sufficiēt articles geuen to the chirche. that is to weit euē the doctrine of the gospell or diuine verite wherein / faith into god / the loue of my neighbor publik iustice / pacience in the crosse / holines in lyuinge / & that benigne holy mercifull distributing of owr goodis to the pore / pure & faithfull prayer / and the reuerēt religiouse right vse of the sacramētes. In these (I saye) very fewe thīgis nothing ouerouse / the chirche of chryst is perfitly finisshed / so that it is wholl and perfit in nothing diminisshed wā
               ting any thinge.i. Timothe .iij. This same chirche I mean which Paul trwly calleth the house of the lyuing God / the pylar and fote of the trwth / which stōdeth faste vpō and cleaueth to that foundaciō stone Iesus chryst.i. cor. iij. And if any mā yet dowteth and thinketh many mo thingis to be requyred vnto her perfeccion: let him hear Luke in the actis of the apostles / describinge the primatiue or firste / that is to saye that moste of all perfit full chirche of Christe gathered to gither euen of the apostles / no moo thingis thē these there in that tyme putting in mynde vnto them: therof gathering that euen now like wyse / by the same onelye

cheif principalls comitted vnto thē / that there oute of the fame / the perfitst congregacions might be gathered / made perfit & conserued. For in the .ij. of the actes aftir Luke had shewed by what maner the holy gost had bē geuē to the apostles / anon he declareth how and in what maner Peter preched christe vnto the peple of Israel / & how that thei nowe compunct and striken in herte asked: What shall we do ye men and brethern? which Peter answerde in these wordis. Resipiscite: et baptizetur vnusquisque vestrum in nomē Iesu christi ad remissionem peccatorum / Repē
               te and chaunge your lyuing and be baptized euery one of you into the name of Iesu christe / so to haue remission of your synnes by faith: and ye shall receiue the gyft of the holy goste. And aftir a fewe mo wordis. S. Luke addeth / exhorting thē with many mo wordis saying. Be ye p̄serued and kepe your selues from this peruerse and euel generaciō. In the which answer of Peter and exposiciō of the story by Luke / fyrst we haue the cheif principals of the euangelyk doctryne / euen faith and repentāce thorow the name of christe / and then an exhortacion and warninge / and at laste the sacrament of baptisme. And anone aftir Luke addeth yet vnto these wordis.

Thei were verely perseuerīge in the doctrine of the apostles / and in frendely charitable distributing their goodis & in the brecking of the brede / & in prayers. In the whiche wordis also / the doctrine of thapostles is regathered as it were in to a breif somme & not onely it / but also the constant perseuerā
               ce in the apostles doctrine / which cheiflye is moste necessary / also the louing distributing of their goodis / and the breking of the brede which is the souper of the lorde and faithfull praying. In these (I saye) so fewe in nowmber cheif principals / the wryter of the actes of thapostles clerely and perfitlye finisshed vp complete that fyrste primatiue and apostolik chirche the which neuer man / excepte he were vngodly / wolde saye but it was the moste full / perfit / & wholl iuste chirch. Sewerly Luke in thende of the same chap. openly calleth it the chirch / saying. The lorde added dayly vnto the chirche sich as shuldbe saued / confessing also helth and saluaciō to be in sich a chirche / & as many as come into the felowship of sich a congregacion to be saued. with these very fewe principall institucions and doctrynes may the chirche therfore (as ye may here see) be gathered perfitlye fynisshed and conserued / yea and that is the very

iuste and trwe chirch which enstructed with these fewe thingis cleaueth to / and is sustayned vpon christe the very rok. But here also haue ye the testimonies of holy men. For lactancius in his boke of the trwe wisedom the v. boke of his institu. cap. xxx. sayth / That same onely is the vniuersall chirch which holdeth the trw worship. This is the fountayn of trwth / this is the hous of faith / this is the temple of god / wherein if anye entreth not / or oute of the which if any go forth he shalbe farre from the hope of eternall life and helth But yet because heretyks thinke their chirche to be the catholik chirch / ye shall knowe that same to be the trwe chirch in the whiche is the religiō and trwe worship of god in spirit and in no vtward ceremonies of men / in which is confession of synnes vnto god and repentance which heleth holsomly synnes & woūdes / vnto the which the weaknes of the flesshe is subiect. These wordis Lactancius wrote which disputing of the trwe worship in his .vi. boke of his institu. cap. i. saith. The holy and singulare maiesty of god desiereth nothinge els of man then onely innocencye whiche if any offreth it to god / he hath made a sufficiēt sacrifice both godly and religiously. Which thinge I haue added to / that thou

mightest the trwlyer vnderstande that at he sayd / the catholik chirch to be euen the same which holdeth the trwe worship of god. And Austen the very trwe doctour of the chirche answering to the questiōs of Ianuary in his c.xviij. pistle writeth playnly into these wordis. Firste of all I wold thou shuldest holde in mynde the cheif poynt & principall of this disputacion / euen owr Lorde Iesus Christe (as himself sayth in his gospell) to haue subdewed and layd owr neckes vnder his moste pleasaunte yoke and his light easye burden. Whereby he hath bownde & yoked togither the chirch and societe of the newe peple with Sacramēts very fewe in nowmber / most easye to be obserued / in significacion moste noble and excellent / euen Baptisme by whiche we be consecrated into the name of the trinite / and the Communion or partaking emōg many of the bodye and bloude of owr lorde / with sich like (if there be any) commended to vs in the scripturs: those excepte / whiche for the congruence of the hertis of the olde peple and for the tendre tyme of the prophetes burdened their bondage: which certayne sacraments and ceremonies be siche as ye read in the .v. bokes of Moses and so forth folowing vnto the grace of the gospell.
            
               But / mennis testimonies left / let vs return to the wittnesses of god / and agene to the testimonies of the most excellent apostles Peter Ihon and Paul / whom I shall yet more largelye allege / that in the mouthe of .ij. or iij. this inuicte verite / that is to weit / that in these fewe poyntis and principals in nowmber / the chirch be made perfit / might be affirmed the fastlyer and the stronglyer proued. For Peter after that he hade put forth a certayn fewe doctrynes & precepts of the faith / charite / pacience and beneficence / and had exhorted the godly to expresse thē in holy workes: a non he addeth. These thinges if ye do: ye shal not slyde at any tyme. For verely by this maner shall the entrese into the eternall kingdom of owr Lorde & sauiour christe Iesu be aboundantly ministred vnto you. But & if he had not beleued this kynde of doctryne which now we haue recyted / to be sufficient vnto that life to be obtayned & for the peple of god to be made ꝑfit / he had neuer sayd By this maner or wayes aboundantly (obserue the pithei waight of this word Aboū
               dātly) shal thentres into his kingdō be mynistred vnto you. Then / verely were not these monkisshe and fryerlye odiouse orders / nether their vngodly rules of mōkis friers &c̄ / 

nor yet them selues. Thē were there no misses / no siche maner of questions or tradiciōs as haue owr idle belled bisshops and skoldīg scolemen many yeres aftyr at laste dreamed and broughte into the chirche. And yet with out these dead dreames (sayth S. Peter) Aboundant and plentuouse entresse by the dotrine of the apostles to be layd open vnto all men desyeringe to com to that lyfe eternall. Saynt Ihon in his pistle / sayth. The thinge which ye haue herd from the beginnyng / abyde there in / or let it abyde in you. If that doctrine whiche ye haue herde from the begī
               ning abyde in you / then shall you also abyde and dwell in the sone & in the father. Lo / here he promiseth to them a perfit and full felowship and coniunccion of the father and of the sone with those faithfull which continewe & abyde in that kynde of doctrine which thapostles from the begynning of their prechinge delyuered thē. But from that begining thei gaue them no nother doctrine then the same which (thei sayd) we haue herde. Wherfore that tradicion muste be sufficient vnto perfeccion. S. Paul not onely bindeth the preacher of the gospell vnto the same breif and simple playne kynde of doctryne / but besydes that / he prophecieth certayne pestelent pharisais

and papistis to come / which (euē as we now see them) will not heare that same trwth delyuered to the chirches / confessed and confirmed with myracles / but will turne themselues vnto vayne fables and most vayne lyes and trifles.ij. Timo iij. & iiij. For thus writeth he vnto Timothe. I beseche the humbly before god & owre Lorde Iesu christe whiche shall come to iuge the quik & deade in his owne aperaunce & in his kingdom / preche thou the worde & sermone / be feruent in tyme / oute of tyme / rebuke blame / reproue / exhorte with all lenite softnes and doctryne. For the tyme shall come when men will not suffer nor abyde the trw doctrine / but aftir their owne voluptuouse lustes and desyers thei shall heap vnto them selues techers / euen them which mustetykle their eares / and shall auerte their eares from t
                  •
               e trwth / euen vnto vayne fables shall thei be conuerted. These wordis without dowte had not that diuine breste and godlye herte / pronownced with so greate feruencye and feruent affect / but that he knew it right wel / that that same doctryne which himselfe with also the mother apostles had preched and delyuered to the chirches in writing / was iust / perfit / and sufficiēt / & the innumerable chirches now constituted welnighe thorow oute

all the worlde to be trwe and perfit full chirches. Wherfore these same fewe institucions muste nedis be sufficient for the congregacions with which as necessarye doctrynes the lorde wold instructe his chosen and not onerate and ouerburden them / yea and that euē for this entent / that we shuld not nowe be euer in lerning / neuer comen to knowlege of the trwth. For all these thingis ar certayne / in a iust litle nowmber / yea and euē the most easyest lessons thorow christes helpe / so longe as we ceasse not from owr office and applye owr callinge.
            Furthermore / leste anyman complayn saying these owr sayinges to be to skant & initof vnfinisshed / it shall be necessary to expres some of these thinges more at large that it may be manyfest vnto almen / vs to haue sufficienly in these fewe principals / all thinges pertayning vnto the perfecciō and fulfilling of the chirche. The doctrine of the apostles / the preching of the trowth / the worde of the Lorde / the holye scripture or gospell of Iesu christe / obtayneth the fyrste place in these sayd principals.What ar comp̄
                  hended in these pncipalles. For it prescribeth this thing / the lawes of lyffe to be moste absolute and ꝑfit: this place techeth / it rebuketh / it deiecteth and casteth downe and lifteth vp agene

heuey myndis / it exhortethe / it counforteh / it threateneth / it bendeth and menaceth and decreeth punisshmēts / it setteth forth rewardes both of god and man / and to be short / all diuine and humane thingis / ecclesiastik and polityk / yea all the partes of owr lyffe / all ages and all offices it informeth and instituteth most plentuously / and perfitly yea and it absolueth and maketh them all perfit and ful / nothing wāting. This witnesseth Paul the moste wysest in the lawe / writing to Timothe / saing. Thou / see that thou standeste faste and perseuere in those thingis whiche thou lernedst & which ar cōmitted vnto the / knowing of whom thou haste lerned them / and that from thy childhod thou hast knowne the holy letters which may make the wyse & perfit vnto thy saluacion thorowe faith which is in Christe Iesu. For the hole and ꝑfit scripture godly inspired is profitable vnto teching and lerning / to rebuke / to correck to institute / and enstruct / in all good works that anye man of god may be entire perfit & redye vnto euery good worke.
            Also the worde of the lorde / in a maner and as farre as it perteineth vnto vs / is idle wā
               tinge her frute and operacion / excepte there be mē that will exercyse / stere vp & whett it / 

in tyme and place / applyinge and layinge it vnto men / teaching it / ernestly prouoking it settinge it forthe at lybertye and defende it. And here haue the mynisters of the chirche their place / & cheifly the techers of the trwth the goydes of the congregacions / the interpretours of scripturs / prechers / the masters of lyuing & good maners. For as miche therfore / that there is noman sodenly full made / nor borne a perfit artificer: the chirche muste nedis haue scolis / scolis (I saye) in which tongues / artes / liberall disciplines / but yet in a sobriete and mean / but cheifly the holy institucion & godly bringing vp of children be delyuered and taught religiously vnto the disciples which may be here aftir apoynted and promoued vnto the ministracions of the chirche / and taught also them which ar apte vnto erudicion and wysedome. For that there were flourisshīg scoles or vniuersites as thei now call them / in the tyme of the apostles & so flourisshed longe aftir their dayes / Luke affirmeth the autour of this in the Actis cap. xiij. And Paul in the .i. pistle to the Corīthians in the .xix. cap. Also Eusebius in his ecclesiastik storye / and wother ecclesiastik writers witnesse the same. And out of these maner scoles / the moste faithfull / moste excercised

/ the godlyest / the moste eloquent men / & of moste experience and wysedome were euer calld vnto the ministracions / gouernāce and teching of the congregacions. Also whē it is so that in the chirche or congregacion in which doctrine flourissheth / this vngraciouse kocle / drake / and dernell also wyll growe vndere & preuely encrease / so that there will very many stourdye prowde rebelles budde and wexe rype / which as thei cā craftely fayne themselues faithfull / euen so do thei nothing worthei and correspondēt to faith. yea and thei will not sett a strawe by it if thei be taughte an .C. tymes and be rebuked neuer so openly and greuouslye. Netheles thei go forth stil in their mischeif synnes. Wherfore it is necessarye that the congregacions haue not onely their ministers and techers / but also their elderly sage wyse men / yea & the seclare magistrates to / whiche muste with the lawes bring into order and with disciplyne constrayne and bynde faste these contumate stifnecked vnshamelesse criminouse synners And these mynisters & magistrates it behoueth to be right good mē / holy / faithful / godly iuste / tēperate / sobre / stronge and constāt and siche as fere god / which bothe wyll and maye do their office and dewtye. And vnto

this pertayneth the eleccion and office of the seclare Magistrates / hitherto ꝑtayn the sūptuarye and penall lawes agenst eting surfetting dronkenes / superfluite / excesse / viciousnes rybaldrye / whorehunting / filthy comunicacion: also the lawes agenst aduonterers and whoremongers / and lawes of matrimonye iustely to be contracted / lawfullye to be kepte in reuerence and iustlye to be diuorsed lawes of the bringinge vp of children / of the pubyk iustice / of bying and sellinge or anye wother doingis / agenste thir euell deccate
                  •
                / false wares &c̄ / agenste vserars and corrupters and minisshers of coynes / of iugemētes of the pore and destitute nedye / orphanes & frendles to be defended / of tranquilite and publyk peace / agenste hyered batail and wages to corrupt men / lawes of beneficence almose and helpe of the pore and of the lawful vse of the goodes of the chirches. These thingis wold I incidently and as it were by the waye poynte men to breifly / concerning the doctrine of the apostles or of the trwth / and of the ministers therof / that is to saye / of the lerners / techers / professours / prechers and of the holy senate & sage counsell of the chirche. Of syngers quere men and their ecclesiastik songe / I can saye nothing taken out of

the institucion of the apostles. Paul commā
               deth his chirches to synge in spirit and mynde. Wherfore it is sufficient to the iuste chirche if with trwe faith thei offer thorow christe their pure prayers vnto the Lorde.
            As for the Sacraments S. Austen very godly and lernedly affirmed very fewe to be instituted of the Lord / euen Baptisme and the sacrament of thankes geuing / the moste easyest sewerly in their obseruacion and kepīg of them / but in sence and significacion moste noble and excellent. For thei cary no greate coste with them / nor yet no difficulty (I speke of the apostles sacramētes / and not of the popishe sacramēts) and in fewe wordis / thei haue no worldly shyning shewes and glytering vayne glorye. For all their vertew and strength consisteth of / and in their institucion and significacion. The faithfull saynts in the congregaciō ar iustifyed and absolued by faith onely / and not by sacramēts. For sacraments excercise and in a maner excite and stere vp faith▪ for thei ar visible accions instituted of the lorde / to the entent he might represent vnto vs his mysteries and giftis / and so testifye towarde vs his good wille / exrercise and whett owr faith / gather and binde vs to gither into owr religion / and to admonisshe

vs of owr offyce. As ye may see in Baptisme For that representeth vnto vs that it is he onely which wassheth vs from owr synnes / by it witnessing that he fauoureth vs / yea & that he will be owr god one alone for vs all sufficient. Howe oft so euer baptisme is geuē in the cōgregaciō / the faith of holy men is excercised. Besides that it gathereth and bringeth vs togither vtwardly into his peple / & warneth vs to mortifye & slaye owr carnall affectes / that dayly we mought dye with the Lorde and ryse agene with him into a newe life. Agene / in the Souper of the lorde / it is signified that the bodye and blode of owr lorde ar spent and laid forth for vs in the crosse to satisfye owr fathers iustice / and gyue more life to the beleuers. Wherfore / when the brede is raught vnto vs / which brede the lorde called as it were in signe and token or aftir the similitude and aftir the maner of speking appropriated to sacraments / his bodye a manifest token is geuen / that the Lord offred hīself all whol vnto vs that we mought haue owr fruicion and sighte of him in faith. And thus owr faith is excercised in that mystyk acciō. And as out of many graynis one loffe is made / & of manye grapes the liquor of wyne floweth forth: euen so ar we monisshed

of mutuall loue in the percepciō and receiuinge of the signes and sacramentes / and that with Christe and emong owr owne selues we be made one bodye / and to geue thā
               kis to christe owr deliuerer. This is dowtles the vse and forme of the sacraments / hauing nothinge which hitherto hath not bene proposed and setforth in the doctrine of the gospell / saue that it hath pleased the Lorde for our infirmite to haue to do with vs accordīg to owr capacite by these signes sacramētals as it were with visible wordes: and in a maner to laye before owr eyes the moste greate and excellente thingis / that thei mought be the more commēded praysed and accepted of euerye christen man: and so by the one sacrament to iniciate and professe (as they saye) the faithfull / oute of whose felowship he excluded not euen the infantes. And by the tother sacramēt for the waren peple to retayn in memorye the deathe of the sone of God. And thus ye see it moste manifeste / the vse of the sacraments to be moste playn and single moste holsome and most full of the most swetest frutes. Whiche vse many make it more thē ingrate and vnthankfull / by those their thornye spinose disputacions fonde questiōs and withe their skoldinge cauillacions and

sophisticall besye brawlynges.
            Of these thingis hitherto writē (I suppose) euery reader perceiueth / that we which glorie & reioyce in the gospell & name of christe / haue in fewe principales shewed all thingis which perteyne vnto the full perfecciō of the chirche / & therfore owr lorde with these fewe in no wise to haue onerated his chirche. For these fewe things / albeit of their nature thei be the moste diuyne and incomprehensyble / yet vnto the faithfull ar thei the moste easye and moste iocunde and ioyfull in thobseruacion and in the keping of them. Wherfore / what soeuer coste / what charge and burdens the congregacions this daye sustayne: with what soeuer lawes rytes ceremonies tradicions of men / apere thei neuer so comelye and decent (as thei saye) with what and how many soeuer decrees and disputacions the congregacions be yet snarled combred and clogged / nether of the Lorde / nor of the apostles / nor of non apostelyk men haue thei receiued them / but of the euill idle bellye burdens of the erthe / of the supersticiouse papistes / and of these couetuouse preistes and greadye bisshops / which as thei haue hitherto ben euer in lerning and neuer comē to the knowelege of the trweth / euen so playnlye haue they

thought and made godlynes to be lucre and to serue their insaciable lustes: of whom the apostle wrytinge to Timothe / sayth. Auoid from these persons which be of siche couetuouse condicions and abhominable lyuinge. Cast of therfore (oh christē reder) these their importable burdēs of heuey vnprofitfble supersticiouse ceremonies / whiche to ease you thei will not once put forthe their fynger to bere them their selues / which burdēs in that (as Paul sayth) thei punisshe the bodye / thei apere to haue some vtwarde holynes / & yet ar thei with out all honour & godlines / euen their rytes & choise of meates to fede the flesshely lustes of their bellyes.Collo. ij And putt your neckes vnder the swete yoke of Chryst / and submitte your shulders vnder his light burdens (light it is that loue bereth) that as we be lyke Christe in gladlye suffrering / so we may be lyke him in glorye / vnto the whiche / he with the father / and his moste holye spririt / bringe vs all. Amen.
