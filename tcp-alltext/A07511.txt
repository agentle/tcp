            A Trick to catch the old one.
            
               Enter Witt-good a Gentleman, ſolus.
            
            
               Witt-good.
               
                  ALL's gone! ſtill thou'rt a Gentleman, that's all; but a poore one, that's nothing: What Milke brings thy Meadowes forth now? where are thy goodly Vp-lands and thy Downe-lands, all ſunck into that little pitte Lecherie? why ſhould a Gallant pay but two ſhillings for his Ordnary that nouriſhes him, and twenty times two for his Brothell that conſumes him? but where's Long-acre? in my Vncles conſcience, which is 3. yeares voyage about; he that ſetts out vpon his conſcience, nere finds the way home againe, he is either ſwallowed in the quick-ſands of Law-quillits, or ſplits vpō the Piles of a Praemunire; yet theſe old Foxe-braind—and oxe-browde Vncles, haue ſtill defences for their Auarice, and Apologies for their practiſes, and will thus greete our follyes.
               
                  Hee that doth his youth expoſe,
                  To Brothell, drinke, and danger,
                  Let him that is his neereſt Kinne,
                  Cheate him before a ſtranger.
               
               And that's his Vncle, 'tis a principle in Vſury; I dare not viſit the Cittie, there I ſhould bee too ſoone viſited, by that horrible plague my Debts, and by that meanes I looſe a Virgins loue, her portion and her Vertues, well, how ſhould a man liue now, that ha's no liuing; hum? why are there not a million of men in the world, that onely ſoiourne vpon their braine, and make their wittes their Mercers; and am I but one amongſt that Million and cannot thriue vpon't; any Trick out of the compaſſe of Lawe now, would come happily to me.
            
            
               Enter Curtizan.
            
               Curt.
               My loue.
            
            
               
               Wit.
               My lothing; haſt thou beene the ſecret conſumption of my purſe? and now comſt to vndo my laſt meanes, my wits? wilt leaue no vertue in me and yet thou nere the better? hence Curtizan, round webd Tarantula.
               
               That dryeſt the Roſes in the cheekes of youth.
            
            
               Cur.
               I haue beene true vnto your pleaſure, and all your lands thrice rackt, was neuer worth the Iewell which I prodigally gaue you, my virginity;
               Lands morgag'd may returne and more eſteemde,
               But honeſty once pawnd, is nere redeemd.
            
            
               Wit.
               For giue I do thee wrong,
               To make thee ſinne, and then to chid thee fort.
            
            
               Cur.
               I know I am your loathing now, farewell.
            
            
               Wit.
               Stay beſt inuention,—ſtay.
            
            
               Cur.
               I that haue beene the ſecret conſumption of your purſe ſhall I ſtay now to vndo your laſt meanes, your witts? hence Currizan away.
            
            
               Wit.
               I prethee, make me not mad at my owne weapon, ſtay, (a thing few women can do I know that, and therefore they had need weare ſtayes;) be not contrary, doſt loue me?
               Fate has ſo caſt it that all my meanes I muſt deriue from thee.
            
            
               Cur.
               From me! be happy then,
               What lies within the power of my performance,
               Shall be commanded of thee.
            
            
               Wit.
               Spoke like an honeſt drab ifaith, it may proue ſom-thing what Trick is not an Embrion at firſt, vntil a perfect ſhape come ouer it.
            
            
               Cur.
               Come I muſt helpe you where abouts left you,
               Ile proceed.
               Tho you beget, tis I muſt helpe to breed,
               Speake what iſt, Ide faine conceaue it.
            
            
               Wit.
               So, ſo, ſo, thou ſhall preſently take the name and forme vpon thee of a rich country widdow foure hundred a yeare valiant, in Woods, in Bullocks, in Barnes and in Rye-ſtacks, weele to London▪ and to my couetous Vncle.
            
            
               
               Curt.
               I begin to applaud thee, our States beeing both deſperate, they' are ſoone reſolute, but how for horſes?
            
            
               Witt.
               Maſſe that's true, the Ieſt will bee of ſome continuance, let mee ſee, Horſes now, a bottes on em; Stay, I haue acquaintance with a madde Hoſte, neuer yet Bawde to thee, I haue rinzde the whoreſons gums in Mull-ſack many a time and often, put but a good Tale into his eare now, ſo it come off cleanely, and there's Horſe and man for vs I dare warrant thee.
            
            
               Curt.
               Arme your wittes then ſpeedily, there ſhall want nothing in mee, eyther in behauiour, diſcourſe or faſhion, that ſhall diſcredit your entended purpoſe.
               I will ſo art-fully diſguiſe my wants,
               And ſet ſo good a courage on my ſtate,
               That I will be beleeued.
            
            
               Witt.
               Why then all's furniſht; I ſhall goe nigh to catch that olde Foxe mine Vncle, tho hee make but ſome amends for my vndooing, yet there's ſome comfort in't — hee cannot otherwiſe chooſe (tho it bee but in hope to coozen mee agen) but ſupply any haſtie want that I bring to towne with mee, the Deuice well and cunningly carryed, the name of a riche Widdow, and foure hundred a yeare in good earth, will ſo coniure vp a kinde of Vſurers loue in him to mee, that hee will not onely deſire my preſence, which at firſt ſhall ſcarce bee granted him, Ile keepe off a purpoſe, but I ſhall finde him ſo officious to deſerue, ſo ready to ſupply, I know the ſtate of an old mans affection ſo well, if his Nephew bee poore indeed, why hee letts God alone with him, but if hee be once rich, then heele bee the firſt man that helpes him.
            
            
               Curt.
               Tis right the world, for in theſe dayes an olde mans loue to his kindred, is like his kindneſſe to his wife, 'tis alwayes done before hee comes at it.
            
            
               Witt.
               I owe thee for that Ieſt, bee gone, here's all my wealth; prepare thy ſelfe, away? Ile to mine Hoſte withall poſſible haſt, and with the beſt Art, & moſt profitable forme, powre the ſweet

circumſtance into his eare, which ſhall haue the gift to turne all the waxe to hunny; how no; oh the right worſhipful Seniors of our Country —
            
            
               1.
               Whoſe that;
            
            
               2.
               Oh the common Rioter, take no note of him.
            
            
               Witg.
               You will not ſee me now, the comfort is ere it be long you will ſcarce ſee your ſelues.
            
            
               1.
               I wonder how hee breathes, ha's conſum'd all vpon that Curtizan?
            
            
               2.
               We haue heard ſo much.
            
            
               1
               You have heard all truth, his Vncle and my Brother, haue beene theſe three yeares mortall Aduerſaries. Two old tough ſpirits, they ſeldome meete but fight, or quarrell when tis calmeſt;
               I thinke their anger bee the very fire
               That keepes their age aliue:
            
            
               2.
               What was the quarrell ſir?
            
            
               1.
               Faith about a purchaſe, fetching ouer a yong heire; Maiſter Hoord my brother hauing waſted much time in beating the bargayne, what did me old Lucre▪
                   but as his conſcience mou'd him, knowing the poore Gentleman▪ ſtept in betweene e'm and couzned him himſelfe.
            
            
               2.
               And was this all ſir:
            
            
               1.
               This was e'en it ſir, yet for all this I know no reaſon but the match might go forward betwixt his wiues Sonne and my Neece, what tho there bee a diſſention betweene the two olde men, I ſee no reaſon it ſhould put a difference betweene the two yonger, tis as naturall for old folkes to fall out, as for yong to fall in? A ſcholler comes a wooing to my Neece, well, hee's wiſe, but he's poore, her Sonne comes a wooing to my Neece, well, hees a foole, but hees rich —
            
            
               2.
               I marry ſir?
            
            
               1.
               Pray now is not a rich foole better then a poore Philoſopher.
            
            
               2.
               One would think ſo yfaith?
            
            
               1.
               She now remaines at London with my brother her ſecond

Vncle, to learne faſhions, practiſe Muſicke, the voyce betweene her lips, and the violl betweene her legges, ſhee'le bee fitt for a conſort very ſpeedily, a thouſand good pound is her portion, if ſhe marry, weele ride vp and be merry,—
            
            
               3.
               A match, if it be a match?
               Exeunt.
            
            
               Enter at one doore, Witt-good, at the other Hoſt.
            
               Wit.
               Mine Hoſt?
            
            
               Hoſt.
               Young maiſter Wit-good.
               
            
            
               Wit,
               I haue beene laying all the Towne for thee.
            
            
               Hoſt.
               Why what's the newes Bully-Hadland?
            
            
               Witt.
               What Geldings are in the houſe of thine owne? anſwer me to that firſt.
            
            
               Hoſt.
               Why man, why?
            
            
               Witt.
               Marke mee what I ſay, Ile tell thee ſuch a tale in thine eare, that thou ſhalt truſt mee ſpite of thy teeth, furniſh me with ſome money, wille, nille, and ride vp with mee thy ſelfe Contra voluntatem et profeſſion em.
               
            
            
               Hoſt.
               How: let me ſee this trick, and Ile ſay thou haſt more
               Arte then a Coniurer.
            
            
               Wit.
               Dooſt thou ioy in my aduancement?
            
            
               Hoſt.
               Do I loue Sack and Ginger?
            
            
               Wit.
               Comes my proſperitie deſiredly to thee?
            
            
               Hoſt.
               Come forfeitures to a Vſurer, fees to an officer, punkes to an Hoſte, and Pigs to a Parſon deſiredly? why then la.
            
            
               Wit
               Will the report of a Widdow of foure hundred a yeare boye, make thee leape, and ſing, and dance, and come to thy place agen.
            
            
               Hoſt.
               Wilt thou command me now? I am thy ſpirit, coniure me into any ſhape.
            
            
               Wit.
               I ha brought her from her friends, turnde backe the Horſes by a ſlight, not ſo much as one amongſt her ſixe men, goodly large Yeomanly fellowes, will ſhee truſt with this her purpoſe: by this light all vnmand; regardleſſe of her ſtate, neglectfull of vaine-glorious ceremonie, all for my loue; oh 'tis a

fine little voluble toung mine Hoſte, that wins a widdow.
            
            
               Hoſt.
               No 'tis a toung with a great T my boye that winnes a widdow.
            
            
               Witt.
               Now ſir, the caſe ſtands thus, good mine Hoſt, if thou lou'ſt my happineſſe aſſiſt me.
            
            
               Hoſt.
               Command all my beaſts ith houſe.
            
            
               Witt.
               Nay thats not all neither, prethee take truce with thy ioy, and liſten to mee, thou know'ſt I haue a wealthy Vncle i'th Citty, ſome-what the wealthier by my follyes; the report of this fortune well and cunningly carried, might be a meanes to drawe ſome goodneſſe from the Vſuring Raſcall, for I haue put her in hope already of ſome eſtate that I haue eyther in land or money: now if I be found true in neither, what may I expect but a ſuddaine breach of our loue, vtter diſſolution of the match, and confuſion of my fortunes for euer.
            
            
               Hoſt.
               Wilt thou but truſt the managing of thy buſineſſe with me?
            
            
               Witt.
               With thee? why will I deſire to thriue in my purpoſe? will I hugge foure hundred a yeare? I that know the miſery of nothing? will that man wiſh a riche widdow, that has nere a hole to put his head in? with thee mine Hoſte, why beleeue it, ſooner with thee then with a Couy of Counſellors?
            
            
               Hoſt.
               Thanke you for your good report yfaith ſir, and if I ſtand you not inſteed, why then let an Hoſte come off Hic & haec hoſtis, a deadly enemie to Dice, Drinke, and Venery; come where's this widdow?
            
            
               Witt.
               Hard at Parke-end.
            
            
               Host.
               Ile be her Seruing-man for once.
            
            
               Witt.
               Why there wee let off together, keepe full time, my thoughts were ſtriking then iuſt the ſame number.
            
            
               Host.
               I knew't, ſhall we then ſee our merry dayes agen?
            
            
               Witt.
               Our merry nights—which nere ſhall bee more ſeene.
            
            Exeunt.
            
               
               Enter at ſeuerall doores, old Lucre, and old Hoord, Gentlemen comming betweene them, to pacifie 'em.
            
            
               Lampr.
               Nay good Maiſter Lucre, and you Maiſter Hoord▪
                   anger is the winde which you▪re both too much troubled with all.
            
            
               Hoord.
               Shall my aduerſary thus dayly afront mee, ripping vp the old wound of our malice, which three Summers could not cloſe vp, into which wound the very ſight of him, drops ſcalding Lead inſteed of Balſamum.
            
            
               Luc.
               Why Hoord, Hoord, Hoord, Hoord, Hoord; may I not paſſe in the ſtate of quietneſſe to mine owne houſe, anſwer mee to that▪ before witneſſe, and why? Ile referre the cauſe to honeſt euen-minded Gentlemen, or require the meere indifferences of the Lawe, to decide this matter, I got the purchaſe, true; was't not any mans caſe? yes, will a wiſe-man ſtand as a Bawd, whilſt another wipes his noſe of the bargaine, no, I anſwer no in that caſe.
            
            
               Lampr.
               Nay ſweet Maiſter Lucre.
               
            
            
               Hoord.
               Was it the part of a friend: no, rather of a Iew, marke what I ſay, when I had beaten the buſh to the laſt bird, or as I may terme it, the price to a pound, then like a cunning Vſurer to come in the euening of the bargaine, and gleane all my hopes in a minute, to enter as it were at the back-doore of the purchaſe, for thou nere camſt the right way by it.
            
            
               Luc.

               Vpbraidſt thou me with Nephew? is all imputation laid vpon me? what acquaintance haue I with his follyes, if hee riott, 'tis hee muſt want it, if hee ſurfet, 'tis hee muſt feele it:

if he Drab it, 'tis he muſt lye by't, what's this to me?

               Heard of him? why man he that ha's loſt both his eares, may heare of him, a famous infamous Trampler of time; his owne phraze: note him well, that Dampit ſirrah, hee in the vneuen Beard, and the Serge cloake, is the moſt notorious, vſuring, blaſphemous, Atheiſticall, Brothell, vomiting raſcall, that wee haue in theſe latter times now extant, whoſe firſt beginning was the ſtealing of a maſtie Dogge from a Farmers houſe.
            
            
               Hoſt.
               Hee lookt as if hee would obay the commandement well, when he began firſt with ſtealing.
            
            
               Witt.
               True, the next Towne he came at, hee ſet the Dogs together by'th eares.

               Enquire of him? if I might counſell thee, thou ſhouldſt nere trouble thy ſelfe furder, enquire of him of no more but of mee, Ile fit thee?

               Wife.
               I hope I am not to learne ſir, to entertaine a widdowe, tis not ſo long ago ſince I was one my ſelfe?

               I thinke ſo?

               No, good Maiſter Wit-good,

               Wit.
               I know you haue beene kinde, how euer now either by wrong report, or falſe incitement your gentleneſſe is iniurde, in ſuch a ſtate as this a man cannot want foes.
