            TO THE READER.
            
               THis vnhappie controuersie, about the receiued ceremonies and discipline of the Church of England, which hath so long time withdrawne so many of her Ministers from their principall worke, and imployed their studies in contentious oppositions: hath by the vnnaturall growth and daungerous fruites thereof, made knowne to the world, that it neuer receiued blessing from the father of peace. For whose experience doth not finde, what confusion of order, and breach of the sacred bond of loue hath sprung from this dissention; how it hath rent the bodie of the Church into diuers parts, and diuided her people into diuers Sects; how it hath taught the sheepe to despise their pastors, and alienated the Pastors from the loue of their flockes: how it hath strengthened the irreligious in their impieties, and hath raised the hopes of the sacrilegious deuourers of the remaines of Christs patrimony; and giuen way to the common aduersary of Gods truth and our prosperity, to grow great in our land without resistance; who seeth not how it hath distracted the mindes of the multitude, and shaken their faith, and scandalized their weakeness, and hath generally killed the very hart of true pietie and religious deuotion, by changing our zeale towards Christes glory, into the fire of enuie and malice, and hart-burning, and Zeale to euery mans priuate cause? This is the summe of all the gaines which the tedious contentions of so many yeares haue brought in, by the ruine of Christs kingdome, the encrease of Satans, partly in superstition, & partly in impietie. So much better were it in these our dwellings of peace, to endure any inconuenience whatsoeuer in the outward frame, then in desire of alteration, thus to set the whole house on fire. Which moued the religious hart of this learned writer, in Zeale of Gods truth, and in compassion to his Church, the mother of vs all, which gaue vs both the first breath of spirituall life, and from her breasts hath fed vs vnto this whatsoeuer measure of growth we haue in Christ, to stand vp and take vpon him a generall defence both of her selfe, and of her established lawes; and by force of demonstration, so farre as the nature of the present matter could beare, to make knowne to the world, and these oppugners of her, that all those bitter accusations laid to her charge, are not the faultes of her lawes and orders, but either their owne mistakes in the misvnderstanding, or the abuses of men in the ill execution of them. A worke subiect to manifold reprehensions and oppositions, and not sutable to his soft and milde disposition, desirous of a quiet priuate life, wherein hee might bring forth the fruits of peace in peace. But the loue of God and of his countrey, whose greatest daunger grew from this diuision, made his hart hot within him, and at length the fire kindled, and amongst many other most reuerend and learned men, he also presumed to speake with his pen. And the rather, because he sawe that none of these ordinary obiections of partialities could eleuate the authoritie of his writing, who alwayes affected a priuate state, and neither enioyed nor expected any the least dignitie in our Church. What admirable height of learning, and depth of iudgement dwelled within the lowly minde of this true humble man, great in all wise mens eyes, except his owne; with what grauitie and maiestie of speach his tongue and pen vttered heauenly mysteries, whose eyes in the humility of his hart were alwayes cast downe to the ground▪ how all things that proceeded from him

were breathed as from the spirit of loue, as if he like the bird of the holy Ghost, the Doue, had wanted gall; let them that knew him not in his person, iudge by the these liuing Images of his soule, his writings. For out of these, euen those who otherwise agree not with him in opinion, do affoord him the testimony of a milde and a louing spirit: and of his learning what greater proofe can we haue then this, that his writings are most admired by those who themselues do most excell in iudicious learning, and by them the more often they are read, the more highly they are extolled and desired. Which is the cause of this second edition of his former bookes, and that without any addition or diminution whatsoeuer. For who will put a pencile to such a worke, from which such a workeman hath taken his? There is a purpose of setting forth the three last books also, their fathers Posthumi. For as in the great declining of his bodie, spent out with study, it was his ordinary petition to almightie God, that if he might liue to see the finishing of these bookes, then Lord let thy seruant depart in peace (to vse his owne words) so it pleased God to grant him his desire. For he liued till he sawe them perfected; and though like Rachel he dyed as it were in the trauell of them, and hastened death vpon himselfe, by hastening to giue them life: yet he held out to behold with his eyes these partus ingenii, these Beniamins, sonnes of his right hand, though to him they were Benonies, sonnes of paine and sorrowe. But some euill disposed mindes, whether of malice, or couetousnesse, or wicked blinde Zeale, it is vncerteine, as if they had beene Egyptian Mid-wiues, as soone as they were borne, and their father dead, smothered them, and by conueying away the perfect Copies, left vnto vs nothing but certaine olde vnperfect and mangled draughts, dismembred into peeces, and scattered like Medeas Abyrtus, no fauour, no grace, not the shadowes of themselues almost remaining in them. Had the father liued to see them brought forth thus defaced, he might rightfully haue named them Benonies, the sonnes of sorrowe. But seeing the importunities of many great and worthy persons will not suffer them quietly to dye and to be buried, it is intended that they shall see them as they are. The learned and iudicious eye will yet perhaps delight it selfe in beholding the goodly lineaments of their well set bodies, and in finding out some shadowes and resemblances of their fathers face. God grant that as they were with their bretheren dedicated to the Church for messengers of peace: so in the strength of that little breath of life that remaineth in them, they may prosper in their worke; and by satisfying the doubtes of such as are willing to learne, may helpe to giue an end to the calamities of these our ciuill wars.

            A Preface. To them that seeke (as they tearme it) the reformation of Lawes and orders Ecclesiasticall, in the Church of ENGLAND.
            
               THough for no other cause,The cause and occasion of handling these things: and what might be wished in them for whose sakes so much paine is taken. yet for this; that posteritie may knowe wee haue not loosely through silence permitted thinges to passe away as in a dreame, there shall be for mens information extant thus much concerning the present state of the Church of God established amongst vs, and their carefull endeuour which would haue vpheld the same. At your hands beloued in our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ (for in him the loue which we beare vnto all that would but seeme to be borne of him, it is not the sea of your gall and bitternes that shall euer drowne) I haue no great cause to looke for other then the selfesame portion & lot, which your maner hath bene hitherto to lay on them that concur not in opinion and sentence with you. But our hope is, that the God of peace shal (notwithstanding mans nature too impatient of contumelious maledictiō) inable vs quietly and euē gladly to suffer al things, for that worke sake which we couet to perform. The wonderful zeale and feruour wherewith ye haue withstood the receiued orders of this Church, was the first thing which caused me to enter into consideration, whether (as all your published bookes and writings peremptorily maintain) euery Christian man fearing God, stand bound to ioyne with you for the furtherance of that which ye tearme the Lords Discipline. Wherin

I must plainly confesse vnto you, that before I examined your sundrie declarations in that behalfe, it could not settle in my head to thinke, but that vndoubtedly such nūbers of otherwise right wel affected & most religiously enclined minds, had some maruellous reasonable inducementes which led thē with so great earnestnes that way. But when once, as near as my slender abilitie would serue, I had with trauell & care performed that part of the Apostles aduise & counsel in such cases, whereby he willeth to try al things; and was come at the length so far, that there remained onely the other clause to be satisfied, wherein he concludeth that what good is must bee held: there was in my poore vnderstanding no remedie, but to set downe this as my finall resolute perswasion; Surely the present forme of Church gouernment which the lawes of this land haue established, is such, as no lawe of God, nor reason of man hath hitherto bene alleaged, of force sufficient to proue they do ill, who to the vttermost of their power withstand the alteration thereof: Contrariwise, The other which instead of it we are required to accept, is only by error & misconceipt named the ordinance of Iesus Christ, no one proofe as yet brought forth, whereby it may clearely appeare to be so in very deede. The explication of which two thinges I haue here thought good to offer into your owne hands: hartily beseeching you euen by the meeknesse of Iesus Christ, whome I trust ye loue; that, as ye tender the peace and quietnesse of this Church, if there bee in you that gracious humilitie which hath euer bene the crowne and glory of a christianly disposed minde, if your owne soules, hearts and consciences, (the sound integritie whereof can but hardly stand with the refusall of truth in personall respects) be, as I doubt not but they are, things most deare and precious vnto you, Let not the faith which ye haue in our Lord Iesus Christ, be blemished with partialities,
               Ia. 2.1. regard not who it is which speaketh, but waigh onely what is spoken. Thinke not that ye reade the wordes of one, who bendeth himselfe as an aduersary against the truth which ye haue alreadie embraced; but the words of one, who desireth euen to embrace together with you the selfe same truth, if it be the truth; and for that cause (for no other God hee knoweth) hath vndertaken the burthensome labour of this painefull kinde of conference. For the plainer accesse whereunto, let it bee lawfull for mee to rip vp to the very bottome how and by whom your Discipline was planted, at such time as this age wee liue in began to make first triall thereof.
            
               2. A founder it had, whome, for mine owne part,The first establishment of new discipline by M. Caluins industry in the Church of Geneua: and the beginning of strife about it amongst our selues. I thinke incomparably the wisest man that euer the french Church did enioy, since the houre it enioyed him. His bringing vp was in the studie of the Ciuill Lawe. Diuine knowledge he gathered not by hearing or reading so much, as by teaching others. For though thousands were debters to him, as touching knowledge in that kinde; yet he to none but onely to God, the author of that most blessed fountaine the booke of life, and of the admirable dexteritie of wit, together with the helpes of other learning which were his guides: till being occasioned to leaue Fraunce, he fell at the length vpon Geneua: Which Citie, the Bishop and Cleargie thereof had a little before (as some doe affirme) forsaken, being of likelihood frighted with the peoples sudden attempt for abolishment of popish religiō: the euent of which enterprise they thought it not safe for themselues to wait for in that place. At the comming of Caluin thither, the forme of their ciuill regiment was popular, as it continueth at this day: neither King, nor Duke, nor Noble man of any authoritie or power ouer them, but officers chosen by the people yearely out of themselues, to order all things with publique consent. For spirituall gouernment, they had no lawes at all agreed vpon, but did what the pastors of their soules by perswasion could win them vnto. Caluin being admitted one of their Preachers & a diuinitie Reader amongst them, considered how dangerous it was that the whole estate of that Church should hang stil on so slender a thred, as the liking of an ignorant multitude is, if it haue power to change whatsoeuer it selfe listeth. Wherefore taking vnto him two of the other ministers for more countenance of the action, (albeit the rest were all against it) they moued, and in the end perswaded with much adoe, the people to bind themselues by solemne oath, first neuer to admit the Papacie amongst them againe; and secondly, to liue in obedience vnto such orders concerning the exercise of their religion, and the forme of their ecclesiasticall gouernment, as those their true and faithfull Ministers of Gods word had agreeablie to Scripture set downe for that end and purpose. When these thinges began to bee put in vre, the people also (what causes mouing them thereunto, themselues best know) began to repent them of that they had done, and irefully to champe vpon the bit they had taken into their mouthes, the rather for that they grew by meanes of this innouation into dislike with some Churches neare about them, the benefite of whose good friendship their state could not well lacke. It was the manner of those times (whether through mens desire to enioy alone the glory of their owne enterprises, or else because the quicknesse of their occasions required present dispatch,)

so it was, that euery particular Church did that within it selfe, which some fewe of their owne thought good, by whome the rest were all directed. Such nūber of Churches thē being, though free within themselues, yet smal, commō conference before hand might haue eased them of much aftertrouble. But a greater inconuenience it bred, that euery later endeuoured to bee certaine degrees more remoued from conformitie with the Church of Rome, then the rest before had bene: whereupon grew maruellous great dissimilitudes, and by reason thereof, iealousies, hartburnings, iarres and discords amongst them. Which notwithstanding might haue easily bene preuented, if the orders which each Church did thinke fit and conuenient for it selfe, had not so peremptorily bene established vnder that high commaunding forme, which tendered them vnto the people, as things euerlastingly required by the law of that Lord of Lords, against whose statutes there is no exception to be taken. For by this meane it came to passe, that one Church could not but accuse & condemne another of disobedience to the wil of Christ, in those things where manifest difference was betweene them: whereas the selfesame orders allowed, but yet established in more warie and suspense maner, as being to stand in force till God should giue the opportunitie of some general cōference what might be best for euery of them afterwards to doe; this I say had both preuented all occasion of iust dislik
                  •
                which others might take, and reserued a greater libertie vnto the authors themselues of entring into farther consultatiō afterwards. Which though neuer so necessary they could not easily now admit, without some feare of derogation from their credit: and therfore that which once they had done, they became for euer after resolute to maintaine. Caluin therfore & the other two his associats stiffely refusing to administer the holy Communion to such as would not quietly without contradiction and murmur submit themselues vnto the orders which their solemne oath had bound them to obey, were in that quarell banished the towne. A fewe yeares after (such was the leuitie of that people) the places of one or two of their Ministers being fallen voyde, they were not before so willing to be rid of their learned Pastor, as now importunate to obtaine him againe from them who had giuen him entertainment, and which were loath to part with him, had not vnresistable earnestnes bene vsed. One of the towne ministers that sawe in what manner the people were bent for the reuocation of Caluin, gaue him notize of their affection in this sort. The Senate of two hundred being assembled,
               Epist. Cal. 24. 
               they all craue Caluin. The next day a generall conuocation. They crye in like sort againe all: VVe will haue Caluin that good and learned man Christs Minister. This, saith he, when

I vnderstood I could not choose but praise God, nor was I able to iudge otherwise, then that this was the Lordes doing,
               Luc. 20.17. 
               and that it was maruellous in our eyes, and That the stone which the builders refused, was now made the head of the corner. The other two whom they had throwne out (together with Caluin) they were content should enioy their exile. Many causes might lead them to bee more desirous of him. First, his yeelding vnto them in one thing, might happily put them in hope, that time would breed the like easines of condescending further vnto them. For in his absence he had perswaded them, with whome he was able to preuaile, that albeit himselfe did better like of common bread to bee vsed in the Eucharist, yet the other they rather should accept, then cause any trouble in the Church about it. Againe, they saw that the name of Caluin waxed euery day greater abroad, and that together with his fame their infamy was spread, who had so rashly and childishly eiected him. Besides it was not vnlikely but that his credite in the world, might many wayes stand the poore towne in great stead: as the truth is, their ministers forrein estimation hitherto hath bene the best stake in their hedge. But whatsoeuer secret respects were likely to moue them, for contenting of their mindes Caluin returned (as it had bene an other Tully) to his olde home. He ripely considered how grosse a thing it were for men of his qualitie, wise and graue men, to liue with such a multitude, and to be tenants at will vnder them, as their ministers, both himselfe and others, had bene. For the remedie of which inconuenience, hee gaue them plainely to vnderstand, that if he did become their teacher againe, they must be content to admit a complet forme of discipline, which both they and also their pastors should now be solemnely sworne to obserue for euer after. Of which discipline the maine and principall partes were these: A standing ecclesiasticall Court to be established: perpetuall Iudges in that Court to be their ministers; others of the people annually chosen (twise so many in number as they) to be iudges together with them in the same Court: these two sorts to haue the care of all mens manners, power of determining all kind of Ecclesiasticall causes, and authoritie to conuent, to controll, to punish, as farre as with excōmunication, whomsoeuer they should thinke worthy, none eyther small or great excepted, This deuise I see not how the wisest at that time liuing could haue bettered, if we duly consider what the present estate of Geneua did then require. For their Bishop and his Clergie being (as it is said) departed from them by moonelight, or howsoeuer, being departed; to choose in his roome any other Bishop, had beene a thing altogether impossible. And for their ministers to seeke that themselues alone might haue coerciue power ouer the whole Church, would perhaps

haue bene hardly construed at that time. But when so franke an offer was made, that for euery one minister there should be two of the people to sit and giue voyce in the Ecclesiasticall Consistory, what inconuenience could they easily find which themselues might not be able alwayes to remedy? Howbeit (as euermore the simpler sort are, euen when they see no apparant cause, iealous notwithstanding ouer the secret intents and purposes of wiser men) this proposition of his did somewhat trouble them. Of the Ministers themselues which had stayed behinde in the Citie when Caluin was gone, some, vpon knowledge of the peoples earnest intent to recall him to his place againe, had beforehand written their letters of submission, and assured him of their alleageance for euer after, if it should like him to harken vnto that publique suite. But yet misdoubting what might happen, if this discipline did goe forwarde; they obiected against it the example of other reformed Churches, liuing quietly and orderly without it. Some of chiefest place and countenance amongst the laitie professed with greater stomacke their iudgements, that such a discipline was little better then popish tyrannie disguised and tendered vnto them vnder a new forme. This sort, it may be, had some feare that the filling vp of the seates in the Consistorie, with so great a number of lay men, was but to please the mindes of the people, to the ende they might thinke their owne swaye somewhat; but when things came to triall of practise, their Pastors learning would bee at all times of force to ouerperswade simple men, who knowing the time of their owne Presidentship to bee but short, would alwayes stand in feare of their ministers perpetuall authoritie: and among the ministers themselues, one being so farre in estimation aboue the rest, the voyces of the rest were likely to be giuen for the most part respectiuely with a kinde of secret dependencie and awe: so that in shewe a maruellous indifferently composed Senate Ecclesiasticall was to gouerne, but in effect one onely man should, as the Spirite and soule of the residue, doe all in all. But what did these vaine surmises boote? Brought they were now to so straight an issue, that of two thinges they must choose one; namely, whether they would to their endlesse disgrace, with ridiculous lightnes, dismisse him, whose restitution they had in so impotent maner desired: or else condescende vnto that demaund, wherein hee was resolute eyther to haue it, or to leaue them. They thought it better to be somewhat hardly yoked at home, then for euer abroad discredited. Wherefore in the ende those orders were on all sides assented vnto:An. D▪ 1541. with no lesse alacritie of minde, then Cities vnable to holde out longer are wont to shewe, when they take conditions such as it liketh him to offer them which hath them in the narrow streightes of aduantage. Not

many yeares were ouerpassed, before these twice sworne men aduentured to giue their last and hotest assault to the fortresse of the same discipline, childishly graunting by comon consent of their whole Senate, & that vnder their towne seale, a relaxation to one Bertelier whom the Eldership had excommunicated; further also decreeing, with strange absurditie, that to the same Senate it should belong to giue finall iudgemēt in matter of excōmunication, and to absolue whom it pleased them; cleane contrary to their owne former deedes and oaths. The report of which decree being forth with brought vnto Caluin; Before (sayth he) this decree take place, either my bloud or banishment shall signe it. Againe two dayes before the Cōmunion should be celebrated, his speech was publiquely to like effect, Kill me if euer this hand do reach forth the things that are holy, to thē whom THE CHVRCH hath iudged despisers. Whereupon, for feare of tumult, the forenamed Bertelier was by his friends aduised for that time not to vse the liberty granted him by the Senate, nor to present himselfe in the Church, till they saw somewhat further what would ensue. After the Communion quietly ministred, and some likelihood of peaceable ending these troubles without any more ado, that very day in the afternoone, besides all mens expectation, concluding his ordinary sermon, he telleth them, that because he neither had learned nor taught to striue with such as are in authority, therefore (sayth he) the case so standing as now it doth, let me vse these words of the Apostle vnto you, I commend you vnto God & the word of his grace, and so bad them hartily all A dew. It sometimes commeth to passe, that the readiest way which a wise man hath to conquer, is to flie. This voluntarie and vnexpected mention of sudden departure, caused presently the Senate (for according to their woonted maner they still continued onely constant in vnconstancy) to gather themselues together, and for a time to suspend their own decree, leauing things to proceed as before, till they had heard the iudgement of foure Heluetian Cities concerning the matter which was in strife. This to haue done at the first before they gaue assēt vnto any order, had shewed some wit & discretion in thē: but now to do it, was as much as to say in effect, that they would play their parts on stage. Caluin therfore dispatcheth with all expedition his letters vnto some principall pastor in euery of those cities, crauing earnestly at their hands, to respect this cause as a thing whereupō the whole state of religion & piety in that church did so much depend, yt God & all good men were now ineuitably certaine to be trampled vnder foot, vnlesse those foure Cities by their good means might be brought to giue sentence with the ministers of Geneua, when the cause should be brought before them: yea so to giue it, that two things it might

effectually containe; the one an absolute approbation of the discipline of Geneua, as consonant vnto the word of God, without any cautions, qualifications, ifs or ands; the other an earnest admonition not to innouate or change the same. His vehemēt request herein as touching both points was satisfied. For albeit the sayd Heluetian Churches did neuer as yet obserue that discipline,Ep. 166. neuerthelesse the Senate of Geneua hauing required their iudgement concerning these three questions: First, after what manner, by Gods commaundement, according to the Scripture and vnspotted religion, excommunication is to be exercised: Secondly, whether it may not be exercised some other way then by the Consistorie: Thirdly, what the vse of their Churches was to do in this case: answer was returned from the sayd Churches, That they had heard already of those consistoriall lawes, and did acknowledge them to be godly ordinances drawing towards the prescript of the word of God, for which cause that they did not thinke it good for the Church of Geneua by innouation to change the same, but rather to keepe them as they were. Which aunswer, although not aunswering vnto the former demaunds, but respecting what Maister Caluin had iudged requisite for them to aunswere, was notwithstanding accepted without any further reply: in as much as they plainely saw, that when stomacke doth striue with wit, the match is not equall. And so the heat of their former contentions began to flake. The present inhabitants of Geneua, J hope, will not take it in euill part, that the faltinesse of their people heretofore, is by vs so farre forth layd open, as their owne learned guides and Pastors haue thought necessarie to discouer it vnto the world. For out of their bookes and writings it is that I haue collected this whole narration, to the end it might thereby appeare in what sort amongst them that discipline was planted, for which so much contention is raised amongst our selues. The reasons which mooued Caluin herein to be so earnest,Quod eam vrbem videret omnino his frenis indigere. was, as Beza himselfe testifieth, for that he saw how needfull these bridles were to be put in the iawes of that Citie. That which by wisedome he saw to be requisite for that people, was by as great wisedome compassed. But wise men are men, and the truth is truth. That which Caluin did for establishment of his discipline, seemeth more commendable, then yt which he taught for the countenancing of it established. Nature worketh in vs all a loue to our owne counsels. The contradiction of others is a fanne to inflame that loue. Our loue set on fire to maintaine that which once we haue done, sharpeneth the wit to dispute, to argue, and by all meanes to reason for it. Wherefore a maruaile it were if a man of so great capacitie, hauing such incitements to make him desirous of

all kind of furtherances vnto his cause, could espie in the whole Scripture of God nothing which might breed at the least a probable opinion of likelihood, that diuine authority it selfe was the same way somewhat inclinable. And all which the wit euen of Caluin was able from thence to draw, by sifting the very vtmost sentence and syllable, is no more then that certaine speeches there are which to him did seeme to intimate, that all Christian Churches ought to haue their Elderships indued with power of excommunication, and that a part of those Elderships euery where should be chosen out frō amongst the laitie after that forme which himselfe had framed Geneua vnto. But what argument are ye able to shew, whereby it was euer prooued by Caluin, that any one sentence of Scripture doth necessarily enforce these things, or the rest wherein your opinion concurreth with his against the orders of your owne Church? We should be iniurious vnto vertue it selfe, if we did derogate from them whom their industrie hath made great. Two things of principall moment there are which haue deseruedly procured him honour throughout the world: the one his exceeding paynes in composing the Institutions of Christian Religion; the other his no lesse industrious trauailes for exposition of holy Scripture according vnto the same institutions. In which two things who soeuer they were that after him bestowed their labour; he gayned the aduantage of preiudice against them, if they gaine said; and of glorie aboue them, if they consented. His writings published after the question about that discipline was once begunne, omit not any the least occasion of extolling the vse and singular necessitie thereof. Of what accompt the Maister of sentences was in the Church of Rome, the same and more amongest the Preachers of reformed Churches Caluin had purchased: so that the perfectest diuines were iudged they, which were skilfullest in Caluins writings. His bookes almost the very Canon to iudge both doctrine and discipline by French Churches, both vnder others abroad, and at home in their owne Countrey, all cast according vnto that mould which Caluin had made. The Church of Scotland in erecting the fabricke of their reformation tooke the selfe same paterne. Till at length the discipline, which was at the first so weake, that without the staffe of their approbation, who were not subiect vnto it themselues, it had not brought others vnder subiection; beganne now to challenge vniuersall obedience, and to enter into open conflict with those very Churches, which in desperate extremitie had bene relieuers of it. To one of those Churches which liued in most peaceable sort, and abounded as well with men for their learning in other professions singular, as also with diuines whose equals were not elsewhere to be found;

a Church ordered by Gualters discipline, and not by that which Geneua adoreth: vnto this Church, the Church of Heidelberge, there commeth one who crauing leaue to dispute publiquely, defendeth with open disdaine of their gouernement, that To a Minister with his Eldership power is giuen by the law of God to excommunicate whomsoeuer, yea euen kings and princes themselues. Here were the seedes sowne of that controuersie which sprang vp betweene Beza and Erastus about the matter of excommunication, whether there ought to be in all Churches an Eldership hauing power to excommunicate, and a part of that Eldership to be of necessitie certaine chosen out from amongest the laity for that purpose. In which disputation they haue, as to me it seemeth, deuided very equally the truth betweene them; Beza most truly maintaining the necessitie of excommunication; Erastus as truly the nonnecessitie of layelders to be ministers thereof. Amongest our selues, there was in King Edwards dayes some question moued by reason of a few mens scrupulositie touching certaine things. And beyond Seas, of them which fled in the dayes of Queene Mary, some contenting themselues abroad with the vse of their owne Seruice booke at home authorised before their departure out of the Realme; others liking better the Common prayer booke of the Church of Geneua translated; those smaller contentions before begun were by this meane somewhat increased. Vnder the happy raigne of her Maiesty which now is, the greatest matter a while contended for was the wearing of the Cap and Surplesse, till there came Admonitions directed vnto the high Court of Parliament, by men who concealing their names thought it glory inough to discouer their minds and affections, which now were vniuersally bent euen against all the orders and lawes wherein this Church is found vnconformable to the platforme of Geneua. Concerning the defendor of which admonitions, all that I meane to say is but this: There will come a time when three words vttered with charitie and meeknesse, shall receiue a farre more blessed reward, then three thousand volumes written with disdainefull sharpnes of wit. But the maner of mens writing must not alienate our hearts from the truth, if it appeare they haue the truth: as the followers of the same defendor do thinke he hath, and in that perswasion they follow him, no otherwise then himselfe doth Calvin, Beza, and others, with the like perswasion that they in this cause had the truth. We being as fully perswaded otherwise,By what meanes so many of the people are trained into the liking of that discipline. it resteth that some kind of tryall be vsed to find out which part is in error.
            3 The first meane whereby nature teacheth men to iudge good from euill as well in lawes as in other things, is the force of their owne discretion.

Hereunto therefore Saint Paule referreth oftentimes his owne speech to be considered of by them that heard him,1. Cor. 10, 13. 
               I speake as to them which haue vnderstanding, iudge ye what I say. Againe afterward,1. Cor. 1

               Iudge in your selues, is it comely that a woman pray vncouered? The exercise of this kind of iudgement our Sauiour requireth in the Iewes. In them of Berea the Scripture commendeth it. Finally whatsoeuer we do,Act,. 17.11. if our owne secret iudgement consent nor vnto it as fit and good to be done; the doing of it to vs is sinne, although the thing it selfe be allowable. Saint Paules rule therefore generally is, Let euery man in his owne minde be fully perswaded of that thing which he either alloweth or doth.
               Rom. 14.5. Some things are so familiar and plaine, that truth from falshood, and good from euill is most easily discerned in them, euen by men of no deepe capacitie. And of that nature, for the most part, are things absolutely vnto all mens saluation necessarie, either to be held or denied, either to be done or auoided. For which cause Saint Augustine acknowledgeth that they are not onely set downe, but also plainely set downe in Scripture: so that he which heareth or readeth, may without any great difficultie vnderstand. Other things also there are belonging (though in a lower degree of importance) vnto the offices of Christian men: which because they are more obscure, more intricate and hard to be iudged of, therefore God hath appointed some to spend their whole time principally in the studie of things diuine, to the end that in these more doubtfull cases, their vnderstanding might be a light to direct others. If the vnderstanding power or facultie of the soule,

               be (sayth the grand Phisitian) like vnto bodily sight▪ not of equall sharpnesse in all; what can be more conuenient, then that, euen as the darkesighted man is directed by the cleare about things visible, so likewise in matters of deeper discourse the wise in heart do shew the simple where his way lyeth? In our doubtfull cases of law, what man is there who seeth not how requisite it is, that professors of skill in that facultie be our directors? So it is in all other kinds of knowledge. And euen in this kind likewise the Lord hath himselfe appointed,Mal 2.7. that the Priests lips should preserue knowledge, and that other men should seeke the truth at his mouth, because he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts. Gregory Nazianzene offended at the peoples too great presumption in controlling the iudgement of them to whom in such cases they should haue rather submitted their owne,Greg. Naz. orat. qua se 
                     ••
                  cusat. seeketh by earnest intreatie to stay them within their bounds: Presume not ye that are sheepe to make your selues guides of them that should guide you, neither seeke ye to ouerskip the fold which they about you haue pitched. It sufficeth

for your part, if ye can well frame your selues to be ordered. Take not vpon you to iudge your selues, nor to make them subiect to your lawes who should be a law to you. For God is not a God of sedition and confusion,
               Matth. 15.14. 
               but of order and of peace. But ye will say that if the guides of the people be blind,Mal. 2.9. the common sort of men must not close vp their owne eyes and be led by the conduct of such; if the Priest be partiall in the law, the flocke must not therefore depart from the wayes of sincere truth, and in simplicitie yeeld to be followers of him for his place sake and office ouer them. Which thing, though in it selfe most true, is in your defence notwithstanding weake: because the matter, wherein ye thinke that yee see and imagine that your wayes are sincere, is of farre deeper consideration then any one amongest fiue hundred of you conceiueth. Let the vulgar sort amongst you know, that there is not the least branch of the cause wherin they are so resolute, but to the triall of it a great deale more appertaineth then their conceipt doth reach vnto. I write not this in disgrace of the simplest that way giuen; but I would gladly they knewe the nature of that cause wherein they thinke themselues throughly instructed and are not: by meanes whereof they daily run themselues,Iud ver. 10▪2.

               nt of the Apostles sentence against euill speakers as touching things wherein they are ignorant. If it be graunted a thing vnlawfull for priuate men, not called vnto publique consultation, to dispute which is the best state of ciuill Policie (with a desire of bringing in some other kind then that vnder which they already liue, for of such disputes I take it his meaning was;) if it be a thing confest that of such questions they cannot determine without rashnesse, in as much as a great part of them consisteth in speciall circumstances, and for one kind as many reasons may be brought as for another; is there any reason in the world, why they should better iudge what kind of regiment Ecclesiasticall is the fittest? For in the Ciuill state more insight, and in those affaires more experience a great deale must needes be graunted them, then in this they can possibly haue? When they which write in defence of your discipline,The author of the petition directed to her Maiestie p. 3. and commend it vnto the Highest not in the least cunning manner, are forced notwithstanding to acknowledge, that with whom the truth is they knowe not, they are not certaine; what certainty or knowledge can the multitude haue thereof? Waigh what doth mooue the common sort so much to fauour this innouation, and it shall soone appeare vnto you, that the force of particular reasons which for your seuerall opinions are alleaged, is a thing whereof the multitude neuer did, nor could so consider as to be there with wholly caried; but certaine generall inducements are vsed to make saleable your Cause in grosse: and when once men haue cast a phancie towards it, any slight declaration of specialties will

serue to lead forward mens inclinable and prepared minds. The methode of winning the peoples affection vnto a generall liking of the Cause (for so ye terme it) hath bene this. First in the hearing of the multitude, the faults especially of higher callings are ripped vp with maruellous exceeding seuerity and sharpnesse of reproofe; which being oftentimes done, begetteth a great good opinion of integritie, zeale & holinesse, to such cōstant reproouers of sinne, as by likelihood would neuer be so much offended at that which is euill, vnlesse themselues were singularly good. The next thing hereunto is to impute all faults and corruptions wherewith the world aboundeth, vnto the kind of Ecclesiasticall gouernement established. Wherin, as before by reprouing faults, they purchased vnto themselues with the multitude a name to be vertuous; so by finding out this kind of cause, they obtaine to be iudged wise aboue others: whereas in truth vnto the forme euen of Iewish gouernement, which the Lord himselfe (they all confesse) did establish, with like shew of reason they might impute those faults which the Prophets condemne in the gouernors of that common wealth; as to the English kind of regiment Ecclesiasticall (whereof also God himselfe though in other sort is author) the staines and blemishes found in our State; which springing from the root of humaine frailty and corruption, not only are, but haue bene alwaies more or lesse, yea and (for any thing we know to the contrary) will be till the worlds end complained of, what forme of gouernement soeuer take place. Hauing gotten thus much sway in the hearts of men, a third step is to propose their owne forme of Church gouernement, as the onely soueraigne remedy of all euils; and to adorne it with all the glorious titles that may be. And the nature, as of men that haue sicke bodies, so likewise of the people in the crazednes of their minds possest with dislike and discontentment at things present, is to imagine that any thing (the vertue wherof they here commended) would helpe them; but that most, which they least haue tried. The fourth degree of inducements, is by fashioning the very notions & conceipts of mens minds in such sort, that when they read the Scripture, they may thinke that euery thing soundeth towards the aduancement of that discipline, and to the vtter disgrace of the contrary. Pythagoras,Arist. Metaph. lib. 1. cap. 5. by bringing vp his Schollers in the speculatiue knowledge of numbers, made their conceipts therein so strong, that when they came to the contemplation of things naturall, they imagined that in euery particular thing they euen beheld as it were with their eyes, how the elements of number gaue essence and being to the workes of nature. A thing in reason impossible: which notwithstanding through their misfashioned preconceipt, appeared vnto them no lesse certaine, then if nature had written it in the very

foreheads of all the creatures of God. When they of the family of loue haue it once in their heads, that Christ doth not signifie any one person, but a qualitie whereof many are partakers; that to be raised is nothing else but to be regenerated or indued with the said quality; and that when separation of them which haue it from them which haue it not is here made, this is iudgement; how plainely do they imagine that the Scripture euery where speaketh in the fauour of that sect? And assuredly the very cause which maketh the simple and ignorant to thinke they euen see how the word of God runneth currantly on your side, is that their minds are forestalled and their conceits peruerted before hand, by being taught that an Elder doth signifie a lay man admitted onely to the office of rule or gouernement in the Church; a Doctor one which may only teach and neither preach nor administer the Sacraments; a Deacon one which hath charge of the almes boxe and of nothing else: that the Scepter, the rod, the throne & kingdome of Christ, are a forme of regiment, onely by Pastors, Elders, Doctors and Deacons: that by mysticall resemblance mount Sion and Jerusalem are the Churches which admit, Samaria and Babylon the Churches which oppugne the said forme of regimēt. And in like sort they are taught to apply al things spoken of repairing the wals and decayed parts of the city & temple of God, by Esdras, Nehemias, & the rest: as if purposely the holy Ghost had therein ment to foresignifie, what the authors of admonitions to the Parliament, of supplications to the Councell, of petitions to her Maiesty, and of such other like writs, should either do or suffer in behalfe of this their cause. From hence they proceed to an higher point, which is the perswading of men credulous & ouer capable of such pleasing errors, that it is the speciall illumination of the holy Ghost, whereby they discerne those things in the word, which others reading yet discerne them not. Dearly beloued saith S. Iohn, Giue not credit vnto euery Spirit.

                truth: the one extraordinarie, the other common; the one belonging but vnto some few, the other extending it selfe vnto all that are of God; the one that which we call by a speciall diuine excellency Reuelation, the other Reason. If the Spirit by such reuelation haue discouered vnto thē the secrets of that discipline out of Scripture, they must professe themselues to be all (euen men, women, and children) Prophets. Or if reason be the hand which the Spirit hath led them by, for as much as perswasions grounded vpon reason are either weaker or stronger according to the force of those reasons whereupon the same are grounded, they must euery of them from the greatest to the least be able for euery seuerall article to shewe some special reason as strong as their perswasion therin is earnest. Otherwise

how can it be but that some other sinewes there are from which that ouerplus of strength in perswasion doth arise? Most sure it is, that when mens affections do frame their opinions, they are in defence of error more earnest a great deale, then (for the most part) sound belieuers in the maintenance of truth apprehended according to the nature of that euidence which Scripture yeeldeth: which being in some things plaine, as in the principles of Christian doctrine; in some things, as in these matters of discipline, more darke and doubtfull, frameth correspondently that inward assent which Gods most gracious Spirit worketh by it as by his effectuall instrument. It is not therefore the feruent earnestnes of their perswasion, but the soundnes of those reasons whereupon the same is built, which must declare their opinions in these things to haue bene wrought by the holy Ghost,2. Thes. 2.11. and not by the fraud of that euill Spirit which is euen in his illusions strong. After that the phancie of the common sort hath once throughly apprehended the Spirit to be author of their perswasion concerning discipline, then is instilled into their hearts, that the same Spirit leading men into this opinion, doth thereby seale them to be Gods children; and that as the state of the times now standeth, the most speciall token to know them that are Gods owne from others, is an earnest affection that way. This hath bred high termes of separation betweene such and the rest of the world; whereby the one sort are named The 
               
                  •
               rethren, The godly, and so forth; the other, worldlings, timeseruers, pleasers of men not of God, with such like. From hence, they are easily drawne on to thinke it exceeding necessarie, for feare of quenching that good Spirit, to vse all meanes whereby the same may be both strengthned in themselues, and made manifest vnto others. This maketh them diligent hearers of such as are knowne that way to incline; this maketh them eager to take and to seeke all occasions of secret conference with such; this maketh them glad to vse such as Counsellors and directors in all their dealings which are of waight, as contracts, testaments, and the like; this maketh them, through an vnweariable desire of receiuing instruction from the maisters of that companie, to cast off the care of those verie affaires which do most concerne their estate, and to thinke that then they are like vnto Marie, commendable for making choyce of the better part. Finally, this is it which maketh them willing to charge, yea oftentimes euen to ouercharge themselues, for such mens sustenance and reliefe, least their zeale to the cause should any way be vnwitnessed. For what is it which poore beguiled soules will not do through so powerfull incitements? In which respect it is also noted, that most labour hath bene

bestowed to win and retaine towards this cause them whose iudgements are commonly weakest by reason of their sex.2. Tim. 3.6. And although not women loden with sinnes, as the Apostle S. Paul speaketh, but (as we verily esteeme of them for the most part) women propense and inclinable to holines, be otherwise edified in good things rather then caried away as captiues into any kind of sinne and euill, by such as enter into their houses with purpose to plant there a zeale and a loue towards this kind of discipline: yet some occasion is hereby ministred for men to thinke, that if the cause which is thus furthered, did gaine by the soundnes of proofe wherupon it doth build it selfe, it would not most busily endeuor to preuaile, where least hability of iudgement is: and therefore that this so eminent industry in making proselytes more of that sex then of the other, groweth for that they are deemed apter to serue as instruments and helps in the cause. Apter they are through the eagernes of their affection, that maketh them which way soeuer they take, diligent in drawing their husbands, children, seruants, friends and allies the same way; apter through that naturall inclination vnto pity, which breedeth in them a greater readines then in men, to be bountifull towards their Preachers who suffer want; apter through sundry opportunities which they especially haue, to procure encouragements for their brethren; finally, apter through a singular delight which they take in giuing very large and particular intelligence, how all neere about them stand affected as cōcerning the same cause. But be they women or be they men, if once they haue tasted of that cup, let any man of contrary opinion open his mouth to perswade them, they close vp their eares,1. Iohn. 4.6. his reasons they waigh not, all is answered with rehearsall of the words of Iohn, We are of God, he that knoweth God, heareth vs; as for the rest, ye are of the world, for this worlds pompe & vanity it is that ye speake, and the world whose ye are heareth you. Which cloake sitteth no lesse fit on the backe of their cause, then of the Anabaptists, when the dignitie, authority and honour of Gods Magistrate is vpheld against them. Shew these egerly affected men their inhabilitie to iudge of such matters; their answer is,1. Cor.

Augustine writeth, saying: Martyrs rightly so named are they, not which suffer for their disorder, and for the vngodly breach they haue made of Christian vnitie; but which for righteousnes sake are persecuted. For Agar also suffered persecution at the hands of Sara; wherein, she which did impose was holy, and she vnrighteous which did beare the bu

If that must needs be the true Church which doth endure persecution, and not that which persecuteth, let them aske of the Apostle what Church Sara did represent, when she held her maide in affliction. For euen our mother which is free, the heauenly Ierusalem, that is to say, the true Church of God, was▪ as he doth affirme, prefigured in that very woman by whom the bondmaide was so sharply handled. Although, if all things be throughly skanned, she did in truth more persecute Sara by prowd resistance, then Sara hir, by seueritie of punishment. These are the pathes wherein ye haue walked that are of the ordinary sort of men, these are the very steps ye haue troden, and the manifest degrees whereby ye are of your guides and directors trained vp in that schoole: a custome of inuring your cares with reproofe of faults especially in your gouernors; an vse to attribute those faults to the kind of spirituall regiment vnder which ye liue; boldnesse in warranting the force of their discipline for the cure of all such euils; a slight of framing your conceipts to imagine that Scripture euery where fauoureth that discipline; perswasion that the cause, why ye find it in Scripture is the illumination of the spirit, that the same spirit is a seale vnto you of your neernes vnto God, that ye are by all meanes to nourish and witnesse it in your selues, and to strengthen on euery side your minds against whatsoeuer might be of force to withdraw you from it.

For which purpose sentences out of the word of God ye alleage diuerse: but so, that when

the same are discust, thus it alwayes in a manner falleth cut, that what things by vertue thereof ye vrge vpon vs as altogether necessarie, are found to be thence collected onely by poore and maruelous slight coniectures. I need not giue instance in any one sentence so alleaged, for that I thinke the instance in any alleaged otherwise a thing not easie to be giuen. A verie strange thing sure it were, that such a discipline as ye speake of should be taught by Christ and his Apostles in the word of God, and no Church euer haue found it out, nor receiued it till this present time; contrariwise, the gouernmēt against which ye bēd your selues, be obserued euery where throughout all generations and ages of the Christian world, no Church euer perceiuing the word of God to bee against it. Wee require you to finde out but one Church vpon the face of the whole earth, that hath bene ordered by your discipline, or hath not bene ordered by ours, that is to say, by episcopall regiment, sithence the time that the blessed Apostles were here conuersant. Many things out of antiquitie ye bring, as if the purest times of the Church had obserued the selfesame orders which you require; and as though your desire were, that the Churches of olde should be paternes for vs to follow, and euen glasses wherin we might see the practise of that which by you is gathered out of scripture.T.C. lib. 1. p. 97 But the truth is ye meane nothing lesse. All this is done for fashions sake onely, for ye complaine of it as of an iniury, that mē should be willed to seeke for examples and paternes of gouernment in any of those times that haue bene before. Ye plainly hold, that frō the very Apostles times till this present age wherein your selues imagine ye haue found out a right patern of sound discipline, there neuer was any time safe to be followed. Which thing ye thus endeuour to proue. Out of Egesippus ye say that Eusebius writeth,Euseb. 3. lib. 32 how although as long as the Apostles liued, the Church did remaine a pure virgin; yet after the death of the Apostles, and after they were once gone whom God vouchsafed to make hearers of the diuine wisedome with their owne eares, the placing of wicked error began to come into the Church.Lib. Strom. somewhat after the beginning. Lib. 7. c. 11. Clement also in a certaine place, to confirme that there was corruption of doctrine immediately after the Apostles times, alleageth the prouerb, that There are few sonnes like their fathers. Socrates saith of the church of Rome & Alexandria, the most famous Churches in ye Apostles times, that about the yeare 430. the Romain & Alexandrian Bishops leauing the sacred function, were degenerate to a secular rule or dominiō. Hereupō ye cōclude, that it is not safe to fetch our gouernment from any other then the Apostles times. Wherein by the way it may be noted, that in proposing the Apostles times as a paterne for ye Church to follow, though the desire of you all be one,

the drift and purpose of you all is not one. The chiefest thing which lay reformers yawne for is, that the Cleargie may through conformitie in state and condition be Apostolicall, poore as the Apostles of Christ were poore. In which one circumstance if they imagine so great perfection, they must thinke that Church which hath such store of mendicant Friers, a Church in that respect most happy. Were it for the glory of God, and the good of his Church in deede, that the Cleargie should be left euen as bare as the Apostles when they had neither staffe nor scrip; that God, which should lay vpon them the condition of his Apostles, would I hope, endue them with the selfesame affection which was in that holy Apostle, whose words concerning his owne right vertuous contentment of heart, As well how to want,

               as how to abound, are a most fit episcopall emprese. The Church of Christ is a body mysticall. A body cannot stand, vnlesse the parts thereof be proportionable. Let it therefore be required on both parts, at the hands of the Cleargie, to be in meannesse of state like the Apostles; at the hands of the laitie, to be as they were who liued vnder the Apostles: and in this reformation there will bee though little wisedome, yet some indifferencie. But your reformation which are of the Cleargie (if yet it displease ye not that I should say ye are of the Cleargie) seemeth to aime at a broader marke. Ye thinke that he which will perfectly reforme, must bring the forme of Church discipline vnto the state which then it was at. A thing neither possible, nor certaine, nor absolutely conuenient. Concerning the first, what was vsed in the Apostles times, the scripture fully declareth not; so that making their times the rule and Canon of Church politie, ye make a rule which being not possible to be fully knowne, is as impossible to be kept. Againe, sith the later euen of the Apostles owne times, had that which in the former was not thought vpon; in this generall proposing of the Apostolicall times, there is no certaintie which should be followed, especially seeing that ye giue vs great cause to doubt how far ye allow those times.

Thirdly, whereas it is the error of the common multitude, to consider onely what hath bene of olde, and if the same were well, to see whether still it continue; if not, to condemne that presently which is, and neuer to search vpon what ground or consideration the change might growe: such rudenes cannot be in you so well borne with, whom learning and iudgement

hath enabled much more soundly to discerne how farre the times of the Church, and the orders thereof may alter without offence. True it is,

                  ere sumptum. Apolog. c. 39. feastes of charitie, which being instituted by the Apostles, were reteined in the Church long after, are not now thought any where needfull. What man is there of vnderstanding, vnto whom it is not manifest, how the way of prouiding for the Cleargie by tithes, the deuise of almes-houses for the poore, the sorting out of the people into their seuerall parishes, together with sundrie other things which the Apostles times could not haue, (being now established) are much more conuenient and fit for the Church of Christ, then if the same should be taken away for conformities sake with the auncientest and first times? The orders therefore which were obserued in the Apostles times, are not to be vrged as a rule vniuersally, either sufficient or necessary. If they bee, neuerthelesse on your part it still remaineth to bee better prooued, that the forme of discipline which ye intitle apostolicall, was in the Apostles times exercised. For of this very thing ye faile euen touching that which ye make most account of, as being matter of substance in discipline, I meane the power of your lay-elders, and the difference of your Doctors from the Pastors in all Churches. So that in summe, we may be bold to conclude, that besides these last times, which for insolencie, pride, and egregious contempt of all good order are the worst, there are none wherein ye can truly affirme, that the complete forme of your discipline, or the substance thereof was practised. The euidence therefore of antiquitie failing you, yee flie to the iudgements of such learned men, as seeme by their writings to be of opinion that all Christian Churches should receiue your discipline, and abandon ours. Wherein, as ye heape vp the names of a number of men not vnworthy to be had in honor; so there are a number whom when ye mention, although it serue ye to purpose with the ignorant and vulgar sort, who measure by tale & not by waight, yet surely they who know what qualitie and value the men are of, will thinke ye drawe very neare the dregs. But were they all of as great account as the best and chiefest amongst them, with vs notwithstanding neither are they, neither ought they to be of such reckening, that their opinion or coniecture should cause the lawes of the Church of

England to giue place. Much lesse when they neither do all agree in yt opiniō, and of thē which are at agreemēt, the most part through a courteous inducement, haue followed one man as their guide, finally, that one therein not vnlikely to haue swarued. If any chance to say it is probable that in ye Apostles times there were layelders, or not to mislike the continuance of them in the Church; or to affirme that Bishops at the first were a name, but not a power distinct from presbyters; or to speake any thing in praise of those Churches which are without episcopall regimēt, or to reproue the fault of such as abuse that calling; all these ye register for men, perswaded as you are, that euery christian Church stādeth bound by the law of God to put downe Bishops, and in their roomes to erect an eldership so authorized as you would haue it for the gouernmēt of each parish. Deceiued greatly they are therfore, who think that all they whose names are cited amongst the fauourers of this cause, are on any such verdict agreed. Yet touching some materiall points of your discipline, a kind of agreement we grant there is amongst many diuines of reformed Churches abroad. For first to do as the Church of Geneua did, the learned in some other churches must needs be the more willing, who hauing vsed in like maner not the slow & tedious help of proceeding by publike authoritie, but the peoples more quick endeuor for alteratiō, in such an exigent I see not well how they could haue staied to deliberat about any other regimēt thē that which already was deuised to their hands, yt which in like case had bene takē, that which was easiest to be established without delay, that which was likeliest to content the people by reason of some kind of sway which it giueth them. When therfore the example of one Church was thus at the first almost through a kind of cōstraint or necessitie followed by many, their concurrence in perswasion about some materiall points belonging to the same policie is not strange. For we are not to maruell greatly, if they which haue all done the same thing, do easily embrace the same opinion as cōcerning their owne doings. Besides, mark I beseech you that which Galen in matter of philosophie noteth, for the like falleth out euen in questions of higher knowledge.Galen.

But if two, or three, or foure, agree all in the same tale, they iudge it then to be out of controuersie, and so are many times ouertaken, for want of due consideration; eyther some common cause leading them all in

Though ten persons be brought to giue testimony in any cause, yet if the knowledge they haue of the thing whereunto they come as witnesses, appeare to haue growne from some one amongst them,

and to haue spred it selfe from hand to hand, they all are in force but as one testimony. Nor is it otherwise here where the daughter Churches do speake their mothers dialect; here where so many sing one song, by reason that hee is the guide of the quier concerning whose deserued authoritie amongst euen the grauest diuines, we haue already spoken at large. Will ye aske what should moue those many learned to be followers of one mans iudgement, no necessitie of argument forcing them thereunto?Petit. to the Q▪M.P. 14. your demaund is answered by your selues. Loath ye are to thinke that they whom ye iudge to haue attained as sound knowledge in all points of doctrine, as any since the Apostles time, should mistake in discipline. Such is naturally our affection, that whom in great things we mightily admire;Eccles. 10.1. in them we are not perswaded willingly that any thing should be amisse. The reason whereof is, for that as dead flies putrifie the oyntment of the Apothecarie, so a little folly him that is in estimation for wisedome. This in euery profession hath too much authorized the iudgement of a few. This with Germans hath caused Luther, and with many other Churches Caluin, to preuaile in all things. Yet are we not able to define, whether the wisedome of that God (who setteth before vs in holy Scripture so many admirable paternes of vertue, and no one of them without somewhat noted wherin they were culpable, to the end that to him alone it might alwayes be acknowledged, Thou onely art holy, thou onely art iust) might not permit those worthy vessels of his glory to be in some thinges blemished with the staine of humaine frailtie, euen for this cause, least wee should esteeme of any man aboue that which behoueth.
            
               Their calling for triall by disputation.5. Notwithstanding, as though ye were able to say a great deale more then hitherto your bookes haue reuealed to the world, earnest chalengers ye are of triall by some publique disputation. Wherein if the thing ye craue bee no more then onely leaue to dispute openly about those matters that are in question, the schooles in Ʋniuersities (for any thing I know) are open vnto you: they haue their yearely Acts and Commencements, besides other disputations both ordinary and vpon occasion, wherein the seuerall parts of our owne Ecclesiasticall discipline are oftentimes offered vnto that kind of examination; the learnedest of you haue bene of late yeares noted seldome or neuer absent from thence at the time of those greater assemblies; and the fauour of proposing there in conuenient sort whatsoeuer ye can obiect (which thing my selfe haue knowne them to graunt of Scholasticall courtesie vnto straungers) neither hath (as I thinke) nor euer will (I presume) be denied you. If your suite be to haue some great extraordinary confluence, in expectation whereof the lawes that already are should sleepe and haue no power ouer you, till in the hearing of thousands ye all did acknowledge your error

and renounce the further prosecutiō of your cause; happily they whose authority is required vnto the satisfying of your demaund, do think it both dangerous to admit such cōcourse of deuided minds, & vnmeet yt laws which being once solemnly established are to exact obedience of all men, and to constraine therunto, should so far stoup, as to hold thēselues in suspēse frō taking any effect vpō you, till some disputer can perswade you to be obedient. A law is the deed of the whole body politike, wherof if ye iudge your selues to be any part, thē is the law euē your deed also. And were it reasō in things of this qualitie, to giue mē audience pleading for the ouerthrow of that which their own very deed hath ratified? Laws that haue bin approued, may be (no man doubteth) again repealed, & to yt end also disputed against, by the authors thereof thē
               selues. But this is whē the whole doth deliberate what laws each part shal obserue, & not when a part refuseth the laws which the whole hath orderly agreed vpon. Notwithstāding, for as much as ye cause we maintain is (God be thanked) such as needeth not to shun any triall, might it please thē on whose approbatiō the matter dependeth to cōdescend so far vnto you in this behalf, I wish hartily that proofe were made euen by solemne conferēce in orderly & quiet sort, whether you would your selues be satisfied, or else could by satisfying others draw thē to your part. Prouided alwaies, first in asmuch as ye go about to destroy a thing which is in force, & to draw in that which hath not as yet bin receiued; to impose on vs that which we think not our selues bound vnto, & to ouerthrow those things whereof we are possessed; yt therefore ye are not to claime in any such cōferēce other thē the plaintifs or opponents part, which must cōsist altogether in proofe & cōfirmation of two things: the one, yt our orders by you condēned we ought to abolish, the other yt yours, we are bound to accept in the stead therof. Secōdly, because the questions in cōtrouersie between vs are many, if once we descend vnto particularities, that for ye easier & more orderly proceeding therin, ye most generall be first discussed, nor any questiō left off, nor in each questiō ye prosecutiō of any one argumēt giuē ouer & another takē in hād, til ye issue wherunto by replies & answers both parts are come, be collected red & acknowledged aswel on ye one side as on the other to be ye plain cōclusiō which they are grown vnto. Thirdly for auoyding of the manifold incōueniēces wherunto ordinary & extēporal disputes are subiect, as also because if ye should singly dispute one by one as euery mans owne wit did best serue, it might be cōceiued by ye rest yt happily some other would haue done more; the chiefest of you do all agree in this action, yt whom ye shal then choose your speaker, by him yt which is publikely brought into disputation be acknowledged by al your cōsēts not to be his allegatiō but yours, such as ye all are agreed vpō, & haue required him to deliuer in al your names: ye true copy

whereof being taken by a notarie, that a reasonable time be allowed for returne of answere vnto you in the like forme. Fourthly, whereas a number of conferences haue bene had in other causes with the lesse effectual successe, by reason of partiall & vntrue reports, published afterwards vnto the world, that to preuent this euill, there be at the first a solemne declaration made on both parts of their agreement to haue yt very booke & no other set abroad, wherin their present authorized notaries do write those things fully & only, which being written & there read, are by their owne opē testimony acknowledged to be their owne. Other circumstances hereunto belōging, whether for the choice of time, place, and language, or for preuention of impertinent and needlesse speech, or to any end and purpose else, they may be thought on whē occasiō serueth. In this sort to broach my priuate conceipt for the ordering of a publike actiō, I should be loth, (albeit I do it not otherwise thē vnder correctiō of thē whose grauitie & wisedome ought in such cases to ouerrule) but yt so venterous boldnes I see is a thing now general, & am therby of good hope, yt where al mē are licensed to offēd, no man will shew himself a sharp accuser.
            
               No end of contention, without submission of both parts vnto some definitiue sentence.6. What successe God may giue vnto any such kind of conference or disputation, we cannot tell. But of this we are right sure, yt nature, scripture, and experience it selfe, haue all taught the world to seeke for ye ending of contentions by submitting it self vnto some iudiciall & definitiue sentence, wherevnto neither part that cōtendeth may vnder any pretence or colour refuse to stand. This must needs be effectuall and strong. As for other meanes without this, they seldome preuaile. J would therefore know whether for ye ending of these irksome strifes, wherein you and your followers do stand thus formally deuided against ye authorized guides of this Church, & the rest of the people subiect vnto their charge, whether I say ye be content to referre your cause to any other higher iudgement then your owne; or else intend to persist & proceed as ye haue begun, til your selues can be perswaded to cōdemn your selues. If your determinatiō be this, we can be but sorie that ye should deserue to be reckened with such,Rom.

Waies of peaceable conclusion there are but these two certaine: the one, a sentence of iudiciall decision giuen by authoritie therto appointed within our selues; the other, the like kind of sentence giuen by a more vniuersall authoritie. The former of which two waies God himselfe in the lawe prescribeth: and his Spirit it was which directed the very first Christian Churches in the world to vse the later. The ordinance of God in the lawe was this.Deut. 17.8. 
               If there arise a matter too hard for thee in iudgement betweene bloud & bloud, betweene plea &c. then shalt thou arise,

and goe vp vnto the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, and thou shalt come vnto the Priests of the Leuites▪ and vnto the Iudge that shall be in those dayes, and aske, and they shal shew thee the sentence of iudgement, & thou shalt do according to that thing which they of that place which the Lord hath chosen shewe thee; and thou shalt obserue to do according to al that they enform thee, according to the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the iudgemēt which they shal tell thee shalt thou do, thou shalt not decline from the thing which they shal shew thee to the right hand nor to the left. And that man that will do presumptuously, not harkning vnto the Priest (that standeth before the Lord thy God to minister there) or vnto the Iudge, that man shal dye,Act 15. and thou shalt take away euill from Israel. When there grew in the Church of Christ a question, Whether the Gentiles belieuing might be saued, although they were not circumcised after the manner of Moses, nor did obserue the rest of those legall rites & ceremonies wherunto the Iewes were bound; After great dissension and disputation about it, their conclusion in the end was, to haue it determined by sentence at Ierusalem; which was accordingly done in a Councell there assembled for the same purpose. Are ye able to alleage any iust and sufficient cause wherfore absolutely ye should not condescend in this controuersie to haue your iudgements ouerruled by some such definitiue sentence, whether it fall out to be giuen with or against you, that so these tedious contentions may cease? Ye will perhaps make answere, that being perswaded already as touching the truth of your cause, ye are not to harken vnto any sentence, no not though Angels should define otherwise, as the blessed Apostles owne example teacheth: againe that men, yea Councels may erre; and that vnlesse the iudgement giuen do satisfie your minds, vnlesse it be such as ye can by no further argumēt oppugne, in a word, vnlesse you perceiue and acknowledge it your selues consonant with Gods word, to stand vnto it not allowing it, were to sinne against your own cōsciences. But cōsider I beseech you first as touching ye Apostle, how that wherein he was so resolute & peremptory, our Lord Iesus Christ made manifest vnto him euen by intuitive reuelation, wherein there was no possibilitie of error: That which you are perswaded of▪ ye haue it no otherwise then by your owne only probable collectiō
               ▪ & therefore such bold asseuerations as in him were admirable, should in your mouthes but argue rashnes. God was not ignorant yt the Priests and Iudges, whose sentence in matters of controuersie 
                  〈◊〉
                ordained should stand, both might and oftentimes would be deceiued in their iudgement. Howbeit, better it was

in the eye of his vnderstanding, that sometime an erroneous sentence definitiue should preuaile, till the same authoritie perceiuing such ouersight, might afterwardes correct or reuerse it, then that strifes should haue respit to growe, and not come speedily vnto some end. Neither wish we that men should do any thing which in their hearts they are perswaded they ought not to doe, but this perswasion ought (we say) to be fully setled in their harts, that in litigious and controuersed causes of such qualitie, the will of God is to haue them to do whatsoeuer the sentence of iudiciall and finall decision shall determine, yea though it seeme in their priuate opiniō to swarue vtterly from that which is right: as no doubt many times the sentence amongst the Iewes did seeme vnto one part or other contending; and yet in this case God did then allow them to doe that which in their priuate iudgement it seemed (yea and perhaps truly seemed) that the lawe did disallow▪ For if God be not the author of confusion, but of peace; then can he not be the author of our refusall, but of our contentment, to stand vnto some definitiue sentence; without which almost impossible it is, that eyther wee should auoyd confusion, or euer hope to attaine peace. To small purpose had the Councell of Ierusalem bene assembled, if once their determination being set downe, men might afterwards haue defended their former opinions. When therefore they had giuen their definitiue sentence, all controuersie was at an ende. Things were disputed before they came to be determined; men afterwardes were not to dispute any longer, but to obey. The sentence of iudgement finished their strife, which their disputes before iudgement could not doe. This was ground sufficient for any reasonable mans conscience to build the dutie of obedience vpon, whatsoeuer his owne opinion were as touching the matter before in question. So full of wilfulnes and selfeliking is our nature, that without some definitiue sentence, which being giuen may stand, and a necessitie of silence on both sides afterward imposed; small hope there is that strifes thus far prosecuted, will in short time quietly end. Now it were in vaine to aske you whether ye could be content that the sentence of any Court already erected, should bee so farre authorized, as that among the Iewes established by God himselfe, for the determining of all controuersies: That man which wil do presumptuously, not harkning vnto the Priest that standeth before the Lord to minister there, nor vnto the Iudge, let him dye. Ye haue giuen vs already to vnderstand, what your opiniō is in part concerning her sacred Maiesties Court of high Commission, the nature whereof is the same with that amongst the Iewes, albeit the power be not so great. The other way happily may like you better, because Maister Beza in his last booke saue one written

Happier are they, whom the Lord when he commeth, shall finde doing in these things, then disputing about Doctors, Elders, & Deacons. Or if there be no remedie but somewhat needs ye must do which may tend to the setting forward of your discipline; do that which wise men, who thinke some Statute of the realme more fit to be repealed then to stand in force, are accustomed to do before they come to Parliament where the place of enacting is; that is to say, spend the time in reexamining more duly your cause, and in more throughly considering of that which ye labour to ouerthrow. As for the orders which are established, sith equitie and reason, the law of nature, God and man, do all fauour that which is in being, till orderly iudgement of decision be giuen against it; it is but iustice to exact of you, and peruersnes in you it should be to denie thereunto your willing obedience. Not that I iudge it a thing allowable for men to obserue those lawes which in their hearts they are stedfastly perswaded to be against the law of God: but your perswasion in this case ye are all bound for the time to suspend, and in otherwise doing, ye offend against God, by troubling his church without any iust or necessary cause▪ Be it yt there are some reasons inducing you to think hardly of our lawes.

And therefore vnto a necessary proofe yt they are not good, it must be giue place, But if the skilfullest amongst you can shew, yt all the bookes ye haue hitherto written be able to afford any one argument of this nature, let the instance be giuen.

                  uers are in publique charge and authoritie. As though when publique consent of the whole hath established anything, euery mans iudgement being thereunto compared were not priuate, howsoeuer his calling be to some kind of publique charge. So that of peace and quietnes there is not any way possible, vnlesse the probable voice of euery intier societie or body politique, ouerrule all priuate of like nature in the same body: Which thing effectually proueth, that God being author of peace and not of confusion in the Church, must needs be author of those mens peaceable resolutions, who concerning these thinges, haue determined with themselues to thinke and do as the Church they are of decreeth, till they see necessary cause enforcing them to the contrary.
            
               The matter contained in these eight bookes.7. Nor is mine owne intent any other in these seuerall bookes of discourse, then to make it appeare vnto you; that for the ecclesiasticall lawes of this land, we are led by great reason to obserue them, and ye by no necessitie bound to impugne them. It is no part of my secret meaning to draw you hereby into hatred, or to set vpō the face of this cause any fairer glasse then the naked truth doth afford: but my whole endeuour is to resolue the conscience, and to shew as neare as I can what in this controuersie the hart is to thinke, if it will follow the light of sound and sincere iudgement, without either clowd of preiudice or mist of passionate affection. Wherefore seeing that lawes and ordinances in particular, whether such as we obserue, or such as your selues would haue established, when the minde doth sift and examine them, it must needes haue often recourse to a number of doubts and questions about the nature, kindes, and qualities of lawes in generall, whereof vnlesse it be throughly enformed, there will appeare no certaintie to stay our perswasion vpon: I haue for that cause set downe in the first place an introduction on both sides needfull to bee considered: Declaring therein what law is, how different kindes of lawes there are, and what force they are of according vnto each kind. This done, because ye suppose the lawes for which ye striue are found in scripture; but those not, against which we striue; & vpon this surmise are drawne to hold it as the very maine pillar of your whole cause, that scripture ought to be the onely rule of all our actions, and consequently that the Church-orders which wee obserue being not commaunded in scripture, are offensiue and displeasant vnto God: I haue spent the second booke in sifting of this point, which standeth with you for the first and chiefest principle whereon ye build. Wherevnto the next in degree is, that as God will haue alwayes a Church vpon

earth while the worlde doth continue, and that Church stand in neede of gouernment, of which gouernment it behoueth himselfe to bee both the author and teacher: so it cannot stand with dutie that man should euer presume in any wise to chaunge and alter the same; and therefore▪ 
               That in Scripture there must of necessitie be found some particular forme of politie Ecclesiasticall, the lawes whereof admit not any kinde of alteration. The first three bookes being thus ended, the fourth proceedeth from the generall grounds and foundations of your cause, vnto your generall accusations against vs, as hauing in the orders of our Church (for so you pretend) corrupted the right forme of Church politie with manifolde popish rites and ceremonies, which certaine reformed Churches haue banished from amongst them, and haue thereby giuen vs such examples as (you thinke) wee ought to follow. This your assertion hath herein drawne vs to make search, whether these bee iust exceptions against the customes of our Church, when ye pleade that they are the same which the Church of Rome hath, or that they are not the same which some other reformed Churches haue deuised. Of those foure bookes which remaine and are bestowed about the specialties of that cause which lyeth in controuersie, the first examineth the causes by you alleaged, wherefore the publique duties of Christian religion, as our prayers, our Sacramants and the rest, should not be ordered in such sort as with vs they are▪ nor that power whereby the persons of men are consecrated vnto the ministerie, be disposed of in such maner as the lawes of this Church doe allow. The second and third are concerning the power of iurisdiction: the one, whether la
                  •
                men, such as your gouerning Elders are, ought in all congregations for euer to bee inuested with that power; the other, whether Bishops may haue that power ouer other Pastors, and there withall that honour which with vs they haue, And because besides the power of order which all consecrated persons haue, and the power of iurisdiction which neither they all nor they only haue▪ there is a third power, a power of Ecclesiasticall Dominion, communicable as wee thinke vnto persons not Ecclesiasticall, and most fit to be restrained vnto the Prince or Soueraigne commaunder ouer the whole body politique▪ the eight booke we haue allotted vnto this question, and haue sifted therein your obiections against those preeminences royall which thereunto appert

               How iust cause there is to feare the manifold dangerous euents likely to ensue vpon this intended reformation, if it did take place.8. The case so standing therefore my brethren as it doth, the wisdome of gouernors ye must not blame, in that they further also forecasting the manifold strange & dangerous innouations, which are more then likely to follow if your discipline should take place, haue for that cause thought it hitherto a part of their dutie to withstand your endeuors that way. The rather, for that they haue seene alreadie some small beginninges of the fruits thereof, in them who concurring with you in iudgement aboute the necessitie of that discipline, haue aduentured without more adoe, to separate themselues from the rest of the Church, and to put your speculations in execution. These mens hastines the warier sort of you doth not commend, yee wish they had held themselues longer in, and not so dangerously flowne abroad before the fethers of the cause had beene growne; their errour with mercifull terms ye reproue, naming them in great commiseration of mind, your poore brethren. They o
                  •
                the contrary side more bitterly accuse you as their false brethrē, & against you they plead saying:
From your breasts it is that we haue sucked those thinges, which when ye deliuered vnto vs, ye termed that heauenly, sincere,1. Pet. 2.2. and wholesome milke of Gods word, howsoeuer yee now abhorre as poyson that which the vertue thereof hath wrought and brought forth in vs. Ye sometime our companions,Psal. 55.13. guides and familiars, with whome we haue had most sweete consultations, are now become our professed aduersaries. because wee thinke the statute-congregations in Englande to bee no true Christian Churches; because wee haue seuered our selues from them; and because without their leaue or licence that are in Ciuill authoritie, wee haue secretly framed our owne Churches according to the platforme of the worde of God. For of that point betweene you and vs there is no controuersie. Alas what would ye haue vs to doe? At such time as ye were content to accept vs in the number of your owne, your teachinges we heard, we read your writinges: and though wee would, yet able wee are not to forget with what zeale yee haue euer profest, that in the English congregations (for so many of them as bee ordered according vnto their owne lawes,) the very publique seruice of God is fraught, as touching matter, with heapes of intollerable pollutions, and as concerning forme, borrowed from the shoppe of Antichrist; hatefull both waies in the eyes of the most holy: the kinde of their gouernment by Bishops and Archbishops, Antichristian, that discipline which Christ hath essentially tyed, that is to say, so vnited vnto his Church,Pref. against D. Baner. that wee cannot accompt it really to be his Church which hath not in it the same discipline, that verie discipline no lesse there despised, then in the highest throne of Antichrist, all such partes of the word of God as doe any way concerne that Discipline, no lesse vnsoundlie taught

and interpreted by all authorized English Pastors, then by Antichrists factors themselues; at Baptisme crossing, at the Supper of the Lord kneeling▪ at both a number of other the most notorious badges of Antichristian recognisance vsuall. Being moued with these and the like your effectuall discourses, whereunto we gaue most attentiue eare, till they entred euen into our soules, and were as fire within our bosomes; we thought we might hereof be bold to conclude, that sith no such Antichristian synagogue may be accompted a true Church of Christ, ye by accusing all congregations ordered according to the lawes of England as Antichristian, did meane to condemne those congregations, as not being any of them worthy the name of a true Christian Church. Ye tell vs now it is not your meaning. But what meant your often threatnings of them, who professing thēselues the inhabitants of mount Sion, were too loth to depart wholly as they should out of Babylon? Whereat our hearts being fearefully troubled, we durst not, we durst not continue longer so neere her confines, least her plagues might suddenly ouertake vs, before we did cease to be partakers with her sinnes: for so we could not choose but acknowledge with griefe that we were, when they doing euill, we by our presence in their assemblies seemed to like thereof, or at least wise not so earnestly to dislike, as became men heartily zealous of Gods glory. For aduenturing to erect the discipline of Christ without the leaue of the Christian Magistrate, happily ye may condemne vs as fooles, in that we hazard thereby our estates and persons, further then you which are that way more wise thinke necessary: but of any offence or sinne therein committed against God, with what conscience can you accuse vs, when your owne positions are, that the things we obserue should euery of them be dearer vnto vs then ten thousand liues; that they are the peremptory commaundements of God; that no mortall man can dispence with them, and that the Magistrate grieuously sinneth in not constraining thereunto? Will ye blame any man for doing that of his owne accord, which all men should be compelled to do that are not willing of themselues? When God commandeth, shall we answer that we will obey, if so be Caesar will graunt vs leaue? Is discipline an Ecclesiasticall matter or a Ciuill? If an Ecclesiasticall, it must of necessitie belong to the duty of the Minister. And the Minister (ye say) holdeth all his authority of doing whatsoeuer belongeth vnto the spirituall charge of the house of God, euen immediatly from God himselfe, without dependency vpon any Magistrate. Whereupon it followeth, as we suppose, that the hearts of the people being willing to be vnder the Scepter of Christ, the Minister of God, into whose hands the Lord himselfe hath put that Scepter, is without all excuse if thereby he guide them not. Nor do we finde that hitherto greatly ye haue

disliked those Churches abroad, where the people with direction of their godly ministers, haue euen against the will of the Magistrate brought in either the doctrine or discipline of Iesus Christ. For which cause we must now thinke the very same thing of you, which our Sauiour did sometime vtter concerning false harted Scribes and Pharises, They say and do not.
               
Thus the foolish Barrowist deriueth his schisme by way of conclusion,Matth. 23.3. as to him it seemeth, directly and plainely out of your principles. Him therefore we leaue to be satisfied by you from whom he hath sprung. And if such by your owne acknowledgement be persons dangerous, although as yet the alterations which they haue made are of small and tender groath; the changes likely to insue throughout all states and vocations within this land, in case your desire should take place, must be thought vpon. First concerning the supreme power of the highest, they are no small prerogatiues which now thereunto belonging the forme of your discipline will constraine it to resigne, as in the last booke of this treatise we haue shewed at large. Againe it may iustly be feared, whether our English Nobility, when the matter came in tryall, would contentedly suffer themselues to be alwayes at the call, and to stand to the sentence of a number of meane persons, assisted with the presence of their poore teacher, a man (as sometimes it hapneth) though better able to speake, yet little or no whit apter to iudge then the rest: from whom, be their dealings neuer so absurd (vnlesse it be by way of cōplaint to a Synod) no appeale may be made vnto any one of higher power, in as much as the order of your discipline admitteth no standing inequalitie of Courts, no spirituall iudge to haue any ordinary superiour on earth, but as many supremacies as there are parishes & seuerall Congregations. Neither is it altogether without cause that so many do feare the ouerthrow of all learning, as a threatned sequell of this your intended discipline. For if the worlds preseruation depend vpon the multitude of the wise; and of that sort the number hereafter be not likely to waxe ouer great,Sap. 6.24. 
               when (that where with the sonne of Syrach professeth himselfe at the heart grieued) men of vnderstanding are already so little set by:Eccl. 16.29. howe should their mindes whom the loue of so pretious a iewell filleth with secret iealousie euen in regard of the least things which may any way hinder the flourishing estate thereof, choose but misdoubt least this discipline, which alwayes you match with diuine doctrine as hir naturall and true sister, be found vnto all kinds of knowledge a stepmother; seeing that the greatest worldly hopes, which are proposed vnto the chiefest kind of learning, ye seeke vtterly to extirpate as weedes; and haue grounded your platforme on such propositions, as do after a sort vndermine those most renowmed habitations, where through the goodnesse of almightie

God all commendable arts and sciences are with exceeding great industrie hitherto (and so may they euer continue) studied, proceeded in, and profest. To charge you as purposely bent to the ouerthrow of that wherein so many of you haue attained no small perfection, were iniurious. Only therfore I wish that your selues did well consider how opposite certaine your positions are vnto the state of Collegiate societies, whereon the two Ʋniuersities consist. Those degrees which their statutes bind them to take, are by your lawes taken away; your selues who haue sought them ye so excuse, as that ye would haue men to thinke ye iudge them not allowable, but tollerable only, and to be borne with for some helpe which ye find in them vnto the furtherance of your purposes, till the corrupt estate of the Chur
                  •
               h may be better reformed. Your lawes forbidding Ecclesiasticall persons vtterly the exercise of Ciuill power, must needs depriue the Heads and Maisters in the same Colledges of all such authoritie as now they exercise, either at home, by punishing the faults of those, who not as children to their parents by the law of Nature, but altogether by ciuill authority are subiect vnto them; or abroad, by keeping Courts amongst their tenants. Your lawes making permanent inequalitie amongst Ministers a thing repugnant to the word of God, enforce those Colledges, the Seniors whereof are all or any part of them Ministers vnder the gouernment of a maister in the same vocation, to choose as oft as they meet together a new president. For if so ye iudge it necessary to do in Synods, for the auoyding of permanent inequality amongst Ministers, the same cause must needs euen in these Collegiate assemblies enforce the like. Except per aduenture ye meane to auoid all such absurdities, by dissoluing those Corporations, and by bringing the Vniuersities vnto the forme of the Schoole of Geneua. Which thing men the rather are inclined to looke for, in as much as the Ministery, whereinto their founders with singular prouidence haue by the same statutes appointed them necessarily to enter at a certaine time, your lawes bind them much more necessarily to forbeare, till some parish abroad call for them. Your opinion concerning the law Ciuill is,Humb. Motion to the L L. p. 50. that the knowledge thereof might be spared, as a thing which this land doth not need. Professors in that kind being few, ye are the bolder to spurne at them, and not to dissemble your minds as concerning their remoouall: in whose studies although my selfe haue not much bene conuersant, neuerthelesse exceeding great cause I see there is to wish that thereunto more encouragement were giuen, as well for the singular treasures of wisedome therein conteined, as also for the great vse we haue thereof both in decision of certaine kinds of causes arising daily within our selues, and especially for commerce with Nations abroad, whereunto that knowledge is most requisite.

The reasons wherewith ye would perswade that Scripture is the onely rule to frame all our actions by, are in euery respect as effectuall for proofe that the same is the onely law whereby to determine all our Ciuill controuersies. And then what doth let, but that as those men may haue their desire, who frankely broch it already that the worke of reformation will neuer be perfect, till the law of Iesus Christ be receiued alone; so pleaders and Counsellors may bring their bookes of the Common law, and bestow them as the students of curious & needlesse arts did theirs in the Apostles time?Act. 19.19. J leave them to scanne how farre those words of yours may reach,Mumb. M

                  t. p. 74. wherein ye declare, that whereas now many houses lye waste through inordinate suites of law, This one thing will showe the excellencie of Discipline for the wealth of the Realme, and quiet of Subiects, that the Church is to censure such a party who is apparantly troublesome and contentious, and without REASONABLE CAVSE vpon a meere will and stomacke doth vexe and molest his brother & troble the Country. For mine owne part I do not see but that it might verie well agree with your principles, if your discipline were fully planted, euen to send out your writs of surcease vnto all Courts of England besides, for the most things handled in them. A great deale further I might proceed and descend lower.Counterp. p. 108. But for as much as against all these and the like difficulties your answer is, that we ought to search what things are consonant to Gods will, not which be most for our owne ease; and therefore that your discipline being (for such is your errour) the absolute commaundement of Almightie God, it must be receiued although the world by receiuing it should be cleane turned vpside downe; herein lyeth the greatest danger of all. For whereas the name of diuine authority is vsed to countenance these things, which are not the commaundements of God, but your owne erronious collections; on him ye must father whatsoeuer ye shall afterwards be led, either to do in withstanding the aduersaries of your cause, or to thinke in maintenance of your doings. And what this may be, God doth know. In such kinds of error, the mind once imagining it selfe to seeke the execution of Gods will, laboureth foorthwith to remoue both things and persons which any way hinder it from taking place; and in such cases if any strange or new thing seeme requisite to be done, a strange and new opinion concerning the lawfulnesse therof, is withall receiued and broched vnder countenance of diuine authoritie. One example herein may serue for many, to shew that false opinions touching the will of God to haue things done, are wont to bring forth mightie and violent practises against the hinderances of them; and those practises new opinions more pernitious then the first, yea most extremely sometimes

opposite to yt which the first did seeme to intend. Where the people tooke vpon them the reformation of the Church by casting out popish superstition,Matth. 1

                  . they hauing receiued from their Pastors a generall instruction yt whatsoeuer the heauenly father hath not planted must be rooted out, proceeded in some forrein places so far, yt down went oratories & the very tēples of God thēselues. For as they chanced to take the compasse of their cōmission stricter or larger, so their dealings were accordingly more or lesse moderate. Amongst others there sprang vp presently one kind of mē, with whose zeale & forwardnesse the rest being compared, were thought to be maruelous cold & dull. These grounding thēselues on rules more generall; that whatsoeuer ye law of Christ commandeth not, thereof Antichrist is the author; and that whatsoeuer Antichrist or his adherents did in the world, the true professors of Christ are to vndoe; found out many things more then others had done, the extirpation whereof was in their conceipt as necessary as of any thing before remoued. Hereupon they secretly made their dolefull complaints euery where as they went, that albeit the world did begin to professe some dislike of that which was euill in the kingdome of darknesse, yet fruits worthy of a true repentance were not seene; & that if men did repent as they ought, they must endeuour to purge the earth of all maner euill, to the end there might follow a new world afterward, wherein righteousnesse only should dwell. Priuate repentance they sayd must appeare by euery mans fashioning his owne life contrary vnto the custome and orders of this present world, both in greater things and in lesse.Guy de Brés contre l'errent des Anabapa. tistes. p. 4. To this purpose they had alwayes in their mouthes those greater things, Charity, Faith, the true feare of God, the Crosse, the mortification of the flesh. All their exhortations were to set light of the things in this world, to count riche

They were sollicitors of men to fasts, to often meditations of heauenly things,p. 5. & as it were cōferences in secret with God by prayers, not framed according to the frosen maner of the world, but expressing such feruēt desires as might euen force God to hearken vnto them. Where they found men in diet, attire,p. 16. p. 1.8.119. furniture of house, or any other way obseruers of Ciuilitie, and decent order, such they reprooued as being carnally and earthly minded.120. Euery word otherwise then seuerely and sadly vttered, seemed to pierce like a sword thorow them. If any man were pleasant,p. 116. their manner was presently with deepe sighes to repeate those words of our Sauiour Christ,p. 124. Luc. 6.12. 
               Wo be to you which now laugh, for ye shall lament. So great was their delight to be alwaies in trouble, yt such as did quietly lead their liues, they iudged of all other men

to be in most dangerous case.p. 117. They so much affected to crosse the ordinary custome in euery thing, yt when other mens vse was to put on better attire, they would be sure to shew thēselues openly abroad in worse: the ordinary names of the daies in the weeke they thought it a kind of prophanes to vse, & therefore accustomed thēselues to make no other distinction then by numbers, The First, Second, Third day. From this they proceeded vnto publike reformatiō, first Ecclesiasticall,p. 40. and then Ciuill. Touching the former, they boldly aduouched, that themselues only had the truth, which thing vpon perill of their liues they would at all times defend; & that since the Apostles liued, the same was neuer before in al points sincerely taught. Wherfore that things might againe be brought to that auncient integritie which Iesus Christ by his word requireth, they began to controule the ministers of the Gospell for attributing so much force and vertue vnto the Scriptures of God read, whereas the truth was, that when the word is said to engender faith in the heart, and to conuert the soule of man, or to worke any such spirituall diuine effect, these speeches are not thereunto appliable as it is read or preached, but as it is ingrafted in vs by the power of the holy Ghost opening the eyes of our vnderstanding, and so reuealing the mysteries of God, according to that which Ieremy promised before should be,Ier. 31.34. saying, I will put my law in their inward parts, and I will write it in their hearts.
               p. 29. The booke of God they notwithstanding for the most part so admired,p. 27. that other disputation against their opinions then onely by allegation of Scripture they would not heare; besides it, they thought no other writings in the world should be studied; in so much as one of their great Prophets exhorting them to cast away all respects vnto humane writings, so far to his motion they condescended, that as many as had any bookes saue the holy Bible in their custody, they brought and set them publiquely on fire. When they and their Bibles were alone together, what strange phantasticall opinion soever at any time entred into their heads, their vse was to thinke the Spirit taught it them. Their phrensies concerning our Sauiours incarnation, the state of soules departed, & such like, are things needlesse to be rehearsed. And for as much as they were of the same suite with those of whom the Apostle speaketh,2. Tim. 3.7. saying, They are still learning, but neuer attaine to the knowledge of truth, it was no maruaile to see them euery day broach some new thing, not heard of before. Which restlesse leuitie they did interpret to be their growing to spirituall perfection, and a proceeding from faith to faith.p. 65.6

The differences amongst them grew by this meane in a maner infinite, so that scarcely was there found any one of them, the forge of whose braine was not possest with some speciall mysterie.p. 135. Whereupon, although their mutuall contentions were most fiercely prosecuted amongst

themselues; yet when they came to defend the cause common to them all against the aduersaries of their faction, they had wayes to licke one another whole, the sounder in his owne perswasion,P. 25. excusing THE DEARE BRETHREN, which were not so farre enlightned, and professing a charitable hope of the mercy of God towards them notwithstanding their swaruing from him in some things.P. 71. 124. Their owne ministers they highly magnified as men whose vocation was frō God: the rest their maner was to terme disdainfully Scribes and Pharises, to accompt their calling an humaine creature, and to deteine the people as much as might be from hearing them.p. 764. As touching Sacraments; baptisme administred in ye church of Rome, they iudged to be but an execrable mockery & no baptisme; both because the Ministers thereof in the papacy are wicked idolaters, lewd persons, theeues, and murderers, cursed creatures, ignorant beasts; & also for that to baptise is a proper action belonging vnto none but the Church of Christ, whereas Rome is Antichrists synagogue.p. 748. The custome of vsing Godfathers & Godmothers at Christnings they scorned. Baptising of infants, although confest by thēselues to haue bin continued euē sithens the very Apostles owne times,p. 112. yet they altogether condemned: partly because sundry errors are of no lesse antiquity;p. 518. and partly for yt there is no commandement in the Gospell of Christ which sayth,p. 722.

The Eucharist they receiued (pretending our Lord & Sauiours example) after supper: & for auoiding all those impieties which haue bin grounded vpon ye mysticall words of Christs, This is my body, This is my bloud; they thought it not safe to mention either body or bloud in yt Sacrament, but rather to abrogate both, & to vse no words but these, Take, eate, declare the death of our Lord: drinke,

Luther made request vnto Fredericke Duke of Saxony,p. 6. that within his dominion they might be fauourably dealt with and spared, for that (their errour exempted) they seemed otherwise right good men. By meanes of which mercifull tolleration they gathered strength, much more then was safe for the state of the common wealth wherein they liued.p. 4.20.

                  . The meanes whereby they both allured and retained so great multitudes were most effectuall; first a wonderfull shew of zeale towards God, where with they seemed to be euen rapt in euery thing they spake: secondly an hatred of sinne, and a singular loue of integrity, which men did thinke to be much more then ordinary in them, by reason of the custome which they had to fill ye eares of the people with inuectiues against their authorised guides, as well spirituall as ciuill: thirdly the bountifull reliefe where with they eased the broken estate of such needie creatures, as were in yt respect the more apt to be drawne away: fourthly, a tender compassion which they were thought to take vpon the miseries of the common sort, ouer whose heads their manner was euen to powre down showers of teares in complayning yt no respect was had vnto thē, that their goods were deuoured by wicked cormorants,p. 6 7. their persons had in contempt, all liberty both temporall & spirituall taken from them, that it was high time for God now to heare their grones, and to send them deliuerance: lastly a cunning slight which they had to stroke and smooth vp the mindes of their followers, as well by appropriating vnto them all the fauourble titles, the good wordes, and the gracious promises in Scripture; as also by casting the contrary alwaies on the heades of such as were seuered from that retinue. Whereupon the peoples cōmon acclamation vnto such deceiuers was,7. These

are verily the men of God, these are his true and sincere Prophets. If any such Prophet or man of God did suffer by order of law condigne and deserued punishment; were it for felony, rebellion, murder, or what else,p. 17. the people (so strangely were their hearts inchanted) as though blessed Saint Stephen had bene againe martyred, did lament that God tooke away his most deere seruants from them. In all these things being fully perswaded, that what they did, it was obedience to the will of God, and that all men should do the like; there remained after speculation practise,p. 6. whereby the whole world thereunto (if it were possible) might be framed. This they saw could not be done, but with mighty opposition and resistance: against which to strengthen themselues, they secretly entred into league of association. And peraduenture considering, that although they were many, yet long warres would in time waste them out; they began to thinke whether it might not be that God would haue them do for their speedie an mighty increase, the same which sometime Gods owne chosen people, the people of Israell did. Glad and faine they were to haue it so: which very desire was it selfe apt to breed both an opinion of possibilitie, and a willingnesse to gather arguments of likelihood that so God himselfe would haue it. Nothing more cleare vnto their seeming, then that a new Jerusalem being often spoken of in Scripture, they vndoubtedly were themselues that newe Ierusalem, and the old did by way of a certaine figuratiue resemblance signifie what they should both be and do. Here they drewe in a Sea of matter, by applying all things vnto their owne companie, which are any where spoken concerning diuine fauours and benefits bestowed vppon the old Common-wealth of Israell; concluding that as Israell was deliuered out of Aegypt, so they spiritually out of the Aegypt of this worldes seruile thraldome vnto sinne and superstition; as Israell was to roote out the Idolatrous nations, and to plant in steede of them a people which feared God, so the same Lords goodwill and pleasure was nowe, that these new Israelites should vnder the conduct of other Iosuaes, Sampsons, and Gedeons, performe a worke no lesse miraculous in casting out violently the wicked from the earth, and establishing the kingdome of Christ with perfect libertie: and therefore as the cause why the children of Israell tooke vnto one man many wiues, might be least the casualties of warre should any way hinder the promise of God concerning their multitude from taking effect in them; so it was not vnlike that for the necessarie propagation of Christes kingdome vnder the Gospell, the Lord was content to allowe as much. Now whatsoeuer they did in such sort collect out of Scripture, when they came to iustifie or perswade it vnto others, all was the heauenly fathers

appointment, his commandement, his will and charge. Which thing is the very point in regard whereof I haue gathered this declaration. For my purpose herein is to shew, that when the minds of men are once erroniously perswaded that it is the will of God to haue those things done which they phancie; their opinions are as thornes in their sides, neuer suffering them to take rest till they haue brought their speculations into practise: the lets and impediments of which practise their restlesse desire and study to remoue, leadeth them euery day forth by the hand into other more dangerous opinions, sometimes quite & cleane contrary to their first pretended meanings: so as what will grow out of such errors as go masked vnder the cloake of diuine authority, impossible it is that euer the wit of man should imagine, till time haue brought forth the fruits of them: for which cause it behoueth wisedome to feare the sequels thereof, euen beyond all apparant cause of feare. These men in whose mouthes at the first, sounded nothing but onely mortification of the flesh; were come at the length to thinke they might lawfully haue their sixe or seuen wiues apeece: they which at the first thought iudgement and iustice it selfe to be mercilesse cruelty; accompted at the length their owne hands sanctified with being imb

Exod. 11.2. 
               The meeke ones must inherite the earth, and that their title hereunto was the same which the righteous Israelites had vnto ye goods of the wicked Aegyptians. Wherefore sith the world hath had in these men so fresh experience, how dangerous such actiue errors are, it must not offend you though touching the sequell of your present misperswasions much more be doubted, then your owne intents and purposes do happily aime at. And yet your words already are somewhat, when ye affirme that your pastors, Doctors,Matt. in his

Elders, and Deacons, ought to be in this Church of England, whether hir Maiestie and our state will or no; when for the animating of your consederates ye publish the musters which ye haue made of your owne bands, and proclaime them to amount I know not to how many thousands; when ye threaten, that sith neither your suites to the Parliament, nor

supplications to our Conuocation house, neither your defences by writing; nor chalenges of disputation in behalfe of that cause are able to preuaile,Demonstr. in the praef. we must blame our selues if to bring in discipline some such meanes hereafter be vsed as shall cause all our harts to ake. That things doubtfull are to be constered in the better part, is a principle not safe to be followed in matters concerning the publique state of a common weale. But howsoever these and the like speeches be accompted as arrowes idly shot at randon, without either eye had to any marke, or regard to their lighting place: hath not your longing desire for the practise of your discipline, brought the matter already vnto this demurrer amongst you, whether the people and their godly pastors that way affected, ought not to make separation from the rest, and to begin the exercise of discipline without the licence of Ciuill powers, which licence they haue sought for, and are not heard? Vpon which question as ye haue now deuided your selues, the warier sort of you taking the one part, and the forwarder in zeale the other; so in case these earnest ones should preuaile, what other sequell can any wise man imagine but this, that hauing first resolued that attempts for discipline without superiors are lawfull, it will follow in the next place to be disputed what may be attempted against superiors which will not haue the scepter of that discipline to rule ouer them? Yea euen by you which haue stayed your selues from running headlong with the other sort, somewhat notwithstanding there hath bene done without the leaue or liking of your lawfull superiors, for the exercise of a part of your discipline amongst the Cleargy thereunto addicted. And least examination of principall parties therein should bring those things to light, which might hinder and let your proceedings; behold for a barre against that impediment, one opinion ye haue newly added vnto the rest euen vpon this occasion, an opinion to exempt you from taking oathes which may turne to the molestation of your brethren in that cause. The next neighbour opinion whereunto, when occasion requireth, may follow for dispensation with oathes already taken, if they afterwards be found to import a necessity of detecting ought which may bring such good men into trouble or damage, whatsoeuer the cause be. O mercifull God, what mans wit is there able to found the depth of those daungerous and fearefull euils, whereinto our weake and impotent nature is inclinable to sinke itselfe, rather then to shew an acknowledgement of error in that which once we haue vnaduisedly taken vpon vs to defend, against the streame as it were of a contrary publique resolution! Wherefore if we anie thing respect their error, who being perswaded euen as ye are, haue gone further vpon that perswasion then ye allow; if we regard the present state of the highest gouernour

placed ouer vs, if the quality and disposition of our Nobles, if the orders and lawes of our famous Ʋniuersities, it the profession of the Civil, or the practise of the Common law amongst vs, if the mischiefes whereinto euen before our eyes so many others haue fallen headlong from no lesse plausible and faire beginnings then yours are: there is in euery of these considerations most iust cause to feare, least our hastines to embrace a thing of so perilous consequence, should cause posterity to feele those euils, which as yet are more easie for vs to preuent, then they would be for them to remedy.
            
               The conclusion of all.9. The best and safest way for you therefore my deere brethren is, to call your deeds past to a new reckening, to reexamine the cause ye haue taken in hand, and to try it euen point by point, argument by argument, with all the diligent exactnesse ye can; to lay aside the gall of that bitternesse wherein your minds haue hitherto ouer abounded, and with meeknesse to search the truth. Thinke ye are men, deeme it not impossible for you to erre: sift vnpartially your owne hearts, whether it be force of reason, or vehemency of affection, which hath bred, and still doth feed these opinions in you. If truth do any where manifest it selfe, seeke not to smother it with glosing delusions, acknowledge the greatnesse thereof, and thinke it your best victory when the same doth preuaile ouer you.
            That ye haue bene earnest in speaking or writing againe and againe the contrary way, should be no blemish or discredit at all vnto you. Amongst so many so huge volumes as the infinite paines of Saint Augustine haue brought foorth, what one hath gotten him greater loue, commendation and honour, then the booke wherein he carefully collecteth his owne ouersights, and sincerely condemneth them? Many speeches there are of Iobes, whereby his wisedome and other vertues may appeare: but the glory of an ingenuous mind he hath purchased by these words onely,Iob. 39.37. 
               Behold, I will lay mine hand on my mouth; I haue spoken once, yet will I not therefore maintaine argument; yea twice, howbeit for that cause further I will not proceed. Farre more comfort it were for vs (so small is the ioy we take in these strifes) to labour vnder the same yoke, as men that looke for the same eternall reward of their labours, to be ioyned with you in bands of indissoluble loue and amity, to liue as if our persons being many our soules were but one, rather then in such dismembred sort to spend our few and wretched daies in a tedious prosecuting of wearisome contentions▪ the end whereof, if they haue not some speedy ende, will be heauie euen on both sides. Brought alreadie we are euen to that estate which Gregorie Nazianzene mournefully describeth, saying.

The onely godlines we glory in, is to finde out somewhat whereby we may iudge others to be vngodly. Each others faults we obserue, as matter of exprobration, and not of griefe.

The lesse wee are to maruell if they iudge vilely of vs, who although we did well, would hardly allow therof. On our backs they also build that are lewd, and what we obiect one against an other, the same they vse to the vtter scorne and disgrace of vs all. This we haue gained by our mutuall homedissentions. This we are worthily rewarded with, which are more forward to striue, then becommeth men of vertuous and mild disposition.

Our comfortable expectation and most thirstie desire whereof what man soeuer amongst you shall any way helpe to satisfie, (as we truly hope there is no one amongst you but some way or other will) the blessings of the God of peace both in this world and in the world to come, be vppon him moe then the starres of the firmament in number.

            The seauenth, of the power of iurisdiction and the honor which is annexed thereunto in Bishops.

                  9 Of the benefit of keeping that lawe which reason teacheth.
                  10 How reason doth lead men vnto the making of humane lawes whereby politique societies are gouerned, and to agreement about lawes whereby the fellowship or communion of independent societies standeth.
                  11 Wherefore God hath by scripture further made knowne such supernaturall lawes as do serue for mens direction.
                  12 The cause why so many naturall or rationall lawes are set downe in holy scripture.
                  13 The benefit of hauing diuine lawes written.
                  14 The sufficiencie of scripture vnto the end for which it was instituted.
                  15 Of lawes positiue conteined in scripture, the mutabilitie of certaine of them, and the generall vse of scripture.

               se such as openly reproue supposed disorders of state are taken for principall friendes to the common benefite of all, and for men that carry singular freedome of mind; vnder this faire and plausible colour whatsoeuer they vtter passeth for

good and currant. That which wanteth in the waight of their speech, is supplyed by the aptnes of mens minds to accept and beleeue it. Whereas on the other side, if we maintaine thinges that are established, wee haue not onely to striue with a number of heauie preiudices deepely rooted in the hearts of men, who thinke that herein we serue the time, and speake in fauour of the present state, because thereby we eyther hold or seeke preferment; but also to beare such exceptions as minds so auerted before hand vsually take against that which they are loath should be powred into them. Albeit therefore much of that we are to speake in this present cause, may seeme to a number perhaps tedious, perhaps obscure, darke, and intricate, (for many talke of the truth, which neuer sounded the depth from whence it springeth, and therfore when they are led thereunto they are soone weary, as men drawne from those beaten pathes wherewith they haue bene inured): yet this may not so farre preuaile, as to cut off that which the matter it selfe requireth, howsoeuer the nice humour of some be therewith pleased or no. They vnto whom we shall seeme tedious, are in no wise iniuried by vs, because it is in their owne hands to spare that labour which they are not willing to endure. And if any complaine of obscuritie, they must consider, that in these matters it commeth no otherwise to passe, then in sundry the workes both of art and also of nature, where that which hath greatest force in the very things we see, is notwithstanding it selfe oftentimes not seene. The statelinesse of houses, the goodlines of trees, when we behold them delighteth the eye; but that foundation which beareth vp the one, that roote which ministreth vnto the other nourishment and life, is in the bosome of the earth concealed; & if there be at any time occasion to search into it, such labour is then more necessary then pleasant, both to them which vndertake it, and for the lookers on. In like manner the vse and benefite of good lawes, all that liue vnder them may enioy with delight and comfort, albeit the groundes and first originall causes from whence they haue sprung be vnknowne, as to the greatest part of men they are. But when they who withdraw their obedience, pretend that the lawes which they should obey are corrupt and vitious; for better examination of their qualitie, it behoueth the very foundation and roote, the highest welspring and fountaine of them to be discouered. Which because wee are not oftentimes accustomed to doe, when wee doe it, the paines wee take are more needefull a great deale then acceptable, and the matters which wee handle seeme by reason of newnesse, (till the minde grow better acquainted with them) darke, intricate and vnfamiliar. For as much helpe whereof as may be in this case, I haue endeuoured throughout the body of this whole discourse, that euery former part might giue strength vnto all that followe, and euery later bring some light vnto all before. So that if the iudgements of men doe but holde themselues in suspence as touching these first more generall meditations, till in order they haue perused the rest that ensue: what may seeme darke at the first will afterwardes be founde more plaine, euen as the later particular decisions will appeare I doubt not more strong, when the other haue beene read before. The lawes of the Church, whereby for so many ages together wee haue bene guided in the exercise of Christian religion and the seruice of the true God, our rites, customes, and orders of Ecclesiasticall gouernment, are called in

question; wee are accused as men that will not haue Christ Iesus to rule ouer them, but haue wilfully cast his statutes behinde their backes, hating to bee reformed, and made subiect vnto the scepter of his discipline. Behold therefore wee offer the lawes whereby wee liue vnto the generall triall and iudgement of the whole world; hartily beseeching almightie God, whome wee desire to serue according to his owne will, that both wee and others (all kinde of partiall affection being cleane laide aside) may haue eyes to see, and hearts to embrace, the things that in his sight are most acceptable. And because the point about which wee striue is the qualitie of our lawes, our first entrance hereinto cannot better be made, then with consideration of the nature of lawe in generall, and of that lawe which giueth life vnto all the rest which are commendable iust and good, n
                  •
               mely the lawe whereby the Eternall himselfe doth worke. Proceeding from hence to the lawe, first of nature, then of scripture, we shall haue the easier accesse vnto those things which come after to be debated, concerning the particular cause and question which wee haue in hand.
            2 All thinges that are, haue some operation not violent or casuall.Of that lawe which God from before the beginning hath set for himselfe to do all things by. Neither doth any thing euer begin to exercise the same, without some foreconceiued ende for which it worketh. And the ende which it worketh for is not obteined, vnlesse the worke bee also fit to obteine it by. For vnto euery ende euery operation will not serue. That which doth assigne vnto each thing the kinde, that which doth moderate the force and power, that which doth appoint the forme and measure of working, the same we tearme a Lawe. So that no certaine ende could euer bee attained, vnlesse the actions whereby it is attained were regular, that is to say, made suteable, fit and correspondent vnto their ende, by some Canon rule or lawe. Which thing doth first take plac
                  •
                in the workes euen of God himselfe. All thinges therefore doe worke after a sort according to lawe: all other thinges according to a lawe, whereof some superiours vnto whome they are subiect is author; onely the workes and operations of God, haue him both for their worker, and for the lawe whereby they are wrought. The being of God, is a kinde of lawe to his working: for that perfection which God is, giueth perfection to that hee doth. Those naturall, necessary, and internall operations of God, the generation of the Sonne, the proceeding of the Spirit, are without the compasse of my present intent: which is to touch onely such operations as haue their beginning and being by a voluntary purpose, wherewith God hath eternally decreed when and how they should bee. Which eternall decree is that wee tearme an eternall lawe. Dangerous it were for the feeble braine of man to wade farre into the doings of the most High; whome although to knowe bee life, and ioy to make mention of his name; yet our soundest knowledge is, to know that wee know him not as indeede hee is, neither can know him; and our safest eloquence concerning him is our silence when we confesse without confession, that his glory is inexplicable, his greatnesse aboue our capacitie and reach. Hee is aboue, and wee vpon earth; therefore it behoueth our wordes to bee warie and fewe, Our God is one, or rather very onenesse, and meere vnitie, hauing nothing but it selfe in it selfe, and not consisting (as all things doe besides God) of many things. In which essentiall vnitie of God, a Trinitie personall neuerthelesse subsisteth,

after a maner far exceeding the possibilitie of mans conceipt. The works which outwardly are of God, they are in such sort of him being one, that each person hath in them somewhat peculiar and proper. For being three, and they all subsisting in the essence of one deitie; from the Father, by the Sonne, through the Spirit,Ioh. 1

That which the Sonne doth heare of the Father, and which the Spirit doth receiue of the Father & the Sonne, the same we haue at the hāds of the Spirit, as being the last, and therfore the nearest vnto vs in order, although in power the same with the second and the first. The wise and learned among the very Heathens themselues, haue all acknowledged some first cause, whereupon originally the being of all things dependeth. Neither haue they otherwise spoken of that cause, then as an Agent, which knowing what and why it worketh, obserueth in working a most exact order or lawe.

They all confesse therfore in the working of that first cause, that counsell is vsed, reason followed, a way obserued, that is to say, constant order and law is kept, wherof it selfe must needs be author vnto it selfe. Otherwise it should haue some worthier and higher to direct it, and so could not it selfe be the first. Being the first, it can haue no other then it selfe to be the author of that law which it willingly worketh by▪ God therefore is a law both to himselfe, and to all other things besides. To himselfe he is a law in all those things whereof our Sauiour speaketh, saying, My Father worketh as yet,

               so I. God worketh nothing without cause. All those things which are done by him, haue some ende for which they are done: and the ende for which they are done, is a reason of his will to do them. His will had not inclined to create woman, but that he saw it could not be wel if she were not created,Gen. 2.18. 
               Non est bonum, It is not good man should be alone, Therfore let vs make an helper for him. That and nothing else is done by God, which to leaue vndone were not so good. If therfore it bee demanded, why God hauing power & hability infinit, th'effects notwithstāding of that power are all so limited as wee see they are: the reason hereof is, the end which he hath proposed, and the lawe whereby his wisedome hath, stinted th'effects of his power in such sort, that it doth not worke infinitely, but correspōdently vnto that end for which it worketh, euen al things

The generall ende of Gods external working, is the exercise of his most glorious and most abundant vertue: Which abundance doth shew it selfe in varietie, and for that cause this varietie is oftentimes in scripture exprest by the name of riches. The Lord hath made all things for his owne sake.

The particular drift of euery acte proceeding externally from God,prou. 16.6. we are not able to discerne, and therefore cannot alwaies giue the proper and certaine reason of his works. Howbeit vndoubtedly a proper and certaine reason there is of euery finite worke of God, in as much as there is a law imposed vpon it; which if there were not, it should be infinite euen as the worker himselfe is. They erre therfore who think that of the will of God to doe this or that, there is no reason

besides his will. Many times no reason knowne to vs; but that there is no reason thereof, I iudge it most vnreasonable to imagine, in as much as hee worketh all things 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , not onely according to his owne will,Ephe. 1.13. but the counsell of his owne will. And whatsoeuer is done with counsell or wise resolution, hath of necessitie some reason why it should be done, albeit that reason bee to vs in somethings so secret, that it forceth the wit of man to stand, as the blessed Apostle himself doth, amazed therat,Rom. 11.33. 
               O the depth of the riches both of the wisdome and knowledge of God, How vnsearchable are his iudgements, &c!

                as transgresseth not his owne law, then which nothing can be more absolute, perfect & iust. The law wherby he worketh, is eternall, and therfore can haue no shew or colour of mutability: for which cause a part of that law being opened in the promises which God hath made, (because his promises are nothing else but declarations what God will do for the good of men) touching those promises the Apostle hath witnessed, that God may as possibly denie himselfe and not be God;2. Tim. 2.13. as faile to performe them. And cōcerning the counsel of God, he termeth it likewise a thing vnchangeable; the counsel of God,Heb. 6.17. and that law of God wherof now we speake, being one. Nor is the freedome of the wil of God any whit abated, let or hindered by meanes of this; because the impositiō of this law vpō himselfe is his own free & volūtary act. This law therfore we may name eternal, being that order which God before al ages hath set down with himself, for himself to do all things by.

                  em to obserue, and their necessary maner of keeping it. not which God hath eternally purposed himselfe in all his workes to obserue, but rather that which with himselfe he hath set downe as expedient to be kept by all his creatures, according to the seuerall conditiō wherwith he hath indued them. They who thus are accustomed to speake, apply the name of Lawe vnto that onely rule of working which superiour authority in poseth; whereas we somewhat more enlarging the sense thereof, terme any kind of rule or Canon whereby actions are framed, a lawe. Now that lawe which as it is laid vp in the bosome of God, they call eternall, receiueth according vnto the different kinds of things which are subiect vnto it, different and sundry kinds of names. That part of it which ordereth naturall agēts, we call vsually natures law: that which Angels doe clearely behold, and without any swaruing obserue, is a

law coelestiall and heauenly: the law of reason, that which bindeth creatures reasonable in this world, and with which by reason they may most plainely perceiue themselues bound; that which bindeth them, and is not knowne but by speciall reuelation from God, Diuine law; humane law, that which out of the law either of reason or of God, men probably gathering to be expedient, they make it a lawe. All things therfore, which are as they ought to be, are conformed vnto this second law eternall, and euen those things which to this eternal law are not conformable, are notwithstanding in some sort ordered by the first eternall lawe. For what good or euill is there vnder the sunne, what action correspondent or repugnant vnto the law which God hath imposed vpō his creatures, but in or vpon it God doth worke according to the law which himselfe hath eternally purposed to keep, that is to say, the first law eternall? So that a twofold law eternall being thus made, it is not hard to conceiue how they both take place in Id omne quod in rebus creatis fit, est materia legis oeternae. Th 1.2. q 93. art 4

Wherfore to come to the law of nature, albeit therby we sometimes meane that manner of working which God hath set for each created thing to keepe: yet for as much as those things are tearmed most properly naturall agents, which keepe the lawe of their kind vnwittingly, as the heauens and elements of the world, which can do no otherwise then they doe; and for as much as we giue vnto intellectuall natures the name of voluntary agents, that so we may distinguish them from the other▪ expedient it will be, that we seuer the law of nature obserued by the one, from that which the other is tied vnto. Touching the former, their strict keeping of one tenure statute and law is spoken of by all, but hath in it more then men haue as yet attained to know, or perhaps euer shall attaine, seeing the trauell of wading herein is giuen of God to the sonnes of men, that perceiuing how much the least thing in the world hath in it more then the wisest are able to reach vnto, they may by this meanes learne humilitie. Moses in describing the worke of creation, attributeth speech vnto God, God said, Let there be light: Let there bee afirmamēt: Let the waters vnder the heauē be gathered together into one place: Let the earth bring forth: Let there be lights in the firmament of heauen. Was this only the intent of Moses, to signifie the infinite greatnes of Gods power by the easines of his accomplishing such effects, without trauell, paine or labour? Surely it seemeth that Moses had herein besides this a further purpose, namely, first to teach that God did not worke as a necessary, but a voluntary agent, intending before hand and decreeing with himselfe that which did outwardly proceed from him: secondly to shew that God did then institute a law natural to be obserued by creatures, and therefore according to the manner of lawes, the institution thereof is described, as being established by solemne iniunction. His commaunding those things to be which are, and to be in such sort as they are, to keep that tenure and course which they do, importeth the establishment of natures law. This worlds first creation, & the preseruation since of things created, what is it but only so far forth a manifestation by execution, what the eternall lawe of God is concerning things natural? And as it cōmeth to passe in a kingdom rightly ordered, that after a law is once published, it presently takes effect far & wide, al states framing thē
               selues therunto; euen so let vs thinke it fareth in the naturall course of the world: since the time that God did first proclaime the edicts of his lawe vpon it, heauen & earth haue harkned vnto his voice, and their labour hath bene to do his will: He made a law for the raine, He gaue his decree vnto the sea, that the waters should not

passe his commandement. Now if nature should intermit her course, and leaue altogether, though it were but for a while, the obseruation of her own lawes; if those principall & mother elemēts of the world, wherof all things in this lower world are made, should loose the qualities which now they haue; if the frame of that heauenly arch erected ouer our heads should loosen & dissolue it selfe; if celestiall spheres should forget their wonted motions, and by irregular volubilitie turne themselues any way as it might happen; if the prince of the lightes of heauen, which now as a Giant doth runne his vnwearied course, should as it were through a languishing faintnes begin to stand & to rest himselfe;psal. 19.5. if the Moone should wander from her beaten way▪ the times and seasons of the yeare blend themselues by disordered and confused mixture, the winds breath out their last gaspe, the cloudes yeeld no rayne, the earth be defeated of heauenly influence; the fruites of the earth pine away as children at the withered breastes of their mother no longer able to yeeld them reliefe; what would become of man himselfe, whom these things now do all serue? See we not plainly that obedience of creatures vnto the lawe of nature is the stay of the whole world? Notwithstanding with nature it cōmeth somtimes to passe as with arte. Let Phidias haue rude & obstinate stuffe to carue, though his arte do that it should, his worke will lacke that beautie which otherwise in fitter matter it might haue had. He that striketh an instrument with skill, may cause notwithstanding a very vnpleasant sound, if the string whereon hee striketh chaunce to bee vncapable of harmonie. In the matter whereof things naturall consist, that of Theophrastus taketh place,Pheophr. in Metaph. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , much of it is oftentimes such as will by no meanes yeeld to receiue that impression which were best and most perfect. Which defect in the matter of thinges naturall, they who gaue themselues vnto the contemplation of nature amongst the heathen obserued often: but the true originall cause therof, diuine malediction, laid for the sinne of man vpon these creatures which God had made for the vse of niā; this being an article of that sauing truth which God hath reuealed vnto his Church, was aboue the reach of their meerely naturall capacitie and vnderstanding. But howsoeuer these swaruings are now and then incident into the course of nature, neuerthelesse so constantly the lawes of nature are by naturall agents obserued,Arist. Rhet. 1. cap. 39. that no man denieth but those thinges which nature worketh, are wrought either alwaies or for the most part after one and the same manner. If here it be demaunded what that is which keepeth nature in obedience to her owne lawe, wee must haue recourse to that higher lawe wherof we haue already spoken, and because all other lawes do thereon depend,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                from thence we must borrow so much as shall neede for briefe resolution in this point. Although we are not of opinion therfore, as some are, that nature in working hath before her certaine exemplary draughts or patternes, which subsisting in the bosome of the Highest, and being thence discouered, shee sixeth her eye vpon them, as trauellers by sea vpon the pole starre of the world, and that according there vnto she guideth her hand to worke by imitation: although wee rather embrace the Oracle of Hippocrates, that Each thing both in small and in great fulfilleth the taske which destenie hath set downe: and concerning the manner of executing and fulfilling the same, What they doe they knowe not, yet is it in shewe and appearance, as though they did know what they doe, and the truth is they do not discerne the

things which they looke on: neuerthelesse for as much as the works of nature are no lesse exact, then if she did both behold and studie how to expresse some absolute shape or mirror alwayes present before her; yea such her dexteritie and skill appeareth, that no intellectuall creature in the world were able by capacitie to do that which nature doth without capacitie and knowledge; it cannot bee, but nature hath some director of infinite knowledge to guide her in all her wayes.Act. 17.2
                     •
                  . Who the guide of nature, but onely the God of nature? In him wee liue, moue, and are. Those thinges which nature is said to do, are by diuine art performed, vsing nature as an instrument: nor is there any such art or knowledge diuine in nature her selfe working, but in the guide of natures worke. Whereas therefore things naturall which are not in the number of voluntary agents (for of such onely we now speake and of no other) do so necessarily obserue their certaine lawes, that as long as they keepe those Forme in other creatures, is a thing proportionable vnto the soule in liuing creatures. Sensible it is not, nor otherwise discernable, then only by effects. According to the diuersitie of inward formes, things of the world are distinguished into their kindes. formes which giue them their being, they cannot possibly be apt or inclinable to do otherwise then they doe; seeing the kindes of their operations are both constantly and exactly framed according to the seuerall ends for which they serue, they themselues in the meane while though doing that which is fit, yet knowing neither what they doe, nor why: it followeth that all which they do in this sort, proceedeth originally from some such agent, as knoweth, appointeth, holdeth vp, and euen actually frameth the same. The manner of this diuine efficiencie being farre aboue vs, we are no more able to conceiue by our reason, then creatures vnreasonable by their sense are able to apprehend after what manner we dispose and order the course of our affaires. Only thus much is discerned, that the naturall generation and processe of all thinges receiueth order of proceeding from the setled stabilitie of diuine vnderstanding. This appointeth vnto them their kinds of working, the disposition whereof in the puritie of Gods owne knowledge and will is rightly tearmed by the name of Prouidence. The same being referred vnto the things themselues here disposed by it, was woont by the auncient to bee called naturall destinie. That lawe the performance whereof we behold in things naturall, is as it were an authenticall, or an originall draught written in the bosome of God himselfe; whose spirite being to execute the same, vseth euery particular nature, euery meere naturall agent, onely as an instrument created at the beginning, and euer since the beginning vsed to worke his owne will and pleasure withall.Vide Thom. in Compend. theol, cap. 3.

                     •
                  tur, Either God doth suffer impediment, and is by a greater then himselfe hindered; or if that be impossible, then hath he determined to make a present dissolution of the world, the execution of that law beginning now to stand stil, without which the world cannot stand. This workman, whose seruitor nature is, being in truth but onely one, the Heathens imagining to be moe, gaue him in the skie the name of Iupiter, in the aire the name of Iuno, in the water the name of Neptune, in the earth the name of Vesta and sometimes of Ceres, the name of Apollo in the Sunne, in the Moone the name of Diana, the name of Aeolus and diuers other in the windes; and to conclude euen so many guides of nature they dreamed of, as they sawe there were kindes of thinges naturall in the world. These they honored, as hauing

power to worke or cease accordingly as men deserued of them. But vnto vs there is one onely guide of all agents naturall, and hee both the creator and the worker of all in all, alone to be blessed, adored and honoured by all for euer. That which hitherto hath beene spoken, concerneth naturall agents considered in themselues. But we must further remember also (which thing to touch in a word shall suffice) that as in this respect they haue their law, which lawe directeth them in the meanes whereby they tende to their owne perfection. So likewise an other lawe there is, which toucheth them as they are sociable partes vnited into one body; a lawe which bindeth them each to serue vnto others good, and all to preferre the good of the whole before whatsoeuer their owne particular; as we plainely see they doe, when things naturall in that regard forget their ordinary naturall woont, that which is heauie mounting sometime vpwardes of it owne accord, and forsaking the center of the earth, which to it selfe is most naturall, euen as if it did heare it selfe commaunded to let goe the good it priuately wisheth, and to relieue the present distresse of nature in common.
            * But now that wee may lift vp our eyes (as it were) from the footstoole to the throne of God, and leauing these naturall,The law which Angels doe worke by. Psal. 104.4. Heb. 1.7. Eph. 3.10. consider a little the state of heauenly and diuine creatures; touching Angels which are spirits immateriall and intellectuall, the glorious inhabitants of those sacred pallaces, where nothing but light and blessed immortalitie, no shadow of matter for teares, discontentments, griefes, and vncomfortable passions to worke vpon, but all ioy▪ tranquilitie, and peace, euen for euer and euer doth dwell;Dan. 7.10. Matth. 26.53. as in number and order they are huge, mightie, and royall armies; so likewise in perfection of obedience vnto that lawe, which the Highest, whom they adore, loue, and imitate,Heb. 12.22. Luc. 2.13. hath imposed vpon them, such obseruantes they are thereof, that our Sauiour himselfe being to set downe the perfect idea of that which wee are to pray and wish for on earth, did not teach to pray or wish for more, then onely that heere it might be with vs, as with them it is in heauen.Matth. 6.10. God which mooueth meere naturall agents as an efficient onely, doth otherwise mooue intellectuall creatures, and especially his holy Angels. For beholding the face of God,Matth. 18.10. in admiration of so great excellencie they all adore him; and being rapt with the loue of his beautie, they cleaue inseparably for euer vnto him.Psal. 91.11.12. Luc. 15.7. Desire to resemble him in goodnesse, maketh them vnweariable,Heb. 1.14. and euen vnsatiable in their longing to doe by all meanes all maner good vnto all the creatures of God,Act. 10.3. Dan. 9.23. but especially vnto the children of men; in the countenance of whose nature looking downeward they behold themselues beneath themselues,Matth. 1

                euen as vpwarde in God, beneath whom themselues are, they see that character which is no where but in themselues and vs resembled. Thus farre euen the Painims haue approched; thus farre they haue seene into the doings of the Angels of God; Orpheus confessing, that the fiery throne of God is attended on by those most industrious Angels, carefull how all things are performed amongst men; and the mirror of humaine wisedome plainely teaching, that God mooueth Angels, euen as that thing doth stirre mans heart, which is thereunto presented amiable.Arist. Metaph. 12. cap. 7.

Of Angels wee are not to consider onely what they are, and doe, in regard of their owne being; but that also which concerneth them as they are lincked into a kinde of corporation amongst themselues, and of societie or fellowship with men. Consider Angels each of them seuerally in himself, and their law is that which the Prophet Dauid mentioneth, All ye his Angels praise him. Consider the Angels of God associated,psal. 148.2. Luk. 2.13. and their lawe is that which disposeth them as an Army, one in order and degree aboue an other.Matth▪ 26.53. psal. 148.2. Consider finally the Angels as hauing with vs that communion which the Apostle to the Hebrewes noteth,Heb. 12.22. and in regard whereof Angels haue not disdained to professe themselues our fellowseruants; from hence there springeth vp a third law,Apoc, 22.9. which bindeth them to workes of ministeriall imployment. Euery of which their seuerall functions are by them performed with ioy. A part of the Angels of God notwithstanding (we know) haue fallen, and that their fall hath beene through the voluntary breach of that lawe, which did require at their hands continuance in the exercise of their high and admirable vertue. Impossible it was that euer their will should chaunge or incline to remit any part of their dutie, without some obiect hauing force to auert their conceit from God, and to draw it an other way; and that before they attained that high perfection of blisse, wherein now the elect Angels are without possibilitie of falling. Of any thing more then of God they could not by any meanes like, as long as whatsoeuer they knew besides God, they apprehended it not in it selfe without dependencie vpon God; because so long God must needes seeme infinitely better then any thing which they so could apprehend. Thinges beneath them could not in such sort be presented vnto their eyes, but that therein they must needs see alwayes how those things did depend on God. It seemeth therefore that there was no other way for Angels to sinne, but by reflex of their vnderstanding vpon themselues; when being held with admiration of their owne sublimitie and honor, the memorie of their subordination vnto God and their dependencie on him was drowned in this conceipt; whereupon their adoration, loue, and imitation of God, could not choose but be also interrupted. The fall of Angels therefore was pride. Since their fall, their practises haue beene the cleane contrary vnto those before mentioned. For being dispersed some in the ayre,Ioh. 8.44▪ 1. pet. 5.8. some on the earth, some in the water, some amongest the minerals, dennes,Apoc. 9.11. Gen. 3.15. and caues, that are vnder the earth: they haue by all meanes laboured to effect an vniuersall rebellion against the lawes, and as farre as in them lyeth, vtter destruction of the workes of God.1. Chr. 21, 1, Iob. 1.7, & 2, 5 These wicked Spirites the Heathens honoured in stead of Gods,Ioh. 13, 27, both generally vnder the name of Dii inferi Gods infernall;Act. 5, 3, Apoc.

Thus much therefore may suffice for Angels, the next vnto whom in degree are men.

                then now they are. All which perfections are contained vnder the generall name of Goodnesse. And because there is not in the world any thing wherby another may not some way be made the perfecter, therefore all things that are, are good. Againe sith there can be no goodnesse desired which proceedeth not from God himselfe, as from the supreme cause of all things; and euerie effect doth after a sort conteine, at least wise resemble the cause from which it proceedeth: all things in the world are sayd in some sort to seeke the highest,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . and to couet more or lesse the participation of God himselfe. Yet this doth no where so much appeare as it doth in man:Arist. de an. lib. 2. cap. 4. because there are so many kindes of perfections which man seeketh. The first degree of goodnesse is that generall perfection which all things do seeke▪ in desiring the continuance of their beeing. All thinges therefore coueting as much as may be to be like vnto God in being euer, that which cannot hereunto attaine personally, doth seeke to continue it selfe another way, that is by ofspring and propagation. The next degree of goodnesse, is that which each thing coueteth by affecting resemblance with God, in the constancy and excellencie of those operations which belong vnto their kind. The immutabilitie of God they striue vnto, by working either alwayes or for the most part after one and the same manner; his absolute exactnes they imitate, by tending vnto that which is most exquisite in euery particular.

Concerning perfections in this kind, that by proceeding in the knowledge of truth, and by growing in the exercise of vertue, man amongst the creatures of this inferiour world, aspireth to the greatest conformity with God;Matth. 5.48. Sap. 7.27. this is not only knowne vnto vs, whom he himselfe hath so instructed, but euen they do acknowledge, who amongst men are not iudged the neerest vnto him.

            6 In the matter of knowledge, there is betweene the Angels of God and the children of men this difference.Mens first beginning to grow to the knowledge of that law which the
                     •
                   are to obserue. vide Isa. 7.16. Angels alreadie haue full and complete

knowledge in the highest degree that can be imparted vnto them: men if we view them in their spring, are at the first without vnderstanding or knowledge at all. Neuerthelesse from this vtter vacuitie they grow by degrees, till they come at length to be euen as the Angels themselues are. That which agreeth to the one now, the other shall attaine vnto in the end; they are not so farre disioyned and seuered, but that they come at length to meete. The soule of man being therefore at the first as a booke, wherein nothing is, and yet all thinges may be imprinted; we are to search by what steppes and degrees it riseth vnto perfection of knowledge. Vnto that which hath bene alreadie set downe concerning naturall agents this we must adde, that albeit therein we haue comprised as well creatures liuing, as void of life, if they be in degree of nature beneath men; neuerthelesse a difference we must obserue betweene those naturall agents that worke altogether vnwittingly, and those which haue though weake, yet some vnderstanding what they do, as fishes, foules, and beasts haue. Beasts are in sensible capacitie as ripe euen as men themselues, perhaps more ripe. For as stones, though in dignitie of nature inferior vnto plants, yet exceed them in firmenesse of strength or durability of being; and plants though beneath the excellency of creatures indued with sense, yet exceed them in the faculty of vegetation and of fertility: so beasts though otherwise behind men, may notwithstanding in actions of sense and phancie go beyond them; because the endeuors of nature, when it hath an higher perfection to seeke, are in lower the more remisse, not esteeming thereof so much as those things do, which haue no better proposed vnto them. The soule of man therefore being capable of a more diuine perfection, hath (besides the faculties of growing vnto sensible knowledge which is common vnto vs with beasts) a further hability▪ whereof in thē there is no shew at all,

                  all demonstration the ability of reaching higher then vnto sensible things. Till we grow to some ripenesse of yeares, the soule of man doth only store it selfe with conceipts of things of inferiour and more open qualitie, which afterwards do serue as instruments vnto that which is greater: in the meane while aboue the reach of meaner creatures it ascendeth not. When once it comprehendeth any thing aboue this, as the differences of time, affirmations, negations▪ and contradictions in speech; we then count it to haue some vse of naturall reason. Whereunto if afterwards there might be added the right helpes of true art and learning, (which helpes I must plainely confesse this age of the world, carying the name of a learned age, doth neither much know nor greatly regard) there would vndoubtedly be almost as great difference in maturitie of iudgement betweene men therewith inured, and that which now men are, as betweene men that are now and innocents. Which speech if any condemne, as being ouer hyperbolicall, let them consider but this one thing. No art is at the first finding out so perfect as industrie may after make it. Yet the very first man that to any purpose knew the way we speake of and followed it, hath alone thereby performed more very neere in all parts of naturall knowledge, then sithence in any one part thereof, the whole world besides hath done. In the pouertie of that other new deuised aide, two things there are notwithstanding singular.A

because the curiositie of mans wit, doth many times with perill wade farther in the search of things, then were conuenient: the same is thereby restrained vnto such generalities▪ as euery where offering themselues, are apparant vnto men of the weakest conceipt that need be. So as following the rules & precepts thereof, we may find it to be, an Art which teacheth the way of speedy discourse, and restraineth the minde of man that it may not waxe ouer wise. Education and instruction are the meanes, the one by vse, the other by precept, to make our naturall faculty of reason, both the better and the sooner able to iudge rightly betweene truth and error, good and euill. But at what time a man may be sayd to haue attained so farre foorth the vse of reason, as sufficeth to make him capable of those lawes, whereby he is thē bound to guide his actions; this is a great deale more easie for common sense to discerne, then for any man by skill and learning to determine: euen as it is not in Philosophers, who best know the nature both of fire and of gold, to teach what degree of the one will serue to purifie the other, so well as the artisan (who doth this by fire) discerneth by sense when the fire hath that degree of heate which sufficeth for his purpose.
            7 By reason man attaineth vnto the knowledge of things that are and are not sensible:Of mans will which is the thing that lawes of action are made to guide. It resteth therfore that we search how mā attaineth vnto the knowledge of such things vnsensible, as are to be knowne that they may be done. Seeing then that nothing can moue vnlesse there be some end, the desire whereof prouoketh vnto motion; how should that diuine power of the soule, that Spirit of our mind as the Apostle termeth it, euer stir it selfe vnto action,Eph. 4.23. vnlesse it haue also the like spurre? The end for which we are moued to worke, is somtimes the goodnes which we conceiue of the very working it selfe, without any further respect at all; and the cause that procureth action is the meere desire of action, no other good besides being thereby intended.Salust. Of certaine turbulent wits it is said, Illis quieta mouere magna merces videbatur, They thought the very disturbāce of things established an hyre sufficient to set them on worke. Sometimes that which we do is referred to a further end, without the desire whereof we would leaue the same vndone, as in their actions that gaue almes to purchase thereby the prayse of men.Matth. 6.2. Man in perfection of nature being made according to the likenes of his maker, resembleth him also in the maner of working; so that whatsoeuer we worke as men, the same we do wittingly worke and freely; neither are we according to the maner of naturall agents any way so tied, but that it is in our power to leaue the things we do vndone. The good which either is gotten by doing, or which consisteth in the very doing it selfe, causeth not action, vnlesse apprehending it as good, we so like and desire it. That we do vnto any such ende, the same we choose and preferre before the leauing of it vndone. Choice there is not, vnlesse the thing which we take, be so in our power that we might haue refused and left it. If fire consume the stubble, it chooseth not so to do, because the nature thereof is such that it can do no other. To choose is to will one thing before another. And to will is to bend our soules to the hauing or doing of that which they see to be good. Goodnesse is seene with the eye of the vnderstanding. And the light of that eye, is reason. So that two principall fountaines there are of humaine action, Knowledge and Will; which will in things

tending towards any end is termed Choice. Concerning knowledge, Behold sayth Moses,
               Deut. 30.19. 
               I haue set before you this day good and euill, life and death. Concerning Will, he addeth immediatly, Choose life; that is to say, the things that tend vnto life, them choose. But of one thing we must haue speciall care, as being a matter of no small moment, and that is, how the will properly and strictly taken, as it is of things which are referred vnto the end that man desireth, differeth greatly from that inferiour naturall desire which we call appetite. The obiect of appetite is whatsoeuer sensible good may be wished for; the obiect of wil is that good which reason doth leade vs to seeke. Affections, as ioy, and griefe, and feare, and anger, with such like, being as it were the sundry fashions and formes of appetite, can neither rise at the conceipt of a thing indifferent, nor yet choose but rise at the sight of some things. Wherefore it is not altogether in our power, whether we will be stirred with affections or no: whereas actions which issue from the dispositiō of the wil, are in the power therof to be performed or staied. Finally appetite is the wils sollicitor, and the will is appetites controller; what we couet according to the one, by the other we often reiect: neither is any other desire termed properly will, but that where reason and vnderstanding, or the shew of reason, prescribeth the thing desired. It may be therfore a question, whether those operations of men are to be counted voluntary, wherein that good which is sensible prouoketh appetite, and appetite causeth action, reason being neuer called to councell; as when we eate or drinke, or betake our selues vnto rest, and such like. The truth is, that such actions in men hauing attained to the vse of reason are voluntary. For as the authoritie of higher powers hath force euen in those things which are done without their priuitie, and are of so meane reckening that to acquaint them therewith it needeth not: in like sort voluntarily we are said to do that also▪ which the will if it listed might hinder from being done, although about the doing thereof we do not expressely vse our reason or vnderstanding, and so immediatly apply our wils thereunto. In cases therefore of such facility, the will doth yeeld her assent, as it were with a kind of silence, by not dissenting; in which respect her force is not so apparant, as in expresse mandates or prohibitions, especially vpon aduice and consultation going before. Where vnderstanding therefore needeth, in those things reason is the director of mans will, by discouering in action what is good. For the lawes of well doing are the dictates of right reason. Children which are not as yet come vnto those yeares whereat they may haue; againe innocentes which are excluded by naturall defect from euer hauing; thirdly mad men which for the present cannot possibly haue the vse of right reason to guide themselues, haue for their guide the reason that guideth other men, which are tutors ouer them to seeke and to procure their good for them. In the rest there is that light of reason, whereby good may be knowne from euill, and which discouering the same rightly is termed right. The will notwithstanding doth not incline to haue or do that which reason teacheth to be good, vnlesse the same do also teach it to be possible. For albeit the appetite, being more generall, may wish any thing which seemeth good,O mihi praeter
                     •
                  tos referat si Iupiter annos. be it neuer so impossible: yet for such things the reasonable will of man doth neuer seeke. Let reason reach impossibilitie in any thing, and the will of man doth let it go; a thing impossible it doth not

affect, the impossibility thereof being manifest. There is in the will of man naturally that freedome, whereby it is apt to take or refuse any particular obiect whatsoeuer being presented vnto it. Whereupon it followeth; th

Now pursuit & refusall in the will do follow, the one the affirmation, the other the negation of goodnes; which the vnderstanding apprehendeth▪ grounding it selfe vpon sense, vnlesse some higher reason do chance to teach the cōtrary.

Our felicitie therefore being the obiect and accomplishment of our desire, we cannot choose but wish and couet it. All particular things which are subiect vnto action, the will doth so farre foorth incline vnto, as reason iudgeth them the better for vs, and consequently the more auaileable to our blisse. If reason erre, we fall into euill, and are so farre forth depriued of the generall perfection we seeke. Seeing therefore that for the framing of mens actions the knowledge of good from euill is necessarie; it onely resteth that we search how this may be had. Neither must we suppose that there needeth one rule to know the good,

For he that knoweth what is straight, doth euen thereby discerne what is crooked, because the absence of straightnesse in bodies capable thereof is crookednesse. Goodnesse in actions is like vnto straitnesse▪ wherfore that which is done well we terme right. For as the straight way is most acceptable to him that trauaileth, because by it he commeth soonest to his iourneys end: so in action, that which doth lye the euenest betweene vs and the end we desire, must needes be the fittest for our vse. Besides which fitnes for vse, there is also in rectitude, beauty; as contrariwise in obliquity, deformity. And that which is good in the actions of men, doth not onely delight as profitable, but as amiable also. In which consideration the Grecians most diuinely haue giuen to the actiue perfection of men, a name expressing both beauty and goodnesse,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . because goodnesse in ordinary speech is for the most part applied onely to that which is beneficiall. But we in the name of goodnesse, do here imploy both. And of discerning goodnes there are but these two wayes; the one the knowledge of the causes whereby it is made such; the other the obseruation of those signes and tokens, which being annexed alwaies vnto goodnes, argue that where they are found, there also goodnes is, although we know not the cause by force whereof it is there. The former of these is the most sure & infallible way, but so hard that all shunne it, and had rather walke as men do in the darke by hap hazard, then tread so long and intricate mazes for knowledge sake. As therefore Physitians are many times forced to leaue such methods of curing as themselues know to be the fittest, and being ouerruled by their patients impatiency are fame to try the best they can, in taking that way of cure, which the cured will yeeld vnto: in like sort, cōsidering how the case doth stād with this present age full of tongue & weake of braine, behold we yeeld to the streame thereof; into the causes of goodnes we will not make any curious or deepe inquiry; to touch them now & then it shalbe sufficient, when they are so neere at hand that easily they may be conceiued without any farre remoued discourse: that way we are contented to proue, which being the worse in it selfe, is

notwithstanding now by reason of common imbecillity the fitter & likelier to be brookt. Signes and tokens to know good by, are of sundry kinds: some more certaine▪ and some lesse. The most certaine token of euident goodnesse is, if the generall perswasion of all men do so account it. And therefore a common receiued error is neuer vtterly ouerthrowne, till such time as we go from signes vnto causes, and shew some manifest root or fountaine thereof common vnto all, whereby it may clearly appeare how it hath come to passe that so many haue bene ouerseene. In which case surmises and sleight probabilities will not serue; because the vniuersall consent of men is the perfectest and strongest in this kind which comprehendeth onely the signes and tokens of goodnesse. Things casuall do varie, and that which a man doth but chaunce to thinke well of, cannot still haue the like hap. Wherefore although we know not the cause, yet thus much we may know, that some necessary cause there is, whensoeuer the iudgements of all men generally or for the most part run one & the same way, especially in matters of naturall discourse. For of things necessarily & naturally done there is no more affirmed but this,

For that which all men haue at all times learned, nature her selfe must needes haue taught; and God being the author of nature, her voyce is but his instrument. By her from him we receiue whatsoeuer in such sort we learne. Infinite duties there are, the goodnes wherof is by this rule sufficiently manifested, although we had no other warrant besides to approue them. The Apostle S. Paul hauing speech cōcerning the Heathen saith of thē, Rom. 2.14. 
               They are a law vnto thēselues▪
                His meaning is, that by force of the light of reasō, wherewith God illuminateth euery one which cometh into the world, mē being inabled to know truth from falshood, and good from euill, do thereby learne in many things what the will of God is; which will himselfe not reuealing by any extraordinary meanes vnto them, but they by naturall discourse attaining the knowledge thereof, seeme the makers of those lawes which indeed are his, and they but onely the finders of them out. A law therefore generally taken, is a directiue rule vnto goodnesse of operation. The rule of diuine operations outward, is the definitiue appointmēt of Gods owne wisedome set downe within himselfe. The rule of naturall agents that worke by simple necessity, is the determination of the wisedome of God▪ known to God himselfe the principall director of them, but not vnto them that are directed to execute the same. The rule of naturall agents which worke after a sort of their owne accord, as the beasts do, is the iudgement of common sense or phancy concerning the sensible goodnes of those obiects wherwith they are moued. The rule of ghostly or immateriall natures, as spirits & Angels, is their intuitiue intellectual iudgement concerning the amiable beauty & high goodnes of that obiect, which with vnspeakeable ioy and delight doth set them on worke. The rule of voluntary agents on earth, is the sentence that reason giueth cōcerning the goodnes of those things which they are to do. And the sentences which reason giueth, are some more, some lesse general, before it come to define in particular actiōs what is good. The maine principles of reason are in thēselues apparent. For to make nothing euidēt of it selfe vnto mās vnderstāding, were to take away al possibility of knowing any thing. And herein that of Theophras

               They that seeke a reason of all things do vtterly ouerthrow reason. In euery kind of knowledge some such grounds there are, as that being proposed, the mind doth presently embrace them as free from all possibilitie of error, cleare and manifest without proofe. In which kind, axiomes or principles more generall are such as this, That the greater good is to be chosen before the lesse. If therefore it should be demanded, what reason there is why the will of man, which doth necessarily shun harme and couet whatsoeuer is pleasant and sweete, should be commanded to count the pleasures of sinne gall, & notwithstanding the bitter accidents wherwith vertuous actions are compast, yet stil to reioyce and delight in them; surely this could neuer stand with reason: but that wisedome thus prescribing, groundeth her lawes vpon an infallible rule of comparison, which is, that small difficulties, when exceeding great good is sure to ensue; and on the other side momentanie benefites, when the hurt which they drawe after them is vnspeakeable, are not at all to be respected. This rule is the ground whereupon the wisedom of the Apostle buildeth a law, inioyning patience vnto himselfe; The present lightnes of our affliction worketh vnto vs euen with aboundance vpon aboundance an eternall waight of glory,

               while we looke not on the things which are seene, but on the things which are not seene. For the things which are seene are temporal, but the things which are not seene eternall. Therefore Christianity to be embraced, whatsoeuer calamities in those times it was accompanied withall. Vpon the same ground our Sauiour proueth the law most reasonable, that doth forbid those crimes which mē for gaines sake fall into. For a man to win the world, if it be with the losse of his soule,Matth. 16.26. what benefit or good is it? Axiomes lesse generall, yet so manifest that they need no further proofe, are such as these, God to be worshipped, Parents to be honored, Others to be vsed by vs as we our selues would by them. Such things, as soone as they are alleaged, all men acknowledge to be good; they require no proofe or further discourse to be assured of their goodnes. Notwithstanding whatsoeuer such principle there is, it was at the first found out by discourse, & drawne from out of the very bowels of heauen and earth. For we are to note, that things in the world are to vs discernable, not onely so farre forth as serueth for our vitall preseruation, but further also in a twofold higher respect. For first if all other vses were vtterly taken away; yet the mind of man being by nature speculatiue and delighted with cōtemplation in it selfe, they were to be known euen for meere knowledge and vnderstandings sake. Yea further besides this, the knowledge of euery the least thing in the whole world, hath in it a secōd peculiar benefit vnto vs, in as much as it serueth to minister rules, Canons, and lawes for men to direct those actions by, which we properly terme humane. This did the very Heathens themselues obscurely insinuate, by making Themis which we call Ius or Right to be the daughter of heauen and earth. Wee knowe things either as they are in themselues, or as they are in mutuall relation one to another. The knowledge of that which man is in reference vnto himselfe, and other things in relation vnto man, I may iustly terme the mother of al those principles, which are as it were edicts, statutes, and decrees in that law of nature, wherby humaine actions are framed. First therefore hauing obserued that the best things, where they are not hindered, do still produce the best operations; (for which cause where many things are to concurre vnto one effect, the best is in all congruity

of reason to guide the residue, that it preuailing most, the worke principally done by it may haue greatest perfection:) when hereupon we come to obserue in our selues, of what excellencie our soules are in comparison of our bodies, and the diuiner part in relation vnto the baser of our soules; seeing that all these concurre in producing humaine actions, it cannot be well vnlesse the chiefest do commaund and direct the rest.Arist.

                  . cap. 5. The soule then ought to conduct the bodie, and the spirit of our mindes the soule. This is therefore the first lawe, whereby the highest power of the minde requireth generall obedience at the hands of all the rest concurring with it vnto action. Touching the seuerall graund mandates, which being imposed by the vnderstanding facultie of the minde, must be obeyed by the will of man, they are by the same method found out, whether they import our dutie towardes God or towards man. Touching the one, I may not here stand to open, by what degrees of discourse the mindes euen of meere naturall men, haue attained to knowe, not onely that there is a God, but also what power, force, wisedome, and other properties that God hath, and how all thinges depend on him. This being therefore presupposed, from that knowne relation which God hath vnto vs

               First and the great Commaundement. Touching the next, which as our Sauiour addeth, is like vnto this (he meaneth in amplitude and largenesse▪ in as much as it is the roote out of which all laws of dutie to men-ward haue growne, as out of the former all offices of religion towards God) the like naturall inducement hath brought men to know, that it is their duty no lesse to loue others then themselues. For seeing those things which are equall, must needes all haue one measure: if I cannot but wish to receiue al good, euen as much at euery mans hand as any man can wish vnto his owne soule; how should I looke to haue any part of my desire herein satisfied, vnlesse my self be careful to satisfie the like desire, which is vndoubtedly in other men, we all being of one and the same nature? To haue any thing offered them repugnant to this desire, must needs in all respects grieue them as much as me: so that if I do harme, I must looke to suffer; there being no reason that others should shew greater measure of loue to me, then they haue by me shewed vnto them. My desire therefore to be loued of my equals in nature as much as possible may be, imposeth vpon me a naturall dutie of bearing to them-ward fully the like affection. From which relation of equalitie betweene our selues and them that are as our selues, what seuerall rules and Canons naturall reason hath drawne for direction of life, no man is ignorant; as namely, Quod quis in se approbat, in alio reprobare nō posse.

not altogether so necessary,Matth. 22.40. On these two commandements hangeth the whole law. seeing that on these two generall heads alreadie mentioned all other specialties are dependent. Wherefore the naturall measure wherby to iudge our doings, is the sentence of reason, determining and setting downe what is good to be done. Which sentence is either mandatory, shewing what must be done; or else permissiue, declaring onely what may be done; or thirdly admonitorie, opening what is the most conuenient for vs to doe. The first taketh place, where the comparison doth stand altogether betweene doing and not doing of one thing which in it selfe is absolutely good or euill; as it had bene for Ioseph to yeeld or not to yeeld to the impotent desire of his lewd mistresse,Gen. 39.9. the one euill, the other good simply. The second is, when of diuerse things euill, all being not euitable, we are permitted to take one; which one sauing only in case of so great vrgency were not otherwise to be taken;Mar. 10.4. as in the matter of diuorce amongst the Iewes. The last, when of diuers things good, one is principall and most eminent;Act. 4.37. Act. 5.4. as in their act who sould their possessions and layd the price at the Apostles feete, which possessions they might haue retained vnto themselues without sinne; againe in the Apostle S. Paules owne choyce to maintaine himselfe by his owne labour,

                  . Thes. 3.8. whereas in liuing by the Churches maintenance, as others did, there had bene no offence committed. In goodnes therefore there is a latitude or extent, whereby it commeth to passe that euen of good actions some are better then other some; whereas otherwise one man could not excell another, but all should be either absolutely good, as hitting iumpe that indiuisible point or Center wherein goodnesse consisteth; or else missing it they should be excluded out of the number of wel-doers. Degrees of wel doing there could be none, except perhaps in the seldomnes & oftennes of doing well. But the nature of goodnesse being thus ample, a lawe is properly that which reason in such sort defineth to be good that it must be done. And the law of reason or humaine nature is that, which men by discourse of naturall reason haue rightly found out themselues to be all for euer bound vnto in their actions. Lawes of reason haue these markes to be knowne by. Such as keepe them, resemble most liuely in their voluntarie actions, that very manner of working which nature her selfe doth necessarily obserue in the course of the whole world. The workes of nature are all behoouefull, beautifull, without superfluitie or defect: euen so theirs, if they be framed according to that which the law of reason teacheth. Secondly those lawes are inuestigable by reason, without the helpe of reuelation supernaturall and diuine. Finally in such sort they are inuestigable, that the knowledge of them is generall, the world hath alwayes bene acquainted with them; according to that which one in Sophocles obserueth corcerning a branch of this law,

It is not agreed vpon by one, or two, or few, but by all: which we may not so vnderstand, as if euery particular man in the whole world did know and confesse whatsoeuer the law of reason doth conteine; but this lawe is such that being proposed no man can reiect it as vnreasonable and vniust. Againe there is nothing in it, but any man (hauing naturall perfection of wit, and ripenesse of iudgement) may by labour and trauaile find out. And to conclude, the generall principles thereof are such, as it is not easie to find men ignorant of them. Law rationall therefore,

which men commonly vse to call the law of nature, meaning thereby the law which humaine nature knoweth it selfe in reason vniuersally bound vnto, which also for that cause may be termed most fitly the lawe of reason▪ this law, I say, comprehendeth all those things which men by the light of their naturall vnderstanding euidently know, or at least wife may know, to be beseeming or vnbeseeming, vertuous or vitious; good or euill for them to do.Th. 1.2. q. 94. art. 3.

Now although it be true, which some haue said, that whatsoeuer is done amisse, the law of nature and reason therby is transgrest; because euen those offences which are by their speciall qualities breaches of supernaturall lawes, do also, for that they are generally euill violate in generall that principle of reason, which willeth vniuersally to flie from euill: yet do we not therfore so far extend the law of reason, as to conteine in it all maner lawes whereunto reasonable creatures are bound; but (as hath bene shewed) we restraine it to those onely duties, which all men by force of naturall wit either do or might vnderstand to be such duties as concerne all men. Certaine half waking men there are, (as Saint Augustine noteth) who neither altogether asleepe in folly, nor yet throughly awake in the light of true vnderstanding, haue thought that there is not at all any thing iust and righteous in it selfe: but looke wherwith nations are inured, the same they take to be right and iust. Wherupon their conclusion is, that seeing each sort of people hath a different kind of right from other, and that which is right of it owne nature must be euery where one and the same, therefore in it selfe there is nothing right. These good folke (saith he, that I may not trouble their wits with rehearsal of too many things) haue not looked so far into the world as to perceiue, that Do as thou wouldest be done vnto, is a sentence which all nations vnder heauen are agreed vpon. Refer this sentence to the loue of God, & it extinguisheth all heinous crimes▪ referre it to the loue of thy neighbor, and all grieuous wrongs it banisheth out of the world. Wherefore as touching the law of reason, this was (it seemeth) Saint Augustines iudgement, namely, that there are in it some things which stand as principles vniuersally agreed vpon: and that out of those principles, which are in themselues euident, the greatest morall duties we owe towards God or man, may without any great difficultie be concluded. If then it be here demaunded, by what meanes it should come to passe (the greatest part of the law morall being so easie for all men to know) that so many thousands of men notwithstanding haue bene ignorant euen of principall morall duties, not imagining the breach of them to be sinne: I deny not but lewd and wicked custome; beginning perhaps at the first amongst few, afterwards spreading into greater multitudes, and so continuing from time to time, may be of force euen in plaine things to smother the light of naturall vnderstanding, because men will not bend their wits to examine, whether things wherewith they haue bene accustomed, be good or euill. For examples sake, that grosser kind of heathenish idolatrie, wherby they worshipped the very workes of their owne hands, was an absurdity to reason so palpable, that the Prophet Dauid comparing idols and idolaters together, maketh almost no ods betweene them, but the one in a maner as much without wit and sense as the other, They that make them are like vnto them, and so are all that trust in them. That wherein an idolater doth seeme so absurb and foolish,Psal. 35.18. is by the Wiseman thus exprest, He is not ashamed to speake vnto that which hath no life,

               When a father mourned grieuosly for his son that was taken away suddenly, he made an image for him that was once dead, whom now he worshipped as a God, ordeining to his seruants ceremonies & sacrifices. Thus by processe of time this wicked custome preuailed, & was kept as a law; the authority of Rulers, the ambition of craftsmen, and such like meanes thrusting forward the ignorant, and increasing their superstition. Vnto this which the Wiseman hath spoken, somwhat besides may be added. For whatsoeuer we haue hitherto taught, or shal hereafter, cōcerning the force of mans naturall vnderstanding, this we alwayes desire withall to be vnderstood, that there is no kind of faculty or power in man or any other creature, which can rightly performe the functions alotted to it, without perpetuall aide & concurrence of that supreme cause of all things. The benefit whereof as oft as we cause God in his iustice to withdraw, there can no other thing follow▪ then that which the Apostle noteth, euen men indued with the light of reason to walke notwithstanding in the vanity of their mind, hauing their cogitations darkned
               Eph. 4.17. 
               & being strangers from the life of God through the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardnes of their harts. And this cause is mētioned by the Prophet Esay
               ▪ speaking of the ignorance idolaters, who see not how the manifest reason condemneth their grosse iniquity and sinne.Esay. 44.19.18. They haue not in them, saith he▪ so much wit as to thinke, shall I bow to the stocke of a tree? All knowledge and vnderstanding is taken from them. For God hath shut their eyes that they cannot see. That which we say in this case of idolatry, serueth for all other things, wherein the like kind of generall blindnes hath preuailed against the manifest lawes of reason. Within the compasse of which lawes we do not onely comprehend whatsoeuer may be easily knowne to belong to the duty of all men; but euen whatsoeuer may possibly be known to be of that quality, so that the same be by necessary consequence deduced out of cleere and manifest principles. For if once we descend vnto probable collections what is conuenient for men, we are then in the territory where free and arbitrarie determinations, the territory where humane lawes take place, which lawes are after to be considered.
            
               The benefit of keeping that law which reason teacheth.9 Now the due obseruation of this law which reason teacheth vs, cannot but be effectuall vnto their great good that obserue the same. For we see the whole world and each part thereof so compacted, that as long as each thing performeth onely that worke which is naturall vnto it, it thereby preserueth both other things, and also it selfe. Contrariwise let any principall thing, as the Sun, the Moone, any one of the heauēs or elemēts, but once cease or faile, or swarue; and who doth not easily conceiue, that the sequele thereof would be ruine both to it selfe, & whatsoeuer dependeth on it? And is it possible that man, being not only the noblest creature in the world, but euen a very world in himselfe, his transgressing the law of his nature should draw no maner of harme after it? Yes, tribulation and anguish vnto euerie soule that doth euill. Good doth followe vnto all things by obseruing the course of their nature, and on the contrarie side euill by not obseruing it: but not vnto naturall agents that good which wee call Reward, not that euill which wee properly tearme Punishment. The reason whereof is, because amongst creatures in this world, onely mans obseruation of the lawe of his nature is Righteousnesse, onely mans transgression Sinne.
               
And the reason of this is the difference in his maner of obseruing or transgressing the lawe of his nature. Hee doth not otherwise then voluntarily the one or the other. What we do against our wils, or constrainedly, we are not properly said to do it, because the mo

For which cause, no man did euer thinke the hurtfull actions of furious men and innocents to be punishable. Againe some things wee doe neither against nor without, and yet not simply and meerely with our wils; but with our wils in such sor

It is no excuse therefore vnto him, who being drunke committeth incest, and alleageth that his wits were not his owne, in as much as himselfe might haue chosen whether his wits should by that meane haue been taken from him. Now rewards and punishments do alwaies presuppose some thing willingly done well or ill▪ without which respect though we may sometimes receiue good or harme, yet then the one is only a benefite, and not a reward; the other simply an hurt, not a punishment. From the sundry dispositions of mans will, which is the roote of all his actions, there groweth varietie in the sequeie of rewards and punishments, which are by these and the like rules measured: Take away the will, and all actes are equall: That which we doe not and would doe, is commonly accepted as done.

               10 That which hitherto wee haue set downe, is (I hope) sufficient to shew their brutishnes,How reason doth leade men vnto the making of humane lawes, whereby politique societies are gouerned, and to agreement about lawes, whereby the fellowship or communion of independent societies stādeth.

Rhet. 1 which imagine that religion and vertue are only as men wil accompt of them; that we might make as much accompt, if we would, of the contrarie, without any harme vnto our selues, and that in nature they are as indifferent one as the other. Wee see then how nature it selfe teacheth lawes and statutes to liue by. The lawes which haue bene hitherto mentioned, doe bind men absolutely, euen as they are mē, although they haue neuer any setled fellowship, neuer any solemne agreemēt amongst themselues what to doe or not to do. But for as much as we are not by our selues sufficient, to furnish our selues with competent store of thinges needfull for such a life as our nature doth desire, a life fit for the dignitie of man: therefore to supply those defectes and imperfections which are in vs liuing single and solely by our selues, wee are naturally induced to seeke communion and fellowship with others. This was the cause of mens vniting themselues at the first in politique societies; which societies could not bee without gouernment, nor gouernment without a distinct kind of law from that which hath bene alreadie declared. Two foundations there are which beare vp publique societies; the one, a naturall inclination, wherby al men desire sociable life & fellowship; the other, an order expresly or secretly agreed vpon, touching the manner of their vnion in liuing together. The later is that which wee call the law of a common weale, the very soule of a politique body, the parts whereof are by law animated, held together, and set on worke in such actions as the common good requireth. Lawes politique, ordained for externall order and regiment amongst men, are neuer framed as they should be, vnlesse presuming the will of man to be inwardly obstinate, rebellious, and auerse from all obediēce vnto the sacred lawes of his nature
                  •
                in a word, vnlesse presuming man to be in regard of his depraued minde little better then a wild beast, they do accordingly prouide notwithstanding so to frame his outward actions, that they bee no hinderance vnto the common good for which societies are instituted: vnlesse they doe this, they are not perfect. It resteth therefore that we consider how nature findeth out such lawes of gouernmēt, as serue to direct euen nature depraued to a right end. All men desire to lead in this world an happie life. That life is led most happily, wherein all vertue is exercised without impedimēt or let.1. Tim. 6.8. The Apostle in exhorting men to contentment, although they haue in this world no more then very bare food and raiment, giueth vs thereby to vnderstand, that those are euen the lowest of thinges necessary, that if we should be stripped of al those things without which we might possibly be, yet these must be left; that destitution in these is such an impedimēt, as till it be remoued, suffereth not the mind of man to admit any other care.Gen. 1.29. Gen. 2.17. For this cause first God assigned Adam maintenance of life and then appointed him a law to obserue. For this cause after mē began to grow to a number,Gen. 4.2. the first thing we reade they gaue thēselues vnto, was the tilling of the earth,Gen. 4.26. and the feeding of cattle. Hauing by this meane whereon to liue, the principall actions of their life afterward are noted by the exercise of their religion.Mat. 6.33 True it is that the kingdome of God must be the first thing in our purposes & desires. But in as much as righteous life presupposeth life, in as much as to liue vertuously it is impossible except we liue; therefore the first impediment, which naturally we endeuor to remoue, is penurie and want of thinges without which we cannot liue. Vnto life many implements are necessary; moe, if we seeke (as

all men naturally doe) such a life as hath in it ioy, comfort, delight and pleasure. To this end we see how quickly sundry artes Mechanical were found out in the very prime of the world.Gen. 4.20.21.

                  2. As things of greatest necessitie are alwaies first prouided for, so things of greatest dignitie are most accounted of by all such as iudge rightly. Although therefore riches be a thing which euery man wisheth; yet no man of iudgement can esteeme it better to be rich, then wise, vertuous & religious. If we be both or either of these, it is not because we are so borne. For into the world we come as emptie of the one as of the other, as naked in minde as we are in body. Both which necessities of man had at the first no other helpes and supplies, then only domesticall; such as that which the prophet implieth, saying, Can a mother forget her child? such as that which the Apostle mentioneth, saying▪
               Esay. 49.15. 1. Tim. 5.8. 
               He that careth not for his owne is worse then an Infidell;Gen. 18.19. such as that concerning Abraham, Abraham will commaund his sonnes and his household after him that they keepe the way of the Lord. But neither that which we learne of our selues, nor that which others teach vs can preuaile, where wickednes and malice haue takē deepe roote. If therefore when there was but as yet one only family in the world, no meanes of instruction humane or diuine could preuent effusion of bloud:Gen. 4.8. how could it be chosen but that when families were multiplied and increased vpon earth, after seperation each prouiding for it selfe, enuy, strife, cōtention & violence must grow amongst thē? for hath not nature furnisht man with wit & valor, as it were with armor, which may be vsed as well vnto extreame euill as good? yea, were they not vsed by the rest of the world vnto euill; vnto the contrary only by Seth,
               Gen. 6.5. Gen. 5. 
               Enoch, and those few the rest in that line? We all make complaint of the iniquitie of our times: not vniustly; for the dayes are euill. But compare them with those times, wherein there were no ciuil societies, with those times wherein there was as yet no maner of publique regimēt established, with those times wherin there were not aboue 8. persons righteous liuing vpon the face of the earth:2. Pet. 2.5. and wee haue surely good cause to thinke that God hath blessed vs exceedingly, and hath made vs behold most happie daies. To take away all such mutuall greeuances, iniuries & wrongs, there was no way but only by growing vnto compositiō and agreement amongst thēselues, by ordaining some kind of gouernment publike, and by yeelding themselues subiect thereunto; that vnto whom they graunted authoritie to rule & gouerne, by them the peace, tranquilitie, & happy estate of the rest might be procured. Men alwaies knew that when force and iniurie was offered, they might be defendors of themselues; they knew that howsoeuer men may seeke their owne cōmoditie, yet if this were done with iniury vnto others, it was not to be suffered, but by all men and by all good means to be withstood, finally they knew that no man might in reason take vpon him to determine his owne right, and according to his owne determination proceed in maintenance therof, in as much as euery man is towards himselfe, and them whom he greatly affecteth partiall; and therfore that strifes & troubles would bee endlesse, except they gaue their common consent all to be ordered by some whom they should agree vpon: without which consent, there were no reason that one man should take vpon him to be Lord or Iudge ouer an other; because although there be according to the opinion of some very great and iudicious men, a kind of naturall right in the noble, wise, and vertuous,Arist. Pol. l▪

                  . & 4. to gouerne them which are of seruile disposition; neuerthelesse for manifestation of this their right, & mens more peaceable

contentment on both sides, the assent of them who are to be gouerned, seemeth necessarie. To fathers within their priuate families nature hath giuen a supreme power; for which cause we see throughout the world euen from the first foundation therof, all men haue euer bene taken as lords & lawfull kings in their own houses. Howbeit ouer a whole grand multitude, hauing no such dependē
               cie vpon any one, & consisting of so many families as euery politique societie in the world doth, impossible it is that any should haue complet lawful power but by consent of men, or immediate appointment of God; because not hauing the naturall superioritie of fathers, their power must needs be either vsurped, & then vnlawfull; or if lawfull, then either graunted or consented vnto by them ouer whom they exercise the same, or else giuen extraordinarily frō God, vnto whom all the world is subiect.Arist. polit. lib. 1. cap. 3. Vide & platonem in 3. de legibus. It is no improbable opinion therefore which the Archphilosopher was of, that as the chiefest person in euery houshold was alwaies as it were a king; so when numbers of housholds ioyned themselues in ciuill societie together, kings were the first kind of gouernors amongst them. Which is also as it seemeth the reason, why the name of Father continued still in them, who of fathers were made rulers: as also the ancient custome of gouernors to do as Melchisedec, and being kings to exercise the office of priests, which fathers did at the first, grew perhaps by the same occasion. Howbeit not this the only kind of regiment that hath bene receiued in the world. The inconueniences of one kinde haue caused sundry other to be deuised. So that in a word all publike regimēt of what kind soeuer, seemeth euidently to haue risen from deliberate aduice, consultation, & compositiō betweene men, iudging it cōuenient & behoueful; there being no impossibilitie in nature considered by it self, but that men might haue liued without any publike regiment. Howbeit the corruption of our nature being presupposed, we may not deny but that the lawe of nature doth now require of necessitie some kinde of regiment; so that to bring things vnto the first course they were in, & vtterly to take away all kind of publike gouernmēt in the world, were apparantly to ouerturn the whole world. The case of mans nature standing therfore as it doth, some kind of regiment the law of nature doth require; yet the kinds therof being many, nature tieth not to any one, but leaueth the choice as a thing arbitrarie. At the first when some certaine kinde of regiment was once approued, it may be that nothing was then further thought vpon for the maner of gouerning, but all permitted vnto their wisedome and discretion which were to rule; Cum premeretur initio multitudo ab lis qui maiores opes habebāt, ad vnum aliquem confugiebant virtute praestantem; qui cum prohiberet iniuriâ tenuiores, aequitate constituendâ summos cum infimis pari iu re retinebat. Cum id minus contingeret, leges sunt inuentae. Cic. off. lib. 2.

                   Arist. Rhet. ad Alex. till by experience they found this for all parts very inconuenient; so as the thing which they had deuised for a remedie, did indeede but increase the soare which it should haue cured. They saw that to liue by one mans will, became the cause of all mens misery. This constrained them to come vnto lawes, wherein all men might see their duties before hand, and know the penalties of transgressing them. b If things be simply good or euill, and withall vniuersally so acknowledged, there needs no new law to be made for such things. The first kind therefore of things appointed by lawes humane, containeth whatsoeuer being in it selfe naturally good or euill, is notwithstanding more secret then that it can be discerned by euery mans present conceipt, without some deeper discourse and iudgement. In which discourse, because there is difficultie and possibilitie many waies to erre, vnlesse such things were set downe by lawes, many would be ignorant of their duties which now are not; & many that know what they should do, would

neuerthelesse dissemble it, and to excuse themselues pretend ignorance and simplicitie which now they cannot.Tanta est enim vis voluptatum, vt & ignorantiam pro telet in occasionem, & conscientiam corrumpat in dissimulationem. Tertul. lib. de Spectacul. And because the greatest part of men are such as prefer their owne priuate good before all things, euen that good which is sensuall before whatsoeuer is most diuine; & for that the labor of doing good, together with the pleasure arising from the cōtrary, doth make men for the most part slower to the one, & proner to the other, then that dutie prescribed them by law can preuaile sufficiently with them: therefore vnto lawes that men do make for the benefit of mē, it hath seemed alwaies needful to ad rewards which may more allure vnto good then any hardnes deterreth from it, & punishments which may more deterre from euil then any sweetnes therto allureth. Wherin as the generalitie is naturall, Vertue rewardable and vice punishable: so the particular determination of the rewarde or punishment, belongeth vnto them by whom lawes are made. Theft is naturally punishable, but the kinde of punishment is positiue, and such lawfull as men shall thinke with discretion conuenient by lawe to appoint. In lawes that which is naturall bindeth vniuersally, that which is positiue not so. To let goe those kind of positiue lawes which men impose vpon thē
               selues, as by vow vnto God, contract with men, or such like; somewhat it will make vnto our purpose a little more fully to cōsider, what things are incident into the making of the positiue lawes for the gouernment of thē that liue vnited in publique societie. Lawes do not onely teach what is good, but they inioyne it, they haue in thē a certain cōstraining force. And to cōstraine mē vnto any thing inconuenient doth seeme vnreasonable. Most requisite therefore it is, that to deuise lawes which all men shal be forced to obey, none but wise mē be admitted. Lawes are matters of principall consequence; men of cōmon capacitie & but ordinary iudgemēt are not able (for how should they?) to discerne what things are fittest for each kind and state of regiment. Wee cannot be ignorant how much our obedience vnto lawes dependeth vpon this point. Let a man though neuer so iustly, oppose himselfe vnto thē that are disordered in their waies, & what one amongst them commonly doth not stomacke at such contradiction, storme at reproofe, and hate such as would reforme them? Notwithstanding euen they which brooke it worst that men should tell them of their duties, when they are told the same by a lawe, thinke very wel & reasonably of it. For why? They presume that the lawe doth speake with all indifferencie, that the lawe hath no side respect to their persons, that the law is as it were an oracle proceeded from wisedome and vnderstanding. Howbeit laws do not take their constraining force frō the qualitie of such as deuise them, but from that power which doth giue them the strength of lawes. That which we spake before concerning the power of gouernment, must here be applyed vnto the power of making lawes wherby to gouerne; which power God hath ouer all; and by the naturall lawe whereunto hee hath made all subiect, the lawfull power of making lawes to commaund whole politique societies of men, belongeth so properly vnto the same intire societies, that for any Prince or potentate of what kinde soeuer vpon earth to exercise the same of himselfe, and not either by expresse commission immediatly and personally receiued from God, or else by authoritie deriued at the first frō their consent vpon whose persons they impose lawes, it is no better then meere tyrannie. Lawes they are not therefore which publique approbation hath not made so. But approbation not only they giue who personally declare their assent by voice

sign or act, but also whē others do it in their names by right originally at the least deriued from them. As in parliaments, councels, & the like assemblies, although we be not personally our selues present, notwithstanding our assent is by reasō of others agents there in our behalfe. And what we do by others, no reason but that it should stand as our deede, no lesse effectually to binde vs then if our selues had done it in person. In many things assent is giuen, they that giue it not imagining they do so, because the manner of their assenting is not apparent. As for example, when an absolute Monark commandeth his subiects that which seemeth good in his owne discretion, hath not his edict the force of a law, whether they approue or dislike it? Againe that which hath bene receiued long sithence and is by custome now established, we keep as a law which we may not transgresse; yet what consent was euer thereunto sought or required at our hands? Of this point therefore we are to note, that sith men naturally haue no ful & perfect power to commaund whole politique mul
                  •
               itudes of men; therefore vtterly without our consent we could in such sort be at no mans commandement liuing. And to be commanded we do consent, when that societie wherof we are part, hath at any time before consented, without reuoking the same after by the like vniuersall agreement. Wherfore as any mans deed past is good as long as himself continueth: so the act of a publique societie of men done fiue hundred yeares sithence, standeth as theirs, who presently are of the same societies, because corporations are immortall: we were then aliue in our predecessors, and they in their successors do liue stil. Lawes therefore humaine of what kinde soeuer are auaileable by consent. If here it be demaunded how it commeth to passe, that this being common vnto all lawes which are made, there should be found euen in good lawes so great varietie as there is: wee must note the reason hereof to bee, the sundry particular endes, whereunto the different disposition of that subiect or matter for which lawes are prouided, causeth them to haue especiall respect in making lawes.Arist. polit. lib.

                  t. A lawe there is mentioned amongst the Graecians, whereof Pittacus is reported to haue bene author: And by that lawe it was agreed, that hee which being ouercome with drinke did then strike any man, should suffer punishment double as much as if hee had done the same being sober. No man coulde euer haue thought this reasonable, that had intended thereby onely to punish the iniury committed, according to the grauitie of the fact. For who knoweth not, that harme aduisedly done is naturally lesse pardonable, and therefore worthy of the sharper punishment? But for as much as none did so vsually this way offende as men in that case, which they wittingly fell into, euen because they would bee so much the more freely outragious: it was for their publique good where such disorder was growne, to frame a positiue lawe for remedie thereof accordingly. To this appertaine those knowne lawes of making lawes; as that lawemakers must haue an eye to the place where, and to the men amongst whome; that one kinde of lawes cannot serue for all kindes of regiment: that where the multitude beareth sway, lawes that shall tend vnto the preseruation of that state, must make common smaller offices to go by lot, for feare of strife and deuision likely to arise; by reason that ordinary qualities sufficing for discharge of such offices, they could not but by many bee desired, and so with daunger contended for, and not missed without grudge and discontentment,

whereas at an vncertaine lot none can find themselues grieued on whomsoeuer it lighteth; contrariwise the greatest; whereof but few are capable, to passe by popular election, that neither the people may enuie such as haue those honours, in as much as themselues bestow them, and that the chiefest may bee kindled with desire to exercise all partes of rare and beneficiall vertue; knowing they shal not loose their labour by growing in same and estimation amongst the people: if the helme of chiefe gouernment bee in the handes of a few of the wealthiest, that then lawes prouiding for continuance thereof must make the punishment of contumelie and wrong offered vnto any of the common sorte sharpe and grieuous, that so the euill may be preuented, whereby the rich are most likely to bring themselues into hatred with the people, who are not wonte to take so great offence when they are excluded from honors and offices, as whē their persons are contumeliously troden vpon. In other kindes of regiment the like is obserued concerning the difference of positiue lawes, which to be euerie where the same is impossible and against their nature.Staundf. pref, to the pleas of the Crowne. Now as the learned in the lawes of this land obserue, that our statutes sometimes are onely the affirmation or ratification of that which by common law was held before: so heere it is not to be omitted, that generally all lawes humaine which are made for the ordering of politike societies, bee either such as establish some dutie whereunto all men by the law of reason did before stand bound; or else such as make that a dutie now which before was none. The one sort wee may for distinctions sake call mixedly, and the other meerely humane. That which plaine or necessary reason bindeth men vnto, may be in sundrie considerations expedient to be ratified by humane law: For example, if confusion of blood in marriage, the libertie of hauing many wiues at once, or any other the like corrupt and vnreasonable custome doth happen to haue preuailed far, and to haue gotten the vpper hand of right reason with the greatest part, so that no way is left to rectifie such soule disorder, without prescribing by law the same thinges which reason necessarilie doth enforce, but is not perceiued that so it doth; or if many be grown vnto that which thapostle did lament in some, concerning whom he writeth saying,Epis. Iud. v. 10

Ethi. lib. 10 cap. 10. that Euen what things they naturally know, in those very things as beasts void of reason they corrupted themselues; or if there be no such speciall accident, yet for as much as the common sort are led by the sway of their sensuall desires, and therefore doe more shun sinne for the sensible euils which follow it amongst men, then for any kinde of sentence which reason doth pronounce against it▪ this very thing is cause sufficient why duties belonging vnto each kinde of vertue, albeit the law of reason teach them, should notwithstanding be prescribed euen by humane law. Which law in this case we terme mixt, because the mat
                  •
               er whereunto it bindeth, is the same which reason necessarily doth require at our handes, and from the law of reason it differeth in the maner of binding onely. For whereas men before stoode bound in conscience to doe as the law of reason teacheth, they are now by vertue of humane law become constrainable, and if they outwardly transgresse, punishable. As for lawes which are meerely humane, the matter of them is any thing which reason doth but probably 
                  •
               each to bee fit and conuenient; so that till such time as law hath passed amongst men about it, of it selfe it bindeth no man. One example whereof may be this. Landes are by humane

law in some places after the owners decease diuided vnto all his children▪ in some all descendeth to the eldest sonne. If the lawe of reason did necessarily require but the one of these two to be done, they which by lawe haue receiued the other, should be subiect to that heauy sentence, which denounceth against all that decree wicked vniust, & vnreasonable things, woe. Whereas now which soeuer be receiued,Esa. 10.1. there is no law of reason transgrest; because there is probable reason why eyther of them may be expedient, and for eyther of them more then probable reason there is not to bee found. Lawes whether mixtly or meerely humane are made by politique societies: some, onely as those societies are ciuilly vnited; some, as they are spiritually ioyned and make such a body as wee call the Church. Of lawes humane in this later kinde wee are to speake in the third booke following. Let it therefore suffice thus far to haue touched the force wherewith almightie God hath gratiously endued our nature, and thereby inabled the same to finde out both those lawes which all men generally are for euer bound to obserue, and also such as are most fit for their behoofe who leade their liues in any ordered state of gouernment. Now besides that lawe which simply concerneth men as men, and that which belongeth vnto them as they are men linked with others in some forme of politique societie; there is a third kinde of lawe which toucheth all such seuerall bodies politique, so farre forth as one of them hath publique commerce with another. And this third is the Lawe of nations. Betweene men and beastes there is no possibilitie of sociable communion; because the w
                  •
               lspring of that communion is a naturall delight which man hath to transfuse from himselfe into others, and to receiue from others into himselfe, especially those things wherein the excellencie of his kinde doth most consist. The chiefest instrument of humane communion therefore is speech, because thereby we impart mutually one to another the conceiptes of our reasonable vnderstanding.Arist. pol. 1. c. And for that cause seeing beasts are not hereof capable, for as much as with them wee can vse no such conference, they being in degree although aboue other creatures on earth to whom nature hath denied sense, yet lower then to be sociable companions of man to whome nature hath giuen reason;Gen. 2.20. it is of Adam said that amongst the beastes Hee found not for himselfe any meete companion. Ciuill societie doth more content the nature of man, then any priuate kinde of solitary liuing; because in societie this good of mutuall participation is so much larger then otherwise. Herewith notwithstanding wee are not satisfied, but we couet (if it might be) to haue a kinde of societie & fellowship euen withal mākind. Which thing Socrates intending to signifie, professed himselfe a Citizen,Cic. Tusc. 5. & 1. de legib. not of this or that cōmon-welth, but of the world. And an effect of that very natural desire in vs, (a manifest
                  •
               token that we wish after a sort an vniuersall fellowship with all men) appeareth by the wonderfull delight men haue, some to visit forrein countries, some to discouer natiōs not heard of in former ages, we all to know the affaires & dealings of other people, yea to be in league of amitie with them:1. Reg. 10.1. & this not onely for traffiques sake, or to the end that when many are cōfederated each may make other the more strong;2. Chr. 9.1. but for such cause also as moued the Queene of Saba to visit Salomon;Math. 13.42. Luk. 11.31. & in a word because nature doth presume that how many mē there are in the world, so many Gods as it were ther are, or at least wise such they should be towardes men. Touching lawes which are to

serue men in this behalfe; euen as those lawes of reason, which (man retaining his original integritie) had bin sufficient to direct each particular person in all his affaires & duties, are not sufficient but require the accesse of other lawes, now that man and his offspring are growne thus corrupt & sinfull; againe as those lawes of politie & regiment, which would haue serued men liuing in publique societie together with that harmlesse disposition which then they should haue had▪ are not able now to serue when mens iniquitie is so hardly restrained within any tolerable bounds in like maner the nationall lawes of mutuall commerce be

               weene societies of that former and better qualitie might haue bene other then now, when nations are so prone to offer violence, iniurie and wrong. Here upon hath growne in euery of these three kinds, that distinction between Primarie & Secundarie lawes; the one grounded vpon sincere, the other built vpon depraued nature. Primarie lawes of nations are such as concerne embassage, such as belong to the courteous entertainment of forreiners and strangers, such as serue for commodious traffique and the like. Secundary lawes in the same kinde, are such as this present vnquiet world is most familiarly acquainted with, I meane lawes of armes▪ which yet are much better known then kept. But what matter the law of nations doth containe I omit to search. The strength and vertue of that law is such, that no particular natiō can lawfully preiudic
                  •
                the same by any their seueral laws & ordinances, more then a man by his priuate resolutions the law of the whole cōmon-welth or state wherin he liueth. For as ciuill law being the act of a whole body politique, doth therfore ouerrule each seuerall part of the same body: so there is no reason that any one commō-welth of it self, should to the preiudice of another annihilate that whereupon the whole world hath agreed. For which cause the Lacedemonians forbidding all accesse of strangers into their coasts,Iose. lib. 2. contra Applou. Theod. lib. 9. de Sanand

Now as there is great cause of cōmuniō, & consequently of laws for the maintenance of cōmunion, amongst nations: So amongst nations Christian the like in regard euen of Christianitie hath bene a

               waies iudged needfull. And in this kinde of correspondence amongst natiōs, the force of general councels doth stand: For as one & the same law diuine, wherof in the next place we are to speak, is vnto al Christiā churches a rule for the chiefest things, by meanes whereof they al in that respect make one Church, as hauing all but One Lord, one faith, and one baptisme:

So the vrgent necessitie of mutual communion for preseruation of our vnitie in these things, as also for order in some other things cōuenient to be euery where vniformly kept, maketh it requisit that the church of God here on earth haue her lawes of spirituall commerce betweene Christian nations, lawes by vertue wherof all Churches may enioy freely the vse of those reuerend religious and sacred consultations which are termed councels generall.

To speake of this matter as the cause requireth, would require very long discourse. All I will presently say is this. Whether it be for the finding out of any thing whereunto diuine lawe bindeth vs, but yet in such sort, that men are not thereof on all sides resolued; or for the setting downe of some vniforme iudgement to stand touching such thinges, as being neither way matters of necessitie, are notwithstanding offensiue and scandalous when there is open opposition about them; be it for the ending of strifes touching matters of Christian beliefe, wherein the one part may seeme to haue probable cause of dissenting from the other; or be it concerning matters of politie, order, and regiment in the Church;Ioh. 14.27
                     •
                  
                I nothing doubt but that Christiā men should much better frame themselues to those heauenly precepts, which our Lord and Sauiour with so great instancie gaue as concerning peace and vnitie, if we did all concurre in desire to haue the vse of auncient councels againe renued, rather then these proceedings continued, which eyther make all contentions endlesse, or bring them to one onely determination, and that of all other the worst, which is by sword. It followeth therefore that a new foundation being laid, wee now adioyne hereunto that which commeth in the next place to be spoken of, namely, wherefore God hath himselfe by scripture made knowne such lawes as serue for direction of men.
            
               Wherfore God hath by scripture further made knowne such supernaturall lawes as do serue for mens direction.11 Al things (God only excepted) besides the nature which they haue in thē
               selues, receiue externally some perfection frō other things, as hath bene shewed. In so much as there is in the whole world no one thing great or small, but either in respect of knowledge or of vse it may vnto out perfectiō adde somewhat. And whatsoeuer such perfection there is which our nature may acquire, the same we properly terme our good; our soueraign good or blessednes, that wherin the highest degree of all our perfectiō consisteth, that which being once attained vnto, there cā rest nothing further to be desired, & therfore with it our soules are fully cōtent & satisfied, in that they haue they reioyce & thirst for no more▪ wherfore of goo

                things desired, some are such that for themselues we couet them not, but only because they serue as instruments vnto that for which we are to seeke, of this sorte are riches: an other kind there is which although we desire for it selfe, as health & vertue & knowledge, neuerthelesse they are not the last marke whereat we aime, but haue their further end whereunto they are referred; so as in them we are not satisfied as hauing attained the vtmost we may, but our desires doe still proceede. These things are linked and as it were chained one to another, we labour to eate, and we eate to liue, and we liue to do good, & the good which we do is as seede sowne Gal. 6.8. Hee that soweth to the spirit, shall of the spirit reape life euerlasting. with reference vnto a future haruest. But we must come at the length to some pause. For if euery thing were to bee desired for some other without any stint, there could be no certaine end proposed vnto our actions, we should go on we know not whether, yea whatsoeuer we do were in vaine, or rather nothing at all were possible to be done. For as to take away the first efficient of our being, were 
                  •
               o annihilate vtterly our persons; so we cannot remoue the last finall cause of our working, but we shall cause whatsoeuer we worke to cease. Therfore some

thing there must be desired for it selfe simply and for no other. That is simply for it selfe desirable, vnto the nature wherof it is opposite & repugnant to be desired with relation vnto any other. The oxe and the asse desire their food, neither propose they vnto themselues any end wherfore; so that of them this is desired for it selfe; but why? By reason of their imperfection which cannot otherwise desire it: whereas that which is desired simply for it selfe, the excellencie thereof is such as permitteth it not in any sort to be referred to a further end. Now that which man doth desire with reference to a further end, the same he desireth in such measure as is vnto that end conuenient: but what he coueteth as good in it selfe, towardes that his desire is euer infinite. So that vnlesse the last good of all which is desired altogether for it selfe, be also infinite; we doe euill in making it our end: euen as they who placed their felicitie in wealth or honour or pleasure or any thing here attained; because in desiring any thing as our finall perfection which is not so, we do amisse. Nothing may be infinitly desired, but that good which in deed is infinite. For the better, the more desirable; that therefore most desirable,Vide Arist Eth 10. cap. 10. & Metaph. 12. ca 6. & cap. 4. & cap. 30. wherin there is infinitie of goodnes; so that if any thing desirable may be infinit, that must needes be the highest of all things that are desired. No good is infinite but onely God: therefore he our felicitie and blisse. Moreouer desire tendeth vnto vnion with that it desireth. If then in him we be blessed, it is by force of participation & coniunction with him. Againe, it is not the possession of any good thing can make them happie which haue it, vnlesse they inioy the thing wherewith they are possessed. Then are we happie therfore, when fully we enioy God, as an obiect wherein the powers of our soules are satisfied euen with euerlasting delight: so that although we be mē, yet by being vnto God vnited, we liue as it were the life of God. Happines therfore is that estate wherby we attaine, so far as possibly may be attained, the ful possession of that which simply for it selfe is to be desired, and containeth in it after an eminent sorte the contentation of our desires, the highest degree of all our perfection. Of such perfection capable we are not in this life. For while we are in the world, subiect we are vnto sundry

Complete vnion with him must be according vnto euery power and facultie of our mindes apt to receiue so glorious an obiect. Capable we are of God both by vnderstanding and will; by vnderstanding as hee is that soueraigne truth, which comprehendeth the rich treasures of all wisdom▪ by will, as he is that sea of goodnesse, whereof who so tasteth shall thirst no more. As the wil doth now worke vpon that obiect by desire, which is as it were a motion towards the end as yet vnobtained; so likewise vpon the same hereafter receiued it shall worke also by loue. Appetitus inhiantis fit amor fruentis, saith Saint Augustine, The longing disposition of them that thirst, is chaunged▪ into the sweete affection of them that taste and are replenished. Whereas wee now loue the thing that is good, but good especially in respect of benefit vnto vs▪ we shall then loue the thing that is good, only or principally for the goodnes of beauty in it self. The soule being in this sorte as it is actiue, perfected by loue of that infinite good; shall as it is receptiue,

be also perfected with those supernaturall passions of ioy peace & delight. All this endlesse and euerlasting.Math. 25. The iust shall goe into life euerlasting▪

Therefore this desire in man is naturall. It is not in our power not to do the same: how should it then be in our power to doe it coldly or remissely? so that our desire being naturall, is also in that degree of earnestnes whereunto nothing can be added. And is it probable that God should frame the hearts of all mē so desirous of that which no man may obtaine? It is an axiome of nature, that naturall desire cannot vtterly be frustrate.Comment in proaem. 2. Me

                  ph. This desire of ours being natural should be frustrate, if that which may satisfie the same were a thing impossible for man to aspire vnto. Man doth seeke a triple perfection, first a sensual, consisting in those things which very life it selfe requireth, either as necessary supplements, or as beauties & ornaments therof; then an intellectuall, consisting in those things which none vnderneth man is either capable of or acquainted with; lastly a spirituall & diuine, consisting in those things wherunto we tend by supernatural means here, but cānot here attaine vnto them. They that make the first of these three the scope of their whole life, are said by the Apostle to haue no God, but onely their bellie, to be earthly minded men. Vnto the second they bend themselues, who seeke especially to excell in all such knowledge & vertue as doth most cōmend men. To this branch belongeth the lawe of morall & ciuil perfection.Phil. 3.1

                  . That there is somewhat higher then either of these two, no other proofe doth neede, then the very processe of mans desire, which being naturall should be frustrate, if there were not some farther thing wherin it might rest at the length contented, which in the former it cannot do. For man doth not seeme to rest satisfied either with fruition of that wherewith his life is preserued, or with performance of such actions as aduance him most deseruedly in estimation; but doth further couet, yea oftentimes manifestly pursue with great sedulitie & earnestnes, that which cannot stand him in any stead for vitall vse; that which exceedeth the reach of sense; yea somwhat aboue capacitie of reason, somewhat diuine and heauenly, which with hidden exultation it rather surmiseth then conceiueth; somwhat it seeketh and what▪ that is directly it knoweth not, yet very intentiue desire thereof doth so incite it, that all other knowne delightes and pleasures are laide aside, they giue place to the search of this but onely suspected desire. If the soule of man did serue onely to giue him beeing in this life, then thinges appertaining vnto this life would content him, as wee see they doe other creatures: which creatures

inioying what they liue by, seeke no further, but in this contentation do shew a kind of acknowledgemēt, that there is no higher good which doth any way belōg vnto thē. With vs it is otherwise. For although the beauties, riches, honors, sciences, virtues and perfections of all men liuing, were in the present possession of one: yet somewhat beyond and aboue all this there would still be sought and earnestly thirsted for. So that nature euen in this life doth plainly claime & call for a more diuine prefectiō, then either of these two that haue bene mentioned. This last and highest estate of perfection whereof we speake, is receiued of men in the nature of a Math.

Our naturall meanes therefore vnto blessednesse are our workes: nor is it possible that nature should euer find any other way to saluation then onely this. But examine the workes which we do, and since the first foundation of the world what one can say, My wayes are pure? Seeing then all flesh is guilty of that for which God hath threatned eternally to punish, what possibility is there this way to be saued? There resteth therefore either no way vnto saluation, or if any, then surely a way which is supernaturall, a way which could neuer haue entred into the heart of man as much as once to conceiue or imagine, if God himself had not reuealed it extraordinarily. For which cause we terme it the mystery or secret way of saluation. And therfore S. Ambrose in this matter appealeth iustly from man to God, Ambros. contra Sym.

                  am consequendae immortalitatis ostenderet. Lactan. lib. 1. cap. 1. 
               When men of excellent wit (saith Lactantius) had wholly betaken thēselues vnto study, after farewell bidden vnto all kind as well of priuate as publique action, they spared no labour that might be spent in the search of truth; holding it a thing of much more price to seeke and to find out the reason of all affaires as well diuine as humaine, thē to stick fast in the toile of piling vp riches and gathering together heapes of honors. Howbeit they bothe did faile of their purpose, and got not as much as to quite their charges; because truth which is the secret of the most high God, whose proper handiworke all things are, cannot be compassed with that wit and those senses which are our owne. For God and man should be very neere neighbors, if mans cogitations were able to take a suracy of the counsels and appointments of that maiestie euerlasting. Which being vtterly impossible, that the eye of man by it selfe should looke into the bosome of diuine reason; God did not suffer him being desirous of the light of wisedome, to stray any longer vp & downe, and with bootlesse expense of trauaile to wander in darknesse that had no passage to get out by. His eyes at the length God did open; and bestow vpon him the knowledge of the truth by way of Donatiue; to the end that man might both be clearly conuicted of folly, and being through error out of the way, haue the path that leadeth vnto immortality layd plaine before him. Thus far Lactantius Firmianus to shew that God himselfe is the teacher of the truth, wherby is made knowne the supernaturall way of saluation & law for thē to liue in that shall be saued. In the natural path of euerlasting life, the first beginning is that hability of doing good, which God in the day of mans creation indued him with; frō hence obedience vnto the will of his creator, absolute righteousnes and integrity in all his actions; and last of al the iustice of God rewarding the worthinesse of his deserts with the crowne of eternall glory. Had Adam continued in his first estate, this had bene

                  titiam sit reddenda perfectio perennis tanquam praemium, imo abundans fieret retributio in beatitudine vnius momenti. wittiest of the Schoole diuines, that if we speake of strict iustice, God could no way haue bene bound to require mans labours in so large and ample maner as humaine felicitie doth import: in as much as the dignity of this exceedeth so far the others value. But be it that God of his great liberality had determined in lieu of mans endeuors to bestow the same, by the rule of that iustice which best beseemeth him, namely the iustice of one that requiteth nothing mincingly, but all with pressed and heaped and euen ouer-inlarged measure: yet could it neuer hereupon necessarily bee gathered, that such iustice should adde to the nature of that reward the property of euerlasting continuance; sith possession of blisse, though it should be but for a moment, were an aboundant retribution. But we are not now to enter into this consideration, how gratious and bountifull our good God might still appeare in so rewarding the sonnes of men, albeit they should exactly performe▪ whatsoeuer duty their nature bindeth thē vnto. Howsoeuer God did propose this reward, we that were to be rewarded must haue done that which is required at our hands; we failing in the one, it were in nature an impossibility that the other should be looked for. The light of nature is neuer able to find out any way of obtaining the reward of blisse, but by performing exactly the duties and works of righteousnes. From saluation therefore and life all flesh being excluded this way, behold how the wisedome of God hath reuealed a way mysticall and supernaturall, a way directing vnto the same end of life by a course which groundeth it selfe vpon the guiltinesse of sinne, and through sinne desert of condemnation and death. For in this way the first thing is the tender compassion of God respecting vs drowned and swallowed vp in miserie; the next is redemption out of the same by the pretious death and merite of a mighty Sauiour, which hath witnessed of himselfe saying Iohn. 14.6. 
               I am the way, the way that leadeth vs from miserie into blisse. This supernaturall way had God in himselfe prepared before all worlds. The way of supernaturall dutie which to vs he hath prescribed, our Sauiour in the Gospell of Saint Iohn doth note, terming it by an excellency the worke of God: Iohn 6.29. 
               This is the worke of God that ye beleeue in him whom he hath sent. Not that God doth require nothing vnto happinesse at the hands of men sauing onely a naked beliefe, (for hope and Charity we may not exclude:) but that without beliefe all other things are as nothing, & it the ground of those other diuine vertues. Concerning faith, the principall obiect whereof is that eternall veritie which hath discouered the treasures of hidden wisedome in Christ; concerning hope, the highest obiect wherof is that euerlasting goodnesse which in Christ doth quicken the dead; concerning charity, the finall obiect whereof is that incomprehensible beauty which shineth in the countenance of Christ the sonne of the liuing God; concerning these vertues, the first of which beginning here with a weake apprehensiō of things not seene, endeth with the intuitiue vision of God in the world to come; the second beginning here with a trembling expectation of things far remoued, and as yet but onely heard of, endeth with reall and actuall fruition of that which no tongue can expresse; the third beginning here with a weake inclination of heart towards him vnto whom we are not able to approch, endeth with endlesse vnion, the mistery wherof is higher then the reach of the thoughts of men; concerning that faith hope & charity without which

there can be no saluation; was there euer any mention made sauing only in that law which God himselfe hath from heauen reuealed? There is not in the world a syllable muttered with certaine truth cōcerning any of these three, more then hath bene supernaturally receiued from the mouth of the eternall God. Lawes therefore concerning these things are supernaturall, both in respect of the maner of deliuering them which is diuine, and also in regard of the things deliuered, which are such as haue not in nature any cause from which they flow, but were by the voluntary appointment of God ordeined besides the course of nature, to rectifie natures obliquity withall.
            12 The cause why so many naturall or rational laws are 
                     •
                  et downe in hol▪ Scripture. When supernaturall duties are necessarily exacted, naturall are not reiected as needlesse. The law of God therefore is though principally deliuered for instruction in the one, yet fraught with precepts of the other also. The scripture is fraught euen with lawes of nature. In so much that, Ius naturale est quod in lege & Euāgelio continetur. p. 1. d. 1. Gratian defining naturall right (whereby is meant the right which exacteth those generall duties, that concerne men naturally euen as they are men) termeth naturall right that which the bookes of the Lawe and the Gospell do containe. Neither is it vaine that the Scripture aboundeth with so great store of lawes in this kind. For they are either such as we of our selues could not easily haue found out, and then the benefit is not small to haue them readily set downe to our hands▪ or if they be so cleere & manifest that no man indued with reason can lightly be ignorant of them, yet the spirite as it were borrowing them from the schoole of nature as seruing to proue things lesse manifest, and to induce a perswasion of somewhat which were in it selfe more hard and darke, vnlesse it should in such sort be cleared, the very applying of them vnto cases particular is not without most singular vse and profite many wayes for mens instruction. Besides, be they plaine of themselues or obscure, the euidence of Gods owne testimonie added vnto the naturall assent of reason concerning the certaintie of them, doth not a little comfort and confirme the same. Wherefore in as much as our actions are conuersant about things beset with many circumstances, which cause men of sundry wits to be also of sundry iudgements concerning that which ought to be done: requisite it cānot but seeme the rule of diuine law should herein helpe our imbecillity, that we might the more infallibly vnderstand what is good & what euill. The first principles of the law of nature are easie, hard it were to find men ignorant of them: but concerning the duty which natures law doth require at the hands of men in a number of things particular, so Iosephus lib. secūdo contra Appio.

Hereby we know euen secret concupiscence to be sinne, and are made fearefull to offend though it be but in a wandering cogitation. Finally of those things

which are for direction of all the parts of our life needfull, and not impossible to be discerned by the light of nature it selfe, are there not many which few mens naturall capacitie, and some which no mans hath bene able to find out? They are, sayth Saint Augustine, but a few and they indued with great ripenes of wit and iudgement, free from all such affaires as might trouble their meditations, instructed in the sharpest and the subtlest points of learning, who haue, and that very hardly, bene able to find out but onely the immortality of the soule. The resurrection of the flesh what man did euer at any time dreame of, hauing not heard it otherwise then from the schoole of nature? Whereby it appeareth how much we are bound to yeeld vnto our creator the father of all mercy eternall thankes, for that he hath deliuered his law vnto the world, a law wherein so many things are laid open cleere and manifest; as a light which otherwise would haue bene buried in darknesse, not without the hazard, or rather not with the hazard, but with the certaine losse of infinite thousands of soules most vndoubtedly now saued. We see therefore that our soueraigne good is desired naturally; that God the author of that naturall desire had appointed naturall meanes whereby to fulfill it; that man hauing vtterly disabled his nature vnto those meanes, hath had other reuealed from God, and hath receaued from heauen a law to teach him how that which is desired naturally must now supernaturally be attained, finally we see that because those later exclude not the former quite and cleane as vnnecessary, therefore together with such supernaturall duties as could not possibly haue beene otherwise knowne to the world, the same lawe that teacheth them, teacheth also with them such naturall duties as could not by light of nature easily haue bene knowne.
            
               The benefit of hauing diuine lawes written.13. In the first age of the world God gaue lawes vnto our fathers, and by reason of the number of their daies, their memories serued in steed of books; wherof the manifold imperfections and defects being knowne to God, he mercifully relieued the same by often putting them in mind of that whereof it behoued them to be specially mindfull. In which respect we see how many times one thing hath bene iterated vnto sundry euen of the best and wisest amongst them▪ After that the liues of men were shortned, meanes more durable to preserue the lawes of God from obliuion and corruption grew in vse, not without precise direction from God himselfe. First therefore of Moyses it is sayd, that he wrote all the words of God;Exod. 24.4. not by his owne priuate motion and deuise: for God taketh this act to himselfe,Ose. 8.1

               hoc scribendū illis tanquā suis manibus imperauit. Now although we do not deny it to be a matter meerely accidentall vnto the law of God to be written; although writing be not that which addeth authority and strength thereunto, finally though his lawes do require at our hands the same obedience howsoeuer they be deliuered; his prouidēce notwithstanding which hath made principall choice of this way to deliuer them, who seeth not what cause we haue to admire and magnifie? The singular benefit that hath growne vnto the world by receiuing the lawes of God, euen by his owne appointment

committed vnto writing, we are not able to esteeme as the value thereof deserueth▪ When the question therefore is, whether we be now to seeke for any reuealed law of God other where then onely in the sacred Scripture, whether we do now stand bound in the sight of God to yeeld to traditions-vrged by the Church of Rome the same obedience and reuerence we do to his written lawe, honouring equally and adoring both as Diuine: our answer is, no. They that so earnestly pleade for the authority of Tradition, as if nothing were more safely conueyed then that which spreadeth it selfe by report, and descendeth by relation of former generations vnto the ages that succeed, are not all of the them (surely a miracle it were if they should be) so simple, as thus to perswade themselues; howsoeuer if the simple were so perswaded, they could be content perhaps very well to enioy the benefit, as they accompt it, of that common error. What hazard the truth is in when it passeth through the hands of report, how maymed and deformed it becommeth; they are not, they cannot possibly be ignorant. Let them that are indeed of this mind, consider but onely that litle of things Diuine, which the Heathen haue in such sort receiued.I mean those historical matters cōcerning the anciēt state of the first world, the deluge, the sons of Noah, the children of Israels deliuerance out of Aegypt, the life and doings of Moses their Captaine, with such like: the certaine truth whereof deliuered in holy Scripture, is of the Heathen which had thē onely by report, so intermingled with fabulous vanities, that the most which remaineth in them to bee seene, is the shew of darké and obscure steps, where some part of the truth hath gone. How miserable had the state of the Church of God beene long ere this, if wanting the sacred Scripture▪ we had no record of his lawes but onely the memory of man, receiuing the same by report and relation from his predecessors? By Scripture it hath in the wisedome of God seemed meete to deliuer vnto the world much but personally expedient to be practised of certaine men; many deepe and profound points of doctrine, as being the maine originall ground whereupon the precepts of duty depend▪ many prophecies the cleere performance whereof might confirme the world in beliefe of things vnseene; many histories to serue as looking glasses to behold the mercy, the truth, the righteousnesse of God towards all that faithfully serue▪ obey and honor him; yea many intire meditations of pietie, to be as patternes and presidents in cases of like nature; many things needfull for

Be it them that together with the principall necessary lawes of God, there are sundry other things written, whereof we might happily be ignorant, and yet be saued. VVhat shall we hereupon thinke them needlesse? shall we esteeme them as riotous branches wherewith we sometimes behold most pleasant vines ouergrown?

If we define that necessary vnto saluation, whereby the way to saluation is in any sort made more plaine, apparent, and easie to be knowne; then is there no part of true Philosophie, no art of account, no kind of science rightly so called, but the Scripture must conteine it. If onely those things be necessary, as surely none else are, without the knowledge and practise whereof it is not the will and pleasure of God to make any ordinary graunt of saluation; it may be notwithstanding,This question proposed by Scotus, i
                     •
                   affirmatiuely concluded. and oftentimes hath bene demanded, how the bookes of holy Scripture conteine in them all necessary things, when of things necessary the very chiefest is to knowe what bookes we are bound to esteeme holy; which point is confest impossible for the Scripture it selfe to teach. Whereunto wee may aunswere with truth, that there is not in the world any Arte or Science, which proposing vnto it selfe an ende (as euery one doth some ende or other) hath bene therefore thought defectiue, if it haue not deliuered simply whatsoeuer is needfull to the same ende: but all kinds of knowledge haue their certaine bounds and limits; each of them presupposeth many necessary things learned in other sciences and knowne before hand. He that should take vpon him to teach men how to be eloquent in pleading causes, must needes deliuer vnto them whatsoeuer precepts are requisite vnto that end, otherwise he doth no
                  •
                the thing which he taketh vpon him. Seeing then no man can pleade eloquently, vnlesse he be able first to speake, it followeth that habilitie of speech is in this case a thing most necessary. Notwithstanding euery man would thinke it ridiculous, that he which vndertaketh by writing to instruct an Orator, should therfore deliuer all the precepts of Grammar; because his profession is to deliuer precepts necessarie vnto eloquent speech, yet so, that they which are to receiue them bee taugt before hand, so much of that which is thereunto necessarie as comprehendeth the skill of speaking. In like sort, albeit Scripture do professe to conteine in it all thinges which are necessarie vnto saluation; yet the meaning cannot bee simply of all things which are necessarie, but all things that are necessary in some certaine kind or forme; as all things that are necessarie, and either could not at all, or could not easilie be knowne by the light of naturall discourse; all things which are necessarie to be knowne that we may be saued, but knowne with presupposall of knowledge cōcerning certaine principles, wherof it receaueth vs already perswaded, and then instructeth vs in all the residue that are necessary. In the number of these principles one is the sacred authority of Scripture. Being therefore perswaded by other meanes that these Scriptures are the oracles of God▪ themselues do then teach vs the rest, and lay before vs all the duties which God requireth at our hands as necessary vnto saluation. Further, there hath bene some doubt likewise, whether conteining in scripture do import expresse setting downe in plaine tearmes, or else comprehending in such sort that by reason we may frō thence conclude all things which are necessary. Against the former of these two constructions, instance hath sundrie wayes bene geuen. For our beliefe in the Trinity, the Coeternity of the Sonne

of God with his Father, the proceeding of the Spirite from the Father and the Sonne, the duty of baptizing infants, these with such other principall points, the necessity wherof is by none denied, are notwithstanding in Scripture no where to be found by expresse literall mention, only deduced they are out of scripture by collection. This kind of cōprehension in scripture being therefore receiued, still there is no doubt how far we are to proceed by collection, before the full and complete measure of things necessary be made vp. For let vs not thinke that as long as the world doth endure▪ the wit of man shalbe able to found the bottome of that which may be concluded out of the scripture; especially if things conteined by collection do so far extend, as to draw in whatsoeuer may be at any time out of scripture but probably and coniecturally surmised. But let necessary collection be made requisite, and we may boldly deny, that of all those things which at this day are with so great necessitie vrged vpon this Church vnder the name of reformed Church discipline, there is any one which their bookes hetherto haue made manifest to be conteined in the Scripture. Let them if they can alleage but one properly belonging to their cause, and not common to them and vs, and shew the deduction thereof out of scripture to be necessarie. It hath beene already shewed, how all things necessarie vnto saluation in such sort as before we haue maintained, must needes be possible for men to knowe; and that many things are in such sort necessarie, the knowledge whereof is by the light of nature impossible to be attained. Whereupon it followeth, that either all flesh is excluded from possibility of saluation, which to thinke were most barbarous; or else that God hath by supernaturall meanes reuealed the way of life so far forth as doth suffice. For this cause God hath so many times and waies spoken to the sonnes of men. Neither hath he by speech only, but by wilting also instructed and taught his Church. The cause of writing hath bene to the end that things by him reuealed vnto the world, might haue the longer cō
               tinuance, and the greater certainty of assurance; by how much that which standeth on record, hath in both those respects preeminence aboue that which passeth from hand to hand, and hath no pennes but the toongs, no bookes but the eares of men to record it. The seueral bookes of scripture hauing had each some seuerall occasion and particular purpose which caused them to be written, the contents thereof are according to the exigence of that speciall end whereunto they are intended. Hereupon it groweth, that euery booke of holy scripture doth take out of all kinds of truth, Eph. 5.29. naturall, 2. Tim. 3.8. historicall, Tit. 1.12. forreine, 2. Pet. 2.4. supernaturall, so much as the matter handled requireth. Now for as much as there hath bene reason alleaged sufficient to conclude, that all things necessary vnto saluation must be made knowne, and that God himselfe hath therefore reuealed his will, because otherwise men could not haue knowne so much as i
                  •
                necessary; his surceasing to speake to the world since the publishing of the Gospell of Iesus Christ, and the deliuery of the same in writing, is vnto vs a manifest token that the way of saluation is now sufficiently opened, and that we neede no other meanes for our full instruction, then God hath already furnished vs withall.

                So that the generall ende both of olde and newe is one; the difference betweene them consisting in this, that the olde did make wise by teaching saluation through Christ that should come; the newe by teaching that Christ the Sauiour is come, and that Iesus whom the Iewes did crucifie, and whom God did raise againe from the dead, is he. When the Apostle therefore affirmeth vnto Timothie, that the old was able to make him wise to saluation, it was not his meaning that the olde alone can do this vnto vs which liue sithence the publication of the newe. For he speaketh with presupposall of the doctrine of Christ knowne also vnto Timothie; and therefore first it is sayd, Continue thou in those things which thou hast learned and art perswaded, knowing of whom thou hast bene taught them.

VVherefore without the doctrine of the new Testament teaching that Christ hath wrought the redemption of the world, which redemption the olde did foreshewe he should worke; it is not the former alone which can on our behalfe performe so much as the Apostle doth auouch, who presupposeth this when he magnifieth that so highly. And as his words concerning the bookes of auncient Scripture, do not take place but with presupposall of the Gospell of Christ embraced: so our owne wordes also when wee extoll the complete sufficiency of the whole intire body of the Scripture, must in like sorte bee vnderstood with this caution, that the benefite of natures light be not thought excluded as vnnecessarie, because the necessitie of a diuiner light is magnified. There is in Scripture therefore no defect, but that any man what place or calling soeuer he hold in the Church of God, may haue thereby the light of his naturall vnderstanding so perfected, that the one being relieued by the other, there can want no part of needfull instruction vnto any good worke which God himselfe requireth, be it naturall or supernaturall, belonging simply vnto men as men, or vnto men as they are vnited in whatsoeuer kinde of societie. It sufficeth therefore that nature and Scripture do serue in such full sort, that they both ioyntly, and not seuerally either of them, be so complete, that vnto euerlasting felicitie we need not the knowledge of any thing more then these two may easily furnish our mindes with on all sides: and therefore they which adde traditions as a part of supernaturall necessarie truth, haue not the truth, but are in errour. For they onely pleade, that whatsoeuer God reuealeth as necessary for all Christian men to do or beleeue, the same we ought to embrace, whether we haue receiued it by writing or otherwise; which no man denieth: when that which they should confirme who claime so great reuerence vnto traditions is, that the same traditions are necessarily to bee acknowledged diuine and holy. For wee doe not reiect them onely because they are not in the Scripture, but because they are neither in Scripture, nor can otherwise sufficiently by any reason be proued to be of God. That which is of God, and may be euidently proued to be so, we deny not but it hath in his kind, although vnwritten, yet the selfe same force and authoritie with the

written lawes of God. It is by ours acknowledged,VVhitake

For bothe being knowne to be Apostolicall, it is not the manner of deliuering them vnto the Church▪ but the author from whom they proceed, which doth giue them their force and credite.

Impossible it is but that they should fall into a number of grosse errors, who onely take such lawes for positiue, as haue bene made or inuented of men, and holding this position hold also, that all positiue and none but positiue lawes are mutable. Lawes naturall do alwayes bind; lawes positiue not so, but onely after they haue bene expresly and wittingly imposed. Lawes positiue there are in euery of those kindes before mentioned. As in the first kinde the promises which we haue past vnto men, and the vowes we haue made vnto God; for these are lawes which we tye our selues vnto, and till we haue so tied our selues they bind vs not. Lawes positiue in the second kind are such the ciuill constitutions peculiar vnto each particular common weale. In the third kind the law of Heraldy in wa

And although no lawes but positiue be mutable, yet all are not mutable which be positiue. Positiue lawes are either permanent or else changeable▪ according as the matter it selfe is concerning which they were first made. Whether God or man be the maker of them, alteration they so far forth admit, as the matter doth exact. Lawes that concerne supernaturall duties, are all positiue▪ and either cōcerne men supernaturally as men, or else as parts of a supernaturall society, which society we call the Church. To concerne men as men supernaturally, is to concerne them as duties which belong of necessitie to all, and yet could not haue bene knowne by any to belong vnto them, vnlesse God had opened them himselfe, in as much as they do not depend vpon any naturall ground at all out of which they may be deduced, but are appoi
                  ••
               ed of God to supply the defect of those naturall wayes of saluation, by which we are not now able to attaine thereunto. The Church being a supernaturall societie, doth differ from naturall societies in this; that the persons vnto whom wee associate our selues, in the one are men simply considered as men; but they to whom we bee ioyned in the other, are God, Angels, and holy men. Againe the Church being both a society, and a society supernaturall; although as it is a society, it haue the selfe same originall grounds which other politique societes haue, namely the naturall inclination which all men haue vnto sociable life, and consent to some certaine bond of association, which bond is

the law that appointeth what kind of order they shall be associated in: yet vnto the Church as it is a societie supernaturall this is peculiar, that part of the bond of their association which belong to the Church of God, must be a lawe supernaturall, which God himselfe hath reuealed concerning that kind of worship which his people shall do vnto him. The substance of the seruice of God therefore, so farre forth as it hath in it any thing more then the lawe of reason doth teach, may not be inuented of men, as it is amongst the Heathens; but must be receiued from God himselfe, as alwaies it hath bene in the Church, sauing only when the Church hath bene forgetfull of her dutie. Wherefore to end with a generall rule concerning all the lawes which God hath tyed men vnto:Esa. 29.13. Their feare towards me was taught by the precept of men. those lawes diuine that belong whether naturally or supernaturally, either to men as men, or to men as they liue in politique societie, or to men as they are of that politique societie which is the Church, without any further respect had vnto any such variable accident as the state of men and of societies of men and of the Church it selfe in this world is subiect vnto; all lawes that so belong vnto men, they belong for euer, yea although they be positiue lawes, vnlesse being positiue God himselfe which made them alter them. The reason is, because the subiect or matter of lawes in generall is thus farre foorth constant: which matter is that for the ordering whereof lawes were instituted, and being instituted are not chaungeable without cause, neither can they haue cause of chaunge, when that which gaue them their first institution, remaineth for euer one and the same. On the other side lawes that were made for men or societies or Churches, in regard of their being such as they doe not alwayes continue, but may perhaps bee cleane otherwise a whil
                  •
                after, and so may require to bee otherwise ordered then before: the lawes of God himselfe which are of this nature, no man indued with common sense will euer denie to bee of a different constitution from the former, in respect of the ones constancie, and the mutabilitie of the other. And this doth seeme to haue beene the very cause why Saint Iohn doth so peculiarly tearme the doctrine that teacheth saluation by Iesus Christ,Apoc. 14.6. 
               Euangelium aeternum, an eternall Gospell; because there can be no reason wherefore the publishing thereof should be taken away, and any other in stead of it proclaimed,

Polit. as long as the world doth continue: where as the whole lawe of rites and Ceremonies, although deliuered with so great solemnitie, is notwithstanding cleane abrogated, in as much as it had but temporary cause of Gods ordeining it. But that we may at the length conclude this first generall introduction vnto the nature and originall birth, as of all other lawes, so likewise of those which the sacred Scripture conteineth, concerning the author wherof, euen infidels haue confessed, that he can neither erre nor deceiue; albeit about things easie and manifest vnto all men by common sense there needeth no higher consultation, because as a man whose wisedome is in waighty affaires admired, would take it in some disdaine to haue his counsell solemnely asked about a toye, so the meannesse of some things is such that to search the Scripture of God for the ordering of them were to derogate from the reuerend authoritie and dignitie of the Scripture, no lesse then they do by whom Scriptures are in ordinarie talke very idly applyed

vnto vaine and childish trifles: yet better it were to bee superstitious, then prophane; to take from thence our direction euen in all things great or small, then to wade through matters of principall waight and moment, without euer caring what the lawe of God hath, either for or against our disseignes.

Nowe lawes or statutes are of two sorts. For they are either receiued from Gods, or else from men. And our auncient predecessors did surely most honor and reuerēce that which was from the Gods; for which cause consultation with Oracles was a thing very vsuall and frequent in their times. Did they make so much account of the voyce of their Gods, which in truth were no Gods: and shall we neglect the pretious benefite of conference with those Oracles of the true and liuing God, whereof so great store is left to the Church, and wherunto there is so free, so plaine, and so easie accesse for al men?

Wherfore seeing that God hath indued vs with sense, to the end that we might perceiue such things as this present life doth need, and with reason, least that which sense cannot reach vnto, being both now and also in regard of a future estate hereafter necessary to be knowne, should lye obscure; finally with the heauenly support of d propheticall reuelation, which doth open those hidden mysteries that reason could neuer haue bene able to find out,

            16 Thus farre therefore we haue endeuoured in part to open,Philo de Mos. A conclusion shewing how all this belongeth to the cause in question. of what nature and force lawes are, according vnto their seuerall kinds; the lawe which God with himselfe hath eternally set downe to follow in his owne workes; the law which he hath made for his creatures to keepe, the law of naturall and necessarie agents; the law which Angels in heauen obey; the lawe whereunto by the light of reason men find themselues bound in that they are men; the lawe which they make by composition for multitudes and politique societies of men to be guided by; the law which belongeth vnto each nation; the lawe that concerneth the fellowship of all; and lastly the lawe which God himselfe

hath supernaturally reuealed. It might peraduenture haue beene more popular and more plausible to vulgar eares, if this first discourse had beene spent in extolling the force of lawes, in shewing the great necessity of them when they are good; and in aggrauating their offence by whom publique lawes are iniuriously traduced. But for as much as with such kind of matter the passions of men are rather stirred one way or other, then their knowledge any way set forward vnto the triall of that whereof there is doubt made; I haue therefore turned aside from that beaten path, and chosen though a lesse easie, yet a more profitable way in regard of the end we propose. Least therefore any man should maruail

                whereunto all these things tend, the drift and purpose of all is this, euen to shew in what manner as euery good and perfect gift,Iam. 117. so this very gift of good and perfect lawes is deriued from the father of lights; to teach men a reason why iust and reasonable lawes are of so great force, of so great vse in the world; and to enforme their minds with some methode of reducing the lawes whereof there is present controuersie vnto their first originall causes, that so it may be in euery particular ordinance thereby the better discerned, whether the same be reasonable iust and righteous or no. Is there any thing which can either be throughly vnderstood, or soundly iudged of, till the very first causes and principles from which originally it springeth bee made manifest? If all parts of knowledge haue beene thought by wise men to bee then most orderly deliuered and proceeded in,Arist. Phys. II. 1. cap. 1. when they are drawne to their first originall▪ seeing that our whole question concerneth the qualitie of Ecclesiasticall lawes, let it not seeme a labour superfluous that in the entrance thereunto all these seuerall kinds of lawes haue beene considered, in as much as they all concurre as principles, they all haue their forcible operations therein, although not all in like apparent and manifest maner. By meanes whereof it commeth to passe, that the force which they haue is not obserued of many. Easier a great deale it is for men by law to be taught what they ought to do, then instructed how to iudge as they should do of law; the one being a thing which belongeth generally vnto all, the other such as none but the wiser and more iudicious sorte can performe.Arist. Eth. 10. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Intelligit de legum qualitate iudicium. Yea the wisest are alwayes touching this point the readiest to acknowledge, that soundly to iudge of a law is the waightiest thing which any man can take vpon him. But if we wil giue iudgement of the laws vnder which we liue, first let that law eternall be alwayes before our eyes, as being of principall force and moment to breed in religious minds a dutifull estimation of all lawes, the vse and benefite whereof we see; because there can be no doubt but that lawes apparently good, are (as it were) things copied out of the very tables of that high euerlasting law, euen as the booke of that law hath said concerning it selfe, By me Kings raigne, and by me Princes decree iustice. Not as if men did behold that booke,Prou. 8.15. and accordingly frame their lawes; but because it worketh in them▪ because it discouereth and (as it were) readeth it selfe to the world by them, when the lawes which they make are righteous. Furthermore although we perceiue not the goodnesse of lawes made; neuerthelesse sith things in themselues may haue that which we peraduenture; discerne not; should not this breed a feare in our harts, how we speake or iudge in the worse part concerning that, the vnaduised disgrace whereof may be no meane dishonour to him, towards whom

we professe all submission and awe? Surely there must be very manifest iniquitie in lawes, against which we shall be able to iustifie our contumelious inuectiues. The chiefest roote whereof, when we vse them without cause, is ignorance how lawes inferiour are deriued from that supreme or highest lawe. The first that receiue impression from thence are naturall agents. The lawe of whose operations might be happily thought lesse pertinent, when the question is about lawes for humane actions, but that in those very actions which most spiritually and supernaturally concerne men, the rules and axiomes of naturall operations haue their force. What can be more immediate to our saluation, then our perswasion concerning the lawe of Christ towardes his Church? What greater assurance of loue towards his Church, then the knowledge of that mysticall vnion whereby the Church is become as neare vnto Christ, as any one part of his flesh is vnto other? That the Church being in such sort his, he must needes protect it; what proofe more strong, then if a manifest lawe so require, which law it is not possible for Christ to violate? And what other lawe doth the Apostle for this alleage, but such as is both common vnto Christ with vs, and vnto vs with other things naturall, No man hateth his owne flesh, but doth loue and cherish it? The axiomes of that lawe therefore, whereby naturall agentes are guided,Eph. 5.29. haue their vse in the morall, yea euen in the spirituall actions of men, and consequently in all lawes belonging vnto men howsoeuer. Neither are the Angels themselues, so farre seuered from vs in their kind and manner of working, but that betweene the lawe of their heauenly operations, and the actions of men in this our state of mortalitie, such correspondence there is, as maketh it expedient to know in some sort the one, for the others more perfect direction.Apoc. 19.10. Would Angels acknowledge themselues fellow seruants with the sonnes of men, but that both hauing one Lord, there must be some kinde of lawe which is one and the same to both, whereunto their obedience being perfecter, is to our weaker both a paterne and a spurre?1. Pet. 1.12. Eph. 3.10. 1. Tim. 5.21. Or would the Apostle speaking of that which belongeth vnto Saintes, as they are linked together in the bond of spirituall societie, so often make mention how Angels are therewith delighted, if in thinges publiquely done by the Church we are not somewhat to respect what the Angels of heauen doe? Yea so farre hath the Apostle S. Paule proceeded,1. Cor. 11.10 as to signifie that euen about the outward orders of the Church which serue but for comelinesse, some regard is to be had of Angels; who best like vs when we are most like vnto them in all partes of decent demeanor. So that the law of Angels wee cannot iudge altogether impertinent vnto the affaires of the Church of God. Our largenesse of speech how men do finde out what thinges reason bindeth them of necessitie to obserue, and what is guideth them to choose in things which are left as arbitrary; the care we haue had to declare the different nature of lawes which seuerally concerne all men, from such as belong vnto men eyther ciuilly or spiritually associated, such as pertaine to the fellowship which nations, or which Christian nations haue amongst themselues, and in the last place such as concerning euery or any of these, God himselfe hath reuealed by his holy wor
                  •
               , all serueth but to make manifest, that as the actions of men are of sundry distinct kindes, so the lawes thereof must accordingly be distinguished. There are in men operations some naturall, some rationall, some supernaturall,

some politique, some finally Ecclesiasticall. Which if we measure not each by his owne proper law, whereas the things themselues are so different; there will be in our vnderstanding and iudgement of them confusion. As that first error sheweth whereon our opposites in this cause haue grounded themselues. For as they rightly maintaine, that God must be glorified in all thinges, and that the actions of men cannot tend vnto his glory, vnlesse they be framed after his law: So it is their error, to thinke that the only law which God hath appointed vnto men in that behalfe is the sacred Scripture. By that which we worke naturally, as when we breath,Ps. 148.7, 8, 9. sleepe, mooue, we set forth the glory of God as naturall agents doe, albeit we haue no expresse purpose to make that our end, nor any aduised determination therein to follow a law, but doe that we doe (for the most part) not as much as thinking thereon. In reasonable and morall actions another law taketh place,Rom. 1.21. a law by the obseruation whereof we glorifie God in such sort, as no creature else vnder man is able to doe; because other creatures haue not iudgement to examine the qualitie of that which is done by them, and therfore in that they doe, they neither can accuse nor approue themselues. Men doe bothe,Rom. 2.15. as the Apostle teacheth; yea those men which haue no written lawe of God to shewe what is good or euill, carrie written in their hearts the vniuersall lawe of mankind, the law of reason, whereby they iudge as by a rule which God hath giuen vnto all men for that purpose. The lawe of reason doth somewhat direct men how to honour God as their Creator; but how to glorifie God in such sort as is required, to the end he may be an euerlasting Sauiour, this we are taught by diuine law, which law both ascertaineth the truth and supplieth vnto vs the want of that other lawe. So that in morall actions, diuine law helpeth exceedingly the lawe of reason to guide mans life; but in supernaturall it alone guideth. Proceed wee further, let vs place man in some publique societie with others, whether Ciuill or Spirituall: and in this case there is no remedie but we must adde yet a further lawe. For although euen here likewise the lawes of nature and reason be of necessary vse; yet somewhat ouer and besides them is necessary, namely humane and positiue lawe, together with that lawe which is of commerce betweene grand societies, the law of nations and of nations Christian. For which cause the lawe of God hath likewise said, Let euery soule be subiect to the higher powers.
               Rom. 13.1. The publique power of all societies is aboue euery soule contained in the same societies. And the principall vse of that power is to giue lawes vnto all that are vnder it; which lawes in such case we must obey, vnlesse there be reason shewed which may necessarily enforce, that the lawe or reason or of God doth enioyne the contrarie. Because except our owne priuate, and but probable resolutions, be by the lawe of publique determinations ouerruled; we take away all possibilitie of sociable life in the worlde. A plainer example whereof then our selues we cannot haue. How commeth it to passe that wee are at this present day so rent with mutuall contentions, and that the Church is so much troubled about the politie of the Church? No doubt if men had bene willing to learne how many lawes their actions in this life are subiect vnto, and what the true force of each lawe is, all these controuersies might haue dyed the very day they were first brought forth. It is both commonly said, and truly, that the best men otherwise are not alwayes the best in regard of societie. The

reason wherof is, for that the law of mens actions is one, if they be respected only as men; and another, whē they are considered as parts of a politique body.

And yet in societie with others, none lesse fit to answere the duties which are looked for at their handes. Yea I am perswaded, that of them with whom in this cause we striue, there are whose betters among men would bee hardly found, if they did not liue amongst men, but in some wildernesse by themselues. The cause of which their disposition so vnframable vnto societies wherein they liue, is for that they discerne not aright: what place and force these seuerall kindes of lawes ought to haue in all their actions.

And least appetite in the vse of foode, should leade vs beyond that which is meere▪ we owe in this case obedience to that law of reason, which teacheth mediocritie in meates and drinkes. The same things diuine lawe teacheth also, as at large we haue shewed it doth all partes of morall dutie, whereunto we all of necessitie stand bound, in regard of the life to come. But of certaine kindes of foode the Iewes sometime had, and we our selues likewise haue, a mysticall, reli

Yea the selfe same matter is also a subiect wherein sometime Ecclesiasticall lawes haue place; so that vnlesse wee will bee authors of confusion in the Church, our priuate discretion, which otherwise might guide vs a contrary way, must here submit it selfe to bee that way guided, which the publike iudgement of the Church hath thought better.

And as here mens priuate phansies must giue place to the higher iudgement of that Church which is in authoritie a mother ouer them: so the very actions of whole Churches, haue in regard of commerce and fellowship with other Churches, bene subiect to lawes concerning foode,Act. 15.20. the contrarie vnto which lawes had else bene thought more conuenient for them to obserue; as by that order of abstinence from strangled and bloud may appeare; an order grounded vpon that fellowship which the Churches of the Gentiles had with the Iewes. Thus we see how euen one and the selfe same thing is vnder diuers considerations conueyed through many lawes; and that to measure by any one kind of law all the action of men, were to confound the admirable order wherein God hath disposed all lawes, each as in nature, so in degree, distinct from other. Wherefore that here we may briefly ende, of lawe there can be no lesse acknowledged, then that her seate is the bosome of God, her voyce the harmony of the world, all things in heauen and earth doe her homage, the very least as feeling her care, and the greatest as not exempted from her power; both Angels and men and creatures of what condition so euer, though each in different sort and manner, yet all with vniforme consent, admiring her as the mother of their peace and ioy.

               AS that which in the title hath bene proposed for the matter whereof we treat, is onely the Ecclesiasticall lawe whereby we are gouerned; So neither is it my purpose to maintaine any other thing, then that which therein truth and reason shall approue. For concerning the dealings of men who administer gouernment, and vnto whom the execution of that law belongeth; they haue their iudge who sitteth in heauen, and before whose tribunall seate they are accomptable for whatsoeuer abuse or corruption, which (being worthily misliked in this Church) the want eyther of care or of conscience in them hath bred. We are no Patrones of those things therfore; the best defence whereof is speedie redresse & amendment. That which is of God we defend, to the vttermost of that habilitie which he hath giuen: that which is otherwise, let it wither euen in the roote from whence it hath sprung. Wherefore all these abuses being seuered and set apart, which rise from the corruption of men, and not from the lawes themselues: come we to those things which in the very whole intier forme of our Church-politie

haue bene (as wee perswade our selues) iniuriously blamed, by them who endeuour to ouerthrow the same, and in stead therof to establish a much worse▪ onely through a strong misconceipt they haue, that the same is grounded on diuine authoritie. Now whether it be that through an earnest longing desire to see things brought to a peaceable end, I do but imagine the matters whereof we contend, to be fewer then indeed they are; or else for that in truth they are fewer when they come to be discust by reason, then otherwise they seeme, when by heate of contention they are deuided into many slippes, and of euery branch an heape is made: surely as now wee haue drawne them together, choosing out those things which are requisite to bee seuerally all discust, and omitting such meane specialties as are likely (without any great labour) to fall afterwardes of themselues; I knowe no cause why either the number or the length of these controuersies should diminish our hope, of seeing them end with concord and loue on all sides; which of his infinite loue and goodnes the father of all peace and vnitie graunt. Vnto which scope that our endeuour may the more directly tend, it seemeth fittest that first those thinges be examined, which are as seedes from whence the rest that ensue haue growne. And of such the most generall is that, wherewith we are here to make our entrance; a question not mooued (I thinke) any where in other Churches, and therefore in ours the more likely to be soone (I trust) determined. The rather for that it hath grown from no other roote, then only a desire to enlarge the necessarie vse of the word of God; which desire hath begotten an error enlarging it further then (as we are perswaded) soundnesse of truth will beare. For whereas God hath left sundry kindes of lawes vnto men, and by all those lawes the actions of men are in some sort directed:T.C. l. 1. p. 59. & 60. they hold that one onely lawe, the scripture, must be the rule to direct in all thinges, euen so farre as to the taking vp of a rush or strawe. About which point there should not neede any question to growe, and that which is growne might presently ende, if they did yeelde but to these two restraints: the first is, not to extend the actions whereof they speake so lowe as that instance doth import, of taking vp a strawe, but rather keepe themselues at the least within the compasse of morall actions, actions which haue in them vice or vertue; the second, not to exact at our hands for euery action the knowledge of some place of scripture out of which we stand bound to deduce it, as by diuerse testimonies they seeke to enforce, but rather as the truth is, so to acknowledge, that it sufficeth if such actions be framed according to the lawe of reason; the generall axiomes, rules, and principles of which lawe being so frequent in holy scripture, there is no let but in that regard, euen out of scripture such duties may be deduced by some kinde of consequence, (as by long circuite of deduction it may be that euen all truth out of any truth may be concluded); howbeit no man bound in such sort to deduce all his actions out of scripture, as if eyther the place be to him vnknowne whereon they may be concluded, or the reference vnto that place not presently considered of, the action shall in that respect be condemned as vnlawfull. In this we dissent, and this we are presently to examine.
            
               The first pretended proofe of the first position out of scripture. Pro. 2.9. T.C .l. 1. p. 20. I say that the word of God containeth whatsoeuer things can fall into any part of mans life. For so Salomon saith in the 2. chapter of the Prouerbes, My sonne, if thou receiue my words &c. then thou shalt vnderstand iustice, and iudgement, & equitie, and euery goodway.
               1 In all parts of knowledge rightly so termed, thinges most generall are most strong: Thus it must be, in as much as the certaintie of our perswasion touching

particulars, dependeth altogether vpon the credite of those generalities out of which they growe. Albeit therefore euery cause admit not such infallible euidence of proofe, as leaueth no possibilitie of doubt or scruple behind it; yet they who claime the generall assent of the whole world vnto that which they teach, and doe not feare to giue very hard and heauie sentence vpon as many as refuse to embrace the same, must haue speciall regard that their first foundations and grounds be more then slender probabilities. This whole question which hath bene mooued about the kinde of Church regiment, we could not but for our owne resolutions sake, endeuour to vnrip and sift; following therein as neare as we might, the conduct of that iudiciall method which serueth best for inuention of truth. By meanes whereof hauing found this the head theoreme of all their discourses, who pleade for the chaunge of Ecclesiasticall gouernment in England, namely, That the Scripture of God is in such sort the rule of humane actions, that simply whatsoeuer we doe, and are not by it directed thereunto, the same is sinne; wee hold it necessarie that the proofes hereof be waighed: be they of waight sufficient or otherwise it is not ours to iudge and determine: onely what difficulties there are, which as yet withhold our assent, till we be further and better satisfied, I hope no indifferent amongst them will scorne or refuse to heare. First therefore whereas they alleage that wisedome doth teach men euery good way; and haue thereupon inferred, that no way is good in any kind of action, vnlesse wisedome do by scripture leade vnto it: see they not plainely how they restraine the manifold wayes which wisedome hath to teach men by, vnto one only way of teaching, which is by scripture? The boundes of wisedome are large, and within them much is contayned. Wisdome was Adams instructor in Paradise: wisdome indued the fathers, who liued before the law, with the knowledge of holy things by the wisedome of the lawe of God, Dauid attained to excell others in vnderstanding; & Salomon likewise to excell Dauid,
               Psal. 119.95. by the selfe same wisdome of God teaching him many things besides the law. The waies of well-doing are in number euen as many, as are the kindes of voluntarie actions: so that whatsoeuer we do in this world and may do it ill, we shew our selues therein by well doing to be wise▪ Now if wisedome did teach men by scripture not onely all the wayes that are right and good in some certaine kind, according to that of 2. Tim. 3 16. The whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to instruct in righteousnes, that the man of God may be absolute being made perfect vnto all good works. He meaneth all and only those good workes, which belong vnto vs as we are men of God, and which vnto saluation are necessary. Or if we vnderstand by men of God, Gods Ministers▪ there is not required in them an vniuersall skill of euery good worke or way, but an habilitie to teach whatsoeuer men are bound to doe that they may be saued. And with this kinde of knowledge the scripture sufficeth to furnish them as touching matter. S. Paule concerning the vse of scripture; but did simply without any maner of exception, restraint, or distinction, teach euery way of doing well; there is no art but scripture should teach it, because euery art doth teach the way how to do some thing or other well. To teach men therefore wisedome professeth, and to teach them euery good way: but not euery good way by one way of teaching. Whatsoeuer either men on earth, or the Angels of heauen do know, it is as a drop of that vnemptiable fountaine of wisdom; which wisdom hath diuersly imparted her treasures vnto the world. As her waies are of sundry kindes, so her maner of teaching is not meerely one and the same. Some thinges she openeth by the sacred bookes of Scripture; some things by the glorious works of nature: with some things she inspireth them frō aboue by spirituall

influence; in some things she leadeth and traineth them onely by worldly experience and practise. We may not so in any one speciall kinde admire her, that we disgrace her in any other; but let all her wayes be according vnto their place and degree adored.
            
               The second proofe out of Scripture. 1. Cor. 10.31. T.C. l. 1. p. 16. S. Paul saith that whether we eat or drink or whatsoeuer we do, we must do it to the glory of God. But no man can glorifie God in any thing but by obedience; and there is no obedience but in respect of the commaundement and word of God: Therefore is followeth that the word of God directeth a man in all his actions.
               2 That all things be done to the glory of God, the blessed Apostle (it is true) exhorteth. The glory of God is the admirable excellencie of that vertue diuine, which being made manifest, causeth men and Angels to extoll his greatnes, and in regard thereof to feare him. By beeing glorified, it is not meant that he doth receiue any augmentation of glory at our hands; but his name we glorifie, when we testifie our acknowledgement of his glorie. Which albeit we most effectually do by the vertue of obedience: neuerthelesse it may be perhaps a question, whether S. Paule did meane that wee sinne as oft as euer wee goe about any thing, without an expresse intent and purpose to obey God therein. He saith of himselfe, I do in all things please all men, seeking not mine owne commoditie, but rather the good of many, that they may be saued. Shall it hereupon be thought, that S. Paule did not moue eyther hand or foote, but with expresse intent euen thereby to further the common saluation of men? We moue, we sleepe, wee take the cuppe at the hand of our friend, a number of thinges we oftentimes doe, onely to satisfie some naturall desire, without present expresse and actuall reference vnto any commaundement of God. Vnto his glory euen these thinges are done which we naturally performe, and not onely that which morally and spiritually we doe. For by euery effect proceeding from the most concealed instincts of nature, his power is made manifest. But it doth not therefore follow, that of necessitie we shall sinne, vnlesse we expressely intend this in euery such particular. But be it a thing which requireth no more then onely our generall presupposed willingnesse to please God in all things; or be it a matter wherein wee cannot so glorifie the name of God as we should, without an actuall intent to doe him in that particular some speciall obedience: yet for any thing there is in this sentence alleaged to the contrarie, God may be glorified by obedience, and obeyed by performance of his will, and his will be performed with an actuall intelligent desire to fulfill that lawe which maketh knowne what his will is, although no speciall clause or sentence of scripture bee in euery such action set before mens eyes to warrant it. For scripture is not the onely lawe whereby God hath opened his will touching all thinges that may be done; but there are other kindes of lawes which notifie the will of God, as in the former booke hath beene prooued at large: Nor is there any law of God, whereunto he doth not account our obedience his glory. Doe therefore all thinges vnto the glory of God (saith the Apostle), be inoffensiue both to the Iewes and Graecians, and the Church of God; euen as I please all men in all thinges, not seeking mine owne commoditie, but manies that they may be saued. In the least thing done disobediently towardes God, or offensiuely against the good of men, whose benefite wee ought to seeke for as for our owne, we plainely shew that we doe not acknowledge God to be such as indeede he is, and consequently that we glorifie him not. This the blessed Apostle teacheth: but doth any Apostle teach, that we cannot glorifie God otherwise, then onely in doing what wee finde that God in Scripture commaundeth vs to doe? The Churches dispersed amongest the

Heathen in the East part of the world, are by the Apostle S. Peter exhorted, to haue their conuersation honest amongest the Gentiles,
               1. Pet. 2.12. 
               that they which spake euill of them as of euill doers, might by the good workes which they should see, glorifie God in the day of visitation. As long as that which Christians did was good, and no way subiect vnto iust reproofe; their vertuous conuersation was a meane to worke the Heathens conuersion vnto Christ. Seeing therefore this had beene a thing altogether impossible, but that Infidels themselues did discerne, in matters of life and conuersation, when beleeuers did well, and when otherwise; when they glorified their heauenly father, and when not: it followeth that some thinges wherein God is glorified, may be some other way knowne, then onely by the sacred Scripture; of which Scripture the Gentiles being vtterly ignorant, did notwithstanding iudge rightly of the qualitie of Christian mens actions.Rom. 2.34. Most certaine it is that nothing but onely sinne, doth dishonour God. So that to glorifie him in all things;1. Cor. 10.32. is to do nothing whereby the name of God may be blasphemed; nothing whereby the saluation of Iew or Grecian or any in the Church of Christ may be let or hindered; nothing wherby his law is transgrest.Rom. 2.23. But the question is, whether onely Scripture do shewe whatsoeuer God is glorified in.
            3 And though meates and drinkes be said to be sanctified by the worde of God, and by prayer: yet neither is this a reason sufficient to prooue,The third scripture prof. 1. Tim. 4.5. And that which S. Paul said of meats & drink
                        •

Onely it sheweth that vnto vs the worde, that is to say, the Gospell of Christ, hauing not deliuered any such difference of thinges cleane and vncleane, as the law of Moses did vnto the Iewes; there is no cause but that we may vse indifferently all thinges, as long as wee doe not (like swine) take the benefite of them, without a thankefull acknowledgement of his liberalitie and goodnesse, by whose prouidence they are inioyed: and therefore the Apostle gaue warning before hand to take heede of such as should inioyne to abstaine from meates, which God hath created to be receiued with thankes-giuing, by them which beleeue and know the truth. For euery creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be receiued with thankesgiuing,
               1. Tim. 4. 
               because it is sanctified by the word of God and praier. The Gospell by not making many thinges vncleane, as the lawe did, hath sanctified those thinges generally to all, which particularly each man vnto himselfe must sanctifie by a reuerend and holy vse: which will hardly be drawne so farre, as to serue their purpose, who haue imagined the word in such sort to sanctifie all thinges, that neither foode can bee tasted, nor rayment put on, nor in the world any thing done, but this deede must needes be sinne in them, which do not first knowe it appointed vnto them by scripture before they do it.
            4 But to come vnto that which of all other things in scripture is most stood vpon; that place of S. Paule they say, is of all other most cleare,
               The fourth Scripture-proofe. Rom. 14.23. T.C. lib. 1, p. 27. 
               where speaking of those thinges which are called indifferent, in the ende he concludeth, that whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne. But faith is not but in respect of the worde of God. Therefore whatsoeuer is not done by the worde of God, is sinne. Whereunto wee aunswere, that albeit the name of faith being properly and strictly taken, it must needes haue reference vnto some vttered worde, as the obiect of beliefe:

neuerthelesse sith the ground of credite is the credibilitie of thinges credited; and things are made credible, eyther by the knowne condition and qualitie of the vtterer,Psal. 19.8. Apoc. 3.14. or by the manifest likelihood of truth which they haue in thēselues; hereupon it riseth,2. Cor. 1.18. that whatsoeuer we are perswaded of, the same we are generally said to beleeue. In which generalitie, the obiect of faith may not so narrowly be restrained, as if the same did extend no further then to the onely scriptures of God.Ioh. 10.38. 
               Though (saith our Sauiour) ye beleeue not me, beleeue my workes; that ye may know and beleeue that the father is in me, and I in him. The other Disciples said vnto Thomas,Ioh. 20.25. 
               we haue seene the Lord; but his aunswere vnto them was, Except I see in his hands the print of the nailes, and put my finger into them, I will not beleeue. Can there be any thing more plaine, then that which by these two sentences appeareth, namely that there may be a certaine beliefe grounded vpon other assurance then Scripture; any thing more cleare, then that we are said not onely to beleeue the thinges which we knowe by anothers relation, but euen whatsoeuer we are certainly perswaded of, whether it be by reason, or by sense? For as much therefore as And if any will say, that S. Paule meaneth there a full 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and perswasion that that which hee doth is well done, I graunt it. But from whence can that spring but from faith? how can wee perswade and assure our selues that wee doe well, but whereas we haue the word of God for our warrant? T.C. lib. 1. cap. 27. it is graunted, that S. Paule doth meane nothing else by Fayth, but onely a full perswasion that that which we doe is well done; against which kinde of faith or perswasion, as S. Paule doth count it sinne to enterprise any thing, What also that some euen of those Heathen men haue taught, that nothing ought to be done, whereof thou doubtest whether it be right or wrong? Whereby it appeareth, that euen those which had no knowledge of the worde of God, did see much of the equitie of this which the Apostle requireth of a Christian man: and that the chiefest difference is, that where they sent men for the difference of good and euill to the light of reason, in such things the Apostle sendeth them to the Schoole of Christ in his worde, which onely is able through faith to giue them assurance and resolution in their doings. T.C. lib. 1. pag. 60. so likewise some of the very Heathen haue taught, as Tully, that nothing ought to be done whereof thou doubtest whether it be right or wrōg; wherby it appeareth that euen those which had no knowledge of the word of God, did see much of the equitie of this which the Apostle requireth of a Christian man: I hope we shall not seeme altogether vnnecessarily to doubt of the soundnesse of their opinion, who thinke simply that nothing but onely the word of God, can giue vs assurance in any thing wee are to doe, and resolue vs that we doe well. For might not the Iewes haue beene fully perswaded that they did well to thinke (if they had so thought) that in Christ God the father was, although the onely ground of this their faith, had beene the wonderfull workes they saw him do? Might not, yea did not Thomas fully in the end perswade himselfe, that he did well to thinke that body, which now was raised, to bee the same which had bene crucified? That which gaue Thomas this assurance was his sense;Ioh. 20.29. 
               Thomas because thou hast seene, thou beleeuest, saith our Sauiour. What scripture had Tully for his assurance? Yet I nothing doubt but that they who alleage him, thinke hee did well to set downe in writing a thing so consonant vnto truth. Finally, wee all beleeue that the Scriptures of God are sacred, and that they haue proceeded from God; our selues wee assure that wee doe right well in so beleeuing. Wee haue for this point a demonstration sound and infallible. But it is not the worde of God which doth or possibly can assure vs, that wee doe well to thinke it his worde. For if any one booke of Scripture did giue testimonie to all; yet still that Scripture which giueth credite to the rest, would require another Scripture to giue credite vnto it:

neither could we euer come vnto any pause whereon to rest our assurance this way: so that vnlesse besides scripture there were some thing which might assure vs that we do well, we could not thinke we do well, no not in being assured that scripture is a sacred and holy rule of well doing. On which determination we might be contented to stay our selues without further proceeding herein, but that we are drawne on into larger speech by reason of their so great earnestnes, who beate more and more vpon these last alleaged words, as being of all other most pregnant. Whereas therefore they still argue, that wheresoeuer faith is wanting, there is sinne, and in euery action not commaunded, faith is wanting;T.C. li. 2. p. 5
                     •
                  . 
               Ergo in euery action not commaunded, there is sinne: I would demaund of them, first for as much as the nature of things indifferent is neither to be commaunded nor forbidden, but left free and arbitrarie; how there can be any thing indifferent, if for want of faith sinne be committed, when any thing not commaunded is done. So that of necessitie they must adde somewhat, and at leastwise thus set it downe: In euery action not commaunded of God, or permitted with approbation, faith is wanting, and for want of faith there is sinne. The next thing we are to enquire is, what those things be which God permitteth with approbation, and how we may know them to be so permitted. When there are vnto one ende sundrie meanes, as for example, for the sustenance of our bodies many kindes of foode, many sorts of rayment to cloathe our nakednesse, and so in other things of like condition: here the end it selfe being necessary, but not so any one meane thereunto; necessarie that our bodies should be both fed and cloathed, howbeit no one kinde of foode or rayment necessary; therefore we hold these things free in their owne nature and indifferent. The choice is left to our owne discretion, except a principall bond of some higher dutie remoue the indifferencie that such thinges haue in themselues. Their indifferencie is remoued, if eyther wee take away our owne libertie, as Anantas did,Act. 5. for whome to haue solde or helde his possesions it was indifferent, till his solemne vow and promise vnto God had strictly bound him one onely way: or if God himselfe haue precisely abridged the same, by restraining vs vnto, or by barring vs from, some one or moe things of many, which otherwise were in themselues altogether indifferent. Many fashions of Priestly attire there were, wherof Aaron and his sonnes might haue had their free choice without sinne, but that God expressely tied them vnto one. All meates indifferent vnto the Iewe,Exod 28.4.43. Leuit. 11. were it not that God by name excepted some, as swines flesh. Impossible therefore it is we should otherwise thinke, then that what thinges God doth neither commaund nor forbid, the same he permitteth with approbation either to be done or left vndone. All thinges are lawfull vnto mee, saith the Apostle, speaking as it seemeth, in the person of the Christian Gentile for maintenance of libertie in thinges indifferent:1. Cor. 6.12. whereunto his answere is, that neuerthelesse All thinges are not expedient; in thinges indifferent there is a choice, they are not alwayes equally expedient. Now in thinges although not commaunded of God, yet lawfull because they are permitted, the question is, what light shall shewe vs the conueniencie which one hath aboue another. For answere, their finall determination is, that whereas the Heathen did send men for the difference of good & euill to the light of reason, in such things the Apostle sendeth vs to the schoole of Christ in his word, which onely is able through faith to giue vs

assurance and resolution in our doings. Which word Only, is vtterly without possibilitie of euer being proued. For what if it were true concerning things indifferent, that vnlesse the word of the Lord had determined of the free vse of them, there could haue bene no lawfull vse of them at all; which notwithstanding is vntrue, because it is not the Scriptures setting downe such thinges as indifferent, but their not setting downe as necessarie that doth make them to be indifferent: yet this to our present purpose serueth nothing at all. Wee inquire not now whether any thing be free to be vsed, which scripture hath not set downe as free: but concerning things knowne and acknowledged to be indifferent, whether particularly in choosing any one of them before another we sinne, if any thing but scripture direct vs in this our choice. When many meates are set before me, all are indifferent, none vnlawfull; I take one as most conuenient. If scripture require me so to do, then is not the thing indifferent, because I must do what scripture requireth. They are all indifferent, I might take any, scripture doth not require of me to make any speciall choice of one: I doe notwithstanding make choice of one, my discretion teaching me so to doe. A hard case, that hereupon I should be iustly condemned of sinne. Nor let any man thinke, that following the iudgement of naturall discretion in such cases, we can haue no assurance that we please God. For to the author and God of our nature, how shall any operation proceeding in naturall sort bee in that respect vnacceptable? The nature which himselfe hath giuen to worke by, he cannot but be delighted with, when wee exercise the same any way with
                  •
               ut commaundement of his to the contrarie. My desire is to make this cause so manifest, that if it were possible, no doubt or scruple concerning the same might remaine in any mans cogitation. Some truthes there are, the veritie whereof time doth alter: as it is now true that Christ is risen from the dead; which thing was not true at such time as Christ was liuing on earth, and had not suffered. It would be knowne therefore, whether this which they teach concerning the sinfull staine of all actions not commanded of God, be a truth that doth now appertaine vnto vs only, or a perpetuall truth, in such sort that from the first beginning of the world vnto the last consummation thereof, it neither hath bene, nor can be otherwise. I see not how they can restraine this vnto any particular time, how they can thinke it true now and not alwaies true, that in euery action not commanded there is for want of faith sinne. Then let them cast backe their eyes vnto former generations of men, and marke what was done in the prime of the world. Seth, Enoch, Noah, Sem, Abraham, Iob, and the rest that liued before any syllable of the lawe of God was written, did they not sinne as much as we doe in euery action not commaunded? That which God is vnto vs by his sacred word, the same he was vnto them by such like meanes as Eliphas in Iob describeth.Iob. 4.19. If therefore we sinne in euery action which the scripture commaundeth vs not, it followeth that they did the like in all such actions as were not by reuelation from heauen exacted at their hands. Vnlesse God from heauen did by vision still shew them what to doe, they might do nothing, not eate, not drinke, not sleepe, not moue. Yea but euen as in darkenes candle light may serue to guide mens steps, which to vse in the day were madnes; so when God had once deliuered his lawe in writing, it may bee they are of opinion, that then it must needes bee sinne for men to doe any thing,

which was not there commaunded them to do, whatsoeuer they might do before. Let this be graunted, and it shall here upon plainely ensue, either that the light of Scripture once shining in the world, all other light of nature is ther with in such sort drowned, that now we need it not, neither may we longer vse it;Arist. Pol. 1. or if it stand vs in any stead, yet as Aristotle speaketh of men whom nature hath framed for the state of seruitude, saying They haue reason so farre forth as to conceiue when others direct them, but litle or none in directing themselues by themselues, so likewise our naturall capacity and iudgement must serue vs only for the right vnderstanding of that which the sacred Scripture teacheth. Had the Prophets who succeeded Moses, or the blessed Apostles which followed them, bene setled in this perswasion, neuer would they haue taken so great paines in gathering together naturall arguments, thereby to teach the faithfull their duties. To vse vnto thē any other motiue then Scriptum est, Thus it is written▪
                had bene to teach them other grounds of their actions then scripture; which I graunt they alleage commonly, but not only. Only scripture they should haue alleaged, had they bene thus perswaded, that so far forth we do sinne, as we do any thing otherwise directed then by

               cripture. Saint Augustine was resolute in points of Christianity to credit none, how godly and learned soeuer he were, vnlesse he confirmed his sentence by the Scriptures, or by some reason not contrary to them.
               August, Ep. 18. Let them therfore with Saint Augustine reiect and condemne that which is not grounded either on the Scripture, or on some reason not contrary to Scripture▪ and we are ready to giue them our hands in token of friendly consent with them.
            5 But against this it may be obiected, and is,The first assertion indeuoured to be proued by the vse of taking arguments negatiuely from the authority of Scripture: which kind of disputing is vsuall in the Fathers. that the Fathers do nothing more vsually in their books, then draw arguments from the Scripture negatiuely in reproofe of that which is euill; Scriptures teach it not, auoid it therefore; these disputes with the Fathers are ordinary, neither is it hard to shew that the Prophets themselues haue so reasoned. Which arguments being sound and good, it should seeme that it cannot be vnsound or euill to hold still the same assertion against which hitherto we haue disputed. For if it stand with reason thus to argue, Such a thing is not taught vs in Scripture, therefore we may not receiue or allow it; how should it seeme vnreasonable to thinke, that whatsoeuer we may lawfully do, the Scripture by commanding it must make it lawful. But how far such arguments do reach, it shall the better appeare by considering the matter wherein they haue bene vrged. First therefore this we constantly deny, that of so many testimonies as they are able to produce for the strength of negatiue arguments, any one doth generally (which is the point in question) condemne either all opinions as false, or all actions as vnlawfull, which the scripture teacheth vs not. The most that can be collected out of thē is onely, that in some cases a negatiue argument taken from scripture is strong; whereof no man indued with iudgement can doubt. But doth the strength of some negatiue argumen
                  •
                proue this kind of negatiue argument strong, by force whereof all things are denied which Scripture affirmeth not, or all things which Scripture prescribeth not, condemned▪ The question betweene vs is concerning matter of action, what things are lawfull or vnlawfull for men to do. The sentences alleaged out of the Fathers, are as peremptory and as large in euery respect for matter of opinion, as of action▪ which argueth that in truth they neuer meant any otherwise

to tye the one then the other vnto scripture, bothe being thereunto equally tyed, as far as each is required in the same kind of necessitie vnto saluation. If therefore it be not vnlawful to know, and with full perswasion to belieue, much more then scripture alone doth teach; if it be against all sense and reason to condemne the knowledge of so many arts and sciences as are otherwise learned then in holy scripture, notwithstanding the manifest speeches of auncient Catholike fathers, which seeme to close vp within the bosome thereof all manner good and lawfull knowledge▪ wherefore should their words be thought more effectuall, to shew that we may not in deedes and practise, then they are to proue that in speculation and knowledge, we ought not to go any farther then the scripture? Which scripture being giuen to teach matters of beliefe no lesse then of action▪ the Fathers must needs be, and are euen as plaine against credit, besides the relation; as against practise, without the iniunction of the scripture. Saint Augustine hath sayd,August-contr. liter. Petil. li. 3. cap. 6. 
               Whether it be question of Christ, or whether it be question of his Church, or of what thing soeuer the question be; I say not if we, but if an Angell from heauen shall tell vs any thing beside that you haue receiued in the scripture vnder the Law and the Gospel,

In which place, the name of discipline importeth not as they who alleage it would faine haue it construed; but as any man who noteth the circumstance of the place, and the occasion of vttering the words, will easily acknowledge; euen the selfe same thing it signifieth which the name of doctrine doth, and as well might the one as the other there haue bene vsed.Hieron. contra Heluid. To helpe them farther, doth not Saint Ierome after the selfe same maner dispute, We beleeue it not because we reade it not? Yea, We ought not so much as to knowe the things which the booke of the Lawe containeth not,
               Hilar. in Psal. 132. sayth Saint Hilarie. Shall we hereupon then conclude that we may not take knowledge of, or giue credit vnto any thing, which sense or experience or report or art doth propose, vnlesse we find the same in scripture? No, it is too plaine that so farre to extend their speeches, is to wrest them against their true intent and meaning. To vrge any thing vpon the Church, requiring thereunto that religious assent of Christian beliefe, wherewith the words of the holy Prophets are receiued; to vrge any thing as part of that supernaturall and Celestially reuealed truth which God hath taught, and not to shewe it in Scripture, this did the auncient Fathers euermore thinke vnlawfull, impious, execrable. And thus as their speeches were meant, so by vs they must be restrained. As for those alleaged words of Cyprian,

               this we haue heard out of thy mouth, herein the perfection of all religion doth consist. This is the first commandement and the last: thing being written in the booke of life, is (as it were) an euerlasting lesson both to men and Angels. Let Christian religion reade this one word, and meditate vpon this commaundement, and out of this scripture it shall find the rules of all learning to haue sprung, and from hence to haue risen, and hither to returne, whatsoeuer the Ecclesiasticall discipline containeth; and that in all things it is vaine and bootelesse which charity confirmeth not. Was this a sentence (trow you) of so great force to proue that Scripture is the onely rule of all the actions of men? Might they not hereby euen as well proue, that one commandement of Scripture is the onely rule of all things, and so exclude the rest of the Scripture, as now they do all meanes besides Scripture? But thus it fareth when too much desire of contradiction causeth our speech rather to passe by number, then to stay for waight. Well, but Tertullian doth in this case speake yet more plainely:
                  Tertul. lib▪ de Monog. T. C. l. 2. p. 81. And in another place Tertullian sayth, that the scripture denieth that which it noteth not. 
               The scripture
               ▪ sayth he, denieth what it noteth not: which are indeed the words of Tertullian. But what? the scripture reckoneth vp the Kings of Israell, and amongst those Kings Dauid: the scripture reckoneth vp the sonnes of Dauid, and amongst those sonnes Salomon. To proue that amongst the Kings of Israell there was no Dauid but only one, no Salomon but one in the sonnes of Dauid, Tertullians argument will fitly proue. For in as much as the scripture did propose to recken vp all, if there were moe it would haue named them. In this case the scripture doth deny the thing it noteth not. Howbeit I could not but thinke that man to do me some peece of manifest iniury, which would hereby fasten vpon me a generall opinion, as if I did thinke the scripture to deny the very raigne of King Henry the eight, because it no where noteth that any such King did raigne. Tertullians speech is probable concerning such matter as he there speaketh of. There was, saith Tertullian, no second Lamech like to him that had two wiues; the scripture denieth what it noteth not. As therefore it noteth one such to haue bene in that age of the world; so had there beene moe, it would by likelihood as well haue noted many as one. What infer we now hereupon? There was no second Lamech; the scripture denieth what it noteth not. Were it consonant vnto reason to diuorce these two sentences, the former of which doth shew how the later is restrained; and not marking the former, to conclude by the later of them, that simply whatsoeuer any man at this day doth thinke true, is by the scripture denied, vnlesse it be there affirmed to be true? I wonder that a cause so weake and feeble hath bene so much persisted in. But to come vnto those their sentences wherein matters of action are more apparantly touched; the name of Tertullian is as before,

And that in indifferent things it is not enough that they be not against the word, but that they be according to the word, it may appeare by other places, where he sayth, that whatsoeuer, pleaseth, not the Lord, displeaseth him, and with hurt is receiued. lib. 2. ad vxorem. so here againe pretended; who writing vnto his wife two bookes, and exhorting her in the one to liue a widdow, in case God before her should take him vnto his mercy; and in the other, if she did marry, yet not to ioyne her selfe to

And because in defence it might perhaps be replied, seeing God doth will that couples which are maried when bothe are infidels, if either party chaunce to be after conuerted vnto Christianity, this should not make separation betweene them, as long as the vnconuerted was willing to reteine the other on whom the grace of Christ had shined; wherefore then should that let the making of mariage, which doth not dissolue mariage being made? after great reasons shewed why God doth in Conuerts being maried allow continuance with infidels, and yet disallow that the faithfull when they are free should enter into bonds of wedlocke with such, concludeth in the end concerning those women that so mary, They that please not the Lord, do euen thereby offend the Lord,

                an offer of themselues into the seruice of that enemy with whose seruants they linke themselues in so neere a bond. What one syllable is there in all this, preiudiciall any way to that which we hold? For the words of Tertullian as they are by them alleaged, are two wayes misunderstood; both in the former part, where that is extended generally to all things in the neuter gender, which he speaketh in the feminine gender of womens persons; and in the later, where receiued with hurt, is put in stead of wilfull incurring that which is euill. And so in summe Tertullian doth neither meane nor say as is pretended, Whatsoeuer pleaseth not the Lord displeaseth him, and with hurt is receiued; but Those women that please not the Lord by their kind of marying, do euen thereby offend the Lord, they do euen thereby throw themselues into euill. Somewhat more shew there is in a second place of Tertullian, which notwithstanding, when we haue examined it, will be found as the rest are. The Romaine Emperours custome was at certaine solemne times to bestowe on his souldiers a Donatiue;T. C. l. 2. p. 81. which Donatiue they receiued,And to come yet neerer, Where he disputeth against the wearing of crowne or garland, (which is indifferent of it selfe) to those which obiecting asked, where the scripture saith that a man might not weare a crowne; he answereth by asking where the scripture sayth that they may weare? And vnto them replying that it is permitted which is not forbidden; he answereth, that it is forbidden which is not permitted. Whereby appeareth, that the argument of the scriptures negatiuely holdeth, not onely in the doctrine and ecclesiasticall discipline, but euen in matters arbitrary and variable by the aduise of the Church. Where it is not inough that they be not forbidden, vnlesse there be some word which doth permit the vse of them: it is not enough that the scripture speaketh not against them, vnlesse it speake for them: and finally where it displeaseth the Lord which pleaseth him not, we must of necessitie haue the word of his mouth to declare his pleasure. wearing garlands vpon their heads. There were in the time of the Emperors Seuerus and Antoninus, many who being souldiers, had bene conuerted vnto Christ, and notwithstanding continued still in that militarie course of life. In which number, one man there was amongst all the rest, who at such a time comming to the Tribune of the army to receiue his Donatiue, came but with a garland in his hand, and not in such sort as others did. The Tribune offended hereat demaundeth, what this great singularitie should meane. To whom the souldier, Christianus sum, I am a Christian. Many there were so besides him, which yet did otherwise at that time; whereupon grew a question, whether a Christian souldier might herein do as the vnchristian did, and

               s they wore. Many of them which were very sound in Christian beliefe, did rather commend the zeale of this man, then approue his action. Tertullian was at the same time a Montanist, and an enemy vnto the Church for condemning that propheticall Spirite, which Monta
                     ••
                  s and his followers did boast they had receiued; as if in them Christ had performed his last promise; as if to them he had sent the Spirit that should be their perfecter and finall instructer in the mysteries of Christian truth. Which exulceration of mind made him apt to take all occasions of contradiction. Wherefore in honour of that action, and to gall their minds who did not so much commend it, he wrote his booke De corona militis, not dissembling the stomacke wherewith he wrote it. For first the man he commendeth as one more constant then the rest of his brethren, Who presumed, sayth he, that they might well enough serue two Lords.
               Tert. de corona militis. Afterwards choller somewhat more rising within him, he addeth, It doth euen remaine that they should also deuise how to rid themselues of his martyrdomes, towards the prophecies of whose holy spirit they haue already shewed their disdaine. They mutter that their good and long peace is now in hazard. I doubt not but some of them send the Scriptures before, trusse vp bagge and baggage, make themselues in a readinesse, that they may flye from Citie to Citie. For that is the only point of the Gospell which they are carefull not to forget. I knowe euen their Pastors very well what men they are, in peace Lions, Harts in time of trouble and feare. Now these men, saith Tertullian, They must be aunswered where we do find it written in Scripture that a Christian man may not weare a garland. And as mens speeches vttered in heate of distempered affection, haue often times much more egernes then waight; 
                  •
               o he that shall marke the proofes alleaged, and the answers to things obiected in the booke, will now and then perhaps espie the like imbecillity. Such is that argument whereby they that wore on their heads garlands, are charged as transgressors of natures lawe, and guilty of sacrilege against God the Lord of nature, in as much as flowers in such sort worne, can neither be smelt nor seene well by those that weare them▪ and God made flowers sweet and beautifull, that being seene and smelt vnto, they might so delight. Neither doth Tertullian bewray this weaknes in striking only, but also in repelling their strokes with whom he contendeth. They aske sayth he, What scripture is there which doth teach that we should not be crowned? And what scripture is there which doth teach that we should? For in requiring on the contrary part the aide of scripture, they do giue sentence before hand that their part ought also by scripture to be aided. Which answer is of no great force. There is no necessitie, that if I confesse I ought not to do that which the scripture forbiddeth me, I should thereby acknowledge my selfe bound to do nothing which the Scripture commandeth me not. For many inducements besides Scripture may leade me to that, which if scripture be against, they all giue place, and are of no value▪ yet otherwise are strong and effectuall to perswade. VVhich thing himselfe well enough vnderstanding, and being not ignorant that Scripture in many things doth neither commaund nor forbid, but vse silence; his resolution in fine is; that in the Church a number of things are strictly obserued▪ whereof no law of scripture maketh mention one way or other; that of things once receiued and confirmed by vse, long vsage is a law sufficient; that in ciuill affaires when there is no other law▪ custome it selfe doth stand for lawe; that in as much as law doth

stand vpon reason, to alleage reason serueth as well as to cite scripture; that whatsoeuer is reasonable, the same is lawfull whosoeuer is author of it; that the authoritie of Custome is great; finally that the custome of Christians was then and had bene a long time not to weare garlands, and therefore that vndoubtedly they did offend, who presumed to violate such a custome by not obseruing that thing, the very inueterate obseruation whereof was a law sufficient to bind all men to obserue it, vnlesse they could shew some higher law, some law of scripture to the cōtrary. This presupposed, it may stand then very well with strength and soundnesse of reason, euen thus to answer; Whereas they aske what scripture forbiddeth them to weare a garland, we are in this case rather to demaund what scripture commandeth them. They cannot here alleage that it is permitted which is not forbidden them: no, that is forbidden them which is not permitted. For long receiued Custome forbidding them to do as they did (if so be it did forbid them) there was no excuse in the world to iustifie their act, vnlesse in the scripture they could shewe some lawe, that did licence them thus to breake a receiued custome. Now whereas in all the bookes of Tertullian besides, there is not so much found as in that one, to proue not onely that we may do, but that we ought to do sundry things which the Scripture commaundeth not; out of that verie booke these sentences are brought to make vs belieue that Tertullian was of a cleane contrary minde. We cannot therefore hereupon yeeld, we cannot graunt, that hereby is made manifest the argument of Scripture negatiuely to be of force, not only in doctrine and ecclesiasticall discipline, but euen in matters arbitrary. For Tertullian doth plainely hold euen in that booke, that neither the matter which he intreateth of was arbitrary but necessarie, in as much as the receaued custome of the Church did tye and bind them not to weare garlands as the Heathens did; yea and further also he reckoneth vp particularly a number of things, whereof he expresly concludeth; Harum & aliarum eiusmodi disciplinarum si legem expostules scripturarum, nullam inuenies; which is as much as if he had sayd in expresse words, Many things there are which concerne the discipline of the Church and the duties of men, which to abrogate and take away, the scriptures negatiuely vrged may not in any case perswade vs, but they must be obserued, yea although no scripture be found which requireth any such thing. Tertullian therefore vndoubtedly doth not in this booke shew himselfe to be of the same mind with them by whom his name is pretended.
            6 But sith the sacred scriptures themselues affoord oftentimes such arguments as are taken from diuine authoritie both one way and other,The first assertion endeuoured to be confirmed by the scriptures custome of disputing frō diuine authority negatiuely. 1. Iohn. 2.5▪ God is light, and there is in him no darknesse at all. Hebr. 6.18. It is imposble that God should lye. Num. 23.19. God is not as man that he should lye. 
               The Lord hath commaunded, therefore it must be; And againe in like sort, He hath not, therefore it must not be; some certainty concerning this point seemeth requisite to be set downe. God himselfe can neither possibly erre, nor leade into error. For this cause his testimonies, whatsoeuer he affirmeth, are alwaies truth and most infallible certainty. Yea further, because the things that proceed frō him are perfect without any manner of defect or maime; it cannot be but that the words of his mouth are absolute, & lacke nothing which they should haue, for performance of that thing whereunto they tend. Wherupon it followeth, that the end being knowne wherunto he directeth his speech, the argumēt euen negatiuely is euermore strōg & forcible, cōcerning those things that are apparātly requisit vnto the

same ende. As for example,

                     •
                  ment to the contrary (as in the former there was▪ Leuit. 18.21. & 20.3. Deut. 17.16.) In Iosua the children of Israel are charged by the Prophet that they asked not counsell of the

                   mouth of the Lord when they entered into couenant with the Gabeonites, Iosh. 9.14. And yet that couenant was not made contrarie vnto anie commaundement of God. Moreouer we reade that when Dauid had taken this counsell to build a temple vnto the Lord, albeit the Lord had reuealed before in his word that there should be such a standing place▪ where the Arke of the couenant and the seruice should haue a certaine abiding▪ and albeit there was no word of God which 
                     •
                  orbad Dauid to build the Temple: yet the Lord (with commendation of his good affection and zeale hee had to the aduancement of his glorie) concludeth against Dauid
                     •
                   resolution to build the Temple, with this reason▪ namely that he had giuen no commandement of this who should build it. 1. Chr. 17.6.
                God intending to set downe sundry times that which in Angels is most excellent, hath not any where spoken so highly of them as he hath of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ; therefore they are not in dignitie equall vnto him. It is the Apostle Saint Paules argument. The purpose of God was to teach his people, both vnto whom they should offer sacrifice▪ and what sacrifice was to be offered. To burne their sonnes in fire vnto Baal hee did not commaund them, he spake no such thing▪ neither came it into his mind: therefore this they ought not to haue done. VVhich argument the Prophet Ieremie vseth more then once, as being so effectuall and strong, that although the thing hee reproueth were not onely not commaunded but forbidden them, and that expresly;Leuit. 18.21. & 20.3. Deut. 28.10. yet the Prophet chooseth rather to charge them with the fault of making a lawe vnto themselues, then with the crime of transgressing a lawe which God had made. For when the Lord hath once himselfe precisely set downe a forme of executing that wherein we are to serue him, the fault appeareth greater to do that which we are not, then not to do that which we are commaunded. In this we seeme to charge the Lawe of God with hardnesse onely▪ in that with foolishnesse; in this we shew our selues weake and vnapt to be doers of his will, in that we take vpon vs to be controllers of his wisedome; in this we faile to performe the thing which God seeth meete, conuenient and good, in that we presume to see what is meete and conuenient better then God himselfe. In those actions therefore the whole forme whereof God hath of purpose set downe to be obserued, we may not otherwise do then exactly as he hath prescribed; in such things negatiue arguments are strong. Againe, with a negatiue argument Dauid is pressed concerning the purpose he had to build a Temple vnto the Lord; Thus sayth the Lord, thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in.1. Chro. 17, 
                        •
                     . Wheresoeuer I haue walked with all Israell, spake I one word to any of the Iudges of Israel, whom I commaunded to feed my people, saying▪ Why haue ye not built me an house? The Iewes vrged with a negatiue argument touching the ayde which they sought at the hands of the King of AEgypt, Woe to those rebellious children (sayth the Lord) which walke forth to go downe into AEgypt,
               Esay. 30.1 
               and haue not asked counsell at my mouth, to strengthen themselues with the strength of Pharao. Finally, the league of Ioshua with the Gabeonites is likewise with a negatiue argument touched. It was not as it should be: And why? The Lord gaue them not that aduise; They sought not counsell at the mouth of the Lord. By the vertue of which examples▪
               Iosh. 9.14. if any man should suppose the force of negatiue arguments approued, when they are taken from Scripture in such sort as we in this question are pressed therewith, they greatly deceiue themselues. For vnto which of all

these was it said, that they had done amisse in purposing to do, or in doing any thing at all which the Scripture commanded them not? Our question is, whether all be sinne which is done without direction by scripture, and not whether the Israelites did at any time amisse by following their owne minds, without asking counsell of God. No, it was that peoples singular priuiledge, a fauour which God vouchfafed them aboue the rest of the world, that in the affaires of their estate, which were not determinable one way or other by the scripture, himselfe gaue them extraordinarily direction and counsell as oft as they sought it at his hands. Thus God did first by speech vnto Moses; after by Vrim and Thummim vnto Priests; lastly by dreames and visions vnto Prophets, from whom in such cases they were to receiue the aunswere of God. Concerning Iosua therefore thus spake the Lord vnto Moses saying,Num. 27.21. 
               He shall stand before Eleazar the Priest, who shall aske counsell for him by the iudgement of Vrim before the Lord: whereof had Iosua bene mindfull, the fraud of the Gabeonites could not so smoothly haue past vnespied till there was no helpe. The Iewes had Prophets to haue resolued them from the mouth of God himselfe, whether Egyptian aides should profite them yea or no: but they thought themselues wise enough, and him vnworthy to be of their Counsell. In this respect therfore was their reproofe, though sharpe, yet iust, albeit there had bene no charge precisely geuen them that they should alwayes take heed of Egypt. But as for Dauid, to thinke that he did euill in determining to build God a Temple, because there was in scripture no commandement that he should build it, were very iniurious: the purpose of his hart was religious and godly,1. Chron. 17. the act most worthy of honour and renowne; neither could Nathan choose but admire his vertuous intent, exhort him to go forward, and beseech God to prosper him therein. But God saw the endlesse troubles which Dauid should be subiect vnto during the whole time of his regiment, and therefore gaue charge to differre so good a worke till the dayes of tranquilitie and peace, wherein it might without interruption be performed. Dauid supposed that it could not stand with the duty which he owed vnto God, to set himselfe in an house of Cedar trees, and to behold the Arke of the Lords Couenant vnsetled. This opinion the Lord abateth, by causing Nathan to shew him plainely, that it should be no more imputed vnto him for a fault, then it had bene vnto the Iudges of Israell before him, his case being the same which theirs was, their times not more vnquiet then his, nor more vnfit for such an action.

               and by many of the Catholique Fathers. Saint Paule saith, God said not vnto Abraham, In thy seeds all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, but in thy seed which is Christ, and thereof he thought he made a good argument. Likewise sayth Origen, The bread which the Lord gaue vnto his disciples, saying vnto them, Take and eate, he differred not,

This kind of proofe is thought to hold in Gods commaundements, for that they be full and perfect, and God hath specially charged vs, that we should neither put to them, nor take fro them: and therefore it seemeth good vnto them that haue learned of Christ, Vnus est magister vester Christus, & haue heard the voyce of God the Father from heauen,

The Bishops defence in this case is, The auncient learned Fathers hauing to deale with impudent heretiques, that in defence of their errors auouched the iudgement of all the old Bishops and Doctors that had bene before them, and the generall consent of the primitiue and whole vniuersall Church, and that with as good regard of truth, and as faithfully as you do now; the better to discouer the shamelesse boldnes & nakednes of their doctrine, were oftentimes likewise forced to vse the negatiue, & so to driue the same heretiques as we do you, to proue their affirmatiues, which thing to do it was neuer possible. The ancient father Irenaeus thus stayed himselfe, as we do by the negatiue, Hoc neque Prophetae praedicauerunt, néque Dominus docuit, néque Apostoli tradiderunt,
               Lib. 1. cap. 1

               This thing neither did the Prophets publish, nor our Lord teach, nor the Apostles deliuer. By a like negatiue Chrysostome saith, This tree neither Paule planted,
               De incomp. nat. Dei hom. 3. 
               nor Apollo watered, nor God increased. In like sort Leo saith, What needeth it to beleeue that thing that neither the Lawe hath taught, nor the Prophets haue spoken,

Augustine hauing reekoned vp a great number of the Bishops of Rome, by a generall negatiue saith thus, In all this order of succession of Bishops,

               there is not one Bishop found that was a Donatist▪ Saint Gregory being himselfe a Bishop of Rome, and writing against the title of vniuersall Bishop, saith thus, None of all my predecessors euer consented to vse this vngodly title, No Bishop of Rome euer tooke vpon him this name of Singularity. By such negatiues, M. Harding, we reproue the vanity and nouelty of your religion; we tell you none of the catholique ancient learned Fathers either Greeke or Latine euer vsed either your priuate Masse, or your halfe communion, or your barbarous vnknowne prayers. Paule neuer planted them, Apollo neuer watered them, God neuer increased them, they are of your selues, they are not of God. In all this there is not a syllable which any way crosseth vs. For cōcerning arguments negatiue euen taken from humane authority

               , they are here proued to be in some cases very strong and forcible. They are not in our estimation idle reproofes, when the authors of needlesse innouations are opposed with such negatiues, as that of Leo, How are

these new deuises brought in which our fathers neuer knew? When their graue and reuerend superiours do recken vp vnto them, as Augustine did vnto the Donatists, large Catalogues of Fathers wondered at for their wisdome, piety, and learning, amongst whom for so many ages before vs, no one did euer so thinke of the Churches affaires, as now the world doth begin to be perswaded; surely by vs they are not taught to take exception hereat, because such arguments are negatiue. Much lesse when the like are taken from the sacred authority of Scripture, if the matter it selfe do beare them. For in truth the question is not, whether an argument from scripture negatiuely may be good, but whether it be so generally good, that in all actions men may vrge it. The fathers I graunt do vse very generall and large tearmes, euen as Hiero the King did in speaking of Archimedes, From henceforward whatsoeuer Archimedes speaketh, it must be belieued. His meaning was not that Archimedes could simply in nothing be deceiued, but that he had in such sort approued his skill, that he seemed worthy of credit for euer after in matters appertaining vnto the science he was skilfull in. In speaking thus largely it is presumed, that mens speeches will be taken according to the matter whereof they speake. Let any man therefore that carieth indifferency of iudgement, peruse the Bishops speeches, and consider well of those negatiues concerning scripture, which he produceth out of Irenaeus, Chrysostome, & Leo; which three are chosen from amongst the residue, because the sentences of the others (euen as one of theirs also) do make for defence of negatiue arguments taken from humane authority,Their opinion cōcerning the force of arguments taken from humane authority for the ordering of mens actiō

                   or perswasiōs. and not from diuine onely. They mention no more restraint in the one then in the other: yet I thinke themselues will not hereby iudge, that the Fathers tooke both to be strong, without restraint vnto any speciall kind of matter wherein they held such arguments forcible. Nor doth the Bishop either say or proue any more, then that an argument in some kinds of matter may be good, although taken negatiuely from Scripture.
            
               
                  T. C. l. 1. p. 25. When the question is of the authority of a man, it holdeth neither affirmatiuely nor negatiuely. The reason is, because the infirmitie of man can neither attaine to the perfection of any thing whereby he might speake all things that are to be spoken of it; neither yet be free from error in those things which he speaketh or giueth out. And therefore this argument neither affirmatiuely nor negatiuely compelleth the hearer, but only induceth him to some liking or disliking of that for which it is brought, and is rather for an Orator to perswade the simpler sort, then for a disputer to enforce him that is learned.7 An earnest desire to draw all things vnto the determination of bare and naked Scripture, hath caused here much paines to be taken in abating the estimation and credite of man. Which if we labour to maintaine as farre as truth and reason will beare, let not any thinke that we trauaile about a matter not greatly needful. For the scope of all their pleading against mans authoritie is, to ouerthrowe such orders, lawes, and constitutions in the Church, as depending thereupon if they should therefore be taken away, would peradueture leaue neither face nor memory of Church to continue long in the world, the world especially being such as now it is. That which they haue in this case spoken, I would for breuities sake let passe, but that the drift of their speech being so dangerous, their words are not to be neglected. Wherefore to say that simply an argument taken from mans authority doth hold no way, neither affirmatiuely nor negatiuely, is hard. By a mans authority we here vnderstād, the force which his word hath for the assurance of anothers mind that buildeth vpon it; as the Apostle somewhat did vpon their report of the house of Cloe,
               1. Cor. 1.11. and the Samaritanes in a matter of farre greater moment vpon the report of a simple woman.

For so it is sayd in Saint Iohns Gospell,Iohn. 4.35. 
               Many of the Samaritans of that City belieued in him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He hath told me all things that euer▪ I did. The strength of mans authority is affirmatiuely such, that the waightiest affaires in the world depend ther
                  •
               on. In iudgement and iustice are not herevpon proceedings grounded?Deut. 19.15. Sayth not the law that in the mouth of two or three witnesses euery word shalbe confirmed? This the law of God would not say,Mat. 18.16. if there were in a mans testimony no force at all to prooue any thing. And if it be admitted that in matter of fact there is some credite to be giuen to the testimonie of man, but not in matter of opinion and iudgement; we see the contrary both acknowledged and vniuersally practised also throughout the world. The sentences of wise and expert men were neuer but highly esteemed. Let the title of a mans right be called in question; are we not bold to relie and build vpon the iudgement of such as are famous for their skill in the lawes of this land? In matter of state, the waight many times of some one mans authority is thought reason sufficient, euen to sway ouer whole nations. And this not onely with the simpler sort; but the learneder and wiser we are, the more such arguments in some cases preuaile with vs. The reason why the simpler sort are mooued with authority, is the conscience of their owne ignorance; whereby it commeth to passe, that hauing learned men in admiration, they rather feare to dislike them, then know wherefore they should allow and follow their iudgements. Contrariwise with them that are skilfull, authority is much more strong and forcible; because they only are able to discerne how iust cause there is, why to some mens authority so much should be attributed. For which cause the name of Hippocrates (no doubt) were more effectuall to perswade euen such men as Galen himselfe, then to moue a silly Empiricke. So that the very selfe same argument in this kind which doth but induce the vulga
                  •
                sort to like, may constraine the wiser to yeeld. And therefore not Orators only with the people, but euen the very profoundest disputers in all faculties haue hereby often with the best learned preuailed most. As for arguments taken from humaine authority and that negatiuely; for example sake, if we should thinke the assembling of the people of God together by the sound of a bell, the presenting of infants at the holy font by such as commonly we call their Godfathers, or any other the like receiued custome to be impious, because some men of whom we thinke very reuerendly, haue in their bookes and writings no where mentioned nor taught that such things should be in the Church; this reasoning were subiect vnto iust reproofe, it were but feeble, weake and vnsound. Notwithstanding euen negatiuely an argument from humaine authority may be strong, as namely thus; The Chronicles of England mention no moe then onely sixe kings bearing the name of Edward, since the time of the last conquest; therefore it cannot be there should be moe. So that if the question be of the authority of a mans testimony, we cannot simply auouch, either that affirmatiuely it doth not any way hold, or that it hath only force to induce the simpler sort, and not to constraine men of vnderstanding and ripe iudgement to yeeld assent, or that negatiuely it hath in it no strength at all. For vnto e
                  •
               uery of these the contrary is most plaine. Neither doth that which is alleaged concerning the infirmitie of men, ouerthrow or disproue this. Men are blinded with ignorance and errour; many things may

escape them, and in many things they may bee deceiued; yea those things which they do knowe, they may either forget, or vpon sundry indirect considerations let passe; and although themselues do not erre, yet may they through malice or vanity, euen of purpose deceiue others. Howbeit infinite cases there are wherein all these impediments and lets are so manifestly excluded, that there is no shew or colour whereby any such exception may be taken, but that the testimony of man will stand as a ground of infallible assurance. That there is a City of Rome, that Pius Quintus and Gregory the 13. and others haue beene Popes of Rome, I suppose we are certainely enough perswaded. The ground of our perswasion, who neuer saw the place nor persons before named, can be nothing but mans testimony. Will any man here notwithstanding alleage those mentioned humaine infirmities, as reasons why these things should be mistrusted or doubted of? Yea that which is more, vtterly to infringe the force and strength of mans testimony, were to shake the very fortresse of Gods truth. For whatsoeuer we beleeue concerning saluation by Christ, although the scripture be therein the ground of our beliefe; yet the authority of man is if we marke it the key, which openeth the dore of entrance into the knowledge of the scripture. The scripture could not teach vs the things that are of God, vnlesse we did credite men who haue taught vs that the words of Scripture do signifie those things. Some way therefore, notwithstanding mans infirmitie, yet his authority may enforce assent.
                  T. C. l. 1. p. 10. Although that kind of argument of authoritie of men is good, neither in humaine nor diuine sciences; yet it hath some small force in humaine sciences, for as much as naturally, & in that he is a man, he may come to some ripenes of iudgement in those sciences; which in diuine matters hath no force at all, as of him which naturally, and as he is a man, can no more iudge of them shew a blind man of colours. Yea so farre is it from drawing credit if it be barely spoken without reason and testimony of scripture, that it carieth also a suspition of vntruth whatsoeuer proceedeth from him, which the Apostle did well note when to signifie a thing corruptly spoken and against the truth, he saith, that it is spoken according vnto man. Rom. 3. He saith not as a wicked and lying man, but simply as a man. And although this corruption be reformed in many; yet for so much as in whome the knowledge of the truth is most aduanced, there remaineth both ignorance and disordered affections (whereof either of them turneth him from speaking of the truth;) no mans authority, with the Church especially, and those that are called and perswaded of the authority of the word of God, can bring any assurance vnto the conscience. Vpon better aduise and deliberation so much is perceiued, and at the length confest, that arguments taken from the authority of men may not onely so farre forth as hath bene declared, but further also be of some force in humaine sciences; which force be it neuer so smal, doth shew that they are not vtterly naught. But in matters diuine it is still maintained stifly, that they haue no manner force at all. Howbeit the very selfe same reasō, which causeth to yeeld that they are of some force in the one, will at the length constraine also to acknowledge, that they are not in the other altogether vnforcible. For if the naturall strength of mans wit may by experience and study attaine vnto such ripenes in the knowledge of things humaine, that men in this respect may presume to build somewhat vpon their iudgement; what reason haue we to thinke but that euen in matters diuine, the like wits furnisht with necessary helpes, exercised in scripture with like diligence, and assisted with the grace of almighty God, may growe vnto so much perfection of knowledge, that men shall haue iust cause, when any thing pertinent vnto faith and religion is doubted of, the more willingly to incline their mindes towards that which the sentence of so graue, wise, and learned in that faculty shal iudge most sound. For the controuersie is of the waight of such mens iudgements. Let it therefore be suspected, let it be taken as grosse, corrupt, repugnant vnto the truth, whatsoeuer concerning things diuine aboue

nature shall at any time be spoken as out of the mouthes of meere naturall men, which haue not the eyes wherwith heauenly thinges are discerned. For this we contend not. But whom God hath indued with principall giftes to aspire vnto knowledge by, whose exercises, labours, and diuine studies he hath so bles
                  •
               , that the world for their great and rare skill that way, hath them in singular admiration; may wee reiect euen their iudgement likewise, as being vtterly of no moment? For mine owne part I dare not so lightly esteeme of the Church, and of the principall pillars therein. The truth is, that the minde of man desireth euermore to knowe the truth according to the most infallible certaintie which the nature of thinges can yeeld. The greatest assurance generally with all men, is that which we haue by plaine aspect and intuitiue beholding. Where we cannot attaine vnto this; there what appeareth to bee true by strong and inuincible demonstration, such as wherein it is not by any way possible to be deceiued, thereunto the minde doth necessarily assent, neither is it in the choice thereof to do otherwise. And in case these bothe do faile; then which way greatest probabilitie leadeth, thither the mind doth euermore incline. Scripture with Christiā men being receiued as the word of God, that for which we haue probable, yea that which we haue necessary reason for, yea that which wee see with our eyes is not thought so sure, as that which the scripture of God teacheth; because wee hold that his speech reuealeth there what himselfe seeth, & therefore the strongest proofe of all, and the most necessarily assented vnto by vs (which do thus receiue the scripture,) is the scripture. Now it is not required or can bee exacted at our handes, that we should yeeld vnto any thing other assent, then such as doth answere the euidence which is to be had of that we assent vnto. For which cause euen in matters diuine, concerning some thinges we may lawfully doubt and suspend our iudgement, inclining neither to one side or other, as namely touching the time of the fall both of man and Angels; of some thinges we may very well retaine an opinion that they are probable & not vnlikely to be true, as whē we hold that men haue their soules rather by creation then propagation, or that the mother of our Lord liued alwaies in the state of virginitie as well after his birth as before (for of these two, the one her virginitie before, is a thing which of necessitie we must belieue; the other her continuance in the same state alwaies, hath more likelihood of truth then the contrary;) finally in all things then are our consciences best resolued, and in most agreeable sort vnto God and nature fe

               ed, when they are so farre perswaded as those groundes of perswasion which are to be had will beare. Which thing I doe so much the rather set downe, for that I see how a number of soules are, for want of right informatiō in this point, oftentimes grieuously vexed. When bare and vnbuilded conclusions are put into their mindes, they finding not themselues to haue therof any great certaintie, imagine that this proceedeth only from lacke of faith, and that the spirite of God doth not worke in them, as it doth in true beleeuers; by this meanes their hearts are much troubled, they fall into anguish & perplexitie: wheras the truth is, that how bold and confident soeuer we may be in words, when it commeth to the point of triall, such as the euidence is which the truth hath eyther in it selfe or through proofe, such is the hearts assent thereunto, neither can it bee stronger, being grounded as it should be. I grant that proofe deriued frō the authoritie

of mans iudgement, is not able to worke that assurance which doth grow by a stronger proofe; and therfore although ten thousand generall Councels would set downe one & the same definitiue sentence concerning any point of religion whatsoeuer, yet one demonstratiue reason alleaged, or one manifest testimonie cited from the mouth of God himself to the contrary, could not choose but ouerweigh them all; in as much as for them to haue bene deceiued, it is not impossible; it is, that demonstratiue reason or testimonie diuine should deceiue. Howbeit in defect of proofe infallible, because the minde doth rather follow probable perswasions, then approue the things that haue in them no likelihood of truth at all; surely if a question cōcerning matter of doctrine were proposed, and on the one side no kind of proofe appearing, there should on the other be alleaged and shewed that so a number of the learnedest diuines in the world haue euer thought; although it did not appeare what reason or what scripture led them to be of that iudgement, yet to their very bare iudgement somewhat a reasonable man would attribute, notwithstanding the common imbecilities which are incident into our nature. And whereas it is thought, that especially with the Church, and those that are called & perswaded of thauthority of the word of God, mans authoritie with them especially should not preuaile; it must & doth preuaile euen with them, yea with them especially as far as equitie requireth, & farther we maintain it not. For men to be tyed & led by authoritie, as it were with a kind of captiuity of iudgement,

                   simple rude man alleaging reason vnto companies of learned men) I will content my selfe at this time with two or three sentences. Irenaeus saith, whatsoeuer is to be shewed in the scripture, canne, bee shewed but out of the scriptures themselues▪ lib. 3

                   cap. 12. Ierome saith. No man be he neuer so holy or eloquent, hath any authoritie after the Apostles in Ps. 86. Augustine saith, that he will beleeue none, how godly and learned soeuer he be, vnlesse he confirme his sentence by the scriptures, or by some reason not contrary to them Epist. 18. And in another place, Heare this, the Lord saith, heare not this, Donatus saith, Rogatus saith, Vincentius saith, Hylarius saith, Ambrose saith, Augustine saith, but hearken to this the Lord saith, Epist. 48. And againe hauing to do with an Arrian, he affirmeth that neither he ought to bring forth the councell of Nice, nor the other the councell of Arimine, thereby to bring preiudice each to other; neither ought the Arrian to be holden by the authoritie of the one, nor himselfe by the authoritie of the other, but by the scriptures which are witnesses proper to neither, but common to both▪ matter with matter, cause with cause, reason with reason ought to be debated. contra Maxim. Arian. 3.14. ca. And in an other place against Petilian the Donatist he saith, Let not these wordes be heard betweene vs, I say, you say, let vs heare this, Thus saith the Lord. And by and by speaking of the scriptures he saith, There let vs seeke the Church, there let vs try the cause. De vnita. Eccles. cap. 3. Hereby it is manifest, that the argument of the authoritie of man affirmatiuely is nothing worth. and though there be reason to the contrary, not to listen vnto it, but to follow like beastes the first in the heard, they know not nor care not whether, this were brutish. Againe that authoritie of men should preuaile with men either against or aboue reason, is no part of our beliefe. Companies of learned men be they neuer so great and reuerend, are to yeeld vnto reason; the waight whereof is no whit preiudiced by the simplicitie of his person which doth alleage it, but being found to be sound and good, the bare opinion of men to the contrary, must of necessitie stoope and giue place. Irenaeus writing against Marcion, which held one God author of the old Testament, and another of the new, to proue that the Apostles preached the same God which was knowne before to the Iewes, hee copiously alleageth sundry their sermons and speeches vttered concerning that matter, and recorded in Scripture. And least any should be wearied with such store of allegations, in the ende hee concludeth. While we labour for these demonstrations out of Scripture, and doe summarily declare the thinges which many wayes haue beene spoken, bee contented quietly to heare, and doe not thinke my speech tedious: Quoniam ostensiones quae sunt in scripturis

non possunt ostendi nisi ex ipsis scripturis; Because demonstrations that are in scripture, may not otherwise be shewed, then by citing them out of the scriptures themselues where they are. Which wordes make so little vnto the purpose, that they seeme as it were offended at him which hath called them thus solemnely foorth to say nothing. And concerning the verdict of Ierome, If no man, be he neuer so well learned, haue after the Apostles any authoritie to publish new doctrine as from heauen, and to require the worldes assent as vnto truth receiued by propheticall reuelation; doth this preiudice the credite of learned mens iudgements in opening that truth, which by being conuersant in the Apostles writinges, they haue themselues from thence learned? Saint Augustine exhorteth not to heare men, but to hearken what God speaketh. His purpose is not (I thinke) that wee should stop our eares against his owne exhortation, and therefore hee cannot meane simply that audience should altogether bee denied vnto men; but eyther that if men speake one thing and God himselfe teach an other, then hee, not they to bee obeyed; or if they both speake the same thing, yet then also mans speech vnworthy of hearing, not simply, but in comparison of that which proceedeth from the mouth of God. Yea but wee doubt what the will of God is. Are wee in this case forbidden to heare what men of iudgement thinke it to be? If not, then this allegation also might very well haue beene spared. In that auncient strife which was betweene the Catholique fathers and Arrians, Donatistes, and others of like peruerse and frowarde disposition, as long as to fathers or Councells alleaged on the one side, the like by the contrarie side were opposed, impossible it was that euer the question should by this meane growe vnto any issue or ende. The scripture they both beleeued, the scripture they knew could not giue sentence on both sides, by scripture the controuersie betweene them was such as might be determined. In this case what madnesse was it with such kindes of proofes to nourish their contention, when there were such effectuall meanes to end all controuersie that was betweene them? Hereby therefore it doth not as yet appeare, that an argument of authoritie of man affirmatiuely is in matters diuine nothing worth. Which opinion being once inserted into the mindes of the vulgar sort, what it may growe vnto God knoweth. Thus much wee see, it hath alreadie made thousandes so headstrong euen in grosse and palpable errors, that a man whose capacitie will scarce serue him to vtter fiue wordes in sensible manner, blusheth not in any doubt concerning matter of scripture to think his owne bare Yea as good as the Nay of all the wise, graue, and learned iudgements that are in the whole world. Which insolencie must be represt, or it will be the very bane of Christian religion. Our Lordes Disciples marking what speech hee vttered vnto them, and at the same time calling to minde a common opinion held by the Scribes, betweene which opinion and the wordes of their Maister, it seemed vnto them that there was some contradiction, which they could not themselues aunswere with full satisfaction of their owne mindes; the doubt they propose to our Sauiour saying, Why then say the Scribes that Elias must first come? They knew that the Scribes did erre greatly▪
               Matth. 17.10. and that many waies euen in matters of their owne profession. They notwithstanding thought the iudgement of the very Scribes in matters diuine to bee of some value;

some probabilitie they thought there was that Elias should come, in as much as the Scribes said it. Now no truth can contradict any truth; desirous therefore they were to be taught, how bothe might stand together, that which they knew▪ could not be false, because Christ spake it; and this which to them did seeme true, onely because the Scribes had said it. For the scripture from whence the Scribes did gather it, was not then in their heads. Wee doe not finde that our Sauiour reprooued them of error, for thinking the iudgement of Scribes to be worth the obiecting, for esteeming it to be of any moment or value in matters concerning God. We cannot therefore be perswaded that the will of God is, we should so farre reiect the authoritie of men, as to recken it nothing. No, it may be a question, whether they that vrge vs vnto this, be themselues so perswaded indeede. Men do sometimes bewray that by deedes, which to confesse they are hardly drawne. Marke then if this be not generall with all men for the most part. When the iudgements of learned men are alleaged against them; what do they but eyther eleuate their credite, or oppose vnto them the iudgements of others as learned? Which thing doth argue that all men acknowledge in them some force and waight, for which they are loath the cause they maintaine should be so much weakened as their testimony is auaileable. Againe what reason is there why alleaging testimonies as proofes, men giue them some title of credite, honour, and estimation whom they alleage, vnlesse before hand it be sufficiently knowne who they are; what reason hereof but only a common in grafted perswasion, that in some men there may be found such qualities as are able to counteruaile those exceptions which might be taken against them, and that such mens authoritie is not lightly to be shaken off? Shall I adde further, that the force of arguments drawne from the authoritie of scripture it selfe, as scriptures commonly are alleaged, shall (being sifted) be found to depende vpon the strength of this so much despised and debased authoritie of man? Surely it doth, and that oftner then we are aware of. For although scripture be of God, and therefore the proofe which is taken from thence must needes be of all other most inuincible; yet this strength it hath not, vnlesse it auouch the selfe same thing for which it is brought. If there be eyther vndeniable apparance that so it doth, or reason such as cannot deceiue, then scripture-proofe (no doubt) in strength and value exceedeth all. But for the most part, euen such as are readiest to cite for one thing fiue hundred sentences of holy scripture; what warrant haue they, that any one of them doth meane the thing for which it is alleaged? Is not their surest ground most commonly, eyther some probable coniecture of their owne, or the iudgement of others taking those Scriptures as they doe? Which notwithstanding to meane otherwise then they take them, it is not still altogether imposible. So that now and then they ground themselues on humane authoritie, euen when they most pretend diuine. Thus it fareth euen cleane throughout the whole controuersie about that discipline which is so earnestly vrged and laboured for. Scriptures are plentifully alleaged to proue, that the whole Christian worlde for euer ought to embrace it. Hereupon men terme it The discipline of God. Howbeit examine, sift, and resolue their alleaged proofes, till you come to the very roote from whence they spring, the heart wherein their strength lyeth; and it shall clearely

appeare vnto any man of iudgement, that the most which can be inferred vpon such plentie of diuine testimonies is onely this, That some thinges which they maintaine, as far as some men can probably coniecture, doe seeme to haue bene out of scripture not absurdly gathered. Is this a warrant sufficient for any mans conscience to builde such proceedinges vpon,
                  T. C. l. 2.21. If at any time it happened vnto Augustine (as it did against the Donatists and others) to alleage the authority of the auncient Fathers which had bin before him; yet this was not done before he had laid a sure foundation of his cause in the scriptures, and that also being prouoked by the aduersaries of the truth, who bare themselues high of some counsell, or of some man of name that had fauoured that part. as haue beene and are put in vre for the stablishment of that cause? But to conclude, I would gladly vnderstand how it commeth to passe, that they which so peremptorily doe maintaine that humane authoritie is nothing worth, are in the cause which they fauour so carefull to haue the common sort of men perswaded, that the wisest, the godliest, and the best learned in all Christendome are that way giuen, seeing they iudge this to make nothing in the world for them. Againe how commeth it to passe, they cannot abide that authoritie should be alleaged on the other side, if there be no force at all in authorities on one side or other? Wherefore labour they to strip their aduersaries of such furniture as doth not helpe? Why take they such needlesse paines to furnish also their owne cause with the like? If it be voyd and to no purpose that the names of men are so frequent in their bookes; what did moue them to bring them in, or doth to suffer them there remaining? Ignorant I am not how this is salued, They do it not but after the truth made manifest first by reason or by scripture, they doe it not but to controule the enemies of the truth, who beare themselues bold vpon humane authority, making not for them but against them rather. Which answeres are nothing. For in what place or vpon what consideration soeuer it be they doe it, were it in their owne opinion of no force being done, they would vndoubtedly refraine to doe it.

                  ter. first it may not well be denied, that all actions of men endued with the vse of reason are generally eyther good or euill. For although it be granted that no action is properly tearmed good or euill, vnlesse it be voluntarie; yet this can be no let to our former assertion, that all actions of men indued with the vse of reason are generally either good or euill; because euen those thinges are done voluntarily by vs, which other creatures do naturally, in as much as wee might stay our doing of them if wee would. Beastes naturally doe take their foode and rest, when it offereth it selfe vnto them. If men did so too, and could not do otherwise of themselues; there were no place for any such reproofe as that of our Sauiour Christ vnto his disciples, could ye not watch with me one houre?
               Math. 26.40. That which is voluntarily performed in things tending to the end, if it be well done, must needes be done with deliberate consideration of some reasonable cause, wherefore wee rather should do it thē not. Wherupō it seemeth that in such actions only those are said to be good or euil, which are capable of deliberatiō: so yt many things being hourely done by men, wherein they need not vse with themselues any manner of consultation at all, it may perhaps hereby seeme that well or ill doing belongeth onely to our waightier affaires, and to those deeds which are of so great importance that they require aduise. But thus to determine were perilous, and peraduenture vnsound also. I do rather incline to thinke, that seeing all the vnforced actiōs of mē are volūtary; & al volūtary actiōs tēding to the end haue choice; & al choise presupposeth the knowledge of some cause wherfore we make it: wher

the reasonable cause of such actiōs so readily offereth it self, that it needeth not to be sought for; in those things though we do not deliberat, yet they are of their nature apt to be deliberated on, in regard of the wil which may encline either way, and would not any one way bend it self, if there were not some apparent motiue to lead it. Deliberatiō actuall we vse, when there is doubt what we should incline our willes vnto. Where no doubt is, deliberation is not excluded as impertinent vnto the thing, but as needlesse in regard of the agent, which seeth already what to resolue vpon. It hath no apparent absurditie therefore in it to thinke, that all actions of men indued with the vse of reason, are generally either good or euill. Whatsoeuer is good; the same is also approued of God: and according vnto the sundrie degrees of goodnesse, the kindes of diuine approbation are in like sort multiplyed. Some things are good, yet in so meane a degree of goodnesse, that men are only nor disproued nor disalowed of God for them. No man hateth his owne flesh. If ye doe good vnto them that doe so to you, the very Publicans themselues doe as much. They are worse then Infidels that haue no care to prouide for their owne.Ephes. 5.29. Matth. 5.46. 1. Tim. 5.8. In actions of this sorte, the very light of nature alone may discouer that which is so farre forth in the sight of God allowable. Some thinges in such sorte are allowed, that they be also required as necessary vnto saluation, by way of direct immediate and proper necessitie finall; so that without performance of them we cannot by ordinary course be saued, not by any means be excluded from life obseruing them. In actions of this kind, our chiefest direction is from scripture, for nature is no sufficient teacher what we should do that we may attaine vnto life euerlasting. The vnsufficiencie of the light of nature, is by the light of scripture so fully and so perfectly herein supplied, that further light then this hath added there doth not neede vnto that ende. Finally some thinges although not so required of necessitie, that to leaue them vndone excludeth from saluation, are notwithstanding of so great dignitie and acceptation with God, that most ample rewarde in heauen is laide vp for them. Hereof we haue no commandement either in nature or scripture which doth exact them at our handes:Matth. 10.42. yet those motiues there are in bothe, which drawe most effectually our mindes vnto them. In this kind there is not the least action but it doth somewhat make to the accessory augmentation of our blisse. For which cause our Sauiour doth plainely witnesse, that there shall not bee as much as a cup of colde water bestowed for his sake without reward. Herevpon dependeth whatsoeuer difference there is betweene the states of Saints in glory: hither we referre whatsoeuer belongeth vnto the highest perfection of man by way of seruice towards God:Act. 4.31. 1. Thes. 2.7.9. hereunto that feruor and first loue of Christians did bend it selfe, causing them to sell their possessions, and lay downe the price at the blessed Apostles feet: hereat S. Paul vndoubtedly did a

               me, in so far abridging his owne libertie, and exceeding that which the bond of necessarie and enioyned dutie tied him vnto. Wherfore seeing that in all these seuerall kindes of actions, there can be nothing possibly euill which God approueth; and that he approueth much more then he doth commaund; and that his very commandements in some kinde, as namely his precepts comprehended in the law of nature, may be otherwise known then onely by scripture; and that to do them, howsoeuer we know them, must needs▪ be acceptable in his sight▪ let them with whom we haue hitherto disputed consider

wel, how it can stand with reasō to make the bare mādate of sacred scripture the only rule of all good and euill in the actions of mortall men. The testimonies of God are true, the testimonies of God are perfect, the testimonies of God are all sufficient vnto that end for which they were giuen. Therfore accordingly we do receiue them; we do not think that in thē God hath omitted any thing needful vnto his purpose, & left his intent to be accomplished by our diuisings. What the scripture purposeth, the same in all points it doth performe. Howbeit, that here we swerue not in iudgement, one thing especially we must obserue, namely that the absolute perfection of scripture is seene by relatiō vnto that end wherto it tendeth. And euen hereby it commeth to passe, that first such as imagine the generall and maine drift of the body of sacred scripture not to be so large as it is▪ nor that God did thereby intend to deliuer, as in truth he doth, a full instruction in al things vnto saluatiō necessary, the knowledge wherof man by nature could not otherwise in this life attaine vnto: they are by this very mean induced, either still to looke for new reuelations from heauen, or else daungerously to ad to the word of God vncertaine tradition, that so the doctrine of mans saluation may be compleate, which doctrine we constantly hold in all respectes without any such thing added to be so cōpleat, that we vtterly refuse as much as once to acquaint our selues with any thing further. Whatsoeuer to make vp the doctrine of mans saluation is added, as in supply of the scriptures vnsufficiencie, we reiec
                  •
                it. Scripture purposing this, hath perfectly and fully done it. Againe the scope and purpose of God in deliuering the holy scripture, such as do take more largely thē behoueth, they on the contrary side racking & stretching it further thē by him was meant, are drawn into sundry as great incōueniences. These pretēding the scriptures perfection, inferre therupon, that in scripture all things lawfull to be done must needs be contained. We count those things perfect which want nothing requisite for the end wherto they were instituted. As therfore God created euery part and particle of man exactly perfect, that is to say▪ in all pointes sufficient vnto that vse for which he appointed it; so the scripture, yea euery sentence thereof is perfect, & wanteth nothing requisite vnto that purpose for which God deliuered the same. So that if hereupon wee conclude, that because the scripture is perfect, therfore all things lawful to be done are comprehended in the scripture▪ we may euen as wel conclude so of euery sentence, as of the whole sum and body therof, vnlesse we first of all proue that it was the drift,

But admit this, and marke▪ I beseech you, what would follow▪ God in deliuering scripture to his Church, should cleane haue abrogated amongst them the law of nature; which is an infallible knowledge imprinted in the mindes of all the children of men, whereby both generall principles f

                directing of humane actions are comprehended, and conclusions deriued from them; vpon which conclusions groweth in particularitie the choise of good and euill in the daily affaires of this life. Admit this; and what shall the scripture be but a snare and a torment to weake consciences, filling thē with infinite perplexities, scrupulosities, doubts insoluble, and extreame despaires? Not that the scripture it selfe doth cause any such thing, (for it tendeth to the cleane contrarie, and the fruite thereof is resolute assurance and certaintie in that it teacheth:) but the necessities

of this life vrging men to doe that which the light of nature, common discretion and iudgement of it selfe directeth them vnto▪ on the other side this doctrine teaching them that so to doe were to sinne against their owne soules, and that they put forth their hands to iniquitie, whatsoeuer they go about and haue not first the sacred scripture of God for direction; how can it choose but bring the simple a thousand times to their wits end; how can it choose but vexe and amaze them? For in euery action of commō life to find out some sentence clearly and infallibly setting before our eyes what wee ought to doe, (seeme wee in scripture neuer so expert) would trouble vs more then wee are aware. In weake and tender mindes wee little knowe what miserie this strict opinion would breede, besides the stoppes it would make in the whole course of all mens liues and actions. Make all thinges sinne which we doe by direction of natures light, & by the rule of common discretiō without thinking at all vpō scripture; admit this position, and parents shall cause their children to sinne, as oft as they cause them to do any thing, before they come to yeares of capacitie and be ripe for knowledge in the scripture. Admit this, and it shall not be with masters, as it was with him in the Gospell; but seruants being commaunded to goe shall stand still, till they haue their errand warranted vnto them by scripture. Which as it standeth with Christian dutie in some cases, so in common affaires to require it,Due. 7.8. were most vnfit. Two opinions therefore there are concerning sufficiencie of holy scripture, each extreamly opposite vnto the other, & bothe repugnant vnto truth. The schooles of Rome teach scripture to be so vnsufficient, as if, except traditions were added, it did not conteine all reuealed and supernaturall truth, which absolutely is necessary for the children of men in this life to know that they may in the next be saued. Others iustly condemning this opinion, growe likewise vnto a dangerous extremitie, as if scripture did not only containe all thinges in that kinde necessary, but all thinges simply, and in such sorte that to doe any thing according to any other lawe, were not onely vnnecessary, but euen opposite vnto saluation, vnlawfull and sinfull. Whatsoeuer is spoken of God, or thinges appertaining to God, otherwise then as the truth is; though it seeme an honour, it is an iniurie. And as incredible praises giuen vnto men, doe often abate and impaire the credit of their deserued commendation; so we must likewise take great heed, least in attributing vnto scripture more then it can haue, the incredibilitie of that do cause euen those thinges which indeed it hath most aboundantly, to be lesse reuerendly esteemed. I therefore leaue it to themselues to consider, whether they haue in this first point or not ouershot themselues; which God doth knowe is quickly done, euen when our meaning is most sincere, as I am verily perswaded theirs in this case was.
         
         
            
            The third Booke: Concerning their second assertion, that in Scripture there must be of necessitie contained a forme of Church-politie, the lawes whereof may in no wise be altered.
            
               The matter conteined in this third Booke.
               
                  1 
                        What the Church is, and in what respect lawes of politie are thereunto necessarily required.
                  
                  2 Whether it be necessary that some particular forme of Church-politie be set downe in scripture, sith the thinges that belong particularly to any such forme are not of necessitie to saluation.
                  
                  3 That matters of Church-politie are different from matters of faith and saluation, and that they themselues so teach which are our reprouers for so teaching.
                  
                  4 That hereby we take not from Scripture any thing which thereunto with soundnesse of truth may be giuen.
                  
                  5 Their meaning who first vrged against the politie of the Church of England, that nothing ought to be established in the Church more then is commaunded by the worde of God.
                  
                  6 How great iniurie men by so thinking should offer vnto all the Churches of God.
                  
                  7 A shift notwithstanding to maintaine it, by interpreting Commaunded as though it were meant that greater thinges only ought to be found set downe in Scripture particularly and lesser framed by the generall rules of Scripture.
                  
                  8 An other deuise to defend the same, by expounding Commaunded as if it did signifie grounded on Scripture, and were opposed to things found out by light of naturall reason onely.
                  
                  9 How lawes for the politie of the Church may be made by the aduise of men, and how those lawes being not repugnant to the word of God are approued in his sight.
                  
                  10 That neither Gods being the author of laws, nor yet his committing of them to Scripture, is any reason sufficient to proue that they admit no addition or change.
                  
                  11 Whether Christ must needs intend lawes vnchangeable altogether, or haue forbidden any where to make any other law then himselfe did deliuer.
                  
               
            
            
               ALbeit the substance of those controuersies whereinto wee haue begun to wade,What the Church is, and in what respect lawes of polity are thereunto necessarily required. be rather of outward things appertaining to the Church of Christ, then of any thing wherein the nature and being of the Church consisteth▪ yet because the subiect or matter which this position concerneth, is A forme of Church-gouernment or Church-politie; it therefore behoueth vs so far forth to consider the nature of the Church; as is requisite for mens more cleare and plaine vnderstanding, in what respect lawes of

politie or gouernment are necessary therunto. That Church of Christ which we properly terme his body mysticall, can be but one; neither can that one be sensibly discerned by any man, in as much as the parts thereof are some in heauen alreadie with Christ, and the rest that are on earth (albeit their naturall persons be visible) we do not discerne vnder this propertie whereby they are truly and infallibly of that body. Onely our mindes by intellectuall conceipt are able to apprehend, that such a reall body there is, a body collectiue, because it cōtaineth an huge multitude; a body mistical, because the mysterie of their coniunction is remoued altogether from sense. Whatsoeuer we read in scripture concerning the endlesse loue and the sauing mercie, which God sheweth towards his Church; the onely proper subiect thereof is this Church. Concerning this flocke it is that our Lord and Sauiour hath promised, I giue vnto them eternall life, and they shall neuer perish,
               Ioh. 10.28. 
               neither shall any plucke them out of my hands. They who are of this society, haue such markes and notes of distinction from all others, as are not obiect vnto our sense; onely vnto God, who seeth their hearts and vnderstandeth all their secret cogitations, vnto him they are cleare and manifest. All men knew Nathaniel to be an Israelite. But our Sauiour pearcing deeper, giueth further testimony of him then men could haue done with such certaintie as he did, Beholde indeede an Israelite in whom is no guile.
               Ioh. 1.47. Ioh. 21.15. If we professe as Peter did, that we loue the Lorde, and professe it in the hearing of men; charitie is prone to beleeue all thinges, and therefore charitable men are likely to thinke we do so, as long as they see no proofe to the contrary.1. Tim. 
                     •
                  .5. But that our loue is sound and sincere, that it commeth from a Pure heart and a good conscience & a faith vnfained, who can pronounce, sauing onely the searcher of all mens hearts, who alone intuitiuely doth knowe in this kinde who are his? And as those euerlasting promises of loue, mercy, & blessednes, belong to the mysticall church; euen so on the other side when we reade of any dutie which the Church of God is bound vnto, the Church whom this doth concerne is a sensibly knowne company. And this visible Church in like sorte is but one, continued from the first beginning of the world to the last end. Which company being deuided into two moieties; the one before, the other since the comming of Christ: that part which since the comming of Christ, partly hath embraced, and partly shall hereafter embrace the Christian Religion, wee terme as by a more proper name the Church of Christ. And therefore the Apostle affirmeth plainely of all men Christian, that be they Iewes or Gentiles, bond or free, they are al incorporated into one cōpany, they al make but Eph. 2.16. that he might reconcile bothe vnto God in one body. Eph. 3.16. that the Gentiles should be inheritors also and of the same body. Vide Th. p. 3. q. 7. ar. 3. 
               one body. The vnitie of which visible body and Church of Christ,1▪ Cor. 12.13. cōsisteth in that vniformitie, which all seuerall persons thereunto belonging haue, by reason of that One Lord, whose seruants they all professe themselues; that one faith, which they al acknowledge;Eph. 4.5. that one baptisme, wherewith they are all initiated. The visible Church of Iesus Christ is therefore one, in outward profession of those thinges, which supernaturally appertaine to the very essence of Christianitie, & are necessarily required in euery particular christiā man. Let all the house of Israel know for certaintie, saith Peter,Act. 2.36. Ioh. 13.13. 
               That God hath made him both Lorde and Christ, euen this Iesus whome ye haue crucified. Christiās therfore they are not, which cal not him their Master & Lord.Col. 3.24. Col. 4.1. And from hence it came, that first at Antioch, and afterwards throughout the whole world, all that were of the Church visible were called Christians, euen

amongst the Heathen: which name vnto them was precious and glorious; but in the estimation of the rest of the world, euen Christ Iesus himselfe was 1. Cor. 1.23. Vide & Tacitum lib. Annal. 15. Nero quaesitiss

This himselfe did foresee, and therefore armed his Church, to the end they might sustaine it without discomfort. All these thinges they will doe vnto you for my names sake; yea, the time shall come, that whosoeuer killeth you will thinke that he doth God good seruice. These thinges I tell you, that when the houre shall come, ye may then call to mind how I told you before hand of them. But our naming of Iesus Christ the Lorde,Ioh. 15.21. Ioh. 16.2.4. is not inough to proue vs Christiās, vnles we also imbrace that faith, which Christ hath published vnto the world. To shewe that the angell of Pergamus continued in Christianitie, behold, how the spirite of Christ speaketh, Thou keepest my name,
               Apoc. 2.13. Tertul. de. virgin. veland. 
               and thou hast not denied my faith. Concerning which faith, The rule thereof saith Tertullian is one alone, immoueable, and no way possible to be better framed a new. What rule that is hee sheweth by rehearsing those fewe articles of Christian beliefe. And before Tertullian, Ireney;Iren. aduers. haer. lib. 1. cap. 2. & 3. 
               The Church though scattered through the whole world vnto the vtmost borders of the earth, hath from the Apostles and their disciples receiued beleefe. The partes of which beleefe hee also reciteth in substance the very same with Tertullian, and thereupon inferreth; This faith the Church being spread farre and wide preserueth, as if one house did containe them; these thinges it equally embraceth, as though it had euen one soule, one heart, and no more; it publisheth, teacheth and deliuereth these thinges with vniforme consent, as if God had giuen it but one onely tongue wherewith to speake. Hee which amongst the guides of the Church is best able to speake, vttereth no more then this; and lesse then this the most simple doth not vtter, when they make profession of their faith. Now although wee know the Christian faith and allow of it, yet in this respect wee are but entring; entered wee are not into the visible Church, before our admittance by the doore of baptisme. Wherfore immediatly vpon the acknowledgement of christian faith,Act. 8.38. Act. 22.16. the Eunuch (we see) was baptized by Philip; Paule by Ananias;Act. 2.41. by Peter an huge multitude containing three thousand soules, which being once baptized, were reckoned in the number of soules added to the visible Church. As for those vertues that belong vnto morall righteousnesse and honestie of life, we doe not mention them, because they are not proper vnto Christian men, as they are Christian, but doe concerne them, as they are men. True it is, the want of these vertues excludeth from saluation. So doth much more the absence of inward beliefe of heart; so doth despaire and lacke of hope; so emptines of Christian loue and charitie. But wee speake now of the visible Church, whose children are signed with this marke, One Lord, one faith, one baptisme. In whomsoeuer these thinges are, the church doth acknowledge them for her children; them onely she holdeth for aliens and strangers, in whom these things are not found. For want of these it is that Saracens, Iewes, and Infidels, are excluded out of the bounds of the church. Others we may not denie to be of the visible church, as long as these thinges are not wanting in them. For apparent it is, that all men are of necessitie either Christians or not Christians. If by externall profession they be Christians, then

are they of the visible Church of Christ: And Christians by externall profession they are all, whose marke of recognisance hath in it those things which wee haue mentioned, yea although they be impious idolaters, wicked heretiques, persons excommunicable, yea and cast out for notorious improbitie. Such withall we denie not to be the imps and limmes of Satan, euen as long as they continue such. Is it then possible that the selfe same men should belong both to the synagogue of Satan, and to the Church of Iesus Christ? Vnto that Church which is his mysticall body, not possible; because that body consisteth of none but onely true Israelites, true sonnes of Abraham, true seruantes and Saints of God. Howbeit of the visible body and Church of Iesus Christ, those may be and oftentimes are, in respect of the maine partes of their outward profession; who in regard of their inward disposition of minde, yea of externall conuersation, yea euen of some parts of their very profession, are most worthily both hatefull in the sight of God himselfe, and in the eyes of the sounder partes of the visible Church most execrable.Matth. 13.47. Our Sauiour therefore compareth the kingdome of Heauen to a net,Math. 13.
                     •
                  4. whereunto all which commeth, neither is nor seemeth fish; his Church hee compareth vnto a fielde, where tares manifestly knowne and seene by all men doe growe intermingled with good corne, and euen so shall continue till the finall consummation of the world. God hath had euer, and euer shall haue, some church visible vpon earth. When the people of God worshipped the calfe in the wildernesse;Exod. 32. when they adored the brasen serpent;Psal. 106.19.20. when they serued the Gods of nations; when they bowed their knees to Baal;2. King. 18.4. when they burnt incense and offered sacrifice vnto Idoles;Ier. 11.13. true it is, the wrath of God was most fiercely inflamed against them,2. King. 22.17. their Prophetes iustly condemned them, as an adulterous seede and a wicked generation of miscreantes,Esa. 57.3. which had forsaken the liuing God,Esa. 1.4. Esa 60.15. and of him were likewise forsaken, in respect of that singular mercie wherewith hee kindly and louingly embraceth his faithfull children. Howbeit reteining the lawe of God,Ier. 13.11. and the holy seale of his couenant, the sheepe of his visible flocke they continued euen in the depth of their disobedience and rebellion.

                  . King. 19.18. Wherefore not onely amongst them God alwaies had his church, because hee had thousands which neuer bowed their knees to Baal; but whose knees were bowed vnto Baall, euen they were also of the visible church of God. Nor did the Prophet so complaine, as if that church had bene quite and cleane extinguished; but hee tooke it as though there had not bene remaining in the worlde any besides himselfe, that carried a true and an vpright heart towardes God, with care to serue him according vnto his holy will. For lacke of diligent obseruing the difference, first betweene the Church of God mysticall and visible, then betweene the visible sound and corrupted, sometimes more, sometimes lesse; the ouersightes are neither fewe nor light that haue beene committed. This deceiueth them, and nothing else, who thinke that in the time of the first worlde, the family of Noah did containe all that were of the visible Church of God. From hence it grewe and from no other cause in the world, that the Affricane Bishopes in the Councell of Carthage, knowing how the administration of Baptisme belongeth onelye to the Church of Christ,

and supposing that heretiques which were apparantly seuered from the sound beleeuing Church could not possibly be of the Church of Iesus Christ; thought it vtterly against reason, that baptisme administred by men of corrupt beleefe, should be accounted as a Sacrament▪ And therefore in maintenance of rebaptization their arguments are built vpon the forealeaged ground,Fortunat. in Concil. Car. Math. 7.24. 
               That heretiques are not at all any part of the Church of Christ. Our Sauiour founded his Church on a rocke, and not vpon heresie; power of baptizing he gaue to his Apostles,
               Math. 16.1
                     •
                  . 
               vnto heretiques he gaue it not. Wherefore they that are without the Church,
               Math. 28.19. 
               and oppose themselues against Christ, do but scatter his sheepe and flocke; without the Church baptize they cannot. Againe, Are heretiques Christians, or are they not? If they be Christians,
               Secundinus in eodem conci. 
               wherefore remaine they not in Gods Church? If they be no Christians, how make they Christians? Or to what purpose shall those words of the Lord serue, He which is not with me,
               Math. 12.30. 
               is against me; and, He which gathereth not with me▪ scattereth? Wherefore euident it is, that vpon misbegotten children and the brood of Antichrist, without rebaptization the holy Ghost cannot descend. But none in this case so earnest as Cyprian; I know no baptizme but one, and that in the Church only; none without the Church, where he that doth cast out the Diuell, hath the Diuell; he doth examine about beleefe, whose lips and words do breath foorth a canker; the faithlesse doth offer the articles of faith▪ a wicked creature forgiueth wickednesse, in the name of Christ Antichrist signeth, he which is cursed of God blesseth, a dead carrion promiseth life, a man vnpeaceable giueth peace, a blasphemer calleth vpō the name of God, a prophane person doth exercise priesthood, a sacrilegious wretch doth prepare the Altar, and in the necke of all these that euill also commeth, the Eucharist a very Bishop of the Diuell doth presume to consecrate. All this was true, but not sufficient to prooue that heretiques were in no sort any part of the visible Church of Christ, and consequently their baptisme no baptisme. This opinion therefore was afterwards both condemned by a better aduised councell,In Concilio Niceno vide Hierony. dial. aduers. Luciferia. and also reuoked by the chiefest of the authors thereof themselues. What is it but onely the selfe same error and misconceite, wherewith others being at this day likewise possest, they aske vs where our Church did lurke, in what caue of the earth it slept, for so many hundreds of yeeres together before the birth of Martin Luther▪
                As if we were of opinion that Luther did erect a new Church of Christ. No the Church of Christ which was from the beginning, is, and continueth vnto the end. Of which Church all parts haue not bene alwayes equally sincere & sound. In the dayes of Abia it plainely appeareth that Iuda was by many degrees▪ more free from pollution then Israell, as that solemne oration sheweth wherein he pleadeth for the one against the other in this wise:2. Chron. 1
                     •
                  . 
               O Ieroboam and all Israell heare you me▪ Haue ye not driuen away the Priests of the Lord, the sonnes of Aaron and the Leuits, and haue made you Priests like the people of nations? whosoeuer commeth to consecrate with a young bullocke and seuen Rammes, the same may be a Priest of them that are no Gods. But we belong vnto the Lord our God, and haue not forsaken him; and the Priests the sonnes of Aaron minister vnto the Lord euery morning and euery euening burnt offerings and sweete incense, and the bread is set in order vpon the pure table, and the candlesticke of gold with the lamps therof to burne euery euening; for we keepe the watch of the Lord our God, but ye haue forsaken him. In Saint Paules time the integritie of Rome was famous; Corinth many wayes reproued, they of Galatia much more out of square. In Saint Iohns time Ephesus and Smyrna in farre

better state then Thyatira and Pergamus were. We hope therefore that to reforme our selues, if at any time we haue done amisse, is not to seuer our selues from the Church we were of before. In the Church we were, and we are so still. Other difference betweene our estate before and now, we know none but onely such as we see in Iuda, which hauing some time beene idolatrous, became afterwards more soundly religious by renouncing idolatrie and superstition.Hos. 4.15. & 17. Ios. 24.15. 
               If Ephraim be ioyned vnto idoles, the counsell of the Prophet is, Let him alone. If Israell play the harlot, let not Iuda sinne. If it seeme euill vnto you sayth Iosua to serue the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serue, whether the Gods whom your fathers serued beyond the floud, or the Gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell; but I and mine house will serue the Lord. The indisposition therefore of the Church of Rome to reforme her selfe, must be no stay vnto vs from performing our duty to God; euen as desire of retaining conformity with them, could be no excuse if we did not performe that dutie. Notwithstanding so farre as lawfully we may, we haue held, and do hold fellowship with them. For euen as the Apostle doth say of Israell,Rom. 11.28. that they are in one respect enimies, but in another beloued of God: In like sort with Rome we dare not communicate concerning sundrie her grosse and grieuous abominations; yet touching those maine parts of Christian truth wherein they constantly still persist, we gladly acknowledge them to bee of the familie of Iesus Christ; and our hearty prayer vnto God almighty is, that being conioyned so farre foorth with them, they may at the length, (if it be his will) so yeeld to frame and reforme themselues, that no distraction remaine in any thing, but that we all may with one heart and one mouth, glorifie God the father of our Lord and Sauiour, whose Church we are. As there are which make the Church of Rome vtterly no Church at all, by reason of so many, so greeuous errors in their doctrines: so we haue them amongst vs, who vnder pretence of imagined corruptions in our discipline, do giue euen as hard a iudgement of the Church of England it selfe. But whatsoeuer either the one sort or the other teach, we must acknowledge euen heretikes themselues to be though a maimed part, yet a part of the visible Church. If an Infidell should pursue to death an heretique professing Christianitie, only for Christian profession sake: could we deny vnto him the honor of martyrdome? Yet this honor all men know to be proper vnto the Church. Heretikes therefore are not vtterly cut off from the visible Church of Christ. If the fathers do any where, as oftentimes they do, make the true visible Church of Christ and hereticall companies opposite, they are to be construed as separating heretikes not altogether from the company of beleeuers, but from the fellowship of sound beleeuers. For where profest vnbeleefe is, there can be no visible Church of Christ; there may be, where sound beliefe wanteth. Infidels being cleane without the Church, deny directly and vtterly reiect the very principles of Christianity; which heretikes embrace, and erre onely by misconstruction; whereupon their opinions although repugnant indeed to the principles of Christian faith, are notwithstanding by them held otherwise, and maintained as most consonant thereunto. Wherfore being Christians in regard of the generall truth of Christ which they openly professe; yet they are by the fathers euery where spokē of, as men cleane excluded out of the right belieuing

Church by reason of their particular errors, for which all that are of a sound beleefe must needes condemne them. In this consideration the aunswere of Caluin vnto Farell concerning the children of Popish parents doth seeme crased; Whereas sayth he, you aske our iudgement about a matter,
               Cal. Epist. 149. 
               whereof there is doubt amongst you, whether ministers of our order professing the pure doctrine of the Gospell, may lawfully admit vnto baptisme an infant whose father is a stranger vnto our Churches, and whose mother hath fallen from vs vnto the papacie, so that both the parents are popish; thus we haue thought good to aunswere, namely that it is an absurd thing for vs to baptise them, which cannot be reckoned members of our bodie. And sith Papists children are such, we see not how it should be lawfull to minister baptisme vnto them. Sounder a great deale is the aunswere of the Ecclesiasticall Colledge of Geneua vnto Knox, who hauing signified vnto them, that himselfe did not thinke it lawfull to baptize bastards or the children of idolaters (he meaneth Papists) or of parsons excommunicate, till either the parents had by repentance submitted themselues vnto the Church, or else their children being growne vnto the yeares of vnderstanding should come and sue for their owne baptisme: For thus thinking sayth he, I am thought to bee ouer seuere,
               Epist. 283. 
               and that not onely by them which are Popish, but euen in their iudgements also who thinke themselues maintainers of the truth. Maister Knoxes ouer-sight herein they controlled. Their sentence was,Epist. 285. 
               wheresoeuer the profession of Christianity hath not vtterly perished and beene exstinct, infants are beguiled of their right, if the common seale be denied them. Which conclusion in it selfe is sound, although it seemeth the ground is but weake whereupon they build it. For the reason which they yeeld of their sentence is this; The promise which God doth make to the faithfull concerning their seede, reacheth vnto a thousand generations; it resteth not onely in the first degree of descent. Infants therefore whose great graund fathers haue bene holy and godly, do in that respect belong to the bodie of the Church, although the fathers and graundfathers of whom they descend haue bene Apostates: Because the tenure of the grace of God which did adopt them three hundred years▪agoe and more in their auncient predecessors, cannot with iustice be defeated and broken off by their parents imp
                     •
                  etie comming betweene. By which reason of theirs, although it seeme that all the world may be baptised, in as much as no man liuing is a thousand descents remoued from Adam himselfe; yet we meane not at this time either to vphold or to ouerthrow it: onely their alleaged conclusion we embrace, so it be construed in this sort, That for as much as men remaine in the visible Church, till they vtterly renounce the profession of Christianity; we may not deny vnto infants their right by withholding from them the publike signe of holy baptisme, if they be borne where the outward acknowledgement of Christianity is not cleane gone and extinguished. For being in such sort borne, their parents are within the Church, and therefore their birth doth giue them interest and right in baptisme. Albeit not euerie error and fault, yet heresies and crimes which are not actually repented of and forsaken, exclude quite and cleane from that saluation, which belongeth vnto the misticall body of Christ; yea they also make a separation from the visible sound Church of Christ; altogether from the visible Church neither the one nor the other dothe seuer. As for the act of excommunication, it neither shutteth out from the misticall, nor cleane from the visible, but only from fellowship

with the visible in holy duties. With what congruity then doth the Church of Rome deny, that her enemies, whom she holdeth alwayes for heretikes, do at all appertaine to the Church of Christ; when her owne do freely grant, that albeit the Pope (as they say) cannot teach heresie nor propound error, he may notwithstanding himselfe worship idols, thinke amisse concerning matters of faith, yea giue himselfe vnto acts diabolicall, euen being Pope? How exclude they vs from being any part of the Church of Christ vnder the colour and pretence of heresie, when they cannot but graunt it possible euen for him to be as touching his owne personal perswasion hereticall, who in their opinion not only is of the Church, but holdeth the chiefest place of authority ouer the same? But of these things we are not now to dispute. That which already we haue set downe, is for our present purpose sufficient. By the Church therefore in this question we vnderstand no other then onely the visible Church. For preseruation of Christianity there is not any thing more needfull, then that such as are of the visible Church, haue mutuall fellowship and societie one with another. In which consideration, as the maine body of the sea being one, yet within diuers precincts hath diuers names; so the Catholike Church is in like sort deuided into a number of distinct societies, euery of which is termed a Church within it selfe. In this sense the Church is alwaies a visible society of men; not an assembly, but a society. For although the name of the Church be giuen vnto Christian assemblies, although any multitude of Christian men cōgregated may be termed by the name of a Church; yet assemblies properly are rather things that belong to a Church. Men are assembled for performance of publike actiōs; which actions being ended, the assembly dissolueth it selfe and is no longer in being; wheras the Church which was assembled, doth no lesse continue afterwards then before.Tertul. exhort. ad castit, vbi tre
                     •
                  , Ecclesia est, licet laici. 
               Where but three are, and they of the laity also, sayth Tertullian, yet there is a Church, that is to say, a Christian assembly. But a Church, as now we are to vnderstand it, is a society, that is a number of men belonging vnto some Christian fellowship, the place and limites whereof are certaine. That wherein they haue communion, is the publike exercise of such duties as those mentioned in the Apostles acts,Act. 2.47. 
               Instruction, Breaking of bread, and Prayers. As therefore they that are of the misticall body of Christ, haue those inward graces and vertues, whereby they differ from all others which are not of the same body; againe whosoeuer appertaine to the visible body of the Church, they haue also the notes of externall profession, whereby the world knoweth what they are: after the same manner euen the seuerall societies of Christian men, vnto euery of which the name of a Church is giuen with addition betokening seuerally, as the Church of Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, England, and so the rest, must bee indued with correspondent generall properties belonging vnto them, as they are publique Christian societies. And of such properties common vnto all societies Christian, it may not be denied, that one of the very chiefest is Ecclesiasticall Politie. Which word I therefore the rather vse, because the name of gouernement as commonly men vnderstand it in ordinary speech, doth not comprise the largenes of that whereunto in this question it is applied. For when we speake of gouernment, what doth the greatest part conceiue thereby, but onely the exercise of superiority peculiar vnto rulers

and guides of others? To our purpose therefore the name of Church-politie will better serue, because it conteineth both gouernement, and also whatsoeuer▪ besides belongeth to the ordering of the Church in publique. Neither is any thing in this degree more necessarie then Church politie, which is a forme of ordering the publique spirituall affaires of the Church of God.
            2 But we must note,VVhether it be necessarie that some particular forme of Church-poli

Aemuli sint necesse est, quae Dei non sunt. that he which affirmeth speech to bee necessary amongest all men throughout the world, doth not thereby import that all men must necessarily speake one kind of language. Euen so the necessitie of politie and regiment in all Churches may be held, without holding any one certaine forme to bee necessarie in them all. Nor is it possible that any forme of politie, much lesse of politie Ecclesiasticall, should bee good, vnlesse▪ God himselfe bee author of it. Those things that are not of God (sayth Tertullian) they can haue no other then Gods aduersarie for their author. Be it whatsoeuer in the Church of God, if it bee not of God, wee hate it. Of God it must bee, either as those things sometime were, which God supernaturally reuealed and so deliuered them vnto Moses for gouernement of the common wealth of Israell; or else as those thinges which men finde out by helpe of that light, which God hath giuen them vnto that ende. The verie lawe of nature it selfe, which no man can deny but God hath instituted, is not of God, vnlesse that be of God,Rom. 2.15. Lactan. lib. 6. ca. 8. Ille legi

                whereof God is the author as well this later way as the former. But for as much as no forme of Church-politie is thought by them to be lawfull, or to bee of God, vnlesse God be so the author of it, that it bee also set downe in Scripture; they should tell vs plainely, whether their meaning be, that it must be there set downe in whole or in part. For if wholly, let them shewe what one forme of politie euer was so. Their owne to be so taken out of Scripture they will not affirme; neither denie they that in part, euen this which they so much oppugne is also from thence taken. Againe they should tell vs, whether onely that be taken out of Sripture, which is actually and particularly there set downe; or else that also, which the generall principles and rules of Scripture potentially conteine. The one way they cannot as much as pretend, that all the partes of their owne discipline are in scripture; and the other way their mouthes are stopped, when they would pleade against all other formes besides their owne; seeing the generall principles are such▪ as do not particularly prescribe any one, but sundry may equally be consonant vnto the generall axiomes of the Scripture. But to giue them some larger scope, and not to close them vp in these streights▪ let their allegations bee considered, wherewith they earnestly bend themselues against all, which deny it necessarie that any one complete forme of Church▪politie should bee in Scripture. First therefore whereas it hath beene told them, that matters of faith, and in generall matters necessarie vnto saluation,

Those things you seeme to say, when you say that matters necessary to saluation and of faith are contained in scripture▪ especially when you oppose these things to ceremonies, order, discipline, and gouernement. T. C. lib. 1 p. 16.
                are of a different nature from Ceremonies, order, and the kind of Church gouernement▪ that the one are necessarie to bee expressely contained in the word of God, or else manifestly

collected out of the same, the other not so; that is necessarie not to receiue the one▪ vnlesse there be some thing in Scripture for them, the other free, if nothing against them may thence bee alleaged: although there do not appeare any iust or reasonable cause to reiect or dislike of this, neuerthelesse as it is not easie to speake to the contentation of mindes exulcerated in themselues, but that somewhat there will bee alwayes which displeaseth, so herein for two things we are reprooued; the first is misdistinguishing, because matters of discipline and Church▪gouernement are (as they say) matters necessary to saluation and of faith, whereas we put a difference betweene the one and the other; our second fault is iniurious dealing with the Scripture of God, as if it conteined onely the principall points of religion, some rude and vnfashioned matter of building the Church, but had left out that which belongeth vnto the forme and fashion of it; as if there were in the Scripture no more then only to couer the Churches nakednesse, and not chaines, bracelets, rings, iewels to adorne her; sufficient to quench her thirst, to kill her hunger, but not to minister a more liberall and (as it were) a more delitious and dainty dyet. In which case our apologie shall not need to be very long.
            
               That matters of discipline are different from matters of faith and saluation, and that they them selues so teach which are our reproouers.3 The mixture of those things by speech, which by nature are diuided, is the mother of all error. To take away therefore that error which confusion breedeth distinction is requisite. Rightly to distinguish is by conceipt of minde to seuer thinges different in nature, and to discerne wherein they differ. So that if wee imagine a difference where there is none, because wee distinguish where wee should not, it may not bee denied that wee misdistinguish. The onely tryall whether wee do so, yea or no, dependeth vpon comparison betweene our conceipt and the nature of thinges conceiued. Touching matters belonging vnto the Church of Christ this wee conceiue, that they are not of one sute. Some things are meerely of faith, which things it doth suffice that wee knowe and beleeue: some things not onely to bee knowne, but done, because they concerne the actions of men. Articles about the Trinitie are matters of meere faith, and must bee belieued. Precepts concerning the workes of charitie, are matters of action, which to knowe, vnlesse they bee practised, is not enough. This beeing so cleare to all mens vnderstanding, I somewhat maruaile that they especially should thinke it absurde to oppose Church-gouernement a plaine matter of action vnto matters of faith,

                   speake of the discipline as of a part of the Gospell. If the discipline be one part of the Gospell, what other part can they assigne but doctrine, to answer in diuision to the discipline?
                who know that themselues deuide the Gospell into Doctrine and Discipline. For if matters of discipline be rightly by them distinguished from matters of doctrine, why not matters of gouernmēt by 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
as reasonably set against matters of faith? Do not they vnder doctrine comprehend the same which we intend by matters of faith? Do not they vnder discipline comprise the regiment of the Church? When they blame that in vs, which themselues followe, they giue men great cause to doubt that some other thing then iudgement doth guide their speech. What the Church of God standeth bound to knowe or do, the same in part nature teacheth. And because nature can teach them but onely in part, neither so fully, as is requisite for mans saluation; nor so easily, as to make the way plaine and expedite enough, that many may come to the knowledge of it and so be saued; therefore in Scripture hath God both collected the most necessarie things, that the Schoole of nature teacheth vnto that end; and reuealeth also whatsoeuer we neither could with safety bee ignorant of, nor at all be instructed in but by supernaturall reuelation from him. So that Scripture conteining all things that are in this kind any way needfull for the Church, and the principall of the other sort, this is the next thing wherewith we are charged as with an errour: we teach that whatsoeuer is vnto saluation termed necessarie by way of excellencie, whatsoeuer it standeth all men vppon to knowe or do that they may be saued, whatsoeuer there is whereof it may truely be sayd, This not to beleeue is eternall death and damnation, or, This euery soule that will liue must duly obserue, of which sort the Articles of Christian faith, and the Sacraments of the Church of Christ are; all such things if Scripture did not comprehend, the Church of God should not bee able to measure out the length and the breadth of that way wherein for euer she is to walke. Heretiques and Schismatiques neuer ceasing, some to abridge, some to enlarge, all to peruert and obscure the same. But as for those things that are accessorie hereunto, those things that so belong to the way of saluation, as to alter them is no otherwise to chaunge that way, then a path is chaunged by altering onely the vppermost face thereof, which be it layd with grauell, or set with grasse, or paued with stone, remaineth still the same path; in such things because discretion may teach the Church what is conuenient, we hold not the Church further tied herein vnto Scripture, then that against Scripture nothing be admitted in the Church, least that path which ought alwayes to be kept euen, do thereby come to be ouer-growne with brambles and thornes. If this be vnsound, wherein doth the point of vnsoundnesse lye? It is not that we make some things necessarie, some things accessorie and appendent onely.Matth. 23.23. For our Lord and Sauiour himselfe doth make that difference, by termin

                iudgement, and mercie, and fidelitie, with other things of like nature, the greater and waightier matters of the lawe. Is it then in that wee account Ceremonies (wherein wee do not comprise Sacraments, or any other the like substantiall duties in the exercise of Religion, but onely such externall rites as are vsually annexed vnto Church-actions,) is it an ouersight, that we recken these thinges and The gouernement of the Church of Christ graunted by Fennar himselfe, to be though a matter of great moment, yet not of the substance of religion. Against D▪ Bridges. pag. 121. if it be Fennar which was the author of that Booke. matters of gouernement in the number of things accessorie, not things necessarie in such sort as hath beene declared? Let them which therefore thinke vs blameable, consider well their owne words.

Do they not plainely compare the one vnto garments which couer the body of the Church, the other vnto rings, braslets, and iewels that onely adorne it; the one to that food which the Church doth liue by, the other to that which maketh her dyet liberall, daintie, and more delitious? Is dainty fare a thing necessary to the sustenance, or to the clothing of the body rich attire? If not, how can they vrge the necessity of that which themselues resemble by things not necessary? Or by what construction shall any man liuing be able to make those comparisons true, holding that distinction vntrue, which putteth a difference betweene things of externall regiment in the Church, and things necessarie vnto saluation?
            
               That we doe not take from Scripture any thing which may be thereunto giuen with soundnesse of truth: Arist. pol. li. 1. cap. 8. & Plato in Menex. Arist. lib. 3. de Anima. cap. 45.4 Now as it can be to nature no iniury, that of her we say the same which diligent beholders of her workes haue obserued, namely, that she prouideth for all liuing creatures nourishment which may suffice, that she bringeth foorth no kind of creature whereto she is wanting in that which is needfull; although we do not so farre magnifie her exceeding bountie, as to affirme that she bringeth into the world the sonnes of men adorned with gorgeous attire, or maketh costly buildings to spring vp out of the earth for them: So I trust that to mention what the Scripture of God leaueth vnto the Churches discretion in some things, is not in any thing to impaire the honour which the Church of God yeeldeth to the sacred scriptures perfection. Wherein seeing that no more is by vs maintained, then onely that scripture must needs teach the Church whatsoeuer is in such sort necessarie as hath bene set downe; and that it is no more disgrace for scripture to haue left a number of other things free to be ordered at the discretion of the Church, then for nature to haue left it vnto the wit of man to deuise his owne attire, and not to looke for it as the beasts of the field haue theirs: If neither this can import, nor any other proofe sufficient be brought foorth, that we either will at any time or euer did affirme the sacred Scripture to comprehend no more then onely those bare necessaries; if we acknowledge that as well for particular application to speciall occasions, as also in other manifold respects infinite treasures of wisedome are ouer and besides aboundantly to be found in the holy Scripture; yea that scarcely there is any noble part of knowledge, worthie the minde of man, but from thence it may haue some direction and light; yea that athough there bee no necessitie it should of purpose prescribe any one particular for

Which point I wish they did well obserue, with whom nothing is more familiar then to plead in these causes, The law of God, The word of the Lord: who notwithstanding when they come to alleage what word and what lawe they meane, their common ordinarie practise is, to quote by-speeches in some historicall narration or other, and to vrge them as if they were written in most exact forme of law. What is to adde to the lawe of God, if this bee not? When that which the word of God doth but deliuer historically, we conster without any warrant as if it were legally meant, and so vrge it further then we can proue that it was intended, do we not adde to the lawes of God, and make them in number seeme moe then they are? It standeth vs vpon to be carefull in this case. For the sentence of God is heauy against them, that wittingly shall presume thus to vse the Scripture.

The custome both mentioned by Iosephus in the history of his owne life, and by the words of Peter signified.Act. 2. Tedious it were to rip vp all such things, as were in that Church established, yea by Christ himselfe and by his Apostles obserued, though not commaunded any where in Scripture.
            
               
                  A shift to maintaine that.
                  Nothing ought to be established in the Church, which is not commanded in the word of God; Namely that commandements are of two sorts▪ and that all things lawfull in the Church are commanded, if not by speciall precepts, yet by generall rules in the word. 1. Cor. 10.32. 1. Cor. 14.40. 1. Cor. 14 26. Rom. 14.6.7.
               7 Well, yet a glosse there is to colour that paradoxe, and notwithstanding all this, still to make it appeare in shew not to be altogether vnreasonable. And therefore till further reply come, the cause is held by a feeble distinction; that the commandements of God being either generall or speciall, although there be no expresse word for euery thing in specialtie, yet there are generall commaundements for all things, to the end that euen such cases as are not in Scripture particularly mentioned, might not be left to any to order at their pleasure, onely with caution that nothing be done against the word of God: and that for this cause the Apostle hath set downe in scripture foure generall rules, requiring such things alone to be receiued in the Church, as do best and neerest agree with the same rules, that so all things in the Church may be appointed, not onely not against, but by and according to the word of God. The rules are these, Nothing scandalous or offensiue vnto any, especially vnto the Church of God; All things in order and with seemelinesse; All vnto edification; finally All to the glory of God. Of which kind how many might be gathered out of the Scripture, if it were necessary to take so much paines? Which rules they that vrge, minding thereby to proue that nothing may be done in the Church but what Scripture commaundeth, must needs hold that they tye the Church of Christ no otherwise, then onely because we find them there set downe by the finger of the holy Ghost. So that vnlesse the Apostle by writing had deliuered those rules to the Church, we should by obseruing them haue sinned, as now by not obseruing them.T. C. l. 1. p. 35. In the Church of the Iewes is it not graunted, that the appointment of the hower for daily sacrifices; the building of Synagogues throughout the land to heare the word of God and to pray in, when they came not vp to Ierusalem; the erecting of Pulpets & Chaires to teach in; the order of buriall, the rites of mariage, with such like, being matters appertaining to the Church, yet are not any where prescribed in the law, but were by the Churches discretion instituted? What then shall we thinke? Did they hereby adde to the law, and so displeas
                  •
                God by that which they did? None so hardly perswaded of them. Doth their law deliuer vnto thē the self same general rules of the apostle, that framing therby their orders they might in that respect cleare thēselues frō doing amisse?

S. Paule would then of likelihood haue cited them out of the Law, which we see he doth not. The truth is, they are rules and Canons of that law, which is written in all men hearts; the Church had for euer no lesse then now stood bound to obserue them, whether the Apostle had mentioned them or no. Seeing therefore those Canons do bind as they are edicts of nature, which the Iewes obseruing as yet vnwritten, and thereby framing such Church-orders as in their lawe were not prescribed, are notwithstanding in that respect vnculpable; it followeth that sundry things may be lawfully done in the Church, so as they be not done against the Scripture, although no Scripture do commaund them, but the Church only following the light of reason, iudge them to be in discretion meete. Secondly vnto our purpose and for the question in hand, whether the commaundements of God in Scripture be generall or speciall, it skilleth not. For if being particularly applied, they haue in regard of such particulars a force constraining vs to take some one certaine thing of many, and to leaue the rest, whereby it would come to passe, that any other particular but that one being established, the generall rules themselues in that case would be broken; then is it vtterly impossible that God should leaue any thing great or small free for the Church to establish or not. Thirdly if so be they shall graunt, as they cannot otherwise do, that these rules are no such lawes as require any one particular thing to be done; but serue rather to direct the Church in all things which she doth, so that free and lawfull it is to deuise any Ceremony, to receiue any order, and to authorize any kind of regiment, no speciall commandement being thereby violated, and the same being thought such by them to whom the iudgement thereof appertaineth, as that it is not scandalous, but decent, tending vnto edification, and setting forth the glory of God, that is to say agreeable vnto the generall rules of holy Scripture; this doth them no good in the world for the furtherance of their purpose. That which should make for them, must proue that men ought not to make lawes for Church regiment, but onely keepe those lawes which in Scripture they find made. The plaine intent of the booke of Ecclesiasticall discipline is to shew, that men may not deuise lawes of Church gouernment; but are bound for euer to vse and to execute only those, which God himselfe hath already deuised and deliuered in the Scripture. The selfe same drift the Admonitioners also had, in vrging that nothing ought to be done in the Church according vnto any lawe of mans deuising, but all according to that which God in his word hath commanded. Which not remembring, they gather out of Scripture generall rules to bee followed in making lawes; and so in effect they plainely graunt, that we our selues may lawfully make lawes for the Church, and are not bound out of Scripture onely to take lawes already made, as they meant who first alleaged that principle whereof we speake. One particular platforme it is which they respected, and which they labored thereby to force vpon all Churches; whereas these generall rules do not let, but that there may well enough be sundrie. It is the particular order established in the Church of England, which thereby they did intend to alter, as being not commanded of God; whereas vnto those generall rules they know we do not defend that we may hold any thing vncomfortable. Obscure it is not what meaning they had, who first gaue out that graund axiome: and according vnto

that meaning it doth preuaile farre and wide with the fauourers of that part. Demaund of them, wherefore they conforme not themselues vnto the order of our Church, and in euery particular their answer for the most part is, We find no such thing commaunded in the word. Whereby they plainely require some speciall commaundement for that which is exacted at their hands, neither are they content to haue matters of the Church examined by generall rules and Canons. As therefore in controuersies betweene vs and the Church of Rome, that which they practise is many times euen according to the very grosnesse of that which the vulgar sort conceiueth; when that which they teach to maintaine it is so nice and subtle, that hold can very hardly be taken thereupon; in which cases we should do the Church of God small benefite, by disputing with them according vnto the finest points of their darke conueyances, and suffering that sense of their doctrine to go vncontrolled, wherein by the common sort it is ordinarily receiued and practised: So considering what disturbance hath growne in the Church amongst our selues, and how the authors thereof do commonly build altogether on this as a sure foundation, Nothing ought to be established in the Church which in the word of God is not commanded; were it reason that we should suffer the same to passe without controulement, in that currant meaning whereby euery where it preuaileth, and still till some strange construction were made thereof, which no man would lightly haue thought on but being driuen thereunto for a shift?
            8 The last refuge in maintaining this position,Another aunswere in defence of the former assertion, whereby the meaning thereof is opened in this sort. All Church orders must be commaunded in the word, that is to say, grounded vpon the word, and made according at the leastwise vnto the generall rules of holy Scripture. As for such things as are found out by any starre or light of reason, and are in that respect receiued so they be not against the word of God, all such things it holdeth vnlawfully receiued. is thus to conster it; Nothing ought to be established in the Church, but that which is commaunded in the word of God; that is to say, All Church-orders must be grounded vpon the word of God, in such sort grounded vpon the word, not that being found out by some starre or light of reason, or learning, or other helpe, they may be receiued, so they be not against the word of God; but according at least wise vnto the generall rules of Scripture they must bee made. VVhich is in effect as much as to say, We knowe not what to say well in defence of this position; and therefore least we should say it is false, there is no remedie but to say that in some sense or other it may be true, if we could tell howe. First that Scholie had neede of a very fauourable Reader and a tractable, that should thinke it plaine construction, when to be commaunded in the word and grounded vpon the word are made all one. If when a man may liue in the state of Matrimonie, seeking that good thereby which nature principally desireth,Arist. polit. 1. 1. Cor. 7. he make rather choyce of a contrarie life in regard of Saint Paules iudgement; that which hee doth is manifestly grounded vppon the word of God, yet not commaunded in his word, because without breach of any commaundement hee might do otherwise. Secondly whereas no man in iustice and reason can be reproued, for those actions which are framed according vnto that knowne will of God, whereby they are to bee iudged; and the will of God which wee are to iudge our actions by, no sound Diuine in the world euer denied to bee in parte made manifest euen by

light of nature and not by scripture alone; if the Church being directed by the former of these two, (which God hath giuen who gaue the other, that man might in different sort be guided by them both,) if the Church I say do approue and establish that which thereby it iudgeth meete, and findeth not repugnant to any word or syllable of holy scripture, who shall warrant our presumptuous boldnes controwling herein the Church of Christ? But so it is, the name of the light of nature is made hatefull with men; the starre of Reason and learning, and all other such like helps, beginneth no otherwise to be thought of, then if it were an vnluckie Comet, or as if God had so accursed it, that it should neuer shine or giue light in things concerning our dutie any way towardes him, but be esteemed as that starre in the Reuelation called wormewood,
               Apoc. 8.10. which beeing fallen from heauen, maketh riuers and waters in which it falleth so bitter, that men tasting them dye thereof. A number there are, who thinke they cannot admire as they ought the power and authoritie of the worde of God, if in things diuine they should attribute any force to mans reason. For which cause they neuer vse reason so willingly as to disgrace reason. Their vsuall and common discourses are vnto this effect.1. Cor. 2.14. 1. The naturall man perceiueth not the thinges of the spirit of God: for they are foolishnesse vnto him; neither can he knowe them, because they are spiritually discerned.

                  ie, that is to say, such knowledge as men by naturall reason attaine vnto. 3. Consider them that haue from time to time opposed themselues against the Gospell of Christ, and most troubled the Church with Heresie. Haue they not alwayes bene great admirers of humane reason? Hath their deepe and profound skill in secular learning, made them the more obedient to the truth, and not armed them rather against it? 4. They that feare God will remember how heauie his sentences are in this case; I will destroy the wisdome of the wise,
               1. Cor. 1.19. 
               and will cast away the vnderstanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the Scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made the wisedome of this world foolishnesse? Seeing the world by wisedome knewe not God in the wisedome of God, it pleased God by the foolishnesse of preaching to saue beleeuers. 5. The word of God in it selfe is absolute, exact, and perfect. The word of God is a two edged sword: as for the weapons of naturall reason, they are as the armour of Saule, rather cumbersome about the souldier of Christ then needefull. They are not of force to doe that, which the Apostles of Christ did by the power of the holy Ghost. My preaching, therefore sayth Paule, hath not bene in the intising speech of mans wisedome, but in plaine euidence of the spirit and of power;

               that your faith might not bee in the wisedome of men, but in the power of God. 6. If I beleeue the Gospell, there needeth no reasoning about it to perswade mee: If I doe not beleeue, it must bee the spirit of God, and not the reason of man, that shall conuert my heart vnto him. By these and the like disputes an opinion hath spread it selfe very farre in the world, as if the way to bee ripe in faith, were to bee rawe in wit and iudgement; as if reason were an enemie vnto religion, childish simplicitie the mother of ghostly and diuine wisedome. The cause why such declamations preuaile so greatly, is for that men suffer themselues in two respects to bee deluded; one is that the wisedome of man being

debased, either in comparison with that of God, or in regard of some speciall thing exceeding the reach and compasse thereof, it seemeth to them (not marking so much) as if simply it were condemned: an other, that learning, knowledge, or wisdome falsely so tearmed, vsurping a name wherof they are not worthy, and being vnder that name controlled, their reproofe is by so much the more easily misapplied, and through equiuocation wrested against those things wherunto so pretious names do properly and of right belong. This duly obserued, doth to the former allegations it selfe make sufficient answere.  Howbeit for all mens plainer and fuller satisfaction, first concerning the inhabilitie of reason to search out and to iudge of things diuine; if they be such as those properties of God, and those duties of men towards him, which may be conceiued by attentiue consideration of heauen and earth; we know that of meere natural men, the Apostle testifieth,Rom. 1.21. how they knew both God, and the lawe of God. Other things of God there be,verse 31. which are neither so found, nor though they be shewed, can euer be approued without the speciall operation of Gods good grace & spirit. Of such things sometime spake the Apostle S. Paul, declaring how Christ had called him to be a witnesse of his death and resurrection from the dead, according to that which the Prophets and Moses had foreshewed. Festus a meere naturall man, an Infidell, a Romane, one whose eares were vnacquainted with such matter, heard him, but could not reach vnto that whereof he spake; the suffering and the rising of Christ frō the dead▪ he reiecteth as idle superstitious phancies not worth the hearing.Act. 25.19. The Apostle that knew them by the spirit, & spake of them with power of the holy Ghost,Act. 26.24. seemed in his eyes but learnedly mad. Which example maketh manifest what elswhere the same Apostle teacheth, namely that nature hath need of grace;1. Cor. 2.14. wherunto I hope we are not opposite, by holding that grace hath vse of nature.  2. Philosophie we are warned to take heed of: Not that Philosophie, which is true and sound knowledge attained by naturall discourse of reason; but that Philosophie which to bolster heresie or error, casteth a fraudulent shew of reason vpō things which are indeed vnreasonable, and by that meane as by a stratagem spoileth the simple which are not able to withstād such cunning. Take heed least any spoile you through philosophie and vain deceit. He that exhorteth to beware of an enemies policie,Col. 2.8. doth not giue counsell to be impolitique; but rather to vse all prouident foresight and circumspection, least our simplicitie be ouerreacht by cunning sleights. The way not to be inueigled by them that are so guilefull through skill, is thorowly to be instructed in that which maketh skilfull against guile, and to be armed with that true and sincere philosophy, which doth teach, against that deceiptfull and vaine, which spoileth.  3. But many great Philosophers haue bene very vnsound in beliefe. And many sound in beliefe, haue bene also great Philosophers. Could secular knowledge bring the one sort vnto the loue of Christian faith? Nor Christian faith the other sort out of loue with secular knowledge. The harme that heretiques did, they did it vnto such, as were vnable to discerne betweene sound and deceiptfull reasoning; and the remedie against it, was euer the skill which the auncient Fathers had to discrie and discouer such deceipt. In so much that Cresconius the heretique complained greatly of S. Augustine, as being too full of logicall subtilties. Heresie preuaileth onely by a counterfeit shewe of reason; whereby notwithstanding it becommeth inuincible,

vnlesse it be conuicted of fraude by manifest remonstrance, clearely true, and vnable to be withstood. When therefore the Apostle requireth habilitie to conuict Heretiques, can we thinke he iudgeth it a thing vnlawfull,Tit. 1.9.11. and not rather needfull to vse the principall instrument of their conuiction, the light of reason? It may not be denied but that in the Fathers writings there are sundrie sharpe inuectiues against Heretiques, euen for their very philosophicall reasonings. The cause wherof Tertullian confesseth, not to haue bene any dislike conceiued against the kinde of such reasonings, but the end.Tertul. de Resur. carnis.

                     •
                  ster error; so they make with, not against that which God hath determined. For there are some things euen knowne by nature, as the immortalitie of the soule vnto many, our God vnto all▪ I will therfore my selfe also vse the sentence of some such as Plato, pronouncing euery soule immortall. I my selfe too will vse the secret acknowledgement of the cōmunaltie, bearing record of the God of Gods. But when I heare men alleage, That which is dead is dead; and, while thou art aliue be aliue; and, After death an end of all euen of death it selfe: then will I call to minde both that the heart of the people with God is accounted dust, and that the very wisdome of the world is pronounced folly. If then an heretique flye also vnto such vitious popular and secular conceipts, my answere vnto him shalbe; Thou heretique auoyd the heathen; although in this ye be one, that ye both bely God; yet thou that doest this vnder the name of Christ, differest frō the heathen, in that thou seemest to thy selfe a christiā. Leaue him therfore his conceits, seeing that neither will he learne thine. Why doest thou hauing sight, trust to a blinde guide, thou which hast put on Christ, take raiment of him that is naked? If the Apostle haue armed thee, why doest thou borrow a straungers shield? Let him rather learne of thee to acknowledge, then thou of him to renounce the resurrection of the flesh. In a word▪ the Catholique Fathers did good vnto all by that knowledge, whereby heretiques hindering the truth in many, might haue furthered therwith themselues, but that obstinately following their owne ambitious or otherwise corrupted affections, in stead of framing their wills to maintaine that which reason taught, they bent their wits to finde how reason might seeme to teach that which their wills were set to maintaine. For which cause the Apostle saith of them iustly,Tit. 3.11. that they are for the most part 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , men condemned euen in and of themselues. For though they be not all perswaded that it is truth which they withstand; yet that to be error which they vphold, they might vndoubtedly the sooner a great deale attaine to know, but that their studie is more to defend what once they haue stood in, then to finde out sincerely and simply what truth they ought to persist in for euer.  4. There is in the world no kinde of knowledge, whereby any part of truth is seene, but wee iustly account it pretious; yea that principall truth, in comparison whereof all other knowledge is vile, may receiue from it some kinde of light. Whether it be that Egyptian and Chaldaean wisedome Mathematicall, wherewith Moses and Daniell were furnished;Act. 7.22. or that naturall, morall, and ciuill wisedome, wherein Salomon excelled all men;Dan. 1.17. 1. King. 4.29.30 or that rationall and oratoriall wisedome of the Graecians, which the Apostle Saint Paul brought from Tarsus; or that Iudaicall;Act. 22.3 which he learned in Ierusalem sitting at the feete of Gamaliell; to detract frō the dignitie therof, were to iniurie euen God himselfe, who being that light which none can approch vnto, hath sent out these lights wherof we are capable, euē as so many sparkls resēbling the bright foūtain

These being wholly addicted vnto their owne willes, vse their wit, their learning, and all the wisedome they haue, to maintaine that which their obstinate hearts are delighted with▪ esteeming in the phrentique error of their mindes, the greatest madnesse in the world to be wisedome, and the highest wisdom foolishnes. Such were both Iewes and Graecians, which professed the one sort legall, and the other secular skill, neither induring to bee taught the mystery of Christ: vnto the glory of whose most blessed name, who so studie to vse both their reason and all other gifts as wel which nature as which grace hath indued thē with▪ let them neuer doubt but that the same God, who is to destroy & confound vtterly that wisdome falsely so named in others, doth make reckoning of them as of true Scribes,Matth. 13.52. Scribes by wisdome instructed to the kingdome of heauen, not Scribes against that kingdome hardned in a vaine opinion of wisdom, which in the end being proued folly, must needs perish, true vnderstāding, knowledge, iudgemēt & reason, continuing for euermore.  5. Vnto the word of God, being in respect of that end for which God ordeined it, perfect, exact, and absolute in it selfe, we do not adde reason as a supplemēt of any maime or defect therin, but as a necessary instrument, without which we could not reape by the scriptures perfection, that fruite & benefite which it yeeldeth. The word of God is a two edged sword,Hebr. 4.12. but in the hāds of reasonable men; & reason as the weapon that slewe Goliath, if they be as Dauid was that vse it. Touching the Apostles, hee which gaue them from aboue such power for miraculous confirmation of that which they taught, indued, thē also with wisdom frō aboue to teach that which they so did confirme. Our Sauiour made choise of 12▪ simple & vnlearned men, that the greater their lack of natural wisdom was, the more admirable that might appeare, which God supernaturally indued thē with frō heauen. Such therfore as knew the poore & silly estate wherin they had liued, could not but wonder to heare the wisdome of their speech, & be so much the more attentiue vnto their teaching. They studied for no toong they spake withall; of thēselues they were rude & knew not so much as how to premeditate, the spirit gaue them speech & eloquēt v

Paul it was otherwise then with the rest, in as much as he neuer conuersed with Christ vpō earth as they did; and his education had bin scholasticall altogether, which theirs was not; hereby occasion was taken by certaine malignants, secretly to vndermine his great authoritie in the Church of Christ, as though the Gospell had bin taught him by others then by Christ himself▪ & as if the cause of the Gentiles conuersion & beliefe through his meanes, had bin the learning and skill which he had by being conuersant in their books, which thing made thē so willing to heare him, & him so able to perswade thē, wheras the rest of th' Apostles preuailed, because God was with them, & by miracle frō heauen confirmed his word in their mouthes. They were mightie in deeds: As for him, being absēt his writings had some force, in presence his power not like vnto theirs. In summe, cōcerning his preaching, their very by word was,

Paul was so often driuen to make his apologies. Herevpō it riseth, that whatsoeuer time he had spent in the study of humane learning,

he maketh earnest protestation to them of Corinth, that the Gospell which hee had preached amongst them, did not by other meanes preuaile with them,1. Cor. 2.4. then with others the same Gospel taught by the rest of the Apostles of Christ. My preaching, saith he, hath not bene in the perswasiue speeches of humane wisdome, but in demonstratiō of the spirit & of power, that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. What is it which the Apostle doth here denie? Is it denied that his speech amongst thē had bin perswasiue? No, for of him the sacred history plainely testifieth, that for the space of a yeare & a half he spake in their Synagogue euery Saboth, and perswaded both Iewes and Graecians. How then is the speech of men made perswasiue? Surely there can be but two waies to bring this to passe,Act. 18.

                  1. v. 4. the one humane, the other diuine. Either S. Paul did onely by arte and naturall industrie cause his owne speech to be credited; or else God by myracle did authorize it, & so bring credit thereunto, as to the speech of the rest of the Apostles. Of which two the former he vtterly denieth. For why? If the preaching of the rest had bene effectuall by miracle, his onely by force of his owne learning; so great inequalitie between him & the other Apostles in this thing▪ had bin enough to subuert their faith. For might they not with reasō haue thought, that if he were sent of God as wel as they, God would not haue furnished thē & not him with the power of the holy Ghost? Might not a great part of them being simple happily haue feared, least their assent had bene cunningly gotten vnto his doctrine, rather through the weaknes of their owne wits, thē the certaintie of that truth which he had taught them? How vnequall had it bin, that al beleeuers through the preaching of other Apostles should haue their faith strongly built vpon the euidence of Gods own miraculous approbatiō, & they whō he had cōuerted should haue their perswasion built only vpon his skill & wisdome who perswaded them? As therfore calling frō men may authorize vs to teach, although it could not authorize him to teach as other Apostles did: so although the wisdom of man had not bin sufficient to inable him such a teacher as the rest of the Apostles were, vnles Gods miracles had strengthned both the one & the others doctrine; yet vnto our habilitie both of teaching & learning the truth of Christ, as we are but meere Christiā mē it is not a litle which the wisdome of man may adde.  6. Yea whatsoeuer our harts be to God & to his truth, beleeue we or be we as yet faithles, for our conuersion or confirmatiō the force of natural reason is great. The force whereof vnto those effects is nothing without grace. What then? To our purpose it is sufficient, that whosoeuer doth serue, honor & obey God, whosoeuer beleeueth in him, that mā would no more do this then innocents & infants do, but for the light of natural reason that shineth in him, & maketh him apt to apprehend those things of God, which being by grace discouered,Heb. 11.6. are effectuall to perswade reasonable mindes and none other, that honour obedience and credit belong aright vnto God. No man cōmeth vnto God to offer him sacrifice, to poure out supplications & praiers before him, or to do him any seruice, which doth not first beleeue him both to be, & to be a rewarder of them who in such sort seeke vnto him. Let men bee taught this either by reuelation from heauen, or by instruction vpon earth, by labor, studie and meditation, or by the onely secret inspiration of the holy Ghost; whatsoeuer the meane be they know it by, if the knowledge therof were possible without discourse of natural reasō, why should none be foūd capable therof but only mē, nor mē til such time as they come vnto ripe & full habilitie to work by

               1. Cor. 10.15. 
               Theologie what is it but the science of things diuine? What science can be attained vnto without the help of natural discourse & reasō? Iudge you of that which I speake, saith the Apostle. In vaine it were to speake any thing of God, but that by reason mē are able somewhat to iudge of that they heare, & by discourse to discerne how cōsonāt it is to truth. Scripture indeed teacheth things aboue nature, things which our reason by it selfe could not reach vnto. Yet those things also we beleeue, knowing by reason yt the scripture is the word of God. In the presence of Festus a Romane, and of King Agrippa a Iew, S. Paul omitting the one, who neither knew the Iewes religion, nor the books wherby they were taught it, speaketh vnto the other of things foreshewed by Moses & the Prophets, & performed in Iesus Christ; intending therby to proue himselfe so vniustly accused,Act. 26.22. that vnlesse his iudges did cōdemne both Moses & the Prophets, him they could not choose but acquite, who taught only that fulfilled, which they so long since had foretolde. His cause was easie to be discerned; what was done their eies were witnesses; what Moses & the Prophets did speake, their bookes could quicly shew; it was no hard thing for him to cōpare them, which knew the one, & beleeued the other. King Agrippa beleeuest thou the Prophets? I know thou dost. The questiō is how the bookes of the Prophets came to be credited of king Agrippa. For what with him did authorize the Prophets, the like with vs doth cause the rest of the scripture of God to be of credit. Because we maintain that in scripture we are taught all things necessary vnto saluation, hereupon very childishly it is by some demanded, what scripture can teach vs the sacred authoritie of the scripture, vpō the knowledge wherof our whole faith & saluation dependeth. As though there were any kind of science in the world, which leadeth men into knowledge, without presupposing a number of thinges alreadie knowne. No science doth make knowne the first principles whereon it buildeth; but they are alwaies either taken as plaine and manifest in themselues, or as proued and granted already, some former knowledge hauing made them euident. Scripture teacheth al supernaturally reuealed truth, without the knowledge wherof saluatiō cannot be attained. The maine principle wherupon our beliefe of al things therin contained dependeth, is that the scriptures are the oracles of God himselfe. This in it selfe wee cannot say is euident. For thē all men that heare it would acknowledge it in hart, as they do when they heare that euery whole is more then any part of that whole, because this in it selfe is euident. The other we know that all do not acknowledge when they heare it. There must be therefore some former knowledge presupposed, which doth herein assure the hearts of all beleeuers. Scripture teacheth vs that sauing truth which God hath discouered vnto the world by reuelation; & it presumeth vs taught otherwise that it self is diuine & sacred. The questiō thē being by what meanes we are taught this; some answere that to learne it we haue no other way then only traditiō; as namely that so we beleeue, because both we from our predecessors, & they from theirs haue so receiued. But is this inough? That which al mens experience teacheth them, may not in any wise be denied. And by experience we all know, that the first outward motiue leading men so to esteeme of the scripture, is the authority of Gods church. For whē we know the whole church of God hath that opiniō of the scripture, we iudge it euen at the first an impudēt thing for any man bredde and brought vp in the Church, to bee of a contrary

mind without cause. Afterwards the more we bestow our labor in reading or hearing the misteries thereof, the more we find that the thing it selfe doth answer our receiued opinion concerning it. So that the former inducement preuailing somwhat with vs before, doth now much more preuaile, when the very thing hath ministred farther reason. If Infidels or Atheists chance at any time to call it in question, this giueth vs occasion to sift what reason there is, whereby the testimony of the church cōcerning scripture, & our own perswasiō which scripture it selfe hath confirmed, may be proued a truth infallible. In which case the ancient fathers being often constrained to shew, what warrant they had so much to relie vpō the scriptures, endeuored still to maintain the authority of the books of God, by arguments such as vnbeleeuers thēselues must needs think reasonable, if they iudged therof as they shuld. Neither is it a thing impossible or greatly hard, euen by such kind of proofes so to manifest & cleere that point, that no mā liuing shalbe able to deny it, without denying some apparent principle such as al men acknowledge to be true. Wherefore if I beleeue the gospell, yet is reason of singular vse, for that it confirmeth me in this my beleefe the more: If I do not as yet beleeue, neuertheles to bring me to the number of beleeuers except reasō did somwhat helpe, & were an instrument which God doth vse vnto such purposes, what should it boote to dispute with Infidels or godles persons for their conuersion & perswasion in that point? Neither can I thinke that when graue & learned men do sometime hold, that of this principle there is no proofe but by the testimony of the spirit, which assureth our harts therin, it is their meaning to exclude vtterly all force which any kind of reason may haue in that behalfe: but I rather iucline to interpret such their speeches, as if they had more expresly set downe, that other motiues & inducemēts, be they neuer so strong & consonāt vnto reason, are notwithstanding vneffectual of thēselues to worke faith concerning this principle, if the special grace of the holy ghost concur not to the inlightning of our minds. For otherwise I doubt not but mē of wisdom & iudgemēt wil grant, that the Church in this point especially is furnished with reason, to stop the mouthes of her impious aduersaries: and that as it were altogether bootles to alleage against thē, what the spirit hath taught vs; so likewise that euen to our owne selues it needeth caution and explicatiō, how the testimony of the spirit may be discerned, by what meanes it may be known, least mē think that the spirit of God doth testifie those things, which the spirit of error suggesteth. The operations of the spirit, especially these ordinary which be cōmon vnto all true christian men, are as we know, things secret & vndiscernable euen to the very soule where they are, because their nature is of an other & an higher kind thē that they cā be by vs perceiued in this life. Wherfore albeit the spirit lead vs into all truth, & direct vs in all goodnes; yet because these workings of the spirit in vs are so priuy & secret, we therfore stand on a plainer ground, when we gather by reason frō the quality of things beleeued or done, that the spirit of God hath directed vs in both; then if we settle our selues to beleeue, or to do any certaine particular thing, as being moued thereto by the spirit. But of this enough. To go frō the books of scripture to the sense & meaning therof; because the sentēces which are by the Apostles recited out of the Psalms to proue the resurrectiō of Iesus Christ, did not proue it,Act. 13.36. & cap. 2.34. if so be the prophet Dauid meant thē of himsef; this expositiō therfore they plainly disproue, & shew by manifest reason, that of Dauid the words of Dauid could

not possibly be meant. Exclude the vse of naturall reasoning about the sense of holy scripture concerning the articles of our faith, & then that the scripture doth concerne the articles of our faith, who can assure vs? That which by right exposition buildeth vp Christian faith, being misconstrued breedeth error: between true and false construction, the difference reason must shew. Can Christian men perform that which Peter requireth at their hands;1. Pet. 3.15. is it possible they should both beleeue, & be able, without the vse of reason, to render a reason of their beleefe, a reason sound and sufficient to answer them that demaund it, be they of the same faith with vs or enemies therunto? may we cause our faith without reason to appeare reasonable in the eyes of men? This being required euen of learners in the schoole of Christ; the duty of their teachers in bringing them vnto such ripenes, must needes be somewhat more, then only to read the sentences of scripture, and then paraphrastically to scholie them, to vary thē with sundry formes of speech, without arguing or disputing about anything which they contain. This method of teaching may cōmend it selfe vnto the world by that easines & facilitie which is in it: but a law or a patterne it is not, as some do imagine, for all men to follow that will do good in the Church of Christ. Our Lord and Sauiour himselfe did hope by disputation to do some good, yea by disputatiō not onely of, but against the truth, albeit with purpose for the truth. That Christ should be the sonne of Dauid was truth; yet against this truth our Lorde in the Gospell obiecteth, If Christ be the son of Dauid,Matth. 22.43. how doth Dauid call him Lord? There is as yet no way knowne how to dispute, or to determine of things disputed, without the vse of naturall reason▪ If we please to adde vnto Christ their example, who followed him as neere in all thinges as they could, the Sermon of Paule and Barnabas set downe in the Actes, where the people would haue offered vnto them sacrifice▪ in that Sermon what is there but onely naturall reason to disproue their acte? O men why doe you these thinges? We are men euen subiect to the selfe same passions with you:
               Act. 14.15. 
               wee preach vnto you to leaue these vanities, and to turne to the liuing God, the God that hath not left himselfe without witnesse, in that he hath done good to the world, giuing raine and fruitfull seasons, filling our heart with ioy and gladnesse. Neither did they onely vse reason in winning such vnto Christian beleefe as were yet thereto vnconuerted, but with beleeuers themselues they followed the selfesame course. In that great and solemne assembly of beleeuing Iewes, how doth Peter proue that the Gentiles were partakers of the grace of God as well as they, but by reason drawne from those effectes, which were apparently knowne amongst them?Act. 15. 
               God which knoweth hearts, hath borne them witnesse in giuing vnto them the holy Ghost as vnto vs. The light therefore which the starre of naturall reason and wisedome casteth, is too bright to be obscured by the mist of a word or two, vttered to diminish that opinion which iustly hath beene receiued concerning the force and vertue thereof, euen in matters that touch most nearely the principall duties of men, and the glory of the eternall God. In all which hitherto hath beene spoken touching the force and vse of mans reason in thinges diuine, I must craue that I be not so vnderstood or cōstrued, as if any such thing by vertue thereof could be done without the aide and assistance of Gods most blessed spirit. The thing wee haue handled according to the question mooued about it; which question is, whether the light of reason be so pernitious, that in

For although it were in vaine to make laws which the scripture hath already made, because what we are already there cōmanded to do, on our parts there resteth nothing but only that it be executed: yet because both in that which we are commanded, in concerneth the duty of the church by law to prouide, that the loosenes and slacknes of men may not cause the commandements of God to be vnexecuted; and a number of things there are for which the scripture hath not prouided by any law, but left them vnto the carefull discretion of the Church; we are to search how the Church in these cases may be well directed, to make that prouision by lawes which is most conuenient &c fit. And what is so in these cases, partly scripture, and partly reason must teach to discerne.

               as out of certaine cōmon & vndemonstrable principles, mans reason doth necessarily proceede, vnto certaine more particular determinations; which particular determinations beeing found out according vnto the reason of man, they haue

the names of humane lawes; so that such other conditions be therein kept as the making of lawes doth require, that is, if they whose authoritie is thereunto required do establish and publish them as lawes. And the truth is, that all our controuersie in this cause concerning the orders of the Church, is what particulars the Church may appoint. That which doth finde them out, is the force of mans reason. That which doth guide and direct his reason, is first the generall law of nature, which law of nature and the morall law of scripture are in the substance of law all one. But because there are also in scripture a number of lawes particular and positiue, which being in force may not by any law of man be violated: we are in making lawes to haue thereunto an especiall eie. As for example, it might perhaps seeme reasonable vnto the Church of God, following the generall laws concerning the nature of mariage, to ordaine in particular that cosen germains shall not marry. Which law notwithstanding ought not to be receiued in the Church, if there should be in the scripture a law particular to the contrary, forbidding vtterly the bonds of mariage to be so far forth abridged. The same Thomas therfore whose definition of humane lawes we mentioned before, doth adde thereunto his caution concerning the rule and canon whereby to make them: Humane lawes are measures in respect of men whose actiōs they must direct; howbeit such measures they are,1.2. q. 95. art. 3. as haue also their higher rules to be measured by, which rules are two, the law of God, and the law of nature. So that laws humane must be made according to the generall lawes of nature, & without contradiction vnto any positiue lawe in scripture. Otherwise they are ill made. Vnto lawes thus made and receiued by a whole Church, they which liue within the bosome of that Church, must not think it a matter indifferēt either to yeeld or not to yeeld obedience. Is it a small offence to despise the Church of God?1. Cor. 11.22. 
               My sonne keepe thy fathers comaundement, saith Salomon,Prou. 6.20. 
               & forget not thy mothers instruction; bind thē bothe alwaies about thine hart. It doth not stand with the duty which we owe to our heauenly fathers, that to the ordinances of our mother the Church we should shew our selues disobedient. Let vs not say we keepe the commandements of the one, when we breake the law of the other: For vnlesse we obserue bothe, we obey neither. And what doth let but that we may obserue both, when they are not the one to the other in any sort repugnant? For of such lawes only we speake, as being made in forme and maner already declared, can haue in them no contradiction vnto the lawes of almighty God. Yea that which is more, the lawes thus made God himselfe doth in such sort authorize, that to despise them is to despise in them him. It is a loose & licentious opinion which the Anabaptists haue embraced, holding that a Christian mans libertie is lost, and the soule which Christ hath redeemed vnto himselfe iniuriously drawne into seruitude vnder the yoke of humane power, if any law be now imposed besides the Gospell of Iesus Christ: in obedience whereunto the spirite of God, and not the constraint of men is to leade vs, according to that of the blessed Apostle, Such as are led by the spirits of God they are the sonnes of God,
               Rom. 8.14. and not such as liue in thraldome vnto men. Their iudgement is therefore that the Church of Christ should admit no law makers but the Euangelists. The author of that which causeth another thing to be, is author of that thing also which thereby is caused. The light of naturall vnderstanding, wit and reason is from God; he it is which thereby doth illuminate euery man entering

into the world. If there proceede from vs any thing afterwardes corrupt and naught, the mother thereof is our owne darknes,Iohn. 1.5. neither doth it proceed from any such cause whereof God is the author. He is the author of all that we think or doe by vertue of that light which himselfe hath giuen. And therefore the lawes which the very Heathens did gather direct their actiōs by,Rom. 1.19. & 2.15. so far forth as they proceeded from the light of nature, God himselfe doth acknowledge to haue proceeded euen from himselfe, and that he was the writer of them in the tables of their hearts. How much more then he the author of those lawes, which haue bene made by his Saints, endued furder with the heauenly grace of his spirit▪ and directed as much as might be with such instructiōs as his sacred word doth yeeld? Surely if we haue vnto those lawes that dutifull regard which their dignitie doth require, it will not greatly need, that we should be exhorted to liue in obedience vnto them. If they haue God himselfe for their author, contempt which is offered vnto them cannot choose but redound vnto him. The safest and vnto God the most acceptable way of framing our liues therfore is, with all humilitie lowlines and singlenes of hart to studie, which way our willing obedience both vnto God and man may be yeelded euen to the vtmost of that which is due.
            10 Touching the mutabilitie of lawes that concerne the regiment & politie of the church, changed they are, when either altogether abrogated,That neither Gods being the author of laws, nor his committing them to scripture, nor the continuance of the end for which they were instituted, is any reason sufficient to proue that they are vnchangeable. or in part repealed or augmented with farther additions. Wherein wee are to note, that this question about changing of lawes, concerneth onely such lawes as are positiue, and do make that now good or euill by being commanded or forbidden, which otherwise of it selfe were not simply the one or the other. Vnto such lawes it is expressely▪ sometimes added, how long they are to continue in force. If this be no where exprest, then haue we no light to direct our iudgemēts concerning the chaungeablenes or immutabilitie of them, but by considering the nature and qualitie of such lawes. The nature of euery lawe must be iudged of by the ende for which it was made, and by the aptnes of thinges therein prescribed vnto the same end. It may so fall out, that the reason why some lawes of God were giuen, is neither opened nor possible to be gathered by wit of man. As why God should forbid Adam that one tree, there was no way for Adam euer to haue certainely vnderstood. And at Adams ignorance of this point Satan tooke aduantage, vrging the more securely a false cause, because the true was vnto Adam vnknowne.Deut. 22.10. Deut. 22.11. Why the Iewes were forbidden to plow their ground with an oxe and an asse, why to cloath themselues with mingled attire of wooll and linnen, both it was vnto them, & vnto vs it remaineth obscure. Such lawes perhaps cannot be abrogated, sauing onely by whom they were made: because the intent of them being knowne vnto none but the author, he alone can iudge how long it is requisite they should endure. But if the reason why things were instituted may be known, and being knowne do appeare manifestly to be of perpetuall necessitie, then are those things also perpetuall, vnlesse they cease to be effectuall vnto that purpose for which they were at the first instituted. Because when a thing doth cease to be auaileable vnto the end which gaue it being, the continuance of it must then of necessitie appeare superfluous. And of this we cannot be ignorant, how sometimes that hath done great good, which afterwardes when time hath chaunged the auncient course of thinges, doth growe to be either very hurtfull, or not

so greatly profitable and necessary. If therefore the end for which a lawe prouideth be perpetually necessary, & the way whereby it prouideth perpetually also most apt, no doubt but that euery such law ought for euer to remain vnchangeable. Whether God be the author of lawes, by authorizing that power of men wherby they are made, or by deliuering them made immediately from himselfe, by word only, or in writing also, or howsoeuer; notwithstāding the authority of their maker, the mutabilitie of that end for which they are made doth also make them changeable. The law of ceremonies came from God. Moses had commandement to commit it vnto the sacred records of scripture, where it continueth euen vnto this very day and houre; in force still as the Iewe surmiseth, because God himselfe was author of it, and for vs to abolish what hee hath established were presumptiō most intollerable. But (that which they in the blindnes of their obdurate hearts are not able to discerne) sith the end for which that lawe was ordained is now fulfilled past and gone; how should it but cease any longer to bee, which hath no longer any cause of being in force as before?Quod pro necessitate temporis statutum est, cessante necessitate debet cessare pariter quod vrgebat. 1. q. 1. Quod pro necessit. 
               That which necessitie of some speciall time doth cause to be inioyned, bindeth no longer thē during that time, but doth afterwards become free. Which thing is also plain, euen by that law which the Apostles assembled at the counsell of Ierusalem did frō thence deliuer vnto the Church of Christ; the preface whereof to authorize it was, To the holy Ghost and to vs it hath seemed good: which stile they did not vse as matching thēselues in power with the holy Ghost, but as testifying the holy Ghost to be the author, and themselues but onely vtterers of that decree.Act. 15. This lawe therefore to haue proceeded from God as the author therof, no faithful man wil denie. It was of God, not only because God gaue thē the power wherby they might make lawes, but for that it proceeded euen frō the holy motion & suggestion of that secret diuine spirit, whose sentence they did but only pronounce. Notwithstanding as the law of ceremonies deliuered vnto the Iews, so this very law which the Gentiles receiued from the mouth of the holy Ghost, is in like respect abrogated by decease of the end for which it was giuen.Counterp. p. 8. But such as do not sticke at this point, such as graunt that what hath bene instituted vpon any special cause needeth not to be obserued that cause ceasing, do notwithstanding herein faile; they iudge the lawes of God onely by the author and maine end for which they were made, so that for vs to change that which he hath established, they hold it execrable pride & presumption, if so be the end and purpose for which God by that meane prouideth bee permanent. And vpon this they ground those ample disputes cōcerning orders and offices, which being by him appointed for the gouernment of his Church, if it be necessary alwaies that the Church of Christ be gouerned, then doth the end for which God prouided remaine still; and therefore in those means which he by law did establish as being fittest vnto that end, for vs to alter any thing is to lift vp our selues against God, and as it were to countermaund him. Wherin they marke not that laws are instruments to rule by, and that instruments are not only to be framed according vnto the generall ende for which they are prouided, but euē according vnto that very particular which riseth out of the matter wheron they haue to worke. The end wherefore lawes were made may be permanent, and those lawes neuerthelesse require some alteration, if there be any vnfitnes in the meanes which they prescribe as tending vnto that end & purpose.

As for exāple, a law that to bridle the
                  ••
                doth punish the ones with a quadruple 
                  •
               estitution, hath an end which wil cōtinue as long as the world it self cōtinueth. Theft will be alwayes, and will alwayes need to be bridled▪ But that the meane which this law prouideth for that end▪ namely the punishment of quadruple restitution, that this will be alwaies sufficient to bridle and restraine that kind of enormity, no man can warrant. Insufficiency of lawes doth somtimes come by want of iudgement in the makers. Which cause cannot fall into any law termed properly and immediatly diuine, as it may and doth into humaine lawes often. But that which hath bene once most sufficient, may wax otherwise by alteratiō of time & place; that punishment which hath bene somtimes forcible to bridle sinne, may grow afterwards too weake and feeble. In a word we plainely perceiue by the difference of those three lawes which the Iewes receiued at the hands of God, the morall, ceremoniall, & iudiciall, that if the end for which, and the matter according whereunto God maketh his lawes, continue alwaies one and the same▪ his laws also do the like; for which cause the morall law cannot be altered: secondly that whether the matter wheron lawes are made continue or cōtinue not, if their end haue once ceased, they cease also to be of force; as in the law ceremonial it fareth: finally that albeit the end cōtinue, as in that law of theft specified, and in a great part of those ancient iudicials it doth; yet for as mush as there is not in all respects the same subiect or matter remaining for which they were first instituted, euen this is sufficient cause of change. And therefore lawes though both ordeined of God himselfe▪ and the end for which they were ordeined continuing▪ may notwithstanding cease▪ if by alteration of persons or times they be foūd vnsufficiēt to attain vnto that end. In which respect why may we not presume, that God doth euē call for such change or alteratiō, as the very cō
               dition of things thēselues doth make necessary? They which do therfore plead the authority of the law-maker▪ as an argument wherefore it should not be lawfull to change that which he hath instituted▪ and will haue this the cause why all the ordinances of our Sauiour are immutable▪ they which vrge the wisdome of God as a proofe, that whatsoeuer laws he hath made they ought to stand, 
                  •
               nlesse himselfe from heauen proclaime them disanuld▪ because it is not in man to correct the ordināce of God; may know, if it please thē to take notice therof, that we are far frō presuming to think that mē can better any thing which God hath done, euē as we are from thinking that mē should presume to vndo some things of men, which God doth know they cannot better. God neuer ordeined any thing that could be bettered. Yet many things he hath, that haue bene changed, and that for the better. That which succeedeth as better now whē change is requisite, had bin worse when that which now is changed was instituted. Otherwise God had not then left this to choose that, neither would now reiect that to choose this, were it not for some new grown occasion making that which hath bene better worse. In this case therefore 
                  〈…〉
                not presume to change Gods ordinance▪ but they yeeld thereunto requiring it selfe to be chaunged. Against this it is obiected, that to abrogate or innouate the gospel of Christ, if mē do Angels should attempt, it were most heynous and cursed sacriledge. And the Gospell as they say containeth not only doctrine instructing men how they should beleeue, but also precepts concerning the regiment of the Church▪ Discipline

therefore is a part of the Gospell; and God being the author of the whole Gospel,We offer to shew the discipline to bee a parte of the Gospell, and therfore to haue a cōmon cause: so that in the repulse of the discipline, the Gospell receiue
                     •
                   a checke. And againe, I speake of the discipline as of a part of the Gospell, and therfore neither vnder nor aboue the Gospel, but the Gospell▪
                as well of discipline as of doctrine, it cānot be but that both of them haue a common cause. So that as we are to beleeue for euer the articles of euangelicall doctrine, so the precepts of discipline we are in like sort bound for euer to obserue. Touching points of doctrine, as for example the vnity of God, the trinitie of persons, saluation by Christ, the resurrection of the body, life euerlasting, the iudgement to come, and such like, they haue bene since the first houre that there was a Church in the world, and till the last they must be beleeued. But as for matters of regiment, they are for the most part of another nature. To make new articles of faith and doctrine no man thinketh it lawfull; new lawes of gouernment what common wealth or Church is there which maketh not either at one time or another? The rule of faith, saith Tertullian, is but one and that alone immoueable, and impossible to be framed or cast anew. The law of outward order & polity not so. There is no reason in the world wherfore we should esteeme it as necessary alwayes to do, as alwayes to beleeue the same things; seeing euery man knoweth that the matter of faith is constant,T.C. l. 2. p. 1.4. Tertul. de veland virg. the matter contrariwise of action daily changeable, especially the matter of action belonging vnto Church polity. Neither than I find that men of soundest iudgement haue any otherwise taught,Ma
                     •
                  t. in 1. then that articles of beliefe,Sam. 14. and things which all men must of necessity do to the end they may be saued, are either expresly set downe in Scripture, or else plainly thereby to be gathered. But touching things which belong to discipline & outward politie,Act. 15. the Church hath authority to make canons, laws, & decrees, euen as we reade that in the Apostles times it did. Which kind of lawes (for as much as they are not in themselues necessary to saluation) may after they are made be also changed as the difference of times or places shall require. Yea it is not denied I am sure by themselues, that certaine things in discipline are of that nature, as they may be varied by times, places, persons and other the like circumstances. Whereupon I demaund, are those changeable points of discipline commaunded in the word of God, or no? If they be not commanded, and yet may be receiued in the Church; how can their former position stand, cōdemning all things in the Church which in the word are not commanded? If they be commaunded, and yet may suffer change▪ how can this later stand, affirming all things immutable which are commanded of God? Their distinction touching matters of substance and of circumstance, though true, will not serue. For be they great things or be they small, if God haue commaunded them in the Gospell, and his commanding them in the Gospell do make them vnchangeable, there is no reason we should more change the one then we may the other. If the authority of the maker do proue vnchangeablenesse in the lawes which God hath made; then must al laws which he hath made be necessarily for euer permanēt, though they be but of circumstance only and not of substance. I therfore conclude, that neither Gods being author of lawes for gouernment of his Church, nor his cō
               mitting▪ them vnto Scripture, is any reason sufficient, wherefore all Churches should for euer be bound to keepe them without chaunge. But of one thing we are here to giue them warning by the way. For whereas in this discourse we haue oftentimes profest, that many parts of discipline or Church politie are deliuered in Scripture, they may perhaps imagine that we are driuē to cōfesse their

discipline to be deliuered in scripture, and that hauing no other meanes to auoid it, we are faine to argue for the changeablenesse of lawes ordained euen by God himselfe, as if otherwise theirs of necessitie should take place, and that vnder which we liue be abandoned▪ There is no remedie therefore but to abate this error in them, and directly to let them know, that if they fall into any such conceit, they do but a little flatter their owne cause. As for vs, we thinke in no respect so highly of it. Our perswasion is, that no age euer had knowledged of it but onely ours; that they which defend it, deuised it; that neither Christ nor his Apostles at any time taught it but the contrary. If therefore we did seeke to maintaine that which most aduantageth our owne cause, the very best way for vs, and the strongest against them, were to hold euen as they do, that in Scripture there must needs be foūd some particular forme of Church-polity, which God hath instituted, and which Disciplin

But with any such partiall eye to respect our selues, and by cunning to make those things seeme the truest which are the fittest to serue our purpose, is a thing which we neither like nor meane to follow. Wherefore that which we take to be generally true concerning the mutability of lawes, the same we haue plainely deliuered; as being perswaded of nothing more then we are of this, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  h. 10. c. 1. that whether it be in matter of speculation or of practise, no vntruth can possibly auaile the patrone and defendor long, and that things most truly are likewise most behoouefully spoken.
            11. This we hold and graunt for truth, that those very lawes which of their own nature are changeable, be notwithstāding vncapable of change, if he which gaue them, being of authority so to do, forbid absolutely to change thē; neither may they admit alteratiō against the will of such a law maker.VVhether Christ haue forbidden all chaunge of those lawes which are set downe in Scripture. Albeit therfore we do not find any cause, why of right there should be necessarily an immutable forme set downe in holy scripture; neuerthelesse if indeed there haue bene at any time a Church-politie so set downe, the change whereof the sacred scripture doth forbid, surely for mē to alter those lawes which God for perpetuity hath established, were presumption most intollerable. To proue therfore that the wil of Christ was to establish laws so permanent and immutable, that in any sort to alter them cannot but highly offend God, thus they reason. First if Moses being but a seruant in the house of God, did therin establish lawes of gouernmēt for perpetuity,Heb. 1.6. Either that commendation of the son before the seruant is a false testimony, or the sonne ordained a permanent gouernment in the Church. 
                     •
                  f parmanent, then not to be changed. VVhat then do they that hold it may be changed at the magistrates pleasure, but aduise the magistrate by his positiue lawes to proclaime that it is his will, that if there shall be a Church within his dominions, he will maime and deforme the same. M.M. p. 16. He that was as faithfull as Moses, left as cleare instruction for the gouernment of the Church. But Christ was as faithfull as Moses. Ergo. Demonst▪ of Disc. cap. 1. lawes which they that were of the houshold might not alter: shall we admit into our thoughts, that the sonne of God hath in prouiding for this his houshold declared himselfe lesse faithfull then Moses? Moses deliuering vnto the Iewes such lawes as were durable; if those be changeable which Christ hath deliuered vnto vs, we are not able to auoide it, but (that which to thinke were heinous impiety) we of necessity must confesse, euen the sonne of God himselfe to haue bene lesse faithfull then Moses. Which argument shall need no touchstone to try it by, but some other of the like making. Moses erected in the wildernes a tabernacle, which was moueable from place to place; Salomon a sumptuous & stately Temple, which was not moueable: Therfore

               Salomon was faithfuller then Moses; which no man indued with reason will thinke. And yet by this reasō it doth plainly follow. He that wil see how faithful the one or the other was, must cōpare the things which they bothe did; vnto the charge which God gaue each of them▪ The Apostle in making comparison betweene our Sauiour and Moses, attributeth faithfulnes vnto bothe, and maketh this difference betweene them; Moses in, but Christ ouer the house of God; Moses in that house which was his by charge and commission, though to gouerne it, yet to gouerne it as a seruant; but Christ ouer this house, as being his owne intire possesion.
               Iohn. 17. Our Lord and Sauiour doth make protestation, I haue giuen vnto them the words which thou gauest me. Faithfull therefore he was, and concealed not any part of his fathers will. But did any part of that will require the immutability of lawes concerning Church-polity? They answer, yea. For else God should lesse fauour vs then the Iewes.Either God hath left a prescript forme of gouernement now▪ or else he is lesse carefull vnder the new test
                     •
                  mēt then vnder the olde Demonst. of Disc. cap. 1. God would not haue their Churches guided by any lawes but his owne. And seeing this did so continue euen till Christ; now to ease God of that care, or rather to depriue the Church of his patronage, what reason haue we? Surely none to derogate any thing from the ancient loue which God hath borne to his Church. An heathen Philosopher there is, who considering how many things beasts haue which men haue not, how naked in comparison of them, how impotent, and how much lesse able we are to shift for our selues along time after we enter into this world, repiningly concluded hereupon, that nature being a carefull mother for them, is towards vs a hard harted Stepdame. No, we may not measure the affection of our gratious God towards his by such differences. For euen herein shineth his wisdome, that though the wayes of his prouidence be many, yea the ende which he bringeth all at the length vnto, is one and the selfe same. But if such kind of reasoning were good, might we not euen as directly conclude the very same concerning laws of secular regiment?Ecclesiast. disc. lib. 1▪
                Their owne words are these. In the ancient Church of the Iewes, God did command, and Moses commit vnto writing, all things pertinent as well to the ciuil as to the Ecclesiasticall state. God gaue them lawes of ciuill regiment, and would not permit their common weale to be gouerned by any other lawes then his owne. Doth God lesse regard our temporal estate in this world, or prouide for it worse then for theirs? To vs notwithstanding he hath not as to them deliuered any particular forme of temporall regiment, vnlesse perhaps we thinke, as some do, that the grafting of the Gentiles & their incorporating into Israell,Rom. 1
                     •
                  .17. doth import that we ought to be subiect vnto the rites and lawes of their whole politie. We see then how weake such disputes are,Eph. 
                     •
                  12.16. & how smally they make to this purpose. That Christ did not meane to set downe particular positiue lawes for all things in such sort as Moses did, the very different manner of deliuering the lawes of Moses and the lawes of Christ doth plainly shew. Moses had commaundement to gather the ordinances of God together distinctly, and orderly to set them downe according vnto their seuerall kinds, for each publique duty and office the laws that belong thereto, as appeareth in the bookes themselues written of purpose for that end. Contrariwise the lawes of Christ we find rather mentioned by occasion in the writings of the Apostles, then any solemne thing directly written to comprehend them in legall sort. Againe the positiue lawes which Moses gaue, they were giuen for the greatest part with restraint to the

land of Iurie; Behold sayth Moses, I haue taught you ordinances and lawes as the Lord my God commaunded me,
               Deut. 4.5. 
               that ye should do euen so within the land whither ye go to possesse it. Which lawes and ordinances positiue he plainely distinguisheth afterward from the lawes of the two Tables which were morall; The Lord spake vnto you out of the midst of the fire, ye heard the voyce of the words, but saw no similitude,
               Verse 12. 
               onely a voyce. Then he declared vnto you his Couenant which he commaunded you to do,
               Verse 13. 
               the ten Commaundements, and wrote them vpon two Tables of stone.
               Verse 14. 
               And the Lord commaunded me that same time, that I should teach you ordinances and lawes which ye should obserue in the land whither ye go to possesse it. The same difference is againe set downe in the next Chapter following. For rehearsall being made of the ten Commaundements, it followeth immediatly;Deut. 5.22. 
               These words the Lord spake vnto all your multitude in the Mount out of the midst of the fire, the cloude and the darknesse, with a great voyce, and added no more, and wrote them vpon two Tables of stone, and deliuered them vnto me. But concerning other lawes, the people giue their consent to receiue them at the hands of Moses; Go thou neerer,
               Deut. 27. 
               and heare all that the Lord our God sayth, and declare thou vnto vs all that the Lord our God sayth vnto thee, and we will heare it and do it. The peoples alacritie herein God highly commendeth with most effectuall and heartie speech;Deut. 28. 
               I haue heard the voyce of the wordes of this people, they haue spoken well.
               Deut. 23. 
               O that there were such an heart in them to feare me, and to keepe all my Commaundements alwayes, that it might go well with them, and with their children for euer! Go say vnto them▪
               
               Deut. 30. 
               Returne you to your tents; But stand thou here with me,
               Deut. 31. 
               and I will tell thee all the Commaundements and the Ordinances and the Lawes which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I haue giuen them to possesse. From this later kind the former are plainely distinguished in many things. They were not bothe at one time deliuered, neither bothe after one sort, nor to one end. The former vttered by the voyce of God himselfe in the hearing of sixe hundred thousand men; the former written with the finger of God; the former tearmed by the name of a Couenant; the former giuen to be kept without either mention of time how long, or of place where. On the other side the later giuen after, and neither written by God himselfe, nor giuen vnto the whole multitude immediatly from God, but vnto Moses, and from him to them both by word and writing; the later tearmed Ceremonies. Iudgements, Ordinances, but no where Couenants; finally the obseruation of the later restrained vnto the land where God would establish them to inhabite. The Lawes positiue are not framed without regard had to the place and persons for the which they are made. If therefore Almightie God in framing their Lawes, had an eye vnto the nature of that people, and to the countrey where they were to dwell; if these peculiar and proper considerations were respected in the making of their Lawes, and must be also regarded in the Positiue Lawes of all other Nations besides; then seeing that Nations are not all alike, surely the giuing of one kinde of positiue Lawes vnto one onely people, without anie libertie to alter them, is but a slender proofe, that therefore one kind should in like sort bee giuen to serue euerlastingly for all. But that which most of all maketh for the cleering of this point is, that the Iewes who had Lawes so particularly

determining and so fully instructing them in all affaires what to do, were notwithstanding continually inured with causes exorbitant, and such as their lawes had not prouided for.T.C. l. 1. p. 35. Whereas you say that they (the Iewes) had nothing, but was determined by the law, and we haue manie things vndetermined and left to the order of the Church: I will offer for one that you shall bring that we haue left to the order of the Church, to shew you that they had twentie which were vndecided of by the expresse word of God.
                And in this point much more is graunted vs then wee aske, namely that for one thing which we haue left to the order of the Church; they had twentie which were vndecided by the expresse word of God; and that as their ceremonies and Sacraments were multiplied aboue ours, euen so grew the number of those cases which were not determined by any expresse word. So that if we may deuise one lawe, they by this reason might deuise twentie: and if their deuising so many were not forbidden, shall their example proue vs forbidden to deuise as much as one lawe for the ordering of the Church? Wee might not deuise no not one, if their example did proue that our Sauiour hath vtterly forbidden all alteration of his lawes, in as much as there can be no lawe deuised, but needs it must either take away from his, or adde thereunto more or lesse, and so make some kind of alteration. But of this so large a graunt we are content not to take aduantage. Men are oftentimes in a sudden passion more liberall, then they would be if they had leysure to take aduise. And therefore so bountifull words of course and franke speeches we are contented to let passe, without turning them vnto aduantage with too much rigour. It may be they had rather be listned vnto, when they commend the Kings of Israell which attempted nothing in the gouernement of the Church without the expresse word of God;T.C. in the table to his second booke. and when they vrge that God left nothing in his word vndescribed,T.C. l. 2. p. 446 If he will needs separate the worship of God from the externall politie; yet as the Lord set forth the one, so he left nothing vndescribed in the other.
                whether it concerned the worship of God or outward politie, nothing vnset downe, and therefore charged them strictly to keepe themselues vnto that, without any alteration. Howbeit seeing it cannot be denied, but that many thinges there did belong vnto the course of their publique affaires, wherein they had no expresse word at all to shew precisely what they should do; the difference betweene their condition and ours in these cases, will bring some light vnto the truth of this present controuersie. Before the fact of the son of Shelomith, there was no law which did appoint any certaine punishment for blasphemers.Leuit, 24.12. That wretched creature being therefore deprehended in that impiety, was held in ward, till the mind of the Lord were knowne concerning his case. The like practise is also mētioned vpon occasion of a breach of the Sabboth day. They find a poore silly creature gathering stickes in the wildernes,Numb. 15.34. they bring him vnto Moses and Aaron and all the congregation, they lay him in hold, because it was not declared what should be done with him, till God hath sayd vnto Moses, This man shall dye the death. The Law required to keepe the Sabboth; but for the breach of the Sabboth what punishmēt should be inflicted it did not appoint. Such occasions as these are rare. And for such things as do fal scarce once in many ages of mē, it did suffice to take such order as was requisite when they fell. But if the case were such as being not already determined by law, were notwithstanding likely oftentimes to come in question, it gaue occasion of adding lawes that were not before. Thus it fell out in the case of those men polluted,Numb. 9. Numb. 27. and of the daughters of Zelophhad; whose causes Moses hauing brought before the Lord, receiued lawes to serue for the like in time to come. The Iewes to this end had the Oracle of God, they had the Prophets: And by such meanes God himselfe instructed them from heauen what to do, in all

things that did greatly concerne their state, and were not already set downe in the Lawe. Shall we then hereupon argue euen against our owne experience and knowledge? Shall we seeke to perswade men, that of necessity it is with vs as it was with them, that because God is ours in all respects as much as theirs, therefore either no such way of direction hath beene at any time, or if it haue bene, it doth still continue in the Church, or if the same do not continue, that yet it must be at the least supplied by some such meane as pleaseth vs to accompt of equall force? A more dutifull and religious way for vs were, to admire the wisedome of God, which shineth in the beautifull variety of all things; but most in the manifold and yet harmonious dissimilitude of those wayes, whereby his Church vpon earth is guided from age to age throughout all generations of men.Gen. 18.18. The Iewes were necessarily to continue till the comming of Christ in the flesh, and the gathering of nations vnto him.Gen. 48.10. So much the promise made vnto Abraham did import. So much the prophecy of Iacob at the hower of his death did foreshewe. Vpon the 
                  •
               afety therefore of their very outward state and condition for so long, the after-good of the whole world, and the saluation of all did depend. Vnto their so long safety for two things it was necessary to prouide, namely the preseruation of their state against forraine resistance, and the continuance of their peace within themselues. Touching the one, as they receiued the promise of God to be the rocke of their defence, against which who so did violently rush, should but bruse and batter themselues; so likewise they had his commaundement in all their affaires that way, to seeke direction and counsell from him. Mens consultations are alwayes perilous. And it falleth out many times that after long deliberation, those things are by their wit euen resolued on, which by tryall are found most opposite to publique safety. It is no impossible thing for states, be they neuer so well established, yet by ouersight in some one acte or treatie betweene them and their potent opposites, vtterly to cast away themselues for euer. Wherefore least it should so fall out to them, vpon whom so much did depend; they were not permitted to enter into warre, nor conclude any league of peace, nor to wade through any acte of moment betweene them and forraine states, vnlesse the Oracle of God or his Prophets were first consulted with. And least domesticall disturbance should wash them within themselues, because there was nothing vnto this purpose more effectuall, then if the authority of their lawes and gouernors were such, as none might presume to take exception against it, or to shewe disobedience vnto it, without incurring the hatred & detestation of al men that had any sparke of the feare of God; therefore he gaue them euen their positiue lawes from heauen, and as oft as occasion required, chose in like sort Rulers also to leade & gouerne them. Notwithstāding some desperatly impious there were, which adventured to try what harme it could bring vpon them, if they did attempt to be authors of confusion, and to resist both Gouernours and Lawes. Against such monsters God mainteined his owne by fearefull execution of extraordinarie iudgement vpon them. By which meanes it came to passe, that although they were a people infested and mightily hated of all others throughout the world, although by nature hard harted, querulous, wrathful & impatiēt of rest and quietnes, yet was there nothing of force either one way or other to

worke the ruine and subuersion of their state, till the time before mentioned was expired. Thus we see that there was not no cause of dissimilitude in these things, betweene that one only people before Christ, and the kingdomes of the world since.T.C. lib. 
                     •
                  . pag. 440. And whereas it is further alleaged, that albeit in Ciuill matters and things perteining to this present life, God hath vsed a greater particularity with them then amongst vs, framing lawes according to the quality of that people and Countrey; yet the leauing of vs at greater liberty in things ciuill, is so farre from prouing the like liberty in things pertaining to the kingdome of heauen, that it rather proues a streighter bond. For euen as when the Lord would haue his fauour more appeare by temporall blessings of this life towards the people vnder the Lawe then towards vs, he gaue also politique lawes most exactly, whereby they might both most easily come into, and most stedfastly remaine in possession of those earthly benefites: euen so at this time, wherein he would not haue his fauour so much esteemed by those outward commodities, it is required, that as his care in prescribing lawes for that purpose hath somewhat fallen, in leauing them to mens consultations which may be deceiued; so his care for conduct and gouernement of the life to come, should (if it were possible) rise, in leauing lesse to the order of men then in times past. These are but weake and feeble disputes for the inference of that conclusion which is intended. For sauing only in such consideration as hath bene shewed, there is no cause wherefore we should thinke God more desirous to manifest his fauour by temporall blessings towards them, then towards vs. Godlinesse had vnto them, and it hath also vnto vs, the promises both of this life and the life to come. That the care of God hath fallen in earthly things, and therefore should rise as much in heauenly; that more is left vnto mens consultations in the one, and therefore lesse must be graunted in the other; that God hauing vsed a greater particularity with them then with vs for matters perteining vnto this life, is to make vs amends by the more exact deliuery of lawes for gouernment of the life to come; these are proportions, whereof if there be any rule, we must plainely confesse that which truth is, we know it not. God which spake vnto them by his Prophets, hath vnto vs by his onely begotten Sonne; those mysteries of grace and saluation which were but darkely disclosed vnto them, haue vnto vs more cleerely shined. Such differences betweene them and vs the Apostles of Christ haue well acquainted vs withall. But as for matter belonging to the outward cōduct or gouernment of the Church; seeing that euen in sense it is manifest, that our Lord & Sauiour hath not by positiue lawes descended so farre into particularities with vs, as Moses with them; neither doth by extraordinary means, oracles, and Prophets, direct vs, as them he did, in those things which rising daily by new occasions, are of necessitie to be prouided for; doth it not hereupon rather follow, that although not to them, yet to vs there should be freedome & libertie graunted to make lawes?1. Tim. 6.14. Yea but the Apostle S. Paule doth fearefully charge Timothy, euen In the sight of God who quickneth all, & of Christ Iesus who witnessed that famous confession before Pontius Pilate,
               Iohn. 18.37. 
               to keepe what was commaunded him safe and sound til the appearance of our Lord Iesus Christ. This doth exclude al liberty of changing the lawes of Christ, whether by abrogation or addition, or howsoeuer. For in Timothy the whole Church of Christ receiueth charge concerning her duty. And that charge is to keepe the Apostles commaundement: And his commaundement did conteine the lawes that concerned Church gouernement:

And those lawes he straightly requireth to be obserued without breach or blame, till the appearance of our Lord Iesus Christ. In Scripture we graunt euery one mans lesson, to be the common instruction of all men, so farre forth as their cases are like, and that religiously to keepe the Apostles commandemēts in whatsoeuer they may concerne vs, we all stand bound. But touching that commandement which Timothy was charged with, we swarue vndoubtedly from the Apostles precise meaning, if we extend it so largely, that the armes thereof shall reach vnto all things which were cōmanded him by the Apostle. The very words themselues do restraine thēselues vnto some one speciall commandemēt among many. And therfore it is not said, Keepe the ordinances, lawes & constitutions which thou hast receiued, but 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               that great cōmandement, which doth principally concerne thee and thy calling;Iohn. 21.15. that cōmandement which Christ did so often inculcate vnto Peter; that cōmandement vnto the carefull discharge whereof they of Ephesus are exhorted, Attend to your selues & to all flock,
               Act. 20.28. 
               wherin the holy Ghost hath placed you Bishops, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased by his owne bloud; finally that cōmandement which vnto the same Timothy is by the same Apostle euen in the same forme & maner afterwards again vrged,2. Tim. 4.1. 
               I charge thee in the sight of God, & the Lord Iesus Christ, which will iudge the quicke & dead at his appearance & in his kingdom, Preach the word of God. When Timothy was instituted into that office, then was the credit and trust of this duty committed vnto his faithfull care.1. Tim. 6.20. The doctrine of the Gospell was thē giuen him, as the precious talent or treasure of Iesus Christ; then receiued he for performance of this duty,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               the special gift of the holy Ghost. To keepe this cōmandement immaculate and blamelesse,1. Tim. 4.14. 
               was to teach the Gospel of Christ without mixture of corrupt & vnsound doctrine, such as a number did euen in those times intermingle with the misteries of Christian beliefe. Til the appearance of Christ to keep it so, doth not import the time wherein it shold be kept, but rather the time whereunto the finall reward for keeping it was reserued: according to that of S. Paul concerning himselfe, I haue kept the faith;
               2. Tim. 4.7. 
               for the residue there is laid vp for me a crowne of righteousnes, which the Lord the righteous shall in that day render vnto me. If they that labour in this haruest should respect but the present fruit of their painefull trauell, a poore incouragement it were vnto them to continue therein al the daies of their life. But their reward is great in heauen; the crowne of righteousnes which shalbe giuen them in that day is honorable. The fruite of their industry then shall they reape with full contentment and satisfaction, but not till then. Wherein the greatnes of their reward is abundantly sufficient, to counteruaile the tediousnesse of their expectation. Wherefore till then they that are in labour must rest in hope. O Timothie, keepe that which is committed vnto thy charge, that great commandement which thou hast receiued keepe, till the appearance of our Lord Iesus Christ. In which sense although we iudge the Apostles words to haue bene vttered; yet hereunto we do not require them to yeeld, that thinke any other construction more sound. If therefore it be reiected, and theirs esteemed more probable which hold that the last wordes doe import perpetuall obseruation of the Apostles commaundement imposed necessarilly for euer vppon the militant Church of Christ; let them withall consider that then his commaundement cannot so largely bee taken, as to comprehend whatsoeuer the Apostle did commaund Timothy. For

themselues do not all blind the Church vnto some things whereof Timothy receiued charge,1. Tim. 5.9. as namely vnto that precept concerning the choise of Widowes. So as they cannot hereby maintaine, that all things positiuely commanded concerning the affaires of the Church, were commanded for perpetuitie. And we do not deny, that certaine things were commanded to be, though positiue, yet perpetuall in the Church. They should not therefore vrge against vs places that seeme to forbid change, but rather such as set downe some measure of alteration; which measure if we haue exceeded, then might they therwith charge vs iustly: Whereas now they themselues both granting, and also vsing liberty to change, cannot in reason dispute absolutely against al change. Christ deliuered no inconuenient or vnmeete lawes. Sundry of ours they hold inconuenient. Therefore such lawes they cannot possibly hold to be Christs. Being not his, they must of necessity graunt them added vnto his. Yet certaine of those very lawes so added, they themselues do not iudge vnlawfull; as they plainly confesse, both in matter of prescript attire, and of rites appertaining to buriall. Their owne protestations are that they plead against the inconuenience, not the vnlawfulnes of popish apparell; and against the inconuenience, not the vnlawfulnesse of Ceremonies in Buriall. Therefore they hold it a thing not vnlawfull to adde to the lawes of Iesus Christ;T.C. l. 3. pa. 241. My reasons do neuer conclude the vnlawfulnes of these ceremonies of buriall, but the inconuenience and inexpediente of them. And in the Table: Of the inconuenience, not of th
                        •
                      vnlawfulnes of popish apparell and ceremonies in buriall.
                and so consequently they yeeld, that no lawe of Christ forbiddeth addition vnto Church laws. The iudgement of Caluin being alleaged against them,T.C. l. 1. p. 32. Vpon the indefinite speaking of M. Caluin, saying, ceremonies and externall discipline without adding all or some, you go about subtilly to make men believe, that M. Caluin had placed the whole externall discipline in the power and arbiterment of the Church. For if all externall discipline were arbitrary and in the choise of the Church, Excommunication also (which is a part of it) might be cast away, which I thinke you will not say. And in the very next words before. Where you would giue to vnderstand that ceremonies & externall discipline are not prescribed particularly by the word of God, and therfore left to the order of the Church: you must vnderstand that all externall discipline is not left to the order of the Church, being particularly prescribed in the Scripture
                        •
                     : no more then all ceremonies are left to the order of the Church, as the sacrament of Baptisms, and Supper of the Lord.
                to whom of all men they attribute most, whereas his words be plaine, that for Ceremonies and externall discipline the Church hath power to make lawes: the answer which herunto they make is, that indefinitly the speech is true, and that so it was meant by him, namely that some things belonging vnto externall discipline and Ceremonies, are in the power and arbitrement of the Church; but neither was it mēt, neither is it true generally, that al externall discipline, & all Ceremonies are left to the order of the Church, in as much as the sacraments of Baptisme & the Supper of the Lord are Ceremonies, which yet the Church may not therefore abrogate. Againe, excommunication is a part of externall discipline; which might also be cast away, if all externall discipline were arbitrary, and in the choise of the Church. By which their answer it doth appeare, that touching the names of Ceremonie and externall discipline, they gladly would haue vs so vnderstood, as if we did herein conteine a great deale more then we do. The fault which we find with them is, that they ouermuch abridge the Church of her power in these things. Whereupon they recharge vs, as if in these things we gaue the Church a liberty which hath no limits or boūds; as if all things which the name of discipline cōteineth, were at the churches free choice, so that we might either haue Church-gouernours and gouernement or want them, either reteine or reiect Church censures as we list. They wonder at vs, as at men which thinke it so indifferent what the Church doth in

matter of ceremonies, that it may bee feared least we iudge the very sacraments themselues to be held at the Churches pleasure. No, the name of ceremonies we do not vse in so large a meaning as to bring Sacraments within the compasse and reach thereof; although things belonging vnto the outward forme and seemely administration of them, are conteined in that name, euen as we vse it. For the name of ceremonies we vse as they themselues do,T.C. l. 3. p. 171. when they speake after this sort: The Doctrine and Discipline of the Church, as the waightiest things, ought especially to be looked vnto; but the Ceremonies also, as mynt & comyn, ought not to be neglected. Besides in the matter of externall discipline or regiment itselfe, wee doe not deny but there are some thinges whereto the Church is bound till the worlds ende. So as the question is onely howe farre the bounds of the Churches libertie do reach. We hold that the power which the Church hath lawfully to make lawes and orders for it selfe, doth extend vnto sundrie things of Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction and such other matters, whereto their opinion is, that the Churches authoritie and power doth not reach. Whereas therefore in disputing against vs about this point, they take their compasse a great deale wider then the truth of things can afford, producing reasons and arguments by way of generality, to proue that Christ hath set downe all things belonging any way vnto the forme of ordering his Church, and hath absolutely forbidden change by addition or diminution great or small (for so their maner of disputing is:) we are constrained to make our defence, by shewing that Christ hath not depriued his Church so farre of all libertie in making orders & lawes for it selfe, and that they themselues do not thinke he hath so done. For are they able to shew that all particular customes, rites and orders of reformed Churches, haue bene appointed by Christ himselfe? No, they graunt that in matter of circumstance they alter that which they haue receiued;T.C. l. 1. p. 27. We deny not but certaine things are left to the order of the Church▪ because they are of the nature of those which are varied by times, places, persons, and other circumstances, & so could not at one be set downe and established for ever.
                but in things of substance they keepe the lawes of Christ without change. If we say the same in our owne behalfe, (which surely we may do with a great deale more truth) then must they cancell all that hath bene before alleaged, and beginne to inquire a fresh, whether we reteine the lawes that Christ hath deliuered concerning matters of substance, yea or no. For our constant perswasion in this point is as theirs, that we haue no where altered the lawes of Christ, further then in such particularities onely as haue the nature of things chaungeable according to the difference of times, places, persons, and other the like circumstances. Christ hath commaunded prayers to be made, sacraments to be ministred, his Church to be carefully taught and guided. Concerning euery of these somewhat Christ hath commaunded which must bee kept till the worlds end. On the contrary side in euery of thē somewhat there may be added, as the Church shall iudge it expedient. So that if they will speake to purpose, all which hitherto hath bene disputed of they must giue ouer, and stand vpon such particulars onely as they can shew we haue either added or abrogated otherwise then we ought, in the matter of Church politie. Whatsoeuer Christ hath commanded for euer to be kept in his Church, the same we take not vpon vs to abrogate; and whatsoeuer our lawes haue thereunto added besides, of such qualitie we hope it is, as no law of Christ doth any where condemne. Wherefore that all may be layd together, and gathered into a narrower roome.  1. First so farre

forth as the Church is the mysticall body of Christ and his inuisible spouse, it needeth no externall politie. That very part of the law diuine which teacheth faith and workes of righteousnesse, is it selfe alone sufficient for the Church of God in that respect. But as the Church is a visible society and body politique, lawes of politie it cannot want.  2. Whereas therfore it commeth in the second place to be inquired, what lawes are fittest and best for the Church; they who first embraced that rigorous and strict opinion, which depriueth the Church of liberty to make any kind of law for her selfe, inclined as it should seeme thereunto,Esa. 29.14. Col. 2.22. for that they imagined all things, which the Church doth without commandement of holy scripture, subiect to that reproofe which the scripture it self vseth in certaine cases, when diuine authority ought alone to be followed. Herupon they thought it inough for the cācelling of any kind of order whatsoeuer, to say, The word of God teacheth it not, it is a deuise of the braine of man, away with it therefore out of the Church.
               Aug. Epist. 26. 
               S. Augustine was of another mind, who speaking of fasts on the Sunday saith, That he which would chuse out that day to fast on, should giue therby no small offence to the Church of God, which had receiued a contrary custome. For in these things wherof the scripture appointeth no certainty, the vse of the people of God, or the ordinances of our Fathers must serue for a law. In which case if we will dispute, and condemne one sort by anothers custome, it will be but matter of endlesse contention; where, for as much as the labour of reasoning shal hardly beate into mens heads any certaine or necessary truth, surely it standeth vs vpō to take heed, least with the tempest of strife the brightnesse of charity and loue be darkened.
               Ios. 22. If all things must bee commaunded of God which may be practised of his Church, I would know what commaundement the Gileadites had to erect that Altar which is spokē of in the booke of Iosua. Did not cōgruity of reason induce them therunto, & suffice for defence of their fact? I would know what cōmandement the women of Israel had yearly to mourne and lament in the memorie of Iephtaes daughter;Iud. 11.40. 
                     •
                  oh. 10.22. what cōmandement the Iewes had to celebrate their feast of Dedication neuer spoken of in the law, yet solemnized euen by our Sauior himselfe;Ioh. 19.40. what cōmandement finally they had for the ceremony of odors vsed about the bodies of the dead, after which custome notwithstanding (sith it was their custome) our Lord was contented that his owne most pretious should be intoombd. Wherfore io reiect all orders of the Church which men haue established, is to thinke worse of the laws of men in this respect, then either the iudgement of wisemen alloweth, or the law of God it selfe will beare. Howbeit they which had once takē vpon thē to condemn all things done in the Church, & not cōmanded of God to be done, saw it was necessary for thē (cōtinuing in defence of this their opiniō) to hold that needs there must be in scripture set down a cōplete particular forme of Church polity, a forme prescribing how al the affaires of the church must be ordered, a form in no respect lawful to be altered by mortal mē. For reformatiō of which ouersight & error in thē, there were that thought it a part of Christian loue & charity to instruct thē better, & to open vnto thē the diference betweene matters of perpetual necessity to all mens saluation, and matters of Ecclesiasticall politie: the one both fully and plainly taught in holy scripture, the other not necessary to be in such sort there prescribed; the one not capable of any diminution or augmentation at all by men, the other apt to admit bothe. Herupon the authors of the former opinion

were presently seconded by other wittier and better learned; who being loath that the forme of Church-politie which they sought to bring in should be otherwise then in the highest degree accounted of, tooke first an exception against the difference betweene Church-politie and matters of necessitie to saluation; secondly against the restraint of scripture, which they say receiueth iniurie at our hands, when we teach that it teacheth not as well matters of politie as of faith and saluation.  3. Constrained hereby we haue bene therefore, both to maintaine that distinction, as a thing not only true in it selfe, but by them likewise so acknowledged, though vnawares;  4. and to make manifest that from scripture wee offer not to derogate the least thing that truth thereunto doth claime, in as much as by vs it is willingly confest, that the scripture of God is a storehouse abounding with inestimable treasures of wisedome and knowledge in many kindes, ouer and aboue thinges in this one kinde barely necessary; yea euen that matters of Ecclesiasticall politie are not therein omitted, but taught also, albeit not so taught as those other thinges before mentioned. For so perfectly are those thinges taught, that nothing can euer need to be added, nothing euer cease to be necessary: these on the contrarie side, as being of a farre other nature and qualitie, not so strictly nor euerlastingly commaunded in scripture, but that vnto the complete forme of Church-politie much may bee requisite which the scripture teacheth not, and much which it hath taught, become vnrequisite, sometime because we neede not vse it, sometime also because wee cannot. In which respect for mine owne part, although I see that certaine reformed Churches, the Scottish especially and French, haue not that which best agreeth with the sacred scripture, I meane the gouernment that is by Bishops, in as much as both those churches are fallen vnder a different kinde of regiment, which to remedie it is for the one altogether too late, and too soone for the other during their present affliction and trouble; this their defect and imperfection I had rather lament in such case then exagitate, considering that men oftentimes without any fault of their owne, may be driuen to want that kinde of politie or regiment which is best, and to content themselues with that, which either the irremediable error of former times, or the necessitie of the present hath cast vpon them.  5. Now because that position first mentioned, which holdeth it necessarie that all thinges which the Church may lawfully doe in her owne regiment be commaunded in holy scripture, hath by the latter defendors thereof beene greatly qualified; who, though perceiuing it to be ouer extreame, are notwithstanding loth to acknowledge any ouersight therein, and therefore labour what they may to salue it by construction; we haue for the more perspicuitie deliuered what was thereby meant at the first;  6. how iniurious a thing it were vnto all the Churches of God for men to hold it in that meaning;  7. and how vnperfect their interpretations are who so much labour to helpe it, eyther by diuiding commaundements of scripture into two kindes, and so defending that all thinges must be commaunded, if not in speciall, yet in generall precepts;  8. or by taking it as meant that in case the Church doe deuise any new order, shee ought therein to follow the direction of scripture onely, and not any starlight of mans reason.  9. Bothe which euasions being cut off, wee haue in the next place declared after what sort the Church may lawfully frame to her selfe lawes of politie, and in what reckoning such positiue lawes both are with God, and

should be with men.  10. Furthermore because to abridge the libertie of the Church in this behalfe, it hath bene made a thing very odious, that when God himselfe hath deuised some certaine lawes and committed them to sacred scripture, man by abrogation, addition, or any way, should presume to alter and change them; it was of necessitie to be examined, whether the authoritie of God in making, or his care in committing those his lawes vnto scripture, be sufficient arguments to proue that God doth in no case allow they should suffer any such kind of change.  11. The last refuge for proofe that diuine lawes of Christian Church-politie may not be altered, by extinguishment of any olde or addition of new in that kinde, is partly a marueilous strange discourse, that Christ (vnlesse he would show himselfe not so faithfull as Moses, or not Nisi reip. suae statum omnē constituerit, magistratus ordinarit, singulorum munera potestatém

                  um finiendae lites: non solum minus Ecclesiae Christianae prouidit quàm Moses olim Iudaicae, sed quā à Lycurgo, Solone, Numa ciuitatib. suis prospectū fit. Lib. de Ecclesiast. Disc. so wise as Lycurgus and Solon) must needes haue set downe in holy scripture some certaine complete and vnchangeable forme of politie; and partly a coloured shewe of some euidence, where change of that sort of lawes may seeme expressely forbidden, although in truth nothing lesse be done. I might haue added hereunto their more familiar and popular disputes; as, The Church is a Citie, yea the Citie of the great king, and the life of a Citie is politie: The Church is the house of the liuing God, and what house can there be, without some order for the gouernment of it? In the royall house of a Prince there must be officers for gouernment, such as not any seruant in the house, but the Prince whose the house is shall iudge cōuenient: So the house of God must haue orders for the gouernment of it, such as not any of the household, but God himselfe hath appointed. It cannot stand with the loue and wisedome of God, to leaue such order vntaken as is necessary for the due gouernment of his Church. The numbers, degrees, orders, and attire of Salomons seruants did shewe his wisedome: therefore he which is greater then Salomon, hath not failed to leaue in his house such orders for gouernment thereof, as may serue to be as a looking glasse for his prouidence, care, and wisedome to be seene in. That little sparke of the light of nature which remaineth in vs, may serue vs for the affaires of this life. But as in all
other matters concerning the kingdome of heauen, so principally in this which concerneth the very gouernment of that kingdome, needfull it is wee should be taught of God. As long as men are perswaded of any order that it is only of men, they presume of their owne vnderstanding, and they thinke to deuise an other not only as good, but better then that which they haue receiued. By seueritie of punishment, this presumption and curiositie may be restrained. But that cannot worke such chearefull obedience as is yeelded, where the conscience hath respect to God as the author of lawes and orders. This was it which countenanced the laws of Moses, made concerning outward politie for the administration of holy things. The like some law giuers of the Heathens did pretend, but falsely; yet wisely discerning the vse of this perswasion. For the better obedience sake therfore it was expediēt, that God should be author of the politie of his church.
But to what issue doth all this come? A man would thinke that they which hold out with such discourses, were of nothing more fully perswaded thē of this, that the scripture hath set downe a complete forme of Church-politie, vniuersall, perpetuall, altogether vnchangeable. For so it would follow if the premises were sound and strong to such effect as is pretended. Notwithstanding they which haue thus formally maintained argument in defence of the first ouersight, are

by the very euidence of truth themselues constrained to make this in effect their conclusion, that the Scripture of God hath many thinges concerning Church-politie; that of those many some are of greater waight, some of lesse; that what hath beene vrged as touching immutabilitie of lawes, it extendeth in truth no further then onely to lawes wherein thinges of greater moment are prescribed. Now those things of greater moment, what are they? Forsooth, Doctors,

               Pastors, Layelders, Elderships compounded of these three; Synods consisting of many Elderships; Deacons, women-church-seruants or widowes; free consent of the people vnto actiōs of greatest moment, after they be by Churches or Synodes orderly resolued. All this forme of politie (if yet wee may terme that a forme of building, when men haue laide a fewe rafters together, and those not all of the soundest neither) but howsoeuer, all this forme they conclude is prescribed in such sort, that to adde to it any thing as of like importance, (for so I thinke they meane) or to abrogate of it any thing at all, is vnlawfull. In which resolution if they will firmely and constantly persist, I see not but that concerning the points which hitherto haue beene disputed of, they must agree that they haue molested the Church with needelesse opposition; and henceforward as we said before betake themselues wholly vnto the triall of particulars, whether euery of those thinges which they esteeme as principall, be eyther so esteemed of, or at all established for perpetuitie in holy scripture; and whether any particular thing in our Church-politie bee receiued other then the scripture alloweth of, eyther in greater thinges or in smaller. The matters wherein Church-politie is conuersant, are the publique religious duties of the Church, as the administration of the word and sacraments, prayers, spirituall censures and the like. To these the Church standeth alwayes bound. Lawes of politie are laws which appoint in what maner these duties shal be performed. In performance whereof because all that are of the Church cannot ioyntly and equally worke, the first thing in politie required, is a difference of persons in the Church, without which difference those functions cannot in orderly sort bee executed. Hereupon we hold, that Gods clergie are a state which hath bene and will be, as long as there is a Church vpō earth, necessarie by the plaine word of God himselfe; a state whereunto the rest of Gods people must be subiect as touching things that appertaine to their soules health. For where politie is, it cannot but appoint some to be leaders of others, and some to be led by others.Luc. 6.

               If the blind leade the blind, they both perish. It is with the clergie, if their persons be respected, euen as it is with other men; their qualitie many times farre beneath that, which the dignitie of their place requireth. Howbeit according to the order of politie, they being the lightes of the world,

                others (though better and wiser) must that way be subiect vnto them. Againe, for as much as where the clergie are any great multitude, order doth necessarily require that by degrees they be distinguished; wee holde there haue euer bene and euer ought to be in such case, at least wise two sorts of Ecclesiasticall persons, the one subordinate vnto the other▪ as to the Apostles in the beginning, and to the Bishops alwaies since, wee finde plainely both in scripture and in all Ecclesiasticall records, other ministers of the word and sacraments haue bene. Moreouer it cannot enter into any mans conceipt to thinke it lawfull, that euery man which listeth should take vpon him charge in the Church; and therefore a solemne admittance is of such necessitie, that without it there can be no church-politie. A number of particularities there

are, which make for the more conuenient being of these principall & perpetuall parts in Ecclesiasticall politie, but yet are not of such constant vse and necessitie in Gods Church. Of this kind are times and places appointed for the exercise of religion; specialties belonging to the publike solemnitie of the word, the sacraments and praier; the enlargement or abridgement of functions ministeriall depending vpon those two principall before mentioned; to conclude, euen whatsoeuer doth by way of formalitie & circumstance concerne any publique action of the Church. Now although that which the scripture hath of thinges in the former kind be for euer permanent; yet in the later both much of that which the scripture teacheth is not alwaies needfull; and much the Church of God shall alwaies neede which the scripture teacheth not. So as the forme of politie by thē set downe for perpetuitie, is three waies faultie. Faultie in omitting some things which in scripture are of that nature, as namely the difference that ought to bee of Pastors when they grow to any great multitude; faultie in requiring Doctors, Deacons, Widowes, and such like; as thinges of perpetuall necessitie by the law of God, which in truth are nothing lesse; faultie also in vrging some thinges by scripture immutable, as their Layelders, which the scripture neither maketh immutable, nor at all teacheth, for any thing either we can as yet find, or they haue hitherto beene able to proue. But hereof more in the bookes that followe. As for those maruellous discourses, wherby they aduenture to argue that God must needs haue done the thing which they imagine was to be done; I must confesse I haue often wondred at their exceeding boldnesse herein. When the question is whether God haue deliuered in scripture (as they affirme he hath) a complet particular immutable forme of Church-politie; why take they that other both presumptuous and superfluous labour, to proue he should haue done it; there being no way in this case to proue the deede of God, sauing only by producing that euidence wherein he hath done it? But if there be no such thing apparent vpon record, they do as if one should demaund a legacie by force and vertue of some written testament, wherein there being no such thing specified, hee pleadeth that there it must needes be, and bringeth argumēts from the loue or goodwill which alwaies the testatour bore him, imagining that these or the like proofes will conuict a testament to haue that in it, which other mē can no where by reading find. In matters which concerne the actions of God, the most dutiful way on our part is to search what God hath done, and with meeknes to admire that, rather thē to dispute what he in congruitie of reason ought to do. The waies which he hath whereby to do all things for the greatest good of his Church, are mo in number thē we can search, other in nature thē that we should presume to determine which of many should be the fittest for him to choose, till such time as we see he hath chosen of many some one; which one wee then may boldly conclude to be the fittest, because he hath taken it before the rest. When we doe otherwise, surely we exceede our bounds, who and where we are we forget; and therefore needfull it is that our pride in such cases be controld, and our disputes beaten backe with those demands of the blessed Apostle. How vnsearchable are his iudgements,

                  2 The first thing they blame in the kinde of our ceremonies is, that wee haue not in them auncient Apostolicall simplicitie, but a greater pompe & statelinesse.
                  
                  3 The second, that so many of them are the same which the Church of Rome vseth; and the reasons which they bring to proue them for that cause blame worthy.

            1 SVch was the ancient simplicitie and softnes of spirit which sometimes preuailed in the world,How great vse ceremonies haue in the Church. that they whose wordes were euen as oracles amongst men, seemed euermore loth to giue sentence against any thing publiquely receiued in the Church of God, except it were wonderfull apparently euill; for that they did not so much incline to that seueritie, which delighteth to reproue the least things it seeth amisse▪ as to

that charity, which is vnwilling to behold any thing that dutie bindeth it to reproue. The state of this present age, wherein zeale hath drowned charitie, & skill meeknes, wil not now suffer any mā to maruel whatsoeuer he shal hear reproued by whōsoeuer. Those rites & ceremonies of the church therefore, which are the selfesame now that they were whē holy & vertuous men maintained thē against prophane and deriding aduersaries, her owne children haue at this day in derision. Whether iustly or no, it shall then appeare, when all thinges are heard which they haue to alleage against the outward receiued orders of this church. Which in as much as thēselues do compare vnto mint and comin,
               Mat. 23.23. The doctrine and discipline of the Church, as the waightiest things, ought especially to be looked vnto: but the ceremonies also, as mint & comin, ought not to be neglected. T.C. l. 3. p. 171. graunting thē to be no part of those things which in the matter of politie are waightier, we hope that for small things their strife will neither bee earnest nor long. The sifting of that which is obiected against the orders of the church in particular, doth not belong vnto this place. Here we are to discusse onely those generall exceptions, which haue bene taken at any time against them. First therfore to the end that their nature and vse whereunto they serue may plainely appeare, and so afterwardes their qualitie the better be discerned; we are to note that in euery grand or main publique dutie which God requireth at the hāds of his Church, there is, besides that matter and forme wherein the essence therof consisteth, a certaine outward fashion whereby the same is in decent sort administred. The substance of all Religious actions is deliuered from God himself in few words. For example sake in the sacraments, Vnto the element let the word be added, and they both doe make a sacrament, saith S. Augustine. Baptisme is giuen by the element of water, and that prescript forme of words which the church of Christ doth vse; the sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ is administred in the elements of bread and wine, if those mysticall words be added thereunto. But the due and decent forme of administring those holy sacramēts, doth require a great deale more. The end which is aimed at in setting downe the outward forme of all religious actiōs, is the edification of the Church. Now men are edified, when either their vnderstanding is taught somewhat whereof in such actions it behoueth all men to consider; or whē their harts are moued with any affectiō suteable therunto, whē their minds are in any sort stirred vp vnto that reuerence, deuotion, attention & due regard, which in those cases seemeth requisit. Because therfore vnto this purpose not only speech, but sundry sēsible means besides haue alwaies bin thought necessary, & especially those means which being obiect to the eye, the liueliest & the most apprehensiue sense of all other, haue in that respect seemed the fittest to make a deepe and strong impression; from hence haue risen not onely a number of praiers, readings, questionings, exhortings, but euen of visible signes also; which being vsed in performance of holy actions, are vndoubtedly most effectual to open such matter, as men when they know & remēber carefully, must needs be a great deale the better informed to what effect such duties serue. We must not thinke but that there is some ground of reason euen in nature, whereby it commeth to passe, that no nation vnder heauen either doth or euer did suffer publique actiōs which are of waight, whether they be ciuil and temporall, or else spirituall and sacred, to passe without some visible solemnitie; the very strangenes whereof and difference from that which is common, doth cause popular eyes to obserue and to marke the same. Wordes both because they are common, and doe not so strongly moue the phancie of man, are for the most parte but sleightly

heard: and therfore with singular wisdome it hath bene prouided▪ that the deeds of men which are made in the presence of witnesses, should passe not onely with words, but also with certaine sensible actions, the memory wherof is farre more easie and durable then the memorie of speech can be. The things which so long experience of all ages hath confirmed and made profitable, let not vs presume to condemne as follies and toyes, because wee sometimes know not the cause and reason of them. A wit disposed to scorne whatsoeuer it doth not conceiue, might aske wherefore Abraham should say to his seruant, Put thy hand vnder my thigh and sweare: was it not sufficient for his seruant to shew the Religion of an othe,Gen. 24.2. by naming the Lord God of heauen and earth, vnlesse that straunge ceremonie were added? In contracts, bargaines and conueiances, a mans worde is a token sufficient to expresse his wil.Ruth. 4.7. 
               Yet this was the auncient maner in Israell concerning redeeming and exchanging to establish all things; A man did pluck off his shooe, and gaue it his neighbour; and this was a sure witnesse in Israel. Amongst the Romans in their making of a bondman free, was it not wondred wherefore so great a doe should bee made? The maister to present his slaue in some court, to take him by the hand, and not onely to say in the hearing of the publique magistrate, I will that this man become free, but after these solemne wordes vttered, to strike him on the cheeke, to turne him round, the haire of his head to be shaued off, the magistrate to touch him thrise with a rod, in the end a cap and a white garment to be giuen him. To what purpose all this circumstance? Amongst the Hebrewes how strange & in outward appearance almost against reason,Exod. 21.
                     •
                  . that he which was minded to make himselfe a perpetuall seruant, should not only testifie so much in the presence of the iudge, but for a visible token thereof haue also his eare bored through with a nawle? It were an infinite labour to prosecute these things so far as they might be exempplified both in ciuill and religious actions. For in bothe they haue their necessary vse and force. Dionis. p. 12

               The sensible things which Religion hath allowed, are resemblances framed according to things spiritually vnderstood, wherunto they serue as a hand to lead and a way to direct. And whereas it may peraduenture be obiected, that to adde to religious duties such rites and ceremonies as are significant; is to institute new sacraments: sure I am they will not say that Numa Pompilius did ordaine a sacrament, a significant ceremonie he did ordaine, in commanding the Priests Litt.

               to execute the work of their diuine seruice with their handes as farre as to the fingers couered; thereby signifiing that fidelitie must be defended, and that mens right handes are the sacred seate thereof. Againe we are also to put them in mind, that themselues do not holde all significant ceremonies for sacramentes; in as much as imposition of handes they denie to be a sacrament; and yet they giue thereunto a forcible signification. For concerning it their words are these, Eccl. disci. 101.51. 
               The party ordained by this ceremony, was put in mind of his seperation to the worke of the Lord, that remembring himselfe to be taken as it were with the hand of God from amongst others, this might teach him not to account himselfe now his owne, nor to doe what himselfe listeth; but to consider that God hath set him about a worke, which if he will discharge & accomplish, he may at the hands of God assure himselfe of reward; and if otherwise, of reuenge. Touching significant ceremonies, some of thē are sacramēts, some as sacramēts only. Sacraments are those, which are signes & tokēs of some general promised grace, which alwaies really descendeth from God vnto the soule that duly receiueth thē: other significant tokēs are

onely as sacraments, yet no sacraments. Which is not our distinction but theirs▪ For concerning the Apostles imposition of handes,

                  ol. 25. these are their owne words; Manuum signum hoc & quasi sacramentum vsurparunt; They vsed this signe, or as it were sacrament.
            2 Concerning rites and ceremonies, there may be fault, either in the kinde, or in the number and multitude of them.The first thing they blame in the kind of our ceremonies is, that we haue not in them ancient Apostolical simplicitie, but a greater pompe and statelines. lib. eccle. disci. & T.C. l. 3. p. 181. The first thing blamed about the kind of ours is, that in many thinges we haue departed from the auncient simplicitie of Christ and his Apostles, we haue embraced more outward statelinesse, we haue those orders in the exercise of Religion, which they who best pleased God and serued him most deuoutly neuer had. For it is out of doubt, that the first state of thinges was best, that in the prime of Christian Religion faith was soundest, the scriptures of God were then best vnderstood by all men, all parts of godlines did then most abound▪ and therefore it must needes follow, that customes lawes and ordinances deuised since, are not so good for the Church of Christ; but the best way is to cut off later inuentions, and to reduce thinges vnto the auntient state wherin at the first they were. Which rule or canō we hold to be either vncertain, or at leastwise vnsufficient; if not bothe. For in case it be certain, hard it cannot be for them to shew vs, where we shall finde it so exactly set downe, that wee may say without all controuersie, These were the orders of the Apostles times, these wholly and onely, neither fewer nor moe then these. True it is that many things of this nature be alluded vnto, yea many thinges declared, and many thinges necessarily collected out of the Apostles writings. But is it necessary that all the orders of the Church which were then in vse should be contained in their bookes? Surely no. For if the tenor of their writinges be well obserued, it shall vnto any man easily appeare, that no more of them are there touched, then were needfull to be spoken of somtimes by one occasion and sometimes by another. Will they allow then of any other records besides?Tom. 7. de bap contra Dona
                  
                     •
                  ist. l. 5. cap 23. Well assured I am they are farre enough from acknowledging that the church ought to keepe any thing as Apostolicall, which is not found in the Apostles writings▪ in what other recordes soeuer it be found. And therefore whereas S. Augustine affirmeth, T.C. l. 1. p. 31. If this iudgement of S. Augustine bee a good iudgement and sound; then there be some things commaunded of God, which are not in the scripture; and therefore there is no sufficient doctrine contained in scripture whereby we may be saued. For all the commaundements of God and of the Apostles are needfull for our saluation.
                that those thinges which the whole Church of Christ doth hold, may well be thought to bee Apostolicall, although they be not found written; this his iudgement they vtterly condemne. I will not here stand in defence of S. Augustines opinion, which is that such thinges are indeede Apostolicall; but yet with this exception, vnlesse the decree of some generall councell haue happily caused them to be receiued: for of positiue lawes and orders receiued throughout the whole Christian world, S. Augustine could imagine no other fountaine saue these two. But to let passe S. Augustine, they who condemne him herein, must needs confesse it a very vncertaine thing what the orders of the Church were in the Apostles times, seeing the scriptures doe not mention them all,Vid. Epist. 118 and other records thereof besides they vtterly reiect. So that in tying the Church to the orders of the Apostles times, they tie it to a maruellous vncertain rule; vnlesse they require the obseruatiō of no orders but only those which are knowne to be Apostolicall by the Apostles owne writings. But then is not this their rule of such sufficiencie, that we should vse it as a touchstone

to trie the orders of the Church by for euer. Our ende ought alwaies to bee the same; our waies and meanes thereunto not so. The glory of God and the good of his Church was the thing which the Apostles aymed at, and therefore ought to bee the marke whereat we also leuell. But seeing those rites and orders may be at one time more, which at an other are lesse auaileable vnto that purpose: what reason is there in these thinges to vrge the state of one onely age, as a patterne for all to followe? It is not I am right sure their meaning, that we should now assemble our people to serue God in close & secret meetings; or that common brookes or riuers should be vsed for places of baptisme; or that the Eucharist should be ministred after meate; or that the custome of Church feasting should bee renued; or that all kinde of standing prouision for the ministrie should be vtterly taken away, and their estate made againe dependent vpon the voluntary deuotion of men. In these thinges they easily perceiue how vnfit that were for the present, which was for the first age conuenient enough. The faith zeale & godlines of former times is worthily had in honour: but doth this proue that the orders of the Church of Christ must bee still the selfesame with theirs▪ that nothing may be which was not then, or that nothing which then was may lawfully since haue ceased? They who recall the Church vnto that which was at the first, must necessarily set boundes and limits vnto their speeches. If any thing haue bene receiued repugnant vnto that which was first deliuered, the first things in this case must stand, the last giue place vnto them. But where difference is without repugnancie, that which hath bene can be no preiudice to that which is. Let the state of the people of God when they were in the house of bondage, and their maner of seruing God in a strange land, be compared with that which Canaan and Ierusalem did afford, and who seeth not what huge difference there was betweene them? In Aegypt it may be they were right glad to take some corner of a poore cottage, & there to serue God vpon their knees, peraduenture couered in dust and strawe sometimes. Neither were they therefore the lesse accepted of God; but he was with them in all their afflictions, and at the length by working their admirable deliuerance, did testifie that they serued him not in vaine. Notwithstanding in the very desert they are no sooner possest of some little thing of their owne, but a tabernacle is required at their handes. Beeing planted in the land of Canaan, and hauing Dauid to be their King, when the Lord had giuen him rest from all his enemies, it greeued his religious minde to consider the growth of his owne estate and dignitie, the affaires of religion continuing still in the former manner: Beholde now I dwell in an house of Cedar trees,

               3 Yea but wee haue framed our selues to the customes of the Church of Rome;Our orders & ceremonies blamed, in that so many of thē are the same which the Church of Rome vseth. Eccles. discipl. fol. 12. T.C. lib. 1. p. 131. our orders and ceremonies are Papisticall. It is espied that our Church-founders were not so carefull as in this matter they should haue bene, but contented themselues with such discipline as they took from the Church of Rome. Their error we ought to reforme by abolishing all Popish orders. There must bee no communion nor fellowship with Papistes, neither in doctrine, ceremonies, nor gouernment. It is not enough that wee are deuided from the Church of Rome by the single wall of doctrine, reteining as we do part of their ceremonies, and almost their whole gouernment: but gouernment or ceremonies or whatsoeuer it be which is popish, away with it. This is the thing they require in vs,T.C. lib. 1. p. 20. the vtter relinquishment of all thinges popish. Wherein to the ende wee may answer them according vnto their plaine direct meaning, and not take aduantage of doubtfull speech, whereby controuersies growe alwaies endlesse; their maine position being this, that nothing should bee placed in the Church but what God in his word hath commaunded,
               T.C. lib. 1. p. 25 they must of necessitie holde all for popish, which the Church of Rome hath ouer and besides this. By popish orders ceremonies and gouernment they must therefore meane in euery of these so much, as the church of Rome hath embraced without commandement of Gods word: so that whatsoeuer such thing we haue, if the Church of Rome haue it also; it goeth vnder the name of those thinges that are Popish, yea although it be lawfull, although agreeable to the word of God. For so they plainely affirme saying:T.C. l. 1. p. 13
                     •
                  . 
               Although the formes and ceremonies which they (the Church of Rome) vsed were not vnlawfull, and that they contained nothing which is not agreeable to the word of God; yet notwithstanding neither the word of God, nor reason, nor the examples of the eldest Churches both Iewish and Christian; do permit vs to vse the same formes and ceremonies, being neither commanded of God, neither such as there may not as good as they and rather better be established. The question therefore is, whether we may follow the Church of Rome in those orders, rites and ceremonies, wherein wee doe not thinke them blameable; or else ought to deuise others, and to haue no conformitie with them, no not as much as in these thinges. In this sense and construction therefore as they affirme, so we denie, that whatsoeuer is popish wee ought to abrogate. Their arguments to proue that generally all popish orders and ceremonies ought to be cleane abolished, are in summe these? First whereas wee allow the iudgement of Saint Augustine,
               T.C. l. 1. p. 30. 
               that touching those thinges of this kinde which are not commaunded or forbidden in the scripture, wee are to obserue the custome of the people of God, and decree of our forefathers: how can we retaine the customes and constitutions of the Papistes in such things, who were neither the people of God nor our forefathers? Secondly although the formes and ceremonies of the Church of Rome were not vnlawfull, neither did containe any thing which is not agreeable to the word of God;
               T.C. l. 1. p. 131. 
               yet neither the worde of God, nor the example of the Eldest Churches of God, nor reason doe permit vs to vse the same; they being heretiques, and so neare about vs, and their orders beeing neither commaunded of God, nor yet such but that as good or rather better may be established. It is against the word of God, to haue conformitie with the Church of Rome in such things; as appeareth in that the wisdome of God hath thought it a good way to keepe his people from infection of Idolatry and superstition, by seuering them from idolaters in outward ceremonies; and therefore hath forbidden them to doe thinges which are in themselues very

lawfull to be done: And further whereas the Lorde was carefull to seuer them by ceremonies from other nations; yet was he not so careful to seuer them from any, as from the Aegyptians amongst whom they liued, and from those nations which were next neighbours vnto them, because from thē was the greatest feare of infection. So that following the course which the wisdom of God doth teach,T.C. l. 1. p. 132 Tom. 2. Br
                     ••
                  . 73. 
               it were more safe for vs to cōforme our indifferent ceremonies to the Turkes which are farre off, then to the Papists which are so neare. Touching the example of the eldest Churches of God, in one councell it was decreed, that Christians should not decke their houses with baye leaues and greene boughes, because the Pagans did vse so to doe; and that they should not rest from their labours those daies that the Pagans did, that they should not keepe the first day of euery month as they did.
               Con. Africa. cap. 27. 
               Another councell decreed, that Christians should not celebrate feastes on the birth daies of the Martyrs, because it was the manner of the heathē. O saith Tertullian, better is the religion of the Heathen: for they vse no solemnitie of the Christians, neither the Lordes daye, neither the Pentecost, and if they knew them▪ they would haue nothing to doe with them;Lib. de Idololatria. 
               for they would be afraide least they should seeme Christians: but we are not afraid to be called heathen. The same Tertullian would not haue Christians to sit after they had prayed,He seemeth to mean the feast of Easter day, celebrated in the memory of our Sauiours resurrection, and for that cause termed the Lords day. Lib. de Anima because the Idolaters did so. Whereby it appeareth, that both of particular men and of councels, in making or abolishing of ceremonies heed hath bene taken that the Christians should not be like the Idolaters, no not in those thinges which of themselues are most indifferent to b
                     •
                   vsed or not vsed. The same cōformitie is not lesse opposite vnto reason; first in as much as Contraries must be cured by their contraries; and therefore Poperie being Antichristianitie is not healed, but by establishment of orders thereunto opposite. The way to bring a drunken mā to sobrietie, is to carry him as far frō excesse of drink as may be. To rectifie a crooked sticke, we bend it on the contrary side, as farre as it was at the first on that side from whence we drawe it; and so it commeth in the ende to a middle betweene both, which is perfect straightnes. Vtter Inconformitie therefore with the Church of Rome in these thinges, is the best and surest policie which the Church can vse. While we vse their ceremonies, they take occasion to blaspheme, saying that our religion cannot stand by it selfe, vnlesse it leane vpon the staffe of their ceremonies. They hereby conceiue great hope of hauing the rest of their popery in the end, which hope causeth them to be more frozen in their wickednesse.
               T.C. l. 3. p. 178. 
               Neither is it without cause that they haue this hope, cōsidering that which maister Bucer noteth vpō the 18. of Saint Mathew, that where these thinges haue bene left, Popery hath returned; but on the other part in places which haue bene cleansed of these thinges, it hath not yet bene seene that it hath had any entrance. None make such clamors for these ceremonies,T.C. l. 3. p. 17

                   as the Papists and those whom they suborne; a manifest token how much they triumph and ioy in these thinges. They breede griefe of minde in a number that are godly minded, and haue Antichristianitie in such detestation, that their mindes are martyred with the very sight of them in the Church. Such godly brethren we ought not thus to grieue with vnprofitable ceremonies, yea ceremonies wherein there is not onely no profit,
               T.C. l. 3. p. 180. 
               but also daunger of great hurt that may growe to the Church by infection, which popish ceremonies are meanes to breede. This in effect is the summe and substance of that which they bring by way of oppositiō against those orders which we haue commō with the church of Rome; these are the reasons wherewith they would proue our ceremonies in that respect worthy of blame.
            
               
               That wheras they who blame vs in this behalfe, whē reason euicteth that all such ceremonies are not to be abolished, make answere that when they condemne popish ceremonies their meaning is of ceremonies vnprofitable, or ceremonies in stead wherof as good or better may be deuised: they cannot hereby get out of the briers, but contradict and gainesay themselues; in as much as their vsuall maner is to proue, that ceremonies vncommaunded of God, and yet vsed in the Church of Rome, are for this very cause vnprofitable to vs, and not so good as others in their place would be.4 Before we answere vnto these thinges, we are to cut off that, wherunto they from whom these obiections proceed, do oftentimes flie for defence and succor, when the force and strength of their argumēts is elided. For the ceremonies in vse amōgst vs, being in no other respect retained, sauing onely for that to retaine thē is to our seeming good and profitable, yea so profitable and so good, that if we had either simply taken them cleane away, or els remoued them so as to place in their stead others, we had done worse: the plaine & direct way against vs herein had bin only to proue, that all such ceremonies as they require to be abolished are retained by vs with the hurt of the Church, or with lesse benefit thē the abolishmēt of thē would bring. But for as much as they saw how hardly they should be able to perform this; they took a more compendious way, traducing the ceremonies of our church vnder the name of being popish. The cause why this way seemed better vnto them was, for that the name of Popery is more odious then very Paganisme amongst diuers of the more simple sorte; so as whatsoeuer they heare named popish, they presently conceiue deepe hatred against it, imagining there cā be nothing cōtained in that name, but needs it must be exceeding detestable. The eares of the people they haue therfore filled with strong clamor; The church of Englād is fraught with popish ceremonies: They that fauour the cause of reformatiō, maintaine nothing but the sinceritie of the Gospel of Iesus Christ: All such as withstand them, fight for the lawes of his sworne enemie, vphold the filthy reliques of Antichrist; and are defenders of that which is popish. These are the notes wherewith are drawn from the harts of the multitude so many sighs; with these tunes their mindes are exasperated against the lawfull guides and gouernours of their souls; these are the voices that fil thē with general discōtentment, as though the bosome of that famous Church wherin they liue, were more noysome then any dungeon. But when the authors of so scandalous incantations are examined and called to account how they can iustifie such their dealings; when they are vrged directly to answere, whether it be lawfull for vs to vse any such ceremonies as the Church of Rome vseth,T.C. lib. p. 171. What an open vntruth is it, that this is one of our principles not to be lawful to vse the same ceremonies which the Papists did: when as I haue both before declared the contrary, and euen here haue expressely added▪ that they are not to be vsed when as good or better way be established?
                although the same be not cōmanded in the word of God; being driuen to see that the vse of some such ceremonies must of necessitie be granted lawfull, they go about to make vs beleeue that they are iust of the same opinion, and that they only think such ceremonies are not to be vsed when they are vnprofitable, or when as good or better may be established. Which answer is both idle in regard of vs, and also repugnant to themselues. It is in regard of vs very vaine to make this answere, because they know that what ceremonies we retaine common vnto the Church of Rome, wee therefore retaine them, for that we iudge them to be profitable, and to be such that others in stead of them would be worse. So that when they say that we ought to abrogate such Romish ceremonies as are vnprofitable, or els might haue other more profitable in their stead; they trifle and they beat the aire about nothing which toucheth vs, vnlesse they meane that wee ought to abrogate all Romish ceremonies, which in their iudgement haue either no vse, or lesse vse then some other might haue. But then must they shewe some commission, wherby they are authorized to sit as iudges,

and we required to take their iudgement for good in this case. Otherwise their sentences will not be greatly regarded, when they oppose their Me thinketh vnto the orders of the Church of England: as in the question about surplesses one of them doth; If we looke to the colour, blacke me thinketh is more decent; if to the forme, a garment downe to the foote hath a great deale more cōlinesse in it.
               Ecclesi. discipl. fol. 100. If they thinke that we ought to proue the ceremonies cōmodious which we haue reteined, they do in this point very greatly deceiue themselues. For in all right & equity; that which the Church hath receiued & held so long for good, that which publique approbation hath ratified, must cary the benefit of presumption with it to be accompted meet and conuenient.T.C. l. 3. p. 176.

                They which haue stood vp as yesterday to challenge it of defect, must proue their challenge. If we being defendants do answer, that the ceremonies in question are godly, comely, decent, profitable for the Church▪ their reply is childish & vnorderly to say, that we demaund the thing in question, & shew the pouerty of our cause, the goodnes wherof we are faine to begge that our aduersaries would graunt. For on our part this must be the aunswere, which orderly proceeding doth require. The burthen of prouing doth rest on them. In them it is friuolous to say, we ought not to vse bad ceremonies of the Church of Rome, and presume all such bad as it pleaseth themselues to dislike; vnlesse we can perswade them the contrary. Besides, they are herin opposite also to themselues. For what one thing is so common with thē, as to vse the custome of the Church of Rome for an argument to proue, that such & such ceremonies cānot be good & profitable for vs, in as much as that church vseth them? Which vsual kind of disputing, sheweth that they do not disallow onely those Romish ceremonies which are vnprofitable,T.C. l. p. 174. but count all vnprofitable which are Romish; that is to say, which haue bene deuised by the Church of Rome, or which are vsed in that Church, and not prescribed in the word of God. For this is the onely limitation which they can vse sutable vnto their other positions. And therefore the cause which they yeeld, why they hold it lawfull to reteine in Doctrine and in Discipline some things as good, which yet are common to the Church of Rome, is for that those good things are perpetual commandements, in whose place no other can come; but ceremonies are changeable. So that their iudgement in truth is, that whatsoeuer by the word of God is not changeable in the Church of Rome, that Churches vsing is a cause, why reformed Churches ought to change it, and not to thinke it good or profitable. And least we seeme to father any thing vpon them more thē is properly their owne, let them reade euen their owne words, where they complaine that we are thus constrained to be like vnto the Papists in Any their ceremonies; yea they vrge that this cause although it were alone,T.C. l. 3. p. 177.

                ought to moue them to whom that belongeth to do thē away, for as much as they are their ceremonies, and that the B. of Salisbury doth iustifie this their complaint. The clause is vntrue which they adde concerning the B. of Salisbury; but the sentence doth shew, that we do them no wrōg in setting downe the state of the question betweene vs thus; Whether we ought to abolish out of the Church of England all such orders, rites and ceremonies, as are established in the Church of Rome, and are not prescribed in the word of God.

For the affirmatiue whereof we are now to answer such proofes of theirs as haue bene before alleaged.
            5 Let the Church of Rome be what it will,That our allowing the customes of our fathers to be followed, is no proofe that we may not allow some customes which the Church of Rome hath, although we do not accōpt of them as of our fathers. let them that are of it be the people of God and our fathers in the Christian faith, or let them be otherwise, hold them for Catholiques, or hold them for heretiques, it is not a thing either one way or other in this present question greatly material. Our conformity with thē in such things as haue bene proposed, is not proued as yet vnlawfull by all this S. Augustine hath said, yea and we haue allowed his saying; That the custome of the people of God, and the decrees of our forefathers are to be kept, touching those things wherof the scripture hath neither one way nor other giuen vs any charge. What then? Doth it here therfore follow, that they being neither the people of God nor our forefathers, are for that cause in nothing to be followed? This consequent were good, if so be it were graunted, that onely the custome of the people of God & the decrees of our forefathers are in such case to be obserued. But then should no other kind of later laws in the church be good, which were a grosse absurdity to think. S. Augustines speech therefore doth import, that where we haue no diuine precept, if yet we haue the custome of the people of God, or a decree of our forefathers; this is a law and must be kept. Notwithstanding it is not denied, but that we lawfully may obserue the positiue constitutions of our owne Churches, although the same were but yesterday made by our selues alone. Nor is there any thing in this to proue, that the Church of England might not by law receiue orders, rites or customes from the Church of Rome, although they were neither the people of God nor yet our forefathers. How much lesse when we haue receiued from them nothing, but that which they did themselues receiue from such, as we cannot deny to haue bene the people of God, yea such as either we must acknowledge for our owne forefathers, or else disdaine the race of Christ?
            6 The rites and orders wherein we follow the Church of Rome,That the course which the wisedome of God doth teach, maketh not against our conformitie with the Church of Rome in such things. are of no other kind thē such as the Church of Geneua it selfe doth follow thē in. We follow the church of Rome in moe things; yet they in some things of the same nature about which our present controuersie is: so that the difference is not in the kind, but in the number of rites only, wherein they and we do follow the Church of Rome. The vse of wafer-cakes, the custom of godfathers & godmothers in baptisme, are things not commanded nor forbidden in scripture; things which haue bene of old, & are reteined in the Church of Rome euen at this very hower. Is conformity with Rome in such things a blemish vnto the Church of England, & vnto Churches abroad an ornament? Let thē, if not for the reuerence they ow vnto this Church, in the bowels wherof they haue receiued I trust that pretious and blessed vigor, which shall quicken thē to eternall life; yet at the leastwise for the singular affection which they do beare towards others, take heed how they strike, least they wound whom they would not. For vndoubtedly it cutteth deeper thē they are aware of, whē they plead that euē such ceremonis of the church of Rome, as cōteine in thē nothing which is not of it selfe agreeable to the word of God, ought neuerthelesse to be abolished; and that neither the word of God, nor reason, nor the examples of the eldest Churches, do permit the Church of Rome to be therin followed. Heretiques they are, & they are our neighbors. By vs and amongst vs they lead their liues. But what then? Therfore no ceremony

of theirs lawfull for vs to vse? W

               ust yeeld and will that none are lawfull,T.C. lib. 1. p. 89. & 131. if God himself be a precedēt against the vse of any. But how appeareth it that God is so? Hereby they say it doth appeare, in that God seuered his people from the Heathens, but specially from the Aegyptians, and such nations as were neerest neighbors vnto them, by forbidding them to do those things,Leuit. 18.3. which were in themselues very lawfull to be done, yea very profitable some and incommodious to be forborne: such things it pleased God to forbid them, only because those Heathens did them, with whom conformity in the same things might haue bred infection. Thus in shauing, cutting, apparell wearing,
               Leuit. 19.27. Leuit. 19.19. 
               yea in sundry kinds of meates also, swines flesh, conies, and such like, they were forbidden to do so and so, because the Gentiles did so. And the end why God forbad them such things was,
               Deut. 22.11. Deut. 14.7. & Leuit. 11. 
               to seuer them for feare of infection by a great and an high wall from other nations,
               Ephes. 2.14. 
               as S. Paul teacheth. The cause of more carefull separation from the neerest nations, was the greatnesse of danger to be especially by them infected. Now Papists are to vs as those nations were vnto Israell. Therefore if the wisdome of God be our guide, we cannot allow conformity with them, no not in any such indifferent ceremonie. Our direct answer hereunto is, that for any thing here alleaged we may still doubt, whether the Lord in all such indifferēt ceremonies as those whereof we dispute, did frame his people of set purpose vnto any vtter dissimilitude, either with Aegyptians, or with any other nation else. And if God did not forbid them all such indifferent ceremonies; then our conformity with the Church of Rome in some such is not hitherto as yet disproued, although Papists were vnto vs as those heathens were vnto Israell. After the doings of the land of Aegypt,
               Leuit. 18.3. 
               wherein you dwelt, ye shall not do, saith the Lord; and after the maner of the land of Canaan, whether I will bring you, shall ye not do, neither walke in their ordinances: Do after my iudgements, and keepe my ordinances to walke therein: I am the Lord your God. The speech is indefinite, ye shall not be like them: It is not generall, ye shall not be like them in any thing, or like vnto them in any thing indifferent, or like vnto them in any indifferent ceremony of theirs. Seeing therefore it is not set downe how farre the bounds of his speech concerning dissimilitude should reach; how can any man assure vs, that it extēdeth farder then to those things only, wherin the nations there mentioned were idolatrous, or did against that which the law of God commandeth? Nay doth it not seem a thing very probable, that God doth purposely adde, Do after my iudgements; as giuing therby to vnderstād, that his meaning in the former sentence was but to bar similitude in such things, as were repugnant vnto the ordinances, lawes and statutes which he had giuen▪ Aegyptians and Cananites are for example sake named vnto them, because the customes of the one they had bin, and of the other they should be best acquainted with. But that wherein they might not be like vnto either of them, was such peraduenture as had beene no whit lesse vnlawfull, although those nations had neuer bene. So that there is no necessitie to thinke, that God for feare of infection by reason of neernes forbad them to be like to the Cananites or the Aegyptians, in those things which otherwise had bene lawfull enough. For I would know what one thing was in those nations, and is here forbidden, being indifferent in it self, yet forbidden onely because they vsed it. In the laws of Israel we find it written,Leuit. 19.27. 
               ye shal not cut round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou teare the tufts of thy beard. These things were vsuall amongst those nations, & in themselues they are indifferent. But are they

indifferent being vsed as signes of immoderate and hopeles lamentation for the dead? In this sense it is that the law forbiddeth them. For which cause the very next words following are,Leuit. 21.5. 
               ye shal not cut your flesh for the dead, nor make any print of a marke vpon you; I am the Lord. The like in Leuiticus, where speech is of mourning for the dead,Deut. 14.1. 
               They shal not make bald parts vpō their head, nor shaue off the locks of their beard, nor make any cutting in their flesh. Againe in Deuteronomy, ye are the children of the Lord your God; ye shal not cut your selues, nor make you baldnes betweene your eyes for the dead. What is this but in effect the same which the Apostle doth more plainly expresse,1. Thes. 4.13. saying, Sorrow not as they do which haue no hope? The very light of nature it selfe was able to see herein a fault; that which those nations did vse, hauing bin also in vse with others, the ancient Romane laws do forbid. That shauing therefore and cutting which the law doth mention, was not a matter in it selfe indifferent, and forbidden onely because it was in vse amongst such idolaters as were neighbours to the people of God; but to vse it had bin a crime, though no other people or nation vnder heauen should haue done it sauing only themselues. As for those laws concerning attire,Leuit. 19.19. 
               There shall no garment of linnen & wollen come vpon thee;Deut. 22.11. as also those touching food and diet, wherein swines flesh together with sundry other meates are forbidden; the vse of these things had bene indeed of it selfe harmelesse and indifferent: so that hereby it doth appeare, how the law of God forbad in some speciall consideration, such things as were lawful inough in themselues.Deut. 14.7. But yet euen here they likewise faile of that they intend. For it doth not appeare,Leuit. 11. that the consideration in regard whereof the law forbiddeth these things▪ was because those nations did vse them. Likely enough it is that the Cananites vsed to feed as well on sheepes as on swines flesh; & therefore if the forbidding of the later had no other reason thē dissimilitude with that people, they which of their own heads alleage this for reason,Leuit. 19.19. can shew I think some reason more thē we are able to find, why the former was not also forbiddē. Might there not be some other mystery in this prohibition then they think of? Yes, some other mystery there was in it by all likelihood. For what reason is there which should but induce,Deut. 14. Leuit. 11. and therefore much lesse enforce vs to thinke, that care of dissimilitude betweene the people of God & the heathen nations about thē, was any more the cause of forbidding them to put on garments of sundry stuffe, then of charging them withall not to sow their fields with mesline; or that this was any more the cause of forbidding them to eate swines flesh, then of charging them withall not to eate the flesh of Eagles, Haukes, and the like? Wherefore although the Church of Rome were to vs, as to Israell the Aegyptians and Cananites were of old;Eph. 2.14. yet doth it not follow, that the wisedome of God without respect doth teach vs to erect betweene vs and them a partition wall of difference, in such things indifferent as haue bene hitherto disputed of.
            7 Neither is the example of the eldest Churches a whit more auaileable to this purpose.That the exā
                  ple of the eldest Churches is not herein against vs. Notwithstanding some fault vndoubtedly there is in the very resemblance of Idolaters. Were it not some kind of blemish to be like vnto Infidels and Heathens,T.C. l. 1. p. 132. The Councels although they did not obserue themselues alwaies in making of decrees this rule, yet haue kept this consideration continually in making of their lawes, that they would haue the Christians differ from others in their ceremonies.
                it would not so vsually be obiected; men would not thinke it any aduantage in the causes of Religion, to be able therewith iustly to charge their aduersaries as they do. Wherefore to the ende that it may a little more plainely appeare, what force this hath, and how farre the same extendeth; we are to note howe all men are naturally desirous, that they may

seeme neither to iudge, not to do

               s▪ staine to the beauty of nature, for which cause it blusheth thereat, but glorieth in the contrary. From thence it riseth, that they which disgrace or depresse the credit of others, do it either in bothe or in one of these. To haue bene in either directed by a weake and vnperfect rule, argueth imbecillity and imperfection. Men being either led by reason, or by imitation of other mens example; if their persons be odious whose example we choose to follow, as namely if we frame our opinions to that which condemned heretiques thinke, or direct our actions according to that which is practised and done by them; it lieth as an heauy preiudice against vs, vnlesse somewhat mightier then their bare example, did moue vs to thinke or do the same things with thē. Christian mē therfore hauing besides the common light of all men so great helpe of heauenly directions from aboue, together with the lampes of so bright examples as the Church of God doth yeeld; it cannot but worthily seeme reprochfull for vs, to leaue both the one and the other, to become disciples vnto the most hatefull sort that liue, to do as they do, onely because we see their example before vs and haue a delight to follow it. Thus we may therefore safely conclude, that it is not euill simply to concurre with the Heathens either in opinion or in action: and that conformitie with them is onely then a disgrace, when either we follow them in that they thinke and do amisse, or followe them generally in that they do, without other reason then only the liking we haue to the paterne of their example; which liking doth intimate a more vniuersall approbation of them then is allowable.

Augustines defence in behalfe of bothe is, that touching the matters of action, Iewes & Catholique Christians were free frō the Gentiles faultines, euen in those things which were obiected as tokens of their agreemēt with the Gentiles; & concerning their consent in opinion, they did not hold the same with Gentils because Gentils had so taught, but because heauen & earth had so witnessed the same to be truth, that neither the one sort could erre in being fully perswaded thereof, nor the other but erre in case they should not consent with them. In things of their owne nature indifferent, if either Coūcels or particular mē haue at any time with sound iudgement misliked conformity betweene the Church of God & Infidels, the cause therof hath bin somwhat else then only affectation of dissimilitude. They saw it necessary so to do,T.C. l. 1. p. 132. Also it was decreed in

                in respect of some speciall accident; which the Church being not alwaies subiect vnto, hath not stil cause to do the like. For exāple, in the dangerous daies of trial,

wherein there was no way for the truth of Iesus Christ to triumph ouer infidelitie, but through the constancy of his Saints whom yet a naturall desire to saue themselues from the flame, might peraduenture cause to ioyne with Pagans in externall customes, too farre vsing the same as a cloake to conceale themselues in, and a mist to darken the eyes of Infidels withall: for remedy hereof, those lawes it might be were prouided, which forbad that Christians should decke their houses with boughes as the Pagans did vse to do, or rest those festiuall dayes whereon the Pagans rested, or celebrate such feasts as were, though not Heathenish, yet such that the simpler sort of Heathens might be beguiled in so thinking thē.T.C. l. 3. p. 132 Tertul. saith, O sayth he, better is the religion of the Heathen; for they vse no solemnitie of the Christians, neither the Lords day, neither, &c: but we are not afraid to be called Heathen.
                As for Tertullians iudgement concerning the rites and orders of the Church, no man hauing iudgement can be ignorant how iust exceptions may be taken against it. His opinion touching the Catholike Church was as vnindifferent, as touching our Church the opinion of them that fauour this pretended reformation is. He iudged all them who did not Montanize, to be but carnally minded, he iudged them still ouer-abiectly to fawne vpon the Heathens, and to curry fauour with Infidels. Which as the Catholique Church did well prouide that they might not do indeed, so Tertullian oueroften through discontentment carpeth iniuriously at them, as though they did it euen when they were free from such meaning. But if it were so that either the iudgement of those counsels before alleaged, or of Tertullian himselfe against the Christians,T.C. l. 1. p. 133.

                      people afterwards, to put as much difference as can be commodiously betweene the people of God and others which are not; I shall not, &c.
                are in no such consideration to be vnderstood as we haue mentioned; if it were so that men are condemned as well of the one as of the other, onely for vsing the ceremonies of a religion contrary vnto their owne; & that this cause is such as ought to preuaile no lesse with vs then with them; shall it not follow that seeing there is still betweene our religion and Paganisme the selfe same contrarietie, therefore we are still no lesse rebukeable, if we now decke our houses with boughes, or send New yeares-gifts vnto our friends, or feast on those dayes which the Gentiles then did, or sit after prayer as they were accustomed? For so they inferre vpon the premises, that as great difference as commodiously may be, there should be in all outward ceremonies betweene the people of God and them which are not his people. Againe they teach as hath bene declared, that there is not as great a difference as may be betweene them, except the one do auoide whatsoeuer rites and ceremonies vncommanded of God the other doth embrace. So that generally they teach, that the very difference of spirituall condition it selfe betweene the seruants of Christ and others, requireth such difference in ceremonies betweene them, although the one be neuer so farre disioyned in time or place from the other. But in case the people of God and Belial do chaunce to be neighbours; then as the daunger of infection is greater, so the same difference they say is thereby made more necessary. In this respect as the Iewes were seuered from the Heathen, so most especially from the Heathen neerest them. And in the same respect we, which ought to differ howsoeuer from the Church of Rome, are now they say by reason of our meerenesse more bound to differ from them in ceremonies then from Turkes. A straunge kind of speech vnto Christian eares, and such as I hope they themselues do acknowledge vnaduisedly vttered. We are not so much to feare infection from Turkes as from Papists. What of that? we must remember that by

conforming rather our selues in that respect to Turkes, we should be spreaders of a worse infection into others▪ then any we are likely to draw from Papists by our conformity with them in ceremonies. If they did hate as Turkes do, the Christians; or as Cananites of old did the Iewish religion euen in grosse; the circumstance of locall neernes in them vnto vs, might happily enforce in vs a duty of greater separation from them, then from those other mentioned. But for as much as Papists are so much in Christ neerer vnto vs then Turkes, is there any reasonable man trow you, but will iudge it meeter that our ceremonies of Christian religion should be Popish then Turkish or Heathenish? Especially considering that we were not brought to dwell amongst them (as Israell in Canaan) hauing not bene of them. For euen a very part of them we were. And when God did by his good Spirit put it into our hearts, first to reforme our selues, (whence grew our separation) and then by all good meanes to seeke also their reformation; had we not onely cut off their corruptions, but also estranged our selues from them in things indifferent; who seeth not how greatly preiudiciall this might haue bene to so good a cause, and what occasion it had giuen them to thinke (to their greater obduration in euill) that through a froward or wanton desire of innouation, wee did vnconstrainedly those thinges, for which conscience was pretended? Howsoeuer the case doth stand, as Iuda had beene rather to choose conformity in things indifferent with Israell when they were neerest opposites, then with the farthest remoued Pagans: So we in like case, much rather with Papists then with Turkes. I might adde further for more full and complete answere, so much concerning the large oddes betweene the case of the eldest Churches in regard of those Heathens, and ours in respect of the Church of Rome, that very cauillation it selfe should be satisfied, and haue no shift to flye vnto.
            8 But that no one thing may deteine vs ouer long,That it is not our best policy for the establishment of sound religion▪ to haue in these thinges no agreement with the Church of Rome being vnsound. I returne to their reasons against our conformity with that Church. That extreme dissimilitude which they vrge vpon vs, is now commended as our best & safest policie for establishment of sound religion. The ground of which politique position is, that Euils must be cured by their contraries; & therfore the cure of the Church infected with the poyson of Antichristianity, must be done by that which is therunto as cōtrary as may be. A medled estate of the orders of the Gospell & the ceremonies of popery, is not the best way to banish popery. We are cōtrarywise of opiniō, that he which will perfectly recouer a sicke, and restore a diseased body vnto health, must not endeuor so much to bring it to a state of simple cōtrariety, as of fit proportion in contrariety vnto those euils which are to be cured.T.C. l. 1. p. 132 Common reason also doth teach, that contraries are cured by their contraries. Now Christianity, and Antichristianity, the Gospell and Popery▪ be contra
                     
                        •
                     ies, and therefore Antichristianitie must be cured, not by itselfe, but by that which is (as much as may be) contrary vnto it.
                He that will take away extreme heat, by setting the body in extremity of cold, shall vndoubtedly remoue the disease, but together with it the diseased too. The first thing therefore in skilfull cures, is the knowledge of the part affected; the next is of the euill which do affect it; the last is not onely of the kind, but also of the measure of contrary things whereby to remoue it. They which measure religion by dislike of the Church of Rome, thinke euery man so much the more sound; by how much he can make the corruptions thereof to seeme more large. And therefore some there are, namely the Arrians in reformed Churches of Poland,

which imagine the cancre to haue eaten so far into the very bones and marrow of the Church of Rome, as if it had not so much as a sound beliefe, no not cōcerning God himselfe, but that the very beliefe of the Trinity were a part of Antichristian corruption; and that the wonderfull prouidence of God did bring to passe, that the Bishop of the Sea of Rome should be famous for his triple crowne; a sensible marke whereby the world might know him to be that mysticall beast spoken of in the Reuelation, to be that great and notorious Antichrist in no one respect so much, as in this that he maintaineth the doctrine of the Trinity. Wisdome therefore and skill is requisite to knowe, what parts are sound in that Church, and what corrupted. Neither is it to all men apparant which complaine of vnsound parts, with what kind of vnsoundnesse euery such part is possessed. They can say that in Doctrine, in Discipline, in Prayers, in Sacraments, the Church of Rome hath (as it hath in deede) very foule and grosse corruptions: the nature whereof notwithstanding because they haue not for the most part exact skill and knowledge to discerne, they thinke that amisse many times which is not, and the salue of reformation they mightily call for; but where and what the sores are which need it, as they wote full little, so they thinke it not greatly materiall to search. Such mens contentment must be wrought by stratageme: the vsuall methode of art is not for them. But with those that professe more then ordinary & common knowledge of good from euill, with them that are able to put a difference betweene things naught, & things indifferent in the Church of Rome, we are yet at controuersie about the maner of remouing that which is naught: whether it may not be perfectly helpt, vnlesse that also which is indifferent be cut off with it, so farre till no rite or ceremony remaine which the Church of Rome hath, being not found in the word of God. If we thinke this to extreme,T.C. l. 1. p.132. If a man would bring a drunken man to sobrietie, the best and nearest way is to carry him as farre from his excesse in drinke as may be: and if a man could not keepe a meane, it were better to fault in prescribing lesse them he should drinke, thē to fault in giuing him more then he ought. As we see to bring a sticke which is crooked to be straight, we do not only how it so farre vntill it come to be straight, but we bend it so farre vntill we make it so crooked of the other side, as it was before of the first side; to this end that at the last it may stand straight, and as it were in the midway betweene both the crookes.
                they reply that to draw mē frō great excesse, it is not amisse though we vse them vnto somewhat lesse then is competent; & that a crooked stick is not stieightned vnlesse it be bent as farre on the cleane contrary side, that so it may settle it selfe at the length in a middle estate of euennes between both. But how can these cōparisons stand them in any steed? When they vrge vs to extreme opposition against the Church of Rome, do they meane we should be drawne vnto it onely for a time, and afterwards returne to a mediocrity? or was it the purpose of those reformed churches, which vtterly abolished all popish ceremonies, to come in the end back againe to the middle point of euennesse and moderation? Then haue we conceiued amisse of their meaning. For we haue alwaies thought their opinion to be, that vtter inconformity with the Church of Rome was not an extremity wherunto we should be drawne for a time, but the very mediocrity it selfe wherein they meant we should euer continue. Now by these comparisons it seemeth cleane contrarie, that howsoeuer they haue bent themselues at first to an extreme contrariety against the Romish Church, yet therin they wil continue no longer then only till such time as some more moderate course for establishmēt of the Church may be concluded. Yea, albeit this were not at the first their intent, yet surely now there is great cause to

leade thē vnto it. They haue seene that experience of the former policie, which may cause the authors of it to hang downe their heads. When Germany had strickē off that which appeared corrupt in the doctrine of the Church of Rome▪ but seemed neuerthelesse in discipline still to reteine therewith very great conformitie: Fraunce by that rule of policie which hath bene before mentioned, tooke away the Popish orders which Germany did reteine. But processe of time hath brought more light vnto the world; whereby men perceiuing that they of the religion in France haue also reteined some orders which were before in the Church of Rome, and are not commaunded in the word of God; there hath arisen a sect in England, which following still the very selfe same rule of policie, seeketh to reforme euen the French reformation, and purge out from thence also dregs of Popery. These haue not taken as yet such roote that they are 
                  •
               able to establish any thing. But if they had, what would spring out of their stocke, and how farre the vnquiet wit of man might be caried with rules of such policie, God doth know. The triall which we haue liued to see, may somewhat teach vs what posteritie is to feare. But our Lord of his infinite mercie, auert whatsoeuer euill our swaruings on the one hand or on the other may threaten vnto the state of his Church.
            9 That the Church of Rome doth hereby take occasion to blaspheme,That we are not to abolish our Ceremonies, either because Papists vpbraide vs as hauing taken from them▪ or for that they are sayd hereby to conceiue I know not what great hopes. and to say our religion is not able to stand of it selfe, vnlesse it leane vpon the staffe of their Ceremonies,T.C. l. 3. p. 178.

                is not a matter of so great momēt, that it did need to be obiected, or doth deserue to receiue answer. The name of blasphemy in this place, is like the shoe of Hercules on a childs foote. If the Church of Rome do vse any such kind of silly exprobration, it is no such ougly thing to the eare, that we should thinke the honour and credite of our religion to receiue thereby any great wound. They which hereof make so perilous a matter, do seeme to imagine, that we haue erected of late a frame of some new religion; the furniture whereof we should not haue borrowed from our enemies, least they relieuing vs might afterwards laugh and gibe at our pouerty: whereas in truth the Ceremonies which we haue taken from such as were before vs, are not things that belong to this or to that sect, but they are the auncient rites and customes of the Church of Christ; whereof our selues being a part, we haue the selfe same interest in them which our fathers before vs had, from whom the same are descended vnto vs. Againe in case we had bene so much beholding priuately vnto them, doth the reputation of one Church stand by saying vnto another, I need thee not? If some should be so vrine and impotent, as to marre a benefite with reprochfull vpbraiding, where at the least they suppose themselues to haue bestowed some good turne; yet surely a wise bodies part it were not, to put out his fire, because his fond and foolish neighbour, from whom he borrowed peraduenture wherewith to kindle it, might happily cast him therewith in the teeth, saying, were it not for me thou wouldest freeze, and not be able to heate thy selfe. As for that other argument deriued from the secret affection of Papists, with whom our conformitie in certaine Ceremonies is sayd to put them in great hope,

that their whole religion in time will haue reentrance;T.C. l. 1. p. 179. To proue the Papists triumph and ioy in these things, I alleaged further that there are 
                        •
                     o
                        •
                     e which make such clamors for these ceremonies, as the Papists and those which they suborne.
                and therefore none are so clamorous amongst vs for the obseruation of these Ceremonies, as Papists and such as Papists suborne to speake for them, whereby it clearely appeareth how much they reioyce, how much they triumph in these things; our aunswere hereunto is still the same, that the benefite we haue by such ceremonies ouerweigheth euen this also. No man which is not exceeding partiall can well deny, but that there is most iust cause wherefore we should be offended greatly at the Church of Rome. Notwithstanding at such times as we are to deliberate for our selues, the freer our minds are from all distempered affections, the sounder & better is our iudgemēt. When we are in a fretting mood at the Church of Rome, and with that angry disposition enter into any cogitation of the orders & rites of our Church; taking particular suruey of them, we are sure to haue alwayes one eye fixed vpon the countenance of our enemies, and according to the blith or heauy aspect thereof, our other eye sheweth some other sutable token either of dislike or approbation towards our owne orders. For the rule of our iudgement in such case being onely that of Homer,
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                
               This is the thing which our enemies would haue; what they seeme contented with, euen for that very cause we reiect; & there is nothing but it pleaseth vs much the better, if we espy that it gauleth them. Miserable were the state & condition of that Church, the waighty affaires whereof should be ordered by those deliberations, wherein such an humor as this were perdominant. We haue most heartily to thanke God therefore, that they amongst vs to whom the first consultations of causes of this kind fell, were men which aiming at another marke, namely the glorie of God and the good of this his Church, tooke that which they iudged thereunto necessary, not reiecting any good or conuenient thing, onely because the Church of Rome might perhaps like it. If we haue that which is meere and right, although they be glad, we are not to enuie them this their solace; we do not thinke it a duty of ours, to be in euery such thing their tormentors. And whereas it is said,T.C. l. 3. p. 179. Thus they conceiuing hope of hauing the rest of their poperie in the end▪ it causeth them to be more frozen in their wickednesse, &c. For not the cause, but the occasion also ought to be taken away, &c. Although let the reader iudge, whether they haue cause giuen to hope that the tails of Popery yet remaining▪ they shall the easilier hale in the whole body after: considering also that Maister Bucer noteth, that where these things haue bene left, there Popery hath returned: but on the other part in places which haue bene clensed of these dregs, it hath not bin seene that it hath had any entrance.
                that Popery for want of this vtter extirpation hath in some places taken roote and florished againe, but hath not beene able to reestablish it selfe in any place, after prouision made against it by vtter euacuation of all Romish ceremonies; and therefore as long as we hold any thing like vnto them, we put them in some more hope, then if all were taken away; as we deny not but this may be true, so being of two euils to chuse the lesse, we hold it better, that the friends and fauorers of the Church of Rome, should be in some kind of hope to haue a corrupt religion restored, then both we and they conceiue iust feare, least vnder colour of rooting out Popery, the most effectuall meanes to beare vp the state of religion be remooued, and so a way made either for Paganisme, or for extreme barbāritie to enter. If desire of weakening the hope of others should turne vs away from the course we haue taken; how much more the care of preuenting our owne feare withhold vs from that wee are vrged vnto? Especially seeing that our owne feare we knowe, but wee are not so certaine what hope the

rites and orders of our Church haue bred in the hearts of others. For it is no sufficient argument thereof to say, that in maintaining and vrging these ceremonies none are so clamorous as Papists, and they whom Papists suborne; this speech being more hard to iustifie then the former, and so their proofe more doubtfull then the thing it selfe which they proue. He that were certaine that this is true, must haue marked who they be that speake for Ceremonies; he must haue noted who amongst them doth speake oftnest, or is most earnest; he must haue bene both acquainted throughly with the religion of such, and also priuy what conferences or compacts are passed in secret betweene them and others; which kinds of notice are not wont to be vulgar and common. Yet they which alleage this, would haue it taken as a thing that needeth no proofe, a thing which all men know and see. And if so be it were graunted them as true, what gaine they by it? Sundry of them that be Popish are eger in maintenance of Ceremonies. Is it so strange a matter to find a good thing furthered by ill men of a sinister intent and purpose, whose forwardnesse is not therefore a bridle to such as fauour the same cause with a better and sincerer meaning? They that seeke, as they say, the remouing of all Popish orders out of the Church, and reckon the state of Bishop in the number of those orders, do (I doubt not) presume that the cause which they prosecute is holy. Notwithstanding it is their owne ingenuous acknowledgement, that euen this very cause which they terme so often by an excellency, The Lords cause, is gratissima, most acceptable vnto some which hope for pray and spoile by it, and that our age hath store of such,

               and that such are the very sectaries of Dionysius the famous Atheist. Now if hereupon we should vpbraide them with irreligious, as they do vs with superstitious fauourers; if we should follow them in their owne kind of pleading and say, that the most clamorous for this pretended reformation, are either Atheists, or else proctors suborned by Atheists; the answer which herein they would make vnto vs, let them apply vnto themselues, and there an end. For they must not forbid vs to presume, or cause in defence of our Church-orders, to be as good as theirs against them, till the contrary be made manifest to the world.

                   And afterwards, such godly brethren are not easily to be grieued, which they seeme to be when they are thus martyred in their minds, for ceremonies which (to speake the best of them) are vnprofitable.
                
               The griefe which they say godly brethren conceiue, in regard of such Ceremonies as we haue common with the Church of Rome.that any good and godly mind should be grieued with that which is done. But to remedy their griefe, lieth not so much in vs as in themselues. They do not wish to be made glad with the hurt of the Church: and to remoue all out of the Church, whereat they shew themselues to be sorrowfull, would be as we are perswaded hurtfull, if not pernitious thereunto. Till they be able to perswade the contrary, they must and will I doubt not find out some other good meanes to cheere vp themselues. Amongst which meanes the example of Geneua may serue for one. Haue not they the old Popish custome of vsing Godfathers and Godmothers in Baptisme; the old Popish custome of administring the blessed Sacrament of the holy Eucharist with Wafer cakes? Those thing
                  •
                the godly there can digest. Wherefore should not the godly here learne to do the like, both in them and in the rest of the like nature? Some further meane peraduenture it might be to asswage their griefe, if so be they did cōsider the reuenge they

take on them, which haue bene, as they interpret it, the workers of their continuance in so great griefe so long. For if the maintenance of Ceremonies be a corrosiue to such as oppugne them; vndoubtedly to such as mainteine them, it can be no great pleasure, when they behold how that which they reuerence is oppugned. And therefore they that iudge themselues Martyrs when they are grieued, should thinke withall what they are when they grieue. For we are still to put them in mind that the cause doth make no difference; for that it must be presumed as good at the least on our part as on theirs, till it be in the end decided who haue stood for truth and who for error. So that till then the most effectuall medicine and withall the most sound to ease their griefe, must not be (in our opinion) the taking away of those things whereat they are grieued, but the altering of that perswasion which they haue concerning the same. For this we therefore both pray and labour; the more because we are also perswaded, that it is but conceipt in them to thinke, that those Romish Ceremonies whereof we haue hetherto spoken,T.C. l. 3. p. 171 Although the corruptions in them sticke not straight to the heart, yet as gentle poysons they consume by little and little.
                are like leprous clothes, infectious vnto the Church, or like soft and gentle poysons, the venome whereof being insensibly pernicious, worketh death, and yet is neuer felt working. Thus they say: but because they say it onely, and the world hath not as yet had so great experience of their art in curing the diseases of the Church, that the bare authoritie of their word should perswade in a cause so waightie; they may not thinke much if it be required at their hands to shewe, first, by what meanes so deadly infection can growe from similitude betweene vs and the Church of Rome in these thinges indifferent; Secondly, for that it were infinite if the Church should prouide against euery such euill as may come to passe, it is not sufficient that they shewe possibilitie of dangerous euent, vnlesse there appeare some likelihood also of the same to follow in vs, except we preuent it, Nor is this inough, vnlesse it be moreouer made plaine, that there is no good and sufficient way of preuention, but by euacuating cleane, and by emptying the Church of euerie such rite and Ceremonie, as is presently called in question. Till this be done, their good affection towards the safety of the Church is acceptable, but the way they prescribe vs to preserue it by must rest in suspense. And least hereat they take occasion to turne vpon vs the speech of the Prophet Ieremie vsed against Babylon,

               Behold we haue done our endeuour to cure the diseases of Babylon, but she through her wilfulnesse doth rest vncured: let them consider into what straights the Church might driue it selfe, in being guided by this their counsell. Their axiome is, that the sound beleeuing Church of Iesus Christ, may not be like Hereticall Churches in any of those indifferent things, which men make choyce of, and do not take by prescript appointment of the word of God. In the word of God the vse of bread is prescribed, as a thing without which the Eucharist may not be celebrated: but as for the kind of bread, it is not denied to be a thing indifferent. Being indifferent of it selfe, we are by this axiome of theirs to auoide the vse of vnleauened bread in their Sacrament, because such bread the Church of Rome beeing Hereticall vseth. But doth not the selfe same axiome barre vs euen from leauened bread also, which the Church of the Grecians vseth; the opinions whereof are in a number of things the same, for which we condemne the Church of Rome; and in some

things erroneous, where the Church of Rome is acknowledged to be sound; as namely in the Article proceeding of the holy Ghost? And least here they should say that because the Greeke Church is farther off, & the Church of Rome nearer, we are in that respect rather to vse that which the Church of Rome vseth not; let them imagine a reformed Church in the Citie of Venice, where a Greeke Church and a Popish both are. And when both these are equally neare, let them consider what the third shall doe. Without eyther leauened or vnleauened bread, it can haue no sacrament: the word of God doth tye it to neither; and their axiome doth exclude it from both. If this constraine them, as it must, to grant that their axiome is not to take any place, saue in those things only where the Church hath larger scope; it resteth that they search out some stronger reason then they haue as yet alleaged; otherwise they constraine not vs to thinke that the Church is tyed vnto any such rule or axiome, no not then when she hath the widest field to walke in, and the greatest store of choice.
            11 Against such Ceremonies generally as are the same in the Church of England and of Rome, we see what hath bene hetherto alleaged.Their exception against such Ceremonies as we haue receiued from the Church of Rome, that church hauing taken them frō the Iewes.
                Albeit therefore we do not finde the one Churches hauing of such thinges, to be sufficient cause why the other should not haue them: neuerthelesse in case it may be proued, that amongst the number of rites and orders common vnto bothe, there are particulars the vse whereof is vtterly vnlawfull, in regard of some speciall bad and noysome qualitie; there is no doubt but we ought to relinquish such rites and orders, what freedome soeuer we haue to retaine the other still. As therefore wee haue heard their generall exception against all those thinges, which being not commanded in the word of God, were first receiued in the Church of Rome, and from thence haue bene deriued into ours, so it followeth th
                  •
               t now we proceede vnto certaine kinds of them, as being excepted against not only for that they are in the Church of Rome, but are besides either Iewish, or abused vnto Idolatry, and so growne scandalous. The Church of Rome they say,Eccles. discisol. 98. And T.C. l. 3. p. 181. Many of these popish ceremonies fault by reason of the pompe in them; where they should be agreeable to the simplicitie of the Gospel of Christ crucified.
                 being ashamed of the simplicitie of the Gospell, did almost out of all religions take whatsoeuer had any faire & gorgeous shew, borrowing in that respect frō the Iewes sundry of their abolished Ceremonies. Thus by foolish and ridiculous imitation, all their Massing furniture almost they tooke from the law, least hauing an Altar and a Priest, they should want vestments for their stage; so that whatsoeuer we haue in common with the church of Rome, if the same be of this kind we ought to remoue it. Constantine the Emperour speaking of the keeping of the feast of Easter saith, That it is an vnworthy thing to haue any thing common with that most spitefull company of the Iewes. And a little after he saith, that it is most absurd and against reason, that the Iewes should vaunt and glory that the Christians could not keepe those thinges without their doctrine.

               And in an other place it is said after this sort; It is conuenient so to order the matter, that we haue nothing common with that nation. The councell of Laodicea, which was afterward confirmed by the sixt generall Councell, decreed that the Christians should not take vnlea

                  ened bread of the Iewes, or communicate with their impietie. For the easier manifestation of truth in this point, two things there are which must be considered; namely the causes wherefore the church should decline from Iewish Ceremonies; and how farre it ought so to doe. One cause is that the Iewes were the deadliest and spitefullest enemies of Christianitie that were in the world, and in this respect

their orders so farre forth to be shunned, as we haue already set downe in handling the matter of heathenish Ceremonies. For no enemies being so venemous against Christ as Iewes, they were of all other most odious, and by that meane least to be vsed as fit Church paternes for imitation. An other cause is the solemne abrogation of the Iewes ordinances; which ordinances for vs to resume, were to checke our Lord himselfe which hath disanulled them. But how farre this second cause doth extend, it is not on all sides fully agreed vpon. And touching those thinges whereunto it reacheth not, although there be small cause wherefore the Church should frame it selfe to the Iewes example, in respect of their persons which are most hatefull; yet God himselfe hauing bene the author of their lawes, herein they are (notwithstanding the former consideration) still worthy to be honoured, and to be followed aboue others, as much as the state of things will beare. Iewish ordinances had some things naturall, and of the perpetuitie of those things no man doubteth. That which was positiue, wee likewise knowe to haue bene by the comming of Christ partly necessary not to bee kept, and partly indifferent to be kept or not. Of the former kinde Circumcision and sacrifice were. For this point Stephen was accused; and the euidence which his accusers brought against him in iudgement was, This man ceaseth not to speake blasphemous words against this holy place and the lawe,
               Act. 6.13, 14. 
               for we haue heard him say that this Iesus of Nazaret shall destroy this place, and shall change the ordinances that Moses gaue vs. True it is that this doctrine was then taught, which vnbeleeuers condemning for blasphemie, did therein commit that which they did condemne. The Apostles notwithstanding from whom Stephen had receiued it, did not so teach the abrogation, no not of those things which were necessarily to cease, but that euen the Iewes being Christian might for a time continue in them. And therefore in Ierusalem the first Christian Bishop not Circumcised was Marke;Vide Niceph. lib. 3 .cap. 25. & Sulpit, S

                  . and he not Bishop till the daies of Adrian the Emperour, after the ouerthrow of Ierusalem, there hauing bene fifteene Bishops before him which were all of the Circumcision. The Christian Iewes did thinke at the first not onely themselues, but the Christian Gentiles also bound, and that necessarily, to obserue the whole lawe. There went forth certaine of the sect of Pharises which did beleeue, and they comming vnto Antioch, taught that it was necessary for the Gentiles to be circumcised, and to keepe the lawe of Moses. Whereupon there grew dissention, Paul and Barnabas disputing against them. The determination of the Councell held at Ierusalem concerning this matter was finally this,Act. 21.25. 
               Touching the Gentils which beleeue, we haue written & determined that they obserue no such thing.
               Act. 15.24. Their protestation by letters is, For as much as we haue heard that certain which departed frō vs haue troubled you with words, and combred your minds, saying, Ye must be circumcised and keepe the lawe; knowe that we gaue them no such commandement. Paule therefore continued still teaching the Gentiles, not onely that they were not bound to obserue the lawes of Moses, but that the obseruation of those lawes which were necessarily to be abrogated, was in them altogether vnlawfull. In which point his doctrine was misreported, as though he had euery where preached this, not only concerning the Gentiles, but also touching the Iewes. Wherfore comming vnto Iames and the rest of the Cleargie at Ierusalem,
               Act. 21.20. they tolde him plainely of it, saying, Thou seest brother how many thousand Iewes there are which beleeue, & they are all zealous of the law. Now they

are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Iewes which are amongst the Gentiles to forsake Moses, and sayest that they ought not to circumcise their children neither to liue after the customes. And hereupon they gaue him counsell to make it apparent in the eyes of all men, that those flying reports were vntrue, and that himselfe being a Iew, kept the lawe euen as they did. In some thinges therefore wee see the Apostles did teach, that there ought not to be conformitie betweene the Christian Iewes and Gentiles. How many things this lawe of inconformitie did comprehend, there is no need we should stand to examine. This generall is true, that the Gentiles were not made conformable vnto the Iewes, in that which was necessarily to cease at the comming of Christ. Touching things positiue which might either cease or continue as occasion should require,Act. 15.28. the Apostles tendering the zeale of the Iewes, thought it necessary to binde euen the Gentiles for a time to abstaine as the Iewes did, frō things offered vnto idols, from bloud, frō strangled. These decrees were euery where deliuered vnto the Gentiles to bee straightly obserued and kept. In the other matters where the Gentiles were free,Act. 16.4. and the Iewes in their owne opinion still tied, the Apostles doctrine vnto the Iewe was, Condemne not the Gentile; vnto the Gentile, Despise not the Iewe:Rom. 14.10. the one sorte they warned to take heed that scrupulositie did not make them rigorous, in giuing vnaduised sentence against their brethren which were free; the other that they did not become scandalous, by abusing their libertie & freedome to the offence of their weake brethren which were scrupulous. From hence therefore two conclusiōs there are which may euidently be drawne; the first, that whatsouer conformitie of positiue lawes the Apostles did bring in betweene the Churches of Iewes and Gentiles, it was in those things only, which might either cease or continue a shorter or a longer time, as occasion did most require; the second, that they did not impose vpon the Churches of the Gentiles any part of the Iewes ordinances with bond of necessary and perpetuall obseruatiō, (as we al both by doctrine and practise acknowledge) but only in respect of the conueniencie and fitnes for the present state of the Church as thē it stood. The words of the Councels decree cōcerning the Gentiles are, It seemed good to the holy Ghost & to vs, to lay vpō you no more burden sauing only those things of necessitie, abstinence frō Idoll-offrings, frō strangled & bloud, and frō fornication. So that in other things positiue which the cōming of Christ did not necessarily extinguish, the Gentils were left altogether free. Neither ought it to seeme vnreasonable, that the Gentils should necessarily be bound & tied to Iewish ordinances, so far forth as that decree importeth. For to the Iew, who knew that their differēce frō other nations which were aliens & strangers frō God, did especially consist in this,Lib. qui Seder Olam inscribi
                     •
                  
                  tur. that Gods people had positiue ordināces giuen to thē of God himself, it seemed maruelous hard, that the Christiā Gentils should be incorporated into the same common welth with Gods owne chosen people, & be subiect to no part of his statutes,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                more then only the lawe of nature, which heathēs count thēselues boūd vnto. It was an opiniō constātly receiued amongst the Iews, that God did deliuer vnto the sonnes of Noah seuē precepts; namely to liue in some form of regimēt vnder 1 publique lawes; 2 to serue & call vpō the name of God; 3 to shun Idolatry; 4 not to suffer effusiō of bloud; 5 to abhor all vncleane knowledge in the flesh; 6 to commit no 
                  •
               apine; 7 finally, not to eate of any liuing creature whereof the bloud was not first let out. if

therefore the Gentiles would be exempt from the lawe of Moses, yet it might seeme hard they should also cast off euen those things positiue which were obserued before Moses, and which were not of the same kinde with lawes that were necessarily to cease. And peraduenture hereupon the Councell sawe it expedient to determine, that the Gentiles should according vnto the third, the seuenth, and the fift of those precepts, abstaine from things sacrificed vnto idoles, from strangled and bloud, and from fornication. The rest the Gentiles did of their owne accord obserue, nature leading them thereunto. And did not nature also teach them to abstaine from fornication? No doubt it did. Neither can we with reason thinke,Heb. 13.4. 1. Cor. 5.13. Gal. 5.19. that as the former two are positiue, so likewise this, being meant as the Apostle doth otherwise vsually vnderstand it. But very marriage within a number of degrees, being not onely by the lawe of Moses, but also by the lawe of the sonnes of Noah (for so they tooke it) an vnlawfull discouerie of nakednes; this discouerie of nakednesse by vnlawfull marriages, such as Moses in the lawe reckoneth vp,1. L
                     •
                  uit. 18. I thinke it for mine owne part more probable to haue bene meant in the wordes of that Canon, then fornication according vnto the sense of the lawe of nature. Words must be taken according to the matter wherof they are vttered. The Apostles commaund to abstaine from bloud. Conster this according to the lawe of nature, and it will seeme that Homicide only is forbidden. But conster it in reference to the law of the Iewes about which the question was, and it shall easily appeare to haue a cleane other sense, and in any mans iudgement a truer, when we expound it of eating, and not of sheading bloud. So if we speake of fornication, he that knoweth no lawe but only the lawe of nature, must needes make thereof a narrower construction, then he which measureth the same by a lawe, wherein sundry kindes euen of coniugall copulation are prohibited as impure,

If any do rather think that the Christian Gentiles themselues through the loose and corrupt custome of those times, tooke simple fornication for no sinne, and were in that respect offensiue vnto beleeuing Iewes which by the law had bene better taught; our proposing of an other coniecture, is vnto theirs no preiudice. Some thinges therefore we see there were, wherein the Gentiles were forbidden to be like vnto the Iewes; some things wherin they were commanded not to be vnlike. Againe, some things also there were, wherein no lawe of God did let, but that they might be either like or vnlike, as occasion should require.

               hath in such sort distinguished the mysteries of the old testament, that certaine of them it hath chosen out to benefit euangelicall knowledge withall, and for that purpose appointed that those things which before were Iewish, might now be Christian customes. The cause why the Apostles did thus conforme the Christians, as much as might be, according to the patterne of the Iewes, was to reine them in by this meane the more, and to make them cleaue the better. The Church of Christ hath had in no one thing so many and so contrary occasions of dealing as about Iudaisme; some hauing thought the whole Iewish lawe wicked and damnable in it selfe; some not condemning it as the former sort absolutely, haue notwithstanding iudged it either sooner necessary to be abrogated, or further vnlawful to be obserued then truth

can beare; some of scrupulous simplicitie vrging perpetuall and vniuersall obseruation of the law of Moses necessary, as the Christian Iewes at the first in the Apostles times; some as Heretiques, holding the same no lesse euen after the contrary determination set downe by consent of the Church at Ierusalem; finally some being herein resolute through meere infidelitie, and with open profest enmitie against Christ, as vnbeleeuing Iewes. To cōtrowle slaunderers of the law and Prophets, such as Marcionites and Manichees were, the Church in her liturgies hath intermingled with readings out of the new Testament, lessons taken out of the lawe and Prophets; whereunto Tertullian alluding,Tertull. de praescript. aduers. haeret. saith of the Church of Christ; It intermingleth with euangelicall and apostolicall writings, the law and the Prophets; and from thence it drinketh in that faith, which with water it sealeth,

               clotheth with the spirit, nourisheth with the Eucharist, with martirdom setteth forward. They would haue wondered in those times to heare, that any man being not a fauourer of heresie, should terme this by way of disdaine, mangling of the Gospels & Epistles. They which honor the law as an image of the wisdome of God himselfe, are notwithstanding to know that the same had an end in Christ. But what? was the lawe so abolished with Christ, that after his ascention the office of Priests became immediatly wicked, & the very name hatefull, as importing the exercise of an vngodly function? No, as long as the glory of the temple continued,
                  T.C. l. 1. p. 216 Seeing that the office and function of Priests was after our sauiour Christs ascēsion naught & vngodly; the name whereby they were called which did exercise that vngodly function, cannot be otherwise taken then in the euil part. and till the time of that finall desolation was accomplished, the very Christian Iewes did continue with their sacrifices and other parts of legall seruice. That very lawe therefore which our Sauiour was to abolish, did not so soone become vnlawfull to be obserued as some imagine: nor was it afterwards vnlawful so far, that the very name of Aultar, of Priest, of Sacrifice it selfe, should be banished out of the world. For thogh God do now hate sacrifice, whether it be Heathenish or Iewish, so that we cannot haue the same things which they had, but with impietie; yet vnlesse there be some greater let then the onely euacuation of the law of Moses, the names thē
               selues may (I hope) be retained without sin, in respect of that proportion which things established by our Sauiour haue vnto them which by him are abrogated. And so throughout all the writings of the auncient fathers we see that the words which were do continue; the onely difference is, that whereas before they had a literall, they now haue a metaphoricall vse, and are as so many notes of remembrance vnto vs, that what they did signifie in the letter, is accomplished in the truth. And as no man can depriue the Church of this libertie, to vse names whereunto the lawe was accustomed; so neither are wee generally forbidden the vse of things which the lawe hath; though it neither commaund vs any particularitie, as it did the Iewes a number; and the waightiest which it did commaund them, are vnto vs in the Gospell prohibited. Touching such as through simplicitie of error did vrge vniuersall and perpetuall obseruation of the lawe of Moses at the first, we haue spoken already. Against Iewish heretikes and false Apostles teaching afterwards the selfe same, Saint Paul in euery Epistle commonly either disputeth or giueth warning. Iewes that were zealous for the lawe, but withall infidels in respect of Christianitie, and to the name of Iesus Christ most spitefull enemies, did while they flourished no lesse persecute the Church then Heathens. After their estate was ouerthrowne, they were not that way so much to be feared. Howbeit because they had their Synagogues in euery

famous Citie almost throughout the world, and by that meanes great opportunitie to withdraw from the Christian faith, which to doe they spared no labor;Concil. Laod. Can.

Againe, From the Iewes men ought not to receiue their vnleauened, nor to communicate with their impieties. Which Councell was afterwardes indeede confirmed by the sixt generall Councell.

If these Canons were any argumēt, that they which made them did vtterly cōdemne similitude betweene the Christians & Iewes, in things indifferent appertaining vnto religiō, either because the Iewes were enemies vnto the Church, or else for that their ceremonies were abrogated; these reasons had bin as strong & effectual against their keeping the feast of Easter on the same day the Iewes kept theirs, and not according to the custome of the West Church. For so they did frō the first beginning till Constantines time. For in these two things the East & West churches did interchangeably both confront the Iewes, and concur with thē: the West church vsing vnleauened bread, as the Iewes in their passouer did, but differing frō them in the day whereon they kept the feast of Easter; con

               ariwise the East church celebrating the feast of Easter on the same day with the Iewes, but not vsing the same kind of bread which they did. Now if so be the East Church in vsing leuened bread had done wel, either for that the Iewes were enemies to the Church, or because Iewish ceremonies were abrogated; how should we think but that Victor the B. of Rome (whom all iudicious mē do in that behalf disallow) did well to be so vehement & fierce in drawing thē to the like dissimilitude for the feast of Easter? Againe, if the West Churches had in either of those two respects affected dissimilitude with the Iewes in the feast of Easter, what reasō had they to drawe the Easterne Church herein vnto them, which reason did not enforce them to frame themselues vnto it in the ceremonie of leauened bread? Differēce in rites should breed no cōtrouersie between one church & an other: but if controuersie be once bred, it must be ended. The feast of Easter being therfore litigious in the daies of Cōstantine, who honored of all other churches most the Church of Rome, which Church was the mother from whose breasts he had drawn that food, which gaue him nourishmēt to eternall life; sith agreement was necessary, and yet impossible, vnlesse the one part were yeelded vnto; his desire was that of the two the Easterne church should rather yeeld. And to this end he vseth sundry perswasiue speeches. When Stephen the Bi. of Rome going about to shew what the Catholique Church should do, had alleaged what the heritiques themselues did, namely that they receiued such as came vnto them, and offered

not to baptise them anew: S. Cyprian being of a contrary mind to him about the matter at that time questiō, which was, Whether heretikes conuerted ought to be rebaptised yea or no, answered the allegatiō of Pope Stephen with exceeding great stomack, saying, To this degree of wretchednes the church of God and Spouse of Christ is now come, that her wayes she frame

            12 But the waightiest exception, and of all the most worthy to be respected, is against such kind of ceremonies, as haue bene so grossely & shamefully abused in the Church of Rome,
               Their exception against such Ceremonies as haue bene abused by the church of Rome, and are said in that respect to be scandalous. that where they remaine they are scandalous, yea they cannot choose but be stumbling blockes and grieuous causes of offence. Concerning this point therefore we are first to note, what properly it is to be scandalous or offensiue; secondly what kinde of Ceremonies are such; and thirdly when they are necessarily for remedie therof to be taken away, and when not. The common conceipt of the vulgar sort is, whensoeuer they see any thing which they mislike and are anrgy at, to thinke that euery such thing is scandalous, and that themselues in this case are the men concerning whome our Sauiour spake in so fearefull manner, saying,Matth. 18.6. 
               Whosoeuer shall scandalize or offend any one of these little ones which beleeue in me [that is as they conster it, whosoeuer shall anger the meanest and simplest Artizan which carrieth a good minde, by not remouing out of the Church such rites and Ceremonies as displease him] better he were drowned in the bottom of the sea. But hard were the case of the church of Christ if this were to scandalize. Men are scandalized when they are moued, led, and prouoked vnto sinne. At good thinges euill men may take occasion to doe euill;1. Pet. 2.
                     •
                  . and so Christ himselfe was a rock of offence in Israel, they taking occasion at his poore estate, and at the ignominie of his crosse, to think him vnworthy the name of that great and glorious Messias, whom the Prophets describe in such ample & stately terms. But that which we therfore terme offensiue, because it inuiteth mē to offend, and by a dumb kind of prouocation incourage, thmoueth, or any way

leadeth vnto sinne, must of necessitie be acknowledged actiuely scandalous. Now some thinges are so euen by their very essence and nature, so that wheresoeuer they be found, they are not, neither can be without this force of provocation vnto euill; of which kinde all examples of sinne and wickednes are. Thus Dauid was scandalous in that bloudie acte, whereby he caused the enemies of God to be blasphemous: thus the whole state of Israell scandalous, when their publique disorders caused the name of God to be ill spoken of amongst the nations.2. Sam. 1
                     •
                  .14. Rom. 2.24. It is of this kind that Tertullian meaneth; Offence or scandall, if I be not deceaued saith he,Ezech. 36.20. Tertul. lib. de virgin▪ veland. 
               is when the example not of a good but of an euill thing, doth set men forward vnto sinne. Good things can scandalize none saue only euill mindes: good things haue no scandalizing nature in them. Yet that which is of it owne nature either good or at least not euill, may by some accident become scandalous at certain times, and in certaine places, and to certaine men, the open vse thereof neuerthelesse being otherwise without daunger. The verie nature of some rites and Ceremonies therfore is scandalous, as it was in a number of those which the Manichees did vse, and is in all such as the law of God doth forbid. Some are offensiue only through the agreement of men to vse them vnto euill, and not else; as the most of those thinges indifferent which the Heathens did to the seruice of their false Gods; which an other in heart condemning their idolatrie, could not doe with them in shew and token of approbation, without being guiltie of scandall giuen. Ceremonies of this kinde are either deuised at the first vnto euill; as the Eunomian Heretiques in dishonour of the blessed Trinitie, brought in the laying on of water but once, to crosse the custom of the Church, which in Baptisme did it thrise: or else hauing had a profitable vse, they are afterwards interpreted and wrested to the contrarie; as those Heretiques which held the Trinitie to be three distinct not persons but natures, abused the Ceremonie of three times laying on water in Baptisme vnto the strengthning of their heresie. The element of water is in Baptisme necessarie: once to lay it on or twice is indifferent.Epist. ad Lean drum Hisp. For which cause Gregorie making mention thereof, sayth; To diue an infant either thrice or but once in Baptisme, can be no way a thing reproueable; seeing that both in three times washing, the Trinitie of persons; and in one, the Vnitie of Godhead may be signified. So that of these two Ceremonies, neither being hurtfull in it selfe, both may serue vnto good purpose; yet one was deuised, and the other conuerted vnto euill. Now whereas in the Church of Rome certaine Ceremonies are said to haue bene shamefully abused vnto euill, as the Ceremonie of Crossing at Baptisme, of kneeling at the Eucharist, of vsing Wafer-cakes, and such like; the question is, whether for remedie of that euill wherein such Ceremonies haue bene scandalous, and perhaps may be still vnto some euen amongst our selues, whome the presence and sight of them may confirme in that former error whereto they serued in times past, they are of necessitie to be remoued. Are these or any other Ceremonies wee haue common with the Church of Rome, scandalous and wicked in their verie nature? This no man obiecteth. Are any such, as haue bene polluted from their verie birth, and instituted euen at the first vnto that thing which is euill? That which hath bene ordeyned impiously at the first, may weare out that impietie in tract of time; and then what doth let, but that the vse thereof may stand without offence. The names of our monethes and of our dayes, wee are not ignorant from

whence they came, and with what dishonour vnto God they are said to haue bene deuised at the first. What could be spoken against any thing more effectuall to stirre hatred, then that which sometime the auncient Fathers in this case speake? Yet those very names are at this day in vse throughout Christendome, without hurt or scandall to any.Hom 11. de Pasch.

Cleare and manifest it is; that thinges deuised by Heretiques, yea deuised of a very hereticall purpose euen against religion, and at their first deuising worthy to haue bene withstood, may in time growe meete to be kept; as that custome the inuentors wherof were the Eunomian Heretiques. So that customes once established and confirmed by long vse, being presently without harme, are not in regard of their corrupt originall to be held scandalous. But cōcerning those our Ceremonies, which they reckon for most Popish, they are not able to auouch that any of them was otherwise instituted; thē vnto good, yea so vsed at the first. It followeth then that they all are such, as hauing serued to good purpose, were afterward conuerted vnto the contrary. And sith it is not so much as obiected against vs, that we reteine together with them the euil, wherwith they haue bin infected in the Church of Rome; I would demand who they are whom we scandalize, by vsing harmles things vnto that good end for which they were first instituted. Amongst our selues that agree in the approbation of this kinde of good vse, no man wil say that one of vs is offensiue and scandalous vnto another. As for the fauorers of the church of Rome, they know how far we herein differ & dissent frō them; which thing neither we conceale; & they by their publike writings also professe daily how much it grieueth them; so that of thē there will not many rise vp against vs, as witnesses vnto the inditement of scandal, whereby we might be cōdemned & cast, as hauing strengthned thē in that euil wherwith they pollute themselues in the vse of the same Ceremonies. And concerning such as withstād the Church of England herein, & hate it because it doth not sufficiently seeme to hate Rome, they (I hope are far enough frō being by this meane drawne to any kind of popish error. The multitude therfore of them, vnto whom we are scādalous through the vse of abused ceremonies, is not so apparēt, that it can iustly be said in general of any one sort of mē or other, we cause thē to offend. If it be so that now or thē some few are espied, who hauing bin accustomed heretofore to the rites & ceremonies of the Church of Rome, are not so scowred of their former rust, as to forsake their auncient perswasiō which they haue had, howsoeuer they frame thēselues to outward obedience of laws & orders: because such may misconster the meaning of our ceremonies, and so take thē as though they were in euery sort the same they haue bin, shal this be thought a reason sufficiēt wheron to cōclude, that some law must necessarily be made to abolish al such ceremonies? They answer that there is no law of God which doth bind vs to reteine thē. And S. Pauls rule is, that in those things frō which without hurt we may lawfully absteine, we should frame the vsage of our libertie with regard to the weakenes and imbecillitie of our brethren. Wherefore vnto them which stood vpon their owne defence, saying, All things are lawfull vnto me; he replyeth,1. Cor. 6.12. 
               But all things are not expedient in regard of others. All things are cleane, all meates are

lawfull; but euill vnto that man that eateth offensiuely. If for thy meates 
                  •
               ake thy brother bee grieued,Rom. 14. Rom. 15.1. thou walkest no longer according to charitie. Destroy not him with thy meate for whome Christ dyed. Dissolue not for foodes sake the worke of God. Wee that are strong, must beare the imbecillities of the impotent, and not please our selues. It was a weakenesse in the Christian Iewes, and a maime of iudgement in them, that they thought the Gentiles polluted by the eating of those meates, which themselues were afraid to touch for feare of transgressing the lawe of Moses; yea hereat their hearts did so much rise, that the Apostle had iust cause to feare, least they would rather forsake Christianitie, then endure any fellowship with such, as made no cōscience of that which was vnto them abhominable. And for this cause mention is made of destroying the weake by meates, and of dissoluing the work of God, which was his church, a part of the liuing stones whereof were beleeuing Iewes. Now those weake brethren before mentioned are said to be as the Iewes were, and our ceremonies which haue bene abused in the Church of Rome, to be as the scandalous meates from which the Gentiles are exhorted to abstaine in the presence of Iewes, for feare of auerting them from Christian faith. Therefore as charitie did bind them to refraine frō that for their brethrens sake, which otherwise was lawfull enough for them; so it bindeth vs for our brethrens sake likewise to abolish such Ceremonies, although we might lawfully else retaine them. But betweene these two cases there are great oddes. For neither are our weake brethren as the Iewes, nor the ceremonies which we vse as the meates which the Gentiles vsed. The Iewes were knowne to be generally weake in that respect; whereas contrariwise the imbecillitie of ours is not common vnto so many, that we can take any such certaine notice of them. It is a chance if here and there some one be found; and therefore seeing we may presume men commonly otherwise, there is no necessitie that our practise should frame it selfe by that which th' Apostle doth prescribe to the Gentiles. Againe their vse of meates was not like vnto our of Ceremonies; that being a matter of priuate action in common life, where euery man was free to order that which himselfe did;Vide Harmenop. lib. 1. 
                     •

In this case therefore where any priuate harme doth growe, we are not to reiect instruction, as being an vnmeete plaster to apply vnto it; neither can wee say that hee which appointeth teachers for phisitians in this kind of euill,T.C. l. 3. p. 178 is as if a man would set one to watch a childe all day long least he should hurt himselfe with a knife, whereas by taking away the knife from him, the daunger is auoyded, and the seruice of the man better imployed. For a knife may be taken away from a childe, without depriuing them of the benefite thereof which haue yeares and discretion to vse it. But the Ceremonies which children doe abuse, if we remoue quite and cleane, as it is by some required that wee should; then are they not taken from children onely, but from others also; which is as though because children may perhaps hurt themselues with kniues, wee should conclude that therefore the vse of kniues is to bee taken quite and cleane euen from men also. Those particular Ceremonies which they pretend

to be so scandalous, we shall in the next booke haue occasion more throughly to sift, where other things also traduced in the publike duties of the Church whereunto each of these appertaineth, are together with these to be touched, and such reasons to be examined as haue at any time beene brought either against the one or the other. In the meane while against the conueniencie of curing such euils by instructiō,T.C. l. 3. p. 177. It is not so conuenient that the Minist

                strange it is that they should obiect the multitude of other necessary matters, wherin Preachers may better bestow their time, then in giuing men warning not to abuse Ceremonies; a wonder it is that they should obiect this, which haue so many yeares together troubled the Church with quarels concerning these things, and are euen to this very houre so earnest in them, that if they write or speake publiquely but fiue words, one of them is lightly about the dangerous estate of the Church of England in respect of abused ceremonies. How much happier had it bene for this whole Church, if they which haue raised contention therein about the abuse of rites and Ceremonies, had considered in due time that there is indeede store of matters fitter and better a great deale for teachers to spend time and labour in? It is through their importunate and vehement asseuerations, more then through any such experience which we haue had of our owne, that we are forced to thinke it possible for one or other now and then, at leastwise in the prime of the reformation of our Church, to haue stumbled at some kinde of Ceremonies. Wherein for as much as we are contented to take this vpon their credite, and to thinke it may be; sith also they further pretend the same to be so dangerous a snare to their soules, that are at any time taken therein; they must giue our teachers leaue for the sauing of those soules (bee they neuer so fewe) to intermingle sometime with other more necessary thinges, admonition concerning these not vnnecessarie. Wherein they should in reason more easily yeelde this leaue, considering that hereunto we shall not neede to vse the hundreth part of that time, which themselues thinke very needefull to bestowe in making most bitter inuectiues against the ceremonies of the Church.

                  3. that went before her in the worke of reformation. For as the Churches of Christ ought to be most vnlike the synagogue of Antichrist in their indifferent ceremonies; so they ought to be most like one vnto an other, and for preseruation of vnitie to haue as much as possible may be all the same Ceremonies.

               And therefore S. Paul to establish this order in the Church of Corinth, That they should make their gatherings for the poore vpon the first day of the Saboth (which is our sunday) alleageth this for a reason, that he had so ordained in other Churches. Againe, as children of one father and seruants of one family, so all Churches should not only haue one dyet in that they haue one word, but also weare as it were one liuerie in vsing the same Ceremonies. Thirdly, this rule did the great Councell of Nice follow, when it ordained,
               Can. 20. 
               that where certaine at the feast of Pentecoste did pray kneeling,
               The Canon of that Councell which is here cited, doth prouide against kneeling at prayer on Sundayes, or for fiftie dayes after Easter on any day, and not at the feast of Pentecost onely. 
               they should pray standing; the reason whereof is added, which is, that one custome ought to be kept throughout all Churches. It is true that the diuersitie of Ceremonies ought not to cause the Churches to dissent

one with another; but yet it maketh most to thauoyding of dissention, that there be amongst them an vnitie, not onely in doctrine, but also in Ceremonies. And therefore our forme of seruice is to be amended, not onely for that it commeth too neare that of the Papistes, but also because it is so different from that of the reformed Churches.
               T. C. lib. 3. p. 182.183. Beeing asked to what Churches ours should conforme it selfe, and why other reformed Churches should not as well frame themselues to ours; their answere is, That if there be any Ceremonies which wee haue better then others, they ought to frame themselues to vs; if they haue better then we, then we ought to frame our selues to them; if the Ceremonies be alike commodious, the later Churches should conforme themselues to the first,
               Rom. 16.5.7. 
               as the younger daughter to the elder. For as S. Paul in the members, where all other things are equal, noteth it for a marke of honor aboue the rest, that one is called before another to the Gospell;
               1. Cor. 14.37. 
               so is it for the same cause amongest the Churches. And in this respect he pincheth the Corinthes, that not being the first which receiued the Gospell, yet they would haue their seuerall maners from other Churches. Moreouer where the Ceremonies are alike commodious, the fewer ought to conforme themselues vnto the moe. For as much therefore as all the Churches (so farre as they know which pleade after this manner) of our confession in doctrine, agree in the abrogation of diuers things which we reteine; our churches ought either to shew that they haue done euill, or else she is found to be in fault that doth not conforme her selfe in that, which she cannot denie to be well abrogated. In this axiome that preseruation of peace and vnitie amongst Christian Churches should be by al good meanes procured, we ioyne most willingly and gladly with them. Neither denie we but that to th' auoyding of dissention it auaileth much, that there be amongst thē an vnitie as well in ceremonies as in doctrine. The only doubt is about the manner of their vnitie, how far churches are bound to be vniforme in their ceremonies, & what way they ought to take for that purpose. Touching the one, the rule which they haue set down is; that in ceremonies in differēt all churches ought to be one of them vnto another as like as possibly they may be. Whcih possibly we cannot otherwise conster, thē that it doth require them to be euen as like as they may be, without breaking any positiue ordinance of God. For the ceremonies wherof we speake being matter of positiue law; they are indifferent, if God haue neither himselfe cōmanded nor forbidden thē, but left thē vnto the Churches discretion. So that if as great vniformitie bee required as is possible in these things, seeing that the law of God forbiddeth not any one of thē; it followeth, that from the greatest vnto the least they must be in euery Christian Church the same, except meere impossibilitie of so hauing it be the hinderāce. To vs this opinion seemeth ouer extreame & violent: wee rather incline to thinke it a iust and reasonable cause for any Church, the state whereof is free and independent, if in these things it differ from other Churches, only for that it doth not iudge it so fit & expedient to be framed therin by the patterne of their example, as to bee otherwise framed then they. That of Gregorie vnto Leander is a charitable speech and a peaceable; In vnâ fide nil officit Ecclesiae sanctae consuetudo diuersa, Where the faith of the holy Church is one, a difference in customes of the Church doth no harme. That of S. Augustine to Cassulanus is somewhat more particular, and toucheth what kinde of ceremonies they are, wherein one Church may vary from the example of an other without hurt; Let the faith of the whole church how wide so euer it haue spred it selfe be alwaies one, although the vnitie of beliefe be famous for varietie of certain ordinances,

               wherby that which is rightly beleeued suffereth no kind of let or impediment. Caluin goeth further, As concerning rites in particular let the sentence of Augustine

take place, which leaueth it free, vnto all Churches to receiue their owne custome. Yea sometime it profiteth and is expedient that there be difference, least men should thinke that religion is tyed to outward ceremonies. Alwayes prouided that there be not any emulation, nor that churches delighted with noueltie affect to haue that which others haue not. They which graunt it true that the diuersitie of Ceremonies in this kind ought not to cause dissention in churches, must eyther acknowledge that they graunt in effect nothing by these words; or if any thing be granted, there must as much be yeelded vnto, as we affirme against their former strict assertion. For if Churches be vrged by way of dutie to take such ceremonies as they like not of; how can dissention be auoyded? Will they say that there ought to be no dissention, because such as are vrged ought to like of that whereunto they are vrged? If they say this, they say iust nothing. For how should any Church like to be vrged of dutie, by such as haue no authoritie or power ouer it, vnto those things which being indifferent it is not of dutie bound vnto them? Is it their meaning, that there ought to be no dissention, because that which Churches are not bound vnto, no man ought by way of dutie to vrge vpon them; and if any man doe, he standeth in the sight both of God and men most iustly blameable, as a needelesse disturber of the peace of Gods Church, & an author of dissention? In saying this they both condemne their owne practise, when they presse the Church of England with so strict a bond of dutie in these thinges, and they ouerthrowe the ground of their practise, which is that there ought to bee in all kinde of ceremonies vniformitie, vnlesse impossibilitie hinder it. For proofe whereof it is not enough to alleage what S. Paul did about the matter of collections, or what Noble-men doe in the liueries of their seruants, or what the Councell of Nice did for standing in time of prayer on certain daies: because though S.

               ft of God to the iudgement of the Church. And seeing Churches are rather in

this case like diuerse families; then like diuers seruants of one family; because euery Church, the state whereof is independent vpon any other, hath authoritie to appoint orders for it selfe in thinges indifferent; therefore of the two we may rather inferre, that as one familie is not abridged of libertie to be clothed in Fryers gray, for that an other doth weare clay-colour; so neither are all Churches bound to the selfe same indifferent Ceremonies which it liketh sundry to vse. As for that Canon in the Councell of Nice, let them but read it and waigh it well. The auncient vse of the Church throughout all Christendome was, for fiftie dayes after Easter (which fifty dayes were called Pentecost, though most commonly the last day of them which is Whitsunday be so called) in like sort on all the Sundayes throughout the whole yeare their manner was to stand at praier, whereupon their meetinges vnto that purpose on those dayes had the name of Stations giuen them. Of which custome Tertullian speaketh in this wise; It is not with vs thought sit either to fast on the Lordes day, or to pray kneeling. The same immunitie from fasting and kneeling we keepe all the time which is betweene the Feasts of Easter and Pentecost. This being therefore and order generally receiued in the Church; when some began to be singular and different from all others, and that in a ceremonie which was then iudged very conuenient for the whole Church euen by the whole, those fewe excepted which brake out of the common pale: the Councell of Nice thought good to inclose them againe with the rest, by a lawe made in this sort: Because there are certaine which will needs kneele at the time of praier on the Lordes day, and in the fiftie dayes after Easter, the holy Synode iudging it meet that a conuenient custome be obserued throughout all churches, hath decreed that standing wee make our praiers to the Lord. Whereby it plainely appeareth that in things indifferent, what the whole Church doth thinke conuenient for the whole, the same if any part doe wilfully violate, it may be reformed and inrayled againe by that generall authority whereunto ech particular is subiect, and that the spirit of singularitie in a few ought to giue place vnto publike iudgement; this doth clearely enough appeare: but not that all Christian Churches are bound in euery indifferent ceremonie to be vniforme; because where the whole hath not tyed the parts vnto one and the same thing, they being therein left each to their owne choyce, may either do as other do or else otherwise, without any breach of dutie at all. Concerning those indifferent thinges, wherein it hath beene heretofore thought good that all Christian Churches, should bee vniforme, the way which they now conceiue to bring this to passe was then neuer thought on. For till now it hath bene iudged, that seeing the lawe of God doth not prescribe all particular ceremonies which the Church of Christ may vse, and in so great varietie of them as may be found out, it is not possible that the lawe of nature and reason should direct all Churches vnto the same thinges; each deliberating by it selfe what is most conuenient: the way to establish the same things indifferent throughout them all, must needs be the iudgement of some iudiciall authoritie drawne into one onely sentence, which may be a rule for euery particular to follow. And because such authoritie ouer all Churches, is too much to be granted vnto any one mortall man; there yet remaineth that which hath bene alwayes followed, as the best, the safest, the most sincere and reasonable way, namely the verdict of the whole Church orderly taken, and set downe in the assembly

of some generall councell. But to maintaine that all Christian Churches ought for vnities sake to be vniforme in all ceremonies, & then to teach that the way of bringing this to passe must be by mutuall imitation, so that where we haue better ceremonies then others they shall bee bound to followe vs, and we them where theirs are better; how should we thinke it agreeable and consonant vnto reason? For sith in things of this nature there is such varietie of particular inducements, whereby one Church may be led to thinke that better, which another Church led by other inducements iudgeth to be worse: (For example, the East Church did thinke it better to keepe Easter day after the manner of the Iewes, the West Church better to do otherwise; the Greeke Church iudgeth it worse to vse vnleauened bread in the Eucharist, the Latine Church leauened; one Church esteemeth it not so good to receiue the Eucharist sitting as stāding, another Church not so good standing as sitting; there being on the one side probable motiues as well as on the other:) vnlesse they adde somewhat else to define more certainely what ceremonies shall stand for best, in such sort that all Churches in the world shall know them to be the best, and so know them that there may not remaine any question about this point; we are not a whit the neerer for that they haue hitherto said. They themselues although resolued in their owne iudgements what ceremonies are best, the foreseeing that such as they are addicted vnto, be not all so clearely and so incomparably best, but others there are or may be at least wise when all things are well considered as good,T.

                knewe not which way smoothly to rid their hands of this matter, without prouiding some more certaine rule to be followed for establishment of vniformitie in ceremonies, when there are diuerse kinds of equall goodnesse; and therefore in this case they say, that the later Churches & the fewer should conforme themselues vnto the elder and the mo. Hereupon they conclude, that for as much as all the reformed Churches (so farre as they know) which are of our confession in doctrine, haue agreed already in the abrogation of diuerse things which we reteine: our Church ought either to shew that they haue done euill, or else she is found to be in fault for not conforming her selfe to those Churches, in that which she cannot deny to be in them well abrogated. For the authoritie of the first Churches, (and those they accompt to be the first in this cause which were first reformed) they bring the comparison of younger daughters conforming themselues in attire to the example of their elder sisters;Rom. 16.5. wherein there is iust as much strength of reason as in the liuery coates before mentioned. S. Paul they say, noteth it for a marke of speciall honor, that Epaenetus was the first man in all Achaia which did embrace the Christian faith; after the same sort he toucheth it also as a speciall preeminence of Iunias and Andronicus,
               1. Cor. 14.36. that in Christianity they were his auncients; the Corinthians he pincheth with this demaund, Hath the word of God gone out from you, or hath it lighted on you alone? But what of all this▪ If any man should thinke that alacrity & forwardnes in good things doth adde nothing vnto mens commendation; the two former speeches of S. Paule might leade him to reforme his iudgement. In like sort to take downe the stomacke of proud conceited men, that glorie as though they were able to set all others to schoole, there can be nothing more fit then some such words as the Apostles third sentence doth containe; wherein he teacheth the Church of Corinth to know, that there was no such great oddes betweene them and the rest of their

brethren, that they should thinke themselues to be gold and the rest to be but copper. He therefore vseth speech vnto them to this effect: Men instructed in the knowledge of Iesus Christ there both were before you, and are besides you in the word▪ ye neither are the fountaine from which first, nor yet the riuer into which alone the word hath flowed. But although as Epaenetus was the first man in all Achaia, so Corinth had bene the first Church in the whole world that receiued Christ: the Apostle doth not shew that in any kind of things in different whatsoeuer, this should haue made their example a law vnto all others. Indeed the example of sundry Churches for approbation of one thing doth sway much; but yet still as hauing the force of an example onely, and not of a lawe. They are effectuall to moue any Church, vnlesse some greater thing do hinder; but they bind none▪ no not though they be many; sauing onely when they are the maior part of a generall assembly, and then their voyces being moe in number must ouersway their iudgements who are fewer, because in such cases the greater halfe is the whole. But as they stand out single each of them by it selfe, their number can purchase them no such authority, that the rest of the Churches being fewer should be therefore bound to follow them, and to relinquish as good ceremonies as theirs for theirs. Whereas therefore it is concluded out of these so weake premisses,T.C. l. 3. p. 183. Our Church ought either to shew that they haue done euill, or else shee i

                that the reteining of diuerse things in the Church of England, which other reformed Churches haue cast out, must needs argue that we do not well▪ vnlesse we can shewe that they haue done ill; what needed this wrest to draw out from vs an accusation of forraine Churches? It is not proued as yet that if they haue done well, our duty is to followe them, and to forsake our owne course, because it different from theirs, although indeed it be as well for vs euery way, as theirs for them. And if the proofes alleaged for conformation hereof had bene 
                  •
               ound, yet seeing they leade no further then onely to shew, that where we can haue no better ceremonies theirs must be taken; as they cannot with modesty thinke themselues to haue found out absolutely the best which the wit of men may deuise, so liking their owne somewhat better then other mens, euen because they are their owne, they must in equitie allow vs to be like vnto them in this affection; which if they do, they case vs of that vncourteou

And if our owne be but equall, the law of common indulgence alloweth vs to thinke them at the least halfe a thought the better because they are our owne; which we may very well do, and neuer drawe any inditement at all against theirs,A declaration of the proceedings of the Church of England, for establishment of things as they are. but thinke commendably euen of them also.
            14 To leaue reformed Churches therefore & their actions for him to iudge of, in whose sight, they are as they are, and our desire is that they may euen in his sight be found such, as we ought to endeuour by all meanes that our owne may likewise be: somewhat we are inforced to speake by way of simple declaration, concerning the proceedings of the Church of England in these affaires▪ to the end that men whose minds are free from those partiall, cōstructions, wherby the only name of difference frō some other Churches is thought cause sufficient to condēne ours, may the better discerne whether that we haue done be reasonable, yea or no. The Church of Englād being to alter her receiued laws cōcerning such orders, rites and ceremonies, as had bene in former times an hinderance

vnto pietie and Religious seruice of God, was to enter into consideration first, that the change of lawes, especially concerning matter of Religion, must be warily proceeded in. Lawes, as all other things humaine, are many times full of imperfection, and that which is supposed behoofefull vnto men, proueth often-times most pernicious. The wisedome which is learned by tract of time, findeth the lawes that haue bene in former ages establisht, needfull in later to be abrogated. Besides that which sometime is expedient, doth not alwaies so continue: and the number of needlesse lawes vnabolisht, doth weaken the force of them that are necessarie. But true withall it is, that alteration though it be from worse to better hath in it inconueniences and those waighty; vnlesse it be in such laws as haue bene made vpon special occasions, which occasions ceasing, laws of that kind do abrogate themselues. But when we abrogate a law as being ill made, the whole cause for which it was made still remaining; do we not herein reuoke our very owne deed, and vpbraid our selues with folly, yea all that were makers of it with ouer sight and with error? Further if it be a law which the custome & continuall practise of many ages or yeares hath confirmed in the minds of men, to alter it must needs be troublesome and scandalous. It amazeth them, it causeth thē to stand in doubt, whether any thing be in it selfe by nature either good or euil, & not al things rather such as men at this or that time agree to accōpt of them, whē they behold euen those things disproued, disanulled, reiected, which vse had made in a maner naturall. What haue we to induce mē vnto the willing obedience & obseruation of lawes, but the waight of so many mēs iudgement, as haue with deliberate aduise assented thereunto; the waight of that long experience, which the world hath had thereof with consent & good liking? So that to change any such law, must needs with the common sort impaire and weaken the force of those grounds, whereby all lawes are made effectual. Notwithstanding we do not deny alteration of laws to be sometimes a thing necessary; as when they are vnnatural, or impious, or otherwise hurtfull vnto the publique community of mē, and against that good for which humaine societies were instituted. When the Apostles of our Lord & Sauiour were ordained to alter the lawes of Heathnish Religion receiued throughout the whole world; chosen I grant they were (Paule excepted) the rest ignorant, poore, simple, vnschooled altogether and vnlettered men; howbeit extraordinarilie indued with ghostly wisedome from aboue before they euer vndertooke this enterprise, yea their authoritie confirmed by miracle; to the end it might plainely appeare that they were the Lords Ambassadours, vnto whose Soueraigne power for all flesh to stoope, for all the kingdomes of the earth to yeeld themselues willingly conformable in whatsoeuer should be required, it was their duty. In this case therefore their oppositions in maintenance of publique superstition against Apostolique endeuours, as that they might not condemne the wayes of their ancient predecessors, that they must keepe Religiones traditas, the rites which frō age to age had descended, that the ceremonies of Religion had beene euer accompted by so much holier as elder, these and the like allegations in this case were vaine & friuolous. Not to stay longer therefore in speech concerning this point, we will conclude, that as the change of such lawes as haue bene specified is necessary, so the euidence that they are such must be great. If we haue neither voice frō heauen that so pronounceth of them; neither sentence of men grounded vpon such

manifest and cleare proofe, that they in whose hands it is to alter them may likewise infallibly euen in hart & conscience iudge them so; vpon necessitie to vrge alteration is to trouble and disturbe without necessitie. As for arbitrary alterations, when laws in themselues not simply bad or vnmeet are changed for better and more expedient; if the benefit of that which is newly better deuised be but small, sith the custome of easinesse to alter and change is so euill, no doubt but to beare a tolerable soare is better then to venter on a dangerous remedy. Which being generally thought vpon, as a matter that touched neerly their whole enterprise; whereas change was notwithstanding concluded necessary, in regard of the great hurt which the Church did receiue by a number of things then in vse, whereupon a great deale of that which had bene was now to be taken away and remoued out of the Church; yeat sith there are diuerse waies of abrogating things established, they saw it best to cut off presently such things, as might in that sort be extinguished without danger, leauing the rest to be abolished by disusage through tract of time. And as this was done for the manner of abrogation: so touching the stint or measure thereof, rites & ceremonies and other externall things of like nature being hurtfull vnto the Church, either in respect of their quality, or in regard of their nūber; in the former there could be no doubt or difficulty what should be done, their deliberation in the later was more hard. And therefore in as much as they did resolue to remoue only such things of that kind as the Church might best spare, reteining the residue; their whole counsell is in this point vtterly cōdemned, as hauing either proceeded from the blindnes of those times, or from negligence, or from desire of honour and glory, or from an erroneous opinion that such things might be tollerated for a while, or if it did proceed (as they which would seeme most fauourable are content to thinke it possible) from a purpose partly the easilier to draw Papists vnto the Gospell, by keeping so many orders stil the same with theirs,T.C. l. 2. p. 29. It may well be their purpose was by that temper of Popish ceremonies with the Gospell, partly the 
                        •
                     asilier to draw the Papists to the Gospell, &c. partly to redeeme peace thereby.
                
               and partly to redeeme peace therby, the breach wherof they might feare would insue vpon more thorow alteration, or howsoeuer it came to passe; the thing they did is iudged euill. But such is the lot of all that deale in publique affaires whether of Church or cōmonwealth, that which men list to surmise of their doings be it good or ill, they must before hand patiently arme their minds to indure. Wherefore to let go priuate surmises, whereby the thing in it selfe is not made either better or worse; if iust and allowable reasons might leade thē to do as they did, then are these censures al frustrate. Touching ceremonies harmelesse therfore in thēselues, & hurtful onely in respect of number: was it amisse to decree, that those things which were least needfull & newliest come should be the first that were taken away, as in the abrogating of a nū
               ber of saints daies and of other the like customes it appeareth they did, till afterwards the forme of common prayer being perfited, articles of sound Religion and discipline agreed vpon, Catechismes framed for the needfull instruction of youth, Churches purged of things that indeed were burthensome to the people, or to the simple offensiue and scandalous, all was brought at the length vnto that wherein now we stand? Or was it amisse, that hauing this way eased the Church as they thought of superfluitie, they went not on till they had pluckt vp euen those things also, which had taken a great deale stronger and deeper roote; those things which to abrogate without constraint of manifest harme thereby arising, had bene to alter vnnecessarily (in their iudgements) the auncient receiued

custome of the whole Church, the vniuersall practise of the people of God, and those very decrees of our fathers, which were not only set downe by agreement of generall councels, but had accordingly bin put in vre and so continued in vse till that very time present? True it is that neither councels nor customes, be they neuer so ancient and so generall, can let the Church from taking away that thing which is hurtfull to be retained. Where things haue bene instituted, which being conuenient and good at the first, do afterwards in processe of time waxe otherwise; we make no doubt but they may be altered,T. C. l. 3. p. 
                     •
                  0. yea though councels or customes generall haue receiued them. And therfore it is but a needles kind of opposition which they make who thus dispute, If in those things which are not expressed in the Scripture, that is to be obserued of the Church, which is the custome of the people of God and decree of our forefathers; then how can these things at any time be varied, which heretofore haue bene once ordained in such sort? Whereto we say, that things so ordained are to be kept, howbeit not necessarily any longer, then till there grow some vrgent cause to ordaine the contrary. For there is not any positiue law of men, whether it be generall or particular, receiued by formall expresse consent, as in councels; or by secret approbation, as in customes it commeth to passe, but the same may be taken away it occasion serue. Euen as we all know, that many things generally kept heretofore,Aug. epist. 11
                     •
                  
                are now in like sort generally vnkept and abolished euery where. Notwithstanding till such things be abolished, what exception can there be taken against the iudgement of S. Augustine, who saith, that Of things harmelesse whatsoeuer there is, which the whole Church doth obserue throughout the world; to argue for any mans immunitie from obseruing the same, it were a point of most insolent madnes. And surely odious it must needs haue bene for one Christian Church, to abolish that which all had receiued and held for the space of many ages, & that without any detriment vnto Religion so manifest and so great, as might in the eyes of vnpartiall men appeare sufficient to cleare thē from all blame of rash & inconsiderate proceeding, if in feruour of zeale they had remoued such things. Whereas contrariwise so reasonable moderation herein vsed, hath freed vs from being deseruedly subiect vnto that bitter kind of obloquie, wherby as the Church of Rome doth vnder the colour of loue towards those things which be harmelesse, maintaine extremely most hurtfull corruptions; so we peraduenture might be vpbraided, that vnder colour of hatred towards those things that are corrupt, we are on the other side as extreme, euen againts most harmelesse ordinances. And as they are obstinate to retaine that, which no man of any conscience is able wel to defend: so we might be reckoned fierce and violent, to teare away that, which if our owne mouthes did condemne, our consciences would storme and repine thereat. The Romanes hauing banished Tarquinius the proud, and taken a sollemne oath that they neuer would permit any man more to raigne, could not herewith content themselues, or thinke that tyrannie was throughly extinguished, till they had driuen one of their Consuls to depart the Citie, against whom they found not in the world what to obiect, sauing onely that his name was Tarquine, and that the common-wealth could not seeme to haue recouered perfect freedome, as long as a man of so daungerous a name was left remaining. For the Church of England to haue done the like, in casting out of Papall tyranny and superstition; to haue shewed greater willingnes of accepting

the very ceremonies of the Turke Christs professed enemie,T. C. l. 1. p. 131 For indeede it were more safe for vs to conforme our indifferent ceremonies to the Turkes which are farre off, then to the Papists which are so neare.
                then of the most indifferent things which the Church of Rome approueth; to haue left not so much as the names which the Church of Rome doth giue vnto things innocent; to haue eiected whatsoeuer that Church doth make accompt of, be it neuer so harmelesse in it selfe, and of neuer so auncient continuance, without any other crime to charge it with, then onely that it hath bene the hap thereof to be vsed by the Church of Rome; and not to be commanded in the word of God; this kind of proceeding might happily haue pleased some fewe men, who hauing begun such a course themselues, must needs be glad to see their example followed by vs. But the Almightie which giueth wisedome and inspireth with right vnderstanding whō soeuer it pleaseth him, he foreseeing that which mans wit had neuer bene able to reach vnto, namely what tragedies the attempt of so extreme alteration would raise in some parts of the Christian world, did for the endlesse good of his Church (as we cannot chuse but interpret it) vse the bridle of his prouident restraining hand, to stay those eager affections in some, and to settle their resolution vpon a course more calme and moderate; least as in other most ample and heretofore most flourishing dominions it hath since fallen out, so likewise if in ours it had come to passe, that the aduerse part being enraged, and betaking it selfe to such practises as men are commonly wont to embrace, when they behold things brought to desperate extremities, and no hope left to see any other end, then onely the vtter oppression and cleane extinguishment of one side; by this meane Christendome flaming in all parts of greatest importance at once, they all had wanted that comfort of mutuall reliefe, wherby they are now for the time susteined, (and not the least by this our Church which they so much impeach) till mutuall combustious bloudsheads and wastes (because no other inducement will serue) may enforce them through very faintnesse, after the experience of so endlesse miseries, to enter on all sides at the length into some such consultation, as may tend to the best reestablishment of the whole Church of Iesus Christ. To the singular good whereof it cannot but serue as a profitable direction, to teach men what is most likely to proue auaileable, when they shall quietly consider the triall that hath bene thus long had of both kinds of reformation, as well this moderate kind which the Church of England hath taken, as that other more extreme and rigorous which certaine Churches elsewhere haue better liked. In the meane while it may be, that suspence of iudgement and exercise of charity were safer and seemelier for Christian men, then the hote pursute of these controuersies, wherein they that are most feruent to dispute, be not alwayes the most able to determine. But who are on his side and who against him, our Lord in his good time shall reueale. And sith thus farre we haue proceeded in opening the things that haue beene done, let not the principall doers themselues be forgotten. When the ruines of the house of God (that house which cōsisting of religious soules is most immediatly the pretious temple of the holy Ghost) were become not in his sight alone, but in the eyes of the whole world so exceeding great, that very superstition began euen to feele itselfe too farre growne: the first that with vs made way to repaire the decayes thereof by beheading superstition, was King Henry the eight. The sonne and successour of which famous King as we know was Edward the Saint: in whom (for so by the euent wee may gather) it pleased

God righteous and iust to let England see, what a blessing sinne and iniquitie would not suffer it to enioy. Howbeit that which the wise man hath sayde concerning Enoch (whose dayes were though many in respect of ours, yet scarse as three to nine in comparison of theirs with whome hee liued) the same to that admirable child most worthily may be applyed, Though he departed this worlde soone, yet fulfilled he much time. But what ensued? That worke, which the one in such sort had begun, and the other so farre proceeded in, was in short space so ouerthrowne, as if almost it had neuer bene: till such time as that God, whose property is to shew his mercies then greatest when they are neerest to be vtterly despaired of, caused in the depth of discomfort and darknes a most glorious starre to arise, and on her head setled the Crowne, whome him selfe had kept as a lambe from the slaughter of those bloudie times, that the experience of his goodnes in her own deliuerance, might cause her mercifull▪ disposition to take so much the more delight in sauing others, whom the like necessity shold presse. What in this behalfe hath bene done towards nations abroad, the parts of Christendome most afflicted can best testifie. That which especially concerneth our selues in the present matter we treate of, is the state of reformed religion, a thing at her comming to the Crowne euen raised as it were by miracle from the dead, a thing which we so little hoped to see, that euen they which behelde it done, scarcely belieued their own senses at the first beholding. Yet being then brought to passe, thus many years it hath continued, standing by no other worldly meane but that one only hand which erected it, that hand which as no kinde of imminent daunger could cause at the first to withholde it selfe, so neyther haue the practises so many so bloudie following since beene euer able to make wearie. Nor can we say in this case so iustly, that Aaron and Hur the Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill states haue sustained the hand which did lift it selfe to heauen for them; as that heauen it selfe hath by this hand sustained them, no ayde or helpe hauing thereunto bene ministred for performance of the worke of reformation, other then such kind of helpe or ayde as the Angell in the Prophet Zacharie speaketh of, saying, Neither by an armie nor strength, but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hostes. Which grace and fauour of diuine assistance, hauing not in one thing or two shewed it self, nor for some few daies or yeares appeared, but in such sort so long continued, our manifold sinnes & transgressions striuing to the contrarie; what can we lesse thereupon conclude, then that God would at leastwise by tract of time teach the world, that the thing which he blesseth, defendeth, keepeth, so strangely, cannot choose but be of him? Wherefore if any refuse to beleeue vs disputing for the veritie of religion established, let them beleeue God himselfe thus miraculouslie working for it, and wish life euen for euer and euer vnto that glorious and sacred instrument whereby he worketh.

            An Aduertisement to the Reader▪
            
            I Haue for some causes, (gentle Reader) thought it at this time, more fit to let goe these first foure Bookes by themselues, then to stay both them and the rest, til the whole might together be published. Such generalities of the cause in question as here are handled, it will be perhaps not amisse to consider apart, as by way of introduction vnto the bookes that are to follow concerning particulars. In the meane while thine helping hand must be craued, for the amendment of such faultes committed in printing, as (omitting others of lesse moment) I haue set downe.
