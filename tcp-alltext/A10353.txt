            TO THE RIGHT EXCELLENT AND MIGHTIE PRINCE IAMES THE SIXT BY THE GRACE OF GOD KING OF SCOTLAND.
            
               HAVING of late peruſed, examined, & anſwered certain Sermons preached in Edinburgh by one who entitleth him ſelf Miniſter of Chriſts Euangel there: for ſundry cauſes (moſt excellent and gratious Prince) I haue ben induced, of that my ſmale labour, to make a preſent vnto your royal Maieſtie. Firſt, for that the Author of thoſe Sermons publiſhed them vnder the name of your Highnes; it ſeemed to me conueniēt, that the Anſwere alſo ſhould be offered vnto the ſame perſonage: by conference whereof he might be able, better & with indifferēcy to iudge of both. Next, whereas thoſe Sermons conteyne falſe doctrine againſt the ſacraments, againſt the eternal Teſtament of Chriſt ordeyned in his laſt Supper, againſt the peculiar ſacrifice and worſhip of God evermore and vniuerſally practiſed in the Goſpel and new law ſince the firſt preaching thereof by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: and not only this, but alſo they manifeſtly imply the foundation and ground of plain infidelitie, of diſcrediting al the old & new Teſtment; of denying the chief and ſouerain articles of

Chriſtian faith: who can blame me, if where I perceiue ſo great daunger intended, there I ſtudy to repel the ſame: if where poiſon is addreſsed to infect the very hart of religion, and head of the common welth, there I oppoſe a counterpoiſon againſt that infection: if I couet to preſerue ſound that which others endeuour to corrupt, and deſire by right argument of true Theologie to con

hauing ſo many yeres ſuſteyned hard impri ſonment and finally cruel death and martyrdom for profeſsion of that firſt, auncient & Apoſtolike faith, hath thereby left a glorious and immortal preſident to al her aftercōmers, who clayme tēporal right from ſucceſsion of her blud, to make the like or greater accompt of that right which cometh by ſucceſsion to her in faith; for which, ſhe with Heroical fortitude, neglected her blud, her libertie, her crownes, and what ſo euer is most deere to Princes in this world: and for which neglect her name is more honorable before God & his Angels, her memorie more famous among Chriſtians of this age, and ſo wil be to al poſteritie, then if with refuſal of that faith, that is, with refuſal of Chriſt & eternal bliſse, ſhe had gayned as many tēporal crownes & realmes, as they haue liued dayes & howres, who were occaſioners of that ſo ſtraunge & wōderful execution.
            Now if it ſhal pleaſe your Grace to beſtow ſome voyd tyme in overrunning this ſmale booke: I nothing doubt, but touching the argumēt here intreated that is touching the external ſeruice & honour done to God by ſacrifice and ſacrament in his church, your Grace ſhal eaſely ſee the manifeſt & cleere euidece of our Catholike cauſe: the truth thereof ſet downe in the moſt plain ſcriptures of God: the cōtinuāce thereof teſtified by vniforme conſent of al Antiquitie: the firſt original & roote of the cōtrarie hereſie which now beareth greateſt ſway in your realme of Scotlād as alſo in England; from what fountaine it ſprang, by what Apoſtles it was ſpread; by what Sophiſtrie, malice & diſsimulatiō it hath encreaſed, by what wickednes,

ignorāce, & impietie, it is maynteyned: finally, to what plain Atheiſme or Paganiſme it tēdeth. For which cauſe, many potent kings & princes, although otherwiſe circumuented by falſe miniſters, or ſeduced by evil counſailers, vpon ſome humane reaſons & colourable cōmodities craftely obiected, they departed from the vnitie of Chriſts church, & intangled them ſelues with other hereſies of this tyme: yet could they never be induced to approue, or ſo much as to permit within their realmes this Zuingliā or Calviniā hereſie, becauſe they were thoroughly reſolved, that it was the very bane & pest of wel ordered cōmon welthes; for that it breadeth in her Sectaries a licentious libertie to beleeve what they fiſt againſt God & his church and to live how they pleaſe againſt the magiſtrate & his civil lawes, to which it preacheth that no obedience is due for conſcience ſake. Among which Princes, for exāples ſake to name one (leſt I ſeeme to charge thē vniuſtly) Chriſtianus 3. king of Denmarke, a Prince of great wiſdom and experience, grand-father to that vertuous Princeſse whom your Highnes hath choſen for your ſpouſe and Queene, when as the congrègatiō of ſuch kind of Proteſtants expelled from England byANNO 1553.

Which iudgemēt of that king, their notorious ſauage, and barbarous behauiour in many countries of Europe, hath ſince that time continually more and more verified, and the writings of the miniſters for defenſe of their opinions, which daily they invent, hath much more abundantly iuſtified: whereof this ſmale booke geveth alſo ſome proofe & demōſtration.

            A NOTE FOR THE READER.
            
               
                  WHEREAS M. Bruces Sermōs are printed without any figures diſtinguiſhing ether page or leafe, which no booke lightly omitteth: I haue (good reader) for plain dealing, & the more eaſy notifying to others that which I cite out of him, added figures to ech page, beginning the firſt, next after the Epiſtle dedicatorie, & ſo cōtinuing on by pages, 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. vntil the end of his booke, which is page 296. Thus much I thought good to warne thee of, that if thow pleaſe to ſee his words in his owne booke, thow maiſt with ſo much the more facilitie find them.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
               THE CATHOLIKE AND APOSTOLIKE FAITH CONCERNING THE SACRAMENT.
               
                  The Argument.
                  
                      
                     Chriſt at his last ſupper inſtituted both a Sacrament, & alſo a ſacrifice, conſisting in the true & real preſence of his pretious body & blud.
                  
                  
                      
                     This is proued partly by graunt of the aduerſaries, who confeſſe Chriſt in that ſupper to haue made his new teſtament, partly by particular examining the nature of a teſtament, and conferring the new teſtament with the old.
                  
                  
                      
                     The ſame is proued by the Paſchal lamb, which was a figure (as the aduerſaries alſo graunt) of Chriſts Sacrament & finiſhed in the ſame, & therefore this must needs be a ſacrifice as that was: according to the plaine ſcriptures, & al auncient fathers.
                  
                  
                      
                     The ſame is moſt clearly proued by the ſacrifice of Melchiſedech, which albeit most Proteſtants reiect, & withall reiect the whole primitiue Church of Chriſtians, as alſo the auncient ſynagogue of the lewes, both which church & ſ

                     The ſame faith was reterned & practiſed by the firſt primitiue church in the time of the Apoſtles.
                  
                  
                      
                     The ſame faith was continued in all Chriſtendom from t

                     Councels, & ſtories of the church.
                  
                  
                      
                     Berengarius the firſt notorious father of the ſacramētarie hereſie, conuinced by learning, & condemned in ſundrie Councels gathered out of al Chriſtendom, abiured his owne wicked invention & died penitent therefore: from whoſe time to this age the Catholike faith hath bene clearly acknowledged and mainteyned by al Chriſtians both in the Latin Church, & alſo in the Greeke.
                  
                  
                      
                     Berengarius when he was a ſacramentarie, he was alſo a damnable heretike, euen by the Proteſtants iudgement, for ſundry other hereſies beſides this.
                  
                  
                      
                     So were all they which ſince Berengarius haue taught this hereſie; as Peter de Bruis the Albigenſes, Almaricus and

                     Out of the premiſſe; is gathered a generall & ſure rule & the ſame confirmed by manifeſt ſcriptures, to know an hereſie, & to proue, that Berengarius his opinion (& al that folow him) is heretical. And the ſumme of this chapiter touching the principal contents thereof is concluded with the authoritie of Eraſmus, a man much extolled by the aduerſaries.
                  
               
               THE FIRST CHAPITER.
               
                  BEFORE I come to examine the particular points of error & falſe doctrine contayned in theſe ſermons, I thinke it convenient firſt in a chapter or two to declare the true Catholike faith concerning this ſacrament as it hath alwaies bene receaued and acknowledged in the church of Chriſt; and withal hiſtorically to note, when, an in what ſort the Zuinglian hereſie, that I

                   ¶ Our ſauiour Chriſt therefore, when at the tyme of his paſſion he was to finiſh & conſummate the worke, for which he was incarnate, that is, to redeeme mankynd, abrogate the old law, begin the new, & into this to transfer the ſacrifices and prieſthod of that former, as theHeb. 7.

The old testament conſisted in the tropical & figuratiue blud of beasts, the truth whereof was to be fulfilled in the blud of Christ. The new testament conſisted not in the blud of any beaſt, but of Chriſt the true & immaculate lamb. For declaration whereof he ſaid▪ This cup is the new teſtament in my blud: (or) This cup is my blud, which is of the new teſtament.
                  Christs blud deliuered in his last ſupper. Thus much being manifeſt, confeſſed, and graunted; it muſt alſo be graunted of neceſſitie, that this blud was delyuered in the ſupper, & not only ſhed on the croſſe, as Muſculus & the Zuinglians ſuppoſe. Firſt, becauſe our Sauiour Chriſt according to the report of al the Euangeliſts in preciſe termes ſo avoucheth, This (in the cup or chalice) is my blud of the new testament.

For the preſent, the only authoritie of Gregorious Nyſſenus brother to S. Baſil the great may ſerue, vvho vvriteth very plainly, that our Sauiour after a ſecret and moſt diuine maner of ſacrifice preuented the iudgement and violence of the Iewes, and offered him ſelfe for vs, being at one tyme the prieſt, and the lamb, that taketh away the ſinnes of the world. And when was this done? then when he gaue his body to be eaten, and blud to be drunken of his frends (the Apoſtles.) For a man could not eate the lamb, except the immolation went before. Quum igitur diſcipulis ſuis dedit corpus ad comedendum, aperte demonſtrat iam perfectam & abſolutam eſſe agni immolationem. Chriſt therefore who gaue to his Diſciples his body to be eaten, euidently declareth, that the oblation or immolation of that lamb was now paſt and performed.

Paule, Corpus quod pro vobis frangitur, The body, which is broken for yow, writethChriſts body geuen as in Sacrifies. thus: This is not lightly to be paſſed ouer. For Christ geueth vs not his body ſleightly, or without any condition adioyned, but he geueth it as ſacrificed for vs. VVhere ore the first part of this ſentence declareth that the body of Chriſt is deliuered or exhibited to vs: the ſecond part expreſſeth what fruit cometh to vs thereby, to wit, that thereby we are made partakers of the redemption wrought by Christ, & the benefit of his ſacrificess applied to vs. VVhich words how ſoeuer he vnderſtand them, ſignifie wel & truly, that Chriſt in that his laſt ſupper, deliuered his bleſſed body to his diſciples, & in them to al Chriſtians, not as borne of the virgin, not as converſant in this world, not as riſen from

death, & aſcending to heauen, or ſitting there on gods right hand; but as offered to god, & ſacrificed for vs, & to the end, that by that cōmemoratiue ſacrifice, the fruite of Chriſts redemption procured vniuerſally to al mankind by his death on the croſſe, might be really & effectually applied to al faithfull Chriſtians, members of Chriſts catholike church who haue cōmunication in that ſacrifice.
               ¶ And thus with this opinion, was this ſacrament practiſed by the Apoſtles in the firſt Apoſtolical church immediatly after Chriſt, as we learne by S. Luke, & the Apoſtle S.

Paul proveth the ſacuſes. when as writing to the chriſtians of Corinth, he dehorteth them from cōmunicating with the Gentiles in their idolatrous ſacrifices by an argument taken from the nature of al ſacrifices, & the excellencie of this Chriſtian ſacrifice. For the nature of al ſacrifices is to ioyne the cōmunicants with him vnto whom the ſacrifice is

offered, whether it be god or the deuil. As among the
                        Ibi. v. 18. v. 20. v. 16. v. 21. Iewes (ſaith the Apoſtle) they which did eate of the thing ſacrificed, were thereby made partakers of the ſacrifice, & by ſuch ſacrifice did concrre to the honor of the true god: in like ſort, they which take part of things ofſered to Idols, thereby are made partakers of the Idolatrous ſacrifice, & ſo together with idolaters honor the deuil. Then how ſtraunge a thing is it, that yow who partake of the table & ſacrifice of Chriſt, who there cō
                     municate & receiue his pretious body and blud (for the chalice there bleſſed, is the cōmunication of his blud, the bread there broken is the participation of his body) ſhould alſo be partakers of the table & ſacrifice of deuils. In which argument, albeit the Apoſtle being brief, and writing to Chriſtians, whom he accounteth ſkilful &v. 15. wei inſtructed in this thing, by mentioning litle, ſignifieth more, & ſetting downe one part, willeth them to vnderſtand the whole, as Calvin alſo truly noteth, and

                     •
                   ſo here the very drift of his reaſon, & exact correſpondence of ech part to other, require that as the Iewes had an altar & a ſacrifice, ſo had the Gentils, ſo had the Chriſtians. As the Iewes offered to their god, ſo did the Gentils to their (falſe) god, ſo did the Chriſtians. As the Iewes by that ſeruice were partakersSacrifice vſed among the firſt Chriſtians. of the worſhip of the true god, ſo were the Gentils by the like ſeruice concluded & conuinced to worſhip a falſe god, that is the deuil, & therefore could not haue any part or cōmunion in the worſhip of the true god▪ which was performed by the dreadful ſacritice of Chriſts body & blud among Chriſtians.

               OF BERENGARIVS HERESIE RENEVVED IN THIS AGE.
               
                  The Argument.
                  
                      
                     Luther is to be accompted in ſome ſort, the very original, ground, and cauſe of the Berengarian hereſie renewed in our time.
                  
                  
                      
                     But more preciſely & directly Caroloſtadius, a wicked man and very familiar with the devil, and altogether poſseſsed of him.
                  
                  
                      
                     To whom ſucceded Zuinglius, and after him Oecolampadi agreing with Caroloſtadius in ſubſtance of denying Christs preſence, but differing in particular interpretation of Chriſts words touching the inſtitution of the ſacrament.
                  
                  
                      
                     Diuers other interpretations of Chriſts words one againſt an other: al which are iuſtified by Zuinglius, for that they al concurre to remoue from the ſacrament the real preſence, and eſtabliſh in ſteed thereof a mere priuatiue abſence.
                  
                  
                      
                     As the auncient fathers both Greeke and Latine in the primitiue church, attribute the real preſence of Chriſt in the ſacrament, to the vertue & force of Chriſts words vſed in the conſecration: ſo the Sacramentaries by a contrarie opiniō account ſuch conſecration magical, and therefore remoue the words of Chriſt, teaching their Sacrament to be made as wel without them, as with them.
                  
                  
                      
                     Examples of the ſacramentarie Communion practiſed without the words of Chriſt by the Proteſtants of England Scotland, Zuizzerland, and els where which they both by their practiſe & writing iuſtifie as a very ful and perfite communion.
                  
                  
                      
                     The reſolution of the church of Geneua, that the ſupper may be miniſtred in any kind of meate & drinke, as wel as in bread
                     
                     and wyne. VVhereof is inferred (& that according to the Proteſtant doctrine) that 2. or 3. Euangelical goſsips meeting together to refreſh them ſelues, & eating ſuch vitails as they bring with them, haue as true & perfite a Communion, as the Sacramentaries haue any, both touching matter, & forme, & alſo a lawful Miniſter: which miniſterie or priesthod, euen to preach & miniſter their ſacraments, the Proteſtant-goſpel alloweth to wemen no leſse then to men.

For the text of the goſpel is to cleare & forcible; which can not eaſely be ſhaken, much leſse ouerthrowen by words & gloſes deuiſed by giddy braynes. Thus Luther: after he had by ſundry vvritings and perſvvaſions, vvhere he bare any ſvvay, taken avvay the ſacrifice: ſhevving him ſelfs as forvvard

               VVhich concluſion and confeſſion of Luther, albeit to mer of reaſon & conſcience it ſhould more haue confirmed & eſtabliſhed the truth of Chriſts real preſence in the ſacrament, ſeing Chriſts vvords vvere ſo ſtrong and mightie, that they compelled & enforced as it vvere againſt his vvil, this mortal enemy of Chriſts church to graunt that, vvhich othervviſe he moſt gladly vvold haue denyed: yet in that loſe and diſſolute time, vvhen euerie man by Luthers example tooke libertie to deuiſe vpon the ſcripture as Luther had done; theſe very vvords of Luther gaue great occaſion to his felovves and compartners to inuent ſome farther & ſovvler ſhiftes, & to put that in practiſe, vvhich Luther vvold ful fayne, but hauing as then ſome remorſe of conſcience & regard to Chriſts vvords, durſt not.
               
                   ¶ For vvhich cauſe, Caroloſtadius a companion then of Luther, & Archdeacon of VVittemberg (of vvhich citieCarcloſtad. father of the Caluiniſts. Luther calleth him ſelf preacher & Euangeliſt) folovving Luthers example of framing the ſenſe of ſcripture after his ovvne priuate ſpirite: and conſidering better Luthers ground & rule of interpretation (vvhich vvas ſo to interprete, as he might moſt endamage the Papacie & church Catholike) vvent a litle farther, and deuiſed a vvay, hovv to defeate thoſe vvords vttered by our Sauiour, vvhich ſo hampered & entangled Luther, that he could no vvay rid him ſelf from the power & manifeſt clearnes of them.Caroloſtad. interpretation of Chriſts vvords His way vvas, not to expound them of the ſacrament vvhich Chriſt deliuered to his Apoſtles but of his viſible perſon ſitting at the table, as though Chriſt had ſaid, Eate and drinke, for I am he, that muſt dye for yow al, & this my body is it, which muſt ſuffer on the croſse for your redemption. And this iuterpretation Caroloſtadius inſtified by diuers

A ſecond vvas, that Chriſt here vſed a ſodayne Apoſtrophe,

VVhere the firſt rocke (after the Proteſtants iudgement) is ſpoken of Peter, the ſecond is ſodainly turned avvay from Peter toOne lye built vpon an other. The rock in both places hath one relation to Peter. Chriſts perſon. His third reaſon more probable then al the other vvas, for that whereas Chriſt toke bread in to his hands, and before had ſpoken of the bread in the maſculin gendre,

For vvhich cauſe he calleth him a deuil incarnate, diabolum incorporatū, and vſually, vvriting againſt him, ſo frameth his vvords and vvriting, as though he dealt vvith a deuil, in the forme of a man: That I cal him Deuil (ſaithEgo ad illum non respicio, ſed ad cum▪ a quo obſeus eſt qui per ipſum etiam loquitur Luther) let no man marueil thereat.

To be ſhort, three dayes before his death, the ſame deuil came to him in forme of a man, cited him to appeare, & in fine tooke him avvay out of the vvorld, as vvitneſſeth the ſorenamed Lraſmus Alberus, and other ProteſtantAlber. vbi ſupra, ſ. 1. pa. 1.

For he being a vovved prieſt, firſt of al, euen before Luther, ioyned him ſelf in pretended vvedlocke to a ſiſter, and vvithal vvith helpe of his familiar, deuiſed that interpretation of Chriſts vvords, vvhich before is noted. After vvhom came diuers others, vvho though differing from him in particular circumſtance and maner of expounding that ſhort text, yet al buylt vpon his foundation, and thereof raiſed one & the ſelf ſame concluſion, that the ſacrament vvas only a ſigne, & Chriſts true body & blud remoued as far from it, as the higheſt heauē is from the lovveſt earth, as Beza ſpake in the aſſembly of Poiſſye, & is commonly found in al the ſacramentarie vvriters.

For in this, there is no colour of truth.

                  for vow, by the word (body) he vnderſtandeth his death & paſsion. How beit in an other treatiſe of the ſupper, he ſaith, the bread and fleſh-which Chriſt here mentioneth, is nothing els but faith. And yet in an other booke he is of an other iudgement,
                  2

Thus VVeſtphalus: and much more to this purpoſe may the learned reader ſee in the ſame place. Yet one other interpretation Zuinglius geueth of this vvord (body) vvhich VVeſtphalus mentioneth not, vz. that the body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt ſignifieth the6 church. His vvords are: VVhen as Paule 1. Cor. 10. ſaith,
                  Zuingl. Tom. 2. ad Matth. Rutling. fol. 157. 
                  that the bread which we receiue, is the cōmunication of Chriſts body: here it ſtandeth for the cōmunication of the church: for that by this meanes euery man approueth him ſelf to the church and ingraffeth him ſelf therein as it were by geuing an othe. The ſame expoſition he auoucheth in his Commentarie

This action ſignifieth a figure & ſigne of the church, of Christs paſsion or, Deitie, & ſo forth. Al vvhich dravveth to this point; firſt, that from the ſacrament, Chriſts body is quit remoued, and no maner of Chriſts preſence leaſt there at al, more then in any other common action, place, or aſſembly of Chriſtians. Next, that concerning any vvorke, effect, vertue or operation vvrought in the elements of bread and vvine by force of Chriſts vvords, there is nothing done at al. Only in the mynd and vnderſtanding of the còmunicants, if they be vvel inſtructed, ſomvvhat there may be perhaps. For they cōming to receiue, ſome perchance remember Chriſt, other geue thanks for his death, other thinke vpon his Deitie, other vpon the church his myſtical body, and ſo

But I thinke if men wil looke vpon S. Paules words wel, they ſhal be forced to ſay as S. Paule ſaith, The Lord IESVS ſaid it, & once for al, which only was the fulfiller of it. For theſe words▪ HOC

By which diſcourſe it appeareth that they acknowledge, firſt, the words of Chriſts ſupper to be ſpoken of Chriſts natural preſence and body, which they ſay is ſo playne, that no man is able to deny it. Next, that this ſo apperteyneth to Chriſt alone, that he only, and no man euer after him could miniſter this ſupper.

to agree in part with Caroloſtadius, in that it denyeth the words ſpoken by Chriſt at his laſt ſupper, to perteyne to our Euchariſt. But it agreeth much more with the ſanſie of Petrus de Bruis author of the ſect of the Albigenſes.

And to ſpeake (in publike aſsembly) beſides the ſpirite, there is required a good voyce, eloquence, memorie, & other natural gifts, which who ſo wanteth, he muſt yeld his right to an other. So Paule forbiddeth wemen to ſpeake, not altogether, but in the church, that is to ſay, where are men able to ſpeake; & that for order & honeſties ſake. For a man is more fit then a woman, and the ſpirite doth more inſpire men then women: & this is the meaning of Paules place. Otherwiſe how ſhould Paule alone withſtand the holy ghoſt, who ſaith Ioel 2. your daughters ſhal prophecie: and Act. 21. Philip had 4. daughters that prophecied. Out of al vvhich & much more to like effect, he draweth this concluſion. Order therefore & honeſtie requireth, that men ſpeaking, wemen ſhould hold their peace. But where men ſpeake not, there it is neceſſarie, that wemen ſpeake. By al which we ſee, that the word of god forbiddeth not wemen to prophecie (that is in the new goſpel to preach, no not amongſt men, much leſſe amongſt wemen) which is the higheſt office, & conſequently nether to miniſter the communion & baptiſme, which is a great deale leſſe, if ſo be that they haue better learning & vtterance then men haue, as oft tymes it chaunceth: or if the miniſter through negligence and ignorance be not able to preach the word, which perhaps in Scotland & England is very common.

Paule in forbidding wemen to preach, then in forbidding them to vncouer their heads? And yet yow know in the beſt reformed churches of al Germanie, al the maydes be barehedded, which the preachers & learned men make no great accompt of. As much to ſay, that it is a thing indifferent for wemen to preach & miniſter the Sacraments, & may wel be ſuffered, no leſſe then it is that maydes go with their heads vncouered, which S.

               OF CALVIN AND THE CALVINISTS OPINION CONCERNING THE SACRAMENT.
               
                  The Argument.
                  
                      
                     Caluins high ſpeaches & amplifications of his ſupper. VVherein is ſhewed by a number of plaine teſtimonies, that he acknowlegeth (at the leſt, as his manifest words import) a true and real preſence of Chriſt; body and blud in the Sacrament, in as plaine and cleare maner as any Lutheran.
                  
                  
                      
                     Caluin notwithſtanding ſuch high and counterfait ſpeaches, which he of purpoſe affecteth to deceiue his reader, yet ſtil thinketh of the Sacrament as a mere Zuinglian: and by 5. diuers crafty ſpecial degrees, beſides a ſixt more general, againſt the words and ſentences before cited, induceth his Sacramentarie hereſie. The firſt is, that he denieth to the ſupper Christs body and blud, & in ſteed thereof putteth ſome real vertue deriued from his body and blud by the holy ghoſt, which ſerueth as a canduit-pipe to that effect: wherein he many wayes contradicteth him ſelf.
                  
                  
                      
                     The next degree is, that he denieth (as al old Sacramentaries commonly do) euen this deriuation of any ſuch vertue, & alloweth no other communion of Chriſts body to the ſupper, then is had out of the ſupper by only beleeuing. In which ſort Chriſts fleſh and blud is receiued as wel or better in hearing a ſermon, then in receiuing the ſupper. Only there is in the ſupper ioyned to ſuch receiuing an external ſigne of bread and drinke.
                  
                  
                      
                     A third degree is, that Caluin and the Caluiniſts teach, not only that Chriſts body and blud is better receiued cut of the ſupper then in the ſupper, better by a ſermon or reading the
                     
                     ſcripture then by their Sacramental bread and wine, but alſo acknowlege no maner communication of Chriſts body ether real or ſpiritual as proper to the ſupper. VVhereof becauſe it would f
                           •
                        low, that their ſupper were altogether ſuperfluous, they vſed a new point of doctrine, that the Sacramental bread and wine ſerued for ſeales, & teſtimonies, or ratifications of Chriſts body and blud receiued before by the meanes of faith.
                  
                  
                      
                     For that the doctrine of ſeales is daungerous, & in deed very falſe, Caluin and the reſt proceed on: and that their ſupper be not altogether friuolous, he ſaith it is ordeyned for to helpe weake memories. And this is the true concluſion of the Sacramentarie doctrine generally, to make no more of the Sacrament then a mere rude picture or ſigne of Chriſts body and blud abſent, voyd of al grace and vertue.
                  
                  
                      
                     Beſides the former points, Caluin & the Caluiniſts the more to diſgrace the Sacraments of baptiſme & the ſupper, cōpare them and make them no better then the Iewiſh ceremonies. VVhich doctrine beſides that it is moſt directly oppoſite to Caluins firſt preaching, wherein

                         directly oppoſite to the whole courſe of the new teſtament, which euery where denyeth al grace to the Sacraments of Moyſes law, and attributeth al grace to the Sacraments of Chriſt: goſpel: and the contrarie doctrine vnworthely confoundeth the goſpel of Chriſt with the law of Moyſes.
                  
                  
                      
                     The Caluinian cōmunion is particularly conferred with a like ceremonie vſed of old among the Iewes: and againſt Caluin and Beza it is by plaine demonſtration out of their owne doctrine and writings proued, that their ſupper is nothing better then a mere graceles Iewiſh ſupper or ceremonie.

                     farther declared, that the Sacrament after Caluins doctrine is much inferior to the like Sacrament (ether the Paſchal ſupper, and eſpecially Manna) of the Iewes. VVhich thing is ſhewed by manifeſt reaſon and particular conference of thoſe Sacraments together cut of the writing and teaching of the Caluiniſts: which alſo proue both their Sacraments (baptiſme and the ſupper) to apperteyne rather to the law of Moyſes, then to the goſpel of Chriſt.

                  AGainſt the premiſſes it wil be replyed (I ſuppoſe) that how ſo euer I, ether vpon pretence of Luthers authoritie, or of myne owne conceite, diſgrace and abaſe the Zuinglian cōmunion; yet it is wel knowen, that their writers and Doctors much amplifie & advaunce the worthines thereof: as in ſundry their bookes, Apologies, and Commentaries is manifeſt. VVhere vnto I anſwere: that true it is, ſome ſuch places in ſome of their writers are ſound; but in ſuch ſort as litle cōmendeth their cōmunions. For as rebels, when they haue withdrawen them ſelues from their lawfulHovv the Sacramentanes ſome times magnifie their Sacrament. king appointed them by gods ordinance, and framed to them ſelues one of their owne crue; in the beginning, or ſo long as he pleaſe them, they much extolle & magnifie him; but vpon the firſt diſpleaſure and diſcontentment, he is pulled downe againe, and brought to his old roome, or perhaps ſerued a worſe turne: and as tyrannes vpon the ſodayne advaunce their minions & favorites, heaping on them al riches and honors; whom afterwards vpon better conſideration of their ſmale deſerts, or ſome other light occaſion they deſpoyle, abaſe, deſpiſe, and perhaps hang out of the way: in like ſort theſe goſpellers hauing reiected the Sacrament which Chriſt ordeyned, and in place of it invented a toy of their owne: for ſome tyme and in ſome place againſt their adverſaries; or for ſome other occaſion, much praiſe

and magnifie it. But after when the heate is paſt, and they by learning come to examine it, or by other force of truth are driuen therevnto, or without contention ſpeake of it as it is, and as they thinke; then are they conſtrayned to put away al thoſe former borowed fethers, and leaue it as pild, as Aeſopes daw: that is, they are then driuen to confeſle it to be as poore and beggerly a bitte of bread and ſuppe of drinke, as any vſed at common tables. And this the reader ſhal find not only in the old Sacramentaries, but alſo in the new.

For vvhat plain & rural Caluiniſt can not comprehend this? But the manifold & manifeſt contradictions of Caluin to him ſelfe in this article vvil yet appeare more ſenſibly if vve continue to declare, by vvhat other degrees he falleth from his firſt high and diuine deſcription of Chriſts real preſence in the ſupper, to a plain Zuinglian and Caroloſtadian abſence from the ſaine.

In beleeuing that Chriſt is dead for our redemptiō, & is riſen for our iuſtificatiō, our ſowle eateth the body of Chriſt ſpiritually. VVhich being ſo, this maner of eating geueth no title of preeminence, nor maketh any kind of difference betwene the ſupper, and any other time, place, or action, when ſo euer we beleeue in like ſort. Nether if al the eating conſiſt in beleeuing that Chriſt is dead for our redemption, & riſen for our iuſtification, is there any more vertue, force or quickening power (as Caluin ſpeaketh) deriued to vs from Chriſts fleſh, when we eate the Proteſtant ſupper, then when we eate our owne dinner, in caſe we beleeue Chriſt to be our redeemer & iuſtifier, whichChriſt no other vviſe receiued in the proteſtant ſupper, then out of it. is the whole & only way to eate Chriſt, and then which there can be no other imagined. The Proteſtant at this ſupper hath perhaps a draught of wine & a bit of bread more then the ſtander by, or then we at our dynner, but our faith being as good as his, we ſpiritually and effectually and (touching al deriuation of vertue from his fleſh) as profitably eate Chriſt▪ if ſo be at leaſt we beleeue his death & reſurrection as fully and ſufficiently as doth the Proteſtant, which is eaſie to do. VVherefore let this ſtand for a ſecond degree of retracting his firſt iudgement, that here not only the true and real preſence of the body and blud, but alſo al true and real deriuation or participation of any vertue or force to be obteyned in the ſupper, is vtterly remoued: for ſo much as the ſupper conteyneth nothing ſingular aboue vſual Chriſtian beleefe: and then doubtles no more real vertue is traduced from Chriſts fleſh vnto vs ſupping, then to a child ſaying his beleefe, to a preacher preaching a good ſermon, or his audience attending him: to a rich man geving his almes, or a poore man ſaying his Pater noſter, or (if that phraſe be better liked) the Lords prayer.

                  when matters haue bene by words of frendſhip & agreement before concluded & arreſted on, then is the contract ratified & confirmed by ſhaking of hands: without which antecedent words of concord, the ſhaking of hands is nothing, which may as wel be done by an enemie to euil purpoſe, as by a frend to good: euen ſo fareth it in the ſacraments of baptiſme and the ſupper, which are ſeales to ratifie & cōfirme ſpiritual things, but not to geue or confer them, as hath bene ſaid before.

                   (where in he groſſely belieth the auncient fathers, as alſo al other Catholiks) but this is an error vtterly to be reiected of al faythful. For it fighteth directly with the doctrine of iuſtifying faith which is ſo neceſſarily required, is that without it, the ſacramēts are not only vnprofitable to the receiuers, but alſo hurtful. For ſacraments as they are ſignes of grace, ſo they ſignifie grace (& geue none) as wel in the new teſtament as the old. As they are ſeales of iuſtice of fayth, ſo ſeale they and confirme it not only in the new teſtament, but alſo in the old: and they confirme it, not as the ſpirite ſealeth, but as ſignes do ſeale. As they are figures, ſo by the external ſhape & ſimilitude they figure and repreſent the things ſignified, as in the old teſtament▪ ſo in they new. In that they are memorials, ſo in the mynds of the faithful renew they the benefites of heauenly grace, no leſſe in the old teſtamēt, then in the new. If beſides this we attribute any force to our ſacraments, that they worke grace, iuſtice, health in thoſe that vſe them, we geue to them that which only is the

Thus reſting vpon the ſignification common to both ſacraments of the old: lavv and the nevv, and remouing al grace and vertue (as do the Caluiniſts) proper to the new aboue the old, moſt cleare and ſenſibly apparant it is, that amongſt other, that ſacrament of the old lavv far ſurpaſſed this of the nevv, becauſe (as P. Martyr vvriteth) that ſacrament had ſuch a number of properties, by which it did very aptly deſigne to vs and repreſent the thing ſignified, that is Chriſt IESVS (by vvhich ſignification theſe men define their ſacraments) vvhereof this Caluinian ſacrament hath ſcarce any one: and for very many of theſe properties, it rather conteyneth a contrarie and falſe ſignification, and conſequently leadeth the cōmunicants to a vvrong, falſe, and vvicked opinion of Chriſt the thing ſignified.

                      Although no ſacrament of the new teſtament be euer called a ſeale in the ſcripture; yet vpon that word once attributed peculiarly to circumciſion in Abraham, the Caluiniſts frame their definition of a ſacramēt, that it is a ſeale to confirme gods promiſes. VVhich definition is improued by manifeſt demonſtration, that the ſacraments haue no ſuch office to confirme

                  I am ſure (ſaith he) none of theſe great ſtormes, & tragedies, and debates had fallen out. Out of al which, he draweth a very ſo ber inſtruction: A leſſon by the way (ſaith M. B.) Let no fleſh preſume to be wiſer then god: but let them ſtoupe, and keep
                  
                  the names which god hath geuen to this ſacrament. In which vvords & diſcourſe, to omit ſome other things very wel worth the noting, a leſſon the reader may learne much better then that vvhich M. B. geueth him: that is, our aduerſaries great frowardnes and blindnes in their maner of vvriting, diſputing & preaching. The which becauſe it is by M. B. made the very ground and foundation of his Sermons: and is common to him with the reſt of his felovves and comminiſters both in Scotland and out of Scotlād, I wil open ſomwhat more at large. The word ſacrament (ſaith M. B.) is not vſed in the ſcripture: it is inuēted not by the holy ghoſt, but by the wit of man, which is mere folly: it hath bene and is the cauſe of much ſtrife, contention and digladiation; of great ſtormes, tragedie; & debates, which yet continue. The ſcripture appointeth other names, as ſignes or ſeales. Hereof this Euangelical leſſon is to be learned, Let no fleſh preſume to be wiſer then god: but let them ſtoupe, and keep the names, which god hath geuen to this ſacrament.
                  M. B. notably contradicteth him ſelf. and yet forſooth both him ſelf in theſe ſelf ſame Sermons, continually euery where: and al other the principal vvriters of his ſide, omitting the names of ſignes & ſeales geuen by god; forgetting their owne leſſō 
                  that al fleſh ſhould ſtoupe, and vſe ſuch names of ſignes and ſeales as god had geven, in ſteed thereof wil needs vſe the name of ſacrament, inuēted by the wit of man which is mere folly (and then they not very vviſe that vſe it) & by ſo doing, maynteine this contention and digladiation, theſe great ſtormes, tragedies and debates, which is the part of vvicked men and miniſters of ſedition. If god geue yovv varietie & choyſe of other ſo apt names, ſo good & profitable, whereas this is ſo harmeful and miſchevous; vvhy refuſe yovv god and folovv man? VVhy in euery leafe of theſe your Sermons, is there ſet forth in great capital letters this vvicked word Sacramēt, inuented by man, & not rather the vvord Signe or Seale appoynted by god? As yovv haue altered the Maſſe in to the Communion, Biſſhop in to ſuperintendent, prieſt in to miniſter, church in to congregation &c. ſo why in like maner chaunge yovv

Ioachimus VVeſtphalus the Lutheran, in his laſt anſvvere to Caluin vvriteth, that Caroloſtadius (the firſt father of the ſacramentaries in ourVVeſtphalus in Apologie▪ pa. 5. daies) in his diſputations and bookes of the ſupper of the lord, vtterly reiected the word ſacrament, as new and not found in ſcripture. But our aduerſaries the Caluiniſts (ſaith he) becauſe they find the word apt for them to ſhift and lurke vnder, very greedely embrace it, and make it their chief ground and ankerhold.

So nether baptiſme now, nor circumciſion then could be to ſuch men a ſeale and confirmation of iuſtice, which they then had not, nor novv haue.

For the word preached diſtinctly, and al the parts of it opened vp, muſt go before the hanging to of the ſacrament: and the ſacrament as a ſeale muſt folow and be appended there after. Then I cal a ſacrament the word and ſeale coniunctly, the one hung to the other. But here, ſome vvil perhaps obiect: vvhat need ſuch hanging of ſeales to the vvord, vvhereas the vvord of god is by it ſelf of ſufficient autoritie, and needeth no ſuch ſeales

for confirmation thereof. To this M. B. anſwerethPag. 49. 50 Calvin.

For there is no neceſsitie on gods part, but the neceſsitie cometh of vs. There is ſicke a great weakenes in vs and inhabilitie to beleeue: that to helpe this wonderful weakenes, whereby we are ready to miſtruſt god in every word, he hath hung to his ſacraments. Thus much for the general nature of ſacraments, as they are vſed in the Scottiſh congregation: vvherein there is ſcarce any one vvord, vvhich carieth not vvith it very ſovvle abſurditie, even againſt the firſt principles of Chriſtian faith. For to examine a litle the definition, vvhereon dependeth al, I demaund hovvamong Chriſtians can bread, or wine, or vvater (vvhich be the ſignes of baptiſme and the Supper) confirme the faith of the preached vvord? Is it in reſpect of the vvord it ſelf, or of Chriſtians to vvhom the vvord is ſent? Not of the vvord it ſelf. For that vvere iniurie to god, vvhoſe vvord it is, & therefore of ſufficient credit vvithout ſuch confirmation, as Caluin firſt, & next M. B. here graunteth. Then it remayneth to be in reſpect of Chriſtians. and here againe I muſt demaund, in reſpect of vvhat ſort of Chriſtians? ſtrong or vveake? perfit or vnperfit?

So that vvhereas ordinarily in common practiſe, vvhence theſe men take their Theologie in this point, ſeales confirme words and vvritings among men; and vvithout a ſcale the vvord and vvriting is of no great force or value in lavv to make a bond and obligation, the ſeale geuing al ſtrength & force thereto: here it is cleane contrarie. For al dependeth of the vvord, and the vvord geueth ſtrength, vertue and force to the ſeale, not the ſeale to the vvord; and the vvord vvithout the ſeale is altogether ſufficient, & carieth vvith it, ful, entier, and perfit authoritie, vvhereas the ſeale vvithout the vvord is nothing at al, but as M.

Chriſt firſt of al tooke bread in to his hands, and afterwards gaue thanks, and bleſſed, vvhich albeit it may ſeeme vſual and ordinarie; yet (ſaith Muſculus) it is not ſo, and the very vvords of ſcripture ſhevve, that it apperteyned to the order and inſtitution of a ſacrament. Here the miniſter cleane contrariwiſe, inuerting the order of Chriſt, firſt geueth at large a thanks, & after taketh the bread, the vvhich vvithout any thanks,2 or any vvord at al, he deliuereth to the people. Secondarily, Chriſt made a ſpecial and ſeueral thankeſ-giuing, & bleſsing, and ſanctification or conſecration, firſt of the bread and next of the cup, and this alſo he did as a thing perteyning to the verie order and inſtitution of his ſacrament. Here is no ſuch matter, but a confuſe thankes-geuing vvithout relation to ether, and vvhich conteyneth a bleſsing, ſanctification, or conſecration of nether. Chriſt did not only3 breake the bread once, and afterwards bid them breake and diſtribute it amonge them ſelues, but him ſelfe brake, and diſtributed and deliuered it to them ech one with his owne hand: ſignifying thereby, that it was not poſsible for them to haue any participation of grace except he gaue it them by the vertue of his ſpirite. Of vvhich point Muſculus geueth the reader a ſpecial warning and prouiſo. Here the miniſter loth belike to take ſo much paynes, leaueth that office to the people to diſtribute and diuide the bread amonge them ſelues (as though al grace came to them, from them ſelues vvithout Chriſt and his ſpirite, of vvhom they had no need) and vvithal he maketh a groſſe lye vpon Chriſt (which may ſtand for a fourth difference betvvene4

VVhereas in the quotations, with which they moſt fooliſhly paint their margent, there is no ſuch thing, but the cleane contrarie, as before out of the Goſpel, and the very places which they quote, by Muſculus hath beneſhevved. Chriſt mingled the5 cup vvhich he conſecrated: vvhich thing albeit Muſculus directly affirmeth not, yet he ſuppoſeth it moſt likely and probable, yea he nothing doubteth of it, being the vniuerſal cuſtome of the country. VVherevnto if he vvould adde, that the text of the Euangeliſts is indifferent, asMatth. 26. 27. Marc. 14. 23 Luc. 22. 20. 2.

Out of al vvhich, the fathers of this Councel of Conſtantinople conclude: If therefore any biſhop or prieſt folow not this order delivered by the Apoſtles, but offer the immaculate ſacrifice, not mingling water with wine (in the chalice) let him be depoſed from his office. This general, or rather vniverſal conſent & cuſtom of al Chriſtendome, coming thus directly from the Apoſtles, might ſuffiſe to overpeiſe for our ſide, eſpecially the vvord of the Goſpel being indifferent, or rather (cōpared vvith the old lavv) more bending to the ſame ſide.

No, it is a mere prophanation of baptiſme, and contempt of Chriſt and his ordinance. `The like is to be deemed of this your moſt arrogant & damnable tearing & renting in ſunder of Chriſts diuine myſterie; or rather cleane remouing and taking quit away of that which Chriſt appointed for the chief and principal: I ſay cleane remouing away, becauſe that forerunning talke out of the pulpit, being ſeparated frō the communion by ſo long tract of time and interpoſing of a Sermon, can be no more accompted any parcel of the communion, then the words of baptiſme vttered at eight of the clocke, are to be eſteemed a part of baptiſing or ſprinkling of the vvater, which enſueth 2. howres after.

In reſpect of this exhibition chiefly, that they are inſtruments to deliuer and exhibite the thing that they ſignifie, and not in reſpect only of their repreſentation, they are called ſignes.

                  there is a coniunction betwixt the word & the thing ſignified. Hauing explicated this at large, in fine thus he draweth to his concluſion. Alwaies looke what coniunction is betwixt

                  word conueyes the ſignification of a thing ſpoken, by the eare to the mind, ſo the ſacrament conveyes the ſignification by the eye to the mind. Here is the right and entier deſcription of al that which he calleth a coniunction, which in deed is no coniunction, but only a relation, and a relation voluntarie depending as al vvords do, be they viſible or audible, vpon the vvil of man (who hath authoritie to alter and chaunge them) and therefore ioynes things abſent no more then the power of man is able to ioyne them, which is nothing at al. For let vs a litle better examine and conſider theſe words, becauſe in them lieth the pith and ſubſtance of theſe mens nevvly inuented ſacramental ſigne: & M. B. after againe preciſely, diligently, and at large repeateth them as very important and

excellent wel deſcribing the coniunction of Chriſts bodyIn the 2. Sermon pa. 77. 78. with their ſigne. 
                     Euen (ſaith he) as when we heare named Paris, France, Calecut, the king, north, ſouth, things paſt and done in the beginning of the vvorld, things to come & to be done in the end of the vvorld; ſuch vvords cauſe mē if they marke them wel, to conceiue and in mynd to imagine the thing ſignified, which could not be except there were a coniunction betwene the word and the thing ſignified: euen ſo the bread and vvine cauſe vs to conceiue and imagine of Chriſts body: and ſo they are conioyned to Chriſts body, and Chriſts body to them. But by what reaſon is this called a coniunction? A coniunction of things importeth the things firſt, to be: next, to be ioyned and coupled together. But things which were done in the beginning of the vvorld, are not: things which ſhalChriſts body no vvays ioyned to the ſacrament. be done in the end of the vvorld, are not, they haue no eſſence, no being, they are nothing: and therefore can not be conioyned with any thing. And though Paris, France, Hieruſalem & Calecut be ſome things, and extant in the world, yet vvhen M. B. ſpake of them in his Sermon, they were no more cōioyned with his vvord, then thoſe other things paſt & to come, which are not, becauſe the vvord ſpoken is ſtil of one nature, and repreſenteth al things ſignified a like. So that in truth, this is no coniunction at al. And what can be more abſurd, then vvhen

If a right Zuinglian preach, vnto vvhom the SacramentBefore pag. 88. 89. is nothing els but as a ſoldiers colours, or a ſeruing mans badge (as Zuinglius vſually taught & vvrote) he after the ſermō ended, vvhē he ſeeth bread & vvine, muſt needs cōceiue thereof according as he hath hard the miniſter preach, and open vp the parts thereof: and ſo furth a number of ſuch ſignifications, and as proper, apt & conuenient one as the other muſt needs riſe, according

to the difference of miniſters ſermons, of mens conceites and fantalies. So that betvvene the bread and vvine, and Chriſts body and blud; there is no ſuch coniunction, as is betvvene vvords ſignifying & the things ſignifyed: for that the vvords in euery ſeueral nation at leſt, haue vſually one certaine ſignification; vvhereas the bread & vvine hath diuers, according to the diuers cōditions & opinions both of miniſters & of cōmunicants.
               
                   ¶ And vpon this ſame ground I farther infer againſtAny picture a better ſacrament then the Scottiſh ſupper. M. B. that a picture is a better and more diuine ſacrament, and hath a more neere coniunction vvith Chriſt, then hath the bread and vvine of their ſupper. And this I proue by M. B. his owne words, & preferre a picture before his bread & vvine by the ſame reaſon, by vvhich he goeth about to proue the contrarie. The bread andPag. 11 vvine (ſaith he) doth not only repreſent or ſignifie a thing abſent. For ſo any picture or dead image ſhould be a ſacrament, for there is no picture, as the picture of a king, but at the ſight of the picture the king wil come in to your mynd. Is it true? Hath a picture ſuch force and vertue to cavſe vs at the ſight thereof to remember the thing repreſented? Ergo a picture is a far better ſacrament then is your bread and vvine in the ſupper. For a picture (let it be for example ſake the picture of Chriſt crucified) at the firſt ſight of it, bringeth to the memorie of a Chriſtian, the death & paſſion of Chriſt; & ſo doth not your bread & vvine vvithout farther declaration, as your ſelf write.

                     The third aſſertion, that Chriſts body is not promiſed, nor geuē to be receiued corporally, is likewiſe refuted by plain ſcriptures, which teach a real and corporal eating, and not only by faith.
                  
                  
                      
                     Such corporal receiuing of Chriſt M. B. can not auoyd but by fooliſh and ſhameful peruerting of Chriſts words: whereof he geueth in this place a faire example, to the manifeſt abaſing of the Scottiſh Communion.

               And ſo this firſt error being thus diſproued, the ſecondAnſvvere to M. B. ſecond queſtion. vvhich dependeth theron, is by the ſame reaſon corrected. For as it is one propiner, ſo that vvhich is geuen, is geuen in one action; vvhich albeit M. B. ſtay not on, but vvith a ſimple negatiue paſſeth avvay; yet for the readers better information, I muſt tel him ſomwhat more at large, that the ſigne, and the thing ſignified is by the ſame Miniſter of the church, at one and in the ſame action & moment, exhibited and offered. The reaſon is, for that albeit Chriſt in heauen, and the Eccleſiaſtical miniſter in earth do differ; yet vvhen he in earth forgeueth ſinne, baptizeth, or conſecrateth the ſacrament, he doth it not as of him ſelf, but as by povver, and vertue, and authoritie cōmitted to him from Chriſt, & alſo (as hath bene ſaid) he doth it in the perſon of Chriſt: and ſo the action of Chriſt and his officer the prieſt, is the ſelf ſame in number, and no way to be accompted tvvo eccleſiaſtical

or rather ſacramental actions, hovv ſoeuer morally or phyſically the actions are diſtinguiſhed. As in like maner vvhen the king ſendeth a noble man or iudge with his cōmiſſion into ſome part of his realme, in matters of lavv, or othervviſe to take order for quiet gouernement of his realme: that vvhich the king doth by ſuch a iudge and deputie, or this noble man or iudge doth by the kings warrant and authoritie, is not in ciuil vviſedome and truth to be accompted tvvo ſeveral actions, but one: and much-more is that other of Chriſt and the prieſt, one & the ſelf ſame in Theologie.

Out of which this we may and muſt directly gather, that if, This is my body, be a promiſe depending of that condition and commaunde, Take eate, which goeth before, then when ſoeuer man on his part fulfilleth the condition & commaunde, God on the other ſide queſtionles performeth that he hath promiſed.

This therefore being a moſt ſure & vnremoveable ground; if theſe vvords▪

For like as he is a mad foole in Caluins iudgement vvho thinketh he can enioye the promiſe of Chriſts body, except he firſt obey the commaund of taking and eating▪
                   ſo if a man firſt obey and execute the commaund, that is to take and eate, if after any vvould deny him the promiſe, ſurely he muſt by Calvins ovvne iudgement and concluſion litle differ from a mad foole, yea an Apoſtata and plaine enemie of God, vvho could ſo fooliſhly and madly, and Apoſtatically, make God falſe in performing his promiſe. And therefore it muſt needs be inferred, that in every breakefaſt, every dinner, every beuer, every ſupper, every banquet, feaſt and collation, Chriſtian men receiue the body of Chriſt as truly and really, as in the Scottiſh, or any ſuch like Geneuian communion.

VVherefore by theſe ſo many eſſential parts required to their Scottiſh or Geneua ſigne, and not vſed or practiſed by Chriſt in his ſacrament, vve may aſſuredly conclude, that Chriſts ſacrament and their ſigne are of cleane different natures.

B.) for it as not very like that there was a ſermon at your chriſtening. And therefore this doctrine muſt of neceſsitie bring in rebaptization, & condemne the baptiſme of infants, which is flat Anabaptiſtical. For if that baptiſme be without life, at which the word of God is not preached, then can it not be effectual, and regenerate thoſe that were therewith baptized, and therefore it muſt of neceſsitie be iterated, that it may be livelie. Here is one reaſon, and the ſame very ſtrong, vvhereby M. B. him ſelf probably is proved no Chriſtian, as being not at al baptiſed (

               VVhich is one invincible argument for the Anabaptiſts concerning al Chriſtians of times paſt. Now let vs heare an other for thoſe that come hereafter. If baptiſmeIbi. pa.

Theologie, baptiſme muſt no more be miniſtred to children or infants, but we muſt expect with the Anabaptiſts, vntil they come to yeres of diſcretion, that then they hearing the miniſter preach, may haue the right ſacrament endued with life and ſowle and perfite eſſence, which now for want of ſuch preaching, is to them mere water without the ſpirite, a dead body without life or ſowle, and (as our Puritanes ſpeake, iuſt according to Caluin & M. B.) nothing but ſeales without writing and plain blanks. After, foloweth an authoritie of Zuinglius to prove his purpoſe, which becauſe it is very long, & would fil vp a leaf at leſt, I willingly omit. The ſumme of Zuinglius allegation, and my L. application is, that the word preached is not the life and perfection of the ſacrament, but that the ſacraments are perfite without it, and that M. B. and al other in teaching this doctrine, plainly ioyne hands with the Anabaptiſts. ThusIbi. pa. 568. my Lord of Canterbury. Vnto whoſe reaſons, one more I wil adde, which M. B. his preaching before, and the general doctrine of the ſacramentaries yeldeth againſt this toy, or rather madnes. It is agreed among them very generally,Before, pag. 115. 197. 198. that the baptiſme of S. Iohn was the ſelf ſame, that Chriſt & his Apoſtles after deliuered to the church & we now enioy. VVhich being ſo, then muſt it needs folovv, that it had the ſame matter & forme, the ſame elemēt & word that ours hath. This is evident, & can not be denyed. Let vs then proceed, & becauſe of the matter & element,
                  Chriſts Sacrament had no ſuch vvord as hath the Scottiſh. which was water in both, there is no controverſie; let vs conſider the forme, that is, the life and ſovvle, the word preached, without vvhich, baptiſme is nothing but water, as their other ſigne of the ſupper conteyneth nothing but cōmon bread. VVhen S. Iohn miniſtred baptiſme to Chriſt, did he preach the word, as here vve haue it defined?

did he with a cleere voyce denounce and proclame to Chriſt al the parts of baptiſme? Did he tel Chriſt vvhat was his owne part and dutie, as likevviſe what was Chriſts part & dutie? How Chriſt ought to come & receiue the baptiſme? and ſo furth, as here vve haue the vvord defined and explicated? Let M. B. make choiſe of vvhich part he vvil, and anſwere yea, or no; & I ſuppoſe he ſhal perceiue his ovvne error and foly; and that as in anſvvering truly, he muſt deny al his preaching hetherto about this VVord, ſo if he vvil ſtand to maynteine his vvord, and ſay that S. Iohn vſed in his ſacrament ſuch a word, ſuch preaching and opening al parts of the ſacrament, this affirmation in the iudgement of ſober men wil conuince him not ſo much of folie, as furie▪ not of hereſie, as of phreneſie: the particular conſideration vvhereof I leaue to him ſelfe.
               
                   ¶ Novv let vs a vvhile ſequeſter al authoritie both of god and man, of ſcripture and father, old or nevv, ſaving M. B. him ſelf, and examine this matter by it ſelf, according to indifferent trial, & M. B. his ovvne preaching. If vve marke vvel, vvhat vvord it is that he requireth to geue life to the ſacrament, vve ſhal find it to be ſuch a word, as proueth the tenth part of Engliſh and Scottiſh baptiſmes and communions to be no ſacraments at al. For firſt, vvhereas in very many churches of England,1 (and I thinke the like of Scotland) baptiſmes and communionsMany baptismes voyd. for vvant of Sermons. are miniſtred vvithout Sermons; in many▪ ſome poore homilie is read in ſteed of a Sermon; in al theſe churches the ſacraments are dead things, the communion bread is nought els but common bread, the vvater of baptiſme is cōmon prophane vvater, & nether of theſe any ſacrament. And that the reader thinke not my aſſeveratiō bold or ſtraunge, vvhere I ſay, that in England in many churches are ſo fevv Sermons, let him vnderſtand, that albeit there be in deed order preſcribed, that in euery pariſh church there ſhould be 4. ſermōs in the yere, euery quarter one, (vvhereas in the yere there are baptiſmes and communions perhaps 2. or 3. hundred) yet this is ſoil obſerued, that notvvithſtanding ſuch order takē,

                  as at an other more ſober ſermon (ifAt truly as the fleſh of Chriſt. any ſuch be) it ſignifieth the fleſh & blud of Chriſt. And the bread and vvine being appended afterward, ſerue as aptly in the one ſermon, time &, place, to ſeale and confirme the malicious and ſlaunderous eating of the fleſh of Biſhops and Chriſtian people, as in the other ſermon time and place, it ſerueth to ſeale and confirme the ſpiritual eating of Chriſts fleſh: and the vvord of the one ſermon determineth and limiteth as wel and perfitely the general ſignification of the bread and vvine to the one ſenſe, as the vvord of the other ſermon reſtrayneth it to the other ſenſe.
               Finally I conclude, that this doctrine is the high way5 to remove from the Cōmunion, al vvord of God, one or other, ether preached or not preached.

And this is the true & right iſſue of the nevv vvord deviſed by Iohn Caluin, and approved by M.

                      As before cap. 10. it is proved that they haue no ſacrament for want of the word, which is the formal part of the ſacramēt: ſo here by a brief repetition of ſundry things wanting in the material part (which things M. B. conſeſſeth to be of the ſubſtance of the ſacrament) it is manifeſtly concluded, that their ſupper is no ſacrament of Chriſts inſtitution, in reſpect of the matter, no leſſe then of the forme.

                   ¶ To come therefore to my concluſion, for ground and foundation thereof, I take M. B his vvords, vvhich he hath geven before in the beginning, & here in the end iterateth againe, and affirmeth as a moſt irrefragable and vndoubted veritie. In the beginning he told vs, that in the ſacrament are two ſorts of ſignes: ſignes elemental as bread & vvine, & ſignes ceremonial. He told vs vvithal, that there was neuer a ceremonie, which Chriſt inſtituted, but
                  Before, pag. 146. 
                  it was as eſſential, as the bread and wine. VVhat ever Chriſt commaunded to be done, what ever he ſpake, or did in that whole action, it is eſſential, it muſt be done, and no io

                  VVhen the ſacrament is ſpoyled of the eſſential forme, it is no ſacrament. There is an eſsential forme in baptiſme: and there is an eſſential forme in the ſupper: which if they be tane away, ye tyne the vſe of the ſacrament. The eſſential forme of baptiſme is, I baptize thee in the name of the father, of the ſonne, & of the holy ghoſt. Leave out any of theſe 3. or do it in the name of any one of the three perſons only, ye tyne the eſſential forme of baptiſme. In the ſupper, if ye leaue

Next, Chriſt 3. taking the bread in to his hands4 gaue thankes to his father, and vvithal 4. bleſſed & ſanctified5 the bread: after, he 5. tooke the cuppe in like maner,6 and geving thanks to his father 6. vvithal bleſſed & ſanctified the cuppe, as both the Evangeliſts, S. Paule, Caluin, Ievvel and Beza confeſſe. The Scottiſh ſupper hath no ſuch bleſſing, no ſuch ſanctification of the bread & vvine but purpoſely omitteth it: and therefore here are 2. more eſſential ceremonies tvviſe vſed by Chriſt, and yet neuer at any time vſed, but neglected and contemned by them in their miniſtration, & therefore their ſupper vvanteth ſomvvhat perteyning to his eſſence, and ſo is no ſacrament. Further more, 7. Chriſt did not once only breake the bread, & tooke to him ſelf a portiō, willing them to breake the reſt and diſtribute among them, but him ſelf did diſtribute

                  and breake it to them, and delivered it with his owne hands, ſignifying by that action, that it was not poſſible for any man to haue participation of his grace, except him ſelf
                  
                  gaue it. In the Scottiſh ſupper, the miniſter breaketh not the bread to everie communicant, he delivereth it not with his owne hand, as Chriſt did, and ſo he leaveth out a very important ceremonye, and therefore their ſupper can not be accompted Chriſts Sacrament. After Chriſt had taken the bread, geven thankes, bleſſed, broken, & ſo forth. finally for declaration that they might vnderſtād8 where vnto al the premiſſes tended, he ſpake theſe words which were moſt eſſential and concerned the ſubſtance of the ſacrament: This is my body, which is geven and broken
                  Vbi ſup. 
                  for yow: This is the new teſtament in my blud, which is ſhed for yow. Theſe vvords of Chriſt, vſed by Chriſt in the Inſtitution of his ſacrament, the Scottiſh miniſterieBefore. pag. 156. 160. vſeth not in the miniſtration of their ſupper. Ergo their ſupper is no Sacrament of Chriſt. To M. B. his ſuppoſed reply, that the vvords of Chriſt are not omitted, for that before the ſermon, the miniſter hiſtorically out of the pulpit mentioneth Chriſts inſtitution; anſvvere is already made, that this nothing helpeth them, but much more ſhevveth their infinite pride, and contemptuous breach of Chriſts order. For Chriſt firſt of al tooke the bread in to his hands, bleſſed it, brake it, & after pronounced thoſe vvords; they cleane contrary, firſt of al reherſe thoſe vvords out of the pulpit, vvhere there is no bread high them, much leſſe haue they the bread in their hands as Chriſt had. I anſvvere furthermore that ſuch hiſtorical narration (being told an hovvre or 2. before the cōmunion, and the entier Sermon coming betvvene) can haue no relation to the bleſſing or ſanctifying of their Supper. For as M. B. here telleth vs, there is an eſſential forme in baptiſme: there is an eſſential
                  Pag. 11. 
                  forme in the ſupper: which if they be tane away, ye tyne the ſacrament. The eſſential forme of baptiſme is (ſaith he) I baptiſe thee in the name of the father, of the ſonne, and of the holy ghoſt. And according to the order of the communionThe Scottiſh communion booke. booke, the miniſter as he ſpeaketh theſe words, taketh water in his hand, & layeth it vpon the childs forehead. VVhereby vve ſee that the eſſential forme is to haue the

words ioyned with the element: & if the miniſter ſpeake the words at one hovvre, & lay on vvater the next vvithout the vvords, he tyneth and deſtroyeth the eſſential forme of baptiſme, and ſo it is no ſacrament. Ergo by like reaſon vvhereas the ſacrament of Chriſts body hath a like eſſential forme as baptiſme hath; the Miniſter making a narration of Chriſts vvords before the ſermon as it vvere at 9. of the clocke, and after an hovvre, at ten delivering bread and vvine vvithout the vvords of Chriſt, tyneth and deſtroyeth the ſacrament of the ſupper, and ſo the Scottiſh ſupper is no ſacrament of Chriſt.
               Theſe fevv inſtances and exceptions for example ſake I geue to the Chriſtian reader, vvho may find a number of this ſort, if he pleaſe adviſedly to conſider that vvhich bath bene ſaid of this matter heretofore. And if novv according to M. B. his reſolution a man leaving out the leaſt ceremonie vſed by Chriſt in his ſupper, perverteth the

And if they haue no ſacrament, vvho lacke in the adminiſtratiō, any ſigne elemental or ceremonial, any material part, becauſe they be al ſubſtātial; how far are theſe men from having any ſhew, colour, pretence or ſimilitude of Chriſts Sacrament, who lack ſo many ſignes ceremonial & ſubſtantial! & beſides (vvhich is the head & top) leaue out cleane, al the vvords of Chriſt, vvhich in deed is the formal, & therefore the chief, ſoveraine, and principal part of the ſacrament; hovv ſoever it pleaſe theſe proud miniſters to take that honour frō theBefore, pag 217. 216. 218. vvord of Chriſt, & attribute it to their owne vvord. Truly as the Catholike, for ſundry other reaſons, hath iuſt cauſe to abhorre their bread and vvine, as polluted, as ſchiſmatical, as heretical, as leading the high vvay to Gods vvrath and indignation, to hel & damnation: ſo theſe arguments and reaſons geven & publiſhed by them ſelues ſuffiſe to proue as much, to proue their communion

a ſchiſmatical communion, cleane divided from Chriſts communion: a perverting, a corrupting and deſtroying of his holy ſacrament, vvith vvhich it hath no more reſemblance by this their ovvne confeſſion, then hath an ape vvith a man, copper vvith gold, hereſie vvith religion, and an angel of darknes vvith an angel of light. Yea many times ſpiritually ſprites of hel doubtles counterfeit Saints and Angels, and many apes or munkeys ſenſibly counterfeit the actions of men vvith more likelihood, colour and probabilitie, then theſe mens apiſh and ſpritiſh communion reſembleth the Divine Sacrament ordayned by our bleſſed Saviour.

                      Toat it is called menſa domini, our Lords table, maketh nothing againſt the ſacrifice, but rather for it.
                  
                      Of names by which the B. Sacrament (according to M. B. opinion) is called in the auncient fathers. It is not called a publique action, as by any proper name, nor yet a banquet of loue. VVhy it is called the Euchariſt.

                      But moſt commonly it was named the ſacrifice of Chriſts body, and as a true and real ſacrifice was offered vnto God in the church, euer ſince Chriſts time and firſt inſtitution of it. M. B. argument made to the contrarie anſwered.

The firſt nevv matter mentioned in this leſſon, is about names geven to the Sacramēt in holy ſcripture & auncient fathers; wherein he ſpeaketh ſome truth, which therefore I gladly embrace, as that it is called in the booke of god, The body and blud of Chriſt (and neverPa. 56. the figure, trope, ſigne or ſeale of that body and blud) and therefore belike that being the proper name, conteyneth alſo in proprietie of ſpeech what it is.

B.) the ſupper of the lord: not a prophane ſupper, not a ſupper appointed for the belly: for Chriſt had ended the ſupper that was appointed for the belly, or ever he began this ſupper which was appointed for the ſowle.

being ſo, that S.

For theſe vvords, VVhen yow meete together, this is not to eate our lords ſupper, for that every one preventeth and falleth to his owne private ſupper, and one is a hungred, another is drunke, can haue no other proper & natural reſolution then this: vvhen yow meete together, that vvhich yovv eate, is not that publike eccleſiaſtical & brotherly ſupper of charitie, of god, of Chriſt and his church, vvhich ſhould be common to al the ſocietie of Chriſtians, but it is a private & peculiar ſupper voyd of al charitie & brotherly loue, vvhere one devoureth al, an other hath nothing, one hath to much and is drunke vvith abundance, vvhen many other poore Chriſtians ſtand by & get never a morſel of bread, or draught of drinke. This is the true ſenſe of the place of S. Paule, & of this vvord vſed in that only place, & no vvhere els in the ſcriptures: & this ſenſe both Beza and Caluin geve after thoſe auncient doctors. And therefore M. B. hath litle reaſon to cal the ſacrament the lordes ſupper by this authoritie. And if the compilers of the Scottiſh Publike prayer booke had no other reaſon but this, they might as vvel haue called their ſacrament, as our Enghiſh do, by the name of Cōmunion, which cometh ſomwhat neerer to S.

                  ſo far, that it hath turned over our ſacramēt in to a ſacrifice: and where we ſhould take fro the hand of god in Chriſt, they make vs to geue. This is plaine idolatrie. And therefore where the word was tolerable before, now it is no ways tolerable. To ſpeake a litle of theſe 4. names, although the ſacrifice be a publike action, yet vvhere the fathers vſed to cal it ſo as by a particular name, is hard to find. In the church of Chriſt, catechizing before baptiſme, baptiſme it ſelf, is & hath bene vſed as a publike action; ſo hath the geving of orders, and making prieſts, confirmation, preaching, and diuers other ſacraments, and eccleſiaſtical offices: yea in ſome reſpect theſe haue bene far more publike actions then the ſacrament; for that many vnchriſtened vvere publikely admitted to catechiſmes & preachings, vvhich vvere carefully excluded frō being preſent at the celebration of the ſacrifice or ſacrament, both in the

The terme, banquet of loue, is ſomvvhat more ſtraunge, & as I thinke, more ſeldom vſed. True it is, the ſacrament is a banquet of love, as vvhereby vve are moved, firſt to loue god, and then one an other; as likevviſe it is a banquet of faith, of peace of mildnes, of patience, of modeſtie,Galat. 5. 22. of ſobrietie, of chaſtitie, of al vertues, vvhich gods holy ſpirite eſpecially by meanes of this bleſſed ſacrifice vvorketh in the receivers.

For if in collecting the 4. names vvhich out of the aūcient fathers he attributeth to the ſacrament, he had faithfully told his auditorie vvhat he had found, he could not haue ſo blindly ſtumbled, as to vvring idolatrie out of a ſacrifice, or preach that the ſacrifice began vvith the name of Maſſe, vvhereas the more auncient fathers cal the ſacrament a true ſacrifice, ſome hundreds of yeres before the decaying and falling time of the church vvhich he ſignifieth, that is, before the name of Maſſe vvas practiſed. And vvhen the name Maſſe began to grovv in vſe, even then they ſtil reteyned that other more auncient terme; and caled it ſtil ſacrifice both in preaching & vvriting, ten, yea tvventie times for one, more oft then Maſſe.

That as he who hath bread and wine, lacks nothing to the ful nurriture of his body, ſo he who hath the participation of the body and blud of Chriſt, lacks nothing to the ful and perfite nurriture of his ſowle. To repreſent this ful and perfite nurriture, the ſignes of bread and wine in the ſacrament were ſet downe and inſtituted. Thus much for the firſt. The ſecond end, wherefore this ſacramēt was inſtituted is, that to the world

And therefore both among the faithful & faithles, Iewes and Pagans, as likevviſe Ievves and Chriſtians, the ſacraments are ſome ſignes of mutual love and benevolence, and by them we teſtifie our religion, as Chriſtians towards the true god, ſo infidels to the falſe.

any good man may make many a ſacrament as good as this, and better to, if ſuch ſignification be the chief and beſt part of it. But that we deceiue not ourſelues & miſconſter M.

                  that as nothing is meeter to waſh with then water, ſo nothing is meeter to waſh the ſowle, then the blud of Chriſt. And the reaſon why in baptiſme is but one ſigne, that is water alone, is this, becauſe water is ſufficient inough to do the whole turne. But in the other ſacrament it is not ſo; there muſt be two. VVine

Therefore that they might repreſent a perſit nurriture, Chriſt hath geuen vs both bread and wine (for the perſit nurriture corporal ſtands in meate and drinke) to repreſent the ful and perſit nurriture of the fowle. Here is the chief and ſupreme ſacramental grace of the Scottiſh and Geneua ſigne.

ſpeaketh truly, ſo in that ſenſe bread by it ſelf, or bread and vvater, or mylke and hony, or fleſh, or fiſh, is a ful & perfite nurriture, and may ſignifie Chriſt as vvel, and ſo ſerue as vvel for a ſacrament. If he ſpeake (as he ſeemeth) after the vulgar ſenſe of men, namely of our countrymen in Scotland & England, vvhere bread ſignifieth one ſpecial and particular kind of food, and vvine an other: then is his vvord falſe, & then doth not his ſacramental bread and vvine repreſent Chriſt as a perfite and ful nurriture of our ſovvles; for that only bread and vvine are not ful & perfite nurriture of our bodies according to our ſpeech, faſhion, and dyet: and ſo is his ſacramental ſigne a falſe ſigne and ſeale, vvhich ſealeth a falſe doctrine, as not having a perfite repreſentation of ful and perfite nurriture. And albeit againſt the right ſacrament of the church,Note. vvhere the principal part of the ſacrament is an other maner of grace, vertue, and ſanctification, vvhereof this ſignificative qualitie dependeth, as an accident of the ſubſtance, as an acceſſorie of the principal, this argument be vveake & concludeth nothing: yet againſt them who make not any ſpiritual effect and operation, but ſuch tropical figuring and repreſentation, the chief effect, and ſubſtance of the ſacrament, the argument ſtandeth ſtrong & forcible, ſufficient to deſtroy the vvhole entier ſacrament, becauſe it deſtroyeth the perfit ſignification, vvherein the ſacrament principally & chiefly conſiſteth.

The Catholike church reſting vpon Chriſts vvorde aſſuring her, that it vvas his body before the diſciples received it; vpon confidence and aſſurance of the ſame vvord, doubteth not but that it is his body, as betvvene the pronouncing of Chriſts vvords and the receiving, if there come the ſpace of an howre betwene, ſo if there come the ſpace of ten howres or a hundred betvvene: becauſe the veritie thereof hangeth not vpon mens e

                     fort him ſelf with remiſsion of his ſinnes. Thus then by this Proteſtants doctrine, confirmed by ſo many textes of ſcripture, ſo many good reaſons, vvith approbatiō of the primitive church, one man alone may as vvel receive

the ſacrament, as he alone may be preached vnto, as h
                     •
                   alone may be comforted, or looke to have remiſſion of his ſinnes by the death of Chriſt. So that for theſe two points, the firſt, that holines and ſanctification remaineth in the ſacrament longer then the action or table ſervice endureth: the ſecond, that the ſame ſacramēt may be communicated to one man alone, M. B. is controlled by manifeſt reaſon, by plaine and manifold ſcripture, by the auncient fathers and primitive Catholike church, and alſo by the late fathers of the primitive Proteſtant church. And doubtles M. B. & Caluins opinion is herein moſt blunt, vvicked, and voyd of al vvit or Chriſtian ſenſe. Only in excuſe of them it may be anſwered, that thoſe auncient fathers S. Dionyſius, S. Auſtin, S. Cyprian, Tertullian, &c. ſpeake of ſacrament, vvhich according to Chriſts vvord hath in it Chriſts body; vvhereas M. B. and Calvin ſpeake of a Scottiſh & Geneva ſeale, of a late invention, to vvhich Chriſts body is no more ioyned, then the Sphere of Saturne is ioyned to the earth: no othervviſe then the body of Chriſt is ioyned to any other vulgar bread or meate, ſigne or ſeale. And therefore the fathers ſpeach, that the ſacrament continueth vvith his grace & ſanctification after the communion or ſacrifice▪ and may be miniſtred to any Chriſtian privatly▪ is true as the fathers meant of the Chriſtian ſacrament: and M. B. ſpeaking of his Geneva

                  oy, vvhich hath only for ſome time a poore ſignification vvith it, but never for any time, any grace or power of ſanctification in it, is likewiſe true: vz▪ that after the table ſervice is ended, there continueth no holines in that, vvherof it had in deed no dramme or iote before; and therefore being miniſtred to one alone abſent can do no good, vvhich doth rather harme then good to the ſocietie and congregation preſent.

                  The Argument.
                  
                      An argument which M. B. maketh for the catholike opinion out of S. Paule. His anſwere thereto is fond, and directly againſt the text of S. Paule, which withal he fowly corrupteth. The auncient fathers out of that place of S. Paule proue, that evil men receiue Chriſts body in the ſacrament: & ſo much is implied in the very forme of S. Paules ſpeech being with indifferencie examined.
                  
                      Another ſlender argumēt touching the receiving of evil men, made by M. B. which yet he can not anſwere.
                  
                      Againſt M. B. and the Calviniſts, denying that evil men receiue Chriſt in the Supper, it is proved that according to the Proteſtants doctrine, and M. B. his preaching, Chriſt is there received of al ſorts of men indifferently, not only ſuch as be of naughtie life, but alſo of evil and heretical faith, if they be not plain Apoſtataes.
                  
                      Of the Calviniſts ſpecial iuſtifying faith, by which laſt refuge as al Catholikes be excluded from their ſpiritual communicatiō of Chriſt, ſo yet other moſt deteſtable heretikes thereby receiue Chriſt as wel as the Calviniſts. And their doctrine of ſpecial faith (the very roote of diſſolute life) plainely & directly concludeth againſt M. B. that in their ſupper the worſt Calviniſts receiue Chriſt as wel as the beſt.

The ſelf ſame may be conceived of a number of like examples. If the miniſter ready to baptize a child, and perceiving his hands ſowle, take a handful of vvater out of the font▪ and firſt vvaſh his hands: albeit he playeth a ſluttiſh part and offendeth, yet no vviſe man vvil ſay, he is gilty of Chriſts body and blud: no more then he is gilty of the kings body and blud vvho (to vſe M. B. his example) having the kings image and ſeale in wax by him, and vvanting vvax to ſcale his owne letter, breaketh the kings ſeale and applieth it to his owne vſe. Theſe ſimilitudes are of like condition & qualitie: & therefore whereas for not diſcerning the body and blud of Chriſt in the ſacrament, a man is condemned as gilty of Chriſts body, and he is not ſo in any of theſe matters; hereof it is plainly inferred, that Chriſts body is otherwiſe in the ſacrament, vvhereof S.

               Of tuitching Chriſt corporally and ſpiritually.
               
                  The Argument.
                  
                      M. B. guilefully magnifieth the ſpiritual manducation by faith, to exclude the ſpiritual manducation ioyned with corporal manducation in the ſacrament.
                  
                      The definition of faith geven by S. Paule, and cited by M. B. is examined, and by it is cleerly proved, that the Proteſtant faith, which they cal ſo, is no faith, ſuch as S. Paule meaneth, but mere fanſie and imagination.
                  
                      Chriſt in this world did esteeme of carnal cognation, which M. B. wickedly denieth.
                  
                      His wicked corruption of Chriſts words, that Chriſts fleſh is vnprofitable, is directly againſt Chriſts owne preaching, and our faith of the incarnation. He in taking from the body al real coniunction with Chriſt, infinuateth a denyal of the reſurrection of the body, as Luther and the Lutherans prove plainly againſt the Calviniſts.
                  
                      M. B. his obiection taken out of the Goſpel, that corporal tuitching

of Chriſt is vnprofitable. VVhy Chriſt required faith, & what maner of faith in them whom he cured from diſeaſes. The place of ſcripture which M. B. obiecteth (as likewiſe many other) proveth the cleane contrarie of th

Next, he plaieth an heretical part, in geving to Chriſts words vvhat interpretation and meaning him ſelf pleaſeth, expounding that of Chriſts only fleſh, vvhich the very drift & circumſtance of the place proveth not to be meant of Chriſts fleſh, or any fleſh at al, but only of fleſhly and carnal vnderſtanding of Chriſts ſpiritual vvords, according to a common phraſe of ſcripture.

They are not fleſh, nor to be vnderſtood after a fleſhly ſort, as do theſe Capernaites. For ſo they are not life. They are to be vnderſtood & comprehended by faith, not by ſenſe or reaſon: which faith becauſe yow want, and folovv your ſenſe and carnal conceites, therefore yovv are offended at them.

                  tuitching of Chriſt never was profitable, is not, nor neuer ſhal be profitable. Theſe vvords as the Chriſtian reader may eaſely ſee, tend to evacuate and diſanul moſt of Chriſt and his Apoſtles actions here in this vvorld. If he had ſaid, that faith vvas requiſite in thoſe that ſonght to Chriſt for helpe, as Chriſt him ſelf teacheth, like as the phiſicion of his patient requireth credit and obedience, that he truſt him & obey him, before he vvil vndertake to cure him; he had ſpoken like a Chriſtian, and like a true preacher, and one that had a litle marked the ſcriptures, vvhereof they talke ſo much, and (for ought may appeare) vnderſtand ſo litle. But to attribute al to the faith of the partie, and to vvithdraw it from al other actions, vnto which it is as properly, yea more properly due; this is diſhonorable to Chriſt, and quit beſides, yea againſt the vvhole ſtorie of the Goſpel. Chriſt coming in to the vvorld and preaching amonge the Iewes for this end, that he might plant his faith amongeſt them, ever vrged them to this faith, required of them this faith, vvithout this faith ſeeldom did any miracles, & ſomtimes (as the Euāgeliſts expreſleMarc.

B. falleth in hand vvith comparing together the Scottiſh communion, and the maſſe: and then to make certaine arguments againſt the real preſence of Chriſt in the ſacrament; in vvhich how like he is to do any great harme to the maſſe or Catholike faith, the reader may gheſſe by this, that queſtionles he knoweth not, nor vnderſtandeth the matter whereof he pretendeth toVntruthes groſſe and manifeſt. ſpeake: but in declaratiō thereof, povvreth out ſuch groſſe vntruiths▪ and ignorant aſſertions, as the vvorſt miniſter in Scotland perhaps vvould be aſhamed of.

VVe ſay there is no vertue reſident in the ſyllables, but we ſay that the vertue is reſident in the perſon of the ſonne of God: and he workes by his owne word vttered by a lawful prieſt as in the Catholike church, not by the ſermon of a ſeditious miniſter, vvhoſe ſermon can not be called the owne word of Chriſt. And thus much for that. The other vntruths of chaſing away the bread, & pulling downe Chriſts fleſh from heaven I pretermit: becauſe if he thus ſpeake in ſcorne and deriſion, I vvil not loſe time nor ſpend words ſo vainely, as to talke of them. If he vtter them in ſadnes, they are to groſſe and ſenſible falſities, and cary their refutation vvith them as proceding from ſhameful & intolerable ignorāce of the Catholike faith, vvhich he goeth about to refute. If by ſuch odious & ſlaunderous maner of ſpeech he meane to diſgrace the Catholike beleef; inough hath bene ſaid in defence thereof already, ſo as I need not to make any

I meane ſo, that where ever the body be, it is limitate within that place: & while it is there, it can not be els where. This is M. B. his firſt general principle and ground, vvherein are conteyned al his firſt kind of arguments, in number 3. of vvhich one is here propoſed already. For out of this philoſophical principle: Euery humaine body muſt have theſe in ſeparable qualities, he argueth, 1. that Chriſts body muſt be in a certain place. 2. that it muſt be finit and circumſcribed, which as he vſeth it, is al one vvith the former, and therefore I vvil ioyne them together.

                     . to the particulars. Theſe 3. properties are inſeparable to euery body ſaith he. If he meane of al bodies vniuerſally, it is not true. For nether the element of ayer, vvhich is a true body, is palpable and viſible, much leſſe the element of fier above the ayer: nor the vvhole vvorld it ſelf, nor the firſt heaven, vvhich conteyneth in it al thing, is in a certain place, as common philoſophie and Ariſtotle defineth a place, and as al other bodies are in a certain place. If he meane of humaine bodies, as he ſeemeth, and his diſcourſe and application pretendeth, then is it moſt falſe that theſe properties agree to the body of man quarto modo, as the Logicians ſay. For they agree to the body of a horſe and an ox, of every ſtone and tree, as vvel, as to the body of a man. And therefore in ſo ſpeaking, he ſpeaketh not like a Logiciā, nor like a reaſonable man. If he ſay, at leſt theſe are properties neceſſarie to everie mans body and vnſeparable: and ſo they are proper to it ſome way, at leſt ſecūdo modo, as the Logicians ſay: as now he ſpeaketh more truly, and by ordinarie courſe of nature they are in deed neceſſarie and vnſeparable; ſo yet they are no moreQualities neceſſarie to human bodies. neceſſarie to the body of man, then it is to the ſame body of man to eate, to drinke, to take reſt, to ſleepe, to encreaſe, to decreaſe, to tend to corruption, to take the nature and frame of his body from a father and mother. And the philoſophers vvho knew nothing of faith, nor the reſurrection of humane bodies to life eternal; and by humane reaſon and vvit aſſigned to humane bodies according to the drift of humane reaſon, of the courſe of nature and this vvorld, thoſe 3. properties vvhich M. B. noteth; vvould never haue denyed theſe other which I adioyne, to be as neceſſarie, and inſeparable as thoſe. For albeit Adam and Eve vvere made vvithout father and mother, vvhich both after vvere as other bodies, finite, in a certain place and ſo forth; yet that creation is a matter of faith, not of philoſophie: & that very creatiō both of man & beaſt vvas a greater miracle, & is more repugnant to nature, then a body to be inviſible, or vvithout a certaine

For the ſecond, that Chriſts body being an humaine body is circumſcribed; leaving many doctors purpoſely I take me to Auſtin (quoth M.

               Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of his father, that is to ſay, he is made lord of heaven and earth: God hath placed him in ſupreme gouernemēt over al▪ and al things in heaven and earth he hath ſubiected vnder him, ſo that there is no creature, but is obedient to his commaundement: that is in one vvord: He is omnipotent.

                  THE arguments propoſed in the laſt chapter, are M. B. his principal argumēts, which as very principal have bene heretofore preſſed againe and againe by the greater Rabbines of the ſacramē
                  tarie ſynagoge: and becauſe they ſeeme conſonant to humane reaſon, and are beautified vvith the name of one auncient father of greateſt eſtimation, may ſeeme to cary ſome credit; though being indifferently wayed they are very light and prove nothing. The reſt that folow, are for the moſt part (as I gheſſe) his owne. For ſo the povertie and miſerablenes of them maketh me to thinke. One or other of them vvas at the beginning vſed by Zuinglius and Occolampadius; but are al of one faſhion and grace; ſome Iudaical, ſome heretical, ſome founded vpon manifeſt lyes, ſome plaire derogatorie to Chriſts glorie: al ſond and contemptible, vvithout any pith; vvhich therefore I vvil the more briefly runne ouer. The firſt is. The effect of the ſacramēt is ſpiritual.

This argument is more meet for a Iew then a Chriſtian.Anſvvere. It is as good againſt Chriſts real incarnation, death and paſſion, as againſt the ſacrament. For if a corporal preſence of Chriſt can vvorke no ſpiritual effect, then nether did his incarnation any good, nor death, nor paſſion. The next. If the bread

VVherefore as to a ſacrament is required only, that there be an external ſigne repreſenting the internal gift, ſo this is fully don by the external figure alone: as the braſenNum. 21. 9. Ioan. 3. 14. ſerpent in the old teſtamēt vvas a ſacramēt of Chriſt, & very fully and ſufficiently repreſented him, albeit in that vvere no true ſubſtance and nature of a ſerpent, but only the external ſhape. Thirdly I demaund, vvhere findeth3 M. B. in al the Euangeliſts, in S. Paule, in Chriſts words, that this ſacrament vvas appointed to ſignifie ſpiritual nurriture? vvhich vvas in deed appointed to nurriſh ſpiritually to life eternal. Again, it is falſe that the accidents4 in the ſacrament do not nurriſh▪ and true it is, that even in ordinarie food, meat and drinke doth nurriſh by reaſon and meane of the accidents. Furthermore, as the fathers5 teach vs, that to the ſacrament is required bread for this ſignification of ſpiritual nurriture, ſo the ſame fathers tel vs, and ſo doth S. Paule him ſelf, though not ſo plainly,1. Cor. 10. 17. that the ſacramental bread ſignifieth our myſtical vnion and coniunction one vvith an other. Our Lord (ſaithAuguſt. in Ioā. tract. 26 S. Auſtin) commended to vs his body in thoſe things which of many are made one. Of many vvheate cornes is made the bread, of many grapes is made the vvine: vvhich is alſoCypr. lib. 1. epiſt. 6. the ſimilitude of S. Cyprian, and very largely proſecuted in the Engliſh and Scottiſh communion, vvhere thus the brothers and ſiſters ſinge.

                  So is the Lord and his whole Church
                  Though he in heauen ſit.
                  As many grapes make but one wine,
                  So ſhould vve be but one
                  In faith and loue &c.
               
               Theſe ſignifications and more be in the ſacramental bread and vvine of the Engliſh and Scottiſh Communion. And yet as I ſuppoſe nether the Engliſh not the Scottiſh miniſters thinke it neceſſarie, that vvhen they miniſter the communion, there be preſent in the congregation,

reaping, and threſſhing, & grinding, and baking, and ſo forth: nether yet that in their cup being made of vvine or ale, there be many ale cornes or many grapes; or in the bread, many wheat cornes, to ſignifie the vnitie of the lord with the congregation, as alſo the vnitie of the bretherne and ſiſterne one vvith an other in faith and love: but it is counted ſufficient, that to the matter of the ſacrament theſe things vvere requiſite, before it could be made bread or vvine. If he thus thinke and anſwere (as he muſt of neceſſitie) then he anſwereth him ſelf, that it ſuffiſeth this ſacrament in the Catholike church to be made of bread and vvine, vvhich ſignifie ſpiritual nurriture, though after conſecration the ſubſtance of nether remayne, vvhich yet nurriſh even then ſufficiently, to performe that vvhich his argument requireth.

                     . This in deed he muſt ſay. But in ſo ſayng he ſpeaketh vvickedly, heretically, and damnably: and quit diſanulleth, maketh voyd, and diſgraceth the blud of Chriſt, the

blud of the new teſtament. And the blud of an ox, of a goate, of a calf in the old law, may ſerve M. B. for his figurative & tropical ſpeech. For ſo that vvas tropically in deed the new teſtament, vvhich it ſignified and figured. But the blud of Chriſt is more truly and properly, & after a more divine ſort called the new teſtament, ether for that it is the ſpecial and principal legacie and gift beſtowed on vs by Chriſt in his new teſtament: or becauſe it is the very founteyne of grace, vvhich is likewiſe geuen properly in the new Teſtament, and vvhereby vve have right to glorie and life eternal, which is the conſequent of grace and effect thereof in the new teſtament. For this and ſuch like cauſe, is Chriſts blud (as in the chalice) called the new teſtament: the confirmatiō of vvhich teſtament conſiſted in the death of Chriſt, & effuſion of the ſame blud on the croſſe. As for figuring, and ſignifying, that is no cauſe of this appellation. And therefore to ſay, This is the new teſtament, that is, This ſignifieth or figureth the new teſtament, is to make the blud of Chriſt no better then the blud of a beaſt: vvhich is a propoſition fitter for a beaſt or a miniſter (vvho in ſo ſpeaking litle diſſereth from a beaſt) then for a Chriſtiā man. If againſt this M. B. vvil ſtil cavil to find out here a figure; let him take this for a final anſwere, that this ſpeech of S. Luke moſt effectual and ſignificant, though not ſo proper or common, is properly expreſſed by S. Matthew and S. Marke, This is my blud of the new teſtament; vvhich is a ſufficient commentarie to expound S.Matth. 26. Marc. 14. Luke, and quite excludeth al his tropes and figures: except he alleage as plaine & ſufficient authoritie to make thoſe vvords of Chriſt (This is my body) tropical, vvherevnto he reſerreth al theſe his examples. The laſt example of S. Paule calling Chriſt a rocke, is a figure liken to this former. A figure there is one vvay, but not as M. B. meaneth. That the vvorde rocke is applied to Chriſt, isHovv the rock vvas Chriſt. a metaphore and figure: as vvhen he is called a lyon, a lamb▪ a doore, a vine, &c. But vvhere he ſaith, that vve are ſpecially compelled here to graunt his ſacramental, that is,

his tropical and ſignificative ſpeech more then in the reſt, ſurely herein he is very ſpecially deceiued. For vvhen S. Paule ſaith, the rock was Chriſt, vve are not compelled to expound him thus: the rock ſignified Chriſt, but the true ſenſe may be the literal, that the rock vvas Chriſt. S.1. Cor. 10. 4. Paules vvordes are: They drunke of the ſpiritual rock, which folowed them: and the rock was Chriſt. That rocke which folowed the Hebrewes in the deſert, vvhich guided, directed and ſuſteined them, can not probably be expounded of a material rocke (although ſome of the Hebrew Rabbines have ſuch an imagination) but of the ſpiritual rocke, vvhich ſpiritual rocke did not ſignifie Chriſt, but vvas Chriſt. And thus S. Chryſoſtom, S. Ambroſe, Theodoretus and others expound it: and the rocke in S. Paule referred to the vvord ſpiritual, vvhich goeth next before, iuſtifieth this plaine and literal interpretation. And ſo nether this ſpecial place, vvhich M. B. maketh ſuch accompt of, compelleth vs to his trope and figure.

VVhich literal and hiſtorical ſenſe muſt firſt be reſolved vpon, before he can ſo ſpecially preſſe and beare vs downe vvith his ſpiritual ſenſe and figuring.

Ergo it is ſo. This is the firſt vntruth, and ground of his wickedVntruth. diſputation vvhich enſueth, conſiſting altogether of falſhod and ignorance. Catholikes make no ſuch ſcald arguments: vvhich prove as vvel, every rakehel heretike to be as good as the beſt Catholike, every Turke as good as any Chriſtian, black vvhite, durt gold, fiſh fleſh, and vvhat not? For God can make of an heretike a Catholike, of a Turke a Chriſtian, of durt gold, and ſo forth. The Catholikes ſometimes againſt the heretiks vvhich deny (as doth M. B.) Gods omnipetencie to extend thus far, prove that God can do it. VVhich is not to make arguments, that becauſe he can do it, therefore he doth it but to refute ſuch blaſphemous ſpeeches, vvhich detract from God, and deny the firſt article of their Creed, that God is omnipotent. In anſwering of this argument, vvhich he fathereth on vs, albeit he ſhew him ſelf to ignorant, ſo that in deed he ſeemeth not to know vvhat a contradiction meaneth; yet he ſo behaveth him ſelf, as that he may plainly learne it by his owne anſwere to this ſuppoſed argument. For vnto it he geveth 3. anſweres, two of vvhich are directly contradictorie one to the other: the third hangeth in the middeſt betwene both,Pag. 1

But good Sir, that we may vnderſtand your further reſolution, let vs put the caſe, as the church ever hath, that God may wil it, for that Chriſt vvho is true God, did wil it, as not only al Catholikes that ever vvere, but alſo moſt Proteſtants, and thoſe the firſt founders of this new goſpel beleeved. Anſwere now directly and plainlyGods omnipotencie moſt vvickedly denied. yea or no, can he performe it? M. B. anſwereth no: and that ſo Turkiſhly & abſurdely, as vvithal he overthroweth the vvhole body of ſcripture, from the beginning of Geneſis to the end of the Reuclation. For (ſaith he) many things God may not wil (and then moſt aſſuredly he nether may nor can do them) and they are reduced to two ſortes. Firſt, he may not wil things contrarie to his nature, as to
                  Pag. 158. 
                  be changeable, to decay. Secondly, he may not wil ſome things by reaſon of a preſupponed condition: as ſuch things, whereof he hath concluded the contrarie before: of which ſort this is. For ſeing God hath concluded, that al humane bodies, and therefore the body of Chriſt, ſhould conſiſt of organical parts, and therefore be comprehended and circumſcribed within one proper place, therefore God may not wil the contrarie now, and conſequently can not make it vvithout quantitie, vvithout place, vvithout circumſcription; for this vvere to make it no body. And to wil theſe things which are plaine cōtradicēt in them ſelues god may not, no more then it is poſsible for him to wil a lye. Here is the concluſion: that God can no more make Chriſts body remaining a body, to be in 2. places, then he can lye, then he can be chaunged, th
                        •

Ergo it is ſimply beyond Gods power and abilitie, to make the body of Chriſt in the ſacrament. This is his concluſion, which if vve let to reſt for a vvhile, and examine the ground thereof, a man ſhal quickly ſee, that it is the very foundation of al Atheiſme and Barbariſme. For if God may not, nor can alter the conditions and qualities of his creatures, vvhich conditions he hath framed in them, and ſo by ſuch proſupponed condition concluded the contrarie before; vvhereas he hath thus concluded the vvater to be

For he is learned in reſpect of common miniſters, vnlearned in reſpect of Iohn Calvin, Theodore Beza and ſuch other Rabbines: falſe, becauſe he vttereth many vntruths and corrupteth many places of the ſcripture and fathers; true, becauſe he ſpeaketh many truths and lyeth nothing ſo oft, nor corrupteth ſcriptures and fathers ſo notoriouſly as our M.

And though they be applied and referred to one and the ſelf ſame ſingular body, yet do they nothing impaire, hinder, or deſtroy the nature or ſubſtance, becauſe they are accidental conditions vvhich come after the nature, and vvithout vvhich the nature is perfect, ful, and abſolute.

                  The Argument.
                  
                      The concluſion drawen out of the precedent diſcourſe & preaching of M. B. ſheweth that whereas al religion, eſpecially Chriſtian cōſiſteth principally of two partes, 1. faith towards God, 2. honeſt, & charitable behavicur towards men: both theſe the Calvinists vtterly deſtroy by their preaching of only and ſpecial faith: and therefore their goſpel hath no ſhew or face of any religion. Theſe 2. partes are proued ſeverally; firſt touching good life: next, touching neceſſarie points of Chriſtiā ſaith. For which cauſe, euer ſince the beginning, this Calvinian goſpel hath bene abherred and condemned not only by al Catholikes, but alſo by very many Proteſtants, and thoſe of moſt ſame and learning.
                  
                      The Caluinian goſpel is nothing ſo coloured with probable ſhew of Chriſtianitie, as were many old hereſies. The preachers of it are much more variable, mutable, & contrarie to them ſelues: and therefore the ſhame, miſerie, and condemnation of men is greater, who have departed from the Catholike and Apoſtolike faith of al ages, vnto it.
                  
                      The nature of the Caluinian and Sacramentarie Goſpel is never to be conſtant, but to be always chaunging: the ſolowers whereof are neuer ſetled in any one certain faith. For which reaſon, and alſo for that in many chief articles it diſſenteth from the Goſpel of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; as moſt Scottiſh
