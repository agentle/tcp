                  THe dayes Triumph ended, to the great Honour of the City, and content of his Highneſſe, who out of the goodneſſe of his loue, gaue the Lord Maior and Aldermen many thankes.
               On Monday following, the Lords and Peeres of the Realme being all aſſembled at White-hall, his Highneſſe then proceeded in this maner to his Creation.
               Firſt went the Trumpets, then the Heralds and Officers of Armes in their rich Coates; next followed the Knights of the Bath, beeing ſixe and twentie in number, apparelled in long robes of purple Sattin, lined with white Taffata; then ſir William Segar Knight, aliâs Garter, principall King of Armes, bearing the Letters Patents, the Earle of Suſſex the Purple Robes, the Traine borne by the Earle of Huntington, the Sword by the Earle of Rutland, the Ring by the Earle of Derby, the Rodde by the Earle of Shreweſbury, the Cappe and Coronet by the Duke of

                  Lenox, Lord Steward, his Princely Highneſſe ſupported by the Earles of Suffolke and Nottingham, came bare-headed, and ſo entred the great Hall, where the King was ſet in his royall Throane, and the whole State of the Realme in their Order; the Prince made lowe obeiſance to his Maieſtie three times, and after the third time, when hee was come neere to the King, hee kneeled downe on a rich Pillow or Cuſhion, whileſt ſir Ralph Winwood principall Secretarie, read his Letters Patents: then his Maieſtie, at the reading of the words of Inueſtment, put the Robes vpon him, and girded on the Sword, inueſted him with the Rodde and Ring, and ſet the Cappe and Coronet on his head. With which Ceremonie the Creation being accompliſhed, the King aroſe, and went vp to Dinner; but the Prince, with his Lords, dined in the Hall, and was ſerued with great State and Magnificence, accompanied at his Table with diuers great Lords, as the Earle of Suffolke Lord Treaſurer, the Earle of Arundell Lord Marſhall, the Earle of Nottingham Lord Admirall, the Duke of Lenox Lord Steward, the Earle of Penbrooke Lord Chamberlaine, the Erles of Shrewſbury, Darby, Rutland, and Suſſex, the Prince ſitting in a Chaire at the vpper end, and the reſt in diſtance about foure yards from him, one oueragainſt another, in their degrees, all which were thoſe that were employed in ſeuerall Offices of Honour about his Royall Creation.
               
                  At another Table in the ſame Rowme on the left hand of the Prince, ſate the Knights of the Bath, all on one ſide, and had likewiſe great ſeruice and attendance. About the middeſt of Dinner, ſir William Segar Knight, aliâs Garter, principall King of Armes, with the reſt of the Kings Heralds and Purſuvants of Armes, approached the Princes Table, and with a lowde and audible voyce, proclaimed the Kings Stile, in Latine, French and Engliſh thriee; and the Princes in like manner, twice: then the Trumpets ſounding, the ſecond Courſe came in; and Dinner done, that dayes Solemnitie ceaſed.

               Hauing thus briefly deſcribed the manner of his Highneſſe Creation, with the honourable Seruice ſhewne to the Solemnitie, both by the Lords and Gentlemen of the Innes of Court, I ſhould haue ſet a Period, but that the Knights of the Bath, being a principall part and ornament of this ſacred Triumph, I can not paſſe them ouer without ſome remembrance: therefore thus much out of the Note of Directions, from ſome of the principall Officers of Armos, and ſome obſeruation of credite, concerning the Order and Ceremonies of the Knighthood.
               The Lords and other that were to receiue the Honourable Order of the Bath, repayred on Satterday the ſecond of Nouember to the Parliament houſe at Weſtminſter, and there in the afternoone heard Euening Prayer, obſeruing no other Ceremonie at that time, but onely the Heralds going before them in their ordinarie habites from thence to King Henrie the ſeauenths Chappell at Weſtminſter, there to beginne their warrefare, as if they would employ their ſeruice for God eſpecially; from whence, after

Seruice ended, they returned into the Chamber they were to ſuppe in: their ſupper was prepared all at one Table, and all ſate vpon one ſide of the ſame, euery mā hauing an Eſcutcheon of his Armes placed ouer his head, and certaine of the Kings Officers being appoynted to attend them. In this manner hauing taken their repaſt, ſeuerall beds were made ready for their lodging in another rowme hard by, after the ſame manner, all on one ſide; their beddes were Pallats, with Couerings, Teſters, or Canopies of Red Say, but they vſed no Curtaines.
               The Knights in the meane while were withdrawne into the Bathing Chamber, which was the next rowme to that which they ſupped in; where, for each of them was prouided a ſeuerall bathing Tubbe, which was lined both within and without, with white Linnen, and couered with Red Say: wherein, after they haue ſaid their prayers, and commended themſelues to God, they bathe themſelues, that thereby they might be put in minde, to be pure in bodie and ſoule from thenceforth; and after the Bath, they betooke themſelues to their reſt.
               Earely the next morning they were awakened with Muſicke, and at their vpriſing, inueſted in their Hermites habites, which was a Gowne of Gray Cloth girded cloſe, and a Hoode of the ſame, and a linnen Coife vnderneath, and an Hankercher hanging at his girdle, cloth Stockings ſoaled with Leather, but no Shooes; and

thus apparelled, their Eſquiers Gouernors, with the Heralds wearing the Coates of Armes, and ſundry ſorts of winde-Inſtruments before them, they proceede from their lodging, the meaneſt in order formoſt, as the nighr before, vntill they came to the Chappell, where after Seruice ended, their Oath was miniſtred vnto them by the Earle of Arundell Lord Marſhall, and the Earle of Penbroke Lord Chamberlaine, in a ſolemne and ceremonious manner, all of them ſtanding foorth before their ſtalles, and at their coming out making low reuerence towards the Altar, by which the Commiſſioners ſate, then were they brought vp by the Heralds by two at once, the chiefeſt firſt, and ſo the reſt, till all ſucceſſiuely had receiued their Oath, which in effect was this; That aboue all things they ſhould ſeek the honour of God, and maintenance of true Religion, loue their Soueraigne, ſerue their Countrie, helpe Maydens, Widdowes, and Orphans, and (to the vtmoſt of their power) cauſe Equity and Iuſtice to be obſerued.
               This day, whileſt they were yet in the Chappell, wine and ſweet meates were brought them, and they departed to their Chamber to be diſrobed of their Hermites weedes, and were reueſted in Roabes of Crimſon Taffata, implying they ſhould be Martiall men, the Robes lined with white Sarcenet, in token of Sincerity, hauing white Hattes on their heads, with white Feathers, white Bootes on their legges, and

white Gloues tied vnto the ſtrings of their Mantles: all which performed, they mount on horſebacke, the Saddle of blacke leather, the Arſon white, Stirrop leathers blacke, gilt, the pectorall of blacke leather, with a croſſe Paty of Siluer thereon, and without a Crupper, the Bridle likewiſe blacke, with a croſſe Paty on the Forehead or Frontlet: each Knight betweene his two Eſquiers well apparrelled, his Footeman attending, and his Page riding before him, carrying his Sword with the hiltes vpward, in a white leather Belt without Buckles or Studdes, and his Spurres hanging thereon.
               In this order ranked, euery man according to his degree, the beſt or chiefeſt firſt, they rode faire and ſoftly towards the Court, the Trumpets ſounding, and the Heralds all the way riding before them being come to the Kings hall, the Marſhall meetes them, who is to haue their horſes, or elſe 100. s. in money for his Fee: then conducted by the Heralds, and others appoynted for that purpoſe, his Maieſtie ſitting vnder his Cloth of Eſtate, gaue to them their Knighthood in this manner:
               Firſt, the principall Lord that is to receiue the Order, comes, led by his two Eſquiers, and his Page before him, bearing his Sword and Spurs, and kneeleth downe before his Maieſtie, the Lord Chamberlain takes the Sword of the page, and deliuers it to the King, who puts the Belt ouer the necke of the Knight, aſlope his breaſt,

placing the Sword vnder his left Arme: the ſecond Nobleman of the chiefe about the King, puts on his Spurres, the right Spurre firſt; and ſo is the ceremony performed. In this ſort Lord Maltreuers ſonne and heire to the Erle of Arundell, Lord Marſhall, which was the principall of this number, being firſt created, the reſt were all conſequently knighted alike: And when the ſolemnitie thereof was fully finiſhed, they all returned in order as they came, ſauing ſome ſmall difference, in that the yongeſt or meaneſt knight went now formoſt, & their Pages behinde them.
               Coming backe to the Parliament houſe, their dinner was ready prepared in the ſame rowme, and after the faſhion as their ſupper was the night before; but being ſet, they were notto taſte of any thing that ſtood before them, but with a modeſt carriage, and gracefull abſtinence, to refraine: diuers kindes of ſweet Muſicke ſounding the while; and after a conuenient time of ſitting, to ariſe, and withdraw themſelues, leauing the Table ſo furniſhed to their Eſquiers and Pages.
               About fiue of the clocke in the afternoone, they rode againe to Court, to heare Seruice in the Kings Chappell, keeping the ſame order they did at their returne from thence in the morning, euery Knight riding betweene his two Eſquiers, and his Page following him.
               At their entrance into the Chappell, the Heralds conducting them, they make a ſolemne reuerence,

the yongeſt Knight beginning, the reſt orderly enſuing, and ſo one after another take their ſtanding before their Stalls, where all being placed, the eldeſt Knight maketh a ſecond Reuerence, which is followed to the yongeſt, and then all aſcend into their Stalls, and take their accuſtomed places.
               Seruice then beginneth, and is very ſolemnly celebrated with ſinging of diuers Anthemes to the Organs, And when the Time of their Offertorie is come, the yongeſt Knights are ſummoned forth of their Stalls by the Heralds, doing reuerence firſt within their Stalls, and againe after they are diſcended, which is likewiſe imitated by all the reſt; and being all thus come forth, ſtanding before their Stalls as at firſt, the two eldeſt Knights with their ſwords in their hands, are brought vp by the Heralds to the Altar, where they offer their ſwords, and the Deane receiues them, of whom they preſently redeeme them with an Angell in Gold, and then come downe to their former places, whilſt two other are led vp in like manner: The ceremonie performed, and ſeruice ended, they depart againe in ſuch order as they came, with accuſtomed Reuerence; At the Chappell doore as they came forth, they were encountred by the Kings Maiſter Cooke, who ſtood there with his white Apron & Sleeues, and a chopping knife in his hand, and challenged their Spurres, which were likewiſe redeemed with a Noble in money, threatning

them neuertheleſſe, that if they proued not true and loyall to the King his Lord and Maiſter, it muſt be his Office to hew them from their heeles. On Monday morning they all met together nigh at the Court, where in a priuate Roome appointed for them, they were cloathed in long Robes of Purple Sattin, with Hoods of the ſame, all lined and edged about with white Taffata: And thus appareled, they gaue their attendance vpon the Prince at his creation, & dined that day in his preſence at a ſide Boord, as is already declared.
