            To the Right worſhipful Maſter
Iuſtice Meade, returning from his
Honorable circuite, IOHN HARVEY
wiſheth long health, and continuall increaſe
of all prosperitie.
            
               MAy it pleaſe you
Right worſhipfull
Sir, after ſome reſpite
from ſo great
buſineſſe, as your
Honorable circuit
carrieth with it, to
accept fauourablie
of the affectionate
minde of a yong ſcholler, I will preſume in
ſtead of the beſt well-come-home, that my
poore ſtudy can preſently afoord, to preſent
your good woorſhip with a briefe Aſtrologicall
exerciſe, which I lately vndertoke
vppon this occaſion. Hauing ſundry
times peruſed the Aſtrologicall diſcourſe
touching the great Coniunction of Saturne &
Iupiter, publiſhed the laſte Ianuary by my
brother Richard, and therein noting by
the way ſome wante of certaine neceſſarie 
                  〈◊〉
               
profitable Iudicials, which ſeemed con
               
                  ••
               nient
to be added for the more expres
and particular diſcuſsing of ſome pointes▪
               
generally, and that diligently too, by him
conſidered, but not ſo narrowly, and preciſely
examined, as they might haue been,
(which was not my opinion only, but the
iudgement of ſome his learned welwillers,
and great commenders otherwiſe) I reſolued
in the end to eaſe him of that labour,
knowing himſelfe to bee otherwiſe buſied
vpon more ſpecial and neceſſary occaſion.
Which I was the more willing to enterprize,
for theſe foure cauſes. Firſt, to ſatisfie
the demaunds and deſires of thoſe his lerned
friendes: then, to ſtoppe the mouthes
of his enuious & carping enemies: thirdly,
to benefit ſuch of our Coūtrey generally,
as by prouidence are deſirous to worke
their owne commoditie and ſafetie: and
laſt of all, to practiſe my ſelfe particularlie
in ſuch an exerciſe, as was ſo profitable for
an Vniuerſitie man, ſo conuenient for a
Student in Philoſophy, & the Mathematicks,
and finally, ſo agreeable to that ſtudie and
profeſsion, whereunto partly by my naturall
diſpoſition I was inclyned, and partly
vpon farther aduiſe of my friendes, and
ſome priuate conſultation of mine owne, I
had wholy betaken, and as it were betroathed
my ſelfe. Beſides which cauſes, the
verie worthines and dignitie of the Arte it
ſelfe, not only in reſpect of the high and

heauenly matter, or obiect thereof, according
to the diuine verſes of Doctor
Antony Myzaldus.
            
               Semine caeleſti ſatamens, caeleſtia quaerit
               Semina. And ſo foorth;
               
            
            But alſo, euen for the other three
Logike cauſes, the efficient, the forme,
and the end or finall cauſe; might as
wel commend this exerciſe vnto me, as it
hath done many the like, nay many for all
excellencie both of qualitie and quantitie,
farre vnlike vnto other manner of men,
then I either preſently am, or am euer
like to be. For the firſt author and principall
efficient, what enemie to Aſtrologie
can deny, but God him ſelfe, poſuit duo magna
luminaria, & ſtellas in firmamento caeli, as
Moyſes writeth in the beginning of Geneſis:
Why? vt diuiderent diem, ac noctem, & eſſent
in ſigna, & tempora, & dies, & annos. In quae
ſigna? nimirum in ſigna naturalium euentuum, vt
futurae peſtilentiae, belli, & pacis, penuriae, & abundantiae,
caeterorúmque ſimilium phyſicorum effectuum,
as a learned wryter very well in my
ſimple iudgement expoundeth that place
of Moyſes. Beſides, who knoweth not
that all good giftes, and all good artes descend
from aboue, and had their originall
from the father of light? Whereupon Melancthon
               
in his preface to Purbachius, his Aſtrologicae
Theoricae, not only concludeth generally
of all liberall Artes, Cum Artes Dei
munus ſint, non defuturus eſt Deus his, qui ipſius
dona tuentur, & conſeruare ſtudent: with this
comfortable addition: Erunt & fatae ipſa aliquando
Artibus aequiora: but alſo particularlie
inueigheth againſt all ſuch Epicures,
and contemners, as ſet them ſelues againſt
the moſt heauenly and diuine knowledge
of Aſtrologie. In which Inuectiue, he is ſo
earneſtly bent againſt them, that he breaketh
foorth into theſe vehement ſpeeches.
Epicureos illos, qui neque pulcherrimos motus caeleſtium
corporum admirantur, neque cognitionem
eorum vtilem eſſe contendunt, ne hominum quidem
appellatione dignos eſſe iudico. His reaſon
is. Etenim non ſolum bellum gerunt cum humana
natura, quae praecipue ad has diuinas res aſpiciendas
condita eſt, ſed etiam 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               ſunt. Voluit
enim Deus horum mirabilium Curſuum, ac caeleſtium
virium notitiam, ducem nobis eſſe ad diuinitatis
cognitionem. And againe ſhortlie
after he addeth: Haec ſi quis arroganter conteninit,
naturae ſuae immanitatem prodit, non aliter
atque Cyclops apud Homerum, qui negat ſe
vllos vereri Deos. So that Melancthon, is
not afraide to condemne them euen for
Epicures, and Atheiſtes, that condemne
this moſt goodly and godly Science. And

as for our ſecundarie Authors and founders,
what two more famous Princes amongſt
the auncient Aegyptians, and Romanes,
then Hermes Triſmegiſtus, and Numa
Pompilius? Or what two more excellent
kinges amongſt the later Aegyptians
and Aragonians, then Ptolomey, and Alphonſus?
The reſt for breuitie I ouerpaſſe,
ſauing that I muſt not omitte the poets
honorable teſtimonie, as well of them, as
of the forenamed:

                  Faelices animae, quibus haec cognoſcere primum,
                  Inque domos ſuperas ſcandere cura fuit.
                  Credibile eſt illos pariter vitijſque, iociſque
                  Altius humanis exeruiſſe Caput.
               
            
            And ſo forward, till at laſt, he geueth
them this marueylous commendation, taken
from their marueylous effectes:

                  Admouere oculis diſtantia ſydera noſtris,
                  Aethera
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ingenio ſuppoſuere ſuo.
               
            
            Now if we conſider either the internall
forme of the Arte it ſelfe, or the externall
forme of our cheefeſt Artificers:
can it be gaineſaide, but the one is heauenlie,
like the matter: the other, eſpeciallie,
in the Greeke and Latin toungs,
as diſtinct and Methodicall, as was to be
found in any Philoſopher, or Mathematician
               
of the ſame ages? And nowe of late Adolphus
Scribonius of Marpurgh in Germanie,
in his ſmall Tractate, intituled Iſagoge Sphaerica,
hath ſomewhat reformed the Artificiall
maner and order of our more auncient
Aſtrologers, according to the exact
and exquiſite rules of Ramus methode,
howbeit he doeth not ſo farre go beyond
them in maner, but he commeth as farre
behind them in matter: as euery learned
Aſtrologer muſt needes confeſſe. Laſt of
all, touching the end, or finall cauſe of
Aſtrologie, he can do very little, God wot,
that is not able to mainteine the ende
thereof to be partly diuine, and common
with other Artes, partly humane, and proper
vnto it ſelfe. The diuine or common
ende, is the glorie of God; the humane,
or proper ende, to do good in the world,
by ſuch predictions, and diuinations, as
the principles and rules of this Art truly
deliuered, and rightly vnderſtoode, doo
afford: firſt, in forewarning what euils
and miſchiefes are like to enſue: and then
in foretelling, what goods and commodities
may be reaped by timely prouiſion:
for the better auoiding of the one by preuention,
and the more certeine enioying
of the other by forecaſt: according to
thoſe notable verſes of the learned Poet:
               
               
                  Illic Aſtra, polos, caelum, ſeptem
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      planetas
                  Conſulit Aſtrologus: terriſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      reportat eorum
                  Concilium, hinc armans illas, firmanſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      caducae
                  Contra caeleſtes Iras, Superum
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      furorem.
               
Which finall end, togither with the other
three reaſonable, and logike cauſes, beeing
reaſonablie and logikelie conſidered,
I can not ſee howe the worthines or dignitie
of this Arte, can any way be impeached,
without great indignitie offered
therevnto. Vpon indifferent examination
of which cauſes, whereby he principally
meaſureth the worthines or vnworthines
of euery good or bad thing, my brother
Gabriel, was much the better content, as
he hath him ſelfe confeſſed, that both my
brother Richard and I ſhould take theſe
paines in Iudiciarie Aſtrologie, which otherwiſe
he had rather we ſhould haue beſtowed
vpon the more popular and ordinarie
ſtudies of the right morall and naturall
Philoſophie, Arithmetike, Geometrie, and
Coſmographie, with the firſt principles, and
moſt neceſſarie precepts of Aſtronomie, ſo
farre as fetting their grounds from infallible
experience, they extende but to the
obſeruation of the place, magnitude, and
motion of euery ſtarre, with their whole
number, as partly by Geometricall menſuration,
and partly by Arithmeticall ſupputation,

both ſeuerally & iointly they haue
beene deſcried, to the altitude or depreſsion
of ech of them, whoſe farneſſe &
neerenes either vnto vs, or amongſt them
ſelues, is ſo exactly determinable by the
vſe of the Aſtrolabe, either Quadrant, as
Ptolomeis was, or orbicular, as ours now vſeth
to be: to the deſcription, & determination
of times, which auaileth ſo much, aſwell to
the exerciſe of Husbandrie, as to diuers
other expedient and neceſſary vſes: to the
ſituation of places, in declaring the longitude,
latitude, and diſtance of euery place,
which is ſo great an helpe in Coſmographie,
and ſo ſpecially needefull for direction in
Hydographie or Nauigation, being otherwiſe
deſtitute of all certentie in the middeſt of
ſo many and huge ieopardies: or finally to
the intimation of any ſuch meere Aſtronomicall
experiments, without mixture of
any Iudicials, either Arabian, or other, pretending
any prediction of things to come,
or diſcouerie of hidden & ſecret matters.
So that conſidering the premiſſes, and
therevnto referring that moſt notable
iudgement of Melancton, vpon Ptolomeis
Magna Syntaxis, where he ſaith: Explodenda
eſt illa Epicurea Philoſophia, quae tollit finales
ſtellarum cauſſas, & affirmat earum omnes naturas
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : & ſi ſint finales cauſſae caeterarum

rerum, cur non dicemus etiam eſſe pulcherrimorum
corporum, & perpetuarum Motuum?
Certitudo in motu, artem opiſicis indicat;
Ars conſilium, ac cauſam finalem neceſſariò complectitur:
vnde & ſtellae haud dubiè ſuos habent
tum effectus, tum ſignificationes in elementis, &
in ijs, quae inde gignuntur: vt manifeſta experientia,
& omnibus ſaeculis conſentiens, teſtatur
congreſſus ſiccorum ſyderum magnas ſiccitates,
humidorum, humidas tempeſtates efficere: and
ſo foorth, till he proceedeth thus farre:
At caeleſtes hae ſignificationes non modo magnas
mutationes tempeſtatum, ſed etiam ciuilium rerum
denunciant; vt oſtendunt euentus, qui
comitantur Eclypſes, & magnas Planetarum
coniunctiones: nec illa ſigna vllo modo pugnant
cum religione, cum Deus ea & propoſuerit, &
gubernet. For theſe (I ſay) and the like effectuall
conſiderations, my brother Gabriel,
beeing of him ſelfe otherwiſe affected,
hath not diſliked either of my brother
Richards, or of my exerciſe in this
kinde. Wherevppon as he at the length
was the boulder to dedicate his Aſtrologicall
Diſcourſe vnto my Lorde the Biſhop
of London, who accepted moſt fauourablie
and curteouſlie thereof; ſo
am I alſo the rather encouraged to direct
this my ſmall Treatiſe folowing, beeing
a ſupplement of the ſaide Diſcourſe,

vnto your good worſhip, who I hope will
likewiſe vouchſafe it either the ſame, or
the like fauourable acceptation. Neither
durſt he then, or I now, haue preſumed
vpon any ſuch dedication vnto ſuch perſonages,
but after good aduice and deliberation,
as well touching the premiſſes ſpecially,
as generally touching the more ample
auouchment of the whole Arte, being
ſkilfully handled, diſcreetly ordered, and
lawfully practiſed, as it ought to be: which
being more fully and perſwaſiblie proſequuted
by my brother Richard in his ſecond
Diſcourſe, entreating of Februarie
Newes, and by the way defending both the
right Iudicials of Aſtrologie, in genere, and his
owne particular Iudicials concerning the
effects of this great April cōiunction, in ſpecie:
I hope there ſhall not here neede anie
farther Apologie either of his fact, or mine:
Conſidering withal, what good and effectuall
cauſes moued vs, as well to the vndertaking
of the priuate exerciſe, as to the
aduenturing of the publique Dedication
vnder the names of ſo graue, and ſo well
reputed perſonages, for their calling and
wiſdome. For my ſelfe, I am to adde,
that not only the right worſhipful eſtimation
and account of your name, and honorable
Commonwelth vertues (which

notwithſtanding are of ſo great reputation
here in Eſſex, where my moſt abode
ſince Michaeſmas laſt, vpon ſome occaſion
hath been) hath cauſed me to preſent
this Aſtrological Treatiſe, together with my
Tranſlation of Hermes moſt famous Iatromathematica
vnto your good worſhip, but
alſo certaine other reſpectes, no leſſe effectuall.
If I had been ignorant before, yet
ſince my late continuaunce here, I coulde
not but learne how ſingular account you
make of all good learning, what eſpeciall
great fauour you extend towards the ſtudious
and learned; and laſtly, how ready
and deſirous you are to defend and maintaine
both the one and the other, eyther
by priuate, or publicke patronage. Which
very affection of yours, ſo euidently declared
by ſo many actuall ſignifications therof,
might of it ſelfe, without farther reaſon,
ſufficiently encourage me vnto this dedication.
But I cannot forgette my Brother
Gabriels report of the bountifull and
courteous entertainment which it pleaſed
you aboue three yeeres ſince to geue vnto
him, and the Oxforde Preacher, his Companion
at that time, being both but ſtrangers
vnto you. Which entertainment I
heard him both then, and ſince, much cō
               mende,
as well for your worſhipfull and

rare courteſie, extended towardes them,
partly by familiar diſcourſe vpon ſome
chiefe pointes of learning, and partly by
manifeſt declaration of your good liking,
& welwiſhing otherwiſe, as for the greatnes
of the cheare, choiſe of the companie,
manner of welcome, and ſuch like. Which
he ſaide could not chooſe but proceede of
a liberall, and worſhipfull minde, of the
wiſer, and learneder ſort: as no doubt it
did. Beſide this, I haue lately heard it
credibly reported here in Walden, that
your good worſhippe ſhould like very wel,
and commend of my brother Richards Aſtrologicall
Diſcourſe, with farther mention,
not only of my brother Gabriel, to his
eſpeciall commendation and credit, but euen
of my poore ſelfe too. All which cauſes,
and reaſons concurring, as they doo,
how much were I to be blamed, if I
ſhould make any other choiſe for this my
firſt Dedication, then of your good worſhippe?
To whom my onely ſuite, and
humble requeſt is, that it may pleaſe you
to accept fauourablie of ſo ſmal a teſtimonie
of my duetifull good will, and heartie
affection, vntill God ſhall enhable me to
make ſome reaſonable amends with ſome
other of greater ſhewe, and more importance.
Which I truſt wil not be long, if my

ſtudie in the Mathematikes and Phyſike,
may haue that ſucceſſe, which I hope in
God it ſhall. In the meane time, preſuming
in ſome part, of your wonted goodneſſe,
and fauour, and crauing pardon in
the reſt, I moſt humblie commend your
worſhippe to almightie God. This firſt
of Aprill. 1583.

to adde vnto his Aſtrological Diſconrſe,
what I (vpō ſome cōference) thought,
might reaſonablie be demaunded, as therein
requiſite. My meaning is not to perfect Apelles
picture, or to teach him, of whom I may
learne: but to doe as much for him in his
wante of leyſure (ſo farre as my reading will
extend) as I would wiſh him to doe for me
vpon like occaſion. Whereunto I was the
readier, in reſpect of that vſe and fruite that I
might priuately reape of ſo ſchollarlie and philoſophicall
an exerciſe. Which agreeing, as it
doth with that finall profeſſion, which I haue
already after ſome deliberation, made choiſe
of, cannot (I conceiue) but be a very profitable

and auailable exerciſe for me. It is no great
matter that my yeares can yet affoorde: I eaſily
graunt, (notwithſtanding more reading
in the Mathematicks, and eſpecially in Aſtrologie,
then euery one knoweth of, that as
the Poet ſaith, Adhuc mea meſsis in herba
eſt. But as my ſpring beginneth now with
the Spring, ſo I hope by Gods grace, to ſee
the harueſt, that ſhall yeald and bring forth
my harueſt. If I procead not, the fault is only
mine own: if I ſuccead, I muſt be thankfull
firſt vnto God, & then vnto thoſe, whom
it hath pleaſed him to make my founders, and
chieflie your ſelfe. But that I may the better
proceede, and ſucceed, as well in this briefe
Treatiſe now, as hereafter in my other larger
exerciſes, I am taught of our great Arabian
Aſtrologers, to begin, go forwarde, and
end, with God: aſſuring my ſelf of the vndouted
certaintie of the auncient Greeke verſe:

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               .
            Which being my principal & final ground,
I doubt not but I may as ſafely, and lawfully
exerciſe my ſelfe in the practiſe of this ſtudie,
as of any other liberall Arte. Howſoeuer
ſome through ignoraunce, and ſome through
other ſiniſter cauſes conceiue amiſſe thereof:
contrarie to Saynt Ambroſe, Theodoretus,
the famous auncient biſhop Thomas
Aquinas, Ioannes Hiſpalenſis, ſometime

a reuerend biſhopp in Spaine, Lucas
Gauricus, a learned Italian biſhop, Ioannes
Ganiuetus, Michael a Petra ſancta, & Franciſcus
Iunctinus, Doctors of diuinitie, with
diuers other of like grauitie and reputation,
who haue been great fauourers, and practiſers
of the ſame, wel and orderly vſed. I would
to God I were but worthie to carrye the
bookes of ſome, that haue trauailed this way:
and namely of thoſe, whome my brother Richard
namely commendeth for their ſingular
ſkil, and paines taking in this facultie. Vnto
whom I may trulie adde, Septimius Seuerus,
Veſpaſianus, Hadrianus, Athelſtane,
a noble king of England, whoſe Aſtrological
worke, as you do beſt remember, is mentioned
by Ramus in his Scholae Mathematicae;
Leopoldus Auſtriacus, Laurentius de
Medicis, & certaine other moſt worthy Emperors,
Kings, and Princes; to let paſſe Hermes
Triſmegiſtus, Numa Pompilius, Bladud,
one of our firſt Britiſh Kinges, and ſuch
other of greateſt auncientie. Neither can I
muſe and maruell inough, that any learned
Diuines ſhould bande againſt the right vſe of
Aſtrologie: conſidering what my brother
hath alleadged, ſpecially out of Melancthon.
Whereunto may be adioyned that notable
iudgement and autoritie of Dauid Chitraeus,
deliuered by him in a Treatiſe of his, intituled,

De ſtudio Theologiae rectè inchoando:
where Chitraeus wordes are verbatim
theſe: Arithmaticae, & Aſtronomiae cognitio,
in Eccleſia, ad doctrinae de Anno, &
Calendarii conſeruationem, neceſſaria eſt.
Non enim initio mundi, non Exordia, &
propagatio Eccleſiae, non ſeries diuinarum
patefactionum, non or do Imperiorū,
non tempora aduentus Chriſti in carnem,
& ad iudicium, non tempora quibus praecipui
doctores Eccleſiae vixerunt, & maximae
res in Eccleſia geſtae ſunt, non ratio celebrandi
Paſchatis Iudaici, non magnitudo
miraculi, quo Sol patiente Chriſto obſcuratus
eſt, non talia multa cogitari & intelligi,
ſine numeratione Annorum, & initijs
doctrinae Aſtronomicae poſſunt. A ſufficient
reaſon, a man would thinke: which neuertheleſſe
he alſo confirmeth, and ratifyeth,
firſt diuino, and then, humano teſtimonio,
after this maner: Ideo Deus ipſe in prima
ſtatim ſacrae Scripturae pagina, iubet nos
ſpacia motuum Solis, & Lunae, qui dierum,
menſium, & annorum metas conſtituunt,
& maximè omnium illuſtria Dei, & prouidentiae
diuinae ſigna ſunt, obſeruare. Vere
enim, vt Plato ait, gratiſsima, & omnium
dulciſsima de Deo fama, in aſtris, & doctrina
aſtrorum ſparſa eſt. In conſideration of
which reſpects, the forenamed Iohannes Hiſpalenſis

               in his prologe to Albumazar the Arabian,
interpreteth him ſelfe and other Aſtrologers
thus. Cum dicimus Planetam aliquem,
malum futurum praeſignare, nihil aliud
ſentimus, niſi quod ſui Creatoris mandato
vt creaturae inſeruientes, eius praeſcientiam
imitando hominem ipſum malum
nobis oſtendunt. To which effect alſo, the
foreſaid Ioannes Ganiuetus, in the ſeuenth
chapter of his fourth Difference, determineth
in theſe wordes: Culpando planetarum ſignificata,
etiam pro certo diuinam ſtatim
culpamus prouidentiam. Nihil enim aliud
planetae, quàm quod Deus praeuiderit, aut
praedeſtinauerit, ſignificant. Which is likewiſe
confirmed by Ioannes Picus Mirandula,
in the firſt booke and ſecond chapter of his
Heptaplus, in following theſe two autenticall▪
Maximes: Nihil agunt cauſae naturales,
quod non diuinae Artis ordo praeceperit.
And, Omne opus Naturae, eſt opus intelligentiae.
Whereof the firſt he alleadgeth as a
ſound principle of the diuine Platoniſtes; the
ſecond, as a common Rule of the Perepatecians,
both theron grounding a diſtinction of
cauſes, the one exemplaris in God him ſelfe,
the other organica, in his Inſtrumentes and
creatures. Which conſiderations being preſuppoſed
as they ought, and laid down for our
very firſt and principall foundations, let me

ſee, I ſay not what Diume, but what diuinitie
maketh againſt vs? eſpecially if withall
the autoritie of Gemma Friſius may be takē,
who in his Preface to Stadius Ephemerides,
auoucheth this Arte to be ſo certainlie
true, and infallible, that he is not afeard to attribute
euen, verā & neceſſariam 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
               thereunto. To which purpoſe I could likewiſe
apply diuers other as credible teſtimonies,
& namely of the forenamed Michael a
Petra ſancta, Iouianus Pontanus, Iacobus
Gohōhemes Oſtofrancus, and Lucius Bellantius
Senenſis. But the legitimation of
liberall ſciences, and as wel of this, as of any
other, is to be auowed rather by the generall
practiſe of all ages, then by any ſuch particular
proofe: and therfore hauing as wel herein,
as in the whole courſe of the Tractate following,
added ſomething to my brothers diſcourſe,
I will forthwith proceede to the like
Supplement of the entire matter it ſelfe: requeſting
therein the ſame fauourable patience,
which you extended to his larger Diſcourſe.
I muſt craue pardon for the forme
and ſtile, wherwith I am not yet ſufficiently
acquainted. If the matter only be anſwerable
to your expectation, I ſhall thinke my labor
well beſtowed. But howſoeuer it falleth
out, I hope, In rebus magnis ſit voluiſſe
ſatis, will reaſonablie ſerue for my purgation.

Better a common excuſe then none at all.
Thus preſuming the beſt, I am bould to offer
you the Aſtrologicall Treatiſe following:

to pleaſe you, and pleaſure other therewith.

               The order of the Planets, as they are either
ſtrong, or weake; more familiarly expreſſed
for the common capacitie of the
vnſkilfuller ſorte.
               
                  BY this diſtribution, or Table
may eaſily be gathered
what Planets are ſtrongly
ſituated in the prefixed
figure of the Heauens: as
alſo what Planets are féeble
and weak in the ſame.
Now it followeth that wée lykewiſe conferre
them amongſt themſelues, accordinge to the
true and exact number of their Fortitudes &
Debilities, that it may yet more manifeſtly
and ſenſibly appear which of them are moſt
ſtronge and fortunate, and which againe moſt
weake and infortunate, and how one as it
were lineally ſuccéedeth another in ſtrength
and power.
               Firſt the amiable Planet Venus amongſt
all the other Planets is ſimply moſt ſtronge
and fortunate in the former celeſtiall ſcheme:
For if the number of her debilities be ſubtrated
from the ſumme of her fortitudes, there
till remayne 13. teſtimonies of ſtrength,
which no other Planet obtayneth in this Figure.
Notwithſtandinge ſhée is ſomewhat
weakened by certaine other accidentall Debilities,
                  
then are yet named: for ſhe is aſſociated
with the Dragons tayle, which as
Guido Bonatus well teſtifieth, Cum bonis
mala eſt, & boni bonitatem minuit. Alſo
not paſſing two houres before ſhe was oppoſite
to the Moone, ex Diametro, béeing ſituated
in quarta coeli maſculina, ſuper terram
in die. Beſide that, in ſigno maſculino,
contrarie to her owne proper nature. And
laſtly, Septentrionalis Aſcendens, which do
all ſomewhat aſſuage and abate her courage:
wherefore her ſignifications can not be altogither
ſo fortunate and effectual, as otherwiſe
they might, and would haue béen.
               2 Then the two ſuperior Planets conioyned
Saturne and Iupiter ſuccéeds, which are
both very ſtrong and valerous in compariſon
of their debilities, becauſe their fortitudes
are not only equiualent: but euen as many
mo in nūber as their debilities. For Saturns
teſtimonies of ſtrength are 18. his debilities
but 9. So likewiſe are the fortitudes of Iupiter
18. his debilities but 9. Wherefore Saturne
and Iupiter ſéeme equally matched in
power and ſtrength: but in reſpect of Circumſtances,
I take Iupiter to be the ſtronger
of both, which being generallie taken, is a
good and laudable token, but particularlie
diſcuſſed, not ſo good; as ſhall more plainly be
declared hereafter.
               
                  
3 Mercurie is next in ſtrength, although
in verie déed his ſtrength be rather weaknes,
then ſtrength, and little or nothing at all to
ſpeake of. For albeit his vertues are more
in number by two, then his debilities, yet he
is not ſo much exalted by thoſe two teſtimonies,
as he is depreſſed by his Aſcenſion in
Meridiem, by béeing, in ſigno mali planetae,
& in cadenti loco caeli, which on the
contrarie ſide, doo much increaſe his euill
influence, and make him more infortunate.
Nam ſicut ſignum turbat Domum, ita Domus
turbat ſignum, & ſignum Planetam.
An approued rule.
               4 Now as concerning Mars, Sol, and Luna,
they are very weake and infortunate in
the prefixed ſcheme, but eſpecially Sol: For
whereas the debilities of Luna are but a ſewe
moe, and the debilities of Mars ſcarſe halfe ſo
many mo as his fortitudes: the detrimentes
of the Sun are in number full as many mo as
his incremēts, which proportion muſt nedes
greatly increaſe and augment the ſtraunge
euents threatned by this corporall coniunction
of Saturne and Iupiter in the eighte
houſe.
               5 Finally, Pars Fortunae, that is, the
place of Heauen, wherein the rayes of the
Sunne and Moone doo concurre or méete,
is fortunately appoynted in this Figure,

being fortified with no leſſe then 16. vertues
Neuertheleſſe, Iupiter Dominus Domus Partis
Fortunae, being placed in domo magn
                        •
                     
infortunij, & etiam mortis, and there accompanied
with Infortunium Maius, dot
                     •
                  
ſomewhat decreaſe the good Fortune of Pars
Fortunae; And ſo much the rather, becauſe
Pars Fortunae it ſelf is ſituated in the 8. ſigne
although notwithſtandinge it bee reſidente it
the 7. houſe, yea & it is very nigh the cuſpis of
the 8. houſe too, for it wanteth but onely too
Degrées of the ſame.
               And thus much generally touching the
true conſtitution of the Planets, at that
Moment.
            
            
               Now to deſcend more particularly vnto the
preſent matter; The Dignities & Debilities
of Saturne & Iupiter, according to their
ſituation in the celeſtiall figure at the time of
their Coniunction, being already ſet downe;
that the true effectes and operations of their
méeting may the more manifeſtly appeare, it
followeth that wée conſider which of them is
eleuated and exalted aboue the other, at that
inſtant. For Ptolomey in his 63. verbo Centiloquij,
deliuereth this Maxime. Oportet
aſpicere in Coniunctione Saturni & Iouis in
eodem Minuto ad eleuationem vnius eorum
ſuper alterum, & iudica cum fortitudine

eius, ſcilicet eleuati in hoc mundo, &
ſimiliter fac in 20. reſiduis Cōiūctionibus.
Vpon which notable place of Ptolomey, his
Interpreter Albohazen Haly commenteth
thus: Eleuatio planetae ſuper planetam eſt,
vt ſit remotio ab Auge Circuli ſui breuis,
minor remotione alterius ab Auge Circuli
ſui breuis, & ille dicitur eleuatus ſuper alterum.
Where I gather that per remotionē
ab Auge, he vnderſtādeth their diſtance from
that poynt of their excētrick, which is fardeſt
diſtant from the Center of the earth. And
when he ſaith, parui circuli, he meaneth, as I
ſuppoſe, their ſeueral Epicicle, affirming ye he
which is neareſt the ſummitie of his Epicicle,
is eleuated aboue the other, which is farder remoued
from ye ſummity of his Epicicle. Marry
this muſt be found out & knowē, per vtriuſ

By which calculation I gather firſt, that
Saturne is deſcending in his Eccentrike, or
Deferent; becauſe his Centrum aequatum
                  
                     •
                  s, ab vno gradu in ſex ſigna; and that Iupiter
on the other ſide is Aſcending in his Eccentrike
or Deferent, becauſe his Centrum

                        •
                     equatum, is aboue ſixe ſignes. But forſomuch
as Argumentum aequatum Saturni
is nigher 0. grade, 0. minut, then Argumentū
equatū Iouis, (for when the Argumentum
equatū
                   of a planet is 0. G. 0. M. he is, in ſummitate
Epicicli) I take Saturne to be nigher
he ſummity of his Circle, & conſequently to
the eleuated aboue Iupiter, ſecundum Augē,
by reaſon of his proximitie to his Aux. Which
eleuation, according to the ancient principles
of Iudiciary Aſtrology, premonſtrateth the
violēt depreſſion, & gréeuous oppreſſon of the
Eccleſiaſtical Iouials by the force of temporal

                     •

                     n domo mortis, called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  idicials, I ſuppoſe that ye 
                  Iouials ſhal in the

end haue the better day, and triumph ouer the
Saturnmes, worthily by the iudgement of
the learned. But I define nothing morallie,
béeing only to ſuruey the naturall cauſes and
ſignes of naturall effects. Now forſomuch as
ſome Aſtrologians obſeruing and regarding
only the latitudes of the Planets at the time
of their Coniunction, make him to be eleuated
aboue the other, whoſe latitude is eyther
more Aſcentent in Septentrionem, or leſſe
Deſcendent verſus Meridiem, (as namelie
Ioannes Ganiuerus, who in his booke intituled,
Amicus Medicorum, the firſt chapter,
and third Difference, making mention of the
great Coniunction of Saturne and Iupiter
in the 13. grade of Scorpius, which hapned,
Anno, 1425. affirmeth that Saturne was
then eleuated aboue Iupiter) Why? becauſe,
as he there alledgeth, Maior fuit illius latitudo
verſus Septentrionē, therby gathering
and concluding, that much vnwonted trouble
and ſorrowe ſhould follow to the cleargie, and
ſo ſoorth. Now I ſay, for the diſcuſſing of that
interpretation, I will heere in like maner ſet
downe ſhe latitudes of the Planets from the
Eclyptike line towards the Poles of the Zodiaque
at the time of this Coniunction,
that it may therby likewiſe appeare, whether
Saturne be then alſo eleuated aboue Iupiter
according to his latitude.

                  Saturne therfore is deſcending from the Eclyptike
line towards the Antartike pole of
the Zodiake 1. grade, 20. Min. wheras Iupiter
is deſcending from the Eclyptike line towards
the Antartike pole of the Zodiake,
o. grade, 54. Min. Wherefore Iupiter on the
other ſide is eleuated aboue Saturne, ſecundum
latitudinem, bicauſe his latitude is leſſer
than Saturns is. For as when they are
both Septentrional Aſcendent, he is exalted
aboue the other, whoſe latitude is greateſt towards
the North, (as Ioannes Saxonius
teſtifieth in the end of his Commentary vpon
the fourth difference of Alcabitius his Iſagoge,
ad Magiſterium Iudiciorum Aſtrorum)
ſo on the contrary part, when they are
both Meridional Deſcendent (as now they
are) he muſt néeds be eleuated aboue the other,
whoſe latitude is leſſer towards ye ſouth.
So that according to this kind of eleuation,
ſecundum Latitudinem, the eccleſiaſticall or
ſpirituall power ſhould flouriſh and increaſe
more and more, and their eſtate become more

proſperous and fortunate, which is cleane
contrarie vnto the Aſtrologicall iudgement
before gathered, and drawen from the eleuation
of Saturne aboue Iupiter, ſecundum
Augem. More therfore now lieth the point of
the doubt, whether the eleuation of one Planet
aboue another, according to his Aux, or
according to his latitude, be moſt effectuall.
For the true concluſion, and determination
of the premiſſes, muſt be drawen from hence.
A matter of no ſmall difficultie to decide. For
mine owne part, touching the credit of Ioannes
Ganiuetus, although I ſhould liberally
graunt that he was, in ſacra Theologia, &
in ipſa Aſtrologia ſuo aeuo facilè princeps,
& ob eandem Aſtrologiam ab omnibus
ferè Chriſtianitatis, & Regibus, & Principibus,
nec non ab ipſo Pontifice Maximo,
haud paruis annuis ſtipendijs donatus; (as
Gondiſaluus Toledo, ſereniſsimae Francorum
Reginae Medicus, Lugdunenſiſ

                      pro

Antonius Toledo) yet am I rather to ſubſcribe
vnto the ſoueraigne iudgement and
authoritie of Ptolomey in theſe Aſtrologicall
poynts, eſpeciallie nowe in this, for two or
thrée notable conſiderations, and amongſt
the reſt, becauſe ſome other probable Arguments,
which may Aſtrologically be gathered
from the Figure erected for the time of

this Coniunction, ſéeme alſo to verifie the
ſame. For Mars, Lorde of the ninth houſe,
called ab adiuncto, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , placed in Domo
cadenti ab Angulo Medij Caeli, to wit, in
the 12. houſe, tearmed, Cacodaemon, â
ſignificatione triſtium euentuum (eſt enim
Domus, ſeu locus triſtitiae, aerumnarum,
maeroris, laborum, paupertatis, carceris,
occultorum inimicorum, impoſtorum,
meretricum, & ſuch like) ſignifieth the
impriſonment of ſome great Eccleſiaſticall
perſonage, of the nature of Mars, or Mercurie,
but becauſe the royall Planet Sol,
reſident in Corde Caeli, ſiue Regali Cuſpide,
called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is ſeparated from Mars
by a quartil radiation, it ſéemeth that there
ſhoulde ſome mercy be fauourablie pretended,
but not effectuallie performed. For
Mercurie, Lorde of the Horoſcope the
houſe of life, and alſo of the ſecond houſe
the houſe of ſubſtaunce, beeing withall infortunatelie
ſeated, in Domo cadenti ab
Angulo, to witte, in the ninth houſe (for
he is there peregrine, and deuoyde of all
his eſſentiall dignities) doth argue not onely
the vtter loſſe of his goods and ſubſtance,
but the depriuation of his life too, which is
alſo more manifeſtly ſignified by the Quartil
of Mercury with the Dragons head, in

violent ſignes, namely in Capricorne, and
Aries, nam hoc etiam capitis paenam minatur.
Wherefore great debate and much
diſſention is like to ariſe touching matters of
Eccleſiaſticall gouernement, and religious
controuerſies: whereby many ſhall be forciblie
diſpoſſeſſed: ſome vtterly vndone; not a
fewe vnmercifully ſlayne and murdered:
ſpecially in thoſe Regions and Cities, which
are vnder the regimēt of the third Quadrangle.
Wherwithall I am to obſerue, that Mars
is in Leone, and that the citie Mora is ſubiect
to the gouernment of this ſigne, conſidering
that it was Aſcendent in the Eaſt angle at
the laying of the firſt ſtone towards the foundation
thereof, as is generallie auouched, and
ſufficiently confirmed by the beſt Aſtrologers.
Ergo, Nunc caueat ſibi Mora, vel ſaltem alij
ab ea caueant, nè haec mora illis tandem
trahat periculum.
               
               Moreouer, Sol is in Tauro, the night houſe
of Venus, Venus is Lady of the tenth Cuſpis,
& ſoiourning in the 10. houſe, but placed
in the 11. ſigne, namely in Geminis, the
houſe of Mercury, there accompanied with
the Dragons tayle: Mercury him ſelfe is infortunately
appointed in the ninth houſe in
Ariete, and Mars Lord of Mercuries Manſiō
place is afflicted in the 12. houſe in Leone,
as is aforeſaid. All which circumſtances béeing

equally wayed, and diligently conſidered,
this concluſion I ſuppoſe may probably be inferred:
that the effects of Saturns eleuation aboue
Iupiter, ſecundū augem, are like to be
more effectuall at this inſtant, then the effects
of Iupiters eleuation aboue Saturne,
ſecundum latitudinem. Vincunt enim
ſemper plura teſtimonia, ſiue boni venturi,
ſiue mali illa fuerint, in praedictionibus Aſtrologicis.
The Iugemēt needeth no mans
countenance to geue it autority.
               Wherfore if I may freely vtter, that which
I Aſtrologically conceiue, I imagine that
ſome prophane helhound, ſome fierce and cruell
Antichriſt, ſome outragious and irreligious
Mahomet, ſome Turkiſh Martiall Tyrant
ſhall ariſe, who wil play the ſecond Athi
                     
                        •
                     a,
or Totilas, by ſcourging the zealous people
of God, who wil furiouſly aſſault the holy
citie of Ieruſalem, who wil violently oppreſſe
and horribly torment the Inhabitaunts of
that bleſſed Cittie. And ſhal not then Iniquitie
haue the vpper hande? Shall not then the
abhomination of deſolation ſtande in the ſacred
place? Shall not then ſorrowes by ſenſible
Addition and Multiplication, amount
to huge ſummes. But he that keepeth Iſrael,
ſhal neither ſlumber nor ſleepe: Neither dout
I, but the almightie and almerciful Adonay,
through his infinite power, and exceading

goodnes, wil cōfound this miſchieuous Helhound,
in his diueliſh Imaginations, and vtterly
deſtroy him in his ſpritiſh attempts, and
helliſh practiſes, to his owne ſmall ouerthrow
and confuſion: and to the ſingular comfort,
and vnſpeakable conſolation of true Chriſtians,
the only elect children and heires of God.

                  quution is like greeuouſly to
aſſault and inuade many Nations, and kingdomes,
before this generall peace and quyetneſſe
may be hoped, or looked for. Wherfore

then is the time that the Lord ſhal deliuer
Iſrael out of all her afflictions; euen then ſhal
we enioy perfect felicitie: and who ſo endureth

About the neceſſarie, or contingent veritie
whereof, much here might be added, but I haſten
to go forward with the reſt, beginning
where my brother Richard left, & for ſupplye
of his wants, adding thoſe iudgemēts, which
I haue collected ſince the 2. edition of his Aſtrological
diſcourſe, which could not be ſo
exactly & perfectly finiſhed by himſelfe, as otherwiſe
it might haue been, by reaſon of certaine
other impediments, which euen in the
midſt of that treatiſe, forcibly called him from
thoſe Mathematical and Philoſophical ſtudies.
It remayneth therfore, to note, that Saturne
Lord of ye 6. houſe, in Greek, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
ſo called, quod triſtia & aduerſa portendat,
(eſt enim domus aegritudinum, & vitiorum
corporis) premōſtrateth the dangerous, and
greeuous aſſaults of many Saturnine & Melancholike
diſeaſes; who becauſe in mans body
he ruleth and gouerneth the right eare, the
ſtomack, the ſplene, the bladder, the bones, and
teeth: he preſignifieth many cold diſeaſes proceeding
of ye defluxiō of humors to thoſe parts:
as namely the flux, ye dropſy, ye ptiſick, the collick,
ye ſtone in the raines & bladder, ye vehemēt
gnawing, or pain of the belly, ingēdred in the
ſmal guts, called Ilia, ye palſy, ye gout in ye féet, ye
tāker, ye black iaūdes, ſtiches in ye ſides like pluriſies,
black morphew, quartane agues; as alſo
cōtinual ache in ye ioints, pernitious catars,
roughs, rewmes, pooſes, hoarceneſſe, wheles, &

bliſters, ringwormes, running with drie
ſcabbes, and ytchings, byles, & vlcerations,
paſſions of the ſplene, the leaprie proceeding
of melancholy exceedingly, aduſt,
called comonly Elephantiaſis, beſide ſome
ſhrewde, and fore paines in the legs & feete:
together with ſome other mortal & peremptorie
diſeaſes, proceading partly of corrupt blud,
ryot, drunkennes, and ſurſet, partly of ſuperfluous,
rotten, and putrified humors, ſo long
continuing aud induring, that they ingender
Hecticke feuers, and conſumptions. For Saturne,
Dominus domus Infirmitatum,
reſident in domo mortis, doth plainly and
manifeſtly foreſhew the violence of ſome vncurable
and deadly ſickneſſes, which ſhall
greeuouſly afflict, and vehemently oppreſſe
many euen vnto death. Wherefore I would
wiſh thoſe, that feele themſelues diſeaſed, if ſo
be they deſire to be reſtored againe to their
wonted health, to ſeeke in due tyme for helps
and remedie at the hands of the learned and
expert Phiſition, before the infirmitie be fully
growen, and throughly rooted. It is too late
they ſay, to ſpare when all is ſpent and conſumed,
too late to ſhut the cage, when the byrde
is flowen out, too late to bar the ſtable doore,
whē the Steede is ſtollen away: And is it not
to too late to require remedie for a diſeaſe
already confirmed? what learned Chirurgian
                  
an will take in hand to cure a mortal and vncurable
vlcer? or what wiſe Phiſician will
vndertake to reſtore that Patient to health,
which is depryued of his ſenſes, ſpeach, reſpiration,
and mouing, through the violence and
importunitie of the ſtrong and vehement Apoplexy?
which cannot poſſiblie be reſiſted,
as Hippocrates witneſſeth in the 42. Aphoriſme
of his ſecond booke. Alſo the Leapry,
called Elephantiaſis, if it be eſtabliſhed and
confirmed, is by nature, an immedicable,
and deadly diſeaſe, which notwithſtanding, if
it be looked to in time, may be cured by Phlebotomy,
annuary purgations, or the like
meanes, as Galen himſelfe affirmeth in his
ſixt Commentary vpon the 47. Aphoriſme
of Hipocrates, where he reporteth, that he
had cured, inchoatam Elephantiaſin, by
thoſe remedies. Now therfore let euery diſcreete
Patient remember the common ſaying
out of the witty Lattin Poet: Principijs obſta.
Stoppe the beginninges: together with
that alſo which followeth.
               Serò medicina paratur.
               Cum mala per longas inualuere moras.
               To which effect the vulgar Hexameter,
prouerbially vſed, might likewiſe be fitly applyed:
Maximus ê minima ſcintilla naſcitur
ignis.
               
               
                  
And yet I graunt the Phiſitian may euen
in this extremity geue the patient good councell,
he may wiſh him wel, and ſo foorth, and
peraduenture eaſe the importunity of his malady
ſome litle deale: Sed hoc aliquid, paene
nihil eſt, & the verſes are famouſly knowen.

                     Vtile non eſt,
                     Conſiliū poſt facta dari, quod oportuit ante;
                     Conſilium poſt facta, Imber poſt tempora frugū.
                  
Wherfore if poſſibly it may be, the firſt houre
of the diſeaſe approaching, is diligently to be
obſerued, and truly ſignified vnto the Phiſitian,
as Hermes Triſmegiſtus aduiſeth in
his Iathromathematica: that a figure for
that time being erected, and the Poſition or
conſtitution of the heauens not ſleightly, but
throughly conſidered, the cunning Phiſitian
may therby iudicially gather, whether the diſeaſe
be curable aud ſuppliable by medicine, or
whether yt patient be deſtitute of hope, & paſt
recouery. But they yt deſire to know more cō
                  cerning
this point, may haue recourſe to the
ſaid Iatromathematica, tranſlated not long
ſince into our engliſh tongue, by my ſelf, at the
requeſt of M. Charles P. a very ſpeciall frend
of mine. Which tranſlation, I haue here alſo
purpoſely annexed at the end of this ſmall
Treatiſe, for the generall benefit, and commoditie
of thoſe, which are deſirous thereof, that
they may with ſo much the more eaſe, and les
labour, attaine to ſome reaſonable knowledge

of thoſe moſt neceſſarie ſecretes, which Hernes
Aegyptius, the firſt and moſt auncient
Aſtrologer, that hath committed any thinge
to writing, (who liued before the incarnation
of our Sauiour, 1488. yeares,) lefte behinds
him for the perpetuall good, and vſe of al ſuch,
as were to ſucceade him in the heauenly practiſe
of Aſtrologie, and phiſicall Philoſophy.
But reſeruing mine opinion of this famous
Mercury, and his profound works, to ſome
other time, I am to returne againe to that Aſtrologicall
iudgement before drawn from
the Lordly dominion of cruell Saturne ouer
the 6. houſe, and his ſituacion in the 8. place
from the Horoſcope. Where I furthermore
obſerue, that this infortunate Constellation,
doth not onely preſignifie and prognoſticate
many contagious, and peremptory infirmities
amongſt men, (as is alreadye according
to the rules of Arte probably declared)
but alſo a great diſtruction, and mortality amongſt
all kind of ſmall beaſtes, and cattell:
as Dorotheus one of the 9. Iudges, doth in
the verie like caſe conclude. But foraſmuch
as the two great Lumynaries, are amongſt
the reſt of the planets, the principal and moſt
effectuall workers in al naturall & terreſtriall
bodies, tam animatis, 
                        
                           
                        
                        quam
                      inanimatis, as Ptolomy
proueth more at large in the 1. booke,
and 2. chap. of his Quadripartite conſtruction.
                  
by whoſe influence ſpecially; fit incrementū
& deſtructio omnis Indiuidui Animalis,
as Haly alſo very well commenteth vpon
this 86. Aphoriſme of Ptolomyes Centiloquia:
Sol eſt origo virtutis vitalis, quae eſt
Cordis: Luna eſt origo virtutis naturalis,
quae eſt Epatis: particularly in priuate natiuities
conſidered, but generally in all publike,
and not onely Aſtrologicall predictions, but
alſo Phiſicall and Philoſophicall diſcourſes,
maintained and obſerued: we are neceſſarily
conſtrayned at all times to haue eſpeciall reſpect
vnto their motions, but cheefly to the
courſe and motion of the Moone, who as the
auncient Aſtrologers affirme, is: Delatrix
omnium impreſsionum & influentiarum
aliorum planetarum, quae per globum ipſius
ad nos vltimó decendunt. Wherefore
I will here alſo diſcipher their ſeuerall inclinations,
and effectes: with the proper and naturall
ſignifications of each of them, according
to their ſcituation, and conſtitution in the celeſtiall
figure, at the time of this great Coniunction:
but ſo that I will auoyd to repeate
any iudgement already ſet downe by my brother
in his Aſtrologicall diſcourſe. The vertues
and debilities of the princely Plannets,
Sol, and Luna, are at the beginning of this
Treatiſe, ſet downe by way of partition:
Wherefore (to cut off al ſuch Tantologies) I

not be ſo tedious, or forgetfull of all good Methode,
as to rehearſe the ſame againe in this
place. But forſomuch as their debilities are
mo in number thē their dignities, I am by the
way to conclude (as I did before) that they are
very vnfortunately appointed in the preſent
ſcheme: and conſequently, that many miſchiefes,
with much vnwonted ſorrow, are preſaged
therby. Marry this amongſt the reſt,
is ſpecially worthy the noting, that the Sun is
then within 3. degrees, 50. minutes of the
moſt violent and moſt mortal fixed ſtar in the
whole firmament, amongſt 1022. called cō
                  monly,
Gorgonium, ſiue caput Meduſae,
barbarouſly of the Arabians, Caput Algol,
whoſe Longitude is in the 20. grade, 38. mi.
of Taurus: Latitude from the Ecliptike line.
23. grades, 0. min. A ſtarre of the ſecond magnitude,
that is, 90. times ſo big as the earth: of
the nature of Saturne and Iupiter, but of
Complexion ſomewhat temperate being
Septentrional. Which Starre, conſidering
it is ſo nigh the Cuſpis of Caeli Culmen,
the Sunne being then alſo therein ſituated, but
peregriue, and almoſt conioyned therewith;
it ſhould by all Aſtrologicall Iudicials ſeem,
that ſome ſuddayn miſchiefe, and violent oppreſſion,
is progneſticated and portended to
ſome great perſonage, or mighty magiſtrate,
placed in high ſeate, and ſupreame autority:

as by the ſequele is moſt like to appeare,
where it ſhall happen.
               
                  Luna is likewiſe in the prefixed figure extraordinarily
afflicted, and oppreſſed by the
preſence and company of another moſt cruell
and miſchieuous fixed ſtar, called of the Graecians
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , barbarouſly, Cor Scorpij,
whoſe Longitude is in the 3. grade, 40. minute
of Sagittary, Latitude 4. degrées, 0, minute.
A ſtarre of the ſecond Magnitude alſo,
but of the nature of Mars, with a litle ſpice of
Iupiter; Complexionis magis humectantis,
quam Comburentis, quia Meridionalis.
Which Coniunction, ſignifieth as I cō
                  iecture,
the furious audacity, and outragious
impudency of thoſe which ſhall ſeditiouſly ariſe,
and priutly conſpire againſt their Magiſtrates,
preſaged by the late oppoſition of Luna
with Venus, Ladie of the tenth houſe, who
is alſo conioyned with a violent Martial fixed
ſtar, of ye firſt honor or Magnitude, yt is, 107.
times ſo big as ye earth, called of the Grecians,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : of the Romaines, Pallilicium:
of the Arabians, Aldebaram, and moſt commonly
of our late Aſtrologers, Oculus Tauri
Auſtralis, ſiue ſiniſter: But becauſe my
brother Richard in his diſcourſe hath more at
large deſcribed the ſame oppoſition of Venus,
and Luna, according to their celeſtiall ſituation
at that time, purpoſing not, as I ſayd, to

reiterate anything heare, that is there ſufficiently
expreſſed, I wil go forward with ye reſt,
remitting the ſtudious reader to ye page in his
booke: but not omitting to cōſider this by the
way, yt the effects & operatiōs of the great Cō
                     iunction,
are like to be the more fearful & terrible,
by reaſon of this infortunate conſtitution
of the Sun and Moone at that inſtant.
               Item, Iupiter, Lord of the Weſt Angle,
placed in the 8. houſe from the Aſcendent, &
there infortunately afflicted by the preſent
Coniunction of frowning Saturne, who is
gouernor of ye 5. houſe 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   ſignifieth
extreame ſorrow, with much perrill & danger
vnto women labouring with child: or els, that
many women ſhal take great care, and be ſore
greeued for their children, becauſe they ar not.
The ſame conſtellation threatneth likewiſe,
much ſhrewde diſſention and hatred betwixt
man and wife. Moreouer, Mars, Lord of Imū
Caeli, placed in domo 12. wil help to increaſe
the trouble and anguiſh of parentes for their
childrens cauſes, afore mentioned.
               Item, Venus, Domina domus dominij,
being there alſo reſidēt, but ſituated in the 11.
ſigne, accompanied wt 
                  Catabibazon, in caſu ſuo,
id eſt, in oppoſitione exaltationis ſuae: ſignifieth
exceeding much quarrelling, ſtrife and contention,
touching matters of the 10. houſe, in
ſome countrey ſubiect to the gouernment of

the ſigne Gemini: A ſigne of the partition of
the thyrd Quadrangle.
               
               Alſo, Venus, Domina domus Fratrum,
Sororum, Conſanguineorum &c. being appointed
as is before rehearſed, doth furthermore
prognoſticate very much falſe dilſimulation,
and tretcherie euen amongſt brethren
and kinſfolke, who ſhall hinder, indammage,
& hurt one another by ſome cuſoning menes,
and by diuers vnfaithfull, wily, and deceitfull
dealings. One notable token amongſt many
other of the worlds ſmall continuance, as by
the holy Scripture might eaſily be proued.
               Item, Mercury peregrine in the nienth
houſe, there placed in Ariete, foretelleth, as I
ſuppoſe, the comming of certaine ſtrange Ambaſſadors,
into this Realme of England, about
ſome matters touching Religion, for
this Iland is ſubiect to the dominion, and
regiment of that ſigne. Whereunto I adde,
that Mercury, Lord of the ſecond houſe, vnluckely
ſeated in the ninth houſe, portendeth
much los of goods to trauailers, meſſengers,
merchants, and generally to all Mercuriſtes,
as well on the land by theeues, and robbers,
as on the ſeas, by ſhipwracks and Pyrates.
Which is alſo more plainly preſignified by
the oppoſition of Pars Fortunae to the ſeconde
houſe, in the Cuſpis of the eight houſe, which
oppoſition ſeemeth to threaten, not onely

loſſe of ſubſtance, but of life too. And therfore
the foreſaide perſons are to prouide for themſelues
accordingly.
               Hetherto I haue orderly by Aſtrologicall
Analyſis, proceaded in diſciphering the ſtate
of the heauens, at the time of the foreſaid notable
Coniunction, by interlacing thoſe

                     •
                  udgements, which being by him pretermit

                  ed,
I haue ſince the ſecond Impreſſion of my
brothers booke, gathered out of as good, and
autenticall Doctors, as any we haue. Now,
that nothing may ſeeme to be wanting in
this preſent Tractate, being ioyned to his former
Diſcourſe, which might Aſtrologically be
obſerued touching the ſame great Coniunction:
I thinke it not only not inconuenient, but
alſo requiſite to note briefly ſome Iudicials,
concerning the dearth and plentie of thoſe Astrologicall
partes mentioned at the beginning
of this Treatiſe: which partes although
commonly they are onely conſidered of the
beſt Aſtrologers, ether generally at ye 
                  Sunsen
                     
                        •
                     ance
into the point Equinoctial Vernal, for

                     •
                  he whole yeere immediatly following, if a

                     ••
                  ed ſigne, (as either Taurus, Leo, Scorpius,

                        •
                      Aquarius) be then Aſcendent in the Eaſt

                        •
                     ngle, or els particularly at the beginning or

                     •
                  ery Aſtronomicall Reuolution, for the

                     •
                  uarter next enſuing, yet notwithſtanding,

                     •
                  ſomuch as the virtuall influence of any

great Coniunction of the ſuperior Planets,
is more notable, yea and more forcible too.
then the influence of the Sunnes circular returne,
to that indiuiſible point of the Zodiack
from which he firſt digreſſed, as ſome of the
moſt approoued Aſtrologers affyrme. I ſuppoſe,
that as great and as certaine a teſtimony,
either of dearth, or of plentifulneſſe enſuing,
may Aſtrologically be drawen from the
ſituation and conſtitution of the Planets in
the celeſtiall ſcheme, at the time of this rare
and ſtrange Coniunction, as otherwiſe from
the poſition of the ſuperior bodies in the heauenly
figure at the Sunnes annuary recourſe,
A puncto ad punctum ſigniferi. For as this
famous and memorable meeting of the two
ſupreme and moſt mighty Planets in the laſt
face of Piſces, hapneth very ſeldome, to wit,
but once in the ſpace and continuance of 800.
yeares, ſo when it chaunceth, it commonly
cauſeth ſome ſudden changes, and violent alterations,
either by meanes of ſedition and
warres, or conſequently by famine and penurie,
proceeding of the barrenneſſe and ſterility
of the earth, therby preſaged & prognoſticated
which my brother Richard hath already in
my opinion ſufficiently confirmed in his Diſcourſe.
Wherfore, I will here now compendiouſly,
but diſtinctly, ſet downe the ſignifications
of thoſe parts, drawen partly from the

ſignes wherein they are placed, but eſpecially
from the Lords of the ſignes, thoſe I meane,
that haue moſt eſſential dignities in ye ſame,
concluding according to their ſituation & conſtitution
in the prefixed Figure, ſiue in Angulo,
ſiue ſuccedenti illi fuerint, ſeu cadenti
Domo. Withall, regarding their ſeuerall aſpectes,
and mutuall radiatious, as alſo whether
Dominus domus be come ad locum
Deſcentionis ſuae, and ſo forth. But I imagine
it ſhal ſuffyce for the preſent, to declare
the bare iudgements only, that is, the effectes
ſignified, by noting in a word, which partes
ſhalbe Cari precii, which medii, or indifferentis
precii, and finally, which humilis, or
vilis precii. The cauſes and reaſons of euery
Iudiciall, euery one that is but meanly trauailed
in the Principles of Aſtrologie, may
of him ſelfe ſoone gather, and eaſily diſcerne:
neither do I loue to be verbally tedious, whē
fewe wordes may as well, or rather better
ſerue the turne. Fruſtra enim longius fit per
plura, quod breuius fieri potuit per pauciora.
Wherefore to proceede roundly to the
expected Diſtinction, the foreſayd partes,

                     
                     Concerning
the
dearth or
cheapneſſe
thereof,
are by
my Aſtrologicall
iudgementes
like to
be either

                           Of a high, or
deare price,
as namely
theſe.

                                 Pars oliuarum: whereof Thales Mileſius
toke ſo notable aduauntage,
for the enrichment of himſelfe.
                                 Pars hordei:
                                 Pars ciborum amarorum.

                                 Pars ſiſami.
                                 Pars nucum.
                                 Pars lentis.

                                 Pars Nucum.
                                 Pars Melonum.
                              
                           
                           Of an indifferent
and
more reaſonable
price.
as

                                 Pars tritici.
                                 Pars Ciceris.
                                 Pars ſacchari.
                                 Pars Mellis.
                                 Pars ciborum dulcium.
                                 Pars croci.

                           Of a lowe
price, or good
cheape, as

                                 Pars fabarum.
                                 Pars Vuarum.
                                 Pars dactylorum.
                                 Pars Caeparum.
                                 Pars ciborum acrium.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Euery one that vnderſtandeth any Latine
may ſufficiently play the Interpreter.
               
                  
Which ſhort partition may generally ſuffice
for a competent knowledge of the forenamed
parts, vntill they ſhall be more diligentlie
conſidered, and more particularly diſcuſſed
by me, in euery ſeuerall yéere, as vpon ſemblable
occaſion, I ſhall then more ſpeciallie
obſerue the ſame at the Sunnes annuary recourſe
into the firſt Second of Aries. I haue
here ſummarily inſerted this little, as a briefe
teſtimonie eyther of dearth or plentifulneſſe
enſuing, drawen onely, as I ſaid, from the
ſituation of the Planets, at the time whereof
I now ſpeake, but in my yéerely Almanacke
I purpoſe, by Gods good leaue, more exactlie,
and ſo farre as I may poſſibly attaine therevnto,
more perfectly to examine the ſame according
to the infallible Rules of this Arte, at
the ſeueral reuolutions of euery ſeueral yéere,
ſo continuing till the effects and operations
of this Coniunction ſhall fully be accompliſhed
and ended.
               Nowe touching the Conſtitution of the
ayre, whereof I haue as yet added nothing,
forſomuche as this famous Coniunction
happeneth in Piſces, a ſigne of the partition
of the watery Trigoniſme, I conceiue thereby,
that great ſtore and abundance of rayne
ſhall enſue, which will cauſe many huge inundations,
and ouerflowings in ſundry
places, and that many fierce and boyſterous

winds ſhall eſtfoones breake foorth, the rather
alſo, becauſe both Saturne and Iupiter are
then likewiſe oriental from the Sunne. Nam
Phaenon orientalis eſt frigidae complexionis,
& humidae item Phaēton: wherefore
much troublous and tempeſteous weather
is like to be looked for, which is like ſo long
to continue, how long the one ſhall be within
the Semidiameter of the other, that is,
within nine degrées of the other, for the ſeuerall
Semidiameter of eche of them is 4. degrées,
30. minutes, ſo that concerning the
diſpoſition of the Ayre, the watery effects of
their méeting began the 5. day of February
laſt paſt, this preſent yeere 1583. and ſhall
endure vntill the 14. day of February next
enſuing, Anno 1584.
               Immediatly after the terme or end of theſe
effects, Mercury ſhall receiue both Saturne
and Iupiter: and be corporally conioyned
with them, firſt with Saturne, then with
Iupiter: which portēdeth ſmal good to ſome of
the clergie: for Mercury beeing at the time of
this Coniunction infortunately ſeated in
the 9. houſe, and nowe in Coniunction with
Saturne and Iupiter, ſignifieth the loſſe of
their accuſtomed tiths, yea and the diſpleaſure
of ſome noble perſonages, or great magiſtrates,
through whoſe procurement they
are like to be ſhrewdly hindered and endamaged.

It ſhould ſeeme alſo that they ſhall be
xppreſſed by meanes of ſome Martiall garboyles,
and warres, becauſe their meeting
is in Aries, the diurnall Manſion place of
Mars.
               
               But as touching the whole continuance of
all theſe, or ſuch other terrible Accidents, and
feareful euents, threatned by this grand Copulation
of Saturne and Iupiter, firſt prognoſtically
intreated of by my brother Richard
in his Diſcourſe, and nowe enlarged by my
ſelfe in thie Tractate, I am perſwaded that
they ſhall forcibly begin to take place 
                     〈◊〉
                   in
this preſent yeere 1583. For no doubt much
ſecret villany ſhall be committed, much falſe
packing vſed, much priuy ſedition foſtered,
and great Martiall furniture, and preparance
for warres ſhall be heard of, to ſome mens
coſt, euen within the compaſſe of this very
yeere. Which accordeth with that Maxime of
the noble Prince Leopoldus Auſtriacus, in
theſe very words: Annus ipſe erit peior in
quo Saturnus & Iupiter coniunguntur.
But ſhall ſtill violently continue, and cruelly
inuade the inhabitaunts of the earth, vntill
ſuch time as the one ſhall oppoſe himſelfe
againſt the other by a diametrall irradiatiō,
which according to the true and daily ſphericall
motiōs of theſe Planets exactly calculated
by the excellent Mathematitian Ioannes
                  
                  Stadius, in his Ephemerides; ſhall
fall out iuſt, Anno Domini 1593. the 21.
day of March, about 30. Minuts after thrée
of the clocke in the after noone. Saturne béeing
then placed in Cancer, and Iupiter in
Capricorne, the one in the 11. houſe, the other
in the 5. houſe, as appeareth by the Figure,
which I haue here calculated for the
very time of their Oppoſition, at which
time the diſtance from the one to the other
ſhall be 180. Degrées.
            
            
               
               The Caeleſtiall ſcheme, calculated for
the future oppoſition of Saturne and
Iupiter.

So that the perillous effects of this grand
Coniunction ſhall continue and ſtill increaſe
on, vntill the accompliſhment almoſt of ten
whole yeeres hereafter enſuing, which then
ſurceaſing, the operations of their oppoſition
ſhall begin to worke, beeing in like maner
forcibly to take place & perdure till their
next Coniunction, which ſhall not happen
vntill the yeere 1603. the 21 day of December
about high noon: at which time they ſhal
be conioyned agayne in the 10. grade, 26. minute
of Sagittary, a ſigne of the partition of
the fiery Triangularity, and then the Mathematicall
circuit beeing fully finiſhed, the effects
of this Coniunction, and oppoſition,
ſhall togither end, and not before. Etenim
effectus durant vſque ad reditum, quia nihil
datur inane in natura, as is well noted
by Cardane. But I am of opinion, that the
effects of their oppoſition, ſhall be more violent
and ſpeedie, than of this very Coniunction.
Nam diametrae radiationes, quemadmodum
& Tetragoniſmi, mortes repentinas,
& violentas mutationes faciunt, Cō
                     greſſus
verò generalia Accidentia, as one
very learnedly iudgeth. And Haly the Arabian
in the 8. part, & 6. chapter of his Aſtrologicall
Iudicials, ſeemeth to affirme, that,
Diametralis cōfiguratio, eſt fortior & maioris
vigoris, quàm vllus alius aſpectus; in

writing thus: Scito quod oppoſitio Saturni
& Martis eſt deterior eorum Coniunctione,
& deteriores, ac maligniores ſignificationes
demonſtrat. Beſide theſe, Guido
Bonatus in the 13. chapter of his ſeconde
Treatiſe, confirmeth the very ſame, where
he determineth flatly, that Oppoſitio eſt aſpectus
vltimatae inimicitiae, vltimatae maliciae,
& vltimatae diſcordiae; his reaſon is,
Quia trahitur â Saturno, & â Luminaribus;
nam domus Saturni aſpiciunt domos
Luminarium ab oppoſitione: ideoue dicitur
iſte aſpectus perfectae inimicitiae, quo
niam Saturnus eſt infortunium maius, &
fortior caeteris alijs infortunijs. But as
concerning this preſent oppoſition, it ſeemeth
extraordinarily malicious, and extremly
pernicious, in that they are moſt vnhappily
affected, & afflicted, in caſibus, & detrimentis
ſuis: Quae quidem conſtellatio Religioni
maximum periculum minatur. A iudgement
ouer true. But becauſe I purpoſe hereafter,
if God ſpare me life, to diſcourſe more at
large of theſe particulars, I wil here only add
this one reſolute & peremptory iudgement of
the great Aſtrologer, Cyprian de Bohemia;
Coniunctiones, oppoſitiones, vel eclypſes,
in Virg. & Capr. quod in his ſignis Iupiter
religionis Iudex magnopere debilitetur,
mutationes in religione, ſacroue ordine
                  
denunciant. Wherfore I will nowe returne
againe to the preſent Coniunction, from
which I haue a little digreſſed. The continuance
of wheſe effects beeing expreſlie declared,
it followeth, that we likewiſe expreſly
determine, de ſubiectis locis, in what Countries
and Cities they ſhall eſpecially worke,
and moſt effectually ſhewe them ſelues. For
Ptolomey ſaith, Vnuſquiſque locus habet
ſuum ſignum & Planetam proprium. And
that in reſpect of ſome other Aſtrologicall circumſtances
is the reaſon, as Ganiuetus affirmeth,
that the plague, or any other noyſome
and notorious calamitie happeneth in
ſome one particuler towne or citie, rather
then in another, they beeing both ſituated in
one and the ſelfe ſame Region. Wherefore
concerning the preſent Coniunction, I ſuppoſe
that thoſe Realmes and Cities ſhall chiefly
be vexed and afflicted with the euill influence
thereof, which are vnder the partition
of the third Quadrangle, that is, vnder theſe
foure ſignes, Gemini, Virgo, Sagittary,
Piſces. Vnto which ſignes ſuch Regions and
Cities are ſubiect, as are particularly allotted
to eche of them, and here ſeuerally deſcribed

to be very ſubiect to the foreſaid great Coniunction,
not onely bicauſe the ſigne Aſcending in the

hapneth, but alſo becauſe certaine other iudgements,

But euen amongſt theſe very nations,
countries, Ilands, territories, cities, & townes
named and diſtinguiſhed here by me, according
to the inſtructions of the beſt Aſtrologers,
and Coſmographers, there is alſo a
great difference. For thoſe perſons ſhall eſpecially
be vexed, and oppreſſed by this infortunate
poſition of the celeſtiall bodies, in
whoſe Radix, or otherwiſe in the annuary
profection of the natiuitie, the 21. grade, eyther
of Piſces, Sagittary, Virgo, Gemini,
Capricorne, or Aquary, is by progreſſion
Aſcendent in the Horoſcope, or in whoſe
natiuitie, the Sunne, the Moone, or 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                  Geniturae, is reſident in the ſame
grade of any of thoſe ſignes, or within fiue
degrées of that grade: for they are moſt like
to be ſore tormented, and vehemenly diſquieted
with the troublous affections, and perturbations
of the mind, yea and gréeuouſlie
afflicted with diuerſe noyſome and wofull infirmities
of the body, which ſhall become
mortall and peremptory vnto thoſe, which
haue Saturne thus ill affected vpon the 8.
Cuſpis, or whoſe Hylech or Alchocoden, is
ill affected in any of the ſaid places of the Zodiake.
               
               But they, which in their Radix haue Culmen
Medij Coeli, or Pars Fortunae appointed
in the ſame parts of the Signifier, ſhall

ſuffer in honor, worſhippe, ſubſtance, and riches,
and be vyolently wronged by ſome
cruell and extraordinary miſchaunces to befall
them.
               And they moreouer, which haue any of the
other ſiue erraticall ſtarres, as either Mars,
Venus, or Mercury, ſituated in the ſame degree
of thoſe Signes, ſhall by ſome miſchieuous
meanes or other, be in like manner hindred
and indammaged according to the naturall
ſignification, qualitie, and inclination of
each of them ſo diſpoſed.
               All and ſingular which foreſaid euents ſhal
be multiplyed and increaſed, if any hurtfull
direction of the natiuine ſhall then happen,
which doth conſent, or any waies accord with
this Coniunction. But if any fauourable,
and friendly direction ſhall come in place, the
leſſe harme is to be feared, nay in this caſe, directions
are alwayes to be preferred before
the great Coniunctions, or Oppoſitions of
the ſuperior planets, as alſo before the Eclypſes
of the Sunne, and Moone, for that their
effectes are more forcible and effectuall then
the operations of any ſuch Copulations, or
obſcurations, which worke only as generall
cauſes, and do therfore hurte thoſe men chiefly,
whoſe natiuities accorde with the firſt beginninges
or foundations of any ſuch Regions,
or Cities, as are moſt like to feele and

ſuffer the cruell influence and terrible operations
of any ſuch heauenly Accidents.
               Here therfore I am to leaue euery man to
the conſideration of his owne priuate natiuitie,
howbeit I could my ſelfe rehearſe ſome
of good calling, whoſe Horoſcopes are
thus appointed, but that I intend not to become
odious, or tedious by this kinde of
commemoration, to any particular perſon,
eyther nowe in this Treatiſe, or hereafter
in any other more learned and painefull Diſcourſe
touching theſe or the like poyntes,
where notwithſtanding they mighte happily
ſerue to a greater purpoſe, and farther
vſe, then nowe preſently they may, for
proofe and triall of the foreſaide euentes,
as they ſhall afterwardes fall out more effectually.
But I am growen ſomewhat
longer, then I purpoſed in the beginning,
and therefore will heere drawe towardes
an ende, moſte heartily committing
euery man, to the ſerious care and
regarde of his owne ſafetie, and conſequently
to the tuition of the omnipotent Adonay,
who of his infinite and ſingular mercies
and goodnes, graunt, that we which nowe
liue for a time, may in time ſo liue to the
true and ſincere worſhippe of him that liueth
for euer and euer, that by ſo liuing
wee maye learne to dye, and by ſo

dying liue with him for euermore. Sub Lunae

ſunt leges, veri Dei cultus negligitur,
falſorum Deorum religio nimis propagatur,
as Ioannes Tritemius wryteth of
that age in his booke de ſeptem Secundeis,
And doeth it not behoue vs to take carefull
heede, and beware in time, leſt a newe Ioannes
Tritemius, or ſome other of greater credite
hereafter ariſe, to diſcredite this our loſt

of the goſpel, which being neuer ſo plentifully
taught, was neuer more ſcantly learned,
and being neuer ſo truely preached, was
neuer more falſly followed, or more lightly regarded,
then now generally it is. The more
preſent ſhame, the more future puniſhment.
What maruell therfore though ſuch plagues
hang ouer our heades? What maruell
though Gods vengeance be at hand, nay even
now ready to fal downe vpon vs, to oppreſſe,
and conſume vs? What maruell though the
ordinarie courſe, as wel of all naturall, as of
morall things be quite turned topſie turuie?

               In which Prognoſtical Epigrame, Hieronimus
Wolfius, whom our Maſter Aſchame
in his diſcourſe of Germaine affaires, calleth
his very friend, and whoſe excellent learning
partly by his Tranſlations, and explications
of Demoſthenes, and Ipocrates, partly by
his other as well Aſtrologicall, as Philoſophicall,
and humanity writings, is famouſly
knowen ouer all Europe. In which Propheticall
Epigrame, I ſay, this learned man
hath truely deſcribed, and as it were liuely
painted out the wicked peruerſity & peruerſe
wickednes of this age: with a neceſſary inuectiue

againſt the abuſes, and enormities
now raigning: by conferring and comparing
the ſame with the manifold tokens and miracles
Aſtrologically prognoſticated, touching
the future moſt miſerable eſtate, and condition
of the world, which ſhall ſhortly no doubt
more ſenſibly appeare, to the terror and aſtoniſhment
of all reaſonable Creatures then liuing.
I meane not here to recapitulate the
horrors of the marueilous yeere, 1588. or to
vnfolde other auncient predictions, & prophecies,
in which, Concluſio, as we ſay in Logick,
Semper ſequitur deteriorem partem,
I would to God, the ſhadowe of the earth, and
earthly things, did not take away the cleare
light of the Sunne from vs, and cauſe an horrible
Eclypſe in vs. Lord, that euery man
would priuately contend to amend one, and
both priuately and publikely pray for the amendement
of all. How ſoone would God be
moued to deale with vs, as he did by the Niniuites,
whoſe puniſhment, vpon their vnfained
repentance was differred long beyonde
the compaſſe of the 40. dayes, prophetically
forethreatened by Ionas? And did it not pleaſe
God to prolong the life of king Ezechias for
the ſpace of 15. yeeres, notwithſtanding that
the Prophet Iſaias had prognoſticated his
death, as at hand within one day? Other examples
might be alledged, to ſhew that puniſhments

decreed from aboue, are in ſome
part alterable, vpon humble ſignification of a
contrite and reformed heart: Which God
graunt to all his elect, and namely to vs in
England, whome he hath ſo graciouſly indued
with ſo many, and ſo long enduring felicities.
For the proſperous continuance, and perfection
whereof, my final wiſh, and prayer is, as
I haue compryſed the ſame, in theſe foure
rude, but hartie verſes:

                     
                        Elizabeta diu, atque diu cum Principe Regnū

                     Scilicet haec Anglis Omega, & Alpha ſuis.
                  
               
            
            
               
               The Concluſion.
               
                  NOwe good Brother, as in
the beginning of this treatiſe,
I addreſſed my preface
vnto you, ſo hauing thus
ſupplied ſuch Additions, as
I thought requiſite to bee
annexed to my brother Richards
Aſtrologicall Diſcourſe, I am here in
the end to committe, or rather ſubmitte the
ſame, as wel to your iudgement for reformation,
as to the Cenſure of our learnedſt Aſtrologers,
for allowance or diſalowance. The
only fauour I require at their handes, is this,
that they would iudge as they finde, without
any ſpice of parciality, which oftentimes corrupteth,
euē the ſoundeſt iudgements otherwiſe.
I would be loath to attribute, or arrogate
too much vnto myſelfe: let other determine
for me, or againſt me, as with indifferency,
grounded vpon reaſonable ſkill, they
ſhall ſee occaſion.
               I was here purpoſed to haue taken my
leaue; But ſeeing it hath bene my good hap,
(for ſo I interprete it) ſince my ſupplement
of the former additions, to light vpon two
new bookes, ſpecially concerning theſe matters,
the one a French Almanacke, or rather
diſcourſe of certaine Aſtrologicall Accidents,
either lately hapned, or ſhortly to happen: the

other a prognoſticall iudgement of one Robert
Tanner, touching the foreſaid Coniunction,
I am bold to trouble you a ittle longer,
with a note or two, concerning them. As for
the French diſcourſe, I can ſay the leſſe for
my ſmall ſkil in French, yet thus farre dare I
preſume vpon the very Title, or Inſcription,
thereof, that Docteur Francois Liberati de
Rome, is none of the perfecteſt Aſtrologers,
either in Italy, or in France. For in naming
le 2, Iour de May, for the time of the Grand
Coniunction, he ſheweth him ſelf ouermuch
addicted to his maſter Cyprian de Boëmme,
who contenteth him ſelfe with Alphonſus
Calculation, whereas according to Stadius,
a more exacte and abſolute Mathematitian,
following the moſt perfect Rules of Prolomy,
and Copernicus, it is certainly to happen
vpon the 28. of April, which my brother
Richard & I haue therfore reſolutely ſet down,
notwithſtāding our knowledge of Leouitius
& Meſtlinus difference. Marry he promiſeth to
make an amends, in his Ephemerides, and
diſcourſe of the reformation of the yeere, and
of the Paſque: which I may hap expect a good
while yet, if he hold the right veyne of ſome
Italians. In the meane while, ſee how his laſt
iudgement iumpeth with ours, for the courſe
and ſtate of the yeere preſent, Et finablement

                      An. 1583. ſera pluuieux, & dangereux pour lee

biens de la terre, et anſsi repentini tumultus et apparatus
belli. And therefore we are hartily to
wiſh, & pray with him, Dieu par ſa miſericorde
nous delieure du mal et du danger que par les Aſtres,
nous ſommes menazes, & nous enuoye la
paix, & laſainct grace. Which is al that I am
preſently to note touching the contents of that
French diſcourſe. Now as for old Tanners
Prognoſtical iudgemēt, who intituleth himſelfe
a ſtudent in Aſtrology, and Coſmography,
he were the rather to be borne withall, if
his ignorance and ſimplicitie, ſauoured not ſo
much of ſelfe lyking. I cannot but maruaile,
that hauing ſeene the other Diſcourſe, he was
not aſhamed to put foorth his: wherin his
only labor in a manner is, to ſet downe his
ſchemes in letters, being before deſcrybed in
Figures. For what is all the reſt, but a mingle
mangle of ſtealths, and patcheries out of
Leouitius, Rogers ſecond comming of
Chriſt, the French Almanack, and my Brothers
Diſcourſe, out of which, hee hath
more then once, or twiſe culled out whole
ſides verbatim, without any mention of
him, together with certaine iudgementes
of Stadius, applyed without all iudgement,
in referring the ſame to no other Meridian,
then that, which the ſaid Stadius reſpected
in his calculation for the latitude of
Anwerpe. And alas, what other iudgements

are in that ſily Pamphlet, whereof it ſhould
beare the name of A Prognoſticall iudgement?
Truly were it not, that his pretended
deſire and zeale to doo good, may ſeeme ſome
way to excuſe him, the ſimple old ſtudent in
Aſtrology, and Coſmography, were otherwiſe
to be handled for his ſimple young labour,
then I will here ſpeake of. Which neuertheleſſe
I write not ſo much to diſgrace
him, or to credite my ſelfe, as to aduiſe the
diſcret Reader not to ſuffer him ſelfe to be abuſed
by any ſuche gloſes of good intention,
but to ſuſpend his iudgement vpon triall, before
he reſolue vpon truſt. The olde fellowe
may perhaps beare him ſelfe vpon his experience,
as it is ſaid he chéefly doth: but as reading
can do little without reaſonable good experience,
ſo experience cannot do very muche
without reaſonable good reading: which to ſay
troth, ſeemeth to be farre from this wofull
Prognoſticall Iudge. And that which is
moſte of all, he concealeth their names, to
whom he is moſt beholding: and publiſheth
that for his owne, which God wot he hath
litle right or title vnto. You know who affirmeth,
Ingenui Animi eſt, profiteri per
quos profeceris: and may not my brother
ſay to this olde Coſmographer, as Tully
doth in one place? Tu, qui a Naeuio vel ſumpſiſti
multa, ſi fateris: vel, ſi negas, ſurripuiſti.
                  
But God, and the world forgiue him, as
we do: and let both him and all other account
of vs no otherwiſe, then they find vs in very
déed: which I am ſure is your chiefe deſire.
I might eaſily enlarge this Epiloge with
interlacing of other matters: and namely
touching Hermes moſt learned Iatromathematica,
and my Tranſlation thereof, annexed
to the preſent Treatiſe, for certaine
good conſiderations: but to auoyde tediouſnes,
as well vnto you, as vnto euery other
curteous Reader, I will here ceaſe from interrupting
your weightier ſtudies, and moſt
hartily commit them, and your ſelfe vnto
God: with like commendations from all our
friends in Walden, Stanſted, and Mayners.
