               To a letter ye which to Rome is late come,
            
            
               
                  
                     I
                   Doe eſteme your kyndnes much
               For ſendyng worde ſo ſone,
               Your diligence it hath ben ſuch
               It is ariued at Rome:
               But when I had pervſd your byl
               In that you ſet thereto your wyl
               And eke your mynd applyed vntyl
               The writyng of the ſame.
               I did beleue it to be true
               But ſurely I muſt ſay to you
               It greued mee thoſe lines to vew
               Were wrtten in your name.
            
            
               
                  ❧And ſure it is no maruell loe
               For daylye I doe heare,
               The matter ſemeth to be ſo
               As amply doth appeare:
               For euery man doth tell for true
               The ſame that late was ſent of you
               But out alas, your tidynges new
               Doth much appall my ſpirite.
               And makes me ſweare and makes me teare
               To pull and hale, and rend my heare
               And brynges me dayly in diſpaire
               To thinke on this deſpite.
            
            
               ¶But ſith there is no remedye
               That mine obedient chylde,
               Is hanged vp vpon a tree
               And to to much reuylde:
               What ſhoulde I doe but curſe and ban
               And hurte them toe the worſt I can
               For hanging vp ſo good a man
               That bare mee ſuch good wyll?
               But yf I had him here at Rome
               His body ſhould be ſhryned ſoone
               And maſſe at mornyng and at noone
               With chantyng of each bell.
            
            
               ¶For euer ſhoulde be ſayd and ſoung
               The deuyls to controvle,
               And prayers all aboute his tombe
               With ſenceyng for his ſoule:
               That neuer a deuyll ſo deepe in hell
               Shoulde once preſume with him to mell
               Nor once approch his body tyll
               To vexe him any way.
               And I wolde kepe his body ſo
               That it from hence ſhould neuer go
               And dyuers of my fryers mo
               For him ſhould dayly pray.
            
            
               ¶And gladly wolde I be reuengd
               On England yf I might,
               Becauſe they haue toe much a abuſd
               My Bull with great deſpight:
               And make thereat a laughing game
               And ſet but little by my name
               And much my holynes defame
               And dayly me diſpyſe.
               Their Queene hath chaſt the rebels all
               That loued to bow their knees to Ball
               And hanged their quarters on the wall
               As meat for crowes and pyes.
            
            
               ¶But I wyll walke and dayly ſeke
               My Purgatorie thorow,
               And cauſe all the deuyls at my becke
               To me their knees to bow:
               And where as I may any fynde
               That to their Prince haue ben vnkynde
               Be ſure, with mee they ſhall be ſhrynde
               As they deſerued haue.
               And cheefly now Iohn Felton hee
               Shall euer be beloued of mee
               Becauſe that he ſo louinglye
               My Bull did ſeeme to ſaue.
            
            
               ¶But yf that I coulde haue at once
               The paryng of his toe,
               His head, his quarters, or his bones
               That with the wynde doe bloe:
               Then ſhoulde they be layd vp by mee
               As reliques of great dignitie
               For euery man that comes to ſee
               Thoſe Iewels of ſuch grace.
               The Nortons bones ſhould ſo be ſhrynd
               That now hanges wauering in the wynd
               Yf that I coulde deuyſe or fynd
               To bryug them to this place.
            
            
               ¶And I wyll curſe and ban them all
               That ſpeake againſt my powre,
               And ſeekes to make my kyngdome fall
               My curſe ſhall them deuowre:
               And yf that here I might you ſee
               For wrytyng lately vnto mee
               Be ſure, ye ſhould rewarded bee
               As beſt I coulde bethynke.
               And as for Wylliam Elderton
               That lately ſent me worde to Rome
               Be ſure that he ſhould haue lyke dome
               To bye him pen and ynke.
            
            
               ¶Take this as written from our grace
               That vnto you we ſend,
               Becauſe we want both time and place
               To recompence you frend:
               As for the boyes that trump and ſcoff
               And at my holynes doe laugh
               I mynd to dreſſe them wel enough
               Yf caſe I had them here.
               And for my ſeruants that abyde
               And long haue had their pacience tryde
               From Romaine faith that wyl not ſlyde
               I wyſh them all good there.
