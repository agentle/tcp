               YE ſhall ſweare that ye ſhall be good and true to our Soueraigne Lady Queene Elizabeth, &c. and to the heyres of our ſayd ſoueraigne Lady the Queene. Obeiſant and obedient ye ſhall be to the Maior and Miniſters of this Citie. The Fraunchiſes & cuſtomes therof ye ſhall maintaine, and this Citie keepe harmeles in that that in you is. Ye ſhall be contributorie to all manner of charges within this Citie, as ſummons, Watches, contributions, taſkes, tallages, lot, and ſcot, and all other charges, bearyng your part as a free man ought to doe. Ye ſhall colour no foreines goodes, whereby the Queene might looſe her cuſtomes or aduaūtages. Ye ſhal know no foreine to buy or ſell any marchaundiſe with any other foreine within ye Citie or the Fraūchiſe therof, but ye ſhall warne the Chamberlaine therof, or ſome miniſter of the Chāber. Ye ſhall impleade or ſue no free man out of this Citie, whiles ye may haue right & law within the ſame Citie. Ye ſhall take none Apprentice, but if he be Free borne (that is to ſay) no bond mans ſonne, nor the child of any alyen, and for no leſſe terme then for ſeuen yeares, within the firſt yeare ye ſhall cauſe him to be enroled, & at his termes end ye ſhall make him free of this Citie (if he haue well & truely ſerued you.) Ye ſhall alſo keepe the Queenes peace in your owne perſons, ye ſhall know no gatheryngs, conuenticles nor cōſpiracies made agaynſt the Queenes peace, but ye ſhall warne the Maior therof, or let it to your power. All theſe pointes and Articles ye ſhall well and truely keepe accordyng to the lawes & cuſtome of this Citie to your power. So God you helpe, and by the holy contentes of this Booke.
