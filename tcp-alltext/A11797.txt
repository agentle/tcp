            A PROGRESSE OF THE Conqueſts of the King of SPAINE, and Houſe of Auſtria in Germany, Switzerland, the Griſons Countrie, Italy, and the Frontiers of France, ſince the death of Henry the Great.
            THE Spaniards continually purſuing the advancement of their univerſall Monarchy, (the firſt foundation whereof were laid by Charles the fift, ſince which time that deſigne hath been ſtill eagerly proſecuted,) haue bin ſo happy in their endeavours in theſe laſt 10 or 12 yeares in diuers parts of Europe: and particularly neere to the borders of France, that there remaines very little for them to conquer; to encompaſſe it on all ſides, and ſo by little and little to make themſelves Majeſtrates and Arbiters of Chriſtendome.
            And to begin with the laſt and freſheſt of their Conqueſts; Beſides the Palatine Electoriall dignity, which they haue put into the hands of one of their confidents: they haue conquered by Armes all the Palatinate, both on this ſide and beyond the Rhine; and within, or neere it, many Citties and ſtrong places, whereof divers are Imperiall free Townes, as namely Wormbs, Spire, Landaw, Haguenau, Wiſſembourg, Fridberg, Gailhaſſen, Wetzlar, and others: together with a good part of the Countrey of Hannau, and of the Countrey of Wetteraw, wherein are

many Counts and Lords neighbours, and Allies to the Prince Elector Palatine: whoſe Brother and Coſens haue beene no more ſpared then the reſt, though not comprehended in the Imperiall Ban, their Lords and Lordſhips being ſeized on, together with the Iointures of the innocent widdow Princeſſes. This notable conqueſt, to take it from Mentz and Haggenaw on the one ſide, and the countries of Trier and Lorraine one the other, and from Francfort almoſt cloſe to Strasbourg, containes in length more then 50 French leagues, and in breadth Fortie. And they ſtill continue to make ſome progreſſe about the Palatinate, vnder colour of paſſages or other pretents: and proceede in their ſecret practiſes vpon diuers other Imperiall Townes, eſpecially that of Strasbourg, (a great and ſtrong place, and of the ancient patrimony of our firſt Kings:) and likewiſe vpon the Towne of Beſanſon, to eſtabliſh a Parliament there, or transferre thither that of Dole. As in the time of Phillip the ſecond, the Admirall of Arragon preſumed to aske the Vicariat of that Towne for the King his Maſter, but it was denied him by the Emperour Rodolph the ſecond. And of late the Miniſters of Spaine haue offered money for certaine places in the Biſhopricke of Liege, for no other end but that we euen now ſpeak of. But that which is moſt monſtrous, is the quarrell they make with the Elector of Brandenbourg, ſeeking an occaſion to make him likewiſe looſe his Electorat, although that Prince hath all this time remained neutriall, and kept intelligence with the Elector of Saxony, who at one time or other will

ſcape no better then the reſt, though he hath aſſiſted the Emperours with his Armes and Counſells, to the preiudice of his neere kindred, whom he dayly ſees to be turned naked to the world.
            All men know that not long before this, the Spaniards had made themſelues Maſters of all that Countrie which lies betweene the Riuers of the Moſell and the Rhine, from the Townes of Liege and Cullen, to Numeguen in Guelderland: and eſpecially of the free and Imperiall Townes of Aix-la-Chappell and Wezell: notwithſtanding the interceſſion of the King and Queene Mother then Regent, both by frequent Letters and Ambaſſadours ſent expreſly for that buſineſſe. And they haue ſince taken by compoſition the Townes and Fortreſſes of Iuliers, and hold entirely the Dutches of Iuliers and Berg, together with all the Townes and places of the Grand Conte de la Marke, and the County of Rauenſberg, with two thirds of the Duchie of Cleues, on this ſide and beyond the Rhine, and the moſt part of it vnder the Duke of Newbourgs name. But the Spaniards hauing their garriſons there, the good Prince can neither inioy the places nor the reuinue, but in very ſmall proportion. And notwithſtanding all his endeauours and dilligence vſed at Bruxells, for freeing himſelfe from thoſe garriſons, yet cannot he hitherto obtaine or preuaile with them in any thing, though he be a Catholike, their friend, and Allie. This conqueſt is not much leſſe worth to the Spaniards, then that of the lower Palatinate, aſwell for the approach which foote by foote they make towards Holland: as for the extent of theſe

Countries, which one with another, from the towne of Aix-la-Chapell to Lipſtat, the laſt place of the County De la Marke, and from thence to the Town of Cleues, amounts vnto aboue foureſcore French leagues in length, and about 50 in breadth. And this without accounting the Fort of Pappe-mutz, ſittuate in an Iſle of the Rhine on this ſide Cullen, lately conquered by the Spaniards, and by them Chriſtened with the name of Iſabella. And in a word, either by aſſociation, or by the conuenience of the Electors of Mentz and Cologue: or by their proper conqueſts, they may call themſelues Maſters of the great Riuer of Rhine, from the Towne of Stratsbourg, yea euen from Briſacke and Basle, to Rees and Emericke, Townes in the Land of Cleue, not farre diſtant from the mouth of that River.
            Furthermore, who knowes not the deſignes of the Spaniards vpon the Countrie of the Griſons, and how the Archduke Leopold on the one ſide, and the Gouernour of Millaine on the other, haue poſſeſt themſelues of the greateſt part of thoſe Countries, hauing put garriſons into Coyre, Mayenfeld, Pretigau, and all other places of the one and other Engadine, euen cloſe to the Canton of Zurich: where the Arch-duke intends to erect a Fort in a certaine place called Steig, thereby to bridle the Switzers, and keepe an entrance into the Countrey. And towards Millaine they haue ſeized vpon the Counties of Chiavenna and Pregaglia, and the long and fertile valley of the Val-telina, (the two ends whereof ioyne Millaine and Tirol) which is the ſubiect of the preſent difference betweene the King of Spaine on the

on ſide, and the Crowne of France, the States of Venice, Sauoy, and generally all Italy, the Switzers and Griſons on the other ſide.
            They haue alſo ſeized on the Counties of Bromio and Valmeſolcina, a faire and large valley neere Bellinzons, towards the Frontiers of Italy: and now of late upon the County of Muſcco, under the title of of the Count of Triuulce his pretence: the foreſaid Conqueſts making altogether, to reckon from Mayenfield to Bormio, and from thence to the Fort Fuentes at the leaſt, 40 French leagues in length, and more the 30 in breadth, as it may euidently appeare by Cluverius his Map of Rhaetia. And although the preſent Pope, being now depoſitary of the moſt parts of theſe Forts and places, labours with the King of Spaine for reſtoring all things vnto there former eſtate, according to the French Kings deſire, yet cannot he attaine vnto it.
            And for Italy, it is true that the late King of Spaine in the yeare 1611, had made himſelfe Maſter of the Towne of Saſello, and placed a garriſon there: but vpon the complaint and requeſt of the Republique of Genoa, reſtored it to the former State. Neuertheleſſe in Monaco, and the Towne and Caſtle of Correggio, the Spaniards keepe a ſtrong Garriſon. They haue alſo newly erected the Fort of Sandonal, vpon the Frontier of Piedmont, towards Vercel. And concerning the Sates of Milan, Final, Plumbin, and other Fiefs which the King of Spaine holds of the Empire, he hath vpon the inſtance of his Ambaſſador reſident at Vienna, receiued

ſolemne inveſtiture thereof by the Emperour 1621; And beſides, the States of Venice and Savoy are threatned by him, aſwell for the miſunderſtanding and differences paſt, as for this new diſpute and quarrell touching the Valteline, wherein the greateſt part of the Potentares of Italie, and the Pope himſelfe are alſo intereſſed.
            And to make his way by little and little amongſt the leagues of the Switzers and Grizons, (peoples formerly ſo obliged and affectionate to the Crowne of France, as they did in a maner reiect all other Alliances) the Spaniard hath by money, promiſes and practiſes, divided them into Factions, thereby to weaken that body which ſubſiſts not but by their vnion, and to be able to bring them againſt France it ſelfe, and other neighbouring States. The Spaniards haue done aſmuch vnder divers pretents in the Countrie of Valey, and Biſhoprirke of Sion, having likewiſe poſſeſſed themſelues of the paſſages of Switzerland, thereby to haue the wayes free and cleere for their Armies to paſſe from Italie to Flanders: which before they were conſtrained to beg from the Duke of Savoy, or the leagues of Switzerland.
            
            To returne to Germany, it is very conſiderable that the conqueſts made by the Duke of Bauaria, aſwell in the upper Palatinate which he hath gottē entirely into his poſſeſſion, as in the lower Palatinate, tend all of them to the advantage of the Houſe of Auſtria, this Prince being neere Allie, and obliged to that Houſe, by the tranſlation of the Electorate vpon his perſon, and other benefits lately received from

the Emperour. So that to fauour that Duke, in hope either to bring him into ſuſpition with the Emperour, or to draw profit from him againſt the haire, conſidering how ſtrictly they are all linked together in intereſt, and affection the one to the other: and in giuing ſuch a Councell, there muſt be want of integrity, or pure ignorance of the preſent State of the affaires of Germany. The like muſt be ſaid of the Children of the Marquis Edward Fortunate, to whom the Marquiſat of Baden hath beene lately adiudged by the Emperour, againſt and in prejudice of their Coſen the Marquis of Douelach, who is now turned out of it, which is an extent of land ſomewhat conſiderably betweene the Townes of Strasbourg and Baſle, on the one ſide, and the Palatinate and Dutchie of Wirtemberg on the other.
            They haue likewiſe ſince a few Moneths poſſeſt themſelues of a good part of the Langrauiat of Heſſen, vnder colour of a ſentence giuen by the Emperour, in fauour of the Langraue Louis of Darmſtat, againſt his Coſen the Langraue Maurice of Kaſsell, (an ancient Allie and confident of the Crowne of France) upon their difference touching the Towne of Marſpourg, and the countrey about it. And ſo by little and little they proceede, getting footing in the Prouinces of Germany, and oppreſſing the libertie of the Princes and Citties of the Empire: thereby to make it hereditary in their Houſe; as they doe the Kingdomes of Hungarie and Bohemia, (which thoſe peoples haue euermore maintained to be meerely Electiue.) together with the Provinces of Moravia, Sileſia, and Luſatia, incorporated to

the Kingdome of Bohemia, and newly reconquered by Armes and other meanes, to the great increaſing of the Houſe of Auſtria, and exceeding great aduantage of their deſignes.
            We will not ſpeake here of the Townes and Fortreſſes of Arache, Mamora, and others in the Kingdome of Fez, ſurpriſed or conquered by the Spaniard ſince a few yeares, becauſe they are far diſtant, and of leſſe conſideration to France. But touching the Fort of Grauelines, which they ſtill aduance, and will by ſnatches bring it to perfection: we muſt blame our ſelues if we ſuffer it. But it would be a farre worſe matter, if the Spaniard ſhould conclude the Treaty of Marriage with England, for the reaſons which euery man may vnderſtand; for if the onely Negotiation touching that Alliance, hath giuen the Spaniards time and meanes to ſubdue the beſt and greateſt part of all Germany: and to puſh their deſignes ſo forward; what other thing can be expected from the accompliſhment of the marriage, but that in the end we muſt receiue Law from the Conquerour, and ſo looſe the prerogatiue of this glorious title, anciently wonne by our Kings, of Protectors of the liberty of Germany, and which is more, of Arbiters of Chriſtendome: beſides the fruit which we ſee loſt before our eyes: of ſo many Millions employed ſince 100, or 120 yeares, to entertaine our Allies the Switzers and Grizons, and other our friends and confederates; And of the expence made at the ſiege of Iuliers, to put it into the poſſeſſion of the lawfull heires of the Houſe of Cleue, whom the Spaniards laboured to diſpoſſeſſe,

and to take it themſelues: as they haue now done 10 yeares afterwards. For which notwithſtanding, our ill-affected-Frenchmen haue profeſſed publike ioy, although this place was formerly deliuered to the late Mareſchall de la Chaſtre, generall of the Kings Army, being for the moſt part Catholicke.
            It muſt be alſo taken into conſideration, that the Spaniards who for 70 yeares hath by diuers writings continuall blamed our Treaties: which the Turke doth now himſelfe ſeeke that Alliance with much inſtance. The laſt from Conſtantinople beare, that one Antonio Barili, a Dominican Frier, who had bin there ſecretly twice before, was againe returned thither, with two others in his company: and that he hath been zealouſly ſeconded and aſſiſted in purſute of this peace, by the Emperours Miniſters that were then at the Port: and now lately by one Curtz, who for this end hath carried thither a good ſumme of money; of all which the Grand Vizier himſelfe, gaue aduertiſement to ſome Ambaſſadors reſident at the Port, and oppoſite to the Spaniſh Party, iudging his deſigne of the Emperor and King of Spaine to be for no other end, then by this Peace By a Peace with the Grand Signiour of the King of Spaine, would yearely ſaue the charge of 20 m. men kept in Garriſon, vpon the Coaſtes of Naples, Sicilie, Sardinia, and thoſe Iſlands, and of 60 Gallies, in which are of Souldiers and Slaues well nigh 20 m. more: All which great forces, the King of Spaine is forced with a vaſt expence, continually to maintaine for his owne ſafety and defence againſt the Turke. And it is conſiderable that this propoſition of Peace, is made in a time when the neceſſities of the Turkiſh affaires, in regard of the preſent Rebellions and diſordres in their Empire, threatning ruine, or at leaſt ſome notable alteration, might make the offer acceptable. And that for the ſaid reſpects, it could not for the preſent be either dangerous, or vnſafe for the King of Spaine; but would be of infinite aduantage to the progreſſe of his affaires in theſe parts, if ſo great forces as are now onely maintained for a meere defence, without attempting any thing, ſhould be drawne forth into an actiue employment. to haue the better meanes and leaſure to go through with

their buſineſſe and conqueſts in Europe: and by degrees make themſelues ſtrong enough to vndertake the Turke, and then carrie their Armes into the Leuant. And to this end it is their writers publiſh, that it is neceſſary there ſhould be but one vniuerſall and abſolute Monarch in Chriſtendome, and that it ſhould be the King of Spaine, who is the mighteſt, and who by their report hath the beſt mirited of the Apoſtolicke Sea, and of all Chriſtendome.
            For their pretences, either vpon France in generall, drawing a diſcent of the Princes of the houſe of Auſtria, in a direct line from Male to Male, from Meroue, Childeric, and other Kings of France of the firſt race called Merouingiens: thereby inferring that the Kingdome belongs to them. Or vpon the Prouinces of Burgundy and Brittany in particular; Theſe falſehoods haue beene lately ſolidly refuted by one of our moſt excellent and learned Antiquaries. And touching their pretences vnto other Kingdomes, and particularly to England, the care and refutation thereof is to be left to thoſe who haue moſt intereſt therein. The euidence of theſe pretences which haue been ſeconded by reall vnder takings and attemps, appeares ſufficiently in Hereras Hiſtory of Phillip the ſecond of Spaine, in Cabrera, and in Camille Borrell, his Booke touching the prerogatiue and dignity of the Catholicke King.
            Our France being therefore enuironed on all ſides with the Teritories and Dominions of the Spaniard, and Houſe of Auſtria, either of their ancient domaine, or new conqueſts, (which hath bin made in ſo ſhort a time, as it ſeemes a thing prodious)

this State hauing thereby loſt all its outworkes and bulwarkes: that is, the beſt and moſt powerfull friends and Allies: it ſeemes to be more then high time to awake out of this deepe and fatall Lethargie, whereinto our France is fallen by the diſaſtrous death of our great Henry, and ſeriouſly to looke to our conuerſation, by taking it into due conſideration, that if the Spaniard ſhould now picke a quarrell with vs, and aſſaile vs againe: as in the time of the league, when Phillip the ſecond would haue had this Crowne put vpon his Daughters head, in preiudice of our Salique Law: the paſſages by Land would on all ſides be ſhut vp againſt vs, ſo as we could not be relieued either with men or money from Germany, Switzerland, or Italie: as was our late King in his great neceſſities. And on the contrary, all the Princes and people ſubiect to the Spaniard, and thoſe whom he hath lately ſubdued vnto him, who were formerly our friends, and fauoured vs: will be conſtrained and bound to aſſiſt and and ſerue againſt vs, and many of them to their great griefe.
            Yet is it not meant that recourſe ſhould preſently be had vnto Armes, and the publique peace broken. as if ſo great a King in ſo powerfull a kingdome as this is, had no other meanes to protect the afflicted. The late King in the like caſe, without applying thoſe violent remedies, hath by his wiſedome ſufficiently ſhewed the way; as when by a ſerious interpoſition of his credit and authority, he accommodated the difference betweene the Pope and the Venetians: or when by his liberallity he ſuccoured

thoſe who beſought his helpe: or when by menaces, he gaue cauſe of apprehenſion to thoſe that would oppreſſe his friends and Allies. And theſe are the meanes that ought to be vſed in the firſt place, before the way of open force be taken; all warres how iuſt ſo euer, being both ruinous and hazardous.
            True it is that the peace of this State, the vnion and concord of the people in a due obedience to our King, and the conduct of a wiſe Councell, that knowes how to reſume the wiſe Councells and Maximes of Henry the great: and the former ſtate of a good intelligence, with the moſt ſincere friends and ancient confederats of this Crowne, are the firſt and principall remedies of this euill: yea, the ſupreame way for reſtoring this puiſſant and once flouriſhing Kingdome, to its ancient ſplendor, ſtrength, and authoritie.
            FINIS.
