               PEr multas tribulaciones oportet introire in regnum dei. ¶ Thus ſayth the apoſtole ſaynt Poule in the boke of actes and dedes / that is to ſaye in englyſſhe. By many trybulacōns we muſte entre in to ye kyngdome of god wherfore all thoſe whiche intende to com in to the kyngdome of heuen muſte pacyently take temporall trybulacyon. For that is the waye thyder by the ordynaūce of god. And thoſe yt moeſt pacyently take ther trybulacōn / they ſhall haue ther̄ mooſt conſolacyon. For ſay nt Poule ſayth in the ſeconde Epyſtle to the Corynthes. ¶ Sicut ſocu ſumus paſſionis. ſic erimus conſolacionis. ¶ That is to ſaye. Lyke as we are parteners in trybulacyons ſo ſhall we be parteners in Joye and conſolacyon. Thus trybulacyon is bytter / but the ende that hit bryngeth to is mooſt ſwete & delectable. And remē
               braūce of that euerlaſtynge ſwetenes maketh faythfull ſoules ſwetely to take mater of trybulacyon.
            Temporall aduerſyte & trouble profyteth no thynge to the rewarde of eternall Joye but yf it be pacyentely taken. Thus pacyence maketh trybulacyon profytable. And the profyte of temporall proſperyte cometh of the vertue of mekenes wherby proſperyte is lytel ſet by. The parfyte pacyente herte maketh moche of aduerſyte. And the parfyte meke herte ſetteth  lytell by temporall proſperyte / & lytell Joyeth therin but rather ſoroweth / bycauſe he fereth that he vſeth not parfeytly acordynge to the grete pleſure of god the goodes of this proſperyte. Yf thou aſke me why our lorde wyl gyue theſe temporall goodes to ſuche as he knoweth yt are wretched ſinners and vſe them euyl. I anſwere. One cauſe is to ſhewe his parfyte & habondāt goodneſſe whiche gyueth good thynges not only to ſuche as be good / but alſo to ſuche as are euyl & wretched ſynners. And to gyue vs example to folowe hym in doynge good for euyll / as he byddeth in the goſpell of Mathew. Loue your enemyes ſayth he / & do well to ſuche as do euyll to you and praye for ſuche as purſue you & ſpeke euyl of you. For ye doo thus than ye may knowe that ye are parfyte in vertue lyke as your fader in heuē is parfyte & maketh the ſonne to gyue lyght as well to the euyll men as to the good men. And maketh the vnryghtwyſſe men to haue profyte of the rayne as well as the ryghtwyſſe. And this is a grete comforte to take pacyently trybulacyon. For yf we wyll for the loue of god breke our one frowarde herte ād for to wynne ye loue of god & loue ſuche as trouble vs & praye for them / and do good ayenſt euyll / thā we haue one of the greteſt tokenes that we are parfyte in the ſyght of god as his owne children / and folowers of hym / whiche thynge yf we wyll remembre vs is moſt Joyfull to vs. Alſo it maketh vs more pacyent yf we duely remembre ye goodes that

we haue reſceyued of god / the goodes of nature / as wytte / eloquence / ſebleneſſe of bodye / helthe / beaute & goodes of fortune / as golde / ſyluer / clothe / lyuelode and how we haue myſpended them ſynfully / & how pacyently he hath ſuffred vs longe tyme to abyde in ſynne to the entent that fynaly remembryn ge his goodenes / his pacyence / & longe ſufferynge / we ſholde tourne to hym / wherfore whan he ſtowe geth vs yf we remembre how wel we haue deſerued hit we ſhall by his grace more parfytly be ayen hit. Our lorde gyued good thynges / as helthe / rycheſſe & proſperyte to euyll men & wymen / yt remembryng his kyndeneſſe they ſholde be the more moeued to penaunce & ſoryneſſe whan they ſee they haue offen ded ſo kynde a lorde whiche ſo gentelly calleth thē of his grete goodnes. And he ſendeth oftymes trybulacōn to good folk whiche are not parfytly goode for they take not thankefully trybulacōn / but ſome tyme grudge vnder the rodde of chaſtyſemēt wherfore he kepeth them ſtyll vnder the rodde tyll they be ſo acuſtomed therwith yt they can take it pacyently. Thus by his kyndeneſſe he bryngyth euyll folke to penaūce / and by his ſharpneſſe he bryngeth good folke to pacyence. Alſo he gyueth proſperyte and goodes of this worlde to good men and wymen to nouryſſhe them & cheryſhe them in his loue / lyke as the fader telleth the childe to folowe hym by a fayre appell / he ſendeth alſo trybulacōn to euyll folke to make them drede hym. And thus the good folke he

bryngeth to loue by worldely proſperyte. And euyll folke he bryngeth to drede by aduerſyte.
            ONe cauſe why our lorde wyll that good folke haue aduerſyte and trybulacyon is this / bycauſe that euyll folke ſhall not thynke that trybulacyon is ſo euyll that our lorde accepteth hit nought ne loueth them whiche hate hit for they ſee the contrarye that thoſe whiche be mooſt in vertue haue mooſt trybulacyon / as our ſauyour wiche neuer dyd ſynne hadde mooſt bytter payne and trouble. Alſo his bleſſyd moder / his apoſtles and his dyſcyples. And lyke wyſe now in theſe dayes ſuche folke as our lorde loueth beſte ſuche he ſendeth mooſt ſorowe in ther herte / and mooſt payne or labour in bodye / with the whiche in the begynnyng they grut che / but fynally they are taught to ſuffre hit ſwetly and to gyue thankynges to our lorde therof / whiche by trybulacyon delyuereth them from grete ſynne / and brnngeth theym to grete grace in this worlde / and ordeyneth for them plentefully the pleſure perpetually and glorye of the lyfe that is to come.
            ¶ He gyueth alſo the goodes of this lyfe to ſuche as be wretched and ſynfull lyuers after theyr owne wyll and not after the wyll and lawe of god / bycauſe that good men and wymen ſhal not ſet theyr herte to moche on theſe goodes which they ſee that wretched people haue with the hatred of god / but that they ſhall loue thoſe goodes mooſt whiche haue none but ſuche as be good / & are ſpecyaly beloued

of our lorde. And theſe are the goodes of vertue whiche brynge vs to the habondaūce rycheſſe of ye ryall empyre of heuen. The good ſoules ſet lytell by the vayne proſperyte of this worlde for hitis tranſytorye ād rather occaſyon of vyce than of vertue / and ſhey ſee that they are gyuen to theym only well to dyſpenſe & that they haue no lordſhyp in theym but only vſe & that they ſhall be ſtraytely examyned ād gyue acounte how they haue vſed them / and by the ryghtfull Jugemēt of god they ſhall haue grete punyſſhement in this lyfe or after this lyfe for euery thynge yt they myſpende / wherfore theſe faythfull ſoules haue more fere than fauour / more payn thā pleſure in grete poſſeſſyon of worldely goodes / they are not inflate ne exalte in themſelfe by pryde in proſperyte. For amonge grete poſſeſſyon of worldely & bodely goodes they fynde themſelfe ryght poore in the gooſtly goodes / wherfore yf the worldely proſpe ryte rycheſſes & honours be taken fro them they are not caſte downe by ſorowe / for they knowe that our lorde hath lent it theym only as longe as it pleſeth hym / wherfore whan the worldely goodes goo they thynke it is of his ordynaūce whiche ordeyneth euery thynge to the beſte to ſuche ſoules as are wyllynge to lyue accordynge to his wyll with an obedyent herte / theſe knowe that it is for the beſte that he taketh them awaye & therfore they blyſſe hym / wherfore loſſe of worldly ꝓſperyte troubled lytel ye ſoules of good folke / ye ſynful folke thynke yt they are very

lordes of temporall goodes / & that they may ſpende them after ther owne pleſure hauynge lytell regarde or none to the wyll of god. And in theſe goodes they put they mooſt felycyte and pleaſure / wherefore they be hyghe and proude in poſſeſſyon of theſe and in loſſe of them they are caſte downe in to grete ſorowe and payne / and the more ſorowe they haue in loſſe of theym / the more corrupte and vycyous loue they hadde in hauynge of them. Our lorde alſo gyueth wordely goodes to ſynfull folke / for yf he ſholde ſtryke euery ſynfull man & woman with the ſtroke of ſharpe trybulacyon as ſoone as they hadde ſynned / than they ſholde thyuky that all ſynne were punyſſhed in this lyfe / and that ther were no punyſſhement for ſynne ordeyned after this lyfe wherfore our lorde ſuffreth many one for to lyue in this lyfe after theyr owne pleſure / and to multeplye ſynne at ther pleſure ād to his grete dyſpleſure / hauynge no punyſſhement in this worlde by cauſe we ſhall vnderſtande yt it is reſerued to the other worlde / for god is ſo ryghtful that he may leue no ſynne vnpunyſſhed / wherfore 
                  •
               ythen theſe ſȳners are not punyſſhed in this worlde / ther muſte nede punyſſhement be done after this worlde. And hit ſhall be to harde to abyde ye trybulacōn / wherfore well is them that haue in this lyfe theyr trybulacyon / for this is lytell or nought in regarde of that. Alſo ſome ſynners in this lyfe haue grete trybulacōn & punyſſhement / and ſpecyally ſuche as be comonly knowen


of wretched lyuynge / & one cauſe is that other ſhal be aferde to folowe theym by example of lyuynge / and an other is that we may ſee in this lyf that god taketh grete dyſpleſure with the lyfe of ſuche as be wretched. yf he ſholde punyſſhe no ſynne in this lyfe / than hit ſholde be thought that he lytell forſed of the lyfe of man / ne gaue none attendaunce therto. Alſo yf he wolde gyue no temporall goodes to ſuche as aſke theym of hym hit ſholde ſeme that they were not in his power. And yf he ſholde gyue temporall goodes to echone that aſketh them vndſtandynge that they be ſoo gretly deſyred in this lyfe / the people wolde rather ſerue hym for goodes of this lyfe than for goodes of the lyfe to come / wherfore to ſome he gyueth proſperyte / and to ſome he gyueth aduerſyte Wherfore ſuche as aſke temporal proſperyte and reſceyue hit of our lorde they may ſee that he may gyue hit / but yf they ſet theyr herte more on hit than on the proſperyous lyfe to come / they ſhall neuer after this lyfe haue proſperyte but perpetuall trybulacyon and aduerſyte. Alſo ſuche as be louers of god and vertue and haue in this lyf payne and aduerſyte / our lorde hath ordeyned in ye lyfe to come to haue grete proſperyte. And ſuche as he ſeeth that ſholde be blyndeth with temporal proſſperyte / he ſendeth theym themporall aduerſyte / by cauſe that they ſholde lytell make of this lyfe where as they ſuffre ſo grete trybulacyon / and make moche of that lyfe wherby they ſhall reſceyue the grete

proſperyté of that flourynge felicite that neuer ſhal fade by aduerſyte / but euer be a lyke freſ he without ende in eternyte. Thus who ſo wyll haue that proſperyte they muſte take pacyently and thankefully this aduerſyte. For the profyte of payne and trybulacōn is in the maner of well takynge therof. The good theef and the euyll theef the whiche were crucefyed with our ſauyour ſuffred one maner of payne / but the good thef toke it faythfully and pacyently and therfore hit brought hym to the paradyſe The euyll theef toke hit not faythfully ne pacyentely and therfore hit nothynge dyde profyte to hym to delyuer hym fro ſynne and to procure grace for to brynge hym to glorye. Oftentyme the paynes that dyuerſe perſones ſuffre is lyke but the takynge of hit is not lyke / therfore one perſone is purged by payne and the other is broken and hurte therby / for that one taketh hit pacyently and thanketh god therof / and that other grutcheth therwith and forgeteth god / and ſo the payne that they 
                  •
               uffre is lyke / but the ſufferers are not lyke / for that one hath vertue with the payne / and that other hath vyce / lyke as in one fyer golde glyſtereth and the grene blocke ſmoketh / and vnder one fleyle the whete is purged and the chaf is broken / ſo one maner of payne or trybulacyon purgeth the pacyent / and fyleth and deſtroyeth the vnpacyent. The good man or good woman loueth and thanketh god therof for hit is his werke / and they praye to hym that hit may ſtande

theym for theyr purgatorye / for allmaner ſynet cometh of vyce / & al maner payne cometh of god to the more profyte of thoſe that deſyren to loue hym more than all the wytte of mortall man can telle / the euyll man or woman grutcheth with god and thynketh lytell what profyte yt he hath ordeyned to theym by payne & trybulacyon.
            THere is noo temporall payne that ony cryſten ſoule ſuffreth in this lyfe but they deſerue hit well and moche more both for offences that they doo in themſelfe and alſo ayenſt theyr neyghbours. There is noo man neyther noo woman the whiche lyueth ſoo Innocently and ſoo vertuouſely in this lyfe / but many tymes they offen de doynge not after ryght and reaſon / but after the euyll deſyre of theyr fleſſhe. Not with ſtandynge that by ſpecyall grace of oure lorde ther are full many the whiche lyue longe tyme without dedely ſynnes and doo noo grete myſcheuous dedes / for whiche myſcheuous dedes and for punyſſhement of yt whiche our lorde fulfylleth the worde with grete batayle / peſtylence / and grete hongre / and many grete trybulacyons / and yet they can not excuſe theym but they doo many venyall ſynnes the whiche deſerue more punyſſhemēt of the rygoure of ryghtwyſneſſe than ony that is felede in this lyfe. And yf it were ſo that ony man or woman lyued without ſynne of themſelfe / yet they lyue not without ſynne in dayly couerſacōn with theyr neyghbours / for

with theyr neyghbours they lyue not alwaye as thei ſholde do excytynge them to vertue by wordes and example. Alſo whan they here or ſee theym offende they correcte theym not as they ought to do by broderly charyte. For ſomtyme of ydelneſſe they wyll not ſtudye how they myght ſaye or do to the correc cyon of theyr neyghbour. And ſomtyme they are a ſhamed to ſpeke to theym ferynge that they ſholde be rebuked ayen / other in lyke thynges or in worſe / or for couetyſe that they fere yf they ſholde ſpeke they ſholde dyſpleſe / and by that they ſholde loſe ſuche thynges as they deſyre to haue or they ſholde loſe therby ſuche thynges as they haue. Neuertheleſſe euery man is not boūde to correcte other folke whan he ſeeth them offende / for peraduenture yf he ſpeke openly to hym amonges many he ſholde make hym worſe than he was byfore / wherfore yf his mynde gyue hym that he myght more profyte at an other tyme / than he may withoute ofence ceſe tyll ſuche a tyme that he thynke he ſholde more profyte. But euery man that ſeeth his neyghbour offende and demed in his mynde that by his ſpeche he myght reforme hym / he is bounde to ſpeke ta his reformacyon. And by cauſe they doo not ſoo notwithſtandynge they lyue vertuouſly to theym ſelfe / yet they deſerue to haue payne and trybulacyon accordynge to the ryghtwyſneſſe of almyghty god wherfore euery man ought pacyently to take trybulacyon for the ryght wyſneſſe of god wyll yt hit be ſo

for cauſes the whiche oftymes are knowen only to hym.
            TRybulacyon for hit ſelfe is not to be deſyred but for the profyte that groweth therof & for the ſpecyall helpe that the ſoule hath therby / for ye ſynfull ſoule is refourmed & reſtored to the loue of god by the well takynge of trybulacy on / wherfore that ſoule whiche hath offended god & wolde be glad to wynne his loue / agayne / hit may be glad whan he ſendeth hit trybulacyon & payne for therby they may wynne his loue. And for this cauſe ſayth the prophete Dauid. ¶ Da nobis dne auxiliū de tribulacione. ¶ Lorde helpe vs by trybulacyon / he ſayth not gyue vs trybulacyō / but gyue vs helpe by trybulacyon. As no man wyll deſyre a bytter drynke but only for the helpe that he may haue therby / yf he truſte that he may haue his bodely lyfe therby he wyll he ryght glad to drynke hit be hit neuer ſo bytter rather than he ſholde bodely dye Lyke wyſe a ſynful ſoule that hath deſerued eueria ſtynge deth ſholde be ryght glad to drynke a ſharpe draught of trybulacyon for to be delyuered ther by fro ye endeleſſe payne of euerlaſtynge deth. Thꝰ to wyſe folke in god whiche ordeyne all theyr lyfe pryncypally to god / tribulacyon deth grete profyte And to wyſe folke of the worlde that putte theyr mooſt pleſure in this worlde & lytell remembre the lyfe that is to come / trybulacyon doth grete hurte / for hit is ſo ſore ayenſt theyr wyll whiche our lorde

ſendeth to theyr helth & profyte to make theym ſet lytell by this worlde that our lorde is wroth with theym / & ſo by the dyſobedyent takynge of this temporal trybulaciō they deſerue to haue euerlaſtynge trybulacyōn. Thus euery man yf he wyll may haue grete helpe & profyte by trybulacyoon. And this god wyl: thou ſhalt haue the ſooner yf yu remembre how precyous this vertue of pacyence is in ye ſyght of god / and how profytable hit is to the ſoule without whiche no vertue pleaſeth god in the ne profyteth the. Than thynke that thou can loſe no bodely thynges whos loſſe is troublous to the / that is ſo profytable as pacyence whiche thou loſys yf thou take not eaſely thy trybulacōn. And ſo lerne to conforte thyſelfe within in that yu feleſt thyſelfe dyſcon forteth without / for yf thou take pacyently aduercyte and thynges done ayenſt thy wyll / thou getteſt more rycheſſe Inwardly in thy ſoule / than is poſſyble to the to loſe outwardly. And of all gladneſſe that is the mooſt precyous & acceptable to god the whiche groweth of trybulacōn & is one of ye mooſt gladneſſe yt yu can haue yt yu haſte an holy ſoule / but this gladneſſe none may haue but ſuche as knowe ye fruyte & profyte of trybulacōn whiche ye may lerne in parte by redynge of this treatyſe of trybulacōn / & ſpecyally yf ye emprynte well the ſentence therof in your mynde / for lyke as euyll chawed mete profyteth lytell nature / ſo lyght redynge with lytell at tendannce of the ſentence profyteth lytel the ſoule.
            
               
THere are. xx. fruytes the whiche cometh of trybulacyon well taken. The fyrſte is that trybulacyon well taken as the werke of our lorde to reformacyon of the ſoule / kepeth the good ſoule in the ſtate of grace fro the hondes of the enemyes therof / and hit reſcueth & delyuereth the euyll ſoule fro the enemyes. Theſe enemyes that are ſub preſſyd & dyſcōfet by trybulacōn / are ye fals Joyes of this worlde & dyſceyuable proſperytees of fleſſhely pleſure / whiche take as pryſoners ye hertes of mē & wymen that be without dyſcyplyne ād connynge of vertuous lyuynge to bataylle ryghte with theſe fleſſhely pleaſures / they are ſo dyſceyuable for they ſhewe as they were frēdes & they are enemyes / they ſhewe they wolde brynge to grete pleſure / but fynally they brynge to grete payne ſorowe & deſtruccyon Theſe are the enemyes that foles of this lyfe deſyre to be conuerſaunt withall / & they take theym not as enemyes / but as true frendes & helpers / they make ſoo fayre contenaūce & pretence of fauour / & yet they entende to kylle & deſtroye as Joab capteyn to the people of kyng Dauyd toke ye man Amas by ye chynne & laughed on hym as he had ben his frēde by cauſe he ſholde not haue hym ſuſpecte / and with that other hande he thurſt hym into the bely with a dagger. Thus whan worldly proſperyte laughed on a man yt he hath all thynges to his pleſure / than he ſtandeth in mooſt Jeopardy to loſe ye loue of god that is verry lyfe to the ſoule / for than he ſhall be

drawen to many vyces / & therfore proſperite is more to be drede than aduerſyte in that hit deſceyueth traytourſly / lyke as the enemye that hurteth ſecretly by dyſceyte is more to be drede that he yt aſſoyleth openly. Trybulacōn is not only in loſſe of goodes / loſſe of frendes / loſſe of helthe / loſſe of lyberte▪ but hit is alſo in loſſe of tranſquylyte & peas of mynde whiche a ſoule hath that is in grete temptacōn & batayll ayenſt the worlde / the fleſſhe / or the deuyll. Of all troubles hit is mooſt whan a ſoule is troubled to do a thynge contrarye to the pleſure of god whom hit deſyreth of all thynge to pleaſe. Trybulacōns are not only ſende fro god to thoſe that entende to ſerue & pleaſe god / but hymſelfe ledeth the ooſt of trybulacōns as captayne & marchall of the ooſt to ordeyne theym ſo wyſely that they ſhall be to the ſocour & reſcu of his frendes. And ſo he ſayth by the prophete. ¶ Cū
               
                  •
               p̄o ſum in trybulacione eripiam eū. ¶ I myn owne ſelfe ſayth oure lorde am wyth Hym that is troubled & I ſhall delyuer hym. And ſpecyally he is with theym in temptacōn & trybula cōn that put theyr pryncypaly hope of helpe in hym As he ſayth. ¶ Qm̄ in me ſperauit liberabo eum. ¶ By cauſe he hath truſteth in me ſayth oure lorde I ſhall delyuer hym. Than yu that haſte almyghty goddes helpe in thy trybulacōn & abydynge with ye to helpe the whan the trybulacōn doth aſſoyle the / reſorte than with harty deſyre to the preſence of thy lorde god / beſechynge hym for grace to take hit ſoo

that he may be pleaſed with the / & thou to haue ſpecyall helpe ayenſt thyn aduerſaryes by ye good takynge of trybulacyō & ſythen our lorde cometh to the tribulacōn / the more thy trybulacion groweth theby more nygh he draweth to ye. But perauētu re yu wylt ſaye here. Syr the preſēce of trybulacyō I fele / but the preſence of my lorde god whiche as the ꝓphete ſayth bereth me felyſhyp in trybulaciō I fele not / for yf he made me fele ioyfulneſſe of herte by his preſēce lyke as trybulaciō maketh me to fele bytterneſſe of herte. I ſholde be wel cōtent to ſuffre trybulaciō / & gladly I wolde reſceyue hit. Alſo an other thynge ſtoneth me gretly for byfore ye trybulacōn came / & thynges contrarye to my wyll I had more felynge in god & more pleſure as it ſemeth me than in ye tyme of trybulacōn. How is it thā that in tribulacōn he is more nygh to me & I leſſe fele hym / for a ſolucyon of this doubte yu ſhalt vnderſtande that yu haſte ye preſence of god where euer thou be / for ye preſēce of god his dyuynyte fulfylleth heuen & erthe as he ſayth by ye prophete Jeremye. ¶ Celum & terrā ego impleo. ¶ Wherfore thou ought to be ryght well auyſed in euery corner what thou dooſt or what thou ſayeſt for thou haſte thy▪ Juge preſent that ſhall dampne the or ſaue ye but ſpecyally he is preſēte with the whan thou art in his grace and groweſt in vertue. As whā thou feleſte that by grete temptacyon and trybulacyō thou ſetteſt leſſe by the worldely vanyte and by thy

life / and gyueſt the more to prayers / faſtynge / watchynge / almeſſe dede doynge / pylgremage goynge to redȳge of good bokes of vertue / of holy medytacyons / to haue thy mynde more conteyned to god with wyl to ſerue hym better / whā thou feleſt theſe profytes growe in the than thou feleſt our lorde goſtely. Theſe profytes our lorde maketh by tēptacyon and trybulacyon as ſaynt Poule ſayth. ¶ Be n

Thou wylt ſaye peraduenture that thou haſte hurte ſomtyme by trybulacyōs / for ſomtyme thou falleſt by temptacyon and loueſt vertue. I anſwe to this / that yf thou haue a wyll fynally to do well or wolde haue a wyll to do wel whiche is one of ye grete tokens thou ſhalt be the childe of ſaluacyon / than ſtandynge thou be ye electe and choſen childe of god / what ſomeuer happen to the thou ſhalt haue wele therby / not withſtandynge that thou dooſt dedely ſynne yet our lorde ſhall worke a weyle the vpon.

               m ꝓpoſitū vocati ſunt ſancti ¶ To ſuche as loue god all thynge retorneth to theyr weyle / and ſpecyally to ſuche as are the electe childern of god / or for ſuche as be the choſen chyldern of god after they haue fallē in to dedely ſynne / they fele in themſelfe rumours and bytterneſſe of conſyence / they wyll be cōfeſſed therof / thei ſette leſſe by themſelfe ſeynge they are but wretched

ſynnérs. They ſet leſſe by dygnytees and worſhyppes of this worlde / for they thynke thēſelfe be worthy to haue no worſhypes / but rather to haue grete ſhame & rebuke / they ſet leſſe by ryche reparell and clothynge. They ſet leſſe by coſtely and delycate fedȳnge of the bodye / for they thȳke they haue deſerued rather bodely payne than pleſure. Alſo ſeynge how they were brought to ſynne / they are more wyſe to auoyde ſuche occaſyons herafter. Alſo they loue god more that after theyr falle taketh them to grace ayen / and of very loue they drede more to offende hym. And thus many that falle toſynne come to more grace than ſome yt haue not ſuche falle lyke as Mary magdaleyn / in heuen aboue is māy that keped in this lyfe cōtynually theyr virgynyte I ſaye not this to gyue cōforte to ony ſoule for toſynne in hope that they ſhall come to more grace. For who cometh to ſuche grace & who not / it is not in themſelfe but in god. And not withſtandynge many come to ſuche grace after grete ſynne. Yet thoſe that contynue in Innocencye maye haue this grace and moche more in that that they are vel occupyed the tyme that the other were wretchedly occupyed by ſynne. And ſoo that tyme they wynne vpon theym that falle. Alſo our lorde is feled by conſolacyon and by comforte whiche he ſendeth ye tyme of trybulacyon. Many a ſoule is loſte without caunſeyll and conforte of man whiche our lorde of his grete mercy ſodaynly doth cōforte / that

they thynke for the tyme the trouble is cléne gone fro them. The apoſtle ſayth. ¶ Sicut paſſiōes xp̄i habundant in nobis. ſic ꝓ xp̄m habundat & conſolacio noſtra. ¶ Lyke as the paynes of cryſte habōde in vs / ſo habondeth in vs conſolacyon by hym ād ſuche as haue ſynned / whan they haue grace of tee res & wepynge for theyr ſynnes / with the ſame ryſeth a ſpyrytuell Joye in god yt whiche gyueth thē ſuche grace to be ſory for theyr ſȳnes. As ſaȳt Auſten ſayth / the ſynner ſoroweth for ſynne / & of his ſorowe he doth Joye. Euery ſoule that conteyneth in vertuous lyuynge ought to be cōtent though he fele no grete gooſtly ſwetneſſe / for comōly our lorde ſendeth hit to ſuche as he ſeeth are wek to bere grete labour and temptacyons / and by hit he comforteth them as by mylke the childe is nouryſſhed But ſuche as be myghtely growen in grace and in vertue he ſendeth them fedynge by bytter tēptacyons and trybularyōs / as ſaint Poule ſayth ¶ Perfecto
                  •
                eſt ſolidus cibus qui habēt ſenſus exercitatos ad diſcrecionē bom et mali. ¶ And the more a ſoule hath of gooſtly ſwetneſſe in this lyfe / ſo moche leſſer hit ſhallhaue in the lyfe to come. As he that taketh parte of his wageafore his terme daye the leſſe he ſhall receyue whan his terme daye cometh Suche oftētyme as our lorde loueth beſt / he ſendeth leſte gooſtly delectacyon but leueth thē only to theyr myghty fayth and by that to good werker of lyuynge. For in this lyfehe kepeth p̄uy his

loue bycauſe he wylle kepe them lowe yt they ſhall not make to moche of themſelfe. And yet to ſome whiche he loueth ſpecyally he ſendeth grete ſweteneſſe in gooſtly felynge of hym and by wondre reuelacyons. And oftentyme more to the profyte & to quyckē other to his ſeruyce & fayth whiche knowen not ſuche wondre workynges than to the profyte of themſelfe. But after this lyfe he wyl make openly knowen to all the worlde euery dede of vertue. And what grete tēptacyons they haue reſyſted for the loue of hym. He letteth not the troubled ſoule alway neyther oftentyme fele his preſence by gooſtly ſwetneſſe by cauſe he wyll kepe it lowe ād in fere / for the more lowe that a ſoule maketh himſelfe / and the leſſe that hit ſetteth by hymſelfe and thynketh that it is ſo wretched yt it is not worthy to haue ony gooſtly comforte of god / the more our lorde maketh of hym / and ye more glorye ād Joye theris ordeȳed to hym. For as he ſayth. ¶ Omnis qui ſe humiliat exaltabitur ¶ Euery perſone that meketh hymſelfe he ſhall be exalted. And thus many a ſoule groweth in vertue and lytell perceyued it as by ony gooſtly ſwetneſſe. But who ſo myght haue a lytell taſte of the parfyte delectacyon to the whiche he ſhall be brought by trybulacyon yf he take it well. He ſholde not complayne but Joye of tribulacyon. As ſaynt Poule ſayth? ¶ Gloriamur in ſpe filio
                  •
                dei et non ſolum in hoc ſed in tribulacione ſcientes qm̄ tribulacio pacienciā operat̄. pacientia

probacionē probacio ſpem ſpes autem non confundit quia caritas dei diffuſa eſt in cordibꝰ noſtris ¶ We Joye ſayth he not only that we hope to be the childe of god and Inherytours of his Joye / but we Joye alſo in trybulacyon / knowynge that tribulacyon maketh a pacyent herteyf it be well taken / and pacyence of herte is the grete profe that a perſone is the very choſen childe of eleccyon / and after that profe cometh hope of ſaluacyon / not as of our merytes but by the grace of god / whiche is yelded in to our hertes by the holy gooſt whiche is gyuē to vs. The grete comforte cometh not fro god to ſuche a tyme as the place be made redy for hit in the ſoule / and the herberers whiche take ād dreſſe this lodgynge are trybulacyons / as it is wryten in the booke of Thobye. ¶ Poſt lacrimacionem et fletū exultacionē infundis ¶ After trybulacyon and we pynge thou ſendeſt comforte and Joye. Than yf thou haue grete labours and beſyneſſe with theſe herberers thynke hit well ſpente for they wyll quy te hit one of theſe dayes. And grete trybulacyon maketh rome and place for grette Joyes / hit is decreed and determined as alawe by the grete wyſedome of god / that fyrſte he ſhall come to his dere beloued children with trybulacyon to delyuer them fro the falſe Joyes of this worlde / ād after he ſhal dwelle with them by true Joye where as they ſhal haue no nede of trybulacyō for to exclude the falſe Joye s. But afore that he come with very true Joye

he wyll make the herte by trybulacyon and temptacyon to ſette nought by all ye falſe Joyes of this worlde. Whan as trybulacyon is paſſed and hath made an holy place by pacyence and by mekeneſſe than cometh in Joye. But peraduenture thou complayneſt and ſayeſt. Syr it is longe or this conſolacyon cometh. A this is the complaynte of louers / what thinge ſoo euer hit is that is gretely beloued the deferrynge therof is paynfull. And not withſtandynge that yf hit be neuer ſoo ſharpely haſted yet hit is thought very longe in comynge. As Salomon ſayth. ¶ Spes que differtur affligit animā. ¶ Whan as a man hath hope for to haue a thynge that he loueth the deferrynge of hit is bytter to the ſoule. Alſo peraduenture thou wyll reſon to me thys. Syr I meruayll not that wretched mē and wymen whiche ſet all theyr herte & pleſure in wretched lyuynge / and ſpende ther tyme not profytabli but occupye all about ſynnes and vanytees of this worlde / thoughe theſe haue trybulacyon & ſee ye try bulacōn is profytable to them whiche are fallen in the hondes of theyr enemyes / as theſe be to drawe them fro ther hondes and make them flee ſynne & wretched lyuynge. But to ſuche as lyue holyly and do no grete ſynne. I meruayll why theſe haue grete trybulacyō / for they falle not ſo in the hondes of theyrenemyes as the other do. To this I anſwere that our lorde delyuered from the falſe Joyes of this worlde bothe ſynners and alſo the Innocentes

whiche ſholde be taken with them except his grace preuoked them by trybulacyon and temptacyon / & preſerued them fro theſe falſe ſynfull Joyes / alſo an other wyſe our lorde reſcues his enemyes and other wyſe his frendes. For he reſcues his enemyes fro trybulacyon delyuerynge them whan they are taken of theyr enemyes. But his frendes he delyuereth ſendynge them helpe by trybulacyons that they come not in to the handes of theyr enemyes. And ſoo bothe are holden to laude and to thanke god bothe the ſynfull whiche by pacyence and grete trybulacyon is drawen fro ſynne to vertuously uynge and lytell ſettynge by all the falſe worldely Joye. And alſo the vertuous Innocente whiche is preſerued by temptacyon and trybulacion that hit is neuer blynded and deſceyued by that Joye. Thꝰ no man neyther woman may thynke that they be out of the loue of our lorde by trybulacyan / but rather thynke that they are ſpecyally beloued of hym the whiche ſendeth them trybulacyon to kepe or to delyuer them fro falſe deſceyuable pleſures of this worlde ād from the Inordynate and foule delytes of the fleſſhe. Theſe pleaſures are called falſe / for they are ful ſwete in the begynnynge but they ende with grete bytterneſſe and ſorowe. As Salomon ſayth ¶ Extrema gauditluctus occupat. ¶ The ende of wordely Joye is occupyed with wepynge and ſorowe. A thou wyſe gracyous man and womanbeware of this falſe worldely Joye / yt thou be not

brought to grete ſorowe therby. Thou ſeeſt hit is butlytell and after hit ſhall folowe ſorowe of Ineſtymable gretneſſe / hit is but ſhorte but it hath a longe tayle of ſorowe that neuerſhall haue ende. Hit is no hole Joye for hit is medled with ſorowe. As Salomon ſayth. ¶ Riſus dolore miſcebytur. ¶ The laughynge Joye of this worlde is medled with many maters of ſorynes. Thoſe whiche thou thynkeſt haue mooſt of worldely Joyes they haue moche ſorowe / trouble / and labour with them. They are ſoo bytter to a parfyte herte that felynge them ones vit wolde neuer haue them yf it myght haue them per petually. They go faſte awaye but the ſorowe that foloweth vpō them ſhal euer abyde. A this is a falſe Joye where is ſo lytel pleſure and ſo grete payne and goth ſoo ſwyftly awaye and neuer ſhall come ayen wherfore I exhorte you all whiche wolde haue ye loue of our lorde and contynue a vertuous ly fe that ye thankefully welcome trybulacyons as your defenders fro your grete enemyes / whiche tri bulacyons are ſende from our lorde as his knyght to defende you. And thynke that your expēſes made in them ſhall ſtande you in grete ſeruyce. And yf ye can not welcōe hertely theſe ſoudyoures of our lorde yet chyde not with them nor malynge not ayenſt them / for yf ye fyght with them ye fyght with your frēdes and that is a peryllous batayll where a man putteth noo dyfference betwixt his frende & his enemye. The Joyes of this worlde I ſaye are enemyes

to the ſoule & brynge hit to ſynne & perdycyon. Troubles of this worlde / ſekenes / & paȳe are frendes to the ſoule for they drawe hit from ſynne Wherfore yf thou hate thy frendes & loue thyn enemyes thou ſeeſt what Jeoperdy yu ſtandeſt in / wherfore ſaye welcome my frende trybulacyon / and fy of erthely Joye
            THe ſeconde conſolacyon and fruyte in trybulacyon is to remembre how the herte is cloſed vp fro vanytees wherby hit ſtoppeth the eeres of the ſoule ſoo that hit may not here the callynges and the mocyons of tēptacyon as other do whiche fele no trybulacyons. For in ſuche hertes as do floure in proſperyte / the vayne pleſure of the worlde doth kepe ther perleament at lyberte. And thoſe hertes gyue attendaunce and withſtudye applye them how they may atteyne to fulfyll the deſyres of worldly pleſures in makȳge of goodly bil dynge and of goodly facyons of clothes and to be well acompanyed with goodly ſeruauntes. And to gydre treſoure to be called ryche / and to come to honour and dygnyte / and to be moche ſet by / ād to be called fayre in face / and goodly in bodye. Theſe vayne and tranſytorye pleſures do ſo replenyſſhe & fulfyll the ſoule with ſuche mocyons that in maner hit forgeteth hymſelfe / both in tyme of prayer and whan hit ſholde be vertuouſly occupyed / hit is ſo a cuſtomed to take hede and attende to the ſpekynges of theſe deceyuable pleſures that in maner hit

hath noo pleſure to here thynges profytable to the pleſure of god & the perpetuall weyle of the ſoule. But whan trybulacyon cometh / all this vayne ſpeche ceſſeth as the mocyons of vayne pleſures are withdrawen. This is fygured & ſygnefyed in the boke of Job where hit is ſayd the tyme that he was in grete trybulacyon. ¶ Nemo loquebatur ei verbū videbant enim dolorem eius vehementem. ¶ The frendes that came to Job whan they ſee hym haue ſo grete payne and trybulacyon they ſpake no worde to hym. By theſe frendes are ſygnefyed ye tēptacyons of proſperite whiche make pretence by the pleſaunt ſemblaūce & cōtenaūce they ſhewe to the ſoule that they were very frendes and they are veri traytours for they ceſſe not tyll they haue brought the ſoule to moche ſorowe oftentymes in this worlde. And yf ther folowe no ſorowe and penaunce in this worlde ther foloweth dampnacyon with perpe tuall payne and tourment after this worlde in helle with the deuylles whiche mooſt labour to make the hertes mooſt to loue ye temporal proſperyte of this lyfe / and the worlde and the fleſſhe do helpe the deuyll to make the ſoule to ſet the loue in proſperyte of this lyfe whiche ſholde be fixed of the felicyte of the euerlaſtynge lyfe / for all ye tyme yt it ſhall abyde here is graūted hit to lerne to ſet lytel by the vayne Joyes & pleſures of this lyfe. For by the ordynaūe of god the leſſe hit ſetteth by the Joyes of this wor de the more hit ſhall haue of thoſe mooſt excellent

and eternall Joyes in heuen. what our lorde of his ſpecial grace ſēdeth trybulacōn. Theſe Joyes are lytell ſet by & therfore they dare not ſpeke leſte thei ſholde be forſaken for euer / and therfore as in this tyme they go awaye as aſtoned and a ſhamed. O than this trybulacyon is of grete auctoryte whiche ſtoppeth the mouth of ye vayn pleſures of the worlde. Than lecherye is ſet onlyde ſhe dare nor ſpekefor her ſpeche in that tyme is no thynge ſet by. Lyke wyſe glotonye & pryde / for as that tyme the herte delyteth nother in delyctable mete and drȳke ne in freſſhe clothes. Than the eyen of the ſoule whiche were blynded with proſperite that it nother ſee hymſelfe ne god / now they are opened and can dyſcerne that all is but wretchedneſſe in this worlde / & that theris no true loue but ye loue of god and vertue / and than it fereth god. And than hit called beſely for his helpe and maketh many a good purpoſe and promyſe to amende the lyfe and to do thynges to his pleſure. Thou ſhal vnderſtande her̄ that what maner of ſpekynges the temptacōns make in thy ſoule other by thoughtes or ymagynacōns contrarye to the ſoule whiche ſomtyme ſeme abhomynable and ſhamfull / fere thou no thynge as longe as thou anſwereſt not to them ſaynge ye be conſentynge but nay by dyſcentȳge of. For as longe as ye cōſentes not to ye thought be they neuer ſo erronꝰ or neuer ſo abhomynable they ſhall nothyng hurte the to the decreſſe of thy meryte. This is fygured

in the bokes of the kynges where kyng yſachy cō
               maūded yt people of Jeruſalem whiche ſtode vpō the walles of the cyte yt they ſholde not anſwere to the blaſphemꝰ ſpekȳges of Rapſaces whiche was marchall of ye ooſt of kȳg Senacheryb & ſeyde ſege to the cyte. But peraduēture yu wyll ſaye to me / ſir how ſhall I knowe yt I conſent not to my thoughtes. To this I anſwere / yt one tokē is yt yu conſē

And as for thoughtes cōtrarye to the fayth fere them not as longe as thy wyll is to byleue as the chirche of god byleueth. For thā ye fayth of the chirche is thy fayth / & after that thou ſhalt be taken & not after thy rennynge mynde. Thus ſythen trybulacōn putteth to ſylence the grete tēptacōns of this worlde yt they dare not come nygh the troubled ſoule / & openeth the eyen therof that hit may ſee hit ſelfe & god / and that the worldely proſperyte is but myſerye / ād maketh the ſoule to crye to god & kepeth hym in mynde. I coūſeyll the to make moche of aduerſyte whan hit cometh and thanke god therof. For he ſendeth euer to ye for thy

wele and more than thou can thynkē and for other cauſes than thy mynde is able to knowe / excepte ye haſte it by reuelacyon of hym.
            THe thyrde conſolacōn & comforte in trybulacōn is to remembre the profyte of trybulacōn in purgynge of the ſoule fro ſynne & wretcheneſſe. Here is to be vnderſtande yt ther are fyue maners of purgacyons whiche are remenbred in ſcrypture. One is of the bodye by medycynable drynke or by lettynge of blood / & that is other by ſtrykynge of the veyne or craſynge or cuttynge of the fleſſhe. The ſeconde is purgynge of metall ād that is other with the fyrelyke as golde is gurged / or by furbyſſhynge lyke as yron is purged. The thyrde is purginge of vynes & treſſe whan the ſuꝑfluous braūches are cutte awaye with a knyfe or with a ſawe. The fourth is the purgynge of ye corn fro the chafe with the fleyle. The fyfth is the purgynge of wyne whiche is purge with the preſſure. For the fyrſte purgacyon whiche is made by drȳke I ſaye our lorde gyueth to ye this drynke of trybulacyon to purge thyn herte fro corrupt humours of worldely & fleſſhely loue / for lyke as the bytter medycynable drynke purged the bodye / lyke wyſe trybulacyon purgeth the herte. wherfore dere beloued ſoule I praye the drynke hertely and with Joye in god in hope of thyn endeleſſe ſaluacōn. This drynke of trybulacyon which this ſouerayne pheſycyen gyueth to the. And knoweth beſte thyn complexyō
               
thyn Infyrmyte / and what drynke is mooſt profytable to the. And this gentyll pheſycyan for to comforte the in thy drynkynge / and for to ſhewe to the that he gyueth noo thynge to the but whiche is profytable. He hath begonne and dronken of this drynke to the by his mooſt paynfull and bytter paſſyon He dranke to the the mooſt byttereſt parte of this drynke / for his paynes were mooſt ſharpeſt as it is wryten in the booke of Trenos. ¶ Uidete ſi eſt dolor ſinulis ſicut dolor meus. ¶ See ye ſayth he / yt therbe ony payne lyke to my payne / hit paſſeth thy power to drynke ſoo bytter a draught as he began to the. And ſtandynge that he is thy fader and thy maker whiche gyueth to the this drynke and hath ſoo hertely begonnen to the hymſelfe / than thou mayſt well thynke that this drynke is very profytable to the / and for this profyte take it ſwetely. O thou worlde ſaye that yf the kyng of very loue dyd drynke to his ſeruante hit were a vylenous dedeto this ſeruaunt to caſte the cup downe whan the kinge offered hit hym. Lyke wyſe whā almyghty god gyueth the chaſtyſement by trybulacyon / and thou wolde not take hit but with a frowarde herte that is in the thou caſte hit awaye / ſoo moche thy dede is more vylenous ād oryble / as this kyng excedeth all other kynges / and his loue to the paſſeth all other loue / and yf thou take hit hertely of his honde ſo moche it is the more merytoryous to the / and to the grete honour and pleſure of hym. Wherfore

I counſeyll the whan he offereth to the ye cup that thou drynke it of all hertely yf it were ye bytternes of deth yt he dyd gyue the / for he hath dronkē that bytter draught hymſelfe for ye / whiche hadde noo thȳge to purge in hym. wherfore yu that art ful of many vnclene humurs and of gooſtly corrupcyō ought hertly to drynke this drȳke as yu loueſt thy ſaluacyon for the whiche this drynke is ſende the. And caſte hit not downe after the coūſeyll of Salomon there he ſayth. ¶ Fili diſciplinā dm̄ ne abicias. ¶ Childe caſte not awaye the dyſcyplȳe of punyſſhement whiche our lorde gyueth to the. For as he ſayth in an other place. ¶ Qui abicit diſciplinā infelix eſt. ¶ He that caſteth awaye chaſtyſynge is vnhappy. Thys bytter drynke our lorde gyueth to all his frendes to whom he hath ordeyned the ſwete drynke of his glorye after this lyfe. Of this drike he ſpeketh to ſaynt James and to ſaynt Johā whan he ſayd. Maye ye drynke the drynke that I ſhall drynke. Alle the martyrs haue dronken this drynke. Confeſſours & holy men & wymen whiche now are put in poſſeſſyon of ye endeleſſe & Joyfull kyngdom of heuen. Therfore ſayth the prophete. ¶ Calicē ſalutaris accipiam. ¶ I ſhall drynke the holſome drynke / & yf it be ſo bytter that thy ſtomake may not well awaye withall / than calle to our lorde that maketh & gyueth this drynke yt he wyll gyue thy power & tempre thy ſtomake & appetyte hertely to take it. wherfor it foloweth in ye ꝓphete

¶ Et nomē domini inuocabo. ¶ I ſhall calle the name of my lorde god.

As our ſauyour for our wele not only without chydynge or wepynge ſuffred the payne of his paſſyon but he wylfully offred himſelf therto. Somtyme the pheſycyan gyueth a good me dycyne to purge the bodye and hit

               oth no profyte.

For the humours are ſo harde and not dygeſted the the medycyne purged not ye nature from them. Lyke wyſe our lorde ſendeth trybulacyō / but the herte is harde without pacyence ād mekenes that hit nothynge profyteth. Lyke as the trybulacyō that our lorde ſende to kyng Pharao no thynge dyd profite to hym / for the more trouble he had the more proude / angre / and enuyous he was / and ſoo that thȳge whiche is gyuen of our lorde as medycyne to ye herte the euyll takynge therof tourneth hit to poyſon. ¶ An other purgacyon of the bodye is by lettynge of blood / & one maner is to let out the blood by the veyne / for lyke as the euyl blood corrūpeth the good blood / lyke wyſe

and ſatyſfaccōn that the true penytēt hath it may be nombred ynough trybulacyōs. An other meane to mynyſſhe blood is by garſynge & ventoſynge or boxynge / & ſoo as many trybulacyōs as yu haſte as many garſynges yu haſte / & ſo many ſtrokes are ſtry ken of thyn herte to purge hit.

Thus yf the herte be enflāmed with the fyre of loue of god hit ſhall the leſſe fele the greue of the ſtroke of trybulacyon. For yf the herte haue the loue of god it is content with his werkynge whiche in this worlde ſendeth trybulacyon to all thoſe that he loued / & or deyneth in the other worlde with hymſelfe to haue the grete conſolacōn / without this fyre of loue in a dyſobedyent herte the ſtrokes of trybulacyon they are full greuous & full of anguyſſhe & payne. For as ſaynt Auſten ſayth. ¶ Omnia ſena et immania leua ac facilia amor facit. ¶ All thynges whiche are ragens & fayle loue maketh lyght & eaſy to bere.
            Thus our lorde dyd enflāme the hertes of his apoſteles afore they ſuffred ye grete perſecucōn & tribu lacōn in prechynge of the fayth / he ſent to them the holy gooſt ye ſpyryte of loue in ſymylytude of fyre in token yt he had kyndeled the fyre of loue in their hertes. Thꝰ ſaynt Peter afore his herte was heted wt this loue he myght not bere ye worde of a womā
               
whiche called hym one of cryſtes dyſcyples / but af ter that he had receyued ye ſpyryte of loue he was glad to be called ſo & glad to ſuffre his fleſſhe to be garſed & wounded on the croſſe for ye grete loue yt he had to our ſauyour cryſte. This loue made hȳ ſo pacyent / that not only bytter wordes were ſwete to hym but alſo bytter ſtrokes. The grete loue & de ſyre yt he had to be with cryſte made hym glad to take trybulacyons / whiche he knewe was the waye to come to cryſte ¶ An other purgacōn is of metall as golde is purged in ye fyre & made more bryghter & is departed from other metall / ſo the fyre of trybu lacyon formeth the herte & maketh it more clene / & maketh to departe therfro roſty metall of ſȳne. In this fyre were the martyrs & ye confeſſours fyned & purged as it is wryten in the boke of wyſedome. ¶ Tan
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                aurū in fornace ꝓbauit electos dominꝰ. ¶ God hath ꝓued his electe childer by trybulaciō lyke as the golde is proued by the fyre. Here ye ſhal vnderſtande that lyke as of all metals golde is the mooſt p̄cyous / ſo leed is mooſt lytell in valdure / & yet ther may noo golde be well fyned without led. For the leed molten with the golde draweth to hym all the mater of corrupcōn fro the golde. Thus the good folke whiche are lykened to golde are purged by the euyll folke whiche are lykened to leed. For by grete Iniuryes & wronges yt they do to ye good folke in worde and dede they purge them fro ſinne for they take all the wronges done to them well,

And by the good takynge therof thynkynge they haue deſerued ſuche trouble & more and thanke god that ſendeth them ther purgatorye in this lyfe / thei growe in grace and in the grete fauour of our lorde And the wretched people yt wrōgfully trouble them & of a malycyous entent growe in the Indygnacōn of our lorde and indette of the grete payne whiche they ſhal paye after this mortal lyfe. Thus by perſecucyons of tyrauntes were crowned the martyrs An other wyſe trybulacyon purgeth the herte lyke as frobyſſhynge ſcoureth the yrone and lyke as the knyfe whiche lyeth and is not occupyed roſteth / and as the ſwerde whiche is not drawen out of the ſcaberde. So men and wymen whiche reſte in the pleſures of this lyfe and are not frobyſſhed with ſhar pe trybulacyon they loſe the bryghtneſſe of ther ſou le and waxe roſty by ſynne. And theyr ſoules are as abhomynable in the ſyght of god / as ther bodyes ar pleſaūt in the ſyght of man / wherfore thou that art a faythfull ſoule and ſeeſt thou may not haue thy pleſures in this worlde and in the lyfe that is to come alſo / grutche not gretly yf our lorde ſkoure thȳ haberton with trybulacōn and make the a bryght ſwerde to ſtryke the fendes by holy lyuynge & wylfull takynge of trybulacyon. For more payne thou canſt not do to the deuyll than to take payne pacyently / for than he is confoūded in the whan he can not by trybulacyon brynge ye to Inpacyēce / our lor de ſcoureth the to make the knowe thy ſelfe / and to

ſet lytell by thyſelfe / and to knowe hym and make moche of hym whiche by trybulacōn tamporal ſhal delyuer the from all trybulacyon eternall and bryn ge the to perpetuall conſolacyon. ¶ An other purgynge is as the gardener purgeth the vyne & other treſſe by cuttynge awaye of ſuperfluous braunches Of this purgacyon ſpeketh our ſauyour where he ſayth. ¶ Omnē palmitē in menon ferentem fructum purgabit eum. ¶ My fader ſhall purge euery braunche whiche is planted in me by fayth & bryngeth forth no fruyte of vertuous lyfe. By this vyne is vnderſtande the herte of man whiche is fulfylled with the humours of holy loue of god and of vertue and bryngeth forth grete fruyte to the comforte of many / lyke as the humour in the vyne maketh it to brynge forth fruyte. And lyke as the humour whan it is ſuperfluous and more than nede it is ſpedeth to moche in braunches without fruyte Lyke wyſe whan the ſuperflous loue habondeth in mannes herte of worldely vanitees and of fleſſhely pleſures hit withdraweth the fruyte of gooſtly lyuynge / than meruayle thou not ſythen the wyſe gardener wyll cutte awaye the ſuperfluous braunches whiche let the tree of theyr fruyte / yf thy lorde god whiche hath taken the cure of thyn herte cutte fro the with the ſharpe knyfe of trybulacyon all thoſe thynges whiche yu loues vaynely or ſhrewdly whiche let in yt ye goſtly fruyte of vertue & make ye humours of loue to contynue in his ꝓpre boūdes of thyn hert

and of ſuche thynges as are profitable to thy ſalua cyon / for he wyll not that thyn herte be to ferre dra wen fro hym / ne yt it ſprede by forayne & vnprofytable braūches of vaȳne & worldly thȳge. ¶ An other maner of purgacyon is lyke as the corne is purged fro the ſtrawe & the chafe by the ſtroke of the fleyle And as the ſtroke of the fleyle purgeth the corne / ly ke wyſe the ſtroke of trybulacyon purgeth ye herte And lyke as ye corne is made to departe fro ye ſtra we / lyke wyſe the herte is made to departe fro the grete loue of this worlde whiche ſholde ſtele the her te fro god were not the fleyle of trybulacyon. And this maketh them to loue god & gretly deſyre to be with hȳ ſeynge theſe worlde ſo vnſtable and ful of trybulacyon & payne. And for this conſideracyon ſayth the prophete. ¶ Ecce ego in flagella paratus ſum. ¶ Beholde I am redy to the fleyle. To this holy prophete purpoſed with a glad herte to bere the ſtroke with the fleyle of god. Than thou that wyll haue the grayne & corne of thyn herte purged / playne ye not of the ſtroke of trybulacyō / for yu can not be put in the garner of heuen ther none ſhal be put but ſuche corne as is purged with the fleyle of our lorde. And lyke as whā the corne is grene & not wel dryed than it braſteth vnder the fleyle & cleueth faſter to the chafe / alſo the hertes wiche are full of moyſture of fleſſhely pleſure & carnall affeccyons they braſte by vnpacyence vnder the fleyle & than the chare of ſynne cleueth faſter to thē. ¶ An other

wyſe trybulacōn purgeth the herte lyke as the preſ ſure purged the wyne / for lyke as the preſſure whiche ſtreyneth the reſyns maketh the wyne departe fro the foule groſſe mater of the dregges / lyke wyſe tēptacyons / perſecucōns / & trybulacōns of this lyf purgeth thyn hert fro ye foule luſtes & Inordynate affeccyons of this lyfe wherfore refuſe not the preſ ſure yf yu wyll be layde in to the ſeler. Thus the holy martyrs lefte theyr bodyes in ye preſſure & tourmentes & the ſoule as precyous wyne was tonned in to the ſeler of perdurable lyfe.
            THe fourth conſolacyon in tyme of trybulacōn is to remembre the profyte of cōnynge to ye whiche a man or a womā is brought therby / for of all connynges the mooſt neceſſary cō nynge is a man to knowe hymſelfe & his lorde god for yf he knowe hymſelfe wel he ſhal knowe a wret che & a ſynfull ſoule whiche hath grete nede of ye helpe of our lorde yf euer he ſhall be ye childe of ſal uacyon And yf he knowe hymſelfe well he ſhal ther by come to the knowlege of our lorde. For his myn de ſhall than be ſo moche vpon hym that he ſhall ſouke moche knowlege out of hym. To this know lege a man is brought by trybulacyō / for therby he ſhall be made to ſetlytell by the worlde & lytell by hymſelfe & the leſſe he ſetteth by hymſelfe the more clerely he ſhall ſee his owne defautes and the more parfytly knowe the goodneſſe of god & after yt the more he ſhall loue hym. For as ſaynt Auſten ſayth

The cyte of god / that is is to ſayé / an holy ſoule in whom our lorde dwelieth by grace it begynneth at the contempt & deſpyſyng of hymſelfe / & endeth at the loue of god. And the cyte of the deuyll begynneth at the 
                  〈1 span left blank〉
                & endeth at the 
                  〈1 span left blank〉
                Wherfore ſaynt Auſtē ſeynge the connynge that cometh by trybulacōn he begynneth his prayer in this wyſe. ¶ Nouerim me nouerim te. ¶ Lorde teche me to knowe myſelfe & to knowe the. And lyke as the ſtroke of the rodde maketh the ſcoler to bowe his necke & loke wel on his boke & to can wel his leſſon & to come ayen to ſuche knowlege as he hath forgeten / lyke wyſe grete trybulacyon maketh a ſoule to belowe to our lorde whiche is the grette mayſter & techer therof. And maketh it to loke well on the bo ke of contemplacyon / that is to ſaye / to remembre his goodneſſe & ther owne wretchedneſſe / to remembre the gyftes whiche it hath receyued of hym & the grete vnkyndeneſſe that it hath ſheweth to hym / ād the grete paynes whiche be ordeyned to hit for vnkyndeneſſe. And the grete Joye for the loue that it hath to god & kyndeneſſe. Alſo this rodde of trybulacyon maketh it can his leſſon well of vertuous ly uȳge / as to praye / to faſte / to watche / to gyue almes & to applye hit to all ſuche thynges wherby it truſteth to gete ſpecyall helpe of our lorde. And to good cuſtomes & condycyons whiche hit hath forgeten it maketh hit to put them in exercyſe ayen. And thus it maketh them to letne well the leſſon of ther ſaluacyon.

And therfore ſayth Salomon. ¶ Uirga et correctio tribuit ſapiēciā. ¶ The rodde & correccōn bryngeth the ſoule to wyſedom. The yonge childe whan it is put fyrſte to lernynge by the freyle & vnſtable dyſpoſycōn of the bodye that is meued to haue the eyen fro the booke & want only to loke about the walles & rather to pycke ſtrawes & to clatter to his felawes than to lerne the leſſon to his grete pro fyte / but whan the mayſter lyfteth the rodde to ſtryke hym / than he loketh vp to hym & ſayd he wyl amende & is ſory yt he laboured not better his leſſon. Lyke wyſe the frayle ſoule loketh downe to erthely thynges & vanytees of this lyfe / as to rycheſſes / ho nours / beaute of bodye / good appareyle in clothes & the ſpekynge of ſuche thynges mooſt delyteth hit. But whan the grete mayſter almyghty god lyfteth the rodde of trybulacyon that it ſeeth grete trouble is lyke to falle to hit than it lyfteth vp the eyen to hym & cryeth mercy for myſpendynge of tyme / and promyſeth it wyll amende. And with grete betynge at the laſte hit is brought to the booke and to lerne well the leſſon. Thus proſperyte cloſeth the eyen of the ſoule to god / ād the rodde of aduerſyte openeth them and maketh them to knowe hym. Wherfore ſayth the prophete. ¶ Cognoſcet̄ dn̄s iudicia faciens. ¶ Our lorde ſhall be knowen in makynge Jugement of punyſſhement & payne / ād thus many a ſoule to whom he ſendeth payne & trybulaciō in this mortall lyfe / he preſerueth them fro ye Jugemēt o

euerlaſtynge dampnacion Therfore ſayth the apoſtle. ¶ Cum iudicamur a deo corripimur ne cū hoc mūdo dāpnemur. ¶ whan the Jugemēt of god is ſhewed vpon vs by temporal paȳe for ſecrete cauſes that we knowe not / but his wyſedome knoweth whiche ſendeth payne to no man ne womā but for grete cauſe. Whan we are thus punyſſhed thā we are correcte by cauſe we ſhall not be dampned with this worlde / that is to ſaye with worldely folke whiche ſet ther hertes on the felycyte & pleſures of this worlde ſo gretely ye in maner they lytell remembre ne deſyre the pleſure yt is ordeȳed with god for the holy ſoules whiche are ye deſpyſers of this worldly felicyte. A woo woo many they be whiche haue lytel or none worldely trybulacyon / for moche ſorowe is ordeyned to them in tyme comynge & ſorowe perpetual except ye grete mercy of god / for ther is none yt lyueth ſo Innocētly in this lyf but they deſerue gre te paȳe both by cōmyſſyon of thynges whiche they ought to do & do them not. And alſo by cōmyſſyon of thynges whiche they ſholde not do & yet they do them. Wherfore yf they haue no punyſſhement in this lyfe / grete punyſſhement is ordeyned for them after this lyfe / & lacke of punyſſhement maketh ye ſoule that it forgeteth hymſelfe & god as it is ſayd byfore & lyke as it is reherſed in ye boke of Danyel that Nabugodonoſor the kyng of Aſſyrye was ſoo ferre drawen by worldely proſperite fro the knowle ge of god / that our lorde to the knowlege of Nabu

godonoſor & to ye ſyght of man chaūged him in to the ſymylytude of an oxe / &. vii. yere he was amon ge ye beſtes. But after this grete punyſſhemen the loked vp to henen with the ſyght of his ſoule aſkin ge mercy of god. And after that he was reſtored to his owne forme & dygnyte whiche he hadde afore. By gooſtly vndſtādynge thoſe folke lyft vp theyr eyen to heuen whiche haue theyr medytacyons to god & ordre theyr loue to hym and knowlege hym theyr ſouerayne lorde of whom deſcēdeth all their veyle & grace to ꝓceuere in vertuous lyuynge. For lyke as all flodes come of the ſee lyke wyſe all graces benefyces bodely & gooſtly come of god / & lyke as they retourne ayen to the ſee / ſo we ought to referre & ordre them all to hym & not pryncypally to our pleſure as the prophete ſayth. ¶ Quod de manu tua accepimꝰ hoc reddimꝰ tibi. ¶ That thynge that we haue taken of thyn honde that we gyue to the. Thus ſuche gyftes as we receyue of our lorde yf we ſpende them in the werkes of vertue & gyue them to the poore in the name of hym than we gyue hȳ them ayen / as he ſayth hymſelfe. ¶ Quicqd feciſtis vni ex minimis meis in noīe meo. michi fe ciſtis. ¶ What ſo euer ye doo to ony of the leſte in my name ye do that to me / wherfore ſuche as refer re & gyue the goodes that they reſceyue of our lorde to hȳ ayen they contynue the floodes of grace. For as they gyue to hym he is ſo lyberal that he cā not but gyue ayen ſuche thynges as he knoweth mooſt

expedyent to his louers. And yf the flood of his bō
               tyfulneſſe come not to hym ayen / than the flood of grace is ſtopped by our defau

               . For lyke as he is the begynnynge & endynge of all goodneſſe whiche cometh of him muſte be retorned fynally ayen. Thus by the dedes of thy lyfe yt confeſſys / & ſhewes yt ther is one god / & in theſe yt thankeſt hym & worſhypeſt hym. Many ther are whiche do the contrarye / as the apoſtle ſayth ad Titū. Ther are many whiche ſaye they knowe god but they denye hȳ in ther dedes of ther lyuynge / for theyr lyfe is abhoiable in the ſyght of god & they lyue wretchedly as folke that had no fayth / & rather as ye reprobate & deſpyſed enemyes of god than lyke vnto his childer & frendes. ¶ Mul ti fatent̄ ſe noſce dn̄m factis autē negāt cū ſint abhoīabiles & īcredibiles ad oē opus reprobi. ¶ Thou whiche haſt gyuen thy lorde god ayen ſuche goodes as yu haſt receyued of hym / at the houre of deth thou ſhalt be lyghtly delyuered of thy acoūte / for in this lyfe yu delyuereſt ye of theſe goodes yt yu haſt receyued of hym & pute them in his handes ayen. And therfore hit ſhall be ſayd to the in that houre lyke as it is wryten in the goſpell of Mathew. My truſty ſer uaūte thou haſte ben faythfull & true in fewe thynges that I dyd gyue the / now I ſhall make the lorde of many thynges entre into the Joye of thy lorde. Than thou that haſte myſpended the goodes of our lorde to thy pleſure contrarye to ye wyll of hym and contrarye to thy profyte / thou may be woo / for

harde acounte ſhall be layde ayenſt the. Wherfore yf thou amende the not thou ſhalt haue ſtrayt paſſage to thy ſaluacyon. wherfore yf our lorde ſende the trybulacyon for myſpēdynge vaynly the tyme of thy youth & of ſuche goodes as he hath ſent the in this he ſhewed that he wolde haue the ſaued / and that thou ſholde amende thy lyfe and ones begynne to loke vpwarde to thy mayſter for abuſe the / he is whiche ſtryketh the. Our lord whan he ſeeth that the rebelle hertes wyl not tourne to hym by kyndeneſſe whiche he ſheweth to them in his gyftes than he beteth them to make them come to hym by trybulacyon and ſharpeneſſe / and yet oftētymes they wyll not come to hym as he ſayth in the booke of yſaye. ¶ Populus non eſt reuerſus ad percuicentē ſe. ¶ The people tourne not to hym that beteth hem. For in ſekeneſſe ther mynde renneth more for helpe by man in pheſyke than it doth to his helpe / and whan wronges and Iniuryes be done to them they are redye to reuenge them ād to do one ſhrew de tourne for an other / and are not redye mercyfully to forgyue it for his ſake / that they myght obteyne forgyuenes of hym. And ſo vnderneth ye rodde of trybulacōu they come not to correccyō / for they loke not as they are boūde by the benefyce of their creacyon & redempcōn to kepe his cōmaūdemētes and holy coūſeyll in reformacyon of theyr lyuynge here yeſhal vnderſtāde that euery true louer hath his herte towarde his loue / and they drede to be of

gete of ther loue & they harte to bef orgete ther they loue. And thus our lorde whiche hath to vs loue vn meſurable hated to be forgete of vs. And whan we forgete hym he beteth vs & pulleth awaye from vs ſuche thynges as we mooſt loue in this worlde / as helth of bodye / frendes / wordely goodes. And oftē tymes he ſuffreth the good name & cōmendacyō to be pulled awaye fro ſuche as hath vayne glorye in the laude of name without grete deſeruynge by holy merytes of good lyuynge of ye laude of god. And ſo he maketh hem to calle on hym & to knowe hym by aduerſyte whiche forgete hym by proſperyte. Lyke as ye butteler of Pharo had forgete Joſeph whā he was comen to proſperite whiche expowned to hȳ his dreme to his grete ſolace & comforte whan he was in aduerſyte. And bycauſe that worldely proſſperyte brygeth a ſoule to forgetefulneſſe of god / our lorde whan he promyſed to ye people of Iſrael grete cytees with plente of rycheſſes / he warned hē afore that they ſholde not forgete hym ſaynge thꝰ ¶ Non obliuiſcaris dn̄i dei tui. ¶ See that yu in the tyme of thy grete proſperyte forgete not thy lorde god. And to ſhewe to the that he forgeteth not the / he ſayth hymſelfe yt he hath wryten the in his handes ¶ Nō obliuiſcartuin manibꝰ en

            And the myſuſynge of hem is cauſe of theyr damp nacōn. wherfore rycheſſe & dygnyte of this worlde are called in ſcrypture the gyfte of the lyfte honde / as Salomon wryteth. ¶ In ſiniſtra eius diuicie et gloria. ¶ Grete multitude of ryche folke at ye daye of Jugement ſhall ſtande at the lyfte honde of the Juge / & the poore at the ryght honde / yf yu ſhalt haue ony loue of our lorde for thy rycheſſe it is for the good / vſe of hem / that is to ſaye / by cauſe yu ſpēdeſt hem to his honour & releef of hym whiche haue lytell to helpe hemſelfe for the loue of hym. And euer in the tyme of proſperyte take ſome wylfull payne to remembre hym lyke as he hath gyuen example to the. For veryly lyke as bodely pleſure maketh the ſoule to forgete hymſelfe ād god / lyke wyſe bodely payne maketh it to remembre hymſelf & god. And this paynes is merytoryous whan it is pacyentely ſuffred / but it is of a meruayloꝰ grete meryte whan it is taken Joyfully & as a remedye to purge the ſoule fro ſynne & brynge it to ſpecyall grace ād loue of our lorde / whiche peraduenture yu ſaye / ſyr I meruayle not yf our lorde with the rodde of trybulacōn bete the frowarde & vngentyl hertes whiche knowe▪

To this I anſwere / this betyng is not only profytable to ſuche as be vnkynde ād of ſynfull lyuynge / but alſo to ſuche as be good & vertuous whiche be not yet comen to the grete perfeccy on of vertue to ſuche tyme as they be made perfyte by reſyſtynge of grete temptacōn & gladly takyng of trybulacyon. For many ſoules whiche truſte that they be ſtronge to reſyſte temptacōn before they fele it / whan it cometh vpon them ferſely they fele them ſelf ryght feble in comparyſon as they truſted they had ben. But by contynuall betynge of temptacyon they come to grete myght of vertue & knowlege of themſelfe / and of what valoure they be in vertue. Therfore ſayth Salomon. ¶ Qui non eſt temptatus quid ſcit ¶ He or ſhe that hath no grete temptacyon what can they / as who ſayth ryght lytell. And thus our lorde ſuffreth ryght mercyfull and gentyl hertes to hym to ſuffre grete temptacōn / for in that they lerne to loue god. For of all proues of loue the gretteſt is whan a ſoule reſyſteth myghtely ayenſt grete temptacyons for the loue of god / and bycauſe they wolde not offende his grace. And ſo they make a myghty conqueſt of themſelfe and doo ayenſt theyr owne Inclynacōn to preferre the wyll of god ayenſt theyr owne wyl and deſyre. That holy man Job was brought to grete perfeccyon by aduerſyte And Salomon that was ſoo wyſe was brought to

grete folyſſheneſſe and vnclene lyuynge by proſperyte. Here is example that bodely aduerſyte bryngeth the ſoule to gooſtly proſperyte whiche ſtandeth in gooſtly wyſedom and vertue. And the bodely proſperyte begȳneth to gooſtly folyſſheneſſe and loſſe of vertue and fynally to euerlaſtȳge aduerſyte payne & trybulacōn. And ther is no ſoule ſo gracyouſly dyſpoſed but it wolde rather choſe with temporall aduerſyte to haue the gooſtly rycheſſe with the loue of god in this lyfe / and after it be paſſed hens ende leſſe Joye and fely
                  •
               yte / than with temporall proſperyte gooſtly pouerte with hatred of god & perpetual dampnacōn. Sythen Salomon that was ſoo wyſe loſte wyſedom in proſperyte / yu art not ſure yt yu ſhalt kepe thy wyſedom in wordely pleſures & proſperyte / than arme the to trybulacyon yf yu wylt come to ony perfeccōn. And whan yu thynkeſt the trybulacōn paynfull & heuy to bere / comforte the ayen with remembraunce that it is but ſhort & ſhall brynge the Joyfully out of the worlde / ſor thy laſte daye ſhalbe the ende of thy trouble for euer / & thynke that our lorde calleth the to hym therby where thou ſhalt ſee hym in his mageſte and be replenyſſhed wyth the ſolacions ſyght of his pardurable glorye. And thynke veryly that he whyche puttyth the to thys greate proof ordeyneth grete thynges for the. For lyke as the knyght getteth not of hys kyng to ſuche tyme yt he be proued in actes of cheualerye & haue myghtely foghten for his kynge / ſoo loke thou for noo grete

tewarde of god except thou haue grete temptacyon for his ſake / other ayenſt the deuyll by gooſtly temp tacyon or ayenſt thy fleſſhe with temptacōn of glotonye ſlouth or lecherye / or ayenſt ye worlde with co uetyſe. But of all thoſe batayles the gooſtly batayl in fayth & conſyens is mooſt troublous & heuy to bere / & of all other it is mooſt profytable to that ſou le whiche wyl fyght in this batayll is mooſt dyrect ayenſt the deuyll / and the conqueſt of hym is mooſt pryncypall as ſaynt Poule ſayth. ¶ Nemo coronabi

                niſi qui legittime certauerit. ¶ Ther ſhall none be crowned but ſuche as lawfully fygureth and pre uayleth by kepynge of ther ſoule fro conſent to ſyn ne. And the more dygnyte that a knyght or a clerke is call dto the more profe to be made before of his habylyte. Thus by theſe techynges thou mayſt vnderſtande that trybulacyon is ordeyned of god in this lyfe to calle the & lede the ayen in to knowlege of thyſelf & in to remembraūce of thyn owne herte. And knowe yu veryly that the herte whiche hath not caſte out of hymſelfe the Joye of worldely proſperyte / may not parfytly fele ne knowe hymſelf For the pleſure of this falſe Joye ſoo inchothes the herte that it may not retourne in to hymſelfe / but it is al occupyed with worldely maters whiche in that it may not / it ordeyneth to the increace of this vayne Joye / & ſo it laboureth euer more & more to blynde hymſelf as longe as it renneth outwarde in worldely proſperyte / & therof complayneth hym the prophete

Dauid in the perſone of aſynner where as he ſayth. Lumen oculo

Lyke as euery man is mooſt nyghe hymſelfe ſo vnder god he ought mooſt to loue hymſelfe / & in ordre to thoſe thynges whiche ſhal be mooſt to the auayle of hymſelfe as to god & vertue / and nothynge is ſo neſſarye to be knowen of man as hymſelfe. For all knowlege without knowlege of hymſelfe is but vayne to brynge a man to the ende that he was made fore / and lyke as he that hath not hymſelfe hath nothynge / for yf a man haue no parfyte power to rule hymſelfe no thynge is well ruled that cometh in his handes. For ther is no outwarde dede well ruled except it come of a well ruled ſoule / for the goodneſſe of the outwarde dede preſuppoſeth the goodneſſe of the good dede of the wyll Inwarde / & ſo yf yu haue not a good wyll ther is no thynge good that yu dooſt. But peraduenture yu wylt ſaye than yu dooſt neuer no good dede. For comonly whan yu haſte wyll to doony good dede ther cometh in thy mynde ſome ſhrewde entente / as vay ne glorye & laude of the worlde or to haue a temporall

profyte therby / or to pleſe thy frende or for fere to dyſpleſe hym / or of enemyte yu dooſt to the rebuke of other whiche do not ſee lyke as yu dooſt. Or yu leueſt thynges vndone by cauſe yu woldeſt not yt other ſholde folowe the. Thus comonly thy wyll is not good / and than after this doctrine thy wyll is not good. Here I anſwere yt it is vnpoſſyble to the to let ſuche though
                  •
                to come to thy mynde. But as longe as yu wolde do ony good thynges for ye loue of god & profyte of thy ſoule yf yt vayne or euyll thought we re awaye than yu doſt it pryncypaly for god / & yt euyl or vayne thought letteth no thynge the meryte of thy dede. As thus perauenture yu ſeeſt a poore man & wolde gyue a peny in almeſſe to hym / & forth with cometh in thy mynde yt yu ſhalt haue a laude of the worlde therfore or ſuche as ſee ye / this thought ſhal not make the to leſe thy meryte as longe as yu wolde gyue yt peny to the poore man for the loue of god yf no man ſholde ſee the than yu doſt it pryncypally for god / this wyll is merytoryous & ye dede folowynge therupon. Than retornyng to my ſaynge before lyke as he whiche hath not hymſelfe hath no thynge. Lyke wyſe he yt knoweth not hymſelfe knoweth no thynge / that is to ſaye / profytable to hymſelfe / as to purcheſſe the rewarde of our lorde in the euerlaſtynge Joye after this mortal lyfe. The wretched man or woman that fixeth ther loue mooſt on this worldely proſperyte he forgeteth hymſelfe for he is not with hymſelfe. Loke what thynge ye ſoule mooſt

loueth ther it is mooſt by conuerſacyon of the mynde / and the werkers of the ſoule mooſt renne thyder As our ſauyour ſayth. ¶ Ubi theſaurus tuus ibi cortuū. ¶ Loke where that thynge is that yu loueſt ther is thyn herte. Thus the herte of the couetous man is with his golde and ſyluer. The herte of the leche rous man is with the perſone there he hath mooſt fleſſ hely pleſure to. The herte of the proude man is there he hath mooſt reuerence and with his freſſhe clothes Thus the worldely proſperyte & falſe tranſytorye Joye in hertely creatures draweth the herte of men and woymē fro themſelfe / and with moche ſorowe oftentymes they come to ſuche thynges as they loue / and therfore they by them with leſſe labour & ſorowe they myght bye grete excellent Joye in heuen / than they bye this falte worldely Joye the whiche haſtely they ſhall leſe and than they ſhall haue euerlaſtynge ſorowe. But lyke as a man that is beſyeged whan he wolde eſchewe and goo out of his houſe he is compelled to retorne and is betyn in ayen by ſuche as haue beſyeged hym and is broughte therto that he dare not ones ſette out his fote at the dore. Lyke wyſe our lorde of hys grete mercy ſen deth the ſoudyoures of trybulacyon to ſuche ſoules and hertes as he loueth and wolde that they ſholde abyde at home and beteth them in to themſelfe / ād the more trybulacyons ther are and alſo the more they be ſo moche ye hertes haue leſſe power to ſtroye abrode from themſelfe. Than thanke god theroſ

whiche ſendeth the aduerſyte wherby thou art made to leue the loue yt yu haſte to worldely proſperyte & lerne to knowe & to loue god ād thyſelfe in ordre to god & thus to abyde at home and kepe well ordred the loue of thy ſoule. For whan ther is noo dweller in an houſe ſoone it falleth to ruyne & dekaye. Lyke wyſe the ſoules whiche are not Inhabyte in this maner falle to waſte & come to nought. Blyſſed is that man or woman whiche abydeth in hymſelfe & lerneth to knowe hymſelfe how they ſhal kepe ther bodye obedyent to theyr ſoule / & theyr ſoule obedyent to god. And aboue all thynge attendeth to kepe hymſelfe that the fleſſhe drawe not the ſoule to the loue of the worlde / but that the ſoule drawe the fleſſhe to the ſeruyce of god / and hath the grete Joye in the clereneſſe of conſcyence / is whan it lyueth without rumours in his conſcyence of dedely ſynne as it is comonly ſayd. A clene herte a Joyfull herte. And ſorowfull may that herte be that is lykened to a comon mynſtrell or a Jogular whiche is more in other mennes houſes than in his owne. And whan he ſyngeth & maketh mooſt myrthe in other mennes houſes than ſoone after he is mooſt ſorowe in his owne houſe. Lyke wyſe the herte whiche mooſt ſeketh ſolace in worldely thynges outwarde / hit hath leſſe Joye of gooſtly thynges Inwarde. A than I ſaye to the whiche feleſt thyn herte fro the in delectacōns of the fleſſhe or pleſures of the worlde / & than thou haſte ſuche pleſure to abyde there that thou haſt nowyl

to come home & to forſake hym vtterly whiche thou ſeeſt are not to the profyte of thy ſoule / than calle to our lorde that he wyll ſende his ſoudyoures of trybulacōn & dryue the home ayen & to conſtrayne thyn herte to knowe thy ſelfe & to attende wyſely in kepynge of thyſelfe that yu do no thynge contrarye to the wyll of god & to thyn euerlaſtynge auayle / as ye poore mynſtrell is conſtrayned to torne ayen to his houſe whan the feſtes are done / for than he hath none other place for to torne to. Soo after all wordely pleſure whan it is paſte & trybulacyon make ye not to torne afore yu ſhalt torne home to the houſe of thyn herte & yu ſhalt fynde ther a ſorowful houſe. For euery vayne Joye yt yu haſte had in this lif yu ſhalt fynde there a grete ſorowe / yetād yu take to the trybulacōn of penaūce afore yu departe fro this worlde it ſhall kepe the houſe of thyn herte fro the mooſt ſharpe brennynge fyre of helle / for as the prophete ſayth. ¶ Contritū et humiliatū deus non deſpicies. ¶ Good lorde yu deſpyſeſt not an herte whiche is meked & brought to knowe hem ſelfe by trybulacōn. Than yu whiche loueſt euerlaſtynge conſolacyon & feleſt thyn hert is ronne to vayne delectaciō praye trybulacyon to come & retorne the home ayen Lyke as the douue conſtrayned torned to the ſhyp of Noe bycauſe ſhe coude fynde no grounde to ſett her fete vpon. Noe is as moche to ſaye in our langage as reſt / the ſhyp is ye herte / ye douue is ye loue pray god yt ye flood of trybulacōn ſo couer all vayne thynges

fro thy loue that it be conſtrayned to retorne to Inwardly reſt of thyn herte by tranquyllyte & p̄ſſe of a clene conſyence & holy occupyenge of thyn herte with holy medytacōns of god & of vertue wt perfyte deſyre of good werkes & blyſſed cuſtomes to ye pleſure of god & thy grete promocōn. Thou that ſekeſt reſte in worldely thynges yu art deceyued / for yu ſhalt fynde no reſte but in god for none other thynge may ſacyate & content the ſoule but god / he ſhall fulfylle the deſyre of thy ſoule as the prophete ſayth ¶ Saciabor cū apparuerit glia tua. ¶ I ſhall ſacyate & replenyſſhe with Joye whan I ſhall ſee the good lorde in thy glorye. Therfore it is wryten in Eccleſiaſtice. ¶ In oībꝰ requiē q̄ſiui et ī hereditate dn̄i morabor. ¶ I haue ſought reſte in all thynges & now I ſhall dwelle in the herytage of god / yt is to ſaye / myn herte ſhal dwelle in deſyre of ye kyngdom of heuen where is ye perfyte reſte / therfore ſayth dauyd to our lorde ¶ Cōuertere aīa mea in requiē tuā. ¶ Torne myn herte in to thy reſte. The ſoule of man may fynde no ſuche reſt in the thynges of this worlde as in themſelfe whan it is ordred in ye lyuynge accordyng to ye lawes of god & ſuche a ſoule doth reſte for it is content in all thynges wt ye werkynge of our lorde & yt ſoule is the dwellynge place of our lorde of whom it is wryten. ¶ In pace factꝰ ē locus eius. ¶ His place is made where is peas / & peas of conſcyence is his peas for yt cometh of hym. Therfore ſayth the prophete. ¶ Conuertere aīa mea in requiē
               
tuā. ¶ Torne my ſoule in to thy reſte / & Salomon ſayth ¶ Intrans in domū meā conquieſcā cū ea. ¶ I entrynge in to the houſe of my conſcyence ther I ſhal reſte. Than yu may be wo whiche ſekeſt reſte in outwarde thynges & lokeſt lytel for the reſte of thy houſe at home in thy conſcyence. Yf yu wolde take labour to retorne home and well ſerche the houſe of thy conſyence / thou whiche art a grete louer of the worlde yu ſhalt fynde there a troubelous houſe / wherfore to ſuche as be the renners out our lorde ſayth by the prophete Mychee. ¶ Hiis qi forisſūt dicet̄ ve ve. ¶ To theſe that more are occupyed with other thynges than with hymſelfe hit ſhall be ſayd wo wo be to you / that is to ſaye / thoſe whiche haue ther herte ſoo ſet of outwarde thynges yt they forgete themſelfe / & ſpecyally yt herte hath cauſe to be wo whiche is departed fro themſelfe & ſytteth ſo faſte in worldely vanytees & in maner it is ſo faſte holden wt theſe vanytees as wt an ooſt of enemyes yt it can not torne ayen home to themſelfe. Euery worldely pleſure yt apereth outwarde it is a ſnare to rye it faſte & kepe it fro thēſelfe / wherfor euery ſoule remēbre wel hȳſelfe & ſee whereit ſett yt loue yf ye loue be fixed on ony thyng whiche god wolde not it ſholde loue than it is taken in a ſnare of dāpnacyon axcept it haue helpe of delyueraunce by the grace of our lorde wherfore it muſte dayely crye for helpe to hȳ to ſuche tyme he haue loued it The loue alſo of euery creature whiche is more than it ought to be is

a ſnare therto / wherfore it muſte beſeche god yt it may loue no thynges but ſuche as are good / & alſo that it may loue good thynges in ordre to god and profyte of the ſoule. To an herte that hath not ſet the loue on the vanytees of the worlde it is lytel dyf fyculte to kepe hem out of the herte / but whā they haue ones taken ther lodgynge in the herte by that loue that the herte hath to them without grete labour & dylygence they wyll not be dryuen out ayen And oftentyme whan our lorde ſayth that it is not expedyent to ſuche as he loueth that theſe vanytees abyde in the herte & alſo he ſeeth yt the perſone that he loueth helpeth not hymſelfe to dryue hym out / or peraduenture wolde not haue hem out. Than he as a true louer ſendeth out his ooſt of trybulacyons to repelle and to dryue out of the herte theſe vanitees whchey and they myght abyde wolde fynally deſtroye the houſe of the herte and robbe it of all the goodes of vertue whiche is in it. Wherfore Eccleſyaſtes ſayth. ¶ Precurre prior in domū tuā. ¶ That is to ſaye. Whan thou ſeeſt the worldely vanytees renne in to thyn herte / renne thou byfore and ſtoppeth them and ſhyt ye dore of thyn herte that they haue no lodgynge ther by remembraūce of the hurtes that they do ther. For they kepe the herte fro ye loue of god fro the loue of themſelfe in ordre to god fro the loue of vertue / from holy medytacōns / from holy deſyres fro deuoute prayers / from dedes of pe naunce. And comonly whan the vanytees occupye

it is dyſpoſed to no vertue or to lytell. Suche men & wymen as mooſt labour to gete & to kepe the pleſures & goodes of this worlde / & labour lytell to kepe ther herte but let it renne where it wyll theſe are grete foles / for fynally theſe ſhall leſe. All theſe tran ſytorye vanytees they labour mooſt to gete ād kepe. and alſo themſelfe from the eternyte of Joye / & be brought to perpetual payne in defaute yt they keped norther herte as they ſholde haue done the tyme of this lyfe. And thoſe whiche gyueth lytel kepe to the wordely vanytees & proſperyte / but mooſt they applye theyr mynde how they may theyr hertes kepe wel accupyed. Theſe after the paſſynge of all worldely pleaſures ſhall haue theyr hertes replenyſſhed with the mooſt delycate & pleſaūtes hertely delytes of the glorye of god & of the Ineſtymable blyſſe and Joy of the felycyte of angelles & ſayntes in heuen. Theſe whiche ordeyne them mooſt ſpecyally to kepe ther hertes & lytell ſett by thoſe thynges whiche worldely folke mooſt deſyre are called foles in this worlde / but they are called wyſe of god / & theyr wyſedom ſhall be cōmended of all the heuenly multytude in the kyngdome of god. For this cauſe ſayth Salomon in his prouerbis. ¶ Omni cuſtodia ſerua cor tuū quia ex ip̄o vita ꝓcedit. ¶ With all thy dyly gence kepe well thyn herte for therof cometh lyfe / & dampnable deth cometh yf it be not well keped.
            This hert is the longynge of thy lorde god whiche hath grete pleſure to abyde in it whan it is clenly

keped fro fylthy mocyons of ſynne as he ſayth in the boke of Prouerbes. ¶ Delicite mee eſſe cū filiis hoim. ¶ My delyte is to be with the childern of men For theyr loue he becam a childe hymſelfe borne of the virgyne Marye wherfore lyke as yu deſyreſt to be welcome to his houſe ſee that yu kepe well thyne houſe of thyn herte / and oftentymes tourne therto & dreſſe it yt he wt no thynge ther be offended / but yt he may haue a pleſure for to beholde it as he ſayth in Canticꝭ. ¶ Reuertere vt intueamur te. ¶ Torne ayen yt we may beholde the. He ſayth not yt I may be holde the but yt we may beholde the / that is to ſaye / yf yu ſee well to thy ſelfe than I ſhall haue a grete pleſure to ſee the / for than I ſhall garnyſſhe thy ſou le with my grace to thy mooſt profyte & my pleſure Than I exhorte the whiche retorneth not to thy ſelfe as yu ſholde / take pacyently the trybulacyon whiche our lorde ſendeth the to the entente that yu ſhalt gyue good attendaūce to the kepynge of thyn herte & forſake the loue of thoſe wretched or vayne pleſures whiche let thyn herte fro the loue of hym. Thou thynkeſt yt thy trouble & payne gretely hurteth the▪ but it is the greteſt profyte & helpe that yu mayſt haue in this lyfe & the greteſt token yt our lorde loueth the & of this yu ſholde be mooſt glad for his loue yu ſhalt fynde fynally to thy mooſt Joye & comforte after this tranſytorye payne & trouble. This trybulacyon bryngeth the bothe to god & to thy ſelfe / lyke as thy vayne pleſures in proſperyte had dryuen

the fro bothe. And for this cauſe payne & trybulacy on is called the bande of god / for it tyeth the to god lyke as proſperyte louſeth the from-hym and byndeth to ſuche wretched & peryllous liberte of ye worlde / and in theſe bandes thou ſhalt lerne to knowe god and thy ſelfe and to chaunge thy lyfe in to an other maner of lyuynge. And whan thou by holy cuſtomes of this lyfe art tyed to hym / than he wyll tye the by payne to kepe the at home with hymſelfe And thus he ſendeth trybulacyon not only to brynge the herte home to themſelfe but alſo to kepe it at home that it go not fro themſelfe. Thy lorde god deleth gracyouſely with the whan he called the fro plente to pouerte. I mene not that he make the to loſe all thy good / but whan he maketh the to ſette lytell by thy good ſo that thyn herte is poore and naked without them / that is to ſaye / without grete affeccyon and loue of home. Soo ſayth Salomon. ¶ Eſt pauper in diuicus. ¶ Ther are ſome whiche are poore in rycheſſes / that is to ſaye / whiche that ſette theyr herte in maner noo more on them than yf they hadde no rycheſſes. To this gooſtly pouerte the whiche in the ſyght of almyghty god is mooſt habondaunt rycheſſe are the ſoules brought to hym whan that they are ſore hunted by grete aduerſyte and trouble and tyed to our lorde with the bande of trybulacyons. And not withſtandynge that our lorde kepeth the thus tyed that thou mayſt not renne at thy wyll at large as yu haſte ben acuſtomed afore

tyme / thynke not that thou loſes therby ony lyberte / but rather our lorde putteth the in more lyber te. Ther is noo very perfyte lyberte of the ſoule but only in thynges of vertue. This lyberte to renne wt thyn herte & loue to vanytees or to ſynfull werkes of this lyfe / this lyberte is thraldom & not rmenda ble more than it is to ſuffre a ſeke man as he that is in an hote axes to ete & drynke what he wyll deſyre / for his appetyte is ſo dyſordred wt corrupt humours that comonly he deſyreth thoſe thynges whi che be mooſte contrarye to his helth / lyke wyſe that ſoule is in a peryllous lyberte whiche at his owne pleſure hath power to ſynne. But whan our lorde by trybulacyon called it to hym & to be the louer of vertue at lyberte this is the perfyte lyberte. And ye other lyberte to ſynne is rather ſeruage for it maketh the ſoule ſeruaūt to the deuyll & fynally bryngeth to the boūdſhyp of hym in helle. And the lyber te of vertue bryngeth to the mooſt perfyte freedom of heuen. Whan the pheſycyan ſuffreth the pacyent to take what mete & drynk yt his appetyte is mooſt to it is a ſygne that he dyſpeyreth of his helth / & co monly they wyll ſaye he is but a deed man wherfor let hym take what he wyll / lyke wyſe whan our lorde the grete pheſycyan letteth the lyue after thy fleſ ſhely pleſure & maketh no reſtraynth by trybulaciō it is a token that he ſetteth lytell by the. And that thou haſte gooſtly ſekeneſſe whiche is not lykely to haue remedye / for ſuche are more deſyrous to fulfil

ther owne wyll than the wyll of god. They deſpyſe god as he ſayth by the ꝓphete yſaye. ¶ Filios enutriui et exaltaui ipſi autē ſpreuerūt me. ¶ I haue nouryſſhed my childern with goodes of this worlde & I haue exalted them to honour & they haue deſpy ſed me. yf yu wyll aſke me what is very. fredom I ſaye that he is not mooſt free whiche may do mooſt what he wyll / but he is mooſt free whiche leſte may do euyl / & ſo ther is mooſt lyberte where leſte power is to ſynne. Thā accordynge to this doctryne afore reherſed / ſythen our lorde maketh the by trybulaciō to knowe thy ſelfe & hym & tyeth ye to him that thou ſhalt not go fro hym / & bryngeth the fro thraldom of the fende & wretched lyuynge to perfyte lyberte of his loue & execucōn of vertuous dedes. wherfore yf yu fele thy ſelfe dyſcomforted by trouble & payne reduce theſe grete profytes to thy mynde & they ſhal comforte the ayen. For thy comforte is to remembre that he loueth the. And the mooſt token of his loue is yt he ledeth the by trybulacyon to hymſelfe. wher fore Joye thou in hym & he ſhall Joye in the / and than all thynges to thy mooſt auayle ſhall proſpere with the.
            THe fyfthe conſolacōn in tyme of trybulacyon is to remembre how yu art made therby haſtely to ſpende the in the waye to heuen / & to the blyſſed preſence of thy lorde god. For as it is ſayd before. Euery payne cometh of god / wherfore euery payne is ryghtwyſſe. And euery ſȳne cometh

of vs & euery ſynne is vnryghtwyſſe. wherfore as many trybulacōns & payns as yu haſt as many meſ ſēgers yu haſt ſent fro heuē to ſpede ye theder lyke as a man whiche in ye flouryng tyme of ſomer goynge thorugh a felde ful of fayre floures & a ſwete medo we of tyme wyl gyder of ye floures & for the ſwetnes & ſolacyous abydynge in ye place he wyl ſyt or laye hym downe / & ſomtyme falle on ſlepe / & ſo ye nyght cometh vpon hȳ afore he haue endeth his Journey / And ye man whiche laboureth in the foule waye the wynter tyde he fyndeth no place to reſte in to he co me to the ende of his Journey & yet maketh hȳ to haſte faſte yt he may come to an ende of his labour. Lyke wyſe the folke whiche are in the pleſant proſſperyte of this lyfe / they are ſo occupyed with gade rynge thȳges of pleſure as rycheſſes / fleſſhely delec tacios / honours & dygnytees yt they forgete ther Jor neye whether they are boūde out of this worlde. For here they ſeke reſte in the pleſure of this lyfe in maner as ther were none other felycyte ordeyned for man / & here they lye ſlepynge in ſynne & wretchedneſſe to ye nyght of deth come vpon hȳ / & than they are taken with the deuyles of helle / & neuer come to ſee god in his glorye whiche ſholde haue ben ye ende of her pylgremage. But ſuche as be in the wynter waye of aduerſyte ful of grete blaſt of temptacōns in ye ſoule / ful of ſharpe thornes of paynes & bodely ſekenes / full of grete flodes of worldly trybulacyon theſe folke haſte hym / for in ther waye they fȳde but

bytterneſſe / & therfore they haſte hȳ that they may come to reſte hȳ ſwetly at ye ende of ther Journey af ter ther ſore labour. For ye bytterneſſe of trybulacōn taketh fro the herte al falſe pleſure of this worlde / & ſo it maketh the good ſoules whiche our lorde vtterly & ſpecyally loueth to ſpede them to hym / & wyl not ſuffre hem to reſte hem & abyde in the waye / the thynges whiche he calleth the to by trybulacōn pacy ently taken are ſogrete / ſo precyous / ſo perdurable / & euerlaſtyngly abydynge that he wyl not yt yu ſhalt make taryenge in the lytell thynges whiche ſhortely ſhall ſlyp & vanyſſhe awaye. A good meruayll it is that ſuche perſones to whom god hath gyuen grete knowlege make theyr abydynge in the lytell thynges / & by the taryeng they make in ye ſmale thinges & grete labours they haue about hem to ordre hem fylty to theyr pleſure they ſhewe well they haue forgeten ye grete thynges yt our lorde called hem to. All thynges whiche delyte the herte Inmoderatly make ye herte to tarye & loſeth moche tyme of his pylgremage / but whan payne & trybulacōn take away vayne delyte fro the herte & maketh ye thynge bytt whiche was wont to be beloued than it maketh the herte to ſtyre hym forwarde ſwetly and leueth the vayne taryeng. And therfore the prophete ſayth. ¶ Multiplicate ſūt infirmitates eorum poſtea accelerauerunt. ¶ Whan ſekeneſſe is multeplyed than ſuche as haue taryed before they haſte hem for war de full faſte. Ha good lord many one ſholde go full

ſlowely in theyr Journeye of they were not haſted forwarde with ſharpe callynge by trybulacōus & in maner compelled with vyolence to procede in theyr waye. And lyke as the croked fete & affeccyons are feble & oftentyme wolde reſte in the vayne pleſure excent they were excyted to go / ſo our lorde ſuche as he ſpecyally loueth he calleth oftentyme vpon hem. And therfore it is wryten in the booke of Exodi. That the Egypcyens conſtrayned the childern of Iſraell to go out of Egypt in token that trybulacyons whiche are vnderſtande by the Egypcyens conſtrayne the hertes of the choſen childer of our lorde to go out of this worlde by the affeccyons of ther loue & ſpede them to that lyue there the grete pleſure ſtandeth in loue / & ther no thynge is but that is detely loued. And whan the loue goth fro the worlde the herte goth fro the worlde. For lyke as the bodye goth with the fote ſo the ſoule goth with the loue / ād where the loue is there the herte is O how glad the hertes ſholde be to departe from thoſe thynges where they haue more payne than pleſure / more ſorowe than ſolace / & go to thoſe thynges where they ſhall euer haue myrthe & ſwetneſſe and neuer fele poynt of bytterneſſe where is full Joye full peas wt out dyſtemperaūce of payne or trybulacōn. And he re yt haſte no grete pleſure in ony wordely thynges accordynge to thy dyfordynate appetyte / but fynaly it ſhal torne the to torment of hert. Than comfort thy ſelfe in trybulacyons for they dryue ye out or the

pryſon óf payne to the ryall kyngdome of pleſure / fro the fetters & chaynes to ye crowne / as Eccl. ſaith ¶ Interdū deducit 
                  •
               s de carcere ad regnū. ¶ Some tyme a pryſoner is drawen out of pryſon to come to a kyngdom. The herte is in pryſon whan it is tyed by loue to ye lowe erthely thȳges of this worlde / & ye more ye loue is on hȳ the more depe is ye hert in pryſon. Out of this depe pryſon our lorde drawe the with the bandes of trybulacōn whan he maketh thy loue to departe fro thoſe thynges which yu loueſt ſo moche / lyke as ye angell ſtroke ſaynt Peter on ye ſyde & bad hȳ ryſe ſwyſtly & go out of pryſon / as it is wryten in the boke of Act. So our loorde ſtryketh the many a tyme by his angell on the lyfte ſyde by aduerſyte to make ye haſtely to departe fro this pryſon / whan he fulfylleth thyn herte ſoo with ſorowe / or the bodye with payne yt the pleſure is gone yt thou haſt in thynges of this worlde / or whan he whithdra weth hem fro the with loſſe or deth / or whan he ſufereth hem to be vnkynde to the or trouble the and thwart wt the whiche yu loued ſo moche / than he caſeth ye out of pryſon. Lyke as ſaynt Peter playned not of the ſtroke wherby he was brought out of pry ſon / ſo ſee yt ye playne the not of ye ſtroke whiche brȳ
               geth the out of the gooſtly pryſon of thy ſoule & ma keth the to departe fro loue not profytable to the. For this is a ſuffraūt ſtroke whiche delyuereth the of ye feerfull pryſon of whiche foloweth the pryſon of helle to ſuche yt  neuer wyl departe fro this pryſō
               
of ſynne in this lyfe / or ellys pnrgatorye to ſuche as lately departe therfro. And yf thou wyll not ſuffre this ſtroke of thy ſyde pacyētly for thy ſelfe / yet ſuf fre it for his ſake whiche was ſtryken in to the ſyde with a ſpere for thy ſake / & receyue not grutchyngly thy lordes meſſengers whiche are ſent to brynge the to hym & brynge the fro peryllous place but welcome hym hertely and thanke thy lorde god vpon thy knees whith handes & herte whiche ſendeth hem to the / and than thou ſhalt do grete pleſure to hym gre te profyte to thy ſelfe / and the ſooner they ſhall departe fro the whan they haue brought the to hym by very true loue / whan thou murmures ayenſt thy trybulacyon than thou dooſt that is in the to repelle the meſſyngers of god fro the. This is fygured & betokened in the meſſengers whiche were ſende to hem that were beyonde the flome Jordan and they reſyſted ayenſt the prynces meſſage & ſende the meſ ſengers ayen without worſhyp & with empty hande. Flome Jordan is as moche to ſaye as loweneſſe or mekeneſſe the whiche techeth the hertes to loue god. And tho that dwelle beyonde the flood whiche paſſe mekeneſſe and are proude of the benefyt and creatures of god. And the proude folke that vnreue cently receyue trybulacyons the meſſengers of the kyng / and ſo the trybulacyons go voyde without re warde by theſe vngentyll receyuers / and that that the meſſengers are dyſworſhypped / that lorde and kyng is dyſworſhypped whiche dyde ſende them.

Thou ſholdeſt as well or better receyue trybulacyons for the loue of hym that ſente them to you as for the loue of that thynge that they are ſende fore. Trybulacyons they are ſharpe but they are profy table / for they tourment the herte in purgynge and they purge it tourmentyng in tourmenting whan the rebelle hertes receyue trybulacyons vnworthely than thty haue the tourment but they wanten the purgacōn of ye ſoule / for by the vnpacyence they fou le themſelfe more than they were byfore. And they may well ſore lamente the whiche haue the payne and doo leſe the fruyte therof. Than I exorte the and praye the in the parte of our lorde god that the whiche that knowed hymſelfe a ſynner and wolde loue god and come to his kyngdome that thou receyue thankefully trybulacyons of his ſendynge. And whan that thou feleſt the payne thynke than that thou hereſt the voyce of our lorde god callynge the to hymſelfe from the peryllous place that thou ar

            The ſixth conſolacōn foloweth here to ſuche as haue payne and trybulacyon whiche cometh of remembraunce how theſe paynes are det

                whiche of deute muſte be payed to almygh ty god fro whome noo ſynner ſhall aſcape without punyſſhemente. Ne noo man may take from hym that thynge that whiche is his deute ne dyſceyue

hȳ. This det
                  •
                are the paynes with whiche god of his ryghtwyſneſſe doth ponyſſhe ſynnes whiche are not vnknowen to hȳ whether they be done by body or ſoule / ther is no ſynne may be hyde frō his Infenyte knowlege / as Eccleſiaſtes ſayth. ¶ Oia videt ocl'os illiꝰ. ¶ His eye ſeeth all thynges. ¶ Oculi dn̄i ml'to plus lucidiores ſūt ſuꝑ ſolē circūſpicientes oēs vias hoim & ꝓfundū abiſſi. ¶ No thynge is ſo clere in our ſyght with the lyght of the ſonne as all thynges are in his ſyght whiche ſeeth clerely al the ſecre te euten

                  •
               . Thus he knoweth all offences & of ryghtwyſneſſe he muſte punyſſhe hem / & his power is ſuffycyent punyſſhe euery ſynne after the deſeruynge / wherfore after the ryghtwyſnes of god euery ſynner is detter to render payne to our lorde And notwithſtandyng yt the eternal paynes of helle are tranſlate in to temporal paynes by ye ſacrament of confeſſyon whiche was deutes for dedely ſynnes yet ther is grete payne beſyde ther penaunce ordey ned to ſynners other in this lyfe or in purgatorye. For many ſynnes are done in this lyfe whiche are neuer ſhewed in confeſſyon for they are forgete / & the gooſtly fader gyueth penaūce but only for ſuche as he hath ſhewed to hȳ by confeſſyon. Neuertheles he aſſoyleth from all as well from thoſe ſynnes yt yu art not confeſſyd of as for thoſe yt yu do confeſſe wt ſtandynge yu wolde be confeſſyd of them yf they came to thy mynde ſoo yt yu ſhall not be dampned for them / but yu muſte ſuffre temporall payne for them

here or in purgatorye. Than thynke that thou art detter of grete payne to god for many a dedely ſyn ne that yu haſte forget ſythen yu was borne whiche yu had not in mynde the tyme of confeſſyon. And in ye that euerlaſtynge payne is ordeyned for dedely ſyn ne yu mayſt vnderſtande yt whan ye outragyous payne of helle is cōmytted in to temporall payne that this payne muſte be grete whiche muſt be payed for dedely ſynne. Alſo moche penaūce whiche is enioyned is not fulfylled perfytly in this lyfe & therfore ther leueth moche to punyſſhe. Alſo dayly we multe plye venyall ſynnes whiche deſerue grete temporal payne / & by trybulacōn pacyently taken yu art made quyte of theſe deutes & as moche as ye ſuffres ſhall be rebated whan ye comeſt to thy coūte. And lyke as in the counte a counter of lede or laton lyeth for an hondreth ponnde & yet in hymſelfe is not ſo moche worth. So one daye payne well taken ſhall ſtande for the payne of a yere in the which is conteyned CCC dayes / as our lorde ſayth by the ꝓphete Ezechyell. ¶ Diem ꝓ āno ded
                  •
                tibi. ¶ I haue gyuen the a daye for a yere. O how glad ſholde yu be than of one dayes payne whiche delyuereth the fro the mo re bytter payne of a yere. O how gentyll ſholde yu take this payne whiche maketh to the ſuche a quytaunce / ſythen thy lorde whom thou art detter to of his grete mercy & gentylneſſe with this lytell delyuereth the fro the more therfore I coūſeyll the what payue that ſo euer thou ſuffre ſette it in thy compet

and beſeche god that it may ſtande for thyſy nne to acquyte the fro the grete paynes that thou haſte de ſerued by ſynne. Thus the theef whiche dyd hāge on the ryght hande of our lorde he tourned his her te to hym / and by that payne well taken he was delyuered from all paynes and hadde the clere ſyght and fruycyon for euer of the mooſt gloryous trynyte. Wo may that man or woman be yt whiche dayly multeplyeth dette byſynne and lytell or nought he payed by payne. For nother he ſuffreth the payne mekely to his profyte as a verry penytent the whiche god ſendeth vnto hym / ne taketh to hym wylful ly ony paynefull thynge for to delyuer hym out of his dette / and ſo he ſhall come afore the Juge at ye houre of deth charged with the hole counte in maner of his lyfe whiche ſhall be ſtrayte to hym / for and he laboure not for mercy whan the ſoule is in the bodye he ſhall neuer haue mercy after that it be departed ne be rebated of his deutees. In helle ſhal noo deute be rebated neyther by longe ne by bytter ſufferynge. There ſhall lordes and ladyes wepe for theyr apareyll and the vayne beaute of her bodyes the whiche they hadde ordeyned to pryde / to lechery and to vayne honours of the worlde. There ſhall alſo euery craftes man wepe for the myſuſynge of his crafte. And alſo clerkes the whiche haue not well vſed theyr connynge to the auayle of the ſoules. And marchaūtes for theyr falſe peny worthes And ſynfull men and wymen whiche prouyde not

here for theyr ſoules whiche are called marchaūtes of the erthe / for theyr labour is for to gete erthely ſolace / and there they ſhall ſee that they haue but ſmale penyworthes for the labour of theyr lyfe / for all the grete ſolace and hertely Joye ſhall be gone from them for euer. But the heuenly marchauntes the whiche ordeyne theyr labours of this lyfe to bye the heuenly Joyes and than they ſhall ſee the grete penyworthes paſſynge all the eſtymacyons of all the erthely creatures the whiche they ſhall receyue of the handes of almyghty god in thoſe grete Joyes of endeleſſe blyſſe / as it is wryten in the booke of Sapyence. ¶ Juſt

For the grete and the perfyte felycyte of that kyngdom may ſuffre there noo myſery to be neyther of ſynne ne payne. Wherfore all you the whiche are faythfull ſoules and byleue the promyſſe of god to haue Joye after this lyfe yf that ye wyll be ruled after his wyll.

And yf yu be of ſuche perfeccōn yt by the merytes of thyn holy lyuynge & blyſſed laboures taken for god yt yu haſte deſerued remyſſyon of thy fynne & art acquyted of thy payne / yet yf trybulacōn come receyue it gentylly / for it is not ſende to the without grete cauſe other to the Increſſe of thy merytes or to ſaue the fro ſynne whiche thou ſholde falle in except by trybulacyon & payne yt our lorde preſerued the from hit. For many whiche are Innocentes & full perfyte ſholde loſe theyr Innocēcy ādvertue except they were keped by trybulacōn. Thā all ye whiche wolde go quyte out of this worlde frō all deute of paynes make your payment whyles yt this moneye of trybulacōn temporall is of ſo grete a valoure that a lytell of it more maye redeme you fro that Infēyte payne & trybulacyon whiche ſhal neuer haue ende after this lyf and purcheſſe to you eternyte of Joye.
            
               
THe ſeuenth conſolacōn is to remembre that trybulacyon ſtrengthed the herte & maketh it able to receyue the precyous gyftes ot grace. For lyke as the hamer of the goldſmythe ād the betinge therof maketh the metall to ſtreche on longe vnder his hande accordynge to his wyll / of the whiche he maketh his veſſeyll. Soo almyghty god he maketh by trybulacōn the herte to ſtreche on brode & to be a veſſeyll to receyue & retene the bekefyces of his graces ther afore it was a hole maſſe as a lumpe of metall without abylyte ony thynge to receyue of our lorde / wherfore in tribulacyon thanke thy lorde god whiche maketh of thyn hert a chalys to receyue grete habondaūce of his grace. Of this dryuyng on brode of ye hert wt ſtrokes of tribulacōn ſpeketh the prophete there he ſayth. ¶ In tribulecione dilataſti micht. ¶ Lorde yu haſte dylated & enlarged myn herte by trybulacyon. wherfore I counſeyll the whiche deſyres to be ye electe veſſeyll of grace a whyle pacyently to ſuffre the ſtroke of ye hamer of trybulacōn in the forge & ſmythe of this worlde. This lorde neuer wyll ſtryke the aboue yt yu may be re yf yu ordre the to ſuffre / as he ſayth in the goſpell. ¶ Dedit vnicui
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                
               ſcdm ꝓpriā virtutē. ¶ He hath gyuen to euery man after his power. And the more he beteth the the more large he entendeth to make the veſſeyll of thyn herte / & with the more quantyte of his grace to replenyſſhe it with all. And lyke wyſe as the more precyous metall is more obedyent vnd
               
the handes of the werke than that metall whiche is of leſſer valour / as golde is more apte in ye goldſ mythes hande than yron & more precyoꝰ werke he may werke therin for it is more obedyent vnd the hamer Lyke wyſe the pacyenthertes are ye precyous goldē hert whiche are obedyēt to ye ſtrokes of trybulacōn after ye wyll of our lorde / & in theſe he werketh precyous werkes of grace & many fayre vertues / & the ſe curyous & mooſt precyous werkes of ye grete wiſe dome of god ſhall euerlaſtyngly apere in theſe obedyent & pacyent hert to the honour of god & grete pleſure to all his louers in the kyngdome of heuen where clerely ſhall be ſhewed all the ſecrete werkynges of the hert whiche are had in this lyfe. Suffre thy lorde than eſely to bete awaye yt roſty mocyons & ſynfull deſyres of thyn herte & to make it a clene veſſell apt to receyue ye Infuſyō of his grace. And yf ye ſtroke of yt hamer be paynful & harde to abyde recomforte the ayen in yt the goldſmyth is ſo wyſe & ſo good yt he may ſtryke no ſtroke but to ye mooſt auayle of the veſſele of thyn herte & accordynge to his wyl whiche no thynge may do but well. And yf yt be gentyle in ſufferynge his ſtrokes and left thȳ hert to hȳ deſyrynge yt he do therwith lyke as it pleſeth hymſelfe yu ſhalt fynde hȳ gentyl in temperynge of his ſtrokes & yt he wyl more eſely worke after as the forme of werke requyreth. But comonly the goldſmyth ſtryketh mooſt ſtrokes on yt veſſel whiche is mooſt precyous werke. The hertes whiche are

without dyſcyplyne & techynge they are harde and dyſobedyent vnd ye hamer & rather they breke than they wyll bowe after the entēte of ye werker. Be not as an olde broken panne whiche whan the werker ſtryketh it breketh & maketh many mo holes than were before. Thus harde hert & drye without loue ordeuocyon to god increſſe her payne vnd the ſtroke of trybulacōn for they haue no regarde but only to theyr pleſure & none to theyr demeryte & the ryght wyſneſſe of god whiche may not leue ſynne vnpunyſſhed in this worlde he ſtryketh bycauſe he wolde ſpare ye after this lyf where ye ſtrokes ſhalbe mooſt bytter to ſuche as thā ſhall ſuffre hem. And lyke as the herte groweth in fayth byleuyng yt the payne & trouble cometh of our lord. Alſo in pacyence by wylfull takynge & thankynge god therof / alſo in meke neſſe thynkynge yt he is worthy to haue ſuche payne & moche more / ſo the herte groweth in the grace ād loue of our lorde & ye rewarde of glorye. Thus meueth ye Eccleſyaſtes ſaynge. ¶ Suſtine ſuſtentacōes dei & riūgere deo & ſuſtine vt creſcat in nouiſſīa vita tua. ¶ Suffre the ſuffrynges of our lorde & be yu Joyned to hym. Suffre yu thy lyfe may waxe in the ende. This ſaynge may be vnderſtande dyuerſe wyſe as thus / ſuffre thou that god ſuffre for the / or ſuffre thou that god ſuffreth with the / or ſuffre thou that god ſuffreth in the / and the fyrſte ſence is that thou ſhall ſuffre that god ſuffreth for the in this worlde. He ſuffred for thegrete trouble ād enemyte

of ye worlde / he ſuffred for the grete ſclaūder & euyl reporte / he ſuffred for the contempt & deſpyſynge / he ſuffred for the grete pouerte wylfully / he ſuffred for the grete payne in bodye as weryneſſe / watche / hongre / thyrſt / grete ſorowe in ſoule / grete payne in bodye / & fynally the mooſt grete outrage payne of deth / & more than may be ſuffred by natural power For he reteyned his ſoule in his bodye in ſufferaunce of peyne aboue the power of nature largely to recompenſe for our offēce / ſo that he yelde vp his ſoule with a grete crye as ſcryptute ſayth ¶ Uoce magna tradidit ſpiritū. ¶ But by the courſe of nature the bodye is ſo febled byfore the departyuge of the ſoule yt it hath no power to ſormeony voyce. And ſo ſholde the bodye of our ſauyour haue be had not he reteyned his ſoule to ſuffre plentefully payne for our ſaluacōn / as he ſayth in the goſpell of Johan. ¶ Poteſtatē habeo ponendi aīam meā & poteſtatē habeo iterū reſumendieam. ¶ I haue power to put my ſoule fro my bobye whan I wyll / & I haue power to receyue it ayen & Joyne it to the bodye. And as the prophete ſayth. ¶ Apud dn̄m mīa & copioſa apud eū redempcio. ¶ With our lorde is mercy and plenteuous redempcōn. Remembre yt thy lorde god for thyn offēſe ſuffred theſe grete paynes of his grete mercy & pyte that he hath of the whiche be
                  •
               ȳge a ſynner may not be ſaued without his payne / for without his payne no payne is able to ſatyſfye for ſynne. Than I exorte the remembre his grete gentylnes

& lerne to ſuffre for hym ayen / & in parte recompence for his grete gentylnes & for thyn offence For ſythen he that was an Innocent ſuffred for the moche more thou that art a ſyuner ought to ſuffre for thy ſelfe. The hamers of this goldſmythe whiche is almyghty god are not only the paynes & trybulacōns whiche he werketh in the / & by cauſe thou ſhalt ſo thynke oftentyme that his werkynge is ſo ſecrete that the reſon of man can not fynde the cauſe therof perfytly / but alſo the aduerſaryes whiche he ſuffreth the to haue are his hamers to bete the & forge of the a perfyte veſſell by pacyent ſufferynge accordynge to his pleſure & to receyue hymſelfe here by grace & in the lyfe to come with the grete glorye of his eternall felycyte. And lyke as the hamer is ordeyned fynaly to the profyte & makynge of the veſſell & not the veſſell to the hamer / and the hamer in makynge of the veſſell and wyth the ſtrokes it is hurte in hymſelfe & conſumeth and fynally breketh. So the wretched & reprobate people whiche inworde & in drede trouble the choſen childern of our lorde they hurte hemſelfe / & fynally are brought to deſtruccyon & dampnacyon thorugh the grete malyce yt they haue to other / ād the pacyent takynges of theyr malyce purgeth the ſoules whiche ye haue the wronge done vnto them / and thus theyr werkes are profytable to other & dāpnable to themſelfe. And therfor ſayth Salomon yt the fole ſerueth to the wyſeman. ¶ Qui ſtultus eſt ſeruit ſapienti. ¶ That

perſonē is a fole whiche wylfully wyl do that thynge wherby it entēdeth to hurte an other & mooſt hurteth hymſelfe. And that perſone is wyſe whiche ſo wyſely taketh that thynge yt myght hurte him that geteth grete profyte therby. Thā thou whiche wolde be a clene veſſeyll & honourable to god ſuffre the ſtrokes of trybulacyon / ſuffre the ſtrokes of troublelers. Alſo yu whiche wolde haue the crowne of vyctorye in this worlde & the crowne of glorye in the lyfe to come / for the grete ſufferers are the grete cqonuerours. And with the betynge yt they ſuffre of payne & trybulacyon theyr crowne is forged on the flethy of ther herte. Than thou whiche deſyreſt to haue the crowne forſake not the ſtrokes of the hamers / for by theſe our lorde hath ordeȳed that thy crowne ſhall be made / and at ſuche tymes yt the ſtrokes are mooſt profytable to the whan thou with very fayth remembrynge the profytes of a pacyent & charytable herte kepe his perfyte obedyence to our lorde ād loue to thyn enemyes that thou canſt fynde in thyn herte to forgyue them & hertely to praye for them yt they may haue forgyueneſſe of our lorde. This fyre of charyte maketh thy werke to go forth ſpedefully lyke as the hote metall dylateth & goth abrode vndernethe the hamer / yet wt this charyte yu mayſt defende thy ryght & oppreſſe the malyce of thyn enemye by menes acordynge to Juſtyce & equyte yf thy power be therto / and ſpecyally whan of lykelyhode by grete ſuffraūce theyr malyce ſhold Increſſe. Alſo

thou ſhalt ſuſtene that god ſuſteneth with the / for he ſuſteneth with the & bereth the vp in ſuffrynge auerſyte by his ſuſtenyng of the yu arte borne vp that thou falle not vnder the grete ſtrokes of aduerſyte other by bodely deth or grete vnpacyence or rancour of herte many ſoules ſholde haue grete falles by falſe worldely ꝓſperyte & they were not keped vnder the ſtrokes of aduerſyte / and alſo theſe ſtrokes they myght not abyde except they had ſupportacyon of the hande of almyghty god with theſe trybulacyons thou art alſo ſuſtened and fede & made ſtronge lyke as the bodye is made myghty to bere grete burthens by materyall mete. This trybulacyons are bytter but they purge the ſoule & make it to growe in perfeccyon of gooſtly lyfe / wherfore I counſeyll the as the gooſtly pheſycyan of thy ſoule to refuſe not this dyſſhe of our lorde ſette it before the / for he hathe not only taſted this dyſſhe to the / but he hath plentefully taken hymſelfe of hit / as the prophete Jeremye prophecyed vpon hym. ¶ Saturabitur ob probriis. ¶ He ſhall be ſacyate ſayd he with rebukes Thus yu ſhalt not thynke thy ſelfe rebuked in that thou haſte trybulacyons & grete wronge done to ye in this worlde / but rather yu art worſhyped in ye that thou art called to the dyſſhe of our lorde. Of this dyſſhe was fede that holy man Job as he ſayth in his boke. ¶ Non leuabo caput ſaturatꝰ afflictione. ¶ I ſhal not lyft vp myn hede with payne and woo Than as yu haſt grete trybulacōn & moche to ſuffre

And therfore as yu wyll haue the ſwete receyue the ſowre for thy grete ſwetneſſe muſte come of bytterneſſe. Alſo thou ſhall ſuſtene that god ſuſteneth in the / for he within the ſo reteneth the mocyons of trybulacyons that yf he ſuſtened hē not they ſholde oppreſſe the downe / and therfore foloweth. ¶ Comungere deo et ſuſtine. ¶ As who ſayd / drawe thou nyghe & cleue to god for he is felowe to the in this ſufferynge & berynge of trybulacyon / wherfore be not aſtonyſſhed in berynge thynkynge that the burthen paſ ſeth thy power. For he bereth with the whiche wyll ſuffre the no more to bere but acordynge to thy power & the reſydue of the burthen he bereth it with the. He is ſo mercyfull & ſo gentyll that he wyll ſuffre noo ſoule to bere aboue his power in weyght of temptacōn & trybulacōn / as the apoſtle ſayth. ¶ Fidelis deus q nō paciet̄ nos tēptari vltra

Joye I counſeyll you pacyently to take this lyfe of trybulacōn / for by the ſtorkes of trybulacyon ye are made able to receyue & ſtronge to retene ye grace of our lorde wherby ye ſhall ſhortly be delyuered from all trybulacyon & come to the plentefulneſſe of the flood of delectacōn which ſhal flowe vpon you tro the grete eſſencyall mageſte of god / & ſoo replenyſſhe you that all your power ſhall be ſacyate eternally after this lytell and ſhort payne of this trā
               ſytorye lyfe.
            THe eyght conſolacōn is to remembre ye payne & trybulacyon maketh the to ſeche & labour for the ſolace aboue in heuen. For naturally euery man & woman hath apetyte to ſolace & delectacyon / wherfore whan they are put therfro in this lyte by bytter trybulacyon than theyr mynde renneth for to haue it in the other worlde. For in this lyfe & there both no man may fulfylle his appe tyte after his pleſure / for after the ordynaūce of god grete pleſure in this lyfe he hath ordeyned grete pai ne for it in that lyfe / for this pleſure is not without myſerye of ſynne / and grete payne here he hath ordeyned grete pleſure for it there. Wherfore trybulacyon in as moche as it excludeth fro the and Interdy
                  •
               eth erthely pleſure & ſolace / ſoo moche it prouydeth and openeth to the the heuenly ſolace. Lyke wyſe as the lorde of the towne where as grete plente of wyne is for to be ſolde / as in the contre there it groweth / he wyll make the taueners of the towne

to be ſhette vp to ſuche a tyme that he haue vttered his owne wyne. Soo our lorde maketh the tauerne of this worlde to be ſhette vp to the by trybulacyon to ſuche a tyme that thou haue bought his wyne of conſolacyon by merytes of this lyfe. Soo yf yu wylt haue wyne of conſolacōn thou muſte go to hym / as the prophete Johell ſayth. ¶ Beſtie agri quaſi area ſciciens inſpexerūt ad te quomā excecati ſunt fontes aqua
                  
                     
                  
                  rum
               . ¶ He calleth the beſtes of the felde fleſſhely affeccyons and deſyres of our herte / and the welles of the waters he calleth the pleſures of ſenſuall delectacyon. Whiche whan they are dryed with aduerſytees they couſtreyne the herte to loke vpwarde to heuen for drynke for than it can fynde none in erth and fayne it wolde drynke. And ſo moche the glory of god & the pleſure of the perfyte Joye is more deſyred of ye herte. And in this alſo he ſheweth to the his ſpecyall goodeneſſe whiche maketh all thynges ſo bytter to the that no thynge thou haſte pleſure to thynke on but only of hym. Wherfore ſayth ſaynt Auſten in his confeſſyons. ¶ Paciebar in cupiditatibus amariſſimas diſſicultates to ꝓpicio tanto magis 
                  
                     
                  
                  quam
               to minus ſinebas dulceſcere quod tu non eras. ¶ In my deſyres of worldely pleſures I founde mooſt bytter dyffycultees▪ for thorugh thy mercy thou wolde ſuffre noo thynge to be ſwete to me but only thy ſelfe. But perauenture thou wylt ſaye. Syr I complayne me not of the cloſȳge of this er thely tauerne ſoo that the tauerne aboue were opened

to me that I myght haue ſome ſwete drāught of the wyne of contemplacyon fro thens / but I fele that all the tauerners are cloſed to me / for no ſolace myn herte fyndeth neyther in bodely ne in goſtely thynges. To this I anſwere that not withſtandyn ge that the tauerne bynethe is ſhette vp / yet thou ſhalt not meruayle why the tauerne aboufe is not opened anone to the. For after the ſhettynge of this yu muſte deſyre the lorde therof to open it to the and beſechynge hym oftentyme that he wyll open it to the / for the deſyrynge of the openynge is to the encreſſe of thy meryte for the ſekynge of the delyte & gooſtly ſwetneſſe is of more meryte than to delyte and haue delectacyon in hym for that gooſtly ſwetneſſe cometh onely of hym / but the labour wherby thou art ordeyned to haue his comforte cometh bothe of hym and of the by his grace wherby the dedes of thy ſoule and of thy bodye are acceptable to hym. And therfore be not myſmade yf thou abyde a whyle at the tauerne dore afore it be opened to the For the lenger thou abydeſt at the dore knockynge the more thou ſhalt haue whan it is brought to the ſuffre thy thurſt to waxe for the more delectable the wyne ſhall be to the. Dauyd the prophete forſoke the pleſures of the worlde for to haue the gooſtly ſo lace from aboue and by cauſe he haddehem not anone he complayned hym as he that hadde payed his ſyluer and myght not haue his penyworth. And ther he ſayth. ¶ Quid enim michi eſt in celo et a te

quid voluit ſuper terram. ¶ Lorde what ſolace haue I deſyred to haue in erthely thynges / as who ſayd none / and yet thou gyueſt me no ſolace from heuen Thus he ſpeketh in the perſone of a ſekeſoule and Impotente to abyde the ordynate workinges of god but in maner complayneth as god were in defaute to whom our lorde may anſwere & ſaye / frende I thanke the that thou haſte forſaken the pleſures of the worlde for me / but yet thou haſte not deſerued onely to haue forgyuenes of all ſuche dyſpleſures as thou haſte done in the worlde / and muche more to haue the pleſures of me whiche be ordeyned for hȳ that are made clene and perfytly purged fro theyr offences wherby they haue dyſpleſed me. To this ſaynge yet he anſwereth in the perſone of a frayle ſoule thus. ¶ Uelociter exaudi me defecit ſpiritus meus. ¶ Good lorde here me haſtely and graunte me that I deſyre for my ſoule faynteneth me for taryenge and it may not lenger abyde. But after the grete and contynued deſyre of god he ſendeth ſuche comforte that the ſoule than ſayth. ¶ Deus cordis mei et pars mea deus ineternum. ¶ Thou art the god of myn herte and my parte euerlaſtynge. For only thou mayſt cauſe the Joye whiche I fe le in myn herte / and of that grete Joye that thy childern ſhall haue in the. I truſte that I ſhall with them be partener euerlaſtyngly. Euer complayne of thy ſelfe and thynke thou art not worthy to haue gooſtly comforte of god thy wretchedneſſe is ſuche

wherfore beſeche hym that he wyll comforte thē in thy fayth that thou falle not in dyſpere by the ſubtyll crafte of the deuyll whiche laboureth all that he can to dyſcomforte the. Sette not thyn herte on worldely comforte ne deſyre not of god the gooſtly comforte but in that tyme that it pleſe his mercy to gyue it the. Meke thy ſelfe and thou ſhalt haue the more / as ſaynt Peter ſayth ¶ Humiliamini ſub potentem anu dei et ipſe exaltabit vos. ¶ Meke your ſelfe vnder the almyghty hande of god and he ſhall exalte you / wherfore I coūſeyll the derely & thankefully to take trybulacyon for this withdraweth thȳ herte fro tranſytorye and vayne delectacōns of thiſ worlde & maketh the deſyre delectacōn in thy lorde god whiche is mooſt naturall to thy reſonable nature in whom ſhall be thyn eternall Joye and felycyte.
            THe nynthe conſolacōn is to remembre howthat trybulacōn bryngeth god in to ye mynde & maketh the ſoule to thynke on god and to bere hym in remembraūce / whiche without payne and trybulacyon ſholde lytell be thought vpon. Wherfore our lorde ſendeth trybulacōn as propters & rememberes to a dulle mynde. And ſoo whan he beteth the by trybulacyon he techeth the to knowe hym & Joyneth hymſelfe to thy ſoule by knowlege & whan thou ſufferes the trybulacōns pacyently for the loue of hym than thou Joyneſt thy ſelfe to hym And the more thy payne & trouble be the more tra

thou remembred of god. Thou ſhalt vnderſtande here that the Infenyte mynde of god knoweth all thynges togydre whiche euer are or euer ſhall be more dyſtynctly & perfytly than ony mynde create of angell or man may vnderſtande on thynges by hymſelfe. And he may no thynge forgete / for than he ſholde be mutable fro knowlege to Ignoraunce but after ye maner of ſpekynge of ſcrypture is ſayd that our lord forgeteh ſuche as he loueth not & ſetteth not by after the comon ſpekynge as we ſaye / this man knoweth not me whan he taketh lytel kepe of me. Soo our lorde ſuche as he loueth he knoweth by the knowlege of approbacyon ordeynynge hym to rewarde & grete Joye with hym. This knowlege he hath not of wretched folke yt he prayſeth not he approbateth them. And thoſe after ſcrypture our lorde thynketh vpon whiche he ſendeth comforte in trybulacyon & delyueraūce in ouercomynge in temptacōn and encreſſe of grace and well ſpen dynge of tyme / by good labour & occupacyon wherfore yf yu wolde be Joyned to god in thought where is the rote of thy ſaluacyon & in forgetynge of hym the rote of dampnacyon be glad of trybulacyon for this well taken knytteth the & god to gyder by bleſſyd medytacōn in thy ſufferynge / ſee thy mynde renne to hym & than doubtles his renneth to the. The bytter trybulacyons of this lyfe make the thought
                  •
                of Iheſu cryſt to habonde & multeplye in the hertes of his frendes lyke as the thought of man whan he

is in trouble lyghtly wyll renne to his frendes whiche he truſted that ſpecyally myght helpe hym in his vexacyon / & ſuche tyme this frende cometh ofter in his mynde than an other tyme. And thus our lorde by his ſuffreayne purueaūce ordeȳeth medytacōns of hym to be multeplyed in the myndes of his frendes to the gretter encreſſe of grace & vertue in hem. Wherfore in trybulacyon recomforte the in ye that yu art therby lyfe vp by medytacōn to almyghty god / and hath excluded fro the yt vayne thoughtes whiche were wont to occupye thy mynde ryght vnprofytable / & the god thoughtes well ordeyned to our lorde more profyte the without meſure than ony bodely good whiche trybulacōn may take fro ye & in token that his mynde is moche on his ſeruaūtes whiche are in trouble he ſayth in the booke of Exodi. ¶ Uidi afflictionem populi mei et recordatus ſum pacti mei. ¶ I haue ſene the trybulacyon of my people & I am remembred of the couenaūt and promyſſe that I haue made to hem. As who ſayth thou that art in trouble yf thou take thy trouble pacyently our lorde hath made a cōuenaūt to werke auayle therof whiche as yu ſhalt knowe hereafter ye it ſhall be to thy mooſt ꝓfyte / kyng Dauyd whan his owne ſone Abſolon hadde put hym fro the kyngdom and he wente lyke an outlawe from place to place for ſaluacyon of hymſelfe. One that was called Symey a wretched man whan he ſee hym he ſcorned hym and curſed hym and caſte at hym ſtones

and the foule ſtynkynge derte / & whan the ſeruaū
               tes of Dauyd wolde haue ben vpon hym to haue ſtryken hym & to haue reuenged theyr mayſter. Dauyd cōmaunded they ſholde not do ſo ſaynge thus. ¶ Dimitte eum vt mala dicat ſi forte reſpiciat dn̄s et reddat michi bonū ꝓ maladictioēs hac hodierna. ¶ Suffre hym let hym allone in curſynge and rebu kynge me / for by this ſufferynge I truſte god wyll rewarde me / and for this curſynge pacyently taken he wyl gyue me ſome good rewarde. Thus Dauyd wolde ſuffre the curſynge & Iniurye of his enemyes as the mene to make hym to haue ſpecyall helpe of our lorde in his grete nede whan his owne ſone perſued hym to put hym to deth. Therfore ſuffre thou pacyently the euyll ſaynge & Iniuryes of euyll folke / ſuche bryngeth the to the bleſſynge & ſpecyal helpe of our lorde in ſuche thynges ther thou haſte ſpecyall nede of his helpe. I ſayd byfore that our lorde remembreth his couenaūt to ſuche as be in trybula cyon. Here thou wyll aſke me what couenaūt that it is. He maketh couenaūt with ſuche as pacyently ta ke trybulacyon to delyuer hem & that they ſhall haue power of delyueraūce / and that he ſhall be felowe with hem as longe as they are in trybulacyon in berynge the trouble as it is ſayd before. This is fygured in the boke of Danyell whan he & his felowe were put in the brennynge ouen there appered one with hem lyke the ſone of god whiche made the ouen as ſo temperate as it hadde ben full of aprety

colde wynde with a temperate dewe therwith that the fyre hurte them not in the ouen but it flowe out of the ouen vpon ſuche as kyndeled the fyre and de ſtroyde them / and thoſe in the ouen were delyuered. Lyke wyſe yf thou blyſſedly take trybulacyons and blyſſe god lyke as the thre childern blyſſed god whiche were in the ouen than thou ſhalt haue delyueraunce / and the trybulacyons ſhall be caſte on thyn aduerſaryes whiche brought the to trouble by the helpe of Iheſu cryſte the ſone of god whiche yf thou felouſhyp with hym with thyn hert ſhall ſwage the fyre of aduerſyte & brenne them therby whiche bloweth and kyndeled the fyre vpon the. Alſo our lorde maketh promyſſe to his frendes ye whiche are in trybulacyons that he ſhall rewarde them with the goodes of his glorye and more than thou mayſt conuenyently aſke of hym than the delyueraūce of thy paynes and troubles and rewardes of his excellent goodes in his kyngdom of glorye. And this couenaunt is wryten there he ſayth. ¶ Cum ipſoſum in tribulacione eripiā eum & glorificabo eum. ¶ with my frende I am in trybulacōn I ſhall delyuer hym and I ſhall glorefye hym. Than ſythen it is ſo profytable to the to haue god in thy mynde with feeré to offende hym / and to this grete auayle thou art brought by trybulacyon / than I counſeyll the whiche wolde be the louer of our lorde and haue hym to thy rewarde after this lyfe whom thou haſte ſpecyally in thy mynde the tyme of trybulacyon that

thou take pacyently payne & temporall vēxacyon.
            THe tenthe conſolacyon is to remembre that trybulacyon pacyentely & thākfully taken maketh our lorde more mercyfull to the / it maketh thy prayer more merytoryous & ſooner to be except of god whiche hath ordeyned that mercy ſhall be had through aſkynge of hym. Wherfore ſuche dulie ſoules as wyll not aſke mercy our lorde be teth them to make them crye for mercy as the childe doth vnder the rodde / wherfore our lorde is redie to gyue mercy to ſuche as faythfully & perſeueraūt ly calle for it at theyr petycyon & prayer. And that he accepteth the prayer of them is wryten in the boke of Eccleſyaſtes ther he ſayth ¶ Deprecationēleſi exaudiet dn̄s. ¶ Our lorde ſhall here the prayer of ſuche a ꝑſone as is hurte / wherfore yf yu fele hurte in ye by payne & trybulacyō comforte thy ſelfe ayen that theſe hurtes make thy prayers the ſooner to be herde of almyghty god for remyſſyon of thy ſynue & to the grete rewarde of thy ſaluacyon. Our lorde beteth ſuche as he wyll haue ſaued wt payne & trouble to conſtreyne them to crye for helpe by cauſe he wyll they ſhall vnderſtande yt theyr helpe cometh of hym whiche after longe contynuaunce of cryenge graūteth them theyr petycōn. Many a mouth is cloſed by proſperyte yt it cryeth for none helpe to god whiche is opened by aduerſyte. And ſo is wryten of Jonas the prophete ye whan he fled in to the contre of Tharſe he ſleped profūdly in ye felouſhyp there

he was as longe as the weder was fayre ād calme / but whan tempeſt dyde ryſe myghtely than he was wakened & to make hym crye for helpe to his god / the ſhypman caſte hym in to the ſee there a qualle receyued hym & ſwolowed hym in to his wombe / & there in grete fere of his lyfe amonges the bowelles of the qualle he cryed with feruent ſpyryte to god & with contynaūce / & that crye was herde of god. Suche hertes ſlepe with Jonas as in thef als Joye and deceyuable proſperyte of this lyfe forgett themſelfe & are brought to ye ſtate yt they lytel atende ne take hede to ony thynge but ſuche as are to theyr bodely pleſure or bodely hurte & lytel take hede to thynges of theyr dampnacōn or ſaluacōn / & the more proſperyte they haue ye faſter they are on ſlepe / & theyr ſlepe is the more peryllous & the more kyghe they are to dampnacōn. But lyke as ꝓſperyte maketh them to ſlepe / lyke wyſe aduerſyte maketh them to wake And there they holde them ſtylle in ſlepynge there they crye whan they are wakynge. And for this cauſe our lorde maketh to ryſe grete tempeſtes of trybulacyons to ſuche folke that be profoūdely in this peryllous ſlepe. For he wyl that they crye on hym & hertely beſeche hym for ſuche thynges as he wyll gyue them, For lyke wyſe he hath ordeyned what he wyll gyue them / alſo he hath ordeyned that they ſhall come therby by petycyons and by aſkynge of hym. And therfore ſayth Dauyd in the perſone of ſuche as haue theyr helpe of god by theyr petycyon

and prayer. ¶ Ad dn̄m cūtribularer clamaui et exaudiuit me. ¶ Whan I haue ben troubled I haue cryed to god & he hath herde me and graunted me my petycyon. Suche folke as are in proſperyte thei calle ſomtyme to our lorde / for many whiche are in proſperyte the are not brought ſoo faſte on ſlepe yt they forgete themſelfe and god lyke as they do whiche are very foles / yet in tyme of proſperyte the ſoules are ſlomerynge towarde ſlepynge ſoo yt the crye is not ſo myghty to obteyne the helpe of our lorde as in tyme of aduerſyte. Perauenture yu wylt ſaye to me / that the payne & aduerſyte whiche thou haſt incombred thyn herte ſo ſore yt yu leſſe prayeſt & leſſe calleſt to god the tyme of aduerſyte than in tyme of proſperyte. To this I ſaye that yf thou ſpeke noo worde in the tyme of thy payne / but only applye ye to take it pacyently than thy payne cryeth for the. For as many ſores & Infyrmytees as Lazarus had in his bodye / as many mouthes he had cryenge to god. And yf thou haue but a lytell prayer with thy herte or mouth that tyme the vertue of well takynge thy trybulacyon maketh it of grete meryte & derely to be receyued of god. As many trybulacōns as thou haſte and takeſt them well thankynge god of them / as many proptours & aduocates thou haſte in the courte of heuē to ſpeke for the & calle before the trone of god for expedycōn & helpe for the. And thꝰ yf thy mouth be ſhette at somtyme for greue & bytterneſſe yt thou feleſt by trybulacyō / thy trybulacōn

than cryeth for the with a grete voyce in the herynge of god / trybulacōns alſo make thy prayers ſooner to ſpede. Thy trybulacyons are as paymentes for the charter of thy delyueraūce / therfore pacyently ſuffre trybulacōns as thou wyll haue the letters of thy delyueraūce. And of this gyueth the example that holy man. Job whiche ſpeketh as he that had longe tyme abyden at the courte deſyrynge to haue his letters & hath not to paye for them. ¶ Quis michi det vt veniat peticio mea et quod exſpectabo tribuat michi dn̄s. ¶ who ſhall gyue me that my petycyon may come to me and that our lorde ſhal gyue to me thoſe thynges whiche I deſyre of hym. And ſpecyally amonge all other prayers the (Pater noſter) is mooſt ſpecyall. And that thou mayſt well vnderſtande whan he gaaf it to the by his owne mouth for he hymſelfe knoweth beſte what petycyon mooſt pleſeth hym. He not wery to crye notwithſtandynge that yu haſte not ſoone delyueraūce after thyn owne wyll at the courte of our lorde / for he knoweth the ordre of his courte wherfore it is mooſt expedyent that thou ſubmytte thy wyll to his beſechynge hym that after the ordre of his wyll he wyl delyuer the / and than thou ſhalt be ſure of blyſſed delyueraūce / & yu whiche thus abydeſt that thou gracyouſly labour for thy delyueraūce. The wretched people take not themſelfe as abyders / for he that abydeth he hopeth to haue ſome thynge / but theſe men loke for no rewarde of theyr trybulacōns

They abyde for noo thynge but for worldely good worſhype or ſolace / theyr hertes be ſo fixed in theſe worldely goodes that they loke lytell to the goodes of heuen and the rewarde of god. The ryghtwyſſe people whiche ſee by the ryghtwyſneſſe of god that noo ſynne may paſſe vnpunyſſhed / they deſyre of god to haue labour and trybulacyon in this worlde wherby they may eſcape ye bytter paynes and tourmentes the whiche ben ordeyned for ſynners that haue lytell payne in this worlde / and they Joye of theyr trybulacyon. For the payne whiche is pacyently taken for the loue of god in this worlde it purgeth not only the ſoule fro ſynne / but alſo it ordeyneth grete Joye after this worlde. And the payne the whiche is ſuffered after this lyfe it only profyteth to purgacyon of ſynne in ſuche as departe fro this lyfe in the ſtate of grace. Wherfore the holy man Job ſayth. ¶ Qui cepit verberare me ip̄e conterat me. ¶ He whiche hath begonnen to bete me he ſpare me not but bete me ynough / and in that only I wyll comforte me for that he gyueth me ſo grete payne and ſorowe and that he ſpareth me not. O take good hede of this holy ſoule whiche had loſte all his rycheſſe / all his childern / all his bodely helth that the fleſſhe felle roten fro his boones / and was deſpyſed of his frendes / and ſcorned of his wyfe. And yet all his ſufferaunce he helde it but as a begynnynge of his betynge and beſought god to bete hym fully / as who wolde ſaye / that god hadde but

lytell done to hym in all theſe / and other comforte he hadde not ne none other he deſyred to haue but that god wolde not ſpare hym. He vnderſtode that his betynge was payment to obteyne his letters of delyueraunce / and therfore he beſought god that he wolde gyue hym payment ynough that he ſholde not be taryed after his delyueraunce in defaute of payment. Alſo he vnderſtode that ſuche as our lorde ſpareth in this lyfe he ſpareth them for to be beten after this lyfe. And ſuche as that our lorde loueth he beteth them in this lyfe bycauſe that he wyl ſpare them after this lyfe. The wretched folke are ſpared here by the grete wrath and grete yre of god for he wyll here after hym reuenge of them. And therfore Job deſyred to make all his paymenthere. Thus yf that thou be dyſcomforted in that that thou art gretely beten with payne and trybulacyon / thou muſte comforte thy ſelfe ayen in remembrynge how that our lorde loueth the and wyll ſpare the in tyme comynge. Our lorde wyll not bete the twyes for one thynge whan as one betynge is ſuffycyent / and the ſuffycyence is made by a good wyll and by the good takynge of betynge. For one gentyll and obedyent wyll maketh a lytel payne as acceptable to god for remyſſyon of ſynne and encreſſe of grace as ony grete payne without ſuche a good wyll. For as it is wryten in Geneſis. ¶ Reſpexit deus ad abel et ad munera ſua. ¶ Our lorde dyd beholde Abell and his offerynges. 
                  •
               yrſte he be

helde his herte and his good entente / and than his gyftes / as who wolde ſaye / he made more of his gode and his louynge herte than he dyd of his gyftes / for ther is no gyfte acceptable to god except it come of a good herte. Thus this holy fader Job offered his payne to god with a good hert and with a good wyl whan he deſyred that he ſholde not ſpare hym and all was by cauſe that he wolde that he ſholde ſpare hym in an other place / and therfore lyke as he deſyred to be beten here alſo he deſyred for to be ſpared there. Wherfore he ſayth thus. ¶ Parce michi domine. ¶ Lorde ſpare me. wherfore I counſeyl the whiche our lorde here doth vyſyte with payne & trouble that thou thanke hym therof whiche ſo louely remembreth the that he wyll in tyme to come ſpare the in that place where the woūde of his ſtroke ſhall neuer be heled for the ſynne whiche deſerueth forgyuen after this lyfe ſtandynge thou knoweſt thy ſelfe a ſynner and muſte nedes be beten. I counſeyll the take thy betynge ſo that it may be profytable to the and auoyde the betynge in tyme comy ge / for ellys thou ſhalt be beten both here and there here thy wounde may be heled but there it ſhall neuer be heled.
            THe. xi. conſolacyon is to remembre how the herte is keped and nouryſſhed by trybulacyon. Our lorde hath ordeyned that the goodes of the hert ſhalbe vnder ye kepynge of trybulacōn / & wt out ſuche kepyng of tyme they are loſt as

it was preu

               n in the wyſe man Salomon of whom ſaynt Gregorye ſayth. ¶ Ideo ſapīa cor ſalomonis deſeruit quia nulla tribulacōis diſciplina illud cuſtodiuit. ¶ The wyſedom of god dyd forſake the herte of Salomon for no dyſcyplyne of trybulaciō dyd it kepe. For lyke as the fyre is keped vnder the aſſhes & the ſede vnder the ſnowe / lyke wyſe the her tes of the frendes of our lorde are keped vnder the couerynge of trybulacyon. In token of this our lorde cōmaūded that his tabernacle ſholde be couered with here whiche is ſharpe to the entente that this ſharpe couerynge ſholde defende the precyous curtens of ſylke whiche was vndertheym So our lorde couered the ſoules of his louers with ſharpe trybulacyonsto the entent that the grete tempeſtes of fleſſhely / temptacyons ſhall not fade the fayre ornamentes of vertue whiche clotheth the ſoule. And this trybulacyon bryngeth in to our mynde the myſerable ſtate of our nature how ſoone it is brought to ſekeneſſe of bodye / temptacyon of ſoule by Inordynate pleſure of malyce & of wyll & how vnable it is to bere perfytly the weyght of ony trybulaciō but only by the ſpecyal ſupportacōn of the grace of our lorde. And thus we are madē by trybulacyon to me ke our ſelfe where as proſperyte made vs to haue more pleſure in our ſelfe than we ought to haue / ād made vs hyer in our conceyte than we ſholde haue be. And therfore of ſuche that haue no trybulacyon in this lyfe it is wryten in the ſpalter. ¶ Cū hoībus

               kes that growe of pryde / as whan thou art meued to ſaye thynges cōmendable of thy ſelfe to the entente that thou ſholde be cōmended hauynge no reſpecte to god ne to the cōmendacyon of hym. This auayntynge ād booſtynge groweth of the vyce of pryde and whan that thou art dyſobedyent and frowarde and wyll folowe rather thyn owne wyll than the counſeyll and byddynge of ſuche whiche ſpeke to the for thy profyte and is dyſpoſed to chyde & to braulle with the whan thy wyll is not fulfylled. Alſo trybulacyon dooth nouryſſhe thyn herte as it is wryten in Deutronomye. ¶ Inundaciones maris quaſi lac ſugges. ¶ Thou muſte ſouke the bytter floodes of trybulacyon as they were mylke / lyke as the childe ſouked the mylke to the encreſſe of the bodely helpe & helth. So thou muſte ſouke the bytter trybulacōn to thy gooſtly helth / for yf thou take them ſwetely than thou groweſt in vertue & in the grace and fauour

of our lorde wherin ſtandeth the helth of thy ſoule / wherfore in thy trybulacōn comforte the with this mylke whiche ſhall brynge vpon the ſwete flood of the glorye of god.
            THe. xii. conſolacyon in the tyme of trybucyon is to remembre that trybulacyons do teſtefye and bere wytneſſe to thyn herte that our lorde dooth ſpecyall loue the / and therfore thou ought to receyue them gladdly / for they come for to bere wytneſſe that thou ſhalt haue the gretteſt thynge & of the mooſt valour that thou mayſt deſyre in this lyfe whiche is the loue of god. And this ſheweth Salomon where as he ſayth. ¶ Qui diligit filium aſſiduat illi flagella. ¶ The fader whiche that loueth his childe he beteth hym oftentymes. Thus our lorde kepeth his childern euer vndernethe ſome rodde / for he beteth not alwaye with one rodde for ſomtyme he beteth by trouble of the ſoule / ſomtyme by payne of the bodye / and ſomtyme whan it ſemeth that he ſpareth & yet he beteth. As whan he ſuffreth the to goo at lyberte and thou thynkeſt thy ſelfe out of trouble / yet he ſuffreth the thoughtes and temptacyons to come in thy mynde as that thy conſyence is greued and there he beteth the / and thus he ſpareth the ſomtyme in betynge & he beteth the in ſparynge. But ſuche as he ſparetij in this lyfe / he ordeyned that after this lyfe that al his ſcourges ſhal come vpon them al at ones in the bytter payne of dampnacyon. And than he ſhall

auaūce & promote to the grete & endeleſſe proſperyte to his childern whiche he hath beyet in this lyfe. And ther ſhalbe ſhewed the grete loue of hym whiche he dyd bete in this lyfe / & the hatred & wrath of them whiche he ſpared in this lyfe / for than he ſhall caſte of hym to gydre all his vengeaunce and all the tourmentes & paynes whiche they deſerue here ſhal be hylled vpon them there as our lorde ſayth in the boke of Deutronomye. ¶ Congregabo ſuꝑ eos mala et ſagittas meas complebo in eis. ¶ I ſhall geder to gydre the paynes vpon them & I ſhall ſtryke them fully with myn arowes. Than thou whiche deſyreſt to haue the loue of our lorde and to knowe that he loueth the / be glad whan the wytneſſe of his loue cometh to the. Perauenture thou ſayeſt that proſperyte is alſo wytneſſe of his loue / for ſuche as our lorde loueth ſomtyme receyue proſperyte of hȳ lyke as other tyme they receyue aduerſyte / ād thus thou ſayeſt that ſythen both come from one hande & one maner of folke yt the one is no more wytneſſe of the loue of god than the other. To this I anſwere that not withſtandynge that both proſperyte ād aduerſyte come of our lorde / yet the mooſt token of loue is aduerſyte more than proſperyte. For that is the mooſt token of loue whiche the fader of heuen gyueth to hym yt heloueth beſte / but he gaaf to our ſauyour his ſone & his blyſſed moder whom he loued beſte mooſt trybulacyon in this lyfe & lytel proſperyte / wherfore aduerſyte is the mooſt ſure token

of loue. Alſo ſythen oure ſauyour come in to this worlde as a marchaūt in to a feyre to choſe ye good & leue the euyll as yſaye ſayth. ¶ Ut ſciat eligere bonū & reprobare malū. ¶ But this wyſe our lorde refuſed proſperyte & the kyngdome of Jure whan it was offered to hym & choſe aduerſyte and grete labour & payne all his lyfe / and with the mooſt byttereſt deth endeth his lyfe. Than yf thou wylt be awyfe marchaūt folowe hym whiche can not be deceyued in his marchaūdyſe. Than cheſe with hym here trybulacōn / & thou ſhalt haue with hym the Infenyte Joye & conſolacyon.
            THe. xiii. conforth in trybulacyon is to remembre that yf thou ſuffre thy payne and trybulacyon pacyently than yu makeſt a grete conqueſt of thy gooſtly enemyes & vtterly confoū
               deſt all theyr malyce. For all theyr labour is to make the to take thy trybulacōn with grutchynge and a wofull herte bycauſe thou art let therby fro ſuche pleſures as thou art dyſpoſed to haue yf thou were without ſuche payne & trouble. Wherfore yf thou take thy trouble pacyently & with a meke & obedyent herte referrynge it as a mene & meryte to come to ye euerlaſtynge. Joye & pleſure. And yt yu haſte a wyl not to be ſor
                  •
                in that thou art let by trybulacūn for thoſe dyſceyuable pleſures whiche ſholde make the to loſe this pleſure of eternal felycyte / than thou obteyneſt vyctorye of the fendes whiche tempte the to the contrarye / and they ſhal haue more payne after

that they bē conquered / therfore ſayth the prophete. ¶ Perdes o

               s qui tribulāt aīam meā. ¶ Thou ſhalt vndo & punyſſhe all thoſe whiche trouble my ſoule And of euery fende that thou geteſt the better of / thou ſhalt haue the place of glorye in heuen whiche he ſholde haue had yf he had not fallen as Orygenes ſayth of theſe wordes in Deutro? Omnis locus quē calcauerit pes veſter. veſter erit. ¶ And ſcrypture ſayth that theſe holy & gracyous ſoules whiche ouercome & breke the purpoſe of the deuyll / they. I
                  •
               
               lude hym & deceyue hym as Dauyd ſayth. ¶ Draco iſte quem formaſti ad illudendum ei. ¶ This dragon the fende thou haſte made hym that ſholde be deluded & deceyued whiche at all tyme laboureth to deceyue. For good ſoules vſe the temptacyons of ye deuyll contrarye to his entente / for by thoſe thynges they are meke wherby he wolde brynge them to pryde / and by that they are pacyent wherby he wolde make them vnpacyent / and by thoſe thynges they are brought to chaſtyte wherby he wolde brynge them to lecherye. And thus they gyue hym a falle in his owne tourne and with that ſame croke they caſte hym downe / with the whiche he entended for to haue wraſteled them downe. O how gladde mayſt thou than be whiche pacyently haſte taken aduerſyte. For by the merytes of this lyfe thou haſt deſerued to haue full domynacōn of thyn enemyes at the houre of deth than they ſhall be aferde of the for than thou ſhalbe confermed in grace and ſhalt

haue power to tye and to bynde them lyke as the bere warder & keper bȳdeth his beres. For thou whiche putteſt them to fere & ſhame in this lyfe reſyſtynge theyr temptacyous thou muſte than be terryble to them for than yu ſhalt receyue thy grete power of god in rewarde of thy batayl / wherfore thou whiche wolde haue a Joyfull houre of deth take pacyently paynes & troubles of this lyfe.
            THe. xiiii. conſolacyon is to remembre that yf thou take trybulacyon pacyently yu draweſt to the the mercyfull loke of our lorde / and mekeſt hym with grete pleſure to beholde the / & of this mayſt thou be Joyfull that ony thynge ſholde be in the wherfore our lorde ſholde haue a ſpecyall pleſure to beholde the / for this thou mayſt be ſure that yf he haue pleſure to loke on the / by that loke thouſhalt haue profyte of hym / wherfore pacyently ſuffre a whyle for yu ſhalt be ſure that of this ſufferaūce ſhall growe grete profyte. This profyte yu mayſt not loke to haue haſtly / for after the ordre of wyſedom of our lorde it mufte haue a tyme in growynge. Lyke as ye huſbande man loketh not for repyng of his corn as ſoone as he hath ſowen it. Our lorde is nothaſty in hys werkyng but doth al thyng by tyme & delyberacōn as yu mayſt ſee in ye werkes of nature. Thy nayles & thy heere groweth cōtynualy but they growe ſo ſoftely that ye mayſt not perceyue theyr growynge loke vpon them as perfytely as yu canſt / and yet by proceſſe of tyme yu mayſt ſee yt they

be growen vnder thyn eyen yet thou perceyueſt not Lyke wyſe grace & grete vertue groweth in thy ſoule by pacyent takynge of aduerſyte / & that yu ſhalt well perceyue yf thou perſeruer in pacyence / thꝰ vertue groweth yet tho yu perceyueſt it not. Than ſpecyally our lorde hath pleſure to loke on the whan thou takeſt trybulacyons to the entent that he doth ſēde them to the / that is to ſaye / as penaunce for that yu haſte ſynned / and to obteyne therby grace & vertue. And that by thy pacyent & thankefull ſufferynge yu ſhalt gyue good example to ſuche as do knowe thy trouble. And than thou mayſt ſaye as it is wryten in the boke of Trenos. ¶ Uide dn̄e qm̄ tribulor. ¶ Beholde lorde for I am troubled. As who ſayd / well taken trouble is the cauſe that thou lokeſt on me / & this trouble thus taken maketh of croked ſoules ryghtwyſſe ſoules / of the whom Dauyd ſayth. ¶ Oculi dn̄i ſuꝑiuſtos et aures eius ad preces corr. ¶ The eyen of our lorde are ſet vpon ye ryghtwyſſe men / & his eeres are nyghe to theyr prayers. But yu wylt peraduenture ſaye that alſo he beholdeth wret che men / for it foloweth. ¶ Uultus autē dn̄i ſuꝑ faciences mala. ¶ The face of our lord is vpon them that done moche euyl / but attende ye then what foloweth in the ſame verſe. ¶ Ut ꝑdat de terra memo riam eorr. ¶ Our lorde loketh on the wretched men to the entent that after a lytell whyle they ſhall neuer be remembred after to ye honour of god & theyr cōmendacyon. But by the good ſoules whiche here

pacyently take trybulacyon our lorde ſhall euer haue honour / & they alſo ſhall haue perpetuell laude & cōmendacōn / lyke as we ſee in the chirche of god cō tunuall honour done to god by ſuche as haue gretely ſuffred for god and for theyr ſynnes in this lyfe. Ther was neuer kyng in this worlde whiche had ſo grete honour as now haue ſome ſayntes whiche was afore tyme but a poore man or a poore womā & in theyr tyme were lytell ſet by amonge the people of the worlde. And therfore ſayth the prophete. ¶ Nimis honorati ſūt amici tui deus. ¶ Thy frendes good lorde are hyghely honoured. Of ye ryche man of whom is ſpoken in the goſpell of Luke whiche was clothed in purple & rychely fedde euery daye ye people of this worlde dyd loke & dyd hym gretereuerence / but almyghty god lytell attended hȳ ne the company of heuen / for he lytell attended the people of our lorde / & contrary wyſefewe gaue kepe to the poore lazar that laye at his dore & deſyred but the crōmes that felle from his table & none was gyuen hym / but almyghty god & the heuenly creatures behelde hym lyeng with grete payne afore the gates of this ryche man. And that was ſhewed in theyr departynge fro this lyfe / for ther was ſende of god a ryall Imbaſſet of angelles to receyue the ſoule of the lepre & to brynge it with grete Joye in to Abrahams boſom. And the ſoule of the ryche man whiche had proſperyte & felycyte of this worlde was buryed in helle & there it is yet for in helle is

no redempcyon. Theſe the now whether thou wylt that the ſyght of our lorde be ſet vpon the for thy pacyence in the tyme of thyn aduerſyte & therby to haue this comforte whan thou ſhalt departe fro this worlde / or to haue thy pleſure after the tranſytorye courſe of this worldely proſperyte and in maner be forgeten of god & the dwellers of heuen / and at the houre of deth to be taken with the terryble tyraūtes of helle / and thyder to be brought to dwelle without hope of remyſſyon of ſynne or delyueraūce of payne euer without ende. Ther was neuer Emperour ne kyng that had ſo grete pleſure to ſee his ſeruaunt fyght for his loue as almghty god hath in the why che that beren pacyently trybulacōn ayenſt all the malyce of the deuylles for his ſake. Ther is no grete euyl done in this lyf but it is ſoone ſhewed amon ges the company of helle / ſo ther is no grete thynge of perfeccyon done ne ſuffred in this lyfe but it is ſhewed to the courte of heuen to theyr grete Joye. Than ſee that yu ſuffre Joyfully payne & trybulary on as yu wylt that god & the heuenly multytude haue Joye in the & gretely deſyre that yu ſhalt be felowe with them in theyr beatytude & felycyte.
            THe xv. conſolacyon is to remembre that our lorde ſendeth the trybulacyon to make the to come to knowlege not only how thou ſholde rule thy ſelfe accordynge to the pleſure of hym / but alſo that he hath ordeyned the to be a teherof other. For lyke as none can ſo comfortably

dele with a ſeke perlone as the pheſycyan whiche hath ben in the ſame ſekeneſſe afore / ſoo none can gyue ſoo comfortable a counſeyll to a ſoule in trouble as that perſone the whiche afore tyme hath had ſuche atrouble / & by the grace of god hath well gyded hem ſelfe therin. As ſaynt Poule ſayth. ¶ Tribulamur pro veſtra exhortacōe et ſalute. ¶ We are troubled for your exhortacyon and gooſtly helth. As who ſayd. Our lorde ſendeth vs trouble to the entente that we ſholde teche you bothe by example of pacyence ſufferynge / and alſo by holy exortacyonon of worde that ye be obedyent for the grete rewarde whiche is ordeyned for pacyence in trouble. And that by lyke reſons as we fynde in our ſelfe by the Inwardely techynge of our lorde wherby we more Joyfully take trybulacyon ſuche or lyke we ſholde ſhewe to you for to make you lyke wyſe pacyently to ſoffre aduerſyte / and lyke as the good ſoule whicho is in trouble techeth an other bothe in worde & in dede how it ſhall pacyently & holyly & take trybulacōn ſo yt it hath ordeyned for it double rewarde in ye glorye of god. Thus yu ſhalt haue reward of god in that yu pacyently ſuffres ſekeneſſe & trouble than kefully in thy ſelfe. Alſo thou ſhalt haue rewarde in that yu ſheweſt thy pacyent takynge to other to the entente to gyue them good example and to the laude of god pryncypally and not to thy cōmendacyon Alſo thou ſhalt haue rewarde in that thou techeſt with thy mouth to other after the good mocyons &

medytacyons that yu feleſt in thy ſelfe wherby thou feleſt thy ſelfe comforted in thy payne and trouble And in the Joye of heuen thou ſhalt haue ſynguler rewarde of glorye by eche one of them whiche are profyted here by thy techynge. And they ſhall gyue the thankynges euerlaſtȳgly for the gooſtly helpe yt they haue had of the here in this lyfe. And ſo thou whiche ſuche vſeſt thy trybulacyon to the profyte of many thou ſhalt haue grace Joye gyuen to the by trybulacyon / as the prophete Danyel ſayth. ¶ Fulgebunt iuſti tan
                  
                     
                  
                  quam
                ſtelle in perpetuas eternytates et ſicut ſplendor firmamenti qui ad iuſticiam erudiunt multos. ¶ The ryghtwyſſe men ſhal ſhyne as ſterres / and thoſe the whiche teche other to lyue ryghtwyſly ſhall ſhyne as the hole fyrmament. Thus lyke as the lyght of the fyrmament the whiche conteyneth the ſonne the mone and the ſterres / ſoo the glorye of thoſe that teche other for to do and to ſuffre vertuouſly ſhal paſſe the glorye of thoſe the whiche are not ſuche techers. wherfore I counſeyll the in the tyme of thy payne and trouble that thou applye thy mynde dylygently to lerne well for to take thy trouble to the good example of other that thou be nombred amonges the gloryous multytude of techers.
            THe. xvi. comforte is to remembre that our lorde by the hygh prouydēce of his wyſedome & mooſt ryght ordre of his Juſtyce hath made this ſtatute that yu whiche haſte loſte hym by

proſperyte & falſe Inordynate pleſure of this worlde ſhalt fynde hym ayen by aduerſyte of payne ād trybulaciō / as it is wryten in the booke of Deutro? ¶ Inuenies em̄ ſi cū toto corde inqueras eū & trybulacione. ¶ Thou ſhalt fynde hym yf thou ſeke hym with all thyn herte in trybulacyon. O how gladde mayſt thou be whiche art ſet by the very ordynaūce of our lorde in that waye & ſtate that thou may fynde hym yf thou wylt. Peraduenture thou wylt ſaye Syr yf I vnderſtode that this payne & trouble yt I fele at myn herte or in my bodye came of our lorde I wolde be glad therof & it ſholde be welcome to me but I thynke that I am the cauſe therof my ſelfe. To this I ſaye that what ſoweuer ſorowe yt thou haſte in herte or payne in bodye god is the pryncypall cauſe therof / ād it is ordeyned by his wyll and ryghtwyſneſſe that thou ſhalt haue it. He gyueth payne in this worlde whiche he ſhall gyue Joye in the other worlde / and the deuyll is pryncypall cauſe of ſynfull pleſure in this worlde whiche ſhall tourment & punyſſhe the vayne occupyed ſoules in the other worlde. It is laboryous and paynfull to the to ſeke god thus with ſo grete fere in trybulaciō / wherfore in thy ſekynge remembre the fyndynge of him how Joyfull it ſhall be to the / for thon ſhalt fynde hym therby yf thou take it thankefully whiche ſhal tourne all thy payne in to pleſure / thy ſorowe in to ſolace / thy tranſytorye aduerſyte into the perdurable Joye & proſperyte. wherfore ſayth the prophete.

¶ Letetur cor quērenciū dn̄m querite faciē eius ſemper. ¶ They haue cauſe to haue a lyght herte whiche ſeketh our lorde wherfore ſeke ye the Joyfull face of hym euer. The payne of ſehynge is bytter but he is ſwete whom thou ſekeſt by payne / & yf thou ſeke hym by payne to the entent that yu wolde be a louer of hym thy payne ſhall apere the leſſer as Dauyd ſayth. ¶ Letent̄ in teoēs qui querūtte. ¶ All thoſe whiche ſeke the they ſhall be lyghtned in the. But the beftyall folke whiche ordeyne not theyr payne as a mene wherby they ſholde come to our lorde but only take it as a grete hurte to theyr bodye / & ryght lytell or nought remembre what profyte theyr ſoule may haue therby they are very woo with all for they hate more the myſerye of payne than the myſerye of ſynne & more labour to auoyde thynges to theyr dyſpleſure than to the dyſpleſure of god. And yet our lorde kepeth ſuche folke in payne to ſuche a tyme tyll he haue made them to ſet lytel by them ſelfe & be more redye to applye them to do after his wyll than after theyr owne wyll / lyke as the mayſter ceſſeth not to punyſſhe his ſeruaūt to ſuche a tyme tyl he hath brought hym to werke after his wyl ſpecyally whan it is ſuche a ſeruaūt that he hath a fauour to hym & wyll not put hym from hymſelfe. Thou wylt peraduenture ſaye / a they ſpeke falſely vpon me & ſclaūder me how can this come of god / for this is dedely ſynne / & no ſynne may be Imputed to god. To this I anſwere that our lorde of his

ſecrete dome & vnknowen Jugement ſuffreth the to ſynne / & of that ſynne he wyll werke vertue in the & make the to haue wyl to forſake ſynne / whiche wyl cometh of ſorowe & confuſyon that thou haſt in thy ſelfe / & this payne of ſorowe whiche thou feleſte byte thyn herte ryght bytterly cometh of god / and alſo the good wyll whiche foloweth therof in forſakynge of ſynne / & therfor the prophete ſayth. ¶ Imple facies eo
                  
                     
                  
                  rum
                ignomina et querent nomen tuum dn̄e. ¶ Fulfyll the face of theyr ſoule with ſhame & rebuke & than they ſhall ſeke the. And therfore our lorde ſuffreth many a ſoule to falle in grete ād openly knowen ſynne wherby they haue grete ſhame and are brought therby to forſake ſynne / & to ſet ryght lytell by themſelfe whiche byfore made to moche of themſelfe / & hadde grete pryde and vayne glorye in the good name & reporte that was made vpon them And by this comon ſhame and ſhamefull reporte whiche gooth vpon them this vayne pleſure is clene taken from them. Thus god is ſo good that he ſuffreth none euyll to be done in the worlde neyther in his electe childern but of the whiche that he werketh a grete auayle to them. They ſhall clerely ſee vpon the daye of Jugement that lyke as they neuer dyd good thynge vnrewarded / ſoo they neuer dyd euyll thynge but our lorde dyd werke grete auayle therof to theyr rewarde. yf thou ſekeſt our lorde in the waye of paynfull pouerte and wanteſt thynges as it is ſene to the that it is neceſſarye to thy lyuynge

& ſuſtentacōn / remémbre that yf thou pacyently take thy pouerte thou ſhalt haue the greeteſt rycheſſe that euer was / for thou ſhalt haue god himſelfe / & all the rycheſſe that he hath ſhall be thyn. As he ſayth in the goſpell. ¶ Omnia meā tua ſunt. ¶ All my rycheſſe. are thy rycheſſe. O than be thou glad to bere thy pouerte Joyfully for a whyle whiche haſtely ſhall be made ſo ryche. It were a grete pleſure to a poore man to haue promyſed ye rycheſſe of a temporall kyng / but moche more pleſure it is to a faythful ſoule to haue promyſed the Ineſtimable rycheſſe of god whiche is the kyng of kynges ād lorde of lordes. Thou ſayeſt peraduenture. Syr I haue loſte my bodely helth wherby I myght haue done many good werkes to the honour of god and profyte of my ſoule / & fro theſe I am letted now by grete ſekeneſſe & oftentyme fere of deth. I anſwere the in this / that peraduenture whan thou hadde thyn helth thou occupyed full ſymply / & more thou vſed it to thy pleſure than to the pleſure of god / ād yu ſholde haue comen to more Incōuenyentes therby yf thou had contynued therin. And for myſuſynge of thyn helth our lorde hath ſende the now this ſekneſſe / & there as yu wolde not ſerue hym well in tyme of they helth in well doynge / ſerue hym well now in tyme of ſekeneſſe by good ſufferynge. Be thou ſure that yf thyn helth had ben more to his pleſure than ſekeneſſe / yu ſholde haue had it ſtandynge that he is the pryncypall cauſe of all bodely ſekeneſſe,

and ther thou leſeſt thy bodely helth whiche is better to the than all the rycheſſe of the worlde yt yu geteſt ayen therby yf yu gracyouſly take it whiche goodes paſſe thy bodely helth & all bodely rycheſſe of the worlde / that is to ſaye the grace of our lorde in this worlde with vertue of mekeneſſe pacyence and charyte / & fleſſhely payne is the ſpecyall remedy to auoyde fleſſly ſynne for the tyme of payne ye wyll hath but lytell pleſure in remembraūce of fleſſhely delectacōn / & therfore yf it be tempted it is the more ſtronger to reſyſte it / and therfore ſayth the apoſtle ¶ Cūinfirmor forcior ſū. ¶ Whan I am ſeke in my bodye I am ſtronger to reſyſte the temptaciō of vyce in my ſoule. By payne the ſeke perſōe is brought to ſet lytell by hymſelfe / for yf it be full of payne it ſetteth lytell by precyous clothes / it ſetteth lytell by worſhyp & worldly honour. And that perſone is meke whiche ſetteth lytell by hymſelfe / but pacyence is more paynful / that is to ſaye wylfully & thankefully to take the ſekeneſſe with hande & herte to gyue louynge to our lorde therfore / neuertheles a fayth full ſoule remembrȳge theſe profytes whiche come by ſekeneſſe is full glad therof & conformeth ye wyll to the wyll of god / but this pacyence to god muſte haue charyte to thoſe whiche are about it. yf thou haue theſe thre / that is to ſaye / mekeneſſe in lytell ſettynge by thy ſelfe / obedyent pacyence to god / charyte to ſuche as be aboute the without chydynge & braulynge than yu haſte grete wytneſſe ye whiche ſhal

brynge the to the glorye of god & to the crowne of vyctorye. O how gladde mayſt thou be to ſeke thy lorde god and fynally to fynde hym by ſekeneſſe / whoos gloryous ſyght is of ſoo grete a pleſure that thou wolde cheſe to ſuffre the grete paynes of helle longe tyme after a ſhorte ſyght ſo that thou myght ſee hym ayen. And yf a ſoule whiche is in the paynes of helle myght ſee hym / the grete Joye of the ſyght of god ſholde ſtoppe for the tyme all the paynes of helle that hit ſholde fele none / for that Joye ſholde ſo fulfyll the wyll with delectacōn & pleſure that hit ſholde fele no payne for ther ſholde no place be lefte for ony contrarye felynge. In this lyfe ther is no pleſure ſo grete but ther is payne moche more / but after this lyfe ther ſhal be pleſure incomparable more than ony payne may be now. I exhorte the to ſeke thy lorde truly by trybulacōn & payne whiche hath ſought the & foūde the by incomparable more payne than thou whiche haſte loſte hym mayſt ſuffre to fynde hym ayen.
            THe xvii. comforte is to remembre that our lorde hath ſende trybulacōn to the to the entente that he wyll make the aferde to of offē
               de hym / for comonly our freyle nature refuſeth noo thynge whiche is pleſaunt to it except it be meoued of fere / and many ther are whiche in lacke of perfyte fayth fere ryght lytel the paynes to come / wherfore ſuche ſholde be taken in the ſnares of the deuyl and falle to contynuaunce in ſynne yf our lorde of

his grete mercy dyd not ſende them payne & trybulacyon in this preſent lyfe. But he kepeth them ſoo occupyed with fere & bytterneſſe of payne that ther mynde is withdrawen fro theyr dyſordynate pleſure. And yf they haue yt ſpecyall grace to thȳke that theyr payne is mynde to them from our lorde to make them to flee ſynne / than theyr payne and trouble putteth them in grete fere to ſynne & maketh them to flee it. Wherfore Job ſpekynge of ſuche ſayth. ¶ Terrebit eos tribulacio et anguſtia. ¶ Trybulacyon and anguyſſhe ſhall fere them. Many ther are whiche as yonge childern that haue lytell vſe of reſon lyue al after ſenſualyte & pleſure of theyr fleſhe and that is theyr grete ſporte & delyte in this worlde And often tyme in the myddes of theyr playnge tyme without ony warnynge they are called out of this worlde to theyr acounte & Jugement where the ſentence of dampnatōn is ſhortly gyuen of them & forth with they are put in to payne of the vengeable fyre of helle ther they ſhall abyde euer without ende. That ſoule whiche fleeth ſȳne pryncypally for fere of payne or for worldely ſhame or for ony other creature it ſhall haue noo rewarde therfore in heuen / but yet by that it offendeth leſſe to god than it ſholde haue done yf it had no ſuche fere & ſooner ryſeth to grace. This fere of payne is called a ſeruyle fere / for thus fereth the ſeruannt for to offende his mayſter by cauſe he fereth he ſholde haue grete ſtrokes and punyſſhement. But the good childe

fereth his fader pryncypaly for loue that he hath to hȳ & bycauſe he wolde not offende hym. And ryght ſo the good wyfe loueth her huſbonde & for loue that ſhe hath to hym ſhe wyll not offende hym. But the euyl wyf fereth to make tranſgreſſyon of her ſpouſage more for fere of ſtrokes than for loue. Thus the childely fere of god is merytoryous & ſhal haue grete rewarde of our lorde whan a ſoule fleeth ſynue for loue yt it hath to god / & bycauſe it wolde not fynally be ſperate from hym. Neuertheleſſe for ſeruyle drede the ſoule is brought to childely drede oftentymes. Than ſythen no thynge ſhal departe the ſoule fro god & brynge it to perpetuell payne but on lyſynne / our lorde ſendeth the payne to departe the fro ſynne / than he wyll by temporall payne delyuer the fro the eternall payne & Joyne the to hym in perpetuell glorye / wherfore yf ye lyft thy mynde to god in the tyme of payne & trybulacyon ſeeyng ſo faderly he deleth with the / & what profyte he ordeyneth to come of thy payne & trouble thou ought to take it pacyently and gyue hym grete laude and prayſynge therfore whiche thus mercyfull deleth with the.
            THe. xviii. conſolacyon is to remembre how our lorde prouydeth for the whiche art in trybulacōn yf yu take it well that after thyn herte be conſtrayned to god with anguyſſhe of payne it ſhall be dylated with Joye ād opened ayen / as the prophete ſayth. ¶ In tribulacōe dilataſti michi.

¶ Thou haue dylated by trybulacōn myn hert to me. And as it is wryten in the booke of Tohbye. ¶ Poſt tribulacionē et flectū exultacionē infundis. ¶ Thou gyueſt to the herte after trybulacōn & we pynge Joye & gladneſſe. Ther is none after the ordynate lawe of our lorde that cometh to grete gladneſſe in hym but after grete ſoryneſſe of this lyfe / & ſpecyally yf the ſorowe and trouble be taken for the loue of god in ordre to hym / as the prophete ſayth. ¶ Detorrente in via bibet ꝓpterea exaltauit caput. ¶ He ſhall drynke of the bytter water in the waye of trybulacyon & therfore he ſhall exalte afterwarde his hede with Joye in god & delectacyon. That thynge whiche maketh man or woman to ſett leſſe by hemſelfe that ſame dyſpoſeth hem to make more of god. Some tyme a perſone is made to ſet leſſe by hemſelfe by myſery of ſynne / for many one whiche made ryght moche of hymſelfe / whan they are fallen in to grete & abhomynable ſynne than they are aſhamed & abhorre with hemſelfe. And after this lytel makynge of hemſelfe they begynne to lerne to make moche of our lorde and come as Mary magdaleyn dyd to grete grace & pleſure in god. By myſery of payne alſo many come to the ſame pleſure in god and that is the better waye / for myſery of ſynne can neuer be good / & the tyme is loſte of gooſtly profyte as longe as a ſoule is in this myſery & our lorde hateth this wretchedneſſe of ſynne. But wretchedneſſe of payne yf it be wel taken is of grete

pleſure to our lorde & it is of grete meryte & the tyme is well ſpended they yt be in this myſery well taken / wherfore I exhorte the whiche haſte had pleſure in ſynne / & worlde haue pleſure in god take pacyently payne & trybulacyon / and than thou ſhalt ſee that thou ſhalt lerne to make moche of god & he ſhall make moche of the.
            THe. xix. conſolacyon is to remembre how a dulle ſoule by trybulacyon is made quycke to ſerue god / as the ꝓphete ſayth. ¶ Si ambulauero in me dio tribulacōis viuificabis me. ¶ yf I ſhall walke in the myddes of trybulacyon thou ſhalt receyue and quyken me. Lyke as a dulle ſeruaunt by ſtrokes is made ſharpely to applye his labour / ſo are dulle ſoules whiche had lytell appetyte to ſerue god be made to ſpende theyr tyme ye better in the ſeruyce of god / and ſpecyally ſuche as haue grace to remembre what payne that he ſuffred for them this fayth is quyckenynge and lyfe to them / as ſaynt Poule ſayth. ¶ Quod em̄ viuo in fide filii dei viuo qui dilexit me et tradidit ſemetipſū ꝓ me. ¶ My lyfe is in the fayth of the ſone of god whiche loued me and dyd offer hymſelfe wylfully to ſuffre grete paynes for me. Perauenture thou wylt ſaye. Me thynke I ſerued god better whan I was out of payne and trybulacyon for than I hadde my lyberte of my mynde / now I am conſtrayned with payne to haue my mynde ſo of god that I can but ytell remembre god beſyde it. To this I anſwere

that yf thou haſte ben well occupyed the tyme of thy proſperyte by good werkynge / now thou art weloccupyed ye tyme of thyn aduerſyte by good ſufferynge / and bothe theſe are requyſyte to perfyte lyuynge yf thou mayſt not multeplye ſo many good dedes as thou dyd before yf thou haue pacyence in thy trybulacyon than thou haſte one thynge that is worthe many thynges / and this vertue of pacyēce can neuer be hadde but in ſharpe aduerſyte / lyke as the ſwete roſe groweth on the ſharpe thornes / ſoo groweth this ſwete and ſofte vertue of pacyence of the ſharpe thornes of payne and trybulacyon / wherfore I counſeylle the to take pacyently thy trybulacyon and thanke god hertly therof / and than thou haſte the vertue of perfyte ſufferynge whiche ſhall obteyne of our lorde after thy payne be paſte the vertue of good doynge.
            THe. xx. conſolacyon and comforte in tyme of trybulacyon is to remembre how it werketh to the the precyous crowne of glorye as the prophete Yſaye ſayth. ¶ Dominus coronabit te tribulacione. ¶ Our lorde ſhall crowne the by trybulacyon. Thus all the blyſſed multytude in heuen haue geten theyr crownes of whom the angell ſayd to ſaynt Johan euangelyſt. ¶ Hii ſunt qui venerūt ex magna tribulacione ſed abſterget deus lacrimas ab oculis ſancto

our lorde ſhall wype awaye the teeres fro the eyen of the holy folke and they ſhall neuer after haue wepynge ne ſorowe for all the fyrſte occaſyons of ſorowe are paſſed with theſe that are in blyſſe. And it is Impoſſyble that they ſholde fele the leſte payne or ſorowe that myght be thought. Thus the appoſtle wryteth of our ſauyour. ¶ Humiliauit ſemet ipſum factus obediens vſ

Thou whiche deſyreſt to come to the grete felycyte and Joye of god / thou mayſt not loke to haue reſte and pleſure in this lyfe / for none may haue the falſe felycyte of his worlde and the true felycyte of that other worlde / wherfore the apoſtles of god dyd forſake the pleſures of this worlde & toke them to a paynfull lyfe / as the apoſtle ſayth. ¶ Nos ſtulti ꝓpter xp̄m infirmi et ignobiles eſurimus. ſicimꝰ. nudi ſumꝰ. colaphis cedimur. inſtabiles
