By the mynde I remembre him. By the vnderſtōdynge I beholde him gooſtly. And by wyll or loue I loue and deſyre him. Whan I remembre god

I fynde in hym in my mynde. & fele therin in him ſwetneſſe & pleſyre of hym. lyke as he voucheſaufe to gyue me. By ye vnderſtōdynge I beholde in hym what he is in hymſelf. what in holy angellys / and what in his bleſſyd ſayntes. what in his creatures. & what in mankynde. In hymſelfe he is incomprehenſyble for he is both begynnynge & ende: Begynnynge without begynnynge / & ende wythout ende By myſelfe I vnderſtōde how he is comprehenſyble whan I may not atteyne to vnderſtōdynge and knowlege of my ſelf whome he hath made. In holy angellys he is pleſaunt and deſyderable. For theyr deſyre is alwaye to beholde hym. In ſayntes he is delectable. For they happy & bleſſyd delyte them in hym contynually. In creatures he is meruelous. For by his myghte & power he createth all thynges the whiche he gouerneth mooſt wyſely / & dyſtrybutyth mooſt benyngnely: In mankynde he is amyable & louely. For he is theyr god· & they ben his people. And he dwelleth with theym as in his owne tē

Sothely we owe to loue hym moche. ſyth he hath loued vs ſoo moche / & made vs after his owne ymage & lyknes & ſoo hath he done to none erthly creature. Sothly it behoueth that ye thynge that is made after an ymage to be accordynge and lyke to the ymage or

ſymylytude that it is fourmed after / and not to haue vnworthely the name of an ymage in vayne. Therfore lete vs ſhewe in vs thymage of hym in deſyrynge of peas and regardynge of trouth. Lete vs holde and kepe hym by perfyte loue and charyte in our mynde. Lete vs bere him in our conſcyence and to hym preſente in euery place lete vs do due reuerence and worſhyppe.
               ¶Our ſoule ſothly is the ymage of god / for aſmoche as it is apte and mete to take and receyue hym and maye be partener of hym. It is the ymage of hym. not only that it remembreth itſelfe vnderſtondyth or loueth itſelfe. But by cauſe it maye remembre / vnderſtonde. and loue hym. whiche made it.

Sothly that ſoule is ryghte happy and bleſſyd in whome oure lorde fyndeth reſtynge. And in whoos tabernacle he dwelleth and reſteth.

That is an happy ſoule that maye ſaye. My lorde & maker hath reſtyd in my tabernacle. Soothly he ſhal not deny to ſuche a ſoule the euerlaſtynge reſte of heuen. O why then̄e loke we not in our ſelf: but ſeke our lorde amonge outwarde thynges: the whyche is with vs / yf we wyll be with him. Sothly he is both in vs and in vs. but yt as yet is by fayth: vnto ſuche tyme as we maye deſerue to ſee him clerly We knowe (ſayth the apoſtle) that by fayth Cryſte abydeth in our hertes. By fayth I remembre my maker / I worſhyp my mercyfull redemer. and abyde my ſauyoure. I byleue that he lyueth in all creatures / that he dwelleth within me. And alſo I truſte to knowe him in himſelf: the whiche is moche more blyſfull & Ioyfull than all thyſe ben. For ſothly to knowe perfytely the fader / ye ſone / & ye holy goſte is euerlaſtynge lyfe / perfyte blyſſe & excedynge pleſyre. For the mortall eye hath not ſene / ne eere herde ne mannys herte vnderſtōde clerly and perfytly how moche clerneſſe. how moche Ioye. how moche ſwetnes we ſhall haue in that bleſſyd ſyghte whan we ſhall beholde face to face him yt is the lyght of all bryghte thynge. the refuge and reſte of trauelers & labourers the receyuer and keper of them yt torne to him / the very lyfe to all that lyue. And the crowne of theym that ouercome theyre gooſtly enmyes. Thus I fynde in my ſoule the ymage of the hygh & gloryous Trynyte. to the whiche mooſt hyghe &

gloryous Trynyte: I owe to referre and orther all my lyfe. that I maye remembre hym and putte my playſyre & cōtemplacyon in hym. The ſoule is the ymage of almyghty god yt whiche conteyneth thre thynges. the mynde. ye vnderſtōdynge: & wyl. To ye mynde we attrybute & put all thynge that we lerne or know though we thynke not alway theron. To the vnderſtōdynge we attrybute all that we knowe is true. the whiche alſo we cōmende & putte to our mynde. By the mynde we ben reſemblyd & lyke to the fader / by vnderſtondynge. to ye ſone / & by wyll or loue to the holy gooſt. for there is no thynge in vs more lyke to the holy gooſt. than is the wyll or true loue. For true loue is the yefte of god more nor ſo precyous that there is noo yefte of god. and it is ble & excellente than it is. For true loue that cometh of god. and is god himſelf: is properly called the holy gooſt: by whome ye loue of god is diffuſed & ſprad in our hertes. And by whome all the holy & bleſſyd trynyte dwelleth and abydeth in vs.

And we ought to truſte without doubte one of ij: thynges. for he ſhall yeue vs yt we deſyre. or elles yt he knoweth more prouffytable to vs. thynke therfore of god the beſte yt thou mayſte. & of thyſelf the worſte. & yet yu ſholde hope worſe of thyſelf than yu mayſte thynke.

Geue not thyſelf to worldly thynges but vſe theym to the prouffyte of the ſoule. What place ſomeuer yu be in dreſſe well thy thoughtes / & reuolue ſome holſome thynges in thy ſoule. For ſothly euery place is apte & cōuenient to gode thoughtes & medytacions Therfore gadre togider thy ſoule with an hole felycyte & Ioye. & abyde at lyberte in thin inwarde habitacyon. & walkynge in ye largeſſe of thyne herte. Make redy therin to Cryſte a reſtynge place and a large chambre. For the mynde of a wyſe man is alwaye to god. We ſhold alway haue hym before our eyen. by whom we haue our beyenge. our lyf & vnderſtondynge. For lyke as we in our beynge haue him

Therfore vſe thyſelfe as the temple of god. for that yt is in the lyke to god / Sothly cheyef honoure & worſhyp to god: is to worſyp & folowe hym. Yf yu be meke. thou foloweſt hym. For ſothly the mynde of a meke man is an holy temple to our lorde. & his herte is a chyef awter to hym. Thou worſhyp peſte him yf yu be mercyfull lyke as he is mercyfull to al. Sothly it is an acceptable hoſte & oblacyon to god to do well to all men for the loue of Cryſte. do all thynges euyn as the chylde of god. that yu maye be acceptable to him yt hathe voucheſauf to call the his chylde. In all thynge yt thou dooſt knowe well & haue in mynde. yt almyghty god is preſente / therfore beware yt nother thy ſyghte ne thy thought abyde or tary in vnleful delectacyon or pleſyre or· & be wel ware yt thou nother ſaye ne doo thynge yt is vnlefull for noo maner of pleſyre or lykynge / leeſt thou offende god in ony dede or in ony token therto. The whiche is preſente in euery place. & beholdeth what ſomeuer thou dooſt Sothly thou haſte nede

Yf he be not with ye by grace he is nyghe to the by vengaunce / but woo to the yf it be ſo with the. Ye but woo to the yf it he be not ſo wyth the. For almyghty god is wroth wt hym yt he chaſtyſeth not whan he ſynneth. For hym that he amendeth not by correccion. he ſuffreth peryſh in euerlaſtynge dampnacyon.

Whan I fede it I nouryſſhe myne enmye ayenſte me. Yf I ete ynough & it be ſtronge. the helthe of it is aduerſarye to me. Sothly the worlde hath vmbylapped & beſyeged me on euery ſyde. and woundyth me wyth his arowes by .v. gates / yt is to ſaye v. bodely wyttes. The eye beholdeth & torneth the wytte of the mynde. the eere hereth & boweth therto the intente of the herte. Smellynge letteth cogytacion & thought. the mouth ſpeketh & oft tyme diſceyueth. Thardoure & hete of luſte for a lytyll occaſyon is excyted & ſtyred. And but it be ſoone lefte & ouercomen. anone it occupyeth & heteth / brenneth / & kyndleth all the body. For fyrſte it prycketh & tyckleth the fleſſhe a lytyll wyth thoughte. Thenne it defoyleth ye mynde wyth fowle deletacyon. And at the laſte it ſubdueth the mynde to it by conſentynge to ſhrewdnes. The deuyll alſo whome I maye not ſe (and therfore I ſholde rather be the more

He hath put a gylder in golde & ſyluer. & in all thynges that we myſuſe. whan we ben delyted euyll in them we ben ſnared. And he hath not only layed a ſnare. but alſo lyme.

Alas for ſorowe A faythfull man is oft tymes ouercome with thyſe dartes. Woo is me For bataylles ben on euery ſyde. Dartes flee on euery ſyde. On eury ſyde ben temptacions & perylles.

And where there is noo drede of a rebuke. the tempter the deuyl is moche bolde. and wyckydneſſe is lyghtlyer done. Noo merueyle. for there is batayle on eueryche parte. and peryll & drede on euery ſyde. And lyke as they done that dwelle where warre is. Soo muſte we loke hether & thether. and torne the hede aboute to loke at euery cragge or ſtronde. The fleſſhe tempteth me with thinges of luſte & pleyſyre. The worlde with vayne thynges. And the deuyll with bytter thynges As ofte as fleſſhly cogytacyon mouyth my mynde vnportunely with mete. drynke or ſlepe / & other carnall thynges perteynynge to ye body: the fleſſhe ſpeketh to me. And whan the herte is occupyed wyth vayne thoughtes / as wt ambucyon & deſyre of worldly worſhyppes. with boſtynge & pryde. it cometh of the worlde. And whan I am prouoked vnportunely to Ire. to wrath / & bytterneſſe of the ſoule. it is ſuggeſtyon of the deuyll. the whyche behoueth to be reſyſteth & withſtonde. as it were ye deuyll hymſelfe and to ſhon & flee as fro the paynes of helle.

Thyſe thre enmyes fyght ayenſt me and purſue me: ſomtyme pryuely and ſomtyme openly: but alwaye malycyouſly. Sothely the deuyll truſtyth cheyfly in helpe of the fleſſhe / For an enmy of houſholde noyeth mooſt. And it hath made couenaunt with hym to diſtroye me / For it was brought forth of ſynne: nouriſſhyd in ſynne: Corrupte gretly at his begynnynge: but moche more corrupte by euyll cuſtome. And that is the cauſe that it is ſo contrary to the ſoule That it grutchyth ſomoche / and is ſoo vnpacyente to be taughte: And entycyth vnlefull thynges: & obeyeth not to reaſon / & wyll not be refreyned wyth ony drede. That crokyd ſerpent enmy of mankynde helpyth it: & vſyth it. For he hath no other deſyre labour ne ſtudy: but to leſe our ſoules. This is he yt

Excyteh the deſyre of the fleſſhe. maketh redy occaſyon of ſynne And ceſſyth not to tempte the hertes of men wyth a thouſande craftes of hurte and noyenge. This is he that ſmyteth vs wyth our ſtaffe. & byndeth oure hondes wyth our owne gyrdell. that our body the whyche is yeuen to vs to our helpe. maye be to our hurte and ſclaunder. It is a greuous ſtryffe & grete peryll to fyghte ayenſte an enmye of houſhold. namely ſyth we be ſtrangers. & he a cytezyn. He dwelleth in his regyon. and we ben outlawes & pylgrymes. It is alſo grete Ieopardye to ſuſtene ſo ofte ſo contynuall & dayly conflyctes and batayles ayenſt the watches and ſubtyltees of dyſceyte of the deuyll the whiche is very ſubtyll: both by nature and alſo by longe excerſye & vſe of his malyce.
