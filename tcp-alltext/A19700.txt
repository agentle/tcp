                     In this Glasse if you will beholde
                     The Sterry Skie, and Yearth so wide,
                     The Seas also, with windes so colde,
                     Yea and thy selfe all these to guide:
                     What this Type meane first learne a right,
                     So shall the gayne thy trauaill quight.

            TO THE RIGHT HONORAble the Lorde Robert Duddeley, of the mooste noble Order of the Garter Knight, Maister of the Horse, to the Quenes moost excellente Maiestye: and his singuler good Lorde, and Maister. &c.
            
               DAEDALVS THAT EXcellent Geometrician (right honorable) whanas with the eyes of knowledge, he did beholde that horrible Mōster Ignorāce, he therwith praesently conceiued suche intollarable griefe, that he daily sought occasion ether how to banish hir his praesence and companye: or els by what meanes to escape, oute of her lothsome Labyrinthe. At lengthe, perceiuinge she coulde not be banished, he praepared winges (throughe Science aide) and so did flye oute of hir mooste filthy Prison: according to the pleasant Poëte.
            
               Daedalus fabrifactis alis Coelum ipsum adiuit.
               He made him winges wher with to flie:
               Ascending to the Sterrye Skie.
            
            Yea this Monster haue in all ages bene accompted so deformed and Vile, that those whose companye she frequented, were reputed not in the numbre of reasonable Creatures: but of brute beastes. For what doth man differ from a beast in nature, if he (leauing reasons rule) folowe his sensuall appetite as they do? Or wherein dothe he so neare approche vnto God in likenesse: as by Science, and Knowledge? for this thing is proper to God only, to know all thinges: and vnto beast to be in all things ignorant, except in such as ther senses and custome teach them. VVhich hathe ingendred such immortall hate towardes this lothsome wight, least man should lose his name and dignity, that he inuented all Artes, sought out all Secretes, and laboured throughe curiouse workes, to bring her into perpetuall exile. But nowe in these daies, lest she should returne againe (admonished by these examples) I though one of leaste strengthe and force, yet not of least good will, haue deuised this mirrour, or Cosmographical Glasse. In which, mē may behold not one or two personages, but the heauens with herplanets and starres, th▪Earthe with her beautifull Regions, and the Seas with her merueilous increse. So that she shal not (if men be diligent) creape into anye of these places, withoute espyeng. Yet considering

with my self, howe that Ignoraunce hath left no small number of her frendes among vs, which seke to deface both science and her seruants, I haue no other refuge to kepe this my Glasse from perishing, then to be an humble suter vnto your honoure (which doth not only fauour Science, but also haue geuen her within your breast a reastinge place) that it may come forth vnder your noble protection: and be defended as Teucer was vnder the shield of mighty Aiax, against two sortes of men especially. Of which, th'one will dispraise and despise such thinges as they neuer red, and are vtterly ignorante in. The other sorte will of mere arrogācy il report al mens trauailes, how exacte and perfite so euer they be, they them selues (like Dracns) remaininge withoute profite. As for the learned, wise, and modest, I am sure will not rashly geue sentence: but if faultes escape, eyther frendly admonishe: or els with penne spedely amende it▪ vnto whiche sute I am the more bouldened, remembring as well your excellent vertues, and giftes of nature, whiche for feare of suspicion of flatterye I ouerpasse, as to all men euident: as also your Lordshippes incoragement of me to knowledge, bothe in wordes and moost liberall rewardes. VVherefore, if it shall please your honore to take this simple worke into your tuition, and be Patrone vnto it: I shall be bouldened (God grauntinge life) to presente you also wyth other of my laboures, the Titles of whiche foloweth.

            THE PRAEFACE OF THE Author, setting out the dignitie, and Ample vse of Cosmographie.
            
               IF EVER THERE wer Art for all mēs vse inuented, Science set forth wherein consisteth Sapience, or Treasure worthy to be had in estimation: no doughte (louynge Reader) either Cosmographie is the same, or els it is not to be founde vppon th'Earth. For if we do well consider with oure selues what her office is, there is no man I suppose, so meane witted, but will confesse her ample vse, nor yet so simply learned but must acknowledge her manifold benefites. And if I shall begin with the defence of our Coūtry, which ought to be more praecious, thē Parentes wife Children or Consanguinitie, Cosmographie herein do so much profite, that without it both valeaunt Corage, Policy and Puisaunce oftentimes can take no place. For by her we are taught whiche way to conduct most safely our ooste, where to pitch oure tentes, where to winter: yea, and where most aptlye to encounter with them in the fielde. VVhich thing Alexander the mighty Conqueroure vnderstanding, accustomed to haue the Mappe and Carte of the Country, by his Cosmographers set out, with which he would warre. Commaunding it also to be hanged in open markets for all men to behold, wherby the Capitaines did for see, and seke out where was the easiest places to arriue, and the Souldiors allured with the commodities of the Countries, were made the willinger to the thinge. This was it which got him so many victories, and made him so great à Cōqueror. This was it which obteined the Romanes their fame, more then ther force and strength. This hathe bene to all men profitable, and iniurious to no man. On the contrarye parte, what domage, yea vtter subuertion hathe folowed to moste noble Princes, and valeaunte Capitaines throughe Ignorance of this Art, histories full well can testify.

And that amonge manye, I maye resight one Example, was not the mightye pertian King Cyrus (who had brought Babilon, and all the East partes in subiection) vanquished withall his armye of Tomyris the Scythiā Quene, at the Riuer Oaxis, as he shuld haue passed ouer? what shall I speake of Agamemnons armye in the Troian warres: of the Persians, against the Leonidians: or of Crassus, against the Partheans: whiche ware them selues destroyed, or made captiue, theyr wiues children and family spoyled, and theyr country most ruinously subuerted, for want of Cosmographie. Also, as touching the study of diuinitie, it is so requisite, and neadfull, that you shall not vnderstād any boke, ether of th' old law or Prophets (yea I had almost said, any part of à booke, or Chapter of the same) being in this Art ignoraunt. For what numbre of places, Ilands, Regions, Cities, Townes, Mountains, Seas, Riuers, and such like, is ther to be found in euery Booke? How often doth father Moses in his. v. bookes, make mention of Babilon, Sinehar, Armenia (in whose hilles, Noë his Arke stayed after the vniuersal deludge) Assur, Charan, Caphdorim or Caldaea, Aegipt called of the Hebrues Mizraim, Syria (deuided into thre parts, Mesopotamia, Arabia, and Aethiopia,) with infinite like places, whiche without Cosmographie can nether be rightly vnderstand, or yet trulye expounded? VVhat contention, and strife, haue ther spronge in all ages amonge th' Interpreters of the scriptures, touching the situatiō of Paradice: their owne workes moste euidentlye beare witnesse. All they agree in this poynt, that it is à place of ioy, reast, and abounding in all kinde of pleasures, but yet as touchinge the situation, some vnderstand it spiritually: some imagin it ether in heauen or in the harts of the quiet and faithfull: other affirme it à place in th'Earth at this praesent yet remaining, but is so kepte with Angels that no man maye come to it: some say it is in th' East part of the worlde, aboue the middle reagion of th' Aëre, and so is free from the violence of all windes. Other suppose it to be in the burning Zone, vnder th' Equinoctiall: So that not two in this poynt do accord. But yet of all the rest, ther opinions semeth most fond, whiche place it in the middle region of the Aëre, and also those, that vnderstand it spiritually, for that the scripture affirmeth it to be in th' Earth, and the. iiij famous floudes (Euphrates, Hidekel nowe called Tigris, Gihon, which many interprete Nilus, and Phison at this daye named Ganges (to come from thence.

These thinges I bring in only as example, to proue the necessarye vse of it in deuinitie, and not to dispute ether of Paradise or his situatiō, seing it belongeth not to my profession, and office. Moreouer mannes helth (withoute whiche Honour, Fame, Richesse, Frendes, and Life it selfe, semeth bothe troublous, and noysome) can not be conserued in perfite estate, or once lost be recouered and restored without Cosmographie. For howe greatlye herein it profiteth, to consider the temperature of Regions, Cities, and Townes, in what Zone, & vnder what Clymate and Parallele they are situated: Hippocrates dothe plainlye set out. Yea it might seme superfluous, to show how bothe he & Galenus, commaunded ther pacients to remoue from one place, to an other (especiallye in longe sickenesse) because of th' alteration of th' Aëre. VVhat it auaileth also, to know the natures of waters, the quality & pertition of windes, the maners & complexions of th' inhabitantes all Physicions right well do vnderstand. And to cōclude, in th' election of simples, as stones, treis, rotes, herbes, gummes, earthes, metals, beasts, foules, & fishes, what lighte springeth by consideringe the countrye from whence they are brought: I suppose no man of that profession, is ignorant. In the making, & ordaining lawes, for brideling mans froward appetide, Cosmographie is not vnfrutfull. For she setteth out the natures of all people, the lawes and statutes by which they are gouerned, & the sequele of euery decre established. Grammarians also, can not fullye vnderstande the pleasaunt inuention & perfite sence of the witty Poëtes, but by Cosmographies aide, because of the names of Regions, Cities, Townes, waters, fluddes, mountaines, ceremonies, people and monsters, which euery Poet do commenlye introduce, in all theyr writinges. I omit for breuitie, th' incredible benefits, whiche springe by reading of Histories: the beautye, & ornature of which, consisteth in the description of countreis, names of people, & nature of th' inhabitants: whiche remaine as vnknowne of th' inexperte of Cosmograghie. Moreouer, the famous marchaunts, haue by it not onlye inriched them selues, but also their country: fineding out suche commodities, as without it shuld remaine, as not knowne. Yea & that is daily more & more perceiued, for what countrie, or Iland, is not in oure age searched out? what shall I herein speake of Vesputius Americus, who (by his knowledge in Cosmographie) found out America, the .iiij. parte of the world, (vnknowne in all ages before our time) to the great benefites

of all Europe. I may seme to vtter that all men know, in making rehersall of th' Indians, Calicute, Ginea, the. v. Ilandes Moluccae, also Porne, Sololi, & infinite other, which are the frutes of Cosmographie in this our age. Mariners & trauailers on the seas (without which no realme can long stand, or mans life be sustaind) are bound to acknowledge Cosmographies benefites. For it setteth forthe there portes, it sheweth ther course, it declareth th' ordre of windes, it warneth them of rockes, shaloues, sandes, & infinite like dangers. In trauailing by land, her tables poynteth which way to folow, that thy iornay may be spedier, safe, short, & plesant, wher you shall ascend vp to hilles, wher to passe ouer waters, where to walke through woodes, and wher most aptly to remaine at night. If al these were not (as it serueth to infinite vses more then time will permit to repete,) yet this one were sufficiēt to kepe it in honor, that by it, in so small à lumpe, or piece of clay, beholding such strange formes of men, beastes, foules, and fishes: such diuersitie of times, such burning hilles, such merueilous stones, metalles & plants, we are inforced to confesse th' omnipotency, and wonderous worke of God. This is it, that prouoked Dioscorides to leaue cities, & townes, & trauail into deserts, & wods, to serch the nature of herbes This caused Atlas, Ptolomaeus, & Alfonce, to be so diligēt in setting out the heauens course, & forme of this earthly mansion. The vtilitye of this, alured Orpheus, Solon, Democritus, Pythagoras, Eudoxus, Plato, Hipparchus, Polybius, Strabo, & an hundreth more of the auncient Philosophers, to leaue their country, frends & acquaintāce, not doubting perel of the seas, dāgers of enemies, losse of substāce, werines of body: or anguish of mind. Yea the sweatnes therof was so great that Strabo after his trauails said, that if any arte were requisite for à Philosopher: it was Cosmographie. And Homer called Vlisses the wi sest among the Graecians, because he knew the natures of people, and the diuersitie of nations: Adding, that his eloquence, prudence, fortitude, constancye, & other like vertues (mete for à man) insued of hys perigrinations, & trauails, which remaining at home, he shuld neuer haue learned by any preceptes, discipline, or teacher. But seing diuers in oure age are desirous of knowledge no lesse then the Philosophers were, & yet can not trauaile for the discorde of nations, the sondrye sectes of people, and diuers other impedimentes, our refuge is, to saye with Propertius.

                  Constrained am I, and eke for to learne.
               
            
            In which, I had almoste (through making ouer much hast) forgotten to resight the benefits we receiue of Cosmographie: in that she deliuereth vs from greate and continuall trauailes. For in à pleasaunte house, or warme study, she sheweth vs the hole face of all th' Earthe, withal the corners of the same. And from this perigrination, thy wife with sheadinge salte teares, thy children with lamentations, nor thy frendes with wordes shal dehort & perswade the. In trauailing, thou shalt not be molested with the inclemencye of th' Aere, boysterous windes, stormy shoures, haile, Ise, & snow. Comming to thy lodginge, thou shalt not haue à churlish & vnknowne hoste, which shall mynister meate twise sodden, stinking fish, or watered wine. Going to rest, thou shalt not feare lowsy beddes, or filthy sheates. In Somer, the sōne with his fierye beames, shall not vexe thee: nor yet in winter, stormye Saturnus shal make thy beard frosen. In sayling, thou shalt not dread Pirates, feare Peries and greate windes, or haue à sicke stomacke through vnholsome smelles. Therfore these things considered, who is not incoraged to acheue suche an interprice, as shall redounde to his countries fame, & his perpetuall memorye? what wise man dothe not delite to reade such thinges, as Emperoures, Kinges & Princes haue painfully trauailed in, esteming ther labours plentuouslye rewarded, with the frute of this Art? But least these my wordes, should stirre vp the greadye appetides of diuers to this knowledge, & then to wante herein that mighte satisfie the same, beholde I haue compiled this my Cosmographical glasse. By which, such as are delighted in trauailing as well by land, as water, shal receiue no small comfort (If I be not deceiued) & th' other sort, by it may also protract, & set out perticuler cardes for anye countrye, Region, or prouince: or els th' vniuersall face of th' earth in à generall Mappe. Firste if they describe Parallele circles in the Mappe, answeringe to the like circles in the heauens: & by the right or croked Horizont, th' equinoctiall, polary circles, and altitude of the pole, to limite out the Zones, Climates, & Paralleles of Longitude, and Latitude: which being once praepared, you shall place there in the countries, hilles, fluddes, seas, fortresses, Ilandes, cities, desertes, & such like (according to the praecepts of th' art) as are placed on the platte forme of th' earthe. And that the praeceptes myghte

seme the more facile & plaine, I haue reduced it into the forme of à Dialoge: the names of the personages in dede fained, but yet most aptly seruing our institutiō. In which Spoudaeus (repraesenting the Scho ler) maketh doubtes, asketh Questions, obiecteth: yea, & some tyme, digresseth not from the fonde imaginations of the grosse witted. Vnto which, Philonicus (supplying th'office of à teacher) answereth to to all th'obiections, & giueth praeceptes. VVhat diligēce I haue giuen in time of the Printing, to the correction herof, and also in diuisinge sundry newe Tables, Pictures, demonstrations, & praeceptes: that you may easely iudge by readyng the same worke. Also what charges the Printer hath susteined, that his good will might not be wanting, that shalbe euident conferryng his beautiful Pictures & letters, with suche workes, as herto hath bene published. And thus I leaue the with my Cosmographicall Glasse, requiryng that these my trauayles & labours, be not rewarded with ingratitude, or ill reporte. And if for the difficultie of the worke, any errour escape: remember I am the firste that euer in oure tongue haue written of this argument, & therfore am constrained, to finde out the pathe. whiche if it be not at this time made plaine, smothe & pleasaunt: if God graūt life, & leisure, I trust so to treade it againe, that both night and day (walking in the same) thou shalt not misse of the desired Port. Againe fare well, & fauoure me, as I wishe thy furderaunce in knowledge.

I accompte my selfe happy, that I haue founde you: for now my hope is, to be deliuered (although not of all yet) of some of the bondes, and chaynes, of Ignoraunce.

And in reading certaine of them, I haue found not only matters of great difficultie: but also (as to me it semeth) of muche vntruthe.
            
            
               Philonicus.
               You must iudge well of their laboures whiche haue before our dayes written: for time bryngethThe olde wryters excused. thinges to their perfection. If we without any grounde, should by our vigilancie, fynde out suche misteries, yea and (as I may terme them) hid secretes of Nature: I assure you, we should haue left many more errours to our posteritie, then they haue in their writynges vnto vs. Yea and there are many thinges whiche seme false and vntrue: bycause the grosse capacities, of vnlearned persons, can not redely comprehende the same. But wherof doe those Authours intreate, in whiche you haue so latelye traueled?
            
            
               Spoudaeus.
               They be wryters of Cosmographie, Geographie, Hydrographie, or Nauigation. But because that ether they obserue no order, or Methode in their teaching, ether that they digresse from that they take in hande (and fyll their volumes with other sciēces,

rather then Cosmographie.) I haue very lyttle profyted by my trauell.
            
            
               Philo.
               I reioyce that your fortune was to take in hande suche authors. For Cosmographie in my iudgement is mete for euery estate, and moste excellent of all other naturall science. Wherfore be you nothing discomfortid, and amasyd with the difficultie of their wryting. For howe muche the thinge transcende in worthynes other knowledge not so plausible: so muche the more it is companion with dificultie. And where as you alleadge, that the most part of them obserue no Methode, and order: in that I will doe my indeuour, (as also in the other, where place shall require) to suplie that wante in that behalfe.
            
            
               Spoud.
               You shall meruailouslye incourage me, and take away the greatest trouble in this my study, if you do not only showe me the knowledge therof in suche order, as I may best conceiue it: but also explicate, and opē such placis, as are obscure and darke for me to vnderstande.
            
            
               Philo.
               Yet before we take in hande this studie, there is one thing, of whiche I must haue knowledge (that is) whether you haue redde any authours of Arithmetick,Arithmetick and Geometry necessary for this art. and Geometry: els you had best reade some of them, and resorte to me againe at some other conuenient season.
            
            
               Spoud.
               Yes sir I haue redde the ground of Artes, The whestone of wytte, and the path way.
            
            
               Philonicus.
               That I am glad to vnderstande: so shal it be the easier for me to instructe you, and you better to conceyue, and also retayne the surer, suche thinges as

shalbe taught. For he that wyll couer the roufe of his house, before he haue made the foundation, and buildyd the walles: besyde the losse of his cost, shall be thought scarse a wytty builder. But I wil exhort you as time shal seme mete also to reade with great diligence OrontiusOrontius. Scheubelius. Euclide. Theodosius. Arithmeticke, Scheubelius Algeber, Euclides Elemē
                  taries, and Theodosius of spherike Demonstrations: not only for this studies sake whiche you now haue in hande: but for all other artes (whiche taste of the Mathematicalles) that you shall here after trauell in. But nowe to the scope that you desire. And because that you maye knowe, wherof the matter depende of whiche we shall intreate, let me here what you call Cosmographie.
            
            
               Spoud.
               That semeth vnto me to be none other thing,What Cosmographie is. then the arte whiche doe set forth, and describe the vniuersall worlde.
            
            
               Philo.
               You haue sayd rightly, for so the Etymologie of this word Cosmographie doth sound. But is there no dife rence betwixt this worde Cosmographie, and Geographie?
            
            
               Spoud.
               It should so seme to me, for both do describe the worlde.
            
            
               Philo.
               Then define you Geographie, after suche authours myndes as you haue redde.
            
            
               Spoud.
               That wyll I doe gladly. Ptolomaeus in his geographieLib. 1. cap. 1. defineth it in this sorte.
               
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .What Geographie is.
                  
               
               Whiche sentence I turning into Latyne soundith in this sorte.
               
                  Geographia est vniuersarum terrae partium cognitarū, vnà cum hiis, quae ei veluti vniuersaliter coniuncta sunt, picturae imitatio.
               
               
               Whiche in our tongue is as muche to saye as.
               
                  Geographie is the imitation, and discriptiō of the face, and picture of th'earth, with her partes knowen, and of such things as are to it cō
                     nected and ioyned.
               
            
            
               Philo.
               You haue truly repetyd Ptolomaeus wordes. Now I wyll proue by your difinition, that you haue erred two wayes, in putting no diference betwixt Cosmographie, and Geographie. First Cosmographie teachethThe diference of Cosmographie and Geographie. the discriptiō of the vniuersal world, and not of th'earth only: and Geographie of th'earth, and of none other part.
            
            
               Spoud.
               Why syr, make you a diference betwixt the worlde, and th'earth?
            
            
               Philo.
               Yea verely, and that as much as betwixt a mā, and his litle finger, but of that, you shal heare more or we departe. The seconde way you erryd in the order of diuiding th'earth: for albeit Cosmographie describeth the face of th'earth, yet it is by noting and obseruing certaine diuisions, answering vnto. v. principal paralleles or equidistant circles in the heauens. As they dwell in the middes of th'earth that inhabit vnder th'equinoctiall lyne, and the like of the dwellers vnder th'other circles, is said On th'other parte, Geographie doe deliniat, and set out the vniuersal earth, no respect had vnto the fornāed circles of the heauēs: but by Hylles, Moūtayns, Seas, fluddes, and such other notable thinges, as are in it cōteined.
            
            
               Spoud.
               Then by your wordes I also gather, there is some diference betwyxt these two, and Chorographie.
            
            
               Philo.
               Yea and that Ptolomaeus in the place of youWhat Chorographie is and howe it difereth from the other two. alleadgid, do playnly expresse. For lyke as Cosmographie describeth the worlde, Geographie th'earth: in lyke sorte

Chorographie, sheweth the partes of th'earth, diuided in themselues. And seuerally describeth, the portes, Riuers Hauens, Fluddes, Hilles, Moūtaynes, Cities, Villages, Buildinges, Fortresses, Walles, yea and euery particuler thing, in that parte conteined. And is in respect saith he, of Cosmographie and Geographie, as if a paīter shuld set forth the eye, or eare of a man, and not the whole body, so that Chorographie consisteth rather in describyng the qualitie and figure, then the bignes, and quantitie of any thinge.
            
            
               Spoud.
               Although by your wordes, I haue receiued more commoditie at this present, then by all my readyng touching the true diference of these three names: yet if itThinges seene are lenger in mynde, then only harde. may please you to geue me the figures of euery of them, I shall so stedfastly printe it in my mynde, as I truste not to forget them, for it is truly said, thinges sene haue longer impresion then only harde.
            
            
               Philo.
               I wyll gladly fulfill your request. Marke nowe this example folowing. Here first you do see the heauens conteine in them th'earth. Whiche earth is deuided into fiue principall partes, accordinge to the fiue Circles in the heauens: the names of whiche for breuitie I omytte vntyll conuenient place, lest thorowe oftē repeting things thei at length seme tedious. The

other fygure without circles, representeth th'earth, set forth with Waters, Hylles, Mountaynes, and such like.
               
                  
                     This Picture aunswereth vnto Geographie.
                  
               
               And finally for Chorographie, I haue placed th'excellēt Citie of Norwyche, as the forme of it is, at this present 1558. Nowe that you haue learned their difference, declare in which of thē you most delight to be instructed.
            
            
               Spoud.
               I thanke you syr, I shall neuer be able (more then with praier) to recompence your paynes. But senceCosmographie excelleth Geographie and Chorographie. Cosmographie is more excellent then the other two, both for the manifolde vse, and that it cōteineth and comprehendeth the other in it selfe: I would imploye my whole industrie herein.
            
            
               Philo.
               Then seing that Cosmographie describeth the worlde as you haue sayde, (and that rightly) it is necessary to know what the world is, what the partes of it are,The argumēt of the whole worke. and how many, yea and finally, by what meanes, as well the world, as also the partes of it, ar described. This perfitly lernyd, haue you then for this present, your whole desire?
            
            
               Spoud.
               Yes verely.

               Then let vs beginne with the definitionLib. primo in initio. of the worlde, whiche the auncient Cleomedes definith in this maner.

                     .What the Worlde is.
                  
               
               And I do translate it into Latine as foloweth.
               
                  Mundus est ex caelo, terra

                  That is, the world is an apte frame, made of heauen, and earth, & of thinges in them conteyned. This comprehēdeth all thinges in it self, nether is there any thing without the lymites of it visible.
               
               Whiche definition differith not from Aristotle and otherAristotle. famous writers. So that what so euer is betwixt the seate of the almighty gouernour of all lyuing creatures, and the center of the earth: is called the worlde. And is compared to à round ball and globe.
            
            
               Spoudaeus.
               Then all that we ether by syght may decerne, or by arte conceiue, that same is the worlde. And conteyneth in it what so euer the eternall Creater, by his wounderfull worke haue in this circuit blessed, and made.
            
            
               Philonicus.

               Then I perceiue my error before cōmitted,The Worlde and the earth not one thing. wheare I applied this worde worlde, only to the earth.
            
            
               Philonicus.
               So in lyke sorte it is otherwayes abused, but note you diligently that is saide before of Cleomedes and it shalbe sufficient.

And so there may be (yea and you wyll). xx. diameters, or as many as you please in a sphere: but there can be but one axe tree, on whiche the sphere, or globe, is reuoluid. And this axe tree is voyde of all motion.

               Here I wyl make a sphere, in whiche I drawe right lines, frō the one part of the circūferēce, by the cēter, & so to th' other. Such right lines, or diameters, are AD: CF: BE: but I do imagine only A. D. to be the axe tree, and imoble.
               
                  
               
            
            
               Philo.
               Very wel wrought. Now procede we forth. You must also consider that the sphere is deuided, into a right sphere and into an oblique or crokyd sphere.

they only haue a right sphere which dwell vnder th' equinoctiall,The spheare is taken two wayes. A right sphere The poles of the worlde what thei are. and haue both the pole arctike, and antarctick in their Horizont.
            
            
               Spoud.
               Do you not call the two pointes or endes of the axe tree, the fornamed poles?
            
            
               Philo.
               It is so, and for firmer printing it in memory, beholde here the type of them that haue a right sphere. As A. D. C. representeth bothe the axe tree, and the right Horizont: and A. C. the two poles: Yea and B. D. the half parte of th' equinoctiall.
               
                  
               
            
            
               Spoud.
               So that a mā inhabiting vnder B. D. which is th' equinoctial, do perceiue both A. whiche is the North pole, and C. whiche is the South, leuell with th' earth, and his verticall point, in the for said Aequinoctial.
            
            
               Philo.
               You do well perceyue it.

               Then it foloweth, that where ether of the poles, is eleuated aboue th' earth, they dwell not vnder theAn oblique or croked sphere. aequinoctial, and so haue a croked, & an oblique sphere.

               And that doe this figure perfitly proue. Here C. E. is the halfe of the axe tree aboue th' earth, B. E. is the halfe of th' equinoctial. C. the one pole aboue th' earth. Whiche maketh the halfe sphere. A. B. C. D. to be oblique, and croked, according to my first meanīg.

               You hit the naile on the head (as the saying is)The Horizont deuided into two partes. Nowe your authour deuideth the horizont, lyke to the sphere: that is, into à ryght horizont, and into â croked or oblique.

               They haue a right horizont, whan as this circle crosseth th' equinoctiall rightely in two partes, and they haue a croked horizont, whan eyther of the PolesA croked Ho rizont. is aboue th' Earth, and th' other vnder: suche is oure Horizont whiche inhabit Europe. But for the better vnderstanding, I haue made here a figure, in whiche C. A. and E. is th' equinoctiall. And because B. A. D. crosseth

it rightely: It is the right Horizont. Also B. D. are the two Poles of the worlde: & because B. is eleuated aboue th' earth, it maketh F. A. G. to be th' obliquè Horizont, as these ij. pictures here placed do shewe.

               Seyng that the Horizont semeth onely necessary for to know the true risinge, & goynge downe of the Sonne, Mone, Planetes, & fixed sterres, it can not any thynge helpe for to knowe whan anye of them are at the hiest aboue the Horizont for that daye, in whiche place whan as the Sonne cōmeth: it is midday. For I perceiue euery Planet, & Starre, to ascende by litle, & litle aboue th' earth, vntyll they be at the hiest: & then in lyke maner do continuallye descende, vntill they come to the Horizont in the West.

                  The meridiane or middaie circle (saith he) is describid and drawen by the poles of the worlde, and the point directlye ouer oure heades called Zenit Zenit is that point or prick imagined to be directly ouer our heades & is alwaye. 90. degrees frō the East, South, Weast, and North. Lib. 1. prop. 3. in whiche whan the Sonne entreth (whiche is twyse in a naturall day) it is mydday, or mydnight.

               Yea and this meridiane by Theodosius probation, shall in all places crosse rightly the Horizont, & is also a fixid circle as the Horizont is.
            
            
               Philo.
               And that was one of the greatest reasons (if I be not deceiued) whiche prouoked the Astronomers to make their computation from midday. And as many as dwell either plaine North, or South, haue the same meridiane that you haue: and suche as are either East, or West, haue an other meridian, and not the same whiche you haue.
            
            
               Spoud.
               Then by your wordes I gather that the inhabitantes whiche be directly vnder vs (the GeographersAntipodes. name them Antipodes) are vnder the same meridiane lyne, that we be.
            
            
               Philo.
               Verely it is true. But we wyll omyt the declaration of them vntyll our next metinge, and I wyll gyue you example of the meridiane circle, ioyned with the Horizont. Here you se A. E. C. represent

                  
the verticall point, B. D. the poles of the world, by whiche and A. (being the vertical circle) is the meridiā circle A. B. C. D. delineated and drawē. Whiche crosseth also B. E. D. F. being the Horizont circle.
            
            
               Spoud.
               This circle I do wel remembre, but I do furder perceiue that the Sōne riseth not alway at one time, and therfore is sometime longer or he come to the meridian, and sometime shorter, so that the daies increase and decrease continually, except twyse euery yeare. (Which is to saye the. x. of Marche, and the. xiiij. of Septēber) and then the daies, and nightes are equall, and he ryseth directly East, and setteth playne West: whiche in other times, he do not, as we may dayly vnderstande.
            
            
               Philo.
               The diference of the tymes, ingendred by the course of the Sonne, you shall easely fynde by th' quinoctiall.

                  Th' equinoctiall is a circle greatest of all th' other. v. Paralleles, and is so deuided, and parted of the Horizont, that th' one halfe is euer aboue th' earth, and th' other halfe vnder: into whiche, whan the Sonne enter (whiche is twyse yearly spring tyme, and haruest) the dayes and nightes are equall thorowe the whole earth.

               Moreouer you must further consider that this circle difereth from the other two afore said because it is mouable, and caried about with the heauens, where the other are stedfast and fixid.

               Yes verely, and they that dwell vnder th' equinoctiall haue the signes equally ascending, and descending, whiche should not be, if the poles of it, did varie frō the poles of the worlde. That they do ascende, and also descend equally, Lucan th' excellent Poet, do aptly set out, where he describeth Cato his voyage into Lybia,Lib. 9. which is towarde th' equinoctial, in these versis annexid.

Nowe further more you maye consyder, that lyke as the rising, and going downe of the Sonne, Moone, and Planetes, is founde out by the helpe of the Horizont: their true height by the meridian circle: and the varietie of tyme by th' equinoctiall: (comparing the quantitie of the daye present, vnto the quantitie of the day whan as the Sōne is in th' equinoctial) so there is also a proper path, or way, in whiche the other Planetes, as well as the Sonne do finyshe their reuolutiō, and course, according to their true tyme. Whiche circle is very nedefull for Geographers, as hereafter you shall vnderstande.

This Zodiack, extendith vnto two equidistant circles, or paralleles. That is to say the somer tropike, in the beginning of Cancer: and the winter in the beginning or first degree of Capricorne. The latitude and bredth of the Zodiack is. xij. degrees, and it is called thwarte or croked, because it crosseth the parallele circles.
               
               And here you must note for eschewing further error, that th' author menith by crossinge the parallele circles, that the zodiack goeth ouerthwarte them, and not rightly as th' equinoctiall, and the right Horizont doth.

first institution. But I wil geue you here a table of many notable fixed starres, which are profitable for the trieng out of the latitude of any country and place.
            
            
               Spoud.
               This table seruith vnto smal vse (if my authors deceiue me not) onlesse that I haue in lyke sorte the declination of them.
            
            
               Philo.
               You saye ryghtly, and to satisfie your expectation, I wyll also place here a table of declination of theclipticke lyne from th'equinoctiall, whiche shall extende vnto. 23. digrees. 28. minutes, the trew declination of the sonne, of this our age.
            
            
               Spoud.
               I pray you sir, what call you the declination of the sonne, or other planet and sterre?
            
            
               Philo.
               It is no other thing then the distaunce of anye sterre from th'equinoctial vnto his true place in the zodiack. And here marke that euery sterre hath two decliEuery Planet haue two decli nations. nations, the one is hauing ther course in the zodiack frō the beginning of Aries, vnto th'ende of Virgo, and they are North frō th'equinoctial. Th'other from the beginning of Libra, vnto th'ende of Pisces, and they are said to haue their declination south from th'quinoctiall.
            
            
               Spoud.
               haue this declination of the sonne, bene alway one, or it doth varie?
            
            
               Philo.
               I wyll shewe you, in the tyme of Ptolomaeus as (his workes do testifie) the sonnes greatest declination from th'equinoctiall was. xxiij. degrees. lj. minutes, andThe diuersitie of the Sonnes declinatiō, frō Ptolomaeus time, vnto our age. xxx. secondes. Almaeon found it .xxiij. degrees .xxxiij. mynutes, and .xxx. secondes. Iohannes de monte Regio, tried it to be .23. and but .30. minutes. And George Pour

bachius .23. degr. & .28. mi. which agreeth with our time
            
            
               Spoud.
               This diuersitie of obseruatiō, may arise rather of the instrumentes not exactly made, then that he do so vary in his declination.
            
            
               Philo.
               Nay verely. I attribute the cause here of vnto that mouing of the heauē which is called of Tebitius & Alfonsus, motus trepidationis.
            
            
               Spoud.
               How may I finde this varietie of declination, by myne owne diligence.
            
            
               Philo.
               Although it vary not in a mans lyfe any thing sensible, yet because you may both know the obseruing of it exactly and also teache other that hereafter shal lerne as you are now instructed your selfe: I wil in fewe wordes open the whole labour. Take a quadrant (the making ofHow to finde out by Instrument the Sonnes Declinatiō
                   whiche you shal see among the other instrumentes) and and set it directly vpright vpon some playne in the meridian lyne (the finding of whiche you shal see in the next treatise) and is here marked A. B. as also C. A. dore present, the zenit or verticall point, then rayse vp and downe the ruler (hauing two sight holes made in it) vnto the sonne, whan as he is in the meridian line: and obserue diligētly that height, in the circle of degrees noted in your quadrant, frō B. to C. the .xi. or .xii. day of Decē
                  ber, which is B. D. vntill you finde he goeth no lower: and againe in like case the .xi. or .xij. of Iune, vntyll you perceiue he increaseth nothinge in height, and is noted here B. E. and so the distaunce of D. E. is the distaunce of the .ij. tropick Circles.
            
            
               Spoud.
               What meane you by those tropick circles?
            
            
               
               Philo.
               You shall knowe, our conclusion ended. This distaunce in our dayes is founde .46. degrees .56. minutes,

which beyng parted in two equall parts, & reconed from th' Equinoctiall. B. F. sheweth the Sonnes greatest declination Northwarde from the forsaid Circle, 23. degrees .28. minutes. And in like case Southwarde in Winter. And thus shall you alwaies find his declination.
            
            
               Spoud.
               This rule will I put in practise whan the tyme of the yeare doeth insewe.

               Philo.
               I will fulfill your request. The poles of the zodiacke, do muche differ from the poles of th'equinoctiall, as you may easely perceiue by this figure here placed. In which I haue made C. H. E. I. for th'equinoctial:

                  . H. G. I. for the zodiacke, and A. for th'earth. Now if I make B. D. the poles of th'equinoctiall as they must nedes be: thē can thei not be the poles of the zodiack, as herafter you shal heare, but K. L. being the endes of th'axe tree of the sayd zodiack, shall be the poles.

               Yea and that right gladly, vsing Proclus autho ritie as in the other circles whiche saith.

                  The Somer Tropick (saith Proclus) is the most northely circle which the Sonne describeth, in to whiche whan as he enterith, it is the longest daye, and shortest nyght in all the yeare. For after this somerlye reuerting, the Sonne is not perceiued to decline farther North, but directly to the contrary coost: for which cause this circle is called a tropike (or circle of reuerting and turning back.)
               
            
            
               Spou.

               The wynter tropike or circle of retorning from the South: as these his wordes folowyng do testifie.

                  The tropick of winter, is the furdest south circle of al other that y• sonne by the tournynge of the world doth describe: into whiche whan he doth enter, he maketh his wynterly retorne backwarde, at which season it is the lōgest night in all the yeare, and shortest day. For after this retourne, the sonne goth not further south, but doth approche to the contrary part of the worlde: for whiche cause, this circle also was called a tropicke circle.
               
            
            
               Spo.
               Proclus here meaneth (as by the repetitiō of his wordes I gather) that these two tropikes, ar as it wer the boūdes, & lēgth of the Sonnes iournay. For goyng from the Sommer tropicke in the begynning of the Crabbe, he directeth his course in the zodiacke towardes Libra in th'equinoctiall: and so leuing it, draweth vnto the Wynter Tropicke in the begynnyng of the Goate, beyonde which he can not goe, but retourneth backward agayne,

vntyll he cum to the head of the Ramme.
            
            
               Philo.
               It is so, and by these wordes you maye also gather,The foure tymes of the yeare whereof they take beginning. that the. iiij. tymes of the yeare, Spryng, Sommer, Haruest, and Wynter, haue their beginnīg in these. iiij. pointes (that is) the two Aequinictiall pointes, and the tropickes.
            
            
               Spoud.
               You haue here iust occation to speake of the diuersitie of daies, and nightes, and it please you.
            
            
               Philo.
               Yet that shalbe omittid vntill we make mentiō of clymates, and the paralleles: and at this present wyll speake of these circles whiche do deuide as wel Th'equinoctiall, as also the zodiacke, into. iiij. equall partes: so that the Sonne being in any of them do make one of the forsayde tymes.
            
            
               Spou.
               These circles also are necessarye, but what are their names?
            
            
               Philo.
               They are called Colures, of which th'one is drawen by the beginning of Aries and Lybra, and of that is named th'quinoctiall Colure, and th'other by the beginning of cancer, and Capricorne, and called therof the solstitiall Colure, and are definid of Proclus in this maner.

                  There are circles drawen by the poles (whiche some men call) Colures: and conteine in their circumference the Poles of the worlde, & they be named Colures, or trunckid circles, for this consideration, because that some partes of them are not at any tyme sene. The other circles by the turninge of the worlde are all apparantly seene: but some partes of the colures, be neuer decernyd. Suche are these partes as are vnder our Horizont in the circle Antarctike. These circles also are drawne by the. ij. tropike pointes, deuiding the eclipticke in two equall partes.

As for heate and couldnes, are so repugnaunt that ther can be no mixture of them: no more then of moisture & drynes.

               It is truely said, that knowledge hath no enemie but ignoraunce. There are nowe at these daies, no small numbre of Lactantius sort, not scrupulous enemies onely, but also Physicians, of whome I am ashamed to speake, & they do contempne that knowledge (whiche is the greatest & suerist token of Gods prouidence for mankind) either by peruerse interpreting the scripture, or els of mere follie, dispisinge that, of whiche they neuer tasted, & are vtterly ignorant in. But such wer very ill to be Iudges, for they would condemne the man, or they

knew the crime of whiche he were accused: but let that passe. As touchyng your opinion, that th'Earth is flat, I will proue it to be rounde from th'East to the West: and in like maner, from the North, to the South.
            
            
               Spou.
               Then must I nedes graūt that it is in like sorte rounde in all partes.In lib. 1. de Mundo.
               
            
            
               Philon.
               I wyll vse the same argumētes that Cleomedes doeth. If th'Earth were flat, then the sterres should rise at the same moment to vs, that they do to them whiche dwell in th'East parts of the world: & it should be midday with vs, & them at one instaunt: yea & the same Starres should set in the Weast in lyke maner with thē, and vs.
            
            
               Spoud.
               That they do not, I am most sure: for at Alexādria, à citie in Egipt, it is day iij. houres sooner then with vs: & night in like sorte. Yea & at Compostell in Spaine (which is West from vs) the daye begynneth with vs sooner by one houre & a halfe, then with them: and is daye with them, after the Sonne is set with vs, in like sort one houre, & xxx. minutes.
            
            
               Philo.
               And all this cometh, because th'Earth is round, causing vs & them not to haue one generall Horizont. The like reason is to be said of the diuersities of times, in the beginning of an Eclipse, either of Sonne, or Mone. As for exāple, th'Eclipse of the Mone, which was 1556.Example of ij. Eclipses of the Moone. the 17. day of Nouēber, at one of the clocke in the morning, with vs at Norwiche, (& for the moste parte of Englande) which in the Horizont of Calicut, began at vij. of the clock. In like sort, ther shall happē an Eclipse of the Mone, in the yeare of Christ our sauior. 1562. the

16. daye of Iuly, at two of the clocke, iiij. minutes in the morning: at which time she shalbe totallie darkened, & continew from the beginning to th'ende iij. houres, and yet th'inhabitauntes at Calicut, shall not see anye parte therof: whiche moste euidently sheweth the roundnes of th'Earth to be the cause, as this Figure here folowing do more plainely set out: in which, E. signifieth th'Earth: A. the East: C. the West: D. the verticall pointe for Norwich: & B. in like maner, the Zenit of Calicut. Wherby it is manifest that the Mone shalbe perfitly seperated from the Sonne, or she shall appeare in the Horizōt of Calicut. And yet we in England, & diuers other places East, shall se bothe beginning, & ende of her Eclypsing.
               
                  
               
            
            
               Spoud.
               These are sufficiēt probatiōs to declare th'Earth roūd, frō th'East to the West: but by what argument can you shewe it to be also rounde from the South to the North?
            
            
               Philo.
               That is very easie to proue. For if th'Earth were flat from the South, to the North, then we should se the south Sterres vnder th'Earth: as well as those that be North alway in our sight. And againe, the Sonne, Mone, & Sterres, at midde day through the vniuersal yere, should be euer in one height: which also is false.
            
            
               Spoud.
               Yea, for I haue had practise of that thinge,

saylinge in à shippe, for we goynge from th'Equinoctiall Line northwarde, did see the North, & south Poles, equall with the Water. But directing our course more to the north coast, & leauing th'Equinoctial, we reared the north starre in short space. xij. degr. & at lēgth, 30. deg. & loking south, we could not se the southe Pole, nor yet many other sterres which in th'Equinoctial, were visible to vs.
            
            
               Phi.
               Yea, & wher your north starre was eleuated xxx. degrees, your south Pole was xxx. degrees depressed in like maner: But for the firmer fixynge it in your memory, behould this Figure: in the which C. signifieth both th'Earth, and water, A. the north Pole, & B. the south, therefore if one go from B. to A (the earth being roūd) he must haue B. so muche vnder him, as A is aboue his Horizōt. There are besides these many, & sūdry reasons, to proue this thing: which I may omit (as I suppose) to you, which nede no lenger probatiō, in that whiche is most manifest.

For some time Morphêus shewed me the Sonne, in the tropicke of Capricorne,Whā the Sōne is in the Tropick of Capricorne. In both Aequi noctiall pointes. farre in the South, among the cloudye skies, as he comenly is the. 13. day of December: And next he appered in th' Equinoctiall pointes, as it is the tenth daye of March, and the. 14. of Septēb. willing me with great di ligēs to note that parallele circle. Shortly after the sōne appeared in the tropicke of Cancer, in whiche place he isIn the Tropick of Cancer. the. 12. daye of Iune, causing in our region the lōgest day in the yere. & imediatly the time semed as it were midnight, & Charles Wayne, with Bootes, & diuers other sterres, turned about the Pole.

Mercury the messenger of the Godes came to my bedde side, & saide, Aurora did appeare, & Phebus with his goldē beames, was entred his chariot, minding to finishe his diurnall Arcke: so that it was à reproche for me, any lōger to play the sluggard: declaringe more ouer that Philonicus was in the fildes. And surely I suppose no lesse, but I shall not from him be longe absent. I am iustly reprehended of Mercury, because the time that is cōsumed with slepe more then nature requireth, is all lost: for ther spring no profit therof, but sicknes & disquietnes, both of body & minde. But what is he that calleth Spoudaeus, & beckneth with his hand? It is Philonicus. I will make spede to mete him.

               That signification of Lōgitude, is vsed amongLongitude taken two waies th' Astronomers: but in Cosmographie it is otherwise. For they call the Longitude of any Region, the portion of th' Equinoctiall Circle, which is included betwixte the Canarian Ilandes, (in the West beyng the first degre of Longitude) & the Meridiane of the Regiō, that thou wilt describe. Such portiō of th' Equinoctiall in the middes of Englande (from the fornamed Ilandes) is about xxij. degrees.

               You haue trewly sayd, if ther were none other way to atteine to it, thē by traueling about it: but it shalbe sufficient to haue traueled any portiō of this great circuit.

               By what meane shall I finde out the vertical pointThe verticall Poynte, Zenit or Pole of the Horizont, is so much distance from the Equinoctiall, how much the Pole is eleuated aboue the Horizōt. And like as the meridian, euer do describe the Northe and Southe costes: so dothe the verticall Parallele, the East and West.?

               It is equall to the Pole Arctike (the finding of whiche, hereafter I will teache you) & you maye vse th' one for th' other: thē you also in like maner must know the distaunce in miles of these places, after diuid the distaunce of the two places, by the differēce of the two verticall pointes, & the quotiēt shall shew you howe manye miles do answere to one degree of the saide Circle in the Heauēs. But or we further proced, marke this figure, in which C. is th' earth, A. B. the distaunce of two placis in th' Earth, D.

Therefore diuiding the. 330. miles (which is the portiō of th' Earth, answering the differēce of these 2. Eleuatiōs) by the 5. degrees, & 30. minutes, which is the difference: I find the

                        The middest of thē all men eschew, the burning is so fell.
                        In the zones next the Poles through could, no creature long maye dwell.
                        Bitwixt these, & the burning Zone, two other se you may,

               Philo.
               Well, bycause I will not haue you to erre withThe Answer. Poëtes, & other that suppose these not habitable, I will take the more diligence to driue this Heresie out of yourPtolomaeus. Auicenna. heade, & althoughe Ptolomaeus, & Auicenna were of sufficient authoritie, to make you credit this thing, affirminge that they haue sene men whiche did inhabite betwixt th' Equinoctiall, & the tropike of Cancer: yea, & that, ther ar many notable Cities, & Villages: yet I wil vse other reasons then testimonies in this behalfe. And first answer me: Is not the heate of the Sōne cause (that in the Sūmer ceason he inclining toward our habitatiō) that mens colour in ther faces & hādes are made blacker, then naturally they are?
            
            
               Spoud.
               Yes verely: & I haue sene some dwellers in litle Vilages, as Plowmen, Heardmen, & Shepehards maruelously sonneburnt.
            
            
               Philon.
               What wil you cōiecture then of those people that are blacke, face, body & all externe partes of them, doeth it not come of the heate of the Sōne?
            
            
               Spoud.
               It muste nedes so be, and I haue sene men of that colour, & we call them

Aethiopians.
            
            
               Philo.
               Very well, & do not you beleue that the countrey where they dwell, must of force be vnder the beames of the Sōne?
            
            
               Spou.
               Els it could not folow that ther colour should so much differ frō ours.
            
            
               Philon.
               And there is no place vnder the perpendiculer Sōne beames, but only this burning Zone: & Ara bia (sumwhat frō the Sōne beames situated) is the cause that th' inhabitauntes, are not so blacke as the Aethiopians: nor the Spaniardes, as th' Arabians: or Frēchmē, as the Spaniardes.
            
            
               Spoud.
               And the Germaynes haue their skinne whiter then the Frenchemen: & we here in Englande, then all these: so that the furder from this burninge Zone, the whiter the skie: and the nerer th' Equinoctiall, the blacker, & more adust & burnt.
            
            
               Philo.
               Moreouer the Nauigatiō to Calicute, (ofVesputius Columbus. which voiage Vesputius, & Columbus were the first authors, & nowe more frequented of the spanierdes, then sayling into coūtreis nie adiacēt to vs) do witnes beare, that vnder this burning Zone there are inhabitaūtes.
            
            
               Spou.
               by these wordes it is manifest, that the burning Zone is not habitable onely, but also inhabited. And as touchinge the temperate Zones, no man is so folishe, or madde, as to denie them to be replenished with all liuing creatures abūdantly: wherfore if you can proue that the two Zones, next the Poles are also habitable, you shall as farre banish this errour frō me, as the Sōne doth darkenes.
            
            
               Philoni.
               Although Ptolomaeus do not describe any parallele beyonde Thylim, whiche is two degr. & more of this side of the Circle Arctike. And

that for the situatiō of it, farre distant from the beames of the sonne, and therfore the Waters cōtinually frosen and th'Earth with Snow couered: Yet Erasmus ReignholtErasmus Reignholt. (and that truley) describeth a Parallele by Hielso, an Ilād in Norway which is. 9. degrees beyonde the polary or Arctike circle. Also the grene lande, and in diuers countreis there inhabited, and the inhabitants are called in Greke

               Spo.
               Then I perceiue that both the burning zone, & also the frosen are habitable and not that only, but also inhabited, although not so plentifullye as the temperate zone. But nowe sence ther is offered good occasion to intreat of shadowes, and their diuersitie▪ yea and the place serueth aptly for it, or we do further procede. Wherfore I require you, to turne our cōmunicatiō to this matter.

               With a right willing mind. You must first vnderstād that of the diuersitie of shadowes, ther ar. iij. diuers distinct habitatiōs of people found, that is to say, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . whiche names also the latinest vse, Amphiscij, Heteroscij, Periscij, & we wāt apt English termes for them, yet I will make it plain thoughe I vse the more wordes. And first I wil speke of those which we call Amphiscij. You do marke wel that the sonnes course, &Amphiscij. recourse continuallie in the Zodiak maketh the shadow long, and short?
            
            
               Spou.
               I know that well, and the nerer he cometh toward vs, the shorter is the shadow, and the furder he goeth frō vs, the lōger he geueth a shadow.
            
            
               
               Philo.
               It is so as you say. But how thinke you, is ther not some place that hath no shadow?
            
            
               Spoud.
               There can be no such.
            
            
               Philo.
               If the greatest declination of the Sonne from th'Equinoctiall nere to the zenit, & ver ticall poynt, make the shadow shortest that can be in thy region: then where he goeth ouer any zenit, there muste be no shadow.
            
            
               Spou.
               It should seme to follow.
            
            
               Phil.
               Yea it muste of necessitie so be.
            
            
               Spoud.
               But where is there any such, ouer whose heades the Sōne directly goeth?
            
            
               Philo.
               Suche be those that dwell in the burning Zone, which (as I said) is betwixt the two Tropikes, so that when the Sonne is in the beginning of Aries, and Libra, they haue no shadowe, and thereforeAscij hath two Somers & two Winters. lib. 9. Plinius calleth thē 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Ascij, or people withoute shadow. And because he is twise yerely in these poynts, thei haue two sommers, and in like case two winters, for that he declineth to the Tropikes of Cancer, and Capricorne.Libro. 9. Wherfore Lucanus spake of such inhabitants very aptly, in this these verses following.
               
                  
                     
                        Depraensum est hunc esse locum, quo circulus alti

                        This is the place where th'Equinoctiall diuides
                        The Zodiake in twaine, causinge two Somer tides.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               Spoud.
               I remember that Ptolomaeus in his AlmegistLib. 2. cap. 4. maketh mention of such inhabitantes, and nameth also such as dwel vnder the tropikes Ascij, but yet I shuld not haue called it to mind if you had not geuē th'occatiō.
            
            
               Philo.
               Yet thys people whan as the sonne declyneth Northward from them, haue a shadow, which shadow falleth at none stede directlye southe (for of other shadowes

I make no accompte).
            
            
               Spoud.
               It must neades so be, for the sōne is North frō that thing which geueth the shadowe.
            
            
               Philon.
               And whan the sonne is in the winter poynt, vnto what coste do the shadowe decline?
            
            
               Spoud.
               It shall fall directly North by the reason of you aleaged.
            
            
               Philo.
               Here then you se the cause wher of these inhabitauntes were called Amphiscij, and we maye call them double or two folde shadowed.
            
            
               Spou.
               I vnderstand your meaning.
            
            
               Philon.
               TheHeteroscij. second be those, which haue the shadow continuallye, toward one coste, ether North or South.
            
            
               Spou.
               Then we be in the numbre of those, for we haue oure shadow directly North.

               And such be those that dwel in th' opposite place ofAntipodes. th' earth against vs (& therfore called Antipodes. For the so ne neuer comminge ouer their zenit, they haue the shadow into the South coste perpetually declining, as we haue into the Northe.
            
            
               Spou.
               This muste nedes be certainly true, but yet I do much meruaile therat.

               What so euer is rare, and not commonly sene and hard, is euer meruelous. And the Arabians commynge into Europe, meruailed as muche to see the shadowe Northwarde, as you do to here it is declined (with the aforesaid inhabitants) toward the South cost, & therfore Lucanus speaketh of them in this sort.Lib. 3.

                        A Region vnknowne (Arabians) you finde:
                        Musing that the shadow, is still North declinde.

               There remaineth yet to speke of the thirde sort of people which you named Periscij.
            
            
               Phil.
               They tokePeriscij. that name because thei (dwelling within the circles arctike & Antarctike) haue the shadow going round about the Horizont.
            
            
               Spou.
               But yet the shadowe moueth not so swiftlye aboute th' Earth with them, as it doeth with vs (and those you call Amphiscios) for wyth vs it goeth about from the West by the Northe, & so to the East in the space (that the sonne is in oure Hemisphere, & aboue th' earth, whiche at the most is in. xvij. houres.

               It is so.

               Thē seing the sonne goeth not out of ther sight for the space of. 182. dais, & xij. hours, whiche is there continuall daye: then it should go aboute the horizont but in that lōg place.
            
            
               Phi.
               That is false. For how think you, doth not the sonne circuit th' earth in xxiiij. houres continuallye?

               Yes verely.

               Thē doth the shadow go about their Horizōt in the same space of time, except you imagin those Periscios, to dwel without the circuit of th' earth.

               That were a poynt of demency or madnes: so that as oftē as he circuith th' earth, so oftē in lik case do ther shadow turne about the place of their horizont, which must neades be 182 times.

                  Ther may many cōclusions by this table be wrought as you shal know or we depart: but now let vs furder proced cōcerninge our talke of zones, in which you must cōsider that these zones of which we haue intreated, ar deuided into climates, & regions.
            
            
               Spo.
               How doth à climatand à zone differ, they both wer for this cause first inuented, to make diuision of the face of th' earth into sōdry parts.
            
            
               Philo.
               I confesse no lesse, but they differ in this poynt,How a Zone & a Climate differ. that à Zone doth in it cōtain the fift portiō of th' earth, and à climate but only so much of th' earth, & the lōgest day in that place, do differ from th' equinoctial. xxx. minutes, or half an hour, and are named. vii. in numbre, of all th' auncient Geographers.
            
            
               Spoud.
               Then the first climate shalbe in latitude. xvi. degrees. xliiij. minutes from th' equinoctiall, and the lō
                  gest day, shall excede. xij. houres (whiche is the quantitie of the daye vnder th' equinoctiall) one houre: for so saithe Ptolomaeus.
            
            
               Philon.
               It is true, but heare you muste consider, thatPtolomaeus de uision of Climates. Ptolomaeus deuideth euery climate in. iiij. equall portions, & nameth them Paralleles: euery one of them cō
                  teining in latitude. iiij. degrees, xviij. min. incresing the quantity of the longest day. xv. minutes: so that Ptolomaeus (making the first climate xvi. degrees, xliiij. min. in Latitude from th' equinoctiall) meaneth the middes, and not the beginning of the climate.
            
            
               Spou.
               I praye you or we anye further proceade shewe me the signification of a Parallele.
            
            
               Philo.
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   in Greke (whicheWhat a Parallele is. we also do call à Parallele) is à Circle equally distaunt,

from that which is drawne next him, and are described by the course of the sonne and starres, of which the greatest is th' equinoctial: for that he is furdest frō the Poles, so that the nerer the poles, the lesse is the parallele: and the number of them Ptolomaeus maketh. xxj. as in this figure, in which I haue made. xxj. paralleles frō th' equinoctiall,

vnto both the poles Arctike & Antarctike, and now to our matter againe from whence we did digresse. You shall consider that euerye Climate hathe à proper name, for the suerer difference of one from an other:

& taketh his name of some notable Citye, Mountaine, or Riuer, ouer which the mids of that Climate is drawn As for example.
               
                  
                     The middes of the firste Climate goeth ouer a notable Ilande of Nilus, called Meroë & of that we name it Dia Meroes, that is, the climat going ouer Meroë.
                     The seconde Climat is called Dia Syënes of a citye in Egipt called Syënes.
                     The middes of the thirde climate is drawen ouer Alexandria, an other Citye also in Egipt & therfore called Dialexandrias.
                     The fourth goth ouer th' Iland of the Rodes, now in subiection to the great Turke, and is named Diarhodou.
                     The fift climate Dia Romes going ouer Rome somtime the head of the world, at this preset the sinck of sin.
                     The sixte Climate is named Dia Pontou, because it goeth ouer the Pontike seas named Euxinus.
                     The seuenth is drawē by Boristhenes a Citye so called & therefore named Diaboristheneos, & not by the Ri

                        hean Mountanes as the vnlerned sort suppose: seing that they ar at the lest. x. deg. frō this climate distaunte.
                  
               
            
            
               Spou.
               And what was the cause that they described no places, beyōd the. 7. climate: seing that ther are many inhabitāts, (as by your words do appeare) wher you made mention of the habitable places in th' earth?
            
            
               Philo.
               It was, ether because they supposed those places scāt, or with muche paines habitable for th' extreme cold: or els, that they knew not the parts North frō thē situated, as now we do,
            
            
               Spou.
               And do they not make

mention of Climates drawne South from th'equinoctiall as of the North, of whiche you haue spoken?
            
            
               Phi.
               They do in like maner deuide that portion, into vij. Climates: but for that they knewe no notable places,South Climates. (as in the north partes from th'equinoctiall) they gaue them the names of the North Climates, with this addition Anti (that is to saye oppositie or againste) as Antidiameroes, the Climate Southe from th'equinoctiall, opposite or agaynst the north Climat, drawn by Meroë. And so in like sort with th'other, as this figure shewith, in

               Spou.
               Now I pray you declare the cōtinuation of the Climates, & paralleles.
            
            
               Philo.
               I wil fulfill your request. The partes of th'Earth Northwardes beinge by painfull, & dāgerous nauigatiōs found out, are deuided also into Climates, we folowing the same ordre that Pto lomaeus, and th'aunciente Geographers vsed: tbat is, euery parallele to be distaunt from an other. 4. degrees, 18. minutes: and euery climate one from an other 7. degreesThe quantitie of climates & Paralleles. 27. minutes: geuing them in like sort apte names of the places ouer which they are drawne: so that in our time, there is founde after the same inuention 96. Paralleles, of which are made 24. climates, and for that it shall not easely be breuied in the poke of Obliuiō, behold I haue drawne out a Table, conteining in it the paralleles & Climates with the places ouer whicb they directli are described: as also th'eleuation of the pole Arctike, vnto 90. degrees: and the quantity of the longest daye, answeringe vnto euery one of those degrees, whiche Table shall muche pleasure you, as hereafter it shall be euident.

               Then seyng there is no mutation of qualitie of th' Aëre, it is thought temperat. And for that this place is iudged most temperate, there be some that suppose Can Eden, that is to say, Paradise, to be situated vnder th' Equinoctiall,Pardaise where. as à place of pleasure, voluptiousnes, voide of Alteration, & cōtrary qualities: Yea, & Lira, interpretingLira.

And Polybius with Eratosthenes (as Strabo witnesse) doth affirme the temperatest dwelling to be vnder th' equinoctiall.

               I will not much of that thing speke, but if Hell be in that place whiche is furdest from the heauen, as paine & grief is furdest from pleasure, and ioye: then it must nedes be in the center of th' Earih, whiche is to saye that part that is in the mids of the same, for that is of all other parts furdest from the heauen. Whych is the cause that not onlye we, but also the Poëts in their tragedies, introduce persons comming out from vnder th' earth & call that place Hell, amonge other, Senica introduceth

Thyëstes, coming out of hell, in this maner speking.

               I will gladly, keping not backe such waies as I also haue deuised to finde out th' aforsaid line. And first I wil begin with th' inuentionTo finde out the Meridian Line after Glarians maner. of Glarian to find this none stede line, whiche is in thys manner. In any leuell and plaine place, with your compasse make à circle: in what quātitye you please, in the center of whiche, you shall place a right Wyer, directlye standing vp, that it may geue a shadowe on the circle aforesaid. Then mark the shadow which the sonne in hys rising & going down in thy Horizōt giueth, as for exā
                  ple. A. Is the Wier reared right vp in the center of the Circle: C. the East, & B. the West. The longest shadow that the Sonne maketh aboue the Horizont is A.D: Thē he ascending hier, makes his shadow shorter. A.E. the None steade or Meridian shadow, whiche is shortest

                  
is A. F. and th'other shadowes G. A: H. A. are in the like sort the shadows which the sōne casteth into the East, after he is past the meridian circle, descending into the West.

               Philo.
               No verely, for whan the shadow doth no lenger decrese, you drawing from the center to the circumference a straight line, shal haue your own desire. Other willing to exchew the tediousnes of time in obseruation,The seconde way. do prouide a Plate of Meatall, well pullished, or some thick planke smothe, and plained, in whiche is drawne à circle as in th'other aforsaid, with a Wyer or like thynge set vp right in the center, and do diligently before none obserue whan the shadow of the Wier in length is equall with the circumference: and at th'end of it make à prick. In like sorte after noone whan as the shadowe commeth vnto the circumference, and make there also à prick, thē
                  
with the compasse, deuide the space betwixte these two prickes in the middes, and make there à note or pricke: after draw à right line from the center, to that middle pricke, and it shall alwaye shewe the whan as the sonne is in the meridian or middaye line, for that eleuation of the Pole as in this example.

In like maner the same yere, the. 6. day of Septembre the sonne had his course in the. 24. degre of the virgine, and because I finde Virgo in the lower parte of the Table, ascendinge in the last colunme vpward, find the 24. degre, and against it in the columne of Uirgo. 40. degrees 25. minutes, the Meridian altitude of the sōne, answering that degree: in like sort, do with any degre of th'other

               Whan as the sonne is in either AequinoctiallTo finde oute th'eleuation of the Pole aboue the Horizont. poyntes, by the helpe of your none steade shadowe, you shal find when he is in the meridian line: then with your instrument take his altitude, whiche you shall subtracte from. 90. degrees, and the remanent shallbe the iust eleuation of the Pole, as for example.
               
                  At Norwich. 1557, the 10. of march, I found the meridianeAn obseruation. altitude of the sōne by my Astrolabe 37. degrees and 50. minutes, which I did subtract from 90. degrees, and there remained 52. degrees 10. minuts, the true height of the Pole, and latitude of Norwich.

               And do you not marke his declination at that time?
            
            
               Phi.
               I cannot marke that, whiche is not. For inFol. 31. & 32. these poynts he hath no declination, and that you might se in the table seruing that vse which is in the first boke. But although this way is very perfect yet carieth it this discommoditie with him: that you can but twise yearely, take th'eleuatiō of the Pole. And therfore I will showe you also how to find it whan he is in the Tropick poynts.
            
            
               Spoud.
               That is in the beginning of Cancer and Capricorn.
            
            
               Phi.
               It is so, you shall finde oute (as afore) wyth your instrument the sonnes height at middaye, whan as he is in the first degree of Cancer.
            
            
               Spou.
               That time can I finde oute by the helpe of an Ephemerides.
            
            
               Phi.
               From this height, you shall take away, as your table sheweth 23. degrees 28. minuts: this numbre you shall subtract frō 90. degrees, & the remanant shalbe th'exacte Eleuation of your pole, as for example. I find the height of the sōne at midday in the beginning of Cancer. 61. degrees. 18. minutes, from which I take 23. degrees 28. minutes, and there shall remayne 37. degrees 50. minutes, this nomber I take from. 90. degrees (being an hole quadrant) there remaineth 52. degrees 10. minutes, th'eleuation of the pole.
            
            
               Spoud.
               I will proue by your licence, and I can do in

like case whan as he is in Capricorn.
            
            
               Phil.
               Do you so.
            
            
               Spou.
               I imagine his none steade heighte to be. 14. degrees. 22. minutes, for because he is farre from our Zenit: from which I cannot substract the greatest declination of the sonne, answering the first degre of Capricorn, in the table of declination.
            
            
               Phi.
               Nor you shall not make anye subtraction. For like as whan he declineth North, from th'equinoctiall (which is from the beginningThe Sonnes de clinatiō north. of Aries vnto th'end of Virgo) you shall subtracte his declinatiō from his altitude: so in like maner, hauingThe Sonnes de clinatiō south. his declination South (which is from the beginninge of Lybra vnto th'end of Pisces) you muste adde his declination to the meridian altitude: and subtract thē bothe from. 90. degrees.
            
            
               Spo.
               Then I wil end my example. I do adde. 23. degrees. 28. min. vnto 14. degrees 22. min. (the nonestede height) which make 37. degrees. 50. mi. & I take this frō. 90. degrees, as you commaunded, and ther remaineth 52. degrees. 10. minutes as afore.

               But is it not possible to finde th'eleuatiō of the Pole euery day? for in traueling it shuld pleasure me.
            
            
               Phil.
               It is possible to find it not only euery day, but al so euery hour: but I will reserue that vntill an other season, and will shew you how to find the height of the Pole euery day, for whiche thinge I will geue you two sondrye wais: th'one without any other instrumente more then a staffe, or other thing erected to geue à shadow (whyche I haue inuented) th'other way is by the helpe of an instrument,The third way with which I will begin. Take the sonnes heighte

as before beinge in the Meridian line, then take oute of some Ephemerides his place in the Zodiake, in degrees, & minutes, with which you shall enter into the table of declination, & ther find his declination from th'Equinoctiall, answering to the said degrees, & minutes. And if it be North, thē subtracte it from th'Altitude Meridiā: or if it be South, adde it to the said Altitude: then addyng, or subtracting that numbre from 90. Digrees, there shall remayne the trewe Eleuation of the Pole.

               Wyll it please you to let me proue this rule by an example?

               right willingly. You shall proueide a staffe, or any rightwand, in what length you please, this you shall deuide into. 60. equall portions. Then take oute of some Ephemerides, or Almanach, the day whan as the Sōne entreth into the first digree of Aries, Cancer, Libra, & Capricornus. At which times set your staffe vpright in some place: And marke the shadow how longe it doth decrease, & whā it is at the shortest, the sōne is in the noonstead place. Then at that instaunt take the length of the shadow, & enter into the Table of shadowes: & there thou shalt finde th'exacte Latitude of thy Citie. As for thy better instruction: I find in an Ephemerides the sōne to be in the firste Digree of Aries, 1558. the 12. daye of March. Therfore whan as the sonne approche towarde the south, I set my staffe directly vp, & find the shadow at midday 77. parts, 13. minutes, with which I enter the Table of shadowes (vnder this title, Aequinoctiall shadow) & can not finde my number expressed, therfore I finde next vnder my nūber seuentie sixe, 48. vnto which 52. digrees in Latitude do answere, wherfore I workinge by proportion, finde correspondent vnto 77. parts, 13. minutes: 52. digrees, 10. minutes.

               It differeth in no point frō the former

order, sauinge that in the table of shadowes, you muste only haue respect to the columne of the sonnes altitude, & the shadow answering hereto. Then to finde the degre he is in at that present: next in the table of declination to seke out the declination of the same degree, & if it be North, subtract it from the altitude, so the remanent from. 90. degrees, & you shall haue your owne desire.

               The Mariners vse to find out the latitude of the place by findinge the height of the Northe starre, which they call the lode starre, esteming à degre, or two, in obseruation as no error. But you shall worcke in thys maner: first find out any notable starre (that you knowe perfaitly) in the table of fixed starres, & with Ptolomaeus rule, or other instrumente, obserue his heighte in the meridian line: then in the table of declination, you shall find how much he declineth North or South, from th'equinoctiall, & obseruing th'order, as you do with the searching out of the Pole by the sonnes altitude Meridiane, and declination: you shall haue your hole desire.

               It is not so easie, & facile à thing, to trie th'eleuation of the Pole: but it is as harde, & laborus, to get the Longitude, which was the cause that the Auncient Geographers had onely one way, & that is by obseruing of th'Eclipses of the Mone.

And nowe I wyll giue you à twofould example. Anno. Christi. 1558.An obseruation of an Eclipse. the second day of Aprill, there was à great Eclipse of the Mone, so that she was darkened x. pointes well nere, & began to come vnder the shadowe of th' Earth at Norwich,

at x. a clock 37. minutes at night (as by taking the height of à fixed sterre, called the virgins spike, did euidently appeare) now willing to note mens obseruations in other places, I finde that Leouitius Cyprianus, in hys boke of Eclipses, apoynteth it to begin at Augusta in Ger many 23. min. after xi. a clock at night. Then to find the longitude of Augusta frō Norwich I subtract. x. houres 37. min. frō xi, houres 23 min, ther remaine 49, minuts,

               I will geue you an exāple of that time, which I obserued my self to find out the lōgitude of Norwich.
               Anno. 1558. the second day of February, at. x. a clockeAn example, at night, I found the place of regulus (called also the lions hart) in longitude degrees. 23. 32. minut. in Leo: the Mone also at that present, in the .xxi. degree .xl. min. of the same signe (hir place being calculated for Anwarp, which is xxvi. degrees. xxxvj. minutes) I subtracte the place of the mone, from the longitude of regulus, the distance .j. degre .lij. min. that she is West, from the sterre. Then I take my staffe & (with one eie closed) I moue the crosse vp & down, vntill th'one end was equall with the Center of the Mone, th'other ende with the Starre. Then I find by that obseruation, the Mone to differ frō regulus, j. degree. 43. min. This numbre I take from the first difference, ther remaineth 9. minutes.

into degrees of th'equinoctiall, make. 4. degrees: & because the Mone is West of the sterre, & the distance found by the staffe lesse in number, therefore I subtracte the. 4. degrees from the longitude of Anwarpe, & there remaine. 22. degrees. 36. minutes, which differ littel frō the other obseruations.

After draw right lines from the prickes in the hier part of the Table, vnto the Prickes in the lower part. And write in them the degrees of Longitude, as. 10. 11. 12. or. 20. 21. 22. & then is thy carde made ready to serue thy necessary vse.

               Only to seeke oute of Ptolomaeus Geographie, or my fifth booke, the latitudes of Cities, Townes, Villages, Hilles, Riuers, or other notable thinges in that Region conteined, & accordinge to those nōbres, to place thē in your card, or mappe.

               I do not so muche fansye Ptolomaeus, in lōgitudes & latitudes, for he was not able being so mighty à Prince to trauell into those countris, that to à priuate person (for the greate distaunce à sunder) was impossible. And therfore receiuinge (as he confesseth) obseruations at other mens handes, dyd in many sundry places swarue from the trueth.
            
            
               Ph.
               And that was not to be imputed vnto PtolomaeusPtolomaeus ex cused. as à crime, seyng the errour ensued by other mens obseruations. But for this cause I haue made my fifthe Booke, in the whiche, I haue folowed Ptolomaeus in

certaine pointes touchinge his natiue Countrey, & places to them adiacent. In th'other, I haue vsed later writers trauelles, not omitting my owne as you shall euidētly perceaue.

               Here minding to describe the plat forme ofAn example. Englande, I draw (as you se) à right line in the middes of the Mappe. And because I finde in my fift boke, that it is frō the Weast part of the same to th'East. 11. digres: I diuide this streght line (beynge the Meridian Line, for the middes of this Regiō) into xj. equall partes, or portions: Then do I searche how much the Pole Arctik is eleuated aboue th'Aequinoctiall, in the furdest north part of Englande: & finde it 61. (for vnder the name of Englande, I comprehend the whole Ilande cōteyning also Schotlande, & Irelande.) Therfore I enter into the Table goyng before, & finde answering to 61. digr. 29. minutes, 5. secondes, 19. thirdes. Which space, I take with my cōpasse in one of the diuisiōs of Lōgitude, that I made in the meridian line, & so my compasse not opened wider, I begin at the Meridian Line in the higher part of the Card, & make on either side 5. pricks (that is to sai) v. on the left hād, & v. on the right hād. in like ma ner I find the south part to differ frō th'equinoctial lj. di. wherfore entring into the Table, I find answering to lj. dig: 37. min. 45. seco. 33. thir. And with my cōpasse I take the like portion in one of the diuisions of the Meridian line, & then with my compasse I diuide the lower parte

of the Table, as I did the hier. Then draw I right Lines from the Prickes in the hier part of the Table, vnto the prickes in the lower part: & wright at th'endes of them, the Digrees of Lōgitude, as also in the diuisiōs of the Meridiam line, I wright the digrees of latitude. Thē seke I in the fifth boke for the notable Cities, Townes, Villages, & suche like, & place them in this card, according to their true Longitude, & Latitude, as in the card of Englād following you may well perceiue.

               Nowe I perceiue by the makinge and describyng of this onely Mappe, that the whole worke doeth chieflye depende vppon the Meridian Line, appointing by them the longitudes of Regiōs: & by Paralleles of Climates, whose vse in à Carde, is to limite the Latitude frō th'Equinoctiall. So that obseruing this order of you prescribed, I may in like sorte at my pleasure, drawe à Carde for Spaine, Fraunce, Germany, Italye, Graece, or any perticuler regiō: yea, in à warme & pleasaunt house, without any perill of the raging Seas: danger of enemies: losse of time: spending of substaunce: werines of body, or anguishe of minde. Oh how precious â Iewell is this, it may rightly be called à CosmographicallCosmographicall Glasse. Glasse, in which we may beholde the diuersitie of countries: natures of people, & innumerable formes of Beastes, Foules, Fishes, Trees, Frutes, Stremes, & Meatalles.

               You shall haue iust ccasiō to affirme, whan as you vnderstande the whole cōmoditie of the same. But I will shewe you to describe iij. or iiij. Regiōs in one Mappe: yea, or so manye as are cōteined in

                  
th'eyght portion of th'Earth. And therefore I call it à Carde, conteining th'eyght part of th'Earth, whose compasse,

in what quātitie you please (the greater the better) & note, it with A. B. C for the easier vnderstanding, vn till you are exercised herein. Then deuide the compasse of this Circle in iij equale partes, & marke the pointes of the diuision, with A. B. C. After place th'one ende of the cōpasse in A. & stretche out th'other ende vnto B. or C. & with thy compasse draw an arcke, or portion of à Circle, from B. to C. Then set th'one ende of the compasse in B. & draw the like arcke frō A. vnto C. After place the one ende of thy cōpasse in C: & describe the like arck frō B. to A. And here note that A. doth signifie the North, or south Pole. And th'arke B. C. the quadrant, or iiij. part of th'Equinoctial Circle. This arke B. C. you shall di uide equallye in the middes, & at that pointe place D. Then draw à right line from A. vnto D. this shall repraesent the meridiane line for the middes of this carde. This line shall you diuide into 90. partes, & euery one shall repraesent à digree: or into 18. portions, & euery one shall answere vnto v. digr. Or (if the Mappe be small) into 9. portions, & euery suche diuision shall signifie. 10. digrees. Then placing th'one ende of your compasse in A. extende, or stretch out th'other vnto euery of these diuisions, & drawe arkes, or portions of circles, from th'arck A. B. vnto th'arck A. C. These ended, you shall write in euery diuision from B. to C. th'equinoctiall, vnto A. the Pole Arctik 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. or 5. 10. 15. 20: or 10. 20. 30. according to the diuision of the meridiane line. After you shall accompt in this diuision 23. digrees. 28. minutes from the quinoctiall, which is the sonnes greatest declination, and

draw ther à double arke whiche shall serue for the Tropicke of Cancer, or Capricorne, noted with E L, & in like manner accompt. 23. degrees. 28. minutes from the North or South pole, & in that space draw in like sort à double arke, which shalbe in stead of the polary circle, either Arctike or Antarctike, & set th'endes of it. I K. and so are all the paralleles of latitude, (answering your mappe) perfaitly finished.

               I vnderstand the protracture of them very wel. But shall there be but one Meridiane line for all thys Mappe?
            
            
               Phil.
               Yes verely, ther shalbe so many, as there are paralleles of latitude, whose nombre as I saide was. 90.
            
            
               Spou.
               Now I perceiue the reasō of this artificial working, for like as the circuite of the heauens is distributed into. 360. parts: so in like maner the compasse of th'earth is also into 360 portions deuided, both toward the Poles & also from West to East. Therfore I pray you shew me the waye howè to draw these meridiane lines.
            
            
               Philo.
               You shal deuide the arke B D Cinto. 90. or. 18. or els 9. portions equally, as I did the latitude from A vnto D. In like sort you shall deuide the polary Circle. I K. then drawinge in these diuisions from th'equinoctiall (by the diuisions of the Polary Circle) vnto A, Arkes or portions of Circles, you shal haue the frame preparid in whiche you shall (in the same maner that you did for England) place such portion of the world, as it can aptly receiue.

               But may I not describe here the paralleles, & climates (taking thē out of the table in the second boke) as Ptolomaeus doth in his Geographie?
            
            
               Phi.
               Yes verely, & it shall adorne the mappe, not omitting the principall windes seruing for that part of th'earth, nor yet th'inhabitāts called for the diuersitie of shadows, Periscij, Heteroscij, Amphiscij, but nowe beholde the frame of whose composition we haue made so manye wordes.

               This mappe doth liuely expresse your meaning so that ther is none (I suppose) so ignorāt or dul, but that

without great difficultie he may practise the like, & ther fore I require you procede in the descriptiō of à Card, for halfe the face of th'Earth whiche (as I coniecture) wyll conueniently serue for our Hemisphere.

               Not for our Hemispere onely, but also for any one halfe portion of th'earth, as well seruing th'vse of thē that dwell vnder vs directly (& called therfore Antipodes) as also any other. But I will leaue to speake of th'vse of it, because of it self it is manifest, & wil make plain vn to you the cōposition, & artificial praeparatiō of it. First with your cōpase describe à Circle as great as your carde shalbe, withī which draw an other Circle, à finger bredth distant, & iust to this, also an other. Then part these Cir cles in the middes with à right lyne, th'endes of which ar A. C. crosse this lyne in the middes, with an other ryghte line B. D. So is your Circle parted into 4. equal portions Then deuide euery portion in the cōpasse of the circle into 90. partes in this maner. First into 3. then euery of thē againe into 3. after into 2. & laste into 5. After write in them 5. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. &c frō B.

               Philo.
               The line A. C. repraesenteth the meridiane: as the line B. D. The halfe Aequinoctiall circle. Also A. C. repraesenteth the Poles of the world, & the plages, or partes of the same, north & south: as B. signifieth the weast, & D. th'East.

& note th'intersections of the ruler in th'Aequinoctiall & in like maner do in th'other halfe Circle A. D. C. this ended, you shall describe from A. vnto C. Paralleles, or halfe circles, by these diuisions in th'Equinoctiall: then write on them from B. to D. 10▪ 20. 30. 40. &c. Also you shall apply the ruler to the circle, diuiding the Meridiane line A. C. as you did th'equinoctial B. D. & describe in th'interfectiōs in like maner, halfe circles, which shall serue for Paralleles of Latitude. Then accompte in the

                  
circle from B. toward A. xxiij. digr. 28. min. & describe an arcke, which shall repraesent the halfe tropick of Cancer, also frō A. toward B. accōpte xxiij. digr. 28. min. & draw with your compasse another arcke, which shall signifie the halfe Articke, or polary circle: in like maner do with the tropike of Capricorne, & th'Antarticke circle. After place the halfe part of th'earth in the mappe thus praepared, & describe the Climates, Paralleles, inhabitaūts, & winds, with theyr proper names, & the mappe shalbe perfaitlye finished, as for example, you maye beholde the frame of the Hemisphere of th'Earth, before placed.

               First describe on some plaine place, an halfe circle A. B. C. vpō the center D. so great as thou wilte haue the carde, after deuide the right lyne A. D. into 90, portions equally. Then place th'one ende of your compasse in A. stretching forth th'other ende vn to 86. degr. xv. min. & xx, secondes, in the line A. D. & so with your Compasse, draw an arke frō D. vnto the halfe circle A. B. C. whiche shall crosse it in B, (for by

                  
this way th'arke A. B. being extended right forth, shalbe as long as the right line A. D.) Then you shal diuide this arke A. B. into 90. equal partes. After with your compasse take the quātitie of th'arke A. B. and placing th'one ende in B. take the lyke quātitie in the half circle towardes C. whiche in like maner you shal diuide into 90. portiōs, & so th'arke A. B E shalbe parted into 180. parts. Again with thy compasse take the lengthe of the line A. D. & th'one ende beynge placed in A. take the lyke proportion from A. to F. so that A. F. shalbe equall to the line A. D. Then diuide the line A. F. into 90. partes equally, as you did A. D. after placing th'one

fote of thy cōpasse in the Cēter D. thou shalt draw arkes in euery of the diuisiōs, or els euery fift, or x. diuision onlye & note the hiest Arke nexte with G. H. then enter into the table folowing, & find out how many degrees in lōgitude answereth to. 80. degrees of latitude, north frō th'equinoctiall (which in the table are. 140. degrees. 40 minutes) that number you shal accompt in the half circle from A, vnto E. & applying your ruler vnto th'end of this nōber, & vnto the cēter D. drawà short line, whiche shal extēd vnto H. again enter into your table with 70. degrees of Latitude, & you shall finde. 138. degrees 23. minutes (which I accompt from A, toward E as before, & applying my ruler to the shorte line, & the degrees in Longitude, with my pen I draw an other shorte line. In like maner I do with th'other paralleles of Latitude. 60. 50. 40. 30. 20. 10.

But like as this waie is more easier then that whiche is performed by longitude, & Latitude, & may be put in practice at all times: so in like condition, the worcke is not so exacte, and perfaite, as by Longitudes and Latitudes, whiche require longe and diligent obseruation.

But it differeth from an Astrolabe, in that it hath à Diall, with à Nedle fixed in it, & also that th'Instrument is diuided into two & thirtie partes, like as à Shipmans compasse. As this figure before placed, doth apparantly set out.

               I will in fewe wordes make it to you euident. With youre Instrumente you shall ascende on some hie towre, Steaple, or Mountayne, so that you may on euery part se the townes, & Uillagies, aboute you adiacent in your Horizont. Then placing your Instrument (which I name à Geographicall plaine Sphere) Flat, & leuell,The Geographicall plaine Sphere. tourninge it from one parte vnto an other, vntil the nedle fall on the Meridian Line, in thy Geographicall plaine Spheare, then it remaininge stedfaste: directe the ruler with hys two sightes vnto anye one place that you do see, & marke diligently th' Angle of sight, (GemmaTh' Angle of sight.

               I am nothynge displeased, but muche reioyse that you will not negligentlye suffer

thinges to escape you, vntill you be satisfied touchinge their true meaninge. You shall note that the Angle of sighte, is that Arke or portion of the Horizont of anyeTh' Angle of sight. place, comprehended betwixte two Meridiane Circles and drawne by the verticall Circle of the first place, vnto the Meridian of the secōde, whose distaunce you seke out.

               I do so, for if it be. 90. degrees, the place is vnder the same Parallele of Latitude, but yet differeth in Longitude, & therefore is directly East or West, as also if there be no Angle of sighte, it hathe the same Longitude & meridiane Line, & is plaine North or South from you.

               Yea verelye, and then you shall make in some Paper à greate Circle, & deuide it into. 360 partes, as your Geographicall plaine Sphere is, writinge the foure coastes of the countrey East, South, West, & North, in your paper, then draw right lines frō the Center of your circle, (whiche representeth your place where you take th' Angles of sight of other townes, & villagies adiacēt) vnto suche Angles of sighte as you haue founde oute by your Geographicall plain Sphere.

               I cōfesse no lesse: for if you haue not th' Angles of sighte from ij. places, you can not gather the distaunce of the thirde. Therfore when as you haue placed in the Paper all the Townes, Uillages, or notable hils, that you can se in that Horizont: you shall take your instrument and Paper, trauelinge vnto some other town, where in like manner you shall go vp into the hiest place of the same, and there placinge your instrumente as before, obserue th' Angles of sight of such Townes & Villagies as are in that Horizont. Whiche ended, you shall describe in the Paper an other circle as before (as farre distaunte frō th'other, as you thinke conueniente, marking diligentlye that the Center of the second Circle, be in the line of sighte, drawne from the Center of the firste Circle, it beinge also deuided into. 360. partes) drawing such Angles of sight as you can finde. And so procede frō place to place, vntil euery Towne or Uillage haue come twise in your sight. And where that anye line of the seconde Circle, Crosseth the like line in the firste Circle, make there a Sterre, or like marke, for that thirde place (so call I the towne obserued twise) & so in like manner you shall do with other places, vntil you haue drawn the hole region you desire.

               Than it is expediente for me to obserue the Angle of sighte of euerye Towne, from ij. seueral places, so shall I finde oute the distaunce of one of them from an

               Your wordes giueth me occation to demaunde the cause of ebbing, & flowing, & also whether the time may by any meane be learned?

               And I will gladly answere you, for this is not the least thing that Pilotes, & Shipmen ought to haue regarde vnto, bothe for goyng out, & also comminge in into any Porte, or Hauen, & other necessarye matters. & as touchinge the Seas howe that they raise, and Eleuate vp them selues, as though they would touch the firmament, and there with filleth other Armes, Hauens,The cause of spring & ebbe tides. and waters: and also, that they waxe shallowe, and as it were emptye againe: I can coniecture no other cause then that, which the Noble Philosopher & Phisitian Gale nus citith, in his boke De diebus decretorijs: in which he affirmeth that whē as the Mone increse in light, al moist thinges in like case increase: & when as her light decrea seth, they in like sort decrease. Wherby it is euident that spring, & ebbe tides, take their beginning & end of the mones course in the Zodiack. Galenus words are these.

                  All thinges which are vnder the power of the Moone, when as she resembleth the sith in likenes, they are feble, & decrease: but al thinges waxe & increase, when she is at the Full.

               Then by these wordes I gather à repugnancieAn obiection. betwixt his authoritie, & dayly experience: for it is more manifest, & clere thē midday, how that the seas ebbe, & flow euery natural day, that is in 24. houres

twise: & Galenus saith, how but twise in à Month the Seas ebbe & flow: for because she is but once at the full, & once at the chaunge in this circuit of time.

               This obiection nothing infringeth Galen his authoritie,Th'answere. nor yet experience. For in the spring, and ebbe tides, the seas do encrease, & decrese meruelously: whiche happen but twise euery mōth, & this is that, which Galenment. And as for daily ebbing, & flowinge, the seas do not increase, or decrease therwith. And therfore is properlye called fluxus, etrefluxus, but th'other Augmentum et Decrementum maris.

               And what is the cause of this dailye ebbinge and flowinge so orderlye, as often & sundrye times I haue well noted?
            
            
               Phi.
               The mone also, for when as she riseth in th'East,The cause of Ebbyng and flowing. the seas begin to increase more & more, vntill she commeth to the Meridian Circle, & is full Southe: & then causeth full Sea. And so as she declineth from the South, so the sea decrease, vntill she go downe in the Weast Ocean, at whiche time againe the Seas begin to increase, vntill the Moone be in the foresaide Meridian Line, vnder th'earth, & then she is full North, making also full seas. So they decrease by little & little as the Mone aprocheth toward th'East.

               Then I praye you teache me some briefe waye how I maye at all times finde th'age of the Mone withoute anye tables of her diurnall course, or Ephemerides: for hauing that, I shall easlye finde oute the springe and ebbetides.

               With à right good will, you shall accompt the daies, that are past of thy month, & adde thereto the Epacte,How at all tymes to finde th'age of the Moone. And to this number you shall also adde for euerye month past (beginning at Marche) 1. These 3, numbers you shall adde together, and that shall shew you the age of the Mone. As for example 1559, the 24. daye ofAn example. August, I wolde knowe the mones age. Firste I adde 24 daies to th'Epact which is 22, the number of them is 46, then from March to August, ther are 5. Monthes past, therfore I adde to 46. the number of 5. and the hole number is fiftie one, from whiche I take thirtie, (for so must you do, if your number be more then xxx. & vnder sixtie) & there remaine, one & twentie, which is th'age of the Mone.

               And what if the number be 30. or 60. what must I then do?
            
            
               Philonicus.
               There is no thing to do, for that number sheweth the Moone to chaunge that presente daye.

               That is so easie, as I counte it but lost time to make many wordes there in.

And it shall shewe you what time the sonne setteth: after, seke out th'age of the Mone by th'Epacte, or otherwise, & against that number in this table (intituled the time that the mone shineth. &c.) You shal find houres, & minutes, which adde to the going down of the sonne, & that nomber shall manifestly declare how long she is aboue th'Earthe, as for example. The. xx. daye ofAn example. Marche. 1559. the Mone is xj. daies olde: against which number in the Table of hyr shining, I finde viij. houres, 48. minutes. Thē do I loke at what tyme the sonne setteth the. xx. day of March, & find it at vi. of the clocke xviij. minutes. These I adde together, and the numbre is xv. hours vi. minutes: so that the mone sheweth vnto iii. of the clocke in the morning, & vi. minutes after. & heare you muste note, that before the Full, & after the chaunge, she shineth presently, the sonne beinge set. But after the Full mone, you shall subtract oute of the sonnes rising, so many hours & minuts, as you finde in th'age of the mone: & the remanent, shal shew when as she do rise as for example. The xxvij. day of March, the moone isAn example. xviij. daies old, the time of hir shining, is x. houres xxiiij minutes: the sonne riseth that day, at v. of the clock. xxx minutes. Now subtract the shining of the Mone, out of the sonnes rising: there remaine vii. houres vi. minuts, the time whan as the Mone shall shew her selfe aboue the Horizont.

               I will shewe you, they called th' East: Subsolanus, for that the sunnè riseth there being in th' equinoctiall poyntes. The Weast wind also they called Fauonius, of norishinge: the winde whiche commeth out of the North, Septentrio: the South winde Auster. Then the

wind that bloweth betwixt th' east, & the South, named South East. Also that which cōmeth out of that place betwixt th' east & the north, they called it northeast. The space directly betwixt the north, & the west, they named northwest: as betwixt the south, & the west southwest, as in this, figure A. B. C.

               Yet ther is another kind of partinge the Horizōt, thē you haue declared: for I remember that I red in Marcus Manilius, how the Horizō: wasMarcus Manilius. parted in 12. partes: but the reason of it I could neuer vnderstande.

               Manilius doeth very aptly shew th' order of parting the Horizōt in to 12. partes. For (saith he) ther com meth two windes frō those partes of the Horizont, where th' equinoctial crosseth it equally, of which, th' East he calleth Eurus: And the Weast Zephyrus, or Fauonius. Thē the meridiā circle crosseth also the Horizōt equally

in the middes. And so by these intersectiōs ther are two other windes described: the North, he calleth Boreas, The Southe Auster.

               Philo.
               Yea, but in the rest it differeth bothe from thē, & also the seconde sort. For these parted the Horizont in. 8. equall portiōs: but Manilius into. 12. inequal parts for he described. iiij. collaterall windes by the. ij. Tropick Circles, which are the places where the Sonne riseth & goeth downe in the middes of Somer, and Winter. And

                  
also other 4. winds at the Circles Arctick & Antarctick.

               I remēher that in our first daies talk, you shewed me what th'equinoctiall, the Tropickes, & the circles Arctik & Antarticke were: notwithstanding I shall the more spedely conceiue your meaning, if you vouch safe (as hetherto you haue vsed to geue me some example & picture hereof.

               That I will not refuse to do, or any other thinge, so that the more vtiliti hereof may vnto you insue. Wher fore behold the tipe before placed in which. A. B. C. D. E. F. G. H.

Also that part of the Arctick circles, which is most easterly marked with G, & th'other part furdest Weast, noted wyth I. also the part of the Circle Antartike furdest East, is markedThe Horizont parted into 32 partes. with M. And th'other portion furdest west with K. But nowe in oure time, the learned Hydrographers, & Trauelours on the Seas, haue yet gone beyonde them all, partyng the Horizont in 32. equall portions, as sufficiētly answering vnto euery viage throughe the hole Earth, & they haue geuen them very apte names, as in this Instrument folowyng more largely appeareth.

Also by this Compasse (the Sonne shynynge) you shall perfitly

know the houre of the day by the coast he is in. As when he is right Easte, & West, it is alwaye sixe of the cloke: also, à Southe Sonne maketh xij. of the clocke.

               This is very necessary also in trauilinge. And nowe retourne to that, from whence we did digresse.
               Ther are certein qualities applied to the windes, wherof doth that springe?
            
            
               Phi.
               There are so, & that cometh of the tēperatureNorth windes colde. of th'Earth, so that the North windes be called coulde, because they procede frō the frosen Zone, & these south windes hote, because that they come frō the burnt zone.South windes hote. But this belōgeth more to Physick, thē Nauigatiō. For we seke herin, to learne th'apt winde which shall cary vs, vnto the desired Porte, & not health, which is the Physitions chiefe care.
            
            
               Spou.
               I cōfesse no lesse, but yet sence we haue entred in to this matter, I wyll be so bold, as to trouble you herein further. And where as you say, the qualities of the windesAn obiection spring of the tēperature of th'earth, do you meane the zones, & Climates?
            
            
               Phil.
               I do no lesse:
            
            
               Spou.
               Thē seyng the North winde is called cold, because it cometh frō the north frosen zone, why by the like reason shall not the South windes be of like qualitie, cōming frō the south frosen zone?
            
            
               Philoni.
               I wyll aunswer you in few wordes. TheTh'Answere. North winde commeth from the North frosen zone,

and is felt in our Climate, because we are situated, nerer that, then the South frosen Zone: whiche beinge vnder our fete (as you haue heard before declared) is kepte frō vs, & the couldnes of the winde, not only mitigated, but also greatlye altered, throughe the heate of the burninge Zone. And therfore the South windes are called hotte.
            
            
               Spou.
               This doth very well agre both to reason, & experience. So that in th'Equinoctial, wher both the north, and South windes meete, there the windes are called tē
                  perate,Windes temperate vnder th'eqninoctiall because the couldnes of them is taken away by the heat of the burninge Zone. And by this also I gather, that suche as dwell in the temperate Southe Zone, (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   Proclus call it) beyond th'Equinoctiall, they call the South wind cold, and the North wind hot.
            
            
               Phi.
               It must neades so be, for that the burninge Zone qualifieth the coldnes os the Northe windes, throughe his heat, as to vs, he doth the South.
            
            
               Spou.
               There is now an other dout entred into my hed, of which to be deliuered I must (or we furder proced) require your ientill aid. And that is, whether in describingA question. the. iiij. Cardinall windes, you call the North Pole, the furdest North poynt or not: and th'Antarctick Pole the South poynte.

               It muste of force so be. But now seinge theis instructions seme sufficient vnto you, touchinge the order, number, diuision, and names of the windes: I will passe from that, and conuerte my talke, vnto the desired scope, (that is) howe to directe anye shippe, from place to place, from Port to Port, exactly by Art:
            
            
               Spou.
               And that is a thinge, whiche semeth merueilous. For it is thought praise worthye to go by lande, directlye without errour, from one place to an other, farre distant a sonder, hauing no path, or waye whereby to be guided. But in the wide Ocean, to finde à direct way, & to conducte his vessell vnto the port desired, is much more commendable. If Vlisses had knowne this Art, he shoulde not haue hene so long tossed on the troublous seas. If Diomedes,Vlisses. or Aeneas, had bene herein learned, they had not soDiomedes. Aneas. manye yeares bene driuen from place to place: knowinge not by what meanes, to attaine to their so longe desired Region.

directing of anye shippe, you maye do it two waies: th'one by the compasse onely, whiche was to th'olde Hydrographers,The compasse vnknowen to th'olde Hydre graphers. vnknowne: th'other by longitudes, Latitudes, and the compasse, of which her after we will shew the maner. As touchinge the firste waye, I will not laboure to write much of, because it is knowne well nie to euery Mariner. But yet I will shewe them certain obseruations, by whiche there is found manye errors in the nedle: that done I will also declare, how they shall correct the same, and sail more exactly then the most part are able?

But what be th'obseruations of this neadle, by whiche you affirme that it doth not exactlye poynte Northe, and Southe.

               They are of Iofrancus sette forthe, in thys wise.Obseruations of the nedle where it hath erred. In the Ilande called Insula Corui, it declined Easterlye. xv. degrees. Also in the place which shipmen call (Le Cap d'espoir en terre neuue) it declineth towarde the Weaste. 33. degrees, and. 45. minutes.

               If this be certain, then in dede th'error is not tollerable, but admit it be not so much, yet error in all thinges (as much as is possible) is to be eschewed, & veritie to be folowed. Wherfore I pray you, shew me how to find out à perfait nedle, & to correct it, if it be not perfect.

               Both the chosing of à nedle that is perfit, & also to correct the false, consisteth all in one precept. For if IHow to correcte the nedle can correct à false nedle, I can also chuse à true, & perfit: the way how you shall do that, is on this wise. whē you will verifie your nedle (if it be in the daye) you shall vse the healpe of the Sunne (and on the night) of some fixed sterre, marking diligently whā they are in the nonestead line: & then direct your nedle vnto the Sonne, or sterre, & if the flower of the nedle be righte Northe from it, your neadle is perfit: or if the flower be toward the sonne, & th'other part of it North, it is also true, & this your nedle corrected, you shall perfitly directe your ship, without errour.

               And this wil serue as wel on the seas, as on the lād. But on the lād you may draw à meridiane line, as I taught you, & set your cōpasse on the meridian Line, which you haue drawen, in suche maner, as the line North & South in the compasse, stand right in the same, & it is of all other th'exacte waye: & this hauinge youre line made, you maye at all times, verify any nedle, not tarying for the sonnes comming to the Meridian Circle.

               Vnto this way are required the circles of the Spheare, the meridian altitude of the sonne by daye, and sterre by nighte, the heighte of the Pole, the longitude of Regions and Portes, and the vse of the shipmans quadrat, whose inuentor was worthy D.

               Philon.
               I will shew you, opening the whole Art of directingHowe to direct a shippe to any Porte. your shippe. First you must seke out the longitude & Latitude both of the place from whence you saile, & also of that vnto which you intend to trauaile. Those you shall for the moste parte finde in my boke (whiche I will deliuer you at our departing) then subtracte the smaller number of Longitude and Latitude oute of the greater, and with the differēce of Lōgitude and Latitude, do in this maner. First if the Longitude of the place vnto whiche you trauell be greater then that from which you depart, entring into the hier part of the Quadrate (and towarde the left hande vnder thys title, the greater longitude) you shall seeke oute in degrees and minutes, thys difference. And do in like maner in the lower part of the table directly vnder it, & this difference so founde oute, apply à thride, or ruler, to the number founde in the hier part of the Quadrat, & also in the lower part.
            
            
               
               Spou.
               But & if the Longitude of the place vnto whiche I trauell, be lesse, thē that from whiche I departe shall I not then accompt the difference of Lōgitude from the middle Line, toward the right hand?
            
            
               Ph.
               You must so do, but now as touching the difference in Latitude of the two places, if the pole of the place (vnto which you direct your shippe) be greater, then the Pole of the place, from which you losen then accomptinge frō the middle line vpward, vnder this title, the greater Latitude, & in like case toward the right hād, then draw and extend a thrid, or apply à rulers, vnto this nūber of latitud, & wher the. ij. thrides or rulers crosse one an other, ther make à marke for it is the place which you desire.

               But where shall be placed the port from which I must depart?
            
            
               Phil.
               In the Center, or mids of the Quadrat. So that if you applie à ruler frō the Center of the Quadrate, vnto th'intersectiō of the two thrides or rulers, it shalbe manifest what point or winde, you must vse, vntill you haue finished your course.

               Phil.
               That you may at all times without difficultie bring to passe, by finding out the height of the pole: which you may do in the day, by the height of the sonne, at midday, or on the nyght, by some fixid Sterre: or (that sterre which Shipmen call) the Lode Sterre.

And now againe to oure former talke: hauing the height of the Pole found oute by instrumēt, you shall enter into the Quadrat with thys number, findinge oute the Latitude, frō the midline, vpward or downward, as before it was declared: & apply à ruler vnto the same place, noting diligentlye where this ruler, toucheth the line whiche was drawne frō the center, vnto the intersectiō of the difference of Lōgitude and Latitude first taken. Thē accōpt the like number in the differēce of Lōgitude, that you did of Latitude, and applying the ruler ther vnto, it shall shew plainly the lō
                  gitude of that presēt place, like as the line from the center, do certainly declare the coste of the worlde.

               PERCHAUNCE, ther mai arise sundry sicophāts (reading this my labour folowing) which will not let to accuse me of arrogancie, in that I take this part in hand, sence Ptolomaeus that famous Kinge hath of that argument left to vs his Geographie. Unto whome I answer, confessing me not worthy to kisse his fotesteppes, aswell for the maiestie of his person, whan he liued, as also for his excellent Learning, Science, & diligence. But seinge the hougienesse of the labor, did farre transcend not only his, but al so the diligence of anye one man (hauing none other beginning then he had) he is to be excused, though he haue not expressed throughoute his hole worke the true situation of places. For as touchinge this parte it is requisite, ether to trauell muche him selfe, or els to take obseruations of the mooste learned, whiche dwell in the Regions, for whiche he will wrighte.

But th'other part of his laboures touching the heauenlye motions (because remaininge in one place) he might beholde the Heauens, tourninge and showinge them selues, he hathe moste exactlye not only laid the foundation, but also broughte it to perfecte ende, as the noble Almegist dothe testifie. But as touchinge this my booke of Longitudes and Latitudes, I haue for the chief places of Englande vsed bothe my frendes trauailes, and also mine owne obseruations. And where as any place is taken oute of Ptolomaeus, that shall you find noted with a starre*. In whiche also thys I haue diligently obserued (hauinge. vi. sondrye examples and Copies) that where the mooste parte of them agree, that I haue onlye vsed. Also in describinge other Regions, I haue folowed th'obseruations of th'inhabitantes. As in Fraūce, I haue vsed authours, which are French men: For Spaine, Spaniardes: in Germany in like case Germaines: And in the late founde Ilandes, suche as do of them most probably treat. Moreouer, I haue for the moste parte, placed to euery Citie, Towne, & Porte, two names, th'one Latin for the cōmunitie of the tōgue, th'other as it is properly of th'inhabitauntes named.

               A PERTICVLER DESCRIPTION OF Europe: VVhich in our daies conteineth Christendome and part of Turkie.
               
                  SEing that th'Earthe inuironed, and compassed with the mightye Ocean seas, semeth as it were an Iland: th'ancient Geographers (for the better auoyding confusiō in the describing of the face of the earth (deuided it into. iij. partes, Europe, Africke and Asia. As for the fourthe parte, whiche is called America or the newe worlde, was vnto them vnknowne. Therfore at this presente, mindinge to folowe the same order, I will first begin with Europe. This parte was so called as histories do witnesse, of an amiable Ladye called Europa being daughter to King Aginor, whōe Iupiter (being rauished with her beuty) espying among à companye of other virgins, playinge by the sea side caried away out of Africke, saylinge throughe the Ponticke Seas vntyll he came into Crete. This storie the Poëtes in this wise do resite, how that Iupiter turned into à white Bul, did cari hir on his back thorow the seas into Crete, which bul was no other thing thē that in their Ensigns, & Flagges, the Cretētiās nauie bare the white Bul. This part of th'erth is pleasantly separated from Africk, by the middle earth Seas, which is so named of sundry Nations, that it norisheth. It is also parted from Asia, by the notable Riuer Tanais, whiche from the North partes with great violence runneth into Ponte Euxine.

The Heauens in this part giueth temperatnes of Aëre: th'Earth flowing with aboundance of all thinges necessary for mans vse. As Graines, Fruites, Fishe, Foule, Oyles, Wines, Catell, Metalles, & suche like. The nature of the people more ciuill, frindlyke, wise, learned, & apter vnto warres then they of Afrike, & Asia. And although it may seme much inferior to them, if you do consider the bignes, & quantitie: yet in the commodities to it belonging, it shalbe to either of them equiualēt. Morouer it is beautified with pleasaūt Ilandes, adorned with notable Riuers, & finally garnished with innumerable Cities, Townes, Fortresses, & Uillages. The length (by directe distaunce from the vttermoste confines, & borders of Spaine, vnto Constantinople in Graece the furdest place East of all Europe) conteineth after Ptolomaeus minde 2200. Englishe miles: the breadth of it to be somwhat lesser Ptolomaeus affirmeth. Notwithstanding, if you rekē the Septentrion all Regiōs, which ware to Ptolomaeus vnknowen, as Sueulande, Gothlande, Norway, & other such, you shal well perceiue the Latitude to excede the length of the same. Ther are also in Europe many perticuler Regions, as Englande, Irlande, Scotlande, Spayne, Fraunce, Germany, Italy, Polande, Unlgarie, Denmarke, Graece, & diuerse, vnto the nūber (as Ptolomaeus affirmith) of 34. Of whiche seuerallye I will set out the notable Cities & townes, mountaynes, & riuers, beginning with Irland first, as Ptolomaeus doeth in his Geographie.

And this fire can not by water be quēched, & that which is to be wondred, although the fire be marueylus great, & of force, by reason of the Sulphure, yet haye straw, or rede, is not of it cōsu med.

               A PERTICULER DESCRPTION OF AFRICA.
               
                  AFRICA, which also in Greke is named 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is the second part & portion of th'Earth. And was first so called of Iupiters daughter bering that name. But Festus saith it came of the qualitie of th'Aëre, in that coūtrey, deriuing it of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as who should say, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   that is, without horrour of coldenes: other affirme that it toke name of Afer, one of the pòsteritie of Abraham, which ouercomyng his enemies, remained in this part. It beginneth at Gaditanum Fretum (à narrow streight cōming out of th'Ocean into the middle Earth Seas, & haue Spaine on the north shore, & the Mores on the South) And it doeth ende at the Egiptiā Seas. On the North it haue the middle Earth seas, on the south shore the great Ocean, on th'East the sea, which stretche almost to the middle earth seas.
               Africke is diuided into two parts by the hyll Atlas, of whiche the lesser extendeth to the midle Earth seas: the greater part goeth beyond this hill vnto the south Oceā. The greater part of it is not inhabited for two causis: one is for th'extreme heat, being vnder the burning zone, the Sōne draweth all the moister of th'earth frō it, so that for want of water no man cā ther liue. The second is for the

innumerable multitude of venamous wormes, & wilde beastes, which are naturally ennemies vnto mankinde. As the Lion, the Olephant, the Tiger, & such like. Also, Dragons, Chrocodile, Cocatrice, & sundry other venomous Wormes, in suche sorte that th'inhabitauntes are compelled to put on botes, for better auoiding their sting, & poison. The part that is inhabited, is frutful enough. The people blacke, Sauage, Monstrous, & rude: yet in those countries, cities, & townes where the Spaniardes, Portugalles, Italians, & other do frequent, the people are sumwhat more ciuill, modest, & reasonable. Diuers also (yea right graue authors) make mētion of certaine deformed that dwell in Africk, as men with dogges heades, called Cynocephali, some with one eye & that in the forehead, named Monoculi, others without heades, & theyr face in the breast, with diuers such like which I sup pose rather fables then any truth. If you desire à longer descoure Towching Africk, hir inhabitātes, & cōmodities, read Strabo, in his 2. & 17. bokes. And also Plinius his 8. boke, with diuers other writers, which at large do herof intreate, & now I will (folowing my order begun) set out the notable regiōs (which Ptolomaeus numbreth to be 12.) with theyr chiefe Cities, Townes, hilles, & riuers, with in Africke: & first we will begin with Mauritania, which is diuided into Mauritania Tingitana, & Mauritania Caesariensi.

               OF ASIA THE THIRDE parte of th'Earth.
               
                  WHAT Asia is, and wherof it was firste so called, there is no controuersie. For all writers, as wel Historiographers, as also Geographers, make it the iij. part of th'Earth, & to take that name of Asius, sonne to kinge Cotis. And although they call it the iij. part of th'Earth, yet it is not because it conteyneth but the thirde part, but bycause it is so diuided by the seas, for of it selfe it is as much as Europe, & Africke, & conteineth (after Ptolomaeus accompt) 48. Prouinces. It is parted into Asia the greater, & Asia the lesser. Notwithstandyng diuers wryters vse this worde Asia the lesser, more largelye than Geographers doth. For they call all that portiō which is within the south shore of the ponticke seas, & th'east seas Pelagus Aegeum, & the North part of our Ocean, & the West part of the Riuer Euphrates to be Asia the lesser. Asia conteyneth in hir circuit, Bythinia Pōtus, the lesser Asia, Lycia, Galatia, Paphlagonia, Pāphilia, Capadocia, the lesser Armenia, & Cilicia. And all these after the maner of th'olde Grecians, is comprehended within this one word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   Anatolia, that is to say th'east plage or coaste. Asia dothe farre excell both Europe and

Africke. For it is so frutefull, hathe so pleasaunt fildes, such plētie of foder & pasture, the heauens geuing moisture to th'Earth in due season. It hath aboūdāce of golde mines. It bringeth forthe plentie of Cinamome, Ginger, Aloës, & diuers aromaticall spices, & Gūmes. There are diuerse straunge beastes bred in Asia, as Vnicornes, Camelles, Liberdes, Mermosites, Mercattes, Grippes. Yet one thing is to them infortunate, that there are terrible & many Earthquakes, in so much that there haue bene x. & xij. Cities at one time subuerted, & ouerthrowen. Th'inhabitauntes are sundrye, & diuers: for some are Anthropophagi, which eate the flesh of men: & drinke their bloud. Ther are also Pygmeans (men but à cubite in height) which riding on Goates, & Rāmes, do kepe warre with Cranes. Ther ar diuers other formes of inhabitauntes resited of Plinius, whiche at this present I willingly ouerpasse. The spirites in this coūtrie, by many illusions seke to bringe trauailers into daungers, sumtime by calling them by theyr names, other times by musicall noise, as it were alluringe thē by the swetnes of the sounde, vntil they be brought into danger through wilde beastes. But now these thinges omitted, (whiche would make à great volume of them selues) I will briefely set out the chiefe & principall places of Asia▪ beginnynge with Pontus, & Bythinia.

               A PERTICVLER DESCRIPTION OF suche partes of America, as are by trauaile founde out.
               
                  RIGHT order inforseth that (the iij. partes of the Earth, beynge set out accordynge to their notable partes) I shall direct my Penne to speake of America, whiche is named the fourth parte, & was to Ptolomaeus, & th' Auncient Geographers vnknowē: as also at this praesent great part of it is not yet foūd out. It taketh the name of America, of Americus Uesputius, who by the cōmaundement of Ferdinando king of Castell, founde it out, in the yeare of Christ oure Sauiour. 1497. aboute th' ende of Iune, as doeth appeare by his owne testimonie. The people bothe men, & women are naked, neither suffer they any heare to growe on their bodies, no not on their browes, the head except. They are excellent in swiming, both men & women, so that they without werines can swime ij▪ leaques. Their weapons are bowes, & arrowes, which they praepare, & head with stones, & the teath of Fishe, for that they want Iron, & all metall (gold except.) They haue warre with th' inhabitauntes of the countrey next them, which haue an other language. But it is not for richesse, for inlarging their segniory, or election of à king: but for to reuenge the deathes of their praedicessors. There is no

law or order obserued of wedlocke, for it is lawful to haue so many wemen as they affect, & to put them away with out any daunger. They be filthy at meate, & in all secrete actes of nature, comparable to brute beastes. Their bread is rotes, & theyr meate mans fleshe, for all theyr enemies, which they ouercome, they with great bankettyng deuoure. Their houses are builded like the shape of Belles, & couered with leaues & palmes of trees. they vse no kinde of Marchandise, and as for golde, Pearle, stone, & that we haue in great prise: they haue in no esti mation. For theyr richesse is in fethers of diuers colours, & stones, which they hange on their eares & lips for an ornatur. They do honour the Sonne, Mone, & Sterres. There is also in the weast part of America, à region cal led Peru, most riche of all other that hitherto haue bene founde both of meatalles, & praecious Drugges. Their shepe be of suche fertilitie, that they twise yearlye haue Lambe. Th' inhabitantes are ciuill, wise, prudēt, skilful of marchandise. But yet they know not Christ. The middes of America is in digrees. 330. 0. The pole Antarctik 10. 0. The breadth of it is 2100. English miles, the lēgth 3000. miles. There are diuers and sundry Ilandes about America, in our dayes founde oute of whiche hereafter shall folow the principall.
