            The Trauailes and miſerable Captiuitie of William Dauies, Barber-Surgion of LONDON.
            
               I Departed out of England the 28. of Ianuarie 1597. in the good ſhip named the Francis of Saltaſh, in the countie of of Cornwell, Maſter Tyball Geare, Owner, and William Lewellyn, Maſter of her, being laden with Fiſh, and Herings, and ſuch like commodities, then bound for the Strayts and to arriue at Ciuita de Vecchia to the will and pleaſure of God: where we arriued the ſixt day of March inſuing, whoſe deſcription followeth by me William Dauies Barber-Surgion of London, and borne in the Citie of Heriford.
            
            
               I. The Deſcription of Ciuita de Vecchia.
               
               
                  CIuita de Vecchia is an ancient Citie of the Popes, lyingDiſtant from England leagues 700. in low ground, a dayes iourney from Rome by land, this City lieth cloſe vpon the Sea, very ſtrongly fortified, and planted with Ordinance, to the Eaſt ſide a ſtrong Caſtle, or Fort: And alſo the like vpon the Weſt ſide, in this place the Popes Gallies lie, and ſhipping. For there is a harbour, and fayre mould for their ſafetie. For the Pope hath no other place for Ships or Gallies but Rome, and there none will come vp but ſmall Barkes, and Boates, and ſuch like, by reaſon of the ſhallowneſſe of the Riuer. In this Ciuita de Vecchia are altogether



Romanes, wholly profeſſing the Romiſh Religion, ſaying directly that the Pope is God an earth, and that he can forgiue any ſinne whatſoeuer being committed, which makes the moſt part of them, or all, runne deſperately into moſt deadly ſinnes.
               For very Murther they hold it no great ſinne, being committed, receiuing of the Popes pardon, or elſe getting into ſome Monaſterie where they may be confeſſed, and abſolued, whereby no Law can take hold of them at their comming forth, being apt and readie within a wéeke, or fortnight after to commit the like Murther, then receiuing the like pardon, or abſolution, as before they had done: and thus many bloodie minded men continue their life-time, for it is an eaſie matter for a man to haue his aduerſarie kild, or poyſoned for money, although his executioner neuer ſée him till ſuch time as he committeth this bloudie déed, being hired by another.
               Alſo in this Countrey their women are very lewde and wicked, for euen in that ancient Citie of Rome, there are many thouſands of lewd liuing women that pay monethly vnto the Pope for the ſinnefull vſe of their wicked bodies: ſome pay ſixe Crownes a moneth, and ſo from ſixe Crownes to one, for they are rated according to their outward ſhew, and for the no
                     •
                  -payment of this monethly pay, they ſhall haue their goods ſtrained and carried out of their houſes, or chambers, by the Popes officers, and kept from them till ſuch time as ſatiſfaction is made to the Pope. So it is lawfull for any man to vſe any of theſe women as his owne wife, neither ſhall he be moleſted or troubled, or otherwiſe indangered, ſo he eſcape ſecret occaſions of danger, for this woman will be as dutifull vnto him as his ſeruant, alwaies attending his pleaſure for his diet or any thing elſe belonging vnto him: he giuing her content with his purſe; but ſhe not receiuing content may as lawfully arreſt him, and caſt him into priſon till ſuch time as ſhe doth receiue ſatiſfaction, being recouered by Law: for they hold their liuings by the Pope.
               Now as I haue ſpoken of two deadly ſinnes wherein they excéed, ſo will I ſpeake of one thing wherein ſome of them are to be commended, that is this. If there be any Chriſtian, of



what Nation ſoeuer, poore and in diſtreſſe, making his caſe knowne, and aſking for Chriſts ſake, he ſhall be relieued, with all thoſe neceſſaries whereof he is deſtitute, as apparrell, meat, and drinke, and ſome money, though it be but little: if he be ſicke, then ſhall he be put into an Hoſpitall, where he ſhall be cho
                     •
                  ſely attended vpon, hauing good lodging, dai
                     •
                  tie diet, and comfortable Phiſicke for the r
                     •
                  ſtoring of his health, whether he be Papiſt or Proteſtant: but if he be a Papiſt, he ſhall be the better vſed, and if he be a Proteſtant they will vſe all meanes they can to conuert him, but force him to nothing at all. In theſe Countries it is dangerous for an Engliſhman being a Proteſtant to ſpeake any thing againſt the Pope, or his Religion, eſpecially vnto another Engliſhman that is a Papiſt, yet this Engliſh Papiſt will ſéeke all the meanes poſſible to intrappe the Proteſtant, and will ſpeake ill words of himſelfe, to draw him to the like, but when he hath made him vtter the ſecrets of his heart, then will he make it knowne, and more then the Proteſtant ſpake, to ſome chiefe man of a Church, by whom he ſhall be forced to alter his Religion, or to be burned, or put in ſome ſecret priſon where he ſhall be ſtarued to death, and this is the manner and faſhion in all Countries of Chriſtendome within the Popes Juriſdiction, not onely of the treacherie of the Engliſh Papiſts, but alſo of the other deadly ſinnes which I touched before, as their murther and adultry: and in like manner of their generall compaſſion, to a diſtreſſed Chriſtian. What I haue héere written, I ſpeake not of heare-ſay, nor by imaignation, but directly haue ſéene, and of mine owne knowledge you may ſpeake it, being too long a time amongſt them, againſt my will.
            
            
               II. The Deſcription and diſcouery of Argeir.
               
               
                  ARgeir, is a maruellous ſtrong Citie, and gouerned by theDiſtant from England leagues 480. Turk, lying vpon the ſide of an vpright hill, cloſe vpon the Sea, this Citie is very ſtrongly fortified with Caſtels, Forts,



and platformes, with great ſtore of Ordinance planted about it, alſo there are many Gallies belonging to this place, which doe much offend the Chriſtians, in taking of their ſhips, Tartanes and Satties, and other ſmall veſſels, making all the Chriſtians that they take ſlaues, & ſelling of them in their markets like horſes: for according to age and ſtrength they are priſed. This Citie is gouerned by a King, being vaſſall to the great Turke. Alſo there are great ſtore of Janizaries in it, to the number of 20. or 30000. at one time: theſe Ianizaries are chiefe Souldiers, and gouerned by a Dane, which is a generall vnder the great Turke. Theſe Turks are goodly people of parſon, and of a very faire complexion, but very villains in minde, for they are altogether Sodomites, and doe all things contrarie to a Chriſtian. For they doe neuer lye in a bed, nor féede vpon a Table; yet their féeding and diet is very plentifull, their bedding and apparrell is very neat and coſtly, the manner of their lodging is thus: There is a very faire table in a roome, about thrée yards in breadth, and as many in length ſtanding in height one yard from the ground, and thereon they vſe to ſpread a double quilt very coſtly with many curious Cuſhions, in ſtead of Pillowes, whereon he lieth downe in his ſhirt, and linnen britches onely, without any other couering, by reaſon of the heat of the countrey. Alſo in the ſame roome he hath another Table laid after the ſame faſhion very richly, whereon his wiues doe lie, but ſhe that likes him beſt, he will take to accompany him for the night. A Turke may haue as many wiues as he pleaſeth, ſo he be able to buy them, and by the number of his wiues, moſt commonly his ſubſtance is knowne, for the richer he is, the more wiues he hath, the poorer the fewer: yet neuer married to none of them, but onely the firſt, but maintaining of them all. It is very dangerous for a Chriſtian to be found in the company of any Turkes woman, for being found together, he ſhall be forced to turne Turke, or elſe be put to death, and the ſaid woman alſo ſhall be put into a ſacke, which being made faſt, ſhe ſhall be flung into the Sea, whether they commit the ſinne or not. Theſe Turkes are very zealous in their religion, acknowledging God; and Mahomet a ſoliciter



for their ſinnes. A Turke will kéepe his word if he ſweares by his head, putting his hand vpon his forehead. In this countrey there is great ſtore of gold and rich Marchants; the manner of their Churches and comming to Prayer is thus. The Church is very faire within, with many hundreds of Lampes burning therein, all matted vnder foote, without any kinde of picture, or ſeats, alſo moſt of them doe pray vpon Beads. In the morning on the top of the Church they hang out a white flag, and in the after noone a blew one for a ſigne of their comming to Church, then goeth eight or tenne of them on the very top of the Church, and crie with a loud voice. Volla, volla hamdrulla and ſhalla, that is to ſay God, God, helpe vs at thy pleaſure, and this is their ordinary warning to come to Church, as we vſe Bels in Chriſtendome, for they abhorre the ringing of Bels, being contrary to their Prophets command.
               A Turke chooſeth his firſt wife after this maner. He neuer ſéeth his wife till ſhe come to the Church to be maried, for the match is made by their friends, neither is a Turkiſh womans face to be ſéene, becauſe their faces are continually couered going through the ſtréets, both young and old: neither ſhall a manchilde after he is tenne yeeres old euer ſée his mother. A Turke is Circumciſed after this manner. The better Gentleman he is, the longer he ſtayes afore he be Circumciſed, but the time being come, then is he put vpon a very faire white horſe, being very coſtly attired, and before him goeth two, or three hundreth by two and two in purple coates, bearing waxe candles in their hands, and after them followeth a great many playing on diffuſed Inſtruments making of a great noiſe, then followeth a Bull couered with very faire Arras, and his hornes gilded, and next rideth he that ſhall be Circumciſed, with all his friends following, and thus he rideth to the place of Circumciſion, where they cut off the foreſa
                     •
                  ne of his yard, naming of him Morat, Shebane, or Hoſan, or ſome ſuch like name: then will they take the Bull, and turne his head to to the Eaſt-ward, then cut his throat, ſaying, this day wee haue done a good déed, then they cut the Bull in yeeces, and diſtribute it among his friends, and kindred, and ſo they returne



home where they doe feaſt with great ioy.
               The manner of a Chriſtian turning Turke, is thus. He is put vpon a horſe with his face towards the tayle, and a Bow and an Arrow in his hand, then the picture of Chriſt is carried before him with his feete vpwards, at the which he drawes his Bow with the Arrow therein, and thus he rideth to the place of Circumciſion, curſing his father that begate him, and and his mother that bore him, his Country, and all his kindred: then comming to the place of Circumciſion, he is Circumciſed, receiuing a name, & denying his Chriſtian name, ſo that euer after he is called a Runagado, that is, a Chriſtian denying Chriſt and turned Turke: of which ſort there are more in Turkie and Barbary then of naturall Turkes. The manner of their iudgement for offending of the Law touching death, eyther for theft or murther, is thus: within foure houres after he is taken, he is condemned by certaine chiefe Souldiers, and preſently put to death after this manner, viz. ganſhed, ſ
                     •
                  aked or beat to death. Their ganſhing is after this manner: He ſitteth vpon a wall, being fiue fadomes high, within two fadomes of the top of the wall, right vnder the place where he ſits, is a ſtrong Iron hooke faſtned, being very ſharpe, then is he thruſt off the wall vpon this hooke with ſome part of his bodie, and there he hangeth ſometimes two or thrée daies before he dieth. Staking to death is thus: Around péece of wood thrée yards long, and as big as a mans leg, being ſharpe at one end, is taken and driuen in at the fundament of the offender, and out at his ſhoulder, and ſo they let him lie till he be dead, which ſometimes will not be in a day or two. The manner of beating to death is thus: They take the offender, and lay him down vpon his backe, being naked, and with two double ropes, two ſeuerall men, one on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide of him, beate on his belly till he is dead. But theſe deaths are very ſeldome vſed, becauſe they are ſo fearefull to the offenders, yet I haue ſéene them all executed.
            
            
               
               III. The Deſcription and diſcouery of Tunys.
               
               
                  TVnys is a great Citie in Barbary, inhabited by Moores,Diſtant from En
                        •
                     land leagues▪ 600. and ſome Turkes and Jewes. This City is ſpacious, and lieth in low ground, eight miles from the Sea: there belongs to this Citie a verie fayre Caſtle, named the Galletta: This Caſtle is very ſtrong of Ord
                     •
                  ance, and gouerned by Turkes: betwixt the Citie and this Caſtle lyeth the ancient Citie of Carthage, ſunke, by the report of all the Inhabitants thereabouts: but this did I ſée my ſelfe going vp to Tunys in a Boate, the foundation of many houſes for the ſpace of foure or fiue miles, the water being very cleare, and in depth a fadome and a halfe.
               The Moores of this Countrey are altogether in Religion like to the Turkes, and alſo in habite: they are verie light of foote, and gallant horſemen: they cannot indure Hogs fleſh, nor the drinking of Wine, for they drinke water altogether, except it be ſometimes Aqua-vitae. The manner of their liuing in the Countrey is thus: They will goe fiue or ſixe hundred together, Men, Women, and Children, with their Cammels, Aſſes, and Shéepe, together with all their Poultrie, vnder the ſide of a Mountaine, where euery man pitcheth his Tent, liuing euery man to himſelfe, hauing his Wife and Children about him, with his Seruants and Cattell, thus many Tents are pitched together, to the bigneſſe of a little Towne, continuing there till ſuch time as their Cattell haue eaten vp the graſſe, and then being able to ſtay there no longer, they remooue to another place, where they liue as before they had done: and thus they doe ſpend their liues. By reaſon the Countrey is continually hotte, their féeding is plentifull, but their apparrell poore and bare, neyther haue they any, but what they buy with the increaſe of their Cattell, carrying them often to the Townes, Cities, and Market places néere, where they haue ſale for them. Theſe



Moores are very ingenious people, cunning and treacherous.
               Now leaue we Tunys in the ſame Ship that I came out of England in, named the Francis of Sal
                     •
                  aſh, being bound to Syo within the Arches of Archipelago, and fraighted with Turkiſh goods by Turkes, and ſome Turks aboord with vs, for wée traded as well with the Turke as the Chriſtian: but we had not ſailed aboue foure leagues out of our Port in the night ſeaſon, but that we were moſt fiercely ſet vpon by ſixe of the Duke of Florence his Gallies, (who being in continuall warre with the Turke, tooke vs as a Turkiſh prize) which ſpit fire like diue
                     •
                  s, to our great diſcomfort, but at length couraging of our ſelues in Gods mercies, we continued fight with them, to the loſſe of many a mans life of each fide, but all in vaine for vs, for they were fortie for one of vs, and our Sip torne downe to the water with their Ordinance, our mayne Maſt, and miſſen Maſt, ſhot by the boord, the 
                     ••
                  e end of the Maſt with all the ſayles lying in the Sea, the other end aboord: thus were we taken, and ſtript euery man ſtarke naked, and then were we diſtributed, ſome into one Gallie, and ſome into another▪ where we had as many Irons knocked vpon vs, and more, than then we were able to beare. Our Ship preſently ſent to Ligorne, being mended as well as they could, but we in the Gallies, continued a moneth before we came thither, to the loſſe of many of our liues: but at length comming thither▪ as many of vs as were left aliue were thus intertained. We w
                     •
                  re all ſhauen both head and beard, and euery man had giuen him a red coate, and a red cap, telling of vs that the Duke had made vs all Slaues, to our great woe and griefe: where I continued eight yéeres and ten moneths in this ſlauerie, as in the next diſcouerie ſhall be truly ſpoken of.
            
            
               IIII. The Deſcription and diſcouery of Ligorne.
               
               
                  LIgorne is a Citie of the Duke of Florence, and lyeth in lowDiſtant from England leagues 630. ground, hauing many towers without it, ſtanding in the



Sea, alſo to this Towne doth belong a wilde road, and two very faire moulds for the ſafetie of the Dukes Gallies. In the entrance of theſe moulds is a very ſtrong Caſtle with great ſtore of Ordnance planted: alſo the Towne is very ſtrongly fortified, for it is the chiefe garriſon of the great Dukes, where is continually great ſtore of Souldiers in pay. Which Souldiers are alwaies imployed in his ſhipping or Gallies, wherewith he doth more offend the Turke then all Chriſtendome, for they doe take Gallies and Carmizals and Brigantéens, and Townes of the Turkes and Moores: poſſeſſing of Men, Women, and Children, and ſelling them in Markets, like to Horſes, Cowes, or Shéepe, reſeruing the ſtrongeſt for his owne flauery: In this place I liued eight yéeres, and ten moneths: thrée yéeres of this time I liued in this manner, from Sunne riſing to Sunne ſet, chained in a Cart like a horſe, receiuing more blowes then any Cart-horſe in England, our diet being Bread and Water, and not ſo much Bread in thrée daies as we might haue eaten at once, thus we were vſed to goe fortie or fiftie Carts together, being all ſlaues: our lading would be Sand, or Lyme, or Bricke, or ſome ſuch like, and to draw it whither the Officers appointed vs, for their buildings. Theſe Italians are very deceitfull people, for when they laugh in a mans face, they will ſéeke to kill him, yet they are very cowards being naturall Italians: their women are altogether wicked and lewde. Thrée yéeres being ſpent in this manner: all we Engliſh▪men were called as many as were left aliue, making choiſe of the ableſt of vs to goe into the Gallies, of which I was one choſen, then did my miſerie increaſe many-fold, for then I was made a Gally▪ſlaue to row at an Oare, where our former diet leſſened▪ but blowes increaſed, to the loſſe of many of our liues. We were ſhauen Head and Beard euery eight or tenth day, being alwaies naked, but onely a payre of linnen bréeches and chaines continually. In this time I was at the taking of many a Towne and Gally of the Turkes, though ſore againſt my will, ſéeing of many Cities, Ilands, and mayne Lands in the time of my ſlauerie, where I continued ſixe yéeres a Gally-ſlaue,



finding in all this time much comfort and reliefe from Engliſh Marchants that were Proteſtants, and alſo from many Engliſh Maſters and owners of Ships. But from Engliſh men being Papiſts none at all. The miſerie of the Gallies doth ſurpaſſe any mans iudgement or imagination, neyther would any man thinke that ſuch torture, or torment were vſed in the world, but onely they that féele it, the extreamitie of miſerie cauſeth many a ſlaue to kill themſelues, or elſe ſéeke to kill their Officers; but we were not ſuffered to haue ſo much as a knife about vs, yea if we had gotten one by any extraordinarie meanes, and offered any violence to any Officer, we ſhould preſently haue loſt our noſe and eares, and receiued a hundred blowes en our bare backe, and a hundred on our belly with a double rope, or a Buls piſ
                     •
                  e, continuing a ſlaue ſtill: But I intreated the Almightie God to grant me grace that I might indure it patiently, that féeling that extreamitie in bodie in this world, how farre would the torments of hell haue ſurpaſſed and excéeded it, if I had in this my earthly torture béene acceſſary to mine owne death, as many were. But at length God of his great goodneſſe and mercy, deliuered me (according to my hope) in this manner. The great Duke fitted a ſhip▪ a Tartane and a Frigot, being very well appointed and victualled, diſpeſing of them into the Weſt Indies, and chiefely for the Kiuer of the Amazons, appointing Captaine Robert Thornton, an Engliſhman to be chiefe Commaunder of the Ship, the Tartane and the Frigot: ſo likewiſe was euery other Officer appointed by the Duke himſelfe; inſomuch as ſpeaking of the placing of a Phiſition, a Surgion, and a Surgions mate, Captaine Thornton ſtanding by, ſaid, your Highneſſe may doe well to deliuer a poore Engliſhman that hath continued a great while in your Gallies: hée is well experimanted in P
                     ••
                  ſicka, and Surgery, by reaſon of his long practiſe both by Sea an Land: he is hardned to the Sea, and able to diſcharge the place better then the thrée before mentioned: for in the Gallies he doth your Highnes but the labour of one ſlaue: whereupon the Duke demaunded my name. Captaine Thornton anſwered, and ſaid, William Dauies: whereto the Duke



replied, I haue often béene ſpoken to for that fellow, whoſe liberty now I giue vpon thy good report, Thornton, but yet I doubt his vſage hath béene ſo hard in my Countrey, that as ſoone as hée is out of chaynes, he will giue me the ſlip and not goe the voyage into the In
                     •
                  ies with thée. But if he can giue fiue hundred Crownes ſecuritie to goe the voyage, hée ſhall be releaſed preſently out of chaynes: neyther ſhall hée want any thing that is needfull for the voyage, 
                     •
                  or the good of all the Company, or for his owne bodie, and this let him vnderſtand as ſoone as may be: which newes came within two dayes vnto me, to my great reioycing & comfort, but as ſoone as I heard it, I ſodainly ſate down, being at my ol
                     •
                   profeſſion, carrying of durt, and ſtone, and ſuch like in a baſket, and would worke no longer, neyther ſuffer the ſlaue to worke that was chayned vnto mée, but as ſoone as I was eſpied, one of the Maſters of the worke came to mée, and ſaid thou Lutheran Dogge: Why workeſt thou not? and with that ſtrake me with a Cudgell, whereto the ſlaue that was chayned with me, replied. The Duke hath giuen him his libertie: then ſaid hée that had ſtroken mée, Maſter, I beſeech you forgiue mée, and excuſe my raſhneſſe, doubting that I ſhould haue remembred his former courteſies being at libertie. And within a ſhort time after Captaine Thorneton came from Florence to Ligorne, where I was, who then tolde mee the Dukes diſpoſition to the full, and vpon what ſecuritie I ſhould be deliuered: which ſecuritie I did ſodainely procure by an Engliſh Marchant, whoſe name was Maiſter William Mellyn, of Briſtow, who paſſed his Band for fiue hundred Crownes to the Duke, for the performance of the voyage by mée: Whereupon I was ſodainely releaſed out of chaynes, to my great reioycing, giuing God thankes for his bleſſings. Then was I preſently well apparrelled by Captaine Thorneton, and this Marchant, wanting nothing whereof I was deſtitute: But within two or three dayes after I was ſent for, by the great Duke, to come vnto him to Archemeyne, where then hée continued, whither ſodaynely I repayred, and comming to the Dukes preſence,



doing my dutie, he ſaid vnto me, be of good comfort I haue giuen thée grace, with thy liberty, neyther ſhalt thou want any thing for the fitting of thy voyage, or néedful for thy owne bodie, therefore ſpeake boldly, and demaund any thing that ſhall be neceſſary, and I will haue thée well fitted: for the great Duke of Florence wants no money. Then he demaunded of me further what I was in mine owne Countrey, whither I was a Gentleman or no. I anſwered his highneſſe I was: then he aſked me how? I told him my father was a Gentleman, and for my part I had ſerued my Quéene by Lano and by Sea, againſt the aduerſaries of my Quéene and Countrey, and had loſt mine owne bloud, and ſpilt my enemies bloud: and next that I was a Gentleman by Art. Then the Duke anſwered and ſaid: Thou art a worthy fellow, for thou haſt indured much miſerie in this world. But tell me, quoth hée, with what ſubſtance of wealth cameſt thou out of thy Countrey: I anſwered with two purſes full: Full ſaid hée, of what? I ſaid of Siluer and Gold, which I loſt when I was taken by his Highnes Gallies, and the other full of Patience, which doth continue full ſtill: Then ſaid the Duke to one that ſtoode by, giue him a hundred Crownes to ſpend to ſtrengthen himſelfe, and bring himſelfe to courage; thus did the Duke take delight in diſcourſing with me, in reſpect I ſpake the Italian tongue very perfectly, for I bought it déere, with many a droppe of my bloud, in the time of my ſlauerie. Then receiuing this hundred Crownes, which the Duke had giuen me, I left his Court, comming preſently to Ligorne, where the Ship lay, indeauoring of my ſelfe, by my labour, and induſtrie, for the fitting of all things neceſſary for the good of the Uoyage, vpon the Dukes charge, beſides this hundred Crownes: for they were giuen mée to ſpend at my owne pleaſure, which I did, to the comfort of many Engliſh-men that lay in chaines, that were taken with mée: they wanted neyther meate nor drinke as long as my money laſted, as many of them as were left aliue, for of ſeuen and thirtie of vs that were taken at the firſt, there remayned then but thirtéene, whereof tenne continued in chaines, and two were deliuered with me. By this time



all things were prepared and made readie for the performance of our pretended Uoyage, now being bound to ſerue in the good Ship called the Santa Lucia, with a Frigot, and a Tartane, well victualled, and well manned, and chiefely bound to the Riuer of Amazones, with other ſeuerall Riuers, the which the Duke would haue inhabited, hoping for great ſtore of gaine of Gold, but the Countries did affoord no ſuch thing, as hereafter ſhall be ſpoken of. Upon this Uoyage we were fouretéene moneths, making little gaine, or benefit for the Duke, for there was nothing to be gained. Now are we homewards bound, and recouering the ſtraits againe, & being within three or foure dayes ſayle of our owne Port, Ligorne: in the night ſeaſon we met with an Engliſh Pirate, who would haue taken vs, but was not able, yet held vs fight all the whole night, and kild vs a man, and hurt other two: whereof one was an Engliſhman, who died within two dayes after we recouered Ligorne, and being dead I went to the Captaine and demaunded of him where he ſhould be buried, but he 
                     •
                  ad him goe aſke of one father Sherwood an Engliſhman, ſo he told mée that if he were a Romane Catholike they would burie him in the Church, but if he were not, I ſhould bury him out in the fields: But yet for my better aſſurance I went and aſked of the Friers of the Miſericordia, who alſo gaue their aduiſe, and counſell that he ſhould be buried in the fields, becauſe he was no Romane Catholike, whereupon I buried him in this manner.
               I intreated the company of many Engliſhmen that were Proteſtants to helpe me to ſhroud him, and alſo to accompany me to the burying of him, which they did in this manner. We put him vpon a Beare, being ſhrowded with a couering ouer him, and carried by foure men, many Engliſhmen that were Proteſtants followed him, bearing euery man a branch of Roſemary in his hand to the place where we buried him, reading Prayers ouer him after the Engliſh manner. His name that was buried was Eraſmus Lucas, and borne in Southwarke néere vnto London. Two daies being ſpent after his buriall, & was ſought for by an Italian Fryer, who finding of me, demaunded



of me my name, which preſently I told him, then he replied, thou art he that I looke for, for thou haſt buried a good Chriſtian, and a Romane Catholike out in the fields, like to a Dog and a Lutheran as thou art thy ſelfe: therefore I charge thée in the Dukes name to goe along with mée, which command I durſt not denie, but went with him, where he brought me before thrée or foure aged Friers of the Inquiſition, & they aſked of me whether I were that Lutheran that buried a good Chriſtian in the fields, for he was a Romane Catholike, and confeſt, and receiued the Sacrament like to a good Chriſtian, and therefore thou ſhalt be burned, for thou haſt done contrary to the Law of Rome. I anſwered that I had buried a good Chriſtian, but not a Romane Catholike, neither was he confeſt, nor receiued the Sacrament: they replied, if this be not true which thou haſt ſaid thou ſhalt ſurely die for it. Therefore take him, and put him into the ſecret, whither vnto I was brought, which is a priſon in this manner: Many double doores being opened, I paſſed through two or thrée outward priſons then comming to the doore of the ſecret, whereinto I was thruſt, it was ſo darke that I could ſée no part of my body, then féeling round about me with my hands, I found it to be very ſhort in length, & leſſe in breadth, but of height I know not how high, becauſe I could neither ſée nor féele the top. In this place I was almoſt ouer ſhoes in the filth of other men that had died there before, who neuer liued aboue eight or ten daies there at the moſt: Then wrapping one arme within another, and leaning againſt the wall, calling to minde Iobs miſeries and Daniels afflictions amidſt the Lions, and incouraging my ſelfe in Gods mercy, ſung a Pſalme very chéerefully to the praiſe and glory of God, wherein I was greatly comforted. Then did I draw off my ſhoes and ſtockings, & with my bare féete ſwept all the traſh and filth into one corner. In this manner I liued fortie houres before any ſléepe poſſeſt me, and then being deſirous of ſléepe, I ſate downe and leaned my head againſt the wall, and ſlept very ſoundly, being altogether comforted with a liuely hope in the Almighty God, that he would deliuer me (according to my truſt) as he had done before. And when moſt extreames



would oppreſſe me, then would I be moſt ioyfull, finding alwaies an inward motion, ſaying, be of good comfort, the Lord will deliuer thée: In this manner I liued ſixtéene daies, my food being bread & water, and my lodging vpon the cold ſtones, and being yet aliue, they held it a miracle that I ſhould liue there ſo long, ſaying, this Lutherane hath a Lions heart, for we neuer knew any to liue aboue ten daies, wherfore let vs haue him forth to be examined. Then was I brought before the high Inquiſitioner, who demanded of me, whether he that I buried had receiued the Sacrament & confeſt, according to the Romane order or no, I anſwered no; he was a good Chriſtian, but receiued not the Sacrament, nor was not confeſt, after the order of Rome: then he ſaid that he was, by a Frier of the Meſericordia, & therefore thou ſhalt be burned. Then I intreated that I might but ſpeake, and he ſaid ſpeake on: then I aſked them this, whether the Frier that confeſt him could ſpeak any Engliſh or no, he anſwered that he could ſpeake none: then tell me quoth I, how an Italian Frier (can confeſſe an Engliſhman ſpeaking no Engliſh, nor the Engliſhman ſpeaking no Italian, nor other language but his mother tongue? for you know wel there muſt be no interpreter in confeſſion, & if the Sacrament were miniſtred vnto him, the houſe where he died can iuſtifie it. Then the Inquiſitioner hearing this, ſcratched his head, ſaying, this fellow hath ſpoken the truth, wherfore take him and put him out into a large priſon, whether I was brought, where I liued ten wéeks being well, and often relieued by Engliſh Proteſtants, who reioyced much to ſee me aliue. Theſe malicious Friers, there reaſon wherefore they ſought my life was, becauſe they would haue the dead mans pay to themſel

Ten wéeks being ſpent in this priſon, it was the fortune of one M. Richard Row of Milbrooke, in the countie of Cornwel, to ariue at Ligorne, in the good ſhip called the Portion he being owner & Marchant of the ſaid ſhip, & one day comming



to the Priſon grate demaunded of me what Countrey-man I was, I told him I was borne in the Citie of Hereford. He aſked my name: I anſwered William Dauies. Said he, know you one Maſter Dauies in Plymmouth. I ſaid I was an vnfortunate brother of his. With that he was very ſorely grieued, in reſpect he knew my brother very well, and loued him directly, and told me if all the meanes that he could vſe could deliuer me, he would: therefore ſaid hée, thinke with your ſelfe, how I may deliuer you, and I will be backe againe with you within theſe two or thrée houres: whereupon he deliuered me ſixe Crownes, and bid me ſpare for no money, for he knew my brother would repay it againe: then leauing me, I ſate downe and leaned my head vpon my hand, ſetting my elbow vpon my knée, intreating my Almightie God, to ſhew me ſome direct courſe whereby I ſhould be deliuered. Then preſently came into my head, to ſend for a Frenchman, in whoſe houſe I had alwaies layne before, who preſently came vnto me, vnto whom I imparted my minde, telling of him that if he would faine a matter of debt againſt me, I would giue him ten Crownes for his labour, though I ought him nothing: but he anſwered and ſaid it was dangerous, for it was a Gally-matter, but I vewed it ſhould neuer be made knowne by me: Whereupon he gaue conſent, and went to the Gouernour and told him, that in the Priſon where debters are, there is an Engliſhman who oweth me money, and we were agréed, then ſaid the Commiſſarie if thou art content, let him pay the charge of the houſe, and be gone: which charge I paid preſently, and was fréed, departing away with the Frenchman, and brought him to Maſter Hunts houſe, the Engliſh Counſell, where I gaue him his tenne Crownes. So leauing one another, I went preſently aboord of Maſter Rowes Ship, being then bound for Naples, vnto which place wée came, whoſe deſcription followeth.

                  ners there. In this Citie they ſpeake ſeuerall Chriſtian languages, becauſe there are of all Nations in Chriſtendome but principally Italians, and Spanyards. The Neopolitans are very proud, and of a leftie ſpirit, being for the moſt part very rich, and coſtly attired, and moſt commonly well furniſhed inwardly with their Countrey diſeaſe. They are altogether Papiſts, and their women very audacious, eſpecially in the ſinfull vſe of their bodies, by reaſon they haue as well their pardon as priuiledge from Rome. In this Citie it is verie dangerous to walke by night, for a man may ſodainly be kild for the cloathes on his backe, whither hée be poore or rich. In this place are alwaies great ſtore of Marchants and Lidgers of ſeuerall Countries, as ſpecially Engliſh, Dutch, Greekes, Italians, Uenetians, French, Spaniard, Jew, with many other Chriſtian Nations. The chiefe commoditie that theſe Merchants deale in, is

In this place I haue béene diuers times, and neuer found any thing note-worthy, but onely one, which was this. A mine vnderneath a great Mountaine about a mile or thereabouts in length.

ſhipping doth ſtop before they come to the Citie; The reaſon wherefore this paſſage was inuented, is becauſe the mountaine ouer it is ſo ſléepe that there was no paſſage ouer it, except they would goe twentie miles about, but now Coaches, Wagons Carts, horſe or foote may paſſe as ſmoothly through as in a plaine way, continually hanging within it great ſtore of Lampes: this vault is in height about fiue fadame, and foure in breadth, it is named the Grout, & by common report one Virgil a learned man was the Author of it, whoſe Tombe is aloft in each end of it, hauing a Lampe hanging continually before it: Through this place I haue oft and many times paſſed: and therefore vpon my owne knowledge I can aſſure what I haue written.

                   about them to couer any part of their nakedneſſe, the man taketh a round Cane as big as a penny candle, and two inches in length, through the which he puls the fore-ſkin of his yard, tying the ſkin with a péece of the rinde of a tree about the bigneſſe of a ſmall packethréed, then making of it faſt about his middle, he continueth thus till he haue occaſion to vſe him. In each eare he weareth a Réed or Cane, which he bores through it, about the bigneſſe of a Swans quill, and in length halfe an inch, and the like through the midſt of the lower lip: alſo at the bridge of the noſe he hangs in a Reed a ſmall glaſſe Bead or Button, which hanging directly afore his mouth, flies too and fro ſtill as he ſpeaks, wherein he takes great pride and pleaſure. He weares his hayre long, being rounded below to the nether part of his eare, and cut ſhort, or rather as I iudged pluckt bald on the crowne like a Frier. But their women vſe no faſhion at all to ſet forth themſelues, but ſtarke naked as they were borne, with haire long of their heads, alſo their breaſts hang very low, by reaſon they are neuer laced or braced vy: they do vſe to annoynt their bodies, both men and women, with a kinde of red earth, becauſe the Muskitas or Flies ſhal not offend them. Theſe people are very ingenious, craftie▪ and treacherous, very light of foote, and good Bowemen, whoſe like I haue neuer ſeene, for they doe ordinarily kill their owne foode, as Beaſts, Fowle, and Fiſh, the manner of their Bow and Arrowes is this. The Bow is about two yards in length, the Arrow ſeauen foot. His



Bowe is made of Brazill wood very curious, his ſtring of the rinde of a Trée, lying cloſe to the Bow, without any bent, his Arrow made of a Réed, and the head of it is a fiſh bone, hée kils a beaſt in this manner: ſtanding behinde a Trée, hée takes his marke at the beaſt, and wounding him, he followes him like a Bloud-hound till he fall, oftentimes ſeconding his ſhoote: then for any fowle be he neuer ſo little, he neuer miſſes him: as for the firſt, he walkes by the water ſide, and when he hath ſpied a fiſh in the water, he preſently ſtrikes him with his Arrow, and ſodainly throwing downe his Bow, he leaps into the water, ſwimming to his Arrow which he drawes a-land with the fiſh faſtned to it, then hauing each kild his owne ſood, as well fleſh, and fowle, as fiſh, they méet together, to the number of fiftie or ſi

                  ituate very néere one another. This Iland is gouerned by a great Maſter, who acknowledgeth no Superiour vpon earth, but the Pope to be Supreame head of the Church. The great Maſter liues in Terra-noua, which is a great Citie, lying cloſe vpon the Sea, marueilous ſtrongly fortified and planted with Ordnance the like is not in Chriſtendom, for the Turke hath oftentimes ſought to take it, with two or thrée hundred ſayle of Gallies at a time, but yet was neuer able to take any part of it. To this Iland doth there belong Gallies, though they be but few, to the number of ſixe or eight ſayle, and alſo ſhipping, wherewith they doe much offend the Turke, taking of them very often, and making them ſlaues: In this Iland they hold the Romiſh Religion, both men and women, their women are altogether laſciuious and lewdly giuen, but there men are valiant, Gentlemen, and worthy men at armes: they are of all Nations of Chriſtendome, ſpeaking generally all languages, alſo they haue an ancient order of Knighthood, ſworne by the Croſſe of Saint Iohn, which is a forked white Croſſe which they weare vpon their breaſts to be knowne to be C

                     •
                  liers and Knights of Malta. The manner of their▪ Oath of Knighthood is this: that they ſhall neuer marry, by reaſon they ſhall neuer haue Children legitimate: for there are many Lords



and Noble men ſent thither by their Uncles to be Knighted, becauſe they ſhall neuer marry, whereby after his death his lands ſhall come to his Uncles iſſue, yet they are ſuffered to haue as many whores as they will. Another part of their oath is this. A Knight of Malta is ſworne not to ſtand in place where two, thrée, or foure are vpon one in fight, but to take the weaker part, & to fight to the laſt. They are all of bold courage, being to the number of fiue thouſand or there abouts, in Malta and other Chriſtian places: another part of their oaths is this, by Land or Sea, whether it be in ſhip or Gally, they are ſworne to incounter their aduerſaries, though they be thrée to one, and neuer to yéeld or ſlip away, for they are ſworne to fight it to the laſt mans death: The which oath they performe very couragiouſly, for they are Gentlemen of very great reſpect, neyther will they euer fall out amongſt themſelues, being forbidden by another part of their oath. As for their maintenance, the poorer ſort haue a pention from the great maſter, which maintains him very gallant, and the richer ſort liue vpon their owne charge. One thing there is ſtrange in that Iland, thoſe that are borne without the cities ſpeak altogether the Moriſco tongue, being altogether like Moores. This Iland is very plentifull and fruitful of all things, eſpecially, Wine, Corne, Fiſh, Fleſh, and Fruits. Theſe Knights are very mercifull, hauing their aduerſaries proſtrate, greatly regarding their Oath.

breath of God, and by the Jewes put to death, but they doe not beléeue that he is riſen again. They hate a Jew aboue any nation euen as they do the diuel, neither do they care to kill him, no more then they doe a dog, oftentimes killing them in the very ſtréets vpon the leaſt occaſion, if it be but for touching his garment as he paſſeth by him: yet their liues many Jewes in all parts of the Turkes dominions, but in this manner.

of them doe the labour of ſixe Oxen: their hornes are flat, and at mid-day when they vſe to reſt them, they take them, and turne them into a water, where they will ſtand for the ſpace of two houres couered quite ouer the backes in water, then will they yoke them and worke them as freſh till night, as they did in the Morning, without any bayting at all. Their Cammels is a meruailous tall beaſt, hauing a necke twiſe as long as a Horſe, and a great bunch growing about the middle of his backe, as bigge as a pecke, hée is clouen footed, and his tayle little, and for his ſtrength he will carry as much on his backe as foure horſes, and continue with his carriage on his backe thréeſcore houres without meat or reſt. I haue ſéene foure thouſand of them laden at one time with Merchandiſe going a very ſlow pace, and nothing ſo faſt as a Carriers horſe, yet will they continue that pace two dayes and two nights together, without any eating or drinking: and when they doe reſt and féede, it is but ſlender and verie little, in this manner: when they come to their reſting place they lye downe with their lading vpon their backes. Then the Moores or Turkes, put a Ball made of Date ſtones beaten, into euery one of their mouthes, the pouder of the ſtones being compounded with Linſéede Oyle, and the white of Egges, which makes the Balls as hard as Stones, and thus they will liue and continue their trauaile ſixtéene dayes and nights together, receiuing the ſaid reſt and reliefe at euery two dayes end. Their Shéepe are twiſe as bigge as ours in England, but in all faſhions like our Shéepe, except the tayle, for their tayles are meruailous great, broad, and thicke, being very fat, for I haue weighed many of their tayles flayed from the Butchers, and they haue waighed ten, eleuen, and twelue pound waight, and throughout all Barbarie and Turkie, they haue plenty of theſe beaſts, and alſo all kind of beaſts that we haue in England. There liue many Gréekes in all parts throughout the Turkes Dominions, but in great bondage and pouertie: they are good Chriſtians, abhorring the Idolatry of Rome, and obſeruing the ſame computation for Chriſtmaſſe and other feſtiuals, that we doe in England.
               
               
                  Alſo there are Jewes in all parts of Turkie and Barbary, and all parts of Chriſtendome, England excepted: yet though they be thus diſperſed throughout moſt parts of the world, liuing in extreame ſlauery, yet ſhall you not ſee one Jew begge his bread. One thing I haue greatly maruelled at, that a Jew is reſpected more in Chriſtendome, then with the Turks: for the Turks (as you haue heard) deteſts him aboue any Nation, tying him to a notable and knowne marke, or manner of apparrell, and yeelding him no Law or right, eyther againſt Turke or Chriſtian: whereas, contrarywiſe, in Chriſtendome, he is tyed to no manner of weare, but may goe in what ſhape he liſts: and for Law, by reaſon of his wealth, hee ſhall ſooner haue right done to him then a Chriſtian: wherefore in my minde, the Turke greatly in this condemnes the Popiſh Chriſtian: for it is an ordinary ſaying with them, tha

                   if a Jew had put Mahomet to death, nay, but touched the hem of his garment violently, they would not haue left one of the race of them aliue, nor yet any thing, or building vnraced, that might procure their memory. But in Chriſtendome they are ſuffered to build Sinagogues, and to vſe their Religion publikely. But I beſeech the Almightie God that this our Land of England may neuer be defiled, eyther by Pope, Turke, or Jew.

They profeſſe the Romiſh Religion through out this Iland both men and Women, ſpeaking the Italian tongue generally, as many as be borne in the Iland, and are called Sicillianes. Mercina being another famous Citie, lyeth cloſe vpon the Sea, and is ſcituated vpon high ground, vnder the foote of a great Mountayne. This City is ſtrongly fortified and planted with O

This Iland is very high and long, poynting Eaſt and Weſt: the North-ſide of it very pleaſant, with great ſtore of Gardens and Uineyards, and ſuch like: but very barren to the Southward-ſide, with great Rocks, Cliffs, and Mountaynes, which part is inhabited by poore Gréekes: and alſo there are many ſmall Ilands vnder theſe Cliffs, inhabited likewiſe by Gréekes, as Chriſtiana and Godza, with others more. Theſe Gréekes liue all together in bondage to the Uenetians. The North-ſide of this Iland is inhabited by Italians, and ſome Jewes. There are two very fayre Cities: (viz.) Candia, and Acony, theſe Cities are inhabited moſt with Uenetians, ſtrongly fortified and planted with Ordnance. Theſe Cities lye right againſt the entring of the Arches of Appellican, which goeth to Conſtantinople, where the Great Turke continues, receiuing tribute of the Duke of Venice for this Iland, and other parts, for the Uenetian is tributary to the Great Turke. Alſo the Great Turke kéepes him in ſubiection by Land and Sea, neither dare the Uenetian ioyne their forces with any Chriſtian, at any time whenſoeuer a Fléete of Gallies and Shipps is ſet forth againſt the Turke, yet the Duke of Uenice hath twiſe as many Gallies as any Chriſtian Prince whatſoeuer, which he doth employ, ſome of them in Marchandize, hauing continuall trading both with Chriſtian and Turke, and ſome of his Gallies continually lieth about the entring of the Gulph of Venice, about the Iland of Zant and Saphlany, and the ſmall Iland of the Strauales, and néere about Madona: theſe parts doe they defend from any Chriſtian men of warre, or Chriſtian Gallies, or eyther Gallies or Briggantéens of the Turkes that ſhall approach néere vnto theſe parts, in the manner and faſhion of



men of Warre: and oftentimes the ſayd Gallies doe take both Chriſtian and Turke, making Slaues of the men, or elſe chopping off of their heads; for it is lawfull for him ſo to doe, by the concluſion betwixt Him, the Chriſtian, and Turke, taking them within twentie leagues compaſſe of the entrance of his Gulph, but not in any other part of the Sea, without the ſaid compaſſe.

And this is their vſe once a yéere, whereby this Iland is altogether inhabited by Women. There is one thing more to be wondred at, that I haue alſo ſéene, that is to ſay, very good Oyſters and Muskles growing vpon trées, for I haue eaten my part of many an hundred of them. And for your better vnderſtanding how they grow, you ſhall know that the Trées ſtand néere the Sea ſide, and at euery full tyde the bowes hang into the Sea a fadome, or a fadome and a halfe, ſo that when the tyde goeth out, they are found hanging in great cluſters vpon the branches, like Barnacles to the ſide of a ſhip, and at the comming in of the tyde, they receiue their moyſture.

            The Concluſion of the Booke: to the Reader.
            THus farre (gentle Reader) I thought good, out of my ſlender capacitie, to acquaint thée with a briefe and plaine diſcourſe of my Trauell, which though it be rude, as comming from a barren brayne, which profeſſeth nothing leſſe then learning: yet aſſure thy ſelfe it containes vndoubted truth, being no more then I haue ſéene, knowne, and to my griefe and perill felt. And if any, as well or better acquainted with theſe Parts, or any of them, whereof I make mention, diſliking the rudeneſſe of my ſtile, will vndertake to refine it, hée giues me no diſcontent, ſo he derogate not from the truth thereof. And whereas I made promiſe in the beginning of this Treatiſe, in theſe twelue diſcourſes, to touch or ſpeake ſomething of the reſt of the places, ſpecified in the Table, I haue partly performed it: but to haue written of them at large, would haue béene but friuolous and ſuperfluous, partly becauſe they are places of no extraordinary note, but ſpecially becauſe they doe in moſt, or all things, agrée with the Countries to which they are annexed, and tributaries, or vaſſalls: as the Ilands tributary to the Spaniards, follow their manner of gouernment, cuſtomes, and orders. The Turkiſh tributaries imitate them in moſt things: and ſo you may iudge of the reſt, according as they are ſeuerally diſtinguiſhed. And ſo much may ſuffice to cléere that doubt. Now the reaſons that vrged me to publiſh this Booke are manifold, but chiefly three: The firſt was, to keepe in record, and make knowne my owne miſery, leſt with the forgetfull Butler in Pharaos Priſon, who being deliuered forgat his promiſe made to Ioſeph. that foretold his deliuery: ſo I (ſuch is infirmitie and frailtie of humane nature) might (cheaked with worldly proſperitie forget my mercifull and mightie Deliuerer. The ſecond was, that others (warned by my miſery) might ſhun the like. The laſt and chiefeſt reaſon was, to glorifie God, eſpecially heere in England, which aboue all earthly Countries and Nations is moſt bound to extend and ſet forth his glory. For what



Chriſtian, reading but the extreame thraldome and puniſhment he hath inflicted vpon the Jewes, euen to this houre, being a Nation he had once ſelected to himſelfe from amongſt all the Nations of the earth. Or the preſent miſery of the Gréekes, who once were Monarches of the Earth, and one of the chiefeſt Churches of Chriſtendome, being the firſt fruits of the Gentiles, whoſe extreame bondage is now lamentable, yet not with the Iſraelites, ſacrificing their children to Idols, but forced to giue as well the tenth of their children, as of their ſubſtance to that monſtrous Mahumetan Idoll the Turke. Or who, duly pondering the blindneſſe and obſtinacie of the Spaniards, Pope, and Italians, with the horrible and abſurd ſinnes that God hath giuen them ouer to: Or who, ſéeing the Infidelitie of the ſimple Indian (well may I call him ſimple, becauſe his errour grows more of want of true knowledge then obſtinacie) who worſhips the creature, being ignorant of the Almightie Creator? What Engliſh heart (I ſay) duly pondering theſe things in generall, or any one of theſe things in particular, can otherwiſe chooſe but falling downe on his bended knées, yéeld God immortall and innumerable thanks and prayſe-giuing, not onely for electing him aboue all other Nations of the Earth, to the true and perfect knowledge of his bleſſed Goſpell, but alſo for preſeruing him ſo long from ſo many miſeries and wretched thraldomes, whereunto moſt Nations of the Earth are ſubiect?
