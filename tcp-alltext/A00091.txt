            ¶ ITEM where as certayne articles were lately deuiſed and put forth by the kynges highnes auctoritie, and condeſcended vpon by the preiates and clergy of this his realme in conuocation, wherof part are neceſſary to be holden and beleued for our ſaluation: and thother part do concerne and touche certayne laudable ceremonies, rites, and vſages of the churche, mete and cōuenient

            ¶ Beſides this, to thintent that al ſuperſtition, and hipocriſy, crept into diuers mens hartes, may vanyſhe awaye, they ſhall not ſet forth, or extoll any ymages, relyques, or myracles, for any ſuperſtytion or lucre, nor allure the people by any inticementes to the pilgremages of any ſainct, otherwiſe than is permitted in the articles, lately put forth by thauctorite of the kinges maieſtie, and condeſcended vpon by the prelates and clergie of this his realme, in conuocaiton, as thoughe it were propre or peculyar to that ſaynct, to giue this commoditie or that, Seinge all goodnes, helth, and grace, ought to be both aſked and loked for, only of god, as of the very author of the ſame, and of none other: For without hym it can not be gyuen. But they ſhall exhorte as wel theyr pariſhoners as other pilgrimes, that they do rather apply them ſelfe to the keping of goddes commaundementes, and fulfilling of his workes of charitie, perſwadinge them, that they ſhal pleaſe god more by the true exercyſynge of theyr bodyly labour, trauayle, or occupation, and prouiding for their families, than if they went about to the ſayd pilgrimages, and that it ſhal profyte more theyr ſoule helth, if they do beſtowe that on the poore and nedy, whiche they wolde haue beſtowed vpon the ſaid ymages or relyques.
            ¶ ALSO in the ſame theyr ſermons and other collations, the perſons, vycars, and other curates aforeſaid, ſhal diligently admoniſhe the fathers and mothers, maiſters, and gouernours of youthe, beynge within theyr cure, to teche or cauſe to be taught theyr chyldren and ſeruantes, euen from theyr infancy, theyr Pater noſter, tharticles of our fayth, and the tenne commandementes in theyr mother tonge: And the ſame ſo taught, ſhall cauſe the ſayd youthe ofte to repete and vnderſtande. And to thintent this may be the more eaſily done, the ſayde curates ſhal in theyr ſermons deliberately and plainly recite of the ſaid pater noſter, articles, or commandementes, one clauſe or artycle one daye, and an other an other daye, tyll the hole be taught and lerned by lyttell and lyttell (And ſhall delyuer the ſame in writinge, or ſhewe where printed bokes conteyninge the ſame be to be folde, to them that can reede, or

For as moche as we may dayly ſee, through ſlouth and ydelnes, dyuers valiant men fal, ſome to beggynge, and ſome to thefte and murder, which after brought to calamitie and myſery, impute a great parte therof to theyr frendes and gouernours, whiche ſuffred them to be brought vp ſo idelly in theyr youthe, where if they had ben wel educated and brought vp in ſome good litterature, occupation, or miſterye, they ſhulde (beinge rulers of theyr owne familie) haue profyted as well them ſelfe, as dyuers other perſons, to the great commoditie and ornamentes of the common weale.

And alwayes lett

                them ſe, that nother they nor theyr vycars do ſeke more theyr owne profyte, promotion, or aduantage, than the profyte of the ſoules, that they haue vnder theyr cure, or the glory of God.

Euer gentylly and charitably exhortynge them, that vſynge a ſobre and a modeſte hauiour in the redynge and inquyſition of the trewe ſenſe of the ſame, they doo in no wyſe ſtyffely or eygrely contende or ſtryue one with an other about the ſame, but referre the declaration of thoſe places, that be in controuerſie, to the iudgement of them that be better lerned.
