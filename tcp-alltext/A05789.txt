            ¶Forthermore, I haue not gyuen meate to the hungry / drynke to ye thrysty / lodged the harbourlesse / clothed the naked / vysyted the syke / counforted & releefte the men in prisone / for I haue not expended of how greate waight these wordes of thy sonne my sauiour Christ ar, neyther beleued hym saynge.

            ¶ The preface / vnto the reader.
            Among other innumerable pestilent infections of bokes & learnynges / with the which christen people haue bene pyryously seduced and deceyued (brought vp in dyuers kyndes of dyffydence & false hope) I may iudge and that chiefly / those to be pernicyous / on whom they be wont in euery place to pray / and haue also learned by herte / both curyously & with great scrupulosite to make rehersal of theyr sinnes. These bokes (though they aboūded in euery place with infynyte errours / and taught praiers, made with wycked folishnes / both to god and also to his sayntes) yet by cause thei were garnished with gloryous tytles and with redde letters promysyng moch grace and pardon (though it were but vanite) haue sore deceiued the vnlearned multytude / one is called ye gardeyn of the soule / another the paradyse of the soule / & by cause I wyll be short loke thou thy selfe / what dyuerse and glorious names be gyuē vnto them / wherfore here nedeth sherpe reformation / yea and many of them be worthy to be vtterly destroied.

sayntes lyues called legendes for in these are also many thynges added / wherof Sathā is author / how be it syth neither time suffycyent is gyuen to one man / neither ye burthē of this reformation of one may be susteyned. I thought it ynoughe in this place onely to haue monyshed you trustīg that god in tyme commynge shall adde to those thynges bothe tyme conuenyent & also lyght. Therfore here (as entryng my mater) fyrst I wyll declare after a symple & playne maner (by the which euen as by a glasse thou shalt knowe) what ye knowlege of sinne is, and how we ought trulye to pray folowyng the rehersal of the commaundementes and of the Pater noster. And I duobte not but this one prayer is sufficyent ynough to them that pray how often soeuer it be, or what soeuer they requyre, yea yf they take but one lytle parte of it which so euer it be, for a good prayer stondeth not nether cōsysteth in the multytude of wordes as Christe sayeth in the syxte of Mathew. But here stondeth the pythe that thou syghe to god often from the botom of thyn harte, for to haue strenght to do his wyll, to fulfyll his cō
               maundementes, and this syghe ought to endure contynually. Therfore I desyre

al persones that from hensforth they forget suche prayers as be saynte Brigittes and other lyke, whiche greate promyses and perdons haue falsely aduaūced. And you shal retorne vnto this symple prayer nedefull for euery Christen, whose comē vse doeth yet perseuer amonge all men, yf they dyd vnderstonde it, and applyed theyre myndes to it. Suche vertue hathe the Pater noster, that the longer and the more thou vse it, the swetter and more acceptable it is, whiche I desyre that the master of this prayer cōferme Iesus Christe whiche is blessed eternally. So be it.
            IT was neuer ordeyned withoute ye synguler prouidence of god that the multitude of Christen people shuld learne by herte the tenne cōmaundementes, the Crede, and the Pater noster, for truely he that vnderstondeth these hath the pythe of al those thynges, which holy scripture dothe conteyne, and what soeuer may be taught necessary vnto the Christen, and that purely and plentyfully, besydes that so bryefly and clerely that noman can cō
               playne or excuse hym selfe iustly, syth that (whiche is required to the blessed lyfe) is neyther ouertedyous, nor yet so harde but it may be performed. Thre thynges

there be, necessary to be knowen to obteyne eternall lyfe. The fyrste is that thou know what is expedient to be done, and what to be vndon. The secunde when thou perceyuest that thou of thyn owne strenght cannest neyther doo, neyther yet auoide that which thou art bounde to do or to eschewe, that then thou knowe of whome to seke, fynde, and receyue this strenght. The thyrde is howe thou shuldest seke, and obteyne it. And hereunto I wyll gyue the an ensample to thentent yt thou mayst ye more euydently perceyue it, a man which is diseased with any maner of syckenes. Fyrste enquireth with what kynde of sycknes he is infect, & then cōsydereth he what strength he hath, what he is able to do, and what he can not do, thē searcheth he for a medecyne to ley to his dysease, so that by this meanes he may get his helthe & that he may afterwarde be able to do and leaue vndone all thynges as the hole. Fynally, when he hathe founde this medecyne, he wyl take it, and vse it / lykewyse the cōmaundementes of god do teache a man to knowe his infirmite, that he may vnderstonde and fele, what he can do, & what he can not, what he can leaue and what he can not, so that

he maye knowlege hym a vitious person and a synner, after he hath knowleged hym selfe so, that then he may learne by faithe, where to fynde remedy and grace whereby he may be restored and iustified and so may be able to fulfylle the cōmaū
               dementes. For faythe pleynly declareth god and his mercy shewed and gyuen in Christe. But ye Pater noster, dothe teache how we shulde desyre, aske, and obteyne this bountuous fauour, as in a well ordered, meke, and faithfull prayer / whiche getteth all these thynges, so that (fulfyllyng the cōmaundemētes of god) we may be saued & made blessed, wherfore (as I haue saied) in these thre cōsisteth the hole scripture, wherfore it is expedient to begyne at the cōmaundemētes, so that we maye by theym learne to knowlege our synne and malyce (as the spirituall infirmyte) which maketh vs feble and weake so that we can neither do, neither leaue yt which we be bounde to do, or to leaue.
         
         
            ¶The tenne cōmaundementes.
            THe fyrst and most excellent table of Moyses conteyneth thre cōmaundementes, and doth shewe vnto vs what

we owe to god, that is to saye, what we ought to do or eschew concernyng those thyngꝭ whiche specially apperteyne vnto god. Therfore in the fyrst of al the cōmaū
               dementes we be taught what god requireth in euery mans harte, and what man ought to iudge and thynke of hym / that is that he loke euer for the best of hym, euen as of a father, or of a speciall frende and that withoute doubtynge, or any mistrust, with constant faithe, truste, & loue, euer fearynge to dysplease hym, euen as kynde chyldren feare to dysplease theyre natural fathers, for very nature dothe teache that there is one god of whome all our goodnes spryngeth whiche is our socour in all aduersyte, for this thyng euyn the hethen dyd attribute and graūt vnto theyr ydolles.
            
               ¶ The wordes of this cōmaundement ar these. Thou shalt haue no straunge goddes.
               ¶The secounde precept teacheth vs how we ought to ordre our selfe towardꝭ god as consernynge our outewarde workes before men & also inwardly in our owne consciences, whiche is that we honour ye name of god, for noman can shew god as he is in his owne nature, neither to hym

selfe neither yet to any other / but by his only name.
            
            
               ¶The wordes of this commaundement ar these. Thou shalt not take the name of god in vayne.
               ¶The thyrde precept doth shew how we ought to behaue our selfe towardes god in outwarde workes / & in worshyppyng hym.
            
            
               ¶The wordes ar these. Thou shalt kepe holy the saboth day.
               ¶Here mayste thou see howe a man in these thre preceptes is taught / to ordre hym selfe towardes god, in his vnderstondynge, thoughtes of the herte, wordes, & workes, that is to say, thorough oute all his lyfe.
            
            
               ¶The secunde table. THe seconde & last table of Moyses conteyneth seuen preceptes folowyng, & this sheweth vs how we ought to behaue our selues vnto our neighbour, bothe in doynge and euyng vndone.
               ¶The fyrst of these doth teache vs what we be bounde to do to the hygh offycers & suche as be in authorite, ye which seyng that they be set to rule here, in stede of god it is accordynge that this precept be

set next in place after those thre whiche d
                     •
                   perteyne to god hym selfe. The example of this cōmaundement concernynge the personages be, Father, Mother, Lorde, Lady, Master, and Mastres.
            
            
               ¶The wordes ar these. Thou shalt honour thy father & mother.
               ¶In the secunde precept of this table we learne howe we ought to lyue with our equales, and neighbours, and this dothe concerne y• person of man, that we sholde hurte no man. But rather with our labour and diligence, to succurre and promote them whiche is conteyned in these wordes.
            
            
               Thou shalt not kylle.
               ¶ The thyrde passeth thy neyghbours person, and sheweth what thou sholdest do concernynge his chyef possessyons as wyfe, chyldren, and kynsmen, that thou neither defyle nor defame them. But that thou do thy diligence asmoch as lyeth in the to saue theyre honour, and dignite.
            
            
               ¶The wordes ar these. Thou shalt not cōmytte adultery.
               ¶The fourth entreateth of thy neyghbours other mouable goodes teachyng, that thou take nothynge from hym, nor dymynyshe, nor hurte any thyng that he

hath, but rather to proffet, & encreace it.
            
            
               ¶The wordes ar these. Thou shalt not stele.
               ¶In the fyfthe we ar taught howe to ordre our selfe concernyng the name and good fame of our neighbour, neuer to sclaunder hym, but to helpe and defende hym asmoche as lyeth in vs.
            
            
               ¶These ar the wordes of it. Thou shalt bere no false wytnes against thy neyghbour.
               ¶ Therefore it is forboden vs to hurte any kynde of our neigbours goodes. But contrarywyse cōmaunded that we shold encreace them. Nowe yf we loke on the lawe of nature, we shall sone perceyue how meruaillous, equall, good & rightuous these preceptes are, for there is nothynge cōmaunded in all these that apperteyne either to god or to our neyghbour, but that euery man wolde that it shulde be performed towardes hym selfe, yf he were in the stede of god or of his neighbour.
               ¶The two last preceptes do reproue and condemne vs for the wyckidnes and malyce of our nature, & teache vs howe pure we ought to be from all desyryngꝭ of the flesshe and goodes carnall. Here is the

ghostly fyght, the warre, & labour, wherin we ought to be exercysed all our lyfe, which two cōmaundemētes are gyuen in these wordes.
               Thou shalt not desyre thy neyghbours house.
               Thou shalt not desyre thy neyghbours wyfe, seruauntes, maydens, catel, & what soeuer he possesseth.
            
            
               ¶ A shorte conclusyon of the tenne cōmaundementes.
               Christe hym selfe saieth in this maner, what soeuer ye wold that men sholde do to you / the same do you to them. In this is comprehended the lawe & all the Prophettes. Math. vij. There is noman that for his great benefytes loueth to receyue vnkyndnes. There is noman, that wyll gladly suffre his name to be euyll spoken of by another. There is no nomā whiche wyll be cōtente to be despysed of a proude man. Besydes that / there is no man that loueth the dysobedyence, wrathe, or vnchastnes of his wyfe. There is no man which wolde be dyspoyled of his possessions defrauded, deceyued, sclaundered, oppressed. But rather all men are of this nature that they had leuer be fauored, loued kyndely entreated, helped and trusted of

theyr neyghbours, which all are cōmaū
                  ded in these tenne preceptes.
            
            
               ¶Of the transgressyon of the cōmaundementes.
               ¶Agaynst the fyrste precept offende they whiche in aduersyte vse charmes, & wytcraftes, or at any tyme do truste to theyr helpe. They that haue vowed thyr fayth to the deuyll. They which abuse letters, signes, hyrbes, wordes, blessyngꝭ, or such lyke. They that exercyse any other kynde of wytcrafte (as there be many kyndes) some vse roddꝭ, some christal stones, some clothes, & some there be that burne milke some with charmes do dygge vp treasurs. These & all suche other are contrary to the fyrste cōmaundement.
               ¶They that cōferre theyr lyfe & workes to the sygnes of heuen and to the coniecturynge of sothe sayers puttynge obseruation and difference betwyxte tyme and tyme, they that defende either them selfe or theyr catell, house, chyldren, or other goodes from wolues, wepen, fyre, or water, with any prescripte charme, or supersticious prayer. They that ascribe theyr troble & aduersyte, to the deuyll or other euyll men. They that not louyngly and with glad hert, wyll, accepte prosperite &

aduersyte / good and euyl, & all thynges euen as he had receyued them of god / to whome we ought to gyue all thankes what soeuer chaūce vnto vs. They that tempte god without any cause to proue what he wyll do forthem, puttyng themselues in ieoperdy of body or soule. They that wax proude of ryghtwysnes, cūnyng or other spirituall gyfte. They that worshype god or his sayntes, for temporall goodes only or chyfly, forgettyng the prophetes of theyr soules. They that truste not euery tyme & in euery place puttynge theyr cōfydence onely in the mercy of god thrugh oute all theyr lyues and werkes. They that doubte in fayth of the fauour of god. They that regarde not ye vnbelefe and mystruste of other neyther bryngeth them to theyr poore to beleue and trust in the mercy of god. Of this place are all kyndes of vnbelefe, mistrust & desperation.
               ¶Agaynst the secunde offendeth he that without a cause or of a custume sweryth folyshely / he that forswereth hym selfe / or kepeth not his promesse / he that swereth or voweth to do any myschief / he that by the name of god doth curse or bāne / other he that folyshely tryfleth with god, wresteth (though it be in sport) the wordes of

scripture. He that in troble dothe not call on the name of god, neither thāketh hym in all thynges, swete, sower, good & euyll welfare and troble / he that seketh to be praysed and honoured for his vertue and wysdome. He that falsely doth cal on the name of god, as heretykes do, and which by pryde haue fayned them selues holy / he that prayseth not the name of god in all thynges that chaunce vnto hym. He that withstondeth not all suche thynges as do sclaunder the name of god, and they that mysuse his holy name, or by thoccasyon of it do euyll dedes / adde herunto vayne glory, honour, and pryde of spirituall thynges.

And moche more they whiche curse, banne, and beate them, whiche say euyll by them, sclaunder them, hate and disobey them. He that in his hert settyth not moche by them for goddes cōmaundemētes. He that doth not honour them though they be cruell and vnryghtfull. He that obeyeth not to masters and officers / is not trusty and faythfull to them whether they be good or euyll. He that maynteyneth not this cōmaundement / nor resysteth not them whiche do the contrary / hyther conferre all the kyndes of pryde of disobedyence.
               ¶Agaynst the fyfte, offendeth he that is angry with his neighbour. He that saith vnto his neyghbour Racha, in whiche worde ar conteyned all kyndes of wrath and hatred. He that called an other fole, of which worde spryng chekkes, rebukes cursynges, sclanderynges, iudgementes, mockers and suche other. He that dothe publyshe his neighbours offences, & doth not couer and excuse them. He that forgyueth not his enemyes. He that prayeth not for his enemyes. He yt wyll not loue

and do his duety to his enemy. Under this precept are conteyned all the synnes of wrath, hatred, manslaughter, bataylle pylage, burnynges, fynally of contention stryfe, chydinges, enuy in the welfare of our neyghbours, & reioysyng of his hurte or troble. He that dothe not exercyse the workꝭ of mercy, & that vnto his enemies. He that setteth other by the eares, and entyseth them to hate the one the other. He that styrreth vp dyscorde amonges other. He that doth not reconcyle them, whiche be at defyaūce. He that withstondeth not nor preuenteth wrathe, and debate, yf he may.

And that he yt kepeth the cōmaundemētes fulfylleth nothyng but loue, agayne nothyng but loue breketh the cōmaundementes.

               ¶The fulfyllynge of the cōmaundementes.
               THe fulfyllynge of the fyrste cōmaundement is feare, and loue towardes god, with an vnfayned faythe to trust constantly vnto god in all thynges / to betake ourselue pleynly & purely vnto god in all poyntes to mystrust and denye our selfe vtterly in all thynges whether they be good or bad / here put in what so euer is wryten in the holy scrypture, of fayth, hope, and loue towardes god whiche are shortly conteyned in this fyrste precept.
               ¶The fulfyllynge of the secounde is. To prayse, to honour, to blysse, and call on the name of god, vtterly to despyse, and forsake our owne name and glory / so that god only haue the prayse, whiche alone worketh all thynges / here taketh place what thynge soeuer is wryten in holy scrypture of the prayse of god / of gyuyng thankes to hym, of the name of god, of ioye & gladnes
               ¶The fulfyllynge of the thyrde is / to betake our selfe hooly to god / that he alone may worke in vs, and do all thynges.
               This cōmaundemēt requireth pouerty of spirite, which shulde offre hym selfe to god as deade and not lyuynge in this worlde, that he may be his god / whiche on hym

selfe may take both his name and worke, accordynge to the meanynge of the two forsayd cōmaundementes; herunto apperteyneth what so euer is cōmaunded vnto vs of worshyppynge god, of hearyng goddes worde / of good workes, by whiche we may subdue the fleshe to the spyryte, soo yt all our lyfe, and all our workes be goddes and not our owne.
               ¶ The fulfyllynge of the fourth is, with full obedyence, and mekenes to submytte hym selfe to all offycers, because it pleaseth god (as wryteth Thapostle Peter) without cōtradyction, without compleynt, and without any grudgynge, herunto applye what so euer thynges are wryten in scrypture of obedyence, humylyte, subiectyon, and reuerence.
               ¶The fulfyllynge of the fyueth is / sufferaunce, mekenes, goodnes, peace, mercy, an herte that is full puryfyed with loue, and swetenes, clene without hate, wrathe and bytternes not to his frendꝭ only / but also to his enemyes / yea & indyfferently to all men / hyther conferre all the instructions of pacyence / gentelnes / peace / and vnyte.
               ¶The fulfyllynge of the syxte is chastyte / sobrenes / shamefastnes / not of dedes only but of wordꝭ & maners / yea & of thoughtꝭ.

Besydes that attēperaunce, of meate / drynke / slepe / and what so euer doth helpe ch

               ¶The fulfyllyng of the seuenth is pouerty of spirite / kyndenes / liberalyte spēdyng of our owne goodes to proffet our neyghbours / to lyue without couetousnes / and desyre of ryches / here gather all yt is wrytē of couetousnes / of goodes iniustly goten & possessed / of vsury / sotelty / euyll deceypte / of iniury, and hurte done / of lettynge thy neyghbours proffet, or despysyng hym.
               ¶The fulfyllynge of the eyght is a peasyble, and hole tonge, which hurteth nomā / but profyteth all men / whiche setteth enemyes at one / whiche excuseth & defendeth them that be noted vicyous persones and synners. Such symplicite and proffet is in speakynge / herunto apperteyne al thyngꝭ which ar spoken of sylence and speakynge and what so euer toucheth / ye good name / honour / ryght causes / and proffettes of thy neighbour.
               ¶ The fulfyllyng of the last is the perfect and absolute purenes and despysyng (in ye
                  
harte) of all temporall ryches & pleasures which thyng shall be done perfectly in the lyfe to come.
               In all these thynges seest thou non other thynge but to loue other, that is loue god and thy neyghbour, which loue seketh not dis owne profet / but only those thynges whiche belonge to god, and to his neyghbour which loue yeldeth and gyueth hym selfe pleynly to euery man, grauntyng the ryght gladly in thyr necessyte the moderat vse of all his goodes and proffettes. Now seyst thou that in all these tenne cōmaundementes in a good ordre, and bryefly are cōteyned all kyndes of informations, that are expedyent for mans lyfe, which yf any man wyll do his diligence to kepe truely / he shal neuer be ydle, no not an houre, but shall haue occasion to do good dedes, so yt truely he shall neuer haue nede to chose to hym other straung workes of mans inuē
                  tion neyther to be occupyed in suche thynges, as in no place ar cōmaunded & which be no thynge profyttable, neyther to hym selfe nor to his neyghbour. It is euident yt in al these preceptes there is nothyng wryten, which teacheth vs to serue our selues, eyther to do, leue, or require of any man / that whiche consernyth our owne proffet,

but only what we are bounde to do to other (that is to say) to god & to our neyghbour. So that euen blynde men may well perceyue that the fulfyllynge of the commaundementes stondeth in loue towardꝭ other, not towardes our selfe. For man of his owne nature seketh and auoydeth sufficiently / that which is for (or agaynste) his proffet / so that it nedeth not to moue hym to it / but moch rather to brynge hym from it. Therfore he lyueth beste whiche lyueth not to hym selfe. And contrary he lyueth worste which lyueth to hym selfe. This is theffect that the tenne cōmaundementes teache, wherby it is manifest that there be but few that lyue well, ye: in that we are men / none of vs lyueth well. This knowē we must learne of whome to aske this excellent gyfte, to lyue well, so that we may fulfyll these cōmaundementes.
            
         
         
            ¶ The Crede or Belefe.
            
               THeffect of our Faythe stondeth in thre partes, as in it are rehersed thre persones of the godly Trinite. The fyrst is of the father. The seconde of the Sonne. The thyrde of the holy ghoste / and to euery one of these persones is applyed his operation.
            
               This is the chyef Article of the fayth, on y• whiche all the other depende.
            ¶ Here note two maner of beleues, fyrst some there be whiche beleue / that those thynges be true whiche are spoken of god euen as a man doth beleue those thynges to be true whiche he hereth of the Turke / of the deuyll / and of hell. This faythe is rather a scyence / or a vayne opynyon then a sure truste / or belefe. There is an other fayth towardes god / that thou do not only beleue these thynges to be true, whiche thou hearest of god / but also trust to hym and betake / and cōmyt thy selfe hooly vnto hym / besydes that / to haue a sure hope and confydence in hym with the maner of a certayn good presumptyon vpon hym yt without doubte thou surely shalt opteyne and receyue of hym / that which thou hardest spoken of hym / and that with suche fayth and cōfydence as thou woldest gyue to no erthly mā. Beyt in case yt the Turke (or any other mā) be greatly praysed vnto the / and that thou beleue faythfully / that some man is dyscrete / and worthy prayse / yet for all that thou wyll not cōmytte thy selfe vnto hym / puttynge all thy trust and confydence in hym. But this faythe which boldely betaketh hym selfe to god / both in

ieopardy of lyfe and death / knowlegynge that he is suche as he is spoken of maketh only a Christen / & obteyneth of god what so euer she desyreth / neyther is there any false harte that receyueth this faythe / for this is the quyck fayth whiche is requyred in the fyrst cōmaundement whiche sayeth thus: I am thy god / take no straūge goddes / wherfore this In / is not put in vayne but it is to be obserued with a notable sygnyfycatyon. For we do not say / I beleue to god the father or of god the father. But I bleue in god the father / in Iesu Christe: and in the holy ghost / wherfore this fayth ought to be had in none but in one god / so that by this we cōfesse also the godhed of Chryste and of the holy ghost / because we beleue none other wyse in the sonne / & the holy ghoste then we do in the father hym selfe, For euen as we haue one fayth in all thre persones / so all thre persones are only one god.
            
               ¶The fyrste parte of the Belefe.
               I Beleue in God the father almyghty maker of Heuen and Erthe. That is I forsake satan & al Idolatry / al charmes wytchecraftes / and false hope / I put my trust in noman of all the worlde / neyther

yet in my selfe, not in my power, lernynge scyence, ryches, wysdome, or what thynge soeuer it be, that I haue or possesse I put no confydence in any creature, whether it be in Heuen, or in Erthe. But I put my sure trust in only in one God whiche can not be seen with mans iye, whiche can not be comprehended with mans wytte, whiche made Heuen and Erthe, and alone ruleth all creatures. To hym hooly I submytte any selfe / nothyng fearyng, nor regardyng the malyce of the deuyll, and his felowes, for my god is aboue thē all. Neyter wolde I put the lesse confidence in god, thoughe all men dyd forsake me and persecute me. Neyther wyll I truste hym the lesse, because I am wretched and poore / because I am rude, and vnlearned, because I am despysed and lack possessyons. Nother yet the lesse because I am a synner for this my fayth doth farre passe all thynges (as it is necessary and oughte to do) what so euer eyther be, or be not, bothe synnes and vertues, and to be shorte, al thynges. So that she doth puerely and hooly fyxe her self in god only, as the fyrste cōmaundement teacheth and compelleth me. Neyther I desyre any signe to tempte hym, I trust faythfully vnto hym, although he differre, and

tary at his pleasure I wyll not set or prescrybe to hym any ende, any tyme, measure or reason / but I cōmytte all to his wyll / with a pure fayth and a stable, for he is almyghty, what can I lacke that he can not gyue and do vnto me? For he is the maker of Heuē & Erthe, & lord of al thyngꝭ what thynge can hyndre me or hurt me? Howe may it be yt al thingꝭ shal not turne to myn vse & proffet / when he to whome all these thyngꝭ are subyect and obedient, fauoreth me and loueth me? Nowe (syth he is god) he knoweth wherunto he hathe ordeyned me, and how euery thynge shal be best for me and that whiche he knoweth / he may do, and seyng he is my father, it is sure that he wyll see the best for me, and that for the fatherly loue that he hath vnto me. When I doubte not hereof and haue such trust in hym, then no doubte I am his seruaūt, his Sonne, and his heyre for euer. And euen as I beleue so shall it be vnto me.
            
            
               ¶ The secounde parte of the belefe.
               And in Iesu Chryste, his only sonne our lorde / which was cōceyued by ye holy ghost Borne of Mary the virgyne suffred vndre Pontius Pilatus, crucified, deed, & buried,

descēded to hel, the thyrde day rose agayne from death. Ascended to heuen / syttyth on the ryght hāde of god the father almyghty from thense he shall come to iudge quycke and deade.
               ¶That is I do not only beleue / that Iesu Christe is the true / & only sonne of god / by euerlastinge and godly nature, and beynge from the begynnyng & euer begoten: but also that all thyngꝭ are subdued vndre hym / and that he is my lorde / and the lorde of al creatures / made ruler of them beyng man / whiche he hym selfe with the father in his diuinyte dyd make.
               ¶ I beleue that nomā may beleue in god the father / or may come vnto the father / neyther by science and learnynge / neyther by workes / neyther by theyr owne reason and wytte / or by what thyng so euer may be named in Heuen or Erth. But by this and in this Iesu Christe his only sonne, that is to say, by the fayth / in the name, and power of Iesu Christ. I beleue vnfaynedly / and surely / that he was conceyued for my profet by the holy ghoste, without all mans carnall worke / without a bodely father, or mannes sede / and that to puryfy and make spiritual my fynful, flesshly / vnclene / and damnable conceptyon, and all

theyrs that beleue in hym, moued to this mercy of his owne and fre wyll & the wyll of the almyghty father.
               ¶ I beleue that he was begotten, of the virgyne Mary without ye losse of her pure and incorrupte virginite, so yt (accordynge to the prouidence of the mercyfull father) he sholde blysse and clense the synnes and damnable byrth of all that beleue in hym / that after it myght do no hurte.
               ¶I beleue that he suffred passion & death for my synnes, and all theyrs that beleue in hym / and that he therby blyssed all passyons / crosses & deathes, so that after they might not hurte, but be both holsome and merytoryous.
               ¶ I beleue that he was dede and buryed, to mortyfy and bury my synne, all synnes of them that beleue. Fynally that all bodely death by his death was destroyed / so yt it is no power to hurte, but is rather made holsome and profytable.
               ¶I beleue that he went downe to hell to subdue and make captyue / to me and to al that beleue / the deuyll with al his impery subtilete and malyce / to delyuer me from hell, wherunto I was condemned / in my fyrste father Adam / takynge awey all his power that he myght not hurte me. But

sholde rather as by occasion be proffytable vnto me.
               ¶ I beleue that in the thyrde day he rose agayne from deth / to brynge me & all that beleue into a newe lyfe, & that by this dede he raysed me with hym in grace and spirit not to synne after / but yt I endowed with all kyndes of grace and vertue, myght serue hym & so fulfylle his cōmaundementes.
               ¶I beleue that he ascended into Heuen & that he hath receyued of the Father rule / and honour aboue al Aungellꝭ & creatures And that he now sytteth on the ryght hād of the Father that is, that he is kynge and lorde ouer all the goodes of his Father in Heuen, Hel, and Earth / wherfore he may helpe me and them that beleue / in all maner of aduersytes, agaynst all our aduersaryes and enemyes.
               ¶I beleue that from thense he shall returne the laste day, to iudge quycke, whome he then shal fynde alyue, and deade which before were buryed. And that he shall cause al men & aungelles good & euyl to come before the seate of his iudgement (whome they shall se bodely) to delyuer me and all faythfull, from bodely death from all euyll and synnes. And to punyshe with eternall iudgement his enemyes and aduersaryes,

so yt we shall be delyuered frō theyr power for euer.
            
            
               ¶The .iij. parte of the belefe.

               ¶ That is to say / I do not only beleue yt the holy ghost is very god, with the father and the sonne. But also that noman can come to the father by Christe, by his lyfe / passion, death & what so euer was spoken of Christ or opteyne any of these thynges, without ye worke of this spirite, with the whiche spirite I desyre the father, and the sonne, to touche me & all faythful to sturre me vp / to call, to drawe, and by Christ & in Christe to quycken me, to make me holy & spirituall, & so to brynge me to the Father, for it is he, which with ye father, by Christe & ī Christ worketh & quickeneth al thyngꝭ.
               ¶I beleue yt in al the world, be it neuer so greate, there is but one comē Christē churche, which is none other thing but ye cōgregatiō & cōmunyō of holy men, yt is of rightuous & faythfull men on ye earth / & yt this churche by this holy spirit is gadered, and maynteyneth / thorough whome also it is gouerned & encreased / dayly by the sacramentes and worde of god.

And yt none of the Iewes, or Gentilꝭ can be saued with this church, except they reconcyle them selfe vnto it, & come in fauour with it / conformyng them selues in all pointes therunto.
               ¶I beleue that in this cōmunyon, or christente all the prayers / and goode workes of this congregation do necessaryly helpe me, weigh on my syde and conforte me in all tymes of lyfe and deathe.
               ¶I beleue that in this congregation and comen welth (and in none other place) is forgyuenes of synnes. And that without this, all great & good workes / how many soeuer there be of them do nothyng profet to forgyuenes of synne. And contrarywyse in this cōgregation / the multitude / greatnes, and often cōmytting of synnes / do no thynge hurte / nether let the forgyuenes of synne. But that this forgyuenes doeth cotynue whersoeuer and how longe / this excellent churche doth endure. To whome also Christ gyueth his keys / & sayth Mat. 18. What so euer ye lose vpon Erth / it shal be losed in Heuē. Lykewyse Math. 16. he

sayth to Peter alone. In the name & stede of this only church / what so euer thou lose vpon Earth it shall be losed in heuen.
               ¶I beleue that there shall be a rysynge of them that are deade / in the whiche rysyng the holy ghost shal sturre vp al flesshe, that is all men concernyng the body and flesshe good and euyll, so yt the veray flesshe whiche was deade buried and consumed or by other wayes destroyed shall returne, and lyue agayne.

                be ascrybed to our owne worthynes / yf we do obteyne any thynge of god / but it is to be ascribed to ye infinit goodnes of god / which

hathe longe before preuēted our petitions and prayers, with his promyse and cōmaū
               dement / wherby he dothe excite and styrre vs to praye that at the leaste wyse by the reason hereof / we may learne yt he is farre more careful for vs, and more redy to gyue or graūte / then we be eyther to receyue or els to aske. And for as moche as he dothe offre more benefytes & good thynges vnto vs / then we our selues durste haue ben bolde to wysshe or desyre / that lyberalyte & bountuousnes of god oughte to enflame and to encourage vs for to praye boldelye without ony mystruste or doubtefullnes.
            ¶Secūdarily / this thyng also (as I haue saide) is requisite to a true orison or prayer that we do not doubte any thynge of the promyse of god whiche is bothe true and faythefull. For this cause pryncypally he promysed, that he shall here our prayer, & gaue vs cōmaundement to pray / that we shulde be assured & beleue stedfastly, that he wyll certeynly here vs and graunte our petition, as he sayeth in the .xxi. chapitre of Mathewe, where it is red in this wyse, I say vnto you, what so euer thinges you do aske or desyre, when you do pray / beleue yt you shall receyue them, and they shall be graunted vnto you. And in the .xi. of Luke

aske and it shal be gyuen to you / seke and you shall fynde / knocke and it shall be opened to you, for euery man ye asketh receyueth / and who so euer seketh fyndeth, and to hym that knocketh / it shall be opened, who is he amonge you beynge a father, of whome yf his son shall desyre breade wyll gyue hym a stone? Or yf he desyre fysshe, wyll gyue hym a serpent / in the stede of a fy

               s
                  •
               e? Or yf he shall aske an egge, wyll reache to hym ascorpion? yf you then whē ye are euyll can gyue good gyftes to your sonnes, how moche more shall your heuenly father gyue the holy ghost to them that desyre hym? By these & by lyke promyses and preceptes, our mynde is to be confyrmed and strēghthed that we may pray boldely and with confidence, beynge assured and out of doubte yt we shall receyue & obteyn al thyngꝭ which we do aske or desyre.
            ¶Thyrdly yf men vndyscretely doubte of god, when they pray, whether that thyng shall come to passe, whiche they desyre or not, they do cōmytte two offences or synnes. Fyrst, because thorough theyr defaute it chaūseth & cometh to passe yt their praier is of no strenghte, and is cause that they labour in wayne, for so also saynte Iames sayeth. yf any man asketh any thynge of

god let hym aske with good truste, & with out any doubtfulnes, for he that doubteh / is lyke to the waue of the see, which is dryuen with the wyndes, and caryed with vyolence. And let not that man thynke that he shall receyue any thynge of god, which wordes of saynt Iames do playnly declare that all they whiche in thyr prayers doubt to be harde. shall obteyne nothyng of god / because theyr hertes are not assured, and quiet or at rest. But fayth kepeth the herte in quietnes and rest, that it may receyue & take the gyftes of god. The secoūde thyng wherin they do offende and synne, who so euer prayeth without faythe and truste is this, because they do not gyue credence to god, whiche is faythfull & true of promyse but distrusteth hym, as yf he ware a lyar. or a tryflyng lyght man, & as though god eyther colde not or els wolde not performe his promyses. And suche persones taken away from almyghty god his honour and name, for that they do not beleue, that he is faythful and true, and this is so greate a synne that it maketh of a Christen man an infidele, and not only by this synne god is denyed, but also is forgone & loste, neyther is there any hope of helthe and saluation, so longe as we shal cōtynue in this synne.

And yf it do happen or chaunce, otherwh
                  •
               
               les, that they do obteyne any thynge whiche do praye thus without confidence and truste, that gyfte is geuen to them of god beyng displeased and angry with them to the hurte and vndoyng both of theyr body and soule, that at the leaste wyse some honour may be had / or gyuen to ye holy wordes, whiche are spoken and pronounced of men beynge full of synne, infidelyte, & contempte or despisinge of God.
            ¶Fourthly / neyther they also are of right opynyon: whiche suppose or wene yt theyr selues may not obteyn any thyng by praier, but yf they come worthely to praye / for this is not to be consydered whether thou be worthy or vnworthy, which doest pray / for yf we sholde not pray before such tyme that we sholde thynke our selfe worthy / apte or mete, then coulde we neuer praye & for (as we haue taughte here tofore) our prayer is not grounded, neyther trusteth vpon the worthynes, whiche we do bryng with vs: but vpon the stedfast & sure truth of godes promesse / and verely yf prayer do trust eyther in it selfe or elles in any other thyng saue onely in goddes promesse it is vayne and without frute, euen though it seme to procede of a deuout affection of the

herte and mynde / and also though ye eyes in wepynge shede forthe teares or droppes not of water but of bloude. But therfore we do praye be cause we can not pray worthely, and therfore we be iudged worthy to praye, and to be harde because we do fele and perceyue our owne vnworthynes, & are bolde only vpon the truste of the bountyfull goodnes, and also the faythfulnes of god, how muche so euer vnworthy thou felest and iudgest thy selfe to be, eyther to aske & desyre, or els to receyue any thynge of god, yet consydre thou this thynge only that thou must honour his name, because he is true, and that thyn infidelyte & vnbeleue do not repute and reken his faythfull promyses / for a lye or leasynge, for thyne owne vntworthynes doth nothynge hyndre or let the. Lykewyse as it doth nothynge promote or further the / yf thou be worthy, but only incredulyte and lack of fayth cōdempneth the, & fayth maketh the worthy & also saueth the, herof therefore thou shalt dilgiently take hede and beware that thou neuer thynke, or iudge thy selfe worthy, eyther to make petition or prayer, or els to receyue & obteyne that whiche thou desyrest, except only then when thou thynkest that thou mayste safely / and surely be

bolde to truste, to the assured & true promises of thy mercyfull god, of whose mercy thou oughtest to be so moche the more certeyne & assured for yt, lykewyse as he hathe made this promyse to yt beynge vnworthy and nothynge deseruynge it, that he wyll denye nothyng vnto yt: euē so also be thou neuer so moch vnworthy, yet wyll he here th
                  •
               , and graunte the thy petycyon for to fulfyll his promyse, whiche he hath made vnto the. So then nothyng at all is lefte, whiche may be ascrybed to our merites or worthynes / but all together is of ryght to be ascrybed, pertly to the trouthe of god, wherby he performeth his promyse, and partly to the mercye of god out of whiche (as of a founteyne) all yt promyses sprang forthe / that the sentence maye be verefyed whiche is in. the .xxv. psalme / all ye wayes of the lorde, is mercy, and trouthe, for his mercy we do se and beholde: in these promyses makynge / and his trouthe we do se then when the sayde promyses are kepte and performed and in the .lxxxv. psalme. Mercy and trouthe hath mette together / that is to saye, cometh together, and are sene ioyned the one with yt other, in euery worke or gyfte of god.

                  〈◊〉
               
               
do gyue credēce to the promyses of god, is so to be tempered and ordered, that we do not set or appointe to god any terme, time place, or forme, and maner. But let vs leaue all those thynges to his wyll, his wysdome, and almyghty power, beynge assured and out of doubte, that those thynges shall come to passe and be done, which we do aske and desyre, al be it that neither the place, neither the tyme, neither yet ye way / and maner by whiche it may be done, doth appere vnto vs, for this is sure & vndoubted, that the wisdome of god knoweth and foreseeth these thyngꝭ farre better then we Therfore yf thou gyue credēce to god, and dost referre and put al thynges to his wyl and pleasure those thynges shall vndoubtedly be done and brought to passe, which thou desyrest, at the leaste wyse by myracles, yf there be none other way wherby they may be done, wherof we haue an ensample in the people of Israhell, whiche when they had gyuen credence to god, and put theyr truste in hym, that he wolde delyuer them from theyr ennemye, & yet not withstondynge there appered no maner way wherby it myght be don and brought to passe sodenly the red see opened it selfe, and gaue them way / wherby they myghte

and dyd passe thorough. And it dyd ouerwhelme / and drowne theyr enmyes euery mothers sonne. In lyke maner Iudyth ye holy woman, when she had vnderstondynge and knowlege that the Citezens of Bethulia had taken this counsayll, and purpose, that they wolde yelde vp the citye to theyr enemyes, except god wolde help thē with ī .v. daies, she rebuked them very sore and saide / what maner of men be you whiche do tempte the lorde in this wyse. This is not the speche, which may prouoke mercy, but rather which may prouoke, & styrre vp wrathe and kendle ire, haue you set the tyme of the lordes mercy, and haue you appoynted hym a day for your wyll and pleasure? therfore god by a meruaylous way & maner delyuered her so that she dyd cut of Olophernus hed, and so draue backe the hoste or armye from the cyty as it is red in the .xviij. chapitre of Iudith. So lykewyse Paule sayeth in the thyrde chapitre to the Ephesians. That this is the maner & custume of god to do all thynges farre after another maner, and muche better then we can either desire, or els vnderstonde & perceyue. Thus then let vs thynke and iudge that we our selues are farre more vile and vnworthy / then that we may appoynte or

prescribe to god in our prayer, either the tyme, or the place, or the forme and maner or any other circumstaunce. But let vs leaue all thynges to his godly wyll and pleasure. And let vs beleue fyrmely and stedfastly / that it shal vndoubtedly come to passe that he shall here vs, and graunte vs our petition and desyre.

               ¶ The fyrste parte of the passyon of our sauyour Chryste contaynynge the cōmunycacyon of Chryste with his dsicyples nowe goynge forth to the Mounte Olyuete.
               
                  WHen Iesus hadde made an ende of his sermon, he went forth with his disciplꝭ ouer a broke called Cedrō. Iohn̄ into the mounte Olyuete, vnto the wich place he was wont oft before to go to praye, but nowe (his passion drawinge nyghe) he wente to praye more feruently & more effectuously & that in ye nyght. Mathew / Marke / Luke. And as he was goynge, for that his disciples had herde theyr master oft before sayenge that he sholde departe frō them, they began to dyspute amonge them selfe, whiche of them sholde be hygheste to succede theyr mayster in lyke authorite, for as yet they knewe not to what office they were called. And whan theyr ambicion begā to breke forth in to suche maner of contencyouse reasonynge, theyr master Christe (as he dyd sumtymes before) cōmaunded them to silence sayeng. The heathē kyngꝭ beare

a rule and playe the lordes amonge them selues, and such as so rule are called great men of authorite and powre / but ye shall not be so, for he yt is greatest amonge you, shall be as the loweste, and he that is chefe shal be as a seruant, for whether is he greater that sitteth downe to be serued, or he yt seruyth hym? is not he that sytteth? I my selfe am here amonge you as one that mynystreth, ye are they which haue abydē by me in my temptacions. And I laye out for you the same kyngdome whiche my father layed out for me, that ye shulde eate & drynke at my table in my kyngdome, & syt in iugdment iugdynge the twelfe tribes of Israell (for ye are those chyldren of whom it is prophecied in the .xlv. psalme / to come in the steade of the fathers, to teache ye people, whom they shall take as princes in all the Erthe) but not with stondyng I haue thus promoted you to suche an hyghe dygnyte of the whiche I haue soo ofte spoken vnto you, yet this same nyghte shall ye all be sore offended, and hurte by me / of the whiche hurte I haue so ofte warned you before / for verelye ye shall fle awaye from me as thoughe ye had neuer sene any touche or token of God in me / but thus pleaseth it my father to handle you / thus shall

ye haue experiēce how litel power ye haue to goodnes, except ye haue it of me / also it behoueth me to suffre such afflyction of all maner of men, euen of me fryndes and famylyare which haue apoynted my selfe to be offred in sacrifice vnto my father, for the helth of as many as shal be saued. This is the same thyng that the prophete zacharie prophesied on me sayng. The hearde man shall be smyten, and the shepe asktered abrode / but yet for this your fall, se that ye shrynke not away nor dispayre / for I wyll lyft you vp agayne. And when I shall be vp rysen, I shall gather you agayne togyder in Galilie, and I shal go before you as it becommeth the hearde man to go before his shepe / offerynge my selfe agayne vnto you as a guyde / a leader / & defender. Math. Marke / Luke.

But I my selfe haue prayede for you all, as ye well knowe, but especyallye for the Simon, whiche shalte fall more perelously and more greuouslye then other lest thy fayth faille, which thou

Unto whiche thynges Peter answered / I am redy sayed he (maister) to go in to prisone with the ye to go in to deth with the. Luke. wherfore yf all other beynge hurte by the reason of thy perell, fayle the, yet shal I abyde styl by the (here he felte how ernestly he shulde haue loued his maister) but he knew it not to be the gyfte of the father, so to loue him & not to cōme of flesshe and blode / which thyng his master ons testefied vnto hym after his solēpne & heuenly cōfession) & vpon this, his mayster sayde especially vnto hym that he shulde denye hym thryse / saynge, Peter, verely I saye vnto the: this same nyght / euen thou shalt denye me thryse / before ye kocke shall haue crowen twyse, and Peter then trustynge ouer moche to hym selfe, spoke with a bolder affirmation saing, yf I shulde dye with the / yet shal I not denye the, which thyng also sayed the other. Math. Mar. Luke. For as yet they were without any perell.

This is it writen / Esaye the .liij. chapytre. I shall be reputed amonge the wycked & shall be haryed and tugged to death lyke an aduersary to god. But at last this busynes for the which the father hath apoynted me to dye ī so poore a carefull and shamfull state shall haue an ende: but his dyscyples (as yet nothynge mystrustyng theyr owne strenghtes, suposyng

to haue auoyded the perel by swerde) spoke both loude and boldely. Syr / lo: here are two swerdes, thynke ye not these two be sufficient for this seyrme? ye (sayde theyr mayster scornynge them, they are inoughe thinkyng it no neade to brynge them in to any farther daunger, whom he knewe to fyghte with theyr feete, rather than with swerde (for yf theyr enemies had espied thē armed with any weapen to resyste, they wolde haue bene more fearse vpon them) also the tyme was cōme, yt he wolde gyue hym selfe wyllyngly to dye, not withstandynge yet Peter kepte one of the swerdes for the glory of god, but vnwares. Luke.

                  thynge of ye body, yf the mynde feale it not? when he was in this paynfull affliction of mynde, so that he was nyghe deade (for he was heuy euen into deathe) he fled vnto his father, as it was his maner, and is the maner also of all sayntes, whom because he wolde call in to his helpe more ernestly and with more fre spirite at his pleasure, he wente furthe a lytell farther from these thre disciples (although he loued thē dearly) he went from them as ye wolde saye a stones cast, & ther he fell downe flat vpon therthe and prayed, sayeng / Father yf it be possible, beare ouer this passion from me, neuertheles not my wyl, but thyn be done

(for he made rather his complayte here be fore his father, then desyred his passion to be turned from hym) for he cam in to this honour wel wyllyng / but with how heuy and tremblyng mynde (for that his deathe was now at hand) no man maye expresse / here he shewed his father his feruent desyre to death and how presently his nature felt it, wherfore it was shewed hym thus to be his fathers pleasure, and so was he well counforted.
               ¶When he had thus prayed, that is to say when he had thus poured furth the feruēt desyres of his herte (thus wounded with horroure and feare euen into deathe) into his fathers bosome, & that doubtlesse with many a deape syghe, with sore sobbynge & feruent thoughtes, and thus, he stedfastlye consyderynge his fathers wyll on this maner to require of hym the helth of ye worlde he toke curage and herte vnto hym selfe & turned to his disciples, lyke as that man whose mynde is greuously vexed and trobled can not abyde longe in one place.
               And whan he cam he founde thē all a slepe where (because Peter had answered hym more boldly than other) he chalenged him fyrste, by name sayenge Simon, not one houre mayste thou not watche with me?

wher is now I praye the, that bolde spryted herte of thyne, that was so redy to go with me euen in to deth? Awake, awake, & fal to prayer least ye fal in to that greuous temptacion, whiche hangeth nowe ouer your headꝭ, as your spirites wer then al to bolde, so is you flesshe now all to weake to endure longe, ye shulde haue rather prayed then slepte, yf ye had ben wyse. But so it behoued them to be tought by theyr owne foly / not only how feable is theyr flesshe / but also howe vnable it is all to gyder to any goodnes / and that al strenght cōmeth of god / not withstondynge at this tyme toke they full lytel heade to theyr maisters rebuke & chalenge. Then turned he agayn to prayer when he se that in his most deare chosen and trusty there was no counforte whiche thynge verely moch more encresed his heuenes, for so it behoued hym to suffre affliction on euery syde.
               ¶ He prayed agayn the same prayer that he dyd before, that is to saye, he layed the troble of his mynde in the wyll of his Father desyrynge his consolation, and from thense agayne he wente vnto his disciples whom he founde, lykewyse a slepe as before, for they coulde not holde vp theyr iyes neither they thus blamed myght aūswere

theyr mayster any thynge at all. Thus agayne receyued he affliction and heuynes of them, of whom he shulde haue had consolation and counforte. The thyrde tyme lykewyse he gaue hym selfe to prayer / and prayed somwhat lenger, for he was all to tormented and in suche an agony that his swet ran done with blody dropes in to the erth. And thus when his agony and heuynes of mynde wer greater then he myghte any lenger suffer / there appered an angell vnto hym & conforted hym settyng doubtles before his minde effectuously that meruelous ryche sauyng helth which he shold perfourme and finyshe by his passyon / and also the glorye of his father whiche therof sholde be greatly set forthe & sprede a brode: so that this cōsolation receyued, he rose vp and returned hym vnto his disciples. And when they were yet a sleape he sayde vnto theym after a scornfull maner thus: sleape now and take your rest, as who shold say, is there suche tranquilite & peace towarde vs that ye maye sleape so surely withoute feare? Oh how insensyble are ye and lyke stones nothyng fealyng or perceyuyng all these thynges which I tolde you before as cōcernynge this stormy tempest euen now at hande? Aryse, Aryse, ons, for ye haue

               AFter this, whan the iewes thought them selfe well and sufficiciently instructe to accuse Christe. The multitude rose vp from the councell & presented hym vnto Pilate / Luke. For they wolde not entre in to theyr towne house, or iudgement hall leste they shulde haue polluted theyr selues: for this holy hipocrites & false phariseis shulde celebrate and keape holy their passe ouer daye on the morowe: here may ye se how scrupulouse was theyr vngodly holynes / wherfore Pilate wente forthe vnto them askynge theym wherfore they accused this man / and they answered / yf he were not a malefactor we had not in any wyse delyuerd hym vnto yt, with ye whiche

answere so proudlye spoken Pilate was somwhat offended and bad them procede with hym as they had begonne, & to iudge hym after theyr owne lawes / and they denyed that it was lawfull for them to slaye any man. And thus was it ordeined of god that Christe shulde be crucified of the Gentilles as he ofte tymes before tolde it vnto his disciples / Iohan. Then beganne they to accuse Christe agayne that he had made sedicions among ye people thorugh his doctrine whiche they were aboute to make appere dampnable & sediciouse saieng that he forbodde tribute to be gyuen to Themperour, and at last they sayde that Christe made hym selfe a kynge, by which sayengꝭ they trusted to condempne him of treason / Luke. wherfore Pilate the iudge asked hym now standynge before hym, whether he were the kynge of Iewes? for this mater, he thought perteyned vnto his charge which was then there deputed to gouerne vnder Themperour. But as touchyng his doctrine (as a thynge nothyng derogating Themperours power) he toke no greate heade therof neyther was he muche inquisitiue / Mathew / Marke / Luke. Then Iesus asked hym / howe come it in to your mynde to demaunde of me this question?

come it of your selfe or haue ye herde it of ony other man? for Christe wolde be sene (as he was in verye deade) so farre and so pure from al affection or desyre of ony erthly kyngedome / that no man shulde it suspect in hym: wherupon euen Pilate his selfe as shewynge hym to haue not suspected any suche thynge in hym sayde: as for me, I am a Romane, nothynge learned in your lawes & prophe

Then aunswered Iesus, my kyngdome is not of this worlde, or elles I myghte haue my seruantes to defende me, and thus he confessed him selfe to be kyng of heuen puttyng also Pylate out of doubt yt he neaded nothyng to feare hym for his k

And Iesus shewyng the cause why he cō

Then Pilate, perceuyng hym to be vngilty of any treaso as cōcernyng Thēperours maiesty whose depute he was there, went forthe vnto the Iewes affirmynge agayne that he coulde fynde no maner a cause worthy deth in the man / Luke / Iohan. Upon this the chyef of the prestes stepte in, layeng sore agaynst hym accusyng hym that he shulde make a sedition amonge the people teachyng and prechyng through out all iury begynnyng at Galyle. And Pilate herynge thē mynde Galile, anon asked hym yf he were of Galyle, & as sone as he herde that he perteyned to Herodes iurisdiction. He sent hym to Herode whiche was then at Ierusalem wherof herode was not a lytell glade / for he was ofte before greatly desyrous to se hym, and when he came before hym, he asked hym many thyngꝭ. But Iesus answered hym nothynge, although yet the ouermoste

of the prestes and scribes stode there agaynst hym accusynge hym styfly & sharply, when Iesus reputynge Herode as a dogge or a swyne vnworthy his wordes / wolde nothyng answere hym (perauēture he asked hym nothynge concernynge the glory of god) Herode despised hym and the companye also with hym / wherfore they scorned hym & brought hym backe agayne in a whyte cote to Pilate, & for this cause Herode and Pilate, were made frendes agayne, whiche before were at oddes, and thus came the kynges of therthe to gyder agreynge to conspire agaynste the lorde & his anoynted / psalme the seconde.

For he knew it fulwel that they betrayed and betoke hym to hym of enuy and malyce, then the chyef of the prestes, and the senyors persuaded the folke to aske Barrabas Mathew▪ Marke.

what shall be done with this man Iesus / whiche is called the kynge of Iewes? and they cryed oute agayne crucifie hym. To whom Pilate answered what hurte hath he done? & then they cryed out more vehemently crucifye hym / Mathew / Marke.
               Then he, seynge yt by this waies he coulde not haue his purpose, turned hym to a nother waye whiche he had conceyued with hym selfe before sayeng I fynde nothynge worthy dethe in this man wherfore I wyl chastē hym, & so let hym go, Luke.

with feare, I was playenge with out in ye streate, and in the kyngꝭ secrete chaumbre there passed agaynst me a sentence of deth. The kynges deare and only sonne herde of this, and went forthe (layenge a syde his costly roobes and precious diademes) and clothed hym selfe in sacke cloth / sprinkling asshes on his hed, goynge barefote, wepynge and sobbynge that his seruaunte was condempned vnto death.

Truelye excepte I be mad or out of my wytte I oughte to folow hym, and morne with hym syth he morneth for me. Beholde ye cause of shame, frō whence springeth the sorow and feare? verely whē I considre the medecyne and remedy / then of that maye I esteme the quantytye and depth of my synne. I was clene ignoraunt and thoughte my selfe hole, & beholde the tender chyld of a virgyn and sonne of god almyghty was delyuered in to the handes of the vngodly & cōmaunded to be slayne / that he myght cure with ye precyouse baume of his bloude my festred woūdes, and corrupte nature, we must nedes knowlege

Euen so dyd Christe monishe the women of Hierusalē, wepe not for me, but for your owne selues and children. He added a cause, for (quod he) yf this be done in moyste wodde, what shall be done in drye, as though he sholde saye yf this be done in me whiche am pure and innocent, what shall be done in you whiche are hoelly corrupte & vicyat? ye may lerne by this my passion what ye haue deserued whiche payne (excepte ye beleue) ye can not escape here to may we well applye the prouerbe / men smyte the whelpe to feare the greate bandogge. Christ was smyten innocent to geue vs warnynge of our outragyous vices and enormityes. To this well agreeth the Prophete whiche sayeth that all ye nacyons of the erth shal bewaile them selues vpon hym, he sayeth not that they shall be wayle hym, but that they shall bewayle them selues vpon hym.

shewed (all thoughe it be but one houres space) may well haue ye sayenge of Albarte verefyed vpon hym that he hath bene better occupyed / then yf he hadde fasted euery daye a hole yere to gether or els hadde red ouer the hole psalter of Dauid. yea and I dare boldly adde that he hath better bestowed his tyme then yf he had herde a hundreth masses. For this goodly remēbraūce dothe euen renue a man, and doth testefye vnto his conscience that he is regenerate / and borne agayne / euen in a maner as wel as baptysme. So that this is the pure and naturall worke of Christes passion / to mortefye the olde man of synne that rayneth in our membres / to caste out all hope & conforte that we haue in creatures, & so depe to brynge a man in to the knowlege of his synne that he shall come euen to ye bryncke of desperation and thynke that he is forsaken of god. yet it leaueth hym not there but it bryngeth hym agayne with all consolation and conforte and sheweth hym yt all his outragious enormityes ar crucified with Christe and through his deth put out of the way that they can neuer accuse hym more / and that the fathers wrath is pacefyed by his sonnes deathe / and we all (as many as beleue that Christes death ha
                  •
               he

payd the raunsome of our synne) are set at one with god and are become his chylder so yt he is no more our iudge whiche sholde punyshe vs for our iniquityes / but wyll be called our mercyfull father whiche forgeueth his chyldrens transgressyons.
            ¶Nowe syth we can not thus fruetfullye remembre Christes passyon excepte we be enspyred with grace frome aboue (for our īpotēt & viciat nature can do no good with out ye spryte of god) the next remedye to obtayne this fruetfull gyfte is to praye & desyre it of god our father / and albeit he geue it vs not in the same tyme & moment that we wolde haue it / yet let vs not despayre & cease frome prayer. Paraduenture he holdeth it frome ye to make the more desyrous of it and to sette the more by it whan it cometh / and that thou mayst knowe that it is not in thy power and wyll to haue it at thy pleasure / but this is a cleare case that he wyll surely geue it the when it shall be moost expedient for his glory & thy welth / whiche tyme no man knoweth but he alone. Therfore let vs prescribe hym no tyme / but euer submyt our willes to his and praye that his wyll be fulfylled. And contrary wise sumtyme he geueth vs this gift before we pray or axe it / neyther geueth he

vs at all tymes the spryte to praye / but distributeth that gifte also euen at his owne godly pleasure, neyther wyll he that it be bounde other to tyme place or ony ꝑsone. when he hathe ones receyued the spyryte whiche mollefyeth the herte and bryngeth hym in to the remēbraunce of the passyon / by and by his herte trembleth / he lotheth hym selfe and knowlegeth his infyrmyte / so that the effecte of the passyō is fulfylled in hym in a maner before he be aware.
            But they that fall to theyr medytacyons & beholde this passyon beynge voyd of this spryte which openeth the herte / take great laboures & are dylygentlie occupied but al about nought: for they can nother repent nor yet ꝑceiue theyr own infyrmyte / which is the very ende & effecte of Christes passiō. So mayst thou se that the fyrste without laboure atteyne the fruete and profyte of Chrystes passyon although it appeare not outwardlye. And the other for all theyr dilygente study haue nothynge profyted / although they seme outwardly to haue god by ye fote. And thus doeth god turne topse turuea / that they whiche ar all daye occupyed in hearynge masses & in remēbr
                  •
               nge Christes passion get none aduantage. And ye other which seame to do none of bothe / do both in deade & obtayne ye hole profyte.
            
               ¶Hetherto haue we entreated the crosse, and passion of Christe by the remēbraunce wherof we knowe our infirmityes / abhorre our vices & are clene ouerthrowne ready to fal in to the pytte of desperacyon / and now wyll we touche how our consciences thus wounded, and caste downe muste be lyfte vp agayne.
            ¶ When a man begynneth on this maner to knowe and feale his synnes and trembleth at ye hydeous syght of them / let hym take good hede that those tremblynge mocions stycke not to longe in his conscyence for so sholde he fall in to vtter desperacyon, But euen as that feare / and knowlege of synne dyd sprynge out of Christes passion, so muste our conscyence vnlade her selfe agayne and laye all on Christes backe. But beware that thou do not as the vnfaithful do, for they when they feale theyr synne yt their conscience biteth them / they runne to theyr owne good workes / to satysfactions pilgrimages, and pardons / & so vexe they meruelously theyr vnquiet myndes to ryd them from theyr burden, but theyr laboure is in vayne. And yet hathe that false confidēce & trust in satisfactions so spred it selfe that it hath founded many religious cloysters in Christendō, to the vtter destruction

of all Christianite for yf I can make satysfactiō for my synnes / thē is Christes bloude shed in vayne. Therefore on this maner shalt thou vnlade thy mynde and cast thy synnes on Christe. Fyrste thou must faythfully beleue / that Christe suffered for they sake euen to redeme thy synnes / and that he toke them on his owne backe and made full satysfaction for them vnto his father / as Esa. sayeth .liij. The lorde layed on hym all our iniquities / & .i. Pet. ij. He bare our synnes in his owne body vpon the crosse. And Paule .ij. Corin. v. God made hym ye knew no synne, synne for vs (yt is to say a sacryfyce for our synne) that we thrugh hym myghte be that ryghtousnes whiche before god is alowed. Nowe ye more that thy cōscyence boyleth and ryseth agaynst the / the more shalte thou cleaue to these, and suche other comfortable sentences and put thy hole fyaunce in Christe as they teache the / for yf thou go oboute thrugh thy contricyon and satysfaccyon to pacefye and aswage thy ragynge conscyence, thou shalte neuer be in surety / but after intollerable laboure and toylynge thou shalt fall in to vtter desperacion. For the conscience can not be quyete when he fealeth his synne / but estemeth it greater then that we of our

owne power sholde be able to quenche it. Notwithstondynge yf he sawe that Christ whiche is bothe god and man had taken them vpon hym & had veynqueshed them by his death / ye and rysynge agayne had tryumphed vpon deth / hell / and the deuyl: then sholde he soone perceyue how weake the stynge and power or synne is / for euen as the paynes of his woūdes and panges of his detth do nowe no more remayne in his body: euen so are all our synnes vanyshed awaye lyke smoke. To this well agreyth the sayenge of Paule Ro. iiij. that Christe dyed for our synnes and is rysen agayne to iustyfye vs. That is / the passyon and deth of Chryste doth open and dectate our synnes vnto vs and 
                  •
               o doth take them awaye / but thorughe his rysynge agayne are we iustefyed & made free from all our synnes / yf we beleue.
            ¶How be it yf we feale our vnbelefe / that we can not be surely perswaded that these thynges are true / then is ye nexte remedy to fall vnto prayer / for this also is in the hande of god / neyther is it geuen to euery man but some haue it more and some lesse for god dirstibuteth al at his pleasure. Not withstondynge there are certayne meanes and smale pathes by the whiche a man may haue as it were an

entraūce in to his fayth. Fyrst turne thyne eyes and beholde the herty loue and bounteous kyndnes of Chryst whiche so tenderly loued the that he wold take on hym self all thy synnes / and louynglye enbrace the to heale thy wounded conscyence / yf thou remembre and thynke on this amytye thy herte shall somwhat be refresshed, and so shall thy trust in Chryst be the more encreased and stablyshed.
            ¶After that thou haste perceyued this ferueut fauoure that Chryst had towardes the / then shalt thou sone marcke what good wyll the father owed the / for then shall it appeare yt Chryst coude not endue the with suche greate benefytes, except it had bene before so decred of his heuenlye father / for vnto hym dyd Chryst obey when he suffred for thy transgressions. And so shalt thou se the flaming cheryte of god the father towardes the / & thoroughe Chryst shalt thou be so drawne to the father that thou mayst perceyue the sayenge of christ. Iohā. iii. God so loued ye world yt he gaue his onely sone for thētent yt none whiche beleue in hym shold perysh but sholde haue euerlastyng lyfe. And this is the true knowlege of god when we beholde and magnyfye not his puyssaunte maieste or his incomprehensyble prudence (for they make a man a frayde of God)

but rather his curtous and mercyful beneuolence wherin he may put his confidence and may be hooly in god renued.
            ¶ And when thy herte is so confermed in Christe that thou begynnest with full entent to hate thy synne not for feare of payne, but for ye loue that thou haste vnto god because thou woldest not dyplease hym, whiche is suche a mercyfull, and louynge father vnto the / then is it expedyent that thou take this passion for an ensample by the whiche thou mayst ordre thy lyfe. But this remembraūce is farre vnlyke the fyrst for hetherto haue we recounted it, as a secrete mystery whiche sholde worke in vs & renue vs thrugh repentaunce, and when we haue obtained that profyte, then let vs considere it as an ensample or rule to order our lyfe and workes, euer comparynge thē vnto Christes passion on this maner as foloweth.
            ¶When thou art dyseased with ony sorow or malady, then thynke how smal y• payne is, yf thou sholdest compare it with Christꝭ croune of thorne, and the nayles whiche perced his tendre flesshe.
            ¶When thou art constrayned to do or leaue vndone ony thynge whiche thou woldest not, then remembre that Christe was

bounde and tossed from post to pyller euen as it pleased his cruell enemyes.
            ¶If thou be tempted with pryde & lordlynesse, then marke how vnworthely Christe was mocked / yea and crucyfied betwene two theues, that he myghte be reputed as one of theyr nombre.
            ¶ If thou be assayled with wantonnesse, or with the luste of the flesshe / then behold howe cruellye the tendre flesshe of Christe was scourged, torne and moste pituouslye wounded.
            ¶If thy herte boyle with hate, or enuye & be full sette to take auengeaunce, then cal to thy remembraunce how Christe with a lamētable voyce dyd praye vnto his father for the and other his enemyes, whom he might by good right haue punished perpetually.
            ¶ If thou be vexed with ony other afflictions what so euer they are, whether secrete or open, take them on good worth & be not dysquieted / but thynke with thy selfe on this maner. It were a greate shame yf I sholde not suffre paciently this small trouble / syth that Christe my lorde and sauyour suffered in the garden suche panges yt he swette droppes of bloude / for what is more shame then that the seruaunt sholde

take his ease and lye slugyshly in his bedde what tyme his maister stondeth in ieoperdye of his lyfe.
            ¶Beholde / on this maner mayst thou cō
               forte and stablysh thy herte with ye passion of Christe agaynst all vexations. And this is the true meditation and remembraunce of Christes passion out of which the aforesayde commodytyes sprynge.
            ¶Therfore they that excercyse theym selues dylygentlye in it, are moche better occupyed then yf they herde a thousande tymes the storye of the passion / or sayde as many masses. And these only at ye true christen which on this wyse do expresse in theyr lyte or maners the name and lyfe of Christ as saynt Paule sayth: they that belong to Christe haue crucyfied theyr fleshe and concupiscences with Christe. Neyther is it ynoughe that we coūtrefayte hym in oure outwarde behaueoure and wordꝭ / but we muste do our endeueraunce perfytly to expresse his passion in all oure conuersacyon from ye botom of our hertes. whiche thyng Paule exhorteh vs vnto. Hebre. xij. Loke vnto Iesus the captayne of our fayth, whiche for the ioye that was sette before hym abode the crosse and despysed the shame / and is set downe on ye right hande of god.

Consider therfor how that he endured suche speakynge agaynste hym of synners / leste ye sholde be weryed or faynte in your myndes. And saynt Peter. i. Pet. iiij. sayth foras moche as Christe hath suffred in the flesshe / arme your selues lykewyse with ye same mynde. How be it the maner of this remembraunce is very rare and out of vse / although saynte Paule and saynte Peter make of
                  •
               en mencyon of it. And we haue chaunged it altogether in to an outwarde apperaunce and haue thought it suf

               icient to beholde the story of the passion paynted vpon the walles. But there are very fewe (yea almoste none) that call it to theyr remembrannce for thentent to knowe theyr synnes by it / or to quyet theyr tremblynge consciences / or to ordre and compare theyr lyfe to this ensample.
            ¶Thus endeth the meditacyon and frutefull remembraunce of Christes passion / whiche passeth all other contemplations.

               There is no healthe in my flesshe for thy wrath: there is no rest in my bones for my synnes.

But in the meane ceason my enemes lyue & were stronge: euen they whiche persue me falsely ar encresed in power. Whiche acquite me euell for good, and are agaynste me: because I soughte studeously to profyte them.

I was so dried vp with my sorowful & loude syghes: that my bones cleued to my skynne. I am lyke an destrege of the wyldernes, & made lyke an owle in an olde forlaten house. I lye wakynge & am left alone: lyke the sparowe in the thacke.
               Myne enemyes reuyled me all daye & they that chide me / vsed my name opprobriously I eate erthe in stede of brede: & lycken my teares in stede of drynke. And all is for thy indignation, and thy wrathe: for when I was a lofte thou thruest me downe.
               My dayes are vanysshed awaye lyke a shadowe: & I my selfe am whytherd lyke hay. But thou Lorde, syttest styll for euer: & thy memoriall endureth from age to age.
               Thou shalt ryse and haue pyty on Syon: for it is tyme for the to fauour it / thy daye apoynted is now come. For ye stones of it please thy seruantes verely: and they fauour her soyle. Euen the hethen also shal worshyp the name of the lorde: and all the kynges of therthe shall knowlege thy gloryous beauty. The lorde verely shal buylde spō he shall be sene in his beautiful glory.

And he shall haue respect vnto the prayer of ye poore forsaken: his praier shall he not despyse. This thyng shall be wryten for the worlde to come: and for this cause the people whiche are yet vnmade shall praise the lorde. For he shall loke forthe of his hyghe holye place: the lorde shall beholde therthe euen from heuen. To heare the syghes of them that are in bondes: and to lose the chyldren iudged to death. That they myghte preache the name of the lorde in Syon: and his prayse in Ierusalem.
               When the people and the kyngdomes: shall be gathered together to worshyp the lorde. He abated my courage in my iourney: and hathe cut of my dayes. I saye / my god / take me not away in ye miooꝭ of my dayes: for thy yeres endure throughout all ages. In the begynnyng thou layedste the foundacyon of therthe: and the heuens are thy handy worke. They shal perysshe when thou shalt staude faste: and all thyngꝭ shal wax olde lyke a garment / thou shalt dresse them agayne lyke a garment / & they shall be chaūged. But thou art euen thy very selfe: and thy yeares shall neuer be ended. The chyldren of thy seruantes shal dwell styll: and theyr posterite shall lyue prosperously and blessedly in thy presence.

               Lorde heare thou me: and let thy cares be attente vnto my deape desyre. If thou sholdest loke narowly vpon our wyckednesses (o lorde) lorde who might abyde the? But there is mercy with the: and therfore art thou worshypped. I abyde the lorde / my soule abydeth hym: & I tary lokyng vp alway for thy ꝓmyses. My soule wayteth for the lorde: as desyrously as do the watche men desyre the daye sprynge. Let Israell wayte for the lorde: for with the lorde is there mercy and plentuous redemption.

Make me shortly to heare of thy mercyable goodnes for in the do I truste: shewe me the way wherin I maye go / for vnto the haue I lyfted vp my soule.
               Delyuer me fro myne enemyes o lorde my god: for vnder the do I hyde my selfe.
               Teache me to do thy pleasures / for thou art my god: thy good spirite moughte lede me in to the ryght way. For thy names sake lorde restore me: for thy ryghtwysnes leade my soule out of this strayte anguyshe. Ye and for thy mercyes sake all to destroye my enemyes: and shake away all that trouble my soule / for I am thy seruāt Glorye be to the Father, to the sonne, and to the holye Ghoste.

Let these proude vngodly be cōfoūded for they go about to destroy me fautles: but yet shal I in ye meane tyme set al my mynde vpon thy cōmaūdemētes. Let them yt worship the & knowe thy testimonyes turne vnto me. My hert shal be ꝑfyte in thy ordinaū
                     ces: wherfor I shal not be shamed. My soule faynted longyng after thy sauyng helpe: but yet I lyft vp my eyes vnto thy ꝓmises My eyes daseled with lokyng vp after thy ꝓmise: & I sayd whan wilt thou cōfort me? I was dryed away lyke a bladder hāged in the smoke: but yet forget I not thy ordinaū
                     ces. How longe shal thy seruāt suffer these thingꝭ: whan wilt thou at last gyue sentēce agaīst my pursuers. These proude vngodly digged pitfalles for me: whiche haue no respecte vnto thy lawe. All thy p̄ceptes are faythfull and true: they ꝑsecute me vnworthyly, helpe thou me. They had almoost made an ende of me in therth: but yet in no maner wyse forsoke I thy cōmaūdemētes. Restore me for thy mercyes sake: and than shall I kepe ye testimonyes of thy mouth.
                  
                     O Lorde, thy worde standeth for euer: in the heuens. From generation to generation contynueth thy trouth: thou hast set the erth, and it stādeth styll. The tyme contynueth styll accordyng to thyne ordynaunce: for all thynges are at thy cōmaundement. Excepte thy lawe had ben my delyght: I had perysshed in myne affliction. I shall neuer therfore forgete thy cōmaundementes: for by them thou hast refresshed me. I am thyne, saue thou me: for I serched thy cōmaundementes. The vngodly wayte to destroye me: but I in the meane tyme shall endeuer me to vnderstande thy testymonyes. I perceyue that euery thyng comprehensyble hath an ende: but thy cō
                     maundementes are incomprehensyble.
                  O How excedyngly loued I thy lawe: cōtinually do I thinke therof. Thou hast made me wiser than my enemyes thorowe thy preceptes: for they are euer in my mynde. I exceded all my teachers in ryght vnderstandyng: for I am euer speakyng of thy testymonyes. I passed euen ye senyors in true vndstanding: for I obserue & marke thy cōmaūdemētes. Frō euery euyll path I refrayned my feate: to thentent I wolde obserue thy speches. I haue not swarued frō thy pleasures: for thou shalt instruct me O how swete are thy speaches in my taste:

they are sweter thā any hony in my mouth I fetche my vnderstandyng at thy cōmaū
                     demētes: wherfore I hate euery deceytfull path. I haue sworne and shall p̄fourme in to kepe thy iust plesures I am febled with affliction: lord restore me after thy ꝓmyses O lorde I beseche the, let the wyllynge sacrifices of my mouth be accepted: and teche me thy pleasures. I my selfe bryng my lyfe euer in to peryll: but yet thy lawe do I not forget. These proude vngodly haue set snares for me: but yet I swarued not from thy cōmaundementes. I haue chalenged thy testymonyes for my ꝑpetuall herytage: for they are my hertꝭ ioye. I haue bowed downe my hert to do thy ordynaūces: ye & that for euer without ende. The frantyke harde necked do I hate: & thy lawe haue I loued. Thou art my lurkynge place & my shelde: I wayte for thy promyses. Auoyde fro me ye hurtfull men: & I shall kepe the p̄ceptes of my god. Strengthen me accordynge to thy promyses, that I may lyue: let me not shamed disapoīted of my hope. Stay thou me, and I shal be saued: and I shall delyte besyly in thy ordynaūces. Thou shalt trede downe all that erre from thy ordynaūces: for all these crafty mennes studye, is to deceyue with lyes. Lyke rust thou rubbedest

away all those proude vngodly of the erth: wherfor I loued thy testīonies. My flesshe trēbled for feare of the: & I feare thy iudgementes. All my mynde was to do equite & ryghtwysnes: leue me not to myne vniuste vexers. Delyght thy seruaunt with good thingꝭ: leest these vngodly make me sorowfull with their iniuryes. My eyes dasled lokyng vp for thy sauynge helpe: & waytyng for the ꝓmyses of thy ryghtwisnes. Deale with thy seruaūt mercyably: & instructe me with thy ordynaunces. I am thy seruaūt: make me to vnderstāde & know thy testimonyes. It is tyme (lorde) to do iudgemēt: for they haue scatered abrode thy lawe. And therfore I loued thy p̄ceptes: aboue golde and precious stones. And for this I knowlege all thy cōmaūdementꝭ to be rightwise & I hate euery false path. Merueylous are thy testimonyes: wherfore my soule obserueth them. To cōme but to the dore of thy scripture lyghteneth: & gyueth vnderstondyng to the vnlerned. I drewe in my breth fayntly: for that I laboured so sore to attayne vnto. Beholde & haue thy preceptes mercy vpon me, accordyng to thy iudgemē
                     tes: wherwith thou gouernest the louers of thy name. Rule my steps after thy pleasures: & suffer no iniquite to haue dominiō ouer me. Redeme me frō ye iniuryes of men

and I shal kepe thy cōmaūdemētes. Make thy face to shyne vpon thy seruāt: & instruct me in thy ordynaūces. Stremes of water gusshed out of my eyes: bycause I se men not obseruynge thy lawe. Ryghtwyse art thou (o lord): & ryght are thy iudgemētes. Thou hast cōmaūded in thy testimonyes▪ ryghtwysnes & faythfulnes moost chyefly. My zele to thy worde killed me: bycause my pursuers forgat it. Thy wordes are purely tryed, lyke as with fyre: & thy seruāt loueth them. I was a lytel on, & an abiect: but yet forgate I not thy cōmaundementes. Thy ryghtwysnes is euerlastyng: & thy lawe is the very trewth. Than afflictiō & heuynes had taken me: than thy cōmaūdemētes refresshed me. The beleuyng of thy ꝓmyses is euerlastyng ryghtwisnes: gyue me vnderstandyng of this, and I shall lyue. I called vpon the with al my hert: graūte me (lord) and I shall obserue thy ordinaūces. I called vpō the / saue thou me: I shall kepe thy testimonyes. I preuente ye dawnyng of the day: & crye vnto the, I wayte for thy ꝓmyses. My eyes preuēted the watches: that I myght be occupyed in thy plesures. Heare me lord for thy mercies sake: quicken me after thy pleasures. My pursuers layde theyr owne fautꝭ vpō my neck: but they ar gone

farre backe frō thy lawe. Thou art present o lorde: and all thy preceptes are the very selfe trouthe. I knewe this before of thy testymonies: for thou hast stablisshed them to abyde for euer. Beholde my affliction & defende me, for I forget not thy lawe. Defende my cause and delyuer me: quicken me after thy promyses. Helthe is farre frō the vngodly: for they regarde not thy ordynaū

I se these malycious men, and it irked me: bycause they obserued not thy sayinges. Thou seest that I loue thy cōmaūdementes: lorde for thy mercyes sake quicken me. The begynnynge of thy wordes is trouth: and the iudgementes of thy ryghtwysnes standeth for euer. The ouermost in au

Seuen tymes in the day I prayse the: for thy rightwyse iudgemētes. The louers of thy lawe shall haue moche felicite & quietnes and no hurte at all. I trust vpon thy helpe (lorde) & gyue diligēce to thy preceptes. My soule

obserueth thy tessymonyes: & loueth them greatly. I obserue thy cōmaundementes and thy testimonyes: for all my wayes are open vnto the. Let my cryenge ascende in to thy presence (o lord) make me ryghtly to vnderstande thy wordes. Let my depe desyre cōme in to thy syght: delyuer me accordyng to thy ꝓmyses. My lyps shall poure forth thy prayse: thou shalt īstruct me in thy ordynaūces. My tung shall speake of thy pleasures: for all thy p̄ceptes are ryghtwisnes. Let thy hande helpe me: for I haue chosen thy cōmaūdemētes. I desyred thy sauyng helpe (lord): and thy lawe is my delyte. My soule shall lyue & prayse the: and thy iudgementes shall be my helpe. I am strayed lyke a lost shepe: seke thou thy seruant, for thy cōmaundementes haue I not forgoten.

               All that se me, made but a laughyng stock on me: they mocked me with theyr lyppes: and wagged theyr heddes at me.

As soone as I came in to this worlde, I was layde in thy lappe: thou art my God euen from my mothers wombe. Go thou not farre from me: for my trouble draweth nygh / neyther is there any man that wyll helpe. There are beset me rounde aboute greate sturdy steares: ye the fatte bulles of Bashan haue hedged me in. Lyke a rorynge lyon pantynge and gapynge for his proye: theyr mouthes are open vpon me naked before them. I sanke awaye lyke water: all my bones shoke out of ioynte: my hert within me melted away lyke waxe.

For euen lyke dogges they came aboute me: the chyrche of noyous men hedged me in / they dygged thorowe my handes & fete. A man myght haue tolde all my bones: & they gasyng vpon me thus pytyles entreated / toke theyr pleasure. They parted my ouer clothes to them self: and for my other

cote they casted dyce. But thou (oh lorde) be not farre: o my strengthe / haste the to cōme & helpe me. Delyuer my lyfe from the deth stroke: and my deare soule from the woodnes of these dogges. Saue me from the mouthes of these lyons: and defende my poore simplenes from the hornes of these vnicornes. I shall sprede thy name among my bretherne: in the myddes of the congregacyon I shall prayse the. I saye▪ ye that feare ye lorde, se that ye prayse hym: all ye of the sede of Iacob gloryfye hym, & all ye of the progeny of Israel, feare hym. For he hath not despised nor abhorred the troublous affliction of the poore: in no maner of wyse turneth he his face from hym: but whan he cryed vnto hym he herd hym. I shall prayse the in the greate congregacyon: I shall ꝑforme my vowes before his worshyppers. The meke men shall eate & be satisfyed / they that seke the lorde shall prayse hym / theyr herte shall lyue and ioye for euer. The dwellers in thextreme partes of the erth shall remembre themselues and be turned to the lorde: and all hethen nations shall fall downe before the.
               For the kyngdome is the lordes: and he is lorde ouer al nations. All the ryche men of the erth shall eate and do hym homage:

they shal be bowed downe before hym, and descende in to theyr graues / for they may not prolonge ony lyfe to thyyr soules.
               But theyr postertie shall serue hym: & shall be nombred to the lorde for euer.
               And thus theyr chylders chylderne shall shewe the ryghtwisnes: whiche he hath gyuen to ye people whiche is yet to be borne.

For they regarded not the workes and dedes of the lorde: he shall therfore destroye them / and not edyfye them. Praysed be the lorde: for he hathe herde the depe desyres of my mynde. The lorde is my strengthe, he is my buckler, in hym trusted my hert, and

I was holpen: wherfore my hert reioyseth and I shall magnyfye hym in my songe.

The voyce of the lorde is in the watery cloudes: god whose maieste is to be feared with reuerence thondreth / the lorde is declared vpon great waters. The voyce of the lorde is passynge stronge: the voyce of the lorde is full of maieste. The voyce of the lorde smyteth togyther ceder trees: the lorde breaketh togyther the ceders of Libani. He maketh the mountaynes of Libani and Hireion to leape togyther lyke calues: they ranne togyther lyke the calues of vnicornes. The voyce of the lorde: casteth and cutteth forth fyry lyghtenynges. The voyce of the lorde maketh the deserte to quake: the lorde made euen the deserte of Kades to tremble.

Lorde, of thy good wyll thou stablysshdest my kyngdom lyke an hyll: for as soone as thou hadst turned away thy face, I was astonyed & troubled.

The lorde called I vpon: to the lorde did I make my prayer. I said with my self what ꝓfyteth my lyf, yf I be put now in to my graue? shall the dust of my karcas magnyfye the / or yet declare thy faythfulnes? Heare lorde & haue mercy vpon me: (lorde) be thou my helpe. Thou hast turned my mournyng in to ioye: thou hast shaken me out of my mournyng sacke and clothed me with gladnes. Wherfore my tunge shall synge thy prayse, and shall not cease: (lorde my god) I shall magnyfye the with prayse in to euerlastynge.

what meanest thou by the secunde cōmaū
                  dement. Ans.

Faythe and truste fynde hym when we are in parell and shew hym vnto vs, and yet this fayth to fynde hym muste he geue vs: for yf we gete vs a fayth of our owne fasshonynge wherby we beleue and

truste in ony other thynge then god then make we vs an ydole: for it is ye faythe and trust only in our hertes that maketh other god or ydole: for yf oure faythe and truste be ryght and pure, then haue we the very true god: but yf it be false and fayned then muste we neades fayne vs a false and a lyenge god: for true fayth and god ar ioyned to gyder with one knotte, so that in what so euer thynge thou trustest and beleauest / that same is thy god, here now maist thou well se that in these two fyrst cōmaūdmētꝭ god requireth & asketh all our hoole hertes, and in the thyrde, he asketh our mouthes and tongues to be vsed for his prayse and holynes of his name.

We are all synners and haue neade of the mercy of god: yf we were not all synners: ye mercy of god shold take none effecte in vs wherfore the scrypture concludeth that all men are synners: that as manye as shall be saued sholde be saued by goddes mercye onely.

                  •
               o flye vnto the (oh lorde) yet wyl I not come as the Pharise whiche prayed not. but rather praysed hym selfe, & despised his neighboure, but I come vnto the, as ye publican Lu. xviij. which durst not lyfte vp his iyes vnto Heauen. For I also do knowlege myne inyquyte / and whyles I pondre my synnes I dare not lyfte vp myne lyes / but humbelynge my selfe with the Publicane

I saye: God be mercyfull to me a synner. My soule wauereth betwene hope & feare and somtyme for ye feare of my synnes (whiche I feale and knowlege to be in me) I am ready to despayre / somtyme throughe the hope of thy mercy / I am lyfted vp and conforted. Neuerthelesse because that thy mercy is greater thē my misery I wyl euer lorde truste in the and wyll synge oute thy plentuous compassyons for euer. For I knowe that thou desyrest not the deathe of a synner / but rather that he were conuerted and that he wolde knowlege his iniquite and forsake his synne / and so come to the that he maye lyue.
            ¶ My god graunte me that I maye lyue in the / for I knowlege my wyckednesse / I knowe what a greuous burthen it is, how copious / & how ieoperdious. I am not ignoraunt of it / I hide it not but set it euē before myne eies / that I maye washe it with my teares and knowlege vnto the Lorde myne vnryghtwysnesse agaynste my selfe. And also my synne which I haue proudly done agaynste the / is euer agaynst me / and therfore it is agaynste me / because I haue sinned agaynst the: & it is truly against me / for it is euē against my soule / & accuseth me euer before the my iudge & condēpneth me

euer & in euery place: and it is so agaynste me that it is euer before my face and stondeth but agaynst me that my prayer maye not perce through vnto the / that it myght take thy mercy fro me & hynder thy mercye yt it can not come at me: therfore do I trē
               ble and therfore do I morne besechyng thy mercy. Therfore oh lorde as thou hast gyuen this grace vnto me to knowe my wickednesse and to bewayle my synne: euē so accomplysh this thy beneuolence gyuynge me a ꝑfayte fayth & drawyng me vnto thy sonne which hath made a ful satisfactiō for all my sinnes. Geue me lorde this precious gyfte for euery good gyfte and euery parfeyte gyfte is from aboue comyng from the father of lyght.
            Agaynst the only haue I synned: & haue done that which is euyll in thy sight: yt thou maist be iustified in thy wordꝭ: & mayst haue ye victorie when thou art iudged.
            ¶I haue ouermoch sinned vnto the alone / for thou cōmaundedst me yt I sholde loue ye for thy selfe / & shold loue al creatures for thy sake. But I haue loued a creature more then yt / louynge it euen for it selfe. What is synne, but to loue a creature for it selfe? and what is that / but to do agaynst the? Surely he y• loueth a creature for it selfe maketh that creature his God.

And therfore haue I synned agaynste the onely / for I haue made a creature my god. So haue I caste the awaye / and haue ben iniurious only to the / for I haue not offended agaynste ony creature in that I haue set my truste or confidence in it. For it was not cōmaunded me that I sholde loue ony creature for it selfe. Yf thou haddest cōmaū
               ded me that I sholde haue loued an aungell onely for hym selfe / and I had loued mony for it selfe / then no doubte I had offended agaynst the angell. But sith y• thou only art to be loued for thy selfe (that is to say without ony respecte other of good or euyll) and euery creature is to be loued in the & for thy sake. Therfore haue I surely offended onely agaynst the / for I haue loued a creature for it selfe.
            ¶But yet haue I worse done / for I haue synned euen ī thy syght. I was nothīg asshamed to synne before thy face. Oh merciful god / how many synnes haue I done in thy syght which I wolde in no wyse haue done before mortal mē / yea yt I wolde not in ony case yt men sholde knowe I feared men more then ye / for I was blinde & loued blyndnes / & so did I nether se nor ones cō
               sidre the. I had only fleshly eyes / therfore did I only feare and loke on men whiche

ar flesh. But thou lokedst on al my synnes and numbred them / therfore I can nether hyde them frō the / nether turne my backe and flye from thy face.
            ¶Whether shall I go from thy spirite and whether shall I flye from thy face? what shall I then do? whether shall I turne me? whome shall I fynde to be my defender? whom I praye you but the my god? who is so good? who is so gētle? who is so mercyfull? for thou passest without comparisō al creatures in gentlenesse. It is one of thy chyefest propertyes to forgeue and be mercifull / for throughe mercy and forgeuenesse thou dost most declare thy almyhgtynesse. I graunt lorde that I haue offended only agaynst the / and haue done that whiche is euyll in thy syght. Haue mercy therfore on me & expresse thy puysaunce in me / yt thou mayst be iustified ī thy wordꝭ / for thou hast sayde: yt thou camest not to cal yt rightwise / but synners vnto repentaunce. Iustifie me lorde accordyng to thy wordes: call me / receyue me / and gyue me grace to do true workes of repentaūce. For this cause wast thou crucyfied / deade and buryed. Thou saydest also: Iohn̄. iij. whē I am lyfted vp from of the earth / I wyl drawe al vnto my selfe / verefie thy wordꝭ, draw me after ye let

vs rūne to gether in ye swetenesse of thyne oyntmentes. Besydes that thou saydeste: Math. xi. Come vnto me all ye ye laboure / and are laden, and I wyll ease you. Loo I come vnto the laden with synnes / laboryng day and nyght in the sorow of myne harte refresh and ease me lorde that thou mayste be iustefied and proued true in thy wordes / and mayste ouercome when thou art iudged / for there are manye that saye: he shall haue no socoure of his god. God hath forsaken hym. Ouercome lorde these parsones when thou arte thus iudged of them & forsake me not at any tyme. Gyue me thy mercye and holesome socoure / and then are they vaynqueshed.
            ¶They saye / that thou wylt haue no mercye on me / & that thou wylte cast me clene out of thy fauoure & no more receyue me. thus art thou iudged of men / and thus do men speake of ye / and these are theyr determynacyons / but thou whiche arte meke & merciful haue mercy on me and ouercome theyr iudgemētes / shewe thy mercy on me and let thy godlye pytye be praysed in me. Make me a vessell of thy mercye / yt thou mayste be iustefied in thy wordes & haue the vyctorye when men do iudge the / for men do iudge the to be firce and inflexible.

Ouercome theyr iudgemēt with mekenes & beneuolence / so y• men may lerne to haue compassion on synners / and that malefatours may be enflamed vnto repentaunce, seynge in me / thy pytye and mercye.
            Lo I was fasshoned ī wyckednes & my mother cōceyued me poluted with synne. ¶Beholde not lorde the greuousnes of my synnes / cōsidre not the multitude but loke mercifully on me whiche am thy creature. Remēbre y• I am dust / & that al fleshe is as wytherd hay / for lo I am fasshoned in wickednes & in sinne hath my mother cōceiued me. My naturall mother (I say) hath conceiued me of cōcupiscēce / & in hir am I polluted with originall synne. What is originall synne / but ye lacke of originall iustice & of the ryght & pure innocēcy which mā had at his creacyon? therfore a man cōceiued & barne in suche synne is hole croked & out of frame. The fleshe coueteth against ye spirit. Reason is slender / ye wyl is weake / man is fraile & like vanitie / his sences deceiue him, his ymagynacyon fayleth hym his ignoraunce leadeth him out of the ryght way / & he hath infinite īpedimentꝭ which plucke hym frome goodnes and dryue hym in to euyll. Therfore oryginall synne is the rote of all synnes & the nurse of all wickednesse.

for all be it yt in euery man of theyr owne nature it is but one synne yet in power it is all synnes. Thou seiste therfore Lorde what I am. and of whence I am, for in origynall synne (which conteyneth al synnes and iniquites in it) am I fasshoned / and in it hath my mother cōceaued me, syth then I am hole in synnes, and enuyroned with snares on euery side, howe shall I escape? for what I wolde that do I not / but the euyll that I wolde not that do I. For I finde a nother lawe in my membres rebellynge agaynste the lawe of my mynde / and subduynge me vnto the lawe of synne and deth. Therfore the more frayle and entangled thy godly beneuolēce seeth me, so much the more let it lyft vp and confort me, who wolde not pytye one yt is syke? who wolde not haue compassion on hym that is dyseased? Come come swete Samaritane & take vp the wounded and halfe deade / cure my woundes / poure in wyne and oyle, set me vpon thy beest, bringe me into the hos
                  •
               ry / cōmytte me vnto the hoste, take out two pence & saye vnto hym, what so euer thou spendest aboue this, when I come agayne I wyll recōpence ye. Lo thou hast, loued truth / ye vnknowne & secrete 
                  •
               gyngꝭ of thy wysdome, haste thou vttered vnto me.
            
               ¶Come most swete Samaritane / for beholde thou haste loued truthe / the truthe (I saye) of thy promyses whiche thou hast made vnto mankynde / theym haste thou truly loued: for thou haste made and kepte them / so that thy loue is nothynge els but euen to do good for in thy selfe thou art inuariable & immutable thou vsest not now to loue & anon not to loue (as mē do) neyther doth thy loue so come & go. But thou art suche a louer as dothe neuer chaunge for thy loue is very god. Thy loue therfore wherwith thou louest a creature / is to do it good, and whom thou most louest / to them art thou moste beneficyall. Therfore what meaneth / that thou louest truthe / but that of thy gracious mercy thou makest vs promyses / and fulfyllest them for thy truthes sake? Thou dydest promyse vnto Abraham a sonne when he was aged / thou fulfilledst thy promyse in olde and bareyn Sara / because thou louedst truth. Thou promisedst vnto the chyldren of Israell a lande that flowed with milke and honye / and at the last didest geue it thē / for thy truthes sake. ¶ Thou madest a promyse to Dauid sayenge: I shall set vp thy seate regall one of the frute of thy bodye. and it came euen 
                  •
               o passe / because thou woldest be founde true.

There are other innumerable promyses in which thou hast euer bene faithful because thou louedst truthe. Thou haste promysed to synners which wyll come vnto the / forgyuenesse and fauour / and thou hast neuer defrauded man for thou hast loued truthe. That vnthryftye Sonne Luce. xv. that toke his iourney in to a farre countre and wasted all his goodes with royatous lyuynge / when he came to hym selfe / he retourned vnto the sayenge: father I haue synned agaynst heuen and before the / now am I not worthye to be called thy sonne / make me as one of thy hyred seruauntes. When he was yet a greate waye of / thou sawest hym and haddest cōpassion on him / and rannest vnto hym / fallynge vpon his necke and kyssynge hym / thou broughtest forth the best garment and puttest a rynge on his finger and showes on his fete / thou kylledst that fatted calfe and madest all the house mery saieng let vs eate and be mery / for this my sonne was deade and is alyue agayne / he was lost and is now founde.
            ¶Why didest thou al this lorde god? surelye because thou louedst truth. Loue therfore (o father of mercies) this truthe in me / which returne vnto ye frō a far cūtre runne towardꝭ me & geue me a kys of thi mouth / 

geue me those chefe garmētꝭ / draw me ī to thy house / kyll y• fatted calfe that all which truste in the maye reioyce in me / and lette vs eate together in spyrytuall feastes. Oh lorde wylte thou exclude me alone & wylte thou not kepe this truth vnto me? yf thou shuldest loke narowly on our wickednesse o lorde: Lorde who myght abyde the? But lorde thou wylte not be soo strayte vnto vs / for thou louest truth: ye and that with a feruent and incomprehensyble loue.
            ¶Whiche is the truth that thou so louest? is it not thy sonne that sayde Iohan. xiiij. I am the waye / truth / and lyfe? he is the very truthe of whom all truthe is named in heuen and in earthe / this is it that thou haste loued and in it only haste thou delyted for thou dydeste fynde it pure and with out spotte and woldeste that it shulde dye for synners. Kepe therfore (Oh god) this truthe / beholde I am a greate synner in whome thou mayste kepe it / to whome thou mayst forgeue many synnes / whome thou mayste purifye in the bloude of thy Chryste / and whome thou mayste redeme through his passion why (Oh Lorde) hast thou geuē me this knowlege of thi sonne / and this fayth of hym? Because I sholde se my redempcyon and not to attayne it that

I myght by that meanes be the more vexed with sorowe? God forbyd. But rather that I maye perceyue the remission of my synnes purchased by Christes bloude / and so by his grace maye obteyne it. Purge me therfore & redeme me oh lorde (for thou hast vttered vnto me the vnknowne and secret poyntes of thy wysdome) that this knowlege maye helpe me and brynge me vnto health / for truely the Phylosophers neuer knewe these thyngꝭ / they were vnknowne vnto them / yea and vtterly hyd frō them. And no man knewe these thynges (excepte a fewe whom thou louedste entyrelye) before thy sonnes incarnacyon.
            ¶The moste curious serchers of ye worlde (I meane the wyse men of this worlde) lifted vp theyr eyes aboue heuen & yet coulde not fynde this thy wysdom / for thou haste hyd these thynges from the wyse and prudente / and haste opened them vnto babes / that is / to hūble fysshers and thy holy propehtes which also haue vttered them vnto vs. And so hast thou vttered ye vnknowne and secrete thynges of thy wysdom and of thy scryptures vnto me / why do I knowe them in vayne? I knowe theym surelye in vayne if they profyt me not vnto my helth and saluacion. For the philosophers when

they knewe god by his meruelous creatures they gloryfied hym not as god neyther were thankefull / but vexed full of vanities in theyr imaginacyons and theyr folysshe hertes were blynded. When they counted them selues wyse / they became foles. Wylt thou suffer me lorde to be of theyr numbre? God forbyd. For thou arte euen mercye it selfe which doth neuer vtterly forsake any man. Fauoure therfore lorde / fauour and spare thy seruaunt / and cōmaunde hym to be of the numbre of thy babes / that the vnknowne secretes of thy wysdom whiche thou haste opened to hym maye leade hym vnto the fountayne of wysdome whiche is an hye / that thou mayste be praysed in the worke of thy mercye whiche thou doste exercyse towardes thy seruante (Lorde) whiche neuer forsakest them that truste in the.
            Sprynkle me Lorde with ysope and so shall I be clene / thou shalt washe me / and then shall I be whytter then snowe.
            ¶Because lorde that thou haste loued the truthe and haste opened vnto me the vnknowne secretes of thy wisdom / I am wel counforted and I trust that thou wylt not cast me out of thy fauoure / but thou wylte sprynkle me with ysope and soo shall I be clensed. Ysope is a lowe herbe / it is hote

and of a good sauour / whiche sygnyfyeth nothynge els / but thy onely sone our lord Iesu chryst / which humbled hym self vnto deth: euen vnto ye deth of the crosse. Which with the hete of his feruent charyte loued vs / and washed vs from our synnes in his bloude. Which with the redolent sauoure of his beneuolence and ryghtuousnes replenyshed the hole worlde. Therfore with this ysope shalte thou spryncle me / when thou poureste vpon me the vertue of his bloude: when Chryste thrughe fayth shall dwell in me: when thrughe loue I am ioyned with hym: when I shall countrefayte his humylyte and passyon / then shall I be clensed frome all myne vnclennes. Then shalte thou washe me with myne owne teares which flowe out of ye loue of christ / then shall I syghe vntyll I be werye / I shall water my bed euery nyght with my teares / so that it shall swymme in them / & then shalte thou wasshe me and I shall be whytter then snowe.
            Snowe is whyte and colde / but lorde yf thou spryncle me with ysope, I shall be more whyter then snowe / for I shall be thrughly endued with thy splendent light whiche passeth all bodelye wytnesse. And when I am enflamed with yt lyght I shall

forsake all my carnall cōcupiscences / colde vnto worldly thigꝭ / & ēflamed vnto heuēly
            Unto my hearynge shalte thou geue ioye and gladnes & my brosed bones shall be refreshed.
            ¶Then lorde shall I pray vnto the / erly (that is in the begynnyge of thy lyght) shalt thou heare my voyce and I shal heare what ye lorde god shall speake in me for he shall speake peace for his people and shall geue me peace. Lorde thou shalte geue me peace for I haue trusted in the / vnto my hearyng shalt thou geue ioy and glagdnesse / when I shall heare that confortable wordes that marie herde. And what herde marie (I speake of that marye which sate at the fete of Iesus mat. xxvj.) what herde she? Thy fayth hath saued the go thy wayes in peace. Let me also heare that the thefe herde: this daye shalte thou be with me in paradyse / then shall I haue ioye for the remyssyon of my synnes / and gladnesse for thy bounteous and lyberall promyses / shall I not reioyce and be glad / when thou shalt gyue me two folde for all my synnes? then shall I begynne to taste how swete the lorde is / then shall I lerne to be cōuersant in heuenly thīgꝭ and shall saye with the prophete: how great and copious is that swetenesse lorde which thou haste layde vppe for theym that feare the.

Then shall I reioyse and be glad and my brosed bones shall be refresshed. What are the bones whiche sustayne the flesshe but the powers of oure soule and reason that bere vp the fraylte of oure flesshe that he runne not hedlonge in to all vyces / that a man fall not hole in to vanite and so consume awaye? These bones I saye are sore brosed / for the reason is very weake / and the wyll is prone & ready to all myschyef / for euen nowe the fleshe obeyeth not reason / but reason muste obaye the flesshe / so that I can not resist vyce, for my bones at brosed. And why are they brosed? for they haue forsaken the / the fountaine of liuyng water / and haue dygged for them selues cesterns full of chynnes whiche can holde no waters / for they are not filled with thy grace withoute whiche no man can lyue well / for without the we can do nothyng. They trusted in theyr owne power which is no power and therfore decayed they in theyr owne folysshnesses. Therfore let thy power come (oh lorde) and then shal these brosed bones be refresshed / let thy grace come & that faith which worketh through loue. Let thy powers and giftes assist me / and then my brosed bones shall be refreshed / for my reason shall be mercy / my memorye

glad and my wyll full of ioye. And thus shall they all reioyse / for aboue theyr owne naturall strenghte / when they goo aboute ony good worke they shall procede and prospere well / neither shall they leaue it vnperfeyte but through thy helpe shall they brynge it to good passe and effecte.
            Turne thy face from of my synnes and wype awaye all my wyckednes.
            ¶Why lokest thou lorde vpon my sinnes? why nūbrest thou them? why considerest them so dilygētlye? doste thou not knowe that man is euen as a floure of the felde. why doste thou not rather loke in the face of thy Christe? Alas wretche that I am. why se I the angry agaynst me? I graunt I haue synned / howe be it for thy gentlenesse haue mercye on me. Turne thy face from of my synnes. Thy face is nothynge but thy knowlege / turne awaye therfore thy knowlege from my synnes. I meane not that knowlege wherwith thou seest & perceyuest all thynges / but that wherby thou approuest and disalowest al thinges / wherbye thou alowest the workes of the ryghtwyse and condempnest the reprouable synnes of the wycked / knowe not my synnes on that maner that thou woldest impute them vnto me and laye theym to

my charge. But rather turne awaye thy face frome my synnes that throughe thy mercy they may be quenched / loke lord on the creature whom thou haste wroughte / loke vpon thine owne ymage / for I poore wrethe haue put vpon me the ymage of ye deuyll (that is synne) turne away thy face from the ymage of the deuyll and be not angry with me / and beholde thyne owne image that thou maist haue mercy on me.
            ¶O mercyfull lorde / remembre that thou lokedste vpon Zacheum whiche dyd clym vp in to a wylde figge tre to se the. Lu. xix. And thou entredst in to his house whiche thou woldest neuer haue done if thou haddest loked on the ymage of the deuyll whiche he had put on hym / but because thou sawest thyne owne ymage on hym / thou haddest compassion on hym & beledst him. He promysed to geue ye halfe of his goodꝭ to the poore / and yf he had falsly deceyued ony man to restore it foure folde & he obtayned mercy and healthe. And I bequeth my selfe euen hole vnto ye nothynge reserued. And promyse to serue ye for euer with a pure herte & wil fulfil my ꝓmyse al daies of my lyfe wherfore then Lorde dost thou not loke in thyne ymage in me also? why dost thou yet consydre my synnes? Turne

I beseche the thy face frō my synnes and wipe away al my wickednes / wype away al I praye ye that none remayne. For it is wryten he yt kepeth the hole lawe & offendeth in one poynte is gyltye in the hole / yt is to say, hath deserued dampnatiō / which is the payne of all synnes that leade vnto deathe.

            A pure herte create in me oh god & an vpryghte spiryte make a newe within me. ¶For my herte hath forsaken me & goeth astraye vtterly forgettyng his owe helthe: it is wandred in to straūge cuntres & ensueth vanities / & his eies / are in ye vtmust costes of the worlde.

A pure hert create ī me go / an hūble herte / a curteous herte / a peaceable herte / a gētle herte / a deuout herte / such an herte as wyl nether do an other mā hurte / nether yet auenge him selfe whē he is offended / but rather do good agaynst euyl, & suche an hert as wyll loue ye aboue all thyng / which wil thinke of ye, speke of the, & thanke ye, which wyll delyte in hympnes & spiritual songes and be hole conuersaunt in heuēly thyngꝭ

Create this herte in me (oh God) create it of no thyng / that it may be of suche effecacite throughe grace / as nature is neuer able to make it.

And why shall I offer for my synnes tother praise thē sacryfice? for if thou haddest desyred sacryfices I had surely ofred them / but thou delyghtest not in brente sacryfices / canst thou be pacefied with the bloude of calues or gootꝭ? Wilt thou eate ye fleshe of bulles / or drynke the bloude of gootes? Other dost thou desyre golde whiche possessest heuen and earthe? other wylt thou that I sacryfice my body vnto the whiche desyrest not the deathe of a synner / but rather that he were conuerted and lyue?
            Neuerthelesse I wyll chasten my fleshe in a measure that through thy grace it maye be subdued vnto reason and obey it / for in this poynt also yf I passe measure & bryng my body so lowe that it is vn apte to serue my neyghboure and to do that office whiche is apoynted me of god / it shall be imputed vnto me for synne. Let your seruing of god be resonable sayth ye apostle Ro. xij. And thou haste sayde also by the prophete I require mercy and not sacrifice Osee. vi. Therfore shal my mouthe shewe forth thy prayse / for this oblacion doth honour the / and sheweth vs the way vnto thy sauyng helth. My herte is ready (oh god) my hert is readye / it is ready through thy grace to do all thynges whiche are pleasaunt vnto the: this one thynge haue I founde most

acceptable vnto the / that wyl I offer vnto the / that shall euer be in my herte / on that shall my lyppes euer be harpynge / yf thou haddest desyred a bodely sacryfyce I wolde surely haue geuē it the / for my herte is readye through thy grace to fulfyll thy wyll: but in suche brente sacryfyce haste thou no delyght / thou madest the body for ye spirit / therfore seakest thou spirituall thyngꝭ and not bodelye / for thou sayste in a certeyne place Prouerb. xxiij. My sonne geue thine herte vnto me / this is the herte yt pleaseth the. Let vs offer vnto the an herte repentynge with sorow of our fynnes and enflamed with the loue of heuenlye thyngꝭ and then wylte thou desyre no more / for with suche a sacryfyce wylte thou be content.
            A sacryfyce to god is a broken spyryte: a contrite and humble herte thou shalte not despyse (oh god)
            ¶ A broken spirite and not broken fleshe pleaseth the (o Lorde) for the fleshe is broken and vexed because he hath not the carnall thynges that he desyreth / or els fealeth in hym selfe suche thynges as he hateth. But the spyrite is broken and vnquyeted for his faute / because he hath offended agaynst god whom he loueth. He soroweth yt he hathe synned agaynste his maker & redeemer / ye he hath despysed his bloude / 

that he hathe not regarded suche a good & louynge father: this broken & sorowynge spryte is vnto the a sacryfyce of most swete sauoure whiche notwithstondynge hathe his confeccyon of most bytter spyces / euen of the remēbraunce of our synnes, for whyles our synnes are gathered togyther in to the morter of the herte / and beaten with the pestle of conpunccyon / and made in to poudre and watered with teares / therof is made an oyntemente and sacryfyce moost swete which redolent offrynge thou wylt not despyse / for thou wylt not despyse a cō
               tryte and humble herte. Therfore he that breaketh his stonye herte whiche is made with the most harde stones of synne / that he maye therof prepare an oyntmente of repentaunce in aboūdaunce of teares / not despayrynge of the multytude and greuousnes of his synnes / but humblye offerynge this sacryfyce vnto the: he shall in no wyse be despysed of the / for a broken & humble hert wylt thou not despise oh god. Marye magdalyn whiche was a notable synner made suche an oyntment: and put it in the allablaster boxe of her herte: she feared not to entre ī to ye Pharesees house, she humbled her selfe flatte before thy fete / she was not a shamed to wepe at thy meletyde / she coulde not speake for inwarde sorowe / 

but her herte melted in to teares / with the whiche she washed thy fete / she wypyd them with her here immedyatlye / ye & anoynted theym with oyntment and ceased not kyssynge them. Who euer sawe suche a nother thyng? ye or who hath euer herde of a thynge lyke vnto this? Surely her sacryfyce pleased the well, and was so acceptable that thou prefarredst it aboue the Pharise which in his owne syght was ryghtwyse / for it may be gathered of thy wordes. Luce. vij. that there was so moch dyfference betwen the ryghtwysnes of marye & the pharesee as there was dyfference betwene these: to washe the fete with water / & to washe them with teares: to kysse one on ye face / and not to cease to kysse the feete: to anoynt the hed with oyle / and to anoynt the fete: with most precyous oyntment: ye moche more precelled she the pharesee / for he neyther gaue the water / kysse nor oyle. O grete is thy power Lord / grete is thy myght which declareth it selfe most cheeflye in sparynge and hauynge compassyon. Now se I well that a contryte & meke herte thou shalt not despyse oh lord. And therfore endeuoure I my selfe to offre suche an herte vnto ye. Nether is it ynough that I saye so outwardely / for thou arte a god whiche searchest our hertes & raynes.

Accepte therfore this my sacryfyce: and ye it be vnperfyte / amende thou the defaulte which onely arte of power that to do: that it may be a brent sacryfyce / all hole enflamed with the heate of thy bounteous cheryte that it may be acceptable vnto the / or at the leest that thou despyse it not / for yf thou despyse it not / I knowe well that I shall fynde fauoure before the, and then shall none of thy sayntes other in heauen or erthe despyse me.

that thou of thy fauourable beneuolence woldest deale gentlye with syon: that the walles of Hierusalē myght be bilt agayn. Syon is thy chyrche / for syon by interpretacyon sygnyfyeth a footehyll / or a place where a man maye se farre aboute hym.

Deale lorde accordynge to thy fauourable beneuolence / and do not with us after our deseruyng / nether yelde thou vs againe according to our iniquities / but ordre vs accordynge to thy greate mercye. Thou art Lorde our father and redemer / thou art our hope and euerlastyng helthe.

And agayne when thou brethedst on them / then are they created anew: and thus renuest thou the face of the earth Psalme .C.iiij. Lorde I praye the what profyt is there in the dampnacyon of so many thousande men? Hell is fylled and thy churche doth daylye decrease. Aryse Lorde / why sleapest thou so longe? Aryse / and dyffer not vnto the ende / Deale gently of thy fauourable beneuolēce with Syon / that the walles of Ierusalem may be buylded agayne / what is Ierusalem (whiche by interpretacyon signyfyeth the vysyon of peace) but the holye congregacyon and cytye of the blessed whiche is our

And then acceptest thou the sacryfices of ryghtwysnes / when thou fattenest with thy grace the soules whiche endeuoure them selues to lyne rightwisly. What profiteth to offer sacryfices vnto the when thou acceptest them not oh Lorde? Howe manye sacryfyces offer we nowe a dayes whiche are not pleasaunt vnto the but rather abhomynable? for we offre not the sacryfyces of ryghtwysnes / but oure owne ceremonyes: and therfore are they

not accepted, nor regarded of the. Where is nowe the glorye of the Apostles? where is the valyaunt perseueraunce of martyrs? where is the frute of preachers? where is that holye symplicyte of them that vsed to lyue solitarye? where are now the vertues and workes of the christen whiche were in olde tyme? Then shalt thou excepte theyr sacryfices / when thou shalt decke and garnyshe them with thy grace and vertues.

Then shall the oblacyons of the preestes and of the clargie be acceptable vnto the / for they shall forsake theyr carnal affection and endeuoure them selues vnto a more perfeyte lyfe / and so shall the oyntment of thy blyssynge descende vpon theyr heades.

And se that with all mekenes ye submyt your selues vnto the vocacion of god / not seking the lyberty of the fleshe / nether yet despysyng good workes / for faith doth mortefye the fleshe and her workes / & the spirite of god whiche resteth in a faythfull man helpeth our ins

               ¶ The power of faythe.
               The power of fayth is to iustefye vs: that is / to dispoyle vs frome all our vices and laye them on Christꝭ backe whiche hathe pacefyed the fathers wrathe towardes vs: and to endue vs with an others ryhtwysnes / that is Christꝭ / so that I and all my synnes are Christes / & Christ with all his vertues are myne / for he was borne for vs and geuen vnto vs. Esaye. ix. Roma. viii. To obteyne this ryghtwisnes god the father requireth nothing of vs but that we beleue in hym and make hym no lyar. He that beleueth that god of his mercye hath made vs these promises & that for his truthes sake he wil fulfyl them / he setteth to his seale yt god is true. But he that beleueth not or doubteth of this (as much as in him is) he maketh him a liar .i. Iohn̄ v. for why sholdest thou doubte in hym excepte thou thoughtest yt he were a lyar & wold not kepe his ꝓmesse which he made? Now yf thou counte God (whiche is the verye truthe) to be a lyar / arte thou not worthye a thousande dampnacyones.
            
            
               ¶ The worke of faythe.

thrughe fayth / then remembrynge the feruent loue of god towardes me I can not but loue my neyghboure agayne / for there is no man that hertelye loueth the father and can hate the sone / and althoughe the sonne be naught and unthriftye yet for his fathers sake he wyll helpe to better hym and euen lament and be sorye for y• sonnes wyckednesse. Lykewyse yf we hertely loue god for his infinyte benefytes done vnto vs / then can we not hate yt creature which he hath made after his own lykenes / whō god the father loueth so tenderly y• he gaue his owne sonne vnto the death to redeme him / yea & whom he hath adopted (thrugh Christe) to be his sonne and heyre. Nowe all be it we se no kyndenes in this man for whiche we sholde loue hym yet hath god shewed vs kyndnes ynough for the which we ought to loue hym & socoure hym at al tymes. Let vs therfore loue hym for y• loue that god his creatoure hathe shewed vs / & beare his infyrmitye / yf he faule let vs lyft hym vp agayne / and endue hym with our wysdome & all our workes euen as Christ hath done with vs / and this is an euydent token that thou louest god / when thou louest thy brother .i. Iohn .iiij. and seakest al meanes to helpe hym / these are the good workes that folow fayth / and are euydent

tokens that thy faythe is ryght and pure. Thus seest thou how good workes / flowe out of faythe through charite / & charite or loue is ye fulfilling of ye hole lawe. Ro. xiij.
