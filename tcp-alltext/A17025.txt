            To the Reader.
            
               IT is not vnknowen (Gentle Reader) what diuers and ſū
               drie commodities the diligēt peruſing, ſerching, and reading of Hiſtories, (I meane, the life and death of thoſe that before vs, good or ill, haue ben written off) bring to effecte, in thoſe that eyther in the good reioyce (as of God) or ſeing the euill abhor it, as of Sathan. As ſome reading of the vnſatiable greedie aſpiring myndes of immodeſt perſons, moſte looſe & deſſolute in lyfe, vſing in authoritie tyrannie, higheſt in Princes opinions, moſte obſtinate in Rebellion, yea in their higheſt pomp and pryde, ſeeing them by the leaſte winke of the ryghteous Iudge, come to ruinous, lamentable

and extreame myſerie, abhorring the ſame, forecaſt wyth themſelues the lyke extreamities: So agayne, others carefully noting the honeſt, good, and godly lyfe, of learned, wiſe, and graue men, in mynde meeke, in heart merciful, in office clement, the more Noble the more gentle, the more in authoritie the more obedient, ſeeing howe they by the vnſpeakable goodneſſe of God are preſerued and vpholden againſt their ennimies, perſuade them ſelues alſo to imitate the lyke. Yet ſome to the contrarie will happily ſaye, Hiſtories are Fables, many of ſmal authoritie, therefore doutfull, and ſome verie ſtrange, and ſo far hence done, that ſcarſe credible. Therefore (good Reader) I haue pende for thee a little piece of the bleſſings

of God to a Noble man, no ſtrā
               ger, but a neyghboure, a moſte faythful, truſtie and true ſubiect, that thou reading the ſame maiſt imitate the lyke obedience too thy Prince, the like regarde to thy Countrie, and the lyke reuenge to thy ennimie, that God maye bleſſe thee in thy vocation. This in parte diſcharging my duetie towardes my Lorde, and remembring hym whome a numbre ſhal miſſe, I wiſh thee health and happineſſe to Gods pleaſure.
            
               Thy friende, Rovvlande Broughton Gentleman.
            
         
         
            
            The Author to carpers.
            THou carping carle, thou thou that glad wouldſt catche
            A faut, wheron to fret thy foming fangs,
            Thou Momus thou, thou mayſt go peak a patche,
            And Zoylus too for al thy pāting pangs:
            He liues by fame, whome thou wouldeſt gladly bite,
            And ſhal for ay maugre thy curſed ſpite:
            And if ſo be my iuſt report thou blame,
            Truth is my ſhielde, and thyne ſhall be the ſhame.

               THe force of death eache ſimple creature knovves,
               Sage Cato gone, graue Tullie buried lies,
               In vayne alas, O England, are thy vvoes,
               For Paulets death, ceaſe of thy carefull cryes
               Though death by fate his aged corps haue ſlayne,
               In ſpite of death he liuing ſtill shal rayne.
            
            
               His vvorthies ſuch, O happy he the vvhile
               But by vvhat meanes heare Broughton he dothe tell:
               My Muſe too baſe, too ſlēder is my ſtile,
               In tearmes more apte he shevves it paſſing vvell.
               Thanke him therfore, for thāks he ought to haue,
               VVho makes men lyue vvhen they lye dead in graue.

            ¶ A BRIEFE DISCOVRSE OF THE lyfe and death of the late Lorde Marques of Wincheſter, Lorde hie Treaſourer of England. &c.
            
               
                  AS ſeaſon ſerue, ſo men applie
               to frame their factes aright:
               As day doth ſerue for exerciſe,
               ſo reſt belonges to night.
            
            
               The Sommers ſweate in tyme beſtowed,
               the Winter froſt defendes:
               And Winter doth for Sommers toyle,
               with reſtyng make amendes.
            
            
               That fertyll Sommers ſweat by care,
               right fruitfull doth extende:
               That ſame the barrayne Winter doth
               geue tyme to waſte and ſpende.
            
            
               Then Lent, as all tymes els I wiſh,
               to faſt and pray men hie:
               To purge their leperus conſciences,
               and Sathan to defie.
            
            
               To graunt and with the Prophet ſing,
               that all fleſh is but graſſe:
               And euery trée is rightly knowen,
               by the fruite from him doth paſſe.
            
            
               
               As I the twelfe of Marche, laſt paſt,
               theſe places did vnfould:
               Loe, in my Cloſet where I ſate,
               came in a mightie could.
            
            
               That troubled all my ſprites weake
               and did their vſe bereaue:
               My ſight, my voyce, my memorie,
               all in a maze tooke leaue.

               Or other ſuche from furious place,
               mée thought appéerd to mée.
            
            
               But that of mylder ſpeche farre muche,
               this whyle I mazed ſtaid:
               Mée thought he opened wide his mouth,
               and this to mee he ſaid.
            
            
               Canſt thou (quoth he) wt clowniſh cluche
               bée numbde, forget thy pen?
               Wilt thou vntyll ſo idle ſtate,
               tranſforme thy fingers ten?
            
            
               What hath bée witched late thy powers,
               whiche thou waſt wont to vſe?
               Or where is now becom the fruite,
               of thy acquainted Muze?
            
            
               
               Helpe now in dririe dole, now helpe
               to wayle a wofull caſe:
               His want I meane, whome all ye heauens,
               allotted to the place.
            
            
               If ſo that thou IGNARVS be,
               of that whiche is befall?
               As rudely as I can expreſſe,
               beholde thou ſhalt know all.
            
            
               And whilſt he dreſt hym ſelfe to ſpeake,
               no ſound he could ariſe:
               But all maugre his hart, he made
               two Cundits of his eyes.
            
            
               And in a ruefull ſorte, he ſayes,
               my Lorde, my Maiſter deare:
               Is ſommoned before the Throane
               of mightie IOVE t'appeare.
            
            
               And as he lyuyng ſtyll increaſt,
               By mightie IOVE his bownt:
               So now to IOVE agayne he is
               to render his account.
            
            
               Whom? or who? or whence he is?
               and of his pryme diſſent:
               Becauſe all dumbe amazde thou ſitſte,
               to tell I am content.

               The fifte of EDVVARD eke the fourth,
               that tyme in England Kyng alyue.
            
            
               At Fiſherton, hight DALAMER,
               
               this Subiect true was borne:
               Of worthy Parentes, as the ſtocke,
               had long tyme ben beforne.
            
            
               And at his byrth, the golden Giftes,
               that mightie IOVE could yeld:
               Diſcended from the Heauens aboue,
               his perſon for to ſhield.
            
            
               And downe vpon their flected knées,
               the vertues all do bende:
               Wtih eleuated eyes and hart,
               their praiers they extende.
            
            
               To hym that hath the power of all,
               from whence commes that we haue:
               That he their humble heſtes wold graunte
               and thus they gan to craue.
            
            
               Thou mighty God that guideſt the Globe,
               with Scepter in thy hande:
               That makeſt a footeſtole of the earth
               by whom all thoughtes are ſcande.
            
            
               
               Euen thou that doeſt the Chariot guyde,
               that ronnes the worlde alonge:
               Thou, thou, that doeſt vphold the right,
               and doeſt defende the wrong.
            
            
               Graunt that we may in eche reſpect,
               our powers ſo applie:
               Within this ſoule, that long he lyue,
               and ſtyll may worſhyp thée.
            
            
               Graunt that he may, a member make,
               anixed with ſo me might:
               To beare a ſubiect truſtie place,
               in furtheryng ſtyll the right.
            
            
               To whom the mightie Monarche he,
               that all the worlde did frame:
               Said, this was done before his birth,
               and PAVVLET was his name.
            
            
               And you that are my bleſſyngs too,
               I geue you charge to ſée:
               Vnto the ſoule, that by the fruite,
               the world may iudge the trée.
            
            
               Then ſtraight in ſpight of all that could
               fowle Sathan well deuiſe:
               Gods bleſſyngs ſtyll erected hym,
               to honour highe to riſe.
            
            
               
               When Ignorance with wilful minde,
               his vertue would diſgrace:
               Nay, nay, quoth Prudence, pack thou hence
               that lodgyng is my place.
            
            
               When lothſom lurkyng treaſon ſought,
               a harbor in his hart:
               Nay, nay quoth due obedience then,
               that parcell is my parte.
            
            
               And when VVLCANVS he that frames,
               the Thunder Bowlts of fyre:
               Came to infecte his modeſt mynde,
               with raſhe reuenging yre.
            
            
               Forgetfullnes ſupplyed the roome,
               as this my ſelfe can ſhow:
               Beſids a number of the léeke,
               that many mo doo know.
            
            
               Myſuſed much in ſuch a caſe,
               as few haue heard the lyke:
               When proofe was made to others ſhame,
               reuendgment this dyd ſéeke.
            
            
               A néedfull cauſe the accuſer forſt,
               his frindſhip to require:
               He graunted ſtraight to his requeſt,
               and more then his deſire.
            
            
               
               My Lorde quoth one, I muze to ſée,
               you entreate your enemies ſo:
               It mée ſufficeth my frende quoth he
               he hath the ouerthrow.
            
            
               O worthy mynde, that neuer lodgde
               reuendgement in his breſt:
               Nor in a wrathfull radge dyd let,
               the ſame to go to reſt.
            
            
               
                  PAVVLET quoth ha, within one man,
               
                  IOVE could no more contryue:
               For his vprighteous dealyng, I
               thought (Pawl yet) ſtyll alyue.
            
            
               But what of theſe, as many lyke,
               that would hym wring and wreſt?
               Iudge of the fruite, what was the trée,
               whiche God no doubt hath bleſt.
            
            
               And now to thée that haſte no power
               to ſpeake, as ſéemes to mée:
               Euen EX EPHEBIS ſure thou ſhalt
               his education ſee.
            
            
               From Scoole to Thaues Inne he came,
               where ſo he plied his tyme:
               That ſhortly to the Temple thence,
               his forwarde youth dyd clyme.
            
            
               
               Where he applied himſelfe ſo well,
               inclind to learned ſkyll:
               Tyll vtter Barreſter he was,
               he there continued ſtyll.
            
            
               And in Kyng Henrie his tyme, the ſeuenth
               in worſhip did increace:
               Beloued of his Prince he was,
               made Iuſtice of the peace.
            
            
               And then highe Shirife of the Shire,
               within the Countie of South:
               And in Commiſſions for the Kyng,
               commaunded by his mouth.
            
            
               And when that ſapient Sire was dead,
               whoſe wiſdome rulde the Realme:
               And left behinde that valiant Kynge,
               and moſt victorious Gemme.
            
            
               Henrie the eight, whoſe thunderyng voyce,
               all Chriſtendome dyd dreade:
               Who feared not the forrayne power,
               Gods Churche in trueth to lead.
            
            
               Who tumbled downe Idolatryes,
               and Pope ne Cardinall dyd
               Eſtéeme, that varied from the trueth,
               but their Decrées forbyd.
            
            
               
               By hym dyd PAVVLET worſhyp gayne
               as thou ſhalt briefely héere:
               Euen as it pleaſed God to bleſſe,
               ſo ſhall I tutch it néere.
            
            
               Firſt was he Mayſter of the woods,
               and next was Maiſter than:
               Of Wardes, and of the Lyueries,
               ſtyll thought a worthy man.
            
            
               And then his worſhip to increaſe,
               the Kyng dyd make him Knight,
               And then Controller of his Houſe,
               whiche ſéene ſo fit a wight.

               where ſo he likte the kynge:
               That ſtraight his highnes thought it good,
               to Honour hym to bryng.
            
            
               And of his priuy Counſell dyd,
               Sir William Pawlet make:
               Then Baron S. Iohn PAVLO POST,
               
               he dyd hym eake create.
            
            
               And after that Embaſſadour
               he ſent was into Fraunce:
               Where he behaued hym ſelfe ſo well,
               and had ſuche happie chaunce.
            
            
               
               That ſo the kyng his wiſdome wayde,
               and lykte his noble mynde:
               He made him of the Garter Knight,
               as in recorde we fynde.

               to hym had ſuch regarde:
               As to the lyke ſo deutifull,
               he highly gaue rewarde.
            
            
               He made hym then Lorde Chamberlayne,
               where ſo he ſerued the place:
               That Lorde great maſter was he made,
               within a lyttle ſpace.

               For iuſtice of an Eyer he was,

               On Chaſſes Parks and Foreſts all,
               on the hether ſide of Trent.
            
            
               Thus dyd this noble ſubiect liue,
               in iuſt obedience due:
               And whoſo euer liu'd amiſſe,

               Which proued well at laſt when tyme,

               To lyue, and long to raygne in peace,
               Gods glorie to aduaunce:
               That by her light, the Goſpell may,
               take place in Spayne and Fraunce:
            
            
               As doubtleſſe, by the hande of God,
               in ſpite of Chriſtes Foes:
               Her Grace hath well mayntaynde the right

               Within her raigne (O learned Prince)
               was PAVVLET by her déede:
               Thought fit to be a Counſellor,
               in caſe of doubt and néede.
            
            
               
               And by her Graces bountie had,
               the Office as before:
               Wherin he died in honour great,
               and many a thyng yet more.
            
            
               What warres were there within his time,
               where he or his were nat?
               Few or none I aſſured am,
               but he or his were at.
            
            
               As he a Subiect dutifull,
               fiue Kynges and Quéenes dyd ſerue,
               And neuer from the firſt to laſt,
               from trueth was found to ſwerue.
            
            
               So hath he childernes childerne left,
               who ſo to duetie bende:
               That lyfe and lyuing glad would loſe,
               their Prince for to defende.
            
            
               That he was bleſſed many wayes
               apparant may be ſéene:
               For by the fruite, what was the trée,
               a man may eaſelie déeme.
            
            
               The bleſſed, childernes childerne ſée,
               the Prophet doth relate:
               And he, his childerns childernes childerne,
               ſaw growen to mans eſtate.
            
            
               
               One worthy thyng, there is to note,
               in charge, the whiche he gaue:
               When his and childernes childerne came,
               his bleſſyng for to craue.
            
            
               God bleſſe you all, this was his phraſe,
               to thoſe that knéeled downe:
               I charge ye on my bleſſyng, bée
               obedient to the Crowne.
            
            
               For that the Kyng elected is,
               and of the Lorde appointed:
               And curſed is the man (no doubt)
               that frownes at his annointed.
            
            
               O ghoſtlie chardge, O godly man,
               that youth doth educate:
               In due obedience to their Prince,
               to lyue in their eſtate.
            
            
               Well, from this vale of myſerie,
               the lorde hath tane him quight:
               In better place (I hope) to reſt
               within his mercies ſight.

               In perfect ſtate of memorie,
               he cauld to God on hie:
               For mercie by his onely ſonne,
               and in this fayth dyd die.
            
            
               Whoſe lyfe, whoſe death encoradge may
               his iſſue to perſeuer:
               To treade the ſteppes that he hath done,
               in Fame to lyue for euer.
            
            
               Heare haue I now diſcourſte to thée,
               ſome of my Maiſters lyfe:
               But not the thyrde of that I could,
               for tyme doth byd, be briefe.
            
            
               If this ſufficeth not thy mynde,
               I thinke thou haſte no wyll:
               Or els fowle CERCES hath bewitcht
               thée of thy former ſkyll.
            
            
               Els (doubtleſſe) much vnworthy art,
               that clothyng for to weare:
               And as a Seruaunt to the Stocke,
               the countenance to beare.
            
            
               
               Yll prooues it ſurely by thy flouthe,

               For lyuyng not for loue beléeke,
               thou bearſt a Seruantes name.
            
            
               Wherwith the tutch of that in déede,
               the whiche in mée was not:
               I buckled to my anſwere ſtraight,
               and all my Mutes forgot.
            
            
               I ſaid: there is no cauſe, for why,
               you ought to blame mée ſo.
               For no man can reporte the trueth,

               his foes his friends to make:
               And their redoubled ſhames came on,
               as they dyd brew to bake.
            
            
               O wiſe and worthy learned man,
               when England ſtood at ſtay:
               For Ciuell wales or brutiſhe ſtyll,
               went with the thynge away.

               So ſounde, ſo perfect, and ſo true,

               and to ſuppreſſe a wronge.

               He geues long lyfe and happie dayes,
               and that none can deuiſe.
            
            
               
               Who méekely died in Chriſtes faith,
               whom death could not torment:
               But as a ſhadow vadeth, ſo
               the ſoule of Pawler went.
