            FIRST CONCERNING THE FIRST POINT OF THE Latine Fathers.
            
               The firſt Point
               THat the Latine Fathers works, (whereof diuers are already done) the books of Councels, and the body of the Canon Law, may be diligently reviewed, and compared with the beſt Manuſcripts; and the Collections and needfull obſeruations thence-from ariſing, printed; together with the pieces and fragments of the Fathers workes (if any ſhall be found.)
               Explained.
               
                  THat all theſe ten points are neceſſary and fi
                     •
                   to be enquired into, I take as granted by the confeſſion of all: that they are doubted by ſome, and plainely affirmed by others, whether within the time mentioned they may be performed, I know: and therefore I

as much in me lieth) endeuour to ſatisfie the one, and take away all manner of doubting from the other, with breuity and perſpicuity; grounding my ſelfe vpon good experience for ſome, and very probable reaſons for the reſt; following the order preſcribed.

I could be large in this point, but I muſt but point at, and not treat de induſtria of their wilfull corruptions, and make whole Iliads, or Chiliads of them: but that which is expected of me now I haue prooued, that there is good reaſon, and high time to imploy ſome to perfit that worke, which was happily begun, and left off (which I ſhame to ſpeake of) for want

of paiment. I was,

My body (I muſt confeſſe) is much impaired ſince, by much ſickneſſe; but on the contrary, my willingneſſe and experience in theſe buſineſſes, are much increaſed: and therefore I am perſwaded, that if Ambroſe, Gregorie, and Cyprian, may be, and haue beene done within a yeare and ſomething more: Auguſtine may be done in another, and Hierome in a third, and all the reſt of the Fathers in leſſe then a yeare, and the Councels and Gratian in a fift; whereof one, as I haue ſaid, is happily paſſed already: I doe purpoſe to imploy onely ſixe perſons, foure to the MSS, one to the laſt of the Proteſtants, the ſixt to the laſt of the Papiſts Edition; which both ſhall be noted in the Margent, and I will take vpon me as before, to be both Notarie, and Actuarie to the Company, concluding (as Bellarmine doth) if he be as true as his word: Si ſemel inueniar mentitus in uita, omnem mihi in poſterum fidem derogent.
               
            
            
               
               The ſecond Point
               That the Latine Tranſlation of the Greeke Fathers may be collationed by able and fit perſons, by reaſon of diuerſe Chriſtophorſons and Ieſuits, that haue too-too much abuſed the ignorant of the tongue.
               Explained.
               TOuching the ſecond Point, for the comparing of the Latine Tranſlation of the Greeke Fathers: I purpoſe not (vnleſſe it ſhall be thought fit by my Superiours) to compare it with MSS. Copies in Greek: we are left deſtitute of Copies, eſpecially now we are wholly bereft of all hope of helpe from the great Palatine Library: but (as I haue ſaid) 
                     Ʋedelius,
                  For a need I can giue them the places to be conſidered of, that are any wayes controuerted: almoſt all of thē before hand. and that worthy and thriſe honoured Knight and others, haue partly preuented, and partly ſupplied vs herein: that which I intend, is onely to ſuruay the Tranſlations in places controuerted onely, whether they be fitting and proper. A worke that may well be done, being diuided amongſt our Sages of the Greek, whether in, or out of the Vniuerſitie, within a yeare: though if they liſt to follow 
                     Ʋedelius in noting the corrupt Tranſlations, ſundring the Baſtard Treatiſes from the true a part by themſelues, & anſwering the places obiected out of the Fathers, with Criticall obſeruations, they ſhall deſerue well of the Fathers; it may, and ſhall be done for the Latine Fathers: as vve may follow Vedelius in the Greeke, ſo if no other will vndertake the worke in the Latine Fathers, I will doe the like in them, as Maſter Crompton hath done before in Saint Auguſtine.
               
            
            
               
               The third Point
               That the Jndices Expurgatory may be likewiſe peruſed, all of them, as many as can be gotten, the places forbidden to be tranſcribed, of which labour is a third part at the leaſt already taken by me, or my procurement.

                   For Alphonſus de Caſtro, I leaue you to conſider of that which hath beene ſtrucke out of him in latter Editions, in verbo Papa, concerning the Popes infallible authoritie, which true Caſtro doth deny to be ſo great as it is made; or that his perſon is inerrable, he thinketh no Paraſite of the Popes, or flatterer of the world, wil dare to auouch. For Onuphrius & others, I know what the learned iudgment is of that Author & others, & I know and all the world ſhall know how this Guadalaiara is vſed, or rather abuſed by the Papiſts, and forced to ſay, & vnſay, for ſeruile feare of the Spaniſh Sandouall, both againſt his wil, & the truth: it is the lateſt, cleareſt inſtance of their cunning dealing, to their no ſmall aduantage, to ſettle a wrong opinion in mens mindes about the powder Treaſon.

B. Clermond had done before vpon the Puritanes; caſting foule aſperſions vpon our State, as if they had plotted that which the Papiſts had acted out of a Ragionamento del Stato, or Trigo del Eſtado, or as Cleremond ſaith, to get their goods and lands confisked vnto the Exchequer, to inrich the Kings cofers.

               The fift Point
               That the Authors of the middle age, that wrote in the defence of that Religion, which is now (thankes be to God) publikely eſtabliſhed in the Church of England, for the ſubſtance thereof, may bee faithfully tranſcribed, diligently collated, & diſtributed into volumes, whereof many may bee made of orthodoxe writers; if not ſo many as of their Bibliotheca Patrum Probabilium: adding hereunto ſuch Writers, as being bred and brought vp in the boſome of the Roman Church ſaw the diſorders, diſcouered their abuſes both in doctrine and manners, and wiſhed almoſt for the

               Explained.
               THe fift Article concerneth the tranſcribing Authors of the middle age, a point wherein (if in any) wee may ſeeme to be defectiue. But quaedam videntur & non ſunt, ſtore is no ſore; we haue (thanked be God) ſtore of theſe Writers, that haue witneſſed the truth of our Religion, both in their worthy and ſolide writings, and by their glorious deathes. If they failed in any point (as ſeldome they doe) it was the fault and darkene ſe of thoſe times, the fault & number of thoſe baſtardly and beggarly Treatiſes, which euer ſince Vincentius Lirine

Hence it is that our Magdeburg Writers haue found ſo many naeuos and errours in the Fathers: but all of them of whom they ſpake and ſo ſharpely inueigh againſt are not Fathers, nor true ſonnes, but baſtard impes, it were well they were well rooted out all, both branch and bowgh, as Spuria vitulamina non dabunt radices altas.

Wicelius (as ſhall be ſhewed ere long) was almoſt wholly ours; it will not ſerue their turns to ſay as Harding doth, that he was firſt of our Religion, or as Gretſer (that neuer told lie in his life) ſometimes a Lutheran preacher. I doe not abſolutely deny it, it may be ſo, there is little written of, much by him: but in all his writings that I haue ſeen till of late, there cā be nothing gathered wheron they may ground this improbable cōceit. But what the? as for Weſſelus, he was not vnworthily called

               The ſixt Point
               That the Catalogus teſtium veritatis, compiled by Illyricus, may be rectified out of the originals, quoting Booke, Chapter, and Edition; and ſupplyed out of the vnprinted Manuſcripts.
               
               Explained:
               TOuching Illyricus, the Books printed, whoſe authorities are vouched, may be reuiewed by many; but for the Manuſcrips (as I would wiſh that all that are in Oxford and Cambridge, or elſe-where, may be viewed, qu

If I had no other imployment but this, wee two would vndertake that buſineſſe, and to doe it as it ſhould bee done, to no ſmall profit of the Church, and increaſe of Illyricus Catalogue of witneſſes of the truth.
            
            
               The ſeuenth Point
               That out of all theſe an Anticoccius may be framed out of Fathers, and middle-aged Writers, that were in their times eſteemed of the Church of Rome, and out of them onely: nothing doubting but we ſhall be able to match, if not exceed, his

two large Volumes, both in greatneſſe and goodneſſe; quoting as before, preciſely, our Editions, and doing all fide optima & antiqua, religiouſly and vnpartially, as becommeth Diuines.
               Explained.
               FOr the Anticoccius, it is already performed in a maner: I haue all the teſtimonies before Luther, and before or ſince of Papiſts, that prooued each Point materiall of our Religion, diſpoſed after a double method: the firſt of time, deſcending downewardes from Chriſt and his Apoſtles: the ſecond Alphabeticall, that I may know and ſupplie what is wanting, there wants: but comparing of the teſtimonies with the Originall: though I miſ-doubt them not,See Iewels defence and replie againſt Harding, and Mornayes reſp. à l' Eueſ

I know ſome haue challenged them, but the beſt is, they haue made their owne Apologies.
            
            
               
               The eighth Point
               That the ſuppoſititious and Baſtard Workes of the Fathers, noted by Doctor Rivet, or Maſter Cooke, or any other, may be re-examined; their exceptions ſcanned or weighed with indifferency, and other reaſons added to their challenge, if any ſhal be found.

               The ninth Point
               That the ſuſpected places may be viewed in the true Fathers, which are iuſtly challenged of corruption, either by our own men, or the aduerſary; with the like indifferencie of mindes, and vnpartialitie of iudgements▪ being compared with the touchſtone of the old Manuſcripts, and printed bookes, which are quaſi Manuſcripts.
               
               Explained.
               AS concerning the ninth Point,I haue moſt of the places gathered together in numerate.
                   a matter as worthy as any of our beſt conſiderations; there are a thouſand places challenged of corruption, (I ſpeake within compaſſe) moſt by Proteſtants, moſtly in the queſtion of the Supremacie, and iudge of controuerſies, the carrying queſtion: all which may be once well decided, either iudiciouſly out of the MSS, or coniecturally out of the ſtrength of wit or reaſon, and there is no third way allowed vs by the Criticks, all that I haue ſeene, and ſome of the beſt, it hath been Gods prouidence that I haue ſeene in my time, which may appeare by that, which here followeth; gathered together and diſpoſed into Theſes, for the better guiding of me and others, that ſhall buſie themſelues in examining or re examining theſe 1000. places, or more; ſuſpected or corrupted in the true Fathers.
               
               
                  
                  Theſes or Rules concerning the Art Criticke.

                      vpon Coniecture, or vpon Iudgement.
                  
                  3. Our Coniectures are vncertaine, for the moſt part grounded onely vpon circumſtances: Iudgement proceeds from the MSS, and is for the moſt part ſolide and certaine.
                  4. There are certaine rules and precepts to be obſerued in both.
                  5. Our Coniectures muſt be made ſparingly, diſcreetly, and warily,Parc

                  12. Bookes that haue beene tranſcribed within theſe 500 or 900 yeares, haue come into our hands very corrupt and falſe, as rightly obſerued Lud. Viues, and others: the corruptions came in, partly by the vnskilfulneſſe and multiplied abbreuiations of thoſe that vſually copied out bookes; partly by the boldneſſe and preſumption of certaine ſcioli; or laſtly by the careleſneſſe of Writers.

All which muſt be vnderſtood with this one exception, vnleſſe the ſaid bookes were diligently copied out and collated with the old and beſt MSS; for ſo being carefully done, they may be well nigh of as good credit, and ſtand vs in as good ſtead as the old MSS. themſelues, whereout they were tranſcribed.

                  15. Bookes that were printed long ſince, or at the firſt, when printing came in (ſuch as Cyprian 1471. or 1478.) are ſometime in ſtead, and aequalled with ſome MSS.

In collationing and comparing of old bookes with new, printed with the MSS, (a worke onely of induſtry, and properly belonging to our Criticks) as the antiquitie of the bookes muſt be regarded, ſo the number of the copies is to be well conſidered, and weighed in the libration of bookes.
                  17. As it is a ſure and receiued rule, that there Goulart. Annot. in Cypr. p. 582. Fr. Brug. Nouant. lect. p. 124

                  18. As the elder copies are to be preferred before the latter, ſo are the more to be regarded before the fewer.
                  19. If we finde a currant and conſtant reading in all the MSS, without any varying, no man may be ſo bold as to change the ſame, be it neuer ſo contrary to ſenſe, or repugnant to reaſon: All that we can doe in ſuch a caſe, i

How truly, the Reader may iudge by that which followeth. I will exemplifie them in two places, taken from one of the profoundeſt Schollers, and of deepeſt iudgement that euer England yeelded. The firſt conſiſteth vpon iudgement, the other vpon coniecture, the two legs whereupon the Art Criticke ſtandeth: My Author is the famous Bilſon Biſhop of Winton, whoſe learning was too great, and himſelfe too good, (as fooliſhly Norrice ſaid of him) to be a Proteſtant, and therefore hee praied for his conuerſion after the time of his diſſolution, I know not how he will anſwere this, he is not wont to be ſo charitable to others.

The Papiſts proue Tradition out of the one, and Norrice following Bellarmine, the Supremacy out of the other, but the Papiſts faile in both: the Biſhops coniectures in neither, and my confirmations (if any be needfull, or poſſible after him) are partly out of the MSS, and partly out of coniecture. Touching the firſt place, thus we reade, Conſuetudo matris Eccleſiae in baptizandis parvulis non credenda, niſi Eccleſiae traditio

                      Nifi Apoſtolica traditio eſſet for eſſe, is a ſcape in writing ſoone committed, but a matter of ſome moment in altering of the ſenſe. I take not vpon me to correct it, but leaue it to the indifferent Reader. See here an euident Argument of the learned Biſhops iudgement, and modeſtie: iudgement, or rather coniecture in gheſſing it to be corrupted, modeſtie in not preſuming to alter the reading vpon his owne coniecture, without furthet warrant from the MSS: for then he is bold to ſay, as he doth elſe where; Know ye that there are ſixe MSS. in the New College that reade thus. This place was (that I may ingeniouſly profeſſe a truth) it that drew my ſtudies to the contemplations of the MSS, and made me take a weariſome iourney to Cambridge, and elſewhere, to compile my Ecloga: this fiue and twenty yeeres at the leaſt, I haue beene conuerſant more or leſſe in theſe kinde of ſtudies, and ſome ſmall proficient I haue beene, nothing repenting me of my paines beſtowed, if they may profit my ſelfe and others, to the purpoſe. Anſwerable to the Biſhops coniectures are moſt, if not all of our Engliſh MSS: Quos Catholici maiores noſtri reliquerunt, (ſaith Poſſeuine) & thought to be as good as any are in the world beſides.
                  The ſecond place ſuſpected by the Biſhop of corruption, is taken out of Chryſoſtomes Ep. ad Innocentium, in theſe words: The word is printed 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

where he ſaith: 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        : i fore is eaſily ouer-ſeene, and yet in the matter the difference is much, though not ſo much, that it ſhould either helpe them, or hurt vs. And elſe-where obſecro vt ſcribas, the print or copie diſtruſted, the whole lettter goeth on with verbes of the plurall number— the whole petition made to them all. Now whether obſecro ut ſcribas, can ſtand with theſe wordes, libris veſtris▪ firms concedite, or rather obſecro vt ſcribatis. A verbe of the ſingular number thruſt in amongſt verbes of the plurall to claw the Biſhop of Rome.
                  This ſelfe-ſame place I ſent vnto a friend of mine, a Batchelor learned in Diuinity, to be farther conſidered of mee, who returned me this note thereupon. Bell. de Rom. Pontif l. 2. c. 15. § Septimo Bellarmines obſeruation out of theſe words is this. Chryſoſtome was vniuſlly depoſed by Theophilus Antiochenus, and hereupon writeth to the Biſhop of Rome, that he would be pleaſed by his authoritie to nullifie Theophilus ſentence, & to proceed both againſt him and his fellowes. Therefore (ſaith he) Chryſoſtome did acknowledge the Biſhop of Rome to be chiefe Iudge of Controuerſies amongſt the Graecians. Thus farre he Baronious is ready to daunce for ioy, that he hath found ſo pregnant a place for the Popes ſupremacie, and is of opinion, that God in his Diuine prouidence ſuffered this breach to happen betweene theſe two famous Biſhops, becauſe there ſhould a Conſtat as it were remaine vpon record whether we ought to go vpon the like occaſions: but by their leaues, both our Cardinals, haue committed many fraudulent deportements in the carrying of this buſiſineſſe.
                  1 Firſt S. Chyſoſtome wrote not to Innnocentius alone, but ioyntly to him and to his Collegues: This is proued by the tenour of the whole Epiſtle, which neuer ſpeakes but in the plurall number.

                  2 I was haled and pulled & carried away by maine force, the reaſon was becauſe forſooth I had appealed vnto the Synode] vnto the Synode, not vnto the Biſhop of Rome.
                  
                  3 He deſireth the charity and fauour of the Eaſterne Biſhops almoſt in euery place, and wiſheth that he might haue the happineſſe to come to their goodneſſes, and enioy the benefit thereof:] we haue therefore no acknowledgement of the Popes power of omnipotency.
                  4 If it ſhall be lawfull for euery one to breake or ruſh into another mans Dioceſſe, though from parts neuer ſo farre diſtant, & to determine what they liſt of their owne authorities, in ſhort time all things will come to nothing] He doth plainly allude vnto the Canon of the Councell of Nice, wherein each Patriarch (the Roman and all) haue certaine bounds and limits, which all men were bound expreſly to keepe. Therefore without all peraduenture Innocents authority alone (which he well knew) reached no further then his owne Dioceſſe: Further he could not goe extra regiones ſuburbicarias: that was not the thing ſought after, but the aide of an oecumenicall vniuerſall Synode, to determine this Controuerſie.
                  5 Beſides, Innocentius himſelfe elſe-where doth plainly ſhew, and as it were demonſtrate vnto vs a way for the compoſing of ſuch like Controuerſies, in his Epiſtle to the Cleargie of Conſtantinople, as we may read it in Sozomen, l. 8. cap. 26. Neceſſaria eſt inquit, &c.] It is not onely expedient but neceſſary, that the Biſhops ſhould meet in a Synode, about the determining of theſe Controuerſies—, for theſe ſtormes cannot be quieted, nor theſe tempeſts allaide, but onely

by a ſober and temperate meeting of Biſhops in a Synode] by a Synode onely, and not onely by the Sea of Rome.
                  
                  6 In his 2. Ep. to Innocent, thus writeth S. Chryſoſtome elſe where, — I muſt needs acknowledge, that your Fatherhood hath piouſly, (as much as in you lay) compoſed all differences, and remoued all ſcandals.— But they notwithſtanding ceaſe not to goe on in their obſtinate and wicked courſes.] Therefore Theophilus and his Complices or Copeſmates, nothing cared for Innocentius attempts in this very Controuerſie: but obſtinately went on, and fomented this Schiſme; Nathleſſe hee did intercede and mediate to the contrary.
                  7 The moſt and the vtmoſt indeed that Innocent could doe, was (which was common to him with other Biſhops according to the ancient cuſtome of that age) to deny all manner of Communion and fellowſhip with Theophilus or his Theophilines: this was not to pronounce him baniſhed from the Catholike Church, or to inualidate, or make his Acts of none effect by his bare authority and onely command. So here you haue a ſmall taſte of that fruit in both kindes of Criticiſme, which the world is to expect at our hands, if God giue grace and the Biſhops leaue:Reaſons why we ſhould vndertake the 8th. or 9th. Articles firſt. and I ſhould not thinke it much amiſſe or farre out of the way, if we did preſently goe in hand with this eighth and ninth Articles: of all others they are the moſt important, elſe in comparing the Fathers workes, wee may happily miſtake one for the other, or ſonnes for Fathers: And againe, who knoweth not but the worke of comparing the Latine Fathers works, the Greekes Tranſlation, are in ſome ſort inuolued and included in one of theſe two points, and theſe (to my ſeeming) may be well acted and peracted by, or not long after Michaelmas, only with the helpe of theſe twelue and ſome few voluntaries: prouided that we begin before the next, Eaſter as motus eſt in inſtanti, but I ſubmit and pray.

               All vvhich 10 Propoſitions, (needfull and important as they are) I doe vvillingly commend vnto my deare Mother the Church of England, and from her to the Cleargie and Gentry of this Land, to bee proceeded in, as they ſhall ſee it moſt expedient for the common good; promiſing nothing but my paines to bee commanded in theſe publique ſeruices. And I make no doubt (if God vvill) but that all this may be effected, vvithin ſome few yeares, if the Almighty giue grace, the rich whom God hath bleſſed with this worldly ſubſtance, incouragement;

and the reſt their prayers. Of the likelihood hereof I am the rather perſwaded, becauſe already by my ovvne meanes, and ſmall endeauours, there is almoſt a fourth part of the Worke done in all theſe 10 Articles. If one alone may do ſo much vvithin ſuch a time, vvhat may a dozen able Scholers (ſuch as I knovv and could name) doe vvithin 5, 6, 7, or 8 yeares, vvhich is the vtmoſt in my conjecture?

                   that I haue ſtudied this point more then 25 yeares, and petitioned, as I doe now, the Biſhops in the laſt Parliament of the late Queene, that I haue liued euer ſince in a place of ſome eminency for bookes; where though I could not well ſtudy them my ſelfe, but carried and ſometimes broke the bread like Silenus Aſſe, for others more then for my ſelfe, yet as one that ſtandeth vpon an high tower, to diſcry the enemy, may doe good ſeruice, though hee bee not in the Camp; ſo I ſtanding vpon this Pharos of learning, haue ſeen ſomewhat that it greeueth me to ſee, that books in time wil decay if the eſtate of the Church or Common-wealth, doe not preuent our Papiſts miſchieuous plots & complots, to pull Kings out of their thrones, and the King of Kings out of Heauen, if they may haue their wils, they are cunning Marchants, cloſe workers, all is in the darke, and in the vaut; I feare more their ſecret, then their open Indices: the truth is, I feare all, and beleeue none of them, I am ſo taught by D. Raynold, D. Raynold by Epicharmus: they ſow that now, which they meane to reape perhaps 40 or 50 yeares hence. I would gladly redeeme truth out of their hands, which is there not to be vſed, but ſuppreſſed, and to preſerue Religion entire, as it hath bin left vnto vs, & to preſerue it frō the iniuries of times and men, & who knoweth whether the great City of Rome be not to be aſſaulted and battered with theſe Rams? & the Man of ſin, that Antichriſt that exalteth himſelfe aboue God, or all that is called God, be not to be ouerthrowne and caſt downe to the ground, by this weake paper-ſhot of ours: I haue in Gods Name begun the battell in a good time, my bellum papale hath made a great and wide breach in their walls, my booke of corruptions hath touched them to the quicke, and drawne blood: but I ſhall re-enforce the battell ere it be long; experience hath taught me to vſe ſtronger weapons. I would haue them in Print, that the Aduerſary ſhould take no exception againſt them; or rather that hee may iuſtly obiect what he can, and when it is done, what great maſtery

is it to conquer a poore feeble man, whom age hath made old, and not ſickeneſſe, and God with the meanes of a learned Phyſition hath made ſtrong, contrary to all humane expectation. I muſt die when the appointed time ſhall come, it is good not to be found idle, or abroad out of my vocation. Non omnes poſſunt eſſe maximi. Sure I am I haue beene oftentimes buried in the mouthes of ſome ambitious men. I haue written, ſpoken, and done ſomewhat, when I might haue taken my pleaſure of the world, (as too many of my coat doe) I haue (thanked be God) no cure of ſoules, and yet am not ſecure or willing to ſay to my ſoule, take thy reſt: yet if my eyes may be ſo happy as to ſee the Epilogue and Cataſtrophe of this great buſineſſe, I ſhall ſing my Nunc dimittis with great contentedneſſe of mind, though I haue neuer a penny for my labour: they deſerue not (to my ſeeming) a reward for their labours, which labour for a reward. I ſhall finde ſome reſpect amongſt my fellow Proteſtants, and if it be but for my conſtant and vnfeined zeale: of the Papiſts, I looke for nothing but contempt and diſgrace: I haue taſted of this cup which my bleſſed Sauiour began vnto me, it is very bitter, ſaue that the wood of his Croſſe hath ſweetned it; I neuer offended any of them willingly: all my reading is in their owne Authors, are they offended for this? The proofes of my Religion, Truth and Antiquity are taken from them, is this that offendeth them? Nay I am contented, and fully reſolued to ſtand to the determination of the materiall controuerſies by their owne rules, and Iudges of their owne making, or ſome of their owne appointment.
               My bookes are yet vnanſwered, thoſe that ſeemed to be anſwered; here a ſentence and there a ſentence, I haue replied and reioyned vnto them: I am neither idle drone, nor wine bibber, or tipler, nor cutter and mangler, forger or counterfeiter of MSS, I will leaue that to the Papiſts, Hardings, and Poſſeuines of thoſe times, I will not offer to take their trade out of their hands. They thinke not ſo meanly of my ſelfe, as my ſelfe doe, yet as Iewell once ſaid to Harding,

I wold not aske longer time to impugne and expugne this New Troy, or Troynouant, I haue it vnder their hands, I haue made the beſt choice of the beſt and moſt able ſchollers that neuer ſued to me: I wil beare them witneſſe, but I will attempt nothing but permiſſu Superiorum.

                  ers, and open teſtimonies from beyond the ſeas, to incourage me to goe on cheerefully in the courſe of my ſtudies, and theſe from Papiſts as well as Proteſtants, ſome men of eminent learning, as well as Nobility, from the greateſt Biſhops within this land, as well as men of fame and name beyond the Seas: all this (as I ſay) puffeth not me vp, and maketh not me neither idle, nor high minded, I thanke them for their good wils, and am thankfull to the Almighty, if any thing be praiſe worthy in me, or bneficiall to others: but I account all this as nothing, and my ſelfe leſſe then nothing, if I doe not religiouſly pay my vowes, which I haue ſolemnly made to God and the Church in this kinde: and for a concluſion of all, to winde vp all, as it were into one clew. If the firſt Point may be well accompliſhed in three or foure yeares, the ſecond in one yeare, the third and fourth in halfe a yeare, the fift in a yeare or two, the 6. by two in two yeares, the 7. in a manner in a quarter of a yeare, the eighth and ninth in halfe a yere, the laſt within leſſe then a twelue moneth: when all is done, Quid ſtamus hic tota die otioſi. Once againe I am ready my ſelfe, and ſo are twelue more as willing in ſome ſort, more able then my ſelfe, to enter the liſts, and vpon the worke: if wee ſhall bee thereunto required by our Superiours, if our ſiſter Vniuerſity will ioine hand in hand with vs, we ſhall march the more confidently, they reuiſing our labours, and we interchangeably theirs, the worke will the ſooner and better be done, within halfe the time, by the rule of proportion. Thus I haue laboured in this Apology to ſatisfie others (for if I ſhould not do ſo much as in me lieth, I ſhould not ſatisfie my ſelf) ſatisfie all I cannot, my Superiours I hope I ſhal; if by no other, yet by this, that in the end I may iuſtly ſing my Io Poean,

Tutiſſimum eſt, &c. The ſafeſt way of all is to relie on Gods mercy.
