                  THe loue and care Wee haue towards the preseruation
of Our Subiects, and the keeping of Our Lande from
being polluted with blood; doth make Us striue with the euill
humors and depraued customes of the times, to reforme and
suppresse them by Our Princely policy and Iustice; To
which end and purpose, We haue by the seueritie of Our Edict,
(proceeding from Our owne pen, and by the exemplar censure
and Decrees of Our Court of Starre-Chamber) put downe,
and in good part mastered that audacious custome of Duelles and Challenges, and
haue likewise by a Statute made in Our time, taken away the benefit of Clergie in case
of Stabbing, and the like odious Man-slaughters:
            Wherefore it being alwayes the more principall in Our intention to preuent, then to
punish, being giuen to vnderstand of the vse of Steelets, pocket Daggers, and pocket Dags
and Pistols, which are weapons vtterly vnseruiceable for defence, Militarie practise, or
other lawfull vse, but odious, and noted Instruments of murther, and mischiefe; We
doe straightly will and command all persons whatsoeuer, that they doe not hencefoorth
presume to weare or carie about them any such Steelet or pocket Dagger, pocket Dagge or
Pistoll, vpon paine of Our Princely Indignation and displeasure, Imprisonment and
Censure in the Starre-Chamber; And We doe likewise straightly forbid vpon like paine
all Cutlers, or other person, to make or sell any of the said Steelets, pocket Daggers, pocket
Dagges or Pistols.
            
               Giuen at White-Hall, the 25. day of March, in the fourteenth yeere of Our Reigne of Great
Britaine, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the nine and fourtieth.
               
God saue the King
