            To the reader.
            
               THe firſt chapter of geneſis declareth how that at the be gynnynge whan the water was now in his place, God ſayde: Let the earthe brynge forth grene graſſe and herbe, that beareth ſeede, and frutefull trees, that may beare frute euery one after his kynde &c. Geneſi, i. And ſo it came to paſſe. Afterwarde vpon the fourth daye made he lyghtes in the ſirmamente of heauen: one greater lyght for the daye, & a leſſe for the nyght, namely the Sonne and the Mone, and made them to be tokens, and not to haue influence vpō theſe nethermoſt bodies, as the Philoſophers & oure pronoſticatours haue wrytten hyther to, Contrary vnto it yt god ſayeth

here, how that they ſhuld be vnto tokens, & how that the earth was fruteful or euer the ſtarres & lyghtes were made.
            Now where as they ſhewe any thynge yt is his doynge, and not theyrs: he onely doth great wonders. Pſal. c. xxxv. he couereth the ſkye with cloudes, he prepareth rayne for the earth, & maketh the graſſe to growe vpon the mountaynes. Pſal. c. xlvi. therfore are not they the cauſe of tempeſtes or ſtormes, nether of good wethers or frutefulnes in theſe nethermoſt creatures, whether it be in man, beeſt, or frute: but are tokēs only. For the which cauſe God doth oft warne vs in the lawe. Leuiti. xx. Deut. xviii. And in the prophetes Iere. xxvii. Eſa. xlvii. yt we ſhulde regarde no heauen gaſer, no beholder of ſtarres, nor ſoythſayer

               ge the tyme nor ye courſe of heauen wherfore me thinke it a fooly ſhe thinge, yt we are ſo afrayed where no feare ſhulde be, and that we regarde ſo many vayne pronoſticacyons. why do not we rather reioyſe, in ſo moche as all thinges are in Gods hand, and gouerned by Ieſus Chriſte. Muſte not all thinges be ſubdued vnto him. i. Cor. xv. Heb. ii. Can any creature of his, werke otherwiſe then he wyll haue it? Or how ſo euer they worke, do not al thynges turne to our beſt? No doute. Put thou thy truſt then in god. and be ſure, that as longe as he is thy frēde (which he hath promiſed to be if thou loue him & his worde) ther cā nothyng harme the: And as for the plages yt ſhal happē this yere vnto the per ſecuters and enemyes of Gods

               VUhan I loke well & conſyder the hy maiſter of ye ſtarres in his doctrine & writinge, I fynd yt this yeare and from hence forth vnto ye ende of the worlde, the Sunne, Mars & Mercurius ſhall reygne Now where as other mē ſeke their ſpeculaciō out of the ſtarres, that do not I regarde ſo much as experience in the doctrine of Chriſtē? And for the exhortacion and warnynge of all eſtates, I wyll deſcribe the nature and properties of

theſe thre gouernoures.
            The Sonne a myghtye Lorde ouer heauen and earthe, is Ieſus Chriſte oure only redemer and ſauiour, in al thinges lyke vnto his heauenly father. Pſal, ii. Io. xiiii. the bryghtnes of his glory. Sap. vii. Heb. i. the ymage of the inuiſible god: by whom al thynges that are in heauen and earth, were created: thinges viſible and thinges inuiſible, whether they be maieſties or lordeſhyps, ether rules or powers, Col. i, This Ieſus Chriſt the euerlaſtynge worde of his heauenly father, which toke oure nature vpon hym: Heb: ii. Phil. ii. & ſhe wed vs his fathers wyll, commynge into this worlde, broughte with him Mars that is the goſpell, euen out of the boſome of his father. But wonder not thou that The god is called Mars. I call the goſpell Mars. Chriſte

our ſauioure ſayth in Mathew. Thinke not y• I am come to ſende peace vpon earthe, I came not to ſende peace, but a ſwerde, for I am come to ſet a man at variaūce againſt his father, and ye doughter againſte her mother. &c. and a mās foes ſhalbe they of his own houſholde. Mat. x. Luce. xii. Michee. vii. Is not this a batayle? They ſhall put you to trouble ſayeth he) and kyll you, and of al people ſhal ye be hated for my names ſake. Mat. xxiiii. Therefore maye the goſpell well be called Mars.

                  oſpell. for where it is preached there is ye ſwerde, there is trouble and perſecucyon, there wyll the enemyes ſometyme draw theyr daggers at the preachers therof.
            As for Mercurius, the Poetes fayne hym to be the meſſaunger & oratoure of ye Heithen goddes, for

the whiche cauſe he maye well be likened vnto the world, which wt eloquence, painted wordes & outward appearance perfourmeth ye meſſage of the deuel, & entiſeth me ſo longe, tyll it brynge them into deſtruccion. But (as ſainte Ihonſayeth in his epiſtle) the world paſſeth away & the luſt therof 1, Io. ii And as S. Paule ſayeth. The faſſhion of this worlde paſſeth away 1. Cor. vii. Therefore muſte we ſo hold vs within the feare of god, yt we ſuffre not oure ſelues to be diſceaued or ſeduced by Mercurius frō the ſonne & Mars. Leſte we be corrupt with this diſceitful world & ſo be defrauded of ye ioy of ye euer laſting world to com: nether ſhuld yt paynted wiſedom of this worlde moue vs in ſomuche as god maketh it very foolyſhnes. i. Cor. i. & his worde (which ſemeth to be but

folyſhnes in the ſight of the world that ſheweth he to be onelye wiſedome and the very power of god, to the ſaluacion of as many as beleue theron: Roma. i.
            Who ſo euer now hath the grace to perceyue and conſyder this, let hym not go after Mercurius, let hym not folow the worlde and the beautifull luſters therof, let hym not entre in at the wide gate and brode waye that leadeth vnto deſtruccion. Mathe. vii. but let hym go in at the ſtraite gate, and at the narowe waye, whiche is euen Ieſus Chriſt. Ioh. xiiii. the only mercy ſeate. Rom. iii. & meane to come by the fauoure of GOD. By hym who ſoeuer entrethe, he maye be ſure to be ſaued. Ioh. x. to receaue mercy, to fynde grace, & to be helped in the time of nede. Hebre. v, whiche god the father graunte vs

for his ſake.

            ¶ The ſeconde Chapter, concernyng the increace or growing of frutes, and the dearth of the ſame.
            
               THe ſōne ſheweth playnly: that all ſoch as feare god, ſhall haue a verye frutefull yeare. Pſal. c. xxvii. & plēteouſnes in the dayes of derth. Pſal. xxxvi. In ſo moch yt though Chriſte ſende them without wallet, without ſcrippe & with out ſhues, yet wyll he ſo prouide for them that they ſhall lacke nothinge. Luce. xxii. For he ſayethe him ſelfe: The labourer is worthy of his meate. Math. x. Luc. x. who ſo nowe wyll laboure, ſhall eate. But who ſo euer wyll not worke, ought not to eate, ii. Teſſal, iii. Sturdy idle f

                   not eate. Now yf we labour, I ſay, we ſhall eate alſo. Yee but where ſhall we

get it? Chriſt our ſauyoure ſayth: Be not ye carefull for youre lyfe, what ye ſhall eate or what ye ſhall drink, nor yet for your body what ye ſhall put on. Is not ye lyfe more worth then meate, and the bodye more of value then rayment? Beholde ye foules of the ayre: for they ſowe not, nether reape, nor yet cary into the barnes, and yet youre heuenly father fedeth them. math. vt. He geueth meate to the yonge rauēs. Pſal. c. xlvi. he openeth his hande and fyllethe his creatures with plenteouſnes. Pſal. c. iii.
            Therefore though our handes we ought to laboure with oure handes and to caſt our take vpon the Lorde. ſhulde alway be occupied in ſome good laboure. Eph. iiii. yet ought not oure hertes to take thoughte what we ſhall eate or drynke, but firſt to care howe to ſeke the kyngdome of god. math. vi. & ſo ſhulde all thinges neceſſary be miniſtred

vnto vs. And why? Man, lyueth not, by bred onely, but by euery worde that procedeth out of the mouth of god. Deute. viii. math iiii. which thynge Chriſt our ſauioure hath manyfeſtly declared, in that he fed ſo many people with ſo few loaues & fyſſhes, lyke as he had done afore vnto the chyldren of Iſraell by ye ſpace of forty yeres in the wyldernes, where they wanted nothynge, for he hym ſelfe fed them, & bleſſed them in all ye workes of theyr hande. wherfore in ſo moch as god our mercyfull father taketh ſoch care for vs (.i. Pe v.) we ſhulde by ryght caſt all our care vpō him, & faithfully to cleue vnto his worde in our hertes, ſo ye we nether myſtruſt his godly prouyſion, nor leade an ydle lyfe. And yf we meane well in oure hertes, and deale truly with our handes, doutleſſe he ſhall ſende vs neceſſarye

meate by ſome bodye, as he dyd to Elias the prophete by the wedowe in Sarepta. iii. Re. xvii. and lyke as he prouyded a break faſt vnto Daniel amonge the Lions by the miniſtration of Abacuc. Dan. xiiii, Thus, I ſaye, they that feare god, ſhall haue plentye and aboundaunce of all thynges this yeare.
            But ſo farre as I can ſe or perceiue by this theologicall Aſtronomye, Mars threateneth a verye euyll and vnfrutefull yeare to dyuerſe ſpiritual prelates, as popiſh byſhops, & popiſh preiſtes, & other mo, except ye ſonne thorow his gracious influence be good vnto thē, although Mercuriꝰ reigne in thē with neuer ſo many horſes, greate pompe, auctoritie, riches, oppreſſion, with excedynge many ſeruauntes and dogges, which neuertheles

yf they wyll forſake theyr abulions and dyete them ſelues after the qualities of the Sonne, they ſhall be kept fro many dyuerſe ſur lettes, and haue a very frutefull yeare in all thynges. And ſo wold I councell them to do: for Mars goeth aboute now this yeare, to withdrawe from the ſpiritualtye the goſpell wyl reſorm the ſpiritualtye. the exceſſe of theyr frutes, ryches, and worldly auctorite (lyke as he hath threatened them this great whyle) & intendeth planely to reſourme them: And where as theyr whordome & olde cuſtome withſtande the furtheraūce of ye trueth Mars purpoſeth to take ye Sōne the goſpell wyll ſuffre the ſpiritualtye no more to vſe their whoredome. to helpe, and with the playſter of mariage to heale the infirmitie of their vnclēnes, yee and with his owne ſwerde of the ſpirite, to ſubdue theyr olde euell cuſtomes.
            As for the multitude of the vn

godly in generall, there ſhal come a great derth vpō thē, acording to ye wordes of a certayn true aſtronomer: Beholde, the tyme cōmeth (ſayeth the lorde god) that I ſhall ſende an hōger into the earth: not the honger of bred, nor the thyrſt of water, but an honger to heare ye worde of the Lorde: ſo ye they ſhall go frō the one ſee to the other, yee frō the north vnto ye eaſt, rēnynge about to ſeke the worde of ye lord, and ſhall not fynde it. Amos. viii. but becauſe they wyll not beleue the trueth and haue pleaſure in vnryghteouſnes, therfore ſhall God ſende them ſtronge deluſion, that they may beleue lyes. ii. Teſſ. ii ſo that the tyme ſhall come whā they ſhall deſyre to ſe one daye of the ſonne of man, and ſhall not ſe it. Luce. xvii. I paſſe ouer many other plages that Mars threateneth

vnto them, becauſe they wyll not knowe the tyme of their vtſitation. Luce. xix.

               THe Egipcians haddea maner and vſe in theyr bāckettes, to cary about an ymage of deathe, and to ſaye vnto euerye man that was at the bancket, Looke vpon this, eate, drynke and be mery, ſuch one ſhalt thou be whan thou dyeſt.
            And this they dyd (do doute) to put men in remembraunce of temperauncy and of deathe, leſte they vndiſcretly thorowe exceſſe of eatynge and drinking, ſhoulde happen to dye afore their age, for ſo doth god vſe to punyſhe ſoche ſyn: wherefore yf we dyete and temper oure ſelues thorowe the influence

               THe ſwerde that I ſpake of partly in yt fyrſt Chapter, is lyke to be drawen this yeare, for why, The Sonne, Mars, and Mercurius can not agre together. How accordeth the worlde with Chriſt & the goſpel? They ſhall neuer be at one Sore eyes may not abyde ye clare lyght of the ſonne, the lyghte wyll not conſent to the workes of darkneſſe, nether wyll ye beleuers haue parte with infidels. ii.

Thus can there be no agremente, for they be of contrarye natures. Agayne, a ſcornefull bodye (as Salomon ſayeth) loueth not one that rebuketh hym. Pro. xv. The chyldren of this worlde are ſcornefull. and therfore are they not contente The goſpel

Eſo. iii. And that ſhortly. For god hath put into the hertes of dyuers princes to fulfyll his wyll, and to hate ye whore of Babylon, to make her deſolate & naked, to put down her abuſions. Apo. xvii. & vtterlye to ſet her out of her ſtole. So yt it appeareth euydentlye, that ſathan ſhall no more haue ſo great dominion, as he hathe hadde in tymes paſte. And nowe that he ſeythe

that his kyngdome wyll haue a fall, he worketh (and ſhall do) al yt he can by the chyldrē of vnbeleife (ſpecially by the ſhauē Madianites) to ſtyrre vp warres, ſediciōs, ſecrete treaſon, and vtter defiaūce both amonge Princes and cominalties. For ſoch aduerſaries of the trueth had rather ſet all nacyons by the eares, and wyckedly to relyſte the ordinaūce of god in the auctorite of theyr Prince, then to ſubmyt them ſelues to the goſpel.

            THe influence of the Sonne and Mars declareth euidently by all coniectures (yee certaynly without any dout) that kynges and princes ſhall haue a proſperous yere: & me thynke I dare be bolde to ſaye the ſame, in as muche as I ſe that they begyn nowe ſome of them to ſeeke the true honoure of God, and to delyuer theyr people from oppreſſion.

And I dout not, but god this ſame yeare (by the faithfull miniſtracion of his auctorite in kinges & princes) ſhall brynge noble actes to paſſe, to the great deliueraūce of poore

people, and reformacy on of ye ignoraunt.

But yf thou do euell, then feare: for he beareth not the ſwerde for noughte.

            This daye is it good for wemē to be obedient & to ſubmytte themſelues ye we men obeye youre huſbandes. vnto theyr huſbādes as vnto the Lorde. For the huſbande is the wyues heade, euen as Chriſte alſo is the heade of the congregagatyon, and he is the ſauioure of his body. Eph. v. Therfore as the congregacyon is in ſubieccyon to Chriſt, ſo lykewyſe let the wyues be in ſubieccyō to theyr huſbādes in al thynges, as it is comly in the Lorde: Col. iii. yt euen they whiche beleue not the worde, maye with out the worde be wōne by yt cōuerſacyon of the wyues, whan they ſe theyr good lyuynge, i. Pe. iii. And let not theyr outwarde apparel be wemē ſhal not be to gorgiouſly arayed. with broyded heer, & hauynge on of golde, or in putting on of gorgious aray, but let the in warde mā

            This daye it is good for men to loue their wiues, euē as Chriſt ye men loue your wiues loued the cōgregation, and gaue hym ſelfe for it, to ſanctifie it. and clenſed it in the fountayne of water by ye worde, to make it to hymſelfe a glorious congregation, hauynge no ſpotte nor wrincle, nor any ſoche thyng, but that it ſhould be holy and without blame. Eph. v. So ought mē alſo to loue their wyues, euē as theyr owne bodies. He ye loueth his wyfe, loueth hym ſelfe. For no mā euer yet hated his

owne fleſhe, but noryſſheth & cheryſheth it, euen as the Lorde doth alſo the congregacyon. Therfore ought euery man to do ſo, that he loue his wyfe euen as hymſelfe, & not to be bytter vnto them, Coll. iii. but to dwell with them accordyng vnto knowlege, geuyng honoure vnto the wyfe, as vnto the weaker veſſell, and as vnto them y• are heyres with them of ye grace of lyfe, that theyr prayers be not let. i.

            This daye is it good for chyldren to honoure theyr fathers and mothers, and to obeye them in all thynges, for that is well pleaſyng vnto the Lorde. Ephe. vi. Coll. iii. yee the Lord wyll haue the father honoured of the chyldren: & loke what a mother commaūdeth her chyldrē to do, he wyll haue it kept Eccl. iii. who ſo honoureth his father,

his ſynnes ſhalbe forgeuen hym, and he that honoureth his mother, is like one that gathereth treaſure together, who ſo honoureth his father ſhall haue ioye of his owne chyldrē, and whan he maketh his prayer, he ſhalbe herde. He that honoureth his father, ſhal haue a longe lyfe: and he that is obedient for ye Lordes ſake, his mother ſhall haue ioye of hym: He yt feareth the Lord, honoureth his father and mother, and doth them ſeruice euen as it were vnto the Lorde hymſelfe. Honoure thy father therfore in dede, in worde, & in all pacyence, that thou mayſte haue his bleſſinge: for the bleſſynge of the father buyldeth vp the houſes of the chyldren, but the mothers curſe roteth out the foū
               dacyons. Reioyſe not thou whan thy father is reproued, for it is no

honoure vnto the, but a ſhame.
            For the worſhipe of a mās father is his owne worſhippe, and wher the father is without honoure, it is ye diſhoneſty of ye ſone. My ſōne make moche of thy father in his age, and greue hym not as longe as he lyueth. And yf his vnderſtō
               dynge fayle, haue pacyence with hym, and deſpyſe hym not in his ſtrength: For y• good dede yt thou ſheweſt vnto thy father, ſhall not be forgotten, and whan thou thy ſelfe wanteſt, it ſhalbe rewarded the. &c. He yt forſaketh his father, ſhal come to ſhame, and he that defyeth his mother, is curſed of god wherfore my ſōne, do thou thy deutye with louynge mekeneſſe, and ſo ſhalt thou be loued aboue other men. ye fathers brynge vp youre chyldren in the fear of god
            
            This day is it good for fathers and ſoch men as haue chyldren to

brynge them vp in the norture & informacyon of the Lorde. Ephe. vi. and not to be cruel vnto them, leſt they be of a deſperate mynde: Collo. iii. But diligently to teach them the commaundementes of God, for (as the wyſe man ſayeth) who loueth his chylde, holdeth hym ſtyl in norture and vnder correcyon, Pro. xiii. that he may haue ioye of hym afterwarde. Eccl. xxx. and yt he grope not after his neghbours dores. He that teacheth his ſonne, ſhall haue ioye in hym, and nede not be a ſhamed of hym amonge his acquayntaunce &c. An vntamed horſe wyll be harde, & a wanton chylde wyll be wylfull. Therfor who ſo euer thou be that haſt a chylde, geue hym not lybertye in his youth: Bowe downe his necke whyle he is yonge, hit hym vpō his ſydes whyle he is a child,

leſt he be to ſtubborne, and geue nomore force of the, (and ſo ſhalte thou haue heuynes of ſoule.)
            Teach thy chylde and be diligent therin, leſt it be to thy ſhame. with holde not correccion frō the chyld: for yf thou beateſt hym with the rodde, he ſhal not dye therof. Pro. xxiii. Thou ſmyteſt hym with the rod, but thou delyuereſt his ſoule from hell.
