            ¶To the ryght worshipfull syr Thomas Kemp Knyght.
            
               
                  Ryght worshypfull syr,
            
            whē thankfulnes had presented vnto mine eies the bookes: whearein the names of my frends are imprynted. I founde you for sundrye causes possessyng an high place thearein. Whearfore, though it fall not to my fortune presently, to acquit & discharge my duty: yet these, as certaine signe of my good will, to the vttermost of my small powre may grately you in the meane time. Which as they are (ye simple frutes of my small Orcheyard: the trauayle of my rude Muse) I

to the iudgment of the learned and dyscreate Readers. Wishynge to your worshyppe perfeete felicytye.
            
               From the mydle Temple. 
               Your kydesman: to commaund. T. Delapeend.
               
            
         
         
            ¶To the Reader.
            VNto the Iudgement of
            the wyse and learned, I
            Submit my paynes (to pleasure thē)
            perswaded thorowlye:
            That with aduisement they
            will speake, and reason ryght
            Shall rule theyr tongues, whearfore vnto
            syr Momus more dyspyte
            I gyue these same: that he,
            a whyle maye gnawe theron.
            To whet his poysoned rāckling teth,
            I cast the curre a bone:
            
               Lest that hee seeke to byte
            my name behynde my backe,
            To saye that here his verse is lame,
            or here good sence doth lacke.
            For I ofte times haue heard
            the vyle despysed sorte
            Blynd ignorantes, of worthie bokes
            to make suche rashe reporte:
            That when in order good,
            they could not read the same,
            They doubted not by slaūderous wordes
            the aucthors to defame.
            That learned men alowe
            these same, it shall to me
            Suffyse. Of Momes I do not seek
                  •
               
            
            commended for to be.
            Let them that no tyme spare
            to speake all that they maye
            To mee: and I will answere them
            right sone, at eche assaye.
            Theyr brutishe braynes vnfit
            to iudge of melodye,
            Their blinded wittes, & sences stopt
            do vnto them denie
            The vse of reason so:
            that monsters ryght they be,
            Despised dregges of men, to them
            in shape alone agree.
            
               Or els ryght 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
            
            and currysh whelpes they weare,
            Their iudgementes I do now dispise:
            theyr rage I do not feare.
         
         
            The Argument.
            THe mercye of God is merueylous:
            VVhich whē it pleaseth him to extēd
            On men, no wile so mischeuous,
            Can it peruert from perfect end.
            As in this worthye hystorye,
            It by a Duchesse maye appeare,
            VVhich faslye of adulterye
            Accused, is condemned heare
            For to be burned in a fyre:
            As then the custome did requyre:
            But God, which still defendeth ryght,
            From deathe hath her delyuered,
            By prowesle of a Spanishe knyght:
            VVhom afterward she maryed.

               Tolledoes famylyes:
            Moste auncyent noble gentlemen,
            and cheyfest lynes lykewyes
            In all the prouince theare.
            By worthy workes, theyr fame
            Was blowen aboute. All Europe then
            it dyd resound the same.
            
               O noble region Spayne,
            for frutes that fertyle soyle,
            And happy with the golden mines
            for which most men do toyle,
            O Realme more riche when that
            these houses did agree.
            O happy soyles whearein such men
            borne or brought vp they bee.
            Of both these famylyes
            ryght noble Gentlemen
            There were, but yet the lusty Lord
            
               Iohn of Mandossa then
            Dyd farre excell them all
            in euery exercyse:
            Most valiant, most actyue, and
            ryght polityke lyke wyse.
            He was beloued muche,
            of all the cōmons theare:
            Accepted for hys courtesye,
            with prynces euery wheare,
            As Pallas paynted had,
            his minde with lerned arte:
            Euen so dame Nature then, in hym,
            ryght well had wrought her parte.
            His lymmes were fyn
                  •
               ly framd,
            hys ioyntes so strongly knyt,
            That as the Simphonye alwayes
            doth please the eares: so it
            
               The gasyng eyes of men
            doth still delyght as muche.
            No paynter for his portrature,
            could pycture any suche.
            The Grekishe paynter myght
            an hundred graces theare
            haue seene, which erst in sōdry shapes
            he found not any wheare.
            And as hys shape did shew
            right semelie to the syght.
            So for his force he was well knowne
            to be a valiaunt knight.
            In auncyent hystoryes,
            his highe renowmed fame,
            Aduaunced hath vnto the skyes
            the glorye of his name.
            By space of forty yeares
            these famylyes betweene,
            For sondry causes then
            dissention great had beene.
            All stoute of eyther parte.
            they wolde in no wise beare
            Wrong vnreuenged longe wherfore
            small skirmishes there weare

            the other for to greate.
            
               But once, with Armyes great
            they met theyr myght to trye:
            By dynt ofswerd they wold discerne
            theyr matters by and by.
            And so, the youthly Lord
            
               Mandossa then did beare
            The rule, & charge as cheiftain stoute
            of all hys armye theare.
            Though to Minutyus

               For corage. Yet for counsell did
            not Fabius hym excell.
            When that his foes, he vewes,
            in glistring armour dyght.
            His soldiers in such sorte he doth
            encorage then to fyght.
            Behole my frendes, (sayth he)
            the tyme approcheth neare.
            This day, we must by māhode great,
            withstand our enmyes heare
            Our enemyes (sayth hee)
            how simply they be guyded.
            How rage rules them, & reason vs,
            how well we be prouided.
            Of armour good, and men,
            though not so many as they
            Yet such as do not fear, to spend
            their blood I dare well saye.
            
               Now, now, this tyme shall trye,
            if such as we appeare,
            We do acquyt our selues lyke men:
            to fyght with lusty cheare.
            Who wold not rather chuse,
            to dye, then liue with shame?
            As dastardes for to be despisd,
            to lose the worthy fame,
            Which with their blood before,
            our auncestores haue wonne.
            Shuld we faint hartes not folow thē
            
            to do as they begonne?
            What bondage is so vyle?
            what yoke so hard to beare
            As for to stoope vnto the foe
            and styll to lyue in feare?
            Our auncestours, with landes,
            dyd leue vs lybertie.
            Shuld we enthral our selues therfore
            for feare and doubt to dye?
            To beare the blot of blame
            For euer in our name.
            ¶Who lookes to lyue so longe
            in bondage for to bee?
            Can stomakes stout, of manlike men
            to seruyle yoke agree?
            O happy death, that doth
            exempt from miserye.
            
               The noble Romayne Captaines dyd
            not double for faine to dye.
            Are we not able now,
            to kepe the worthy fame,

            Loe yours we are, thoughe prest we weare

            Then streight the trompets sownd
            the banners be displaid.
            And thundring captaines voyce doth cheare
            such men as were afraid.
            The foming Steades do stampe,
            halfe mad to heare the sound
            Of drommes, the blowes on harnesse ring,

               Mandossa courseth them.
            with charged staffe in hand.
            No man could beare his blow so wel,
            nor yet hys force withstand:
            But downe to ground he goes,
            or through his bodie

               lydes

            he doth so rudely greete
            Them at the fyrst, that after, him
            they had no lyst to meete.
            His men, to marke that he
            his life did hazard so.
            their weried sprightes refresshed are
            and forewarde they do go.
            
               On euery syde, they laye
            aboute them with such myght:
            That boyling rage, wtin their brestes
            renewes their force to fyght.
            Then buckling by the eares,
            the horsemens sheylds haue met,
            Unto theyr tacle harde they stycke.
            and fote to fote is set.
            So valiantly they fought the feilde,
            And euery one was loth to yeild.

            A sister, sure a lady good,
            which for these thinges was sad.
            And then vppon her knees
            within her chamber fell,

            that noble famous towne:
            The duke of Sauoy his ancient seate
            whose wyfe had such renowne,
            For bewtyes lonely grace:
            that euery wheare her fame
            with worthy praise, had blown about
            the glory of her name.
            For as to Helen, shee
            was matche for goodly grace:
            Euen so her fame renoumed was
            as much in euery place.
            Dame Nature tried in her
            the force of all her art,
            I wrought by wōdrous worke, of her
            appeared euerie part.
            This Duches, syster was
            vnto the puissant kynge
            Of happy Ile, in Occean wyde.
            whose sacred soyle doth bringe
            In feild such valiunt men,
            and doth with plenty greate,
            Increase al things, which may for thē
            
            in any wise be meate.
            
               Deuided from the worlde,
            a world alone it is:
            Which of it selfe sufficientlye
            hath all comodyties.
            Norward, not farre beyond

            The spanish ladie now,
            to Thurin glad doth goe,
            To trie if fame the trueth hath tolde.
            and then, it chaunced so
            By fortunes fauour fayre,
            that as she entred had
            Into the Cytie, she espies
            the Duchesse fayre, Iclad
            With purple fyne, whose glosse
            doth glyster in her eyes.
            As do the beames of Titans sonne
            from hyghest of the skies,
            So that she doubteth styll,
            whether she should beholde
            The ladye bright with beauties shine,
            or her attyre with gould
            So gorgeous and braue.
            both do lykewyse delyght:
            But yet the beames of beauty fayre
            shyne clearer in her syght.

                  sabell,
            
            when she perceiued that,
            With fixed eyes beholding her
            as one that wondred at
            Some sight that seemed straunge:
            she standeth still in staye.
            The longer that she lookes, the more
            she likes in her alwaye.
            In mynde she doth commend,
            the sh
                  •
               pe of her alone.
            She surely thinkes, she neuer earst
            did see so fayre a one.
            She knowes her beautie now,
            agreing to her fame.
            And what she knows she cā not chuse
            but neede must shewe the same.
            The passing beuty, whiche
            in her aboue all other
            She vewes: makes her a matche to make
            the better for her brother.
            Whom much more teare then lyfe
            (good Lady) she did loue.
            And therfore to her companie,
            (affection so did moue▪)
            
               In Spanish tongue she speakes
            aloud. If God (saith shee)
            Wold grant, my brother might vnto
            this Duchesse maried be:
            Then might I well be bould,
            (and trueth therin) to saye,
            They were ye goodliest couple sure,
            in Europe at this daye.
            The Duchesse, which right well
            did vnderstand the tonge,
            Still passing forth, she marketh well
            the company alonge,
            All theare as they did stand:
            fayning as though that then,
            She did not vnderstand the speeche,
            nor knew what she did meane.
            But in her minde she thought,
            as she did seme to be,
            Some noble woman. And therfore
            she biddes a Page, go see
            Where shee will go to lodge:
            and shewe her, how that I
            Desire her for to go and see
            my Castell by and by.
            But as the Duchesse doth
            walke by the riuers syde:
            wher siluer streams twixt medowes greene,
            wt silent noyse do slyde.
            
               She museth styll vpon
            the wordes whych she before
            Had herd. And then into her mynd
            it runneth euermore.
            So tost in troubled minde
            she homeward hies in hast,
            To talke with Lady Isabell.
            
            and so she comes at laste
            With quicke returde agayne
            vnto her Castell, wheare
            She fyndes the Ladye Isabell,
            
            which taryed for her theare.
            And so due reuerence
            shee doth without delaye,
            Unto the noble Duchesse, as
            her better euery waye.
            And she ryght courteouslie
            Lykewyse doth entertaine
            The stranger well: perceiuinge sone
            that she came furthe of Spayne.
            She of her fortune, and
            her name enquyres also.
            She asketh eke the cause wherfore
            thys voyage she doth go.
            When that the Duchesse knew
            her byrth to be so great,
            She dothe excuse her selfe forthwith,
            that she with honour meate
            
               Had not receyued her,
            and putteth all the blame,
            On ignoraunce of her estate
            and place from whence she came,
            Then after much good talke
            of other matters so,
            The noble Duchesse at the last
            desyreth for to and
            Wherto the wordes earst of
            her beutye there she spake.
            And wherfore wt her brothers shape
            she first that matche did make,
            The shamefast Spaniard sayth,
            (with blusshyng at the same:)
            Whē that I sawe your beuty bright
            agreinge to your fame,

            the Spanysh Lady seene.
            For syth she hath begonne:
            Her worke must nedes be done.
            ¶She can not rule her rage,
            her race begonne to stay,
            Her fury doth enforce her furthe
            for to kepe on her waye.
            And so she could not rest,
            vntill the Spanyard, she
            Had promysed at her returne,
            with her againe to be,
            Then wishing her good spede,
            to God she leaues her so.
            
               And whylest the Ladye Isabell,
            
            furth on her waye doth goe:
            The Duchesse styll doth seeke,
            the meane, wherbye she maye
            Suppresse her flames, & quenche the fire:
            her furye for to staye.
            But styll the more shee stryues,
            more feruent is the fyre.
            And as the greater hope remaynes:
            the more is her desyre,
            Within her tender brest,
            suche force is of the flame:
            That shee, good Duchesse, could not longe
            endure to beare the same.
            Her heauye harte so sore opprest
            Did spoile her lymes of wonted rest.

            I knowe his loue is suche,

            To make an hasard of his lyfe,
            if such a neade shuld be.

               The Duke with them desires to here
            how that his wife maye doe,
            Whose colour in her face
            was altered so much:
            That shee appeared then as thoughe,
            shee neuer had bene suche.
            And they which her before had seene,

            And so when all they had
            consulted what they could
            With maister Appian they doubt
            what waye thearin they should
            Take. And at last they come
            the Duke vnto, and saie
            Twere best, yt for her soule he should
            prouyde the best he maye.
            The Duke be yond all mesure,

            Sendes for the byshopps suffragane

            She hopes, ere it be longe, in shrift
            with spanishe Lord to be.
            The Bishop in few wordes,
            with her had quycklye done:
            Her nature faylynge sure he thought
            that death was comminge on.
            The Duchesse gyues him thankes:
            desyrynge that he will
            Amonge his daylye orisons.
            her soule remember still,
            Then streyght the lustye Lordes
            and Ladyes do cum in:
            One doth bewayle her wofull case.
            an other doth begin,
            To gyue her counsell that
            to dye she maye prouide,
            And lykneth men vnto the flower,
            that can not long abyde.

            in frantike furyous fitts,
            To beate her selfe, and taketh on
            as shee had lost her wysts.

            To heare of him the duchesse streight
            as in a traunce shee stayes,
            She rules with vylage wan,

            When fayned prayers she,

            Two howres then beyng past,

            With strength she casteth furthe her armes.
            & plucks them in again.
            The Duke her husbande then,
            with liuely chearfull eye:
            With heauie hue leninge besyde,

            and addeth thearunto,

               These enter pryses rashe,
            and will you styll pursue:
            For gettinge how my lorde, the duke
            hath heare aduaunced you.
            Is this the Guerdon meate
            which you to him restore?
            And dyd he make you his
            Lieuetenant now therfore,
            That you vppon his bed
            the rule also should take?
            Is this the right discharge, which you
            of that same credyt make.
            Is this (I praye.) thallegeance due,
            Or seruyce of a subiect true?
            ¶I promyse you, that if

            These follyes. I will see that you

            to make your matche alwaye.
            
               I am your princesse whom you ought
            to honour and obaye:
            The Countie skooled thus:
            that lessen in his brayne
            Imprinted is so well, that it

            Disdaining much of her
            to be refused so,
            And countinge that the Duke therof
            at his retourne should know,
            His loue to deadlie spyte
            is changed. He alwaye
            Inuenteth sundrie meanes to bringe
            the Duchesse to decaye.
            And as he tosseth so
            his mischeife in his mynd:
            A polecye for him at last,
            the Dyuells grace doth fynd.
            He had a Nephue then,

                  •
               t full nyntene years ould,
            One of the brauest gentlemen,
            In Thurin to behould
            The Countye hauynge then
            no children: he dyd take
            This for his owne, and after him
            his onelye heyre to make
            So on a time to him
            my Nephue he doth saye.
            
               Thou knowest how that but me thou hast
            no other helpe or staye.
            And therfore for because,
            that God hath geuen to me
            No lawfull Issue now, myne heyre
            I haue appoynted thee,
            If thou canst haue the grace
            to folow so my mynd:
            Especiallye in thinges which you
            may for your profyt fynde.
            The ould vnluftie Duke
            is now from home afarre,
            And manie chaunginge chaunces still
            do happen in the warre.
            If he should chaunce to dye,
            as doubtfull is his lyfe,
            Tis possyble that you myght get
            the Duchesse to your wife.
            And so. God knowes how great
            Aduauncement it myght be
            To the. And yt wer wonne with ease
            (as it appeares to me)
            If that hearein▪ you would
            my counsell well obey.
            Thought to the poynt of maryage,
            it maye not com strayght waye,
            Yet sure, you shall not fayle
            a frend of her therby.
            
               To haue. By many sundrye thinges
            ere this, I did espie:
            She bare thee much good will
            and neuer durste before
            Let it besene. Wherfore do thou
            stycke stoutlye euermore
            Hearto. And take the hap,
            whatsoeuer it do cost:
            Do what you can to please her styll
            it is no labour lost.
            Seke all the meanes ye maye,
            To serue her euery waye.
            ¶And tyme shall teache you well
            at last, the same to see:
            Which youth 
                  •
                want of skill till now
            hath hid alwayes from the.
            This symple youthe beleues
            his on
                  •
               les wretched wyles.
            The craftye Fowlers pype full sone
            the selye byrde beguyles,
            He thinkes that all is Gould
            that glystreth to the eye.
            The Tutcstone of experyence
            he wantes the same to trye,
            He dothe begin: about
            the Duchesse, for to be
            Alwaies. And shamfastlie by sygnes,
            he mours her so to see:
            
               How he with willynge mynde
            To serue her was enclynde.
            ¶Whice when he had obserued,
            a monthe or twayne lyke wyse:
            The gentle Duchesse at the last
            his dylygen
                  •
               e espyes,
            And honesse seruyce whyche
            wyth earnest zeale, he had
            Done her of late. And so therfore
            the Duchesse, she was glad
            To fauoure hym the more,
            prefarrynge hym aboue
            The other pages. And therto
            his comlye grace doth moue
            The more. Of wantonnes
            proceaded not her loue.
            For his good seruice don to her:
            She dyd hym onelye so preferre,
            ¶But now the vncle false
            none other thinge dothe he:
            But longeth of the Duchesse styll
            auenged for to be.
            And thynkynge now for all,
            at double or quyte to playe:
            He calles his Nephue once agayne,
            and in this sorte doth saye,
            I see, that now thou art
            the hapieste man alyue:
            
               If you can take the lucky lot,
            as fortune doth it geue,
            Not onelye great good will,
            the Duchesse beares to the:
            But now with seruent loue, to syght
            consumed much is she.
            But wemen, (as ye see)
            They sumwhat shamfast be.
            ¶They loue to be desyred
            in secret place alwaie.
            A certaine force doth please thē well.
            as thoughe constrayned they
            Do yeald, and graunt to that
            whyche they ryght glad and fayne
            Would offer: If a lytell shame
            dyd them not still restraine.
            Be barbie then sayth he,
            this to beleue thearfore.
            For I haue proued and found it true,
            ryght often heare to fore,
            And that before this time
            tomorowe, thou shalt saie,
            Thy selfe to be the happiest man,
            that lyues on earth this daye.
            And thearfore now I would
            sumtime, ye should espye,
            Unto the Duchesse chamber soone,
            to goe ryght priuely.
            
               Under her bed also,
            thy selfe thear must thou hyde,
            Tyll after mydnight past an howre
            at least still to abyde.
            And when she dothe begyn
            in depest sleape to fall:
            From vnderneath the bed,
            aryse furthwith you shall,
            And brauely commynge to
            her hed, you shall declare
            That loue dyd cause your comminge theare
            & tell her who you are.
            So be you sure of thys
            what for her feruent loue,
            And absence of the Duke so longe:
            both these lykewyse wyll moue
            Her, then in foulded armes
            Most louynglye tembrace
            The sone, & chear thy hart with ioyes
            of louers sweete solace
            The sely youth beleues
            his vncles wordes streyght waye
            Supposinge that the Duchesse might
            perswade him so to say.
            Him selfe dyd thinke no hurte
            and therfore doubtes no vil,
            And so his vncles traytrous mynd
            furthwyth he doth fulfyll.
            
               For then the Countye was
            obayed as a kynge,
            And honoured euen as the Duke
            him selfe in euerye thinge.
            Before that mydnyght came.
            the traytour false in doubt,
            Lest that his shamfull vylanye
            myght be espyed out,
            Thre of the counsell, with
            sum of the garde also
            He takes, and to the chamber of
            the Duchesse streyght doth goe.
            Wheare knockynge at the dore,
            he willeth then to saye,
            The Duke was cum and so, the dore
            was opeded wyde straight waye.
            With naked swerd in hand
            the Countye rushethe in,
            And ragynge lyke a man out of
            his wittes he doth begin
            To pray on euerye syde,
            the chamber rounde about.
            And so, from vnderneath the bed
            at last he pluckethe out
            His Nephue all amasd,
            and tremblinge then for feare:
            Lyke as the lambe which yet alyne
            the rauenynge wolfe doth teare.
            
               To whom denyeng power
            one word at last to saye:
            Hee thrustes him through y• throt & thē
            
            wt dobled stripe, streghtway
            He strykes hym in the brest,
            that he myght quyckely lose
            His breath, & be without the power,
            his treason to desclose.
            And now poore innocent,
            vpon the ground he lyes
            His limmes being stiffe, his striuing lyfe
            dothe yeald to destinyes.
            ¶His blade with blood embrewe,
            the Countye putteth in
            His sheath againe. And thus dothe to
            the counsellers begyn.
            My frendes (sayth he) this same
            was not fyrste tyme, that I
            The wanton and vnhonest loue
            betwens them dyd espye.
            But now at last, I found
            a tyme the truth to trye,
            But yet this gloton heare, I made
            to fayre a death to dye.
            For his desert requyres,
            by rygour of the lawe:
            That horses wyld, in quarters shuld,

               As for my Ladye heare,
            the Duchesse, at this tyme
            I traue. I can no punyshment

            But for the allegeance of
            my dutye, which I owe
            Unto my Lorde the Duke, I wyll

            In sondry raginge fyts as she

            Or god which doth the trueth well know
            shall send her sum releife.

            restes not by nyght or daye:
            But thinketh on the Duchesse and
            her woefull case alwaye.
            At last him selfe dothe see,
            that hee vnworthy weare:
            The worship of a knight to haue
            or noble armes to beare:
            If he for feare, to helpe
            the afflycted shoulde denie,

            And with him selfe by thys, at last
            so much he doth preuaile.
            That he disheryted,
            to dye wolude rather chose
            In honour, then to liue longe tyme
            and his good name to lose
            
               For want of corage, so
            remembringe with the same
            How that in hys prosperitie
            to hym the Duchesse came.
            How can I now (sayth he)
            forsake her in her woe?
            Ten deathes to dye, more lefe had I

            With horse and harnesse good:
            as anye man myght neade.
            And so aryued at Thurin, he
            enquyred theare with speade,
            If anye Spanyardes be
            in towne. And so he heares
            But of one olde relygious man,
            which theare this twenty yeares
            Had ben. An holie man,
            and eke beloued well,
            Of all the Cytezens. Whych then
            without the towne did dwell
            Alone, in cottage lowe,
            that he might so eschew,
            The loue & lust of worldly thinges,
            his flesh for to subdew.
            
               Such is relygious lyfe,

            as farre as we could see,
            She hath bene euermore
            a Princesse good and iust.

            The comfort to the comfortlesse,
            the wearye bodies rest.
            To them in darknes▪ he
            doth giue the louelie light.
            Repose your hope in him. Make him
            your Champyon for to fight.
            The persecuted poore,
            (Saint Mathew sayth:) they bee
            The blessed ones, which shal of heauē
            
            the happie kyngdome see.
            
               And with his godlie talke
            when that the knight had done:
            The Duchesse was so rauished
            in contemplacion,
            That then her soule, should seeme
            to tast immediatlye
            Of ioyes deuine, & would furthwyth
            from out her bodie flye.
            Shee feeles her selfe euen then
            to be aledged so,
            As one in daunger great of late
            escaped had thearfro.
            And then shee doth confesse
            her mynde and nothinge leaue
            Behinde, which she remembred then
            her coscience to greaue.
            But then at last vnto
            her accusation shee
            Doth saye. I will not aske my God,
            absolued for to bee,
            For anie cryme in deede,
            or thought: against the right
            Of maryage, excepted this
            that to a spanishe knight,
            Once heretofore, (I wote)
            I was affected so:
            That fayning for deuocion,
            to see him I did goe.
            
               Wythout that euer he
            had any thynge of mee:
            Saue that good will alone, whearin
            to him I did agree.
            Whearfore my God displeasd,
            hath suffred nowe, I see,
            These accusations false on me
            so lewdlye layde to be:
            But seynge that it is his will.
            I houlde my selfe contented still.
            ¶When in this sorte, all her
            confession was done:
            A Diamond ryche from finger fayre,
            she draweth of anon,
            And sayth, fayre father I

            But all my goodes, and Iuels now
            from me are taken cleane,

            the kynge my brother gaue

            and for because I haue
            No other meanes to do
            you good: I geue you this.
            And kepe it wel, you know not what
            the valewe of it is.

            good father I espy:

            accused wrongfully.
            The Coūty (Traitour vile) wt shame

            And therfore now, I am
            determined to fyght,
            Untill last breath of all my lyfe,
            for to defende her ryght.
            I feele my selfe at harte,
            to be attaynted so,
            That longe me thinkes the time, tyll to
            the purpose I may go.
            Wherfore, if I do fayle

            After that I am slayne, let me
            be knowen abrode strayght waye

            And knockyng at the gate
            with thuneryng voyce doth saye

            These newes are blowen about
            the Citie by and by:
            And all the paryshe churches full
            of folkes, one might espye,
            Which for their Ladie, now
            to God on high do praye.
            So whilst this ambassage was done,
            
               Mandozze rydes his waye,
            On lustie fomynge steade
            vnto the Piller wheare,
            The accusation written was,
            and so, abydeth theare
            To see Thaccuser come.
            but whē the Countie this doth kno
            Remorse of conscience
            doth pynche & prycke him so:
            That in his mynde he did
            endure such preuie payne,
            That then repentyng him he would
            haue ben right glad and fayne,
            The deede had ben vndone.
            and dayntie for to fight.
            
               He seketh still delayes, and fyrste
            vnto the Spanishe knight,
            He sendes a messenger.

               toutly sayth,
            he shall not knowe the same.
            But sure for all the rest,
            what power in hym doth lye,
            He shall it know and fecle forthwith,
            if then he lyste to trye.
            The Iudges theare also,
            affyrmed in the same:
            How that their statutes do not bynde
            him for to shew his name.
            And further in the case,
            the Lawyers all do saye:
            How that thaccused partye ought
            to see the fyght alwaye.
            And reason yelde, not for
            because theyr bookes so be:
            But in Fauorem vitae was
            the cause of that decree.
            Which when the Countie heares
            althoughe he dyd dystrust
            His parte: yet of necessitie
            make manhode now he must.
            And beinge vsed to
            suche skirmishes before.
            
               He armes him selfe forthwith
            and feareth lesse therfore
            And settynge vp his brystels then,
            lyke as the forest Bore:
            Unto thappoynted place
            he comes, and theare doth see
            His foe in Armoure blacke
            well harnessed to be,
            In sygne of combate then.
            he semes alustie knyght.
            And brauelye prauncyng vp & downe
            he feareth not to fyght.
            So then the Duchesse fayre
            was sent for out of hand:
            Whiche is not sorye sure inoughe
            these newes to vnderstand.
            Yet in her ioyfull mynd,
            alwayes much museth shee,
            Frō whēce thunhoped help doth cum,
            or who that knyght should bee,
            That then had promised
            to do so muche for her.
            So she is caryed to the feyld
            within an horselytter,
            Beyng couered with tylt
            of Blacke. Accompanyed
            With number great of Ladies sayre
            and damsells by her syde,
            
               Attired all in blacke.
            they bryng her to the place
            Whear as the people, & the knightes
            did tarie for her grace.
            Thus then shee mounted is
            vppon a litle stage:
            Sreight waye the Iudges which the fell▪
            
            appointed weare to gage,
            Demaund of her sith that
            she is accused by
            The Countie Pancalyer, as gyltie
            of adulterie,
            And sith the custome is,
            that you a champion maye
            Prouide, bi fight, to proue your right
            Within a yeare and daye,
            How saye you now thearfore,
            Madame, do you agree
            By this same knight your innocence
            approued nowe maye be?
            Will you that on his force
            alone your right shall lie?
            If you by him wyll wage your lawe,
            your fautlesse truth to trye,
            Speake now what you thinke best,
            And theare on shall the issue rest.
            ¶The Duchesse answereth,
            I do repose my ryght
            
               In God which knowes the same, & in
            the manhode of the knight.
            To him my cause cōmit do I:
            Indifferent to liue or dye.
            ¶But tost in troubled mynde,

            A stranger neuer knowne to her:
            sum captaine stoute should bee.
            So on her knees she falles,

            in throne aboue the skies,
            Thou knowest the truthe vntryed.
            O Lorde maintaine my part.
            Pleade thou my cause, for yu doest see
            the secretes of my hart.

            that anie man can hyde
            But vnto thee discouered,
            the same is well espied.
            Let not this tyrant fearce
            which thriffes my blood to spill,
            Triumphe on my simplicitie.
            confound him in his will.
            O Lorde which thy poore flocke,
            from Wolues defendest still:
            Let not this blooddy butcher nowe
            thy selie Lambe heare kyll.
            
               O Lorde looke downe at laste,
            turne not awaye thy face
            From sinners poore, Bestow on me
            the tresure of thy grace.
            Thou seest my innocence
            thou knowest the payne and smart
            That I endured hope, to thee,
            I do commit my part.
            As Hester thou didst helpe
            when shee did make her mone:
            So Lord helpe mee for why my hope
            remaynes in thee alone
            As Susan fayre, thou didst
            delyuer in her woe.
            And Iudith from the myghty hand
            of Holoferne also:
            From this same Centaure fearce,
            saue me (O Lorde) I praye:
            Which of myne honour so dyd seeke,
            to beare the spoyle awaye.
            And then with fixed eyes,
            shee still behouldes the ground
            With looke amased staryng lyke
            as shee weare in a sounde.

            do now most playnlie see,
            Thy accusacion agaynst
            this Pryncesse, falce to bee.
            Inuented for dispite,
            most wicked man alyue.
            And as I saye the truth of it,
            so God graunt me to thryue.
            And that thou her belyest
            I will the same mayntayne.
            Euen in thy hart, right falslye thou
            this vylanie didst fayne.

            and this which I do saye:
            By force in fight, I will

            Thy wicked breath infectes the ayre,
            thy lyfe offendes the skye.
            The light doth loth thy looke.
            tis time for thee to dye.
            But now by dint of swerd with thee,

            whom no man doth esteeme,
            And therfore, with dispite
