            TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL IOHN DACKHAM ESQVIRE, ONE OF the Masters, of Requests to the most Mightie, IAMES, King of Great Britaine.
            
            
               SIR,
            
            
               EVER SINCE, through your fauour, I haue had accesse, vpon occasions, vnto your house: And hauing seene the religious ordor, which you obserue in

the course of your diuine exercise of prayer with your people; I haue studied to giue some testimony of my thākfulnesse; that you were pleased to admit me an often partaker of the same with you: as also of your immerited fauours, in many other kindes, not being able to recompēce the least of them. Now, to shew my selfe in some measure mindfull that I owe you thankfulnesse; I am bold to leaue with you this silly pawne, the Pensiue Soules Delight, consisting of Motiues vnto, and Prayers for diuine purposes, to stirre vp such as haue any holy desire to that most sweet exercise: for, in

nothing doth true godlines shew it selfe more, then in faithful prayer, with the sincere practise of a holy life. And no action produceth more solide comfort, in all occasions of the hearts heauines, then doth the practise of true prayer, and supplication in the spirit to God, who is more moued therby, then with any other, whatsoeuer, sacrifice of man: and the neglect of this most holy duetie, is more inexcusable, then any other diuine action whatsoeuer. Euery man cannot giue almes, by reason he wanteth the meanes; yet may he Pray: many godly duties may be omitted by necessitie:
               
but Prayer neuer: nothing pleaseth God more, nor appeaseth him sooner then Prayer. And nothing more woundeth, and resisteth that spiritual enemie, then it. And that maketh him seeke, and execute all meanes, to preuent, peruert, & hinder it. As long as a māliueth carelessely, carnally, and sencelesse of the necessitie of this diuine duty, Satā
                neuer trobles him; he is at peace with him: but let him begin to addresse himselfe to God in Prayer; then wil that subtile Serpent thrust in a thousand opposite thoughts, to crosse his holy intention. Prayer is a most ir
                     •
                  
                  some exercise to Satan: he neuer

hath or wil permit a man truely to serue God, but hee will peruert his will and holy affections, as much as in him lieth: and therefore must euery man that wil liue in this sacred seruice of God, arme himselfe to the combate, as euery true childe of God well knoweth by experience. The reading of proph
                     •
                  ne bookes, gaming, surfeting, drunkennesse, whoredome, corporall, and carnall delights, and worldly affaires, passe without breach of league with Satan; neyther troubleth it the minde of the secure man. But Prayer so farre troubles and disquiets the Serpent, that he roares like a Lion against it;

which argueth Prayer to bee the onely and safest defence against Satan and Hel, and the vanities of this life to be the weapons which mortal men beare, and vse to fight for S
                     •
                  
                  tan against God. A fearefull condition it is to bee bewitched with these corporall, carnal and worldly inchantments, which so possesse the hearts and soules of such as neglect Prayer, as they are alreadie dead in their soules, being yet aliue in their bodies; they are alreadie partakers of that blacke and infernall darknesse heere, onely weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth, futurely attend them. Happie therefore is

that man, and happie is that family, that haue the holy exercise of prayer in continuall vse, though in continuall warre with Satan, and his Angels, and instruments. It is frequent in your family, let no worldly occasion discontinue it. It seasoneth all your actions, and maketh them acceptable to God, helpfull to men, & profitable to your selfe. God hath giuen you a rich taste of his blessings: let him still smell that sweete sauour of your continuall supplications and thankfulnes, which you haue begun: you runne well, continue to the end. Looke not back, lest you lose the rich prize you first

aimed at, for a vanishing shadow, that will flie from you, and faile you, when you come to your race end. I need not aduertise you, that there are in euery man two cōtrarie substances, the Soule, and the Bodie: and that euerie man is euen so capable of two contrary and incompatible pleasures, the spirituall and the carnall; and so farre as doth the substance, so far doth the pleasure of the soule exceed that of the bodie, which being but a painted and temporarie pleasure, is neuer desired of those that are truely acquainted with the delights of the soule, which are eternall. Thus I

write (Right worshipfull) not to teach you, but as a louing Prompter, to put you in minde of your first loue to him that loued you first: loue him and serue him still and hee will blesse you still; and so I wish, in him, whom he loueth best, Christ, our common Sauiour and Redeemer.

               Seeke the Lord while hee may bee found, call vpon him while he is neere.
               Esai. 55. 6.
            
            
               THere are three things, especially to be considered in the true seeking & calling vpon God: The first is Preparation before we call vpon God in prayer: The second is Attention in Prayer: The third and last is, Thanksgiuing after prayer.
            
               Preparation to Prayer.
               As touching the first, namely, preparation, we may obserue and

vse a kinde of imitation of men, occasioned to comunicate with mortall Princes, who are obserued to to preponder with themselues, first how to shape their behauiour, and externall gesture: Secondly, how to
                     •
                   frame their speech to gaine Attention of him, to whom they speake: and how to auoide the censure of indiscretion, in the deliuery of what they affirme, or defend. If such curiositie and carefulnesse be necessarily obserued, in our communication with men, whose breath is in their nosthrels: how much more obseruant and carefull ought we to bee, when wee addresse our selues to speake vnto the Maiestie of the immortal God? To intrude abruptly into the presence of this great God, & vnaduisedly to speake vnto him, becommeth not a petitioner, but bewrayeth an vnsanctified, and an vnprepared heart; rather tempting and dishonouring,

then glorifying of the name of God. And therefore, before we presume to present our petitions to God, in hope to be heard; we must prepare ourselues, not in our outwardgesture, onely in eloquence of words, and Pharisaicall outward holines: But in rightly ordering, and disposing the affections of the inner man; which, if they be set on carnall, or earthly vanities, if our hearts delight in the fruits of the flesh, and the vnprofitable works of darknesse: (though our words be neuer so good of themselues) we may feare the reward of Ananias and Saphira his wife, who brought a part of their substance (hypocritically conceiling the rest) and layd that part at the Apostles feet. So, if we come vnto God, giuing him good words, keeping backe our hearts, to serue our owne carnall and prophane appetites: Shall we thinke that God will be content with the

leaues of our good words, when we giue the fruits of our hearts to the world? will God take such hypocrites by the hand? we must know, that vnlesse we can truely and vnfeinedly cast off our carnall thoughts, corrupt desires, and sinnefull affections, it cannot be that God, who loueth holinesse and truth, in the inward affections, can looke vpon vs, as vpon his children, who speake vnto him, as to a father, with counterfeit words, proceeding from vnsanctified hearts. When wee come therefore vnto God in prayer, we must depart from all iniquitie, knowing that he heareth not sinners, such as the promises of God cannot win to obedience; nor his threates inforce to forsake their sinnes; who yet will aduenture to rush rashly into the presence of God, in a formall kind of praying with the lips, without any premeditation preparation,

or reformation of the heart, at all. These offer wordes for deedes: Leaues for Fruit: Wolues for Lambes; and all maner, halt, lame, blinde, and blemished sacrifices, and yet would seeme holy: And so, instead of a blessing, procure a curse vnto themselues for their hypocrisie. Wee must consider that God is a iealous God, & holdeth none guiltlesse, that taketh his name in vaine, as they manifestly doe, that come neere him with their lips, when their hearts are farre from him. It is a kind of spirituall adultery, outwardly to seeme wholy to be gods, and yet inwardly to be meere worldlings. Before we open our mouthes therefore, to God, we must cast out of the Temple of God, (which is our heart) all buyers and sellers, as Christ did out of the Temple of Ierusalem: for as long as our hearts doe harbour the desires of worldly profits, and carnall

pleasures, aboue the sincere seruice of God, our heart, the Temple of the liuing God, becommeth a den of theeues, that steales away all our godly affections, to settle them on Belial. Let vs looke vnto the man Christ Iesus crucified, by whose blood wee are redeemed, by whose mediation wee are sure to haue our prayers heard of God, and granted; especially, if for our further and more perfect preparation, we can truely obserue the rule of Christ, to forgiue our enemies, knowing that if we forgiue not our brother that offendeth vs, God will not forgiue vs, that farre more grieuously offend him. And therefore, Christ counselleth vs, that if we bring our sacrifice to the Altar, namely, if we intend to pray; and there remember that a brother hath ought against vs, we ought to leaue our offering before the
                  
                  Altar, that is, forbear for the time to pray, yet to continue our holy intention to pray; and to goe first, and bee reconciled to our brother, and then to come to offer our gift; namely, our prayers, freely vnto God in Christ: for before we be vnburthened of all rancor, malice, enuie hatred, and all other prophane desires; it is not only not auaileable, but lamentable, that so many will (as doe) presume to come before God, with hearts so fearefully fraught with these vnholy affections; and stagger no more to presse into Gods presence, nay, not so much, as some that come vnto God, with most prepared, peacefull, and most sanctified consciences. Let such castout the bond woman with her sonne; namely, the old man, the works and lusts of the flesh: and giue entertainment vnto the freewoman, and her sonne, the new
                  
                  man, which, after God is created vnto righteousnes, and true holines: And so recommend our prayers vnto God, the obiect of our prayers, in Christ the Mediator of our prayers, by the holy Ghost, the Author of all holy prayers.
            
            
               Attention in Prayer.
               Being thus prepared, let vs endeuour to yeeld due and true attention in our prayers, that is, to giue 
                     •
                  eed to what we pray, to whom we pray, for what we pray, and with what zeale we pray: which are the truest tokens, and greatest arguments, that our prayers are liuely, powerfull, effectuall, and of faith; which properties can neuer be in lip-labour: for there cannot be a more apparent discouery of a rancke Hypocrite, then to make outward showes of Deuotion, with the gesture and lippes, and yet the heart to be busied, in the cogitation

of idle, 
                     •
                  arthly, and prophane things. And nothing more discouereth an idle heart outwardly, then the wandering of the eye in the time of diuine prayer: for it is probable, and often found by experience, that the eye withdraweth the heart: and if the eye be inconstant, the prayer hath not, nor can haue the due attention of the heart: yet it doth not follow, that although the eye bee fixed on any certaine obiect, or be shut, that therefore the heart is rightly set on God, for oftentimes the eye followes the heart, the cogitation of the heart making the eye to forget it obiect: as when the heart is wandring in the fields of corne, viewing the herdes of cattle, and flockes of sheepe, when it is in the ware-house, in the shoppe, in the chest, minding bands & payments, ouercome with pride, plotting reuenge, oppressed with feare, besotted

with pleasure, i
                     •
                  tangled with cares, or otherwise peruerted by any prophane and vngodly cogitations. Prayers made witls such an extra
                     •
                  agant heart, be they in words neuer so holy, they are imputed vnto vs as sin: for shall wee thinke, that God will heare our prayers, to our profit or comfort, when the thoughts of our hearts, in the meane time, dishonor him? Many pray in their owne familiar language, and yet consider no more what they speake (for want of attention) then if they spake in an vnknowne tongue: and yet such men will hold themselues very deuout, and to haue power in themselues to pray when they list: as if true prayer wer
                     •
                   of that facilitie and ease, to vtter, as is an idle tale, and as it seemes by beggers, that tumble out the Lords prayer, with one breath at a doore, and yet minde nothing but their almes.

Such men are to be pitied, and to be wished better to aduise themselues, before they attempt this seruice of God most holy; for Prayer is not an easie worke, it is of a deeper straine then a tale, that is but from the tongue to the teeth, from the teeth to the lips, and so into the ayre. True prayer is cordiall, and of that force and efficacie, as it constraineth the heart to sighes, groanes and teares, with such inward 
                        •

                        •
                     ting of the hart. And the more we feele our hearts thus inwardly sharply touched: so much the more comfort it yeeldeth to the soule of the faithfull petitioner, yea such, and so great consolation, as he that feeles it, cannot expresse it with his tongue, be he neuer so eloquent; neither can any conceiue or apprehend the sweetnes

of it, that is not exercised and experienced in the same; for nature apprehendeth it not. No man can say that Iesus is Christ, but by the holy Ghost: and, none can desire the Spirit of God, but by the Spirit of God. Flesh and bloud cannot as much as desire spirituall things, spiritually; for spirituall things are to be compared with spirituall things, and spirituall gifts are obtained by spirituall meanes: And therefore are words without the spirit, as naked and bare incense without fire: but, being inkindled in the heart, and sanctified by the holy spirit of God, who is promised to assist our spirits, they are as a liuely and acceptable sacrifice to God, working so powerfully with him, through Christs medi

                  tion, as they neuer returne empty of what soeuer blessing we desire. Prayer can neuer be effectuall,

                  me

certaine spirituall obiect of the mind, to moue the attention of the heart, which obiect is God: and we must consider, that when we pray vnto him, or yeeld him any other worship, that we are not to conceiue him, in the forme of any earthly or heauenly, bodily, or spirituall creature whatsoeuer: for in that maner, not to conceiue him, is a degree of cōceiuing him a right, according to Master Perkins. God must be conceiued of vs in our prayers, as subsisting in the whole three persons, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. The vnitie in Trinitie, and T
                        •
                     initie in vnitie is to be worshipped, retaining in mind, the distinction, and order of all the three persons, without seuering or sundring them: for, as they are conioyned in nature; so are they to be conioyned in worship. And therefore, he that prayeth vnto God the Father, for

the forgiuenesse of his sinnes, must aske it of him, for the merits of the Sonne, and by the assurance of the holy Ghost: and he that prayeth for the remission of sinnes to God the Sonne, must pray that he would procure the Father, to graunt him pardon, and to assure it by his Spirit. He also that prayeth for the same to God the holy Ghost, must pray that he would assure vnto him the remission of his sinnes, from the Father, for and by the merits of his Sonne. Thus must we apprehend the Trinitie in our prayers: so shall we auoide that idolatrous conceiuing of him, imbraced of some, who cannot pray, vnlesse they haue the figure of a humane creature, to represent vnto their bodily eyes, the shape of God the Father, in likenesse of an olde man, and a crucifixe, figuring Christ, suffring on the Crosse, and the holy Ghost, by a Doue,

whose worship cannot bee reputed spirituall, but carnall, and their prayers, not heauenly, but prophane. Prayer is a spirituall action, proper onely to the children of God, who are Saints by calling, sanctified in Christ: And they, and none other truely call vpon the name of the Lord Iesus: prophane persons pray not, though they seeme to pray. But most happie is that man, that commeth vnto God, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, truely prepared, and duely attentiue; he may boldly aske, and confidently assure himselfe, to receiue grace for grace, and all blessings spirituall, without limitation, and all benefits corporall needfull. If▪ our prayers bee made in vs, by him, who hath promised, and hath power to giue what we aske, shall wee thinke hee will faile to performe? The hope of hypocrites in deed shall perish, and their

                  prayers vanish as the smoake: because they wait vpon lying vanities, and desire carnall pleasures, and worldly profits. But the Lord will surely fulfill the desires of them that feare him, because their prayers tend to the setting foorth of Gods glory, to the good of the Church, to the remission of their owne sinnes, and other mens, to the obtaining of Gods graces, to the increase of the vnderstanding of heauenly things, that they may walke before God, and be vpright, that they may doe the workes, and bring sorth the fruits of the spirit. These are the prayers that are the PENSIVE SOVLES DELIGHT. These are the prayers that wound the Serpent, & that please God, bringing peace to the conscience afflicted. But, (which is to bee lamented) all men are dull by nature: And the very elect, sometimes

weakely disposed to pray. And therefore is euery godly man to vse all holy meanes, to inkindle their hearts, to the right performance of this heauenly dutie: And nothing more preuaileth therein, then Meditation: whereunto wee are also very vnapt by nature, and know not how, nor vpon what ground to lay the foundation therof: yet, if we can truly frame our hearts to a holy Meditation, wee shal find, that it is the very key, that openeth our dull hearts, lockt vp vnder griefe, vnder feare, vnder trouble, vnder persecutiō
                   & misery; and sendeth forth by litle and litle, the fire of true zeale, which at length becommeth a great flame of preuailing prayers, which thing they easily find, that are conuersant in this sacred exercise of Meditation and Prayer: who yet, many times finde themselues most dull, and most vnapt to pray, hauing yet

an inward desire thereunto, which desire they cannot containe: but labouring a while in silence, speaking inwardly to God, in sighes and groanes, at length they speake effectually with their tongues. Seeing therefore that all men need motiues to stirre them vp to prayer: let euery man addresse himselfe to the word of God, or peruse some godly worke of religious men. And although vocally he cannot reade, by reason of his naturall dulnes; yet, if his heart can be but conuersant, and duely attend the sence, as the eye obserues the letter, his minde by little and little shall mount it selfe from earth to heauen, fixed on the Trinitie, whence shall arise such spirituall fruits of faith, and feruencie of spirit, as shall fill the soule with more sweet consolation byinkindled praier, then the tongue can vtter. And to this end (gentle

Reader) according to the small measure of mine vnderstanding, I haue prefixed before euery prayer, a Motiue or Meditation, touching the substance and matter of the Prayer following.
            
            
               Thankesgiuing after Prayer.
               The third and last duty in this holy exercise is Thankesgiuing, which cannot but follow sanctified praiers, & that with such ioy in the holy Ghost, as it cannot but break forth into most vnspeakeable inward thākfulnes to God, who hath beene so graciously pleased, not only to forgiue our sins, but to helpe our infirmities by his holy spirit, by whom wee haue had accesse vnto the throne of grace, & found such fauour with God in Christ, as we haue obtained by the holy Ghost, both the will and the power to pray. Also we ought in all things to giue thankes to God, for euery blessing and benefit wee receiue

at his hands, according to the counsell and precept of the Apostle, who commands vs to giue thankes alwayes for all things vnto God, euen the Father, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, Ephes. 5. 20. Thus much touching the admonition.
            
            
               Great Britaines happines, in regard of the free vse of the Gospell, in respect of other Nations.
               FInally, I thinke it not impertinent altogether, by way of comparison, to consider of our happines, in being partakers of the free vse of the Gospell, in respect of the most vnhappie condition of many Nations, and infinite people, that either know not God at all, or knowing him, honour him not as God.
               The Old and New Testaments
                  
haue beene freely opened vnto vs, neere threescore yeares without Persecution: and so it hath not been in any one Kingdom we reade of. Some Kingdomes and Free States, in their Iurisdictions, haue and doe in a sort, permit the Gospell; but with the same, tolerate contrary religions & professions. Where doth the freedome of the Gospell appeare, as in Great Britaine? In what Kingdome is it so publikely receiued, so plentifully preached, and so freely professed, without danger or contradiction? We haue heard, and seene the troubles of the Netherlands, and the Massacres of France, and the persecutiōs in other territories for the profession of the Gospell: and we all this while haue quietly enioyed that, for the profession wherof many haue perished. May wee not therefore truely say with Dauid,
                  
                  The Lord hath not dealt so with euery Nation? Queene ELIZABETH restored Religion, almost smothered by Queen MARIES persecution, which was maruailous in euery mans eyes. But which is more maruailous, the same Religion is continued by the meere loue and prouidence of God, in raising vnto vs a Prince of most admired learning, of sincerest pietie: And that when it was vniuersally either expected, or suspected to haue bin vtterly abolished and rooted out, vpon the dissolution of the precedent Gouernesse: we hauing then the free vse of the meanes of our Saluation vnder God, by our worthiest of Kings, wee should shew our selues most vnworthie both of it and him, if we should not most louingly embrace him, vnfainedly honor him, cheerefully obey him,

willingly aide him, and zealously pray for him. Many other Princes tyrannously suppresse, what hee religiously maintaineth, the sincere seruice of God. In so much as in regard of the time that wee haue had true Religion in free vse, wee might haue beene all teachers of the Truth, yea, the meanest amongst vs, of competent age, might haue beene as Doctors, and all our Diuine Doctors, as the Angels of God. But (which is lamentable to be considered) the most of vs are not only not able to instruct them of our owne housholds, but haue nee de that the principles of Christian Religion should be taught vs anew. How shall we then answere the Master of this great Family, that hath giuen vs many talents to vse to our

soules profit; who, when he shall come to take our account, and finde that we haue not only not profited by them, but to haue wasted them vpon our vanities: will hee allow our counterfeite hearing of his Word, our idle prayers, our workes of darknesse? Hee hath giuen vs the light of truth, and hidden it from many millions of soules (altogether) in Asia, Africa, and America, and dazeled the eyes of many in Europe, that onely see a glimmering of that light, which lighteneth the world, and yet many in their pretended light comprehended it not. To passe ouer such as are 
                     •
                  emisted in Europe: let vs looke into some of the territories of the East and West Indies: Into Brasill, Callicut, Virginia,
                  
and many other Nations in those parts, who know no other GOD, but the Diuell, to whom they pray, whom they worshippe, and to whom they doe sacrifice; offering their dearest children vnto him. The Guyneans adore for their god, the Creature which they first meet
                     •
                   in the morning, Beast, Bird, or Serpent. The Angolans honour the Sunne, as the greatest god, and the Moone as the lesse: Besides which, euery man hath his peculiar god, according to his owne priuate fansie. In the Kingdome of Loaugo in Africa, are a people called Anziques, hauing in vse the S
                     •
                  ale of the first Couenant, Circumcision: yet hath God left them to that, more then bestiall condition, as they will

cut their owne flesh, and butcher themselues, for their deceiuing Mahomets sake yet doe they eate one the other, fatting their slaues like hogs, hauing a Shamble Market, and Cookeries of mans flesh: and the neerest of kin, is killed and eaten for the greatest and rarest daintie. Many other like Canibals are in those partes, visibly seene to eate men really: But in some other more neere territories, they deuoure men aliue: Couert Canibals. It were much to remember all the nations (infinite) vnder the apparant captiuitie of Sathan, who, how hee bewitched the olde world with false gods, the Canonicall Scriptures doe declare. The Sidonians adored Balaam and Ashteroth: The Ammonites, Moloch: The

                  Moabites, Chamos: The Babylonians, Bel, the father of Ninus: To whose counterfeit, that great king Cyrus did worship, and allowed a dayly dyet, of twelue measures of fine flowre, containing of our statute measure, thirteene bushels and a halfe, fortie sheepe, and sixe great potts of wine; of our measure, threescore gallons. This was a gluttonous god, a beso
                        •
                     ted king, a bewitched people, and most accursed priestes, that coozoned their god of his victuals, whom, by this meanes, the deuill robbed of their Saluation. Besides these, whom God hath shut vp vnder darknesse, the dispersed runnagate Iewes, are most of all the rest to bee condemned, who wilfully abandoned their Messias, whom

they knew and crucified; And according to their owne imprecation, are helde still in most palpable blindnesse, and in 
                     ••
                  auerie, both in bodies and soules: hauing neither Scepter, gouernour, nor gouernement, nor any certaine place of commorance. Insomuch, as if all the people, nations, and tongues in Asia, Africa, America, and Europe, were truely calculated, and their Religions discouered, as Master PVRCHACE hath most worthily begunne: there would not bee found vpon the earths vniuersall Globe, one of two hundred parts, truely professing Christ; without whome there is no promise of Saluation: which discouereth the most miserable condition of infinite millions of people vnder

the slauery of Sathan, and our most happy, and most blessed estate vnder Christ, whose Gospell we enioy, whose promises we haue, whose merits are ours, whose mercies we find, the aide and helpe of whose spirit wee feele. Greater blessings God could neuer haue bestowed on man: for these in earth are but pledges of our saluation in Heauen: which being well weighed and compared to the former forlorne Nations, cannot (in reason) but mooue vs to loue, and to serue this so mercifull a GOD with such sincere and intire affection, as should swallow vp in vs all worldly and carnall desires, and (as it were) rauish vs with most spirituall contemplations. But, if wee

that haue receiued so manie and sure tokens of our blessednesse in Christ; and hauing promised and vowed obedience to GOD in him▪ If we (I say) that haue the name of Christians, should liue like these Pagans: It had beene better for vs, neuer to haue knowne the truth: for it shall bee easier in th

                  daie of iudgement, for Pagans that neuer knew GOD, then for vs that know his will, and doe it not. And it is probable, that if the blindest of these blinde Nations, 
                  
                     •
                  ad had the time of the learning of Christ crucified, as wee haue had, they had beene Christians, and exceeded our present sinceritie, sanctitie, zeale, obedience, and true seruice of the liuing
                  
                  God, in CHRIST, by the Holy Ghost. Let vs therefore well weigh our happinesse, in respect of theirs, that are in a most cursed condition, and let vs consider, that there is with GOD Mercie and Iustice, hee can call them in his free mercie, as he called vs, and reiect vs in his Iustice, for our contempt of his Word. And therefore as wee haue the light, let vs walke in the light, as children of the light. Let euery one, as hee professeth, practise the truth, and depart euery one from his euill way, and cheerefully call vpon the Lord Iesus: Let vs abandon all our carnall affections: our moderate libertie, our too much securitie, and our coldnesse in our Religion: knowing

that most vnsauourie seruitude followes these at the heeles. For GOD hath his Pharaoh, his Nabucadnezer, and manie other like Ty

                     ts, alwayes readily prepared, besides infinite other plagues, to afflict and confound a rebellious and thanklesse people. Hee hath often and fearefully threatned vs, and yet he hath still put vp his rodde againe in mercie. But did hee not see manie thinges amisse in vs, he would forbeare to threaten as he hath done. And who so seeth not manie things out of course, in the carriage of men in their vngodly actions, wilfully shuts the eyes of reason, and seeth nothing a
                     •
                   all with the eyes of Religion.
               
               Let vs therefore be continually

watchfull in prayer, that, when the Lord commeth to Iudgement, we may be so prepared with our Lamps in our hands, to attend his comming, as becommeth the children of God.

                  IN our preparation to prayer, we must first consider, that hee to whome wee speake, is the Father of light, and we are by nature the children of darknesse: we must therefore call vpon him in the sinceritie, and vprightnes of our harts; for he loues truth in the inward affections. Secondly, he is the Father of glory, we must therefore come before him, with feare and reuerence, for we are

                  but dust and ashes. Thirdly, he is the Father of mercie; therefore we must repent of our sins: and then being thus prepared, let vs draw neere vnto him with a pure heart, in assurance and faith. So will he heare vs, and grant better things vnto vs, then we know how to aske.
               
                  A prayer for the assistance of Gods holy Spirit, in any spirituall or godly corporall action, or endeuour; fit to be vsed before euery lawfull enterprise, especially before euery diuine exercise.
                  O Gracious Lord God, most merciful, louing, and helping Father; the supporter of the weake, the light of the blinde, the teacher of the ignorant, the directer of all that call vpon thee in their godly endeuors: I humbly beseech thy Maiestie, in the name of thy Sonne Christ Iesus, to heare me, in whom thou hast promised, to giue vnto thy children, what they aske, to finde what they seeke; and to open vnto them when they knocke. I come vnto thee, good Father, not in mine owne, but in his name, intreating

thee not for mine owne, but for his sake, to accept me into thy presence, to giue me thy holy Spirit of wisedome, that I may receiue mercie, and finde grace. Open vnto mee the gate of true knowledge; and assist me in mine intended enterprise: for, of my selfe, I am of a dull and weake vnderstanding, of a corrupt conuersation, of a polluted heart, and of prophane lips; vnworthy of my selfe to attempt any worldly or corporall enterprise, much lesse worthy to take thy blessed name into my mouth, or to intermeddle with any diuine office, function or calling. But touch my hart, Lord, and inkindle it with a coale from thine Altar, so shal my heart be renued, reformed and enlarged, the words of my mouth sanctified, and the workes of my hands blessed. According therefore vnto thy promise, Lord, open my mouth and fill it: strengthen my hands, and confirme the powers and senses both of my soule and bodie, to euery good and godly action. It is not in my power, without thy power, to open my naturall lippes,
                     
much lesse able, ye
                        •
                     , altogether vnable to open the dore of my heart, and to prepare mine owne affections, to any diuine and holy action, or to frame the powers of my body rightly in any comfortable enterprise, without thy meere working in me both the will and the deed. Only my confidence is, Lord, that thou wilt be pleased to assist me, to inlighten my heart, to increase my knowledge, and to giue me vnderstanding according to thy word: That by thee I may be enabled in all mine actions, enterprises, and in
                        •
                     euours, to set forth thine owne glory. Sanctif

                     e my inward desires, blesse the will and the worke in me, and accept my weake will for the effectuall deed; And so season me in both, that I may be sanctified throughout. And grant that the fruits of all mine endeuours, may so effectually appeare, that my selfe in them, and by them may be comforted; and thy children, to whose vse also, as to mine owne, I truly intend them, may bee benefited, and stirred vp to a more liuely feeling of their owne wants, and a

more serious desire to pray to thee for thy blessings, and to praise thee for thy relieuing fauours: That we thy weake children, feeling the Comforter to assist our weaknesse, we may in our seueral callings, offer vp such daily sacrifices vnto thee, as being, for Christ, accepted of thee, thou maye
                        ••
                      be more and more glorified, and euery one of vs comforted and kept in thy fauour for euer, through Jesus Christ our Sauiour.
                  O Lord increase my faith.
               
            
            
               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer to be vsed in the Morning in priuate Families.
               
               
                  IT is a common course, and an ordinarie care of worldly mē, before they enterprise any thing, that concerns their corporal estats, to fore-cast how, and by what meanes they may doe it to their best aduantage,

and most safetie: which prouidence is not onely not to be condemned, but commended, yet so farre, as it may iustly reproue themselues, for being so carefull for their bodies necessaries; and so remisse and carelesse of their soules safety: which being truly prouided for, first there followes a blessing to the second, by diuine promise. Seeke first the kingdome of God (saith Christ) and the righteousnes thereof, and then all other things necessary shall be administred vnto you. How grossely then doe they erre from a Christian course of life, that are neuer but conuersant and carefull about corporall things, that rise vp earely to seek their profits and pleasures, and seeke not God the giuer of goodnesse, without whose mercy and prouidence, we neither can enioy our sleepe, nor safetie in sleepe? we cannot worke in our callings, nor profit by our labours, health of bodie, wealth, peace, plentie, friends, and all whatsoeuer wee enioy in this life, or hope for in the life to come, do all proceed of his free mercie, who requireth nothing for recompence, but our thankefulnesse for them, and our prayers vnto him, for the continuance

of his fauours towards vs, in them. All which will rise in iudgement against them that vsurpe thē without acknowledging them to be his gifts, and that in Christ, blessed vnto them. What differs the carnall man, that riseth in the morning, leauing behind him the print (as it were) of his pollutions in the bed whence he riseth; and neither praiseth God for his sleepe nor safety, neither craueth pardon for his sinnes? But from his bed betakes him either to his worldly profit, or carnall pleasures. What differs he (I say) from the brute beast, who riseth in the morning from his den or rest, and betakes him to his'prey or pasture, looking vnto no other giuer, then his own brutish care? No more do they that eat, and drink, and labour, or delite them in their vaine pleasures; without seeking first in the morning a new blessing for the day following, by their hartie thanksgiuing, for their rest and preseruation the night past, and by crauing pardon for their sinnes. Howsoeuer things may seeme to succeed to their great contentment, they doe but deceiue themselues, for there is no blessing promised to such carelesse mē, though

they haue the names, and receiue the seales of Christians. And therefore let euery man that feareth God, and desireth to see a good day to follow the morning: let him begin the day with the seruice of God in prayer: if hee haue a family, let him conuent them, and conioyne with them in prayer. If he haue none, or be absent from it, let him serue the Lord in priuate. The faithful herein findeth such liuely comfort, and assurance of Gods prouidence, as he feareth not whatsoeuer the day following can cast vpon him, all things shall worke together for his consolation: And whatsoeuer hee doth, it shall prosper.
               
                  A Prayer for the Morning for priuate families.
                  Lord increase our faith, prepare our hearts to prayer, and open our lippes.
                  O Mercifull Lord God, louing father in Iesus Christ, wee thine vnworthy people fall heere downe before the footstoole of thy Maiestie, and with vnfayned hearts giue thankes vnto thee

for thy mercies, in number more then can be numbred: for they are more then our sinnes, and our sins more then the sea sands, which are without number. Thou hast bene our watchman this night: thou hast not onely kept vs from bodily daungers and harmes, but hast giuen vs rest, when our weake bodies were infeebled with wearinesse and labours, and hast brought vs to the beginning of this day in safety: whereas many haue perished this night in their beds, and haue not risen to prayse thee. How vnthankefull should wee shew our selues, Lord, if we should enter into our worldly affaires, without remembring thy mercies, and our owne sinnes in asking pardon for them? Receiue therefore, wee humbly pray thee, good father, at our vnworthy hands, the sacrifice of our humble prayers, and prayses which we offer vnto thee this morning, in the name of thine owne dearest Sonne: in whom thou hast acknowledged thy selfe so well pleased, as thou deniest nothing to any faithfully asking for his sake.

Jn him, and by him, and for him, we come (Lord) vnto thee, humbly and heartily praying pardon for our sinnes, wherby we haue transgressed thy lawes, offended thy great Maiestie, in whose displeasure is death. Pardon vs, mercifull Lord God, pardon vs, remoue our sinnes farre from vs, and wi
                        •
                     e them out of the booke of thy remembrance. Remember the merits of Christ our Redeemer, leaue vs not in our owne miserable estates, lest we should forget to be mindfull or to be ignorant how to prayse thy Name, for thy goodnes past, and enter into our worldly occasions, without being reconciled vnto thee in Christ, for thy wrath being inkindled towards vs neuer so little, nothing can truely prosper that we take in hand: we may labour, and yet without thy blessing, it shall not profite vs: 
                        〈◊〉
                      may eat and drinke, but it shall not nourish vs, we may follow our vocations, with great diligence, rysing earely▪ and taking rest late, yet shall it not feede vs. Oh gracious Lord, let thy blessings accompany

all our labours; And grace vs euer with thy presence, according to thy promise, not to obserue our imperfections: but to direct our heartes in prayer, to prepare vs to obedience, to season vs with thy holy spirit, and to blesse and prosper all our actions: That whatsoeuer wee thinke, speake or doe this day, may be acceptable in thy fight. So shall all things goe well with vs, and prosper vnder our hands, we shall prayse thy name, and extoll thy mercies and goodnesse, which haue bene, are, and shall be towards vs for euer. And as thou hast taken away the vale of the darkenesse of night, which resembleth death: And hast opened vnto vs the windowes of heauen, to giue vs the light of the Sunne, which resembleth life: So abandon thou the workes of darkenesse and ignorance, put away our faintnesse and dulnesse in prayer: And let the light of thy sauing truth; shine vnto vs, and the Sunne of righteousnesse extend his beames of heauenly vnderstanding into our heartes, That we all may walk this day, in

the way which is Christ the Lord, imbrace the truth, which is the Lambe of God that taketh away the sinnes of the world, And euer inioy that life which is eternall in him, which was, and which is, and which is to come. So shall our rysing from our naturall rest this morning, by thy power, as out of our graues of mortalitie, assure vs of our finall rysing out of the graue of our sins to immortality. And as thou hast blessed vnto vs our temporal sleepe this night: So vouchsafe to blesse vnto vs this day, the vse of thy creatures, that they may all serue to our comfortable vse in Christ Iesus, according to our necessities. And graunt that wee abuse them not to ryot or wantonnesse: but may carefully and religiously watch and be sober, that when our finall sleepe shall ouertake vs, we may lay downe our mortall bodies, not vnto the resurrection of death vnto death, but of the resurrection of life vnto life eternall. And during the time of our mortalitie; remember vs, O Lord, in the abundance of thy mercies, lest that wee

who are but dust and ashes, should so fasten the eyes of our desires, vpon the base things of this life, that we should forget the life to come: Graunt rather, Lord, that we may vse the things of this life at thy hands, so as we may not be seduced by them, but rather led by the consideration, whence and from whom we receiue them, vnto the authour and giuer of them: So shal they not onely, not be vnto vs vaine or base; but worthy to be had in reuerence, for thy sake that giuest them freely, and blessest them graciously vnto our vse & comfort: which great mercy of thine, cannot but aduance the eies of our dul vnderstandings, to the contemplation of thy spirituall and heauenly blessings. As how we were freely from all beginnings elected to saluation by thee: how we were created when wee were not, by thee: how we were redeemed, when wee were captiues vnto Sathan, by thee: How wee were sauctified, when we were most prophane, by thee: How we are iustified, being guiltie of iudgement, by thee: How

we haue taken hold of the hope, future glorification of our corrupt & vile bodies, in the life to come by thee. These thy super-abounding mercies, O Lord, who hath a heart to conceiue, or a tongue sufficiently to expresse? The Angels that attend thee in the heauens, beholding thee face to face, and minister thy will, in heauen and earth, are not yet able to declare the good things themselues inioy, by the glory of thy presence. Much lesse are we, Lord, who lodge in houses of clay, able to comprehend thee, and the height and depth of thine incomprehensible goodnes, shewed to them in earth, whom thou hast made heires with thy Sonne, of the glory in heauen. How much lesse able are wee to conceiue the glory prepared, for thine elect in the heauens? Giue vs therefore, good father, hearts of loue vnto thy Maiestie; that we may striue, with a godly egernesse, rather to abandon all lets & impediments, which may hinder vs from that promised glory, then curiously to seeke to kn
                        •
                     w, in this mortalitie that (the

secrets whereof) thou hast reserued vntil our immortalitie. And let not the cares of this transitory life, and the blind affections which we naturally beare vnto the pleasures thereof, choake the good seede of grace in vs. Make the way of our saluation familiar vnto vs, as thou hast made it plaine for vs. And let not our bodily labours hinder our hearts from continuall meditation of thy goodnesse towards vs. Let vs lift vp pure mindes vnto the heauens, with a longing desire to with thee: where is no labour or sweate, or feare, or care, or hunger, or thirst, or nakednesse, or enemies, or strife, or paine, or griefe: But all comfort, all ioy, all peace and blessednes, and glory vnspeakable: Giue vs therefore longing hearts, to remoue out of this body of miseries: yet so, as we omit not our callings, vntill thine appointed time: but that we may labour accordingly in the world, not, as we so loued the world, as we should imbrace it as our home: but vse it as our Tabernacle, or lodging place, for the time of our pilgrimage.

And let thy blessing bee so vpon our labours this day, as wee may liue thereby, haue sufficient of all necessaries; as food, rayment, friendship, peace, plentie, health of bodie, preseruation of our limbes and sences, and a blessing vpon all that belongeth vnto vs. That we be not constrained to vse vnlawfull meanes for our reliefe. Then as we by thy blessing, haue entred into this morning, shall passe the day with comfort, and end the same in peace of conscience and consolation of the holy Ghost: and so continue from day to day, vntill the last of our dayes, when we shall surrender againe vnto thee, to be disposed both our soules and bodies, for euer to liue with thee in the glory purchased by Christ our mediator, our hope, our strength, and our euerlasting redeemer, to whom with thee and the holy Ghost, bee all power, maiestie and dominion ascribed for euer,
                  Amen.
                  O Lord euermore increase and confirme our faith.
               
               
                  
                  A short prayer for the morning, to be said of one in priuate, or in a Family, vsing the plurall instead of the singular number.
                  ALmightie Lord God, whose presence is alwaies light vnto thy Saints, vouchsafe as thou hast banished the darknesse of the night past, and made the light to shine vnto our corporal eyes: So let the sauing Sunne of thy holy Spirit, lighten the darkenesse of mine vnderstanding this morning. And as the Sun of the firmament cleareth, cheereth, and comforteth all thy creatures in earth, with the beames thereof: so let thy sacred and sauing countenance recomfort my sad and dulled heart: and as it hath pleased thee to giue me power and ablenesse, to rise out of my bed of corporall rest; and by the sleepe which I haue this night enioyed, haue in some measure shaken off the heauie sluggishnes of my fleshly part: So I beseech thee to giue me power to rise out of the bed of sinne and securitie, and with cheerefull alacritie, to cast off the dulnes and drowsines of my corrupt heart, that

with full affection and entire loue, I may praise thee for thy loue, wherein thou hast preserued mee this night from perils and dangers of the darknes, wherein the secret arrowes of Satan and sin, are sent forth to wound, euen the vpright in heart; wherein diuers casualties befall them that are dead in their sleepe, not able to preuent the least danger incident to soule or bodie: and hast now graciously brought me to the beginning of this day in safety, the end whereof, nor the least remaining part, what it shall afford me, thou only knowest, from whose all-seeing eye
                        •
                      nothing is hid, but as well the times to come, as the seasons past and present, are alike manifest. As thou therefore knowest what shal succeed me this day, turne those things from me, Lord, in thy prouidence, which thou knowest dangerous, and blesse vnto me all things for my comfort, and whatsoeuer befalleth me contrary to my health, wealth, or peace, make me wise to make vse thereof to the confirmation of my further faith in thee: knowing,

Lord, that all things shall worke together for the best to them that loue thee. And therefore giue me patience to vndergoe al thy corrections and trials, and to be vnfainedly thankfull for all thy benefits. And for asmuch as nothing can prosper vnto vs without thy blessing: blesse Lord, I beseech thee, vnto me all such thy creatures, as I shall haue cause to vse this day, & giue a blessing vnto all that appertaineth vnto me, whomsoeuer, or whatsoeuer, and let the meditations of my hart, the words of my mouth, and the labours both of my bodie and minde, be sanctified vnto me this day; that whatsoeuer. I doe, it may prosper. I recommend my selfe, my soule and bodie, & all that I haue charge of vnder thee, into thy fatherly tuition and defence this day: for I know, Lord, and am assured, that thou, to whom I commit me, ar
                        •
                      able and willing to keepe me. Let not my sinnes, gracious Father, which I haue no power to resist, preuent thy mercies, but in thy mercie preuent my sinnes; for Satan, the World, and mine owne corruptions,
                     
are euer ready to draw me into forbiddē vanities. But strengthen thou the armes of my faith, teach my spirituall fingers to fight valiantly against their enemies: giue me the sword of the Spirit, the brest-plate of righteousnes, the helmet of saluation, that I feare not their assaults this day, that fighting the good fight of faith, I may preuaile, and receiue the crowne of victorie, through Christ, that triumphant Lion of the Tribe of Iudah. Remember thy promises made vnto all that beleeue in him. I beleeue Lord, helpe mine vnbeliefe. Let the fruits of that loue, that is greater then faith, and hope, appeare in mine actions this day; the chiefe wherof is obedience vnto thee. So shall I passe this day in thy faith, feare, & due reuerence of thy great and glorious name: and daily more and more prepare my selfe in a holy readines to attend thy calling mee out of this mortall, to an immortall condition. And for my greater comfort in this my pilgrimage, giue me a true feeling of the ioyes promised in the Kingdome of glorie,

euen here in the Kingdom of grace, that hauing heere receiued the earnest of thy holy Spirit, I may daily looke for the principall, in the Kingdom purchased by Iesus Christ, in whose name I humbly recommend my selfe and all my labours this day, vnto thy blessed prouidence and direction, yeelding vnto thee all praise in Iesus Christ, by the holy Ghost, blessed for euer and euer.
                  Lord increase my faith.
               
            
            
               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer, to be said in the Euening in priuate Families.
               
               
                  IT is a matter too common with many, to passe the day in a kind of lawlesse vanitie, and the night in carelesse securitie: as if the day and night were only made for man to serue himselfe, with the pleasures and profits he can make

of either; forgetting the true end, for which either themselues, or the day and night were made, that themselues were made to glorifie their Maker, in reason and religion. The day to serue them, for holy exercises and lawfull labours: And the night for their corporall rest. But contrarily, themselues, they prophane through many sinnes. The day they abuse by idlenesse, wantonnesse, and vanities: And the night they pollute with many forbidden euils: And yet passe from day to night, and from euening to the day light; neuer calling to minde that holy duetie required of them, thanksgiuing to God for blessings receiued, their humble prayers for pardon of their sins committed, and their continuall supplications, for their safetie and prosperous successe in their labours and affaires. Doth the profession of a Christian require no more then to eate and drink, to labour, or loyter, to passe the time in gaming, pleasure, idlenes, ease and sl
                     ••
                  pe? Are not these the workes that worldlings wallow in? Some are too great and glorious to labour, and yet haue no leasure to pray. Some are so busied in worldly affaire
                     •
                  , as they can

admit no time to serue God, but the Sabbath day, and then to come to the Church to see and be seene, is the deuotion of many. Is this to loue God aboue all things, as all haue vowed? to serue him before all things, and to depend vpon him in all things? It rather argueth that the Loue of God is not in them, the Feare of God is farre from them, and the Grace of God is not with them. Remember yee, that thus forget God, that as the day is past, that gaue light to the eyes, and darkenesse come, that shadoweth the Sunne: So the day of Life passeth away, and the night of Death approcheth, wherein (if we liue not in the light of grace, while it is to day) we shall neuer see the light of glorie to our comfort in the night of our bodies death. Therefore, before we betake vs to our rest, let vs commend our selues, and all that we haue, in faithfull prayer to God, calling together, & conioyning with our families, if we haue any; and in a holy and reuerent humiliation of bodies and mindes, fall downe before him, that seeth vs, and who hath promised to be in the midst of two or three gathered together in holy prayer.

Yet, Lord, we doe not, by this thy forbearance to punish vs, either iusti

of our affairs vnto thine own free mercie; and whatsoeuer crosse, losse, hurt or detriment hath be fallen vs this day, in bodies, goods, credit or reputation among men, we lay it, and impute it wholly and altogether vnto our sinnes, which haue worthily deserued much more then we feele, or are able to beare: what we or any of vs haue done against thee this day, thou knowest, what thou hast done for vs, wet cannot expresse with our lips, nor conceiue in our harts, for thy mercies are so infinite, and thy prouidence so high, and so farre past finding out, as the more we search and seek, to know the hid treasures of thy loue towards vs, so much the more ignorant we are of knowing what thou are: we therefore acknowledge our selues st

feeding, cloathing, and comforting our mortall bodies. In giuing vnto vs, & preseruing for vs many things for our vse; the beasts of the field, the plants of the earth haue beene seruiceable vnto vs, through thy blessing. Giue vs, we beseech thee, vnderstanding and feeling hearts to acknowledge thy mercies. Teach vs to know, and to take knowledge of our own wants, which are many; & grant that they may be supplied by thee. Let vs looke into our owne corruptions that they may bee reformed and weakened by thee: for Nature reuenleth not vnto vs our spirituall wants, nor can cleanse vs from our sinnes, which are many, and yet we account them few: great, and yet we see them not: weightie, and yet they seeme light vnto vs: we are spiritually poore, and spirituall▪ blinde, yet not poore in spirit, as we ought, we are rather barren of spirituall knowledge, and blinde to our owne imperfections, which puffeth vs vp with a vaine concei

we thinke it strong; our prayers are cold and weake, our minds and affections wauering, and inconstant in that diuine duty; yet would we seem religiously zealous. Thou findest in vs, Lord, these imperfections, and we dote of our owne merit, which is a meer forbidden presumption. Open, Lord, the eyes of our vnderstandings, that we may finde out, and feele our own errors, and looke into the working of thy grace, wherein thou acceptest vs, as poore in spirit, by the imputation of Christs humblenes, our faith perfect, through the perfection of his obedience: and our prayers auaileable through his preuailing mediation. So that thy spirituall consolations in Christ, are farre more abounding towards vs, then we are able to comprehend. Open therefore, Lord, the dore of thy diuine knowledge, that we may become wise in thee, and enter into that holy of holiest, in puritie of spirit, in faith sound, with prayers feruent, & thanks vnfained: Stirre vp in vs a greater measure of obedi

And as we are now come to the end of this day, and consequently haue finished the trauaile thereof, and now couet our rest: so we may watch for the euening of our dayes, and so labour while it is to day; that when the night of our last and finall sleepe shall ouertake vs, our workes may follow vs, not to condemne vs, nor as able to iustifie vs, but to witnes with vs, and for vs, that we haue not laboured altogether in thee in vaine: but according to that measure of grace, which thou art pleased to bestow vpon vs, we may worke out our saluation with feare and trembling.
                  Looke, Lord, vpon vs heere gathered together before thee, in a reuerend humiliation of our hearts. And because naturally we are obdurate, and our affections hardly brought vnder or subdued: subdue, Lord, all the rebellious imaginations,

that intrude now, or at any time into our thoughts: And let vs giue no entertainment vnto those desires, which tende to vanities, whether of the minde, of the will, or the pride of life. Let no euill accompany vs vnto our corporall rest, much lesse, Lord, vnto our finall sleepe. Let vs now begin to cast off the dregges of sinne, while we haue time. Let vs n

                     t put off our repentance vntill to morrow. Rather, as the day is past, that gaue vs corporall light, and the night come, threatning darknesse: let vs liue this night in thy spirituall light, and let the darknesse of sinne vanish, as the light of the day, neuer to rise againe vnto vs; That we beginning euen now to liue in that light which lighteneth the hearts of thy Saints, we may neuer ad

                     it the darknesse of vngodlines, to ouershadow vs againe. But let vs make vse of the night, not for sleepe only, but rather meditating of the resemblance the night hath with the state of impenitent sinners, who liuing out of thy fauour, are still in darknesse.

And as our sleepe resembleth our bodies rest in the graue: So giue vs grace, Lord, to consider, that we are euen at the end of our finall day, wherein we shall, vntill the day of our resurrection, commend our dust to dust, as we now for a night betake our bodies to our beds. And as we hope, and humbly desire thee, that our sleepe this night may be vnto vs more for the relieuing our wearinesse, then for wanton delight: So we likewise hope and desire, that when we shall lay downe our bodies in the graue, it may not bee as of the sauour of death vnto 
                        •
                     eath; but of life, vnto euerlasting life.
                  Grant, gracious Lord God, that thy power and prouidence may preserue vs safe in bodie and soule vntill the morning, that we may then betake vs againe vnto our lawfull callings: and that when our bodies shall rest in our graues, our soules may be preserued vnder thine Altar among the rest of thy Saints, vntill the most wished and glorious morning of our resurrection,

when wee shall no more returne vnto our labour, no more feare dangers, no more hunger, thirst, nor care for bodies necessaries, but for euermore enioy the most blessed Crowne of eternall glorie: which graunt, gracious Lord God, in, and for thy Christ, in whom all things for this life, and the life to come, are blessed vnto vs: to whome with thee, and the holy Ghost, bee ascribed all honour, power, Maiestie, and dominion, for euermore.
                  Amen.
                  O Lord encrease our faith, blesse vs and preserue vs this night, and for euermore. So be it.
               
               
                  
                  A short Prayer for the Euening, to be vsed of one man in priuate.
                  O Lord my God, mercifull and louing Father in Jesus Christ, I yceld thee humble thankes, for thy mercies, and louing fauours, shewed towards me this day past: wherein thou hast bountifully testified thy fatherly care of me, and hast largely dealt with me in the vse of thy good creatures. And as I haue found grace & fauor at thy hands this day, shorten not thy hand of comforts, now the night is come, wherein we are beset with many dangers, the more in regard of the darkenesse of the night, wherein all that worke wickednesse, take their fittest oportunities to worke their deuices. I haue no defence, thou knowest, no protection, no refuge, no meanes of safetie of my selfe, but all my helpe standeth in thy Name: Thy power and prouidence, Lord, is my sure defence, and the least measure of thy fauour is sufficient to deliuer me from an hoast of enemies: much

more from all the power, practice, & deuices of Sathan and his ministers: who howsoeuer subtilly they lay waite, and furiously assaile me; yet are they limited by thy power, and beyond the bounds of thy permission they cannot goe: onely my owne corrupt nature, and mine owne sinful inclination, make readiest way for their attempts. I am a sinner, not worthy to approch into thy presence: but as the poore Publicane, crying, Lord be mercifull vnto mee a sinner: Clense mee from my faults committed this day, wash me in the blood of the Lambe, that I bee not bard from thy presence, who refusest to heare sinners, among whom I am the greatest: & therfore in forgiuing me, the greater shall thy mercies appeare: and the more bound shall I bee vnto thee, who hast forgiuen much, and I shall loue thee much, in him whom thou louest most. In him heare me, & for him forgiue me: and let not the faults that I haue done this day, be registred against me in the heauens, nor reserued to be witnesses against me at the

day of mine account. Blot out of the booke of thy remembrance, my sinnes done yesterday, and to day: and henceforth guide me in so sincere and perfect obedience, that I sinne not, though darkenesse ouershadow my body. Let the light of thy loue shine in my soule, that although my bodie sleepe, and bee senceles of many dangers, thy prouidence may watch ouer me, and in my deadest slumbers preserue me: and the more the darkenesse of the night doth blind my corporal eyes: so much the more let me couet and obtaine the light of thy sauing countenance: That howsoeuer I haue through weakenesse, falne this day, I may be now raysed againe to newnesse of life, that I carry not the burden of my sinnes, vnto my bed, but cast them off as the rotten ragges of my naturall corruption: and being clensed, I may become more watchfull and constant, that the errors of darkenesse seize not vpon me: That the enemies of my present happinesse in thee, and of my future glory with thee, take not oportunitie, in the

time of my sleepe, or night wakings, either to plot or practise my hurt, or my soules trouble, by vaine dreames or feareful visions, which grow partly by the distemperature of our corrupt humors: but especially by Sathans temptations. And because, Lord, the night is as a closet of wandring fantasies, by reason of the darkenes thereof, wherin many vaine and idle imaginations arise to prouoke vs to euill, when sleepe ceaseth: let thy holy Spirit, O Lord, rule in my heart, and keepe the house of my soule, as the strong man, that the workes of darkenes creepe not into myheart: but as an holy prompter vnto my soule, he may stirre vp in me diuine meditations, and prayers, that my heart being truly and zealously exercised therein, in my wakings, I may admit no idle thought, to possesse the same, nor giue Sathan or mine owne corrupt affections, oportunity to snare me, and to seduce me from the works of the spirit, to the deeds of the flesh: but that sleeping and waking, I may euer rest vnder the shadow of thy

                     powerfull protection out of the 
                           •

                  A MOTIVE TO A Prayer for the members of Christ, to be vsed after priuate praiers in families.
               
                  IT were a matter much to be wondred at, that any member of a body should be so little carefull of it fellow members of the same bodie, as that it should not extend it vttermost power, to support and aide them all. As if the one hand should suffer violence, and the other should disdaine to assist it: or that the foote, or any other part should be annoyd: and the eye should scorne, to looke vnto it, or the hand to helpe it. How much more lamentable were it, if the members of our spirituall bodie, whereof Christ, our common Redeemer is the head, should not pray one for another? What can a man doe lesse for an ordinary friend, then to speake for him, to him that may steede him, being at no further charge or trouble, then to vse the breath of his mouth

for him? And shall wee thinke it too tedious a labor, to vse our petitions to God in the behalfe of such as are our fellow members, and our dearest brethren in Christ: being professors of his name with vs, and of the same fellowship, and communion together with vs; hauing the selfe same seales of adoption that we haue? God forbid. The neglect of which spirituall duetie, implyeth our want of loue vnto our head Christ, wherein we also breake the law of Christian Religion, which commands vs to loue our neighbours as our selues. If we then thinke it our dueties to pray for our selues, we ought to pray also for them; which Christ intendeth in teaching vs how to pray; not as in our owne names, my Father: But in the name of all the Church, Our Father, though vpon some particular occasions, a priuat mā
                   may vse it in the name of himselfe. But in generall supplications to God, it is a duetie inseparable in Christian Charitie, to pray one for another: yea, and for all men. Let vs therefore in all our priuate prayers, either with our families, or by ourselues, adde this consequent prayer, or to the like purpose; that wee discharging

that Christian duetie for others, God may the more esteeme our prayers for our selues, and stirre vp other faithfull members, to do the like for vs, which may be much comfortable to all: for the prayer of the faithfull auaileth much, if it bee feruent, Iam. 5. 16.
               
                  A Prayer for the members of Christ, whersoeuer dispersed, fit to bee vsed after our ordinarie prayers of Morning and Euening.
                  
                     GRacious Lord God, merciful and louing Father, the keeper and protector of all that truly professe the name of Christ thy Sonne: we the poore and weake members of that mysticall bodie, whereof he is the head, as feeling the wantes of our brethren, as our own, do here humblie present our petitions vnto thee for thy whole Church, and the members thereof howsoeuer, or whersoeuer distracted, dispersed, and▪ estranged, by nation, tongue, or place from vs. That it may please thee, who knowest who are thine, to haue a fatherly
                     
care ouer them: and whom thou hast already called to the knowledge of thy trueth, graunt them, Lord, mercifull, louing, and constant hearts, to stand in the profession thereof, without wauering or starting backe, call and incorporate such as are contrarily minded, and whom thou hast in thy fore-election appointed to saluation: That they also may be made of the same holy Communion with vs. And such as yet sit in darkenesse, & in the shadow of ignorance, by the seducements of the ministers of Antichrist, or of any other aduersaris▪ inlighten and bring home by thy word, vnto the sheepefold of the great Shepheard of our soules. Multiply thy sauing spirit vpon vs, and vpon all that belong vnto the kingdome of thy Sonne. A
                        ••
                      vouchsafe, good Father, to inlarge the harts, increase the knowledge, confirme the faith more and more, of all those that haue any chiefe place in Church or Commonwealth, Kings, Priests, and People. About the rest, Lord, open the heart of our King: giue him a complete

measure of true wisedome, not only in gouerning his subiects in due obedience to his owne lawes: but in a religious course of obeying & seruing of thee in holinesse and trueth. Protect and deliuer him from all plots, complotments and conspiracies, of whatsoeuer aduersaries, domesticall or forraine. Suffer not, Lord, the peace of thy Church, or Common-weale, to suffer violence, by ciuill tumults, treasons, or rebellions. Preserue his health, increase his strength, weaken his enemies, and confirme his crowne to his sonne, and his sonnes sonnes, to the end of time, Blesse and prosper in vertue and trueth, his Queene, and all that truly loue him, in and for thee, loue thou them, and comfort them: for thou hast made him a true maintainer of thy truth, & an enemie of all thine enemies. Blesse vnto him a godly, religious, and wise counsell: learned, zealous and painefull ministers, faithfull, religious, and truely loyall subiects: comfort, helpe, ayde, assist, and relieue all and euery true member of thy

Sonne: Those that are persecuted for thy truth, comfort, & confirme, that they may constantly endure vnto the end: Them that are weak, strengthen: Them that are poore and distressed, relieue: Cure or comfort those that are sicke. Many are the troubles of thine own children, Lord; and according to thy promise, deliuer them out of all: make them able to indure, and la

                      they shall be able to beare. Touch the hearts of all thy children, that they may be watching in prayer, considering the dayes wherein we liue are euill. And as thou hast promised to be present with vs, and with all thy children in their meetings before thee in prayer: Stir vs all vp, we beseech thee, to a more holy desire, to accompany one another, in that most holy exercise. And where one, two, or more prepare themselues to thee, in diuine supplications, assist them with thy holy Spirit, that all for one, and one for all, may pray vnto thee, in the name of our Redeemer, That all our hearts may agree in so holy

a harmony of praying one for another, as thou mayest be pleased to blesse vs all with peace in Christ, with plentie, health, and the vse of all necessaries for this life, and grace to obtaine the glory to come, for his sake, who hath euer bene, is, and shall be our Mediatour, our strength, and our Redeemer,

               A MOTIVE TO the confession of our sinnes to God, and to stirre vs vp to pray for the remission of the same.
               
               
                  THE beginning of our saluation, is the true confession and acknowledgement of our vnworthinesse, and to aske pardon for our sinnes in a liuely faith in Christ Iesus: For whose sake, God, faithfull and iust, hath promised to forgiue vs: So that

we neede not to feare to confesse our sinnes, seeing he that is faithfull and true, hath made vs a promise to forgiue vs. And therefore saith the Wise man, Be not ashamed to confesse thy sinnes, especially vnto God in Christ our Mediatour, who is not ignorant of our infirmities: but knoweth whereof we are made: he remembreth t
                     〈…〉
                   we are but dust, he was tempted as 
                     〈◊〉
                   are: but resisted the tempter, to teach vs, to withstand the assaults of Sathan, whom God permitteth to trie vs, to the end that we may striue to preuaile: and hauing sustained any foyle, falling into any sinne, that we might learne, that wee haue an aduocate with the Father, euen Iesus Christ t

                        〈◊〉
                     . Let vs not therefore be ashamed or afraid to confesse our sinnes to God; for it is the first steppe to Repentance: But men generally are more ashamed to confesse their sinnes that they haue committed, then they are to commit them, and more willingly doe they vndergoe the committing of sinne, then wisely to represse, or strongly to resist it: the knowledge of our sin
                     •
                  , and the confession of them, is the

chiefest token that we are in the way of saluation. And nothing more witnesseth against vs, then a purpose to hide our sins from God, or to thinke he seeth vs not; when in deed he not onely is priuie to all our outward actions, but knoweth our very thoughts long before. And therefore our pretence of conceiling our iniquities from him, aggrauateth the sinne, arguing, that God is not an all-knowing God: which implieth a denial of his omnipotence, and commeth neere vnto the foole that sayth in his heart, there is no God. Let vs therefore be wise in searching out our sinnes, which lurke vnder the cloude of our naturall blindnesse. Let vs obserue, whereunto wee are most inclinable, & what sin is our chiefest Dalilah, our corrupt hearts Delite: for howsoeuer men are subiect to many sinnes, yet there is one aboue the rest, a master sinne, which though all other sinnes seeme to hide their heads, when the stronger man, the spirit of God beginneth to possesse the house of our soules: y
                     ••
                   that predominant sinne wil hardly be cleane thrust out. And therefore are wee to bee wise as Serpents, to obserue and preuent sin,

and innocēt as Doues, to liue a godly life: which can neuer be, where sin of any sort beares the sway. If wee confesse them, God is faithfull and iust to forgiue them, according to his promise, which he hath also confirmed by many examples, Dauid, Paul, Peter, Mary Magda

                      transgressions out of thy remembrance: consider not, Lord, mi
                        〈…〉
                      offences, how readie I haue been

to embrace those forbidden fruits of the flesh, which being the sauour of death vnto death, and how wilfully I haue reiected the fruits of the Spirit, sauouring vnto life eternall. It is too much, Lord, that I brought death into the world with my life; but much more by adding actual to mine original transgression. There is no part within me or without me, free from deserued condemnation: my hart is corrupted, my tongue and lippes profane, mine eyes blinded, my hands defiled, my feet polluted, and all the members of my body stained with the filthines of sinne, sinfull sinne, sins of all sorts, committing things forbidden, and omitting things commanded: So that I cannot but confesse against my selfe, I am wholly not only sinfull, but a lump of sin it selfe, a puddle of putrifaction, a sinke of vncleannes, a gulfe of grosse impieties, and a carcasse of most filthie leprosie, full of spirituall rottennesse, vnworthy the light of the Sunne, to lighten my corporall eyes to see to do euill: not worthy to breathe in the ayre, to speake

euill, nor worthie to partake of the ordinary food of men, to strengthen my flesh the more to sinne, nor worthie to consort with humane societie, to make them sinfull by my sin. Oh wretch that I am; how haue I plunged my selfe into thy heauie displeasure? how haue I lost thy loue, who louest righteousnes, and hatest iniquitie? Oh wretch that I am, how haue I runne, without right reason, to my ruine rashly? Lord, I am vnfainedly sorie for my sinnes, and I long to be reconciled vnto thee; lest I goe to my graue with griefe, lest from the graue I should come into iudgement with horror, and be inforced to heare that fearefull and finall sentence of reprobatiō pronounced against 
                        〈◊〉

                      mercifull and louing, remember I am but dust: forget not how orignall sinne seazed vpon me, before I had sence or power to commit actuall sin: call to minde that I was conceiued and borne in sinne, and brought corruption in my flesh, frō my mothers wombe, which I could

not preuent. And although it be the rule of thy seuere Justice, to lay the guilt of parents vpō their children: yet let thy mercies which are aboue thy Judgemēts, shew themselues now, when else there is no hope.
                  Amen.

                  Another shorter prayer for forgiuenesse of sinnes.
                  O Heauenly father, thy promises are many, faithfull and comfortable. Thou wilt not the death of a sinner, but desirest rather that he should repent and liue. If thou then desirest rather that I liue then perish, giue me a repenting hart, renue a right spirit within me: reforme me, and I shall be reformed: for in me, Lord, there is no goodnes, no power, and as little will to doe good, but a will and power to do euill only. Let therefore thy grace worke effectually in me a new heart, a new minde, new affections, holy and sanctified: So

shall sin become lothsome vnto me, which I haue loued: and holines of life shal be sweet vnto me, which I haue neglected: thy Commandements that I haue transgressed, I shall indeuour to fulfill: thy patience which I haue abused, I wil answere with more filiall obediēce. The curses then, that I haue deserued, shal be turnd into blessings: and I shall frame the residue of my life in better actions: I shall abandon, as deceiuing vanities, those sinnes wherin I haue delited, and shal shun the baits wherwith Satan hath allured me to sin, and whereunto I consented, by the vanity of mine vnregenerate affections. Oh pardon, pardon my sins good Father in Iesus Christ, fill my hart with the liuely apprehension of thy mercies: speake peace vnto my sad and sorrowfull soule: reuiue my dead & distracted thoughts plunged in despaire: cast thine ey

                      mediator for me; heare me a sinner, for his sake, and pardon me for thy

mercies sake. Take me now, Lord, out of the dungeon of feare, wherin I haue bin long a captiue, sold vnder sin. Set me now free from the danger of death and hell. Let Satan flie and fall before my face. Let sin haue no more power ouer me: receiue me into thy fauour: assure me of full and free remission of my sinnes in Christ: worke true peace in my conscience. The sting of death being broken, the feare of the iudgement to come, may be turned into a liuely assurance of saluation; that white I liue here, I may euermore feele the liuely worke of thy holy Spirit in me. Make the residue of my dayes, the dayes of vnfained mourning for my former offences, and of a most vpright and righteous conuersation to come: and let faith euermore preuaile against all future temptations, that I may finish the course of my life in that peace which proceedeth of perfect loue, which loue bringeth forth filiall obedience vnto thee, which obedience is more acceptable in thy fight, then the sacrifices of bullocks and goates. Accept me now, good

Father, in Iesus Christ, into thy fauour, remit my sinnes, number me amongst thine elect, and seale me vp in thy mercies against the day of my finall visitation. Heare me, O Lord, and let thy holy Spirit guide mee euer vnto that day, through Christ my Sauiour, my Mediator, my Strength, and my redeemer.
                  Amen.
                  O Lord increase my faith, and pardon my sinnes.
               
            
            
               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer, for a godly and holy life, and for power of resisting Satan and sinne.
               
               
                  THe course of euery mans life declar's what kind of man he is, whether carnal or spiritual; for as the tree is knowne by his fruit, so is euery man known of men by his life & conuersation. And it is much to be lamented, that men, though carnally

minded, will iustifie themselues, and make protestation of their hope, that they shall be saued, as well as he that walketh most sincerely before God and men. And this out of a voluntarie ignorance and blindnesse, in not knowing, and truly distinguishing betweene the wayes of sanctitie and sinne: the first leading to heauen and eternall life, through grace and faith in Christ: the other to hell and reprobation, through our owne corruption, by the obeying the will of Satan. It is more then wonderfull to obserue the courses of carnall men, who pretend that they are trauelling to that blessed New Ierusalem, and yet take the direct way to Cursed Ierico: they couet, in conceit, to ascend the holy hill of Sion, and yet will not leaue that wicked Babylon. They professe to liue after the Spirit, but doe the workes of the Flesh. They would seeme to liue in Light, but behold, they are in Darknes: not considering that he that liues after the flesh, shall die: yet how loth are carnall men to leaue the way that leadeth to destruction, and how vnapt and vnwilling to walke in the way of life, which is Christ? in whom, if we

truely beleeue, we walke in him; if we truly walke in him, we truely liue in him, and that life is the summe and end of all our hope; it is the marke whereat we ayme all our holy endeuours. Let vs therefore determine with our selues, and constantly resolue to walke before God, and to be vpright. Let vs make our supplications in his presence, with our whole hearts. And let vs duely consider our wayes, what they haue beene. And let vs now turne our feete vnto his testimonies. Let vs strengthen and confirme our resolutions of a godly life, by continuall prayer: otherwise, what good we determine to day, will be repented to morrow, and we through our weaknes shall fall againe, contrarie to our godly resolutions. Our supplications to God for his assistance, and strengthening of our resolued reformation, must be continuall, because our spirituall aduersaries are continually working, to seduce vs out of the way of a sanctified life. A ship, as soone as her sailes are hoised, feeles the winde, and begins to make way: if then there be no skilfull pilote at the helme to steere, shee either rusheth vpon some rocke, or

driues the contrarie course. So are mens affections swayed with the good or euill spirit. Needs there not therefore a wise consultation of all the sences of the inner and outer man, how to steere the affections aright? which, as the sailes are to the ship, so are they vnto the minde; for, being once hoised, they carrie the desires, as the sailes the hull; and if it want right reason to steere it, it neuer can shape the course of godlines. Let vs therefore pray, that we may be able to manage the ship of our affections to the port of true obedience, in a sincere course of life. And happie is that man, that truly determines, constantly continues, faithfully prayeth, and wisely considers the course of his life, and euer remembreth his end.
               
                  A Prayer for a godly life, and to resist sinne and Sathan.
                  O God my God in Iesus Christ, maker and creator of all things, gouernour of heauen and earth, preseruer of our soules and bodies, the giuer of life & light: The framer & disposer of all right and religious hearts, The perfecter,

and finisher of our faith. In, & by whom are all things, and without whom nothing can haue any being: Much lesse corrupt man, haue any existence in life, though be seeme to liue in the body, except thou liue in him: for our life, which is our saluation, and our glory, and our crowne, is hidde with thee in Christ. Such is thy mercy towards vs, as thou vouchsafest to shew vs, our blessed being with thee in the heauens, in this our mortalitie in part, as in a glasse: lest wee should faint in our trials, powre down

of death in me. Settle mine affections vpon the hid treasures of thy loue, guide & garde me, with thy sauing power, instruct me in the way of true wisedome: Adorne me with all thy spirituall graces, and diuine vertues: sow in me the seedes of sanctity, water me with the dew of thy holy Spirit: purifie and cleanse my heart, rectifie mine affections, blesse my godly enterprises and holy endeauours, frame all the parts, powers, faculties and sences of my soule and bodie, that they may all meete in the loue of thee, and euery one performe his office, according to the greatnesse of thy name: Let my heart harbour holy thoughts, let my will euer be framed after thy word; let mine vnderstanding bee manifested by righteousnesse, and a sanctified life: let my memorie neuer let

That I being thus clensed, and reformed, I may walke euer in thy faith, liue euer in thy feare: and at the last, yeeld my body to the graue, in thy fauour: where the power and sting of death shall faile of further pursuing me: and there shall I leaue that sinning part, vntill it shall bee made a shining part with my soule, by the brightnesse & glory of thy presence in the heauens: Thy goodnesse and mercy shewed vnto sinners in this life, leadeth the seriously penitent, and truely faithfull, to the consideration of their present weakenesse, wants, and imperfections, and to the contemplation of their future fulnesse of ioy, comfort, and euer-continuing consolation. O stirre vp in me a liuely hunger and thirst for spirituall graces in this life, where we are pressed downe with a mighty masse of corruption, and compassed about with a darke cloud of errors: Insomuch as I, a man begotten, conceiued and borne in sinne; can neuer be able to stand vnder the burden of the one: or to comprehend thee, my Light, and my saluation, through the other. How

then, Lord, shall I be able to walke in thee, who art the true way: vnderstand thee, the sauing trueth, or attaine vnto thee, being eternall life? Therefore Lord, vouchsafe to inlarge my heart in all godly forwardnesse, to proceede from knowledge to knowledge, from faith to faith, from one diuine grace to another: vntill I attaine to full perfection in Christ, in whom all our holy indenours be euermore blessed, sinne euermore weakened, and all goodnesse euermore increased. But many are the blockes, which Sathan layeth, and couereth them with the vayle of pleasure and profite, which make many to stumble and fall. Many ministers hee vseth, to snare vs, and many miseries and mischiefes hee plotreth and practiseth against vs, to dismay vs from following of thee: but hee hath not so many agents, to allure, or terrifie vs, as thou, Lord, hast meanes to preuent the one, and to defend vs in the other. Plead thou therefore my cause, and defend me against that spirituall enemie, that fighteth against me; leaue me not

in his power, shorten the extent of his chaine, breake his teeth, that he may haue no power to seize vpon me, weaken the poyson of his inchantments, that he pollute in me neither the will nor the deede: That I may leade my life vnspotted in the world, and that all mine actions and indeauours may prosper: that sinne, that hangeth on so fast, may be cast off: And giue me a sound knowledge of thy good pleasure, that I may truely determine to shake cleane off the vnprofitable workes of darkenesse, and be truly clothed with the holy robes of righteousnesse, and sanctity: That I may be euer able and ready to pray vnto thee, & obtaine at thy hands, the direction to liue vprightly in thy sight: and that I may euer consider mine owne weakenesse, and imperfections; to the end I may indeauour to keepe a good conscience in all mine actions: for, as our sences, and the members of our bodie, are many, and euery one subiect to sundry infirmities and temptations: and euery of our actions open to diuers infections and

pollutions: So, Lord, I beseech thee, to blesse all, and euery part of my soule and bodie, in all holinesse and sanctity, that in all my life I may truely walke before thee, in

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer before the receiuing of the holy Communion, or the Lords Supper.
               
               
                  THis holy Sacrament is called the Lords Supper: because Christ Iesus did institute the same, at his last Supper with his Disciples. It is called the holy Communion, because many faithfull communicate together at this holy Table, as common partakers together of the body and blood of Christ. It is left vnto vs, to be receiued of vs, as a seale of

our adoption into the inheritance of that newe Ierusalem, purchased by Christ. It is a mysterie, and therefore not vnderstood, according to the spirituall end, by the outward and carnall eating and drinking of the bread and wine, which are onely visible signes of an inuisible vertue: which maketh the worthy and truely faithfull receiuers, liuely members of Christes mysticall bodie. And yet not euery one that partaketh of this holy Table, is therefore a member of Christ; for, the outward communicating, not only auayleth nothing to the vnworthy Receiuer, but turneth to his greater condemnation, as appeareth in Iudas. And therefore a most fearefull thing it is, to presume to come to this holy Table, with an vnprepared heart, though aswell the vnworthy, as the worthy Receiuers, vnderstand by the letter of the word, that the Body of Christ, crucified vpon the Crosse, is signified by the Bread, & his blood shed, signified by the powring out of the wine: yet how the Receiuer doth eate the flesh, and drinke the blood of Christ, euery Receiuer vnderstandeth not: And therefore a dangerous presumption

it is, lightly and rashly to presse to this holy Table, as if the bread and wine were of ordinary vse, the taste and verdure of either differing nothing, to the carnall sence, from ordinary bread and wine. But such is the spirituall vse, as it worketh either to the saluation, or damnation of euery one that receiueth: Euery man receiueth, as he is prepared in his heart. The godly affected and sanctified, that haue truely tasted, and do retaine the grace of Gods holy Spirit, bringing forth fruits worthy amendment of life, partake worthy of this holy mystery. But they that remaine in their sinnes, carnally minded, such as delite in the workes of darkenesse, worldly and fleshly vanities: what shew soeuer they make of the outward reuerent receiuing of this blessed Sacrament, they doe but eat and drinke their owne damnation: because they make no distinction or difference betweene this holy Table, and the ordinary table of carnall meates▪ They onely feele, and feede on the visible signes: but the spirituall and inuisible grace, they taste not of. Therefore it behooueth all that purpose

to communicate at this holy Table, first to examine how they stand prepared, or vnprepared; if they find themselues fit to partake of this heauenly mysterie, it will appeare in their regeneration and renewed life, by truely belieuing in the name of Christ Jesus, by vnfeinedly louing one another, as Christ commanded: by well weighing, and duely considering their wayes, and turning themselues, in faith and obedience to the commandements of God: by truely repenting their sinnes, and applying their hearts to righteousnesse, and true holinesse. He that is not thus prepared, but continueth in his sinnes, in infidelitie and disobedience, ought to forbeare this holy Sacrament, and to imploy his heart to search all his imperfections, to seeke the meanes of reformation, by the ministerie of the word, and prayer: left he come to this holy▪ Table, thinking to please God with a bare shew of Religion, hauing neither faith nor repentance, offering the sacrifice of fooles. And so in stead of remission of sinnes promised to the worthy Receiuer, hee increase his owne

condemnation, by vnworthy receiuing.
               
                  A Prayer to bee said, before the receiuing of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ.
                  O Gracious Lord God, Father of our Sauiour Christ Iesus, and in him ours: I thy poore creature, wretched and ful of sinne, doe here humbly fall downe in thy presence, to be partaker of that holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of that Lambe that taketh away the sinnes of the world; Iesus Christ, who tooke vpon him the burden of thy heauy indignation▪ inkindled against all the sonnes of sinning Adam, and refused not the ignominious death of the crosse; to take away the curse, which lay vpon all mankind, pressing vs all downe euen to the hels: & hath redeemed againe into thy fauour, and reconciled to thy grace, as many as truly beleeue in his death & satisfaction. Thy mercy, Lord, did it, wonderfull in our eyes: yea, a worke beyond the apprehension of humane

wisedome, a mystery incomprehensible. Open therefore the eyes of our spirituall vnderstandings, that we may comprehend, and take holde by a liuely faith, of the free remission of our sinnes, and consequently of our reall, and perfect adoption into the right of inheritance of eternall glory with Christ in the heauens: Reueale, Lord God, euer louing, this most hidde and heauenly mysterie, vnto euery one here gathered together, to partake of this holy Table: and giue vs vnderstanding hearts, truly to know, what a high and heauenly mystery we here are to communicate: for we cannot but acknowledge, that although the creatures, whereof we desire corporally to partake, be visible, and our eating the bread, and drinking the wine, be vnto vs in taste and verdure, as are other like bread & wine: yet there is an inuisible, and spirituall operation, in the worthy and vnworthy receiuing: namely, saluation or damnation; as appeareth in that vnworthy, and most wicked Judas. But good Father,

as he was marked from among the rest of thy Disciples to reprobation: let this thine holy ordinance be a sure seale vnto vs of our saluation, howsoeuer vnable we are to comprehend the height & depth of thy great mercie and wisedome, which in this most holy Communion, thou offerest for the saluation of all worthy receiuers. But who, Lord, can account himselfe worthy? who dare presume to approch vnto this holy and heauenly Banquet of the Lambe, as of his owne merit, to partake worthily? How can sinfull man, by eating the bread, and drinking the wine, assure himselfe of remission of his sinnes, not being spiritually instructed in this heauenly mystery? Sinne and sanctitie, truth and error, light and darknesse, agree not: and therefore man, as he is in himselfe by nature corrupt, ignorant, and in the shadow of death, cannot worthily partake of this mystical banquet of the body and bloud of thy Sonne our Sauiour, without the inward working of thy grace in his heart, whereby it may please thee to giue

him a liuely feeling of his imperfections, a desire and power to cast off the lothsome clogge of sin, and to be truely sanctified to the participation of so effectuall a meane to obtaine saluation. But how farre we wretched sinners, heere gathered together, are short of feeling our own wants of power to cast off our sinnes; and how far from true sanctification, thou knowest. And therfore, louing Father in Iesus Christ, clense thou vs, and wee shall bee cleane, sanctifie vs, and we shall be holy: and though our imperfections be great, though our faith be weak, we shall be made perfect, and our obedience confirmed by the sincerity of the obedience of Christ our Sauiour, whose righteousnes and merits are made ours, by thy fatherly and free imputation, requiring of vs, mortall men, only to beleeue: I beleeue, Lord, help mine vnbeliefe, that I may lift vp a pure heart vnto thee, begge faithfully of thee, and receiue plentifully from thee all spirituall graces; that I comming vnto this holy table, hauing fully cast off the habite of sinne, may be

clothed with the sacred Robe of Christs Innocencie, and be found among the rest of thy Saints, hauing on that heauenly wedding garment; that I be not taken from this holy Table, thrust out with shame and horror into the place of weeping and gnashing of teeth. Remember not our offences, Lord, burie them in the graue of euerlasting forgetfulnesse, forget not whereof we are made, and be not vnmindefull what an armie of spirituall enemies doe continually assayle vs, and how in our most deuotest and most religious actions and exercises, they are most busie to seduce and circumuent vs. Assist vs therefore, Lord, and be thou on our side, grace vs now with thy blessed presence, that we may heere offer vp vnto thee our soules and bodies, a holy, liuely, and acceptable sacrifice, and become worthie Receiuers of this holy Mysterie; that as we eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup, we may truly find an effectual mortification of our sinning part, and a liuely vi

                     ification, and regeneration of our spirituall part,

and may be more and more changes in our liues, that we may walk before thee, and be vpright, from hencefoorth all the dayes of our earthly pilgrimage; and teach vs euer more and more to obey and loue him, who so infinitly loued vs, that he contented himselfe to giue his bodie to be crucified, and his bloud to be shed for vs: which great loue of his being heere represented vnto vs, by these thy visible creatures of bread and wine, giue vs truely and faithfully beleeuing hearts, that we may worthily receiue them, and rightly retaine the reuerend memorie of his death, and be euer the better enabled to resist, and abandon sinne; and cleaue vnto righteousnes, al the dayes of our liues; that at his comming againe we may be raised, and ascend with him, as members sanctified, and heires adopted into that inheritance, which he purchased with his bloud in heauen. Graciously grant this, O Father, for his sake that suffered that ignominious death and seale vp in our consciences, by thy holy Spirit, a full and liuely

assurance that wee are truly ingrafted into him our head, and in, and by, and with him shall liue, eternally glorified in heauen,
                  Amen.
                  Lord increase our faith, and prepare our hearts to a faithfull and reuerend receiuing of this holy Sacrament, to our soules comfort.
               
            
            
               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer to be said after the receiuing of the Lords Supper.
               
               
                  IT is a dangerous thing, vpon the recouerie of health after sicknes, to suffer a relapse, and falling downe againe: but much more dangerous to fall into new sinnes after repentance, and reconciliation with God. A man hauing polluted himselfe with pitch, and being clensed, is worthy to suffer shame, if he wallow in it againe. How much more shamefull is it for a man, that

hath vowed reformation of his corrupt life, and to forsake his sins, and hath thereupon receiued, in token of forgiuenesse, the seale of Gods promise, the Sacrament of the bodie and bloud of Christ, to binde him, vpon paine of condemnation, to new obedience, if he wilfully fall backe againe. Thou therefore, whatsoeuer thou be, that hast beene partaker of this holy and most sacred mysterie, remember what thou hast done, how thou hast eaten thy saluation, or damnation, for there is not a meane betweene this; if therefore thou (hauing beene a guest at this heauenly Feast) feele in thy selfe, a heart not so well formerly prepared, as the holy Ghost commandeth, retaining still the froth and filth of thy sinnes, begin now to cast them off, and put on instantly the wedding garment of true regeneration, that thou mayest be found worthie to sit at this holy Table, and to partake of the sauing food of thy soule, by chewing the cudde of continuing repentance, and newnesse of life, heere, that hereafter thou mayest enioy the fruits of thy new birth with Christ in heauen. And for as much as

no man hath power of himselfe to performe that obedience in the inner man, which he may promise by outward words, there is no surer or more preuailing meanes then prayer. And therefore, it behoueth thee to continue and end this heauenly exercise, with hartie prayer to God in the same Christ, that he would be pleased for that his Sons sake, to accept thee into the inseperable societie of his Elect Saints. And let not this desire be as a pusse of winde, or as a flame suddenly quenched, but let it be a daily exercise, to meditate of this thy holy vnion with Christ, that thy backe sliding to sinne heap not vp a more heauie weight of condemnation against thee in the time of thine account, when it will be demanded how thou presumest to come to that holy Table without the habite of true faith and obedience: it will not boote thee to say thou camest for feare of the law, or for company, with the congregation; for who so commeth not for, and apprehendeth not inward and spirituall comfort, commeth vnworthily, and he that falleth to his old sins againe, hath eaten this Spirituall bread, and

drunke of that Spirituall rocke, which is Christ, to his owne damnation.
               O Lord increase my faith.
               
                  A Prayer to be said after the receiuing of the holy Communion.
                  GReat, good, and most gracious Lord God, the Author and finisher of our faith, who of thy free fauour, hast now vouchsafed me to be a guest at this thy heauenly banquet, where I haue beene refreshed, not so much with the visible creatures of bread and wine, for the strengthening of my weake bodie, which without thy corporall nutriment cannot long indure: But with the heauenly Manna, the food of the soules of thy Saints, the blessed body and bloud of that immaculate Lambe, who sealed our attonement with thee, with his bloud vpon the ignominious and grieuous crosse, and there cancelled the hand-writing, which was against vs; and of the bond
                     
                        ••
                     aues of Satan, made vs the free men of the new Jerusalem, and

in our nature, and for vs, and in our behalfes, triumphed ouer Satan, Death, and Hell, and now, Lord, as it hath pleased thee to accept me into this holy communion, and to make me partaker of that most holy mystery, by the outward receiuing of visible bread & wine: worke, gracious Lord, in me a true, liuely, and spiritual feeling of the grace which thou hast promised vnto all worthy Receiuers. And for as much as our assurance dependeth vpon thy promise, and thy promise confirmed vnto vs by a liuely faith; and that faith is thine owne free gift also, by the operation of thy holy Spirit: worke in me, Lord, this faith, that may confirme vnto mee the effect of thy promise, the free forgiuenesse of my sinues, newnes of life, a holy and sanctified conuersation, a right reuerend vse of all thy creatures, a religious feare to offend thee, and vnfained loue of thee in Christ: that as I haue bin now a partaker of the outward elemēts, I may also and absolutely partake of the inuisible grace, that my soule may be liuely and continually fed

with that heauenly bread, which maketh our soules strong in and by him, whose bodie and bloud I haue here sacramentally eaten & drunke, and thereby through faith am vnited euen of thy free mercie vnto, and made one with thee in him, in whom, whosoeuer is truly ingrafted, shall liue for euer in the glorious heauens with him, as coheires of that endlesse Kingdome of glory, which he purchased by his obedience to the death of the Crosse. Good father, let the remembrance of that his death be so imprinted in my hart this day, that I neuer forget it, but couet to renue, and continually retaine the remembrance thereof, by often communicating at this holy Table, which, though it be as a snare vnto the vnworthy partakers, it is a sure seale of saluation to the faithfull & truly penitent. And therefore, good Father, confirme my repentace, renue mine obedience, strengthen my faith: Make me a liuely member of Christ, that as I haue this day promised to become a new creature, and thou hast renued againe to me,

thy promise of remission of my sins, and of my reconciliation with thee, through the bloud of the Lambe: Let this holy, and heauenly condition be truely performed in my behalfe, for euer. So shall I be assured, that thou wilt neuer faile in thy sacred couenant of grace to me, being euer the same, yea, and Amen. Thou, Lord, knowest my strong corruptions, and the feeblenesse of my naturall power to resist sinne, and what strong and powerfull aduersaries there lie in wayte for my soule, laying continuall snares to entangle mee anew, to make (if it were possible) this my reuniting into thee in Christ of none effect, and to seduce me again into the wayes of vngodlines. But good Father, preuent me with thy grace, that as I haue promised this day to forsake sinne, and cleaue vnto righteousnesse, so I may performe and perseuere in a sanctified life vnto my liues end, through Christour Lord.
                  Lord increase and confirme my faith euermore.
               
            
            
               
               A MOTIVE TO a Prayer to be sayd of a man in any kind of trouble.
               
               
                  ALthough the word of God do approue Afflictiō
                   to be necessary for them that shall be saued: yet is it otherwise thought, and helde of the carnall man, who can hardly beleeue, that it is a token of the loue of God towards him: hee rather perswades himselfe, that when God sends him great increase of Cattell, Corne, Oyle, Wine, Health, Worldly prosperitie, and the pleasures of this life, that then God loues him. But how farre hee is deceiued, the holy Ghost declareth by the Prophet Dauid, who confessed, that it was good for him, that he was afflicted. And Christ himselfe affirmeth, that through many troubles, his Saint
                        •
                      must enter into the kingdome of heauen: Not by pleasures, delites of the flesh, and vanities of the mind. If we did remember the sentence pronounced for Lazarus, and against the Rich man,
                  
and did duely consider it, we could not but thinke prosperitie rather dangerous then delightfull: and that a meane estate is more profitable then painefull. Thou hast receiued thy pleasure, saith Abraham, but contrarily, Lazarus indured paine: Therefore art thou tormented, and he is comforted. No other reason is alleadged of either sentence, & yet neither of them is said to be punished, or preserued, for the ill or good that the one or other did. Onely fulnesse, and want, plenty, and penurie, pleasure and paine, are said to be the causes of either condition: Not that the ones riches in themselues deserued damnation, but the abuse: or that the others pouertie deserued saluation: but his patience, which yet was not the cause, but the effect of Gods election: And the others abuse of the blessings of God, an argument of his reprobatiō. But God, to preuent the grosse fruits of corruption in vs, maketh our powers weake, and our willes thereby the more conformable to his will. As Physicke often preuenteth a disease that begins to seaze on the bodie, and for the time, is harsh, lothsome, bitter, and much

vnsauorie, yet salutary in the end. So is Affliction of whatsoeuer kinde, medicinable, to such as can brooke, and digest it through faith, patience and prayer, and bringeth the affections into a sanctified temper. That the vnholy humours of pride, arrogancie, auarice, lust, and other corporall and earthly vanities, oppresse not the soule, which is carried, by the violence of superfluous vanities, into many noysome desires: and consequently into infinite hazards of making shipwracke of saluation. Take it not therefore heauily, whatsoeuer thou art, that art visited with whatsoeuer crosse, or triall, although in it own nature it be euill, being a punishment of sinne: for he that made the bitter waters of Mara sweet, and changed the nature thereof for his Israels sake, hath changed the nature of the crosse, to them that are his, insomuch, as they not onely find comfort in it: But many sweet effects, it bringeth foorth, making them glorious in their basenesse, rich in their pouertie, strong in their weakenesse, and liuely in their seeming death. Moreouer, it causeth vs to see how

iust, how prouident, and how mercifull the Lord is, how weake and miserable all mankind is: And how fickle, how inconstant, and false the world is. It beates downe the pride of nature, and humbles vs, that we are not so prone and apt to sinne, as when wee haue prosperitie at will. As our sins and transgressions are the fruits of our corruptions: So are afflictions and crosses necessarie, to mortifie them, and to preuent their increase. To speake of the kindes of trouble, they are many: yet may be reduced, vnder these three heads: pouertie, sicknesse, enemies: vnder the first, are comprehended the want of al necessaries: vnder the second, the griefes of body and mind: and vnder the third, whatsoeuer is aduersarie vnto vs. And therefore, the prayer following, is fit to be vsed in any of these, that the Lord will be either pleased to remoue them, to moderate their extremitie, or to giue patience to vndergoe it.
               
                  
                  A generall meditation or prayer in whatsoeuer trouble or crosse.
                  GRacious and most mercifull Lord God, whose wisedome is past finding out, and whose prouidence disposeth of all the estates of men, in mercy and iudgement: thou liftest out of the dunghill, the humbled poore, and hurlest downe the mightie: thou giuest & takest, when, what, from whom, and wherefore it pleaseth thee: All thy wayes, O God, are mercie and truth, to them that feare thee: Thou Lord, art righteous in all thy workes, and holy in all thy wayes. Howsoeuer thou correctest thy children, it is for their purgation, to clense them from the rust, and drosse of their corruptions: And makest pouerty, sickenesse, enemies, and all crosses, not onely not burdensome or irkesome vnto thine, but sweete and easse to be borne: though the naturall man seeme to kicke against them, the man regenerate, and borne a new of the holy Ghost, imbraceth them as the true tokens

of thy fatherly affection towards him: who hauing learned out of thy sacred word, that through many troubles, thy Saints must enter into ioy, and through disgrace into glory: Hee feareth most, when he is most free from crosses; left that he should not be of the number of them that shalbe saued, whose saluation is the more certaine, by how much thou correctest him by thy fatherly visitations. All flesh is corrupt, and all men sinners. Thou therefore, who art iust, cleane, and pure in all thy wayes and workes, canst not but vse thy rod of gentle corrections, vpon them whom thou louest in Iesus Christ: But lettest the wicked, either to lie securely in a reprobate sence, or to lay thy heauy iudgement vpon them, euen in this life, where they begin their condemnation. But good Father, Enter not into iudgement with mee: Let not thy corrections become curses vnto me: but rather, Lord, let them be meerely medicines to cure the disease of sinne in me. So shall I, by the working of thy holy spirit, become more and more mortif

in the affections of my heart, which are then most offending thy Maiestie, when I am in greatest securitie: And therefore, louing father, take from me all grudging, discontent of mind, and murmuring against thy corrections, of what kind or qualitie soeuer they be: for thou hast testified vnto vs by thy word, that thou scourgest euery sonne thou receiuest. And therefore, he that wanteth thy fatherly chastisements, seemeth to be a bastard and no sonne. And forasmuch, Lord, as the causes of mens troubles in this life be many, and hidden, some to correct for sinnes alreadie committed, some to preuent sinnes, whereunto we are inclinable, and some to manifest thy power, by way of iudgement against the impenitēt wicked: Take Lord, away from the eyes of my darke vnderstanding, the vayle of ignorance, that I may see and feele in my conscience, a sure testimonie of thy sauing spirit; that thy corrections light not vpon me in iudgement, but in mercy, not to condemn me, but to approue me to be one of

thy Church militant, whose members haue their continuing afflictions, which howsoeuer outwardly they seeme to blemish them, yet doe they make them beautifull within, and most amiable vnto thee, howsoeuer wee seeme vnto the world, outcastes & castawayes: yet are we thereby made the more like vnto our Sauiour, who procured out saluation through affliction. And thereby thou, Lord, knowing our weakenesse, to vndergoe his crosses, lay no more vpon me then withall thou mayest be pleased to giue mee grace and strength to beare it, according to thy promise: and then lay vpon me what thou wilt, pouertie, sicknesse, enemies, and whatsoeuer crosses may make me likest vnto thy sonne in his patient sufferings: although I haue learned, Lord, that all the afflictions of this life, are not worthy of the glory that shal be shewed in the life that is to come. And therefore, Lord, assist me with thy grace, that I with patience and godly reioycing, may vndergoe whatsoeuer it shall please thee to

lay vpon me: As did Saint Paul, Silas, Saint Peter, and other thine Apostles, who imbraced all thy corrections, and their troubles for thy names sake, with heauenly alacritie, and spirituall consolation.
                  O Lord increase my faitli.
               
            
            
               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer to be said in pouerty and want of this lifes necessaries.
               
               
                  OF all the miseries, that can befall a man in this mortall life, none is more bitter, and burdensome, then pouertie, and want of this lifes necessaries. And therefore we may obserue, how all men generally striue to auoyd it, by meanes lawfull or vnlawfull. It made Iacob to pray for sufficiencie, left want should constraine him to vniust meanes to supply his necessities namely, to clothe and feed himselfe▪ and them that he hath committed to his eare: for there is no other reall

want to bee complained of, but the want of food and rayment: if a man haue to sustaine nature in the meanest measure, and to couer his nakednesse in the basest manner, and be free from danger of debt, and be not an idle, but a diligēt man in some lawfull calling, he hauing the feare of God, cannot be said a poore man; for the feare of God maketh him wise, and wisdome maketh him patient, & patiēce cōtent, & he that is cōtēt in this mean estate; is rich. He that treasures vp the word of God in his soule, though he haue neither Siluer nor Gold, he may be rich, as Peter, who wāting these, was yet rich in all Christian vertues, and much beloued of the Lord; and vpon such poore men doth the Lord cast his fatherly and louing countenance, he watcheth ouer them, and feedeth them: Harken, my beloued brethren (saith Saint Iames) hath not God chosen the poore of this world, that they should be rich in faith, and heires of the Kingdom, which he promised to them that loue him? God preferreth the poor in worldly goods, being faithfull and iust, before the vnfaithfull rich; howsoeuer carnal iudgement maketh great differēce between

the worldly rich, whom it reuerenceth, and the corporall poore, whom it scorneth. But let the bodily poore, whome the Lord hath inriched with spirituall graces, reioyce in their tribulations; for God hath prouided for them a Citie, a Crowne, glorie, and immortalitie; where they shall neither want siluer, gold, rayment, food, or any necessaries: for the Lord Christ shal be vnto them all in all things. But it is to be vnderstood, that it is not the pouertie of any, that can deserue these future fauours, but they are the free gifts of God in Christ to the godly poore, not prouided for the idle prophane, wicked, and dissolute, that assume vnto themselues voluntary beggerie, or consume their corporall meanes lewdly, and so become poore, vsing no lawfull calling, to maintaine and support their estates; when they shall pleade their pouertie and mise

                  ALmightie Lord God, most powerfull, and most louing, I humbly recommend my selfe into thy holy protection, and to thy fatherly prouidence, who madestine and createdst me of nothing, and I came into this world poore and wretched, bringing nothing with me but nakednes, and original miserie, more hardly bested (of mine owne power) then the beast that perisheth. And in this manner all men came, and daily come into the world, from Adam to the last that shall be borne into the earth: yet in thy great and vnsearchable wisedome, thou disposest of men in diuers

maners, according vnto thine owne will. Some, Lord, thou makest Princes of the world, some abiects in the world; and yet neither the greatest, nor the meanest, by their high or low estate can bee iudged by humane reason, happy or vnhappy, Teach me therefore true wisedome, Lord, that I may rightly conceiue and iudge of mine owne

                      by thy grace: because it is thy will that I should be poore in worldly, make me so much the more rich in heauenly things. So shall I bo

                      my portion, Lord, great and glorious,

howsoeuer I seeme outwardly base and abiect. It is manifest, that thou causest the Sun to shine, and the raine to fall vpon the good, and the wicked. So giuest thou and distributest riches and pouertie, to the iust, and vniust, but to diuers ends: and they likewise receiue and vse them diuersly; the first, both riches and pouertie, to one only end, namely, to thy glory, and their own true comfort, being rich, as if they were poore, being poore, as if they possessed all things: and this by the working of thy holy Spirit on their sanctified hearts. Sanctiste my heart therefore, Lord, and giue mee patience, and a truely contented minde, in my greatest wants, and vnfained thankfulnesse, for the least supplie or encrease of thy bountie towards me, and let not my poore estate direct me, as it doth the hypocrites, who in prosperitie waxe proud, and in pouertie grudge and murmure, and so offend thy Maiestie, who workest all for the best, to them that are thine: my weakenesse by Nature, I confesse to bee such,

as I am prone to fall both in fulnes and in want. And were I not vpholden by thy grace, I should in the one run headlong into many noysome iustes, and forbidden vauities: and by the other, into vniust dealing to supplie m

thy word, he then found and confessed that it was good for him, that thou haddest afflicted him. Lord, lend an eare vnto my petition, and remember thy promise in Christ, thy beloued, that thou wilt lay no more vpon thine, then they shall be able to beare. Lord, thou knowest my weakenesse, to beare this heauy burden of pouertie, and disgrace among the sonnes of men: & therefore, let it please thee to make it more light: or giue me sufficient strength, and then lay what thou wilt vpon me more: onely, Lord, be mindfull of me, who knowest, what I neede before I aske. And therefore, giue me grace to auoyde that presumption, which offereth to limite thee, the holy one of Israel, either in the time, the manner, or matter of my helpe: I will rest me only vpon thy prouidence and mercy; make hast to helpe, O Lord, my God, my strength, and my Redeemer.

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer to be said of such as are in prison.
               
               
                  AS libertie is a great blessing of God, and much pleasing vnto all creatures, reasonable and vnreasonable: So is imprisonment and restraint most vnsauorie to man and beast. Although some men rather make choice to liue in that kind of captiuitie, then to tedeeme their freedom, by discharging a sound & sincere conscience, by paying their debts, being able, or yeelding vnto some honest & lawful condition: for refusing whereof they indure, wilfully vndergoing that, which with more sincerity they might auoid, which kind of voluntarie imprisonment, implyeth a most vnchristian disposition▪ For how can he that knoweth he doth ill, and perseuereth therein, thinke that the prayers which he maketh, can be acceptable to God? admit, his resolutiō be grounded on will, not to giue way to his aduersaries iust demaund,

it is erronious and dangerous: yea, though it arise in regard of a fatherly care and affection he hath to his children and posteritie. If hee shew not himselfe willing to make satisfaction, according to his abilitie; If then the Creditor obdurate, wil not accept his honest offer, his helpe is then in God, to whom he must repaire in faithfull prayer, that he will be pleased, either to moderate the extremitie of the Creditors demand, or, to inable him to satisfie the debt. But as mens occasions of dealing, and their mutuall commerce, are many and diuers: so are there diuers causes of mens restraint, and imprisonment: and all are, or ought to be lawfull and iust. The lawful restraint ought to be the more grieuous, because it is alwayes for breach of the law, the vniust festraint, needs not much presse the conscience, for that he is innocent of the accusation, or crime suggested: for it is farre better to be falsly, then truely accused. But, for asmuch as there are diuers occasions of this affliction, it behoueth euery man thus restrained, to consider with himselfe, that whether it be iustly or vniustly layd vpon

him, it is not yet by chance: for God obserueth in vs, what we our selues conceiue not of our selues, and punisheth sinne after a diuers manner. And therefore, though a man say, he hath this 
                     •
                  nflicted vpon him, vpon an vniust complaint, or for a cause surmised, and vntrue: yet doth God bring it so to passe, by such instruments, as are fitte in his prouidence, to be (though against their wils) the Phisitians of his children: for among many medicines, that God vseth to cure our spirituall lepro

                  , this Imprisonment (be it, in respect of the purpose of the instrument, right or wrong) is one of the principall, and the more auaileable, by howmuch it is capitall: for when a man is bodily fettered, and gyued, that he cannot walke at his former desired libertie, and is in feare of the censure of the law, then is the minde set at large, not restrained as before, with the d

                        •
                      according to the occasion here set down.
                  GRacious Lord God, the most iust, & most wise, thou disposest all things for all men, according to thine own will, in mercy and iudgement: In both which, the wisest caruall man is most ignorant, censuring thy waies according to his weake vnderstanding, taking, and imagining, thy fauour and loue towards men, to consist it thy plentifully furnishing them, with the fulnes of worldly & carnal comforts; & thy hatred, & anger to appeare, by leauing them naked of corporall consolation: & imprisonment,

to be the highest argument of thy heauiest displeasure. But thou, Lord, knowest thine owne ends, in restrayning men of their libertie: wherin they haue scope to run into all forbidden & vngodly actions, delighting themselues in vanities, in wantonnes, & sinful security: and therfore thou restrainest thē whom thou louest, lest their liberty should so admit carnall delights, as thy feare being farre off, there should be neither time, place, or occasion to call vpon thee: but thy Iudgements are secret, & therfore mistakē of the seeming wisest men of the world, who looke not wherunto their own liberty tendeth, as to occasion them to run into forbidden lustes, & consequently into a reprobate sence: wherein yet they dreame of highest happinesse. And thy mercies are also misconceiued of such as want the light of thy sauing truth, as all men doe by nature, who thinke euery affliction or crosse bitter, and vnpleasant: but imprisonment the sharpest tryal that can befall them. Flesh and blood, Lord, cannot conceiue, but as thou hast made all thy creatures, at their beginnings free:

So should man, thy most excellent creature, be euer free, and liue at libertie: But thou knowest man, better then man knoweth himself; and seest and considerest, whether libertie or imprisonment is most profitable vnto him: and forasmuch as I am of the number of them whom thou pleasest to trie with this kind of affliction, and of the number also of such as are by nature ignorant, whether this thy tryall be in mercy and iudgement: Teach me, Lord, the right rule of diuine knowledge, that I may truly find this thy correction to bee in mercy; that thou hast found me out in mine offending course of life, and that my liberty, rather tended to thy dishonour, and mine owne danger, then to the true seruice of thee, and mine owne true comfort. And therefore, assist me with thy sweet, and truly comforting grace, that I may make a godly vse of my restraint: namely, Lord, to abandon all the remembrance of former carnall delights, vulesse to repent them, and wholy, and altogether to dedicate my selfe, to the meditation

of diuine and heauenly things, to earnest, zealous, and faithfull continuall prayer for the increase of thy mercies towards me, and mine obedience towards thee: And that it may please thee, Lord, so to season this thy medicine of Imprisonment vnto me, with the gift of true patience, that it may make mēe to abhorre, from hence forth, the vanities, wherein. I delighted, in my libertie: that if thy pleasure bee to restore me to my former freedome, I may liue, as if I were still really restrained. Thou, Lord, knowest the harts of those, by whose means, in thy prouidence I suffer this restraint, and the cause on my part.

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer, that wee may be alwayes readie to die, and to be so prepared, as wee may not feare death.
               
               
                  THough it had neuer bin writtē that it is appointed by God, that all men must once die: yet common experience, and the continuall practise of death, could not but assure all men, that they must die. If any man had bin priuiledged from the power of death since the creation, men might haue beene perswaded, that they might haue the like immunitie and freedome. But seeing death hath not spared the strong, the wise, the rich, nor the persons of mightiest potentates; but all the godly and the wicked haue tasted of the cup of death: What man is he that is so so
                     ••
                  ed, as to thinke he shall not die? Nay, to thinke, that by reason of the strength of his bodie, he shall liue many yeares? Yet so foolishly perswaded are many men, and assume vnto themselues

a kinde of desperate boldnes, to commit many grosse and grieuous sinnes, promising vnto themselues a time of repentance in their decrepite age. A preposterous rule of godlesse men: who, though they know, that as sure as they liue, they shall die; and as sure as they liue, and shall die, so surely they shall liue or die eternally, yet, being deluded by the opinion of their strength, and health, and bewitched by their vaine, idle, and forbidden lusts of the flesh, and the minde, they delay their preparation to die wel, vntill the time they haue no power to reforme their wicked liues past: So that their present liuely carnall life, is a begun spirituall death: And the time of their foolishly prefixed repentance, is the beginning of their endlesse condemnation. But the truely wise indeed, guided by grace, haue the time of their dissolution continually before their eyes, and in a holy meditation of death, prepare themselues to die daily, thinking euery day they rise, that that is the day of their dissolution: and when they betake them to their nightly rest, they recommend them to their beds, as to their

graues, and perswade themselues, that that night may be the day-spring of their spirituall and neuer ending life. Such as thus prepare themselues, haue neuer any feare to die; but in their hearts wish to be dissolued, and to be with Christ And because that this holy preparation is not wrought, neither can a man desire, to leaue, and remoue out of this earthly tabernacle by nature, they cannot but naturally feare to die. And therefore, when the messengers of death begin to summon men, vnprepared to their graues, they cannot but entertaine horror, in stead of hope, and despaire, in stead of assurance of the life to come. How much then doth it concerne all men to abandon sinne betimes, and to seek attonement with God by well doing, to walke before God, and to be vpright? Thus whosoeuer prepareth himselfe in a sanctified life in earth, he cannot feare death, which is an entrance into a glorious life in heauen; where God, before whom he sincerely walketh, hath prouided him a Citie, a Kingdome, a Crowne. He then, that longeth to see good dayes while he liueth, will be euer studious to please

him, by whom he is assured he shall receiue that endlesse inheritance when he dies. Let euery man therefore, while it is to day, pray, that God will vouchsafe him his grace, not to prolong his godly preparation to die, but to teach him wisdome in the inner parts, that he may so rectifie his conuersation, as he may be acceptable to God, through Christ, in his life vpon earth, and wishedly surrender vp his spirit to him that gaue it, when he requires the same. And to this holy purpose serueth this prayer following.
               
                  Remember euer that thou must die, and thou shalt neuer doe amisse, nor die eternally.
               
               
                  A Prayer to be often vsed, that we may so liue, as we neuer need feare to die; fit to be often vsed of all men, especially in sicknesse.

As for mee, thou hast taught mee to know thy more then wonderfull work-manship, and thy more then apprehensible fauour and loue, in that thou hast not only made me a liuing creature, as are the beasts of the field, the fowles of the aite, and creeping things of the earth, but little inferiour to thine heauenly Angels, giuing me a soule diuine and immortal, which liueth eternally. And of thy further and more free grace, hast vouchsafed me a seed of the light of diuine vnderstanding, and thy word of glad tidings, to teach me thy will, to direct and encourage me in the way of saluation: lest hauing receiued the testimonie of thy lou

respect of him that shed his dearest bloud for them: but most deare vnto vs wretches, if for our mindes vanities, and our bodies pleasures, we should lose our bodies, & make shipwracke of our soules. Precious in thy sight is the death of thy Saints; but most feareful to the wicked in the death of their bodies, that sleeping in the graue, send their soules before them, to be mutually tormented, when they shall meet in Judgement. This fearefull separation, Lord, amazeth mee, when I consider it in my naturall vnderstanding, not looking into the course of thy loue, wherein thou didst send thy dearest Soune to die for sinners penitent. Oh teach me thy waies, instruct me in thy Commandements. Giue me a repenting heart, and sanctified conuersation, that before I goe hence, and be no more seene, I may assure my selfe that I am of the number of them, to whome thou imputest no sinne. Let thy word worke fruitfully in mee, the sauour of life vnto life. Teach me and guide me in the true course of holy obedience, in righteousnesse

and true holinesse, that I may euer walke before thee, and be vpright: giue me a prepared heart, constantly and faithfully to desire to be dissolued, & to be with Christ. Take away the frailty of my fainting flesh, increase and confirme my faith in thee, and my hope of the glory promised in Christ after this mortall life. Let me alwayes wait the time of my deliuery, and be willingly content to, lay downe this my earthly tabernacle, and to giue vp my soule into thy hands: giue me a continuall watchfull heart, that death come not vpon me vnawares: a prepared heart, that I may be still readie, when or where, or how thou hast determined my dissolution. Let nothing be so deare vnto me, as Christ my Sauiour. Let me esteeme all things as dung, in respect of the glorie to come. Let nothing bewitch or intice me to the loue of this sinfull life, nor dismay or terrifie me frō embracing death: But that I may vse this life, as if I vsed it not, and feare death, as if I feared it not: That when my life shall be swallowed vp of death. I

may then enter into that new life, and treade downe death and the power thereof vnder my feete, by Christ, that triumphed ouer Satan, death and Hell, vpon the Crosse for me: grant it for me, my Lord, my God, my life, my light, my strength, and my Redeemer.

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer to bee said of one in his sicknes, or in any disease, or defect of his sences or limbes, fit to be read of, or vnto the sick and diseased person.
               
               
                  SIcknes of the bodie is the gentlest and most fauourable crosse that God layeth vpō his children, and yet it is grieuous to flesh and bloud, which delite altogether in Ease, in Health, in Strength of the body,

to which griefe, sicknesse and weaknesse are contraries, and therefore vnwelcome to carnall men, who thinke nothing more to bee wished, then power to sinne, which power is diminished by sicknes, and consequently in most salutarie, and healthful for the soule. And therefore doth the Wise-man counsell vs to humble our selues before we be sicke, and while wee yet haue power to sinne, to shew our conuersion▪
                   whose counsell, whoso truly and carefully followeth, preuenteth the feare of death: for he that (before sicknes seaze vpon him) duely considereth that death is the end of all flesh, and that sicknesse is the fore-runner of death, cannot bee suddenly surprised, because he stil expecteth the comming of that, which, whether it tarrie long, or come quickly, come it will, and finding vs secure, and wanton, and carelesse, and deliting our selues in the strength of our sinning parts, it wil be so much the more grieuous and irkesome, by how much we affect the strength to sinne, which is thereby weakened. And to that end doth God euen in loue punish his own children with sicknes and maladies of the bodie,

to kill sinne presently possessing vs, and to preuent the power of future sinning, and threatneth the stifnecked and rebellious, with many infirmities, as to smite them in the knees, and in the thighes, with a fore botch, that they shall not be healed, euen from the sole of the 
                        ••
                     ore, to the top of their head. The Lord will make the plagues of the disobedient wonderfull, and of long continuance, and their diseases cruell, and of long durance. For as much then, as Sicknesse is both the reward of sinne, as also the physicke for sinne: It implieth both the mercie of God towards his, and his iudgements against the impenitent. And therefore whosoeuer thou be, that art visited, with whatsoeuer bodily disease or infirmitie; think that God hath sent it, as a cure or a curse. A cure to them that enter into the examination of their sinnes, and truely repent them: and a curse vnto them that make no vse of it; as too many worldlings doe, who in their sicknesse are as inclinable in desire to sinne, as in their health: And nothing preuenreth the acte of sinne, but weaknes to effect it, or oportunitie to attempt it. If therfore the will to do euill, be not

mortified by the sicknes of the bodie, it is an argument, that, that man or woman hath his or her conscience seared vp, which is a fearefull estate, and full of horror, howsoeuer it be for the time hidden, euen from his, or her feeling and sence; in fine it will work in the accusing conscience, and bring forth the fruit of despaire of recouery of bodily health, and plunge the soule into the pit of ineuitable perdition. It is therefore a most dangerous negligence in men, so little to consider the inconstancy of corporal health, which is long in decaying, yet sodaine in surprising men of greatest strength▪ and when men are taken and cast downe, be he as strong as Samson, he is inforced to yeeld vnto weaknes, and if he haue any sparke of grace, he will then indeuour to turne his heart vnto God, as Hezekiah did: but then cannot his petitions be so powerfull, as when he enioyed his health, neither can his repentance be so well manifested, being, as it were, wrested from him, by this kinde of extremitie, as when it is wrought in bodily strength: for whatsoeuer commeth by compulsion, is not so acceptable, as what is voluntarie,

yet is repentance truely begun in sicknesse, and effectually continued, though weakly, in respect of the bodies infirmity; yet may it be most true, through the strength of faith, without repentance there is no cure comfortable to the soule or bodie. Though God may permit a wicked man to be cased or cured of his bodily disease by humane physicke; yet the soule lieth still in almost deadly sicknesse. The truest ground of preuailing physicke, is to make peace first with God, the good and great Physitian: according to the counsell of the Wiseman, who thus aduiseth: My sonne, faile not in thy sicknesse to pray vnto the Lord, and hee will make thee whole: yet he addeth a condition, That he leaue off from sinne, that he order his hands aright, and that he clense his heart from all wickednesse: and if hw be able truely to say, as Hezekiah in his sicknes did, I beseech thee, Lord, remember now, how I haue walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and haue done that which is good in thy sight: Then he may bee assured, that his sicknesse shall be turned from a curse to a blessing; and God that hath made the wound, will binde it vp and cure it, he

will raise him againe, or giue him patience, in a liuely hope to change this mortall for an immortall estate: and for his patient suffering this medicinable crosse, will giue him a glorious crowne of eternitie. Whosoeuer therfore thou be that art visited, turne vnto the Lord, pray vnto him, trust in him, and recommend thy life & death vnto his free disposition, who worketh all things for the best to them that loue him.

The health of my bodie is a sweet blessing vnto me, yet thou knowest, Lord, what a spurre it is to forbidden vanities. And sicknes, as it is in it selfe, is most grieuous and lothsome; yet being seasoned with thy inward grace, a sweet remedie against the killing disease of sinne. Oh show it downe, Lord, into my distressed soule, the sweet showres of thy sanctifying Spirit, that I may hee sanctified throughout: so shall my sicke and weake bodie bee richly and sweetly comforted in this comfortlesse

condition, which, were it not supported by thy fauour & loue, could not but faint, & al the powers, both of my soule & bodie faile within me. Oh speak cōfortable things, Lord, vnto thy diseased seruant, extend a fatherly helping hand to make my bed in my sicknes: Thou art the Physitian of our soules & bodies; I am sicke in both, cure me, Lord, in both; my sicke soule hath need of the bloud of the Lambe to refresh it, and to clense it from spirituall leprosse: and my body, Lord, lieth at the foot-stoole of thy mercy; and as thou by thy word didst make me in the beginning, so by thy word canst thou reuiue me, that am neere both spiritually & corporally dead. If thou in thy wisedome thinke, yt this my infirmity be more profitable vnto me, then health, or death more cōuenient for me thē life, performe thine owne good pleasure towards me; only make me inwardly and outwardly ready, that I setting both the houses of my soule and bodie in order through Christ, I may recommend both into thy most sacred and sauing disposition.

Grant this, Oh Father, for Iesus Christ thy beare Sonnes sake, who liueth and raigneth with thee in the heauens, with whome, and in whom, grant, Lord, that I may liue, and after this life, raigne for euermore.

Thou Lord, are full of compassion and mercie, slow to anger, and of great goodnesse: thou wilt not alway childe, neither keepest thou thine anger for euer.

                  st, that we sorrow not, as doe the Heathen, that haue no hope of a future better life. Secondly, wee must beware wee

                   for his sonne: And as did Ahaziah in his owne sicknesse: we must rather enter into an holy consideration, that God, in whatsoeuer he layeth vpon our selues, or vpon them we loue as our selues, it is for his owne glory, and therefore to be praised of vs, both for ours, & the good of those our friends, whom he afflicteth; if we beleeue his promises, that all things shall worke together for the good of them that loue him. The best office then, and the most Christian duety that a Father can performe for, and in the behalfe of his sicke childe, or one deare friend, or brother for another, is first to admonish him, that sinnes cause sicknesse, and to moue him to repent them; that euery man is borne to die, and therefore to perswade him to prepare himselfe for another condition: not to flatter him, as too many doe, as that they seen
                        •
                      cause why he should feare death at this time: they seeme rather to assure him he shal recouer and liue with them: which kinde of comfort, is rather iniurious then friendly: for what if the partie thus idlely secured, perish

without repentance? These kindes of comforters haue little cause to imagine, they haue performed a Christian dutie, in this their visitation of their sick friend, whom they seemed to loue much, bewailing his sicknes, and yet content to send him away with the heauie burden of his sinnes. A second Christian duty is to pray for the sicke, either in priuate, or in publike assemblies of, and with such as are present with the sick person, wherein also the sicke person may conioyne either in the whole prayer, by an inward lifting vp of his repenting and faithful heart to God, in a holy meditation of what they pray; or to conclude with them all, Amen. The prayer of the faithfull auaileth much, if it be feruent. The Lord by this meanes, will strengthen him vpon his bed, raise him to health, or translate him in his good time. To visite the sicke, is an action most acceptable to God. Yee haue visited me (saith Christ) when I was sicke, therefore c

So that we doe acknowledge, that thou visitest this thy seruant, here at this present languishing, and that the present infirmity, wherewith he is afflicted, is of theesent, to humble him for his sinnes. Let it please thee, O Lord, to behold him in mercy: and lay not vpon him too great a weight of thy dispeasure, knowing, that man in his greatest strength, is weake: how much more feeble, being crushed, as it were in

through the assurance, that his sins are freely forgiuen him, that hee may take this thy visitation as a fatherly correction, and louing chastisement for his former offences: And that, if thou be pleased to restore him to health, it may worke in him a true renouation, & reformation of the rest of his life: heare, haue mercy vpon him, O Lord, haue mercy vpon him: and according to the multitude of thy mercies, doe away all his offences. Looke fauourably vpon him, cure him, if it please thee, restore him to health, if it may stand with thy glory, and his good.

It is not rare to heare of one breaking his legge, another his arme, a third bruzing his body, a fourth comming to vntimely death, by falling off, or from his horse: nay, the slip of the foote hath many wayes occasioned death, besides hazard of

It is a sweet contentment to a faithfull man, to rest assured of Gods presence in all his wayes, and of the ayde of his holy Angels, whom he sendeth ministring spirits, for the good of his: nothing can hurt them, of whom God hath taken charge, neither can any thing but prosper, which he blesseth vnto vs. And therefore, he that wilfully omitteth this holy dutie of seruing the liuing God, cannot

assure him of any good successe of whatsoeuer he attempteth.

                  A MOTIVE TO Prayer to be said after the returne from a Iourney, or comming to the Inne or place of rest.
               
                  ALl men in their Iourneyes wish for good successe, but not according to true zeale, and that is the reason, when they returne safe, they doe not giue the glory to God, they asked not his presence to be with them, and therefore giue they the glory to their owne abilities to trauaile, to the goodnesse of the horse, and to the good companie they had. If euill happen vnto them, or hurt befall them, they lay it vpon the creature, or vpon some suddaine accident, neither giuing thanks to God, by whose prouidence indeed they returned, or came safe to their place of rest, nor their crosses to proceed of their sinnes and neglect of the seruice of God. If euery man would truely, and without partiality, enter into the examination of his

owne heart, how many would finde in themselues a true desire to haue the
                     •
                   iourneyes or enterprises blessed 
                     〈◊〉
                   God, by their zealous prayers made vnto him, before they attempt them▪ And how many would there be found so thankefull, as to prayse God seriously, when they returne or come to their place of rest in safetie? It is the last worke in euery action: And therfore God, although he permit forgetfull men, to succeed wishedly in their affaires, yet retaineth hee their vnthankefulnesse in memorie, and often turneth their glory to shame, their ioy into sorrow, and the things, wherunto they ascribe their greatest preseruation, into their suddaine destruction. It is a matter too common, to receiue good at the hands of God, and to reward him euilly: as doe all men that begin their trauailes without him, and seeke not his fauour and direction in their occasions; which maketh many to forget their religious thankefulnesse, and to be

                  deed) it behooueth them that professe

a diuine prouidence, to seeke safety, preseruation and direction at the hands of God: and hauing receiued the successe, be it according, or against their desires, they may assure themselues it falleth out for the best, because God doth all for the good of true beleeuers, whatsoeuer is done; and therefore requireth thankefulnesse in the conclusion of euery Iourney, action or enterprise: for true thankefulnesse for a benefite receiued, standeth in place of a preuailing petition for and obtaining a newe blessing.

                  MOst gracious and louing Lord God, I giue thee most humble & vnfained thanks, that thou so mercifully hast blessed me this day in my Journey and trauailes, preseruing me frō many perils that I haue escaped, euen by thine owne power and prouidence,

and hast in safety brought me vnto this place of rest, which yet, without thy blessing, may becom a place of trouble: for as the fields and wayes are full of hidden dangers, which without thy protection could not but haue faln vpō me: so is not this place, whereinto I am safely retired, by thy prouidence, free from perils: and therefore, as thou hast hitherunto kept me, keepe me now in this place, wherein, if thou dwel not by thy power and louing fauor, there cannot but abide, Sathan, sinne, and vanities, powerfull enemies, and able to surprise the strongest naturall man.

succeed vnto me: depart not from me, good Father, but blesse me first, that I may be euer blessed; So shall all things goe well with me, both going foorth, and comming in, and all things worke together, for my continuall consolation: wherefore giue me grace euer to loue thee in Christ mine euerlasting Redeemer,

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer, to be said before a Sermon.
               
               
                  MAn by nature being a sincke of corruption, and a gulfe of hidden hypocrisie, & his conscience naturally oppressed with a slauish feare, lest his inward and secret euill thoughts should be reueiled, and his hidden iniquities discouered, as much as in him lyeth, coueteth to shun the light of the word of God, which comprehendeth both the killing Law, and the sauing glad tidings of the Gospel:
                  
by the one he is condemned, and therefore hateth the sentence which pronounceth, that whosoeuer sinneth, shall die: yet apprehendeth he not, either the grieuousnesse of his sinnes, nor the miserie of the Gospel, which is the preaching of repentance, and the forgiuenesse of sinnes; but lying securely in his sinnes, thinketh not of any account, and therfore regardeth not much the word preached, But whē shame or authoritie presseth the carnall man to heare the word, he th
                     ••
                   heareth sinne reproued, and the sinfull condemned: which is so v

                        ••
                     , reprouing him for his brothers wife: be it the Law, or the Gospel, that such men heare, it is as harsh vnto them, as the words of Michaiah to Ahab▪
                   yet we must vnderstand, that though ma
                     •
                   deliuer the word, it is not his, but the word of God: and therefore, no man, but such a one as is yet in the state of reprobation, wil refuse to he are, God who is mercifull and louing, speake vnto him; if it be but the threatning Law, which teacheth what is sinne▪
                  
and what is the reward of sinne, wherby being cast downe with sorrow that he hath committed things so contrary to the will of his Creator, he may seeke atonement, and reconciliation with his offended God, by the Gospel, the testimonie of his loue: Are not my words (saith God) good, vnto him that walkes vprightly? Therefore none but the obstinately wicked, will shun the word preached, which aswell offereth remission of sinnes committed, as it threatneth death to the impenitent. The Scriptures in many places command vs to seeke the Lord, which argueth that we by nature are strangers from God, separated by sinne, and to remaine so, is the most miserable condition that can befall the sonnes of men. And where is the Lord to be sought, but in his word, which is the life of the soule? As the soule & body are knit together, and conserued by breath: So are our soules connexed and conioyned vnto God, by the word of truth preached by Gods minister, apprehended by faith, and practised in spirit and truth. The naturall man couets and delights to refresh himselfe in his griefes and

crosses, by musicke, by merry company, and by reading prophane bookes, or hearing pleasant conceited songs or comedies; which doe not onely not comfort, but rather increase their griefes. Contrarily Dauid protested, that hee sought and found the onely true comfort in the word of God. So doe all that are truely qualified in the rules of right religion, though worldlings account it a melancholike wearinesse, to sit an hou
                     •
                  e to heare God speake vnto them. But let them thinke, that this wearinesse shall be a witnesse against them that they belong not to the Lord. Euery man desires to see his image in a glasse, for two ends, the one to see his feature, the other to correct his deformities. And Saint Iames compares the word of God to a glasse, wherein are two sorts of Images discouered, namely of Nature and Grace: The first, sheweth what we our selues are: the second, what we ought to seeke to be: namely, to be like vnto our head, Christ Iesus, in all sanctitie and holinesse, in suffering patiently, and obeying God truely. This is by no other meanes learned, but by the word of God preiched.

But some, that haue made the least progresse in the loue to godlinesse of life, thinke it sufficient, to read the word of God, or the workes of good and godly men, at home, an exercise not to bee, in it selfe, condemned, but in respect of it, to neglect the word preached, is the contempt of Gods ordinance, who hath in greatest fauour instituted his ministers, to teach by the powerfull preaching of the word: which worketh a more deepe impression in the heart of the hearer, then of the reader. For if wee consider the authoritie of the word preached, it is from God, the ministery from the mouth of man, who is the mouth of God: he therefore that neglects or contemnes the word preached, neglectes the meanes of his saluation, which is faith in Christ Iesus: For faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God preached.
               It is not yet sufficient to heare the word, but as Marie laid vp the word in her heart, so must euery profitable hearer retaine the word in their mindes, permit it to rule in their affections, and to bring foorth the

fruits thereof in their actions, reioycing when they doe the commandements of God; and grieuing, when they transgresse the same. And because there be many things that hinder the growing of this sauing seede, and many grounds receiue it: but onely one, namely, good ground can bring forth the fruit: It behooueth to pray, that our hearts may be made fit to heare, our affections fit to loue; and our whole man apt to cherish this seede, by continuall holy practise.
               Lord increase my faith.
               
                  A Prayer to be said, before the hearing of a Sermon.
                  THou, Lord, hast commanded vs, or rather louingly inuited vs to seeke thy face; and yet thou art in the highest heauens among thine Angels, Seraphims, and Cherubims: and wee dust and ashes, are in the earth, full of infirmities, not able to looke vnto, much lesse into the heauens to behold thee there, no the very Angels hide their

faces at the glory of thy great Maiestie. And as for man clothed with mortality, thou affirmest, cannot see thy face and liue. And yet thou sayest, Seeke my face. Lord, what is it to seeke thy face, but to seeke thy truth, and to search thy word, to couet to know thy will, and to bee truely instructed, and faithfully and sincerely inclined to keepe thy commaundements? Thy word is a light vnto our pathes, and a lanthorne vnto our feet. It is the life of our soules, the heauenly Manna, without it, there is no light, no hope, no spirituall comfort, no assurance of saluation. O how deare ought this word then be vnto vs? Farre more sweet then the hony, or the hony combe, more precious then golde, yea, then the finest gold: therein, Lord, see wee thy face, therein beholde wee thy louing countenance, there finde we the hidde pearle, which, to purchase, the wisest will sell all worldly vanities: yet is it to the foolish foolishnesse, and a stumbling blocke vnto the carnally minded.

Jt is a mysterie, Lord, and a secret hidden from the wise of the world, and reuealed onely vnto the humble, to such as acknowledge themselues ignorant, and hunger and thirst for the knowledge of the truth. Such hast thou promised to teach, and to instruct in the way of true wisedome, by reuealing thy word, which howsoeuer it seeme in the outward letter easie to be vnderstood, it hath a spirituall and diuine sense, which requireth a spirituall and diuine interpretation, which commeth not, neither can it be apprehended by nature. And therefore, in thy great mercy and loue thou hast ordained meanes, whereby they whom thou hast appointed to saluation, may bee made able to vnderstand the same: namely, the outward ministrie of men, and the iuward elumination of thy holy spirit: for without the second, the first auayleth nothing, neither in the minister that speaketh, nor they to whom he speaketh: vnlesse hee be sent of thee, and the hearers eares opened, and their hearts prepared

by thee, hee preacheth, and they heare in vaine. To the one a woe is pronounced, as not preaching the Gospel sincerely, to the other a curse, for not receiuing the good word of truth, as into good and fruitfull ground, bringing foorth the liuely fruits of a life answerable to that word, which is either the sauour of life vnto life, or the sauor of death vnto death. O Lord, I am now come into thy, presence, to heare thee speake vnto vs here assembled, by the mouth of thy seruant, whom thou hast sent to preach thy word: open therefore mine eares, prepare my heart, sanctifie mine Attention, inlighten mine Vnderstanding, strengthen my memorie, rectifie my will, that I may diligently heare, attentiuely harken, retentiuely remember, and willingly imbrace and practice, what shall bee truely and sincerely deliuered by thy minister. And let not thy word, Lord, that shall fall from his mouth, bee either choaked in mee with the thorny cares of the world, nor be cast into so corrupt a heart, as the vaine delights of

my minde should deuoure it, nor into so

                     •
                   no more can the soule of man liue without Spirituall food, the

word of God. And as man by art helpeth nature to concoct and digest his food; to make it nutratiue to his body: So the spiritual man hauing heard the sauing word of God, vseth the means to make it profitable to the soule: for as natural food takē into the mouth, and instantly spet out againe, though it be a while detained and chawed, and not taken into the bodie, relieueth not the body: So the Word heard with the care, and not conueyed into, and retained in the heart, yeeldeth no comfort vnto the soule; but rather worketh a kinde of contempt by custome, and a kinde of lothing of the Word, as a matter, without the which his soule may liue: for as that meate, wherein the pallet hath no feeling of a pleasing taste, delighteth not the appeti
                     ••
                  : no more can that Word, which is not sauourie and delightfull to the soule, be pleasing, or profitable to the outward eare, and consequently nothing comfortable to the vnfeeling soule. But it is not in the power of man by nature, profitably, or with comfort to heare, much lesse to make true vse of the word of God. It is the gift of God to open the eare, which is

common to the good and bad hearers; but a worke of the holy Ghost, to open and prepare the heart to receiue the Word, and to bring forth the fruit thereof, without the which, it is not only not an idle sound, but a killing letter: for it neuer falleth into the ears of any, but it is either the sauour of life, vnto life, by the operation of faith and repentance, or the sauour of death, vnto death, by the hardnes of the impenetrable and impenitent heart. Therfore it much behoueth Christians, not only to be carefull to heare, but to be diligent and considerate how they heare, to lay it vp in their hearts, to make vse of it vpon all occasions, in prosperity and aduersitie, in sicknes, and health, and in what estate soeuer he is: for it is as a treasure, to purchase in euery calamitie, comfort, through patience, and in all consolation, inward or outward, liuely and true thankfulnes. Whatsoeuer or whosoeuer therefore thou be, that hast at any time tasted of the good word of God, forget not, that although it be pronounced by man, it is the word of the most Highest, who will take an account of thee, how, and what thou hast

heard: and if thou fold it vp in the napking of forgetfulnes, and put it not forth to the vse of thy soule, it shall be taken from thee, euen that thou hast, and thou cast out of his presence, whose word and counsaile thou hast so neglected. Be not therefore forgetfull to ruminate, and as it were, often to 
                     •
                  hew the cud of that word thou hearest, as at the mouth of God: and because we are naturally al flow to heare what we should heare, and our mindes very hard to retaine the good things proceeding out of the mouth of God; we are to pray, and humbly to petition the Lord of life, to turne the word heard, to the sauour of life, vnto our eternally life, it ought to be our continuall studie; yea, aboue al our worldly cares and occasions, to meditate of the word we haue heard, that it slippe not out of our mindes; it is a Iewell which we shall hardly keepe, vnlesse we lay it vp in our hearts, for the enemie goeth about to steale it out of our hearts, by many carnall delights and vanities: It is the seed sowne, to bring forth good fruit, we must beware that we admit no tares, cockle, or darn

                  l to grow vp therewith, sinne and iniquity:

let it fructifie in goodnesse, and pray that the grace of God, watering our hearts, may keepe downe the weeds of sinne, and fructifie the good fruits of righteousnes, to make vs holy, and of vpright conuersation before God and men. God hath made a promise to the faithfully praying, to send his holy Spirit to helpe our infirmities. And to this end vse this Prayer following, or some to the like purpose, whensoeuer thou hearest the Word preached, it shall much confirme thee in a godly desire to heare and practise; and thou thereby shalt finde comfort in all thy wayes.
               
                  A Prayer to be said after the hearing of a Sermon.
                  MOst bountifull, and most louing Lord God, the giuer of all good things, feeder, releeuer, & preseruer of our soules and bodies: I yeeld thee most humble and most hartie thankes, for that thou at this time hast so louingly and Fatherly reuealed vnto vs thy will, out of thy word, and ha

                      made our fainting soules partakers

of that celestiall and blessed Manna, thy sauing word. Good Father, as thou hast plentifully now fed vs with the milke of thy sacred word, giue it, Lord, a relieuing and nourishing power, to refresh and strengthen our soules, to walke before thee, in liuely and acceptable obedience, and a sanctified conuersation. Grant that the word now sowne in our eares, may take deepe roote in our hearts, and bring forth fruit manifold: Let not the enuious man preuaile in casting in amongst thy good seed, the cockle, tares, and weeds of sinne and iniquitie, to the peruerting or preuenting of our new obedience. Let not the thorny cares of this world trouble and choake, nor the vanities of our corrupt mindes vinder the growth of this sauing seed in our hearts. Let not ye scorching Sun of ouer heaui
                        •
                      afflictions cause this fruit of saluation to wither: but water it, Lord, with the continuall dew of thy holy Spirit; & as our vnfruitful and harren harts shall grow weak, wanting this liuely foode, supply it, Lord, from time to time, by

the preaching of thy word: and giue vs diligent eares, and obseruing hearts at all times: and grant that wee bee not hearers only, but doers of thy will. And for that our hearts are hard to conceiue, open our vnderstandings: and for that our memories are short, and vnable to retaine the sauing word, giue vs hearts of continuall holy meditation, that we may be euer chewing the cudde of that heauenly food, and so digest the same, that it may more & more strengthen our faith vnto saluation. And let the words, O Lord, which we haue now and formerly heard, neuer returne in vaine, but worke that holy effect, for which thou hast appointed it, namely, the increase and confirmation of our faith in thee, obedience, repentance, and newnes of life, that we euer more and more hungring and thirsting for this sweete and sauing food, may at length bee made able to liue in all holy and spotlesse conuersation, before thee our heauenly Father, and indeuour with all holy alacritie and ioyfulnes, to take the aduantage of

all oportunities, to heare thee to speake vnto vs, to follow and performe what thou commandest, and to shun, and with carefulnes to auoid what thou forbiddest. Let nothing hinder vs, Lord, from a louing desire to repaire vnto thy house, to refresh our soules with the bread of heauen: and let vs not couet to bee seene of men, onely hearers, but found and allowed of thee, doers of thy will. Grant this, Lord, for thy Christs sake.
                  Amen.
                  Lord increase our faith.
               
            
            
               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer to be said against malicious aduersaries.
               
               
                  FOr as much as the holy Ghost testifieth that our Sauiour Christ Iesus had his enemies, he liuing in all holines, integritie, and innocencie: should we, mortall sinners, corrupt, and many wayes transgressing wretches, thinke much to be hated, maligned,

enuied, and persecuted of men; or doth any man thinke, that if he do as his Master hath commanded, hee shall not finde the same measure, that his Master found, who himselfe did, what he would we should do, and was only enuied for his well-doing? Happie is that man, that procureth enemies by his godly conuersation; for it is certaine, they that hate him for his sinceritie, are not his, but Gods enemies also. But to draw men to hate vs for our vices, their hatred is rather 
                     〈◊〉
                   vertue commendable, then a fault reproueable: for it tendeth not vnto the hurt of our bodies, but the reformation of our liues: and as we shall begin to incline to godlines, so will the hatred of the godly turn into loue. And though Satan then step in, to incoūter vs with his malignant ministers, there is no cause to feare: for thought thousands compasse vs about to deuour vs, there shall be more with vs, then with them, & fiue shal chase an hūdred, and an hūdred put ten thousand to flight; The Lord shall cause thine enemies, that rise against thee, to fall before thy face:

punisheth the enemies of his children by other meanes, then by them to whom they are enemies; as he gaue the enemies of Lot into Abrahams hands: if we obey the Lord, he will persecute them that couet to persecute vs, though we be silent, and desire no reuenge; Vengeance is the Lords, and he will reward. There is no greater reuenge to be offered against an enemie, then to leaue him to Gods reuenge, and to liue in the presence of the enemy so, as he can take no exceptions against our cōuer

                   brethren: Ioseph was condemned for an Adulterer, Daniel for a Rebell, Iob for an Hypocrite, and Christ our Sauiour, for a Malefactor. And how did God worke for these? Ioseph was freed and exalted, Daniel cleared and iustified, Iob restored & approued; though Christ were condemned for vs, he was glorified, and shall glorifie vs. Enemies are most necessarie euils, as a man may terme them: euill in themselues, yet necessarie for vs: we know that an enemie desires to heare, or see, or finde some reprochfull blemish in him, whom he loueth not, and to that end will obserue, and marke our conuersations, and will solicite others to prie into our wayes, to the end he may bring vs into slander. But the man that is wise, as a Serpent, will seeke also to be innocent as a Doue, knowing that he walkes in the light, and his enemies are euer attending on his wayes in couert. It therefore concernes vs much, to consider how we walk before men, much more how we stray before our enemies: and because it is not in our power, to walke

before God or men, & to be vpright, the first and principal thing for which we ought to pray, is, for the grace of God, to liue an vpright life, that our enemie the diuell haue no aduantage against vs. So shall our corporall enemies be inforced to be silent: and hauing clensed and conformed our conuersation to a righteous course, then our prayers to God for deliuerie against our enemies, will be truely auaileable: for then will hee take our cause into his owne hand, and he will be our buckler, sword, and defence, and we shall be safe vnder the shadow of his wings, especially if we seeke according to the rule of Christ, to doe them good, that seeke to doe vs hurt: for it is the part of a true Christian, to seeke atonement euen with his enemies. And as the Wise-man counselleth, If he that hateth thee be hungry, giue him bread; Christ commands the same. So mayest thou ouercome him, and so winne him, that his owne conscience shall moue him to turne his hatred into loue, or else shalt thou heap coales of wrath on his head, and God shall haue respect to thine offering, and accept thy prayers. Vse therefore

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer to be said of euery true Christian, for the Ministers and Preachers of the word of God.
               
               
                  IF men did duely and religiously consider, what a blessing it is to haue the word of God sincerely preached vnto them, they would be more thankfull to God for them, who are as the conduite pipes, to bring and conuey the water of life vnto them, the glad tidings of peace, and reconciliation with God in Christ. Men naturally loue them that giue them corporall food and necessaries, they dearely esteeme and reuerence the Nurses and Eoster-fathers, that yeeld them but things to strengthen and maintaine

their naturall liues: and the Physitians, by whose art and industrie, they perswade themselues to haue receiued health for their bodies. And is it not much to be admired, that men receiuing the nourishment and vitall strēgth of their better part, the soule, should so little regard the meanes, by whom they receiue it? the Ministers of the word of Saluation, the Gospell of Christ? Many will protest they loue Christ, and yet the contrary appeareth, when they not only regard not, but despise his Ministers, whom hee hath sent as Embassadors of his will? We beseech you, brethren (saith Saint Paul to the Thessalonians) that yee haue the Ministers of God in singular loue for their workes sake. We should loue all men, and pray for all men; how much more for them that leade vs to the well of life? The same Saint Paul willeth the Ephesians, not only to pray in an ordinarie maner, but in the Spirit, with perseuerance and watchfulnes, euen for him, that vtterance might be giuen vnto him, and that he might open his mouth boldly, to publish the secret of the Gospell. And are we lesse bound to pray for them that haue the Spirituall charge ouer vs, the care and cure of our soules,

that they may be able to deliuer the Word sincerely, to open their mouths boldly to our edification and consolation in Christ? And that they, namely, the Ministers, may be deliuered from vnreasonable and euill men? for we know that Christ & Antichrist, Truth and Falsehood, Christ and Satan cannot stand together. And he that preacheth the word truely, is the means to bring men out of darknesse to light, from sinne to sanctitie, from Satan to Christ. And therefore Satan will euer oppose himselfe, and instigate euill men to encounter, scandalize, and persecute such as are truest, and most painefull labourers in Gods Spirituall haruest; whereby it commeth to passe, that the word of God is oftentimes hindered, the Church of Christ diminished, Ignorance increased, Religion despised, Vice aduanced, Faith decreased, Obedience to God neglected, and Truth among men meerely abandoned and cōtemned. And al this, where Prophecying & Preaching faile. God giueth not to man a more speciall blessing in earth, then the preaching of the word, which is as the net to catch men: there were three thousand men so catcht at the first preaching of Peter: and by his

continuance in that spirituall fishing, there were caught fiue thousand persons out of the snare of Satan. Let all men, therefore, loue & pray for them that thus fish to saue the soules of mē, that haue the ouersight and rule ouer them: they are the watch men of Christ; and whoso loues Christ the Master and Lord, cannot but loue his Ministers, and pray for them, not only as brethren, but as men appointed by Corist, to direct them the way of saluation. And let no man thinke it is not their duetie to pray for them, because they are appointed and ought to pray for others, and not others for them, as some prophanely affirme. It is a needfull and required duetie, to pray one for another, especially for the Ministers, who are, or ought to be as Gods mouth vnto vs, to teach vs his will; as Gods hand to support vs by spirituall counsell; as Gods eye to obserue our wayes, and as Gods Ministers to reproue vs of sinne, and to pronounce pardon in Christ to the truely penitent. Pray therefore for them, that the gifts of the holy Ghost may abound in them, that men seeing their good workes, may glorifie God, our, & their Father which is in heauē.
               
                  
                  A Prayer to be said for the Ministers of Gods word.
                  GRacious and mercifull, O Lord our God, art thou in all thy wayes and workes towards men, and in nothing more gracious then in thy word preached vnto vs; whereby thou doest open and reueile vnto vs the mystery of our saluation, according to thy good pleasure in Christ our Lord. Thou teachest vs heauenly wisedome in earth, by thy holy Spirit giuen vnto men, whom thou doest set apart to that holy function, as men chosen to winne men to thee. And for as much as neither thy beloued Saints, Peter, nor Iohn, nor Paul, could preach or prophecie before they were sent; neither were they sent, before they were sanctified: Sanctifie and send foorth, Lord, worthy Labourers into thine haruest, and sanctifie and blesse them, whom thou hast sent, with such spirituall gifts and graces, as may enable them to be instant in season and out of season, that they may winue many vnto thee. Inlighten their hearts with the light of true

knowledge: Touch their tongues with the coale from thine Altar, that their lips may preserue knowledge, and in their hearts may bee true zeale, that they may still call vpon thy children to walk in the light of thy truth. And as thou diddest send downe vpon thine Apostles the holy Ghost in fiery tongues to teach thē: so instill into the hearts of all thy Ministers, Preachers of thy word, the fire of true zeale, & a godly boldnes to speake thy truth without respect of persons, not to flatter the wicked, nor to spare the rebuking of sin: and let them comfort the weake harted: let thē be able to bring them that erre, into the right way, that they may conuert & liue, that they may beleeue & liue: for Faith cōmeth by hearing, and hearing by the preaching of thy word. Let therefore the beautiful fruit of thē plentifully appeare amongst vs, yt bring glad tidings of peace wc thē, ye glad tidings of our saluation. And let thē speak nothing, but as thy word teacheth thē, yt they may be foūd good disposers of thy graces. Let their conuersatiōs be vpright before thee: let thē
                     
be as lights set on a hill, that they may teach as well by the example of their owne liues, as by preaching thy Word: that thou in all things mayest be glorified, through Iesus Christ, to whom is praise and dominion, for euer and euer.
                  Amen.
                  Lord increase our faith.
               
            
            
               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer for the Church Uniuersall.
               
               
                  THe Church which S. Paul calleth the House of God, 1. Tim. 3. 15. is the Congregation of the faithfull dispersed throughout the world; and in regard of the vniuersalitie thereof, is called the Church Catholike. Of which Vniuersalitie are many and seuerall societies, distinct by place, vnited by faith. And euery seuerall company professing one and the same truth, confessing one and the same faith, and holding

one and the same forme of administration of the Sacramēts, are one intire bodie, which bodie is the vniuersall Church, wherof Christ is the head: one Spouse, whereof Christ is the husband. He hath begotten this dispersed congregation by vertue of his word, and made them one by the vnity of his Spirit: By which Spirit the Fathers belieued in Christ before the came in the flesh, and were of the same mysticall bodie, whereof we that beleeue his word, being come, are also members, and whereof Christ Iesus hath bin, is, and shall be the euerlasting head. The parable of the Sower, which Christ propounded, Matth. 13. 24. sheweth by the euill seede mixed with the good, that this Church shall neuer be free from offences both in doctrine and manners, vntill the day of the fina
                     〈…〉
                   haruest; whē this holy Congregation, as good corne, shall be gathered into the celestiall garner: and the wicked and vncleane shall be cast off into vtter darknesse. And therefore are the faithfull to arme themselues with patience, and to vndergo with constancie the offences of the contrarily minded: for therfore is the Church of Christ
                  
called a Church Militant, because it is still exercised with enemies, whom we are to resist, and incounter with the weapons of the Spirit. The contrary also are called a Church, but a malignant Church: a Church full of vanitie and prophanenesse, sin, Schismes, Hypocrites and Reprobates: Who also incounter and exercise the Church Militant, with spirituall weapons, the weapons of iniquitie, whose head is Satan, the Red Dragon, the man of sinne, the sonne of perdition, Antichrist. So that Bethel, the house of God, hath continuall warre with Bethauen, the house of the Diuell; Sanctitie with Sin; Truth with Falshood; Light with darknesse; Christ in his members, with Satan and his adherents; heauenly holines, with spirituall wickednes, Ephes. 6. 12. Zechar. 3. 1. 2. The Church of Christ being thus continually assailed, hath only refuge in danger, to her head Christ Iesus, who hath promised, not only to send the Comforter, to teach vs all things, but to defend vs, and to be with vs to the end of the world, Matth. 28. 20. And as he hath thus promised vnto the body, so is he euer with euery member: & where two or three be gathered together in the name of

that one head, he will be there in the midst of them: and therefore it doth not onely behoue euery Christian, to be continually watchfull against these many and malignant aduersaries, spirituall enemies: but to powre foorth cōtinuall supplicatiōs to God the Father in his Son, by the Spirit, not for himself only: but for the whole, & euery part of this Catholike congregatiō, that he will defend vs, aswell from enemies, threatning outward persecution, as working inward tentation. And it much importeth the Church in generall, and euery member of the same, to seeke, and dayly to pray for the reformation of the corruptions cast into the field of the Gospel, by that wicked one, which doth not onely spring vp among, but choaketh, and hindereth the growth of the good seede of sinceritie, by the errors of doctrine, and workes of wickednesse. And therfore doth the heauenly husbandman threaten the extirpation euen of the good seede that hee hath sowen, and to leaue the ground vnto the weeds of sin and vanitie wherunto it is especially inclined: to depriue it altogether of the manurance of

his word, and neuer againe to water it with the dewe of his holy Spirit, lest therefore, that he suffer strangers, Sathan and his ministers to breake downe the hedges of our religious profession, and holy practise of obedience, & the wild beasts of the field (sinnes of all sorts) to roote vp, and deuoure the fruits of our holy conuersations, and lest he should take away, or breake the sta

                  A Prayer for the Uniuersall Church, and for euery member of the same, fit to be often said of euery Christian.
                  ALmighty Lord God, the fountaine of all goodnes, the creator of all men, who in Iesus Christ thy Sonne, hast redeemed them that were captiues, recalled & brought home them that estrayed, receiued and imbraced them again that were run from thee, and saued

them that were lost: Looke now vpon them whom thou hast chosen, and behold in mercy whom thou hast redeemed: and as thou hast in thine owne free mercy, fauour and loue, gathered vnto thy selfe, and set apart for thy seruice, a remnant out of the whole number of mankinde, a peculiar companie, and hast vouchsafed to make them of many, one sanctified body, all by the merits of thy sonne, in whom they are adopted, and made heires of heauen, in whom they liue, moue and haue their spirituall and heauenly being: So, Lord, be thou still their succour, their shield, buckler, and euerlasting defence: thou hast vouchsafed (good Father) to set apart this elected and small company, for thine owne sacred seruice in this mortall life, calling them by the voyce of thy word, sounding through all partes of the vniuersall world, and by the inspiration of that holy comforter, left vnto thy children by promise, hast taught them that wisedome, that is farre about the wisedome of the wisest mortall man, & endowed thē with

that sanctified integritie, that farre exceedeth the sinceritie of the best qualified carnall man, and hast thy selfe promised to continue with them by thy spirit to the end of the world, lest they should, through ouermuch heauinesse and affliction, perish in the way of their pilgrimage: Some thou hast released of their warfare, some, the more to testifie vnto the world, their faith and constant assurance of thine eternall loue and prouidence ouer them, suffrest to fall into the hands of them that could but kill their bodies, their soules being safe in thy protection, and haue in part receiued their reward in heauen, hauing escaped the presentors hands: Some thou hast called by a naturall dissolution, elected, redeemed, sanctified, and in part glorified. And as yet, good Father, there is a small dispersed remnant, which haue not finished their warfare, but are still incountred with Sathan, with sinne, and with their owne corruptions, and still afflicted, persecuted, and distressed: be neere vnto them according to thy word, assist

them by thy grace, enlighten them, teach them, and be euermore their defence: and as successiuely from age to age, the end of dayes, there shall be an increase of people: So let thy Gospel continually propagate, and beget new children vnto thy selfe, and let not the light of thy word decline, but rather shine dayly, more and more cleerely. Let not the power thereof diminish, nor the sound thereof cease, vntill it haue gained and compleated the number of all that shall be saued. Send foorth godly and painefull labourers, that they may be instant in season and out of season, giue them power to bent downe the power of sinne, to stay the violent currant of backessiding, and Apostacie. Send foorth thy word into all lands, let all nations heare it, and al tongues professe it: where thou hast planted it alreadie, water it with the continuall showers of thy grace: where it is not yet sowne, let it fall & fructifie: where it hath bene sowne, and is withered, renew the liuely spring thereof: continue, increase, & beget more & more children vnto

thy selfe through all parts of the world through thy word. And although we bee falne into the last & most declining age, and as it were into the period of time: wherin (as thou hast foreshewed) sinne increaseth, godlinesse diminisheth, holy zeale waxeth weake, loue becomes colde, and counterfeit, and thy sauing word become of none effect among many: yet forget not to bee good vnto thy chosen, leaue not thy Saints vnto the spoyler, rather, shorten these dayes of sinne, lest that the increase of vngodlinesse seduce euen the righteous, and they perish also by straying from the way of life.
                  Lord increase our faith.
               
               
                  Another Prayer for the Uniuersall Church in the time of affliction or persecution.
                  MOst gracious Father, as thou hast shewed thy selfe in former times a most powerfull protector of thy Church, euer since the propagation thereof, and by thy holy spirit hast conserued it

in the vnitie of thy spirit, in a constant & true profession of thy word, in a bolde and sincere confessing of Christ, the head of that sanctified body, euen when persecution vnto death raged and tyrannized most: Bee still mindfull of the same thy little flocke: feede it still with thy word, defend it still with thy mightie hand, guide it euer with thy holy spirit, and euermore preserue it as the vine, which thine own right hand hath planted. Gather together thy sheepe scattered vpon so many mountaines: let not the wolues seaze vpon thy tender lambes, to teare them in peeces while there is none to helpe. Let not the subtill foxes bewitch them with a false religion. Let not the wild Bo

                     e of Antichristian persecution deuoure them: Let not Sathan, nor sinne preuaile against them. But as thou hast promised, let thy Church, and euery member of the same, be as Mount Sion, that shall neuer bee mooued: let them stand fast for euer. Let them florish in all faith and obedience, as trees planted by the riuers, and bring

forth fruits of religion, & true pittie aboundantly: compasse them with armies of thine Angels, as thou diddest compasse Elisha with horses and chariots of fire: and as the mountains compasse Ierusalem: So let thy preuayling power compasse them about: Suffer none, O Lord, to doe them violence: but if in thy wisedome thou thinkest meet to make any member of thy Church, a witnesse of thy trueth, giue him the spirit of true vnderstanding of thy word, faith and constancie to imbrace what measure of affliction or persecution thou shalt thinke fit to lay vpon him for the same: forsake him not, O Lord, in his trials, nor lay no more vpon him, then it may please thee to giue him power to indure. Make thy children, O Lord, strong, and then cannot the threats of the cruellest Tyrants dismay thy outwardly weakest witnesses, from vndergoing the extremest passion of martyrdome. O fortifie all them whom thou hast appointed to any kind of torment, for the testimony of the truth of the Gospel of Iesus Christ. Season them so with the assurance

of their future glory, that they flie not, nor start backe for feare of whatsoeuer torture thine enemies may threaten or execute. The least of which, not being assisted and made easie, by thy all-shining countenance vpon the soule of the persecuted, cannot but dismay him, and dismaying, make him faint, and fainting, make him fall, and so to denie thee. Looke downe therefore, O Lord, vpon, and visite all thine afflicted members, protect them from secret conspiracies, open practises, and violent incursions, plotted by Sathan and Antichrist, and attempted by their bewitched instruments, by whom thy Church and the members thereof and dayly afflicted, and indangered▪ Take thou, wee humbly beseech thee, our defence into thine owne hands: Stop the breach, which the enemie hath made. Maintaine, Lord, thine owne word, protect and keepe thine owne people: conuert, reuert, or confound them that fight against thee, by word or sword, and fight against them that fight against thee in thy members, that thou maiest be glorified, thy Church

God, and Tyrants. The first respecting the lawes of God, and good of his Church, made the lawes of God the paterne of their gouernments. The second, either not knowing God, or knowing him, did not honour him as God, but fell from the liuing God themselues, and caused the people to fall likewise from God to Idols: therby highly incensing God to indignation against them, who grieuously punished them with their Kings. Dauid, Iosiah, Hezekiah, Asa, and Ieboshaphat, were Kings that feared God, 1. King. 15. 12. 2. Chron. 17. 3. These did God aduance to comfort his children, by the free vse of his word, and to defend them from the aduersaries hand, 2. Chron. 1. 11. Contrarily, he setteth vp tyrants, for the punishment of a rebellious people; as Nehemiah complaineth, Nehem. 9. 37. Manasses made the streets of Ierusalem to swim with the blood of his religious subiects. Good, and gracious Princes are as defensiue walles vnto a people, against the rage and violence of enemies, such as of whom Dauid speaketh, Psal. 47. 9. Gebal, and Ammo

Dauid complained in his time, that the kings of the earth did band themselues, and Princes assenibled together against the Lord, and against his people: and hath it not bene seene in our dayes, that mighty potentates haue conspired against Gods anointed, and vs? And that secret trecheries haue bene coyned, to indanger the peace and safety of prince and people? And hath not that God, that deliuered Dauid from Saul, deliuered vs from them that rose vp against vs? And shall we thinke, that the publike and prinate petitions, which the godly haue made for their Soueraignes, hath not much preuailed, to preuent the dangers which haue bene, euen at the point of execution? Let vs therefore neuer forget his goodnesse, but so much the more become instant suppliants vnto that great King of kings, that he will blesse, preserue, protect, and defend his most excellent Maiestic, whose vertues shine to the glory of the kingdome,

his integritie, learning & religious constancie admired: were he a tyrant, we ought to pray for his prosperitie: how much more, being most graciously louing vnto his subiects, ought wee to intercede for him to God, according to the precept of the Apostle, 2. Tim. 1. 2. where he chargeth that all men should pray for kings, who are appointed by God? Let vs therefore pray for his health, wealth, peace, prosperitie and safety: that wee likewise, in and by him, may still, as we now doe, partake of thos

And forget not, Lord, how the wicked still study the meanes to effect that, which thou in mercy diddest then preuent.

suffiseth not for vs, to haue the words, and not to vse the workes of assurance of thy protection. And therfore, we humbly pray thee, gracious Lord God, & most louing father, to pardon our sinnes, which are the greatest aduersaries that can rise vp against vs. Thou sendest good and religious kings to a people, from whom thou expectest the fruits of holy obedience.

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer to bee vsed of such as are of the Kings Maiesties priuie Counsell.
               
               
                  IF men, of meanest professions bee moued by common reason, to seek vnderstanding to manage their own priuate occasions: how much more ought men of most eminent places, especially Counsellors to Kings, craue wisedome and fitnes of God, for so high a calling? How can they consult, deuise, deliberate, direct and determine matters of weightiest consequence, without extraordinarie gifts of prudence? How can they marshall the care and carriage of him, that hath the care and charge of the gouernment and defence of Kingdomes and people, in peace and warre, not onely in matters

Ciuill, but Ecclesiasticall, Spirituall, and Temporall? Is it a small matter, saith Dauid, to be sonne in law to a King? So may a man say, Is it a small preferment to be thought a fit man to be of the secret counsell of a King? Many thirst, no doubt, and desire this highest honor, who haue not first truely examined their gifts of ablenes to discharge the office according to iudgement: it is not enough to be a deepe Politician, a profound Naturalist; but to be a religious Christian, well seene in the booke of God especially, and in the Lawes and ordinances of the Kingdome: to be of an vpright heart, of a godly conuersation: qualified in the vertues diuino? the first whereof is to respect Gods glory: secondly, the honor of the King, the good of the Church, and Weale publike, to shine before men in godlines▪ for that ministreth ioy & consolation to the good, and terror to the wicked. It is impossible for him to giue good counsell to men, that hath not taken counsell before of God, Psal. 33. 10. And therefore, hee that seeketh not wisdome, where Salomon found it: let hi
                     •

was Achitophel, it will either come to nought, or redound to his owne disgrace, to the dishonor of the King, and hurt of the Church or Common-weale. Great happines then it is to that King and Kingdome, where men of worthie not for their Religion, Prudence, and Integritie, are inuested in that most honorable societie: and therefore much behoueth it all honorable persons, of that most worthy rancke, to commence in humilitie, and in the feare of God, from whence cannot but proceed that true wisedome and sinceritie, which are the truest arguments of the Kings and Subiects happinesse and safetie. And for that these supernaturall gifts no man attaineth vnto by chance, arte, or carnall means; they are to be sought for by prayer, at the hands of him that freely giues them without remuneration, Iam. 1. 5. He then that loueth righteousnes, and is in this eminent place, cannot but desire true Wisdome, and that instantly, in regard of the vertues that accompanie her: As Sobernes, Prudence, Righteousnesse and Fortitude, Wisd. 8. 7. ornaments of highest honor, to such as are of the secrets of Princes.

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer, to be said of euery good subiect, for the good successe of the Counsell Royall.
               
               
                  SAint Paul in the first to Timothie, cap. 1. 2. exhorteth all men to make prayers and supplications for kings and men in authoritie, and yeeldeth such a reason to moue thereunto, as whosoeuer wilfully neglecteth the performance of it, cannot bee guiltlesse of a suspition, that he wisheth not well to the state of the weale publike, in seeming indifferent whether it goe well or ill with the people, whose prosperitie, comfort and securitie consisteth in the right rule of magistrates gouernment. And therefore, is euery Christian bound, by the rule of religious obedience, to pray especially for the King, wherein they cannot omit to pray for his Counsellors of estate, who are (in that they part ake of his secrets, and are of his counsel) a part of the head of that

politicke bodie, whereof themselues are members: and he that refuseth to wish well vnto, and to pray for the good of the head, whereof himselfe is a member, is not worthie to partake of the blessings which good members doe enioy, neither peace nor plentie; But as an vnprofitable droane, to be expulst the Hyue, that the rest, according to their godly desires, may liue and inioy, in, by, & with the head, true peace, religion and mutuall loue, the end of all our prayers: for, vnlesse men in most eminent places, be religious, and vertuously qualified (which is the gift of God) it is impossible for King, or Kingdome, Church or Common-weale, to stand sound or secure: and among all that are in authoritie vnder the King, none are of so eminet place, as are Counsellers of Estate: none haue a more heauie burden, none need more wisdome and integritie then they, for they sway matters of greatest ciuil importance. And therefore none are more obserued, none in deeper danger by the enemies of the King, and Kingdome. Who then will shew himselfe so base, barbarous, or irreligious, as not to afford, among other exercises,

some moment of time, to seeke at the hands of God, the good of these most honorable persons? namely, that their qualities may correspond their high callings, godlines and honestie: the first implying sinceritie in Religion: the secōd ciuil cariage in their place, and iustice towards men: the first for the good of the Church, the second for the Weale publike: with these vertues hath God promised to indue them for his Churches sake, Eccle. 10. 4. And therfore ought euer member of the Common wealth, to pray for them, that Wisdome and Prudence, Faith and Iudgement, Godlinesse and Honesty may be giuen them: for it falleth often, that for the wickednes of a people, good Magistrates become euill; and at the instance of the godly, the euil are made good; for their hearts, their counsels, consultations, and determinations are in Gods disposing, for the good or euill of a King and people: examples whereof are many in the Scripture, 2. Chron. 12. 3. 4. 5. and 2. Sam. 10. Therfore to auoid Gods Iudgements and indignation which may befall vs, for contemning the counsell of the Apostle: let vs pray, not onely in publike

assemblies, but euery man in his priuat closset, in sincere affection among, and aboue other ordinary Magistrates vnder his Maiestie, for the Counsellers of Estate, that God will blesse them with wisdome & counsell from aboue. Rom. 11. 33. 34. So shall the King bee rightly aduised, the Church of Christ rightly ordered, and the Common-weale peaceably gouerned; and all the people shall giue glory to God that giues it.

                   The Iudges of the house of Iacob, & the Gouernours of the house of Israel, did abhor Iudgement, and peruert equity, they iudged for rewards; thinking, as corrupt Iudges doe, that God saw them not in their priuate studies, and therefore could there bee no accuser, consequently no danger follow. But the Iudges were punished, the people oppressed, Sion plowed as a field, & Ierusalem became a heape of stones, Mich. 3. 9. 11. Such desolation followeth, where Iudges are corrupt, where the Priests teach for hire, and the Prophets

prophesie for mony. These may be all set in the table of Iudges. Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill Iudges were coupled together by Micah the Prophet, and therefore may they heare one and the same admonition: namely, that they be diligent to seeke wisdome and learning together, Ye are al Iudges of things in the earth, and in earthly vessels of things Diuine. I indeuour not to teach them, but to moue them to seeke wisdome at the fountaine Iehouah, & of him to learne Iudgement, for he shall be the Iudge of their Iudgements, and he shall reward them that take reward against the innocent. If therefore they would remember and ruminate the exhortatiō of Iehoshaphat, which he gaue to the Iudges in his time, that they should take heed what they did; considering they executed not the iudgements of men, but of God: They would bee circumspect in iudging; and the more, if they considered what Iehu said vnto Iehoshaphat, Wilt thou helpe the wicked, and loue them that hate the Lord? As all Iudges doe, if for affection or bribes they suppresse a iust and preferre an vniust cause. Iudges may bee compared to beautifull women

and wisedome vnable to iudge iustly, and consequently vnfit for so high a function. But thou, louing Father, art ye fountain of wisdome, the directer of the hart, ye mouer of ye tongue, & the giuer of true knowledge: And therfore I do hū
                     bly beseech thee to fill my hart with wisedom from aboue, my will with equity, & mine vnderstanding with iust iudgement, that I, laying aside all mine own wit, policy, & pretended prudence, which naturally is meerely carnall, may only rely vpon thy holy & heauēly direction, and obtaine it, that I rightly cōceiuing the equity of all causes, that shal be tendred vnto my censure, I may iudge iustly between parties without respect of persons: & that I may truly imitate thee, who art iust in thy iudgements, & acceptest no person for reward. Giue me an vnderstāding hare, to distinguish between truth & falshood, between ye wronged & the wrong-doer, that I punish not the iust, & let ye wicked goe free. Let no priuate respect (Lord) eyther of mine owne benefit, or steeding a friend, miscarry my iudgement: but let thine owne glory and

reueiled will, moue me to deale euermore iustly: knowing that I fit not to execute mine owne will, or mans iudgement, but thine: And if I wilfully erre, thou wilt not hold me guiltlesse, but wilt iudge me vniust, and punish mee iustly: Let not the opinion of the multitude, either ouersway the truth in me, or terrifie me from giuing sentence, according to equitie: And let me neuer be wearie of well doing, but if cause so require it, giue mee strength, as thou diddest to Moses, to heare, and iustly to determine all controuersies, from morning to night: giue me a sincere heart, free from malice and reuenge: close mine eyes, shut vp mine eares, and claspe my hands, that neither affection blinde me, nor bribes peruert iudgement in me: but that I may doe all things to the glory of thy name, euer ayded by thy holy Spirit, in and for thy welbeloued Sonnes sake, Christ Jesus.

                  THe necessitie of establishing Iudges and Magistrates, to gouerne, direct, and punish, doth giue vs to vnderstand, that such and so many are the corruptions of our crooked, deformed, and rebellious nature, at could not but breake into most inhumane, vnnaturall, impious, and dangerous actions: as, if it were not preuented by la
                     •
                  es, ordinances, punishments, and executions, would breede speedie confusion among men. And were there not Magistrates and Iudges, to arbitrate and administer iustice and iudgement, euery man would be Iudge, & reuenger of his owne pretended wrongs, and would doe right to none: he would maintaine his owne euill wayes to be vpright, his oppressions to be iustice, and his actions, were they neuer so impious, to be lawfull and right: the weakest in power, in their iustest

complaints, should be iudged vniust. Wee may obserue, notwithstanding lawes and statutes, that in stead of Iustice, and righteous dealing among men, Rapine, hatred, dissention, wrongs, and murders vniuersally abound: and what might we thinke, would bee the state of things, if Iustice should cease to execute her office, and offenders goe without punishment? Would not cain kill Abel? Would not Haman conspire against Mordecai? Would not Iesabel murther Naboth for his vineyard? Would not Shemei raile vpon, nay, take away the life of Gods Anointed? Would not Achan take the excommunicate thing? Would not Iudas betray his master? Nay, would not Zimri and Cozhi commit wickednesse openly? Would not all, and all sorts of men run out of rule, and would not sorrowfull confusion soone follow? God foresaw this, when he prescribed the lawes in two tables, and constituted gouernours to keepe the people in obedience, by inflicting punishments vpon offenders, and to defend the cause of the innocent. Moses, and his Centurions, first gouerned the multitudes of Israel: then I

after them Judges, and lastly Kings: and were it not, that Iustice continued her force, neither Church, nor Common-weale could stand. If God should deale with vs, as oftentimes he did with his owne peculiar people, the Iewes, for their sinnes, namely, to send vs corrupt Judges, irreligious, and tyrannous Magistrates; would it not be vnsauory vnto vs, and burdensome for vs? And nothing more procureth it, then our disobedience to God: and there is no other mean to free vs, but our obedience to godly and religious Magistrates, and to the wholesome & Christian lawes, established for our peace: not for feare of punishment, but for a religious conscience sake. If we obey God, we cannot, but loue and obey such as he hath set gouernours ouer vs: and if we loue them, we cannot but pray for them: not as they are men onely, and as they are members of Christ, mysticall body with vs: but as they are Gods ministers, and beare the sword, to correct the guilty, and to defend the innocent. Let no man thinke it therfore, a superfluous, but a Christian duety, to pray for Iudges, and superior

                  Magistrates, that God will indue them with graces and gifts, answerable to their callings, as with Wisedome, Iustice, Righteousnesse, right Religion, Courage, and Christian integritie: that they doing their dueties as gouernours, we may, as rather led by their godly examples, then by their seuere iustice, neither feare the punishment for disobedience to Gods Magistrates; nor they our gouernours, the threats denounced against such as peruert Iustice and Judgement.

knitting her selfe to a ribald, a religious man or womā, vniting her self to a wicked and irreligious partie, become one holy body. How can it be, but the euil wil rather peruert the good, then the good reforme the euil? For al men and women are by nature more apt to be ouercome with duill, then to permit their euil to be ouercome

And how standeth the coniunction of the religious, and prophane, of the beleeuer and the infidell, of the godly and the wicked, with the former ends? Can there be concordance, or sweete societie betweene these contraries? It may be said, that the vnbeleeuing wife shall th

for the vnbeleeuing wife must learne to beleeue of the beleeuing husband, and the vnbeleeuing husband, of the beleeuing wife, and so bee saued: otherwise, he or she shall not be saued: for euery man and woman shall be either saued by his or her owne faith, or not at all. But for a man or woman, for any carnall respect, to aduenture coniunction with the contrary minded, and qualified, tempteth God, and consequently, in steade of a promised blessing to them that marry in the feare of God, a threatned curse followes them. The godly wife of the religio

                     s, husband, shall be as a fruitfull vine vpon the walles of his house, his children, like oliue branches, round about his table: Thus shall the man and wife bee blessed that feare the Lord. This blessing yet consisteth not in the fruitfulnesse of the wife, nor multitude of chlidren onely: for so haue many heathens bene blessed, that neither know God, nor feare him. But the substance of the blessing is in the vertues, and religious carriage of the louing wife, and in the obedience and goodnesse of the children, wherewith God will blesse a godly man, and vertuous wife:

for there cannot be (in it self) a greater burden or crosse to a vertuous father, then to haue many, and they vitious children. It behooueth therefore these kindes of vnmarried persons to obserue, in this weighty action, some necessarie rules: the first, not to consummate the contract, without approbation of their parents or gouernours: secondly, if either partie respect any priuate end, more then the vertue, and religious conuersation of the other: that partie giues testimonie, that it is not the feare of God, that he, or she standeth vpon, but the satisfaction of his or her carnall affection, which commonly is met withall, in the iustice of God, with many crosses and domesticall or forraigne afflictions: wherefore, it behoueth euery man or woman, thus intending to couple him, or her selfe in marriage with any, to aske counsell of God in prayer. So, no doubt but God, according to his promise, will be the marriage maker, and yeeld them mutuall continuing comfort one of another. But if they rashly run into it, without the approbation; and allowance of the word of God, it is

seldome auoided, but mischiefe or misery succeedeth.
               
                  A Prayer to be sayd of a man or woman vnmarried, intending to marrie.
                  O Gracious, euerliuing, and most louing Lord God, vouchsafe, I humbly beseeth thee, as thou in the beginning diddest create man and woman, and diddest institute the holy order of marriage, that the one of them might be a helper vnto the other, and hast confirmed and approued this holy coniunction, by many diuine examples of thy blessed presence: As also by thy prouidence, in ayding and assisting the vnmarried depending on thee, to make their choice according to the rule of right religion: Be pleased, Lord, that I feeling in my self a desire to enter into this sacred order, may be directed by thee, that (I setting apart all carnall respects, as chiefe motiues) I may aime onely, and altogether, to make such a choice, as aboue all things may please thee, who art the authour

and giuer of all goodnesse, without whose prouidence and direction, things of meanest importance cannot be effected, without great affliction and danger: And by whose fauour & mercy, things of weightiest consequence are easily and most comfortably brought to passe. Forasmuch therefore, gracious father, as this mysterie of marriage is most high and honourable among all men, the bed vnde

                     led: Let mee not rashly runne into my choice, as if mine owne wisedome or naturall policie could worke my contentment or comfort. But aduise thou me, and direct me, O Lord: and although I confesse it not expedient, that I should expect from thee publike reuelatiō, or visible Angels to leade me: yet let thy holy Spirit so guide mine affections, that I like not whom thou thinkest not meet to be conioyned vnto me in thy feare. But let all things so succeede my proceedings, as may argue and assure me of thy fatherly furtherance and diuine allowance; as thou diddest in all things further, with blessed successe,

the seruant of Abraham, in choosing a wife for Isaac: So let all things, O Lord, be blessed vnto me: preuent mine owne desires, if they concurre not with thy good pleasure, and alter my will and intention, if they answere not thy will, and giue me an vnderstanding and feeling heart, that I giue not way vnto my naturall motions, and vaine inclination, which in this single estate often ouerswayeth in me the rule of right reason. And graunt, that I may duely consider, that two thus conioyned, shall be made one flesh. And therefore, not vnaduisedly to be attempted, lest of a member of Christ my Sauiour, I should make my selfe the member of some prophane and wicked person: which is not in my power or policie, but in thy prouidence, to preuent. Preuent it, Lord, and whomsoeuer thou pleasest that I imbrace, we may bee both made one intire bodie, sanctified throughout in Christ Iesus, that our vnion being thus made holy, it may resemble that heauenly vnion, which is betweene Christ and the

Church his spowse: And let our hearts and affections bee so truely and intirely knit together in thee, that after the consummating of this sacred mysterie betweene vs, there may succeede no cause of disparadgement, no breach of thy sacred ordinance, nor any offence i

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer to bee sayd of married folkes.
               
               
                  NAture teacheth euery man and woman to loue themselues: what then, but the peruersenesse and crookednes of our natures, maketh that a man, and his wife, being of two made one flesh, should not loue, nourish, and cherish one another, as the Lord loueth and comforteth his Church? Neuer man yet bated his owne flesh, saith Saint Paul: And therefore, Euery man ought to loue his wife, as himselfe, and let the wife see that she feare her husband, Ephe. 5. 33. Whereby it appeareth, that vnder loue and feare, are comprehended the speciall dueties of man and wife, one towards another. Loue importeth all desire of ayding and helping, and feare implyeth all care and diligence, to preuent occasions of offending one the other. To this kind of mutuall loue and feare (if it bee in the Lord)

are promised many blessings, peace, plentie, fruitfulnesse, and sweetest contentment. But if it be counterfeit, and vsurped, contrary to the holy ordinance of God: namely, for carnall respects onely, there will follow, in stead of comfort, crosses, contentions, and many discontentments. And therefore, it much behooueth men and women, thus of two made one, to consider the endes of their vniting: whether they asked first counsell of the Lord by prayer, had the consent of parents, and approbation of the word of God. If so, then to bee vnfeinedly thankefull to God, by whose prouidence they became man and wife. If they find any impediment, or defect in their first insinuation, communication, or consummation of this high and holy mysterie, they are speedily to appeale vnto God for pardon, for their not crauing his ayde in so weightie an action: and to redeeme their rashnesse, by vnfained repentance and prayer. Such is the frailtie of our natures, as the most men and women erre in this point, from the rule of right religion: hauing their affections,

either naturally blinde, and miscarried, or by the meanes of parents sinisterly wrested. Lust and Lucre are two mayne cords to draw the affections of men and women, from making conuenient choice, according to the rule of Gods word, following their owne idle and vaine fantasies; comming together not as Christians, in the feare of the Lord, and in sincere loue: but, many, after a beastiall and brutish manner, heaping vpon themselues shame and miserie: Their dissembled loue, proues hatred, their vowes falsified; the promise of each to other plighted, wilfully and perfidiously broken. It behooueth therefore all men and women, thus coupled together in marriage, to be especially mindfull of their dueties to God: for without the sauour of God, no true duetie can bee performed by either to other, to their children or families.

                     Tokens of a good husband are, to be louing to his wife, to be wise in his words, to be milde in his conuersation, to be faithfull in his promises, to bee circumspect in his gouernment,

to bee carefull for the education of his children, to bee discreete in disposing of his goods, to bee patient in troubles, and to order his family religiously.
                     Tokens of a good wife: to be no common gadder abroad, to be modest and graue in companie, to be neat, and alwayes well busied in her house, carefully to saue what the husband gets, to attend, and tender her children motherly: to bee modestly silent, patiently to suffer, constantly to loue her husband, prouidently to care for her household: And the husband, and the wife to bee religiously carefull to please God together. So shall God bee pleased to blesse them in all things, in their going out, and comming in, in their house, and in the fieldes, in their goods, and good name, in their children and families, and whatsoeuer shall concerne their comfort in this life, and the life to come.
                  
               
               
                  
                  A Prayer to be sayd of married folkes, either priuatly or mutually together.
                  O Heauenly Father, that madest in the beginning, all things of nothing, man of the dust of the earth, and woman of the man: that as she came of the substance of the bodie, flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones: So to be reunited vnto man, and in a mysticall manner, became one body with him, by the holy institution of marriage: which we hauing, by thy prouidence in thy presence, solemnized, by our mutuall coniunction: wee pray thee in Iesus Christ, to blesse vs, according to thy promise in all things: And although through our naturall, and originall weakenesse, we cannot but confesse, that we haue erred from the right, and religious rules of thy holy ordinance, in yeelding too much vnto our owne carnall desires, foolish fantasies, and fraile affections: Pardon vs, we humbly pray thee, knowing, and wee confessing, that flesh and blood cannot

so precisely containe: but that it will fall into many noysome desires, offending thy Maiestie. Clense therfore, O mercifull Lord God, clense our hearts, and conforme our conuersations to thy will, giue vs power to abandon all lightnesse, wantonnesse, and vanities, that we may become truely and religiously affected one towards another, keeping our selues cleane, without incastitie, & without any violating of thy holy ordinance, in thought, word or deede: and our hearts and bodies vndefiled: That with the more integritie of loue, and heartie obedience towards thee, we may passe our limited course of this life. And forasmuch as thou knowest, Lord, that many crosses commonly accompany the estate of wedlocke: and many, both domesticall and forraigne troubles, distract our affections, especially, while wee remaine in our naturall vanities, season them gracious Lord, whatsoeuer they be, or shall be, with thy fauour and loue: So shall they not proue the fruits of thy displeasure,

but of thy meere goodnes, to keepe vs vnderthine obedience. Lest our continuing tranquility & prosperity should cause vs to forget thee: Giue vs, we beseech thee, holy conuersations, that we may euer walke before thee in all vprightnes, that we may prosper in all our wayes, by thy blessing: grant that our children may grow vp in all goodnes, vertues, honesty, religion, & to means, whereby they may passe this their pilgrimage, with much spirituall comfort in Iesus Christ. Increase, according to thy good pleasure, our stocke & store, multiply thy many & blessed benefits vnto vs, & performe thy promises vnto vs and vnto our seed, as thou didst to Abraham, Isaac, & Iaacob, and to their seed: make vs & our seed faithfull, that we may be blessed with faithfull Abraham, and as the house of Obed edom was blessed for the Arkes sake: so, Lord, blesse vs with thine own presence, that we, & the house wherin we remaine, may be euer blessed, and all that belongeth vnto vs, Through Iesus Christ our only mediatour.
                  Amen.
                  Lord increase our faith.
               
            
            
               
               A MOTIVE TO Parents, to stirre them vp to instruct and pray for their children.
               
               
                  THere can bee no stronger band of loue and mutuall affection betweene humane creatures, then is, or ought to bee betweene parents and their children; being of one flesh & blood. But this loue appeareth in some by counterfeit markes, as by their continual care, carke & toile in the world, to get wealth to inrich their posterity: Some in a doting maner, pamper vp & decke their children like peacocks, making them admired guls, for their vanities: Some through a blind affection, not only permit, but incourage their children, to take their vaine delights and pleasures, in dycing, carding, company keeping, drinking, and in all kind of vnseemely, riotous, and irreligious courses: and some Ignorants of the world, commende such foolish, and doting parents: But not onely Religion, but meere

humane reason condemnes this kinde of loue, and holds it rather madnesse then modestie, rather wickednes then wisdome: for Seneca saith, It is impossible for that man to be of a vertuous disposition, that is wantonly brought vp, in rioting and pleasures. Wise parents and religious, care more how to bring vp their children in honestie, vertue, and in the feare of God, then how to make them to liue wealthily, pleasantly, and gloriously in the world. They consider, that it is better for their children to be esteemed of the good, for their vertues, then to please the phantasies of their fond parents, and others, by their beautie, brauery, comlines, and the liniaments of their bodies, which are most graceful in their silly parents singular opinions: yet is it a common course of worldlings, to care more for the bodies, then for the soules, more for the wealth, then for the wisdome; more for the health, then for the happines, and more for the present prosperitie, then for the future saluation of their dearest children. A preposterous kinde of loue, and contrarie to the counsell of the holy Ghost, who teacheth parents to learne their children

the lawes of God, as Deut. 6. 7. Thou shalt rehearse them continually vnto thy children, & shalt talk of them, when thou tariest in thine house; & as thou walkest in the way, and when thou liest downe, and when thou risest vp. In all places, at all times, and by all meanes, parents ought to instruct their children. It is reputed a great glorie, and a speciall blessing to haue many children: but it is not the number, but the vertues of them, and the comfort parents take of their godly qualities, that giueth the blessing. Gideon or Ierubaal had 70. children, and one of them (Abimelech) slew threescore and nine of them. What comfort or consolation can parents looke for of prophane and irreligious children, but griefe and vexation of spirit? It behoueth parents therefore, not only to take care of the instruction of their children, and educating them in the feare of God, but to pray for a blessing vpon them also. For parents may teach, and children may heare, but without a blessing from God, it little profiteth. Paul may plant, Apollos may water: but it is God that giueth the increase. Eli could say vnto his sonnes that were wicked, Doe

no more so, my sonnes, do no more so: but they reformed not, but were slaine by Gods iudgements, and at the newes, Eli their father fell backward from his seat, and brake his necke. Adramelech and Sharazer, impious sonnes, kild Senacherib their wicked father. If euer there were a time of necessitie for parents to instruct, exhort, rebuke, reprooue, and pray for their children: This corrupt age, of necessitie requires it: for there is none so ignorant, but may obserue the irreligious, vaine and vnbridled courses of children of both sexes, who without the especial grace of God, we see daily to fall into so grosse inormities, as draw downe vpon them their swift confusion, to the perpetuall shame, intolerable griefe, and deserued ignominie of their carelesse parents.
               
                  A prayer fit for parents to make vnto God, in the behalfe of their children.
                  O Gracious Lord God; father of mercy and louing kindnes: I giue thee hearty thanks for thy goodnesse, in blessing me with

the gift of children: Blesse me also with wisedom and vnderstanding, to instruct them in the knowledge of thee, to educate them in thy fear, to confirme them in thy faith, and to winne them to thy loue. This dutie thou requirest at the hands of parents towards their children, and punishest the neglect thereof, as in Eli. Powre downe, Lord, therfore, into the hearts of my children, thy holy Spirit, that they may become fit members of that mysticall bodie, wherof Christ thy Sonne is the head: leade them by thine own right hand in the way of knowledge, faith, and obedience: that their obedience beginning at them, it may extend vnto vs, their parents: and assist vs, that we may teach them, instruct them, rebuke them, reproue them, and wish all goodnes vnto them, which yet is altogether fruitlesse, without thy blessing and grace; fruitlesse in respect of our selues, their parents, vnlesse thou blesse vs with a holy and powerfull zeale, to performe our parently duties towards them, religiously & faithfully in teaching

them, fruitlesse in respect of them, vnlesse thou inable them by thy holy Spirit to learne and imbrace such religious & wholesome documents, as thou mayest be pleased to furnish vs with, for their instruction. Season my heart, I humbly beseech thee, with a holy desire to seeke their saluation: and season their harts with an humble and holy inclination to obey thy truth. All humane creatures are prone to sin against thee; youth especially, who are most apt to fall into many forbidden vanities and therefore need they not only continuall instruction in, and to goodnes, and debortation from sinne, but continuall watchfulnes, and careful diligence, to obserue and follow the good, and to preuent and auoid the euill; which neither we their parents are able sufficiently to teach, nor they our children to performe by nature: furnish vs therfore, most gracious Father, with vnderstanding and apprehending hearts, that we in teaching neglect not our dueties, nor our children in learning and obeying

thee, be foūd vnwilling. Teach vs all thy word, O Lord, that wee may direct our duties, and frame our conuersations thereby, that wee and they may walke before thee, and bee vpright. Incline their hearts and their affections vnto such course of life, as in thy prouidence may best stand with their ingenious inclinations, for their honest reliefe in this life▪ knowing that all are bound to betake them to some vocation or calling in Church or Common-weale. Direct them therefore by thy prouidence (good Father in Christ Iesus) that they may imbrace such callings, as may best stād with thy glory, and their comfort: adde blessing vpon blessing vnto their honest endeuours: giue them religious hearts and holy mindes, that in sinceritie of conuersation they may walke before thee, and euermore discharge a holy and Christian dutie, before, and among men: and neuer leaue them, Lord, vnto their owne naturall corruptions, which are strong cordes, to draw them

from good to euill, from obedience to rebellion. Let thy grace beare chiefe sway in them, that they may euer and in all things, prosper in this life: not as worldlings in fulnesse of forbidden pleasures, and carnall contentments, but in a competent estate of this lifes necessaries, as able rather to giue vnto thy needie members, then to be inforced through penurie, to want or begge their bread. I recommend them, Lord, into thine owne Fatherly disposition and protection; they are thine, left vnto me by thee: and therefore, good Father, take a fatherly care ouer them, that in this life they may so liue, as after this life, they may be made partakers with thee, of the heauenly inheritance, in Christ our Sauiour.
                  Amen.
                  Lord increase our faith.
               
            
            
               
               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer, to be vsed by children for their Parents.
               
               
                  THere is, or ought to bee such a sympathy, or mutuall passion of affection betweene children and parents, as one grieueth not, but the other soroweth; the one reioyceth not, but the other is glad; what measure of good or euill the one enioyeth, or suffereth, the other partaketh. But the burden of care lieth vpon the parents, feares, griefes, sorrowes, paines, and expences, in fostering, protecting, educating and instructing their children. Therefore ought children to endeuor with al diligence, & diligent carefulnes to loue, reuerēce, obey & performe whatsoeuer may work to the cōfort of their parents, not only in outward obedience, but in inward, and a sincere affection of the heart, neuer forgetting their parents paines, patience, & perplexities, which for their childrens sake

they vndergo and endure. Loue them, therefore, yee children, hartily, without flattery; feare them truly, without hypocrisie; reuerence thē vnfainedly, without dissimulation; pray for them zealously, without wearinesse; and do them good cheerefully, without grudging. And when yee haue done all the good offices that ye can, yet shal ye be continuall debters vnto your parents, especially to such parents, as striue religiously to educate you godly: for it is not the wealth parents leaue you, but the wisdome they teach you; not the pleasures they permit you, but the practise of honestie they learne you, that shal steed you most, and help you best in life and death. Good and gracious children are an ornament to their parents, more then their wealth or beautie; but irreligious, wicked, wanton, riotous, and rebellious children, the shame and sorrow of them, more then their wits weaknes, or their bodies deformities: But where there is a religious, and a holy mutuall affection betweene parents and children, and loue and obedience of both to God, infinite blessings, corporall and spirituall, cannot but follow. Dauid

was olde, and had beene yong, yet neuer saw hee godly parents forsaken, nor their godly children to want. And where this sweete harmonie is betweene parents and children, there cannot faithfull and mutuall prayer but bee, on all sides, frequent: and blessings on all sides shall follow, both vpon parents, who haue a promise, that they shall see their childrens children, and peace vpon Israel: and children shall haue their daies prolonged, in peace, plentie, and all happinesse. Therefore I counsell all children of discretion, to bee euermore louing, and obedient to their parents, and be euermore conuersant in praier to God for them. And because it is no ordinarie thing for youth to bee able to pray, by nature, let them inwardly hunger, and desire with inward sighes to God, the good of their parents, and the increase of Gods blessings and benefits vpon them and themselues; and endeuour by little and little to vtter words, as God shal enable them, in secret to God, who knoweth their desires, and will grant what they in heart require, tending to the obtaining of spirituall graces, for themselues and others. And for their better

furtherance, I haue set downe this weake Motiue, and a forme of Prayer fit to be vsed of all good children (or the like) for their parents, according to the flesh, as also for such as are any way helpers in their vertuous and religious educations.
               
                  A Prayer fit for children to vse for their parents.
                  GRacious Lord God, and louing father, in thy beloued Sonne Iesus Christ: as thou hast brought me into this world, by the carnall propagation of naturall parents, and hast giuen mee a life and being heere in the earth, and afforded me of thy great goodnes, some measure of naturall and spirituall vnderstanding, whereby I apprehend a dutie, which I owe vnto my parents according to the flesh: So giue me grace, I humbly pray thée, to performe all dutifull obedience vnto them in thee: and grant that their godly care, and religious endeuours, tending to my education & instruction in the true knowledge and feare of thee, may

Accept my hartie thankfulnes, O gracious Lord God, for thy spirituall blessings, and for thy goodnes towards me, in not only taking me out of my mothers womb, wherin I had perished, and she with me, hadst not thou beene the Author of her strength, and my deliuery: but also in preseruing me from many, both spirituall and corporall dangers, whereby I could not but haue vin many times confounded, without thy goodnesse and prouidence, in giuing me carefull and louing parents, who vnder thee haue beene the meanes of my often preseruation. What recompence, Lord, shall I giue vnto thee, for thy great goodnes, and manifold mercies towards me? Thou requirest no sacrifice, but obedience, which with thee is more precious, then the offering of many Bullocks and Goats.

               A MOTIVE TO stirre vp Masters to a godly gouernment of their seruants, and to pray for them.
               
               
                  AS there is areciprocal dutie between the husband & the wife, between the parents & their children; so is there likewise betweene masters and seruants. In euery of these there is a superioritie, and a power to command: and Subiection mouing inferiours to obey. It is a great priuiledge that masters haue ouer their seruants; yet not such as some masters doe impose vpon their seruants: for although they haue a libertie to gouerne and to command, it is not so absolute, but it hath it limitations and bounds: for now as well seruants as masters beleeuing the promise, are equally within the couenant. And therefore seruants (although bound to corporall masters, as touching their bodily seruice) are yet the Lords free men, and so fellow-members

of Christ with their beleeuing masters, which maketh them brethren in the Lord, whose feare should preuent too much seueritie in the master, & moue the seruant to the more obedience and faithfull seruice. The strength of Israel said vnto me (saith Samuel) Thou shalt beare rule ouer men, being iust, and ruling in the feare of God. Heere is the bound and limit of mans authoritie ouer them whom they gouerne. Iustice and the feare of God, whereby we are taught, that masters are not to quarell with, and threaten their seruants, or afflict them without good cause, they may not vniustly taxe them, or correct them; neither ought masters to conceile, but teach them their trades and mysteries. The feare of God imports a diuine office, which the Masters owe vnto their seruants; and that is, to indeuour to make them the true members of the Church of Christ, by godly education, and counsell, to vse the authoritie they haue ouer their seruants, modestly and holily, seeing that they in another respect haue a common Master which is in heauen, who will iudge both the bond and the free, the master & the seruant, without respect

of the ones glory, and the others basenes; of the ones authoritie to command, or the others seruitude and bondage: and it is not commendable for masters, too much to insult ouer their seruants; or mistresses and sterne dames, to tyrannize ouer their maydes, who were begotten, borne, and brought forth in as glorious a maner as the proudest, richest, and most vaine-glorious master or dame; wh
                     •
                   haue but gotten, as it were, the start of their seruants by Gods permission, who (as we daily may see and obserue) hurleth downe, and confoundeth the most imperious and insolent masters, and exalteth the humble and obedient seruants: yee masters and dames, threaten not, nor abuse your seruāts, they are but lent you, for your ease and seruice, by their, and your Father, and Master for a time, who will take an account of you, how you haue gouerned them; and of them, how they haue serued and obeyed you: and if you take astrict account of euery offence committed by your seruāt; how think you that your Master which is in heauen, should winck at, or passe by your many transgressions against him, as if

there were a priuiledge for you to offend the God that made you men and women, and made you masters and gouernours ouer men and women, your gouernmēt being but only carnall, and their seruice but corporall▪ whereas your Master which is in heauen, gouerneth, spiritually, and your seruice towards him ought to be holy and truely spirituall. And thinke that if your seruants disobedience be offensiue vnto you; what are your sins and rebellious courses of life vnto God your great Master, which seeth your sinnes in secret, and will reward them openly? Make the case of your corporall seruants disobedience vnto you, your case of disobediēce to God: and consider, whether you could be content that euery sinne you haue committed, should haue it due reward: would it not be a terror vnto you, and make you lesse furious, and lesse bitter vnto your seruants, for euery trifle in committing of a fault, or omitting some small dutie to be done? I mooue not this, to defend or incourage euill and disobedient seruants: but to aduise masters, and women commanders to vse Christian counsell to their seruants,

and to gouerne them in the feare of God, according to the rule of religion: and let none of them thinke it a needlesse, a superfluous, or a base dutie, for masters and gouernours to pray for their seruants, and such as are vnder their commaund. But let them know, it is a duety required of, and performed by all godly masters and dames, that God may be pleased to make them honest, religious, and fit for the businesse wherein they vse them, to make them dutifull and obedient, fearing God; so shall such masters and gouernours be blessed, for such godly & religious seruants sakes, vnder whose hands, all that they doe, shall prosper. And to this purpose I haue framed a forme of prayer, which (or some other to the like purpose) such Masters and Dames may vse, as desire the meanes to haue good and gracious seruants: and whosoeuer scorneth or neglecteth the means, is worthy to be crossed by their crooked behauiour; and a more excellent meane there is not, then godly counsell, and diuine prayer, to keepe them in obedience.

Let thy holy Spirit be vpon them, to teach them, and to direct

them in all their endeuours. Let them striue in a godly emulation one to exceed another in wel doing, that they may truely and religiously performe whatsoeuer is fit and consonant to their places & functions: for it is neither the skill, nor the desire, nor the seruice done, can succeed, either to my priuate profit, to the good of others, or to thy glorie, without thy speciall direction and blessing. Blesse me therefore in right commanding, and blesse my seruants in rightly performing what in thy feare and reuerence to thy Maiestie they shall attempt. Giue vs all vnderstanding hearts, not according to the high points of humane knowledge only: But especially according to the right rules of Christian religion. Make mee apt, able, and willing, to instruct and direct them in the principles of diuine knowledge, that a spirituall blessing may euer accompany their corporall callings: and giue me patience to forbeare their infirmities, in committing offences against me: for I cannot but confesse, that thou art to me a Master,

                      by my many sinnes, then any, or all my seruants can trespasse against me. Giue mee therefore a feeling heart, O Lord, that I may make vse of my seruāts offences against me, in recounting mine own transgressions against thee. And as thou hast euer bin patient towards mee, in forbearing to punish me according to my disobedience: so I may beare with my seruants weaknes, not maliciously offēding me. Guide thē by thy holy Spirit in all truth; make them (though my seruants in respect of their corporall seruice to me) thy sonnes and daughters, by their spirituall seruing of thee: and grant that we all may conioyne in one true obedience to serue thee, hearing thy word attentiuely, and praying vnto thee continually and faithfully, that both thy spirituall blessings and corporall comforts in Jesus Christ, may alwaies abound amongst vs, and that we may prosper together in all truth, peace, plentie, godly loue and happines, making no spirituall (though there

seeme some worldly) difference betweene ye gouernor, & the gouerned, knowing that thou hast no respect of persons; but the Lord & seruant, the bond and free, the outwardly glorious, and base, fearing thee, are equally accepted with thee.
                  Lord increase our faith.
               
            
            
               
                  A MOTIVE TO stirre vp seruants to obey, and pray for ablenes to serue their Masters and gouernours truely, and to profit in their callings.
               
                  ALthough it seeme a harsh and vnsauourie seruitude, and a base condition to be a seruant, it is not as it is commonly taken; vnlesse to be the seruants of Sinne, and of Satan: but to be a Christian seruant to a Christian master, according to the flesh, is to be Gods free-man according to the Spirit: all creatures are seruants, and seruiceable vnto man: Why then should not one man be seruiceable

vnto another? We cannot be all masters; but seruants we are all, either vnto God in well doing, and in a holy execution and performance of his commandements, to the world, or to Satan. A seruant is nothing else but an agent or instrument to bee commanded by a more eminent person, one whom he obeyeth; whether it be to God, as vnto our Father and preseruer, vnto sinne and Satan our seducers, to the world, as our deceiuer; to our vaine affections, our betrayers; or vnto man, our fellow member of that bodie, the Church, whereof Christ is the head. A Christian and beleeuing seruāt may be in the house, and doe seruice to an Infidell, and an Idolater; as Iacob to Laban, and Ioseph to Potipher, who in their corporall seruice to man, performed spirituall seruice to God, who requireth obedience in seruants to their masters, in all things, not with eye-seruice, as menpleasers, but in singlenesse of heart, cheerefully and hartily, fearing God, as doing their seruice to God, not vnto men: so shall they that are bond seruants vnto men, be made the Lords free-men, and this freedome the Lord doth not onely not preuent, but further

their submission and obedience vnto their masters according to the flesh. Saint Peter commandeth seruants to obey their masters, with all feare, not in a seruile & slauish feare, but a feare accompanied with godly loue, which loue bindeth the conseience of all godly seruants, to deale in all things honestly and carefully for their masters best aduantage, not only when he is present, but when he is absent, to be true and faithfull, diligent and vigilant, imbracing direction, and accepting reproofe with patience. And because these vertues are not of nature, but of grace: It behoueth seruants to bee humble petitioners vnto God, that he wil blesse their labours and endeuours, to giue them vnderstanding hearts, and abilitie of bodie, and dexteritie of wit, to apprehend and performe their duties, both towards God, the high and heauenly Master of all, to their masters in the earth, and for their owne good, in learning, apprehending, and performing the trade, mysterie and function whereunto they are called. And for their better instruction, it behoueth them to giue heede to the word of truth, to frequent the place where the

Word is preached, and to indeuour to practise the same in all sinceritie. And to this effect the Prayer following serueth.
               
                  A Prayer fit to be vsed of seruants.
                  GRacious Lord, & louing Father, I acknowledge my selfe vnworthy to bee called thy seruant, much lesse thy childe; by reason of my great weaknes and manifold sinnes: turne thy louing countenance towards mee againe▪ O Lord, and although I bee a seruant, and subiect to the command and authoritie of another, according to the flesh, as deseruing bondage, by reason of my too much seruing of Satan: Make me yet free in thee, and of the seruant of man, make me thy sonne. Let thy grace so gouerne mine affections, that I be not seduced by the suggestion of Satan, nor by my carnall and corrupt affections, from that subiection and sincere seruice, which I owe vnto my corporall master and commander in thee: In thee, gracious Lord, without whose mercies and grace no seruice can be performed,

nor any true dutie done. I am dull, I am ignorant, I am vnapt of my selfe to euery good worke, but from thee proceedeth the perfection, both of the will and the worke, of the desire and the deede. Inspire into my heart, gracious Father in Iesus Christ, good and godly motions: indue me with a truly obedient heart vnto thee, that so I may truly obey, and sincerely serue in the place thou hast called me vnto: giue mee wisedome, vnderstanding, and dexterity of wit, to apprehend and performe my calling: instruct me perfectly in the mysterie, trade, function, & imployment, which I do professe and practise: for, without thy assistance, I confesse, I can doe nothing as I ought to doe, neyther in the discharge of mine own dutie & seruice to my master, according to the flesh, for mine owne profit or reliefe, nor in answere any duetie in any thing. But thou, Lord, teachest the ignorant, thou guidest the hart, and framest the hand to euery perfit work. Grant therefore that I may discharge my duety in all things, faithfully, religiously, honestly, carefully, & cheerefully vnto my corporal

master, not in eie-seruice only but at all times, in all places, and in all things, that I giue not occasions of offence, by reason of mine ignorance, negligence, idlenes, or disobedience. Giue me a religious hart to serue thee before all men, to feare & loue thee aboue al things, that thy blessing may so possesse me▪ that the goods of my master (vnder my hand) may rather the better, and more and more increase and prosper, then to miscarrie, or diminish for my sake. Labans goods prospered for Iaakobs, and Potiphers for Iosephs sake. So blesse mee, that what I doe, may be blessed, Giue vnto my Master, and confirme in him a wise and vnderstanding heart, that hee may know how to direct and command according to true knowledge in thy word; that he commanding me, and I obeying him in thee, wee may liue godly, peaceably, plentifully, and helpefully together, as long as thou shalt be pleased to continue me in corporall seruice, and after dispose of me in thy mercies, according to thine owne will.
                  Amen.
                  Lord increase my faith.

                  THere is no mystery, trade, occupation, or handycraft, that of it selfe, be the actor neuer so exquisite in skill, neuer so industrious in his labours, neuer so warie in disposing, that can truly and permanētly prosper without the blessing of God. The rising earely, and labouring late, profiteth not, vnlesse Gods assistance be therein faithfully desired, and really obtained. And yet it is too cōmonly obserued, that men of all conditions are too carelesse and backward in this point, standing only vpon their owne wit, arte, and carnall meanes, as sufficient preuentions of future penurie, want and miserie, which, as wee daily see, doe suddenly seize vpon men best qualified, much more vpon the irreligious and prophane men, that thinke their duetie discharged, if they indeuour to get by

their labor, to eate & to spend as they gaine, neuer crauing a blessing at the hands of God vpon their workes, because they feele no present misery: and therefore dreame of the continuance of the meanes to relieue & support them still, forgetting the many causualties that attend euery profession, especially such as depend vpon the labour of mens hands: one by sicknes of the body; a second by the decay and dimnes of sight; a third by the weaknes of his limbs; a fourth by the distractiō of his sences, is disabled to worke in his vocation: besides the many meane of diminishing of goods, as by casuall losses, by fire, by euill seruants; and by many hindrances that may be fall men suddenly. Therefore to preuent these, or the better to prepare to patience▪ it behoueth euery man of these faculties, to deale vprightly, conscionably, and religiously in their professions with all men, to seek vnderstanding in the word of truth, to pray vnto God in faith, that hee may bee pleased to blesse their labors, and to make them prospor: and their conuersations with modesty, honesty, and temperance. So whatsoeuer shalbefal them, shal work

for their good: prosperitie shall make them thank full, aduersity patient, and whatsoeuer they doe, it shall prosper. And for them that are religiously affected, I haue set downe a forme of Prayer, not vnfit to be vsed of all handy-crafts men and artificers.
               
                  A prayer for Tradesmen, Handicraftsmen, and Artificers.
                  GReat and gracious Lord God, mercifull & louing Father in Iesus Christ: thou hast made the glorious & the base, ye mightiest and meanest of condition; some to gouerne, some to labor: I beseech thee, looke vpon me of the lowest ranke in this life. And although I were borne to labor, as ye bird is created to flie, & the fish to swim, let me not be yet, Lord, so abiected, & cast out of the society of men, as not worthy of some place or function in Church or Common-weale.

It were good that these new coined Gentlemen did take their fathers old occupation againe; it will not onely not bee their disgrace, but greatly to their commendation to take the plough taile in time againe, and goe with the oxen, as Elisha did, and to threshing, as Gedeon did; and not to scorne that profession that supports a kingdome. But leauing them that haue looked back, and left the plough, I exhort all men, continuing of that ranck, to reioyce in their labours, that follow that worthiest of humane indeuors, the manuring of the earth; for there is a blessing promised to the religiously painful, & industrious in this kind. Wherfore pray vnto God seriously and faithfully, that it may please him to send a blessing vpon your labors; for you may sow, & set, and plant, yet see smal increase, without the blessing of God. Paul may plant, Apollo may water, but God giues the increase. Cattle, corne, oyle, wine, and all the necessories for mans life, are giuen and preserued by God for man: let vs then pray when we commend our seed to the earth, that God will blesse it with increase: so shall our flocks increase

& prosper also, our oxen shal be strong to labor, there shal be no want, nor complaining in our streets. True it is that the word of God affirmeth, that it raines aswell vpon the corne and the cattle; and all thing

Blesse vs therefore, Lord, and our labours: blesse all that and those that do belong vnto vs. And as thy blessings and plentie shall increase and abound vnto vs; so let our continuall desires to do good, increase, and according to our meanes, be helpefull to the poore and needie, and charitably performe all the workes of true pietie.

                  ll impious and bloodie meanes. How many Countries, kingdomes, nations and people haue tasted of this vnsauorie cup, histories humane and diuine amply intimate. Our own Chronicles record many ciuill miseries to haue infested this kingdome and parts of the same: where insurrections haue begun, especially in the time of the dissention betweene Henrie the third and his Barons, the troubles of the two houses of Yorke and Lancaster, and other like troubles of later memorie. And what calamities haue accompanied this kind of punishment, are likewise at large related in domesticall and forraine, in prophane and diuine histories: namely, famine and pestilence. Samaria being besieged, such was the famine there, as an Ass

                   that rose betweene the King and his Nobles about Pierce Gauestone) inuaded England in so furious and hostile manner, as our Countrie men vnder the crueltie of the enemie, were, besides the generall slaughter, driuen to that penurie and want of victuals, that they were inforced to feed on the former most vnwholsome relicks. The King himselfe could hardly get corne and victuall to sustaine him and his

followers. Some did steale other mens children and ate them: many prisoners were in that height of hunger, as they tooke and tore in peeces newcome prisoners, and ate them raw and halfe dead. And this extreme famine and warre, with the pestilence that followed the warre and the famine, consumed the greatest part of the people in the land: for it is commonly found by experience, that warres follow securitie, famine war, and the pestilence followes famine. A statute was therupon made in respect of the scarcity of bread, that no corne should be vsed in making of drinke: a statute fitly to be in part put in execution at this day, being so highly abused to drunkennes; one of the most capitall sins that draw downe threats of these calamities to be renewed vpon vs. And how is it considered? what preuention is there fought? fulnes & plentie breed securitie, our securitie idlenes, our idlenes Atheisme, Idolatrie, selfe-loue, contempt of God and his word, oppressions, cruelties, pride, riotousnesse, lasciuiousnes, wantonnesse, and consequently the neglect of prayer. And these call for warres, warres for famine, famine for the pestilence:
                  
and these come with armies of euils vpon a people forgetting God, fearefull to be considered: euen the least of these, namely, that which Dauid chose, being inforced to vndergoe one of the three. It is an affliction much against our natures to yeeld vnto; yet more tolerable then terribl

                   warre, or intolerable famine: It threatens death yet with a milder countenance then sterne warre, or meager and consuming famine. But seeing sin is the impulsiue cause of all these miseries, in the fierce wrath of God, who againe is the efficient and working cause; how forgetfull are we wretches, that find in our selues this cause of the causes of our dangers, and will rest carelesse how, by whom, or by what meanes to preuent the comming of them vpon vs? knowing that they are sudden. And if the wrath of God bee inkindled, yea but a little, how shall we bee able to stand in his presence? how shall wee auoid the comming forth, and the execution of his most fierce decree? If one destroying Angell could in one day, by one of these three dreadfull calamities, send so many soules vnto their places, as of the

people of Dauid, and hoste of Senacherib: what may we thinke if he send his other most fearefull ministers together to visit our trespasses? Let vs therfore seek atonement with God in Christ in time. Let vs not play the secure seruants, that perswade them selues, their Master wil be long in comming: if he come and find vs in our drunkennes, and surfering, and bribing, and tyrannizing ouer our weake fellow members, it will bee too late then to seeke to auoid the danger, when the blow is giuen. The very terror of the miseries present will so astonish and perplexe our harts, as we shal run as men amazed for succor, and shal find none; for reliefe, and none will giue it, and for safetie, and none shall bee able to preserue vs from the destroying angels hand. Our faith will faile vs, our prayer will bee cold and not steed vs, when we shall runne here and there as at our wits end, for feare of the dangers before our eyes. O let vs therefore delay no time to flie vnto God, not with our old polluted ragges of sinne and iniquitie, but with renewed hearts and heartie repentance. Let vs meete the Lord as the Niniuites did:

so shall wee recouer our spirituall strength: and if any of these calamities fall vpon vs, wee shall bee hardie in Christ our Sauiour, and with courage meete the enemie in the gap, namely, the sword; vndergoe famine with constancie: and in pestilence rest boldly on the prouidence of him, that hath promised to keepe his faithfull ones, in whatsoeuer danger. And therefore let vs bee mooued to some consideration, that as our fathers haue been visited with these calamities for their sinnes, wee cannot dreame of greater immunitie, considering our sins are as ripe and as rotten as were theirs, and Gods power is not diminished, but his heauie and punishing, and destroying hand is readie to bee stretched out still.

                  GReat and terrible art thou, O God, and in thy furie takest vengeance against a rebellious, stubborne, stifenecked, and a wicked people. Bee patient with vs, O Lord, be patient with vs: and although we be of vnholy cōuersations, spare vs, and be merciful vnto vs. Shoote not the arrowes of thy displeasure against vs, for the least of them is able to wound the hayrie scalpe of thy mightiest enemies, and to crush them in peeces like a Potters vessell. O stay, stay thine anger against vs, preuent warres, draw not thy sword vpon vs, take not the staffe of bread from vs, send not the pestilence among vs; for we are not able to stand in thy fight when thou art angrie. Be appeased towards vs, good Father, in Christ our Mediatour: free

vs of the dangers which wee haue deserued, and which (as wee cannot but feare) doe houer ouer our heads for our sins. Our sinnes are many, monstrous, horrible, and (as it seemeth) incorrigible. Thou hast shaken thy sword ouer vs, wee saw it, and were for the time afraid: thou hast punished vs with pestilence, we haue felt it, and were indangered. Thou hast weakened the staffe of bread amongst vs, wee haue tasted it. And yet we continue in our wonted disobedience▪ we goe on still in our wickednesse, like vnto those rebellious Iewes, that put to death the Lord of life: who are giuen vp vnto a reprobate sence. We also haue eies to see, and yet see not our dangers, eares to heare, and yet we heare not with sense thy fearefull threats for sinne, and thy seuere iudgements vpon them that transgresse thy commandements wittingly: we haue hearts to perceiue, and yet we seeme not to vnderstand those things that belong vnto our peace and punishment; we are not sensible of thy displeasure: but we lull our selues asleepe

with the sweet deceiuing delights of our fleshly affections, and harden our hearts as Adamants against thy word. O gracious Father, giue vs repentant hearts for our sins, vnderstanding harts of thy will; giue vs obedient hearts to practise true pietie and holinesse in faith vnfained, that we may appease thy wrath inkindled against vs through Christ, the Mediatour of all that returne to thee in a holy submission. Turne vs therefore, Lord, and wee shall returne from our euill wayes, and obtaine mercy in him that is our aduocate with thee, Iesus Christ the righteous, by whose intercession it may please thee to spare vs thy people, spare vs: let neither the sword that deuoureth without mercie, come neere vs: let not famine too much afflict vs, that hath no measure in pinching: and let not the pestilence steale vpon vs, that secretly flieth and striketh without respect of person, sere or age. Lord, giue vs repentance, and accept thine owne gift, our repentance and our atonement with thee, that, if it please thee,

these euils fall not vpon vs as wee haue deserued: but being made one againe with thee, thine eye may bee vpon vs euer in mercie to deliuer our soules in death, and to preserue vs in fa

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer in the time of famine or dearth.
               
               
                  FAmine is the most grieuous plague that can befall man in this life: for the want of foode causeth the bodie to pine and consume, it pincheth the very entrails of al creatures, brutish and humane, without respect. In so much as to appease this greedie monster (as it may be termed) men are inforced to feed on things most lothsome, and vnwholesome, instead of things salutarie and good. There may be a Dearth without Famine, but neuer Famine without a Dearth: for to appease the violent furie of hunger, men will giue their greatest Jewels, and in the times of much necessitie, hunger is of so homely a condition, as (where, in the time of abūdance it scorned base and homely meats) she scornes not now the basest nor the vilest things. Famine is a Tyrant, Dearth but a theefe: the one fauours neither poore nor rich, but oppresseth all, without respect of

person, age, or sexe; the other is parciall, stealeth from the poore, and giueth to the rich, it pineth the needie, and filleth the wealthie: and therefore is Dearth vncharitable, vnreasonable, and vnconscionable: vncharitable, in not giuing to the poore: vnreasonable, in not obseruing where most need is: vnconscionable, in withholding from the poore, and giuing to the rich: but they are both the instruments of Gods heauie displeasure for sinne, and therefore not bee preuented or relieued, without true repentance and faithfull prayer. God hath promised, that such as seek
                        •
                      him with a faithfull heart, shall want no maner of thing that is good, and in the time of dearth they shall haue enough. Wo
                        •
                      bee vnto them that in the time of dearth keepe in their corne, and other victuals, to inhaunce the prices; that grinde the facts of the poore; they shall be numbred among the wicked, and their names shall be written among those that haue no loue: but the faithfull shal feed and be satisfied, and the little that the righteous hath shall be better & more comfortable vnto him, then the great abundance of the vngodly. Therfore in the time of this kinde of visitation,

it behoueth all men to pray vnto God, whose power is able to doe wonderfull things, to make a cup of cold water, and a morsell of bread to giue strength, whereupon to walke fortie dayes, as Eliah did, and to increase the small portion that we haue, and to make it powerfull to nourish vs: as to the widow of Sarepthah. Trust thou therefore in the Lord, be doing good, and thou shalt be fed assuredly. They shall not bee confounded in the perillous time, that trust in the Lord, but in the dayes of famine they shall haue enough.
               
               
                  A Prayer in the time of Famine and Dearth.
                  O Great and powerfull, mercifull and louing Father in Jesus Christ, who hast made man to serue thee, and all creatures to serue mā. Look down, wee beseech thee, vpon vs, now in the time of distresse, & want of necessaries to sustaine our mortal bodies. Thou knowest whereof we are made, remember that we are but dust: and our liues are sustained by those thy creatures, that thou hast created

for our vse, which thou hast now so diminished and decreased, as the staffe of our sustinance is broken, and we waxe faint vnder the burthen of thy heauie displeasure. It is our sinnes, Lord, that haue drawne downe this fearefull visitation vpon vs, which we are not able to beare. And therefore, as thou art gracious, merciful, powerfull and prouident, forgiue vs our sinnes, in thy mercie in Christ. Releeue vs by thy power for his sake, and prouide for vs in thy prouidence: call to minde thy mercies of old, wherein thou relieuedst, not only our faithfull Fathers, but such as were strangers also vnto thy Couenant, the Aegyptians, to whom thou diddest send Ioseph to prouide for the Famine to come; a speciall worke of thy wonderfull prouidēce Come now vnto vs, Lord, co

which were to depart from thee, and diddest feede them when they had nothing to eate, and thou gauest them sufficient, with seuen loa

Why therefore should we feare, or despaire of thy prouidence, seeing thou canst feed so many with so little shew of outward meanes; and as thou canst releeue with little in quantitie, so canst thou with things meane in qualitie: Daniel and his fellowes liued by pulse and water, and were more strong, and in better liking, then they that had the ful measure of the Kings choice dainties. Great and wonderfull art thou in thy power, vnsearchable in thy prouidence, and thou art one and the same for euer, thy loue is not diminished towards them that loue thee, neither is thy power weakened, neither can thy prouidence be hindred; but whatsoeuer thou willest, commeth to passe in Mercie and lustice. Will thou therfore, good Father, will thou, and worke our comfort and reliefe, and

whatsoeuer we then need, shall bee supplied vnto vs. Mollify the harts of such as haue reliefe in abūdance, that detain it, to inrich themselues, when the poore perish. S

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer, to bee said in the time of the Pestilence.
               
               
                  THe Pestilence, of all other p
                     ••
                  gues, is the most lothsome & grieuous, especially to the parties infected, for that their dearest friends commonly flie them, and forsake them: none are readily willing to visite them: and yet of all the three ineuitable plagues that God tendred to Dauids election, hee made choice of this, as willing rather to fall into the hands of God, then of mē. To flie before furious enemies in the warres, is a fearefull thing: and to pine and perish for want of food, more grieuous then Death. Therefore is the Pestilence rather to be vndergone, then either the Sword or Famine: but that we are not at our choice, as Dauid was: But as touching sinne, in the same danger. Sinne was the cause of his, and sinne is the cause of our visitation. And therefore, to preuent the danger, we

are to make peace with our offended God, by true repentance, humble submission, faithfull and vnfained prayer. It was the remedie that Dauid vsed, whereby the Lord was appeased with the Land, and the plague ceased, 2. Sam. 24. 25. Gods anger is easily appeased towards them that are truely penitent, and hum

                  y seeke him in faithfull prayer. It appeareth that we haue prouoked the Lord by our sinnes to wrath: and in his displeasure be visiteth vs with this heauie correction. Let vs offer the sweet and acceptable sacrifice of prayer vnto him, in vnfained sorrow for our sinnes. It may be God will recall his destroying Angell out of our coasts: But if he wil not be, appeased, & pleased to stay his hand from punishing: Let vs submit vs to his will in all Christian patience, auoiding, as much as in vs lieth, the wilfull running into the danger; and then if God haue numbred vs among them that he hath marked out vnto death; let vs not bee dismayed, or discouraged: let vs not only not thinke vs the more vnhappie: but far the more in the fauor of God, in that he vouchsafeth vnto vs such a fatherly premonition,

to prepare vs that, which by the course of nature, in few yeares cannot be auoided, death, which seemeth far more terrible then indeed it is: for though it hath the name of bitternes, yet it is indeed the end & cōsummatiō of al the vnpleasing things, which our deceiued affections are miscaried by: it is the end of sin and sorrow, of dangers, feares and miseries; and is terrible to none, but to such as only consider the dissolution of the soule from the bodie, and doe not looke to the immediate coniunction of the soule with God: we leaue indeed our corporall friends behinde vs, whom wee loue: But we ought to know, that we go to a more blessed fellowship in the heauens, to Christ our elder brother, whom wee yet neuer saw: but if wee loue him, as he loued vs first, we cannot but desire to see him, which we cannot doe in our mortall flesh. Let vs therefore with Saint Paul, desire to be dissolued and to be with Christ, with the Angels, and with the spirits of iust and perfect men. And let vs be of good courage in this danger of the body, which if we cānot flie, let vs not feare, knowing that whether we liue or die, we are

the Lords, in Christ, in whom we are assured that all things shall worke together for the best, and to the consolation of them that loue God, in life and death. Weeping may indure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning.

Make vs, we beseech thee, alwayes watchfull ouer our wayes, that we erre not from thy Commandements, in this time wherin many are striken with thy hand, & many are finally fallen asleepe.

not thy patience, and long forbearing of vs, perswade vs, that either thou seest vs not, or that for our owne worthines or desert, thou passest by vs: but rather to thinke, that we are also of the number of them, whom thou hast ordained to partake of this visitation, that wee may apply our selues to a serious calling to mind of our offences, and vnfained repentance for them, before thy decree come forth against vs. Giue a holy preparation vnto our hearts, willingly to submit our selues to thy good pleasure, for life or death, whether of thē thou shalt be pleased to worke for vs: worke in vs for the one, such thankfulnes as thou deseruest, for so great a blessing, as the prolonging of life, and patience in the other; knowing that it is appointed to euery man once to die.

And grant that our soules may euermore depend on thee our God, for of thee commeth our health, and our saluation: haue mercie vpon vs, haue mercie vpon vs, O God; for our soules trust in thee, and in the shadow of thy wings will wee trust, vntill this thy visitation bee ouerpast.

               A MOTIVE TO A Prayer, to stirre vp Souldiers to liue in the feare and seruice of God.
               
               
                  AMong all other professions in the world: none is more dangerous then the militarie: for Souldiers are euer neerest vnto casuall and vntimely death: yet (which is to be admired and lamented) no sort of people are more loosely, lasciuiously, and barbarously giuen then they. Whoredome, Drunkennesse, Rapine, Blasphemie, Oppression, Tyranny, and all kindes of vngodlines, are frequent among them. Much to be wondred at, that men abandoned, as it were, to the mercilesse bullet and sword, should walke so inordinately, as if there were not a God in mercy to preserue them, or in iudgement to confound them. Aboue all men, Souldiers ought to be most watchfull ouer their wayes, and most mindefull of their vncertaine condition, knowing that Captiuitie,

Wounds, and Death, are ineuitable companions of their profession. The verie title of a Souldier importeth two kindes of warfare, externall with corporall, internall with spirituall enemies. If a professed Souldier faint or faile in the first, he is censured cowardly, and not brauely minded, which for outward disgrace hee will seeke to auoide. If he be foiled in the second, men and Angels will condemne his weaknesse: if he preuaile in both, how great is his commendation? If therefore you that be, or desire to bee Souldiers, perfect and complete, subdue and conquer, first your owne inward and priuate enemies: then incounter the common enemie with courage: for, before you haue manfully fought against, and conquered Sinne and Satan, and your owne carnal affections lu

                  king within your hearts▪ you can neuer with Christian courage, confront the visible enemie marching furiously towards you: for he that feareth not, nor serueth God, how valiant so euer hee seemeth outwardly▪ yet feareth hee death, and consequently feareth the

ministers and instruments of death: but whoso feareth and serueth God aright, needes not feare the furie of mortall man, who can kill but the bodie; but the inuisible enemies kill the inward and better part, the soule with the bodie. Therefore seeke you peace, and bee reconciled to God, before you vndertake warre
                     •
                   with man; for if God be against you, if the strength of Goliah, the policie of Achitophel, the power of Senacherib, the hoast of Pharaoh, were all conioyned on your side, you should come to like end, as these vaine men did, that thought themselues inuincible. But if God bee on your side, you neede not feare: One shall bee able to incounter ten, ten shall chase an hundred, an hundred shall put ten thousand to flight. It much importeth you, that would bee accounted martiall men, therefore to walke before God, and to bee vpright: pray vnto him for courage and good successe; but before you pray, you must striue with a godly resolution to abandon all your vngodly behauiour; for, God heareth nor, nor respecteth the

prayers of hypocrites, such as draw nigh him with their lippes, and intreate him in their words, vtterly denying him in their workes. Cast off the common course of prophane souldiours, too well knowne to bee too impious; follow the counsell of Christ, who willeth you to doe violence to none, to accuse no man falsely, and to bee content with your wages, Luke 3. 10. Being thus qualified, repaire vnto God in a liuely faith, vsing all meanes to encrease in diuine knowledge, which begetteth all holy vertues, wherewith being furnished, whether you liue or die, yee shall bee the Lords.
               O Lord increase our faith.
               
                  
                  A Prayer to be vsed of souldiers.
                  OH God of hoasts, look downe vpon me thy vnworthy seruant, who in this life labour both in a corporall and spirituall warfare, fighting within and without: Assist me first with thy grace, faithfully to incounter, strongly to resist, and truly to triumph ouer sin and Satan, who lie in ambush with armies of infernall souldiers, seeking to surprize my inward and better part, my soule, and to depriue me of al godly affections, that so I being conquered within, may not be able rightly to performe my outward calling, wherin thou Lord knowest, I walke in coutinuall danger of my mortall life, hauing of my selfe neither power nor policie, to auoid the ordinarie perils and calamities that accompany 
                        〈◊〉
                      in this course of life. I am much sinfull, and therefore I may the more feare that thou, who hearest not sinners, wilt refuse to goe with me to battell, which euery where, and at all times threatneth mee

with captiuitie, wounds, or death, as one abandoned (in humane opinion) to the mercilesse bullet and sword. Giue me therefore, Lord, a repenting heart, and a truly reformed conuersation, that seeing by so many meanes death houereth ouer my head, I may be euer readie and prepared in a holy and sanctified life, to meet the same without feare; knowing that death is but the issue out of a wildernesse of miseries, troubles, calamities, and dangers, and an entrance into that most sweet, pleasant, and Paradise, plentifull of all good and most wished things: wherein is no warre, but peace; no care, but comfort; no feare, but ioy; no miserie, but mirth; no hunger nor thirst; no want, but aboundance of all good things for the soule to enioy. Make me therefore, O gracious Lord God, an vpright and faithfull souldier in this mortall warfare, that I seeke not, nor sinisterly take the goods, or sh

to sobrietie, modesty, patience, and true magnanimitie and boldnes. Preuent in me wantonnesse, ryoting, drunkennes, swearing, blasphemy, whoredome, and such a profane and vngodly course, as commonly too much accompanieth this militarie life. And seeing, Lord, that I, in duty, am inforced to vse the sword against those that rise vp against vs, blesse the vse of it to me, as thou didst the sling of Dauid, and the sword of Gideon; teach my hands to war, & my fingers to fight. Giue me a couragious heart, & vndaunted spirit, to incounter the enemy as oftē as need requireth: make strong my loynes, and fortifie my armes, let good successe befall our armies: daunt our enemies hearts. Teach our Leaders and Commanders wisedome and Christian policie to direct vs, and giue vs courage, strength and obedience to performe our dutie with good conscience. And if in thy wisedome, peace be more to our profit and comfort, and to thy glory, then warre, send vs peace, in thy name: and let both peace and warre, life and death, bee

Stand euer on our side, and let thy sauing and protecting Angel preserue vs in all danger. Remamber thy louing promises, and thy mercies of old: bee vnto vs a shield and buckler of defence, and a sword of offence against our enemies; accept vs into thy blessed protection: neuer faile, nor forsake vs, O God of hostes. Goe euermore foorth with our armies; keepe euery one of vs free from the excommunicate thing, sin and iniquity: And sanctifie vs with thy holy spirit, that in thoughts, words and deeds we may be approued not souldiers carnally valiant, or desperately bold, but truly and religiously couragious, both in our outward and inward warfare., through Christ: to whom with thee and the holy Ghost be

               A MOTIVE TO a prayer to be said of such as trauaile by sea.
               
               
                  SVch as vse the seas (as Dauid obserueth) and haue occasion to passe the great waters by ship, see the wonderfull workes of the Lord. Wonderfull in deed, in the creation of so huge a heape of waters, wonderfull in containing them within appointed limits; wonderful in ebbing and flowing; wonderfull in violence and rage; wherein sometimes it swelleth and worketh; wonderfull in respect of Iehouah, at whose word the most furious waues therof are appeased. And lastly wonderfull, in respect of man, whom God hath indued with the vnderstanding to frame a vessell, wherein, as in a house, he may safely fly, as it were, through the furious furrowes of so mercilesse waters. But all these wonders may be knitte vp in one, namely, in the wonderfull power and prouidence of Iehouah: who by his word hath made the seas, and gathered

the great waters into one place, and commandeth them not to passe their bounds, and they obey: hee hath giuen man iudgement and art to frame the hull, to place the Roder, to stretch out the Tacklings, and to spread the sailes, to descend into the deepe. But if God should there leaue him to his owne will, wit, power or art, though he haue his card and compasse to guide him, he should neuer attaine his wished port: when the winds blow, the tempests rise, the seas rage, the waues lift them vp as vpon mountaines, and hurle them downe againe as into deepe gulfes. What then can art or force do? Doe not their hearts then melt for feare, vntill the winds cease, the tempests appease, the seas calme, and the waues be still? And who worketh this wished and most comfortable change? only that mightie Jehouah: hee that made the seas, he commandeth them to rage, to shew his power, and againe willeth them to bee quiet, to shew his mercie. Are not these the wonderful workes of God? who but he commandeth, and the seas obey? Ye therefore that are occupied in this dangerous

trade of life, bee not vnmindfull to serue the liuing God: for ye see by experience, how suddenly hee commandeth, and calleth for a tempest, and then ye thinke your selues neere vnto the doore of death Yet, as saith Dauid, When they cried vnto the Lord, he deliuered them out of their distresse, and brought them to the hauen where they would bee. There is none that vseth the seas, but hath seene and felt this. If then they confesse not the power, prouidence, and louing kindnesse of Iehouah, and acknowledge the wonderfull workes that he hath done for them, euen before the sonnes of men: Let them bee assured, that a thousand perils futurely attend them. But the most of them that exercise this kind of trauell, shew themselues temporizers: when dangers appeare, they seeme much humbled, promising reformation of their finfull liues; they pray, and are cast downe with importable feare and sorrow: but the danger past, they forget it, and God that deliuered them from it, especially whē they approch the hauen where they would bee, in safetie, where, in stead of giuing of thanks to God for his mercies, in leading and

conducting them; the first thing they doe, is to shew they owe him no duty, by presently falling to transgresse his will by drunkennesse, wantonnesse, whoredome, swearing and blaspheming him, as though the danger past were the last they need to feare, or could befall them. But they deceiue themselues; for God is patient and long suffering, but neuer forgetteth them in iudgement, that so forget and neglect his mercies. Hee followeth them, when they thinke dangers farthest off: Shipwracke, Pirats, Famine, or some other Iudgement seazeth vpon all carelesse Sea-faring men. Wherefore yee that occupie the Seas, remember, that as in discretion you prepare all needfull things, fit for your Sea voyage: so are there things most materiall to bee prouided tōwards your heauenly peregrination; Godlinesse, Faith, Obedience, true Feare and sincere Loue and seruice of God; which, if you omit, let your corporall prouision bee neuer so plentifull, let your ship bee neuer so strong, neuer so swift of sayle, neuer so well manned and munited, the least breath

of the Lords mouth is able to cōfound you. No men haue more interims, and times of leasure to serue God, then Seafaring men. Why then spend yee not those times in searching the word of God, in prayer, and in holy exercises? that God may be your guide, your defence, preseruer and protector: so shall all things goe well with you, and whatsoeuer ye doe, it shall prosper.
               
                  A Prayer to be said of such as haue occasion to vse trauell at sea.
                  GRacious Lord God, mightie, mercifull and louing Father in Iesus Christ, who hast made all things by thy word: And by thy power and prouidence dost gouerne all, and all obey thee in their kinds, the heauens, the earth and the seas: but man only is disobedient, only rebellious; therefore doe thy creatures whom thou madest to

and the inhabitants thereof, much more such as in thy prouidence are appointed to haue their trauell and trafficke therein; we therefore in al humblenesse come vnto thee, O Iehouah, who art the God and gouernour of the immensible and vnfadomable sea. Thou callest for and commandest the tempests to arise; thou liftest vs the waues thereof, and wee are mounted vp to the clouds, and suddenly descend into the deepe againe. So that we are euen at the doore of death: yet such is thy might and thy mercie, that at thy rebuke they are still, and at thy word the tempest ceaseth. Receiue vs therefore into thy blessed protection, for we recommend our selues vnto the seas in thy name, confessing that it is neither the strength or swiftnes of our ship that can saue vs, neither can our power or policy preuent the dangers of the merciles waues. It is not the Card nor Cō
