man what he ſhould doo when he goeth to bed and when
he riſeth.
            To a new Northen tune.
            
               
                  AT night lye down prepare to haue:
               thy ſléep, thy death, thy bed, thy graue.
               A riſe a wake think that thou haſt:
               thy life but lent, thy breth a blaſt.
            
            
               Let not the ſluggiſh ſléep,
               cloſe vp thy waking eye:
               Vntil with iudgement déep,
               thy dayly deeds thou trye.
            
            
               He which one ſinne in conſcience kéeps,
               when he to quiet goes:
               More ventrous is then he which ſléepes,
               with twentie mortall foes.
            
            
               
                  
                     •
                  herfore at night call vnto minde,
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                   the day haſt ſpent:
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                   if nought amis thou finde,
               if ought betime repent.
            
            
               And ſince thy bed a pattern is,
               of death and fatall 
                     •
                  earie:
               Bedward it ſhall not be amis,,
               thus to record in verie.
            
            
               The ſtretching armes, the yawning breath,
               that I to bedward vſe:
               Are patterns of the panges of death,
               when life muſt me refuſe.
            
            
               The nightly Bell which I heare ſound,
               as I am laid in bed:
               Foreſhowes the Bell which me to ground,
               ſhall ring when I am dead,
            
            
               My bed is like the graue ſo colde,
               and ſleep which ſhuts myne eye,
               Reſembleth death: Clothes which me folde,
               declare the moules ſo drye.
            
            
               The friſking fleas reſemble wel,
               the wringling worme to me:
               Which with me in the graue ſhall dwel,
               where I no light ſhall ſée.
            
            
               The waking Cock that early crowes,
               to weare the night away:
               Puts me in minde the trump that blowes
               before the later day.
            
            
               The ſplendent Sun whoſe golden ray,
               no eye can dure to ſée:
               Declares how in that dreadful day,
               God ſhall appéer to me.
            
            
               The riſing in the morn likewiſe,
               When ſleepy night is paſt:
               Puts me in minde how I ſhall riſe
               to iudgement at the laſt.
            
            
               I go to bed as to my graue,
               God knoweth when I ſhall wake:
               But Lord I truſt thou wilt me ſaue,
               and me to mercy take.
            
            
               Thus wil I wake, thus wil I ſléep,
               thus wil I hope to riſe:
               Thus wil I neither waile nor wéep,
               but ſing in godly wiſe.
            
            
               Repent, repent you ſinners all,
               and call to God for grace:
               That he may graunt vnto vs all,
               in heauen a dwelling place.
            
            FINIS.
