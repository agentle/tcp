               NO man may arrogate to himſelfe the name and title
of a perfect and abſolute Surueior of Caſtles, Manners,
Lands, and Tenements, vnleſſe he be able in
true forme, meaſure, quantitie, and proportion, to
plat the ſame in their particulars, ad infinitum, and
thereupon to retriue, and beat out all decaied, concealed,
and hidden parcels thereof, fitting the ſame to their euidence,
how ancient ſoeuer; although blemiſhed, obliterate, and very much
worne: beſides the quickening and reuiuing of Rents, Cuſtomes, Liberties,
Priuileges, &c. thereunto belonging: with perfect knowledge
of cuſtomarie Tenures and Titles of all ſorts: framing Entries accordingly:
together with good and commendable penmanſhip, as well
for the Plat, as Booke, from the ſame. And for that more abuſe in
concealments, incroachments, &c. hath beene offered in theſe laſt
100. yeeres, than in 500. before, and that many doe now refuſe (as
more heereafter will) to pay their rents and duties, otherwiſe than on
the meeres head (their Lands and Tenements firſt ſingled out, and
ſet foorth vnto them, metis & bundis) I may not terme him ſo much as
a Surueyer, that performeth not theſe difficulties, and ſuch like incident
to Suruey.
