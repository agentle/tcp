Seinge the boldenes, raſhnes and ambition of ſome of our ſayd lords ſubiectes, cōtemning his youth, to haue ben ſo greate, that they haue ben ſo preſumptuous, not onely to aſſemble them ſelfes, &

too entre into armes agaynſte the edicts, and wyth the-ſame, too putte too deathe a great number of his poore ſubiectes, neither ſparing age nor ſick, without any other cauſe at all, but for that they were aſſembled to ſerue God, according to the liberty graūted by the edictes, but alſo not beinge able too be brideled by any lawe of God or manne, with the ſayde force, haue gotten the poſſeſſion of the perſonnes of the Kynge & the Queene, and of the Duke of Orleans.

               ho is in cuſtody and captyue,

to ſubuerte together with religion, the moſte parte of the nobilite and of the thyrd eſtate, & generally all thoſe which make profeſſion, and be of the Kynges moſte faythful and obediēt ſubiects, whiche ſhoulde be a verye meanes to abandon the croune of Fraunce to the ſpoile.
            We for theſe cauſes deſiring, according to our power, too reſtore hys maieſtie & his croune too ſurety, and the Queene too her authoritie, and alſo too preſerue the poore faithfull people of this realme, in that libertye of conſciēce, which it hath pleaſed the Kynge to graunte them by hys edictes, made by thaduiſe of the princes of the bloud, of the lordes of the Kynges coū
               ſayll, and mooſte notable men

aſſembled out of all the courtes of parlaments of this Realme, and by the determination of the moſte parte of the ſtates, which ought to remayne infringed, duringe the minoritie of our ſayde ſoueraigne: We haue ben like good and faythefull ſubiectes, forced and conſtrayned to entre into armes, whiche is the mean that God hath put in our hand; againſt ſuche violence, tyranny, and oppreſſion.
            And hereupon, after inuocation of the name of God, as mē well aduiſed and counſeled, by commune and depe aduiſemēt, we haue of one commune accord and frank and willing conſent, promiſed & ſworne, in the name of the liuinge God, a felowſhip from hencefoorth of a holy companye

one towardes another, touchinge tharticles folowing: whiche we ſweare and promis before God and his Aungels, to kepe and obſerue infalliblye, and from pointe too pointe, as foloweth, throughe the grace and mercy of God our hole and onely hope.
            Fyrſte we proteſt that wee do not cary with vs in this holy alliaunce, any particular paſſiō of mynde, nor regard of our perſones, goods or eſtimations, but that we haue nothinge before oure eyes, but the honor of God, the deliueraunce of the kynges & Queenes maieſties of iuſtice, thobſeruation of the edicts and ordinaunces by theym made, and laſtely the dew puniſhmēt and reformation of the neglectors

of theſame, and for theſe cauſes and none others, as we ſweare and promiſe euery man for hym ſelf, to employ oure bodyes, goods, and al that we mai make, euen to the very laſt drop of oure bloud.
            And thys preſent felowſhip and alliance ſhall continue in full force vnbroken, vntyll the Kynge bee of full age, that is to ſaye, vntyl that hys maieſtie beinge of age, ſhall haue taken vppon hym ſelfe, the gouernaunce of his realme, and then wholy to ſubmit our ſelfes too the perfecte obed

               ence and ſubmiſſion of hys owne will and pleaſure.
            At which tyme we truſt to giue vnto him ſo good reckenyng of the ſaid felowſhip (as we wil alſo

do, as many & as often times as it ſhall pleaſe the Queene, ſhe beinge at lybertie) as men ſhall knowe, that it is not a league or a monopoly, turninge of thinges to our owne commodities that we mainteyne, but a faythfull and dewe obedience for thimportant ſeruyce and preſeruation of their maieſties.
            Secondely, too thende that all menne maye vnderſtande, that thys preſente felowſhippes made with ſuche intent as is rehearſed and in all purenes of conſcience, & feare of the name of God, whome we take for the head and defendor of the ſame: We do meane and ſweare that we wyll not ſuffre in our companyes, anye thynge too bee doone, whiche maye derogate

the commaundementes of God, or the Kinge, as Idolatries, ſuperſticions, and blaſphemies, hoordomes, violences, enforcementes, ſpoylinges, breakynges of Images, rāſakings of Churches, by pryuate authoritie, and generallye all other lyke things forbydden, by God or by the Kynges laſt Edict, ſet foorth in Ianuarye. Of whyche faultes, contrarye wyſe wee wyll endeuoure oure ſelues to ſee puniſhmente and iuſtyce executed.
            And becauſe we are guyded vnder thobedience of the woorde of God, we purpoſe in our aſſemblees to haue good and faithful miniſters of the glorye of oure God, whiche ſhal teache vs hys wil, too whome wee will geue ſuch audience as apperteineth.
            
               
Thyrdely we doe name for the chiefe and conductor of the hoole cōpany my lord the prince of Condee, a prince of the bloud, and therfore a Counſaylor born and one of the protectors of the croune of Fraunce, whome wee ſweare and promiſe to attende vppon, and to rendre towards hym, all dewe obedience, touching that which ſhal concerne the effect of thys preſent aſſembly. Submittinge our ſelfes (in caſe of rebellion or negligence) too ſuche hys correction and chaſtiſemente, as hee ſhall order. And the caſe happeninge that the ſayde lorde the prince, thoroughe wantte of healthe or otherwiſe cannot ſupply the ſayd charge, then he whome he ſhal name, ſhalbe wholy obeyed

and folowed as hym ſelfe▪ And the ſayd Lorde the Prynce declaring the zeale whiche he beareth to the glorye of god, & to the kynges ſeruice, hath accepted y• charge as before, with promiſe to al the company that throughe the helpe of God, he will with all diligence & readines do the true office of a head and conductor, according to the tenour of all the condicions of the ſayde felowſhyp.
            Fourthly we haue comprehended and ioyned vntoo vs in thys preſent treaty, of all ſuche as be of the kinges coūſayll, exceptinge thoſe whiche be in armes againſt their duty, to kepe vnder and reſtraine the kynge and Quene of their will & pleaſur, which force, if they will not

lay doune and retire them ſelfs, and yelde accōpt of their doinge in all ſubiection and obedience, when it ſhall pleaſe the Queene to call them by iuſt occaſion, we hold them giltye of treaſon, & dyſquietoures of the common tranquilitie of thys realme.
            And to proceade to the intent & accompliſhmente of this hole felowſhip, which we proteſt not to be done, but for maintenaūce of the honor of God, the ſtate & libertie of the Kyng, vnder the gouernement of the Quene hys mother: Eche of vs to his perticular, from the loweſt to the hygheſt do ſweare and promiſe before God and his Aungelles, to be in a readines with all that whiche ſhalbe in oure power: as with money, armure, horſes

for ſeruice, and all other things neceſſarye therewith, and too preſent our ſelfes aſſone as we ſhalbe firſt commaūded by the ſayd lorde the prince, or any other, beinge ordeyned by hym, furniſhed and prepared to folowe hym where as he ſhall cō
               maund vs, & faithfully to ſerue him, for the purpoſes aforeſaid, and obſerue our dutye, in body and goods, ſoo farre foorthe as oure lyfe will ſtretche. And if it happē yt in any place or quarter of this Realme, we ſhall vnderſtande that any man cōprehended in this preſent felowſhip receiue any oultrage or violēce by the perſons aforeſaid or others contrary to the Kynges edict in Ianuarye laſte paſte, wee doe whollye ſweare & promiſe ſpedely

to ſuccoure theym, and too endeuour oure ſelfe to the ende that the ſayde wronge may be ſo repaired, as if the dommage and hurte were perticular too euery one of vs: and thys too be done in ſuche ſort as we ſhalbe commaunded by the ſayde lorde the Prince, or any other deputed thereunto by hym.
            Furthermore, if hereafter it happen (which God forbid) that any of vs, forgettinge hys duty and othe, ſhoulde haue anye intelligence with thennemyes, or ſhoulde by any maner or meanes committe any thinge diſhoneſtly or trayterouſly, or elles ſhewe hym ſelfe too reſiſte that whiche is ſpoken of before: We ſweare and promiſe by ſuche parte as we loke to haue in Paradys,

to open the ſame foorthewith to the ſaid lord the prince, or other to whome it ſhal apertaine, and too take and vſe hym as an enemye, trayterous, and vnfaythfull perſon. For thus hath it ben accorded amongeſt vs of a free conſente, not too be reuoked.
